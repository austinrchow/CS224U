Written by Paul Schrader 1992 , forty, light sleeper
Never meant to be a drug dealer, it just came along
He's been other things: messenger boy, cab driver, model, postal clerk, doorman, nightclub shill -- never meant to be them either
Now he's a
Drug dealer
, well-groomed, khaki slacks, leather jacket, tippet-like scarf, belt pouch, "Beatle" boots, a shadow drifting in and out of other shadows, New York, day, night: watching, listening, rarely speaking -- nonexistent, seen only by those he sees
His face an affable blank
Make of it what you will
The eyes flicker; the hands shift discreetly
map of calculation
Once he had a drug problem
Life turned a page
Today he follows instructions: he sleeps light -- one eye open, anticipating
,
, loner, voyeur, has been drifting toward an unknown destination
At mid-life the destination draws near
The circle tightens
The dealer is anxious
The destination is love
: New York by night
nestles in back of a blue car service sedan, face reflected in the window
Neon mixes with steam, street people with tourists, young dates: each with a different agenda, a hidden purpose
His beeper goes off
He clicks it, checks the digital message
The  stops at an uptown corner
opens the curbside door, motions to the  he'll be back in "ten" minutes
He enters the video laundromat, a twenty-four-hour video rental/laundromat/tanning salon
Inside, he meets a - (
Crew Division) in the "Classics" section
They exit
On the sidewalk, money is exchanged for a packet pockets the uncounted cash
The  mouths goodbye, eager to put distance between him and
checks his beeper, stops at a pay phone, dials
re-enters the sedan; the  heads downtown
High-rises give way to Tudor City
Uncollected trash lines the curbs
eyes a ;  looks back
Later
Three a
m
The streets are dark
LeTour's car passes a glowing Korean market
narrates from diary: (voice over) Labor Day weekend
Some time for a sanitation strike
Everybody crazy to stock up
They decide to score at the last minute and want it now
Never fails
The faces look alike
You gotta use memory tricks: each has some peculiarity -- it keeps you sharp
told me when a drug dealer starts writing a diary it's time to quit
started writing after that
Not every night -- now and then
Just to burn off the night
Fill up one book, throw it out, start another
The sedan drives on
End credits
: Four a
m
: streets empty
LeTour's sedan drops him off near a ten-story West 80s apartment building
gives the a forty-dollar tip (standard procedure), turns the corner
He presses the intercom; a buzzer unlocks the door
He enters the lobby, walks past English reproduction furniture toward the elevators
Presses the button
Penthouse  door opens
lets  in with a smile
, forty-four, striking in a tailored dress, greets him with a wet kiss
Her hair is coiffured, her face made up
She is John's employer, mentor, confidante, Mother Hen: she keeps the books
Her ingenuous demeanor belies sterner stuff: she's been in the drug business fifteen years
Ann's apartment is a jumble of sensibilities: dark green walls, zebra-skin sofa, Haitian wall friezes, framed magazine photos of Paramahansa Yogananda, Liz Taylor, the Duke of Windsor -- paintings stacked behind an oversized urn
bird flits in its cage
One corner of the living area is devoted to a fledgling cosmetics business: Macintosh computer, billboard of trade paper clippings and ads, herbal samples, reference books, color charts
, fifty, slight, waves hello as  locks the door
Gay, hip, worn, he's John's "co-runner
" They work -- and eat -- out of Ann's apartment
Take-out tins of Indian food are stacked amid crystals, tarot cards, glasses, and vitamin bottles
No sign of drugs, drug paraphernalia, or money
Darling
Ann
Have we made New York safe for another weekend
(waves) Robert
Get a job
(about ) Sad what ten years without sex can do
Repartee: the plumbing of family feeling
unzips his belt pouch, walks toward the bedroom to deposit the night's earnings
Any hundreds
Twenties -- and tens
Tens
Goddamn cash machines
Did what's-his-name give you a hard time
(out of shot) You mean --
Yeah
Cash Before Delivery
(re-emerges) Fucking investment bankers
These Wall Street kids deal with fake money all day, they think cash is a theoretical concept -- like it doesn't apply
see 'em at two, shudder to think at nine they're buying and selling -- turned me off the stock market
It's late
(to ) You staying
It's over
'm gonna crash -- try, at least
(to ) Tomorrow will be easier
Maybe we can all eat together
Go on
You look tired
Here, take a couple of 's
'll pick up anything that comes in
turns to leave
Sleep tight
Pick up the trash
(laughs) Yeah -- big kiss
He throws two kisses, exits
: ' First light reflects across the Hudson as  walks west on 22nd Street toward his Chelsea apartment building delivery truck passes uncollected garbage
He enters a nondescript doorway
Inside his studio apartment,  sits at a second-hand table writing in a composition book
He drinks from an eight-ounce glass of white wine, continues
The room has little personality; Ann's apartment has enough for two
Nails indicate where pictures once hung; a boombox sits on the linoleum floor amid cassettes, books (Autobiography of a Yogi, The Secret Doctrine), fashion magazines, a stack of unopened CDs
futon is unrolled beneath the room's sole decoration, a poster of a human foot advertising a forgotten photo exhibit
Wine bottles -- Chenin Blanc
Precious little to show for forty years
LeTour's narration resumes as he writes: (voice over) "Labor Day
" "Union Movement" -- there's a contradiction in terms know about long hours
It's worse when 'm off --  just walk and walk
Where am  going
There's an element of providence to it all
Like rolling numbers
Luck
You're walking down the street, some guy that looks maybe a little like you does a stick-up four hours ago, there's an description out and a cop pulls you in cause he's cold and wants to go inside -- they grab your stash
Your number's up
You're busted for nothing
For bad luck

Clinton transient hotel
Inside hotel room,  meets with , a twenty-five- year-old drug intermediary in leather jacket
counts hundred-dollar bills, hands them to
Are they "faced"
Don't bore me
rearranges the hundreds: Is it so much work to face them the same direction
You don't do it, got to
It's time -- my time -- (overlap) Jees -- We've been through all this
( shrugs) This nineteen-gram shit is a drag
We pay you more, you put up with more
White drugs for white people
Twice the price, twice the safety
can't believe Ann's been working as long as she has -- never busted
She's something
Never made any big money either
Sure
She blows it
You believe that
What you gonna do after she quits
How long you been with her
She always says that
We'll see, Jealous
She's out
You should pick up her trade
You're too old to be a go- fer
They know you, they trust you
No way
'm not the management type
get in charge, 'll start using again -- not for me
know music people
'm gonna get in recording
Yeah
reaches for the door
Tour
What
Normally this wouldn't matter to you, but you may get hassled
Why
You read the papers
The Park murder
All over the Post
Mariah Rangel -- nineteen-year-old Barnard co-ed bitch dead in Turtle Pond coked to the fucking gills
All of a sudden they're hot after mid-level dealers
They're buzzin'
You know her
(shrugs) look like an encyclopedia
Who knows
(opens door) Thanks for the warning
: Ann's apartment
Eight p
m
She opens the door for , kisses him, goes back to the phone
Mantra muzak plays as locks door, heads toward bedroom
Inside bedroom, glows silently as , wearing a black turtleneck, works at a desk amid tools of the trade: digital scale, "hot box," Deering grinder, block of manite, pure cocaine, pills, felt pen
scissors glossy magazine paper (Elle) into neat quarters, folds each into gram-size "bindels" -- envelopes
Red satin drapes the ceiling
Jack
kisses him atop the head
You pick up from Jealous
(passes bag) Yeah, nineteen grams after four times last night
We're certainly not his favorite people
We don't make the laws
Nineteen is carrying, twenty is dealing
Let him be stupid
He took my hundreds
(stands) Take over for a while
'm getting contact high
(sits) Who's Her Majesty talking to
flips through cable channels as  grinds cocaine
The Ecstasy connection
From Arizona
She's trying to get them to come here -- or, better, Europe
That's where the money is
All mark-up -- the "Big One
" (laughs) Don't dress
(beat) You really think she means it
That's what she says
New Year's Eve and out -- no Acid House, no product, no deliveries
That's just her mouth talking
Next year -- strictly Akasha
"Akasha"
Cosmetics
That's what Ann's calling the company now -- (interjects) -- this week
don't get it -- marigolds, violets, sage -- why'd anyone pay to put weeds on their face
Why'd anyone pay to put them up their nose
like cosmetics
need cosmetics
You should come in with us
You forget: she hasn't asked me
hangs up, calls: (out of shot) Johnny
Robert
Come here
They return to the living area
(open arms) Plant me two kisses, boys, fifteen hundred Ex at thirty each and the delivery's here
They simultaneously kiss her cheeks
(to ) Whatja think
Of what
The face cream
Almond, marigold, chamomile, egg, aloe -- the "Almilk" formula
remixed it
(smells her) Very nice
Reminds me, if you get downtown stop at Enhancements and pick up some almond oil -- not the California
(fishes menus from desk) What should we order
How about Indian
Darling, it's Saturday
Thai
We haven't had Thai in a while
The phone rings
Ann's voice repeats a recorded message: ' "Hello
This is Ann
If you leave a message, we'll get back to you -- sooner than you think
" Answering machine beeps
'  speaks from the tiny speaker: "Ann, this is Ed
Call me
749-2876
" (to ) Answer that
He'll call back every five minutes
(walking) The night begins
The phone rings again: another message as  examines the menu
"Ped Srilom"
-- it's Northeastern
Duck
(glancing) 'm going veggie
Get me the "Puk Ob
" (out of shot from phone) Me too
Use it for facial cream
(out of shot) Remove unsightly hair
Laugh, one day you'll be watching me on "Oprah" from a welfare hotel
Forgive us
(returns) Eddie wants now
Now
His place
Top Lady
God knows what happened to his shit yesterday
(to ) You take it -- call in
It was supposed to be light tonight
Don't you watch
Don't have one
Well if you were the normal stupid fuck you should be so lucky to be and had one, you'd know it's supposed to rain -- Good for the trees -- Some farmer whacked his numerology on us
(peers through curtain) It's started
The Farmer's Almanac is based on numerology
Raining
Take a coat
(to ) And you, clean up the product before the food delivery comes
grabs his belt pouch, heads for the closet
: Rain falls on LeTour's car near an East Side luxury high- rise
The door opens to Eddie's apartment: severe decor, once chic, now dated
, thirty-two, is a mess: puffy face, sweaty shirt, pinched lips -- on a drug jag
Le Tour
-- finally
What took so long
(steps inside) Traffic
It's raining
How's things
Okay
need a quarter -- you got it
(nods) Robert said he sold you a quarter yesterday
(slurs) Some friends came over
How much is that
Fourteen-hundred
nods as , employing diminished skills, counts from a roll of twenties
looks around: full ashtrays, porn tapes, empty vodka bottles -- there have been no "friends
" Eddie
Look at yourself
Sit down
've known you, what, like eight years
(counting) Yeah
Knew you from the other job, the one before the last one you fucked up knew your wife -- remember her
We used to sit and talk and talk -- Pressures  into chair
(whining) You don't know what she was like -- This is no good
'll sell you a gram and some downs, but  ain't gonna put you in the emergency room
Cool it
Go to bed
Sleep it off
John's beeper goes off
(stands) You charge $200 for what goes for ninety on the street -- and you're not gonna sell
(clicks beeper) So go to the street
'll call Ann
Go ahead
You know what she'll say
Phone's over there
(irrational) 'll tell the fucking cops
(flashes cold) Fuck you
That's it
You're out
(turns to leave) Don't call again
Catch you next lifetime
(contrite) Please, Tour, 'm sorry
You're right
didn't mean that
'm quitting anyway
'll take the gram
Sorry
(turns back) Okay
Two hundred
nods
counts $200 as  takes a gram from his pouch, gives it to him
You got downs
( nods) One more thing
gotta use the phone
pockets the envelope as , checking his beeper, walks to the phone
Later
sits in an Upper West Side apartment as an earnest - , wearing undershorts, snorts a hefty line, offers a rolled dollar bill as he talks declines
- (continuing) but -- if there's no God, how can man conceive of him
The idea of God presupposes the existence of God
That's the Ontological Argument
Anselm
Twelve hundred
Fourteen hundred -- 'm not sure -- (checks his watch) 've got to go
- (gesturing) Let me finish
Okay, if the idea of God is implanted by God -- the sensus divinitatus, the sense of the divine -- what is the role of human thought
Not faith, thought
's mind drifts
His diary voice overlaps: (Voice over) Everybody wants to talk
It's like a compulsion
My philosophy is: you got nothing to say, don't say it
They figure you can tell a
anything, things they would never tell anyone else
He understands
Of course they're stoned to start
If could tie together all the hours of coke talk 've heard, that would be a lot of string
It was Robert's idea to add twenty-five dollars to home deliveries cause it's such a hassle
Fifty is more like it
Later
Narration continues as sedan drives through rain
Later
Tribeca loft
swaps drug jargon with at an impromptu party
Attractive ingenues drift by
, blasted, sways, to techno-rap
Business done,  turns to leave
The   grabs his shoulder: 'mon, Tour, stick around
Yeah
There's only four of us and like seven of them -- and we're paying for the dope
See her, over there, the blonde, long hair, yellow skirt
-- she's gonna model for Elite
, sixteen going on seventeen
(smiling) Me
'm an old man
She'd break me like an old horse
Shit, dude -- Nah
Thanks anyway
(checks watch) gotta go
Have fun
(heads toward exit) : LeTour's sedan heads down Lexington Avenue
It rains unabated
Puddles glisten; red taillights refract on the windshield
rests in back, a bag from Enhancements beside him
Pedestrians, well-dressed and casual, desperately wave for taxis amid sacks of garbage
No use: nothing for blocks
John's sedan stops for a midtown light
looks out the window, sees a  vainly hailing a cab
He looks again
She turns her head
He recognizes her
(to ) Carlos
Wait a second
He leans over, opens the far door, calls: Marianne
Marianne
Hop in
'll give you a ride
, thirty-five, stylish in short black hair and long black coat, steps closer, looks through the rain
John
John LeTour
(recognizes him) John
Get in
You're getting soaked
She ducks inside, slams the door
(awkward) Hi
The car moves on
Where are you going
wipes rain from her cheeks; her expression deepens: cautious, suspicious
No reply
didn't know you still lived here
(second thoughts) Maybe this wasn't such a good idea
should get out
Don't be crazy
It's pouring
'm not supposed to be around -- (completes sentence) -- former drug associates
It's four years 'm clean
No alcohol, no cigarettes, no nothing
heard
'm happy for you
It's still not easy
know
Mar, you don't need to avoid me
'm straight -- two years
It came that time
tried to tell you
wrote
called
(looks around) should get out
Honest
But you're dealing
No
stopped
What's in the bag
Almond oil
You can check
(opens bag) Look
She does: Enhancements Almond Oil
John's beeper goes off
-- he punches it
Shit
What's that for
In case someone needs almond oil in the middle of the night
still deal a little, but 'm straight -- that part's true
Believe me
(to ) Stop here
Now
Stop
won't say anything
promise
'll just sit here
'll just give you a ride
The car pulls over
opens the door, gets out
Goodbye, John
Where do you live
(door slams) Mari
She fades into the rain
watches, aching
Sir
Eighty-third Street
The sedan continues uptown
: John's apartment
Pre-dawn
His diary lies open on the desk
sits clothed on the futon, drinking white wine
He pages through a cheap, half-filled photo album
He touches snapshots, 35's from another time: --  and , arm in arm, on a Florida beach -- , surprised by the camera, snorting coke at a party -- , , and  posing, smiling, same party --  and  kissing over birthday cake, same party -- --  blowing a kiss in Fez airport : LeTour's narration continues over embossed card on an entry table: Teresa Aronow, Psychic Reading, 37 Jones Street, New York,
10012, (212)473-4297
under narration: (out of shot) Coffee
(out of shot) Thanks
(out of shot) Black
(out of shot) Yeah
(out of shot) Here
accepts a coffee mug, sits on a sofa across from
Sunlight falls through crocheted curtains
, fortyish, professionally young, is compact, demure; she wears business jacket and skirt, patterned blouse
Nothing about her is remotely paranormal -- nothing except, of course, her "aura
" The "Other Side
" Her voice is at the same time soothing, piercing
Teresa's West Village consultation room is startlingly mundane: a bourgeois walk-up
Upholstered furniture, Tiffany objets d'art, framed photos of her husband and children -- a trip to Capri
twenties portrait of Madame Blavatsky, above the fireplace, centers the room
'm not sure how this works
Have you ever been to a psychic before
No, but 've, well, 've heard about it
Do you need advice
John
(nods) No
it's not that
don't know -- just decided to come
thought
Be comfortable
(smile) How did you hear about me
recommendation
Somebody from work
Two hundred dollars, right
nods
tucks cash into an envelope, places it on the coffee table
It's a lot of money
don't care
(explaining) look at you
give you my impressions
feel your "vibrations" -- don't like that word, it sounds phony, but  can't think of anything better
(watching) You're anxious
(he shrugs) More than usual
Your aura is very strong
feel a very strong vibration from you
change is coming
You're worried about money
You say you don't care about money but that's not true
Yeah
Your livelihood is endangered
You're worried about the future
You don't have much money saved
What will you do
don't know
see a woman who has betrayed you
(smiles) My mother
(cuts him short) Who will betray you
Not
Keep it in mind
have a strong feeling about this woman, a woman close to you, she will betray you
You're in the entertainment business, aren't you
Yes
But you're not happy
You want to do something else
Is it music
Yes
You have a talent for music
As a child
You still have it
It's strong see music in your future
career opportunity will come in the music field
Take it
It won't seem promising
Take it anyway
(pause) You're full of stress
Are you exercising
No
-- You should exercise more
You must let go of this stress
It's not good for your health
'm not saying you're going over to the other side, but it's not good for you
You're still drinking, aren't you
You have a drinking problem
(he shrugs) It's interfering with your health and your life too
You've had other problems
Drug addiction
Yes
This was very important in your life
Yes
You are in the balance
Everything you do -- positive or negative -- in this life is a drop that will carry over in the next
Every act, every decision matters
Teresa
What is it
'm thirty-eight years old
(beat) Forty
You're young
have trouble sleeping
( waits) Look
What do you see around me
Is there anything
Is it dark
Have run out of luck
Is there luck
see a glow
Everything you need is around you
The only danger is inside you
: Ann's apartment
The night has already begun
sits on the floor beside a   counting money
He wears Orthodox garb: black hat, black coat, peyas
Tibetan bells reverb from speakers as the Bergmanesque cambist runs faced twenty-dollar bills through a battery-operated counting machine, places stacks of cash on the floor
returns a call from the kitchen;  emerges from the bathroom, wiping his hands
(to  and ) Your pay's on the table
walks to the cosmetics corner, finds an envelope with his name on it, looks inside: $500 in twenties
He pockets the money
sits as  double-checks the total: cash covers the available floor space
(dialogue punctuates action) One hundred thirty-one, let's make it 130-$13,000, hundreds for small bills
One percent commission, $130 to you -- add tens or whatever if you want
Opening a satchel, he removes bound $100s, counts off 130 as adds up commission in small bills
He loads the satchel: Same time
(nods) Two weeks -- don't run
Stay a while
We'll order kosher
We'll tell you dirty stories
We'll talk Zionism
The  laughs
He likes her
(passes hundreds) 'm late already
only come 'cause like you
Sure you're not Jewish
don't want to see you hurt
Find a man
You should do something else
(offers commission) Invest in my cosmetics line
(takes money) Don't mix business with friendship
follows him to the door
Shalom
Shalom
(opens door) See you next week
(calls after him) Don't eat any hot dogs
closes door
Jealous said something about a yuppie murder in the Park
You know anything about it
It's all over the news
Jealous said to be careful
We are careful
(returning) We're too small time
Besides, she wasn't one of ours -- not directly
(to ) Tis is at St
Luke's
He wants somebody over right away
Second floor waiting room
hospital
What's he doing there
He says he needs you to come to St
Luke's
'd go but  got the other thing
The --
Yeah
(to ) Go
Keep on his good side
He set up Arizona
Phone rings; Ann's machine answers: "Hello, this is Ann

Tomorrow

Cote Basque
Is that too early
No
Yeah -- sure
Tonight

Fine
Okay
(heads for door) Mixed sushi
Oshitashi
: ' vehicles line street outside St
Luke's -- Roosevelt Hospital
Inside,  weaves through Emergency (eerie), double-steps the stairs, looks for the second floor waiting area
(Mathis -- pronounced Tees), thirty-five, Swiss, paces in the waiting room
He wears a linen jacket, horn-rim glasses, Cerrutti Euro-swank
He spots , takes him aside: What's going on
You got some valiums
(nods) -- 'n 'ludes
Just a valium -- a ten
What is it
You won't believe it
What a nightmare
brought in this chick
She
ed -- man,  didn't even know her
didn't have to bring her in
The cops are coming back to talk to me
'm hyper
gotta come down
(hands him valium) Here
Make it two
obliges
pops a blue without water, pockets the other
Thanks
She okay
Who
The girl
Yeah, yeah
Met her last night walking vacuum cleaner
What a nightmare
Underage
You need a lawyer
(gestures toward suited man) He's here
Thanks
folds a bill into John's hand
Any time
turns, steps away
walks down the long corridor
Curious, reflective, he slows past open doors
Friends, family, patients sit in blue light
Each room a drama
He heads down a duplicate corridor
turns his head: John
He turns to see  , thirty, Marianne's younger sister
She wears running shoes, jeans, red sweater
Randi
(kisses him) can't believe it
Marianne's here too
She flew in
It's been so long
You look great
(deactivates beeper) You too
Randi, what's wrong
Why are you here
Mom
She's back in
Didn't Marianne tell you
Serious
(nods) More chemo
Can  see her
She's sleeping
She sleeps most of the time
She'd like it, though
She still talks about you
(sad) 'm so sorry
She's a terrific woman
was crazy about her
God
, head down, approaches
Looking up, she finds herself unexpectedly beside  and : It's John
What a coincidence
(gathering herself) Yes
(extends hand) Hi
(shakes hand) Randi told me about your mom
'm sorry
Thanks
She's sedated
Yeah
She would be so happy to see John
don't think that would be a good idea
An awkward silence:  doesn't get it
You both look so tired
One of us has to be here
The hospital lets us stay in her room
Let me buy you some coffee or something -- the cafeteria's downstairs
It helps to talk
You go, Marianne, it's my turn with mom
shouldn't
Go
You haven't eaten
Go on
(nudges her) Go on
Bring me a coffee
acquiesces
This way
(to ) Kiss your mother for me
escorts  toward the stairs
: Hospital cafeteria
and  carry trays to a formica table, molded chairs
He mixes sugar in his coffee as she sets out her salad, diet soda, to-go coffee
An awkward moment
scans the fluorescent room: doctors, nurses, relatives
like your mom
She liked you
You know this will happen someday, but when it does
Your mother -- that was a shock
(re: Marianne's mother) She's been sick a while
year
Your father
("no") Not this time
His new wife -- he'll make it to the funeral
What have you been doing
Where do you live
It's
(deciding) don't want you to know about my life
Anything
You married
Have children
dog
(smile) House plants
Details just open the door
The door to what
(no answer) It's not like we're strangers
We were married
We were not
There was a ceremony
He wasn't even a minister
He was an astrologer
He was also a minister
"Universal Harmony
" He was a Pisces
You're a Pisces
It was not legal
In the eyes of Jeanne Dixon we're still -- was on the cusp
We were happy
We were miserable
We were either scoring or coming down -- mostly coming down
There were good times
Area, out on the street, laughing, dancing with friends -- we were magical
You took off for three months without telling me and called once
That's how magical we were
You were an encyclopedia of suicidal fantasies -- heard them all
Nobody could clear a room like you, John
And the friends, you may have noticed, turned out to be mine, not yours
envy you
convenient memory is a gift from God
You exaggerate
In rehab they call this "euphoric recall
" You only remember the highs, never the lows
We were happy
was drowning
It wasn't me -- You watched -- You jumped -- You did nothing -- "It wasn't your business, you weren't responsible" -- you still think like that
(shakes head) Actions have consequences; so do -- (overlap) -- -- inactions
didn't -- ( smiles) meant well
You always meant well
We were in love
Yes
We were happy
She doesn't answer
He slides his hand across the table
She notices his gold and onyx ring
You bought it for me
It's inscribed inside
She pushes his hand away
Details open doors
Ann's quitting
've got to find something else to do
Ann
'll believe it when  see it
It's true
Are you really straight
Yeah
Let me see your eyes
leans forward, eyes open
She presses up an eyelid, examines one iris, the other: Eyes are deceiving
(beat) Congratulations
If  could do that,  could do anything
What do you mean
We could do anything
We could start over
(bangs her head) What was that
think  heard something
'm serious
An   announces visiting hours will end in five minutes
You're crazy
(gestures to room) This is crazy
have to get back
nods, checks his watch -- he's late too
They exchange "last looks";  stands
'll walk you
He stands, follows
: Later
LeTour's sedan pulls up near Palio, a midtown restaurant
steps around garbage bags, enters
Inside,  "maps" bar, greets the  '
spots the  (LaCroix and Montana)  in the dining section, catches the man's eye
He nods to the  ', makes his way toward their table
He joins the  , declines a drink, exchanges drugs/money amid air kisses
Late night
Fog hangs over 22nd Street: Chelsea's deserted
Homeless men behind windbreaks of trash
John's apartment
He writes bareback at the desk
He completes his composition book diary mid-sentence, closes it, discards it
He lifts a new book from the floor, opens it on the desk, continues
He fills his glass with wine: (voice over) can always find another way to make a living
never planned this in the first place -- not like Ann
She came up to sell, have parties, make contacts
She was so glamorous

She'd sit up listening to coke stories
Now it's me and Robert

Everybody's younger now

He addresses the envelope

The  stops by, asks if the meal was satisfactory assures him it was, kisses his hand
The  nods, gratified
resumes the conversation: don't know
It's not that much in the first place -- as you know
(counterpoint) It's tax free -- Rent, utilities, phone, tips, CDs -- what about your money
Kitty Ford once told me, "Ann, the only person  know that lives as well as you is my grandmother
" All the money 've made, all the money 've spent -- it never adds up
This last two years cosmetics' been taking everything
wish  could help
You still go to meetings
No, but 'm okay
What are the odds of meeting someone you haven't seen in years twice in two days
Ask Robert to make up a chart for you; the other person -- who is it
Just a contact -- you don't know him
What's the plan
The plan
What you gonna do
My future
Too conceptual
We had this conversation two years ago
We'll have it two years from now
This time it's for real

That was acting

Why all this concern
Suddenly you care

She watches: (about ) Nomination for Best Picture

Like this

Old money remember the last thing he said to me: "See you soon

Flowers wreathe the bed

He soundlessly eases into a vacant chair
His mind goes back
twists fitfully in her chair

steps into the doorway, stops, frozen -- watching the tableau: , , her mother
Her face is ravaged: the death watch has taken its toll
reaches his arm, touches the hospital bed
tiptoes behind
He turns, stands
(soft) 'm sorry
She puts her finger to her lips
He nods
She steps closer, holds him politely
His cheek nestles in her neck
They turn toward the door, step into the corridor, walk arm in arm as if supporting each other
(after a moment) always thought my father would die first
He would die, then my mother and  would reconcile
Just her and me
hated him for living
It's like a joke
It's not a real feeling
It's like a feeling of a feeling
My old man bawling in the hospital, me popping in and out of the john getting loaded
(beat) miss you
They stop
She kisses him
You tried to kill me
You took ten years of my life one way or another
(he kisses her) couldn't hate my mom --  was too busy hating you
thought  was just killing myself
She runs her hands under his shirt, up his back
Selfish
remember
What
What it felt like
(kisses his face) What this tasted like
He slips his hands under her blouse, caresses her breasts
see you and my heart starts thumping

Not with you
Neither have
Such an erection
Never had anything like it stoned
Feel it

They smack their sweaty bodies, tumble yelping to the carpet, kiss indiscriminately: Kiss, kiss, kiss
Kiss, kiss, kiss
Together
Later: night
They lie nude in a scramble of twisted sheets and mattresses
Street lights cast horizontal shadows crawls over, falls upon Marianne's breast
She wakes up, looks at , looks out the window, returns to slow sad reality
stands, pulls on her panties
(waking) You need to go back
She dresses before responding: This is the end
It was wonderful

It will never happen again
You will not see me, you will not call me again

Never used one like this

The  laughs;  takes his measure
(businesslike) What do you do
Simple
You put the bullets in -- (inserts cartridge) you point it at the bad guys, pull the trigger and they fall down

, sweating, bareback, tucks the
38 under his futon
He takes a bottle of cologne from the bathroom, pours it over his hair, face, and torso, rubs it in
Licking his finger, he removes Marianne's gold and onyx ring with a tug
His finger stings
He opens a window, throws the ring full force into the junk-strewn courtyard
He shakes his torso; cologne glistens

enters the "viewing room," motions to
She follows him
They slip into a door, enter the embalming room: stainless steel table surrounded by surgical cabinets
They embrace, disengage
looks: Randi's exhausted face mirrors his
Have you been to the police station
(nods) She was back on drugs
Really back
They're gonna bring her here too
My God
(he comforts her) thought she was playing for attention
didn't know
You're not to blame
Don't blame yourself
You weren't responsible
She was always -- she loved you
(wipes tear from her cheek) She loved you
You were what she wanted to be
She scared me
pulls a Polaroid from his pocket
Look
Do you recognize anyone
The picture features  and : side by side at a dinner party
Tis
You know him
His father's a lawyer
Did some tax things for Mom
He was at the hospital
What's that smell
It's me
Cologne
'm a sucker for that cheap airplane stuff
Did Marianne mention him yesterday
("no") It was his apartment
What are you thinking
don't know
She jumped
( hangs on every word) You loved her, but she -- this sounds terrible but it's true -- she was
she ruined everything
bad luck
(heard enough) When's the funeral -- your mother's
Tomorrow
Will you come
(vague) Well,  got this thing to do
It's -- don't know if  can get away
Try
For me
'll try

The Prodigal Son
Sorry about last night
Something came up
Where were you
"Too Complicated To Explain
" (enters bedroom) 'm $500 short from last night
'll get it, you can take it from my salary
(stung) This is family
Are you saying that to hurt me
( returns) It's not money
(chagrined) Sorry
Look at this
("Akasha" visual) We had a graphic artist make it up -- you know, Billy, Five Towns
The label for the cosmetics line
(examines it) Classy
Sorta -- Katmandu
(corrects him) Kathmandu
love it
Tis called twice
He wants you to come by
(wary) Me
Yeah
Says you were supposed to show up again yesterday, but didn't
lie
don't want to go
The suicide and all
Let's stay away
Can't
He's the Ecstasy connect
No way  can fuck this
'mon
This is business
, suspicious, looks from  to
He knows knows he knows  was not alone when she went out the window
Let Robert go
Tis won't deal with fags
Since when
Just is -- so he's a bigot
What's new
So's everybody else
don't want to go
got a bad vibe
He said you
(to ) Why
(to ) Why don't you go
He's your contact
He is -- (to ) You giving orders
(deferential) No, Missy
(testing her) Come with me -- the two of us
(upbeat) Okay
You got it
Like old times -- Ann and Johnny
(turns to go) Okay
Stop it
You're breaking my heart
: Night
and  side by side in the sedan
, at the wheel, anonymous
Outside,   toss sacks of trash into garbage trucks: the strike is over
reminisces as lights flash: It's going to be strange, not doing this
mean 've had it, but sometimes
You're gonna do it, aren't you
You're gonna quit
(nods) think so
Seal this thing with Tis, turn it -- go with the cosmetics
You gotta take a chance in life
No risk, no gain
've already got retail connections here, London
It was great at the beginning, though
When
You know, when we first started out of the place on Greene Street
Before deliveries, when you were still using
It was open house every night but Sunday
We had everything: uppers, downers, meth, six kinds of hash, all in that trousseau, remember
You could get in for a gram, stay all night -- everybody, music people, movies, Wall Street, fashion -- even politics
think like five marriages came out of those parties, babies -- really
God
( eyes her: why this Niagara, this nostalgia
) You stayed, you then Robert -- but he
'da never thought you'd, what is it, twelve years
Others, lucky a year max, eight months, in, out, start using, unreliable -- nice kids
Remember when you first came: long hair, dirty fingers -- (overlapping) You made me -- -- never washed -- -- khaki pants
should write a book someday
Did you know somebody wanted to do my story
Ghostwrite
It was impossible, of course -- my lawyer freaked even had the meeting
People envy me
They think my life is so glamorous, but they don't know know
Glamorous
(beat) It was for a while
Then came crack and fucked everything
wonders: The Big Goodbye
Is she acting at Tis' behest
gotta stop home a second
Why
It's out of the way
They're expecting you
"They're
" You know  got a bad vibe about Tis
(unconvincing) Chill
This is routine
want to get my lucky jacket
Oh
Okay
The sedan continues south
It turns, stops in front of John's Chelsea apartment building
hops out, goes in
Inside John's apartment he -- a man possessed -- pulls his black tweed from the closet, throws it on the futon
He rolls up his shirt, reaches under the futon, removes the
38
He straps the gun to his back, wraps duct tape around his chest, end to end over the
38
He tucks in his shirt, puts on the jacket, checks the mirror to see if the gun shows: it doesn't
pause to appreciate
closes his diary, throws it out the window: a trifle
He slaps cologne on his cheeks -- annointing; heads toward the door
Outside,  emerges, walks quickly to the car, plops beside
The sedan drives off
Back seat: That took long enough
What did you do, douche while you were at it
Ann, you got some mouth on you
You don't want to know where it's been
(sniffs him) Cologne
For you
Phew
It smells like that stuff they give you on airplanes
It's no good for your skin
All chemicals
pulls out a slip of paper, writes a name and address: "Linda Wichel, 1012B-2  Street, Sacramento, California
" What's that
Do me a favor
What
Don't ask why, just promise
What is it
(testing again) If anything happens to me -- if should like, you know, fucking die -- write and tell her
Extends slip of paper
starts to speak, stops
It's my sister
Her husband's in San Quentin
She worries, you know
She takes the name and address
(eye contact) Okay
, sad, looks out the window
She touches his knee
The car pulls in front of the Pennsylvania Hotel, 34th and 7th
thought we were going to Tis'
We are
He's here
He can't very well work out of his apartment after what happened yesterday, can he
They get out
: - Pennsylvania lobby: a baseball card convention is in progress
squeezes through, goes to the house phone
follows, scans the tacky lobby: what's up
(on phone) Mathis Bruge, please
(beat) Tis
Ann
'm here with Tour
(beat) Okay
(hangs up) Tis there
Twelve-oh-four
They go to the elevators, wait with [Pete Rose this, Pete Rose that]
Twelfth floor
and  step out of the elevator, look for 1204
, a step behind, is all eyes, all ears
checks the number, rings the bell
lets them in the standard issue suite, locks the door
was right: it's a set-up
and a stand either side of them, waistbands conspicuously bulging
No
turns to : (Jesus-to-Judas) Ann
's confused, then furious: she had no part in the "set- up
" In fact, she doesn't even know it's a set-up
Bursting rage, she turns on , : told you greasy fucks  don't deal with guns
see guns,  walk
How dare you
She slaps , pulls the 9mm from his waistband, throws it to the carpet
The  watches bewildered, gun drawn, awaiting instructions
Now 's on him: And you, beaner, whoever the fuck you are, kiss my fat ass
(she spits on his shirt, knees him in the crotch, yanks his gun, throws it beside the gut- clutching
She crosses the room, :) That's it
Shitball
know you're fucking there
Let this be a lesson
You wanna deal, you gonna apologize for this
(to ) Let's go
and the   retrieve their guns;  unlocks the door
(pointing gun) Hold it
Stop right there
She turns defiantly
enters from bedroom: (to ) No
(to ) Sorry about the guns
My fuck-up was just trying to make a point -- apologize
looks to  and the : they lower their weapons
He only means to threaten
(about  and ) Assholes
What a nightmare
(to ) We'll make the deal tomorrow -- same terms
Ann
Sorry
Go on, leave, you're upset
just need to talk to Tour a second
About a police matter
(to ) Right
(to ) Go on
She hesitates
Tour and  need to get our stories straight
Somebody's talking to the police
The guns were for emphasis, to make a point, dumb -- gets it
Fear hits: (to ) We came together, we're leaving together
(to ) Johnny, come with me
Opens door
(a command) Thomas
fixes his gun on
(to ) Don't be stupid
Get out
Leave
(to ) had nothing to do with Marianne -- she jumped: she was there, then she was gone
(nods  to leave) Nothing will happen to Tour
computes, bolts out, flees,  at the top of her lungs: (out of shot) Fire
Fire
Fire
The fire bell rings
, , and the  stare dumbfounded
reaches behind his shirt in the confusion, yanks out the
38 with a painful rip, turning, fires point-blank into the Cuban's chest
Shirt fabric flares, flies: the falls with blank expression
, off guard, wheels and fires wildly at
fires back
Both are hit
ducks into the bedroom
and  fire again, again -- hitting, missing bullet hits its mark: , frozen, grabs his blood-spurting throat, slumps to floor
bleeds from the stomach and shoulder
His shirt soaks red; he struggles to stand
and  -- both dead
checks the
38: five rounds fired -- one left
staggers into the bedroom, finds  frantically searching an open suitcase
Off-screen  under the fire bell
(desperate) didn't -- steps to , aims, shoots him barrel to forehead
Exit debris hits the wall
He is dead
Off-screen screams of guests are countered by commands from hotel security: "Get down
" "Get back
" Fire horns and sirens reverb from the street
, losing consciousness, sits bedside
Gun slips from his hand
Deflating, he drifts back-first to the bedspread
Blood spreads
His eyes are open
approach
: Prison waiting area
, wearing a wool suit, waits among black/Hispanic  and
The first scene without : she sits quietly
instructs the visitors to proceed
walks through a concrete corridor, finds the visiting area
, in prison fatigues, sits at a table
He sees her, smiles
sits down
This is not her first visit
Hello
Hi
Checks watch
Twenty minutes
You look terrific
look respectable
Any news
Sentencing's in ten days -- supposed to be
Because of the extenuating circumstances -- our cooperation -- they say it won't be more than five years -- maybe seven
With time served, good behavior, parole, could be out in two years -- maybe
hope
It feels like forever
It's not so bad
It's a relief in a way -- at least so far
've been writing, reading
love your letters
(pause) How's business
Robert quit
He went back to dealing
think he thought it would be less work, more money
It's lucky in a way  got mixed up in it -- now have to see this thing through
So it's cosmetics after all
(affectionate) miss you
Me too
Did we ever fuck
What do you mean
You know, make love
(thinks) There was that party when everybody was so stoned, but -- oh yeah, that night you came over and crashed and we slept together
We were naked, but did we --
You had a hard-on
didn't -- You tried
was thinking about it and  realized we never really did
It's one of the things  think about
It's one of the things  look forward to
've been looking forward
Me too
(touches her hand) Something can be right in front of you and you can't see it
(kisses his hand) Strange how things work
The tableau fades
