Written by Ring Lardner Jr
and Terry Southern Based on a novel by Richard Jessup - 1965 :     - Exterior scenes of St
Louis, particularly the riverside industrial district
Even more important to establish than the place is the time: end of summer, 1936
Election posters would help, with the Republican ones stressing such themes as "Burst the Roosevelt Bubble," "Save the American Way of Life," "Vote for Landon and Knox
" - One of the most typical scenes of the day: a mass picket line outside a textile or shoe factory
And the picketing is anything but peaceful; the demonstrators are in direct conflict with the police, who are trying to keep an entrance open for strike-breakers
Whatever the general action, a small segment of struggle breaks off from it, and it is this that our  picks up: some police chasing some pickets or some pickets chasing some strike-breakers, the one faction pursuing the other up an alley with violent intent
- couple of the pursuers catch up to the pursued and assault them with clubs or other weapons
The fighting is bitter, dirty and noisy
The eight men gathered here in a game of five-card stud are clearly removed from the struggle outside, even though the of it are very close, coming through window opening on the alley
In fact the noise is so loud that the of the hand in progress reacts in annoyance
Somebody shut the goddam window
Let a man think
The player nearest the window shuts it
The Dealer, who also owns the restaurant, is the talkative type of poker player
Except for   , the other men at the table look like hoods of one sort or another: gunmen, labor spies, extortionists, what have you
The man who fancies himself the toughest of them all is named , and he and The Kid have almost all the money on the table between them, about a hundred dollars in front of each
No other player has more than a few dollars left, and now, as fifth cards are dealt, there is about forty dollars in the pot
Only four men are left in the hand
Possible straight gets a -- (deals the card) -- lovely little four
On the last hand even, you couldn't give me a break
put the brakes on your straight, didn't
(he laughs; no one else does; he deals to The Kid) There you are, son, a gorgeous deuce
Thanks
(deals to Danny) And our lucky friend from Chicago gets a queen with his pair of sixes
Little lady make you happy, Buster
Deal to yourself, clown
Dealer gives himself a -- (deals card and groans) might have known
(to Danny) Bet your sixes, Buster
told you not to call me that
(then as the dealer turns away) Cost you -- (counts out his money) Ninety-four bucks
Biggest pot of the whole game,  got to drop
(to First Player) Interested
Wouldn't call you if  had a pair higher'n sixes
Which  ain't
He turns over his cards, leaving it up to The Kid
Don't seem like he'd bet out without something better than the sixes, does it
(fingers hole card as if to fold) Cost me every cent 've won since yesterday afternoon
(studies Danny's face) But  tell you,  got this stubborn streak
Call the ninety-four dollars
He counts out the money, which is almost all he has
(indignantly) You can't have better than a pair of kings
Oh, 'm not claiming anything that fine
(turns over an eight, making a pair of them) Just enough to beat the pair of sixes
You seen my hole card, you bastard
(indicating Dealer) He was dealing them high
Attending to first things first, The Kid has been pulling in the pot, adding it to his own stake, and pocketing the total
Now as Danny accuses him again, The Kid looks him squarely in the face
You stole that dough
You better watch those loose lips of yours, you want to have any teeth left behind them -- Buster
He stands up
You wouldn't of shelled out ninety- four bucks -- called you on account of  didn't think you had another pair or another six and  know a punk like you would get greedy and try and buy the last hand
He walks off, disappearing through a door marked "
" '  - He is waiting when the door opens abruptly, and Danny appears, his right hand in his coat pocket
The Kid's hand goes to his own pocket and as he whirls around, a straight razor appears in it, its blade snapped open
Pushing Danny to the wall with one hand, he keeps him pinned there with the razor in the other, while he bolts the door
Danny gets his right hand out of the pocket with a gun in it, but The Kid moves the razor blade against his neck
Drop it
As the gun clatters to the floor, and the others force the door, The Kid takes a step backward to provide enough momentum, then swings at Danny's middle with his left, dropping him, then jumps up on the wash basin and wriggles his way out through a window
: Danny recovers his balance and his gun, unbolts the door just before it is smashed in, and runs with the others to get out of the building and after The Kid
- The conflicting parties from the picket lines have moved on
The Kid drops from the window to the ground and starts to run toward the railroad yards
few moments later, Danny and four other poker players appear and run after him
- The chase across the tracks goes on behind the Credits
The Kid's pursuers split into two groups to cut him off, and they seem to have succeeded in cornering him against a track on which a passenger train is bearing down, headed for the station
His dubious chance of escape depends on his getting beyond this track in front of the train, which, with a burst of speed, he manages to accomplish just in time
The passenger train divides The Kid from his pursuers, and we  with the train into the depot
, The train slowly stops
Amid all the atmosphere of arrival in a day when the Pullman car was still the ultimate in travel,   appears on a platform, takes his bag from the Pullman porter and passes it on to a Red Cap before he has descended the steps
He walks with other passengers and Red Caps toward the center of the station
- Shooting through the Meeting of the Rivers fountain across Market Street to the Romanesque building with its campanile
-   - Lancey getting into a taxi
-  - Lancey sits in serene repose in back, watching the sights go by
The  steals a couple of looks at him in the rear vision mirror
What you looking for, mister
Do  have to be looking for something
can pretty much tell
You can pretty much tell what
Some guys come to town,  can tell if they're looking for something
What do you think 'm looking for
If you're looking for girls,  can fix you up
strongly doubt if you could fix me up
In that department
Well what are you looking for
You're looking for a clout in the head if you don't keep your face to the road
-   - doorman takes Lancey's suitcase as Lancey pays the Hackie and walks into the hotel
whose cab is at the curb reacts to seeing Lancey and steps forward
Hey, you know who that is
No
Who
But the second hackie has followed Lancey into the hotel
Lancey crosses to the desk to register as the Second Hackie goes to a row of phone booths and enters one
He dials with his eyes on Lancey registering
(into phone) Shorty
Want to hear who just checked into the Park Sherman
Yes, you do
Lancey Hodges
- He is talking on the phone while he hands out score sheets and shoes to some bowlers
He is just as excited by the report as the Hackie is
The Kid know
- He is talking on the telephone behind the bar
Somebody sure as hell ought to tell The Kid
(hangs up) Lancey Hodges is in town
-   - He reacts to the news in a big way
to another , who is equally impressed
They exchange looks
Kid's been laying for him a long time
- You ask me, The Kid'll go after him as soon as he hears
Who's got a better right
'   - We are in the front room where the pool tables are
Through an open door in b
g
, we can see the unadvertised but unconcealed other activity of the establishment: a poker game in progress
You going to tell The Kid, Shooter
Hell,  can't not tell him
It's where he's been headed for years
The Kid enters the place through the front door, still a little dishevelled from his escape
(in greeting) Hey
What you say, Kid
Hey, Hoban
Where you been
Boys been holding a chair for you in back
Business opportunity come along
Something too good to pass up
Turn a profit
Yeah, did okay
Except  almost had it took back
Oh, one of those
(concerned) You been in too many rough ones lately, Kid
You can't go on forever, coming out in one piece
got to build my stake, Aren't enough chances in this town to let one go
You're too good, that's your trouble
People who know you're the Cincinnati Kid, they don't want to sit down with you -- For nickels and dimes
Thing is 've about used up St
Louis
(nodding) The streets are getting full of guys you've hustled
Been thinking about Miami
There's nothing to keep me here
(after a moment) The hell there isn't (as the Kid looks at him) Lancey Hodges' in town
Yeah
(then) The Man himself, here in St
Louis -- might just stick around Shooter
' Lancey is on the phone, sitting on the bed
(into phone) Mr
Schlaegel
How are you
And your enchanting wife
Tomorrow is quite convenient
generally prefer stud but you name it
Your stakes are my pleasure, sir
Thank you, why don't we make it after lunch
My diet these days is enough to spoil anyone else's appetite
pleasure, sir
Please remember me to your charming wife
He hangs up and some of the strength seems to go out of him, as if he had been through too long a sustained effort
His eyes show that he is feeling pain and he breathes deeply
- Harold Street leads to the river and we follow The Kid and The Shooter as they walk down it in the gathering dusk
(lighting a cigar) been seeing it coming for a long time, Kid
Long time
ain't exactly been hiding it
No, you ain't been hiding it
Well  got to know
Sure, you got to know
We all got to know
Sometime or other we got to find out how much juice we got
That's why  had to tell you
You ever sit down with him
Yes,  have
They walk along, The Shooter pursing his lips thoughtfully
Well, what happened
Nothing
Nothing at all
You lost
didn't lose
'm too good to lose when  set my mind to it
play poker a certain way, Kid
've had my Lancey Hodges
Only with me it was Whistling Sam Magee to New Orleans
(respectfully) heard about him
Well then you know it all
about 20 years ago it was, maybe more
What happened
Why,  lost it
It dried me up on the inside for a long, a very long time
Yeah
been where 'm going, know what mean
The Kid nods as they come to where an old wooden pier extends into the river
Along the river bank can be seen a small portion of the mile-long Hooverville that stretches up and down the Mississippi
They walk out on the pier and eventually stop, look out at the river, watching the working boats
They have their thoughts; The Shooter smoking his cigar
You think 'm ready
(after some time, several seconds of thoughtful puffing) Kid,  don't think you're ready
(quickly) Oh
But you're not going to take my word for it, are you
Are you now
No,  ain't
can't
know,  know
You got to find out for yourself
don't figure to take him right away
But if  can hang in there long enough,  can outlast him
If can outlast him,  got a chance
You admit that, don't you, that  got a chance
already said  didn't think you were ready
Did you think you were ready when you sat down with Whistling Sam Magee
Kid,  thought  was the best stud poker player in the world
'm telling you now,  thought  was the best
Well,  don't think 'm just a cocky square with a fair hand with cards
got something
No, you ain't no cocky square
And you probably got something
Okay
And  ain't saying that you was either when you sat down with Whistling Sam Magee
If you got the stuff, being a little cocky don't hurt you none
Well, would you say if  got any chance at all
This much of a chance
If Lancey is not right
If he's got a cold, or his stomach ulcer is acting up, or something like that
But then everybody'd see he wasn't right and it wouldn't prove nothing
Listen, we got to have it understood
If he's not right, we call it off till he is
You're set on a real showdown, aren't you
Your mind's all made up
They start back off the pier
got to
You said yourself  got to
'm overdue
Yeah, you been around a long time -- was a lot younger than you when went up against Whistling Sam -- But you'd be kinda young too, to be The Man
gotta find out
(after a pause) Want me to set it up
(gratefully) wish you would, Shooter Man
All right
Hey, what if he turns me down
He won't, the way 'll spread the word
He'll have to take you on, someone in your class
If he ducked it, that'd make you The Man
You think he knows 'm around
He can smell meat like you a mile and a half up the river
He knows you're around and he'll sit down with you
You want to butt heads with The Man, 'll set it up
Ahead, on the levee,  is seen waiting for The Kid
She has not yet seen them as they approach off the pier
There's your woman
wouldn't want to wait around too long
want to get in and get it over with
He must of come to St
Louis for a big money game
'll probably get asked do  want to deal it for them
And however long that takes, he'll have to rest up for you
Oh, well, if he's tooling a dollar, can understand that
Sure
You got much of a stake
Close to three grand
Work on it
But three grand will give you a ride and even if you don't win, why you'll come away with a good idea of what you're made of
But once you go in Kid you can't quit
You get that straight right now
Two of you go in and only one of you can come out
Christian sees them and moves toward them
Well, school's out
damn sure don't want no lessons
want everything he's got
It's the only way to be, Kid
Shooter turns away abruptly as Christian arrives, giving her a brief nod
See you
The Kid takes Christian's arm automatically; he watches The Shooter walk way down Harold Street
He and Christian head in another direction
She is humming a mountain tune
When we leaving town, Kid
This week
No,  won't be ready
Not for a while
thought -- Might even turn out we don't go
She is surprised by this and, in her own hesitant way, curious
You must feel different about it than you did Saturday
He looks at her fondly and, for one fleeting moment of weakness, is actually tempted to tell her about Lancey
But it is too sharp a break with tradition
Yeah, 'm feeling a little different
( ) ' It is night and the room is lit only by a single lamp where Christian sits in her nightgown on a chair by the window, turning over the pages of a mail-order catalogue
In f
g
The Kid lies on his back under a sheet on the bed, his eyes closed and his hands clasped tensely behind his neck
He opens his eyes and turns to look at her
The movement catches her eye, and she instantly stops turning the pages, afraid the noise has disturbed him
It's all right
You don't have to act like a cat
You're not bothering me
You want me to turn out the light
No
'm overtired, that's why  can't sleep
(sits up and swings his feet to the floor) Why can't you sleep
(lightly) Undertired,  guess
If a person rests all day, she doesn't have much to rest up from at night
(stands up) Why don't you have a nice hot bath
could give you a rubdown and then you could have a nice hot bath, and then maybe you could sleep
She waits at the foot of the bed for him to come slowly to a decision
'Kay
Can't hurt to try it
She goes into the bathroom, where she turns the water on gently so the tub will take a long while to fill
Then she takes a bottle of alcohol from the medicine chest and returns to the bedroom with it
She stands in front of him waiting for him to move, but The Kid is singularly listless
Not till she sets the bottle down does he respond by turning his face to the pillow
She goes right to work on his shoulder muscles, and she seems to know what she is doing
What did you do with yourself this time
Last night  went to a movie with The Shooter's woman
French movie
In French
They had the words in English at the bottom of the picture
But The Shooter's woman knew what they were saying without it
Pig's woman or somebody told me she went to college
Sure
Majored in man-eating
think maybe she really did go
But never quite dared to up and ask her
didn't know you ran with The Shooter's woman
We got to be kind of friendly when you both were in that three-day game down to Cairo
'Course she's older'n me
And been around more
lot more
What was the movie like
Weird
It wasn't a straight story where you knew whose side you were on, the way you do in regular pictures
American pictures
Yeah
There were lots of things didn't understand
What was it about
Well, there's this town in Europe a long time ago where they get a message from a Spanish general he's coming to spend the night with his troops
So all the men are scared silly about what the soldiers will do to them
Nothing weird about that
But all the wives and daughters tell the men to go hide somewhere and let them bargain with the enemy
That don't make much sense
Wait
The way they handle it is they go to bed with the Spaniards
And the next morning the soldiers go off peacefully and everybody's happy
Including the husbands and fathers
Don't they suspect
That's part of what  wasn't sure of
guess they know what went on but they care more about their safety and their money than they do about their honor
Then they got their heads screwed on straight
Honor's just an idea
You can't see or feel it and you can't eat it and you sure as hell can't get any mileage on it
She slaps him on the rump and straightens up
'll just turn off the bath water
He doesn't move but just stays relaxed and closes his eyes
Christian, humming softly, turns off the water, takes a large towel from a rack and puts it on a stool by the tub where it will be more convenient for him
She lingers to test the water with her finger and do anything else she can think of to assure maximum comfort for her man
Then she steps back into the bedroom
The sight of him makes her advance cautiously and confirm her suspicion that he is asleep
' , The Shooter's woman, is sitting up in bed working on her eyebrows and listening to  turned up  on a radio
The bedside phone , barely audible above the radio
She answers it
(into phone) Hello
Yes, it is
You want him
(calling) Shooter
Telephone
Shooter
She gets no answer, which is no wonder in view of the noise from the radio
But the radio is across the room and it's slightly easier for her to get out of the side of the bed she's on, and go to the door of The Shooter's room
She opens this and we see The Shooter in bed in his own small quarters, reading a magazine
He turns around inquiringly
Phone for you
always seem to be the one to answer it, no matter who it's for
(getting up) If you'd rather we put it in my room -- Are you kidding
The Shooter picks up the phone but before he speaks into it, he pantomimes to her that he won't be able to hear over the radio
She seems to regard the request as an imposition but she does go grudgingly to the radio and turns it down a little before she returns to her bed and her cosmetic chore
(into phone) Hello
Well, hello
What brings you to our fair city
Little action, maybe
' Lancey, dressed for bed, is on the phone
(into phone) How could you guess, Shooter
was invited by a Mr
William Schlaegel -- ' (into phone) Owns most of the Schlaegel Brewery
Braumeister beer
The Shooter sits down on the edge of Melba's bed, the movement jostling her so she pricks herself with her tweezers
She exclaims in protest and gives him a dirty look that makes The Shooter stand right up again
' (into phone) As he put it, rather bluntly,  felt, we don't want everyone to have to watch everyone else dealing to see to it they don't make any little accidental errors by mistake
told him a man couldn't ask for a better guarantee of a fair-and-square game than having The Shooter deal it
So if you're willing, we're meeting at two o'clock in the afternoon
Ask for Mr
Schlaegel's suite at the Park Sherman
Good
'm glad you can do it, Shooter
Be a pleasure to see you again
(then) Oh pretty much the same
Just have to be a little careful about smoking and drinking and eating -- and breathing
See you tomorrow
Good night
He hangs up the phone, settles himself in a comfortable chair, and opens a heavy book
in  enough to reveal the title: Prescott's
' It is midday outside but the window shades are tightly drawn to keep the daylight from disturbing The Kid, who is still asleep
Christian, dressed for the street, moves from the bedroom to the kitchen-living room which is the remainder of the two-room apartment
Finding paper and pencil, she writes a quick note and leaves it on the kitchen table, then starts out
( ) - featuring one bathing suit displayed among others in an end- of-season sale with some such advertising message as "All bathing suits reduced 1/3 for clearance
" The particular suit is a two-piece one, exposing two or three inches of bare midriff -- the first modest forerunner of the trend that led eventually to the bikini
'  (
) Would you wear it in public
to include Christian and Melba looking at the display
Wouldn't be much point wearing it in private
Sure, why not, as long as you don't have a bulge to hide
They start walking
don't know, Melba
(looking her over) My guess is there isn't anything about you needs hiding
But 'll give you a more definitive opinion at the bath
(startled) At the what
Turkish Bath
After we're through shopping
'm treating you, Christian
never been
'm not even sure what you do
You don't do anything
That's what's so marvelous
They do it to you
( ) finds Christian and Melba among the perspiring females
The third time  stayed
Never went back to the boarding house except to pick up my things
And that side of it's held up
No complaints in the bed department
Well, just one
(intrigued) Yes
The nights he isn't there
He really does that to you, does he
You got one of the rare ones
( ) Christian and Melba are on adjoining rubbing tables, a curtain separating them from the waist down only
Their heads are close enough so they can talk without their masseurs necessarily hearing every word they say
You find a guy, you love him, and that's it
It's supposed to just go on like that for life
Right
According to the propaganda, right
But it isn't my life, it's his life, with me tacked on
You have any idea what it's like to be a hash slinger in a cheap restaurant
No, honey, the stock crash wafted me right from the daisy chain into unmarried bliss
It's hell, if you'll excuse the word
But  didn't want to quit
The Kid made me
felt  ought to hang on to something that was me away from him
You know what  mean
Sure
Some girls solve the problem by taking on an extra guy
'm serious
Having children might take care of it,  don't know
Or -- this is really a terrible thing to admit
Your most sordid secrets are safe with me
Confess
If he was rich, or famous -- Why don't you give him both
(smiling) Why not
Well, if he was rich and famous, maybe  wouldn't mind so much just being -- just a woman to him
Do you think that might make it seem more worthwhile somehow
Somehow
Are you sincere, sweetie
(reacting to the masseur's touch) Oooo -- divine
(to Christian) Isn't this heaven
'm not sure
In a way it seems soft of -- She is at a loss for a word
Decadent
Depraved
Christian looks blank
Wicked
Well, yes
That's what  meant by heaven
Lancey, Shooter and five other men are sitting in comfortably padded chairs around a well-appointed poker table
Everything about the game is in sharp contrast to the one The Kid played in
It is played with chips - expensive ones; there are a couple of bottles of wine on ice, fine cigars, a tray of sandwiches, etc
Lancey's opponents are all wealthy types; two of them could be Texas oil men
The youngest, a good- looking man of thirty, is
The Shooter, as nonplaying dealer, distributes fifth cards to the four remaining players in the hand, and both Lancey and Bill end up with four cards of one suit showing
(as he deals) Still queens -- possible flush -- no help -- possible flush
Queens check to the possibles
Check
Check
Bill silently tosses in two of the rarest and highest ranking chips on the table
Fold
And up two
Fold
Biggest pot yet
phone  and the Third Wealthy Type answers it
Call the two thou
(turning over queen of his suit) Queen high
(indignantly) Jack high
Can you beat that
He just did
(to Second Wealthy Type) It's your office
Dallas or Tulsa
She just said office
The Third Wealthy Type takes the phone and speaks on it during the ensuing
The Second Wealthy Type crosses to the bar and fixes himself a drink
Lancey takes in his winnings
Bill hasn't recovered from the blow
There is a hiatus in the game
How the bloody hell did you figure out  didn't have the king or the ace
recollect a young fellow putting the same question to Eddie the Dude
It was a game in the grand lounge of the "
White, Third," the largest paddle-wheeler ever built
"Son," Eddie told him, "All you paid was the looking price
Lessons are extra
" (turns to Shooter) First time  heard of this Cincinnati Kid was in New Orleans, at Yeller's
knew right away 'd have to play him someday
You'll enjoy his game
may admire it
But if he's all that good,  doubt if 'll enjoy it
The tougher the competition, the better you used to like it
've learned to take everything in moderation
- It is early evening
The Kid approaches the restaurant with Christian on one arm, Melba on the other
(to Melba) Have a drink with us
Better not
Shooter said they'd break at seven, and he has to have his food first, then his nap
(looking The Kid over) You know, there's a day in your life 'm looking forward to
In my life
The day The Kid becomes The Man
She smiles at them both and goes off
They move to enter the restaurant
( ) - The plates with the remains of their main course are in front of them
The Kid pours what's left of a bottle of beer into his glass
How'd you sleep Kid
slept okay
hope you don't mind my not being there when you woke up
No  don't mind -- (then) What she was talking about, Shooter's woman -- 'm going up against a big game soon
She told me
It's a very big game, hear
Yes
Will it be long
Why
(then) What's the matter
thought -- Thought what
'd go home and see Mama
wouldn't be able to spare you much change
Oh,  wouldn't want much
Bus is really the best way to go
Would a hundred fish do it
For the bus and something nice to bring your Mama
That would be fine, Kid
Just fine
When would you want to go
There's no reason for not going right now unless -- She lowers her eyes, finding it hard to say the words
Unless what
Unless you wanted to go to bed first
Do you want to
Would you like it
Un-huh
'd like it
You want dessert
No
You
(shakes head) Coffee
don't need it
Neither do
He looks o
s
raising a hand to summon the check
( ) '  - It is dark in the room and dark outside, the street lamps furnishing only enough light for a faint border around the window shade
Christian's head and nude back move into the Shot; she pulls the shade aside to look out
-   - '
- The time is a few minutes before ten
'  - She lets the shade fall back into place
Moving quietly in the darkness, she begins to dress
and to include The Kid, lying on the bed with a sheet over him
He seems to be asleep until he speaks
You still haven't said it
Said what
If you're coming back
Christian abandons the process of dressing herself and sits down in the easy chair to answer this question
Maybe  ought to stay with Mama and Papa a while, and see
What's to see
never did like city streets
Oh
Uh-huh
The promise didn't fulfill itself for me
Promise
Come to the city and all
Electric lights and flush toilets
All the pretty dreams -- it was all promise
Oh,  see
don't know if you do or not Kid -- You're city -- and 'm country -- You grew up with it
don't think that's why you're going -- because you like it so much better in the country
She doesn't comment one way or the other, nor does he press the point
What will you do
Well, 've got that big game
heard he's The Man for you
Yes
If  won, there would be a lot of money
You'll win
You been coming on strong a long way
This is your time
(then after a long moment) Come home with me to Mama's Kid
(finally) 'm sorry
(gently) know you are honey --  know it
She gets up and begins to pack her clothes in an old suitcase
After a moment The Kid gets out of bed
'll go down to the bus with you
You don't have to
(starting to dress) 'll go down with you
(after a pause) Kid -- Yeah
This is going to sound kind of funny to you, but  want to ask it
Sure
Do you think there's any chance, if you do win this big game, that you might do something else besides cards
(hastily) don't mean never play poker just mean not have it be the only thing you do
Hell, it's the only thing  know how to do
What else is there for a guy never finished school
College graduates are walking the streets looking for jobs -- trained people, engineers, scientists
realize -- (not letting her speak) When you're The Man, you don't have to hustle -- When you're The Man, The Best, the Big Money comes around on their knees just beggin' to hustle you
'm not goin' to quit
'm goin' to win
Yes,  can see that
Of course didn't say quit
Well you see how it is
That's all right
(after a moment) Christian, you aren't doing this to be off my back, in case  lose
been thinking about it a long time
been planning to go home and see how  felt about things
And this just helped you decide
That's all
Then don't go
(firmly) No, this is your time -- Now you go on Honey and you play The Man -- 'll be at Mama's
She closes the suitcase and puts on the one dress she hasn't packed
The Kid, dressed now, watches her for a moment then goes to the bottom drawer of the dresser and opens it to reveal a stack of money under a shirt
He takes five clean twenty-dollar bills and counts them on to the top of the dresser, snapping the crisp leaves gambler style
Then he stoops down again and takes out two more twenties, adding them to the pile
wish it could be more
That's all right
He doesn't actually hand her the money
He leaves it on top of the dresser and she goes over and takes it, folding the bills and putting them in her change purse
The Kid picks up her suitcase, and she leads the way into the other room
At the front door she stops and looks back at the little apartment for a moment
don't guess 'll ever forget these rooms, Kid
don't guess  will either
You going to move
If  win, it won't be good enough
If  lose,  lose it all
She looks at him for a moment, then exits
He follows
( ) -  - The Kid and Christian sit in silence
She puts her hand on his
( ) The Kid and Christian sit on a bench in the waiting room, still silent
He has her suitcase between his legs and a pile of magazines on his lap
She looks at a clock and gets to her feet
He follows her to the door, carrying the suitcase and magazines
- Christian boards a bus that has seen better days
On the steps she turns to take the bag from him, but he follows her on
- Christian takes a seat
The Kid puts her suitcase in the overhead rack and hands her the magazines, none of which would be classed as heavy reading
Goodbye, Kid
Good luck
Goodbye, Christian
They don't kiss
He turns and goes out
- There are not many passengers boarding this bus
After a couple of moments, the driver closes the door and starts off
Christian waves from the window, and The Kid waves back to her
When the bus has gone, he walks around the outside of the terminal to the front
- There are a couple of cabs at a taxi stand
One of the hackies offers his services to The Kid, but The Kid declines
He wants to walk
( ) It is midday and the poker game is almost twenty- four hours old
Our attention is focused on Bill Schlaegel, who is writing out a check
Four stacks
Right, Schooter
Four
The Shooter takes advantage of the lull in the proceedings to move to the telephone
Thank you for the entertainment, gentlemen
My particular gratitude to you, Lancey
It's been a rare pleasure to watch a great artist at work
Thank you for the privilege
Lancey gives him a quick look, finding this a bit thick
Well now, son, you're quite welcome
Can't say  recall another man, in all my days on the three rivers, who seemed to find it quite so pleasurable losing all that money
Bill puts his check down in front of The Shooter's place, and gets to his feet
Good day, gentlemen
You're welcome to use the premises as long as you like
with Bill as he passes The Shooter, who is waiting on the phone while the hotel operator dials his number
Bill gives him a friendly pat on the back, and speaks in a low, harsh voice for The Shooter's ears alone
want to see you
Bill goes out
Shooter looks after him as his party comes on the phone
(into phone) Hi, Kid
Shooter here
Listen, told the woman 'd take her to the ball park, but 'm still working
How about you and Christian take her out
' (into phone) Christian's gone home to see her folks
(into phone) Oh
(then) Well listen, would you mind taking her yourself
The gang'll be there, in the section
Thanks
Appreciate it
See you
He hangs up, returns to the table and starts to shuffle the cards in his own spectacular way
( ) ,
- game is in progress between the Cardinals and another National League club
The batter at the plate connects for a long one
the flight of the ball
- They are making their way to meet their friends in the section they prefer
They stop to watch the ball as the fans around them rise to their feet
The section they have just reached is in the sun, overlooking the outfield
An outfielder races back and makes a difficult catch
- They start on their way again
ahead of them to a group consisting of Hoban; ' , still sexy in her forties; , whose name could derive with equal justification from either his looks or his manners; and , who talks colloquial American with a Central European accent
The group as a whole is notable because its members have not risen to their feet with everyone else, because all the men are basking in the sun with their shirts off, because they view the action on the field with detachment, and because, nevertheless, they are constantly placing bets on details of the game
Now, as people around them resume their seats, Sokal is able to confirm that the fly ball has been caught
(to Hoban) You owe me two fish on the out, plus three on the inning, minus two on no strikeouts so far
The Kid and Melba join them
Hiya, Kid
Getting yourself in shape for The Man
(to Melba) Shooter still on the job
' Where's Christian
(in a whisper) Lay off that
What'd she do, take off
So did mine
Don't lose no sweat, Kid, there's plenty more where they came from
All shapes and sizes
Hi, Hoban
Sokal
Pig
He and Melba sit down
(to Sokal) Boyer
One to two on the sacrifice
Five to three, 'll give you
Two- fifty against one-fifty
Mark it
figure they'll walk him
Fill up first
Not with who's coming up
'll take the same odds
While he is talking, Melba unbuttons his shirt
Get some of this sun
(to The Kid) Mark it
(to Melba) Guess  will
He takes his shirt off
Melba finds some suntan lotion in her bag, and applies it to her face and arms, her eyes rarely straying from The Kid
Bunting, Sokal
The bunt is fielded by the first baseman, who throws to second for the out
There is no play at first
So they pitched to him
still win
(to Kid) Everybody been on the phone to everybody about coming to watch you and Lancey
Big Spriigi, Yeller to 'Orleans, Old Lady Fingers
They're all coming
(to Kid) Let me give you some of this
Keep you from burning
don't think -- Can't hurt you
Without waiting for his approval, she goes ahead and spreads the lotion on his skin, painstakingly, as if she were applying paint to canvas, working it in, one area at a time, with her fingertips
(to Sokal) Chance to invest your profits
Bet you an even fin he make first
(looking toward plate) Who we got -- Warwick
You got yourself a bet, pal
The men concentrate their attention on the diamond to Melba's fingers playing across The Kid's midriff
From the field comes the sharp  of a bat against a ball, followed by a  from the crowd
to the faces of Melba and The Kid as he looks at her and she meets his gaze with inviting eyes
' Not your day, Hoban
(calling to a vendor) Hey, beer
(softly) Mais tu es charmant -- : '  -  - With the same look of invitation in her eyes
Charmant
Come here, please
Wearing the same clothes as at the ball park, she is sitting in a chair with her legs tucked under her
The Kid is sitting on a straight chair at a table on which he has a cup of coffee
They are alone in the apartment
Any special reason
Me
'm special
He stands up but doesn't move toward her
Sure you are
You're The Shooter's woman
Right
And maybe 'll go on being The Shooter's Woman, even after you and  have had our little romp
What do you think about that
First place, Old Shooter'll come barging through that door any minute
He said they were winding it up
No barging
He doesn't have his key with him
(stands up) Have to buzz from downstairs
(moves toward him provocatively) So we can treat ourselves to a little sample of things to come
The Kid stays where he is as she comes up against him
Also it don't mean anything to you, you're Christian's friend
Honey, she lost her franchise the minute she got on that bus
You know that
(her arms around him) have a shaky sense of security, Kid
Don't make me feel unwanted
He kisses her and lets himself enjoy it for a while, then pulls away
No good
You know damn well how good it was
Where's a pack of cards
What do we need cards for
Gin or casino, you name it
All know is we're switching to another indoor sport
The poker game is over
Two of the Wealthy Types have already departed; one is finishing a drink on the way out; another is putting his winnings into his wallet; a third is writing out a check
Lancey and The Shooter still sit at the table in f
g
Lady Fingers'll want to come,  bet, and she's right on the edge of her stake
She could spell me dealing
Sure, sure
Haven't seen the dear old bitch in fifteen years
Well, that's it, then
Monday night, Room Three-Eleven at the Dorset Hotel
And may the best man win
Yes, that's how it usually comes out in the long run
You think this boy is going to give me trouble, Shooter
Yeah, he's going to give you trouble
don't want it to be one of those marathon games
Not any more
Like the session with The Portugee at Jolly's in Omaha
Remember
Sure, sure
Longest game  ever played though,  was a kid on my way to the Klondike gold rush
At Soapy Smith's in Skagway
Four nights and three days
You win
Depends how you look at it
When we wound up, the Yukon River had frozen over and you couldn't get through to Dawson City till the following June
Made myself a Hundred and fifty bucks and missed the gold rush
You been around a long time
That is undeniably true
But it doesn't mean 'm ready to retire
How old is this boy of yours
Twenty-six, twenty-eight, something like that
Well, now, makes me feel a whole lot better, knowing that
was thirty- six when  sliced up Eddie the Dude
This Kid of yours is just going to have to wait a few years
,   - He is standing by an elevator in f
g
keeping watch on a row of room doors including the site of the poker game
is an impressive physical specimen whose capacity for brutality is masked by a quiet, deferential manner
When he sees a door open, he moves so as to be out of The Shooter's sight as the latter comes toward him
It isn't until The Shooter rounds the corner in f
g
and presses the button for the elevator that Felix makes his presence known
Excuse me, Mr
Shooter, sir, but Mr
Schlaegel asked me to remind you how eager he was to see you
The doors of the elevator open
Felix yields precedence to The Shooter and they enter it
The doors close
,   - An elevator opens, and The Shooter and Felix come out
ought to call my woman
Yes, of course
They always like to know it if you're going to be late for supper
with them as The Shooter leads the way to a row of telephone booths and enters one
'  - They are sitting at the table in a game of casino
She plays an ace from her hand, adds a seven from the board, and lays them both on top of a three-card pile
Still building eights
Thanks for putting it together for me
He plays an eight and takes in the whole pile
It's not my game
The telephone
She stands up
Want to know what is
her to the phone
She picks it up
(into phone) Hello -- Oh, hi, sugar -- why not
She reaches a hand around to the back of her neck, fiddles with her dress a moment, then beckons in The Kid's direction
- He doesn't understand what she wants but he gets up and comes to her obligingly,   with him
(into phone) What's the switch
She points to the hook-and-eye fastener at the top of the zipper that runs down the back of her dress
The Kid pantomimes the question "What for
" but she just wiggles her finger impatiently at the fastener while speaking into the phone
(into phone) Whose idea was that
The Kid still doesn't know what she has in mind but it seems easier to humor her than not
He unfastens the hook
Melba smiles her thanks and, to his consternation, reaches back and pulls the zipper all the way down
She places her hand over the mouth-piece of the phone
(to Kid) He's not coming home now
She steps out of the dress
(into phone) Whatever you say, Shooter man
,   - (into phone) Explain to The Kid, will you
'  - Melba in her bra and panties, snuggles against The Kid
(into phone) He'll understand
,   - (into phone) Tell him they decided to play a little longer, and 'll call him at his place later when the game's over
Right
Goodbye, honey
He hangs up the phone and emerges from the booth with him as he joins Felix and they walk toward the hotel entrance
'  - The Kid, his policy toward this new situation still unresolved, holds her lightly while he tries to think it out aloud
Listen, Melba -- have to tell you first
You're sitting down with Lancey next Monday night
wish it was sooner
wish it was tomorrow
Shooter'll give you all the details later
don't like waiting that long
Let's not kick a gift horse in the teeth, sugar
We've got this time together
Let's try to "fill each unforgiving minute with sixty seconds worth of distance run
" She invites a kiss and he obliges her
But there is a contrary force at work inside him
Listen, what  was going to say before,  don't want you to think 'm being some kind of jerk or don't feel you'd be great to sack up with
Then let's cut the filibuster
've made dolls that were friends of mine's wives
figured if they were willing, they were doing it to their husbands,  wasn't
Of course
Any other attitude, you're degrading the woman
You're not treating her as a person with a mind of her own, but as somebody's property
Again she presses close to him and again he savors her for a moment
Only thing is, it's different with The Shooter than anybody else
He's so straight,  got the obligation to be straighter with him than other people
So do you
On account of we both owe him plenty
thought we just agreed that what you and  did was strictly between us
Can't be
(decisively, pulling away from her with a pat of dismissal) Shooter's the closest thing to family got
It's almost like he was my old man
Don't you see how that's got a bearing on us
He starts out
Melba stares after him, scarcely able to believe what is being done to her
Sure, it means 'm your mother
- An expensive automobile, with Felix at the wheel and The Shooter next to him in the front seat, approaches the main house of a lavish estate in a St
Louis suburb
It continues along the driveway past the house
-  - In swimming trunks, Bill is spoon-feeding a year-old  in a highchair
Looking o
s
, he waves in greeting to The Shooter
- He walks from the parked car toward the pool, returning Bill's salutation
from behind The Shooter as he approaches the attractive family group that includes, besides Bill and the baby, a --  who is having her hair brushed after swimming by  , her beautiful mother family dog completes the picture
Bill continues to feed the baby as he hails The Shooter
Shooter -- very generous of you to come on such short notice
Rosanna you know, and  think you've met my daughter June
(indicating baby) No point introducing you to William the Fourth
He has a bad memory for names
(greeting them in turn) Mrs
Schlaegel
How are you, June
What's it all about, Bill
Little something 'd like to sound you out on
But the least  can do is offer you a drink
Like me to fix it, love
Wonderful
Why don't you do a batch of your Bloody Marys
If that's okay with you, Shooter
Great
Whatever
As she goes off, Rosanna cautions June about her hair
Just don't let it get wet again
As soon as his wife is gone, Bill goes right to the topic he doesn't want to discuss in her presence
've been quite busy on the telephone since  last saw you
There's a lot of interest all over the country in this game with Lancey and The Kid
Betting interest
Jack Doyle in New York is giving twelve to five on Lancey
Same odds in Reno
've taken fifty thousand of it so far
Fifty thousand
'll probably go for more but  didn't want to rock the odds
knew you liked The Kid's style but why you going in so deep
Two reasons
First,  want to see that smug old bastard gutted worse than he gutted me
Second, as long as that's going to happen,  don't see why  shouldn't make some money out of it
But how can you be so sure
The Kid could do it, we both know that, but -- "Could" isn't good enough for a man who hates to lose money as much as do
He's going to need help -- from the best man with a pack of cards between Omaha and New Orleans
Not a chance, Bill
You ought to know  never ever use what  got with the cards for nothing but tricks and dressing up a game
Sure,  know it
That's why you're the man they choose to give them a square deal
That's what makes it so perfect
Nobody'll be looking for it
It's out
Out
The great thing is they'll be so close, The Kid won't need much
Three or four key hands
Understand this, Bill
'd like for The Kid to win, and  sure as hell don't want to see you lose all that money -- If  did, 'd have to collect that twelve grand you owe me
Not myself
My collection agents
You knew poor Wildwood Jones, didn't you
but 'm paying it off
It's comin' in ain't it
Six grand already
(then as Bill just looks at him) Bill, you got to listen to me --
No,  don't
It's quite the other way around
You have some delusion you're a free agent, but you're not
own you
For God's sake --
Shut up
'll cross the twelve off the books and give you ten thousand dollars in cash
And you can tell The Kid if he needs more of a stake, 'll put it up
(looks o
s
and smiles) Marvelous
Here's Rosanna with what you need
to include Rosanna carrying a tray with glasses and a pitcher full of Bloody Marys
-- for that dry feeling on the roof of your mouth
( ) '  -   -  - It is raining dismally
- He is lying on one half of the bed, with the covers thrown back, his hands clasped behind his head, wearing pajama bottoms
He turns his head and stares at the white expanse of unoccupied bed
( ) - The weather is clear as The Kid wanders idly along a residential street of well-kept nineteenth century buildings
( ) - He is drinking a bottle of beer slowly
to another bar stool where a customer is having his shoes shined by a who slaps his rag against the shoes with a fine sense of rhythm
Finished, he collects his dime and nickel tip, and moves to The Kid
Shine them up for you sir
No, thanks
Fetch you a newspaper maybe
No
How about a singy-song then
play good
Play what
The Boy takes out a tobacco can with the lid torn off and the top flattened down and shakes it, producing a sound like the rustle of dry leaves
Then he produces a similar can that makes a rattling noise when he shakes it
Dry corn in this one
Blue shale stone from the river in this one
You ready
Yes, 'm ready
The Boy looks at the , who has moved closer to see what's going on
(to bartender) You ready
Hell, 'm ready for anything
The Boy stands perfectly still for a few seconds, then begins to shake the can with corn in it
After a bit he brings in the shale stone can with the other hand to chord and accent the rustle of the first can
At the same time he begins to sing a simple song in a pure, delicate voice
It is catfish music created on the spot and sounds strangely like the idle tunes Christian likes to hum
(when the song is over) Thank you very much
That was nice
Where did you learn to do that
picked it up from Herman
Who is Herman
My friend  pick it up from
Is he a good friend
don't know 'bout that suh
He just a frien' who teach me some things
Well,  don't want a shine, but here's fifteen cents
Thank you, sir
And here's another dime for you, fella
He rings up a   and flips a dime to The Boy, who is astonished and then worried by this munificence
Suddenly he grabs his tobacco cans and his shoe-shine kit, and runs out into the street
Nice little colored kid
(mostly to himself) -- Yeah
( ) - , a masseur, is at work loosening up The Kid's neck and shoulders
Monday night, uh, Kid
Monday night
sprung for some of the action yard and a half of that five-to-two
Thanks, Jansen
(in pain) Hey
We got to get you loosened up never felt you this tight
( ) -   - He is in the middle of a call
(into phone) Just tell The Shooter 'll be there on the dot Monday night
' (over the phone) And until then
He doesn't have to know
'  - (into phone) 'm not asking for him
- He hangs up the phone, rather than continue the discussion
him as he comes out of the booth, picks up a small duffel bag, and walks to the door that leads to the busses
He goes out into the night and gets into a bus
( ) - bus drives along a main road in the Ozarks, heading toward As it comes close, the name of its destination: "" can be read
- The bus stops momentarily at a small cluster of buildings around an intersection
The Kid is the only passenger to get off here
As the bus continues on its way, he goes to an attendant in a gas station on one corner, and asks a question
Referred to a general store and post office on another corner, he crosses and goes into it
The  comes back outside with him to point out the route to where he wants to go
It is along a dirt road that winds uphill behind the store
The Kid starts up the road
( ) - The Kid reaches the summit of the hill directly behind the crossroads, and looks down into the valley between this hill and the next one
He starts down an even narrower road leading to a little farm on a hillock in the valley
It consists of a modest cabin, a single barn, a fenced cow pasture, and a few cultivated fields
( ) - Christian comes around a curve in a path on one side of the house, carrying two five-gallon milk cans slung in a yoke over her shoulder
little dog  and runs from the front door of the house to the front gate
She looks in that direction and   to include The Kid as he unlatches the gate and walks toward her
After a moment's hesitation, she moves to meet him, gliding on her bare feet to keep the water in the cans from slopping out
Hello, Kid
Can  help you with those
Taking if off is harder than taking it on in
She turns toward the side of the house and walks to the kitchen door
The Kid follows
How's The Shooter
Fine
You haven't played yet
Monday
- , , Christian's mother, opens the door for them, giving The Kid a sharp, appraising glance
This is Eric, Mama
He's come to see me
How do, Eric
Christian crosses to the drain sink near the pump and turns her back
Mrs
Craigie lifts the cans off the yoke on to the drain board
She and Christian each take a can and pour the water from it to prime the pump
We lost suction on the pump right in the middle of canning
The Kid looks at the stove with a couple of large steaming pots on it, and the table alongside with a half-dozen hampers of green beans
There's coffee
And sour ham and bread in the warmer, if you're hungry Eric
As soon as they are finished with the pump, Mrs
Craigie and Christian turn to the table, where they begin to snip stems and cut beans before putting them into the pots on the stove
You know anything about canning, you know we can't stop now
If we'd been looking for company, we never would have started
Spring beans, you have to cook them fast
But you find yourself some breakfast
'm all right
Bus stopped for doughnuts and coffee
You can stay with us tonight and still make it back to St
Lou on the Sunday schedule by about midnight told Mama and Papa about The Man
And all
Where is Mr
Craigie
To the barn
Why don't you go down and introduce yourself
Christian and me'll be at this another hour or two
think  will
think 'd like that
(to Christian) Okay
Sure
And 'll see you a little later on
(then, as he starts out) Papa don't know everything
About you and me
The Kid looks quickly at her and then at Mrs
Craigie, who keeps her gaze fixed on the beans
-  - He is pitching manure from all over the cow-lot into a pile banked against the side of the barn, working a long-handled shovel with practised ease
He looks o
s
and sees The Kid approaching but continues his work as The Kid enters the Nor does he stop shoveling while they are talking, except at moments of particular significance to him
Hello
How do you do, Mr
Craigie
'm Eric Stoner
Christian's Eric
That's right
You seen her
She's helping her mother can
You minding to marry Christian
The Kid looks at him a long moment then -- You got any objections if  do, or if  don't
Craigie takes a couple of steps toward The Kid, his boots sucking in the muddy ground
Son, that's what  call a sharp answer
It was what  call a sharp question
We don't know much about you, Christian's mother and me
'm what's known as a three-river man
Which just means  go around playing stud poker wherever  can find the kind of action 'm looking for
You met Christian when she was working to Hot Springs
Yeah
was playing in this game in the hotel and she was a waitress in the coffee shop
We went out
told her  thought she could get a better job in St
Louis
Now how did you happen to tell her that
Maybe you run some kind of employment service on the side
said it because  wanted her in St
Louis
Anyway, she made it there and she called me and we been seeing each other ever since
Living together
The Kid takes his time before deciding how to answer this one
Yeah, living together
How come she come home now
She going to have a baby
Not that  know of
You two have a fight
No
She must have had a reason
Think so
Well, you've known her longer than me
(then) Look, Mr
Craigie, let me and Christian find out a few things then maybe  won't have to answer your questions
never run across anybody like you
guess  don't understand gamblers
That's all right
don't understand farmers
You say things that sound smart alecky
But 'm not sure if they really are smart alecky
Well  can't take into account what somebody's going to feel every time say something
Are you a believer
In some things
mean in God
That's a tough one
don't disbelieve in Him, but  couldn't say  believed in Him either
guess  just never paid Him much mind
Didn't seem important
God not important
don't mean what He does isn't important -- if He exists
mean it's not important to me whether He exists or not
Christian was raised in a Christian home
Is that so
didn't know --- (then) 'm not aware of the difference
(pause) 'm not asking permission to marry Christian, you know
know
If  was, the only person 'd be asking it from is her
(after a moment) Who is this fella Christian says you're going to play that's so important
He's the king of the stud poker players
And you're going to play him
Yes
Are you any good
'm this good
The Man has got to play me
What happens if he don't
Then 'm The Man
That important to you
been trying to figure that out ever since  set it up
You playing because of money
(after a moment) Not really
Christian said you never was much worried about money --  been worried about money most of my life -- up until  figured out it wasn't so important
No, it's necessary, but it isn't so important
Well how come you want to play this King fella
Ambition -- maybe security, like that
Is it aspiration to be the King or just uncertainty about the future
ain't looking for security if that's what you mean
Not trying to lock something up tight and nail it down
That would figure into it
But that isn't all of it
-- It's important to me
Now son which is more important to you, this king business or Christian
If you got the guts to ask that question, Mr
Craigie,  guess  got the guts to answer it
Christian, if you came right down to it, is not as important as doing what  have to do
Craigie has finished piling the manure
He puts away his shovel
Well son,  had to know
Know what
There never was a man worth a damn, to my mind, who let his woman stand in the way of the thing he had to do
(then) got to go now -- see what  can do for a sick heifer
Why don't you take Christian, when her Mama lets go of her, and tell her  said you should go to the old spring
It's a good place
Thanks
'll tell her
Craigie walks away
( ) - It is a small shack against a rocky bluff Christian and The Kid as they come down the path and enter
It stays warm all winter
: to reveal Christian and The Kid, who are in the pool without clothes, treading water
Papa's mama used to bring her wash up here
We liable to draw an audience
Don't worry
It's on our land -- Nobody uses it
She starts to swim,   with her upper back as she reaches the side of the pool and pulls herself on to the bank, lying on her stomach
The Kid joins her, first drawing himself up on his stomach alongside her, then turning on his back to look through the slats at the sun
You must have said something to Papa gave him the picture on us in St
Lou
Else he never would have spoke to you about this place
told him on account of he already knew
Never any sense feeding a man a lie he's not going to believe
Even if he did know, 'm glad you told him
She raises herself up so that she is directly above him
(in mock protest) Hey, you're all wet
So are you, foolish
( ) -     - The two men are sitting just outside the kitchen, where Mrs
Craigie and Christian are pasting labels on the mason jars they filled earlier
The paste and some of the jars are just inside an open window on a shelf behind the men's heads
The light comes from a kerosene lamp inside
Let me get this straight in my head
Cards is all a matter of luck, who gets dealt the best ones
The Kid stands up and selects six playing cards from a deck in his pocket
During the next few lines he uses the paste on the shelf to stick together three pairs of them so as to form three double-thick cards
One of these has two faces, another two backs, and the third a back and a face
So when one of you professional gamblers sits down with a bunch of your -- what do you call them -- customers, clients
The technical term is "suckers
" Or "marks
" Their chance of winning is just as good as yours, except if you got a way to control it, who gets what cards
Right
Not right
That's cheating and it's not any part of what we're talking about
Then how do you win
'll show you
He displays his three cards
You see one of these cards is white on both sides, one is red on both sides, and the other is white on one side, red on the other
What about it
The Kid lifts a straw hat off a peg on the porch wall
This
put the three cards in a hat and shake them up, and then  ask you to draw one card out blind
Put it face down on the table so neither of us can see the bottom side
Craigie does as instructed
The ensuing dialogue assumes the card he picks is red on top; if it's white the words "red" and "white" will be reversed in the dialogue
Okay, red on top
That eliminates the all-white card, right
So the card you've picked is one of two -- the all-red or the red-and-white
One out of two is an even chance, an even-money proposition
Right -- you follow me
think so
So if  said 'll bet you a dollar to seventy-five cents the other side of that card is red, you'd take the bet wouldn't you
Seems like
Yeah
And that answer makes you a sucker
Because the odds are two to one, the other side of that card is red, and ought to be offering you a dollar to fifty cents instead of seventy- five
But if there are just the two possibilities
There are three possibilities
(indicating card on table) That can be the red side of the red- and-white card, or it can be either side of the all-red card
In two cases out of three the other side is red
And 'd win the bet from you two out of every three times we made it
(dubiously) You would
Sure
It's obvious when  explain it, isn't it
Reckon so
Except if there's only two things that the bottom side can be, red or white -- Take my word for it -- the odds are two to one
And knowing that is the difference between your gambling man and your sucker
Not who gets the better cards but who knows what the proper odds are
In a poker game there can be a million different situations, each with a different set of odds to figure
The man who ends up winners is the man who knows when to bet and how much
The sucker is still took advantage of, isn't he
The gambler knows something he don't know
Sure -- like if you grow better corn or raise a cow that gives more milk than the other guy's
Or two business men are in competition, or two lawyers are up against each other in a courtroom
Whatever your line is, the one who wins out is the one who knows his job better
Seems like there should be something else to it -- There is -- Making the man you're playing against think he's got the best hand -- and making him pay to find out
( ) - He is lying on a cot in the darkness, next to the big wood- burning stove
Christian enters the  and slips under the covers with him
can't stay long
Papa'll be getting up to milk
'm the one can't stay
got to head for that bus
Why did you come, Kid
Well, hell,  don't know
had kind of a rough time after you left
Rough how
Tuesday there was a ball game, but then the Cardinals went on the road
never known time to drag so;  was all torn apart -- Because of the poker game coming up
That's how  read it, but  was reading it wrong
It wasn't Lancey or the game that was chewing at my insides -- What else is there could give you such a bad time
finally figured it
located where the trouble was
It was you
She is genuinely surprised at this and at first a bit dismayed
But her more considered reaction is one of pleasure
Oh, -- She kisses him
When you talk about doing something besides poker if  get to be The Man, you don't mean pass up the chance to make some dough from it for a while
sure don't
told Papa, wherever money comes from, it feels the same when you spend it
You were going to do some thinking down here
done some
Then they both react as Craigie can be heard getting up
'll be back after the game Christian -- You wait here for me and 'll let you know
All right Eric -- Good luck Monday
She gives him a quick kiss and stands up
got that made now
You said it right
My time's come
( ) -  (-) The sun hasn't risen yet as The Kid boards the bus for St
Louis outside the general store
- The Kid's bus crossing the endless plain in the afternoon sun
- The clock above the loading platform says it is a little after two in the morning as the bus pulls up, and The Kid, groggy from the long ride, gets out
' He enters wearily, goes straight into the bedroom and collapses on the bed
After a moment he summons the energy to loosen his shoelaces and kick his shoes off
But that completes his preparations for sleep
' The Shooter is awake because he can't sleep, and Melba is awake because she is trying to persuade him to do what she considers prudent
He sighs deeply as she solicitously pours him a cup of coffee
Twenty-five years  been building a reputation
Handle this thing right and your reputation will be better than ever
' Lancey is also awake, confronting a row of medicine bottles
He finishes laying out an assortment of four different pills and capsules, pours himself a glass of hot milk from a carafe, and proceeds to take the pills one at a time, with a sip of milk after each
( ) ' The Kid, looking completely refreshed, is readying himself for the game
He has chosen casual, comfortable clothes, and now he collects three items to take with him: a large bottle of mouthwash, a green sun-vizor, and finally, his stake
When he withdraws the money from the dresser drawer, we can see the pile has increased in size
The Kid finds an envelope to put it in, and he is ready to go
He starts out but in the middle of the kitchen he stops to look at his watch
It is too early
He crosses to the stove, pours himself a cup of coffee, and sits down to drink it
' Lancey has decided on a change of costume from his last game, and this time he goes for the old-fashioned velvet smoking jacket and silk foulard
Over this he puts on a light overcoat
Then he assembles medicines, toilet articles and money, putting them all into a small satchel
Finally, he puts on his hat and goes to the door
We follow Lancey's progress as far as the elevator
' Melba and Shooter have finished dressing, and he waits by the door while she does the inevitable last-minute things to her makeup
made up my mind to this
ain't going to give him any help till he needs it
'm glad you're taking a stand
Hey, what if he starts off lucky and stays ahead of the game the whole way
It could happen, you know
You'll make it happen, Baby
've got faith in you -- - The hands are at 7:25
-     - The Kid is looking at the clock tower
Once more around the square
- The taxi drives away from  following The Kid's instruction
to the front of the Dorset Hotel, which they have just passed
It is fifty years old or more, no longer elegant but still respectable
- He is standing at ease among old friends, sipping a creme de menthe frappe
It's a friendly town, St
Louis
've always said that
to take in the people around him, one after another
The Shooter is there, and Pig and Sokal and Hoban, and Melba and Hoban's woman and a couple of other women whose main attributes are physical, and Bill Schlaegel
Out of town representatives include  , who is about fifty, down on her luck but still cheerful and remarkably energetic; and , a light-skinned Negro who has achieved stature in what is mainly a white man's world, through diplomacy and a quick wit
The room is the large living-room of a once splendid suite; there are enough chairs and couches around the walls to accommodate a good many spectators, while the middle of the room has been cleared for a round table with seven chairs
We ain't seen much of you though, last seven, eight years
Climate, Shooter
In my declining years,  spend more and more time in Florida and the Gulf Coast
Lot of folks been figuring another reason you was keeping clear of the three rivers
What reason is that, Lady Fingers
Cincinnati Kid
(laughs) That the way it is, Lancey
You been scared of The Kid
Should  be scared of him
Damn right you should
'm telling you, that boy going to make your stomach ulcer bleed before the night is out
He's close to murder
seen him give a fella the shakes so bad on a fourth card, it took a pint of corn liquor to settle him down
Thanks for the warning
Lancey notices that most of the people around him have turned to look at the doorway
He glances in the same direction in a casual sort of way
He saunters toward Lancey
Almost everyone greets him, and he responds to as many as he can
Melba intercepts him
Mow the man down, sugar pie, make it quick and bloody
Been too many lean years for all of us
intend to take Shooter right along with Lancey
'm not talking about the old Shooter
He's been factory rebuilt
new spirit dwelleth in him, and his gaze is on distant hills
The Kid would like these cryptic words explained, but Lady Fingers descends on him
So you showed up after all
You're a braver boy than  thought, so much the worse for you
You think 'll be sorry  come
Bound to
That Lancey ain't human, he's one of them barracuda fish
He's liable to bleed to death, right on a flush hand before he give up to you
seen him gut a fella so bad, the fella quit and got up and spit red in the john and went square
The Kid sees Lancey approaching, and turns to him
Hello, Kid
Pleasure to know you
Lancey
been looking forward a long time
Sure, sure
You seem to know about everybody
Yeller from New Orleans
What do you say, Yeller
Still feeling salty with me
Forgiven long since
(to Lancey) We had a little jurisdictional dispute
hustled a couple of boys, right in his territory
So  tried to tell him our rules down there
Colored marks are for colored hustlers
And  tried to tell him how  got no prejudice
When 'm on the edge of my stake,  hustle anybody at all, regardless of race, creed or color
Anybody at all
Including my girl
Hell,  figured  was doin' you a favor
You did
Suddenly they both laugh over a private memory and shake hands, obviously old friends
(to Lancey) Did you know Old Cottonhead died
No,  hadn't heard
Heart give out in a high-low game
(turning to The Kid) How you feel, Kid
Great
You
The best
You think maybe we ought to see if we can stir up some action
Whatever you say, Lancey
You're the -- (correcting himself) You're our guest in this town
Well, 'm kind of in the mood to play a little cards
think we ought to be able to get a game together in this crowd
But first you take a look at things -- make sure everything's the way you want it
already been around
Thanks
'll do that
He turns toward the center of the room
The Shooter follows him
-    - The old, solidly built wooden table has been covered with a white linen cloth on top of a blanket
The cloth is tied down under the rim so that the surface of the table is flat, tight and cushioned by the blanket
The Kid presses his fingers into it to test these factors
It's an old table
Everything's pretty old in this hotel
It's solid, that's what counts
And you got the top fixed perfect
Lancey comes into the  behind them
Light all right for you
Two hundred watt bulb
Fine, excellent
Okay with you
Sure, sure
Shooter's set us up just great
Sure has
Thank you, gents
Tried to do the best  could
(looks from one to the other) Cards
Why not
Good a time as any
(calling) Hoban
Okay
(to Kid and Lancey) You both know Joe Hoban
He's a draw poker man, but clean and straight as they come
Hoban comes into the  with a dispatch case, which he sets on the table
He unlocks it with a key and turns it upside down
Thirty sealed decks of cards spill on the table
They come from the St
Louis Bridge Club, but they're poker size cards
They been bonded by the club steward and  seen him take them out of the safe
Shooter, Lady Fingers and me pick them up and come straight here with them
Hoban's selling them to us at five dollars a pack, with the usual guarantee
If it's proved any deck is spooked, he pays off the losers
St
Louis Bridge Club, eh
Steward still that old yard bird Okra
(disturbed) That's him
(not noticing; to Kid) Old stud man, Okra
don't know him
Quite a character
Quite a character
(anxiously) Nobody heard from me what the cards were for, Kid
There is a quick exchange of glances all around as the other three realize what the imaginary suspicion is behind Hoban's defensive reaction
(to Kid) Been ten years since  seen or spoke to Old Okra
'Kay, fine
Don't worry about it, Lancey
Who's sitting down with us, Shooter
Four of us
Me, Pig, Yeller and Doc Sokal
If that's all right with you both
'Kay, fine
Sure, sure
(to Kid) Shall we have a look at the decks
- with the pile of decks and the empty dispatch case on the table in front of them
They start checking the decks one by one, each putting the ones he has covered in a pile for the other's consideration
They examine the seals and the cellophane visually, and they also sniff both ends for the odor of a hot iron
By the time they are through with this process; The Kid has found three decks he isn't satisfied with, and Lancy two
The Kid passes his three rejects to Lancey, who tosses them back into the dispatch case without looking at them
Then Lancey tries to submit his two to The Kid, but The Kid waves them away, and Lancey throws them, too, into the case
Well, Kid, what's your game
to include the other four players, who have come up to the table, still not taking chairs until Lancey and The Kid have chosen theirs
Though Lancey's question is purely ritualistic, they look to The Kid for his reply
don't mind stud poker if that's okay with you
got no objections to stud
(to the others) Gentlemen
Consulting the others is a formality, but all four of them -- Yeller, Shooter, Pig and Sokal -- nod or grunt or otherwise indicate assent
- across the room, he is indicating to The Shooter that he'd like a word with him before play begins
- He detaches himself from the group and sidles inconspicuously over to Bill
Tell The Kid  have a suite on the fifth floor
He can drop up during the breaks
Bedroom all for him any time he wants a nap
That's thoughtful of you, Bill
'm a thoughtful man
hope you are
The Kid gestures to Lancey to choose his seat
Lancey acknowledges the courtesy, glances at the window and picks himself a chair facing away from it
Privilege of age
Can't take the glare of the morning sun in my eyes
The Kid, following protocol, moves to a seat directly across from Lancey's
The Shooter takes his place at the table halfway between The Kid and Lancey, and pulls the twenty- five eligible packs of cards to him
You want to have the usual brandy and coffee on hand, Kid
Anything special for you, Lancey
Why, yes, Shooter
Creme de menthe frappe
Green
(glances around) You got that, Hoban
(to the table) Gentlemen, if there are no objections, 'm the dealer
These rooms have been contracted for, and there will be an ante of ten dollars per chair, per day
During the breaks for me, Old Lady Fingers has agreed to deal, but she don't care to be a player -- ' Do too care
to reveal Lady Fingers as she steps from among the spectators to a place behind Lancey
Can't afford to play, that's the real truth
Had a bad year and 'm way over my edge
Lady Fingers will get three dollars an hour from the ante, plus her room and food, and a five-minute break every hour
Gents
Fine, Shooter man
'Kay with us
If you don't see me when you need me, call room three-oh-eight
(taps Lancey's shoulder) You know who else ain't with us no more
Miriam, widow used to run the kitchen game to South Chi
Lost two month's Relief at blackjack, coal dealer cut her credit, and she froze in her bed
- The Kid has taken his roll from his pocket and is counting it out rapidly
The other players watch, interested to see how much he is putting out
After counting out one stack of thirty hundreds, he distributes the rest in stacks of twenties, tens and fives, folding each bill over once as protection against picking up more than one at a time
Gentlemen, this is a game of five- card stud poker
There is no limit
dead man has one half hour to raise his roll outside and get back in the game
The Kid has completed his count
- He takes the money from his satchel
Five grand
Nice, tidy sum
'll put out the same
to Yeller
swear  don't know what 'm doing sitting down with you titans, but maybe it's worth putting up five thousand for the educational value
to Pig as he brings out a roll and drops it casually in front of him
'll play with what  have in my pocket till  have to send out for more
Twenty-seven, twenty-eight hundred,  don't know
past The Kid to Sokal, who is counting out bills from an impressive roll
Five 's, 'm with it
Don't mean 'm goin' blow it all, though
to The Shooter, who is counting out a smaller stake than anyone
Last and certainly least -- He puts his money out without counting it, takes a deck of cards, rips the cellophane off it, takes the jokers and tosses them offhandedly to one side, not seeming to take aim
Heads turn as the cards sail through the air in unison, landing inside The Shooter's familiar hat, which is resting crown down on the mantelpiece
The spectators gape at the display of dexterity
He begins to shuffle and all eyes are upon him, not from suspicion but from pure admiration
He is in peak form, shuffling six times, once for each player and then slapping the cards down before Lancey, who is to the right of him, with an empty chair in between
- He waives his privilege of cutting with a barely perceptible nod
The Shooter acknowledges the compliment with the same sort of gesture
Then he begins to deal in his magnificently precise way, pitching each card so that it comes to a stop six inches in front of the player's money and in clear view of everyone at the table
- ' With Sokal in b
g
It is notable that as The Shooter completes dealing hole cards and switches to the first up card, there is no visible difference in the motion of his hands
He calls the cards as he deals them
Seven, nine, trey, nine, ace, and The Shooter guns up a ten
Ace bets
Ten dollars
Dealer folds
Call the sawbuck
- He looks at his hole card: an ace
'm in
' Call
' Call
The Shooter deals again
King to the seven, pair of nines, deuce to the trey, queen-nine, ace- eight
Nines bet twenty bucks
Each other player folds in turn
The Shooter pulls in the cards, and The Kid pulls in the seventy dollars
The Shooter shuffles and deals again
Queen, ten, king, four, ace again, and a king for The Shooter
Ace bets ten dollars King over
- They are perched on the back of a love seat at the far end of the room, with their feet on the arms
This gives them a view of the table through a pair of opera glasses they share, but they are far enough from it to be able to discuss the hands freely
Shooter won't stay on a king or an ace if there's another one showing
What's he have to have in the hole
Ten or better
With no other ten showing
The second round has been dealt
Sokal has a queen-eight, The Kid a pair of tens, Pig a king- seven, Lancey an ace- five
Yeller, like The Shooter, has folded on the first card
The Kid makes the same bet of twenty dollars, and the other three remaining players drop
New deck
Unhesitatingly, The Shooter pulls in the cards, separates them into four or five piles, and tears each pile in two
He glances around, and Hoban comes up behind him
The Shooter hands him the torn-up cards and unseals another pack, going through the same routine of throwing the jokers into his hat
( ) - It is around midnight, and there is a more settled look to the game; some of the players have removed their coats, and there is a good deal of smoke in the air
The Kid has a cup of coffee by him, presumably with brandy in it; Lancey has his frappe; Pig is drinking whiskey; the Shooter and Yeller have bottles of bear
It is the end of a hand
With about six hundred dollars in the pot, Pig, who has been called, turns over his hole card triumphantly
Aces over eights
(waits for a challenge, but the others turn their cards) Thank you, gents
(as he pulls in money, to Yeller) Be a laugh if the two champs ended up cleaned
- He barely notices Pig's remark
- He barely notices Lancey's reaction to Pig's remark
among the spectators, who also have a more settled look about them
There is a bar, attended by a uniformed  , and most of the people are drinking
We see in passing a couple go through the door to the bedroom and close it behind them
on the love seat as Bill rejoin Hoban on their perch
Any action
(shrugs) What do you expect first five or six hours
Still feeling each other out
Pig's ahead about a grand, Shooter maybe three hundred
( ) - Sokal gets a nine of clubs, The Kid a six, Pig a queen, Yeller a king, Lancey a jack, and The Shooter a four
' King bets
to show the players
There is less oral accompaniment to the betting now
King says twenty
Lancey calls, Shooter drops, Sokal calls, The Kid drops
In for twenty
(dealing) To the nine a ten, to the queen a seven, to the king a jack, and to the jack a jack
Pair of jacks will venture a hundred dollars
(who has the nine and ten of clubs showing) 'm in
(after studying the board) Up two hundred dollars
(folding) Leave it to the rich folk
- Lancey could be laying for him with three jacks
Pig don't think so
'  (
) Call the two hundred
Lancey puts in his money and so does Sokal
'm sticking
Shooter deals another round: an eight of clubs to Sokal, a second seven to Pig, a ten to Lancey
Possible straight flush, pair of sevens
Pair of jacks are still high
Check to the sevens
Likewise
(trying to be casual) Bet the size of the pot
Nine hundred and eighty dollars
In for nine eighty
'll play
- What's with Lancey
thought he'd raise with three jacks or drop with two pair
He probably thinks Pig's faking the queens
Anyhow, Doc's liable take them both with a straight or a flush
There is a good deal of suspense hanging on each card as The Shooter deals
Sokal gets a five of diamonds, and his disappointment is too great to conceal
Busted, no flush, no straight
Pair of sevens with a queen gets a nine
To the pair of jacks, a trey
(counting his money, trying to be calm) Pair of sevens will bet whatever got here
Twenty-four hundred bucks
'll call your twenty-four hundred -- - He watches Lancey, puzzled; this isn't what he had expected
'  (
) -- and raise you whatever  have left
The Kid relaxes; this is more the way he figured it
Lancey is completely calm
Pig is shattered, his whole world suddenly blown apart
Comes to fourteen hundred fifty dollars, Pig
Don't imagine you'll have any problem promoting that much in half an hour -- plus whatever you care to raise me
All eyes are on Pig, which doesn't make it any easier for him
He just sits there, his hands shaking
Fourteen fifty to the queens
You want to take your half hour, Pig
There is another long moment before Pig flips over his up cards
No, 'm out
Out of the game
He looks at Lancey with malevolence
Lancey turns over his up cards and tosses them in front of The Shooter
Pig suddenly lunges toward the cards, wanting a look at Lancey's hole card, but Lancey is too quick for him and pushes the cards into the pack The Shooter is assembling
(to Pig) You Tap City
Pig is suffering, weighing the advantages and disadvantages of making the dread admission
Finally he nods
The Shooter takes a ten dollar bill from his own stake, and the other four remaining players each add a ten
The Shooter pushes the money toward Pig
got a woman
thought you and Hilda were quits
We're back
The other players look at The Shooter to see if he is going to accept this statement at face value
He nods, that he does, and each man contributes another ten
The Shooter passes the second fifty to Pig
See you around, Pig
(ad lib) So long, Pig -- See you -- 'Night
(getting up) So long
him to the door
The spectators make room for him, no one saying anything
At the door, Pig turns back for his valedictory gesture
Good luck -- Kid
He goes out
- He has been rearranging his money, but Pig's words make his head jerk up and toward the door
to reveal the other players, who react in dismay to the breach of form
He shouldn't have said that
Not after taking Tap City from the table
His woman's been giving him a rough time
Wants him to quit and go square
At his age
Crazy
He wants to wish anybody luck, doesn't bother me
Personally,  don't figure The Kid needs it
Thanks, Lancey
With that, the tension is gone
But just to make sure, The Shooter pushes his chair back
know it's early, men, but what about taking a little break
( ) - , Melba fills a beer glass from a bottle and serves it to The Shooter
(to Melba) It always distresses me, a man reaching his middle years and still having no assurance of next week's income
know what you mean
like a man to have plenty of assurance
The Shooter's gaze wanders o
s
to  the objects of his attention, who are Lady Fingers, Lancey and The Kid
The two men would like to talk to each other, but Lady Finger's is monopolizing Lancey, and he doesn't want to offend her
Spider Man died kind of slow
First he give them a kidney, then his gall bladder, and then they taking his whole damn stomach
You remember Spider Man, run the dice table down at Turk's Club to Memphis
Who
Oh, Spider Man, sure, sure
He died kind of slow
The Shooter comes to Lancey's rescue
Need your help, Lady Fingers
to make arrangements for food and shelter
He whisks her away
Lancey and The Kid, finally facing each other alone, don't quite know how to begin
Good crowd
Yeah
Nice-looking broads
That's a fact
That was a pretty thing to watch what you done to Pig with those jacks
Thanks, Kid
From you, that's nice to hear
When he bet out first, he was ready to think you had them back to back
Even when he bet the size of the pot, he figured there was still a chance you were laying for him
But when you called him,  could see it in his eyes he thought you had jacks and tens, and  knew you had him hooked
You knew, did you
Before  raised
Oh, sure,  seen what you were pulling all along
Lancey is a bit taken aback by The Kid's confident assertion, but he manages a smile
You been to Miami, Kid
Not yet
Beautiful town, lot of loose money around
You ought to come down some time
You mean it
Sure, sure
Lot of room down there
Another spot you ought to work someday is Reno, Nevada
heard
You got to have nerves though
So much going on
Action everywhere you turn
You lose the feel of the cards when you're in so much action day in, day out
'd like to make it out there
There's different levels of action there -- you'd find yours, any kind you could ask for
generally stick to stud
Sure, sure, for eating money
But you know how it is,  like to lay off once in a while and try craps
Nothing serious --  don't even think of it as work
Oh,  do that
'll take a night off and shoot a little casino
Or even blackjack
Your age, you don't need a regular vacation every year
But me,  have to forget the grind for a couple of weeks
go to this place near Delray Beach, and the whole time  don't play anything but bridge
That's interesting
could go for bridge if there was a way to do it without partners
'm not keeping you from your woman, am
(after a slight hesitation) No
We're -- she's gone away for a while
We're not sure we're looking for the same thing
'm sorry to hear that
was hoping Christian would run with me and wouldn't try to make a big deal out of it
But she tried
Yeah, and now  don't know
don't figure a man can change his way because the way  see it a man's lucky he's got something going for him that he can hold on to
man can't change his way for a woman
Nooo, a man can't do that
been wondering if it isn't maybe a better idea not to look for a fixed thing
Just tie in to something nice when you're away from the action, and enjoy it, and let it wear itself out
(after a long moment) That's very interesting you should say that
You're pretty young to have figured things out already
Well she didn't understand how it was with me and --- (warmly) Between us
There ain't but a few people,  guess who would understand -- (as The Kid doesn't finish) Kid, you're the best stud man 've seen in 35 years of action
You know that
Well -- thank you
And when it comes to broads, which is getting to be an academic problem -- can look back now to the two or three  ever considered  might want to spend the rest of my life with, and you know what
like it
looking back on them, that is -- (then) always got a lot of companionship out of a good book
It's very educational, hearing what it's like for a man your age
Glad to be of help
And it's good we had this little talk so  know we can be friends regardless what happens
That sounds good to me
didn't think you was coming in at me like a grudge match
No room for any kind of emotion in a fair game of stud
learned that a long time ago
'  (
) Ready for some action, gentlemen
They look at each other and then exit
Lady Fingers is sitting in Shooter's place, rippling and shuffling the cards
Yeller, Sokal, and The Shooter are all either sitting at the table or standing near it
Lancey, followed by The Kid, returns to the table
It's a whole New Deal
Good hands all around
Prosperity for everybody
You're still good, Fingers
Getting crippled up, Lancey
Not many of the old gang left
You heard Whistling Sam was gone
No,  didn't hear
was the one got called to the morgue to identify him
don't suppose you seen anybody been run over by a twelve- ton bulldozer
No, can't say that  have
Don't go out of your way
( ) - Morning sunlight is streaming in
The Kid, facing the sun, wears his eyeshade
The Shooter has resumed the deal and now hands out last cards to Sokal, The Kid and himself
Bet the pot
Four hundred and twenty dollars
Fold
It's yours
Thanks, gents
Makes me exactly even
This kind of a game, that's a smart place to quit
(takes his money off the table) Just do the dealing, if that's all right with everybody
( ) It is later in the morning
Three players are left in the hand on the last card: Yeller with nothing higher than a jack, Lancey with a king-queen showing and Sokal with an ace- king
Ace-king is the high man
Shoot the works
(counts it out) Nine hundred and thirty bucks
'm over
(putting out the money) What have you got
(unhappily) Doesn't matter
If you can call me, you beat me
Ace-king high
(turning an ace) Ace-king-queen high
(to The Kid) had them both with a pair of fives
Winds it up for me, men
And  can't say it's been a pleasure
(despairingly) That one  was sure  could steal
Lancey has a built-in burglar alarm
'm also withdrawing from the field of battle, gentlemen
Settle for the seventeen hundred 've already dropped
Yeller pulls in the money in front of him
There is now about $19,500 left on the table, $11,500 in front of Lancey, $8,000 in front of The Kid
(to The Kid) Well, just the two of us
Yeah, just the two of us
Deal them, Shooter Man
( ) There is around $1,500 in the pot
Shooter deals an unhelpful card to Lancey's pair of aces, and a nine to The Kid's king- queen-ten
Cost you a grand
Compulsory call, Kid
The Kid turns up a jack and pulls in the money
( ) The last bet has been made and there is about $3000 in the pot
Lancey exposes his hole card
Two pair, jacks up
Kings up
He takes in the money
( ) There is $2500 in the pot
Lancey shows a pair of kings, The Kid an ace and three odd cards
The Shooter deals a nine to Lancey
He is watching The Shooter intently
'  - '
The dealing motion looks perfectly legitimate as The Shooter gives The Kid an ace
Lancey's hand reaches into the  to turn over his up cards
'  (
) Studded again
He takes the money in slowly, his eyes on The Shooter
Now the distribution of money has been reversed
The Kid has something under $12,000, Lancey something under $8,000
He avoids meeting The Kid's gaze
( ) - On the fourth card Lancey shows a pair of sevens, The Kid a pair of eights and a ten
Two thousand dollars
The Kid lifts his hole card and we see it is a ten
Call two thousand
He turns to watch The Shooter
'  - '
Again there is no indication of improper dealing as The Shooter gives Lancey an odd card and The Kid a ten, completing his full house
'  (
) Two thousand more
Take it
can't beat three sevens
(then as The Shooter's eyes flicker with surprise) 'd like a break to get some food and sleep -- 'm winners so it isn't up to me to say it but 'm saying it anyway
He exits
After a moment The Shooter follows
Lancey watches them go then rises, apparently still fresh and strong
Lady Fingers joins him
(pleasantly) My dear, that young man is a stud poker-playing son-of-a-bitch
Gettin' to you, Lancey
Lancey looks at her a moment, then smiles
(softly) Not yet he isn't
He moves through the crowd, then exits
: - '  -   & They are alone in the room
Shooter is uncomfortable and would like to be elsewhere but The Kid is standing in front of the closed door
Now, just what the hell are you trying to pull
(trying to bluff it) Nothing -- what are you talking about
The Kid grabs him and slams him against the wall
You, Shooter Man -- you been feeding me cards for an hour
(angry and ashamed) The hell  was
(he waits a brief moment then eases away from The Kid) Christ, Kid, even if  was you couldn't spot it -- 'm too good a mechanic for anybody to spot it
(grabbing him and slamming him against the wall again) But  was looking for it, Shooter -- four times you give me the cards need
(a little shrill) You seen it before often enough
One player draws four good ones
Never in a game when  been told ahead the dealer has a stake in my coming out on top
(slumping) My woman told you
She told me enough to make me start thinking
(almost pleading) Why should you bitch if  give you a little help
Why, you dumb bastard
-- You have to ask me why
(ready to hit him) could break you apart for what you've done
(backing off) Kid, you got to understand
It wasn't my idea -- Well who the hell's was it then -- Schlaegel
-- He's got the squeeze on me Kid and he's meaner than hell
He'll cut me up if  don't come through
(then) You think  wanted to deal a phony game
You think it don't mean something to me
never done a crooked thing before in my life
My ass bleeds for you -- Now you get straight on this
No fix
You come along straight or  blow it wide open
He's liable to kill me
He ain't goin' to do nothin' to you except pay off because 'm goin' to win
It is a hell of a chance to take
You got no choice
He ain't goin' to like it
(almost yelling at him) He ain't goin' to know
(then quietly) Shooter, 'm goin' to win this one -- win it my way -- and you ride with me or you're out, finished
ride with you
You better not forget it -- now beat it
need some sleep
Shooter looks at him, then moves towards the door
Tell Mr
Schlaegel  accept his offer to use the room
The Shooter goes out
The Kid crosses to the phone
(into phone) want to be called at 4 p
m
on the nose
For sure -- Thanks
' In the privacy of his room he shows how close he is to exhaustion
Wearily, he sits on the bed and begins to remove his shoes
Then, catching his reflection in the mirror, straightens
Not yet he isn't
But he damn well might
, '  -   - She is in the final stages of undressing
with her as she steps to The Kid's bedside and gets into bed with him
Having accomplished this without waking him, she speaks into his ear in imitation of a hotel phone operator
Good afternoon, sir
It's exactly four o'clock
He awakens in considerable confusion
Melba is amused by his difficulty in adjusting to his circumstances
It's really only about twenty-five to four
You can stay right where you are
don't want you to think 'm getting too personal, but you mind telling me how the hell you come to be here
You mean you don't remember last night
We drank all that champagne and you said "Let's get married right away," and we chartered a plane to -- Can it -- (then) Where's Shooter
locked the door
It's incredible the way you invariably worry about The Shooter
It's incredible the way you invariably don't
Worrying takes time and we don't have a lot
We're supposed to sit down again at half past four
Does it really matter so much to you now, that sense of obligation to The Shooter
(thinking about Shooter) got no obligations to The Shooter
(then to Melba) Or to you
Obligations are not what  have in mind
' He is shaving
Apparently much stronger but his hand is shaking
He looks at it
It steadies
After a moment he smiles a little
, ' is on the shower door as the  of running water ceases
The Kid can be seen indistinctly through the door
Reach me a towel
Melba, who is dressed again and applying her lipstick, comes into the , takes a towel from a rack and hands it to him after he opens the shower door
He gives himself a quick once-over with it, the secures it around his waist, steps out of the shower stall, and begins the process of shaving
Melba meanwhile finishes restoring her makeup
You any idea how much The Shooter has involved in this game of yours
If Schlaegel bet as much on me as heard,  guess he'd pay a nice piece of change to be sure  won
It's worse than that
Schlaegel staked him for three years
He has his hooks so deep in Shooter Man, he'll take out his liver when he pulls them out
The Kid stops shaving and looks at her
You asking me to go along with the fix
'm asking you to consider whether your ego is worth destroying another man's whole life
You're still working for him
On my time you're still working for him
What kind of switch is this
You criticize me for trying to chippie on him, then  get a little loyal and you're at me for that
No --  don't hold it against you
You wanting to make things right for him -- but this game  handle my way -- win, lose, or draw
There is a  on the door
Rolls and coffee for the hard-headed hero
to take in the view of the bedroom as she crosses it to the door, talking as she goes
Believe me Kid there is too much at stake for us to rely on your doing it on your own
She has paused at the door to finish her sentence
Now she unlocks and opens it -- to Christian
Melba is so taken aback she can't do anything but stand there holding the door open
The Kid, in the bathroom in f
g
, is similarly frozen in his tracks
After a moment Christian advances into the room
-
The scene as it looks to Christian is circumstantially incriminating
with her gaze from The Kid to the one mussed bed, to Melba
The faces and the silence of the two people are even more incriminating than the circumstances
Hello, Kid
Hello, Melba
(a pause) You said wait home 'til you let me know
Yeah, that's what  said
We took a break in the game to catch some sleep
Shooter sent his woman up here to wake me up
Yeah,  woke him up
It don't take much
No,  didn't find it any trouble
(awkwardly) Well, you children don't need me, that's for sure
See you downstairs
(to Christian) You, too, honey, right
'll be around if The Kid wants me
See you, Melba
Thanks
Por nada, as they say
It was nothing
She walks past  and a moment later comes the  of the door closing behind her
The Kid, who has moved into the bedroom, crosses to his clothes on a chair, and picks up his undershorts and trousers
He returns to the bathroom, using the door for partial concealment as he removes his towel and puts on his shorts and trousers
You been to the place
No, 've got my bag downstairs
Maybe 'll take it over later on tonight
How's your Mama and Papa
Fine
How's the game going
The Kid fastens his trousers and returns to the basin to give his face a last few strokes with the razor and wash off the soap
It's come to be just me and Lancey
He comes back into the bedroom to finish dressing
As his movement brings him fairly close to Christian, he realizes he hasn't kissed her, and repairs the omission before putting his shirt on
(after the kiss) was wondering
got my mind on the cards
know
And  don't want to rattle you
We got plenty to talk about, but it can all wait
Except  want to say this
came back because figured if it was going to work with us, it's silly me sitting home with Mama while you're playing your big game
mean if 'm any use to you at all, this is when it's most important
To The Kid preoccupied by the game and the fix, feeling both affection and guilt
The idea that she can be any use to him against Lancey is one he can't grasp
'm glad you came, Christian
You got as much right here as anybody
(then) More right,  should have said
Should you
Hell, yes
The change  come out with when  win this one, you're going to be the one to spend it
He moves toward the door
Eric -- (turning back) Look,  said 'm glad you came -- and that's all until  wrap this up -- 'm a poker player, remember
She looks at him
After a moment he exits
She follows
: It is evening
Lady Fingers deals a first up card to the two players
The Kid gets an eight, Lancey a jack
The eight'll try two bills
(turning his card) No stay
Lady Fingers scoops up the cards, shuffles them into the rest of the deck, submits it to Lancey for his cut, and deals them another two cards apiece -- all in the space of seconds
The Kid gets a queen, Lancey a nine
Two hundred
(turning his card) No stay
starts on Yeller, who is stretched out on the loveseat with his eyes closed and   to  Hoban, who sits at the observation post with the binoculars
Yeller speaks without opening his eyes
Anything
Naaa, Kid paired kings
He wins a hundred
on  a window, showing it is night outside; past a group of other spectators; past Bill, Shooter and Melba who watch the game grimly; and finally to the table, where The Shooter is dealing again
The Kid is down to his undershirt, and even Lancey has made a few concessions to comfort
The players have just been dealt their third cards
Christian moves up to stand behind The Kid
Queen bets another -note
(folding) Take it away
He looks up at Christian
Go read a magazine, honey
She hesitates
Then moves away
Lancey watches this
( ) - It is later at night
The magazine lies open on Christian's lap; she is staring absently into space
'  (
) All right, gents
'm declaring a break
The announcement rouses Christian from her reverie
Lady Fingers is in the dealer's chair
The two players look pretty weary
break
don't want a break
Well,  don't either
Deal
Lady Fingers puts down the deck
Picks up a new one
(snapping) Same deck is good enough
want a new deck
Alright, alright --  new deck then, Jesus
Deal
Lady Fingers looks at the two men for a long moment
Puts the cards down
You want to deal
Then deal them yourselves
'm going to the john
'm going to get something to eat, and 'm going to take a nap
You barracudas can snap all you want but at each other -- 'm taking a break and if you don't like it you can both go to hell
She turns and stalks off
Lancey and The Kid look at each other for a moment, then both grin
guess we been told
Looks that way
(rising) See you in about 3/4 of an hour, Lancey, right
Make it an hour
Old bones need a little more time to loosen up
(meaning it) Listen,  think it is amazing you've been able to keep going this long
As he heads for the door, Lancey reacts to this
Then stands and looks around the room
Groups of people stand in the shadows watching silently, not hostile but certainly not friendly
He is The Man but he is getting beat and nobody is sorry
After a moment he turns and leaves from a side door
to  on Christian as she stops The Kid by the door
(taking his hand) Eric -- (simultaneously) Your fan on the fifth floor wants you to have a bite with him
Alone
There's nothing to talk about
You better, Kid
You don't, you're only making worse trouble
Christian scans both their faces as they talk
concerned
If you think so
(to Christian) Sorry
What's wrong
Nothing, Nothing you have to worry about
'll see you later
He heads for the door
Christian looks after him
Get something to eat
: ' Bill and The Kid are sitting at a room-service table
Bill nibbles at some cheese and crackers while The Kid tackles a large steak
Felix, the chauffeur, stands in attendance on them
thought it would be better if you and  sat down together to see if we couldn't work out our differences
Felix
He motions to Felix, indicating a wine bottle on the table
Felix steps over and refills The Kid's glass
What  told The Shooter goes
Are you saying no before we've even discussed it
Am  to feel all my arguments will be wasted
The Kid just looks at him -- then returns to his meal
'll skip to the final argument
(then) More salad, perhaps
He makes a peremptory gesture to Felix, who springs forward to offer the salad bowl to The Kid
The Shooter will be back dealing when you start again
He will give you an occasional helpful card
That's an argument
That's a fact
'm coming to the argument
'll give you a fact
won't let it happen
Is that knife sharp enough
Felix
Felix jumps into action again
He moves to The Kid's side, reaches into a breast pocket and takes out a switch blade, which he clocks open an inch or two from The Kid's neck
It is an extremely ugly-looking and menacing weapon
See if it cuts better with that
Felix hands the knife to The Kid, who tries it on his steak
Sharp
Very
But it don't cut any ice with me
He jams the knife in the table and snaps off the blade
(rising) Not this time
He exits
As The Kid exits Christian is waiting for him
He moves down the corridor, preoccupied
She follows
Did you eat
No
(stops, looks at her irritated) Why not, for Chris sakes
Eric -- (moving away) You should eat something
(loudly, stopping) 've got to talk to you
He stops, looks at her
Talk
(fumbling) It's -- about us
What's going to happen
(interrupting) What's going to happen
What's going to happen for Chris sake is 'm going to win the game
(then more softly) You go back to the apartment, honey, this might take two more days
(flatly) If  go, 'm not going back to the apartment
If  go -- 'm just going
(after a long moment) Well, that's up to you, Christian
He looks at her a moment longer then moves up the corridor
She watches him, then turns
Standing in the open door some distance away are Schlaegel and Felix
: -  ' Shuffling the cards
enough to see his face as he looks across at The Kid
to a of The Kid, and then past a couple of spectators, including Christian and Melba, to Bill, whose eyes are on The Kid
Finally   back to The Kid
told you, Shooter --  won't go for it
- Both The Shooter and Bill are aware of a portentous note in The Kid's tone
What's up
The Shooter's not well
He didn't want to spoil the game, but he ought to be resting
He ought to be in the hospital
Well, we got Lady Fingers
Or we can deal ourselves
'm okay
What The Kid's talking about is nothing
It's just not important
It is to me
You want to kill yourself, do it on your own time
Lancey looks from The Kid to The Shooter, sensing that there may be something more behind this, but not knowing just what
got to go along with that, Shooter
Lady Fingers
You ready
- Rising from her chair
Like Eddie the Dude said on his deathbed, 'm as ready as 'll ever be
( ) -   - The four cards showing are the ace, ten and two little clubs
As    we also have time to note The Kid's stake
He is still ahead
Lancey counts out five hundred dollars from his stake, leaving about thirteen thousand, and puts it into a pot that already contains around a thousand
can't persuade myself you have the flush
The Kid turns up the jack of clubs
Now  can
The Kid pulls in the money
( ) -   -  - Both men are showing the strain
Perhaps Lancey the most as he appears to be consistently losing
Showing are two nines and two odd cards
'  (
) 'm going to pay the price to look at that third nine
The kid turns up another nine and reaches for the money
'  (
) Caveat emptor
New deck, please
( ) - He shows a pair of eights and two odd cards against Lancey's pair of queens
He takes another look at his hole card, and we see that it is of no help to him
Pair of eights bets an even thousand dollars
They are both sitting on the back of the loveseat now
The binoculars pass from one to the other
Both men are tense over the growing excitement of the game
Ten bucks and my notoriously fallible instinct tells me the boy is bluffing this time
Mark it
to the other four remaining spectators: Christian, Melba, The Shooter and Bill
They are close enough to see the cards but too close to discuss them
The kid has almost half the money in front of him now, and is playing with increasing assurance and pressure
(turning his cards) 'm not that curious
(excitement in his voice) The Kid is pushing it and making it stick
to the other four spectators as they react to The Kid's successful streak
(in a low voice) He's getting to him
And it looks that way
Lancey appears old and unsure
The Kid sharp and cold
young barracuda moving in for the kill
in close to Christian as she tries to catch The Kid's eye
Thinking she has it, she smiles her encouragement
He looks right at her and doesn't seem to see her
Lady Fingers has dealt the first up cards of a new hand, and Lancey is high
Two hundred
And up five
Fold
- Amid the growing excitement and tension she is a complete outsider
( ) The Kid shows two jacks and two odd cards; Lancey a pair of aces and two odd cards
Lancey puts about eight hundred dollars into the pot
Betting the jack isn't there, Kid
The Kid exposes his hidden jack
, Greed and an almost vicious satisfaction marks their faces as they watch Lancey falter
The Shooter whispers to Bill just loud enough for the girl to hear
We're in --  think he's got him
Christian looks at them, then at The Kid
Hesitates a moment then suddenly gets to her feet and starts for the door
Only Melba notices her, and even she doesn't have time to question her
Christian to the suite entrance, where she picks up her bag then turns to look back at the table
The place where Christian was sitting is right in his line of vision but he hasn't observed her departure
- She goes on out the door
- The second dawn of the contest is near at hand
The room, continuously lived in for so long by so many people, is a shambles of dirty glasses and plates, empty bottles, full wastebaskets and ash trays, and frayed people
At the poker table, Lady Fingers is dealing a new hand
jack and a ten
Jack bets
in close enough for us to see the cards
Lancey has the jack of hearts, The Kid the ten of clubs
Jack is willing to wager two hundred dollars
The Kid takes his first look at his hole card
- It is the queen of hearts
And up five hundred
Lancey looks at him a long moment
His face pale and shaken
The Kid is beating him
Pushing -- buying -- always pressing and Lancey knows he is losing one hand at a time, not badly but consistently and inevitably
His age and fatigue are a strong handicap for the long pull
Then his face settles as if he had come to a decision
He smiles lightly summoning some last reserve of strength, almost as if he knows this will be the last hand, win or lose
Call your five hundred and five hundred more
(after a brief hesitation) Call
Fifty to one hundred says Lancey paired his jacks
Mark it
Lady Fingers deals the ten of diamonds to The Kid, giving him a pair, and the ten of hearts to Lancey
Pair of tens
Jack, ten of hearts
Five hundred
Your five hundred -- and up one thousand
The raise is a surprise
The Kid's eyes go up to study Lancey's face, even though he knows what a futile effort that is
Fifty to seventy-five he's got the jacks wired
Mark it -- Could be a high heart
Queen's the best, but that old man can be cocky with an ace or a deuce
'Specially having one of The Kid's tens
One thousand to the tens
Call
(dealing) third ten, and a nine of hearts to the ten, jack
The Kid, Lancey, Shooter, Melba, Schlaegel, Yeller, Hoban and others as they realize this could be the big hand
He'll run
He's beat on the board anyway you look at it
Even if he has the jacks it is better than eight to one against improving
He won't run and  don't think he's got the jacks
think he's going for the flush
(after a moment) Two thousand, five hundred dollars
Lancey looks at him, then at the cards
The moment stretches
(finally) Two thousand, five hundred dollars to the three hearts
Lancey looks at her
His face briefly showing his anger
The Kid notices this and reacts
(finally, casually) Reasonable bet
Two thousand five hundred
(he counts out the money to Lady Fingers) Deal them
(knowing this is it) He's going for it and The Kid's got him
He's going all the way
(dealing) queen of diamonds to the three tens
(a note of excitement in her voice) And an eight of hearts to the possible flush
Possible straight flush
Three tens bet
The Kid checks the amount of money in front of him
They exchange a quick look of satisfaction, and then their eyes go back to the cards
They each take a quick turn with the binoculars
If The Kid bets into the flush he's filled up with a queen in the hole
If The Man has a flush or a straight, he goes under
(then) But not with both
He looks at his hole card
It is still the queen of hearts
He has a full house, which has to be the winning hand unless Lancey had the audacity to bet out with a jack-seven of hearts, and to raise The Kid with a jack-ten-seven
Bet what's in front of me
Make it fifty-four hundred bucks
He counts out all his money except a few smaller bills
Reacting
He takes his time before he responds
Fifty-four hundred bucks is a nice piece of money
(counting it out) see the bet and raise sixty-seven hundred
Slowly and deliberately, revealing nothing in his face, he reaches into his breast pocket and takes out a slim wallet and begins to let the bills flutter out on the table
The Kid looks at him frozen
Bill hisses softly into The Shooter's ear
Kid has him, doesn't he
But The Shooter, like the Kid, is white-faced and frozen by the raise
They crowd in close to the table: Hoban, Yeller, Bill, The Shooter, and Melba
(after a long moment) 'm taking my half hour to raise my stake
declare a thirty-minute break
Leave your cards and money on the table
The game will start again at five forty-five
'll take your marker, Kid
can raise it
know you can
Long as you know
(he raps the table) -- Call
(turns up a heart seven) Straight flush to the jack -- That's $6700 you owe me, Kid
- There is nothing to be gained from a poker face now, and he reacts with a stunned expression in which all the accumulated strain and fatigue is beginning to show
among the spectators: Hoban and Yeller, who are sorry for The Kid and admiring of Lancey; Bill, who is all the more angry at his defeat because his hopes were up; The Shooter, who is a very unhappy man; and Melba, whose anger at the Kid is balanced by her fear of Schlaegel and what will happen to The Shooter and possibly to her
Lancey pulls in the money while The Kid stares at him dumbly
Lady Fingers riffles the cards
New deck
Are you playing, Kid
You got a half an hour to raise your stake
No -- 'm through
(formally) Gentlemen, this game is over
You're one hell of a poker player, Kid
That was a rough hand
Thanks
What's the tab for the whole show
As he settles up, the   The Kid to his brandy bottle
As he pours himself a slug, Melba and Shooter join him
You had to do it, didn't you -- you had to go for it your own way
(then, as The Kid doesn't answer) Well, sonny,  hope you learned something
know we sure as hell did
Where's Christian
She's gone
She's got too much sense to stick with a two bit loser
Shut up
(then:) Sorry, Kid
Yeah
(then:) should have known he had it, Shooter Man
walked into it
(trying to grin as Schlaegel and Felix move up) Well, Kid, it's like  said -- you just wasn't ready
(to The Shooter) Are you ready, Shooter Man
We're having a meeting and  suggest you join us
Shooter looks at him a moment and nods, and taking Melba by the arm, moves toward the door followed by Felix
Why me -- 'm not part of this
(jerking her forward) Oh, yes you are -- you and your big mouth -- you're part of it all right
He's right, my dear
Now run along with Felix
We're going to have a long talk about that big mouth of yours
Melba starts to protest, but Felix jerks her out the door
Shooter hesitates, then follows
Schlaegel turns to The Kid
was wrong
figured you for brains
But you're a loser, Kid
You had a chance to play with grownups and you ran
(then, as Lancey and Lady Fingers approach) They weren't playing your game
They were playing mine
Think about that while you find a place to hide
But hide good, Kid -- because  got a message for you and 'm going to see it delivered
The Kid looks at him, looks at Lancey and Lady Fingers, wondering about what Schlaegel has said, angry about it
Any time
Schlaegel nods, moves to the door
Lancey and Lady Fingers join The Kid
Never thought 'd see the day
You raising tens on a lousy three-flush
Gets down to what it's all about, doesn't it
Making the wrong play at the right time
(sharply) That's what it's all about
(then, as Lancey looks at him and doesn't answer) You were crazy -- odds are three hundred to one against
(after a moment) don't play a percentage game play stud poker my way
And  got the money and you got the questions
Figure that out
(then, not unkindly) You're good
But as long as 'm around, you're second best, Kid
and you might as well learn to live with it
The Kid looks at him and doesn't answer
Look me up if you're in Miami after Christmas
Stillson Hotel
He smiles his very pleasant smile and goes out the door
Lancey stops surrounded by a crowd of admirers offering their congratulations
The Kid watches for a moment then takes a long drink out of the bottle and eases through the crowd and out the door
as The Kid moves down the hall and enters the elevator
as he moves through the almost deserted lobby into the street
- of the Kid walking alone through the city
During the above there is an impression someone is following him
' He turns a corner and there is a man blocking his path
Suddenly three men move in behind him
He turns, trapped
The men are four of the original seven players he hustled in the opening scene
: During the progression of the game first one, then two, then all four men will be included among the observers
Always in the background, never positively identified
Their presence should be felt if not recognized
So it ain't Eric Stone, from the foundry
It's the Cincinnati Kid King of the stud poker players
No -- not the King -- not much of anything right now
(moving towards him) We'll start with giving you back what you gave me
He moves toward The Kid
(
) Eric -- The men hesitate
as Christian gets out of a taxi
(as she moves toward them) Tell her good-bye, sport
You ain't going any place
know that
He crosses to Christian
Are you all right
'm fine
(then) Weren't you going to say good-bye
said good-bye
Yeah,  guess you did
(then) You don't know if  won or lost do you
No -- it doesn't really matter
(then after a long moment) love you, Kid -- and it's not enough
Yeah,  know
(calling) Listen, Lady, it's coming on the morning rush
got to have one fare after another or 'm behind for the day
Christian doesn't answer
She looks at The Kid for a long moment, then turns and goes
He watches her
She enters the cab and it leaves
The Kid just stands there
Danny and the others move up around him
The Kid ignores them
After a moment Danny swings from behind and knocks him to the pavement
He lies there stunned for a moment
They look down at him
Then he comes up
He flattens two in the process of being badly beaten
They leave him
as the city awakens
Finally, he stirs, stands and walks away
