rich, cultured, authoritative voice offers: / This is the problem
This is what's wrong with America
The war footage multiplies by twenty: a stack of TVs with price tags dangling from the knobs behind a display window
/ It's gotten so big you can't find your way
People on the sidewalk, out of respect or fear, part to let Frank and Bumpy and Bumpy's German shepherd pass
The corner grocery's a supermarket
Candy store's a MacDonald's
And this place

Where's the personal service
Does anybody work here
Inside, the emporium is vast, with aisles that seem to stretch off into infinity
The TVs give way to a display window full of Japanese stereo componentry
What right do they have cutting out the suppliers, pushing all the middlemen out, buying direct from the manufacturer - Sony this, Toshiba that, all them Chinks - putting Americans out of work
He's not really asking Frank, so Frank doesn't answer
What am  supposed to do with a place like this, Frank
Who am  supposed to ask for, the assistant manager
(pause) This is the problem
This is the way it is now: You can't find the heart of anything to stick the knife
Bumpy stops before a display of cameras and stares in
They're all pointed at him as a pain grips his chest and he sinks to his knees
Frank kneels down
What is it
Bumpy seems unable to speak, looks to Frank confused
Somebody call an ambulance
But the store suddenly seems empty
Frank yells into the emporium but can't be heard above the Muzak and the cash registers ringing up sales Bumpy will never see a piece of
Looking up at Frank, Bumpy manages weakly - Forget it, Frank
No one's in charge

The Governor has come down
The mayor of New York - its Chief of Police and Commissioner - sports and entertainment luminaries - white Bentley pulls up, disgorging Jackie Fox - the original Superfly - and his entourage
With his trademark tinted Gucci glasses on, he happily poses for anyone with a camera - including the Feds - before going inside

He was a Great Man, according to the eulogies
giving man
man of the people
No one chose to include in their remembrances the word most often associated with Ellsworth Bumpy Johnson: Gangster
Sitting off by himself in Bumpy's elegant garden apartment, heretofore his private sanctuary, Frank surveys the mourners circling the place like vultures: Tango Black, a huge brute, scavenging the catered food and tended bar
Jackie Fox, surrounded by his ever-present coterie of sycophants
Albert Tosca, an elegant Italian capo, and an underling, Rossi, at the bar
White wine, please
white man who looks like a banker - and is - sits down next to Frank
How you doing, Frank
All right
What a loss
(Frank nods) How are you otherwise
Things okay financially

It feels unseemly to him to be talking about money here
He watches Tango carelessly set a watery glass of ice on an antique inlaid chess table
Bumpy set something up for you
Frank excuses himself without an answer, crosses to where Tango left the glass, and sets it on a coaster
Hey, Frank, get me an ashtray while you're at it
Bumpy's German shepherd watches as Frank reaches into his jacket, revealing a gun nestled in its shoulder holster
He takes out a handkerchief, wipes the condensation dry, opens a drawer and removes an ashtray
He holds it out to Tango - who isn't sure it's not a dare and decides to wander off
know you're hurting, Frank
So am
Frank sits back down with Charlie Williams, an older dope man
You going to be all right
Yeah
'm sure Bumpy never told you, but he made me promise, anything ever happened to him, 'd make sure you didn't go without
'll be fine, Charlie
Half the people here owed Bumpy money when he died lot of money
If they think 'm going to forget to collect, they're wrong
That's the spirit
Go get them
On the , over archive film and photographs of crime figures from the 1940's and `50's, the opinion is offered that Bumpy's death "marks the end of an era

On this side - a sledgehammer gripped in Richie's fist, on the move, suddenly fills the frame
You know the Number 1 fear of most people isn't dying; it's public speaking
They get physically ill
They throw up
And that's what you want to do for a living
don't like being like that
want to beat it
Armed with the sledgehammer, Richie and his partner - Javy Rivera - come past a seedy motel office where a  shows another report about Bumpy Johnson

Takes a subpoena out of another pocket
Who's going to do this
He knows me, he'll take it from me
've known him since high school
Just throw it in, he doesn't take it
That's good service
They reach a particular motel room door
Rivera knocks
The door opens the length of a chain, revealing a wise guy in an undershirt, who, when he sees the subpoena, start to close the door - Throw it - As Richie flings the subpoena in, the door slams on his hand
He wails in agony, tries to shoulder it open, hears the dead bolt lock on the other side, feels Campizi's teeth bite into his fingers, watches his blood run down the frame
Down - Richie hangs down from his hand as the sledgehammer swings past his head shattering the door - 8   /

The wise guy - Campizi - hurries for the bathroom, slams the door
This one's hollow and the detectives more easily break through it - Campizi tries to climb out the bathroom window
Richie grabs him, throws him into the shower stall, taking the plastic curtain down with them, smearing it with blood as Richie beats at him before Rivera can pull him off

would never slam a door on your hand
Knowingly
You bit my fuckin hand - Richie lunges at him, hits him again with his injured hand - which hurts Richie more than it does Campizi
The paramedics manage to pull him away
What can we do, Richie
You don't want to do this
For old times sake, what can we do
Who do you want
Who can  give you
You want Big Sal's bookie
You want his accountant
'll give him to you
Richie regards him a moment
policy ring's accountant wouldn't be bad
He glances back to his paramedic dabbing at his bloody hand, and notices she's not bad-looking
She smiles back

It's impossible to tell if they're cops or gangsters
Legend:   New York City 11
-   -                  11 One of the same undercover cops - Detective Trupo - scribbles a signature and badge number different from the one on his gold shield lying next to the voucher requesting evidence needed in court
He pushes the voucher under a sign - "All Handguns and Narcotics Before 10am Next Window" - to a clerk who takes it past floor-to-ceiling shelves covered with files, plastic bags bulging with handguns, knives and gambling receipts
Bulkier items - like shotguns and baseball bats - lie unwrapped with dangling tags
The clerk reaches a chain-link cage where the most valuable items are locked up - narcotics, pornography, cash - checks the voucher against tags, takes down an old green suitcase

He climbs out, crosses to a warehouse with the suitcase as the other three Princes of the City follow from another car, cradling grocery bags

-                                              13 Trupo snaps the suitcase open revealing five half-kilo bags of uncut heroin in clear plastic bags
The other cops pull from the grocery bags: a Pyrex mixing bowl, flour sifter, boxes of milk-sugar, latex kitchen gloves, a medical scale, and yellow baggies
Hands peel back the distinctive black and green "evidence" tape on the clear plastic bags
Dump the heroin into twenty yellow baggies
half-kilo of lactose is poured into each of the now-empty property room bags
Now just enough for the reagent test
He removes one tablespoon of heroin from each of the baggies, and the now-almost-heroin-free powder is mixed through the flour sifter, poured back into the clear bags, the tape resealed, the bags returned to the suitcase

-                                           14 The suitcase and   "heroin," and some weapons and money, have been arranged on   an evidence table with the care of a Macy's display window
Trupo - the officer in charge of the case - watches the jury   files in - 15

Trupo climbs out of his Shelby with a sports bag, crosses to the Lincoln, climbs in back where an Italian wise guy - Rossi - sits
Trupo unzips the bag revealing the recut heroin - in the yellow plastic

They basically control the market with it
What the fuck has happened to the world, Frank
Fuckin crooks
Rossi, who looks more like a middle-aged accountant than the Italian dope supplier he is, makes two espressos
Sad about Bumpy
Behind Frank, a  airs a report by Walter Cronkite on the heroin problem among GIs in Vietnam
Things are never going to be the same in Harlem
The girls, the clubs, the music - walk down the street, nobody bothers you because Bumpy's making sure of it

middle- aged waitress appears when he's done, picks up his plate and refills his coffee
Thank you, Charlene
Last one
It's all right with me, Frank, you can stay all day if you want, but  wouldn't
It's nice outside
Then maybe 'll have to go for a walk
Just cause you said so
She smiles and leaves
Frank pours some sugar in his coffee
Someone taps on the window and he looks up, sees two servicemen - one in uniform - one he recognizes

Thank Frank

The servicemen start cooking up the dope
How's Nate
You seen him
1 All the time
Nate is everywhere
He's good
Got himself a club now
Where, Saigon
1 Bangkok
2 don't think he's ever coming home
Regarding the dope as the servicemen shoot it up - You're gonna have to boot it a couple times
Cops keep cutting it, selling it, cutting it - 1 don't want to say anything cause the price is right - but the shit in Nam is way, way, way, way, way - He begins to nod out before he can finish the sentence

man carrying a grocery bag comes out and Campizi ducks lower in the seat
That's him
Newsboy Moriarty's mob accountant puts the grocery bag in the trunk of a car, climbs in behind the wheel

To Campizi - All right
Get lost
Get out
Campizi slinks out of the car
Richie and Rivera follow after Newsboy Moriarty's accountant's car
27
-                                27 They tail the car into a lot, park and watch the accountant leave his car and get into another car that's parked there
We gonna stay with him or the car
Whatever they do, they'll have to decide quick
Let's see who comes for the car
28
-  -                               28 All the other cars are gone
Rivera climbs into Richie's with coffee and a Coke in a bag, hands him the can
Think he made us
Richie doesn't know
Glances at his watch
Cranes in his seat to look behind them
You called for the warrant
Where are they
just called
called and walked back here and ten seconds has gone by
Richie watches an attendant lock up, listens to the street lamps buzz, grows impatient
Indicating the other car: We saw him with the slips, Javy
You saw policy slips
You saw grocery bags
You don't know what's in them
() 13
28   :                                                         28 Yes,  do, and so do you, don't give me that bullshit - What's the rush
Half an hour the warrant'll be here - got night school
Guess you're going to miss it
(Rivera sips at his coffee; then:) You know, what you were saying before - about throwing up in front of people - money will take that feeling away
Not when it's less
Less than what
Than what  make now
No lawyer on earth makes less than a cop
They do in the Prosecutor's Office
Three thousand less
You're fuckin kidding me
Richie isn't kidding
Rivera stares at him like he's crazy
Richie checks his watch
He's waited long enough
Fuck this - Richie - Richie gets out, opens the trunk, grabs a Slimjim and bolt cutters, cuts through a gate chain and strides to the accountant's car, Rivera following
Richie trips the passenger door lock and pulls at the trunk release, and, as he comes around back to search it - () 14
28   :                                                       28 Check inside
Rivera may as well; the damage to the case, if there is one anymore, is done
He crawls inside the car to look under the seats and in the glove compartment
Gravely - Javy
Richie's staring into the trunk like there's a body inside
Rivera comes over, takes a look, sees it's money: stacks of it rubber-banded together, spilling from grocery bags - more than either of them has ever seen
As the trunk closes - 29
/ '  -  -                   29 Richie and Rivera sit in their car in silence, staring out at the car with the money in it
Eventually - This isn't a couple of bucks
It's the same thing
In principle
We're talking about principle
Richie, a cop who turns in this kind of money says one thing: He'll turn in cops who take money
We'll be pariahs
We're fucked either way
Not if we keep it
Only if we don't
Then we're fucked, you're right
But not if we keep it
(more to himself) Yes, we are
Goddamn it, did we ask for this
Did we put a gun to someone's head and say, Give us your money
Cops kill cops they can't trust
We can't turn it in
They regard each other again in silence

-  -                     30 As a police captain counts the stacks of money, Lou Toback, Richie's superior from the prosecutors office, walks in, his night out interrupted by this emergency
He crossed to where Richie and Rivera sit alone in a corner
Quietly: How much
Nine hundred and eighty thousand
What happened to the rest
It's a joke but isn't funny, not even to Toback
He regards his men who turned it in, then the other cops in the place - who are watching them and the money being counted
Toback walks over to the captain, and, quietly: What're you doing counting this in front of everybody
Are you out of your fuckin mind
Take it into a room
Now
Richie's glance to Rivera says, You're right, we're fucked
31   /
- -                     31 As Richie leaves alone, he's aware of all the eyes on him - knowing the other cops' looks don't signify awe or respect, but contempt and fear, like Rivera predicted
Neither will ever be trusted again
He climbs into his car, drives off
32
-  -                                      32 Tango and his bodyguard come in and approach Frank's table where he reads the morning paper as he eats breakfast
Didn't you see the jar, Frank
think you walked right past it
Frank ignores him, forks at his eggs, eats
Tango sits
The money jar
On the corner
What got to do, put a sign on it
Frank indicates that he would answer if his mouth wasn't full
He swallows finally, but then only reaches for his coffee cup to take a sip, further irritating Tango
() 16
32   :                                                        32 Bumpy don't own 116th Street no more, Frank
Bumpy don't own no real estate in Harlem no more
'm the landlord now and the lease is twenty-percent
Frank dabs at his mouth with a napkin and gives Tango a look that says that won't be happening
Then don't sell dope, Frank
Get a fuckin job
You need a job
You can be my driver, drive me around, open my door, yes, sir, no sir, where to, sir, right away, Massa Johnson, sir
Right now Tango is dead
No doubt about it
On the surface, though, Frank remains cool
Twenty percent
Of every dollar
Every , every truckload, every girl, every ounce
In the jar
Twenty percent's my profit
If 'm giving it to you then what am  doing
Twenty percent puts me, and everyone you know, out of business, which puts you out of business
(reaches for his breakfast check) There are ways to make money legitimately, and then there's this way
Not even Bumpy took twenty percent
Bumpy's fuckin dead
Frank regards Tango a moment, gets up, takes out his money clip, covers the check on the table with a five, peels off a $1 bill from the clip, tosses it down in front of Tango
There
That's twenty-percent
As he turns and leaves, Tango watches after him

'm sorry
don't know, Richie
It couldn't be avoided
Next weekend 'll be able to take him
She regards him with a weary look, but he's looking over at one of the other - better-looking - moms in the park
'm moving
He looks back, not sure he heard right
What
Where
To the St
Regis, what do you care
(pause) My sister's
Your sister's
In Vegas
He glances away to a sound: shattering glass
Some teen- agers breaking bottles on the ground
You can't move to Vegas

Leave him with you

The teenagers ignore him
He tries to ignore them, but it's hard with the constant noise
No court will allow it for one thing
won't allow it
You
When am  supposed to see my son
Last weekend
Their son glances over at them
Richie looks over at the teenagers again breaking bottles, then back to Laurie
Laurie, you can't raise a kid in Las Vegas
Oh, like this is a good environment
Around your friends
There are less creeps in Vegas
What's he going to grow up to be in a mobbed up place like that
What are you thinking
'm thinking - Richie - of him
Goddamn it - The noise of the glass is driving him crazy
He strides over to the teenagers, who look at him like, What are you gonna do, old man, it's four against one
told you nice to shut the fuck up
Now 'm gonna kill you
He pulls out his gun and aims it at one of them, then the others

Dope being smoked
Dope being shot

His eyes follow an Army Master Sergeant, moving among the tables as if checking on the 's well being
But at some, his hand takes money, leaves in its place packets of powder
The Sergeant feels eyes on him and glances up, catching Frank watching him from across the room
He squints through the smoke at the figure at the table in the shadows, and, in a kind of shock, more to himself - Frank -

The general regards one of his men

Richie throws the phone
The paramedics stare at him
You got no back-up
Why is that
The only other person who would know the answer to that is Rivera, who just shakes his head in despair
Bandage his head
Detective
he's dead
know he's fucking dead
Bandage his head, clean him up, put him on a gurney and prop it up so he's sitting
And open his eyes

Step back, injured man coming out
Let them do their job and he'll be all right
Ma'am
Excuse me
Step back
Sir
Please
The people step back when they see the victim on the gurney: tubes in his nostrils,  in his arm, eyes open
Before they can look any closer, he's put in the ambulance
As it pulls out, siren wailing, Richie leads Rivera safely away - A60
-                   A60 They cross through an alley near the Projects and Rivera finally breathes a sigh of relief
Thank you - The words aren't out of his mouth before Richie shoves him up against a car

Money spills out

Where'd this come from
What
That's my money
've never taken dirty money in my life
You lying piece of shit - Maybe the occasional gratuity
Like anybody else
You're going to tell me that's wrong
Yeah
No, it isn't
It's part of the salary for getting shot at
For that, certain courtesies are shown
In gratitude - Richie, disgusted with him, lets go of him
Rivera is embarrassed, almost crying, pleading - discount on a , a Doughboy in the backyard, a new dress for your girlfriend maybe once a year
'm talking about not living in fucking poverty
You want to call that wrong, call it wrong
It's wrong
Then goddamn it, pay me fifty grand a year, you son of a bitch
Pay me what deserve for getting shot at
No
Fine
Next time four guys come into your place with sawed-off shotguns, you take care of it
You robbed him, and then you shot him, and  helped you get out of there
How many more you shot

Fuck you, you make that kind of accusation against your own kind
And you know why
He takes out his car keys, turns to leave
Comes past Richie who grabs his arm and pushes the sleeve up exposing a line of puncture scabs and scars
You're a disgrace
'm a leper
Because  listened to you and turned in a million fucking dollars
You know who'll work with me after that
Same as you
No one
Richie squeezes Rivera's hand around the car key
Don't look down there
Look here

The others aren't as sure

Frank, at the head of the table, clearly loves having them all here

What matters in business is honesty, integrity, hard work, loyalty, and never forgetting where you came from
For reasons his brothers can't imagine, Frank empties all sugar from the container onto his plate
You are what you are and that's one of two things
You're nothing
or you're something
Understand what 'm saying
The brothers nod tentatively, stare at the now-empty glass container
Frank wipes his mouth with a napkin, gets up
'll be right back

didn't    see nothing in it
The fuck you want, Frank - Before the last word is out of Tango's mouth, Frank's got a gun pressed against his forehead
Silence
Everyone backs away - the bodyguard, too
Tango's girl pulls her arm from his and takes off
Eventually - What're you going to do, boy
Shoot me in broad daylight
In front of everyone
It's as if life on the street has stopped
No one moves; everyone is looking at Frank; maybe that's what he wants
As Tango laughs at the thought - Yeah, that's right
Frank pulls the trigger and the big man falls back like someone hit with a board
Frank stands over him and empties the gun in his chest, the shots echoing down the street
Then it's quiet again
Everyone's still looking him, but Frank doesn't run
Instead, he calmly reaches into Tango's suit pocket, takes out a money clip thick with cash, drops it in the "jar" and sets it next to the body
For the cops
Should be enough
Frank returns to the diner and sits back down, ignoring the astonished stares from his brothers and everyone else in the place
Tries to remember where he was in his lecture as he tucks the napkin back in his shirt collar
That basically's the whole picture right there

Attorney
No one else
No
Hoover knows better than to mix his men with dope
Too much temptation for the feeble-minded
Though he's not in much of a position to refuse the assignment, Richie still isn't convinced it's a good idea
Toback levels with him - Richie, a detective who doesn't have the cooperation of his fellow detectives can't be effective
You know why  don't have it
Doesn't matter
No, they're all on the take and 'm not and it doesn't matter to anyone

Sure
Don't worry about it
Thank you

As the guy enters the place, Spearman's car stops long enough for Richie to climb out, and continues on
Richie crosses the street, tries to see who the guy is talking to inside, but he's just buying a cup of coffee to go
Spearman's car turns the corner to circle around the block
As soon as it's gone, the man emerges from the restaurant with the coffee and walks straight at Richie who has to double back quickly not to be seen Richie sees a delivery truck double-parked, guys unloading crates
Hears a horn and knows it's must be Spearman stuck on the side street
The mechanic starts his truck
Desperate not to lose him (and his money), Richie hurries over to a taxi stopped at a light, flashes his badge
Get out
What
Get the fuck out of the car
The driver realizes the man outside his taxi is crazy and tries to get his window rolled up
Reaching in, Richie gets his arm stuck, pulls at the lock, yanks the door open, drags the driver out, breaking the cabbie's arm, and jumps in
He swings the cab into opposing lanes to get around traffic, screeches around the corner, glimpses the truck far up ahead - guns the engine, flies through a red light, glances at his mirror at the cars that just missed him almost colliding - The truck turns up ahead, and Richie barrels through another red light, turns the corner and keeps the truck, a couple car-lengths ahead - in sight

Richie detours into an alley as they enter the restaurant
Richie peers in at the restaurant kitchen through a grimy basement window
Watches Trupo and his  detectives burst in, guns drawn
They rough everybody up, get some down on the floor
One detective gathers the money and stuffs it in a bag
Another gathers the dope
The mechanic tries to protest and Trupo slaps him down with his pistol
Richie keeps watching as the  cops arrest no one - but take the dope and the money (Richie's money) - and stride out as abruptly as they appeared, like bandits
As they come past Richie - That's my money

What money
Richie shows them his Bureau of Narcotics
The bills are sequenced and registered with the Essex County Prosecutors Office
All begin with CF3500
Take a look
One of them checks some of the bills and sees he's right

Meeting with his accountant, or lawyer, dropping in on one of the several office buildings he owns

Not your typical day in the life of a dope man, Richie
Neither was Bumpy Johnson's and he owned Harlem

His driver
That's a little far-fetched
Is it
Everything he does, he does like Bumpy
Bumpy never wore a chinchilla coat in his life
We haven't seen that again
That apparently has been retired to the closet

-                                         193 Frank and Charlie look on as Ana throws the bouquet
She's the most beautiful bride  ever saw, Frank
wish Bumpy could've met her
wish she could've met him

-  -                      194 Looking at the Lucas Table of Organization - What do you got on him you can use in court
Because this isn't it
You try this without informants and powder, no one's going to jail
Won't get any informants
Not inside
It's like a Sicilian family
Like he's structured his own family the same way to protect himself
195
-                                   195 Exactly like one, like a scene from The Godfather as Frank dances with Ana before the reception guests

The newlyweds cuddle in back
Another car pulls up alongside - Trupo's Shelby - and Doc's right hand instinctively comes off the steering wheel to settle on his holstered gun
Trupo smiles and shakes his head, no

(to Ana) Stay in the car As Frank and Doc climb out, Frank motions to his other security men to remain calm, he'll handle this
Hello, Frank
If Frank is surprised Trupo knows his name, he doesn't show it, or anything else except an air of professional courtesy
Detective
Trupo looks in at Ana in the back seat, smiles at her
She turns her head away and closes the door
Trupo leads Frank away for a private conversation - () 76

She's a beautiful girl - there's no question - but she's got an attitude on (her) - Listen   to me
Before you say another word -   about her - or me - remember that you're   saying it on the most important fuckin   day of my life
Man walks around in a fifty thousand dollar chinchilla coat and he never even bought me a cup of coffee
Something wrong there
don't know what you're talking about
You pay your bills, Frank
You want to keep talking, talk to my lawyer, here's his card
You call him, because we're done here - Do you pay your bills,  asked you
If you're not getting your share, it's not my fault, go ask the chief of police
What's my share
You don't even know me
Maybe 'm special
No, you're all the fuckin same
(shows his shield) What does that say
(Frank ignores him) Special - Investigations - Unit
See that word there
"Special
" (he takes out a restaurant business card) Ten grand, first of each month, delivered here

Detective
There are some things you don't do
This is one of them
Not on a man's wedding day
Frank's resolve throws Trupo off his rhythm
He manages: Have a nice honeymoon

'  -  -                              201 Frank doesn't carry Ana across the threshold
He strides in leaving her at the front door, throws a match in the gas fireplace, comes back from the bedroom a moment later with the $50,000 chinchilla coat and throws it on the flames

Fuck you, 'm not telling you
She comes past the  and into the kitchen past a table covered with dope paraphernalia
Where is my fuckin dope
You and your girlfriends take it again
'll fuckin kill you
She yanks open a drawer, grabs a knife and slashes it at him
He grabs a gun and she runs for the stairs - 203

Richie's lawyer-ex-girlfriend, in bed with him
Richie, yes, fuck me like a cop, not a lawyer - (the phone rings) Oh, God, Richie, no - don't answer it - (he reaches to pick it up) No, no, no - Yeah - / Richie
Newark just picked up one of the celebrities on our Wall of Fame: Teddy's driver
For attempted murder
205
-  -                       205 Richie's had Jimmy Racine brought over
Sits with him as the Three Amigos watch from the shadows
Just coming off his high, and the attempted murder, Jimmy looks disoriented as he sits in cuffs in the dungeon-like basement
Because it's an attempted homicide, that's Grand Jury
Now, that Grand Jury could come in very favorably
Might turn out to be Attempted Manslaughter
Self Defense even
She had a knife
Depends on how  want to deal with you
You see where this is going
Jimmy looks around at the basement dungeon with concern
The fuck is this place
Let's say you beat it somehow
What do you think Cousin Frank'll think of that
He knows you had to sit here listening to something like this
And then you beat an attempted murder
Is he stupid
He'll assume you talked
Jimmy can easily imagine that scenario and it frightens him
() 79
205   :                                                      205 You fucked up, Jimmy
But nobody knows
Frank doesn't know
Yet
Do you want him to read about it in the paper
Or do you want to walk out of here - no bail, no trial - just walk out, now
206
-  -                           206 Jimmy has thought about it all night and walks out of the building into the chilly morning air
/ Jimmy
Look at me - Jimmy looks over his shoulder as if Richie just called to him from it, which he didn't
There's no one in sight - / Any time  want to change my mind don't like the quality of your work can find a witness saw you shoot your girlfriend
It just took me a while even know what he'll look like
He'll look just like you

His detectives

Richie peers into binoculars at: Teddy's car parked by Frank's outside another warehouse loading dock
Frank gets out, discusses something with his brother, comes past Jimmy to some men in bloody white coats
He talks to them, returns to his car, takes a valise from the trunk
He snaps it open revealing stacks of cash, hands it over and walks to a semi-truck, glancing once in Richie's direction
Though he can't see anyone there he gives a wave to them - or is it to the truck driver to pull out - 80
211
-                                      211 Like Bumpy used to do every Thanksgiving, Frank and his brothers, from the back of the truck, hand out hundreds of freshly-butchered turkeys to the poor

' ,

He comes through his entry
Opens the front door
Finds no one there - except a large live turkey on the doorstep
He stares at it nonplussed, then looks up to a sound - a whoosh - as flames engulf the interior and spit out the windows of his Shelby Mustang
B215

After  set it up
Stevie shifts around, not wanting to make Frank mad
don't want to play pro ball,  decided
What're you   talking about
This is your dream since   you were their age - (the   younger kids) Maybe  can   set it up again
Stevie just stands there, uncomfortable
Finally - It's not what  want
want to do what you do, Uncle Frank
want to be you

Teddy comes over but Frank barely notices
We got a problem

Frank and Teddy in back, speaking quietly
He's been cutting it so much it's down to two, three percent pure
You tested it
You're sure
Teddy nods
Frank notices Jimmy looking at them in the rear view mirror

Frank and Teddy, led by a bodyguard, come past some turkey carcasses and other remnants of Thanksgiving to where Jackie and a couple friends cavort with some naked girls
Frank
Welcome
We need to talk
Great
Girls, get out
The girls gather their things and leave
Frank wipes at a modern leather chair with his handkerchief, throws it away, sits
Jackie lays out a couple lines, offers Frank a rolled up hundred dollar straw
Frank shakes his head, no thanks
You talked to Charlie
You want to hear more about my Black Coalition
Let me explain it to you - But first, let me suck up a line of coke - That's not why 'm here
(Jackie glances up from the powder
No
) Everybody's happy, Jackie
Charlie, Baz, the cops, the Italians, everybody
Everybody except you
'm happy
Then  don't understand
Why do you have to take something that's perfectly good the way it is, and wreck it
Jackie doesn't seem to understand
Brand names mean something, Jackie
Consumers rely on them to know what they're getting
They know the company isn't going to try to fool them with an inferior product
They buy a Ford, they know they're gonna get a Ford

(his look says, right
) Blue Magic is a brand name; as much a brand name as Pepsi
own it
stand behind it
guarantee it and people know that even if they don't know me any more than they know the chairman of General Foods
What the fuck are you talking about, Frank
What you're doing, as far as 'm concerned, when you chop my dope down to five percent, is trademark infringement
That
That's what this is about
Jackie nods, but - With all due respect, Frank, if  buy something,  can do whatever  want with it
That's not true
That's where you're wrong
If  buy a car,  can paint it, God damn it
Jackie, you don't need to
You don't need to make more money than you can with Blue the way it is
No one does
At a certain point it's just greed
What do you want, Frank
You want me to call it something else
have to insist
You call it Blue Magic, that's misrepresentation
Fine
'll call it Red Magic, even though it doesn't sound as good
That's all 'm saying
Wrap it in red cellophane and - () 84

Jackie regards Frank for a long moment
Catch me
Insist
Infringement don't like these words as much as please - thank you - sorry to bother you, Jackie
These are better words to use you come into my place without an invitation
Jackie waits to hear a kinder word but Frank doesn't offer one

Eventually - You don't go over there any more
Teddy doesn't like it, but nods
Suddenly his face is illuminated by light reflecting in the rear view mirror, an unmarked police car behind them, flashing its brights
It's all right, pull over, what are they going to do
Give us a ticket
But Teddy isn't as calm as he begins to pull over

Some of it's in the trunk

Teddy shies as if he expects to get hit
The  detectives arrive
Hello, Frank
Detective
How's it going
You have a nice Thanksgiving
did not, as a matter of fact
Get out of the car
The Lucases climb out
Where's the Shelby
The Shelby's gone, Frank
Trupo reaches in the driver's side window, takes the keys from the ignition and comes around to the trunk
Frank and Teddy exchange a glance as it opens
Silence
Then - Want to come over here a minute, Frank
Six kilos of heroin are illuminated by the trunk light
Frank and Trupo regard it in silence
Then - Now what are we gonna do about this
We're gonna shut the trunk and say good night, forget you pulled us over
got a better idea
Trupo reaches into the trunk, picks up two of the heroin bricks, tucks them under his arm and looks at Frank - () 86
223    :                                                         223 Or would you rather  took it all and threw you and your brother in the fuckin river
don't know, would you rather it's your fuckin house blows up next time
They hold each others' stare for a long moment

'  -                                      224 Richie comes in, opens the fridge and stares in, his mind elsewhere

Here in the kitchen Tony and Richie watch kernels of popcorn bounce off the inside walls of the first Amana microwave oven
It's noisier than modern ones
The fuck is a `micro' wave

It rearranges the molecules
Of what
Of anything
Of popcorn
You don't want to put your head in there
Tony rakes out the plain, `pre-microwaveable' popcorn, using his hand
Gives some to Richie
Half of it's burnt
can get you one of these
Just like this, brand new
'll have it delivered
No, thanks
don't want one
Tony hands Richie some snapshots: The Zaca family on the slopes of a resort, and in and outside a beautiful snow- dotted cabin
This is nice, where's this
Aspen
Just got back
Had a great time
'd like to ski Aspen some day
Know who we met
Burt Reynolds
'm not kidding
Lot of people from Hollywood go up there now, buying up everything
This is your place
Are you kidding
You know what it's worth
Ski-in-ski-out, five bedrooms, sauna, everything
We were guests
(pause) No
No, that's your place
Everything seems to stop
Richie becomes aware of the sounds around them, the girls splashing around outside

You know who mean
What Richie knows is that no matter what he does or says at this point he's got a problem
If  don't report what you just said to me, you know  could be in a lot of trouble
If  do, then it's you
'm hoping you won't do that
Richie considers the room itself, measuring the odds of microphones and a recorder being in it somewhere
'm not taping it
How do you know
Because we're friends and 'm telling you
This is a real offer
From who, your uncle
(Tony doesn't say) Why would you do this
Why would you risk our friendship
Because  care what happens to you
You shouldn't have done it
had to
had no choice
Neither do you
Leave Frank Lucas alone
He's not important enough for you to do this
Yes, he is
Richie stares at Tony, then puts the pictures in his hand
Tell Marie 'm sorry  had to leave
You can tell her why

Nothing on his travel, his bank accounts, property holdings - nothing
That's because they all think you're on the take and you think they are
They don't want this to stop
It employs too many people
Cops, lawyers, judges, probation officers, prison guards
The day dope stops coming into this country, a hundred thousand people lose their jobs
Toback isn't as sure the corruption of the official world is that complete
Richie
Excuse me
Spearman gestures to a couple of men in suits who want to talk to him
B231
-  -                         B231 Richie and Tobacke regard the two stone-faced  agents - Who took it out

You understand
No
don't
Not when it's my life

He slows to let the figure get closer, closer, then turns fast, drops the guy and puts a gun to his head
Don't shoot

Richie keeps the gun pressed against the guy's forehead

'm sorry  couldn't give you the kind of life you wanted
'm sorry it was never enough
But don't punish me for being honest
Don't take my son away
She stares at him in disbelief
Then responds in a louder voice than his - () 91

That because you were "honest" and didn't take money like every other cop,  left you
The bailiff looks over, but she doesn't care
You don't take money for one reason: to buy being dishonest about everything else
And that's worse than taking money nobody gives a shit about - drug money, gambling money nobody's gonna miss
(more people look over) 'd rather you took it and been honest with me
Or don't take it,  don't care
But don't then go cheat on me
Don't cheat on your kid by never being around
Don't go out and get laid by your snitches and secretaries and strippers

Your honor, a lot has been said here today about how unsavory Mr
Roberts' environment is for a child
How dangerous it is
'm sorry, but this is our world
This is where we live and we tell him, Protect us
We give him that responsibility, and then say, Oh, but we don't trust you to raise a child

More to himself: Bumpy hardly ever went out at a certain point
He stayed in - read - watched  - played chess
thought he chose to lead a quiet life
He didn't
He couldn't go out without something happening
We can still go out
Where
With who
Everyone  know is under surveillance
can't even be with my family at Christmas anymore
He gets up, pets the dog, and looks out the window at Christmas angels stretched across the street, at people on the sidewalk, wondering perhaps which of them are undercover cops, at Trupo's car, still parked outside
Why don't you just pay who you have to pay
do pay them,  pay them all
Cops, accountants, lawyers, who don't  pay
Everybody

It doesn't satisfy them

The car guns its engine - 251                                                             251 96

Coffins are being off-loaded

They can hear the search continuing upstairs: things being ripped from the walls, the walls themselves splintered apart with sledgehammers, glass breaking
To Mama Lucas - 'm sorry
288
-                                       288 They've looked everywhere and found nothing
The plane, in fact, hardly resembles a plane anymore - no panel left that hasn't been removed, no cavity not probed - except - Richie's glance settles on the military caskets as they're loaded onto a truck, armed soldiers standing guard - 289   /

Trupo, standing at a window glances out at the sound of a barking of a dog to see Frank's German shepherd down in its kennel

The warrant permits me to search the plane and its cargo
The captain doesn't comply
Richie moves to open the coffin himself and every soldier's shouldered rifle immediately comes into firing position, aimed at him
But you don't have my permission
Richie stares at the weapons and the uniformed men holding them, safeties off, fingers on the triggers; all they're waiting for is their commander's order to fire
don't need it

Comes around back
Pushes at the frame
It moves a little, like it's levered - 294
-                                 294 With the rifles still pointed at him, Richie kneels down, pulls the latches of the coffins, half expecting to hear an accompanying barrage of gunfire
He lifts the lid
Sees a long black body bag inside - 295

The  Attorney hangs up a phone
then: That was a military transport plane
If there was heroin on board then someone in the military would have to be involved
Which means that even as it fights a war that's claimed 50,000 Americans lives, the military is smuggling narcotics
Richie's in serious trouble and knows it
As does Toback
That's how these events are being interpreted by General Easton in that call to me
That someone employed by the this office believes the United States Army is in the drug trafficking business - and is trying to prove it by desecrating the remains of young men who've given their lives in the defence of democracy
There are drugs on that plane - Shut the fuck up
Richie does, but can't conceal the contempt he feels for these men who've never spent a minute on the street but act as if know more than him, and who are, in the unfortunate organization of his world, his superiors
Is it any wonder then, because of your actions, the entire federal narcotics program is now in jeopardy of being dismantled as completely and enthusiastic- ally as that fucking transport plane
That's what you've accomplished Mr
Roberts
Single-handedly
had good information the target of my investigation was bringing dope in on that plane
And that target is

No one in the room, except Richie and Toback, has ever heard the name
The federal men regard one another blankly
Who
Who's Frank Lucas
(no one seems to know) Who's he work for
Which family
He's not Italian
He's black
Now there's a longer, even deeper silence, before - Is that supposed to be some kind of joke
You're this close to the end of your career in law enforcement, you're making jokes
believe Frank Lucas is above the mafia in the dope business
believe he buys direct from the source in Southeast Asia, cuts out all the middlemen, and uses military planes and personnel to bring pure No
4 heroin into United States
Richie is looking at faces that are still trying to make sense out of his ridiculous theory
Toback tries to come to his defense - Richie has a lot of experience - Does he
And how many arrests has he made in his so-called investigation
was promised when  took this job, it was about real arrests
Does that mean `none
' have cases against most of Frank's organization
Not him - () 110

No fucking nigger has accomplished what the American Mafia hasn't in a hundred years
Yeah, you'd know, sitting here, having never been on the (street) - Lou, get this fucking kike out of here - Richie goes for him and lands several punches before Toback and the others can pull him off
299                                                               299 300        /

Richie isn't really listening
Strides past his detectives on his way out of the building
To Spearman - It's over
You're shut down
Toback watches as the detectives follow after Richie striding toward his car
301 - 302                                                  301 - 302 A303       /

They had their chance to get out and missed it

C303
'  -                                   C303 He comes down the stairs to where Doc waits
As they head for the door - Frankie - Frank glances to where his mother sits in the living room
Nods to Doc to say, Get the car, 'll be out in a minute
Goes over to his mother
Sit down
He sits
She studies him in a way she hasn't since he was little
Eventually - If you'd have been a preacher, your brothers would be preachers
If you'd been a soldier, they'd be soldiers
Do you know that
(he doesn't say) They all came here because of you
You called and they came running
They look up to you
They expect you to always know what's best
(pause) But even they know you don't shoot cops
Even  know that
Ana knows it
You seem to be the only one who doesn't
Is that where 'm going
never asked you where all this came from because  didn't want to hear you lie to me
Don't lie to me
Don't do that, too
She's not pleading, she's telling
Silence

Because they will
She will - (points upstairs) know  will
Frank has some trouble looking at her
But then gets up
Walks toward the front door to leave
Hesitates near it a long moment
Then turns and walks upstairs
Trupo will live, at least for now, because of her

Set down on tables
The bags unzipped and the bodies removed
rack of clean uniforms is brought in
The morticians begin dressing the corpses and applying make-up on the dry gray skin
New white military caskets are trundled in
Gold handles lifted
The bodies, clothed and painted now, are deposited on the silk linings
The lids of the coffins come down and cellophane bags containing folded flags are taped on top

As the truck drives off - 311

They remove the lids, then the finely-crafted false bottoms, revealing in 4-inch cavities of each, tightly-packed bricks of Double  Globe heroin
As they take them out, a gospel choir begins and continues over: 312

As it passes, Richie, parked by his detectives' cars, recognizes the young driver - who's wearing the same Yankee baseball cap in his
photo
As Richie and his detectives climb into their cars, two Lucas cars fold in behind the laundry truck
The detectives follow at a distance - A314                                                           A314 314

He climbs into Doc's alone
His mother watches, wondering perhaps if he intends to go kill Trupo after all
As Doc's car leaves, so does another

As Abruzzo's makes the same turn behind it, the infamous Stephen Crane Projects rise up in his windshield
His foot comes off the gas
As the gun car passes, he sees Jones's car slow
Teddy's car approaches from another direction into the Projects, and Abruzzo sees Spearman pull over
Then the laundry truck turns in, and Richie's slows to a stop, like Abruzzo's, outside the grounds of the foreboding towers

Reaching the 17th floor, they listen to a strange sound before easing the fire door open enough to see a kid on a Big Wheels pedalling straight at them
He passes and the sound fades
334
17TH   -                                 334 Half the apartment doors are gone
TVs and radios echo, voices argue, infants wail
The detectives come around a corner and see at the end of it: a couple of guys with a sawed-off shotguns sitting outside a closed door
They step back
Consider one other
Spearman volunteers with a nod, continues on alone as the others wait
He walks up to the guys with the guns

got business with Teddy and it's none of your fuckin business except to knock on the fuckin door and get him
As the guy stands, pumping the shotgun, Spearman yanks it hard against his throat like a garrote, forcing him to the floor
The shotgun explodes, showering plaster and pellets
Jones and Abruzzo are instantly all over the other guy as Richie swings the sledgehammer into the door - 335
,   -                       335 The door splinters - the room already in chaos - Teddy, panicked, runs for the bedroom - the detectives crash in yelling at the girls to get down - a shot from somewhere inside wings Abruzzo - Jones and Spearman firing back - crawling across the floor like an infantrymen - Richie comes into the darkened bedroom leading with his pistol
But Teddy's gone
He sees a tapestry of a tiger on a wall
Pulls at it, finds a big hole knocked into another dark apartment, climbs through, sees an open door - 336
-                         336 As Richie rushes out to the hallway he can hear footfalls echoing in the stairwell
He starts down, taking the stairs five at a time, chases Teddy down two flights - Teddy yanks open a door, runs down a corridor, bangs into an apartment
Richie reaches the apartment just as Teddy is goes out onto an exterior balcony - Richie continues along the interior corridor, running parallel to Teddy on the balcony, who trips over some debris and garbage, looking over his shoulder for Richie - Richie cuts through another apartment to head him off, but the door to the balcony is nailed shut
So are the windows
Richie looks around, grabs a small portable television and, just as Teddy runs past, hurls it through a window at him, hitting him in the head
He falls hard, dazed
Richie hurries through the broken window
Teddy comes to and fights back, until Richie breaks his femur with his bare hands
Teddy howls in excruciating pain - 337   /

Glances to a lone figure walking toward him over a rise
Richie
Richie arrives at the grave
Regards the monument to Ellsworth Johnson, and Frank sitting calmly regarding him
Richie glances around the peaceful surroundings

As Frank moves through the gallery, Richie sees it's full of the gangster's friends, many of them celebrities, who smile and greet and fawn as if the Pope has arrived
Richie has evidence tables covered with cash, weapons, stocks, bonds, property deeds, pictures of Frank's holdings, heroin in blue cellophane
Frank has celebrities, community leaders, Joe Louis himself who will testify to Frank's benevolent character
The Champ hugs the heroin trafficker warmly in front of everyone and Richie wonders if he should just give up now
Richie sees it in slow motion: the hands reaching out to Frank, the pats on his back, lipsticked mouths of beautiful women offering kisses and words of encouragement, his old mother giving him a hug
He watches Frank's head turn slowly, his eyes passing his phalanx of attorneys, the jury, finally settling on Richie in his cheap suit seated at the prosecutors table
Frank's eyes smile as they regard Richie, and seem to ask, Can you see this - can you see what you're up against - can you see how insignificant you are
Reaching the end of the welcoming line finally, Frank brushes by Richie and disappears from view somewhere within the protective husk of his multi-million-dollar legal team
Mr
Roberts - Richie slowly lifts himself from his chair, steps forward, turns to look at the jury that's studying him, finally finds his voice: Thank you, your Honor
Ladies and gentlemen - 343
-   -                         343 Wire mesh separates Frank from his battalion of lawyers

Richie takes their place
Frank regards him a moment, offering the same knowing smile from the courtroom
Richie offers nothing
just heard something
said it couldn't be true
You didn't really turn in a million dollars you found in the trunk of a car, did you
Richie doesn't say
Frank searches his face for some clue to where on earth he's from
Want me to tell you what happened to it
It ended up in cops' pockets
Maybe
Maybe
No
It did
All you did was give it to them for nothing in return
Not nothing: You got their contempt
Frank studies him
Why'd you do that
What're you trying to prove, you're better than them
You're not better than them
You are them
don't have the time or interest to listen to (this) - You did it because it was right
That's all
Why's that hard to say
The question is would you do it again
That was a long time ago
It'd be very easy to find out
Tell me you want to find out, tell me the address, and a car will be there, the trunk loaded
Richie knows Frank isn't kidding
No, thanks
Frank suddenly explodes - () 121

You think that impresses me
Guards look over, then glance away once it's clear the outburst is through
Richie remains serene
Eventually - Let me ask you something
You think by putting me in jail, you're going to stop even one junkie from dying
Because you won't
If it isn't me, it'll be someone else
With me or without me, nothing's going to change
Then that's the way it is
You have any sort of case
Or just that idiot drives for my brother
Is he your case
Because if it's just him and the powder, it's not enough
Then you got nothing to worry about
But Frank is worried, most of all by this cop who doesn't take money sitting placidly in front of him
My brothers won't talk to you
My cousins
None of my family
No one but that mother fucking driver
got more than that
got a line of people wanting to testify that stretches out the door and around the block
Bullshit
Is it
Tony the Bug
Benny Two-Socks
Carmine Camanetti
Who the fuck are they
don't know them and they don't know me

343   :                                                     343 They sell dope for the Mazzano crime family
Which you all but put out of business
This is who you're going to put on the stand
Guys who don't know me
Who got nothing to do with me
They have everything to do with you
And the only thing they hate more than you is what you represent
don't represent nothing
You don't
Black businessman like you
Of course you do
But once you're gone, things can return to normal
Look at me
You looking
Can you tell by looking it would mean nothing to me if tomorrow you turned up dead
Get in line
That one stretches around the block, too
Frank has never been so frustrated by anyone in his life
He wants to work something out with Richie obviously, but he can't figure out how
Frank studies him
What can we do
You know what you have to do
Frank does, but doesn't like it, and doesn't know if he can do it
could give you cops, but that's not who you want, is it
You want organized crime names
'll take them, too
want them all

343   :                                                     343 Frank isn't sure he heard right
You'll take them, too
You'd go after cops
Are you serious
You'd do that
Lock up your own kind
They're not
Not the ones in business with you
They're not my kind any more than the Italians are yours
They regard one another in silence
Richie can tell Frank sees daylight
What can you promise me
can promise you if you lie to me about one name, you'll never get out of prison
Lie about one dollar in one offshore account, you'll never get out
You can live rich in jail the rest of your life, or poor outside it, that's what  can promise
Frank is silent for several moments
Finally - You know,  don't care if the feds take all my buildings, my stocks, my off-shore accounts
They can take it all,  don't care - use it to build battleships, paint bridges, whatever the fuck they want
Fight another war
But those other motherfuckers - the cops - put my money in their pockets
Millions
believe it
Frank debates with himself the step he's about to take
want to know everyone   you've met for the last twenty years
Everyone you sold to
Every cop you ever    paid off
Every one who ever stole from   you
Every one you remember

That's not the problem
What is
The jail's aren't big enough

/     -               344 Surveillance photographs of cops seen earlier taking envelopes of money on 116th Street and other drops go up on a new, elaborate Table of Organization - of cops

'  -                               350 Trupo, coffee in hand, comes into his garage from his kitchen
Opens the garage door and sees two squad cars parked outside

-  ( )                          352 Frank gathers his few personal belongings and puts them in a box
Stands with the box and waits for the cell door to open
The Table of Organization and files are gone
Legend:   Frank Lucas was convicted of Conspiracy to Distribute Narcotics and sentenced to 70 years
He served 15 of them
Legend:   Federal authorities confiscated over 250 million dollars from him in real estate, equities and cash in  and foreign banks
353
-  -                         353 Richie, too, is packing, putting personal items into boxes
Legend:   The day after he convicted Frank Lucas and 30 of his Country Boy relatives, Richard Roberts borrowed $400 from his credit union to help pay for a 3-day vacation to the Bahamas
Richie, carrying the box, switches off the lights and closes the door behind him on his way out
Legend:   Six months later, he quit the Prosecutors Office to become a defense attorney
His first client was Frank Lucas

-  (1990)                                      354 Frank steps out into sunlight, free but owning nothing but the cardboard box in his arms
Looks out across the parking lot to see if anyone has come to pick him up
Sees Richie by his car, hand raised above his head like a flag

116TH ,  -                                355 The two of them stand outside Richie's car on the same corner Frank shot Tango
Frank looks up at the street signs that used to say 116th Street and 8th Avenue
Now they say 116th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard
Frederick Douglass Boulevard
What was wrong with just plain 8th Avenue
He considers the street itself
It too has changed
The corner groceries, as Bumpy prophesied, really are gone now

She hated it
Now  don't even have a car
Or her
Frank glances to where his favorite diner used to be, and across the street to where he shot Tango
It isn't a fruit stand any more
Just do what
What
The fuck is that
Just do what
It's a Nike store with huge paintings of Michael Jordan and the admonition "Just Do It
" Sneakers
Expensive ones
Who the fuck would buy those
car equipped with sub-woofer bass comes booming past
Frank stares at it with the same pained look Bumpy had at the discount emporium
Your brothers know you're out
haven't talked to them in years
It's better that way
For them
don't know where they are
Went back to Greensboro when they got out,  guess
Richie nods
Frank looks back at the new storefronts
What am  going to do now, be a janitor
What do  know how to do
How am  going to live
told you  wouldn't let you starve
You told me but you can barely take care of yourself

The look Richie gives him calmly assures Frank if he did that it'd be the last phone he made outside prison - ever
won't
'm just saying  could
He buttons the cuffs of the fake Members Only windbreaker Richie bought him off the street
Thanks for the clothes
You're welcome
Frank glances away to three young hoods coming toward them like they own the sidewalk and everything around it - baggy pants, bandanas tied around their heads
Uh-oh
Look out
Here come the gangsters
Frank's right in their path but doesn't move, forcing one of them to squeeze between him and a parking meter
The gangsta looks back, is about to say something, or do something, but, examining the expression of quiet menace on Frank's face, thinks better of it
The others stop
2 What
The first one is still staring at Frank, but finally has the good sense to let it go
1 Nothing
They move on
Frank glances to Richie
Every idiot gets to be young once
Frank zips up his Members Only jacket, props up the collar and points himself in the other direction
Let's get out of here
