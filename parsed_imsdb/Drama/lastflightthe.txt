Written by John Monk Saunders - On a   of a huge mortar on the edge of a dismal no-man's land, surrounded by trees and overhanging branches
The distant roar of battle ominously
appear and hold for a moment
Abruptly, the image springs to life
The gun  deafeningly
The nearby branches shake violently
Another set of  appears
The image again as a lone bugle plays a charge
Again and again and again, the image moves, the gun  noisily, the image  and more sets of appear with every
On the last discharge, the trumpet fades and all hell breaks loose: Nothing but ,    of: Cannon firing in all directions
Massive explosions on the battlefield that light up the night
Troops marching across a bridge as a shell hits the river below sending water towering into the sky
An entire cavalry division galloping hard over the battlefield, blazing mortar fire visible above them on the horizon
Brief shots of the horses, their grim riders hanging on for dear life, their muscles flexing, hooves pounding the dirt
Men yelling
,    : Mortar fire, explosions, smoke
machine gunner fires
soldier falls
Infantrymen, rifles in hand, press through the haze
More machine gunning
More soldiers go down
massive gun fires
of a tank tread bearing down on the , blacking out the screen
Infantrymen trail behind the heavy machinery, firing pistols, rifles
bridge explodes
building explodes
The ground explodes
bomb drops from an airplane
Aerial view of an exploding building
Anti-aircraft guns at work
Planes in the air
machine gun fires skyward
Planes circle, filling the air
single bi-plane
The plane's gunner,  , looks down, surveys the situation, breaks into a grin
Shep nudges his pilot,  , and points
Cary looks down to see: Another plane below
In it, pilot   waves and salutes
, the gunner, opens his mouth, smiles and nods up at them
An enemy plane arrives
The enemy pilot fires his twin machine guns
Bill and Francis' plane spins away
Bill cocks a snook at the enemy plane and waves dismissively at it, much to Francis' amusement
The planes circle in the air
The enemy plane trails Shep and Cary
Shep  his machine gun to no avail as Cary watches
The enemy pilot returns fire
The two planes tango in mid-air
Shep
The enemy pilot grins and
Bullet holes riddle the side of Shep and Cary's plane
Cary warns Shep they've been hit
From the enemy plane's , Shep and Cary's plane streams black smoke
The two planes
Shep and Cary's plane goes into a steep dive, spinning out of control
Cary rips off his goggles as smoke pours up from below him
Flames fill the cockpit as Cary's gloved hands desperately try to keep hold of the red hot controls
The plane, streaming smoke, spins wildly downward
Shep, surrounded with smoke, looks skyward and salutes with mock gallantry
Above, Bill and Francis watch
Bill returns the salute with a smile and waves
Francis, though, doesn't look happy
Shep twists in his seat and looks around
Cary's hands grasp the controls in the flaming cockpit
(o
s
) Level off, Cary
Level off
Despite the flames, Cary pulls back on the control stick
From the plane's : The landscape rushes by
The plane, now level, crashes into the ground and comes to an abrupt stop
Smoke
Flames
Cary jumps out of the cockpit and rushes back to Shep who is struggling to clamber out
Shep
Shep, are you all right
Can't make it, Cary
Can't make it
Here, give me your arm
'll get you out of here
Hang on there, Shep
Get a hold - Just hold tight, old fella
Cary pulls Shep out and hauls him away from the burning wreckage where the two of them collapse to the ground, half-conscious
Flames consume the plane
: for Lieutenant Shep Lambert, a patient at
Army
Base Hospital 145
Shep's temperature readings for October 11th to October 26th are indicated by a line on a graph, near a level marked
The distant sound of battle continues to
swings into view
This one is for Lieutenant Cary Lockwood whose readings for October 27th to November 2nd are also below the  mark
The line continues and improves considerably by November 11th when the final reading is marked
: - The battle sounds are now joined by a loudly  clock
With no sign of energy or emotion, Shep and Cary sit together on a hospital cot in full uniform
Shep wears dark eyeglasses
Cary has a coat draped over his hands
He glances off
We follow his gaze,  past other patients in the hospital to a wall clock and calendar
It is November 11th and the time is almost eleven
The battle's  drones on
stare up at the clock
Behind his dark glasses, Shep's left eye twitches
slowly  to one last   : soldiers yelling and running, guns firing noisily, a plane crashing, explosions
The final image is of a plane parked on the ground, its engine dying, its propeller slowing to a stop as we    the clock face
The center of the clock is lined up exactly with the center of the propeller -- the slowing propeller blades are replaced by the clock's hands -- as if to symbolically suggest that the war has ended but time goes on
The  of battle fades and only the of the clock remains
the calendar: November 11th, 1918 -- Armistice Day
sit motionless side-by-side on the cot
Shep has a hand over his left eye
Well, the old guerre is finie
That's right
What are ya gonna do now, Shep
Get tight
(turns to him) And then what
Shep lets go of his eye and looks at Cary as if the answer were obvious
Stay tight
Cary grins wryly
: '  - nurse opens a door for Shep and Cary who enter
Shep wears his dark glasses
Cary carries his coat to hide his hands
They pause as the doors they have passed through close behind them
Their distinguished-looking doctor, a medical officer with a white gown over his uniform, sits at his desk studying their papers
Lieutenants Lambert and Lockwood
(rises, joins them) You two leaving us, eh
In a way, 'm sorry to release you two
have no choice in the matter
Shep removes his glasses and presses his hand to his eye
What am  going to do, Major, about my-- oh, this rotten business
The doctor examines Shep's eye more closely
Mm
Spasmodic twitching of the muscles under the eye, eh, Lieutenant
Mm hm
What the French call a tic
--, tic
Little bothersome, isn't it
Shep puts his glasses back on
Yes, sir
'm afraid time'll have to take care of that
Time and normal living
Shep's lips tighten skeptically
You two are returning to the United States,  presume
Shep glances at Cary
Ah, we haven't decided
'd take the first boat home
Well, here you go
The doctor gives Shep his release form and shakes his hand, then turns to shake Cary's
Cary merely looks down darkly and raises a bandaged hand at him
Oh,  forgot your burnt hands
The doctor folds up the release and stuffs it in Cary's breast pocket
Neither of you is fully hospitalized
'd undertake a systematic course of finger exercises -- to, uh, stretch them and loosen them up
In time, you'll regain their full use
Thank you, sir
The doctor gives Cary a pat on the shoulder
Bye, Lieutenant
Cary manages a smile and salutes
Shep moves to the door, saluting the doctor
Bye, Lieutenant
Good luck
Shep opens the door and he and Cary head out
After the door closes, the doctor rubs his head thoughtfully
He talks, apparently, to an offscreen aide
Well, there they go
Out to face life
(shakes his head) And their whole training was in preparation for death
He moves off as we : - Shep and Cary exit the building but pause outside the doorway
They've seen something coming toward them and glance at one another before clearing out of its path
They watch glumly as a small group of wounded soldiers enter through some metal gates, walk slowly past Shep and Cary without acknowledgment, and head into the hospital
: '  - The office window opens
The doctor -- no longer in white but wearing his uniform -- and his aide take a break, standing in the window frame for a little fresh air
The doctor smokes a cigarette as they discuss Shep and Cary
Why can't they go on with flying
You know, the air mails or something
'm afraid they're unfit for further service in that direction
The aide looks at him, quizzically
They fell, you know -- six thousand meters
(shakes his head, sadly) Like dropping a fine Swiss watch on the pavement
Shattered both of them
Their nervous systems are deranged, disorganized, brittle
Spent bullets
Spent bullets
That's it
(nods) They're like projectiles, shaped for war and hurled at the enemy
(gestures with cigarette) They've described a beautiful, high-arching trajectory
And now they've fallen back to earth
Spent
Cooled off
Useless
We slowly   from the two men
Oh, well, if they take care of themselves, they'll pull through all right
Even if they do take care of themselves, what good are they
What can you expect of them
(shakes his head) hate to think what may become of them
We have pulled back far enough and now we : - Two uniformed men with familiar faces -- exuberant pilot Bill and reserved gunner Francis -- arrive at the bottom of the stairs in front of the hospital
Bill, with his arm in a sling, and Francis, using a cane, start up the stairs and wave
(Texas accent) Hello, Cary
Hi, Cary
At the top of the stairs, Shep and Cary wave back, pleased to see them
Hello, Bill
Hiya, Francis
Hello, Bill
Francis
Unexpectedly, Shep and Cary hurry down the stairs past them
(friendly) Well,  see you got yours
(pleasantly) Yup
We crashed
Bill and Francis watch, surprised, as Shep and Cary hurry off
(calls down, puzzled) Hey
Where you going
Shep and Cary, already seated in the back of a waiting automobile, grin like kids
Paris
(o
s
) Paris
From the stairs, Francis smokes a cigarette and looks down at Shep and Cary uncertainly
But Bill takes the news in stride -- he smiles and waves his hat at them
See you in Paris
(waves his cigarette) Yeah
Smiling, Shep and Cary wave back as their car drives off
: - superimposed text reads: -- 1919
Traffic noise, taxi horns squeaking
: - Strolling down the sidewalk four abreast, as if they own the town, come our heroes -- Bill, Shep, Francis and Cary -- in smart hats and dinner clothes
Outwardly, they seem to have recovered from their wounds
But: Shep still wears his dark glasses and we occasionally glimpse his eye twitching
Cary's bandages are gone but he has not regained full use of his hands
His personality is dark and dry, more subdued than Shep's, and he comes across as the most levelheaded, rational member of the group -- its unacknowledged leader
Francis seems to have suffered the greatest toll psychologically narcoleptic, strangely detached and unemotional much of the time, always on the verge of dozing off, his speech slurs even when he isn't drunk
Only the athlete of the group, Bill -- a burly Texan whose full name is William Talbot -- is in outstanding physical shape
But he is reckless, restless, and temperamental, covering up unnamed insecurities with bravado and forced exuberance
How 'bout a cocktail
Not a bad idea at that
As a group, they turn and head into a nearby building
: made of light bulbs, outside the building
It spells out ' -- a popular Parisian drinking establishment for Anglo-Americans
: ' - Numerous shelves holding numerous bottles of liquor
Employees in white jackets hurriedly rush in and pull down a few bottles
: '  - The place is packed with well-dressed men and women
The bar is crowded with men (and men only, for no women are allowed to sit at Claridge's bar) smoking, drinking, conversing
At the end of the , we discover our heroes entering, greeted by an employee who takes their hats
- An attractive young woman with a wide, vacant stare stands against a wall opposite the bar holding a champagne glass in her hands
Her name is  and she seems to be in a world all to herself
Our four handsome heroes file past her, intent on finding a table
Only Cary pays any attention to Nikki
After they have all passed her, he pauses to turn and stare
She's extremely nearsighted and doesn't notice him
He looks at the glass in her hand, puzzled
He starts off but then pauses
After a second uncertain look, he moves off to join his friends who stand together and peer around the crowded room, unable to find a place to sit
Cary keeps looking at Nikki
He glances at the others and they follow his gaze: still wearing a blank expression, clutches the glass in two hands
in her hands
Between her fingers, we glimpse its contents -- a complete set of men's false teeth
We   to discover that Cary has approached her
He's standing right next to her and is staring at the glass
She finally notices him
beg your pardon
But, if 'm not too inquisitive, would you mind telling me what  that you're drinking
Teeth
Teeth
After another look, Cary turns to his friends
Hey, it's teeth
(o
s
) Teeth
Shep, Bill and Francis hurry over like children and crowd around to stare in amazement at the teeth
Nikki is unimpressed by all the attention
Teeth
That's right
(enthusiastic) Yup
It's a full set -- upper and lower
(to Nikki) It's a nice expression
Hey, how come you're with those teeth
was just standing here
And a nice gentleman came along and begged my pardon and asked would  mind holding his teeth for a minute
Well, what did he want you to hold his teeth for
Said he wanted to biff somebody
(excited) Biff somebody
Which way did he go
Just around to the right
Come on, men
We're liable to see a fight
As quickly as they arrived, Shep, Bill and Francis depart
Cary starts after them but stops to politely address Nikki who has gone back into her trance
Would you like to come along
(as if it were obvious) Oh, no
have to stay here and mind the man's teeth
They glance down at the teeth
Oh, of course
Cary hurries off as Nikki's empty eyes rise to the ceiling
-  ' as it takes a combination one-two punch from a pair of fists
-  ' dropping unconscious to the floor
enter a hallway just in time to see two Claridge's employees reach down and haul away the unconscious body
Our heroes have missed the fight but Shep and Bill are delighted anyway
Bill brushes his hands (one of his favorite gestures) with satisfaction, as if he had thrown the punches himself: Well
' all fixed
Bill straightens his bow-tie
Already the group seeks a new distraction
Let's go back
They head back to the bar
Nikki, no longer standing against the wall, sits on a bar stool with her back to the countertop, smoking a cigarette and holding an empty champagne glass
Our heroes enter and, glancing at the wall, fail to see her
After a moment of searching, Cary spots her at the bar
Oh, there she is
All four crowd around her, pleased to be in her company
Well, we missed it
Did something happen
Well, they carried a guy out
(sees her empty glass) Say
What's become of the teeth
Oh, the man came and got his teeth
Well, what did he say
He said thank you for holding his teeth
What did he look like
think he fell in an airplane in the war -- and got his teeth knocked out
Well, why do you think he was in the war
Oh, he had a kind of little striped ribbon in his buttonhole
What makes you think he was a flyer
His eyes
His eyes
(dry, to the others) You can tell a flyer better by his ears
The men chuckle
Well, what do you say we have a drink
Fine
Sure, here's some space
Seats have opened up at the bar so they grab stools next to Nikki
Shep greets the bartender: Hello, Jean
Bon soir, Monsieur Lambert
Qu'est-ce que voulez-vous [
] Martini
Martini
Martini
Martiniiii
Could  have a champagne cocktail
Certainment, Mademoiselle
(calls off) Quatre Martinis pour messieurs
Champagne cocktail pour Mademoiselle Nikki
The men are all excited to find out her name
Francis uses a pretzel as a monocle to eye Nikki
Nikki
Nikki
Nikki
For the first time this evening, Shep takes off his dark glasses
Can you imagine that, fellas
Her name is Nikki
(considers the situation) Her name is Nikki
She holds men's teeth
She sits at the bar and she drinks champagne
(significantly) Boys, she's gonna be a lot of trouble
Drinks are served
moment of silence as they imbibe
Nikki's hand shakes as she lifts her glass, spilling some champagne
She laughs, embarrassed
Oh, my, my
Shep, who has been watching her closely, also laughs
Poor sweet
She can't even hold her glass
Nikki notices Cary unsteadily using both his hands to hold his Martini
(casually) Oh, well,  can't either
Besides, he has to use two hands
Nikki chuckles
dark look crosses Cary's face as he looks at her and puts down his drink
Seeing this, Bill and Francis exchange worried glances
Cary abruptly rises and leaves the bar
Mystified, Nikki looks quizzically at Shep who is suddenly grim and annoyed
Course he can't hold his glass
His hands are burned
Burned
You have no right to spill drinks
He can't help himself
Burned
How burned
He brought a plane down on fire
An airplane
In the war
Shep demonstrates with his hands as he explains: He held the stick
But his hands began to slip
Then he held it inside his arms
He was trying to bring his rear gunner down alive
Did he bring him down safe
Well
Shep takes a swallow of his Martini, sets down the glass
Brought him down
Oh, so that's why--
Yes
That's why he can't hold a glass
Oh, 'm so ashamed
Now, Cary's had a pretty thin time
His nerves are tricky
You should never call attention to his hands
Cary sits with a fresh drink and is trying awkwardly to pick it up when a handsome but humorless American journalist -- the unspeakable  -- enters and greets him casually
Hi, Cary
(unhappily) Oh, hello, Frink
Cary immediately turns his attention to a menu
Rebuffed, Frink wanders over to the bar and sees the other men
He has a friendly pat on the back for Francis and Bill
Hello, Francis
Bill
Frink pauses to stare at Nikki's back, astonished to find a woman sitting at the bar
Then he turns to Shep, amused
Shep
Drunk again
Say, don't you know any opening remarks
It's about all we've heard from you for a year
(signals the bartender) Hi
Jean
Frink snaps his fingers at Jean and grabs a seat next to Shep
Jean asks for Frink's order in French
Un sidecar
Sidecar
[
] Jean moves off
Frink regards the others
Say, why don't you fellows go home and go to work
Work
What kind of work
Oh, anything useful
What could we do
Sell washing machines
Drive a milk wagon
Mend old furniture or somethin'
Heh
Go back to flying
Fly the air mails
Aw, we couldn't fly a kite
Maybe a small kite
Francis holds his fingers to indicate a very small kite
Bill chuckles
Well, there must be something you can do
We've got to tend to our drinking
We don't get much opportunity
Lots of things going on outside
Sun shining, trees growing, people walking around
Say
Is that  going on
(laughs) Sounds pretty pre-war to me
During all this, Nikki has been in her own little world
Frink leans over and whispers to Shep
Hey
Don't  rate an introduction
Who's your swell friend
Oh, her
Just an old hussy we found scattered around
Around her neck, on a slender chain, Nikki carries a small lorgnette
It opens with a spring and has small rectangular lenses
She uses it frequently, peering at unfamiliar objects in her helpless, nearsighted way
On Shep's remark, she whips it out to stare at him, mildly offended
He raises his drink to his lips and turns to her, speaking out of the side of his mouth: (off Frink) Pay no attention
Sometimes he goes away
Nikki looks away glumly as Shep grins at her
She turns and sees something
She raises her lorgnette for a better look at: who sits at his table, staring into space, holding his unread menu in his lap
is pleased to see Cary
Oh
He didn't go
She rises to join him
startled, rises and stares at Nikki as she approaches
Oh, 'm so sorry
Your hands
She tries to take his hands but he pulls them away in horror and stuffs them in his pockets
Oh, your poor hands
Your poor, poor hands
Wildly uncomfortable, Cary glances around like a cornered animal and finally stalks away without a word, hands still stuffed in his pockets
Stunned, Nikki watches him exit the building
She realizes she's done something terribly wrong and moves to follow him
Oh
But Shep intercepts her
Upset, she whimpers
(more in disbelief than anger) If you aren't the
First, you insult his hands and make him mad
Then you cry over them and make him self-conscious
Come on back here
Come on
He clasps her hand and leads her to: Francis and Bill watch, disturbed, as Shep guides a crying Nikki onto a stool beside them
Shep sits next to her as she continues to sob
She pulls out a compact to fix her tear-stained face
Well, that's torn it
He'll never come back now
Then we'll have to find him
What for
To explain how sorry  am
(amused at her distress) We-ell
You don't have to get so emotional about it
Who's getting emotional
You are
You're coming all apart
(hands her a glass) Here
Take a drink of this
Make you laugh and play
Nikki takes a sip, then busies herself with putting away her compact
Meanwhile, Bill leans in
(to Shep) Say, what's she crying about
She's crying on account of they didn't wash her strawberries this morning
(to Nikki) Didn't they wash your strawberries this morning
Well, there ain't a whole hell of a lot that we can do about that now
(agrees, sadly) No
Frink watches suspiciously as Shep pays the tab, rises and whispers to Nikki
Let's go
Nikki obediently hops off her stool and Shep leads her away from the bar, toward the exit
Bill and Frink are distressed to see her go
Bill calls after Shep: Hey
Where're you goin'
Oh, out
(rises) Out where
(o
s
) Out to get a drink
Bill gestures grandly toward the bar with its many shelves of liquor bottles
Don't you suppose you could arrange that here
Nope
We gotta go somewheres else
(without missing a beat) Okay
Come on, Francis
We got to go somewheres else to get a drink
Francis and Bill head out the door
After a moment, Frink follows behind
: - taxi cab -- filled with Bill, Francis, Shep, Nikki and Frink -- pulls up to a restaurant
As it stops, Bill rises and points to someone at a sidewalk table
Hey
There he is
The others look
Where
Come on
The group cheers, spills out of the taxi and heads for: where Cary sits reading a newspaper
(o
s
) Cary
Cary looks up
He rises, a little startled, and politely removes his hat
The others crowd around him
Say, what are you tryin' to do, disown us
(genuinely polite) Hello
Won't you sit down
Sure we'll sit down
What'd ya think we'd do
Stand around
They all take seats around the little table
During this, Frink brings a chair for Nikki who grabs a seat of her own
When he tries to use it to sit next to her, Bill commandeers it for himself
(with a wave, to Frink) Thank you
waiter joins them as they settle in
Hello, Cary
Hello, Shep
Hello, Nikki
What will you have to drink
Martini
Martini
Martini
Martini
Quatre Martinis
Uh, could  have champagne, please
Champagne
Oui
The waiter departs
Off her order, Bill gives Nikki a look
Boys, she's goin' to be a problem
(explains, to Bill) That's what  started on
(to Cary) It upsets me if  change over to anything else
(to Bill) There's a lot of things wrong with this one
(to Nikki) What were you doing at the bar at Claridge's anyway
Yes
Don't you know you're not supposed to be there
There's a sign on the wall says ladies must sit at the back
Can't read signs
Well, we'll just have to take care of her, that's all
Do you think she's good-lookin' enough
Oh,  know 'm not very good- looking but-- But what
But when  was a little girl, my mother always said  had the nicest hair-ribbon
Shep laughs derisively
The others give him a look and he shuts up
The drinks arrive
All the men, save Cary, snatch up their glasses
Bill removes the toothpicked olive and swallows his Martini whole
He watches Nikki rubbing her champagne's drinking straw between her hands as if she were a Boy Scout trying to start a fire
Then there's her drinking
What's the matter with my drinking
You're a sissy drinker
Well, maybe  can improve
Meanwhile, Cary attempts -- with some success -- to drink his Martini with one unsteady hand
Bill inspects Nikki's mouth
Then there's her teeth
Why, one of 'em is turned sideways
(points) You mean this one
That's it
Why don't you have it turned around
don't have it turned around on account of it's a kind of help
Well, in what respect does it kind of help
Well, you see, when anyone kisses me too hard, it splits my lip
And you could tell when anyone kissed me too hard on account of my lip would bleed
So now  don't let anyone kiss me -- hard
The men are amused
Nikki sips her champagne
Well, we'll let that pass
Bill chuckles
Shep abruptly rises and walks off, presumably to the rest room
Where's he gone
Shep went off to sharpen his skates
Now, about your nose
What about my nose
It isn't straight
It kind of turns up at the end
Well, when  was a little girl, got bumped by a swing
How'd you happen to get bumped
just walked through the gate was only seven
Oh, poor dear
Didn't you see it
can't see very far
Did it hurt
It made me dizzy all day
Well,  guess we can't hold that against her
We all make mistakes
That's right
Michelangelo painted Adam with a navel
Bill and Nikki laugh at this
Suddenly, Nikki grows thoughtful
All the same, he'd look funny the other way -- even in a painting
They all consider this for a moment as a fresh round of drinks arrives
Frink abruptly rises and walks off, presumably to the rest room
Where's he gone
He went off to shave a horse
Have you got a husband or anything
No husband
mother
Mother, yes
But we haven't met in quite a long time
Why not in a long time
Well, on account of my mother's name was Beulah
Now, you can't have a mother named Beulah
So  changed it to Jane
And that's how it all began
An odd  sound distracts them
They look off to see: the narcoleptic, arms folded, asleep in his chair
He awakes with a frown, pulls a pocket watch from inside his jacket, opens it, and looks at it
The chiming ends and he rises without a word and exits
Nikki watches Francis' exit curiously
Bill waves her off before she can ask: He's goin' off to tame an alligator
Who is he, anyway
Francis used to fly with us in the 94th
The best shot in the squadron
Brought down twelve planes
Used to call him "Sudden Death
" He lost interest after his teammate got killed
He's lonesome is all
like him
He carries a chiming watch on account of he's always falling asleep in the daytime
What kind of chimes
Oh, Westminster, Canterbury, and Whittington
'll take vanilla
Cary puts a fist on his hip and gives Nikki an exasperated look
Taxi horns squeak
Francis, Shep and Frink return from their various adventures and sit down as Bill gives Nikki his opinion of Francis
think he's a washout
Well, just because you're a big bombardier and an All-American-- (interrupts) All-American what
Halfback
Where
Oh, Montana State or somewhere
Idaho or Nebraska or the Carlisle Indians or something
Didn't you never read about Bill
Bronko Bill -- the Alabama Flash
Bill grins as Nikki inspects him closely through her lorgnette
(skeptical) think it's a forgery
Bill's face falls
He looks at Nikki
Say
What do you want me to do
Tackle a horse
She nods
Shep is amused
Sure
Go ahead
Tackle a horse
(with a dismissive wave) All right, all right, 'll tackle a horse
Shep looks down the street
Here comes one now
They all look to see: - rolling down the street in their direction
Everyone watches as Bill rises and suddenly bolts in the direction of the cab
Look out, horse
- rolling along as Bill runs in and tackles the horse, locking his big arms around the animal's front legs to trip up the poor creature
Cary, horrified, stands and yells: Hey, Bill
Bill
Come back here
Cary runs off, toward Bill, leaving a thrilled Shep and a worried Francis with a distressed Nikki
They all stare in concerned amazement as a crowd of pedestrians stops to watch the excitement
(distraught) Oh, Bill
- Cary rushes up to the startled cab driver who is pulling hard on the reins
Hey
What's the idea -- runnin' down my friend like that
Here
Cary forces a wad of francs into the driver's hand
The cabman protests in French but takes the cash
of the fallen horse as the driver descends from the cab
Standing up now, Bill tries to haul the horse to its feet while Cary tries to placate the driver
Never mind
Look where you're going in the future now
You just watch out where you're going
Bill grabs the horse by its bridle and tries to pull it up
The horse, sorely annoyed, gets up on its own and shakes its head violently to drive Bill away
Bill hangs on and tries to calm the horse
Cary tries to pull Bill away as Frink, Francis and the driver gather around
Bill is more interested in petting the horse which understandably shies away from him
(admonishes Bill) Now listen, come on out here, you old fool
(to the shying horse) Whoa, whoa
Nice horsie
(to Bill) Now, listen, you ought to be ashamed of yourself
You old fool
You know what you'll do
You'll kill yourself one of these days
Now, come on, get out of here
Now, listen-- Satisfied with the outcome of all this, Bill heads back for the sidewalk
(to the driver) You all right now, brother
The driver nods but is more concerned with reining in his skittish horse
All right
Now, you just keep your horse, see
You got your money
The cabbie salutes Cary but pays more attention to his horse
The waiter sets out a fresh round of drinks as the group returns
Bill happily dusts off the sleeve of his dinner jacket
Cary, beside him, leads him to his seat
They all sit down under the following: Hey, listen, Bill, you're All- American, see
You're  All- Americans
The lady's convinced you're the whole team
You don't have to tackle any more horses
How 'bout that
Drink your drink
(pleased with himself) Ahhh
Wasn't that a great spill
Nikki abruptly rises
Hey
Where are you going
Would you all excuse me for a moment
Well, where are you going
(a grave announcement) To take a Chinese singing lesson
Francis immediately understands that she's become one of them
He raises an olive in the air and cheers: Hooray
The men rise and all but Frink cheer her lustily as she departs: Hooray
Hooray
Hooray
Hooray
walks proudly into the restaurant as the men cheer
smiling maitre d' directs her to the ladies' room
Frink watches Nikki disappear from view and, after a glance at the others, rises and follows her
Shep, Bill and Cary remain at the table, laughing and drinking
Bill turns to Cary with a smile
Hey
What kind of a girl do you think Nikki is
Cary glances in Nikki's direction and tells Bill confidentially: think she's the kind that sits down on phonograph records
Bill thinks about this and nods
As Nikki returns from her Chinese singing lesson, Frink puts his arm against a wall, blocking her way
Say, Nikki, let's ditch these drunks and go off somewhere by ourselves
These crazy fools are liable to do anything
(hopeful) Do you think so
Since the war, they don't care what happens
And do you
'll say so
've got more important things to think of
What more important things
Well, my work
What kind of work
'm the foreign correspondent for a New York newspaper syndicate
(genuinely) How nice for you
Nikki pushes his arm away and heads for the table
Frink watches her go, a dark look on his face
The men rise briefly as Nikki rejoins them and sits
Nikki
Are you the kind of girl that sits down on phonograph records
Nikki lowers her eyes
(a bit defensively) People shouldn't leave their records lying about
(to Francis) What did  tell you
(abruptly brightens) Take me dancing
What place you wanna go
What places you got
Well, we got Maxim's, only it's too early
We've got Florida, Perroquet, Pigalle, Le Rat Mort, Moulin Rouge, Bal Tabarin
'll take vanilla
Cary gives her a look
Bill clears his throat
Somebody pay for the drinks
Bill rises and claps his hands with enthusiasm
We're off in a "billizzard" of horse-radish
Whatever that means
The men rise and retrieve their hats
: - festive Parisian night spot
Dance  plays while a floor show, lit by moving spotlights, unfurls in the huge, darkened ballroom which is ringed with crowded tables
handsome male dancer, in tuxedo and top hat, whirls exuberantly around the floor, surrounded by beautiful chorus girls
Somewhere above all this, Nikki, lit by spotlight flashes, sits on the edge of a ringside balcony observing the show with eager interest through her lorgnette
The show continues: after a few twirls, the dancer links arms with the girls to form a line and do some precision high-kicking
The music continues but the dance apparently ends and the lights come up
Impressed, Nikki is breathless
My, my
Isn't this nice
Nearby, the men sit at a roped-off table for six on a low balcony
Cary and Francis sit glumly on one side of the table as Bill tries to tell a story to the others (Frink; a nameless young woman nicknamed "Kiss-Me-Quick" who appears in this scene only; Shep and Nikki)
Now, listen, men
'll tell ya something funny
Cary and Francis look doubtful about this
Bill sits at the table
was only four years old once
(to Cary) What'd he say
Said he was only four years old once
Amazing
And my aunt had a very low-neck dress on
(to Cary) What'd he say
Said his aunt had on a very low-neck dress
Can't believe it
And she sat right across the table in front of me
And  said, "Auntie --  can see your knees
" Nobody laughs or even changes expression
(pointedly, after an awkward pause) wonder what's doing in Portugal tonight
Bill is disappointed at the response
Maybe 'd better do my match trick
If you do match tricks, 'll recite
Recite what
Poetry
Whose poetry
My poetry
You write poetry
'll send you a photograph of my poetry
Cary gives her a look, then rises and peers with one eye into the open bottle of champagne on the table between him and Nikki
He gestures at the bottle as he sits back down
Say,  wonder if there's anything intoxicating in that
Everybody cracks up -- except Nikki, who looks a little hurt
An empty champagne bottle is placed on the floor
: - By now, a dozen empty champagne bottles have been placed on the floor
- ' strays to Nikki's legs and up her dress
Nikki rises indignantly and turns on Frink
Just what  your plans
The other men seated at the table understand instantly what's going on and stare darkly at Frink
You'll have to watch that lad, Nikki
He's a member of the Wandering Hands Society and he has a groping good time
Frink nervously adjusts his necktie
Cary glares at him
Your behavior, sir, is unseemly, unethical, indelicate and lousy
Have  made myself clear
Frink, pretending chagrin, looks at Nikki
All right
My mistake
'm sorry
You'll have to watch out for him, Nikki
He's just a licentious old man
It's getting pretty late, isn't it
Do you want to go home, Nikki
(rises) 'll take you home
Where do you live
Hotel Carlton
The others, except for Frink, begin to rise, too
Shep pays the waiter
'll take her home, too
So will
We'll match to see who takes her home
Nothin' doing
We'll  take her home
saw her first
It makes no difference
She belongs to us all now
Nikki laughs as they all depart
Frink rises wearily to follow them out
: -  - The group enters the spacious, empty lobby, laughing loudly
Someone says, "Wheeee
" Others say, "Ssshhh
" They cross to the front desk
The clerk is fast asleep, his head down on the desk
Nikki is about to wake him when Bill bounds forward
(quietly, to Nikki) Sh
Let him sleep
What's your number
(whispers) Eighty-eight
Bill waves the others on and they exit toward the elevators
Once they've gone, Bill, the athlete, vaults the front desk and lands -- with a little noise -- on the other side, without waking the clerk
He cautiously checks the clerk to make sure the sleeping man hasn't awakened, then fetches Nikki's key from its cubbyhole
Bill leaps up on top of the desk, landing on his rear end, swinging his legs around -- nearly kicking the clerk in the process -- then silently slides off the desk to the floor
Watching the sleeping clerk warily, Bill tiptoes away
At the last possible moment, Bill purposefully  the signal bell with his hand, making it  noisily
The clerk awakens with a start and grabs a nearby telephone just as Bill disappears from view
Amused, the group piles into the "ascenseur"
Last one in is Bill who shuts the door and the metal safety gate behind him
Here we are
Goin' up
Who's gonna pilot this craft
'll take her off
Where's the throttle
Bill looks for the controls as Cary turns playfully to the others
Got your safety belts buckled
& Mm hmm
Bill finds the appropriate lever and grabs hold
Here it is
Contact
Contact
Bill pulls the lever and the car rockets up the shaft
We're off
Most everybody cheers
They watch with great interest as the floors pass by rapidly
Shut her off
Hold her nose
She's headed for the hangar
(nervous) Hey, stop it, will ya
We've gone an' passed my floor
Gone an' passed your floor
'll fix that
Bill brakes the car and starts it back down the shaft
Put her tail down
Bail out, boys
She's gonna crash
Wheeeee
(nervous) Stop it
Stop it
We've gone an' passed my floor again
Say
How do you stop this thing
Bill brakes the car too quickly -- it slams to a halt and everyone loses their footing, nearly falling down
Part of the light fixture above them breaks loose and crashes down on Frink's head, much to everyone's amusement -- they laugh as Frink clutches his head, annoyed
That's right, laugh
We should've brought our parachutes
Get a good hold, Millie
We're off again
Bill reaches for the controls but Shep grabs the tail of Bill's jacket and pulls him away
Nothing doing
Let Cary take the controls
You'll run us through the roof
Bill brushes his hands, his pride a little hurt
All right, all right
All set
Let her go
The car starts up the shaft again
Hurray
& Hurray
There we are
: -   -   - The elevator door opens
Cary leads the way as everyone else spills out happily into the hall
Shep puts a congratulatory arm around Cary
Say
That's a pilot for ya
You deserve a medal
Bill pins Nikki's room key to Cary's vest pocket
Smiling, Cary holds it up proudly to Nikki
All right, come on, men
They head down the hallway in a drunken, disorganized fashion
Shep walks an imaginary tightrope, wobbling spectacularly
Cary, bringing up the rear, shuts the elevator door and escorts Nikki
need a rest,  need a rest
Francis drops into a handy chair and lights a cigarette but Bill immediately hauls him up: Come on, come on
Bill, whistling and pretending to ice skate, leads the group down the hall
Francis tries to enter a room but Frink pulls him out of the doorway
Bill backtracks to help Frink escort Francis
This allows Cary and Nikki to take the lead
Nikki indicates the correct doorway to Cary
Right here
Oh
Eighty-eight
Here we are
The group cheers
Cary unlocks the door
The group enters Nikki's hotel room
'   -   - Laughing, the group files into the darkened room and spreads out
Wheeeee
Nikki switches on the lights
Bill marvels at the luxurious suite
Well, for--
Well, 'll be a--
Look
Nikki's got a whole apartment
And a gramophone
Delighted, Shep starts to crank up the gramophone
(unimpressed) Yeah
And chairs and tables and floors and ceilings and everything
So  is where Nikki lives
Amused and pleased by their reaction, Nikki heads for her bedroom
Yes, this is where Nikki lives
Shep picks up a book and admires it grandly
And she's got a book
The gramophone comes to life and  plays from a record
Nikki passes into the bedroom and switches on a light
Got all the comforts of home
Frink tries to follow Nikki into the bedroom but Bill pointedly intercepts him
Disappointed, Frink looks past him into Nikki's bedroom and Bill follows his gaze to see: on Nikki's glass-topped dressing table -- dozens of them
Hey
Look at all the bottles
Bill enters and inspects the table closely
' as the other four men respond to Bill's enthusiastic summons and enter
Hey
Come on in and look at Nikki's bottles
Cary joins Bill at the table as the Texan picks up one of the bottles and reads the label
Ylang
Ylang
Hey, don't be handlin' her things
Put 'em down
But Bill goes right on, delighted
The others crowd around the table
Chichi
Leave 'em alone
Salammbo
Chypre
Reve de Vestale
Jinko
Hey, you big bombardier-- Chiki chiki
During this, Francis has casually inspected a curtained walk-in closet near the table
He pulls the curtain to reveal a rack of carefully hung dresses and a floor covered with dozens of shoes organized in impeccably straight lines
Say,  never saw so many shoes
The others gather to peer into the closet
Frink loses interest immediately but whistles at the sight of Nikki's sheer nightgown draped across her bed
He moves to it eagerly
Nikki sits on the edge of the bed removing her shoes as Frink picks up her silk bedclothes and examines them with a grin
Bill pointedly takes the gown out of Frink's hand
Tight-lipped, Frink stares at him
Suddenly, Bill points to a small wind-up clock on Nikki's night table
Look
Bill drops the garment on the bed and moves to the night table
She never winds her clock
(picks up the clock) It says eleven and 've never been anywheres at eleven
Nikki removes her earrings as Frink walks off and Cary takes a seat at the foot of the bed
(dry, to Bill) What time are you anywhere
Bill shakes the clock and puts it to his ear, listening
(to Cary, ignoring Nikki) Two o'clock
It's always two o'clock in my life
Hey, listen
Besides never having any matches and always spilling her drinks, she never winds her clock
Think 'll go in the bathroom and see if she leaves the cap off her tooth paste
Bill heads for the bathroom but then stops and turns back to Nikki
Is it all right
Help yourself
Bill disappears into the bathroom, leaving Nikki and Cary sitting on the bed
Nikki peers at Cary through her lorgnette
(friendly, sympathetic) Hello
(grins) Hello, yourself
The phonograph  ends just as Bill's voice calls from the bathroom
(o
s
) (excited) Cary turns toward the bathroom
Turtles
(o
s
) Turtles
Shep runs past and hurries into the bathroom
Cary rises from the bed to follow
Nikki is perhaps mildly surprised by the excitement
- swimming in shallow water at the bottom of a bathtub
couple of decorative lily pads lie next to the drain
The turtles' shells are inlayed with brilliants
Bill kneels by the tub as Frink, Shep, Francis and Cary join him
Bill points out his discovery to the others
Turtles
Turtles
(thrilled) It  turtles
Francis picks up a turtle and shows it to Cary
Hey
Look, Cary
It's turtles
Cary examines the turtle for a moment, placing a finger on it
(with a nod) Nice work, boys
It's turtles
Cary and Francis inspect the turtle
Nikki enters and addresses the men
And now do you suppose you could all excuse me
Cary joins her
On account of 'd like to go to bed
Sure we'll excuse you
'll clear everybody out of here
(to the others) Come on, you fellas
Nikki wants to go to bed
The other men, still lined up at the tub enjoying the turtles, are disappointed
Go to bed
Awww
Bed
They rise reluctantly
Bill shakes water off his hand
Yup, all right
They file out of the bathroom
(waves to the turtles) So long, turtles
Good night, turtles
Night, turtles
Frink follows the others humorlessly, without a word to the turtles
- The entire group exits the bathroom, passes through the bedroom and heads into the sitting room
Poor Nikki
Do you wanna go to sleep
(nods) Mm hm
Sleep
You should  go to sleep
(with a wave, to Nikki) Well, good night
As Bill enters the sitting room, he looks around and hurries away toward something he sees off screen
Shep and Francis follow
(with a wave) Nighty-night, Nikki
Francis says nothing
Good night, Nikki
Frink is the last out the bedroom door, though Cary stays behind to linger a moment with Nikki
Bill takes a pillow from the sofa and tosses it across the room
He proceeds to leap feet first onto the sofa, fall on his back with his feet in the air, then stretch his legs out across the sofa, lying down to go to sleep
(satisfied) Ah
Shep, watching this, scratches his head, confused, then moves to join him
Frink watches Francis drag some sort of heavy fringed rug to the floor near the sofa, apparently preparing to lie down on it
Nikki and Cary stand close, exchanging warm goodnights
(dead serious) Good night, Cary
(playful) Good night, Nikki
Cary, perhaps pleased with Nikki's attention to him, watches her withdraw into the bedroom and shut the door
He turns from the door to see: - Four men, happily situated, settling in for a night's sleep: Bill and Shep on the sofa, Frink on a chair, their three pairs of feet propped up on a table
Francis, his head on a pillow, lies on the floor, stretching his legs and yawning as only a narcoleptic can
Say
like this place
Say,  like this place, too
think it's swell
peers at them skeptically, hands on his hips
(o
s
) It suits me
You fellas think you're gonna here
(o
s
) Sure
(o
s
) Sure
Cary hears the bedroom door open behind him and turns to see: opening the door, wearing a robe, carrying a bottle of eau de Cologne and some towels
(innocently) Will somebody please scrub my back
- Excited again, Bill jumps to his feet, upsetting the others in the process
Will somebody scrub your back
Look out, boys
The men struggle to their feet and follow him to: holds the bottle in her hand
The men's hands reach for it but Bill is quicker than the others and commandeers it with authority
got it,  got it,  got it
From over Nikki's nearly bare back, we watch Bill whistling jauntily as he shakes eau de Cologne onto a towel
now seated, watches this coolly as he takes out a cigarette and lights it
Bill examines Nikki's back with delight
(impressed) Mmmmmm mm
His eyes pop
For Nikki, though, this is an asexual activity
Scrub hard
Bill places her head on his left shoulder and prepares to scrub with his right
Did anyone ever see such a back in their life
He scrubs a little
Did anyone ever  of such a thing
More scrubbing -- his tongue sticks out of his mouth as he studies his work
, watch all this with envy and interest
(o
s
) Just look at that back
Just look at that thing, won't you
Bill keeps scrubbing, adopting the air of a professional back scrubber
Harder
He lifts her hair to inspect her neck
My, my
He scrubs her neck
could go on doin' this a long time
More scrubbing and then an amusing pantomime: To Nikki's bewilderment, Bill pulls back the hair over her ear, looks down into her ear, cleans it out with his little finger, flicks wax off his finger daintily, buffs the ear with the towel, and finally blows sharply into the ear, causing her to wince
She places her head on his shoulder again
More scrubbing
- We start on Cary, who sits rocking in a tilted chair and smoking, watching Bill and Nikki with amusement
After a pause: Nikki
Are you rich
Well, practically
Beulah is rich
Well, just how rich  your mother
Leave a lady a few secrets, can't you
By now, we've pulled back far enough to take in the whole group
Bill finishes his scrubbing and Nikki adjusts her robe
Thank you, William
That was  so cool and nice
(takes bottle and towels from him) Good night
Good night
(to the others) Good night
Good night, Nikki
They watch her move off
We hear the bedroom door close
Bill realizes something, snaps his fingers, claps his hands and starts off
Come on, fellas
He rushes off
Shep, Francis and Frink rise and follow
Cary merely collects his hat and cane and heads for the front door
- Bill and Shep carry the sofa over and place it directly in front of Nikki's closed bedroom door
Francis brings his rug and pillow
watches them, amused, from the front door
You're gonna stay here, huh
- The men settle in for the night
(to Cary) That's right
She might need some more help
Bill waves good night and collapses on the sofa
Frink, glancing at Cary, brings his chair and sits in it
Francis lies on the floor
Shep fluffs pillows on the sofa, etc
turns, shuts off the lights, opens the front door and exits the darkened room, closing the door behind him
- The drinking hole in Nikki's hotel
French woman noisily arranges dirty drinking glasses as Bill, Francis and Shep enter -- horribly hungover, moaning and yawning -- and line up at the bar
bartender greets them to take their order
Messieurs
Morning
Morning
Um, prairie oyster
Prairie oyster
Shep has to nudge Francis with an elbow
Prairie oyster
Prairie oyster for three
Bartender moves off
Shep puts on his dark eyeglasses
- We start on a   of three drinking glasses as the bartender breaks a raw egg into one
Beside them are the other ingredients of a potent hangover remedy
We   to the three men: Say, we'd better get back to our hotel
There's no Nikki at our hotel
That's right
And the bar doesn't open so early
Say
Why don't we move in here
Sure
Let's stay here
But - what about Cary
(to Shep) What about Cary
(to Francis) What  Cary
Francis shakes his head, he has no idea
We can move him in, too
Francis nods in agreement
Shep thinks it over as the drinks arrive
Not a bad idea
Shep pays off the bartender who departs with a mumbled "thank you
" The three men each down their nasty hangover cures in a single swallow and move off one at a time -- first Shep who exhales deeply, then Francis who takes it in stride
Finally, Bill exhales happily and claps his hands as he follows the others out, their hangovers apparently remedied
(cheerfully) Well, come on, men
Let's go
'  - Phonograph music plays as an Asian maid, the hotel's specialist in Chinois Pedicure, paints Nikki's toenails
We   to discover Nikki wearing a robe, sitting in a chair next to the phonograph, smoking a cigarette and checking on the progress of her paint job
snappy knock at the door
(wearily) Entrez
opens and Bill, looking dapper, enters
Hi, Nik
Then, Shep enters, wearing his dark eyeglasses and carrying a bouquet of flowers
Hello, Nikki
Next, Francis enters, sleepily
(in mid-yawn) Hello
Finally, Cary, who closes the door behind him
Good morning, Nikki
The men are all: wearing suits and ties, pleased to see her, and stone sober
Francis finds his way to the sofa, which has been returned to its proper spot in the room
He lies down and shuts his eyes
(o
s
) Hello, Bill
Hello, Shep
Hello, Cary
Hello, Francis
(from the sofa) Morning, Nikki
didn't expect to see you all so early
Shep puts the flowers in a vase
We camped on your doorsteps last night
And this morning we all moved in
Cary leans over her affectionately
Despite your practically innumerable faults, we adore you
We've decided to adopt you
Bill and Shep kneel next to Nikki
Bill notices the toenail painting
Well, for heaven's sakes
Look at Nikki
What are you having done to yourself, gal
Whatcha having your toes painted for, Nikki
Cary stands behind Nikki as she looks down at her toes
don't know
(looks at Bill and Shep) Seemed like a good idea at the time
Cary smiles
Nikki, Bill and Shep share a laugh
The Asian woman goes right on painting as Bill and Shep study Nikki's legs
During this, Nikki hands her cigarette to Cary who moves to put it in an ashtray by the window
Why, look at Nikki's legs, would you
That there is practically the loveliest pair of legs  ever saw in all my born days
Like my legs
Cary stares out the window at a rainy day
Look at those legs, Cary
My, they nearly match
Cary turns from the window
Did you ever see such a swell set of legs
Well, what do you want me to do about it
Burst into tears
Would it embarrass you, Nikki, if Cary were to burst into tears
(looks at her legs) On account of my legs
Oh
(turns to Cary, heartfelt) think that would be sweet
Cary manages a slight grin
As he does, there's a knock at the door
Everyone hollers, "Entrez
" Shep runs to the door and opens it
Oh, boy
Here come the drinks
The others cheer happily
Two hotel employees enter carrying trays loaded with already poured drinks
Shep hands a glass to Nikki
Here, Nikki, drink this
Make you laugh and play
That's what  want to do, laugh and play
Shep hands Bill a glass
Francis sits groggily on the sofa, a drink in each hand
He polishes off one and then the other
He leans over and sets one empty glass on the floor but holds on to the other as he puts his head to the nearby pillow and dozes off
Cary, Bill and Shep crowd around Nikki who is still seated -- all have drinks
The tray-carrying hotel employees have apparently exited
Bill proposes a toast
Here's to Nikki's dainty legs
As smooth and hairless as an egg
Wheee
Hurray
'Ray
They drink
Another knock at the door
They all yell, "Entrez
" The door opens to reveal Frink -- whose face falls when he sees the other men with Nikki
The others are not happy to see him, either
Well
Here comes that licentious old man
Who invited him
Cary hands his glass to Bill and moves to meet Frink as he enters
(sneering) Still drinking
(shakes his head mockingly) How can you tell
Cary watches Frink approach Nikki
Morning, Nikki
After a pause, Nikki looks up at him uncertainly as if she doesn't recognize him
Then she peers at him through her lorgnette
Oh, it's you
(after a pause, reluctantly polite) Won't you sit down
Thank you
Frink moves off to find a chair
Shep sets down his drink and follows him
Frink starts to move a chair but Shep stops him
Say,  don't think Nikki likes you
Oh, no
No
What do you wanna hang around for
Well, what do  hang around for
Me
Why,  came to bring Nikki some posies
'll bet you didn't bring Nikki any posies
-- Well-- During the above dialogue, Bill nudges Cary mischievously and they glance down at the tray in front of them
They exchange knowing nods, pick up some drinks, bring them over, and offer one to Frink
Have a drink
No, thanks
Cure the shakes
haven't got the shakes
Let's see
Hold out your hands
Bill and Shep watch with interest as Frink holds out his hands, palms up
No, turn them over
Frink turns them over, palms down
Cary looks at Frink's steady hands, impressed
Say, that's pretty good
Cary looks down at the drink in his own hand
Let's see if you can hold this
Cary sets the glass on top of Frink's downturned hand
Frink balances the full glass with ease
Say, that's great
Cary places a second full glass on Frink's other hand
Frink balances both glasses with ease
Cary expresses keen admiration
Steady as a rock
Frink looks at the others, a little smugly
Cary slowly backs away and walks off, as do the others
Frink's face falls as he realizes he has been left standing in the middle of the room with two drinks balanced on top of his hands and no way to safely remove them
Cary, Shep and Bill return to Nikki and crowd around her
Well,  guess that'll keep his hands out of mischief for a while
Frink, abandoned, reluctantly pleads with the others
Hey
Take these off
But the others simply ignore him
Now, let's see
Where were we before we were so rudely interrupted
We were talkin' about Nikki's legs
That's right
We were talkin' about Nikki's legs
And havin' a fine time, too
The Asian maid who has been working on Nikki's feet abruptly rises
Finis
The men cheer, "Yay
" and Nikki smiles at the woman as she exits with her tools
The men crowd closer to peer down at Nikki's legs
Let's inspect the job
But Nikki quickly covers her toes with a hand
Oh, my poor toes
Don't look too close
Nikki wraps her robe around her legs and stuffs them under body
Since she's no longer using her footstool, Cary commandeers it and sits on it
Well, what's the matter with your toes
Nikki grows extremely somber and begins to tell a story -- very slowly
Her eyes stare into space and her voice conveys terrible sadness
Well
when  was a little girl
worried look crosses Cary's face
my mother bought me a new pair of shoes
And they were  too short
Shep and Bill listen soberly
And  had to walk all the way to Sunday school and back
Down the road
And it was hot and dusty
(hand to his face) Oh, take her away
She's breakin' my heart
(sobs) And when  got home
my toes were spoiled
(on the verge of tears) Oh, dear, oh, dear
That's such a sad story
Let's all have a drink, quick
Their eyes pop
The men jump up eagerly and run off
Nikki, thoroughly nonplussed by this, takes a sip of her drink
Shep, Cary and Bill crowd around a tray and start imbibing
Meanwhile, Frink looks around unsuccessfully for a way to lose the two glasses that are still balanced on his hands
For the first time in this scene, Nikki is on her feet
She walks over to the drink tray and puts a friendly hand on the shoulders of Shep and Cary
And now would you all excuse me
On account of 'm gonna put on a dress
Well, why not
Nikki walks off, exiting into her bedroom
The men continue to stand around the tray, drinking
In the background, Francis sleeps on the sofa
Over by the fireplace, a frustrated Frink, still balancing the two drinks, casts a dirty look at the others
He angrily hurls the glasses into the fireplace, smashing them loudly
Francis, startled awake by the noise, jumps off the sofa
The others stare at him
My, my
What's  getting so excited about
Frink, furious, rubs his hands with a handkerchief and stuffs it in his pocket
You guys think you're so darn smart
Shep, Bill and Cary laugh at this
Cary consults his pocket watch
Well, cheerio, fellas
'm off
Bill waves goodbye
Cary eats a last olive, tosses the toothpick and heads for the front door
See ya later
Cary exits as Nikki's voice drifts in from: (o
s
) What are the plans for the day
Shep, drink in hand, enters and leans on the wall outside the door
Well, on account of it's raining and everything, we thought we'd go over to the Cluny and play billiards and drink beer
(o
s
) How about Cary
Went to get his hat and coat
He's going to Pere Lachaise
(o
s
) Pere Lachaise
What's Pere Lachaise
cemetery
How 'bout you coming with us
(o
s
) No
'm going with Cary
(concerned) You've been invited
Nikki appears in the doorway, dressed to go out
Do you think Cary might object
Well,  have an idea he'd like to be alone
Why alone
Well, Cary likes to be alone
He's as brittle as a breadstick
One silly crack from you and he might break up in sections
(thinks about this) Well, then,  don't think he should be left alone
(beat) Tell me, what's Cary doing in Paris
What are we all doing in Paris
know
But why doesn't he go home
Well, he's not ready to go home
What could he do if he went home
Have people cry over his hands
Well, it seems - a pity to go on like this
He's such a sweet soul
One of the best
Isn't he just sort of wasting himself
On the contrary
He's trying awfully hard to get hold of himself
Lost in thought, Nikki moves off and a worried Shep follows her to: Shep stops Nikki from leaving
She's a little downcast as he admonishes her: Now, listen
If you tag along, for heaven's sake, be careful what you say
Don't start getting sorry for him and don't cry over him
(with a chuckle) And, above all, don't make any unfortunate remarks, hear
(earnest) Oh,  won't
Why, who ever heard of such a thing
Nikki opens the front door and exits into: where Cary -- carrying coat, hat and cane -- emerges from a suite across the hall from Nikki's and heads for the elevator
He stops when he hears Nikki calling to him
She runs to join him
Cary
Cary
'm coming with you
Without waiting for a reply, she starts for the elevator, then stops to look down at her shoes
Oooh
(to Cary) Ooh, wait for Nikki
She leaves him and runs back to: of her suite where Shep still stands
He watches with surprise as Nikki runs in
(calls back to Cary) Wait for Nikki
Puzzled, Shep follows Nikki who rushes to: Nikki draws the curtain to reveal her enormous collection of dresses and shoes
Shep, drink in hand, wanders in slowly and leans against the doorjamb as he watches Nikki pull off one pair of shoes and put on a seemingly identical pair of red ones
What are you changing your shoes for
On account of  can walk faster in red shoes
Shep watches her hop and scurry off
- - Passerbys carry umbrellas on this rainy day
taxi cab pulls up to a sidewalk cafe --  , according to the awning that covers the little iron tables
Cary emerges from the cab and pays off the driver as Nikki hurries under the awning
Cary joins her and, after a word to the driver ("Restez ici
"), looks at the rain
(to Nikki) Perhaps we'd better stay here a while till it clears up
Could we sit down here, do you suppose
think so
Would you like something to drink
They move toward the cafe
As Cary hangs up his hat, a waiter arrives
What should  drink now, do you suppose
Cary orders the drinks as Nikki moves to sit at a table
(to the waiter) Deux picon citrons
The waiter acknowledges this and heads inside, calling out the order to his bartender
Cary joins Nikki at the table and sits down
She removes her gloves and fixes her face while he takes out a cigarette and lights it under the following: Picon citrons
Very refreshing
Make you laugh and play
(amused) That's what you always promise
(suddenly serious) Cary, why does Shep Lambert go on drinking so desperately
Don't we all
Not like Shep
Well, Shep has that tic under his eye, you know
Takes a lot of drinks to keep that quiet
But isn't there some kind of treatment or something
Shep could never stand a long course of treatment
Drinking's the only corrective so far as he's concerned
He's found out the tic doesn't work when he's tight
So he stays tight
The waiter arrives with the drinks
As he spritzes seltzer water into their glasses, Cary leans over to light a cigarette for Nikki
The waiter leaves and they drink
Seems such a pity
How did he get the tic
In the war
know
But how
Well, it's not very romantic
Well, don't tell me if you don't want to
Well, you see, a tic is a nervous habit
Yes
Lice under his bandages
Oh
He had the devil of a time
He nearly lost his mind
So you'll have to excuse him a little
'm so sorry for Shep
Well, don't let him know it
Well, isn't he going home
Not ever
Not ever
Not in his dark glasses anyway
Can't something be done for him
He'll have to be - reborn
How's he going to end
Well, how are you going to end
How am  going to end
How is going to end
How's your picon citron go
It goes fine
But doesn't make any difference to you
Not now
long time ago, perhaps, when  was a little boy
Tell me, where were you little
In Minnesota
On a farm
Were you happy then, Cary
think so
Tell me, what  there to be happy about on a farm in Minnesota
(lost in thought) Ohhh, thorn-apple trees in blossom
The smell of burning leaves in the fall
The sound of horses' hoofs on the road
(looks at Nikki) Did you ever dig up an Indian mound or uncover a nest of baby field mice
Or explore old trunks in an attic
Listen to the moaning of the telephone wires in the winter wind
See a gypsy caravan
(enthralled) So ' why you were happy
On account of apple blossoms and field mice and telephone wires and gypsy caravans and old trunks and things
That's right
Nikki exhales, drinks, looks at Cary and shakes her head
But aren't you going back
Not ever
Would you like another picon citron before you go
The rain is lifting
Nikki finishes the last of her drink
No
'm ready now
Cary leaves some money, Nikki gathers her things
They rise and walk off
: - Cary and Nikki stroll into view, arm in arm, and look around
The rain has stopped
They are the only living people in the ancient cemetery
Who all is buried here
Oh, poets, painters, philosophers-- Cocoanut
No cocoanut
Poets, painters, philosophers, musicians
They've paused
Cary looks around, points with his cane
There's Chopin
Oh,  practiced him
He gives her a look and they move on
And there's Balzac
And there's Heloise and Abelard
Oh, tell me about Abelise and Eloard
No, Nikki
Not Abelise and Eloard
Heloise and Abelard
'm sorry
really didn't do it on purpose
It was on account of the picon citron
Tell me about Heloise and Abelard
Well, they're buried here in the same sepulchre side by side
Why are they buried side by side
They stop
They were the world's most famous lovers
(looks off, points with his cane) There's the tomb
They approach the large tomb which is fenced off by a low iron gate
Cary removes his hat, Nikki peers at the double sepulchre through her lorgnette
Tell me about the world's most famous lovers
Well, Abelard was a scholastic philosopher-- Whatever that is
Whatever that is
He gained a footing in a certain household as tutor to a maiden called Heloise
And employed his unlimited opportunities for the purpose of-- Well, betrayal
Not, however, unmixed with real love
He carried her off to Brittany
Tell me more
Well, her uncle was furious
He blamed Abelard for the whole thing
He conceived a terrible revenge
(uneasy) 'm afraid for Abelard
He broke into Abelard's apartment one night and perpetrated upon him the most brutal punishment
Oh, dear
The lovers were forced to live their lives apart
But when they died, they were buried here side by side
(peers down at the ground) There's a story that little heart- shaped stones are supposed to grow around the tomb
Heart-shaped stones
And lovers come and find them and exchange them with each other
(looks at Nikki) And, so long as you keep the stone from the tomb of Heloise and Abelard, no harm can come to your true love
How perfectly beautiful
Isn't that a quaint legend
They crouch at the iron bars of the gate surrounding the tomb and take off their gloves under the following: Do you think  might find a heart- shaped stone
You help me, Cary
All right, Nikki
Only we have to leave soon
(looks off) They close up the place
Just as soon as we find our stones
They reach through the gate to poke at the rocks and gravel surrounding the tomb
After a moment, Nikki rises and walks off excitedly with a stone in her hand
found one
Where's yours
Cary, too, finds a stone and rises to join her
' as the couple sits near the tomb
They show each other the stones in their upturned hands
Nikki takes the heart-shaped stone from her palm and places it in Cary's stiff, weathered hand
Then she transfers his stone to her hand
And, now, you take mine
And 'll take yours
They close their hands over the stones as we   to a   of Nikki and Cary smiling at one another
Isn't that the way the story goes
That's right, Nikki
And, now, no harm can come to our true love
(amused) And, now, we'll have to go
He starts to rise but she puts a hand on his arm
You were so nice to let me come with you
spoiled your whole day
You were going to do something else, weren't you
(looks away) Doesn't matter
Well, what was it, Cary
Why did you come here today
(not looking at her) To pay my respects to an old comrade
Oh
And you wanted to be alone
'm sorry
Oh, 'm so sorry
(begins to weep softly) Don't pay any attention to me, Cary
can't help it
You  me cry
He stares at her, astonished, as she rambles on
Oh, don't look so troubled, Cary
'm all right
just want to cry for a minute
(puts a hand on his shoulder) On account of you're so nice
You're so clean, Cary
And your teeth are so white
You're so civilized
You don't care about anything any more, nor anybody
Nothing makes any difference to you
Nothing can touch you
(realizes) Why, you're lost
You're  lost
You and Shep and the rest of you
(takes his hand) Oh,  want to do something for you
want to help you
(looks at his wrist) Let me wash your bracelet, Cary
(points) Why, see
The silver's all tarnished
The silver's all tarnished
(removes his bracelet) 'll take it with me and scrub it when  get home
'll polish it with my nail-brush
Nikki turns to put the bracelet in her purse
Thoroughly unnerved by this emotional outburst, Cary looks around
It's getting dark
Cary rises, deeply uncomfortable
Nikki tries to make amends
Well
(rises, cheerily) Anyway, we found a name for my turtles
Cary turns and looks at her, amazed
Heloise and Abelard
name for your turtles
So that's what you were looking for
might have known how it would end
He looks down at the heart-shaped stone held awkwardly in his stiff hand
His thumb brushes the stone and it falls to the ground
: '  - Nikki sits, soberly polishing Cary's bracelet with her nail brush
Shep enters, drink in hand
Hi, Nik
She looks at Shep forlornly
(sadly) Hello
Shep walks over and confronts her
Cary's in a state
Says he's going away
Can't stand it any longer and all that sort of thing
(sits on the bed) What happened between you two, anyway
Cary seemed so sad and everything -- on account of 'd taken up his whole afternoon
(sighs) So little Nikki said, all merry and bright, "Well, anyway, we'd found a name for my turtles
" name for the turtles
Shep cracks up with laughter and falls backward on the bed, his head dangling over the edge
That's funny
Shep keeps laughing, twists around on the bed and sits up again
Name for the turtles
That's so funny, all right
Shep holds a hand to his head and catches his breath as Nikki joins him on the bed
Why do you always  to be funny at the wrong time
Didn't  tell you Cary was brittle
How did he respond to  line
(morosely) Pulled down the iron curtain
Shep cracks up again
Worried, Nikki tugs at his sleeve
Did he say he was going away
(through his laughter) Yup
Gotta get away from it all
Then, you've got to go to him right now
Nikki rises and urgently pulls Shep, helpless with laughter, to his feet
And explain that  didn't mean it
Tell him how it was and everything
Listen-- No, go on
You go right now before it's too late
She pushes him toward the door
But Nikki--
You go right straight to Cary
They exit
: '  - Cary removes clothes from a rack as a now serious Shep, drink in hand, stands nearby trying to reason with him
Now, listen, Cary, you don't have to behave like an old Easter egg
You're breaking Nikki's heart
She doesn't know any better
She doesn't know any better
Well, whether she does or not, 'm going a long ways away from Nikki
Nikki and her turtles
Whew
You sure are in an uproar
What  need is a drink
Cary packs a weathered suitcase
need more than a drink
need a lot of geography between me and that girl
Where do you want to go
Anywheres
So long as it's a long way from Nikki
(pauses, looks at Shep) You know -- that girl does things to me
(back to packing) 've got to get away
Well,  wonder what's happening in Portugal tonight
Cary stops packing and gives Shep a look
Say
(thinks it over) wonder what  happening in Portugal tonight
Shep stares at Cary, astonished, and moves off
Cary sets his packed suitcase upright
: '  - Bill and Shep set a large steamer trunk upright
Heave ho
Bill opens the trunk
Ah
There you go
Nikki appears, carrying a suitcase
If Cary's going to Portugal, why can't we go to Portugal, too
Ain't we got any rights
Sure we got rights
Getting organized for their own impromptu Portuguese expedition, Bill, Francis and Shep fill the trunk with Nikki's things as Frink leans on it, smoking a cigarette and eyeing Nikki coolly
Cary better not think he can screw up in Portugal and leave old Shep behind
Say, when's he leaving
Ten-thirty in the morning
Sud Express
Don't we have to have passports and things
Sure we gotta have passports
Bill joins Nikki
What kind passports you like
What kind passports you got
We have ebony, cocoanut, thornberry passports
(grandly) 'll take vanilla
She brushes past him and crosses to a table where she is joined by Frink
Good night, Nikki
'll see you on the train
You're goin', too
Why not
(with a sly smile) might, uh, pick up a couple of features for my paper - in Portugal
Frink walks out the door
Nikki sighs a little and then busies herself with carrying items the trunk
Shep arrives with a selection of dresses as the group crowds together
Chaotic overlapping dialogue: Nikki, do you want --
Did you put all my shoes in
You bet
There they are-- don't know how you're going to get all these dresses in, Nikki
From the trunk, we : '  - mountain of trunks and other luggage piled on the floor
Nikki sits down near Shep who finishes packing a suitcase on the floor
Don't we have to go like anything
The train leaves in twenty minutes
Francis leans casually on the towering pile of luggage
Bill stands next to him, smoking a cigarette and calling ironically to Nikki: Are you  you have everything
(misses the irony) -  think so
Francis clicks his tongue as he regards the pile
(dryly) Hardly seems enough
Suddenly, Nikki gasps and rises
Oh, my turtles
My turtles
are plucked from the tub and placed in
by Nikki's little Asian maid
The fancy beribboned wicker basket has an oversized handle which makes it a rather improbable turtle carrier
Bill secures a wire mesh covering over the basket and carries it out of the bathroom, handing it grandly to Francis
Here you are, Francis
You're the custodian of the turtles
Now don't fall down on the job
Bill walks off
Francis calls after him, worried: Hey
never tended turtles before
Nikki arrives with a bottle of water and soaks her hand
Now, all you have to do - She gives Francis the bottle and sprinkles the turtles with water from her wet hand
- is to sprinkle 'em now and then, like this
Oh, yeah
see
Some of the water ends up in Francis' eye which he wipes with the basket's ribbon
Nikki walks off and Francis practices soaking his hand and sprinkling the turtles
Five bellhops march in and, under the direction of Nikki and the men, proceed to carry off the luggage, chattering in French
Well, we're off
(to a bellhop, about the trunk) Be careful of that one
Burdened with luggage, the bellhops file out through the suite
Bill, suitcase in hand, follows them out, beckoning to Francis behind him
Uh, come on, Francis
Take those turtles
Francis hurries along carrying the basket, followed by Shep and Nikki
- whistle
Their luggage already aboard, Francis, Nikki, Shep and Bill walk down the platform, parallel to the train
Bill claps his hands exuberantly
There she is, boys
The Sud Express
Can you imagine Cary tryin' to run away and leave us behind
Bill laughs
Nikki peers at the train through her lorgnette
Do you suppose he's really gonna be here
Sure he'll be here
He's never missed a train in his life
Say, do you suppose the turtles'll be all right with that porter
Bill gives Francis a supportive pat on the back
Aw, sure they'll be all right
All you got to do is - (gestures with his hand) - sprinkle 'em
Francis nods soberly
Bill laughs
Nikki points, excited
There he is
Cary buys a paper from a newsboy and steps onto his train
(o
s
) Say, Cary
On the train steps, Cary stops and turns as his friends arrive and gather around him, grinning
Hello, Cary
(surprised) Well, hello
What are you all doing down here
We just came down to see you off is all
Well, that's darn decent of you
Ya got a nice seat
Yeah, right by a window
Oh, how nice for you
(with childlike desire) Come on
Show us your seat by the window
(cheerful, insistent) Yeah, come on, Cary
We wanna that seat by the window
Climbing the steps, Bill and Shep crowd a confused Cary and force him into the train
Following the others, Francis helps Nikki up the steps
Come on, Nikki
They all board the train and head for: '  - The group crowds into the small compartment
My, my, what a swell train
Sud Express, Train de Luxe
Say, wonder if a chap can get a drink on this train
Sure
don't see why not
Push the button
Bill pushes a button for the porter
(flustered) Well, 'm afraid you won't have time for a drink
We're gonna start in a minute
You'll have to get off
Everyone but Cary grabs a seat
Astonished, Cary stares at each as they speak: Get off
Gosh, no
We  this train
This is a Train de Luxe
Yes, we like trains de luxe, don't we, Nikki
Sure
Trains de luxe is what we like
The whistle
Cary panics
Hey
He's blowing the whistle
(grabs Shep's shoulder) Hey, we're gonna start
Well, let her start
The trains starts
Bill jauntily throws his hat up to the luggage rack above and the others settle in for their journey
Let 'er go Gallagher
Who cares
Who cares
Who cares
Who cares
Frink enters casually
Hello, everybody
Cary is stunned
Frink sits down with the others
And you, too
That's right
The group takes in the train's departure with perfect composure
Cary stands and looks at them for a moment before breaking into a understanding grin
That's right
Who cares
Cary sits
As the train hurtles out of the now empty station, Nikki suddenly turns to the window and waves goodbye to no one at all: Goodbye
Goodbye
Don't forget to write
Shep, Bill and Francis quickly join in, waving and shouting goodbye, much to Cary's amusement
Even Frink manages a smile at this
: ' racing down the track
: '  - The compartment doorway
We hear the men laughing
Bill -- drink in hand, his necktie loosened and his coat off -- appears in the doorway, coming from the train's corridor
Hi, men
Look what  found
With a grand gesture, Bill presents an elderly British gentleman who follows him into the little room, greeted with a cheer of "Hooray
" from the men who sit around, similarly coatless (save Frink), smoking and drinking
Various bottles stand on a central table
The old gentleman is greeted warmly but it's never clear whether he is an old friend or a total stranger
Come in
Sit down
Have a drink
Ah, thank you, no, not
Bill and the old gentleman sit down
Nikki dozes in her seat by the window
The basket of turtles hangs from above
-  say, are you all going to Portugal
Yup
We're going down there to investigate conditions
Investigate conditions
Drinking conditions, mostly
By the way, what  conditions
Don't you know what conditions are
No
Never saw one in my life
The drinking conditions are pretty bad right here
(chuckles skeptically, glancing at the bottles) Ahh, indeed
My beer's full of cinders
Good for ya
Make ya lay hard-shelled eggs
The men laugh
whistle
The conductor appears briefly in the doorway to announce in French that the mademoiselle's compartment is ready
Nikki
The man says your compartment's ready
Nikki wakes, rises, and clutching her pillow, heads for the doorway
'm glad -- on account of it's been so hot and 'm so tired and  want to go to bed
Going to bed
Who ever heard of such a thing
Bill rises to confer with her at the door
Can we help you undress
No, thank you, William
The old gentleman looks rather astonished at this casual exchange
Take off your shoes
Undo your hair
Scrub your back or something
No,  can manage quite well by myself
Good night, everybody
The men say, "Good night
" Frink, who has been watching Nikki with a predatory eye, is the most polite: Good night, Nikki
Nikki turns and disappears down the corridor
The old gentleman mops his brow with a handkerchief and stuffs it in his collar
Can you imagine that ungrateful old trollop
She wouldn't let them help her undress
Can't understand it at all
You know, she's not very pretty
But when she was a little girl, her mother always said she had the nicest hair-ribbons
Indeed
She got one tooth turned around, she can't see very far, and she's speaking out of turn
Otherwise, she's a mighty fine piece of architecture
Mm, seems to need a few repairs
During the next exchange, Frink, seated by the door, grins at Bill and Shep, then notices Francis dozing off
Frink cautiously rises and exits into the corridor without anyone noticing his departure
She's got eyes like an Assyrian Queen's got eyes
You ain't never seen no Assyrian Queen
You're just a-makin' that up outta yore own head
did  see an Assyrian Queen
In whose green hat
In the Metropolitan Museum's green hat, that's whose green hat
Francis' pocket watch
He wakes, rises, puts on his hat and moves absently toward the door
Seeing this, Shep, Bill and Cary shout at him: "Whoa
" Francis pauses in the doorway and sleepily turns to the others
Hold on there
Where you goin'
You're not going anywhere
You're on a train
Sorry
You go back to your turtles, hear
You've been neglecting your assignment
Francis moves to the hanging basket of turtles, takes off his hat and, bottle in hand, wets his fingers and sprinkles the turtles
Curious, the old gentleman rises to join him
Francis explains as he works: have to sprinkle the turtles, see
Sprinkle the turtles
Sure
The old gentleman nods and clicks his tongue with understanding
Cool 'em off
Hm
Turtles get feverish on trains
Ahh
Uh huh
woman's  drifts in from the corridor
' Cary
What's that
Hm
The men hear Nikki
Nikki
Francis, Cary, Bill and Shep -- in that order -- scramble out the door, leaving the old gentleman behind
' Cary
Bill
Shep
The men rush down the corridor to: '  - Frink grapples with a half-dressed Nikki, his lips pressed to her neck as she struggles to free herself from his grasp
Cary
Energized by Nikki's peril, Francis bursts in and pulls Frink away from her
Say
Nikki grabs a wrap from the turned-down bed and covers herself as Frink pushes Francis hard into a nearby wall, knocking him to the floor
Get out of here
Frink turns back to a defiant Nikki as Cary enters and sees a dazed Francis slumped against the wall, clutching his head
Cary grabs Frink's shoulder and spins him around
Say, what's the idea
What's the idea
Well, what business is that of yours
By now, Bill and Shep have entered and joined the tense confrontation
Nikki, you all right
What is this tough trying to do to you anyway
Well,  was just going to bed and he came in and flang himself all over me
Frink, you'd better get out of here right away before something happens to you
What right have you to tell me to get out of here
This isn't your compartment, is it
Oh,  see
You wanna argue about it
If you don't clear out of here right now, you're liable to get hurt
All right
Suppose you put me out
(savagely) Put him out
'll snap his spine and throw him off the train
Cary rolls his eyes at this remark and wisely holds Bill back
Hold everything, Bill
Distraught, Nikki sinks down on a chair
Oh, dear, does everybody have to act like this
Frink turns to her in protest
'm not gonna let these silly drunks tell  where to get off
Silly drunks
Silly drunks, did you say
Yes
And that goes for the whole bunch of you
Let me have him
(to Bill) Wait a minute
'll take care of him
You will, eh
Frink starts to strong-arm Cary
Cary punches Frink in the jaw, knocking him onto the bed
Socko
As Frink slumps down to floor and leans against the bed, half-conscious, Francis rises and watches the proceedings with a hand on his head
Oh, dear
Cary, fist still tightly clenched, stands over the dazed Frink as Bill brightens considerably and wipes his hands with delight
Mm
Now, ain't that nice
Have you ever seen anything so cute
Francis exits uncertainly
Will you be all right now, Nikki
(unsure) Uh huh
(to Bill and Shep) Grab hold of that fella and drag him out of here
Cary exits
Bill and Shep haul Frink to his feet
Come to papa
Nikki watches Bill and Shep lead Frink out the door
: '  - Francis sits by the window, rubbing his head
Cary arrives and sits down next to him
Cary takes Francis' water bottle and hands it to him
Here, Francis
Do your stuff
Bill and Shep carry Frink in and dump him on the seat opposite Francis
Bill walks off, wiping his hands happily
The others are grim, furious at Frink for his actions
Shep watches a disgusted Francis soak his hand and sprinkle Frink as if he were one of Nikki's turtles
Frink snaps out of his daze
Frink, don't you know better than to try a stunt like that
Oh,  -  lost my head over the girl is all
'm sorry
apologize
Well, you apologize to Nikki in the morning
And don't you ever get out of line again
The next time, it might be different
Francis pointedly sprinkles Frink one last time
They give each other a dark look
Francis fingers the neck of the water bottle as if he were going to use it to smash Frink in the face
As they glare ominously at one another, we ,  - Crowded city street
superimposed title reads: : Cocktail shaker in the hands of an expert who shakes it rhythmically as appropriate Latin  begins
This   a kaleidoscopic  of our protagonists enjoying the night life: Nikki's image dominates at the center, surrounded by images of the men in dinner clothes
Everyone drinks, except Frink who smokes a cigarette and stares, desirous and snakelike, presumably at Nikki
Nikki and her war birds (minus Frink) seated at a bar in an otherwise empty club late at night, wearing goofy party hats
They swallow a last drink and start to leave -- laughing, talking, merrily blowing little party horns, taking a bottle or two with them, and waving to an unseen bartender as they go
Someone says, "Good night
" We   for a closer look at the bar, covered with many empty glasses
And the music and the montage end
: '   - Cary, wearing a robe, sees Shep still asleep in bed
Cary puts on a party hat, sits on the edge of his own bed opposite Shep's, picks up a party horn and blows into it, hard
The horn  horribly
Shep wakes with a start and sits up in bed, completely unnerved
Cary laughs at him and, with his clenched hands, picks up a bottle
Wake up, ya big sissy
(pours a drink) Here, drink this
It'll make you laugh and play like any old thing
Shep groans and sighs as Cary hands him a glass with his fists
Say, Cary, what day is this
It's Wednesday
Wednesday
Wednesday what
The twentieth
What month,  mean
You mean to say you don't know what month this is
knew once but  forgot
Well, it's June
The merry month of June
June
Say, maybe  better get up
Cary looks at Shep, amused
What town are we in
You're in Lisbon, Portugal
Lisbon
That's where  thought it was
just wanted to check up is all
(a little concerned) Say, what's the matter with you, Shep
Don't you really know where you are or what day it is
kind of lose track of things
Say, this is getting serious
Cary lets the goofy hat fall off his head into his hand and sets it aside
Serious
Is anything serious any more
Well, it's serious when you don't know where you're at
What's gonna become of you
By now, Shep has polished off his drink
He sets down the empty glass
Oh, 'll be all right when 've had a couple of drinks
Say, what town did you say this was
just told you, Lisbon
Come on, now, pull yourself together, Shep
We gotta get organized for the bull-fight
Shep, excited, gets out from under the bedcovers
(like a little kid) Bull-fight
Are we going to a bull-fight
Sure
Portuguese bull-fight
Is that guy Frink coming along
'Fraid so
Gee, isn't there any way we can get rid of that guy
Somebody'll have to shoot him
Shep rises and walks off
Not a bad idea at that
Cary watches him go and blows his party horn, wryly
: - bugler blows his own horn, grandly, while standing before colorful bull- fight posters that read: crowd files in under an arched entranceway
Our little group enters, dressed for a day at the fights
Praca de Touros
And, sure enough, the words over a decorated archway read: wonder if there's a bar inside or anything
friendly, English-speaking Portuguese man named Pedro overhears this and joins them
Sure, there  a bar
Let's find the bar
We gotta get organized for the bull-fight
Right this way
Pedro leads and they happily follow
- Led by their guide, Pedro, the group files in and lines up at the bar
tiny, extremely drunken old man is the only other customer
Oh, boy
Lookit that bar, would ya
Isn't that a beautiful thing
What are you all gonna have
Beer is what  want
Beer
Beer
Beer
(orders) Cinco cervejas
Cinco cervejas
Nikki and Cary stand together at the bar
don't like beer
Make you leap like a tuna
Don't wanna leap like a tuna
Make you bark like a fox
Don't wanna bark like a fox
Make you laugh and play
That's what  wanna do
Laugh and play
(to the bartender) Hey
Vermouth
Bill, glass raised, proposes a toast
On the wall behind him is the shadow of the drunken old man, standing in roughly the same pose
Well, men, fire and fall back
As Bill drinks, the old man's shadow wobbles forward
Bill hears the sound of liquid
He stops drinking and looks puzzled
stream of liquid pours down onto Bill's right foot, soaking his sock and shoe
Bill turns to find the drunken old man leaning at an unsteady angle, the alcohol spilling steadily out of a glass in the man's hand and onto Bill's foot
Hey
What's the idea
The others, lined up at the bar, see this and laugh
The drunken old man brushes some lint off Bill's jacket as Bill shakes his pant leg, amused
Well,  hope  don't catch a cold in my left ear
Band  plays
Cary looks up, concerned
Hey, drink your drinks
We'll miss the parade
The group hurriedly finish and exit
Shep pays the tab
Bill, followed by the old man, shakes his pant leg and limps along after the others
: - The crowd  and the band  as a parade of matadors, picadors and banderilleros enters the ring
Led by their guide, Pedro, the group takes seats in the front row, back of the trenches
They have to sit close down so Nikki can see things
The drunken old man from the bar tags along behind Bill like a puppy dog and tries to sit next to him but Pedro pointedly directs him to a seat in the second row
When Bill rises to cheer the parade, the drunken old man also rises and taps him affectionately on the shoulder
Bill turns and greets him pleasantly, shaking his hand
Well
My old pal
The old man tips his hat to Bill and sits
Bill shakes his pant leg and gives the old man a wry look before also sitting
The parade ends
matador throws his montera (his black woolen hat) into the crowd
Cary catches the hat, much to the group's delight -- they shout "Hooray
" Immediately, a cape is hurled at Bill who drapes it over the railing before them
Cary offers the hat to Nikki
Nikki, here's a present for you
Oh, a hat
Oh, senor, no, no, no -- you must not keep the hat
You must put a little present in it and return it to the matador after the fight
What kind of present
Well, eh - a little jewelry
Something you have like the chain or the watch or the - the - the cigarette case or the cuff links or - or the-- Vanilla
Yes
Vanilla
trumpet
The crowd
Bill points, excited
Look
Here he comes
bull charges into view
Bull-fighter and bull face off
The bull makes ten passes, faster and closer each time
Bill sits next to Pedro
Nice work
Good work
What's so good about it
He works close to the bull
Is that so dangerous
Sure, it's dangerous
Bull-fighting is very dangerous
It takes a lot of courage to go into the bull ring
Bill scoffs and waves dismissively
Cary leans in with a query
Is it true the bull is blind when he charges
He sees only the cape -- perhaps
Bull-fighter and bull continue their duel
Finally, the bull gets the advantage and others must rush in to distract the bull
Bill is unimpressed
Bet  could run that bull bow-legged
You know,  should have  a bull-fighter
You should have started at twelve years of old
bet  could start right now
(puts a hand on Bill's shoulder) Sit still and behave yourself
Bull-fighting is not for Americans
You think we haven't got the nerve or something
Why, listen, bull-fighting is just for us, the Latins
He thinks we're a-scared
(helpfully) He tackled a horse once
(stares at Bill) Tackle a horse
Full of himself, Bill nods
(turns away; flatly) Is not the same
Everyone suddenly stares in shock as: the bull knocks down the matador
Others rush in to distract the bull which runs wild, out of control
Frink nudges Francis awake and points out the carnage in the ring
Francis glances at the spectacle briefly and then sleepily applauds
Frink gives him a look and nudges him to stop clapping
Francis simply goes back to sleep
The toreros try to control the bull but it refuses to cooperate
The crowd watches intently
Bill takes off his own hat and picks up the matador's cap that Cary had caught
Toreros scramble and run for their lives
The bull chases them down, runs across the ring, forcing them to jump the barrera, the protective wooden barrier that circles the inside of the arena
Bill, now wearing the cap, can't resist leaning over and mocking a group of toreros who huddle in the callejon, the safe side of the barrier, just below him
Nice work, Tony
Nice work, Joe
The toreros look up at Bill in surprise
One of them responds in Portuguese with a gesture toward the ring, as if to ask "If it's so easy, why don't you try it
" The other toreros laugh
Bill stares into the ring, a savage look in his eyes
He puts a leg up on the railing
He jumps down into the ring
' Hey
Cary rises, stunned
Bill
Come back here
But it is too late
Bill's coat is already off and he waves it like a cape as he stalks after the bull
The bull turns and sees him
Bill moves toward it, waving his coat and grinning like a madman
Shep is frozen
Beside him, Nikki screams and turns away
The bull begins to charge
Cary climbs over the railing
The bull charges
Bill who holds the coat before him -- big eyes, big grin
The bull is on him
The bull roars
Bill's face snaps backward in a blur, his coat follows
The bull gores him through his coat
His face twists in pain
as the bull knocks Bill's body around the ring like a rag doll
He hits the ground hard
Screams from the crowd
Four toreros rush in
They surround and distract the bull
Bill lies motionless
Cary runs across the ring
More toreros and others rush in, surrounding the bull, finally leading away
In the front row, Shep, Nikki, Francis, Frink and Pedro watch with concern as toreros converge on Bill and try to move his body
Cary joins them
Bill
But Bill is unconscious
torero says something to Cary in Portuguese
Cary and the others lift Bill
Take it easy
Take it easy
They carry Bill off
: - group of toreros straighten their gleaming spangled jackets and walk off to reveal Cary standing over a bloodied Bill and holding his hand as medical personnel prepare to operate
Bill lies flat on a table and smiles, amused with himself
Cary
slipped
Too bad
You were doing fine
Wasn't , though
Heh
It's a cinch
Bull-fighting
Just as easy-- Bill breaks off and raises his head to look at the doctor off screen
Hey, Doc
Be careful
What are you doing
To distract him, Cary pulls out a handkerchief and mops Bill's brow which glistens with sweat
You know why  slipped, Cary
No, Bill
Why
On account of that beer in my shoe
Bill breaks off and raises himself up again
Hey, Doc
Cary gently eases Bill's head back down
Cary, that bull certainly was hostile
Pedro escorts Shep (in his dark eyeglasses again) and Nikki into the room
The doctor, in surgical gear, puts on gloves and looks annoyed by the intrusion
You hurt, Bill
You all right, Bill
Sure
'm all right
was a big success
The doctor has some sharp words for Pedro who acknowledges this and approaches the others: He wants that we should go right away
Pedro exits
'm sure glad that  -  wore my new blue shorts
'll be a big success in the hospital
Nikki places a hand on his head
'll send you my turtles, Bill
And you'll be a big success
She turns away, trying not to cry
Shep follows her as they leave
So long, Bill
So long
Shep follows Nikki out
Goodbye, Bill
Bill reaches up and pats Cary on the shoulder
Cary looks at the doctor, then at Bill, before retreating to the door
He turns to look back at Bill who grins at him
See ya later - Cary
Cary can't return the smile
He turns and goes, closing the door behind him
Bill's attention turns to the doctor whose approaching shadow is cast on the wall behind him
Bill's smile fades
: - Cary emerges and joins the group who are gathered glumly on some steps
How is he
They've just put him to sleep
Nikki, emotionally fragile, hands Cary his hat
Why, thank you, Nikki
There's nothing you can do
You'd better go back to the hotel
(to Francis) Put Nikki in a taxi
We'll wait here
As Frink and Francis exit with Nikki, Pedro approaches Cary with a couple of journalists
Senor, the reporters want to know why your friend descend into the bull ring
Cary looks off and thinks for a moment
Tell them -- that it seemed like a good idea - at the time
Pedro stares at Cary in astonishment
Cary joins Shep and the two of them stand with their backs to the others as we - The amusement park at Port Mayer
Crowds, carnival , a carousel with appropriate
At a nearby refreshment stand, we find the group, minus Bill
Everyone is unusually silent and wearing dinner clothes
Francis holds a mug upside-down
Frink leers at Nikki who ignores him while she, Shep and Cary down their drinks
They hear: They look over to see: little shooting gallery where customers rent genuine guns to shoot various colorful targets and win prizes
Sounds like old times
Let's go and shoot
Not a bad idea
(to Nikki) What say, Annie Oakley
Like to fire off a gun at something
No objection
(to their bartender) We'll be right back
Hold everything
The group starts over to: where an assortment of rifles and pistols are neatly laid out
Cary and Shep escort Nikki to the arsenal while Frink and Francis tag along behind
An attendant joins them to collect their money and ready their weapons
First one to miss pays for the drinks
What'll we shoot at
Shoot one of those pussycats and see what happens
All right
Look out, pussycat
Shep  and misses the moving cats that float across the base of the range on an endless chain and disappear
But he hits a tinier target: a clay pipe behind them
Shep's eyes pop with surprise
Well, that's what  was aiming at, a clay pipe
(stares in amazement) Whole thing's been misrepresented to me
Cary laughs at him
Cary, let's see you shoot something
Cary takes careful aim
Look out, ball
He  and hits a ball balanced atop a stream of water
What'd  aim at
Well, let's see you shoot something
Nikki awkwardly raises her little target rifle to her shoulder
The end of the barrel describes uncertain circles in the air
multiple exposure point-of- view shot of the targets reveals that Nikki is a little too tipsy to be handling a gun
Cary moves to help her
Oh, no, no, no, Nikki
How do you hold it still
Listen, Nikki, on your right shoulder
Now, put your hand out there and hold up-- No, don't cover up the site
No, no, no, that's right
Now just hold it evenly-- Rapid
Cary looks up in surprise
He and Shep turn to watch in amazement as Francis cuts loose with an automatic rifle, shattering a whole row of pipes with split-second firing
The others cheer as Francis lowers the weapon and stares moodily at an astonished and, apparently, very drunk Frink
Cary takes this moment to encourage Nikki
You can do better than that
Show him up
She again tries unsuccessfully to hold the rifle steady
Amused, Frink picks up a pistol and imitates her
What are you waving at, Nikki
Cary sees Frink pointing his gun at Nikki and moves to intervene, grabbing Frink's wrist with both hands
(angry) Look out
Why, you fool
Don't you know better than that
Shep and Francis move to shield Nikki
What's the idea
Pointing a loaded gun at Nikki
Take your hands off me
Put down that gun
Let go of my wrist
Frink violently pulls free of Cary's grasp and, as he does, the gun goes off with a
Francis hurries Nikki to safety in the opposite direction
Shep backs away, clutching his side -- for a moment, it looks very much as if he's been hit
Cary pursues and confronts Frink
Put down that gun
Frink backs up to a nearby lamp post and, wielding the pistol, points it at Cary
His face is tense, savage
Listen, you keep your hands off me
've had enough from you
You try any more of your rough stuff on me--
nervous crowd of passersby pauses to watch the showdown
Oh, so that's how it is
thought we taught you how to behave
Frink, drunk and frustrated, starts to lose it completely
You taught  how to behave
Listen, you'd better behave now or you'll get hurt
(calmly) don't think so
'll give you three to put down that gun
It'll be just too bad if you don't
Too bad for who
Frink cocks the hammer
One
Cary moves slowly toward Frink
Keep away from me
'll shoot, tell ya
'll shoot
Two
Frink and Cary are less than a yard apart
'll shoot
'll shoot
Cary flinches
Frink drops the pistol, his face twisted in pain
He starts to fall
Nearby, Francis coolly  his rifle, pumping seven bullets into Frink
Members of the crowd  in terror
Instinctively, Shep (still clutching his side) and Nikki each put a restraining hand on Francis' arm
Francis lowers the rifle, staring in horror and amazement at what he's just done
' Francis
Cary rushes over and pulls the rifle out of Francis' hands
Francis
Francis snaps out of his trance as Cary hurriedly returns the rifle to the gallery
Shep and Nikki watch, stunned, as Francis immediately moves to Cary and shakes his hand
Goodbye, Cary
Francis turns to Shep and Nikki for equally heartfelt handshakes, an odd look on his face
Shep
Nikki
They realize he is saying a final goodbye
The crowd presses in as Francis glances back at Frink before turning and hurrying off
As a huge crowd rushes in the direction of the shooting gallery, Francis threads his way through it in the opposite direction and, with only the briefest glance backward, rounds a corner to disappear behind a building
Cary stares at Frink's body as the gathering crowd streams into view, then quickly starts to lead a shaken Shep and Nikki away from the shooting gallery
We've got to get out of here
Come on, Shep
Come on
They slip through the thick fringe of excited people fast gathering in front of the shooting gallery and hurry off in the same direction as Francis who is now: on a dark, deserted street
Distant crowd  and carnival  drifts in
Under the light of a street lamp on the edge of the carnival, Francis strolls casually into view and swings a leg over a slackly hung boundary rope, pausing to glance backward
He sees
Cary, Shep and Nikki as they round the corner and pause, a little breathless, to lean against a wall
Shep, his fist still at his side, slumps weakly as Cary and Nikki stare at
Francis who briefly makes eye contact and then, without a word, turns, steps over the rope and, pulling his jacket collar up around his neck, walks off, instantly swallowed up by the darkness
Cary and Nikki stare after him, astonished
That's the last of Francis, 'm afraid
We'll never see him again
Did you notice his eyes
That's the first time  ever saw Francis really happy
What'll happen to him, do you suppose
Don't worry about, Francis
He'll take care of himself
Let's get out of here
Let's walk
Shep leans weakly against the wall, his eyes glassy
No
Don't want to walk
Let's take a cab
Cary quickly moves to a signal a cab parked nearby
Nikki rests a sympathetic hand on Shep
- As the cab jolts down an uneven street and drives slowly through the crowded carnival, the  continues
Cary and Shep sit on either side of Nikki
Cary is as edgy as Shep is subdued
Did you see the way Francis poured lead into that fellow
Fast work
Fast
Chain lightning
Nice shooting
Those slugs went right past my ear
If 'd've moved an inch,  would've caught one of them myself
"Sudden Death," all right
Nikki takes out a cigarette
What's the matter with you, Shep
've never known you so quiet before
That's right
am kind of quiet
(holds her unlit cigarette) Not smoking
No
Your lighter working
Good ol', Nikki -- never has any matches
No
As Shep puts his hand in his inside jacket pocket to pull out his cigarette lighter, a strange look crosses his face
Sure you want a light
That's what  want, a light
Shep pulls out the lighter and flicks it on -- revealing bloodstains on his white shirt
Nikki stares down at the blood in horror
Shep
Shep
Nikki jumps up and moves away from Shep, into a seat opposite
What is it
Shep's hurt
Cary turns to Shep, who slumps back weakly against his seat with a strange look of release and satisfaction on his face
It's a forgery
Cary examines Shep, reaching in to feel his bloody wound
Do something for him, Cary
Oh, Shepard
He's been shot
What can we do, Cary
What can we do
Shep, why didn't you say you were hurt
Good old Cary
Sweet Nikki
You may not believe it but this is the best thing that ever happened to me
Oh, Shep, Shep, don't say that
You'll be all right
We'll get you to a hospital
Shep puts a hand on Cary's arm as the taxi continues to jolt along down the street
No, no, Cary
Don't rush me anywheres
Let's sit here for a while
The-- Hurts, the jolting
Urgently, Cary reaches over and bangs on the glass between themselves and the cab driver
Stop
Stop
In front of the carnival's slowly revolving carousel, the cab rolls to a stop
The carousel  drifts in
Shep hardly moves -- head back, blank eyes staring, voice dreamy and weak
Cary puts his face close to Shep's, listening intently
That's better
You know, Cary,  feel - just like we're falling -- long time ago
Do you remember
Spinning spinning
spinning
Only you brought me down safe
Oh, Cary
Good old Cary
(sighs) Best flyer in the service
Nikki, seated opposite, is distraught
Oh, Shepard, Shepard, darling
(reassuring) We're gonna make a safe landing again, Shep
Not this time, Cary
Ol' Shep's gonna crash
(beat) Say, but we're spinning fast
Level off
Cary, level off
Shep's head slumps down
His face presses against Cary's shoulder
' Oh, Shepard, Shepard, darling
Cary can't look at him
Eyes wide, Cary slowly presses his cheek to Shep's
Shep
- Shep
- Shep
Cary looks as if he is on the verge of tears
And yet he cannot bring himself to cry
down a railroad track
- Nikki cranks her portable phonograph, turns it on and puts the needle to the record -- Toselli's "Serenade," that strange, sad composition that haunted Europe at the close of the Great War
As the bittersweet romantic music plays, she listens for a moment
Then she turns and sidles over to sit next to Cary who is seated by the window, scribbling something on a piece of paper beside a small lamp
What are you writing, Cary
letter
letter to Shep's mother
Mind if  read it
Certainly not
Nikki reads the letter silently
long pause
Why, Cary
Cary, that's the most beautiful letter 've ever read
Nikki turns away and begins to cry, quietly
Please forgive me for crying, Cary
can't help it
You don't mind if cry just a minute, do you
No, Nikki
Cary puts aside the letter
Can't you cry, Cary
No
But you have cried sometime in your life, haven't you
Long, long time ago
Before the war
And you can't cry now
Not even for Shep
Shep Lambert spent his life in the war
He had nothing more to give
He had died once
And he was ready to die again
This time he was played out with music
That was the way he wanted it
And Bill Talbot was a big success in the hospital in his new blue shorts
Maybe he'll tackle the angel Gabriel and - be a big success again
And Francis
Maybe Francis will forget to wind his chiming watch one day and go on sleeping
Till the end
It doesn't matter now
Without them, nothing matters
We only had each other
Comradeship was all we had left
And now that's gone, too
And you, Cary
You
You're alone now
That's right
'm alone now
don't want you to be alone, Cary
Let me stay with you
Let me be with you
He takes her hand, looks at her affectionately
Why, Nikki
You're sweet
He kisses her hand
strange, apprehensive look crosses her face as she turns her hand over in his hands and opens it -- to reveal a heart-shaped stone
Cary looks at her in surprise
Why, Nikki, you kept it
You didn't forget
She lowers her eyes for a moment, then looks at him
No harm can come to our true love
(amused, skeptical) No harm can come to our true love
(genuinely) Oh, Nikki, you've become very dear to me
want to help you
Can't do something for you, too
What do you want
What can  get you
Well, 've always wanted a pair of Spanish earrings
He gives her an uncomprehending look but then breaks into a smile as she buries her head lovingly in his shoulder
He kisses her hand again
in a dark, bleak landscape as it chugs away down the track
