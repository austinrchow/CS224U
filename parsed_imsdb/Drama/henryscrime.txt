' Written by Sacha Gervasi - sits inside his glass box on an empty stretch of interstate
This is
He looks out at the horizon
It's starting to get light out
There's snow on the ground
He's neither asleep nor awake
- '   unscrew a , pour coffee into a Styrofoam cup
There are only a few drops left
Approaches
Henry straightens, slides open his window
But the  veers over to the automated -
Henry closes the window, watches the car disappear
He downs the last of his coffee, looks back out at the horizon again
It's cloudy out there
flips to 6:00
- Henry packs up his thermos, puts on his coat and steps out into the icy morning
He walks toward his truck
The traffic is beginning to build
- Henry's old  - drives past the enormous, abandoned
- The pick-up turns down toward a neighborhood of modest salt-box houses
'  - Henry's truck rolls into his driveway
2
'  - Henry enters
Hangs up his down jacket on a row of hooks
It's clean and ordinary in here
His wife, , is in the kitchen
She's wearing a uniform
Henry notices the dining room table set for one for breakfast
Eggs, bacon, sausage
He's a little surprised
Debbie appears
Lays down the toast
Smells good
Sit down
He sits
She smiles
Starts buttering the toast
Wow
Thanks
He digs in
How was your night
Good
How was yours
She's still buttering the toast
Carefully
Good
She sets it down
This is great
She sits down next to him
Watches him eat
(') Your shift's at eight thirty
She nods
(') You not eating
already did
He takes another bite
You okay

Pause
Are you coming with me to Cindy and Bill's on Saturday
Sure
What time
Pause
For the baby shower
Right
She just stares at him
Well,  don't want to go to Cindy and Bill's
What
mean  want Cindy and Bill to come here
Cindy and Bill are welcome here anytime
Pause
Henry
Isn't it time
isn't it time for us
Henry stops eating
You're talking about kids
Of course  am
Okay
'Okay' you want kids
Pause
love kids
He looks down, resumes eating

Henry
He looks up again
(') Do you still love me
He's still as a stone
Of course  do
She looks at him
Because  know you did once
very long pause
Henry doesn't do anything now
She's crestfallen
(') What happened, Henry
He just sits
Henry gets up, heads to the door
Debbie watches him go
'  - Outside on the step there are   in One of them is puking
Behind them  more sit in the back of the car
Henry recognizes the smiling, pock-marked face of Two parts charm, one part menace
His puking friend is
Henry Torne
Eddie Vibes
So how you doin', man
'm okay
What's going on
Listen,  got a man down here
5
Eddie glances up and down the street
(') Mind if we come in for a second
'  - Eddie and Henry watch while Debbie attends to the sick , bits of puke still clinging to his softball uniform
She touches his forehead
He's hot
He starts to retch
(holding it in) 'm sorry
You better come with me
Eddie glances at Henry as Debbie leads him expertly toward the bathroom
Goddamn sausage at Pinwheels
Yeah
So we're in a little bind, Henry
Got league playoffs in a half-hour and Joe's our first baseman
And he's not exactly game-ready as you can see
Yeah
Eddie stares at him
Smiles
So, what do you say
What do  say what
You feel like playing a little ball
Filling in for Joe
It's November
6
Yeah
They keep the field in perfect shape
Oh
Beat
So what do you say
Henry looks around the room
For a moment he watches Debbie with Joe in the bathroom, the door half open
She's tending to him, caring for him
Debbie looks up
Sees Henry staring at her
(') Henry
- Henry drives
He wears Joe's too small softball uniform
Eddie rides shotgun, the other two in the back
They grimly stare out the windows
Appreciate you driving, man
So where's this game
Near Kaisertown
Like fifteen minutes
: - The car turns a corner on to Main Street
Pull up right over here
We gotta grab some beer money at that
The car pulls up to a row of stores including the Eddie pats Henry's shoulder
(') Just hang tight
We'll be right back
Eddie and the guys get out
Henry notes this is strange
7
After a moment Henry realizes something stinks
He sniffs his sleeve
In the rearview, Henry doesn't notice Eddie and the two guys slipping on
' rolls up the security gates of his store and enters
He says good morning to all the animals
It's a strange one man show
-- Henry startles, looks back to where the sound's coming : Fly out of the bank on the corner and scatter in various directions
They're all wearing softball uniforms chases them
, confused
second bank guard  (50s, African-American) is crossing the street toward the bank with two coffees
He sees what's going on, drops the coffees, and pulls his gun : (
) You
Henry turns forward again
Is pointing at him through the windshield
(') Freeze
Henry slowly raises his hands off the wheel
Frank sucks his teeth, his gun trained on Henry as the distant sound of   grows louder
Holding on Henry's stunned expression
,   - Henry sits at a small table as a , whose face we never see, paces back and forth
Henry, we know this wasn't your deal
8
Henry just listens
(') All you have to do is give me those names
And you can go home
It's that simple
Henry's still silent
(') Come on
Why are you sticking up for these people
They're not your friends
You've got a wife
You've got a job
don't you care
() All you have to do is say something
Henry looks up at him, making eye contact for the first time
(
) in light of the fact that this is a first offence
- Henry stands in a suit, flanked by his state-appointed Debbie sits in the gallery
stares at Henry
the court sentences Henry Torne to four years in prison for the crime of Felony 1st Degree Armed Robbery
The gavel goes down
Henry blinks
He looks at his lawyer who is pleased with the sentence
He pats Henry, well done
Henry looks back at Debbie
She's just staring at him
is
- Henry, wearing a prison jumpsuit, watches as the guard locks the door in front of him
(
) So
What're you in for

Henry turns
Huh
said what are you in for
beat
Bank robbery
(60s) pulls up his pants, flushes the
Good
Clean
Simple
like it
Henry just watches
But  didn't do it
Max smiles
Goes to the sink
Washes his hands
Ah
Mistaken identity
perennial favorite
Identities are just constructs, anyway
They're mistaken all the time
He dries his hands
Presents one of them to Henry
(') 'm Max
Henry
Go on
Make yourself at home
Henry sits down on his bed
So
what are you in for
Life
beat
It's starting to hit Henry
(') Don't worry, you'll get used to it
10
- All the cell doors  open
Henry startles awake
Max is already dressed
Hurry up
We gotta go
Henry's disoriented
(') Breakfast
, seeing Henry still in his bunk, bangs his baton against the bars of the cell
- Max and Henry move along a line of convicts waiting for their food
`Monday is whole wheat bun-day
' Henry's lost in thought
(') What are you thinking about
Nothing
You're thinking something
Let me guess
You're thinking, `How did  get here
' Henry puts out his tray
(') How do you think any of us got here
'm not sure
'll tell you how
Because we committed crimes
But we committed to the wrong thing
You see that was our mistake
We didn't fulfill our potential, we got angry and we took it out on other people
bald,  - walks right past them to a table
(') See him
11
Henry nods
(') Hector
He wanted to be a doctor
He could've been, but he chose not to fulfil his potential, he chose not to commit to his dream
And now look at him
() Bad choices, see
Henry does
(') By the way,  recommend the potatoes
- Max and Henry sit down at one of the long tables
That's the real crime, Henry
Not committing to your dream
They begin to eat
(') So what's yours
My what
Your dream
Not sure  ever had one
Never had a dream
What kind of a life is that
don't know
pretty good one
Henry, you're in jail
Henry thinks about that
Puts a piece of potato in his mouth
- Max and Henry walk through the crowded prison yard
But here's the good news
We got all this time to do
And time is a medium of exchange
You can buy things with it
() 12
(') Knowledge
Self respect
Forgiveness
And in your case, you can figure out what your dream is
Max takes his arm : (') Your dream is your truth is your destiny
Henry looks at him
told you
'm here by mistake
Max shoots a look back at him
There are no mistakes
Max suddenly glimpses some activity over Henry's shoulder
What
Several convicts are making their way towards them
He pulls Henry close, his tone suddenly intense : But you're going to have to fight for that dream, Henry
am
You're at a crossroads now
There are going to be tests
What tests
Henry's punched in the side of the head
The inmates grab him, throw him to the ground next to Max
This is your moment
Whatever you do now defines you
Go get em
Henry gets up :  the inmates, arms swinging, taking several down
He gives it everything he's got
They pile into him, pummeling him
Henry just keeps fighting
but it's hopeless
rush in
Max watches
13
'  - Henry lies on his bunk, his face battered and bruised
You did good, Henry
don't feel good
You're doing better than you feel
Henry touches his swollen eye
It stings
(') Go to sleep, Henry
() Sleep is for the blessed
- One by one we see lights blinking off across the vast string of cells
: - Henry's wife Debbie sits at one of the metal visiting tables
She's dressed up
She's really made an effort
door opens, Henry appears
He looks different
Some time has passed
He smiles, walks over
Then sits
Hi
Hi
You look beautiful
Thank you
How are you doing
'm okay
How about you
'm good
beat
(') Listen, Henry
have something  need to talk to you about
14
Okay
fell in love
Henry takes that in
Oh
Pause
just
mean it just happened
Pause
Okay
Wow
'm sorry, Henry
It's alright
You're not mad
He thinks
No
He looks at her
(') want you to be happy
You too, Henry
No one moves
- Henry sits on a bench alone, processing what just happened
He looks up at the sky
Gray and empty
Max arrives, sits down next to Henry, carefully puts a hand around his shoulder
ever tell you  was married
Henry turns to him
15
(') mean nearly
had a lovely correspondence going with Jocelyn Steinberg in Utica
Problem was when she finally came on visitor's day she said was too short
Henry thinks
Books and covers
Right
Books and covers
: '  - There's music on a radio
Pull back to reveal Henry sitting on his bunk
He's grown a beard
Their cell has temporarily been converted into a makeshift
of various races wait to get their hair cut by Max the Barber
Max holds up a mirror to his customer,
Clean as a whistle
(checking himself out) Max,  think you missed your calling
Thank you
() Who do we got next, Henry
Henry checks the schedule by his side, calls out a name
Hector
You're up
Standing just outside,   watches the make-shift barbershop carefully
Hector takes his seat
Max wraps a sheet around his neck
Hey, Max
When are you up for parole
16
October
Show us what you did for the board last time
'm working
The other  egg him on
Show us
Leave me alone
Come on
Show us
Max finally puts his clippers down
All right, so 'm sitting there, and the head of the board asks me what 'm going to do if they let me out this time
And, so
Max's face starts to shudder
his shoulders jerking back a little bit
(') get this twitch
and then  give him my answer: "'m gonna break in your house, set your dog on fire, eat all your food, go on a naked rampage through your garden, dance in the streets of your l'il hometown like a crazed harpee, hurl myself headlong flaming through the ethereal sky like God's blackest angel and explode like a goddamn heavenly fireball
Eyes ablaze and face beetroot red and twitching like a mad man
(') Oh, yeah
You don't want
You don't want
Not out
The inmates look slightly scared
Max casually picks up his clippers and smiles : (') Believe me, 'm not going anywhere
They crack up
beat
17
Hey, White Shadow
When's your review coming up
Next month
You gonna do the twitch like your cellie
Nope
What, you don't like it around here
Everyone knows Henry's innocent
Laughter
( ) The board don't like it when you deny the crime
didn't do the crime
Hey, but you got the time
so you may as well have done it
Everyone laughs
like it
`You got the time, so you may as well have done the crime
' Everyone laughs again
(') Now that's funny, Henry
Yeah, you're right
Henry ponders
- shower
Alot of noise and steam
Henry and Max at the end of a row
You know you never did tell me what your dream was, Max
18
'm living it
Really
Sure
It's easier to live in here
You don't have to do anything
You just show up
In fact they even do that for you
'm living the life
This place is horrible, Max
Max thinks, lathering his hair
So why didn't you just say something
When
Back then
When you had the chance
When you were still innocent
thought maybe this was my way out
And was it
Yeah
See
There are no mistakes
'  - It's early morning
Henry's clean shaven, dressed in street clothes
He packs the last of his things into a sports bag, zips it up
Looks over at Max whose eyes are closed
Max looks vulnerable, like a child, the coverlet pulled right up to his neck
You got everything, kid
Yeah
Henry, silent for a moment
19
(') Maybe you should think about getting out of here sometime
'll buy you a cup of coffee on the outside
The only thing 've ever missed in twenty three years is a hot bath
And that ain't worth walking out of here for
The cell door slides open
(
) Torne
Let's go
Henry starts to leave
Don't forget
Your dream is your myth is your truth
Pause
thought it was my dream is my truth is my destiny
Just testing
Henry continues
stops at the door
'm going to miss you
Yeah, well
hope  never see you again
Henry smiles
'm still gonna miss you
Get out of here, Henry
- It's cloudy
Henry walks through the front  of the prison
He takes a long deep breath of free air
It's cold
We see his exhale
He starts to walk
20
- Henry sits in the back of the bus, the New York countryside streaking past him in a blur
- Henry turns onto his old street
'  - Henry walks up to his doorway
He hesitates before ringing the bell
beat
The door opens
It's -- The guy who got sick several years before
He's wearing a suit and tie now
Henry
How you doing
Hey
( ) Debbie
Henry's here
( ) Come on in
Make yourself at home
Thanks
'   - Henry enters
His old house looks more or less the same
Joe heads over to small display of   in the living room
Don't mind me
'm just getting set up for my meeting
You want a beer
Sure
( ) Honey, do mind getting Henry a beer
21
As Joe clips several   onto an easel -- they look like they were done by a kid -- Debbie appears with a Bud Lite
She hands it to Henry
She smiles
Hi
Hi
It's not so awkward
- Debbie leads Henry to a   and a  with Henry's name on it
think that's everything you wanted
Thanks
beat
They just stand there for a moment
(') Are you happy
am, Henry
'm glad
He means it
Henry picks up the box, shoulders the bag
So what are you going to do now
don't know yet
Joe enters
Honey, they're starting to arrive
Joe grabs a   featuring kitchen products
( ) We're having a meeting
It's his new business
22
Hey, maybe you'd be interested, Henry
You could become a distributor for Jin Chi
They all head out of the garage
(') It's Korean kitchenware
The future of food storage
Plus, if you recruit distributors, you get paid even more
Passing through the living room arriving  notice Henry walking out carrying his box
You mean like a pyramid scheme
No
God, no
It's a multi-layered marketing paradigm
(' ) Anyway, why don't you give it some thought
Henry nods, starts to head out
(') Henry
Yeah
Listen,  just wanted to thank you
For not giving up my name
beat
don't know your name
Sure you do
It's Joe

Right
You're welcome Joe

Inside, a page of senior photos
He finds his own picture smiling at the thresh-hold of adulthood
Underneath his name it reads : " " He studies the image a moment, flips to the inner cover, graffitied with hand-written messages from classmates including : "Henry don't be such a fag, Eddie Vibes" Henry puts the yearbook back in the box
Next to it are a pile of photographs spread out

An ad for the local Buffalo lottery, a in a sequinned dress speaks to the camera
( ) Take a chance on life, take a chance on Buffalotto
Henry closes the lid of the box, regards it
,  - Henry sits at a desk
He's handed a cup of coffee by his -- whose face we never actually see
(
) (re: the coffee) Is it okay
Henry takes a sip
Good
Thank you
(
) So what do you think
About what
(
) About building your life from the ground up
Sure
Sounds good
- grass field
It's raining
Henry steps into frame with a
Behind him an in a cap pushes a wheelbarrow
- From a low-angle we watch as Henry digs
He's a few feet down
The wheelbarrowman still watches silently
25
- Henry lies on his bed, staring up at the ceiling
His mind turns
He's starting to think
the sound of the `BuffaLotto' jingle on the
- It's snowing
The Wheelbarrowman watches silently as Henry digs another small ditch
- Henry sits in the back row
We watch him as he eats popcorn
The movie flashes across his face
There are guns involved
- cloudy spring day
Henry climbs out of the ditch
Throws down his shovel and shakes the wheelbarrowman's hand
He walks away past
He notices a flower poking through the dirt
- The female   sets down a cup of coffee
Henry drinks
We still don't see her face
Thanks
She sits down at her desk
Seems like yesterday you walked through that door
It does
Henry, You've done your time
You are now a free free man
() How does it feel
Henry takes a breath
Good
26
She signs a document and hands it to him
So, What's next
Henry doesn't answer
The  of boots, move in on ' , staring, as we : '   march along the street with purpose
We follow them
After a while, the boots stop
- looks up : we travel around him, see what he sees : Directly across the street
Holding on Henry as he contemplates the place
Henry takes a deep breath
Focuses in
There's something happening, he's not sure what it is
an idea perhaps, an instinct that somehow with each passing moment becomes more like a knowing
moment of revelation
He starts across the street toward the bank, moving now, heading right toward the front door, transfixed, as the out and he begins to smile -- car  Henry in the side
He's knocked down
(30s) Rushes out of the car
What are you doing
What the fuck are you doing
Are you okay
(into cell phone) Stan

No, he looks okay

She hangs up
(') You idiot, you weren't even looking where you were going
Are you okay
Henry's a little delirious

He grabs his thigh
Winces with pain
Tries to get up
No
Stay on the ground
The bank Guard  rushes over
Is he alright
Don't get up

No, don't
(Starts to stand) think 'm okay
( ) You

Cars are honking now as Henry limps his way over to the sidewalk
28
(') What are you doing
Get back on the ground
Park your car

She jumps back in her car and pulls it over to the side
Frank comes over to Henry, takes his arm

Henry regards this with some interest, tries the theatre door
This one's open
- Henry enters the lobby
The light is low
There's something almost magical about this place
Henry hears  drifting in from the main theatre as he continues to walk, heading toward the sounds
(
) (As Madame Ranevsky) Is it really me sitting here

- Henry enters the back of the theatre
sees the girl on : 35
The girl who hit him with her car

An action

: Two
They stand right there at the bar
Silence
Henry notices the play poster on the wall over her shoulder
Looks at it
Then back at her
Comparing her photo to the live person
(') What
She turns to see what he's looking at
beat
(') So what do you think
Doesn't look like you
No,  meant the poster
Oh
It's funny
Actors on a tree is funny
Yeah
She smiles
Pierre puts the coffees down on the bar
39
That's the director's joke
She starts dropping cubes of sugar in her cup
(') He's making a comment on the American culture
Actors faces as falling fruit
Birth, death, the consumption of the
Henry's interested
(') To him, the American dream has become the world's nightmare
"You are the country of apocalypse
" ( ) That's what he told us on the first day of rehearsal, anyway
Oh
The irony is, he loves the American dream
mean that's why he's here, right
() But  know for a fact he hates himself for loving it
It's always an inside job, isn't it
Yeah
guess
Pause
But the truth is  wasn't listening was playing it safe
() He was right
The jerk
About that, anyway
She drinks her coffee
(') You know the Cherry Orchard was Chekhov's last play
He was dying when he wrote it
She thinks
He listens
(') It's perfect
Why
40
(' It's my last play too
Here in Buffalo
You're leaving
She downs the last of her coffee
Right after we're done
() 'm glad you came by
Thanks for not suing me
'll see ya
She leaves
He watches her through the glass as she walks across the street
right past the bank on her way back to the theatre
- 's cell door opens
He walks, happy and confident this morning
( ) Hey Barber, tomorrow lunch, right
Right
Give `em hell
always do, Felipe
As Max reaches the end of the walkway, an   opens the next steel door for him
Morning, Max
Here we are again
How's your grandson
Just started first grade
That's great
The socialization begins
The Guard smiles as he leads him toward the at the end of another long corridor
They stop at the door
41
How many more of these you think you got in you, Max
Pause
As many as it takes
The Guard shakes his head, opens the door for him
,  - is reading Max's file as he enters
Good afternoon, Mr
Saltzman
Take a seat
The  gestures to the chair
The other members of the Board stare at Max
The head Parole officer leafs through page after page of denied applications
Max watches the pages turning, the years of his life going by, taking it in
(') Mr
Saltzman
Could you please tell the board why you believe we should grant you parole
They all wait for Max's answer
He's silent
(') ( ) Come on, Mr
Saltzman, what have you got for us this time
Closer on Max
He looks like he might start to twitch at any moment
(') (o
s
) Mr
Saltzman
Well
- The gigantic   clank open
Max emerges, a tiny figure against the imposing facade
He's holding a small black valise
Looks like it was made in the 40s
42
Max looks a little less sure of himself
Appears
Smiling
knew you could do it
Max looks around nervously
Where's the car
don't have a car
You don't have a car
What's wrong with you
You came to pick me up without a car
That's not picking a person up
Yes, it is
'm here
'm picking you up
don't know about this
Maybe this is a mistake
Max turns
walks back towards the gates
Starts to on them
(') Dave
Carl
Max, it's okay
You're free
Open up
No response
Henry approaches
Takes Max's bag
Come on, Max
don't like this
Take it easy
There's nothing to be frightened of
promise
You're okay
The bus station's just a short walk
Max starts to hyperventilate : 43
can't breathe
-- can't breathe
Henry hesitates a moment, puts an arm around him
You're going to be alright
(nearly on his knees) 'm going to die right here
told you
Come on, Max, we're going to miss that bus
Henry helps Max back up again
- rumbles through the countryside
- Henry and Max sit up front right next to the driver
Max has his eyes closed
He still looks woozy
You hungry
He opens his bag and pulls out a sandwich
Offers it to him
Max doesn't say anything
(') It's pastrami
On rye
beat
Max opens one eye
'  - Henry opens the door for Max
They enter
Here we are
Henry indicates the tiny bed in the corner of the living room
There are some second hand books on the bedside table like `Future Shock' by Alvin Toffler and Dostoyevsky
(') That one's yours
44
Max goes over, looks at the books
Sits down on the bed
Thanks
Anything else you need
beat
Yeah
'  - Max reclines in the steaming , luxuriating in the warm water
He closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and relaxes
After a moment he notices a fancy-looking bottle on the side
(reads the label) Ah
The land of milk and honey
Pours it into his bath
- As they cross a street, Max notices a coffee shop on the other side
What is this obsession with coffee, Henry
When did that happen
'm not sure, Max
But it seems to give people a lot of purpose
They walk into the Cafe Orpheum
,  -- - Henry looked at earlier when he was pissing
Max is staring at the thing now too
Oh my God
Are you kidding
This was eighty years ago
It's ridiculous
Oh my God
That tunnel's probably not even there anymore
Are you dreaming, Henry
45
It's a start
start
This was your plan
An old cartoon in a pissoir
It's an article
Whatever, Henry
Why don't we just go in with guns and do it the old-fashioned way
No
No guns
What
Someone could get hurt
Pause
That's sweet, kid
(the tunnel photo) Maybe it's still there, Max
beat
() Uh-huh
Maybe it is
Max looks at him
Right
Okay
Yes
First things first
Why don't we go take a look at this bank of yours
() At least we know that's still there
Henry looks at him
- Max and Henry walk in to the grand banking hall
46
Money is a mistress with a hard heart
observes Max and Henry
Henry glances over at him too
Doesn't react
Frank watches them as they walk toward the
(') 'd like to speak to your manager please
'm interested in opening an account
: - : ` , Assistant Manager'
(
) And which kind of account would you like to open
Sitting in front of his desk
What kind do you have
Savings
Interest only
Commercial -- () You know my uncle put all his money in that vault when  was a kid, after we came from Europe, before the war
the Brownshirts
He said that vault will be there for three hundred years
We hope he's right
He was never wrong
How long's it been there already Mr
Tuttle
Since 1891
And in the very same spot, correct
That's right
On the very same spot
47
( ) See, my boy
History
It's all about history
Now
As  was saying
We have savings
Interest only
Commercial -- () You'll have to give us some time to think about which one
Max gets up
(') Thank you
You've been very helpful
() No
Thank you
Henry and Max walk out past Frank
He watches them leave
Have a nice day, gentlemen
,    - stand in the alley
Henry touches the back of the bank wall
The vault is here
He walks across the alley
(') The tunnel runs under here
He follows it toward the back door of the theatre
(') And ends up somewhere in there
He turns to Max
It's virtually robbing itself
Henry laughs
the back of his head as it open
Jesus
goddamn
Goddamn Czech Chekhov shit
48
She storms out, punches the air, screams : (') Suddenly notices Max and Henry standing there
(rubbing his head) Hi
Jesus
Henry
She looks at Max
Julie, Max
Max, Julie
Hiya
What are you doing here
Oh, we were, you know -- was just showing Henry the place  used to perform
Henry shoots Max a look
Oh
What
The door opens
, the Stage Manager, pokes his head out
That's lunch, Julie
Thank God
Chekov's tough stuff
It takes a steel stomach
You know Chekhov
Of course
Apart from Gorbachev he's my favorite Russian
She laughs
Max approaches her
49
(') Would you mind if we took a look around
It's been over thirty years since 've been inside
She considers the request
Sure
She gestures them inside
(') Sure
Yeah
Come on in
Thank you
As Henry passes : How you doing
Great
'm in hell
- Max walks to centre stage front like he's been there before
He looks out at the auditorium, a little emotional all of a sudden
Home again
So what productions were you in
Oh
Shakespeare, Ibsen, Mahoney, the greats
( ) And the not-so-greats
Simon arrives
( ) Mary wants to fit your wig at four
Darek says to stay hungry
Fuck him
Got it
Max and Henry exchange a glance
50
Would it be a tremendous imposition to have a little tour for old time's sake
He used to perform here
don't see why not
We're on a break
That okay, Henry
Sure
Go ahead
Julie and Henry watch them go
Is that your dad
No
He's a friend
He seems like your dad
Henry walks out onto the stage where Max was standing, getting the feel of it
It's peaceful out here
Beat
(') Is it fun
What
Pretending to be other people
She thinks
It's not really like that
don't pretend to be someone else
find some part of me, and reveal it in a new way
just inside of a character
So, in a way, you're still playing `you'
Yes
Exactly
In a way
51
So what part of `you' are you playing now
That's the question you always have to ask yourself
,  - Max follows Simon through a tight hallway of They pass  eating lunch or playing cards
Nothing very glamorous
Ah, the inner sanctum
The magic before the magic
remember it like it was yesterday
They enter the Green Room where  is holding court
- People often make the mistake in Chekhov of going down
but you must always always go up
Other  look at him with blank faces
Max gestures Simon closer
With a conspiratorial whisper - Simon, did you know there used to be a speakeasy down here during prohibition days
Yes
And they hid the booze in the bank
know
And there was a tunnel too
know
() forget
Where was it
52
- Henry examines the fake bookshelves on the drawing room set
Julie sits in an armchair eating the sandwich she's pulled out of her bag
She watches him a moment
So what's your story, Henry
My story
mean, like
what do you do
Henry crosses the stage, goes to sit in the chair opposite her
'm figuring that out
Does that mean you don't have a job
beat
just got out of jail
She wasn't expecting that
Jail
Sounds worse than it is
Really
Jail sounds bad
() Why were you in there
She takes a big bite of her sandwich
(') Are you a murderer or something
No
Do  look like one
She studies him
No
53
What do  look like
She studies him some more
don't know
criminal
He laughs
do
She laughs
Then stops
Dead serious : Yeah
- taped paper sign on the door reads ` please knock'
Simon opens it for Max, shows him inside
We got to be quick
Arnold doesn't like people in his dressing room
- costume on hangers
wig and beard in front of the mirror
Simon walks into the room
Places his hand on the far wall
() It was right here
Max comes up
Feels it now too
Booze, broads and lucre
The good old days
like it
They filled it in, in 1931 when they built the theatre
Max pads the wall like it's a good old friend, testing it
searching
(') Times have changed
54
All good things must come to
(he hits a hollow spot) an end
Max stops
Turns to Simon, and with a broad smile : (') Do you need volunteers
- Henry picks up a marked-up text of the Cherry Orchard that's on one of the chairs
The Cherry Orchard
(leafing through it) So what happens
What's it about
Is it funny
Julie gets up out of her chair
woman returns to her family estate in the Russian countryside and realizes she has no choice but to sell her beloved Cherry Orchard, the magical place of her youth, the only place she ever felt safe
guess it's not funny
She looks at him
It's about being forced to let go of the past and create a new life in order to survive
Max's voice booms : (
) That was great
This place is full of treasures
Max comes right up to them
(') Thank you, Julie
And thank you, Simon
'll see you tomorrow
Tomorrow
Max has very kindly offered to volunteer at the theatre
55
Oh
Henry, let's get out of these people's way
Henry turns to Julie
( ) What are you doing after rehearsal
Why
Do you like Chinese
Yeah
Golden Dragon
It's okay
Eight o'clock
: Sure
They look at each other as  return to the stage
moves towards his place in the front seats
Work
Work
It's time to work Americans
( ) Even you Djula
Max grabs Henry -- Let's go
See you, Julie
Stay out of jail
Henry waves
56
- Max and Henry exit the back stage doors
You were right, Henry
You got a nose like a bloodhound
You found it
Yeah
Right there
In Lophakin's dressing room
Who
Lophakin
We find a way to get into his dressing room and we're right as rain
Henry and Max notice  standing at the corner of the alley having a cigarette
He glares at them as they pass
,  - Henry gets ready for his date
Max keeps talking, sitting on the side of the tub as he draws the bath
can see it, Henry
It's all in front of me
The vault
The bank
The tunnel
The pieces of the puzzle are on the table
All we got to do is put them in the right order
() The only thing is the dirt
where does the dirt from the tunnel go
What about the vault
First things first
'm on the dirt
Okay
How do  look
Like Henry
() We had a good day, Kid
It's good to be back in the soup
() 57
(') (he starts to take off his ) Go have a nice supper
Henry places it between a  and a , linking them together like
a tunnel
-  - Henry waits for Julie
He's all cleaned up
Fresh shirt
Sorry 'm late
'm starving
She sits
Looks at the menu
who's leaving, sees her : Julie
Bruce
The guy glances at Henry
Leaves
(') That guy's a total dick
Hi, Henry
She studies the menu
Hi
How was rehearsal
She puts it down
No answer
feel like duck
- It's the end of the meal
Henry listens
don't just want to be good,  want to be great
And  don't just want to be great in Buffalo
Where then
Don't laugh
() Hollywood
58
He doesn't
guess that's where people go
don't want my legacy to be a Buffalotto commercial
And it's not going to be
Soon as this thing is done 'm out of here
() Before it's too late
Sounds like a plan
The waitress brings over the check and the fortune cookies
hate fortune cookies
'  - Julie sings along to the radio, smoking half a joint from the ashtray
Henry watches her
Julie knows she's being watched
She's enjoying herself
We going anywhere in particular
(hits the joint) Want some
Henry shakes his head no
She turns the radio up
: Walk along a precipice near some railings
They move closer to the
They look out at the flood-lit
Stand there a moment
(') You know there's a whole bunch of bodies down there churning around
Just caught in the current
() They all took the risk and look what happened to them
Same in death as they were in life
Imagine that
You kill yourself and nothing changes
59
They both stare down into the roaring water
(') All those dreams churning around down there
It makes you sick
() got to get out of here
get it
They start to walk
So what did you do before jail, Henry
worked at a toll booth
Which one
Rainbow bridge
No
Yes
had family that used to live on the other side
took that bridge all the time
We must of met a hundred times
He nods
She's probably right
(') Wow
So you were one of the guys in the tollbooth with those weird rubber gloves
Yeah
She laughs
(') What's so funny
You were watching everyone go somewhere and you were going nowhere
That's funny
Yeah
Funny sad, not funny funny
60
worked nights
It gave me time to think
About what
About where  wasn't going
See, that's funny
() What about now
Where you going now
'm working on it
What'd they send you to jail for Henry
For trying to rob the First Buffalo Bank
What
thought  was on my way to a softball game
It was a mistake
Pause
Sounds like it
He looks at her
Decides : But now 'm going to rob it for real
You're going to rob the bank you already went to jail for robbing
Yeah
Ha
There's a tunnel
What tunnel
Runs from the bank to the theatre
61
My theatre
Yeah
Ha
She looks out the falls
(') You're fucking hilarious, Henry
() Thank you
beat
We can't tell what she's thinking
You know what
What
'm hungry
What for
(as the thought occurs) Ice cream
'  -  - Henry leans against the sink watching Julie at the table eating Ice Cream
There's music on in the b
g
They watch one another for a moment
She takes a big spoonful
can't believe 'm sitting here
Neither can
She gets up
want to dance and clap my hands
She moves through into the lounge
Henry follows
62
(') think  must be dreaming
She starts moving around the room, dancing to the music
(') God knows  love my country
love it deeply
She sits down
(') couldn't see out the train window  was crying so much
Henry's not sure what she's talking about
She gestures to her copy of `  ' on the coffee table
(') Page twenty one
Henry opens it
(') couldn't see out the train window  was crying so much
But  must drink my coffee
() Read Lophakin
She points to the right place
Henry, awkwardly : ` have to go to Kharkov on the five o'clock train
Such a bother,  wanted to stay and look at you and talk to you
( ) You're as wonderful as ever
' He stops, looks at her : Read the next line
`Even more beautiful, and dressed like a Parisian
you could blow me down
' Say it like you feel it
Like it's real
Say it to me
Henry takes a beat
This time he makes it his
63
` Even more beautiful, and dressed like a Parisian
you could blow me down
' She laughs like a little girl
You're good
Keep reading
And get up
Walk around
`Your brother says 'm an upstart, a money-grubber
' Yes, you are
You're a bank robber, Henry
He laughs
(the text again) ` don't care a bit
just want you to believe in me like the old days
' (pulling him around the room) Don't stop -- ` just want your wonderful tender eyes to look at me like they did then
' Again
Henry's getting into it
` just want your wonderful tender eyes to look at me like they did then
' She laughs some more
Comes closer
'm glad  ran you over
Henry puts the book down
Me too
They kiss
64
'  -- Henry and Julie asleep in the bed
She opens her eyes
Realizes he's there with her
as if sensing her, he opens his eyes too
They look at one another
() Good morning
Good morning
She climbs on top of him
Henry smiles
(') Good morning
'  - Sun streams in through the window
Tchaikovsky plays on a tiny transistor radio
Max humming to the music, reading `Future Shock' on the toilet
The sound of the front door of the apartment opening -- Henry
(
) Max
(pulling up his boxers) figured it out
Once we're in that dressing room the dirt from the tunnel goes out through the roof
-- (rushing out into the front ) That bank doesn't stand a chance
is standing right there, holding a bag of groceries,  is right next to him
Max goes white
He's in his underwear
(') Ah
Company
Good morning, Max
65
Max is frozen
It's alright
She knows
She does
didn't know the dirt from the tunnel goes out through the roof
She laughs a little
Max looks at Henry like `what the fuck
' We brought breakfast
How do you like your eggs
Henry enters the kitchen
leaving Max and Julie there
It's okay
'm not going to tell anyone
Hold on
Max follows Henry into the kitchen
- Henry unpacks the groceries
You told her
( ) About what we're doing
Yeah
did
It's a crime
You're supposed to keep crimes a secret
It's okay, Max
No
It's not kosher
Pause
How do you like your bacon
66
() Crispy
Max leaves the kitchen for the front room where Julie's waiting, amused by the whole thing
Max just stands there in his underwear a moment, sizing her up
(') Okay
'll get dressed
- They eat
So what were you in prison for, Max
Max slurps his coffee
'm a confidence man
You mean a `con' man
never liked that word
It's only half of what it is
The word confidence comes from the latin
Fides
With Faith
Belief
() That's what 'm about
She considers this
You mean you make people feel good
and then you rip them off
Yes
He glances at Henry
(') But  was always much better at the feeling good part than the ripping off part
() Hence, the prison
Aren't you guys worried about getting caught
67
Not really
For me it's a win-win situation
How
like jail
Three hots and a cot
Julie looks at Henry now
You too, Henry
You like jail
No
like it out here
So why would you take the risk
Is it the money
Henry doesn't answer, starts to collect the plates
(') It must be the money
Henry smiles
(') You are a criminal
greedy little criminal
(washing the plates) `Your brother Leonid says 'm an upstart, a money grubber
() but  don't care a bit'
He turns to her
(') ` just want you to believe in me like the old days
' You remember
What is that
It's Chekhov
Chekhov
68
We read it last night
( ) You really are good
( ) He's a natural
thought you were on a date
We were
Reading Chekhov's a date
Beat
Yeah
She downs her coffee
Stands
got to get to the theatre -- Can you give me a ride there
Why
'm a volunteer
She regards him a moment
You weren't in any of those plays, were you
No
() But can you give me a ride
- Julie as Madame Ranevsky
Her brother  and her daughter  are also on stage
All white
All White
Oh, my Cherry Orchard
After the dark, stormy autumn and the winter frosts you are young again and full of happiness; the heavenly angels have never abandoned you
() 69
(') Oh, if only  could be free of the stone that weighs me down
If only  could forget my past
Watching from the back of the theatre in the semi- darkness
He's transfixed
Max watches too
He wears his volunteer badge
Yes and now the orchard will be sold to pay our debts, which seems impossible
Look
It's mamma walking in the orchard
in a white dress
(laughing with joy) There she is
Where
Momma, don't
and dissolves into one of the Cherry Trees
Henry and Max speak in hushed voices : This is driving me crazy
What
We could be digging right now
We could
If we were in that dressing room
It's rehearsal
There are people everywhere
This is pissing me off
Max leaves
after a moment he stops where he is
freezes
then turns back to Henry
70
What
got an idea
What
You have to be Lophakin
What
If you did we'd be able to get into that tunnel whenever we want
'm not an actor
You're not a bank robber either
And you're doing that
Max
Come on
She said you were a natural
That means you can do it
No, it doesn't
Yes, it does Henry
( ) You  Lophakin
man who came from nothing
man who's not afraid to create a new life
() man who's in love with her
Henry stares at Julie, mid performance, on the stage
(') Your dream is your truth is your destiny
Henry thinks
can't be Lophakin
They have a Lophakin
Max thinks
71
What if they didn't
There has to be another way
Max, frustrated : Kid, You forced me out of jail to help you
And 'm going to goddamn help you
But you got to help me help you
Now need to know
(a fierce stare) do you want this bank or not
On Henry
Yes
want it
(') Then you're gonna be Lophakin
: Walks down the street
It's snowing
He approaches the theatre
,  - Arnold enters, shivering, shaking the snow off his coat
Good morning, everyone
None of the actors pay him much attention
He pours himself a cup of coffee, makes his way toward his dressing room
- Arnold opens the door with his key
- Arnold enters, hangs up his coat
There is a leaning against his make-up mirror
He approaches
Opens it
Starts to read
72
As he absorbs the words he lets out a small gasp
and
falls into his chair
After a moment he puts down the letter and stares at himself in the mirror
You knew this day would come
You deserve this, lubya
He closes his eyes
Bows his head
Starts to weep
- : the veins on the side of his forehead pulsate with rage
Unprofessional shit
Mr
Millodragovich -- () Shit
- Julie stands in the wings
Max joins her
What's happening
Arnold's leaving the production
Oh
Gosh
on the stage
Simon behind them
Darek is right in '  : But  have no choice it's Willie Lohman we're talking about
(brandishing the letter) Ken Waterstone production
--
Ken Waterstone production
The heaven's have opened
You lucky boy
() 73
(') Run, run, to that pandering, populist, piece-of-shit-Waterstone and his spineless productions
You're perfect for it
Good-bye, Darek
() 'm sorry
Arnold marches off the stage with his case
Simone
need a new Lopakhin
Now
( ) 'm dying, Olga
Cigarettes
Cigarettes And
We'll hold auditions this afternoon, Darek
'll get the list -- Darek ingests caffeine and nicotine at an alarming rate : 've seen that shit-list
It's a disaster
What do we do
must think
He moves stage left past Julie
(') Djula
Your orchard cannot be felled before she has a chance to grow
And with that he disappears with Olga out the door
Perfect
Beat
( ) It is Ken Waterstone
She shoots him a look, picks up her stuff and goes
- Julie, on the phone, searches for her keys in the bag as she approaches her car
74
Yes, Stan, yes
know it's bullshit but that's what's happening
( ) don't know, he's `thinking'
She gets in the car
Tries to find a roach in the ashtray
at the passenger window
She looks up
It's
(') What
He gestures, `Can  come in
'
Max gets in
(') Sorry,  can't give you a ride -- You said he was a natural
Stan
Let me call you back
(she hangs up, to Max) What
Henry
Henry what
Henry would be perfect for it
Perfect for what
For Lophakin
It takes a moment till her mind gets a hold of the idea
You mean Henry should play Lophakin
Yes
She laughs
He's not even an actor
Exactly
He'd be playing himself
(off her shocked look) Think about it Julie
He is Lophakin
() 75
(') man who came from nothing
man who's not afraid to create a new life and put his past behind him
man who's in love with you
Madame Ranevsky
beat
She does think about it
Why do  feel like the earth is suddenly shifting under my feet
Fact is you need a Lophakin and Lophakin needs a dressing room
() Can you get him in to see Darek
She hesitates
What's going on here, Max
What are you doing
Nothing
She regards him
Suspiciously
You made this happen, didn't you
Sometimes a good guy needs a less good guy to help the good guy be good
He smiles
beat : She  him hard across the cheek
(') Fair enough
They just sit there for a moment
What am  supposed to do now
He just needs a shot
One audition
Let the chips fall where they may
What if it doesn't work
They'll get someone else
She thinks
76
(') Give him a shot
One shot
That's all 'm asking, Julie
She thinks some more
Okay, confidence man
'  - Julie sits, looking at Henry who stands in the middle of the living room of Darek's apartment
Circles
walking around him
an animal tracking its pray
he's chain-smoking
you've never had any training
you've never been in a production
you don't even know the play
read it
think  know the scene
Think
He glances at Julie
Then back at Henry
(') Start
() `Your brother , Leonid Andrevich
' How can you perform Chekhov and not be able to say ---
Now say it
Darek nods, continue : (') Your brother, Leonid  says 'm an upstart, a money grubber -- what
money-grubber
77
Are you
Convince her
Darek pushes Henry closer to Julie
She stands : Your brother, Leonid Andreyevich says 'm an upstart, a money grubber
He can say whatever he likes
don't care a bit -- (into his ear) Henry ignores him and with twice the passion -- just want you to believe in me like in the old days
: Show me, tell me
Darek laughs, circling
Henry takes her hand now
his voice drops
Good God in Heaven
My father was one of your father's serfs, and your grandfather's serf before that
But you, you did so much for me in the old days that 've forgotten all that
His yearning is suddenly palpable
Intense
Tender
(') love you
like a sister
more than a sister
Henry drops to his knees, supplicates
You piece of shit
Yes
Henry just breathes
He's unbreakable
beat
(') Good
78
Henry looks up
Good
Yes
Darek considers him
(') Tomorrow
Be more good
Henry and Julie share a look
He actually did it
'  --  - She drives
Henry rides shotgun
They both look at the road ahead
In silence
After a while
Does this make me an accessory
think so
beat
Things have certainly gotten a lot more interesting since you showed up
You mean since you ran me over
She smiles
'  -- They make love
It's more intense than before
They climax
They lie there, breathless, looking at each other
- She makes tea
Henry sits at the table watching her
So why are you robbing the bank, Henry
He doesn't answer
79
(') It's not just about the money, is it
No
So why are you doing it
It takes a moment for him to answer
used to sit in that toll booth and think about just getting in one of those cars, going wherever they went
Just joining someone else's life
You were asleep at the wheel
Henry smiles
Yeah,  was
() It was easier for me to go to jail than tell my wife the truth
Which was
That  was going along with everything didn't know  could change it
() So now 'm changing it
Robbing the bank is changing it
It already has
She gets the honey out of the cupboard
Pours some in her tea
What was your wife like
Nice
beat
(') Are you sure you're okay with this know it's a lot
She turns to him
80
Not for a girl like me, Henry
- Darek addresses the full cast
Henry by his side
This is Mr
Henry Smith
He will be taking over the role of Lophakin
If you please
He leads a light round of applause
Henry acknowledges : Thanks
Thank you
Looking forward
Top of act three
Twenty minutes
Olga, cigarettes
Henry walks briskly away
Julie watches him
- Henry enters his dressing room, locking the door behind him
Max is already waiting
He turns the music on
They move the   that's against the wall aside
Max spreads a blanket on the floor to catch the falling rubble and holds another against the wall to muffle the sound
Henry pulls a sledgehammer out of a bag : He  the wall  and
- The blanket is pulled aside to reveal    on the other side looking in
Max shines his flashlight : It's dusty
Max climbs through the hole, disappears down the tunnel
Henry follows, counting his steps
81
- Max and Henry, stooped over, make their way down the dank, dark passage
Max's flashlight combs the floor
glint of light now as something
Tracks
Trolley tracks
The beam scours the blackness ahead looking for the end
and there it is
soot-covered  maybe ten feet ahead
They reach it
Henry touches the damp, decrepit brick, turns to Max
There's still twenty feet to go
He turns back to him : (') We're going to need another pair of hands
`'  ,    - It's cold out
Max and Henry walk inside
`'  ,    - giant screen showing the game
Henry and Max arrive at the bar
(0
) No
No
You got to be kidding me
You suck
You
Could you possibly anymore
That's him
That's him
Henry and Max watch as  grabs his head, flops into a chair
Max looks concerned
- Henry and Max sit with the guy --  who's drunk
82
Thanks for meeting us
Sure
Joe is looking worse for wear
How's your pyramid scheme
It wasn't a pyramid scheme
Okay
Joe hits his Schooner Longneck
It all fell apart
() We were banking on that money, Henry
And now all 've got is a garage full of dumb Korean plastic
What's he talking about
Kitchenware
Oh
See what happens when a person tries to go `legit'
() It's killing me
Joe drains his beer
The  arrives with a bucket of steaming wings
So how's Debbie
She's worried, Henry
The baby's due in a couple months
He grabs a wing
Rips off the meat
She's pregnant
Yeah, she's pregnant
83
Henry takes it in
Congratulations
Thanks, Henry
() It's okay if you want to punch me out
Tonight would be a good night
In fact could use it
Come on
This is great news
(off Joe's hopeless look) It's going to be okay
Really
It is
You know how much diapers cost
You know how much it costs to send a kid to college
You want to send your baby to college
Joe keeps going on the wings
He's making a meal of it
Of course not
'm just saying
The kid needs stuff
Stuff that's expensive
Stuff it deserves
() These things are hot
'm on fire
Listen, Joe, maybe we can help
beat
( ) How
We might have a job for you
Max shoots a look at Henry
Joe chugs a glass of water, looking at both of them now
No foolin'
- Henry, Max and Joe stand hunched over at the end of the tunnel
84
There's maybe twenty feet till the bottom of that vault
That's a lot of dirt, Henry
Max studies Joe
So what do you think
think we should get some guns and go get the money through the front door
No guns
People could get hurt
What about fake ones
They're still guns
Listen Joseph, guns are dangerous and we're not doing a simple hold-up
Tellers and tears and chump change
We're doing an old fashioned heist
We're going right into the belly of the beast
() Are you in or are you in
Considering it
He picks up a shovel and  into the wall of dirt
hope we don't get caught
' ,  -- Henry and Julie are in bed
He memorizes his lines
The 's on low
Julie's Buffaloto commercial comes on
Julie snaps it off
hate that commercial
like it
She looks at him
85
So what's your plan
For what
For when it's done
After
(making light of it) Am  going to see your picture in the post office or something
hope not
But have you thought about what happens after
Not really, no
He thinks carefully before he says it : (') don't know
Maybe  could meet you out west
Out west
Yeah
Maybe you could meet me there
( ) When did you think of that
Just now
() So what about it
What about what
Meeting me -- -- 'm not going anywhere, Henry -- You're not
No
86
thought that was your plan
Do the play -- Plans change, Henry
Okay
She gets out of bed
Throws on her robe
(') think  ran out of maple syrup
- We follow Henry as he walks through her apartment and finds Julie in the kitchen, standing at the sink, not moving
Is there a reason you didn't leave before
Because life is fucked
It never works out the way you want it to
Silence
Yeah
Well
Maybe
() But you could still meet me
Right
On the lam
You're dreaming
It was just an idea
Why not -- This isn't going to work out, Henry
She turns to face him
(') Didn't we both know that
On Henry
didn't
did
Silence
87
(') think you should leave
Henry just stands there
stunned
- Henry leaves Julie's apartment
There's snow on the ground
It's freezing out here
He starts to walk
(
) It's going to be incredible
'm talking, Florida
'  - Max hungrily munches his cheerios at the table
Palm trees
Sandy beaches
All you can eat sunshine
Grapefruits as big as your head
Henry sits across from him
Why couldn't  have met her after
Who
Julie
asked her to meet me
After we're done
Oh yeah
What'd she say
She said no
Of course she said no
Why of course
Because life ain't like that
There's always a cost
That's why they call it life
You got to pay somewhere
The piper must be paid to pipe
88
paid already, Max
() don't want to leave her
Max looks at him
About to say something -- at the door
Who's that
'll check
Henry walks to the door
(') Who is it
(
) It's me
Joe
Henry opens it
stands there
He's drunk
And a little sheepish
Now we see why :   is standing right beside him
He walks right on in
(') Sorry, Henry
The same bank
Shit, Henry
Now that's poetry
like it
Who is this guy
Eddie beams at Max
Your new partner
Max looks at Henry : `huh
' What do you mean
'm in
Or you're out
screwed up
Sorry, Max
Joe lies down on the floor
He's drunk as a skunk
(amused by the whole thing) Joe tells me you guys might need a little help with that vault
know the whole story
89
He sits
(') And  don't dig
Dig
() Got any cold ones
Joe doesn't know what he's talking about
He's a drunk
He made a mistake
Get out of that chair
Eddie laughs
Leans back on it
Relax, old man
Henry and  go way back
We've known each other since high school, isn't that right
Yeah
know you
Appreciate you keeping your mouth shut, Henry
One thing  admire in a man is the quality of loyalty
What do you want, Eddie
Nothing
Just the American dream
: At the window
Looking down as  gets into his car
He senses them watching him
Turns around
Gives them the thumbs up
- Max and Henry watch Eddie leave
'm gonna kill him
With a knife
You can't kill him
(slurred, on the floor) Yeah
You can't kill him, Max
He's got the vault -- Shut up, Joe
90
He looks over at Joe on the floor
Thinks about how easy it would be to just kick him in the head
Deb says we can't have sex till the kid's born
Says the kid'll know about it
Go home
Please
Before it's too late
: - Henry in period costume
He has a beard
He watches from the stalls as they run a dress rehearsal
'm sorry to be blunt, but, for God's sake, the man has robbed you
(stopping her ears) No
No
No
Don't say that
He's a scoundrel: everybody knows it but you
He's a petty scoundrel, a user
, feeling like the accused
From the stage Julie sees him
You are twenty six or twenty seven, and you're still in the lower grades
Who cares
She locks eyes with Henry now : You ought to be grown up by now
At your age, you ought to understand about love -- Where are you, Djula
Where
(with double the fire) You ought to love someone yourself
You ought to have an affair
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Good Djula
Scene
() Carlotta and the girls
() 91
(') ( ) Let's run the magic scene
Julie walks off the stage
She knows Henry is waiting for her
What happened last night
came to my senses
() And you should too
She walks on
He follows
We should talk about it
She turns
don't want to, Henry
- Henry arrives to find Max attaching one of the bags of dirt to a pulley
Above them, Joe begins to hoist it up through the open skylight
Henry looks up
(tugging the pulley) Three feet of it so far today
We'll make it
Henry goes to the open doors of the Armoire
The tunnel is deeper now and all lit up
- Henry, Max and Joe make their way toward Joe's car
What do you think guys
If it's a boy do cut him or not
Well, you know what they say, cleanliness is next to Godliness
What do you say, Henry
Before he can answer : 92
(
) see you guys in the bank
see you guys in the alley next to the bank
They turn
, the bank guard, is standing right there
He's in his street clothes
Now  see you coming out of the theatre behind the bank
Frank sucks his teeth
(') know what you're up to Gentlemen
Henry, Max and Joe look at each other
Frank moves closer
Checks around to make sure no one can hear them
(') And  want in
In on what
Frank snickers
We can't talk here
Let's drive
Max looks at Henry
'  - Joe's driving
Max is in the passenger seat
Henry in the back next to Frank
What's on your mind, Frank
The
Indigenous Currency Retrieval and Exchange
They exchange glances
(') Once a month a truck goes to all our partner banks across the border in Canada, picks up all the currency and brings it back home
They're listening
93
(') 'd say on average eight to twelve million, held in our vault at First Buffalo for just a few hours before it's picked up for redistribution
Now they're paying attention
(') Only a bunch of fools would rob that bank any other time
beat
He leans closer
(') can give you that date
can help with alarms
can be your guy on the inside
Hypothetically say you were right about what we're up to
which you're not
But just say
why would you help us rob your bank
got my reasons
This sounds like a set-up, man -- Frank grabs Joe
Glares into his eyes
don't fuck around, kid
told you got my reasons
Well, forgive us, Frank
But we're going to need to hear them
beat
The wife got sick a few years ago
Insurance wouldn't pick up all the costs
So  went to the bank
They wouldn't help cover the difference
We were going to retire to the Loire valley
() We had to use all our savings to cover the bills
( ) The man gave it to you, huh
94
spent everything we had -- then she died
thirty years 've been at that bank
What was her name
Annie
Her name was Annie
'm Sorry
The moment just hangs there
November 23rd
The money's delivered at eight and picked up at midnight
He turns to Henry
(') retire in two weeks
This is it
() You set up the table
make sure dinner arrives hot
- and  walk up to the theatre
They've got coffees
It's drizzling
They both look up
Shit
: "Chekhov's `The Cherry Orchard'
Opens 23rd, 8 " (') Opening night
And
That's soon
We're going to have pull some nights
Henry thinks
Maybe we should wait
Do it closing night
95
Max turns
We can't
He's retiring
This is a one time deal
() told you there were going to be tests, Henry
Henry absorbs that
Looks at Max
(') You're going to have to leave her
() No looking back
: - Peels into the drive
is wheeled inside
,   - Walking down a corridor toward a '  at the far end
The doors open for him
he hesitates ' in profile, smiling and talking to a seated receptionist who touches her very pregnant belly
Henry takes a step back, the doors close
He watches through the glass a moment
Debbie looks radiant
Peaceful
Happy
Walks back outside again
It's as if he got all the answers he needed
- Max and Joe are digging
Looks like they've been at it for hours - covered in dirt and sweat
Henry enters the tunnel
There he is
96
Henry picks up his shovel
Starts to dig
He goes at it hard
Max catches his mood
(') You okay, Henry
No
He turns to Max
(') 'm not leaving her
Who
The girl -- He throws down his shovel
(') Now listen, Henry
You're digging this tunnel
And you're gonna rob that bank
You're gonna take the money and you're gonna put it in the car and we're gonna drive away
() This is one thing
Julie is another thing
This is not that
That is not this
Understand
Hey
think  got something
Joe furiously digs his shovel into the caked-in dirt above his head
Suddenly the ceiling of dirt comes free burying Joe who struggles to get out
Above, from where the dirt once was, is the smooth surface of concrete
The bottom of the vault
We have arrived
Look at that
Joe gets to his feet - he looks dazed
'  - Henry and Max are finished packing up the apartment
Henry looks out the window
beautiful clear blue sky
97
Not a cloud in the sky
So clear you can see tomorrow
() You're a good man, Henry
Thank you
You too, Max
Let's go
: - line at the box office
mill around, waiting for friends or chatting, everyone anticipating a great evening of theatre
,   - The cast, dressed for stage, is gathered in the green room, chatting nervously to one another
Standing on opposite sides of the room
Hush descends as  walks in
In this `American dream' of ours, everyone is happy and smiling, they have achieved their objectives
and yet in life there is only change, upheaval, the birth of the new
and that birth is painful
avoiding Henry's gaze
(') Our play is about misery, disconnection, a future that we don't see hitting us like a train
but tonight, my players, we show them
that this not a future to fear
He leaves
The players applaud -- () Off the cushion in the corner ; double into the centre pocket
Everyone laughs
98
Ten minutes people
'   - Julie sits by her vanity finishing her make-up
knock on the door
Come in
Henry appears
She's surprised
want you to meet me in California
Henry, we've been over this -- We're doing it tonight
She sits there
What
It's the only time we can get in the -- Of course
Opening night
What else
Like said, everything always fucks up -- Nothing's fucked up
If it's tonight or a month from now, what's the difference still want you to meet me
Nothing's fucked up
Have you looked around recently
You're leaving
What about the goddamn play
Arnold's coming back
Max arranged it already
'm sure he did
He approaches her
want us to be together
She laughs
That's so ridiculous to her
99
We screwed a couple of times, Henry
So what
You know that's not true -- No, really
couple of times
() Don't you get it
don't want to be with you
That cuts him dead
(') You're a thief
Go rob your bank
beat
He leaves
- Max helps seat some elderly people
Enjoy the show, folks
He checks his watch
it's two minutes to eight
He walks briskly up the aisle
- Frank watches through the glass doors out onto the empty street
He looks at his watch, sucks his teeth
- On a headset
Points to Henry
Curtain
, watching the curtain start to rise
: a long white post-modern room
Sounds of wind
It's may but frosty
100
Through the windows
in full bloom which contrast with the stark modernity of the nursery set
They're   projections on real tree trunks : enters with , holding a candelabra
Well, thank god the train is in
What time is it
(checks his watch) Almost two
(blowing out the candle) It's light already
Henry yawns and stretches
The train's late
At least two hours
Rounds a corner into view
- pulls up right in front of the First Buffalo Bank
and  jump out
Bernie knocks on the glass door
How you doin', Frank
He un-holsters his weapon, covers as Stan opens the back of the truck
Through the glass, Frank smiles
Doin' good, Bernie
Real good
He sucks his teeth
- Max bursts out the back door of the theatre, his walk turning into a run
- Julie as Madame Ranevksy enters the nursery in rapt delight
101
My nursery, my dear, beautiful, sweet nursery
This is where  used to sleep when  was a little girl
Henry as Lophakin turns to face her, waiting for her to say hello
instead she breezes past him
(') 'm still like a little girl
She kisses Gayev and Varya and then Gayev again
She kisses everyone in fact, except Lophakin
Your train was two hours late
How do you explain that
Is that good management
- Bernie breaks the seal of an envelope, hands it to Stan
Frank unlocks the plastic casing to the   for Stan who punches in the  on the slip of paper that was inside the envelope
Frank reaches into his pocket
We glimpse his phone
He presses `'
- Max struggles to the top of a telephone pole by an open electrical box
His cell phone vibrates
He pulls it out, reads it
"" He unzips a fanny pack, pulls out a  , but his hands are trembling and he drops it
Thirty feet to the ground
Shit
- Standing next to Simon, Henry watches Julie perform from the side of the stage
Oh, my childhood, my innocent childhood
used to sleep in this nursery
() 102
(') looked out from here into the garden woke up happy every morning
Isn't she beautiful
Yes
She looks out toward the window through which there is now a projection of the , this time in autumnal decay
Oh, my cherry orchard
- Waiting
as he and Bernie watch Stan load the money into the vault
You ever think what you could do with all that money, Frank
know what you'd do
Buy the Bills and put them in first place
You'd need a lot more money than that
But  guarantee you 'd have them back in the Super Bowl within two seasons
Perfect
Another chance to lose
Frank laughs nervously
- Max picks up the wire cutters off the ground, checks his watch
His heart jumps
He starts up the pole again
Finally reaches the top
Struggles to find the right wire
Oh god, oh god
Where are you, you little pischer
He finally finds the right one and   : 103
- Bernie and Stan place the last of the money in the vault
We're good
Bernie closes the vault
- Stan returns to the keypad
Begins pecking in the re- arming code -- - Max quickly attaches the

Just as he's about to hit the `Enter' button -- - Max  the bypass onto the other side of the wire and the
- Stan hits `enter' -- the vault  again
Locked indicates the alarm is on
- Max looks at the screen
The red light turns
He sighs, relieved
(
) saw this excellent piece of theatre yesterday
Really very funny
104
-  -- 'm sure it wasn't in the least funny believe people like you should examine their own lives instead of going to the theatre to observe other peoples
True enough
To be honest
We live a stupid life
- Frank, Stan and Bernie are by the truck
Well this is it, Frank
We got you something
little retirement gift
Bernie produces a neatly wrapped gift
(') Go ahead
Open it
Frank does
It's a bag of coffee
Thanks guys
We wanted to get you something from France
You like French Roast, right
Thanks
() You know this isn't from France
What are you talking about
It's French roast
Right
But over there they call it coffee
(slightly baffled, at Bernie) But this is French roast
105
- Joe and Eddie in the tunnel, waiting
Eddie looks at his watch
Where is he
Where's that old man
- Max pulls open the door, sweating, runs inside
straight into Julie
Julie -- Break a leg
Play's already started, Max
She walks past him
(') Good-bye confidence man
Good-bye, Julie
'    - Max hurries down the stairs, rushes into Henry's dressing room
- Max opens the armoire, looks inside to a waiting Joe and -- Go
Go
Go
About time, old man
Do your job
Joe leans over and pukes on the ground
Jesus
Not again
What is it with you
Sorry
106
Eddie looks at him
You're a pussy, Joe, you know that
Eddie grabs the drill
Starts to make a hole
Joe starts to prepare the charges
- Lophakin and Madame Ranevsky perform
Well, what should we do
Tell us what to do
tell you every day
Every day  say the same thing over and over
You must rent out the Cherry Orchard and the rest of the Estate for villas
At once, right this second, the auction is coming up very soon -- muffled  (o
s
) Henry freezes
Julie looks at him
It's all so vulgar
Another muffled  (o
s
) this time the audience looks around
Julie glares at him
- Henry rushes in to the tunnel to find Joe and Max staring at the underside of the steel bank vault
It's like a gleaming jewel
That was good, kid
Good acting
(a little giddy) There she is
Henry reaches up, touches the steel vault bottom, rubs it
Get out of there
Eddie arrives in his protection suit, holding a thermite burning tool
(') This shit comes straight from hell
107
They scramble out
He puts his protective helmet on
Lights it
It's like an inferno - 's manic face behind the mask, a man possessed, screaming, a river of molten steel dripping down right in front of him
The bottom of the vault drops onto the ground
- Smoke clears to reveal
He pulls off his hood
Welcome to my world, bitches
They all look up at
Fuck, yeah
- as his head rises into view through the newly cut hole
He climbs in and touches the saran-wrapped   , subdivided into bricks
He sits on it
Thinking
It's dead quiet in here
Max pops his head up
Stares at the cash : () You're on, Henry
(
) Is the cherry orchard sold
- Audience's  as Madame Ranevsky faces Lophakin on the other side of the stage
It's like a showdown
Yes
108
Who bought it
Pause
did
Madame Ranevsky is overwhelmed by the news
Varya takes her keys and throws them on the floor
Exits in a rage
(') bought it
Wait a minute ; don't rush me
'm all dizzy
can't talk
-- , Stuff duffel bags full of cash
Deb's gonna freak
- Lophakin swirls on stage
and now the Cherry Orchard is mine
Mine
() God
God in heaven
The Cherry Orchard is mine
Tell me 'm drunk, tell me 'm out of my mind, tell me 'm dreaming
- , Finish lining up the duffels of cash by the door
That's everything
Yes, it is
Max freezes, suddenly notices Eddie is standing there with   pointed at him and Joe
What's that, Eddie
109
It's a gun, Max
Max doesn't seem so surprised
(') (with the gun) Joe
Take the money out back to my car
Joe doesn't move
Eddie waves the gun
(') Joe
Max boldly steps right in front of the gun
Stay right where you are, Joe
Eddie puts the gun to Max's stomach
Don't be stupid, Max
You're not going to do this, Eddie
Eddie smiles
(') You can shoot me dead if you want, but you're going to have to shoot me dead
Eddie  Max in the gut, then pops him in the head as he throws him back
'm not playing with you, old man
What are you doing, Eddie
The door swings open --  -- walks in on the scene
Welcome to the party, Brando
Seeing the gun, Henry freezes at the door
Eddie's in the middle, Max and Joe by the mouth of the tunnel, Max on the floor, a gash on his forehead from Eddie's blow
What are you doing, Eddie
Eddie turns at him
It's money, Henry
Money
110
This was your chance you idiot
You could've been a better man but you did it again
You messed up
And now you're back with the maggots
Just one big missed opportunity
Eddie kicks him again
Yeah
Come on, Eddie
We're here
We're done
He's right
Come on, man
Shut up, Joe
Get the money
Put it in the car
Shut up
He turns back to Henry
(') Now move, Torne
No happy ending for you
He gestures to the tunnel
Joe suddenly turns back, grabs Eddie's gun hand from behind
They wrestle
Joe bites Eddie's hand
(') You animal
Max, straddling Eddie, grabs his head, bangs it on the : Famach deh mohl
Gey lig mitt'n vahntzin son of a bitch
Henry, a little dazed, picks up the gun
( ) Get the extension chord
He does
They roll Eddie over, start to hog tie his hands then his legs
Eddie starts to freak out
You couldn't have done this without me
Our new partner
Huh
Max stuffs a glove into Eddie's mouth but Eddie still kicks like crazy
Max notices Henry's thigh
111
(') You ok
Henry sees it now too
It's a graze
got shot
Henry hears the tannoy
It's his cue
He's late
(') gotta get on stage
He rushes out
- On stage, the lights come up revealing a standing behind the scrim, axes by their side
They walk out onto the stage
Thank you, my friends, thank you
Lophakin rushes on stage
He's late
Yasha, holding a tray with small tumblers of champagne, shoots him a look
Madame Ranevsky enters from the other side, hands out cash to the line of hooded figures
The peasants have come to say good-bye
() They're good fellows, Yermolai Aleksayovich but in my opinion a little stupid
(to Madame Ranevsky) You gave them everything in your purse, Lyuba
Wrong, quite wrong
couldn't help it
couldn't help it
Gayev and Madame Ranevsky walk past Lophakin, ignoring him on their way out
(still a little out of ) Won't you please come here and drink a glass as a good-bye

- Eddie, gagged and bound, lies in the middle of the tunnel as Max closes the door to the dressing room
Old man, huh
Eddie tries to scream but he can't
As Max shuts the door all light is blotted out
/ positioned now by the cherry trees behind the scrim and back-lit
We're going and not a soul will be here until after we're gone
Until spring
She notices he's clutching his thigh
- Max and Joe load the last of the duffels filled with cash into the back of Joe's car
They get inside
Joe starts the engine
Where is he
Any minute now
- Goodbye, home
Goodbye to the old life
Hello to the new life
Trofimov exits with Anya
Varya looks around the room and exits
Yasha and Carlotta exit with the dog
Lophakin to Madame Ranevsky and Gayev : Until the spring, then
Goodbye my friends, until we meet again
113
As he and Julie exchange a final look
She watches him go
it's as if he's moving in slow motion
My sister
My sister
Oh, my dear, sweet, lovely orchard
My life, my youth, my happiness, farewell
Farewell
(
) Mamma
(
) Aa-oo
- Henry comes out the back door
Gets in the car
How's the leg
It's fine
Go
Joe guns it
Sitting in the back
: -- The Peasants/hooded figures raise their axes
They suddenly have the manner of executioners
They stand ready to fell Madame Ranevsky's beloved orchard
(as Madame Ranevsky) One last look at these walls, these windows
Dear mother used to love to walk about in this room
My sister
My sister
(
) Mamma
114
(
) Aa-oo
(as Madame Ranevsky) We're coming
The sound of the   as they chop the trees behind her
It's horrific
Madame Ranevsky holds her hands over her ears and falls to the ground
and begins to weep
- Stop the car
Henry
Joe, stop the car
He can't stop the car, it's the getaway
Yeah, you can't -- Joe screeches to a halt
Henry gets out of the car
What the hell are you doing
Henry starts to run back toward the theatre as best he can
Max sticks his head out the window
(') Henry
But he's already gone
- The   finish destroying the orchard litter the stage
Madame Ranevsky still holds her hands over her ears on the ground
115
As the cacophony ends, she gets up slowly and turns to walk off the stage
: Coming down the aisle is as Pause
He comes closer
He's limping slightly
had to come back
couldn't get on the train
The moment  stepped on the platform, the blood drained from my heart
, in shock
(') knew  might never see you again
He steps up on the stage
What is he doing
Why is Lophakin back
had to come back
( ) Henry, what is this
What are you doing
This is the only way you'll listen to me
She looks out to the audience
awaiting Madame Ranevsky's response
You should have gotten on that stupid train
You made a mistake
The mistake would have been getting on that train without telling you how  feel
Ha
Don't pretend you care about me
All you care about is money
116
She tries to get past him
He blocks her
You think this is about money
Yes
He grabs her
It's never been about money
You know that
Let go of me
No
Damn it
Just leave, Henry
(under her breath) Get off the fucking stage -- Take a chance
Meet me in Moscow
No, 'm perfectly happy here
That's not true
Meet me in Moscow
She tries to get away again
Let me go
can't
Pause
Why are you doing this
You're just afraid
'm not afraid of anything -- She kicks out at him
(') What am  afraid of Henry
Tell me
117
You're afraid because  love you
That hits her
Pause
She breaks away from him, stepping back
On the side of the stage
what
She searches his expression now
Meet me in Moscow
She can't move
The audience is rapt
(') () Tell me you'll meet me in Moscow
There are tears in her eyes now
Go with him
Meet him in Moscow
at the back of the theatre
Stunned : ( ) He loves her
She whispers softly
Looks down at his leg
Henry
You're bleeding
know
Darek is alive once more
118
(whisper to Simon) Lights down ten
Down ten more
Slowly
Julie and Henry in silhouette now
Oh, fuck, Henry
The lights fade, as an image of appears on the projection screen
: : ,  - which become   on a  , widening to reveal an orchard, the most beautiful you've ever seen
Frank sits at a table outside in the garden
He pours himself a Pernod
He looks happy as a clam
jumps in his lap, purring
Hello miou-miou
He looks out at the lush valley below
Smiles
: ,     - state of the art hospital room
No expense has been spared
shaky image of 's face as  frames the video camera
comes into view now
It's beautiful
And screaming its little lungs out
(
) It's a girl

hands the baby to Debbie
Joe looks on, tears stream down his face
: - We follow   past a row of palm trees as he enters a traditional-looking   : "' - " '   - The Mailman hands a few letters to the pretty front desk Max, his back to us, finishes a shave, talking his customer's ear off
Time is a medium of exchange
You can buy things with it
Education
Self-respect
You can even figure out your dream
The Guy nods
Max turns
We see him now
He's super tan
He pulls the sheet off his client
(') You're done
Next
Another   sits down
There's a few of them waiting their turn, enjoying Max's schtick
The front desk girl hands Max the mail
: `Our dream is our truth is our destiny
Love
xx' Max smiles
Flips over the postcard and only now when he pins it above the mirror do we finally see what it is -- an image of

What's your dream
Fade up on : what looks like the
It's hot
There are insects buzzing around and it doesn't look like rain's landed anywhere near here in years

Sitting right below the Hollywood sign now

Looking down on the whole basin of Los Angeles
She hands him a bottle of water
He drinks
Look
You can see the ocean
He puts his arm around her
`Your brother says 'm an upstart, a money grubber
but  don't care a bit
' She laughs
they kiss in the sun for a while
-  - is being questioned by the unseen
(
) 'm only going to ask you one more time, Eddie
Who was it
Who helped you
told you before
Dopey
Sleepy
Happy and Doc -- The slap knocks Eddie to the ground
He's under the table now, his face crushed by the Detective's  : (
) You know what you are Vibes
liar, a cheat, a thief and a loser
He presses his boot down harder  '  : may be all those things but one thing 'm not
is a rat
Eddie smiles
His face squashed sideways like that, it's a pretty strange kind of smile
