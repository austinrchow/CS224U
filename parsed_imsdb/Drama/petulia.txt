Written by Larry Marcus March 30, 1967 1 The story begins in this grubby alley, where two extra large ambulances screech to a stop beside a loading platform
Onlookers gather in the alley entrance to see how many people died; nobody died, the backdoors of the ambulances are opened by attendants, and six perfectly fine victims of perfectly terrible automobile accidents are lifted into wheelchairs
The cripples are beautifully dressed, the men in tuxedos, the women in splendid evening dresses
One of the women wears a neck brace which forces her always to look skyward, so she cantt see the beautiful orchid corsage pinned to her bosom
Quickly, attendants roll the wheelchairs past all the stacks of fruit and vegetables on the loading platform, past great bales of laundry, past whatever horrors one finds behind the warm, smiling face of a hotel
Watch- men, pastry cooks, valets are watching the rush of the wheelchairs without much interest
Then doors swing open, and we are in the tram It of the grand ballroom
2 It is a charity ball
The sign says "Shake for Highway Safety
"' The wheelchairs and their occupants no longer interest us
They are the guests of honor, and people gather about them to arrange them appealingly, and we rush past the go-go band, the shakers, and the door prize, which is a little convertible, spinning endlessly on a pedestal
reaches , who is dancing with her husband, , but trying not to lose sight of really wants to leave, but he is too polite to make it too obvious
As he bends over to put his punch cup on a table, he is bumped by the wheelchair of one of the guests of honor
He is not at all comfortable
2 It's not easy for Petulia to keep an eye on Archie; gasping faces get in the ways hunks of twisting bodies get in the way, and the dance won't end
The music stops for a second, everyone sags and thinks, "Thank God it's over," but instantly the music begins again and everyone good naturedly swears, "Those crazy kids are trying to kill us," and meanwhile Petulia sees that Archie has reached the place where you get your coat
He is searching through his pockets for the ticket that will let him reclaim his coat
All the coats are in an incredible piles and in the semi-hysterical care of a debutante attendant
' You can't leave He turns and sees Petulia
You're an official host
She nods to the ribbon and cardboard which along with 'Official Host' says Dr
Bollen
Archie takes the ribbon off, as though to pin it on Petulia
Careful
Can you tell 'm not wearing a brassiere
No
Don't think about it
It will only excite you
Archie finally finds the ticket for his coat, which the attendant now tries to find
On through this Petulia continues
` 2 That's my husband over there, Ahh
've been married six months and 've never had an affair, It can happen Don't take it so bloody well
've just turned you down
He's looking at us
My husband, somewhere near the free whiskey table asking for Pernod, which, of course, they don't have
The father is watching the charity affair with utter disapproval
He tips a waiter by shoving a half-dozen raffle tickets into the waiter's jacket pocket, , hope you win the car, sir, Mrs
Danner is charmed by her husband's generosity
She simply adores the man
David is busy not watching Archie and Petulia, ' Isn't he gorgeous
He's a naval architect
It really zings when you say it
"My husband David is a naval architect
" Actually, we're starving
You wouldn't want to buy a sixty foot sloop
David's "Momma"` and "Poppa' keep us
Look how disgusted Poppa is
He hates this sort of thing
2 Poppa is too sensitive
' Sensitive, my ass
He's bored
Highway safety's so blah
Also, he hates amateurs
Give him something he can sink his teeth into - "Rheumatoid Arthritis"  "Muscular Dystrophy"' -m and he's the best there is
real pro
little lame girl with a ribbon in her hair and a crutch under her arm, and Poppa can set the world on fire
He's really slumming tonight
' Hello, Archie
have been joined by  and , Archie's best friends
Barney and Wilma are taking off their coats
Barney is already beginning to move to the music
0 Wilma is doing absolutely nothing but looking at Petulia
Everybody came late
came early
'bye Wilma
'bye Barney
Could you describe the coat
coat
raincoat
Sleeves
Barney has begun to snap his fingers and move his shoulders, becoming part of "The Scene", about which Wilma couldn't care less
You can't go, Archie
'd be very 2 Archie accepts this silently, Alright, then
won't tell you who bumped into last week buying a well larded rib roast
Smarty
Have you seen what she's done to her hair
Wild, huh
said, "Polo, for heaven's sake, you look like a teenager
" Archie doesn't seem too interested and, besides, all this is said while Wilma continues to look at Petulia
Your Mike's getting so fat
Is that much weight good for a boy his age
() If it's alright for a rib roast Smarty
Barney suddenly forgets the music to rescue his Vicuna coat which the debutante is smothering under other coats as she finally finds Archie's
(to Petulia) don't believe we've met
Screw you, Wilma
Now you've met
2 Wilma moves off with Barney
Archie can't spend one more second with his coat
He simply puts it on, and turns to leave, walking toward the door
My name is Petulia, Itm not surprised, Polo's your wife, Ex-wife, ' night
Petulia turns to face her husband David, who has taken a few steps toward her
She whirls around to face the departing Archie
Archie
He turns, almost at the door
Say something warm
Like what
mean it There is something goofily desperate in her voice that stops him
He looks at her for awhile
Your hair, It gleams
() Oh, Archie
Left arm or right
How do you brush it
Left
An hour a day
0 At least
2 You' 11 have a problem
The bursa sheath
Very sensitive, Bursitis
It'll hurt
'll come to you
wouldn't be able to help much
Just aspirin
And sympathy
Sure
_ Thank you, Archie
Damn it, how can  have an affair with an unmarried man
There has to be some equality of guilt
My divorce doesn't become final till next month
'll get my purse
But in turning to do so she sees David, then the spinning car, the door prize
What
've been told that 'll be the one to draw the winning ticket
'm always picked for things like that
radiate incorruptibility
Money can't buy me
She shakes her head, thoughtfully
During all this the door- man has been busily opening and closing the door for them as they keep changing their mind
It feels so super
Suddenly, all that love
3 All we see is the wheel of a car resting on the back of a small boy, pinning him to the ground and people shocked, not knowing what to do
' Well, stay then
' Archie, why do you play this dumb game
This crappy pretense at resisting the beautiful lady
You're bloody lucky 'm even talking to you
How many kids do you have besides fat Mike
Six
'night
Actually, only one besides Mike
Meet you outside
5 motel sign: "Dream Motel
"'  concrete oval, spiral- ling up four floors
You drive to your room and everything is geared to get you to bed electronically
But you must have a car, and Petulia and Archie have come by cab
Archie is paying the cabbie
(to cabbie) You mustn't take it personal
(she indicates the "No Cabs" sign) Lucky we don't have luggage
Does this trouble you
little
suggested my place
'd always imagined a tourist cabin, with paper thin walls, the sounds of a man from Tennessee in the cabin next door, sobbing endlessly, "M4ude, Maude, Maude 8 8"' 91 Archie sees a car moving through the processes of registration
Grabbing Petulia's hand, he starts to what is presumably the entrance -- at least it is the bottom of the ramp
They arrive at the booth and Archie steps on the
place marked 'Stand Here
' screen lights up
Evenin'
Where's your auto
Archie nods for Petulia to see the
camera which is scanning them
Lost in a hailstorm this side of Pocatello, Idaho
Those hailstones really came down, didn't they, Zeke
No auto
No auto
It's a problem
Only if we make it one
Do you have any slides or swings for children
No, ma'am
You got kids
No, no
was told to be suspicious of motels which cater to the family trade
This isn't that sort of place
No auto
There is a small sound and a gadget reaches out which normally would fasten to the side of the car
On it is an electronic register, an electronic pen and a key with a great metal tag (as an example of how this might be designed,  recommend visiting a drive-in bank in Los Angeles)
As Archie registers, and puts the ten dollar bill where it belongs, Petulia looks at the
set
10 s Continued You've got a very nice ,, face
Thank you, ma' amp, You have to use pancake make-up, things like that
(a slight giggle) No, just be natural
Archie has finished registering and takes the keys
We've got an elevator but its just for going out for the paper and the like
mean when you don't want to take the car
You'll have to use the ramp because of the key
It lets you know when you get to your room
Archie and Petulia start up ramp
It's a long dark run and they are soon winded, () () It shouldn't be charming
You're missing the whole point
It should be menacing
,, Another couple in a proper car, rushes by
There is a blaze of headlights, and a rush of sound
,
gray
terribly distraught headlights of passing cars lighting up our room
,
Archie tugs at her, and gasps
11 6 () a police car careening down the highway, sirens going full blast
And  plunge madly into your arms But she is now totally winded and cannot say another word
Archie reacts to a sudden phenomena: a tiny light on the key in his hand starts flicking on and off furiously
Just ahead of him is the door of their motel room
Archie is aghast at the pulsating key
() My apartment's only four blocks from 7 Stark is hardly the word but it will have to do control panel takes care of the drapes,
, stereo, announcements from the office, etc
, etc
, etc
There are mirrors everywhere and the first thing Petulia does is establish contact between the vanity mirror, the mirror on the bathroom door and the medicine cabinet mirror so that she is reflected endlessly
You have 624 women in this room and 'm still counting
Archie moves behind her and begins unbuttoning the top buttons on the back of her dress
() Just wait a minute, okay
Archie plops on the bed in his coat, a most iropic smile on his face -- he is beginning to suspect he is not going to get laid
Petulia is examining all the Petulia faces in the mirrors
My great-grandmother is ninety-one and still has a granite chin
Archie pushes a gadget beside the bed and it begins to vibrate
Petulia sees endless Archies vibrating on endless beds
12 7 What a lecherous lot She's ninety-ones eh
But no fun
Not at ninety-one, hell She stopped having fun at twenty-eight when her husband was killed in the first war, in a trench looking just like Cary Grant with a waxed moustache
She can't remember him but she does remember Cary Grant because he is from Bristol, too, and often in the news
If his picture is in the paper he gets a waxed moustache whether he likes it or not
She turns to face Archie
She is afraid and she is angry and she doesn-t know quite what to do from one moment to the next
But she knows he shouldn't be in an overcoat jiggling on a jiggling bed, Stop being so damn casual
Archie sits up but is still casual, We're about i12td become lovers, Did you bring an instrument, Archie
Eh
Ring for room service
Ask the robot for something splendid and musical,, Saxophone
Electric Organ
Tuba
tuba
Absolutely; Bless you, Ar--hie; tuba; Something large and twirly and pom to pom
pomX Archie, this is an event
We 0 are about to become lovers
7 You said that
It can't be said often enough
Are we
Are we what
About to become lovers
No
Ah, you swinging young marrieds
He leaves
8 Across from the ramp there is the elevator the man on mentioned
Archie is already there waiting for it to arrive
Petulia starts toward him angrily
Where do you have to rush
If we were making love you would be exploring my navel about now
Time would be the last thing on your mind
An old man in a bathrobe, sadly out of contrast with the electronic motel, looks up from the open trunk of his car
The elevator doors open
Petulia and Archie enter, 9 The elevator doors shut and inside the elevator a loud speaker begins playing a medley of San Francisco songs
You
look like a gargoyle
Poor, dumb Archie
'm all mixed up sexually
Old Mum's a prostitute
The oldest professional lady in 0 all Bristol
Mavis, too, my sister
But mean she's not a landmark yet
9 During this Archie notices that the back of Petulia's dress remains unbuttoned
He moves behind her and begins rebuttoning her
At the touch of his hand, something happens to Petulia
10 Archie's hands are holding a little boy under the bright lights of a first aid table
The boy is a bloody mess but Archie's hands are soothing him even as they so gently prod, examining his injuries
Nurses are cutting the boy's bloody jeans off him, an expensive watch falls to the floor, they retrieve it
11 Petulia's head presses against Archie's hand
She kisses it, she rubs her cheek against it
The elevator has come to a stop and the doors have opened
Archie sees Petulia's tears on his hand
Real honest-to-God tears, Petulia
Tears, Archie
Petulia, you're a kook
He exits the elevator and whistles at a cruising cab
12 Archie crosses to the cab and opens the door
He hustles Petulia inside the cab
If he gets you there in time, you can still pick the winning ticket and make somebody happy
(very quietly) Archie, 'm going to marry you
The cab pulls away and Archie sees Petulia looking at him through the rear window
Archie allows himself the drollest of smiles
It's the Pepsi generation 0 He walks into the night alone
15 12 Continued jalopy full of dizzy dames with "" painted in huge awkward letters on its side almost runs him down
Archie continues in the night
Now, we can see the Golden Gate Bridge
13 The house is on the edge of the sea and a cliff rises behind it
Petulia is going up the open lift which climbs the cliff
It is a very different Petulia
She hurts
' Archie is sleeping
There is the  of a bell ringing
After awhile Archie's hand reaches out for the phone
(into phone) 'm up, thanks
Then his dizzy brain realizes the ringing is continuing and is constant
He sees the alarm clock, 6:1 He stumbles and staggers to the front door
Yeah
yeah 000 yeah 000 He opens the door to come face to face with the large and twirly front end of a tuba
The tuba is stark white for no particular reason
14A
' We see some of the hall, a yawning milkman, etc
, but mostly Petulia and the tuba
14B
' Dazedly,
Archie steps back to make room for Petulia and the tuba
'll make some coffee
Petulia blows with all her strength, emitting a sad little peep, then collapses to the floor, tuba and all
16 14B Continued Aren't  a kook
If you think you're (at the same time) No, 've been up for hours, waiting for the doorbell to ring, , 0 think how surprised the-man who owns the pawnshop is going to be when he sees all that broken glass
14C brick smashes the glass, scattering cameras, mandolins, etc
in the midst of which is the white tuba
' Archie, how come the burglar alarm didn't go off
14D
'
0 The scene continues
Wherets it all going to end if the burglar alarms won't go off
Take me to bed, Archie, Get the hell out of here
please
He reaches to help Petulia to her feet but as he touches her waist to lift her, she screams and faints, 15 But we don't know it's the Danner house
All we see is Petulia crumpling as she is struck
She hits the floor and just lies there, not making a sound
(Also  in slow motion
) 16
' Archie breaks an ammonia ampule under Petulia's nose
Her head wrenches away and she opens her eyes
Archie has begun to prod her side; she is in pain
17 16 've got a broken rib,  think,  can feel it broken, Archie
Don't you know you can puncture a lunge Hopping around with tubas and stuff -- isntt it kooky, though
Archie has begun to remove her dress
When are we going to stop trying to undress me
Shut up
Leave me alone, Archie
Archie sees she really means it, It's just a rib to me, That's why
Call a proper doctor, What do you think  am
hairy legged old lecher running around in pajama bottoms, Get your clothes off, As a woman, not as a rib
Archie is harassed
The phone begins ringing
He grabs it angrily
(into phone) 'm awake
'm awake; How many times are you gonna call He hangs up, then realizes this was the first wake up call
18 16 (to Petulia) You know what a- you'll drive me cuckoo
He sighs
and begins dialing a number
Petulia is in real pain
Like a,little child she crawls under the covers of his bed, pulling the quilt up around her as though Archie's left over warmth will make the pain go away
(into phone) Barney
Archie
Fine fine , , fine , want you to look at a patient for me
Now
At my place
My apartment, Barney, it's very complicated and  haven't had my morning coffee yet
Her name is Petulia
don't know her last name, Barney
Yes, Petulia
Barney, shut up
have to get to the hospital
16A ' During the above we catch a glimpse of sleepy Barney sleepily asking stupid questions
16B
' Archie hangs up, goes to a medicine case which he had hastily opened for the ammonia ampule and now he takes out a couple of pills, which he gives to Petulia,
She takes them obediently, You've got a super build for a man your age
Archie says nothing
He crosses to the bathroom and hastily begins dressing
Where are all the family pictures
Archie is busy brushing his teeth, () The family pictures
He looks out from the bathroom blankly, Polo and the boys
Archie goes back to brushing his teeth electrically, with salt
19 16B Continued a 'll bet you named her Polo
Don't ever start mucking about with "Petulia"
Archie exits from the bathroom, all the time continuing to dress, WhatAs her real name
Prudence
And you named her Polo
That's kind of sickening, Archie
Archie stops his dressing long enough to gaze at this girl in his bed, beyond which is an overturned tuba
Archie sighs somewhat philosophically, not nearly as amused as you'd think
17 We are in the examining room of the orthopedic ward
Archie is working on Oliver, the little Mexican boy of seven whom we have seen earlier as a bloody mess in the flashback
Now, Oliver is healing nicely, but it's still not pleasant to be examined
woman hovers in the back- ground
nurse assists Archie
Oliver is a brave, solemn little boy, with shadows of fatigue around his eyes
He is also a tough little bastard, let me tell you
He is now wearing the broken gold watch; though to fit his skinny wrist the band has been tied in a knot, want him here every day
For therapy
Si, Yes, doctor
do, Oliver speaks only a few words of English, mostly the necessary scatological and sexual phrases that would be necessary in his line of business
Every day
Tell him that
The woman says it to Oliver in Spanish
Oliver says something obviously obscene
20 17 What'd he say
() He say yes
(dubiously, to woman) You sure
(to Oliver) Otherwise we keep you in the hospital
You're not well, just better
(to woman) Say that
The woman tells Oliver in Spanish as Archie continues examining the leg
Sorry, pal
Oliver says something in Spanish
: (smiling a bit) Where he learn such words shame on you
(then in Spanish) Shame
Archie realizes Oliver is in great pain and close to tears
He stops the examination and rubs his hand gently through the kid's hair, Every day
Same time
Two o'clock, right on the dot
(he hits watch on wrist
The last bit of glass falls out
) Sorry , , Oliver swears in Spanish and the woman clacks her tongue
() He terrible
() like the way he heals
21 17 Archie smiles and leaves
The nurse is left with Oliver who avoids her touch, Cut that out, you little spit, 18 Archie stops to hear what the woman has to say
About the bill, Doctor
Barney is passing by
Is she okay
() Lunch
Archie looks up at the woman
a His leg will be fine
Don't worry too much about the bill
Just enough to pay it
have money to pay it, pipe smoking public relations man leads a casually dressed group past Archie and the woman
Yea, we had  filming a documentary here last week 19
20' All through the scene Barney and Archie will be served by topless waitresses while other topless waitresses slide down a big brass pole in the centre of the room
As the scene begins Barney is alone, morosely munching a corned beef sandwich
Now Archie appears, threading his way through topless fashion show
topless  is doing the fashion commentary into a chrome microphone, as the topless models majestically move about
22 0 19 (no fashion cliche untouched) Springtime in Paree
Our elegante dinner pajamas
In airy aquamarine chiffon and Mediterranean blue peau de soie
Delightfully carefree, yet formal enough for an ambassadorial reception at the Palace of Versailles
"Screw you, Wilma
" Why didn't you tell me
How is she
You tell me
Oh, great, terrific, you wouldn't believe it
Terrific
And her rib
taped it
Gave her some seconal
a Should have a vertical just to be safe
waitress hovers Why do we have to eat topless
The best Irish stew in town
He is eating a corned beef sandwich
Archie is ordering the same
She said you beat her up
Kidding, of course
Archie bites into his sandwich with small enthusiasm
Breasts with their pasties always intrude
You must have been a little rough on her, daddy
23 19 The second model, a beautiful topless Negress, is now wandering past the tables
The announcer goes on and on
Opening Night at the Opera
Though the curtain has risen on the first act of Aida, all eyes are on the Royal Box, Mi Lady in dazzling velvet: Cardinal Richelieu Rouge
The utter simplicity of her full-length gown is subtly accented by the merest suggestion of gay abandon
Archie eats his sandwich
An off-duty topless waitress sits in the corner having lunch, holding a napkin over her bosom with one hand, while eating with the other
Archie
Barney
() You know how long 've known you
Forever
That's how long
And Polo and the kids
That's exactly how long
Another silence
Archie is watching the brass pole
Every other girl sliding down looks like Petulia
Archie accepts his hallucination with mild pleasure
Barney will not be stopped
' So  have a right to my opinion; It's breaking Wilma's heart; That's all we talk about
You think you're different than anybody else
Every time  leave my house it's the last time, 'm never coming back
You're not listening to me, Archie
' Barney, for Chrissake, 'm listening to you, ' You're thinking about that hot cat in your bed, you bastard
24 19 Now, in the continuous luncheon fashion show, the "Psychedelic Yvonne" has appeared, topless amid a wild pattern of lights, The dialogue between Barney and Archie continues elsewhere as the orgy of colors becomes: 20 The left side of a patient's face and the right shoulder and arm of the patient's body are sprayed with a special liquid which instantly dries a violent blue and then very quickly starts changing into all the colors of the rainbow
These various colors indicate physical conditions
They are watched, measured, and timed by Archie, Barney and their assistants, ' My record is far from spotless, if you don't know that, who does
But baby, it's just not the answer, not at our age
' So what's the answer, baby
' a Someplace you can belch without saying excuse me
' can do that in the steam room at the
' (going right on) And if a little monkey business comes along, whose gonna throw rocks
You and Polo were a marvellous looking couple
21 The patient is in a lead room being scanned by an atomic computer
The activator moves in a rhythmic, graceful pattern over the patient's drab, withered body
In the control area Archie and Barney listen to the strange sounds emanating from the computer, each sound again indicating a physical condition
The patient's room looks like a comfy hotel room: wood paneling, couches, magazines, plants
The door leading to outside is three inches thick and solid lead
The noise from the equipment is deafening
25 21 10 ' Is there something wrong with being a groovy looking couple
People turning around to stare
What was it, Archie
The sex bit
Huh
The ole sex bit ,,,
' Barney, what would you say if  told you that one day  just got very tired of being married
22 This is a really glorified pressure chamber where a complete atmosphere is created to suit whatever surgery is going on
The patient can no longer be seen
He is draped in plastic which creates a sub-atmosphere
The doctors and nurses are swathed in plastic, again in the atmosphere that lets them function best, (This is for real
It exists, for instance, at Mt
Sinai Hospital in New York
) The doctors and nurses communicate with each other through throat mikes and seem like other world automatons
In all this the patient simply does not exist
The colors are eerie yellows and blues with only occasionally and very impersonally the red of blood, ' (he never listens) It's still better than being out there in the dark, all by your goddam lonesome
Nobody has a life anymore
Quicksand, It scares me
What do you want, Archie
23
' Archie and Barney are in a white cubicle playing handball
Their dialogue, of course, continues, () don't know what  want
To feel something, () That's no answer; Archie, grow up
The ball comes whizzing at Barney who suddenly wants it to hit him, which it does, Archie, what am  going to do about Wilma
26 24
' Archie has just parked his car and is going toward the entrance, when he sees Petulia sitting on a bus-stop bench, the tuba beside her
She is dozing
() Hey, you
She opens her eyes, smiles
'm drunk
It's the stuff Barney gave you
'm drunk
'll drive you home
Thank you, 'll take the bus
Don't be silly
Don't pry, Archie
How'm  prying
'll go home by bus
If  were prying,  would ask you how you broke your rib
Right
You fall on a tuba and you break your rib
Right
Wrong
The rib was broken hours before your fall
' During this the bus comes to a stop
Petulia rises shakily to board it but she can't go through the entrance with the tuba
27 Anytime you're ready, Lady
'll keep it for you
It has to be returned
"Friends of the Evergreen," Archie looks blank
It's a lodge
In Chinatown
On Grant
Ask for Mr
Howard
The bus driver really leans on his horn to make everything charming
(shouting above horn) Petulia, take a cab
(shouting above horn) Don't pry, Archie: She groggily enters the bus, leaving the tuba in Archie's arms
25 Petulia takes a seat at an open window
The bus is now stopped for a moment more by the traffic light
Petulia, under the best of circumstances doesn't make much sense, and now she's quite groggy
Will you remember that
"Friends of the Evergreen
" Petulia, where are you going
Mr
Howard
Tell him 'm sorry  goofed
Archie, you know something
The tuba makes you look ten years younger, and you'know
Thingy 0 The bus starts with a jolt and Petulia winces in pain
28 26 Petulia is wincing with pain as she puts groceries on the shelf
David is watching her, concerned
Petulia
Hi
You okay
Uh huh
Sure
Of course
Just before --- 'm fine
for a split second there Ism okay
thought maybe you David
Somehow or other we begin to sense that madness has entered what is really a commonplace scene
Something has gone wrong and we can't for the life of us under- stand what and before we can even guess, we are: 27 Petulia is still in the bus and we realize she has 0 imagined the foregoing
She gets off the bus
29 28
" "
The sign on the door identifies this as a fraternal organization, founded in 1886 for the betterment of man, but the door is securely padlocked for the night
Archie stands there, holding the tuba and feeling stupid
Haplessly, he returns to his car and begins stowing the tuba inside, banging it against his nose in the process
He is a far from happy man
29
/
, Petulia is filling the noisy old electric ice box with milk, ice cream and fresh fruit
man enters from another room
He is a big, sleepy-eyed Mexican
He has just awakened, is wearing his pajama bottoms and is hairy, sweaty and fat
Petulia obviously knows tlleiman, nods hello, to which the man answers a non-committal grunt
He squeezes past Petulia to drink from the sink
He sticks his head under the tap
(she speaks slowly because he doesn't understand English) came by to make sure there was enough milk and things
He finds the situation amusing, reaching in past Petulia to grab an orange
There should be a feeling of a possible relationship between Petulia and this man
In the next room a screen door opens and closes
Petulia closes the ice box door and we and she see Oliver and the Woman standing in the doorway
30
' Archie is doing research at a desk
Working from notes, he is talking into a tape recorder about new techniques in the treatment of arthritis that would not require surgery
This is a moment to glimpse Archie as a thoughtful man
There are a couple of beer bottles nearby
The bed is still unmade
The tuba stands in the corner
The front doorbell rings and Archie crosses over to let in his wife, Polo, a very attractive young matron
30 30 Polo looks about the apartment dubiously, from tuba to unmade bed
She can't keep her eyes off the unmade bed
(after `awhile ) Hi, Polo
It's very nice
Archie looks at her questioningly
've never been here before
It's very nice
Thanks
It's strange, coming into your husband's bachelor apartment for the first time
Feels slightly illegal
Is that a tuba
That's a tuba
Make a marvelous lamp
You just had to say it
Predictable Polo
"Predictable Polo
" Has a certain zing
How're the kids
Looking forward to the weekend
Lest  forget She opens her large handbag, takes out a cellophane bag of cookies
As usual,  baked enough for an army
Okay
31 0 30 This is very strange
didntt think 'd feel like this
Mostly sad
Archie's sad, too, therefore he is more brusque than necessary
Also he is bugged by the cookies
You need anything, Polo
No
Well, yes
Well, yes and no
() think that covers all the possibilities
Polo laughs, suddenly they share a moment of warmth
It's such a puzzle
We really got on so marvelously
Never fought
Never screamed at each other
Not once
a Something in his silence, plus that damned unmade bed, is beginning to make her angry
Everybody we knew envied us
We were a handsome couple
This makes her so angry she can now say what she came to say
think 've fallen in love
The man is Warren Smith
He's an engineer and very good with the children, but he wants to go back to school and get his masters in hydraulics
(very long pause) Well, say something
() think that's fine, Polo
a () Go to hell
32 0 30 Tie phone begins ringing
Archie crosses to it
Hello
(no answer) Hello
Were going to'be married
Great
(into phone) Hello
31 ' David is on the phone and Petulia'has just entered
David hangs up the phone
a She stops
She waits for a moment, wondering if the scene she imagined on the bus is now going to occur
Will David now say, "Just for a second there
" Come on, let's eat
Morrie finally got a shipment of Dungeness crab
About time
Well, poor guy
They had all that trouble
David crosses to the dining area
And that's that
32
' Not right away
He's also divorced
There's alimony
child support It looks absolutely obscene
33 a 32 Continued Archie sees her
looking at his bed
() So the kids like him, eh
Adore him
How about that
Don't you have maid service
() What the hell are you doing, bringing me cookies
He flings the bag at her, barely missing her
They are both stunned by this outburst, ' a (shakily) Well
this is a new side of your natured For two people who never fight Absently, Polo sags down on the edge of the unmade bed, which has so fascinated her
During the following, no matter what their bodies happen to be doing, Polo and Archie continue to speak in a most logical manner
What's so great about not fighting
came to tell you about Warren, You told me about Warren
He sits beside her, well not really beside her, actually as far away from her as the bed will permit
She decides she will instantly get up off the bed, but she does not
() Warren is working for his m'tstah's in hydraulics
34 0 32 Polo knows she shouldn't smile at Archie making fun of Warren, but she does
Archie touches her smile with his finger, then his hand moves across her face, to the back of her neck
It is a clumsy gesture and they clumsily sprawl on the bed
Well, 'm afraid well still need all the money you pay me
And 'll be seeing him, Archie 32A
' It's a nice enough room, which makes what she says later quite absurd,' She and Warren are preparing for bed Am already in a boring ritualistic fashion; she with curlers in her hair, he hanging his trousers on a hanger, , (continuing) , at the house
mean until Warren and  get married, which won't be 32B
' By now, entirely out of habit, Archie's hand has pushed up Polo's shirt, as he continues the sex ritual
Wholly out of habit, Polo lets him
Their bodies, old friends for so long, and once having been lovers, simply ignore whatever tripe their mouths happen to be saying, () until he is established with some hydraulics firma  hope it won't be too long,  mean for everybody's sake
If he's a bright guy, he'll make out okay
Needless to say there are certain problems
By now, Archie is on top of Polo, and out of habit she is adjusting her body for him
35 32B Continued He lives in such a depressing, rented room
It gives me claustrophobia
Poor Polo
It's such an icky little room
Archie is, perhaps, two seconds away from entering Polo, when he suddenly sits up, wondering what the hell he's been doing
He walks to the far side of the room, sticks his shirt in, wipes the sleeve of his shirt across his face
Polo feels no particular rancor, the entire thing was totally unplanned, and she has no more desire to "make it" with Archie than he has with her
She pulls down her skirt and adjusts her garters
Tell the kids 'll come for them 0 Sunday at eight
They'll be ready
thought the decent thing was to come here and talk in a civilized manner
About the change in my situation
appreciate it, Polo
Good night, Archie
You've got a run in your stocking
Polo exits, Archie can't figure out why in the world he even thought of making love to Polo after all this time
He sits down on the unmade bed, finds one of Polo's cookies on the sheets, and pops it into his mouth
33 0 It's a busy Saturday and everything is lovely 36 33 with a bull horn is keeping people moving on the Japanese bridge
Many soldiers on pass, a few hippies, but mostly just tourists
(with bull horn) Now you folks keep moving along that bridge
You keep moving along and give other folks a chance
There's lots of pretty things to do
You keep moving right along
You won't want to forget our Niponese souvenir pagoda where every item is the real McCoy
That's right
Keep moving, that's the ticket
Sergeant, you've been standing there some time now
During this,  and Archie talk
'
s 32 and pretty
Its a nice day but Archie is not happy
Polo, Warren, maybe Petulia mostly it's kind of a lousy day to be a bachelor,
and May have been sitting on the grass
Gracefully she rises to her feet, doing everything just right, even this
0 She puts away her portable martini kit
Nobody in the world can sit on the grass and not wrinkle
She looks
No, perfect
Not even a blade of grass
Why don't  marry you, May
Why don't you, Ar^hie
They walk along holding hands
Archie should feel better than he does
Tell me about Bobby Kennedy
She looks at him, smiling
() Picasso
Pickles
She smiles tolerantly as they walk along
37 a 33 Continued) Choose a subject
Ice cubes
Any damn thing
Take either side
Talk for thirty seconds against ice cubes
() Why the hostility, Archie
That dress shop of yours
"Boutique
" 've never seen one of those
your rubber mannequins
've never once seen the pipe sticking out of their bottoms
Not once, not one damn time
That bothers me, May
May stops
She doesn1t know whether to be annoyed or amused
Shets a little of both
'm not hostile, it's frustration
In all that perfection, how could a clumsy clot like me possibly be fitted in
mean, without spoiling the whole effect
They have now reached the area of the stunted trees
Nuns are passing through empty benches; kids are improvising on the stage and shouting
Don't worry about it
You'll be going back to Polo
No, she's found a fellah
Oh
She watches the kids for a moment
'd just about given up on you, What  should do is marry you
For May this has been said once too often
She is now thoroughly annoyed
38 33 ) Archie, if it would please you, 'll submit a list of my faults, some of which might shake you up a bit
It would be a fake list
Probably, It wouldn't be a fake list
Actually,  wear arch supports, my depilatory causes a nasty little rash, and 've lost 10% of my hearing in less than a year
Okay
; They laugh, kiss, grab at each other, and hurry toward the parking lot for Archie's car
34
' Petulia waits on the steps
When she is not being observed, when she is not "on," there are moments when Petulia seems utterly forlorn
This is such a moment
But then she sees Archie and May and instantly she is "with it
" Well of all people
All that crap about the humanitarian- ism of the medical profession
She darts alongside the building and begins frantically calling to a little old man in white duck pants and an "aloha" hat, May looks at Archie questioningly
Don't ask
Petulia and the old man are back joining Archie and May on the steps
() Archie, this is Mr
Howard
0 was looking at the foundation
Once in a while you find one from before the earthquake
It's a thrill, believe you me
39 0 3L1
Continued Petulia resents any sense of cordiality at this particular time
Mr
Howard is the'watchman for the "Friends of the Evergreen
" Or was
The tuba
No wonder people are becoming cynical about doctors
tried to return it
The place was locked
No harm done, a  didn't expect this of you, Archie'
tried to return the tuba Friday ; It's
(accusingly to ) The "Friends of the Evergreen" are very proud of their brass band
All's well that ends well
Stay out of this, Mr
Howard
She sees May watching all this with wry amusement
'm Petulia Danner
'm sorry about this
40 0 35
' Mr
Howard is casually testing the valves on the tuba
She said there was this elderly lady whose first husband used to play tuba with John Phillip Sousa
She said it would cheer her up and make her want to live
She gave me five bucks
(looking at Petulia) All that broken glass (finished with the tuba) Its okay
Archie crosses to the front door and opens it
Goodbye, Mr
Howard
Goodbye, Petulia
Petulia crosses to Mr
Howard and presses a dollar bill into his shirt pocket
Take a taxi
You can at least say you're sorry, Archie
'm sorry, Mr, Howard
Goodbye, Petulia
But Petulia just sits on the edge of a chair tapping her fingers in annoyance
Mr
Howard leaves
The door remains open for Petulia to leave
May watches Petulia in amused tolerance
What's the next move, Petulia
'd like to discuss your irresponsibility
People are passing in the hallway, peering in
Goodbye, Petulia
He advances on her, somewhat threateningly
My rib
Archie slams the door shut ets a bottle and a couple g of glasses, pointedly, exclu ding Petulia
41 0 35 should explain about Petuliaa She is a kook
We are going to be married
Archie, when you try to sound cool and "with it," you're really pathetic
We're trying to have an intelligent conversation
About what
Well, about Polo, among other things
Polo is none of your damned business
That's dumb
Dumb
She's my business and she's this lady's business happen to hate Polo
(to May) Needless to say she's never even met Polo
look at you and  know Polo
(to Map) Explain that to him
May looks at Archie in bewilderment, she is not quite sure how to react; but when she makes up her mind it will be the exactly right reaction
Also, in all truth, Petulia is frightened by May
How many years were you married
, Archie
Eight
Ten
Anyhow, the best, Wasted
Gone down the drain
Oh, come on
o Archie, we are from two different worlds
We've got nothing to agree on
Except one thing
You're a lonely screwed up mess
0 Archie, 'm trying to save you
You're a very special man
42 0 35 Oh, God
Tell him, May
Petulia doesn't like May's amused reaction
You don't think so
won't put Archie on a pedestal
He'll do
() You've got yourself another winner, Archie
(to Archie) It's a joke, you're both putting me on
Petulia
mean it
Tubas
All this " Love Lucy" jazz
It's only cute for awhile
It's not meant to be cute
'm fighting for your life
Who's trying to kill me
The two million, five hundred thousand subscribers to the "Ladies Home Journal" right, dear
Petulia, go home and save what's his name
really don't want to see you anymore
Archie's voice is cold
Petulia is suddenly defeated, mostly by May
She gets up and leaves
36 It's after 3 a
m
and Archie is hollow-eyed and drenched 0 with sweat from an emergency operation
He is with a patient in the recovery room, obviously concerned about 43 i 36 Continued the patient's chances
He crosses to a sink, bathes his face and hands with cold water
He is exhausted
As we sometimes glimpse Petulia when no one else is looking and see beyond the kookiness, so for an instant we see beyond Archie's look of professional assurance and see the fearful uncertainty
He now moves into the corridor, with each step assuming the doctor's look that is expected of him
' Hi
Archie turns
Petulia is in the medical library with books scattered all about her
You're kidding
think 've discovered a cure for cancer
Well, if you're on the brink of something
How did they let you in
She joins him
You look exhausted
Do you know it's almost three
Doesn't Mr
Danner worry at all about things like that
Petulia looks at him reverently
() Look at you
Archie is so unaccustomed to hearing a straight line from Petulia that her tone and look of tenderness stop him for a moment
Then, without a word, they fall into step beside each other, leaving the hospital
37 At this time of night hardly a car remains
Archie's car is quite by itself
37 Shall  drop you off
(she doesn't answer) It's too late for the bus
She gets in
38 Petulia, you've got to stop following me around like this
Petulia is absolutely silent but her eyes are devouring him with infinite tenderness which Archie is finding very touching
It is a facet of Petulia he has never seen before
Where to
could use a steak sandwich
There's a jazz joint that stays open all night
He reaches to start the car just as she grabs at him, a awkwardly, aggressively
() Hey, come on Am why this sudden Petulia is relentless and voracious
Her hands and mouth are everywhere on Archie
car is a lousy bedroom but it will have to do
Heads bump against windows, elbows jam against steering wheels, but Petulia will not be stopped
Finally, Archie grips her shoulders and forces her to stop
No
Yes
Not here
39
- Though the streets outside are deserted, the supermarket is jammed with people
Archie is pushing a market a basket already piled high with groceries while Petulia keeps finding things to buy
Archie knows that Petulia is going through this massive shopping spree simply to get even for his rejection of the moment she chose to make love
45 a 39 Continued It m not really hungry
'm starving
Am  being punished
Loganberry jam
we'll have a case
'd rather have a new plastic raincoat
You don't save anything on plastic raincoats
Shall  get another cart
Polo can fill three or four when she really puts her mind to it
Petulia gets the point and instantly takes her place in the long line before the cashier
(as if it's Petulia's fault) You know what time it is
It's after fivB
Ilia sorry
want to go to bed
So do we
40 Petulia and Archie leave the supermarket with their rolling basket of groceries
There is no one else on the street
In front of the market is a clown on a pedestal gesticu- lating with arms and mouth at people who are not there, but making no sound
Petulia quizzically looks up at the silent violent clown, while Archie waits for her at the car
Finally he taps the horn and she turns and looks at him
She starts running toward the car, suddenly wanting 0 very much to be with him
They kiss lightly
46 9 41
'  ' Archie is sound asleep, breathing heavily
Petulia sits wrapped in a blanket on the floor near the window, her head resting on the sill, lonely
42
' Petulia is sound asleep
Through the open bedroom door we see Archie drinking a lonesome Coke
43 Petulia and Archie are both in the bed, asleep and somehow as far apart as two human beings can be
44
' In the midst of her sleep, Petulia begins jabbering in some language all her own
Archie Is eyes open and he looks at her and he smiles
Still sound asleep, Petulia finishes her statement, whatever the hell it was and settles down on the pillow
Archie looks at her
She wakes up
They look at each other so gravely that they both begin to smile
Neither one is having the best night of their life but both are aware of a sense a of tenderness that has caught them unexpectedly
45
ARCHIEtS Petulia wakes up suddenly
Though she is nude under the sheets, Archie is fully dressed for his day with the boys
Though his clothes are very sporty he looks anything but sporty as he talks quietly into the phone- (into phone) Okay
Wells why not do some slides anyhow
(in sudden anger) To satisfy myself, that's who
Okay
He hangs up the phone and sees Petulia looking at him
Well, we knocked off another one
Another notch in the old stethoscope
You're a wonderful doctor, Archie
keep a little black bow tie in my desk
In 0 case the services are in the morning and 1 have no time to go home
The neekband's all stained with sweat
47 45 Why are you dressed
Have to pick up the, kids, 'm already late
You're not abandoning me
mean,  wasn't all that bad, was
Amateur night, He leans over and kisses her mouth
Before 've brushed my teeth
Are you a communist, Archie
guess so Tell Mike to watch that weight
Will you be here when  get back
() Dumb, Archie
Dumb
Archie starts out, then stops, troubled
Yes
'm divorcing David, if that's what you mean, () That's none of my business
Petulia is suddenly hurt
Phone me
Where
48 0 45 Here
Listen, this worries me
Really
Write the Number down so you won't forget
Archie grins, sighs, and starts out
Petulia will do anything to hold him one second more
Hey,, you
Archie turns at the door
Don't have any illusions about all those groceries
can't cook
And you hate loganberry Jam
No, as a matter of fact,  rather like it
He smiles, continues out
46
&   '
He has barely gone ten steps when he is stopped by a whistle
He turns
Her head is popped out the door (or window)
Anything to hold him, anything
If somebody calls and wants medical advice on something really obscure, is it okay if wing it on my own
He makes an amused "you nuts" gesture and leaves, but not before Petulia says: Phone
He is gone
47 a  cruise boat that takes tourists across the bay is ready to go
0 47 Mike and Steven, Archie's sons, are anxiously waiting for their father to join them
Archie is in a phone booth next to the ramp that leads to the boat
The boys are yelling to Dad to come ono (into phone) Hi, (to boys) Shut up, you guys, ' Hi
What's all the noise
Mike
Fat Mike
He's not all that fat
During this series of dumb, ordinary telephone conversa- tions to follow,, we begin seeing the moments which have brought on Petulia's current crisis with Oliver
48 It's a hot summer afternoon
Petulia and David have driven down from San Francisco
They are members of the "San Francisco Matador Club"
David has drunk too much wine from his bota bag and the sour wine and the hot sun have made him violently ill
Though there are still two bulls left to kill, David and Petulia are leaving
As she moves down the spindly stairway, Petulia becomes aware of Oliver
He is with a gang of other kids at the butcher shed where the previous bulls are being dressed for market
They are all soaking banderillos in blood so they can be sold as "the real thing"
49 Petulia and David in their convertible
David has passed out in the back seat and Petulia is having a hell of a time trying to move the car out of the parking space
Again kids swarm about her like wild animals, trying to sell hats, cushions, gum, pottery, etc
Again she sees Oliver among them (or is it another kid who looks like 0 Oliver
) , 50 40 50 Thousands of cars are waiting to get through
Hot, noisy, dusty, unbearable
Kids storm every car, hustling their captured audience
Among them is Oliver
Have the others been Oliver
In Petulia's exhaustion and discomfort, the heat, the flies, the blaring horny she can't be sure
(, All through the Tijuana scenes, we  Archie and Petulia's telephone conversation
It is utterly banal and they know it and are amused by its banality
) :  was dozing
: That's good
: You left without having breakfast
:  had a cup of coffee on the way
:  cup of coffee
You should have had eggs or waffles
: 'm fine
: Me too
:  had a tall glass of pineapple juice
: Make some toast, too
And milk
Breakfast is a very important meal
:  wish you'd remember that
: Well, goodbye
0 : Archie
: Yes
: You won't forget to phone
51 Archie hangs up the phone and starts running with his sons toward the boat
He is very pleased with his absolutely nothing phone conversation
52 Children run scurrying around the mildly crowded deck
The boat is passing Alcatraz Island
Archie and the boys are standing at the rail, They used to think that escape from that prison was impossible
52A Same scene, different Sunday
Warren and the boys are standing at the rail
They used to think that escape from that prison was impossible
52B    52 We resume with Archie and the boys
52B Continued Yes, Dad
Warren told us that last week
Warren
Well, we could have gone somewhere else
didn't know you had been
(the youngest) We thought maybe you had never been, Dad
No - well, thanks, actually  haven't been before, Stevie
In fact, we don't call him Stevie anymore
Who doesn't
Mom thinks he's getting a little old for being called Stevie, in fact
called you Stevie two weeks ago -e we were all calling you Stevie two weeks ago --  was
Before that
Warren says that Alcatraz taught the world you can get out of anything if you want to bad enough
That's what Warren said, eh
Yes, Dad
53 The boys are watching Archie who is in that section of the boat where the radar and electronic equipment are kept
Archie is on the ship telephone
He is trying to keep a straight face but since he is obviously talking to Petulia, it is difficult
a  : (to another kid) Doctors can do things like that
Call their patients from wherever they are
Archie finishes the call and returns to them, smiling
52 53 How about clams on the wharf when we get back
Clams make Steve vomit
Oh
You forgot that
No, it just slipped my mind
Archie really does like his kids but his thoughts are somewhere else
54 While Mike and Stevie are gorging themselves, Archie is at the wall telephone
a Hello there
55 During this silent scene we watch Oliver seduce Petulia into giving him a lift in her convertible
Petulia is so bored as the cars take hours to get past the gate, Oliver is an absolute scoundrel
David is such a clod, passing out in the back seat, his legs hanging out over the door of the car, one sandal missing
His beautiful face is somehow an obscene parody of itself, fiery red from the sun
Oliver mimics David, Petulia, the guard at the gate, dances, skips, romps, annoys Petulia, makes her laugh, dares her, goads her
Finally, when Petulia's car is just one away from the border guard, Oliver impudently hops into the seat beside her, expecting to be thrown out but also expecting maybe a nickel in the bargain
But the joke's on Oliver
Petulia is even kookier than he is
Is it the look of David that sickens her
Is it her annoyance at having to wait so long and do the driving while he lies collapsed and useless
Is it that "useless" that goads her
53 55 Most of all Petulia is doing something of absolutely no importance; she knows Oliver will hop out of the car the moment they reach the guard
All it amounts to is two kooks having a few seconds of horsing around
The joke is on both of them -- the guard, harassed by the honking of thousands of cars and having fully inspected the car just ahead of Petulia, waves the convertible on through
Petulia stops the car a few hundred yards past the border to let Oliver climb out, but he just sits there
Petulia thinks, "okay, you little bastard
" and zooms down the highway, intending to stop at the first moment the look of superior arrogance leaves Oliver's tough little face
During this we hear Archie and Petulia's second tele- phone conversation which is as blab and loving as before
: Hi, there
: Hello
: 'm having lunch with the boys
: You eat a good lunch, Archie, :  will,  will
: You only had a cup of coffee for breakfast
: 'll eat a good lunch, Petulia
: Like what
: Petulia, they have a thousand different things on the menu
: You should have a sirloin steak with french fries or baked beans
: Okay
: That's easy to say, Archie, But  know you
: Steak with french fries or baked beans
: Do they have fresh sea-food
: Yes
: Sea bass is nice
: Yes, sea bass is great
: If they grill it, : 'll have grilled sea bass
: Unless they do a nice omelet
: 'm sure they would if  asked
: It's such a problem
: Yes,  know
Goodbye, Petulia
: Phone
56 Archie laughingly hangs up
He goes back to his kids
54 0 57 The sign says all the dreadful penalty of being caught in the fort
Archie takes the boys in
Warren take you here
No
He would see the sign, eh
See 57A The boys whoop off up some stairs
Hey, this is great
Archie chases them through the floors
Archie sees a telephone above which is a sign which says that this phone is for the military and is to be used only in emergency
Archie approaches it warily, then loses his nerve and turns back to his kids
Archie wants to get back to Petulia
58 Alright
The boys look at him uncertainly
() Its ten to two
Can you imagine that
The time really went The boys know that means he wants to take them home
() 'm really bushed
() feel okay
Stevie is willing to let his dad off the hook
been sneezing
55 58 So  noticed
He's always sneezing
Hey, next week  want you guys over for the entire weekend
None of this three or four hour stuff
All weekend
Why not
To do what
You 'gust wait
Stevie is instantly excited, a Something really interesting
Bet your life'
What
Just leave it to melt Warren said something about the Roller Derby
Oh
Friday night till late Sunday
Unless you guys don't want to
The Roller Derby's pretty darn interesting
Yeah
56 58 We'd have to sleep over
mean if we were going to spend the whole weekend
want you to
() Well, it's fine by me
Me toot Boy l Okay, it's a dealt Mike turns away
He's going to cry  guess -- he does that
59
' Archie has had a pretty good day with the boys, is thinking a about Petulia waiting in his apartment, and feels pretty damn good about the whole thing
He opens the door of his apartment
He is carrying a bag of Mexican paper flowers 60 It is empty
Archie knows at once that Petulia is gone
All the joy goes out of him
The apartment is a mess
The television set is on: a program without sound of soldiers fighting
Archie is so disappointed that Petulia isn't here
He angrily flips the dial getting the same type of program
nice, neat kid
After all the exuberance he feels so empty
Everywhere things are scattered about
61 The bedroom is the worst of all
The sheets and blanket have literally been stripped from the bed and flung pall mall onto the floor behind
Archie really is annoyed
Then he stops, he crosses slowly to the tangle of sheets and blanket on the floor
lifeless arm protrudes
Archie crumples to his knees and tears at the blankets
Petulia is broken, bloodied and seemingly dead
57 61 Thi12-, phone is off the hook
Archie doesn't know where to turn first
He feels Petulia's throat for a pulse, isn't sure she has one, Petulia is wearing his hooded sweatshirt from Se
23
Archie attempts heart massage, but Petuliats so taped up from the broken rib that this is impossible
Archie presses his mouth over Petulia's to attempt to get her breathing again
He tries this only for an instant then crosses to the phone, hangs it up and dials an emergency number
Archie goes back to Petulia
He feels again for a pulse in her throat, can find no pulse
He begins trembling
As always when a crisis really happens, it isn't as easy as the Red Cross advertisements say
Her mouth won't open right
His mouth seems unable to make the connection with hers
It all looks more like very bad love-making than a life-saving procedure
62
/
&    ' Two special officers are moving Petulia down a hallway on a stretcher
third walks behind her pressing a rubber oxygen mask over her mouth
We feel Sunday late afternoon rudely shattered, but limp- ing along nevertheless
Television, cokes, sex, stereo, facials, isometric exercises
funny-papers, ailments; boring endless Sunday late afternoon -- suddenly bloodied
Doors are opening up and down the hallway
People come out to stare
big friendly old sheepdog wild with enthusiasm, leaps at the stretcher and almost topples Petulia
Archie, smeared with Petulia's blood, his shirt-tails out, in a state of shock himself, whams the dog as hard as he can
This entire sequence should seem like a nightmare
The dog's owner goes berserk
' Don't you hit Lennie
Archie is too distressed about Petulia to even respond
At every door there is a tenant
jumble of voices all spoken together
1ST 0 That's sex for you
2ND It could be a gas leak
58 62 0 3RD She's dead
4TH Those rescue cops never give up
5TH Yes'
but they're all racists
Of course, one of the officers is a Korean and the other a Negro
All through this we have also been aware of many sets, all with programs with various kinds of violence
One youbgster comes to the door holding a portable
and we see on the tube war casualties being flown out of the Jungle by helicopters
Archie has crossed ahead of the special officers to lead the way down the steps
Half a dozen "hippies"' loaded down with Chinese food and a yellow guitar are coming up the steps
Everything is chaos
The officers just can't manage the stretcher down the narrow stairway
Poor Petulia is twisted and turned every which way - all in the name of saving her life
7TH (a rich old queen in purple Bermuda shorts) had trouble like that with my piano
Two hundred dollars to bring it through the window
And its never been the same
record player is playing a Herb Alpert recording and the stretcher seems to move along to its rhythm
63 This is the stretch of highway 1 - 01 going north from
Mexico
The restaurant is a mass of neon, and does very well in,the hot coffee department as the sleepy travellers take a break on their way north
Among the cars many are filled with bull fight afficianados
It's about ten p
m
There is a general feeling of exhaustion and spent passions
People are bleary-eyed, recovering from hangovers, beginning to feel the effects of sunburns
All this we see later
First we see Oliver
Oliver is sitting in the car staring coldly at David who 0 has just awakened
David is probably just about to say "Who the hell are you" when Petulia appears carrying a cardboard carton of coffee and orange juice
59 63 David takes a sip of coffee
Oliver grabs at the orange juice, toppling it, spilling some of it on the seat but saving most
He gulps it down then uses the straw to make bubbles
David looks at Oliver and then at Petulia, all through the bubbles
Say hello to "Petulia"s Folly
" David says nothing
Oh
(with careful wit) If, in the past, you thought me a bit odd, feast your eyes on this little goodie
WhatAs the problem
(to Oliver) Why can't you speak English
(to David) Why the hell don't they teach them English
This little hustler picked me up in Tijuana -- (to Oliver, very gently) What's your name
've got a name for him
Oliver doesn't understand what is being said, but he is getting uneasy
Lady say "hey come on us go San Francisco ten bucks
" You bleeding little liar
Oliver looks at Petulia innocently
() never did
She's worried about David
60 0 63 What  said to this malicious little fink was that maybe one day if we went back to Tijuana -- (to Oliver) San Francisco
San Francisco
Each says it in his own accent, and so begins a word game
() San Francisco
{ ) San Francisco
Okay
"San Francisco
" 0 He pronounces it like Oliver
David doesn't answer her
(to Oliver) What's your name
(in bad Spanish) What are you called
(pronouncing it Spanish) Oliver
(pronouncing it English) Oliver
(pronouncing it Spanish) Oliver
They begin laughing again
Petulia is becoming t
completely unnerved
61 0 63 David
The San Diego bus is due at twelve fifteen
've already bought him a ticket
We've got to get this on tape
He's really something else'
get a real kick out of him
(imitating Oliver) "San Francisco
" Unless he's a midget
Hey, sure
Oliver is a sixty-three-year-old midgets Oliver grins, not understanding but feeling he has an ally
(to Petulia) Get in
It's still a long drive
We'll never get home
Okay
He can wait inside
The cashier's a sweet old dear
'll have him keep an eye on the ckeeky little bugger
0 She opens the car door to take Oliver out, tense, wanting to get past this moment but fearful that she won't
You promised "Oliver" "San Francisco
" did not
Like hell you didn't'
David abruptly hops over the seat and sits behind the wheel
He signals for Petulia to get in beside Oliver
Petulia hesitates
dig, bitch,  dig
She's stunned
His hand reaches out and brutally jerks her into the car
dig
on Petulia's frightened face
Now suddenly 0 the face has a tube in the nose; there's another tube in her throat; and she's unconscious
62 0 6L Half a dozen people are working to keep Petulia alive
They're used to their work, it's no big deal for them
Actually the feeling should be that they're as relaxed as if they were mechanics working on a motor car
Archie sits on a white stool in a corner, watching everything, not as a doctor any more but as a"deeply involved man
When one of the doctors hits a vein by mistake and murmurs "Whoops
" Archie can take no more and leaves
65
' Archie sits on a little stone shelf, just letting the water from the shower hit him
' Hey you
Barney is looking over the shower door at Archie with a mixture of concern and anger
(shouting over sound of shower) 0 Did you know there's a policeman outside wanting to talk to you
Archie nods dully
What the hell is going on
Archie nods dully
Can you have dinner with us tonight
Archie nods dully
66
'   ( ) Barney is working the film projector showing slides of a recent holiday with Wilma and their daughter
Each slide projects an enormous colored image against an entire wall
Archie is slumped on a couch popping peanuts into his mouth
You like this new lens, Archie
Is this the greatest lens you ever saw
63 66 Mrnmmmm
: () What am  supposed to do -- spend the money on belly dancers
i Wilma enters from another room
She's exhausted, (to Barney) Ask me what your daughter put in her steam inhalator, don't want to know, Ask
me, Cottage cheese, Actually 'm relieved, (to Archie) 'm afraid she's madly in love with your Stevie, ( Steven
Wilma looks at the pictures on the wall, Wasn't that a gorgeous week
just adore Big Sur
It rained every day
You kept insisting you were pregnant, (to Archie) You must take Polo and the boys -- She stops embarrassed, Wilma-The-Magic-Talking-Machine
Put a dime in and she talks all night
64 66 0 'm sorry Archie
Forget it
(she might cry) just can't think of you without thinking of Polo
Archie nods
() Had to drive Made me run a frog test on her
forty miles in the rain
Almost hit a truck
Could have been dead and buried three years
Through this Barney keeps changing slides
Suddenly there is a picture of Archie, Polo and Wilma on another vacation
In this slide they are posing in corny -shirts
The -shirts say, "Kiss me you fool" and " love the Rolling Stones"
, etc
Oh, hey, 'm sorry
Wilma looks very superior
'll bet he's sorry
There's nothing wrong with a little old-fashioned nostalgia
Do you remember that crazy Labour Day weekend we drove to Tahoe
(too quickly) 've got them right her Archie frowns at Wilma and Barney
But they are clumsy and obvious, and he is somewhat touched
keep everything
They just happen to be here
What do you think this is, a conspiracy
6; 66 Yes, Really they are all good friends, and they laugh good- naturedly, Let's see them Archie
Barney starts showing different slides of the Tahoe vacation
Archie watches scratching his ear, and eating peanuts
Wilma looks like the tears are about to start, child cries "Mommy
" (to Barney) You go this time
Barney goes, leaving the slide still showing on the wall
Wilma looks at Archie for a long moment
() a Wilma what do you want me to say
They were great old times, Archie what's happening to you
Nothing
Dontt say nothing -- the policeman even called here
Itm sorry
've had a splitting earache all day
Friends have certain rights, even the right to be obnoxious
Do you love this woman
Archie shrugs
i Well you must feel something
Yeah  guess so
Pity
66 66 0 Pity
Go to the dog pound
You'll find two hundred dogs ready to be gassed
Policemen
Then Wilma sighs
Shall  tell you something
wish had your guts
67 Archie is in Petulia's little cubicle slumped on a chair, sound asleep
Petulia lies on the bed, tubes protruding from arms and neck
She is still unconscious
Archie is awakened by a nun entering the cubicle to hook up another pint of blood
Archie's presence disconcerts the nun
She can't show her annoyance openly, but is so disturbed she does her work badly this time
Who would do such a thing to a girl like this
She's a child
Is there an orthopaedic problem, Dr
Bollen
Archie doesn't answer
doctor should get his sleep
You left the needle in
The nun would like to scream at Archie about the impropriety of his presence here but she can't
She is proud of the bottle of blood
From the Archbishop's Fund
Take the needle out
67 67 0 All races and creeds
Why hasn't her husband been notified
suppose they've tried
It would be such a nice surprise to have his picture here when she finally awakens
Wouldn't that be nice
Yes, It would give her some small comfort, would put a bit more tape around the needle, mentioned her this morning in the chapel
mention all my criticals
a In the future be more careful of the needle
She hardly makes a bump under the sheets
She leaves
Archie moves closer to Petulia examining her throat and eyes for vital signs
He pushes open an eyelid and Petulia's dead eye stares glassily into his living face
68 We spend awhile watching Archie function as a doctor, moving through the wards, examining broken legs, arms, or whatever
In one of these scenes we pass through the orthopaedic room
69 Oliver is being given therapy in a whirling bath
He's only one of some twenty patients and Archie barely notices him, simply waving to him as he does to other patients who don't need his care anymore
Oliver is too frightened of the whirling bath to give a damn about the doctor
Archie goes and we stay with Oliver
68 69 ' Come on, come on, get on with it
70 Three weeks ago
Oliver is wide awake, wolfing down a loaf
of bread that he has stolen from the Danner kitchen
As he gnaws on the bread, he listens to indistinct sounds from the master bedroom
moans and groans, a sudden cry, all of which he supposes are the sounds of love-making
He grins to himself in the dark
Abruptly a door opens and Petulia is coming down the hall
She has hastily put on a pair of slacks and a blouse, and is struggling into a coat
Her hair is tousled, her face filled with anguish
71 Petulia is hurriedly taking the hurriedly dressed Oliver down the steps
He is protesting
Before they can reach the front door, the door of the master bedroom opens
David is standing there in his pyjama pants
Hey, "San Francisco"
He pronounces it like Oliver does
He comes down the steps, three at a time
He stops before the kid
() sure hope there's no hard feelings
Oliver understands none of this, and of course David knows this, but it doesn't stop him
It isn't a question of hospitality, want you to understand that
feel terrible
Dragging you all the way up to San Francisco and then not even showing you Fisherman's Wharf
Comprehend
Petulia goes into the living room to find the keys to the car
0 Hold it a minute
69 0 71A (to Oliver) What's the rushy Whereas the fire
He stoops down beside the boy and shows him a wrist watch
You've go to have some little memento
Right
David, for God's sakes The wrist watch is much too big for Oliver's skinny wrist so David starts to fasten it around Oliver's biceps
Even this is too skinny so David starts fastening it around Oliver's lower leg
Oliver has no idea what is happening, but his hustler's heart tells him he is being given something very valuable
Petulia is repelled
(to Oliver) You see the basic problem is we just don't have the room for all the folks my old lady invites for a visit
Were kinda short of room
'd give you the shirt off my back
'm West-Texas and proud of it
But start loading up the house with make-believe kids, plus every Tom, Dick and Harry whose one and only claim to fame is that he knows how to do "it" -- 72 Petulia begins sobbing, and trying to tug the boy toward the lift
Hands off
The watch won't fasten to the leg either
David tries to fit it around the boy's neck
David begins to cry
70 72 V1' It won't fit any place
Petulia somehow gets Oliver into the lift and pushes the button
which starts it moving upward
(calling up) don't want any hard feelings' It was nothing personals Hey, we'll look you up sometime; When we're down that way
, Have a real old-fashioned fiesta; We'll have a ball; "Oliver
" During the preceding speech we  to Petulia and Oliver, Oliver, infuriated at Petulia, defiantly shows her that he has David's watch in his fist
He give me
Petulia stares out toward the sea
Davis is still screaming atl
them, and his voice sounds so unlikely in all the splendor of morning coming to San Francisco
73 , ' Archie is maneuvering his car out of his parking space when he sees the nun of the Intense Care Unit cross to another car driven by another nuns There are many cars with many nuns zooming around, How's your patient
Oh, Mrs
Danner
Mrs
Danner
How's Mrs
Danner
She woke up awhile ago
She woke up
Should
have called you`d Archie starts out of the car
71 73 She's asleep now
'm, to buy her blue Cornflowers and a hairbrush
Sister Teresa phoned the police
Prayers help, Dr
Bollena She asked for Mr
Danner
hope there's no orthopedic problem
But really she's not all that bad, this nun, mostly she believes that the sanctity of marriage happens to be true
She is not unmoved by the look of exhaustion on Archie's face
Blue Cornflowers
They exchange a smile
'm'also to go all the way across town and deliver a message to the Mendoza family, 'm to tell them everything is okay
And give them this
Let me
He takes the envelope on which the address has been written
7 This is the house in which Oliver is boarding
Now, as Archie drives up, there is no sign of anybody
Archie crosses to the door, puzzled
He knocks on the door but there is no answer
He goes around to the back
There's an old car without wheels, butane tanks, other junk but no sign of life
Archie knocks on the back door and finally the door is opened
Beyond the screen door is the Mexican we have seen earlier
He has been awakened from sleep and is annoyed
Mr
Mendoza
Mendoza yawns sleepily
'm Dr
Bollen
Do you know Mrs
Danner
Petulia Danner
No hablo ingles
Lo siento
72 74
Continued Petulia Danner
She gave me this address, The Mexican shakes his head in complete indifference, is already thinking about going back to sleep, and starts closing the door, She was beaten
Almost to death
Are you Mr
Mendoza
"Mendoza," si, (giving envelope) This is for you, Gracia
He starts to open the envelope
It contains a twenty dollar bill, Can  talk to you for a minute
Mendoza, with no idea what Archie is saying, starts closing the door and pocketing the money
He pounds on the door
The door opens
The Mexican says in : (in Spanish) work all night
Go away
He closes the door
Archie pounds on the door again
He hurts his hand
He sucks on the slight wound
He kicks at the door
He crosses around to the front of the house, negro and a white teenager are passing
Do either of you fellows speak Spanish
a speak a lot of Polish, if it would be any help, sir
73 a 74 Continued 've got to talk with this man in here
woman was almost beaten to death
Here
Not here
You said here, Almost, but not quite to death, sir
Yes
Here but not quite here
Listen, just find a cop, huh; a He'd better speak Polish, sir
'm on a fantastic Polish kick
The two chase each other down the street yelling "Da:" and "Paderewskii" and even "Yawohl;", etc, Archie looks at the house and then at his car and then at his bruised hand
He's furiousaz  police car passes'
Archie looks, but somehow can't bring himself to hail it
He wonders why he let the police car pass
He goes back to his car, 75 Archie moves swiftly to the screened cubicle that held Petulia
He goes inside
He stops short
An old man lies in the bed with a rubber stop in his mouth to keep him from swallowing his tongue until he regains consciousness
His false teeth lie on the table beside him
Archie is plunged deeper into the sense of the unreal
76 Petulia is in a two-bedded room
She has blue Cornflowers and a hairbrush
She is conscious now but looks quite wan
In the next bed is a middle-aged lady looking at
Petulia sees Archie
7
a 76 Continued Why weren't you there when  woke up
You better not say you were when the bill comes, Dr
Bollen
Who is this guy, Mendoza
Why am always finding you in a different bed
What are you
Avery sick girl
Who beat you up
What happened to your hand
Nothing happened to my hand
love your hands

Bookends
Did David beat you up
Was it Mendoza
Why did you send him money
'm still very sick
don't care
This man is a doctor
The world's best, madame The patient turns her back on the two of them
Petulia,you're turning me into a nut
Why hasn't David been here
Ask me questions
Petulia, is it possible for you to tell the truth about anything
() so Mendoza was looking after Oliver for nae She" s our cleaning lady s There was no Mrs o Mendoza ' drowsily) had to have some place for him to stay,, David would never have let e bring him home Bring who home
Iqm beginning to hurt
Petuliag  don't understand the kind of world you live ina Come on
For Ghri
st$s sake, a pretty young gi
rl9 what the hell is going on, who would lay a hand on you, how could you get so screwed up
Through this Petulia simply lies there, just looking a Archie
cans t stand it
Irm asleep
They gave me a pill
and ' asleep,, Really0  am really very sleepy,, Can we talk later, Archie
When ivm asleep kiss my forehead
She closes her eyes and sleeps
Archie gives her fore- head a kiss and she giggles
He leaves
4/26/67 75AA 77
Furniture Is pushed back and three pup tents circle the center of the room
Archie and his sons have been having a camp-in
They are all dressed in jeans and sweat shirts and Stevie even wears moccasins - as though they were in the:High Sierras
The remainders of
dinners are scattered around plus
Coke bottles plus their bed rolls from last night
Actually though it :rust: have sounded
like a great idea the two bogs are very bored, Archie,,: though trying to be "with-it' is far away,, and they sense it
Shouldn't we police the area
Good idea
Police the area
This is keen, Dad
Water canteens and everything
'm out of water
76 77 Always make sure you've got water
You'll find some in the kitchen
What's on
''m hot
In fact
Switch the fire off then
Stevie goes to switch the electric fireplace off
It's really keen, Dad
The bell rings and Polo is standing there, She looks around, smiling
' don't believe it
Even canteens, Mom
0 Polo really only has eyes for Archie
She is troubled by how haggard and worn he looks
Roller Derby starts at eight
We have to police the area
It's really been keen, Mom
Nobody ever heard of a
camp-in
The two boys now busy themselves with straightening out the place as Polo crosses to-Archie, It's been really keen, Mom
Poor Archie
Not "dumb" Archie
77 77 Never
The brightest
used to have such terrible anxiety that  would die suddenly
Before  could say thank you, Archie is very touched
have to go to
the latrine
Stevie goes
Is Dad allowed to come to the Roller Derby
mean since Uncle Warren couldn't
He is so bad at matchmaking that Polo and Archie can hardly keep a straight face
78 The place is almost empty, but the, fans are wildly enthusiastic and are placed to look ;like thousands for the camera
The women's team is on the rink, skating, 0 banging into each other with great good-natured brutality, One of the skaters bucks another clear off the rink, smashing through the rail
The kids are in heaven, but Polo is so shocked she instinc- tively turns-to Archie and buries her face in his shoulder
Out of habit, he lets her, even touching the back of her' head' comfortingly, assuring her no fatality has occurred
Mike, the ace matchmaker, watches them with satisfaction
() Don't let'that old fat butt get awa with tat; () ; (to Archie) Will you please tell
your son -- 78 78 She turns to 4rchie and sees him watching the fighting intently
The women are really brutal with each other
One small blonde lady is being, pummelled unmercifully by several others
As her head twists and turns from the forest of fists she seems to become Petulia
want to go home
They don't mean it
want some popcorn
'll get it
He rises quickly and moves to the refreshment counter behind the grandstand
Archie finds a telephone booth
Polo watches him at the a phone booth
Her eyes lose their warmth
The women's team races around the track
Archie returns with a box of Cracker Jacks
said popcorn
() How is she
Dead  hope
Archie is stunned at Polo's abrupt coldness
You don't even know her
() just have to look at you
,Archie stops, remembering this is approximately what Petulia had said about Polo
He does a "how odd:" without saying it
79 78 She's not going to die
What a shame
She has her first visitor
Mr
Danner
Polo couldn't care less
Five skaters smash into each other on the rink but Polo doesn't flinch
She wouldn't think of turning to Archie for comfort
"His Mastahs in'Hydraul:ics
" They sit coldly wit4 their children, a million miles apart
79
' The Mr
Danner who is with Petulia is David's father
Petulia lies in the bed staring straight ahead at an enormous cotton giraffe, obviously a gift
The patient in the next bed has three middle-aged girl friends visiting her
They are playing bridge
Their presence frustrates Mr
a Danner
The other patient's
set is on, and on the tube" we barely notice the continued violence of the outside world
It's been a terrible shock to us
to Mother and me,
Our sailor boy and his pretty bride
79A
' He stands at a great eye of a window
Mother Danner is mournfully quartering apples for an apple pie
' As  told Mother, "the values we lived by just don't seem to mean anything at all anymore
Our kids can chuck out two thousand years of Western civilization of Christianity
as though it wasn't worth a red cent
' 80 0 79B
' , () must say Mother's answer surprised and, well, really sort of tickled me: "It's easy to be an angel when you're old and worn out and nobody wants you anymore," You see we do try, Petulia
mean there you were in that man's apartment
Where  come from
in "little pockets of ignorance"  suppose you'd call it
you'll find people who still live by the unwritten law
790
' There's still many a county courthouse where the husband could kill both parties and not spend one night in jail, We hear  of a bell ringing incessantly in short bursts
79D
' The bell is still ringing signifying the end of visiting hours and the other patient's visitors sigh, put the playing cards together and prepare to leave
Mr
Danner makes no move to leave, In the hospital of my dreams people won't be chased out like sheep
People are better than most of the medicines they give you
David has finally'got around to repairing that wharf
He hired a couple of boys
The three of them are really working up a sweat
He's thinking of sailing all the way down the coast to Lima
That's in Peru
All through this there's no response whatever from Petulia
Her eyes are fixed on the eyes of the giraffe
They say Lima is a terrific city
If you watch out for flies and take sensible sanitary precautions
'll tell you a secret but don't you snitch: 'm using propaganda on David so that the four of 0 us can go
Mother's a better sailor than am
Even though  served eighteen months on a mine sweeper
Which should have prepared me for anything
81 79D Continued nun looks in
() Visiting hours are over
(taking his turmoil out on the nun) had lunch with your Mr
Pearl less than two weeks ago; The nun looks blank
Mr
Pearl happens to be the superintendent of this Hospital; Two weeks ago at the Blue Fox Restaurants Just the six of usl The nun shrugs and leaves
Mr
Danner is really trembling now from his controlled emotion
Petulia will not take her eyes from the giraffe
The patient in the next bed is grumbling something about "what's sauce for the goose should be' sauce for the gander", etc
Mr
Danner abruptly takes a a small leather bound photograph from his pocket
It's the wedding picture of Petulia and David
Without a word he puts it on the night stand
Petulia will not look at it
79E The end of Sc
72 is very quickly replayed
80 During Sc
79E and 80 we continue to hear Mr
Danner:
Its a tiny bus station and hardly anyone is around this time of mo'rnin'g
Petulia waits with Oliver who is very annoyed at what has been done to him
few other early travelers are about
- As the bus comes into sight, Oliver, grasping his last chance of freedom, suddenly darts away we see Oliver; hit by a car; the look of agony on Petuliaa's face; the reaction of the spectators; and finally the ultimate image: the boy pinned under the wheel
' (during preceding scene) David and  went at it hot and heavy
About the value of psychiatry
mean sensible psychiatry
None of that "Sex- is-the-reason-for-everything" junk
It won't ever replace a visit to the wood- shed and a good whack across the backside, but its late in the old ball game for that
82 81  7-1 o ' a The nun reappears
'm sorry Sir, but it's time for the lady's medication
Does anyone ever report how filthy this room is
He loses all his aplomb, He squats, he points, he finds imaginary objects on the floor
, Look at this'
Look at this personally raised fifty thousand dollars for this Hospital during the last campaign
You didn't know that did you; Well ask Mr, Pearl'
mean if you knew what he looked like'
Filthy'
He gets up to go, The nun leaves, Mr
Danner brushes imaginary dust from his knees
He's perspiring, dis- hevelled, and still hasnAt said what he came to say
He waits there a moment more, Finally in a flat voice 40 without even looking at him: Tell David, it's alright
He can come out of the cupboard
The old man almost sobs
Instead he exclaims in a jolly voice
Chin up'
81A This time we are with the
, and we are looking through his scanner
We see all the excited people, but among them sit Archie and Polo, as cold as death
Suddenly, on the scanner, we see Polo rise and begin to leave tugging the two boys along with her, Archie makes no move to stop them
82 Archie wearing his white doctor's smock enters Petulia's room
83 83 The'bed where the second patient lay is empty
In Petulia's bed is the withered old man who earlier had taken Petulia's place in the Intense Care Unit
He's quite chipper now but is in many splints and braces
'm not sick
Don't waste time on me
Archie turns to face the nun in attendance
Where is she
Mrs
Danner
They picked her up
Dr
Worthington said it was alright so long as she had proper nursing
Who picked her up
Her husband  suppose
They had a long talk with Dr
Worthington
He seemed entirely satisfied
They kidnapped hero He hurries down the hall
The'nun is startled
Take care of the sick people
'm in tip-top shape
81E Archie hops off the lift as it reaches the bottom of the cliff
At the front of the house we see David and two colored men at work on the wharf
At the wharf is the yacht
Archie racies up to the nearest door and begins ringing the bell
85 Petulia couldn't be lovelier, or happier
She's in a special hospital bed
There are flowers everywhere
She has her own colour
set which is silently showing scenes of violence
An efficient nurse is in attendance
84 85 0 The nurse is sitting at the foot of the bed, and Petulia is brushing the nurse's hair
Archie stands in the doorway overwhelmed at the normality of it all
Obviously Petulia has fixed her hair too
Hi Archie
Dazedly Archie crosses to the night stand where there is a pitcher of tomato juice
Because he has nothing else to do he sniffs the tomato juice, (to nurse) This is Dr
Bollen of the Hospital
He's a splendid doctor, (to Archie) This is Agnes Lillywhite
Our young lady is doing nicely
We have a few problems, but nothing serious
a  get hiccups
`  go along merrily hiccupping for hours on end
Why did you leave the hospital
was feeling ever so much better, Archie
Mrs
Danner looks in
She is wearing an apron and stirring a batch of something
Will you be staying for lunch, sir
Goodness knows there's plenty of meatloaf
She goes and David enters
He looks extremely handsome
He wears white duck pants and a slip-over sweater
And a happy-go-lucky grin
You two haven't met
(to David) This is Dr
Bollen
85 85 () Yes,  thought so
Hello, there
David sees that Archie has no intention of shaking his hand, so he crosses to the bed and begins to playfully Drank Petulia up and down
(to Petulia) want you to go back to the hospital
Dr
Worthington says she's doing fine
He's going to make daily house calls
He's very good about that
Petulia _mA
During this Mr
Danner has entered
He is really the only one not good at the charade
() Well, you're finally meeting our whole family
Dr
Bollen,  wouldn't exactly call this good taste
Not to mention medical ethics
Dad, you old fuddy-duddy, things happen
Archie suspects he is having a nightmare
With the exception of Mr
Danner, he has never seen so many cheerful people in one place
(to Petulia) You told the policeman you had a dizzy spell
Right
fell on my bottom
86 85 0 You were beaten up
You were somebody's punching bag
won't have you cross-examining this girl
Your son nearly killed this girl
() Hey now listen, doe, 'll stand still for only so much
(to the nurse) want you to remember what this man just said
(to Archie) Though it's none of your business, my boy was in Baton Rouge, Louisiana
Looking at boats
We've decided we're quite happy with the one we have
When Dad phoned me  was having dinner with a cousin of ours
Real mouth- watering Creole cooking
He and Petulia chuckle at each other as though this were some kind of private joke
Archie crosses to Petulia and just stands there looking at her
He doesn't know what to do
() 'm fine Archie
Except  burp a lot
Everybody gets dizzy spells
Archie looks incredulously from Petulia who has resumed brushing the nurse's hair; to David; to Mr
Danner who's obviously annoyed at Archie's bad taste; to Mrs
Danner who is in the dining room setting up an extra place for Archie
What can he do
Abruptly he rushes from the house
87 86 Archie runs toward the lift that will move him up the cliff
He can't get away fast enough
He climbs into the lift and pushes the button
The lift begins moving, but too slowly for him
He hops off the lift and begins scrambling up the side of the cliff
87
' Petulia looks out the window and sees Archie scrambling up the cliff, She fits a curler into the nurse's hair
' Going back to the house was the only thing  could do
scenes 87A
,and  occur only in Petulia's mind
87A Petulia is waiting for Archie at the top of the cliff as he staggers toward her
Since everything is taking place in her mind, this is how Petulia really is
() Where else could  go
lonely hotel room
don't have a penny of my own
Mr
Danner promised me 'd never be left alone
thought 'd try it for a few days
Don't be-angry
It was nobody's fault
Actually, if anyone is to blame, it's you, Archie
() Me
o 87B Petulia now recreates the moment when she first met Archie
Archie is searching through his pockets for the ticket to reclaim his coat, Petulia rushes up to him, with none of the fake nonsense of the actual meeting, but with absolute desperation
Archie is dressed as he is on the hill (Scene 86)
'm Petulia Danner
save me like you saved Oliver
save me from David
Don't lust scramble up the hill like a a b oody fool o 88 87B Continued Archie is stunned
'm looking for the ticket for my raincoat
87C
' From her bedroom window Petulia watches Archie scramble up the hill
' Coming for me in that pokey little car
87D In Petulia's mind, a great white ambulance is moving majestically through towering trees, carrying Petulia to safety
' () 9 Why didn't you bring a proper ambulance
As though you really meant it
' didn't know what to do
was going from one moment to the next
' Spectacular entrance, lousy exit
Sounds familiar, Archie
Suddenly all the anger goes out of Petulia
' : No, it's not your fault
87E Petulia dismisses the ambulance from her mind because she has something very serious to say to Archie
She is with him on the rocks below the bridge
went back to the house because  owed it to David
have a brown thumb when it comes to men
put them on the Cross and call them Jesus
And there they hang don't know why  do it
Not because of any high opinion of myself
oh, Archie, if you only knew
89 87E Continued She looks up at the bridge and instantly creates David standing there
An incredibly heroic figure in a white blazer and turtle neck sweater
Yet somehow we must sense that despite how grand David looks, at any moment in Petulia's mind he may leap to his death
Look at him
Isn't he super
six foot three Coca Cola bottle
Empty
did that
'd ruin you, Archie
87F We are now back in visual reality with Petulia, and the playful David who is trying to make Petulia laugh, which she does
' David was the gentlest man  ever knew
88 Archie has neared the top of the cliff
His pants are ripped, his hands are scraped, he is gasping in anguish
' 'd ruin you
In five weeks, 'd be running around with a black eye
By now, Archie has reached the top of the cliff and is a complete mess
He turns for one last look at the Danner house and the yacht beyond
He shakes his fist maniacally
89 EXT0 During the following    Archie is trying to get back to normality
He's having a nice sensible talk with Warren Smith, Polo's fiance
It is a pleasant sunny day and a group of Indian boys are being told about the forest by an Irish guide
In the background Archie's two children are playing with Warren's child
It's never too soon to think of the boys' education
Warren winks at him knowingly
Have you thought of doing something about that
90 89 What
; ; ^ ^ i12i12i12,, That twi Lch v v d
What twitch
don't have a twitch
You do
Come and see me
Don't touch it, it'll give you a phobia
'll fix it for free
Thanks,  will
You know,  like you more t han  ever thought  would
Warren, you're a beautiful human being
They turn to watch the boys at play
Nearby, the guide is explaining something to the Indians
What happens next
Spring
Archie smiles hoeefully
90 Beyond is the entire shockingly beautiful panorama of San Francisco
Archie and May are having champagne cocktails
They clink glasses and look at each other through candlelight
Archie spills some of his cock- tail but May doesn't spill a drop
Archie smiles hopefully
91 Archie dances with many girls, some hippies, some chic, all terribly young and unsmiling
Archie smiles hopefully
92
SA111' For the first    Archie is not smiling
He _L z ri g at Petulia
Archie and his boys are riding on ou side of a cable car
The car has stopped at the t p of the hill as has the car going the other way
in the other car is Petulia by herself
Petulia waves f
rst
Archie waves back
Petulia has shopping parcels
You look better
Feel marvelous
Michael and Stevie
Archie nods, We
-re going to see the penguins
Everything okay with your Oh yes, fine
The cars start down their separate ways
93 Thirty penguins march around the rim of their pool to the music of Pomp and Circumstance
Through the Public Address System, a voice explains that the penguins represent all nations and are gathered 'here for their own Olympics which they originated two million years ago, when penguins were nine feet tall and great athletes
Archie senses someone staring at him, turns and sees Petulia sitting in the grandstand with her parcels
He tries to ignore her by concentrating on his kids, but he cannot
Actually, he doesn't want to ignore Petulia
He looks back, she is still there, smiling happily
Archie gestures for the boys to stay where they are, then starts toward Petulia
The penguins are now going through various acrobatics while the narrator is telling more about their exotic origins
Archie stumbles through laughing children, ruins a tourist's snapshot, etc
, until he finally reaches Petulia
Now one penguin is pushing another penguin in a baby carriage
Everyone thinks it's adorable
Archie sits beside Petulia not really knowing what to say
He hasn't decided whether to be angry that she has followed him,- or amused, or delighted -- or all three
92 0 93 Now the taped music is blaring a Loud marching song as the penguins lumberingly form into a Roman legion, The laughter,, music and applause
make any intimate conversa- tion almost impossible
But Petulia is waiting for Archie to say something
Archie sees that Mike has turned from the penguins to stare at his father accusingly
Mike won't stop staring
Mike now tries to make Stevie turn and look accusingly with him, Archie doesn't know what to do0 Finally, Petulia rises and gathers her parcels,, still quite pleasant
She drops a parcel and Archie retrieves it for hero Its from a sportswear shop,, colorful and gay
As Archie gives Petulia the parcel, she touches his hand, running her fingers lightly over his skin, thoughtful, as though wanting to remember something
Petulia moves quickly through people toward the exit
Archie almost calls her back, but there is too much noise
9
' Archie is returning from work, weighted down with books for his research, plus miscroscope
He sees his apartment door ajar
His heart stops
He kicks his door open with his foot, not daring to think who will be inside
95
' No, you're wrong
Its not Petulia
Two elderly gentlemen in spotless dungarees are just finishing installing a portable greenhouse in Arc hie's living room
The Mexican paper flowers have been carefully moved
Oh, oho We were supposed to be out of here before you came home, Dr
Bollen
So you'd think it came from Santa Claus, The two elderly gentlemen chuckle at Archie's puzzled look
93 95 Wonderful
i
sn g t - t
They sell like hot cakes
Gives you something alive in all this stone
There must be some mistake
He sags down on a chair, draped in his research books
The two old gentlemen couldn't be more pleased
Mac and  get a, big kick out of people's first reaction
Its not a toy
It's a working greenhouse
You control heat and humidity with these
(he indicates dials) You've got a little bit of everything
Ornamental plants,, Zinnias, Asters
Even a little vegetable garden
The most important thing to remember is to keep the sun out
These new kind of lights work so much better, there's no comparison
You've got the wrong apartment l () No we have not s Dr
Bollen3 What screwball Then he stops, He knows what screwball
No gift card
It might come by mail
Archie starts chuckling
He crosses to the green- house, still chuckling
9L
95 This one heat, and this one humidity, right
Exactly
We've left a manual of operations, and wetll check everything out in a month
Okay, Dr
Bollen
(still chuckling) Okay, okay
Goodbye,' He enters the greenhouse, having to stoop almost double, as the two old gentlemen exit from the apartment
96 Though extremely uncomfortable, Archie is entirely happy
Suddenly he is ripping up flowers and vegetables to make a kooky bouquet
He is positively exultant
He adds radishes and turnips to the bouquet
This is the happiest we have ever seen Archie
97 Archiets car is parked on the cliff
The Danner house is dark, deserted, abandoned
Archie is standing by himself on the wharf bouquet in hand
The yacht has gone
And so has Petulia
Archie feels utterly alone, and as a matter of fact, he is
He tosses the bouquet into the water
The lettuce floats
97A Theoretically, we should be at some flea bag port in South America
Mostly, we  the yacht
40 95 97A Continued Petulia is sunbathing on the yacht
She looks much better now
Weeks have passed, she has a golden tan
Beside her, a transistor radio has picked up a local broadcast which would be in either Spanish or Portuguese and which consists mostly of music
David hops onto the yacht carrying a bag of groceries
He, too, is deeply tanned, marvelously healthy, but somehow uneasy
Hi
Did you get mama on the plane all right
Sure
But what a dinky plane
Poor mamats stomach problems are far from over
He enters the cabin
Petulia sits up after a moment, looks about, sees no one else, then then in alarm peers into one of the windows that looks down into the cabin
97B David is stowing food into the refrigerator
You didn't leave papa alone in that horrible little town
It's not such a horrible little town
(he holds up a can) Hearts of artichokes' () David
Take your "Vitamer Zed," you blinkint Limey
96 0 97B Continued He uses the English way of saying "vitamin," and then a bit too rakishly he tosses an orange up through the window
Instinctively, Petulia makes an effort to catch, misses, and it hits her lightly on the shoulder
Though it causes no damage,'David is suddenly in terror
He races up out of the cabin to Petulia
97C David rushes to Petulia
Of course the orange did no damage whatever, but there is an abrupt tension between them
He flops down beside her and begins peeling the orange, Papa went with her at the last minute
Petulia , shocked
() She was so pale and seared
They aren't even pressurized
The plane
You suck on a tube and hope it's oxygen
During this he has peeled the orange and torn it into segments, which he now tries to feed her
Open
How could he have gone
Just like that
Where mama is concerned, papa is a very loving man
Open
Instead, Petulia jumps frightened to her feet, She seems about to leave the yacht
Please don't
He Dromised; Honey
It'll be okay, Cross my heart
0 He promised
97 0 97C Continued middle-aged couple are passing by on their way to their luxurious yacht which is anchored close by
They are trailed by a rather tacky Mari-ache trio, Hello there you gorgeous people
Everyone's invited for Margueritas and cha-cha-cha
() Mr
and Mrs
Danner are gone, (a`s corny as this) Oooh la la; Lucky you; The group goes off, toward their yacht
Petulia doesn't know what to do
David skims off his jeans and jackknifes into the water
The sun glints on his exquisite body
Confusedly, Petulia pops a segment of an orange into her mouth
David surfaces from the water laughing up at her
He looks great
97D Petulia and David are returning from the other yacht
They are dressed casually, but very well
David is completely happy
Petulia is uneasy -- uneasy hell, she's frightened out of her wits
From the other yacht we still hear the of the Mariache trio and people squealing with delight David is humming along with the music
We didn't have to come back this early
You're still not one hundred per cent well
They've reached the cabin
He enters
She waits outside
Suddenly his hand is around her wrist, somewhat too hard, and in a gesture he hopes is playful, he pulls her down the steps into the cabin
97E Icy hands
Warm heart
98 97E Continued 10 So they say, Petulia says nothing
She begins undressing, () didn't tell papa to leave
She doesn't answer
() He only had the clothes on his back
She doesn't answer
() didn't
want him to leave
All right, David
a "All right, David," through chattering teeth
Petulia crawls under the sheet of a bunk
Only a crazy man hits a woman
Or a coward
won't ever again
'd stick my hand into a garbage disposal
would, Petulia
'd grind it up, Petulia lies under the sheet, silent, rigid, David abruptly crosses to a cabinet and takes out a signal flare pistol
He snaps in a flare and tosses it at Petulia
She sits up in panic
Hang on to it
If  come for you let me have a flare
Between the eyes
'll melt in ten seconds
Petulia is touched
99 97E Continued i12i12;IULi12iA couldn't do that, Youtre too beautiful to melt
(suddenly angry) Girls are beautiful, () So are centaurs, unicorns, minataurs,0
() , ,astron
uts, short order cooks, trumpet players,,, Cavalry officers, aging poets, men of science,,
They are enjoying the nonsense
Then on "Men of Science': 0 97F ' : His finger is pressed against the doorbell over which is the nameplate ",
" The door finally opens and Petulia is standing there in Archie's hooded sweatshirt
Her eyes widen in terror as David enters Archie's apartment
She knows he has come here to kill her, 97G The image ends
David is abruptly withdrawn, but Petulia is carried away by memory
The first time  saw you, you were being charming to- somebody who didn't buy a boat after all, You were wearing a light blue turtleneck sweater
Your sunglasses wAre'pushed up into your hair
You had sandals, but'-no socks
Trying
to sell a forty foot yacht without socks
had never seen anything so perfect
"He's not real
He's one of those plastic gadgets Americans do so well
Ah, but want one

iect ng 101 98 Then Petulia sees Archie beside her bed
He is wearing his hospital jacket which gives him the run of the place
They can't keep any secrets around here
When did you get back
year ago
You didn't forget me, How could
All those laughs
He dabs a Kleenex on her sweat-beaded face
So, Things go better with Mr
and Mrs
Danner, Obviously, They look at each other tenderly
Why did you let me get away
Bad timing
Dumb Archie
Girls like me are very rare, Archie Archie cannot endure this, () could
call an ambulance
Take you to a private hospital in Oakland
If we didn't make it in time, so what,  don't know how many babies  delivered as an intern
98A ' , 98B 40 There's nothing to it
Especially a girl with your pelvis, You've got a very superior pelvis
102 98B Continued She begins to ;ry
We'd never be apart again0 You don't mean it
do
Petulia twists in pain
The nurse looks over
That wasn't four minutes
The nurse makes a note then turns her attention to another lady who must be wheeled to the Delivery Room, hurt
Touch it Archie
Make it hurt less
His hand touches her belly very gently
0 It doesn't help
You see
But your hands were magic with Oliver
Who
Her pain has subsided, and she looks up at Archie
Would you really
Yes
You'd call an ambulance
At this late stage
Say the word
No
'm different now
Damn it Archie, why did  go to that Motel with you
103 98B Continued The pregnant ladies react to this
() Do you realize we were actually only a one night stand
We never even gave each other a cold, All we really did was pass each other going the other way
Have  changed you, Archie
You turned me into a nut
Is that good
Yes,  think so, Who knows
hope Archie, call the ambulance
Archie crosses to the phone, picks up the receiver, then almost at once he puts it down again
a When  lay dying -- twenty years from now -- a middle-aged old lady -- wondering what my life was all about, you won't even cross my mind
Archie winces
He starts out
He cantt even say goodbye
Hey, wait  lied
About what
'll never forget you, Arnold
Arnold
He starts laughing, then she starts laughing
He crosses to her and holds her hand in his very tightly
Then he leaves
10TH 99 Archie feels unexpectedly giddy and carefree
He meets David carrying a silly, sweet gift
David tenses for a show-down, Archie impulsively flips out David's tie and continues on his way, 100 EXT0 As Archie exits from the hospital a kid on a roller board almost kills him
He has an ice cream bar
He sees three pretty girls, one with blonde hair like Petulia's
But it's the dark-haired girl who feels his gaze and looks back
Archie, watching the girl, and eating his ice cream, leans against an electrical appliance shop window
Inside, among endless other items is a single
tube, on which the world's violence flickers silently and unnoticed as before
As we leave Archie, we feel a sense of euphoria -- well, what do you know, it all ended rather sweetly after all
101 Petulia is looking up at the bright light on the ceiling
Two hands move toward her face holding an ether mask
The hands seem infinitely gentle
One hand touches Petulia's face to reassure her
(in a whisper) Archie
