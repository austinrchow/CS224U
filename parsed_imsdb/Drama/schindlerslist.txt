As a hand comes down stamping a   across a registration card, there is absolute silence
then , the Hungarian love song, "Gloomy Sunday," distant
and the stripe bleeds into , into
- ,  - The song plays from a radio on a rust-stained sink
The light in the room is dismal, the furniture cheap
The curtains are faded, the wallpaper peeling
but the clothes laid out across the single bed are beautiful
The hands of a man button the shirt, belt the slacks
He slips into the double-breasted jacket, knots the silk tie, folds a handkerchief and tucks it into the jacket pocket, all with great deliberation
bureau
Some currency, cigarettes, liquor, passport
And an elaborate gold-on-black enamel Hakenkreuz (or swastika) which the gentleman pins to the lapel of his elegant dinner jacket
He steps back to consider his reflection in the mirror
He likes what he sees: Oskar Schindler -- salesman from Zwittau -- looking almost reputable in his one nice suit
Even in this awful room
- ,  - spotlight slicing across a crowded smoke-choked club to a small stage where a cabaret performer sings
Its September, 1939
General Sigmund List's armored divisions, driving north from the Sudetenland, have taken Cracow, and now, in this club, drinking, socializing, conducting business, is a strange clientele:  officers and Polish cops, gangsters and girls and entrepreneurs, thrown together by the circumstance of war
Oskar Schindler, drinking alone, slowly scans the room, the faces, stripping away all thats unimportant to him, settling only on details that are: the rank of this man, the higher rank of that one, money being slipped into a hand
in front of the  officer who took the money
lieutenant, hes at a table with his girlfriend and a lower-ranking officer
From the gentleman
The waiter is gesturing to a table across the room where Schindler, seemingly unaware of the  men, drinks with the best-looking woman in the place
Do  know him
His sergeant doesnt
His girlfriend doesn't
Find out who he is
The sergeant makes his way over to Schindler's table
There's a handshake and introductions before -- and the lieutenant, watching, can't believe it -- his guy accepts the chair Schindler's dragging over
The lieutenant waits, but his man doesn't come back; he's forgotten already he went there for a reason
Finally, and it irritates the  man, he has to get up and go over there
Stay here
His girlfriend watches him cross toward Schindler's table
Before he even arrives, Schindler is up and berating him for leaving his date way over there across the room, waving at the girl to come join them, motioning to waiter to slide some tables together
and another round of drinks
The lieutenant makes a halfhearted move for his wallet
Let me get this one
No, put it away, put it away
Schindler's already got his money out
Even as he's paying, his eyes are working the room, settling on a table where a girl is declining the advances of two more high-ranking men
as a waiter lays it down on another table that's been added to the others
Schindler seats the  officers on either side of his own "date" -- What are you drinking, gin
He motions to a waiter to refill the men's drinks, and, returning to the head of the table(s), sweeps the room again with his eyes
erupts from Schindler's party in the corner
Nobody's having a better time than those people over there
His guests have swelled to ten or twelve --  men, Polish cops, girls -- and he moves among them like the great entertainer he is, making sure everybody's got enough to eat and drink
Here, closer, at this table across the room, an  officer gestures to one of the  men who an hour ago couldn't get the girl to sit at his table
The guy comes over
1 Who is that
2 (like everyone knows) That's Oskar Schindler
He's an old friend of

screws in a flashbulb
She lifts the unwieldy thing to her face and focuses
As the bulb flashes, the noise of the club suddenly drops out, and the moment is caught in  and : Oskar Schindler, surrounded by his many new friends, smiling urbanely
-  - photograph of a face on a work card,  and typed name, black and white
hand affixes a sticker to the card and it saturates with ,
People in long lines, waiting
Others near idling trucks, waiting
Others against sides of buildings, waiting
Clerks with clipboards move through the crowds, calling out names
Groder
Gemeinerowa
Libeskind
-  - The party pin in his lapel catches the light in the hallway
Stern
Behind Schindler, the door to another apartment closes softly
radio, somewhere, is suddenly silenced
Are you Itzhak Stern
At the door of this apartment, a man with the face and manner of a Talmudic scholar, finally nods in resignation, like his number has just come up
am
Schindler offers a hand
Confused, Stern tentatively reaches for it, and finds his own grasped firmly
'  - Settled into an overstuffed chair in a simple apartment, Schindler pours a shot of cognac from a flask
There's a company you did the books for on Lipowa Street, made what, pots and pans
Stern stares at the cognac Schindler's offering him
He doesn't know who this man is, or what he wants
(pause) By law,  have to tell you, sir, 'm a Jew
Schindler looks puzzled, then shrugs, dismissing it
All right, you've done it -- good company, you think
He keeps holding out the drink
Stern declines it with a slow shake of his head
It did all right
Schindler nods, takes out a cigarette case
don't know anything about enamelware, do you
He offers Stern a cigarette
Stern declines again
was just the accountant
Simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think
Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you
Schindler lowers his voice as if there could possibly be someone else listening in somewhere
Field kits, mess kits
He waits for a reaction, and misinterprets Stern's silence for a lack of understanding
Army contracts
But Stern does understand
He understands too well
Schindler grins good-naturedly
Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune
Don't you think
(with an edge) think most people right now have other priorities
Schindler tries for a moment to imagine what they could possibly be
He can't
Like what
Stern smiles despite himself
The man's manner is so simple, so in contrast to his own and the complexities of being a Jew in occupied Cracow in 1939
He really doesn't know
Stern decides to end the conversation
Get the contracts and 'm sure you'll do very well
In fact the worse things get the better you'll do
It was a "pleasure
" The contracts
That's the easy part
Finding the money to buy the company, that's hard
He laughs loudly, uproariously
But then, just as abruptly as the laugh erupted, he's dead serious, all kidding aside -- You know anybody
Stern stares at him curiously, sitting there taking another sip of his cognac, placid as a large dog
Jews, yeah
Investors
(pause) Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale
Well, they wouldn't own it, 'd own it
'd pay them back in product
They can trade it on the black market, do whatever they want, everybody's happy
He shrugs; it sounds more than fair to him
But not to Stern
Pots and pans
(nodding) Something they can hold in their hands
Stern studies him
This man is nothing more than a salesman with a salesman's pitch; just dressed better than most
don't know anybody who'd be interested in that
(a slow knowing nod) They should be
Silence
- mason trowels mortar onto a brick
As he taps it into a place and scrapes off the excess cement, the image Under lights, a crew of brick-layers is erecting a ten-foot wall where a street once ran unimpeded
-  - young man emerges from an alley pocketing his Jewish armband
He crosses a street past German soldiers and trucks and climbs the steps of St
Mary's cathedral
'  - dark and cavernous place
priest performing Mass to scattered parishioners
Lots of empty pews
The young Polish Jew from the street, Poldek Pfefferberg, kneels, crosses himself, and slides in next to another young man, Goldberg, going over notes scribbled on a little pad inside a missal
Pfefferberg shows him a container of shoe polish he takes from his pocket
Whispered, bored -- What's that
You don't recognize it
Maybe that's because it's not what  asked for
You asked for shoe polish
My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army
But by the time it got there -- because of the cold -- it broke, the whole truckload
(pause) So 'm responsible for the weather
asked for metal, you gave me glass
This is not my problem
Look it up
Goldberg doesn't bother; he pockets his little notepad and intones a response to the priest's prayer, all but ignoring Pfefferberg
This is not your problem
Everybody wants to know who  got it from, and 'm going to tell them
Goldberg glances to Pfefferberg for the first time, and, greatly put upon, takes out his little notepad again and makes a notation in it
Metal
He flips the pad closed, pockets it, crosses himself as he gets up, and leaves
- Pfefferberg at the front desk of a sleepy hotel with another black market middleman, the desk clerk
Both are wearing their armbands
Pfefferberg underlines figures on a little notepad of his own -- Let's say this is what you give me
These are fees  have to pay some guys
This is my commission
This is what  bring you back in Occupation currency
The clerk, satisfied with the figures, is about to hand over to Pfefferberg some outlawed Polish notes from an envelope when Schindler comes in from the street
The clerk puts the money away, gets Schindler his room key, waits for him to leave so he can finish his business with Pfefferberg
but Schindler doesn't leave; he just keeps looking over at Pfefferberg's shirt, at the cuffs, the collar
That's a nice shirt
Pfefferberg nods, Yeah, thanks, and waits for Schindler to leave; but he doesn't
Nor does he appear to hear the short burst of muffled gunfire that erupts from somewhere up the street
You don't know where  could find a shirt like that
Pfefferberg knows he should say 'no,' let that be the end of it
It's not wise doing business with a German who could have you arrested for no reason whatsoever
But there's something guileless about it
Like this
(nodding) There's nothing in the stores
The clerk tries to discourage Pfefferberg from pursuing this transaction with just a look
Pfefferberg ignores it
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs
Nice things cost money
The clerk tries to tell Pfefferberg again with a look that this isn't smart
How many
don't know, ten or twelve
That's a good color
Dark blues, grays
Schindler takes out his money and begins peeling off bills, waiting for Pfefferberg to nod when it's enough
He's being overcharged, and he knows it, but Pfefferberg keeps pushing it, more
The look Schindler gives him lets him know that he's trying to hustle a hustler, but that, in this instance at least, he'll let it go
He hands over the money and Pfefferberg hands over his notepad
Write down your measurements
As he writes down the information, Pfefferberg glances to the desk clerk and offers a shrug
As he writes -- 'm going to need some other things
As things come up
- '  -  - As Oberfuhrer Scherner and his daughter, in a wedding gown, dance to the music of a quartet on a bandstand, the reception guests drink and eat at tables set up on an expansive lawn
The  doesn't own the trains, somebody's got to pay
Whether it's a passenger car or a livestock car, it doesn't matter -- which, by the way, you have to see
You have to set aside an afternoon, go down to the station and see this
Other  and Army officers share the table with Czurda
Schindler, too, nice blue shirt, jacket, only he doesn't seem to be paying attention; rather his attention and affections are directed to the blonde next to him, Ingrid
So you got thousands of fares that have to be paid
Since it's the that's reserved the trains, logically they should pay
But this is a lot of money
(pause) The Jews
They're the ones riding the trains, they should pay
So you got Jews paying their own fares to ride on cattle cars to God knows where
They pay the  full fare, the  turns around, pays the railroad a reduced excursion fare, and pockets the difference
He shrugs, There you have it
Brilliant
He glances off, sees something odd across the yard
Two horses, saddled-up, being led into the garden by a stable boy
(to Ingrid) Excuse me
Schindler gets up from the table
Scherner, his wife and daughter and son-in-law stare at the horses; they're beautiful
Schindler appears, takes the reins from the stable boy, hands one set to the bride and the other to the groom
There's nothing more sacred than marriage
No happier an occasion than one's wedding day
wish you all the best
Scherner hails a photographer
As the guy comes over with his camera, so does just about everybody else
Scherner insists Schindler pose with the astonished bride and groom
Big smiles
Flash
-  - neighborhood place
Bread, pastries, couple of tables
At one sits owner and a well-dressed man in his seventies, Max Redlicht
go to the bank,  go in, they tell me my account's been placed in Trust
In Trust
What are they talking about, whose Trust
The Germans'
look around
Now  see that everybody's arguing, they can't get to their money either
This is true
'll take you there
Max looks at the man not without sympathy
He's never heard of such a thing
It's really a bad deal
But then -- Let me understand
The Nazis have taken your money
So because they've done this to you, you expect me to go unpaid
That's what you're saying
The owner of the place just stares at Redlicht
That makes sense to you
The man doesn't answer
He watches Max get up and cross to the front door where he says something to two of his guys and leaves
The guys come in and start carting out anything of any value: cash register, a chair, a loaf of bread
- Max strolls along the sidewalk, browsing in store windows
People inside and out nod hello, but they despise him, they fear him
Just as he's passing a synagogue, some men in long overcoats cross the street
Einsatzgruppen, they are an elite and wild bunch, one of six Special Chivalrous Duty squads assigned to Cracow
-   - The Sabbath prayers of a congregation of Orthodox Jews are interrupted by a commotion at the rear of the ancient temple
Several non-Orthodox Jews from the street, including Max Redlicht, are being herded inside by the Einsatz Boys
They're made to stand before the Ark in two lines: Orthodox and non
One of the Einsatzgruppen squad removes the parchment Torah scroll while another calmly addresses the assembly: want you to spit on it
want you to walk past, spit on it, and stand over there
No one does anything for a moment
The liberals from the street seem to say with their eyes, Come on, we're all too sophisticated for this; the others, with the beards and sidelocks, silently check with their rabbi
One by one then they file past and spit on the scroll
The last two, the rabbi and Max Redlicht hesitate
They exchange a glance
The rabbi finally does it; the gangster doesn't
After a long tense silence
haven't been to temple must be fifty years
(to the rabbi) Nor have  been invited
The Einsatz  glances from Max to the rabbi and smiles to himself
This is unexpected, this rift
(to the rabbi) You don't approve of the way  make my living
'm a bad man,  do bad things
Max admits it with a shrug
've done some things
but  won't do this
Silence
The Einsatz  glances away to the others, amused
What does this mean
Of all of you, there's only one who has the guts to say no
One
And he doesn't even believe
(no one, of course answer him) come in here,  ask you to do something no one should ever ask
And you do it
(pause) What won't you do
Nobody answers
He turns to Max
You, sir,  respect
He pulls out a revolver and shoots the old gangster in the head
He's dead before he hits the floor
The rest of you
are beneath his contempt
He turns and walks away
The other Einsatz Boys pull rifles and revolvers from their coats and open fire
- In    and absolute silence, a suitcase thrown from a second story window arcs slowly through the air
As it hits the pavement, spilling open --   -- and, returning to  -- Thousands of families pushing barrows through the streets of Kazimierz, dragging mattresses over the bridge at Podgorze, carrying kettles and fur coats and children on a mass forced exodus into the ghetto
Crowds of Poles line the sidewalks like spectators on a parade route
Some wave
Some take it more soberly, as if sensing they may be next
Goodbye, Jews
- The little folding tables have been dragged out and set up again, and at them sit the clerks
Goldberg, of all people, has somehow managed to elevate himself to a station of some authority
Armed with something more frightening than a gun -- a clipboard -- he abets the Gestapo in their task of deciding who passes through the ghetto gate and who detours to the train station
What's this
Pfefferberg, with his wife Mila, at the head of a line that seems to stretch back forever, flicks at Goldberg's  armband with disgust
Ghetto Police
'm a policeman now, can you believe it
Yeah,  can
They consider each other for a long moment before Pfefferberg leads his wife past Goldberg and into the ghetto
,  - Dismayed by each others' close proximity, Orthodox and liberal Jews wait to use the floor's single bathroom
- From the next apartment comes the liturgical solo of a cantor
In this apartment, looking like they can't bear much more of it, sit some non-Orthodox businessmen, Stern and Schindler
For each thousand you invest, you take from the loading dock five hundred kilos of product a month -- to begin in July and to continue for one year -- after which time, we're even
(he shrugs) That's it
He lets them think about it, pours a shot of cognac from his flask, offers it to Stern, who brought this group together and now sits at Schindler's side
The accountant declines
1 Not good enough
Not good enough
Look where you're living
Look where you've been put
"Not good enough
" (he almost laughs at the squalor) couple of months ago, you'd be right
Not anymore
1 Money's still money
No, it isn't, that's why we're here
Schindler lights a cigarette and waits for their answer
It doesn't come
Just a silence
Which irritates him
Did  call this meeting
You told Mr
Stern you wanted to speak to me
'm here
Now you want to negotiate
The offer's withdrawn
He caps his flask, pockets it, reaches for his top coat
2 How do we know you'll do what you say
Because  said  would
What do you want, a contract
To be filed where
(he slips into his coat) said what 'll do, that's our contract
The investors study him
This is not a manageable German
Whether he's honest or not is impossible to say
Their glances to Stern don't help them; he doesn't know either
The silence in the room is filled by the muffled singing next door
One of the men eventually nods, He's in
Then another
And another
- red power button is pushed, starting the motor of a huge metal press
The machine whirs, louder, louder
-   - Schindler, at a wall of a windows, is peering down at the lone technician making adjustments to the machine
The standard  rate for Jewish skilled labor is seven Marks a day, five for unskilled and women
This is what you pay the Economic Office, the laborers themselves receive nothing
Poles you pay wages
Generally, they get a little more
Are you listening
Schindler turns from the wall of glass to face his new accountant
What was that about the , the rate, the
The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the , not to the worker
He gets nothing
But it's less
It's less than what would pay a Pole
That's the point 'm trying to make
Poles cost more
Stern hesitates, then nods
The look on Schindler's face says, Well, what's to debate, the answer's clear to any fool
Why should  hire Poles
- Another machine starting up, growling louder, louder -- ,   - To a yellow identity card with a sepia photograph a German clerk attaches a blue sticker, the holy Blauschein, proof that the carrier is an essential worker
At other folding tables other clerks pass summary judgment on hundreds of ghetto dwellers standing in long lines
'm a teacher
The man tries to hand over documentation supporting the claim along with his Kennkarte to a German clerk
Not essential work, stand over there
Over there, other "non-essential people" are climbing onto trucks bound for unknown destinations
The teacher reluctantly relinquishes his place in line
-  - The teacher at the head of the line again, but this time with Stern at his side
'm a metal polisher
He hands over a piece of paper
The clerk takes a look, is satisfied with it, brushes glue on the back of a Blauschein and sticks it to the man's work card
Good
The world's gone mad
- Another machine starting up, a lathe
technician points things out to the teacher and some others recruited by Stern
The motor grinds louder, louder
- Schindler wanders around a large empty apartment
There's lots of light, glass bricks, modern lines, windows looking out on a park
- The same place full of furniture and people
Lots of  in uniform
Wine
Girls
Schindler, drinking with Oberfuhrer Scherner, keeps glancing across the room to a particularly good-looking Polish girl with another guy in uniform
'd never ask you for money, you know that
don't even like talking about it -- money, favors --  find it very awkward, it makes me very uncomfortable -- No, look
It's the others
They're the ones causing these delays
What others
Whoever
They're the ones
They'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me
Scherner thinks he understands what Schindler's saying
Just in case he doesn't -- should send it to you, though, don't you think
You can forward it on
'd be grateful
Scherner nods
Yes, they understand each other
That'd be fine
Done
Let's not talk about it anymore, let's have a good time
- Scherner at his desk initialing several Armaments contracts
The letters
appear on all of them
- Men and pulleys hoist a big "" up the side of the building
Down below, Schindler watches as the letter is set into place -- - The good-looking Polish girl from the party, Klonowska, is shown to her desk by Stern
It's right outside Schindler's office
This girl has never typed in her life
- Flames ignite with a whoosh in one of the huge furnaces
The needle on a gauge slowly climbs
- garage door slides open revealing a gleaming black Mercedes
Schindler steps past Pfefferberg and, moving around the car, carefully touches its smooth lines
- Another machine starts up
Another
Another
- Stern with a woman at the head of a line
The clerk affixes the all-important blue sticker to her work card
- Three hundred Jewish laborers, men and women, work at the long tables, at the presses, the latches, the furnaces, turning out field kitchenware and mess kits
Few glance up from their work at Schindler, the big gold party pin stuck into his lapel, as he moves through the place, his place, his factory, in full operation
He climbs the stairs to the offices where several secretaries process Armaments orders
He gestures to Stern, at a desk covered with ledgers, to join him in his office
'  -  - The accountant follows Schindler into the office
Sit down
Schindler goes to the wall of windows, his favorite place in the world, and looks down at all the activity below
He pours two drinks from a decanter and, turning back, holds one out to Stern
Stern, of course, declines
Schinder groans
Oh, come on
He comes over and puts the drink in Stern's hand, moves behind his desk and sits
My father was fond of saying you need three things in life
good doctor, a forgiving priest and a clever accountant
The first two
He dismisses them with a shrug; he's never had much use for either
But the third -- he raises his glass to the accountant
Stern's glass stays in his lap
(long sufferingly) Just pretend for Christ's sake
Stern slowly raises his glass
Thank you
Schindler drinks; Stern doesn't
'  - Klonowska, wearing a man's silk robe, traipses past the remains of a party to the front door
Opening it reveals a nice looking, nicely dressed woman
Yes
series of realizations is made by each of them, quickly, silently, ending up with Klonowska looking ill
(
) Who is it
'  - Schindler sets a cup of coffee down in front of his wife
Behind him, through a doorway, Klonowska can be seen hurriedly gathering her things
She's so embarrassed -- look at her -- Emilie begrudges him a glance to the bedroom, catching the girl just as she looks up -- embarrassed
You know what, you'd like her
Oskar, please -- What -- don't have to like her just because you do
It doesn't work that way
You would, though
That's what 'm saying
His face is complete innocence
It's the first thing she fell in love with; and perhaps the thing that keeps her from killing him now
Klonowska emerges from the bedroom thoroughly self-conscious
Goodbye
It was a pleasure meeting you
She shakes Emilie's limp hand
Schindler sees her to the door, lets her out and returns to the table, smiling to himself
Emilie's glancing around at the place
You've done well here
He nods; he's proud of it
He studies her
You look great
'   - They emerge from the building in formal clothes, both of them looking great
It's wet and slick; the doorman offers Emilie his arm
Careful of the pavement -- -- Mrs
Schindler
The doorman shoots a glance to Schindler that asks, clearly, Really
Schindler opens the passenger door of the Mercedes for his wife, and the doorman helps her in
- nice place
"No Jews or Dogs Allowed
" The maitre 'd welcomes the couple warmly, shakes Schindler's hand
Nodding to his date -- Mrs
Schindler
The maitre 'd tries to bury his surprise
He's almost successful
-  - No fewer than four waiters attend them -- refilling a glass, sliding pastries onto china, lighting Schindler's cigarette, raking crumbs from the table with little combs
It's not a charade, all this
charade
How could it be a charade
She doesn't know, but she does know him
And all these signs of apparent success just don't fit his profile
Schindler lets her in on a discovery
There's no way  could have known this before, but there was always something missing
In every business tried,  see now it wasn't me that was failing, it was this thing, this missing thing
Even if 'd known what it was, there's nothing  could have done about it, because you can't create this sort of thing
And it makes all the difference in the world between success and failure
He waits for her to guess what the thing is
His looks says, It's so simple, how can you not know
Luck
War
- "Gloomy Sunday" from a combo on a stage
Schindler and Emilie dancing
Pressed against her -- both have had a few -- he can feel her laugh to herself
What
feel like an old-fashioned couple
It feels good
He smiles, even as his eyes roam the room and find and meet the eyes of a German girl dancing with another man
'  -  - Schindler and Emilie lounging in bed, champagne bottle on the nightstand
Long silence before -- Should  stay
(pause) It's a beautiful city
That's not the answer she's looking for and he knows it
Should  stay
(pause) It's up to you
That's not it either
No, it's up to you
Schindler stares out at the lights of the city
They look like jewels
Promise me no doorman or maitre 'd will presume  am anyone other than Mrs
Schindler
and 'll stay
He promises her nothing
- Emilie waves goodbye to him from a first-class compartment window
Down on the platform, he waves goodbye to her
as the train pulls away, he turns away, and the platform of the next track is revealed -- soldiers and clerks supervising the boarding of hundreds of people onto another train -- the image turning
Your luggage will follow you
Make sure it's clearly labeled
Leave your luggage on the platform
- As workers load crates of enamelware onto trucks -- back to -- Stern and Schindler and the dock foreman confer over an invoice
More to Stern -- Every other time it's been all right
This time when  weigh the truck, see he's heavy, he's loaded too much
point this out to him,  tell him to wait, he tells me he's got a new arrangement with Mr
Schindler -- (to Schindler) -- that you know all about it and it's okay with you
It's "okay" with me
On the surface, Schindler remains calm; underneath, he's livid
Clearly it's not "okay" with him
How heavy was he
Not that much, just too much for it to be a mistake -- 200 kilos
Stern and Schindler exchange a glance
Then -- (pause) You're sure
The foreman nods
- Pfefferberg and Schindler bang in through the front door, startling a woman at a desk
Can  help you
They move past her without a word and into the back of the place, into a storeroom
They stride past long racks full of enamelware and other goods
man glances up, sees them coming
He's one of Schindler's investors, the one who questioned the German's word
The man's teenage sons rush to their father's defense, but Pfefferberg grabs him and locks an arm tightly around his neck
Silence
Then, calmly -- If you or anyone acting as an agent for you comes to my factory again, 'll have you arrested
It was a mistake
It was a mistake
What was a mistake
How do you know what 'm talking about
All right, it wasn't a mistake, but it was one time
We had a deal, you broke it
One phone call and your whole family is dead
He turns and walks away
Pfefferberg lets the guy go and follows
The investor's sons help their father up off the floor
Gasping, he yells
gave you money
-- but Schindler and Pfefferberg are already gone, coming through the front office and out the front door -- -  - -- to the street
Pfefferberg looks a little shaken from the experience
Schindler straightens his friend's clothes
How you feeling, all right
Yeah
What's the matter, everything all right at home
(Pfefferberg nods) Mila's okay
She's good
Well, then, Schindler can't imagine what could be wrong
He pats Pfefferberg on the shoulder and leads him away
Good
- The long tables accommodate most of workers
The rest eat their lunch on the floor
Soup and bread
'  -   - An elegant place setting for one
Meat, vegetables, glass of wine, all untouched
Schindler leafing through pages of a report Stern has prepared for him
could try to read this or  could eat my lunch while it's till hot
We're doing well
Yes
Better this month than last
Yes
Any reason to think next month will be worse
The war could end
No chance of that
Satisfied, Schindler returns the report to his accountant and starts to eat
Stern knows he is excused, but looks like he wants to say something more; he just doesn't know how to say it
(impatient) What
(pause) There's a machinist outside who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job
Schindler gives his accountant a long-suffering look
He asks every day
It'll just take a minute
He's very grateful
Schindler's silence says, Is this really necessary
Stern pretends it's a tacit okay, goes to the door and pokes his head out
Mr
Lowenstein
An old man with one arm appears in the doorway and Schindler glances to the ceiling, to heaven
As the man slowly makes his way into the room, Schindler sees the bruises on his face
And when he speaks, only half his mouth moves; the other half is paralyzed
want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work
You're welcome, 'm sure you're doing a great job
Schindler shakes the man's hand perfunctorily and tells Stern with a look, okay, that's enough, get him out of here
The  beat me up
They would have killed me, but 'm essential to the war effort, thanks to you
That's great
work hard for you
'll continue to work hard for you
That's great, thanks
God bless you, sir
Yeah, okay
You're a good man
Schindler is dying, and telling Stern with his eyes, Get this guy out of here
Stern takes the man's arm
Okay, Mr
Lowenstein
He saved my life
Yes, he did
God bless him
Yes
They disappear out the door
Schindler sits down to his meal
And tries to eat it
- Stern and Schindler emerge from the rear of the factory
The Mercedes is waiting, the back door held open by a driver
Climbing in -- Don't ever do that to me again
Do what
Stern knows what he means
And Schindler knows he knows
Close the door
The driver closes the door
- Snow on the ground and more coming down
hundred of Schindler's workers marching past the ghetto gate, as is the custom, under armed guard
Turning onto Zablocie Street, they're halted by an  unit standing around some trucks
- Shovels scraping at snow
The marchers working to clear it from the street
dialog between one of the guards and an officer is interrupted by a shot -- and the face of the one-armed machinist falls into the frame
,   - Herman Toffel, an  contact of Schindler's who he actually likes, sits behind his desk
It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar,  know it and you know it, it's a matter of national priority to these guys
It's got a ritual significance to them, Jews shoveling snow
lost a day of production
lost a worker
expect to be compensated
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right
Would it do any good
No
Schindler knows it's not Toffel's fault, but the whole situation is maddening to him
He shakes his head in disgust
think you're going to have to put up with a lot of snow shoveling yet
Schindler gets up, shakes Toffel's hand, turns to leave
one-armed machinist, Oskar
(right back) He was a metal press operator, quite skilled
Toffel nods, smiles
- From a distance, Stern and Schindler slowly walk a wasteland that lies between the rear of  and two other factories -- a radiator works and a box plant
Stern's doing all the talking, in his usual quiet but persuasive manner
Every so often, Schindler, glancing from his own factory to the others, nods
'  - The party pins the two other German businessmen wear are nothing compared to the elaborate thing in Schindler's lapel
He sits at his desk sipping cognac, a large portrait of Hitler hanging prominently on the wall behind him
Unlike your radiators -- and your boxes -- my products aren't for sale on the open market
This company has only one client, the German Army
And lately 've been having trouble fulfilling my obligations to my client
With your help,  hope the problem can be solved
The problem, simply, is space
Stern, who has been keeping a low profile, hands the gentlemen each a set of documents
'd like you to consider a proposal which  think you'll find equitable
'd like you to think about it and get back to me as soon as -- Excuse me -- do you really think this is appropriate
The man glances to Stern, and back to Schindler, his look saying, This is wrong, having a Jew present while we discuss business
If Schindler catches his meaning, he doesn't admit it
Kuhnpast almost sighs
can appreciate your problem
If had any space  could lease you, would
don't
'm sorry
Me neither, sorry
don't want to lease your facilities, want to buy them
'm prepared to offer you fair market value
And to let you stay on, if you want, as supervisors
(pause) On salary
There's a long stunned silence
The Germans can't believe it
After the initial shock wears off, Kuhnpast has to laugh
You've got to be kidding
Nobody is kidding
(pause) Thanks for the drink
He sets it down, gets up
Hohne gets up
They return the documents to Stern and turn to leave
They aren't quite out the door when Schindler wonders out loud to Stern: You try to be fair to people, they walk out the door; 've never understood that
What's next
Christmas presents
Ah, yes
The businessmen slow, but don't look back into the room
'  -  - Pfefferberg wipes a smudge from the hood of an otherwise pristine  Cabriolet
As Scherner and his wife emerge from their house in robes, Scherner whispers to himself -- Oskar
'   - Workers high on the side of the building toss down the letters of the radiator sign as others hoist up a big "
" Under armed guard, others unload a metal press machine from a truck
/   - Technicians make adjustments to presses already in place
Others test the new firing ovens
Kuhnpast is being forcibly removed from the premises
- Crowded beyond belief, the place is like a post office gone mad
Stern, moving along one of the impossibly crowded lines, pauses to speak with an elderly couple
- hand slaps a blue sticker on a work card
Slap, another
And another
And another
- Christmas decorations
Klonowska at her desk, her eyes closed tight
All right
She opens her eyes and smiles
Schindler is holding a poodle in his arms
She comes around to kiss him
He sets the dog on the desk
Stern, across the room, watches blank-faced
(
) Oskar Schindler
Schindler, Stern and Klonowska turn to the voice
Two Gestapo men have entered unannounced
We have a warrant to take your company's business records with us
And another to take you
Schindler stares at them in disbelief
Stern quietly slips one of the ledgers on his desk into a drawer
Am  permitted to have my secretary cancel my appointments for the day
He doesn't wait for their approval
He scribbles down some names -- Toffel, Czurda, Reeder, Scherner
Underlining Scherner, he glances to Klonowska
She understands
,  ,  - humorless middle-level bureaucrat sits behind a desk and 's ledgers and cashbooks
You live very well
The man slowly shakes his head 'no' to Schindler's offer of a cigarette
Schindler tamps it against the crystal of his gold watch
This standard of living comes entirely from legitimate sources,  take it
Schindler lights the cigarette and drags on it, all but ignoring the man
As an  supplier, you have a moral obligation to desist from blackmarket dealings
You're in business to support the war effort, not to fatten -- (interrupting) You know
When my friends ask, 'd love to be able to tell them you treated me with the utmost courtesy and respect
The quiet matter-of-fact tone, more than the comment itself, throws the bureaucrat off his rhythm
His eyes narrow slightly
There's a long silence
/ -   - The two who arrested him lead Schindler down a long hallway
They reach a door, have him step inside and close the door after him
"" - Schindler knocks on the inside of the door
Waffen  man opens it
The "prisoner" peels several bills from a thick wad
Chances of getting a bottle of vodka pretty good
He hands the young guard five times the going price
Yes, sir
The guard turns to leave
Wait a minute
He peels off several more bills and hands them over
Pajamas
"" - Perched on the side of the bed in pajamas, Schindler works on a breakfast of herring and eggs, cheeses, rolls and coffee
Someone has also brought him a newspaper
There's an apologetic knock on the door before it opens
'm sorry to disturb you, sir
Whenever you're ready, you're free to leave
,   - Schindler, the Gestapo clerk and one of the arresting officers cross the foyer
'd advise you not to get too comfortable
Sooner or later, law prevails
No matter who your friends are
Schindler ignores the man completely
Reaching the front doors, the clerk turns over the
records to their owner and offers his hand
Schindler lets it hang there
You expect me to walk home, or what
(tightly) Bring a car around for Mr
Schindler
- Gestapo limousine pulls in through the gates of the factory, parks near the loading docks
The driver, the same  officer, waits for Schindler to climb out, but he doesn't; he waits for the  man to come around and open the door for him
If you'd return the ledgers to my office 'd appreciate it
There are no less than forty able-bodied Jewish laborers working on the docks, any one of which would be better suited to the task
The Gestapo man calls to one of them
Excuse me -- hey -- (the guy turns) They're working
The guy just stares
Finally he heads off with the ledgers
The poodle bounds out past him and over to Schindler
He gives the dog a pat on the head
'  - Elegantly dressed for a night out, Schindler and Klonowska emerge from the building
As they're escorted to the waiting car, Schindler hesitates
nervous figure in the shadows of an alcove is gesturing to him, beckoning him
Schindler excuses himself
Klonowska watches as he joins the man in the alcove
Their whispered conversation is over quickly and the man hurries off
-  -  - From the locomotive, looking back, the string of splattered livestock carriages stretches into darkness
There's a lot of activity on the platform
Guards mill
Handcards piled with luggage trundle by
People hand up children to others already in the cars and climb aboard after them
The clerks are out in full force with their lists and clipboards, reminding the travelers to label their suitcases
Climbing from his Mercedes, Schindler stares
He's heard of this, but actually seeing the juxtaposition -- human and cattle cars -- this is something else
Recovering, he tells Klonowska to stay in the car and, moving along the side of the train, calls Stern's name to the faces peering out from behind the slats and barbed wire
-- -- several pages-worth on a clipboard; a Gestapo clerk methodically leafing through them
(
) He's essential
Without him, everything comes to a grinding halt
If that happens -- Itzhak Stern
(Schindler nods) He's on the list
He is
The clerk shows him the list, points out the name to him
Well, let's find him
He's on the list
If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list
He's on the list
You can't have him
'm talking to a clerk
Schindler pulls out a small notepad and drops his voice to a hard murmur, the growl of a reasonable man who isn't ready -- yet -- to bring out his heavy guns: What's your name
Sir, the list is correct
didn't ask you about the list, asked you your name
Klaus Tauber
As Schindler writes it down, the clerk has second thoughts and calls to a superior, an  sergeant, who comes over
The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made
My plant manager is somewhere on this train
If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why
The sergeant takes a good hard look at the clothes, at the pin, at the man wearing them
(to the clerk) Is he on the list
Yes, sir
(to Schindler) The list is correct, sir
There's nothing  can do
May as well get your name while you're here
My name
My name is Kunder
Sergeant Kunder
What's yours
Schindler
The sergeant takes out a pad
Now all three of them have lists
He jots down Schindler's name
Schindler jots down his and flips the pad closed
Sergeant, Mr
Tauber, thank you very much
think  can guarantee you you'll both be in Southern Russia before the end of the month
Good evening
He walks away, back toward his car
The clerk and sergeant smile
But slowly, slowly, the smiles sour at the possibility that this man calmly walking away from them could somehow arrange such a fate
-- -- Schindler, the clerk and the sergeant -- stride along the side of the cars
Two of them are calling out loudly -- & Stern
Itzhak Stern
Soon it seems as if everybody except Schindler is yelling out the name
As they reach the last few cars, the accountant's face appears through the slats
There he is
Open it
Guards yank at a lever, slide the gate open
Stern climbs down
The clerk draws a line through his name on the list and hands the clipboard to Schindler
Initial it, please
(Schindler initials the change) And this
As Schindler signs three or four forms, the guards slide the carriage gate closed
Those left inside seem grateful for the extra space
It makes no difference to us, you understand -- this one, that one
It's the inconvenience to the list
It's the paperwork
Schindler returns the clipboard
The sergeant motions to another who motions to the engineer
As the train pulls out, Stern tries to keep up with Schindler who's striding away
somehow left my work card at home
tried to tell them it was a mistake, but they -- Schindler silences him with a look
He's livid
Stern glances down at the ground
'm sorry
It was stupid
(contrite) Thank you
Schindler turns away and heads for the car
Stern hurries after him
They pass an area where all the luggage, carefully tagged, has been left -- the image becoming  and
/
- Mechanics' hood-lamps throw down pools of light through which me wheel handcarts piled high with suitcases, briefcases, steamer trunks --  and
Moving along with one of the handcarts into a huge garage past racks of clothes, each item tagged, past musical instruments, furniture, paintings, against one wall -- children's toys, sorted by size
The cart stops
valise is handed to someone who dumps and sorts the contents on a greasy table
The jewelry is taken to another area, to a pit, one of two deep lubrication bays filled with watches, bracelets, necklaces, candelabra, Passover platters, gold in one, silver the other, and tossed in
At workbenches, four Jewish jewelers under  guard sift and sort and weigh and grade diamonds, pearls, pendants, brooches children's rings -- faltering only once, when a uniformed figure upends a box, spilling out gold teeth smeared with blood -- the image saturating with
- Fractured gravestones like broken teeth jut from the earth of a neglected Jewish cemetery outside of town
Down the road that runs alongside it comes a German staff car
-  - In the backseat, Untersturmfuhrer Amon Goeth pulls on a flask of schnapps
His age and build are about that of Schindler's; his face open and pleasant
Make a nice driveway
The other  officers in the car -- Knude, Haase and Hujar -- aren't sure what he means
He's peering out the window at the tombstones
- The staff car passes through the portals of the ghetto and down the trolley lines of Lwowska Street
-  - As the car slowly cruises through the ghetto, Knude, like a tour guide, briefs the new man, Goeth -- This street divides the ghetto just about in half
On the right -- Ghetto : civil employees, industry workers, so on
On the left, Ghetto : surplus labor, the elderly mostly
Which is where you'll probably want to start
The look Goeth gives Knude tells him to refrain, if he would, from offering tactical opinions
Of course that's entirely up to you
- Outside of town, a previously abandoned limestone quarry lies nestled between two hills
The stone and brick buildings look like they've been here forever; the wooden structures, those that are up, are built of freshly-cut lumber
There's a great deal of activity
New construction and renovation -- foundations being poured, rail tracks being laid, fences and watchtowers going up, heavy segments of huts -- wall panels, eaves sections -- being dragged uphill by teams of bescarved women like some ancient Egyptian industry
Goeth surveys the site from a knoll, clearly pleased with it
But then he's distracted by voices -- a man's, a woman's -- arguing down where some barracks are being erected
The woman breaks off the dialog with a disgusted wave of her hand and stalks back to a half-finished barracks
The man, one from the car, Hujar, sees Goeth, Knude and Haase coming down the hill and moves to meet them
She says the foundation was poured wrong, she's got to take it down told her it's a barracks, not a fucking hotel, fucking Jew engineer
Goeth watches the woman moving around the shell of the building, pointing, directing, telling the workers to take it all down
He goes to take a closer look
She comes over
The entire foundation has to be dug up and re-poured
If it isn't, the thing will collapse before it's even completed
Goeth considers the foundation as if he knew about such things
He nods pensively
Then turns to Hujar
(calmly) Shoot her
It's hard to tell which is more stunned by the order, the woman or Hujar
Both stare at Goeth in disbelief
He gives her the reason along with a shrug -- You argued with my man
(to Hujar) Shoot her
Hujar unholsters his pistol but holds it limply at his side
The workers become aware of what's happening and still their hammers
Sir
Goeth groans and takes the gun from him and puts it to the woman's head
Calmly to her -- 'm sure you're right
He fires
She crumples to the ground
He returns the gun to his stunned inferior and, gesturing down at the body, addresses the workers
That's somebody who knew what they were doing
That's somebody  needed
(pause) Take it down, re-pour it, rebuild it, like she said
He turns and walks away
- Stable boys lead two horses into the pre-dawn light
The animals' hoofs shatter tufts of weeds like fingers of glass; fog plumes from their nostrils
,  - In addition to the exhaust from idling trucks and the curling smoke from the Sonderkommando units' cigarettes, there is excitement in the chilly pre-dawn air
- An empty street
Rooftops against a lightening sky
few of the windows in the buildings are lighted, glowing amber; the majority are still dark
- The stable boys hoist saddles onto the horses, cinch the straps
Leaning against the hood of the Mercedes, Schindler and Ingrid, in long hacking jackets, riding breeches and boots, share cognac from his flask
,  - Untersturmfuhrer Goeth, soon to be Commandant Goeth, stands before the assembled troops with a flask of cognac in his hand
He looks out over them proudly; they're good boys, these, the best
He addresses them -- Today is history
The young will ask with wonder about this day
Today is history and you are a part of it
,  - fourteen year old kid hurries across to the square pulling on his
armband
Several others of the Jewish Ghetto Police, Golberg among them, are already assembled there
The clerks, the list makers, scissor open their folding tables, set out their ink pads and stamps
(
) When, elsewhere, they were footing the blame for the Black Death, Kazimierz the Great, so called, told the Jews they could come to Cracow
They came
- Ingrid climbs onto one of the horses, Schindler onto the other
As the animals gallop away with their riders toward a wood, the stable boys wave
(
) They trundled their belongings into this city, they settled, they took hold, they prospered
,  - The fresh young faces of the Sonderkommandos, listening to their commander
For six centuries, there has been a Jewish Cracow
- The horses panting hard
Their hoofs hammering at the ground, climbing a hill
Riding boots kicking at their flanks
,  - The boots of Amon Goeth slowly pacing
He stops
Tight on his face, smiling pleasantly
By this weekend, those six centuries, they're a rumor
They never happened
Today is history
- The galloping horses break through to a clearing high on a hill
The riders pull in the reins and the hoofs rip at the earth
Schindler smiles at the view, the beauty of it with the sun just coming up
From here, all of Cracow can be seen in striking relief, like a model of a town
He can see the Vistula, the river that separates the ghetto from Kazimierz; Wawel Castle, from where the National Socialist Party's Hans Frank rules the Government General of Poland; beyond it, the center of town
He begins to notice refinements: the walls that define the ghetto; Peace Square, the assembly of men and boys
He notices a line of trucks rolling east across the Kosciuscko Bridge, and another across the bridge at Podgorze, a third along Zablocie Street, all angling in on the ghetto like spokes to a hub
- The wheels of the last truck clear the portals at Lwowska Street and the Sonderkommandos jump down
- Families are routed from their apartments
An appeal to be allowed to pack is answered with a rifle butt; an unannounced move to a desk drawer is countered with a shot
,  - Spilling out of the buildings, they're herded into lines without regard to family consideration; some other unfathomable system is at work here
The wailing protests of a woman to join her husband's line are abruptly cut off by a short burst of gunfire
- From here, the action down below seems staged, unreal; the rifle bursts no louder than caps
Dismounting, Schindler moves closer to the edge of the hill, curious
His attention is drawn to a small distant figure, all in red, at the rear of one of the many columns
- Small red shoes against a forest of gleaming black boots Waffen  man occasionally corrects the little girl's drift, fraternally it seems, nudging her gently back in line with the barrel of his rifle
volley of shots echoes from up the street
- Schindler watches as the girl slowly wanders away unnoticed by the
Against the grays of the buildings and street she's like a moving red target
- truck thundering down the street obscures her for a moment
Then she's moving past a pile of bodies, old people executed in the street
- Schindler watches: she's so conspicuous, yet she keeps moving -- past crowds, past dogs, past trucks -- as though she were invisible
- Patients in white gowns, and doctors and nurses in white, are herded out the doors of a convalescent hospital
The small figure in red moves past them
Shots explode behind her
- Short bursts of light flash throughout the ghetto like stars
Schindler, fixated on the figure in red, loses sight of her as she turns a corner
- She climbs the stairs
The building is empty
She steps inside an apartment and moves through it
It's been ransacked
As she crawls under the bed, the scene  of
The gunfire outside sounds like firecrackers
- Silence
Schindler and Ingrid are gone
Below, the ghetto lies like a void within the city, its perimeter and interior clearly distinguishable by darkness
Outside it, the lights of the rest of Cracow glimmer
- Tables and tools and enamelware scrap
The metal presses and lathes, still
The firing ovens, cold
The gauges at zero
Against the wall of windows overlooking the empty factory floor stands a figure, Schindler, in silhouette against the glass, black against white, not moving, just staring down
-  - Bloody wheelbarrows, stark against the tree line of a forest above the completed forced labor camp,
- Names on lists
Names called out
Tight on faces
Goldberg at one of several folding tables
The gangsterturned -- ghetto-cop is now the Lord of Lists inside Plaszow
He and other listmakers call out names, accounting for those thousands who survived the liquidation of the ghetto and now stand before them in long straight rows
' ,  - Amon Goeth stirs, wakes, glances at the woman asleep beside him
Hungover, he drags himself slowly out of bed
'  -   - Goeth steps out onto the balcony in his undershirt and shorts and peers out across the labor camp, his labor camp, his kingdom
Satisfied with it, even amazed, he's reminiscent of Schindler looking down on his kingdom, his factory, as he loves to do, from his wall of glass
Life is great
Goeth reaches for a rifle
- Workers loading quarry rock onto trolleys under Ukrainian guard and a low morning sun
Every so often, one glances with anticipation to the balcony of Goeth's "villa" -- which is in fact nothing more than a two-story stone house perched on a slight rise in the dry landscape
'  -  - The butt of the rifle against his shoulder, Goeth aims down at the quarry -- at this worker, at that one -- indiscriminately, inscrutably
He fires a shot and a distant figure falls
'  -   - The woman in bed groans at the echoing shot
She's used to it but she still hates it; it's such an awful way to be woken
(mutters) Amon
Christ
She buries her head under a pillow
Goeth reappears
He pads to his bathroom, goes inside and urinates
- Schindler's Mercedes winds through the camp, past warehouses and workshops, trucks full of furs and furniture, work details, barracks, guard blocks
man standing alone wears a sign around his neck -- " am a potato thief
" '  -  - The Mercedes pulls in next to some other nice cars parked on a driveway made of tombstones from the Jewish cemetery
, '  - patio table set with crystal, china, silver
Goeth and Hujar are there, in pressed  uniforms, and two industrialists, Bosch and Madritsch
One chair is empty
Your machinery will be moved and installed by the  at no cost to you
You will pay no rent, no maintenance -- Hujar glances off, interrupted by Schindler's arrival
Although he's never been here, the industrialist comes in like he owns the place
All but Goeth rise
No, no, come on, sit -- He works his way around the table, patting Bosch and Madritsch on the back -- he knows them -- shaking Hujar's hand, who he doesn't know
He reaches Goeth
How you doing
Goeth takes a good long look at the handsomely dressed entrepreneur and allows him to shake his hand
We started without you
Good
Schindler takes a seat, shakes a napkin onto his lap, nods to the servant holding out a bottle of champagne to him
Please
Goeth watches him
The others watch Goeth
miss anything important
was explaining to Mr
Bosch and Mr
Madritsch some of the benefits of moving their factories into Plaszow
Oh, good, yeah
Schindler clearly doesn't care, but nods as though he did
He drinks
Goeth just watches him with what seems to be growing amusement
He nods to Hujar to continue
Since your labor is housed on-site, it's available to you at all times
You can work them all night if you want
Your factory policies, whatever they've been in the past, they'll continue to be, they'll be respected -- Schindler laughs out loud, cutting Hujar off
Hujar glances over to Goeth nonplussed
'm sorry
He's not sorry at all, and starts in on the plate of food that's set down in front of him
You know, they told me you were going to be trouble -- Czurda and Scherner
You're kidding
Goeth slowly shakes his head no
then smiles
He looks great, though, doesn't he
have to know -- where do you get a suit like that
what is that, silk
(Schindler nods) It's great
'd say 'd get you one but the guy who made it, he's probably dead, don't know
He shrugs like, those are the breaks, too bad
Goeth just smiles
The others watch the two of them, unsure how they're supposed to react
'  -  -  - The others have gone
It's just Goeth and Schindler now
Goeth pours glasses of cognac
Something wonderful's happened, do you know what it is
Without planning it, we've reached that happy point in our careers where duty and financial opportunity meet
Schindler nods pensively, perhaps in agreement, perhaps at some other thought
There's a silence, broken finally by -- go to work the other day, there's nobody there
Nobody tells me about this,  have to find out,  have to go in, everybody's gone -- They're not gone, they're here
They're mine
His voice echoes into silence
An acquiescent shrug from Goeth finally
And a nod; Schindler's right
Every day that goes by, 'm losing money
Every worker that is shot, costs me money --  have to get somebody else,  have to train them -- We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -- (cutting him off) It's bad business
(shrugs) Some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do
You're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done
(pause) Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example
But that's good business
Schindler pours himself another shot from the bottle, nurses it
He's in a foul mood
They study each other, trying to determine perhaps who's more powerful
Eventually -- Scherner told me something else about you
Yeah, what's that
That you know the meaning of the word gratitude
That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys
True
Goeth tries to put the situation in perspective: You want to stay where you are
You got things going on the side, things are good, you don't want anybody telling you what to do --  can understand all that
(pause) What you want is your own sub-camp
Schindler admits it by not disagreeing
Goeth thinks about it, nods to himself again, then frowns
Do you have any idea what's involved
The paperwork alone
Forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking permits, that's enough to drive you crazy
Then the engineers show up
They stand around and they argue about drainage -- 'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, 've been through it,  know
Well, you've been through it
You know
You could make things easier for me
Goeth mulls it over, his shrug saying "maybe, maybe not
" silence before -- 'd be grateful
There's the word Goeth was waiting to hear
- An  surveyor, with even paces, measures a distance of the bare field adjacent to the factory
He sticks a little flag into the ground
- watchtower, half-erected, the little flag still in the ground
Laborers hammer at it while others roll out barbed wire fencing
surveyor supervises the placement of a post and carefully measures its heights; it has to be nine feet, exactly
At a folding table in the middle of the field, Schindler signs checks made out to the Construction Office, Plaszow -- requisitioning more lumber, cement and hardware
,  - Plaszow prisoners load the requisitioned building supplies -- the lumber, cement and hardware -- onto trucks
/
,  - The trucks parked not at Schindler's sub-camp, but at the loading dock of Goeth's private warehouse in Cracow
Inside the building can be glimpsed all kinds of Plaszow goods: clothes, food, construction equipment, furniture
Checkbook laid out on the hood of his Mercedes, Schindler pays for the requested materials a second time -- this time with a check made out to Amon Goeth personally -- and hands it over to his bagman, Hujar
- Some  architects groan over a set of blueprints
Schindler and an  officer walk by
You have the Poles beat the Czechs, you have the Czechs beat the Poles, that way everybody stays in line
All  have is Jews
He shrugs, Too bad, what're you going to do
The  guy has to think
Yeah, that's a problem
Two huge leashed dogs yank another  man across their path
- As five hundred Plaszow prisoners are marched back onto the grounds of
, any hope they may have had of a more lenient environment is quickly dashed
The place -- completed -- looks like a fortress: barbed-wire, towers,  guards and dogs
- Where once they glimpsed the not too threatening figure of Oskar Schindler strolling through the factory, the workers who dare glance up now find armed guards moving past
And further up, behind the wall of windows, Schindler moving around, entertaining  officer
'  - The Rosner brothers in evening clothes, Leo on accordion, Henry on violin, playing a Strauss melody, trying to keep it muted, inoffensive
Few of the guests pay attention, which is fine with them
An  officer chats with Schindler
-- she's seventy years old, she's been there forever -- they bomb her house
Everything's gone
The furniture, everything
(well aware the man is lying) Thank God she wasn't there
Schindler, with yet another girl on his arm, endures the officer's lies while sweeping the room with his eyes
was thinking maybe you could help her out
Some plates and mugs, some stew pots,  don't know
Say half a gross of everything
Schindler looks at him for the first time, knowingly
She run an orphanage, your aunt
She's old
What she can't use maybe she can sell
Schindler's girl excuses herself to get a drink
You want it sent directly to her or through you
Through me,  think
'd like to enclose a card
Schindler nods, Done
Both watch his date across the room getting a drink
As usual, she's the best-looking on there
Your wife must be a saint
Whatever tolerance Schindler's had up to this point with John leaves his face; the looks he gives him now is pure contempt
She is
'  -  - Goeth's girl tonight, a Pole, eighteen, nineteen, places a hand on Schindler's sleeve
They're at the important end of the large table with Goeth, along with Czurda and Leo John and their girlfriends
' You're not a soldier
No, dear
There's a picture
Private Schindler
Blanket around his shoulders over in Kharkov
Everyone laughs
Happened to what's his name -- up in Warsaw -- and he was bigger than you, Oskar
Toebbens
Happened to Toebbens
Almost
Himmler goes up to Warsaw, tells the armament guys, "Get the fucking Jews out of Toebbens' factory and put Toebbens in the army," and -- "and sent him to the Front
"  mean, the Front
Everybody laughs
It's true
Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much
pay you too much
Another round of laughs, only this time it's forced
Everybody knows it's true, but you don't say it out loud, and Schindler knows better
Goeth gives him a look; they'll talk later
'  -  - Goeth finds Schindler alone outside smoking a cigarette
Schindler acknowledges him, but that's about it
Finally -- You held back Stern
You held back the one man most important to my business
He's important to my business
What do you want for him, 'll give it to you
want him
(turning back) Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time
Goeth heads back inside
Schindler stays outside, finishing his cigarette
-  - folding table outside the prisoners' barracks
At it, playing cards, two night sentries
figure appears out of the darkness
Schindler
He sets down on the table a fifth of vodka
-  - Stern, summoned from his barracks, watches as Schindler digs through his coat pockets
Nearby, at the table, drinking now, the sentries
From the hill, the villa, the Rosners' music, faint, can be heard
Here
He discreetly hands over to the accountant some cigars scavenged from the party
From another pocket, he retrieves and hands over some tins of food -- all valuable commodities
From another pocket, perhaps not so valuable, but then who knows, a gold lighter
Regarding this last item -- This,  don't know, maybe you can trade it for something
Thank you
Schindler shrugs, It's the least  can do
The two stand around a moment more before Schindler shrugs again, Sorry can't do more
He reaches out, pats Stern on the shoulder, and, turning to leave
got to go, 'll see you
Oskar -- Schindler comes back, but, out of embarrassment or -- maybe he wants to get back to the party -- waits with some impatience for Stern to tell whatever it is he wants to tell him
Lowering his voice -- There's a guy
This thing happened
Goeth came into the metalworks -- : -  - Goeth moves through the crowded metalworks like a goodnatured foreman, nodding to this worker, wishing that one a good morning
He seems satisfied, even pleased, with the level of production
Goldberg is with him
They reach a particular bench, a particular worker, and Goeth smiles pleasantly
What are you making
Not daring to look up, all the worker sees of Goeth is the starched cuff of his shirt
Hinges, sir
The rabbi-turned-metalworker gestures with his head to a pile of hinges on the floor
Goeth nods
And in a tone more like a friend than anything else -- got some workers coming in tomorrow
Where the hell they from again
Yugoslavia
Yugoslavia
got to make room
He shrugs apologetically and pulls out a pocket watch
Make me a hinge
As Goeth times him, Rabbi Levartov works at making a hinge as though his life depended on it -- which it does -- cutting the pieces, wrenching them together, smoothing the edges, all the while keeping count on his head of the seconds ticking away
He finishes and lets it fall onto the others on the floor
Forty seconds
Another
Again the rabbi works feverishly -- cutting, crimping, sanding, hearing the seconds ticking in his head -- and finishing in thirty-five
Goeth nods, impressed
That's very good
What  don't understand, though, is -- you've been working since what, about six this morning
Yet such a small pile of hinges
He understands perfectly
So does Levartov; he has just crafted his own death in exactly 75 seconds
Goeth stands him against the workshop wall and adjusts his shoulders
He pulls out his pistol, puts it to the rabbi's head and pulls the trigger
click
(mumble) Christ -- Annoyed, Goeth extracts the bullet-magazine, slaps it back in and puts the barrel back to the man's head
He pulls the trigger again
and again there's a click
God damn it -- He slams the weapon across Levartov's face and the rabbi slumps dazed to the floor
Looking up into Goeth's face, he knows it's not over
As Goeth walks away -- : -  - Tight on Schindler, a pensive nod, then a shrug
The guy can turn out a hinge in less than a minute
Why the long story
- Rabbi Levartov, brought over to
, works at a table with several others
As Schindler strolls by, the rabbi dares to speak -- Thank you, sir
Schindler has to think a moment before he can figure out who the grateful man is
Oh, yeah
You're welcome
- dead chicken dangling from Hujar's hand, evidence of some kind
Goeth slowly pacing before a work detail of twenty or so men standing still, silent, in a row
Nobody knows who stole the chicken
man walks around with a chicken, nobody notices this
No one confesses
Goeth nods, All right, takes a rifle from a guard and shoots one of the workers at random
With this added incentive, he waits for someone to tell him who stole the chicken
No one does
Still nobody knows
He shrugs, Okay, points the rifle at another worker -- and a boy of fourteen, shuddering and weeping, steps out of line
There we go
Goeth goes over to the boy, and, like a distant relative to a small child, tries to get him to look at his face
It was you
You committed this crime
No, sir
You know who, though
The boy nods, weeps, screams -- Him
He's pointing at the dead man
And Goeth astonishes the entire assembly of workers and guards by believing the boy
He returns the rifle to the guard and walks away
Hujar stares after him, then knowingly at the boy
- truck being loaded with supplies
Schindler signs for it and, appearing as rushed as he always does, returns the clipboard to Stern
Yeah, sure, bring him over
- Schindler comes down the stairs with Klonowska
As they're crossing through the factory -- Thank you, sir
(distracted) That's okay
'  -  - mechanic peering under the hood of Goeth's Adler
Leaning in he accidentally knocks a wrench off the radiator into the fan and there's an awful clatter before the engine dies
The mechanic glances up horrified
'  - As servants hoist a heavy, elaborately tooled saddle from Schindler's trunk - a gift for Goeth -- Schindler sees Stern coming toward him and glances skyward long-sufferingly
- The mechanic, making adjustments to a metal press, glances up as Schindler moves past
Thank -- Yeah, yeah, yeah
- Across the street stands a nervous young woman in a faded dress
She seems to be trying to summon the courage to cross over and onto the factory grounds
- Just inside the factory, she waits as a guard telephones Schindler's office
She can see the wall of windows from where she's standing, and Schindler himself as he appears at it, phone to his ear
He glances down at her disapprovingly and the guard hangs up
He won't see you
-  - The woman alone in a dismal room pulling on nylon stockings
At a mirror, she applies make-up
She slips into a provocative dress
Puts on heels
Parisian hat
And looks in the mirror
- Schindler waits for her on the landing of the stairs
He doesn't recognize her, but smiles to counter the unfortunately possibility she's some old girlfriend he's forgotten
Reaching him, she offers her hand
Miss Krause
How do you do
He can tell now she doesn't know him
He seems relieved
He leads her past Klonowska's desk and into his office
'  - He arranges a chair for her, goes to his liquor cabinet
Pernod
Cognac
No, thank you
He pours himself a drink, warms it in his hands, smiles, clearly take with her
So
The grace with which she's carried herself up to this point seems to evaporate as she struggles to find the words she wants
They say that no one dies here
They say your factory is a haven
They say you are good
Schindler's face changes like a wall going up, a mask of indifference like in the portrait of Adolf Hitler on the wall behind him
Who says that
Everyone
Schindler glances away from her
He seems weary suddenly, depressed
My name is Regina Perlman, not Elsa Krause
've been living in Cracow on false papers since the ghetto massacre
(pause) My parents are in Plaszow
They're old
They're killing old people in Plaszow now
They bury them up in the forest
have no money borrowed these clothes
Will you bring them here
Schindler glances back at her, his face hard, cold, and studies her for a long, long moment before -- don't do that
You've been misled
ask one thing: whether or not a worker has certain skills
That's what  ask and that's what  care about, get out of my office
She stares at him, frightened and bewildered
She feels tears welling up
Cry and 'll have you arrested, swear to God
She hurries out
-  - Schindler barges into Stern's office
In a foul and aggressive mood, he dispenses with pleasantries in order to admonish the accountant -- People die, it's a fact of life
Stern has hardly had time to look up from the work on his desk
He wants to kill everybody
Great
What am  supposed to do, bring everybody over
Is that what you think
Yeah, send them over to Schindler, send them all
His place is a "haven," didn't you know
It's not a factory, it's not an enterprise of any kind, it's a haven for people with no skills whatsoever
Stern's look is all innocence, but Schindler knows better
You think  don't know what you're doing
You're so quiet all the time
know
(with concern) Are you losing money
No, 'm not losing money, that's not the point
What other point is -- (interrupts; yells) It's dangerous
It's dangerous, to me, personally
Silence
Schindler tries to settle down
Then -- You have to understand, Goeth's under enormous pressure
You have to think of it in his situation
He's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people -- he's got a lot of things to worry about
And he's got the war
Which brings out the worst in people
Never the good, always the bad
Always the bad
But in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this
He'd be all right
There'd be just the good aspects of him
Which is a wonderful crook
guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money
And killing
'll admit it's a weakness
don't think he enjoys it
(pause) All right, he does enjoy it, so what
What do you expect me to do about it
There's nothing you can do
'm not asking you to do anything
You came into my office
But it isn't Stern who needs convincing; it's Schindler himself
It's doubtful he even realizes this, but it's clear to Stern
Schindler sighs either at the predicament itself, or at the fact that he's allowed Stern to place him right in the middle of it
He turns to leave, hesitates
He conducts a mental search for a name and eventually comes up with it: Perlman, husband and wife
He unstraps his watch, hands it to Stern
Give it to Goldberg, have him send them over
He leaves
- '  - Distant music, Brahms' lullaby, from the Rosner Brothers way down by the women's barracks calming the inhabitants
Up here on the balcony, Schindler and Goeth, the latter so drunk he can barely stand up, stare out over Goeth's dark kingdom
They don't fear us because we have the power to kill, they fear us because we have the power to kill arbitrarily
man commits a crime, he should know better
We have him killed, we feel pretty good about it
Or we kill him ourselves and we feel even better
That's not power, though, that's justice
That's different than power
Power is when we have every justification to kill -- and we don't
That's power
That's what the emperors had
man stole something, he's brought in before the emperor, he throws himself down on the floor, he begs for mercy, he knows he's going to die
and the emperor pardons him
This worthless man
He lets him go
That's power
That's power
It seems almost as though this temptation toward restraint, this image Schindler has brush-stroked of the merciful emperor, holds some appeal to Goeth
Perhaps, as he stares out over his camp, he imagines himself in the role, wondering what the power Schindler describes might feel like
Eventually, he glances over drunkenly, and almost smiles
Amon the Good
-  - stable boy works to ready Goeth's horse before he arrives
He sticks a bridle into its mouth, throws a riding blanket onto its back, drags out the saddle Schindler bought Goeth
Before he can finish, though, Goeth is there
The boy tries to hide his panic; he knows others have been shot for less
'm sorry, sir, 'm almost done
Oh, that's all right
As Goeth waits, patiently it seems, whistling to himself, the stable boy tries to mask his confusion
- Goeth gallops around his great domain holding himself high in the saddle
But everywhere he looks, it seems, he's confronted with stoop-shouldered sloth
He forces himself to smile benevolently
'  - Goeth comes into his bedroom sweating from his ride
worker with a pail and cloth appears in the bathroom doorway
-- have to report, sir, 've been unable to remove the stains from your bathtub
Goeth steps past him to take a look
The worker is almost shaking, he's so terrified of the violent reprisal he expects to receive
What are you using
Soap, sir
(incredulous) Soap
Not lye
The worker hasn't a defense for himself
Goeth's hand drifts down as if by instinct to the gun in his holster
He stares at the worker
He so wants to shoot him he can hardly stand it, right here, right in the bathroom, put some more stains on the porcelain
He takes a deep breath to calm himself
Then gestures grandly
Go ahead, go on, leave
pardon you
The worker hurries out with his pail and cloth
Goeth just stands there for several moments -- trying to feel the power of emperors he's supposed to be feeling
But he doesn't feel it
All he feels is stupid
'  -   - The worker hurries across the dying lawn outside the villa
He dares a glance back, and at that moment, a hand with a gun appears out the bathroom window and fires
,  - The sentries at their little table again, drinking Schindler's vodka
Nearby, Schindler and Stern outside Stern's barracks
The accountant's tone is hushed: If he didn't steal so much,  could hide it
If he's steal with some discretion
: ' ,  - Goldberg delivers a stack of requisitions and invoices, and leaves without a word
Behind his desk, Stern takes a cursory look at them and shakes his head in dismay
' ,  -   - Stern comes in with the requisitions
Now it's Goldberg's turn to shake his head in dismay; he doesn't want to hear it -- There are fifteen thousand people here -- Goeth says there's twenty-five
There are fifteen
He wants to say sixteen, seventeen, all right, maybe he can get away with it, but ten thousand over
It's stupid
Stern, do me a favor, get out of here
You want to argue about it, go tell Goeth
,  - Stern watches truck being unloaded of bags of flour, rice and other supplies
Goeth nods to Hujar
Hujar calls a halt
The workers climb down, close up the trucks
And, still half full, the trucks rumble off
(
) The  auditors keep coming around, looking over the books -- Goeth knows this -- - The trucks at the loading dock of Goeth's private warehouse
Polish workers, under Hujar's supervision, throwing down the "surplus" bags of flour and rice -- the supplies for the phantom 10,000 prisoners
(
) -- you'd think he'd have the common sense to see what's coming
No, he steals with complete impunity
: -  - They can see Goeth's villa up on the hill; figures moving around behind the windows
There's another party going on up there
Down here, as he nurses a drink from his flask, Schindler thinks about what Stern has told him, and eventually shrugs, Fine, fuck him
So you'll be rid of him
But Stern slowly shakes his head 'no
' If Plaszow is closed, they'll have to send us somewhere else
Where -- who knows
Gross-Rosen maybe
Maybe Auschwitz
There's the irony -- bad as it is, evil as Goeth is, it could get worse
Schindler understands
'll talk to him
think it's too late
Well, 'll talk to somebody
'll take care of it
He hands over to Stern some negotiable items and leaves
-  - Schindler and Senior  Officers Toffel and Scherner share a table in same smoke-filled nightclub they met in
What's he done that's so bad -- take money
That's a crime
Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war
We're here to make money, all of us
There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that
He's taking money
The place produces nothing shouldn't say that -- nothing it produces reaches the Army
That's not all right
So 'll talk to him about it
He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out
Tell me this, though -- has he ever once shown you his appreciation
've yet to see it
Never a courtesy
Never a thank you note
He forgets my wife at Christmas time -- He's got no style, we all know that
So, we should hang him for it
He's stealing from you, Oskar
Of course he's stealing from me, we're in business together
What is this
'm sitting here, suddenly everybody's talking like this is something bad
We take from each other, we take from the Army, everybody uses everybody, it works out, everybody's happy
Not like him
Schindler glances away to the floor show, nods to himself
Glancing back again, he considers the  men with great sobriety
Yeah, well, in some eyes it doesn't matter the amount we steal, it's that we do it
Each of us sitting at this table
His thinly veiled threat of exposure escapes neither  man
The air seems thicker suddenly
He doesn't deserve your loyalty
More important, he's not worth you making threats against us
Did  threaten anybody here
stated a simple fact
The threat still stands, despite Schindler's assurance otherwise, and they all know it
So does Scherner's threat back to him, and they all know that, too
But Schindler just grins, and, glancing away -- Come on, let's watch the girls
- In addition to the mid-day soup and break, there are bowls of fruit on the long work tables
At one of them, several workers are debating which of them will go upstairs to thank Schindler
,
-   - In honor of Schindler's birthday, Goeth has brought over Stern and the Rosners -- the musicians, at the moment, accompanying the best baritone in the Ukrainian garrison
Surrounded by his friends and lovers, Schindler cuts a cake
He receives congratulations from the many  men present and the embraces, in turn, of Ingrid and Klonowska and Goeth
From Stern he gets a handshake
Jewish girl from the shop floor is admitted and timidly approaches the drunken group around Schindler
The  men consider her as a curiosity; Schindler, as he would any beautiful girl
The music breaks and out of the silence comes a small nervous voice: On behalf of the workers
sir
wish you a happy birthday
She hesitates
She's surrounded by  uniforms and swastikas and holstered guns
Schindler smiles; this is a beautiful girl
Thank you
He kisses her on the mouth
The smiles on the faces around them strain
Stern glances to heaven
Amon cocks his head like a confused dog
The kiss is broken, finally, and Schindler smiles again with impunity
Thank them for me
The girl backs away nodding anxiously; all she wants now is out before someone -- her, Schindler, both of them -- gets shot
Henry Rosner nudges Leo and they begin another song
And the party tries to resume
-  - Were they not asleep in their barracks, the prisoners would no doubt shudder at the sight: the clerks are setting up their folding tables
Other figures move around the parade ground in the murky dawn light: these raising a banner, those wheeling filing cabinets across the Appellplatz, this one wiring a phonograph, that one saturating a pad with ink from a bottle
Goldberg, Lord of Lists, moves from table to table handing out carbons of lists and sharing morning pleasantries with the clerks
Some men in white appear like ghosts
doctor's kid is opened, a stethoscope removed
Another cleans the lenses of his glasses
Someone sharpens a pencil
-  - trainman waving a lantern guides an engineer who's slowly backing an empty cattle car along the tracks
It couples to another empty slatted car with a harsh clank
-  - The needle of the phonograph is set down on a pocked 78
The first scratchy note of a Strauss waltz blare from the camp speakers
- '  - In his undershirt and shorts Goeth calmly smokes his first cigarette of the morning as he listens to the music wafting up from down below
Down there on the Appellplatz, the entire population of the camp has been concentrated, some fifteen thousand prisoners
-  - Though the music and banners struggle to evoke a country fair, the presence of the doctors belie it
sorting out process is going on here, the healthy from the unhealthy
physician wipes at his brow with his handkerchief as several prisoners run back and forth, naked, before him
He makes his selections quickly: this one into this line, that one into that, and Goldberg moves them recording the names
Other groups of people run naked in front of other doctors and clerks
Notations are made and lines are formed
The sun beats down and the music lies
-  - Some still pulling their clothes back on, the first wave of the "unfit" is marched onto the platform
guard slides open the gate of a cattle car and this first unlucky group climbs aboard
-  - Behind the camouflage of other women prisoners, Mila Pfefferberg rubs a beet against her cheeks in desperate hope of adding a little color to her skin
Amon Goeth, his shirtsleeves uncharacteristically rolled up, chats with one of the doctors as another group strips
Whether the topic is this Health Aktion or the unseasonable weather is unclear, but he nods approvingly
(
) Commandant, sir
Goeth glances up, finds Poldek among the group taking off their clothes
Pfefferberg appeals to him with a look that asks, Do  really have to go through this, and Goeth turns to a clerk
My mechanic
Pfefferberg is motioned away from the others; he's okay, he doesn't have to be put through this indignity
He calls out to the Commandant again -- What about my wife
Goeth thinks about it a moment before he nods, Yeah, okay, sure
clerk accompanies Pfefferberg and, making a notation on the way, finds Mila
-  - The sun is higher, the cattle cars hotter
Prisoners' arms stretch out between the slats offering diamonds in exchange for a sip of water
-  - The needle of the phonograph is set down on another record, a children's song, "Mammi, kauf mir ein Pferdchen" (Mommy, buy me a pony)
Children are yanked from the arms of their parents
Wailing protests quickly escalate to brawls with the guards
Revolvers and rifles aim at the sun and fire
Music, shots, wails
-   - Guards traipse through a deserted barracks peering up at the rafters, pulling planks from the floor, upending cots, looking for some children
-   - small figure in red sprints across to another barracks, past it, to a crude wooden structure beyond it
'  -   - An arm held out to either side, the small girl lowers herself into a pit into which men have defecated
She works her way slowly down, trying to find knee and toeholds on the foul walls, ignoring the flies invading her ears, her nostrils
Reaching the surface of the muck she lets her feet submerge, then her ankles, her shins, her knees, before finally touching harder ground
As she struggles to slow her breathing, her racing heart, she hears a hallucinatory murmur -- ' This is our place
She sees eyes in the darkness; five other children are already there
-  -  - Waves of heat rise from the roofs of the long string of cattle cars
Inside, those who "failed" the medical exams bake as they wait for the last cars to be filled
Schindler's Mercedes pulls up
He climbs out and stares transfixed
He notices Goeth then, standing with the other industrialists, Bosch and Madritsch, and strolls over to them
tried to call you, 'm running a little late, this is taking longer than  thought
Have a drink
What's going on
got a shipment of Hungarians coming in,  got to make room for them
It's always something
He glances away at the train
The idling engine only partially covers the desperate pleas for water coming from inside the slatted cars
They're complaining now
They don't know what complaining is
He grins
Schindler watches as another car is loaded
It's like they're climbing into an oven
What do you say we get your fire brigade out here and hose down the cars
Goeth stares at him blankly, then with a What-will-you-think- of-next
kind of look, then laughs uproariously and calls over to Hujar -- Bring the fire trucks
What
Hujar heard him, he just doesn't get it
Finally he turns to another guy and tells him to do it
onto the scalding rooftops
The fire trucks are there, the hoses firing the cold water at the cars on the people inside who are roaring their gratitude
This is really cruel, Oskar, you're giving them hope
You shouldn't do that, that's cruel
And amusing, not just to Goeth, but to the other  officers standing around as well
Oskar moves away to talk with one of the firemen
At full extension, apparently the hoses still only reach halfway down the long line of cars
He returns to Goeth
've got some 200-meter hoses back at
, we can reach the cars down at the end
Goeth finds this especially sidesplitting, and hollers -- Hujar
have arrived and are being coupled to Plaszow's
As the water drenches the cars further back, the people inside loudly voice their thanks, and the guards and officers outside grin at the spectacle
What does he think he's saving them from
The joke takes on new dimension when, from the back of the trucks, boxes of food are unloaded
Accompanied by the laughter of the , Schindler moves along the string of cars pushing sausages through the slats
Oh, my God
Goeth is almost hysterical
But slowly then, slowly, the amusement on his face fades
His friend moving along the cars bringing futile mercy to the doomed in front of countless men, laughing or not, is not just behaving recklessly here, it's as though he were possessed
The water rains down on the last car
- German staff car pulls in across the factory gate, blocking it
Two Gestapo men climb out
- The girl who brought Schindler best wishes on his birthday glances up from her work to the Gestapo crossing through the factory
They climb the stairs to the upstairs offices and, moments later, appear behind Schindler's wall of glass
'  - Schindler leaning against his desk, drink in his hand, calmly tries to assess his humorless arresters
'm not saying you'll regret it, but you might
want you to be aware of that
1 We'll risk it
Schindler glances beyond them to a point outside his office, to Klonowska
She nods, she knows what to do, she'll make the phone calls, call in the favors
All right, sure, it's a nice day, 'll go for a drive with you guys
He snuffs out his cigarette
-  - Settled comfortably in the backseat, Schindler glances idly out the window
As the car makes a turn, though, he looks back
Apparently he expected it to turn the other way
Where are we going
The guys up front don't answer
Concern, for the first time, registers on Schindler's face
The car approaches a building block long with an ominous sameness to the windows
-  - Schindler is made to empty his pockets, his money, cigarettes, everything
Around him clerks speak in whispers, as if raised voices might set off head-splitting echoes along the narrow monotonous corridors
- He's led down a flight of stairs into a claustrophobic tunnel
He's taken past darkened cells
Past shadowy figures crouched in corners and on the floor
,   - water bucket
waste bucket
No windows
This is not a cell for dignitaries; this arrest is different
Schindler, incongruous with the dank surroundings in his double-breasted suit, slowly paces back and forth before his cellmate, a soldier who looks like he's been here forever, his greatcoat pulled up around his ears for warmth
violated the Race and Resettlement Act
Though  doubt they can point out the actual provision to me
(pause) kissed a Jewish girl
Schindler forces a smile
His cellmate just stares
Now there's a crime; much more impressive, much more serious, than his own
-   - In a stiff-backed chair sits a very unlikely defender of racial improprieties -- Amon Goeth
To an impassive  colonel behind a desk, Goeth tries to highlight extenuating circumstances: He likes women
He likes good-looking women
He sees a good-looking woman, he doesn't think
This guy has so many women
They love him
He's married, he's got all these women
All right, she was Jewish, he shouldn't have done it
But you didn't see this girl
saw this girl
This girl was very good-looking
Goeth tries to read the guy behind the desk, but his face is like a wall
They cast a spell on you, you know, the Jews
You work closely with them like  do, you see this
They have this power, it's like a virus
Some of my men are infected with this virus
They should be pitied, not punished
They should receive treatment, because this is as real as typhus
see this all the time
Goeth shifts in his chair; he knows he's not getting anywhere with this guy
He switches tacts: It's a matter of money
We can discuss that
That'd be all right with me
In the silence that follows, Goeth realizes he has made a serious error in judgment
This man sitting soberly before him is one of that rare breed -- the unbribable official
You're offering me a bribe
"bribe
" No, no, please come on
a gratuity
Suddenly the man stands up and salutes, which thoroughly confuses Goeth since Goeth is his inferior in rank
But he isn't saluting Goeth, he's saluting the officer who has just stepped into the room behind him
Sit down
The colonel sits back down
Scherner pulls up a chair next to Goeth
Hello, Amon
Sir
Scherner smiles and allows Goeth to shake his hand, but it's clear, even to Goeth himself, that he has fallen from grace
'  -  - tall, thin, gray Waffen  officer has a request for the Rosner brothers
want to hear "Gloomy Sunday" again
He's drunk, morose; it seems unlikely he'll be on his feet much longer
Indeed, as Henry and Leo Rosner begin the son -- an excessively melancholy tale in which a young man commits suicide for love -- the field officer staggers over to a chair in the corner of the crowded room and slumps into it
We give you Jewish girls at five marks a day, Oskar, you should kiss us, not them
Goeth laughs too loud, drawing a weary glance from Scherner
Schindler smiles good-naturedly
He's out, a little worse for wear perhaps, a little more subdued than usual
Taking him away from the others, taking him into his confidence -- God forbid you ever get a real taste for Jewish skirt
There's no future in it
No future
They don't have a future
And that's not just good old- fashioned Jew-hating talk
It's policy now
is back in front of the musicians, swaying precariously, a drink in his hand -- "Gloomy Sunday" again
Again they play the song
Again he staggers across the crowded room to his chair in the corner, paying no attention to the visiting Commandant from Treblinka or anybody else -- -- We can process at Treblinka, if everything is working
don't know, maybe two thousand units a day
He shrugs like it's nothing, or with modesty, it's unclear
Goeth is dully impressed; Schindler, only politely so
Now Auschwitz
Now you're talking
What  got is nothing, it's like a
a machine
Auschwitz, though, now there's a death factory
There, they know how to do it
There, they know what they're doing
wavering before Henry and Leo
This time they don't wait for him to ask for it -- "Gloomy Sunday" As the man stumbles back to his chair, the Rosners not only play the song again, they play with it, and him, this one somber man in the corner staring at them almost gratefully, wrenching from the song all the sentimentality they can, as if they could actually drive him to kill himself
No one else in the room is aware of the exchange going on between them -- this man and this music -- which the brothers play as if it were an invocation
Eventually, though, someone does become aware, if not of the intention, at least of the repetition, and interrupts the spell -- Enough -- Jesus -- God -- The music falls apart
The brothers find Goeth in the crowd looking at them like, Come on, for Christ's sake play something else
Which they do -- defeated -- some innocuous Von Suppe
Goeth turns back to one of his guests
Glancing back, as they play, to the corner, the Rosners see the gloomy  officer getting slowly up from his chair
He stands there for a moment, staring at nothing, then slowly makes his way out onto the balcony where he stands in the night air, absolutely still, in silhouette to the Rosners
And, ruining a perfectly good party, he takes out a gun and shoots himself in the head
- From a distance, Schindler can be seen arguing with an officer who's trying to hand him papers, orders of some kind, which the irate industrialist refuses to accept
Here, closer, carrying blankets and bundles, Schindler's workers are marched under heavy guard out of the factory and its annexes and across the fortified yard
His people are being taken
Where, is unclear
Schindler abruptly breaks off the discussion with the  man, climbs into his car and drives off
-  -  - creek flowing gently through marshy ground under an umbrella of trees
Leo John and his five year old son, on their knees catching tadpoles, seem unaware of, or at least not distracted by, a ghastly endeavor going on beyond them: Bodies being exhumed out of the earth, out of the mass graves in the forest
The dead lay everywhere, victims of the ghetto massacre, victims of Plaszow
Arriving, Schindler sees Goeth standing up at the tree line
Approaching him, furious, he hesitates
He sees a wheelbarrow trundled by Pfefferberg, a corpse in it
He fears the body is Mila's, but then sees her trundling another barrow, another corpse in it
Goeth calls to Schindler -- Can you believe this
Goeth shakes his head, dismayed
Schindler joins him and stares at a pyre of bodies built by masked and gagging workers, layer upon layer
'm trying to live my life, they come up with this
got to find every body buried up here
And burn it
It's always something
He glances off
The pyre has reached the height of a man's shoulder
The workers move around it dousing it with gasoline
You took my workers
(indignant) They're taking mine
When  said they didn't have a future  didn't mean tomorrow
(pause) Auschwitz
When
don't know
Soon
He sighs at the unfairness of it all, the dissolution of his kingdom
His glance finds his man, Leo John, over at the stream
This is good
'm out of business and he's catching tadpoles with his son
Tight on the gleeful boy with a tadpole in his hand
Behind him, smoke from the pyre rises into the sky
- Schindler, in silhouette against the wall of glass, stares down at his deserted factory, his silent machines, the dark empty spaces
'  - Light pouring in through the windows
White sheets over the furniture like shrouds over the dead
Schindler's personal things are gone
/  - Schindler's Mercedes, the backseat piled high with suitcases
border guard returns his passport to him
The barrier is lifted and he crosses into Czech countryside
, ,  - church in the main square of a sleepy hamlet
priest and his parishioners, including Emilie Schindler, emerging from it, morning Mass over
Some guys outside a bar/cafe, hanging gout, drinking, notice the elegantly dressed gentleman outside the town's only hotel
They recognize him
They come over
Hey, how you doing
1 Look at this
Schindler, the clothes, the car, the suitcases, the great difference between their respective stations in life
Somehow their old ne'er-do-well friend has managed to do quite well, and it amazes them
Across the square, Emilie has noticed him; and he, her
But neither makes a move toward the other
Finally she walks away; which Schindler interprets correctly to mean, Yes, check into the hotel
He tips the porter extravagantly and turns back to the guys from the bar
Let me buy you a drink
-  - Except for the clothes of the working class clientele, the scene is reminiscent of the  nightclub in Cracow: Schindler, the great entertainer, working his way around the tables making sure everybody's got enough to drink, making sure everybody's happy
guy at a table with a girl gestures him over
2 Oskar - my friend Lena
How do you do
(to them both) What can  get you, what're you drinking
2 Nothing's changed
Then again, something has changed, hasn't it
Things worked out
made some money over there, had some laughs, you know
It was good
2 Now you're back
Now 'm back, and you know what 'm going to do now
'm going to have a good time
So are you
He gestures to the bartender to refill his friend's and his date's drinks, pats the guy on the shoulder and wanders over to the next table
Who is he
The guy has to think; not because he doesn't know, but because his old friend Oskar is so many things it's hard to know which description to use
Finally -- 2 He's a salesman
-  - woman asleep in the bed
The girl from the bar
In his robe, at the window, Schindler calmly smokes as he stares out at the - The town, off in the distance, nestled against the mountains
The sun, just coming up
Closer, here, ramshackle structures, a long abandoned factory of some kind
Schindler, in leather riding gear, climbs down off a Moto- Guzzi motorcycle
He slowly wanders around, peers in through broken windows, wanders around some more
Tight on his face, torn between conflicting choices, or realizing there's no choice, or only one choice, and hating it
Goddamn it
, '  -  - Schindler and Goeth on the balcony of the villa, drinking
You want these people
These people, my people,  want my people
Goeth considers his friend, greatly puzzled
Below them lies the camp, still operating, at least for now, until the shipments can be arranged
What are you, Moses
What is this
Where's the money in this
What's the scam
It's good business
Oh, this is "good business" in your opinion
You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia -- it doesn't make any sense
Look -- You're not telling me something
It's good for me --  know them, 'm familiar with them
It's good for you -- you'll be compensated
It's good for the Army
You know what 'm going to make
Artillery shells
Tank shells
They need that
Everybody's happy
Yeah, sure
Goeth finds this whole line of reasoning impossible to believe
He's sure Schindler's got something else going on here he's not telling him
You're probably scamming me somehow
If 'm making a hundred, you got to be making three
Schindler admits it with a shrug
If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually
But how
just told you
You did, but you didn't
Goeth studies him, searching for the real answer in his face
He can't find it
Yeah, all right, don't tell me, 'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me  can't figure it out
All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you
What's a person worth to you
Goeth thinks about it in the silence
Then a slow nod to himself
He's going to make some money out of this even if he can't figure it out
He smiles
What's one worth to you
That's the question
: slapping a name onto a list -- 184 184  -- the letters the size of buildings, the sound as loud as gunshots -- -- Rabbi Levartov -- the hinge- maker Goeth tried to kill with a faulty revolver -- another name --  -- -- a man, a woman -- the parents of "Elsa Krause
"       -- Stern transcribes
workers' names from a Reich Labor Office document to the list in his typewriter, Schindler's List
--   --  --  --  -- slowly pacing the six or seven steps Stern's cramped office allows, nursing a drink
Poldek Pfefferberg
Mila Pfefferberg
typing - ' face, tight
' face, tight
, hard Reichmarks, in a small valise
As Goeth looks at it, he mumbles to himself -- virus
of names, forty, fifty
The sound of the keys
Stern pulls the sheet out of the machine, rolls in another, types a name
onto trucks outside Madritsch's Plaszow factory
You can do the same thing 'm doing
There's nothing stopping you
Madritsch is shaking his head no' to Schindler's appeal to make his own list, to get his workers out
've done enough for the Jews
typing another name --  , a man,  , a woman,  , a child -- into a glass
The glass coming up to Schindler's mouth, hesitating there
The investors
--   -- one of the original
investors
--   -- another of the Jewish investors
All of them
Szerwitz, his family
with a look that asks Schindler if he's sure about this one
He is
The keys type  -- of the investor who stole from Schindler, the one he threatened to have killed by the , and the faces of his sons -- of names next to the typewriter
Stern, trying to count them, estimates -- Four hundred, four fifty -- More
'  yawning open
He takes a small valise from it and heads for Goeth's villa
typing  -- Henry Rosner, the violinist
his brother, Leo, the accordionist
, the other Plaszow industrialist
The same appeal Schindler made to Madritsch; the same answer, no
' another page of names
(
) About six hundred -- (
) More
the face of a boy, the "chicken thief
" Over     , the one who hid in the pit of excrement
Over the  we've never seen
(
) Eight hundred, give or take
(angrily) Give or take what, Stern -- how many -- count them
down the pages of names, trying to count them more precisely
, dealt by
They're betting diamonds, he and Schindler
queen falls and Goeth groans his misfortune
Goeth's maid
his hold card against the table, is thrown a four, sweeps it again and gets a jack
we don't recognize is typed
we don't recognize
'  -  - Schindler leafing through the page of names, counting them, drinking, to the sound of the typewriter
Eventually, quietly to himself -- That's it
Stern heard him and stops typing, glances over
You can finish that page
Stern resumes where he left off, but then hesitates again
There's something he doesn't understand
What did Goeth say
You just told him how many you needed
It doesn't sound right
And Schindler doesn't answer
He's avoided telling Stern the details of the deal struck with Goeth, and balks telling him now
Finally awkwardly -- 'm buying them
'm paying him give him money, he gives me the people
(pause) If you were still working for me 'd expect you to talk me out of it, it's costing me a fortune
Stern had no idea
And has no idea now what to say
Schindler shrugs like it's no big deal, but Stern knows it is
Give him the list, he'll sign it, he'll get the people ready
have to go back to Brinnlitz, to take care of things on that end, 'll see you there
Stern is really overcome by what this man is doing
What he can't figure out is why
Silence
And then -- Finish the page
Stern turns back, does as he's told
Schindler drinks
Nothing but the sound of the typewriter keys
And then nothing at all
The page is done
The rest will die
-  - Schindler in front of a large assembly, party pin in his lapel, as usual, imposing  guards on either side of him
This is my home
He looks out over his audience, the citizens of Brinnlitz, local government officials, many of them appearing bewildered by him or the "situation" that has arisen
was born here, my wife was born here, my mother is buried here, this is my home
His estranged wife is there
So are the guys he was drinking with
Do you really think 'd bring a thousand Jewish criminals into my home
Everyone seems to breathe sighs of relief as if they've been waiting for him to say this, to dispel the disturbing rumors they've heard
These are skilled munitions workers -- they are essential to the war effort -- The noise begins, his audience's angry reaction
Raising pitch of his own voice -- -- It is my duty to supervise them -- and it is your duty to allow me -- He barely gets it all out before the protests drown him out
The uproar reaches such a clamoring level there's no point in his continuing
'  -  - Goeth, at his writing desk, endures the bureaucratic tedium of signing memoranda, transport orders, requisitions
He comes to Schindler's list, initials each page and signs the last with no more interest than the others
He hands the whole stack of paperwork to Marcel Goldberg, Personnel Clerk, Executor of Lists, Gangster
,   -  - Goldberg has the signature page of the list in a typewriter
He carefully aligns it and types his own name in a space allowed by the bottom margin
'    - At a folding table in the middle of the field, Schindler signs his name to Reich Main Office directives, Evacuation Board and Department of Economy form, Armaments contracts
Around him, the new camp is taking shape: Electric fences are going up, watchtowers, barracks; shipments of heavy equipment, huge Hilo machines, are being off-loaded from flatbed train cars;  engineers stand around frowning at the lay of the land, some drainage problem no doubt
-  - train full of people destined for Auschwitz pulls away from the platform
As Goldberg gathers his paperwork, a prisoner approaches him
Am  on the list
What list is that
He knows what the prisoner means and the prisoner knows he knows
He means Schindler's List
The good list
Well, that depends, doesn't it
The prisoner knows that, too, and discreetly turns over to Goldberg a couple of diamonds from the lining of his coat
'  -  - Names on a notepad, the first few crossed out
Goldberg types the next name onto a page of The List, squeezing it into the upper margin, and crosses that one out on the pad
He rolls the page down, types another name, tires of the exacting task, tears the handwritten page of names from the notepad, crumples it and throws it away
- Schindler, on his way back to his hotel after a night of drinking, is jumped by three guys, wrestled to the ground and brutally kicked
As the forms of his attackers move away, he catches a glimpse of one of them -- his "friend" who admired his car when he first arrived back in town
-  - Pfefferberg, his head under the hood of a German staff car, adjusting the carburetor
Goldberg comes in
Hey, Poldek, how's it going
(Pfefferberg ignores him) You know about the list
You're on it
Of course 'm on it
You want to stay on it
What do you got for me
Pfefferberg glances up from his work and studies the blackmailing collaborator for a long moment
What do  got for you
Takes diamonds to stay on this list
Pfefferberg suddenly attacks him with the wrench in his hand, beating him across the shoulders and head with it
'll kill you, that's what  got for you
Goldberg goes down, tries to scramble away on his knees, the blows coming down hard on his back
All right, all right, all right
He makes it outside the garage and runs
-  - cattle car is coupled to another, the pin dropped into place
On the platform, clerks at folding tables shuffle paper while others mill around with clipboards, calling out names
Thousands of prisoners on the platform, some climbing onto strings of slatted cars on opposing tracks
Some already in them, most standing in lines, changing lines, the end of one virtually indistinguishable from the beginning of another
Paperwork
Lists of names
Pens in hands checking them off
Some bound for Brinnlitz, the rest for Auschwitz, if they can be properly sorted from one another
boy is allowed to remain in a line with his father; his mother is taken to another line composed of women and girls
This segregation is the only recognizable process going on; the others, if they exist, are apparent only to the clerks and guards, and maybe not even to them
It is chaos
- train snakes across the dark landscape
-  - Stern, wedged into a corner of an impossibly crowded car
This train may be headed for Schindler's hometown, but it is no more comfortable than the others on their way to Auschwitz -- Birkenau
-  - The train idles at a crossing in the middle of nowhere
Moving across the faces peering out from between the slats, it becomes apparent there are only male prisoners aboard
Below, on a dirt road, a lone Polish boy stands watching
Just before an empty train roars past from the other direction obscuring him, his hand comes up and across his neck making the gesture of a throat being slit
-  - The train pulls into the small quiet Brinnlitz station
The doors are opened and the prisoners begin climbing down
At the far end of the platform, flanked by several  guards, stands Schindler
To his customary elegant attire he has added a careless accouterment, a Tyrolean hat
- Leading a procession of nine hundred male Jewish "criminals" through the center of town, Schindler ignores the angry taunts and denouncements and the occasional rock hurled by the good citizens of Brinnlitz lining the streets
- Under the towering Hilo machines, a meal of soup and bread awaits the workers
As they're sitting down to it, Schindler addresses them -- You'll be interested to know received a cable this morning from the Personnel Office, Plaszow
The women have left
They should be arriving here sometime tomorrow
He sees Stern among the workers, smiles almost imperceptibly, turns and walks away
- train backs slowly along the tracks toward an arched gatehouse
The women inside the cattle cars don't need a sign to tell them where they are, they've seen this place in nightmares
Pillars of dark smoke rise from the stacks into the sky
It's Auschwitz
- The stunned women climb down from the railcars onto an immense concourse bisecting the already infamous camp
As they're marched across the muddy yard by guards carrying truncheons, Mila Pfefferberg stares at the place
It' so big, like a city, only one in which the inhabitants reside strictly temporarily
To Mila, under her breath -- Where are the clerks
So often terrified by the sight of a clerk with a clipboard, it is the absence of clerks which unsettles the woman now, as though there remains no further reason to record their names
Mila's eyes return to the constant smoke rising beyond the birch trees at the settlement's western end
-   - Schindler comes out of his office and, passing Stern's desk, mumbles -- They're in Auschwitz
Before Stern can react, Schindler is out the door
-   - As he strides across the factory courtyard toward his motorcycle, Schindler is intercepted by some Gestapo men who have just emerged from their car
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested
(pause) 'm sorry to hear that
There are some things that are unclear
We need to talk
'd love to, it'll have to wait until get back
have to leave
The looks on their faces tell him he's not going anywhere
All right, okay, let's talk
In Breslau
Breslau
can't go to Breslau
Not now
These guys are serious
- young silver-haired doctor moves slowly along rows of Schindler's women, considering each with a pleasant smile even as he makes his selections, with tiny gestures, for the death chambers
He pauses in front of one
How old are you, Mother
She could lie, and he'd have killed her for it
She could tell the truth, and he'd have her killed for that, too
(pause) Sir, a mistake's been made
We're not supposed to be here, we work for Oskar Schindler
We're Schindler Jews
The doctor nods pensively, understandingly, it seems
Then -- And who on earth is Oskar Schindler
He glances around hopelessly
One of the  guards who accompanied the women from Plaszow speaks up -- He had a factory in Cracow
Enamelware
The doctor nods again as if the information were valuable, as if it meant something to him
It doesn't
potmaker
He smiles to himself and gets on with the "examination," this woman to this line, this other one to that
-  ,  - In a dank cell, in uniform, Amon Goeth waits
Schindler is on his way, hopefully
Maybe he's already here
Schindler will vouch for him
Schindler will straighten this out
,  - In a large room, Schindler sits before a panel of twelve sober Bureau  investigators and a judge of the  court
Everything you say will be held in confidence
You are not under investigation
You are not under investigation
Mr
Goeth is
He is being held on charges of embezzlement and racketeering
You're here at his request to corroborate his denials
Our information onto his financial speculations comes from many sources
On his behalf there is only you
We know you are close friends
We know this is hard for you
But we must ask you -- He stole our country blind
- In Schindler's absence, the workers attempt to operate the unfamiliar machines, to figure out the unfamiliar process of manufacturing artillery shells
There's movement, there's noise, the machines are running, but little is being produced
Untersturmfuhrer Jose Liepold, the Commandant of Schindler's new subcamp, moves through the factory conducting an impromptu inspection
He points out to a guard a kid no more nine, sorting casings at a work table, and another boy, ten or eleven, carrying a box
-  - Mila and another woman cross back toward their barracks carrying a large heavy pot of broth
Not more than a hundred meters away stand the birch trees and crematoria, the smoke pluming even now, at  out of the darkness appear "apparitions," skeletal figures which surround the two women, or rather the soup pot between them, dipping little metal cups into it, over and over
Too startled to speak, Mila can only stare
The apparitions clamor around the pot a moment more, than furtively slip back into the same darkness from which they came
Mila and the other woman exchange a glance
The pot is empty
Where's Schindler now
'  -  - In his en, over cognac, Auschwitz Commandant Rudolf Hoss considers the documents Schindler has brought: the list, the travel papers, the Evacuation Board authorization
Hoss nods at them, then at Schindler
You're right, a clerical error has bee made
(pause) Let me offer you this in apology for the inconvenience
have a shipment coming in tomorrow, 'll cut you three hundred from it
New ones
These are fresh
Schindler seems to think about the offer as he nurses his drink
It's "tempting
" The train comes, we turn it around, it's yours
appreciate it
want these
The ones on the list in Hoss' hand
Silence
Then: You shouldn't get stuck on names
Why, because you get to know them
Because you begin to see them as human beings
Schindler suddenly has the awful feeling that the women are already dead
Hoss misinterprets the look
That's right, it creates a lot of paperwork
-  - large assembly of women
Guards calling out names from a list
As each woman steps out of line, a guard unceremoniously brushes a swathe of red paint across her clothes
New columns are formed
-  - Schindler, standing at the end of the platform stone-faced, watches the women whose names he is "stuck on," whose clothes are slashed with red paint, climbing onto the cattle cars
As the cars fill, a train on another track arrives
The "fresh" ones Schindler turned down
As the gates are closed on the women's cars, the gates of the others are opened and the people spill out
horrified cry suddenly breaks through the noise of the engines
One of Schindler's women, locked in, has seen her son among those coming down off the train on the opposing track
Another cry erupts, and another, another, as the women spot their children, confiscated from the Brinnlitz factory, brought here
Schindler becomes aware of what's happening and, passing over other children, tries to corral these particular boys, many of whom have noticed their mothers now and are echoing their tortured cries with their own
Schindler manages to gather them together, the fifteen or twenty boys, and, in the middle of the crowded platform, appears to a guard: These are mine
They're on the list
These are my workers
They should be on the train
He points across to the women's train, then down to the boys
They're skilled munition workers
They're essential
The guard glances from the frantic gentleman to the anxious brook around him
These are essential workers
They're boys
Yes
Schindler is nodding his head, trying to think
The women are shrieking their sons' names
The guard, who heard it all, every excuse imaginable, is just turning away when Schindler thrusts his smallest finger at him
Their fingers
They polish the insides of shell casings
How else do you expect me to polish the inside of a 45 millimeter shell casing
The guard stares at him dumbly
This he hasn't heard
- Like a mirage in the distance they appear -- the women, the children, guards, Schindler, marching across a field toward the factory
At the perimeter of the camp, at the wire, the men watch the approaching procession
It appears to them that the women are covered in blood -- or -- could it be paint
They're walking, they're fine, some are even smiling
Liepold isn't smiling
Neither is Schindler; at least not on the outside
- The machines are silent, the people are not
Women are in their husbands' arms, sons in their fathers'
There's food on the tables but it's largely ignored, the reunion taking precedence
-   - Schindler stands before the assembled camp guards
They are seated at the long tables, their food getting cold, waiting for him to say whatever it is he has to say
Under Department  provisions, it is unlawful to kill a worker without just cause
Under the Businesses Compensation Fund  am entitled to file damage claims for such deaths
If you shoot without thinking, you go to prison and  get paid, that's how it works
So there will be no summary executions here
There will be no interference of any kind with production
In hopes of ensuring that, guards will no longer be allowed on the factory floor without my authorization
His eyes meet Liepold's, hold his icy stare, then return to the guards, most of whom look like tired middle-aged reservists
For your cooperation, you have my gratitude
As he steps away he gestures to some kitchen workers
They tear open cases of schnapps and begin setting the bottles out on the tables
- Schindler strolls through his factory looking over the shoulders of the workers, nodding his approval
The place is in full operation, finally; the people, having figured out the complicated Hilos, turning out shells by the caseload
Schindler pauses at one of the machines
How's it going
Good
It's taken a while to calibrate the machines, but it's going good now
Good
Schindler nods
Then frowns
He leans down and taps at the crystal of one of the gauges
This isn't right, is it
The worker kneels down, takes a look
It looks right to him
Reaching over, Schindler changes the calibration of the machine with a cavalier adjustment to a knob -- and all the gauge readings shift
There
That looks right
He wanders off
The worker stares after him
He's just screwed up settings that took weeks to get right
Schindler comes up to another worker, Levartov, the hingemaker
He's at a machine buffing shells
How's it going, Rabbi
Good, sir
Schindler nods, watches him work, eventually glances away
Sun's going down
Levartov, following Schindler's gaze, nods uncertainly
It is Friday, isn't it
Is it
You should be preparing for the Sabbath, shouldn't you
What are you doing here
Levartov just stares
It's been years since he's been allowed, indeed inclined, to perform Sabbath rites
've got some wine in my office
Why don't we go over there, 'll give it to you
Come on, let's go
Schindler heads off
The rabbi keeps staring
Schindler gestures back to him, offering casually -- Come on
Levartov looks around
Finally, he hangs up his goggles and follows after Schindler
- Under the shadow of a watchtower, among the roof-high tiers of bunks strung with laundry, Levartov recites Kiddush over a cup of wine to workers gathered around him
- On their bunks, the guards relax with schnapps, cards and magazines
One of them becomes distracted by a distant sound
Some of the others begin to hear it
What is that
Conversations cease
The barracks gradually becomes quiet, silent, all the guards straining to hear
It sounds like
singing
It sounds like Yiddish singing
-   - On a watchtower, a night sentry, unsure where it's coming from, listens to the distant singing
It seems like it's emanating from the surrounding hills, from the trees
'  -   - At his small desk, Liepold is typing a letter, denouncing Schindler most likely
The pounding keys bury all other sounds but when he pauses to reread what he's typed, he hears it, the singing, faint, far away
He goes to his window, peers out, listens for a moment more, then hears nothing
Only the night creatures
-  - The door to an apartment opens from the inside revealing Emilie Schindler
She coolly considers the visitor on her doorstep, her estranged husband, looking great as usual, bottle of wine in his hand, smiling as if nothing is wrong between them, as if nothing is wrong in the entire world
'  - The two of them at the kitchen table in a modest apartment, drinking, at least he is
He's trying to ask her something, but he's not sure how to put it, he wants to get it right
Finally the words just tumble out -- want you to come work for me
There, he's said it
But the bewildered look on Emilie's face wonders, That's what was hard for you to say
You don't have to live with me, wouldn't ask that
(pause) It's a nice place
You'd like it
It looks awful
You get used to that
She's the only woman he's even known who could make him nervous just sitting across a table from him, saying nothing
All right -- (now he'll be honest) We can spend time together that way
We can see each other, see how it goes -- without the strain of -- whatever you want to call it when a man, a husband and a wife go out to dinner, go have a drink, go to a party, you know
This way we'll see each other at work, there we are, same place, we see how it goes
His voice trails off
shrug adds, What do you think
She doesn't answer, but she does love him
He loves her, too
It really is a shame they're not right for each other and never will be
-   - Stern glances up from his work; Schindler and Emilie have come in and are walking toward the accountant's desk
He gets up
Itzhak Stern, Emilie Schindler
My wife
Like the doormen and waiters of Cracow, Stern too never imagined Schindler was married and has trouble hiding his astonishment now
He extends his hand to her
How do you do
How do you do
Stern is my accountant and friend
It sounds strange to Stern hearing Schindler actually say it
He's never said it before
Emilie's offered to work in the clinic
To
work there
He's not sure what she's going to do there, she's not a nurse or a doctor
(to her) That's very generous of you
Yes
Schindler nods, looks around, shrugs, offers his arm to his wife, perhaps to take her on a tour of the place
It was a pleasure meeting you
Pleasure meeting you
The Schindlers leave
Stern sits back down at his desk and smiles
He's never seen Schindler so uncomfortable
-   - Schindler comes in carrying a radio
He sets it down on a bench where Pfefferberg's working on the frame of a machine motor with a blow torch
Can you fix it
The radio
What's wrong with it
How should  know
It's broken
See what you can do
He leaves
Pfefferberg plugs it into an outlet and switches it on
It works perfectly
waltz
-   - In a male barracks, a group of workers including Pfefferberg huddle in a corner around the radio, straining to hear through heavy static a broadcast by the , the Voice of London, a sketchy report of an Eastern offensive by Allied Russian forces
-   - As a camp doctor attends to sufferers of dysentery, Schindler and Emilie sort pairs of prescription glasses from a parcel, shipped from Cracow
Stern comes in
We need to talk
Stern
Schindler sifts through the glasses still in the box, comes up with a particular pair and holds them proudly
Not quite sure what he's seeing is real -- They arrived
They arrived, can you believe it
Stern allows himself a smile, a rare thing for him
Schindler carefully slips the new glasses onto the accountant's face
He looks around the clinic, Stern, eventually settling on Emilie, crystal clear, standing near a picture on the wall which, in other circumstances, he'd find less than reassuring: Jesus, his heart exposed and in flames
-  - In a quiet corner of the clinic, Schindler concentrates on the disquieting news Stern has brought him: We've received a complaint from the Armaments Board
very angry complaint
The artillery shells, the tank shells, rocket casings -- apparently all of them -- have failed quality-control tests
Schindler nods soberly
Then dismisses the problem with a shrug
Well, that's to be expected
They have to understand
These are start- up problems
This isn't pots and pans, this is a precise business
'll write them a letter
They're withholding payment
Well, sure
So would
So would you
wouldn't worry about it
We'll get it right one of these days
But Stern is worried about it
There's a rumor you've been going around miscalibrating the machines
(Schindler doesn't deny it) don't think that's a good idea
(pause) No
Stern slowly shakes his head 'no
' They could close us down
Schindler eventually nods, in agreement it seems
All right
Call around, find out where we can buy shells and buy them
We'll pass them off as ours
Stern's not sure he sees the logic
Whether the shells are manufactured here or elsewhere, they'll still eventually reach their intended destination, into the hearts and heads of Germany's enemies
know what you're saying, but don't see the difference
You don't
do
see a difference
You'll lose money
That's one difference
Fewer shells will be made
That's another difference
The main one
The only one Schindler cares about
Silence
Then: Stern, if this factory ever produces a shell that can actually be fired
'll be very unhappy
- nineteen year old boy with his hands in the air stands terrified before Commandant Liepold and the revolver he wields
Workers, trying to reduce the likelihood of getting hit by a stray bullet when Liepold fires on the boy -- which seems a certainty -- scramble out of the way
(
) Hey
Liepold swings the gun around at the voice, pointing it for a moment at Schindler, who is striding toward him, then aims the barrel back at the boy's head, and yells -- Department  does not forbid my presence on the factory floor
That is a lie
He waves a document at Schindler, throws it at him
Schindler doesn't bother picking it up
Instead, pointing at the boy, he yells to Liepold -- Shoot him
Shoot him
Liepold is so startled by the command, he doesn't shoot
He doesn't lower the gun, though, either
Shoot him without a hearing
Come on
His finger is on the trigger, Liepold is torn, frustrated, hating the situation he has created
As the moments without a blast stretch out, both and Schindler begin to settle down
He sabotaged the machine
Schindler glances to the boy
Then at the silent Hilo beside him
Part of it is blackened from an electrical fire
To the boy, concerned -- The machine's broken
The boy, too terrified to speak, nods
The prisoner is under the jurisdiction of Section
'll preside over the hearing
But the machine
Liepold glances to him
He seems almost distraught by the destruction of the machine, Schindler
The machine is under the authorization of the Armaments Inspectorate will preside over the hearing
Liepold isn't sure that's correct, but he has no documentation, at least not on him, to refute it
- In the machine-tool section, a "judicial table" has been set up
At it sit Schindler, Liepold, two other  officers, and an attractive German girl, a stenographer
The "saboteur," the boy, Janek, stands before the court
'm unfamiliar with the Hilo machines
don't know why  was assigned there
Commandant Liepold was watching me trying to figure it out
switched it on and it blew up
didn't do anything
All did was turn it on
Gone tonight is Schindler's usual shop-floor familiarity
He studies the boy solemn-faced
If you're not skilled at armaments work, you shouldn't be here
'm a lathe operator
Schindler dismisses the defensive comment with a wave of his hand and gets up
He comes around and paces slowly before the boy
Eventually, Janek dares to speak again -- Sir
Schindler glances up at him distractedly
did adjust the pressure controls
Schindler stops, looks to the panel, and back to the boy
What
know that much about them
Somebody had set the pressure controls wrong
had to adjust -- Schindler slams the back of his hand so hard across Janek's face, the boy almost falls
He's stunned
So are the others at the table
They've never seen such violence from the Direktor
He roars -- The stupidity of these people wish they were capable of sabotaging a machine
Schindler's hand comes up again and Janek recoils, expecting another blow
Schindler manages to hold it
Get him out of my sight
guard escorts the prisoner away
The panel members glance among themselves
Is that it
Schindler faces them and groans in dismay
'  - Liepold at his desk, typing again
This time there is no doubt he is composing a letter denouncing Schindler
-  - Schindler and Emilie, her arm in his, stand around like unwanted guests at the party
They probably are
Him anyway
The other guests include local politicians who fought and failed to keep his camp out of Brinnlitz
Whenever his glance meets one of theirs, they smile tightly
(to Emilie) Isn't this nice
It's not at all nice
He feels out of place, a feeling he's not accustomed to
Fortunately, a man in uniform, someone Schindler can relate to, approaches cheerfully, his hand outstretched
Oskar, good of you to come
Are you kidding,  never miss a party
Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie
How do you do
You have a lovely home
It is nice
Big
The man lives well
Thank you
need a drink
Oh, God, you don't have a drink
(to Emilie) Wine
She nods
Schindler goes off in search of the bartender
Rasch watches after him
Your husband's a very generous man
(wry) He's always been
'  -  - Rasch and Schindler sharing cognac in the privacy of the Police Chief's study
Beyond the closed doors, the party continues, the sounds filtering in
need guns
Rasch calmly nurses his drink, his eyes revealing nothing of what's going on behind them, except that the statement requires some elaboration
One of these days the Russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate
'd like the chance to defend myself
'd like my wife to have that chance
My civilian engineers
My secretary
(pause; then, philosophically) We're losing the war, aren't we
It kind of looks that way
(blithely) Pistols
Pistols, rifles, carbines
(long pause) 'd be grateful
Rasch smiles faintly
Yes, he's familiar, as are officials throughout much of Europe, with the gratitude of Oskar Schindler
-   - Poldek Pfefferberg holds up a pistol, feels its weight, points it
(calmly) Careful
Pfefferberg smiles, lowers the gun, kneels beside an open crate of weapons: a couple of revolvers and rifles, an old carbine
- From high above the factory, Stern can be seen among the machines talking with a worker
The man points up and returns to his work
Stern stares up, puzzled
He locates a ladder that connects the shop-floor to a series of overhead planks and, with trepidation, climbs
He reaches a shaky landing high above the machines, navigates the primitive catwalks with great care, comes to a large water tank near the workshop ceiling
Stern
Above the rim of the tank, amid rising steam, Schindler's head appears
Then disappears
Stern climbs a set of rungs on the tank, reaches the top and finds inside, lolling in the steaming water, Schindler and the blonde stenographer from the trial
Excuse me
Neither Schindler nor the blonde seems the least bit embarrassed
Only Stern
He tries hard to pretend the girl isn't there, but he just can't
'll talk to you later
No, no, what, what is it
Schindler floats over closer to him, waits for him to report whatever it is he has come to report, leans closer
Finally, quietly -- Do you have any money  don't know about
Hidden away someplace
Schindler thinks long and hard
No
Silence except for the gently lapping water
Half-joking -- Why, am  broke
Stern glances away, doesn't answer, just stares off
And a slight, slight smile, a gambler's philosophical smile upon being purged of his wealth, appears on Schindler's face
- In the distance, a lone boxcar, stark against the winter landscape
There are patches of snow on the ground
cold wind blows through bare trees
(
) Poldek
-   - Tight on Poldek Pfefferberg's eyes behind a welder's mask
He turns from his work to the voice, welding torch in his hand
- The torch firing at ice as hard as metal, blue flame, white steam
Pfefferberg's eyes behind the mask again, concentrating
Around the abandoned boxcar, in the gruesome cold, stand Schindler, Emilie, a doctor, some workers and some  guards, watching, waiting
Pfefferberg steps back
Sledge hammers pound at locks
Hands pull at levers
The doors begin to slide
Out of darkness, from inside the boxcar as the doors slide open, Schindler's face is revealed, tight
He stares for an interminable moment before walking slowly away
Inside the boxcar is a tangle of limbs, a pyramid of corpses, frozen white
From a distance, a tableau: the boxcar, the workers and guards and Emilie outside it, Schindler, off to himself several steps away, all of them still as statues
-   - Beyond a country church, among the stone markers of a small cemetery, walk Schindler and a priest
It's been suggested  cremate them in my furnaces
As a Catholic  will not
As a human being  will not
The priest nods; he seems relatively empathic
He offers an alternative -- There's an area beyond the church reserved for the burial of suicides
Maybe  can convince the parish council to allow them to be buried there
These aren't suicides
The priest knows that
But he also knows that the provisions of Canon Law regarding who can and cannot be buried in consecrated ground are narrow
These are victims of a great murder
- In a corner of the factory, workers hammer at pine lumber
They are building coffins
- As workers harness horses to carts, others hoist the coffins into them
Schindler is there, watching
He glances up at one of the guard towers, expecting, perhaps, to be felled by a bullet
- Beyond the wire, Rabbi Levartov leads the horse-drawn carts
Around him walk a minyan -- a quorum of ten males necessary for the rite
few guards lag behind
-   - Work continues, but it's apparent in their eyes they are only physically here; in spirit they are all walking alongside the carts, one great moral force
The roar of a machine suddenly, inexplicably, dies
Then another
And another
Schindler, standing at the main power panel, pulls the last of the switches, and the factory plunges into absolute silence
- Just beyond the perimeter of the Catholic cemetery, the minyan quickly and quietly recites Kaddish over the dead as their coffins are lowered into individual graves
Then, there is only a low breathing of wind
- Amon Goeth, in civilian clothes, emerges from a car
His eyes, sallow from inadequate sleep, sweep across the fortified compound with envy
It's a nice place Oskar's got here
-   -   - Stern, at a window, stares down at Goeth beside his car
Softly, gravely -- What's he doing here
Schindler appears beside Stern, glances down
He's lost weight, Goeth
The old suit he wears seems too big for him
Alone down there he seems disoriented
Probably looking for a handout
- Workers glance up at a horrible apparition from the pit of their foulest dreams -- Amon Goeth crossing through the factory
Schindler, his arm around the killer's shoulder as if he were a long lost brother, leads him across the shop-floor, proudly pointing out to him the huge thundering Hilo machines
,   - Schindler takes an old suitcase from his office closet, sets it on his desk, snaps it open revealing clothes, Goeth's uniforms, his medals
The ex-Oberstrumfuhrer touches the fabric gently, then glances up gratefully to his friend
Thank you
-   - Beyond the frosted glass of Schindler's office door, Stern can see the wavering forms of the two Nazi Party members sharing cognac and stories
- Warmed by cognac and friendship, Goeth comes through the factory again carrying the suitcase, Schindler at his side, steering him to some degree
Goeth's hand comes up to his cheek as if to brush away a bothersome fly
But it isn't a fly
One of the workers has spit on him
He turns in disbelief
Silence as his hand drops to his side, to the holster he forgets isn't there
He glances around for  guards
who aren't there
He looks to Schindler, thoroughly confused, and whispers -- Where are the guards
The guards aren't allowed on the factory floor
They make my workers nervous
Goeth stares at him bewildered
Then again at the worker who spit
Then at other workers, the resolve in their eyes
They know he has no power here, and sense he has no power anywhere
His own eyes drift to a woman with yarn in her lap, knitting needles in her hands
Is this a dream
'll discipline him later
Schindler good-naturedly throws an arm around Goeth's shoulder and leads him away
The workers watch as the two Germans disappear out the factory doors
'  - guard slowly turns the dial of a radio, finding and losing in static several different voices in several languages, none of them lasting more than a moment
Depression hangs over the barracks
Most of the guards are straining to hear the news they've been fearing for some time now, some on their bunks just staring, one at a window peering out at the black face of a forest as if expecting, at any moment, to see Russian or American troops appear
'  -   - Another radio
Workers, like the guards, straining to hear
The dial finds, faint, mired in static, the idiosyncratic voice of Winston Churchill
'  -   - Schindler on Liepold's doorstep
The two men considering each other across the threshold
Radio static filters out from Liepold's room
The word "Eisenhower" cuts through before the speaker's voice is buried again
It's time the guards came into the factory
He turns and walks away
- All twelve hundred workers and all the guards are gathered for the first time on the factory floor
Tension and uncertainty surround them
It's ominously quiet
Then -- The unconditional surrender of Germany has just been announced
At midnight tonight the war is over
It is not his intention to elicit celebration
Indeed, his words, echoing and fading in the factory, echo the doubts they all feel
Tomorrow, you'll begin the process of looking for survivors of your families
In many cases you won't find them
After six long years of murder, victims are being mourned throughout the world
Not by Untersturmfuhrer Liepold
He stands with his men, dying to lift his rifle and fire
We've survived
Some of you have come up to me and thanked me
Thank yourselves
Thank your fearless Stern, and others among you, who, worrying about you, have faced death every moment
(glancing away) Thank you
He's looking at the guards, thanking them, which thoroughly confuses the workers
Just when they thought they knew where his sentiments lay, he's thanking guards
You've shown extraordinary discipline
You've behaved humanely here
You should be proud
Or is he attempting to adjust reality, to destroy the  as combatants, to alter the self-image of both the guards and the prisoners
Moving across the  men's faces, they remain inscrutable
Schindler turns his attention back to the workers, and, not at all like a confession, but rather like simple statements of fact: 'm a member of the Nazi party
'm a munitions manufacturer
'm a profiteer of slave labor, 'm a criminal
At midnight, you will be free and  will be hunted
(pause) 'll remain with you until five minutes after midnight After which time, and  hope you'll forgive me, have to flee
That worries the workers
Whenever he leaves, something terrible always seems to happen
In memory of the countless victims among your people,  ask us to observe three minutes of silence
In the quiet, in the silence, drifting slowly across the faces of the workers -- the elderly, the lame, teenagers, wives beside husbands, children beside their parents, families together -- it becomes clear, if it wasn't before, that both as a prison and a manufacturing enterprise, the Brinnlitz camp has been one long sustained confidence game
Schindler has never stood still so long in his life
He does now, though, framed by his giant Hilo machines, silent at the close of the noisiest of wars, his head bowed, mourning the many dead
When he finally does look up he sees that he is the last to do so
The faces, few of which he recognizes, are all looking at him
He turns to speak to the guards along the wall again
know you've received orders from our Commandant -- which he has received from his superiors -- to dispose of the population of this camp
Apprehension spreads across the factory like a wave
Pfefferberg tightens his grip on the pistol under his coat
His ragtag irregulars do the same, the rest of their ersatz "arsenal" concealed behind a machine
To the guards: Now would be the time to do it
They're all here
This is your opportunity
The guards hold their weapons, as they have from the moment they arrived here tonight, at attention, waiting it seems, to be given the official order from their Commander, Liepold, who appears ready to give it
Or
(he shrugs) you could leave
And return to your families as men instead of murderers
Long, long silence
Finally, one of the guards slowly lowers his rifle, breaks ranks and walks away
Then another
And another
And another
Another
When the last is gone, the workers consider Liepold
He appears more an oddity than a threat
He is more an oddity than a threat
And he knows it
He turns and leaves
- watchtower
Abandoned
The perimeter wire
No sentries
The guard barracks
Deserted
The  is long gone
-   - Schindler and Emilie emerge from his quarters, each carrying a small suitcase
In the dark, some distance away from his Mercedes, stand all twelve hundred workers
As Schindler and his wife cross the courtyard to the car, Stern and Levartov approach
The rabbi hands him some papers
We've written a letter trying to explain things
In case you're captured
Every worker has signed it
Schindler sees a list of signatures beginning below the typewritten text and continuing for several pages
He pockets it, this new list of names
Thank you
Stern steps forward and places a ring in Schindler's hand
It's a gold band, like a wedding ring
Schindler notices an inscription inside it
It's Hebrew
It says, 'Whoever saves one life, saves the world
' Schindler slips the ring onto a finger, admires it a moment, nods his thanks, then seems to withdraw
(to himself) could've got more out
Stern isn't sure he heard right
Schindler steps away from him, from his wife, from the car, from the workers
(to himself) could've got more
if 'd just
don't know, if 'd just could've got more
Oskar, there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you
Look at them
He can't
If 'd made more money
threw away so much money, you have no idea
If 'd just
There will be generations because of what you did
didn't do enough
You did so much
Schindler starts to lose it, the tears coming
Stern, too
The look on Schindler's face as his eyes sweep across the faces of the workers is one of apology, begging them to forgive him for not doing more
This car
Goeth would've bought this car
Why did  keep the car
Ten people, right there, ten more could've got
(looking around) This pin -- He rips the elaborate Hakenkreus, the swastika, from his lapel and holds it out to Stern pathetically
Two people
This is gold
Two more people
He would've given me two for it
At least one
He would've given me one
One more
One more person person, Stern
For this
One more could've gotten one more person didn't
He completely breaks down, weeping convulsively, the emotion he's been holding in for years spilling out, the guilt consuming him
They killed so many people
(Stern, weeping too, embraces him) They killed so many people
From above, from a watchtower, Stern can be seen down below, trying to comfort Schindler
Eventually, they separate, and Schindler and Emilie climb into the Mercedes
It slowly pulls out through the gates of the camp
And drives away
- panzer emerges from the treeline well beyond the wire of the camp and just sits there growling like a beast
Suddenly it fires a shell at nothing in particular, at the night -- an exhibition of random spite -- then turns around and rolls back into the forest
-   - From a watchtower, a couple of workers, having witnessed the tank's display of impotent might, can make little sense of it
Below, many of the workers mill around the yard, waiting to be liberated
No one seems to know what else to do
- Some Czech partisans emerge from the forest
They come down the hill and casually approach the camp
Reaching the wire, they're met by Pfefferberg and some other workers, rifles slung over their shoulders
Through the fence -- It's all over
We know
(pause) So what are you doing
You're free to go home
When the Russians arrive
Until then we're staying here
The partisan shrugs, Suit yourself, and wanders back toward the trees with his friends
- Five headlights appear out of the night, five motorcycles marked with the  Death's-head insignia
They turn onto the road leading to the camp gate and park, the riders shutting off the engines
Hello
Shapes materialize out of the darkness within the camp
Several armed and dangerous Jews
-  - As the cyclists fill their tanks with gasoline borrowed from the camp, the workers keep their rifles pointed at them
The in charge lines the gas cans neatly back up against the wire
Thank you very much
He climbs onto his motorcycle
The others climb onto theirs
And drive away
- lone Russian officer on horseback, tattered coat, rope for reins, emerges from the forest
As he draws nearer, it becomes apparent to the workers assembling on the camp yard, that the horse is a mere pony, the Russian's feet in stirrups nearly touching the ground beneath the animal's skinny abdomen
He reaches the camp, climbs easily down from the horse and, in a loud voice, addresses the hundreds of workers standing at the fence: You have been liberated by the Soviet Army
This is it
This one man
The workers wait for him to say more
He waits for them to move, to leave, to go home
Finally -- What's wrong
few of the workers come out from behind the fence to talk with him
Have you been in Poland
just came from Poland
Are there any Jews left
The Russian has to think
Eventually he shrugs, 'no,' not that he saw, and climbs back onto his pony to leave
Where should we go
don't know
Don't go east, that's for sure, they hate you there
(pause) wouldn't go west either if  were you
He shrugs and gives his little horse a kick in the ribs
We could use some food
The Russian looks confused, glances off
The quiet hamlet of Brinnlitz sits there against the mountains not half a mile away
Isn't that a town over there
Of course it is
But the idea that they could simply walk over there is completely foreign to them
The Russian rides away
- All twelve hundred of them, a great moving crowd coming forward, crosses the land laying between the camp, behind them, and the town, in front of them
Tight on the  of one of the
Tight on   rapping his
Tight on   scratching out the words, " " on a form

Tight on the face of a woman in the moving crowd

: -  (1955) street of apartment buildings in a working class neighborhood of the city
- The door to a modest apartment opens revealing Oskar Schindler
The elegant clothes are gone but the familiar smile remains
Hey, how you doing
It's Poldek Pfefferberg out in the hall
Good
How's it going
Things are great, things are great
Things don't look so great
Schindler isn't penniless, but he's not far from it, living alone in the one room behind him
What are you doing
'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink
mean where have you been
Nobody's seen you around for a while
(puzzled) 've been here
guess  haven't been out
thought maybe you'd like to come over, have some dinner, some of the people are coming over
Yeah
Yeah, that'd be nice, let me get my coat
Pfefferberg waits out in the hall as Schindler disappears inside for a minute
The legend below appears: , , Schindler reappears wearing a coat, steps out into the hall, forgets something, turns around and goes back in
,  , 1958, , He comes back out with a nice bottle of wine in his hand, and, as he and Pfefferberg disappear down the stairs together -- ' Mila's good
' She's good
' Kids are good
Let's stop at a store on the way so  can buy them something
' They don't need anything
They just want to see you
' Yeah,  know
'd like to pick up something for them
It'll only take a minute
Their voices face
Against the empty hallway appears a faint trace of the image of the factory workers, through the wire, walking away from the Brinnlitz camp
