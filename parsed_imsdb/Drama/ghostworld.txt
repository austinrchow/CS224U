Eventually we find ourselves moving down a street of two-story apartment buildings
Many of the windows are lit from within by an
As we track past at window-level we see: glum, sedated-looking  watching
An ignored runs amok behind them as a cheery commercial plays
An empty room

The room is cluttered with heaps of clothes, old records, odd knick-knacks
We see her silhouetted back as she dances along to the video while trying on a -
modern high school auditorium
Over the entrance a banner with a "Coca Cola" logo reads: "  2

She makes eye-contact with , another graduate, who is also trying to stifle her laughter

High school is like the training wheels for the bicycle of real life
It is a time for young people to explore different fields of interest and to hopefully grow from their experiences
After all, that which we learn from our mistakes can be as valuable as what we learn from our textbooks, and often we can turn the negative experiences that are common to all high-schoolers into positive steps toward personal growth and achievement
In coming to terms with my own personal setback, which 'm sure you've all heard about, 've been able to learn a lot about myself
've learned for one thing that don't need to rely on drugs and alcohol () and that 'm very lucky-that more people besides Carrie and myself weren't hurt in the accident; 've learned that 'm blessed with wonderful parents, teachers and above all the best classmates in the world -- love each and every one of you guys
() and 've learned that to get through life's obstacles you need faith, hope and, most of all, a sense of humor

Now we're the newest members of the general popuLATION
- The auditorium door opens and  emerge
Enid & Rebecca run away from the crowd, triumphantly holding rolled up diplomas
They run toward the school playground, nearly bursting with excitement over their long-awaited release
Enid stops and looks back at the school
She gives it They sit on a see-saw, out of breath
God, what a bunch of retards
thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up
know,  liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict
She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her
It's totally sickening
(she unrolls her ) Let's see if they gave me the right diploma
Enid opens hers
Instead of a diploma, it's an with a pink Post-It note on the front page
What
Oh suck my fucking dick
What
These assholes are saying that have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class
Why
Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year
didn't think that just because you get an "" that means you have to take the class over again
You loser

This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again
-  , we see the party from her : The six or seven    huddle closely together
Just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again
Unless they're in your Summer school class
Shut up
Uh oh
don't turn around
What
Why
Forget it
, an ambitious, incessantly upbeat classmate, approaches them
Oh my God, you guys
can't believe we made it
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing
So what are you guys doing this Summer
Nothing
'm going to be in this actor's workshop, and 'm hoping to start going on auditions soon
'm so excited to finally have some free time
We have to get together this summer
Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen
(spotting better people to talk to) Well, bye you guys
Melorra leaves
Since when is she an "actress"
know, she needs to die immediately
, a friendly but slightly below-average-looking guy, approaches from behind
Hey Rebecca
Oh
hi
(pause) So
we finally -- What about me
Am  not even here
Oh, hey Enid
(starting over) So
we finally made it
Yep
(awkward pause) So
where are you going to college
(before Rebecca can answer) We're not
Really
Both of you
Why not
Just because
We have other plans
guess  should have figured that you two would do something different
What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd
Well 'm going to major in Business Administration and,  think, minor in Communications
See, that's exactly the kind of thing we're trying to avoid
(pause) Todd starts to talk again but Enid has noticed something off to the side
So
-- Enid grabs Rebecca and turns her away from Todd before he can finish his sentence
Oh my god, look
Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh
How perfect
He better watch out or he'll get when he date-rapes her
Todd, forgotten, walks away
The singer wails a sappy, maudlin ballad
Enid spots , the class loser, wandering around by himself
God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again
Good
God, think about that
that's actually totally depressing
- The   is Enid and Rebecca' s hangout
50- with shaved head, and his    sit eating lunch
Enid is drawing a picture of them in her sketchbook when Rebecca arrives
Hi
Look at these people behind you
'm totally convinced they're Satanists
Why
Just look at them
turns and makes eye contact with
She calmly turns back to face Enid before cracking up
So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment
Soon
have to wait and see how this Summer class goes
Did you sign up yet
Yeah,  just picked the one that sounded the easiest
God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school
We've been waiting for this our whole life
Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want
It's such a weird feeling
know, it hasn't really hit me yet
Enter  , an obnoxious young man with a perpetual smirk
Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend
You're late, asshole
Fine, and how are you
Did you bring that tape
He puts a videotape on the table, just out of reach
You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine
did too
Tsk
You Jews are so clever with money
Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick
Hey, look, the satanists are leaving
We should follow them
As the  walk outside, they open umbrellas, even though it's a bright, sunny day
Totally
Oh my God, look
The girls get up to follow them
Enid grabs the videotape
(to John) Thanks for the tape - 'll have to pay you later, 'm broke
Hey, where are you going
Later, "Dude"
Much later
In fact, never
- Under harsh, glaring sunshine, the girls follow a half-block behind the
What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff
That lets us off the hook
- The  continue slowly along with Enid & Rebecca still following
Maybe there's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the Quality Cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us
Or maybe not
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and -- Okay, okay
- Hey, look at this
Enid points at the mini-mall in front of them
new restaurant - we see their banner: "
- 50' "
"Authentic 50's diner"
Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's
God, it's so totally pathetic
- They're in a booth looking at menus
It's a less accurate version of "Johnny Rockets"
golden oldie from the 80's plays on the jukebox
Who can forget this great hit from the 50's
feel as though 've stepped into a time warp
The  approaches
He has an ostentatious 70's-style perm
Check out the awesome "fifties" hairdo on the waiter
Hi, my name is Allen, and 'll be your waiter this afternoon
Hi, Al
Can we call you "Weird Al"
Heh heh
Our specials today are pasta Vasilio, which is a pasta salad with a light basil vinaigrette-- That was a popular dish in the 50's, huh Weird Al
imagine so
Also, we have a spinach tortellini in a ricotta sauce
Both of those are $6
95
shall  give you a few minutes to mull it over
just want an order of onion rings
might actually get the pasta special
You loser
Pasta special and an order of onion rings
Very good
Al leaves
Did you notice all those weird things on the menu
Like "The Salad Explosion"
know
and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders
" What does that even mean
- Enid spots an abandoned newspaper,   , on the adjoining table
Check out the Personals
maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us
God, this paper is so boring
Who reads all this shit
(flips through it until she gets to the Personals) Here we go
(reading) "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan , maverick Sagittarius
Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh
" You can have that one
Okay, well here's yours
(reading) "Who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken
Not this one
Stunning bod, very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer
" Gross
Al returns with their food
Can  get you ladies anything else, or are you all set
Later  might be interested in one of those far-out "mindbenders
" Al leaves
Enid goes back to the paper
Jesus
Listen to this one: "Do you remember me
Airport shuttle, June 7th
You: striking redhead with yellow dress, pearl necklace, brown shoes
was the bookish fellow in the green cardigan who helped you find your contact lens
Am  crazy, or did we have a moment
" God, that's so pathetic
bet she didn't even notice him
know
And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead
Oh, we totally have to
Enid tears out the ad and puts it in her sketchbook
of sketchbook
'   - Enid and Rebecca sit with Rebecca's grandmother  in her living room
They eat  dinners while watching Oomie's favorite  , which we hear but don't see
-  (
) So what happened next, Donna
( '
) Then  told him he'd better take out his hose and pump me
- /  (
) Don-na
(
) You guys
My car was out of gas
Enid leans toward Rebecca
(whispers) Does Oomie really like this show
(whispers) Isn't it weird
It's her favorite
Girls
Shh
Enid and Rebecca exit
'  - Rebecca looks through Enid's sketchbook while Enid fiddles with the remote, fast-forwarding through a tape in the
So what should we do
Wait
just want to see what's on this tape
What is this
dunno
John Ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that  have to fast-forward past to get to the good stuff
There's supposed to be a Don Knotts movie on here someplace
Sound of -
Rebecca glances up from the sketchbook
Wait, what is that
Enid stops fast-forwarding
We don't see the screen but we hear weird sounds like
& Enid lurches forward to avert her gaze
She clicks off the , but leaves the  on
She notices a   on a bookshelf under the television
Hey - why do you have this
You lent it to me in like tenth grade
've been looking all over for this
as she leafs through it
We see a picture of a --  with glasses
Look at how cute  am
What a little hosebag
of --  &  at a party
Look, that's back when  hated you
remember every minute of that party
(another page) There's my dad with Joanie
can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch
No, she was the second wife
The third one was the super-bitch - Maxine
(finds a picture) There
Look at her
of
What a fucking monster
Something on  catches Rebecca's eye
Oh my God
This is that comedian was telling you about
You have to see this guy -- he's the absolute worst
dead-pan comedian,  McCOBB, is doing his stand-up routine in a standard brick-wall comedy venue
He has a contrived "'m a weirdo" shtick
Just because  live with my mother people think 'm peculiar
so what if she's been dead for fifteen years
Hehn hehn
(Peter Lorre laugh) (
) God, that's barely even a joke
As  always say, take my life
please
(
) If he's supposed to be so weird, how come he's wearing Nikes
Joey McCobb, ladies and gentlemen
Joey McCobb
() Joey McCobb is our God
want to do him
bet
Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick
What are you talking about -- who
That Larry guy -- what look was he going for
gay tennis player from the forties
Fuck you
Rebecca turns the page of Enid's sketchbook to the torn-out personal ad
Hey
We forgot to call the loser
Which loser
You know, the green cardigan guy
Oh yeah
Rebecca goes to the phone and offers the receiver
You call
Why do  always have to do it
You're better at it
(as she dials) remember when  first started reading these  thought  stood for "dwarf
" (ear up to phone) What does it stand for
Shh, it's his answering machine
(pause) We hear the indistinct traces of a musical message followed by a faint Hi, it's me - your "striking blonde
" Of course  remember you
Let's get together for lunch sometime
How about Friday at one o'clock
Why don't you meet me at my favorite restaurant, "Wowsville"
It's in the mall on Century Parkway
'll see you there, darling
and be sure to wear that sexy green cardigan
As Enid hangs up they both start laughing
- franchise convenience store with a western motif
- , 19, is taking his apron off as his , a humorless Greek immigrant, counts out the cash register
Cheerful Muzak plays
What you think you doing
You still got five minutes left on you shift
Enid (wearing wraparound shades) & Rebecca enter
Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder
Look,  already told you 'm not going to give you a ride
What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"
Look, 'll be done in a minute
Just wait outside
'm afraid  don't understand simply wish to know -- () The flavors we're featuring this week, in addition to old favorites chocolate and vanilla, are Six-Gun Strawberry, Wild Cherry Round-up, and Ten Gallon Tangerine
don't believe  care for any of those
Rebecca giggles
customer, , enters: a lowly specimen with bad hair-cut, mustache, and jail-house tattoos, wearing filthy designer jeans and no shirt
Hey, Josh
need two packs of smokes
'm on a double shift tonight
fuckin' sixteen hours, man
Doug brings a 40-ouncer to the counter
Josh has two packs of Newports waiting for him
Hey, and gimme six of these beef jerkys too - 'm hungry enough to chew the crotch out of a rag doll
Doug pays
Hey
told you: No shirt, no service
(as he leaves) Fuck you, man
So Josh
Look, can we talk in a minute
'm almost done
Enid looks at herself in the security mirror
She takes off her hat and messes up her hair
She then takes off her shades and replaces them with her standard horn-rims
(nudging Enid, points outside) Look at this
Outside we see Doug practicing with nunchuks and drinking a beer
Heavy metal music blares from his car radio
The sees this and goes out to yell at him
You get out of here
Josh joins Enid & Rebecca on the other side of counter
That guy rules
Who, Doug
He spends more time here than  do
So Josh, will you give us a ride
Please
Pretty please
It's going to be super fun
No
Please Josh
Forget it, there's no way
find some other poor sucker to abuse
'  - Josh is driving, chauffeur-like, with the two girls relaxing in the back seat
Why do you even need a ride
You could walk there in two minutes
It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you
Enid and Rebecca giggle
So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us
He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody
God,  think Josh is too mature for us
know, look at the way he drives
he's like an old man
Yeah, Josh, c'mon
- Their car accelerates
- 12:35
The three of them are seated at a corner booth
song from any decade other than the 50's  on the jukebox enters
Look, maybe that's him
It's still twenty-five minutes early
Aren't there a million places like this
This is the ultimate
It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners
So, where's "Weird Al"
He's back there
can see his hair bobbing up and down
want to "make love" to him
'm going to tell him you said that
approaches with menus
So nice to see you again, ladies
Hey, Weird Al, there's something my friend wants to tell you -- She says she wants to
Rebecca puts her hand over Enid's mouth
: ,
:   slowly sweeping
: Enid, Rebecca & Josh
They're now eating: ten minutes have passed, it's 12:45
So Josh
Becky and  are trying to figure out what makes you tick
Tell us about your political beliefs
laughs
Yeah, right
No, 'm serious
Give us your whole basic philosophy in a nutshell
Oh my God, look, that's got to be him
enters
Is he wearing a green cardigan
What exactly is a cardigan anyway
The  joins a friend
That's not him
Jesus, stop freaking me out
In answer to your question,  suppose endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form
figured something like that
Oh my God
They see a somewhat funny-looking guy in his late 30's, wearing a green cardigan, , enter
Enid and Rebecca hunch down in their seats
It's obviously him
can't believe it
Seymour sits down and looks around
Weird Al brings a menu
:   bringing his milkshake
Ten more minutes have passed, it's 12:55
What's going on now
What's he doing
Oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk
(bursting her bubble) It's a vanilla milkshake
Fifteen more minutes have passed - it's 1:10
Seymour looks around, still hopeful
His date is now What's he doing now
He's still just sitting there
God, this is totally unbearable
agree
wish  could see him
Go ahead and look, but don't make it too obvious
Rebecca turns around and pretends to look past Seymour
It's now 1:30
His date is 30
Seymour gets up and walks sadly towards the cashier (Weird Al)
Do you think he knows
dunno
They watch him leave
Enid goes up to pay the bill while Josh and Rebecca go outside
Hey Weird Al, did that guy say anything to you before he left
Not a thing
Enid goes back to the table to leave a tip, two dollars
Al passes behind her
(cheerfully professional despite her abuse) Thank you and come again
Enid hesitates, overcome with guilt
She glances back at Al, then digs every penny out of her pocket (about seven dollars in coins and wadded up bills) and adds it to his tip
- The trio drive in silence
Suddenly, an extra-wide pick-up vrooms past Josh, cutting off the driver () next to him
bobs violently as he screams silent obscenities
Jesus, look at this guy
Oh my God, that's
Are you sure
Totally
Look
:  really having a fit now
Once it's out of his system, he reverts to an amiable poker-face
He's insane
We should follow him home
Forget it
Come on, Josh
don't you want to see where he lives
No
But this guy is like a one-of-kind, rare butterfly, and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat
You need counseling
'  - Several minutes have passed
Seymour parks
God, he lives right in our neighborhood
Seymour gets out and disappears up the steps of his building
He doesn't even look that bummed out, really
know
wouldn't you be totally pissed off
This kind of thing must happen to him all the time
- : grainy & video footage
The  travels up a shadowy flight of stairs
We hear , a rhythmic , and a deranged '  ("")
' (cheap echo effect) Returning to the house of my Fatherfatherfatherfather
The  reaches the top of the stairs, we see a door that slowly  open
We move into the room beyond, it's decorated with stuff from the 50's and a giant crucifix
We a televangelist's sermon
We   on a little girl's doll
Very slowly a '  reaches for the doll and drags it into the shadows
The hand throws the now mutilated doll into a toilet; water and blood swirl around
We see grainy footage (shot off of ) of Christians angrily picketing an abortion clinic
come up: - The lights go on, the  ends and the monitor is shut off
There are about a dozen students, mostly pimply 14-year-old boys, a few 14-ish girls, and Enid, dressed in schoolgirl outfit
The teacher,  , addresses the class
That piece is entitled "Mirror/Father/Mirror
"  like to show it to people 'm meeting for the first time because it says so much about who  am and what it feels like to inhabit my specific skin
And this is exactly what 'm hoping to get from each of you over the course of this Summer: a picture of your own self-exploration
My own background is in video and performance art, but 'm hoping that doesn't influence you and that you'll find your own ways of externalizing the internal
At the end of the Summer, this class has been invited, along with several others in the area, to participate in a show of High-School art at the Neighborhood Activity Center
The title of the show will be "Brotherhood and Community: Art as Dialogue
"  think the "Brotherhood" theme ties in nicely with the theme of self-discovery that 'd like to emphasize in this class
Are there any questions so far
(she's completely lost them) Great
'  - Enid and Rebecca stand in front of Seymour's apartment
This is way too creepy
He won't see us
we'll just stalk him from a distance
'm afraid if  see him, 'll start feeling really bad again
pause
So what should we do
We can't just hide all day waiting for him to come out
'  - There are three mail slots
Enid pulls the mail out of the first one
We see   , and This is girl mail
She grabs the mail out of
This is all computer catalogues and stuff
Rebecca is looking at the mail from
The
Fields Fan Club Newsletter
(she flips through the mail) Oh my God, The National Psoriasis Foundation
Bingo
She shoves back the contents of slot number two and grabs the mail from Rebecca
We hear   around the corner
Wait
Do you hear that
Enid jams the mail back in the slot in a panic
Shit
They slowly walk around the bushes toward the voices
& '   - They see the  , in progress
They've all spotted each other
What should we do
What if he recognizes us
Come on, it's too late now
middle-aged  browses with little enthusiasm as Enid & Rebecca tentatively approach
Enid spots a taxidermy piece near Joe
Ew, look at this
Gross
think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth
Ew, it's like some gross rat
(hardly looking up from ) It's a mongoose
Mm
what
mongoose
they eat snakes
you never heard of a mongoose
That's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy
Nobody alive today knows how to do work like that
(looking underneath it) How much is this
Umm
That's not officially for sale
might have to hang onto that for the time being
Joe shuts off the
He turns to the girls, not wanting to lose the rapport he's established with two potential customers
So, are you looking for anything in particular
There's a lot of other stuff in storage
He picks up a plastic Casio-type guitar/keyboard (a child's toy) and starts noodling pre-programmed rock licks
Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to you
Absolutely no practice necessary
You shread like a giant
Just press a button
That's okay
She notices several modern jazz LPs on Joe's table
Do you have any other old records besides these
Seymour does
Who does
Him
Seymour
He's the man with the records
Enid glances at Rebecca and mouths the implausible name: "Seymour
" Rebecca snorts, unable to control her laughter, and turns away from the table
Enid keeps her cool
Do you have any old Indian records
Indian records
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music
don't have anything after about 1935
may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale
don't really collect "foreign
" Enid drifts over and begins thumbing through a box of 78s
Those are all 78s
Can you play 78s
Sure
Wait, maybe not 78s, but can play regular records
He points her to a nearby box of LPs
There's some good stuff in here
do you like old music
Sure,  guess
Well there's a few choice LPs in here that re-issue some really great old blues stuff
Rebecca tugs on Enid's sleeve
Enid gets free and continues looking through the records
She stops on one with an especially wacky cover
Is this one any good
Nah, it's not so great
Here's the one 'd recommend
He pulls out a bland-looking record: "' , " Rebecca shifts impatiently behind her
This track alone by Memphis Minnie is worth about $500 if you have the original 78
She was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived, and a great singer and songwriter as well
know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue
Wow
Rebecca snorts at Enid's over-exuberance
Enid kicks her
How much is it
dollar seventy-five
Okay
She pays him
If you don't like it bring it back for a refund
We're here every Saturday
He puts the record into a bag
'm sure it's fine
- Enid & Rebecca sit in their usual booth
Rebecca is reading That was truly pathetic
know
still can't get over that his name was "Seymour
" Rebecca starts looking through the
She takes a pen out of her purse
He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint
God, these apartments are super expensive
It was so cute how he had his own little bags
thought  was going to start crying
Do you think they're gay
What about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"
Oh yeah
He should totally just kill himself
Hey, here's one (circles it) Oh wait
(crosses it out) you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats
dunno
kind of like him
He's the exact opposite of everything really hate
In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool
That guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"
This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen
Yeah, but
you know what  mean
Not really
Forget it,  can't explain it
Awkward silence
Melorra enters
Oh my god, what are you guys doing here
What are you doing here, Melorra
My acting workshop is across the street from here
'm just on my break
Well, we won't keep you
love this place
it's so - you know, "funky
" Enid and Rebecca look at each other
What are you guys up to
We're looking for an apartment
God how cool
Where are you moving
We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking
Somewhere downtown
God that's so exciting
(looks at clock) Oops,  should go
Bye you guys
Call me
Melorra leaves quickly
"Funky"
What, is she black now
They watch her cross the street - she's dressed in expensive "casual" clothes with a fancy backpack
've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies
What are you talking about
That's who people want to rent to
It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich
All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal
it'll be fun
You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you
Just promise you'll do it
Okay, okay,  promise
Jesus, you're out of your mind
'  - Loud water running;   blares from adjoining bedroom as Enid, her head in the sink, sings along, making up her own words
As she straightens  , we see that she's dyed her hair green
She grabs a towel and heads into the bedroom
'  - Her  enters with a mixing bowl, oblivious to the green hair and loud music
(over music) Have you seen my blue spatula
Nope
What are you making, pancakes
Not if  don't find that goddamn spatula
Dad leaves
Enid messes up her hair in different ways while singing along to the tape and looking at herself in the mirror
Rebecca opens the door and stands in the doorway
(disdainful) When did you do that
Enid turns around, startled, but instantly regains helps composure
What
How long have you been standing there
/   - Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade
Fuck you, bitch
They walk past a sad-looking     , in a distinctive old building, that looks as if it's been there forever
They stop and peer through the window
We still have to go in there sometime
It's always closed
bet they have tons of incredible shoes hidden in the back
They continue walking
Hey look, it's the pants
We see a pair of discarded jeans on the sidewalk
Where are we going
Let's go hassle Josh
"Hassle"
They see a -  dressed in a shabby threadbare suit and hat sitting at what was once a bus stop
The rusty sign has a red sticker on it that says "No longer in service
" There he is
As always
Waiting for the bus that never comes
wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or -- Why don't you ask him
Enid sits next to
Rebecca stands behind the bench, taken aback that Enid is going to end the long standing speculation
Hi
what's your name
(looks at watchless wrist, then down the street) Norman
are you waiting for a bus
Yes
hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago
There are no buses on this street
You don't know what you're talking about
'   - Enid & Rebecca are on the outside porch/walkway on the second floor of Josh's building
Enid  on his pasteboard door; the windows  with each hollow
& He's probably in there jerking off
'll bet he never jerks off
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that
Should we leave a note
Enid finds a piece of paper - the back of a pizza flyer
Do you have a pen
She writes, while Rebecca looks over her shoulder
"Dear Josh
We came by to fuck you but you didn't answer the door
Therefore you are gay
Signed, Tiffany and Amber
" You're not really going to leave that are you
Enid pushes the note over his doorknob
--  - Why are we going here
hate this place
It'll only take a second
--  - They enter
We see racks of books-with titles like "Make Explosives At Home
" Rebecca walks over to the magazine rack
#1 -- 'm telling you, you're wrong -- carpet beetles are the only way to get the flesh off a corpse
Boiling is strictly for amateurs
Don't you creeps ever talk about anything nice
Don't you ever talk about fluffy kittens or the Easter Bunny
#1 Look who's talking - little miss badass
#2 Yeah, nice outfit - who are you supposed to be, Cyndi Lauper
Blow me, doofus
John Ellis emerges from the back and begins to unload a box of books onto the shelves
He stops and looks at Enid
Didn't they tell you
Tell me what
Punk rock is over
know it's over, asshole,  -- If you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what 'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside
That's not even -- Yeah yeah yeah
Do you have my money
She wads up a twenty-dollar bill and throws it at him
Oh, how "punk
" That tape sucked, by the way
'm so sorry if you were offended
He heads toward the back room with the empty box
Go die, asshole
Get a job
He exits
Rebecca walks over to Enid
What was that all about
It's not like 'm some modern Punk dickhead
It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but  guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it
didn't get it either
Everybody's too stupid
' / - Enid dejectedly enters and heads straight for the bathroom
She rummages through a cabinet until she finds the right box (black hair dye)
She wets her hair, then goes into the bedroom and mechanically turns on her boom box
The punk rock song we heard earlier plays
She yanks out the tape and flings it away
She skims through her records and CDs, dismissing them all
She notices Seymour's bag in the corner
She takes out the record and puts it on
The first tune is an upbeat instrumental number
She returns to the bathroom
Several minutes pass
begins on the
She (and we) slowly begin to take notice
It's a strange, haunting old
We see that the tune has struck a nerve
'  - The song continues
Enid sits in her bean-bag chair
Her hair is now dyed back to black
As the song ends, she picks up the needle and starts it again
& '   - Yeah, it took a while before  got a chance to play it, but when  heard that song it was like -- So you really liked it
Yeah, there's some really rare performances
You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh
Yeah, that's good too
the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" --  mostly just keep playing that one over and over
Do you have any other records like that
The Skip James record
Yeah, that's a masterpiece
There are no other records like that
actually have the original 78 of it in my collection
It's one of maybe five known copies
(nearly sincere) Wow
Do you want to see it
can run upstairs and get it
Yeah, sure,  guess
(to Joe, he always says this when he leaves his table) Watch my stuff
Seymour exits
An uncomfortable pause as Enid stands at the table
She touches the mongoose's tooth
(not looking up) You still interested in that
thought it wasn't for sale
'm thinkin' maybe  could let it go
It's kind of falling apart
Seymour returns with the 78, holding it like a precious object
Here it is
It's only about  minus and has an incipient lam crack, but plays decent as  recall
Seymour passes the 78 to Enid who follows suit and holds it carefully by the edges
Wow
Enid pretends to drop the record
Oops
dropped it
Hey,  was only kidding
She hands the record back to Seymour, who's shaken and embarrassed
Jesus, Seymour
are you all right
- Starts with a   a wall of unimpressive high school art: dumb drawings of fighting Chuck Norris-types, traced centerfolds, highly sexualized horses, etc
And, on a table, a wire sculpture made from two coathangers
'm not going to start a discourse on the subject of "good" art vs
"bad" art; these judgments are for each person to make on his own merely want to help each of you find the best way to look within yourselves the best key to your particular lock
Last week  asked you to-try and create a piece of artwork that responds to something that you have strong feelings about
Enid enters late and puts her sketchbook on the table
And it looks like we have some really interesting work up here
Roberta peruses some of the art, then points to a very violent drawing
What can you tell, us about your piece
uh
(struggles to read signature) Phillip
(very stupid and nervous) Uh
it's uh
it's about The Mutilator
My goodness
It's this really great video game about a guy who kills people with a big hammer
(trying to make a joke) thought maybe this was supposed to be your father
No response from Phillip
Roberta nicks up Enid's sketchbook and leafs through it
And what can you tell us about this
(searches for name) Enid
It's sort of like a diary guess
We see several sketches, including the drawing of the Roberta shows a few pages to the class
think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves
We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class
(pause, points at ) Who is responsible for this
am
Talk to us about it
It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose
it's something  feel super-strongly about
Isn't this a wonderful piece, class
This definitely falls into that higher category of art  was speaking of earlier
glances over at Enid
Enid gives her a dirty look
" "  -
On a monitor, a generic trailer is playing
#1 Hello and welcome to Masterpiece video
How may  help you this afternoon, sir
'm looking for a copy of 8 1/2
#1 Yessir
Is it a new release, sir
No, it's the classic Italian film
#1 Let me look that up on the computer for you, sir
(  ) Yes, here it is - 9 1/2  with Mickey Rourke
It's in our "Erotic Dramas" section
No, not "9 1/2", 8 1/2 , the Fellini film
#1 'll check that for you sir
How do you spell the actor's name - ---- ---
Enid & Rebecca, dressed up in sexy outfits
How about this one
Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm
She pulls out a small porcelain figure of a with the words "Goodbye Cruel World" on the base
Ew
when did you get that
This morning at Seymour's garage sale
God, aren't you tired of Seymour yet
Rebecca picks up another tape
How about this
Forget it
'm sure it sucks
All these movies suck
An obnoxious -- tries to get his  to add another tape to their already tall stack
He stares at the video monitor
Another   reshelves videos near them
#2 (overly cheerful) Hello
How are you young ladies this evening
May  help you find a particular Masterpiece movie
No
They walk by him
Let's get out of here, this place makes me sick
We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before  start my stupid job
know a party we could go to
What
Where
It's a surprise
don't believe you
If  promise you there's really a party with a lot of guys, do you promise you'll go
& '   - depressing ' - in progress
Enid & Rebecca sit on an old sofa in the corner
Nine or ten mill about
There are some records  will pay serious money for, provided they're a sincere  plus
Other than that 'd prefer to just have them on
CDs will never have the presence of an original 78
-
digital transfer adequately mastered will sound identical to the original
Do you have a decent equalizer
have a Klipsch 2B3
Obviously the problem
You expect a ten-band equalizer to impart state of-the-art sound
Dream a little dream
etc
Enid & Rebecca are sitting nearby
totally, totally hate you
Aw c'mon, this is a fun party
: Joe stands talking to , an obnoxious, pushy, fast-talking guy who keeps eyeing Rebecca
He shovels food into his mouth as he speaks
So what's the story with the two cheerleaders over here
They're Seymour's
Seymour
You gotta be kidding me
Don't worry about it
He's not gettin' any and neither are you
(poking Joe in the chest) Let me tell ya somethin', Joe
Listen to me, Joe
you can't hit a home run without swinging the bat
Right
Gerrold walks over to where Rebecca is sitting
He sits on the arm of sofa next to her
Mind if  sit here
(staring straight ahead) Yes
Whoa, that was cold
Hey, you're okay, you're pretty sharp
So uh
hey, you're wearing a green dress - whadda you Irish
bet you're Irish
What's your name
Melorra
Melorra, listen to me - let me tell you something Melorra
you seem like an interesting chick - what are you doing hanging out with these losers here
Whaddya say you and me take off and hit some nightspots etc
etc
'll be right back, 'm gonna go get a beer
(to ) Wait
Enid goes over to the beer keg
Nearby Seymour stands talking to  - a humorless, middle-aged guy in a suit and tie who's contemptuously examining one of Seymour's 78s
but it plays like new
There's no groove wear
Oh please
It has an enlarged center hole and a hair crack
Enid approaches them
But the crack is so tight it's completely inaudible
tight hair crack is just that - a crack
don't collect cracked records
(walking away) only pay a premium for mint records Seymour, you know that
Please
What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks
didn't think you would have any interest in this get together
mean if you had told me you were coming  would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything
You're right about that
(pause) So this is your record collection
Oh God no
This is just junk  have for sale or trade
The record room is off-limits
Really
Can  see it
Yeah, well sure
you can if you want to
it's just  don't want all these guys in there at once
you know
'  - Enid & Seymour enter his inner sanctum, beverage containers in hand -- nicely-displayed old collectibles cover just about every inch of wall space
Wow
This is like my dream room
Are these all records
have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point
've tried to pare down my collection to the essential
God, look at this poster
can't believe this room
You're the luckiest guy in the world
'd kill to have stuff like this
Please
go ahead and kill me
This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me
Oh, come on
What are you talking about
You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things
You can't connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff
'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers
Enid writes her name in the dust
No you're not
You're a cool guy, Seymour
Yeah right
If 'm so cool, why haven't  had a girlfriend in four years
can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me
'm talking to you
'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute
Oh, right
No really
guarantee  could get you a date in like two seconds
Good luck
'm totally serious
Yeah, well
mean it -- You leave everything to me -- 'm going to be your own personal dating service
appreciate the offer but you really don't -- Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy
Jesus
That's very nice of you Enid but  -  really -- - As Enid and Seymour walk
20-ish secretary-type passes
What about her
Would you go out with her
don't know, what kind of question is that
mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me
But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her
really didn't get a good look at her
breasty, overweight 40-year-old walks by
Okay, what about this one
Are you into girls with big tits
(embarrassed) Jesus
'mon Seymour, 'm trying to collect data here
Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl
'm just not one of those guys who has a "type"
Every guy has a type
(he doesn't really mean this) mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive
They walk by "the pants
" Hey look, there's Norman
He's sitting as before at the defunct bus stop
Hi Norman
Norman nods politely
Seymour looks quizzically at Enid
/  - They're in another part of town near
We need to narrow this down somehow
we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests
Maybe  don't want to meet someone who shares my interests
hate my interests
Where can  go to meet the exact opposite of myself
Yeah yeah yeah
Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance
(sighs) Well, let's see
guess 'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably
Let's just say "music" - that way you only use up one
(spots The Sidewinder) Wait, we have to go in here for a second
- They enter
Josh has his back to the counter as he makes a complicated frozen yogurt sundae for a little girl
Hi Josh
(without turning around) Hi
just stopped in to say hi
Yeah, well
hi
He turns around non-chalantly, holding the sundae
He looks up and sees Enid with the guy from Wowsville (Seymour)
This is my friend Seymour
Josh is startled and drops the sundae
The girl starts crying
Josh immediately starts to clean up the mess
Enid, satisfied, heads with Seymour for the door
See you later, Josh
As the door closes, we hear a familiar voice
- Enid & Seymour continue walking
(pause) So is that your boyfriend
Josh
He's nobody's boyfriend
He's just this guy that Becky and like to torture
Well are -- (interrupts suddenly) Oh my god
We have to go in here
They are in front of ', a porno shop
Yeah, sure
very funny
Please, Seymour
Becky and  have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us
Please
- 'd really rather not
We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot
don't think so
We have to
really don't think it's a good idea
Fine, 'll go by myself then
'  - Enid & Seymour enter
There are a half dozen  browsing through the videos and magazines
(whispering) Wow
Look at all these creeps
Shh
Enid runs over and grabs a -
Everyone in the store looks at them
Seymour blushes and sweats
What kind of weirdo would actually have sex with this
We have to buy this
She looks around, over-stimulated
God, this place is a total riot
She picks up a magazine
Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - isn't child pornography totally illegal
These are older women just dressed up to look young
think
a pair of -
(
) Oh my god
: She's in another part of the store near the How much are these boots
Do you have these in size five
That's the only pair of those  have right now
'm getting a new order in next week
She spots something and gasps
She yells across the store
You have to lend me the money to buy this
Everyone looks at Seymour as he sheepishly approaches
He takes out his wallet
Uh,  don't have much money with me right now
'mon, Seymour, please
Why don't you come back in two weeks - we'll be having our annual Back-to- School sale
- Rebecca is at the counter serving a long line of
We can see a sign next to the counter that reads: "Answer today's trivia question and get a free small coffee"
#1 'd like a medium latte for here
Can  get you a biscotti to go with that
#1 Just the latte
Enid is next wearing a    with devil horns
(
) Give me all your money, bitch
Where did you get that
You won't believe it
Guess
Where
Anthony's
No way
when
Just now
went with Seymour
You cunt
is in line behind Enid
He's a poodle-haired, fedora wearing eccentric in a motorized wheelchair-golf cart contraption
Excuse me -  can't read the trivia question
Enid is in the way
She reads it to him
"Where on the human body is the 'Douglas Pouch' located
" Feldman grunts and starts to tap away on his powerbook while Rebecca, rolling her eyes, goes to get his coffee of the   on his computer screen
With a few keyboard strokes he zeroes in on a schematic of the An area behind the cervix
Slightly below the uterus on a female
He takes his coffee and putters towards the door
That guy is totally amazing
He does that every single day
#2 Can  get a decaf mocha to go
Can  get you a
#2 ,  don't want a biscotti with that
#2 pays and leaves
God, how can you stand all these assholes
don't know
Some people are okay, but mostly  feel like poisoning everybody
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining
He's a total asshole
He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy
That rules
No, it doesn't
You'll see
you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos
But those are our people
Yeah, well
(pause) So when are you going to get your job
'm working on it
've got a few leads
it's just that right now have, all these projects that take up all my time
Like what
Nothing
Don't worry
promise 'll get a job next week
(pause) God,  can't believe you went to Anthony's without me
'  - Enid and her dad are eating breakfast
13"  sits on the kitchen counter behind them
(
) (sincere) Hope comes in all forms
To the endangered white stork searching for wetlands it comes in the form of a sanctuary provided by people who care
Do people care
Chevron does
That's why at Chevron we're just as concerned
Are you still looking for a job
Do you have any leads
Will you get off my back for once
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training
Look,  told you 'm not going to college
Well,  think it's good to keep all your options open
You can always enroll for the winter quarter
You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to
Look at me -- 'm not even listening to a word you're saying
Pause
Did  tell you who  ran into at the bagel place
(reading cereal box) Who
Guess
How should  know
Someone from the past
Who
Give up
Maxine
Not the Maxine
Yup
God, how horrifying
Enid and Rebecca sit in a semi-crowded college hang-out
you don't have to make a million dollars -- just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment
(thoughtful pause) wonder if  hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something
Like have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly
You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you
Or maybe
did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos
Maybe that's why we spend so much time together
You're gross
(pause) See that guy
Which one
He gives me a total boner
He's like the biggest idiot of all time
The guy, a  , walks by them with two friends
Are you guys up for some reggae tonight
Okay, you're right
(whispers) Heads up
An earnest "-"  approaches Rebecca
He hands her a flyer
Hey, my band is playing here on Friday night and uh
there's gonna be a bunch of cool bands playing and stuff and you don't have to pay if you show this flyer at the door
you should come check it out
(shyly) Thanks
(she looks away) Enid takes the flyer from Rebecca
There are a bunch of bands listed
Which one is your band
Alien Autopsy
(sarcastic) Bitchin'
(embarrassing pause; then, to Rebecca) Yeah, well
maybe 'll see you there
(pause; walks away) What a dork
You're just jealous
Yeah, right
Believe me, at this point 'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me
Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth
That's not true,  just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers
(sad pause) Sometimes  think  act so weird because 'm crazy from sexual frustration
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation
(sighs) maybe we should be lesbos
Get away from me
'  - Starts on full moon in night sky, framed right -- : a dark moonlit room
Enid lies on her stomach in bed
We to her head as though entering her thoughts, which slowly fade in:    a vertical sliver of light -- a cracked-open bathroom door
into the bathroom and see Enid taking a shower
Josh enters, dressed in a black suit, holding a large bouquet of flowers
We start again, exactly as before, only without the flowers
He starts to take off his clothes
He enters again and gets right in the shower, fully clothed
They begin to kiss
After a passionate moment, the door opens
Rebecca stands there, stunned
: We see only the slightest trace of Enid in the darkness
She sighs
- -  a charcoal portrait of
Who is this, Enid
It's supposed to be Don Knotts
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject
dunno
just like Don Knotts
see
interesting
She moves on
What do we have here, Margaret
It's a tampon in a teacup
Class
can see that
now what can you tell us about it
First of all, what kind of sculpture is this
It's a "found object"
that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art
Very good
Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent
guess  see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea  was trying to kind of confront people with this
like
This shocking image of repressed femininity
Right, exactly
think it's really a wonderful piece, Margaret
Enid gives Margaret another dirty look
This illustrates perfectly what was saying about not being afraid to use controversial imagery, class
'  - Seymour drives
Enid plays with the radio stopping on an obnoxious  Disc Jockey
comin' atchya on this beautiful evening
God, that asshole's voice is so hateful
No wonder  never listen to the radio
(shutting it off) Relax, Seymour, relax
That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it's like someone jabbing me in the face
(imitating insincere voice) comin' atchya on this beautiful evening
She changes the subject and holds up a 78 record
So, why did you bring this along
brought it for him to autograph
He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner
What an insult
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from
'm not holding my breath in that department
Seymour waits at a stop sign for two , each with  and baby carriages, to cross
What are we, in slow motion here
What are ya, hypnotized
Have some more kids, why don't you
For Christ's sake, would you move
Jesus, Seymour
- marquee reads, ":  also  " - , age 82, plays an acoustic blues number
He's good, but he's being politely ignored for the most part by the -
Most of them are more interested in a baseball game showing on a big-screen
can't believe these people
They could at least turn off their stupid sports game until he's done playing
finishes to
An
takes the mic
Let's hear it for Fred Chatman
(a little more ) Hey don't go away because we've got Blueshammer coming up in just a minute
, mid-20's, stands near their table sipping her drink
Enid nods in her direction for Seymour's benefit as if to say, "check it out
" Yes, that would certainly do
Well, offer her a seat
You want me to do it
Wait a minute
Hang on
Jesus, gotta think of something to talk to her about
No
No
Just wait here
Enid gets up before Seymour can stop her and talks to who looks back at Seymour and smiles
She goes to join him
Enid walks off in the direction of the bar, giving Seymour a "thumbs up
" Hi
Hello
Uh
that was great music, huh
(sitting down) Yeah,  just love blues
Actually, technically what he was mostly playing would more accurately be classified in the "ragtime" idiom
Although of course not in the strictest sense of the more classical ragtime piano music like that of Scott Joplin or Joseph Lamb
Authentic Blues has a more conventional twelve- bar structure in its stanzas
Oh if you like authentic blues, you've just gotta see Blueshammer
They're so great
: Enid standing alone at the bar
We see Seymour and Cute Girl from her
Her gaze drifts to the other people in the bar
the faces of all the guys and stop on a skinny, introverted-looking guy with a pool-cue
He makes a shot and instantly goes into an ostentatious cue twirling routine
Her gaze drifts on
She sees herself in a mirror behind the bar and takes off her hat reconfiguring her hair
She reaches into her purse and puts on a bulkier pair of glasses
This is interrupted by  taking the stage
Young, white, cocky, pretty boys
( ) All right people
Are you ready to Cuz we gwine play you some authentic, way-down-in-the-delta blues to rock your world
One, Two, Three
din of loud noise
immediately leaps to her feet, boogeying to the music
Several horny   press in on Seymour (who's still sitting), spilling his drink as they vie to dance with her
Seymour extricates himself from the table and walks toward the bar where Enid sits
What did you tell that girl
told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label
Jesus
'  - Now  remember why  haven't gone anywhere in months
'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there
might as well be from another planet
We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all
Look,  really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless
It's not hopeless
Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy
just can't relate to 99
9% of humanity
Yeah, well,  can't relate to humanity either, but  don't think it's totally hopeless
But it's not totally hopeless for you
've had it
don't even have the energy to try anymore
You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything  do so you don't end up like me
'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar
At least you're an interesting person
at least you're not exactly like everybody else
Hooray for me
'
- Enid walks in behind Seymour
'm not sure  have anything to drink
there might be some -- It doesn't matter, 'm not staying long
just want to make sure convince you not to give up yet
"Yet
" '  - They both have drinks now
He puts on a jazz record, an instrumental
(picks up an antique knick knack) Wow, this is so cool
If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if  get a date or not
dunno
because  can't stand the idea of a world where a guy like you can't get a date
Enid finds a  leaning in a pile of stuff against the wall in the corner
It's an old-fashioned cartoony stereotype of a black man's head, with big lips and a huge toothy smile
What the fuck, Seymour
What is this
What
Oh that
borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago
guess it's mine now
What, are you a klansman or something
Yeah, right, 'm a klansman - thanks a lot
Do you know the Cook's Chicken franchise
(quoting  commercial in deep voice) "Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's  -"
Yeah, well "Cook's" is just a made up name
When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named "The Coon Chicken Inn" -- that's an early painting of their first logo
He takes out a scrapbook
'm obsessed with all this stuff - this lost culture of the 20th century
She looks through the scrapbook - we see the Coon Chicken logo transform first into a less stereotyped black man, then into an older distinguished black chef with the logo "Cook's Chicken Inn
" Then to a white version of the same chef, followed by a female white chef, then to a streamlined 90's version
On another page is a collection of cosmetic labels tracing the design evolution of a different company
Why doesn't everybody know this
The record ends
Seymour gets up to take it off the turntable
(somewhat bitterly) It's ancient history
The same reason nobody knows about this Lionel Belasco record
He puts on another record
Actually,  was a whole lot more interested in the Cook's phenomenon when  was about your age
've kind of lost interest since 've been working for them
You work at Cook's Chicken
For nineteen years
What are you, a fry cook or something
Nothing so glamorous
actually, 'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters
Jesus, 'd go nuts if  had to work in an office all day
Hey,  get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me
Yeah, but still
make enough money to eat and buy old records
what more do  want
Enid puts down the scrapbook, stares at the painting
So,  don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then (points at painting) even though there was stuff like this
No, in a lot of ways things are better now
dunno
it's complicated
Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something
(suddenly) Hey, can  borrow this
What
Why
promise 'll take good care of it
dunno
they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff
Maybe it would be better if you -- Don't you trust me, Seymour
- We see another wall of student art dominated this time by Enid's (Seymour's) 3' x 4' painting
Let's address some discussion to this piece
don't like it
Can you tell us why
don't know
- think it's totally weak
Yeah, it's not right
More kids respond at once
Even Margaret is confused
These are all valid comments, but think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this
Well,  got the idea when  was doing some research and  discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so  decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism
and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture
Did you actually do this painting
Well, no - it's more like a "found art object
" And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism
It's complicated
guess 'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something
And how does an image like this help us to see that
'm not sure
mean
(thinks) guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking
long pause as Roberta and the class stare at the painting
don't really know what to say, Enid
(another over-long pause) It's a remarkable achievement
'  - Enid is lying on her back with her head on Rebecca's stomach
Both stare blankly at the ceiling
Are you kidding
It's a dream job
can't believe you got a job like that without even trying
God, wish that was my job
(trying to generate some enthusiasm) Yeah, maybe it'll be okay
At least 'll get to see every movie for free, guess
had to lie and tell them  already graduated
When are you finally going to get your diploma
dunno, but next week is my last class
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment
(waits for some response from Enid, but there is none) Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment
Wasn't it like eighth grade
Seventh
you wanted to move out right then
That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine
remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him
We were such desperate sluts back then
- Enid is behind the candy counter dressed in a brown and orange uniform
'm gonna let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself - that way can evaluate your performance while it's slow and ease you into the bigger crowds
You can count on me, sir
customer, an  , approaches the candy counter
Do you serve beer or any alcohol
wish
actually you wish
after about five minutes of this movie you'll wish to God you had about ten beers
stares blankly, hesitates, then goes into theater
(pulling her aside) What are you doing
You don't ever criticize the feature
Why
What difference does it make
You already got his money
Look, that's the policy
if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater
But  was only trying to be friendly
Look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job
Okay, okay
won't say a word
- an hour has gone by
Medium popcorn
That's three dollars
Let me have plenty of butter on that
Ewww
(making a face) Here you go -- smothered in delicious yellow-chemical sludge
(pulling her aside) What the hell is wrong with you
What
'm just kidding around with the customers
It's my shtick
Well lose it
And why aren't you pushing the large sizes
Didn't you get training about upsizing
But  feel weird
it's so sleazy
It's not optional
Jesus
#2 Can  get a medium sprite
medium sprite
Why sir, do you not know that for a mere twenty five cents more you could purchase a large beverage that has a volume of over twice that of a puny medium drink
(she gives  a look) 'm only telling you this because we're such good friends -- Medium is strictly for suckers who don't understand the concept of value
- Rebecca is behind the counter glaring at Enid
What are you talking about
What kind of loser gets fired after one day
told you - my manager was a total asshole
Don't worry, 'm going to get another job
and anyway, have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime
An angry  returns with her drink
'm not at all happy with this latte what do you intend to do about it
'   - It's the next day
Enid has set up a   in front of her apartment building
Rebecca arrives
This is it
can't believe you're selling some of this stuff
Fuck it
Everything must go
Oh my god,  remember this hat
this was during your little old lady phase
trendy young  happens along and looks through the clothes, then to the table where he picks up a ridiculous looking stuffed animal
How much is this
That's not for sale
(noticing price tag) Wait, it says five dollars
Oh, that's a mistake --  decided not to sell it
The  looks around a little more and then leaves
What was that all about
thought everything must go
Oh yeah right, like 'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus
couple is browsing
The , a severely skinny, in platform shoes looks at the clothes; the , a long haired , goes through her records
How much is this dress
Oh my god, you're selling that
(long pause) That's five hundred dollars
What
Five hundred
You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars
was wearing that dress the day lost my virginity
Well why do  care about that
Why do you even want it
It would look stupid on you
God, fuck you
Enid turns to the boy - he's holding some records and a book
Put that stuff back, it's not for sale
What is this
Some fuckin' joke
Yes
Go away
They stomp off
Now are you going to get a regular job
(defeated, quiet) Don't worry
If it makes you feel any better, don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff
Yeah, thanks
'   - Twenty minutes later
Most of the stuff is gone
Enid packs up one last box to carry inside
Do you want to do something tonight
can't, it's Seymour's birthday
(suddenly) Shit
What time is it
have to go to the store
was going to make him a cake
(miffed, sighs) Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow
Yeah,  guess
call me
She heads toward the stairs with the box
Rebecca watches her go
Since when can you make a cake
'  - Enid presents Seymour with a   with a single lit candle in the center
The lights are off
You can open your eyes now
Oh
uh, thanks a lot Enid really appreciate it
No, Doofus
blow it out
He leans forward and blows out the candle, then abruptly straightens up and holds the small of his back in pain
Enid turns the lights back on
Arrrghhh
Ah Jeez
Christ
Are you okay
It's just my stupid back
'll be all right in a minute
She notices him adjust something under his shirt
What is that
Oh
uh
It's just this elastic thing  have to wear for lumbar support
What, like a girdle
Maybe now you understand why  can't get a date
Yeah, well, you're not the only one
Everybody  know has totally fucked up problems
It seems like only stupid people have good relationships
(sarcastically cheering her on) That's the spirit
mean, 'm eighteen years old and 've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks
Really
Never
'm starting to think that even if did get a girlfriend it really wouldn't change anything
know
It's not like it makes all your problems go away
Then again, that's easy for me to say, since 'll never even get a date
'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you
Actually, 've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation
Oh yeah
Oh wait, you met him
remember that guy Josh
'm like practically obsessed with him, but  can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out
Why
Never mind, it's way too complicated
(pause) Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time
won't even dignify that with a response
He gets up and looks through his shelves for a record
(looking at his records) wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them
(a sore subject) Who knows
The phone
Seymour ignores it
Aren't you going to get that
Let the machine get it
have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me
After several more  the machine picks up and we hear Seymour's message
After the  there's a long fumbling pause
knew it
it's my mother
Uh
Uh
'm calling for
um
you placed an ad in the Weekly over a month ago and
well, 'm the redhead in the yellow dress
at least  think  am
saw the ad when you first placed it but was in this relationship at the time so  cut it out, and now 'm not in the relationship anymore
(giggles) God, this is really confusing
anyway, if you still want to talk to me  can be reached at KL5-2603, that's my work number and my name is Dana
um
Wow
(feigning ignorance) What was that all about
It's just somebody's idea of a joke
That didn't sound like a joke to me
what, did you write a personal ad or something
(still confused) Uh yeah
long time ago
she called before once
it's just somebody trying to humiliate me
Seymour
promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back
How can you be so sure
Well, uh
'm an expert-about stuff like this -- she was totally for real
'  -  10 Enid enters - a light is on in the kitchen
(
) Pumpkin
Could you come in here for a minute
She walks slowly to the kitchen - a suspenseful moment
She sees, first, her Dad (wearing an apron) and then, a hauntingly familiar -
Pumpkin, do you remember Maxine
Hi, Enid
Hi
(to Dad) Look, 'm kind of tired -  think 'll go to bed
made spaghetti
Do you want some
- really have to get up early for class tomorrow
It's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, Enid
(no response from Enid) 'd love to hear about what you're doing
can't help but feel that had some small part in how you turned out
(another silent pause) What are you studying
You were always such a smart little girl
'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards
- toothy, zit-covered 14--  poses with a very poorly- made sculpture
flash goes off and he jumps slightly, sending pieces of his sculpture flying
It's Roberta, taking photos
She moves on to Enid, in front of her big painting
Smile, Enid
Enid ad-libs a weird expression as
the flash goes off
Roberta now turns to address the class
'm going to miss you people feel that we've all done a lot of growing this summer
hope that each of you feels as though you'll be taking away something from this experience;  know  certainly will be
long "poignant" pause as she smiles admiringly at them
Remember, the art show is this Saturday at seven-thirty sharp
Try to get there at least 15 minutes early
The students get their things together and file out
Enid, can  talk to you for a minute
Uh-oh
Don't worry - it's nothing bad was just wondering what your plans were for next year
'm not really sure - working, guess
Well,  know this is really short notice, but  got a call from a very close friend at the Academy of Art & Design and she tells me that 'm allowed to place one student from your graduating class in a one year scholarship program
and, well, hope you don't mind, Enid, but took the liberty of submitting your name
She gives her a booklet and an application form
Hmm
As far as  know it includes housing and meals and everything
it is really quite an offer
wow
(pause) So what do you think
dunno
Would  have to take classes and stuff
Well, yes
Let me know as soon as you can, Enid
This could be a great thing for you
- Enid & Rebecca are in a Crate & Barrel-type store looking at housewares
think one of us should fuck Josh
Go ahead
No, really
God, you're really obsessed
am not --  just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do
thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that
Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try
No matter what happened it would be a big disaster
Let's just try and keep everything the way it is
Rebecca spots some particularly fetching dishware
Look, we have to get these
can't afford stuff like this right now
'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move
(pause, sees towels) Aren't these the greatest towels
Why do you care about this kind of stuff
Don't you want nice stuff
can't imagine spending money on towels
You don't have to
'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job
You're insane
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight
What thing
That guy's band is playing tonight
Alien Autopsy
Oh yeah
maybe
Seymour's going on his big date tonight and  kind of want to be around when he calls, so  can hear how bad it went
God, 'm so sick of Seymour
'  - Seymour is just finishing the dinner  has cooked for them at her place
Dana is an attractive redhead, about 40
That was great - jeez, thanks again for cooking all this
Oh  love to cook
guess most women wouldn't invite a man over on the first date, but  believe you should trust your instincts
When  talked to you on the phone you just seemed so
don't know
harmless
Ready for ice cream
Dana heads for the kitchen
Seymour gets up to relieve his backache
He walks over to a framed photo on the wall
Here we are
it's mocha mint from Lickety Splits
Oh, isn't that photograph just heart-rending
Yeah
where is this
Bosnia
Was it Bosnia
forget
(pause) It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy
(pause) Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention
She goes over and turns it up
Oh,  just love this song
Isn't it great
Doesn't it make you want to dance
'mon
Uh, well, that's okay -  don't dance, heh, heh
Don't be silly, anyone can dance
Here, just follow me
watch my feet
No, really  -- She drags him around
He's still holding his ice cream
'mon Seymour, it's all in your mind
Just loosen up and feel the music
Here, put down your bowl of ice cream
She takes his ice cream and puts it on a table
(checking his watch) Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're gonna have to leave now if we're going to make that movie
Oh, all right
Party-pooper
Just let me put a few things away
She shuts off the stereo as he sits and eats his ice cream
'm so excited to see this film - Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director
Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon
It was simply glorious
Uh, no
missed that one
But what do  know
like Laurel and Hardy movies
Really
never really cared for those
Why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one
'  - It's 9:30
Enid is drawing in her sketchbook
She looks impatiently at the phone
Time passes - it's 11
She can't stand it anymore
'  - Seymour picks up the phone
Dana is in the background getting some ice in the kitchen
Uh
hello
Hi, it's me
Oh, hi
So, what happened
(almost whispering) Actually, it's kind of still happening
she's over here right now
think everything's going pretty well
What
You're kidding me
Yeah, so  better go -- it's not really the best time to talk
What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date
Jesus, Enid
'll talk to you later
bye
He hangs up
Enid is stunned
Now what
She calls Rebecca
'   - Rebecca is sitting on the couch in her pajamas when the phone She picks it up
Hello
Do you still want to do something tonight
What happened to Seymour
(still shocked by this) can't believe it - he actually scored
How repulsive
So should  come over
Actually, 'm just about to go out with some friends
What are you talking about
Who
Just some people from work
don't believe you
Yeah well, you said you were busy
look, 'd better get going
'll call you tomorrow
Rebecca hangs up
Clearly, she's not going anywhere
'  - Enid stands outside Josh's door
tentative pause; then she knocks
Josh opens the door, stunned
Enid is wearing an uncharacteristically "sexy" outfit
Hi
what's up
Can  come in
'  - She goes in and looks around nervously
the note (Tiffany & Amber) is tacked to the wall
Are you the one who left that note
guess
Pause
Enid sits down on futon/sofa
So what's up
He picks up half-finished beer and drinks self-consciously
don't know
'm totally confused
Josh doesn't respond - there's another awkward pause
Sit over here
He sits, tentatively
Long pause
Do you want something to drink
Why
What do you mean "why"
Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms
Yeah, right
"Yeah, right"
well why not
What's so wrong with me
Nothing
Then why do you hate me so much
When did  say  hated you
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me
You make me nervous
always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me
That's just the way  am
Yeah, well -- It's just my stupid way of getting attention
God,  practically love you, Josh
Stunned pause, then she bravely leans forward and kisses him
He kisses back but she is clearly the aggressor
they get more and more into it
Do you have any protection
'
- 1
Later, post-coital on the now unfolded futon
Enid lies on her back, Josh is face-down on top of her with his head to the side
Enid has a blank, disillusioned stare
(now he's romantic and sappy) You must have known all along how  -- you know -- how  felt about you -- it must be totally obvious
God
always used to dream about this
(staring ahead) Why do you have that stupid poster
'  - It's the next morning
Josh is asleep
Enid, fully awake and dressed, sits on the bed looking at him, thoroughly disillusioned
She pulls out a record from his collection and grimaces
She opens a closet door and finds an electric guitar
(waking up, groggy, happily surprised) Oh, hi
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars
It's so typical
Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars
it's so obvious
How long have you been up
couldn't sleep
should get going;  feel really weird
Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere
don't think we should
Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this
Why not
Because if you do, 'll kill you
Okay
promise
Just take my word for it
if she ever finds out about this 'll never hear the end of it
'  - Rebecca is dressed in her best apartment-hunting outfit
She sits on her bed, dialing the phone with the   open on her lap
She circles something with her pen while the phone rings
Goddammit, bitch -- where are you
'  - Enid lies perfectly still on her bed, staring at the ceiling while the phone rings
'   - Establish the restaurant
'   - Seymour sits alone eating lunch
We see Enid approach stealthily from behind
Boo
(very startled) She sits across from him
Where have you been
've been looking all over for you
've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you
Really
No, actually Joe told me you were here
so how come you never call me anymore
know, 'm sorry
-'ve been really busy
Yeah, 'll bet
So, how's it going with what's-her-name
Dana
(he looks nervously at his watch) Oh
pretty well, surprisingly
you know
So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together
Is she into old records and stuff
Sort of
she doesn't dislike any of that stuff
she's trying, anyway
actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon
(not convinced) Sounds good
Seymour looks again at his watch
We really should get together sometime soon
-'ll definitely call you this week -- What, are you trying to get rid of me
No
no, it's just that  should get going in a few minutes, and -- Aren't you even going to ask me how 'm doing
-'m sorry
uh so
uh
how -- dunno
okay,  guess
(pause) fucked that guy Josh finally
so
is he your boyfriend now
Maybe
dunno
He wants to be, of course
'm weighing several offers at the present time
Suddenly, Dana enters
Seymour
uh
hello
guess 'm a little early
Dana
Hi
(pause as the gears whirl) Uh, Dana
this is Enid
Hello
It's great to finally meet you
Dana sits next to Seymour, facing Enid
(looking back and forth between Enid and Seymour) How do you two know each other
'm surprised he hasn't mentioned me we're old friends
Really
Yes, we're very close
In fact, was standing right next to Seymour the first time you called
If not for me, he would have never called you back
Is that right
Seymour begins to stammer some kind of response
(phony) Oops
Look at the time
've got to run
'll stop by to see you some time, Seymour
(then to Dana) It was really great to meet you
'  - Enid is in her room getting dressed
Dad enters
have some good news for you, Pumpkin
(sigh) What is it now
Are you still looking for a job
guess
Well, Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station
Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience, but she thinks she can convince them
Tell her to forget it -  don't need her help
- homemade banner reads: "    - :
" Along one wall is all the work from Roberta's class: a collection of eccentric abstract bric-a-brac and Enid's large painting
The painting has drawn a small crowd
We see a chain of events beginning with three talking to a matronly / who in turn seeks out Roberta (wearing make-up and fancy-ish clothes for the first time)
'm afraid you're simply going to have to take that painting down
Several of the parents have complained
will do no such thing
Then you leave me no other choice than to remove it myself
She marches towards it
Roberta runs after her
think we should give the artist a chance to talk to the parents about her intentions with this piece
We should be promoting discussion as a solution, not censorship
Roberta sees Margaret and grabs her
Margaret, have you seen Enid
Margaret shrugs "no
"  looks through the crowd college-age news-hack-type with a   - snaps a photo of the  removing Enid's painting
'
- Enid, dressed as though for a glamorous date, stands knocking on Seymour's door
Oh
uh, hi
What's up
'  - Enid worms her way past his unwelcoming stance
Seymour is wearing designer stone-washed denim jeans that look ridiculous on him
Joe can be seen in the kitchen
'm going to this stupid art show and  want you to be my date
There's something  have to show you
don't know
don't really think  should
Of course you should
'mon, 'm already a million hours late
better not
(pause) Well forget the art show
let's do something else
wish  could, Enid, but really can't right now
-- it's just that  -- Well when can we do something
It's just that, well, you know, Dana just got out of a really bad relationship and  don't want to give her the wrong idea
you know
(walking by with his sandwich) Don't mind me, 'll just be in my room
Where did you get those pants
Oh, uh
they were a present from Dana
And you like them
Well, you know
what do  know about clothes
've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me
(pause) So that's it
You don't ever want to see me again
No, of course  do
It's just that right now  need to -- What's her problem anyway
Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me
No, no
not exactly
she just doesn't understand how  would know somebody like you
What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"
Just someone so young
You must have done something to make her think you like me
don't think so
Does that mean you don't like me
No, of course not
(looks him in the eye) So, do you like me, Seymour
In what way do you mean
In whatever way you think  mean
(not sure what to say; long pause) don't know
'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person
just don't want to screw that up right now
'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends
don't think you understand how really feel about you, Seymour
What do you mean
(pause) Nothing
Don't worry,  won't bother you any more
'  - of Enid as she walks home alone
- Enid & Rebecca walk down the street
Both wear landlord friendly
Crew outfits
Where are we
This is a weird neighborhood
It's a totally normal, average neighborhood
just mean it's weird to me
've never been anywhere near here in my life
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood
What
When did you see Josh
He came into work
Why
What did he say
Nothing
When was this
don't know
God, don't act so jealous  only talked to him for two minutes
They walk along in conspicuous silence
Twenty-seven fifty-three
do you see it
(looks around) That must be it
(without enthusiasm) Great
What
It looks totally normal
what's wrong with it
said "great"
Oh yeah,  can tell you really love it
Well, what am  supposed to say
" can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"
There's something wrong with every single place we look at
Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me
Because you'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it
few passersby stop to watch
You're the psycho
You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy
(as she walks away giving her the finger) Have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life
'  - Enid is on her bed, crying
Her jacket and shoes are strewn about the floor
God
We see her Dad standing outside her bedroom
As he enters he tries to make enough noise so that she notices him before she really embarrasses herself
She stops crying and pretends to be asleep
Pumpkin
What's wrong
(her back to him, doesn't move) Nothing
Dad sits next to her on the bed and puts his hand on her shoulder
If there's something wrong  wish you'd tell me about it
Enid pulls away from him and sits up on the opposite side of the bed, facing away from him It's nothing -- it's just some hormonal thing
don't worry about it
've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling
What
(speaking slowly and methodically) Well
as you know, Maxine and have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want
Enid maintains a poker face for several long seconds before she bursts into tears, utterly defeated
- Enid, determined, walks down the empty halls
She goes into a room marked "Art Class"
- Roberta is in there with a bearded -
They're covering a  in plaster
Hi  brought over my application for the art academy
hope it's not too late
Roberta, absorbed in her plastering, glances at Enid
Just a minute
Then, realizing who it is
Enid
'm so sorry about what happened
What do you mean
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely -- Huh
Didn't Principal Jaffee call you
didn't check my messages
Oh my goodness
well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall 'm going to do everything  can to help you
Help me what
Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition
but don't worry -- 'm sure 'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall
(pause, overwhelmed) But
can  still get that scholarship to the Art Academy
'm sorry, Enid - you have to be an official high school graduate before can nominate you
had to give it to someone else
But 'm sure next year  can -- The -  makes an uncomfortable moaning noise
- (flustered, to Roberta) Hey, can you help me out over here
-  ( ) Enid walks the streets - it's dark out now
She goes by the Cafe - it's
/  - She continues walking until she's across the street from Norman's bus stop
She sees him there, as always
Suddenly, a , well-lit from the inside and completely empty, pulls up to the stop and Norman gets on
'   -  ( 11 ) knock on the door - Seymour shuffles out in -shirt, pants, and goofy slippers
He looks through the peephole and sees Enid
He opens the door
What are you doing here
had to see you
What's up
Can you at least let me in
Uh
sure
come in
(crying) Look,  just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then 'll leave you alone
What's the matter
Do you have anything to drink
Enid goes to look for herself
Uh
think there's some root beer
What about this
She returns from the kitchen with a giant bottle of champagne
That's Dana's - 'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary
You better not -- (as she starts opening) 'm sick of Dana
She opens it and drinks straight from the bottle
Seymour's look says: "Oh well, 'm fucked,  give up
" '  - Enid & Seymour sit on the bed listening to old records and drinking out of the bottle
You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room
could never move - 've got too much stuff
Enid notices an extremely ugly modern sculpture in the corner
She goes over and picks it up
Where did you get this
Dana bought it when we went antique shopping
She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me
she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs
" Jesus, how can you stand her
Seymour takes another slug off the bottle
God, she's going to kill me
this bottle is half-empty
That's great
"Half-empty" - that's what  like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed
What are you talking about
You're disappointed every minute of your life
'm just being realistic
At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports
they're all such fags
hate sports
How come in all that time  was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out
You're a beautiful young girl can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity
Yeah, but still
it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that
mean
of course
why wouldn't want to go out with you
dunno
always feel like everybody secretly hates me
'm just paranoid  guess
mean, you like me don't you
We're good friends, right
Yeah, sure
Of course
(contemplative pause) Maybe  should just move in here with you
could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until  get a job
What about Joe
Oh yeah
and Dana
(says her name with whiny, disdainful voice) You were a lot more fun before you met Dana
You've been acting way too normal lately
you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why  like you
(more drunk than before) Yeah, well  like you too
The bottle is empty
You know what my number one fantasy used to be
(pause) What
used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place
Do you ever think about stuff like that
guess  probably used to when was your age
It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and 'd just disappear and they'd never see me again
Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems
You know what we should do
Let's go get in your car right now and just take off
We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life
fuck everybody
don't think 'm in any condition to drive
'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory
So where would we go
Who cares
Let's just go
what's stopping us
dunno,
'm serious
'm just so sick of everybody
Why can't  just do whatever  want
What do you want
What do you want
--
What's the matter with you, Seymour
Don't you like me
Be a man for once in your life
She kisses him passionately
He's shocked but kisses back
This escalates, leading to the sex act, shown with merciful brevity
Enid & Seymour, post-coital
God, Dana's going to kill you
Do you really want us to drive away somewhere
What
Maybe
no
dunno
will if you want to
No
forget it
(embarrassingly sappy) - never expected anything like this to happen
Yeah, well
me neither
You must know  always
did you really mean all that about moving in with me
was just thinking out loud
(doesn't want to hurt his feelings) mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- 'm not going to let you fuck that up
But,
Shhh
really need to get some sleep
Enid turns her back to him
We see from   that she's only pretending to be asleep
She looks troubled, as though she's just made a big mistake
Seymour puts his arm around her
It's the only time we've seen him look relaxed and happy
Good night
He kisses her arm and goes to sleep
'  - Seymour wakes up
Enid is gone
'  -   - Dana is on the phone
lantern-jawed male  listens in, his head pressed up against hers
(into phone) It's a thirty-year fixed at five and- a-half
Seymour nervously enters her "workspace"
Dana is pleasantly surprised - she stops her conversation
(covering receiver) Seymour
Hello
What are you doing here
Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt finish your phone call
We're almost done
(she continues into phone) Hi
Yeah
no, it's excluded
They've already paid the earnest money
well, let them bring it up if they notice it at the final walk through
Right, great, sounds good
She hangs up and high-fives her colleague
They bear-hug
Great job
'm proud of ya
Well, 'll check you guys later
'm gonna go start the paperwork
Colleague leaves; Dana turns to Seymour
Hey
so, what brings you down here
uh
feel that  need to uh -- there's something  feel  have to say
uh, 've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, 've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so  wouldn't have to do this, but  uh
What are you trying to say
It's just that  feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out
Dana sits down, staring ahead, stunned for a moment
Suddenly she breaks down sobbing
- honestly never intended for this to happen
Please tell me it isn't that teenager
Enid and  were just friends
You know
we feel comfortable around each other
she really likes my old records and
can't believe this
thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me
She starts crying again
Seymour awkwardly tries to comfort her
Dana,
um
Dana pushes him away violently
You disgusting pig
You're just an overgrown baby who can't deal with a woman your own age
You pathetic weakling
You make me sick
'  - Enid is now utterly defeated
The phone rings
She lets the machine pick it up
Maxine enters
May  ask what you're doing
Shhh
want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death
Oh yeah, like he even noticed
Listen, young lady
know you don't like me --  don't really care whether you do or not -- but  will not allow you to treat your father the way you do
We hear Seymour on the machine in the background
(
) really want to talk to you
've been thinking about what you said about moving in here
can treat him any way  want to - 'm an adult
Leave me alone
Maxine leaves
Seymour finishes his message
Enid picks up the phone and dials
(
) Hello
need to talk to you
- Enid & Rebecca sit at a table
Rebecca is wearing her uniform
'm sorry about the other day don't know what's wrong with me
really do want to move in with you
don't know
was thinking maybe should live alone
decided to rent that place we looked at
'm moving in next week
Please let me come with you
Please please please
don't know - 'm not sure it's a good idea
Of course it's a good idea
it's our plan
But how are you gonna pay rent and everything
You don't even have a job
'll get a job tomorrow,  promise
If  don't, you can totally tell me to fuck off
'  - Enid is putting on her shoes
Her Dad opens the door slightly and sticks his head in
Pumpkin, are you in there
Are you going to yell at me
About what
Yeah,  heard about that
was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, 'll be completely out of her life in a few days
She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you
She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it
-'m not sure
yeah, maybe
Actually,  was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up
What do you mean "on his way up"
just buzzed him in
Just then, three sharp  on the front door
What's wrong with you
Tell him 'm not here
But  can't -- Dad goes to answer the door
Enid hides in her room
(
) 'm not sure when she'll be back
Enid looks out the window and sees Seymour walking away
She has a terribly sad look on her face
'  - Seymour sits in dim light, dialing an antique "candlestick" telephone
In the background, a Peter, Paul and Mary concert plays on the
We hear three rings followed by Enid's answering machine message
He hangs up before it finishes
Joe walks by the doorway
Well, here's where the fun never stops
Yeah, 'm really, really happy
Really having a good time
Still torturing yourself over that Enid, huh
Seymour doesn't answer
He looks away
Where else am  ever going to find another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley records
(pause) She could at least have the decency to call me back
Maybe she was just using you to try and get back at some guy
Who knows
It could be a million things
It's wasted time trying to logically figure out the female brain, that's for sure
Again no answer from Seymour, he stares off into space
Maybe she's got another boyfriend
(bummed out, wants Joe to stop) Yeah, well
thanks for cheering me up
(deadpan) No problem
Seymour looks so miserable that even Joe has some compassion for him
Look at it this way - at least things can't get any worse
Joe leaves
Seymour is left listening to the record
'   -
Seymour is at work, walking down a carpeted hallway with many doors on both sides
door opens and a Tony Robbins- ish, 35 year-old   sticks his head out
Seymour
Just the man  want to see
Step in here for a minute
Seymour enters
Have a seat
He plunks down the current issue of    - it's open to a 1/2 page article on page 8 with the headline "Oh Brother
" and a photo of   being removed
What can you tell me about this, Seymour
& '
Enid is wearing a bright orange "Computer Station" -shirt and a yellow vest with a "trainee" tag
She's looking around at her new home: a hopelessly drab, characterless apartment
So, whaddya think
It's fine
So where's all your stuff
Enid points to a small box with sketchbook, etc
There
That's all you're bringing
'm gonna finish packing tonight
'll bring it over tomorrow sometime
What time
dunno
Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do
Oh yeah
have to show you something else
She drags Enid into the kitchen and opens a - as though it's the most amazing thing she's ever-seen
Isn't this the greatest
'  - Enid is sorting her stuff into boxes
Digging through her closet, she finds a box that she doesn't recognize
Inside are her old children's records (45's)
She excitedly takes one out and plays it
She folds her clothes while listening to this song, which clearly is getting to her
She grabs mechanically for the next thing hanging in her closet
It's the uniform from her job at "Computer Station
" She folds it, puts it in the box, then stops, staring at the orange fabric
'
- Rebecca is nervously arranging and re-arranging her stuff
She puts up her gigantic new kitchen wall clock and sets the time to 12:45
She goes to the phone and calls Enid
The machine picks up and Rebecca hangs up
She does another tedious, pointless task
'  3:30
She's pissed off and goes to the phone to call again
As it rings there's a knock on the door
Relieved, she hangs up and goes to answer
(as she opens the door) What's wrong with you, retard - it's three-thirty
It's Seymour standing there, not Enid
Uh
hi
Uh
Enid's stepmother told me 'd find her here
She's not at home
No
they said she was here
What the fuck is she doing
She was supposed to be here three hours ago
Uh, do you mind if  wait
really need to talk to her
(allows him to step inside but leaves the door open) Are you sure she wasn't there
Maybe she was just hiding from you
Why would she be hiding from me
don't know
where is she, then
Maybe she's with Josh
Josh
Why would she be with Josh
don't know
Why
What did she tell you
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - thought maybe she was
What
Is she having some secret affair with Josh
have no idea -  just want to
Why wouldn't she tell me
There's no way
She could never keep that to herself
you're crazy
Really,  don't know enough about it to
That slut
(changing subject back to me) Why did you say she might be hiding from me
Did she say anything to you about me
(getting revenge on Seymour) Yeah, she thinks you're a dork
Did she say that
Look, what do you expect
Considering how we met you
What do you mean
On that pathetic fake blind date
What are you talking about
Didn't she ever tell you about that
God, she really is pathological
What fake blind date
What are you talking about
Rebecca goes over and gets Enid's sketchbook out of the box and flips through it
When she gets to the right page she hands it to Seymour
Here
Read it and weep
We see a pasted-up   beside a in Wowsville
On the facing page we see a drawing of with his name surrounded by
- Seymour's car screeches into the parking lot
He bursts into the store, ready for once in his life to make a scene
- Josh is behind the counter cleaning the Slurpee machine, with his back to the entrance, as Seymour storms in
Doug is over by the magazine rack reading a dirt bike magazine
hope you had a good laugh at my expense
Josh turns around - what's going on
He recognizes Seymour
Huh
oh
hi
uh
You want to see something funny
'll show you something funny
As he says this he flips over a    of potato chips
Then he tries to flip over a    in front of the counter but is unable to budge it - he keeps trying and gets more and more frustrated
Josh runs from behind the counter to stop him before he creates a huge mess
He tries to grab Seymour and they get into a ridiculous frantic scuffle
Seymour starts yelling
Suddenly Doug appears and gets Seymour in a choke hold with his nunchucks
Doug ad-libs cop-style jargon
Josh is freaked out
Seymour realizes what a fool he is and starts to cry
The Boss comes out of the back room
Josh
What going on here
& '  - The apartment is dark - lit only by a harsh, annoying streetlight
Rebecca sits on the couch in sweat clothes, exasperated
She goes to look out the window
Cars with loud radios can be heard driving by
She goes to the phone - she checks it and hangs up
Pause
She picks it up again - one last try
She dials the number and waits
We hear the of the answering machine
Rebecca hangs up
She gets into a sleeping bag (spread out in the center of a cold linoleum floor)
She zips the zipper all the way over her head and curls up into a whimpering ball
: "  " '  - The dialogue begins in voice-over as the title card fades
We slowly fade in to see Seymour, lying on a pink pastel psychiatrist's couch, as he speaks to his , a handsome, well-coiffed woman in her late 40s
have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit
So tell me more about this job
What exactly will you be doing
Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their  reissues
It's really
can't believe it
Remember what  said when we first started -- this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you
It doesn't pay very much, but  should be able to afford my own place in a few months
Do you think that's too soon
'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage
Why don't we start with that next week
Seymour looks up
She nods toward the large wall clock behind her: thirty seconds after five
Re gets up and she walks him slowly toward the door
Thank you, doctor
(as she opens the door) Don't thank me
You're doing all the work
pause
They stand facing each other
Seymour
Yes
Do you have a check for me
Seymour takes a filled-out check from his shirt pocket
In the waiting room, we see '
Seymour
Are you done
Did you have a chance to think about what you might want for dinner while you were in there
We can talk about it in the car, Ma
As they leave Seymour looks back and smiles weakly at the doctor
- The Cafe has been   and now resembles Wowsville more than the old Quality Cafe
There are no neighborhood "characters" anymore, only well-heeled twenty-somethings
We see that Rebecca is now a waitress here
She tears off a check and places it in front of a super-muscular, polo shirted , who is too busy tapping away at his to notice
She walks toward the end of the counter to total up her receipts
She looks up and sees Enid, wearing tasteful 1930's style clothes, sitting across from her
Hi
Oh, hi
almost didn't recognize you --  think  need to get glasses; you're all blurry
(nodding toward muscular ) You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps
Actually, he's a really nice guy
We see at this point that Rebecca & Enid are no longer friends, but there are also no hard feelings evident
Do you want anything
Maybe an orange juice
Rebecca goes to get it
Enid looks around, bemused and saddened by what The Quality Cafe has become
Hey, look what  got
She takes a crumpled envelope from her pocket and pulls out her
Wow
finally
It just came yesterday
Pause
Josh enters
Enid turns around
Hi Enid
Hey Josh
Are you ready to go
For a moment it's not clear who he's talking to, and then: (still counting receipts) Yeah, just one second
She finishes, takes off her apron and emerges from behind the counter
She kisses Josh perfunctorily
(to Josh) Did you remember to pay the phone bill
Yeah
(to Enid) Call me sometime
Definitely
We still have to go to that shoe store sometime
Rebecca & Josh leave
Enid is totally alone in the now-alien world of the Quality Cafe
momentary pause as she calmly stares into her orange juice
We see a small, round at her feet
/  - We see Enid walking down the familiar streets of her world
It's early evening, quiet except for distant street noises
She walks toward the old
It looks the same, miraculously preserved, until she stands right in front of it
She looks through the partially papered over window and sees  inside installing new fixtures: a modern counter and several small tables, all made from a sign in the window reads: "Coming Soon: Another
- She continues walking as the sun has set and there is a calm stillness to the city
She turns a corner and is startled by her reflection in a large window made of one-way glass
She stops and looks at herself
Everything about her looks perfect for once; no need to change a thing
She moves closer to the glass and, shading her eyes, tries to look inside
She continues walking
Darkness is just setting in and she has the street all to herself
/  - We see Enid at '  , sitting on the bench
She looks at the apartment building across the street
woman who has just arrived home from work turns on the , bathing her living room with that
The same thing happens in another window down the street
then another
Enid looks down the street
In the distance   rounds the corner and heads toward her
From a third-story window across the street, we see the bus as it arrives and stops, blocking Enid from view
moment later it pulls away, leaving an empty bench
The  moves upward, farther and farther away as the music swells and the credits roll
- The bus disappears over the crest of the bridge
