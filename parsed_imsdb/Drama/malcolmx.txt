Malcom Fourth draft (1991) Screenplay by James Baldwin, Arnold Perl and Spike Lee Based on The Autobiography of Malcolm  as told to Alex Haley : 1
-    - It is a bright sunny day on a crowded street on the black side of Boston
and  are busy with their own things
bops his way down the street
He is a runty, very dark young man of 21 with a mission and a smile on his face
He wears the flamboyant style of the time: the whole zoot-suit, pegged legs and a wide brim hat with a white feather stuck in the hat band
2 3 4 5
- Shorty dodges through the crowd with his packages
His smile is one of anticipation
He nods to a  without stopping; eyes a    dancing on the street, but is not dissuaded
6
- Shorty has his jacket and hat off, his sleeves rolled up
He is like a surgeon preparing for an operation
His equipment is spread out on a table: can of lye, large mason jar, wooden stirring spoon, knife, the eggs
His actions have the character of a ritual: each thing being done just so, in time-honored fashion
He slices the potatoes and drops the thin slices into the mason jar
He adds water and makes a paste of the starch
Behind Shorty is a spirited barbershop conversation
is getting a haircut;   are watching (, ) one of them from behind a newspaper
middle-aged barber, , is doing most of the talking
After  hit the number that woman wasn't no good to me at all
The men laugh
- Shorty pries open the can of lye, whiffs it
It's good and strong
He pours some in the mason jar, stirring with the wooden spoon
He cracks the eggs into the mixture and stirs
He waits as fumes rise and feels the outside of the jar as it gets hot
- The barbershop  from a door, slightly ajar
woolly head, entirely in shadow, peers out
' She says 'm cheap cuz  won't cop her a diamond ring
Had the indignation to call me a cheap black sunovabitch to boot
And when a black woman call you a cheap black sunovabitch you've been called a cheap black sunovabitch
Cholly is annoyed
It's _his_ story
Will you let me tell it
- He opens the bulky package he has been carrying, unfolds a large rubber apron and gets into it
Now he dons a pair of rubber gloves
Where's Homeboy
He is all ready; one of his hands is filled with a huge glob of Vaseline
His manner is indignant as if he were asking the whereabouts of an exasperating child
Red's in the head, man
You mean hiding in the head
Hey, Red
Your man's here and waiting on you
His hands full, Cholly opens the door with his feet and  comes out, a big, gawky, bright-faced country boy, wearing downhome clothes and an expression of apprehension
Gonna get that first conk laid on, hunh, Homeboy
Man, don't scare him more than he's scared already
Ain't too bad
Malcolm allows himself to be led to an empty chair, where Cholly drapes him with a double sheet, tucking it tightly around his neck and adding a protective collar of paper
Like anything else
First time a chick gets her cherry popped, she might put up a little fight
But pretty soon you can't give her enough
Right, Homeboy
- Malcolm gulps, his eyes on the fuming mason jar
Shorty starts massaging a great quantity of Vaseline into Malcolm's scalp, covering his neck and ears as well
All the men have gathered around, involved in the ritual
For Malcolm it is closer to being a kind of execution
Git his forehead and eyebrows
know what 'm doing
Shorty applies the Vaseline to that area
Now he brings over the steaming jar and places it nearby
(contd) Listen
You pull my coat if it's still stinging when  get through 'cause this shit can burn a hole through cement
Hold tight, baby, and keep your eyes shut
Malcolm nods his head, clenches his eyes and grits his teeth
Shorty applies the congolene with a comb, working it into Malcolm's hair
- thought you said it was gonna sting
this ain't nothin'
For a moment nothing happens, then the heat hits him
He yells, tries to catch his breath: his head is on fire
(contd) You motherfucker
You're killing me
'm burning up
My damn head is on fire
He nearly leaps out of the chair, but the barber restrains him
Shorty, utterly unmoved by the outburst, continues working the congolene into his hair
Malcolm breaks out of the chair wildly
But the three men drag him to a basin where Shorty has attached the shower spray
His cries filling the room, Malcolm is ducked under the spray
Shorty starts rinsing out his hair
Don't fight me, man
Let me git it out
Malcolm is a little relieved, he tentatively opens his eyes, then he feels the congolene again and there is another outburst
Shorty forces his head under the spray, spurts the water all over his head, wetting Malcolm and the shop in the process
7 8 9
- Well, Homeboy, you almost there
Turn around
Shorty is supervising as Malcolm tries on a zoot suit
He slips into the jacket
Shoes-off, Malcolm steps into the tight-fltting peg-legged pants
dons a wide-brimmed hat with a bright blue feather
Finally, fully outfitted, he leans forward toward his new image in the full-length mirror, twirling a long, dangling key chain
Well, all right, then
Well, all reet, then
The transformation is complete
The two laugh and slap hands
10
- Malcolm and Shorty come strutting down the street: two conked, zoot-suited sharpies
Hometown boy has departed
And the  on the street notice them, especially Malcolm, the taller of the two, the lighter-skinned, the more dominant
They walk imperiously past, fully aware of their impact
- He becomes a
When my mother was pregnant with me, she told me later, a party of Klansmen on horseback surrounded our house in Omaha

(contd) My mother was an attractive woman, an educated woman, a strong woman
10F  - posed wedding picture, serious but sweet
(contd) She was very light, her mama was raped by a white man

- - They both were posed for a picture
The music " " is blaring as   and his band is killing
The music is , the dancing is frantic, the clothes are , and the crowd is predominately , although there is a peppering of , especially white chicks
And Malcolm is a little bug-eyed as he nudges Shorty, watching mixed couples on the floor
in extreme zoot-suit flips him; a   in long blond hair wigs him
Malcolm is a little open-mouthed
,
-   - People start moving off the floor, making room for the dancers
The music begins to get faster and more furious
- '  - It is a fast Lindy
People start clapping to the beat as they form a around the , with the band at the open end
16 are on the floor, dancing wildly
They are quickly joined by a half dozen
These are the best dancers and constitute the main event of a Saturday night black dance
People crowd and push to get better vantage points and the competition is under way
It is dominantly black, but there are some whites in the audience, mostly women
One is , a spectacular blonde with a degree of refinement, something of a thrill-seeker
Many of the men try to catch her eye, but for the moment Sophia is just watching, looking for no one in particular, but nonetheless looking
: - Getting ready to enter the fray, the  takes off her shoes and bounces out on the floor barefoot with her partner
Their advent is greeted with cheers and ad libs
Clearly the crowd has its favorites
The music gets faster and the dancing takes on a more frantic and more remarkable quality
- He is looking for his partner, the girl he brought and now he sees her
He makes his way through the watching audience
- She is a fine chick, cool and beautiful
She smiles as she sees Malcolm approaching
-
Laura and Malcolm stand together, delighted to be with one another, starting to move to the music, as they watch the dancers
Come on, baby, let's show 'em how
Laura smiles shyly; she's willing
(contd) You better get out of them shoes, girl
Laura laughs, goes quickly to a bench and changes into a pair of sneakers
17 Because of the competition, Laura and Malcolm begin at high speed
In a moment they are executing the most intricate steps of the "flapping eagle" and the "kangaroo
" Malcolm starts boosting her over and around his hips, then boosting her over his shoulders
Laura is the perfect partner
She loves it
So does the crowd, who loves new stars
There are ad lib remarks: "Go, man, go
" "Hey, Red
" "Mmmmmm ummm
" : - big, fat, hefty   takes Shorty out to the dance floor, and she takes the lead
As they do the Lindy she is slinging Shorty around like a rag doll
This woman slides him through her legs and Shorty has had enough, he runs off the dance floor, and hides
-
Laura and Malcolm are, in the phrase, cooking on all burners now; and when they execute an especially intricate step, even Hamp waves over
Malcolm is sweating and flushed and enormously elated
He sees that people are watching him, goading him on
He notices that Sophia, in particular, has not taken her eyes off him; she is clapping in time to his steps
Seeing new stars in the making, the other dancers move to the side of the floor, marking time, yielding the dance floor to them
Laura and Malcolm go into a solo
The crowd loves it
Malcolm and Sophia are very aware of each other
The finale is the classic drag, with Laura hanging limp around Malcolm's neck as he capers off the dance floor to the spontaneous applause of the audience
-  (-) Clapping enthusiastically -- in open admiration
- Waiting to catch them as they come off
Shorty is whistling and shaking his hand appreciatively
He is also looking out for his dance partner
Hey, man, gimme some skin
Shorty, this is Laura
Laura is flushed and out of breath and joyous
'Lo
've got to freshen up
Now you come back
Laura laughs as she goes
She surely will be back
That's a fine chick
Fine as May wine
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma
Make it too easy and it ain't no fun
Then his vision catches Sophia, who is approaching him
She makes a simple, direct gesture, "Want to dance
" Malcolm eyes Shorty and wordlessly glides into Sophia's arms
- Immediately from the glances of the other men at the dance, he is the cynosure of all eyes
He has new status
It's a heady feeling because she is the first white girl he has ever been with socially who is not an obvious whore
He begins to show off a little, cuts a few fine steps
-
They are dancing closer than before
Sophia begins to rock his black world
- Trying to play it cool -- but he is beginning to pant
Not from the dancing, but from the situation: a gorgeous white chick asking for it
Why don't you take your little girl home, Red, and come on back
He stops in his tracks
He can't believe it
(contd) Just walk
Don't run
It'll be here when you get back
He can only grin
18
'  -  - The porch of a respectable house
Malcolm with Laura; he anxious to get away
better not come in
ain't stupid
mean it's late, baby
know where you're going
'm going to bed
gotta work tomorrow, need my rest
Laura walks to the door
(contd) Baby, 'll call you tomorrow
What for
ain't white and  don't put out
The front door opens, it's Laura's grandmother,
'Night, Mrs
Johnson
He runs down the porch steps
19
'  - The lone light emits from the car radio which plays The Inkspots' " '
" - Sophia pulls her tight sweater over her head to expose two full ripe white breasts
Malcolm's eyes are popping out of his head
: It's very unusual for women not to wear a bra back in that day but you might say Sophia was way ahead of her time
Malcolm, look at them
Have you ever seen white breasts like these
- He shakes his head
(contd) Put your black hands on them
He is paralyzed
(contd) Please do as  say
Malcolm mumbles something
He then kisses Sophia as if his black life depended on it and he commences to kill it
(contd) Hey, baby
She stops him for a moment, but he buries his head in her long neck
(contd) Am  the first white woman you've been with
She already knows the answer
He laughs
Sheeet, you ain't
had aplenty
That isn't a whore
Knowing she's right, Sophia becomes the aggressor
beat -- both panting -- then Malcolm stops abruptly
He raises his hand to his face, then to Sophia's hand which is still caressing him
That's alright
Baby, take your time
Sophia's not going anywhere
told you to walk, don't run
Shhhh
don't like women that talk
- She shrugs, then moves to embrace him
Who wants to talk
The couple starts at it again
19A
- On the screen, Bogart and Cagney are blasting away the dirty, flat- footed coppers with machine guns
It's one of those great Warner Brothers gangster  movies, maybe _The Roaring Twenties_
- Malcolm and Shorty sit, transfixed in their seats
Don't you know, you can't hump the Bogart
Eat lead, coppers
80
- bright, sunny day, long shadows in the park
The Commons is almost empty
Two improbable zoot-suited blacks race past trees, and run over the grass
Malcolm and Shorty are playing Cops and Robbers while stare
Bang, bang
You're dead
Naw, you missed me, copper
Try this on for size
Malcolm fires an imaginary tommy machine gun at Shorty
forgot to tell you 'm wearing a bulletproof vest
The hell you are
'm tired of always playing the cops
wanna be Bogart sometimes
You're too small to be Bogart
'm not too short to be Cagney
Shorty shoots Malcolm from behind
(contd) Pow
Take that
Malcolm acts as if he's been hit
Ahhh
You got me, you dirty, filthy, rotten, stinking copper, only a low-down yellow rat bastard would shoot a man in the back
Malcolm starts to stagger, this is a long drawn out Hollywood drawn-out death a la Cagney death in _Public Enemy_
- Malcolm falls directly into the camera, face first, and Shorty stands over him
He use to be a big shot
21 22 23 24 25 26
-  ( ) Earl Little's face is in the same exact position as Malcolm's from the previous scene
His mouth opens in terror as the moving trolley comes closer and closer to the black man lying on the tracks
27
- room, clinically empty; table, chair, and
He is putting papers into his briefcase; the hearing is concluded
What you mean took his own life
'm sorry, ma'am
You heard the verdict
man bash in the back of his head with a hammer, lay down on the tracks and kill himself
We merely act on the verdict
We don't make them
He is nearly out the door
Do you pay or don't you
Read the policy, ma'am
It clearly states
28 29
'  - Malcolm lies in bed, naked under the sheet
half-empty whiskey bottle and an ashtray full of butts are on the night table: last night's partying
You like 'em scrambled soft or hard, sweetie
'mere
at the stove fixing eggs
She wears an apron and nothing else
It's a nicely furnished middle-class apartment
Sweetie, they're almost ready
You hear me, girl
She shrugs, shuts off the burner, smiles and ambles toward him
You the man
You better believe it
She starts to sit down on the bed next to him
(contd) Sit over there
He points to a nearby chair
Sophia makes an amiable hand-shrug and complacently goes
You evil this morning
What's your story, baby
He doesn't want to hear her; he wants to talk
He goes right on: (contd) You one of them white bitches can't get enough black dick
Is that what you are
Sophia smiles
She aims to please
Malcolm smacks the bed next to him
She gets up and comes over
(contd) Take it off
She takes off the apron
(contd) Now kiss my feet
Kiss 'em
- As Sophia bends to do so
Feed me
Sophia now has the scrambled eggs on a plate at Malcolm's side
She spoons some into his mouth
He chews and swallows slowly, then grabs her head and brings it to his
long, brutal kiss
Then he pulls her head away by the hair
She looks at him: anything he wants
Yeah, girl; that's your story
When you gonna holler "rape," sister
Me
You will, baby -- if the time come
Lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot
Malcolm lays back on the pillow and she holds out the eggs to him
Sure wish your mama and papa could see you now
And that ofay you gonna marry
30
-   - Malcolm and Laura are on a deserted Cape beach
They are dressed but have their shoes and socks off, and he has his trousers rolled up
They walk, like birds, avoiding getting their feet wet as the waves roll in
Malcolm, you can be anything you want
You got class and you're smart
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin
do know  love you
Laura stops him and moves to him
Her kiss is a tender one, exploratory
Then Malcolm responds, embracing her fully
Her arms go around him as they both drop into the sand
- Oh, Malcolm,  love you
Please, there's no one around
Now
Malcolm turns his head from her, he gets up
Let's go
Why
Is it because of your white gal
Folks say you're running around town with her
Save it, baby
Save it for Mr
Right, 'cause your grandma's smarter than ya think
She looks at him
She raised me, my mother died when  was six
Is your mother alive
Yeah, she's alive
31 32 33
- Laura is eating a banana split
Malcolm is smoking and drinking coffee
You know how dumb  was
used to think that "Not For Sale" was a brand name
Laura looks over
She doesn't understand
34
- Louise's hand reaches for a small sack of flour stamped "Not For Sale
" She brings it down on the table with a hard, controlled whap
' did knock
Louise doesn't look up
Did you hear me say come in
Louise with a   ,   complete with pad, pencil and goodwill
Huddled out of sight, but nonetheless visible, are five small
There's no point in fighting about it
'm sorry
May  sit down
Louise is very aware of the children and struggling for self-possession
As you nice enough to ask, we'll git you one
One of the children brings over a chair
Miss Dunne sets out her papers
It's the same questions, Mrs
Little
Since the death of your husband-- Murder
-- there is a serious question as to whether -- These  are  my  children
Mine
And they ain't no question
None

Little, candor is the only kindness
' (contd) All of your children are delinquent, Mrs
Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief
Get out
(still sitting) Your control over your children, therefore-- Did you hear me
You'll regret this, Mrs
Little
If you don't move out through that door, you're going to be past all regretting

Laura and Malcolm
Neither is talking
She is simply watching him as he sips his coffee and puffs on a cigarette
36A
'  - Think about something you can be
You're good with your hands
People would give you work

Why don't you become a carpenter
That's a good profession for a nigra

You want my skin

'mon, Joe
#1 Turn it up, Tully
It is up
Fool be quiet
#2 Tully, move the antenna
Tully turns some knobs

Joe is just playing possum
He's waiting for an opening
The waiters are acting as if they are at ringside
left jab to the jaw and a right cross, scored by Louis and Conn is hurt, as Louis rips a right to the jaw
Conn is staggering, but he won't go down
Conn bops a left hook, he's reeling around the ring
Louis hooks a left and a right to the jaw and Conn is down
The waiters are going crazy
He's taking the count, four, five, six, seven, he's on his back, eight, nine, he's getting up, no
The referee says it's over
The bout has stopped
The waiters are all jumping up and down when the galley door opens
, the white man in charge of the kitchen, pops his head in
What in hell's going on
In a moment's notice Tully and the others have resumed their customary servient roles
Nothing, Mr
Cooper
Got a lot of hungry customers out there
Yes sir, Mr
Cooper, soup done finished
On my way, Mr
Charlie
Cooper eyes him narrowly
The name is Mr
Cooper and don't you forget it
Mr
Cooper

Malcolm picks up a slab of cream pie and pushes it in Blades' face

He pulls out a bill
Keep the change
And takes a satisfying bite out of his thin sandwich
46
-
As the Clipper surfaces in Harlem, pulls up to the 125th Street station
47
125TH   -
Malcolm, out of uniform and dressed in his zoot suit, comes down from the Park Avenue station in Harlem
He is hit with the sights and sounds
Everything delights him: the noise, the lights, the women, the pimps, the signs, the windows, the crowds, the laughter, the music
48 49 50 51	 - run by Malcolm yelling and screaming
The Brown Bomber, The Brown Bomber, Joe Louis, the heavyweight champion of the world

Lawd have mercy
Great day in the morning

50B
125TH All traffic has stopped, there is a huge spontaneous celebration going on
Black folks are everywhere, it seems as if all of Harlem is out on the streets
The citizens of Harlem are hugging, kissing, drinking, dancing, folks are hanging from street lamps, yelling out their windows, holding up hand-made   banners, everyone has great reason to be joyous
The heavyweight champion of the world is a --  ,   , he has regained his championship
: - Malcolm quickly looks at his watch, he's running late for his train, as he fights his way through the crowd like a salmon going upstream, the up to see him eventually get lost in a sea of "cutting loose
" 51- 56- : 57
- Malcolm, newly conked and sharp as a tack (zoot suit, trouser crease like a knife's edge, orange knob-toed shoes) walks toward his goal: Small's Paradise
The street is crowded with ,  and
Slow down, daddy, what's your hurry
Lemme show you somepin brand new
Malcolm smiles "No thanks" keeps moving
Hey, man, hundred-dollar ring -- diamond; and a ninety dollar watch
Take the both of them for a quarter; twenty-five bucks
Malcolm waves; he's not having any
Goes on
58
'  - Before entering, Malcolm sharps himself a bit, picking off some lint, cocking his hat
And enters
59
'  - The restaurant is crowded, both at the bar and at the tables beyond
The immediate impression is of subdued well-being, of decorum, of easy affluence
This is the world Malcolm wants into
He digs it, drinking in its details
- big man, , accidentally bumps into Malcolm almost knocking over
The word is excuse me
Look, country boy, you shouldn't have been in my way
Everyone becomes quiet in the bar
(contd) So what are you gonna do
Go run home to your Mama
Malcolm grabs a bottle off the bar counter and with lightning speed brings it crashing down on Fox's head
As he lays on the floor with head bleeding, Malcolm kicks him in the stomach _two times_
It's done, the fight is over and people pull him off of Fox
Don't ever again in life step on my Florsheims again, and never talk-bout my mother
Gimme a whiskey
pours him a double
ordered a single, Jack
The double's on that gentleman
Jack
He points
-  ' The elderly man nods
He is big, he is very black
The same color as Malcolm's father
- He raises his glass, toasts Archie and downs it
Then leaning into the bar, asks: Who is he, man
That's West Indian Archie
Whut's he do
The bartender would not normally answer this, but Malcolm is the man of the moment, so the bartender speaks: This and that
Malcolm nods, then looks over again at Archie -- in appreciation
Archie wiggles a finger for him to come over
59A 	 ' Malcolm is standing
Sit down
We ain't fixing to eat you
You look brand new in town
Pretty handy with a bottle
He had it coming
Malcolm sits
There are no introductions
He just nods at  and What they call you

Sammy and Cadillac are watching a little skeptically
Archie is flattered
Sombitch and  ain't never been to Beantown
Man's rep travels
How 'bout that
Then seeing Sammy and Cadillac's dubious visages, Archie adds: (contd) You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy
My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist
Archie laughs
Even Sammy smiles
Cadillac still holds his judgment
Is your papa West Indian

She's from Grenada

Archie looks at him sharply
Boy, look me in the face

(contd) Did you just now con me
Yes, sir

Archie and Sammy laugh at his directness
Cadillac smiles
Archie pushes back his chair, about to get up
got me a little run to make
Malcolm has suddenly been excluded and he wants desperately back in
Can  run with you, Mr
Archie
Archie eyes him, weighing him seriously
like your heart and  like your style
You might just do, Little
Lessen you got to git back to that train job
done told the man what he could do with his train
When
Just now
The three established hustlers smile at the newcomer in their midst
Come on, baby
We going shopping
60 61 62 63
'  - Malcolm is looking at himself in a mirror in Archie's room
He has on the full outfit now, together with a new white on white shirt and a Sulka tie
Looks great
Just the middle button, baby
Just the middle one
Malcolm buttons the jacket and turns around, demonstrating for Archie's inspection
(contd) You looking good, Little
Real clean
Clean as the Board of Health
But you missing something
What
Frisk me, baby
Give me a real pat down
Malcolm doesn't understand, but he senses something -- and becomes excited
Archie has walked over to him
(contd) Go ahead
Do me
Malcolm frisks him carefully: pats his sides, his pockets, under his arms, his legs
Archie is clean to the touch
(contd) (triumphantly) And 'm still carrying
He smacks the small of his back
Then, reaching under his coat, he takes a revolver out from the middle of his back
And hands it to Malcolm
- Holding the deadly instrument, fascinated by it, hefting it, feeling its power
It's yours, baby
Put it on
Malcolm slips it carefully into the small of his back, behind his trouser belt
His first gun: the feeling shines in his eyes, Bogart has become a black man
(contd) How's it feel
Solid, daddy
Okay, baby
Now you outfitted
You ready to tackle the street
Let 'em come
'm ready
64	/
- for the last three digits
64A	   at the end of a day's trading
for the last three numbers
64B	 in a pulpit, reading from the Bible
Let us turn to the Gospel according to St
John
Chapter 3, Verse  83
3, 8, 3
Malcolm scribbles the number onto a piece of paper
64C Ringing up an amount: $2
98
2, 9, 8
Malcolm's hand writes out the number
64D	 - It reads "New York to Chicago
"     "Train arrives 1:05
" 1, 0, 5
Archie with Malcolm as the latter writes down "1, 0, 5
" told you less paper, less trouble
'm working on it
keep all my numbers in my head
've never written any down
He taps his head
64E 	 - saw it in my dream
5, 5, 5
And last week my sister had a dream and she hit
64F 	 - got it from Ching Chow
It got to be 2, 5, 1
65 66 67 68 68A
- - Malcolm's intense face, he is pulling on a fat joint
We hear  blasting his way out of a police blockade
phone rings
69 70 71
'  - There is music playing
Wordlessly, Archie sprinkles a few grains of fine crystal onto a round shaving mirror
He slides it across a table to Malcolm and hands him a short straw
Sophia sits next to Malcolm; she and Archie are already high
Malcolm leans over the mirror, placing the straw in his nostril
- ' In the mirror (something satanic about him) -- as he sniffs the cocaine well into his nose
beat as he leans back waiting for the drug to take hold, Malcolm looks into dressing mirror
It hit
Nnnnnnn
Malcolm with gun in hand does his Bogart gangster imitation
Ain't nuthin' in the world to give you that real deep cool
Like girl
You there
'm there, daddy
Wheww
'm cool enough to kill
Bet you are
- ' Malcolm, you're so funny
She continues to laugh
You got any money
Before Sophia can answer he grabs her pocketbook, dumping all the contents on the floor but the dough
Baby,  was gonna give it to you
Well, bitch you move too slow
Sometimes you got a big ugly mouth
Yeah, and 'm putting my money where my ugly mouth is
'm putting you back in the numbers right now
(to Sophia) Baby, what's today
Sophia is not sure of this, or anything else
August 2nd
think
Yeah
She laughs at her achievement
Daddy, put me down for a combination
Combinate me, daddy: 8, 2, 1
You got me
8, 1, 2; 1, 8, 2
With each number he throws a bill at Archie
(contd) 1, 2, 8; 2, 8, 1
git 'em all
(angrily taking the money) 'll take your goddam bet
Malcolm slides his tongue down Sophia's throat
72 73 74 75
'  - miserable night, raining and cold
Malcolm turns into the bar
76
- Shaking off the rain as Malcolm walks through
He is now a familiar figure to the bar's
He is met with ad lib cries: "Hey, Little," "Have a taste," from the men; and from the women: "Come here, sugar," "Where you been
" Malcolm acknowledges the greetings, strolls down in the bar
It's immediately clear that a subtle change has come over him
He is no longer the neophyte but a well-groomed, smooth, fully polished hustler
- Malcolm sits into the booth and motions for the waitress
- fine copper tan waitress comes to him
thought you said we were going to the movies last night
say a lot of things
And like a fool  believe it
Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's
Honey stares at him
(contd) said now
She leaves
He leans his head back against the booth -- Daniel come in yet, Honey
Malcolm turns his head sharply at the sound of the voice
It's familiar, a sound from the seemingly distant past
He looks toward the bar and sees the women who asked the question
- ' It's Laura, but not the Laura we last saw
She is still young, still vulnerable, but she is bolder, more self-assured, more vividly dressed
She is unaware of Malcolm
Ain't that him now
He is a young, cocky, nervous, gingerbread colored boy who comes over to her quickly
He goes to the corner of the bar and quickly grabs Laura's neck and kisses her hungrily
Hey, gorgeous, how you been
Waiting long
Lemme see you
Wow
It's obvious he's a junkie
And in need of a fix
- Honey places his drink and cigarettes before him
He's watching, taking it all in immediately
Laura is clearly crazy about Daniel
- He looks, then belts down his drink
- Daniel motions to her pocketbook and she takes out a five-dollar bill
He grabs it, and bolts for the door
She has been watching Malcolm
You know that gal
Mind your own goddamn business
She comes in a lot
'Bout every other night, Red
With him
Honey nods
(contd) She know
If she got eyes, she do
- Walking toward the door, looking for Daniel
She leaves the bar
- Is she hooking
Not yet
But the way things going, that boy gonna turn her out any day
Malcolm smacks the table in frustration
(contd) You stuck on her
- Malcolm's glass on the table is trembling
Shut up, bitch
He raises his arm to hit her and it is held back before it can find its mark
Don't do that
Archie is standing above him
Malcolm nods, and Archie lets his arm go; standing next to him is Sophia
(contd) Honey, he didn't mean it
Archie wiggles his fingers and Honey goes, but not before throwing daggers at Malcolm and Sophia
Archie sits down, takes out a cigar
For a good beat there is a coolness between them
Then Malcolm reaches over and lights Archie's cigar
Sophia stares at her man, he then motions for her to sit down beside him
(contd) Thanks
You got it
Who's beating on you, Red
You looking a little up tight
The father-son thing is back, but Malcolm will never again be the student
Daddy, where's my money
What you talking
You owe me six big ones
Archie looks at him, non-comprehending
1, 2, 8 hit, didn't it
You din't have no 1, 2, 8
Was you that high
Old man,  threw the slats at you
said to combinate me
You never had it
The bitch was there
Archie doesn't even look at Sophia
Shit, what else she gonna say
Then skip it, man
But you slipping, baby
You done slipped
Archie is controlling himself
Everyone in Small's is all ears, a falling out between Malcolm and Archie -- their reps are at stake
Archie looks at Sammy
Sammy is neutral
Archie digs in his pockets, comes up with a roll
He peels off six $100 bills and throws them on the table in front of himself, as he gets up
Oh, sit down, man
What you tasting
'm buying
ain't drinking hot piss with you
Come on, Sam
Be right there
Archie goes
(contd) Twenty-two years he didn't never forget no number
Got to be a first time, daddy-o
He gonna, check the collector he turn into
His rep is on the line, boy, and so's yours
If you lying, one of you is dead
Ain't gonna be this mother
Sammy goes
(contd) Come on, sweetlips,  got us some g-i-r-l, girl
Let's you and me fly
77 78 78A 79 80 81 82 83 84 85
- The well-known 52nd Street nightspot features Billie Holiday stand-up cutout of her is outside
86
- This is a plush nightclub, with a mixed black and white
Some of the hustlers from Small's are in evidence
- Lady Day starts into " '
" - Malcolm and Sophia high as a kite and on the town
- He makes his way toward Malcolm's table
There is murder in his eyes
- You're a damn liar
- (contd) You _took_ me, you bastard, and now 'm taking you
- It's me or you, ain't it, Pops
You know it
'll give you back the 600
don't want your money
'm wearing, Archie
There's two guns on you
His eyes gesture
Malcolm looks: ' P0V Sammy at the nearby bar: his hand in his coat pocket
- His hand is also in his pocket
And every cat's watching, ain't they
It's a toe-down
That's what it is
Walk on out
Let Billie finish
Now
Archie backs away from the table, his gun on Malcolm
As Sammy moves a step toward Malcolm, Malcolm rises in his seat
You had the number
Baby,  got to let this old man win
Keep the faith, and tell Billie 'll see her later
- She knows what's going on
- Sammy and Archie are walking behind Malcolm, when he pushes a waitress into their path with drinks flying everywhere, Malcolm darts away
87 He races into the men's room
Archie and Sammy run after him
88
'  - There is an open window
Archie is leaning out, looking both ways
89
'   -   ' tiny alleyway
No one is visible
The dirty yellow rat bastard
90
~  - Don't push it
You way ahead
You back on top
That boy loves you, man
What you say
He gave it to you, Archie
He did
91
- Malcolm comes running out of an alleyway and onto the street
He stops to catch his breath, to regain his composure
He is shook up, frustrated, but mostly saddened
He then runs down the block and into a 91A
-   -  ( ) - - Earl is sitting up in bed, he wakes his sleeping wife Louise, next to her is a baby in a crib, another child
Malcolm sleeps between Earl and her
91AA	 - Outside the house are 5 members of
They are dressed in the style of the , but in black sheets rather than white gasoline cans being passed around
Somebody out there
Wake the children
Earl starts to put on his overalls and reaches for his gun which sits on a nearby chair when an explosion of flames greets the house
(contd) Everybody out
Get the kids
- ' Flames roar through the room and the Little kids are hysterical
Louise rushes in and pushes them past the fire, she has infant in hand covered in a blanket
- 91C
- The entire house is in flames
The Little family stands in front of it, just out of harm's way
- They sit on their horses watching the results of their work
- Boy, good thing we're good Christians
Nigger, it's time for you to leave this town
- This here is 'pose to be a free country
- Rev, we warned you 'bout that Garvey preaching, stirring up the good nigras here
Boy, next time you're a dead nigger
- ain't a boy
'm a man, and a real man don't hide behind no bedsheets
Earl takes his pistol out from behind his back and fires above their heads
(contd) Take these here bullets for dem sheets
- The bullets send the Black Legion flying into the glorious
Griffith moonlit night
- The burning house collapses behind the Little family
- Earl,  know you a better shot than that
You shoulda killed 'em all, shot 'em dead
Just wanted to scare 'em, they won't be bothering us no more
- Young Malcolm stares at his father while the house still burns behind him, no doubt drawing on the great courage displayed by his father
They won't be here no time soon
'm a
91D
-  -  ( ) It's raining cats and dogs and it's foggy
We hear a big thud, then a grunt and Earl Little falls across the trolley tracks, the sound of men running away is heard in the distance
- - He has been beaten to a bloody pulp
- - He opens his one good eye
- He sees something ahead in the fog and rain
- ' - -   , - Winces and then makes the Sign of the Cross
- Jumping out of the streetcar to attend to Earl
' Somebody get a doctor
' No doctor, get him a priest
My father's skull, on one side was crushed in, and then laid across some tracks, for a streetcar to run him over
His body was cut almost in half
My father, Earl Little lived two and a half hours in that condition
Negroes were stronger than they are now
92
- Shorty is driving with Sophia in the front seat
Malcolm is in the back
They are in the country -- outside New York
Man, 'm glad we got you out of there
With West Indian Archie on your ass, your name on the wire -- Boston the best goddam place in the world for you -- things are too hot and it's not even summer
Malcolm has withdrawn within himself
He takes out a packet of cocaine and sniffs it
We'll take it easy
got a place fixed up on Harvard Square
How's that sound
Yeah
Cool it and lay dead for a while, Homeboy
And don't worry none
The drug takes hold
Malcolm is out of it
(contd) 'll stake you, baby
got my band
'm blowing great sax
Hell, you ain't even heard us-- He and Sophia keep talking it up, trying to bolster Malcolm
- Stoned, his nose running, Malcolm stares out of the window at the receding landscape
Like every hustler  was trapped
Cats that hung together trying to find a little security, to find an answer -- found nothing
Cats that might have probed space or cured cancer -- (Hell, Archie might have been a mathematical genius) -- all victims of whitey's social order
Music of a dance combo heard in
(contd) Three things  was always scared of: a job, a bust and jail
realized then  wasn't afraid of anything
didn't care
93 94
- Shorty, Sophia and  face Malcolm -- stoned in a chair
is 17, Sophia's kid sister and Shorty's date
You got to eat somethin', Red
You want eggs, baby
Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby
ain't doing bad
Man, the name musicians ain't got shit
How you gonna have something
need a stake, a bundle, a grand
My woman can't afford it; my homey ain't got it
How about you baby
What you got
Peg smiles, afraid of Malcolm
Jesus, Red, she's just a kid
Jesus ain't got nothin' to do with this
Shorty eyes him with amazement
The degree of Malcolm's depravity surprises even him
Surprise you, baby
Well, that's the way it is
What kind of scratch you got on you
Turn out
Let me have it
All of you-- Glances exchanged among Shorty, Sophia and Peg
Shorty reaches into his pocket
95
- Malcolm with Sophia, Shorty and Peg around him
We gone rob this town blind
Anybody want out say so
Nobody answers; they'll go with Malcolm
(contd) Okay
got the stake and  got a fence
need a driver
How about Rudy
Who's Rudy
Yeah, Rudy
: 95A 	  - is with them
He is a good-looking, very-light skinned black, tough as they come
'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one
What can you do
They are in the process of appraising each other, seeing which one has the bigger penis
You name it, feller
Rudy does catering
Rich joints on Beacon Hill
That ain't bad
Tell him about Baldy
Yeah
This rich ofay, like he's 60
give him a bath on Friday
Peg and Sophia are listening, a little horrified
(contd) Then  put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby
He gets his jollies off
So what about him
So
The man got silver, china, rugs-- Might be all right
Might be, shit
Man,  know this town
got my own fences
Who the hell are you
Who put you in charge
Malcolm smiles easily
You want to be the head man
That's right
Head nigger in charge
'm the man
Okay, baby
Let's flip for it
Flip this
He takes out his gun, a
38 revolver
He dumps the shells on the table, then reinserts one shell and twirls the barrel
(contd) 'll flip first
He puts the revolver to his own head
Don't
Malcolm squeezes the trigger
It clicks
Now he twirls the barrel again and hands the gun to Rudy
Your flip, baby
Rudy is staring at him; so are they all
Malcolm puts the gun to his temple again
Red, for God's sake-- He pulls the trigger a second time
Click
Now he twirls it again
Christ, Red, no-- can't stand it
Malcolm puts the gun to Rudy's head
Your turn, Rudy
You want me to flip for you
Jesus Christ, no
Okay, okay
You got it, you got it
You're the boss
beat
Don't never try to cross someone who ain't afraid to die
You the man
Nodding accord from Rudy and Shorty
Sophia can hardly stand
All right
We'll start with Old Talcum Powder
You draw the house, where everything is
You and Peg go out and buy them tools like  told you
We hit tonight on account of in the daytime some of us got that high visibility
Ya dig
Rudy is at a table drawing a diagram; the girls have left
Shorty and Malcolm alone at a window
What did you do, Homey, palm it
Yeah
He breaks open the gun -- the bullet is in the next slot to be fired
(contd) Palmed it right in the goddam chamber
Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts
Malcolm starts laughing: a silent, hysterical laugh
96	/
- The robbery,   : -- door lock is picked by Sophia
96A	--Pencil flashlight passes an upstairs window
96B	--Rudy in the car
96C	--Silver removed from a drawer by Shorty
96D	--Peg walking down the street, as lookout
96E	--Malcolm takes off his shoes
96F	--The sleeping  ,   , as Malcolm takes a watch, a wallet from within inches of his pillow
Then, more boldly, picks up the man's hand and removes a ring from one of his fingers
Shorty watching with bated breath, he's about to have a heart attack
97
- Boston matron,
, is showing the girls her collection of silver
In a fine New England home
Beacon Hill survey
We're doing a survey for the Athenaeum Society -- We wondered if you'd permit us to include your collection in the catalog of Great New England Antiques--
Now these are my prizes
My Paul Revere silver coffee service
--    - Lovely, just lovely
Sophia is casing the room carefully as the matron continues
And my husband's collection of scrimshaw should be included
May we see it
Won't you step this way
97A 98 98A 101
- The prisoners face the bench: Peg, Sophia, Shorty, Rudy and Malcolm
The average first offender gets two years for burglary
We were all first offenders
That's what Sophia and Peg drew-- Two years in the Women's Reformatory at Framingham
But our crime wasn't burglary
It was balling white girls
They gave us the book
Burglary, count one -- 8 to 10 years; count two, 8 to 10 years; count three, 8 to 10 years
He continues giving them 8 to 10 years, behind Malcolm's comment: Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years
The sentences to run concurrently
Shorty thought he hit us with 114 years till explained what concurrently meant
It meant a minimum sentence of 10 years hard labor at the Charlestown State Prison
The date was February 1946
wasn't quite 21
had not yet begun to shave
for a    of Malcolm's face: a hardened hustler, pimp, dope peddler and now jailbird at the ripe old age of 20
: 102
- It is the afternoon lockup: about 3:30
The line of stands in front of their cells, as two guards,  and , one white, one black, slowly walk past the
check
The procedure is routine, done without emotion, as it is done three times a day: the black guard calls out the prisoner's name, the prisoner answers with his number, then steps into his cell
Whereupon the white guard slams the door shut and locks it
Jackson
231549
Door is slammed and gate locked
- Each time a gate is locked his tension increases
His face is a mask hiding his fury, violence and the hunger of an advanced junkie who has not had a fix in over a week
Crichlow
5991301
Same procedure
,
The guards are approaching Malcolm's cell
Past Malcolm are two experienced who have been watching Malcolm during the scene
They whisper surreptitiously without moving their bodies, and barely moving their lips
One of the prisoners is , a huge barrel of a man, a lifer -- beaten by the system and a lifetime of incarceration
The other is , a man of no great physicality, but who possesses immediately the gift of leadership
It is clear that Pete and others look up to him with great respect
Looka Satan
see him
Bembry's language is very unhip
He speaks carefully
He respects words and he respects himself, something which sets him apart from all the other prisoners
He bout to bust
No, he's not gonna bust
But he's not gonna fix his face to please them, neither
The check-in has reached the man next to Malcolm
Harrington
775717
Yeah
Lucky Seven
Door slammed and locked
- The guards are now in front of him
Little
Malcolm doesn't move
State your number
Malcolm doesn't answer, doesn't blink
Little
Bembry in the  of the scene
He's a new fish, Mr
Barnes
Give him a break
It's a bold step by Bembry and the prisoners look over at him with admiration
Barnes accepts the irregularity and calls over to Bembry
0kay, 'll give him a break
Now state your number, Little
- forgot it
- Shaking his head in anguish
He knows what's coming
Barnes makes a small gesture and Wilkins seizes Malcolm, grabbing his head and uniform at the same time
Stenciled on the chest of his faded dungarees is Malcolm's number
The guard bends Malcolm's head to the number, shoving the material in Malcolm's face
Can you read, boy
Thass your number
Now say it
'm Malcolm Little, not no goddam number
Oh, yes you is, baby; thass all you is
And slams Malcolm hard
He slumps to the floor
Two days in the hole
Take him
Wilkins drags Malcolm off as Barnes resumes the roll call
(contd) Burnham
551613, sir
: 103
- Only the faintest light comes into the hideous room, which consists of a mattress and a slop bucket
If Malcolm were to stretch out his arms, he could touch both walls
He lies half on the stone floor, half on the mattress
clang as the heavy door is opened
Time's up
Get on your feet
Malcolm stands
(contd) Little, state your number
beat as Malcolm stares at the man, refusing to answer
(contd) You just drew two more days
And slams the door shut
104
- It is almost pitch black
We can almost smell the stench of the room
Malcolm sits stony-faced, his back against a wall
' Water
The long spigot of a watering can is pushed through an opening in the cell door
Malcolm, animal-like, leaps at it and bends the spout, wrenching it off in his fury
105 106
- - - Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son
Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em
Door slam
107
- Malcolm is alone at the bars: the hope of freedom filling his mind
Malcolm pulls at the bars, tries to shake them in impotent fury
He pounds the walls
Empty, sick, defeated, his nails scratching the walls, he slides to the floor of the cell
It is the low point of his life: nowhere to turn, nothing to hope for
108
- Guard Cone is shaking him into consciousness
All right, Little
Get up
Malcolm just about makes it
The guard is in half-focus
(contd) State your number
He is beaten
859912
shower is heard
109
- Malcolm stands with bowed head as the hot water cascades over his broken body
He lets it run and run, but it cannot really touch his problems
On a nearby bench are his clothes, his towel and the makings for a conk: lye, Vaseline, comb, etc
He turns for a moment as he sees he is being watched by someone
It's Bembry standing nearby
Malcolm turns away, trying to find solace in the water
He wants no part of the world or anyone, just to be left alone
know how you feel
Like you want to lay down and die
Malcolm shows no flicker of interest or understanding
(contd) brought you something
He puts down a small matchbox on the bench next to Malcolm's things
Malcolm eyes him like a snake -- but the punishment has reduced him to deep insecurity and his belligerence is more cautious than angry
Who the hell are you
Put it in a cup of water
It's nutmeg
Man, what do you want
You need something
It's not a reefer, but it'll help some
Man, get outa my face
ain't nobody's punk
But he steps out of the shower, fills a tin cup with water and empties the contents of the matchbox into it
And drinks it down quickly
Sit down or it might knock you down
Malcolm sits, toweling himself as the spice hits him
For the first, he smiles; this is the first relief he has tasted in prison
He at Bembry wonderingly, unable to figure him out
If you ain't trying to punk me, what's your hype
can show you how to get out of prison
And it's no hype
Talk, daddy, 'm listening
Hey that ain't bad
You got some more
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me
What did you give it to me for then
'Cause you needed it
'Cause you couldn't hear me without it
This is a new breed of cat; Malcolm has never met anyone like him
He eyes him closely, as he slips into his clothes
What in the hell are you talking about
He begins to conk his hair, but is paying attention to what Bembry is saying
think you got more sense than any cat in this prison
How come you are such a fool
Malcolm looks over, piqued
(contd) Nobody can bust out like Bogart does it, in the movies
Because even if you get out, you are still in prison
Malcolm is putting the conk into his hair now
You ain't lying
When you go busting your fists against a stone wall, you're not using your brains
Cause that's what the white man wants you to do
Look at you
These last words are spoken sharply with disgust
Malcolm turns his hands massaging the conk into his hair
(contd) Putting all that poison in your hair
Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks
All the cats
Why
Why does everybody conk
Cause  don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like-- Like what
Looking like me
Like a nigger
Why don't you want to look like what you are
What makes you ashamed of being black
ain't said 'm ashamed
He turns the water on to wash out the conk -- which has begun to burn
Bembry restrains him, holding his arm
Leggo
got to wash it out
Let it burn
Maybe you'll hear me then
But it is burning now
Man, you better get off me
He wrenches away from Bembry and puts his head in the water
Sure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all that poison into your hair, into your body -- trying to be white
Man,  don't want to hear all that
thought you was smart
But you just another one of them cats strutting down the avenue in your clown suit with all that mess on you
Like a monkey
And the white man sees you and he laughs
He laughs because he knows you ain't white
Malcolm is drying his hair, finishing his conk
But some of what Bembry has said disturbs him
Who are you
Malcolm is completely humiliated
Bembry sees this and stops the barrage
The question is, who are you
You are in the darkness, but it's not your fault
Elijah Muhammad can bring you into the light
Elijah who
Elijah Muhammad can get you out of prison
Out of the prison of your mind
Maybe all you want is another fix
thought you were smart
And he is gone
Malcolm stands looking after him, a long thoughtful moment
He is pulling the comb through his hair
110
- are working on a beltline that stamps out and finishes license plates
Bembry is on the stamping machines, working as he talks to the other prisoners
Malcolm is painting the plates, a little removed from Bembry, but listening with interest
Barnes, with rifle, idles by a window
whistle sounds, ending the work shift
The inmates quickly file out into the yard
Bembry stays
Malcolm is half decided
You taking the yard
'm staying
Barnes gestures to Malcolm
Me too
He goes
What you sniffing around for
told you  gave you your last fix
ain't never seen a cat like you
Ain't you scared talking like that in front of an ofay
What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done
You the only cat don't come on with that "Whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss none
respect myself
man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind
Tell you this: you ain't no fool
Don't con me
Don't try
Okay, okay
Don't con me
What do you do with your time
read
study
Because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself
Respect his body and his mind
Quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork
That's what Mama used to say
Your mama had sense because the pig is a filthy beast: part rat, part cat, and the rest is dog
Malcolm has been pondering all this and now grows animated as he thinks he has come to the essence of a hustle
Come on, daddy, pull my coat
What happens if you give all that up
You get sick or somethin'
pulled a hustle once and got out of the draft
'm telling you God's words, not no hustle
'm talking the words of Elijah, the black man's God
'm telling you, boy, that God is black
What
Everybody knows God is White
(contd) But everything the white man taught you, you learned
He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him
He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light
And you believed him
He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him
He told you black was a curse, you believed him
Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary
What for
Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con
What the hell for, man
Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting for you
Okay, okay
Show me, man

Soiled with dirt, foul; sullen, hostile, forbidding -- as a black day
Foully or outrageously wicked, as black cruelty
Indicating disgrace, dishonor or culpability

-    "" ' White (whit), adj
Of the color of pure snow; reflecting all the rays of the spectrum
The opposite of black, hence free from spot or blemish; innocent, pure, without evil intent, harmless
Honest, square-dealing, honorable
Malcolm stumbles through the definition as well as he can
Bembry takes over the reading, giving it ironic emphasis
That's bullshit
That's a white man's book
Ain't all these white man's books
- They sure ain't no black man's books in here
Then what you telling me to study in them for
You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him
The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words
It's buried there
You got to dig it out
Man, how'm  gonna know the ones worth looking at
Bembry smiles at Malcolm
He is a remarkable man who always takes careful measure of his listener
He never talks down to his audience; he talks to them
( manner Malcolm later will adopt
) Bembry can talk funky or salty or, as we will see, in the cadence and eloquence of the Bible
Right now he goes into street talk
'll pull your coat, daddy
Cause lots of these can't nobody read, be he black or white or a Ph
with their suspenders dragging the ground with degrees
Malcolm laughs
He likes and admires the man
Then caught by a passage he does not understand: Man, 'm studying in the man's book
don't dig half the words
Look 'em up and and out what they mean
Where am  gonna start
Start at the beginning
Page one, the first one
Here-- As Bembry's hand opens the book to page one
Aardvark, noun
An earth pig; an ant-eating African mammal
Man, that sounds like the dozens
- - Read it and keep on reading
Malcolm's finger runs down to the next definition: Abacus, noun
An ancient and primitive Chinese counting device
If you take one step toward Allah, He will take two steps toward you

'  - He is reading on his bunk as Barnes walks by
The lights in the cell go out
Malcolm looks up, annoyed at being interrupted
He shifts his position to the floor of the cell so that he can catch the dim light coming from the corridor and goes on with his reading
- Malcolm is studying the dictionary, the last of the "a's": the words azimuth, Azores, Aztec, azure, etc
He reads a word, then holds his hand over the printed definition to test himself, half-mouthing its meaning
Malcolm is also copying the dictionary in a school book word for word
114
- There are several books on the desk before Malcolm
their titles:
DuBois's _The Soul of Black Folks_, Carter
Woodson's _Journal of Negro History_, Durant's _Story of Philosophy_,
Wells's _Outline of History_, Spinoza, Thoreau, etc
' Closing
Knock it off
Malcolm is surprised the time has gone so fast
He gathers up his books with care
He cherishes them, putting them back on the shelf carefully
You studying to be the first colored President of the States
115
- The machines are idle; no one is in the room but Malcolm
He starts to reach inside his jacket when Barnes sticks his head in
You taking the yard or not
'm staying
Then give me a butt
Malcolm takes out a half-filled pack of cigarettes, about to offer one, then pauses
Malcolm hands him the pack of cigarettes
Take 'em
don't smoke no more
He takes the pack happily and goes
Malcolm reaches into his jacket again, takes out a book
its title: Mahatma Gandhi's _My Struggle_
He sits next to the license press to read
116
- baseball game is in progress
is playing a
Most of the  are watching the game; partisanship at every pitch
base hit gets a big reaction
- They are out along the right field wall
They walk throughout the scene
- The ball is hit over the fence for a home run
There is a big cheer from the black prisoners
Pete, the batter, trots proudly around the bases
Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood
Lemme tell you about history: black history
You listening
- - Malcolm still watching the game
You pitch, baby; 'll ketch
The first men on earth were black
They ruled and there was not one white face anywhere
But they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees
Black men were never like that
Malcolm is listening to Bembry's intent statement
(contd) We were a race of kings when the white men went around on all fours
There is a crack of the bat and Malcolm turns to watch another base hit, by a black convict, stir the crowd
This a helluva game
Somethin's going on
He sees a black convict, , nearby and calls over: (contd) Hey, whatsa score
10 to 1; we murdering them, Din't you hear
What
The Brooklyn Dodgers brought up Jackie Robinson and we pounding the hell out of them, celebrating
How bout that
Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's supposed to make us forget 400 years
black man playing big league ball is something
told you to go behind the words and dig out the truth
They let us sing and dance and smile -- and now they let one black man in the majors
That don't cancel out the greatest crime in history
When that blue-eyed devil locked us in chains -- 100,000,000 of us -- broke up our families, tortured us, cut us off from our language, our religion, our history
In the stands, cheering and joyous
(contd) Do they know who they are
Do you know where you came from
We are the Original People
Malcolm is listening to him now
(contd) What's your name, boy
Malcolm is startled; answers like a boy
Little
No
That's the name of the slave-master who owned your family
You don't even know who you are
You're nothing
Less than nothing
zero
Who are you
- Wrapped in thought
'm not Malcolm Little and 'm not Satan
Who are you
- Malcolm cannot answer because he truly does not know
ball is hit
Malcolm watches its flight but his face is fixed somewhere between understanding and anger: it is the face of the future leader
told you we are a nation, the lost Tribe of Shabazz in the wilderness of North America
117
- The rays of the sun come through bars that cut across Malcolm and Bembry's face
Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named Elijah Muhammad
For if God is black, Malcolm-- Then the devil is white
knew you'd hear me
The white man is the devil
All white men are devils
sure met some
No
Elijah Muhammad does not say "that white man is a devil
" He teaches us that the white man is the devil
All white men
- Listening
Have you ever known a good white man in all your life
Think back, did you ever meet one who wasn't evil
prison whistle is heard

-
Malcolm and Bembry standing close together
The feeling is of someone taking communion: with Bembry the minister and Malcolm the communicant
Their voices are little more than whispers
The body is a holy repository
will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women
Muslim must be strikingly upright
Outstanding
So those in the darkness can see the power of the light
Malcolm lifts his head
will do it
But the key to Islam is submission
That is why twice daily we turn to Mecca, to the Holy of Holies, to pray
We bend our knees in submission
Bembry kneels in a praying position
Malcolm stands
can't
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth-- want to, Bembry, but  can't
--the hardest and the greatest
can't
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth-- want to, Bembry, but  can't
--the hardest and the greatest
don't know what to say to Allah
Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm
Malcolm laugh-snorts: Yeah
When  was picking a lock to rob somebody's house
Tell Him that
don't know how
You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul
Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it
want to
God knows  want to
121
' - Malcolm holds a letter in his hand
He reads it carefully
He has read it several times before
received a letter that day from the Honorable Elijah Muhammad
The Messenger of Allah wrote me, a nobody, a junkie, a pimp and a convict
have come to give you something which can never be taken from you:  bring you a sense of your own worth, the worth of one human being
The knowledge of self
The room becomes transformed
It is suddenly suffused with light
And standing in the cell with Malcolm is
He has materialized, but he can be seen through
He is ' It was like a blinding light and  became aware that he was in the room with me
He wore a dark suit and on his face  saw a pain so old and deep and black  could scarcely look at him knew  was not dreaming
He was there
tell you that the most dangerous creation of any society in the world is the man with nothing to lose
You do not need ten such men to change the world
One will do
The Earth belongs to us, the Black man and whatever is around it, and on it and in it
Praises are due to him forever for bringing to us again, our self and our property, the   , ,
And suddenly as he came, he was gone
The hallucination disappears
(contd) And then  could do it
Malcolm goes down on his knees
There are tears in his eyes as he begins praying: - Allah Akbar: all praise to Him who is all-seeing, all-understanding
He continues to pray
We are told that Saul, on the road to Damascus, heard the words of truth, he fell from his horse
do not liken myself to Paul, but understand
It happened to me
122
'   - poorly furnished, small, but immaculate room
There are two couches, a table set for eating, and, on the walls, a portrait of Elijah and a Muslim banner
It is dinner time in a Muslim home
, aged 20, a perfect specimen of the Fruit of Islam, stands behind his chair, waiting
Their mother, , a woman of Bembry's age, is seated, but she, too, awaits Bembry
- In the name of Allah, the beneficent and the merciful to whom all praise is due
At the window Bembry saying the evening prayers
' Dear Brother Malcolm:  am back in the bosom of Islam, praise Allah
He comes to the table, nods and sits
Sidney respectfully sits after him
Food is passed
It is simple fare: natural foods, milk, greens
The portions are small
They eat in silence, but there is warmth and love at this table
'  (contd) We don't have much, but what we have is yours
Lorraine and my two sons join with me in saying that when you come out, which will not be too long, come straight to us
123
- Malcolm is reading Bembry's letter as he waits his turn
There is a in the chair, just being finished by a   - -  sits by
Both are convicts
: Malcolm now wears glasses, all that reading in his badly lit cell has ruined his eyes
' You write thanking me
Don't thank me
Praise Allah
He did it all
Next
Malcolm starts for the chair
Simmons moves away to light a cigarette as Slim takes over
' Dear Bembry
Please thank the Honorable Elijah Muhammad for the money and tell him  have not written him because  have not yet proven myself

'  - Archie and Cadillac are reading a letter they have received
They look at each other incredulously
' But  have written everyone else

Look like Homey got himself a brand new hype
126
'  - An immaculate room, well furnished
sits in a chair as Bembry stands reading Malcolm's letter
" wrote the Mayor, the Governor and the President, but for some reason  haven't heard from them"
Bembry laughs; Elijah smiles
' Tell the Messenger of Allah that  have dedicated my life to telling the white devil the truth to his face
greet you with the ancient words: "As Salaam Alikum
" Wa-Alaikum Salaam

127
- - 6 , mostly white, but with a goodly smattering of black convicts, are listening to a lecture by
Are there any questions
Malcolm seated next to a black convict, raises his hand
It's the only hand up
The Chaplain searches for another questioner, but there aren't any
Pete, sitting next to Malcolm, whispers
Watch out, baby, this cat is heavy on religion
see this has become a struggle between good and evil
Satan has a question
There is laughter from the convicts
Yes it is, Chaplain Gill
But  wouldn't want to say which one of us is what
Laughter, especially from the black convicts
Why don't you just ask your question
You've been talking about the disciples
What color were they
don't think we know for certain
There are reactions from the convicts
Malcolm is sharply challenging a white man about color
They were Hebrew, weren't they
That's right
As Jesus was
Jesus was also a Hebrew
Just what is your question
What color were the original Hebrews
told you we don't know for certain
Then we don't know that God was white
There is a strong reaction to this
Now just a moment, just a moment-- But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people
've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels
have never seen a native of that area who was not black
Just what are you saying
'm not saying anything, preacher
'm proving to you that God is black
127A	  -  , - (Note: Try to get footage from _The Last Temptation of Christ_ [Willem Dafoe]) ' God is black
128
'  - Malcolm opens the door, the room is dark and he sees a small, slight man standing against the window, he doesn't move
This is the same man who appeared in Malcolm's cell, this is the Honorable Elijah Muhammad
Malcolm slowly moves toward him; he is completely humbled in his presence
- He turns from the window to Malcolm
My son, you've been a thief, drug dealer and a pimp and the world is still full of temptation
When God bragged how faithful Job was, the devil argued that only God's protective hedge around him kept him pure, the devil said remove the hedge and he will curse his maker
Malcolm, your hedge has been removed and believe you will remain faithful
- He cannot say anything and he drops his head, he is overwhelmed with heartfelt emotion
129
'   -
In contrast to the peaceful family scene, the room is a beehive of activity
Sidney is turning out leaflets on a mimeograph machine; Lorraine is busy making up a mailing list using 3 x 5 file cards; Bembry is recruiting on the telephone
How many you turning out
500
Make it 1000
We got a lot of fishing to do
Brother Malcolm,  want you to meet Brother Earl
He just joined the Nation
Earl moves toward Malcolm and extends his hands
Malcolm shakes it warmly
We can always use another good brother
'm a willing servant for Allah
129A
- Sunday service has let out and Malcolm, Earl, and Sidney are "fishing
" They're trying to convert the Black Christians
Malcolm speaks, while the others hand out leaflets
You think you are Christians, and yet you see your so-called white Christian brother hanging black Christians on trees
You say that white man loves you and yet he has done every evil act against you
He has everything while he is living and tells you to be a good slave and when you die you will have more than he has in Beulah's land
We so-called Negroes are in pitiful shape
Get off your knees praying to a picture of a white, pale blond, and blue-eyed Jesus
Come out of the sky
Build heaven on earth
Islam is the black man's true religion
130
, 125TH    - Malcolm is talking to a  from a ladder
And that the white man is the devil
Yes, God is black and you are made in His image and don't know it
That's how brainwashed you are
The crowd is listening, caught up in Malcolm's intensity
(contd) My brothers and sisters, they tell you you will sprout wings when you die and fly to heaven
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad tells you that's pie in the sky
Amid the listeners, watching their response
' Have you ever seen a black man who wasn't down on his knees begging the Lord to give him in heaven what the white devil enjoys right here on earth
- They turn from Malcolm, moving a few steps away, and now are the audience on an adjacent
He is a young firebrand: The Harlem Council fights for rat control, for rent control and for community control of our schools
to take in  , a few feet away
the street corner is Harlem's Hyde Park, with half a dozen haranguing the crowd with half a dozen panaceas
That Malcolm is just one among many: If the man behind the counter ain't black, don't go in
Boycott the man
Be black
Think black
Buy black
- Come to our Temple and hear the truth
Because, brother and sister, you are dead
Yes you are, mentally dead, spiritually dead, morally dead
And we are here to resurrect the black man back from the dead
131
"' " - place where black women come to offer themselves for day work
comes up to one to interview her (bargain with her)
Malcolm's voice is heard before he is seen, speaking to the women from a ladder
' My beautiful sister, for you are beautiful
Beautiful because you are black
Because black is beautiful
You work in the white folks' kitchen so  don't have to tell you that they're devils
- (contd) And you are putting yourselves on the auction block, letting them examine you like a horse, like a slave
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches that you are black and should be proud
, beginning to shake her head in accord
132
#7 - The  , now at a Muslim meeting
The faces of other listeners (from the church and from the maids' market) are scattered in Malcolm's audience
The headquarters itself shows the progress Malcolm has made
It is better furnished, larger, and the chairs are filled
Bembry, Sidney, and Lorraine are in the back of the room, pleased with the growth
Malcolm stands at a podium
We're not American, we're Africans who happen to be in America
We were kidnapped and brought here against our will from Africa
We didn't land on Plymouth Rock, brothers and sister
Plymouth Rock landed on us
Reactions: laughter, interest
Ad lib "That's the truth
" Put an end to your begging
No more "Please, Mr
White Man, Lawdy boss, brush me another crumb from off your table, kindly, sir
"  We are a nation, a great nation and don't need a thing from them
Malcolm scanning the faces of his audience as they react
He sees someone he knows and blurts out boyishly (and winningly): (contd) Shorty
The crowd turns to Shorty, sitting embarrassedly in the audience
(contd) Come on up here, man, and give us some skin
Here's a man, brothers and sisters, who shot up with me, who robbed with me, and did time in the white devil's jailhouse
Stand up, Shorty, and be counted-- But Shorty is trying to hide from the spotlight
Malcolm comes down from the platform and walks to him
(contd) Folks, the brother is shy and needs special attention
So would you excuse us, while Brothers Sidney and Earl take up the collection
He embraces Shorty as the crowd laughs appreciatively and Brothers Sidney and Earl have a chuckle themselves
133
- Shortly and Malcolm sit at a table
Shorty has a cup of coffee in front of him
got to hand it to you, Homey
That's the best preacher hype  ever did hear
It isn't a hype, Shorty
And  meant what said: join us
Come on, baby
don't pay that shit no mind
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind
If you got a mind
Baby,  love you
Take it easy, greasy
How about a snort
've been clean for twelve years, Shorty
You is something, Homeboy
My trouble is -- ain't had enough stuff yet,  ain't et all the ribs  want and  sure ain't had enough white tail yet
How's the rest of the gang
You seen anyone
Well, Sammy's dead
Yeah, fell over in the bed with a chick twenty years younger than him
Had twenty-five grand in his pocket
133A 	  - Sammy, he's dead on top of   who is screaming, trying to push that dead weight off her
' How about Old Cadillac
133B 	  - Cadillac is an old junkie, past reclaiming, sitting staring in a  , twitching, nose running
' Hooked on horse
Been in and out of Lexington Ave times
' You seen Sophia
133C 	  - Sophia is a bored housewife, she's in the kitchen cooking while her husband hides behind the Wall Street Journal
133D ain't seen Archie, but the vine tells it he's living somewhere's in the Bronx
If you can call it living
134
- knock on the door rouses Archie, by now an old and dying man
All the vigor is gone, all the life has ebbed out
Git the hell away, you bitch, 'll pay you tomorrow
Door opens, Malcolm enters
Hello, Archie
Archie sits up from his bed and stares
He tries to bring back some of his old juice, tries to stand up
My man, Red
Come on in, man
(then giving up) Hey,  can't make it
Malcolm has to help him lie back
Take it easy, baby
That really you, Red
The contrast is shocking: Malcolm tall and straight; Archie ruined
You saved my life, Archie
Running me out of Harlem
When  think how close we came to gunning each other down,  have to thank Allah
wasn't gonna shoot you, baby
It was just my rep, that's all
And don't shit me now, but did you have that number
Tell me
don't know
It doesn't matter
The thing is we got to get you back on your feet
Yeah
got a couple a new angles ain't been figured yet
All  need's a stake and a chance-- Can you use a few bucks
ain't got much, but-- No, man, 'm doing okay
Thanks
Take it easy
Lay down and don't think about it
Yeah
You could of been something, Archie, but the devil got to you
The old man is asleep
(contd) You know all the angles except how to live
135
- Malcolm walks thoughtfully down the street; Archie is still on his mind, as he passes prostitute after prostitute
Once beautiful women now selling their bodies
He passes Laura, she has been turned totally out and she looks the part, there is no way he can recognize her
We do though
- She has just gotten a white John and leads him into an alley
' Women who could be mothers, teachers, scientists
- Laura kneels down to unzip her John's pants
'  (contd) Who is going to raise our children
; men who might have been astronauts, composers, engineers; Who is going to be the head of the households
-- 136
#7 - Malcolm is addressing a
His tone is more intense, more personal than before, because of his recent encounters
In the audience, sitting with Bembry, is , a lovely dark-skinned woman
Her interest in Malcolm (true, also, for most of the other unmarried sisters) is more than religious
--and what has the white devil made of them: dead souls
Oh, my he has no conscience
He should fall on his knees and say, "My kind commits history's greatest crime against your kind every day of your life
" But does he
No
He scorns you, splits your head with his nightstick and calls you nigger
If you've had it, then stand up and come forward
If not us, then who
If not now, then when
- Many stand, some walk toward the podium speaking his name: "'m with you, Brother Malcolm," "Praise Allah," "Me, Brother Malcolm
" There is applause; some of the audience get to their feet -- Malcolm acknowledges their approval, trying to quiet them, but caught up in the heady excitement of leadership
- Both are moved by Malcolm's performances
(whispering) He ought to try to make it a little easier, Brother Bembry
Why don't you try telling him that, Sister Betty
137
#7 - The Muslim movement has grown enormously
The activity in this anteroom, leading to other rooms off it, shows that
Betty and Bembry stand before a Directory announcing activities in the Temple:  - Fruit of Islam Meeting;  - Unity Night;  - Student Enrollment;  - Muslim Girls Training;  - General Civilization Class;  - Swahili, etc
stir of people and activity as Malcolm enters the anteroom
He excuses himself from a group of , making his way toward Bembry
(little out of breath) Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street
'm sure we can
This is a new sister, Sister Betty
Malcolm nods at her; she nods in return
(contd) The Sister lectures our Muslim women in hygiene and diet
Malcolm mutters "very good," but his mind is clearly on a million other details
(contd) The Sister stresses care of the body and regular eating habits
Malcolm is still distracted
The Sister wonders if the Brother knows what Harriet Tubman did between taking souls to the Promised Land
Malcolm is stopped
He looks at Betty
What
She ate
Malcolm laughs
(contd) And the Sister suggests he put his actions where his mouth is
Malcolm's laughter is heard, in response
138
-  - - Sure 'll speak to your class
But 'm a hard man on women
You want to know why
If you want to tell me
: 138A
'  - Malcolm sits next to the Honorable Elijah Muhammad
The student and the teacher
If you want to tell me
Women are deceitful
They are untrustworthy flesh
've seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women
: 138B Betty says nothing, she merely pushes the salad plate a little toward him
The food has thus far gone untouched
Malcolm continues
- Women talk too much
To tell a woman not to talk is like telling Jesse James not to carry a gun or a hen not to cackle
And Samson, the strongest man that ever lived, was destroyed by the woman who slept in his arms
Shall  tell my sisters that we oppose marriage
: - No
We are not Catholic priests
We do not practice celibacy
If a woman is the right height for a man, the right complexion, if her age is half the man's plus seven, if she understands that man's essential nature is strong and woman's weak, if she loves children, can cook, sew and stay out of trouble-- : - think you've made your points, Brother Malcolm
What points
That you haven't time for either marriage or eating-- Malcolm chuckles a bit
(contd) --and that women aren't the only ones who talk a lot
Now he bursts out laughing
- They are alarmed at Brother Minister's behavior
- - If you'll start eating, there is a question have
Go ahead
Start
He takes a forkful of the salad
(contd) Considering today's standards of animal raising and curing meats,  don't fully understand the restriction on pork
Let me explain
No
'll do better than that
'll show it to you
Scientifically
But it's demonstration purely in the interest of science, you understand
' : Yes,  understand, Brother Malcolm
Purely scientific
139
- Before a comparative evolutionary display showing the skeletons of various animals, Malcolm is holding forth
Betty is dressed in a vivid, becoming red dress
Notice especially the claw, the jaw and the skull formation
This is the rat
This the mole
Here you have the aardvark and the boar
' All members of the pig-rodent family
see your point
So it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat
The meat itself is foul
As they saunter out, passing the huge skeletons of prehistoric animals now
Could we sit down someplace
'm sorry
've had you on your feet for hours
You've been on your feet for days
And didn't even finish your salad
140
- You're the strawberry soda and you're the hot fudge sundae
He plunks down the order before Betty and Malcolm
Malcolm takes a long, long satisfying pull on his straw
Then he sighs: That's something  haven't done in fifteen years
What
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda
How do you like it
Delicious
She laughs
He blushes
(contd) Let's talk about you for a change
There's nothing to talk about
0h, yes, there is
know a lot about you
Brother Bembry briefed me
Oh
Purely scientific interest 'm sure
(a beat) You're from Detroit, near where  come from
You majored in education at Tuskegee
You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family
can handle it
They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it
You have enough worries of your own
No, good Sisters are rare
We need every one
Tell me something: how tall are you
Why do you ask
Just an idle question
If it's just idle,  won't answer it
She takes a bite of her sundae
(contd) But Brother Bembry says 'm tall enough for a tall man
How old are you, Betty
There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm
They're possessive and vain
Are you
And dogged when  set my mind to something
What have you set your mind to
Being a good Muslim, a good nurse and a good wife
Malcolm takes a good look at the lovely woman in front of him, then a long sip from his ice cream soda
' Brother Malcolm
Betty sees him first
It's Sidney
As Sidney runs to them at the table: Brother Johnson was attacked by the cops
' There was a scuffle
The Brother was watching
141
-
Malcolm listening as   simultaneously describe the attack
small angry  has gathered
The most animated one is , a very dark young black teenager, we will soon meet him later
The cop says, "Move on
" The Brother didn't scatter fast enough for the ofay
- Crack
He bled like a stuck hog
Watcha gonna do
(deprecatingly) He'll rap a little
He's a Muslim
And make a speech
Muslims talk a good game, but they never do nothing, unless somebody bothers Muslims
Malcolm's face goes taut
He nods sharply at Sidney, as Benjamin watches them both
' demand to see Brother Johnson
142
-
Malcolm facing a  ,    and a off to one side
Who the hell are you
'm from Muslim Temple 7
Never heard of you
Where is he
The police respond with a squeeze play intended to intimidate Malcolm: Nobody here by that name
What's your name, feller
He feels the power play and stiffens in resistance
'm Minister Malcolm
Two witnesses saw him brought in
He was not brought out
You heard the Sergeant
Outside
Malcolm stands his ground coolly
Take a look out that window
intend to see Brother Johnson
The cops eye each other
Plainclothes walks to the window
143
-
Across from the station is a phalanx of some   of the Fruit of Islam
All are dressed in dark suits with white shirts
They stand in military formation: eyes forward, every face burning
People from the neighborhood have formed a crowd behind and around them Benjamin among the crowd
143A
- Who the hell are they
Brothers of Brother Johnson
Eddie, let's see that blotter
- - As the cops examine the police blotter
Yeah
We got a Muslim
The relief must of put it down
But you can't see him
You ain't his lawyer
No lawyer, no see
Until 'm satisfied Brother Johnson is receiving proper medical attention, no one will move
Cops eye each other
Plainclothes nods slightly, he has to give in, Malcolm is not playing
144
- The back of Malcolm's head, as he examines Brother Johnson
As he comes up   ,   that Johnson has been badly beaten
(shaking) Only a pig could do a thing like that
Watch your tongue, boy
Don't you call me boy, you pig
Letting a man bleed like that
Sergeant puts a restraining hand on Plainclothes
(contd) That man belongs in a hospital
Get an ambulance
Now
145
-  () As Johnson's body, on a stretcher, is hurried into an ambulance
The crowd has grown in proportions
There are ad libs: "Goddam pigs," "Damn police brutality," "Least they got him out of the meat house
" Malcolm with the Sergeant and a , as the ambulance pulls away
All right, break it up
You got what you wanted
'm not satisfied
Malcolm starts walking down the center of the street, after the ambulance
(contd) To the hospital
The Fruit of Islam fall in behind him, marching slowly
It takes on the start of a march as the neighborhood people fall in behind them
People (especially kids) race with them on the street and on the sidewalk
- Benjamin fights his way through the crowd trying to walk beside Malcolm, the Brothers in the Fruit stop him and Benjamin drops back
146
- Now the march has taken over the broad avenue
are forced to redirect traffic, holding up crosstown cars as the group walks solemnly by
The people walking behind have swelled it to a huge demonstration
Their faces reflect their anger and their satisfaction that, for once, something is being done about what has happened
147
- the Muslim men in perfect order, calm with their arms folded across their chests, waiting
Their eyes are on Malcolm as he walks toward the hospital entrance
--of the growing crowd
--of the nervous cops, including some big brass
--of kids watching from a rooftop
--of Benjamin trying to emulate the Fruit of Islam
148
- Malcolm is standing in front of the Fruit of Islam men, as comes over
All right, that's enough
want these people moved out of here
They're all disciplined men
They're doing nothing except waiting
The unruly crowd behind the Fruit of Islam
They are restive, milling, ugly
What about them
That's your headache, Captain
And if he dies, pity you
149
- He'll live
He's getting the best care we can give
Thank you, Doctor
had to put a plate in his head
(to Captain) You bastards
All right, okay
Now disperse this mob
- , It's clear the decision is in one man's hands, Malcolm's
- He makes a gesture with his hand, the Fruit of Islam disperse
People moving away, going home
Only one person remains from the Fruit of Islam and the crowd, it's Benjamin
- That's too much power for one man to have
149A
- Everyone is in a somber mood over the evening's events
- Malcolm sits with Brothers Earl and Sidney
Brother Minister, we need to strike back
Put fear into those devils
want to also, but until we are instructed by the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and pray
'm tired of praying
That's enough, Brother Earl
- Benjamin comes into the cafeteria and everyone looks at him
He sees Malcolm sitting and moves toward his table
- Brothers Sidney and Earl get up to intercept him but Malcolm waves him through
Benjamin stands
Sit down, son
Malcolm pours some cream into his cup of black coffee, then also some white sugar
(contd) There is only one thing  like integrated
My coffee
Benjamin laughs
(contd) What can  do for you
Mr
,  was out there tonight
saw what you did
want to be a Muslim
ain't never seen a Negro stand up to the police like that
- They exchange dubious looks
Do you know what it means to be a true Muslim
Benjamin hesitates
(contd) Do you
Not exactly, but  want to be one, like you
admire your enthusiasm but you should never join any organization without first checking it out thoroughly
Benjamin is crushed and he starts to get up
(contd) We need more young warriors like yourself, stick around and we shall see if your heart is true
Mr
,  won't make you out a liar

#1 -  - -   ( ) $70,000 An  of Elijah puts down the newspaper and shakes Malcolm's hand
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad would like to see you now
151
'  - Elijah is sweeping the floor with a plain hand broom
Malcolm enters the room, is surprised and waits at the door
The two are alone together
If  surprise you, let me explain
Menial work teaches us humility
Let me do it then
No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing
Allah has given you a great gift
Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all
Allah Akbar
The sweeping done, they stand together near a table at a window
Tonight  shall introduce you as my National Representative
It will be a difficult task
Your assignment is to build temples all over this nation
More work than you have ever done in your life and you will be in the public eye
My son, beware of those cameras, they are just as bad as a narcotic
-  and  come into the room now
They are listening
(contd) Yes, the white devil will watch your every step
Even your own Brothers will become jealous, and hostile, go slowly
So  offer you a parable -- regarding your work
Elijah picks up a glass and sets it before Malcolm
(contd) Here is a glass, dirty and its water foul
If you offer it to the people and they have no choice, they must drink out of it
But if you present them with this glass-- He is holding a clean glass, with clear water in it
(contd) --and let them make their decision, they will choose the pure vessel
Islam is the only religion which addresses the needs and problems of the so-called Negro, especially in the ghettos -- Islam is the only way out from drugs, crime, unemployment, prostitution, alcohol, gambling, fornication and adultery
Elijah holds up the clear glass
This sweet, gentle man gave me the truth from his own mouth
And  adored him, in the sense of the Latin root of the word
Adorare, to worship and to fear
He was the first man ever feared -- not fear such as the one has of a gun but the fear one has of the power of the sun,  pledged myself to him, even if it cost me my life

It's answered
motions Betty to the phone
She finishes with her patient and goes quickly
Hello
' Sister Betty
Yes

At a gas station
(a beat) Will you marry me
Yes
Did you hear what  said
Yes  did
Did you hear my answer
think so
Can you catch a plane
Yes
Did you eat
love you
154
'  - Betty and Malcolm sit on the floor in the dimlit room, very close
It won't be easy
Just hold me
It will be rough
Hush your mouth
'll be away a lot
You're with me even when you're away
He embraces her
Then Betty laughs
(contd) never told you, but when  first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses,  felt sorry for you
Nobody as young as you should be that serious
But  don't think that anymore
What do you think
The simplest thing in the world:  want to have a lot of babies with you
Dear Heart,  love you
Full embrace
' We're waiting on you folks
You trying to starve us

'   - Malcolm has just cut the cake and handed a slice to Betty
Amid laughter and great warmth, Sidney unfurls the front page of the _Messenger_, the Muslim newspaper
Headline reads: " " Betty kisses her husband and Bembry, Lorraine, Earl, Sidney, Peter and     applaud
We notice the subtle change in the apartment: it is more comfortable; there is even evidence of some small luxury: a  set, a new settee, etc
156
-  - Malcolm is speaking to a   : must emphasize at the outstart, that the Honorable Elijah Muhammad is not a politician, so 'm not here this afternoon as a Republican, nor a Democrat, not as a Mason nor an Elk, not as a Christian nor a Jew, not as a Catholic nor a Protestant, not as a Baptist nor a Methodist, not even as an American
For if  was an American the problem that confronts our people today would not exist
So  stand here as what was when  was born:
(contd) Before there were any such things as Democrats or Republicans, we were black
Before there were any such things as Masons or Elks, we were black
Before there were any such things as Jews or Christians, we were black people
In fact long before there was ever any such place as America, we were black people
And after America has long passed from the scene there will still be

2X Take your time
157
- The Honorable Elijah Muhammad sits on the stage to the right of Malcolm
This is a larger audience
What kind of black people does the Honorable Elijah Muhammad speak for
Black people who are jobless
the black masses who are poor, hungry, and angry, the black masses who are dissatisfied with the slums and ghettos in which we have been forced to live
the black masses who are tired of listening to the promises of white politicians to correct the miserable living conditions that exist in our community
the black masses that are sick of the inhuman acts of bestial brutality practiced by these semi-savage white policemen that patrol our community, like the occupation forces of a conquering enemy army
the black masses who are fed up with the anemic, Uncle Tom leadership set up by the white man to act as a spokesman for our people and to - - If the black man cannot go back to his own people and his own land, Elijah Muhammad is asking that a part of the United States be separated and given to the Muslims so they can live separately
- (contd) The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is the only man the white people can deal with in the solving of problems of the so-called Negro
- (contd) as Elijah Muhammad knows his problems

Our firstborn is an angel and a beauty
And misses you as  do
But the news that you've dedicated four new temples is almost as good as having you with us

- Malcolm sits in front of a television screen and watches the evening news
The following speech will be  with -  & (newsclips from Birmingham, Selma, Mississippi, and elsewhere): 158B	-- using dogs against
158C	--The Reverend Dr
Martin Luther King marching

Martin Luther King leading a crowd in prayer
158H	--Students sitting in at a counter
158I	--The smoldering ruins of Birmingham's 16th St
Baptist church
158J / The white people who are guilty of white supremacy try and hide their own guilt by accusing the Honorable Elijah Muhammad of teaching black supremacy when he tries to uplift the mentality, the social, and economic condition of black people in this country
And the Jews, who have been guilty of exploiting the black people economically, civilly, and otherwise, hide their guilt by accusing the Honorable Elijah Muhammad of being anti-Semitic simply because he teaches our people to go into business for ourselves and trying to take over the economic leadership in our own community
The black people in this country have been the victims of violence at the hands of the white man for 400 years, and following the ignorant Negro preachers, we have thought that it was God-like to turn the other cheek to the brute that was brutalizing us
100 years ago they use to put on a white sheet and use a bloodhound against Negroes
Today they've taken off sheets and put on police uniforms, they've traded in the bloodhounds for police dogs
And just as Uncle Tom back during slavery used to keep the Negroes from resisting the bloodhounds or resisting the Ku Klux Klan by telling them to love their enemy or pray for those who use them as spitefully today
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is showing black people that just as the white man and every other person on this earth has God given rights, natural rights, civil rights, and any other kind of rights that you can think of when it comes to defending himself
159 - - ' With a studio mike around his neck, he's on a panel show
- Mr
, before we start our discussion tonight -- The Black Muslims: Hate Mongers -- would you mind explaining for us the meaning of your name, which is the letter
- Opposing Malcolm is
, a -type
- Yes sir
As you know, during slavery time, the slavemasters named most of the so-called Negroes in America after themselves
Mr
Elijah Muhammad teaches us once you come into the knowledge of Islam, you replace your slave name with an
Since we've been disconnected, cut off from our Eastern culture for so long that we don't know the names we originally had, we will use  until we get back to the East
- Thank you
Now Dr
Payson
- Mr
is a demagogue
He has no place to go, so he exaggerates
He's a disservice to every good law-abiding Negro in the country
Can  ask you a question
: - Please, go ahead
Mr
Malcolm , why do you teach black supremacy
Why do you teach hate
- For the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, "Do you hate me
" The white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate
- Certainly, Mr
, you must admit there has been progress
'll talk about "progress" in a minute, but let me finish with my brother
Malcolm gestures to the Negro panelist
The   of the audience are lapping it up
Betty and Earl also sit in the  studio audience
(contd) Stop me if 'm wrong
"polarize the community
" "erroneously appraise the racial picture
" You put it very well
You left one phrase out
Another educated Kneegrew said to me and  quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture
" Would you agree
Entirely
- Well,  have this to say
Do you know what a Negro with a
, an
and a Ph
is called -- by the white man
'll tell you
He's called a nigger
There is some blanching and guffawing from the audience
The moderator is totally embarrassed, Betty roars
(contd) And 'm not finished
To understand this man-- He points a sharp finger at the Negro Panelist
(contd) --you must know that historically there are two kinds of slaves
House Negroes and Field Negroes
The house Negro lived in the big house; he dressed pretty good; he ate pretty good and he loved the master
Yeah, he loved him more than the master loved himself
If the master's house caught fire, he'd be the first to put the blaze out
If the master got sick, he'd say: "What's a matter, boss; we sick
" sick
If someone said to him, "Let's run away and escape
Let's separate
" He'd say, "Man, are you crazy
What's better than what got here
" That was the House Negro
In those days he was called the House Nigger
Well, that's what we call them today because we still got a lot of House Niggers running around
There is applause from the blacks in the audience
Moderator tries to regain control
159D
'  - - He is enjoying this display by his prize student, the   to a of  and the same cannot be said
159E think, perhaps, Dr
Payson has something to-- Don't you want to hear about the Field Nigger
Let him finish
Thank you
Now the Negro in the field caught hell all day long
He was beaten by the master; he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and hated his master
If the house caught fire, he'd pray for a wind
If the master got sick, he'd pray that he'd die
And if you said to him, "Let's go, let's separate", he'd yell, "Yeah, man, any place is better than this
" You've got a lot of Field Negroes in America today
'm one
Tell it
--there's another one
The majority of black Americans today are Field Negroes
They don't talk about  progress, about  government, navy,  astronauts
Hell, they won't even let you near the plant

'  - Bembry turns off the  set and he commences to plant the seeds of "betrayal
" - Your holy apostle, dear Messenger,  am your true servant and the brothers asked me to tell you Malcolm is getting too much press
The brothers think he thinks _he_ is the Nation of Islam, that he has aspirations to lead the Nation
It was you who made Malcolm the man he is
You lifted him out of the darkness
- Go and tell the brothers what Brother Minister is doing, has done, has been of great benefit to the Nation
- Great benefit for himself
159G -  - Malcolm is walking the streets of Harlem like he is campaigning for office
He has Brothers Sidney, Earl, and Benjamin at his side, a follows him
Malcolm sees a
Brother Man, put that bottle down, take that poison away from your lips
That's what the devil wants you to do, stay high, out of your natural mind

It's time you received your
But first you must copy this letter, exactly as  give it to you; down to the dotted "i's," crossed "t's," everything
And you must go on a fast, just water and juices, that's it
- He takes the letter from Malcolm and looks at it
'll have it tomorrow
Brother Benjamin, do not rush, it has to be exact
--Benjamin goes off in a corner and very quickly copies the letter, he's so anxious
--Benjamin hands Malcolm his letter, Malcolm shakes his head and hands it back, it's not exact
159K
-  - Malcolm is talking to a group of  who are having a rent strike
When you live in a poor neighborhood, you're living in an area where you have poor schools
159L Malcolm hands him back his letter again
The fast is getting to Benjamin
(contd) When you have poor schools you have poor teachers
When you have poor teachers, you get a poor education
159M	      - , , , (contd) Poor education, you only work on poor paying jobs and that enables you to live again in a poor neighborhood
159N (contd) So it's a very vicious cycle
We've got to break it
159O Benjamin weakly walks toward Malcolm and gives him his letter, which he takes
The fast is wearing him out
- Malcolm is inspecting it
- His face is filled with apprehension
- You are now Benjamin 2X
2X All praises are due to Allah
Thank you, Brother Minister
Come, sit with us
- Benjamin 2X sits with Malcolm and Brothers Earl and Sidney
We are now sitting with Brother Benjamin 2X
Allah Akbar
You will be good
2X Brother Minister, can  have something to eat
Everyone laughs
Let's get this man some food

The setting is the same as the last time we saw Malcolm and Shorty here, except now the students part for him
Malcolm walks slowly toward the entrance, looking up at the Latin inscription of the building when he is stopped by a Mr
, 've read some of your speeches and honestly believe a lot of what you say has truth to it
have a good heart
'm a good person despite my whiteness
What can the good white people like myself, who are not prejudiced, or racist, what can we do to help the cause

Nothing
- She is absolutely crushed and runs away in tears

- Speaking to a packed
My high school was the black ghetto of Roxbury
My college was the streets of Harlem, and  took my masters in prison
If you look out the window-- 161A 	 ' ' --you can see my burglary hangout
lived like an animal
Had it not been for the Honorable Elijah Muhammad  would surely be in an insane asylum or dead
- The audience carefully listening
Mr
Muhammad is trying to get us on God's side, so God will be on our side to help us fight our battles
When Negroes stop getting drunk, stop being addicted to drugs, stop fornicating and committing adultery
When we get off the welfare, then we'll be
Earn what you need for your family, then your family respects you
They'll be proud to say "That's my father
" She's proud to say "That's my husband
" Father means you're taking care of those children
Just 'cause you made them that don't mean you're a father
Anybody can make a baby, but anybody can't take care of them
Anyone can go and get a woman but anybody can't take care of a woman
This is the type of teaching that the honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us so we can build the moral fiber of our people
Beginning to scribble furiously
can see the gentlemen of the press, also the and
are with us
Get it straight 'cuz if  said, "Mary had a little lamb," they'd write Malcolm  lampoons poor Mary
Loud laughter from the audience
But this response is overwhelmed by the response of ,
162
- Malcolm is talking before an all-black audience
It is the largest rally yet; the hall is packed to the rafters
We have built temples in Boston, in Detroit, in Atlanta, Philadelphia, Washington -- 100 temples in fifty states
From a handful we have grown to scores of thousands
selling _The Messenger_, faces of Fruit of Islam near the podium; Lorraine, Sidney, Earl, Benjamin, and Bembry
For the first time a new note is seen in Bembry's face: reserve bordering on resentment
When others around him cheer Malcolm, Bembry is cool
Sidney notices this from his father, but makes no comment
/ The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that God is now about to establish a kingdom on this earth based on brotherhood and [
] against peace, his history on this earth has proved that
Nowhere in history has he been brotherly toward anyone
The only time he has been brotherly toward you is when he can use you, when he can exploit you, when he can oppress you, when you will submit to him
And since his own history makes him unqualified to be an inhabitant or a citizen in a kingdom of brotherhood, the Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that God is about to eliminate that particular race from this earth
So since they are due for elimination, we don't want to be with them
- - (contd) If the so-called Negro were American citizens we wouldn't have a race problem
If the Emancipation Proclamation was authentic, you wouldn't have a race problem
If the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments to the Constitution was authentic, you wouldn't have a race problem
If the Supreme Court desegregation decision was authentic, you wouldn't have a race problem
All of this is hypocrisy
These Negro leaders have been telling the white man everything is all right, everything is under control
And they've been telling the white man that Mr
Muhammad is wrong, don't listen to him
But everything Mr
Muhammad has been saying is going to come to pass is now coming to pass and now the Negro leaders are standing up saying that we are about to have a racial explosion
We're going to have a racial explosion and that's more dangerous than an atomic explosion
- (contd) It's going to explode because black people are dissatisfied
They're dissatisfied now not only with the white man, but with these Negroes who have been sitting around here posing as leaders and spokesmen for black people
Anytime you put too many sparks around a powder keg, the thing is going to explode and if the thing that explodes is still inside the house, then the house will be destroyed
So the Honorable Elijah Muhammad is telling the white man get this powder keg out of your house, let the black people in this country separate from him while there's still time
And if the black man is allowed to separate and go on onto some land of his own, where he can solve his problems, then there won't be any explosion - wave of cheers as people explode
163
- The rally is over
small room packed with  congratulating Malcolm, trying to touch him
He is the hero of the hour
Sidney, Earl, and Benjamin with him, enjoying the accolades and trying to help Malcolm make his way out
Bembry stands apart, removed and silent
Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you
Please make way, please-- -  ( ) is at the door
He and Malcolm know each other well
Malcolm extends a palm, but Gregory doesn't slap it
Can  ask you something
Sure, man
Are you Elijah's pimp
What
(scornfully) "His greatest greatness
" Say what you're saying
If you don't know, man, then  feel sorriest for you

'  - Betty, pregnant with child, is in a chair -- a newspaper in her lap
Malcolm is in the other room, putting his last daughter to sleep
We hear him
- ' Okay, last hug
As he enters, a smile on his face, but the concern of the evening clearly imprinted
He sits down heavily
Betty watches him carefully
Long day
Long night
Long year
Long ten years
He smiles
She doesn't
(contd) Why are you looking at me like that
Because you're in trouble
How do you know
She smiles
Dear heart, because  know you
pause
don't want to bring my troubles home
You know that
'm not made of glass
just want to sit here and be still
We've never had a fight
Not a real one
But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it
Talk about what
The talk is everywhere
There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk
Don't they say how 'm trying to take over the Nation, how 'm getting rich off the Nation
We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more
She picks up the newspaper and reads from it: (contd) "Los Angeles, : Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children
" There are always slanders, always lies
You're reading the devil's lies
Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger
"Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957
" was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight
To Bembry
Is Bembry your friend
Woman, have you lost your mind
What's the matter with you
Betty gets up, goes to him gently
No, what's the matter with you
Wake up
Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself
Are you so committed you cannot face the truth
Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established
Ask him why your name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a year
Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own
(rationalizing) 'm not interested in personal publicity
Our people know what 'm doing
Do you know what Bembry is doing
You're so blind, everyone can see this but you
Bembry saved my Life
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life
long time ago
You've repaid them many times over
Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture
Is that what this is about
Material wealth
What do we have, Malcolm
broken-down jalopy and the clothes on our backs
We don't even own our own home
What about our children
What about me
You don't even own life insurance
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me
Will they
Are you sure
Are you sure or are you blind
She touches him very gently
(contd) Dear heart, you have to help me
'm raising our kids practically by myself, while you're running all over the world
You don't know how many times the girls ask me when is daddy coming home
What do you want me to do
Our people need me
We need you too
What do you want me to do
Open your eyes, you can face death 24 hours a day; but the possibility of betrayal never enters your mind
If you won't do that for yourself do it for us
164A Malcolm knocks on the door of Evelyn Williams, one of the two secretaries/wives
She opens the door and has child in her arms
- Her name is Eva Marie, she's 2 years old
Brother Minister,  did nothing wrong
did nothing to be put in isolation
believed in him
believed in the Honorable Elijah Muhammad
- He cannot believe what he is hearing, but he must
The truth is before his eyes
Sister Evelyn, believe in Allah

- - Malcolm is sitting holding both of the children
Sister Lucille who is pregnant with 3rd child waddles across the room to sit down on the sofa with him
She picks up one of the kids from him
- This is Saudi, she's 3 and you have Lisha, she's 2
Brother Minister the Honorable Elijah Muhammad is the father of my 3 children
She touches her pregnant stomach
(contd) Brother Minister he often talked about you
He loves you, loves you like his own son
Says you are the best, his greatest Minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him
- He told you that
Yes sir
Are you sure
Yes,  am, Brother Minister
All  want is support for my children
He should provide for his children
That's all  want

All day since you and Betty left
Brother Minister,  have to level with you
They gave me a mission
But  couldn't do it

What mission
To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition
The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger
The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold
The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep
What does Sidney say
'm with you, Brother Minister
No
You'll be marked for death
Let me die then

In the past  thought the thoughts, spoke the words of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad, that day is over
From now on speak my own words, and think my own thoughts
Internal differences within the Nation of Islam forced me out of it
did not leave of my own free will
But now that it has happened, intend to make the most of it
Now that  have more independence of action,  intend to use a more flexible approach toward working with others to get a solution to this problem
do not pretend to be a divine man, but  do believe in divine guidance, divine power, and in the fulfillment of divine prophecy
am not educated, nor am  an expert in any particular field, but  am sincere, and my sincerity is my credentials
'm not out to fight other Negro leaders or organizations
We must find a common solution, to a common problem
am going to organize and head a new mosque in New York City, known as the Muslim Mosque, Inc
This gives us a religious base, and the spiritual force necessary to rid our people of the vices that destroy the moral fiber of our community
Our political philosophy will be black nationalism
Our economic and social philosophy will be black nationalism
The Muslim Mosque, Inc
will remain wide open for ideas and financial aid from all quarters
Whites can help us, but they can't join us
There can be no black-white unity until there is first some black unity
host of questions fired all at once: How many of Elijah's followers will join you
etc, etc, etc
Malcolm calms them: (contd) There is one further preparation  need
It is a return to the source of our great religion will make a pilgrimage to Mecca

She breaks from him and whispers: "Go ahead
can wait now
" 181
- large  : mikes of every network, every newspaper and wire service present
Malcolm sports a beard
Let's begin
#1 Malcolm, you said on your trip abroad you sensed a feeling of great brotherhood
As  recall,  pointed out that while  was in Mecca making the pilgrimage,  spoke about the brotherhood that existed at all levels among all people, all colors who had accepted the religion of Islam
pointed out that what it had done, Islam, for those people despite their complexion differences, that it would probably do America well to study the religion of Islam and perhaps it could drive some of the racism from this society
Muslims look upon themselves as human beings, as part of the human family and therefore look upon all other segments of the human family as part of that same family
Today my friends are black, brown, red, yellow and white
#8 Malcolm, are you prepared to go to the United Nations at this point and ask that charges be brought against the United States for its treatment of the American Negroes
Oh yes
The  applauds
(contd) The audience will have to be quiet
Yes, as pointed out that during my trip that nations, African nations, Asian, Latin nations look very hypocritical when they stand up in the condemning South Africa and saying nothing about the racist practices that are manifested everyday against Negroes in this society would be not a man if  didn't do so wouldn't be a man
#3 Are you prepared to work with some of the leaders of some of the other civil rights organizations
Certainly, we will work with any groups, organizations or leaders in any way, as long as it's genuinely designed to get results
#1 Does the new beard have any religious significance
No, not particularly
But  do think that you will And black people in America, as they strive to throw off the shackles of mental colonialism, will also probably reflect an effort to throw off the shackles of cultural colonialism
And then they'll begin to reflect desires of their own with standards of their own
#2 One of your more controversial remarks was a call for black people to get rifles and form rifle clubs sometime back
Do you still favor that for self-defense
don't see why that should be controversial think that if white people found themselves victim of the same kind of brutality that black people in this country face, and they saw that the government was either unwilling or unable to protect them, that the intelligence on the part of the whites would make them get some rifles and protect themselves
#2 What about the guns, Malcolm
Has the white man changed since  went away
Have you put up your guns
The day you stop being violent against my people will be the day  tell folks to put away their guns
#3 Then you're still an extremist
- Git your hand out of my pocket
Everyone turns around to the back to see what the commotion is about
The man who yelled out leaves quickly, we will see him later on, very soon

She kisses him
Get some sleep
You have to sleep for three
Malcolm pulls Betty closer to him
'm sorry
haven't been the best husband or father
Shhh
Families shouldn't be separated
'll never make another long trip without you and the kids
We'll all be together
Dear heart,  love you
We had the best organization that black people ever had and niggers ruined it

Walk out the back, dear
Hurry
Betty goes

He reassuringly leads the four children, in their pajamas, through the smoke-filled house
There's nothing to be afraid of
It might be a little cold
Hang on
We'll be fine

And the fire hit the window and it woke up my second oldest baby, but the fire burned on the outside of the house
It could have fallen on six-, four-, or two-year-old girls
And 'm going to tell you, if it had done it, 'd've taken my rifle and gone after anybody in sight

' : (contd) For Harlem is where he worked, and where he struggled and fought
His home of homes, where his heart was and where his people are
And it is therefore most fitting that we meet once again in Harlem to share these last moments with him
For Harlem has ever been gracious to those who loved her, have fought for her and defended her honor even to death
It is not in the memory of man that this beleaguered, unfortunate but nonetheless proud community has found a braver, more gallant young champion than this Afro-American who lies before us unconquered still
Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captain and we will smile and we will answer and say unto them: 2OOD   -    -   -  90' Ordinary  in ordinary pursuits of life,   still struggling to stay afloat in a racist   that does not have their best interests at hand -- 8 years of Reagan and now at least 4 years of Bush
