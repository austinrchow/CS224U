We hear

His eyes moving off his belly to: Climax
creature in a bondage of his own devise, he is naked in his underpants, his body criss-crossed by a network of  and 40 tightly pressed plaques of  in every conceivable crevice of his body
The eyes are hard

Pan American Flight 1 to Frankfurt, London, and New York has arrived and will be ready for boarding at Gate 7 in 20 minutes
over: walking down a long
He moves somewhat stuffly in the clothes we saw laid out on the bed; his face complicated by dark, rather ridiculous aviator sunglasses and an increasing edge of nervousness to his actions
With him is: 23, healthy outdoor looks, dressed casually colorful like an American student abroad
- a group of   , in rumpled green uniforms, at a security  inspect the carry-on bags of several
tensely contemplating the guards as he walks

He suddenly breaks stride, still a fair distance from the checkpoint
glances at him
He is holding his belly

And you ate two baclavas, right not to touch them, mine was awful
(his voice strained) Look,  think 'm going to have to go to the john again
You go on through, 'll catch up
With a sense of panic, he turns and goes back down the corridor without waiting for a response
concerned, moves on
: in the   , again checks himself out
His glasses are off, and he has just watered himself down
But the  of his  is up, and his nerves are visible in his eyeballs and he knows it
He dabs at the sweat on his sideburns
He closes his eyes, takes a pause
He puts his dark sunglasses back on
Turns away from the mirror
No going back now

Closer, closer, Guns in their

opens his shoulder bag, proffers it
The  tosses it, pushing aside books, grabbing a white plastic dish
Nebu
(Understand the Turkish expression, "What's this
") It's a frisbee
Nebu
Frisbee

Curious, one of the other  ambles over looking at the frisbee
tightens
Cursing the frisbee
Sweat now runs his sideburns again

2ND American game
Baseball
Ah
(puzzled, turns the Frisbee around and around) studies  curious about the sweat
Suddenly reaches up, indicates the eyes
Take off the glasses
understanding the gesture rather than the words, removes his glasses
His eyes
Straight, staring at the without trying to look away
long moment
stuffs the frisbee back into the bag
Scowls
Takes a puff on his cigarette, coughs
Phlegm rattles around in his throat
Reads the International Herald Tribune, seated on a crowded olive-colored out on the tarmac She has saved him a seat and pulls her bag off as  sits down
Aaaah
He waves  through
puts his glasses walks past the back the turns away
walks past the Checkpoint

Are you all right
He looks at her
Relief
smile, awkward - he wishes he could tell her
Yeah
Yeah
Lays his head back on the wooden bench
Reaches out: in his
She returns the grip
slams shut
rolls the bus out towards the visible in the far distance
, feeling Billy is better, shows him the Herald Tribune
(saddened) 'you see this
Janis Joplin died yesterday
, his sunglasses removed, looks at the paper, almost abstractedly
() Overdose, in a Hollywood motel
Picture of
That big, earthy, rugged smile
'
- Moves Up page One To The Headline: -   : (a faint voice) Never Was anybody like Janis
, thinking other happier things, reaches over and playful
:squeezes her tit twice, rapidly
(smiles) Never was anybody like you
(annoyed, brushes his hand away ,a clicking sound in her throat) You can't take anything seriously
(smiles) You're right
Bus stops suddenly
changes expression
we see   in several drawn up in a semicircle blocking the bus
The Pan American  is directly behind
Also  and a waving the bus down
opens and the Turkish Police  hops aboard briskly: Attention please, Ladies and Gentlemen
For your own safety we're conducting a security check before you board your airplane, Kindly file out the back
Women and children in one line
Men in another
confused hum
What's he saying
don't know
Marian
Hey Marian, what the hell
The Turkish-speaking  are gathering together their items and beginning to exit as: repeats, in Idem
The   is only beginning the speech
in English but already Billy realizes, And it's panic
Silent panic
That horrendous cold feeling all over his back: Oh God what have  done, what can  do now
He freezes
rising, fetching her things, irritated
Jesus, they do everything ass backwards in Turkey
Behind her we see the other   beginning to disembark with the usual chorus of overlapped conversations, expletives, including: They're checking for hijackers
Any Palestinians aboard
Hey Harry, get rid of your grenades
Laughter is returned from several of the American contingent, but we   to  in foreground; all of a sudden he is on his knees trying to crawl under the seat
() Billy, what's the matter
My passport
No
She bends down to look, coming    with him
He grips her arm
(low voice) Susan - forget it
Go get us a seat on the plane
Now
(picking up the real fear in his voice) What is it
Billy
(a fierce whisper, panic) For Christ's sake, just  on the plane, okay
His tone stuns her; never before has he spoken to her like that
between them; he has his glasses off now
She's not a stupid girl by any means and realizes something is very wrong and for the both of them, she'd best do exactly as he says
And fast
She moves
, crouched low in the aisle starts to work fast, his finger: shaking reaching into his sweater starting to work the  loose from around his chest; looking from under the bench
Still quite a bit of commotion as passengers are exiting
: -   coming slowly down Isle Towards him
The muzzle of An -l  tapping loosely Against the side of the kneecap
and   as    comes into view, intersecting outgoing , eyes casually coming to rest on: looks up from his kneeling position on floor; his sweater rolled back down; he indicates the passport in his hand
"Just found it" expression
to the  not necessarily suspecting anything, but with a customary insolence reserved for young vagrant- types, he stretches his rifle arms length with one hand and gently prods Billy up with the tip of the muzzle placed under his chin
to the , bringing the rifle back to his side, indicating Billy get off the bus with the others
All in silence
: among a group of   funnelling into two lines that pass on either side of a wooden inspection table
Thirty   with rifles ring the area
It is open, vast, no place to run or hide
The only apparent hope is to melt into their regular jostling patterns of the passengers impatiently waiting
(Police) are on each side of the table, body-searching the male passengers alternately
is in a similar set-up twenty yards away, with doing the searching
She glances at Billy as she undergoes search
She is cleared, passes on, towards the ramp of the plane
, his sunglasses off, smoothly melts among the male pulling some books from his shoulder bag
Glides to the head of the line
: The   patting down a , his back partially turned to Billy
bringing him into foreground as: skirts him in the background, camouflaged among two other conversing  waiting for the who now appears in foreground on the lateral ; he is busy with another passenger
In passing him, Billy replaces the books in his shoulder bag as though he had already been searched by the first officer, Tension
as he approaches the boarding ramp
-  at the top of the ramp waiting
Smiling
Pan America
Haven
-  rising off Turkish soil onto ramp
lightly touching Billy's elbow, then grasping the
() Just a minute
his eyes flattening
in  , reacting
turns trying to seem casual; he confronts the face to face and gestures towards the: who happens to glance at them
Nebu
Did you search him
(frowns) No
tightens his grip on , angry, and pulls him back to the
with them
The officer has been lied to; in addition he is young, inexperienced, about eighteen
(grunts a command, makes a gesture) , comprehending, spreads his arms
The  pats him down carefully, brushing against his armpits
Precisely in the area where we saw the hashish
But incredibly he doesn't notice, continuing to work his way down the hips and legs
eyes on the sky behind the , praying silently for a break
moving up the inside of his legs, onto his belly, touching the hard bulge below the navel
But again not noticing
in limbo,  of his heartbeat
pausing, his fingers around Billy's chest, about to let it go, then: suddenly flat on Billy's heart
, sensing the accelerated Heartbeat, stares at: whose eyes jump, startled by this technique
like excited spiders quickly run back up into the armpit area
- right on the packets
to
Frozen moment
Then, sudden blur of movement at the edge of frame
jumping back, grabbing his pistol from his holster, crouching on one knee, aiming the gun barrel at , hand shaking
He is terrified
(screaming) Bomb
He's got a bomb
scream and the deck all around
Bomb
Bomb
stands there, arms straight up in the air, eyes clamped shut, trying not to breathe
of rifle and revolver   as: to    surrounded by thirty with rifles pointed at him from all directions, crouched nervously
The  all huddled on the ground
, eyes closed
Edge of frame shows a shaky muzzle a poked into his belly, moving up
to   , older, more experienced but scared, poking with the revolver; reaches in with his hand cautiously, starts to pull up the turtleneck sweater with the hand, revealing the   around the navel
pause
His  draws the sweater higher
More '  relaxes
Starts to smile, finding it funny
(yells out) It's hashish
just a smuggler
() (in chorus echo, relaxing, chuckling) Hashish
smuggler
hippy
starting to rise from the ground
dumbfounded watching all this from the door of the , starts back down the ramp
But a flow of upcoming slows her descent
is led roughly by   parallel to the plane his hands on his head
He manages a glance at Susan slight but strong movement of the head and eyes
'No
Don't come down the stairs' understands it, looks helplessly, hesitates lost between two worlds
silent shaping of a puzzled mouth
Billy
She is washed back along in the flow of passengers
: The scene moves very fast, Indicating  sense of chaos
Much smoke
Many phone calls
Half  dozen Turkish police  Are bizarrely seated In  row of fold up chairs next to  desk
Chattering among themselves ( ) lighting their Turkish cigarettes
They hardly pay attention as: , scared, sweating - backlit by the huge windows overlooking the airstrip
In background, we see the 707 Pan American  beginning to circle towards the runway
have stripped him down to his bare chest and now knife through the adhesive tape from two sides at once
Then  the tape off
winces
the room
Billy's luggage Is being Tossed
Clothes fly through the air
sweatshirt; Marquette University Rowing Team
35mm camera
gift package for his mother ripped open
silver Turkish kettle, clanging To The floor
Another package is ripped open and a set of Turkish tea cups smash and break all over the floor
Very fast
watches, bewildered
He is stripped of the last plaque in of the confusion is that each time another police officer his navel
the plaque clattering onto the pile of forty plaques
() Name
() William Hayes
to the  with notebook at the desk
Part of the confusion is that each time we see another police officer we see he has another face
Vi
Vilyum
Vilyum
() Hayes
Hi-yes
(writes it down) -- 'Merican
(nods) New York
The  is puzzled
New York
New York
Ahhhh
Nev Yok
(writes it down) The  flies open and   strides in
Paunchy, moustached
The room is suddenly silent as we him in, followed by a grinning civilian  with a big portable photo instrument and bulb
jumps up from the desk, makes an obsequious salute to the   who arrogantly acknowledges it and takes the vacated chair behind the desk
The   moves to the first fold-up chair in the row, pushing the police officer in that chair further down
, in turn, shoves the next man down
It goes all the way down the line like a comedy until the last man in the row stands up against the wall
But this is all in the background as: Name
William Hayes
Vil
Vilyum
Hayes
Sharp   of
He darts a look at stretching the undeveloped film out
Another loud  , interrupting this-- flies open again and a   strides in, obviously the most important yet, because the jumps up from the desk, and all the others immediately move down one seat in the hierarchy without a moment's hesitation
But the   strides right up to Billy, waves to the
in background bubbles with enthusiasm, sliding into position
Billy is puzzled - what's going on
His arm is grabbed and he is swivelled around
- in the middle, flanked by  and  , grinning like big game hunters, their arms on his shoulders
The  , sticking a bunch of hashish plaques into Billy's hands, runs
looks from side to side
The   pats him hard on the back of the head, meaning 'look at camera'
glances at him, sees the grin on both the officers' faces
Thinking this is the necessary expression, he grins at the camera
disgustedly looks up from his eyepiece
No
He's smiling
Make him look miserable
slugs  in the stomach with a quick back-handed fist
groans, sinks to his knees
The plaques fall on the floor
(running up) Gel
Gel
He growls, grabbing Billy's arm and hauling him up, gathering the hashish plaques and putting them back in his arms
The   put their arms back on Billy's shoulders
, in pain, makes the proper expression of misery
The bulb goes
: 707   , destination New York, roars up into the sky
all the way to  sitting next to the window, huddled over, feeling woozy and near vomiting
He glimpses the plane but it is anti-climatic now; as he stares down at his boots
Then remembers something
Surprised
-
The Turkish  talk among themselves, congratulating, slapping shoulders, pointing to the hashish plaques, etc
In center background, we see  submissively lifting his arm for permission to speak, nods, approaches, followed by
slowly, partly out of pain, pulls off one of his boots, bangs it on the heel and two more  clatter to the floor
drop open
finishes the process with the other boot
An awkward silence
(trying to explain, innocent) forgot
really did
(makes ineffective gestures) The room explodes with screams and commotion
: (screaming at ) You idiot, you fool
You told me the American was searched
and he's pulling hashish out of his boots
You're all dogshit
(turning on First Officer, screaming) You worthless piece of garbage, where did you learn to search a prisoner
He's been in our custody for an hour, etc
(screaming at the others) Who searched him
Who
Amid all the screaming   rush over and yank upwards, and start to strip all his clothes
(protesting) That's it
That's all  have
: spread-eagled   against the wall
He is afraid to move
strange silence
naked in center
against the wall
The  and  quietly leering at his trim, muscular buttocks
Hungry stares
Bisexuality is prevalent in Turkey
But there is also embarrassment among the officers; none would do anything openly in front of the others; instead they just stare and smoke their cigarettes
Low murmurs
Continued telephone calls
Much thick smoke all over the room
Another  opens
Obsequious  in Turkish
is afraid to look over his shoulder, feeling enormously humiliated
() Howdy, Billy
Howya doing, Ok
perfect Texas drawl
glances over his shoulder
Sees: a tall, lanky blonde-haired American in a business suit with boots
Clean cut, very handsome, with a strong flavour of danger in his blue eyes
(smiling, extends Billy's clothes) think these gentlemen have finished for the time being if you'd like to put your clothes on
- , so grateful at last to see a fellow American, reaches quietly for the clothes, his eyes never leaving Tex
Release
: sits at the main desk in the room
Unlike the others, he has no moustache; a skeletal face, intelligent looking
Is behind, leaning casually up against the wall
Angled to Billy's side is the entire array of seated  looking on like a tribunal
(thickly accented English, sympathetic) Are you afraid, Vilyum
, standing to the side of the desk, clothed now, buckling his belt - afraid
No, 'm not afraid
Good
There's nothing to be afraid of
If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow
yes
(softly, hoping) Yes
Good
Now, where did you get the hashish
cabdriver
He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar
Would you recognize him again
Yes
think so
Good
Would you go back to the Pudding Shoppe now and point him out to my men if you see him
'   : who makes a cool affirmative nod of the eyes to Billy
() Yes
, ,
drives his American ; in the passenger seat; in the rear seats
Various   of the city
(casual tone) You decided to fly at a bad time Billy Palestinian Guerrillas all over the place blowing up planes and all
(shakes his head) Stupid
Four planes in four days
but guess you kids don't read the newspapers
and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got
But didn't have heroin
(grins) Well 'm not up on all that drug's a drug seems to me Billy and
(sweating) But it was my first time
'm not really a smuggler, was just two kilos
Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos
The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade
But just
Just what
just needed some extra money was broke, the guy offered me the hash and
It sounds bad
Tex looks at him without expression
Pause
Billy tries to sense a sympathy in this ambiguous man, a liking towards himself
But feels nothing yet, except someone who can speak English
are you with the Consulate
(not looking at him) Something like that
Cigarette
-  nervously takes the pack and matches
How much you pay this joker
this cab driver
Two hundred dollars
It was my last two hundred
How much did you figure to make
fumbles to light up his cigarette
He is nervous, grateful to volunteer any information
anything
Three, four thousand
don't know
The guy offered me the hash-- (shakes his head) it just seemed like easy money
Beats working
was just going to sell it to friends
'm not a pusher, honest
grins, sceptical of his naivete, changing the subject
Got a family back there
(inhales deeply) Yeah
Parents, brother, sister
Babylon, Long Island
What's your father do
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life
(a pause, not looking at Billy) Be tough on 'em
nods, takes a deep drag on his cigarette
Girlfriend
She was on the plane
Tex glances at him, questioningly
She didn't know anything about wouldn't have wanted her to
Lucky girl
Billy leans back in seat, blowing out the cigarette smoke
Jeez, she used to say  was the lucky one
Let's hope so, Billy
Let's sure hope so
narrow cobblestone
pulls the car to a halt
: Internationally-known cafe, adjacent
Crowded, noisy
dressed in black hold crying  by the hands
, mostly students and hippies, move about laughing, joking
Hawkers, street peddlers, vendors cooking shishkebab
small leads a huge   on a leash
sits at a small outdoor  alone sipping tea and eating baclava - nervous, very nervous, still trying to sort it all out in his head
If he doesn't find the seller, what will happen next

They look evident
make a wide berth around them
() (in passing, low) Hey Janet, why don't you go sell 'em some dope

Many tables

to #2   to  #3
to #1 and again to #2 indicating no real fix on identity
tense now, knowing this is the chance he must take, nods with his head, pointing at  #2, off
move out towards  #2
tentatively rises, as if to join them, but moves slyly towards the interior of the cafe
move in roughly on a surprised #2 who begins to protest  ( )
moves through the  of the  , past the tables, past the stairs, towards the back of the shop, at a normal

Pause
with  moves into  pointing a six-inch barrel right at his temple
freezes, moving just his eyes to: looking down at him calm, merciless
You seem like a nice enough kid to me Billy, but try it and 'll blow your fucking brains out

-
large and Byzantine structure suggesting the 15th Century Sultan's Janissary Barracks
Irregular crescent various wings; a  inside the prison
The possibly a shapes to the sense of an endless a decorative an equally in a city, labyrinth built by some mad Arab architect to suit purpose and now, in the 20th Century, transformed by mad Turkish bureaucracy into a prison
It should be preferably made to look like Istanbul

Evening Muslim prayer
"Allah wakbah, Allah wakbah

Dear Mom and Dad
This is the hardest letter 've ever had to write
know the confusion and the pain it will cause you
And the disappointment
- his scalp being shaved off by a prison  in an un-specified -, His eyes are staring dead ahead
(continuous) really thought knew what  was doing with my life
'd hoped somehow to get out of this quickly so that you'd never know about it
But that just isn't possible now
don't know what's going to happen
But what can  say to you
Will ''m sorry' make a difference
Will it ease the pain, the shame you must be feeling
Forgive me
Please
is now completely ,   : : steps in, bewildered
() Git
The cell is dark, almost black, an overpowering stench; a small grey metal bunk is bolted to the floor with a lumpy mattress
turns, looking back at the man staring at him from the door
is quickly summing up Billy's character
This is his craft
He is a prisoner and trustee
sinister man whose one motivation in life is the accumulation of money, in the pursuit of which he has acquired an ugly purplish running the width of his throat, various other facial ; and one blind milky white
He's stocky and strong -- about five ten, with bushy eyebrows, brown cigarette teeth, big dirty nails, repulsively in need of a bath
What's surprising is that he is no more than thirty years old looks and behaves like sixty
The personification of the denaturalization of a man
Time, body, mind - all of them warped
, not yet attuned to his nature, only repulsed, is still wearing his own clothes and makes a shivering gesture, enunciating very clearly, hoping he will understand
Cold
Very cold
Can  get blanket
Blanket
(makes a gesture of a blanket wrapped around him) smiles, showing his stained teeth, and starts to slide shut the cell door on its
(in English) Mo sell
Too late
Tomorrow
cobra smile flashes, as the cell door bangs shut
(through the bars) You be here tomorrow
"Ayi Gedjaler"("good night") Goes
walks around the cell, hugging himself for warmth
() Pssst
stops, goes to the edge of the cell
motions from the bars of the cell next to his
We never see the face but hear a thick  , hoarse and cracked
() (Whispering) Your cell, no key
Open
Blanket
Three cell down
You get me one
Take
Extends a stick with a big nail pounded into the end, twisted over to form a hook
takes it
Hesitates
() Ziat go for night
Go
cautiously slides the cell door open, amazed that it's been left open
Nothing makes any sense to him in this labyrinth -  steps out into a
bare bulb overhead casts light
He glides past the three cells, seemingly empty
Finds the cell with blankets, sheets, towels and various supplies stacked inside
But it's locked
He slips the stick in between the bars and stretching, hooks the first blanket
asleep with the blankets pulled up to his chin
Suddenly   reach into frame and rip the blanket off
: (tugging the sheet, growls) Brack
Brack
Then  at
ducks away
Encouraged, steps up closer to him, sticks his fingers in his chest screaming
You, goddamn you, give me sheet
Give me
And feints as if to hit  again
reacts to defend himself, pushing  off and jumping out of the bunk
, Enraged by the shove, comes back at , screaming, arms flailing like a bear to pummel him, but , not understanding the Turkish bluster in his mannerisms, meets him with a sharp right  into the front of his face
staggers back, startled into silence; he has misjudged this kid
waits, ready for the fight in the defensive position
The guy is bigger than himself
, however, now feels the blood from his mouth and nose and freaks out, running out of the cell  at the top of his lungs as if he's dying
: is blindfolded, stumbling down stone steps pushed by a , into a dungeon-like basement room : removes the blindfold
, adjusting to the light, stares around
The cell is spartan, with a series of pulleys and primitive bondage devices hanging from the cobwebbed ceiling
opens and: in, lowering his head to get through the door
Chief of the guards
clean uniform
Four stripes
The only guard to carry a holstered gun
very frightening man
He is about six two, two forty, and muscular, and moves lightly like a fighter on his feet
His skull is bullet-shaped and completely shaven like Billy's, Enhancing this effect, he has no eyebrows, and his pale blue eyes (suggesting a trace of Indo-European stock in his ancestry) are set deep in his skull somewhat like turtle eyes, giving nothing away
His nose is a beak of skin his neck broad, his mouth a small crescent that moves as lightly as his feet between anger and amusement
He approaches , looks into his eyes, drawing out the moment for himself, enjoying the tension and the fear he instils in others
meets his eyes respectfully, then realizing this is perhaps not the thing do to, looks away
But, fascinated by the man's features beyond his self-control, he looks back
, amused by eye actions, smiles thinly
The sort of smile that could imply friendship such is its hint of charm
(to one of the guards) Name
(checking a clipboard) Vilyum Hi-yes (looking at , repeating it) Vilyum Hi-yes
And slowly his hand moves up to caress the edge of his hairless upper lip
An erotic gesture in Turkey
Vilyum Hi-yes "Its in my memory locked
"  He slowly extends his right arm stiff out to his side
watches, fascinated
lets the arm linger; then: across the face with an open palm shoots back: and smashes against the wall just from the force of one blow
Stunned
advances, taking a wooden  ( ) about feet three long and three inches wide from a
scared, emphasizing the words, trying to make himself understood
It was cold
Cold
get blanket
Blanket
Cold
'  , where the faluka stick has just smashed him behind the kneecap
He  going down
looks up from the floor: with his club in hand
(In some sort of English, smiles) No do
No do
Raises the club
tries to block it with his hand, and the  smashes his thumb
: is hoisted upside-down in his   with thick rope tied about his ankles, the legs spread - onto a suspended from the ceiling
He is yanked upwards, then lowered slightly, his head and backs of shoulders banging against the stone floor
is  into place
( ) has this surprised look on his face still, through the tears
What's happening
Hamidou motions the  out of the room ( )
Turns back to , raises his club
on the soles of '
He cocks the club again
twists To avoid The blow catches him On The SCREAMs louder than ever as we hear The  of wood On bone
Whimpering  follow
looking through teary eyes, sure now that he is going to be killed
The  -  - smacks sole skin with the same force as the first blow
No let up
: still in the same position, vomits all over himself
the  to a new position bringing: into a steeper, more vertical position
He is on the verge of fainting, bleary-eyed, looking as: moves around in between his legs
Doing something indistinct with the stick between his legs, then dropping the stick
Then, with this bizarrely excited expression on his hairless face, he begins to undo his own pants
But, for Billy, it all   : depicting a fat jovial Buddhist monk, fishing placidly by a stream
Then moves to soap carvings of chess pieces Then a bed-sheet hung as a curtain with astrological symbols paint; on it
, of a blaring radio
Atonal
(close, intense) Hey man, he's gotta walk, or his feet gonna swell up worse
2ND (softer, sonorous, Swedish accent) We take him down to courtyard
Then:  - a gentle long bird's face
Long whitish-blond- hair, Swedish, well above six feet, 25
Another  moves into view  , American, 23 fiery eyes, black hair and moustache, intense, strong
Smoke this rocket, it'll cool the pain
-  puts a huge cone-shaped  with aluminium foil filter into '
He hardly knows what it is, Puffing weakly
Though dehydrated and his face white without color, he has no facial markings
You gotta walk around some man, or your feet gonna swell up something bad
looks down at Bloated black and blue with inflamed red points in various spots
vicious bruise on his anklebone is running a cold rag from a basin of water over them, his fingers tender
() You've been out for days man, talking all kinds of shit
Come on, we'll walk you down to the courtyard

Okay

They rise together, bracing his shoulder
adjusting to the sensation of standing
How's it feel
(dizzy) About as good as it looks
Getchmis olsun Getchmis

This is Erich something Swedish
(smiling) Just Erich

At least  used to be
Looks around
with 24 bunk beds set head to head in horizontal fashion, cramped and with minimal privacy narrow  leading towards a   and
Looks like a cheap hotel
Yeah
Only the room service is lousy
Come on, let me show you the tennis courts

Chief of the Guards
Don't fuck with him
He almost killed an Italian dude couple months ago
Bad news
He try anything with you

Pause
No

Glances at
With these fucking Turks, soon as the light goes out
keep one hand on their feet and their feet better not grow
You'll meet Max
He got raped something bad down in Section 13
That's the pits
The yard is 30 by 50 paces with a wall 20 feet high
Cigarette butts, orange peels crumpled news- papers, rocks, sticks, broken glass litter the place
No guards are on the walls; the only  are unarmed inanimate lumps of boredom who look as helpless as the prisoners with whom they intermingle; they have raggedy olive green uniforms and worn boots (they make $1 a month, augmented by bribes)
On one side of the yard is a 2-story (cellblock) with barred windows from which Billy and his two companions have just emerged
On the other side of the yard is another 2-story  (the children's kogus)
The  is colorful, almost like a bazaar, about 8O people in it - groups of exotically dressed , , , , , and predominantly pacing back and forth talking in little circles, hawking wares, trading illegal currencies
Screaming Turkish   10-14 years old, share the space playing soccer and volleyball with a surprising viciousness, continually hitting each other and cursing bunch of them vehemently lay bets on the soccer game
Other aspects of the prison which should become evident: 1)  - continuous, Loud
Radios, Turkish music, screaming, shouting
2)  - all kinds, some of them pets, some stray, tolerated because they kill the rats
3) all wear their own clothing; the foreigners preferring jeans, clip-clops, sneakers, Sweat suits
4) of only the new prisoners are shaved, then allowed to grow back
5)   have physical disabilities
Carbuncles on the back from wet mattresses
Boils on the lymph glands around the neck, buttocks, under-arms, sometimes  painful the victim walks with his arms up in the air
Arthritic in the knees, hips, ankles
Fungus on the feet
Many limp

The kids
Why are they

Don't trust any of 'em

The kids push and punch each other to get the tea faster

Sells watered- down tea, blankets, hash, black money, nembutols --anything for a buck

He wears a colorful flowing robe, various scarves, turban, trinkets, rings, baggy pants, and pointed curved shoes, and makes emphatic violent gestures at  with his mutilated
Seems to speak something of his language and bargains back

Watch him, he's a fox
says nothing to them about the Ziat incident, sizing him up for himself

Yeah, what do you think this is, the good
This is Turkey, man
(laughs bitterly)) It's a fucking accident here if you're innocent
And anyway
ain't nobody who's innocent
- all the color and breath seems to have gone from
(his English is halting but has a calming effect) Don't pay too much attention, anything is possible in Turkey
You might get bail
snorts, amused, kicking the   away hard as it dribbles towards them
If you make bail, you're free
You can get a fake passport or sneak across the border to Greece
The Greeks hate the Turks so much they never send you back
The Turks know it
They just keep the bail
money
Sure, keep dreaming and see where that gets you
like Max, up in the head, you know
(makes a crazy signal towards the head) You gonna eat a lot more fasoulia beans, Billy baby, 'fore you taste a hamburger 'gain cause you broke the law man, and you got caught
(grins) And that
is history
The law is sometimes wrong
(eyes feverish) The Law is never wrong, asshole
The Law is

deep anger inside him looks at  who is quiet; by way of apology
New people sometimes get on his nerves

He was caught steeling from a Mosque
That's heavy here
He got 30 years
Thirty years
Jimmy has more balls than brains
He didn't tell his parents he was in jail for a year and a half
He says he got himself in and now he's going to get himself out
He shakes his head, looking at: him across the courtyard huddling with a cigarette, bartering angrily
a raggedy  giving him a cigarette, bartering angrily
and
And you
Hashish
Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish
They walk
What they give you
(passive) Twelve years
Billy stops
How much did you have
hundred grams
(appalled) It's not fair
Even  has to smile now
There is no fair in Turkey, Billy
It's all "sula-bula" like this, like that
An Italian hippie had a car accident and a Turk was killed
, they threw him in here for six months
That doesn't seem so bad
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself
He wasn't even in the car
(shakes his head) Aslan, there
(points) - a young big fat heavily moustached Turk, wearing a black silk double-breasted business suit, grotesque cuff- links, heavily pomaded hair, is huddling in a section of the  with  other grinning  , all in suits
() Killed a guy
But his father's a big gangster on the docks "Kapidiye
"  He'll stay in
twelve months no more, and get parole
In Turkey, murder is manly - "erkek"
Glances back at You just got to get yourself a good lawyer
And some money
Talk to Max
He's been in the longest
How long
Seven years
: - "Eskilet" (skeleton)
British, tall, straggly long hair with wire spectacles set crookedly over his nose
An earing in one ear
The far away eyes of an international junkie, preoccupied and uninterested in small talk
Tough in his skinny way, like apiece of old dried leather
He occupies with his    a bunk in the far corner of the    - in the process of shooting himself up with "Gastro" a smelly brown liquid stomach medicine
No one is in the vicinity except and  who watches repelled as  fumbles with a piece of twine tied around his arm in a tourniquet, searching for an unused spot amid dirty infected track marks
the needle in, pumping in the black gunk
Glances at
(smiles) Gastro
Stomach medicine
Has codeine in it
Best can do Pulls out the needle, loosens the tourniquet
His eyes take on a far away stare
Lawyers
Yeah
there's no straight lawyers in Turkey
They're all bent bent as hairpins
Gives a spoon with a taste of the black residue to: who is full of spunk, and tries to catch Max's He looks at , not remembering him
His name

The lawyer

He sits on his bunk
What lawyer
Who got the Frenchman out
Oh Yesil
Yesil's his name but don't know anything

, still bewildered, his bruised feet almost back to normal, limps in warily eyeing  who follows
, the lawyer, fleshy, grinning, thin black hair heavily greased, sits at a conference table
Standing adjacent is  , the
Consul - eyeglasses, striped tie, neat summer suit with stripes, trimmed hair, ivy league look, his eyes moving from Billy to: , late 50's white hair, blue-eyed New York Irishman
suburban insurance agent, rumpled suit, an anxious look on his face
Moving towards  fast: Billy
embrace; the father's left hand grabbing Billy's arm tightly as if never to let go
Dad
looks on, intrigued by the Father and Son; leaves silently, closing the door
looks into his son's eyes, his own eyes moistening
He looks tired, pain all over his face
looks down
Dad
'm
(voice quivering) Don't worry about it
(managing a smile) can punch you in the nose later
Right now we've got to get you out of here
You all right
(eyes moistening) Yeah
How's Mom
Bad
She couldn't make the trip
You know Her boy
(breaks off) Susan told us before we got your letter
She's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but
No, don't let her
'll
How about Peg
Robbie
Same
None of the neighbors know
We told them you were in a hospital in Europe
Oh
this is Stanley Davis
He's the American Consul here
And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted
(shaking hands) Hello, Billy
Hello
The professional smile from the Consul, but in the handshake and the eye contact,  is cool
The unanswered question: Where were you before my father arrived
want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible
Believe me
Thank you
moves forward
unctuous
bubbling with high spirits, profusely shaking 's hand, exuding confidence in fractured English, Vilyum,  am Necdit Yesil
Mr
Yesil
know exactly what you feel but you must not worry, we are acting immediately, we get the right court, the right judge,   arrange everything - just right
And think we get you bail
If very bad, maybe twenty month sentence
But  think we get you bail
Pause,  looks at him wondering how to take him in
(reassuringly) You know  have lectured at the University of Maryland in your country
Also University Michigan Very nice country
We both go back
(smiles) (trying to concentrate) If  get bail, Mister Yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into Greece
(pacing up, hungry) Right
That's what we're shooting for
Mister Davis and have been in contact with the State Department, but right now relations with the Turks aren't too good, Nixon's upset the hell out of them
Our best bet's
right here
Dad
(pauses, glances at Davis and Yesil, embarrassed) 'll pay you back for all this, Promise
Don't worry about it
Right now money doesn't count
Okay
pause
Shifts, Throats are cleared
moves to sit down, limping faintly; he is wearing sneakers and the bruises don't show
Where'd you get that limp
(not wanting to alarm him) Nothing
Just twisted my ankle
Sits down at the conference
Where you staying, Dad
(pulls up a seat next to Billy) The Hilton
How do you like it
Istanbul
Well, it's an interesting place
(lowers his voice, a hint of a smile) Tell you the truth,  think the food is lousy
The crap they sell in these little restaurants went out to eat in one of them last night, and  had to run to the damn toilet
You shoulda' seen the toilet
laughs
You mean you got toilets
is happy to see his son laugh
Yeah, with real toilet paper - and you don't have to use both sides
laughs again
So now 'm eating at the Hilton every night
smiles
pause
worried look returns to the Father's face Why'd you do it, Billy
For the money
(Looks away)) (sighs) know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy
Stupid
know
Glances at ,  back to his father, his voice beginning to tremble, ashamed of himself for letting it show
Dad get me out of here
The  understands the desperation in his voice, puts his hand on his son's
promise you, Billy
Just sit tight and don't
' do anything stupid
Let me work with Mr
Yesil and Mr
Davis
We'll get you out
Okay
Billy, okay
All the assurance of the world is written in this kindly Irishman's face
feels it
being led by   down a huge arched in the
Okay
: () world is now looking at Turkey
We are called the Heroin Supplier of the world
Stories about us are in newspapers and on television every day all around the world
The time has come, your Honor, to alter this image before we find ourselves isolated and morally ostracized by the rest of the human race
- monolithic, frightening, immense with cross- currents of greenish light from the enormous windows
People seem insignificant
, wearing dark green glasses, continues, scowling, gesturing profusely at: in the  , baroque design, isolated
Doesn't understand a thing, Erich's extra-large blue pin- striped suit makes him look rather absurd

from the Press with a yellow legal pad, makes notes in the Spectator Gallery
Her legs flare out from a short skirt
pries his eyes away to: continuing in front of the   high on an Alice in Wonderland podium wearing long black robes with scarlet collars
One of the Judges is bald, the other has his eyes closed, could be asleep
The   in the middle has a sagging somewhat kindly face and short grey hair
below the podium, is clacking at an ancient typewriter on a small table
() (continuous) We must alter this image by punishing only our own drug smugglers-but by handing out foreigners who infest our culture with their depravity ungodly and behavior
We must start now - by sentencing this American, Vilyum Hi-yes, to the maximum sentence for smuggling, to be held up to the light of the world as an example of Turkish justice and its intention to halt the drug trade once and for all
ask the Court therefore to sentence Vilyum Hi-yes to Life Imprisonment
He sits, staring malignantly at
rise
Thank you, Prosecutor
The Court will now recess to consider its verdict
The  exit
, General commotion in the courtroom as people move about
The  and  and the consult among themselves, the  vigorously nodding his head
approaches
leans forward anxiously in the dock
What'd the Prosecutor say
(hurried) It's not important, just technical things
We make our case
You were very good, you spoke well
The Judge like you
It look good
Don't worry
(pressing) Did you ask for bail
But  is called over by the other  and hurries off
comes over and sits  down
: puts on his glasses, stands to read the verdict
, standing with the , motions  to rise
rises, tense
looks over at him, manages a reassuring smile
continuing, after preliminaries: The Defendant has been found guilty by the Court of the illegal possession of Hashish
, his expression souring, makes a gesture of defeat
We wanted a conviction for smuggling, not possession
, not understanding sees the Prosecutor's gesture, and a hint of hope crosses his expression
puts the paper away, looks at  directly
Therefore
this court sentences you, Vilyum Hi-yes to be imprisoned at Sagamilcar Prison for a term of four years and two months
This Case is now closed
looking at the  doesn't understand
Thinks he might be free
But suddenly   move in, and start chaining his hands together
He is bewildered, looking at: hastily conferring with Billy's , more concerned about making a good impression with him than with Billy
Four years, two months
It's good
(stunned) Four years
(quickly) We appeal it
watching this, a lost look
is too shocked to do anything but look at  who continues on: You will see, he will have maybe one year taken off this sentence for good behaviour
Remember, it is only for possession; the prosecutor wanted life sentence for smuggling
(a smile) To be honest Mr
Hayes, it is a great victory
is forcibly removed from the  - in chains
: , in the same  , (embarrassed) With good time Billy it works out to about 3 years
then there's the appeal
Yesil, Davis, they're all working for you We're going to try to make a deal to get you transferred to a Stateside prison
And Davis thinks there might be a political amnesty any month
Stops
Knows it sounds bad
looks down
Look -  know it sounds tough, Billy, but we're gonna get you out
grips  by the arm hard
promise you, but  don't want you to get stupid again
Pull anything
They can play with your sentence
nods, acquiescent
(his voice starting to crack) 'm putting $500 in the bank for you
Anything you need you write
nods
His  points to a stack of  on the conference table, picks up a cigarette carton
There's food, candy, writing paper, soap, books
(his eyes start to water) cigarettes, soap, tooth-brush, there's
Jesus
(cracks, throws down the cigarette carton) been writing insurance policies on people for thirty goddamn years
(laughs and cries at the same time) And now  gotta see my own son
Jesus
Jesus
If  could be where you are Billy, 'd be there
Goddamn Jesus
These bastards
is on the verge of tears
Oh Jesus
(sobbing) enters the room
morbid curiosity in his expression about this show of grief
Watches a few moments, then indicating the visit is over, he taps his falaka stick lightly a few times on the hollow door
breaks the embrace with , tears streaking his cheeks
Silently indicates for him to "Go, go Fast
" goes, past shaking his finger at You take good care of my boy, you hear, or 'll have your fucking head, you Turkish bastard
It sputters out of his mouth, senseless to: who closes the door
He has an angry glint in his eye
: lies on his bunk at night deeply depressed, paler
Candlelight flutters softly against the stone walls of  taken outdoors with a mountain range in the background, is on his wall with various   of little chess piece she has designed
In the distance, very faintly coming upwards into our sound consciousness we hear a   in the night, on an old railroad track bypassing the prison walls
Two whistles
Chugging
Then passing off
The Midnight Express

: Volleyball game in progress

is fast, agile
is muscular, intense, his hits power-packed
' (continuous) In the daytimes we sometimes play volleyball against the big Turkish gangsters
they play against are hilarious looking in this context, moving like big clumsy bears, waving their arms and screaming at each other, disorganized
Ever conscious of fashion, they have their jackets and vests off but play in their Elvis Presley shirts rolled up at the sleeves, shiny slacks, black pointed pumps
The boys wear shorts and sneakers
On the sidelines we see a group of laying bets and shouting encouragement
leaps up for a ball close to the net and as the backs off, he dinks the ball in just over the net; the Turk  his teammates scream at him
: goes up for another ball close to the net and really it with all his might, and: bangs right into the eye of a  who flails his arms and  with pain, very theatrical

You know why
Because that's what they use to wipe their asses with instead of toilet paper
And yet they hate pigs
There are no pigs in Turkey
They're considered dirty
, smirking at the Turk, turns and walks away
(continuous) So is homosexuality
That's a big crime here but most of them do it every chance they get
There are about a thousand things that are "ayip"
But they're really so hypocritical, like children breaking the rules
For instance
Suddenly a   and: runs up, pulling a sharp  from his pants, and using the cloth as a handle he repeatedly   in the ass and backs of his thighs
One, two, three, four, five  , like a cook hammering veal
In spite of its violence, the action seems like slapstick
tumbles to the ground, crying out
stashes the shiv and disappears among his , his honor restored
and  run over to help  who is obviously more in pain than in danger
(continuous) You can stab or shoot some body the but not above the waist because that's intent to kill
So everybody runs around stabbing everyone else in the ass
That's what they call 'Turkish revenge'
There's also a lot of "Baksheesh" that's a favorite Turkish word for bribery
-  and  the young fat Turkish gangster pointed out previously by Erich, are taking tea together in the    alone except for  and Hamidou's two  , 7 and 8 years old, both dressed in little suits listening politely as Hamidou gestures to them, in couched terms
The voices are distant and, after a few beats,  ' : Unfortunately my youngest son Arief is having problems with his teeth; he needs braces, but dentists are so expensive these days (patting Arief on the head) Poor kid
You know  have a friend, a very good friend; he's a dentist; maybe he could get you some braces at a
reasonable price

Yes
Please
As a favour

Aslan of course has a friend who's a dentist
They bullshit for half an hour and Hamidou finally accepts the "Baksheesh" in return

Then another comes over, lands in the yard

Then silence

- silently walks over and gently picks up the corpse in his arms, starts to walk out
: listening impassively to: the lawyer
They are in a booth in the Bars separate prisoner and visitor
(smiling) The new American Ambassador here is following your case very closely
He says there is progress
But there is another route that is quite possible
(lowers his voice and leans close) For the proper amount of money it is possible  can convince certain officials to lose track of your papers before the High Court in Ankara confirms the sentence of the Lower Court in Istanbul
You would not exist; and you could be in Greece by the time the Turkish courts discovered a stupid clerical mistake
But  have to act before the official sentence is handed down, and for that  must pay certain officials in advance
closes his eyes as '  drones on, explaining the details, the cast, the simplicity Of it, : walking the  counting his paces 48, 49, 50 Turns, goes back
' My dearest Billy
know it is long and it is hard for you, but your family and  are thinking about you all the time
am trying hard to make enough money nights to come and see you
Your father says that lawyer Yesil wants another $2000
know you distrust him more and more, but your father wants to do everything he can, and he is borrowing all he can on the mortgage of the house
Money seems to be the only way out of there
Except of course the other way
,  and  (bandaged around the ass from the stabbing) are huddled around 's  late  candle burning, a sheet sealing off some of the kogus
Bell furtively looks around, pulling out and elaborately unfolding a set of  from a pack of letters
' (continuous) But  cannot say  am for it
Nor are your parents
They consulted the priest, and he said to send you money for that reason would be like sealing your death
(excited) The blueprints
To what
The prison, man
There was this German cat an architect in the hospital
He was helping the Turks build some shit round the place
laid some bread on him and he let me copy them
, puzzled, turns the drawings upside-down, sideways
are a lunatic mess of scrambled lines, dots, crosses
and , trying to follow the map, look at each other dubiously
Too bad you didn't have a machine
(intent) There's two ways out  figger - over the roof, but that's only one person, maybe two
The other way is Under
Tunnel
(grins) It's already built
There's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the Christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead
We're sitting right on top of it -- here
, illustrating roughly the structure of the prison
His  tracing, bubbling with nervous enthusiasm
() The Kraut said there's a whole bunch of hollow sealed shafts sort of like dumbwaiters running along this wall; one of them is right in there, right next to our shower
We get in there, he says, we can get down into the catacombs
With three of us working
(stops) is standing, tapping on the wall, listening, a funny look on is face
Gotta be here someplace
Thought heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there
(irritated) Stop shitting me, man
(trying to be serious) But how would you get into the shaft, Jimmy
suppose you knock three times and ask for St
Peter
(turning on Max) Hey
'm getting this together man and  don't need no fucking Gastro-head along on this trip
(a fierce look at Max then back to Billy) We go through the wall
(a resigned look on his face) We go through the wall
(quite sure Bell is out of his skull) We go through the wall
between  and  walking in the continuing intently: The Kraut was right
checked it out - there's no reinforced steel in those bath walls
They're real soft from underground seepage-- reaches the wall, turns around and continues Lowers his voice occasionally as other  intersect them
(gesturing profusely) --the water like "'weeps" through the cement, see
Twenty, thirty years, you can almost push it over
All we do is use Gastrohead's screwdriver here and scrape the mortar out
Pull out 2, 3 stones, squeeze through, put 'em back, and get our ass down the shaft, It's a two night operation, maybe three
And what do you do when you in the catacombs
The catacoombs
Whaddya want, a door
There's miles of em like a sewer system but they got to come up someplace in Istanbul
Max is fed up with it now, no longer joking
You gotta be fucking crazy
You got stabbed in the ass once too much, sweetheart, cause you're gonna end up in Section 13, that's what - not the 'catacombs
Section 13
(looking at Bell) Yeah,  for the criminally insane
(looks at Billy) was there once for two weeks and it ain't an illusion
It's awful
Namidou runs it like a death camp, that's where he spends most of his time
Where is it
don' t know
It's someplace down in there
(points at the ground) deep
big door
a wheel
His eyes go back in time, haunted, vague breaks off
(low-keyed) Hey, you know what's gonna get us out of here
It's not a map, Max
It's our balls
You know what mean
(straight at Max, Billy, very sincere, his eyes almost watering) gotta get laid man,  don't know 'bout you guys, but if  don't get it on soon, 'm
'm not gonna make it
(under his breath) Shit
Billy
The roof sounds better to me than digging through a wall
Ziat's round there all the time
But the roof
(looks up) -  , its edges visible over the courtyard
shakes his head
The bullet percentage is awful high
pause
looks away from ' stare
If  get caught, Jimmy, 'm facing another months
'd be back up to 3 years, maybe more
Looks down
understands, deeply disappointed
Well fuck it
Choose your own death, babe, 'm taking the roof out of here

we reach it
The door and  is glimpsed lighting a cigarette
Like a surreal dream, his hand holding the match has a thick bound around its knuckles and blood speckled on his fingers

His face contorting in agony
' Dear Susan
Poor Jimmy was caught and beaten so badly he got a severe hernia and lost a testicle

He has convinced me to stop smoking hashish, he is the calmest man have ever known

And you can't waste it either
You have to weigh up every one of your actions - for and against
Too little sex, too much sex either will throw you off balance

Sit down a moment, Billy

Something happen to Dad
Mom
swallows hard, not to say it No
It looks like your going to have a new court
What do you mean
The Prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the High Court in Ankara reviewed it
And
We've been notified that they rejected the sentence
Billy's face drains of all expression
(continuing) There were 35 judges on the High Court
Twenty eight of them voted for a life sentence
'
Numb, dazed, surreal
() The Lower Court in Istanbul will have to go along with the decision
The Judge likes you and he'll do the only thing he can do under the law
He'll reduce the sentence to thirty years
We're notified
Billy
Suddenly he is  by his ivy-league striped tie and his face is yanked up to the bars, his glasses falling off
is berserk, his face right up against the bars, Davis tight
What do you mean

Please
Commotion  as  run in,  in the lead

He has red bar marks across his face and is absent-mindedly trying to adjust half a tie as he looks at: being hauled out by ,  something indistinct
: Same as before
, in the prisoner's dock, addresses the Court; as he speaks, a Turkish
drones underneath his voice level: What is the crime
And what is the punishment
The answer seems to vary from place to place, and from time to time
What's legal today is suddenly illegal tomorrow cause some society says it's so; and what's illegal yesterday all of a sudden gets legal today because everybody's doing it and you can't throw everybody in jail
Well 'm not saying this is right or wrong
It's just the way things are
the lawyer;  the consul
from the previous trial in the short skirt
(continuous) But  spent the last three and a half years of my life in your prison and  think  paid for my error and if it's your decision today to sentence me to more years,
(a break) You know my lawyers told me 'be cool Billy don't get upset, don't get angry, if you're good  can maybe get a pardon, an amnesty, an appeal, this that and the other thing
' Well that's been going down now for 35 years
looks over, surprised he is talking like this
Looks at

You hung 53 days in front of my eyes and then you took those 53 days away, and Mister Prosecutor
just wish you could
looks over, through his dark green glasses
() stand right here where 'm standing and feel what that
feels like, cause then you'd know something you don't know you'd know what means, Mister Prosecutor and you'd know the concept of a society is based on the quality of its mercy means, of its sense of fair play, its sense of justice
but (shrugs and scoffs at himself) guess that's just like asking a bear to shit in a toilet
stops, looks puzzled

Fuck it, give me the sentence
Jesus forgave the bastards, but  can't

They are annoyed

With him is  working on the same stone
They are sweating, shirtless, looking back over their shoulders at: guarding the

Painful work
' Dear Susan
It's taken me a long time to find out that it's got to stop somewhere

There is only one way out of here
The Midnight Express
kicks with his sneakers at the stone, as silently as possible
- crumbling dust, stucco
at the stairs freezes, fearful
Then
He Runs over

(in a whisper) We're undermining the other stones
studies it, pointing to the stone above left the one that has been loosened
We gotta take a chance and do that one next - (pointing) Then pull out this one - (pointing to the one directly left of the loosened stone, excited) Just jiggle it, scratch it out, loose nit up, it's soft real soft
has his head pressed close to the loosened stone
Suddenly: It's there
What
Listen

The faintest whisper of  and dripping ' - indicating a shaft of some nature

Fuck me
You beautiful mother, you
: now on guard at the , looks over at: - with fresh paste putting the finishing touches on the edges of the stone which has been replaced in its original position
Bell's half naked torso reveals a pair of dice with lucky sevens tattooed on his shoulder
: On close inspection, it is apparent that the stucco around it doesn't match the other stones one bit, but as we   to see  washing his tea cups in the  during the , this irregularity is lost in the greater mosaic of the wall structure
At least doesn't notice as: nervously comes into the  area, watching him, and calls to him
(using Turkish) Hey, Ziat, hurry up with the tea will ay
(mutters to himself) Work, work, work, that's all do don't hear you bitch about the money
followed by  into the  casts a look of relief at: and  who wait at a table with empty tea cups

Both covered with sweat, working with confidence now
on the other side
Dripping water
Two stones removed

You want to split your hernia again
Get off our tits
Bell turns to go
Suddenly a    and: starts to go - but brakes itself

All  of them look: Easily big enough for them to squeeze through

The same thought
Eager eyes

Shakes his head

How's your hernia
Don't make me laugh

Heads in that direction

What time is it
Two thirty
of walkways
The three stop exhausted, faces blackened

Shit
Shit

The Turks musta' sealed it up
What the fuck we gonna do
as the three pathetic escapees ponder their fate

We go back

You gotta be joking

There's gotta be a way
Those bats got out someplace

Doubletime
Takes the  and starts to follow it back

Urging him on
You gotta have a lot of balls for this , suffering, can't help but grin

overhearing it
Yeah, what if got caught
starts to giggle

laughing, shaking his head
(between giggles) Who's laughing
mean  find this terribly depressing
Can you see old Hamidou's face when he tries to figure this one out
can't go on, starts to giggle at the thought
(between giggles) We'll tell him we were checking out our escape route
We wanted to be completely sure before we tried it

We feel they will be spotted this time, but: : slumps into his  as the first rays of  come up in the sky and the  from the Mosque commences
He immediately sinks into sleep
on    being washed in the follows into view
is preparing his early morning tea, his good eye now moving to something beyond the tea leaves
Curious, he straightens, throwing the withered bunch of leaves the sink
approaches the irregular stucco paste around the ; runs his fingers along the ridges, noticing the paste is fresh
snoring from fatigue
wakes him quickly
Billy, wake up
They found it
there is a lot of  downstairs

He has a look of total despair on his face, as he watches

grinning, moves away, and his falaka stick cocked like a sergeant major - moves among the prisoners
Shut up
They all fall immediately silent
continues his walk among them, bypassing: who shifts his gaze onto: approaches, his eyes moving over with contempt, and shifting him aside with the stick
To him Billy is the same passive prisoner as before
He moves on, shifting  aside and then stops at: swings his stick up slowly and taps him lightly on the chest
realizes and is afraid
No do
No do
tell you  see you again
Finish
He punctuates this last with a theatrical tap on the chest and he gestures to the
Take him

No
Oh no
No

Bell's continue
unable to contain his anger, strides right up to , collars him, livid
You bastard

Good
Man to man
We fight now
And when finish  bring Hamidou and he kick you fuckinq ass
is about to swing when  grabs him
Max
Cool it
(looking at Ziat calmly) Ziat's just doing his job
Glances from  back to  fixing on him as walks him away
: is at his  that ; puts away the hypodermic needle, stoned and speeding at the same time, smoking a cigarette
inwardly tense, sits with his head in his hands
Bell's gonna talk
They got to find out
Man, we gotta out
Tears have formed in his eyes
Goddamn Gastro's killing me
Making me blind
Hey Billy
(sympathetic) Yeah
got some acid man
Maybe we can drop some on the guards huh
In their tea or something
looks away, not even considering
But  is caught up in the notion
Yeah  got it all worked out
Billy, listen to me

When he's Seeing rainbows yer know

Then we're outside the kogus

After we're outside the kogus
Oh we

Max
Your  shirt's on fire
clumsily brushes the burning ash off his shirt where it's made a hole
Oh shit
Oh Christ
His eyes cloud with tears
He sits down, head between his hands
There just comes a time you know
you know you're never going to git it on
Suddenly shifts mood again, stands, pulling out a , resolute, eyes brightening
That's what 'm gonna do
(giggles) looks up wondering
What
(crazily) Cut his fucking throat
Whose
What do  got to lose huh
What do  got to lose
And 'd really enjoy it
Lurches against the bunk
Max, sit down
You're in no shape to kill anybody
want to cut his throat
It's already been cut
Then 'll cut his balls off
smiles, shakes his head, then: If you really wanted to hurt Ziat (pause) slumps back down on the bunk, suddenly tired of killing
(reflective) His money - steal that, you steal his blood
Could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched
(plays with the thought idly, then shrugs) If we knew where he hid it
(waves it away) Anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways
We couldn't hide it anywhere
(head bobbing now, murmurs) You know where it is
What
(a vague grin) know where it is
glances at him, not sure whether he heard
His money
gives him a goofy nod - and a grin
Imitating Robert Newton as Long John Silver

In the process we see that not much attention is paid him because everybody else is crazy
There are 50 other  yelling at each other in fights over sheets, blankets, beds, cigarettes, jumping: screaming, pushing, shoving; some babbling to themselves, rocking, crying, chanting, singing
Several of them (the craziest) are stark naked
some, wrapped in torn blackened sheets, patrol the room like quick ferrets, sharp eyes open for anything they can steal
Others move in meaningless, blank-eyed silence
The walls are filthy black and join the ceilings in arches rather than angles, giving the look of an old dungeon

Glances at him, smiles
They won't let  go either
The smug certainty of his manner reaches some chord deep inside Billy, because Billy glances briefly at this lunatic who is smiling
Billy looks back at his feet
No, they'll never let you go
They tell you they let you go but you stay
You never go from here

They know one of the machines that doesn't work

Kabin on-yedi plods without interest to the specified cabin, closes the door, sits in the chair
No one is there
He waits - indifferent to any sense of time
Dirty two glass panes separate visitor and prisoner booths; bars are between the panes
An erratic microphone is the method of communication, giving a weird and distant aspect to the voice

stares at her, his face rabid, decaying; if he remembers her even, he doesn't register it because she is a shock to him as well
Reality, the outside world all at once
His mind is spinning, unbalanced, unable to grasp it

Billy, what have they done to you

She looks silently
No sobbing, no big sad looks
Just shock
Shock of recognition, shock of time gone by

fingers the photo album nervously, speaking slow and distinct; not sure she is communicating
Billy, your family is fine
Senator Buckley just made a special plea on your behalf in the Senate
Newsday has written several big articles about you
They've called you a pawn in the poppy game between Nixon and the Turks
The letters are coming in, Billy

It sounds all wrong in this context

He hasn't seen a woman for five years and now a hungry animal look comes into his eyes He moves suddenly pressing up against the glass, rabid

realizes he has come, surprised
looks at her
Furtive, animal shame
And suddenly he starts to cry
flood of feelings locked up too long come pouring out
He murmurs some words, Turkish sputtering out in his throat, then: Susan
Softly, working his mouth finding it hard to speak
yearning
Tears sprinkling her eyes
Yes, Billy
straining, not out of physical weakness but an emotional one
Sputters, eyes closed

He's over in Greece now
He bought a ticket

Possibly there is a gleam of understanding in his eyes but it is very faint
An Attendant  on Susan's door,

You were right Billy don't count on them, you hear, don't count on anybody but yourself

Let's go
Susan stands, about to go, then suddenly leans up close to the bars, hard and practical

Get to Greece, you hear me

It is early morning and the walkers haven't started yet
Billy looks at the Pillar a dire look of reflection passing over his eyes
Then he starts walking but in a clockwise motion, opposite the normal pattern; in the same methodical manner as before

They glare at him, motion for him to turn around
Billy just keeps walking

curious about his unusual behavior, follows
Why you go
Why don't you walk the wheel with us

You still don't believe it
You still don't believe you're a bad machine

The factory knows
That's why they put you here
You'll see
You'll find out
Later on you'll know

His eyes glint with special knowledge and he takes  into his confidence using the latter's tone of voice: already know

This man is dredging Billy through a sadistic imagination sparked by the steam, the sweat, and an ethnic identification with a Turkish steam bath as a bedroom
He loosens his hold abruptly, rises, moves off as: holds himself on his knees, head sunk on his chest, gasping for breath, about to vomit
Pause; he looks up horrified at: pouring fresh buckets of water on the floor
