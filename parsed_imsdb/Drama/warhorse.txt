The bucolic magnificence of the Devon countryside
We fly low over the high, thick hedges untouched for hundreds of years
The thick verdant countryside in all its splendor, ancient woodlands, fields of corn, and finally a paddock in a typical Devonshire dale
We come to rest beside three farmers standing over a pregnant mare
The mare is in distress - she is about to give birth
The farmers calm the mare and tend to her gently with assurance and authority
We pull back to see, , a fifteen-year-old farm boy, watching the whole drama with delight from the paddock gate
Come on, easy, girl
Easy, girl
Easy
The men hold the mare firmly, but clearly this is a difficult birth
2 This is a stubborn one, huh
3 There we go
Who's a clever girl
Moments later - the summer's sun glints off the wet, sticky hide of the foal () - red hide, four white socks and a distinctive white cross on its forehead
Soon the creature is attempting its first clumsy steps
It is both awesome and comical to see the new born creature struggle to his feet, but eventually, he succeeds
Title: /,
We follow Joey's progress over the course of his first year
His initial fearfulness, his connection with his mother, the intimacy of their relationship
As Joey gets strong they run together, frolicking gayly in the last dregs of summer
Albert looking on
Joey notices him at the fence and they share a moment of connection
Spring: flowers are beginning to sprout by the hedgerows
Our boy Albert runs into the field
He takes an apple from his pocket - he holds it out tentatively
Joey approaches Albert with suspicion
Albert gently encourages him
2
His mother paws the ground and neighs at Joey
He turns and runs over the field at her beck and call
Albert tosses the apple to himself, ruefully - watches in awe as Joey races away with his mother
He is a magnificent one year old
His distinctive red coat gleaming, now it is clear that he is half thoroughbred
He runs quickly around the field enjoying his own power and strength
Later - the three farmers open the gate and come into the field
Both Joey and his mother instinctively canter over to the two men, expecting food
The three men gently greet the horses and pet them, then we see one man has a noose made of a rope
He slips it round Mum's neck
She pulls back, Joey is shaken and bewildered but before he knows what's happening the second farmer is trying to get a similar rope around his neck
Joey balks and pushes the farmer aside, distressed to see his mother tethered
The farmer grabs Joey again and struggles with him, enlisting the help of the second farmer
With some effort they get the rope around his neck and calm him down
2 Easy does it
Easy does it
Come on, steady does it
Unused to being tethered Joey pulls at the rope but the farmers are solid and firm
They gently lead Joey and his mother across the field to the gate and out into the road
The whole road becomes overtaken by a flock of sheep on their way to the market
In the distance we hear the bustle of Market Day
The farmers lead Joey and his mother through the chaos of the market and into an auction pen
They find themselves amongst a hoard of pigs, sheep and cows
Joey is agog at all of these creatures and all this life he had no idea existed
The farmers lead the horses into a stall to await the auction
Joey is bewildered by all the noise - buttressed against a couple of mules and a cow
He is uncomfortable in this tight space
An   holds a clipboard out for the lead farmer
1 Mornin', pop
Put your mark here
Good luck
3
'
Two men approach the pen
2 Get the colt
One man grabs Joey and pulls him out of the pen
Suddenly there is a look of horror on his face
His terrified mother realises they are being separated
Joey panics and desperately tries to get back to his mother, he rises up throwing the man who is leading him aside
Joey is out of control
The man regains control of Joey
3 Whoa
Whoa
He pulls Joey away from his mother, who lets out a heart- rending cry, paws the ground, and crashes her foreleg against the fence
Joey remains disoriented in the midst of the market day chaos
3 (') Easy
The auction ring is full of people of all shapes and sizes
There is a sense of celebration and busyness about market day
We concentrate on two men - Ted Narracott (), in his forties, clearly both the cares of the world and alcohol have worn him down before his time, and  , his more solid friend, both working farmers
Just behind Si is his 15 year old son,
Ted has a drink in his hand
They all look at Joey bridling against the men who are trying to hold him
Now that's a beauty
Forget it, Ted
He's half thoroughbred and not got a day's work in him
(points to a plow horse next to ) Now, there
There's your ticket
In contrast to Joey, the solid and bulky plow horse stands like a rock
But Dad remains fixated on Joey
But look at him, Si
Look at that creature
4
Indeed, Joey is magnificent, his power clearly emerging because of his upset
Don't be daft
You need something solid to plow a field
(fixed on Joey) Yeah, but he's something else, that one
The  announces the start of the auction
Alright gentlemen - settle down - settle down - horses on my right - men with money in their pockets on my left - it's the perfect combination
Is Fred Goddard here
shouts his reply from the crowd
's here
Good - more money than sense
Dave Hill
'm here
Yes
Bugger off, you tight bastard - you've been coming here for 20 years - never bought so much as a pork scratching
The crowd are loving all this
Dad notices a figure across the ring, , clearly a man of money
You can see something light up in Dad's eyes - a combination of dislike and alcohol
Joey is led into the auction pen
(') Okay - first up today - a gorgeous young horse - prettiest thing 've seen since my wife on our wedding day
Let's get going, shall we
Who wants this wonderful creature
But no-one bids
One guinea
5
One guinea, one guinea, one guinea
thought you needed a plow horse, Mister Narracott
Any advance on one guinea
Any advance on one guinea
Joey is still trying to get back to his mother
voice from the crowd pipes up: Two guineas
Three
Ted Narracott - it's completely the wrong animal
Lyons whispers to his son, , 15, next to him
David eyes Joey skeptically
Si Easton - 'm not gonna let that bastard see me off
Five guineas
Six
Oh for the love of
Joey is straining to get to his mother, the men are pulling him back
Seven
Greedy sod thinks he can just buy anybody
() Eight
6
Stop it - he's your landlord - you can't be picking fights with him
Lyons looks over
There is now tension in the crowd as they sense a Battle Royal for the horse
Ten guineas
He smirks at Dad
You haven't got the money
Let's go home - let's have a pint
Eleven guineas, sir, from as good a man as any in this town
They all look at Lyons in his suit and bowler hat
Do  hear twelve guineas
Twelve guineas
That's top price for a workin' animal
Ted
Save it for the shire
There are big days and there are small days
Which will it be
Do  hear any advance on eleven guineas
All eyes are on Lyons and his son - David is 15, smartly dressed
Just let him go, dad,  don't care for him, he's too
jumpy
Lyons isn't listening to David; he's looking hard at Ted
Shall we say - twenty five
The crowd gasps
This is clearly personal
Well, he's got you there
Nice try, Ted
7
You were great, Mr
Gave him a run for his money
But when he looks at Ted, Ted's eyes are locked into the eyes of his rival
Going, going
Thirty
Thirty guineas
Total silence
He stares hard at Lyons
Who simply smiles, raises an eyebrow, tips his hat and walks away
It dawns on Dad that he's won the auction
He breaks into a sweat
Thirty guineas
Thirty guineas
Going going gone - to Mister Ted Narracott
He bangs his gavel
It's a done deal
What have you done, Ted
What have you done
Dad doesn't acknowledge Si
Moments later - Ted stands staring at Joey, who looks back
Ted holds his reins numbly, accepts his receipt from the auction man in a kind of daze
Suddenly, Lyons appears at Dad's shoulder
Quite a beast, there
But what you gonna do with him - on a working farm
hope you got the rent, Ted
'll be around for it when it comes due
Dad does not acknowledge Lyons
Lyons smiles and walks away with son David, and his cronies
Si shakes his head at Dad
You're a fool, Ted
And our Rosie'll never forgive you
'
kneels in her garden, digging up some carrots, when she sees Ted returning
Dad walks down the hedged lane as the sun sets pulling Joey with him, his bad leg always moving slightly to the side
8
Mrs
Narracott looks in horror and bewilderment at Joey and then at Dad
She is a good-looking, intelligent woman, but clearly her life is always hard
What have you done
Dad stands shamefaced as Albert - the boy we have already met - runs out of the house to join them
That's Mooney's colt
You were supposed to buy a plow horse
You bought him
What'd you pay for him
Albert is totally taken by the horse
(') How much, Ted Narracott
won't tell you a lie - though  would love to
Thirty guineas
Thirty guineas
She is stunned
She looks at Ted - and he just nods
(') He's not worth ten
Are you out of your mind
What about the rent
He's a strong one, Rosie
Look at the way he holds his head
How the hell are we gonna pull anything with that
Ted - you have to take him back
You have to take him back right now now
No
9
You have to get down on your knees and beg for our money back
Joey bridles at the raised voices but Albert takes the rope and tries to calm him
No
No, please don't take him back
Suddenly we see Dad's dejection
He is a man lost
We can't take him back till he's broken in
And how are you gonna train a horse with that leg
'll train him
No, you stay out of this, Albie
You don't know nothing about horses
Please, Mum
Please let me
can do it
We have to keep him
We've no choice
Right
Well
you've got one month to break him in or 'm taking him back myself
(She turns to the house, but then
) How did you get to thirty - what other fool bid you up that high
It was Lyons
Mrs
Narracott turns back towards the house, then stops, dazed, speaking almost to herself
We're gonna lose everything
After all we've been through - we're gonna lose it all
She turns back to the others - the weight of the mistake heavy on their shoulders - but Albert quickly steps forward
10
Don't worry, Mum - 'll raise him - and 'll raise him good
Well, you better
Go on - get started
See if a child can undo what your fool of a father's done to this family of ours
Mrs
Narracott storms into the house
Albert immediately goes to stroke Joey but the nervous horse draws back uncomfortably
Dad leads him off, drunk and bewildered, across the yard to the barn
Albert loads some oats into a bucket and approaches Joey in the field
Right
Let's make a start then
As Albert approaches, Joey nervously runs in circles, then stops on a dime, looking at Albert suspiciously
(') It's oats
Very tasty, that is
It's beef and gravy to us
Albert squats down
He shows the food
Joey catches the scent on the air, but still hesitates and shies away
(') Come on
This time, Albert takes a new tact, almost turning his body fully away from Joey, but keeping the bucket extended
Albert slowly backs towards Joey, speaking gently all the while
(') bet you're missing your mother
Look at you
first time without your mum
First time away from home
But you're not alone, are you
In fact
Cos 'm `ere
Feeling safer, Joey moves toward the bucket of oats and starts to eat
(') It's alright
It's alright
11
Albert reaches out his hand and touches Joey
And with a slight start, the horse relaxes into Albert's hand, feeling safe with the boy
Albert stares at the distinctive white cross on Joey's forehead
Joey calms
(') 'm gonna call you Joey
Understand
Joey
That's you
And 'm Albert
It's alright, You're mine now
You're mine
Albert strokes Joey's forehead
Joey lifts his head and the two stare at each other in close proximity
Dad, with a hangover, hobbles off to work the fields
As he reaches the gate,  the goose snaps at his heels
Dad dismisses him with a stare and heads for the stables
,
The training episode: Albert walks Joey around the yard on the rope
It all seems to be going well
Mum looks on
Albert is clearly proud of his progress
Albert's friend, Andrew Easton, sits on a rock with an apple in hand to watch the training
Albert sets Joey in a spot and tells him to wait
Whoa
want you to stay there, Joey
Stay
That's it
Good boy
That's it, you've got it
Of course when Albert walks away, Joey follows
game of "Grandma's footsteps" ensues as Albert patiently places Joey then walks away
Hey, look at him, Albie
He's playing "Grandma's Footsteps
" Albert patiently leads Joey back to his starting position
Right, come on, Joey
Back you go
Come on
Back you go
() 12
(') You're all right
That's it
Good boy
Right
You've gotta stay there, understand
Albert walks away again
(') That's it
Good boy
You've got it
Good boy
Finally Joey stays put
Andrew smiles, impressed
Good boy
Good
( ) Now call him
Whistle
Come now, Joey
Come on
Albert whistles like an owl
Joey stands completely still
(') You can come now, Joey
He whistles again
Joey remains still
Don't think he fancies your owls
Albert walks back to Joey, frustrated
No,  read it in a story
It's how the Indians used to summon their horses
He gently strokes Joey's nose
(') Now, Joey, when  whistle, you've gotta come, understand
My dad had a dog who stayed when you called him
He used to run up behind you when you weren't looking, and uh
He's not a dog
He's just puzzling it through
13
Albert runs further away than before and whistles
After a moment, Joey trots over to him
Andrew smiles broadly
Brilliant
Look at you
With the basis established, Albert begins to train Joey to react to the owl whistle without his prompting
It's not all easy going - sometimes Albert makes progress, sometimes not
- Mrs
Narracott fills a bucket at the pump, then promptly spills it when Joey trots past her in response to an owl whistle
She calls off, frustrated
Albie
Dad heads out to the fields with a rake on his shoulder
There's an owl call and Joey trots past him in the background
Dad sees Albert welcome Joey by the haystacks, stroking his nose affectionately
Dad walks on, his expression inscrutable
Joey trots up a path, pursuing another owl call
After several more calls, he still can't spot Albert, until he cranes his neck up and sees Albert sitting in a nearby tree
Albert laughs
Lyons is there with his son, David, and his unlikable cronies
He holds a meager handful of cash
Dad and Mum look chastened
The mood is sombre
There's only fifteen here
The rest will come
You know by rights  could take this farm back today, don't you
And 'm a great believer in my rights
It will come
If you drank less beer and bought fewer horses you might be able to look your landlord in the eye, Narracott
Lyons begins loading up his ledger into his bag
14
said 'll pay you
We got to plant the bottom field
Bottom field's rock hard
Only stones down there
No, we're going to plow it
Just give me `til the autumn
'll pay every penny  owe you
With interest
How you going to plow it
Not with that fancy animal of yours
He'll do it
You'll not get that one in a harness, let alone pulling a plow
Even drunk on a Tuesday night, you know that
And  can't wait for the money - there's a war coming
Dad stands up from his chair, resolute
promise you that field will be plowed
We'll plant it with turnips
And the money will be yours when harvest comes
Mrs
Narracott interjects, desperate
Please, sir
Please
Lyons takes his time
He looks at them both - Ted and Rosie, almost beaten
Very well - if that fancy plows that field 'll give you till October to set things straight
Lyons heads for the door, but Albert stands in his way
What if he doesn't
'll take the horse on the day he fails
() () 15
(') And 'll take your father's farm and give it to working men who can hold their pints and hold their heads high in decent company
Lyons tries to move past, but Albert grabs his arm
No, please
Sir, you can't do that
Now, now, now, lad
What - are you bladdered as well
Ted Narracott -  got you down in my book
Albert knows he has to back down
Lyons walks past him and leaves with David and his cronies
Harold the goose attacks Lyons and his men
They quickly pile into his car and drive off
Ted stands in the kitchen immobile with upset
Dad throws open the stable door, jerks the harness from the wall, throws open Joey's stall and starts to lunge at the horse
Albert runs in to try to stop him
You can't harness him
He's got to be collared
Dad starts to grapple with Joey desperately flailing in an attempt to get the harness onto Joey
Joey is completely confused and frightened
No, you can't
Look, you're scaring him, Dad
You're scaring him
He
() He can't take a plow
Joey tries to push Dad out of the way, Dad frustrated by this hits Joey hard with the harness
He's got to plow
16
He won't be able to do it - he's too young - he's not even been backed yet
Joey rears up and kicks Dad
Who falls to the ground
Ted
Albert grabs Joey's bridle
Joey wrestles with Albert
It's alright, boy
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
Dad is mad with anger and frustration - and in pain
He staggers to his feet and leaves
Albert calms Joey down
Mrs
Narracott returns the harness to its hook
knew this would happen soon as  laid eyes on him
But then she notices Dad has returned
He has a gun
(') Ted
No
Ted, no
He's worth nothing to me
If he won't take the collar, he's not worth a damn thing
Dad
He grabs the rifle, but Dad shoves him away
Move aside
Dad raises the rifle, but Albert wrestles for it again
Dad
Stop
Furious with frustration Dad throws Albert to the ground and takes aim at the horse
Mrs
Narracott quickly pulls the gun aside
You shoot that horse we have nothing
17
Dad whips the gun back towards Joey to find Albert standing between them - right in front of the gun's barrel
For a second we think Albert will be inadvertently shot
(') Dad pauses his finger just in time
Albert gently holds the barrel of the gun
Speaks calmly
You were right what you said, Dad
"He'll do it," you told Lyons, "He'll plow that field
" And he will
You'll see
He'll show you
We'll show you
We'll get it done
Dad looks at him, frozen
Mrs
Narracott eases the gun away from him - Let go
Let go
- and hands it to Albert, telling him - (') Go back to the house
As Albert leaves, Ted takes out his flask
But Rosie takes it from him gently
He doesn't resist
Here, here
Some days are best forgotten
Today ain't one of them
Come on
They exit the stable together, leaving Joey in his stall
/
Albert walks towards the stables - enters
And talks to Joey as he prepares the harness
How are you today, Joey
don't know much about life, boy, but  do know that there are big days and there are small days
And most days are small days, and, well, they don't matter much to anyone - but this - well, this is a big one
This is our big day
Well, it's cold out there
So 'm going to take this off - (he takes off his coat) Well, if it's tough for you - it should be tough for me, too
18
He is left in just a loose-fitting white shirt
(') Now, 'm gonna teach you how to plow and you're gonna learn
Is that understood
And then we can be together, which is how  believe things are meant to be
Joey instinctively balks, but Albert is stern with him
(') Boy
Steady, boy
Here we go
Here we go
As he approaches Joey with the harness, Harold the goose enters the stable to watch
Albert approaches gently and slowly puts the harness over his own neck and shoulders to demonstrate - (') Easy, easy
Look at me, Joey
See
See
You've just gotta put your nose through
It is a moment between them
The horse looks Albert in the eye, then yields
Albert comforts him and show there is nothing to fear
Finally he gets the harness in place
(') That's it
See
You've got it
You've got it
Good boy
There
Harold honks his approval
Albert leads Joey out across the yard, through the broken gate
It is a grey day as they walk across the plowed fields towards the huge lower field
They come to a rusty, primitive plow left in the grass
Albert looks around the field - it is overgrown, it seems to go on forever - even if Joey was a plow horse this would be a heavy task
Si Easton and Andrew stroll up the road to watch
Too large, too rocky, matted with grass roots
Even a sturdy plow horse'd never manage it alone
19
Yet he will,  say
You'd swear he'd sprout wings and fly if Albert had told you so
(smiling at his son:) It's a fine thing, loyal to your mate
Even if he is a bit barmy team of two might manage, given a month and good weather
They're interrupted by the honk of a horn as Lyons and David pull up in a car
Lyons and David get out
Their driver remains inside
Ted too squeamish to watch, is he
`Course he's watching
Si nods in the direction of the house
Albert steadies Joey and starts to tie on the heavy plow
It just seems too big and bulky for Joey's sleek frame
Albert sets Joey right and fixes the plow
Lyons, David, Si, and Andrew walk towards Dad, who looks on anxiously from a nearby hedgerow
Lyons gestures at David to stay back and walks over to Ted alone
He stands beside him and begins to talk gently
Well, you've raised him up a true Narracott, Ted, picture of his father, he is: not a dollop of ordinary sense but that thick stubbornness that'll lead him to insist on the impossible
Down in the field, Albert continues to prep the plow
(') Wasn't a farmer in Devon didn't admire you, myself among `em, leaving your brothers that fine farm and setting yourself at this stoney patch of unpromising ground
You've fettle enough for twenty men, but with a gimpy leg and the drinking - for the pain, isn't it, that you drink
() 20
(') - yeah, none of us could have anticipated an ending better than this
Makes me question the wisdom of the charity that urged me to rent you this place, not only looking at you, me old pal, but that pretty little wife of yours, thought you were a spark, she did
Ted hasn't acknowledged Lyons for a second; he's never taken his eyes off Albert
He simply stands and walks away as : (') And now your son's sinking into the selfsame bog that's swallowing you
Albert has been meticulously preparing everything, positioning Joey, checking the tethers, digging the rusty plow in the earth
He takes his position behind the plow, throwing the rear leather harness over his own neck
See Joey -  got the collar, too
Albert gently snaps the reins
Joey doesn't move, confused by the whole affair
(') Come on, boy
Walk on
That's it
Walk on
Walk on, Joey
Come on, boy, walk on
You'd be better off startin' at the top of the hill and goin' down
Gravity's the only friend you're gonna have today, young lad
Walk on, Joey
Walk on
Come on, Joey, walk on
Walk on, boy
At the house, Mrs
Narracott opens an upstairs window to look on, anxiously
Ted, standing alone by the fence, only looks at Albert
(') Walk on
Come on, walk on
( :) It'll take the whip to move him
21
Just as Ted is saying this, Albert, as if hearing his father, takes a breath and then abruptly produces a whip
Joey's ears prick up
Albert, grimly determined, snaps the whip at Joey
Joey panics and bolts
The plow spins to its side, pulls Albert off his feet
Joey drags them all the way to the top of the hill, right by the farmhouse
Lyons, yelling, starts laughing and can't stop
Bravo
You've reached the top of the hill
Off you go again, boy
You'll make even better time comin' down
He continues past Dad, laughing
- Mrs
Narracott looks on from the house
He glances back at her
Her face is full of angry concern for their son
Townsfolk begin arriving, climbing the hill to the lower field
Ted looks down, ashamed
Mrs
Narracott looks back at Albert, mortified, bruised, setting the plow right again
Mrs
Narracott moves away from the window, takes a seat, and picks up her knitting
Later - Albert has made no progress
Joey is moving, but only in a useless circle
Good boy
Good lad
Good lad
Now walk on
Good boy
More townsfolk clamor to the fence
Andrew calls out
Albie, we're all with ya
Albert tries to encourage him forward but Joey still isn't pulling sufficiently
The plow skips uselessly over the surface stones
Look look look
The plow hasn't even cut yet
As Albert struggles with the plow, he sees Dad walking up the hill behind the spectators
He doesn't even turn to his son
22
Joey strains as Albert pushes with all his might
We sense the strain on the horse and the inappropriateness of the task
But Joey perseveres
The plow limps along
Do you know -  believe we can do it, Joey
knew when  first saw you that you'd be the best of us
That's why he bought you
He knows you've all the courage he never had
knew when  first saw you that you'd be the one who'd save us
The plow skips and Albert falls
Joey's legs buckle and he goes to his knees
Albert rushes to his side
(') Whoa
Whoa
Lyons calls from the crowd as rain starts to fall
You've got no chance, lad
He'll not turn over half an acre
Give it up now
You've done well
You've tried hard
You're more of a man than your father
Albert examines the collar - he sees it is ripping into Joey's flesh
He grabs his shirt, tears a piece off it, tenderly folds it and puts it between Joey's shoulder and the collar
Come on now, Mr
Lyons, that's a bit rough, isn't it
( :) Well, he'll destroy that horse
The crowd's beginning to disperse
One of Lyons' cronies holds his umbrella as he returns to his car
He passes Ted
(') 'll be over Thursday
Give you a day to close it up
Mrs
Narracott emerges from the house and heads to the fence - holding her knitting in the rain, ignoring the leaving crowds
hands her: 23
Your wool
() 'm sorry, Rosie
Lyons passes behind her, almost speaks, but then thinks better of it
As the rain intensifies, Albert digs his toe into the wet soil and notices how it has softened
Suddenly something flashes through Albert's mind
He leaps into action, runs through the rain to shout at Joey
Now, boy
You've got to do it, Joey
You don't know, so 'm gonna have to do the knowing for you when the rest of our lives depend on this
So get set to pull - and pull straight
And pull hard
He races back to the plow and sets himself
(') Now, boy
Go
Joey pulls firmly and finally the inertia is broken - the rain has softened the earth
(') Walk on, Joey
Walk on
That's it
Good boy, Joey
Good boy
Finally, the plow bites deep into the soil
Walk on
Walk on
Walk on
Walk on, Joey
At the fence, Mrs
Narracott looks on in amazement
Albert notices a large rock in their path
Andrew sees it, too
(') () Go around it
Whoa, Joey
Whoa, Joey
Joey
Joey, whoa whoa whoa
Joey, stop
You'll break the blade - 24
Albert hauls back on the reins, but Joey throws his flanks forward, straining and lurching until the plow blade splits the rock completely in half and now the plow moves more easily through the wet ground
The ground yields
Soon Albert and Joey are making great progress
The wet earth slipping open beneath them
Andrew is loving it, speaks in wonder
Will you look at you
Mrs
Narracott looks very happy, a smile breaking slowly across her face
The crowd begins to return
Lyons notices and looks out from his car - sees the plow digging through the field
Annoyed at the progress Albert's making, he gets out of his car and walks over to Mrs
Narracott
With great disdain he : 'd not let a child of mine slip in the mud alongside a plow blade
He could lose a foot
Mrs
Narracott brandishes her knitting needles, backing him up
You'll likelier lose an eye, Mr
Lyons, if you carry on prating at me how to manage my son
Or my plow, or my horse, or my field, or my farm
Dad sits nearby, watching this exchange with silent approval
Lyons stares at her, gape-mouthed, as she turns her attention back to Albert
Come on, Albie
Push on through
The rain becomes torrential
Lyons turns towards the car - gestures, frustrated, to his driver, who runs forward with the umbrella to shield his boss from the rain
David remains on the running board, watching Albert plowing
The plow speeds through the earth
The boy and the horse are working as one
It is a moment of triumph
Get it done, Albie
Get it done
25
We pull back to see they have made only the smallest dent in the enormous field
As Lyons' car passes, Dad steps forward, takes in the scene, and almost smiles
The rain has abated
Albert, soaked to the skin, sits next to Joey
They are both covered in mud
Andrew, followed by Si Easton, charges through the gate up to Albert
They are lifting Albert up between them, laughing, Si Easton planting a kiss on Albert's muddy cheek, Andrew tousling his filthy hair, when Mrs
Narracott arrives with Ted
She helps Si and Andrew lift Albert and slings her son's arm over her shoulder, glowing with pride, crying, overjoyed
Oh, my pair of fools
My mighty fools
As the others help Albert up, Ted tends to Joey
He looks over to his son and, after a moment, removes his cap and slightly bows his head
The others stagger away, supporting Albert, and Ted pats the horse and gently begins to unbuckle the harness
Albert washes Joey and tends the wounds and sores on his body
Rosie is putting antiseptic on Albert's wrists and shoulders
Joey bristles but is soothed by Albert's care
You're as battered and bloodied as he is
And where's Dad
Still in the bottom field
Stumbling about,  suppose
It's not the drink, Albert, that makes him stumble - 26
() He drinks, mum
Well, so might you if you'd been where he's been, seen what he's seen
Well, he don't talk to me about it
He don't talk about it because he can't
There aren't words for some things
Come here
Rosie stalks over to a pile of broken equipment in a corner of the stables
She rummages until she finds a waterstained brown paper parcel tied with yarn
She brushes away some mouse turds
(') The mice've been at it
Sit down
They sit together on a step
As she begins to untie the yarn, a change comes over her: her irritated determination gives way to sadness
Albert comes to her and kneels beside her as she gently opens the paper
Inside there's a red and tan pennant, knotted and fringed at both ends
Here
It's his campaign pennant
He were Sergeant, Seventh Battalion, Imperial Yeomanry
Then with great care she unfolds the sash to reveal two silver medals
The first, with the profile of Victoria, hangs from a red, blue and orange ribbon
And that is the Queen's South Africa Medal
Every man who fought in the Boer War got one of those
But this
She holds up the other medal, hanging from a red and black ribbon
(') That's the Distinguished Conduct Medal
27
She hands Albert the Distinguished Conduct Medal
He takes it, astonished
Not dad's
Well it ain't mine, dear
He got that after the fighting at Transvaal
After he'd been hurt, and he'd saved some other lads, and well
don't know what else, he won't tell me either
But the first day he got home he just
tossed them out
First day he could walk, he threw `em straight in the dustbin, and wouldn't hear a word said not to
Albert nods, looking at the medal and campaign pennant
She takes the medal back, puts it in the sash, and begins to wrap it again
(') See, what you done today, you and Joey, you're chuffed up now, and so you should be, my splendid boy
It's good to be proud when you done something good
But what he done, in Africa, whatever it was, he takes no pride in it
Hard as it surely was, and however much pain it's cost him, he refuses to be proud of killing, suppose
She returns the things in the footlocker, closes it
(:) 'd be proud
If 'd gone off to war
If 'd gone and saved my mates, and - Well, whether or not you think you'd do the same thing as him
Think how brave he is for refusing to be proud
She heads back to Albert, pennant in hand
28
(') Oh, your dad makes mistakes
And he drinks to forget the mistakes that he's made - but he never gave up and he does that for us
And today, you showed the world it's all been worth it
As she leaves, she drapes the pennant over Albert's shoulder
(') You keep looking after Joey and he'll always be looking after you
Albert looks again at the pennant
(:) Sergeant, Seventh Battalion, Imperial Yeomanry
(amazed, to Joey:) You see this, Joey
It's been through an entire war
Albert holds the pennant in wonder
(') 'm not stealing it
'll give it back to him, someday
Early morning
Dad hobbling across the furrows, alone, planting the field by hand
Albert and Joey are now in a meadow
They trot past the field he plowed, now packed with a strong and sturdy crop, which Ted tends to
The sun is breaking through and Joey starts to run across the field and up a small incline
As both Joey and Albert gain confidence they pick up speed
Albert pushes Joey on, they are going faster and faster, Albert yells with the exhilaration of it all
Joey races flat out across the countryside
Albert hanging on for dear life
Albert and Joey pull up beside a sleek red car
It's Lyons' car, being driven by David Lyons, every inch the expensively- tailored rural gentry
29
Um, 'm the only boy that drives in the village
No one else drives but me
Oh, yeah
That's right and this is my dad's car
You're lucky that you're in it
'm not normally allowed to drive it `cause it's so - Albert urges Joey to go faster, till they're neck and neck beside the car, racing it
David Lyons looks to see Albert and Joey running alongside his car
He feigns disinterest
Albert glances at David, but he's much more interested in the very pretty young woman seated next to David, her hands trying to control her hair, flying in the wind
Forgetting himself momentarily, Albert stares at her, dazzled
The woman turns to David: Is he a friend of yours
She smiles at Albert, encouraging him
David Lyons, annoyed, pushes the accelerator down, and the car edges ahead of Joey
But not for long
The sound of the acceleration and Albert's eagerness to impress the young woman make Joey go faster, and again he moves out ahead of the car
The young woman grins at Albert
Up ahead Albert sees that the wall alongside of which he's been racing turns the corner, presenting him and Joey with an obstacle
Albert encourages Joey to go faster
Come on, boy, let's show her how to fly
They head right for the wall, but at the very last moment, Joey balks and comes to a dead standstill, sending Albert sailing over the wall
Back in the car, the girl gasps and covers her mouth, concerned
David says nothing, but allows himself a small smile
On the other side of the wall, Albert stands a bit battered, but unfazed
30
(') Well
you're clearly not gonna be a jumper
Thunder starts to rumble ominously in the background
Albert and Joey return, driving sheep before them
Angry storm clouds stretch to the horizon
As Albert leads Joey to the stable, lighting blasts across an angry sky
The rain is falling in torrents
Another crack of thunder - and a piece of wood in the roof gives way - water gushes in - Dad rushes to support the roof as the wind forces a window open
At that moment, the door suddenly swings open with the violence of the storm, smashing against the wall - Dad and Rosie turn - and there is Harold the goose, who scuttles in without his usual arrogance and hides himself in a corner
Shoo, Harold
Shoo, shoo, shoo
The thunder cracks again and
Albert and Dad walk across the field
Mrs
Narracott digs through the mess
The entire crop is flat - ruined by the storms
The ground squelches beneath their feet
The whole field is a write off
We can try planting something else, or we could hire ourselves out to Uncle Bob
Dad doesn't answer
He shakes his head and limps away
(') How else we gonna pay Mr
Lyons' rent
Ted doesn't turn around
31
Mrs
Narracott makes some coffee
Ted sits alone on a chair
What we gonna do
used to believe that God gave each man his fair portion of bad luck
don't feel that any more
've had more than my share
() You'll stop loving me, Rose
And  won't blame you when you do
Well,  might hate you more - but 'll never love you less
Then somewhere in the distance, an unfamiliar sound
motorbike rumbles along the lane at huge speed creating a cloud of dust as it goes
The noise of the motorbike is drawing attention from all over the valley
It can be heard fields away and everyone is drawn to this completely unheard of sound
The motorbike whizzes through the village
Heads turn in astonishment
It's war
The bike comes to a stop in the market place
The rider takes off his goggles
Men of the village start to flock around the machine, with great curiosity
(') We are at War with Germany
You hear
England is at war with Germany
Shock and amazement
The rider takes off his goggles: (') They're going to ring the bells at six o'clock - and then never ring them again until the war is over
32
Everyone across England knows that their lives are about to change
Dawn rises over the farm
Albert races to the stables, excited with the campaign pennant
As Albert enters the stables, he calls out: Look smart, Joey lad, it's the Tavistock Fair
Albert opens the doors and stops dead
He looks at the empty stables
/
/
Albert runs out
He rushes into the kitchen
His mother stares out the window
She has been crying
What has he done with him
She says nothing, but her face gives everything away
Albert in a panic turns and runs out into the lane
Mrs
Narracott tears up again
The market square is full of military men
The Union Jack is flying up the flagpole
group of girls has gathered to check out the army boys
Eager young men crowd a table staffed by recruiting officers: Last name first
First name, middle name, last
is in the square inspecting Joey, knowledgably
He is a handsome, attractive, modest, upper class man
Dad stands beside him
He checks Joey's teeth, his feet and finally, looks him straight in the eye
33
Take my word for it - finest horse in the parish
Goes like a racer, strong, decent, very fine
Captain Nicholls has immediately connected with Joey and puts him at his ease
, a tough sergeant, is physically inspecting Joey
No curbs, no splints, good feet and teeth
He's as sound as a bell, sir
And how much are you charging, sir - for this strong, decent, and very fine animal
Forty
'll give you twenty and not a penny more
Twenty is no good to me, Captain
Thirty five and he's yours
don't even know how he rides
Oh, he rides
Splendidly
You'll be astonished
promise you that
(his heart's in his throat, fighting back ) Finest horse in all of Devon
Finest horse  ever seen
Albert bursts into the square just in time to see Nicholls and Dad shake hands
Their business concluded
Thank you
Albert races towards Joey
Ted grabs him
Albert fights to get free
He looks at his father in anger and betrayal
You can't
You can't, he's mine
trained him
34
Albert
Albert is hysterical
You can't have him
He's my horse, sir
'm afraid it's too late, lad
've just paid thirty guineas for him
( :) Please, 'll get you money
will, 'll get you money
'll
'll work for it
'll work for it
( :) He won't obey anyone else
He won't be any good in the war, neither
He
he shies at every sound
'm sorry
Albert snaps to attention
Well, if Joey's going, 'm going, too
'm volunteering
see
What's your name, lad
Albert, sir
And how old are you, Albert
Nineteen, sir
Is that the truth
No sir
But, but  look nineteen and 'm bigger than most nineteen-year- olds, sir
And 'm strong, sir
And 'm not afraid of anything
: 35
don't doubt your qualifications, Albert, but the law is very clear about the proper age for soldiering, and your father's done what he had to do
You know that
Thirty guineas isn't nearly enough to purchase a horse as fine as your Joey,  know that
But it's all 've got
Will you lease him to me, Albert, to be my own mount
(he removes his cap, ) promise you, man to man, that 'll look after him as closely as you've done, 'll respect him and all the care that you've taken with him
And if  can - 'll return him to your care
Albert looks at him
Although Nicholls speaks with authority he has a kindness which Albert recognizes
(') Now say goodbye
Albert kisses Joey
It's all right, boy
But at that moment, Sam Perkins pulls Joey away: All right, turn it in, eh
That's enough
He's a horse, not a dog
Now, on your way
( ) Come on
Nicholls walks away into the crowd
The Sergeant pulls Joey, but Joey does not want to be separated from Albert
His reaction is implacable, reminiscent to the separation from his mother
Perkins leads Joey away
They disappear into the crowd and Rosie is suddenly there
Ted senses her silent judgment
Do you want to lose the farm, Rose
It's the way you did it
But we're at war
36
Aren't we just
She looks at Albert
Implacable
Forever
The recruits march through town under pennants and the strains of a familiar song("The Jolly Plowboy") - it is a song they all know, which means a lot to them - full of soul - a song of harvest or a Celtic hymn, something relating specifically to the lives they have led together
Everyone of every age - everyone in the village knows this song - it is theirs
Nicholls passes in his car and we see those they are leaving behind - cheering - a whole generation of young men is marching off to war
One girlfriend rushes up to kiss her leaving boyfriend
Albert watches Joey, then remembers the campaign pennant dangling from his pocket
He runs up to Joey - Joey
- and tucks the pennant into Joey's halter
Here now, 've told you - sling your hook
But Nicholls intervenes from his car
Let him be, Perkins
This isn't the end
This isn't the end, my brother
, Albert Narracott, solemnly swear we will be together again
Wherever you are, will find you
And  will bring you home
And then they are past him, leaving him behind
As Perkins leads Joey across a stone bridge, Albert watches from the bank of the stream
Joey balks one last time - 37
Whoa
Steady, steady
Steady now, come on
Walk on
Walk on now, come on
- then Perkins leads him away, leaving Albert behind
The very last recruits leave the village - leaving the debris of this army's visit strewn on the square
Like the debris of a party you are already beginning to regret
Joey is handed off to a groom
Joey is amazed by the scale of the building
Each horse has a large stall and is being tended to assiduously
Joey looks around at the hundreds of men and horses around him and panics
Whoa whoa whoa
Easy easy
He bucks, throwing the groom to the ground, and gallops away
But Perkins cuts him off, grabs his halter, and jerks him back to attention
Whoa whoa whoa, Joey
Stop muckin' about, you hear
Yer in the army now, son
He pushes him into his stall, next to Major Stewart's horse, a magnificent black stallion,
(') Good boy, good boy
Steady steady
Easy
Relax
Easy easy, back up
Joey rears up in his stall
(') Joey - meet Topthorn
Topthorn - this is Joey
Sort out who's in charge between the two of you, you hear
If you want to fight, you get it over with - `cause once we're over there, you're gonna need everything you've got for Fritz
This is the first time that Joey has had to deal with another horse since his mother - the beginning of one of the most important relationships in his life
Gently, Perkins
don't want to sour him
38
Nicholls passes his gloves and crop to his bat boy who is there to assist him
There'll be nothing gentle about the war, sir
And there'll be nothing gentle about this one either
(') understand that, Sergeant, but want him fit and shining
He's my horse
(') Sir
Nicholls is joined by his friend
He is sweet and friendly - upper class but completely benign
Scares the living daylights out of me
Who
Perkins
Glad he's on our side
They're both joined by a tall, confident officer, He sizes up Joey
Not bad
Not bad at all
Still not a patch on my Topthorn
wouldn't be so sure
think he's got potential
He's certainly got the bit between his teeth
actually think my Blenheim is faster than the pair of them
Clear off
He suddenly turns from the joking into the efficient senior officer he is
39
(') All right, gentlemen, listen here
Everything tells us the same story, from Waterloo to Omdurman, from Pickett's Charge to the Battle of Mars La Tours - the first attack can and should be the decisive one
Perkins
Yes, sir
No excuses, no mistakes - every horse groomed and fit for presentation
want a full practice charge tomorrow
Sir
They leave
The whole regiment is gathered
Everybody is in their ceremonial uniform
It all has the feeling of the Changing of the Guard rather than anything related to a real battle
The day is hot, the plains are quiet and beautiful, the gathering is huge, there is a real sense of pride and anticipation
Captain Nicholls, resplendent in full uniform rides Joey out over the vast expanse of the plain
Both Nicholls and Joey are dressed up like something from the last century, out of the Boer War, even the Charge of the Light Brigade
Nicholls is proud and confident
They gather before hundreds of men and horses all lined up to be inspected
Charlie joins them, looking pretty good on Blenheim
Finally, Nicholls and Charlie reach Stewart and Topthorn waiting in position
Thought you two had bottled out
As if
Nicholls looks at his friend tolerantly
All right, then, let's see what you two jokers are made of, shall we
40
This is what quiet confidence looks like
'll wait for you two at the Duke of York
Nicholls and Stewart and Charlie prepare themselves for the charge
Joey and Topthorn size up to one another
Over to you, Captain Nicholls
Topthorn bristles at Joey
Everyone is highly charged
The competition between Stewart and Nicholls seems to have been absorbed between the horses
Topthorn and Joey square up for the practice charge like two athletes before a race
Draw
swords
Nicholls raises his sword
It glints in the summer air
It seems to hang there forever
Every man follows suit
Topthorn and Joey glance at each other, ready to charge
(') Give
point
Every sword is pointed directly ahead at arm's length
(') Charge
roar goes up from the men and a deafening pounding of hooves breaks the silence
The huge line of horses start running straight ahead of them
Joey and Topthorn run off at top speed
Dust and earth rise up behind them
Bugles, the deafening thunder of hooves
It is exhilarating
We see the scale of the operation, we enjoy the speed and the splendor of the mass of men and horses
The soldiers shout in glee and excitement
Each man pushes his horse to out-run those around him, Nicholls and Stewart seem locked in mortal combat
Nicholls smiles at Stewart, confidently
Topthorn starts to pull away, ahead of all the other horses in the line
Nicholls pushes Joey on
Topthorn seems too strong, Joey will never catch them
Nicholls is determined not to be beaten
41
(') Come on, Joey
know you've got it
Come on, boy
Come on
He pushes Joey on
Joey digs in and finds hidden strength and speed
He starts to catch up with Topthorn and draws along side
Nicholls and Stewart exchange tense looks
(') Come on, boy
Stewart is amazed and pushes Topthorn harder
Now both riders are going at their top speed
They are neck and neck - they fight for every inch of advantage, every fibre of their being invested in the race
Nicholls pushes Joey on and Joey pulls away
Joey inches forward till he is almost a length ahead of Topthorn
The effort is enormous
Nicholls looks back at Stewart, very happy
Stewart's frustration shows
He knows he is beaten
Then suddenly they race over the line
Nicholls spears a ring decorated with a blue ribbon and pulls Joey to a halt
They have crossed the enemy line
Nicholls is ecstatic
Topthorn comes to Joey's side
Whoa
Whoa
Nicholls laughs, grinning
Nice of you to turn up
The horses are nose to nose, snorting, we sense the heat, the exertion
Topthorn and Joey are brought together by the effort
We sense Topthorn's newly minted respect for Joey
And Joey is no soft touch - he slightly holds his head up in victory, letting Topthorn know that he knows he won
The other horses come charging in
There is a real sense of achievement and congratulation amongst the regiment
He's got speed
'll give him that
But has he got stamina
He has everything
The two men enjoy the moment of rivalry and the exhilaration of it all
The two horses, face to face rub against each other for the first time
bond has been formed
42
'
Stewart enters
phonograph plays "Roses of Picardy
" The walls are decorated with etchings of famous battles, and a large map of Western Europe that depicts how the English troops are crossing the channel to confront the Germans near Belgium
Nicholls is writing a letter - though actually at this moment, he is making a little pencil drawing of Joey to enclose with it
What are you up to
'm writing a letter
With a picture in it
It's to the boy who owned Joey
want to show him how wonderful he's looking
Before we take him away across the Channel to face a million Germans guns
Yes
Before that
4 a
m
start tomorrow - travelling with the Dragoon Guards and the Royals
Transport detachment - they'll need to be at the docks at 5 am
Check all kit
Battle orders: no polishing - buttons, helmet buckles, stirrup irons - let `em all go dull
want nothing to flash in the sun and give us away
Of course
As Stewart leaves, he passes Charlie
He casually acknowledges him
Charlie
Jamie
Charlie
43
Charlie checks his new cap in the mirror
What do you think of the cap
He shows the bright red lining to Nicholls
(') Silk lining
quite like it
'm not sure it's going to make a lot of difference to the Germans
Oh,  don't know about that
Think about it - you're a Boche, just working out which of two chaps to shoot - and you thought - "Good Lord - one of them really is wearing a very stylish cap indeed
" You might shoot the other one instead
Or, alternatively, think - " fancy that cap" and kill you first of all
Pause
Charlie removes the cap
Hadn't thought of that
Nicholls returns to his sketch
Three hundred horses and their charges in a slow march in the middle of the most pristine French countryside
:  - 1914, Nicholls and Stewart and Charlie ride on a smooth road past a series of posts screened with cloth
They're silhouetted against the setting sun
The regiment are tense and nervous as they gingerly make their way along the country road
Topthorn and Joey sense the grim change of atmosphere
44
They are in woodland above a plain stretching for miles small table has been taken out for Stewart and his officers
- a turbaned Indian with a magnificent moustache dressed in ceremonial garb - explains the lines of battle on a map
That is our target - the German 11th Division - at the moment bivouacked three miles to the east of the Menin Road
We have been watching them and they have pitched tents for the night and lit cooking fires
Knock them out - and we could slide in behind the German lines and come at them from the South at Geluveld
Excellent
Numbers
About six hundred
Infantry
Twice our size
In regiments of horse and men, the advantage is ours
And we have surprise on our side
But the sooner we move, the better - we have no assurance they'll still be there tomorrow morning
Our officers just have a second to take in the news
The day has suddenly arrived
The day they have worked for, for so long
Right
Good
So - today it is
Charlie - tell the men
Salisbury formation
45
Salisbury formation
We'll charge through them and secure the ground behind
The grass to the left is taller than we are - it's perfect cover
Excellent work, Sergeant Major
Time spent on reconnaissance is rarely wasted
As Stewart departs: Thank you, Singh
( ) Jamie
Nicholls catches up to Stewart, concerned
(') They have no idea we're coming
Not having scruples, are you, Jim
No
understand the surprise is everything
But if it must be done, let's do it quickly
Nicholls notices Charlie nervously attending his horse
(') Are you alright, Charlie
Never been better
Literally, never better
We worry for him - he is afraid
Stewart rides through the lines astride Topthorn
Prepare to mount
Mount
As the cry is echoed throughout the regiment, Nicholls accepts Joey from an attending soldier
46
Thank you, Standley
( ) Hey, Joey
My bonny boy
You're all right, aren't you, Joey
Hey
Nicholls takes the red campaign pennant from his pocket and threads it through Joey's reins
Minutes later - Stewart addresses the men
Gentleman
It is an honour to ride beside you
Make the Kaiser rue the day he dared to cross swords with us
Let every man make himself, his King, his country, and his fallen comrades proud
Be brave
Fear God
Honor the King
(in unison shout) Fear God
Honor the King
Cut to an elegant field of tall grass, waving in the gentle breeze
Then suddenly three hundred men seem to rise out of it
They are in fact our soldiers, mounting their horses - but the horses are invisible in the height of the grass
Stewart gives a signal
We see the intense anticipation on his face
He takes out his sabre
Draw swords
The men draw their sabres in silence
The birds chirping, oblivious
Then Nicholls just turns to his two friends and almost whispers
Good luck, my friends
He pats Joey's side
And then
Forward, to walk
Walk
march
The regiment begins moving through the field
47
(') Forward to canter
Canter
march
The men start to float over the grass - swept along by their invisible horses, until
Suddenly they emerge from the tall grass - the immense power of the galloping horses - silence explodes into a violent crashing of hooves
The noise is immense, swords are flying in the air
Hundreds of horses racing towards the German encampment
On the German side,   wake to the sound of hoofbeats
They pull their tent flap aside to find the invincible charge coming towards them
The Germans are totally unprepared
We see them scramble back towards tents, rush towards their guns - one man pulling up his trousers rushes for cover
One German drops some dirty dishes into a wash pot, screaming: Kavallerie
Topthorn and Joey race each other like a rerun of their practice on Salisbury Plain
The swords and uniforms glint in the sun, the German troops look terrified - some run in panic, others prepare to stand their ground
The British head in for the kill, the men scream battle cries with sheer exhilaration
We see the horses at close quarters running with all their might
Nicholls and Stewart yell as they approach the enemy
The surprise attack is a huge success
The first row of unprepared Germans are falling
The regiment sweeps through the encampment, cutting down soldiers and driving the rest in a panicked retreat to the tree line
But then we see, in the shadows of the forest behind the -- machine gun
No, a line of machine guns - at least twenty guns, sandbagged apart - the logical, new, modern defence of a garrison
In an instant, the fleeing Germans have manned the guns
All now firing
48
The noise of the blast of bullets drowns out everything else
score of men and horses are suddenly on the ground, it happens almost so quickly Joey and Topthorn don't realize anything's wrong and find themselves racing straight towards the guns
The bullets keep coming, now suddenly half of the regiment are on the ground
Horse after horse races past the guns into the woods
all of them now riderless
Nicholls watches helplessly as one of the barrels swings towards him
His face goes slack as he realizes he is about to die
moment later, Joey runs on - we pan up to see he is running on riderless - he has not realized that Nicholls is gone
The bullets whizz around his head, but he still runs directly ahead
We would always know him by the red pennant Nicholls tied on his saddle
Joey is now running through the German lines
No one bothers to attack him as the German's concentrate their efforts on the cavalry behind him
The line of machine guns fire as one, decimating the horses and their riders
Joey leaps and dances nimbly through the German ranks, but suddenly rears up in the confusion, surrounded by Germans
Near him, surviving English officers are hauled from their horses
Stewart wheels back around on Topthorn, sabre in hand
But he, too, is quickly surrounded by several Germans with their rifles trained on him
furious   storms over, speaks perfect English: () What
Did you think that a garrison on open ground would go undefended
Look at yourself
Who do you think you are
Stewart looks at the Officer - at the guns that surround him - and throws down his sabre, stabbing it into the ground
The Germans take Stewart from Topthorn
Around them, the fields are littered with dead soldiers and horses
49
Topthorn appears disoriented and frightened
Suddenly, he rears up and bolts from his new German handler, galloping over to Joey
The horses briefly nuzzle, but both rear up again as they are separated and led past a young German soldier,
He zeroes in on them, the finest horses
slightly more   approaches the outraged senior officer
What do we do with the horses
If they're injured, shoot them
And the others, sir
The others you round up and take to base camp - they will pull guns
You'll never get fancy horses like these to pull guns
Then shoot them also
Gunther, the young private, now standing behind them, interjects
Sir - perhaps we could use some of them with the ambulances - to get the injured men off the field
Will they take the harness
'd like to try, sir
The officers move away - that's enough talk about horses
- Gunther is now with Joey and Topthorn
Near a wooden ambulance - which is like a giant wagon to carry humans
He is with , a very young soldier, his brother - possibly as young as 14
50
Gunther lifts a heavy pulling harness - and tries to get Topthorn into it
It won't work - they're cavalry Let's try
You won't get the harness on
Come on, Michael
Topthorn balks violently
(') Whoa, whoa
Easy, now, easy now, Englishman
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Easy now, easy
Gunther
It's hopeless - we can't help them
And suddenly Joey moves up and presents himself, with his strange self assurance and self sacrifice
And instinct for survival
He sniffs the harness and places his head through it, which helps to calm Topthorn enough that Gunther can slip the collar onto the big black horse
Gunther turns to Joey, impressed
Well, well, look at you
Whoever taught you this has just saved your life
Gunther spots the red ribbon in Joey's saddle, removes it, folds it, and places it in his pocket
Later - Gunther and Michael are returning from the battlefield with Topthorn and Joey, pulling an ambulance with British and German wounded
Amongst the wounded, we see a hand gripping a battered, silk lined hat
It is Waverly, wounded but alive
'
Si Easton lets himself in through the gate
Ted pulls up turnips from their three acre crop
51
Rosie, just across a furrow, is also engaged in the harvest
It's hard work
Si holds a parcel
Hello the farm
(looking up, wiping her ) Hello, Si Easton
Albert passes carrying a crate laden with turnips, but pulls up short when he hears: was at the post office and while was there, Mrs
Allen said a parcel had come for Albert, from the, from the, from over there - and  thought could go up that way in the morning
And - here it is
Well, who'd be sending me a parcel over there
Well, open it and see
Albert opens the parcel and pulls out a leather sketchbook
It's a sketchbook
(gasp of realization) That's Captain Nicholls' sketchbook
See that
That's a picture of Joey
It's a picture of Joey
Well, never
() And there's a letter
Well, go on then, go on
All right
() "Dear Albert Narracott
() 52
(') Captain Nicholls, who died
Captain Nicholls, who died in action today left you this
Yours, Sergeant Sam Perkins
Si Easton drops his head guiltily
Rosie catches this
You weren't to know it was bad news
He was riding Joey when he died
You don't know that he was riding him
"In action," it says
Everybody falls silent
Albert goes to the fence and looks down at the sketches of Joey
Rosie looks at her son, her heart breaking for him
Dad returns to the harvest without a word
Albert looks off to the horizon and - over there
--  step stool
Michael mounts the stool next to Joey and Topthorn, removes their harnesses and carries them across the road
Michael slips and falls into the mud
Gunther dashes over and pulls him up just before a military convoy pulls into the camp, running over the tack
The    appears on a motorbike
Gentlemen
We move forward to the frontline tonight
Full marching orders
Get moving
As the soldiers hop to their orders, the officer turns to - Schroeder
Schroeder
Both Michael and Gunther turn to him
But it's Gunther the Officer wants to talk to
(') No, not you - you
Come
53
Gunther picks up the dropped harnesses as he approaches
(') 'm keeping you here
You are best with the horses and we need to move the camp quickly if the enemy continue to push through from the west
They're pushing through
'm told
We will move later when we find where the horses are needed most
Yes, sir
Perhaps  can keep my brother here with me, he's also very good with horses
Oh no no
Not necessary
( ) Get moving
We leave tonight
He walks away
Gunther is stricken by the news, but Michael is excited
As he leads Joey past his brother: It's all right, Gunther
Gunther can't really speak
Michael is just a boy
/
Soldiers are lifting up their equipment - gathering - moving in the same direction
In a quiet tent, a few last soldiers are packing
And there are Gunther and Michael, packing together
You are not going
'll tell them you are only fourteen, that you're a boy
Father signed me in
He knew my age -and so do they
54
The process of packing is their way of coping with the shock
Gunther is folding one of Michael's shirts
Michael takes it back
(') Mother obviously never taught you how to fold a shirt
Of course she did
just wasn't listening
But you need to listen now
promised her,  made her a solemn promise, that you would be safe with me
With me, Michael
He leans close to Michael, talking in almost a whisper
(') They'll never make a head count
There are too many of us
You can stay here - slip underneath the bed - until they move out
Then what
Michael carries on with his packing
(') Gunther, it will be fine
And when all the machines break down and they call up the horses, 'll see you at the front
We'll be together again
And now the case is packed
Gunther heads to the tent opening
(') Gunther
Looking round, the tent is now empty
The moment to leave has come
Gunther pulls the red pennant from his pocket and follows Michael out of the tent to where the soldiers are lining up in the road
'm giving this to you
For luck
Gunther ties the pennant to the back of Michael's pack as he forms up
(') To keep you safe
55
Michael smiles at him and begins to march
Marching towards Ypres, on the Western Front
Im schnellschritt
Marsch
links
Zwei, drei, vier
We settle on young Michael - in line - he passes Gunther
He remains eager
But it is goodbye
These soldiers moving into the darkness and towards death
Gunther looks on - tears in his eyes
The two horses are uneasy - sensing tension
few minutes later - Gunther grabs a saddle and throws it onto Joey's back
Back to the soldiers
Suddenly we see the galloping legs of two horses
They whip past the back of the line of marching soldiers
It's clear what is happening - Gunther is on Topthorn - and has hold of Joey, on a loose rope, galloping beside him
Gunther, galloping along the line of soldiers, spots what he is looking for, a red pennant unfurled and flapping in the wind, tied onto Michael's pack
Gunther speeds toward him
This was his plan all along
And in an instant he is beside him and without Michael ever realizing, he suddenly finds his arms and legs akimbo, as he is yanked out of the line and dragged along the ground, desperately close to Joey's pounding hooves
Michael looks at the soldiers beside him - he looks at the skyline of violence ahead
but before he can decide, he feels his brother's arm - pulling him upwards
And now, the two of them are fully on Topthorn
They leave a jumble of soldiers in their wake as the officers try to restore order
Get back in line
Line
Michael now rides Joey, following Gunther on Topthorn
The brothers look at each other - can't believe what they have done - Michael is following his brother, swept along, doesn't know if it is right
And Michael and Joey and Gunther and Topthorn charge on to freedom
They spot a lonely house and burst past a line with some drying clothes
56
As they ride, they grab civilian shirts and jackets and trousers, the clothes pegs pinging off and falling to the ground
And on they ride - though all too soon day starts to break in the far distance
They see a very dilapidated windmill
They aim for it as the sun begins to seriously break over the horizon
/
They reach the windmill
It feels very unused
The machinery of the windmill creaks in the dawn
The brothers untether the horses, careful now that it is light outside
'm hungry
Did you bring food
'm sorry
Michael fingers the pennant on Joey's reins
Then
Will Father be ashamed
He will pretend to be
Maybe at first he will be
But in the end, he will be glad
And us
What about us
Gunther looks at him - but doesn't reply
As Michael removes ' : (') was ready to go
was proud to go
(after a beat, in a very ) wanted to go
Later - They sit in silence, waiting for sleep
(') The food in Italy is good
Yes
What about the women
57
Not as good as the food
Because
they've eaten too much of the food
You are too young for war
And you're too young for women
Gunther laughingly pushes him over
don't feel so young
Not anymore
(') Michael
(') What
Go to sleep - we have a big night of riding ahead
Goodnight, Michael
He jokingly strokes Michael's cheek
Michael swats him away, but as he settles in the hay: Night night, Gunther
Gunther and Michael sleep
Suddenly something awakens Joey
He stirs and then rises
Hear the sound of engines and see lights through the slats sweeping across Joey's face
Michael and Gunther are stirring in their sleep as we hear a car and several motorcycles approaching
Head-lamps filter through the cracks in the windmill walls stabbing the brothers awake
Hei
In die windmuhle
The boys spring up, speaking in terrified whispers
Go, go, go
Okay
58
They race up a nearby ladder, but Michael stumbles against a table, upsetting some gear
It clatters loudly
They cower as they hear boots tromping up the steps outside
Then the windmill doors are thrown open, pinning them in the bright headlights of the vehicles
As they're marched out, we see what they see:  German car - two motorcycles
Six Germans, including the officer who was in charge of them
Schroeder
Yes, sir
mistake
He's offering an excuse, but - promise
The officer accepts this grimly, nods
Ja
As the boys are taken away, he lights a cigarette
Through the turning arms of the windmill, we glimpse the double execution
Four rifles fire - flashes of the soldiers shooting - the bodies on the ground
Complete stillness in the empty countryside
There are Joey and Topthorn, still waiting
And then suddenly - the doors of the windmill creak
The two horses turn, immensely aware of the break in the silence
The door opens a little - and we see, reflected in Joey's eye, a very delicate, beautiful, thirteen-year-old country girl ()
She stares at the horses
They stare straight back at her
And she walks straight out again, closing the big door behind her
Joey and Topthorn settle for a moment
59
Time transition - Joey and Topthorn are in a slightly different place - and the door opens again
It is the same little girl - but this time she comes in carrying two buckets full of water
/
/
small humble farmhouse - and round it, small fields, planted with different fruit crops
We see an old man (), burdened with a basket of berries heading back towards the farmhouse
-- far in the distance the    is in the sky
He enters the kitchen - which is rough, but full of the paraphernalia of jam-making - jars, sieves, pectin, sugar
Emilie is at the sink, washing berries
Grandpere
He heads towards the side-board, dumps the two bags and lifts the first handful of fruits on to the counter
She empties her clean berries into a bowl
Notes the explosions outside
(') It's closer today
The wind plays tricks with the noise - it's moving away from us
can hear it, Grandpere, and there is no wind
You shouldn't lie to me
Here
There is no wind here
But over there - a wind so strong it will lift you off the ground
You lie about everything
You say you aren't worried but it's clear you are
know the war is approaching but you say, "Oh, it's just a trick of the wind
" He retrieves a bottle of medicine from the mantle
60
() Did  say that
You started lying when Mama and Papa went away
She pours a load of sugar into a bowl with the fruit
(') They're dead
But you won't say so
Do you think 'll die if you tell me the truth
The truth is - He feeds her a spoonful of the medicine
(') - you should speak to your elders with respect
She sticks her wet finger in the sugar and sucks it to help with the taste of the medicine
If you tell me the truth about the war,  will tell you the truth about the big horses 've been keeping in the windmill
(standing, putting his hands on his hips) Now - who is the one telling lies
Grandfather looks stunned as he paces in front of - who stand in the small courtyard outside the house
In the windmill
Yes
They were standing in the windmill waiting for Don Quixote
This is Francois (Joey) and this is Claude (Topthorn)
61
Yeah
named them after two boys who broke my heart last Summer
They must belong to someone
Horses like this don't just appear from a fairy-tale
Yes -  know, Grandpere
They are not unicorns - so  will be fair and wait -- one day
Emilie
Emilie
And if no one comes to get them by night-time, then they belong to me
Emilie
Look at me
You cannot ride
Mother used to tell me how my bones would give way with the slightest bump or fall
Yes
That's right
So it is settled
She kisses his cheek -- (') Good girl
-- but then calmly leads the horses back to the windmill
It will only be settled when decide which one to ride first
But it's - Over my dead body
At least  won't have long to wait
62
That is the end of the conversation as far as she is concerned
Emilie is with the horses in the little stable at the end of the courtyard - a bit away from the farm house - she is feeding them out of a bucket - not very nice gruel - that she has spent no time around horses
( ) was in love with a boy called Francois - who had your lovely eyes
( ) Unfortunately he was in love with a girl called Marie, who had your teeth
She fell for a boy called Claude - who broke my heart
And who intend to marry one day
/
Grandfather watches Emilie from inside the house as he makes jam
(
) Eyes on me
No talking
Outside, Emilie has fashioned two jumps
The big one for Joey and a little demonstration obstacle for herself
She leads Joey to a starting point about 30 yards in front of some crates supporting a stick about four feet off the ground
The red pennant hangs from the stick
Joey stands quietly as Emilie hobbles to the big jump, making a jumping gesture with her hand
(') Today we learn to jump
Did you know the French cleared one meter eighty- five at the Paris Olympics to win the gold medal
Today we will beat that record
Grandfather chuckles
Emilie indicates the larger barrier
(') This is your jump
When  call you
be very brave and leap over it
She claps, but Joey doesn't move
63
(') Leap over it
Watch me
She turns to her demonstration jump and easily steps over her six-inch high barrier
(') And now it's your -- She turns to find Joey already stepping over her mini-jump, stopping in front of her
He's only interested in the apple in her hand
She takes a bite herself
: Emilie returns Joey to the starting line and runs back behind the big jump
From behind her back she produces three big carrots dripping soil
Joey's ears perk and he takes off quickly but at the last moment veers right and passes between the two jumps
Grandfather is watching through the window as he prepares his strawberry jams
He laughs and goes back to work
Aware she's being watched, she slings the carrots over her shoulder, frustrated
: Joey slowly emerges from the barn with Emilie out in front leading him with one hand
In the other hand, she carries a small wooden step ladder
He doesn't think we can do it
But we will show him, won't we
Emilie unfolds the ladder beside Joey and shakily starts climbing to the top of it
(') (Her voice shaking) No need to be afraid
(Emilie looking down at how far off the ground ) You are
very tall
64
Before she can swing her leg over Joey's back - You'll kill yourself
Emilie turns, and there, blocking the hurdle, now standing hands on hips, is Grandfather
Only if you get in my way to make me fall
Oh please, come off the ladd-- from far down the road
Grandfather looks
Emilie turns to look too
Two trucks led by a German motorcycle are approaching the farm
(') Find somewhere to hide them
And do it quickly
As Emilie races off with the horses, Grandfather pushes over the jumps and jams the pennant into his pocket
The bikes arrive first, just missing Emilie as she leads the horses behind the house
The trucks arrive, pull round - one of the soldiers in the front jumps out and opens the back
Halt
Und aussteigen
The people - 20 of them, all seeming to be poor French peasants, mainly women, move out of the truck
As they walk past, they avoid the eye of the Grandfather, who approaches the soldiers
My name is Bonnard - this is my land
Why are you here
Food for the soldiers at the front
Everyone must give their share
And suddenly we see what is going to happen - the 20 peasants spread out and move through the field - with either bags, or using the aprons they wear - picking all the fruits - at just the moment all the work has brought forth fruit - and the new year's crop is ready
65
Raspberries, black-currants, gooseberries
In a few minutes, everything he lives by will be gone
Watching from his car and calmly smoking a cigar is , the officer in charge of the unit
Cut to the fields - the aprons and baskets are getting full
They move through the rows of fruit like a plague of locusts
Back to the Grandfather - and out of the house comes Emilie
They are taking everything
Where are the horses
Pause
What horses
The sound of jars breaking draws Grandfather and Emilie into the kitchen, where the Germans continue to raid their other supplies
One German picks up waterbath canner -- inspecting it
What is it
Leave it if you don't know what it's for
pot is a pot
We'll find some use for it
Sir, where's the livestock
Brandt sits quietly, casually using his finger to scoop jam from an open jar
make jam
We have no animals
But there's fresh hay in your barn
Emilie enters, overhearing
We use it to replace the mattress stuffings
Her grandfather
66
Yes
Where are her parents
( ) They're dead
They died
The German nods and is about to take his leave, putting the pot back where he found it, when a clumping noise from somewhere in the house begins
What is that
The wind
It plays tricks in the attic
Brandt licks his finger and tests: There is no wind
An old house creaks
( ) Go - close the shutters
Emilie runs out of the room
The soldier picks up the medicine bottle
She's sickly, no
If you or any of your friends harm her, as old as  am,  will kill you
The soldier looks shocked and then begins to laugh
He slaps the medicine flask into Grandfather's chest
You know,  was going to give you back your pot
But now 'm going to keep it
For soup
He slings the huge pot he had put back up on his shoulder and leaves the house with the other soldiers
67
We will be back in the new season
As the Germans leave, we cut to the upstairs bedroom where Emilie lies curled up on the bed - and there, standing on either side of the bed - are the two horses
They look huge in the tiny room
The sound of shells exploding
huge bombardment somewhere in the deep distance
But much closer than before
The distant, malicious giants of war growl
It is like a lightning storm on the horizon
The kitchen has been emptied
The war has finally come to them - and we can see it on Emilie's face
Tell me what happened to them
To my mother and father
Grandfather doesn't respond
(') You said you would tell me how they died
On my birthday
And tomorrow's my birthday
They died fighting, didn't they
But when the soldiers - She finally turns to face him
(') - you do nothing
You are a coward, aren't you
Yes
Yes
It was your parents who were brave
make jams
And you've never done a brave thing in your life
He eases himself into a chair and shrugs
Maybe there are different ways to be brave
Did you know the French have the best carrier pigeons
And this could be the difference in the war - our messages getting through
68
don't want to hear about the birds
They are released at the front and told to go home - this is all they know
But to get there they must fly over a war
Can you imagine such a thing
Here you are flying over so much pain and terror - and you know you can never look down
You have to look forward or you'll never get home
ask you - what could be braver than that
Emilie sheds a single tear
Grandfather enters the barn, strokes Topthorn's nose as he passes
He sweeps aside a rug from the barn floor, to reveal a trap door
Then, he opens it
Now from out of the trap door, he lifts a big ungainly object, covered in another rug
Emilie comes down the stairs as Grandfather waits proudly by the stove
She stops when she sees the What is that
present
Emilie moves toward the object that is covered
hope you have not bought me a disgusting dress that  then have to wear like last year
() It was disgusting
Yes
looked like an ugly nun
69
Then she stops herself and turns to Grandfather with a parental rebuke
(') Give me your hand
(she takes it in hers) Grandpere, we have no money
When the war is over, then you can buy me jewels and carriages
The grandfather smiles and gives Emily a hug
Anything you say, my sweet one
Anything-you-say
You are, of course, the boss
It's just an old thing  found - don't worry yourself - leave it, 'll put it back
He leaves the room
Now Emilie is alone and she can't help it when she brings her eyes back to the object covered by the rug
She looks back over her shoulder to make sure she's not being watched and then lifts one corner of the rug
Her face explodes with a gorgeous smile
She pulls off the rug that is covering the big thing and
it is a gorgeous old saddle
She runs her hand along the saddle -- can hardly believe it
Grandfather helps to swing Emilie up and into the saddle
All at once, the Grandfather's charity evaporates
It was your mother's
hid it, so as not to encourage you
Emilie, want you to ride very slowly, very carefully
And promise me you won't go far -- Of course
Okay,  promise
To the top of the hill and straight back again
promise
Emilie unties her hair and tosses the red pennant to Grandfather, releasing her hair to spill down her back and shoulder
70
(') My hero
She sets off on Joey - and quickly spurs him to a gallop
Slowly
slowly
She rides - past the windmill - and then over the top of a nearby hill - she speeds over it and out of sight
Back to the hill - a sudden change of mood
An empty shot
No movement, no returning girl
(') Emilie
Cut again to the top of the hill, then back to the Grandfather, very worried
(') Emilie
Topthorn suddenly rears up - and charges off following, sensing danger
Grandfather starts to run in the direction of the hill
Topthorn charging over the brow of the hill
The Grandfather running - out of breath
He hears an indistinct scream from Emilie
He reaches the top of the hill - comes over the brow - and there is not the fallen body of Emilie, which he has been fearing, but a brutal line of German soldiers - and motorbikes
It is like a line of Indians in a Western - total, alien fear
And there amongst them is Emilie, astride a panicked Joey, surrounded by soldiers
Another one holds Topthorn, who bucks and rears, but to no avail
Grandfather starts down the hill towards his granddaughter
The Germans are moving through the horses they have gathered
Emilie, unhorsed, tries to get to Joey, who is being roughly led away by a German soldier
No
Let go of me
No
71
Grandfather grabs her
She is screaming
He tries to calm her down
Joey is tied up as is Topthorn
Emilie is kicking and screaming - but also desperately short of breath
She is my granddaughter
Emilie, stop
Don't hurt her, please
Don't hurt her
soldier roughly shoves Emilie at him
Brandt approaches
Emilie screams at him, in tears
You don't need them
There are so many others
Emilie is still sobbing
Grandfather hugs her - in horror that she is now struggling so hard for breath
Please, take the bigger one and leave the smaller one
You are breaking my granddaughter's heart
() The war has taken everything from everyone
( ) What will happen to them
They will pull artillery until they - () Francois
- or until the war is over
It will never be over
You have your answer then
The motorbikes start up and drive off
The Grandfather hugging tiny Emilie as she coughs
72
The Germans disappear up the lane leaving the old man and the child bereft in the bitter cold
Two grooms trail Brandt, leading Joey and Topthorn toward a makeshift corral
Heiglemann - these are yours
Yes, sir
They look strong - should last a month or two
is an unprepossessing, chubby man
He marvels at Topthorn
You are beautiful
But then he looks to the other horses penned nearby, haggard and weak
He turns to Joey
(') It's a pity they found you
He takes the leads of the pair of them
He sighs
(') Such a pity
In a strange way, there are many humans Joey meets, but also just one, the spirit of goodness and consideration for animals, joined by little echoes throughout the film
And then they go over a ridge - and we suddenly see the explanation of Friedrich's comment
The road they can see below them is the main through road of the area - and it is a scene of horse horror - huge, massive guns and cannons and artillery being dragged by teams of horses that are in a terrible condition
For Joey and Topthorn, this is a moment like when soldiers arrived to liberate the prisoners who had been kept in Changi prison by the Japanese during World War 2
They have never seen horses in this condition
You can see in their eyes the confusion
This is a whole different world, where horses can turn into creatures that look like this
73
And it is also a vision of their future
This may be the moment the mighty Topthorn begins to lose hope
For Joey it is another level of knowledge - another mighty thing he will fight through - because he always fights through
Friedrich leads Joey and Topthorn in the wake of - an elaborate 15 ton monstrosity with a six inch bore
It takes a team of six horses to haul it with a dozen men pushing from behind
Pull together
soldier calls from the front of the heavy cannon - pulled by a particularly wretched group of horses
Halt
Halt
Stop
Lower down the hill, Friedrich waves down the rest of the column
Stop
Stop
At the front of the Morser, one of the lead horses collapses - he will never get up again
Brandt steps up, pulls a revolver out of his pocket and shoots the horse dead
It has come to this
Joey, Topthorn, and all the other horses are spooked by the pistol shot
Brandt shouts to Friedrich from the road
Heiglemann, bring up another one
Heiglemann, bring up another horse
That one
Friedrich begins leading Joey up the hill, but -- (') No, no
The big black one
Friedrich hauls Topthorn, hesitantly, while Joey watches
74
As he reaches Brandt: He's a good horse, sir
But if you move him up to the heavy gun, he will be no use at all
Prince is already losing condition
His leg, sir
You have given them names
Yes, sir
You should never give a name to anything you are certain to lose
His leg is not good enough, sir
Private, you will do as you are told
( ) Hook him up
Friedrich has no choice but as he starts to lead Topthorn, Joey rears up and escapes his groom
He gallops up the hill to the gun - offering himself up to save Topthorn
It is his "Tale of Two Cities" moment - giving up his life to save his friend
He bucks and rears
Friedrich turns to Brandt
As you see, sir, this one is stronger
Brandt takes up Friedrich, and Joey's, offer - Hook him up
As Joey is hooked to the gun, he looks back to Friedrich who leads Topthorn back down the hill
The convoy struggles up the hill
Joey feels the dead weight of the gun
These are several tons of cast iron - almost dwarfing the horses
Friedrich notices
Together, this grim circus struggles along the pot-holed country road in the rain
75
Joey leads the team up the incline
Each step is an immense effort
The going, over rough scree, is very tough indeed
It is very difficult for Joey to get a foothold on the loose ground, but his experience in Dartmoor comes into play and although he almost loses his balance several times he stays upright and hauls the cannon - Fitzcarraldo-like - over the hill
We follow his progress step by step
Friedrich watches anxiously
Soldiers strain at the sides of the gun
One throws boards under the wheels to aid in traction
As they reach the top of the hill it almost seems the effort is too much, the cannon always in danger of rolling back
Joey finally staggers over the top - it feels as though the tethers are going to snap with the strain - but at last the cannon reaches the peak, the crest of the hill
Soldiers scurry around the giant gun, preparing it
Halt
Halt
Take the horses away
Shell
Friedrich observes with Topthorn as a giant shell is carried to the gun's breech
(') And load
The men wrestle it into place - (') Back
Case
- and secure it
(') Position
The barrel of the giant gun ratchets upward
(') And
fire
The shell explodes from the barrel
And then from another
And another
For the first time we see the big picture - the line of assembled cannons of which they were just one tiny part
76
Each gun recoils violently as they shoot their shells into oblivion - as soon as one shell is fired another is loaded - the noise is deafening - the line seemingly endless - an obscene production line of death
This is what the horses have been feeding - this massive merciless thing
Smoke wafts from the guns as we see the explosions in the distance
The sound of the explosions takes us to - Explosions light the dirty faces of British boys in uniform, one after the next
Each light fading out before the next great blast illuminates another anonymous face -then another - and then another - and then
Hold on him for extra moments before he fades completely
:  - 1918, With the barrage lifted, the British soldiers that are huddled in a low sub-trench, are ordered back on the line
Andrew Easton is with Albert and he's shaken and terrified far cry from the happy young boy we knew
gruff sergeant ( ) walks the trench with a bucket and each soldier puts in their valuables and personal belongings
One a lighter, some money, etc
Valuables in the bucket, lads
If you live, you'll get them back
If you live, you'll get them back
Good lads
Albert and Andrew move down the trench in a line of soldiers who are given ammo belts and grenades
Albert gets his grenades and walks further along the trenches
We follow him in real time as he passes a bunch of soldiers who are kneeling in the ankle deep water, a  is giving them communion
The deafening noise of shelling all around
Maybe it's a drill, Albie
Maybe it's a drill like last time
We keep following Albert's progress in real time - further on there is a post box where they all put their final letters home in identical green envelopes
We see Albert's letter addressed to "Ted and Rose Narracott" in Devon
He posts it in a battered metal post box
77
An officer approaches: Love letter
That's my business
It is David - Lyon's son - now in charge of this small group of men
Still arrogant - looking older than Albert in his uniform - and clearly enjoying his superior rank
hear you and your mate were doing bird imitations again
You gonna write a letter to your horse
Albert ignores him
Andrew can't help but giggle
(') After you find your horse, 've lost my needle in a haystack, and  could use some help
David takes up a bucket and walks down the line of soldiers
(') Anything valuable
Anyone who comes back gets to share it out
( ) Stay here
Albert follows David down the trench
(') Remember that day me and Joey raced you in your car
remember you somersaulting through the air
Who was that girl you were with
There was a girl
Albert nods
There was
Don't you remember
78
It was just some girl,  suppose don't recall which one
do remember you falling on your bum in a ditch
Andrew laughs amiably
David points to him, smirking
(') You see
Always entertaining, Narracott, 'll give you that
As David walks on, Andrew smiles at Albert
You did that
You fell on your bum
Albert leaves without answering
Andrew keeps smiling until a large shell explodes nearby
Troops surge towards their ladders as officers scream indistinct orders
Now David leads his troop through the trenches to the front line where they stop, lean against the enemy-side wall nervously and wait - each man in private contemplation
Sergeant Martin moves along the lines, pushing men forward
Be ready
Be ready
Let's go, men, get ready to go
Get ready to move out
Stay in position
David calls out from atop a trench ladder
Hold your nerve, boys
Remember, it's not far to go
There's a way through
(he moves down the line) Run fast, keep your wits about you, keep your eyes open and God and the King will keep an eye on you
Company will fix bayonets
Fix bayonets
The echo of `fix bayonets' goes down the line - and every man fixes the brutal shining bayonet to the end of his gun
Then Albert turns to Andrew
You know what it reminds me of out there
79
What
That bloody impossible lower field the day me and Joey plowed it
Best day of my life that was and you were there
And this here is the worst day of my life, about to begin, and you're here cheering me on
Us two, always
And him
He nods at David Lyons, who gives instructions to another soldier
Once you're in no man's land, go to the flanks
Stay on the flanks
Yes, sir
David turns to Albert and Andrew
Come on, boys, come on
To the ladder
( ) Stick close to the gentry, that's our ticket, yeah
We have the pluck but they have the luck
They both smile
And then the fear takes over again
Andrew particularly feels as though he is on the very edge now
David urges them forward
You, too, Narracott
( ) And you, too
Andrew and Albert pass by the bucket
They throw some valuables in
But a moment later, Albert goes back to the bucket and pulls something out - a worn piece of paper - he unfolds it - it is the little sketch that Captain Nicholls drew of Joey the night before they left for France
He slips it inside his shirt, next to his heart
80
(') Come on, on your ladders, boy
On your ladders
In you go, in you go
That's it
Andrew turns towards a ladder
As fate and placement would have it - he is first in line
He puts his foot on the ladder, when suddenly the Sergeant stops him
Listen to your sergeant
He pulls Andrew aside, speaking so that everyone can hear
(') If anybody turns back, if any one of our boys come running towards you - you take this rifle and you shoot them dead
Do you understand
Yes, sir
The sergeant pushes in on Andrew, private and intense
Do you understand me
Do you understand what 'm telling you, son
You take this rifle and you shoot them dead
Understand
Andrew looks ready to cry, but manages to nod
Albert turns to him, only to be pushed back by the sergeant
(') Up there, son
Up your ladder
Up your ladder to your work
Albert looks nervously back at Albert, comforting
It's good
Andrew, it's good
Andrew
Nobody's retreating today
Andrew
Andrew
Nobody
Is retreating
Today
The  arrives, checks the time on his 's watch, mounts his ladder and blows a whistle to signal the charge
plays as the men go over the top
David now heads up the ladder first
Gun fire overhead, Albert steels himself, then hauls himself over the top, followed by the next man and the next
81
Immediately machine gun fire whistles past, we hear the screams of the first men who are shot
We follow Albert
We are him
His vision
His experience
The ground is blasted, there are bodies all around him
He tries to run but his feet sink into the mud
Bullets fly past him
Felled men are screaming at his feet in fear and agony
Albert staggers forward
David is now right by him
They run together
Albert looks round and suddenly, David is hit
He falls to the ground, screaming
'm shot
No
Albert instinctively goes to help
Bullets shower all around him
(') Just leave me
Leave me
Albert grabs him and drags him onwards with him - David screaming at the pain - Albert grimly determined
Shells explode around them as they stumble on
Other men are running and falling
Albert sees cover in a huge shell-hole so dives into it for a moment's reprieve from the gun fire
He sits in still terror for a moment
You'll be all right here
You'll be safe
Someone'll come for ya
Albert
Albert, listen
It's all right
It's all right
We're Devon boys, yeah
David looks at Albert as though seeing him for the first time
Yeah
Albert races onward
Back at the trench, Andrew waits - terrified - and then, back out of the mist step two men - heading back towards him
Then a third
They suddenly catch sight of Andrew waiting there with his gun pointed towards them
They slow down - in the terror of the assault, they had forgotten that death was waiting for them if they turned back
82
Time seems to slow down - Andrew shifts his gun from pointing at one - to the other - we see their individual faces
They are all just boys really
And suddenly, instinct hits Andrew - he charges up the ladder, and forward, firing - past the three men, towards the enemy
He chooses his death instead of theirs
sudden barrage of machine gun fire all around him
Cut back to Albert, who makes his way to the edge of the shell hole
Bullets whizz inches from his head
He looks over to see a German machine gun position to his right
Bullets whizz past forcing him to duck
Andrew charges past other soldiers, ignoring their warnings
Get down
Albert continues forward to dive into another shell hole, nearer to the German line
He scrambles from shell hole to shell hole
Now he's very close to the machine gun position
Albert takes a grenade, fumbles with the pin as his hands tremble
He finally gets the pin out and he hurls the grenade at the machine gunner
We see the explosion and the machine gun stop
Albert sprints over the top again and makes it all the way into the German trench
Albert runs through the trench, which seems curiously empty
Albert swings round as he sees the startling face of a gas- masked German holding a rifle on him
Albert readies his bayonet but the man is dead, slumped backwards against the side of the trench still upright
Albert spins round, his bayonetted rifle in front of him, ready for action, but there is only the ghostly sight of dead German soldiers
Albert is alone, everyone else is dead
All the dead wear gas masks
More British soldiers drop into the trench, among them Andrew
He stumbles in the mud, drops his rifle, recovers it, and races through the trench
He glimpses Albert ahead of him, stalking through the mist
Andrew breaks into a smile and rushes forward, prompting Albert to whirl with his rifle raised
83
Albert pauses just in time
Then he collapses against the side of the trench, overwhelmed
(') Albie
Andrew grabs Albert and holds him up, embracing him
Albert can barely whisper: We made it
We made it
moment later, the pair of them hurry through the trenches
Albert spots more comrades around a corner and calls ahead to Andrew
(') Andrew, this way out
Suddenly   leaps from a trench branch between them, shouting in panic
Gas
Gas
Gas
An instant later, a gas cloud blasts through the trench
Andrew and Albert look in horror
It spreads towards them, too powerful to avoid
Andrew is closest, turns to Albert with a helpless - Albie
- before he takes the full power of it
An instant later, the white, deadly cloud encompasses Albert, too
Close on hooves and boots, slogging through muddy water, several inches deep
Friedrich is walking along, leading Topthorn and Joey
Topthorn is limping
Something is wrong - Topthorn seems to be failing - he coughs badly, breathes strangely
Friedrich stops to check on him
An officer notices
Hey, there's no stopping here
Keep them moving
84
Sir, there's something wrong
This one needs to rest
There's no rest for them
Move them along
Move them along
Instead, Friedrich leads the horses under the cover of a low bridge for a brief respite
moment later, Topthorn collapses
Please, please, please
Stay on your feet
No, please
No no no
Friedrich tries to help Topthorn valiantly struggling to get up but finally sinks to the ground again
This time he lies semi-conscious
He is dying
(') Please please
Stay on your feet
Joey deeply upset nuzzles his nose into Topthorn but the life drains out him
Friedrich is in panic at Topthorn's quick : (') Come on
Please please
Friedrich continues to stroke Topthorn's head
Joey pushes Topthorn as if to stop him falling into unconsciousness
For a moment we think Topthorn will come round but he slips away and all life leaves his body
Friedrich solemnly strokes the horse, knowing all is lost
Joey does not understand
He pulls at Topthorn's reins, as if trying to pull him upright
Topthorn's body is inert, his head falls to the earth
Joey will not give up, he pulls at him desperately not understanding that Topthorn has died
Suddenly, Friedrich looks around
Chaos - all the German soldiers stream back past their position, scrambling to get their guns and helmets
An officer charges down the bank next to the bridge, screaming orders at Friedrich
They're coming
Leave it, private
Friedrich tries to pull Joey away to safety but Joey will not leave Topthorn's body
Friedrich pulls at Joey, but Joey is too lost in his grief to care about or even notice the danger
85
(') Leave it
Come with me
Go to hell
The officer nods to two other soldiers who pull Friedrich to safety
As he's dragged away, he screams at Joey: (') Run
Run
Run
Run
But this is all background noise to Joey's profound refusal to accept Topthorn is dead
He paws at the ground next to Topthorn, a horse standing over his best friend in a field, and he will never leave him
And then suddenly - from around a blind turn in the streambed, a huge, remorseless tank turns, heading right for Joey
He bolts, galloping down the streambed, until he reaches a barbed wire barrier - a dead end
He attempts to run up the banks, but they're blocked, as well
He rears up, but the tank keeps advancing
The tank is about to crush Joey
He has left it too late
He is about to die
But then, counter-intuitively, he runs straight towards the tank and
leaps over it - a leap he learnt from Emilie
Then scrambles up and over it and leaps down behind
Joey keeps on running
He is wild, frightened
/  /
Joey is free - in countryside - but there is blood pouring from his leg, clearly torn by his encounter with the tank
He runs on - it is becoming night - suddenly there are explosions to the left of him - this fast, elegant creature simply runs through the gaps between explosions
But as he charges on - the sky lights up in the direction he is heading
He is suddenly in the thick of battle
shell explodes next to him, and he leaps entirely over a trench
Another explosion sends him leaping, but not far enough - he finds himself crashing downwards, and into a trench - and he races through it - and finds himself charging towards a German company
Both sides are equally startled - Joey charging through a thin trench lined with German soldiers - the soldiers, finding a live horse careering through them
In desperation, Joey scrambles out of the trench - and once again, rushes away from the fighting
86
But now it is very dark indeed - he is stumbling as he runs - there is blood mixed with the mud on his legs
Now it is total night - fog - confusion - he jumps again
And now everywhere there are potholes - the land is massively uneven - shells are exploding all around
And suddenly sees in front of him barbed wire
He crashes through it - more - he bursts through again - now dragging barriers behind him - the barriers tangle, pulling him up short - he flips and lands amongst even more barbed wire
He pulls and turns to release himself but it is impossible
The more he pulls, the more firmly he is trapped
He rises up, wild, magnificent, a beast fighting for his life
He is completely trapped
He cannot move
He cannot see
He is in pain
He falls
It feels like an end
(
) Stand to, stand to - young soldier, a Geordie, is on look-out duty
He looks through a periscope
He alerts his colleague in his thick, northern, Newcastle accent
(') There's something moving
What the hell is it
It looks like a cow
He passes the periscope to the second soldier
What the hell would a cow be doing out there
We see what he sees - nothing but morning mist on the surreal landscape - and something strange
It is Joey in the distance 2 That definitely isn't a cow
(handing over periscope) Well, what is it
87
We see an almost identical scene of several German soldiers looking out at Joey just as the British soldiers had done
It can't be a horse
Nothing alive could be out there
It isn't a horse
It isn't a horse
The first German looks through his periscope
We see what he sees - Joey in the mist: Yes - it's a horse
The second German looks through the periscope, stunned
It's a horse
third German () lowers his binoculars
Yeah, it's a horse
Now all the soldiers are gathering to look out at Joey now has the periscope
Well, bugger me
It's a horse
Lads, we should call him
How do you call a horse
The Geordie starts clicking his tongue, followed by all of his comrades
They all try to attract Joey's attention with tongue clicks
The Germans hear the clicks and respond with a chorus of whistles
Now both sides are whistling
Even the captain joins in
88
'
Joey tries to rise, but remains entangled
He whinnies in pain
Peter lowers his binoculars
He's caught on the wire
,
Oh sod it
Geordie climbs up the side of the trench, and waves a white handkerchief tied to the end of his bayonet
What do you think you're doing
Get back, do you hear me
Corporal, that's an order
Get back
Geordie, not receiving fire, is emboldened to stand up
Listen to him, sir
We can't leave him
He waves the handkerchief to clearly signal he is no threat
The Germans look at the young soldier making his way over No Man's Land
What's he doing
It's a trap
No,  don't think so
think he's trying to help
The second German cocks his rifle and starts to take aim
Scare him back into his hole
The second German takes a shot aimed over the Geordie's shoulder
89
'
The Geordie crouches for cover, waving his handkerchief more frantically
It's a white flag, ent it
You see the white flag
'm just after tending to this here horse, is all
The Georgie marshals his courage and stands again, waving the handkerchief
Get back, you stupid git
There's no fire from the German trenches
Muttering to himself, the Geordie marches forward towards Joey: The Lord is my shepherd,  shall not want, he leadeth me into green pastures, he lay me down beside the still waters
The Geordie walks very slowly across the mud - there are bodies - the ground squelches beneath his feet
He waves his handkerchief as he walks
He crosses a narrow bridge that spans a flooded bomb crater
Joey, lying on his side, wrapped head to toe in barbed wire, covered in mud, watches Geordie approach
When Geordie gets too close, Joey freaks out and begins thrashing about
Joey whinnies a high scream of pain, because wire is cutting into his hide in several places, and as he thrashes it cuts him deeper
Particularly worrisome is a strand that's wrapped around his head, crossing right over his eye, threatening to slash it
The Geordie calls out in a soothing voice: (') Poor beastie
Poor babbie
It's alright
It's alright
Don't buck and wriggle so, you're only shredding yourself
Joey calms a little, still moving his head up and down
(') You'll blind yourself
He reaches Joey and surveys the formidable tangle of wire in which Joey's bundled
The Geordie soothes and at the same time gingerly tests other strands, trying to figure out where to begin
90
(') Bugger me worthless -  didn't think to bring gloves or something to cut - He stabs his hand on one of the barbs
(') There's a noise behind him, and the Geordie turns around to see the Peter (the German from the trench) standing several feet away, holding some wire cutters
thought perhaps you might need these
He holds out the wire cutters
The Geordie, still frightened, stares stupidly at them
(') For the barbed wire
Yeah, yeah
Ummm, thanks
Cheers
Cheers
He reaches out and takes the proffered cutters
(') Thanks
He returns to Joey, nervous about turning his back
He tries to figure out where to begin cutting
He lifts a long strand of wire that wraps around Joey's neck, stretches across his shoulder and torso and around one of his front legs
He puts the wire in the crux of the cutters and is preparing to snip when Peter steps closer to him
That
That's a very long strand
When you cut it, it's going to release this - He points to a wire wrapped around the wire the Geordie's lifting
Then he points to two other wires, similarly : (') - and this, and this, and they'll coil back rather violently, which 'm afraid will only wound the poor fellow further
91
The Geordie nods
You speak good English
speak English well
(re: the cutters) May
The Geordie hands them over and Peter surveys the wires
(') What if we cut his head free first
So he won't try to stand up and blind himself
And then - Pity you didn't bring a second pair
Then  could cut the wire here - He points to one of the wires entangled with the strand he'd been prepared to cut
Peter stands and shouts in the direction of his trench
All at once one, two, three, six pairs of cutters come soaring through the air and splash into the watery crater
Moments later - Peter and the Geordie kneel beside Joey, each with a pair of cutters
Joey is calming down again
The Geordie positions himself across Joey's body so that when he's cut the wire, it won't coil back and cut Joey
Peter positions himself to be able to cut the two wires in quick succession, holding the first wire to stop it from springing back
Joey's completely still now
Peter points between Joey's eyes
(') His blind spot
The cutters won't frighten him
If you could cut here, holding this wire - He points to wires that intersect the wire that crosses Joey's eye
Then he points to the wire across Joey's eye
92
(') could - Say no more, 'm right behind you
As they reposition themselves, the Geordie says to Joey: (') And you understand what's happening, do you not,  Best Beloved
That you must lay so very nice and still
There's a lad, you're a remarkable horse, you are, helping us help you
There's a lad
There's a remarkable lad
The Geordie looks into Joey's huge eye as he and Peter get to work on their cutting
Joey returns his gaze
(') So how's things in yonder trench
Delightful
We read, we knit sweaters, and we train our rats to perform circus tricks
Well, if ever you need any more rats, we can always send ours over
`Cause we've more than we need, strictly speaking
Besides, they scare off all the pretty girls
Our girls aren't afraid of rats
Big strapping German girls, eh
Kind what gives robust massages
They laugh
Every Thursday
And they bring rum cake on your birthday
Both men smile at this while Joey is completely still; they work quickly, in concert, cutting the horse's head free of the wire
93
Joey raises his head, gives it a shake, neighs and then stirs a little
The two soldiers smile at one another
Then they set about cutting the rest of the wire; it's much easier now
The Geordie cuts through the last wire binding Joey's legs
The two soldiers help as the horse staggers upright
Look at that horse
Look at the muscles he's got, them long legs
They're made for running, horses
Runnin' away from danger
Running away is all they have
Yet we taught `em opposite
Running into the fray
War horse
Yeah
War horse
And there he is
What a strange beast you've become
The Geordie grabs hold of Joey's halter, though Joey shows no sign of running
Joey is finally free
The two men look at each other
And now
take him back with me, yeah
Since  supplied the cutters, the horse is mine
This is fair, no
In a pig's eye
He's English, plain to see
Oh, you mean because he's so filthy
Because he's so smart
And you're none too clean yourself
94
We could box
And the winner gets the horse
The Geordie smiles
No, thanks, pet
Must be careful not to start a war
(patting his pockets:) Do you have a coin of any sort
Coin toss
Yeah
He takes a coin from his pocket, hands it to the Geordie, who looks at it
(') All right, Fritz - you're on
He flips the coin back to Peter
My name is not Fritz - it is Peter
Peter - 'm Colin
You call it, Colin
Heads
Peter spins it in the air and lets it fall into the mud
They look down
Peter shakes his head, resigned
That's the face of my Kaiser and he does not look pleased with me
The horse is yours
They collect their helmets as snow begins to blow around them
Gone quiet, hasn't it
Yes
() () 95
(') But wait half an hour and we'll be shooting again
'm a terrible shot, Pete, don't believe 'll ever hit the target
He hands back the cutters
Thanks
He notices the Geordie has offered his hand, as well beat, then Peter shakes with him
(') Cheerio, mate
( :) You'll take good care of him, yes
will
Our strange beast
And you take care of your own strange self
Peter tosses Geordie his cutters
Colin
pair of German cutters - in memory of your handsome friend from Dusseldorf
Thanks
Peter nods, and walks back to his trench
As he goes, the Geordie calls after him: (') 'll use `em back in the garden in South Shields
You keep your head down, now, Pete me lad
As he walks away, Peter turns back briefly, calling: Remarkable
remarkable horse
The Geordie leads Joey towards the British trenches
96
Joey is now in the trenches, splashing about in the ankle deep water
He seems enormous in this cramped labyrinth
He is led past the broken and wounded soldiers who look at him with amazement, dumbfounded
It is a surreal image
The horse where horses shouldn't be
As Joey makes his journey through the trenches soldiers excitedly gather to watch him come by, taking pleasure in the saving of this single life
We arrive at a section we recognise as the place from where Albert set off only the night before
Sergeant Martin is there - as one man helps a wounded soldier into a medical area
It is David, hobbling and looking shell-shocked
Another wounded soldier approaches, but Martin waves him on
We're full up
Move on
David is seated next to Albert, who now seems in worse condition
His eyes are bandaged and he's wheezing
Andrew is nowhere to be seen
As a   checks Albert:
The gas got him - we had to wait till morning
The medic moves to Sergeant Martin, looking stricken
This can't be all of us
This is all
(bellowing to the men) All walking wounded, away to the dressing station
Away to the dressing station
Joey is led into the hospital area beyond the trenches
The Geordie leads him through the snowy streets
Bandaged men strewn around, wounded soldiers waiting for attention
The waiting soldiers gather to view the strange spectacle of the horse
97
At one of the dressing areas, a  tends to Albert's damaged eyes
Behind him, we see Joey pass in the street, but Albert doesn't know it
Joey limps, his foreleg clearly injured
The Geordie soldier stops outside a makeshift hospital
Joey looks frail and exhausted
storms over from his patients
What's this doing here
We need a vet, sir
There are no vets
We've scarcely any horses left
He's cut all over, but this leg here's got the worst of it
Geordie strokes Joey as the Doctor examines him
It's probably tetanus
It's no good
Please, sir - The Doctor heads back into the hospital, dismissive
've all these men to take care of, corporal, you can see that, can't you
Please, sir, this horse can pull through anything
The doctor absorbs his earnest appeal
Elsewhere, a line of soldiers waiting for medical assistance are curious about what is going on
Blinded by gas, eyes bandaged, one of them turns toward the commotion
It is Albert
What is it
98
It's a horse they found, wandering about in No Man's Land
(easing him back onto a ) Down you go
What kind of an horse
Bloody miraculous kind of an horse, be my guess
Nothing makes it out of No Man's Land
Albert lies there, but can't let go of the thought: Miraculous horse
Joey stands - breathing very deeply
The Doctor touches his wounded leg
The men from all over the medical area gather around Joey concerned about their new hero's pain
The doctor looks at the Geordie and frowns shaking his head "no
" (to the doctor:) He was alive, y'see, sir, where nothing survives, so to me and me mates, to the men, sir, he's - Well, we have high hopes for him - You should shoot him now
The Geordie is broken hearted
Oh, but  can't
It'd be a mercy, lad, that leg's not going to mend
The Doctor sadly addresses a nearby Sergeant
(') Sergeant
Put him out of his misery
99
The doctor nods his head towards Joey
The sergeant, , takes his gun from his holster, checks that it's loaded
He turns to some nearby , urging them away
Ladies, if you please
Total silence from the crowd who have gathered
They thought they were there to see something wonderful
And now they find that they've gathered for an execution - but can't take their eyes off it
The Sergeant waves them back
(') All right, back off
Back off
The Geordie is the last to step away from Joey
The sergeant draws breath - before he steps forward to take aim
Joey is totally still, sensing the atmosphere
The sergeant cocks his pistol
Suddenly there is a strange owl like whistle from fifty yards away
Joey looks around startled
The sergeant turns Joey's head back around, raises his pistol once more
Then, the whistle again
Even the doctor notices this time
Joey turns
Slowly, the crowd parts - another owl whistle - and we see Albert, his eyes bandaged - walking forward blindly - guided by the hands of the crowd
One soldier urges Albert gently
Go on
Do it again
One more whistle
Joey
And this time, Joey trots over to Albert
The horse nuzzles into him
Albert can't see Joey but he touches him
(') (:) Hello, Joey
Hello boy
Where you been then, hey
Where in the world you been
He strokes Joey's mane
Joey responds, becoming very still
The Doctor approaches with the Geordie
100
(to the Geordie:) Do you know this man
The Geordie shakes his head, no
The Doctor speaks to Albert, gently; clearly he thinks he's dealing with a traumatized, possibly crazy soldier
(') What's your name
Albert, realizing he's being addressed, turns to the doctor
Narracott, Private Albert Narracott, sir
This is a random horse, Narracott, and too badly injured
(to the orderly) Is this man in your care
Yes, sir
He's not random at all, sir
He's my horse,  raised him, in Devon
Sir, look at his legs
He's got four white socks, he's brown all over - (points to his own ) - and he has a white mark here - like so
He makes the shape of a diamond with his hands
The doctor turns to the orderly
Take him back
Come on, son
Wait
You can't see `cause of the mud
The Geordie looks around, spots a bucket of water, grabs it and uses a rag to clean Joey's legs, revealing the socks
The Geordie looks at the doctor
101
(') Four white socks
The doctor takes a rag himself and wipes Joey's snout, revealing the white diamond mark
The Sergeant takes this in
and holsters his pistol
All right, break it up
Clear off, the lot of ya
You see, sir
He's not random at all
The doctor steps up to him
We will attend to your horse
Patch him up best we can
Treat him like the soldier he is
Thank you, sir
With one last amazed look at Albert and Joey, the doctor returns to the hospital area
Moments later - Albert, the Geordie, and Sergeant Fry all lead Joey through the snowy street together
Sergeant Fry strides into the middle of the throng of soldiers
Gentlemen
Gentlemen
It falls on me to give you some important news
At eleven o'clock today, in two minutes time - the War will come to an end
Shock from the troops
Strangely muted
Not the explosion of emotion you might have expected
Albert enters, his eyes still red, but no longer bandaged
(') The King and Queen thank you for your service
We have been victorious - even if at a higher price than many of us might have imagined
() 102
(') When the bells ring out - and they will in a moment, for the first time for four years - let us remember our brothers fallen in the field
And thank God for the end of this struggle and victory
And, in the distance, the church bells ring
Joey stands tall, eating some hay, now healed
Complete change of atmosphere
Silence
Tension
Albert stands at attention with Sergeant Fry
severe Major is behind his desk
don't understand, sir
Officers' horses only
All other horses are to be auctioned immediately
That is a complete and bloody outrage
It's the lad's horse, sir, from Devon
He raised him up from a pup, he did
Trained him right up to the day when the army came to town
These aren't my orders, sergeant
( ) You'll have to take him to market
That's all
,
Albert puts on a brave face as he collects Joey and leads him out of the stables in silence
,
As Albert comes out the men have gathered
There's a strange sense of optimism, for such a gloomy moment
The Geordie comes up to Albert and hands him a sheaf of pound notes
We've all clubbed together
It's everything we have
There's twenty-nine pounds there
Buy him back
103
Does the Major know
The Major put in ten
The Geordie flashes a sly wink
(') Mum's the word where the Major's concerned
Your friend on the crutches over there - He turns to indicate David Lyons, who nods at Albert solemnly
(') - even asked the Major to say that Joey was his, an officer's horse, so that he could go back with the others
Albert is amazed
He is about to show his gratitude when the sergeant major shouts: Come on, Narracott
Get a move on
We don't want to miss the show
Albert snaps to attention and begins to lead Joey out of the parade ground with the other horses
As they walk off, the sergeant silently adds some of his own money to the notes in Albert's hand
The intense bustle of the market
Farmers are gathered, bidding for horses
Seven pounds
Seven pounds there
Seven pounds
Eight pounds here
groom leads Joey to the auction pen with other horses
(') Eight pounds
Ten pounds here
Any advance
Sold
Albert waits anxiously, the Geordie lad by his side, as Joey is led into the pen
104
You're alright
Nobody's gonna bid more than fifteen for a thoroughbred
They want work horses
The auctioneer starts the bidding on Joey
Next one
We start at four pounds
Four pounds
The farmers seem disinterested, shaking of heads
The bidding starts
Five pounds, six, seven, now it goes slowly, eight, nine, ten
Albert looks pleased at how it's going
He feels the cash in his hand
It seems to stick on ten, then a new hand comes up at the back of the auction - it is a nasty looking moustached man
Eleven
Sergeant Fry scowls
It's the butcher from Cambrai
He's been bidding for the best all morning
Eleven
Eleven pounds
Eleven pounds
Let me handle this, private
(he calls out) ) Fifteen, and let that be an end to it
He looks daggers at the Butcher
Fifteen pounds
Sixteen
Sixteen pounds
Seventeen
Twenty of your English pounds
And let be the end of it, my friend
105
Twenty pounds
Twenty Five
Twenty five pounds
Twenty Six
Twenty six pounds
The men are all looking very worried
There's not much left
Twenty seven
Twenty eight
Twenty eight pounds
Twenty nine
And thirty
Any advance at thirty pounds
Then, from the back, another, new French voice
One hundred pounds
He steps to the front of the crowd, and suddenly we see who it is
It is Emilie's Grandfather
And sir, if you bid against me,  will sell the coat on my back and bid to one hundred and ten
And if you bid against me again, will sell my farm and bid to a thousand
Everyone looks at Albert who is devastated
Albert is reeling
He hears the auctioneer repeat the final amount and brings down his gavel
106
One hundred pounds
Going, going, gone
The soldiers slowly disperse, leaving Albert to stare at Joey
It really is all over
The Grandfather finishes paying for Joey
Albert and the Geordie stand in front of the grandfather
Sir, 'll give you all your money
Everything you paid when we get back to England
'll give you twice - You don't know anything about him
Oh, but you're wrong, sir,  know everything
Yes, you found him
heard you found a horse in the wire between the armies - No,  found him, he raised him - The Grandfather goes to Joey and takes his reins
When  heard about the miracle horse,  traveled three days because knew whose horse it was
My granddaughter's
She saved his life
He was everything to her
He pauses, briefly, to collect himself
Where is your granddaughter
The war has taken everything from everyone
He is all that  have left of her
The Grandfather leads Joey away
Joey pulls, firmly but not wildly, on the rein the grandfather's holding
The grandfather lets go
107
He watches as Joey walks to Albert and nuzzles him
They have a moment together
The Grandfather watches carefully
Albert puts his face right near Joey - speaks gently
Don't be worried, boy, when  go won't worry over you none
Hey, found you, didn't , and you found me
Grandfather softens and begins to wonder about this soldier
(') And we'll both
we'll both know that we made it through
Now go on
He leads Joey back to the Grandfather
(') We're the lucky ones
Always have been
Lucky since the day  met you
He quietly hands over the reins
(') God be with you, sir
The grandfather looks at Albert, then takes the regimental pennant from his pocket: Do you know what this is
Albert's amazed
It's my father's
It's his regimental pennant
How did you come by this, sir
Grandfather hands Albert the pennant
You may have this
Albert takes the pennant and looks at it, his eyes filling with tears
Thank you ever so much for this, sir
108
(with a sigh) And this
He hands Albert Joey's reins
Albert turns to face him, almost mute with disbelief
He reaches for his money
(') No no, not necessary
He belongs to you
That is, of course, what my little girl would have wanted
And she was the boss
Grandfather laughs, then turns and slowly walks away
What was her name
Emilie
(turns back with a smile) Her name is Emilie
Albert gently embraces Joey
Suddenly, we are back in the village in Devon, in the fold of the valley
Dusk light
figure approaches, silhouetted against the setting sun
Mrs
Naracott gathers the harvest, then notices as the figure makes its way up the road to the farm
man in uniform
On a magnificent horse
Mrs
Narracott meets them at the gate and we can finally see them clearly - Albert and Joey
Albert dismounts and removes his cap
An instant later, Mrs
Narracott is hugging him for all that her life is worth
Ted sees them and makes his way to the field gate
shaky
Albert approaches, and stops a slight distance away
Ted opens the gate to stand before his son
Albert slips something from his pocket and lets it unfurl in his hand - Ted's campaign pennant
Ted accepts it quietly, then offers his hand to Albert
They shake, as men
And then slowly embrace, as father and son
109
Mrs
Narracott joins them as Joey looks on - a small family and a beautiful horse, finally home
