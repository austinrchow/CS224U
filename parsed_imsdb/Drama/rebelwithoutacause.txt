href <b>// --> </b> Rebel Without  Cause by Stewart Stern ' ' :  chic, domineering woman in her sixties who has made her son Frank dependent upon her for every breath he takes
She is the irritant in the household--the silent ruler--the silent enemy of Frank's marriage
' : Frank is an unfeathered man who has never been able to have fun
He is anxious to be a real father to Jim, but has never learned how
' : Tense and immature, she has never found the husband she married
Upset by the presence of her mother-in-law, mated with an ineffectual and joyless man, she takes out her disappointment on him and on her son
: The angry victim and the result
At seventeen he is filled with confusion about his role in life
Because of his "nowhere" father, he does not know how to be a man
Because of his wounding mother, he anticipates destruction in all women
And yet he wants to find a girl who will be willing to receive his tenderness
' ' : a junior partner in a law firm
Boyish, attractive and debonair
Because he is frightened by the adolescence of his daughter, Judy, his only recourse is to criticize her
' : Self-centered and frightened by the coming of middle-age
She feels that Judy's blossoming youth is threatening her wifely position as the desirable object of the husband's attentions
: The victim and the result
At sixteen, she is in a panic of frustration regarding her father--needing his love and suffering when it is denied
This forces her to invite the attention of other men in order to punish him
: Judy's brother
Because he is very young he is a danger to nobody and thus will grow up happily-- certain of the love of his father who feels comfortable in giving it
: Son of a divided family--an absent father and a traveling mother--he feels himself the target of desertion
At fifteen he wants to find a substitute family for himself so that he need no longer feel cold, and especially a friend who will supply the fatherly protection and warmth he needs and cannot find
:  sado-masochistic boy of seventeen, who acts out aggressively his idea of what a man should be in order to hide his real sensitivities and needs
He was probably rejected by both parents and must constantly court danger and must constantly court danger in order to achieve any sense of prestige or personal worth
, , , , , , : All searching for recognition in the only way available to them; all suffering from unfulfilled hungers at home; all creating an outside world of chaos in order to bear the chaos they feel inside
They are soldiers in search of an enemy
deep night sky
Matte shot
Camera searches slowly upward through the heavens and the silver tone of a bell is heard sounding the strokes of midnight
On the final note of the bell, camera is full on the Milky Way and there it rests, just long enough for a burst of Easter singing to arise
The hymn is sung by the crude, unmatched voices of children
Camera pans down to include: Spire of a church
Camera continues its downward pan as the singing continues and we pass a window beyond which is the source of the singing
Camera pans off window to show-- Long shot
City
Night
Suddenly revealed--crisp and sparkling with lights
Camera pans down and over: lonely street full of parked cars
The singing diminishes but a thread of it remains
car has just parked
The headlights snap off
emerges whistling the same melody and pulls some gifts from the front seat
He slams the door and starts down the street in the direction of a house with bright windows
He must pass an empty lot full of rusty grass and litter which lies in darkness between two street lights
As the  walks by the lot, still whistling, a rises silently from the grass, figures who have been lying in concealment until now
They step noiselessly onto the pavement and follow the
At the sound of their boots the whistling stops
The  glances behind him and sees the figures walking after him, filling the pavement
street light shows them to be boys and girls and all quite young
The  moves on more swiftly and the sound of their pursuit increases
He begins to run toward the lighted house and the following steps run too
Suddenly he stops under the next street light and turns to face the figures
They are upon him and around him quickly
Nobody speaks for a moment, then one of the boys grins
His name is
He is big and filled with an awareness of his own masculinity
(friendly, cool) That was pretty what you were whistling
Whistle some more
The  whistles a nervous phrase, trying to make a joke of the situation which he doesn't understand
(continuing; suddenly) You got a cigarette
Oh,  think so-- The  fumbles in his pocket, finds a pack and drops it in his nervousness
The  wait until he picks it up
He offers one to
(continuing) Filter tips
(smiling, encouraging) You smoke it
Smoke it, Dad
Smiling uncertainly, the  puts the cigarette in his mouth
, still smiling, takes out a packet of wooden matches
(continuing) 'll light it for you, Dad
ignites a match and holds it near the Man's face for a second, searching it
Then he ignites the whole box under his nose
The  shrieks, and his packages fall slaps him sharply, his smile gone
The camera pans away as the figures enclose him, and holds on a small mechanical monkey which has dropped from its wrappings
It begins to dance madly on the pavement, then runs down
The feet of the figures scatter past the unmoving monkey
Then camera rises to show that the man has disappeared
There is a moment of awful stillness, then we see a boy coming down the street alone
He is quite drunk, and he slips once
This is , a good-looking kid of seventeen with a crew-cut and wearing a good suit
The spilled packages on the pavement stop him
He bends down to see what they are and picks up the mechanical monkey from the wreckage
He smiles and winds it up
He sets it on the sidewalk and sits down
He watches it dance for a moment, happily
siren is heard distantly, growing louder pays no attention to it as he winds the monkey again and releases it for its dance
: "   "  ____ as siren rises piercingly close, and  looks up, we: : Close shot
Throbbing light of police car
Night
The siren screaming wildly, then dying
The sound of brakes
Camera moves to reveal the police car stopped at the entrance of a Precinct Station
Two officers dismount, bearing between them the struggling
They bear him up the steps and in through the double doors
Inside precinct station
Reception area
large open space onto which several corridors converge
In the middle is a Sergeant's desk, really a quadrangular counter in the center of which the  stands
There are a few glass-walked interviewing rooms which open off the area, and several benches lining the walls
The scene is one of confusion, activity and waiting
Phones ring
The arrested pass in custody of officers
Present among others at 's entrance are: , who is blonde and sixteen
She sits on a crowded bench wearing an expression of downcast bitterness
On a bench across the way from her are three remarkably dirty little Mexican children without shoes or socks
The oldest is a  of four who is protecting his little  who in turn mothers an infant crying on the bench beside her
Standing at a corner of the desk is a docile, undersized boy of fifteen named  ""
He is shivering
With him is a large  , his maid

One of the officers presents a brief report to the , who examines it
Mixed up in that beating on Twelfth Street
No
Plain drunkenness

They had him on the carpet for an hour at Headquarters
He's clear
Plain drunkenness

The officer leads  to 's bench and stands him against the wall beside it

The finds the toy monkey in his pocket and would take it, but when  asks to keep it, the  hands it back and moves away
Another officer enters and leads the prisoner who is sitting next to  into another room sits beside her
He smiles at her but receives only a chilling look
He winds the monkey up and sets it dancing on the floor, but she is not amused
Camera pans to show others reacting to the monkey with pleasure
We see look up and smile a little
Camera stops on the who are smiling too
bald   named , squats before them, smiling
You going to tell me your name now
The little boy shakes his head
(touching 's bald pate) Where's your hair
It's all gone
Did you get a haircut

His name is

He looks down at her, consults the file in his hand

Inside small office as  comes in,  following
He indicates a chair for her while he sits down behind a desk
(continuing) He doesn't like anything about me-- he calls me--he calls me-- She starts to cry
She doesn't hide it, but keeps wiping the tears with the palms of her hands
He makes you feel pretty unhappy
(crying) He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father
Do you think your father means that
Yes

We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill
Big deal
So put on my new dress and  came out and he-- That one
Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming
He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till thought  wouldn't have any lips left
And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing  told you he called me
Then  ran out of the house
Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning

tried to call the kids but everybody was out and  couldn't find them hate my life
just hate it
You weren't looking for company, were you
No
Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy
(she is silent) Do you enjoy that
No
don't even know why  do it
Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way
mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention
Did you ever think of that
'll never get close to anybody
Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy
You know where they picked me up
Twelfth Street

Would you like to go home if we can arrange it

She wouldn't give me their number
What's your number, Judy
We'll see if your Dad will come and get you
looks up hopefully
Unless you really don't want to go home

suspects this is something more than mere disinterest, so lets the humming go on, in order to discover its real purpose
watches everything like a tennis match, reacting with soft little sounds of terror or astonishment or sympathy
No one pays any attention to her
For a moment no one talks watches  as he hums
Then the  shakes his head and looks up

You don't
No

Then what is it

Why'd you get drunk
You must have had a reason

Was it because we went to that party

He said a little drink
(exploding) You're tearing me apart

Big tough character

You feel like you want to blow your wheels right now
All the time

That why you moved from the last town
'Cause you were in trouble
You can talk about it if you want to-- know about it anyway
Routine check
And they think they are protecting my by moving
You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there
Why did you do it
Mess that kid up

(continuing) He called me chicken
And your folks didn't understand
They never do
So then you moved
They think 'll make friends if we move
Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine
But you don't think that's a solution
is silent; he picks at his nails
(continuing) Things pretty tough for you at home
She eats him alive and he takes it
stares at his family through hole in door
What a zoo
What

He always wants to be my pal, you know
But how can  give him anything when he's-- mean love him and  don't want to hurt him--but  don't know what to do anymore except maybe die
Pretty mixed up
If he could-- "If he could" what
You mean your father
mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once  bet she'd be happy and  bet she'd stop picking
They make mush out of him
Just mush
One thing  know is  never want to be like him
(interrupts) Chicken

shrugs
How can anyone grow up in this circus
You got me, Jim--but they do
Want some water
(as  gets a cup of water from cooler) Boy--if  had one day when  didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or  felt  belonged some place
(giving him water) Here
Look, will you do something for me
If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam
Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze
It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks
Okay-- Any time--day or night
You calmed down enough to go back now
(smiling) You serious
smiles and opens the door
's office as  comes towards his  and forces himself to kiss her
'm sorry
All right, darling
She rises and takes his arm
They start out through the door into the hall, followed by  and
(to ) This was all very unfortunate, but he made a mistake and he's sorry-- so we're not going to have any more trouble
He's always been a lovely boy-- Lovely
Grandma--if you tell another lie you're going to turn to stone
Luck, Jim
Don't forget
(offering  three cigars) Have some cigars
No thanks,  don't smoke
Go on--Give 'em to your friends
No--thanks, very much, Mr

They all leave

This is not our sky
It is a replica of it projected onto the dome of the Planetarium
The stars slide their tentative ways in an ever-changing pattern
One of them is much larger than the rest and increases in size as we watch
Music of the spheres is heard--a high threatening tremolo
(
) For many days before the end of our earth people will look into the night sky and notice a star, increasingly bright and increasingly near
looks around for a seat and passes down aisle
Seen beyond him is the projector, moving slowly, its great dumb- bell head sparkling with pin-points of light
takes a seat in front row
, in the row behind him, moves over a seat to be nearer
They exchange looks

The great polar fields of the north and south will rot and divide, and the seas will turn warmer

Music is up loud
Full shot
The dome seen past 's head
The heavens grow brighter as the star plummets near
Music at crescendo

The sky is blasted by a wild flash of light
Music reaches explosion
The stars appear again

Faces of normal kids watching seriously--very impressed

And Man, existing alone, seems to be an episode of little consequences

Thank you very much

Three doors open onto it: one is closed--this is 's room:--another, leading into 's room is open, but the room beyond is dark: the third, also open, reveals the bedroom of 's parents

Inside 's living room
The television is on, but only a hum comes from it, and the screen is a flickering gray
The sits lumpily in a chair by the fireplace, still dressed but with his collar open
The sound of 's step in the dining room makes him open his eyes
Fear of facing his son makes him shut them again
The boy comes in, a bottle of milk in his hand
Seeing his  there, he stops short--his impulse is to flee
Instead he comes in and looks down at the sleeping man whose eyelids, fluttering in the 's masquerade of sleep, make him seem to be having a dream
is torn between his desire to leave and his need to speak
He turns off the television quietly, then lies down on the couch across the way
He mumbles the things he would say to his  and the answers he feels he would get
The old man opens his eyes once, sees the boy there, head banging upside down from the couch
Then he shuts them again

What happened, darling
We were so worried
was going to take a sleeping pill, but  wouldn't till knew you were home
have to talk to someone, Mom have to talk to you both
And Dad this time you got to give me an answer
Go ahead
'm in terrible trouble
--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction
Sure--there was a bad accident there
They showed the pictures on was in it
How
It doesn't matter how
was driving a stolen car-- Do you enjoy doing this to me or what-- Mom--'m not-- And you wanted him to make a list
Will you let him tell it
She never wants to hear
She doesn't care
guess when  nearly died giving birth to you--that shows how much don't care
Just relax, please relax
told you Dad, it was a question of honor
They called me chicken-- you know, chicken
had to go or would never have been able to face any of those kids again
So got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other
We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff
got out okay but Buzz didn't
He was killed
Good Lord
can't keep it to myself anymore-- Well, just get it off your chest, son
That's not what  mean
've never done anything right
've been going around with my head in a sling for years
don't want to drag you into this but  can't help it
don't think  can prove anything by going around pretending 'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another
You're absolutely right
Are you listening to me
You're involved in this
want to go to the police and tell them  was mixed up in this thing tonight
You what
No
Did anyone see you there
mean did they get your license number or anything
don't think so-- Well-- What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police
What's that got to do with it
Why should you be the only one
Look Jim
Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's-- Are you going to preach now
Are we going to have a sermon
'm just explaining what you mean
You can't be an idealist all your life
Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out
That's right
Except yourself
Will you wait a minute
You don't want me to go
No
don't want you to go to the police
There were other people and why should you be the only one involved
But  am involved
We're all involved, Mom
boy was killed
don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen
You know you did wrong
That's the main thing, isn't it
No
It's nothing
Just nothing
You always told me to tell the truth
You think you can just turn that off
He's not saying that
He's saying don't volunteer
Just tell a little white lie
You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim
don't want to learn that
Well, it doesn't matter anyhow-- because we're moving
No
You're not tearing me loose any more
Do  have to spell it out
You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom
Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse
Now  want to do one thing right and 'm not letting you run away
(silence) Dad
Son--this is all happening so fast-- You better give me something, Dad
You better give me something (stops as he sees the emptiness in them) Mom
Jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life
Dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me
The  is mute, helpless
Suddenly  screams
Dad
He leaps at his , dragging him to his feet, hands at the man's throat
Stop it
You'll kill him
Jim
Do you want to kill your father
Suddenly  loosens his hands and rises
He looks swiftly at each of them--moves a few steps toward the door, looks back at them again--then rushes out of the house
The parents stand frozen

His wonderment is justified
The floor of the arcade is marble and there are marble benches and neo-Roman busts lining the walls

Oh, Jim
No--come on
Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear

Remember our budget

Well--we're newlyweds
There's just one thing
What about-- Children
Well, we really don't encourage them
They're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree
Yes
And so terribly annoying when they cry

Of course
Drown them like puppies
See, we're very modern
Shall  show you the nursery
It's far away from the rest of the house
If you have children--Oh  hate the word
--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice
In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them
Talk to them
Heavens
Nobody talks to children
They just tell them one thing and mean another
It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too
You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery

There's only one key

Framing the pool is a flagstone walk with marble benches spotted here and there
The great glass room had once been planted thickly with tropical foliage
But now what palms and lianas remain are withered and dead with lack of care
At the edge of the pool, near the deep end, a blanket has been spread and a candelabra burns upon it
In its mysterious light our three kids are revealed: , bouncing precariously at the end of the diving board; on the blanket nearby;  on the pool's bottom

When was that
When  was here
When  ran away
used to run away a lot but they always took me back
Who
Mom and Dad
used to be in my crib and 'd listen to them fight
You remember that far back
Boy, can't even remember yesterday
Plato, where's your father now
He's dead
He was a hero in the China Sea
You told me he's a big wheel in New York

Well, he might as well be dead
What's the difference
It's all right
Sure
closes his eyes
hums a lullaby as she strokes 's lips with a finger
He snaps at it
Then he kisses her hand, looks at her palm
They whisper
(continuing) You have a long life-line
She takes his palm and examines it
So have you
She kisses it, holds her cheek against it
Ever been in a place like this before
Not exactly
It's certainly huge
How many rooms do you think there are
don't know
Should we explore
She looks at
shrugs--tests to see if the boy is awake, but there is no reaction
Carefully, they crawl to their feet
supporting 's head with his hands as they do so
takes the other blanket and covers  with it
kneels on the other side and tucks it in
They look at each other across him and smile
Then suddenly  bends down and kisses 's cheek very softly
and  rise
takes a candle from the candelabra and leads  along the edge of the pool to the glass doors beyond
Silence except for their footfalls on the flagstone
In the distance we see the doors open and the couple pass through
When they close again, a sob comes from
High angle closeup
lying as they left him, but his eyes are open and he is crying
Camera booms up as throws off the blanket and looks after them
Camera booms higher until he is revealed as a small and lonely figure sitting by himself
The pool echoes his weeping
: Inside library
Mansion
Night
The door opens slowly and appears with the candle
lingers at the door
The flickering light reveals a formerly lavish room, paneled in oak
There is a tapestry couch, empty bookcases, some dim portraits, a leather table and several chairs around a great stone fireplace
Hey
Will you look at this room
(looks behind him) Judy
She comes forward
drips wax on the table-top and sticks the candle on it
His hand shakes
sits on the couch
(continuing) Want to read any books
Take your pick
(sits beside her) Isn't this the craziest
Hi
Hi
He takes her hand
She looks at him and smiles
(continuing) What
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky
(kisses it) You're so funny
Why
don't know--you just are
Leaving a light for Plato
That was nice
Maybe he's scared of the dark
Are you
snuffs out the candle
They are left in moonlight pause
(singing) Here we are-- out of cigarettes-- Junior's in the nurs'ry-- See how late it gets-- You don't need to do that
There's something  should tell you, Judy
know already
We don't have to pretend now
(laughing) What a relief
He leans back, relaxed at last
She snuggles close to him
Is this what it's like to love somebody
You disappointed
(mussing her hair) Funny Jimmy
You're so clean and you--this is silly
What
You smell like baby powder
So do you
never felt so clean before
It's not going to be lonely, Judy
Not for you and not for me
love somebody
All the time 've been looking for someone to love me and now-- love somebody
And it's so easy
Why is it easy now
It is for me too

She kisses his lips gently and looks into his face
He returns the kiss
Their arms go around each other

He feints this way and that, the boys responding as if they were fencing
swings down the ladder and his boots make a loud report as they hit the pool
advances down the steps at the shallow end
climbs onto the pool bottom at the opposite side
The feinting continues, wordlessly, as the circle closes around
The only sounds are the stamping of their boots as they try to distract him from side to side, and the animalistic grunts they make to scare him
Suddenly  sees an opening and plunges past , pushing him over, and stumbles up the steps
Come on
Let's make it
