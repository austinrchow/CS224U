The door bursts open
and  enter, drunk and giggling, horny as hell
No sooner is the door shut than they're all over each other, ripping at clothes, pawing at flesh, mouths locked together
He gropes for a lamp, tries to turn it on, knocks it over instead
Hell with it
He's got more urgent things to do, like getting her blouse open and his hands on her breasts
She arches, moaning, fumbling with his fly
He slams her against the wall, ripping her skirt
We hear fabric tear
He enters her right then and there, roughly, up against the wall
She cries out, hitting her head against the wall but not caring, grinding against him, clawing his back, shivering with the sensations running through her
He carries her across the room with her legs wrapped around him
They fall onto the bed
, exiting through the window, traveling smoothly outside
2	 --  --  (1946) 2 to reveal the bungalow, remote in a wooded area, the lovers' cries spilling into the night
and we drift down a wooded path, the sounds of rutting passion growing fainter, mingling now with the night sounds of crickets and hoot owls
and we begin to hear   in the woods, tinny and incongruous, and still we keep   until
a car is revealed
1946 Plymouth
Parked in a clearing
3	 --  --  (1946) 3 , mid-20's, wire rim glasses, three-piece suit
Under normal circumstances a respectable, solid citizen; hardly dangerous, perhaps even meek
But these circumstances are far from normal
He is disheveled, unshaven, and very drunk cigarette smolders in his mouth
His eyes, flinty and hard, are riveted to the bungalow up the path
He can hear them fucking from here
He raises a bottle of bourbon and knocks it back
The radio plays softly, painfully romantic, taunting him: You stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful
To be what you seem
He opens the glove compartment, pulls out an object wrapped in a rag
He lays it in his lap and unwraps it carefully -- -- revealing a
38 revolver
Oily, black, evil
He grabs a box of bullets
Spills them everywhere, all over the seats and floor
Clumsy
He picks bullets off his lap, loading them into the gun, one by one, methodical and grim
Six in the chamber
His gaze goes back to the bungalow
He shuts off the radio
Abrupt silence, except for the distant lovers' moans
He takes another shot of bourbon courage, then opens the door and steps from the car
4	 --  --  (1946) 4 His wingtip shoes crunch on gravel
Loose bullets scatter to the ground
The bourbon bottle drops and shatters
He starts up the path, unsteady on his feet
The closer he gets, the louder the lovemaking becomes
Louder and more frenzied
The lovers are reaching a climax, their sounds of passion degenerating into rhythmic gasps and grunts
(
) Oh god
oh god
oh god
Andy lurches to a stop, listening
The woman cries out in orgasm
The sound slams into Andy's brain like an icepick
He shuts his eyes tightly, wishing the sound would stop
It finally does, dying away like a siren until all that's left is the shallow gasping and panting of post-coitus
We hear languorous laughter, moans of satisfaction
(
) Oh god
that's sooo good
you're the best
the best  ever had
Andy just stands and listens, devastated
He doesn't look like much of a killer now; he's just a sad little man on a dirt path in the woods, tears streaming down his face, a loaded gun held loosely at his side
pathetic figure, really
: 1ST 5	 --  --  (1946) 5 listens like a gallery of mannequins on display, pale-faced and stupefied
(
) Mr
Dufresne, describe the confrontation you had with your wife the night she was murdered
is on the witness stand, hands folded, suit and tie pressed, hair meticulously combed
He speaks in soft, measured tones: It was very bitter
She said she was glad  knew, that she hated all the sneaking around
She said she wanted a divorce in Reno
What was your response
told her  would not grant one
(refers to his notes) 'll see you in Hell before  see you in Reno
Those were the words you used, Mr
Dufresne, according to the testimony of your neighbors
If they say so
really don't remember
was upset
: 2ND What happened after you and your wife argued
She packed a bag and went to stay with Mr
Quentin
Glenn Quentin
The golf pro at the Falmouth Hills Country Club
The man you had recently discovered was her lover
(Andy nods) Did you follow her
went to a few bars first
Later, decided to drive to Mr
Quentin's home and confront them
They weren't there
so  parked my car in the turnout
and waited
With what intention
'm not sure
was confused
Drunk
think mostly  wanted to scare them
You had a gun with you
Yes
did
: 3RD When they arrived, you went up to the house and murdered them
No
was sobering up
realized she wasn't worth it
decided to let her have her quickie divorce
Quickie divorce indeed
38 caliber divorce, wrapped in a handtowel to muffle the shots, isn't that what you mean
And then you shot her lover
did not
got back in the car and drove home to sleep it off
Along the way,  stopped and threw my gun into the Royal River
feel 've been very clear on this point
Yes, you have
Where  get hazy, though, is the part where the cleaning woman shows up the next morning and finds your wife and her lover in bed, riddled with
38 caliber bullets
Does that strike you as a fantastic coincidence, Mr
Dufresne, or is it just me
(softly) Yes
It does
'm sorry, Mr
Dufresne,  don't think the jury heard that
Yes
It does
Does what
Strike me as a fantastic coincidence
On that, sir, we are in accord
4TH You claim you threw your gun into the Royal River before the murders took place
That's rather convenient
It's the truth
You recall Lt
Mincher's testimony
He and his men dragged that river for three days and nary a gun was found
So no comparison can be made between your gun and the bullets taken from the bloodstained corpses of the victims
That's also rather convenient, isn't it, Mr
Dufresne
(faint, bitter smile) Since  am innocent of this crime, sir,  find it decidedly inconvenient the gun was never found
: 6	 --  --  (1946) 6 The
holds the jury spellbound with his closing summation: Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard all the evidence, you know all the facts
We have the accused at the scene of the crime
We have foot prints
Tire tracks
Bullets scattered on the ground which bear his fingerprints
broken bourbon bottle, likewise with fingerprints
Most of all, we have a beautiful young woman and her lover lying dead in each other's arms
They had sinned
But was their crime so great as to merit a death sentence
He gestures to Andy sitting quietly with his
suspect Mr
Dufresne's answer to that would be yes
further suspect he carried out that sentence on the night of September 21st, this year of our Lord, 1946, by pumping four bullets into his wife and another four into Glenn Quentin
And while you think about that, think about this
He picks up a revolver, spins the cylinder before their eyes like a carnival barker spinning a wheel of fortune
revolver holds six bullets, not eight
submit to you this was not a hot-blooded crime of passion
That could at least be understood, if not condoned
No, this was revenge of a much more brutal and cold-blooded nature
Consider
Four bullets per victim
Not six shots fired, but eight
That means he fired the gun empty
and then stopped to reload so he could shoot each of them again
An extra bullet per lover
right in the head
(a few  shiver) 'm done talking
You people are all decent, God-fearing Christian folk
You know what to do
: 6TH 7	 --   --  (1946) 7 down a long table, moving from one  to the next
These decent, God-fearing Christians are chowing down on a nice fried chicken dinner provided them by the county, smacking greasy lips and gnawing cobbettes of corn
(
) Guilty
Guilty
Guilty
Guilty
We find the  at the head of the table, sorting votes
: 7TH 8	 --  --  (1946) 8 Andy stands before the dias
peers down, framed by a carved frieze of blind Lady Justice on the wall
You strike me as a particularly icy and remorseless man, Mr
Dufresne
It chills my blood just to look at you
By the power vested in me by the State of Maine,  hereby order you to serve two life sentences, back to back, one for each of your victims
So be it
He raps his gavel as we :
9 	 -  9 slides open with an enormous
stark room waits beyond
through
sit side by side at a long table
An empty chair faces them
We are now in: --    --  (1947) enters, removes his cap and waits by the chair
#1 Sit
Red sits, tries not to slouch
The chair is uncomfortable
#2 We see by your file you've served twenty years of a life sentence
#3 You feel you've been rehabilitated
Yes, sir
Absolutely
've learned my lesson
can honestly say 'm a changed man
'm no longer a danger to society
That's the God's honest truth
No doubt about it
The men just stare at him
One stifles a yawn
-- big rubber stamp slams down: "" in red ink
10	 --   --   --  (1947) 10 High stone walls topped with snaky concertina wire, set off at intervals by looming guard towers
Over a hundred  are in the yard
Playing catch, shooting craps, jawing at each other, making deals
Exercise period
emerges into fading daylight, slouches low-key through the activity, worn cap on his head, exchanging hellos and doing minor business
He's an important man here
(
) There's a con like me in every prison in America,  guess
'm the guy who can get it for you
Cigarettes, a bag of reefer if you're partial, a bottle of brandy to celebrate your kid's high school graduation
Damn near anything, within reason
He slips somebody a pack of smokes, smooth sleight-of-hand
(
) Yes sir, 'm a regular Sears & Roebuck
issue from the main tower, drawing everybody's attention to the loading dock
The outer gate swings open
revealing a gray prison bus outside
(
) So when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949 and asked me to smuggle Rita Hayworth into the prison for him, told him no problem
And it wasn't
Fresh fish
Fresh fish today
Red is joined by , , , , ,
Most cons crowd to the fence to gawk and jeer, but Red and his group mount the bleachers and settle in comfortably
11	 --   --  (1947) 11 Andy sits in back, wearing steel collar and chains
(
) Andy came to Shawshank Prison in early 1947 for murdering his wife and the fella she was bangin'
The bus lurches forward,  through the gates
Andy gazes around, swallowed by prison walls
(
) On the outside, he'd been vice- president of a large Portland bank
Good work for a man as young as he was, when you consider how conservative banks were back then
All clear
approach the bus with carbines
The door jerks open
The new fish disembark, chained together single-file, blinking sourly at their surroundings
Andy stumbles against the  in front of him, almost drags him down
, captain of the guard, slams his baton into Andy's back
Andy goes to his knees, gasping in pain and  from the spectators
On your feet before  fuck you up so bad you never walk again
13 	   13 There they are, boys
The Human Charm Bracelet
Never seen such a sorry-lookin' heap of maggot shit in my life
Comin' from you, Heywood, you being so pretty and all
Takin' bets today, Red
(pulls notepad and pencil) Bear Catholic
Pope shit in the woods
Smokes or coin, bettor's choice
Smokes
Put me down for two
High roller
Who's your horse
That gangly sack of shit, third from the front
He'll be the first
Bullshit
'll take that action
Me too
Other hands go up
Red jots the names
You're out some smokes, son
Take my word
You're so smart, you call it
say that chubby fat-ass
let's see
fifth from the front
Put me down for a quarter deck
That's five cigarettes on Fat-Ass
Any takers
More hands go up
Andy and the others are paraded along, forced by their chains to take tiny baby steps, flinching under the barrage of jeers and shouts
The old-timers are shaking the fence, trying to make the newcomers shit their pants
Some of the new fish shout back, but mostly they look terrified
Especially Andy
(
) must admit  didn't think much of Andy first time  laid eyes on him
He might'a been important on the outside, but in here he was just a little turd in prison grays
Looked like a stiff breeze could blow him over
That was my first impression of the man
What say, Red
Little fella on the end
Definitely
stake half a pack
Any takers
Rich bet
'mon, boys, who's gonna prove me wrong
(hands go up) Floyd, Skeet, Joe, Heywood
Four brave souls, ten smokes apiece
That's it, gentlemen, this window's closed
Red pockets his notepad
comes over the
speakers: (amplified) Return to your cellblocks for evening count
14	 --   --  (1947) 14 The new fish are marched in
Guards unlock the shackles
The chains drop away, rattling to the stone floor
Eyes front
strolls forth, a colorless man in a gray suit and a church pin in his lapel
He looks like he could piss ice water
He appraises the newcomers with flinty eyes
This is Mr
Hadley, captain of the guard
am Mr
Norton, the warden
You are sinners and scum, that's why they sent you to me
Rule number one: no blaspheming
'll not have the Lord's name taken in vain in my prison
The other rules you'll figure out as you go along
Any questions
When do we eat
Cued by Norton's glance, Hadley steps up to the con and screams right in his face: - Hadley rams the tip of his club into the con's belly
The man falls to his knees, gasping and clutching himself
Hadley takes his place at Norton's side again
Softly: Any other questions
(there are none) believe in two things
Discipline and the Bible
Here, you'll receive both
(holds up a Bible) Put your faith in the Lord
Your ass belongs to me
Welcome to Shawshank
Off with them clothes
And  didn't say take all day doing it, did
The men shed their clothes
Within seconds, all stand naked
First man into the shower
Hadley shoves the   into a steel cage open at the front
open up with a fire hose
The con is slammed against the back of the cage, sputtering and hollering
Seconds later, the water is cut and the con yanked out
Delouse that piece of shit
Next man in
The con gets a huge scoop of white delousing powder thrown all over him
Gasping and coughing, blinking powder from his eyes, he gets shoved to a trustee's cage
The  slides a short stack of items through the slot -- prison clothes and a Bible
All the men are processed quickly -- a blast of water, powder, clothes and a Bible
15	 --  --  (1947) 15 naked  steps before a  and gets a cursory exam
penlight is shined in his eyes, ears, nose, and throat
Bend over
The con does
with a penlight in his teeth spreads his cheeks, peers up his ass, and nods
Andy is next up
He gets the same treatment
16	 --   --  (1947) 16 the naked newcomers shivering on hard wooden chairs, clothes on their laps, Bibles open
(
) maketh me to lie down in green pastures
He leadeth me beside the still waters
He restoreth my soul
17	 --   --  (1947) 17 Three tiers to a side, concrete and steel, gray and imposing
Andy and the others are marched in, still naked, carrying their clothes and Bibles
The  in their cells greet them with , , and
One by one, the new men are shown to their cells and locked in with a
(
) The first night's the toughest, no doubt about it
They march you in naked as the day you're born, fresh from a Bible reading, skin burning and half-blind from that delousing shit they throw on you
Red watches from his cell, arms slung over the crossbars, cigarette dangling from his fingers
(
) and when they put you in that cell, when those bars slam home, that's when you know it's for real
Old life blown away in the blink of an eye
a long cold season in hell stretching out ahead
nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it
Red listens to the  below
He watches Andy and a few others being brought up to the 2nd tier
(
) Most new fish come close to madness the first night
Somebody always breaks down crying
Happens every time
The only question is, who's it gonna be
Andy is led past and given a cell at the end of the tier
(
) It's as good a thing to bet on as any,  guess
had my money on Andy Dufresne
18	 -- '  --  (1947) 18 The bars slam home
Andy is alone in his cell, clutching his clothes
He gazes around at his new surroundings, taking it in
He slowly begins to dress himself
19	 --   --  (1947) 19 malignant stone growth on the Maine landscape
The moon hangs low and baleful in a dead sky
The headlight of a cuts through the night
20	 -- '  --  (1947) 20 Red lies on his bunk below us, tossing his baseball toward the ceiling and catching it again
He pauses, listening approach below, unhurried, echoing hollowly on stone
21	 --   --  (1947) 21 strolls into frame
That's lights out
Good night, ladies
The lights bump off in sequence
The guard exits, footsteps echoing away
Darkness now
Silence
the tiers toward Red's cell
(
) remember my first night
Seems a long time ago now
Red looms from the darkness, leans on the bars
Listens
Waits
From somewhere below comes faint, ghastly tittering
drift through the cellblock, taunting: (
) Fishee fishee fisheeee
You're gonna like it here, new fish whooole lot
Make you wish your daddies never dicked your mommies
You takin' this down, new fish
Gonna be a quiz later
(somebody ) Sshhh
Keep it down
The screws'll hear
Fishee fishee fisheeee
(
) The boys always go fishin' with first-timers
and they don't quit till they reel someone in
The  keep on, sly and creepy in the dark
22	 --   --  (1947) 22 thru thru 25 2g
while the new cons go quietly crazy in their cells
One man paces like a caged animal
another sits gnawing his cuticles bloody
a third is weeping silently
a fourth is dry-heaving into the toilet
26	 -- '  --  (1947) 26 Red waits at the bars
Smoking
Listening
He cranes his head, peers down toward Andy's cell
Nothing
Not a peep
(
) Fat-Ass
oh, Faaaat-Ass
Talk to me, boy
know you're in there can hear you breathin'
Now don't you listen to these nitwits, hear
27	 -- -'  --  (1947) 27 Fat-Ass is crying, trying not to hyperventilate
(
) This ain't such a bad place
'll introduce you around, make you feel right at home
know some big ol' bull queers who'd love to make your acquaintance
especially that big white mushy butt of yours
And that's it
Fat-Ass lets out a   of despair: - ' 28	 -- '  --  (1947) 28 ' -
' 29	 --  --  (1947) 29 The place goes nuts
Fat-Ass throws himself screaming against the bars
The entire block starts : Fresh fish
fresh fish
fresh fish
fresh fish
- ' (
) had your mother
She wasn't that great
The lights bump on
pour in, led by Hadley himself
What the Christ is this happy shit
(
) He took the Lord's name in vain
'm tellin' the warden
(to the unseen wit) You'll be tellin' him with my baton up your ass
Hadley arrives at Fat-Ass' cell, bellowing through the bars: What's your malfunction you fat fuckin' barrel of monkey-spunk
- '
' ain't gonna count to three
Not even to one
Now shut the fuck up 'fore  sing you a lullabye
Fat-Ass keeps blubbering and wailing
Total freak-out
Hadley draws his baton, gestures to his men
Open it
unlocks the cell
Hadley pulls Fat-Ass out and starts beating him with the baton, brutally raining blows
Fat-Ass falls, tries to crawl
The place goes dead silent
All we hear now is the dull -- of the baton
Fat-ass passes out
Hadley gets in a few more licks and finally stops
Get this tub of shit down to the infirmary
(peers around) If  hear so much as a mouse fart in here the rest of the night, by God and Sonny Jesus, you'll all visit the infirmary
Every last motherfucker here
The guards wrestle Fat-Ass onto a stretcher and carry him off
echo away
Lights off
Darkness again
Silence
30	 -- '  --  (1947) 30 Red stares through the bars at the main floor below, eyes riveted to the small puddle of blood where Fat-Ass went down
(
) His first night in the joint, Andy Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes
He never made a sound
31	 --   --  (1947) 31 The master locks are thrown -- -
The cons step from their cells, lining the tiers
The  holler their head-counts to the  , who jots on a clipboard
Red peers at Andy, checking him out
Andy stands in line, collar buttoned, hair combed
32	 --   --  (1947) 32 Andy goes through the breakfast line, gets a scoop of glop on his tray
through the noise and confusion
and discover   and  MacBRIDE watching Andy go by
Bogs sizes Andy up with a salacious gleam in his eye, mutters something to Rooster
Rooster laughs
Andy finds a table occupied by Red and his regulars, chooses a spot at the end where nobody is sitting
Ignoring their stares, he picks up his spoon -- and pauses, seeing something in his food
He carefully fishes it out with his fingers
It's a squirming maggot
Andy grimaces, unsure what to do with it
is sitting closest to Andy
At age 65, he's a senior citizen, a long-standing resident
You gonna eat that
Hadn't planned on it
You mind
Andy passes the maggot to Brooks
Brooks examines it, rolling it between his fingertips like a man checking out a fine cigar
Andy is riveted with apprehension
Mmm
Nice and ripe
Andy can't bear to watch
Brooks opens up his sweater and feeds the maggot to a baby crow nestled in an inside pocket
Andy breathes a sigh of relief
Jake says thanks
Fell out of his nest over by the plate shop
'm lookin' after him till he's old enough to fly
Andy nods, proceeds to eat
Carefully
Heywood approaches
Oh, Christ, here he comes
Mornin', boys
It's a fine mornin'
You know why it's fine
Heywood plops his tray down, sits
The men start pulling out cigarettes and handing them down
That's right, send 'em all down wanna see 'em lined up in a row, pretty as a chorus line
An impressive pile forms
Heywood bends down and inhales deeply, smelling the aroma
Rapture
Smell my ass
Gee, Red
Terrible shame, your horse comin' in last and all
Hell,  sure do love that horse of mine
believe  owe that boy a big sloppy kiss when  see him
Give him some'a your cigarettes instead, cheap bastard
Say Tyrell, you pull infirmary duty this week
How's that winnin' horse of mine, anyway
Dead
(the men fall silent) Hadley busted his head pretty good
Doc already went home for the night
Poor bastard lay there till this morning
By then
He shakes his head, turns back to his food
The silence mounts
Heywood glances around
Men resume eating
Softly: What was his name
What
What'd you say
was wondering if anyone knew his name
What the fuck you care, new fish
(resumes eating) Doesn't matter what his fuckin' name was
He's dead
33	 --   --  (1947) 33 of industrial washers and presses
Andy works the laundry line
nightmarish job
He's new at it
, the con foreman, elbows him aside and shows him how it's done
34	 --  --  (1947) 34 Shower heads mounted in bare concrete
Andy showers with a dozen or more men
No modesty here
At least the water is good and hot, soothing his tortured muscles
Bogs looms from the billowing steam, smiling, checking Andy up and down
Rooster and  appear from the sides
The Sisters
You're some sweet punk
You been broke in yet
Andy tries to step past them
He gets shoved around, nothing serious, just some slap and tickle
Jackals sizing up prey
Hard to get
like that
Andy breaks free, flushed and shaking
He hurries off, leaving the three Sisters laughing
35	 -- '  --  (1947) 35 Andy lies staring at the darkness, unable to sleep
36	 --   --  (1947) 36 Exercise period
Red plays catch with Heywood and Jigger, lazily tossing a baseball around
Red notices Andy off to the side
Nods hello
Andy takes this as a cue to amble over
Heywood and Jigger pause, watching
(offers his hand) Hello
'm Andy Dufresne
Red glances at the hand, ignores it
The game continues
The wife-killin' banker
How do you know that
keep my ear to the ground
Why'd you do it
didn't, since you ask
Hell, you'll fit right in, then
(off Andy's look) Everyone's innocent in here, don't you know that
Heywood
What are you in for, boy
Didn't do it
Lawyer fucked me
Red gives Andy a look
See
What else have you heard
People say you're a cold fish
They say you think your shit smells sweeter than ordinary
That true
What do you think
Ain't made up my mind yet
Heywood nudges Jigger
Watch this
He winds up and throws the ball hard -- right at Andy's head
Andy sees it coming out of the corner of his eye, whirls and catches it
Beat
He sends the ball right back, zinging it into Heywood's hands
Heywood drops the ball and grimaces, wringing his stung hands
understand you're a man who knows how to get things
'm known to locate certain things from time to time
They seem to fall into my hands
Maybe it's 'cause 'm Irish
wonder if you could get me a rock-hammer
What is it and why
You make your customers' motives a part of your business
If you wanted a toothbrush, wouldn't ask questions
'd just quote a price
toothbrush, see, is a non-lethal sort of object
Fair enough
rock-hammer is about eight or nine inches long
Looks like a miniature pickaxe, with a small sharp pick on one end, and a blunt hammerhead on the other
It's for rocks
Rocks
Andy squats, motions Red to join him
Andy grabs a handful of dirt and sifts it through his hands
He finds a pebble and rubs it clean
It has a nice milky glow
He tosses it to Red
Quartz
Quartz, sure
And look
Mica
Shale
Silted granite
There's some graded limestone, from when they cut this place out of the hill
So
'm a rockhound
At least  was, in my old life
'd like to be again, on a limited scale
Yeah, that or maybe plant your toy in somebody's skull
have no enemies here
No
Just wait
Red flicks his gaze past Andy
Bogs is watching them
Word gets around
The Sisters have taken a real shine to you, yes they have
Especially Bogs
Tell me something
Would it help if explained to them 'm not homosexual
Neither are they
You have to be human first
They don't qualify
(off Andy's look) Bull queers take by force, that's all they want or understand
'd grow eyes in the back of my head if were you
Thanks for the advice
That comes free
But you understand my concern
If there's trouble,  doubt a rock- hammer will do me any good
Then  guess you wanna escape
Tunnel under the wall maybe
(Andy laughs politely) miss the joke
What's so funny
You'll know when you see the rock- hammer
What's this item usually go for
Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop
My standard mark-up's twenty percent, but we're talkin' about a special object
Risk goes up, price goes up
Call it ten bucks even
Ten it is
'll see what  can do
(rises, slapping dust) But it's a waste of money
Oh
Folks who run this place love surprise inspections
They turn a blind eye to some things, but not a gadget like that
They'll find it, and you'll lose it
Mention my name, we'll never do business again
Not for a pair of shoelaces or a stick of gum
understand
Thank you, Mr
Red
The name's Red
Red
'm Andy
Pleasure doing business with you
They shake
Andy strolls off
Red watches him go
(
) could see why some of the boys took him for snobby
He had a quiet way about him, a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here
He strolled
like a man in a park without a care or worry
Like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place
(resumes playing catch) Yes,  think it would be fair to say  liked Andy from the start
37	 --   --  (1947) 37 Red gets his breakfast and heads for a table
Andy falls in step, slips him a tightly-folded square of paper
38	 -- '  --  (1947) 38 Lying on his bunk, Red unfolds the square
ten dollar bill
(
) He was a man who adapted fast
39	 --   --  (1947) 39 Under watchful supervision,  are off-loading bags of dirty laundry from an "Eliot Nursing Home" truck
(
) Years later,  found out he'd brought in quite a bit more than just ten dollars
certain bag hits the ground
The   shoots a look at a black con, , then ambles over to a  to shoot the shit
Leonard loads the bag onto a cart
40	 --   --  (1947) 40 Bags are being unloaded
We find Leonard working the line
(
) When they check you into this hotel, one of the bellhops bends you over and looks up your works, just to make sure you're not carrying anything
But a truly determined man can get an object quite a ways up there
Leonard slips a small paper-wrapped package out of the laundry bag, hides it under his apron, and keeps sorting
4l	 --    --  (1947) 41 Red deposits his dirty bundle and moves down the line to where the clean sheets are being handed out
(
) That's how Andy joined our happy little Shawshank family with more than five hundred dollars on his person
Determination
Leonard catches Red's eye, turns and grabs a specific stack of clean sheets
He hands it across to Red -- -- and more than clean laundry changes hands
Two packs of cigarettes slide out of Red's hand into Leonard's
42	 -- '  --  (1947) 42 Red slips the package out of his sheets, carefully checks to make sure nobody's coming, then rips it open
He pulls out the rock-hammer
It's just as Andy described
Red laughs softly
(
) Andy was right
finally got the joke
It would take a man about six hundred years to tunnel under the wall with one of these
43	 --   -- 2ND  --  (1947) 43 Brooks Hatlen pushes a cart of books from cell to cell
The rolling library
He finds Red waiting for him
Red slips the rock-hammer, wrapped in a towel, through the bars and onto the cart
Next comes six cigarettes to pay for postage
Dufresne
Brooks nods, never missing a beat
He rolls his cart to Andy's cell, mutters through the bars: Middle shelf, wrapped in a towel
Andy's hand snakes through the bars and makes the object disappear
The hand comes back and deposits a small slip of folded paper along with more cigarettes
Brooks turns his cart around and goes back
He pauses, sorting his books long enough for Red to snag the slip of paper
Brooks continues on, scooping the cigarettes off the cart and into his pocket
44	 -- '  --  (1947) 44 Red unfolds the slip of paper
Penciled neatly on it is a single word: "Thanks
" 45	 --   --  (1947) 45 We are assaulted by the deafening noise of the laundry line
Andy is doing his job, getting good at it
'
Andy nods
He leaves the line, weaving his way through the laundry room and into -- 46	 --  /  --  (1947) 46 -- a dark, tangled maze of rooms and corridors, boilers and furnaces, sump pumps, old washing machines, pallets of cleaning supplies and detergents, you name it
Andy hefts a cardboard drum of Hexlite off the stack, turns around -- -- and finds Bogs Diamond in the aisle
blocking his way
Rooster looms from the shadows to his right, Pete Verness on the left
frozen beat
Andy slams the Hexlite to the floor, rips off the top, and scoops out a double handful
You get this in your eyes, it blinds you
Honey, hush
Andy backs up, holding them at bay, trying to maneuver through the maze
The Sisters keep coming, tense and guarded, eyes riveted and gauging his every move, trying to outflank him
Andy trips on some old gaint sugglies
That's all it takes
They're on him in an instant, kicking and stomping
Andy gets yanked to his feet
Bogs applies a chokehold from behind
They propel him across the room and slam him against an old four-pocket machine, bending him over it
Rooster jams a rag into Andy's mouth and secures it with a steel pipe, like a horse bit
Andy kicks and struggles, but Rooster and Pete have his arms firmly pinned
Bogs whispers in Andy's ear: That's it, fight
Better that way
Andy starts screaming, muffled by the rag
, The big Washex blocks our view
All we see is Andy's screaming face and the men holding him down
and     , leaving the dark place and the dingy act behind
up empty corridors, past concrete walls and steel pipes
(
) wish  could tell you that Andy fought the good fight, and the Sisters let him be
wish  could tell you that, but prison is no fairy-tale world
into the prison laundry past a guard,  for a final view of the line
The giant steel "mangler" is slapping down in brutal rhythm
The sound is deafening
(
) He never said who did it
but we all knew
: (1947 through 1949) 47
47 shaping his rocks after lights-out
(
) Things went on like that for a while
Prison life consists of routine, and then more routine
48 	   ,
48 (
) Every so often, Andy would show up with fresh bruises
49
,
49 (
) The Sisters kept at him
Sometimes he was able to fight them off
sometimes not
50 	           , wildly swinging a rake at his tormentors
(
) He always fought, that's what remember
He fought because he knew if he didn't fight, it would make it that much easier not to fight the next time
The rake connects, snapping off over somebody's skull
They beat the hell out of him
(
) Half the time it landed him in the infirmary
51	 --   (" ") --  (1949) 51 stone closet
No bed, sink, or lights
Just a toilet with no seat
Andy sits on bare concrete, bruised face lit by a faint ray of light falling through the tiny slit in the steel door
(
) the other half, it landed him in solitary
Warden Norton's "grain & drain" vacation
Bread, water, and all the privacy you could want
52	 --   --  (1949) 52 Andy is working the line
(
) And that's how it went for Andy
That was his routine
do believe those first two years were the worst for him
And  also believe if things had gone on that way, this place would have got the best of him
But then, in the spring of 1949, the powers-that-be decided that
53	 --   --  (1949) 53 Warden Norton addresses the assembled cons via bullhorn: the roof of the license-plate factory needs resurfacing
need a dozen volunteers for a week's work
We're gonna be taking names in this steel bucket here
Red glances around at his friends
Andy also catches his eye
(
) It was outdoor detail, and May is one damn fine month to be workin' outdoors
54	 --   --  (1949) 54 Cons shuffle past, dropping slips of paper into a bucket
(
) More than a hundred men volunteered for the job
Red saunters to a guard named  , mutters discreetly in his ear
55	 --   --  (1949) 55 Youngblood is pulling names and reading them off
Red exchanges grins with Andy and the others
(
) Wouldn't you know it
Me and some fellas  know were among the names called
56	 --   --  (1949) 56 Red slips Youngblood six packs of cigarettes
(
) Only cost us a pack of smokes per man
made my usual twenty percent, of course
57	 --    --  (1949) 57 tar-cooker bubbles and smokes
dip up a bucket of tar and tie a rope to the handle
The rope goes taught the bucket of tar up the side of the building to -- 58 	  58 -- where it is relayed to the work detail
the men are dipping big Padd brushes and spreading the tar
to Byron Hadley bitching sourly to his fellow guards: so this shithead lawyer calls long distance from Texas, and he says, Byron Hadley
say, yeah
He says, sorry to inform you, but your brother just died
Damn, Byron
Sorry to hear that
ain't
He was an asshole
Run off years ago, family ain't heard of him since
Figured him for dead anyway
So this lawyer prick says, your brother died a rich man
Oil wells and shit, close to a million bucks
Jesus, it's frigging incredible how lucky some assholes can get
million bucks
Jeez-Louise
You get any of that
Thirty five thousand
That's what he left me
Dollars
Holy shit, that's great
Like winnin' a lottery
(off Hadley's shitty look) ain't it
Dumbshit
What do you figger the government's gonna do to me
Take a big wet bite out of my ass, is what
Oh
Hadn't thought of that
Maybe leave me enough to buy a new car with
Then what happens
You pay tax on the car
Repairs and maintenance
Goddamn kids pesterin' you to take 'em for a ride
And drive it, if they're old enough
That's right, wanting to drive it, wanting to learn on it, f'Chrissake
Then at the end of the year, if you figured the tax wrong, they make you pay out of your own pocket
Uncle Sam puts his hand in your shirt and squeezes your tit till it's purple
Always get the short end
That's a fact
(spits over the side) Some brother
Shit
The prisoners keep spreading tar, eyes on their work
Poor Byron
What terrible fuckin' luck
Imagine inheriting thirty five thousand dollars
Crying shame
Some folks got it awful bad
Red glances over -- and is shocked to see Andy standing up, listening to the guards talk
Hey, you nuts
Keep your eyes on your pail
Andy tosses his Padd in the bucket and strolls toward Hadley
Andy
Come back
Shit
What's he doing
Gettin' himself killed
God damn it
Just keep spreadin' tar
The guards stiffen at Andy's approach
Youngblood's hand goes to his holster
The tower guards - their rifle bolts
Hadley turns, stupefied to find Andy there
Mr
Hadley
Do you trust your wife
That's funny
You're gonna look funnier suckin' my dick with no fuckin' teeth
What  mean is, do you think she'd go behind your back
Try to hamstring you
That's it
Step aside, Mert
This fucker's havin' hisself an accident
Hadley grabs Andy's collar and propels him violently toward the edge of the roof
The cons furiously keep spreading tar
Oh God, he's gonna do it, he's gonna throw him off the roof
Oh shit, oh fuck, oh Jesus
Because if you do trust her, there's no reason in the world you can't keep every cent of that money
Hadley abruptly jerks Andy to a stop right at the edge
In fact, Andy's past the edge, beyond his balance, shoetips scraping the roof
The only thing between him and an ugly drop to the concrete is Hadley's grip on the front of his shirt
You better start making sense
If you want to keep that money, all of it, just give it to your wife
See, the  allows you a one-time- only gift to your spouse
It's good up to sixty thousand dollars
Naw, that ain't right
Tax free
Tax free
can't touch one cent
The cons are pausing work, stunned by this business discussion
You're the smart banker what shot his wife
Why should  believe a smart banker like you
So's  can wind up in here with you
It's perfectly legal
Go ask the , they'll say the same thing
Actually,  feel silly telling you all this
'm sure you would have investigated the matter yourself
Fuckin'-
don't need no smart wife-killin' banker to show me where the bear shit in the buckwheat
Of course not
But you will need somebody to set up the tax-free gift, and that'll cost you lawyer, for example
Ambulance-chaaing, highway-robbing cocksuckers
or come to think of it, suppose  could set it up for you
That would save you some money
'll write down the forms you need, you can pick them up, and 'll prepare them for your signature
nearly free of charge
(off Hadley's look) 'd only ask three beers apiece for my co-workers, if that seems fair
(guffawing) Co-workers
Get him
That's rich, ain't it
Co-workers
Hadley freezes him with a look
Andy presses on: think a nan working outdoors feels more like a man if he can have a bottle of suds
That's only my opinion
The convicts stand gaping, all pretense of work gone
They look like they've been pole-axed
Hadley shoots them a look
What are you jimmies starin' at
Back to work, goddamn it
59	 --    --  (1949) 59 As before, an object is hauled up the side of the building by rope -- only this time, it's a cooler of beer and ice
(
) And that's how it came to pass, that on the second-to-last day of the job, the convict crew that tarred the plate factory roof in the spring of '49
60	 --  --   (1949) 60 The cons are taking the sun and drinking beer
(
) wound up sitting in a row at ten o'clock in the morning, drinking icy cold Black Label beer courtesy of the hardest screw that ever walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison
Drink up, boys
While it's cold
(
) The colossal prick even managed to sound magnanimous
Red knocks back another sip, enjoying the bitter cold on his tongue and the warm sun on face
(
) We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders, and felt like free men
We could'a been tarring the roof of one of our own houses
We were the Lords of all Creation
He glances over to Andy squatting apart from the others
(
) As for Andy, he spent that break hunkered in the shade, a strange little smile on his face, watching us drink his beer
(approaches with a beer) Here's a cold one, Andy
No thanks
gave up drinking
Heywood drifts back to others, giving them a look
(
) You could argue he'd done it to curry favor with the guards
Or maybe make a few friends among us cons
Me,  think he did it just to feel normal again
if only for a short while
61	 --   --   --  (1949) 61 Andy and Red play checkers
Red makes his move
King me
Chess
Now there's a game of kings
Civilized
strategic
and totally fuckin' inexplicable
Hate that game
Maybe you'll let me teach you someday
've been thinking of getting a board together
You come to the right place
'm the man who can get things
We might do business on a board
But the pieces, 'd like to carve those myself
One side done in quartz
the opposing side in limestone
That'd take you years
Years 've got
What  don't have are the rocks
Pickings here in the exercise yard are pretty slim
How's that rock-hammer workin' out anyway
Scratch your name on your wall yet
(smiles) Not yet
suppose  should
Andy
guess we're gettin' to be friends, ain't we
suppose we are
ask a question
Why'd you do it
'm innocent, remember
Just like everybody else here
Red takes this as a gentle rebuff, keeps playing
What are you in for, Red
Murder
Same as you
Innocent
The only guilty man in Shawshank
62	 -- '  --  (1949) 62 Andy lies in his bunk after lights out, polishing a fragment of quartz by the light of the moon
He pauses, glancing at all the names scratched in the wall
He rises, makes sure the coast is clear, and starts scratching his name into the cement with his rock-hammer, adding to the record
63 	  63 fills the screen in glorious (and scratchy) black & white, suffering a bad case of 's
64	 --   --  (1949) 64 while a   hoots and catcalls, talking back to the screen
We find Red slouched in a folding chair, watching the movie
Andy enters, backlit by the flickering glare of the projector, and takes a seat next to him
Here's the good part
Bugs come out of the walls to get his ass
know
've seen it three times this month already
Ray Milland starts
The entire audience  with him, high-pitched and hysterical
Andy fidgets
Can we talk business
Sure
What do you want
Rita Hayworth
Can you get her
No problem
Take a few weeks
Weeks
Don't have her stuffed down my pants this very moment, sorry to say
Relax
What are you so nervous about
She's just a woman
Andy nods, embarrassed
He gets up and hurries out
Red grins, turns back to the movie
65	 --   --  (1949) 65 Andy exits the theater and freezes in his tracks
Two dark figures loom in the corridor, blocking his path
Rooster and Pete
Andy turns back -- and runs right into Bogs
Instant bear hug
The Sisters are on him like a flash
They kick a door open and drag him into -- 66 	   66 -- where they confront the startled , an old con blinking at them through thick bifocals
Take a walk
have to change reels
said fuck off
Terrified, the old man darts past and out the door
Pete slams and locks it
Bogs shoves Andy to the center of the room

Ain't you gonna scream
Andy sighs, cocks his head at the projector
They'd never hear me over that
Let's get this over with
Seemingly resigned, Andy turns around, leans on the rewind bench -- and curls his fingers around a full 1
000 foot reel of 35mm film
Rooster licks his lips, pushes past the others
Me first
Okay
Andy whips the reel of film around in a vicious arc, smashing it into Rooster's face and bouncing him off the wall
Fuck
Shit
He broke my nose
Andy fights like hell, but is soon overpowered and forced to his knees
Bogs steps to Andy, pulls out an awl with a vicious eight-inch spike, gives him a good long look at it
Now 'm gonna open my fly, and you're gonna swallow what  give you to swallow
And when you d mine, you gonna swallow Rooster's
You done broke his nose, so he ought to have somethin' to show for it
Anything you put in my mouth, you're going to lose
You don't understand
You do that, 'll put all eight inches of this steel ii your ear
Okay
But you should know that sudden serious brain injury causes the victim to bite down
Hard
(faint smile) In fact,  understand the bite-reflex is so strong the victim's jaws have to be pried open with a crowbar
The Sisters consider this carefully
The film runs out of the projector, flapping on the reel
The screen goes white
You little fuck
Andy gets a bootheel in the face
The Sisters start kicking and beating the living shit out of him with anything they can get their hands on
In the theater, the convicts are for the movie to come back on
(
) Bogs didn't put anything in Andy's mouth, and neither did his friends
What they did do is beat him within an inch of his life
67	 --  --  (1949) 67 Andy lies wrapped in bandages
(
) Andy spent a month in traction
68	 --   --  (1949) 68 (
) Bogs spent a week in the hole
Bogs sits on bare concrete
The steel door slides open
Time's up, Bogs
69	 --   -- 3RD  --  (1949) 69 Bogs comes up the stairs, smoking a cigarette
Not many cons around; the place is virtually deserted echoes dimly over the
system: (
) Return to your cellblocks for evening count
Bogs enters his cell
Dark in here
He fumbles for the light cord, yanks it
The sudden light reveals Captain Hadley six inches from his face, waiting for him
Mert steps in behind Bogs
hemming him
Before Bogs can even open his mouth to say "what the fuck," Hadley rams the tip of his baton brutally into his solar plexus
Bogs doubles over, gagging his wind out
70 	  70 Ernie comes slowly around the corner, rolling a steel mop cart loaded with supplies
71 	2ND  71 Red is darning a sock in his open cell
He pauses, frowning, hearing strange  sounds
What the hell is that
72 	3RD  72 It's Hadley and Mert methodically and brutally pulping Bogs with their batons, and kicking the shit out of him for good measure
He feebly tries to ward them off
73 	2ND  73 Puzzled, Red steps from his cell, following the sound
It dawns on him that it's coming from above
He moves to the railing and leans out, craning around to look up -- 74 	'  74 -- just as Bogs flips over the railing and comes sailing directly toward us, eyes bugging out,  as he falls
75 	 ( ) 75 jumps back as Bogs plummets past, missing him by inches, arms swimming and trying to grab the railing (but missing that too),  aaaaalll the way down -- 76 	  76 -- and impacting on Ernie's gassing mop cart in an enormous eruption of solvents and cleansers
The cart is squashed flat, shooting out from under Bogs and skidding across the cellblock floor like a tiddly wink, kicking up sparks for thirty yards
Ernie is left gaping in shock at Bogs and all the Bogs-related wreckage at his feet
77 	2ND  77 Red is stunned
He very tentatively leans out and looks up
Above him, Hadley and Mert lean on the 3rd tier railing
Hadley tilts the cap back on his head, shakes his head
Damn, Byron
Look'a that
Poor fella must'a tripped
tiny drop of blood drips off the toe of Hadley's shoe and splashes across Red's upturned cheek
He wipes it off, then looks down at Bogs
Cons and guards are racing to the scene
(
) Two things never happened again after that
The Sisters never laid a finger on Andy again
7B	 --  /  --  (1949) 78 Bogs, wheelchair-bound and wearing a neck brace, is loaded onto an ambulance for transport
Behind the fence stand Red and his friends, watching
(
) and Bogs never walked again
They transferred him to a minimum security hospital upstate
To my knowledge, he lived out the rest of his days drinking his food through a straw
'm thinkin' Andy could use a nice welcome back when he gets out of the infirmary
Sounds good to us
Figure we owe him for the beer
Man likes to play chess
Let's get him some rocks
79	 --  --  (1949) 79 at work
Hoes rise and fall in long waves
patrol on horseback
Heywood turns up a rocky chunk, quickly shoves it down his pants
He maneuvers to Red and the others, pulls out the chunk and shows it to them
That ain't quartz
Nor limestone
What are you, fuckin' geologist
He's right, it ain't
What the hell is it then
Horse apple
Bullshit
No, horse shit
Petrified
Cackling, the men go back to work
Heywood stares at the rock
He crumbles it in his hands
(
) Despite a few hitches, the boys came through in fine style
80	 --   --   --  (1949) 80 huge detergent box is filled with rocks, hidden in the shadows behind a boiler furnace
(
) and by the week Andy was due back, we had enough rocks saved up to keep him busy till Rapture
to Red as he plops a bag of "laundry" on the floor
Leonard and Bob toss a few more down
Red starts pulling out contraband, giving them their commissions
(
) Also got a big shipment in that week
Cigarettes, chewing gum, shoelaces, playing cards with naked ladies on 'em, you name it
(pulls a cardboard tube) and, of course, the most important item
81	 --   --  (1949) 81 Andy, limping a bit, returns from the infirmary
Red watches from his cell as Andy is brought up and locked away
82	 -- '  --  (1949) 82 Andy finds the cardboard tube lying on his bunk
(
) Lights out
The lights go off
Andy opens the tube and pulls out a large rolled poster
He lets it uncurl to the floor
small scrap of paper flutters out, landing at his feet
The poster is the famous Rita Hayworth pin-up -- one hand behind her head, eyes half closed, sulky lips parted
Andy picks up the scrap of paper
It reads: "No charge
Welcome back
" Alone in the dark, Andy smiles
83	 --   --  (1949) 83 The  , the cells
Cons step from their cells
Andy catches Red's eye, nods his thanks
As the men shuffle down to breakfast, Red glances into Andy's cell -- 84 	'  --   84 -- and sees Rita in her new place of honor on Andy's wall
Sunlight casts a harsh barred shadow across her lovely face
85	 --   --  (1949) 85 Ernie is mopping the floor
He glances back and sees Warden Norton approach the cellblock with an entourage of a Still mopping, Ernie mutters to the nearest cell: Heads up
They're tossin' cells
Word travels fast from cell to cell
Cons scramble to tidy up and hide things
Norton enters, nods to his men
The guards pair off in all directions, making their choices at random
What kind'a contraband you hiding in there, boy
Cells are opened, occupants displaced, items scattered, mattresses overturned
Whatever contraband is found gets tossed out onto the cellblock floor
Mostly harmless stuff
pulls a sharpened screwdriver out of a mattress, shoots a nasty look at the  responsible
Solitary
week
Make sure he takes his Bible
Too goddamn dark to read down there
Add another week for blasphemy
The man is taken away
Norton's gaze goes up
Let's try the second tier
86 	2ND  86 Norton arrives, makes a thin show of picking a cell at random
He motions at Andy on his bunk, reading his Bible
The door is unlocked
Norton enters, trailed by his men
Andy rises
Good evening
Norton gives a curt nod
Hadley and Trout start tossing the cell in a thorough search
Norton keeps his eyes on Andy, looking for a wrong glance or nervous blink
He takes the Bible out of Andy's hand
'm pleased to see you reading this
Any favorite passages
Watch ye therefore, for ye know not when the master of the house cometh
(smiles) Luke
Chapter 13, verse 35
've always liked that one
(strolls the cell) But  prefer: " am the light of the world
He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life
" John
Chapter 8, verse 12
hear you're good with numbers
How nice
man should have a skill
You wanna explain this
Andy glances over
Hadley is holding up a rock blanket, a polishing cloth roughly the size of an oven mitt
It's called a rock blanket
It's for shaping and polishing rocks
Little hobby of mine
Hadley glances at the rocks lining the window sill, turns to Norton
Looks pretty clean
Some contraband here, nothing to get in a twist over
Norton nods, strolls to the poster of Rita
can't say  approve of this
(turns to Andy) but  suppose exceptions can always be made
Norton exits, the guards follow
The cell door is slammed and locked
Norton pauses, turns back
almost forgot
He reaches through the bars and returns the Bible to Andy
'd hate to deprive you of this
Salvation lies within
Norton and his men walk away
(
) Tossin' cells was just an excuse
Truth is, Norton wanted to size Andy up
87	 --   --  (1949) 87 Andy is working the line
Hadley enters and confers briefly with Bob
Bob nods, crosses to Andy, taps him
Andy turns, removes an earplug
Bob shouts over the machine noise: '
88	 --  '  --  (1949) 88 Andy is led in
Norton is at his desk doing paperwork
Andy's eyes go to a framed needle-point sampler on the wall behind him that reads: "
" My wife made that in church group
It's very pretty, sir
You like working in the laundry
No, sir
Not especially
Perhaps we can find something more befitting a man of your education

Andy enters
He hears a An adult crow lands on a filing cabinet and struts back and forth, checking him out
Andy smiles
Hey, Jake
Where's Brooks
Brooks Hatlen pokes his head out of the back room
Andy
Thought  heard you out here
've been reassigned to you
know, they told me
Ain't that a kick in the ass
Come on in, 'll give you the dime tour
90	 --    --  (1949) 90 Brooks leads Andy into the bleakest back room of all
Rough plank shelves are lined with books
Brooks' private domain
Here she is, the Shawshank Prison Library
Along this side, we got the National Geographics
That side, the Reader's Digest Condensed books
Bottom shelf there, some Louis 'Amours and Erle Stanley Gardners
Every night  pile the cart and make my rounds
write down the names on this clipboard here
Well, that's it
Easy, peasy, Japanesey
Any questions
Andy pauses
Something about this doesn't make any sense
Brooks
How long have you been librarian
Since 1912
Yuh, over 37 years
In all that time, have you ever had an assistant
Never needed one
Not much to it, is there
So why now
Why me
dunno
Be nice to have some comp'ny down here for a change

Dekins approaches Andy ominously
Andy stands his ground, waiting for whatever comes next
Finally: 'm Dekins
been, uh, thinkin' 'bout maybe settin' up some kinda trust fund for my kids' educations
Andy covers his surprise
Glances at Brooks
Brooks smiles
see
Well
Why don't we have a seat and talk it over
Pull down one'a them desks there
Andy and Dekins grab a desk standing on end and tilt it to the floor
They find chairs and settle in
Brooks returns with a tablet of paper and a pen, slides them before Andy
What did you have in mind
weekly draw on your pay
Yuh
figured just stick it in the bank, but Captain Hadley said check with you first
He was right
You don't want your money in a bank
don't
What's that gonna earn you
Two and a half, three percent a year
We can do a lot better than that
(wets his pen) So tell me, Mr
Dekins
Where do you want to send your kids
Harvard
Yale
92	 --   --  (1949) 92 He didn't say that
God is my witness
And Dekins, he just blinks for a second, then laughs his ass off
Afterward, he actually shook Andy's hand
My ass
Shook his fuckin' hand
Just about shit myself
All Andy needed was a suit and tie, a jiggly little hula girl on his desk, he would'a been Mister Dufresne, if you please
Makin' yourself some friends, Andy
wouldn't say "friends
" 'm a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning
That's a wonderful pet to have
Got you out of the laundry, didn't it
Maybe it can do more than that
(off their looks) How about expanding the library
Get some new books in there
How you 'spect to do that, "Mr
Dufresne-if-you-please
" Ask the warden for funds
all around
Andy blinks at them
Son, 've had six wardens through here during my tenure, and  have learned one great immutable truth of the universe: ain't one of 'em been born whose asshole don't pucker up tight as a snare drum when you ask for funds
93	 --    --  (1949) 93 Norton and Andy up the hall: Not a dime
My budget's stretched thin as it is
see
Perhaps  could write to the State Senate and request funds directly from them
Far as them Republican boys in Augusta are concerned, there's only three ways to spend the taxpayer's hard-earned when it come to prisons
More walls
More bars
More guards
Still, 'd like to try, with your permission
'll send a letter a week
They can't ignore me forever
They sure can, but you write your letters if it makes you happy
'll even mail 'em for you, how's that
94	 -- '  --  (1949) 94 Andy is on his bunk, writing a letter
(
) So Andy started writing a letter a week, just like he said
95	 --  /'   --  (1949) 95 Andy pops his head in
The  shakes his head
(
) And just like Norton said, Andy got no answers
But still he kept on
96	 --  /'  --  (1950) 96 Andy is doing taxes
Mert Entwhistle is seated across from him
Other off-duty guards are waiting their turn
(
) The following April, Andy did tax returns for half the guards at Shawshank
97	 --   --    (1951) 97 Tax time again
Even more guards are waiting
(
) Year after that, he did them all
including the warden's
98	 --   --  (1952) 98 in a "Noresby Marauders" baseball uniform  the ball high into left field and races for first
(
) Year after that, they rescheduled the start of the intramural season to coincide with tax season
99	 --  /'  --  (1952) 99 The Batter sits across from Andy
The line winds out the door
(
) The guards on the opposing teams all remembered to bring their -2's
Moresby Prison issued you that gun, but you actually had to pay for it
Damn right, and the holster too
See, that's all deductible
You get to write that off
(
) Yes sir, Andy was a regular & Block
In fact, he got so busy at tax time, he was allowed a staff
to reveal Red and Brooks doing filing chores
Say Red, could you hand me a stack of those 1040s
(
) Got me out of the wood shop a month out of the year, and that was fine by me
100	 --  /'   --  (1953) 100 Andy enters and drops a letter on the outgoing stack
(
) And still he kept sending those letters
101	 -- '  --  (1953) 101 Dark
Andy's in his bunk, polishing a four-inch length of quartz
It's a beautifully-crafted chess piece in the shape of a horse's head, poise and nobility captured in gleaming stone
He puts the knight on a chess board by his bed, adding it to four pieces already there: a king, a queen, and two bishops
He turns to Rita
Moonlight casts bars across her face
102	 --   --  (1954) 102 Floyd runs into the yard, scared and winded
He finds Andy and Red on the bleachers
Red
Andy
It's Brooks
103	 --  /'  --  (1954) 103 Floyd rushes in with Andy and Red at his heels
They find Jigger and Snooze trying to calm Brooks, who has Heywood in a chokehold and a knife to his throat
Heywood is terrified
'mon, Brooksie, why don't you just calm the fuck down, okay
Goddamn miserable puke-eatin' sons of whores
He kicks a table over
Tax files explode through the air
What the hell's going on
You tell me, man
One second he was fine, then out came the knife better get the guards
No
We'll handle this
Ain't that right, Brooks
Just settle down and we'll talk about it, okay
Nothing left to talk about
It's all talked out
Nothing left now but to cut his fuckin' throat
Why
What's Heywood done to you
That's what they want
It's the price  gotta pay
Andy steps forward, rivets Brooks with a gaze
Softly: Brooks, you're not going to hurt Heywood, we all know that
Even Heywood knows it, right Heywood
(nods, terrified) Sure
know that
Sure
Why
Ask anyone, they'll tell you
Brooks Hatlen is a reasonable man
(cuing nods all around) Yeah, that's right
That's what everybody says
You're not fooling anybody, so just put the damn knife down and stop scaring the shit out of people
But it's the only way they'll let me stay
Brooks bursts into tears
The storm is over
Heywood staggers free, gasping for air
Andy takes the knife, passes it to Red
Brooks dissolves into Andy's arms with great heaving sobs
Take it easy
You'll be all right
Him
What about me
Crazy old fool
Goddamn near slit my throat
You've had worse from shaving
What'd you do to set him off
Nothin'
Just came in to say fare-thee-well
(off their looks) Ain't you heard
His parole came through
Red and Andy exchange a surprised look
Andy wants to understand
Red just motions to let it be for now
He puts his arm around Brooks, who sobs inconsolably
Softly: Ain't that bad, old hoss
Won't be long till you're squiring pretty young girls on your arm and telling 'em lies
104	 --    --  (1954) 104 just don't understand what happened in there, that's all
Old man's crazy as a rat in a tin shithouse, is what
Heywood, enough
Ain't nothing wrong with Brooksie
He's just institutionalized, that's all
Institutionalized, my ass
Man's been here fifty years
This place is all he knows
In here, he's an important man, an educated man
librarian
Out there, he's nothing but a used-up old con with arthritis in both hands
Couldn't even get a library card if he applied
You see what 'm saying
Red,  do believe you're talking out of your ass
Believe what you want
These walls are funny
First you hate 'em, then you get used to 'em
After long enough, you get so you depend on 'em
That's "institutionalized
" Shit
could never get that way
(softly) Say that when you been inside as long as Brooks has
Goddamn right
They send you here for life, and that's just what they take
Part that counts, anyway
105	 --   --  (1954) 105 The sun rises over gray stone
106	 -- '  --  (1954) 106 Sexy as ever
The rising sun sends fingers of rosy light creeping across her face
107	 --  --  (1954) 107 Brooks stands on a chair, poised at the bars of a window, cradling Jake in his hands
can't take care of you no more
You go on now
You're free
He tosses Jake through the bars
The crow flaps away
108	 --   --   --  (1954) 108 herald the opening of the gate
It swings hugely open, revealing Brooks standing in his cheap suit, carrying a cheap bag, wearing a cheap hat
Brooks walks out, tears streaming down his face
He looks back
Red, Andy, and others stand at the inner fence, seeing him off
The massive gate closes, wiping them from view
109	 --  --  (1954) 109 Brooks is riding the bus, clutching the seat before him, gripped by terror of speed and motion
(
) Dear Fellas
can't believe how fast things move on the outside
110	 --  -- ,  --  (1954) 110 Brooks looks like a kid trying to cross the street without his parents
People and traffic a blur
(
) saw an automobile once when  was young
Now they're everywhere
111	 --   --  (1954) 111 Brooks comes trudging up the sidewalk
He glances up as a prop-driven airliner streaks in low overhead
(
) The world went and got itself in a big damn hurry
He arrives at the Brewster
It ain't much to look at
112	 --   --  (1954) 112 leads Brooks up the stairs toward the top floor
He has trouble climbing so many stairs
No music in your room after eight p
m
No guests after nine
No cooking except on the hotplate
(
) People even talk faster
And louder
113	 -- '  --  (1954) 113 Brooks enters
The room is small, old, dingy
Heavy wooden beams cross the ceiling
An arched window affords a view of Congress Street
Traffic noise drifts in
Brooks sets his bag down
He doesn't quite know what to do
He just stands there, like a man waiting for a bus
(
) The parole board got me into this halfway house called the Brewster, and a job bagging groceries at the Foodway
114	 --   --  (1954) 114 Loud
Jangling with  and
Brooks is bagging groceries
Registers are humming, kids are shrieking
Make sure he double-bags
Last time your man didn't double-bag and the bottom near came out
You double-bag like the lady says, understand
Yes sir, double-bag, surely will
(
) It's hard work
try to keep up, but my hands hurt most of the time
don't think the store manager likes me very much
115	 --  --  (1954) 115 Brooks sits alone on a bench, feeding pigeons
(
) Sometimes after work  go to the park and feed the birds
keep thinking Jake might show up and say hello, but he never does
hope wherever he is, he's doing okay and making new friends
116	 -- '  --  (1954) 116 Dark
Traffic outside
Brooks wakes up
Disoriented
Afraid
Somewhere in the night, a   is taking place
(
) have trouble sleeping at night
The bed is too big
have bad dreams, like 'm falling
wake up scared
Sometimes it takes me a while to remember where  am
117	 --  --  (1954) 117 (
) Maybe  should get me a gun and rob the Foodway, so they'd send me home
could shoot the manager while was at it, sort of like a bonus
118	 -- '  --  (1954) 118 Brooks is packing his worldly possessions into the carry bag
Undershirts, socks, etc
(
) But  guess 'm too old for that sort of nonsense anymore
119	 -- '  --   (1954) 119 Brooks is dressed in his suit
He finishes knotting his tie, puts his hat on his head
The letter lies on the desk, stampe3 and ready for mailing
His bag is by the door
(
) don't like it here
'm tired of being afraid all the time
've decided not to stay
He takes one last look around
Only one thing left to do
He steps to a wooden chair in the center of the room, pulls out s pocketknife, and glances up at the ceiling beam
He steps up onto the chair
It wobbles queasily
Now facing the beam, he carves a message into the wood: "Brooks Hatlen was here
" He smiles with a sort of inner peace
(
) doubt they'll kick up any fuss
Not for an old crook like me
120 	   120 His weight shifts on the wobbly chair -- and it goes out from under him
His feet remain where they are, kicking feebly in mid-air
His hat falls to the floor
Brooks has hanged himself
He swings gently, facing the open window
Traffic noise floats up from below
121	 --   --  --  (1954) 121 Andy reads the letter to Red and the others: Tell Heywood 'm sorry  put a knife to his throat
No hard feelings
long silence
Andy folds the letter, puts it away
Softly: He should'a died in here, goddamn it
122	 --   --  (1954) 122 Andy is sorting books on the cart
He replaces a stack on the shelf -- and pauses, noticing a line of ants crawling up the wood
He glances up
The ants disappear over the top
He pulls a chair over and stands on it, peers cautiously over
Red
Red steps in with an armload of files
Andy gingerly reaches in, grabs a black feathered wing, and pulls out a dead crow
(softly) Is that Jake
123	 --   --  (1954) 123 Red is making something at his bench, sanding and planing
(
) It never would have occurred to us, if not for Andy
It was his idea
We all agreed it was the right thing to do
124	 --  --  (1954) 124 Low hilly terrain all around
are at work in the fields
patrol with carbines, keeping a sharp eye
We find Andy, Red, and the boys working with picks and shovels
They glance over to the pickup truck
Hadley's chewing the fat with Mert and Youngblood
Water break
Five minutes
The work stops
Cons head for the pickup truck, where water is dispensed with dipper and pail
Red and the boys look to Andy
Andy nods
Now's the time
The group moves off through the confusion, using it as cover
They head up the slope of a nearby hill and quickly decide on a suitable spot
The guards haven't noticed
Jigger and Floyd start swinging picks into the soft earth, quickly ripping out a hole
Red reaches into his jacket and pulls out a beautiful wooden box, carefully stained and varnished
He shows it around to nods of approval
That's real pretty, Red
Nice work
Shovel man in
Watch the dirt
124 	 124 Heywood jumps in and starts spading out the hole
125 	   125 Youngblood glances up and sees the men on the slope
What the fuck
(follows his gaze) '
' (works his rifle bolt) ' Suddenly, other cons start breaking away in groups, dozens of them heading toward the slope
The guards look around
What am , talkin' to myself
126 	   126 Andy pulls a towel-wrapped bundle from his jacket and unfolds it
Jake
Andy lays him in the box, followed by Brook's letter
Red places the casket in the hole
moment of silence
Andy gives Red with an encouraging nod
Lord
Brooks was a sinner
Jake was just a crow
Neither was much to look at
Both got institutionalized
See what you can do for 'em
Amen
Muttered "amens" all around
The boys shovel dirt onto the small grave and tamp it down
127	 --   --  (1955) 127 with Hadley
He's striding, pissed-off, a man on e mission
He straight-arms a door and emerges onto -- 128	 --    --  (1955) 128 -- the wall overlooking the exercise yard
He leans on the railing, scans the yard, sees Andy chatting with Red
Dufresne
What the fuck did you do
(Andy looks up) Your ass, warden's office, now
Andy shoots a worried look at Red, then heads off
129	 --  /'   --  (1955) 129 Dozens of parcel boxes litter the floor
, the duty guard, picks through them
Hadley enters, trailed by Andy
What is all this
You tell me, fuck-stick
They're addressed to you, every damn one
Wiley thrusts an envelope at Andy
Andy just stares at it
Well, take it
Andy takes the envelope, pulls out a letter, reads: Dear Mr
Dufresne
In response to your repeated inquiries, the State Senate has allocated the enclosed funds for your library project
" (stunned, examines check) This is two hundred dollars
Wiley grins
Hadley glares at him
The grin vanishes
In addition, the Library District has generously responded with a charitable donation of used books and sundries
We trust this will fill your needs
We now consider the matter closed
Please stop sending us letters
Yours truly, the State Comptroller's Office
Andy gazes around at the boxes
The riches of the world lay at his feet
His eyes mist with emotion at the sight
want all this cleared out before the warden gets back,  shit you not
Hadley exits
Andy touches the boxes like a love-struck man touching a beautiful woman
Wiley grins
Good for you, Andy
Only took six years
(beat) From now on,  send two letters a week instead of one
(laughs, shakes his head) believe you're crazy enough
You better get this stuff downstairs like the Captain said
'm gonna go pinch a loaf
When  get back, this is all gone, right
Andy nods
Wiley disappears into the toilet, Jughead Comix in hand
Alone now, Andy starts going through the boxes like a starving man exploring packages of food
He doesn't know where to turn first
He gets giddy, ripping boxes open and pulling out books, touching them, smelling them
He rips open another box
This one contains an old phonograph player, industrial gray and green, the words "Portland Public School District" stenciled on the side
The box also contains stacks and stacks of used record albums
Andy reverently slips a stack from the box and starts flipping through them
Used Nat King Coles, Bing Crosbys, etc
He comes across a certain album -- Mozart's "Le Nozze de Figaro
" He pulls it from the stack, gazing upon it as a man transfixed
It is a thing of beauty
It is the Grail
130	 --  --  (1955) 130 Wiley sits in one of the stalls, Jughead comic on his knees
131	 --  /  --  (1955) 131 Andy wrestles the phonograph player onto the guards' desk, sweeping things onto the floor in his haste
He plugs the machine in
red light warms up
The platter starts spinning
He slides the Mozart album from its sleeve, lays it on the platter, and lowers the tone arm to his favorite cut
The needle  in the groove
and the  begins, lilting and gorgeous
Andy sinks into Wiley's chair, overcome by its beauty
It is "Deutino: Che soave zeffiretto," a duet sung by Susanna and the Contessa
132	 --  --  (1955) 132 Wiley pauses reading, puzzled
He thinks he hears music
Andy
You hear that
133	 --  /  --  (1955) 133 Andy shoots a look at the bathroom
and smiles
Go for broke
He lunges to his feet and barricades the front door, then the bathroom
He returns to the desk and positions the
microphone
He works up his courage, then flicks all the toggles to "on
"     echoes briefly
134 / --
--  (1955) 134 and the Mozart is suddenly broadcast all over the prison
135	 --  --  (1955) 135 Wiley lunges to his feet, pants tangling around his ankles
136 / --   --   --  (1955) 136 Cons all over the prison stop whatever they're doing, freezing in mid-step to listen, gazing up at the speakers
137
137 138 	    ,
138 139 	      ,
139 140
140 thru yard
the numbing routine of prison life itself
all grinds thru 143
,
143 just stands in place, listening to the , hypnotized
144	 --   --  (1955) 144 Andy is reclined in the chair, transported, arms fluidly conducting the music
Ecstasy and rapture
Shawshank no longer exists
It has been banished from the mind of men
145	 --   --  (1955) 145 along groups of men, all riveted
(
) have no idea to this day what them two Italian ladies were singin' about
Truth is,  don't want to know
Some things are best left unsaid
like to think they were singin' about something so beautiful it can't be expressed in words, and makes your heart ache because of it
brings us to Red
(
) tell you, those voices soared
Higher and farther than anybody in a gray place dares to dream
It was like some beautiful bird flapped into our drab little cage and made these walls dissolve away
and for the briefest of moments -- every last man at Shawshank felt free
146	 --   --  (1955) 146 with Norton striding up the hallway with Hadley
(
) It pissed the warden off something terrible
147	 --  /  --  (1955) 147 Norton and Hadley break the door in
Andy looks up with a sublime smile
We hear Wiley  on the bathroom door: (
) 148	 --   --  (1955) 148 on the massive, rust-streaked steel door
God, this is a terrible place to be
(
) Andy got two weeks in the hole for that little stunt
149	 --   --  (1955) 149 Andy doesn't seem to mind
His arms sweep to the music still playing in his head
We hear a   of the soaring duet
150	 --   --  (1955) 1 50 Couldn't play somethin' good, huh
Hank Williams
They broke the door down before could take requests
Was it worth two weeks in the hole
Easiest time  ever did
Shit
No such thing as easy time in the hole
week seems like a year
had Mr
Mozart to keep me company
Hardly felt the time at all
Oh, they let you tote that record player down there, huh
could'a swore they confiscated that stuff
(taps his heart, his head) The music was here
and here
That's the one thing they can't confiscate, not ever
That's the beauty of it
Haven't you ever felt that way about music, Red
Played a mean harmonica as a younger man
Lost my taste for it
Didn't make much sense on the inside
Here's where it makes most sense
We need it so we don't forget
Forget
That there are things in this world not carved out of gray stone
That there's a small place inside of us they can never lock away, and that place is called hope
Hope is a dangerous thing
Drive a man insane
It's got no place here
Better get used to the idea
(softly) Like Brooks did
151 	 -  151 slides open with an enormous
stark room beyond
through
sit at a long table
An empty chair faces them
We are again in: --    --  (1957) Red enters, ten years older than when we first saw him at a parole hearing
He removes his cap and sits
#l It says here you've served thirty years of a life sentence
#2 You feel you've been rehabilitated
Yes sir, without a doubt
can say 'm a changed man
No danger to society, that's the God's honest truth
Absolutely rehabilitated
-- big rubber stamp slams down: "
" 152	 --   --  (1957) 152 Red emerges into fading daylight
Andy's waiting for him
Same old, same old
Thirty years
Jesus
When you say it like that
You wonder where it went
wonder where ten years went
Red nods, solemn
They settle in on the bleachers
Andy pulls a small box from his sweater, hands it to Red
Anniversary gift
Open it
Red does
Inside the box, on a thin layer of cotton, is a shiny new harmonica, bright aluminum and circus-red
Had to go through one of your competitors
Hope you don't mind
Wanted it to be a surprise
It's very pretty, Andy
Thank you
You gonna play something
-- Red considers it, shakes his head
Softly: Not today
153	 --  /'  --  (1957) 153 Men line the tiers as the evening count is completed
The convicts step into their cells
The master switch is thrown and all the doors slam shut -- -
Andy finds a cardboard tube on his bunk
The note reads: " new girl for your 10 year anniversary
From your pal
Red
" 154	 -- '  --  (1957) 154 Marilyn Monroe's face fills the screen
reveals the new poster: the famous shot from "The Seven Year Itch," on the subway grate with skirt billowing up
Andy sits gazing at her as lights-out commences
155	 -- '  --  (1957) 155 and we find Red gazing blankly as darkness takes the cellblock
Adding up the months, weeks, days
He regards the harmonica like a man confronted with a Martian artifact
He considers trying it out -- even holds it briefly to his lips, almost embarrassed -- but puts it back in its box untested
And there the harmonica will stay
156 	    as   grow louder
156 (
) Andy was as good as his word
He kept writing to the State Senate
Two letters a week instead of one
and the  disintegrates as a wall tumbles before our eyes, revealing a   with picks and sledgehammers, faces obscured outlaw-style with kerchiefs against the dust
Behind them are  overseeing the work
Andy yanks his kerchief down, grinning in exhilaration
Red and the others follow suit
They step through the hole in the wall, exploring what used to be a sealed-off storage room
(
) In 1959, the folks up Augusta way finally clued in to the fact they couldn't buy him off with just a 200 dollar check
Appropriations Committee voted an annual payment of 500 dollars, just to shut him up
157	 --   --  (1960) 157 the construction
Walls have been knocked down
Men are painting, plastering, hammering
Lots of shelves going up
Red is head carpenter
We find him discussing plans with Andy
(
) Those checks came once a year like clockwork
158	 --   --  (1960) 158 Red and the boys are opening boxes, pulling out books
(
) You'd be amazed how far Andy could stretch it
He made deals with book clubs, charity groups
he bought remaindered books by the pound
Treasure Island
Robert Louis
(jotting) Stevenson
Next
got here an auto repair manual, and a book on soap carving
Trade skills and hobbies, those go under educational
Stack right behind you
The Count of Monte Crisco
Cristo, you dumbshit
by Alexandree Dumb-ass
Dumas
You boys'll like that one
It's about a prison break
Floyd tries to take the book
Heywood yanks it back
saw it first
Red shoots Andy a look
Maybe that should go under educational too
159	 --   --  (1961) 159 Red is making a sign, carefully routing letters into a long plank of wood
It turns out to be -- 160	 --   --  (1963) 160 -- the varnished wood sign over the archway: "Brooks Hatlen Memorial Library
"   to reveal the library in all its completed glory: shelves lined with books, tables and chairs, even a few potted plants
Heywood is wearing headphones, listening to Hank Williams on the record player
(
) By the year Kennedy was shot, Andy had transformed a broom closet smelling of turpentine into the best prison library in New England
161	 --   --  (1963) 161 as Norton addresses    : (
) That was also the year Warden Norton instituted his famous "Inside-Out" program
You may remember reading about it
It made all the papers and got his picture in  magazine
a genuine, progressive advance in corrections and rehabilitation
Our inmates, properly supervised, will be put to work outside these walls performing all manner of public service
Cutting pulpwood, repairing bridges and causeways, digging storm drains
Red and the boys listening from behind the fence
These men can learn the value of an honest day's labor while providing a valuable service to the community -- and at a bare minimum of expense to Mr
and Mrs
John
Taxpayer
Sounds like road-gangin', you ask me
Nobody asked you
162	 --    --  (1963) 162 - is grading a culvert with picks
There's dust and the smell of sweat in the air
patrol with sniper rifles, pushy   in an ugly hat bustles up the grade, trailed by a
You there
You men
We're gonna take your picture now
Give us a break, lady
Don't you know who  am
'm from magazine
was told 'd get some co-operation out here
You want me to report you to your warden
Is that what you want
(sighs) No, ma'am
That's more like it
Now  want you all in a row with big bright smiles on your faces
Grab hold of your tools and show 'em to me
She turns, motioning her photographer up the grade
Heywood glances around at the other men
You heard the lady
Heywood unzips his pants, reaches inside
The others do likewise
The woman turns back and is greeted by the sight of a dozen men displaying their penises and smiling brightly
Her legs go wobbly and she sits heavily down on the dirt grade
'mon
We're showin' our tools and grinnin' like fools
Take the damn picture
163	 --   --  (1963) 163 Heywood sits alone in the dark
He sighs
(
) None of the inmates were invited to express their views
164	 --   --  (1965) 164 - is pulling stumps, bogged down in mud

) 'Course, Norton failed to mention to the press that "bare minimum of expense" is a fairly loose term
There are a hundred different ways to skim off the top
Men, materials, you name it
And, oh my Lord, how the money rolled in
Norton strolls into view with   at his heels
This keeps up, you're gonna put me out of business
With this pool of slave labor you got, you can underbid any contractor in town
Ned, we're providing a valuable community service
That's fine for the papers, but got a family to feed
The State don't pay my salary
Sam, we go back a long way
need this new highway contract
don't get it, go under
That's a fact
(hands him a box) Now you just have some'a this fine pie my missus baked specially for you, and you think about that
Norton opens the box
Alongside the pie is an envelope
He runs his thumb across the thick stack of cash it contains
, a winch cable  and whips through the air, damn near severing a man's leg
He goes down, screaming in mud and blood, pinned by a fallen tree stump
Men rush over to help him
Norton barely takes notice
Ned,  wouldn't worry too much over this contract
Seems to me 've already got my boys committed elsewhere
You be sure and thank Maisie for this fine pie
165	 -- '  --  (1965) 165 on Maisie's pie
Several pieces gone
(
) And behind every shady deal, behind every dollar earned
to Andy at the desk, munching thoughtfully as he totals up figures on an adding machine
(
) there was Andy, keeping the books
Andy finishes preparing two bank deposits
Norton hovers near the desk, keeping a watchful eye
Two deposits, Casco Bank and New England First
Night drop, like always
Norton pockets the envelopes
Andy crosses to the wall safe and shoves the ledger and sundry files inside
Norton locks the safe, swings his wife's framed sampler back into place
He cocks his thumb at some laundry and two suits in the corner
Get my stuff down t'laundry
Two suits for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot
Tell 'em if they over- starch my shirts again, they're gonna hear about it from me
(adjusts his tie) How do  look
Very nice
Big charity to-do up Portland way
Governor's gonna be there
(indicates pie) Want the rest of that
Woman can't bake worth shit
166	 --   --  (1965) 166 Andy trudges down the corridor with Norton's laundry, the pie box under his arm
167	 --  --  (1965) 167 to find Red munching away as he helps Andy sort books on the shelves
Got his fingers in a lot of pies, from what  hear
What you hear isn't half of it
He's got scams you haven't dreamed of
Kickbacks on his kickbacks
There's a river of dirty money flowing through this place
Money like that can be a problem
Sooner or later you gotta explain where it came from
That's where  come in
channel it, funnel it, filter it
stocks, securities, tax free municipals
send that money out into the big world
And when it comes back
It's clean as a virgin's whistle
Cleaner
By the time Norton retires, will have made him a millionaire
Jesus
They ever catch on, he's gonna wind up wearing a number himself
(smiles) thought you had more faith in me than that
'm sure you're good, but all that paper leaves a trail
Anybody gets too curious -- , , whatever -- that trail's gonna lead to somebody
Sure it will
But not to me, and certainly not to the warden
Who then
Peter Stevens
Who
The silent, silent partner
He's the guilty one, your Honor
The man with the bank accounts
That's where the filtering process starts
They trace it back, all they're gonna find is him
Yeah, okay, but who the hell is he
phantom
An apparition
Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit
(off Red's look) conjured him out of thin air
He doesn't exist
except on paper
You can't just make a person up
Sure you can, if you know how the system works, and where the cracks are
It's amazing what you can accomplish by mail
Mr
Stevens has a birth certificate, social security card, driver's license
They ever track those accounts, they'll wind up chasing a figment of my imagination
Jesus
Did  say you were good
You're Rembrandt
It's funny
On the outside,  was an honest man
Straight as an arrow
had to come to prison to be a crook
168	 --   --  (1965) Does it ever bother you
don't run the scams, Red,  just process the profits
That's a fine line, maybe
But 've also built that library, and used it to help a dozen guys get their high school diplomas
Why do you think the warden lets me do all that
To keep you happy and doing the laundry
Money instead of sheets
work cheap
That's the trade-off
draw their attention to the main gate
It swings open, revealing a prison bus waiting outside
169	 --   --  (1965) 169 Among those on board is  , a damn good-looking kid in his mid-20's
The bus  through the gate
170	 --   --  (1965) 170 The new fish disembark, chained together single-file
The old- timers holler and shake the fence
deafening gauntlet
171	 --   --  (1965) 171 Tommy and the others are marched in naked and shivering, covered with delousing powder, greeted by  and
172	 -- '  --  (1965) 172 The bars slam with a
Tommy and his new take in their new surroundings
Well
Ain't this for shit
173	 --   --  (1965) 173 Tommy as he struts along, combing his ducktail, cigarette behind his ear
(We definitely need The Coasters or Del Vikings on the soundtrack here
Maybe Jerry Lee Lewis
) (
) Tommy Williams came to Shawshank in 1965 on a two year stretch for &
Cops caught him sneakin'  sets out the back door of a  Penney
174	 --   --  (1965) 174 slices ten-foot lengths of wood
Red runs the machine while some other - feed the wood
(
) Young punk, Mr
Rock n' Roll, cocky as hell
Tommy is hauling the cut wood off the conveyor and stacking it, It's a ball-busting job, but the kid's a blur
(slapping his gloves) 'mon there, old boys
Movin' like molasses
Makin' me look bad
The old guys just grin and shake their heads
(
) We liked him immediately
175	 --   --  (1965) 175 Tommy regales the old boys with his exploits: so 'm backin' out the door, right
Had the  like this
(mimes his grip) Big ol' thing
Couldn't see shit
Suddenly, here's this voice: Freeze kid
Hands in the air
Well  just stand there holdin' on to that , so the voice says: "You hear what  said, boy
" And  say, Yes sir,  sure did
But if  drop this fuckin' thing, you got me on destruction of property too
The whole table falls about laughing
176	 --  --  (1965) 176 Poker game in progress
Tommy, Andy, Red and the boys
You did a stretch in Cashman too
Yeah
That was an easy ride, let me tell you
Work programs, weekend furloughs
Not like here
Sounds like you done time all over New England
Been in and out since  was 13
Name the place, chances are  been there
Perhaps it's time you considered a new profession
(the game stalls) What  mean is, you don't seem to be a very good thief
Maybe you should try something else
What the hell you know about it, Capone
What are you in for
(wry glance to Red) Everyone's innocent in here
Don't you know that
The tension breaks
Everyone laughs
177	 -- '  --  (1965) 177 the room
Chaotic
are waiting their turn or talking to visitors through a thick plexi shield
(
) As it turns out, Tommy had himself a young wife and new baby girl
Tommy's at the end of the row, phone to his ear
Other side of the glass is , near tears, fussing with a  on her lap
said we can stay with them, but Joey's gettin' out of the service next month, and they barely got enough room as it is
Plus they got Poppa workin' double shifts and the baby cries half the night
just don't know where we're gonna go
on Tommy's face as he listens
(
) Maybe it was the thought of them on the streets
or his child growing up not knowing her daddy
178	 --  --  (1965) 178 Tommy enters, the strut gone from his step
little scared
He finds Andy filing library cards
(
) Whatever it was, something lit a fire under that boy's ass
'm thinkin' maybe  should try for high school equivalency
Hear you helped some fellas with that
don't waste time on losers, Tommy
(tight) ain't no goddamn loser
That's a good start
If we do this, we do it all the way
One hundred percent
Nothing half-assed
Tommy thinks about it, nods
Thing is, see
(leans in, mutters) don't read all that good
(smiles) Well
You've come to the right place then
179	 --  --  (1965) 179 We find Andy giving an impassioned reading: and the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor
and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor, shall be lifted nevermore
" Andy slaps the book shut, immensely pleased with himself
So this raven just sits there and won't go away
That's right
(beat) Why don't that fella get hisself a 12-gauge and dust the fucker
180	 --  --  (1965) 180 Tommy tries to read as Andy looks on: The cat sh--The cat shh
(glances up) The cat shat on the welcome mat
Andy shakes his head
Not exactly
181	 --  --  (1965) 181 Andy chalks the alphabet on a blackboard
(
) So Andy took Tommy under his wing
Started walking him through his ABCs
182	 --   --  (1965) 182 the table to Tommy and Andy
Discussing a book
(
) Tommy took to it pretty well, too
Boy found brains he never knew he had
183	 --    --  (1965) 183 The cat sh--shh--shimmied up the tree and crept st--stel--stealthily out on the limb
184	 --   --  (1965) 184 Tommy intent on a paperback, mouthing the words
Behind him, wood is piling up on the conveyor belt
(
) After a while, you couldn't pry those books out of hands
Ass in gear, son
You're putting us behind
Tommy shoves the book in his back pocket and hurries over
185	 --  --  (1965) 185 Tommy writes a sentence on the blackboard
Andy steps in, shows him how to reconstruct it
(
) Before long, Andy started him on his course requirements
He really liked the kid, that was part of it
Gave him a thrill to help a youngster crawl off the shitheap
But that wasn't the only reason
186	 -- '  --  (1966) 186 on chessboard
Most of the pieces complete Andy lying in his bunk, carefully polishing
(
) Prison time is slow time
Sometimes it feels like stop-time
So you do what you can to keep going
and we keep going past Andy in a   of the cell
Sink
Toilet
Books
Outside the window bars, we hear another passing in the night
(
) Some fellas collect stamps
Others build matchstick houses
Andy built a library
Now he needed a new project
Tommy was it
It was the same reason he spent years shaping and polishing those rocks
The same reason he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall
, past a chair, a sweater on a hook
and finally to the place of honor on the wall
(
) In prison, a man'll do most anything to keep his mind occupied
where the latest poster turns out to be Racquel Welch ins fur bikini
Gorgeous
"One Million Years,
"   , (
) By 1966
right about the time Tommy was getting ready to take his exams
it was lovely Racquel
187	 --  --  (1966) 187 Tommy's taking the big test
Andy's monitoring the time
Deep silence, save for Tommy's pencil-scribbling
few old-timers are browsing the shelves, sneaking looks their way
Tommy tries to ignore them
Concentrate
Andy clears his throat
Time's up
Tommy puts his pencil down, Well
Well
It's for shit
(gets up in disgust) Wasted a whole fuckin' year of my time with this bullshit
May not be as bad as you think
It's worse
didn't get a fuckin' thing right
Might as well be in Chinese
We'll see how the score comes out
'll tell you how the goddamn score comes out
Tommy grabs the test, wads it, slam-dunks it into the trash
Two points
Right there
There's your goddamn score
(storms out) Goddamn cats crawlin' up trees, 5 times 5 is 25, fuck this place, fuck it
Tommy is gone
Red and others stare
Andy gets up, pulls the test from the trash, smoothes it out on the desk
188	 --   --  (1966) 188 Rest break
Tommy and Red sipping Cokes
feel bad
let him down
That's crap, son
He's proud of you
Proud as a hen
(off Tommy's look) We been friends a long time
know him as good as anybody
Smart fella, ain't he
Smart as they come
Used to be a banker on the outside
What's he in for anyway
Murder
The hell you say
You wouldn't think, lookin' at him
Caught his wife in bed with some golf pro
Greased 'em both
'mon, boy, back to work
Red turns back
Tommy's Coke has slipped from his hand and shattered on the floor
The kid's gone white as a sheet
(bare whisper) Oh my God
189	 --  --  (1966) 189 Tommy sits before Andy and Red: 'Bout four years ago,  was in Thomaston on a 2 to 3 stretch
Stole a car
Dumbfuck thing to do
(beat) Few months left to go,  get a new cellmate in
Elmo Blatch
Big twitchy fucker
Crazy eyes
Kind of roomie you pray you don't get, know what 'm sayin'
6 to 12 for armed burglary
Said he done hundreds of jobs
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was
Cut a loud fart, he'd go three feet in the air
Talked all the time, too, that's the other thing
Never shut up
Places he'd been, jobs he pulled, women he fucked
Even people he killed
People that gave him shit, that's how he put it
One night, like a joke,  say: "Yeah
Who'd you kill
" So he says
got me this job one time bussin' tables at a country club
So  could case all the big rich pricks that come in
pick out this guy, go in one night and do his place
He wakes up and gives me shit
So  killed him
Him and the tasty bitch he was with
(starts laughing) That's the best part
She's fuckin' this prick, see, this golf pro, but she's married to some other guy
Some hotshot banker
He's the one they pinned it on
They got him down-Maine somewhere doin' time for the crime
Ain't that choice
He throws his head back and  with laughter
191	 --   --  (1966) 191 Silence
Tommy has finished his story
Red is stunned
but Andy looks like he's been smacked with a two by four
Andy
Andy says nothing
Walks stiffly away
Doesn't look back
192	 -- '  --  (1966) 192 Well
have to say, that's the most amazing story  ever heard
What amazes me most is you were taken in by it
Sir
It's obvious this fellow Williams is impressed with you
He hears your tale of woe and quite naturally wants to cheer you up
He's young, not terribly bright
Not surprising he didn't know what a state he'd put you in
think he's telling the truth
Let's say for a moment Blatch does exist
You think he'd just fall to his knees and cry, "Yes,  did it
confess
By all means, please add a life term to my sentence
" It wouldn't matter
With Tommy's testimony,  can get a new trial
That's assuming Blatch is even still there
Chances are excellent he'd be released by now
Excellent
They'd have his last known address
Names of relatives
(Norton shakes his head) Well it's a chance
isn't it
How can you be so obtuse
What
What did you call me
Obtuse
Is it deliberate
The country club will have his old time cards
-2s with his name on them
(rises) Dufresne, if you want to indulge this fantasy, that's your business
Don't make it mine
This meeting's over
Look, if it's the squeeze, don't worry
'd never say what goes on in here
'd be just as indictable as you for laundering the money
Don't you ever mention money to me again, you sorry son of a bitch
Not in this office, not anywhere
(slaps intercom) Get in here
Now
was just trying to rest your mind at ease, that's all
(as  enter) Solitary
month
Andy gets dragged away, kicking and screaming: What's the matter with you
It's my chance to get out, don't you see that
It's my life
Don't you understand it's my life
193	 --   --  (1966) 193 Mail call
Men crowd around as names are called out
Red and the boys are parked on the bleachers
month in the hole
Longest damn stretch  ever heard of
It's my fault
Like hell
You didn't pull the trigger, and you didn't convict him
Red
You saying Andy's innocent mean for real innocent
(Red nods) Sweet Jesus
How long's he been in here
Since '47
Going on nineteen years
Thomas Williams
Tommy raises his hand
The envelope gets tossed to him
He stares at it
Red peers over his shoulder
Board of Education
The son of a bitch mailed it
Looks that way
You gonna open it or stick your thumb up your butt
Thumb up my butt sounds better
He gets hemmed in by the older men
Red snatches the letter
'mon, just throw it away
Will you please
Just throw it away
Red rips it open, scans the letter
Expressionless
Well, shit
194	 -- '  --  (1966) 194 Tommy makes his way through the chaos, finds Beth and the baby waiting behind the thick plexi shield
He sits, doesn't pick up the phone
Just stares at Beth
She doesn't know what to make of it
He presses a piece of paper against the glass
high school diploma
Her face lights up, blinking back tears
195	 --   --  (1966) 195 on steel door
Somewhere behind it, unseen, is Andy, rat scurries along the wall
approach slowly
196	 --  --  (1966) 196 Andy listens in darkness
The  pause outside his door
The slot opens
An   peers in
Kid passed
-plus average
Thought you'd like to know
The slot closes
The  recede
Andy smiles
197	 --   --  (1966) 197 We find Tommy on evening work detail, mopping the floors with bucket and pail
Mert Entwhistle comes into view
Warden wants to talk
198	 --  --  (1966) 198 steel door rattles open
Mert leads Tommy outside to a gate, unlocks it
Tommy looks around
Out here
That's what the man said
Mert swings the gate open, sends Tommy through, turns and heads back inside
Tommy proceeds out across a loading-dock access for the shops and mills
Some vehicles parked
The place is deserted
He stops, sensing a presence
Warden
Norton steps into the light
Tommy, we've got a situation here
think you can appreciate that
Yes sir,  sure can
tell you, son, this really came along and knocked my wind out
It's got me up nights, that's the truth
Norton pulls a pack of cigarettes, offers Tommy a smoke
Tommy takes one
Norton lights both cigarettes, pockets his lighter
The right decision
Sometimes it's hard to figure out what that is
You understand
(Tommy nods) Think hard, Tommy
If 'm gonna move on this, there can't be the least little shred of doubt
have to know if you what you told Dufresne was the truth
Yes sir
Absolutely
Would you be willing to swear before a judge and jury
having placed your hand on the Good Book and taken an oath before Almighty God Himself
Just gimme that chance
That's what  thought
Norton drops his cigarette
Crushes it out with the toe of his shoe
Glances up toward the plate shop roof as -- 199 	      ( ) 199 -- a rifle scope pops up into frame, jumping Tommy's image into startling magnification, framed in the crosshairs
200 	  200 rapid-fires a carbine --
-- his face lit up by the muzzle flashes
Captain Hadley
201 	 201 gets chewed to pieces by the gunfire
He smacks the ground in a twitching, thrashing heap
Eyes wide and staring
Dead
Surprise still stamped on his face
Silence now
Norton turns, strolls into darkness
202	 --   --  (1966) 202 approach Andy's cell
The door is unlocked
Andy emerges slowly, blinking painfully at the light
203 / --  --  (1966) 203 Andy is marched along
Convicts stop to stare
204	 -- '  --  (1966) 204 Andy is led in
The door is closed
Alone with Norton
Softly, Terrible thing
Man that young, less than a year to go, trying to escape
Broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him, truly it did
'm done
It stops right now
Get & Block to declare your income
Norton lunges to his feet, eyes sparkling with rage
Nothing stops
(tight) Or you will do the hardest time there is
No more protection from the guards
'll pull you out of that one-bunk Hilton and put you in () (cont
) with the biggest bull queer  can find
You'll think you got fucked by a train
And the library
Gone
Sealed off brick by brick
We'll have us a little book-barbecue in the yard
They'll see the flames for miles
We'll dance around it like wild Indians
Do you understand me
Are you catching my drift
on Andy's face
Eyes hollow
His beaten expression says it all
205	 --   --  (1966) 205 Red finds Andy sitting in the shadow of the high stone wall, poking listlessly through the dust for small pebbles
Red waits for some acknowledgment
Andy doesn't even look up
Red hunkers down and joins him
Nothing is said for the longest time
And then, softly: My wife used to say 'm a hard man to know
Like a closed book
Complained about it all the time
(pause) She was beautiful
loved her
But guess  couldn't show it enough
(softly) killed her, Red
Andy finally glances to Red, seeking a reaction
Silence
didn't pull the trigger
But drove her away
That's why she died
Because of me, the way  am
That don't make you a murderer
Bad husband, maybe
Andy smiles faintly in spite of himself
Red gives his shoulder a squeeze
Feel bad about it if you want
But you didn't pull the trigger
No
didn't
Someone else did, and wound up here
Bad luck,  guess
Bad luck
Jesus
It floats around
Has to land on somebody
Say a storm comes through
Some folks sit in their living rooms and enjoy the rain
The house next door gets torn out of the ground and smashed flat
It was my turn, that's all
was in the path of the tornado
(softly) just had no idea the storm would go on as long as it has
(glances to him) Think you'll ever get out of here
Sure
When  got a long white beard and about three marbles left rolling around upstairs
Tell you where 'd go
Zihuatanejo
Zihuatanejo
Mexico
Little place right on the Pacific
You know what the Mexicans say about the Pacific
They say it has no memory
That's where 'd like to finish out my life, Red warm place with no memory
Open a little hotel right on the beach
Buy some worthless old boat and fix it up like new
Take my guests out charter fishing
(beat) You know, a place like that, 'd need a man who can get things
Red stares at Andy, laughs
Jesus, Andy
couldn't hack it on the outside
Been in here too long
'm an institutional man now
Like old Brooks Hatlen was
You underestimate yourself
Bullshit
In here 'm the guy who can get it for you
Out there, all you need are Yellow Pages wouldn't know where to begin
(derisive snort) Pacific Ocean
Hell
Like to scare me to death, somethin' that big
Not me
didn't shoot my wife and didn't shoot her lover, and whatever mistakes  made 've paid for and then some
That hotel and that boat
don't think it's too much to want
To look at the stars just after sunset
Touch the sand
Wade in the water
Feel free
Goddamn it, Andy, stop
Don't do that to yourself
Talking shitty pipedreams
Mexico's down there, and you're in here, and that's the way it is
You're right
It's down there, and 'm in here
guess it comes down to a simple choice, really
Get busy living or get busy dying
Red snaps a look
What the hell does that mean
Andy rises and walks away
Red lunges to his feet
Andy
(turns back) Red, if you ever get out of here, do me a favor
There's this big hayfield up near Buxton
You know where Buxton is
(nods) Lots of hayfields there
One in particular
Got a long rock wall with a big oak at the north end
Like something out of a Robert Frost poem
It's where  asked my () (cont
) wife to marry me
We'd gone for a picnic
We made love under that tree
asked and she said yes
(beat) Promise me, Red
If you ever get out, find that spot
In the base of that wall you'll find a rock that has no earthly business in a Maine hayfield
piece of black volcanic glass
You'll find something buried under it  want you to have
What
What's buried there
You'll just have to pry up that rock and see
Andy turns and walks away
206	 --   --  (1966) tell you, the man was talkin' crazy
'm worried,  truly am
We ought to keep an eye on him
That's fine, during the day
But at night he's got that cell all to himself
Oh Lord
Andy come down to the loading dock today
Asked me for a length of rope
Six foot long
Shit
You gave it to him
Sure  did
mean why wouldn't
Christ
Remember Brooks Hatlen
How the hell was  s'pose to know
Andy'd never do that
Never
They all look to Red
Every man's got a breaking point
207	 --   --
--  (1966) 207 (over
) Report to your cellblocks for evening count
to Red and the boys
Convicts drift past them
Where the hell is he
Probably still up in the warden's
(via bullhorn) Christ
What do we do
Nothing we can do
Not tonight
Let's pull him aside tomorrow, all of us
Have a word with him
Ain't that right, Red
(unconvinced) Yeah
Sure
That's right
20B	 -- '  --  (1966) 208 Andy's working away
Norton pokes his head in
Lickety-split
wanna get home
Just about done, sir
We follow Norton to his wife's sampler
He swings it aside, works the combination dial, opens the wall safe
Andy moves up, shoves in the black ledger and files
Norton shuts the safe
Three deposits tonight
Andy hands him the envelopes
Norton heads for the door
Get my stuff down t'laundry
And shine my shoes
want 'em lookin' like mirrors
(pauses at door) Nice havin' you back, Andy
Place just wasn't the same without you
Norton exits
Andy turns to the laundry
He opens the shoebox
Nice pair of dress shoes inside
He sighs, glances down at the old ragged pair of work shoes on his own feet
209	 -- '  --  (1966) 209 Andy is diligently shining Norton's shoes
210	 --   --  (1966) 210 Andy trudges down the hallway, laundry slung over his shoulder, 211	 --   --  (1966) 211 Andy nods to the
The guard  him through
212	 -- '  --  (1966) 212 Red hears Andy coming, moves to the bars
He watches Andy come up to the second tier and pause before his cell
(
) Open number twelve
Andy gazes directly at Red
beat of eye contact
Red shakes his head
Don't do it
Andy smiles, eerily calm
and enters his cell
The door closes
-
We hold on Red's face
213	 -- '  --  (1966) 213 Andy is polishing a chess piece
(
) Lights out
The lights bump off
He finishes polishing, holds up the piece to admire
pawn
He sets it down with the others -- and we realize it's the final glance for the board
full set
He gazes up at Racquel and smiles
Pulls a six foot length of rope from under his pillow
Lets it uncoil to the floor
214	 -- '  --  (1966) 214 Red sits in the dark, a bundle of nerves, trying to hold himself still
He feels like he might scream or shake to pieces
The seconds tick by, each an eternity
(
) have had some long nights in stir
Alone in the dark with nothing but your thoughts, time can draw out like a blade
outside his window sends harsh barred shadows jittering across the cell
storm breaking
(
) That was the longest night of my life
215	 --   --  (1966) 215 -
The master lock is thrown
The cons emerge from their cells and the headcount begins
Red looks back to see if Andy's in line
He's not
Suddenly the count stalls: Man missing on tier two
Cell 12
The head bull, , checks his list: Dufresne
Get your ass out here, boy
You're holding up the show
(no answer) Don't make me come down there now
'll thump your skull for you
Still no answer
Glaring, Haig stalks down the tier, clipboard in hand
His men fall in behind
Dufresne, dammit, you're putting me behind
You better be sick or dead in there,  shit you not
They arrive at bars
Their faces go slack
Stunned
Softly: Oh my Holy God
216 	  216 reveals the cell is empty
Everything neat and tidy
Even the bunk is stowed
They wrench the door open and rush in, tossing the cell in a panic as if Andy might be lurking under the Kleenex or the toothpaste
on Haig as he spins toward us, bellowing at the top of his lungs: 217	 -- '  --  (1966) 217 Norton is kicking back with the morning paper
He notices ha dingy his shoes are
He glances at the shoebox on the desk
kicks his shoes off, opens the box -- and gulls out Andy's o grimy work shoes
He stares blankly
What the fuck indeed
An    throughout the prison
He looks up
218	 --  --  (1966) 218 Norton and Hadley stride across the grounds,
want every man on that cellblock questioned
Start with that friend of his
who
219	 --   -- '  --  (1966) 219 Red watches as Norton storms up with an entourage of guards
Him
Red's eyes widen
Guards yank him from his cell
220	 -- '  --  (1966) 220 Norton steps to the center of the room, working himself up into a fine rage: What do you mean "he just wasn't here
" Don't say that to me, Haig
Don't say that to me again
But sir
He wasn't
He isn't
can see that, Haig
You think 'm blind
Is that what you're saying
Am  blind, Haig
No sir
Norton grabs the clipboard and thrusts it at Hadley
What about you
You blind
Tell me what this is
Last night's count
You see Dufresne's name
sure do
Right there, see
"Dufresne
" He was in his cell at lights out
Stands to reason he'd still be here this morning
want him found
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast
Now
Haig scurries out, gathering men
Norton spins to Red
Well
Well what
see you two all the time, you're thick as thieves, you are
He must'a said something
No sir, he didn't
Norton spreads his arms evangelist-style, spins slowly around
Lord
It's a miracle
Man up and vanished like a fart in the wind
Nothin' left but some damn rocks on the windowsill and that cupcake on the wall
Let's ask her
Maybe she knows
What say there, Fuzzy- Britches
Feel like talking
Guess not
Why should you be different
Red exchanges looks with the guards
Even they're nervous
Norton scoops a handful rocks off the sill
He hurls them at the wall one at a time, shattering them, punctuating his words: It's a conspiracy
() That's what this is
() It's one big damn conspiracy
() And everyone's in on it
() Including her
He sends the last rock whizzing right at Racquel
No smash
It takes a moment for this to sink in
All eyes go to her
The rock went through her
There's a small hole in the poster where her navel used to be
You could hear a pin drop
Norton reaches up, sinks his finger into the hole
He keeps pushing
and his entire hand disappears into the wall
221 	    221 as Norton rips the poster from before our eyes
Stunned faces peer in
to reveal the long crumbling tunnel in the wall
222	 -- '  --   (1966) 222 , a guard barely out of his teens, tries not to look nervous as they lash a rope around his chest
He's getting instructions from six different people at once
(
) They got this skinny kid named Rory Tremont to go in the hole
He wasn't much in the brains department, but he possessed the one most important qualification for the job
(they slap a flashlight in his hands) he was willing to go
223	 --  --  (1966) 223 Rory squeezes down the tunnel on his belly
(
) Probably thought he'd win a Bronze Star or something
224	 --   --  (1966) 224 Dark as midnight
Concrete walls rise on both sides
If you imagine them as two huge slices of bread, the meat of this particular sandwich is about three feet of airspace and a dark tangle of pipes between the cellblocks
Rory's appears, shining his flashlight down the shaft
Somewhere, a rat
(
) It was his third day on the job
Warden
There's a space here between the walls 'bout three feet across
Smells pretty damn bad
(
) don't care what it smells like
(
) Go on, boy
We got a hold of you
Looking none too happy about it, Rory squeezes from the tunnel and dangles into the shaft
He gets lowered, shining his light, smothered by darkness
Not having a good time
Hoo-whee
Smell's gettin' worse
(
) Never mind,  said
Just keep going
Smells pretty damn bad, Warden
In fact, it smells just like shit
His feet touch the ground -- or what he assumed was the ground
It's not
In fact, it's just what it smells like
He sinks in past his ankles
He slips and sits heavily in it
Oh God, that's what it is, it's shit
oh my God it's shit
pull me out 'fore  blow my groceries, oh shit it's shit, oh my Gawwwwwwd
225	 -- '  --  (1966) 225 Red and others listen to violent barfing from below
(
) And then came the unmistakable sound of Rory Tremont losing his last few meals
The whole cellblock heard it
mean, it echoed
That's it for Red
He starts laughing
Laughing, hell, he's bellowing laughter, laughing so hard he has to hold himself, laughing so hard tears are pouring down his cheeks
The look of rage on Norton's face makes him laugh all the harder
226	 --   --  (1966) 226 Abrupt silence
on steel door
(
) laughed myself right into solitary
Two week stretch
227	 --  --  (1966) 227 It's shit, it's shit, oh my God it's shit
He starts laughing all over again, fit to split
(
) Andy once talked about doing easy time in the hole
Now  knew what he meant
228	 --   --   --  (1966) 228 Virgin landscape
Charming rural road
Suddenly, State Police cruisers rocket up the road with
(
) In 1966, Andy Dufresne escaped from Shawshank Prison
229	 --  --  (1966) 229 Shawshank is half a mile distant
a muddy creel as   and   scour the brush fishes a prison uniform out of the creek with a long stick
(
) All they found of him was a muddy set of prison clothes, a bar of soap, and an old rock-hammer damn near worn down to the nub
g2 pulls the rock-hammer from the weeds to a
His   produces: 230 	      230 of the hapless cops posing with Andy's reeking uniform and the worn rock-hammer
on the hammer
(
) remember thinking it would take a man six hundred years to tunnel through the wall with it
Andy did it in less than twenty
231	 -- '  --  (1949) 231 Once again, we see Andy using the rock-hammer to scratch his name into the cement
Suddenly, a palm-sized chunk of cement pops free and hits the floor
He stares down at it
232	 -- '  --  (1949) 232 Andy lies in the dark, studying the chunk of concrete in his hands
Considering the possibilities
Wrestling with hope
(
) Andy loved geology
imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature
An ice age here, a million years of mountain-building there, plates of bedrock grinding against each other over a span of millennia
233	 -- '  --  (1949) 233 Andy stands peering at the small hole left by the fallen chunk
Carefully runs his fingertip over it
(
) Geology is the study of pressure and time
That's all it takes, really
Pressure and time
234	 -- '  --  (1951) 234 Rita is now on the wall, hanging down over Andy's back
(
) That and a big damn poster
to reveal Andy scraping patiently at the concrete
(
) Like  said
In prison, a man'll do most anything to keep his mind occupied
He hears  approaching
He smoothes the poster down and dives into bed
strolls by a moment later, shining his flashlight into the cell
235	 --   --  (1953) 235 Andy strolls along, whistling softly, hands in both pockets
to his pantleg
Concrete grit trickles out
(
) It turns out Andy's favorite hobby was totin' his wall out into the exercise yard a handful at a time
236	 -- 2ND  --  (1962) 236 strolls the tier, shining his flashlight into the cells
He pauses at Andy's bars, playing the beam over the sleeping form huddled under the blankets
p37   ( INS1DE ' ) 237 We see what the guard doesn't: instead of Andy's head under the blanket, it's a wadded-up pillow
The flashlight plays across the cell, pinning Marilyn Monroe in a circle of light
238 	    238 The light illuminates her face through the paper
to reveal Andy lying in his tunnel, holding his breath
The light clicks off
The  move on
He gets back to work
(
) While the rest of us slept, Andy spent years workin' the nightshift
239	 --  --  (1965) 239 the shaft
Rats scurry the pipes
Suddenly, r piece of concrete the size of a quarter jumps free and plummets down the shaft as the rock-hammer pushes through
The pick withdraws, replaced by Andy's peering eye
240 	    (1965 through 1966) 240 takes us through the widening of the hole
First as big as a tea cup
Then a saucer
Then a dinner plate
(
) Probably took him most of a year just to get his head through
Andy finally gets his head through, scraping his ears
He's got a penlight clenched in his teeth
He peers down into the shaft
At the very bottom, maybe 20 feet down, a big ceramic pipe runs the length of the cellblock
Beneath its coat of grime and dust, the word "" is stenciled
241	 --    --  (1966) 241 Below us, Tommy Williams lies facedown at Norton's feet
Blood is spreading, fanning out oa the pavement
Norton turns, strolls out of frame
(
) guess after Tommy was killed, Andy decided he'd been here just about long enough
Again we see: Andy working
Norton pokes his head in
Lickety-split
wanna get home
Just about done, sir
Norton crosses to the wall safe and works the dial, his back turned
This time, though, we stay on Andy: He pulls up his sweater, yanks out a large black book and a stack of files, lays them on the desk
He then grabs the real ledger and files, jams them down his pants and smoothes his sweater down
He picks up the bogus stack, crosses to Norton, and shoves everything in
243	 --  --  (1966) 243 Norton exits his office and strolls off whistling
on the open door
We see Andy at the guard's desk, pulling Norton's dress shoes from their box
(
) Andy did like he was told
Buffed those shoes to a high mirror shine
244	 -- '  --   (1966) 244 Andy sorts through Norton's three suits
He pauses, checking the gray pinstripe
Nice
245	 --   --  (1966) 245 The guard  Andy through
Andy walks toward us
(
) The guard simply didn't notice
Neither did
mean, seriously, how often do you really look at a man's shoes
as he passes by
Yep, he's wearing Norton's shoes
246	 -- '  --  (1966) 246 The lights go out
Andy places the last chess piece
Gazes up at Racquel
Smiles
Pulls the rope from under his pillow
He stands and unbuttons his prison shirt, revealing Norton's gray pinstripe suit underneath
floods the cell, throwing wild shadows
247	 -- '  --  (1966) 247 The storm rages
Andy, naked, carefully slips Norton's folded suit into a large industrial Zip-Lock bag
Next to go in are the shoes, chess pieces (already in a smaller bag), black ledger en files
Last but not least, a bar of soap wrapped in a towel
248	 --  --  (1966) 248 Andy, again wearing prison clothes, inches down the tunnel
249	 --  --  (1966) 249 Andy squeezes through the hole head-first, emerges to the waist, He reaches for the opposite wall, manages to snag a steel conduit with his fingers
Suddenly, a huge rat darts for his hand
Andy yanks away and almost plummets head-first down the shaft
He dangles wildly upside-down for a moment, arms windmilling, then gets his hands pressed firmly against the opposite wall
The rat scurries off, pissed
Andy snags the conduit again
He contorts out of the hole and dangles into the shaft
We now see the purpose for the rope: the plastic bag hangs from his ankle with about two feet of slack, He kicks his legs across the shaft, gets his feet braced
Wit3 his back against one wall and feet against the other, he starts down the shaft
Sliding dangerously
Using pipes for handholds
Flinching as rats dart this way and that, scurrying in the shadows
He drops the last few feet to the bottom
He approaches the ceramic sewer pipe and kneels before it
Pulls out the rock-hammer and says a quick silent prayer
Raises the rock-hammer high and swings it down with all his might
Once, twice -- third time lucky
An enormous eruption of sewage cascades into the air as if rocket-propelled, the Mount St
Helens of shit
Andy is instantly coated black
He turns away and heaves his guts out
The shit keeps coming
250	 --   --  (1966) 250 Andy peers down through the hole, playing his penlight aroun5, The inside diameter is no more than two feet
Tight squeeze
Coated with crud
It seems to go on for miles
No turning back
He wriggles into the pipe and starts crawling, plastic bag dragging behind
(
) Andy crawled to freedom through five hundred yards of shit-smelling foulness  can't even imagine
Or maybe  just don't want to
251	 --  --  (1966) 251 Rain is falling in solid sheets
Shawshank is half a mile distant
to reveal the creek
and   toward the mouth of the sewer pipe that feeds into it
(
) Five hundred yards
The length of five football fields
Just shy of half a mile
Fingers appear, thrusting through the heavy-gauge wire mesh covering the mouth of the pipe
Andy's face looms from the darkness, peering out at freedom
He wrenches the mesh loose, pushes himself out, and plunges head-first into the creek
He comes up sputtering for breath
The water is waist-deep
He wades upstream, ripping his clothes from his body
He gets his shirt off, spins it through the air over his head, flings the shirt away
He raises his arms to the sky, turning slowly, feeling the rain washing him clean
Exultant
Triumphant arcs from horizon to horizon
252	 -- '  --  (1966) 252 Once again, we see stunned faces as
(
) The next morning, right about the time Racquel was spilling her little secret
253	 --     --  (1966) 253 The door opens
Spit-shined shoes enter
the shoes to the counter
(
) a man nobody ever laid eyes on before strolled into the Casco Bank of Portland
Until that moment, he didn't exist -- except on paper
(
) May  help you
to Andy
Smiling in Norton's gray pinstripe suit
My name is Peter Stevens
've come to close out some accounts
254	 --  --   (1966) 254 The teller is cutting a cashier's check while the carefully examines Mr
Stevens' various
s
(
) He had all the proper
Driver's license, birth certificate, social security card
The signature was a spot-on match
must say 'm sorry to be losing your business
hope you'll enjoy living abroad
Thank you
'm sure  will
Here's your cashier's check, sir
Will there be anything else
Please
Would you add this to your outgoing mail
He hands her a package, stamped and addressed
Gives them a pleasant smile
Turns and strolls from the bank
(
) Mr
Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks in the Portland area that morning
All told, he blew town with better than 370 thousand dollars of Warden Norton's money
Severance pay for nineteen years
255	 --  --  (1966) 255 in shirtsleeves is going through the mail on his desk
He finds Andy's package, rips it open
Pulls out the black ledger and files
Scans a cover letter
Holy shit
He dashes to his door and yanks it open, revealing the words on the glass: "   -- Editor In Chief
" Hal
Dave
Get your butts in here
256	 --   --  (1966) 256 Norton walks slowly toward his office
Dazed
The morning paper in his hand
He goes wordlessly past the   into his office
Shuts the door
Lays the paper on his desk
The headline reads: "
" Below that, the sub-headline: "
Has Ledger
Indictments Expected
" Norton looks up as   in the distance

The title page is inscribed by hand: "Dear Warden
You were right
Salvation lay within
" Norton flips to the center of the book -- and finds the pages hollowed out in the shape of a rock-hammer
259	 --  --  (1966) 259 Police cruisers everywhere

jostle for position
colorless   steps forward into , flanked by a contingent of
Byron Hadley
to reveal Captain Hadley
Staring
Waiting
You have the right to remain silent
If you give up that right, anything you say will be used against you in court
move in, cuffing Hadley's hands behind his back
The drones on
Hadley says nothing
His face scrunches up
He begins to cry
(
) wasn't there to see it, but  hear Byron Hadley was sobbing like a little girl when they took him away
Hadley sobs all the way to the car
The
snaps a gaze up toward Norton's window, motions his men to follow
260	 -- '  --  (1966) 260 Norton is staring out the window as they approach the building
He goes to his desk, opens a drawer
Inside lies a revolver and a box of shells
(
) Norton had no intention of goin' that quietly
261	 --   --  (1966) 261 The
marches along amidst a phalanx of
262	 -- '  --  (1966) 262 Norton sits blankly at his desk, revolver before him
The doorknob rattles, a  is heard: (
) Samuel Norton
We have a warrant for your arrest
Open up
The  starts
Norton dumps the box of bullets out on thr desk
He starts sorting them to see which ones he likes
263 	   263 Troopers hustle the hapless duty guard to Norton's door as he fumbles nervously with a huge key ring
'm not sure which one it is
He starts trying keys in the lock
And as the keys go sliding in one after another
264	 -- '  --  (1966) 264 so do the bullets
Norton is riveted to the door
For every key, he loads another bullet
Methodical and grim
He gets the final bullet in just as the right key slams home
The door bursts open
Men muscle in
Somebody
Troopers dive in all directions as Norton raises the gun -- -- and jams it under his chin
his head snaps back as the wall goes red
His swivel chair does a slow half-turn and creaks to a final stop
Troopers rise slowly, gazing in horror
(
) like to think the last thing that went through his head
other than that bullet
was to wonder how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him
to the wall to reveal Mrs
Norton's framed sampler trickling blood and brains
and we get our final Bible lesson for today: "
" 265	 --   --  (1966) 265 Mail call
Red hears his name
They pass him a postcard
(
) Not long after the warden deprived us of his company,  got a postcard in the mail
It was blank
But the postmark said, "McNary, Texas
" 266	 --  --  (1966) 266 Red sits with an atlas, tracing his finger down the page
(
) McNary
Right on the border
That's where Andy crossed
(shuts the book) When  picture him heading south in his own car with the top down, it makes me laugh all over again
267	 --  --  --  (1966) 267 red convertible rips along with Andy at the wheel, cigar jutting from his grin, warm wind fluttering his tie
(
) Andy Dufresne, who crawled through a river of shit and came out clean on the other side
Andy Dufresne, headed for the Pacific
268	 --   --  (1966) 268 Heywood is regaling the table with some anecdote about Andy
(
) Those of us who knew him best talk about him often
swear, the stuff he pulled
It always makes us laugh
wild burst of laughter
on Red
Feeling melancholy
(
) Sometimes it makes me sad, though, Andy being gone
have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged, that's all
Their feathers are just too bright
269	 --  --   (1966) 269 Convicts hoe the fields
Guards patrol on horseback
(
) and when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice
but still, the place you live is that much more drab and empty that they're gone
Red pauses, gazes off
Storm clouds coming in, backlit by the sun
light drizzle begins
(
) guess  just miss my friend
270	 --   --  (1966) 270 Red is sleeping
He wakes with a start
(
) But there are times  curse him for the dreams he left behind
He senses a presence, looks over his shoulder
There's a Rita Hayworth poster on his wall
He gets out of bed
Rita just keeps smiling, inscrutable
As Red watches, a brilliant round glow builds behind the poster, shining from the tunnel
The poster rips free, charred to ash in the blink of an eye as a shaft of holy white light stabs into the cell
Sunlight
Red staggers back against the glare
whirlwind kicks up, whipping everything into the air
The hole in the wall is like a giant vacuum cleaner -- papers, book, toiletries, bedding -- if it ain't nailed down, it gets sucked down the hole toward the light
Red fights it, but the suction drags him closer and closer
271 	'  271 and  rockets into the hole, getting sucked down an endless tunnel at impossible speed, the  of air mixing with his drawn-out , closer and closer to the light
and erupting out the other side into total silence and a beautiful white beach
The Pacific Ocean before us
Enormous
Mind-blowing
Beautiful beyond description
All we hear now are the gentle sound of waves
(
) dreams where  am lost in a warm place with no memory
lone figure stands at water's edge
, coming up behind him and   to reveal -- Red
(
) An ocean so big it strikes me dumb
Waves so quiet they strike me deaf
Sunshine so bright it strikes me blind
It is a place that is blue beyond reason
Bluer than can possibly exist
Bluer than my mind can possibly grasp
272 	  272 Nothing for a million miles but beach, sky, and water
Red is a tiny speck at water's edge
Just another grain of sand
(
) am terrified
There is no way home
273	 -- '  --  (1966) 273 Red wakes from the nightmare
He gets out of bed
Moves to the barred window of his cell
Peers up at the stars
(
) Andy
know you're in that place
Look at the stars for me just after sunset
Touch the sand
wade in the water
and feel free
274 	 -  274 slides open with an enormous
stark room beyond
through
sit at a long table
An empty chair faces them
We are again in: --    --  (1967) Red enters, sits
20 years older than when we first saw him
#1 Your file says you've served forty years of a life sentence
You feel you've been rehabilitated
Red doesn't answer
Just stares off
Seconds tick by
The parole board exchanges glances
Somebody clears his throat
#1 Shall  repeat the question
heard you
Rehabilitated
Let's see now
You know, come to think of it,  have no idea what that means
#2 Well, it means you're ready to rejoin society as a-- know what you think it means
Me, think it's a made-up word, a poli- tician's word
word so young fellas like you can wear a suit and tie and have a job
What do you really want to know
Am  sorry for what  did
- ----- g2 Well
are you
Not a day goes by  don't feel regret, and not because 'm in here or because you think  should look back on myself the way was
stupid kid who did that terrible crime
wish  could talk sense to him
Tell him how things are
But  can't
That kid's long gone, this old man is all that's left, and  have to live with that
(beat) Rehabilitated
That's a bullshit word, so you just go on ahead and stamp that form there, sonny, and stop wasting my damn time
Truth is,  don't give a shit
The parole board just stares
Red sits drumming his fingers
-- big rubber stamp  down -- and lifts away to reveal the word "" in red ink
275	 --   --  275 herald the opening of the main gate
It swings hugely open, revealing Red standing in his cheap suit, carrying a cheap bag, wearing a cheap hat
He walks out, still looking stunned
276	 --  --  276 Red rides the bus, clutching the seat before him, gripped by terror of speed and motion
277	 --   --   277 Red arrives at the Brewster, three stories high and even less to look at than it used to be
27B	 --  --   278 leads Red up the stairs toward the top floor
279	 -- '  --   279 Small, old, dingy
An arched window with a view of Congress Street
Traffic noise floats up
Red enters and pauses, staring up at the ceiling beam
Carved into the wood are the words: "Brooks Hatlen was here
" 280	 --   --  280 Loud
Jangling with  and
We find Red bagging groceries
Registers are humming, kids are shrieking
Red calls to the  : Sir
Restroom break sir
(motions him over) You don't need to ask me every time you go take a piss
Just go
Understand
28l	 --   --  281 Red steps to the urinal, stares at himself in the wall mirror
(
) Thirty years 've been asking permission to piss
can't squeeze a drop without say-so
strange east Indian guitar-whine begins
The Beatles
George Harrison's "Within You Without You
" 282	 --  --  282 which carries through as Red walks
People and traffic
He keeps looking at the women
An alien species
(
) Women, too, that's the other thing
forgot they were half the human race
There's women everywhere, every shape and size
find myself semi-hard most of the time, cursing myself for a dirty old man
stroll by in cut-offs and t-shirts
(
) Not a brassiere to be seen, nipples poking out at the world
Jeezus, pleeze-us
Back in my day, a woman out in public like that would have been arrested and given a sanity hearing
283	 --  --  283 Red finds the park filled with
Hanging out
Happening
Here's the source of the music: a radio gyrates to the Beatles, stoned, in her own world
(
) They're calling this the Summer of Love
Summer of Loonies, you ask me

The
is filling out his report
You staying out of the bars, Red
Yes sir
That  am
How you doing otherwise
Adjusting okay
Things got different out here
Tell me about it
Young punks protesting the war
You imagine
Even my own kid
Oughtta bust his fuckin' skull
Guess the world moved on
285	 --  --  285 Bagging groceries
underfoot
One points a toy gun at Red, pumping the trigger
Red focuses on the gun, listening to it -
Sparky wheel grinding
The kids get swept off by
Red starts bagging the next customer
on Red
Surrounded by  and
Feeling like the eye of a hurricane
People everywhere, whipping around him like a gale
Strange
Loud
Dizzying
It gets distorted and weird, slow and thick, pressing in on him from all sides
The noise level intensifies
The hollering of children deepens and distends into
He's in the grip of a major anxiety attack
Tries to shake himself out of it
Can't
Fumbles the final items into the bag
Walks away
Trying not to panic
Trying not to run
He makes his way through the store
Blinking sweat
He bumps into a lady's cart, mumbles an apology, keeps going
Breaks into a trot
Down the aisle, cut to the left, through the door into the back rooms, faster and faster, running now, slamming through a door marked "Employees Only" into -- 286	 --   --  286 -- where he slams the door and leans heavily against it, shutting everything out, breathing heavily
Alone now
He goes to the sink, splashes his face, tries to calm down
He can still hear them out there
They won't go away
He glances around the restroom
Small
Not small enough
He enters a stall
Locks the door
Puts the toilet lid down and sits on the john
Better
He can actually reach out and touch the walls now
They're close
Safe
Almost small enough
He draws his feet up so he can't be seen if somebody walks in
He'll just sit here for a while
Until he calms down
287	 --  --  287 Red is walking home
(
) There is a harsh truth to face
No way 'm gonna make it on the outside
He pauses at a pawnshop window
An array of handguns
(
) All  do anymore is think of ways to break my parole
The  appears at the glass, locking the door and flipping the sign:
288	 -- '  --  288 Red lies smoking in bed
Unable to sleep
(
) Terrible thing, to live in fear
Brooks Hatlen knew it
Knew it all too well
All  want is to be back where things make sense
Where won't have to be afraid all the time
He glances up at the ceiling beam
"Brooks Hatlen was here
" (
) Only one thing stops me
promise made to Andy
289	 --   --  289 pickup truck rattles up the road trailing dust and pulls to a stop
Red hops off the back, waves his thanks
The truck drives on
Red starts walking
a roadside sign:
290	 --   --  290 High white clouds in a blazing blue sky
The trees fiery with autumn color
Red walks the fields and back-roads, cheap compass in hand
Looking for a certain hayfield
291	 --  --  291 Walking
Searching
The day turning late
Red finds himself staring at a distant field
There's a long rock wall, like something out o f a Robert Frost poem
Big oak tree
Red checks his compass
North end
He crosses a dirt road into the field
292	 --  --  292 Red walks the long rock wall, nearing the tree
squirrel scolds him from a low branch, scurries up higher
Red studies the base of the wall
Nothing unusual here
Just a bunch of rocks set in stone
He sighs
Fool's errand
Turns to go
Something catches his eye
He walks back, squats, peering closer
Wets a fingertip and rubs a stone
layer of dust comes off
Volcanic glass
Gleaming black
He tries to get the rock out, anticipation growing
It won't come; it's too smooth
He pulls a pocketknife and levers the rock free
It tumbles at his feet, leaving a ragged hole
Red leans down and solves the mystery at last, staring at the object buried under the rock
Stunned
It's an envelope wrapped in plastic
Written on it is a single word: "Red
" Red pulls the envelope out and rises
He just stares at it for a while, almost afraid to open it
But open it he does
Inside is a smaller envelope and a letter
Red begins to read: (
) Dear Red
If you're reading this, you've gotten out
And if you've come this far, maybe you're willing to come a little further
You remember the name of the town, don't you
could use a good man to help me get my project on wheels
'll keep an eye out for you and the chessboard ready
(beat) Remember, Red
Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies
will be hoping that this letter finds you, and finds you well
Your friend
Andy
By now, tears are spilling silently down Red's cheeks
He opens the other envelope and fans out a stack of new fifty- dollar bills
Twenty of them
thousand dollars
293	 -- '  --  (1967) 293 Red is dressed in his suit
He finishes knotting his tie, puts his hat on
His bag is by the door
He takes one last look around
Only one thing left to do
He pulls a wooden chair to the center of the room and gazes up at the ceiling beam
(
) Get busy living or get busy dying
That is goddamn right
He steps up on the chair
It wobbles under his weight
294	 --  -- '  --  (1967) 294 The door opens
Red exits with his bag and heads down the stairs, leaving the door open
through, to the ceiling beam which reads: "Brooks Hatlen was here
" new message has been carved alongside the old: "So was Red
" 295	 --    --  (1967) 295 reveals a long line of people at the counter
(
) For the second time in my life, am guilty of committing a crime
brings us to Red, next in line, bag by his feet
(
) Parole violation
doubt they'll toss up any roadblocks for that
Not for an old crook like me
(steps up) McNary, Texas
296	 --   --  (1967) 296 gorgeous New England landscape whizzes by, fields and trees a blur of motion
to reveal a Greyhound Sceni- Cruiser barreling up the road, pulling abreast of us from window to window, passing faces
We finally come to Red gazing out at the passing landscape
(
) find  am so excited  can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head
think it is the excitement only a free man can feel, a free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain
297   297 past camera, dwindling to a mere speck on the horizon
(
) hope  can make it across the border
hope to see my friend and shake his hand
hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams
(beat) hope
298	 --  --    --  (1967) 298 distant boat lies on its side in the sand like an old wreck that's been left to rot in the sun
There's someone out there
299 	   299 is meticulously stripping the old paint and varnish by hand, face hidden with goggles and kerchief mask
Red appears b
g
, a distant figure walking out across the sand, wearing his cheap suit and carrying his cheap bag
The man on the boat pauses
Turns slowly around
Red arrives with a smile as wide as the horizon
The other man raises his goggles and pulls down his mask
Andy, of course
You look like a man who knows how to get things
'm known to locate certain things from time to time
Red shrugs off his jacket and picks up a sander
