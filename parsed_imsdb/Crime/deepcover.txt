Written by Michael Tolkin and Henry Bean Story by Michael Tolkin -  (1970) Rain
Christmas lights
rusted out '56 Lincoln rattles down the bleak boulevard
In it:  , an angry, black man in his late 20's, beside him his 10-year-old son, Joe Jr
stares out the window at passing: boarded buildings, whores with raincoats over their heads trying to flag down a john, a black Santa, a knot of drinkers
Breaking the silence: Your mother okay
Yes, sir
They stop at a light
Joe Stevens tries to furtively snort a little something
He spots Joe Jr
watching
(firm, without irony) Don't you do this shit, boy
Don't you ever fuckin' touch it, you hear me
Joe Jr
stares, silent; Joe Jr
's about to hit him
(continuing) You hear me, goddam it
The boy nods
Satisfied, Joe Sr
draws in the stuff
It makes him feel good, strong, worried and determined all at once
(continuing; charged up) What do you want for Christmas
don't know
(light changes; he accelerates) You don't know
You gotta know what you want, boy, if you ever expect to get it
sudden charm to his bravado
Joe Jr
smiles uncertainly
Joe Sr
grins back, pulls up in front of a liquor store
(continuing) Wait here
This won't take a minute
Joe Jr
doesn't notice or doesn't remark that his father, just before entering the store, draws a handgun from beneath his coat
The boy gazes dreamily at the street
The lunatic Black Santa marches by, ranting to himself ("Then the white man say
")
The   on the roof and windshield
Joe Jr
breathes on the glass, fogging the scene
From the store:
Joe Jr
looks that way
Another , then: His father comes out the door clutching money in one hand
He strides toward the car with a reckless pride
He doesn't notice: The liquor store door opens behind him
Joe Stevens' guts splatter onto the car windshield
look of terrible amazement; he sinks to his knees
Daddy
He jumps from the car, kneels by his father
The   (47, Slavic) drags the gun toward them, bleeding profusely
(enraged, almost to tears) Fuckin' niggers
fuckin' niggers
looks at the money in his hand: two 20's, two 5's
Fifty bucks
fifty goddam bucks
(looks up at his son) 'm sorry
He stuffs the blood-soaked bills in the boy's shirt pocket and dies
Joe Jr
looks up at
Bloody, nearly unconscious, he aims the shotgun at the boy who is too frightened to move
Please, Mister
The man dies on his feet
As he falls backward, he pulls the trigger, the  shattering the car windows
Cop cars  up
Uniformed cops leap out, guns drawn, survey the scene
Then one notices Joe Jr
, staring motionless at his father and the store owner, dead together : : -- but older, harder, colder
They're concentrating on a paper before him
: 17 - Hundreds of / questions

(/) We are: - Thirty-seven Black Cleveland police officers (many in uniform, including Joe) are taking the
Some roll their eyes at the questions
Some try to copy answers
Others, like Joe, work with rapid concentration
But he gets stuck on #4
Marks it false
Erases it
Marks it true
Erases that
Ponders
Goes on to: #5
At times  hear so well it bothers me
(/) He marks that true
- , 36, an ambitious government lawyer with a relaxed, vaguely hip manner, looks over the file of the ingratiating   sitting across the desk from him
Officer Leland
You know the difference between a black man and nigger
Leland is startled, insulted, but doesn't want to blow the interview
He smiles weakly, shakes his head no
(continuing; pleasant smile) Yeah, most niggers don't
Stung, Leland tries to laugh
Carver puts his file aside, picks up another
(continuing) Nice to meet you
- is powerfully built, politically conscious, takes no shit
Carver's leafing through his file
So, Winston, what's the difference between a black man and a nigger
Winston is out of his chair before the question is finished, drags Carver by the shirt front halfway across the desk and hisses into his face: Who the fuck do you think you're talking to
Carver smiles cheerfully past Winston's cocked fist
Thanks for coming in
Nonplussed by this cool dismissal, Winston stalks out
Carver picks up the next file, unfazed
- Joe Stevens watches Carver reading his file and waiting for an answer
When none is forthcoming, Carver glances up, finds Stevens looking right back at him
The nigger's the one who falls for your bullshit
He says it pleasantly, without belligerence
Carver smiles: he's found his man
He offers his hand
Gerald Carver, United States District Attorney
Call me Gerry
- / : a grainy black-and-white tape, date and time stamped at the bottom
grungy street, palm trees
The light from the monitor dimly illuminates Carver and Stevens
On  the  finds:   in jeans, sneakers and sweatshirt on a street corner
He ought to be wearing a sign
You can tell he's a cop
Stevens laughs: it's obvious
real   joins the cop
: "You got it
" : "In the motel, right over here
" The Cop's uneasy, keeps glancing back toward the  as they go
He keeps looking for his back-up
Now, the other guy knows it, too
Then why's he taking him to the room
(why else
) To rip him off
Carver studies Stevens in the darkness, impressed
: The figures disappear into the motel
We hear their voices
: "Here, try some of it
" : "Uhh
No,  don't
" : "Why not, you sonofabitch
" Two bursts of
plainclothes cop, , (black, stocky, powerful) bolts from behind the , sprints toward the motel
The wobbles after him
(continuing) Too late
: The  (jerky, hand-held) nears the open motel door
Taft is bent over the Undercover Cop's body
Oh, Bobby
Jesus, Jesus
(to the ) Get an ambulance -- and back up
Now
He slams the wall, starts past the
Carver pushes the pause button; the tape freezes on a jerky image of Taft's face
(focussed on Taft) Who is he
Charles Taft
Narcotics
He's a good cop
He's a great cop
Two [names citation] and a [another citation]
As tough as they come and twice as honest
Carver watches Stevens watch Taft, smiles at something
But the cops aren't getting it done here, are they
Gotta try something new
He opens a manila envelope, dumps the contents on the desk: driver's license, social security card, high school transcript, prison records
all in the name of William
Hull
No photos
(continuing) Who's John Hull
You are
If you want to be
(off Stevens) Most undercover guys don't know what they're doing because it's a day gig
(indicates dead cop on ) need somebody who goes under and stays there; six months, a year, five years
What does he have to do
Buy drugs
Sell drugs
Feed me information
He's a snitch
He's a drug dealer
criminal scumbag
But for the right side
(beat) want you to come to Los Angeles on loan to the Justice Department as a federal agent
Your experience there will be credited toward your seniority here
And you'll come back to Cleveland a P3 or higher
(uncomfortable) can't do that
've got a wife and kids
You're separated from your wife, she's filled for divorce
You see your kids every other weekend
Stevens takes a breath: this is awkward to explain
(almost a confession) All my life 've stayed away from that stuff
've never touched drugs
(tolerant) Come on, a little grass
Not grass
Not nothing
never even had a drink
(his motto) Never have, never will
You don't understand
made a choice in my life
What's to understand
You saw your father killed when you were ten, and you decided you wouldn't be like that
(off Stevens' surprise, Carver grins) 'm God,  know everything
You wanted to be a good boy, so you became a cop
Hiding out in uniform
That's why you got the hard-on for Taft
It's not that simple
(opening Joe's file; as if reluctantly) 'll tell the truth, Joe
You're never going to be a Taft
don't believe that
But he does
(looks at  results) You ever take a look at your psychological profile
You score almost like a criminal
(reading) "Resents authority
" do not
"
Exaggerated moral standards, but with no underlying value system
" Look at the anger, the repressed violence, it's almost off the scale
Let me see that
Carver hands him the scores which are, of course, just clusters of numbers
Stevens is upset, though oddly unsurprised, as if this only confirmed his secret fears
Why'd you join the force
(awkward, but felt) wanted to be of use
Well, now you can be
You won't be Taft, but maybe you'll be something more
interesting
(sits back) There's a man named Ramon Gallegos who supplies 60% of the cocaine to the West Coast
He's smart, smooth, and sufficiently elusive that we don't even have an adult photograph of him
However, his uncle is Hector Guzman, an important Latin American political figure
Gallegos uses Uncle's connections to get product into the country, and everyone we've sent after him has ended up like that
Indicates dead body on
Why would  be different
You already are, that's the point
(indicates file, test scores) You've got the ability and the personality to go underground and blend in completely
That's what the others couldn't
Some part of them showed
That's why they're dead
See, there's only one rule in this game
Stevens raises his eyebrows: what
(continuing) Don't blow your cover
- Stevens parks outside a small, well-maintained house
As he gets out, he spots a    (black and Hispanic) playing down the street
He's not pleased about that
(calls to them) Joe-, Carmen
, 7, and a , 5, (both light-skinned) run to him shouting, "Daddy," jump into his arms, competing for attention, as if they haven't seen him in ages
What were you doing with those kids
- & Playing
(displeased) Your mom lets you play with them
- & Yes, sir
Yes, sir
His strictness has already sobered their enthusiasm
Sensing this, he attempts to embrace them which he can do only awkwardly
Meanwhile, his wife,  (Southern white) has come out the screen door
She and Stevens bristle at each other
thought we talked about this
The older brother up there's got a sheet with -- Lay off it
They're just kids
Both are ready to fight, but restrain themselves
big Polynesian,  comes out the door
Hey, Joe
Tito
moment of surprise, then he gets it
He looks to Terry
She gives a little shrug, refusing to be embarrassed
- Stevens is trying to seem interested in Carmen's little drawings
They're real nice, honey
Is that a horse
(exasperated) Daddy
It's a bunny
She puts her arms around him
(continuing) don't want you to go away, Daddy
It's my work
've got to
Over her shoulder he sees Terry sitting with a subdued Joe- Her face seems to say, "See,  told you
" Avoiding this accusation, Stevens notices a bruise on Carmen's arm
(continuing) What happened to you there, baby
Tito did it
(instantly outraged) He hit you
(up in a fury) God damn it, what's he doing touching her
'm gonna
Terry intercepts him on his way out of the room
She was running behind his chair when he got up
It was an accident
(he's uncertain) complete
total
accident
Stevens looks at Carmen who giggles
He's humiliated by his own temper, attempts to calm himself
Terry puts a sympathetic hand on his shoulder
: -   - The immense sprawl, the arterial flow of the freeways, the blinding light
We
-  - People getting off, among them the former Joe Stevens, now known as
He's carrying a suitcase
/
- Hull goes up the stairs onto a downtown street
- South
neighborhood
13-year-old   selling drugs through a car window
Hull walks by
He's at ease, looking around, his manner subtly announcing that he belongs here, just as in the train station he seemed to belong among the commuters
-  - fat   (61, large white glasses, tiny shoes) leads Hull down a corridor
Television mostly
was on "Sky King" twice, "Ramar of the Jungle
" That was a silly show
The jungle was mostly flats
They pass an open door where a 6-year-old boy, , a latchkey, sits on the stoop playing Gameboy; inside, his mother, , a broken down whore, is doing her nails and drinking Pepsi
She looks up, bats her lashes at Hull
(continuing) You want my advice, 'd stay away from that bitch
She opens the door to the room across the hall
dump
Hull walks in, drops his duffle: he'll take it
The Blonde lounges in the doorway
He closes the door
- Hull empties his pockets on the dresser
Looks at his money, room key, identification
Looks at himself in the mirror
He touches his clothes, his face, tries on different expressions
(: Throughout the film, Hull continually checks himself out in mirrors, both to adjust his appearance to the circumstances and as if in an attempt to recall who he "really" is
) 79TH   - On the seam between South-Central and
Lots of people out: children, students, dealers, whores
Hull with a new haircut
,   - Dealers (most in mid-teens) meeting cars, making transactions
All this casually observed
comes up the street, reciting his version of an old street toast
On the day of the King's castration, all the counts and no accounts were down on the deck with Georgia Tech taking turns in the back seat
Those dealers not at car windows, gather around
He never speaks to them, goes on declaiming as he exchanges drugs for money
Hull watches, talking to another street person
His appearance continues to change: clothes, posture, walk, gestures subtly conform to the environment, a bit like Zelig
Throughout the film his appearance shifts, depending on who he's with
We always recognize him, but each time he's different
He walks up to a dealer, makes a quick buy and keeps going
But he sees them and is seen
- Hull drops eleven foil balls on a green blotter
Carver counts out money for him
'   - He sits at the window, eating a burrito, watching little James play in the courtyard
- Hull approaches another Dealer, the 13-year-old seen earlier (angelic face)
Like Hull, he's trying to act tough
Whatta you got
13-- (voice just changing) Nickel rock, dime rock
Excellent shit
Hull exchanges a folded twenty for two foil balls
He walks off
He has gone twenty feet when
to a stop opposite the Dealer
huge young black man,  (23, all in red with a red headband), leans out the passenger window, shouting at the 13-year-old
What the fuck  tell you about being here
Everyone turns to look, but Hull's view is blocked
13--  (
) No, wait
(
) Too fuckin' late
noises
Ivy is waving an automatic weapon
Everyone on the street but Hull has hit the ground
(enjoying it, shouting) Get down, motherfuckers
Ivy laughs and fondles a girlfriend as the car  off
He sees Hull, pretends to fire, laughs as Hull, too, ducks
When Ivy's gone, he runs to where a  has gathered around
13-- lying in the street, a bullet hole in his head, eyes open
He twitches and kicks, blood pulsing from the neat wound
Then he's dead
The faces around him (young, old, many races) watch with a variety of emotions
Who is he
Why'd they shoot him
Ivy did him, man
He's in the wrong fuckin' place
That poor boy
Get his beeper
Cops push through to the body
As the crowd disperses, Hull can't take his eyes off the boy
When he finally does, he sees Eddie, drink in hand
Their eyes meet, and Eddie, a rapper, raises his eyebrows in brief acknowledgment of sorrow
(sadly) He done done, ain't he
- : bar with a neon bird for a sign
Hull enters
- racial mix
Hull takes a seat at the bar
Stuffed birds line the lintel above the bottles
female  (long red nails) greets him familiarly
How's it going, John
'm in there
Without being asked, she sets him up a Dry Sack with a long red straw
(: He never touches the drink
) Hull's appearance has continued to change
His clothes have become flashier, he has an earring, the start of a goatee
Eddie approaches the bar compulsively reciting one of his toasts
(to himself) "Where's the Queen," said the King
"She's in bed with laryngitis
" "Is that bastard still in town
Fuck the Queen," said the King, and ten thousand knights straaaained at their utmost
(to the bartender) Pina colada times two and a white wine
He goes on muttering under his breath, tapping his foot like any crankhead
He notices Hull, greets him as someone he can't place but knows he's seen around
(continuing) How you doin', Dudley
Tries to remember name
John
John, man, right
Clasp hands
Eddie takes his drinks, carries them to
where he rejoins a white man,   (30s, slick, powerful) and a well-dressed   (mid-20s, good- looking)
She gets the wine
Elias rises to let her out
As the woman passes Hull on her way to the restrooms, their eyes meet: an instant of perfect chemistry
He's struck
Her features open, grow sensual for a moment, but then, as if seeing something she doesn't like, her eyes flick away, and she walks by as if he weren't there
'  - (: Hull invariably meets Carver in this anonymous room, distinguished only by the green blotter and a view of the city
This simple regularity suggest visits to a psychiatrist, Carver probing, testing, teasing, trying to draw Hull out
And they feel like therapy, at once a respite and a torment
) More foil balls on the blotter beside boxes of 3x5 photographs
Photos of Eddie and David Elias are up on a corkboard, the beginning of a pyramid
Eddie something
a motormouth
he supplies the street dealers
buys from him
(reads name on back of photo) David Elias
who apparently buys from a guy named Barbolla or something
But  haven't seen him
Carver produces a photo of a handsome Latin in his 50s, pins it on the board above Elias
Barbosa, Felix
There was also a woman, but she's not here
(as Carver reaches in a drawer) saw a kid killed
Twelve, thirteen at the most
Turf war
Carver shrugs: these things happen
He hands Hull a lot of cash, much more than expected
Hull does understand
Get to Elias
Then to Barbosa
You can't rush this stuff
Rush it, please
want art, John, not reality
Budget hearings start in April, and  need Gallegos by then
They won't give us funding for three ounce buys
We're not just doing this for the funding, are we
Without funding, we aren't doing it at all
: - Virtual darkness save splinters of light between the curtains
Pipes burn here and there in the gloom
Ten or fifteen crackheads huddle around a battery-operated  on which Tom Brokaw is narrating an  documentary on drugs
12-year- old sits against a wall too stoned even for television
Hull approaches Eddie, regally installed on an automobile bench seat-cum-sofa, a lit pipe in one hand
We barely notice the redhead kneeling between his legs, face buried in his crotch
He greets Hull from wrecked bliss
They know each other now
My man, Dudley, he's so fud-ley
Hull greets Eddie, some of the others, drops familiarly onto an adjacent auto seat
The patrons are making fun of Brokaw, laughing, exchanging fives
Eddie, man,  need
Eddie holds up a hand telling Hull to wait
His mind is elsewhere
His features contract in brief concentration
Whatever happened to that Drug Czar motherfucker
He gave up 'cause he finally realized he didn't know nothing about any of that shit
More laughter, etc
Eddie's concentration peaks, breaks off into a sigh and a smile
Eddie sings a satisfied little song
The redhead rises from Eddie's crotch, and we see it's a boy, seventeen going on death; he might have been pretty a year ago
Eddie passes him the crack pipe, lets him suck greedily for a few seconds before ripping it out of his scabrous mouth and offering it to Hull, who, with a grimace that gets laughs, declines
The others continue to watch and comment on the speech
So what is it you need so bad, blood
Need, need, need
whole , quick as you can get it
(impressed, a trace of envy) Comin' in the world, Dudley
(winning grin) All because of my man
Eddie likes that, holds out a hand
Hull hits it
Give me a day
Hull nods, rises
(continuing) Stick around, let the bitch Hoover you, too
Indicating redhead
In all these scenes, Hull acts indifferent to the horror, but here the effort costs him
He masters his disgust with a joke
Only if you Clorox him first
Everyone laughs, even the boy
- Eddie comes out the back door of a building, is immediately collared by Taft (the cop on the videotape)
He's in his mid- 40s, stocky, balding
(cheerful, gregarious) Eddie Shitface
Where you been, boy
Eddie breaks free, runs three feet before  (a muscular Mexican) knees him in the groin
Eddie crumples
(continuing) Eddie,  don't think  introduced you to my new partner, Michael Hernandez
Pleased to meet you, Mr
Shitface
- Eddie folded over his wounded nuts
Hernandez and Taft sit on crates to either side
The drugs they've taken from him are neatly arranged on a garbage can lid
You have the right to remain silent
You have the right to an attorney
You have the right to go back to Ontario for eight-to-ten on a second offense
(in several kinds of pain) Oh, man,  can't go back in there, just can't
(soothing) 'Course you can't, child, 'course you can't
That's why you're gonna start giving us some help
'  - pleasant, Santa Monica neighborhood
Spanish style house
'  - Pleasant, tasteful
Elias's wife, , (dressed like the attorney she is) sits in an alcove-study reading a real estate contract through half-glasses
Elias himself is helping his daughter, , 7, with her homework
He is 38, with the body and bearing of a powerful man
Again
Three times four
Seven
Elias is not a sweet Daddy
It should make us uncomfortable to watch him push his daughter
No
You're adding again, you have to multiply
Three and four is seven
Three times four is
Twelve
Three times five

Can you get that
Eight
(getting up; more about the answer than the door) Damn it
Why can't  just use a calculator

- Three men:   (whose photo we saw in Carver's office)
Barbosa is a veteran of the coke business, but he's doing too much of the drug now; he's sweating, paranoid, unstable
With him is , early 60s, a wizened high-voiced old con who Barbosa keeps the way Spanish kings kept dwarfs, for amusement and luck; like the court jester, Gopher can say anything he wants without fear
Behind them is an Hispanic kid, , 17, a thug
Elias knows them all, but is not happy to see them at his door
What are you doing here
We've got a problem, David
Call me on the phone
Your friend Eddie just started bending over for the cops
This is very bad news
Elias murmurs a shaken, "Shit
" and steps outside, half-closing the door behind him
(continuing) They busted him, and he's dealing to save his ass
Which is how he'll lose the skinny little thing
Did he give us up
Not yet, but he will if he has to, and eventually he'll have to
(
) Daddy
thought we were doing my homework
don't think he'd talk about us
He'd try not to
If we whack him, he definitely won't
(
) Daddy
(to Miranda) Just a second
(to Barbosa) Not yet
Let me check on this, first
(taunting) Nobody said you had to do the dirty work, David
'll take care of -- Felix, if he's a problem, we'll kill him
'll kill him myself
He doesn't realize until it's too late that Nancy has just then opened the front door to see where he went
They look at each other, a terrible moment: she knows what he does, hates it, can't bring herself to leave him, hates herself for that
(continuing) Nancy, get out of here
For you; it's Eddie
She hands him a cordless phone, goes inside closing the door
You got a tasty wife, David
No wonder you don't want us coming here
(warning him) Don't talk about her that way
Barbosa laughs
He can't help it, David, it's his nature
(into phone, chipper) Eddie
Sure, man, what do you need
- Elias joins Eddie and Hull to one side
In the b
g
two guys sparring
David, this is John, John, David
Eddie, this is Eddie
Everybody ready
(to Elias) So what's this, you want to meet me
(charming, touch of mockery) like to know the important customers
Hull makes a show of weary patience, gestures: here  am
(continuing) You're taking a lot of weight for a guy we hardly know
Where're you moving this stuff, John
We haven't seen you around
We like to have a sense who your customers are
Ah, come on, man, do Macy's tell the Gimbel motherfuckers
(beat; watches him) Eddie, forget this guy, he's a cop
He gets up, walks away
He's blown it
He's been made
The crushing failure
He rallies himself to indignation
What is this shit, Eddie
thought you were the man
Eddie's sickened, wants to get paid, owes Taft a bust
Nobody's the fuckin' man
Go to your place
'll call you
/
- Taft and Hernandez, watching the gym
Hull comes out, looks up and down the street carefully
Taft sits up, pays attention
This is our collar
Hernandez grunts
(continuing) Who is he
Some scumbag
But Taft clearly thinks there's something different about Hull
He's not sure what, but it troubles him
(: Hull makes a little move that Taft will later realize was a cop's move
For now he can't quite place it
) - Eddie pleading his case to Elias
He's no cop, David
He's an animal
You see his eyes
You never see a cop with those eyes
know this shit, man, you don't
(giving him an opening) What's going on, Eddie
Twenty-six thousand cash is what
We need it, David
We're behind
Elias studies Eddie: is he a rat
Elias hopes not, but he's going to find out
He hands a fat Federal Express envelope through the window
(a warning) want him to get it all, Eddie
Eddie bows in gratitude, hurries off

'  - Hull's unlocking his door when Belinda, the hooker across the hall, comes out to talk
Her 6-year-old, James, watches, silent
(a crackhead) Mr
Hull
Mr
Hull
(wearily) What's happening, Belinda
Now you know, Mr
Hull,  was to the welfare this afternoon, but the bus, you know what 'm saying
the one bus, and then the other, and when got there they'd gone and changed the time on me, without notification
They's supposed to give notification, ain't they
They said  got a thing in the mail, but  don't remember, don't think they sent it, so now 'm off the welfare, plus  forgot to take James for his shot
for the school
Which otherwise they let him go
And he's gotta learn, he's gotta learn, don't he, Mr
Hull, you tell him, so's he can better hisself
Hull slouches in the doorway, fingers to his eyes
(to James) You had any food today, James
(disclaiming any need) had Ding-Dongs
(sighs, gives him money) You go to the Mexican place over there, and get the chicken tostada or the beef and bean burrito or both
And a milk
don't like milk
want a -- (an order) You get the milk
And get something for your mother, too
(to Belinda) What do you want
Now, Mr
Hull, if you just -- (to James) Two tostadas, two burritos, two milks
Gives him another bill
The boy runs off
You now,  look out for my James best  can, Mr
Hull, but it's hard
Now you like the boy, don't you
Hull grunts
(continuing) know you do
And  was thinkin' if you wanted to take care of him, that might be good for him
Give him a male figure to look up to
Look, Belinda,  can't
If you could just give me something for him
Say five thousand dollars
(off Hull's shock) Or maybe four thousand
couldn't give up my boy for less than four thousand
Hull is rescued from this horror by the ringing
He runs down the hall, grabs it
It's me
'm here
Where
five minutes
He dashes past Belinda into his room
Or you could just give me a part now
He closes the door, takes the money Carver gave him out from behind the mirror, dashes back outside
As he rushes by: (continuing) Let me do somethin' for you, Mr
Hull
Let me do a little somethin' for you
He keeps going
The Blonde Woman addresses Belinda
No solicitin' in the halls
told you that before
(spunkier than we've seen) ain't doin' shit
Bitch
-     - handful of customers under a mud sky
The  of a distant helicopter
Hull pulls into the lot beside Eddie's
He climbs into the , tosses Eddie a brown envelope; money spills onto his lap
Eddie does a quick count, produces the Fed Ex envelope
The usual white stuff
Hull's about to taste when the chopper swoops in with a sudden blinding overhead light
booms down like the voice of God
This is the police
Remain inside the vehicle
Place your open hands against the windshield so that they are clearly visible
Christ
(a strategy) Spread the floor, Dudley
(rap sound effects with rhythmic head spasms) -ga, a-ga, a-ga, a-ga
Eddie starts the car, and Hull rolls out the passenger door as the  races across the lot
Two black-and-whites and an unmarked converge on the stand
Hull can't reach his car
He vaults a metal rail and runs off between two buildings
Hernandez jumps out of an unmarked and races after him
Taft speeds the car out onto the street
running
Police and  pursuing
He hurls the Fed Ex envelope into a dumpster
light sweeps over him
As he cuts around a building, Taft opens a car door right into his face
Hull goes down hard
(into car radio) Thank you kindly
He waves at the helicopter which goes away, kneels over Hull who is twitching spastically on the ground, gasping for air
Hernandez arrives carrying the Fed Ex envelope
(continuing) How you doin', child
Hull is astonished to look up and see Taft looming over him, the man he remembers from the videotape
He tries to speak: (barely audible) You
(briefly puzzled) Me
Of course, it's me
You know me
Hull shakes head, winces
(continuing) Hurts, huh
Hull tries to curse
(continuing) Here,  want to show you something
You have kids
He takes out his wallet, opens it to pictures of his two children, a boy and a girl, seven and eight
(continuing) These are mine
Aren't they the most beautiful children you ever saw
Hull groans, twists in pain
Taft sticks the pictures in his face
Hull is affected by the children despite everything
(continuing) Yeah,  know, they kind of leave you speechless
So let me ask, if someone put a gun to your baby's head, wouldn't you kill him if you could
Hull just looks up
(continuing) Me, too
And you're the bastard with the gun
He takes the Fed Ex envelope from him
(hoarse; his first words) You know the difference between a nigger and a black man
Don't jive me, boy
The nigger's the one covers Whitey's ass by puttin' the brothers in jail
Taft yanks him hard to his feet; Hull cries out in pain
You ain't my brother
- Hull is led in with other handcuffed
Carver is here, catches Hull's eye
Hull shakes his head; doesn't want Carver to intercede
woman   (26, attractive, harried) addresses the prisoners
Hi, 'm Shelley Weissbrod
This is only an arraignment, a preliminary hearing, but if you don't have money for an attorney, the Public Defender's office can
Hull is listening to this when a  taps his shoulder
You've got counsel
Over there
Puzzled, Hull sees the back of a suit conferring with a The suit turns
It's   who smiles, offers his hand
Hull is stunned
Elias enjoys that
You're a lawyer
'm your lawyer
Who hired you
(smiles) It's pro bono
If you don't want me, there's Shelley
She's good
She just can't provide special services
Like what
(
) (calling the next case) John Hull
Getting your case called first
Elias addressing the court
(continuing) Your Honor,  believe the preliminary police toxicology report will show that the substance seized from my client was Mannitol, a baby laxative
We move for immediate dismissal
Hull is surprised at this news
The Judge looks to the Prosecutor who waives objection
Gavel
(continuing; to Hull) We're out of here, Dude
As they walk toward the back, Taft approaches Hull
There's already a deep pull between these two, and in Taft's presence, Hull can't sustain the tough street act
We almost see the little boy inside him
(to Hull, amused) Baby laxative, they sold you some bad shit
(to Hull) You have a constipated baby, and you're in jail
What kind of a father are you
father who don't know his own children, ain't that right
long look between them, broken when Elias takes Hull's arm, leads him away
Elias cheerfully greets a couple of hookers waiting arraignment
Hull furtively grabs his sleeve
(under his breath) You sold me Mannitol, motherfucker
(under his) If it hadn't been, asshole, you'd be in jail right now
Come on,  want you to meet some people
- After hours
The place is closed
couple of cars in the lot
Elias's  pulls in
- Deserted except for one table where Eddie, Barbosa, Gopher and Chino are eating shrimp
They look up as Hull and Elias approach
Eddie's astonished to see Hull
Dudley, Dudley, Fo-Fudley
Surprised to see him, Eddie
Eddie looks around, uneasy
(continuing) John got busted and kept his mouth shut
Can't say that for everybody, can we
What are you saying
Are you saying me
Are you saying something about me
Tell the truth, Eddie
Be honorable
It's all you got left
Shut up, you little faggot
The cops made you give them somebody
We know it
Eddie looks around
Everybody's looking at him
He considers lying, but realizes it's pointless
All right, so what
mean, so what, man
You got the money
Twenty-six Twenty-six, David
Count it
Next time you might trade us
Never
(turns to Barbosa) Never, Felix, never
Come on, man, you know 'd never
Hull observes Barbosa become the power center
(softly) know you never will
Felix, no
Don't be
'm worth money to you
Let me give you money
Why
You don't owe me anything
Another twenty-six grand
Just to show you
Fifty
Why not a hundred
(that's so much) hundred
Felix
Barbosa's impassive
(continuing) Okay, a hundred
Give it
Tomorrow
Twenty-four hours
Now
Ten seconds
Felix,  need time
-- One
two
don't have it right now
But  can -- (sadly) Then goodbye, Eddie
forgive you for what you said to me
(pleading) Twelve hours
Tomorrow morning
Six
seven
(to Elias) You want to do it, David
Elias looks stricken
Barbosa laughs
Eddie jumps up
Hull turns away, can't bear to watch this
(continuing) Nine
grabs the first thing he lays eyes on, a tiny snail fork and plunges it into Barbosa's neck
As if it were a fly bite, Barbosa flings the table aside and, with a long knife already in his hand, guts Eddie from groin to breast bone
Eddie falls like a suddenly emptied sack
Elias can't help gasping
Hull looks away, hiding his horror
Barbosa rips the fork out of his neck and hurls it at the body
Piece of shit
Elias stares at Eddie's body, transfixed
Horrified, fascinated, afraid, in awe
Barbosa turns to Hull
(continuing) What'd you think
At least it was clean
(pleased, to Elias) What about you, bar mitzvah body
First time you saw somebody die
(eyes fixed on the body) No
(catching breath) At camp
when  was fourteen
a friend of mine was water skiing
The motorboat ran him over
junior counsellor was driving
You should kill a man some day, David, it's liberating
(walking out) Summer camp
'm in business with somebody who went to summer camp
Everyone else is silent, grave
'  -  - Through sliders we see a small pool
Elias and Hull sit over uneaten omelets
Both still shaken by the previous scene
Eddie, man
He was always nice to my daughter
How'd a guy like you get into this
The way most drug lawyers do: clients paid me in product, and  had to move it
Soon  was doing more dealing than law
But this was '83, '84, there was so much money we thought it would never end
Yeah
And now
The road gets rougher
Cocaine's a dying business
Then what are we doing here
People are always going to want to get high
Every society has ways to alter consciousness
Because they can't bear reality
(smiles) We all need our delusions, only the means change: psychedelics, opiates, prayer, orgies, human sacrifice
What's next
Elias puts a finger to his lips
(continuing) Why aren't you selling it
know how to make it and market it
But  need capital
That's the only reason 'm hanging out with an asshole like Barbosa
(feels his hatred of Barbosa) And because  can't get to the big guys
Who are the big guys
Gallegos, et cetera
(reacts to the name) Why can't you get to them
What do you care
Hull shrugs: he doesn't
(continuing) Anyway, designer drugs have a bad name: ice, ecstasy, tar -- there's a limited market for Parkinson's disease
But what about completely safe, almost legal, terrific shit you can go to work on and do your job better than you ever did it straight
Sounds like a dream
They hear someone coming
(closing the subject) In dreams begin responsibilities
Tell me about this new shit
Some other time, John, when we know each other better
(as Miranda enters kitchen) Hey, bunnela
(she snuggles against him; Elias enjoys it) Five times two
It's too early
Don't bother me
He hugs her, kisses her, much more openly affectionate than Hull was with his own children
Hull notices that
(continuing; head in her father's chest) Seven
Elias whispers in her ear
(continuing) Oh, yeah
Ten
Who's he
That's my friend, John
This is Miranda
Hi, Miranda
Miranda gives Hull a shy greeting
Nancy hurries into the kitchen, handsome, busy, ready for work
Come on, honey
Nancy, this is John
Nancy nods briefly in Hull's direction
Elias kisses Miranda who grabs the back-pack her mother proffers, and they go out
When they're gone: (continuing; on Nancy's chilliness) That's not about you
It's, she's
judgmental about what  do
When they're gone, he opens louvered doors onto a washer/dryer, takes a sports bag off a shelf, gives it to Hull
Hull looks inside
White powder
He tastes
Real
He hefts the bag
That's more than  bought
Half we owe you
The other half's on consignment
token of our esteem
You're having trouble moving it
Elias doesn't deny it
(continuing) Make me your partner
'll help you get your capital
don't need a partner
need a salesman
'  - Now in daylight
Two separately wrapped kilograms of crack cocaine on the green blotter
can't buy this much shit
haven't got it in the budget
What am  supposed to do with it
You're a drug dealer, John
Deal drugs
Hull just looks at him
Carver doesn't blink
You know how this goes, Gerry
It won't stop here
You know what they're going to ask me to do pretty soon, to prove 'm down
What am  supposed to do then
Don't blow your Carver
Hull: a moment of horror as he realizes what Carver is saying
-- '  - He's filling glass vials with crack
Hundreds of them
It's tedious work
He spills some, curses
He stops
He can't believe he's doing this
He goes on doing it
(
) You're still thinking like a cop, John
Forget that
Cross the line
Be what you are
You're a criminal
You don't give a shit about other people
You're just trying to survive
- Hull doling out vials to  seen earlier with Eddie
(
) can't do this shit
just can't
- going up to cars as before, only now they're Hull's dealers
well-dressed Black businessman buys from his
(
) But you want to be of use
You want to get drugs off the street, don't you
(
) That's why 'm here
- Another sale: Teenagers on foot
(
) Well, this is the cost
Pay it or go grow flowers someplace
'  - He comes out of the motel talking to a Dealer we've seen above
You can't back down with them
You've got to project strength, from inside, you know
The Dealer nods
Across the street Hull sees: blue sedan
Taft and Hernandez
Taft gives Hull a little nod and grin
- Hull sitting in an aging Trans Am, making entries in a notebook
Across the street he watches: (19), a squawling baby in arms, buying from one of his Dealers
He kicks the dash in frustrated anger
Under the : Cocksucker
As soon as the woman's gone
He goes over to the Dealer, slaps his head, slaps it again
Under the : (hurt, confused) What'd you do that for
(walking off) 'Cause  can, motherfucker, 'cause can
- white housewife making a buy from a new mini-van, a baby in the car seat
- Two  football players (letter jackets, huge) hassling , a woman dealer, pushing her, she pushes back, curses
Suddenly Hull comes running up, shoves them apart
He's yelling, pointing a finger in their faces
Elias comes up behind, calmer
Hull is smaller than either  kid, but they back down as he curses them
Under : Touch her again, motherfuckers, 'm gonna mess you up
brief scuffle
Hull decks one , and Elias pulls him off
The kids leave
Elias doubles over with laughter
Hull yells at Bijoux and walks off
- Hull (looking at written address) knocks on a door
It's opened by a beautiful, dark-skinned black woman in a skimpy robe
She looks at him with disarming frankness
He thinks he must be in the wrong place
Is David Elias here
(
) Momentito
Through the door we see him emerge from a bedroom stepping into his loafers, buttoning his shirt
He gives the woman along, dark kiss, caressing her body
Jacqueline, ho-ney
She laughs, closes the door
As he and Hull walk to the street, Elias sings happily to himself: (continuing) "Who's making love to your old lady
while you're out make love
" (cheerful) How come  like balling black chicks so much
'Cause you're a racist asshole
You feel like you're fucking a slave, and it gets you off
Oh, don't mau mau me with the Malcolm shit
Tell me you're not chasin' white pussy every chance you get
don't dig white women
(knowing that's a lie) Even if  did, it wouldn't mean the same thing
Sure, it'd be the slave fucking the master
Hegel talks about it
Just like me, but the other way around
Fuck Hegel
Who the fuck is Hegel
Some smart-ass kike that talks backwards
Elias laughs, gets into Hull's car
Hull's angry, takes a beat before he gets in
Everybody digs the other, John
They dig their own, and they dig the other
Does your wife dig black guys, David
Did she fuck Eddie
Does she want to fuck me
(mock-terrified) Ooo
you mean with that great big purple dick of yours
hope not
She'd never be impressed with my little thing again
You think what impresses her now is your dick
(musing) What does impress her
Hull can't help laughing
He starts the car
'  - Elias and Hull approach
Hull's carrying a satchel and wearing a new leather jacket
- As they go in, Elias switches the  sign to  and turns the latch
The store is filled with Latin American folk art, particularly masks which line the walls
, the woman Hull saw with Elias at the bar, comes out from the back
She is 27, a bad girl trying to dress the way she thinks a banker who went to Vassar dresses for success
She's also a little strung out
She and Hull recognize each other at once, (a brief reprise of that moment of perfect chemistry) but she avoids his gaze
Betty, this is John, my new associate
Your new Eddie
hear the old one wore out
Factory recall
John's going to be a good customer
He does a lot of wash
Hull puts the satchel on a display case
Betty still won't look at him, opens the satchel, begins a quick count
She does this with a speed and sureness that suggests high test scores
So how's this place work
Betty doesn't answer, so Elias covers the awkwardness
Betty wires the money to a store in Aruba in payment for things they never sent her
They deposit the money in a bank there that turns around and loans her money she never has to repay
That way it doesn't turn up as income for the
Welcome to the laundromat
David, you talk too much
She doesn't trust you
Hull has taken down a mask, puts it over his face, looks in a mirror
How much is this
More than you can afford
'll take it
She produces a vial of coke, looks questioningly at Elias
By all means
She draws out six lines
Elias does two
(offering him the straw) Come on, Eddie 2
you're up
No, thanks
: Betty is acutely attuned to Hull, and in his refusal she senses -- albeit unconsciously -- two things: first, that he doesn't trust himself on drugs, therefore, he's a dangerous guy and, therefore, exciting; and, second, more important, the refusal bespeaks a repudiation of the violence and danger and, thus, a longing for goodness
Despite the seeming contradiction, she finds this even more attractive
But because she feels herself to be bad, his goodness seems only a judgment against her, and so she thinks she hates him
Who is he, my mother
(smiles) Never have, never will
Betty ignores him, does her lines
(taunting Hull) Oooh
Cocaine,  love it and hate it and  love it
The disease is the cure
She can't help looking at Hull who's looking at her
She and Elias are stoned; he's not
(continuing) Don't look at me
Elias, tell him not to look at me
don't like the fucker
But Elias is too busy vacuuming up Hull's leftovers
(sniffling) John's an ascetic Negro; he wants to make sure you know he's not a jungle bunny
Watch your mouth, David
But he's got another side
You should seen him on the street the other day with these two  kids
Do the spade bit for her, John
(black accent) 'm gonna mess you up, muthafugga
He sticks his finger in Hull's face just like Hull with the boys
Don't call me a spade
And don't tell me to play black
He says it gently, but Betty hears the edge
(hurt, disappointed) Come on, John, you do it so well
(falling into it) Ah ain't playin', muthafucka
Ah ain't playin'
Hull glares; Elias refuses to be intimidated
(continuing) Don't fuckin' dis me, muthafucka
Fucka
fucka
fucka a
fucka b
fuck b-hive
fucka, fucka, fucka
Elias dances around repeating "fucka" until it's almost musical
Hull picks him up and slams into a wall
Say it again, and 'll kill you
Elias throws Hull back against a display case
He's strong and unafraid
They're ready to fight
Grow up, assholes
This half snaps them out of it
Still glowering, they slowly relax, release each other
- Hull sits in the Trans Am eating a sandwich and watching the street as a  leans in the window telling his sob story
There's an authority to Hull's manner that tells us he may not like this job, but he knows how to do it
The guy ripped me off, man, so don't got the money,  don't got the stuff and -- (eyes on street) You gotta pay anyway
Oh, but, man
As he raps on, comical pathos, Hull spots in his side mirror
coming slowly this way
Ivy in the passenger window, the barrel of an automatic weapon glinting in the streetlight
Shit
Hull glances up: Bijoux is selling on the next corner
The Range Rover passes the Trans Am
Ivy leans out
Hull flings open the Trans Am door, throwing the Dealer to the ground
He jumps from the car: (continuing) Bijoux
She turns
Sees Ivy
She puts out her hands to block the shots
The  of the gun is inaudible
The barrel bounces slightly
Bijoux sprawls backward
Bijoux: dead on the sidewalk, limbs askew, bleeding from many wounds
Hull, standing over her, covers her face
- The body has been taken away, the crowd has cleared
Elias sits on the hood of the Trans Am
Hull stands, staring down
It wasn't your fault
(no response) What could you have done
She worked for me
'm supposed to protect her
Elias knows that's true, and it leads to another truth
We have to kill him
Hull looks up
(continuing) Or we lose all authority with the other dealers
And one of them'll kill you
Hull looks up, startled
(continuing) You've got to assert now, or you're dead
Hull sees the truth of that and slowly nods
(continuing) And if we kill Ivy, we control this whole territory
That guy who works for Barbosa can do it, Chino
No
If we use Chino, it's Barbosa who's asserting
It'll be Barbosa's territory
(again: his hatred of Barbosa) It's gotta be us
Right
And if it's us, it's gotta be you
Meaning he can't do it
Hull knows that
long beat on Hull's face as he reaches the inevitable decision
(to himself) Don't blow your cover
What
If  do this, we're partners
Equal partners on everything
Elias offers his hand
Hull stands up, a sudden resolve
(continuing) Let's go
(afraid) Now
But Hull is already moving
/
'  - Hull and Elias driving, looking for Ivy
Elias double parks by two prostitutes
We  in the car with Hull who's silent, frightened, keeps trying to warm his hands
Outside, Elias is talking and laughing with the prostitutes
We see them point
He gives them money, kisses
They laugh
He gets back in the car
- The Range Rover parked in front
Elias's car stops pounds from inside
Then one  : They pass the club, other store fronts
Turn at the corner
Turn into an alley
Down the alley past the same buildings
The rear door of the club
To the next street
Turn
Turn
onto the original street, back to the front of the club
They stop again
Go wait around back
Elias nods
beat
They look at each other
want to see you in that alley
Hull's so terrified he seems calm
With an air of submitting himself to fate, he gets out and walks into the club
- Crowded and  and strobe lit
Hull pays the cover and climbs a staircase to a
that overlooks the dance floor
On stage: a   with its throbbing beat and below Hull a sea of dancers
Hull circles the balcony
It isn't hard to pick out Ivy -- he's all in red, dancing with the woman we saw him with in the Range Rover the first time
Hull reaches the steps again and starts down, keeping his eye on Ivy
The number ends
In the pause before the next one, Ivy can be seen excusing himself, heading toward the rear of the club
The next number begins
People dance
Hull pushes his way through the dancers to
-    - leading toward the rear door they saw from the alley
woman's room
men's room
Hull goes into
'  - Ivy is pissing into a urinal
He's so huge he seems to take up all the space in the tiny room
Hull stares at him, unable to look away
He notices Hull
All dialogue is  the
What're you looking at
Hull stares at Ivy's face
Ivy considers this rude
(continuing) You want to suck it, bitch
(offers his dick) Or drink it
Laughing, he turns, urinates on Hull's pants
Hull doesn't move
(continuing; recognizing him) Oh,  know you
You're the bitch whose whore  wasted tonight, ain't you
Somebody pushes on the outside of the door
Hull holds it closed with his back
(continuing) gotta take care of you, too, huh
He reaches into his pants for the butt of a gun
Hull is frozen
Ivy starts to draw it out
Hull steps forward, grabs Ivy's gun arm
With his other hand he clumsily pulls a silenced
22 from inside his jacket, puts it in the underside of Ivy's jaw and  twice
Ivy's brains spray upward onto the wall, and he slides straight to the floor
Hull steps out into
- An Hispanic busboy coming out of the kitchen sees him and the gun in his hand, freezes
Hull walks past him and out the back door
From inside we see Hull go down three steps, stumble in the drive and fall to his knees, the gun  away from him
couple that had been making out, stops, looks
It takes Hull a moment to gather himself
He picks up the gun, gets into Elias's car
It drives away
'   - Alone, he looks at his face in the mirror
As if he doesn't know the person there
With a knife, he draws out something hidden inside the wooden backing of the mirror
manila envelope
He empties it onto the dresser: Mementos among which we see, carefully preserved, the blood- soaked bills his father gave him
Hull ignores them and picks up
He smooths out the folds, stares at it as if trying to fix this in his thoughts
-   - Hull on the phone
He's unusually excited, even moved
Carmen, it's me
It's Daddy
'  -  - Carmen on the phone, jumping up and down with excitement
Daddy
(
) (through phone) Hi, baby
How are you
miss you
What
(
) miss you
(thrilled) miss you, too, Daddy
- Hull pressing the phone to his face, trying to master his emotions
16MM  - lab rat with a metal electrode protruding from its head, is running a maze at high speed
explaining things
(young, nasal, too smart) The maze leads in two directions
At one end the rat can obtain a food pellet
At the other
(pointer indicates each end) it receives electrical stimulus to a very specific area of the cerebellum
The rat reaches this second destination, pushes a bar, is stimulated
lab worker (white coat, gloves) picks up the animal, replaces it at the start
It runs the same route
(continuing) This rat, like 86% of the others in the experiment, chose the electrical stimulus repeatedly and exclusively
It continued to do so until it died of malnutrition
-- the rat dead
- 21-year-old  from the Cal Tech chemistry department (red hair, freckles, glasses held together with electrical tape), a brilliant nerd
He picks up
Colored balls stuck together with wooden dowels
This is an addictive amphetamine with time-space distortion, delusions of grandeur -- or maybe they're real -- tending to be impulsive, sometimes violent behavior
Psychotropic adaptation for late monopoly capitalism
It's illegal, and you can buy it on any street corner
He tears off some of the balls, sticks on new ones
(continuing) This increases energy, attention, cognitive powers, yet with a smooth, almost opiate-like emotional surface
Ideal for the post-political, post- rationalist global marketplace and 24 hour lifestyles
It's completely legal and can only get it here, in my lab
(to Hull, proudly) Randy's a genius
His professor told him he could win the Nobel prize
Nobel prizes are for wussies
What does this shit do to you
'm on it now
It's like cocaine only better
(offers him powder on a slide) Want some
don't take drugs
(unoffended) Your mistake
This is designed for the top end of the market
For people who want to master reality, not avoid it
Because it's synthetic, you don't grow it, refine it, or -- best of all -- import it
What would it take to manufacture this stuff in quantity
With a million dollars,  could produce enough for a limited market at about two bucks a pop
(makes a face: fair) But then with five million, or better yet ten, the cost would drop to thirty cents, and we'd have enough for the whole world
'm going to put two hundred fifty thousand into your corporate account
You cheat me, Randy, 'll use your bladder for a bagpipe
(to Hull, with a vengeance) We're going to put Barbosa out of business
Elias is very happy
He leads Hull out
'  - On the pyramid chart there's a black border around Ivy's photo, as around Eddie's
photo of Hull is now on the board beside the one of Elias
Hull stares out the window, lost in thought
(dismissive) Synthetic shit
Sounds like a 20/20 segment
Hull shrugs: it's not that important
Carver turns to his real interest
(continuing) So, what was it like
(still looking out) What was what like
Popping Ivy
You knew
'm God, remember
(looks back out) Then you should know how it was
Carver smiles, but he's non-plussed by Hull's new detachment
You didn't clear it with me
You're getting independent
That's good
Hull smiles
(continuing) How're we coming on Gallegos
He supplies Barbosa
To get to him we'll have to take quantity
Then you've got to -- That's what killing Ivy did
'll get to him soon
Carver's impressed
(continuing) Is that it
(seeing him to the door) want you to get a new apartment
Something expensive
like where  am
That shithole
You're big time now
Act it
And get some clothes
Spend money
Have fun
That's an order
'  -  - Hull in a new, expensive suit, gives the big Blonde Woman cash
Whether 'm here or not, no one else uses that room
And change the linen twice a week, just like now
(starts to go, stops, more money) And make sure James gets what he needs
And something for you
He adds another bill
She smiles
- Views, open space, expensive furnishings
Hull (in another fancy suit) is hanging a couple of Betty's masks
He's meticulous about their placement
Elias wanders out from the other rooms, looking around
(impressed, envious) Nice place
Nice suit
Hull has a moment of self-consciousness about the suit, checks himself out in a mirror -- a private moment
Elias flops on a couch, puts his feet on an antique coffee table
Hey
He hurries over, lifts Elias feet to the floor
Hull brushes the wood, inspects it carefully, fusses, worries
Elias is amused
You pick all this shit out yourself
Jewish lady in the store helped me
(mock touched by racial harmony) Aw
Very nice
Understated
'm impressed
Hull starts to place stacks of cash in a briefcase
He's momentarily mesmerized by all the money
(to himself) Fifty bucks, fifty fucking bucks
You sold it all
Hull nods
(continuing) 'll order a couple more keys from Barbosa
Order ten
Ten
Better twenty
(afraid of that) don't want to push it
do
We've got a bigger territory, we need more product
want to deal directly with Gallegos
It would save us money
Barbosa'll never let us near him
Hull closes the briefcase, ushers Elias toward the door
He's going out, too
If we buy twenty, Gallegos'll come to us himself
How do you know
When  bought a key from Eddie, you came to me
Elias laughs, surprised, afraid
(continuing) Who's above Gallegos
Guzman, but he's
Don't ask so many questions
How else will  learn
(hint of a threat) Call Barbosa, David, put in our order
Because we have to split this, and there isn't enough here for both of us
Elias feels the threat
'   - Despite the  sign, a light's on inside
Hull knocks
No response
He keeps knocking without let-up until: ' (annoyed) Nobody's home, go away
He knocks harder
Finally she appears in the doorway, stopping short when she sees it's him
She's immediately aware of white streaks on her grey suit
she tries to brush them off
(doesn't want to let him in) Look, 'm tired, why don't you
Hull holds up the briefcase
She sighs, unlocks the door
'  - bill counter toting up the cash
She watches it fixedly to avoid looking at him, but she feels the chemistry
Why do you look at me like that
How do  look at you
Like you know something  don't
Like you're better than me
That catches Hull off-guard, and he responds with a candor she didn't expect
don't think 'm better than you don't think 'm better than anybody
She's startled by this remark and instinctively drawn to him
(continuing) But  do know something
You can't stop thinking about me
Embarrassed, she looks away
He takes her hand, and at his touch something yields to her
She lets him draw her to him
His kiss is strangely tender, searching
It turns Betty on incredibly
She melts into him
Let's go back here
She leads him into
She's sweet and loving, but her sweetness scares her
He's all over her, but she pulls back for a moment
There is a couch and before it a coffee table with coke scattered on a plate
(indicates coke) Do this
do it with me
She offers him a straw
He doesn't take it
(continuing) This is where 'm at
You want to be with me, it's gotta be there
don't do that
Never have, never will
It's for fuck-ups
What do you think, you're not a nigger
You're a nigger as much as me
More
She's angry, hurt, confused, wants to love him, but feels he won't let her, or she won't let herself
It's torment
Finally she's released by a  on the door
She goes out to
Lets in Elias
He smells the tension
(amused, jealous) Having fun
(neither answers; to Hull) talked to Barbosa
He'll see us now
Hull turns to Betty
Both want to go that way instead of this, but events are leading somewhere else
He follows Elias out
- pouring into the darkness
- Kids dancing to a live
High in a wall: a lit window
- Very different from the club
comfortable room with a bar, tables, filled with men much older than the dancers below
Barbosa and Gopher at the bar with Elias and Hull
Chino and other   lurk in the room's depths
Ten kilos
You're always late on two
Not ten
twenty
Barbosa's impressed
(continuing) The more we have, the more we can move
There're markets we can't open because we don't have the inventory
Barbosa's coked to the eyeballs, mean and dangerous
Finally some balls on this team
(taunting Elias) Come work for me, John
'll give you your own franchise
You can supply Elias, lean on him when he's late
Go fuck yourself
Barbosa laughs
'm with David
Why
He give you his "designer drugs" pitch
He's never going to do it
He's a shmuck
Don't talk to me that way
'm not talking to you at all
'm talking to John
It's the cocaine
Don't listen to him
Felix, you've had enough
Shmuck
Elias goes for him
He's fast and strong, and it takes Chino and Hull to pull him off
Praise God they don't let guns in here
"None of that in here
" "Take it outside
" Barbosa's laughing, but his cheek is flecked with his own blood, and his eyes are dead
David, you've been working out, you're getting strong
Are you quick, too
(shadow boxes) Come on, 'll give you a shot at me
Any time, any place
Right here, right now
Do this
He puts his hands out, palms up
This
What is this
You know, you slap me,  slap you
(mimes that game) Come on, it's fun
Like summer camp
It doesn't look fun
Elias glances at Hull for guidance
Don't waste your time
Stay out of this
(to Elias) Come on, you can do it, David, you're not a shmuck
Elias puts his hands out, palms up
Barbosa covers them with his own
: Barbosa's broad, muscular with thick gold rings and a Rolex; Elias's paler, slighter, a wedding band and a slim watch
(continuing) Slap my hands
Just slap them
Elias looks Barbosa in the eye
He's trying to be a snake, but he's more the mouse
He looks away and as he does tries to
Slap him with both hands but hits only
Air
The room breathes
Barbosa turns his rings so the big surfaces point down
(continuing) Now it's my turn
It's Barbosa's turn
He's gonna kill the white boy
One more
No, you went, Davey, now it's my turn
First to four wins, like the World Series
Elias covers Barbosa's palms with his own
Oh, God,  can't look
: Barbosa tenses his hands
Elias yanks back
Barbosa's hands haven't moved
You remember the rules
If you flinch, get to hit you
He slaps Elias across the face
Hull starts forward
knife appears
He stops
(continuing) Again, shmuck
Elias covers Barbosa's hands
Barbosa tenses
Elias holds firm, and Barbosa quickly slaps both hands, hard
Elias doubles over, holding his hands in pain
One
That was two
No, this is two
He slaps him again, a stinging crack
Elias looks to Hull, but they're across a canyon
Hull lowers his eyes
Oh, and it hurts
Mercy, it hurts
Barbosa moves his hands a millimeter, and Elias flinches again
Barbosa smacks him across the face
The sound reverberates through the room
Now even Gopher is silent
Tears run from Elias's eyes, blood from his mouth, but he doesn't move
(continuing) Three
Felix
No mas
Finito
steps forward out of the shadows
He is young, mid-30's, handsome, European features, beautifully dressed, accompanied by a guard we'll know as
Someone murmurs to someone else: Gallegos
Hull reacts
Their eyes meet
The fight is over
The Ambassador from the South has spoken
(refusing any mercy) One more
Barbosa shakes his head, ashamed now in front of Gallegos
(continuing) One more
We're not finished
(people are silent) Four was the match
He holds out his hands
Barbosa resumes the stance, then waits, waits, waits, and finally brings both hands down, terribly hard, the sound of the slap is awful
Four
Okay, that's it
Get away
Hull leads Elias to the door right past Gallegos
Their gazes meet again
As they go out they hear Gallegos  Barbosa in furious Spanish
- Trembling, Elias holds his bloody hands against his chest, as Hull leads him in silence down the steps
Look at me
Look at me, damn it
He barely whispers, but it's like a shout
Hull, who'd been avoiding his gaze, forces himself to look
Elias's humiliation is so profound it almost ennobles him
Finally: Why did you do it
needed it
They taught me what needed to know
That 'm not part of them, and  never will be
That they don't respect me
That  don't deserve respect
Because 'm a shmuck, John
'm a shmuck
He laughs a terrible laugh
The door behind them opens, and Barbosa appears with Gopher
Everyone is ready for death, but: David, 'm sorry
It's a crazy time, and
you know
'm doing a little too much coca
'll buy your kid a pony
anything you want
Let's forget about it
He comes down the stairs, offers his hand
Elias will never forget about it, but he silently takes the hand, holds them in his own bloody paws, looking directly into Barbosa's face
Barbosa becomes uneasy, manages to extract his hand
Elias and Hull continue down and out the door
Gopher gushes to Barbosa
am so proud of you
You can be cruel, and you can be kind
And just now you were kind
Proud, proud, and more proud
That's me
Shut up
- Barbosa, Gopher with Hernandez, Taft's partner
Now we know Hernandez is corrupt: that's how they knew Eddie was talking
got nothing to give you, my man
'm an il-liquid son of a bitch
Felix,  keep telling them, " have informants down there, 'm working guys,  can't say who
" If you don't have money, give me busts, or they're gonna start wondering about me
They're already wondering
(deadpan) You can have Gopher
Oh Gawd
How about a lawyer
(knows who he means) Felix, don't do this
(he knows, too) Great, lawyers are great, Jewish is best
But  need spades, too
The politicians want dark facts to scare the suburbs so they'll vote Republican
Lawyers and spades;  got the trifecta: two dealers and a girl who does their wash
Two niggers and a kike; all Democrats
You're my man
And afterwards
Hernandez rubs thumb against fingers
When this is over, 'll send you to Hawaii, Maui
It's very beautiful in Maui, it's a very spiritual place
just want money
And he's gone
wouldn't trust that man when he's out of rifle range
Barbosa looks tired
(continuing; premonition of disaster) Don't do this, Felix
It'll go wrong
Kill Elias if you have to, honey, but don't set him up for this
It damages your prestige
Barbosa faces his cocaine
He tries to resist the pull, then yields
He does another line
It's his friend
He loves it
He picks up a cellular phone, dials
David, you're awake, 'm impressed
'm sorry about what happened
Listen, 'll get you twenty boxes, like you wanted
You were right, you should have what you need
Tomorrow night
Bring your partner and that girl with the store, Betty
need her advice on something
want us to have fun, like we used to
We'll go to that shrimp place, okay
Good
Me, too, David
(hangs up; does another line; drawing it deep into him) Yes
'  - Hull jacked up, excited, pleased with himself
As he paces, Carver observes his beautiful suit, shoes, expensive watch
He looks much better than Carver
We're getting twenty kilograms tomorrow
(notes the lightening sky) Tonight
made it happen
pushed Elias, now he doesn't make a move without me
You run Elias
control him
Barbosa's selling it to us because he thinks  can move it
(now the big news) And last night  met Ramon Gallegos
Carver sits up fast
Hull likes that
(continuing) We're getting the dope from him; it's still coming through Barbosa, but Gallegos will approach me soon on his own
We're going to get him, Gerry
We're going to bring him and the whole thing down
Carver sits back, grimaces
(continuing) What's your problem
(looking out window) My problem
My problem is that you don't really know what's happening
(sardonic) Oh, so, tell me what's happening, Gerry
Barbosa is setting you up tonight
Bullshit
He's dealing you to Taft and Hernandez
You're going to be taken down as you receive the drugs
They're putting together the arrest team right now
That rocks Hull
He is up, pacing
What do we do
You stay away
We're going to take them down
Who
Elias and Betty
Don't be silly
My boss wants a bust right now
He goes before the oversight committee next week
He needs something to justify the budget
(imploring) 'll get him something
Give me ten days, and 'll get him Gallegos on a plate
Too late
The whole thing's set up
Gerry, what are you telling me need Elias
and Betty
You arrest them, and you're throwing away everything 've set up
It's out of my hands
Hull walks out
(continuing) John, don't go near that bust
96TH    /
- Elias (no sleep) driving
Betty in front
Hull in back
We shouldn't go to them
Maybe them come to us
He wouldn't
They pull into the lot of a boarded up restaurant where Barbosa and Chino stand outside of a limousine
- Taft and Hernandez in the same van that was outside the gym earlier
They're watching  , night scopes
They spot Elias's car
(whispering into radio) Here they are
Nobody move until we see the green suitcase
- The two groups meeting
Barbosa gives Betty a courtly kiss
(flirtatious) 'm sorry for dragging you out so late, but  have to be careful
It gives me confidence
watching planes descend into the airport, nervous
He knows what's coming, but how does he handle it
Let's see what we've got
Elias takes a satchel out of the rent-a-car trunk
Chino opens the limousine's trunk
Inside is an over-sized day-glo green plastic suitcase
He is about to pick it up
(continuing; spotting the police van in the adjacent lot) Don't touch it
Everyone looks at him, then the direction he's looking
What is this
Something's wrong
What's that van doing there
Everyone looks
They can barely see the van
Hull pulls a gun
(continuing) This is a bust
The minute we take the stuff, they'll be over us
He's crazy, David
thought you were the crazy one, but it's him
Hull puts the gun to Barbosa's head, addresses Chino: Chino, pick up the suitcase and give it to Elias
'll only kill him if something goes wrong
Chino moves to pick up the suitcase
No
Everyone looks at Hull amazed, even Chino
(softly) Fucking , John
Okay, everybody in the car
He throws the money in the limo truck, slams the lid
He's running the show now, and everyone knows it
He's winging it, but confident and strangely calm
Elias, energized by Hull's command, grabs Barbosa and throws him toward the limo
' We have a problem
Shit
Shit
Shit
(aiming rifle; Hull in sights) Enough of this
No
- Hull shepherding everyone into the limo
He glances toward the van
On instinct
He pulls Chino to him
Chino's head explodes
Betty screams
(screaming at van) Don't shoot
Don't shoot
- Taft hurling Hernandez against the wall
Goddam it, what the hell are you doing
- Elias drags Barbosa into the limo
Hull throws Betty into the front seat
The limo takes off
/
-  - Hull driving, Betty up front
Elias with a gun on Barbosa in back
Hull slaloms the limo through police
Windows are blown out
Glass everywhere
(weeping) asked for this
asked for it
It's my fault
(calm, eyes on road) Relax
We'll make it
She looks at him, stunned yet soothed by his certainty
He's a cop
He has to be
How else would he have known
If  was cop, you'd be face down back there
How did you know
The whole thing smelled
Changing his mind about the stuff
Meeting us way out here
And 'd seen cops in that van before
Hernandez is dirty, that's who he's using
(to Barbosa) Get out of the car
He starts to open the door
David, not now
Yes, now
'  - Racing
Taft at wheel, raging at Hernandez
Who are you, man
Who the fuck are you
(stonewalling) 'm me
-  - He traded us to the cops
Just like Eddie
Eddie, who was nice to my daughter, had to die because that's the rule
And you were vulgar about my wife, Felix, so at the very least the same rule applies to you
'll give you money
'll give you a million
Anything you want
want you to get out of the car
Get out of the fucking car
Out of the fucking -- (near tears) No, no
we can't do this
(turning around from front seat) Stop it, David, or we're
Elias wheels on him, sticks the gun in his face: (in a fury) Look at my hands
He holds them up: swollen, black and blue, cut up
(continuing; to Barbosa, softly) Get out of the car
Barbosa's frozen
Elias grabs his hand,  a bullet through
Barbosa screams
No
Goddammit
Elias wheels on them, swinging the gun from one to the other
Stay out of this, or you'll die
You'll both die
Everyone'll die
His fury makes anything seem possible
He pushes open the door
Trembling, Barbosa starts to climb out
The limo enters a tunnel, police still in pursuit
Halfway out, Barbosa stops
can't
Elias  him in the butt
He shrieks, jerks forward
The cops are getting close behind
Other cops waiting at the far end of the tunnel
Hull hits the brakes, spins a 180 into the opposite lane
Barbosa is flung out of the car and plastered by a succession of fishtailing vehicles
Hull speeds back the other way
They're going straight at: -     - Taft and Hull, the two drivers, lock eyes
It's chicken, but more than that
Two men set against each other who, for some reason, want to be friends
At the last instant, the van swerves away, but: Taft sees the gun too late
He can do nothing
Hull's gaze follows Taft's
He sees Elias, deliberately swerves, sending the  wild
-  - had him
You want to kill a cop
Don't be stupid
The limo speeds away
/
-  - The windows shot out
Hull and Betty silent, shaken
Elias charged up, happy
Everything is different
We're the Colombians now
(radiant) This is the greatest night of my life
Terrible but great
Felix was right
(appalled) About what
He said  should kill a man
He was right
My God
Barbosa was a roach
Do you miss him
Will anybody in the world miss him
Are you a roach, too
(happily) Yes
Thank God
(to Hull) What about you
He's silent, keeps driving
She's had enough
(continuing) Stop the car
Hull looks at her
(continuing) Stop it
He brakes to a stop
She jumps out, leans back in
(continuing) No more laundering, no more anything
'm finished with this
And she disappears into the night
Elias watches her go
Hull resumes driving
She knows too much
We have to kill her
No
She's with me
She's not going to talk
(looks at Elias) You touch her, 'll kill you
She's your responsibility then
Hull accepts it
(continuing) We're going to get the money now, John
Enough for the new drug
We're going to be rich
We're going to be so rich that we're going to leave the world of ordinary people and going to a higher realm
mean that
They're going to come after us
(matter-of-fact) It's a hardball game
We're hardball players
-
- Hernandez comes out of a bodega with groceries, wine and a woman
He nuzzles her as he lets her into his car
As he's getting behind the wheel, Molto (Gallegos' guard) stops the door from closing
The conversation is entirely in
It wasn't my fault
It never is
He  him in the head
Hernandez slumps against the wheel
The woman screams
Molto walks away
/
'  - Hull finds a door, pushes the buzzer
Betty looks through the glass
She's afraid of him
Don't kill me
'm not going to talk
swear
Please
Then she looks closer and sees not murder in his face, but need
She opens the door
Without a word, he gathers her to him
She can't resist him now
Her mouth is everywhere on him
- Betty gasping in the wake of pleasure, turning her face away from him, she feels so exposed
Don't look
She hides her face in his neck
- They lie in each other's arms, relaxed together for the first time
wonderful, unprotected openness
(softly) Tell me about you
(half-kidding) Everything worth knowing you just found you
He laughs
They begin to make love again
Suddenly: stroking Betty's hair
She gasps
gun in Hull's ear
Another in her face
Guns all around
Don't hurt her
Hands pull him out of bed, leave her there alone
We see Molto, two or three others
- lays a bouquet of white lillies on a grave
He kneels, whispers a prayer, crosses himself
He rises and walks to where Molto and the other guards hold Hull and Elias
Gallegos is in his thirties, more European than Barbosa
He has a distinctly mild manner
Who's grave
An impudent question, but Elias seems strangely bright-eyed despite the guns held on him
My wife's
She died of leukemia three years ago
(looks around) like to be among the dead
They never interrupt you
(turning to them) Felix Barbosa started out as a skinny fourteen-year-old fucking Yankee businessman in Bogata hotels
He grew up
He made himself strong and rich, but getting there made him sick, and that killed him
So he lost everything for the same reason he'd gotten it in the first place
Now we'll see if you can do as well
going by greets Gallegos who responds warmly
They chat a minute in
The Priest leaves
(continuing) Felix owed me one million eight hundred thousand dollars
He addresses this to Hull; Elias feels left out
(continuing) When you killed him, you bought the debt; now you owe it to me; you get to keep thirty percent, like he did
You have three days
Gallegos turns to leave
Who did Barbosa collect from
If you don't know, you shouldn't have killed him
He notices Hull's earring: two tiny dice, the spots made of minuscule jewels
Unembarrassed, he fingers it
(continuing) Cute
Can  have that
Without waiting for an answer, he yanks it out of Hull's ear and walks away, leaving Hull bleeding through his fingers before a stone cross
- club on the corner
we see a   on the stage, their  pumping out onto the street
Hull pulls up in a Jaguar
He and Elias go through a door adjacent to the club
/
'  - The  is still audible here, though muffled
Elias and Hull are pushing at door Gopher is trying to hold closed
don't want you in here
You killed the man, and  loved him
don't want to have anything to do with you
Elias kicks it open, and they enter Gopher's tiny, miserable domain
He's wearing some sort of negligee and an immense naked woman fills his bed
We still hear the
(continuing; apoplectic) 'm a sixty-three-year-old man
'm a grandfather
Would you hit a sixty- three-year-old white man
Would you hit your own grandfather
(slaps him against wall) Listen, you fucking monkey, you know who owed him money, and we know you know
Tell us or -- Hull pulls him off
Elias is angry
They struggle
He'll tell us
Gopher, just
Meaning: deal with me or deal with Elias
You can't tell anyone it was me
The  continues  the following sequence: - Elias arguing with a dealer
He slaps him around
Money is exchanged
The money is stuffed in a satchel
- well-dressed lawyer (30's) talking with clients, a distinguished couple in their 60's
The door  open and a secretary is unable to restrain Hull and Elias as they charge into the room
The lawyer is up on his feet, but Hull shoves him around as Elias politely explains to the clients that this will only take a moment
Hull's hands thrust more money in
It's getting full
- biker in leathers on hands-and-knees spitting blood onto the cement floor
Hull stands over him, fists clenched
satchel stuffed with money is latched, set next to another latched one
third is opened, money and jewelry dumped in
- Hull looking into the trunk
Elias is beat
Where the hell is all the money
We're still a million short
gotta get laid
David, we've got thirty-six hours
(slams trunk, moves toward door) Pick me up at Jacqueline's in the morning
Sooner than that
Elias gets in the car and drives off
Hull turns and a dark American sedan pulls up alongside
Carver behind the wheel
(an order) Get in
- (as he gets in) What are you doing here
You're going to get me killed
Carver peels away fast
He's very angry, frightened, too, but that's hidden
Where the hell have you been
Doing my job
There's an indifference to Carver's authority we haven't heard before
Hull isn't even aware of it, but Carver is
You violated a direct order to stay away from that bust
As a result, a police informant is dead, a state senator was critically injured in the tunnel pile up and a city policeman was subsequently murdered
didn't blow my cover
Don't get smart with me, motherfucker
Don't be a shmuck, Gerry
'm talking to Gallegos
'm collecting his money
We can set him up right now
(: Carver arrives somewhere and parks
To be discussed, but let's say, for now, that we are:) -   - They get out of the car
Carver takes out a flask, has a drink, offers it to Hull who declines
Never have, never will
(puts the flask away) want you to give me your gun
You're coming in right now
(doesn't understand) Coming in where
Your assignment has been terminated
You're not going out there again
If have to, 'll put you in custody
(uncomprehending) 'm going to have Gallegos in two days
Carver says nothing
Suddenly Hull understands
(continuing) You're protecting him
You're protecting Gallegos
Carver snorts: ridiculous
(continuing) No, of course
That's why you wanted to bust Elias and Betty
was getting close, and you wanted to cut this off then
What is he, the new Noriega
Helps you fight commies, so you let him sell drugs to the niggers
Two birds with one stone
You violated orders, so you're through
Don't make a conspiracy theory out of it
(laughs) 'm through
Then,  might as well have a drink after all
Surprised, Carver reaches for the flask
As he does, Hull grabs him, pushes him out over the edge of the building, holds him there
(continuing) Now tell me the truth or they're going to decide your troubles got the best of you
Carver struggles
Hull pushes him out farther
Carver dangles
You're insane
All the more reason to do what say
Jesus, Ger, 'm having trouble holding on
All right
Say it
It's the State Department
Hull pulls him back in
Carver slumps against the wall, drinks greedily
Hull lets him for a moment, then takes the flask away
(continuing) told you, Gallegos's uncle is a big deal down there
Guzman
Guzman, right
Our government supports Guzman because he's a moderate
That's a right-winger who's pro-
(he doesn't like it either) If Gallegos got busted here, it would hurt Guzman's political career there
It's politics, John, not drugs
Drugs is politics
Politics is drugs
(sickened) Christ, Gerry,  dealt drugs
killed a man
Others died
What did  do all this for
For nothing
'm going to Washington, John
'll bring you with me
We'll have clout, money
(outraged) didn't do this for clout or money
You said we were gonna do some good
We tried
Trying's for college boys
(his head on fire) If all there is is power and money
If all there is
then what am doing here
'Cause  can get more power and money out on the street, got more there already, than 'd ever get kissing your ass in Washington
But you can't do that, John
It's not you
Me
There is no me
We took care of that
First  was a cop pretending to be a dealer
Now 'm just a dealer pretending to be a cop
Why not stop pretending
Quit the force
Be a dealer
It's not that simple
My assignment's already terminated
All  have to do is quit
hereby quit
(lifts the flask) My first one
(drinks) Not so bad
He slips the flask in his pocket, gets in the car, starts engine
Don't blow your cover
Hull drives off, leaving Carver alone on the roof
'  - She lets him in, sees the distress in his face
What's the matter
He shakes his head, drops onto the couch
He takes out the flask, offers it to her
She shakes her head
Who are you, my mother
He laughs, takes a drink
She's surprised, says nothing
Tell me
Tell you what
What you came to say
What did  come to say
Then tell me anything
Something about you
Something real
(long beat; another drink) When  was young,  occasionally stole things
(laughs to himself) My father died when  was ten
Right in front of me
The revelation is so sudden it surprises Hull as much as Betty
(continuing) Heart attack
He just fell down
He said, " love you," then died in my arms
Oh, baby
She holds him, and he lets himself be held
(continuing) Tell me what's going on, John
(doesn't want to talk about that) You're not doing the stuff anymore, are you
Pulls playfully at her nose
No
Don't change the subject
How is that
It's hard
John
(trying to tell without telling) Things are getting, they're getting a little
confusing
had certain plans, and people haven't come through exactly as they promised
What do you expect with those people
(laughs) It's not just those people
It's
it's bigger than that
It's of everybody
Present company excluded
You've got to stop this, John, you know that
You gotta get out
can't
Of course, you can
(almost angry) No
This is what 'm supposed to do
Supposed to
Who said you're supposed to
The whole fuckin' world
You think didn't try something else
But everything funnels you right back here
Like it's where you had to go all along
But you know what you're doing, don't you, selling this stuff
Doing to our own
If  tried to get out now, they'd kill me
(tortured) can't be with somebody's who involved in drugs
He nods
He knows
He's even happy about it
But she won't yield
Finally he gets up and walks back out the door
'  - 4
The neighborhood is reminiscent of the one where Joe Stevens Sr
was killed
The rap club still pumps  onto the 4 streets where whores, junkies, children, teenagers with beepers and Nikes, welfare mothers roam as if it were daytime anywhere else
Their eyes, yearning, sullen, vital, hopeless and hoping stare at
Everyone knows what he is: the Black Man with the Big Car
They don't remember when he was just another hustler making street buys
Now they hate him, revere him, want to be him, not caring what it entails
Every eye follows as
He and Elias cross the street toward Gopher's door
Hull's eyes don't go right or left
He's a driven man now
'  - Gopher has just been roused from sleep
light in his face, Hull and Elias looming over him
There've got to be more
We have a million two, we owe Gallegos one eight
told you everyone
Everyone who owed him, everyone he
One eight
He's lying
Barbosa barely owed him a million
Hull and Elias look at each other
'  - Taft is showing her photocopies of phone bills, bank transactions, invoices
She's obviously upset
got every money transfer, every phone call, all your laundry tickets
(miserable) What do you want
John Hull
can't
Or you'll go away 'til you're a dried up old woman, and when you come out, ain't nobody gonna want you
She covers her face
/
- Elias driving a car we haven't seen before and snickering to himself at some private joke
What are you laughing at
Elias shakes his head: nothing
He laughs
They pull into the lot beside a movie theater
- Technicolor Spanish melodrama is winding to its lurid end
door in back opens, and a burst of daylight reveals Hull and Elias being brought in by a guard and met by Molto
Molto and the guard frisk them, take their guns and money satchels, make them wait a moment until
The movie ends
The house lights come on revealing Ramon Gallegos as the only spectator in the theater
He beckons
Molto and the guard bring Hull and Elias down the aisle to him
Gallegos looking in the satchels
tense moment
It isn't one eight
(off Gallegos) It's a million one
That's all Barbosa owed, it's all we're paying
Gallegos is stern for a moment, then laughs
Big brass balls
Collecting money makes you strong
Everybody relaxes
Gallegos scribbles something on a piece of paper, hands it to the guard who feeds it into a fax machine
What's that
'm telling our suppliers they got paid
They'll be very happy
'm happy
And we're happy
Everybody's happy
It's a happy world
Elias seems a bit mad, but no one minds
He and Hull are ready to go
He gestures to Molto, wants his gun back
So, how can  express my gratitude for a job well done
We want Barbosa's business
Gallegos gestures to Molto to give them the guns
Done
Of course
And, also, your business
All this
Your money, your dope, everything
Hull looks at Elias; what's going on
(smiles) You're tougher than  thought, but not that tough
How tough is enough
He brings up the gun and  Gallegos in the head
Hull and the guards are frozen
Then everyone goes for a gun
Elias  the guard
Hull has his gun to Molto's head and screams at Elias: No
Meaning don't shoot him
But Elias has no intention of doing so
(breathless) Thank you, John
couldn't have done that without you
(barely able to speak) Jesus Christ
He can't believe it: the guy he's been after the whole time is dead on the floor
You taught me to take my work seriously
What's going on here, David
We're taking over
You're doing too much stuff
No, 'm very clear
'm very, very clear
(to Molto) Ahora, usted nos assistamos
Enteindo
Molto nods
/
- Hull, Elias and Molto getting into their car
Molto is recalcitrant
Elias pistol whips him
Hull stops him
/
- The car passes through a development of suburban homes
They enter a driveway
Two boys play in the yard
(to Molto) Donde esta
Molto is silent
Elias  a bullet right between his feet
Molto jumps
The boys turn
Hull grabs the gun away
We feel the toll Elias's madness is taking on him
What the fuck's the matter with you
It works, John
It works
And, indeed, Molto is pointing to a Winnebago parked at the rear of the property
- Winnebago
With a tire iron, Hull snaps off the padlock that holds the rear door closed
He opens the door
Money gushes out
He slams it closed
Jesus
He, Elias and Molto are on hands and knees scooping it up
- Molto tied to a tree
Elias is giving him instructions while, strangely, removing Molto's shoes and socks
(to Molto) Disce a Senor Guzman que
(his Spanish isn't good enough) that we have his money, and we're willing to talk as soon as he comes to town
We'll know how to reach him
Okay
Molto just glares at him
Elias smiles, takes the shoes and socks and all the contents of Molto's into the Winnebago, and he and Hull drive away, leaving the car behind
/
/
- The Winnebago enters the garage, Elias greeting the attendant, "Hey, Frank
" Frank waves him in
The garage is filled with various RVs
Hull pulls the Winnebago into an empty spot beside Elias's car and gets out
Elias remains in the cabin making calculations
Approximating the cubic capacity and depending on the denominations of the bills, it's somewhere between fifty million and two hundred million dollars
Right back there
As he does, Hull checks his gun, walks around behind the vehicle and prepares to shoot Elias in the back of the head through the open window
Elias finishes his money report, and sits there as if unaware of Hull, but: (continuing; not turning around) Think 'm crazy
Yes
(blowing up, gun still on him) can't believe you got us into this
All of fucking Latin America is going to be after our asses, including Renaldo Guzman who's friends with fucking George Bush
know they're coming after us want them to
We'll give them the money, but we'll make a deal for ourselves
We'll get what we need for the synthetic drugs
've thought it all out
've been thinking it out for years
Hull uncocks the gun, rubs it against his burning face
Elias turns around, embraces him
(continuing) We're going to have everything
Don't you want everything, John
They're going to get your family, David
They'll kill your wife and daughter
(serene) Nancy and Miranda left the country two days ago
You knew about this then
Elias smiles
(continuing) What about Betty
'   - car  to a stop
Molto and three thugs smash through the glass door
They disappear into the store where things can be heard
They emerge a moment later, jump into the car
- Hull's car races up
He jumps out, dashes toward the building
- Forty  on folding chairs
Hull enters on a dead run
He stops short when he sees: at the front
He signals to her, but she's already saying: Hi, my name is Betty
Hi, Betty
My name is Betty, 'm a drug addict
And 've been clean for nineteen days
The room bursts into
She sees Hull at the back; he signals to her, but she goes on
(continuing) 've been using drugs and selling them, and 've wanted to stop for a long time, and the only way  did was because  met a man  loved and who loved me
know that's not what 'm supposed to say
'm supposed to say there was a higher power, and maybe there was, behind it all, but this man is strong and his love made me strong enough that  could start, or at least think about a life that didn't have drugs in it
She's looking right at Hull as she speaks
He's torn between the danger he knows she's in and his emotion at what she's saying
- Hull hurrying Betty toward his car
She's protesting
've got to get clothes
You can't go back
'  - Molto and men pouring through it
In frustration, Molto smashes the table Hull had fussed over when Elias put his feet up
- Hull and Betty hurry toward his room carrying shopping bags, a newly bought suitcase
They see
They freeze, turn, ready to bolt
But more cops behind them
panic, yet no one's coming after them
They walk on
The cops are going into and coming out of Belinda's room
'  - The fat Blonde Woman is talking to a policewoman
James sits on the bed staring at
who lies dead on a floor littered with crack vials
Hull picks up a vial, holds it up to the Blonde Woman with a question
(nodding) She got a fever and just burned up
She just burned up all of a sudden
It must have been bad stuff
(indicating James) He shouldn't be here
(takes his hand) Come on, James, we'll go get a burrito
The boy allows himself to be led out
Betty looks at Hull who's in a private hell
- Hull and Betty are about to enter Hull's room
The door is ajar
'  - Taft stands at the dresser
He's found Hull's collection of memorabilia and is looking at the photo of his children
Cute kids
(angry at the invasion) Give me that
He snatches away the photo, but not before Betty sees it
She reaches out her hand
He reluctantly turns it over to her
Tell me something, who the fuck are you
Hull doesn't answer, collects the rest of his things, including the bloody money, stuffs it back in the envelope
(continuing) 'Cause  don't think you're quite the asshole you're trying to be
Look, Mr
Taft, that's your name, right
Leave me alone
got things on my mind
'd think you would
You better have your goddamn life on your mind, or it's gonna get away from you
It's gonna burn up like that poor woman across the way
Like all of you's gonna burn
And what do you do, Mr
Taft, except chase bad guys up and down the street with your dirty partner, never catching anybody important
do what  can
Do you do what you can
(Hull says nothing) Maybe my partner was dirty
Maybe the chief's dirty
And the mayor
And the President
Maybe God Himself's taking something on the side
That's their problem
But 'll bust 'em if can
(without force) Get out of my room
Don't deny who you are
He leaves
Hull turns to Betty who is still holding the photo of his children
He gently takes it, looks at it, seems to draw both succor and pain from it
He gets out Carver's flask and tries to drink, but it's empty
They're my children
They live in Cleveland with their mother
'm divorced from her
haven't seen them in
some time
want to, but haven't been able to arrange it
How much else don't  know about you
(trying to make a joke) Everything else
Everything else is
don't know
Taft has all the evidence about my laundering
Hull's upset
He's going to put me in jail for a long time unless  give you up
Do it
can't
So, 've got to get away
Far away
But  need money
(laughs) Money
got money
He empties his pockets of all that gushed out of the Winnebago, empties a satchel as well until it fills the room like snow
- Hull putting Betty into an airport limousine
(to the driver) International terminal
(to Betty) 'll meet you there in a week
She kisses him
He's about to close the door
She stops it
You know the first time, when  saw you in the bar
(smiles at the memory) You wouldn't even look at me
'Cause  knew what you were thinking
You were judging me
No,  wasn't,  was
You were
Your eyes were like an angel in my heart telling me  should be good, and  didn't want to hear it
This news startles Hull, yet, strangely, he senses its truth, and the sweetness is more than he can bear
(continuing) That's you, too
Maybe this is you, don't know, but  know that's you
She closes the door
The car pulls away
In an unmarked car up the street, Taft picks up the radio
- limousine pulls into the gate and disgorges  , 55, and his wife, 25
They're shown into the consulate
The limousine pulls out onto the street and parks
Gopher appears, knocks on the driver's window
It comes down
They chat briefly in Spanish
Gopher opens up a cellular phone
-   - Overlooking the ocean
Hull pacing nervously, Elias relaxed, reading the paper
What if we forget all this
Take ten million each and disappear
Leave the country
New identities, new lives
What's the matter, John
Having doubts
Yeah
phone
Elias picks up his own cellular
Yes
Where
No
No way
We pick the time and place
Otherwise no meet
(looks to Hull who nods his agreement) Got a pencil
-  - Gopher hands a piece of paper to the limo driver
He walks away
As he's about to get into a car, Taft grabs him
Gopher is surprised and not pleased
- Where Hull and Elias left the Winnebago
Guzman's limo approaches
Frank, the attendant, waves it on
- The limo climbs the ramps until it comes to Elias's car, parked where the Winnebago was; the Winnie is nowhere in sight
The limo pulls alongside
Hull and Elias get out
Molto gets out of the limo
Then Renaldo Guzman
We have a proposal to make
We regret what happened to your nephew
Say what you have to say
We all know that your cousin's business is coming to an end
Costs have climbed while profits and the market -- Guzman waves: get to the point
(continuing) We have developed a new product: simpler, cheaper to manufacture, superior quality and completely synthetic
Therefore, no growing, no refining, no peasants, no importing, no customs agents
Here's a detailed prospectus with anticipated cash flow and so forth
He hands a copy to Guzman and the lawyer
(to Molto, teasing Elias) The racist Americans just want to cut us poor Hispanics out of the market
There are no Americans anymore, Mr
Guzman, you know that
No Hispanics, no Japanese, no blacks, no whites, no anything
There are only rich people and poor people
We're rich, so we're on the same side
- Taft with Gopher in his car
Do they have money in there
don't know
They wouldn't meet here otherwise
Gopher shrugs; a decision: Taft picks up his radio
(continuing) Okay, everybody, here's the play
- We're prepared to give you 80% of the money
The remainder you invest in our business with proceeds paid out according to the figures there
He indicates the prospectus that Guzman has been looking through
This looks interesting
'd have to confirm everything, of course
Do you have a sample of the product
Elias produces one
Guzman gestures to Molto
Molto samples it
Molto's eyes widen
Buy it
Where is our money
Elias hands him a key, points to a different Winnebago
Molto takes the key, unlocks the back: money
He signals okay to Guzman
Suddenly:
Police cars wail into the garage
The - and sweeping light of a helicopter descend toward the roof (though we never see the copter)
(continuing; anger) You set this up
They're after us, not you
Everybody scatters
The garage is a labyrinth of cement stairwells, ramps, hundreds of RVs to hide between, under and so forth
Lots of , lights, but mostly we see Hull and Elias dodging here, avoiding the action
- Molto caught between the lights
He draws his gun
He's cut down
(screaming) Where are the rest of them
- Cars with rotating dome lights, but not many cops
Hull and Elias emerge from a shadowy doorway and make their way at a casual pace beyond the perimeter of police cars, quickly mingling with other spectators
They continue down
- Strolling now
Elias elated, uncontained joy
We did it
Twenty million
Twenty fucking million
We're going to have synthetics
We're gonna be rich
We're gonna
Hull stops walking and just stands there
(continuing) What's the matter, John
Be happy
Your whole life has just been solved
(behind them) Stop
Police
In one motion, Elias draws his gun, turns and
The figure goes down
Elias can't believe he hit him
Hull starts toward the figure
(heading the other way) John, where are you going
Taft -- on the ground
Oh, Jesus, no
He drops to his knees
Blood oozes from Taft's chest
John, what the hell are you doing
Let's get out of here
Hull tries to hold closed the wound
The posture duplicates Hull with his dying father
He feels for a pulse
For breath
(distraught) He's dying
Let him die
Let him die twice
Come one
He pulls at Hull who won't go
Hull does mouth-to-mouth
Taft opens his eyes, looks up at him
[Says to Taft whatever a -trained policeman would say in this situation
] (to Elias) Get help
Are you kidding me
(to Hull, getting it) Oh, man, you're a cop
You're a cop, aren't you
(with difficulty, as if against his will) Yeah, 'm a cop
'm a fucking cop
(laughs) Oh, really
Where's you badge
don't have one
'm undercover
Get help, David
John, that's a cop
He tried to kill you
He didn't know
Oh, he didn't know
don't know
Maybe you don't know
Maybe you think you're a cop because
because
Drop the gun, put your hands against the car
Spread your legs
Police
Taft grunts once, stiffens
(continuing) My God
Please
The pulse is gone
Hull begins to perform
Okay, let's say you're a cop
Be a cop
Hull keeps doing
(continuing) We've still got the money
We put it into Randy's chemistry set
In five years we're worth five hundred million each, minimum
You'll be one of the richest black men in America
Richer than Cosby
Who gives a shit how you got it
You think the white ones were honest
Hull keeps working on Taft
(continuing) Is this asshole all that stands between you and greatness
Let me do you a favor
He puts a gun to Taft's head and
In a reflex, Hull draws his own gun,  Elias in the stomach
Stunned, he wobbles backward a few steps
Sits on the street
(continuing) Gee, John, that's kind of an extreme reaction
Hull is stunned he did it
And this finally attracts the police who see a black man with a gun who just shot a white man
Hull goes to Elias who's dead
pulls him off, beating him with a gun
Fucking nigger
- Hull, bandaged, wearing prison blues, walking with Carver
What about Guzman
He vanished, thank God, or we'd both be in deep doo-doo
At least you got Gallegos
Elias did
And everything goes on as before
That's the drug game
Plus a change
want you to come back to work for me
You'll beat all charges on a technicality and go back to who you were
Who was , Ger
Does anyone really know
have other things to do
Like travel
Tangiers, maybe
Hull looks at him; how did he know
(continuing) 'm God, remember
He beckons him
He walks him over to a cell
Through a one- way window they see: alone in the cell, unaware she's being watched
Go back to work, she walks out of here
Otherwise, she's up on multiple counts, and 'll see to it the judge runs them consecutively
Hull just looks at him
Carver shrugs apologetically
Absolutely white
Not a window, not a stick of furniture
The only deviation is Hull in prison blues
The door opens, Betty comes in wearing prison yellows
She sits on a nearly invisible chair
They know they're being watched
They want me to testify against you
said  wouldn't
You have to
It's all set up
That's how you're getting off
She shakes her head in cynical understanding
How difficult it is to get back to an honorable life
He takes her hand
(continuing; with difficulty) My father didn't have a heart attack
She looks at him
(continuing) He was shot robbing a liquor store
Trying to rob it
lied about that
Baby, why are you telling me this
had to start somewhere
There're other things you don't know
- Silent
Kissing
Beginning to make love
Hull extracts himself, gives the finger to the  and stuffs a bit of tissue in the iris, blocking our view
- Carver takes his eye from the now obscured peephole
- funeral
Taft's wife and children (from the wallet photo) leave the graveside with the rest of the funeral party
When everyone is gone, Hull approaches the grave
From his pocket, he removes the four blood-soaked bills his father gave him, and wedges these among the stems of flowers that already cover the plot
He's silent a moment, then he gets up
He joins Carver who's standing with Hull's children
The kids each take his hand, they walk together
Betty walked out of court free this morning
That's my side of the deal
(to the children) You two run on ahead
They do
Hull watches them go
Her probation gets revoked the minute you fuck up
want you to stay away from her altogether
You know the difference between a black man and a nigger
Carver smiles, shakes his head
He likes a good joke
Hull punches him so hard in the stomach that he goes to his knees
(continuing) The nigger's the one who'd even think about doing what you tell him
He walks away
Still on his knees, doubled over, Carver whispers after him: Don't blow your cover
