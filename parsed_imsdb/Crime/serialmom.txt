Interior cheery, bright  kitchen , , a trim, fortyish, pretty Betty Crocker of the 90's, grabs the toast as it pops up and butters it
She waves cheerfully out the kitchen window to the passing  on the back of a Baltimore County garbage truck and then turns to her husband and children and expertly begins to serve breakfast
, , the ultimate nice guy and a dentist by trade, divides the morning paper up between himself and son , a cute semi-hip kid who is still in high-school
Daughter, , a pretty and slightly overweight college student, frantically prices the junk she plans on selling at the flea market after classes while gulping down a light breakfast
Who wants fruit salad
do, please
(Hesitating) That's not gum in your mouth, is it
(Removing it) It's sugarless
(Gently) You know how  hate gum, Misty
All that chomping and cheesing
(Begins serving her) Sorry, Mom
Thanks
(To her brother, as she prices a record album) Hey, Chip, think  could get 50c for Vanilla Ice
wouldn't give ya a nickle
(Dreamily) Carl can't believe how much make at swap meets
(Rolling her eyes good-naturedly) And who may  ask is Carl
Just a boy
He's picking me up this morning
Here we go again
He's really cute
(Watching the cute little birds nibbling seed from the bird-feeder in kitchen window) Cute is not enough, Misty
You know that
She sure can pick 'em
(Exasperated) He goes to college with me
Leave her alone, Chip
(To ) think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly
smiles kindly, picks up a box of cereal in each hand and turns to the family
Cereal anybody
Title " " appears on the screen
Just a little, please
Bad for the teeth
Always the dentist
Chip, honey
Thanks, Mom
As  serves the cereal, she spots a lone fly as it lands on the butter dish
Without letting on to her family, she grabs a flyswatter and begins stalking the fly with a terrifying intensity, its buzzing enough to make 's head explode
(Reading paper) Look at this
(Reading out loud in disgust) "Hillside Strangler gets his college degree in prison
" (Preoccupied, stalking fly) That's nice
Nice
He should have been executed
He killed people, Mom
(To herself) We all have bad nights
(Gets ready to swat, but fly buzzes off) (To ) You'd probably date him
(Mimicking her) He's cu-uuute
Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer
" certainly did not
You've been working in that video shop too long
And all that gore better hadn't be interfering with your schoolwork
stalks fly as it lands on 's toast as the rest of the family remains oblivious to 's building anger
do great in school, Dad
(Eats toast as fly buzzes off) sickened and rage-filled  stalks the fly to 's orange juice glass where it secretes on the rim in closeup
Well, your mother's going to today
We'll see what your teacher has to say
(Takes a big gulp as fly buzzes away) (Giving a pleading look to  as the buzzing of the fly builds in intensity on the soundtrack) Aw, Mom
hate Mr
Stubbins
(Moving in for the kill, hissing the words in a rage) Don't say the word "hate", honey
"Hate" is a very serious word
swats violently and we see fly splat in bloody closeup
("Directed by John Waters" credit appears)
Family is suddenly silent as they uneasily look up in surprise at 's ferocious attack
quickly wipes up squashed fly and smiles back at her family
There
All better
