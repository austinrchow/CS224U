Written by Jon Lucas & Scott Moore September 30, 2007 --  ,  -- It's a beautiful spring morning in the Palisades
High atop the cliffs, looking out over the Pacific Ocean, sits the exclusive
Workers bustle about the lawn, setting up a high-end wedding
warms up
team of  arrange centerpieces
set the white linen tables
-- simple, classic wedding dress hangs on a closet door in this sun-drenched bridal suite
Sitting at the makeup table, surrounded by her bridesmaids, is the beautiful bride, , 20's
She's busy doing her makeup
Just then, Tracy's rich, stern , 50's, blows in
Any word from Doug
The way he spits out "Doug" tells us all we need to know about how Mr
Turner feels about his future son-in-law
No, but 'm sure he's-- Just then, Tracy's  rings
She quickly answers it
(') Hello
: -- Heat-waves rise off the Mojave
Standing at a lone, dust- covered payphone in the middle of the desert is He's in his late 20's, tall, rugged -- and currently a mess
His shirt is ripped open, his aviator sunglasses are bent, his lip is bloodied, and he clearly hasn't slept in days
Tracy, it's Vick
Parked on the dirt road behind Vick is his near-totalled 1967 Cadillac Deville convertible; it's scratched, dented, filthy - - and missing its passenger side door
Slouched inside are   , also looking like hell
2
Hey Vick
Listen, honey
The bachelor party got a little out of control and, well
we lost Doug
(her jaw dropping) What
But we're getting married in like four hours
Vick squints at the rising sun
Yeah, that's not gonna happen
: : 40 : 10  -- The top down, The Who's "Baba 'Riley" blasting from the stereo, Vick's pristine Cadillac convertible rockets down Highway 10 towards Nevada
At the wheel is Vick, looking as sharp as his Caddy in a half- open shirt and mint condition aviators
Sitting shotgun is the groom,  , late 20's, handsome, barefoot, crunchy -- an all around great guy
Behind Vick sits  , late 20's, an anal tax attorney from Connecticut, his Izod shirt tucked into his khakis
He's currently applying sun screen to his forehead
Next to Alan is  , late 20's, former high school linebacker and lovably dimwitted father of two
He drums the back of the frontseat to the music, totally pumped, like this is his first time out of the house in years
Because it is
Dude this is already the best weekend ever
Stu, relax, we're still on the 10
3
Oh, did  show you pictures of my kids
No, dude, show `em
Stu fishes pictures out of his wallet and eagerly shows them to Doug in the front seat
Doug is clearly the core of this group, the glue that holds these childhood friends together
Haylee is two, and Kaitlin is already four
Can you believe it
(smiling at photos) How cute
Good for you, man
Doug shows the photos to Vick; he nods, impressed
The one on the left is gonna be a hottie
The other one, not so much
Stu protectively snatches the photos back, muttering: Jesus, dude, those are my children-- (re: sunscreen) Hey, am  rubbed in
Stu glances over and sees un-rubbed-in sunscreen all over Alan's face
Yeah, you're good
Hey so Alan, are you and Becky still together
But before Alan can answer-- Of course they are, Doug
Jesus, Alan's been dating Becky for 14 years
When they first met, Alan had braces and soccer hair, and Becky had a functioning hymen
() 4
(') Asking Alan if he's still with Becky is like asking the sun if it still rises in the east
The guys try not to laugh; Alan scowls
She still pressuring you to get married
Enh, we've moved past the pressure stage
it's more like aggravated assault stage now
Like at the last wedding we went to, she threw a camera at my head, called me a closet fag, then ran out crying
The guys wince, oooo
(') But we talked, and everything's cool now
Maybe you could wear a helmet to Doug's wedding
Great idea, Stu
Thanks
() So Vick, how's business going
Oh, great
Yeah, 'm working on bringing the next big dessert craze to Los Angeles
It's gonna be huge
What is it
Bavarian custard
We ran the numbers, and it's gonna be bigger than fro yo
Doug and Stu nod, impressed; only Alan looks skeptical
Isn't custard like a trillion calories--
5
Our plan is to open three stores in the Valley and then franchise it
Shares are selling fast, but  can probably squeeze you guys in
Yeah, man, count me in
Me too, man
love pudding
Alan just shakes his head, unbelievable
Is this gonna do better than the hip-hop label you started, Vick
Or the topless sushi bar
Or the mobile tattoo parlor--
Tattoo-To-You was an idea ahead of it's time, Alan
And don't come crying to me when there's a Custard Cabana on every street corner in America and you didn't buy in--
() All right, all right, save it for the party
Vick and Alan quiet
Stu is still drumming the seat
Dude
can't believe  get to party all night, and then, tomorrow get to sleep in
It's almost too much
And , if anyone gets really drunk and craps themself, just let me know,  can have you cleaned up and partying again in under three minutes
No joke
am a master of stool removal
They rocket off into the desert,
: : ", 5:12 " 6
-- As the last rays of sun fade, the Cadillac crests the final hill to reveal   in all its illuminated splendor
-- The Caddy rolls down the famed Strip
We are again reminded of the absurd scale of Las Vegas
The 5,000 room hotels, the eight lane roads, the 60 foot billboards
-- The Caddy rolls up to the Mandalay Bay
The guys hop out, exhilarated
Vick throws the key to the
-- The guys enter the glittering casino four men-wide, all smiling, all exuding vibe
Passing  sneak glances
Vick slides a drink off a nearby waitress's tray as they make for perfectly pressed   waits behind the front desk
Vick strides up, smiling, sunglasses still on
Welcome to the Mandalay Bay
Checking in
Lennon comma Victor
The man types into his computer
Yes, we have you down for a one night stay in an economy suite-- Vick glances at the man's nametag; it reads "
" Hold it right there, Atashir
This is my best friend from childhood, Douglas Billings
In two days, he is to marry a woman of great beauty and strong teeth, do you understand
woman of gigantic bosoms who will give him many, many sons
Atashir looks confused
Alan looks embarrassed
7
(') My two other childhood friends have travelled great distances, across many deserts, to be here
This isn't a night in a hotel for us, Atashir: this is a family reunion
Perhaps you too have family situated great distances away, in a foreign country with much sand
Atashir looks like, sort of
Vick reaches over the counter and touches his arm, simpatico
(') Then  have but one question for you, friend: if they came to town, would you put them in an economy suite
No, sir
Well, then
think one of us needs to get back on his little computer and find us a suitable room
Atashir frowns
but types away at his computer
All the deluxe rooms are taken
The Dean Martin suite is available, but 'd have to ask my-- Dean-o will be fine
Send up a case of Cristal, two bottles of Patron, four ahi sandwiches, and a crate of skinless mangos
Vick turns to the guys: (') You guys want anything
The guys stammer, too stunned to speak
(') And have Jean-Marie cook up a dozen of those duck skewers  like so well
He knows the ones
And how would you like to pay
8
American Express
Atashir looks up to accept the card
After a beat, Vick turns to Alan: (') Dude, give him your AmEx
What
Don't worry, we'll hit you later
Alan stammers
(') Dude, come on,  paid for gas
Stop being such a Jew
Alan stammers some more -- then angrily pulls out his card
: -- The guys enter the room, jostling; Stu has Doug in a headlock
Then they freeze: the Dean Martin Suite is massive, complete with lounge area, two flat screen TVs, full bar and multiple bedrooms
The guys just gape
This is bigger than my house
Vick blows past them, totally unfazed
Get dressed, ladies
We're wheels up in ten
Stu and Doug race off to find their bedrooms, leaving Alan standing alone, just staring at the decadent suite
am so not getting paid back
--   -- Vick enters the bedroom, drops his bag, and starts changing his shirt -- when his cell phone
He answers
This is Vick
9
Vick listens -- then grows a bit panicked: (') He's in Vegas
You're kidding me
() All right, 'll get it
All right
All right--
When Stu walks past, Vick turns away and covers the phone, trying to keep the call confidential: (') said all right, dude
How many more times you want me to say all right
() All right
All right
Vick hangs up, looking uncharacteristically stressed
--  -- Doug brushes his teeth while, at the next sink over, Alan selects a facial wash from his highly organized toiletries kit and begins washing his face
So, you ready for Sunday
Yeah
thought 'd be nervous, but 'm actually just really psyched
Alan nods, impressed
Tracy's dad still hate you
Oh yeah
Any closer to figuring out why
Enh,  think he wanted more for his girl
mean, 'm a teacher who makes 45 grand a year, and he's a titan of industry who makes 45 grand a day, you know
sort of get it
(beat, brushing teeth) Also, 'm banging his daughter
'm not sure you ever get past that
10
Alan smiles, yeah, there's that
Doug spits out his paste
(') You got floss
Alan gestures towards his toiletries kit
Doug picks it up, starts looking for the floss
Then Alan remembers something -- but it's too late
Doug has found the   inside Alan's kit, and opened it to reveal a
(') Holy Christ
Alan quickly reaches for the ring-- Ahhh yeah,  wasn't going to tell anyone about that-- Just then, Stu wanders in, wearing only his His gut is sizable
Anyone got any nipple lube--
(seeing ring) Jesus would you look at the size of that thing
Stu grabs the ring from Doug
It's Alan's
For Becky
Jesus, who made this thing
Diddy
(clutching for ring) Actually, - was trying to keep it a secret, so-- Just then Vick blows in, singing, effeminate: Boy Party in the bathrooooom--
(sees ring, snags it) Miner's cut, 2
6 Carats, slight pink tint, street value: 26, 27K
Vick studies it in the light
Alan just rubs his temples
Dude, it's for Becky
Alan's finally going to propose
11
Well gosh-golly, Alan Mervish, good for you
Where'd you get the ring
Oh, it's a family heirloom
My grandmother smuggled it through the Holocaust, actually
was going to propose to Beck this weekend
Doug throws his arm around Alan, happy for him
Well: now we have two things to celebrate
: : ", 6:10 " -- The guys, dressed to the nines, open the steel rooftop door and file out onto the flat tar roof of the Mandalay Bay; Vick is carrying a bottle of Patron and four hotel glasses
Bringing up the rear, Alan slides a wood block between the door and the frame so they aren't locked up here
The guys step out onto the dark, windy roof and take in the stunning panorama
the Strip
the mountains
the countless stars
It's breathtaking
Thish is so great
love you guys
Check it out, Stu's already wasted
Vick starts refilling everyone's glasses
We've only had two shots, man
Yeah, what happened, Stuey
You used to be able to drink us all under the table
Dude, 'm a dad
don't have time to get plastered anymore
It blows
() Am  a bad dad for saying that
12
What
No
Because my dad was a bad dad
(patting his shoulder) That's true, Stuey, but you're different
We've talked about this
Stu just stares at the guys, glassy-eyed
Beat
Have  showed you guys pictures of my kids yet--
&  & Doug laughs and raises his glass for a toast, heartfelt: Little toast: to Tracy, the coolest, kindest, most beautiful woman 've ever met
can't believe she let me come this weekend -- much less agreed to spend the rest of her life with me
think both will prove to be massive errors of judgement on her part
The guys chuckle, hear-hear
(') And to being here, with my best friends in the world
There's nowhere else 'd rather be
The guys raise their glasses, touched
(') That said, let's not get too stupid tonight, okay
'm getting married in 36 hours
&  & No, no
/ We'll be good
/ Totally, dude
Doug lowers his glass, laughing, completely unconvinced
13
'm serious, dudes
Nothing above the neck -- no piercings, no weird haircuts, no facial tattoos gotta look decent on Sunday
Jesus, what do you take us for
Vick: you shaved Alan's eyebrows off the night before graduation
Oh yeah
That was hilarious
And remember when  blacked out at Homecoming and you wrote on my face with permanent marker
That was awesome
What'd you write again
&  & "Respect me
" They all laugh
Stu throws his arm around Doug, nostalgic
Ahh, good times, man
Good times
We'll be good tonight, Doug
Seriously, man, we're your friends
Yeah, we've totally grown up since then
Doug looks at them, highly dubious, then hoists his glass
Well then
to a night we'll never forget
They  glasses, shoot their shots, and : Shafts of white desert sunlight pour into 14
follows a   as it walks through the totalled suite
Furniture is broken, the minibar ransacked, and the floor is covered with remnants of the night before: empty beer cans, platefuls of room service food, a cowboy hat, the Gideon Bible, half-eaten skinless mangos, a bra, a battle axe, etc
on the couch, wearing only his jeans and one shoe, the word  written in Sharpie across his chest, is Stu
: ", 11:15AM" The chicken struts across the top of the couch, until it reaches a plastic coin cup from Bellagio blocking its path
Beat
Then the chicken pecks it off
onto Stu
The cup hits Stu in the face, and stale beer splashes all over him
Stu spastically jerks awake and flips off the couch, onto a pile of newspapers
Get off
Get off
Jesus
Confused, Stu clambers off the pile of newspapers -- to find Vick sleeping underneath, on the floor, fully dressed
Vick pulls himself onto the couch, clearly in pain
Damn, dude, why are you retarded
Both men are ragingly hungover
long beat as both of them rub their faces, then: (') Um, Stuey
Yo
Why do you have a mullet
Stu does, in fact, have a mullet haircut
But he's too hungover to understand
What
15
You know, business on top, party down the back
Stu still looks confused
This is excruciating for Vick
(') Your hair, dude
You have a mullet
Stu touches his hair
Then he stumbles into the bathroom
After a beat, we hear his voice: (
) Dude
have a mullet
Then we hear '  in the bathroom, groggy: (
) Just give me ten more minutes, Beck
(
) Whoa, did you sleep in the tub
Beat, then Stu pokes his head out of the bathroom
(') Check it out: Alan slept in the tub
Get him up
'm hungry
Stu disappears back into the bathroom
We hear the turn on
Beat
Then we hear Alan slowly awaken: (
) Wet
Water
Jesus, what's--
There's a  as Alan falls out of tub
Beat
Then Stu and a very confused, very hungover, very wet Alan stumble out of the bathroom
Alan appears to be wearing his polo shirt from the night before
Only, as we  , we see that his shirt is cut off at his chest -- he's naked from there down
Jesus, dude, put away your sack
Alan looks down at his hairy nakedness, totally bewildered
16
Yeah, and it might be time for some manscaping, bro
Your bush looks like Yanni
Alan looks back up again, squinting, hungover
What did we do last night
: -- The guys, now dressed, stagger out of their suite moments later
Stu walks incredibly bow-legged, like an aging cowboy
Dude, why is my ass killing me
-- Looking like crap, the guys silently descend in the elevator
The elevator opens to expose a - waiting to get on
They see the guys and immediately step away from the elevator
We'll
we'll get the next one
The doors close
The guys continue to descend
Beat
We might not smell very good
The guys shake their heads, yeah, no
: --   -- The guys slouch in a booth, shoveling masses of buffet food into their mouths, washing it down with huge mugs of coffee
This might be the worst hangover anyone has ever had, ever
can't taste anything
17
Please stop talking
If  don't focus on eating 'm going to throw up all over myself
The guys nod, right
They keep eating
After a long while: Hey
Are we missing something
The guys all slowly look around
Then Stu points at Alan: Yes:  left my hat in the room -- thank you, Alan
They continue eating
Alan looks up again, still troubled
No
That's not it
There's something else
Vick nods at Stu as he stuffs food in his mouth
You gonna finish that cruller
Stu shakes his head, no
Vick takes it, packs it into his already stuffed mouth
Then Alan realizes: Doug
Guys, where's Doug
The guys look around
Hunh
Yeah
He's not here
Probably left him in the room
Vick pulls out his cell phone, starts dialing
(') 'll call his cell
Then a phone  in Stu's pocket
He answers: Good morning, this is Stu
It's me, meatdick
18
(to Alan, concerned) It's Vick-- Then Stu realizes
Oh
(') This is Doug's phone
Vick nods, ya
He's already dialing another number
You calling the room
Vick nods, uh-huh
He lets it ring, rubbing his temples
Then he hangs up
No answer
Vick goes back to eating
Alan frowns
Ummm
shouldn't we look for him
Check-out is in like ten minutes
Yeah, and we told Tracy we'd have Doug back to  by five
Vick just looks at both of them, his mouth full of food: 'm eabing
What an asshole
Stu, check the pool and the casino, 'll check the room and the gym
Maybe he's working out or something
Stu nods, and they slowly slide out of the booth
(') And Vick, if you could keep a close eye on the buffet, that'd be really helpful
Thanks, man
Alan and Stu saunter off
Vick yells after them, mouth full: '
'
19
Vick scowls, and angrily takes Alan's last cruller
: -- Alan weaves through the totalled suite, half-awake
Doug
Doug
Wake up, man
Alan enters the bedroom where Doug slept, and stops
It takes him a second to realize what's wrong: There are four indentations on the carpet where it once lay
Alan scratches his head
That's weird
: --  -- Stu, walking bow-legged, squinting painfully in the bright sun, tries to inspect everyone lying around the huge pool
Doug
Doug
Several   in bikinis sit up, disgusted
No, no
It's cool, 'm a dad
It's totally cool
: -- Alan stumbles through the gym, looking for Doug
The place is packed with fit people, working out
Alan mumbles to himself: hate you all
: -- Stu wanders through the casino, calling out, incredibly loud: Two   in identical tank tops pass by, holding hands
20
Hey Stu
Hey guys
--
Then Stu registers what just happened
He stops and turns around -- enh
-- but the gay men are gone
Before he can comment, however, he sees Vick and Alan talking to Atashir at He slowly bow-legs himself over
You find Doug
No,  assume you didn't either
Stu shakes his head, no
Then Atashir hangs up his phone
There is no Doug Billings at any of the area hospitals, morgues, or police stations
The guys frown, starting to grow worried
Maybe he went for a jog
Dude
It's 120 degrees outside
Or shopping
The guys just look at him like: you're an idiot
Great
So we've officially lost Doug
His wedding is in what, 22 hours
Relax, it's Doug, he's probably crashed out on someone's couch right now
All we have to do is retrace our steps from last night, and we'll find him
21
Okay, so last night
The guys wince, trying to remember
It's painful to think
Well, we started on the roof
Right, that was like, 6ish
Then
think
we had steaks at the Palm
Yeah
Then
we played craps at the Hard Rock
maybe
That sounds right
Stu throws up his arms, already giving up
Okay, honestly
don't even remember going to dinner
vaguely recall
doing body shots at some point
Is that
maybe
'm pretty much blank after The Hard Rock
think we went to the Flamingo after that
And then,  just remember a lot of blue light
and the overpowering smell of baby oil
So that was what, 10ish
Give or take
Was Doug still with us
Vick rubs his temples, trying to fight through the hangover
22
Yes
Yes
Doug was with us tackled him
for some reason
The guys nod, okay, okay
Okay
So we only have a 13 hour window where we could've lost him
They guys frown
Shit
Stu puts his hands into his pockets, thinking
Then he feels something
matchbook
He pulls it out
It's from The Flamingo Nightclub
Hey
Look, we were at the Flamingo
long beat of silence
Then the guys hurry to an empty   and start emptying their pockets of the detritus from the night before
They find matchbooks, receipts, room keys, a valet ticket
receipt from the Rio at 10:37-- (reading it) For 600 dollars
The valet ticket says we returned here at 4:57AM
We drove last night
The guys wince, jesus
Here's a receipt from Sbarro
The meal was comped for some reason-- Why do we have a matchbook from The Golden Pony All Male Revue
The guys exchange a look, alarmed
Someone could've given that to us
23
(laughing, nervous) Yeah, totally
There's no way we went there
We're not gay
Hahaha
They frown, then stare at all the clues lined up on the blackjack table
think we should call Tracy
Absolutely not
What if Doug called her
She might know where he is
Stu shifts uncomfortably, tenderly adjusting his ass
Yeah, 'm with Alan on this one
Of course you're with Alan, you're both gutless cowards
But we're not calling Tracy
You never call the bride from the bachelor party
Ever
If my balls were on fire and Tracy was sitting next door with a tall glass of water,  still wouldn't call her
It's a rule
But shouldn't we at least tell her we're gonna be getting home late
She has a watch, she'll figure it out
think 'm beginning to see why you're always single
And  think 'm beginning to see why you're always a douche-- (clutching his ass) Guys, wait
need your help -- oh my God -- like right now
Come on
24
Jesus, what is it
: -- Vick and Alan unhappily stand in the lavish, gold-ensconsed men's room, watching Stu painfully undo his jeans
can't believe we're doing this
You don't have to look up my butt, just at it
Something is terribly, terribly wrong
Stu's jeans fall to the ground -- and everyone freezes
He's wearing a snug   - with " " written vertically down the front
In glitter
Sweet mother of mercy
Who's Roger
-- don't know
What do you think it means
What do  think it means
Well, Stuart, your ass is all torn up and you're wearing thong underwear declaring your love for another dude --  don't think we need the team for this one
You got reamed last night, man
Stu covers his mouth, horrified
'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation for this
Really
What
Alan tries to think of one
25
Yeah, maybe there isn't
Look, 'm sure Roger is a very nice, considerate young man-- Oh my God, guys: what if 'm gay
Come on, Stu, you're nowhere near cool enough
(gasping, realizing) do watch Dancing With The Stars with the kids
Oh god, that doesn't mean you're gay
But sort of
it does
Stu grows increasingly frantic
And once,  caught myself gazing at a topless photo of David Beckham
So what, he's a great-looking dude-- And then  had those weird feelings for Vick that time in middle school, remember
Everyone stops
Vick most of all
Um, what
Yeah, that weekend we were all camping --  told you this
Yeah, no you didn't
didn't
26
think 'd remember, dude
Yeah,  think we'd all remember
Yeah
had weird feelings for you that weekend
Like really hot, really gay feelings
But then they went away
Vick is just looking at him, stunned
Wait --  was there that weekend
Did you have gay feelings for me
Unbelievable
What
was a good-looking kid
Please, you're so not his type
Wait, what
Just then, a  and his   enter the men's room and see Stu standing there, pants down, in his  string
Look, Stu, one homosexual experience doesn't mean you're permanently gay, okay
lot of guys test the waters
the  and  wheel right back around and exit
All right, we're scaring the children
Let's go
The guys head for the door
Stu quickly pulls up his pants
Wait -- so have either of you tested the waters
No
We're not gay
27
Stu looks highly confused as he follows them out onto The guys power through the crowded casino, towards the exit
Stu tries to keep up, genuinely concerned
How am  going to tell my wife
Quickly, and from a great distance
Alan's hand accidentally hits a brass railing and
Jesus, what kind of father am
Alan's hand  against the railing again, and this time it registers
Alan looks down -- and stops cold
Oh my God
(really scared) You think Erin will try to take the kids--
Oh
my
God
(turning, annoyed) What now
Alan holds up the source of his : on his ring finger is a huge, tacky, silver   with a unicorn on it
(not getting it) Cool ring
Also, my Dad is gonna have a field day with this
Vick, however, recognizes the implications of the ring, and starts back towards Alan
Oh my God
Oh my God
What's the big--
(finally realizing) Oh
28
Alan steadies himself against a  , and shakily takes off the massive unicorn ring
(') Maybe it's not a wedding ring
(reading inscription) "To My Noble Husband, Alan
" The guys eyes bulge, oh shit
This is worse than my underwear
Vick takes the ring and reads the rest of the inscription: "Now & Forever Wedding Chapel
" They guys exchange a look
(') Well, at least it's a lead
Beat
Then Alan turns and   all over the slot machine
Nearby    look over, disgusted -- but continue playing their nickels
: --   -- The three guys exit the hotel looking like crap
Vick hands his ticket to the valet
Alan chews mint gum
So, we go to the wedding chapel, we find out what we did with Doug, we recover him, and we're back in before sundown
Easy as Stu's ass
No one laughs
Tense  as they wait for the car
Check it out, some idiot threw his bed out the window last night
Stu points over at a huge stone  in front of the hotel with an   impaled upon its ear
That was us, dude
29
Really
Yeah, there's no bed in Doug's room
() Oh
Well, 'm sure we had a good reason for doing it
() You think they'll charge us for--
Yeah, Stu,  really do
Guys, relax
Everything's gonna be cool
Just then the Valet drives up in ' The exterior is scratched and filthy, like it's been off- roading
The hubcaps are gone, as is the front passenger side door
wisp of  trails up from under the hood
The guys just stand there, agape
You okay, Vick
'm not emotionally prepared to talk about it just yet, Stuart, but thank you
Vick dons his sunglasses and heads for his destroyed car
: in their ridiculous car
Cars full of , cute , even , point and stare
Our guys just face forward, each quietly suffering in their own personal Hell
Seriously: what am  gonna tell Becky
For 14 years she's been begging me to get married
30
Well, now you did
Just not to her
Alan glowers at the city going by
Then he sits up-- Wait, is that homeless guy wearing Doug's shirt
The guys turn to see a   weaving down the sidewalk in Doug's    from the night before
Once they pass, the guys exchange a look
Naaah
Yeah, that was a different shirt
Alan doesn't look so sure
They drive in silence
Then: (') Left turn
Stu, sitting shotgun, braces against the empty doorframe so as not to fall out of the car as they turn left
&    -- Sitting in an East Vegas strip mall, sandwiched between a laundromat and a pawn shop, is the pink Now & Forever Wedding Chapel
The Cadillac parks in the lot out front
&    -- Everything in the small, tacky wedding chapel is white plastic
White plastic plants, white plastic cross, white plastic chairs
The guys enter
What if they don't remember us--
The guys turn to find the hirsute owner of the chapel, , 40's, in a tight white suit, his arms spread wide
Steve is all Vegas, by way of Long Island
How are you, you dumb bastards
31
He warmly hugs the guys
They have zero memory of him, and it shows as they hug back weakly, unfamiliar
(') ,
(to the guys) You here to pick up your wedding photos
Alan starts to decline, when-- Does the pope wear a funny hat
Let's do this thing
Steve  and guides them over to a table; Alan scowls
And where is Chastity today
They all sit on white plastic chairs
-Who's
Chastity
() Your wife, man--
, you're just breaking my balls
Alan looks ill
Laughing, Steve retrieves a folder and starts laying out a series of   on the table
Vick eagerly peruses them, enjoying this
Uh, it was such a lovely ceremony, wasn't it
Hand to God, 've never seen two people more in love
Sadly,  believe you
The guys look at the photos of Alan's wedding from the night before
They're typical wedding shots, only the guys are all wearing  , swords, bows, tights, even armor
They look incredibly happy -- and incredibly drunk
The next photo is of Alan and his
She's having a blast in a white medieval gown and tiara

(') Hello, Chastity
Alan just closes his eyes, oh God
am never
ever
drinking again
Jesus, she is stacked
Stu, please, show some class
That's Alan's wife you're talking about
(to Alan, guilty) Sorry
She looks really nice
But Alan is too busy gaping at the next photo, of him and Chastity atop a  in the chapel
(It is, of course, a rented pony with a lame horn strapped to its head
) We got a unicorn
Oh, yeah, you got the entire Double Camelot Package
Alan just rubs his temples, oh no
-And how much did that cost
7 thousand dollars
Alan closes his eyes
Stu and Vick exchange a look, no way
(') Yeah, you didn't want to get it, either, but Vick insisted
Beat
Then Alan pounces across the table at Vick
'm gonna kill you
(fending him off) You can't put a pricetag on love, Alan
You just can't
33
Stu hops up and starts pulling Alan off of Vick
The guys straighten like schoolboys as Steve's wife , 40's, enters
She's wearing a toga, smoking a menthol, and dollying in several large
Then she grins: Ahhh
'm just busting your nuts
She lowers the dolly and hurries over for hugs
(') Good to see you, you stupid mooks
Stu and Alan force smiles, no idea who this woman is
Vick, on the other hand, steps forward and hugs her tightly
It's good to be seen, Carla
It's good to be seen
brought the rest of your package
Carla begins unloading things from the cardboard boxes
(') First: Two dozen commuter mugs
She unpacks 24   with Alan and Chastity's photo emblazoned on them
Alan winces, oh god
Stu grabs one: No way
Awesome
hundred DVDs of the ceremony
She lays out the stacks of DVDs
Vick nods at Alan: For you and Chastity to watch on your anniversary
Alan just clenches his jaw,  fucking hate you
The velvet wall hanging
She pulls out a six foot air-brushed velvet   of Alan and Chastity riding the unicorn together in outer space
34
And it looks like real velvet, Alan, so no machine wash, okay
And the big finish: Vick and Stu do a  on the table, excited
Then Carla pulls out a     with a bas- relief of Alan and Chastity   on it
Alan just closes his eyes
,
want a shield
Me too
Hey, can Stu and  get a shield
don't suppose you have any sort of return policy, do you
Um
if you know another couple who looks exactly like you guys, and who want two dozen commuter mugs, a wall hanging, and a shield
sure
Alan scowls
Then his cellphone
He angrily answers it without looking at the Caller
What
We hear someone
Alan's eyes bulge
(') Oh, hey Becky
Hi
He steps away to take the call
Vick explains to Carla: That's his girlfriend of 14 years
'm sure this'll only take a minute
35
Vick and Stu go back to looking at the wedding photos as Alan tries to talk to his furious girlfriend
: in her Laura Ashley bedroom, angrily packing up her suitcase
She's beautiful and preppy in pearls and a sweater set
Can you tell me why all the goddamn credit cards are maxed out
No
- have no idea--
Then Vick calls over from the white plastic table, pissed: ,    ' ,
,   ,
'
Alan waves at them, shut the hell up
But Becky has heard
"Your best man
" What's going on there, Alan
Nothing
Baby, nothing, the ,     - , Alan furiously flips them off, shut up
really don't appreciate being mocked right now, Alan, especially about wedding-related issues
You know how hard this weekend is going to be for me
know, baby
know-- 36
So you'll call the credit card company and straighten this out
Yes
will
promise
Okay
Okay
(beat, calming) Look, sorry 'm so tense
'll see you soon, okay
Love you
But Alan is just staring at the   of him making out with his blonde bombshell wife
(') Alan
Hello
said  love you
Yes, no,  love you too
Becky hangs up, rolling her eyes, unbelievable
as he closes his cellphone
Exhales
Hey, how's Becky doing, man
Yeah, did she ask about us
Off of Alan's hate-filled glare, we : through the strip mall parking lot, back to their car
Alan sullenly carries the
Look on the bright side, Alan
Vick found a great clue
Turns out Doug was in all the wedding photos, which means -- if the time stamp was right -- we had him in our possession until 11 pm
37
That's another hour of last night that we can account for
Isn't that great
(bitterly sarcastic) Amazing
Hey, Steve, you don't happen to know where we were heading when we left here last night, do you
Well, the Double Camelot Package comes with a five course wedding feast, so  assume you went there
Great -- where was the feast
Sbarro, over in the Fremont mall
: (
) paid 7 grand for Sbarro
'  -- The beatup Caddy is packed with wedding crap
Vick is busy trying to reverse the overloaded car out of the parking spot
Stu's in the backseat with the huge shield, while Alan seethes up front
Your negativity is like a little black cloud over our car, Alan
You've got to let go of this
Let go of what, exactly, Vick
The fact that  married a complete stranger last night
Or that my girlfriend's about to leave me
Or that 'm broke
Which one
You're broke
thought you were -- 38
know you think it's like terminally uncool to be in a committed relationship, Vick, but actually love Becky, okay
() - honestly don't know what 'd do without her
really don't
Alan looks off, lost, sick
Vick stops the car short
Alan
Honey
Have you considered, even for a second, that maybe the things we do when we're drunk are what we secretly want to do
(dripping with sarcasm) Yeah, no, you're absolutely right, Vick, 've always secretly wanted to marry a bottle blonde with big fake melon tits named Chastity
ain't mad atcha, dude
Or, after 14 years, maybe you don't have the balls to leave Becky, and this is your way of getting her to leave you
was going to propose to her this weekend, you jackass
All the more reason to freak out
Alan opens his mouth to respond, but nothing comes out
Vick nods, chew on that, and continues slowly reversing the car
(') love you, Alan Mervish,  do, but you've always had a major pole up your ass
Maybe last night was your inner cool person trying to get out- swear to God, Vick, if you say one more word to me,  will destroy you
39
Guys, come on, let's not use our angry words-- baseball bat  the windshield
The guys all jump
Vick slams on the brakes
What the--
They look up to see two    in loud Hawaiian shirts,   and , 30's, standing on either side of the car
And they look pissed
Get out of the car, Vick
Stu and Alan recoil in terror
Who are these guys
Stu, please
(to Kalolo Fanalua) think there's been some sort of mistake, Mister
'm Mr
Shut The Hell Up And Get The Hell Outta The Car, and this is my associate, Mr
Smash You In The Teeth If You Say Another Word
(beat, to Alan) Those so aren't their real names
Vick, don't be a dick--
Alan
Relax
These men aren't going to hurt us
They're from Hawaii
Kikiolani starts viciously smashing the car
We're from Guam, bitch
Now get outta the car
40
Okay, okay
Cool it with the bat
Jesus, why is everyone trying to kill my car
Vick undoes his seatbelt   and reaches for his door handle
Kikiolani lowers his bat   -- and Vick throws the door open, right into his nuts
The   huge Samoan staggers back, , and Vick slams his door shut   and The Caddy sideswipes a car, hops the curb, and lands on the street
They  , the huge bronze shield flying out of the backseat as they do
It  on the pavement
-- Vick drives like the wind, trying to see around the huge in the windshield
Alan and Stu are freaking out
Why'd you do that
() Really
Maybe they just wanted to talk
honestly don't know how you two are still alive
Do you think we stole something from them last night
Oh my god  am such a bad dad
(producing cellphone) 'm calling the police
This is getting way out of control-- No
No cops
"No cops
" Who are you, Fitty Cent
41
Yeah, Vick, what's going on
Nothing
just think we should focus on finding Doug and not get distracted by every little thing
Every little thing
We were just assaulted by the Yakuza
Oh please, those guys are from Guam
Get a grip
They knew your name, Vick
Which means they probably know who Stu and  are, too
If anything ever happened to my family, Vick
Fine
Let's just go back to the hotel -- Doug is probably back from wherever he spent the night, we'll get him, we'll straighten out whatever we did to those angry Samoans, then we'll get the hell back to , okay
Left turn
Vick angrily takes a harder-than-necessary left turn
Alan hangs on tight, almost flying out of the car
: : ", 2:26 " -- The boys hurry into their room, stressed
Doug
Doug
Alan quickly checks the room phone
No messages
42
Come on, let's toss the place
Alan starts wading through the crap in the living room, while Vick and Stu head off to check the bedrooms
Stu brushes aside beer bottles and room service dishes, looking for anything relevant
He spots a   on the ground
Picks it up
Hey, check it out, Vick
invested 30 grand in your custard store last night
Vick calls from the other bedroom
(
) Smart move, man
Stu opens the closet door -- and freezes
Hey, you wanna come in here a sec
Vick enters a moment later to find Stu staring into the closet
Vick follows his gaze and sees a   snoring away on the closet floor, her blonde hair obscuring her face
Whoa
You think she's what those Guamian dudes wanted
No
think she's Alan's wife
Stu covers his mouth, oh shit
Vick produces the wallet- sized photos from Alan's wedding, compares them, and nods
(') Alan
Wanna step in here, buddy
second later Alan enters, what's up
(') Alan, Chastity
Chastity, Alan
Alan looks down, sees Chastity  on the closet floor, her body all contorted, and freezes
Oh my God
43
What
what am  supposed to do
Wake her up, man
Why me
Because she's your spouse, dude
Scowling, Alan slowly crouches down
Then, a little scared, he nudges her
Nothing
He nudges her harder
(') Pinch her tit
It always works
Alan shakes her a bit harder and --  -- the girl lets out a massive burp and awakens,
Alan jumps back up, terrified
The woman, , looks around, disoriented
Dang, did  sleep in the closet again
Then she notices the guys staring down at her
She smiles, recognizing them: (') Oh hey, guys
What's up
She shakily climbs to her feet to expose a skimpy skirt, a snug tube top, and mascara smeared all over her face
The guys have no idea what to say
She kisses Alan on the cheek, very intimate -- like, well, a husband and wife
(') Morning, honey
She exits into the living room, picking her wedgie
Beat
Alan is speechless
She seems really cool
Yeah,  really like her, man
44
-- Chastity gathers her belongings -- jacket, purse,  string -- from around the totalled living room
The guys file in
So, um, did you take Alan's name
Yeah, are you Chastity Mervish now--
Listen to me
Just
did we, or did we not, have sex last night
Alan braces, please say no, please say no
Vick braces, please say yes, please say yes
Well
ya
Alan slumps, his life over
Vick pumps his fist,
(') But we waited til we were married
Alan
What a responsible, upstanding young Jew
They don't make `em like that anymore, am  right
Chastity smiles, sweet, as she straps on her 6 inch heels
know -- he even wanted to use a rubber
Alan breaks into a
Wait-- we didn't use a condom
It's cool,  sponge
Alan leans against a wall, dizzy
Can someone
please open a window
45
Stu turns and tries to open a window
No luck
They don't open
So you guys don't remember any of last night
Yeah, not so much
Hey, been there before, right
(grabbing her sizable bra) Sucks, though
The wedding was really fun
'm bummed you don't remember it, Alan
She smiles, a little saddened
Stu whispers to Alan: Dude,  think your wife's mad at you
You don't happen to remember what time we met you last night, do you
Sure, we met at the bar at like 10:00
Then we got married on my smoke break, which was like 11:00
It's the All-American love story, isn't it
What happened next
Well,  had to go back to work
But when  got off at 5:30,  met up with you guys back here
And was Doug with us then
No
Interesting
Do you have any idea where we went after the wedding
46
No, but  bet some of my work friends do
You were partying with them pretty hard
Work friends
: Dozens of `em, dancing, grinding, shimmying on poles
'  -- Chastity leads the guys through Vegas's Most Notorious Strip Club, The Crazy Horse
It's bacchanalia writ large, complete with throbbing music, flashing strobe lights, and six stages of spinning flesh
The place is mobbed with
Alan follows after Chastity, horrified
You work here
Behind him, Vick   with Stu, psyched
Yeah -- and this is the pole where we first met
She stops at a pole, around which a currently spins
Alan looks ill
(') It's always been my lucky pole
Look,  don't know how to tell you this, but-- ,
She holds up her hand, showing off ' ' to the stripper currently upside-down on the pole
Get it, girl
Come on, let's go meet my bridesmaids
47
She hurries off, but Alan can't move
Dude
know
The Holocaust, man
Alan just stares into space
Vick takes him by the shoulder
Look, we can get your grandmother's ring back
We just gotta go about it in the right way
have besmirched my people
Don't be so hard on yourself, dude-- Just then Chastity runs back over with two
These were my bridesmaids, Anastasia and Starr
Hey, boys
Good to see you again
Mazel Tov--
Please
don't
Just then a  finds Chastity and Alan, and the up in the booth comes over the
system: ,
' - ,
The entire club
Chastity holds up her wedding ring and dances around,
Alan waves meekly
Thanks
, ' -- 48
The  puts on Nine Inch Nails' " Want to Fuck You Like An Animal" and the club gets hopping again
Oh my God, he's playing our song
(giddy, to Alan) This song was playing when we met, remember
You kept sliding twenties into my thong and saying " will always love you
will always love you
" Alan closes his eyes
Twenties
Yeah, it was so sweet
Look,  don't know how to say this, but my friends and  were very drunk last night
We would never come to a place like this-- He glances over at Vick and Stu -- but they're gone
(') Guys
: and downing them
to see that they are sitting in getting lapdances from  and
The Champagne Room is a dark, plush private suite in the back of the Crazy Horse where strippers ply their craft; the room is half full
Vick watches Starr lean over and make out with Anastasia
You are the best bridesmaids ever
(huge boobs in his face) Dude:  might not be gay
Then Alan hurries in with Chastity; he looks pissed
49
What the hell are you doing
Two-for-ones, man
We don't have time for this
We gotta find Doug
What do you think we're doing
What
We're getting into the mindset of last night, to see if it sparks any memories
(to his stripper) Now: is this exactly how you were dancing for me last night, Starr
She nods
Vick nods, pensive, scientific
(') Yeah, still no memories
Keep going -- and put your back into it
You are so goddamn selfish, Vick
You really are
Stu, let's go
No
Stu, sit and enjoy your dance
Stu looks between them, torn
Dude: Doug is missing
We have less than 18 hours til his wedding
We do not have time for this
'm trying to save your life here, Alan Mervish
Vick--
50
'm not kidding, man
Life is one long series of emergencies, and if you don't learn to stop and have a little fun along the way, you're gonna grow into a joyless old prick like your dad
'm sorry to bring Moshe Mervish into it, but it had to be said
Now yes, we have 18 hours to find Doug -- which means we can afford to spend ten minutes celebrating the special talents of these gifted young body-artists
So sit down, have a jager shot, and smell the goddamn roses for once in your miserable life
Chastity, honey
When you're ready
Chastity pushes Alan onto the red leather banquette and starts dancing for him
He tries to squirm away: No, look--  am like totally against this, morally and politically
Plus Becky specifically asked me not to-- : , as Chastity works a wildly erotic lapdance on him
She crawls onto his lap, she whips him with her long hair, she puts her tongue in his ear
Next to him, no longer getting lapdances, Vick and Stu just sit, staring at Chastity, entranced
think  know why he married her
Because if he hadn't,  would've
They continue watching on in silence
Is it weird that we're sitting this close watching
Not for me
More watching in silence
51
really shouldn't be here
have daughters
Then both of their heads angle the same way
Not that can do that
How can she do that without dislocating her hip
Because she's been touched by God
They continue staring, amazed
Just then, the door is kicked open and  and   burst into the Champagne Room, peering through the darkness, looking for our guys
Vick and Stu see them immediately
(') Shit
They both hop up
Alan remains sitting, however, hypnotized by Chastity
Vick grabs him
(') Alan, come on, man, we gotta go
Whoa, whoa, 'm smelling the roses-- Vick literally yanks Alan up from the banquette
Come on, man
We got company
Finally, the Guamians spot the guys and lumber for them
(') Chastity, honey, is there a back way out of here
Thinking fast, Chastity grabs her clothes and darts over to a darkened, unlabeled
Come on
The guys race after her
52
-- Chastity and the guys sprint through the bright, crowded back hallways of the Crazy Horse, weaving through strippers, cocktail waitresses, and barbacks
Behind them, the two massive Samoans try to follow, but are slowed by all the foot traffic
Strippers  as they're bowled over by the obese Islanders
-- spotlight holds on a   covering the main stage
Some sort of techno Limp Bizkit song is playing
(
) , All the patrons turn their attention to Stage One -- then Stu blows through the curtain, out of breath
Beat
The patrons look at Stu, confused
Stu looks at them, equally so
The patrons start to , just as Vick, Chastity, and Alan blow through the curtain after Stu
Come on
Chastity, in six inch leucite heels, sprints down the main runway, leaps over the patrons sitting at the end, and hits the floor running
Did she just do that in heels
'm really starting to like this girl
The guys all follow suit, sprinting down the runway and leaping over the patrons
Then the Guamians blow through the curtain, panting, very upset
They lumber down the stage -- and the patrons at the end of the runway clear the hell out of the way
Upsetting cocktails, hopping onto stages and then off again, leaping over chairs, spinning around stripper poles, and, finally, sprinting out the front door
53
The massive Guamians give chase, leaving a wide trail of destruction behind them, like two elephants trampling through a forest
Just as they're blowing out of the door, however, ' being swung into their chests
They both stumble backwards, and then four roided-up pounce on them, wrestling them to the ground
(to walkie talkie) Viper One, this is Rolling Thunder, we've subdued the targets, over
-- Chastity and the guys hurry around the corner from the Crazy Horse, laughing, exhilarated from the chase
Did you see them trample those tiny Japanese businessmen
think they killed like four of them
Everyone laughs
Vick puts his arm around Alan
Come on, Alan: tell me that wasn't just a little fun
That was
a little fun
Vick smiles -- just as a     hops the curb, lights flashing, and cuts them off
Two mustachioed  get out and hurry for them, pointing, intense
Victor Lennon
Alan Mervish
Stuart Pryce
() -Yes
You're coming with us
: 54
--   -- The two  cops,   and  , 40's, pace about this bare interrogation room, while Vick, Alan and Stu sit behind the cold metal table
Vick looks tense, but in control
Stu and Alan are sweating, terrified
They've clearly been here a while
Where were you last night at 3am
No idea
Okay, how about at 2am
Ditto
Officer Bladen  the table with his fist
You think this is cute, son
You think this is a game
Whatever we did, we're so sorry
Honestly, man,  will confess to anything you want
Stu: stop talking
Alan: sit up straight
Officer Merriweather, 've told you twelve times now: we have no memory of last night
Now either charge us with a crime, or let us go
Merriweather scowls and nods at Bladen, who steps over to a and turns it on
Merriweather, meanwhile, pulls out a photograph of a slick   in a red suit, slides it onto the table
What do you know about Jimmy Lang
Vick flinches ever-so-slightly, clearly knowing something
Stu and Alan just look at the photograph, confused
55
Nothing
Who is he
Jimmy Lang runs the infamous Shiang- Xi crime organization, and is wanted in seven states for money laundering, drug smuggling, racketeering and murder
Oh my god-- Did we kill someone last night--
We have no idea who this man is
Is that right
Yeah, that's right
, grainy surveillance camera footage of a birthday party starts playing
In the video,   sits in an upscale restaurant, in front of a  , as a table full of hip   serenade him with "Happy Birthday To You
" When the guys sitting next to Jimmy lean forward to help him blow out the candles on his cake, however, we see that it's Vick, , , , and some  , all very drunk
&  &  &  ( ) , Everyone applauds
Vick drunkenly hugs Jimmy Lang
( ) love you, Jimmy Lang
Merriweather   on Vick kissing the top of Jimmy Lang's shaved head
In the interrogation room, Vick, Stu and Alan sit, frozen
Silence
56
We're in a lot of trouble, aren't we
Officers,  swear, we have no memory of that ever occurring-- Okay
Maybe a night in jail will jostle something loose
Oh no, sir, please don't
We have a very important wedding--
know Jimmy Lang
Everyone stops, looks at Vick
You do
Jimmy and  tried to raise capital for Girl-nasium, a 24 hour fitness center and day spa for tween-age girls, but it never got off the ground
It was an entirely legitimate enterprise --  had no idea he was a criminal
We must've bumped into him last night, and he must've invited us to join his birthday celebration
No crime in that, is there, Officers
Merriweather gets in Vick's face, intense
You actually expect me to believe that dung
() Yes, Officer Merriweather
do
If  find out you're lying to me, son,  will take all of you down, is that clear
57
You boys wouldn't last three hours in prison
Stu might
Stu shakes his head, unbelievable
(') Now: are you gonna charge us with something, or are we free to go
The cops look at each other, scowling
Beat
Get outta here
Stu and Alan quickly hop to their feet and make for the door
Oh, thank you, Officers
It was really nice meeting you--
If you know what's good for you, you'll get the hell out of Vegas
: -- Day has turned to night
Vick, Stu, and Alan descend the steps of the police station
The mood is grim
Did you have to be such a dick
We got out, didn't we
Yeah, four hours later
If we'd just cooperated with them-- If we'd cooperated with them, we'd be in jail right now, Alan
They reach the curb, and Stu starts trying to hail a cab
Desperation is setting in
58
What are we gonna do now
We've got zero leads on where Doug is
Why hasn't he called
It's 8:30
The guys shake their heads,  don't know
(') Do you think he's okay--
Stu, don't
Doug is fine
mean, we were hanging out with mobsters last night, man
They kill people for looking at `em weird--
Stu: Doug is fine
Or what if we like drove Doug out to the desert and left him, just as like a funny prank--
Stu
Enough
() knew  shouldn't have come
What did you just say
said  knew  shouldn't have come this weekend, Vick
(getting heated) Is that right
Yeah, that's right
only came because Doug insisted
Vick steps towards Alan, heated
59
Why do think you're so much better than us, dude
don't --  just think 'm better than you, Vick
And trust me, it's not that hard
You haven't changed one bit since high school
Jesus, you're 28 years old and you still talk back to cops
Really
You're out of your depth, Alan-- And you're still the one getting us in trouble
Only then it was hiding your weed in our locker, and now you've got us partying with wanted felons
It's not cute anymore, man
We're too old for this
Vick scowls; this is actually hitting home
(') And all your stupid get-rich-quick schemes
Girl-nasium
Custard
In Los Angeles
Are you joking
Okay, let's all take a breath-- When's the last time you had a real job, man
When's the last time you had a girlfriend
Hell, when's the last time you picked up the check
What's so great about any of those things
Those "things," Vick, are what grown men do
Vick swallows, furious
Look, we're all tired and hungry-- 60
None of us ever liked you, Alan
We only hung out with you because Doug made us
Alan recoils, whoa, stung
This is clearly news to him
Stu
Is that true
Stu gestures, uncomfortable, enh, who's to say
Alan nods, see, his face reddening
Why would anyone like you, dude
Have you ever thought about that
You're uptight, you're judgemental, you're cheap, and yet somehow you think you're sweeter than everyone else
Well look around, man: no one wants to be you
'd rather be Stu than you
Wait, what--
Too late: Alan charges Vick and  him onto the lawn
They roll on the ground, trying to punch each other, but it ends up being a mess of half-chops, pulled hair, and hands in each other's faces
've
always
hated you
You punch like
your sister
Stu runs over and jumps in, trying to break them apart
Hey, no
Time out
We all need a time out--
Stu is accidentally kicked in the face and goes down
Alan and Vick continue rolling on the lawn, trying to beat the crap out of each other
They could be kids again
Then, just when it starts getting way too intense, And all three of them look up to see Vick' - parked on the curb, Chastity at the wheel
61
That might not be like, the smartest place to fight
Vick and Alan look over at the huge sign right next to them
They frown
: -- Vick's car sits parked in front of a country bar
-- The guys sit at a booth, their hair a mess, their faces bruised, their clothing ripped, ravenously chowing down on Stu's mouth is full of food: Good call on happy hour, Chastity
These tacos kick ass
Yeah,  always come here when  get out of jail
The guys exchange a quick look
Hey -- how'd you start Vick's car
Oh, my daddy taught me how to hotwire almost anything
That's funny, because Alan's daddy taught him tax law
Chastity smiles, a little confused
Alan is quick to retort: And Vick's daddy taught him how to get really drunk at his kid's soccer games and then piss himself
It's a disease, dude--
Guys, come on
For Doug
62
Alan and Vick angrily continue eating their tacos
Then Stu's rings
He pulls it out, reads the caller
(') "Number blocked
" Don't answer it
Answer it
What if it's Doug
What if it's Tracy
(torn, answers phone) Good evening, this is Stu
: -- It's Tracy
She's sitting in her living room, on the phone
Her   sits nearby, as do other
Stu, it's Tracy
His eyes bulging, Stu covers the phone and hisses: It's Tracy
Vick glares at Alan
Alan looks away, shit
(') Why is she calling me
Because she knows you're the most easily tricked
We have tell her we lost Doug
No we don't
Tell her nothing, Stu
Stu turns back to the phone, rattled
Hey, Trace
-What's going on
63
Oh, nothing, just here with my family
Wow, that sounds amazing
Yeah
Hey, you wouldn't happen to know where Doug is, would you
He said he'd be home by 5 for this dinner, and now it's almost 9:00 tried his cell, but he didn't answer
Ummmm
Hang on
(covering the mouthpiece) She wants to know where Doug is
'm working on it
Buy us some time
No, just tell her the truth
Honesty is always the best policy
What are you, retarded
Honesty is never the best policy
Especially not with brides
(lamely, to phone) Um, what'd you say
() asked if you knew where Doug was
Yeah, um, hang on
(to guys) She still wants to know
Okay: tell her Alan got really drunk last night and fell down, and the doctor said not to move him for a few hours, but that we'll be back in time for the wedding
64
Why do  have to be the one that fell over drunk
It's a fictitious canard, Alan, get over yourself
Stu: tell her
( ) Listen, Tracy, Alan fell on a -- Fell over drunk
-He was drunk
And the doctor -- a different doctor, not the one he fell on -- he said we couldn't move him until the wedding-- For a few hours
We'll be home before the wedding
But we're going to have the wedding at your home-- Tracy just looks really confused
Exasperated, Vick rips the phone away from Stu
Tracy
Vick
How are ya, hon
(now very concerned) Vick, what is going on
Nothing
Stu is a moron
Listen, Alan hurt his back last night, so we're gonna be laid up here for a bit, but  promise we'll have Doug home in time for the wedding, okay
Oh God, is Alan all right
65
Yes, luckily he had a steel rod surgically implanted up his ass at birth, so the doctors anticipate a complete and swift recovery
Alan flips him the bird
Can  talk to Doug
What
No
No, you can't actually, Doug
Doug is out
Where is he
Where is he
He's aaaat
the pharmacy
Yeah, picking up Alan's medications
Listen, Trace, 'm losing you, but we'll see you tomorrow, okay
Bye, sweetie--
Vick hangs up and nods confidently
(') She bought it
: -- Back in her bungalow, Tracy hangs up the phone, frowning
They've done something stupid
Her stern father is standing there, frowning
No surprise there
-- 'm just saying, what kind of man stands up his fiancee the night before their wedding
66
Dad,  don't want to hear it trust Doug absolutely
Mr
Turner backs off
Tracy, however, looks a bit rattled
: -- The guys get up from the booth and head for the door, grim
Perfect
We just told Tracy we'd have Doug home in 13 hours, and we still have no idea where he is
They pass a  on their way out, who's standing with a stamp and a  light reader
Handstamp for re-entry
Handstamp for re-entry
Everyone waves, no thanks -- except for Stu, who shrugs, why not, and stops, holding out his hand
Maybe we should go back to the hotel and-- Oh my God, guys
Look
Stu holds his hand under the  light -- it's covered in from all the clubs they've been to the night before
Stu yanks up his sleeve to reveal his   , completely covered with stamps
The guys hurry back and slide their forearms under the light, too: they all have the same stamps
Their eyes alight: It's like a map of last night
The guys look at each other, hope returning to their faces
: : ", 9:10PM" 67
/
'  -- The guys rocket down the Strip, weaving in and out of traffic
All the stamps on Stu's arm are now labelled in regular ink
blares, and the mood is high
Where do you want to start
At the top
We hit every club we went to til someone remembers what we did with Doug
Nice clue, Stuey
can't believe we're actually gonna pull this off
Stu grins over at the car next to them
Then he stops
Hey: is that guy wearing Doug's hat
The guys look over to see that the  of the next car over is, in fact, wearing the  - Doug was wearing last night
The guy turns off the Strip
Naaah, couldn't be
Lots of people have hats like that
Stu nods, yeah,  guess
: ' The first bar written on it is "GhostBar
" : -- Chastity and the guys blow in, each with a photo of Doug (in medieval armor) from Alan's wedding
As they move into the club, every single waiter, bartender, and busboy sees them and throws open their arms, heyyyy, remembering them
They flash the picture of Doug to anyone who'll look -- waiters, maitre d's, thugs, bachelorettes, fetishists, bikers, swingers, brides and grooms -- but all of them shake their heads, we have no idea where Doug is
68
'  -- Stu crosses off "GhostBar" from his arm
-- The guys and Chastity enter and disperse
Again, everyone recognizes them and hugs them like returning heroes -- and again, no one remembers where they were taking Doug
'  -- Stu crosses off another stamp from his arm
-- The  recognizes the guys from the night before and unclips the rope, letting them in past the immense line
-- The  recognizes the guys from the night before and unclips the rope, letting them in past the immense line
-- The  recognizes the guys from the night before and unclips the rope, letting them in past the immense line
'  -- The guys race through a shadier, more industrial area of town, their hopes dimming
All right, this is the last place we went, "Chaps
" Vick rolls to a stop in front of
It takes a moment for the guys to realize that everyone in line is male, buff, and wearing erotic cowboy gear
You sure we came here
Then they look up at the marquee
It reads ": " The Golden Pony
That's us
69
Maybe 'll just wait in the car-- But Vick is already shoving Stu out of the car
-- The guys walk into the massive nightclub and stop
It's got a kitschy barn theme, and hosts 200   in cowboy hats and short-shorts grinding on each other
You think we would've remembered this
Yeah,  don't think we came here
Then why is your underwear nailed to the wall
The guys turn to see numerous pairs of '  nailed to the wall nearby
sign above it reads " " We recognize Stu's
Those could be anybody's
Thousands of people go to Colorado State-- (looking more closely) Oh my God, are they autographed
() "Stu Pryce, 9/30/08
Chaps
" (realizing, stunned) am so gay
Just then, a   in assless chaps blows by, smiling
Hey, guys
Roger is backstage
The guys look at each other, eyes wide
-Roger
70
-- The guys move through the throng of undulating, sweaty men, uncomfortable
Alan takes Chastity's hand tightly
Stay very close to me
She smiles and dances through the crowd
-- They reach a    guarding the backstage area
He sees the guys and unclips the  , kissing each of them on the cheek as they pass
How are Haylee and Kaitlin
(totally disturbed) Oh
-Good, thanks
-- The guys reach the dressing room door and stop
They inhale
We're going to love you either way, Stu
Stu nods, focussed, nervous, like before a big game
Some of my best friends are gay
Is that true
Not
not really
live in Connecticut, man, we don't even have black people yet
Stu nods, right
Then, after steeling himself, he enters
-- The dressing room is packed with muscular, tan, buck-naked men, walking around, rubbing baby oil on themselves, donning chaps and codpieces, getting ready for the next show
71
Chastity and the guys move through the mob of beefcake, staying ridiculously close together
Vick stops at one dancer, trying not to look down at his junk: Excuse me, friend, can you tell me where Roger is
Oh, hey, Vick
Roger's over there
He points to a really hot, really naked guy with a funky mullet, stretching out in front of his mirror
The guys shuffle over to him
Vick tries to be supportive with Stu: He's cute
guess
Stu shrugs, yeah,  guess
As they draw close, Roger sees them, and smiles
Oh
Hey guys
He hugs all of them
The guys make sure to keep their asses arched back to avoid genital contact
(') 'm surprised you're even walking yet, Stu
(inhaling sharply) Oh my god
Listen, man, we don't really remember what happened last night, can you fill us in
Really
No memory
Stu shakes his head, wide-eyed, scared
(') Well,  must say, Stu, 'm a little hurt
Did we
you know
do anything
Well, duh
Yeah
72
The guys all freeze
beat
Then Vick pats Stu's shoulder, supportive
Was
the boy or the girl
Oh, honey, you were everything
Stu
Vick and Alan exchange a look, holy shit
(') But you were nothing like Vick
Wait-- what
know, 'm sort of over group stuff too, but Alan insisted
Now it's Alan's turn to look stunned
You insisted
Why'd you insist
don't know
don't know why insisted
Actually, after the anger went away, it was really quite tender
The guys look at each other, nauseous
'm really not sure we can be friends anymore
Finally, Chastity starts
Guys: he's kidding
Roger breaks into a smile and slaps five with Chastity
The guys all exhale, incredibly relieved
Not cool, Roger
Not cool
So what did happen last night
73
Oh, well, you guys came in near the end of our last set, like 2ish
Doug pretty much dragged you in
Really
Doug did
Oh no, my Doug, not your Doug
Black guy, shaved head
The guys look at each other, confused
(') He's a cake designer, he said he met you guys at some sort of birthday party at the Rio
(snapping his finger) The guy from the Jimmy Lang surveillance video
The guys nod, right
Anyway, for the big finale of our show, we always bring someone on stage, and, well, Stu, you volunteered pretty aggressively
(to nearby dancer) Hey Dallas, do we have the video of last night's show
No
That's cool,  don't need to see it-- We must see that video
It's in the machine
Roger nods and presses  on a little / combo sitting in front of his mirror
a very Brokeback, Chippendale's-style male revue starts playing
Stu
Roger fast forwards
74
You were pretty mellow at first, Stu, but once we got you into the chaps, you really came alive-- oh, here it is
we see Stu, wearing only his "    " g-string and assless chaps, grinding on stage with the Golden Pony dancers
He is way fatter, paler, and hairier than the greased young studs
The guys look away, oooo
'm a Dad, - don't get to the gym as much as 'd like
You even taught us The Pony, which we'd never even heard of before
Stu gets on all fours on the stage, and eagerly gestures for the dancers to take turns "riding" him
Stu's face drops
(') And then, of course, the piece de resistance: the Ride of the Valkyries
Stu clutches onto Roger from behind as they ride a    together
The crowd goes wild
Annnnd that would explain the searing ass pain
After the show, we split a couple pitchers of flirtinis, you had our stylist cut your hair like mine, and then you split
And what time was all this
4:30 in the morning
4:45
And our Doug was with us
75
Yeah, he had passed out by then, but you carried him out
It was all very Officer And  Gentleman
The guys look at each other, confused
Wait, so we left with Doug at 4:45, we got back to the hotel at 5:00, and Doug was gone by 5:30 when Chastity met back up with us
That doesn't make any sense
Did we lose him along the way
He was passed out, how far could he have gone--
Just then, Vick's cellphone rings
The caller  reads "
" He answers: Hello
: -- Atashir is on the phone at the reception desk
Mr
Lennon
Atashir, many greetings to you
thought you might like to know that one of our maids just found your friend, Douglas, passed out in your room
Vick's jaw drops
What
Are you sure it's him
76
saw him with my own eyes
He is unconscious but breathing nicely
Oh thank you, Atashir
You are a man of great honor
thousand blessings upon your ancestors
Vick  his phone shut, overjoyed
(') Doug is in the room
maid just found him
He's passed out, but he's okay
They're sure it's him
Atashir swears it is
The guys all laugh, a massive weight lifted
Oh thank God he's okay
After all this
He's in the room
They keep laughing and hug each other, heartfelt
Vick even hugs Roger
don't even care
Hug me, you big shiny homosexual
-- Chastity and the guys bound out of Chaps, jubilant
Stu is carrying a box of
That was cool of Roger to give you all the tapes of your performance
know, if  actually was gay, 'd totally date Roger first
What a gentle soul
They get into Vick's clunker
77
How we doing on time
(looking at watch) 2:22
We'll be in  by dawn
(firing up engine) told you bitches this would all work out
They drive off into the night, grins all around
/
'  -- Vick drives, Stu sits shotgun
Alan sits in the back with Chastity
The cool night air washes over them
They look happily exhausted
This has officially been the craziest weekend of my life
(to Chastity) Thanks for all your help
You were awesome
Anything for my hubby
Alan's smile flickers slightly
(') 'm kidding, Alan
know last night wasn't, you know, real
She looks out at Vegas as it flies by
'm sorry about all this, Chastity
Jennifer
Beg pardon
My name is Jennifer
Jennifer Elly
Alan hesitates; suddenly she seems a lot more
human
78
Okay, well, 'm sorry, Jennifer
Oh, don't be
Last night wasn't the first flaky decision 've ever made in my life
mean,  am a stripper
Alan tries not to laugh
She smiles, a twinge sadly
Where you from
Tarzana
Oh yeah
Yeah
work here on the weekends
You fly out every week
Yeah
'd move, but my kid is in a great school
Kid
(aside, to Stu) They always have kids
have a little girl, Sarah
She's
Well, she's everything
Chastity proudly shows Alan a photo from her purse of a cute little toddler
Alan smiles
(') What about you
No kids
Same girlfriend for 14 years
Becky
Alan shows her a photo of Becky on his cellphone
79
Wow, she's stunning
Stu turns around, unable to keep quiet any longer: We like you way better
Chastity tries to stymie her laugh
(') Becky is great
Becky collects teapots
Yeah, she's a total canwego
what
You know, she's the girl at the party who's always like "Can we go
Can we go
" Chastity laughs
Alan does too, shaking his head
She has low blood sugar
She has low fun sugar
Jesus, guys
This is the girl 'm going to marry
(beat, considers) If, you know
she forgives me for cheating on her
Wait: you're going to tell her
Of course 'm going to tell her could never keep something like that from her
80
Dude, she still hasn't forgiven me for scratching her Queensryche in sixth grade -- she's neeeeever gonna forgive you for marrying a stripper in Vegas
Well, then that's just the price 'm going to have to pay
Alan looks off, stoic
Chastity pats his hand, proud
Good for you
She smiles at Alan, impressed, pulling her hair from her face
Alan looks at her anew
It's a sweet moment
She's gonna cut your dick off, dude
: -- Lamborghini's, Ferrari's and Hummer limos clog the valet stand
Vick rolls up in his clunker
The guys hop out
(to the valet) Keep `er close, Paco
We'll be right back
--  -- Chastity and the guys hurry down the hallway to their suite
Vick unlocks their door and pushes inside
Doug
Wake up, man
-- Instead of finding Doug, however, they find  , sitting on their couch, pissed
He's got a huge   on his right arm, courtesy of the strip club bouncers
Aloha, assholes
The guys freeze
81
Uh-oh
The door  behind them, and they whip around to see standing in front of the door, blocking their exit
He has an identical  on his right arm
(') Not good
Just then, a toilet  and an immensely large man in a red suit exits the bathroom, drying his hands
We recognize him from his police photo as crime boss  , 50's
Oh, hello
Good to see you again
Where is Doug
Listen, Mr
Lang, whatever we did last night, we are incredibly sorry- These your rich friends you were telling me about, Vick
Alan and Stu glance at Vick, confused
(') Oh, you haven't told them yet
Really, that's low
Even for you
What's going on, Vick
Vick stammers, trying to find the words
Six months ago, your friend Vick borrowed some money from me at what can only be described as a very unfavorable interest rate
When the loan came due, he failed to pay me back, but he promised me that he could get the money from you guys this weekend
Alan and Stu look at Vick, shocked and hurt
Jesus, Vick
82
How could you do this to us, man
We're your best friends
Vick looks away, ashamed
They were gonna hurt me, man
Well, Vick, it looks like you and your friends have some issues to discuss
In the meantime
He draws a huge, red-plated
357
(') need my goddamn money
The guys jump back, whoa
Vick holds up his hands: can get it
can
just-- 've heard that before, Vick, including last night, when you so rudely skipped out on my birthday party
That's why 've taken some collateral to ensure your payment
His name is Doug
The guys all look sick
You have Doug
Oh my God
If you want your friend to live, meet me at mile marker 26 off Highway 12 at dawn, and bring the money
Are we clear
Yes
Yes
Jimmy nods and heads for the door
The Samoans follow him
--Mr
Lang
83
Yes, Mr
Mervish
-How much does Vick owe
: (
) (') 200 thousand dollars
-- Alan and Stu pace about the suite, beyond stressed
Vick stands, looking out the window
Chastity gets them all water
How the hell could you blow that kind of money
Was it for the custard store
Jesus, Stu, wake up
There is no custard store
Vick was just trying to rip us off to pay back Jimmy Lang
Is that true, Vick
Vick just stares out at the city, not denying it
(') Were any of your deals
real
() Some
Stu drops onto the couch, deeply disillusioned
Dude,  manage an Applebee's, that money meant something to me
Vick spins around, furious: Do you really think  wanted my life to turn out like this, Stu
Do you really think  don't know that 'm a massive loser
() 84
(') Jesus, you guys got out of high school and you just knew what to do, you went to college and got good jobs and found cool wives and made beautiful children -- what do have to show for the last decade of my life
Nothing
Vick swats a lamp off a nearby end-table -- it against the wall
The guys freeze
Tense silence
Vick grows emotional
(') Jesus, 'm almost 30, and the only thing  really have
the only thing  really have is you guys
Come on, Vick-- No, man, it's true
put on a good show, but my life is so goddamn hollow and vapid and lonely, it scares me, man
- don't know how much longer  can keep this scam going
And now 've gone and ruined the one good thing  had
Tears threaten in his eyes
He wipes at them, angry
(') Just
please don't give up on me, okay
- don't know what 'd do without you guys
really don't
Alan and Stu exchange a look
They've never seen brash, cocky Vick this vulnerable before
Stu can't help but give in
Come on, man, we've been bro's since third grade, it's gonna take a lot more than money to ruin our friendship
Vick looks down, deeply touched
(') What  don't understand is why you didn't just ask me for the money would've given you every last cent had, man
85
Tears trail down Vick's cheeks
He crosses and gives Stu a hug
Stu hugs back, emotional
(') love you, man
Love you too, bro
Love you too
They hug tight
For a while
Also,  banged your sister sophomore year
Vick pulls away
What
Sorry
Just seemed like a good time to tell you
Vick stammers at Stu, speechless
(') She had just broken up with that guy from Central, we were playing " Never" at Tim Donahee's pool, one thing lead to another-- No
No
That's
that's plenty
Vick desperately tries to clear the image from his mind
Alan just frowns at his watch, stressed
Look, 'm glad we're all sharing, but we've got three hours to come up with 200 grand, or else
The guys nod, frowning, back on point
(') 'd offer to take a loan out, but it's 3 o'clock in the morning, 'm pretty sure my bank is closed
think  can get a 20 grand cash advance on my credit card
86
So that just leaves 180 grand
The guys frown at each other
Well, it is Vegas
The guys' eyebrows all rise, you think
: The guys erupt in  around him,
The dealer slides over a large pile of
: Again the guys erupt
Alan hugs Chastity
Their pile of grows
: "" The guys jump up, slapping ten,
Stu points at a table full of   nearby: in your face
: , , looking lost
Then they take their large stack of chips and quietly leave
No one knows how to play Pai Gow poker
: having just won
Chastity and the guys aggressively hug him
Stu drinks from his glass, hands shaking, wired
Time check
(looking at watch) 12 minutes
Chip check
87
Alan quickly counts the chips
(') Faster
Come on chip check
Dude, how many Red Bulls have you had
stopped counting at six
can hear my heart beating in my head
Alan finishes counting the chips -- and frowns
Just over 100 grand
The guys wince, damn
There's only one thing left to do
They all exchange a knowing look
: $100,000 at a roulette table
The guys sweat, tense
Stu is insane
You sure we don't want red
What if the ball lands on red--
Shut up, Stu
Betting is closed
The Croupier drops the ball into the wheel
It bounces, hops, spins
Vick crosses himself
Stu looks away
can't watch
My   heart's gonna explode
Can your   heart even explode
Because    think my heart is gonna explode
can't watch
The ball lands
Dead silence
88
(') It's red, isn't it
knew it
Tell me it's not red
It's not red
Stu turns, ecstatic-- (') It's green
The ball has stopped on green,
Stu clutches his chest, like he's having a seizure
Vick inhales, grim
Alan slowly drops to his knees
Chastity closes her eyes
Their     is raked off the table
: --   -- - The guys pack their bags into Vick's beat-up Caddy
The mood is as dark as the pre-dawn sky
When the car is loaded, Chastity takes Alan's hands, gentle
Would you like me to come with
No
It might get a little dangerous
wouldn't want
He trails off
Chastity nods
'm so sorry
about everything
Thanks for all your help
Awkward silence
The cold desert wind blows
There's no sense
in exchanging numbers or anything
right
Yeah, probably not
Alan looks genuinely sad
89
Well
'll always remember you as a great first husband, then
They both smile weakly
(') You can just send the divorce papers to the Crazy Horse or whatever
Alan nods, okay
Another awkward pause
(') Thanks for reminding me that there are still some really good guys out there, Alan
don't
don't get to meet too many of them
She smiles a bit sadly, kisses him on the cheek, and walks off
Alan's Grandmother's ring still on her finger
Alan doesn't remember the ring, however; he's too busy watching her walk out of his life, and feeling a real sense of loss
Then Vick fires up the car next to him
We gotta go, man
Alan nods, yeah, and gets in the car
'  -- - Vick's car races down a dark, abandoned desert highway
The guys look tired, stressed, and most of all, scared
Yep, just driving out to the middle of desert to meet some mobsters, what could possibly go wrong
The guys all frown
So what's our plan
think we should tell Mr
Lang that we couldn't get the money, but that, if he's amenable, we could create a payment calendar-- 90
We're gonna give Jimmy a dummy bag of money, grab Doug, and make a run for it
Yes, good
What an airtight plan--
Jimmy Lang doesn't do payment calendars, Alan
Trust me: this is our only shot of getting Doug back
Left turn
Vick skids onto Highway 12 -- a barely labelled dirt road
Things are quickly going from bad to worse
: streaking across Venice Beach
: ", 6:04AM" -- Tracy exits her bedroom in her jammies, looking like she barely slept
Her father is up, and making breakfast
Any word from Doug
Nope
() know you don't want to hear it, Trace, but you deserve better
Tracy frowns, overwhelmed with stress
'm sure everything's fine
They're all smart, capable adults
: on top of his dirty clothing, fruitlessly trying to create the appearance of a bag full of money
He's using some $20 bills, but also some $5's and $1's
91
This all the cash we got
The guys frown at their empty wallets, yeah
We are ' /
-- The Caddy is parked next to   26 in the middle of the windy desert
The Las Vegas skyline is just barely visible in the distance
Vick very delicately zips up his duffel bag so as not to disturb the bills, and places it on his lap
This is the dumbest plan ever
Alan  need you positive please
Here they come
They all look up to see a   approaching on the far horizon, kicking up a trail of dust
The guys tense up
Stuart
Yeah
There's an emergency bottle of tequila in my glove box
Get it out please
Stu opens the glovebox, pulls out a bottle of Patron
He opens it, takes a swig, then passes it to Vick, who takes a pull and passes it to Alan, who also drinks
They all watch the white Yukon draw ever closer
can't believe this is how we're going to die
The Yukon pulls up about ten yards away
No one moves
The Yukon's doors open
The Cadillac's doors open
the Jimmy Lang's   as it hits the road
92
Vick's  , then Alan's  , then Stu's -, as they all hit the dusty road
The two parties stand by their respective cars, facing off
Somewhere in the desert, a rattlesnake
Let's see the money
Vick gently holds up his duffel bag
Let's see Doug
Jimmy Lang nods to Kalolo, who opens the back door of the Yukon and pulls out a  with his hands tied behind his back and a plastic '  over his head; he struggles a bit
The guys look a bit alarmed
Jesus, what'd they do to him
Pull off the Ralph's bag
Jimmy yanks the bag off of the guy's head to reveal ' It's some black dude
Vick, Stu, and Alan look confused
Who the hell is that
() This is Doug
He pushes the guy forward
Oh my God: it's the other Doug
Roger's friend, the cake designer
(to Jimmy Lang) told you, man, 'm Doug Howland
barely even know these guys
Yeah, you got the wrong Doug, man
93
Jimmy Lang and the thugs look exasperated
You sure
Yeah, man, our Doug is white
But you were partying with this guy at my birthday thing
don't know what to tell you, bro, this isn't the Doug we requested
Well
apologize for the mix-up
(drawing his  ) But 'm still gonna need my money
Vick and the guys start backtracking towards their car
Oh my God Oh my God Oh my God
Don't move, Vick
Vick freezes, duffel in hand, as Stu and Alan slink from view
Jimmy reaches Vick, gun calmly trained at his head
(') Now please
Give me my money
All eyes on Vick, anxiously clutching the bag in his hand
Sweat beads on his brow
(') Don't be stupid, son
You-- Then Vick throws a hard left hook,  Jimmy square in his massive stomach
And Jimmy is built like a tank
Vick freezes, oh shit
Then Jimmy - Vick -- his lip explodes with blood and he falls to the ground
Christ that hurts
94
Then Jimmy picks up the duffel bag
Hefts it
Feels wrong
He goes to open the zipper when he hears: Jimmy looks up to see Stu insanely charging him like the linebacker he once was
Jimmy raises his gun, but The gun flies free and they wrestle for it
Dust flies
The two Guamians fumble for their guns -- but it's difficult with huge  on their shooting hands
He sees what's going down, and, his hands tied behind his back, takes off sprinting towards Vegas
Alan looks around, what should  do
What should  do
Then he spots the keys in the ignition of the car
He hops in and fires up the engine
Just then Bullets pound into the Cadillac
Alan ducks down, terrified, and floors the gas
'm being shot at
'm being shot at
Jimmy Lang throws Stu off of him and recovers his gun, panting
He cocks it, aims it at Stu on the ground
really didn't want to kill anyone -- Then
Alan drives the car into Jimmy Lang at 25mph
The obese mobster is pitched off his feet, and lands a good ten yards away, in a heap of dust
The guys freeze, shocked
95
The Guamians freeze, shocked
Oh my god, is he okay
Who cares
Go go
Alan floors the car while Stu and Vick  and  in
The caddy peels the hell out of there, kicking up rocks and dust
The Guamians  after them
taking out the tail-lights, the windshield, the headrests
The guys duck down til they're sufficiently far away
Then they sit up, amazed, out of breath
can't believe you just saved my life
can't believe you just drove my car into Jimmy Lang
Alan drives, his eyes as big as saucers
He's gonna be really upset
Yeah,  was just thinking that
The huge mobster lies face-down on the desert floor
His two henchmen waddle up, highly concerned
Boss, Boss, you okay
Jimmy sputters into the dirt, furious
Find Vick
And kill him
'  -- The guys race down the dusty highway in traumatized silence
Now can we call Tracy
96
Vick frowns and blots his split lip with his sleeve
Yeah
It's probably time
: --   -- The guys pull up at a lone, dusty payphone in the middle of the desert
They all look at the phone
Who wants to make the call
Beat
Then Vick reaches for his nose, odd man out
Stu and Alan immediately reach for their noses, too
It's close
That was you
What
No
beat you by a mile
Vick, who won
() Actually
should do it
This weekend was mostly my fault
need to Man Up
Alan looks shocked -- and impressed -- by Vick's newfound sense of responsibility
Well, 'll be damned
Vick grabs the bottle of Patron, takes a long swig
Beat
still can't believe Stu banged my sister
Vick hands the bottle to Alan, gets out, and makes for the pay phone
: --   -- Tracy is putting on her makeup in the bridal suite
Her stern dad blows in
97
Any word from Doug
The way he spits out "Doug" tells us all we need to know about how Mr
Turner feels about his future son-in-law
No, but 'm sure he's-- Just then, Tracy's   rings
She quickly answers it
(') Hello
: In the desert, on the pay phone, looking through his busted aviators into the rising sun
Tracy, it's Vick
Hey Vick
Listen, honey
The bachelor party got a little out of control and, well
we lost Doug
(her jaw dropping) What
But we're getting married in like four hours
Yeah, that's not gonna happen
Alan starts to take a pull of Patron -- when he freezes, realizing something
on the phone with Tracy, being genuinely contrite
Look, 'm really sorry, Trace
This is all my fault-- 98
Suddenly, Alan flies out of nowhere and snatches the receiver out of Vick's hand
(') What the--
Alan gets on the phone with Tracy, his heart racing
Tracy, it's Alan
Hey, Vick is just joking around
We've got Doug right here
Vick looks like: what
() What kind of joke is that
know, Vick is such a prick
We'll see you at the wedding
Bye
Alan hangs up and races back to the car
Vick follows
What are you doing
know where Doug is
: -- Tracy stands in her bridal suite
Then she just Her father hurries over, concerned
: -- Alan floors the car back onto the 15 towards Vegas, amped
Remember when we saw Doug's bed impaled on the griffin thing
Yeah, we threw it out the window
No: the windows don't open, remember
99
So how did--
() Oh my God
don't get it
And that's why we've been seeing Doug's clothes all over Vegas
He was trying to signal someone
don't believe it
- still don't get it-- And it totally jives with the timeline, right
We brought Doug back to the hotel at 5:00, he was passed out
It's so obvious
Not
to me
so much
How'd you figure it out
The Patron, man
It reminded me of our first drink of the night
Honestly, dude, you're a genius
He's on the roof
Stu looks confused, the roof
100
After Doug passed out, we must've taken him up there in his bed as a prank, so he'd wake up on the roof or whatever
Then we forgot him
And all day he's been throwing his crap off the roof, trying to signal someone to get him down
You think he's still up there
Only one way to find out
: -- The guys peel up to the valet and sprint out of the car
--  -- The guys race through the lobby at top speed
--  -- The guys burst out of the steel door, onto the massive black tar roof
It's empty
,
But Doug is nowhere to be seen
The guys start to despair
Then
stepping out from behind an air-conditioning vent, naked except for tighty-whities, his entire body bright pink from sunburn
And he looks furious
The guys run to him, overjoyed
Oh my god, 'm so glad you're okay
101
Before they can hug him, though, Doug holds up his hand, and whispers, nasty, parched: Don't
even
talk to me
The guys stop short
Okay, no, that's cool
Yeah, you have every right to be upset
We validate your anger
: : ", 7:05AM" /
'  -- The guys gingerly rush Doug, now in a Mandalay Bay bathrobe and clutching an arm-full of  , through the hotel lobby
Alan is arguing into his cellphone
As they pass  at his desk, Vick yells over: Why'd you do it, sweet Atashir
Why did you betray us
Because they paid me
And also because you're kind of racist
Fair enough
See you next time, you beautiful Judas
They blow out of the hotel
--  -- where their beatup Caddy is waiting
Alan slams his cellphone shut, frowning
No flights to  with empty seats
Well, we can't drive
It's 350 miles to  and the wedding starts at 10, which is in-- () 102
(') (looking at watch) --three hours
Beat
Then Vick, Stu and Alan exchange a look
a smile slowly creeps across their faces
: -15 Vick is at the wheel, leaning on the , keeping the three- doored Caddy at 110 miles per hour
When traffic gets thick, he doesn't hesitate to drive in the shoulder
In the backseat, Doug chugs bottled water, still simmering
Look, Doug,  think  speak for everyone in the car when  say 'm really sorry about locking you on the roof of the hotel
You gotta admit, it's a pretty funny prank
mean, up until the part when we forgot all about you
Doug just stares out at the desert in stony silence
(') He's still not talking to us
Totally understandable, man
Whenever you're ready
: : ", 9:15AM" -- Workers bustle about the grand lawn of the Bel Air Bay Club, putting the last touches on the outdoor wedding site
It's beautiful: the royal palms, the expansive views of the Pacific, the white chairs in perfect rows, the altar adorned in roses
begins to warm up as well-heeled filter in, finding their seats
103
--   -- Tracy checks her watch as a  works on her hair
Then she checks her watch again
: : ", 9:47AM" 10 -- '   speeds up alongside the Caddy as they fly down the 10 freeway
very nervous  opens the van's sliding door and, wind whipping his face, throws a huge over to Alan, who stands and catches it
Vick nods at the van driver and shouts over the wind: ,
The driver gives Vick a thumbs up, and heads off
Alan rips open the package -- inside are four
The guys start taking off their tattered clothes
: -- All the seats at the wedding are filled
Everyone is there
Except the Groomsmen
Or the Groom
The harpist still plays, though she's starting to look a little pissed
-- Looking beautiful in her wedding gown, Tracy gazes out of the window at the perfect wedding arranged below
Then she notices guests whispering, is something wrong
Where's the groom
She turns away, trying to hold it together
: : ", 10:03AM" ' /
10  -- The guys,   now in their tuxes, rocket down the freeway, primping
Alan brushes his teeth, Doug tries to comb his hair, Stu   flosses, and Vick shaves with an electric razor as he weaves   in and out of traffic
: 104
: ", 10:19AM" -- Tracy paces in the bridal suite
Then Mr
Turner enters
'm sorry, honey, but  think you need to seriously consider that Doug might not be coming
Tracy stops short, speechless
(') Some men just aren't cut out for this kind of commitment
'm so sorry that this is how you had to find out-- Just then, we hear a car   outside
The Bridesmaids sit around the posh lobby, waiting, anxious
Just then, the doors blow open and , , , stride inside
Their tuxes are wrinkled, their hair is a mess, and the groom is bright pink -- but they're here
Sorry, Mapquest took us a crazy route
We ready to do this thing
The bridesmaids sit up, stunned
: walking down the aisle, arm-in-arm, as Mozart plays
Tracy looks tentative
Her father frowns, not at all happy
Everyone smiles, , and snaps photos
The groomsmen smile as well
Vick whispers to Doug: She looks beautiful, man
105
Doug still doesn't speak to him
(') That's cool
get it
reaches the altar, then turns to her dad
His face is a mess of emotions
They hug
love you, Daddy
love you too, pumpkin
Tracy's Dad shoots Doug a nasty look before taking his seat in the first row
Then Tracy approaches Doug at the altar, and whispers to him, angry, hurt: Where were you
And why are you pink
It's a long story
All  can say is 'm so sorry
And  promise, for as long as we're married,  will never ever put you through something like this again
(desperate, pleading) Can
Can you forgive me
Tracy studies his face, searching
All the guests wait with bated breath
The groomsmen wince, come on come on come on
Then, unable to be mad at Doug, Tracy smiles and kisses him
He kisses her back
The guests all  in relief
The groomsmen exhale, whew
Vick and Alan covertly knock fists
The Minister clears his throat
We, um, we traditionally wait til the end for the kiss
But Doug and Tracy just keep on kissing
: 106
at the reception
The entire wedding party is applauding
and the   kicks in
We are now down on the lawn, where white tables and a dance floor have been set up
Vick, Stu, and Alan aggressively  and  for the bride and the groom
We did it, fellahs
We pulled it off
never had a doubt
They
Alan smiles, more relaxed than we've ever seen him
They sip champagne and watch Doug and Tracy enjoy their first dance on the dance floor
You think Doug's ever going to talk to us again
Give him time
Yeah
Like a decade or two-- Then Stu sees someone approaching over Alan's shoulder
Uh-oh
The guys all look over to see Alan's girlfriend of 14 years, bearing down on them, irate
Hey Beck--
Shut up, Vick
Alan, where the hell have you been
've been calling and calling
What, you don't answer your phone anymore
107
Alan shrinks down, back to being the chastised boyfriend
-'m so sorry,  can explain-- Then there's a '  behind them
' Alan
They all turn to see standing behind them in a very sexy, very elegant dress, her hair back
She cleans up nicely
Alan swallows, whoa
This just got complicated
Jennifer
Chastity smiles that he called her by her real name
- know  wasn't invited, but just had to return this
She hands Alan his '
Becky watches on, stunned
Okay: who the hell is this chick, and why the hell does she have your Grandmother's wedding ring
Alan looks back and forth between Becky and Chastity
It's the moment of truth
The fork in life's road
(') Talk, you moron
Jesus, you're just like your mother
Talk
Who's the ho wearing my ring
And in that moment, it all becomes so clear
Alan turns: She's my wife
Becky's jaw drops
Chastity smiles slightly
Stu and Vick grin, oh shit
108
(') We don't make each other happy anymore, Beck
And we can keep not making each other happy for another 14 years -- hell, maybe even another 50 years -- but let's not
Let's find people who make our hearts race
Let's be excited and fun and alive again
Alan looks at Becky, sincere, honest
Beat
Are you fucking kidding me
Alan shakes his head, sadly, no
'm sorry, Beck
really am
(to Chastity) Can  buy you a free drink
Chastity smiles, takes his arm, and they walk off together towards the bar
We're not
actually
still married, are we
Let's start with dinner, and see where it goes
(smiling warmly) 'd like that
She finally recovers enough to speak: Alan
Alan Steven Mervish, get back here this second
(but Alan keeps walking) Don't you walk away from me, you stupid little clown
own you But Alan just keeps walking away with Chastity
Vick and Stu wave him on, go dude
Go
Then Becky turns on them
Beat
They both scatter, terrified
109
as he hurries off through the crowd
After a moment, he : Daddy
Stu turns to see his    in sundresses racing through the crowd towards him
They leap into his arms, so excited to see him
He scoops them both up
Oh,  missed you guys so much
We missed you too, daddy
You're the best dad ever
Beat
And then Stu just starts
Tears everywhere
His lovely wife  appears, harried, a diaper bag over her shoulder, and sees him crying
She rolls her eyes
Jesus, are you still drunk
Stu shakes his head, no, and keeps  as he pulls her into a big family hug
-- '  -- Vick, a cocktail in hand, his tie undone, heads into the men's room and approaches a urinal
Then  and walk in behind him, still in their huge arm casts, still very pissed
Vick inhales, scared
Okay, okay, 'll go with you
Just
don't ruin the wedding
Then   enters the bathroom on
really didn't want it to end like this, Vick
Vick nods, resigned, and starts towards him
Then Jimmy extends his hand for Vick to shake
110
(') Good luck
(totally thrown) Um, what
Your friend Alan just paid your marker
Took out a second mortgage on his house
The full 200 grand, plus medical expenses, which thought was a classy touch
Vick looks blown away
(') Without our friends, we are nothing, Vick
Remember that
The three injured mobsters exit
Vick remains standing there, overwhelmed, his life literally saved
: , , standing on the cliffs overlooking the Pacific, drinks in hand, as the wedding reception rages on behind them
will pay you back, you know
Damn straight you will
They all
Okay, so what the hell happened this weekend
The guys turn to see Doug approaching, smiling
They grin as he falls in with them, looking out at the calm blue ocean
Well, Alan married a stripper, Stu went gay, and  learned a very important life lesson from an obese hoodlum
We'll tell you the whole story when you get back from your honeymoon
111
We really are sorry, man
Doug nods,  know
Vick raises his cocktail
To Doug and Tracy
To Doug and Tracy
To Doug and Tracy
To me and Tracy -- and to being here, with my three former best friends in the world
The guys
(') There's nowhere else 'd rather be right now
They nod, heartfelt, hear-hear
(') That said, let's not get too stupid tonight, okay
'm going on my honeymoon in 24 hours
The guys all nod reassuringly
No, no
/ We'll be good
/ Totally, dude
