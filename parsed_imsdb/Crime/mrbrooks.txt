Written by Bruce  Evans & Raynold Gideon : on a Polaroid of a dimly lit  locked in a sexual embrace
We cannot see their faces
(
) (tortured) God grant me the Serenity to accept the things  cannot change
Our view travels sensuously down the Woman's naked torso to find the Man's head buried between her legs
(
) Why do you fight it so hard, Earl
(
) Courage to change the things can
(
) Come on, you've been a good boy for a long time, you deserve a little fun
Our view moves back up to the Woman's breasts
: ' reflection in a mirror
Earl, in his 40's, has on a tuxedo
He's in front of a sink in a Public Bathroom and he's whispering to his image
and Wisdom to know the difference
Picking up speed against the hunger in his head: (') Living one day at a time, Enjoying one moment at a time, Accepting hardship as a pathway to peace
From far away comes the sound of applause
- in tuxedos and  in gowns
Mr
Brooks is seated at one of the front tables with his wife, , also 40's
() 2
: The audience's hands are coming together for what a  at the microphone has just said
Mr
Brooks is smiling but not clapping; and although his lips don't move we can hear: (
) (even faster now) Taking, as He did, this sinful world as it is, not as  would have it
Trusting that He will make all things right if  surrender to His will
That  may be reasonably happy in this life, And supremely happy with Him forever in the next
Amen
The Man at the microphone raises his arms to quiet the Audience
could go on and on about what a great guy Earl is, how he cuts his toe nails
Everyone laughs
how he gives freely of his time and money, but let's get Earl up here to speak for himself
Ladies and Gentlemen,  give you a businessman, a philanthropist, a great friend and the Evanston Chamber of Commerce Man of the Year
Mr
Earl Brooks
Mr
Brooks kisses Emma, stands and after accepting congratulations along the way, arrives at the podium
Thank you all very much
The first thing  would like to say is don't even know how  cut my toe nails
Applause and laughter from the Audience
Twenty years ago when  started the Brooks Box Factory  never dreamed would one day be standing here
3
- silver Lexus  430 glides past us
(
) Did you see Sis Wallace's dress
Mr
Brooks is driving
Emma is in the passenger seat
They're holding hands
You could see her nipples
At her age she should keep those things hidden
Mr
Brooks is only listening to his Wife with one ear and underneath what she is saying we can barely hear: (
) God grant me the Serenity to accept
The only thing that would have made this evening more perfect is if Jane had been here
She called
She has mid terms coming up
She's dropping out, you know
We'll see
Nothing she does is wrong to you, is it
Mr
Brooks doesn't rise to the bait
Well she missed a good party
As she continues, we look at Mr
Brooks and Emma's voice fades to a murmur
() 4
: In the back seat, a Man leans out from behind Mr
Brooks's head
This is
He's 50 plus
Emma can neither see nor hear him
Marshall exists only in Mr
Brooks's mind
Come on, Earl, give yourself a break, you know you want to do this
No
You're the fucking 'man of the year', you deserve it
It's not like it's not set up
You already know how to by-pass the alarm, you know how to pick the locks
Tonight's the perfect night
(over his shoulder) No, Marshall,  said 'no'
heard you, Earl, but you don't mean 'no'
Emma feels Mr
Brooks's distance
What's the matter
Mr
Brooks pulls himself back into the moment
Nothing
You were frowning
was thinking of what  didn't say in the speech
They laughed, they were touched, don't think anyone felt left out
() 5
: (2) (from the back seat) They have their dance class tonight
What if we go by and just look at them
There's no harm in just having a look
No means 'no', Marshall
Please
pretty please
(to Emma) The food tonight was very good, but wasn't crazy about the dessert
Would you like to stop somewhere and get something sweet
In a booth, Mr
Brooks and Emma are sharing a Sundae
Mr
Brooks steals a look at the Arthur Murray dance class that is taking place behind the full-length windows fronting the second floor of the Building across the street
Labradors are supposed to be nice, or maybe a rescue mutt
The Pound's a pretty sad place; if you want me to, 'll go with you
There's an Irish Lab  read about, and  think the breeder is
Mr
Brooks turns his attention back to the Dancers and again Emma's voice fades to a murmur
Both Mr
Brooks and Marshall who is seated on the other side of Emma are focused on one particular
The Man and Woman are not great dancers nor are they especially attractive, but Mr
Brooks and Marshall are fascinated with them
Marshall leans forward and looking slyly around Emma at Mr
Brooks: () 6
: bet your dick's getting hard, isn't it, just imagining what they would look like dead
Savoring the ice-cream, Mr
Brooks nods
Two story modern
Not ostentatious, but the elegance of the line and the grounds say there's big money here
- Through the door of the  , Emma can be seen taking off her evening clothes
Hidden by the darkness on the other side of the bed, Mr
Brooks is hunched forward on a chair, his head in his hands
His bow tie is undone, but he's still wearing his Tuxedo
In obvious torment, he is whispering to himself
can't do this,  can't do this,  can't do this, please don't let me do this, God grant me the Serenity to accept the things cannot change
In the Emma is putting on her sleep-wear
Mr
Brooks steps into the doorway
'm going to stay up a while, maybe go to the studio and play with some glazes
Okay, 'm going to read
If 'm not awake, wake me when you come back
Mr
Brooks comes forward, puts his arms around Emma and hugs her, then easing back, kisses her
thought you were wonderful tonight
7
Mr
Brooks exits the back door and starts down a path that leads away from the house
(to himself) Don't do this, don't do this, please don't do this, don't do this, don't do, please don't do this
He passes through a screen of trees and arrives at a small beautiful industrial-looking Building
No windows except for a narrow strip on three sides just under the edge of the roof
Mr
Brooks lets himself in with a key
Exquisitely unique handmade handglazed bowls, vases, cups, plates are scattered haphazardly on shelves and tables around the room
This is Mr
Brooks's
Mr
Brooks turns on the big industrial kiln and sets the temperature, then in a series of quick cuts changes out of his tuxedo into his work clothes which he selects from a dozen identical pairs of khaki shirts and pants hanging in a closet
Below the pants and shirts are a dozen pairs of identical leather work shoes
The windbreaker he puts on is also from a dozen identical windbreakers
He takes a set of car keys off a hook next to a door which opens into a garage
Under the light is an older model non- descript Toyota
The Toyota backs into an alley and with the garage door closing behind it, pulls away
Marshall is up front with Mr
Brooks
() 8
: Oh Lordy, Earl my boy, 've missed this
We are going to have so much fun
This is the last time, Marshall
Understand me
The very last time
mixture of modest houses and apartment buildings
Mr
Brooks's Toyota is parked in the semi-dark cast by a tree
We rise over the car, over the trees, over the houses to the other side of the block and come down to find Mr
Brooks working the lock on the side door of a small
He has on surgical gloves
The pick is extracted, the handle turned
The door opens
There's a chain
Mr
Brooks removes a pair of bent rubber tipped forceps from a pocket, inserts it in the chain, pulls the door to, gives the tool a twist and gently pushes the door inward
The chain has been released
Mr
Brooks quietly closes the door and holding his breath stands very still and listens
There's a faint indistinct sound coming from the recesses of the house
Mr
Brooks's feet glide out of the
Now coming slightly behind him is another pair of legs encased in dark slacks
Move up; the person in the black slacks is Marshall
In the middle of the , the sound is now recognizable
It's the moans of a Couple fucking
This disturbs Mr
Brooks, he hesitates
Marshall leans in and hisses fiercely in his ear
() 9
: Don't you dare quit on me, you piece of shit
want to see what they're doing
Mr
Brooks's spine stiffens and he's going forward again
Entering a , he reaches into his jacket
When his hand reappears it's inside a Ziplock bag, his fingers around the butt of a silenced pistol
He brings the hand and bag to his mouth and tightens the Ziplock against his wrist
The two Men arrive at a door that's slightly ajar
Behind it the sounds of the love-making are becoming more intense
Mr
Brooks nudges the door with his foot
It opens enough for he and Marshall to see the Couple inside
The Man and Woman from the Arthur Murray dance class are naked on the bed
As much as Mr
Brooks hates himself for it he loves watching
He can now hear his heart beating in his ears
He begins to breathe in unison with the Couple, but his expression is distant almost clinical
When the Couple climaxes, when they come, Mr
Brooks's face goes blank
On the bed the Woman rolls off her Partner and the two of them lie there basking in the afterglow
Behind them Mr
Brooks pushes the door fully open and slips into the
They don't know he's there until he speaks
Hello
Both the Man and Woman jump with surprise and look
The Woman screams and scrabbles at the sheet to cover herself
What the fuck
Then he sees the gun
Hey, man, don't
() 10
: (2) (to the Woman) Be quiet and sit up
In an attempt to get away, the Woman pushes herself back against the wall
She can't take her eyes off Mr
Brooks and she can't stop screaming
hole appears above her left eye
The impact of Mr
Brooks's High Velocity
22 slug bounces her head off the wall
The screaming stops
The Man opens his mouth and begins to shake
The bullet through his brain makes him instantly dead and he crumples onto the Girl
Mr
Brooks looks at what he's done
His nostrils flare at the scent of death
Then he moves, he's got work to do
On his way to the bed, the pistol goes into his pocket
(
) (barks) Whoa, Earl, what the fuck is this
Mr
Brooks snaps a look
The curtains of the bedroom window are open; and over half of the Apartments in a four story Building on the other side of an alley can see into this room
Most of their windows are dark
And there's no one looking out of the windows that are lit
These pigs liked to fuck with the blinds open, you should have known that, Earl
This is a big mistake for you, Earl
(going to the window) Almost like  want to get caught, huh, Marshall
Well, don't fucking do that don't think either of us would enjoy spending the rest of our lives in jail or a lethal injection
() 11
: (3) Yes, sir
He grabs a side of cloth in either hand and yanks the curtains closed
: on a Polaroid of the dance Couple in a sexual pose
The attitude of the bodies is awkward and very reminiscent of the ones in the Polaroid we opened the movie with
Mr
Brooks is kneeling naked in front of the kiln where his murder clothes are being reduced to ash
Arranged on the floor are Polaroids of the dance Couple in sexual positions
Please forgive me
Please forgive me
As we look closer at the Photographs we realize by a smear of blood here and there and the distortion of the limbs that these tableaus were arranged after the Couple was killed
One by one, Mr
Brooks picks up his souvenirs
He lingers over the last image; and from where he's sitting on the edge of a table: Don't even think about it
You know the rules
Reluctantly Mr
Brooks throws the Polaroids into the fire of the kiln
Now go up and make love to your beautiful wife
He leaves
In the kiln, the Polaroids burst into flame
The sunlight exposes its charm
If it weren't for the Police tape, the  , and the  , it looks like it would be a cool place to live
() 12
: An  , an African-American, comes out on the porch and calls to two other  who are drinking coffee on the lawn: Where the fuck is Atwood
called ten minutes ago, they said she was on her way
She doesn't get here soon, these bodies won't even be dead anymore
Uniformed Cop standing guard at the tape: You looking for the lady Cop
Yeah
She's here
She's been sitting in her car right over there for the last half hour
Oh, Christ
' Special Detective  , somewhere in her 30's, is behind the wheel
The door is open
By the expression on her face we might guess that Detective Atwood has simply forgotten to get out of the car
On the seat next to her is a copy of the Chicago Tribune
The headline of a middle article on the first page reads: Move up to Atwood's face
The Older Detective followed by the Younger Detective approaches
You thinking of joining us anytime soon, Atwood
Atwood doesn't look at the Detectives for a long beat and when she does her expression is not friendly
() 13
: really hated yesterday, Snyder, and then today came along
As she gets out of the car, the Men notice the bandages on her wrists and falling into step with her on the way to the house
( ) What happened to your wrists
Atwood holds up her hands to reveal the extent of the bandages
tried to commit suicide
The Young Detective laughs
Atwood whirls on him
What's so funny
Eh
don't know,  heard it was because you were drunk and got into a fight with a fish tank
Atwood sticks her finger into the Young Detective's chest
Who are you gonna believe
Me or the fucking fish
Eh
you
Good
Atwood turns and leaves the Men
(under his breath) She's nuts
And rich
They catch up to Atwood who has squatted down to examine the lock on the front door
() 14
: (2) There are some scratches in the side door cylinder
Other than that no signs of forced entry
The alarm was armed and we even had to cut the security chains to get in
(straightens up) This guy hasn't been active for over two years
She enters the house
From the way Atwood looks at her surroundings as she crosses the Living Room we get the feel that this Woman misses nothing
we think he's either dead or in jail on some other charge
This is probably a copycat
Detective Snyder points her down the Hall toward the Bedroom and follows
That's why we called you
You're the God that tells us peons if we have a simple murder here or something we can dump on you
Bite yourself
Atwood arrives in the doorway of the  where the murders took place and stops
The Bodies of the dance Couple are now on the floor
The Man is propped up against the bed in a sitting position
The Woman has her head in the Man's crotch
Almost like Mr
Brooks, Atwood's nostrils flare, but in Atwood's case it's not the scent of death that arouses her but it's like she's searching for the scent of her prey
In a glance she memorizes the Room, then steps inside
15
The Crime Scene  shift to accommodate Atwood's inspection
(indicating the Victims) He always rearranges the bodies, but this is out of character
He has never left them in such a crude position
Usually it's more romantic with their arms around each other, kissing, their mouths open, their tongues touching
So we have a copycat
Where are the thumbprints
Snyder points to a bare space of wall above the bed
Atwood leans in to look at two bloody 'thumbprints' placed side by side
One his one hers
That's what it looks like
What's that
There are two holes gouged into the plaster of the wall
The bullets went completely through the victims
The killer recovered the slugs
Atwood unfolds and after another look around the room goes to the window and cracks the curtains
There's the four story Apartment Building across the alley, its windows staring down at her
Were these open or closed when you got here
() 16
: Closed
Atwood tries the cord, the curtains are stuck
Hmm
She returns her attention to the murder scene
It has never been revealed to the public that the Thumbprint Killer retrieves the slugs
So this one's yours
don't fucking need this
She doubles back and cracks the curtains for another look at the four story Apartment Building
Have you checked the tenants of that building
Only a few of them are home, they say they didn't see anything
We checked the whole neighborhood, so far nobody saw a thing
Atwood nods and turns back to the bodies
Leaving them like this, he must have been angry at them for some reason
She reaches down and runs a hand over the carpet
Where would they keep their vacuum cleaner
puzzled Snyder follows her out of the room
Atwood opens a service closet
There's the Vacuum Cleaner
() 17
: 'll bet you a hundred bucks, Snyder, there is no bag in that vacuum cleaner
have no idea what you're looking for
Atwood unzips the cover
There is no bag inside
He vacuumed the house and took the bag
Oh, shit
That is scary smart
Detective Atwood is standing on an empty capped plastic gallon milk carton looking over the fence into the back yard of the Murder House
Snyder has his hand on her back to steady her
Okay
He releases her
She hops down and directs her attention at the four story Apartment Building
Our best hope is if someone in there saw something
comes out from behind the next door fence and strides purposefully toward them
Detective Tracy Atwood
Yes
This is for you
She accepts the official looking document being offered
You have been served
() 18
: You fucking asshole
'm in the middle of a fucking murder investigation
(backing away) Hey, take it easy lady, 'm just the messenger
Goddamit
What is it
My soon to be ex-husband's scumbag lawyer is trying to show me how painful she can make my life if don't give them what they want
This is not the Doctor
The doctor was a couple years ago
This one is my stupid mistake
An  Meeting is getting started
Mr
Brooks is one of the The  steps into the semicircle of Men and Women
Are there any new members
comes forward
Hi, my name is Vaughn and 'm an alcoholic
She rejoins the circle
Mr
Brooks separates himself from the Others
Hi, my name is Earl and 'm an addict
When he rejoins the circle, Marshall is there to greet him
() 19
: You're such a fucking hypocrite
If you were honest you would step out there and say 'Hi, 'm Earl killed two people last night and really got off on it, but  need your help to be cured
' 'm different Marshall,  won't argue that with you
This is the only place that has ever helped me be normal and 've been straight up until last night for the past two years
'm not going to kill again and 'm not going to quit coming here because it upsets you
Yeah but for the next 29 days you're going to have to step out there and say 'Hi, 'm Earl, 'm an addict
' And everybody will know you fell off the wagon
Don't you feel stupid doing that
No
feel good
Cab arrives at the Front Entrance of the , a long three story brick Building
, 19, is dropped off along with an assortment of luggage and boxes
It's loud
We follow a thin piece of cardboard as one machine deals it off the bottom of a stack into the maw of another machine
That machine prints one side of the cardboard blue
It is handed off to the third machine which cuts the flaps
The fourth machine folds and glues those flaps and spits the piece of cardboard out onto a conveyor belt as a box
Wearing safety glasses and ear protectors along with his business suit, Mr
Brooks picks up the box and hands it to one of three similarly attired , standing nearby
() 20
: This is not the top of the line or the bottom, but for the money we're talking about this is the quality can provide you
As Mr
Brooks talks the Men pass the box between them
Your packaging is the first impression your customers will have of your product
Mr
Brooks, your daughter is waiting for you in your office
surprised Mr
Brooks grabs a quick look at the  Speaker, then continues
We'd love to work you with on the design
It's fun to challenge our machines
If you check around, you'll find we're not the cheapest, but we are the best
- On his way through to his office, Mr
Brooks smiles absently at a  waiting on the couch
The pleasant-looking Man in his early 30's, nods
Mr
Brooks stops at his 's desk
Sunday, did Jane call and say she was coming
would have given you that message, Mr
Brooks
She has boxes and suitcases downstairs
Hold my calls
' (coming in) What are you doing here, Gorgeous
() 21
: The 19 year old Girl we saw arrive by cab stands up and throws her arms around Mr
Brooks
'm sorry, Daddy, please don't be angry with me
Mr
Brooks kisses Jane on the forehead and goes to sit at his desk
can guess what you've done, but why don't you tell me and then 'll decide
dropped out of school
Okay
Have you told your mother this
No
wanted to speak to you first
You'll have to tell her, 'm not going to do that for you, and then together the three of us will decide where to go from here
've thought a lot about this, Dad
College is a waste of time for me
don't know how you know that half way through your Freshman year, but
You didn't go to college, Dad, and you're successful
want to come and work for you
Sitting on the couch: She's not telling you everything, she's hiding something
() 22
: (2) know
(to Jane) 'm not hiring right now
Just listen to me
What would happen to the business if, God forbid, something happened to you
Mom would probably have to sell to strangers
'm willing to start at the bottom, you can treat me as a regular employee,  want to learn everything there is to know about running the box business, and then when the time comes, the business would stay in the family
That's sweet, but you're talking about emotion, not business
In fact your mother and  came very close to selling out last year
What
If we had been offered a little more money, and they may come back to us, we will sell
What would you do without
There's a knock on the door
Yes
Sunday, the secretary, comes in and crossing to Mr
Brooks: 'm sorry,  know you didn't want to be disturbed, the Man in the waiting room insisted  give you this
She hands Mr
Brooks a letter-size envelope
() 23
: (3) He said you would find what's inside very interesting
What is he
salesman
He won't say
've never seen him before
can tell him to go away if you want me to
That's okay
She leaves
Slicing the flap of the envelope, Mr
Brooks picks up with Jane
Part of spending the four years in college is to
Mr
Brooks can now see the contents of the envelope
Two snapshot-size  taken with a high speed digital camera
One shows the right side of Mr
Brooks's cheek
He is in no way identifiable, but that blur of flesh appears to be looking at the dead dance Couple
The second Photo is a clear shot of Mr
Brooks closing the curtains with the dead dance Couple behind him
Neither Mr
Brooks's voice or his face betray the enormity of what he's looking at
eh
to give yourself the chance to find out who you are and what you want to do
'll talk to Mom, but 'm not going back to school
Where would you live
To save money  would move back home, but no rules, no curfew, want to be treated like an adult
() 24
: (4) Mr
Brooks allows himself a slight smile
Would you pay for your food, would you pay rent
No, dad, you're a very wealthy man, you can afford to keep me
Mr
Brooks presses his Intercom
Sunday, would you show the gentleman who gave you the envelope to the conference room, and tell him 'll meet him there and
(to Jane) What happened to the
friend is driving it across country, it'll be here next weekend
(to Sunday, through Intercom) And get Jane a cab
He picks up the phone and holds it out to Jane
Call your mother
Are you going to give me a job
If it were up to me, and  think your mother will agree with this, you should go back to school
- Mr
Brooks comes around the corner
He's raving at Marshall who's walking beside him
You see all of this
The factory, the houses, the cars, the money, the respect
() 25
: different angle in the same hallway shows Mr
Brooks walking away from us
passing  crosses him
The Men nod to each other
Marshall is nowhere in sight
(
) like them
don't want to lose them
And then we're back to the original angle and Marshall is again in the picture
That's why  didn't want to do the dance Couple
Stop your fucking whining, Earl, you enjoyed doing that Couple just as much as  did, and look on the bright side, he came to us he didn't go to the Cops
If he tries to shake us down we kill him
Period
We make it fun but we kill him
End of story
- The Man from the Reception Area is nervously admiring a display of Mr
Brooks's ceramic pieces
He turns at the sound of the door opening behind
What can  do for you, Mr
Let's say, 'Smith'
Okay, Mr
Smith
Mr
Brooks motions him to a seat
() (sitting) Before you get the wrong impression, Mr
Brooks, 'm not here to shake you down
() 26
: (holding up the photos) Then these are the only copies of these photos and you have no others
No
have other copies and other photos, and if something were to happen to me
How did you find me, Mr
Smith
You're 'Man of the Year', Mr
Brooks
Your picture was in the paper
If it hadn't been,  don't know what  would have done
Lucky me
What is it that  can help you with
've been watching that Couple for months, they liked to make love with the blinds open
Sometimes would take pictures, you know, visual aides for later
It was fun, it was a great way to get off; thought, until  saw you kill them
have to tell you  have never ever felt a rush like that ever know you're the Thumbprint killer, you've done this before
What want is to go with you the next time you kill someone
And  would like that to be soon
From the end of the table, Marshall cackles a laugh
And you were worried that this was going to be unpleasant
The answer is simple
Just tell him you've decided never to kill again and he'll go away
You enjoy watching me suffer, don't you
() 27
: (2) In a word, yes
Where do you think he has the other pictures
He put them in a safety deposit box but 'll bet the box is at the bank where he has his checking account and the key is on his keychain
He really wants to do this, he's not going to go to the cops
Mr
Smith who has grown uneasy under Mr
Brooks's stare swallows: So do we have a deal
From the angle of these pictures
(taps the envelope) you live on the third floor of the apartment building across the alley from the Couple's house
Well
eh
Yes or no, Mr
Smith
Mr
Smith nods 'yes'
What time do you get home from work
Six thirty, seven, depending on the traffic
You can never come here again, you can never call me
Do you understand that
Yes
() 28
: (3) Tomorrow night, not tonight, tomorrow night, at eight o'clock, leave your apartment and walk east
'll pick you up
If you're thinking of doing anything to me, Mr
Brooks
We're both aware of the rules, Mr
Smith, but  feel  must warn you
If it turns out that you enjoy killing, it can become very addictive
It could ruin your life
want to do this
(looks at Marshall) Have  covered everything
can't think of anything else
Mr
Brooks stands up and opens the door
'll see you tomorrow night, Mr
Smith
On his way out, Mr
Smith nods
Mr
Brooks closes the door
His chin drops on his chest and he sighs
(under his breath) Please God, please help me find a way not to do this
Detective Atwood comes out of the  on the sidewalk and enters a Highrise
- Atwood and her , a gray-haired Man in his 60's, and an Asian Woman about the same age as Atwood are on one side of the table
() 29
: , Atwood's soon to be ex-husband, very handsome, slightly younger than Atwood, and , his attractive divorce lawyer, sit across from them
We've talked to our client and we've come up with a number that we feel is more than fair
Atwood is not happy with this
The Attorney slides a sheet of paper to Sheila
She turns it over
On it is written: $750,000 -
We can have a check for that amount in your office by 6 o'clock
We told you at the beginning what we want and that hasn't changed
- You know as well as  do, Counselor, if we go to court you're not going to get a million five
don't know
Let's see
She holds up the front page of the Chicago Tribune
" " story is circled in red
This is the front page of yesterday's paper
(reads) 'Hangman Escapes'
eh
now, here it is
'after torturing the young women, Thorton Meeks would hang them in public places - church steeples, balconies, Freeway overpasses'
Your client captured Mr
Meeks
This is just one example of the cases my client lived through when he was married to your client
Your client knew Detective Atwood was a homicide detective when he married her
() 30
: (2) But he had no idea of the mental anguish that being in close proximity to her work would cause him
What about the mental anguish went through being in close proximity to him
Who's gonna pay me for that
We don't need to get into this, Tracy
Yes, we do
was the one who paid for everything while we were married, and now 'm being asked to give him a bonus for spending time with me when 've already paid for it in the first place
(to Atwood) Tracy, this is not a lot of money for you, and you know how upset was when Meeks said that he was going to escape and he would come back and kill you
We're quite willing to find out what a court would think that mental anguish is worth
Jesse
Darling
you know the best thing that could happen to me right now
That you get hit by a truck and die
(smiles) That's it
Mr
Vialo and  are leaving
(she and Jesse stand up) You've threatened my client, we're going to ask for a restraining order, and we'll see you in court
() 31
: (3) The door closes behind them
- That's going to cost you, Tracy
(standing up) Fuck it
It felt good
Moonlight seeps around the blinds to reveal Mr
Smith asleep in bed
Beyond the open  door down the hall is only darkness until the eruption of illumination from a penlight momentarily outlines the figure of a Man
Then we're looking at what the penlight sees
keyring
Hands in surgical gloves isolate the - safety deposit key - and press it into a soft wax block where it leaves its impression
The light goes off
In the  at the end of the hallway, Mr
Smith begins to snore
The Figure coasts silently toward the sound
Mr
Smith's face is sideways on the pillow
The snores and a little drool burbles out of the corner of his mouth
The impact of something landing on the bed bounces Mr
Smith upright and awake
Ahhh
Ahhh
Ahhh
The beam from the penlight hits him in the face
He raises his hands to shield his eyes
Don't worry, if  were here to kill you, you would already be dead
The penlight leaves Mr
Smith and Mr
Brooks places it deliberately under his own chin casting long sinister shadows up his face
He's sitting on the bed next to Mr
Smith
After you left today,  realized our friendship was a little one- sided
() () 32
: (') So when we meet tomorrow night would you be so kind as to bring all of the pictures and the memory card from your camera
That way we can like each other simply for who we are
If you don't show up, will presume you've gone to the police and  will kill you
Even if go to jail because of you, someone will find you wherever you are and kill you
The penlight goes off
There's total silence
(squeaks) Mr
Brooks
He squints into the black
Mr
Brooks
Finally he gathers the courage to extend a shaky hand
The bedside lamp goes on
The room is empty
Cautiously Mr
Smith swings his legs out of bed and stands up
He forces himself to go to the door and from there curls his arm around the jamb into the darkness
The  light is dazzling
peek into the  shows there is nobody there
He continues on into the
His camera equipment is on the table
The tripod is still set up
There is no sign of Mr
Brooks
Mr
Smith eyes the front door
It's closed and the 'security chain' is in place
Another quick scan of the room
It sure seems that he's alone
He opens the front door the length of the chain and looks up and down the hallway
It's empty
Slowly he closes the door
Standing in the light of his  , Mr
Smith is more scared and strangely more excited than he's ever been in his life
Wow
33
In a robe and pajamas, Mr
Brooks comes down the carrying a glass of milk
The door to his Daughter's  is partly open
By the nightlight in the plug at the head of the bed he can see she's asleep
Mr
Brooks walks to the bed, leans over and kisses his Daughter on the cheek
(quietly) It's nice to have you home
He leaves
- The early rays of the sun are moving down the tall buildings
garbage truck is picking up the trash
Dressed for work and a smile on his face, Mr
Brooks comes down the stairs
In the  , the mood is decidedly different
His Wife and Daughter are leaning against opposite walls staring at the floor
What's wrong
Ask your daughter what the real reason is she dropped out of school
keep telling you it's not the reason
() 34
: You wanted to go to college, you had good grades in High School, your father helped you get into Stanford, we're paying a ton of money, if this is not the reason, then please dear God tell me the reason
(picking up an orange juice) Why does your mother think you dropped out of school
'm pregnant
(to her Mother) And it's not the reason  dropped out
Being pregnant wouldn't stop me from going to school if  wanted to go
Who's the father
Some guy  was seeing
Does he know
Yes, he's a married man and he doesn't want to have anything to do with me
Oh, Honey, 'm so sorry
'm going to have an abortion anyway, so there is nothing to get upset about
wasn't even going to tell you guys
Mr
Brooks looks directly at his Daughter
There will be no abortion
() 35
: (2) Daddy, you are not going to tell me what to do
It's my body and  will do what  want to do with it
Mr
Brooks's eyes find Emma's
Almost imperceptibly she shakes her head 'no'
(to his Daughter) You're right
'm sorry
said it wrong
'm not trying to tell you what to do
'm trying to say that a grandchild would be a wonderful gift for your mother and me
Please, Honey, don't have an abortion
Would you really want to have a grandchild, even though 'm not married
Yes
The child is what's important
We would love it and cherish it completely and help you raise it
If it means that much to you, 'll think about it
- Walking to the Lexus, Mr
Brooks notices Marshall waiting for him on the passenger side
(smiles) Well, we were right, she was hiding something
(flat) Pregnant's not all of it
She's hiding something bigger
Much bigger
You think so
() 36
: know so, and so do you
Large and small Color Photographs pinned to a corkboard create a Collage of the dance Couple murder scene
Standing in front of this is  , a tall slim open- faced Woman in her mid-fifties, and the lead Crime Scene Technician we saw earlier at the Murder House
It's not what's here, it's what's not here that's interesting
There's not a trace of anything foreign
If  didn't know better 'd say these people were killed by a ghost
The autopsy found a tiny piece of plastic in the female victim's brain
We're checking with the ammunition manufacturers
(entering the room) That's a dead end, he bags the gun
don't understand
He ziplocks a one gallon plastic freezer bag to his wrist over the gun
Bang
Bang
little bit of plastic is carried by the first slug, the ejected shells go into the bag and it limits the powder residue
(to Captain Lister) hear you were looking for me
(to the Technician) Sigy
() 37
: () Yeah, okay
(to Atwood) Did you find anything
Did they have enemies, did they owe money, did anybody ever notice someone watching the house
So far they are Mr
and Miss Normal
(backing away) If you find anything, call, it might help me
He's gone
received a subpoena from your husband's lawyer for your work records, where you were, date and times for the past two years
That's blackmail
Almost three quarters of your cases are current
can't let that information go into open court
So until you settle your divorce, 'm going to have to put you on a desk
That's also blackmail
That's one of your big problems, Atwood, you don't know how to ask for help
Do you know what he did to me
You can't grow old as a woman without having at least one lousy man in your life
() 38
: (2) was so stupid
While we were married, while  paid for him to live, the son of a bitch fucked every woman he could get his hands on
He fucked my friends, he even fucked a cousin of mine
Everyone knew but me, and they were laughing at me behind my back
He made me look like an idiot
was a joke
And
And what
Get over it
made him an offer
'm not going to give him one red cent more
hear what he's asking for, you could take out of pocket change
Do that and go on with your life
couldn't live with myself if did
'll spread your work among the other guys and the  will be here on thursday
(motions to the pictures) they'll take over this case
Please, these are my cases
Nobody knows them like me
Don't give them away and don't give the Thumbprint Killer to the
He's killed people in twelve other states, let them fuck up those investigations
This one's mine
() 39
: (3) (opening the door to leave) You heard Meeks escaped
Yeah
Do you want a detail on you in case he comes after you
can take care of myself
You're a good cop, Tracy,  don't want to lose you, but you have to help me if you want me to help you
Atwood is waiting for an elevator
It arrives
The doors open
The car is empty
Atwood gets in and presses the key for her destination, then slumps into a corner for the ride
The doors close
The elevator begins to move
All at once Atwood screams
Her pent-up anger and frustration rip the air and she goes nuts
She punches the wall of the elevator, kicks it, throws herself to the other side, bangs her head against that wall, punches it, kicks it, all the while screaming
Then the tears come
The screams stop and she settles upright against the back wall, where she strikes her chest repeatedly with the flat of her closed hand
What is wrong with me
What is wrong with me
What is wrong with me
It's raining
The yellow Police tape that still circles the yard snaps in the wind
() 40
: Up the driveway, out of sight of all the other homes, there's a movement at the side door of the house
closer inspection reveals that it's Detective Atwood
From under her umbrella she studies her surroundings and as if she's speaking to the killer, she speaks to herself
Did you choose them because of where they lived or how they looked or what jobs they had
Or did you just pick them because at the instant you saw them, you had decided to kill someone
The side door was perfect
No one could see you pick the lock
With a key she lets herself in
Parked against the curb opposite the driveway of the Murder House is an old green Pontiac Convertible with the top up
The driver's window is down and from inside a , late 20's, is watching the house
Atwood stops in the  almost in the exact spot where Mr
Brooks stopped
The quiet is filled by the rain drumming on the roof
The wind rattles the windows
How did you know where they were in the house
She steps into the
On the way across she bumps into a chair
It's darker tonight than it was on your night
But still how did you manage not to bump into the furniture
Did you have a little light
That would be too dangerous
'll bet you were in the house before
() () 41
: (') So  should ask the neighbors if they saw a meter reader around the house or a telephone repairman or someone from the gas company
These musings take her through the   to the entrance of the  where she pauses and looks both ways
Once again, how did you know where they were
Did you check the rooms before you found them
She had his semen in her vagina, they had just made love, did you hear them or was there a light on
She steps into the
And when did you bag the gun
Because even though 'm sure you're an expert at it, there's still a chance of noise from the plastic
She continues down the  to the
Was the door open or did you have to open it
She opens the door and goes in
Were they asleep or awake
Was the light on, or did you turn it on
Because  know you, you wouldn't risk a shot in the dark
She turns on the overhead light
Too bright
What if it wasn't that light that was on, but this one
She turns on a bedside light and goes back to the door and turns off the overhead
If the dance Couple were on the bed and their blood was not on the wall, the room would look exactly the way it did when Mr
Brooks said 'hello'
() 42
: (2) That's better
What thrill do you get by killing people
Is it sexual, is it hate, is it power
Do you feel remorse
Probably that part of your brain doesn't exist
Do you have emotions of love or affection or joy
Or have you learned to fake them so you won't stand out in a crowd
She's at the window now, feeling the curtains
What if these are stuck closed because you yanked them closed
Which means they were open when you came into the room
She separates the fabric and looks out the rain-streaked window at the four story building across the alley
There are lights on in almost all the apartment windows
If Mr
and Miss Normal made love with the curtains open and the lights on, someone in that building noticed them and may have seen you
She allows the fabric to drop back into place and turns to look at the bed
Was that what you were angry about
Moving slowly across a neutral colored wall
(
) Thank you for your time
door is closed
We come to the corner and are looking down a  at Atwood coming toward us
We move to her and arrive just as she raises her fist to knock
Before she can, the door opens and she and Mr
Smith who is on his way out of his Apartment are surprised that the other one is suddenly there
Each one takes a half step back
Phwap
The manila envelope that was wedged under Mr
Smith's left arm hits the floor
() 43
: Oh
You scared me
'm sorry
(bends down and picks up the envelope) was about to knock
'm Detective Atwood with the Chicago Police
(accepting the envelope) Thank you
Through the open door, Atwood can see Mr
Smith's camera on a table and the collapsed tripod leaning against the wall
Are you a photographer
(glances at her list) Mr
Baffert
No
eh, it's kind of a hobby, just started
don't know if you're aware but there was a murder
Oh, yes in the house across the alley
Did you happen to see anything unusual or suspicious that night around that house
Anything at all
Mr
Smith puts on his thinking expression and pauses a little bit before: No
wondered that when  heard what happened, but
no
(looks at his watch) 'm sorry, 'm meeting someone and don't want to be late
He moves into the Hallway closing the door behind him
() 44
: (2) Here's my card, if you hear anything or remember anything
(taking the card) wish  could be of more help, but sorry
Watching him walk away amid the crinkle of his raincoat, Detective Atwood, maybe because of her woman's intuition or maybe because she's a good cop, wonders what is in that manila envelope under his arm
The thought is gone almost as soon as it comes and she faces about to the next door
Hunched against the rain, Mr
Smith is acutely aware of the traffic
His eyes strain to see the Occupants of each passing car
He doesn't give a second thought to the older non- descript Toyota parked against the far curb
Mr
Brooks is in the driver's seat
Marshall is in the back
They're both tracking the progress of Mr
Smith
He looks clean
He looks like he's alone
No, 'm telling you he wants to do this
guess  should turn around and go pick him up
Nah
Just honk
Maybe he'll get killed crossing the street and save us the mess of doing it
Honk
Honk
Mr
Smith looks around
He's not sure that sound was for him
But when the Toyota honks again and flashes it's lights, Mr
Smith waves and splashes to the center of the street
() 45
: Even though he stops to let it pass, a car sounds its horn and swerves to avoid him
Mr
Smith crosses behind the Toyota and opens the passenger door
Mr
Smith flops into the seat
Woof
It's really coming down out there
They say it'll be sunny tomorrow
Mr
Smith fumbles with the buttons and zipper on his raincoat
never trust those guys, when they say it's going to be clear it always rains and when they say it's going to rain, it's sunny
He comes up with the manila envelope
Here's what you asked for
Mr
Brooks takes it and hefts it
The pictures and the memory card all here
Yeah
You and  both know that not all the pictures are in here and you made a copy of the Memory Card, isn't that so
But you understand my position
Mr
Brooks favors him with a wolfish smile
() 46
: Yes,  do
But it's my hope that once you get to know me better you'll feel comfortable in giving me all that 've asked for
That sounds fair
Oh,  almost forgot
thought you might be interested in this
His hand comes forward with a card
It's the policewoman who's looking for you
Marshall snaps forward from the back seat
Wow
We've never known anyone who's looking for us before
Mr
Brooks pinches the rectangle of paper away from Mr
Smith for a closer view
We've got to find out everything there is to know about this woman
This is too close, Marshall, too damn close
Mr
Smith interrupts Mr
Brooks's focus on Detective Atwood's card
So, what do we do now
What's the plan for the evening
Mr
Brooks slips the envelope under the seat and starts the car
We drive around until we see someone we think we might enjoy killing
Really
That's it
thought you might already have someone in mind
() 47
: (2) don't enjoy this, Mr
Smith
do it because 'm addicted to it
And before you entered my life  had vowed  would never kill again
So this is your party, you can chose anyone you want and we'll do it together
Can it be someone  know
You never kill someone you know
That's the easiest way to get caught
The Toyota enters the traffic
An older  in a Stewardess uniform is standing in the doorway of her apartment
Atwood is in front of her in the wasn't in town that night, my roommate was, maybe he saw something
May  speak to him
He's on his way to Tokyo now, he's also a Flight Attendant
Did the victims ever leave the curtains in the bedroom open
All the time
don't know if they thought we couldn't see them "fucking" or they didn't care
() 48
: Here's my card, could you ask your roommate to call me when he gets back, the people at that number will find me any hour of the day or night
won't be here, but 'll leave him a note
Mr
Brooks' Toyota is cruising in the flow of traffic
(
) maybe  already know how to pick the locks on the house, if don't
buy one of those locks and practice on it, same with the alarm
some  know how to bypass, some  have to study
You don't mind me asking these questions
No
This is your first time, you're interested
And you should be if you're
neutral-colored  swerves out of the next lane into Mr
Brooks' lane
Jesus Christ
Mr
Brooks is forced to slam on his brakes to avoid running up the ' tailpipe
Mr
Brooks angrily lays on the horn
The brake lights of the  flash in response causing Mr
Brooks to brake again
() 49
: Fuck him
It was his fault
What an asshole
(leans forward) Maybe Mr
Smith would like to kill the driver of the pickup
(to Mr
Smith) What about the driver of the pickup
What if we killed him
Oh, fuck, yes
've always wanted to kill someone who fucked with me in traffic
The  makes a right onto a side street
Mr
Brooks follows
Do you want to kill the driver of the pickup or the owner, they may not be the same
The driver
Okay we'll follow until we get a look at him, or her; would it bother you to kill a woman
No
An asshole's an asshole
Mr
Brooks begins to slow down
What are you doing
The asshole shouldn't know we've decided to follow him, or her
- Detective Atwood is on her way out the Outer Door when the hair on the back of her neck stands on end
() 50
: Footsteps can be heard running toward her through the rain
Her hand goes under her jacket and comes out holding a Glock 9mm
She sidesteps out of the light into the grayness at the edge of the doorway
Now she sees the
hood hides the face
She can't tell if it's a Man or a Woman
Detective Atwood thumbs the Glock's safety to the 'off' position
The Runner passes, white breath coming from an unseen mouth
She waits while the Figure recedes, then with the gun still in hand she fishes into a pocket for a cell phone and heads in the opposite direction
finger speedials a number
After a second ring a: (answers) Yes
(puts the phone to her ear) It's Tracy
Can you carve out some time for me tonight
'll be home in an hour and a half
'll see you there
The phone is shut, the umbrella unfurled and the darkness swallows her up
The neutral-colored Pickup is parked in front
The gets out
It has stopped at the curb just beyond the Entrance to the Mini-Mart parking lot
Mr
Brooks and Mr
Smith watch the  come around the front of another car before entering the store
The light reveals the Driver to be a tall middle-age preppie guy with close cropped dark hair and dark-rimmed glasses
() 51
: Would you recognize him if you saw his driver's license picture
Yeah
've memorized the license number, you write it down
When you get home go on the Internet and find out everything you can about this guy
We aren't going to kill him tonight
No
We could, but then we wouldn't be in control
We could leave loose ends, and we both know the danger of that
(squints at the Pickup's license) got it
Look at me
Mr
Smith does
Close your eyes
What's the number
eh
Mr
Smith opens his eyes and grins sheepishly
Don't feel bad, 've been doing this a long time
(he points to a holder on the dash) Pen, paper
Write it down
(copying the number) What was your first time
() 52
: (2) You really don't want to know that much about me, Mr
Smith
The lane lines are in place
Detective Atwood is the only one in the water
Up and down she goes with a long smooth stroke flipping the turns
She's not swimming for pleasure, she's working out
The underwater lights cast rippling shadows on the walls and ceiling and since they are the only illumination, the room feels spooky
Atwood's fingers touch the wall
She raises her head to check her time, then takes off her goggles
Hanging onto the gutter she tries to catch her breath, lowers herself under the surface, blows a lungful of bubbles, comes up to face , a Man slightly younger than she is, in a beautiful suit, perched on the edge of the deck looking down at her
He has a dress on a hangar over one shoulder and a pair of shoes dangling from the fingers of his other hand
Hi
Hi
brought a dress and a pair of shoes
thought we could leave from here
Great idea
She lifts herself to him and they kiss
Detective Atwood and Larry are at a balcony table overlooking a well-populated dance floor
The Music is 40's and 50's performed by a live
gave him my driver's license, my student , he didn't look anything like me, luckily they never checked
() 53
: did something like that except was the one who took the test
It wasn't math, a friend of mine was a theology major and needed a second language to get into the Master's program
She started her career in theology with a lie
Isn't that what all theology is based on
Did you pass the test
Oh yeah
Don't tell me she ended up as Mother Teresa or the Pope
No, she realized very quickly there wasn't enough money in religion for her, the last  heard she'd written a diet book that was very successful
She stayed in religion
Atwood smiles, her fingers find Larry's and they intertwine
The view floats over the balcony
As it slowly drops, the  on the dance floor, Couple by Couple, disappear until there are only three Couples left, one of them is Atwood and Larry
Her head is on his shoulder
It's a slow dance
Larry is very good and wherever he leads, Atwood easily follows
The lights begin to dim and we move in
Larry touches his lips to Atwood's neck
She arches back and he kisses her neck again and again
() 54
: (2) His lips move up and find hers, and we are now close on the kiss
Gently the lips separate and we slowly retreat
Looking into her eyes, Larry traces her lips with a finger, then replaces that finger with his tongue
His lips brush a cheek, down her neck to where it meets her shoulder, his teeth close softly on the muscle, by now we are far enough away to realize that Atwood and Larry have no clothes on and we are: -  ' What light there is, is coming from a room we can't see
Larry nibbles at Atwood collarbone, kisses a breast, strokes his hands down her sides
She shivers
He brushes his lips back and forth across her stomach and then down to where the flesh of her belly meets her pubic hair
She's watching all of this in a mirror on the opposite wall
Then he sinks to his knees and buries his head between her legs
From low in her throat, Atwood moans
We lose sight of the Couple as we move around a corner
'  - It's dark
Atwood is propped up against the headboard, the sheet pulled up over her breasts
The door to the  opens
Larry dressed in his suit, minus the tie, comes out, kneels on the bed and kisses her
Thank you, this was wonderful
For me too
'll see you then
'd like that
The money is in the usual place
It's not just the money, Tracy like you
() 55
: like you too, Larry
Send me a bill for the dress and the shoes
will
Good-night
Good-night
' The rain is muffled by the trees
Move slowly toward the Building then up the side to peek through the narrow window that circles just below the roof line
In the center of the room, the kiln relieves the darkness with a yellow red glow whose rim touches a slash of white light coming from under a door tucked in a corner
We creep through the white light across the floor that's littered with splashes of paint and smears of clay to the office door and peer under it
In front of us are chair casters and two bare feet and legs
(
) think that was right
Go back
(
) We're in
(
) With the taxes we pay, you'd think they could make it more difficult to hack into the Police personnel files
We tip toe under the door
- It's crammed with file cabinets
Sketches for pottery pieces are taped to the walls along with photos of Mr
Brooks, Jane and Emma
() 56
: Mr
Brooks, clad only in a -shirt and underwear, is sitting in front of a computer
Marshall, dressed as he usually is, is in a chair at his side
They are both staring at the monitor where on one side of the screen is Detective Atwood's Police  photo, on the other side of the screen, Mr
Brooks is scrolling through her personnel file
Huh
her father's Gerald Atwood, why does that ring a bell
Someone you did business with, someone we killed
Not someone we killed
College of William and Mary
she's been a cop for eleven years
Married Doctor Carlson, divorced Dr
Carlson, married Jesse Vialo
restaurateur
separated from Jesse Vialo, sued for support by Jesse Vialo, seeing a shrink because of Jesse Vialo
Excellent fitness report though
She caught the Hangman, the guy that escaped the other day
Oooh
She's caught a lot of people
And look here, this isn't the first time she's been hunting for us
wonder what the deal was with her and Jesse Vialo
Mr
Brooks taps a key that minimizes Atwood's file then drags it to the right hand corner
In the middle of a key stroke it hits him: () 57
: (2) Ahhhh
now  remember
Her father, Gerald Atwood, never did business with him but Emma and met him a couple times, big political fundraiser
He owns or owned one of the largest insurance groups in the country and a lot of other stuff
Tap, tap, tap
Jesse Vialo's Driver's license comes up
Jesse Vialo
Good looking, a little younger than she is
Younger, restaurateur
(snorts) She married him on the rebound from the doctor and 'll bet he married her for her money and her connections
The old man being rich doesn't mean she's rich
Maybe he's one of those guys who would rather give it to the Opera than to his kids
Wouldn't she have to declare any outside income and holdings to the Police
Hmmm
He restores Atwood's file
Tap, tap, tap, tap
Stop
The Men study the screen then look at each other
The Opera didn't get much
Why would a woman with her education and worth 60 plus million dollars and probably more to come, want to be a cop
like that about her
() 58
: (3) You're such a fucking snob, Earl
You like her because she's rich
No,  like her because she found something that's hers
It's not the family business
And she's good at it
'd like Jane to find something that's hers and that she could be good at
That's exactly why Atwood scares the shit out of me
She's a cop who doesn't need the money and she's looking for us
That's one fucking dangerous human being
The fact that you're not wrong doesn't make me admire her any less
At a table the Asian Attorney is going over a brief
There are two foamy coffees in to-go cups in front of her
Detective Atwood arrives at the table
Hi
She reaches out, the Women shake hands
Hi
got you a Latte
(sitting) Thanks and thanks for meeting me here
We got an injunction to quash the subpoena for your work records yesterday
They've already appealed
That doesn't help me does it
() 59
: Your father has a lot of political muscle
My father does nothing for nothing
understand
If you're willing to play the game and ride a desk for a year;  think we can settle for one two five, one five
No desk
Then the only other option is money
Tell me how high you are willing to go
One five
can try
If  were on the other side 'd hold out for more
How much more
Give me a cap and that's how high we'll go
Try and get a number out of them first
want to know what ballpark 'm playing in and if it's a lump sum, is it less than something that's paid in installments
'll call them today
Atwood stands up with her coffee
'd like to get this done as soon as possible
() 60
: (2) The Asian Attorney also stands and gathering her papers and coffee
Are you working on the Thumbprint Killer this time
Yeah
That one's creepy to me
The doors are locked, the alarms are armed and the people are dead
It makes you feel like you're not safe anywhere
Atwood nods and opens the front door then follows the Attorney out
Where are you parked
'm right over there
'm down the street
Call me as soon as you have something
She starts to walk away
Oh, Tracy
almost forgot, your husband says there's a picture of him holding some trophy that you still have
He took all those pictures
He took everything
He claims it's his favorite picture and you put it up where you store your suitcases
'll look
() 61
: know it's petty, but you're going through a divorce
Atwood strides toward her car
The  traffic is light
It's too early for the stores to be open
Up ahead a   is idling at the curb, the sliding side door is open
Atwood can see inside
Empty except for some furniture blankets
The Person in the Driver's seat turns to look into the back
It's the Woman who was watching Atwood outside the Murder House
Her hands are unseen in leather gloves
She looks up and their eyes meet
Two strangers
The contact is instantly broken
Atwood takes a deep breath and smiles
After the rain, the air is brisk and clean
It's good to be alive
Atwood is body-checked by a Man who springs out of the recess of a doorway
His arms wrap around her, she's lifted off her feet and the Man throws himself and her into the Van
- Oooff
The wind is knocked out of Atwood when she lands left shoulder first on the furniture blankets, the Man on top of her
The Man is Thorton Meeks, the Hangman, six feet, a solid two hundred pounds
He's also wearing tight leather gloves
The Brown Van accelerates fast away from the curb
His body crushing hers, Meeks kisses Atwood's cheek
Surprise, surprise, Tracy
told you  was coming back to get you
He frees his right hand and pulls his gun
() 62
: already know where 'm gonna hang you
But first 'm gonna watch her
(indicates the Driver) have some fun with you, then she's gonna watch me have some fun with you
He kisses her again and puts the gun to Atwood's head
Now, don't move
He raises up and straddles her
You know the drill, 'm gonna put the cuffs on
With his left hand he fishes a pair of handcuffs from a back pocket and snaps them on Atwood's right wrist
Now the left
He rolls Atwood on her back and with the chain of the handcuff pulls her right arm toward her left
All Meeks' talk has allowed Atwood to catch her breath and suddenly she jerks her head up into the gun and screams at the top of her lungs
At the same time she pulls hard against the handcuff with her right wrist
startled Meeks is thrown off balance
The gun comes away from Atwood's head
Her left arm now free, Atwood swings her palm with all of her might into Meeks' right ear
His eardrum breaks
Aaaggh
He instinctually reaches to cover the damaged ear with his gun hand
The Driver doubles around to see what's happening
From outside,
The Driver's attention returns to the road
() 63
: (2) Atwood swings again
This time she snags the barrel of the gun and using it as a lever bends Meeks' hand back on the wrist
The gun goes off
Neither one of them is hit
At the same time Atwood pulls hard on the handcuff that Meeks is holding in his left hand and twists into him
This dislodges Meeks and he's off of her
Snarling like animals they fight for the gun
Atwood's leverage breaks Meeks' trigger finger
His grip loosens on the weapon
She pulls it out of his hand
quick push skitters it across the floor
It drops through the open side door into the street
Atwood rolls away and reaches for her ankle gun
Now it's Meeks' turn
sharp tug on the chain of the handcuff stalls her motion
He flicks his other arm and a switchblade is delivered into his right hand
Snap
The blade comes out
Atwood is reaching again for her ankle gun
She sees the flash of metal and flings her head back
Luckily all she receives is a deep gash above her right eye
Blood immediately begins to cascade over her brow
Meeks grins and gives another sharp tug on the handcuff to pull Atwood into the range of his knife
With one foot Atwood kicks at him, with the other she pushes off and propels herself backward to grab a handful of the Driver's hair
Atwood's weight hinges the Driver's head back until she's looking at the ceiling
Her scream is equal parts pain and surprise
The Brown Van veers into the on-coming traffic
The Driver of the car dead ahead swerves
The Van solidly clips the rear of that car
- The sudden deceleration of that impact slingshots Atwood and Meeks forward
She hits the back of the Driver's seat
() 64
: Meeks has further to go
He loses his hold on the handcuffs and smashes into the passenger seat
Her right hand now free, Atwood scratches for the gun on her hip
Careening across its lane, the Van sideswipes a parked car
That impact rips Atwood's hand out of the Driver's hair and sends her sliding on her knees toward the side door
On her way she unclips her gun and is bringing it out of her holster when Meeks who has managed to hang onto the passenger seat sees this and slams a foot into her chest
Atwood is launched backward out the side door
In slow motion Atwood flies through the air while at normal speed the Van is leaving her behind
Butt first, Atwood hammers into the back window of a parked car
The shattering glass breaks her fall
Groggily she rolls out of the indentation
Gun still in hand and blood covering one side of her face she slides off the car to stand in the street
The Van is nowhere in sight
Captain Lister is watching a  sew up the gash on Detective Atwood's forehead
We found the van in an underground lot about two miles from where they left you
It was stolen last night
Detective Snyder comes in and hands a packet of photographs to Atwood
These are the women we have pictures of who know Meeks
() 65
: Meeks and the Woman, none of the Attendants remember seeing them
As Detective Atwood begins to go through the pictures
That chiropractor, Alvin Griffin, who sold Meeks his steroids, he might know where he is
His phone's been tapped since Meeks escaped
No contact that way so far and he's sure not going to talk to us
What about a warrant to search his house
Get me in the door and he'll talk to me
How's your divorce going
took your advice and told my lawyer to settle
Stretching out her arm to return the photos: None of these is the woman in the van
Whoa
'm sewing up your head here
Sorry
And your ego can handle that
It doesn't like any of the other choices
Until Meeks is caught, Snyder is with you
() 66
: (2) Nothing personal, Snyder
(to Lister) He's not part of our team
He's there to protect you
And listen to him, he's been alive longer than you have
didn't volunteer for this, Atwood
The Parking Lot has a security camera
We're checking the tape
If Meeks and the Woman left in a car we'll have a license number
You have two days then  want a progress report on your divorce
think  have all the pieces on the Thumbprint Killer, 'm just not looking at them the right way
Okay, you have three days
She leaves
(smiles sweetly at Snyder) Every babysitter  ever had loved me
In the scattering of vehicles Mr
Brooks' Toyota is hidden in plain sight in a row of cars
Behind the wheel, Mr
Brooks is again wearing his Pottery- Throwing clothes
Mr
Smith is in the passenger seat and Marshall is leaning forward from the back
They're all focused to varying degrees on the Entrance to the store
Mr
Smith raises his watch for a look at the time
() 67
: Maybe he went home with someone else
Can you still see his pickup
Mr
Smith looks
Uh huh
This is not the kind of guy who leaves his pickup in an unguarded Lot overnight
The silence returns
All three Men idly observe an old green Pontiac convertible with a frayed top and paint peeling, come into the Lot and park two spaces away facing them
We saw this car last watching Atwood from outside the Murder House
The headlights go off
The Driver's door opens
The Woman who was with Meeks in the Van steps out and hurries toward the Drug Store
She of course means nothing to Mr
Brooks but in the brief seconds the domelight is on, he catches sight of the Man in the passenger seat
memory tickles his brain
He turns to Marshall
Where do we know that guy from
You really should pay more attention to what you read, Earl
That's what  have you for, Marshall
His picture was on the front page of the paper a couple days ago because he escaped from jail
He's the killer they call the Hangman
() 68
: (2) Ahh
Remember that cop you like, Atwood, who's chasing us, she's the one who put him away
think his name is Thorton Meeks
Mr
Brooks cocks his head at the vague outline of Meeks
Well, well, well
What would life be without surprises
Mr
Smith who, remember, cannot hear or see Marshall, straightens up
There he is
The Man they are waiting for is coming down the steps of the store
On the way to his Pickup he takes off a Manager's smock
You know what's weird
'll bet he has all these plans of what he's going to do tonight and tomorrow and he doesn't know he will already be dead and won't be able to do any of them
Mr
Brooks nods absently
The Drug Store Manager arrives at his truck
don't think  want to kill this guy
What
But you promised we would
Marshall smiles
Oh,  love what you're thinking
You have no idea what 'm thinking
() 69
: (3) Oh yes  do, and it's wonderfully twisted
(to Mr
Smith) know  said we would, but  don't think it would be that much fun
Mr
Brooks starts the car and puts it in reverse
So just like that, you're saying 'no', it's not going to happen
Yes
(purses his lips into a tight line) see
Mr
Brooks casts his eyes on the license plate of the car Meeks is in
You get the number
got it
Mr
Brooks' Toyota leaves
Mr
Smith sits stiffly
His expression hasn't changed
Mr
Smith wants you to notice he's pouting
Yeah,  know
The Toyota is part of the light traffic
70
The Toyota comes into view around a corner and stops next to the sidewalk
know you're upset, Mr
Smith, and 'm sorry
Yeah,  am upset
Maybe  was a little abrupt back there, but let me explain
Finding someone you think would be fun to kill is a bit like falling in love
You meet a lot of candidates, and you like some of them and they're nice, but they're not right; and then that special one shows up and your heart beats faster and you know that's the one
The man in the pickup did not make my heart beat faster
Okay, he did not make your heart beat faster
If not him, who
don't know,  think  have someone in mind
Do you need me to do any work on it
No, let's see how it plays out
You see
That's my problem
That makes me feel like 'm being jerked around, Mr
Brooks
thought it was happening last night, then it was happening tonight
And now it's "Let's see how it plays out"
() () 71
: (') feel like you're planning to back out on our deal and  don't like that feeling at all
promise you, it will happen
When
That's what  want to know, Mr
Brooks
When
Tomorrow night, same time
When you come out of your building, turn right, go to the first street you can go west on, 'll pick you up on that street
Okay
He gets out and with the door still open, turns back
want to do this
But if it drags on too long,  could change my mind
Don't you think  want to do this, Mr
Smith
Maybe you don't anymore
He shuts the door
Marshall and Mr
Brooks watch him walk away
Even if that guy was charming and funny  still wouldn't like him
The Toyota -turns, makes the corner and is lost from sight
- The garage door opens and Mr
Brooks swings the Toyota inside
72
- Mr
Brooks steps out of the Toyota onto a sheet of plastic
Two strides away is an industrial vacuum cleaner
Mr
Brooks vacuums the passenger seat and dash and floor and everything around it
- Mr
Brooks removes his shoes and leaves them on the plastic, then slips his feet into paper slippers
With handiwipes he wipes down the outside of the passenger door, in fact anything on that side Mr
Smith could have touched
He opens the door and wipes down the seat and the dash and the console
Back on the plastic, Mr
Brooks undresses
On top of his clothes he drops the used handiwipes, the slippers and the vacuum bag
The corners of the plastic sheet are folded up, twisted together and Zip-tied to create a nice neat package which Mr
Brooks picks up and takes into the Ceramics Studio
- Mr
Brooks rinses off the lather under the spray
The glow from 3000 degrees Fahrenheit is coming through the window of the kiln
- The Driver's license, complete with picture, of the Woman who was with Meeks in the Drug Store parking lot, is up on the computer screen
Mr
Brooks, now back in his regular clothes, brings the cursor down to the address
He scores this and drags it into Yahoo Maps 'driving directions'
route is generated
Mr
Brooks brings the cursor up to 'Print' and clicks
() 73
: on his Printer
The map is fed out and settles into the tray
An unmarked Police car stops on the gravel of the Turn- Around
Two Plainclothes  get out and walk to the front door
The taller One rings the bell and they wait and then the door is opened by Mr
Brooks
In a flash he takes in the car and the way the Men are dressed and although his face doesn't betray it, he knows what they are
Hi, what can  do for you
The shorter One holds up a badge
1 'm Detective Smolny with the Chicago Police and this is Detective Carfagno, from Palo Alto, California
( 2) (showing his badge) We'd like to speak to Jane Brooks, if that's possible
Jane is my daughter, what's this about
There was a murder at Stanford not long before she left
She may be able to help us
Is she a suspect
Not at this time
We simply would like to ask her some questions
( 1) Is your daughter here
() 74
: Yes
she is
The questions won't take long
'm sure you would have no objection if she had an attorney present
That's fine
(reaching into his pocket) Here's my card
We can schedule a time for later today or tomorrow for her to come in to see us
Mr
Brooks looks at the card
If you gentlemen can wait,  will call my lawyer right now and see what we can work out
Oh, that's even better
(opening the door wider) Would you like some coffee
Thank you
- Marshall is walking alongside a very disturbed Mr
Brooks
We both knew she was hiding something bigger,  certainly didn't think it was this big
She's not a suspect, Marshall
She may not have anything to do with it at all
Mr
Brooks opens a door
The room that is revealed is a very well equipped home
() 75
: In sweats and wearing a Walkman, Emma is working out on an Elliptical machine
Mr
Brooks motions to her that he wants to talk
Emma takes off the headphones and pauses the machine
Did Jane ever tell you that there was a murder at her school
No
Nothing
Not that a friend died or someone she knew died
Or someone in her dorm died
No
There are two Detectives downstairs, one is from Palo Alto, they want to ask her some questions about a murder that occurred shortly before she came home
Oh, my Gosh
'm sure if she was close to someone who was murdered, she would have said something
called Roger, he suggested a criminal attorney, they'll be here within the hour
'll get dressed
There are now three cars plus the unmarked Police car in the Turn-Around
Everyone is in the
() 76
: Jane is on a couch flanked by her Mother and a
Standing behind them is a heavyset  and a
We've never seen any of these Men before
Facing this Group from the opposite couch are the two Detectives
There are two tape recorders on the coffee table
Mr
Brooks is in a chair off to one side watching everything
For him the conversation is merely a burble of voices
He studies his daughter while she answers a question
She is unaware of his scrutiny
And finally all he can see are her lips moving
Even the burble has faded to silence
The unmarked Police car with the two Detectives pulls away
We move in on the front door
It opens
The Lawyers spill out
Mr
Brooks shakes hands with the lawyer who was sitting on the couch next to Jane
Mr
Clifford, it was a pleasure
Thank you for coming on such short notice
There won't be any more dropping by like they did today, they'll call us first
Thanks again, Roger
It was a good idea to hear what they wanted to know sooner rather than later
We'll talk
Yup
He waves and re-enters the house
Mr
Brooks shuts the door and turning, finds himself face to face with Emma and Jane
The Women are both worried
He and his Daughter look at each other
For a brief instant each one tries to find what they hope to find in the other
() 77
: Mr
Brooks smiles and folds the Girl into his arms
You did good, Kid
Your answers were clear, concise and honest
And when they tried to trip you up, it didn't work
hope so
'm not feeling so well
Should you lie down
think 'd better
Mr
Brooks kisses his daughter on the top of the head
Try and get some sleep
Jane bends her steps toward the stairs
(to Emma) think Roger has a handle on this
He and Mr
Clifford will take care of it
Emma takes her Husband's hand and after squeezing it follows her Daughter
On the stairs Jane stops and looks back
'm sorry  didn't tell you about it, Daddy
It was horrible but really didn't know the guy that well
It happened at about the same time  found out  was pregnant, and it just went out of my mind
understand
Jane resumes her journey up the stairs
: on a water glass being filled from a tap
() 78
: (2) (
) God grant me the Serenity to accept the things  cannot change, Courage to change the things  can, and Wisdom to know the difference
- With a shaky hand, Mr
Brooks raises the glass to his lips
God help me
What do  do
Sitting on the island behind him Marshall waits for Mr
Brooks to gulp the glass dry
She did it, didn't she
Yeah
It'll take the Cops a week to ten days to put their case together and then they'll come back and arrest her
What are you going to do
Mr
Brooks puts his hands over his eyes and sobs, then wiping away the tears: 've been afraid of this since the day she was born
She has what have
Yes, she does
But you've always been smart about it
She was stupid
She did it because she got off on it, she did it for fun
Why didn't she think it through hatchet
And she left it there
They were pretty graphic, weren't they
That was to shock her into making a mistake
() 79
: What does she think  think
Doesn't she remember what she told me
That the  was being driven across country by a friend and now right in front of me, she tells the Cops it was stolen
You've always cleaned up after her, whatever she did, all her life
If the  has anything incriminating in it,  hope it was stolen or she dropped it at the bottom of a very deep lake
Do you think she knows what kind of trouble she's in
think she thought she had gotten away with it until the Cops showed up
should have listened to her, it was there
She was telling me
' didn't quit school because  was pregnant'
should have dug deeper
And where would you be but at the exact same place you are now
It is not your fault, Earl
Part of your problem with her is that you always think it is
She has what  have, Marshall
So on a very basic level, it is my fault
What are you going to do
Maybe the best thing for her would be to let her go to jail
And what about her child
() 80
: (2) Emma and  would raise it
You might be right, Earl, you might be
Because you know if she's not stopped, she's going to do it again
And if she wants to take over the box business, the next victim could be you
don't think she'd go that far
slide of what looks like enlarged grains of sand among giant carpet fibers is projected onto a screen
The Lead Crime Lab Technician: (
) We found traces of this in two places
The slide changes to an overhead schematic showing the interior of the house where the dance Couple was murdered
Detective Atwood and Detective Snyder are standing with Sigy watching the presentation
Atwood has a bandage covering the stitches over her eye
(with a laser pointer) Here and here
The red dot indicates an area just outside the Kitchen and just outside the Bedroom
We did an analysis and it's made up of feldspar, alumina and kaolin
What's that
high fire stoneware clay
Like you make ashtrays and vases from
() 81
: This is more plates and teacups
It was slightly wet when whoever it was tracked it into the house and it stuck to the carpet fibers
We're thinking it was the killer
It could have been tracked in by a friend
That's the thing, you see, the friend would have had to have been there almost at the same time the killer was
Otherwise the samples would have been dry and the killer would have vacuumed them up
Is the clay rare, is it difficult to get
You can buy it almost anywhere
That's not much help, Sigy
And this is the only incongruity you were able to find in the whole house
We've done everything we know how to do
It sure doesn't break the case wide open, does it
No, Sigy, it doesn't
It does give me an excuse to ask someone some new questions
'      - Mr
Brooks is standing behind his desk staring blankly at the contents of his briefcase when Sunday, his Secretary, comes in
Yes, Mr
Brooks
() 82
: Mr
Brooks doesn't immediately answer her, he's lost in thought
(from the couch) Before you open your mouth, be very sure this is the right thing to do
will never be sure
Remember; Sunday can neither see nor hear Marshall
You get pissed at me because 'm always the one arguing to go ahead and do murder
Not this time, Earl
This is your decision
know it's wrong
In my heart know it's wrong
Then don't do it
Go with Mr
Smith tonight and end that, then let the Police put Jane in jail
Hopefully that will save her and we can happily go on with our tortured lives
That's exactly what  want to do
That's exactly what  should do
The thing is, she's my daughter and love her
Mr
Brooks raises his head and looks at Sunday
'm going home
Cancel everything for the rest of the day
might be in tomorrow afternoon
'll let you know about that
'll take care of it
If you need me, need me, call my studio, that's where 'll be
() () 83
: (2) (') probably won't pick up, just leave a message
'll try not to bother you
The door closes behind her
With a hidden lever, Mr
Brooks lowers casters under the kiln and rolls it aside to reveal a Combination Safe imbedded in the concrete floor
He spins the dial, opens the Safe and extracts four quadruple- pocketed plastic sleeves which he lines up in front of himself
Each sleeve contains a Driver's License, two Credit cards and cash
The pictures on the Driver's Licenses are of Mr
Brooks, but you wouldn't immediately recognize him because of the disguises
As he's trying to decide which of the four Identities would be best for what he has in mind, Marshall comes forward to look over his shoulder
The thing that bothers me about this, besides the fact we're not prepared, and a multitude of other things, is what does Mr
Smith do when he's walking west tonight and you don't show up
That little freak could flip out
Mr
Brooks chooses the first sleeve and the third sleeve
The other two go back into the Safe
'll take care of it on the way to the airport
It's in an Industrial Park
Mr
Smith exits one of the doors and continues on into the Parking Lot to a moderately expensive foreign car sitting in a space identified by a sign which reads: () 84
: Mr
Baffert
He squeezes the 'disarm' button on his key chain
The car chirps twice and he opens the door
Bending his knees to get in, he stops
There is a section of Newspaper wedged in the steering wheel
When his brain unlocks he straightens up and moving only the top of his body, makes a quick recon of the surrounding area and his back seat
Nothing threatening seen, he eases into the seat
Slam
The door is closed and locked
Gingerly, Mr
Smith removes the Newspaper
It folds open
On the first page there are words circled in red
As his eyes dart from one to the other we go in close on the words and hear Mr
Brooks say them as Mr
Smith finds them
(
) Not - able - to - meet - Mr
Smith turns the page
(
) - tonight - Do - it - same - Turns the page
(
) - time - tomorrow - Turns the page
- night - Don't - be - stupid -
Mr
Smith refolds the Newspaper and throws it at the passenger seat
Fuck you
He inserts the key into the ignition
-
There's a sudden sharp
, on the Driver's window
() 85
: Mr
Smith levitates off the seat
Unable to breathe, he turns
Detective Atwood's face lowers into view
You remember me
All Mr
Smith can do is nod
Would you step out of the car, please,  want to talk to you
Atwood steps back as Mr
Smith gets out
Behind her, Detective Snyder is standing next to the Driver's door of an un-marked Police car which has blocked Mr
Smith in
So Mr
Baffert, what is that you have to tell me
What do you mean
don't have anything to tell you
Really
Because  was driving around and  got this sudden feeling that you had something to tell me about the murders
No
Nothing
That's disappointing
Because when left you the last time we talked, felt  had missed a clue that was right in front of me that would solve this whole case
don't know why you would feel that
Didn't you tell me you were an amateur potter, that you made bowls and vases
() 86
: No,  said  was an amateur photographer
Are you positive
Because we found potter's clay on the carpet of the murder house and  was sure you said to me that you worked with clay, that you made pots
No
said my hobby was photography, not pottery
Maybe that was it
The Stewardess upstairs said the victims kept their curtains open when they made love
Could  see some of the pictures you took of that Couple
Mr
Smith can only stare at Detective Atwood
His Adam's apple moves up and down though he makes no sound
Should he or shouldn't he
Finally he throws his arms up in a shrug but in his half-turn of indecision he happens to spy the Newspaper he tossed at the passenger seat of his car
Part of it is draped over the console
The red circles around the words on that page jump out at him
(
) Don't - be - stupid -
Mr
Smith returns his attention to Detective Atwood
You are harassing me, Detective Atwood
You know very well 'm not a potter and  don't have any pictures
So my feeling is that your feeling is wrong and that you should move your car and let me go home
What is your job here
What do you do
() 87
: (2) 'm a mechanical engineer
You have to be pretty smart for that, don't you
guess
Then be smart, Mr
Baffert
You lied to me right there at the end
'll be watching you
And when you want to tell me the truth, you know how to get in touch with me
She gives him a dazzling smile
See you later, alligator
Atwood walks back to her car and gets in
(under her breath) Goddamit
As Snyder accelerates away he points to the car's computer screen
Captain Lister got us the search warrant for Meeks' Chiropractor
Good
(shakes her head 'no', frustrated) Goddamit
, that guy knows something
(meaning Mr
Smith) He almost told me and then something happened
You think he did it
don't think it's that simple
88
Mr
Smith watches the unmarked police car going away and wipes the sweat out of his hairline
We're following a  down the aisle
She stops at a row and leans over to hand a glass of tomato juice to the Person in the Window Seat
Here you are, Sir
Mr
Brooks who now looks like the Man in the picture on the third Driver's license, accepts the drink
Thank you
He takes a sip and resumes his gaze out the window
(almost inaudible whisper) God grant me the Serenity to accept the things  cannot change, Courage to change the things  can, and Wisdom to know the difference
The earth that he is looking at below is a long way away
Come off a sign which reads:   - 2 1/2 miles to an Alamo rental car traveling south on the El Camino Real
In his Pottery-Throwing clothes, Mr
Brooks is behind the wheel
There's an Ace Hardware Store bag sitting upright and open on the passenger seat
We peek over the edge of the bag
brand new hatchet with a gleaming blade sits at the bottom
Mr
Brooks adjusts the rearview mirror
Marshall is on the passenger side of the back seat
You're awfully quiet back there
() 89
: Without any indication he's been addressed, Marshall continues to stare stoically ahead
- The Alamo Rental car carrying Mr
Brooks continues on
It's dark
There's barely enough ambient light to see that we are close on the knob of the Front Door
From outside we hear the muffled sound of a Black & Decker cordless drill and the knob begins to vibrate
Someone is drilling the lock
The sound stops
The knob turns
The door opens
flashlight is shone into our face
(
) Mr
Alvin Griffin, this is the Chicago Police
From the protection of the doorjamb, a very young is the person shining the flashlight into the house
He's flanked on either side of the door by Detective Atwood and Detective Snyder
The Officer's flashlight illuminates a short  with a immediately off to the left and the   fading into darkness, straight ahead
(continues) We have a warrant to search your home and premises
We're coming in
Flashlight in her left hand and the Glock in her right, Detective Atwood is the first one across the threshold
She directs the beam at the wall next to the door; finds the light switch
Click
Click
Click
Lights don't work
() 90
: She continues to the Hall
The darkness is so oppressive there, it seems that her stream of light must struggle to pierce it
The Room at the end is the
With Snyder hanging in the Entryway to protect her back, Atwood eases the hand with the flashlight around the corner
The dishwasher, the sink, the cabinets gleam dully back at her
She steps inside
debris field of empty pharmaceutical boxes and vials trails away from the Refrigerator
Her flashlight sweeps the rest of the Room
Beyond an open countertop in the  , the light blurs past an oval of white, and then comes back
It's the face of a
Careful of the litter, Atwood moves forward until she can see that the Woman is sitting in a chair at the far end of the dining table
Her throat has been cut
Her head is being held upright by her hair which is taped to the back of the chair
She has a pen taped between her fingers, but the Appointment Book in front of her is drenched in blood
(calls to the darkness in back of her) We have a dead woman in here
light and footsteps hurry toward her from the
Atwood swings her light at them
Hey
He squints and turns away
thought you were behind me
The living room is clean
() 91
: (2) Atwood swings her light back onto the dead Woman
The combined illumination of the flashlights cause the support joists twelve feet up to throw eerie shadows onto the open ceiling
Snyder, meet Mona
The Uniformed Policeman comes up beside Atwood
called it in
The smell of blood and the sight of the carnage is too much for him
His gorge rises and he gags
Do that outside
The Officer doesn't have to be told twice
(to Snyder, re: the body) Meeks did this
thought Meeks hung people
Atwood retraces her steps in the Kitchen
Meeks is a steroid freak
This Refrigerator was always full of steroids
Mona was Alvin Griffin's niece, receptionist, lover and keeper of the keys
She focuses her flashlight on an open padlock dangling from a steel band that runs around the Refrigerator
With the barrel of the Glock she opens the door
The only edibles inside are a tomato, half a loaf of bread, a package of hotdogs and some part of a chicken in a  box
The rest of the space is vacant
Well, the steroids are certainly gone
You think Meeks has Alvin with him
() 92
: (3) Meeks thinks Alvin turned him in
She shuts the Refrigerator
Let's go see what's in the rest of the house
: Atwood and her flashlight pass us
Three feet to her right and slightly behind is Snyder and his flashlight
The two Detectives are leaving the Living Room and entering the  toward the bedrooms
The ceiling is low here and it feels very claustrophobic
Ahead is a Door painted red
But before they get to it, there's a Room on the right
Snyder shines his light in
It's a
The shower curtain is open
Nobody in the tub
The Door ahead is waiting, but there's another Door on the right
Snyder shines his light in
This one is a Treatment Room with a Therapy table and shelves of oils and unguents
They've come to the red Door
Atwood will open this one
She turns the knob and pushes
The Door is stuck
She and Snyder exchange a look
Snyder shuffles back half a step and flattens himself against the wall
He shuts off his flashlight
Atwood takes a deep breath, levers her weight against the door and pushes
There's a sudden Snap
Then the door swings freely open
The beam of Atwood's flashlight reveals a large room containing a bed, a dresser, a
The sound is coming from up in the rafters
Atwood whips her flashlight in that direction
For an instant the beam catches a piece of a large shape falling fast right at her
() 93
: (4) Then it's lost in the darkness and then picked up again in the reflected light in the Hall
The shape is a naked Man
The Man nails Atwood in the shoulder
Her gun goes off
She bounces into the wall and onto her ass
Barely slowed the Man continues in an upward arc
His feet and knees slam into the ceiling
Plaster dust rains
The Man swings back, past Snyder
He's lost in the darkness again
Then he swings back into the light and comes to a stop just inside the bedroom Door
The Man is hanging from a rope around his neck
He's dead
His Body is festooned with syringes stuck into his bare flesh
In fact two of the needles hold a sheet of paper to the Man's chest
Printed on the paper in big black letters are the words: (getting to her feet) Snyder, this is Alvin Griffin
The gray of dawn is in the sky
' Mr
Brooks, wearing a disguise that makes him look like the picture on the Driver's license in the first plastic sleeve, gets into a Taxi
-  - The Cab drops Mr
Brooks off in front of a house
Mr
Brooks watches the Cab drive away and then with his Carry-On bag starts walking in the opposite direction
He turns a corner
-  - Still on foot, Mr
Brooks arrives at his non-descript Toyota
There are also neighborhood cars parked along the street
Mr
Brooks unlocks his car and throws his Carry-On onto the passenger seat
94
- Mr
Brooks' Toyota speeds up an on-ramp and joins the light traffic
- From the back seat Marshall watches Mr
Brooks remove the pieces of his disguise - a wig, a mustache, glasses, and drop them in the Carry-On
How do you feel
Dirty
That's understandable
You've never killed for this reason before
The feeling will go away
don't think so
It's the whole thing, Marshall
If  could find a way to just disappear, where there was absolutely no trace of me; because eventually  will get caught doing this
And it'll be very embarrassing for me and Emma and Jane
So 've been thinking
is there a way that Mr
Smith could kill me and make me disappear
Number one, Mr
Smith is not smart enough to do that
Number two, there is no reason, if you're careful, to believe you will ever get caught
know  will have to plan it for Mr
Smith, but  think that's what want to do
'm not particularly fond of that plan, Earl
Remember if you die, go with you and  like being alive
like eating,  like fucking, like killing
() 95
: have to end it, Marshall
One way or the other
And  think this is the best way
Well fuck you then
Long ago this was a nice area
banner hangs from an old Deco building -
Mr
Brooks is walking through the Parking Lot beside the Building
There, as a first car in a double space is the old green Pontiac convertible
It's blocked in by another car
Mr
Brooks sidles between the cars to check the license plate against the one in his memory
It's the car Thorton Meeks was in, outside the Drug Store
Mr
Brooks walks away
- Mr
Brooks opens the kiln door and removes three pieces embellished with a beautiful yellow glaze
He sets them on a table then takes his Carry-On bag and places it in a ceramic trough which he puts into the kiln
The door is shut
Flame erupts from the gas jets
-   - The Bathroom door opens
Mr
Brooks, in his pajamas, turns out the light and crosses to the bed
Emma looks up as he pulls back the covers and gets in
You worked all night
had ideas for pots that took too long and the clay kept winning
(he kisses her) 'll be fine
() () 96
: (') And there's a yellow Chinese glaze 'm trying to get right
He lays his head on the pillow and is almost instantly asleep
'  - Reflected in the glass of an open mirrored closet door is a tastefully furnished  with floor-to-ceiling windows that look out at   from the 20th floor
An empty suitcase falls into this picture and bounces on the carpet
Behind the mirrored door, Detective Atwood is atop a stepstool rummaging through the suitcases on the highest shelf
Throughout the Condo there is an incessant ringing of the phones
Another suitcase goes down and Atwood finds what she's looking for - a framed color 8 x 10 photo of her husband, Jesse
He's in a business suit and holding some kind of trophy
The phones stop ringing
Atwood comes down the stepstool, folds it and is carrying it back to where it lives when the phones start ringing again
She picks up a cordless in the Den
Yes
The Asian Attorney interrupts her sip of coffee
Hi Tracy, this is Nancy Tang
We received a counter offer
Are you sitting down
-  ' Yeah, go ahead
He can't get that, can he
with Nancy
() 97
: ( ) No, my sense of it is by asking for five, they're hoping you'll settle anywhere between two five and three
Never
How long can you stall them
They know you want this done quickly, so they're going to expect a quick counter offer
need two days
Wait two days before getting back to them
If they call, tell them it's a big number, 'm thinking about it
Okay
And the picture he wanted
She slams the frame of Jesse's photo against the inside of a metal trash can
Nancy winces and then smiles at the sound of shattering glass
Atwood plucks the photo out of the frame and tears it so that the rip can be heard over the phone
tell him  couldn't find it
- Mr
Brooks is still asleep
Emma, dressed for the day, arrives at his side of the bed
She rubs the back of Mr
Brooks' hand
Earl
Earl
Mr
Brooks opens his eyes
(sleepy, groggy) Huh
() 98
: Roger is on the phone
- In his slippers and robe, Mr
Brooks is standing in the Doorway watching Jane who is leaning over the Counter with an open Newspaper next to a bowl of cereal
He has a chance to take a good long look before she feels his presence and raises her head
Oh, Hi, Daddy,  thought you'd already be gone
Roger called
There was another murder last night near Stanford
Oh
Done the same way as the one they talked to you about
Right down to the hatchet being left at the scene
Jane can't quite conceal the tremor of surprise that ripples through her and Mr
Brooks sees it
They think they have a serial killer
Obviously you were here last night, so you're in the clear
That's good news, isn't it
mean even if you're innocent it's good news to know you're not a suspect
Oh, yeah
How's the morning sickness
Do you want to ride in with me today
feel fine, but  don't know how long that will last
Mr
Brooks nods, turns to leave, then turns back
() 99
: Do you love me, Jane
Of course  love you, daddy, you're my father
Have you decided whether or not to keep the baby
Not yet
(nods) Okay
' Looking off the grill as it overtakes another car in the Fastlane
Eminem is on the stereo
The car ahead moves out of the way

Smith is rapping along to "Cleanin' Out My Closet"
He knows all the words
With Eminem fading, we fall behind Mr
Smith
One car, two cars
The third car is Detective Atwood's car
' Atwood is driving
Snyder is in the passenger seat
What are we doing
'Are we there yet
' , are we there yet
' , you sound like a child
We're playing a hunch
We've been following this guy all day, he's boring, and everything we run on him comes up clean
() 100
: If it didn't, it wouldn't be called a hunch
Meeks' finger-prints were all over the chiropractor, the note, refrigerator, he's the guy we should be looking for
Look where
Please tell me
Everyone knows who Meeks is and is looking for him
The chiropractor was the last link to his old life that  know of
The only way we'll find him, now, is if someone turns him in or we trip over him at a bus stop
On the other hand, Detective Snyder, no one knows who the Thumbprint Killer is or where he is
However,  have a fucking hunch this guy Baffert does
have two days to play that hunch
If you feel like you're wasting your time with me, 'd be happy to do it alone
He looks at her and shakes his head
had a fight with my wife this morning; what's your problem
My husband wants five million dollars
Mr
Smith's car enters the Parking Lot of a Rib Joint
Atwood's car stops across the street
' Atwood and Snyder watch Mr
Smith enter the Restaurant
They wait in silence
muted 'tone' announces the arrival of an Email on their computer
Snyder reads and frowns
Bad news
() 101
: Lister is pulling you off this case
Why
Maybe they caught him
She twists the screen around so she can read the message
No
She would have said that
Snyder points across the street at Mr
Smith coming out of the Restaurant carrying a Take-Out bag
You want to keep following him
Atwood hesitates
Lister only said you were off the case, not me
(smiles) Good thinking, Tonto
She starts the car
There's the muted 'tone' again
Atwood looks at the computer screen
Shit
She just 86'ed you too
Trailed by Snyder, Detective Atwood arrives at Captain Lister's
Is she in
She's with someone
Good
() 102
: Atwood blows past the Secretary and opens the door to Lister's office
' There are two  in suits on the other side of the desk from the Captain
Atwood ignores them and focuses on Lister
You promised if  settled my divorce  had three days on the Thumbprint Killer
have the rest of today and tomorrow left
Detective Atwood, meet  Agents Longnecker and Campbell, they're taking over your investigation
You promised you would keep them out of it for three days
They won't allow me to keep that promise
Atwood glares at her then at the  Men
This is my case, what you're doing is fucked
But since  can't stop you, and she won't, here's a tip
James Baffert, you should stake him out, he knows something
We have some other ideas we are looking into
Then what's the problem
You do that and 'll tail Baffert
Thank you for all your good work, Detective
This is our case now
Atwood looks from one Man to the Other
() 103
: Good luck
(to Captain Lister) Later  suppose you'll fill me in on what 'm supposed to be doing around here
'm confused
She leaves
Snyder closes the door behind her
-    - It's deserted with only a small spill of light coming from Mr
Brooks' Office
Mr
Brooks is at his desk
The lamp at his elbow throws a yellow cone across his face
His head is in his hands, he's been crying
Marshall steps out of the shadows behind him
It's time to go
Yeah
He reaches into a bottom drawer and as he takes out an envelope, Marshall reads the tear-stained hand written letter resting on the blotter
Dear Emma and Jane, my loves, have a terminal illness and instead of subjecting you to my deterioration,  have decided to disappear
Don't try to find me, don't want to be found
Please believe that the time  spent with you brought me the greatest joy of my life
Love
Dad
Mr
Brooks picks up the letter and folds it
So you're going to go through with it
Mr
Brooks stuffs the letter in the envelope, seals it and picks up a pen
() 104
: It's all planned to work out, Marshall
On the envelope he writes: For  and
On the sidewalk Mr
Smith is walking toward the on-coming traffic
The headlights make it difficult to tell one car from the other until they pass
That doesn't keep him from looking for Mr
Brooks
The houses stop and he's passing a pocket park
In a dark space between the street lamps, a hand falls on Mr
Smith's shoulder
He jumps and a scream squeaks out of his throat
It's Mr
Brooks, in his Pottery-Throwing clothes
(smiles) Are you ready to rock and roll, Mr
Smith
Mr
Smith swallows hard and nods
Mr
Brooks propels him into the park
' Mr
Brooks is driving
Mr
Smith is in the passenger seat
Both are lost in a wary silence
Abruptly from the back seat: smell gun oil, a gun oil that's different than yours
He brought his gun
After he gets what he wants he plans to kill me
Ah
now  get it
You were counting on that, weren't you
It has a certain logic
But if your plan is to have him kill you, why do you have to kill someone else first
() 105
: He'll need to see that to get up the courage to kill me
Marshall roars with laughter
Not even you believe that, Earl
It makes it more exciting, doesn't it, to think he's going to kill you after you kill someone else
You're getting your rocks off big time, that's why you're doing it
Not true
and if it were, so what
(to Mr
Smith) You're goddamn great, you know
To have the balls to do this
'm pretty nervous but that's normal right
Perfectly normal
' Atwood is propped up in bed reading a Magazine
Her hair is pulled back and her face glistens with Cold Cream
The phone rings
Should she answer it
It rings again, then again
Reluctantly she grabs the receiver
Hello
Oh, yes, yes
(she sits up) Put him through
Hi, this is Detective Atwood speaking, thanks for calling
Yes, your roommate said you were in Tokyo
Anything, if you saw anything at all it might be helpful
in a Flight Attendant's uniform is standing at the window of the Apartment he shares with the Stewardess
() 106
: cordless phone to his ear, he is looking down at the House where the dance Couple was murdered
The weird thing is that they closed their curtains, at first they were open like they always were and they were making love, which they always did, and then when  looked again the curtains were closed, and there were what looked like camera flashes coming from behind the curtains
with Detective Atwood
Camera flashes
That's what it looked like
(almost to herself) That's why he poses them
'm sorry
Nothing
wish  could be more helpful, didn't see the killer or anything like that, but since it was weird thought  should call
You've been very helpful
This answers a lot of questions for me
Thank you very much, Mr
Struber
She's about to hang up when Struber speaks again
The guy you should talk to is the guy on the floor below us
() () 107
: (2) (') eh,  can't remember his name, but he told me once that he'd taken some great pictures of that Couple making love, he's the one you should speak to
Would that be, Mr
Baffert
Yeah,  think Jim or James
Thank you very much
Atwood disconnects then quickly dials
Snyder, meet me at Baffert's apartment with a Search Warrant
Listen to me, this is what you tell the judge
Coming up the back  we arrive at a  and make a right
In front of us is Mr
Smith watching Mr
Brooks pick the deadbolt in the Service door
Mr
Brooks straightens up, twists the handle and pushes the door inward
It's caught by a chain
He takes the bent rubber- tipped forceps from one pocket, from another he hands Mr
Smith a pair of latex gloves
Put these on
In the middle of the large darkened , Mr
Brooks pauses to listen to the sounds of the Apartment
The gun with the silencer is already in his right hand
Both are encased in a Ziplock bag
Beside him, Mr
Smith is wide eyed with fear and anticipation
His teeth are even chattering
Try a couple deep breaths through your nose
() 108
: have to take a crap so bad
This won't take long
Mr
Brooks and Mr
Smith come out of the Kitchen
The is quite well appointed
There's a fire going in the Fireplace
The sound of a
is coming from a  off a  up ahead
That is where Mr
Brooks and Mr
Smith are headed
They're more than half way across the   when
, the doorbell rings
Mr
Smith gasps and looks beseechingly at Mr
Brooks
Without an ounce of hurry, Mr
Brooks maneuvers him back into the shadows of the
The doorbell rings again
wet spot appears in Mr
Smith's crotch and runs down his pant leg
Pee drips onto the linoleum
Man comes out of the Hallway
The Living Room light goes on
The Man is Jesse, Detective Atwood's estranged husband
He opens the Front Door
The Woman who comes in is Sheila, his divorce lawyer
They kiss, tongues
His hands brush over her breasts
He begins to unbutton her blouse
The kiss breaks
As he continues unbuttoning
called your wife's lawyer
They're thinking about the five million dollars
Jesse opens the blouse and looks at the breasts under the bra
Realistically how much do you think we can get
Sheila gives him a quick kiss and moves on into the where she drops her briefcase on the couch
() 109
: (2) If we go to court, best case, two, if she wants to settle, best case, three, but  would be happy with two seven
Backlit by the Fireplace, Jesse kisses her again
From the , Mr
Brooks and Mr
Smith watch Jesse unzip Sheila's slacks and dropping to his knees peel them off her legs
She steps out of them
He kisses the inside of her thighs, her crotch, then standing up: 'll be right back
On his way out of the  : think we should hold firm for three
He shuts off the light
In the glow of the Fireplace, Sheila removes her jacket
Let's not be piggish, two five, two seven, would be a good deal
The
goes silent
Jesse returns with a partially full glass of Champagne
He hands Sheila a glass from a side table, takes a bottle out of an ice bucket and as he fills her glass: (teasing) You've already had half a bottle
You're late; if we want it, there's more
They clink glasses
To us
To three million dollars
() 110
: (3) (after a sip) We have to do this fast because remember, Marie is meeting us here
We could ask her to join us
Not funny
(undoing the front of her bra) wasn't trying to be
She bops him playfully
He bends and slips a nipple into his mouth
Sheila bites her lip and moans
In the , Mr
Smith shifts around for a better view
The floor under him
In the  , both Sheila and Jesse react to the sound
Are we alone
Yeah
Mr
Brooks seems to appear magically out of the darkened Kitchen with his gun raised
He's followed by Mr
Smith
Sheila opens her mouth to scream
Don't do that
' Detective Atwood hurries down the  and out of breath, stops in front of Mr
Smith's door
She raps sharply
Waits a bare three seconds and raps again
Mr
Baffert
Mr
Baffert
The door of the Apartment behind her opens and an sticks her head out
He's gone
() 111
: Atwood shows her badge
Do you have any idea when he'll be back
He skipped out
heard him leave this evening and a few minutes later there were Movers here
Musta been behind on the rent
He didn't even say good-bye
Thank you
As the Old Lady watches, Atwood tries the knob
It's unlocked
She pushes the door open
The  and   she can see are completely empty
Furniture,
, camera equipment, art, gone
told you
' On her way in, Atwood draws her gun
Keeping close to the walls she audits the
All the Cabinet doors are open
Dishes, pots and pans, cutlery, gone
She moves on to the
Soap, shampoo, toilet paper, toothpaste, toothbrushes, towels, washcloths, the contents of the Medicine Cabinet, gone
She moves on to the
Bed, night table, lamps,
, computer, gone
Clothes closets, empty of everything
She looks around
Mr
Smith's entire Apartment has been stripped absolutely clean, except
there's a crumpled piece of paper in the far corner of the Bedroom
Atwood goes over and gets down on one knee
With her fingers pulling at the corners she is able to straighten the paper enough to make out that it's a work order from a Moving company
() 112
: Reading it with the paper pinched between thumb and forefinger of her left hand, Atwood rises
There's the silhouette of a Man in the doorway behind her
Obviously Baffert's gone
Atwood whirls, gun up
She sees that it's Snyder
(overlapping) Goddamit, Snyder
Knock
wasn't able to get the search warrant
We may have gotten lucky
(holding up the paper) This is the Moving Company's work order and
(points)) it looks like this is the address where they're taking Baffert's stuff
Where were you when you called me
At home in bed
Can you prove that
was home in bed, why should have to prove that
Your husband Jesse and his lawyer were killed tonight
Atwood slowly lowers her head and fixes her eyes on the floor in stunned silence
It looks like the Thumbprint Killer, 've been ordered to bring you in for questioning
() 113
: (2) Why,  didn't want Jesse dead, loved him,  hated what he was doing to me
It's on record you said you'd like him dead and who better to fake a Thumbprint killing than you
You can't actually believe  would do that
If our jobs have taught us anything, Tracy, is that people do strange things
They just want to ask you some questions
will be happy to answer any questions after we check out this address
Atwood goes to leave the room
Snyder blocks her way
have to take you in, Tracy
(waves the paper) This is the answer to the Thumbprint Killer, Snyder, and this is where 'm going and you're not going to stop me
Don't make me cuff you, Tracy, because  will if  have to
Atwood smiles winningly
believe you would
(smiles back) You can count on it
() 114
: (3) Snyder never sees it coming
Atwood's right cross nails him exactly where the jaw meets the neck and down he goes on his ass
(standing over him) It would be nice if you could come with me, but if you do and it goes bad, they'll burn your ass
So this never happened
Mr
Brooks' car speeds under an overpass
' That was great
It was fantastic
It was everything  hoped it would be
Thank you
You're welcome
In the back seat: Here comes the gun
Without taking his eyes off the road
Yup
Mr
Smith slides a pistol from under his jacket and points it at Mr
Brooks
(feigns surprise) What are you doing
You're smart enough to figure that out, Mr
Brooks
Well we're going sixty five miles an hour, Mr
Smith, if you shoot me now, there's a good chance we'll both die
() 115
: Not now
Take the next off ramp
That wouldn't be very smart of me would it
He accelerates around a truck into the Fastlane
Mr
Smith can see the Exit coming up, it's quickly left behind
(matter of fact) Think about this
You pissed yourself back there, you left your at the scene of a double homicide, and there's nothing to indicate that  was ever there
If the Cops do an analysis of that urine, and they will, you're the Thumbprint Killer
(smug) No
still have pictures of you doing the first murder
Mr
Brooks smiles a knowing smile
Beyond him on the other side of the Divider, cars are zipping by in the opposite direction
Yes
But what were you doing at the second murder
Mr
Smith doesn't have an answer for that
Let me help you with a thought
You say  forced you to come along and if 'm not here or more specifically my body is not here to say different, you might have a chance to beat the rap
Now you're probably asking yourself why would help you
'm tired, Mr
Smith, 'm tired of killing
But 'm an addict,  can't quit
've tried
can't do it on my own
So 'll let you kill me but  want you to do it smart, in a way that disappear and my family never knows what  was
() 116
: (2) How do  do that
There's a cemetery  know about
We find an open grave, you shoot me, fall in the grave, you shovel in just enough earth to cover me, tomorrow a casket is lowered onto me and 've disappeared
It's a good plan
What do you say
Why should  trust you
You don't have to trust me
You're the man holding the gun, you saw me put mine in the trunk
don't know
You really want me to kill you
Yes
Okay
But any sudden moves and you're dead on the spot and 'll make sure your family knows what you are
understand
Come off the banner hanging across the front - , to find Atwood walking away from her car
(to herself, regarding the Building) You've come down in the world, Mr
Baffert
- High ceilings, once grand, now blue neon and a cage around the Front Desk to protect the Night Clerk who is nowhere in sight
Somewhere a radio is playing salsa music loud
() 117
: Atwood crosses to the elevator
She pushes the call button
With an arthritic rattle the door opens
Atwood selects the 5th Floor
Creek
, Clatter
, Clank
, the door closes and after a stuttering liftoff the car begins its ascent
The overhead light flickers on and off
Atwood looks up at it
Mr
Brooks leads Mr
Smith across a street to a pedestrian gate set in a high wall
Through the bars of the gate we can see a Cemetery bathed in moonlight
Mr
Brooks reaches into his pocket
Mr
Smith tightens his grip on the gun
Uh uh, take your hand out real slow
Mr
Brooks does as he's told
key dangles from his fingers
It's locked
You don't want to climb over, do you
What are you doing with a key to a cemetery
own it
Why do you own a cemetery
Mr
Brooks unlocks the gate and preceding Mr
Smith, goes inside
You always want to invest in things people can't do without
Water and cemeteries are pretty safe
He locks the gate and handing the key to Mr
Smith: () 118
: You'll need this to get out
Now there should be an open grave around here somewhere
Let's see if we can find it
He produces a small flashlight from his pocket and off they go
Repeating their arthritic performance the elevator doors open
Atwood steps out into a wide sporadically lit
Peering at the numbers Atwood goes to her Left
In the middle of the Hall behind her a Couple exits a Room and drifts to the other side of the Hall on their way to the elevator
Atwood re-checks the number on the Moving Company's Work Order - 517, she's going the wrong way
She turns around
Now Atwood and the Couple are walking toward each other on opposite sides of the Hall
Atwood steps into an area of light
The reflection off her face catches the attention of the Man who is wearing a wide brimmed hat
He lifts his head
It's Thorton Meeks
The Woman with him was the Driver of the Van
She's wearing a watchcap
Meeks gently takes his Companion's arm
They stop
Her eyes go to where he's looking and then back to his
At some unspoken signal they both draw their guns
Intent on finding 517 and Baffert, the Couple hasn't registered on Atwood's radar
chunk of plaster blows off the wall next to her head
Startled, Atwood winces away
The Woman fires
The slug explodes the plaster on the other side of Atwood's head
Now Atwood is turning toward them, gun in hand
Meeks fires
The bullet passes through Atwood's jacket
() 119
: Instinctively Atwood assumes a classic duelist's pose offering the smallest target possible
Calmly she squeezes off her first shot
The plaster explodes from the wall above Meeks' head
The Woman fires
hole appears in Atwood's sleeve
Atwood pulls the trigger again
The Woman screams and falls back into Meeks, a bullet in her hip
Atwood's third shot takes the hat off Meeks head
She now realizes who her attackers are
Meeks
Dragging the Woman in the direction of the stairs,
Meeks fires
Maybe it's his broken trigger finger that affects his aim
The shots miss
The Woman fires
Atwood's next two shots miss
Meeks and the Woman arrive at the stairs and before rounding the corner,
, fire at Atwood who is now moving deliberately at them
Atwood doesn't try and dodge the bullets or flinch away from them and her shots are unhurried
The next one catches the Woman in the side
The one after that nails Meeks in the left shoulder
He's spun into the Woman
- Leaning on each other Meeks and the Woman lurch down the worn marble steps
- Atwood reaches the stairs and cheats a look around the corner
From the landing below, Meeks and the Woman fire
Atwood steps out from behind the wall and shoulders square, shoots
Another sidestep
This shot shatters Meeks' knee
He bellows in pain
() 120
: Moving to the side again, Atwood shoots
But Meeks' knee has collapsed and he and the Woman are already tumbling down the next set of steps
Atwood waits
There's silence, then the murmur of voices
(calls out) Atwood
Yeah
Come on down, there's something want to show you
- Gun at the ready, Atwood edges her way downward
At about the tenth step she is able to lean over and look through the banisters
Meeks and the Woman are propping themselves up against the wall on the  below
Both of them still have their guns
The moment Meeks' eyes meet Atwood's, he puts his gun to the Woman heads
Atwood sucks in her breath
Meeks puts the gun to his temple
Atwood clasps a hand to her mouth and exhales in ragged gulps
The finger of light from Mr
Brooks' handtorch discovers a freshly dug
There we are
Now if  stand here
He positions himself at one end of the Grave
and you stand there, not too far away and you shoot me,  should fall straight back into the hole
() 121
: You don't think  have the guts to do this do you
'm hoping you do
Mr
Brooks shuts off his light and straightens up
Okay, let's get this over with
Mr
Smith raises his gun and points it at Mr
Brooks's head
He hesitates
'll close my eyes
He does
Mr
Smith pulls the trigger
Click
Mr
Smith looks in horror at the malfunctioning gun
Mr
Brooks opens his eyes
Mr
Smith aims the gun again
Click
Click
'm sorry
As he talks he counters around until Mr
Smith is the one with his back to the open Grave
really did want you to kill me
But in case at the last minute changed my mind,  returned to your apartment and bent the firing pin on your gun
He wrenches the shovel out of a mound of waiting earth
Mr
Smith tries to fire the gun at Mr
Brooks again
In fact  even brought another gun for you so you could finish me if had decided to go through with it
He opens his jacket and shows Mr
Smith the gun
() 122
: (2) Unfortunately for you, my daughter is pregnant and just before you pulled the trigger,  realized how much  want to see the end to that story
(dry mouth) If you do anything to me, if you touch one hair on my head, the Police will find the pictures of you killing that Couple
The contents of your safety deposit box, Mr
Smith, have vanished
Without warning, Mr
Brooks swings the shovel
The force of the blow breaks Mr
Smith's left arm
He howls
The next blow comes almost immediately
It smashes into the left side of Mr
Smith's head
The screams stop and a misfiring set of neurons causes Mr
Smith to stand up straight and wobbling, look directly at Mr
Brooks
The blood streaming down his face is black in the moonlight
Mr
Brooks takes a step to the side, cocks his wrists and swings again
His full weight is behind this one
The blade of the shovel strikes Mr
Smith in the throat very nearly taking off his head
The flesh that was once Mr
Smith falls to the ground
(looking down at the corpse) Before  was the Thumbprint Killer, Mr
Smith,  killed a lot of people in a lot of different ways
Looking up
Mr
Smith's body is rolled over the edge
It falls on top of us
123
Mr
Brooks takes a shovel of dirt from the pile and whistling 'By The Light Of The Silvery Moon', begins the task of covering Mr
Smith
Newspaper is lying unfolded on the Counter next to the remnants of a breakfast
The headline reads - - Under that headline is a large picture of Mr
Smith aka Mr
Baffert
In the lower right corner is another headline to a story - Murder Suicide For The Hangman -
The reader of the paper is Mr
Brooks
On a stool next to him, Marshall is also reading
It says here the Thumbprint Killer is a monster
annoys you a little bit that you can't take credit, doesn't it
Anyone who is good at what they do, wants recognition
But since 'm not going to do it anymore, 'll let Mr
Smith take the credit
Don't kid yourself, Earl, you're going to kill again
No, 'm not
'll continue the meetings and 'll control it
On the other stool next to Mr
Brooks is a
Her large purse hangs open from the back of the stool; the cel phone clearly visible inside
Mr
Brooks looks at the phone
But there is an answer  would like to have
124
Detective Atwood is seated in her  reading the same front page Mr
Brooks was reading
stops in the door
Good work, Atwood
Thanks, Tom
He moves on
From off screen: You should ask the  to kiss your ass and buy you a Cadillac
like my ass too much for that
Snyder comes in and holds up the Work Order from the Moving Company
This is bogus
The company doesn't exist in the city, the state, the United States or Canada
So the whole point of this piece of paper was to give me Meeks
That's what it looks like
Why
Who moved him, where did they move him to, and why did he give me Meeks
That's what we get paid to find out
Atwood picks up the Newspaper
'm going to go to the bathroom and think about this
She stands
The phone rings
She answers it
() 125
: Detective Atwood
Looking out at the city, Mr
Brooks speaks into the cel phone he stole from the Woman
Why are you a cop
with Atwood
Who is this
You're rich, you have a good education, you could have gone into your father's business, instead you went outside all of that and became successful on your own
Why
You want something from me if you don't tell me who you are 'm going to hang up
Did you think your husband's killing was random and  certainly didn't have to give you Meeks
Mr
Baffert
Snyder perks up
She points for him to get on the other line
What's the answer
You don't sound like you
have a little cold
Are you going to give me the answer
Where are you
() 126
: 'll tell you if you can give me the true answer to my question
Detective Atwood weighs her options and decides to go for it
My father was very disappointed was born a girl and he let me know that
've spent my whole life trying to prove him wrong
Thank you
Wait
You promised to tell me where you are
Me
'm on top of a building
Atwood and Snyder hear the click as Mr
Brooks hangs up
Why would he be interested in that
At the Parking structure, Mr
Brooks holds the phone over the edge and drops it
We follow the phone down, down, down, until it hits the pavement and disintegrates
Everything is as it was
- It's dark
In his robe and pajamas, Mr
Brooks is standing in front of the open refrigerator gazing blankly at the contents with a glass of milk in one hand
There's nothing he wants in here
He closes the door
- Carrying the glass of milk, Mr
Brooks passes Jane's
The door is ajar
He stops, backs up and looks
His Daughter's asleep
127
'  - Mr
Brooks walks to the bed and leans over to give her a kiss on the cheek
His lips have just brushed her flesh when she twists violently under him and stabs upward with a pair of scissors
The blades are driven deep into his throat
Mr
Brooks jerks back, the milk flies out of his hand
Agghhh
Agghhh
He grabs at the handle of the scissors, but his blood makes them too slippery
He can't pull them out
(
) Honey, Earl, Earl
- Mr
Brooks is tossing in his sleep next to Emma
She has a hold of his arm
Wake up, wake up
On the pillow Mr
Brooks' eyes fly open
You were having a nightmare
(breathing hard) Oh
woke you up
It's okay
She kisses him on the forehead
(') 'm here, go back to sleep, 'm here
Taking his hand, she lies back down
After a moment Mr
Brooks turns over on his side and looks directly at us
His lips begin to move but we can't hear what he's saying, so we move in on his face
It's not until it fills our view that we can hear the words
() 128
: that  may be reasonably happy in this life, And supremely happy with Him forever in the next
Amen
God grant me the Serenity to accept
