The breaks occurred a lifetime ago, healed uneven

And all  have left is the will to remember
reach into a dresser drawer, pull out a yellowed black & white picture of : this beatific blonde, sleeping

Slide  over the Matriarch's picture: the Matriarch 30 years younger now

The names are dead or too guilty to tell
The events so brutal they beg to be re-told

And there  am: next to the `Ring' Magazine Reporter chewing the ass out of his cigar

partner  never asked for
The scowl meant to hide a shit-scared kid who'd been teaching evidence classes three months ago
His Old-Man was an lifer who never got past Sergeant
We should make our move now
Mid-fight
Look at the crowd: you wanna be at the center of a riot
don't wanna be here when Noonan and the Feds show up
point at the bantam Black: We let Sanderline finish this beating, we get his gratitude
* Junior eyes the exits clockwise, nervous, waiting for `Untouchables' to break the doors down
hate the way panic smells when  stand this close to it
We gonna let Rock-a-bye fight too- -relax Junior

-                                3 The Bantam Black:
Led through the double doors
He sees me, then his gaze shifts to Junior popping jabs inches from  : a muscled middle-weight, fight- taped hands cuffed behind his back
smile big: Sanderline, 'm Lieutenant Klein of the  and a real big fan- -you're under arrest
Sanderline spooks, steps back
Turn and make sure Junior sees the fire in my eyes, keep staring at Junior as  speak to Sanderline again: 3
No you're not
Reuben is- -Lieutenant Dave why you arrest- -for being a ranked fighter who still steals hubcaps
Shut up
(off Ruiz, back to Sanderline) If  was gonna arrest you, wouldn't have let you finish: and that hook-uppercut combo you got is something special
(from Reuben, beat) Reuben's in custody
But you could be our Guest
Whaddya say

Behind the stands
Reuben and Sanderline in street clothes, hats pulled down tight
Feature the Announcer: Ladies and Gentleman
due to circumstances beyond our control, Rock--Bye Ruiz will not fight this- - drown the
Beer and lit cigars shell the Announcer
Fights erupt in the stands

Three exits down: day late-dollar short Feds

Sanderline digs the digs: sports the Ambassador robe over his street clothes, reading the Bible
If they got shrimp
(into the phone) Shrimp cocktail
(over to Reuben) You want something Reuben
To know why the fuck 'm here- -mind your tone, Shitbird
Shitbird went out with Vaudeville
You get your badge in a cereal box
You're here because we want you to remember where you live

Excellent Sanderline
What
You live in , Asshole
You do not live in `Federal Government
' Ruiz turns `caught-me' pink
nod to Junior: split `em
Playing adjoining hotel rooms like sweat boxes
We get to spend time alone now
Want some perfume
Junior shoves Ruiz through the inner-door connecting the rooms
Sanderline giggles
Close the door behind them
Sit down inches from Sanderline, change my tone: Stop laughing
Instant quiet
(') What were you gonna tell Welles Noonan
(watch as he flinches) He has a subpoena with your name on it, Sanderline
Why would someone like you need to talk to the
Attorney
Sanderline staying silent
(') You're a legbreaker for the Mob know the Men that pay you for that will murder you if they hear you're about to talk to the
- -but they don't know
6
(beat, small smile) And they don't have to
Now tell me what you were gonna tell Noonan- -phone rings
Sanderline flinches for the second time
Bet you they ran outta shrimp

Now
See, we think the Spade might testify that Sam owns him and how we was grooming him for a title shot he was gonna tank fight everybody woulda' got flush off of, including the Spade

Click
breath
Drop the phone on the cradle
step to the window
open it
then  chuckle genuine: Sanderline, you gotta see this
Trusting puppy Sanderline steps to the window: What'm - -smash his head against the frame using his forward motion
He loses muscle control for the split-second it takes me to pitch his legs up and out
My face a quick-change evil mask
Feature Sanderline's nine-story fall
That Ambassador Hotel robe billows behind him like a cape
He detonates an overhead streetlight with a bomb sound, then hits the driveway
Unzip my fly, hustle into the bathroom, screams from outside now
Flush the toilet as Junior and Ruiz pile through the door
Step out, play it baffled: look at the bed where Sanderline sat, then the open window, screams floating up
Lunge to the window: Sanderline post-mortem
Head shattered
Valets sprinting
Junior on the phone
Ruiz steps-up next to me: horrified
keep staring at the smashed body
whisper: (') Remember where you live
Reuben has to use both hands to steady himself

(
) (cont'd) Boyce Bradley, Chief of Detectives
Smartest man in town
And one of the richest: Dad was a Real Estate Developer who owned a strip of land that's now known as the Santa Monica Freeway
On either side, Bradley's book-ends:
Bob Gallaudet, not the smartest man in town: `Gas Chamber' Bob cribbed my notes at  Law
And Tom Bethune, running for a City Council seat that'll decide if this Mexican slum called Chavez Ravine gets bulldozed and renamed `Dodger Stadium
'              * Turn it off
Bethune leaps like a lapdog, hits the power
was pissing
He was jumping
Bradley picks up a newspaper: ` Attorney Noonan is accusing the Los Angeles Police Department in general, and Lt
David Klein in particular, of murder at worst, gross incompetence at best
' Noonan had Sanderline scared
After he sang to me he panicked & jumped
He did spend a month in Camarillo Mental Hospital last year- -and wearing that hotel robe over his clothes makes him look even more looney-bin
Plus, Reuben Ruiz recanted
So Noonan's Boxing Probe is dead
He's got nothing- -but time, a mandate and new targets
need to speak to the Lieutenant alone
9
Bob and Tom nod, pat my back on the way out: proud uncles lending support before Dad drops the hammer
Door closes stand, step to the window, big Pro-Mex protest below: Geeks and placards: `
(') Describe to me your duty, as you understood it, regarding Sanderline Johnson and Reuben Ruiz
Take both men into custody before Noonan and the Feds could, and find                   * out what they were going to tell- -and why did  choose you for this
Because 'm a Cop with a law degree, and you thought my legal- -because your a thug with a law degree
Because  thought by now you'd be so indebted to this Department for not indicting and/or                   * imprisoning you, that diligent, honest discharge of duty would be assured
(beat) And  made a horrible misjudgment
* Bethune and Gallaudet don't think so
Bob's happy because he wants to be State Attorney General and his most likely opponent will be Welles Noonan
Tom's happy because Morton Diskant, who's leading their City Council race, is endorsed by Noonan
Thus, they're not seeing the larger play
(with calculated emphasis) Noonan's new target will likely be the  itself
How do you know that
10
Because that's where  would aim: a subpoenaed Federal witness plummets to his death in the company of two detectives
(beat) This screams Police Corruption
* This offers Noonan the possibility of payback in the form of national headlines
wave it all off: Johnson did that stint at the Nut House -- leak his file to your friends at the times- -and Bradley drops his bomb: Coroner's file
stare
guess the contents
try to keep my heart rate in-check
My friends would be more interested in this
(beat, flipping file open) Coroner's preliminary: white paint chips found embedded in Sanderline Johnson's scalp
matching dent on the white window sill
checked with the hotel switchboard and found a call was patched to your room at about the same time Johnson flew out of it
(beat, proclamation:) It shocks and sickens me that your allegiance to the Chicago mob would take precedence over the
(fuck drawing this out) Alright
Where's this going
* (pull my badge, table it) Gun
Shield
What
The appearance of disciplinary measures taken against you are mandated post-Sanderline Johnson,                    * so your suspension will be recorded but sealed
and kept quiet for now-                 * 11
So if the papers or Noonan come sniffing around- -we can provide adequate proof of your dismissal
But you're not dismissing me
Just on paper
(closes the file) Since  misjudged the Cop  thought you were, 'm going to leverage the Cop that you are
Bradley slides the morning paper over
Front page: `Candidate Diskant Hears The Hue and Cry of The Underclass
' The photo shows a smiling Diskant, rolled shirt-sleeves, in the middle     * of a sea of  Immigrants, all smiling back
* (') Morton Diskant is to be removed from the City Council race
The means and methods implemented to that end  will entrust to you
(throw a thumb at Bethune) You want me to torpedo Diskant so your buddy Bethune can win a City                      * Council seat uncontested- -or spend the next month in lock-up                    * before being arraigned on charges                      * of gross misconduct and dereliction                    * of duty

Drain my mug
To Pete: Wanna do  a favor tonight
No
We're going to the Cocoanut- -Pete puts an extended index finger in front of Meg's lips, which she bends backwards
'Favor' mean `free

Already hip to how many ways you can make money with a badge

On the 16th, right
How old
Old
What are you writing
* Head down, scribbling mid-sentence, makes me wait a beat
Just notes

Mostly compare and contrast stuff
Street work versus textbook- -chapter 1: don't write shit down
Chapter 2: or other Cops might kill                 * you
Junior's look practiced in a mirror: clicks the pen, slides the steno away

Indictments
Prison time

Holy Jesus

My Hamilton says 11:04
Streets deserted
Pete walking in Diskant's direction now as  continue to roll toward both
Pete close, dig his giant head nodding `hello
' (
) Seen Pete do this a dozen times and every time the same thought: Pete suddenly puts his back into an left hook: hammers Diskant from nowhere as they pass
Instant-ugly crumble
(
) (') God help me if he ever hits me like that
Pete hoists Diskant by his waist-band, tosses him in the backseat
accelerate out, obeying every law

Put the icing on it
baffled moment as the comment registers
What
Tell me that wouldn't sell it
plus he's a Communist
We're ruining his career, not his soul
Reload the camera
Diskant finally speaks: marble-mouthed
Pushes Quiff away: Off me
Don't waste a second: grab Diskant by the hair, narrate his immediate future
Drop out of the City Council race or  send these pictures to the papers
Diskant rips his head free
Rage
Blood from his mouth
* Scanning the room, sizing up the situation, then:               * 'll fight you rotten- -and maybe salvage something that's a close cousin to `respect
' But what about your wife and kid getting hold of those pictures
19
Wait for the big futile scream/struggle
Keep waiting
Diskant just sits
No words
And now  wish he'd cry, throw punches, anything
but he doesn't
turn to Junior: (') Take the Quiff home
My name's Franklin- -of course it is
Junior pulls Quiff out the door
By his hand
Just Pete, Me, and Diskant now
Silent moments drag sour
(') need a nod from you Morton, let's me know you get it- -don't say my name
He gets it
Someone from the Times will call for a quote
Whatever your reason for dropping out make it real
As Pete and  turn to leave: (not looking at us) You eventually lose the ability to reconcile the things you've done to people
That's Hell

) Captain Dan Wilhite, Head of the Narcotics Division
Michigan Catholic poisoned by 25 years in this desert
Recently divorced despite seven kids with his Ex
Why are you here
You smell like bourbon Wilhite- -fuck off
This is handled
And pull your idiot partner out of there- -Junior's already here- -Magdalena was my Snitch, so it's my scene
-push past him, toward the house
Then get Bradley on the horn, so you can relay that order

Now, what happened

Magdalena's missing

And presumed what
could give a shit
just want to this case to get a quick burial
'll bet
Who made the call
Some old broad heard an `argument' and buzzed Wilshire Station
* Where's the family
The wife and daughter were in Santa Barbara
Just got back
(check my Hamilton) At 2
* * The Wife said she got into a fight          * with her Parents, left

We bullet- proofed him in exchange for 60% of his profit and a promise he only deal drugs in Darktown and East -                  * -Black and Mexican- -give the man a prize

* wouldn't have expected so public a showing after Sanderline Johnson
He jumped Fritz
Koenig flashes that grin again
'm sure he did
And where is your young partner this day
Working his first big job
Might the job involve the 's most important missing Wetback, Hector Magdalena
My eyes narrow but stay smiling: It does
Koenig nods, casts his gaze out over the crowd
've known Stemmons since the academy
He was a top pupil
* peculiar little pain in the ass, but very good with details
37
Kid might have some climb in him
(look back at Bradley) Reminds me of another pain in the ass
Koenig roars this big frightening laugh of his
'm puzzled as to why the Bradley would assign you to the Magdalena                     * case when you're neither Homicide nor Robbery
There's no body, and nothing was taken except Hector
He does know how to delegate doesn't he
and also 'm sure that poor Negro's nosedive has put you squarely in his debt
Something like that
* Keep me abreast will you
Chief Parker is understandably nervous
Situations like these tend to yield grief

We can't risk that
Do you             * make him for the murderer
Yeah
Hector's disappearance is definitely an inside job
That whole family feels hinky
The daughter was all bruises and no tears and Hector's hop-head wife            * looks part punching bag

* According to Wilhite, they were in Santa Barbara at the time

Where is your partner
Vouching in evidence at Wilshire Station

Focus everything on that effort &  want him apprehended Klein, not killed
What about Hector
Still missing
And most likely dead
Find the Son

But  am interested in your                       * leading lady
Bradley sent me
Saw                    * her at the Bethune- 48
-not a chance
'm still trying to play hide the submarine
You want Chief Bradley angry
Ten years ago  could call for that                   * little Pisher's head on a stick
(looks around) And now
And now the only thing you're putting on sticks are corn dogs
What's her name, Mick
Glenda
(still looking for )                           * Why was she there
Low-budget strategy:  send Glenda and Rock to any event where there's cameras -- Glenda gets guest-a'- honor treatment everywhere with that shape a' her's
What she drive
30
1955  -                               30 Following the tail-lights of a 56 Corvette
Top-down, whipping Blond hair split-second visible under passing street lights
Glenda pulls into what  guess is her place: tiny- tidy Glendale flat
roll past: no eye contact
Around the block
Park on the next street over
Waiting until think of what comes next
get out now
31
-                                 31 Up to a fence
Scratch it: make sure a nuts-hungry Pooch isn't slobbering on the other side
Nothing
Vault the fence
Dodge a pool
Over another fence and into- 49
32
'  -                        32 -creep to a window: curtains pulled
Creep to another: there she is
Watch her: elegant fingers emanate from hands only now beginning to betray age
Watch her shake her sandals off
Arranging three coffee cups on a tray: company coming
On cue: another car
`53 Cadillac: the Director and Rock Rockwell
crane my neck to get as much of her as  can
She leaves the tray, cups steaming
Muffled greetings
Check the window, open
Slide it up gentle
33
-                         33 Glenda clearing seats
Coffee's in the kitchen
Let's go over this quick because 'm beat
We're set on a place where we can stash you and Rock
It's in Topanga Canyon, two weeks- (petulant) -two weeks
My body'll fall apart- -think of it as 14 days of push-ups- (to the Director) Are you sure about this Sid
Seems shaky
Was this Mickey's idea
And  think it's brilliant
Inspired
The two leads of Mickey Cohen's magnum opus get kidnapped
The press'll eat it up
They'll write about `Gangster Mickey,' the glory days
Couple a' headlines like that and interest in Atomic Vampires will go through the roof
(to Glenda) Who's gonna grab you
charmer  knew in another life
George Ainge
50
Pat myself down for a pen, scribble on my hand: "----" Is he okay with making it look real- -he can't hit me in the face
* That's a deal-breaker
He'll be thrilled to knock me around
Plus he's holding something of mine, so we can kill two birds
He'll grab us Tuesday in front of the Pacific Dining Car
* What about Hughes
What about him
That angle can only help us
'm dying to know
was he the Spruce Goose between the sheets
34
'  -                        34 My face folds up -- jealous-sour frown
reach in, steal one   * of the steaming cups, bolt
Audible as  retreat: (
) Hung like a newborn and he called my tits `propellers
' Belly laughter from inside
(
) The real howler: fake kidnappings always bomb

1955  -                               35 Parked
Tepid pulls off the stolen mug
Done
Toss it to the    * passenger side: lands on a bed of crumpled Styrofoam
Look up: the Magdalena residence looms a few doors down
Glance at the passenger seat: an envelope lined with fifty $100 bills
The name:  written across the front
Pick it up
51
(
) Thinking  could tip Milteer off to the kidnap plot and pick up the other half of my payment
(stare at that money) Thinking  should just give the first half back now
'cuz  know right now 'll never hurt her
Toss the envelope into the glove-box, slam it shut
Scan
Two heads in one of the unmarked patrol cars  ordered
Cursory nods as they pass
Tail-lights fade
Dead quiet save my low Jazz
Fighting my drift
Check my Hamilton

Exhaustion steals it
full hour earlier than  told                     * Junior to meet me

* Yawn
Look up
Lucille Magdalena at her window
Sudden
* Startling: no blouse, pig-tails, big silver-dollar nipples touch/steam glass
Pushes the curtains back even further
Adrenaline cuts through the lactic acid: wide awake now
see her eyes aren't sex-placid or rolled back -- they're scanning -- hopeful to glimpse someone outside looking back
* (
) (')                            * This routine had been done before
That old broad babbling about a Peeper
The only other link to Hector Magdalena's disappearance
* She holds her scan for a blink, a different smile, eyes sex- placid now, rolled-back now -- she just saw what she was looking for: hidden eyes staring back at her
look to where saw her gaze kink

Walking/scanning,
45 flush against my leg
Sticking to shadows
Cross the street: two homes down
Quiet steps
Closer: a snubbed cigarette smoulders in the gutter
Glance back up at the window, Lucille gone -- a forearm shiver flashes from nowhere blunts/blasts the back of my head
Nose-first into asphalt
Too angry to black out
Spit       * blood and scream at the same time so it sounds like drowning: - 52
Still unsure what hit me
Pick-up my gun, clear my nose of gouting blood, stand, weave: a figure in black, sprinting away:
Wipe away impact-tears, aim, realize my trigger   * finger is dislocated -- bent back ugly
Tuck the gun use my     * left hand to pop it back in -- deep growl -- re-aim: --
The Peeper pitches
Visible in the streetlight: a red puff off his right shoulder
Headlights at end of the block, behind me, come to life now- Baritone of a big -8
* Peeper fighting for balance, keeps running
sprint heedless, round the corner: follow a blood-trail, panting, bleeding my own trail
Lift my eyes to see the Peeper shoulder through a fence, vanish into a backyard
Neighborhood mutts yelp a chorus
cross the street- -those headlights swerve hard in front of me: Black Buick
* look down in time to watch my knee detonate a quarter-panel
bounce off like someone yanked a leash
Crumble-yell
Hands pick me up
fight back before  even see at whom 'm swinging: square-jawed types, eyes hidden by Bureau derbies
* Welles Noonan gets out of the passenger-side of the Buick
Punches me as hard as he can without provocation: nothing to write home about
My gun clatters to the ground
That's for Sanderline Johnson
(nod at the Peeper trail) - -what were you firing at
The only lead on Magdalena -- we're after the same guy you idiot
(to one of the goons) -write that name down: `Magda-- na' or `Magda--na
' (back to me) No, we were after you
But thanks for the name
Sag under the weight of my own insomnia-fed stupidity
* 53
(
) Assumed the Feds were smart
Assumed they were ready to stick a new probe into the 's deal with Hector, like Bradley warned, like everyone feared
But they had no                        * clue and  just handed them the whole God damn thing
(beat) Like  said:  need sleep
Raise my face now, eyes intent, chin out
(') First punch you ever thrown Noonan
Your Mom have to teach you how because Dad was the same no-chin, Connecticut Faggot you are
Noonan stops, turns back to me: blazing
(
) (') think  hit the Noonan family dynamic, dead-on
He winds up an overhand right: a big-bright flash, then           * darkness that feels like lying down on a sunlit lawn
: (
) Drop him
#1 (
) You don't want to take him in
(
) only want to bring him in when know he'll never leave

Someone pushed a table and two chairs to one side: space for the cot 'm on
Look up
Junior looking down: `Concerned' isn't strong enough
In his undershirt
He slips the red steno pad into his back pocket
Sit up balled dress shirt in my hand, blood sopped
Gaze at my Hamilton, face cracked, `5:16am'-- Fritz Koenig walks in, silver pitcher in hand
gape up, still punchy

Coffee
Ice
Bradley's on his way down
Toss the dress shirt to the floor
That's mine
you needed some                        * mopping up
Who found me
did
got there at eleven like you said, right as two black & white's pulled up: you were out                      * cold in a gutter `round the block
* (this blithe little grin) Did Noonan knock you out
He hit me with his car first
(a nod to Koenig) The Captain was the only one here at this hour
* Look from Junior and Koenig to the window behind him -- Bradley steam-rolling our way
To Koenig, conspiratorial:      * If  need your help later on, can count on it
Of course you can
Take the pitcher from him, drop my head, douse myself, the cold cuts cobwebs
Bradley walks in, imperious
Koenig moves past -- ice forms between the two
* (') Chief
What are you doing here
The Lieutenant was thirsty
55
Koenig closes the door
refuse to look up at Bradley
Progress on Magdalena
point to Junior -- happy to play teacher's pet:                * No fingerprints
Clean crime scene
Canvassed the neighborhood senile neighbor did report a possible Peeper- -rubbing the back of my head where the Peeper bashed me- -confirmed Peeper
Bradley turns to me: Is that who knocked you out
Noonan knocked me out
(beat) He's having you tailed then
And he knows the Magdalena name and that  was chasing a suspect -- the                    * Peeper Lucille strips for
* She knows someone watches
And who he is
She has to
(back to Bradley) want access to her juvie sheet or                    * whatever arrest records exist
* Rumor was Hector whored her out to                     * dealers he did business with
* That's immaterial
* * (as my teeth grit)                                 * It is if you're eliminating her as                     * a suspect-                                             * 56

* * spoke with a Mr
and Mrs
Preston                  * Mott of Santa Barbara, the parents                   * of Madge Magdalena nee Mott and                      * they've confirmed their visit and                    * also corroborated the argument that                  * resulted in them leaving early
* * (back to me now)                                 * One alteration to my previous orders- * -previous orders being what
Assign the Cop Noonan blames for his dead boxing probe to the case that's becoming his new crusade
* Bradley conjures the Roman visage
then slowly opens the      * door, staring holes in me
* * Step out Stemmons
* Junior balks, looks my way: tries to mimic my sneer
stand   * and shove him toward the door
His look back at me: Judas
* Bradley closes the door behind him
* (')                           * No direct approach on the mother or                  * the daughter
* No
Madge was a battered wife and                    * Lucille was a suborned whore
If                     * that's not motive, what is
You                      * want answers then we brace those                     * two hard
* If you do so directly, if they're                    * formally questioned then Noonan may                  * find out and go after them with Federal warrants
57
Noonan will figure out who and what Hector was sooner or later
* * Yes he will, so we buy time, keep him busy- -until when
Until Tom Bethune votes on the floor of the city council in two days, ratifying the official start of construction on Dodger stadium- -this is bigger than a fucking ballpark
Hector Magdalena and Narco is the powder-keg, blows the              * whole Department to hell
* Don't be dramatic, it looks weak
Right now, Noonan needs a pursuit, so  supply him with one-                       * -me
You want me to draw him off-               * -you've been drawing him off
And the more he sees you the less he'll think of anything other than getting you
Now find Tommy and                 * take him alive
Do not let Noonan               * get to him
As a potential major                * case witness against the ,                  * Tommy Magdalena isn't just a powder-            * keg, he's an atom bomb

All eyes on my wounds

Seltzer will take the blood out

Takes a     * deep breath

The one you asked about
Thanks
But forget it
spent a whole day putting it together and this skirt's got skeletons
Reminded, glance at my hand: "    " in smeared ink
Junior rips open a file, blathers Bledsoe preliminaries: (') Shoplifting in Bakersfield at 17
Prostitution arrest at 21
Known associate of a Kern County homicide victim, this convicted pimp named Dwight Gillette, probably her pimp
Stabbed to death in his home, weapon never recovered- Forget it
Burn it, s'not important now
Take the file from him, flip through; thorough, detailed
Glenda priors scream back instant conviction
59
Why is it not important
Plant the file in his chest as my answer
need an address on a guy named Ainge, George Ainge-                                    * -what about Magdalena
My temper turning threadbare
-after you get the Ainge address,                       * get back to the Magda- (picks up Glenda's file) -is Ainge related to this Cunt
Snap-grit-grab him: buttons from his shirt pop, bounce
We're partners in name only
You want to stay in the room next time, Junior
Do something to impress me: like finding that address
Dig Junior trying to hide tears now behind that mad-dog glare: makes me want to break the bones in his face

Her right hand claws at tile
These beautiful dark eyes stare up at me like she was hoping for someone sooner

Some beach flop he fled to after his wife put him out
Check my Hamilton: 7:32
car pulls into the parking lot
Two suits step out, ramrod straight, starched officious: Process Servers if ever 've seen them
One of them bears a sealed envelope as they walk to room #11 and knock
No answer
They knock rude
roll down my window
Dan Wilhite answers in a robe: Groggy-pissed-hungover
Before he utters a word, he's handed the sealed envelope and the pair depart
Wilhite calls after, tearing open the envelope and reading what's inside
then rereading it
Gauge his reaction: ruined
He puts his hand on top of his head
like he's trying to protect it from the sky that is now falling down around him
Another big pause staring at nothing
then he just calmly walks back inside the room, closing the door behind him
65

Quietly hustling up to Wilhite's door: Reach it and hear a distinct  -- see the flash-snap from behind the curtains: Gunshot
know what it is
Hit the door
66
'  -                           66 Wilhite's service revolver a foot away from one hand, a sheet of paper still gripped in the other
Body half onto the bed, half off
Blood drains from a round wound in his temple
Check behind me, nobody coming- close the hotel door
Pick up the sheet of paper/contents of the envelope
The first word see:
(
) My first thought, pure panic: Noonan figured the Narco-Magalena connection
87
Flip the Subpoena over to see his Signature: not Noonan's
This subpoena has been issued and signed by  District Attorney Bob Gallaudet
Flip it back over, wide-eyed: (
) (') But it wasn't a Federal Subpoena
Wilhite was being called to testify by Bob Gallaudet, a man who doesn't piss without Bradley's say-so
(beat) Bradley trying to beat Noonan to the punch and burn the himself

Walk to Wilhite's Studebaker Powerhawk
Pop the trunk, return to his room
Move quick

Toss his service
38 too
Pour the bottle of bleach to stanch the inevitable rot smell

) Swap my car for Wilhite's

swung by his apartment, car was out front
scoped it: a sawed- off shotgun in front, canned tuna in the back seat
Think he's living outta that car
After he left, tried to get inside his place: The front door is triple pad-locked

Shit
Ignore it, maybe Pete will too
Meet me down the street from his place
You got bolt cutters

-                               73 Junior's stucco-beige apartment building looms a block up
Cursory checks of the rear and side-view mirrors
Sans tail as  pull the Powerhawk in behind Pete's Caddy
Step out, sidle up driver's side
Who's car is that
Long story
Junior looked real skeezed this morning
Like he was on a dope jag
Yeah
Sweated up like a stuck pig
And be careful
He was fucking around with his front door before he left don't know what he was doing
Two honks if he shows

Junior: #303: three padlocks:hinge/receiver hardware extending between door and jamb
Three kicks and a shoulder to splinter the door
Stop, look: Some kind of twine stretched taut, just inside the door
trip-wire
Pull my pig- sticker, extend it between door and jamb
see the twine stretching tighter -- flick the blade, snag twine, slice it
Stand
Put my boot into the door full
Snaps at the hinges

303 -                                 76 Move slow
Examine close: Eye-bolt pulley system, jerry- rigged around the door
Severed twine attached to the trigger of a shotgun taped atop a jello mold at knee level
Continue to look around
Sex-horror grimace: like catching Pop fingering Mom
Junior's place a tiny, filthy one bedroom
(
) Junior the Insane: You couldn't hide what he was hiding in 1958 , and not have it rot your mind
Bear traps barely hidden under sheets
Rat-traps garnished with razor blades across the floor
Smell rotten flowers: his shirt that  wore/bled-on crumpled on his pillow -- yellowed jizz stains cover black blood stains
Stifle a gag
Card table: an empty green-banded evidence bag
Gape at it
Then walk over, read the abstracts: 1284 South Tremaine
(
) Junior stealing evidence from the Magdalena crime scene
91
Then  see the bookcase
Top shelf: Police manuals
Bottom two shelves: wall-to-wall red steno-pads, all exactly the same brand
Shock
Step over
Flip through them: tiny, architect-neat script covers every page
The running dialogue of a functional fucking freak: 1284

Thinks bootlicking will buy him a Bureau gig
Now, rifle for that knife
Systemically destroy the place
Dump the stenos in a trash can, sift for matches, strike, watch the pads catch and floosh, feed the fire with random paperwork, sift -- Junior's cock-obsessed doodles scribbled by the dozen
Under the bed now, carpet covered in rat-traps
Spring them, clear a space
Box: beefcake booty, gay smut mags, gay classified ads
First-person perspective Polaroids of Junior's stomach being kissed by the Diskant Quiff and vice- versa
Open a massive steamer trunk against a far wall
Arsenal: handguns, shotguns, a surplus -1
Dump it, kick contents
Only interested in that knife
92
Move into his kitchenette
Check the freezer even though Junior is smarter than that: amyl-nitrate poppers, vodka, benzedrine, cocaine
Close it
Look down
: indents in the cheap tile floor from where the refrigerator used to sit
Pull to see what's behind
Eyes catch the bear-trap near the bed as  tug: ugly-rusted-waiting
part : Contort, peer behind the refrigerator: a pineapple-shaped hand grenade duct-taped to the wall, next to a built-in safe
(
) The safe scared me more than all of it because a safe doesn't get installed overnight
he'd been working on something, planning something
Twine leads from the grenade's pin to the back of the refrigerator
My bolt-cutters snap it
Pull the refrigerator out now
The safe bolted into the drywall
Stare at it: the dial, the black paint-job
: Loading shells into the shotgun that was atop that jello mold
Back into the kitchen
Exhale
Massive noise
Six shots
Reload fast: nothing can muffle this clatter
Eyes closed to keep chunks of drywall out
Gagging on gunsmoke
Rip at the safe -- something gives
The Safe hits the floor, leaves a hole
Through the ringing in my ears: something that sounds like honks
Quick peek: Pete gone
Black Buick with two white- walled  up front
Then Junior gets out of the backseat
Scoop the freezer drugs, the stack of man-porn, the snapshots, and toss a whole armful into the hallway in front of Junior's door
Grab the green-banded evidence bag and tuck it under my arm
Back into the kitchenette
Turn on the gas but don't light the burners
Pull the grenade off the wall
Drag the safe to the rear of his place: the fire escape
77
-                                77 Out the window, on the escape, toss the evidence-bag down to Pete, then push the safe over the railing
Feature it almost crush the back of Pete's idling Cadillac
Pete jumps, yells: Asshole
93
Get it open if you can and meet me back at Meg's
Doesn't move until  pull the pin on the pineapple, drop the pin down on him
He jumps back in, peels off- 78
'   -                 78 -Junior on the second-floor landing, heading to his place
Bloodshot bleary wide eyes, spun on a combo of drugs, the Feds herding him like a rabid dog: Stay right here
'll get it all and come back
Don't move
79
-                                 79 Ricochet the grenade back into the kitchen
Leap down half a flight: put exterior brick between my head and the- -  -- the grenade goes off
80
'   -                 80 Junior knocked on his ass halfway up the last flight
Feds come sprinting
Screaming Junior tackles one on the way up
Juniors' front-door blown off
Terrified Neighbors greeted with images of Sodom scattered from the explosion: drugs, mags, dildos
The Fed that didn't get tackled picks up a photo: Junior kissing a hairy stomach
And Junior's mind snaps cleanly in-half
Crawls away growling like a bear caught in one of his traps
81
-                                       81 step calm
Clear the alley slow
Don't let your stride give you away
Another Black Buick arrives
More Bureau stiffs
Keep moving
Looky-Loos pop up along the block, pointing
'm the only one not looking back toward Junior's now flaming pad
The Powerhawk still another street up
Fire engines wail close
Shouts from behind now
Look back: a Bureau putz pointing my way -- one of the Buicks tearing up the block toward me
94

Keep going and give up Wilhite's car and the corpse inside, or lay back and deal with Noonan's Buzzcuts

Edgar is a slanted fuck, but traditionally `vicious fags' don't make the best major case witnesses
(beat, keep pushing) 'm worried those burning dildos may have damaged his credibility
Oh  don't need his testimony Klein
'll just force yours
95
Not if you had the next hundred years
Sanderline Johnson, your links to Sam Giancana to Mickey Cohen, extortion, bribes, murder-for-hire
'll put you in every pair of cross- hairs  can find
'll torch everything you've ever touched
You have no idea how deep  run Klein
And how far 'm willing to go to fuck you- -everyone knows 'm a piece-a-shit
What are you proving
Bradley's the guy flanking you right now
The guy who's vulnerable right now
You're all angles and graft Klein
Why trust a God damn word that comes out of your- -you done anything with the Magdalena case
(thrown) Prelims: drug pusher gone missing, presumed dead, we're investigat- (scoffing) -Dealing drugs for 20 years
Arrested once
Hall a' fame career
You photographed the head of Narco in-front of his house
Jesus Christ, you need cue cards
(sell this fucker now) Come after me: you get me
Go after what  can give you and you get the 's power-set on a slab
96
don't believe you'd turn
Treacherous yes, traitorous no
Tell me where Stemmons' files are
'll bring them to you
You're not leaving here Klein
Then like  said: you only get me
Noonan stands, firm: 'll take it
On his way out  speak fast -- the last ace in my deck: give you the body of Dan Wilhite, head of 's Narcotics Division
Proof of a 20-year criminal collusion between his department and Hector Magdalena and my testimony to link the dots
(beat, make him believe) Then  leave  for good
Noonan at the door: please bite-please bite
but he just smirks, walks out
Real panic now: no ideas on what comes next
15 seconds
Door opens again: one of Noonan's deputies pushes a sheet
Scan it: Federal Witness Agreement
Noonan back: two cups of coffee
Read it over
What happened to Wilhite
Suicide
Like Sanderline Johnson
Ignore him
Sign the agreement
(') Get me Stemmons files and Wilhite's body by noon tomorrow
Gulp the coffee back, the burn feels good
97
No more tails
don't want anyone else incriminated
Agreed
(nod to agreement) get a copy of that
After a judge signs it
Now Leave
Stand-nod-take my coffee-leave
Door closes
Noonan shreds the Witness agreement
Tosses it in the trash
Off the baffled Deputy
(') We wait for him to deliver, then we arrest him
You never saw that agreement
#1 Tail him
No
Let him get comfortable

Pete in the garage adjacent the kitchen, welder's goggles and a power drill, punching holes in Junior's safe
know what Feds look like -- those were Feds with Junior
98
Yeah and they made me leaving the scene
Had to barter out
Barter what
My Testimony
signed a Federal Witness Agreement
Pete drops the drill
You what
It's bullshit
Noonan's got no intention of honoring it
(beat) They want Stemmons files though think Junior's been working angles for awhile, doing his own investigations
What did you do to his place
Nice quiet neighborhood one minute, Nagasaki the next
(point to safe) He had a hand grenade tied to that
(as Pete resumes drilling) How much longer do you need
Few more hours
Maybe
Junior didn't skimp on this thing
gotta bore right through the face plate

She's dressed for bed
don't hesitate, afraid she'll shun me
Move to her, she doesn't startle
An arm around her waist, drawing her in, my mouth close to hers
take her face in my hand, check her eyes, a beat before they tell me it's okay
lean in, takes a lifetime
and kiss her soft until she kisses back, her mouth moving over my split lips, she puts her hands on my face, pulling me in
She feels exactly like  imagined
My coat comes off
Her camisole follows
We're moving toward a bed in back
stop, pull back, the moonlight moves over her shoulders
whisper: tell me if 'm being too rough
Tears squeezed through smiling eyes, she kisses me even harder, pulls me down to her
We make love like we've never touched another
Everything blurs, burns down: Bradley
Wilhite
Tommy
Hector Junior
Ainge
She takes it all away

Not once
Tell me anything
Tell me everything
Label her surprise, her brow that furrows and unfurrows just as quickly
long moment as she waivers
commits: Where would  start
Why here
Why
(this amazing smile) Why is anybody here
Want the rest of the world to know who they are

You
No
don't think so

My aunt, every week, she'd take me to the movies
Me watching her
tucks her hair back over his shoulders

Make her laugh
Swear a thousand silent oaths to protect her

Hughes told me he could get me in for this screen test two years ago
Movie with Gregory Peck at Universal
He thought he was humoring me
until  got it
They offered me the role
there in the room
So Howard, who 'm sure never thought in a million years 'd land that part, makes some phone calls and just like that they don't want me anymore
(beat) Nobody calls now
can't get in to see any studio casting people
He's ruined me in those circles
And you still want it- -bad enough to put on a silly cheerleading skirt and try to make the most god-awful dialogue sound decent

Surrounded by winos in werewolf suits

dedication
Or desperation
Depends on the day
The laughter ebbs, her eyes still shine

let the silence take
try not to shatter it with: Dwight Gillette
She doesn't blanch
He asked me to take his `niece and nephew' to their cousin in Oxnard
These beautiful, funny little kids
(tears she doesn't swipe) dropped them off
Didn't ask any questions --  believed Dwight week later  saw their pictures in the Post Office
week after that their little bodies came in on the tide near San Pedro
(beat, tears stream) 'll never shake the thought that maybe those poor kids thought  was part of it
That  knew what was going to happen to them
So  pray to God that he let them look in when  put that knife into Dwight
(beat) But 'll never ask his forgiveness for doing it
(beat, clears her eyes) Why do they call you `Enforcer

never takes her eyes away from mine

Why did you sign with Hughes, knowing what he was
`For profit -- mostly
' Silence
feeling like: `and there we are
' 'm not much good
Me neither
She touches my quake
Two breaths with her hand on mine and it all goes quiet: the shakes, the images, the fear
She takes my head, pulls me to her bare breasts
The only things audible: my breathing, a clock ticking
Both slowly fade out
Wake up quiet, look at my Hamilton

Sit up slow
Look back at her, sleeping, just stare

Stay quiet
Maneuver into the kitchen
Turn on a light
On the table: safe open, it's contents laid-out neatly, short- stacks of files, $1000 in twenties
sit, start searching for something else
Pete's voice behind me: (
) The Knife ain't there
File on top of that middle pile: George Ainge in an `undisclosed locale
' don't turn
Pete sits next to me
Sets a shotgun down
Junior documented everything like a fucking Monk
(pulls a file) Like here: `has evidence' you murdered Sanderline Johnson
() 103
(cont'd) Kept track of `suspected contract killings' you pulled for the mob
Look at Pete
Dark rings, deathbed eyes
You been up all night
In-case Stemmons made a house-call
He's got every goddamn address of everybody you know
(beat, hard) And you should've told me about the Bledsoe broad
There's nothing to tell
Feature Pete, righteously pissed: Then call Milteer about this dead Pimp Gillette
'm no legal mind like you, but 'll bet a murder beef would violate her morals clause quick
(beat, hands phone) Collect the rest of your money
don't want it anymore
Then give that five grand back
Junior stole it
Pete pauses, scoffs, turns back toward Meg's bedroom walks: People are gonna start lining-up to see you bleed, Pal
Door closes
flip through Junior's files: the same architect-neat block printing
Find a Glenda entry: Gillette, -    -- ' 1946 104

habitual eye toward Junior's desk: Koenig going through his drawers
Stop
Veer toward him
(formal-frosty) Your young partner called me at my home, early this morning
Teeth grit
Hide it
Let Koenig talk
(') Heavily inebriated
Speaking inarticulately of `betrayal,' & how the  was set to be `blitzed by justice
' Is this the `bind' of which we spoke earlier
Yeah
And his apartment -- there was some type of disturbance
fire
That's why  needed his address was trying to help him before something like this happened
The kid snapped-in-half Fritz
He's literally lost it
(beat, deadpan) He say anything else to you
Koenig looks back at me
Give nothing away
one gesture that doesn't read right and he'll know
He lets more seconds pass than he should
Trying to shake me
105
Only that he was in possession of materials that might deeply damage Chief Bradley
and yourself
Like  said Fritz, he's flipped his lid
don't want to go to Internal Affairs but 'm afraid Junior might've forced just that
Let me try to locate the lad first Dave
Be a shame to ruin such a young career so soon
Be careful Fritz
He's dangerous
Spin, press on toward Bradley's office
(
) Fritz Koenig, the best inspector in the , digging
He'll find Junior and when he does he'll find Ainge
then Glenda
Reach Bradley's office, burst in
Empty
To his Secretary: Where is he

Walking
Check my Hamilton: 12:10
(
) Noonan's deadline lapsed ten minutes ago
An official fugitive from justice now
Down below, Bradley with Reuben Ruiz in-tow: glazed-fear, following him like he's handcuffed
gather, placards hoisted, chants: "Dodgers, No
Mexico, Si
" The group gathers steam, supporters pack in, the chorus continues: "
' 106
(
) Bradley doing damage control, the forced relocation of the Ravine's immigrants has the press in a feeding frenzy
Reuben Ruiz forced along as the token Mexican mouthpiece
Reporters press
Bradley handles them with ease and aplomb
-this area has long been rife with crime and venality, but with a brand new Stadium, we can make this horrible blight a bright spot and give our Los Angeles Dodgers the home they deserve
(like Ruiz was an orphan) Reuben Ruiz can tell you of his travails growing up in this horrible slum and why now is the time to `Redeem The Ravine
' #2 Chief Bradley,
Attorney Noonan has promised to deliver surprise witnesses before the Federal Grand jury on- -Bradley, this brilliant rebuke: -Welles Noonan is an unscrupulous hack politician whose smear campaign against us will fail, for he has grievously underestimated the moral rectitude of the Los Angeles Police Department
Then Bradley sees me
His press-friendly face contorts, the shift startling: if only a flashbulb could've framed it
He shifts back from snarl to smile
Now if you'll excuse me, 'll leave you with Reuben Ruiz
Ruiz begins his forced/coerced/do-it-or-we'll-fuck-you sob story as Bradley steps away from the glare

Get right on his heels
107
Your subpoena hasn't caught up to me yet, Chief
Bradley spins back
(') (hand him Junior's file) Hurwitz Holdings
Bradley blanches, buckles
see it
Before he can play stupid with: `What
' (') You, Bethune, and Gallaudet bought big chunks of Chavez Ravine over the past two years through a shell company called Hurwitz Holdings
(beat, look around) If the Dodgers move here the value of the land booms
you could sell it off for a fortune -- or hang onto it and make even more
The parking lots alone would make you all multi-millionaires
Bradley removes his glasses, staring at documentation that dooms both his immediate and distant future
Word gets out that the three City Officials who were pushing hardest for a Stadium also stood to gain a mint -- might color public opinion
Might color it even more to know that the 's Chief of Detectives was trying to purchase a huge tract of that land from the biggest dope dealer in town
Slap another file over the one he's reading
Hector Magdalena owned ten and half acres of this land
(beat, ram him) You didn't give a shit about solving his disappearance
You were worried that your real estate deal was going south
() 108
(cont'd) That's why you wanted Tommy found, not because he was a murder suspect or you were concerned that Noonan might tap him as a federal witness
you needed him to finalize your fucking land grab
To sign paperwork in place of his dead Dad
That's why you've got Madge and Lucille in custody now
(beat) Maybe 'll let your subpoena find me now Chief, maybe 'll walk right into it
the tales  could tell
All Bradley can muster is: How
Junior Stemmons
The ex-evidence teacher
His `excellent ratings' didn't stop him from stealing the Magdalena seizure and doing his own investigation
Why would he investigate me
Hand him Noonan's business card: dig the big Federal Eagle in American Blue
That was stapled to the cover
(beat) Why would Noonan worry about a Turd like me now
when a high profile target like you can be taken down
Silence
smile wide at it
Bradley, scrambling
Where is Stemmons
No idea
If you haven't spoken to Internal Affairs today, 'm sure they've called
Junior's apartment caught fire
Deeply deviant material inside
Round him up- (my angle) -and anyone he's got with him
Bradley readjusts his glasses
109
'll issue an
saying Stemmons is a known deviant targeting kindergarten children
Now, quid pro quo
you subpoenaed Wilhite too
Bradley's reaction: Feature the angler getting angled
How do y- -don't worry `how
' Why
Bradley says nothing
Then, like a klieg-light, it hits me
(') You're going after Narco yourself
Exposing the corrupt parts of the will redeem the whole
'll prove that Police can police themselves- -so you show-up Noonan
co-opt his crusade and condemn your own before he can
Jesus Christ can you turn lemons to lemonade
No Cop will testify against other Cops
This is why Wilhite has suddenly disappeared
And how
(beat) So where do we go now Chief
(beat, eyes flick again to the files 'm holding
) There are other forces at work here
faces we need to identify
Names we need to know
third party
() 110
(cont'd) Find out who Klein and 'll reinstate you, rescind that subpoena & burn the coroner's report on Sanderline- -that report is only useful to Noonan now
No
It ensures our mutual destruction should you choose to share the contents of that Stemmons file
Which  know you won't do until you figure out how it will best benefit you
He walks off, imperious, impervious, gets engulfed by the press ranks once again
(
) mistake to underestimate me now Chief
The price to keep your secrets is steep
and you're going to pay up
Soon

Unbutton my coat to show him the file as  approach, tucked right behind my

Where's the knife
Junior, this evil little curl
He turns
Follow him over a small knoll: that Gray Packard, waiting
silhouette behind the wheel
As we near it the lights come on, blind me
Turn your lights off
and just come out and talk to me
Fritz
pause in the car, Junior looks at me like 'm Rasputin, divining answers from the marine-layer moving-in over
The lights pop off and  hear a tired laugh coming from the car that we've all heard before
(
) Third Party Confirmed
fucking knew it
Fritz Koenig steps out of the Packard
Not much with these sub-rosa things
(a nod to the Packard) thought it was Noonan tailing me
Bradley's greatest stroke was enlisting you to his side
Junior, jumpy in my periphery
don't like it
(') Wilhite ran Magdalena for you, not Narco
When did you know
116
didn't
had a feeling smelled cover-up all over Hector's disappearance and Wilhite wouldn't have the muscle or the mind-set to kingpin something that big by himself
you knew about Bradley trying to buy him out
He was offering to exonerate Hector and clear his criminal record
Hector met with Wilhite and  to inform us of his decision
: 94
1284   -                                 94 For the first and only time,   Hector Magdalena, alive and well
for the moment
speaking to Koenig and Wilhite
(
) to accept Bradley's deal
Koenig pets Hector's twin Doberman guard dogs
(
) (') and although the terms of that deal worked well for him
found them less than favorable
Koenig draws a silenced pistol and shoots both dogs before shooting a shocked Hector twice in the chest
Wilhite staggers to his feet as Koenig steps over and delivers the coup de grace head-shot to Hector
Darktown
Chavez Ravine
Hot Spots for Human Vice
These are slums run & profit from
If these slums suddenly become Stadiums, that profit goes elsewhere
that crime goes elsewhere
Bradley
you two got greed in common
Koenig grins
Junior keeps shifting
Dying to shoot him dead
117
You knew about Wilhite and Lucille
That's how you were operating him
was aware of his sexual predilections
(a scowl for Junior) and someone else's
(that great white grin ) We share an eye for human frailty and we're both born blackmailers Dave
(beat) knew young Stemmons here had a fondness for Lads, stretching back to his days at the academy
And now you're his only ally
(back at Junior) This sad queer who fell out with cops and flunked out with the Feds
(back to Koenig) So you get this file to battle Bradley with
What's Junior get in return
And like he was waiting for those words: Junior lunges twist to deflect but he's too fast -- feel something sink and drag in my side
go down, gouge/groping for my gun
Instant trauma zaps nerves numb up the arm, fingers failing
Then a pain like boiling oil moves through my blood
Look down, :  mother-of-pearl knife hilt in my side, the business end stuck deep
Junior laughing as  fall to my knees
He pulls the file from the waist and tosses my
45
(') (two inches from my face) '
Koenig takes the file, opening it
118
(turning his back) don't want to watch
'm sorry it came to this, Dave
Junior, his own
45 pulled, put to my head
hope the Bledsoe whore was worth it
'cuz she's still fucked
For a crooked cop, you think small
Koenig reads the file's first page, lifts it
a blank page behind
and behind that one
(
) Whatever moves  had left
just made
Koenig spins back, more blank pages spilling from the file
This isn't it
-Junior looks: that's all  need
Pull the pig-sticker off my ankle and corkscrew it into his calf, twisting
Junior bleats slaughtered-lamb as  reach up a wrench his gun free
Grab his tie, pull him down as  jut his gun up under his chin and fire two shots through the top of his head
Haul him down dead by his tie, turn -- Koenig's gun-hand flashes to his shoulder
Shoot him twice
He goes down gargling `fuck'
Stand-up on me sea-legs, bad wobble/weave as slowly pull the knife from my side, pocket it
Feel blood flow saturate my pant leg
This weird wooze overcomes me as approach Koenig
He pulls himself into a sitting position, shaking his head
This bemused, beaten, half-grin as he flicks blood from his hand like his fingers had just brushed something sticky
Poorly played Dave
poorly played
Say nothing
Keep Junior's
45 out
My intention crystal clear: endgame
Koenig looks up, this odd squint, like a bum about to beg for change
Could  talk you into something
Cut you in on something
119
Give him no hope
Won't work for me Fritz
He nods, remorse, resignation
it at all looks the same now
Give me a minute then
do
Watch his hands as he removes his shoes, waiting for an ankle grab, his back-up piece
none comes
He sets his shoes aside, gazing up at the starless sky before issuing this short, gruff laugh
some inside joke that will die untold
(with a nod) Okay
and he holds his last breath and seems completely content as  shoot him
Cross to Junior now, rifle his clothes, retrieve a hotel key, Room 16, read it:   - 1195 Centinela Ave
Inglewood,  90302 95
-  -               95 George Ainge, sweating on a stained bedsheet, smoking reefer, goofing on a  test pattern, randomly pulling at his dick
Walk by his window, he sees me, recognition kinks -- thinks this is a good sign
shoot him right through the glass
96
-
96 Bradley, roused from sleep, silk robe, coming down the stairs, his back door wide open
Reaches the landing, turns on the light
Feature me, this bobble-eyed ghoul, bloodying his settee look like something exhumed
His monogrammed serving napkins soak up blood from my knifed side
He startles school-girl
Throw the file at his feet: marred, mangled, stained
He inches forward, cinching his robe
Who
Fritz Koenig
120
(going pale) Where
Dead
Along with Wilhite, Junior
and Hector Magdalena
Why are you here
To collect
have the things you need to destroy Noonan's play
These same things can be used to destroy you
Bradley, prim, proper, even this early
He sits down across from me like some fucking Duke
Things like
Stemmons files
and Wilhite's body
He committed suicide after you subpoenaed him
This body is in your possession
Just nod
And it's what you need to burn Narco to the ground
but if those files and his body were to be given to Noonan and the Feds, with me providing the cherry-on-top testimony of a rogue cop
Well
The word `Cataclysmic' comes to mind
What will this cost
percentage of your Dodger Stadium stake in perpetuity
You buy my silence for a fourth of Hurwitz Holdings
Bradley scoffs, pithy smile
121
Doubtful
What'd you expect
stick-up
Empty your safe
'm about to disappear for good, and you're gonna fund my new life
You can't counter-punch out of this
Arrest me and  snitch the world
(point to the file) 'll hold that over your head for the rest of your life
Renege on our deal and it won't matter if it's tomorrow or ten years from now
'll fry you with that file
(at my cracked Hamilton) 'm officially outta time now Chief
Call it
Bradley: an actual, full-blown facial tic
His Adam's apple bobs as he realizes that he's finally been beaten
Wilhite's body
Bury it

'  -                                97 Cruising up the Topanga Canyon
Almost home

Knocking
Pete opens up
Standing drunk pissed-off nod
99
-                                    99 Liquor wafts off of him
You go to bed drunk, or just been up all night
No answer as  follow him into the house
Where's Glenda, is she asle- 122
-round the corner: Glenda shaking but refusing to cry
go pale: what is this
Somebody to the left, look: Milteer
Look back at Pete: tears in his bleary eyes as he crushes me with a right cross
(
) Seen Pete do this a dozen times and every time the same thought: God help me if he ever hits me like that
Instant-drop, moan
Glenda screaming
(') Don't kill me
Pete looks to Milteer, wipes blurred eyes
The harder you hit him the quicker say `stop' -- and cease that absurd crying
Pete bludgeons me
try to get closer to Glenda
Feel my nose shatter
Another swing: right cheek detonates
left hook to take advantage of my momentum: left eye explodes
Glenda's crying/screaming gets me madder than anything
(at Milteer) - -touch me and he dies
Pete knocks me down again
My face in pieces
(') Kick him-kick him-kick him
Pete hesitates, puts his boot into my guts: 1, 2, 3- (') (prim, official) -you may stop
(beat, for the room) Howard determined that this was the price for your time together
Milteer produces a Polaroid, takes a snapshot of my shattered husk, hands the camera to Pete on his way out: 123
You still have a job
Milteer gone
spit volumes of blood
'll talk with a slur for the next year
Pete reaches for me, blotto, sobbing
'm sorry Dave
Pushing out words past shattered teeth
put you here
that Powerhawk- -there's a body in the trunk- -burn it
Big drunk nod from Pete
Glenda panicking, trying to stanch blood that keeps rushing
Pete, reeling drunk, leans down, stuffs something in my jacket
'm so sorry

Almost painful
sit in the tub, let the shower rain down
Drain floods diluted red
Wash my wounds, my soul
So many bruises  look bubonic
My face still swelling, already purple-black
My left eye more than swollen shut
On the other side of the curtain: Glenda naked
Beauty that catches in my chest
Try to stand, turn my destroyed face
She gently pushes me back down
Sits into me, holds my face in both hands so that the water hits my lips
No nerves, no unease
Home
She closes the curtain
101
-                                      101 Post-coital
Both wide awake
Still scared
Let me take you to a hospital
We'd never make it inside
124
(big beat) 'm worried
'm through the worst of it
She frames my face with her hands
don't believe you
Lies will only leak, expose
The silence makes me just as guilty
She lets me off the hook, her head on my arm, leaning in
kiss her
(') (at a whisper) Was  worth this
Whatever the cost
Just like that then
Just like that
nod
An understanding
Another kiss, the last one 'll remember

Gauze over my left eye

103 Just sit and watch Glenda
Listen to her sleep: rhythmic breathing
The little natural smiling curl to her lips
Blonde hair splayed over white sheets
Touch her

Too many enemies
Too many ways for you to get hurt
Too close to me
a decision that will haunt me the rest of my days
The Gillette knife, fold it in a kerchief, gift-wrap it to Glenda
Place a letter under it on the night stand: (

Choke back tears as  lift Pete's camera and take the black and white picture you've seen before
Put my jacket on, pull the paper out of my pocket that Pete planted
a  Airline voucher

Past Cops and Feds camped out, looking for me

) Pete's penance beating built me a brand new face

-                                105 'm old
Stare at my leather-tan, once-broken face in a gilded mirror
The breaks occurred a lifetime ago, healed uneven
start to pack my suitcases
Old files you think you may have seen before
An old gun you know you've seen before
Movements slow and steady in my advancing age

) My will to remember
My confession complete
Still not enough

(
) (') Glenda: twenty-five years avoiding her name
Only a photograph, yellowed with years-passed, reminding me of everything  never was
(beat) Then a week-old Times at the place buy coffee
Her picture sees me before  realize she's looking
Her Face eternal-beautiful
Put her photo in my chest pocket
Push the week-old Times into a waste-basket: a Pan-Am ticket to  underneath

) and it asked me to revoke our time apart, redeem it
tell her anything
tell her everything
stand, shatter the mirror that reminds me of how long
And as  step out, an old man twenty-five years too late, and my -handsome, 1958 face smiles back at me through the shards
