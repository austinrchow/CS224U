href <b>// --> </b> Casino - Draft By Nicholas Pileggi ,  , 1983 - '' , a tall, lean, immaculately dressed man approaches his car, opens the door, and gets inside to turn on the ignition
(
) When you love someone, you've gotta trust them
There's no other way
You've got to give them the key to everything that's yours
Otherwise, what's the point
And, for a while
believed that's the kind of love had
Suddenly, the car explodes
Flames, smoke and metal rise into the sky covering the view of the Las Vegas casinos and their signs
Music in:
Bach - 'St Matthew Passion'
Ace's body comes flying in - extreme slow motion
His body twists and turns through the frame like a soul about to tumble into the flames of damnation
- Vignette of  through rippling flames, we move in on overseeing the casino
He lights a cigarette
(
) Before  ever ran a casino or got myself blown up, Ace Rothstein was a hell of a handicapper,  can tell you that
was so good, that whenever bet,  could change the odds for every bookmaker in the country
'm serious
had it down so cold that was given paradise on earth
was given one of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas to run, the Tangiers
/ ,   - Vignette of   sitting at a table surrounded by food and wine like the gods of Olympus
(
) by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars
don't know all the details
(
) Matter of fact
,   - Vignette of   standing at a bar with , his brother, and  , his right-hand man
(
) nobody knew all the details, but it should'a been perfect
mean, he had me, Nicky Santoro, his best friend, watching his ass
- Vignette of   a dazzling thirty-one-year-old blonde seated by a small fiery pool
(
) and he had Ginger, the woman he loved, on his arm
But in the end
/'  - looks over the casino he rules
(
) we fucked it all up
It should'a been so sweet, too
But it turned out to be the last time that street guys like us were ever given anything that fuckin' valuable again
- Aerial shot coming down out of the clouds over the brightly lit Vegas Strip and off into the blackness of the desert night
(
) At that time, Vegas was a place where millions of suckers flew in every year on their own nickel, and left behind about a billion dollars
But at night, you couldn't see the desert that surrounds Las Vegas
- Aerial shot swooping along the desert floor, then rising above the mist to reveal mountains in the distance
(
) But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved
(
) Got a lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes
Except you gotta do it right
mean, you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk
Otherwise you're talkin' about a half-hour or forty-five minutes of diggin'
And who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time
Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes
You could be there all fuckin' night
, 1973 - : ' ', ' ', '  ' is greeted by a casino exec and walked through the brightly lit entrance to the Tangiers Casino
(
) Who could resist
Anywhere else in the country,  was a bookie, a gambler, always lookin' over my shoulder, hassled by cops, day and night
But here, 'm 'Mr Sam Rothstein'
'm not only legitimate, but running a casino
And that's like selling dreams for cash
- We see  enter alone
He is greeted by
They are joined by top executives  and  in suits and ties
They walk through the casino, past crowded and noisy craps tables, spinning roulette wheels, blackjack tables, poker-faced players at poker tables, and elegant, cordoned-off, black-tie, baccarat tables
(
) hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and  went to work
(Introducing the to ) And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room
(
) For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins
It's a morality car wash
It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples
And, along with making us legit
/   - Dolly back from a wall of money
An employee pours a bucket full of coins into a trough
Camera follows progress as numerous coins move on a conveyor system, through a sorting machine
Camera reveals several rolls of coins on a lower conveyor as they move up a ladder towards an employee's hands, who then places the rolls on a rack
(
) comes cash
Tons of it
mean, what do you think we're doing out here in the middle of the desert
It's all this money
This is the end result of all the bright lights and the comped trips, of all the champagne and free hotel suites, and all the broads and all the booze
It's all been arranged just for us to get your money
That's the truth about Las Vegas
//   - Camera follows   carrying a small suitcase and walking through the casino to a door leading to the cashier's cage
The sign on the door reads 'Authorized Personnel Only'
He walks through the cage, to another door: 'Notice - Keep Out'
(
) We're the only winners
The players don't stand a chance
And their cash flows from the tables to our boxes through the cage and into the most sacred room in the casino
the place where they add up all the money the holy of holies
the count room
He opens the door
We see inside the count room from ' point of view
It looks like the area behind a teller's cage in a bank large room, windowless, decor-free
One side is a mesh cage, opened to reveal stacks of cash boxes
Several  in white shirts are gathered around a glass table counting and sorting paper money
) (
) Now this place was off limits
#1 Verify two thousand
(
) Even  couldn't get inside, but it was my job to keep it filled with cash
That's for sure
(
) They had so much fuckin' money in there, you could build a house out of stacks of $100 bills
And the best part was that upstairs, the board of directors didn't know what the fuck was going on
At one end of the room the clerks empty the metal boxes and rapidly count the cash at a counting table
The camera follows a cash 'drop box' being lifted from the stack by a clerk
He pours the cash on to the table and shows the empty box to a video camera
#2 rapidly counts the cash and announces: #2 Five thousand
(
) mean, to them everything looked on the up and up
Right
Wrong
The first counter recounts the cash
#1 Verify five thousand
(
) The guys inside the counting room
Stacks of bills lie nearby
The camera pans across the room to another table manned by a    who repeats the figure and writes it down on a master list
Five thousand
We move back to  opening a cabinet full of stacks of $100 bills
He opens his suitcase and begins to fill it with cash
As he does this, the workers studiously look in other directions
(
) were all slipped in there to skim the joint dry
They'd do short counts, they'd lose fill slips
They'd even take cash right out of the drop boxes
And it was up to this guy right here [], standin' in front of about two million dollars, to skim the cash off the top without anybody gettin' wise
the  or anybody
#1 Verify two hundred
closes the case and walks out
One of the counters dumps another container of money on the table
(
) Now, notice how in the count room nobody ever seems to see anything
Somehow, somebody's always lookin' the other way
Now, look at these guys []
They look busy, right
They're countin' money
Who wants to bother them
mean, God forbid they should make a mistake and forget to steal
Meanwhile, you're in and you're out
exits the count room and proceeds through the lobby of the casino, passing  and , to a side exit door
Past the jag-off guard who gets an extra c-note a week just to watch the door
mean, it's routine
Business as usual: in, out, hello, goodbye
And that's all there is to it
Just another fat fuck walkin' out of the casino with a suitcase
Now, that suitcase was goin' straight to one place: right to Kansas City which was as close to Las Vegas as the Midwest bosses could go without gettin' themselves arrested
leaves the casino and gets into a cab parked at the curb
- arrives
He is greeted by  , a gray-haired sixty-year-old underboss
: ' ' (
) That suitcase was all the bosses ever wanted
and they wanted it every month
Hey, John, how are you
How was your ride
,   - , with suitcase, and  leave the car and enter the produce market
(
) Now this old Mormon fuck here
: ,      ' ,   - and  walk through the grocery store, through the warehouse, past various employees to a doorway leading into the back room, where they are greeted by five older men around a large wooden table with bowls of macaroni and old jelly glasses filled with red wine
(
) he had to fly in with suitcases once a month, nice and easy
Somethin' smells good
Yeah, they made us somethin' to eat
(
) The bosses would come from all over the place: Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee
All over the Midwest
And they would meet in the back of this produce market in Kansas City
mean, nobody even knew
shakes hands with  , sixty-eight, a bald, affable Milwaukee entrepreneur and  , his thirty- year-old yuppie lawyer son
Camera continues to pan around the room
(
) One of the guys made his mother do all the cooking
On  , seventy-year-old Kansas City boss
Did you ever see that guy Jerry Steriano
On  , mid-seventies, an old-timer who once drove for Capone and is now Remo Gaggi's right-hand man
Jerry Steriano
Yeah
(
) Now, these old greaseballs might not look it, but believe me, these are the guys who secretly controlled Las Vegas
joins his  and  by a stove
' That man's here again
Piscano dips a piece of bread into a pot of tomato sauce
(
) Because they controlled the Teamsters' Union, and that's where you had to go if you wanted to borrow money to buy a casino
(
) When you've finished with him, want him
' (Carrying a plate of food to the table where  and are seated
) Here you are, gentlemen
(
) And nobody got a Teamsters' loan, unless the guys in this room knew they were gonna get their little suitcases
gets up from the table and walks toward
(
) Guys like this antique here [], out of Detroit
Or especially guys like Remo Gaggi, the outfit's top boss
embraces   who's seated on a couch, and sits across from him
You got a round figure on it
(
) Definitely the most important guy in this room
(Picking up the suitcase) About twenty pounds
So
That's around seven hundred thousand
Uh-huh, good
opens the case to reveal the money
(Off-screen, from following scene) know it's a little early for Las Vegas
/  - Camera tilts down a model of the Tangiers Hotel and Casino, then reveals the cover of Business Week magazine with a drawing of  , a young corporate type, smiling out under the headline: 'Philip Green, Vegas Wunderkind'
(
) but  do want to welcome the ladies and gentlemen of the gaming industry
On  , a middle-aged man at a podium giving a speech while , seated at a table, looks on
flash their cameras
and , sitting next to , also watch the photo op ceremony
(
) As far as the world was concerned Andy Stone, the head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, was a legitimate guy
This is a very auspicious occasion
(
) powerful man
Philip, if you would rise
Green stands up
(
) He even played golf with the President
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you
(
) But Andy also took orders
And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green
(Handing  a large cardboard facsimile 'check') this check for $62,700,000 for the new Tangiers
Thank you
(
) he did what he was told
, who is now the head of the Tangiers Hotel and Casino Corporation, is standing at the podium giving a speech
(
) Now here was the perfect front man
mean, what the fuck else could he be
He didn't know too much
He didn't want to know too much, especially that the bosses made the Teamsters lend him the money
He wanted to believe the Teamsters gave him all that fuckin' money 'cause he was smart
An exploding flash bulb fills the screen
say that, knowing full well just how much competition we have in this great city
- We see a  and a  swimming underwater
Camera reveals that they are in a motel swimming pool with glass portholes
Expensive cars are parked outside one of the rooms
Hoods stand around outside the door
(
) And where they got Green from - who the fuck knows
All  know is that Green was an Arizona real estate hustler, who barely had enough gas money to come and pick up his own fuckin' check
/  - We return to the press conference
Photographers snap away
In the background are six-foot blow-ups of the Business Week cover
The camera moves past ,  and several other men, past , to
(
) Now, all they needed was somebody they could trust to run the casino
And who better than Ace
mean, he was already in Vegas a couple of years and he had the fuckin' place clocked
- Camera looks straight down from the top of a hotel to a large pool area
(
) But typical Ace
/ - , in a bathing suit and robe, sits on a lounge chair with a telephone
, in sports clothes, sits on another chair
(
) give him a shot at runnin' a casino and he tries to talk you out of it
You know,  don't know if  could do this even if  wanted to
The Gaming Commission would never give me a license
have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me
You don't have to have a license to work in a casino
All you gotta do is apply for one
The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application
They got a ten-year backlog
But what happens when they do find out
Why would they want to find out
We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here
Why would they want to lock us out
And besides, they'll never find out
All you gotta do is keep changing your job title
Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman
And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile
know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license
(Exhales) It's a tough proposition, Andy
You, you know, if  did it, 'd have to run it my way
You got it
'm serious
No interference
Nobody's gonna interfere with your running the casino
guarantee it
Stone lights a cigarette
- blows on a die
(
) And that's how that got Ace to take over
's hands place the die into a micrometer
(
) They wanted him because Ace ate, slept and breathed gambling
Camera swish tilts up to , then swish pans to boxman, dealers and players watching him, trying to act calm
(
) They worked out a real cute job title too
We see the die in the micrometer
(
) Tangiers Public Relations Director
Satisfied the die is not loaded  sets it on the craps table, the camera cranes up to reveal the Tangiers Casino floor
(
) But the only thing he ever directed was the casino
He made his first bet when he was fifteen years old, and he always made money
But he didn't bet like you or me
is sliding chips, tossing them on to a craps table
(
) You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that
(Approaching the ) Where the hell did you learn how to deal
(He reaches down, stacking and arranging the chips
) (
) He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon
(To the chastised ) Place the checks properly
That's the way you do it
Yes, sir
(
) He had to know everything, this guy
Direct overhead tracking shot as  walks between two rows of gaming tables
(
) He'd find out the kind of inside stuff nobody else knew, and that's what he'd put his money on
/ ,  , - - walks past two boxers sparring in a ring, through a doorway into a room where several gamblers are seated around a table
(
) Even back home, years ago, when we were first hangin' out together
: ' ,  ' (
) he'd know if the quarterback was on coke
is looking at the odds board for college football games
The bookie,  , is waiting for  to hand in his picks
'll take Columbia for twenty
(
) If his girlfriend was knocked up
Twenty dimes on Columbia
As soon as  bets, a man erases a number from the chalkboard and replaces it was a '6', changing the odds
Two saunter from the room
(
) He'd get the wind velocity so he could judge the field goals
He even figured out the different bounce you got off the different kinds of wood they used on college basketball courts, you know
/    - The two  we saw sauntering out of the bookie joint are racing to the nearest public phones
Another  has already beaten them to it
(
) He'd be workin' on this shit day and night
There was nothin' about a game he was gonna bet that he didn't know
#1 (Into phone) Ace got down at six
#2 (Into phone) Charlie, hey
Rothstein got six
/ ,    - bookie hands a stack of money to another bookie, who hands the money to
removes several bills from the top of the stack of winnings and holds them out to the
(
) Season after season, the prick was the only guaranteed winner  ever knew
But he was so serious about it all that  don't think he ever enjoyed himself
But
exits
(
) that's just the way he was
- The room has an espresso machine and a saint's day calendar
Assorted hoods are listening to  at the bar
Camera dollies to  , at the rear table playing gin rummy with    and losing
Every time the  picks up a card, he's able to knock or get gin, sending  into a fit bemoaning his bad luck
(
) But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not
To them, he was a cash register
All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money
Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost
(Slams down his cards and curses at his losing hands) Ma che cazzo
[Italian-American slang for 'What a prick
'] All those fuckin' sweeps
(
) mean, unless Ace made his bet
That's enough now
can't contest the cards
Va fa 'n culo
[Italian-American slang for 'Fuck off'] (Summoning a young man
) Johnny
(
) Ace made more money for them on a weekend than  could do heisting joints for a month
enters and walks to 's table
(
) Whatever Ace picked up on the street he told Remo
(Walks over to and whispers) Hey, did you bring that thing
(
) You know,  mean fixed fights, doped horses, crooked fuckin' zebras
locked-in point spreads
He told fuckin' Remo everything
And to tell you the truth
don't blame him
stands up and shakes 's hand
Ace
(
) Keepin' Remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world
beams as  takes out an envelope filled with cash and hands it over to him
sits back down and , knowing his place, smiles and is about to leave
Son-of-a-bitch
How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan
Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi
How the hell'd you do it
Well, that's why they paid so well
You see
(Chuckles
) Never tells me nothin'
Ace, what do we got on for next week
Well, it's a little too early
'd say Thursday would be good
'll know by then
Is that all right
Okay
You come by the house
'll come by
Seven o'clock
Seven o'clock
gets up and kisses  as  and    look on
Good job, my boy
Keep it up
Okay, Ace
nods in agreement and leaves the room
(To ) Hey, Nick
Vien acca
[Italian- American slang for 'Come here'] (To ) 'll be right out
'aggia parla
[Italian-American slang for ''ve got to talk to you'] Nicky
See that guy
(pointing to the off- screen ) Mm
Keep a good eye on him
He's makin' a lot of money for us
And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him
Mm
Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that
without brains
Okay
All right
Uh-huh
Mi raccomando
[Italian- American slang for ''m counting on you'] Yeah
Fine
(Reaching down to touch 's money, joking with him
) Want me to take this for you
(He walks out
) (
) So, now, on top of everything else, gotta make sure that nobody fucks around with the Golden Jew
- We move past , a guy at the bar entertaining a and a , to  and   at the other end
There are other bar patrons in the background
(To the ) Chase, couple of shooters for the ladies
(
) All right
(
) Yeah, we made a great pair
made book and Nicky made sure we always collected
The old men loved us
And why not
They all made money with us
(To ) They payin'
(
) How did Nicky collect
They pay every week, like they're supposed to
(
) Don't ask
Then where the fuck is the money don't see the money
enters, and greets the two girls
Hi, Melissa
Heidi
Hi, Sam
(To the ) Who's this guy
(To ) Get the fuck out of here
It was nine
laid nine
approaches  and
It was eight
Ace
tell him the line on the Bear's game
Eight
If he don't know, nobody knows
Told you it was eight
Well, how come  laid nine
'Cause you're a jag-off
would have fuckin' made you lay ten
notices a pen lying on the bar
He taps  on the shoulder
(To ) Excuse me
What
(He holds up the pen) Is this yours
Your pen
Yeah, that's my pen
Why
ju- Well, it's a nice pen
just didn't know whose it was
thought it was yours
didn't want it to get lost
Well, thank you
Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off
looks over
Well,  was just offering you the- moves towards
(Turning his back to talk to the girls, referring to ) This fuckin' asshole
grabs the pen out of 's hand
#1 (To ) Look out
Before  can react,  grabs  and starts stabbing him in the neck with the pen
#1 Joe
Look out, Joe
Look out
grunts while  gasps and groans
The  screams while 's hand continues to plunge the pen into 's throat
tumbles to the floor
pounces on him, still stabbing and now kicking whimpers
What's that
You hear
You hear a little girl, Frankie
You hear a little girl, Ace
Is that a little fuckin' girl
What happened to the fuckin' tough guy
Told my friend stick it up his fuckin' ass
Huh
Huh
(Over whimpers and pants) Wait a sec, Nicky, Nicky, Nicky
Ta- take it easy
looks stunned
's still holding the bloody pen
(
) While  was tryin' to figure out why the guy was sayin' what he was sayin', Nicky just hit him
No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on
You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat
You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun
And you beat him with a gun, you better kill him, because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead
(
) Listen
, 1972 - Camera swoops from a woman cheering as she wins at a slot- machine to a blackjack table, then to a roulette table and over to a craps table
Montage of very short cuts of chips being picked up, dice thrown, money being poured from a bucket, stacks of money
(
) with me protecting Ace, he made a fortune for the bosses
mean that's what got him to Vegas
He was a money machine
tremendous earner for these guys
As soon as he took over, he doubled the fuckin' drop
With Ace the casino never saw so much money
And the bosses, they couldn't be happier
- Camera moves in on  as he looks out over the casino
Dealers deftly stack chips, scoop up losses and pay off winners
Chips and money are everywhere
In extreme close-up slow motion a die falls on to a table
-  - and  are walking down a casino aisle by the slot- machines
Dealers immediately snap to attention at their approach
(
) In Vegas,  had to keep a few juiced- in local cowboys working
They were close to the, you know, good old boys
(To ) Pay him six hundred a week, tell him to walk around and look smart
(
) mean, without us, these guys, they'd still be shovellin' mule shit
points at paper cups, empty glasses and the debris of silver dollar wrappings on the floor
, the Slots Manager in Western garb, immediately starts picking up the debris
looks at  sternly
Ward, you gotta keep a cleaner station
If you need 'Mr Clean', page him, all right
bends down and picks up some trash
It won't happen again, Sam
Mr Rothstein
(To ) Is this guy just another dumb fuckin' white man, or what
What's his story
We need this guy
We can't get rid of him
He's juiced in
He's the County Commissioner's cousin
wouldn't give the bum a mop job
They exit
- card shoe slides across the baccarat table
state , a little drunk, tips the dealer, kisses the blonder with him, fills his pockets with his winnings and walks over to see
(
) These yokels ran the state
#1 Thank you very much, Senator
(
) They passed the laws, they owned the courts
Hi, Ace
Hello, Senator
They shake hands
(To ) Hey,  need a room
Need a room
Good to see ya
(To ) William would you
The  shakes hands with  as the  joins them
(
) had dozens of politicians and state officials comin' through that place every week
Nice to see you, Senator
(To ) Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants
Certainly
(Leads the way
) Senator
(
) Why not make them happy
We have some nice penthouses you'll enjoy
Maybe the Presidential Suite
- The  unzips the 's dress, kisses her and walks through the bedroom doorway, looking over his shoulder to her as she takes off her dress and walks out of his sight
(
) For politicians
- smoking a cigarette by the baccarat tables
(
) like our state senator up there, everything was on the house
- The  opens a bureau drawer and takes out a small velvet pouch and pours black $100 into his palm
(
) These guys won their comped life when they got elected
So, hey, why not take advantage of it
Still, the politicians come cheap
We could handle them
,    - a Japanese businessman, and a male associate pick up towels and soap from about the bedroom of their suite
blonde woman checks herself in the mirror
(
) It's a whale like
Ichikawa, who plays thirty thousand dollars a hand in baccarat
That's the one you really gotta watch
and his associate walk into the the suite's living- room and join a Japanese woman seated on a couch
(
) He plays fast and big and he has the cash and the credit to turn out your lights
About a year ago, he cleaned out a couple of casinos in the Cayman Islands
They begin to stuff Tangiers soap and towels into their luggage
(
) Downstairs, he takes us for two million
and upstairs he takes free soap, shampoo and towels
Another billionaire cheapskate who loves his free rooms
,    - The Tangiers jet with the Tangiers logo on its side as shakes 's hands before boarding
follows him and his associates aboard
(
) free private jets, and two million of our money
Nice to see you again
(
) But we got him back
had our pilot tell him the plane was on the fritz
: ,      - apologizes to  and his entourage as they all get off the jet
Ken,  don't know what the hell went wrong
'm awfully sorry
This is a big problem
Big problem
can't understand it
These mechanical things, you know, they happen
Hey, be-better here than (gesturing to the sky) up there, you know what  mean
- arguing with   as  and entourage look glum
(
) Then he missed the commercial flights connecting with Japan
'm so sorry
There's a convention in town, and all flights are booked
convention
(Turning to ) can't believe that there's a convention
It's never
What can  do
- smiling  greets  and his entourage as they drive up and get out of Tangiers limos
(
) We got him back
with a whole floor of rooms for himself
'm sorry you missed the plane
You want to get my money back, right
(Chuckles) No, no, no
No gambling
No
- , with the Japanese woman, picks up some chips and places them on the table
and  watch from behind a barrier
(
) He bet one thousand a hand instead of his usual thirty thousand a hand
dealer's hands slide two cards on the table
The bank wins a natural eight over a five
Another dealer's hands place two chips on a table looks on
(
) But  knew, the trick with whales like Ichikawa was that they can't bet small for long
He didn't think of it as winning ten thousand, he thought of it as losing ninety thousand
places a larger bet
(
) So, he upped his bets
dealer picks up some chips from a rack and places them on the table
is now seated with stacks of chips in front of him
(
) until he dropped his winnings back and gave up a million of his own cash
: , hours later, his chips depleted
and still watch from behind the barrier as millions in chips are back in the dealer's racks
(
) In the casino, the cardinal rule is to keep them playing
Move in on  as he smokes a cigarette
(
) and keep them coming back
The longer they play, the more they lose
In the end, we get it all
- , with pit bosses next to him, looks out over the huge casino where hundreds of thousands of dollars are being poured into machines
(
) In Vegas, everybody's gotta watch everybody else
Camera reveals the  at a craps table
Six, an easy way
Six
All right, who's gonna give me
The  places some chips on the table
(
) Since the players are looking to beat the casino
both dice must hit that back wall each and every roll
All right, make a six
(
) the dealers are watching the players
Gimme a six
Come on, baby, make a six
, seated mid-table is watching the
(
) The box men are watching the dealers
(Humming, fielding, every roll
) , (
) The floor men are watching the box men
, (
) The pit bosses are watching the floor men
(
) The shift bosses are watching the pit bosses
(
) The casino manager is watching the shift bosses
(
) 'm watching the casino manager
(
) And the eye-in-the-sky is watching us all
: ---    - Video monitors show a dealer fanning a row of bills
Swish pan to  and  watching the monitor

(
) Plus

The crowd goes crazy

and a security man seated at a video console also look on
- craps stick pushes some dice towards
She rolls again, only this time she craps out
Gamblers groan, then applaud her
She's made so much money for the table that the winners toss chips in her direction

Get lost, Ginger
Get lost
Get lost
Yes
Get lost
Yes
knocks the chip rack out of his hands
Well, how 'bout that
Come on
(He bends down to pick them up
) Gamblers and dealers shout and yell
She picks up another rack of chips and tosses them into the air, then another, and another
Chips fly all over the casino
Everyone starts diving for chips
Dealers
Players
Security guards
Waitresses
Pit bosses
Bedlam
and the two execs with him are the only ones not diving for chips
He looks at
She looks at him
Slow motion:  smiles at  and walks off
(
) What a move

Close up of his hand attaching a diamond and ruby pin to her dress
Tilt up to 's smiling face beaming at

) But in Vegas, for a girl like Ginger, love costs money
They kiss
'm going to go powder my nose
( hands  a single $50 bill
She smiles coyly
He hands her another fifty
) (
) Ginger's mission in life was money
'll be right back
(
) (from following scene) See you, Ginger
-
- waves goodbye to the  and walks towards two who greet her warmly
She gets a bottle of pills from one of them and slips some cash into his hand in return
Okay, thank you for asking
(
) She was a queen around the casino
She brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money
(To  ) Hello
Hey, Ginger, how you doin'
Great
(Handing the some money
) And  have something for you
You got me covered
The   places a vial of pills in her hand
Yes
Something for you, there
And you do
Thank you very much
Take care of yourself
-
- hands the pills to   #2 in his hotel bathroom, where he is washing his face and trying to energize himself
got some lucky pills for you, honey
#2 Oh, yeah
(
) Who didn't want Ginger
She was one of the best-known, best-liked and most respected hustlers in town
Smart hustlers like her could keep a guy awake for two or three days before sending him home broke to the little woman and his bank examiners
- comes back from the ladies room
She kisses
Any change
(Chuckles) hit a few
uh, games on the way back
(
) That was all bullshit
She just pocketed the cash
-
'  - converts her chips into a pile of $100 bills
(To ) How you doin' tonight
Good
How are you
(Sighing) Oh, beat
(
) Ginger had the hustler's code
Okay
Take one for you
(While she counts out the cash) Thank you
(
) She knew how to take care of people
And that's what Vegas was all about

Thanks She picks up the cash
You're welcome
(
) It's Kickback City
You have a good night
Thank you
You too
Close-up of  folding a $100 bill and placing it in her palm
She slips the folded bill deftly into the palm of a floor manager
(
) She took care of the dealers
Hey, Mitch
(
) pit bosses, floor managers
Thank you
(
) But mostly
- , on her way out of the casino, passes a folded $100 bill to a smiling older
(
) she took care of the valet parkers, the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything
Thanks a lot
Thank you, Ginger
- exits and gets into her car, slipping a a $100 bill
(
) Ginger took care of the parkers because they took care of the security guards, who took care of the metro cops, who let her operate
#3 Thank you, Ginger
(Getting into her car) need that stuff tonight
#3 No problem
You're a doll
(
) The valet parking job was such a money-maker that they had to pay off the hotel manager just to get the concession
'  - enters the room with $25,000 in her hands
She taps 's leg with it and he turns to her
(
) But one thing  could never understand, was that she could have everything under control, except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond
Look, Gin, you know  got other people in this
got partners
But  want you to understand that  am lookin' out for you in this thing
Okay
You're going to get yours back
and you're gonna get it back first
Okay
All right
Okay
Yeah
Where are you goin'
Where are you
You're in that place
Where are you

No, you're not
Where are you
Where are you
'm always here for you
You are

He hastily kisses  and slips out the door
(
) The Ginger  knew wouldn't even look at this creep
Good luck
Yeah
(
) He was a moocher, a card cheat, a country-club golf hustler scumbag
chasing dentists for a few bucks
Careful
looks out of the window and sees  get into a convertible and drive off
(
) mean, the guy was always broke, he always had a story
And somehow, she could never turn him down
The way Ginger saw it,  guess, was that Lester was just an unlucky guy
Somebody had to take care of him
/ - , his wife , with a beehive hairdo, and their eight-year-old son  , are detained while their luggage is searched by a customs agent
: ' ' (
) But nobody had to take care of Nicky
(To customs agent) You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you
(
) mean, he took care of himself only too well
And that's why every badge back home wanted to nail him
(To customs agent) Excuse me, but  folded these things beautifully and  would appreciate a little respect
Jesus Christ
Don't look at me, pal
gotta live with her
We see  waiting for  outside the customs area
Two  push past him
(
) Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport
#1 (To ) Excuse me
(
) mean, Frank Marino was there to meet him, but so were the cops
This time they wanted to pinch him for some diamond burglary in Antwerp
'
Oh, yes
Will you help me fold these, please
(
) They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened
-
' /  - , ,   and  walk in
(To  ) You go and put your things away
(
) And they were usually right
,  and  are gathered around the kitchen table
leans over and starts to shake her hair
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Hold it, hold it
Here
places a red towel down on the table
leans over again, tugs and shakes her hair until diamonds begin to fall out of her beehive
(
) Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster, and he didn't give a damn who knew it
Come on
There we go
Look at that
Beautiful
Diamonds fall on the red towel in slow motion
(
) mean, that's what worried me, 'cause it turns out Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas
All right, we're clear
There's more
think that's it
There's more
There's a couple stuck in there
know there's more
God, 'm telling you, they're out
Come on, damn it
Don't get so defensive
It could be stuck in your hair, you know
grasps 's hair
Look, there aren't
( diamond falls out of her beehive
) There aren't but
Oh, there aren't
(Showing her the diamond
) What's that
(Slaps her
) Huh
What's that
( chuckles
) There's no more
Thanks, hon
/ - (
) couldn't wait to get my hands on Vegas
But the bosses didn't send me out there to have a good time
/ ,   - Mob bosses , , ,  and  seated around the back room table eating and talking as in the opening vignette
(
) They sent me out there to make sure that nobody fucked with Ace and
'  ,   - opens the door to  and
(
) nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim
(Opening door) Hey
Hey, how you doin'
(Kisses
) Hey
Hey, Sammy, how are you
and  take in 's spectacular Vegas-style penthouse
(Whispering) Wow
Boy, look at this place, huh
Incredible
All right
Welcome to Vegas
Okay, Sammy
Somethin', huh
Yeah
(Calling her over) Ginger
emerges from the bedroom
and  are both stunned by her beauty
(To ) Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here
Honey, come here
She walks to them This is Jennifer and Nick
They're dear friends of mine
(Shaking hands) Good to meet you
Hi, Jennifer
Pleasure
(Grasping 's hand and kissing it
) Very nice to meet you
Hi, how are you
Okay, Sammy
' ,    - and  are driving through town, the neon lights of Vegas reflected in the windshield
(
) After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk
And then
he hit me with it
What do you think about me movin' out here
( looks away
) What's the matter
You got a problem with that
No, of course not
(Playfully) You mean,  have your permission
Sure, you have my permission
But  - just gotta tell you it's no joke out here
It's no joke, you know
You gotta keep a low profile
It's not like back home
Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us
And this sheriff's a real cowboy
Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here
don't care
want to get away from back home for a while
'm tired of that shit back there
(Referring to the Vegas lights
) Look at this place
It's made of money
You know what the best part is
Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'
There's nobody here to see us
Everybody's back home
Nick,  gotta tell you,  got pinched twice for no reason
You really gotta be careful
'm running a licensed place
Everything's legit
Don't worry about it
'm not gonna do anything
What am  gonna do
'm especially not gonna involve you in anything
gives  a look
/
- and  pull up in their car and get out
(
) Ace saw Vegas one way
You call this guy and tell him 'm comin'
Of course
They walk into the sportsbook, past numerous bar patrons and gamblers to , the bookie at a betting counter
(
) But  saw it another
saw it as untouched
mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers  could shake down
Who the fuck were they gonna run to
So,  started getting everybody in line
Best of all, for the first time in my life,  figured out a way not to lose
(
) Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right
It wasn't very scientific but it worked
When he won, he collected
When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves
What were they gonna do
Muscle Nicky
(Chuckles
) Nicky was the muscle
grabs  by the back of his neck
Tony
Hey
How you doin'
How you doin'
All right, yeah
You got that thing for me
What thing
Oh, Nicky
thought you was layin'
was layin'
No, no, 'm taking it
was takin' it
You sure
'm positive
Well, 'm a little confused here
You're a little confused
Yeah
(Pointing to a window, above a counter with a tiny opening to talk through) Maybe if  stick your fuckin' face through this window over here like, you know, you'll - you'll get unconfused
Give me the fuckin' money
takes some money out of his coat pocket
(Groaning) 'm sorry, Nicky
didn't mean anything by it
Yeah,  know, that's why you had it ready
You thought  was fuckin' layin' it
He smacks the bookie on the head with the wad of money
(Gasps) My fuckin' head
Your fuckin' head, huh
Don't fuck around, Tony
(Pointing to ) Smarten up
(Walking out) You jag-off
(
) (From following scene) And now
- and  stand in the background with other parents listening to a  school teacher
and other youngsters are seated at small children's desks
Nicholas Santoro will come up and tell us about our first president
(Stepping up in front of the class to begin a speech) George Washington was born in a
(
) But still, it was nice and quiet for a while
Ginger and  presented Nicky and Jennifer all over town, like regular Ozzie and Harriets
typical Virginia farmhouse
- and    are coaching their sons
pats   on the back and with encouraging words sends him running on to the field
(To  ) Beautiful
You got a beautiful swing
(
) Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved with Little League, and it was great
Now,  want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay
'Cause that's what's gonna win this game
(
) Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'
Now go out there and show your dad what you can do
(
) metro intelligence cop
But it didn't matter
mean, it was all about the kids, you know
You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does
Yeah, well, that's exactly what keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born
It's instinctive, you know
He tries to do everything
hits the ball,  and applaud
Ohh
(
) And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known
'    - saunters through the casino and up to  and , two well-dressed hoods who are signing papers at the cashier's credit window near  and
(
) Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message
(
) Me
That's why the bosses sent me out here
They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint
Like these two fuckin' balloon-heads over here [ and ]
They were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand
(Chuckling
) Yeah, right, 'm sure
(Shakes 's hand) Hey, Nicky
How are you
Hey, Eddy
Hey, Nicky, how are you
What are you doin' here
'm over here now
/ (In unison) You're over here
You're over here
Yeah, 'm over here with him
Oh
Oh
We're waiting on Carmine
Yeah, we're lookin' for Carmine
Carmine
He was here before
saw him
He had a suitcase and everything, and then he left
Carmine left
Uh-huh
Carmine left
He's gone
He's not here
Carmine's gone
think, you know, maybe he went across the street or somewhere else or somethin'
don't know
Well, listen, uh
Good luck with the joint, huh
(Shakes hands with ) Oh, thanks, Eddy
(Shakes 's hand) Yeah, lots of luck
Lots of luck
Hey, great, Jerry
They walk away
Good luck to you too
(To  from behind the cage) Hey, they forgot to sign their papers
What
They forgot to sign their papers
Yeah, they don't need those anymore
He looks over to  and
smiles
(
) Out of respect, guys from other crews got away with a warning
taking a drag off his cigarette, nods an 'okay'
(
) Everybody else: watch out
/  - blackjack , who looks like a school teacher, with over $100,000 in chips before him has gathered a crowd
(
) Like these yokels here who never heard of Nicky or the bosses back home, 'cause they're the morons who give you the most trouble
Even after we'd catch 'em, they'd try sneakin' back with beards and wigs and fake noses
and  walk up to watch the  who is playing all six hands at the blackjack table
(
) You can spot these assholes by watching the way they bet
Like this guy
He's bettin' lavender chips at five hundred each with only one little problem
He's always guessed right
If he wasn't so fuckin' greedy, he'd have been tougher to spot
But in the end, they're all greedy
walks around the 's table, past the crowd, to the pit
Behind him are more blackjack tables, dealers and players
bends down and ties his shoelace
(
) saw that the dealer was weak, but he wasn't in on it
The 's hands lift the corner of his hole card a half an inch to determine the casino's hand against the
The slightly exposed hole card is a six of clubs
(
) He just wasn't protecting his hand
He was lifting his hole card way to high
'        ,    , , '    ' (
) Now, here's this guy
(
) reading the dealer's hole card
'
(
) and signaling his buddy [the ] at this table
We see through his trousers, that he is tapping a copper transmitter with a battery pack attached
Back at the 's table we see inside his pant leg where a device strapped to his leg is receiving the impulse signal - buzz - buzz - buzz - from the
(
) And that's just what these hustlers look for
They cruise from casino to casino, lookin' for weak dealers the way lions look for weak antelope
starts to get up

) (From following scene) Operator

This is Mr
Get me Armstrong and Friday over at pit two right away
He hangs up, and fixes his tie in the mirrored panel above the phone

They look towards the 's table

) Operator

On 's signal, , one carrying a cake with a sparkling candle, start singing 'Happy Birthday', attracting the crowd's attention
(In unison) Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday, dear Jeff
Happy Birthday to you
Gamblers cheer and applaud
nods and  lets a long metal object drop out from under his jacket sleeve and moves in close behind the , as though looking at the game
He presses the object - a cattle prod - under the 's arm near his heart
The  instantly goes into convulsions, falling to the floor gasping and groaning
Several   grab the  as he falls
walks away
#1 Man down
The  sees what happened to his partner
#1 Notify medical
We got a cardiac arrest here
#2 He's fine, folks
Just give us some room, please
watches the scene
The guards lift the stunned to his feet and help him away from the table
Play is immediately resumed
(
) Watch it now
The  hurriedly places his chips into racks
#1 (
) Stand back
(
) They never know what hit them
And if and when
drag the  out
(
) they do find out they just got zapped by a cattle prod
follows the  as he rushes away
(
) they wish they really did have a heart attack
exits behind the  and the
- grim, windowless utility room with tools on racks along the walls, some plain wooden chairs, and a workbench table
(
) Turns out this guy and his fuckin' pals, they were knockin' this place dead for years
#1 He's got a wire on him
The  is roughly shoved into the room tears his trousers down revealing the signaling device strapped to his leg
Hey, hey, what are you doin', man
#2 (Exposing the device) There it is
On the table
#1 Cheater's justice
The  is slammed down face first on the bench and the two  spread his arms out on the table
(In pain) Oh, God
Oh
Another  starts up a power saw and approaches the who is now pinned to the table
He starts to scream
Hey, no
No
No
walks toward the table, gesturing for the  to turn off the saw
(
) We had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over
(To relieved ) 'm just curious
saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand
Can you do that with both hands
No
Can't do it with both hands
No, Sir
Can you do it with your left hand
Well,

So, you're a righty
Ye-yeah

Instantly a large rubber mallet smashes onto the man's right hand four times to the sound of screams

Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand
God

Look what they did to my hand, man

You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here
You can't have both

The apartment looks out on the glittering neon signs of the Strip
(
) Within no time, everything was set in place
We got rid of the freelance scamsters
The per was way up
The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be
And ,  decided to complicate my life
For a guy who likes sure things,  was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot
We're not getting any younger
Don't you think it's time
Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit
Bangin' around, hustlin' around
What, are you trying to handicap me
'm gonna do you one better
'm trying to marry you
You want to marry me

You don't know me
What, you've known me, two, three months
What do you know
'm forty-three years old

You know a lot of happily married people, Sam
'Cause  don't

that can grow as  - as long as there's a mutual respect
that kind of thing can grow
'm realistic
can accept that
But, you know, what is
What is love anyway
It's a
it's a mutual respect
It's - it's a devotion
It's a
it's a caring from one person to another
And if we could set up some kind of foundation
based on that mutual respect
feel that eventually you would care enough about me
that  could live with that
If it doesn't work out
You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me
You know 'm doin' well now
And 'm gonna do even better
And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, 'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life

(Laughs) 'm not crying
(Sniffs
) walks up behind
Maybe you shouldn't drink so much

They are reflected in a mirror behind the telephone
Want to go
Let's go back in
(Sniffs) Okay
's hands pick up a white rose and 's gloves from the desk
'  - and  drive up to an expensive house which backs on to a country-club golf course
'  - takes  inside
It is fancy and lush
Oh
Through sliding glass doors, we see a patio and a pool area
(Sighing) It's great
The living-room has exposed white brick along the walls, bronze ostrich figurines, a white baby grand piano, and a zebra print rug surrounded by a few couches
Oh, it's great
'   - takes  past the bedroom to their huge room-sized closet
There are racks and racks of clothes
(Running into the closet) Oh
It's all my stuff
Oh, my God
presents her with a long chinchilla coat
You brought all my stuff
can - She sees the coat
Try it on
It's yours
He puts it on her
(Whispering) You're kidding
My God
What is it
It's chinchilla
(Looking at herself in the mirror) Oh, it's so soft
It's nice isn't it
Oh
Kisses her
No one's ever been so nice to me
They kiss and embrace
' / - 's hand opens a leather case full of gold Bvlgari jewelry
(Gasps) Oh, my God
' / - and  lie on the bed, surrounded by jewelry is swathed in the chinchilla coat
Ace watches as a transfixed tries on gold necklaces, rings, bracelets and earrings
So, do you think it's too much if wear these in the same day
You do whatever you want
Do  keep my promises, or do  keep my promises
kisses
You're so wonderful
The jewelry's not so bad, either
The only thing is
you shouldn't keep this in the house
We gotta put it in a bank
(Putting on a gold bracelet) Come on
Can  keep this one in the house
Now look, (gently holding her face, gathering her total attention) pay attention to me
What 'm gonna tell you is very important
Okay
All this stuff doesn't mean anything
Money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust
have to be able to trust you with my life
- : ' ' and  get off the Tangiers jet carrying two suitcases
gives a chauffeur the luggage and follows into a brown Rolls Royce
(
) With over a million in cash and jewels tucked in a bank in Vegas only for Ginger, she was secure and happy
- and  walk into the bank lobby carrying the suitcases
(
) She loved that shit
But a guy in my line of work has to have a lot of pay-off cash around
/ - There are several safe deposit boxes filled with cash and  are closing a large box so crammed with cash that has to lean on it for the clasp to lock
(
) Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks
Need a little help with that, Mr Collins
(
) So,  put two million in cash in a Los Angeles bank under the name of Mr and Mrs Tom Collins
This was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money
and  struggle to push the crammed box into a slot in the wall
(
) And, since 'd either be in jail or locked in a closet when  needed the money the most
The   joins them, and he and  simultaneously double-lock the outer safe box door with two separate keys, after which,  gives  his key
(
) gave Ginger the only key to the cash that could get me back alive
'  - is on the other side of a glass wall, signing papers
Now this is just a signature card
So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box
No one else, including myself
That's right
We see  looking at
That's the way you wanted it, right
nods (Quietly
) Sam, let me ask you a question
You must really trust your wife
(Quietly) Yeah, sure  do
Why
No, tha-that's good
It's just unusual
To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't
Well
looks over to , smiles and winks
She looks back at him
- sings to a seated audience
sits alone at a table
(
) With Ginger and the money in place, felt covered, and to play it safe switched job titles again and made myself, um, Food and Beverage Director
This way nobody would bother me about a license
mean, Vegas was like a dream for me
Trouble was
is seated at another table with , peeling off money and giving it to , a crooked dealer
(
) Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas
(
) To begin,  put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week
You know - juice to the fuckin' dealers
(To ) Don't make us come lookin' for you
Oh, you won't have to look for me appreciate it
Thanks, Nicky
All right, Mike
gets up from the table
(
) They were degenerate gamblers, coke freaks
In no time,  had half the dealers in the Tangiers in my pocket
Then
- is at a table with his gang of card sharks: , , and , all secretly signaling each other, sandbagging a mark
, the crooked dealer from the previous scene, deals  a winning hand
(
) the next thing  did,  started bustin' out high-stakes poker players
(
) It was so obvious
mean, all of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy
(Scratching his arm) 'm gonna open for five hundred
Moosh, you open
(Taps his fingers on some chips before picking them up
) (
) Signaling back and forth
bet thirty-five hundred
wiggles a toothpick back and forth in his mouth
've been losing for three days straight, non-stop
Another shark pulls on his ear
Oh, why're you crying, with three loaves of bread under your arm
watches their signals with concern
(
) Nicky thought nobody was watching him
But he was wrong
We see two undercover gaming agents, looking like tourists, sneaking looks at 's table
(
) And  didn't want any of those agents near my place
Four aces, Doc
His hands spread five cards on the table, showing four aces
What do you got
(Getting up in disgust) Jesus Christ
can't believe it
, the card shark with the cowboy hat, rakes in a large pot toward his side of the table
If  didn't have bad luck,  wouldn't have any luck
'm out of here, you understand
(
) mean,  wished to God Nicky and his whole crew would just get lost
He walks towards 's table
(
) What am  gonna do
Go back home and start a war
leans down to talk to
(
) mean, Nicky's a made guy and 'm not
can't do that
(Whispering in 's ear) Be careful
Gaming agents are all over the place
So, 'm lucky
'm not allowed to get lucky in this place
You been lucky all week
They're lookin' to nail ya
walks away
looks over at the gaming agents
(
) Ace was so fuckin' worried about his casino, he forgot what we were doin' out here in the first place
- Security people are pulling apart a husband and wife who are fighting
Camera picks up  as he passes by them
(
) million times  wanted to yell in his fuckin' ear: 'This is Las Vegas
We're supposed to be out here robbin', you dumb fuckin' Heeb
' - Closeup of the 's white-socked feet with no shoes on a poker table

You understand
(Slapping him
) Go over there and apologize
(Kicking the chastened away
) Go
Get the fuck out of - Nicky, 'm sorry
- tiger leaps towards the camera, which pans over to two showgirls and then to 's hand holding the key to a Rolls Royce
He gives it to  and  as reporters rush in to photograph the moment
(
) You know, Ace could be a very touchy guy, especially when he got bigger and bigger in town
Like when he hired that Jonathon and David and their tigers away from the Palace by buildin' them a new stage and then givin' them a silver Rolls Royce
- and  watch as a   weighs in the 'Femme Fatale' Showgirls
(
) But 'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds
He knew all the fuckin' angles
He brought over the whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris
But he forgot how lazy them European dancin' broads can get
mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons
(To ) You're still eight pounds over
(To
) What's the reason for this
Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension
Never mind the 'sir'
Never mind the 'sir'
Well, sir,  was just
Why is she eight pounds over
trying to offer you the respect that your
position
'Mr Rothstein' is good enough
Mr Rothstein
well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows
She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter
Listen
and she doesn't always - all you do is give me answers
Just - just give me the right answer
But, sir
Well,  don't know why guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired
That's right
She will get fired
In fact,  want you to send her back to Paris
It's always been our policy - No
Just stop everything
and  walk away across a huge stage
(To ) This woman's an institution
don't care what she is
She's an institution, that's the problem
She's lazy
- standing in a large space surrounded by giant  screens showing sports events
Around him, long rows of bettors are seated at betting stations, lined up at windows, or wandering around at the bar
It's like a  control room on launch day
(
) Hey,  gotta give the guy credit
He does the most obvious thing
This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why not take advantage, right
So
he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino
Well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every casino on the Strip trying to copy off him
(
) Between
- , with , punching and kicking a man next to the open door of his luxury car
(
) my innovations
The man falls to the ground
(
) and Nicky's dedication to his job
starts kicking him
(
) soon had the best operation on the Strip
lifts an empty trash can and shatters the car's windshield
- and  are standing on the casino floor near the slot- machines
Gamblers are milling about behind them
You better watch yourself
There's a lot of heat on you already
Why, somebody's complaining
'm - 'm hearin' things from security
They're all ex-cops
The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls
They want to put you in the Black Book
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit
They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone
Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble
You will not be able to walk into the casino
'm tellin' you
What am  doin' out here
'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all
'm just tellin' you
Don't say didn't warn you

She holds up a necklace to the light
Look at this

Loose machines are right back over there

Bring 'em up here where they belong
You can't even see 'em over there
Okay, 'll - What about the progressives with the high jackpots
Where are they
These machines are hidden
Well
These are our best machines
They bring all the action
No wonder the drop is off
Yeah, okay
The action is in the front, not in the back
Bring 'em up front
All right,  will,  will
Listen to me very carefully
There are three ways of doing things around here
The right way, the wrong way, and the way  do it
You understand

(Chuckles) Well, you might as well get somethin' out of it
lights a cigarette
- Wide overhead of roadhouse cafe isolated in the middle of the desert with a sign out front that reads '60 miles to Vegas'
(
) Well, it wasn't long before what was afraid was gonna happen, happened
Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, and from then on,  couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or even near it
(From inside the diner) What the fuck is that supposed to mean
- and  are seated at a table in the empty diner
(Reading from a document) '
detrimental to gaming
And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas
and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up
' (He waves the document
) Do you believe this shit
(Smoking a cigarette) Yeah,  believe it
You got banned
hisses
(Reading) 'Who is of notorious and unsavory reputation
' He angrily wads the document and tosses it across the table
Motherfucker
Unsavory fuckin'
Is there any way around this
Nope, there's no way
Let's say
for instance
want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino
to get one of those sandwiches  like
Forget it
You can't even set foot in the parking lot
That's how serious it is
In other words, 'm fucked
In so many words, yes
(
) It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant
Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and  agent in the state
mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone
But Nicky didn't care
gotta do somethin'
gotta do somethin'
They ain't gettin' rid of me
They're not gettin' rid of me
'm staying here
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em
' - , (       ) -  ' (
) So, once they pulled that shit, started doin' my own things in Vegas nobody ever thought of doin'
To keep an eye on things,  brought in my kid brother Dominick
and some desperadoes from back home and started knockin' over high rollers, casino bosses, bookmakers, anybody, right here in town
had a good fuckin' crew goin' for me, 'll tell you that
,   and   are getting out of a car and walking into the jewelry store which is designed to replicate an old-fashioned Western town with peaked roofs, wooden planked sidewalks and hitching posts
The camera tracks by each man as they're introduced
(
) had Sal Fusco, a great second-story guy
Jack Hardy, he worked for a safe company after he did a six-year bit
And then there was Bernie Blue
This guy could bypass any alarm for me
And  opened up my own jewelry store, too: 'The Gold Rush'
- places some jewelry from a vanity table into a sack and turns over some family photos
and  are struggling with a safe
(
) Sometimes  used to go along on a heist just for the fun of it
But didn't like the people  was rippin' off lookin' at me, so  used to turn their fuckin' pictures around
(To  and ) What's takin' so long over there
This peter's a motherfucker

All right
(
) And they all
/  - and a hood are in a van parked in front of a warehouse next door to a jewelry store
(
) got a piece of the score
(From inside the van, into a walkie-talkie) Car's comin'
We move past the van to a larger truck parked in an alley
Unseen, the truck has an open side door abutting the jewelry store's wall
and   are inside the truck drilling into the wall using a heavy-duty battery-powered drill
The drill is muffled with sheets of insulation material
(
) They were always very careful
And they always bypassed the alarms, or else
if not, they'd drill enough holes to knock through the walls with a sledgehammer
widens the hole with a hammer muffled with insulation
- flashbulb explodes
Cops and detectives are photographing and inspecting holes drilled in the wall of the shop, through which the thieves have come and gone
The camera moves in through the hole
(
) Nobody out there was expecting a guy like him
- The stunned   looks at the rubble and the empty jewelry boxes
Detectives collect evidence
(
) For Nicky, Las Vegas was the fuckin' Wild West
(Leading a detective to his showroom) just got a shipment of diamonds from Israel
(
) But what the fuck they expect from me
had to earn, didn't
- stands above two  who are looking at the stolen gems
#1 You know, this diamond has flaws in it
No, no, there's no flaws in it
#2 Don't tell me
'm doing this for twenty-five years
You better clean your fuckin' loupe
'Cause there's no flaws in these diamonds
The two  speak to each other in Farsi
(
) Whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to Palm Spring or Arizona
had a couple of sand niggers out there
You know, Arabs
What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds
#2 (Chuckling) No, no
know his language
'm talking with him
Forty thousand dollars, you can buy the whole package
#1 Twenty thousand, and that's my final offer and
(To  #2) All of a sudden he talks English, now
(To  #1
) Let's talk turkey here, how 'bout twenty-five thousand
#1 laughs
'  - and  sneak into the house past  who is asleep on the sofa in front of a  set
takes out a key and opens the metal door into his bedroom
(
) actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where  kept the choice stuff
(Referring to as they pass the kitchen) She asleep
Every night, on the couch
(
) couldn't leave it at the Gold Rush in case we got raided by the cops
or if my crew got cute
Opening the metal door to his bedroom
(
) had the only key
' / - Camera pans across bedroom to closet door
(
) Jennifer didn't give a fuck
She used to fall asleep on the couch watchin' television every night
This stuff was all mine
didn't send any of this back home
opens the closet door
He and  walk in and bend down to lift up a small square of carpet to reveal a floor safe
(
) Actually,  couldn't because  wasn't even supposed to be doin' it
The bosses were makin' so much fuckin' money with the casinos (unlocking the safe) that they didn't want anybody makin' any waves for them
In the floor safe, there are several handguns and silencers
hands  a roll of money
Give all the guys in your crew a piece of that
took care of everybody
Yeah
He searches 's jacket
(
) That's why there was no real organized street stuff in Vegas before  came here
throws the cash in the safe and closes the lid
'  - is being shown papers by  , a heavy-set banker with a moustache
They're both seated at a table in the living-room
Yeah, that works out
(
) But how much cash could  bury in my closet, right
You need to understand, and  - 'm sure you do
that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss
Oh, listen,  understand that there's always a risk
you know,  might have to take a loss somewhere
(
) So  put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark
He was Ace's banker
mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark
Yes
Well, you gotta understand, 'm giving you fifty thousand cash
chuckles (
) Then  put some more of the money
,  - prosciutto sandwich is being prepared on a kitchen counter
(
) in some legitimate places, like my restaurant
(To  preparing sandwich) Is that the last one
Yeah
He hands the sandwich to  who spits in it
(
) had my kid brother, Dominick, run it for me
(Spits) Fuckers
wraps it in plastic and puts it into a brown paper bag
- sets the bag with the wrapped sandwich in it on top of pizza boxes being held by two uniformed Vegas
Here you go, guys

Hey, how you doin'
walks over to some patrons in the bar area enters, kissing his brother
(

It was a very popular spot
He had politicians, showgirls and movies stars hangin' out all over the place

And you can always tell a great kitchen like ours because of the milk-fed veal
That's the secret
Opening the car door from the passenger's side, she gets in
See, milk-fed veal is pure white
Out here, they got that pink veal
Slide over, honey
She slides over, he gets into the passenger's seat and closes the door
Now, pink veal, you can pound that shit for two days and it'll never get tender, you know what  mean
's head disappears into 's lap
- and  are at the bar watching as  chastises , a gambler
The restaurant is empty except for a waiter milling around in the background, setting a few tables
When  left here with the money

That's what  did

(
) - no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky- Boy
(Pouring some syrup on his son's pancakes) Here, let's put a little of this on for you

(
) Every couple of weeks  used to send Marino back to the bosses with a piece of what  made
: ' ' walks out of the office and through the garage
(
) Not a big piece, but fuck them, what did they know
They were fifteen hundred miles away
-  ,   - Wide shot of gas station
There is snow on the ground
The cloudy, Midwestern skyline of warehouses and skyscrapers can be seen behind the gas station sign: 'All-American Gas'

Their drop was a truck stop/garage where

Remo
He bends down and kisses him
Hey, Frankie
How are you
Fine, fine
(
) mean, the cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck
mean, you know, they all worked it out together
Nicky sends his warmest regards
unzips a small sack and hands  a thick stack of cash
inspects it before handing it over to one of his men
Uh-huh
Good
(
) But  knew how to keep the bosses happy
Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message,  would carry things out
And how are things going down there
Fine
Everything's goin' good
(
) to a tee
Like the time Tony Dogs
- Flash cut of   and two men shooting up a bar with automatics hitting the owner, bartenders and a waitress
(
) who was supposed to be the new maniac tough guy in town, shot up one of Remo's bars
Here's a fuckin' guy, kills two of Remo's guys and a poor fuckin' waitress, who was just workin' on her night off, of all things
(
) mean, this guy's just beggin' to be made an example of
The men and the waitress lie dead on the floor
The bar is left in shambles
(
) (From his office) Frankie
-  , '   - An enraged  gives  orders
want all the names of all the other people he had with him
And don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em
You understand

[Italian-American slang for 'Now, go
'] - ,   - and  are dragging  , who is beaten to a pulp, across the floor towards a workshop table
follows them
(
) To be truthful with you,  had to admire this fuckin' guy
He was one of the toughest Irishmen  ever met
This fuckin' guy, he got some stamina, don't he
(
) This son-of-a-bitch was tough
Personally,  don't give a fuck who was with him anyway
As long as he gives me a name  could give to them
(
) For two days and two fuckin' nights, we beat the shit out of this guy mean, we even stuck ice-picks in his balls
You better hope he gives me a fuckin' name soon, or 'm gonna give him yours, Frank
and  lay  on the table and put his head in a vise
They're exhausted from beating him
(To ) Yeah, thanks a lot
(
) But he never talked
(To ) know you would have ratted by now
(
) In the end,  had to put his fuckin' head in a vise
Dogs
Dogs, can your hear me, Dogs
gasps and mumbles
Listen to me, Anthony

Two fuckin' days and nights

Fuck me, you motherfucker
(Turning the vise
) Fuck my mother
That's what you fuckin' tell me
angrily keeps spinning the vise handle until suddenly one of 's eyes bulges out of the socket
Huh
You motherfucker, you, huh
and  are horrified by the sight
Everybody freezes
Oh, God
Give me the fuckin' name
Ch-Charlie

(Screaming) Charlie
You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit
Charlie You dumb motherfucker
(Pleading) Kill me, you fuck, kill me
Kill you, (unwinds the crank) You motherfucker you
(To
) Frankie, do him a fuckin' favor

) The word got around that finally
places a knife against 's neck
(

Nicky was the new boss of Las Vegas
We hear  gasp as the knife slices his throat

Four reels with sevens across
Suddenly, the power goes out
Lights die down
Machine 'waaaooows' down to a dead stop
Security guards, on their hands and knees, are pulling the plugs on the three giant $15,000 progressive machines, as talks to
Four reels, sevens across, three fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots
Do you have any idea what the odds are
Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more
Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes
Why didn't you pull the machines
Why didn't you call me
Well, it happened so quick
Three guys won
didn't have a chance to call you
You didn't see the scam
You didn't see what was goin' on
Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam
Yes, there is
An infallible way
They won
Well, it's a casino
People gotta win sometimes
Hey
Ward, you're pissin' me off
Now, you're insulting my intelligence
What do you think, 'm a fuckin' idiot
You know goddamn well somebody had to get into those machines and set those fuckin' reels
enters, stands next to
The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one
On three machines in a row, it's in the billions
It cannot happen
would not happen, you fuckin' momo
What's the matter with you
Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win
really think you're - (Interrupts) You - Wait
You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win

Get your ass and get your things and get out of here
You're firin' me
'm firin' you
No, 'm not firin' (mocking ) 'm firin' you, you - Gives  a look
You might regret this, Mr Rothstein
'll regret it even more if  keep you on
This is not the way to treat people
Listen, if you didn't know you're bein' scammed, you're too fuckin' dumb to keep this job
If you did know, you were in on it
Either way, you're out
Get out
Go on

This is his state
His uncle's Chief Judge
His brother-in-law runs the County Commission

There's gotta be a way to work him back in
Phil,  can understand
You're in the finances, you're upstairs, but you are not on the floor

They're all lookin' to rob me blind, twenty-four hours a day

Well,  mean

You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know

'm aware of that
We don't have to turn this into a big deal
(Getting up to the refrigerator
) Okay
We don't have to have a fight
It was important to me
But forget it
Just something  wanted to do for myself
Who's fighting
mean, 'm, you know, tell me what it's for

Why can't you tell me what it's for
She stirs her coffee
Huh
(Pause) Well, you know what
Now,  want you to tell me
mean, my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand
mean, what do you want
Do you want a coat
No
Well, if you want a coat, you got it
You know that
It's not the money, it's just why do you want it
That's all 'm askin'
Am  not entitled to that
Look - Sam, 've been independent my whole life

Now you're making me beg you for this
What are you talkin' a-
(Interrupting) Okay

Why do want to make me feel so bad
You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand

The thugs follow him out of the back door

She takes a pill with a drink
So, why'd he have to do that, huh
She walks towards , who is sitting on a couch across the room

That's all
'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more
(Sniffs
) Well, there you go
But what does that tell ya
million dollars in jewelry
Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what

He's a Gemini
triple Gemini

(Breaking down
) Gemini's the snake
You know you can't trust the snake
(Sniffs
) mean it

But, you know, think you should try to make the best of it now
Go slow, you know
See what happens
He could have killed him
Okay
He could have killed him
She gets up and walks to the counter by the mirror
He didn't have to hit him
It's not exactly like 'm sleepin' with the guy
And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends
What the fuck is that all about
Well,  guess it's 'cause he loves you so much
He's jealous and worried

And take it easy with this shit, will you

(Fidgeting with his jacket, then holding his face in her hands, smiling
) You're so nice
(She begins to cry
) Come on, now,  don't want to see you unhappy
She kisses him
(Tenderly strokes his head) Thanks
Yeah
She embraces , wrapping her arms around him
(Through tears) Thank you
(Feeling a little awkward with the hug) It's all right
She kisses him again
doesn't move, holding back
'  - Pull back from a sign, with a tiny 'yes' on top of a gigantic 'no', leaning on a window overlooking the sportsbook
We see , behind his desk, taking a swig of Mylanta
His telephones
'  , '  - We see past  's cowboy hat down onto Ace's on the phone
(Into telephone) Mr Rothstein
County Commissioner Pat Webb is here to see you
(Over telephone) Okay
'  - (Into telephone) give me a minute
(Over telephone) Okay
hangs up the phone
'  , '  - (To ) It'll just be a minute
'  - gets up from his desk and we see he is in his boxer shorts
He opens the closet and carefully puts on the trousers hanging inside
'   - very patient  is leaning against some double doors across from Ace's
Mr Webb
Can  get you anything
Oh, no
(Cordially tipping his hat
) No, thank you, little lady
'  - (Into telephone) Okay, send him in and call me four minutes after
walks in
He is big, tough and western, wearing a Stetson, tooled boots, jeans, an elbow-patched jacket and a turquoise bear claw string-tie
His headband contains a rattlesnake head
Ace's  shuts the door on her way out
Mr Rothstein
(With hand outstretched to
) 'm Pat Webb
How do you do
They shake hands
Hey, it is my pleasure
Yeah,  heard a lot about you
Oh, thank you, sir
Looking out Ace's office picture window overlooking the sportsbook
Hey, house is doin' well
(Chuckling
) Hey, all that money is rollin' in appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant
No, that's quite all right
'     ' Why don't you have a seat
Hm
Oh
Thank you, sir
sits down in a chair in front of 's desk
Uh,  come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter
See, uh, maybe you didn't know it, but, uh, Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town
He's got lots of friends here
Now, his family and their money go back many, many years
Now, friends vote
family and money votes
That's important to me
and you
And if you'll think about our little problem along them lines
and you forgive me for sayin' it, maybe he did not deserve to be fired
'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it
That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on
Either way,  cannot have a man like that workin' here
Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges
Believe me, if  could prove it, he would be under arrest
Are, uh - (Clears throat
) - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro
think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that
What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise
went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid
He's weak, he's incompetent
He jeopardizes the whole place
There's not much more can do for him
(Chuckling) You have got me there
Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar
(Chuckles
) But, he is my brother-in-law, and would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back
can't do that
And  appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and  do want to help you and like to do favors, and  know who you are, but  cannot do that
Well, could there be any position
further down the trough
(Pause) 'm sorry,  can't do anything
He's too incompetent
And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted
The telephone rings
picks it up
(Into telephone) Okay, thanks
(To
) Um
you know, that's it
'm sorry
Mr Rothstein
Your people never will understand the way it works out here
You're all just our guests
But you act like you're at home

But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor
(Pause
) Thank you for your time
No problem
(Getting up and shaking hands
) Sorry
(Smiles slightly) You bet

What happened to my pills
He leaves the bathroom and walks into the bedroom where is stretched out on their imperial bed
Huh
(Waving the pill bottle) Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too

Look - for my ulcer,  take a half a one of these, a half a one of these
And that's when  have extreme pain

It's not like 'm sleeping with the guy
Yeah, how do  know
(Sobbing) You can't make me stop caring

She starts to cry
(Trying to calm her) Listen
(Stepping up to the bed

Uh,  mean

don't give a shit
'm gettin' out of here
(Crying
) am
She sits up woozy, and tries to pull on her trousers
(Walking around the bed to her) It's okay
Look
(holding her face, gently) you gotta get a hold of yourself
Okay
If not for me, at least for Amy
(Sobbing) Okay, okay
(Gently) You understand
Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand
'm gonna get you into a program
They got plenty of good ones
don't need one
Yes, you do
It's very discreet
There's no names in the papers
You don't have to worry about any of that stuff
That's all you care about
(Collapsing on the edge of the bed
) You don't care about me at all
(Bending down to her) Yes,  - yes,  do
No, you don't
How could you say that
You're a beautiful woman
You're destroying yourself
You don't need that stuff
You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you
know you better than you know yourself
You're a tiger, you're stronger than  am
And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody
(Strokes her hair
Then, quietly:) You can do it
(Kissing her
) You can do it
(Sobbing) Oh, God
Oh, God
Okay
Okay

Know what my problem is
Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too
How the fuck does that help mean, the heat he brought down is murder
We had a police department who was cooperative
He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore

Maybe he should
get lost for a while
Take a vacation
Would that be so bad
They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere
All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver

You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me

Oh, sure
Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it
No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did  tell you

' good evening
Signora
Gino
' This way
(
) (as they are led to their table) The good part was,  had Amy back
So, we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed, calmed myself down and we went to dinner
tried to keep things nice and civil, you know
But
hey, twenty-five thousand for three suits
That doesn't make much sense
(Seated across from at a booth) First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits
But let's say he did, which he won't
How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days
, um,  mean, how could you get fitted that fast
can't get fitted that fast, and  pay twice as much
bought him a watch too
Yeah
Yeah
But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand
Yeah
At the most, which is impossible for him
She glances to the table behind them
Plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece
That still leaves what
Around ten thousand
(Staring down at her plate, trying to restrain herself) Would you knock it off, Sam
'm just tryin' to figure it out
There's nothin' to figure out
'm home
we're workin' it out
She lights a cigarette
Yeah, but 've been told that before, 'We're workin' it out
' You think that you're home
after what you just put me through with Amy, is a favor to me

On my money
You might as well have fucked him, which you probably did anyway

Good fuckin' actress

You always thought was, but 'm not
And 'm not a sucker
That fuckin' pimp cocksucker
He's lucky  didn't kill him last time
Lucky he's fuckin' livin'
And if you would've stayed with Amy

Both of you

(Sobs
) She drives off

He hears a car turn into his driveway
He sees the car's headlight beams (
) The funny thing was, that after all that
didn't want her to go
She was the mother of my kid
loved her
And later
realized  didn't want to give her the money, because if  did
knew 'd never see her again

Hm
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass
(Chuckles) Yeah, right
That's Sammy
And he's probably got it there too
Takes a sip of his drink
He's so fuckin' lucky
could have buried him

And then he'd've tracked me down and he'd've killed me
No, he wouldn't

fuckin' Marine
(Holding his oxygen mask) He's okay
He always was
Remo, what do you think
(Pause) Look
why take a chance
At least, that's the way  feel about it
,     - and his  are walking toward their car
You call Artie
and you tell him don't care what, he's gotta be in my office Thursday morning before eleven o'clock
It's done
His  veers to the left, walking away from  who keeps talking
(
) It's done
(To himself) It's terribly important
gotta have a conversation with this guy
That's all
's men,  and , appear from behind  and shoot him dead
They empty their silent half-load rounds into  even after he's down on the snowy ground
They walk away discreetly, leaving him partially hidden between cars
(
) As much as they liked him,  mean, he wasn't one of us
He wasn't Italian
As far as they knew, he could have talked
Otherwise, Stony might still be alive
: '    - : The camera moves down a waterfall to reveal 's Spanish- style house
(
) The first one to skip was John Nance
He found a nice, warm secluded place in Costa Rica
He thought nobody would find him there
Several gunshots are heard
emerges from the house through a door and runs along a verandah to another door
He breaks a pane of glass, unlocks another door and runs in
emerges from the first door and follows him back into the house
Several more shots are heard
emerges from yet another door, only this time he's been shot in the stomach
He painfully staggers away from the hitmen
(
) But, then, his kid got nabbed by the Feds for drugs, and so naturally the bosses were afraid he'd come out of hidin' just to save his kid and give 'em all up
So
and  come out of the house and approach from behind
Hey, where you goin', jag-off
kneels down
points his gun expertly at the top of 's head and fires
Blood splatters from 's mouth and he falls to the ground
The gunmen walk away
(
) But anyway, they, you know, they all had to follow
- bound    and a  are kneeling next to a large pit in the esert ground in front of  and
(
) Everybody went down
The  groans as he's shot in the head by
Blood splatters and he falls right into the pre-dug hole
Go ahead, fuck
Fuck you
shoots the  in the head, he too falls backward into the pit
The gunmen fire more rounds into the bodies, then toss their guns into the hole
(
) Before you knew it
- , a sharply dressed Tangiers , is getting into his new Lincoln
(
) anybody who knew anything wound up gettin' whacked
sneaks up from behind and hits the  with a lead pipe
He puts a plastic bag over his head and begins to choke him to death
The  struggles a bit but the bag soon fills with blood
strikes him with the pipe one last time
- The camera pans away from an empty registration desk to a motel corridor
(
) (Gasping) Oh
Oh, no
No
The camera moves past several rooms along a cinder block wall
(
) After Ginger took off, she wasn't much help to anybody
She found some pimps, low-lifes, druggies and bikers in
And in a few months, they went through all the money and all the jewels
Suddenly, a door opens and  overdosing, staggers into the hall looking for help
She gasps, goes halfway down the seedy corridor towards the desk, but collapses and dies
(
) After they found her body
had a private doctor do another autopsy
He said they gave her
a hot dose
In the end
all she had left was thirty-six hundred in mint-condition coins
'    - emerges from the restaurant, smoking a cigarette as in the first scene in the film
He gets into his car to start the ignition
(
) No matter what the Feds or the papers might have said about my car bombing
Flames surge from the windshield, concealing  behind the wheel
:
'    - The sign above him reads: 'Tony Roma's a Place for Ribs'
is leaving the restaurant and walking to his car
(
) it was amateur night, and you could tell
Whoever it was, they put the dynamite under the passenger side
But what they didn't know, what nobody outside the factory knew, was that that model car was made with a metal plate under the driver's seat
It's the only thing that saved my life
opens his car door and gets in
' ,  '    - turns on the ignition and we see two- and three-inch flames come out of the defroster vents
Everything goes silent as he is suddenly engulfed in flames
The car explodes in flames two storeys high
The screen fills with the rising explosion of smoke and fire
(
) The bombing was never authorized, but  suspect  know who lit the fuse
- ,  and  get out of a car on a farm road for a meeting
, a heavy-set wiseguy, is already there
(
) Hey, Nicky
(
) And so did the power that be
Hey, Mikey, how's your hernia
They shake hands
How you doin'
approaches  from behind
(
) It took months for
:
- 's car drives up the farm road to meet his crew
: (
) everything to calm down, but finally my guys got out on bail and the bosses wanted me to send my brother Dominick out to Vegas
Always the dollars, always the fuckin'
,  and  get out of the car to greet ,  and  are also waiting there, smiling
(
) dollars
mean, it was still way too hot for me to even go near Vegas, so  set up a meeting with the guys way out in the sticks
didn't want my brother to get fucked around
shakes hands with
walks up to say hello
(
) mean, what's right is right
They don't give a fuck about - urgghh
hits  in the back with a bat
grabs him by the throat
and  hold  by the arms
hits 's legs with the bat
Huh
Come on, you fuckin' rat
Fuck
You
and   pin  down and hold his face straight ahead, forcing him to watch his brother being beaten
(To ) rat motherfucker
You rat mother- hits  in the shoulder with the bat
Tough guy
You and your f- (he strikes 's chest) Fuckin' brother
Oh, you -
tries to look away
No more
Get him, Marino
(Hitting across the neck) You fuckin' scumbag
The wiseguys hold 's face so he has to see his brother
(Lunging the bat into 's stomach) No more
He swings the bat across his head, knocking  on the ground
(Still pinned, screaming) Frankie
(Looking at  as he strikes ) No more
You see
Watch
and  join
All three are beating with baseball bats
(Held down by his neck) Frankie
Frankie, you piece of shit
Fuck you, you motherfuck
The camera tilts down to 's bloody face as the three continue to beat him to death
Fuckin' punk, motherfucker
Piece of shit
tries to stand up but   and  keep him down
No more fuckin' dirty work
(Rolling over on his back in pain) No, no, no, no
(To  and ) Take him out
Take this motherfucker out
They drag  by his feet
swings at him with two bats as he's taken away into the cornfield
,   - , is battered and bloody
,  and stand over him, still swinging their bats
is on his side, still held down by  and
His face is a little bloody
(Whimpering, as they beat ) Dominick
Oh, Dominick
Oh, Dom
Frankie
(Pleading for his brother's life
) Frankie, leave the kid alone
He's still breathin'
He's still breathin'
Leave him alone
Frankie
swings two final blows to 's head
looks away, sobbing
All right
Strip him
and his hoods remove 's pants and shirt
(Sobbing as they undress his brother) No balls, you got no fuckin' balls
Oh, Dominick
Oh, Dom
sobs
They drag  toward a freshly dug grave and toss his limp, barely conscious body into it
(Crying quietly) Dominick
Dominick
(Sobs
) Dominick
looks up to
They share a look before swings his bat, striking 's head
-
and his men start beating , who groans and spits blood as he is struck
,   - , is stripped down to his underwear
and drag him to the grave and dump him over
Come on, come on
Bury 'em
and  look on as the other hoods begin the tedious work of tossing dirt on to the bodies, shovel by shovel, until they are covered up to their necks
We see 's face, bloodied and battered
He's still breathing and groaning
(
) The word was out
The bosses had had enough of Nicky
They had enough
How much were they gonna take
So, they made an example of him and his brother
They buried them while they were still breathing
full shovel of dirt lands upon 's face and chest with a thud
' ,  '    - is engulfed in flames
His jacket catches fire
He opens the door and rolls out onto the pavement, barely escaping a smaller explosion
He lies on the floor as a ball of fire rises behind him
Two men pull him away from the car
#1 Mister, you all right
#2 Watch out, the -
watches as his car explodes in flames
Ashes and debris fall on  and the two men
#2 Mister, you all right
(Dazed) Yeah
(
) They had other ideas for me
'    - is being wheeled to an ambulance on a stretcher
There are firemen and policemen in the background
(As  is wheeled into the rear of the ambulance) You sure are lucky, mister
's face disappears into the ambulance
:
'    - 's car explodes
Music in:
Bach - 'St Matthew Passion'
- The casino is being leveled - actuality footage
- The brand-new 5,000-room hotel with its entrance shaped like the  lion's head
(
) The town will never be the same
After the
- The hotel and casino implodes, filling the screen with fire and smoke
(
) Tangiers, the big corporations took it all over
Today it looks like
- Slow motion of tourists walking into a casino looking like the living dead
(
) Disneyland
- crowd gathers to watch a mock pirate ship sink in a tank
(
) And while the kids play cardboard pirates, Mommy and Daddy drop the house payments and Junior's college money
- The casino is destroyed floor by floor by explosions
(
) on the poker slots
- Another 5,000 room hotel built like an Arthurian castle
(
) In the old days, dealers knew your name, what you drank, what you played
Today, it's like checkin' into an airport
And if you order room service, you're lucky if you get it by Thursday
- The casino marquee topples to the ground in flames
(
) Today, it's all gone
You get a whale show up with four million in a
- The living dead walk down a few steps, marveling at the huge casino
(
) suitcase, and some twenty-five- year-old hotel school kid is gonna want his Social Security Number
- The casino collapses into smoke and dust
(
) After the Teamsters got
- 4,000 room hotel with a 60-foot volcano out front
Tourists watch it belch smoke and flames
(
) knocked out of the box, the corporations tore down practically every one of the old casinos
And where did the money come from
- giant glass pyramid 30 stories high with a huge sphinx outside
(
) to rebuild the pyramids
Junk bonds
'     - : house very much like 's house in Vegas, including the fact that it backs up on a golf course
We see  inside talking on the phone with a bookie
(Into telephone) Still not sure
'     - An older, grayer  is alone in his living-room with sets, fax machines and multiple phone lines
He is surrounded by newspapers and files
He is very much the way we saw him during his earlier handicapping days
(From a television set) They're off and running
(Into telephone) Probable, but may be questionable
All right
Well, let me know as soon as you can find out
sets his cordless phone down and jots a few notes on a racing form
television set shows a football game in the background
(
) But in the end,  wound up right back where  started
could still pick winners, and  could still make money for all kinds of people back home
And why mess up a good thing
And that's that
He takes off his glasses, and gazes ahead
