com Half in shadow, a man named , dressed in black, fastens a clean white clerical collar around his thick neck
He raises a jagged razor to his face,  it across his right cheek, drawing
He does not flinch
The sharp  of the jagged blade against skin is the first  we hear
cuts himself similarly on the left cheek, then hands the razor ceremoniously to a  standing beside him
The boy, no more than twelve years old, looks at  worshipfully, keen eyes shining with fear and excitement
He starts to wipe the razor blade on the bottom of his jacket
No
Never
The blood stays on the blade, son
He hands the boy a dark red velvet pouch
Very carefully, the boy, known as , wraps the razor up, hands it back to his father
From the shadows,  now raises a long pole with a beautiful golden crucifix mounted on the end, then holds his free hand out to his son
Amsterdam squeezes tight
nods toward the door
Amsterdam pulls it open
Outside is a dim hallway
We hear  that might be animal or human
begins: a steady, driving cadence somewhere between a march and a hymn
2 strides in long measured steps
Amsterdam has trouble keeping up with him
They are walking down a long corridor that's like a tunnel
Patches of stain the darkness
Sometimes Amsterdam glimpses a  peering out from the gloom
Once or twice he almost stumbles over a  stretched across his path
3 Another room, even smaller
The only decoration is a bizarre rendering of a Madonna and child painted on the wall
beefy man picks up a home-made , its iron tip sharpened to a lethal point
He is smiling
The grin is huge, but cockeyed
It occupies only half of his face
The grotesque, unending grin is the result of facial paralysis, and has given him a nickname:
Jack lifts the pike carefully, then takes a candle from the wall and bends down over a wooden cage full of rabbits
He slowly moves the candle back and forth across the cage top
Wax falls on the cage, splattering an unlucky rabbit
Jack thrusts the pike between the wooden bars, impaling the rabbit's body
He pulls the pike from the cage and leaves
4 Jack falls into step beside  and Amsterdam
He holds the pike with the dead rabbit high, next to 's cross
Did you bring the boy for a charm, Priest
No, Jack
For a baptism
Now a  joins them
She's dressed in man's clothes, her pants held up by suspenders
She wears a set of
builds, growing more insistent and more ominous
Now a figure looms before them
Over his street clothes, this wears a rig of home-made armor made from fracgments of steel, lengths of chain and bits of leather
He carries a battle-axe as lightly as if it were a twig
We'll send a few across the river today, Priest
He joins the procession
Another woman, as tough as the first and half again as large, and several more men, all armed with implements of destruction, fall in beside him
Their faces are marked with blood, like Vallan's, or covered with ritual markings made with paint and ink
The group grows ever larger and more forbidding
occasionally  dart around them in the tunnel and scamper out of their way like animals frightened in a burrow
5 Vast and dank, like a cavern
We start  on
the body of a dead rat being filled with some pieces of lead
Then a little  to reveal: an eager boy,  , about the same age as Amsterdam
He drops the last few pieces of lead into the mouth of the rat, then sews it closed
He hefts the animal by the tail, swinging it as he stands up
He is near a primitive forge where a half-drunk  hammers crude weapons into shape and distributes them to   and
The floor is covered with bits of lead and steel, which Shang has been using to sew into his rat
Shang  the crowd of men and women with their weapons
And now we see this room full
It is huge: the main room of the Old Brewery, crowded with families huddled together for warmth and comfort, or out of fear; men and women, together or separately, drunk or passed out
They are like zoo animals in a pit
There are sticks of furniture jammed in corners, or, more often, arranged at angles in the middle of the room to form tiny enclaves where the ancient brewery machinery forms irregular boundaries
Above Shang's head,  and his gang walk across a plank bridge that spans the room a hundred feet beneath them
Armed men and women from the Brewery are climbing a rope ladder to join them
Shang  up after them
The men and women from the Brewery fall in behind  and the others in the lead
Shang  someone near his own age toward the front: Amsterdam
He presses through the crowd like a hunting dog
What's the fight
The Dead Rabbits against the Native Americans, same as ever
But it'll all be settled today
Are you Native or Rabbit
(points to rabbit on pike) What do you think
Looks alright
'll stand by you, then
6 The group now turns down the last corridor, as dim and long as a tunnel
In the distance, there's a faint glimmer of light and the figure of a ( )
stops near the door
don't know you
(lightly) suppose there's to be a fight
catches the heavy Celtic inflection in the man's voice
Derry
Donnegal
Name's Monk Eastman
And you want to fight, Mr
Eastman
lf there's money in it
Fight for the Natives
They have a proper war chest
Well,  might at that
But  thought 'd ask you first, seeing as how 'm not quite a Native American myself
Let's see your skills, and we'll talk of payment later
Fine
But if you like what you see, pay me double
Monk turns to the door with the grace of a dancer and delivers a kick, sending it flying off its hinges
Clear white streams in, and we see Monk Eastman plain for the first time: a huge man, in stature and girth, wearing a small  that intentionally makes his head look even bigger
(as the door splinters settle) Stand with us then

() blows across a scene as strange and bleak as an alien planet
, carrying his cross high, steps through the doorway
The slowly follow  out of the building, which is three stories high and maybe a block long
dilapidated sign identifies it as the 5 Paints Brewery
It is the tallest structure in the midst of low, squalid , winding as narrow as a snakels back, and   filled with ruts, mud and filthy snow
few  wander forlornly about, rooting for garbage
hangs stiff, in the middle of the square, from a peculiar monument erected to some forgotten war hero
The Brewery occupies one side of a  surrounded by some storefronts and a couple of collapsed wooden sidewalks
If this place resembles anything at all, it's a horrible hybrid of London's Limehouse and a pioneer town in the American West whose best days have long passed--or never came at all
stands still, staring across the square past the monument
His battalion of irregulars waits for his signal
Now
very, very slowly
from around both sides of the monument comes , in size the same as 's, men and women both, armed like Visigoths with  : knives, pitchforks, building blocks and bricks, boards with sharp nails protruding from the ends
Every member of this second group is dressed in a long  which reaches to the ankles
Several  in front of the group sport dusters made of leather
Bill Poole
on whose challenge are we assembled
in a leather duster (  ) steps forward
He is young, lean and fierce
And then there are his eyes
They do not match
One is real
The other is a huge, bulging  upon which has been engraved, instead of a pupil, a full-color portrait of the
On the side of the square, arranged to get a good view of the impending combat, is a group of  , girls and boys, none older than eight
They talk and laugh excitedly among themselves, picking their own favorites among the gangs as if the warriors were players on a team
On the challenge of the Native Americans, to settle for good and all who holds sway
Bene
By the ancient laws of combat, we offer our bodies to the ghosts of those warriors who have gone before us
Valor is avid for glory, and glory is in our wounds
But this time can you bear to look on the glory when it comes, Bill
Can you see it clear with your single eye
Whoever fights untouched in battle has skill, but the warrior who returns wounded has been touched by God
It wasn't God who touched your eye
It was God gave me guidance
Will you be able to look on the death blow like a gladiator, and not look away
No honorable man turns an eye from his death
don't expect a death blow from your hand, Butcher
Let's have at it
There is another matter
Say it out and quick, before spring gets here
No Native American Warrior will dishonor himself with the blood of the halt and maimed
So
So we would like to know whether Squire Jack Mulraney of the Dead Rabbits can smile out of both sides of his face
pause of a single second
Then   takes the dead rabbit off the tip of his pike and hurls it across the square
It lands right at 's feet
In a flash,    opens his coat
Inside, on a special belt he carries a , a   and other instruments of the butcherls trade, all stained with blood and gristle
Now the  standing next to him removes the broad  from around his coat
The brass buckle is sharpened to a point, the leather studded with glass
The gallery of Street Kids tenses for action: they are thrilled
reaches up to the , pulls off the top piece, to disclose, underneath, a gleaming sword point
He folds the arms of the cross down, like the blades of a jackknife
Prepare to receive the Lord
And the air is full of screams and battle cries as the two gangs hurl across Paradise Square into
draws first blood
He impales a Native American on the sword end of his cross and turns to fight again
Amsterdam and Shang exchange a glance of frightened, worried wonder
Then a Native American rushes at them, shouting for blood
The boys act together
Amsterdam dives down in front of the man, sending him sprawling
Shang  the fallen warrior, using his lead-filled rat like a blackjack as Amsterdam kicks him savagely; the Native collapses unconscicus at their feet
Before the boys can thank one another, however, they are separaten by the   all around them
leaves his meat  imbedded in the middle of a man's skull, then  through the combat as if shielded by a charm
The gallery of Street Kids is thrilled by this display and reacts with three Natives who come at him at once
Monk Eastman grabs a Native in his arms like a groom hugging a bride
He raises his knee and brings the man crashing down across it,  his spine like a Thanksgiving wishbone
The gallery of Street Kids is awed by this display of power from a new star in the making
The Rabbit Warrior in the home-made armor grins at an intrepid Native and lowers his battle-axe
The Native rushes as the Rabbit Warrior swings and  the man from his legs
lowers her head and charges her Dead Rabbit adversary, delivering a shattering  to his stomach
holds a rusty old pistol, which he uses at pointblank range against several Rabbits
flies into a Native, using her    to his face
The  with the deadly belt uses it to  a piece out of a Rabbit's face
Amsterdam, beginning now to be overwhelmed by the hellish fight, looks around in growing  for his father
uses his lead-rat blackjack to clear an escape back toward the Brewery
The Street Kids can tell he's trying to escape, and start him
as Shang's  from behind and pulled off his feet by a - He  the boy to the ground and pins him by holding the sword-sharp point of his wooden leg against Shang's throat
(desperate) run with you
'm one of you
Born a Native American from the blood of five generations
- Yeah
Then you oughta be a red Indian
He pushes down
Shang starts to bleed
But now   is distracted by the sudden  of bells and whistles
He watches the  trembling on the ground, then moves off him, making for the sound of the bell, leaving the  quaking
The  grows louder as  -  full of battle ready tear around the curve of a narrow thoroughfare and stop in Paradise Square
The  on the carts toll loudly and work magic
The fighting stops
The , all carrying clubs and wearing leather helmets,   the wagons
There are several moments of  , broken only by the  of the wind and the  of the wounded
Then, as one, the Dead Rabbits and the Native Americans  the police together, hurtling stones and brandishing weapons
Even the Street Kids get into the act, kicking and biting and generally having a fine time
The gangs  all over the police, driving them back
Some lucky cops climb back on the wagons and try to get away
The unlucky police remain behind, dead on the ground
The  cheer, jeer and continue to throw things at the retreating When the second wagon disappears from view, the  confront each other once again
Another brief moment of
The Street Kids settle back into their spectator role
Then the  go at each other with fresh intensity
Amsterdam finally  his father and starts to  his way toward him
and    stand facing each other in the midst of battle like two titans: then they rush at each other, joining with a terrible fury
Shang, still blindly  his blackjack, makes his way closer to the relative safety of the Brewery, his face stained with tears of fear
He hits someone
The  turns, swats him down
Shang sprawls on the street, which is a  of mud and blood and dirty snow, and finds himself face to face with a departed
Someone has removed his artificial limb and driven it through his heart
Across the square, Amsterdam has reached his father in time to see a sneaking up behind him
Amsterdam grabs a long from a fallen warrior and uses it to hit the man a strong blow behind the knees
The  falls, howling
him again
And again
He is hysterical
and    keep fighting
Amsterdam sees, with a single look, that his father is in the fight of his life
He looks for a weapon to help
sees a  lying by the body of the Rabbit he has just beaten senseless
He grabs it and runs forward, looking for an opening between the Butcher and his father
As the two combatants move, Amsterdam
Bobbing, weaving, feinting, falling back
looking for his chance
as Bill deals  a blow that  him back and throws him off balance
just as Amsterdam has made his move
He  forward, sees his father , tries to turn but
too late
The boy's hatchet  his father in the leg falls to one knee, gestures frantically to the stunned Amsterdam to get away
and Bill is upon ,  his knife into his chest screams and falls on his back, Bill kneeling over him
He looks into his enemy's eyes
and 's
For all his suffering, 's eyes  Bill
he forces himself to look at Bill
it's a terrible struggle
but  will not look away
Amsterdam, hysterical,  at the Butcher
The Butcher grabs Amsterdam by the arm, making him drop his hatchet
You need a weapon
Use a knife
He puts the struggling boy's hand on the hilt of the knife that the Butcher sunk into his father's chest
It makes a deeper cut
And,     ', he  his knife deep into 's heart
Say a benediction, Priest
bellows in agony
Amsterdam screams at the very same moment, his cry mingling with his fatherls tearing through the air
(to Amsterdam) Hold this close to mind, boy, should you ever think of going up against the Native Americans
Bill the Butcher rises and all around him, as if on some mysterious signal, the fighting subsides
sees the fallen Vallon, takes a battered brass  from his belt and sounds  , quick and sharp
As the notes fade away, the fighting stops completely
(announcing) Ears and noses will be trophies of the day
The Rabbits  to collect their dead and wounded before the Natives can get to them to slice off the battle souvenirs
But there are many corpses maimed
The Street Kids
The main battle is over, and the Natives have clearly carried the day
The Rabbits file past Vallon, rorming a protective  around him
Amsterdam kneels at his side
Vallon tries to speak
Blood bubbles in his throat
Can't
can't cross the river
with steel through my heart
Amsterdam looks around
None of the Rabbits makes a move
This is clearly something he is meant to do himself
Amsterdam grabs the tortoise handle of the knife,  on it
Vallon tries not to cry out
The knife does not move
Amsterdam tries again
He can't budge the knife
Vallon
Nearly wild, Amsterdam  with all his strength
Vallon  in agony
Amsterdam is pulling so hard he raises his father's back four inches off the ground
Still the knife will not move
Vallon passes out from the pain
Now, finally, someone steps forward: Monk Eastman
He leans over but Amsterdam, berserk with grief, pushes him away, turns back to his father, and, with a last desperate pull,  the knife from his father's heart
He throws it on the ground
Monk picks it up, wipes the blade on his arm, closes the knife and hands it to Amsterdam
That's yours, rightfully
Now Monk leans over the lifeless body and reaches inside Vallon's coat, some money
And this is mine
Only what's owed
Use the rest for funeral
No
He tries to shove Monk away from his father, when the Native Warrior intervenes
It's fair
Amsterdam, wild with shock and grief, turns back to his father as Monk takes what's owed him
Amsterdam bends over to  Vallon on both cheeks, then on his left eye
The boy is just about to kiss his fatheros closed right eye when the lid springs  - Amsterdam jumps back despite himself
Vallon stares at him: a last moment of recognition
Hon
No, Pa
honor me
think of me
don't never look away
Vallon convulses and
Amsterdam shakes him to revive him
Take the body
Bring the boy
Several  take a step or two forward, but Amsterdam springs up at them, like an animal
Come an, lad
Therels nothing to be done now
Get away
Get away
Leave him be
He's his to mourn
And the  turn away, going back to the Old Brewery or vanishing down the narrow streets
Now a few  venture out into Paradise square
couple of scoot about, looting bodies
Amsterdam stays in the center of the square unmoving, undisturbed, keeping solitary vigil over his father
is superimposed across this scene: 1844 8
() The same afternoon
As the sun goes down, we have our first full look () at the low pale outlines of the city
The harbor is crowded with the high masts of sailing ships
Just north of the island tip is the steeple of the city's tallest structure, Trinity Church
The buildings of Wall Street are masses of concrete and wood, the streets surrounding them paved with cobblestones
Just above the financial district are the sloping buildings and rutted avenue of the Five Points
The Old Brewery stands tall and forbidding over Paradise Square
Above the Five Points, in the distance, we can glimpse some finer, newer buildings
One wide street--Broadway--seems to run from the very tip of the island clear up into the woods just a few miles north of the harbor
The only  are the lapping of the harbor water against the boats, the creaking of masts in the winter
9 closer view - The  fades off
We see an imposing edifice on the edge of the harbor with a wooden sign identifying: " ,
" The sun has nearly set
boy--about 10 years old--sits on the edge of the Castle Garden dock, gazing down at the frozen Hudson
He can just about make out his reflection in the dull sheen of the ice
His name is , and he watches himself with bewildered seriousness
Abruptly, he reaches down and  through the ice with his fist
In , we watch the ice fragments drift apart in the river current, each bearing away a  of Johnnyls face, like pieces of a puzzle
Where's your family, sonny
Johnny sees a  scrutinizing him
(lilting brogue) My mother's just there
He gestures toward a ship, where  are unloading cargo
In a hoist, they are lowering a thin pine  to dockside
On the trip, her insides all broke up
She wasn't dead and there was three others fighting for her bed
And your father
Where's he, then
never knew him
(taking Johnny's hand) We better see to you, then
10 The Policeman leads an awed Johnny through the  streets of the Five Points
Where all those streets come together right ahead is the true Five Points
But most speak of the Five Points and mean anywhere between the Battery and the Bowery
Although the night's cold, the streets are jammed
painted like carnival Gypsies sell themselves to any man sober enough to stand up
of laughter and combat filter out from garish  like the Little Naples, the Hell Hole, the Egyptian Hall
In the midst of all this highlife are  and the , looking for charity, scrounging garbage in the street
An  battles a for a meager scrap of faod
richly dressed , riding by in a carriage, hides her eyes by raising a     in front of her face
Streets hereabouts are lively of an evening
The city comes here to sport
But there's places to put up a boy on his own
Three , exquisitely costed, burst from the door of the Egyptian Hall
Under the harsh glare of a nearby gas lamp, their faces are no longer striking
Johnny ; there is something not right about these faces
And those
What are those
Well, those
Those are, as you might say, a sort of
We  one of the women's faces, suddenly harsh under gaslight: under thickly caked make-up is a smiling
sort of whatnot
Say, policeman
'll buy your bonny friend
The Policeman fetches the Transvestite a strong  with his nightstick
The Transvestite screams and falls
and Johnny
Hey
But Johnny's off, already lost in the mad street life
funeral chapel
Vallan's body lies in state
He is wearing his gang regalia, and all the Dead Rabbits   his coffin in solemn tribute
bends down and kisses the body
Happy Jack Mulraney holds Vallon's crucifix, which he has obviously inherited
As a disreputable looking Minister mutters , Happy Jack whispers to a silent Amsterdam
We passed the plate amongst ourselves
Come up with enough ned to carry all this, and carry you a while, too
He stuffs some money in Amsterdam's pocket
Where will my father rest
Potters Field, with everyone else
My father won't be buried with everyone else
He'll lie separate in fresh ground, facing east
What difference where he faces
He'll face east for the second coming of Christ
Fine, son
When Jesus gets to the Battery you show Him the way from there
The Minister finishes the service
, a funeral director who resembles one of his own customers, ushers in a  () pulling a lovely 10 year old  ( ) by the hand
The woman is obviously drunk, the girl frightened
Will you have music, entlegen () My daughter'11 do any song you like
Not tonight, Maggie, we got
Monk Eastman interrupts from the Background
How much
Any ned in your pocket, sir
hands  some coins
She sing sweet as she looks
Pure celestial, sir
(to girl) Go on, Jenny
Jenny's voice is sweet as promised
The song she , however, is a bawdy saloon song
Maggie cuts her off fast
No, Jen, the other
Jenny starts to sing a
To avoid looking at the corpse, she lets her eyes rove all around the chapel until she  Amsterdam
She locks straight at him until the hymn is over
And he does not take his eyes off her
12 Mr
Cornelius is about to escort Maggie and Jenny into another room crowded with mourners when a smartly-dressed man ( ) gestures to him from the shadows
Mr
Tweed would like a word, Mr
Cornelius
(Cornelius hesitates) Tweed of Tammany
At the mention of the name, Cornelius shoos Maggie and Jenny into the mourning room and shuts the door behind them
Then he gives Killoran his full attention
In your office
At your pleasure, of course
13 As the door opens, we see a man gazing out the narrow window onto the spectacle in the next building
He is in his late 20s, already a little fleshy but dressed with dash:
""
He shows a bemused, almost schalarly interest in the goings-on next door
This mortuary is located next to a bordello, where the windows are uncurtained and the energy and variety of the activities inside is astounding
Tweed finally  as Killoran opens the door
Mr
Cornelius
With a view like this 'm surprised the dead can rest in peace
Is there anything  can
(interrupting) Yes
favor
Happy to serve, Mr
Tweed
Excellent
Lend me something
(puzzled) Oh,  don't know what  could
believe in form and appearance, you see
Just like yourself, sir
And believe in law, and the power of example
Our city is a lawless wilderness, sir
'm asking you to help chasten it
matter of civic duty, then
And civic pride
want you to help me set an example
(smiles) only need to borrow one of your clients
14 Two native Americans open the door where Vallon is laid out and Bill the Butcher  into the room
There is immediate , like an electric charge, as other Natives stand in the doorway and crowd the hall stand while Bill walks over to the coffin
He places a   in Vallon's folded hands
Tomorrow your cortege will cross Paradise Square, into territory protected by the Native Americans
You will be permitted undisputed passage both ways
That is our tribute
After that, any Rabbits wishing to join the Native Americans and willing to swear blood loyalty will be welcomed
All others will be dispatched
He starts out of the silent room, but  when he sees Mank Eastman looking at him with easy interest
Bill the Butcher him down, but Monk's gaze never wavers
'll expect you first
Me
Oh,  don't know
All that talk of blood loyalty makes me quake
'll spill blood when the price is right
But blood for ceremony
prefer holy communion
You saw us fight today
You know we can pay any price
Not mine
Not now, and not any time after
We'll see
Independence is a slippery thing
But being a rival
well, that's dead dangerous
Bill brushes past Monk and leaves, followed by the
Now the  file out, with Monk among them
Come on, boyo
'll put you up tonight
'll do for myself, Jack
You can't
(Amsterdam stares at him) There's no mistaking you're his son
Happy Jack leaves Amsterdam alone in the room
Now, by himself, sure of no one seeing, Amsterdam
15 Mr
Cornelius is seated in his office, enjoying a late supper while looking out his window at the bordello activity across the alley at the door disturbs him: Amsterdam
What's the cost to bury my father proud and proper
For a plot, a headstone, hands to break the earth
How much
What are your current means
Amsterdam turns out his pockets, which contain Bill the Butcher's pirate knife as well as the cash Happy Jack pressed on him
Cornelius  it all
Of course you'll have to wait three days for a city permit
But all this may do for part
No
Amsterdam takes the knife back from Cornelius
That's owed another
16
/ grey day
Amsterdam stops in front of a window
He  with his scarf, trying to keep himself warm
His eye strays for a moment, and he sees he is outside Mr
Cornelius' Establishment
Then he  something else
his , propped up in a coffin, on public display
There is a large sign beside the body: "The Dead End of Lawlessness
Tammany Abhors Crime
Tammany Means Justice
" sizeable  is goggling at the body
Amsterdam  his way through the people to the street
He looks in the gutter, then looks up quickly
Someone is watching him: Johnny
He's carrying an armful of wood
Firewood
Amsterdam grabs the longest plank Johnny has
It's a penny the load
Later
He turns with the plank in his hand and starts to  back through the crowd
Hey
Johnny manages to  the other end of the plank
But Amsterdam's so strong he  him right along
The Crowd  as it parts for Amsterdam, who  through using the plank like a battering ram, with Johnny on the far end, born along by stubbornness and momentum
toward Mr
Cornelius' window
Amsterdam  the window and the Crowd  in a blizzard of
Amsterdam stumbles into the window and against the coffin, which falls over, spilling Vallon's , knocking the boy over
Amsterdam picks himself up as Johnny stands frozen
Help me
He starts to pull his fatherls body from the window
Come on
Help me, goddamn it
In a daze, Johnny steps forward and  Amsterdam pulls the body onto the street
Now: the  of  and  and   as a wagon full of  arrives on the scene
Behind them, the Crowd returns, yelling insults
The police  toward the window
Mr
Cornelius dithers at the front of the crowd
Amsterdam and Johnny exchange a look
Then Johnny  for it
Amsterdam stays with the body
as the cops close in,  clubs
Amsterdam's grabbed and hit a couple of times
The Crowd yells
swings his arm back to give Amsterdam a good wallop
and someone grabs his arm: Bill The Butcher
Easy, crusher
What's this all about
Ask the boy
paid Cornelius for my father to rest in honor
He told me  had to wait on a permit, but he only wanted time to
picks up the Tammany sign from the ground
Make another Arrangement, looks like
For advertising
(to cop) Better go along
'll see to all this
The boy
Take the little malefactor
The Cops  the wildly flailing Amsterdam to his feet and  him off to their wagon
Bill The Butcher approaches Cornelius
Give the boy what he paid for
17
/ Amsterdam is  into the police wagon
The door is locked behind him
He pulls himselt to his feet, looks out the tiny barred window,
Dead Rabbits join up in a rough funeral procession
help Vallon's body back into the coffin and place it onto Mr
Cornelius' fancy funeral wagon
Monk Eastman  up onto the wagon and closes the coffin lid tight
There are  everywhere
One dispenses drinks from a portable samovar
hawks ships in a bottle, repeatedly shouting the same advertisement: "Encourage the work of a landswamped sailor
" offers to draw portraits of passersby
Funeral music is furnished by  : a drummer, a fiddle player, and a horn player, with a couple of  performing along side for good measure
Mr
Cornelius takes the wagon reins and guides the horses out of the square
The gang  solemnly behind
And across the square, the police wagon carrying Amsterdam starts in the opposite direction
He keeps looking out the tiny wagon window
The funeral procession leaves the square and activity returns quickly to normal
Peddlers'  once again fill the air
The Buskers start a snappier tune
begins to fall
18 - huge, awful prison building modeled on an Egyptian mausoleum
Amsterdam--trying to hide his growing fear--waits on line with other , all of them older than he
At the head of the line, prisoners are being processed by a  and a couple of
Each prisoner is asked several cursory questions, then told to strip
Every one of the men is  in some way
nears the front of the line
The  just ahead of him undresses
His left buttock is missing, and his back is covered with whip scars
behind Amsterdam  loud enough for Amsterdam to hear
Ain't his first Tombs trip
steps up to the desk
The  hardly takes notice of him
What do they call you
And this is the first time in the film we have heard his name
Amsterdam
The  looks him over
Your full name
Vallon
The  writes this down with a scratchy pen
First name
told you
(skeptical, resigned) Address
Got none
'll put city
Now what's your age
(Amsterdam shrugs
) Maybe twelve
Got a family
No more
Well, where was they from when you had one
(beat) City
(writing) Disrobe
As Amsterdam obeys, the Jailer turns to the Cop in the leather helmet standing at his side
What's the charge, Asbury
Theft
Assault
Creating a
The Jailer finishes writing
Amsterdam stands naked
Through that door there
(lowers his voice) And don't stand too near no one else
19 The largest, noisiest, gaudiest dive we have yet seen, full to bursting with bawdy  even at this late hour
Therels a long bar, where men and women stand three deep; lots of small tables; a dance floor; and a stage on which four blowsy   are giving out with a ribald number titled "My Father's Teeth Were Plugged With Zinc
" One end of the bar is entirely taken up by a huge woaden keg with an attached hose
the unfinished contents of glasses into the open barrel top as a line of    wait their turn for the hose
Maggie, Jenny's mother, is close to the front of the line, very drunk, hanging on to a mush-faced
Two  watch
One has a pad and makes quick
Ought to be served in a trough, properly
Will you try some
Probably
What is it

Alright, gents and ladies, your bets now on Towser against the vermin, the count to beat is ten rodents in three minutes

At a signal from the Gamemaster, a  tosses -- fierce mongrel--into the ring
The crowd cheers lustily, continuing to shout out bets, as the dog goes after the rats

The Friend opens her hand to show Jenny a glimpse of what she's clutching: a penny

It's a danger
Oh come on

From some man

You took him and made him yours
You're a lunatic to come here like

Thank you
Just listen good
The Native Americans holds the Five Points
We have prevailed
What you do outside the Points is your deciding
Outside is your city

Anyone who says different, or does different, or thinks different

Bill keeps walking
There's a whole city to share and all you see is your own narrow streets

Yes, alright
Gladly
It's all blackjack jobs and panel games and killings for a fiver
Bill waits for Tweed to continue
But Tweed stoops and tries to soothe a canary in a cage
It's good work
As far as it goes
You wouldn't be talking to me otherwise
But we're talking about different things, Bill
You describe the present
see the possibilities
Look to the future
There is so much more
The Butcher starts to look interested

' Later
The Natives have cleared out; only Tweed and the Butcher remain
The cages have been restored to their proper places and the room has been straightened
Bill stands beside the door, while Tweed relaxes in a chair
There's things demanding to be done that no police force can do, not even an obedient one
There's contributions from every dive and brothel
Loyalties to be secured and debts to be collected
(Cont'd) And now you and your Natives have emerged as the foremost force in the Five Points, 'm prepared to extend you an opportunity
You can work for Tammany
We work for no one
beside Tammany
in the performance of these civic obligations
And for a satisfactory
'm prepared even to say equitable

It's not the sort of responsibility the founding fathers might have recognized
But then, the founding fathers never imagined the city New York has become
Maybe you Tammany boys should do your own lifting and carrying and muscle work
Might build you up
We'd like to
do miss it
But it's wiser for men in the public life to give an appearance of probity
Then get cops to do it
Oh Jesus, no
The appearance of law must be upheld, especially while it's being broken
Appearance means nothing
Perhaps not within the Points
But the smart man could go higher
Bill looks at Tweed for a long moment

Some are dressed as British Redcoats, still others as Indians
The  continue to devour the building, but Tweed does not budge from the plug
He is approached by the Black Jake chief, who is dressed as an Indian chief
May  point out that the building is burning to ashes
Certainly
And may  then remind you, Pocahontas, that this entire area is the province of the Americus company, and you will kindly keep your distance

The rival Fire Companies size each other up and start toward each other

Alright, boys
To work

But there is not much blaze left to combat and the Men quickly grow frustrated
Tweed realizes this immediately
Next building over, boys
Mustn't let it spread
The men charge into a neighboring building,  down doors, through windows and   with gusto, all to save a building that is in no danger at all
local poll named   detaches himself from the crowd and approaches Tweed, giving him a hearty  on the back
Another proud night for Tammany, Bill
Just tell them

And not to steal so in the open
Indeed, the Men are leaving the building with lots of

Bill grins and leaves to spread the word as an angry  approaches Tweed

Their business was to save my house
Tammany's your business

Johnny Sirocco, grown wary and wiry, peers into the fog like a lookout, while Shang Draper, at the tiller, looks anxious
The  of a large boat suddenly laoms in front of them, not five yards away
Hard starboard, Shang
Hard starboard

Which way's star
Too late

Then we'll take Bill the Butcher's cleaver and sell the body to the medical students
They'll go five dollars for it anyway

The cops can go to blazes
Who cares about them
Youlre all sand when it comes to cops, Shang
But do you have the sand to go against the Natives
It ain't the time to go against the Natives
We've got to build first
Then we go
If we go like we did in the river, all of us'll sink
Amsterdam is sitting off to the side, watching this ongoing debate with contemptuous detachment
Johnny sits next to him
Does Shang have the sand to ever go against the Natives
don't know
He acts like it
If he only acts, held be better on the stage

His tone of voice has changed
Jenny Everdeane passes before him; she's ravishing

Jenny pays him scant attention as she moves across the room toward Shang

That's the prize of the month

He puts the scart in his coat pocket with a , then throws his arm about Jenny in a proprietary way
You'll learn our way if you're going to be one of us, Amsterdam
Jenny reacts slightly to the mention of the name: she looks over and Amsterdam now
Every one of us gives a portion of all they steal to the gang
Morts more than men, being morts
Yeah
And why is that
Because morts have more resources
Men can work only on their feet, but a mort can turn out on her back
mean, why give at all
Why don't they keep for themselves
If you think there's something off about my way of running things, you got no place in this gang
got no place anyway, and you got no gang
This ain't a gang, no matter what you say
It's a mob
There's a tense hush in the grubby room
Shang takes his arm from around Jenny, wanting to be restrained

Maybe you can set him right
Jenny hands him a cane
Barely managing to hide his reluctance, he starts--slowly--toward Amsterdam, who stands his ground
The gang steps back to give them room in this tiny space

All the  are out in force, jamming the square and the side streets leading to it

Because your way's different, and  want to see where it goes

Amsterdam shrugs and keep walking
You act like you have something in mind, like you know every day what you'll be doing the next

What's Tammany
Why Tammany
you don't know
Tammany makes the city run
political organization that's like
like the Native Americans, only ranging over the whole city
37 As Johnny continues to speak, we see Tammany tactics in action: - dispensing coal to the poor, and  stealing meat off of butcher's wagons; a political  with fife and drum-and politicians--including Boss Tweed--in ceremonial Indian costume, and a group of  busting up a saloon; Tweed making a speech to enthusiastic and a Tammany Fire Company tearing through the streets, scattering everyone in their way, finally revealing they are not rushing to a fire but are   a rival fire company
They seem like the law, but they got a way of acting outside the law
Anything that happens in this city, on the straight or on the sly, Tammany's a part of, and Boss Tweedls the heart of Tammany
38
,/ Amsterdam studies Johnnyls enthusiastic face
They're the best gang there is
So if Tammany's the best, go with Tammany
What are you running with this mob for
'Cause they're more my size for now
With Tammany, you got to do something large, something that makes them take notice of you
You're better oft without their notice
You can run free, work your own schemes
But if your schemes have size, you need size to bring them off
What are you thinking
Johnny shrugs, grins: he doesn't want to give anything away
Amsterdam understands, turns toward the Brewery
Let me in if you ever get it figured
Amsterdam starts toward the Old Brewery, Johnny keeping step

toward his pocket
The Man is in Jenny's thrall
He feels nothing and continues to have no idea what is going on
But Amsterdam
Every silken, surreptitious move of her  across The Man's body is like a that Amsterdam can feel
Jenny's grace is balletic and
As she picks The Man's pocket, she is, without knowing it, also seducing Amsterdam mean, if you would like
might like, sir
But  can't say now
Her hand  above his pocket, waiting for the  of the stage to match and mask her movement
Why
and she starts to get up as soon as the stage
The entire car full of passengers  into one another
and Jenny's hand  the Man's  from his trousers as he recovers his balance
Amsterdam watches her withdraw her  in a flash and hide it beneath her wrap
Because this is my stop
May  walk with you a little, then
(firmly) That would be too bold
But 'll never see you again
come every Thursday to the Tombs to see my father
'll look for you
Jenny fetches him another fine --it's almost demure--and takes her way off the rear entrance of the stage
lt   up Broadway and Jenny walks briskly toward an alley
46
/ Jenny looks to make sure she has the alley to herself, then moves her body a little
and her arms seem to come off
She has been wearing a set of , hollow inside, which she can leave folded on her lap misleadingly while she goes about her pickpocketing
She's folding up the appliance--cotton sewn over a soft form-when a behind her makes her turn
May  walk with you a little, then
47 As Jenny and Amsterdam walk through the noisy bustle of the city's main thoroughfare
Are you a spy, then
Got no one to spy for
'm an appreciator, you might say
Appreciator of what
good touch
She  in the street, looks him straight in the eye
Don't bother with the chat
If you want me, we come to a business arrangement
lf the terms is right, then  decide how you suit me
Then do it or not
Just take a minute,  was Just
know what you was just
had years already of what you was just
You know how  got so good at thieving
So's  wouldn't have to lay down for everyone who had the ned
Now  do it when  want to for how much  want to
Otherwise  don't do it, and don't have to do it, and to hell with anyone's rules but my own
What about Shang's rules
You pay a lot over to him
The better your day, the better his
It don't seem gute right
(a little curious now) What's it to you
Give him this
He hands her the
She recognizes it instantly as the same one she gave Shang
And you can keep a little more of what you earned
How'd you come by this
got my own touch
Are you making me a present, or making an Arrangement
It's your rules, right
So you decide
She looks at him for a moment, then starts to  the scarf around her neck like a kerchief
48 gentlemen's  skims across a pitted wooden table, straight into Shang's hand
Jenny is giving him her
He opens the wallet, looks up at Jenny
No more goods are forthcoming
Amsterdam, hanging back, watches them both
Shang  the   , tied around her neck
Pretty slim cut for a hanging day
Where'd you get that
From Amsterdam
(beat) It don't suit you
49 evening
The streets are jammed with  and
Some people sleep in doorways in futile search for fresh air
Happy Jack Mulraney leads a group of apprehensive   past drunks and whores
Commissioner Brunt said to spare you nothing concerning conditions
Nothing but our safety, of course
All's snug around Paradise Square in my company, squire
See there
He gestures toward the street, down which one oi Mr
Barnett Baff's is being drawn by a team of
The cart bears massive barrels of what a colorful banner advertises as "an anti-pestilence influenza-thwarting solution
a service of Tammany Hall
" As the wagon draws abreast of a large group of languishing ,  spurt waves of solution all over the streets
Many people are
Jack and his Citizens jump back just in time
' Tammany makes the streets nanitary,  make 'am safe
(apprehensive) Even against them
small distance behind the anti-plague cart, moving in rough formation, come some of Shang's mob, heading aimlessly across the Square cruising for action Against them especially
Let me demonstrate
Jack takes out his    , which he  carefully over a nearby lamppost
Then, very casually, he leads the Citizens off
We'll be back for this at our leisure
You dare leave it here
Safe as a vault, lady
Since all knows it's mine
The Gang draws abreast of the lamppost
No one makes a move to take the watch until one of the   reaches out
but Shang knocks his hand away
Jack, at a distance,  approvingly
You know that's Jack's
So what
It should be hangin' off Jack's vest, then
Not here, like some war flag
That watch is a small price for free run of the Points
If it's free, how come we pay so much
Wo shouldn't pay for what's our due
We don't tight when we don't have to
It's not warring that counts
It's the living day to day
(smiles) Is that right
Did  hear that correct
John, did we hear that correct
Eyes now on Johnny
Jenny looks at him with great interest
(uneasy pause) We heard the same
So then
He reaches for the watch
50 Happy Jack stands at the lamppost, aghast
lowers her head and retches
Jackls watch and chain are still in place
But the watch has been
And hanging from the chain is a  , skinned and strangled
51 - Happy Jack stands with his Citizens
The room  as, one by one, the mob notices him
You
He  the Young Boy who had reached for his watch on the lamppost and starts to  him
What'd you do to my watch, you dirty little bastard
Jack breaks the Boy's hand with his nightstick
The Boy and
So does one of the Women in the group
Jack takes the Boy's other hand
Hands won't be so quick in future
That's enough sport this evening, Jack
(stepping forward) It wasn't him
All turn to look at Johnny
Jack drops the Boy's hand
have word for you from who did it
You're to meet him at Sparrow's Chinese Pagoda
52
' low and lunatic place: a combination of an opium dream out of the Arabian Nights and a panel from a Bosch triptych
- games played by Orientals;  and  of various colors suspended in cages from the ceiling as  and  in a secondfloor  point at them and On the main floor, a long line waits for a shot at the barrel of All-Sorts
Jack charges in the front door, looks around
All right, step out, you yellow
All the  subsides
Only the Fan-Tan game continues; nothing is so interesting that these Orientals will stop gambling
Now Amsterdam  right in front of him
It's a grandstand play
Hello, Happy Jack
'm the one you're looking for
Then you're marked for dead
Jack lunges ahead, swinging his
Amsterdam throws a chair across his path
Jack stumbles, goes down, dropping his night stick
Amsterdam grabs it, jumps on top of him,  him twice on the side of the head
There is a
The  of the Pagoda gather round
53
' Later
Festive again
And no sign of Amsterdam
Two  step away from the all-sorts barrel
Hanging from the spigot like the cat from the watch chain is the  of Happy Jack Mulraney
The belt has been removed from his trousers, tied like a  around his throat, then looped over the spigot
His  lie scattered on the floor around him
His   has been jammed down his throat
54
/ Amsterdam holds the   from Jack's uniform over his arm
Carefully, he  the coat over Jenny's shoulders
steps forward
gave no order for this
Amsterdam says nothing at first, just holds his hand out: he's holding the (very quietly) Never mind giving orders
What were you giving this for
'm calling you out, Amsterdam
got this at the hanging
It was Charles McGloin's
Everybody here saw you take it from Jenny
What was MCGloin doing with it
What'd you give it to him for
didn't give it to him
Why would  give it to him
gaw you give it to him
Last week, behind the Old Brewery
(to group) He's gone flat
got no reason to trade with the Native Americans
What about stepping up in the world, as it were, and leaving the rest of us behind
There's a reason
Making a separate arrangement for yourself with the one Native so stupid and luckless that he got hung
That's you to the ground, Shang
(very edgy now; to group) Who believes what he's saying
Can any of you believe what he's saying
Bene
We'll see
Any of you that believes  did proper by Happy Jack Mulraney tonight, stand beside me
Any of you that still likes Shang's way with the cops, and Shang's way with the Natives, go to him
(to Shang) Or should we settle right now, you and me, and just see which of us is left standing
Let see where they stand
Jenny rises, stands next to Amsterdam
Jimmy Spoils, Johnny, Sheeny Mike are next
Now the other members of the mob move in clusters to all with Amsterdam
What's your pleasure, Shang
One of the   has a dead rat blackjack hanging from his belt
Shang grabs it
He  the head oft the rat and spits it across at Amsterdam
Amsterdam almost smiles at him
Shang sneers, drops the body of the rat, and
This mob ever have a proper name
We was called after Shang when we was named at all
We're the Dead Rabbits from now
They were the best
They were history
They were legend, and we'll live up to them
55
/ Amsterdam sits on an empty pier, watching the ships in the river
There's a    as a  coils around his neck
It's Jenny
She's slipped the  Amsterdam gave her close to his throat, and she's  it
Amsterdam starts to resist
Then he sees how's she's looking at him
She uses the silk to bring his face closer to hers
She  him
What's this then
Payment for the silk
Then  the silk from his throat and starts to touch him
Then his hands are under her skirt
Then, under the cloudy moonlight, they start to make love
56
/ Later
Amsterdam pulls Happy Jack's uniform  over Jenny to keep her warm in the chill air
You were waiting for me out here, weren't you
Maybe  was, yeah
You was that sure of me
Sure enough to wait, anyway
Waiting don't cost nothing
It don't do to be sure
could go away just as easy
Alright
He sweeps the coat away from her body, allowing her to leave
'll say when  want to, not you
Stay then
(beat; smile) One way or another,  get what  want
(looking at him) Yeah
If it was just a shag you wanted
You're a gypsy, are you, come to tell my fortune
Go ahead then
Tell me what 'm wanting
You got blood in your eye for someone
It's just  can't look away, that's all
Who from
Bill Poole
You better get someone else in your sights
No one's ever taken him
'Cause he's mine, that's why
'll take his one eye, and then the rest of him, piece by small piece
You have a plan for this
You going to raise a militia
'll wager Bill the Butcher don't even know about you or care if he does
He'll know about me soon enough
And after the Butcher
You
Is that so
You'll be in love with me
Love you
You just had me
You can have a mort any time you want
So why look for more than that
That's taking love, not giving it
want it to be just you and me, no one else for either
Why
'Cause none of us means nothing in life except one to the other
don't know  want to mean something, to you or anybody
Can there be good in that
He stares at her
We'll see
Jenny pulls the coat tighter around her
It'll take a while if we do
If we ever do
And what about the meantime
Meantime's business
57 gathers in one of the main thoroughfares bisecting the 5 Points beefy  is making an anti-Irish speech on behalf of James
Barker, a mayoral candidate supported by Tammany's current rivals, the Know-Nothing Party
Hand-painted signs are everywhere, bearing Barker's unsavory likeness
couple of  provide a musical score for the political spiel
The potato is a thick vegetable
Heavy
Meaty
Comes out of the ground dirty and stays that way unless you scrub it and boil it to death
(cheers and laughs from crowd) We don't want to keep lem out of the country
We'll even give 'em a place at our table
But we ain't gonna vote 'em into office
Much  and jovial approval from the Crowd
On its fringes, Amsterdam and the Dead Rabbits make their way roughly across the Square
Any Irish hears that will be out for blood
The Irish is too busy building up Tammany
That's where their brains and muscle goes
Once they're inside with their cronies, they turn on their own outside
Tammany'd steal the air and rent the daylight if they could
We'd do the same
AMSTERDkM Not against our own we wouldn't
That's the difference
Tammany earns better
That's the difference
ain't seen their ned yet
Johnny stops walking, betraying slight annoyance that he has to explain the day's deal
You will at day's end, that's our arrangement
quarter a voter, whether they're repeaters or not
'm telling you, we got a square deal
It's sound, Amsterdam
Yeah
Well, it's ned anyway
Just make sure you count it when we get it
It's just a day's job, we don't have to make it a life's work
We work for Tammany today and kill them tomorrow, if that's our pleasure
So we're politicians just for today
Not for a minute
We're better than that
We're thieves
58 The Dead Rabbits go about the business of rounding up Tammany voters
They pick up  in alleys; Jenny and some of the Dead Rabbit  raust in a whore house; Rabbits shanghai  from saloons; corral as they walk along the street, either wheedling or bullying to get them to vote
It's the strong arm of democracy
59 On one side of the door, some Dead Rabbits, with a  of potential voters; on the other,  doing their best
Behind and all around, various   and - , representing both the Know-Nothing candidate Barker and Tammany's Fernando Wood
Varicus factions push and pull at one another as they wedge their  into the polls
He's got the right to vote, damn you
Not four times he don't
(shoves a Voter) There'll be no damned repeaters here
The Cop and Jimmy play tug-of-war with a besotted , while other gang members rush to   leaving the polls
60 The main floor is jammed with  and
Daniel Killoran bustles from group to group, making promises, taking notes and searching out Boss Tweed, who is holding court in a far corner, surrounded by would never speak ill of a rival
would never say that every Know-Nothing is a horse thief
It is my observation, however, that every horse thief is a Know-Nothing
Good-natured  all around
Even  seems amused
Killoran catches the Boss' eye and whispers to him
The Know-Nothings are already finished, and there's four more hours at the polls yet
Keep our men voting
Everybody works today
It's not a victory we need, Daniel
want a triumph
61 Amsterdam roughly deposits   in the barber chairs, as the work  to cut their hair, prune beards, and otherwise alter appearances
As soon as one customer is done, Sheeny Mike douses him with bay rum and pushes another  down in his place
Johnny keeps count of the turnover
() Now that's eight
and how many still to come
He looks toward the door, where more Repeaters are lined up, waiting their turn under close supervision
already voted once today
Cast for Tammany, by God, and Fernando Wood
Once
Come here and do your duty
Amsterdam  him and  him down in a chair
62
- Amsterdam and some   into the front door, frightening and scattering all the Chinese
(barking orders) Line up like soldiers
They got no notion what you're talking about
(To Johnny) You explain their democratic right
Illl see they unterstand
Amsterdam  the nearest two  by their  and them against the wall
63 Amsterdam and the Rabbits  the murky darkness where   lie in bunks stacked high against the walls
The Rabbits start  and rounding up the Opium Eaters
Jimmy Spoils  a couple over his shoulder like flour sacks
Amsterdam  two more out the door, past an admiring Daniel Killoran
(to Johnny) come to see if our counts square
You boys have made a remarkable showing
Who the hell's this
He's our Tammany man
Killoran compares his figures to the piece of paper where Johnny has been keeping his own count
remarkable
(With an edge) Our own Tammany man
We are coming along
Happy to meet any friend of Johnny Siroccols
Likewise
Pleasure to meet the best but one in the whole Five Points
Best but one
Who's better
Killoran looks up
Johnny, standing behind Amsterdam,  his head "" Killoran gets the message
(smooth) Maybe nobody
But when the count's done the numbers will tell who's come out in front
'm in no race
Just pay us what you owe
Tonight
At the victory celebration
64
' Tammany victory celebration
When we last saw this place--as Amsterdam confronted Happy Jack--the place was busy, alive
It's  now, jammed to bursting with , ,  , , , -,  -,  and , not all of them off duty
The  of the place is a cacophony of , , and  --which we can't identify at first
We on a huge ruby ring and we
(
) Read what it says there, alongside the ruby
read it out
and    as a - reads the Latin inscription
64 : - "Fortuna Juvat Ordentes
" grand victory gift from the men of Tammany
Now, tell 'em what it means, Mayor Wood
"Fortune favors the bold
" gives him a resounding slap on the back
What do you think
Would that make a fit motto for our fair City
Well,  could certainly see
(interrupting) We've got a motto
what is it
(no one knows) Well, hell, let's get one we can remember
We're going to build a new City hall, we better have something to put over the front door
And Mayor, you'll make sure the Latin's right
As Wood nods his assent,   across room
past the gilded  suspended ten feet over the floor, where the women and children look down at the action just below them with a mixture of trepidation and resignation
Occasionally a  will jump up to try and  one of the caged inhabitants
Still ,
passes a stage, where we finally  the source of all the strange we've been hearing: the music is provided by , a woman , a  and some
They perform some weird, mangled Five Points version of Chinese opera
The music and performance continues as we
across a  - , where   play with fierce animation and concentration
By comparison, the Occidental types playing beside them seem like tourists
Everyone  and  to place bets with the -
Above the Dealer is an oval opening in the ceiling, through which may watch the action below
These -  lean over an elegantly carved rail, peering at the action on the table below, placing their bets and collecting their winnings by means of a  attached to that whirrs constantly overhead
We continue to
until we are at the door of the place, where Amsterdam, Johnny and the Rabbits are having words with a
don't know you, you don't enter
(enjoying himself) Come on, what are you saying
If you don't know us now, you'll know us tomorrow and you'll be working for us next week
(more temperate) Daniel Killoran knows us
Oh he does
We work for him
The hell we do
(to Amsterdam) Tampen down, will you
Why don't you all get the hell out of here and go fix on a story
Go on
He  Johnny, who  back into Amsterdam
They're both mad now, and they step forward together toward the Bouncer
until Killoran intervenes
(to Bouncer) It's all right, Nat
They're saying the truth
They gave a good day's work for a good wage
Killoran   a paper-wrapped parcel of money, which Amsterdam takes firmly
fine first showing
But second best
Second, eh
You don't say so
It's no shame to be bested by veterans
The Native Americans always sweep the field
What
We count on them sure as mass comes an Sunday
(to Johnny, glaring) Did you know this
Is this some scheme of yours
No,  didn't have no idea
was working the same side as the Natives
The Natives
That's only right
Bill the Butcher's our ambassador throughout the Points, as you might say
It's deemed an honor to work with him
Everyone knows Bill Poole, everyone fears him, everyone
sure as hell don't fear him
And  sure as hell won't stand with him, or any who calls him one of theirs
Well, if it's matter of personal honor, the money can only be a further insult
have no wish to rile you further, so if you'll allow me
He  to take back the parcel of money, but Amsterdam  his hand away
Where is he
Where's Bill the Butcher
Listen, buck
This is a Tammany night
If you and Bill Poole have matters to settle, you can do it any other time, any other place,  don't give a good dancing goddamn
But you do it here tonight and all the Five Points will be down on you like the righteous wrath of heaven
or you could, as the Book says, put away childish things
Join the celebration
Personally, always find the least strenuous solution the most appealing
Don't you
Amsterdam stares at him as we
65
' As a    in the air, off the stage, and lands in the middle of the audience
The crowd is raucously appreciative as the Acrobat does   among them
past a table where the Dead Rabbits have settled
it is later in the evening, and everyone has been drinking
Amsterdam, sullen, intense,
Bill the Butcher, across the room
He is like a prince regent
Everyone pays him court, including several uniformed ,  -, and Bill receives the attention as his due
while Amsterdam keeps watching, contempt and hatred gleaming in his eye
He pays attention to none of the gang around, including Jenny
Johnny takes advantage of the situation
got experience
It's the education  lack
And you heard  was a good teacher
don't listen to talk,  figure for myself
And  figured you'd be good at everything you did
That's right
And tonight  got the ned
And now what
Now 'm ready for you
Unless there's an arrangement between you and Amsterdam
(glancing over at Amsterdam) Not to my thinking
(needs to be sure) Amsterdam
listen up, Amsterdam
Amsterdam glances over at them
(to Johnny) You going with me or him
It's my thinking matters here
You don't have to ask him nothing
What
(makes his decision) How's the evening passing
Fine
Why
(puts his arm around Jenny) 'Cause it's treating me fine too
She gets up and starts toward the stairs to the second floor, Johnny following her, holding her hand
As they pass Amsterdam he  toward Jenny
This is no game, you and me
Don't go on like it's a game
said already, it's not a game
It's business
Johnny pulls her away
As he watches her go through the crowd, Amsterdam's gaze falls on Bill the Butcher again
and for the first tine their
Bill's eyes rest on Amsterdam, take him all in
but '  him
He looks away as a steps up to pay court
and a   , center-floor,
Gentlemen and gentlewomen, if you please
we will now
raise the cages and start the bidding
The Crowd  and   on a series of ropes and pulleys to the  further above the floor until they are parallel with the second-floor gallery of the Pagoda
call out  even as the cages rise through the air
Depending on their age, the Women and children inside the cages respond to the auction with grim resignation, trepidation or fear
few, drugged or drunk on all-sorts, lie insensible in their impossibly cramped space
Johnny and Jenny make their way along the second floor gallery until she spots a   a room and walks inside
Johnny  the door behind them as a  of
rises from the main floor, where Bill the Butcher stands in the dead center of the room
He slowly removes his coat and hands it to a
He is wearing his battle vest underneath, and it is fully rigged with all his butcher's implements
The place
swarm silently, like busy ants, all over a huge wooden ,  its  of
Only the noise from the Chinese playing fan-tan in the far corner of the room can be heard now
The Kids finish lighting the candles and the chandelier is  toward the Pagoda ceiling, casting the whole place into a new riot of  and as The Butcher prepares himself
Now the Chinese Opera  steps forward and stands near Bill
He
The unsprung  begins
The  starts to move, sinuously
and Bill, with amazing skill, starts  his
The knife the Dancer by a hairsbreadth, landing in the floor near her foot
She doesn't flinch
She keeps dancing
And Bill keeps
the , which follow the Dancer around the room in a careful, deadly choreography
They land just inches from where she has just been, or will be: in a wall; a pillar; the apron of the small stage; the bar; the barrel of all-sorts
After each knife , kids retrieve it
When one of the   pulls the blade from the all-sorts barrel, knock each other over to drink from the stream that flows from the hole
Native Americans, meanwhile,   the awed, attentive Crowd
They Cops, Tammany Members and anyone who looks too prosperous or too sober
But when one of the Natives  a  , they  his hand and examine it as if they were telling fortunes
Center floor, Bill pulls   out,  one in each hand
as a  in the crowd pushes a guy who's groping her toward a couple of Natives
Hels wearing a large
As soon as the Natives  the ring they throw their arms around the  like a long-lost pal and escort him to Bill
who  both knives rapidly at the Dancer
They land on the floor, inches from her dancing feet
She   to great applause as the Natives bring the Groper to Bill
Evening, sir
Are you prepared to be celebrated
Are you ready to be famous
How much will it cost
Just a moment of your time
My men will assist you
They do quite a bit more than that: they  the Groper and  him to the floor
In the crowd, one  turns to his companion
Watch this careful
've never seen the like, not even in Barnum's Museum
The Groper   as the Natives   to the floor,
Bill has one weapon left
in a special pocket, inside his vest
It's his He takes it out slowly,  the moment
The Pagoda goes
Only the gambling continues
The  dies
The only  beside the noises of the Chinese at their fan-tan is the Groper, who  for help as soon as he sees the cleaver
Bill  the cleaver in his hand, feels its weight, calculates timing, figures distance
and starts  it in the air
it by the handle
then throwing it again
higher, and  with every toss
(in full control) What's it so quiet for
don't need quiet
The Chinese opera  commences with a dissonant
and Bill catches the cleaver again
But   he throws it and every time he catches it by its handle
he also   to the terrified Groper
Now
standing very close
he gives the cleaver a mighty toss
sending it  high in the air
up past the cages
past the second-floor gallery, jammed with appreciative spectators
until it seems to  in the air
then starts its descent
towards Bill's waiting,
The Groper  in fear
Bill  confidently, holding his hand out until
just as smoothly, just as confidently
he  his hand  and the cleaver  with terrific impact on the   of the Groper, cleanly  it at the wrist
The Groper  dead away as a   greets Bill's amazing feat
One of the Natives  Bill the severed hand
Bill  the ring off the finger and  it to the Chinese Dancer
There's for your beauty and your song
The Dancer puts the ring on her finger and
Bill  the hand to the floor and walks back to his table
The Crowd , murmuring compliments on his dexterity, and the Knife Kids reverently  the Butcher's implements
Now two  from the rat pit in the back room  through the crowd and over possession of the bloody hand
The Crowd  the Groper overhead and   from : the Groper's unconscicus  being passed from hand to hand
The Crowd looks like a wave bearing the body toward the door
The Groper's stump  on them as he passes overhead, sprinkling drops of blood and flesh like a moveable sacrament
Bill approaches his table, acknowledging the continuing adulation, and is about to sit down when a  rises above all others
Mr
Poole
Bill turns, searching out the voice
Bill Poole
And  Amsterdam, standing at his own table
His attitude is calm, smiling, respectful
But his eyes are demonic
My compliments on your exhibition, sir
Thank you, sir
It was like watching a dance
(Bill nods his thanks) Some great grand goddamned dance
(Bill looks at him more closely) You know me, sir
Do
Are you missing a finger
Appreciative laughter from the crowd
No
father
The laughter turns a little uneasy
Bill the Butcher sizes up the younger man
Do you have a name
Amsterdam
That's a New York name
(suddenly smiles) shall we drink to it
Indeed
(they drink) And to my other name
Vallon
Will you drink to that
Priest Vallon's son
(Amsterdam nods) Of course 'll drink to that
Your father was a worthy man
Not worthy of you
Those dogs ain't worthy of you
You ain't worth what they feed on, and what they shit's too good for you
Absolute
Breathless
Only the Chinese Gamblers at their fan-tan ignore this confrontation
What do you want, boyo
got to give you something, Butcher
Something from my father
Amsterdam   the piratels knife which Bill the Butcher used to kill his father almost 12 years before
You got the sand to draw a blade in front of me
You will make good sport
Come ahead and give it here, you son of a bitch
And Amsterdam  the knife, the bright blade   of his hand like lightning
And just as quickly the Buitcher   his table, sending glasses flying and breaking, using it as a
and the knife  into it dead center
The Butcher  the table at Amsterdam
sending  yelling and
Amsterdam  out of the way of the table, then   Bill the Butcher
who's already coming for him
As they  and  with each other
all over the Pagoda crowd around for a good view of the action and start to   on the outcome
The odds do not favor Amsterdam
And neither does the fight
Amsterdam fights with real blood lust, but he doesn't have the Butcher's skill, or experience, or dispassion
He breaks the Butcher's
him once in the face
then a second time and then gets  by a well placed kick
The Crowd cheers
And, on the second floor, Jenny and Johnny come out of the room
Still arranging her clothes, Jenny looks over the gallery rail onto the floor below, sees the fight
and starts to  down the stairs
Johnny her go
looks at the fight again, for a second
then follows Jenny to the main floor
The Butcher is on top of Amsterdam now
He  him upside the head with the wood and brass handle of his cleaver
Then hits him again
In the Crowd now, Jenny finds Sheeny Mike
The Butcher'll kill him if we don't do something
It was Amsterdam's own doing
And it'll be our death too if we try to stop it
(finally catching up) That's the truth
The truth is you don't give a damn about him
Yeah, well, if he gave a damn about us he wouldn't have called out the Butcher in the first place
Jenny looks at him with contempt, then  into the crowd
Johnny grabs her  but she pushes him off
On the floor, Bill uses the   of the cleaver to  the barely conscious Amsterdam on one side of his face
then on the other
until Amsterdam is barely sensible
Bill grabs him by the hair
Amsterdam's body is slack
What do you say
Loin or shank
Rib or chop
The Crowd  their choices
Jenny tries to  through toward Amsterdam, but a -  and  put hands on her and  her back
Come on, let me hear you
(the Crowd yells louder) You're all talking at once,  can't hear you
(a near frenzy) don't hear the choicest cut
The best, the vital
(they quiet a little to listen) The heart
think  must have the heart
This is greeted with the biggest  of the night
The newlyelected Mayor Wood seems to feel as if he should do something to stop the slaughter, but Boss Tweed calms him with a single dismissive
Even the Boss himself is excited by the prospect of this ritual sacrifice
Come on, look at it
You fancy yourself a gladiator, act a gladiator
(raises his cleaver) Watch the death blow when it comes to you
Go to hell with open eyes
Bill the Butcher readies himself to deliver the blow
and a his wrist,  his arm
Who would dare do this to Bill the Butcher
Bill turns, incredulous, to look into
the untroubled face of Monk Eastman
It's been a full evening's fun now, Butcher
It's enough
You got nothing to do with this, Monk
Well 'm the game warden, you might say
'm telling you this buck's too young yet
Wait till he's aged for a proper kill
The hell
With his gigantic strength, Monk actually  the Butcher off Amsterdam and onto his feet
Just settle yourself Bill
and he part , part  Bill back a good twenty feet
and let the merrymaking continue
The Dead Rabbits have scampered forward, and they're picking Amsterdam up off the floor
Monk looks at Jenny and Johnny, who each have Amsterdam by an arm
It was his father took me in first, and it's thanks 'm returning now
Eastman
(ignoring Bill) This squares any debt
Get him out of here
Monk Eastman
As the Rabbits  Amsterdam toward the door, Monk finally turns his attention back to Bill
'll have you then
Come ahead, Bill
Unless you're wanting to shout me to death
And Bill comes forward,  his cleaver
Monk Eastman stands his ground, unmoving, untroubled
Everyone looks on in awe at this contest
except Boss Tweed
(to Killoran) If these two are going to combat, it aught to be a worthier occasion
And more rewarding for all
Tweed  to Bill:
The Butcher sees the signal but can't believe it
He  his head
His blood is up
He won't stop
Tweed
Bill
Tweed signals Killoran, who  himself
And, when he stands, every and   in the place--a hundred of them anyway-- behind Boss Tweed
As Bill keeps coming, and Monk stands easy, waiting
the Natives and their  now stand, facing the Tammany crew
The Tammany backers, dressed flush and fancy, face the scruffier, more savage Five Points bunch: the twin factions of the criminal underworld, so different in style and so similar in purpose,     from opposite sides of the room
Bill
The odds are shifting, the stakes are climbing
Even the Chinese
For the first time all evening the room is absolutely
Even the Dead Rabbits have turned, at the door, to see what will happen
Tweed and the Butcher  : neither blinks
Then after a moment
a very long moment
a calm, bemused Tweed  his glass
only wanted to thank you, Bill, for the customary good job today
and an equally bright future for us both
Another pause
Bill does not look placated
The whole place seems ready to explode
until Boss Tweed  to his feet, and  his glass higher
Will you drink with me, Bill, as a friend
An honored friend
Bill weighs the proposition
then looks to his men,  his head to call them off
He  a glass off a table to join Tweed's toast
The  begins again
The gambling recommences
Patrons take their seats
The Dead Rabbits help Amsterdam out the door
Monk Eastman sidles up to Bill the Butcher
If there's one thing  can't abide, it's fighting for free
He takes the Butcher's glass from his hand, raises it in salute, and hands it back to him
At the door of the Pagoda, a badly beaten Ansterdam starts  and fighting by brute instinct
He  Jenny, and she goes down
Johnny grapples with him as Jenny   up and struggles to help Amsterdam
Go easy
Go easy
It's over
He knew what he was doing, hitting you
Let's get him up
She grabs Amsterdam's arm and, with Johnny's help, tries to  him back to his feet
(Looking at Amsterdam's bloody face) Therels too damn little of him left to know anything
They start across Paradise Square, holding him up
as the rest of the Dead Rabbits join to help them
all growing smaller in the distance against the primeval nighttime landscape of the Five Points
and the Bouncer  the door
66 Another  , and Amsterdam stands on the threshold
week or so has passed since the big night at Sparrow's Pagoda, but Amsterdam's face still shows the marks of Bill's beating
Don Whiskerandos is ministering to Monk Eastman with a straight razor, giving him a close and careful shave
Monk is thoroughly relaxed, doesn't even glance over when the door opens, hardly reacts when Don Whiskerandos says
Someone's here for you
That so
What's he look like
He looks pretty damned sorry
(looks at Amsterdam) Indeed
- Can  buy you a shave
No thanks
Face is too sore, eh
understand
No
'm beholden enough to you as it is
don't like to be beholden
We're all even, son
There's nothing more between us
'd like it if there was
Are you proposing employment
collaboration
The Dead Rabbits got to get strong before we make another move
figure you're the one to make us strong
There's a lot we can learn from you
Boyo, 'm a freebooter and a mercenary, not a teacher
can't learn nothing from you and  can't earn nothing from you either
The Dead Rabbits is going to be glorious again
We're going to reign over the Points
And Bill Poole's Natives
What will they have to say
Nothing
They won't have tongues left to speak
Don't worry about what theylll have in their mouths
You think about what they got in their hands
(beat) Listen, son
take a word from a man who was honored to fight beside your father
Temper yourself like a sword, and pay attention to balance
Anger spoils an edge
Then you say no
Monk  and points to a huge   which hangs in a place of honor above the shop mirror
It has deep marks running along its front, like - You see my instrument there
First notch represents two dollars and fifty cents
That's how much  got for my first kill
There are forty-eight more notches after it, and my fee has grown with each one
can accommodate you alright, but you got to afford me
So do business with me or do it on your own
Everything  got is still to come
So  guess it's on my own, then
Fair enough
You'll find independence a fine thing, a fierce thing
Although  do hold money preferable to all
(Amsterdam turns to leave) But 'm sure we'll have news of each other
Bound to
As he shuts the door of the shop, Monk Eastman gestures to Don Whiskerandos for another hot towel
67 large wagon bearing a Tammany banner and carrying dozens of small sacks of coal moves slowly down the narrow street
Boss Tweed sits on the front seat, next to the driver, as his minions  him coal sacks
Tweed distributes them with a smile to the  who trot next to the wagon
(to the people as they grab the coal) Tammany's here to take the chill off the winter and the weight off your heart
It's Tammany can make this city a fit place, with the help and vote of all you good people
As he continues, Bill the Butcher  onto the wagon and sits down beside him
Boss Tweed hardly gives him a glance
You sent me word
We could use help here
Grab a sack
keep my hands clean
(now he looks at him) So 've observed
(tense) Better be on your mark to talk like that to me
It was you stopped me at the Pagoda
would have cut Monk inside out
What if you hadn't
Think of the embarrassment
And what if you had
Consider the waste
Next time you're in a dust-up like that, think ahead and make proper plans
It'd be a grand source of revenue, whoever prevails
It touches my heart how you always
have our best interests in mind
Our mutual interests
That's why  want you to contact Monk Eastman
(Bill's incredulous) want you to extend a proposition
want him to join
What
Oh, not Tammany, of course not
We could no more have him there than you
But he should throw in with the Native Americans, become aware of our Arrangement and
well, use his influence, shall we say, to enrich us all
You're saying  can't do everything you need
You don't think the Natives has been doing good and right
You think there's something more he can do that
(interrupting) It's none of that, Bill
None of that
His independence is like a rebuke to Tammany
And an insult to you
Then you should have let me have him at Sparrow's
should
If 'd been confident-absolutely certain--that you would have prevailed
Monk is an unpredictable power, and a figure of size
He needs to be reckoned with
He needs to be killed
No
He's an elemental force
Them you don't destroy
But you can contain them and use them for the good they give off
He hands Bill a sack of coal
Coal
Bill doesn't answer
He   off the moving wagon, and the Needy give way quickly before him, then regroup and  after Tweed and his coal
The Boss continues with his Tammany spiel-enjoying all the attention--as the Butcher watches, disdainful of Tweed but filled with angry frustration
From his face we
68 the incredulous face of Monk Eastman, as he looks at Bill the Butcher
And this is your offer
It's Boss Tweedls offer
How do you think we'd sit as allies, Bill
The only way we could tolerate being near each other would be stretched out dead
My thoughts exactly
Then why are you here
Because you were asked to be
You were ordered to be
And who would order me among the Natives
You
And would you follow my orders, even if they was being relayed from William Marcy Tweed himself
He  himself out of the barber chair
The Butcher  as Monk comes toward him
Dubious and doubtful, my friend
But your offer--pardon, the offer you bring--is the most generous that's ever been extended
favor the terms, if not the personalities
So let us decide the way any Native American would appreciate
We'll do it the democratic way
He throws open the door of the barber shop and stands there, beside Bill the Butcher, his arm thrown carelessly around him
stop in wonderment as Monk  them
Citizens of the Five Points
It seems the Native Americans have come to trouble
They have grown so weak that now they seek my help
They can pay any wage  ask
But  ask you now
Even for money, should  carouse and conspire alongside a boyo like this with gristle on his knife and spittle on his chin every time his cock gets hard
Monk is beaming, the Butcher is appalled
His body tenses like a snake ready to spring
But the people in the street just - They can't believe what they've just heard
(to Bill) There
You see
'm afraid the people have spoken
'll see you again, you bog Irish bastard
Well, if it's a fight you want now, Bill, remember to come back with a bankroll
Monk returns to the shop and the comfort of his chair
Bill  at the people in the street
One lock from him starts them moving fast
But they do not look away from him quite so fast, or at him, either, with quite the same fear
69
(  ) The vast main room has been changed into a dance floor and decorated for the evening
An altar has been hung with bunting; '  and illuminate the place
The everyone
The room, already crowded with  of all ages, grows quiet as the Dead Rabbits, done up in their party best, show up for the revelry
Ah, the Native Americans, is it now
Are they coming
We don't want a ruckus, minister
Nor do
intended no disrespect
'd heard the Native Americans were figures of the greatest prominence here
Indeed they are, just for the moment
Let them come
Happy to have them
Everyone's welcome in a house of God, isn't that right, Reverend
As all are welcome in heaven
Ild like to go to heaven
Ild like to go to heaven and bite off Gabriells ear
You're still welcome, even with such peculiar appetites
But if the Natives do come, Father
'm not a priest, son
there's no accounting for what may follow
'm sure God's hand will guide us in that
Just as He guided you here at the right perfect time, with a right perfect regent
The young lady with the sunset hair
Miss
Everdeane
Jenny Everdeane
Miss Everdeane
Step forward, please
Radiant and curious, Jenny joins the Reverend Raleigh in the center of the room
And the evening's regent chooses her evening's partner
There is much  about this from everyone
Someone makes a wet, farting
(unfazed) Here we make only joyful noises to the Lord
Under the instruction of the bustling Reverend and his , the Women skeptically stand away from the Men, who allow themselves to be arranged into a
The Reverend Raleigh escorts the delighted Jenny to a chair that has been placed, by itself, in the center of the room
Jenny sits down, facing away from the rest of the guests
She holds a  in her hand
Now
The men, please
One by one
The first volunteer Reverend Raleigh brings forward is a reluctant Sheeny Mike
There are   as he leads Mike slowly to the center of the room, coming up behind Jenny until she can see Mikels face reflected in the mirror
She  her head
Next Gentleman, please
More laughing
The  push out one
Rejected
Now   comes forward
And  - Jenny rejects each with the composure of a princess
Now it is Johnny's turn
He  slowly across the big room, and stands behind Jenny, trying to look confident
The moment is long, the room's tense
until--just once but very decisively-Jenny  her head
Jenny watches Johnny's face in the mirror
She stays still
Finally, he walks back to the
Now Amsterdam starts toward the center of the room
He keeps his eyes fixed on Jenny
Jenny catches Amsterdam's reflection in the mirror
He
She  her head
Yes
Him
small  strikes up a barely recognizable version of " Mighty Fortress Is Our God," arranged in waltz time
Jenny rises and holds out her arms to Amsterdam
They start to , a little clumsily, as other join them
So you accept
What
You accept to be my mort and no one else's
(teasing) No, it's just that  didn't recognize you in the mirror
You still got some of the face the Butcher gave you
(going along with the joke) It's not the Butcher, it's the dancing
It shifts my face all around
Maybe you'll look better later
The Reverend Raleigh and his Helpers  among the dancers, distributing , which the  take and hold as they move around the floor
will if we're together later
(she smiles) And what about after that
After tonight
chose you just for tonight
If that's not good enough 'll go with someone else
She takes a candle from the Reverend and holds it so the light  on Amsterdam's face
'll have tonight
But after this don't come to me no more till you're ready
No more
His eyes, in the candlelight, show both his love and his Resolution
Jenny and they
losing themselves now among the dancers, all moving and holding candles
As they dance, their movement becomes , , a study in motion like an old Gjon Mili photograph
Their bodies create a the screen like the tail of a comet
70 - In the hallway
stands pressed against a door
(whispering) Amsterdam
(louder; hissing) Amsterdam
(
) Who is it
Me
Come on in
don't want to come in
You come out
Just a damn minute
comes to the door, half-dressed and sleepy
We see Jenny asleep on the floor inside
What do you want
71
/ Just before dawn
The streets are empty, the river is quiet follows  out of the house
'm going to fight you
Oh, Jesus, Johnny, 'm tired
How about sometime else
Now
You want to tell me what this fight's over
Is it The Butcher
Jenny
(Johnny turns, determined) Alright, alright
Then tell me why like this
So when  lose no one will see
And he  him
Hard
Harder even than he thought he could stumbles, stunned, then pulls himself up
And  at Johnny, knocking him down
The two friends , ,  and    with such extravagant energy that they soon
the pier
72 onto the muddy ground underneath the pier
They  with a shuddering in the soggy earth, but they keep fighting
as a   , eyes glinting like night animals, scatter like wild beasts disturbed in their burrow
Amsterdam has the physical advantage, and more skill
But Johnny has the fury
All the feeling and the frustration rain out of him physically, making the match nearly even
The Orphan Pack watches the fight silently, showing no favoritism or emotion, just an edge of curiosity
Amsterdam  Johnny a wicked combination that makes him  to one knee in the mud
But Johnny will not go down
Amsterdam, hurt himself, just stares at Johnny in wonderment
Satisfied
Satisfied
It wasn't me that's been dancing and shagging all night
And he pulls himself to his feet and  a roundhouse at Amsterdam, who half-staggers out of the way
The moment throws Johnny off balance, and he falls in the mud again, this time on all fours
Amsterdam  down beside him
Enough
Johnny won't stop: he throws a punch that Amsterdam can see coming a block away
But he's too tired too duck; or maybe he's just fed up
He takes the punch and  on his back
That's it then
The hell
And he   on Amsterdam
It's more like he rolls over onto him than anything, but he's on top of him now, hitting him in the face with all he's got left in him
Goddamn it
Amsterdam  Johnny off and pops him a solid  to the jaw
That does it
Lights out
Johnny falls unconscious into the slime beneath the pier
The Orphan Pack keeps staring from the shadow with their ferret eyes
Still silent
Amsterdam  to his feet, stops at the river's edge to get a handful of water to revive himself
Then he looks over, sees his unconscious friend
Goddamn you anyway
He grabs Johnny's body by the shoulders and pulls him to the river's edge
He gets some water on his hand, lets it drip over Johnny's face, washing away a little of the blood
Not enough
He draws some more water, and it gently onto Johnny's face
: on the motion of his hand
It is nearly gentle
73 As Don Whiskerandos' hand, holding a razor, travels over the great plains of Monk Eastman's face
His hand is shaking
What's the trouble, Don
There's someone here
Monk bestirs himself in the chair, : Bill the Butcher, standing in the doorway
It's just a man of commerce
Monk settles back in the chair as Bill the Butcher walks into the shop
You're right enough this time, Monk
(to Don Whiskerandos) Go ahead
(the barber hesitates) Go on with your work
'll finish my business
Don Whiskerandos picks up a pair of  and  starts to Monk's hair
Come out with it then
Bill  emphatically at Don Whiskerandos, who is clearly terrified
Bill nods again, almost vehemently
Don Whiskerandos  his head
Bill at him
The Barber takes a
Monk opens his eyes, starts to size up the situation
You damn craven, do it
Bill  forward, grabs the trembling barber's arm and pushes it toward (rising from his chair) What the hell
and the scissors, held by Don Whiskerandos and pushed by Bill the Butcher, meet Monk full in the face as he bolts from the chair
The long scissor   into Monkls right eye
, staggers toward Don Whiskerandos, who shrinks against the wall
The scissor protrudes from Monk's eye as he , blinded by blood, now reaching out for the Butcher Your eyes was open for that alright
And you still got one to see this
Bill the Butcher reaches above him for Monk's war club, which hangs on the wall
He grabs tight hold of it and, with Monk nearly upon him, swings it viciously at Monk's head
The  sends the scissor  out of Monk's eye, with the eyeball still attached
It also  in the side of Monk's face
He , still  desperately for the Butcher
who now stands over him, beating him incessantly with the war club
his head in
him
Don Whiskerandos looks at Bill in a virtual paralysis of terror
The Butcher lets the  , reaches in his pocket and throws some  at the barber
If  was you 'd use that to open in a new location
Consider St
Louis
The enormity of what he's done is beginning to sink in
He turns to leave the shop
but  in the doorway
Outside,  of the Points are staring at the fallen Monk in mute wonder
They have just witnessed a moment in history
Bill the Butcher surveys them all silently, then calls out to Don Whiskerandos
The war club
The barber steels himself to  the bloody club to the Butcher, who hefts it slowly in his hands, in view of all
He takes a knife from his vest, and  the   in the club
Then, slowly
he steps down into the crowd, which  before him
He walks among them in regal splendor, the war club at his side, dripping gore
As the crowd falls back, Bill spots Amsterdam, Johnny and some of the other Dead Rabbits, watching his every mave
He
the bloody war club in front of him
straight in front of him
right at Amsterdam
promise you, Amsterdam
promise you
Then he grins, turns away and walks through the crowd: prince of all he surveys

/ Boss Tweed reigns in the banquet room of a vast, gaslit restaurant, at a long table overburdened with food
Seated along both sides of the table is an array of the city's  , with whom Tweed and his Tammany mix easily
Their attitude toward the Power Brokers is a mixture of ribald fawning and fine condescension; the Power Brokers, in turn, enjoy the food, and the  from a small , and the   who flirt and entertain them, while exuding the unmistakable impression of amateur anthropologists exploring a decaying civilization
Tweed is courting and joking with a bewhiskered  , editor of the influential Tribune

Tweed
And the pleasures of the company provided you, Mr
Greeley
without the Tribune endorsing your politics
suppose you can at that
Take with one hand, flay with the other
Virtuels on your conscience, Horace, but Tammany's in your heart
Killoran materializes at Tweed's side and whispers something quickly, discreetly in his ear
Tweed  himself, rises quickly and across the restaurant floor
past the Band and the Dancing Giris
to the swinging doors of the kitchen
As he pushes open the , his face has lost its humor
75
// madhouse of activity
in black suits, vests and serving outfits by carrying huge  of food while the   works double-time to keep up with the unceasing volume
As Boss Tweed walks in, Bill the Butcher  a piece of roasted poultry off a tray as it's carried out the door
'm not good enough for your table, so  eat where  can
(takes a big bite) It's good, what is it
Pheasant
Is that like pigeon
killed a pigeon once but it didn't taste nothing like this
You killed a bull this morning
told you to make an Arrangement with him, and you come back with his blood on your hands
(chewing his food) He insulted me
He aggravated me
couldn't stand for that, for no one
You stand for anything if  tell you
You think  should be afraid of you
You act like lightning strikes when you talk
As they talk, and the tension builds between them, the two men are constantly  by the swinging doors and the unending stream of never was afraid of you, so don't think  was or act like  was, you ain't earned it
What did you earn us, killing Monk
Where'd you earn the right to ask that question
You raised some dust in the streets a while back, but no more
You got power but you ain't got muscle and you ain't got a notion what it means to be a warrior
see it lost you a lot of God's sense, along with that eye
You don't know nothing about that
It was my doing
It says in The Book, "If thy eye offend thee, pluck it out
"  followed that law with my own knife and hand
The first  ever fought Priest Vallon, he bested me
And when he came to bring me to death,  looked away and he watched me and he let me go
The shame was worse than the killing
would have cut out both eyes if  could still have fought, but cutting just the one gave me heart
When  killed Priest Vallon, that restored me
Now  sent Monk Eastman over  got glory
got all there is, and small thanks to you, squire
(measured, conciliatory) You need two eyes to see the depth, Bill
That's how we help each other
If it wasn't for me would be happy enough to plunder the Points and put the fear into people who don't know nothing else
But Bill, 'm only saying
'm counselinm
look in the distance
You want to sit at my table, fine
But you must always remember who the host is
It's not a matter of courage welre talking
It's manners
Bill grabs another piece of food from a tray
Howls these manners
Fine, if you're hungry
'm always hungry
've always told you, Bill
There's plenty for all, and more for us together than separate
We'll dine together sometime
Bill the Butcher nods, appeased, and leaves, swaggering his way through the kitchen chaos, making everyone get out of his way
Boss Tweed watches him go, his expression changing from bemused appeasement to molten rage
76
/ Later
Everyone's gone except some , cleaning up, and Boss Tweed and Daniel Killoran, who sit at the end of the banquet table
Leftover plates of food have been massed at Tweedls place and, as he talks, he from them
Let me put this to you, Daniel
Now that the Butcher has killed the single most prominent figure in the Five Points--a man of myth and moment--who is there to take his place
(as Killoran starts to answer) Of course
Then what do we do about the Butcher
He's too useful to be killed, but he must be checked
It could be a police matter
Impossible
Any cops who might have the mettle to go against the Butcher have blood ties to the gangs
They can't be trusted
And any cops that can be trusted are too craven to be any use
If Bill's to be checked, it must come from within the Points, not without
The Dead Rabbits did a proud job for elections
That Amsterdam boy has sand
That so
The last time  saw him he was under the Butcher's knife looking like a fine filet
Who else is there
Well, the Rough and Tumble Boys over to Slaughterhouse Point
There's Country McCleesterls bunch, too, and the Plug Uglies, but there's none that have the promise of the Dead Rabbits, or the stake, neither
What would that be
The boy Amsterdam has a blood feud with the Butcher
He's sworn revenge for the death of his father, and he's got the heart to carry it forward
He'll have the skill and power soon enough
Blood will make a man intrepid
Bring them along, then
Nurture the Rabbits with neglect
Let them roam where they like
And if they roam into some portion of our own revenues
'd tolerate a little trespassing if it was for a higher good and use
They'll cross with the Natives soon enough and keep each other occupied
Bill's got to be a lot more than occupied
'll hold Bill in check
If he becomes unwieldy
well, damn it all, Daniel,  might just have to oil up my old musket
What do you think of that, eh
Boss Tweed gets up from the table
is  the gaslights, filling the room with deep shadows
It'd be gratifying, Mr
Tweed
Even edifying
But poor politics, eh
Well, we musn't have that
(as he walks away) do miss those roistering days, though
Oh, and bring some of that food for the canaries

What do we charge
Johnny worked it out to a nickel less than the Natives
Just till we're established
Then we raise it a penny more than now
Raise it
Is that what you want
You say, then
(beat; then, to Crowd) There'll be no paying at all this day
Or this week, neither
This is Dead Rabbits business from now on
The Crowd scrambles for milk and the Rabbits try to keep

' The midday sun shining through the windows makes the place look tatty and slightly desperate: this is a place that needs low light and long shadows to look good
Amsterdam and Johnny are at a long bar, talking to Mother Joyce, a beefy, wised-up woman with pornographic tattoos an both forearms
This place is so clean it's the next thing to chaste
And safe as a convent, too
From the Natives, maybe
But not from us
You're saying  got to worry about your mob too
No worries at all

At the bar, Mother Joyce notices Emma being hassled, but pays no attention: her girls can take care of themselves

You only pay us
We see you safe from everyone
Johnny has been watching the drunk bothering Emma Loss
Without saying anything to Amsterdam or Mother Joyce, Johnny  the bar, walks over to the drunk and  him away
Leave off her
She don't want you
Not even if you could pay her
Hey, just a minute
(to Emma) He can't pay
can pay
(watching this) Maybe  should offer Johnny as a bouncer for your busy nights
(laughs) bouncer
don't know if he could bounce on a feather bed
He wants to be a character like you, is that it
He's got his own ideas
Too full of Tammany, maybe, but he's a fast friend
Across the room, Johnny is talking to Emma Loss
She  and starts to him upstairs
But in my trade you go on your instincts
My instincts says to heed you, and my memory of your father says 'm right
We'll shake on it
(Amsterdam grabs her hand) And have one of my best to seal the bargain
Megs
lanky blonde, seated across the room near Jenny, bestirs herself
Come here and show my new friend why we're worth special care
Jenny watches  move toward Amsterdam
79
/ ' Big enough to contain a half-gutted mattress supported by a rickety bed, some worn sheets and a few
Johnny undresses as Emma sits on the bed and starts to take off her dress
You liked that old man
You would have gone with him
like anyone that pays, that's all
Tell me what he wanted you to do
He mostly wanted comforting
never seen hair so black
Can you take the pins out
It takes so long to do back up
He sits beside her and starts slowly, almost tenderly, to remove the pins
79 : Did your mother have the same color
don't know
(as the hair cascades over her bare shoulders) Lie back,  want to look at you
(his eyes glide along her body) What's that mark
always had it
(touching her lightly) And there
Is that a scar
(she looks at her naked belly) There was a baby
They cut it out
And that on your shoulder
That looks old
Yeah,  got that when
(interrupting, quiet) don't want to know when
Don't tell me about before or what you used to be,  don't want that
What about your scars
Do you have scars
None  ever seen
Maybe you can find them
Her hands and mouth cover his body
He closes his eyes
80
/ Another room
Amsterdam and Megs are undressing each other when Jenny walks in
Go on
can see you later
Megs leaves, brushing past Jenny
What are you doing
couldn't decline what Mother Joyce offered
It's in the interests of business
You understand business
Sure  do
But there's something else  still don't understand
At Sparrow's Pagoda, did you hit me, knowing it was me
Yeah
did
She  him
In the face
Hard
Not a slap
solid
His nose starts to gush blood
He puts his arm under it to staunch the flow, keeping his eyes an her
Meantime's over
Oh fine
That's fine
'd be celebrating but 'm losing too much blood
Jenny tears part of the sleeve from her blouse and puts it against his nose
Put your head back
That don't work
Put your head back  said
(as she tends to him) So why so sudden, then
Sudden
Every day  see you and you complain  can't decide
Now  decide, you say it's sudden
It's the whore did it, then
Don't flatter yourself
It's because you're jealous
It's because you didn't lie about hitting me
Christ,  wish  had
Come here, then
He reaches to pull her down on the bed
Not here
There's too much past
81
/ The room where Johnny fetched Amsterdam out for the fight
Amsterdam and Jenny have just made love
It must be morning
don't care, 'm not getting up
This is what you meant, then
It's going to be just the same from now on
What
Every morning  wake up next to you
Or you don't wake up at all
We only just started in and you're already threatening me
It's not a threat
(no teasing now) It's a declaration of love
prefer my kind
This kind
She reaches beneath the pillow and pulls out a fine  , which she slips on his finger
Amsterdam reacts with surprise, gratitude and (of course) suspicion
What's this
Where'd you get this
You said  was the best thief in the Five Points
But  got restless
Will you wear something  got
82 - long street of tree-shaded houses
Spacious lawns
North of the Five Points
Considerably north
This is the first time we have been outside the Five Points and Paradise Square
The city rent place
Jenny and Amsterdam stand near a residence at the end of the street
Amsterdam, dressed in a suit, can't quite conceal his wonder as he stands staring at the house
What is this place
My jeweler's
She  for him to follow her and we see now that she is dressed in a maid's outfit
Come on
don't see nobody
That's the best time
They're all having lunch
83 At the back door of the grand house, as Jenny  it slowly and glances inside
You're off your head
(pleased, showing off) You can wait on me a minute
Or 'll see you back in the Points if you're scared
(Amsterdam looks at her) Don't worry
know every house on this street
They all leave their doors open
They live like they're not in New York
She   the house
Amsterdam  through the window, sees her going up stairs
Then he looks at the dining room, visible distantly through an open kitchen door
He , fascinated, fragments of the everyday rituals of a world he's never seen
As  drift listlessly from the street beyond, and a light blows,        the serving of a meal; carrying and passing plates;   reaching for dishes and passing them; the   of Konversation in accents he has never heard
It's not so much that these people and their life are foreign to him
It is as if he has stepped into another Dimension
He loses his sense of time, and of danger
So that when Jenny  his arm she surprises him thoroughly
Come on
might still be taken for a maid
But you're nobody's notion of a butler
84 As Jenny and Amsterdam walk away from the house
She holds his arm
They look young and full of hope, like a servant couple just over from the old country enjoying a day off
The Police Commissioner lives the next street over
was thinking of visiting him next month, but cops don't buy goods
They keep all their graft in cash
Amsterdam looks at the houses with wonder that he tries to make casual
She opens her satchel a little way, then  him to have a lock at the swag inside
How's that for ten minutes
It's a lot to fence
'm not going to fence it
'm going to keep it and take it where no one will recognize it
Where would that be
Somewhere west
Far west
Past the Mississippi River, somewhere into that territory
That's a hard journey for a woman alone
You'd be with me
You got it all planned and straight, is that it
Once  said 'd be with you  wanted someplace we could be together
Someplace better than here
What's the matter with that
Nothing
Except there's no place but here for me right now
got to settle things
Yeah,  know, but 'm talking about settling down, not settling debts
You don't have my obligations
85 The Dead Rabbits  across the bustling square, Johnny and Amsterdam in the lead
It's a fair day's wage
We just move the people out of the building, and collect
Who from
Who owns the building
(points) Them
The gang approaches a tumbledown  called Jacob's Ladder because of the iron rungs that run straight up its front to the roof
Two well-dressed  stare at the building fretfully
1 (to Johnny) 'm glad you came in force
There's half a hundred people still in there
2 Maybe more
1 And not one's given rent the whole year
You live here
1 No, no, of course not
mean in the city
ways north, 'll bet
2 Yes
Why
sounds from an upper window and a Rabbit falls wounded
They all
It's not just citizens in there
1 Of course it is
with arms
2 From their damned gang
Some of them live there
Some of who
2 The Native Americans
We didn't contract for that
1 We'll pay extra for the danger
No danger
But you will pay extra
(turns; to gang) Let's go and greet some Natives
Under    and a barrage of , the   the building, charging inside and starting up the ladder as if they were attacking a medieval fortress
reach out from windows to try and pull them off
The Rabbits respond with knives and
As they charge inside, the   to an  shot and we

The same
litter the street everywhere
Some dead and wounded Rabbits lie near  who have gone to their reward
Some   wander the street in a daze
is collecting money from the Two Gents, who look very pleased as Amsterdam approaches with Jenny
He's carrying a rifle he took from the building
(to Gents) Alright, then
2 Very much alright
Quite a spectacle
Oh really
Just the entertainment you favor, is it
Pardon me for a moment, gents
(he turns to Jenny) You wanted to settle, you and me
That's so, isn't it
You did agree, did you not
did, yes
Good, because  didn't want to act hasty
can never tell for sure what you're thinking, and sometimes 'm not always sure what you're saying
2 (interrupting) Excuse me, we have to finish and
(to Gent 2) Excuse me
We'll conclude in a moment
(back to Jenny) Where do you settle
Amsterdam, what are you saying
'm asking, where does anyone settle
don't know, you mean a place, a home
home yes
1 Excuse me, but we really must conclude
(ignoring him) Well, 'm saying to you then, Jenny Everdeane, welcome home
No one sees it coming
Amsterdam  around, swinging the  of his rifle into Gent l's midsection, doubling him over and sending him breathless to the ground
Amsterdam  again and swings the butt into Gent 2's face, knocking him cold
Fine place
Room enough for all
(to Johnny) Get them out of here
2 They'll come back looking for you
With whose help
The Natives
They won't help these flourishing bastards even for ned
(to Jenny) Tell any who wants they can stay
If they can't pay rent they can join the gang
But make sure the best rooms go to us
Look around
(interrupting) know this building
87
/' As Jenny leads Amsterdam through a narrow tunnel
The place is like a weird catacomb: it is narrow and dank, filled with bones of dead animals, of the two- and four-legged variety
These lead all under the Square, into the Brewery and out again from there
They're closed off and forgotten since the Reverend opened the mission
Pass me the candle
Amsterdam hands Jenny a stump of candle, which she holds high enough to see
that the tunnel has opened onto a small room just above the foundation of Jacob's Ladder
It's a graveyard, memorializing gang members gone to a better world--or worse
Trophies from many gangs--including the bones and skulls of some Dead Rabbits-litter the place in loose ritual fashion, as if this were a catacomb in Palermo
Stooping low, Jenny walks to a narrow corner of the room, where several have been laid in the rough pattern of a cross
slab of slate serves as a headstone, and on it, in fading paint, barely legible, is the name "Maggie Everdeane
" We lived in this building till she lost her seamstress work and we went to the Brewery
One day she slept so drunk she never woke and  brought her back here
Dug this myself
(beat) Families
Give here what  gave you
Amsterdam hands her a chest that looks like a small version of Blackbeard's treasure box
She opens it and holds the candle close: inside is the swag from all her cat burglaries
There's a lot of it, with promise in the  flame
Jenny starts to dig in her mother's grave
She'll keep an eye on this for us
How about some help
He  beside her and they dig at the grave with stones and bones
You trusting me with your treasure, then
Just take another look at it to remind you
can always do fine on my own
Amsterdam reaches inside the chest, pulls out a ring and  it onto Jenny's dirt-covered finger
She  him
What's mine is yours, is that it
could use this, too
From the bag he holds up a small
You making an offering to the Reverend Raleigh
Amsterdam slips the cross into his pocket without answering and starts to dig again
Are you sure we can trust your mother
88
/ listens to an angry    as they walk briskly down a long marble corridor lined with formal portraits of former Tammany worthies
The building and how many
dozen at least of my Natives
The Dead Rabbits are a wooly bunch alright
want at them
All of them, and Amsterdam especial
Now
Not just now
It's between too late and too soon
They've become a little too prominent for comfort, but they're still too small for you to soil your hands
The man who killed Monk Eastman pushing around a mob of upstarts
It's practically undignified
To hell with any of that
Tweed stops under a grand new  of himself
Very well, and to hell as well with any plans you and  may have for growth and change and even greater reward
You'll never advance anywhere beyond the limited perimeter of your imagination
don't got to advance anywhere further
Got to, no
But ought to
He hands him a fancy embossed envelope
What's this
(eyes merry) An invitation
To dinner
89
' /' Better by a little than their place in the old hideout
There's even a window that throws some  an the few bits of castoff furniture in the room
an the bed where Jenny sleeps with her face turned to the dawn light
and an Amsterdam, who is dressing quietly in the corner
He checks in his coat Pocket,
finds the gold cross
and leaves
Jenny does nat stir
90 on: Amsterdam's hand, as he places the gold cross in a small hole at a grave site, then covers it over with dirt
Then  : Amsterdam is kneeling at his father's grave
He never had his own cross
Thanks
Now he  and
Jenny is half-hidden behind an elm tree
Your touch is light, but as a tracker you work awful heavy
Come ahead
Now that  met your mother, you should come and meet my father
As Jenny starts to  towards the grave, we see for the first time
that we are in the country, a graveyard in an open field with an astonishing  of New York and the East River
() The cemetery is atop a hill, and the East River, busy with ferries and vessels of trade, glistens in the near distance
Just beyond it is Manhattan Island: low buildings, winding narrow streets, houses surrounded by open land off the river rustles Jenny's dress and blows her hair as she steps up to the grave site, looks at the headstone and sees
it is blank
No name, no date
Clean stane
You should finish the stone
It'll be finished when everything's finished
That's when helll rest
The hand that killed him is the hand that will bury him in peace
He holds up his open hand, covered in dirt
It was Bill killed him, not you
With my hand on the knife
And his hand on yours
And me feeling the life go out of my father
He looked at me
he looked at me and he swore me with his eyes
could feel his spirit
say could feel it rising
flowing through the knife like blood into my own heart
You talk like he lives in you
don't want him to live,  want him dead
kill Bill and 'm free of them both
You think you can be free that easy
You need your way so clear, and you''' use anything to clear it
Anyone, too
Me, everybody, we're all just a way for you to settle your damned ghosts
You're part of me now, like the gang is part of me and my father both
If can bring us to glory, then my father
like The Book says
my father can enter his house justified
As Amsterdam continues to talk we
91 The growth of the Dead Rabbits, as we continue to  Amsterdam speak passionately to Jenny
We first see the Rabbits surrounding and a fire wagon; this starts as a live action scene but soon into , then freezes like an old magazine illustration
(
) All of us is set on the same road together
The gang can have everything they ever wanted and get me what  want while they're doing it
We're not interfering with each other, we're helping each other
It's all the same, we're all one together
We  with sepia illustrations: of Dead Rabbit morts picking pockets and purses along a crowded Broadway; climbing onto a wagon distributing newspapers and tossing off the occupants, taking over the route themselves; swarming all over a merchant ship in the harbor as the captain doles out protection money to have his cargo unloaded
(
) We'll all have a share of the profit like we'll all have a portion of the fame
If we come to be notorious, that only means we're strong, and if we're strong that means we're ready
sepia illustration of a fire wagon rounding a corner, refurbished and manned by Rabbits, all wearing striking uniforms with short capes called (
: they will be seen wearing the tanlas from these uniforms during all gang activity throuqhout the rest of the film
Only Johnny, Amsterdam and Jenny do not wear them
) The sepia illustration turns to live action as the fire wagon  around Paradise Square,  everyone in its path, the Dead Rabbits laughing, their tamlas  behind them
(
) And 'll know that time, know it right off when it comes
Just like  knew you
The live action
the last image in the montage: an  of Amsterdam, a half-decade older, turned out in fancy clothes, but with all his fierceness intact
This is a magazine illustration, and there is a dated headline over his picture: "Fresh Scourge of the Five Points
" The date reads "June, 1863
11 (
) And just like that, there'll be no way of stopping till it's ended
From this illustration, we quickly
92 Amsterdam, as he is in the picture, but in live action,  to his feet and  at a couple of  doing battle in a ring
Now
Finish him now
Far up the sparkling Hudson, a  floats slowly upstream
It's a huge thing (perhaps half a city block in size) crowded with
They form a   around two mammoth  who are brawling with bare knuckles
Amsterdam and Johnny are among the spectators
Our man will take him in another five
What puts you in such a hurry
1 fetches  2 a powerful roundhouse punch that sends him to the deck
As soon as he hits the floor, a   appears carrying a sign announcing "Round 37
11  drag the stupefied Fighter 2 to his corner, while two  minister to Fighter 1, off his knuckles
sounds to announce the appearance, in the center of the ring, of the fight promoter, a florid and fulsome
Barnum
want to extend thanks and admiration not only to our two combatants today, but to their sponsors, the Dead Rabbits
(indicates one side of the ring) and the Native Americans
He  an expansive arm toward the opposite side of the ring, where Bill the Butcher sits with Daniel Killoran and a large group of Natives
Amsterdam and the Butcher eye each other with all the old animosity: it's almost ceremonial now, part of the Tradition
Their generous support allows me to bring you this splendid exhibition
With their indulgence 'd like to remind you also of the further wonders that await you at my new Museum, located on Broadway
There are  from the crowd at such untoward commercialism
Barnum's gallery of wonders from worlds natural and unnatural, from nature and from myth
(continued boos) And to encourage you also in the view that new Albany ordinances forbidding sportive violence on land shouldn't dampen your enthusiasm for wagering
Bets down, entlegen, and you gents
(indicated fighters) fists up
The Fighters come to center ring, circle each other, then start slugging
flurry of punches, and Fighter 2   again
As he hits the deck, the round automatically ends and the between-rounds ritual takes place again
Dobbs will take him this round
That'll be something
The Natives has never lost before
Because there's never been a Dead Rabbit fighting before
That'll shame them thorough
There'll be worse than shaming
We only got the Natives in range
It's time to squeeze the trigger, John
The next round begins and the Fighters set to,  each other furiously
Don't push the Natives too far, Amsterdam
Otherwise it'll be Tammany pushing back
That don't matter any more
It does matter, and it's going to matter even more
Tammany's the heart and future of this city
If the Rabbits is going to keep growing, we're going to have to throw in with Tammany some way
The action in the ring is
The Crowd cheers
Fighter 1 seems about to go down, but recovers and starts returning punishment to Fighter 2
They got that Conscription Act from Washington keeping them busy, but they won't leave us alone forever
And the Natives is strong as they ever been
In the ring, Fighter 1 drives Fighter 2 to the deck again, and this time (indicates Fighter 1) You call that strong, John
In the ring, a couple of agitated   are trying to get at the Rabbit-sponsored winner
start to  the ring but Amsterdam them back
(to Johnny) This is our time now
(trying to make official announcement) The winner
gentlemen, please
the winner in the 39th round is the Dead Rabbits champion, High Water Dobbs
please, gentlemen
The unofficial ring  continues, knocking Barnum about, as the new champ throws marauding Natives around like empty flower sacks
Amsterdam iumps into the fray,  some Natives away
They start for him but the champ stands them off while Amsterdam  to Barnum
Just a moment, please, gentlemen
There's a word for us all
Amsterdam promises
(Amsterdam whispers to him briefly) something large, something grand, something epic
The greatest these are my own words, of course the greatest righting of the gravest wrong ever done in the Five Points
The crowd quiets, their sporting blood still up, curiosity engaged
Only Johnny seems glum, concerned
This is to be a duel not for money, but for honor
fight to the death
(interrupting, emphasizing) To the death
If he can stand up to it
on which money,  hasten to add, may certainly be wagered
The names of the two champions are Amsterdam Vallon, here beside me, and
and Mr
William Poole, known to all as
(leaping up) They know me by any name, you son of a bitch
The crowd : this is a death match between Olympians
Only Johnny does not rejoice
He looks at Amsterdam's face, flush with the belief that the right moment has finally come, and he has to turn away
He walks away from the ring as Killoran tries unsuccessfully to  the Butcher down and cool him off
(yelling) 'll have him stretched on a spit
Killoran is beside him now, whispering urgently
Bill the Butcher shakes his head vehemently
(to Killoran) You got no more to say about this now
92 : Come on, Bill
Let go of your Tammany wet nurse
My challenge, your terms
(to Bill) Don't do it, you can't do it
There's the Conscription to deal with, and elections coming, too
That's your calling now, not these ancient quarrels
'll do my work
But this is a shame, a public shame
It demands my attention
(yelling to Amsterdam) Fine, then
Fine and welcome
Day after elections, we'll meet with seconds on neutral ground to work out time and terms
It will be done and done
He walks to the ring, holds his  out to Amsterdam
You know this hand
Last time it was this close, it was on your throat
remember it better from another time
He takes the Butcher's hand
The duel is on
93
/ : money being counted out: $300
And a  quickly written and given
We think at first this must be a bet being made on the duel between Amsterdam and Bill the Butcher- But we go  to reveal: an office, tables and chairs, and a line
Two lines, in fact
One, very long, filled with young man
And the second, very short, in which a  is handing the receipt to a Your release from service, according to the terms of the Conscription Act
Keep it somewhere safe
'll keep it with me
There is only one   standen behind the Prosperous Young Man, and he steps up quickly and hands $300 to the Clerk as the Prosperous Young Man heads for the door
past the second line, which snakes out into the street, filled with draftees who  at the Prosperous Young Man as he leaves
1 Hey, tell your Papa to pass me three hundred dollars too
2 Tell him if he don't we'll come get you on our way to Gettysburg
The Prosperous Young Man  away, but spots Boss Tweed and Daniel Killoran as he leaves
Oh, Mr
Tweed, 'd take the time to say proper thanks but
No thanks owed, son
Conscription's Federal Law, and so's the $300 exemption
You might remind your father, though, that you saw me here today, minding that the law's strictly and equitably enforced
The Prosperous Young Man hurries out, as the Draftees continue to holler abuse
Boss Tweed  for them, followed by Killoran
You see how much they like this damned law
Enforcing it's going to hurt us in elections
It's not my law, and not my liking, either
But Washington's always treated us with sufferance, and we must extend the same regard to them
(to Draftees) Boys, we are bound by honor and love of country to fight in this time of crisis
4 We're bound by our wallets and the emptiness in them, that's what
Boys, the union is in distress, our land is wounded deeply, our future is suddenly a frail and finite thing
We must ask ourselves how
5 Yeah, you could talk a dog off a meat wagen, Tweed
But let's see you fight
6 That'd be worth twice three hundred dollars to see
(as he backs off) Thank you, boys, thank you for your understanding
(to Killoran) Holy Mother
Tweed hustles Killoran outside, where the line of Potential draftees snakes down the block and into Paradise Square
Daniel, between the blindness of Washington and the damned brass of Bill Poole Tammany will fall like an autumn leaf
We must take what measures we can
Attend to the Butcher
After the elections, of course
Unless you think Amsterdam will do our work for us first
He could at that
Then he would become a fresh concern Not so daunting as this
(turns to the Draftees in the street) Boys, 've just had a word with your compatriots inside, and if you show half the sand and a fraction of the spirit they have manifeste for joining this great struggle
There is a chorus of  and  from the Draftees outside
Put a rope around it, Tweed, and swing in your own wind
Great weeping Jesus, Daniel, whatever happened to the halcyon days
94
/ Election Day pandemonium
The Dead Rabbits aren't working the repeaters this day, but Johnny observes the action as Native Americans--identifiable because of their long dusters--strongarm  into the polls
His attention is drawn to a   , who is being at by Natives as he is inundated by pieces of paper and teetering volumes of the voting registry
It's chaos
The poor Operator can't cope
95 It's chaos here, too
The large main room is filled with receiving election returns
There is  and throughout the room
Even Boss Tweed shows signs of worry
swear that science will be the death of industry
The telegraph moves the voter tabulation by wire faster than we can get the repeaters in and out
(losing patience) Your role is to expedite, Daniel, not to explain
(Killoran looks at him blankly) Do something
If you'll allow me
They both  to see Johnny standing coolly before them
There's a scheme we might try
You got no place among us, get the hell out of here however you come in
moment please, Daniel
One moment
(to Johnny) You're a Dead Rabbit, aren't you
Friend to Amsterdam
(Johnny nods) And therefore no particular friend to us
What brings you here
Opportunity
Science and opportunity
You got opportunities enough among your own
did have
But times change faster than people
Some people, anyhow
And like to stay with the advantage
Well, then, a Gentleman of foresight
Are you suggesting
or perhaps you're even saying
that your friend and your gang may be
well, lagging behind the great march of history
Something like that, yeah
Well fine, step up to history then and tell us what you have in mind
96
/ : telegraph wire,  with the election returns
And, below it--far below--Johnny, Killoran and a couple of  , looking up at the wire
1 ain't goin' up there
got my election suit on
This election'll be over unless we get up there
"We
" This was your notion, you go up there
2 (looking at polling place) Him
He looks likely, and he ain't workin'
He points over at Sheeny Mike Kurtz, who is observing the action at the polls
(calls to him) Sheeny Mike, you want to make
(to Boyo 1) how much
1 dollar
(to Sheeny Mike) Five dollars
Just to help us
(a bit wary) What's the pitch, Johnny
Amsterdam wouldn't like it, working with Tammany
2 Well, now, if Amsterdam wouldn't like it
(interrupting) He knows about it
Welre working a whole new scheme
But  won't tell him youlre helping, if that's the way you want it
And you can keep the full five
Just start climbing
(beat) Where's the ned
Boyo 2 hands Sheeny Mike five bucks, which he pockets as Boyo 1 gives him a large pair of
Mike wipes his palms on his pants and the pole
For Killoran and the Tammany Boyos, this is like a circus stunt
They watch Mike's ascent with pleasure
Sheeny Mike is quite pleased with himself as he nears the top of the pole
He turns to look at Johnny and the Tammany group below
couple of have stopped to watch as well
Mike gets to the top of the pole,  -- -toward the telegraph wire with the shears
strains
reaches
On the ground, Johnny looks relieved
The Boyos offer a partmocking round of applause
In the spirit of things, Sheeny Mike  to acknowledge the applause
Just briefly
But long enough so he's distracted
He sees the upturned fill suddenly with fear, and he  when he
a sharp, odd is coming at him
He doesn't even have time to scream
The wire hits him, whipping around him as    leap through his body and he  to the ground
97 pick up the lifeless body of Sheeny Mike and start to carry it off
past Amsterdam and Jenny, who stand on one side of it, watching
and Johnny, who is on the other
He was working a Tammany job, Tammany will see to him
He wasn't Tammany
Not like you
He made the right choice
You don't know what you're saying
You killed one of our own
One of your family
(slowly) didn't know he was going to die, Amsterdam
And don't tell me what's my own and what isn't
You're not my family
And  swear,  swear on the Virgin Mother's eyes
know what 'm doing, Amsterdam
It's you that's always been blind
(they look at each other) 'll say my farewells
Johnny  down beside Mike's body, brushes the hair from his brow
You still smell like drink
He nods to the Rabbits to carry the body on and, as he  a half-dozen into the square, carrying fresh copies of the Tribune and crying
New Tammany victory
Fernando Wood elected to third term
Tammany ticket prevails by narrow margin
Boss Tweed vows Armageddon for crime
(looking at Amsterdam and Jenny) Can't you hear the future
He walks away from the gang, through the rushing Newspaper Boys

' The place has been cleared out for a war council: Amsterdam with a couple of Dead Rabbits, and Bill the Butcher with a few Natives
They sit at a round poker table with a green felt top
We say the Square is the place
Let Barnum sell the tickets for a share of the price
(interrupting) small share
And the Rabbits and Natives will split the majority portion equal
Who works the crowd
Nobody
This is a day of honor
No pickpockets, no lush-rollers, nothing
'll cut their hands off
After the fight
We got to fix positions for everyone so there won't be no other fighting
know for fact the Roach Guards has sworn blood against the Black Birds, and the Forty Thieves don't tolerate the Chichesters
As these delicate negotiations continue, the only two outsiders in the place, Mother Joyce and a Bartender, are listening intently on the far side of the room
Amsterdam will make the Butcher a fine banquet

Your first payment, m'lords
The Young Crowd Member hurls a  through the front window of a nearby store

Barnum, whose Museum is burning in the distance

of pain and fear as  jump out of the way of the wild animal, then course up the street toward Broadway burning in the distance
From , on the roof of Jacob's Ladder, Amsterdam and Jenny watch the madness below
(watching lion) That must be the vanguard of Barnum's army
This city will burn like Gomorrah
Then we'll take what we can before it gets too hot
think it's past that already
It'll never come to that
These people ain't gang-led and they have no purpose
They'd rather die for themselves than the army, that's the purpose
What would you do
Fight better and not get so mad
They're only doing what they should have done years ago
Why'd they ever think there was another way to live
They believed what people told them, that's all
What people is that
The Reverend at the mission
Boss Tweed
Daniel Killoran
People like Johnny Sirocco
You believed Johnny
Hell
And  believed you
ain't done nothing different than what  told you, Jen
believed what you said abaut being with me, with me alone
But you lied to me
It's not me alone, it's just you and Bill Poole
Youlre so blood-blind you can't see nothing else, not even this
don't care a fine damn about what they want
It's what  want
They won't dare harm the Points, that's all  care about
Let them turn the rest of the city into hell
It's another country anyway
It's not a country for me, Amsterdam
don't know about you
Will you come with me
Not now
Now is when 'm going
Will you come
don't want all this fighting to go to waste, Jen
want to come out of it with something
And  got to be waiting for the Butcher

/' Jenny digs out her treasure from her mother's grave, throws open the box, starts to  all the swag she can and hide it on her person
in her pockets, under her clothes, anywhere
She takes as much as she can, but she has to travel fast

The street is  with people fleeing and people fighting
as Jenny forces her way through, trying to escape

We're with you, don't harm us
Show us your spirit and come out with us then
And put a candle in the window to show you're one with us

The Mob Woman hands the Wife a candle, then runs back to join the mob
Jenny starts to cross Paradise Square now

and passes the stand where Tweed delivered his speech that very morning
She sees: the Cavalry officer
Several   have revived him with water
He has been beaten terribly, but as he  and starts to regain consciousness, the   fall upon him with fresh fury,  and his helpless body

Chaos
Jenny is buffeted wildly
It's like being in a whirlpool
She grabs a   whose face is bruised and blaody but whose eyes shine wildly
What is it
Cops has everything closed to the north, and the militia's coming

She sees: , and  attacking a small group of

The Girl lunges at her with a knite, and Jenny

The rioters rally, over the bodies of fallen cops and soldiers
Now the advantage is theirs; cops and militia are in retreat
Jenny climbs up on shore and joins the mob as it presses back inland
106
/ Further from the docks
Shells still exploding in the distance
Jenny moves with the marauding mob, recognizes Doyers Street
She splits away from the mob, moves stealthily into the street known as the Bloody Angle
And
Weird shadows dance on the walls of the buildings

The angle is lined with lampposts
And from every lamppost dangles the of a black man
Or woman
Or child
Some are still smouldering
At the base of a lamppost, a group of  have cut open the hog-tied of a black man and are pouring oil into it

There are flames in the distance
The whole gang is assembled, facing him as he speaks
No we ain't going to fight, but we can take something for ourselves out of this
want to know who hung them bodies in the Bloody Angle
want to address who done it
Five thousand people in the street done it
Boss Tweed done it
Abe Lincoln done it
There's nothing you can do about any one of them but stay with us
You'll have a little of your own back
How's that
These riots are a gift

they've made everything clear, as you might say
(to Jenny) Are you with us, then
Until  can get out
'll go with you
(straight at Amsterdam) meantime
Good
We're going for the Armory at Canal Street
The Armory
We'll have to beat the militia to get there
There's a way through the lines
Jen, did you see the cops and militia
can show you from here where they are
doubt they'll get to the Armory in force before midday tomorrow
We'll get there first
We'll take everything we can carry, and destroy the rest so no one else has the use of it, the militia, the Natives, nobody
Then we'll turn to real business
We'll go down to the Battery
Why, we going to take a sail to Europe
No
But we could, after this
We're going
(slowly, savoring this) we're going to take the banks
The government banks
(awed silence from all) Are we not

One by one, then in small groups, the entire gang  her
They are uncertain, reluctant, even frightened at the audacity of the scheme
But they stand with Amsterdam

/ The crowded main room of Boss Tweed's domain, jammed with anxious and , as well as a harried group of who receive news of the riots from all over Manhattan
There is a huge map of the city against one wall: the place has been converted from a political princedom to an operational headquarters
Johnny Sirocco and Bill The Butcher are there
Other guests include the , Mayor Fernando Wood, and a badly shaken Horace Greeley
They attacked me
had every sympathy for them at first
Too much sympathy, Horace
Writing these riots were a rising against "unjust laws and unsuitable law-givers
" The shame
suspended the draft at noon but the mobs only grew more virulent
It is a criminal rising of the lowest class, of the Gangsters and rabble who have been allowed by Tammany to run lawless
It was Tammany and the rabble that elected you, Governor
And it's Tammany and the gangs who'll stop it
Isn't that so, Bill
(nods at Johnny) won't say nothin' in front of him
Who knows what business he's here on
He's here on our business and my invitation
He's already been of great help
What's the opposition strength, John
To answer, Johnny yanks back a  drawn across a high window
The view, looking downtown, is one of almost continual -- every place the eye falls,  burn in sympathy for the rioters
Each candle is against you, gents
"Against you," sir
Don't you mean "us"
(diplomatic) Some of us come from those people, Mayor
'll not deny they still claim part of me
Which part
Perhaps your heart
Gentlemen, 'm sorry you find it necessary to question the loyalty of my friend here, and by extension, my own judgement
So as proof
John, where will the mob go
What will the gangs do
(Johnny is uneasy about answering) Go on, tell them what you told me
There's no telling about the mob
Or the small gangs
But the Dead Rabbits if  was Amsterdam
(interrupting) As indeed you nearly was
Were
if  was
'd figure to take the Rabbits to the Armory
Would you agree with that, Bill
Wouldn't you do the same
If you were fighting against the militia instead of beside them
Beside them
What are you talking
(interrupting) You will have to fight beside them to take the Armory
It cannot fall into unfriendly hands
can't stand with the militia against the people
could never work the Points no more if  did
We're all of us swept up in a great tide of events, Bill
Have you learned to swim
From Bill's face, struggling to make sense of this, knowing Tweed's right but not wanting to believe it, we
109
/ Johnny's face, as Tweed talks to him
It is later, and the Butcher has left
The activity is still frantic all around, but Tweed speaks in unhurried tones
'm sure that Bill will do his usual splendid job
But after that
well, 'm afraid he's grown away from us
(Johnny looks puzzled) He shows distressing signs of
shall we say, free-thinking
Crime flourishes in chaos, and these riots could encourage Bill to overstep himself
He no longer inspires in me the same trust
well, that you might
If you can prove yourself further
109 : You already said in front of everyone you trusted me
In vital things
Would  be talking to you now otherwise
Vital things, but small things
Are you equal to greater responsibility and opportunity
Such as what
Ridding me of Bill the Butcher
(Johnny is startled) He may question your loyalty to me, but Bill would never believe you had the sand to go against him
He'd never expect it
Do you have the sand
From Johnny's face, struggling to make the right answer, we

' Ansterdam's face, as he looks up from preparing a brace of pistols for the next day's scheme
Let him in
Johnny enters the common room of Jaccb's Ladder, where the Dead Rabbits have gathered to ready themselves
As they work over their weapons and prepare battle dress, Johnny walks through their midst
They do not acknowledge him
except for Jenny
Did you miss us, John
Not a bit
(rising to meet him) Are you here to spy
don't have to spy
Amsterdam leads Johnny off to a shadowy corner of the room where they can talk privately
(as they walk) know what you're doing
told Tweed what you're doing
You don't know what 'm doing
You're going after the Armory
Am  now
Why do you think that
'Cause that's what  would do, and you and  think alike
No more
And it don't seem worth a visit to tell me something you already think 'm doing
There's something else alright
Tweed's arranged to kill Bill the Butcher
(disbelieving) Who could Tweed get to do that
One of his own
There's no one around him
(interrupting) Listen, it don't matter who, it's going to be done, that's all
Tweed ain't going to wait around for you and Bill to settle yourselves
'm telling you so you have a chance
Chance of what
chance
a chance to do what you want
Bury the Butcher, draw what blood you got to
But you better make speed
The Natives will move on the Armory too
And what's any of it mean to you
It means whatever's left of friendship,  don't know
There's still part of me here
don't want to see you lose everything in your life at once
'm going to lose nothing
(beat) If you believe me, you can stay
got to go
He turns so Amsterdam can't see his face and - So Tammany's going to kill the Butcher
That puts you and Tweed on the same side
Does that make the path clear enough to suit you
From Amsterdam's face, trying to work out all the new angles, we
111 Amsterdam's face, full of resolve, staring unblinking as
the barrels of two dozen   the edges the screen, boxing Amsterdam in, as if his head were in a frame
And Bill the Butcher gazes at him with astonishment
We are, for the first time, in the Natives' lair, a house hung with American flags of all shapes and vintages, some of them torn by battle, others by years of weather and use
Some of them go back to the early days of the republic
There is not an inch of wood or wall space to be seen for all the stars and stripes
Murder Me
No one's going to murder me
Then you better learn to fight locking over your shoulder, Bill, because that's the only way you'll ever see it coming
don't believe it, and  don't believe it's you telling me
You got no reason to care about any danger to me
One reason
You're my kill, Butcher
No one else is going to have you, not Tweed, not Tammany, not those pigs in the street
No one--not even you, Bill--will ever take the pleasure of your death away from me
'd do anything to keep you for my own, even if  have to protect you
You protect me
Get out of here and go to hell
Fine, so long as  pass you on my way
Maybe 'd believe you more if  knew who was talking to you
Someone  credit
That means nothing to me
None of this means nothing to me because  am Tammany
Without me and my Natives they're nothing but a bunch of old horses at a trough
You join with me and we fight against Tammany, fight them back and out of the Points
Then you and me can settle
But if you don't join with me, then there won't be no settlement because you'll be murdered in the street and the whole Points will be mine
relish the thought
just the thought
of cutting you up and opening you wide
So if just thinking about it gives me such pleasure, imagine how 'm going to enjoy doing it
Why don't  make it easy for you, then
He  his back on the Butcher and starts to walk out, through the entire gang of Natives
Same as you're making it easy for Tweed
He keeps walking
through the Natives
dozens of ancient enemies glowering at him
Amsterdam
(Amsterdam looks around) Don't be like your father
Don't make it too easy
Amsterdam struggles to keep his temper
But he turns and keeps walking through the enemy camp as we
112
' Amsterdam walking
But this time, he is  among his gang
All the Dead Rabbits are assembled, weapons ready
Jenny is beside him
Then Jimmy Spoils
Then a few others
As the group passes, others  and walk with them
until the whole gang is rallied
and bound for the passageway in the corner of the room that leads under the building
113 As Amsterdam and the gang heads through the catacomb-like basement, past the graves, into a tunnel
Torchlight  all around
Their steps echo like repeated rifle shots
114 The whole gang  down a tunnel under the Old Brewery
Except for Amsterdam and Jenny, they all wear their tamlas
Many have marks and gang insignia on their faces
All of them have weapons
lot of weapons
Frightened --people seeking shelter and safety from the riots--appear in the darkness, then vanish like ghosts
As the Rabbits walk, they summon memories of the first fight, that same march through the tunnels when Amsterdam marched beside his father
Amsterdam's face gives little away
But perhaps he is remembering that day too
115 The last tunnel
Shreds of light from a door in the distance
Amsterdam walks up to the door and--just as Monk Eastman did years before-- it down
Dim dawn   the tunnel as the Dead Rabbits step out
116 The first thing we see is an , who trumpets fearfully at the sudden sound of the sattere door
The gang stops, wary of this huge refugee from Barnum's Museum, but the animal is more frightened of them
It hurries on down the street
revealing behind it a group of several dozen  who carry a huge American flag and a long wooden plank bearing the legend "No Draft
" They stare at the Rabbits with something near reverence
Where's the Native Americans
Ain't seen them
Ain't here
And the militia
There's a detachment coming on from two streets over
The rest is still north of here
What are you after
Amsterdam  to a formidable building a block away: the Armory
It looks like a fortress
The Devil himself couldn't take that place
That's why he sent us

/ The  of militia proceeds warily towards the Armory
They are a young, uncertain-looking outfit; their  looks like an upstate farm kid
He tenses and his eyes widen as he sees Jenny walking toward him, carrying a  in her arms
(crying) Help me
Oh please help me
He's shot, we need a doctor, please help
Miss, we ain't a medical outfit
The main unit's ten minutes behind us, they'll have
He doesn't get the chance to finish
Jenny  the Boy from her arms and shoots the Detachment Commander once, cleanly
as the Boy roles into a prone position and  two shots into the stunned Detachment
while the Dead Rabbits  from every doorway along the street, and brandishing weapons
It's over in seconds
The Detachment has hardly gotten off a shot
Every one of them lies dead or wounded in the street
as the Rabbits  over their bodies
118 rifle emplacement manned by a dozen - They stand anxious post in front of the Armory
Each window is barred and fortified, and the front door is massive
But the tension in the Guards' faces eases a little when they see
the Detachment of militia heading towards them down the street
Some of the Detachment are wearing bloody uniform jackets; several are being carried
The Detachment, unrecognized by the Guards, is made up entirely of Dead Rabbits
Help us, we got wounded
1 We can't leave the post
Open the damn doors then
We're bad hurt
1 Where's the others
Just behind us
But  got our major here wounded so bad half his guts is out
Guard 1  for the doors to be opened to the Armory as the Detachment draws close to the emplacement
1 God, it's good to see you
Likewise
Ainsterdam  him where he stands as the Rabbits  the emplacement
(shouting) Move fast
We got to get out with everything we can before the militia gets here
As the Armory Guards return fire, the Boy Jenny carried in the previous scene  for the telegraph pole and starts to
makes the wood fly inches from his face
as the Rabbits storm into the Armory,  wildly
The Boy reaches the top of the telegraph pole and  the wire
He shinnies back down the pole as the wire  ineffectually in the air and we
/  119 a telegram, held in Killoran's hand
He passes it to Tweed
It's from the Armory Guards
That's the last before the wire went dead
(reading, furious) If the Rabbits are already at the Armory, where the hell is Bill and the militia
He  the telegram onto the floor, where it joins a whole  of yellow telegraph forms
They are shin-high; there must be thousands of them
They got to be near
So long as they're near, it's alright
The Rabbits can take the Armory, but they can't hold it
If Bill can get into position, he can make sure they don't get out
Alright then, John, you pray to any God you choose that's the fact of it
If Bill thinks he can best the Natives, that is your opportunity
That is your moment
(Johnny hesitates) Are you a Bible man
The Book says in Revelations, " saw a new heaven and a new earth
" If the hand of God's not on you to fulfill that prophecy, then the hand of Tweed will be
Go on and God bless
Johnny looks like he is about to say something, but he stops; looks at Tweed a moment longer; then nods acknowledgment and leaves
don't believe he can do it, Tweed
Oh,  think he can
Whether it's one man against another or a mob against the city, the mathematics remain the same
You never enjoyed the enlightenment of poverty, did you, Governor
If you had, you'd know you can always hire half the poor to kill the other half

Bodies fall in the street
Bodies fall from the Armory
The building is under siege by the main unit of the  and by Bill the Butcher and the Natives
The Dead Rabbits are trapped

running over corpses of comrades and enemies toward the As  , the carnage is revealed
Bodies of Natives, in their uniform dusters, and Rabbits, in their tamlas, lie side by side in the street
120 : continues from both sides as the Butcher shouts at the Militia Commander
We move now and we can drive them out
We press them and they'll break
can't spare the men or stand the risk
We stay fast and smoke lem out
Tweed put me in charge of this
say we move, and by the crucified Christ we will move
(turns to his men) Native Americans, come with me
Any militia that wants to live upright instead of die hunkered down, come with us
Bill  through the lines, rallying the men
And Johnny starts to We'll show you gladiators' greatness
Come on
The men start to  the Butcher; even some militia fall in
Johnny through the men gathering near the Butcher
He's closer to Bill than ever
Bill starts to mount their
There is  and commotion all around him as Natives and militia fall into rough formation
It threatens to obscure Bill from Johnny's view
Shield him
He has to make his move
He  a revolver as militia and Natives pass in front of him
he
he's anxious, confused
his shakes
he fires
too soon
and  a Native, who falls dead
Right near Bill
The Butcher turns in the direction of the shot,  Johnny
Their eyes lock
Johnny  again
Bill
and Bill  him
Johnny  with the first shot
Bill's above him now, looking down at him
Was it Tweed or your friend put you to this
Tweed
Bill  him again, point blank
Johnny screams
You'd lie to save your friend
(in terrible pain) No
There's no friends for me
Me the same
Pity us both
He  his revolver into Johnny
(to his men) Hold your fire
(toward the Armory) In there
Hey in there
want to talk to Amsterdam
The Militia Commander is aghast at this proposition and starts forward, gun in hand
But a Native  him
Amsterdam's face  in a front window of the Armory
Go on, then, talk
You and me
(beat) Come ahead then
And bring my friend's body
Bill the Butcher  Johnny's body over his shoulder as easily as if it were an empty sack of flour
and starts walking thraugh the lines toward the Armory
The Militia watches in disbelief, the Natives in confusion
The Dead Rabbits keep the Butcher in their sights
But no one fires
No one moves
And Bill the Butcher enters the front doors of the Armory
121 As the Butcher is admitted through the huge doors which clang  quickly behind him
It's a scene of devastation inside-dozens of dead and wounded everywhere
And enough rifles and munitions to sink Manhattan island
Bill the Butcher stands dead center in the middle of the Armory floor as Amsterdam walks toward him
The Butcher  Johnny's body in a heap at his feet
Your friend made different friends lately
Tammany's put us all in the same place
You want to get out alive
It don't matter to me
got enemies outside, enemies in here
The militia can move on me anytime
You could drop me before  get to the door
don't want to lose you so easy
You'll never get past the militia unless you come with the Dead Rabbits
You'd lay aside what's between us
'm not forgetting where  put it
If you do, 'll remind you
(he turns, leaves) What's your call, Bill
'm considering where's my better chance
He walks to the doors
The Rabbits guarding it don't make a move
He it himself and strides out into the street
122
/ Bill walks alone toward the Native/militia lines
From inside
from every window
the Dead Rabbits watch him
The sun is high, but the street is eerily quiet
There are of battle, but here there is only the sound of distant, unheard conversation between Bill, the Militia Commander and some Natives
Amsterdam  intently
The Butcher and the Militia Commander argue, but we still can't hear what they're saying
There is still no sound
until, , we see the Militia Commander's face
Huge with surprise as we  the thunderclap of a
Bill the Butcher has just gutshot the Militia Commander
As if the shot were a signal, the Natives  on the militia
It's hellish, close-quarter combat
Guns fired inches from enemies who had just been allies
Knives, swords, bludgeons, kids with dead-rat blackjacks, women with hob-nailed wooden planks, attacking better-armed but totally stunned soldiers
Bill the Butcher falls back toward the Armory, the Natives following him
Inside the Armory, Amsterdam turns to his own greatly diminished gang
Go ahead them, give them cover
Give them some damn cover
The Rabbits are so stunned to be fighting on the same side as their sworn enemies that, even with Amsterdam's order, no one makes a move
It's Amsterdam who  the first shots
And that unleashes a great from the Armory
toward the militia
The Butcher and the Natives are closer to the Armory now
and the Armory doors start to open
when a
and  on the surrounding roofs, waiting for this moment, suddenly open fire
on the Natives below and on the Rabbits on the roof of the armory
Many drop in the street and fall from the Armory roof
as the Armory doors   to admit the Natives
As they run or stagger inside, the Rabbits start to close the doors
Some Rabbits are cut down by the fire from the rooftops
Other Natives never make it to the doors
And a few are shot
when the doors close before they can get through
123
/ The Dead Rabbits keep firing, but they have sustained grave losses
The Butcher looks around at the Natives who have made it inside with him: he has perhaps one-quarter of his original strength
Well, it seems like between us we got two mobs that might make a gang
Whose gang might it be
Not William Tweed's
Jimmy Spoils and a crew of Natives  a cannon toward the rear of the Armory
Which way you pointing that
Any way you say
One direction could let us out, the other will let them in
They got to come in if we're going to fight them
Who do you want to fight, Bill
Amsterdam  toward the rear wall and Jimmy swings the cannon around
Everything surrounding them is  and  as the remaining members of both gangs  whatever weapons they can carry from the Armory stockpile
and Jenny steps forward with a torch,  the fuse of the cannon
which  and  a huge hole in the rear wall of the Armory

The gang members  for the opening, carrying whatever they can manage
Outside, the   hears the cannon blast

following them forward, then moving ahead to the Armory straight down inside (no roof or ceiling) as the Gangs through the still-smoldering hole in the wall
and drop twenty feet to an alley below
where militia on the roof try to pick them off
As the militia presses closer from the front, gang defenses start to fall back inside the Armory
Everyone wants to get through that hole
Amsterdam, Jenny, Jimmy Spoils and some of the other gang nembers are carrying
Jenny  a torch to the Butcher
Amsterdam them all toward the back of the Armory
But he stays behind
Just for a moment

He  and  for the hole in the wall, where Jenny and the others stand waiting
He , takes a last look inside the Armory
The militia is the front doors
Then he raises his  over his head
and it through the air
Jenny and the others do the same
His single torch  a path of light across the screen
The others, it, make a fiery
124
/ As Jenny, Jimmy Spoils, Bill the Butcher and Amsterdam  through the hole into the alley below
and start to run through the withering  of the militia on the roof
getting away
just barely away
As Jenny runs, her swag drops and  from under her clothes
She to pick it up but Amsterdam  her on
and just away from the titanic  of the Armory
The throws some of the militia from their perches on the roof
It sends a fountain of  and  high into the sky
It is  in its brilliance and intensity
The sky turns  with powder, with flame
In the small streets   , many gang members are  by debris or burned by  breaking off from the central flame
The Armory is gone
Much of the surrounding area is gone with it
On the ground, everything is smoke, flame, dirt, death, confusion, Corpses everywhere
Gang members and kids running all over, desperate
It looks like the last day of mankind on earth
Bill the Butcher  a couple of fallen Natives, then  through the smoke and flame and storm of ash
Amsterdam
Coming towards him
We're finished, all of us
But you and me ain't settled
We got the same now, a full share of nothing
There's nothing to settle
There's nothing left
Amsterdam takes a weapon from his pocket,  it for the Butcher to see: it is the pirate's knife which the Butcher used to kill Priest Vallon
Then let's start over
Bill the Butcher looks tired, sorrowful
He  his face wearily in his arms
And for a moment we think he has given everything up
