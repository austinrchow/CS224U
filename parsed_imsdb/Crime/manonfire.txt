"Man On Fire" - High over the city on a bright Sunday morning, the sun pounding its way through the orange haze of smog
As we descend toward the clots of traffic blocking the streets: the sounds of a Mass being sung
The big wooden doors open to release the parishioners inside
Feature a tall, lanky 18--
Holding his ' hand, anxious for Sunday to really begin
They don't notice the traffic suddenly thin, like a faucet's been cranked down
They move toward a Mercedes 500
As a  holds the back door open for them
Squeals around the corner, lurches to a stop alongside the Mercedes
get out flashing  badges
In a moment they're hustling Eighteen toward the car, stiff- arming the chauffeur
As the girlfriend  cries and the gossip among the parishioners begins
The Grand Marquis pulls away
- They shove eighteen down to the floor of the backseat
These guys are not the police
switchblade is flicked open
Practiced hands slit the boy's Sunday suit from the base of his neck to his heels
Eighteen yelps as the blade draws blood across one calf
Duct tape is wrapped around his hands, eyes, and head
- The Marquis is parked across from another wait as Eighteen is hauled out of the Marquis
His clothes drop away like a snake shedding its skin
He stands naked, bound and blind
Eighteen is handed over from one group to the other
-   -   - The phone rings
bomb going off
Eighteen's distraught  (family photos of the boy on the wall) answers

a battery of  and  in the room with him
One of them listens in, waves fingers at him as the negotiations begin
8'  4'  - wall smeared with God-knows-what
Facing   it, Eighteen stands naked blindfolded and shivering
The   back of his leg still bleeds
He shifts nervously as a   little eagerly licks the blood off  his calf
('The Dreamer'), we don't see his face, negotiates by cell phone
Voice calm
As he runs numbers, he slaps his thigh
Jack Russell trots over, gets an ear scratched
At a motion from the man, Eighteen is taken down to the ground
Straddled by two men, his head is mummified in tape leaving one ear exposed
- Rosanna Garcia Guerrero, editor of newspaper, being interviewed, "
organized crime syndicates
growth of kidnapping in Mexico over the last two years
" - As a hand removes a ziplock baggie from the mailbox glimpse of something we don't want to see
An ear partially obscured by sweating plastic and a blood smear
-   - driving around the square, Eighteen's father waving a white shirt out the window like a surrender flag
-  (3 ) Footbridge over railway sandwiched between freeway
Empty train blazes through
Dangerous, deserted downtown neighborhood
Looks more like "war torn Beirut", burnt out cars and trash
The 18 year old's father, naked to the waist, walks from the family Mercedes over the footbridge carrying a pillowcase full of cash to a semi- derelict car on the opposite side with a white piece of fabric taped in the rear windshield and trunk open
He slams the pillow case in the trunk and leaves
- red stream of headlights separated from a white stream of taillights by a narrow median
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                        3
blare as a  stops
Eighteen, still blindfolded, is dumped on the median
The car pulls away
He stands there in the whirlwind
Pathetically for help
More horns, shouts, no help
Goes to black
' Ezekiel 25:17 Blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children
: ' -   - Samuel Valencia Ramos and his lawyer Jordan Kalfus in the privacy of an alcove table
Jordan is well heeled, well connected and well oiled
In that order
Samuel, at 40, already has the patrician look that has served the male members of his family for generations
They discuss the kidnapping, a headline on the paper Jordan tosses aside
The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later
(laughs; chews) His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass
And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards
My own wife included
If she pisses you off, you get another one
(laughs grimly) Do you know what she told me last night
: -   -   - Samuel sits at his baby    grand piano playing a gentle rendering of 'Delibes'
His American wife  stands away from him
Just the     sight of her back reveals a pitch perfect petulance
She tells him: Work in Progress 2/10/03                                       4
man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes
Only the amount matters
And bankruptcy
Where will that put me in the social strata
'm only asking for one thing
And it's not an extravagance
It's not even for me; it's for our daughter
Our daughter
She turns at that: a woman so beautiful it nearly hurts to look at her
She stares, plays him like Chinese Checkers
Our child's safety is at stake
(stops playing) These people are professionals
They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt
Samuel, it is not something we should skimp on
bodyguard's presence in the car or outside the school was at least some form of deterrent
Now he's gone, feel totally exposed
She just stares at him
He melts
: ' -   - Jordan smiles at his client, enjoys seeing him squirm
Of course  care about Pinta
She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day
Yeah
And if she was ugly
Samuel rolls his eyes
Jordan laughs
Beheading two cigars, he passes one to Samuel
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                5
All my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance
have a policy,
It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard,  will not be able to renew it
know you need to please Lisa
An ass like that is hard to find
Good bodyguards are even harder
(interrupts) know
just had to let one go because couldn't afford him
Jordan lights his cigar
You need a bodyguard of some description
It's a dangerous world we live in
But you will get what you pay for
He doesn't need to be Superman, does he
Can you go fifteen grand
For a year
For a few months
Hire someone cheap
You have to have a bodyguard to keep the insurance
Then fire him for incompetence
The important thing is Lisa's daughter will return to school
Samuel finally follows the logic
And Lisa will be able to save face
We won't be the only family without a bodyguard
Her beauty fucks with your mind
For an American she understands this country very well
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   6
She understands men
As Samuel puffs his cigar in satisfaction
-    - As a 747 is towed by in the background, a  strides at us
Even in movement, he has a stillness, an air of isolation
He's set apart from other living things
He wears dark sunglasses, carries a well-worn leather bag
Inscrutable
Disconnected
bit frightening
The discipline of a soldier
The independence of a gunslinger
Automatic baggage teller (Red Light, Green Light)
Creasy feeds the machine with his perforated customs card
Light flashes
He flips through Creasy's passport
Even the stamps have stamps
Thailand
Somalia
Cuba
Columbia
Hong Kong
Saudi Arabia
Every country in Europe
Guy's been around
Customs looks up from the ink blue American Eagle to the deep matte black of Creasy's sunglasses
:    Italics denotes the lines spoken in Spanish
Where are you coming from
South America
Where are you staying in Mexico
'm on to Juarez
Why
have a friend there
Customs looks at Creasy a moment
He doesn't look like a man who has 'friends'
Finally, customs smiles
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   7
cannot see your eyes, Senor
Creasy slips off the sunglasses
His eyes are deserted
Inevitable
Customs can only look into them a moment
He indicates for Creasy to put his bags on a conveyor belt leading to an -ray machine
Creasy lifts his bag onto the conveyor
The official hits the start button
The bag drives forward towards the -ray machine
Creasy pauses, then offers up a license from his wallet
Senor
It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia
The gun you're about to find in that suitcase
Polaroid Shot of Creasy straight on
Shot of Creasy profile
Fingers being fingerprinted
- suitcase being stripped and ripped ( ), pack of Marlboro, bottle of Jack Daniels, glimpse a weathered Bible (New Testament), intercut with seven pieces of blue steel separated in different parts of the bag, ie
toiletries, underwear, lining of suitcase
The seven pieces laid together look remarkably like a well travelled Sig Sauer 226
Creasy smiles
,     ' - - - Six Japanese  jabber on cellphones sits up front trying not to spill coffee on the mini Uzi cradled in his lap
As his own cell phone rings, he answers
Rayburn here
-   - Creasy on payphone
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                        8
When did Mexican Customs start getting smart
's Creasy
Where the fuck are you
'm here
's What do you mean, 'm here
'm in a Customs holding tank in Mexico City International
Bring a bunch of cash
about 5K
'm going to need it
- Rayburn has 5K
dollars laid out on      the desk between him, the Customs official, and Creasy
The remains of the suitcase are spread around the room
The main offender, the gun being front and center      next to the cash
Looks like the official is going       to fold
This is going to cost you big time
- Rethink Location stripper does a half hearted grind as Rayburn and Creasy sit at the bar sharing a bottle of 'Jack'
You got a secondary search and you had a gun
Listen it was a calculated risk
've done it a million times and never got caught
Everything happens once if you live long enough
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     9
It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane
This is Mexico, they do everything backwards
Creasy hits the 'Jack'
So what's wrong
Nothing wrong
Don't give me that bullshit
Creasy changes subject
So how's business
Japanese are here in a big way
Cheap labor
Factory space
But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso
ferry 'em back and forth
They think 'm John-fucking-Wayne
But don't you stay in El Paso
Fuck,  love Mexico
live like a king down here
Creasy takes a look around the Seedy Bar
Yeah, right
Oh, like you haven't been in worse places
And a level five shithole is better than a level six
Your logic's inescapable
Rayburn laughs
Creasy takes the bottle
Creasy's hand is mottled by old burn marks
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                    10
You been working
Not for eight months
was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting
How long you staying, Crease
(shrugs) Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on
Just wanted to see you, how you were
Came by on impulse
Rayburn studies his friend a beat, just seeing the cracks that weren't there last time they met
You did something on impulse
Everything happens once if you live long enough
Creasy smiles
'  -   - Nine-year-old    stares out at the garden, a bit like Creasy, but only a ten yard stare
Pinta's eyes brim with life
She folds her hands, closes her eyes, prays
'Chopin' drifts up from downstairs
Samuel on the baby grand
Dear God
do not ask for health
Or wealth
People ask you so often that you can't have any left
Give me God what you still have
Give me what no one else asks for
Amen
Pinta grabs a battered old   and climbs into bed
She pulls the covers up, looks over as her door opens
Lisa enters
Pinta is her daughter
You should be sleeping, baby
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   11
'm trying, mom
Lisa strokes her head, smiles
Good news
You're going back to school
(sits up; excited) When
Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard
It may take a few days, but you're going back
Pinta lets it sink in
Lisa kisses her goodnight
Could he speak English
Emilio couldn't speak English
We'll see
And thank your father in the morning
man always needs to be thanked
-   - Four 's blast along a desert highway on their way to pick up some Japanese businessmen
Rayburn rides shotgun, Creasy in the back
Rayburn looks like he slept in his clothes
Creasy looks crisp and clean
That's right, a bodyguard
Creasy looks at him blankly
Your Spanish is good enough
You certainly look the part
You're crazy
People would hire a has- been, Ray
drunk
Well, you'd have to keep it under control
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                  12
And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt
You do your best
They won't be paying you enough to perform miracles
Creasy just shakes his head
It's not exactly a scam, Crease
Even at half speed you're pretty damn good
bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time
Willing to talk
'm not good at that
So you'll be the silent type
People will appreciate that
Creasy shakes his head, looks out the window
What are you doing here
came to visit you
Bullshit
've known you fifteen years
You don't visit
bodyguard
Who's the guy
Samuel Ramos
Owns one of the plants in Juarez
The    Jap car industry is in the toilet
He's    trying to persuade Ford to partner with   him
think he's in trouble
He    asked me if  knew anyone he could trust
Oh, now you think  can be trusted
Take a job, Creasy
Breathe some air
Then decide if you want to
stick around or not
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                       13
Rayburn throws him a  from the glove box
Instructional tape on what  tell my clients about bodyguarding
Creasy looks back at Rayburn who's just a little too perceptive for comfort
-    - dark Mercedes maneuvers the turns
- Creasy at the wheel
Samuel sits in the back
Studying
You drive easily
Smoothly
Creasy doesn't answer, just drives
(') Were you provided with a gun
Yes
Show me, please
Creasy takes his right hand off the wheel, reaches under his jacket and passes back a beat-to-shit looking
(') What is it
Nine millimeter
Sig Sauer 226
Have you used this type before
Creasy just nods
Doesn't like the show and tell
Is it loaded
It's loaded
Samuel hands back the gun
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   14
You will meet my wife first
She would like it if you are presentable, polite and respectful
You'll be the fifth candidate she's seen this week
Samuel flips through a manila folder
Your resume is impressive
Nine years in the Army
Extensive counter terrorism work
shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state
What's the catch
(honest) drink
How does it affect you
My coordination
Reaction time
If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay
And what if amateurs try it
'll probably kill them
Is that likely
No
And no one is to know of your drinking problem
That includes my wife
As they pull up to the Ramos' impressive hacienda
-   -   - Where Lisa is flipping through  channels; Sky News, , etc
Each one showing some terrorist act - West Bank protest, Madrid car bombing
Samuel and Creasy, meanwhile, enter behind her
She clicks it off, looks back at them
The world of our children
How dare they
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                      15
(shrugs) It's war
The weakest suffer the most
You're American
So are you
(introducing) My wife, Mr
Creasy
Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr
Creasy
Lisa steps over, shakes Creasy's hand
Gives him a quick once over
(') Would you like a drink
Creasy doesn't hesitate, doesn't look at Samuel and has no irony in his answer
Thank you
Scotch and a little water
She steps to the bar to make it
-  ' Slightly sinister
Watching from the frame of the door
You've done much of this work before
Never
Samuel sells, covers for Creasy's reticence
He has experience in related work great deal of it
Do you have any family, Mr
Creasy
Creasy hesitates for an imperceptible beat
No
do not have family
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                          16
And then, somehow, Creasy is aware of being watched
His eyes flicker over, just in time to see
Crouched low
In the doorway
She stares back at him a beat, then disappears around the corner
Creasy frowns
Lisa steps over with Creasy's drink
Thank you
She makes a point of looking into his eyes
Creasy looks back into hers with complete indifference, something she has not experienced even from dying men
She abruptly turns away
Confused for a moment
Finally: Pinta
few moments and Pinta arrives
'Cool Hand Pinta'
Yes, mom
This is Mr
Creasy
Pinta walks over and very formally holds out her hand
Creasy shakes it
An odd beat
Pinta, show him to his room
Samuel reacts
Creasy got the job
This way, Mr
Creasy
What an actress
As he follows her out
Samuel sits at his baby grand and begins to play
think it's nice he's American
think it's fantastic
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     17
You realize that you've brought a killer into the house
Samuel is stopped short by that one
She steps over and kisses her husband on the cheek
Thank you
feel better now

- Pinta leads the way
All enthusiasm, away from her parents
150 pound black German Shepherd greets them
Sniffs Creasy's pant leg, unsure
Do you like dogs, Mr
Creasy
If they like me
Frank doesn't take to most people
Do you speak German
(in German) Ein Klines Bisschen
[ tiny bit
] Frank only responds to commands in German
He was trained in Frankfurt
My Dad loves the idea of having a dog around, but hates the fact he lives inside
Creasy follows her
Frank pads along after them
' Not like downstairs, but comfortable enough
We fixed the room up two weeks ago
Mom and
It's nicer than before
Creasy takes a stroll around it, ignoring her
You've got a  player if you like music
like music a lot
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                    18
Creasy looks over at a  on a stand holding a It tilts its head at the big man
and  machine in the corner
That's 'Bird
' Emilio forgot to take him with when he left
Who's Emilio
My last bodyguard
He drove me to school in the morning and picked me up in the afternoon
Finally Creasy turns, looks at her hard
'm here for you
Pinta smiles huge, nods
In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch
Does that sound alright, Mr
Creasy
Creasy
Just call me Creasy
(big grin) Creasy
Frank's tail wags imperceptibly
Looks like he approves of you
And then, walking on air, she's out the door
Creasy sets up his room with meticulous precision that comes from years in the military
Front and center he arranges his shrine: an almost empty bottle of scotch and a glass (engraved from an earlier encounter) next to a pack of Marlboros and his weathered Zippo
Then, his beaten up gun and holster
well-travelled New Testament is placed in the drawer
' Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     19
He reaches in between the shirts, pulls out a fresh bottle of scotch
He breaks the seal, unscrews the cap
He pours a double
triple
wait, what do you call a full glass of scotch
The macaw squawks it's disapproval
He ejects the shell from the breach of the 9mm, tries to catch it on the back of his hand
An old game with himself
His hand is too shaky
The bullet bounces off, hits the floor
Creasy picks it up
Ejecting the magazine, he starts to oil the weapon
As the macaw squawks, Creasy looks up
It doesn't feel like this relationship is going to work
'  - battered   watches as Lisa sits on the foot of the bed, tucks Pinta in
School tomorrow, baby
Pinta smiles, happy at the thought
like him, Mom
You do
He's like a great big bear
(a secret smile) 'Creasy bear'
Lisa smiles, kisses her goodnight
As she starts out
There's something about him
Lisa turns, looks back at her daughter
think he's been sick
He's alright now, but  think he's been very, very sick
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     20
Well, think about going to sleep
Good night, baby
Lisa exits
Pinta looks over at the battered teddy bear
Just like you, a big old bear
: In his room
Tests his mag spring with his thumb, begins loading up
The full magazine joins with those already loaded
Another glass of scotch is poured
Creasy's hands oil the holster
The Sig Sauer is slipped in
The holster is hung over the corner post of the bed
map is flattened
Creasy's finger traces various routes, pencils them in
From the house to Pinta's school
The macaw squawks again
Creasy steps over, takes the cage and carries it to the open window
He opens the cage door
Now's your chance
The bird flies, disappears out the window
& '  - Spent, glistened in sweat, the couple lay side by side
She likes him
Hmm
Creasy
Pinta likes him
Pinta loves school
She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   21
Lisa just smiles, knows her daughter better
: ' Creasy's drinking in the dark next to the window, listening to the sounds of Mexico City at night
The empty scotch glass is set down
Ominously sober
'  - Brushing her hair, Pinta wanders to the window at the sound of a car hood closing
Creasy is down below going over the car; a dark
As he checks underneath
The "Car Wash Guy", Pedro, trying to engage Creasy
Frank looks on, seems like he disapproves of Pedro
- Creasy sits grimly behind the wheel
Pinta exuberant beside him
Traveling route number one from home base to school
Pinta looks at Creasy's hands on the wheel
The back of the right one is swirled with scars
Where are you from, Creasy
The United States
know
But which state
Creasy checks the rearview mirror
banged up white pulls out behind him
No state in particular
Pinta frowns; this is going to take some work
My mom and me are from Houston, Texas
Have you been there
Creasy has his eyes on the mirror
No
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   22
You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you
(turns left) No
Why not
'm looking for potential
Creasy checks the mirror
The white Corolla continues the way it was going
False alarm
Potential
don't understand
Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out
But you don't have to understand
do
So no talking
Are you going to quit
My last bodyguard quit
Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking
Someone gave him more money than we could
'm a bargain
Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico
Time will tell
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days
Four a day
What do you think about that, Mr
Creasy
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     23
Pretty impressive
Maybe  need to up my fee or get a larger gun
She looks at his scared right hand, then him
All curiosity
-   - Creasy pulls the Mercedes up out front
He notes the high walls, the heavy gates
Beep the horn
Creasy hits it
beat and then a   shutter opens at eye level
Pinta waves from the car
moment later the gate is being slowly pushed open by  an old
Creasy drives in toward a rambling,  ivy-clad building set in spacious grounds
Creasy parks, get out of the car
He looks around, appraising the lay of the land
Isn't it beautiful
Pinta's name is called
An elderly gray-haired  walks over from the entrance
Pinta runs over, kiss her warmly on both cheeks, then leads her toward Creasy
Sister Anna, the headmistress
(to nun; proudly) This is Creasy, my bodyguard
Sister Anna shakes his hand
Mr
Creasy
No, Sister, he told me just to call him Creasy
He's American
From no state in particular
You must look after our Pinta
We're so happy to have her back in school
Run along now, Pinta
Pinta waves goodbye, bounds away
They watch her go
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   24
She's late, Mr
Creasy
Yeah, 've got to get used to the routes
-- It won't happen again
No offense, but 'm sorry that your profession needs to exist
So am , Sister
Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do
Not for a long time, sister
The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good
" Romans, chapter 12, verse 21
Sister Anna is impressed
She nods her 'props' to Creasy
'm the sheep that got lost
-    - Creasy pulls out, starts down the street
He's only gone a hundred meters when  kick up
police car behind him
Creasy shakes his head
Here we go again
Creasy pulls over, digs around the front seat as head over
Do you speak English, Senor
Yeah
And Spanish
You have an identification

Creasy hands them his  and a printed legitimate firearms license for bodyguard work witnessed by Rayburn
Creasy deliberately puts one hand on the steering wheel, then the other
Minimizing the confrontation
It's a temporary license for the gun 'm carrying
just went through all of this at the airport
-     - Six Japanese  jabber on cellphones
Rayburn's daily routine
He sits up front an Uzi cradled in his lap
As his own cell phone rings, he answers
Rayburn here
Creasy, what's up
(listens; laughs) Yeah
: -  - As Creasy's   is flashed
'  - As he's fingerprinted
There's still ink on my fingers from last week
: ' You got tossed
Don't trust the cops, especially the Judicials

-   - Creasy striding, the frivolous shoppers like another species as he moves through them
Might as well wear a shark fin
He spots something: a

There
As he pulls a particular , we are not privy to what it is
- '  - Creasy waits, smoking a Marlboro light, separate from the other drivers and bodyguards
The bodyguards stand together sharing cigarettes and stories
Give him a share of unfriendly looks
Creasy could care less
The doors open and the children pour out
exits, a huge grin as she spots Creasy
Creasy palms the Marlboro
The frown on his might as well be chiseled in marble
-  - Pinta rides shotgun alongside Creasy
She looks out the window, realizes
We're taking a different way home
That's right
Pinta thinks about it, realizes what he's doing, smiles
understand
Smart
No answer from Creasy
It's hard not to feel foolish around this kid
Did you like school, Creasy
No
Not at all
No
But why not
Creasy's hoping she'll just shut up
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                    27
Hmmm
It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna
So you were unhappy
Being unhappy is a state of mind never thought about it
Oh
Pinta watches Creasy a moment, trying to figure a way in
She looks at his scarred right hand on the wheel
Then, as she reaches out
What happened to
And touches it
your hand
Creasy gives her a look, devoid of humanity for an instant
No more questions
When he speaks again he's colder; he's decided something
'm not paid to be your friend
'm paid to protect you
They drive on in silence
Creasy finally glances over
Pinta stares straight ahead, her chin quivering
(exasperated) And don't start crying
'm not crying
But she is
As Creasy stops at a red light
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                      28
Look, this is the way  am
don't like questions
-- And she's out the door
Shit
Creasy shoulders open his door, bolts out
Creasy has barely straightened himself and Pinta is already getting back in the car
This time in the backseat
Creasy sighs
The light goes green
Scooters whine away and horns blare
Creasy sits back behind the wheel
You can take me home now, Mr
Creasy
Creasy looks back at her, but she stares straight ahead
As the chorus of horns continues, Creasy continues driving
-   - Creasy sits at the table   with the old gardener (we've seen him trimming   hedges and such in earlier exteriors)
Gomez's just    cleaned his plate and is going after any remnants with a   crust of bread
Creasy hasn't touched his

As she clocks Creasy's plate
'  - 'Chopin' drifts across the courtyard
Samuel is a very accomplished player
Creasy sits in a chair in the twilight by the window, a glass of scotch in his hand

Come in
The door opens
It's Lisa
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                  29
Mr
Creasy,  wanted to make sure you have everything you need
'm fine
Is the food alright
Maria tells me that you didn't eat
The food's fine
Sometimes  don't eat
(smiles) It insults Maria
Slip it to the dog if you have to
Do you mind if  talk to you for a moment
He shakes his head
Lisa glides into the room like a dancer, sits down at the foot of the bed
How are you getting along with Pinta
We'll be okay once she realizes 'm not a new toy
(smiles) Yes, she told me
Do you have children, Mr
Creasy
No
You should know they're tenacious when they want something
And Pinta wants to be friends
You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her
Right
beat and then Lisa nods
Look
Maybe this isn't going to work
Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone
more sociable
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                    30
No, you're right
You were hired to protect her, that's enough
'm confident you'll do that
Lisa stands, is about to start out when she sees his gun and holster hanging from the corner of the bed
It gives her pause
Something sexy about it and Creasy's proximity
didn't realize you had a gun
know that's silly to say
Creasy doesn't answer, just watches her
It makes it all seem so serious
It is serious, Mrs
Ramos
Please, it's Lisa
'll be coming with you tomorrow
have lunch with friends
Finally, Lisa just shrugs and disappears out the door
Creasy slugs down a gulp of scotch
'  - Pinta, blankets up, teddy bear beside her, says her prayer
Give me God what you still have
Give me what no one else asks for
Then, she listens as Linda Ronstadt's "Blue Bayou" starts to drift through the open window, down from the room above
"'m going back someday, come what may, to Blue Bayou
" '  - He stands in the dark, in front of the glow of the stereo
The empty bag from the record store
This is the  he bought
As the song ends, Creasy hits the back- up button
"Blue Bayou" begins again
Creasy takes the 9mm from its holster
As he sits back in his chair
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                    31
'  - Pinta listens to the music, figures a way to dance to it
'  - Creasy sits in the dark with his 'Blue Bayou'
Creasy does not look right
Holding the 9mm, he ejects the round, tries to catch it on the back of his hand
No good
He chambers another round
Tries again
Nope
Well 'll never be blue, my dreams come true, on Blue Bayou
'  - Pinta still dancing, finding a way to be with Creasy whether he knows it or not
Frank, the dog, watches her every move, perplexed
'  - As the song repeats, Creasy chambers yet another round
Feels like he misses a beat as he loads one shell into the chamber
Pinta sings along oblivious
Suddenly the barrel is at his forehead and the trigger has been pulled
No gun shot
click
Hammer against shell
Creasy is confused
He ejects the shell and catches it in the palm of his hand
Macro photograph / a small dimple on the back of the shell is the only evidence of his actions
Pinta still dances

Rayburn in bed with his beautiful 19-year-old Mexican and their four-year-old
As she leans down to kiss her son, a cellphone rings
Rayburn looks over at the nightstand there, one of them ringing
Rayburn finds it
Rayburn
Creasy
What's wrong
- Creasy stands at the edge of the drive, the house dark behind him
On his cell phone
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     32
said, have you ever had a nine millimeter round that just didn't go off
: Rayburn pulling away, sitting on the edge of the bed
You mean a misfire
mean nothing
The hammer came down and nothing happened
Dimple on the primer
've heard of it
Never happened to me though
Maybe the firing pin's off
Maybe
Creasy is troubled about it all to say the least
It's like we always used to say: a bullet always tells the truth
What were you shooting at
Creasy doesn't answer
He holds the bullet up, looks at it
(focusing; concerned) Creasy
Sorry  woke you, Ray
Creasy clicks off the phone
He starts back toward the house, but stops short again
There she is
Pinta
Standing in the window of her room
She's been watching him
It's like Creasy seeing her for the first time
And she's been watching him forever
No easy answer for it
They're connected somehow

It takes it place of honor front and center on the shrine
Next to the Marlboros and scotch
The New Testament is set down nearby

- Creasy asleep in his bed for the first time
-  - Silent Creasy driving
Lisa and Pinta in the back
Creasy steals a look in the mirror
Pinta stares straight ahead
But when Creasy looks away, Pinta steals a look at him
-   - As the mercedes crosses an intersection, a white turns right, pulls in thirty meters behind it
-  - Creasy clocks the Corolla, frowns
He pulls a piece of paper from his pocket
But nothing to write with
Pinta, do you have a pencil
go to school, don't
Sarcasm
He stays calm, doesn't let on what he's thinking
Please
Her little hand comes over the top of the seat with a pencil
Creasy takes it, slows to let the Corolla catch up
He squints into the mirror to read the plate
Lisa is oblivious, but as Pinta looks back over her shoulder
up ahead
Creasy lurches to a stop
The Corolla swerves around them disappears ahead
Sorry
The traffic takes some getting used to
As Creasy cranes for a view, another  Corolla comes by headed the opposite way
They're everywhere
This relaxes Creasy's paranoia
As he laughs to himself
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                       34
-   - They pull in through the gates
The Mercedes parks; Creasy gets out
Pinta kisses her mother on the cheek
Bye, Mom
Don't forget your towel
Pinta gets out with book bag and her      towel
As she starts to walk past Creasy without a      word, he holds out her pencil
She holds up, shows him       a  , continues on her way
Doesn't need       him
Creasy gets back in, starts away
She has swimming practice today
You'll need to pick her up at the pool
Creasy just nods
He doesn't want anything to do with Lisa either
Thoughtful, Lisa looks out the window
talked to her
She understands
She won't bother you anymore
As Creasy just drives
' -   - Creasy waits in the street, stands by the Mercedes
He checks his watch, looks around
The minutes do not pass quickly
He looks over as the restaurant door opens and Lisa exits with Jordan Kalfus and his Latin wife
(sees him) Creasy
(stepping over) Meet Jordan and Evelyn
Creasy nods
They study him with interest
So you're the bodyguard
(Creasy nods again) You used to be, what did they used to call it, a soldier of fortune
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                 35
Jordan doesn't quite hide his disdain
Creasy nods a final time, lets his eyes drift to a 1000 yard stare
(giggles) Does he talk
As Lisa gives her a dirty look, Evelyn whispers
He's sexy
Jordan looks in the direction Creasy looks
You see any danger out there
(laughs) The fear's worse than the reality
Just a blankness from Creasy
always wanted to ask a bodyguard, would you take a bullet for your employer, for Samuel
condescending smile as Jordan awaits his answer
wasn't hired to guard Mr
Ramos
For Pinta then
Jordan
If something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her
have skills in that respect
Pinta would benefit by the fact that
'm a soldier
What kind of an answer is that
The answer is the truth
The question is foolish
Lisa smiles at the answer, kisses Jordan on the cheek
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     36
Jordan, thank you for the lovely lunch
promise not to let Evelyn spend too much
Evelyn doesn't see it, but Creasy does
Jordan just lets his fingers trace the top of Lisa's ass
As she and Evelyn head for the car, Creasy is there to open the door
Creasy gets behind the wheel
Pulls into traffic
As he goes, he checks the rear view mirror
Jordan remains standing on the curb watching the car pull away
Something odd about it all
-   - Loud
Chaotic
Reminiscent     of a lunatic asylum
Creasy arrives at the public pool

Several bodyguards gather at one end   of the pool
Give Creasy a less than friendly look
As    he looks for Pinta

Sees: The smoke from the starting pistol as the splash into the water
He sees Pinta in the pool
The fifty yard dash
She's in fifth
Then fourth
Creasy walks along beside her
Third
Second and closing
And at the wall, still second
She surfaces, frustrated
As she sees Creasy there

Pinta in back, writing in her notebook
Not speaking, but a weird sort of harmony
Finally
You're fast

By the time  catch up, it's too late
She keeps writing

Creasy does a pretty good impersonation

Do you think he'll come back

It's better to be free, right
Yes
Actually, he was driving me crazy
Creasy disappears back inside
Pinta smiles big before letting the stick drop to the ground

Blue Bayou plays
Pinta now listens to Creasy's sound

They're on their way, kissing Pinta goodbye
'll call you from Detroit, baby
You're going to miss Mexican Halloween

You enjoy it for us, Pinta
Lisa gives her a look
Don't make this harder than it has to be
Finally, Pinta nods
Creasy waits quite a discreet distance away by the Mercedes
She steps over, stops to wave goodbye one last time, then gets in back
As Creasy shuts the door

She wipes away a tear just as it forms
They'll be back in a week
They can stay for two weeks

The food is excellent, Maria
You have a real talent
Maria beams with pleasure
My pleasure, Creasy
Pinta enters  in a   '
She looks a bit forlorn  as she sits at opposite ends of the table from Creasy
As she stares at her plate, Creasy starts to laugh at  what an odd sight she is
All dressed up and no place to  go
Wrong move
Pinta stands, marches out of the room
As Maria and Creasy exchange a look

Then there it is
The macaw
Sitting on the opposite roof
-   - Pinta pushes it open, climbs out onto the slope of the roof
This doesn't look like such a good idea
As she crosses, disappears over the peak
It's a game of catch me if you can
'Bird' looks at Pinta right in the eye
She gingerly moves closer
The bird moves away, just out of her reach each time
Pinta coming down the other slope
There's the macaw
Come on
Come on

The fourth time Pinta's fingers are centimeters away
She reaches and suddenly slides along the slick tile covering this section of the roof
Frank's in the yard barking loudly
Near the edge, she manages to stop

She scrambles up a few feet

She slides again
This time right off the edge

She catches the rain gutter
Hangs thirty feet above the ground
concrete landing below
As the gutter creaks: - ' Creasy is on his feet, out the door in a heartbeat
- Creasy dashes around just as the gutter drops on one side
Pinta drops ten feet, jerks to a stop as the gutter stops, then drops the last twenty feet
landing in a hedge
Creasy dashes over
Pinta
She's in a lot of pain, but moving her arms and head
Frank's licking her face
It hurts

She puts her hands to the left side of her ribs
Creasy carefully probes with his fingers
She winces
don't think they're broken
Anywhere else

As Maria huffs and puffs her way up
'm going to get you out, okay
Pinta nods
Creasy eases his arms under, around her, lifts her out as gently as possible
She disappears in his arms

Oh, Creasy
And she bursts into tears

Begins to cross herself
It's okay
She's just scared
Creasy cradles her, pats her back
As Pinta says his name like a mantra

Fantastic in a black evening dress
The Ford car industry dinner awaits her entrance
You're sure she's alright
Samuel enters from the bathroom, concern on his face
Okay, good,   you're sure

Creasy looks at the bear

'm too old for him
Don't tell my friends
don't talk to them much
Does he have a name
Pinta thinks just a beat, then shakes her head 'no'
Liar

She sends her love
Pinta nods
Creasy stands there a beat, then heads for the door
Almost out, he looks back
Some bodyguard  turned out to be
Good night, Pinta
He's halfway out the door

Using crutches, Pinta hobbles over
Creasy opens the back door for her
But when she gets there, she hesitates

Concubine
Maria and Gomez wait to see how he'll answer
Well, it's a sort of wife

How can that be
In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules
It must be difficult having lots of wives
You feel sorry for the husband

So funny that Creasy smiles

No, no, come back

Pinta is stealing looks at Creasy's right hand
She knows the answer must be serious, but she has to ask
Creasy, what happened to your hand

Pinta practically holds her breath, watches him, knows the answer may come
Creasy checks the mirror, watches the road

He smoked a lot
There was no ashtray
That's it
End of explanation
Creasy continues watching the road
Pinta watches him
Remember you asked me what state  was from
Yes
Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events
Where you're from is what happened to you

Evelyn was right
Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy
No
Did you used to
Yeah

Lisa continues to watch the little play
She smiles, knocks on the door as she opens it
Pinta and Creasy both look back over their shoulders
Creasy, tomorrow, after you drop off Pinta, could you come back to take me to get my hair done
Creasy nods
They both continue to look at her
She gets the feeling she's interrupting
Alright, 'll leave you two to your history
As she goes
-   - Mexico City traffic is heavy
Cars and people
Creasy stands by the car across the street
Cooling his heels
He can just catch a glimpse of Lisa in the shop
Suddenly the traffic seems to finish, expending itself
The street goes ominously quiet

And the cop car disappears around the corner even as start toward the businessman
Lisa exits the hairdresser's
Looks stunning
Creasy starts across the street toward her
second car squeals around the corner behind the Mercedes and everything goes to Hell

And then Creasy is there
His arm around Lisa's waist, sweeping her off her feet
The next thing she knows she flattened on the ground in a shop doorway, Creasy on top of her
Shielding her
The bodyguard beside the businessman is killed
The body guard in the Mercedes trades a full magazine before he's shot

Liza screams as the glass above and behind them shatters
The businessman is hustled into the back of the second car
Lisa sees the gun in Creasy's hands
She hears the slamming of the car door, the screeching of tires
parked  also hauling ass out of there
But then she's aware of something else
Creasy on top of her
She feels his weight, his heat
Don't move
She watches as he rises, goes to the curb
One bodyguard is sprawled dead across the ground
Red blood on the sidewalk
As Lisa closes her eyes

Through the window we can see Creasy wrap up his statement to a member of the Finally he gets in the car, starts to drive

Nothing to do with me

If 'd started shooting his friends, he would've had me

Creasy's late
Then the gate swings back; the Mercedes drives through
Smiling, she hurries over, hops in the passenger seat
- (happy to see him) You're late
'm sorry
You were never late before,  was worried
Creasy doesn't answer
He actually looks guilty
Pinta watches him a moment

Where's my mother
dropped her at home
It's no wonder you're late
Why didn't she just come with you
Creasy doesn't answer, just grunts
Pinta keeps looking at him and it suddenly all makes sense
He looks over at her, starts to say something, then thinks better of it
Finally
Do you think my mother likes you
She's for sure pissed
Definitely aware and definitely jealous
Creasy's a bit amazed, not sure how to respond
think she's afraid of me
But not the same way most people are
Pinta considers this
Then
'm not afraid you, Creasy
know you're not

But not anymore

Pinta gets out of the Mercedes
Hi, Dad
He gives her a pat on the head
Simultaneously, Samuel fixes Creasy with a look, strides purposefully over
He thrusts out his hand, shakes Creasy's
want to thank you, Creasy
For what you did for my wife
Creasy wants to choke, but he just nods, looks past Samuel to Pinta who looks bemused
He doesn't even want to know exactly what she knows

Your father has business
Why today
And why'd she have to go with him

No comforting answer for her
He looks around at some of the other bodyguards
Good luck

But she's shaking her head adamantly
Determined

Okay,  think now is as good as time as any
She takes out a velvet pouch from her pocket
She holds it out to Creasy
He looks at her, takes it from her hand
His thick fingers fumble with a delicate drawstring
Pinta waits for his reaction as Creasy pours a simple, but fine  and chain into the palm of his hand

Creasy is really affected, tries to hide it
She takes it, slips it over his head
It's St

Could  stop you
You don't drink like you used to

My mom drinks, too
Why do people drink, Creasy
Now that's a question

For me, the problem isn't in the glass
The problem's in between my ears
You think too much
Yeah
Because at one time,  didn't think enough

Creasy
Why
You were so pleased with him
Pinta likes him too much
(a beat) She thinks of him as a father
That's ridiculous
It's not
Samuel thinks about it, is almost apologetic
've just been so busy, Lisa
He has to go
Samuel looks at her, wonders at her adamancy
The three month trial ends in a week just won't confirm the position
That possibility was understood when  hired him
Lisa gives him a look
She wants it done today
But for once, Samuel is stronger than his wife
won't create bad feelings
And another week won't make a difference
Off the escalator, they turn toward Creasy waiting unaware
It will be a hard break

Rayburn gets Creasy's arm over his shoulder, eases him off the gurney till his feet hit the floor
Creasy winces, but the two of them start to walk out

Lights out, engine off
It coasts a hundred yards before the engine turns over
Rayburn behind the wheel
As it sweeps past camera

No pursuit in sight
He looks over at Creasy
How do you feel
Creasy looks over at him, finally shrugs
Stomach's gone
But
okay
'll get you up to the border
Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego
Drop you right at the hospital
Creasy's not really listening
He's been looking in the passenger side view mirror

The reporter starts making notes; the photographer snaps photos of the shrine
Rosanna stands by the flower pyre
Something catches her eye
balled-up piece of paper and a half-burned candle beside it
As she picks it up, she spots something else
Across the street, Creasy walks
An awkward hitch in his stride
Outside the apartment of the piano teacher, surveying the scene with experienced eyes
Unaware of Rosanna () Corolla

Pinta screaming

There's Rosanna

We're interested in the same thing

There's a curse on you
It's a little late
He hands it back to her, not interested
As he turns to go
What are you going to do
Creasy doesn't answer

Creasy
There is a brotherhood called Le Hermanidad which protects both high ranking Government officials, corrupt police, and organized crime at a level that is very difficult for me to touch
believe you were a victim of this organization
You and this story may help to unmask them
Creasy looks carefully at Rosanna
Right now he trusts no one
Thank you
He walks away towards Rayburn

Rayburn grinds out another cigarette, mutters to himself

The    Pinta jotted for him
Then he notices the notebook is really a diary
Every page references her day to day relationship with Creasy
" love you Creasy Bear
" He hears soft footsteps
Creasy turns
Lisa stands in the doorway in her nightgown, her eyes drilling through Creasy
(softly) You let them take her
She loved you and you let them take her
Creasy just blinks at her as the words blast through him
Why are you here
Why didn't you die
Because

Eyes brimming, Lisa has no more words
But Creasy comes bearing cold comfort
want you   to know something

Anyone who opens their eyes   at me
Lisa doesn't answer, but the connection between them is suddenly monumental
Finally, Creasy looks away
He picks up Pinta's battered, old

He turns, but she doesn't look back at him
Kill them, Creasy
Creasy nods
He will
As he continues away

Leaves blow across the surface of the water
Underwater slow motion, a wall turn
It looks remarkably like Pinta
"Blue Bayou" drifts through the air
Soft, in the ether somewhere
Creasy hears it, half raises his head
' Why Blue Bayou, Creasy
Is that where you're from
She's standing behind him
Wearing the all too familiar one piece swimsuit, she towels her wet hair
Blue Bayou is a dream, Pinta
Like you
Dreams are beautiful, Creasy-Bear, but life is better

The words are a salve, a balm

He's all alone

Clutching a teddy bear
Creasy gets in the car
Rayburn drives

Rayburn grinds out the cigarette he just lit, knows what just was asked
Creasy needs help unleashing a plague

Creasy hangs up

Rosanna hands the piece of paper with the license plate number to Manzano
He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything
He sounded strong to me
Stronger than we are
Rosanna pauses
Because he's outside
Because he's not tied to the same system we are

Then what do you have to lose
It's a moral issue
On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys
Finally deciding, Manzano turns, holds out his hand

We hear the scooter whine as Jorge crosses the street and enters a - Creasy watches and waits
Time lapse of the building Jorge exits the building still trying to get the last button of his police uniform closed
He's a cop
He struggles to get behind the wheel of the Fiat
The car is tiny
Someone's getting in on the passenger side
As Jorge starts to protest, Creasy rams a Sig into his gut
At the same time, he takes Jorge's gun from its holster
Drive

You are Jorge Ramirez
Creasy jams him in the gut again

Jorge starts the engine

Gravel crunches under the Fiat's tires as it drives to the edge of a cliff
' Stop here
Turn off the ignition
500 - Jorge does as he's told
Suddenly the Sig comes down hard
As Jorge's vision explodes
500 - Still in the driver's seat, Jorge wakes
The first thing he sees is that his hands are taped to the steering wheel with his pudgy white fingers exposed
He is naked, reminiscent of the 18 year old in the opening sequence
Can you hear me
Jorge nods, the pain in his head blinding
am going to ask questions
If you don't answer, fully and truthfully, you will suffer much more than you have to
Creasy opens Pinta's notebook to a blank page near the end
He clicks open a pen
Creasy presses in the car's cigarette lighter
Then he opens a buck knife
Jorge winces at the sound of the blade locking

If  have to
The cigarette lighter pops back out
That's to cauterize the stubs

Holy sweet Jesus
Sweat drips down Jorge's forehead
He tries to master his fear
Swallows dry
Do you know who  am
Who are you

Without warning Creasy reaches up with the buck knife, a flash of steel
The big man howls, his left ear suddenly missing, starts an epic struggle, practically breaking the wheel off the steering column
He is like a bucking Rhinoceros
He howls as Creasy sprays his face with pepper spray
500 - The passenger side door opens and Creasy stumbles out
Some of the pepper spray has gotten in his face as well
Creasy wipes his tearing eyes
And then he turns
Hefting the knife in his hand, he marches back toward the car

Who's he

She has been bound and taped around the mouth and eyes
Creasy looks like he'll kill him on the spot

Creasy cocks the trigger

As Manzano considers this, likes it, Rosanna takes the card out from her bra
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                      101
And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well
(as he takes card) should start going for your tits first
-   - Underwater as Pinta swims
As she spins, kicks off the wall, it's Creasy who comes out the other side
plume of red blossoming off his side
This is done over and over, faster and faster, closer and closer
The blood becomes darker, bigger
And we push into that blood until it's finally obscuring everything
-   - row of newspapers being set out
Creasy's face on the front page of every one of them
- quaint old Mexico neighborhood
We follow a long canvas bag being carried through the streets
Carried by Creasy
Toward the end of the street and a ground floor apartment
Walks past a canary yellow Coup deVille, which has seen better days
- An elderly couple eating lunch
The  looks over at a knock on the door
He stands, answers it
Creasy slides in, eases the door shut behind him
Gun in hand
'm not here to hurt you
need to borrow your house and your car
Are you the proud owners of the Coupe deVille
- military operation as Tazinari is led out to his car
Two heavy gray sedans wait
Tazinari gets in the back of the second car with his --
The door is shut behind them
The door closes with an hermetic whump
The two cars pull away toward the opening
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                    102
- Creasy has just finished taping the old couple to two chairs
If you promise to speak softly and not to shout,  won't have to tape your mouths
The old man looks to his wife, then back to Creasy
Nods
The old man watches as Creasy opens he canvas bag, pulls out two metal tubes that he screws together
It's a Next he pulls out a cone-shaped missile
The old man is starting to look curious
Did you know you have a dishonest policeman living in your neighborhood
Creasy depresses the fins on the missile and slides it back into the tube
know of you
You're the American
The bodyguard who's killing the kidnapper
Creasy doesn't answer, steps into the center of the room
In the church, they say to forgive
Forgiveness is between them and God
It's my job to arrange the meeting
Creasy looks back and forth between two shuttered windows and in a line to the wall with a household Catholic alter
Christ on the cross sits front and center
Do you have an old blanket you don't care about
don't want to burn that wall
- figure rises, framed in the window
And Pinta stands beside him
As she puts her fingers in her ears
Creasy looks back over his shoulder, but of course she's not there
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                      103
Creasy fires the rocket launcher
gout of flame erupts from the back
But Creasy has hung a blanket on the wall
- Eyes widening as the first rocket streaks toward them
The driver stands on the brakes
The car explodes, is obliterated really, from the inside out
- Tazinari's car slams into the debris of the lead car and slides sideways against a wall wedging it in
Real tight
: 'Man On Fire' strides through the smoke and dust shotgun at his side and a Molotov cocktail in his left hand
Without missing  a stride he unloads both barrels into the drivers window
scary prospect even though it's bullet- proof
The lit   Molotov explodes beneath the car
Silence
Then a   dull impact explosion
30 feet of flames envelope  the car
The driver and Tazinari both prisoners inside  their own car
The driver exits releasing a full clip from his Uzi
Creasy nails him with a single shot to the head
Tazinari exits through the flames hands high in the air
: -   - There sits the canary yellow Coupe deVille
Eyes and mouth taped shut, hands and ankles bound by flex-cuffs
Tazinari stands there
Creasy steps up, pulls the tape off Tazinari's eyes
He looks about, relatively calm considering
You know where you are
As Tazinari tries to process

Under the bridge
Where the deal went south
Now why don't you tell me what went down
Creasy tears the tape off his mouth
Do you know who  am
am the commandante of the Judicial anti- kidnapping division
And one of the founding members of La Hermanidad
Correct
Creasy pulls the buck knife from his pocket, flips  it open
As Tazinari reacts, Creasy spins him round,   slits his clothes up from ankle to neck
The cloth drops   away, some hanging at Tazinari's wrists
Tazinari has a   sudden loss of attitude
: Close up: Tazinari hands being cuff flexed and tied to side view mirrors of the Coupe deVille
Cut back to see Tazinari, naked other than his Calvin Klein skivvies, spread-eagled across the grill of the car, butt forward (Reminiscent of 'the woods scene' in ) Creasy rips down his Calvins
of Tazinari's face winces with either pain or extreme discomfort
That's not my dick
That's the barrel of your own gun

It's all up to you, commandante
Tell me about you and 'The Dreamer'
Creasy puts a tape recorder on the hood and presses the record button

Lucky how
That he used policemen
That you killed them, it made it a police matter
The Ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement
And
And  had my men ready
You stole the drop

from opposite side of the bridge
from the drop car
See the money drop get ambushed by unknown faces
'The nephew' gets shot
The kidnapper running the show sounds like Woody Woodpecker, high pitched squeaky voice
(') You done it before
Tazinari doesn't answer
Creasy gives the Magnum a tweak
Yes
Many times
So tell me more
There was no ten million dollars
The ransom was ten

Two and a half
That's how much there was
Don't lie to me
Two and a half
The rest was paper
Strips of paper
:   Tazinari, in his office, sifting through the paper
Maybe your men stole from you
No
Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange
Who gave the bags to Ramos
His lawyer
Jordan Kalfus
: Ramos House
Bags of cash being switched from the Mercedes with the flat tire to the 2nd Mercedes in the garage
See that Jordan does the switch, four bags on the floor
: As Creasy thinks
Tazinari has been stretched to his limit
That's all  know
Please
'm sorry for the girl
But it was business
'm a professional
That's what everybody keeps saying
Creasy switches off the tape recorder and pockets it
Relief for Tazinari as the

In the middle of the cloud is Jordan face down floating on the surface dressed in his beige linen suit

Black holes where his eyes and mouth were
His ears missing

Just pissed that he's late

He swims the last few meters underwater
As he surfaces, Pinta waits by the edge
She nods in grim satisfaction

He isn't doing well
The cloud of deep red emanating from his stomach envelopes his whole body
- Samuel eats dinner silently
Lisa just stares into space, nursing a vodka
Even great marriages cannot survive the trauma of kidnapping and subsequent death
The door opens and they expect to see Maria with the deserts
Creasy enters and sits at the table like a dinner guest
(to Samuel) 'm going to talk to your wife
If you move or say one word, 'll kill you
He takes a Colt Officer model
45 semi-automatic pistol out of his waistband and lays it on the table in preparation for something, we don't know what
He turns to Lisa
'm going to tell you a story
Your lawyer is dead
Someone didn't want him talking
Last week he wired $2
5 million into his
bank account
Colonel Ernesto Tazinari is also dead
He hijacked the ransom drop, another $2
5 million
If my arithmetic is correct it means $5 million remains
Creasy looks to Samuel
Your husband magically had five million deposited in a
bank account last Friday
Lisa's eyes never leave Creasy's
trying to discern whether this is true or not
They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus
Planned what
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     109
An autosequestra
Kalfus arranged for Pinta to be taken to a safehouse
'm sure he thought she'd sit there for three days eating pizza and watching
It didn't work out that way
Everything got fucked up when  killed the cops and Tazinari saw an opportunity
Lisa screams
Creasy gestures with a finger to his lips
On the surface it was low risk and high return
This was the third autosequestra Jordan had organized for clients
The other two succeeded
Samuel looks to Lisa
Our lifestyle was in jeopardy
My pain and weakness only fueled your anger and determination
wasn't sure about whether to go through with it or not
Then  woke up one day and it was done
(beat) Jordan was supposed to take care of it
Through all of the above, Creasy removes the special bullet held in the seam of his wallet
The misfire
He empties the other cartridges from his gun
Lisa suddenly attacks Samuel in a violent, emotional outburst of tears, screaming, and rage
Drawing blood from his nose and upper lip
Samuel smothers Lisa's arms beneath his
He appears strong and decisive for the first time
Creasy very carefully takes the bullet, puts it into the magazine and chambers the round
He looks into Samuel's eyes
bullet does not lie
bullet tells the truth
And the truth will set you free
Creasy hands Samuel the gun
In many ways  think this bullet should be shared between you and Lisa
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                    110
Creasy exits the room
Samuel kisses Lisa on the forehead and exits onto the terrace
- Lisa just sits
Where will she find air to breathe
- Life moves on with its brutal inevitability
This is a river whose course cannot be altered
' From the backseat  can see   Creasy's eyes in the mirror
He watches    and thinks
He never smiles
wish     was back in the front seat with him
wish he would smile
Creasy looks up from the notebook and out at the city
And a smile comes
But it's bitter and hopeless
It's half grief, half not knowing where to go next, what to do
And he's dying
He knows that too
Creasy dials a number on a cell phone

We see she's sitting in the Operations Center amongst Technicians, surveillance and listening devices, and Manzano
We can hear the interior of a family house, kids, a frustrated mother, a Mexican soap playing in the

But no males that sound anything like 'The Dreamer'
He'll show
Manzano is carrying a 8"  10" digital blow up of a handsome Mexican John Gotti type in some nightclub environment
Who's that
He's the man, 'the Boss
' My guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots
We had to inject the whole Barrio
We bugged the house and stole the picture of him
Manzano looks at Rosanna
Now's the time to really pressure him
Lets publish his picture in tomorrow's edition
Rosanna understands the consequences makes light of them
So how are going to recipricate
Manzano discreetly slides his hands up her crotch

Her driver exits and opens her door
She steps out
But waiting inside is a welcoming committee
wielding a shotgun who shoots the driver in both knees

pale attempt at    disguising his identity
There's a newspaper folded on   his dais, more photos of Creasy, his dead targets, the   story of his vendetta

This way
Empty restaurant, chairs  on tables
An    exterior streetlight illuminates  the darkness
The owner leads him down a row of empty  booths
Creasy    slows, stops as he sees the only person  waiting for him   is Manzano
As Manzano smiles

Man On Fire
That's what the papers have named you
It's what you and Rosanna named me
Right

Sit, Creasy
Everything that happens from now on does so with my permission
(smiles) Really
You won't find a better carne asada in all of Mexico
The table is covered in an arrangement of the best food you will ever find in Mexico
Creasy sits
(laughs at himself) The last few days may represent the best police work of my life
What do you want
The same thing as you
Except, my reach isn't as long as yours
My father was a policemen, did you know that
don't know shit about you
He was one of the original founders of 'Le Hermanidad' in the days when it represented good not evil
Manzano smiles; he likes Creasy
He was murdered
And now here  am
Trying to honor his memory
Hamstrung by bureaucracy and corruption
The organization that he began now protects criminals at the highest level where would need a Presidential finding in order to expose it
or you
The  steps over; Manzano waves him off
My family lives in Miami
Because of the death threats
It's not worth it
Be with them instead
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   114
It galls me to watch you
You can do as much in days as  can in years
Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected
Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours
Are you going to arrest me or talk me to death
Manzano laughs again
Genuine
Creasy cracks him up
My country needs justice
Proper justice
Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence
They need to be brought to trial
Dealt with properly
Then people will respect the law
When they see it works
So you are going to talk me to death
You walk out and deal justice
You're what  wish  could be
(another laugh, then a beat) The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want
Then  hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids
What do you want
want to arrest you for murder
want to shake your hand and reload your gun
want to kill my pride and give you my blessing
My deal is with Rosanna

Are you two fucking
No, but  have to admit  thought about it

You have no interest in making things easy, do you
'm not

Manzano reaches into his pocket
He pulls out a folded and a
He hands the bottle out first
Percodan
imagine you need handfuls by now
Creasy makes no move to take it
Manzano sighs, sets it down in front of him
Regarding the paper
Account belongs to a woman we think is The Dreamer's girlfriend
Reina Rosas, who is 8 months pregnant
Creasy holds his hand out
Manzano hesitates
The plan is the girlfriend will lead you to the Boss
You'll lead me, and 'll arrest him
Agreed
Creasy doesn't respond
Finally Manzano gives him the paper, a mimeographed mugshot, and address scrawled on it
Creasy stands
As he scoops up the pills
Creasy starts out

empty eyes of poverty looking back
mostly women and children
They clearly see Creasy

children looking directly through his absent windshield
One skinny kid runs ahead of Creasy
The boy points at one cardboard house propped up against a brick and stucco wall

She turns and looks
It looks remarkably like her even under the hooded sweatshirt
She begins to run
Across the street, up the steps toward Creasy

Time stands still and the 'city sounds' fade out to nothing
She runs up the remaining stairs and sprints across the bridge
Her hood blows off revealing her full face
It's definitely Pinta
Camera ramps as he jumps into Creasy's arms
This is not the little girl we experienced in the beginning of the movie
The experience she just endured has been life changing
All of a sudden we have a 40 year old head on an 8 year old body
She wraps herself around him
He picks her up
We glimpse a simple tear on his cheek
They talk
But we do not hear the words
She notices her mom on the far side of the bridge
Creasy maneuvers her toward Lisa
Before she goes to her mother we hear: love you, Creasy
And you love me, right
Creasy nods
The inference is that he will see her in a few minutes

As the car pulls out, time slows, and we see Creasy lay his head back and close his eyes as the car descends down into a dark tunnel
Pinta can see Creasy's face, eyes slowly closing
He can hear her screams before being enveloped by the night
As "Blue Bayou" continues
- Dark spot in the road
Suddenly Police lights, on the roofs of four cars, flash simultaneously in front, in blocking position
The driver turns and looks back wanting to escape
He has a blacked out  armored van right on his rear bumper
Nowhere to go
at his door
He's pulled and proned out onto the road
Manzano enters the driver's seat
Reaching back to Creasy
Grabs his hand
'm your chauffeur now, Creasy
Manzano does a -turn
Heading away
On his portable radio
All units
Commence the operation
Repeat
Commence
He reaches back again
Creasy
Creasy
- Two hands clasp
Creasy's left with Manzano's right
strong grip
Then no response
Manzano pulls to the curb
Manzano reaches Creasy's wrist
Takes his pulse
Creasy's gone
Beat
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     126
Manzano kneels
Still holding Creasy
Unfolds Creasy's fingers
- Pinta's medallion of St
Jude clutched in his hand
Manzano punches the seat again again and again
Goddamn you
'  -   - Manzano looks at Creasy and makes a decision
(keys mic) Hold at the perimeter
Until  enter
' Dark, suburban Cuernavaca street
Creasy's car rounds the corner
Security outside the compound motions to open the garage doors
The driver of the car is faceless
Street light reflections across the windshield
The car enters the gates
collection of armed bodies appear in the courtyard curious to see this national hero
"Hombre en Fuego
" The car stops
Nothing
This beat seems interminable
hand opens the rear door: His forehead explodes
The driver door opens barely two shots, two more bodies drop
Panic and confusion
Everybody runs for cover
An overhead helicopter illuminates the mayhem in the courtyard
An armored vehicle rams through the gates
Manzano explodes out of the driver's door in slow motion
He is clearly on a mission
He strides through the mayhem, Creasy's Sig Sauer in one hand, and a
45 auto in the other
Manzano's guide to his destination is the 'The Dreamer's' little Jack Russell running back to his master on instinct
Manzano moves purposefully
His surrounding environment is Chaplinesque in its chaos
He enters a long walkway to a patio, following the dog
Daniel Sanchez appears at the end of the hall
We ramp him into slow motion
The Mexican version of Gotti
He raises his arms, prepared for the inevitable
The outcome is a given
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                  127
Manzano unloads a magazine into him and we - :    "  " ' Ezekiel 25:17
Blessed is he  who in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children
