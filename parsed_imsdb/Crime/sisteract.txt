: '  - ,  - We are in a parochial school classroom, in the late Sixties
The children all wear uniforms and sit at little desks
stands at the front of the room; she is a middle-aged nun, very severe
The children are all terrified of her
Who can name all the Apostles
Yes
thirteen-year-old girl sitting at a desk
She raises her hand
Christine
Sister, may  be excused
Christine
It's an emergency
Real bad
Sister Immaculata nods, pursing her lips
Christine stands and heads for the door
: Christine is now in the deserted St
Anne's girls room
She is standing on tiptoes, looking in the mirror
She has taken her hair out of its neat barrettes; she is combing it out
She applies lipstick
Christine reaches into her schoolbag; she pulls out a stack of glittery bracelets and slips them on
She unbuttons the top few buttons of her stiff white blouse
She sprays herself with dime store cologne
: Christine opens the girls' room door; she looks both ways
No one is around; she saunters down the hall
Page 2
Christine opens this door
She looks into the closet
There is a very nervous thirteen-year-old  waiting for her inside
Hi, Jimmy
Christine slips inside the closet and closes the door behind her
Striding down the hall, with a bloodthirsty look in her eye, and a nasty-looking wooden ruler in her hand
She flings open the broom closet door, in the broom closet
Jimmy's face is covered with lipstick
Christine's hair is awry
The couple has clearly been making out
(outraged) Miss Christine Carter
Again
Don't you know what happens to girls like you
Don't you know what they become
'  -    , - () Taped over a crack on a wall
The poster shows a glittering   :  singing star of a fifth- rate Vegas lounge
Christy wears tight spangles and a major wig on the poster
She has clearly lived up, or down, to all of Sister Immaculata's expectations
The   through the dark bedroom in which the poster hangs; a neon sign flashes outside the window, casting a red and blue haze over the premises
dressing room table is cluttered with dozens of bottles of nail polish and makeup, and garish clothing and flashy jewelry are scattered everywhere
We hear the movement of   as someone sits up in the dark
' Come on, Vince -- hold me a minute
' 'd love to
babe -- but 've got to go
It was great
Like usual
' It was twenty minutes
Like usual

' The best
stands at the mirror, adjusting his clothing and checking his hair
Vince is a powerful, charismatic man who rules an organized crime empire with personal magnetism and threat
Vince's hold over Christy is obvious, if unfortunate; he can seem expansive and generous one minute, ruthless and dangerous the next
(half to Christy, half to the mirror) You are something else
Christy turns on a lamp and lights a cigarette
Come on -- stay
Just a little
We can talk, 'll get a pizza
Pizza in bed, we'll have fun
And you still haven't told me what happened
What did she say
What did who say
Who
The other woman
Your wife
Vince turns to face Christy, turning on the charm
You are so damn sexy
Vince
How did  get so lucky
What is it now, five years we've been together
Who do thank
(not buying it) Today was the deadline, Vince
Vince sits on the bed
He takes Christy's hand, and kisses it
want us to be together
Like people
Honest, decent people
In the eyes of God
Babe, today
went to confession
You did what
Page 4
For the first time in  don't know how long
wanted everything done right
Open and above board
told Father Antonelli  was in love
told him it was a special love, for all the ages
(starting to fall for it) You said that
And what did he say
Did he say you could leave her
Did he say we'd be happy
(looking deep into her eyes) He said that if  got a divorce 'd burn in Hell
For all eternity
Vince kisses Christy's hands again and drops turns away and starts putting on his shoes
What
(outraged) You want me to go against a priest
Get excommunicated
You think 'm nuts
You bastard
(trying to calm her) We can still see each other
Just like always
It's a different kind of sin
Smaller
You pig
Vince backs off, and starts searching for his jacket
Babe, it's not me
love you
It's God
You lying sleazeball
The best years of my life
What am , garbage
Am  lint
Vince ducks as Christy throws an ashtray at him, and it smashes against the wall
You're upset
understand
should go
hate to

- hits the wall beside Vince's head
Get out of here
And never come back
hits the wall, as Vince dodges it
He makes a phone gesture with his hand
'll call
Vince kisses two fingers, and blows the kiss to Christy
He leaves
Christy is left standing on the bed, holding a particularly garish stuffed animal she was about to hurl
With Vince gone she slumps to the bed, cradling the stuffed animal
She is caught between tears and rage
: - on various neon Vegas landmarks -- the Golden Nugget, Caesar's Palace, Bally's, etc
Scrunched in between two larger hotels and casinos is the The Moonlight isn't all that small, it's just seen better days
- spotlight hits a solitary figure on a small stage
The man is caped and dramatic, but not especially talented; an Elvis impersonator who's just a shade off in voice, looks and style
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
Are you lonesome tonight
Welcome to the Moonlight Hotel and Casino's incredible Platinum Oldies Spectacular
Backstage, there's still a look of resolve in Christy's eye as she waits to go on with  and , her back- up singers
But you can't quit
What'll happen to us
(to Tina) Tell her she can't quit
told her
She stuck pantyhose in my mouth
Onstage, Elvis glances into the wings to be sure the Ronelles are ready
Page 6
Please welcome our own girl group extraordinaire, our beehives of beauty -- the fabulous Ronelles
Elvis disappears
The spotlight hits Christy, who wears a high beehive wig and a sequinned, early Supremes-style gown
Michelle and Tina wear matching gowns and wigs
The band begins a doo-wop vamp
Oh, girls
Yes, Betty
This prom is a real drag
Oh-huh
Oh my
(gasping) What is it, Betty
Look at that
Get a gander
Oh my
(sighing) He's so dreamy
He's like
a Greek god
He's the cutest guy here
He's boss
He's fab
He's
Yes, Betty
(singing) '
D00-, -, D00-
,
As they sing, their moves and gestures are carefully choreographed in vintage girl group style
Page 7
lot of talent and hard work has clearly gone into the number
While Christy does her best, her singing voice is not on a par with those of the other Ronelles
The lounge itself is practically empty, except for a few drunken Shriners and a couple of college kids sits at a ringside table with his eyes locked on Christy
An easygoing charmer, Eddie gives her a wink, but she responds with an up-yours look and a turn to the other half of the room as the song continues
- small, cramped room with cracked plaster walls and a sputtering fan for ventilation
Christy has her own dressing table and mirror, and the Ronelles share a table a few feet away
Clothing and costumes hang on nails or are draped over chairs as the girls change into street wear
Screw this dump
It's a roach motel with sequins
Every guy  meet is either married, a cop, or a lush from Des Moines
But what about us
You taught us the act
The songs, all the moves
And where did it get me
'm stuck in this rathole
You're holding me back, just like Vince
should be headlining
pock-faced weasel of a man named  opens the door and leans into the room
What do you want
This is a private area
Get lost
You ain't got nothin'  ain't seen
Then stop trying to memorize it
Hit the road
Joey takes a step into the room and sets a box on the chair near Christy
From Vince
Page 8
His ashes
With love
Joey leaves
Michelle and Tina hover around the box, very excited
They pick it up, trying to tempt Christy
From Vince
With love
Michelle and Tina can't restrain themselves: they open the box
Inside is a rather gaudy fur coat
Michelle and Tina are impressed
It's a fur
It's new
It's a bribe
Five years of my goddamned life
So you earned it
Vince owns the casino
Cash in should throw this in his facet There's a  on the door, and Tina opens it
Lieutenant Eddie Mulcahy enters
Christy is not pleased
Oh, Jesus
What is going on here
(to heaven) Why me
Whose dog did  kill
Hi, Lieutenant
Hello, Eddie
Eddie picks up the coat
From Vince
What a guy
Doo-lang, doo- lang
At least he's not a cop
At least he can afford a decent gift
used to buy
you,
stuff
On your birthday
When we were seeing each other
Yeah, like what
Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out
Lottery tickets
travel iron
So  don't shop
'Cause you're always out, arresting people
Making trouble
don't know why  went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing
couldn't hold my head up,  used to tell people you were a security guard
Oh, yeah
Well, how do you think  felt
You were singing in bowling alleys back then
told people you were a hooker
Calm down, you two
It's always like this
Yeah, well, now, she goes out with a' better class of people
Vince Laflocca
He's a businessman
what
When are you qonna wake up
When are you gonna get off my case
Have you got a search warrant
What do you want -- cheap thrills
Information, baby
thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience
Think again
And get out of here
Page 10
'm going
My regards to Vince,   And the Mrs
Christy hurls a jar of cold cream at Eddie's head
He ducks, and the jar hits the door
Ladies
Eddie leaves
Christy is standing, absolutely furious
That's it
'm not taking it from him, and 'm not taking it from Vince
From now on, it's all about me
And if can't spend it, drink it, or sleep with it -- it's gone
Like Sister Immaculata used to say, "Life is short, and then you fry
"  So long, girls -- see you in church
Christy grabs the mink and heads out the door
'  - sits across the enormous mahogany desk from Vince
The young man's throat is dry; he's sweating bullets
The presence of Joey the weasel and , a brutal thug, increases Ernie's tension
Ernie Schmidt
How long you been with us, Ernie Schmidt
Three years, Mr
LaRocca
One behind the bar, two as croupier
Vince gestures to the lush office and its furnishings
Ernie, you know what's important to me
What counts
It's not all this
This is '-- what
Frosting
Loyalty
That's me, Ernie
That's home
Vince gestures to Joey, who takes out a revolver and points it at Ernie's head
You ain't been loyal, Ernie
What did you tell the cops
Ernie's eyes open wide with denial as the gun comes closer to his temple
Page 11
Holding the coat, Christy waits by the elevator
It arrives; she gets in
' The interrogation continues
didn't tell the cops anything swear
Joey
Joey slams Ernie on the side of the head with the gun
Christy steps out of the elevator and faces a maze of office cubicles with half-wall partitions
The floor is deserted and dark as she makes her way through the cubicles
' Vince is standing over Ernie, holding his head up by the hair
Who else, Ernie
Who else was in on it
(moaning) No one
(dropping Ernie's head in disgust) Why am  wasting my time
Beyond the cubicles, Christy strides down a lush corridor to an executive suite
She tries the knob, but finds the door locked
Pulling a key from her purse, she unlocks the door to the suite and enters a large outer office with a reception area and doors to several inner offices
She tosses the key onto the receptionist's desk
Won't need that anymore
Ta-ta
Crossing to Vince's office, Christy squares her shoulders and narrows her eyes with anger as she reaches for the doorknob
She pauses for a second, and then doubles her resolve
Page 12
' Do it
(to Joey) on the door to the office, which opens
Christy appears, with the mink coat in her arms
Stuff this up your
is heard, 0
Christy's eyes widen, and her jaw drops, at what she has just witnessed
on the office
Ernie is slumped in the chair, dead
Joey stands over him, holding the revolver
Joey, Willy and Vince stare at Christy
Babe
(icy calm) Christy tries to speak; she can't
Christy
Is there a problem
With the coat
Christy glances around the room; she doesn't move
She quickly sizes up the situation
She tries to appear matter-of-fact
unaffected by what she's just seen
No
it's fine
Yes
Thanks
lot
Is that why you came up here, Christy
To thank me
Sure
And to say you're sorry
About this afternoon
And the things you said
Forgotten
Completely
Do you understand
Forgotten
(catching the subtext) Right
Yeah
Forgotten
Page 13
Vince crosses the room, to Christy
He takes her hands in his, and kisses them
That's my girl
My girl in mink
Will you be home
Soon
Christy kisses Vince, quickly
Right
'll be
at the apartment
Call me
Thanks
Again
Christy reaches for the doorknob, without looking at the door
She fumbles a bit
She finds the door
Mink
Wow
Christy walks backwards, out the door
She turns; she is gone
Vince -- is she
okay
Maybe
(considering this) mean, won't she talk
She seemed kind of upset
She did
(making a decision) Bring her back
Now
For a talk
And if she runs
(icy) Take care of it
With guns drawn, Willy and Joey run after Christy
Christy, clearly terrified, is walking quickly away from Vince's office
She passes through a glass door which leads to the cubicle area
of the cubicle area, which resembles a darkened maze
Christy hears Joey approaching; she runs into the cubicle area
Christy
He only wants to talk to you
Page 14
on Christy, crouched behind a half-wall
She is clutching the coat
Christy
There is a stuffed toy, a "Garfield the Cat," attached to the wall near Christy, with suction cups
Christy tries to pull the cat's feet off the wall, very quietly
Christy
Christy finally just yanks the cat off the wall
She hurls it as high and as far as she can, to the opposite end of the room
on the flying stuffed cat
Joey sees the blur of the cat; he  it, and the cat explodes
Come on, Christy
There's no place to go
Christy steadies herself against a Xerox machine
She accidentally activates the machine, which lights up and starts
on Willy, as he hears the Xerox machine
He quickly moves toward the
Willy reaches the Xerox machine; the area is deserted
He starts moving quickly down the aisle    chair, the kind on casters, comes rolling out of one of the cubicle doorways; the chair hits Willy and he falls
Christy runs out of the cubicle; Willy is on the floor, struggling to get up
As Christy sprints away, Willy at her
He misses, but a glass partition
Christy runs for an open elevator, but it has been summoned from another floor and the doors are beginning to close
She runs even faster
whistles past her ear and hits the back wall of the elevator
She reaches for the doors a moment too late, and the elevator is gone
Christy scrambles to the door beside the elevator and runs into a stairwell as two more  bite pieces out of the door
Taking the stairs three at a time, Christy is flying, still clutching the mink
The thugs are gaining on her hits metal and  off several walls and steps
Page 15
At the next landing, Christy opens the door and ducks into a corridor
Exhausted but powered by adrenaline, Christy sprints past doors to the end of the hall, still with the mink
Joey appears from the stairwell just as Christy ducks into a supply room
Christy shoves a cleaning cart aside and wades through a pile of dirty linen
Joey opens the door just as Christy dives head first into the laundry chute
Christy, lying atop the mink, flies through the chute like a subway train through a tunnel
The chute spits Christy out like a bullet into a huge bin of dirty linen
Two workers glance around as they load large washing machines with laundry
Christy climbs out of the bin and dashes for a door
Working in a hotel, the workers have seen everything
Joey flies through the chute
Joey suddenly flies into the bin
He climbs out with his gun in sight
Which way
The workers point to the door, and Joey rushes across the room
One of the workers is now wearing the mink coat
- Joey comes out of the hotel and finds an empty street
He looks in every direction, but the nearby streets have swallowed Christy into safety for the moment
- The central offices of the Las Vegas Police Department
' Eddie's office is a glassed-in area set in the middle of the station's main floor
Page 16
Christy is huddled in a chair, surrounded by Eddie and two other detectives,  and
Right between the eyes
Down and out
The guy was gone
couldn't believe it
You couldn't believe it
Vince the Prince
never said he was an altar boy, okay
But he sent his goons after me
They tried to kill me
'm not kidding
Tough break
Whoa
What did you expect
Vince is as dirty as they come
We've been finding bodies around here for years
don't know anything about bodies mean, he didn't bring it home
He was good to me
sometimes
He was sweet
He took care of me
Who am  supposed to go out with
He owns a casino
He let me sing
He didn't do you a favor
Screw you
Come on, she'll sing great
When she sings for us
Sing -- like testify
Are you nuts just want you to protect me
You're cops
Busy cops
We don't have time to be bodyguards for anyone who comes in here with some cockamamie story
Mink coats and laundry chutes
Unless, of course, you're willing to testify
Page 17
What is this, some squeeze play
Can't you just protect me without any strings
The three detectives move in closer now and really apply the pressure
We could put you into our witness protection program
hiding place
new identity
But you'd have to agree to testify
The whole nine yards
And if  don't
Then-you run
You wait
You listen for the footsteps
Then one day they find you
They open a window
It's ten flights up
Ten flights down
Ten flights
You'd lose
You'd die
All over the sidewalk
And into the street
All right
get the picture
'll do it
'll testify
(to Tate) Get a stenographer
Page 18
Tate leaves
Christy looks to Eddie for a bargain now
Okay, here's what  want
know about this stuff
five-star hotel
With room service
Maybe Hawaii
Diamond Head
Yeah
And 'll need a new look
Like a disguise
Maybe Armani
No -- Calvin Klein
For sportswear
And a limo
And my hair -- up
It could work
Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune
Let me spell it out for you
You have to hide like you don't even exist
You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight
(confused) Okay -- no limo
No nothing
What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me
'm gonna put you in the last place on Earth that Vince would ever look for you
Eddie smiles
Christy doesn't like the sound of this at all a Page 19
- Jesus delivers the Sermon on the Mount in vibrant red, blue and green stained glass
An  plays a hymn -- badly
Notes are missed, skipped over and mutilated
to a procession of nuns who march into a chapel at the ancient St
Katherine's Convent
The organ isn't getting any better, and we see it is being played by , a seventy-year-old nun with arthritis and a hearing aid
Apparently the hearing aid is malfunctioning, because Sister Alma doesn't seem to realize how badly she's playing
As the last nun in the procession enters the chapel, she closes the door behind her
Across the lobby, the front door opens and Eddie enters with a very reluctant Christy
(to Eddie) hate you
totally hate you
Safest place in the world
You think Vince would look for you here
As Christy looks around the lobby, various religious artifacts loom at her; we see them from her terrified P0V
on a crucifix, casting an ominous shadow, a stack of hymnals, and a large, framed Sunday School-style portrait of St
Katherine
Christy shudders
Nuns, Eddie
There are nuns here
Everywhere
It's crawling with 'em
It's a convent
All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along
With nuns
With rulers
No way
'm gonna go back, work things out with Vince
Christy turns to head back to the entrance, but Eddie catches her arm
Vince has put out a contract on you hundred grand
You've seen him in action
Christy searches his eyes for a lie, but realizes he's telling the truth
But
but Vince loves me
How could he
mean, five years
Page 20
And one bullet
That's all it's gonna take
(suddenly scared) But Vince has contacts all over the place
This is San Francisco
They'll be looking for me
Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent
Nobody knows you're here but me
We're trying to get a quick court date
month, maybe two, tops
'll spring you as soon as  can
(panicking) can't stay here
'll crack up
Eddie, what am  gonna do
Pray
(smiling) From inside the chapel, the  begins to sing a hymn -- horribly
The voices don't blend, and individual notes are real migraine material
Christy looks aghast
Eddie urges her into a corridor, and she follows
' The office is bare and austere
sits at her desk with her hands folded
Like all the nuns at the convent, she wears the traditional full-length habit and wimple
Mother Superior is in total command of all she surveys, and she seldom raises her voice or her blood pressure as she rules
Control is her passion; within the walls of the convent, she has created a world she can trust because it's a world she controls
But Mother Superior is not in control at this particular moment ' stands before her with a majestic presence and some bad news
Absolutely not
am very sorry, but no
' We can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture
Page 21
But she's been exposed to the underside of life
She is the underside of life
' And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation
We're a small convent, Bishop
Surely there are
more appropriate shelters
' Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother
The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation
But, Bishop
' St
Katherine's is a Benedictine Order
You have taken a Vow of Hospitality
To all in need
lied
' know
(smiling) Mother Superior's jaw locks
She realizes she is stuck with the situation and will have to control it as best she can
There is a  at the door, and Eddie and Christy enter
' Welcome, Lieutenant
Everything is in order
Aces
Bishop -- maybe a cup of coffee, down at the corner
The thought of being left alone with Mother Superior panics Christy, like a child left in the principal's office
Hey, you're not leaving me alone
' (reassuringly) You're never alone in this house, my child
Eddie touches her gently on the arm
Page 22
One month, two tops
Behave yourself
Bishop
(a last-ditch attempt) ' (opening the door to leave) Lieutenant
: - Eddie and Bishop 0'Hara are leaving, by the convent's front door
As they exit, they hear the , singing horribly
They both wince at the sound, and then chuckle
' Christy is pacing, outraged at her new situation
convent
They put me in a convent
What's the problem
Wasn't there any more room in Hell
(very calm) What is your full name
Your Christian name
Mother Theresa
Gandhi
Don't you understand
This is all a mistake
'm the good guy
'm the witness
And 'm being punished
Your name
Christy
Christy Van Cartier
Enough joking
That's my real name
Currently 'm a singer
Sort of
Very well
Oh my God
This isn't happening, tell me this isn't happening
It's a nightmare, 'm back at St
Anne's
Page 23
St
Anne's
Parochial school
Akron
St
Android's
You were unhappy
was expelled
When  was fifteen
The reason
Beats me
What do you think
Smoking
Heavy petting, without a chaperone
Heavy petting, with the chaperone
And wearing a black bra, under my uniform
The demon bra
see
You see
You see
have to get out of here    have to make a phone call
Don't you get  it
'm in a convent
You're a nun
(very stern) Sit down
What
Mother Superior rises
She is an extremely imposing woman
Sit
Christy sits in a wooden chair across from Mother Superior
Miss Van Cartier
What
(belligerent) Your cigarette -- out
Christy inspects her cigarette
Page 24
(ruefully) It has come to pass
What
joined this convent some thirty years ago
At that time, the world knew some measure of peace
And hope
Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise
And, as the years have passed,  have watched that promise destroyed
Drugs
Gangs
(staring at Christy's outfit) Spandex
And
so  have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror
And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls
Are you talking about me
And all those like you
You mean black people
Absolutely not
mean the wicked
The heedless
And their Las Vegas concubines
(very suspicious) What's a concubine
Check your driver's license
Christy stands, facing off with Mother Superior
Fine
Got it
Look, the way  see it, 'm stuck here, right
mean, 'm here or 'm target practice
So here's the deal --  don't bug you, you don't bug me
'll catch up on some sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low
So just get me a key and show me to my room, and do not disturb
Capisce
(suspiciously gracious) Of course
But it's almost lunch
Page 25
Cool
Is there a menu
Or buffet
Before we do, you might like to freshen up
And you'll certainly want to change (sniffing her clothes, the same outfit she's had on since the night at Vince's office) Deal
small room, with a sewing machine, some bolts of fabric, and several wooden cabinets
There is a wooden screen in a corner, marking a changing area
Christy is behind the screen; we hear her, but do not see her,  Mother Superior stands beside the screen, catching the various items of clothing which Christy tosses to her
(
) How about a robe
One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket
"Guest of St
Katherine's" Would you like that
Mother Superior takes Christy's skirt and blouse, and tosses them down a chute marked "
" (
) You should hand-wash that blouse, and send somebody out for some things look good in reds, purples, hot pink -- and shoes
Five-inch heels
Fuck-me pumps
Oh, man -- sorry
'Scuse my mouth
Mother Superior carries Christy's lacy bra at the end of a ruler; it goes down the incinerator
Excused
Open the cabinet to your left
You will find appropriate attire
(
) Can do
group of nuns are praying, their heads bowed
They hear a muffled , from elsewhere in the convent
They look up, puzzled
Page 26
Christy is standing before a full-length mirror, staring at herself, in complete shock
She now wears a habit and wimple
Mother Superior is doing final adjustments on the wimple
(almost unable to speak) No
No
can't do this
Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all
While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun
Only  shall know who, and what, you truly are
You will not disrupt the convent
You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk
You will draw no attention to yourself in any way
(furious, in disbelief) But look at rites  Look at this
'm a nun
'm invisible
'm a penguin
As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence
(outraged) Mary Clarence
Like a guy
Like a dumb guy
- Mother Superior is striding down the hall
Christy is beside her, trying to get the hang of her new outfit
The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola
There are three vows that every nun must accept
The vow of poverty
(pulling out her pockets) No problem
The vow of obedience
Like to who
Page 27
And the vow of chastity
'm outta here
Christy starts to leave; Mother Superior grabs her by the wimple large, whitewashed gothic room, with oak beams and a crude iron chandelier
There is a long, central wooden table, with rough wooden benches
The convent's population is standing around the table in silence
There are about thirty nuns in all
Mother Superior moves to the head of the table, with Christy following her
She motions for Christy to stand at her right
Good afternoon, Sisters
apologize for my tardiness
would like you to welcome a new member of our order, Sister Mary Clarence
on   , the nun standing beside Christy
Sister Mary Robert is naive and mouse- like, but very sweet
She has only been at the convent a few years; she wears the simpler habit of a novice
She sneaks a look at Christy
Her eyes widen, and then she resumes staring at her hands
Mary Clarence comes to us from a somewhat more progressive convent
She is eager for a more disciplined life, and will make every effort to conform to our ways
Everyone sits, including Christy
, a nun seated at the middle of the table, waves her hand
Mary Patrick is extremely cheerful, a truly upbeat person
Yes, Mary Patrick
Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, 'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St
Katherine's
on Christy, looking thoroughly disgusted
Page 28
As part of our welcome, 've had a little thought, just for fun
Could we have our new friend offer today's blessing
on the nuns, watching Christy
(reluctantly) Very well
Mary Clarence, rise please
Christy stands up slowly, aghast
blessing
Like, for lunch
on Mary Patrick, beaming
She and the other nuns bow their heads
(trying to recall a blessing) For what we are about to receive
So far, so good
Mother Superior has one eye open
may the Lord
prepare us and
watch us and
walk through the valley and be our shepherd and
to the republic for which it stands
God bless us every one, hallowed be thy name
Hallelujah
Ave Maria
Boyardee
Amen
on the nuns, staring at Christy
Mother Superior rises, very quickly
Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence
what
Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence
Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard
Silence
No talking
All day
Until sundown
Page 29
(mouthing the words
without speaking aloud) Oh my God
Christy reaches for a piece of bread
And Mary Clarence
Christy looks up
As a new member of our order,  think you might also enjoy a ritual fast
(mouthing the words) what
fast
To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat
(mouthing) No food
(taking away Christy's plate) No food
Not until sundown
on Christy, clutching her fork, hungrily watching the other nuns eat
- Vince leaves the police station with his henchmen, Joey and Willy, and  , an attorney
Vince is steaming as they walk through the parking lot
They grilled me for six hours in there
And my hotshot lawyer -- where the hell were you
It takes time, Vince
Slow and steady
We've been through this before
Vince reaches his car
As Joey opens the door for him, another car drives by, and stops
Eddie is driving; he leans out the window
So long, Vince
See you soon
Page 30
Vince lurches toward Eddie; Larry restrains him
Eddie drives off, chuckling
He's so damn cocky
This is different
It's a bluff, Vince
You know so much
They've got Christy, and we've got to find her
Get her 8x10, from in front of the lounge
Fax it to every contact we got
Larry covers his ears with both hands
can't hear this
'm an attorney, Vince, and you're just an honest casino owner
Object of a witch hunt
Innocent victim
Keep the message vague, but let 'em know
The price has gone up
Christy Van Cartier -- a quarter of a million
Dead or nearby
Vince looks grim and vindictive, as he gets into the car
- The vegetable patch is located behind the convent, on a patch of land surrounded by high walls
Various sections have been partitioned with string and then furrowed
Several nuns are working in the patch, weeding and raking
They wear large, ungainly straw hats over their wimples
Christy has been given a hoe and a straw hat
She is hacking at the dirt, with great disinterest
She picks up a carrot from the vegetable patch; she looks around to see if anyone is watching
She starts to gnaw on the carrot
She becomes aware that someone is watching her
She looks up
Sister Mary Robert is watching Christy eat the carrot, breaking her fast
Christy drops the carrot on the ground, as if it burned her
Mary Robert resumes hoeing in the next furrow over
Christy stares at Mary Robert, narrowing her eyes
Christy looks around; all the other nuns are busy at their tasks
Christy decides that she will try and make Sister Mary  Robert talk
She picks up the carrot and tosses it at Mary Robert
Mary Robert jumps
She waggles a finger at Christy, scolding her
Mary Robert resumes hoeing
Page 31
Christy is now determined
She takes her hoe, and tiptoes nearer to Mary Robert
Very gently, she uses the handle of the floe to lift Mary Robert's skirt, and gooses her
Mary Robert vips, very loudly
All the other nuns turn and stare at Mary Robert, scolding her
Christy waggles her finger at Mary Robert, scolding her
Christy, giggling to herself, resumes hoeing
She sees Mother Superior, standing at the end of the furrow
Mother Superior looks extremely grim; she has not missed anything
- of the sun going down, ending the nuns' Vow of Silence
We hear Christy ,
- This hallway is marked by a series of heavy wooden doors with tiny, grilled windows
These are the cells where the nuns sleep
Nuns are entering their cells and closing their doors for the night
Mother Superior glides down the hall, followed by a dusty, bedraggled Christy
Christy is devouring a slice of brown bread
Is this all the food  get
Yes
Until breakfast
That's tomorrow
Don't you have any snacks
Machines
They stop by a door
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence
My what
Your cell
Your room
' The door swings open, and Mother Superior and Christy enter
The room is tiny, with bare plaster walls
There is a narrow wooden bed, with a thin muslin-covered mattress
There is a small nightstand and a wooden stool
Page 32
(looking around) You were right the first time
Is this like, solitary
The cooler
Where's the furniture
Our lives are simple
We have little need for material possessions
Right, sure thing
But what about, like, appliances
Like a little color portable
Boom box
Useless distractions
(sinking to the bed) It's like the Stone Age
The room time forgot
What about a phone
And whom would you call
Oh,  don't know
Satan
(not amused) Your cell is more than adequate
Right
So what do we do now
Ping- Pong
Row over to the monastery
It is nine p
m
Pleasant dreams
Wait
No
You're kidding
Lights out
At nine
My day's just starting
'm sure
If  were you,  would use this time, to think about my life
And its direction
Or lack thereof
(indignant) What's wrong with my life
From all 've heard, just about everything
Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead
() Page 33 (') If you're fooling anyone, it's only yourself
God has brought you here
Take the hint
Mother Superior leaves
After the door shuts, Christy stands and looks out the one small window in her cell
She leans her head against the wall
She is trying not to think about what Mother Superior has said
Still, the mess her life has become overwhelms her
She fights back tears
- The sun is just barely rising, as the convent  tolls
' Christy is fast asleep
There is a  at the door
(0
) Sister Mary Clarence
All the nuns are proceeding, in their simple robes and nightshirts, down the hallway
Christy's door opens; she is still in her nightshirt, and her hair is a mess
What
Mary Robert, in her nightshirt, stands outside
Come on, we're late
What
What time is it
It's after five
We have to bathe
(groaning) Five a
m
- Christy is standing on line in the hall, along with several other nuns; they are waiting to take showers
They carry soap and towels
Page 34
(sincerely) Isn't it a glorious morning
Good morning, Mary Clarence
sleep well
Right
Is this like your old convent
Which convent was that, Sister
Which convent
It was, um, the Little Sisters
of the Moonlight
In Vegas
Everybody used to come to Mass
Frank
Dean
Sammy
Right at ringside
Enough jabber
is a much older nun; she is very no-nonsense, a hard-liner
What
Progressive convents
Vanity
It sounds awful
It sounds just like this place
Like this place
like my old convent, in Vancouver
Out in the woods
It wasn't all modern, like here
No electricity
Cold water
Bare feet
Those were nuns
It was Hell on earth, but  loved it
This place is a Hilton
stone room that is very medieval-looking
One wall is divided into stalls by wooden partitions
In each stall is a nun, standing beneath a crude shower head that releases a thin stream of lukewarm water
We see only the nuns' heads and shoulders
Still sleepy, Christy leans against the wall of her stall, her eyes closed
Lost in thought, she begins singing softly to herself
Page 35
' ' (very softly) -, - Christy looks up from her reverie; she looks around
The other nuns are bathing, their eyes down
There is no sign of singing
Christy decides to try a test
' ' (still very softly) -, - , ' -, - ' The nuns giggle
Where did that come from
haven't heard that song in ages
The Ronettes
(very grouchy) Shirelles
You know that song
1961
'62
Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows
It's the last secular music we recall
No
-- ' -, Page 36
(cutting off the song) That's enough
We've got to get to chapel
Mary Lazarus leaves the bathing room, and the other nuns resume scrubbing themselves
Christy looks around
Anybody got conditioner
- Bishop 'Hara is leading the Sunday mass
He stands in the pulpit
The choir nuns stand in a fenced-in area to his left
The remaining nuns, including Christy and Mother Superior, sit in the first few pews
' We are a small congregation this morning
Too many mornings
Something has gone terribly wrong
Where is faith
Where is celebration
Where is everyone
Still, rather than regret the absence of our neighbors, let us rejoice in the fellowship of those present
Our choirmistress, Sister Mary Lazarus, has informed me that our choir, while always superior, has been toiling especially hard on this week's selection
Sister
Mary Lazarus raises her hand, and the choir begins singing
They sing a traditional hymn, "Let Thy Thoughts Be Guided
" As always, their singing is dreadful; they have no tempo or pitch, and the hymn becomes an off-key drone
As the hymn continues, the    the chapel
Aside from the nuns, it is almost empty; only a few elderly people are in attendance
sitting with the other nuns
She is clearly about to fall asleep
Then the choir hits a particularly horrendous note, and Christy jerks awake
She immediately tries to assume a pious expression, tilting her head and folding her hands in prayer; she looks like a somewhat demented Sunday School calendar
Detective Clarkson gets out of his car and hurries into the police station
Clarkson crosses the busy room to Eddie's glass-walled office
Along the way, he signals Detective Tate to follow him
Page 37
' Eddie looks up from his desk as the two detectives enter
There was a raid on a pawnshop in
this morning
The place was fencing stolen property
They found this
Clarkson gives Eddie a fax sheet, showing a publicity photograph of Christy
Jesus
Data-base hoods
It's a wonderful world
(reading the fax sheet) Beloved daughter missing
Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
Please find our adored angel, we miss her so
Dead or alive
Vince is getting desperate
Where is she, Eddie
Where'd you stash her
Where's who
You won't even tell us
wouldn't even tell the Pope
- plain whitewashed classroom, with battered student-style desks
group of about eight local   has gathered
The girls wear extremes of hair, makeup and clothing; they are bored and scruffy, clearly the local bad Girls
Sister Mary Patrick is leading the class, in her usual perky manner
Good afternoon, young ladies
And welcome to our Christian Youth Group
The Girls make grunting noises
Hi
hope we'll have some fun, and maybe learn a little something, too
Now, today's topic is something very up-to- date -- "Teenage Promiscuity
"  My
Now, can anyone tell me -- just what is promiscuity
on the Girls, exchanging glances and rolling their eyes
Page 38 Anyone
Yes
Mary Patrick points to a Girl in bicycle pants
a bustier and a leather baseball cap
Her name is Lawanda
Uh, it's like, you know, doin' it whole lot
Till your head falls off
(blushing) Well, yes
That is one way to put it
Mother Superior enters the classroom accompanied by Christy Sister Mary Patrick
Yes
need to see you, at once
Girls, please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a few moments
Mary Clarence
Yeah
Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence
She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return
Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage
Do not attempt discussion
Am  understood
got it
(to Mary Patrick) Come, Sister
Mother Superior and Mary Patrick leave the classroom
Christy now stands at the front of the room
She is visibly uncomfortable
So, hi there
'm
Sister Mary Clarence
And you're
young Christians
guess  should assign you this passage
What's good
What were you talking about
We were talking about the wild thing
Teen promiscuity
Page 39 (after a beat) Really
Yeah
Sister Mary Pat was discussing it
You know she thinks it's a sin
(trying to behave) Well
yes
Yes it is
(goading Christy) How come
Sister
(still trying to behave) Well
because it's in the Bible
"Thou shalt not
"  Thou shalt not
The Girls all laugh and make jeering noises
Excuse me -- just what are you all doing here
At Sunday School
'Cause we love it so damn much
And cause we gotta come here
Probation
Probation
Yeah
We all got caught
Shoplifting
Cuttin' school
Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade
So we gotta come here
So we'll be good, in the future
So we'll learn valuable lessons
And  learned mine
will be incredibly good,  will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again
Can  go now
(getting fed up) Yeah, you learned a whole lot,  can tell
Well, what would you know about it, anyway
What do any of you nunheads know about anything
About doin' the nasty, or gettin' high
Leave her alone, Lawanda, she's just some ol' nun
Don't pick on no nun, it's bad luck
Page 40
(fed up) Shut up
All the Girls look up, stunned by Christy's language
Okay, so maybe 'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something
You want to listen, for once in your little lives
You want to pay some attention
What about crack
You a user
said  was a nun, not an asshole
All the girls jeer at Charlene
Got you, Charlene
Dunked by the nun
(more sincerely) Well, what about the sex stuff
What if some dude is after you, and he's always saying stuff, commin' on sweet and mellow
Like, oh, baby, you know you'll love it
Oh, baby, if you loved me, you'd stay
And you listen to that
No, but
don't know
sometimes
Hey,  know, it's hard
But do what do
(puzzled) What you do
Just tell him,  do love you, but can't -- 'm a nun
The girls all laugh; they are really beginning to like Christy
Page 41
But, like what if you are doin' it
What about protection
Who's responsible
What about them things, you know, for the guy
Aren't they like, a mess to put on
Don't they kinda mess up the mood
Deal with it, sweet thing
It's important, nowadays
You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana
(0
) Mary Clarence
Mother Superior has returned, with Mary Patrick
Everyone has been so wrapped up in the discussion, that no one has noticed their entrance
(thinking on her feet) Because a banana is part of a balanced breakfast
And don't forget fiber
'  - Mother Superior is seated behind her desk; she is very angry
Christy sits across from her
balloon and a banana
Tell me, Mary Clarence, what were you thinking
Those girls were asking questions
They've got it rough
wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age
wish somebody would talk to me about it now
This is a convent, not a clinic
We offer moral guidance, not hardware
Have you been out in those streets
Do you know what those kids are up against
You should help them
We are nuns
We seek solutions through prayer
Page 42
Sometimes it's not enough
You are correct
Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation
Such as your own, for example
How do you feel about physical labor
It never solves anything
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27
He spoke unto a wastrel youth
He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment
" In English
How to put it
ah, Of course, Mary Clarence
"No pain, no gain
" Mother Superior smiles in a rather evil manner
'  - Vince is on the telephone in his office at the Moonlight Hotel and Casino
He clearly has a new mistress or two
(very seductive) Baby, you know  do
of course feel it too
'm blushing
can you hold
second telephone , and Willy answers it
Vince meanwhile has pushed a button on his phone and is involved in a second romantic call
Soon, you gorgeous thing
tell me
how lonely
It's that call you were expecting, Vince
Can you hold
Can you try
Willy passes the phone to Vince
t Page 43 Have you found out where Christy is yet
Hey, bozo, you re on my payroll
You want to try making it on a cop's salary
Find her, and find her now
Vince passes the phone back to Willy
Raise the ante to three hundred grand
Willy heads for the fax machine
Vince regains his composure, and picks up his own phone; he pushes a button
Sorry, baby
you are
Totally
Not a stitch
Yeah, 'm naked too
inside
This is a large, open room where the nuns create various gift items which the convent sells to support itself
Several nuns sit at a table, diligently hand-painting Christmas cards and making Christmas tree ornaments
On the other side of the room is a large, free-standing loom, which resembles a grand piano
The loom is wooden; a tapestry is half-completed
Mary Patrick is seated at the loom, which is a complicated mechanism
Christy stands beside her
The minute  saw you
said to myself, she's a weaver
Have you ever used a loom
Not in years
Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy
'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent
Why
To sell, of course
hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St
Katherine's
We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money
But don't you get money
From the Vatican
Page 44
Mary Clarence
Goose
We're completely self-supporting
Like all convents
Like yours
Oh, right
At my old place, we used to
wash cars
Groom dogs
So
nice loom
Isn't it lovely
Now 'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in
(as she deftly works the loom) You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed
Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed
Shuttle
beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed
Keep tension on the warp
Is that clear
(pretending to be fascinated) Just about
Show me again
You betcha
- on the wall hanging, which has progressed considerably
on Christy, leaning against the wall, thumbing through a magazine
on Mary Patrick, hard at work at the loom
Shuttle, beat, shed
And watch your heddles
love my heddles
Show me again
Mother Superior appears
Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing
Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother - Page 45
Really catching on
Good
Mary Patrick,  need you in the office
Mary Clarence, carry on
Mother Superior gestures to the loom
Christy sits at the loom, and waves as Mother Superior and Mary Patrick exit
Christy stares at the loom; a look of horror crosses her face
She has not been paying attention to Mary Patrick's instructions
She cracks her knuckles, as if she were about to play the piano
She grabs two parts of the loom, at random
She moves these parts
on the loom
As a result of Christy's movements, the loom collapses, piece by piece
The tapestry unravels, the many skeins of wool snap, and the mechanical apparatus disintegrates, until finally the entire loom shudders and falls to the floor, as Christy watches, aghast
Mother Superior is striding down the hall; she is livid
Christy trails behind her, trying to keep up
'm sorry, 'm not a weaver
Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined
Look, this isn't my kind of thing wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, or knit little sweaters
don't do that
'm a star
Mother Superior stops dead in her tracks; she turns and stares at Christy
Then she smiles, in a rather frightening manner
- )on her hands and knees
scrubbing the stone floor of a convent hallway
)crawling along between the pews in the chapel, oiling every inch of wood with a bottle of polish and a rag
)crawling along the convent roof, cleaning out gutters with a trowel
She discovers a dead rat in one of the gutters
Page 46 )sewing; she is repairing a hole in a habit
The Christy is sitting in a small stone room, surrounded by piles of torn habits, linen and other mending
' Christy is on the phone in the darkened office
She keeps checking the door, to make sure no one is listening
(into phone) Let me talk to Detective Eddie Mulcahy
It's an emergency
Real bad
' Mulcahy
Christy cups her hand around the phone and speaks quietly and frantically
between Christy and Eddie
Eddie, you've got to get me out of here
Not again
You can't keep calling
Somebody's going to catch on to where you are
But 'm going insane
All these people do is pray and work, work and pray don't get it -- when's the weekend
They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food
Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns
sleep in a cell, on a board, and  pray five times a days  Do you know what pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea
Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet
Get me outta her
Calm down
Look,  didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately
Like what
Keeping our witnesses alive
We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead
You son-of-a-bitch
Page 47 just need a few more weeks, But it's a nightmare
Mother Superior is out to get me
She hates my guts
She keeps thinking up new kinds of torture
In the distance, Christy hears the  practicing; they sound even worse than usual
(holding the phone out) Do you hear that
That choir
Eddie, in here, that's what they call music
Don't call again
It's not safe
'll be in touch
As the line goes dead, Mother Superior enters
Christy takes her dust rag and pretends to polish the receiver
She sings as she works
Still singing, Christy breezes out of the room
Mother Superior looks mystified
'  - Christy is lying flat out on her bed, in her habit, utterly exhausted by the week's hard labor
There is a meek  at her door
(without moving) Yeah
Sister Mary Robert enters, very shyly
She barely looks up
What
What does she want now
did the dishes
oiled the pews
dusted the hymnals
Two hundred hymnals
Why can't people share
(not speaking above a whisper) Page 48
What
brought you something
cigarette
An extra heel of bread
Please take it, you need your strength
You've been working so hard
Mary Robert holds out a rather rugged crust of brown bread
Christy takes it
Thanks
So which one are you
Sister Bruce
Sister Doug
(until almost whispering) Mary Robert
'm
Mary Robert
Right
Okay
Bob
Nice to know you
Mary Robert nods, and resumes looking at her hands
She doesn't 1eave, but she's still tongue-tied
Christy is at a loss
So, Bob, how long have you been in
St
's
Three years
Sister
Three years
rookie
novice
Yeah, like a learner's permit, right
When do you hit the big time
You know, when do you take the final vows
Mary Robert bursts into tears
Whoa
Bob
What's going on here
What'd  say
Page 49
(still sobbing) You have to help me Right, sure, but what's the problem
Are they keeping you a prisoner here
Do they drug you
Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents
We can call the Enquirer
No, you don't understand --  don't want to get out
want to get in
Excuse me
Oh
Mary Clarence, 'm so unworthy want to take my final vows,  would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me
She won't
Why not
She says  should wait
She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life
She says that 'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet
In a mature manner
She said that
Reverend Mother
Mary Robert nods, solemnly
Suddenly, from the streets outside the convent, we hear a   hot dance , and the  of laughter and carefree conversation
Well, then there's only one thing to do
What
Reverend Mother says you need experience, right, in life
In order to make a responsible decision
This is going to be very painful for me
You know how much  love this little room
This whole convent
Wait
Christy stands, and goes to the crucifix hanging on the wall
She speaks to the crucifix, and listens, as if Jesus is advising her
Page 50
(to Jesus) Must  do this thing, 0 Lord
Please help me
,
yes,  know
must put my selfish cares aside
must think of others
yes, she's here
(she gestures to Mary Robert) He says hi
yes,  understand
let thy will be done
Amen
You too
Christy turns to Mary Robert, having received a holy message
We must do this sacred thing, Mary Robert
(desperate) Of course
We must do it
It's the will of God
What is it
(shutting her eyes, for the full spiritual effect) We must
get you some experience
We must
leave this place
Are you sure
Another    from the street
Christy turns to the crucifix
She gets confirmation
(to Jesus) We hear you
The outer wall of the convent
door swings open, and Christy sticks her head out
She looks both ways, and steps outside
She beckons to Mary Robert, who appears from behind her
Mary Robert looks very wary
Christy pulls her along
Christy and Mary Robert walk along a street a few blocks from the convent
(looking around cautiously) Are you sure this is what Reverend Mother had in mind
Page 51
know it is
It's life
Experience
Take a deep breath
Christy breathes deep, and then lets out a whoop
She spins, letting her habit billow around her
(shocked) Mary Clarence
Now you
Mary Robert's eyes widen
She points to herself -- "Me
" Christy nods
Mary Robert lets out a tiny little whoop, and does a little, timid hop
It's a start
neighborhood hang-out, the windows bright with neon beer signs
The exterior is colorfully painted; the club all but explodes with good times
group of teenagers lounge on the steps, sipping beers and smoking
Among the teenagers are the girls from Christy's Christian Youth group
Christy and Mary Robert approach, and the group falls silent
How are you doing
(puzzled) Hey, Sisters
Are you going in there
You know it
We need experience
(remembering she's a nun) It's part of St
Katherine's new community outreach program
How old are you
You shouldn't be smoking
Have you ever seen a diseased lung
Hand 'em over
Lawanda reluctantly hands over her cigarettes
Christy turns to a   who's drinking beer
Page 52
And you, with the devil's brew passing through your lips
(holding out her hand) mind is a terrible thing to waste
The boy hands over the beer
Christy and Mary Robert enter the club
Christy enters the club and grins
She takes a drag on the cigarette
Mary Robert grabs the beer from Christy's hand, and takes a swig
(shocked) Bobs Experience
Right
Right
The club is alive with activity; the bar is crowded, couples are making out at small tables, and the dance floor is packed
The atmosphere is a combination of hazy darkness and colored lights; the club should have the feeling of a hot neighborhood party, with people of all ages and races
The  percolates, and Christy starts to move to it
She and Mary Robert find a table in the corner, and signal a nearby waitress
couple of bowls of chili
(holding up the beer) And another round of these
The waitress looks at the two women strangely; the club has never hosted nuns before
(to the waitress, confidentially) have to do this
So  can become a nun
(to the waitress) Initiation
You understand
Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head
Really
Page 53 (to the waitress) And she wants to be a nun
The waitress leaves, shaking her head
Christy and Mary Robert watch the action at the club
Across the room,  the bartender stares at the nuns, especially Christy; he tries to place her
Who are all these people
This is your neighborhood
Your turf
You should get to know 'em
From across the room, Mike the bartender continues to study Christy's face
He takes out a copy of Vince's fax photo and stares at it
He covers Christy's hair in the photo with his hands, creating a wimple
There is no question in his mind; the two are the same
Mike has a dangerous look in his eyes as he takes a gun from the drawer and slips it into his pocket beneath his apron
There is a   on a small stage at one end of the club
They start playing a hot dance number, and the club really begins to cook, as the dance floor fills
Christy and Mary Robert, both still seated, start to move with the music
very good-looking   comes over to the nuns table
He is clearly amused at their presence
Hey, Sisters -- how you doin'
(flirting) Better now
How come they let you out
Out of that convent place
Time off
For bad behavior
Oww
nun havin' fun
don't believe it
It's good to have you ladies in this fine establishment
So
anybody on the move
(standing up) am
Page 54
Bob
What're you doing
Mary Robert leads the Dude out onto the dance floor
'm getting experience
(to the Dude) You watch yourself
Christy decides she'd better keep an eye on Mary Robert; she grabs another , and heads for the dance floor
As the music percolates, Christy and Mary Robert dance; Christy is very hot, and Mary Robert picks up on her moves
The   are delighted, and cheer as the nuns start to get down
#1 Do it, Sisters
#2 Sway and pray
As the song, and the nuns' exuberant dancing, peak, the Club Patrons cheer, shouting "Hallelujah
" and "Amen
" - Christy and Mary Robert are walking back to the convent
They are both in very good spirits
Those people are wonderful
Why don't we ever see them in church
Good point
Especially that dude you were with
'd like to see him down front
(giggling) Mary Clarence
You're so
different from the other sisters
Sometimes, well
sometimes you sound more like a layperson
Honey
As the two women laugh together, they don't notice the car that begins to follow them, creeping slowly forward with its headlights out
Page 55
can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences
've learned so much
Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything
mean, nothing really happened
We just
took a walk
The car's bright lights suddenly switch on, and the nuns turn, startled
The car hurtles toward them
They scream, and Christy grabs Mary Robert and throws her out of the car's path; the two women land on a pile of garbage bags
Struggling to her feet, Christy sees the car go into reverse, and then pull forward again
She sees a glint of light reflect off a gun as the car's driver (Mike the bartender) leans out the window
(to Mary Robert) Run
Christy shoves Mary Robert towards an alley
As she does so, the gun   with a red flash
The shot misses the two women and  a plate glass window of the store behind them
Running up the alley, Christy and Mary Robert hear Mike's chasing them, growing louder as he gains on them
Mary Clarence
Keep moving
Christy grabs the ladder of a fire escape, and shoves Mary Robert up the ladder ahead of her
Climb
Now
As Christy and Mary Robert climb the fire escape, another in the alley, ricocheting off the fire escape
The nuns climb higher up the building
Mike pursues, looking for a shot between the steps and the landings, but not finding any openings
He takes the steps two at a time and begins to gain ground
At the fourth floor landing, Christy's heel gets stuck in the grating
She pulls frantically at the laces
Page 56
Goddamn it
Mary Clarence
Mike arrives at the landing just as Christy twists her toot out of the shoe, and surprises him with a lunge for the gun
Mike's hand is knocked back against the metal frame of the fire escape, and the gun flies loose, down the metal steps to the landing below
Christy shoves Mary Robert into the open window of an apartment, and follows her in
Christy and Mary Robert leap into the bedroom of an Hispanic couple, their arms wrapped around each other in bed
At the women's entrance, the couple looks up, stunned to see two nuns in their bedroom
Oh my Lord
(pushing Mary Robert forward) Experience
The couple continues to look stunned as the nuns race out of the room
- Christy and Mary Robert run up to the side door of the convent; they catch their breath
What was all that
Who was that man
Why would he shoot at us
don't know, some people just don't like nuns
wish  had a ruler
We could have been killed
But you saved me
(throwing her arms around Christy) Thank you, Mary Clarence
The door to the convent swings open
Mother Superior is waiting
Yes -- thank you so much
Page 57 - Christy sits alone outside Mother Superior's office, listening to the loud  of the clock on the wall
She seems small and vulnerable, like a child sent to the principal's office
The door opens and Eddie emerges from the office
What'd she say
You blew it -- big time
She doesn't want you back
Does she know people are trying to kill me out there
She's counting on it
She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you
Or a carnival
So what am  supposed to do in the meantime
Go in and talk to her
It can't hurt
(urging her) Go
Reluctantly, Christy rises and approaches the door
She looks at Eddie, who motions her to go in
She finally does
' Mother Superior is working on some papers at her desk as Christy enters
Christy is trying to figure out a strategy
So
hi there
(not amused and not looking up) don't believe we have anything to say to each other
Look
know  shouldn't have, 'm incredibly sorry about Mary Robert, wasn't thinking,  didn't know that would happen
Page 58
Mother Superior glances up from her work
She is justifiably outraged
Mary Robert's life was in danger
Your behavior was inexcusable
know
'm sorry    didn't mean for it to happen
And  was the one they were shooting at
Mary Clarence,  have given you every opportunity
To change
To make a decent life for yourself
decent life
Excuse me
As what janitor
Clearly, you have learned nothing
And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself
But you can't kick me out
Guys want to kill me
You're a nun
big nun
Aren't you supposed to have compassion
For the wayward sheep
mean, 'm a major sinner
All-time great
Hall of Fame
Aren't , like, your dream come true
Your Olympic event
Mother Superior stares at Christy
Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct
(surprised) am
You may stay
But  shall restrict your activities to but a single task
(with great dread) What
You have,  believe, some minimal background in music
Therefore, you are to join our choir
() Page 59 (') You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart
As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage
No
No
(smiling) You're my Olympic event
Not the choir, please, anything but that
The choir --  mean, have you heard them
'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that (in triumph) The choir, Mary Clarence
Go for the gold
- There are twelve nuns in the room, going over sheet music
Mary Lazarus is the group's leader; Mary Patrick and Mary Robert are also in the choir
Christy appears at the door, grimacing
Is this
choir practice
Sure is
Come on in, and sing a spell
Christy spots Mary Robert
Mary Robert,  am so sorry about last night
Now stop that
You didn't shoot at me
You were only trying to help, to give me experience
tried to explain that to Reverend Mother, but --  don't know if she understood
Mary Lazarus cuts off this chitchat, thrusting a hymnal at Christy
Soprano or alto
(very gloomy) Whatever
Page 60
Mary Lazarus hands Christy a hymnal, and raps her baton
The choir begins to sing; Christy doesn't even bother trying
She is horrified; the choir is the worst-sounding group in history
They seem to be singing in several random keys, and they even have trouble with the words
No one looks up from their hymnals
Sister Alma, the organist with the hearing aid, is plodding along
- Mike the bartender is taking chairs off tables and setting them on the floor as Joey and Willy enter
We're looking for Mike
You found him -- but we're not open yet
Willy grabs Mike's arms and bends them behind his back
Hey -- the till's empty
Willy slams Mike's face into the wall, stunning him
Joey lifts Mike's groggy face and offers sympathy
'm sorry --  don't know what gets into him
Who are you guys
We're the guys from Vegas
You had Christy last night, but you let her get away
It's upsetting
Willy hammers Mike's face into the wall again
But you didn't tell me
We didn't tell you what
That she's a nun
That chick you're looking for -- she's a nun
What
Christy
Page 61
nun
'm telling you
Willy and Joey look at each other, and consider this
Then they burst out laughing
They refuse to believe Mike's story
Gimme a hand here
Willy and Joey pick Mike up, and hurl him over the bar
Then they exit, still laughing
nun
- The choir continues its dreadful rendition of the hymn Let Thy Thoughts He Guided
Christy is not singing; she is clearly in pain
Mary Lazarus stops the song
One of the nuns has to nudge Sister Alma to stop her playing
Mary Clarence, are you with us
Um,  don't really know this one
Mary Clarence has a background in music
That's what Reverend Mother said
(eagerly) Really, Mary Clarence
Were you a choirmistress
Sure
Kind of
free-lance
(circling Christy) Free-lance
Oh really
You think don't see
You think  took vows yesterday
know what you're up to
You and Reverend Mother
What
You're a ringer
She brought you in to replace me
Out with the old
Page 62
Hold on
Mary Clarence, could you
Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but
(to Christy) Could you help us
Please
You've heard us
Well
Everyone falls silent
Mary Lazarus walks across the room, eyeballing each member of the choir
There's a word for this -- mutiny
(to Christy) So, Mary Clarence, you think you can do better
believe 'd like to see that
(she hands Christy her pitchpipe and baton) 'm out to pasture
Dry dock
The glue factory
Go ahead, Sister -- make 'em sing
Everyone watches Christy
Well
(to Nary Lazarus) With all due respect
let's have a look at this
Christy goes over to the piano
She examines the sheet music for "Let They Thoughts He Guided
"  She sits at the piano, beside Sister Alma
Christy picks out the hymn on the piano, accompanying herself
Christy's singing voice is, as usual, not very good
She stops singing
For perhaps the first time in her life, she has really heard herself
Man
sound like you guys
Page 63
(victorious) Very nice
Sisters, have we learned our lesson
won't hold this little episode against anyone
'll try not to
(standing) Mary Robert
Mary Robert jumps, startled by the attention
What
Mary Robert, 've watched you
You never really sing
You whisper
Nothing comes out
don't want to mess anyone up
(to Sister Alma) Give me a
(because Sister Alma is hard of hearing) Sister Alma plays the note
Christy points the baton at Mary Robert
Mary Robert whispers the note
Louder
Like you're onstage
Mary Robert sings a little louder
Like people are eating, and there's silverware, and you want them to hear you
Mary Robert sings louder still
Think about that guy you were dancing with
Mary Robert finally lets out her full voice, which is huge and glorious
After singing a single perfect note, she stops abruptly; she has scared herself
Oh my
Page 64
You see
We've got the voices
They're just allover the place
've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent
Better than me
We just need charts -- harmony -- chops
(puzzled) Chops
The goods
The sound
The sale
Let's rearrange a few things
Mary Patrick, you re not a natural soprano, you're an alto
Get over here
Mary Robert --with the sopranos
The two nuns trade places
Sister Alma -- a
Sister Alma plays the note, and the nuns try to duplicate it, but the results aren't much better than before
Christy uses her pitchpipe; she circulates among the nuns, giving each her note, urging them closer to pitch
Middle section, hold that note, for dear life
Sopranos, an
Sister Alma
Sister Alma hits the note
Christy shuffles a couple of more nuns to other sections, then gets a third note going with the altos, using her pitchpipe
For one moment, the nuns all realize they are singing a perfect chord
They are elated
We did it
We actually sang a chord
(thrilled and disconcerted) That was exciting
Yeah, for one second
That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other
Be a group
(under her breath) knew that
Mary Lazarus,  get the feeling that you like discipline
Hard work
Page 65
Of course
'm a nun
Four Popes now
The Lord hates a loafer
hear you
How many days a week do you rehearse
Two days
An hour or so
No way
We're a choir, right
Headliners
The big room
Two days a week won't cut it
Every day
(impressed) She's good
(to Christy) Do you really think we could do it
Get better
don't know
Mary Lazarus, what do you think
They're pretty raw
Wet behind the ears
bunch of real mama's girls
Oh, please
Can't we try
Christy and Mary Lazarus look at each other, as real comrades
Christy leans on Mary Lazarus' shoulder
It'll be hell
Tell me about it
Christy and Mary Lazarus shake hands, firmly
Christy turns to the choir, very businesslike
Ten-hut
- This is a basement utility room
large industrial washer-dryer stands along one wall; the machine makes a repetitive - sound Page 66
The choir nuns are busily doing laundry; some iron, others fold sheets, others stack towels and garments on a long table
Christy is helping Mary Patrick fold a sheet
Everyone is working rhythmically, to the drone of the washer-dryer
That machine
know
It's ancient
It's a rhythm section
The beat
Christy starts clapping her hands to the sound of the washer-dryer; gradually, the other nuns join her
Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups
The Dixie Cups
Oh my
was just a girl
Of course
(singing) (stopping the beat) Hold it
Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you
Am
There is a murmur from all the other nuns -- "Oh, yes
(as a confession) All right,  am,  know it
All my life, 've just been
upbeat
Optimistic
Perky
can't help it
Even when  was little,  remember my mother used to say, "That child is pure sunshine
She'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess
" So use it
When we sing hymns, they're usually about rejoicing, right
Celebration
Most music is
So don't hold back
Let all that joy go right into your voice
Make me happy
Let me hear it
Perk out
Perk down
Page 67
(with real joy) ' ' ' ' Because we're ' ' ' The nuns have really gotten into the song, with Christy encouraging them verbally
They are sounding better and better
, a member of the choir, steps into the laundry room and lets loose with a sudden, piercing whistle
The nuns immediately stop singing, and a moment later Mother Superior enters
The room is quiet except for the sound of the washer- dryer
The nuns all get very busy at their laundry tasks
(in unison) Good morning, Reverend Mother
Good morning, Sisters
Mother Superior takes one more glance around, then leaves
Now that the coast is clear, the singing begins again, quietly, to the rhythm of the machine
Bishop 'Hara is leading the Sunday Mass
' Welcome this Sunday morning, 0 ye few and faithful
Page 68
As usual, the chapel is almost empty, except for the nuns
The choir is in place behind the pulpit
' The choir,  am told, has elected a new director -- Sister Mary Clarence, who will lead them in Hymn 127
Christy nods to the Bishop, and signals to Sister Alma, who begins the accompaniment
They sound fantastic
Their voices blend with a heavenly harmony as they sing the slow, melodic hymn
Mother Superior is startled by this new sound
Lawanda and her friends glance at the convent with curiosity as the beautiful  drifts out to the street
few other heads turn, but with only mild reactions
At the end of the first verse, Christy signals the choir to stop
There's a hush in the chapel as Christy glances at the vacant pews
Then she turns to Sister Alma and nods
Sister Alma strikes a bold, stirring chord
Several of the nuns blink
Bishop 'Hara glances at the organ with surprise
Mother Superior sits up with a stiffened back and a severe expression
As the chord grows in force, Christy gives the choir a beat
One, two, three
The choir begins a radically new version of the same hymn
Christy strides up and down in front of the choir, transforming the song into a rousing gospel anthem, with a passionate call-and-response format
What you say
Page 69
But how
think  hear it
You know,  just might
Spontaneous reactions from everyone in the church
The gorgeous, exciting  pours into the street
Everyone turns to look
Windows open and people glance out
The street takes on a new movement
The choir really lets loose flow
Lawanda and her friends peer in at the back door of the chapel
Bishop 'Hara sees them, and beckons them to come in
Sister Alma
Sister Alma, inspired by Christy and the choir, burns up the organ with a solo
More people from the street begin to enter; tentative, curious, drawn by the music
At the end of the solo, Christy makes a gesture to the choir, and each member produces a tambourine
The chapel is full of energy, music and life
Mary Robert
Page 70
Mary Robert sings, really letting the power of her voice ring out
She is astonishingly good
The new visitors to the church begin to clap in rhythm to the music, and after a few beats, the nuns join in
Mother Superior is aghast
The choir builds to a huge gospel finish, all keeping their eyes on Christy
You know what we're saying
think they hear you
After the final note, everyone in the chapel is exhilarated -- everyone except Mother Superior
Christy looks out at the congregation that has increased by a dozen or more, including Lawanda and her friends
Christy looks happier than she has in years
- The members of the choir are all gathered outside Mother Superior's office, leaning close to the door and listening to her harangue Christy
They are surprised to find themselves joined suddenly by Bishop 'Hara, and part to let him through
He leans down to the keyhole and listens
Mother Superior is livid
Gospel
jazz solo on the organ
What next
Jesus goes to Rio
Good Friday-a- go-go
What were you thinking
Page 71
was thinking Las Vegas
Get some butts in those seats
And what next
Popcorn
Curtain calls
This is not a theater
or a casino
(sincerely) Exactly
People like going to theaters and casinos
But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that
Pack the joint
Through blasphemy
You have corrupted the entire choir
Hold on
That's not fair
worked hard with them
They gave up their free time, and they loved it
Those women are happy
And we can get even better
We can wake this place up
Out of the question
Please let me try
'm begging you
And  am refusing
As of tomorrow, Mary Lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir
Christy is crestfallen
There is a  on the door, and 'Hara enters
The other members of the choir are in behind him like sardines
' Reverend Mother,  just wanted to congratulate you
Oh
' haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years
What a marvelous program
Innovative
Inspiring
You are to be commended
Well
thank you
Page 72
' can't wait until next Sunday, when the choir performs again
Did you see the people walk right in from the street
That music, that heavenly music -- it called to them
Perhaps
' must tell the Cardinal
11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive
Really
Christy has just been eating this up with a spoon
Excuse me, Bishop
Reverend Mother has some other ideas too
She's too modest to talk about it, but she thinks we should get out of the convent and into the neighborhood more
(putting her hands on Mother Superior's shoulders) This woman
Mary Patrick jumps forward
Bless her
There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve
That's why many of us became nuns
It's marvelous, Reverend Mother
(confused by the turn things have taken) Really
(with regard to Mother Superior) You know Reverend Mother
Hides her light under a bushel
She has plans for us to move right onto the streets
Get to know people
Work with 'em
' (to Mother Superior) You're a pioneer
Page 73
But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood
' And you'll face that danger head-on
As if  could stop you
And you have my complete support in this matter
Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing
(hugging Mother Superior from behind) Don't you love her
- The nuns are out in force, painting the walls of the convent, mostly with rainbows and flowers and bright, shining suns
The   to Christy, who is adding her own original touch to the mural, using cans of spray paint
Christy's section includes an image of a nun in a miniskirt and spike heels, accompanied by neon letters that read "St
Kate
"  People gather in the street, watching the nuns' activities
The convent begins to crackle with energy and life
drug deal is going on in a house up the street, but the give only a curious glance to the action at the convent
' From the window of her office, Mother Superior watches the painters and feels her control slipping away
- Christy leads the members of the choir down the middle of the street
They get lots of attention each step of the way
As each nun raps, the other nuns make rhythmic boom- box noises
(rapping) ' , (rapping) ' , ' , ' (rapping) , , ' Page 74
(rapping) , , , ' The parade goes on, the crowd gathers, and a general air of jubilance prevails
- The rehearsal room is filled with high energy as the choir is separated into several groups
Christy has got the whole thing running like a disciplined Broadway cast
Mary Patrick leads one group in the corner as they practice synchronized movements with tambourines
Colorful streamers are tied to the tambourines, and they make colorful patterns in the air
Sister Alma pounds the piano with newfound energy, as Mary Robert and the sopranos reach higher and higher for notes they've only dreamed of in the past
Christy and Mary Lazarus have corralled the rest of the nuns into a practice of intricate dance steps, somewhat like the Temptations in skirts
Mary Lazarus keeps the beat with a yardstick
Don't look at your feet, and  don't want to see anybody counting
Make it look easy
Again
Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn
Hopeless Amateurs 2 Babies Again
- One of the drug dealers stands outside the crack house as a car suddenly pulls up to the curb
He starts toward the car as the  rolls down the window, but before he gets there, Christy and several nuns surround the car
Page 75
We're here to pray for you, brother
What
Get the hell out of here
We know you don't want to sell drugs
You just had an unhappy childhood, and maybe a learning disability
You just need someone to pray for you
We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors
We'll pray to find you some honest work
And we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity
We know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse
And so you truly need our prayers
What is this
Outta my way
The nuns give him room, and the Driver zips off down the street
small crowd has begun to gather, and it is growing by the moment, murmuring encouragement for the nuns
Christy turns to the Dealer, as other cars drive slowly past
Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers free  We're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house
(to the Dealer) We're nuns
(to cruising cars) Free prayers right over here
Drive up and get your prayers
You're hassling my customers
That's not legal
know my rights
This is restriction of trade
You wanna call a cop
Page 76
The Dealer's eyes turn ugly as he takes a gun from his pocket
Mary Patrick steps forward
Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy
Is it worth it
lot of witnesses here
(to the crowd) Can  get a witness
The Dealer glances at the surly crowd, then gives the nuns a disgusted look
He puts the gun away
So 'll find another neighborhood to do my business
You can' t stop me
If we can stop you here, they can stop you there
The Dealer turns and walks back to his house with anger
The crowd  and
The picture suddenly becomes , and we hear the voice of a

) It was a truly remarkable scene, as the nuns from St
Katherine's literally drove the crack dealers from the neighborhood, led by the feisty Sister Mary Clarence
and we see a  screen with an image of the nuns and neighbors still celebrating
On top of the are several framed photographs of Vince Laflocca, his wife and children
LaROCCA'   - LaROCCA, Vince's wife, watches the and calls to Vince in the kitchen
Vinnie, get in here
You gotta see this
Carrying a roast beef sandwich and a can of beer, Vince appears from the kitchen and glances at the  screen to see a shot of the convent
He looks at Connie and makes a sour face
Page 77
What
Nuns
You got me in here to see nuns
Isn't there a ball game on or something
Vince turns away from the  just as a closeup of Christy appears on the screen
Look -- she's adorable
Vince leaves the room, and we see Christy again as she leads the choir
'  - Eddie is cooking spaghetti in his efficiency apartment and watching the  on  at the same time
He pours himself a glass of wine and stirs the spaghetti sauce
This tiny convent has experienced an amazing turnaround
The sisters have revitalized and taken back their neighborhood, all due to the energy and talent of the convent choir, a group led by this gifted young nun
Tell us, Mary Clarence1 what makes you so special
(trying to appear modest and nun-like) Oh, 'm not special, Bob
It's just hard work
and prayer
Eddie all but spits out his wine
His eyes are wide as he watches Christy being interviewed
In one stride, he grabs his hat and coat and is out the door on the run
- The Sunday morning bell is  as crowds of people stream into the convent
The entire neighborhood looks cleaner, and the people walk with a spring in their step
Three local  stations have remote news crews on the scene doing follow-ups on the story
Last in line, Christy follows the other choir members down a hallway toward the chapel
Suddenly, a hand reaches out and grabs her, and a second hand covers her mouth as she is pulled into an empty cell
Shocked and terrified, Christy struggles to free herself, but is suddenly relieved to see that her abductor is Eddie
Page 78
Eddie releases her, and she falls onto the bed
Eddie
You scared the hell out of me
What if  was Vince
You'd be dead right now
What are you doing giving interviews on
It wasn't my fault
They just showed up
It's helping the convent
You're supposed to be hiding out
really can't talk about it now
The place is packed
've got a show to do
Listen to yourself
This isn't a career opportunity
know that
This isn't about me
It's about the choir
You should hear them
They're good
Really good
And taught them
Jesus, look at you   You're glowing
am
Yeah
You look
great
mean it
(flirting) Really
Lieutenant
've been worried about you
Eddie sits on the bed beside Christy
You mean -- worried about my testimony
No -- worried about you
Personally
Page 79
Well
thanks
've been thinking about you
- sometimes
mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here mean, sometimes  feel like
a nun
Me too
You're not
seeing anybody
No
Most of the time 'm thinking about you
And now
you've really changed
have
You re sort of
radiant
your eyes are shining
You're rea1ly different
Eddie and Christy are gazing into each other's eyes; they are just about to kiss
Their lips are less than an inch apart
You're
you're a nun
Eddie and Christy jump apart, their intimacy has frightened them both, particularly given Christy's outfit, and their location
We're in a convent
Christy goes to the door
've got to go
Just remember - you're a target
Don't you think Vince has a
(trying to think straight) know,  know
'll be careful
'll try
Christy begins to leave, and then she turns, filled with a performer's excitement
Magic time
Page 80
Christy hurries toward the chapel, leaving Eddie to shake his head and wonder
Sister Alma plays the organ, and the choir hums quietly as Christy addresses the congregation
Cameras from several stations are focussed on her from various places in the chapel
This Sunday's hymn is inspired by the lesson of Mary Magdalene
You know the one
Mary Magdalene was a young lady with a past
She was no stranger to sin
She was no stranger to practically everybody
Many condemned her
The whole neighborhood
But one man refused to do so
One man said, hey now, wait a minute
Listen to the story
Sister Alma starts playing a doo-wop vamp
Mary Patrick and Mary Robert step forward from the choir, standing beside Christy the way the Ronelles used to do
Hey, girls
Hail, Mary
Jerusalem is a real drag
Everybody hates me
Oh-huh
People throw stones
They call me names
mean, really
Really
But -- wait
What is it, Mary
That man -- who is he
He's a carpenter
Page 81 He's not like other guys
He's decent
He's kind
He's
dreamy
He's
Yes, Mary
'
The full choir sings back-up while Christy, Mary Patrick and Mary Robert perform intricate girl group choreography
- , -, -
/ / Sister Alma is surrounded by several   who play guitar, bass and drums to accompany the organ and choir
Lawanda and her friends sit in a pew, moving joyously to the music
Eddie stands in the back of the chapel, watching a Christy he has never seen before
Christy is now glowing with happiness and confidence
As the song continues, we see the chapel is packed to the rafters
tin bucket is passed around as a collection plate, and it overflows with money
Church services are over, and happy people stream out of the convent, but they don't hurry home
Standing in groups, they talk pleasantly and make plans for the day
There is a real sense of neighborhood up and down the block
Eddie comes down the steps, glances back at the convent, smiles to himself, then crosses the street to his car
Page 82
Christy and the choir stare at the collection plate that is filled with money
Jackpot
Two buckets This is so exhilarating
All week long, can't wait till Sunday, when we sing
'd rather sing than do anything
It's better than ice cream
It's better than springtime
It's better than sex
Everyone looks at Christy with astonishment
(catching herself) imagine
Everyone's attention suddenly turns to Bishop 'Hara as he approaches
' Better and better, Sisters, you are truly an inspiration
And  bear gladsome tidings
The choir gathers around 'Hara with curiosity
' 've kept the Cardinal informed of your progress in the neighborhood
He has been most impressed
And he has invited you to attend a special evening Mass at St
Matthew's Cathedral on Sunday night1 to sing for the Council of Cardinals
The choir reacts with an excited buzz:  "The Council of Cardinals
", "What shall we sing
", etc
Mother Superior appears, from the center aisle
That is indeed glorious news, Bishop
We will be honored to appear
() Page 83
(') And on such an occasion,  feel a completely traditional program will be best
What do you mean
The council of Cardinals is perhaps the most esteemed body in the entire Catholic church
They command the utmost respect
Your more
secular entertainment would be wholly out of place
But, Reverend Mother -- everyone loves our new style
It's brought people back to the church
Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals
believe this can be settled by a simple vote
vote
Of course
Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state
Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole
membership that,  am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner
All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program
All the nuns look at one another
Then, slowly, one by one, they all raise their hands
Mother Superior is pure steel at this moment; her expression betrays no emotion
Christy, on the other hand, is quite confused
But
wait a minute
The majority has spoken
Page 84
' Reverend Mother, as always, you are a true leader
Gracious and understanding
It will be wonderful, Reverend Mother
You'll see
(gesturing to Christy) She's a pro
What
am certain the presentation will be a great success
Congratulations, Mary Clarence
And congratulations to you all
The nuns cheer, and cluster around Christy, chattering about the upcoming concert, as Mother Superior strides off
'  - Seated at her desk, Mother Superior glances up as Christy enters
You sent for me
You have a phone call
Mother Superior continues with her paperwork as Christy picks up the phone
Hello
' Good news, kid
pulled a few strings the judge has agreed to move the trial up
We'll be in court in a couple of days
With mixed emotions, Christy speaks softly
That soon
Mother Superior is a very interested eavesdropper
' Forty-eight hours -- and you'll be a free woman
Page 85
Great
That's good to hear
' Hey, don't thank me or anything
Right, right -- thanks
Christy hangs up the phone
She looks at Mother Superior
Hey -- your prayers have been answered
'm leaving
In just a couple of days
Really
Well, that makes two of us
What
have submitted my resignation to Bishop 'Hara
Privately
have asked to be relocated as soon as possible
But -- why
must go where  can be of use
But -- there's so much more to do right here
And look, if it's about me, mean, 'm gone
Indeed
After how long
few weeks
have been here thirty years
And yet, it would seem,  know nothing
But everything that's happening is good
You can be a part of it
part of what
Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday
You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them
They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party
() Page 86
(') You and  know that life is not so simple
There will be disappointments
Rude shocks
And you will have vanished
How
fortunate
Okay, so  just got things started
But you could build on that
You could keep it going
am sorry, Mary Clarence
seem to have misplaced my tambourine
Good day, Mary Clarence
But
Good day
Christy, frustrated, leaves the room
Mother Superior looks up, she is truly torn, a proud woman unsure of her choices
- The moon casts shafts of silver light down to the courtyard of the convent
Most of the lights in the neighborhood are out at this late hour
' (whispering) Come on
've got a surprise
- The kitchen is dark, lit only by a flickering candle carried by Christy
Three more candles appear, carried by Mary Robert, Mary Patrick and Mary Lazarus
The door to the freezer opens, and light spills out
Christy removes several pints of ice cream and distributes them to the nuns
(delighted) Ice cream
Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have
Where did you get this
It's a sin
It's a wicked indulgence
Is this butter almond
Page 87
Christy and the nuns sit on stools, enjoying their ice cream by candlelight
It's contraband
Don't ask
But wanted to give you a treat
sort of
thank-you gift
thank-you
For what
You're the one we should be thanking
Is there any syrup
Well
see, at my old convent,  wasn't always
real popular
was sort of selfish and
not real helpful
Okay, 'll say it --  wasn't much of a nun
But now, thanks to all of you
maybe 'm shaping up
Mary Clarence, don't be silly
You're an example to us all
You've taught us so much
We're singing for the Cardinals, and then -- who knows
Maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes
Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us
We could cut a demo
Look for a label
(knowing she has to leave) That's true, wouldn't that be great
Of course, we never know when things are going to change
Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow
(worried) Are you leaving us
(sincerely) Oh no
We'll always be together
That's what Diana Ross said
Page 88
Christy and the nuns qiggle, and continue eating their ice cream, in a spirit of true friendship
Mother Superior watches this scene, hidden in the shadows by the door to the kitchen
She has begun to see Christy in a new light
She looks thoughtful, and walks off
- Tate sits at his desk in the detective room, reading the sports section
, the accountant for the police department, looks stressful as he enters the room and heads for Eddie's glassed-in office
Tate glances up as Parker passes his desk
You're too late
Mulcahy just left
need his signature on some things
They can't be processed without it
Leave 'em
He'll sign 'em later
Parker looks annoyed -- he doesn't like deviations from procedure -- but after a moment of indecision, he sets the file folder on Tate's desk and walks away
Tate finishes the newspaper and shoves it aside
Bored, looks at his watch, then flips the file folder open and glances at its contents;  routine money vouchers for equipment, supplies, etc
Tate is about to close the folder and shove it aside when something catches his eye
What the hell is this
He examines a money voucher for a generous donation to St
Katherine's Convent in San Francisco
It only takes a moment to put two and two together, and Tate scrambles for his phone and dials a number
Henry Parker waits for the elevator
When it opens, he's surprised to see Eddie step out
Tate said you were gone
get all the way down to my car, and, of course -- where are the keys
Page 89
left the money vouchers with him
He said you'd sign them in the morning
Eddie nods and moves on as Parker enters the elevator
After a few steps, Eddie suddenly looks disturbed
He picks up his pace
little panicky, he begins to jog toward the squad room
' Vince is on the telephone
He signals Joey and Willy, and they move quickly toward him
This is it
Get ready to move
No mistakes
Grab her, get her to the Moonlight
We meet there, and we take care of her
(into phone) We're on it
Give me the address
Vince begins to write down the address
Tate is hunched over the telephone, talking quietly with his back to the rest of the room
The voucher for St
Katherine's is in his hand as Eddie moves quickly toward him
St
Katherine's Convent on East Barton
It's gotta be the place
Tate hangs up the phone and
Eddie hits him from behind like a linebacker, drilling him to the floor
Other detectives look up from their desks with confusion and alarm
Eddie pins Tate to the wall and snatches the voucher from his hand
You're the leak, you son-of-a-bitch
Clarkson and another detective restrain Eddie before he can hit Tate
Get him out of here
Downstairs, in the cell
want his ass locked up now
Nobody dares even question Eddie at this moment, and two detectives drag Tate away
Eddie grabs Tate's phone and dials long distance
Clarkson, get on the other line
Call Frisco Central
Tell 'em to get two squad cars outside St
Katherine's convent, and stop anybody with an out-of- state license plate from getting near the place
Clarkson dials quickly
Eddie listens to Tate's telephone as it  and  and
- All the nuns are in the chapel as the choir rehearses a hymn, along with Gina and her girlfriends
Those who are not in the choir clap their hands in rhythm
War in the background, we can hear the telephone
- Eddie's police car streaks past an entrance ramp with the screaming
It blazes through traffic, weaving in and out at breakneck speeds
moment later, Joey and Willy pull onto the highway at a fast rate
The race is on, with Eddie securely in the lead
- In the rehearsal room, the choir members are putting on their robes
Christy and several nuns are all trying to primp in front of one small mirror
The Council of Cardinals
'm so nervous
What if  forget the words
Right to Hell
Just kidding
Where is that bus
It should be here any minute
(with a clipboard) Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30
Sharp
Christy looks out the window, but sees no bus
- Eddie's police car streaks toward
Page 91
- The neighborhood has turned out to see the choir off
Banners hang from the fire escapes of the building across the street:  "
' -
", " " Catholic school bus pulls up to the convent and parks in front
Several nuns in choir robes come outside and hurry onto the bus
moment later, Eddie's police car streaks up to the side entrance of the convent, parking around the corner from the bus
Eddie runs into the convent and finds Mother Superior at the bottom of the stairs
Reverend Mother
Quick
Where's Christy
What's wrong
They know she's here
They're on their way
Mother Superior points up the stairs
The rehearsal room
Mother Superior looks alarmed as Eddie takes the stairs two at a time
Looking out the window, Mary Robert sees the bus
It's here
Let's go
Everyone makes a final check of their appearance, and then the group leaves the room to head for the bus
Mary Robert and Mary Patrick are the last to leave, except for Christy
Hurry, Sister
Get moving
'm right behind you
Christy primps in the mirror one last time, then leaves the room
She is puzzled to suddenly see Eddie running toward her from a side staircase
Page 92
Eddie
Eddie grabs her hand and pulls her toward the side staircase
Vince knows you're here
(shocked and scared) How
Long story
His goons will be here any minute
We've got to get you out of here '- now
Christy and Eddie hurry down the steps to the side entrance, and she almost trips on her choral robes
Eddie opens the door and starts outside, but Christy stops in her tracks
can't go with you
What
've got a show -- at St
Matthew's Cathedral
We're singing for the Cardinals
You're gonna be singing for St
Peter if you don't get your ass out of here
Eddie jerks her hand, and Christy follows him reluctantly to the car
' Eddie takes off at a fast clip up the street
As the car cruises through an intersection, Christy looks back at the bus with confusion and sadness
She sees the other nuns rushing back into the convent to look for her
Several members of the choir rush into the room with panic in their eyes
Mary Clarence
Sister
It's no use
She just isn't here
Page 93
It doesn't make any sense
She was right behind me
The  on the school bus blows loudly down in the street
We can't sing without her
What should we do
(calming herself) We'll pray -- and she'll be there
The nuns are calmed by the tone of Mary Patrick's voice
They leave the room to join the others on the bus
- Eddie's police car streaks through crowded streets
' Christy still looks unsettled
Eddie -- 've got to go back
They won't sing without me
'm deserting them
think they'd understand
That's not the point
They need me
Eddie glances at her, impressed by the influence the convent has had
They need you
bunch of nuns
For what
Moral guidance
Make-up tips
You don't get it
It's a big thing for them, it's like
Caesar's Palace
Prime-time
They're singing for the Cardinals
It's like
"Star Search
" If first prize was a trip to the Vatican
They've worked really hard, they deserve this
(goading her) Nuns
Page 94
They're not nuns
They're like
people
With one outfit
- Joey and Willy park their car in front of the convent, get out quickly and climb the steps to the front door
They ring the bell
So that guy in the bar was right
She's like
some kind of nun
Yeah, right -- when  see it
Lawanda and her friends watch Joey and Willy pounding on the convent door
You dudes looking for nuns
They all went to St
Matthew's
St, Matthew's
Thanks
Praise the Lord
Joey and Willy run past the girls, get into their car and take off
'  - Eddie glances at the dashboard and sees that the fuel gauge is close to empty
He wheels into a gas station and pulls up to the tanks
Christy starts to open the door, but he stops her
What're you doing
Even nuns have to pee
He lets her go, then gets out to pump gas
' Christy enters the bathroom; it is deserted
She fondles her rosary beads, and sinks to her knees
This position doesn't work for her; she stands
She looks around her; she glances up, toward heaven
She decides to do things simply, and speaks in a matter-of-fact tone
Page 95
Okay, it's me
Mary Clarence
Christy
It's Chris Carter
need some help here
can't believe 'm doing this
Okay, look,  know  should just get back in the car, and get the hell out of here
Save my skin
mean, it's not wrong, Vince really wants to kill me
Why do you make guys like Vince
But if  don't sing at St
Matthew's
Mary Robert
Mary Patrick
It means so much to them
They're counting on me -- and  like that
Maybe Reverend Mother is right, maybe  am a bad influence, maybe 'm just some Vegas slut, but
can we cut a deal here
mean,  still don't believe in, like, most of the Commandments, and stuff in church still gives me the willies, but -- if  go back and sing, if do a good deed, will you promise won't get killed
All  want is a sign
Lightning
Thunder
Anything
Suddenly, Christy hears the toilet  in the next bathroom
(in disbelief) No
No
Doesn't count
Suddenly, Christy hears " " coming from a radio or outside the bathroom
She looks up; a ray of sunlight illuminates a grimy, dime-store Christmas tree ornament hanging from a room deodorizer
The ornament is a glittery angel; it sparkles in the light
Christy leaves the bathroom, still not quite sure
Christy looks through the grimy window of the gas station office
bored Mechanic is watching a small portable
On the  is an episode of "  ":  Sally Field, in full habit, is soaring along
Suddenly, Christy hears the loud  of a motorcycle starting up over by one of the gas pumps
The  turns and looks at Christy:  he has long hair, and a beard and moustache, and he looks, well, a bit like Jesus
Oh my God
Christy runs up to the Biker
'm late for church
Can  get a lift
Page 96
Christy swings onto the back seat; the Biker puts his Harley in gear and flies down the street
Eddie is shocked as he drops some money on the ground and jumps into his car to follow
'  - We see a network truck parked in front of the landmark cathedral
There is a sense of chaos in the chapel as  set up television equipment, and Mother Superior leads the choir as it rehearses
Near the back of the chapel, Bishop 'Hara looks concerned over the performance of the choir walks up to Bishop 'Hara
Is this the choir you've been speaking so highly of, Bishop
' They're just a bit nervous
They'll be fine
The choir seems very demoralized as they finish the hymn
Mary Patrick is close to tears
We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence
We're losing it
don't understand
Where is she
Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her
Pull yourselves together
Clapping his hands briskly, the   suddenly steps forward from behind the  cameras and hustles the choir away from the altar
Okay, Sisters, we have to move on now
That was great, just great
Charlie, throw a spot on the pulpit
Let's get a balance
Dispirited, the choir leaves the altar and walks toward the back of the church
Page 97
The motorcycle flies through the streets, breaking every traffic law on the books
Christy's robe flaps behind her in the wind, and she has a wide smile as she rides
As passersby stare at her, she holds out two fingers and blesses them
' Mary Robert stands alone in front of the cathedral, wringing her hands with worry
Suddenly, her face brightens like the dawn as she sees Christy ride up
You're here
Thank goodness
Christy and Mary Robert rush down a side corridor, turn a corner and see two  Technicians standing near some cables with the letters of the network embroidered on the backs of their jackets
Christy rushes up to them and taps them on the shoulders
Excuse me -- where's the rehearsal room
The two Technicians turn toward her, and she is horrified to see they are
Joey and Willy
Christy gasps as Willy sticks a gun in her ribs
Joey smiles at her
The rehearsal room is right this way
Joey opens a door that leads to an alley behind the cathedral
Mary Robert looks confused
Wait, this isn't the way
Who are you
They're from my old convent
Christy suddenly lifts her knee into Willy's groin, and he buckles over
She scrambles for the gun, but Joey beats her to it
Christy looks frantically at Mary Robert
Run
Take off
Again
Revived Willy lunges for Mary Robert and grabs her
The two men hustle the two struggling nuns out the door to the alley
Page 98
- Joey and Willy wrestle the two nuns to the open door of their car
They shove Christy and Mary Robert into the back seat, and Willy climbs in next to them
Go
Joey starts the car, and it takes off with tires
Willy has his gun pointed at Christy, who sits beside Mary Robert
But what do they want
Where are we going
(to Joey and Willy) She's got nothing to do with this
Let her go
Yeah, right to the cops
No way
Mary Robert, don't panic
Remember what we talked about
Experience
What
(quickly, to Mary Robert) You can handle this
The car comes to a stop at an intersection
Christy reaches across Mary Robert and opens the car door
She shoves Mary Robert into the street
Go
Mary Robert executes a perfect somersault onto the sidewalk
She looks to heaven, crosses herself and runs back to the cathedral
Willy grabs Christy before she can escape
She's gettin' away
Forget her
We got the one we need
Step on it
Joey takes off again
Page 99
Eddie's car is tied up in traffic, but he turns on his blinker lights and peels over to the opposite lane
Cars stop to let him through
'  - In the rehearsal room, Mary Robert has just finished telling the nuns what happened to Christy
You mean -- they kidnapped her
Yes -- two men -- and they had guns
She shouldn't have come back
She knew she was in danger
But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun
Were they Catholics
Mother Superior suddenly steps forward
She isn't a nun
Her real name is Christy Van Cartier, and she is a professional entertainer
She witnessed a vicious crime, and has been hiding in our convent
The nuns all react with shock and emotion
An
entertainer
She wasn't a nun
She lied to us
But
but
she was such a wonderful nun
Look what she did with the choir
She made us sing beautifully
That should have tipped us
Page 100
Well,  don't care who she is
We can't sing without her
She's our inspiration
She's the act
Reverend Mother,  know that you and Mary Clarence didn't always agree, but -- we've got to help her
We've got to save her
We can't leave it up to the Feds
The nuns all look to Mother Superior for an answer
Calm down
Think clearly
Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were
She said they were from her old convent
But
she was a showgirl
She didn't have an old convent
She told us about one
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight
In Las Vegas
All right
It's a beginning
Las Vegas, Nevada
All the nuns hurriedly cross themselves
Mary Lazarus, find the Bishop and tell him the situation
Everyone else -- follow me
Mother Superior leads the way out the door
- The Driver sits at the wheel of the school bus, reading a sleazy novel
He looks up as the nuns all converge on the door
Page 101 Emergency
Open up
The Driver opens the door
The San Francisco airport
Immediately
The nuns are all zooming past the Driver, onto the bus
(to the Driver) Step on it
Mary Lazarus grabs the Driver's sleazy novel, confiscating it
The Driver starts the engine
As the bus drives off, Eddie's car streaks    and parks in front of the cathedral
' Eddie rushes into the lobby and sees Bishop 'Hara
Where is she
' There was a kidnapping
We think Las Vegas
Eddie turns and races back toward the car
- Several small planes are parked on the tarmac
Mother Superior and the nuns are arguing with the of the airport, a grouchy guy in grease-stained overalls
Fifteen hundred for the run to Vegas
Rock-bottom
But we don't have fifteen hundred
We're nuns
The Manager starts back toward his office
Can't help you
No exceptions
Young man
Page 102
The voice has a powerful ring of authority to it, and the Manager looks around
What
We are nuns
We pray
So
We pray for good things
Food for the hungry
Peace on Earth
However, we can also pray for other things
Measles
Lawsuits
Tax audits
There is a pause, as the Manager stares at the nuns in horror
Come, Sisters
Let's go to chapel
Bring your beads
The nuns begin to leave
Wait
- plane sweeps through the desert sky, headed for Las Vegas
Through the windows of the plane, we see nuns staring out at the glittering city in the distance
- Packed with gamblers, the room is a flurry of activity
Joey works his way through the crowd, then spots Vince near the money cage
We got her
Page 103
Vince follows Joey out of the casino with a grim expression
Vince and Joey enter a storage room that is cluttered with boxes
Christy is tied to a chair in the back of the room, with Willy standing guard over her
Christy sits very calmly, despite the anger she is in
She seems distinctly nun-like in her radiant serenity
(turning on the charm) Babe
Christy does not reply
Babe, what happened here
Look at you
Good evening, Vincent
What, Vincent
This is me, doll know you
What did you think you were doing
Running to the cops
Hiding out
No, no
You're sorry now, aren't you
am sorry for all my sins
And yours
Vince, Willy and Joey all look at each other, perplexed
She's a nun, Vince
(kneeling by Christy) love you, Chris
always will gave you so much
My time
My affection
big-time career
And how do you repay me
What's the thanks get
Where's the loyalty, huh
Where's the love
You will be judged, Vincent
We all will
Vince stands; the charm hasn't worked
He's getting angry
What do you mean -- judged
don't get judged, baby
() Page 104
(') And who are you to talk
You were nothing
You couldn't even sing
must have been out of my mind
She's acting weird, Vince
Ever since we picked her up
It's spooky
It's like she ain't even afraid or nothing
Vince grabs the front of Christy's habit and squeezes it tightly around her throat
She's afraid
Come on, tell the boys you're afraid
(calmly) feel sorry for you, Vincent
And forgive you
This really throws Vince, and angers him further
He glares at Christy, and then releases her
He turns to Joey and Willy
Who gives a damn
Waste her
Joey and Willy look a little unsure as Vince storms out of the room
The nuns are mesmerized by the bright skyline with its colorful flashes of neon
It's so beautiful
And what a lovely name
Las Vegas
And Gommorah
The plane sets down at the Vegas airport
Mother Superior and the nuns climb out
Joey and Willy find Vince near the bar
Page 105
It's done
Not
totally
(disturbed) What's the problem
She's
she's a nun
Are you nuts
She's not a nun
It's Christy
She's a babe
But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent
It didn't happen
She was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car
No smart-ass remarks or nothing
can't believe this
Okay,  want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time
Yeah
Right
That way we'd never know which bullet got to her brain and killed her first
It could always be the other guy
They all look happy with this solution as Joey and Willy leave
Christy still shows no signs of fear as Joey and Willy take out their guns
Okay, we got one-two-three, and on three we both shoot
Got it
Page 106
Got it
Joey points his gun at Christy's left temple, and Willy points his gun at her right temple
One
two
Christy closes her eyes
Three
Neither man shoots
They look at each other with anger
Christy opens her eyes
You didn't shoot
Neither did you
figured if you were gonna, then wouldn't have to
That's what  figured, too
The nuns leave the terminal and stand on the sidewalk out front
Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere
But where
Look
There she is
Mary Patrick is pointing to a group of billboards that feature huge ads for the local hotels and casinos
The center billboard has a splashy picture of a roulette wheel, the Elvis impersonator, and Christy and the Ronelles
The bottom part of the billboard shows the name of the Moonlight Casino and Lounge
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight
But how do we get there
Page 107
Stand back
(she strides into the road) Taxi
Once again, Joey and Willy find Vince
Well
It didn't work, Vince
You were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot
We both missed
Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right
Right
So, take it off
(shocked) Strip down a nun
You want us to fry
For like, twelve zillion eternities
'm telling you, she's not a nun
Get her out of the nun outfit, and put her in some clothes
Maybe pants
sweater
And then we can ice her
No nun, no evil eye
Joey and Willy are very confident about this solution
They strut off, pleased with themselves
Page 108
- Eddie strides out of the airport; he took a later flight than the nuns
squad car is waiting; Clarkson beckons him
Lieutenant
Eddie jumps in the car
Clarkson turns on the red bubble light and the , and the car zooms off
- Joey and Willy return to the storage room, looking confident of their mission this time
Christy glances up at them as they enter, and Willy begins to untie her
We got it all worked out
He works the ropes free, and Christy rubs her wrists to get circulation back again
Okay, Christy -- strip
What
That
thing
That nun thing
Take it off
Christy suddenly drops to her knees and begins to pray
What's she doing
She's praying
And God bless Joey and Willy, who are only trying to do their jobs
(faking Latin) Pox fibula tibia vobiscum
Et marcus domino's pizza
Have mercy
Amen
(she looks up at the guys) 'm finished now
Help me up
As Joey and Willy bend down to help her up, Christy suddenly grabs their neckties in each hand
With a fierce jerk, she pulls the neckties with all her might, smashing Joey's head against Willy's
Page 109
Stunned, Joey and Willy stagger backward, holding their heads
Christy scrambles out the door while the two men groan in pain
Joey and Willy burst out of the room with guns drawn
At the far end of the corridor, they spot a glimpse of black clothing as Christy starts down the stairs
There she goes
she's taking the stairs They run quickly after her
Christy runs down the stairs as a  rings out
Christy screams and runs even faster
door swings open into the casino, and Christy appears, looking frantic
is heard behind her, and she sprints into the casino
Seconds later, Joey and Willy appear
Find Vince and tell him what happened
'll take this side of the room
Willy hurries away to find Vince, and Joey starts searching the crowd
Three cabs  up in front of the building and nuns tumble out
The nuns enter the casino and stop dead in their tracks
Before them is a large room filled with glitter and sin, the  of jackpots and crap tables
Brace yourselves, Sisters
In unison, the nuns all cross themselves
Spread out and look for Mary Clarence
Try to blend in
The nuns spread to every part of the room, looking for Christy
Page 110
blackjack table; a game is in progress, with several players
Mary Patrick rushes up to the table
Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun
Benedictine
The  and the players stare at the two nuns
Christy is making her way past a roulette table
Suddenly, she sees Joey coming toward her, making his way through the crowd
Christy grabs the arm of a playing roulette
Place your bets
(to the Salesman) Red 21
You sure
How do you know
Christy looks up to heaven
(to the Croupier) Red 21
Joey stands at the opposite side of the roulette table, glaring at Christy
The crowd around the table watches Christy for a moment, then they all put their chips down on Red 21
Joey starts working his way around the table toward Christy as the Croupier spins the wheel
The ball falls into a slot
Black 14
Everyone at the table turns toward Christy, outraged
She gives them a reprimanding look
Did you learn something
Christy suddenly realizes that Joey is almost at her side
She shoves the Salesman against him and runs away
Page 111
We see two long rows of slot machines, with gamblers working every machine
Willy appears at one end of the row, scanning the area for Christy
He sees a nun crossing at the far end of the row, and she moves out of sight
Willy heads in that direction
Someone hits a  behind him, and he turns toward the sound
As he does
he sees another nun crossing at the opposite end of the row of machines
Willy turns again -- now he sees three nuns crossing at the opposite end
He looks confused, and doesn't know which way to turn
- Eddie drives up in the squad car and parks near the back door
(to Clarkson) Close off the block, but don't move in till  tell you
Eddie jumps out of the car and hurries inside
As Christy moves past a blackjack game, she suddenly sees Vince moving toward her
Turning quickly, she moves away from Vince, but suddenly sees Joey coming toward her from the opposite direction
Trapped for a moment, she has panic in her eyes
Suddenly she is flanked by Mother Superior and Mary Patrick
What are you doing here
Saving you
Move
The nuns surround Christy and head through the crowd in a cluster
Joey and Vince pursue them from different directions
Just before they catch them, Mother Superior barks an order
Break
The nuns split up, each taking a different direction
Vince and Joey look bewildered
Get her
Which one
Page 112
The nun
Vince, Joey and Willy each pick a nun and follow her
Vince catches up to a nun, whom we only see from the rear
He grabs her shoulder
Babe
The nun spins around; it is Mother Superior
Sweetheart
Vince releases her and frantically searches the crowd again
Joey catches up with his nun, only to find it is Mary Patrick
The shell game has worked; Christy has escaped for the moment
We  Eddie scanning the floor and seeing nuns spread out everywhere
He talks quietly into his walkie-talkie
Move in
Seal off the exits, but don't come inside till  tell you
Vince, Joey and Willy run into each other in the center of the casino
There's nuns everywhere
Hundreds of 'em
All the nuns suddenly come together, and see that the exits are blocked by Vince and his hoods
Vince spots Christy in the center of the group
There she is
Which one
Christy sees Vince pointing at her
Quick, there's another way out of here
Follow me
Page 113
Christy runs toward a set of glass doors set off to one side
The other nuns follow her
She's heading for the lounge
Go
Vince, Joey and Willy head for the lounge
Across the room, Eddie sees Christy and the cluster of nuns head through the glass doors
He barks into his walkie-talkie
Move in -- now
The lounge is deserted between shows, and all the lights are out
The mobsters enter with guns drawn
can't see anything in here
Willy -- hit the lights
Where
Find 'em
Willy moves off to find the light switch
There is a flash of black and white fabric behind some chairs
There
Before he can shoot, there is another flash of fabric on the opposite side of the room
(aiming) No -- there
And a third flash of fabric near the stage
Over there
Willy has found the lights, and the lounge is suddenly brightly lit
The mobsters blink for a moment, then find all the nuns bunched together in a corner, trying to find an exit
Freeze
Everybody

The nuns turn and face the mobsters, shielding Christy
Joey
Where is she
Christy steps forward, to the front of the stage
Right here
Let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this
Joey -- do it
But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun
She's a broad
Got it
Just some broad
Mother Superior steps forward
(with authority) guarantee you, she is no broad
She is Sister Mary Clarence, of St
Katherine's Convent
She is a model of generosity, virtue and love
You have my word, gentlemen
She is a nun
Hear that
Now aren't you glad we didn't shoot her
Vince has had enough
Facing Christy, he raises the gun and points it right between Christy's eyes, only inches away
The nuns all recoil with horror
The gun goes off, but Christy isn't hit
She blinks her eyes open, shocked to be alive
Instead, it's Vince who falls, crumpling to the floor, and clutching his shoulder
Across the room, Eddie holds a smoking police revolver
The nuns all swarm around Christy joyously
Mary Clarence -- you're alive
(smiling) Christy
Page 115
(also smiling) Van Cartier
You know
About me
About everything
Christy breaks away from the jubilant nuns
She faces Mother Superior
Reverend Mother -- Thank-you
Oh
You saved my life
'm a Christian
Police pour into the room and gather up Joey, Willy and Vince
Eddie walks over to Christy and Mother Superior
Don't you have a concert to go to
That depends
Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning
That's bad news
don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true
Not a note
Impossible
Mary Lazarus coughs, and points to her throat, as if she has laryngitis
All the other nuns imitate her
(to Mother Superior) Then  guess you're stuck
Life sentence
No parole
Very well
(she turns to Eddie) hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent
For utterly disrupting our way of life
And for placing all of us in mortal danger
(sincerely, with a smile) Thank-you
Page 116
on Christy, watching this
She grins
Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch
Thanks for sticking me in a convent
So you think, after all this, maybe  really am a nun
don't know
There's only one way to be absolutely sure
Yeah, like what
Eddie takes Christy in his arms, and they begin a kiss
As they do so, Vince struggles toward Christy, as two cops hold him back
He is furious
was good to you
You re nothing but no-talent garbage
You're a two-bit Tramp
(staring at Vince, seeing him for the scum that he is) That used to be true, Vince
was with you
But something happened
And 'm different now
Real--different
've had, well, you might call it -- a religious experience
And 've got just two words for you
And those two words are
(afraid Christy will curse) Mary Clarence
(grinning, to Vince) Bless you
' People are pouring into the cathedral
Among them we see many Cardinals in their red uniforms
' The choir has gathered together in a small room off the main chapel
They are putting finishing touches on their choral robes, and are waiting nervously to go on
(to Christy) just realized -- this is the last time we'll all be together
We're going to miss you so much
Page 117
Christy and Mary Patrick embrace
Mary Patrick is tearful
Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one
Why do  suddenly feel like Snow White
(to Christy, with humor) You re okay -- for a civilian
Christy and Mary Lazarus embrace
Reverend Mother
Yes
Since Mary Clarence came to St
Katherine's, 've been shot at, kidnapped by Mafia hit men, and 've tasted beer
Is that enough experience yet
For final vows
don't think so
What about skydiving
crank call to Billy Graham
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert
We shall have a serious discussion
What about me, Reverend Mother
think you were right
'm just a bad influence
Sister show biz
Perhaps not
Perhaps we can all use
a little Spandex
Really
And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late
Don't push it
Christy and Mother Superior embrace
The chapel is packed to the rafters
The first few rows of pews are occupied by Cardinals
Television cameras glide up and down the aisles, angling for shots of the altar
Page 118
The Choir stands together on the altar with Christy in front
Behind them stands a much larger, all-city choir
Christy gives the nod to Sister Alma, and the organ vamp begins
It's true
-, ' Don't you know it
What did He say
,
' It's true --  know her
What a shame
Pay attention
Were you wicked
Were you tempted
Page 119
In the front row, Mother Superior is trying to resist the music
She gives in, and starts bobbing her head to the beat
Beside her, Eddie looks very proud as his eyes meet Christy's
But 'm fearful
And 'm tearful
' / ' Sing
/ ,
The entire congregation is ecstatic, as the song concludes with a glorious final flourish
