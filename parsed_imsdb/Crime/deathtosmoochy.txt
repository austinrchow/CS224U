by Adam Resnick December 2000 Early Draft - - man in a puffy foam-rubber rhinoceros costume dancing under the bright friendly lights of a television studio
Another rhino and various foam-rubber animals dance behind him to the happy
The rhino finishes his number and takes a bow
bleacher full of kids bursts into wild applause
- After the taping
The rhino lumbers down the hallway toward wardrobe
He is suddenly grabbed by two large men and dragged out through the exit into
where several   thugs in overcoats emerge from the shadows and start   beating him with lead pipes
One of the men pulls out   a  and  the rhino several times
The      through the empty garage
: : : : - It's the taping of another children's show -- "Rainbow Randolph and the Krinkle Kids
"  , a clean-cut man with a happy face and yellow bow tie, dances through Rainbowland with the "Krinkle Kids" (little people in top hats)
He sings one of his signature songs: "Friends Come In All Sizes
" One of the main Krinkle Kids --   -- dances behind him
(singing) 'Friends come in all sizes That's a fact
It's True
All colors of the rainbow from Mauve to Blue
() () 2
: (') Their names may not be different and their shoes may not match One might say 'grasp' while the other says 'snatch' Some like to toss while others like to caaaaatch
Beeee- caaaause
Friends come in all sizes Take it from me
Golly Gee
Size never matters when you want some friendly patter From a pal who is true and can lift you when you're blue You can count on him and he can count on yoooouuuu
It's true
that
(big finish) Friends come in all sizes
' : - "Sugar Rainbows Cereal," plastic toys lined up on store shelves, kids playing with Randolph dolls, kids eating "Rainbow Potato Chips" and "Rainbow Candies
"  "Rainbow Burster," a kind of gun that shoots plastic rainbows
Marquees announcing upcoming live appearances, etc
We get the picture
Rainbow Randolph is the king of the kid shows
-  - suburban-looking  and  enter
They find Rainbow Randolph sitting alone, drinking a Scotch
Hair slicked back, sans bow tie, the friendly face no longer looks so friendly
He nods for them to sit down
After a nervous beat, the Husband puts a briefcase on the table and slides it to Randolph
Randolph takes a gulp of his Scotch
He unsnaps the briefcase and opens it
Five grand stares him in the face
So
uh
you'll make sure my boy dances up front, right
Where he'll get the most camera time
Randolph slams the briefcase shut, startling the couple
You want your kid on the show
() 3
: Of
of course
Yes, very much
Then don't tell me how to run my fucking business
No, no, we were just -- Randolph rises
He takes a final gulp of his Scotch and picks up the briefcase
'll call you if a spot opens up
He starts to walk off
Suddenly, the Husband and Wife jump up from the table holding guns
Freeze, you cocksucker
Drop the briefcase
Federal agents storm into the bar and surround Randolph
- Bundles of the morning editions are tossed onto the curb from passing trucks
The various headlines blare: "    " "    " "  " - The Rainbow Randolph/Krinkle Kid set is being dismantled
Backdrops are rolled up and the giant rainbow centerpiece is wheeled off
Workers with push brooms sweep up tons of glittery "magic Rainbow dust
" -  - We are   the sweating face of a  who looks like he's about to be executed

is standing at the end of a long conference table as the glares at him
(addressing the brass) Gentlemen, let me be the first to say, in all sobriety, that 'm as shocked and outraged as all of -- The network , a hog of a man, cuts him off
Save it for the papers, Stokes
We've got nervous sponsors and an angry public -- a combination uglier than two monkeys fucking
What are you doing about it
Well, sir, 'm currently in the process of compiling a list of viable replacements and it's my hope
Clean replacements
With background checks
assure you, Mr
Stokes, this network cannot survive another Rainbow Randolph
The goddamn
department looks like the Jim Jones camp
Another  chimes in
#1 Remember, Stokes, this was your dog that crapped on our rug
#2 We trusted you, Frank
And now we're in a tight spot
We have to post our quarterly earnings next month, for Christ's sake
Whoever takes that slot has to be a straight arrow
Clean as a whistle
#3 Right
Someone who'll take the heat off
One of those sweater types
Any chance of luring Fred Rogers away from
() 5
: #4 Yeah, if we back up the Brinks truck
#1 No way
The idea now is to stop the hemorrhaging
#2 You better fix this, Stokes
Get us a white bread replacement, fast
Bland, milk toast
Not a speck of controversy
giant hand slams on the table
All heads snap
The  drags his fingers along the shiny mahogany
Deafening sound
(calm and measured) Squeaky fucking clean
'  - Stokes sits behind his mahogany desk, sipping a glass of wine as he goes over potential Randolph replacements with , his pretty protege
Bumble Bee Billy
(reading from a list) Wife beater
Square Dance Danny
Still appealing the mail fraud thing
Skippy Black and the Tippy Trolls
Black was deported, and the trolls
well, who gives a shit
Nora kicks the table in frustration
() 6
: This is impossible
If  ever see that Rainbow Randolph again 'll strangle him
Choke the life out of him
Squeeze his scrawny neck until his eyes pop out of his skull and bounce off the walls
Before indulging such cheery fantasies, let's just concentrate on saving my job
Shall we
Sorry, Frank
Stokes flips through a thick stack of files
He suddenly stops at one
What's going on with Sheldon Mopes these days
Nora laughs
Oh my God
Have we sunk to that level already
Smoochy the Rhino
What a sap
Sap's just the pill we need right now
Mopes is a straight arrow
Always has been
The guy can't get arrested, Frank
He can't even break into the birthday party circuit
Last heard he was working hospitals and nursing homes
He's a joke
Stokes stands up and walks around the room
The truth of the matter is, a successful children's show has always depended on two simple elements: a fuzzy costume and a lot of hype
Strip away the foam rubber and the network money and they're all jokes
Marginal talents
cabaret acts
off- Broadway runoff
() 7
: probably have ten acts in my development file -- acts 've been cultivating -- that are more deserving than Sheldon Mopes
And each one a moral question mark
Something  can't risk at the moment
(frustrated) We can do better than this guy, Frank
He brings nothing to the table
Except ethics
With Mopes, there's never been a whiff of controversy
The man's an ethical, harmless, cornball
In short, a glass of milk on two legs
Stokes stops pacing
Don't ask me to do it
You know 'll do anything for you, but please
not this
Stokes gazes out the window at the city
Go find Smoochy
- The lighted Ferris wheel spins
We and eventually   a side street with the amusement park looming in the b
g
We're in  of a small building
The half-lit neon sign reads: We   the double doors  the reception area where random junkies loiter and fill out paperwork
We   a narrow hallway as the faint sound of someone  and playing the
We finally burst another set of doors marked "Treatment Room
" The singing now fills our ears as we    the "performer" -- a big, puffy, orange rhinoceros
Smoochy
Or to be more specific,
() 8
: Smoochy sits on a stool with his guitar and sings to the patients as they stand in line before a sliding glass window, where a nurse hands each person a little cup of methadone which they immediately drink
The Smoochy costume is a mass of misshapen orange foam rubber that exposes Sheldon's painted face in the front
multi-colored horn protrudes from his forehead
() (singing to the tune of 'She'll be Comin' round the Mountain') 'We'll get that monkey off your back, Yes we will, yes we will We'll get that monkey off your back, Yes we will
' 'We'll get that monkey off your back And get your life right back on track If you'll just give up the smack Yes you will, yes you will
' The song ends
few baffled junkies applaud
Thanks, fellas
'm rooting for you
We    Sheldon  the exit
Standing there in her coat, looking mortified, is Nora
- Nora sits in the reception area
Sheldon emerges in his street clothes
He carries Smoochy's body on a hanger over his shoulder and carries a large shopping bag which holds Smoochy's head
Mr
Mopes
Sheldon stops
Yeah
() 9
: , uh, saw your performance tonight
Very
(searching) spirited
Really
Thanks
would've done a longer set if that guy hadn't pulled a knife on the security guard
Once the pepper spray starts flyin', that's it for the encores
Yes, that did put a damper on the evening, didn't it
Are you a new patient
On the juice, as we say
Ah, no
But it's sweet of you to assume so
She hands him her card
He reads it
'Nora Bishop
of Development
Kidnet
' (to Nora) Good gravy
You work for Kidnet
As stated
Sheldon grabs her hand and shakes it
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, Nora
real honor
Hey, you hungry
- '   - Sheldon and Nora stand at the crowded counter at Nathan's
Sheldon ravenously eats his sloppily- garnished, oddly colored hot dog
Nora winces as she watches him
() 10
: (with full mouth) Soy dogs
never thought 'd live to see the day
Organic, rich in natural protein, and nobody gets killed
Although do feel bad for the beans
Just kidding
Sure you don't want one
Believe it or not, no
He takes another bite
So anyway, like  was saying, people always tell me, 'You gotta network, Sheldon
you gotta sell yourself
or you'll be playing the drug clinics and shopping centers the rest of your life
' And you know what  tell 'em
haven't the foggiest
tell 'em, it's not about the old handshake and back slap game
It's not about adding fuel to the shlock machine
It's about doing good work
Having integrity
Making people happy and delivering a positive message
Foundations are built with concrete, not plaster of Paris
He pulls the stained, misshapen Smoochy head from the shopping bag
This is concrete
This is integrity
(calmly) can see that
Sheldon realizes his voice was getting too loud
Sorry
As you can imagine, living by your convictions can be a little stressful at times
() 11
: We all have our cross to bear
See,  was raised by my grandfather, and Grandpop paved driveways for a living
Are we going into a story
Thing is, he didn't really pave them
Just covered them with black paint
Of course, once the first rain came along, people realized they'd been swindled vowed to myself back then that 'd never make a living through deception
Never
Whadda ya think of them apples
Nora looks glassy-eyed
She takes a deep breath
The reason 'm here today, Mr
Mopes, as fate would have it, Kidnet is currently looking for a performer with
convictions
And integrity
Someone like
She almost chokes on the word
yourself
Sheldon laughs
Yeah, right
Got any more jokes
don't think  could top that one
Hold the phone
You're telling me that Kidnet is finally ready to do a show of Smoochy quality
Of Smoochy caliber
() 12
: (dryly) Yes
believe we're ready to push ourselves to that level
knew this day   would come
After all these   years  finally meet someone in   the business who gets what  do
Who gets what 'm all about
You    get me, don't you, Nora
'm afraid so
Well, Miss
of Development
let's go make history
: team of designers and seamstresses cut, sew and shape endless sheets of orange foam rubber
Sheldon stands on a wooden box as he's measured from head to toe
On the wall is a blueprint labeled "Smoochy the Rhino --
" costume designer walks over with the new Smoochy head and places it on Sheldon
As seamstresses fit him with the new Smoochy costume, various signs and billboards   the , trumpeting copy like: "'
" "    ,
" " " -
Sets, props, and camera equipment are rolled into the studio
Through a  of  we see the Smoochyland Magic Jungle take shape
- - choreographer maps out a number for Smoochy and the "Rhinettes
" (The Rhinettes are the former Krinkle Kid little people with horns strapped to their foreheads
) () 13
: Nora and Stokes watch from the wings with a mixture of uncertainty and disgust
: seamstress zips up the back of the finished, redesigned Smoochy costume
Sheldon stands proudly before the design team
Smoochy is now television ready: smoothed out, more colorful, less lumpy and exuding sunshiny happiness
: - - Smoochy is about to enter with the Rhinettes
, a former Krinkle Kid, stands beside him
Angelo, you were always my favorite Krinkle Kid
The way you'd click your heels during the 'Jellybean Jam
' Real artistry
'm honored to have you as a Rhinette
job's a job
- - Suddenly lights up in all its multi-colored Smoochyland glory
The bleachers are full of children
(
) Hey, kids
Who's your favorite rhino
The kids in the bleachers all scream in unison
Smoochy
Smoochy bounds out on stage followed by the Rhinettes who form a dancing circle around him
Hiya, kids
() 14
: Hi, Smoochy
It's gonna be a fantabulous day in Smoochyland
The kids cheer as Smoochy and the Rhinettes featuring Angelo Pike, go into their "It's a Fantabulous Day in Smoochyland" number -- a catchy, bouncy song and dance routine that plays out in the sugar-coated jungle of Smoochyland
(singing) 'Ohhhh
it's a fantabulous day in Smoochy-land/Let's have a great big cheer for the Smoochy-land band/We'll dance with our jungle pals, won't that be grand/Oh, it's a fantabulous day in Smoochy- land
' Smoochy dances right   the ,  the with his friendly, puffy face

The Brooklyn Bridge looms in the b

car pulls up in the b
g
Stokes gets out
Randolph moves under an awning
was starting to think that maybe you weren't coming
agreed to meet you, didn't had a dinner engagement
Randolph takes a swig from a flask
Really
You know,  used to have dinner engagements
Sometimes four, five a night
Dinner
drinks
was the toast of the fucking town
Don't start, Randolph
Please
() 15
: (voice rising) Cars, boats, whores and horses, had 'em all
When  walked into a restaurant, ten guys reached for my hat
When  stood up to take a piss, they cleared the rest room
'd walk down the street and traffic stopped, mouths gaped
You know why
You know why, Frank
(now shouting) was Rainbow fucking Randolph
That's why
Are you through
What
You're in a hurry
You don't have time for me
The guy who earned for you
The guy who put those fucking suits on your back and the pheasant au vin in your Brooklyn mouth
think it's fair to say we helped each other
Randolph suddenly breaks down
(pleading) You gotta fix it, Frank
You gotta get me my slot back
He now clings to Stokes' lapels
How can  sit around while that rhinoceros
that horned carpetbagger gets a free ride on my dime
You and  have history, Frank
Please
Stokes pries Randolph's hands from his overcoat
There's nothing  can do for you
Nothing
You're a pariah can't even be seen with you
() 16
: Don't do this to me, Frank
'm in deep, deep shit
They kicked me out of the corporate penthouse
got bookies breathing down my neck
'm homeless
Don't you hear what 'm saying
'm not gonna make it
The clock's ticking
Put yourself in my shoes, for Christ's sake
The ugly truth is, your shoes have become my shoes
As long as the rhino's on the air, everything's by the book
No skim, no percentage
Nothing
The network wanted squeaky clean and they got it
And believe me, Mopes is sparkling
He looks Randolph squarely in the eye
You're totally broke
You don't have a dime left to your name
Yes
Exactly
That's what 'm trying to tell you
Randolph looks at him hopefully as Stokes straightens his tie
Don't contact me again, Randy
Ever
Stokes walks off
Randolph watches him disappear through the mist
You'll get yours, Frank
The rhino too
Do you hear me
The wheels are turning
Stokes is gone
Randolph takes a swig from his flask and wipes his chin with his sleeve
He stares out at the river
(quietly to himself) Sooner or later, even a guy who's squeaky clean falls into mud

- of the docks as Randolph stands alone before the river
: '  - - as it erratically limps forward before The wind-up Smoochy lays upside-down on the carpet next to Nora's desk, legs grinding lamely in the air
Various Smoochy items are spread out on her desk top restless-looking Sheldon and a few members of Nora's staff are in on the meeting
Again, these are just prototypes
've been assured by FunZone that all the bugs will be worked out before Christmas
Sheldon raises his hand
Nora ignores him and looks at her watch
Okay, so let's recap before we break up
(refers to notes) Yes to the Smoochy ice pops
No to the Smoochy string cheese
And we're in a dick-measuring contest with Brown & Brown over the shampoo split
Sheldon suddenly stands up
Okay, time out, people
If  may interject,  think we're putting the cart before the horse here
Nora throws him an icy look
() 18
: Smoochy's still earning the trust of the kids
We don't want to compromise that by asking them to buy shampoo and cheese
How 'bout we just concentrate on doing the best show possible
Huh
Without all the bells and whistles and rickata-rackita
What do you say, guys
Nora casually picks up a Smoochy Frisbee from her desk and sails it toward the open door
It lands in the hallway
(monotone) Oh, damn
No problem, 'll get it
He walks out to the hallway
(to staffer) Shut the door please, John
John shuts the door
Now lock it
He locks it
Thank you
- Nora emerges from the revolving door of the Kidnet building which is located in the heart of Times Square and heads down Broadway
Sheldon emerges from the building
Hey, Nora, wait up
She keeps walking
Sheldon catches up and walks alongside her, occasionally getting jostled by passersby
() 19
: Good meeting today
thought we tackled some hot issues
Although, 'll be honest, there were a few times that  felt my voice wasn't being heard
think that's a conservative estimate
just want the show to have some weight, you know
Some substance
Silly songs, sure -- but with a message
Pop quiz: How many original compositions are in the Smoochy songbook
Do you sense my complete lack of interest
Try two thousand
Covering every topic from how yummy vegetables are to the importance of donating plasma
Don't you get it, Nora
'm a valuable resource
Use me
Nora stops
She looks Sheldon in the eye for the first time
Can  make this real easy for you
Sure
The only reason you're on  right now is because Rainbow Randolph is a degenerate scumbag
didn't discover you,  delivered you
Like a bag of groceries
have a bigger emotional investment in my nail polish
So don't peddle your sap to me, rhino
Your job is just to smile and nod your head
She walks off
20
' - Sheldon sits at the bar in the restaurant, nursing a drink and talking to the
He seems slightly drunk
No, no, you misunderstand me
It's not that 'm literally comparing Captain Kangaroo to Jesus Christ
'm just saying that the Captain, like Christ, was someone you could believe in
Those guys didn't care about bells and whistles and rickita-rackata
It was all about the work
Especially Jesus
Forget about it
The Bartender nods and starts to pour Sheldon another drink
(waving him off) That's okay, my good man
Three's my limit
never saw anyone get loaded on orange juice before
Back in my college days  could put away a carton of the stuff
sharply-dressed man,  , sits down next to Sheldon
(to Bartender) Gimme a Five Crown
The Bartender nods
He looks over at Sheldon
Smoochy the Rhino
Wow
'm a big fan
(flattered) Gee, thanks
usually don't get recognized without my horn
Burke extends his hand
Burke Bennett
represent kid show talent
21
' - Sheldon and Burke now sit at a corner table
Look, Shel, Frank Strokes ain't in the business to make you rich
He's in it to make Frank Stokes rich
That's how these network goons operate
That's so sad
Is it just me, or is that sad
You know, years ago, a client of mine, Dicky Gimble, was having a problem
Wow, you represented Dicky Gimble
Yeah, before the asshole found religion
Anyway, Stokes was trying to screw my boy out of some merchandising points
Claimed he had a warehouse full of Dicky dolls that weren't moving
Now Frank and  are old friends, so say to him, 'Okay, cock, show me the warehouse' -- see,  know the fucking warehouse is in the Bronx, and  know it's emptier than my wife's head
(chuckles) To make a long story short,  walk out with a check for a hundred grand and Stokes is sitting there with his thumb up his ass
Burke laughs
That's very amusing, but  don't care about Smoochy dolls and Smoochy floor wax
just want more creative input
This rhino came from my womb
bore him, nursed him, and dammit
He pounds his fist on the table
() 22
: should be the one who raises him
Shel, it's all about the dough
After you get the money, you get the power
And after you get the power, you can have Smoochy walk on stage with a hard-on if you want
It's funny, that never crossed my mind
Burke downs the rest of his drink and stands up
Unfortunately, until then
you're just another puppet in the prop room
He hands Sheldon his card
Give me a call when you're ready, kid
'll cut the strings and open the magic door for you
' - Randolph peers through the restaurant's front window
He shivers from the cold as he watches Sheldon and Burke shake hands
Burke heads for the exit
Randolph quickly ducks into the shadows
moment later, Burke exits the club and walks down the street
Randolph pops out
saw you
saw you in there
at my table
talking to him
Yeah, so what do you want parade
You're my agent
Or did you forget that
() 23
: Not anymore, pal
You're a cigarette butt
Go lay in the gutter
Burke walks off
- In the litter-strewn alley, we   several grocery bags, broken egg shells, flour bags, butter wrappers, mixing bowls and other baking ingredients
The Randolph, who stands over a barrel fire, holding a spatula
cookie sheet rests on the barrel
Randolph removes the cookie sheet and gazes at it gleefully
We now see that the cookies are phallic-shaped
Ah
They're beautiful
perfect batch of cock cookies for a very special rhino
He sets the tray aside
Oh yes, you're going to learn about shame, my dear Smoochy
And 'm your professor
He laughs
-   - It's thirty minutes before a Smoochy taping
Dozens of giddy children are led into the studio where they take seats on the bleachers
Sheldon, in the Smoochy costume, sans head, lumbers up to Nora
He holds a rundown for that day's show
Excuse me, Nora
Why was the 'Please and Thank You Song' cut
Because it's sappy and it takes away from the 'Cookie Song
' () 24
: Takes away
It enhances it
The cookie song is a meaningless piece of fluff without the 'Please and Thank You' coda
That's the moral anchor
That's where the lesson is
You can't sell the sizzle without the steak
It's cut
And  want the 'Cookie Song' lyrics changed back to the way they were originally scripted
can't do that
will not condone children consuming endless amounts of refined sugar
have to look myself in the mirror every morning
This is network television, not a sprout farm
We're here to sell sugar and plastic
That's what keeps the lights on
You're treating me like a puppet
You know that
Well, guess what
am not your puppet
Since when
Now get your spongy orange ass out there and dance for the cameras
An angry Sheldon storms off in frustration, but then stops
He looks back at her
We have different eyes, Nora
When  go out there  see kids
You see wallets with pigtails
He moves on
Nora stares at him as he walks away
He obviously got to her
As Sheldon heads toward the studio, he doesn't notice the two beady eyes staring at him from under the stairwell
After a beat, Randolph emerges and slinks backstage
He's clutching a duffle bag
25
- Randolph sneaks into the prop room and shuts the door
He scurries over to the prop shelf and locates Smoochy's multicolored "magic cookie bag
" He opens it and tosses the cookies into the trash can
Reaching into his pockets, he pulls out his special homemade cookies
He chuckles as he dumps them into the magic cookie bag
Bon soir, la Smoochy
Welcome to fatty Arbuckle-land
He cackles to himself
He then notices a box in the corner of the room
Scribbled in magic marker on the side are the words: "Rainbow Randolph crap
" He walks over and pulls the box out
He slowly opens the flaps
Inside is his old costume
He pulls it out and clutches it lovingly
He smells it
The   of his comes flooding back to him for a moment, along with the sound of
(softly to himself) Don't worry, little ones
Rainbow Randolph will return
(with rising anger) After these messages
He holds up Smoochy's magic cookie bag
He then stuffs his old costume into his duffle bag
- The "Smoochy Show" is in the middle of a taping
The Smoochyland Band is playing a fast, jazzy number ("Doin' the Jiggy Ziggy") as Smoochy, the Rhinettes, and several kids dance frenetically
The kids in the bleachers are in hysterics as Smoochy shakes his body spastically
The song finally ends
The kids in the bleachers jump to their feet, cheering and applauding
Boy, all that jiggyin' and ziggyin' sure makes a fella hungry
Now if only  had my super duper, super secret, super special
The kids in the bleachers erupt in unison: Magic Cookie Bag
() 26
: Right-o-riffic
(looks skyward) Magic Cookie Bag,  command thee
Come to your lord and master
The lights dim as the Smoochyland Band plays the "2001 theme
" Smoochy's Magic Cookie Bag is lowered from the ceiling by a filament wire
The kids go crazy
(singing) 'Lookie, lookie, lookie, here comes the cookies
Fresh and organic, no need to panic
Right from the soil, no tropical oils
Sweetened with juice, for an energy boost
Fiber galore, you'll be askin' for more
' She looks pissed, but then looks over at the kids in the bleachers
Their faces are filled with laughter
For the first time she feels the connection Smoochy has with them
He peers out from his hiding place backstage
His eyes widen with delight as the Magic Cookie Bag continues its descent
The cookie bag finally reaches Smoochy
He holds the bag high above his head in a religious ceremonial fashion as the Rhinettes and the kids crowd around him
Oooh
just the smell of unprocessed flour makes my tummy do somersaults
(under his breath) Whatever that means, you fucking retard
() 27
: His puffy orange hand reaches for the bag's clasp as the reaches its
He's practically shaking as he suppresses an insane laugh
Give 'em a cookie
give 'em a cookie
He reaches into the bag, and with a grand flourish, pulls out a flaming red penis cookie
The cookie is somewhat misshapen and not perfectly formed
Smoochy gets a big grin
Wow
Look at this cookie, kids
rocket ship
The kids "ooh" and "ahh
" He looks confused
What a special day with such special cookies
Smoochy pretends to "zoom" the penis cookie through the air
Rrrrrrrr
Look at me, kids
'm flying to the moon
'm flying to Mars
'm flying to -- Randolph, whose face is now bright red, can't take it anymore
He runs onto the stage
He grabs the rocket cookie from Smoochy
() 28
: Are you fucking blind
It's a cock
Not a space ship
Cock
Cock
- Three burly Kidnet security guards drag Randolph down the stairwell
They beat the shit out of him and toss him through the exit door
'  - - The headline reads: "Rainbow Randolph Interrupts Smoochy Taping
" The subhead reads: "Runs Onstage Shouting Penis Related Obscenities
" Burke sits on the couch next to Sheldon, reading the paper
He shakes his head in disgust
Nora sits in a chair near Stokes
Thank you all for coming
just wanted to iron out a few wrinkles feel we're having in the communication department
No finger-pointing
Lord knows when you start pointing fingers, someone gets poked in the eye
Sheldon laughs
Stokes and Nora sit stone-faced
Anyhoo, 'd like to turn the floor over to my new agent, Mr
Burke Bennett
So
heeeeeere's Burke
Sheldon applauds
Burke stands
As you can imagine, my client has many concerns, not the least of which is studio security, but we can address that later
He pats Sheldon's head like a dog
() 29
: See this guy, Frank
Take a good long look, 'cause this prick saved your life
Without him you'd be sitting in Kaplan's right now, sucking club soda through a paper straw
(to Nora) And, you -- you'd be organizing puppet shows for the brats at 86
Excuse me, honey
There's no excuse for you
Man,  love club soda
Sheldon laughs, trying to lighten the mood
Burke gives him an affectionate slap
We've always managed to come to some sort of arrangement, Burke
Why the fireworks
'Cause 'm holding all the gunpowder
represent the man who created, owns, and controls every square inch of Smoochy the Rhino
Burke pours himself a drink from Stokes' private bar
God created Adam and what did he get
fucking dud
My guy
He breathed life into a winner
And anyone who does a better job than God is gonna have a price
Burke, of course, is in no way comparing me to God
Yes  am
() 30
: You seem to forget that we went out and found 'your guy
' Dug up his corpse
Handed him his own show when he couldn't sell his face to a photo booth
To be fair, Nora,  was booked to open a car wash in Montauk
Oh, so you were doing him a favor
(chuckles) Allow me to untangle this web of shit
don't care what his resume was,  don't care where you found him,  don't care if his last job was juggling apples for a hut full of Pygmies on the outskirts of the Congo
the fact is, he fits a bill and you need him
Like a hungry baby needs a big tit
And that, my friends, is why you're in a box with no ventilation
And that is why the rhino is going to get what he deserves
What is that, exactly
Burke walks over to Stokes' desk and leans across it
He's an inch from Stokes' face
Heaven, hell, and everything in between
'  - - being popped as foamy champagne runs down the bottle
Sheldon and Burke sit at a table in the nightclub
Burke raises his glass
() 31
: To the star and new executive producer of the Smoochy show
May your reign be a long and healthy one
They clink glasses
'm still in shock
Complete creative control, part ownership of the show, discretion over merchandising and a dressing room with a toilet
Am  dreaming or what
And don't forget the corporate penthouse
It took me six years to get that for Randolph
Boy, imagine
me, living in a penthouse
Who'd a thunk it
It's called the high life, kid
Get used to it
Pretty soon you'll be burnin' one hundred dollar bills just to see Franklin break a sweat
Jeez,  hope not
have a deep respect for money
Not to mention Ben Franklin who had some remarkable achievements in his lifetime
Burke pulls out a paper bag and hands it to Sheldon
What's this
That's your graduation present
Something you're gonna need now
Sheldon reaches in the bag and pulls out a revolver
He recoils in horror and immediately drops it back in the bag
() 32
: Think of it as a tool of the trade
've never owned a gun, 've never touched a gun, and  don't believe in guns
When  played cowboys and Indians as a kid,  was always the Chinese railroad worker
Trust me, Shel
It's a handy accessory in this business
Even if you don't load it, have it for show
Sometimes that's all you need
Especially with a creep like Randolph lurking around
Burke and Sheldon look up and notice the hulking, grinning figure of   standing over them
Spinner has the smile of a little boy despite his crooked nose and scarred face
He extends his hand
Hiya, Smoochy
'm Spinner
Spinner
Hi there
'm so excited to meet you
'm Spinner
Spinner's massive hand engulfs Sheldon's
(remembers) Oh
right
saw you fight on once
think it was your farewell bout
: -
() - Through a    we see Spinner getting pummeled in various fights
() 33
: #1 Tonight marks Spinner Dunn's final appearance in the ring
What a pleasure it's been to watch him proudly march into the record books for taking more blows to the head than any fighter in history
bloodied, defeated Spinner happily holds up the arm of his opponent after a match
He then hugs the referee
He jumps down from the ring and hugs the three judges
#2 Scrambled a bit
Sure
You don't retire with a record of 81-59 and wind up the Governor
But on the upside, he's got the disposition of a collie
Spinner wades into the stands and starts hugging the spectators
: '  () Spinner is still pumping Sheldon's hand
You know what  love, Smoochy love when you do the Jiggy Ziggy dance
You know, the one you do during 'Silly Time
' You bet
That's a big one
Wanna see me do it
Well,  don't know why if there's enough room here to
Spinner starts Jiggying and Ziggying for Sheldon
He bangs into a table and knocks over someone's drink
Okay, champ, don't get overheated
Spinner stops, out of breath
He leans over and hugs Sheldon
() 34
: love you
uh
love you, too, Spinner
powerful-looking woman,  , calls to Spinner from the bar
Spinner, come over and meet the Senator
Spinner dutifully hurries over to Tommy
He seems pretty popular
It must take real talent to run a place like this
Spinner
The guy couldn't run a water faucet
He's just a mascot
It's his cousins, a bunch of Irish mob boys, who really run the joint
He shakes the Senator's hand as Tommy and a few other tough Irish guys stand around
Spinner looks over towards Sheldon
(loudly) Don't go anywhere, Smoochy
'll be right back after  take a dump
Spinner releases the Senator's hand and rushes off
think you made a new friend, kid
35
' (  ) - We met him backstage with Smoochy
innocent face
Angelo stirs a pot of soup in the worn-down but tidy apartment
"Rhinette" costume is draped over one of the chairs
There is a sudden   on the door
Angelo puts the spoon down and reaches behind some spices on the shelf above
He pulls out a revolver
The continues
Yeah, who is it
(
) (friendly) Open up, buddy
It's me, Randolph
It's been a long time
Angelo puts the gun in his waistband and walks to the door
He slowly slides the chain off and opens the door a crack
Peering in at him are the bloodshot eyes of Rainbow Randolph
Randy
Randolph suddenly kicks the door open and tackles Angelo
Randolph sits on top of the little man
You fucking traitor
My body's barely cold and already you work for the rhino
don't know what you're talking about
Don't lie to me
heard all about it
You strapped that horn on faster than a cheerleader gets the clap
gotta eat, don't
You're a Krinkle Kid
Not a Smooch-bag
Say it
Rhinette
() 36
: Say it:  am a Krinkle Kid
Say it, before God
On the soul of Jesus Christ
Say what you are
Angelo punches Randolph in the mouth and flips him over
He now sits on Randolph, pointing the revolver to his face
'm a Rhinette
Got that
The Krinkle Kids are ten feet under
With you
Randolph starts crying like a child
(blubbering) missed you so much
Can  stay here
got no place to go
Angelo sighs and puts the gun away
'  - Angelo and Randolph sit at the small kitchen table
Angelo watches as Randolph ravenously eats a bowl of soup
They kicked me out of the corporate penthouse
Big surprise
Sons-a-bitches
That's how  got this beauty
He points to a nasty bump near his eye
And of course, there's this
He yanks his lip back to reveal a missing tooth
That happened after my little visit to the studio the other day
Network security
Fucking savages
He slurps another spoonful of soup and spits a bay leaf on the floor
() 37
: got liens, back taxes, lawyer's bills, threats against my life
basically got the whole fucking world up my ass
It's okay,  got a loooong memory, son
(Amos and Andy dialect) What dey sow, dey gonna reap
He cackles insanely as he picks up a bottle of gin and takes a deep swig
He passes out and falls off the chair
Angelo leans down and lifts his head off the floor
Stop doing this to yourself
Randolph doesn't respond
Angelo slaps his face
Wise up
You hear me
Don't piss your life away like this
(half-conscious) It's the rhino, Angie
He's been sent by the devil
Sent from hell to destroy me
Smoochy
is the face of evil
( ) - We are  the smiling goofy face of Sheldon, whose picture graces the front page of Variety under the headline, "
" The subhead reads, "
"  dollar bill is slapped down over the picture
We   to see Sheldon buying the magazine at the newsstand in front of the Kidnet Building
He turns and walks toward the Kidnet entrance
He stops and looks up at the building
Smiling, he takes a deep breath and enters
- Sheldon whistles as he walks down the hall, giving cheerful "hellos" and "good mornings" along the way
He enters Nora's office
38
'  - Nora is on the phone
She pretends not to notice him
Sheldon bides his time by inspecting knickknacks, examining photos on the wall, etc
Finally, he half- whispers/half-mouths to her: Whenever you get a chance just need a second
(into the phone) Listen, can  call you back
Yeah, some asshole's screaming in my ear
Thanks
She hangs up
'm sorry, you didn't have to hang up
If  didn't you'd still be here
But  am still here
'm hoping to correct that
Nora,  want us to start off on the right foot
want you to know that  value your input and don't want you to feel intimidated just because the power structure has changed a bit
consider you a partner
Great
That'll come in handy if we're ever at a square dance
Well,  was never much of the do- se-do type, but what  would love to do is take you out to lunch one day
You know, just two colleagues chewing the fat
forming a mutual respect
planting the seeds of cooperation
() 39
: No
Fair enough
If you change your mind -- won't
Sheldon just nods and starts to exit
Okay then, 'll be in my office if you need me
If you want to brainstorm about anything
Ideas and so forth
He passes a plant by the door
Ficus
She ignores him
He exits
- Sheldon walks slowly down the hallway
He no longer has a bounce in his step
'   - Sheldon enters his plush new office, awkwardly walks over to his new desk and sits behind it for the first time
Wow
(
) My cousin Spinner's take quite a shine to you
Sheldon jumps
He's surprised to Tommy from Spinner Dunn's restaurant
Tommy's crew, , ,  and occupy the sofa
Ever since you came in the restaurant
He can't stop yakkin'
() 40
: Well, he's a very nice man
Very sweet disposition for someone that size
So,  was wondering if maybe you could give him a little floor space
'm sorry
You know, a little part on the show
You're the executive producer now
You call the shots, right
Uh, that's a very sweet offer, and love Spinner, but  is a complicated medium and
mean, that would be like me getting into the ring with a prizefighter
(laughs) Can you imagine such a thing
Boom
What's the alphabet, Mommy
Sheldon laughs again
Tommy gets quiet
This makes me sad
Very, very, sad
What's wrong, Tommy
Nothing
'm just very sad right now
Who made you sad, Tommy
don't want to mention names
The guys look menacingly at Sheldon
They rise and walk around his desk until they're on either side of him
() 41
: You know what
Maybe  can find Spinner a little something to do on the show
That's probably the best solution
Tommy now smiles and walks over to Sheldon
She musses Sheldon's hair
You're a good boy, Mopes
Don't think we don't remember favors
: '  - Sheldon is in a meeting with a man,
Look,  appreciate the visit, but 'm just putting together a little petting zoo segment
Nothing fancy -- a few kittens
maybe a duck
:     , ,  ' 358 If you're looking to bring in that many pieces  gotta put a crew together
Plus, we're lookin' at transpo, a few leash handlers, a cleanup boy and a doper to keep the inventory quiet
Jeez, this all sounds awfully elaborate
might have to forgo the union and just borrow a few animals from a pet shop
wouldn't recommend it
Miss Carol from Romper Room tried that once and she's still limping
-- 42
'  - frazzled-looking Sheldon is meeting with
On behalf of FunZone Toys, 'd like to congratulate you on your recent promotion, and present you with a small gift
:    ,
, Ben reaches into his breast pocket and drops a large wad of money on Sheldon's desk that lands with a thud
Uh
that's nice of you, Ben, but a card would have been fine
FunZone Toys would very much like the Smoochy contract, Mr
Mopes
Is this
mean
are you offering me a bribe or something
FunZone Toys would very much like the Smoochy contract, Mr
Mopes
Sheldon picks up the money and tosses it back to Ben
Sheldon rises from his desk
Normally, sir, we take the trash out at the end of the day, but think 'll make an exception in your case
Sheldon escorts Ben out the door and slams it shut
The Sheldon walks over and picks it up
Yes
(
) Mr
Feedlepepper on line two
Who
(
) He says he's an old friend
Sheldon punches line two
() 43
: Hello
: '  - (
) You better grow eyes on the back of your fucking head, you horned piece of shit
won't sleep until the worms are crawlin' up your foam rubber ass
'm going on safari, motherfucker
safari
Sheldon hangs up stunned
Nora walks in holding the daily news
Congratulations on your little ice show
What are you talking about
It didn't take you long to sell out, did it
She tosses the paper on his desk
What happened to your precious integrity
Or was that just part of your dog and pony act
She exits
confused Sheldon looks at the "Around Town" column
- "
"      The subhead reads: "   -- " : 44
' - We are   the feet of an Irish dancer doing a sort of Riverdance
We   and the rest of the dancers come
Spinner and the mob ar clapping and whooping
Sheldon and Burke sit at a table in the dark club having a conversation
Burke,  never agreed to do an ice show
Shel, do you know what kind of cash we'll take in between the gate and concessions
venture like this gets you money and muscle
Times twenty
Ice shows represent everything 'm against
They're mindless spectacles whose main purpose is to sell overpriced sugar-water and cheap plastic toys that splinter in a kid's mouth on the ride home
Look,  know you got this fetish for ethics, but now's not the time to fly that kite
No one's ever refused a shot at an ice show
Sheldon tears the contract in half
Until now
Smoochy doesn't sell out, Burke
You should be proud of that
Proud that you represent a client who paves driveways, not paints them over
'm thrilled, Shel
Knocked out
Burke just sits there, stunned
waitress, , passes by the booth
'll have a pineapple juice, Sandy
() 45
: Pineapple
What happened to orange juice
'm feeling feisty tonight
- We are now on a drum solo
Ernie the Elephant of the Smoochyland Band works it
The animal band plays a sloppy version of "Pop Goes the Weasel
" End on Spinner Dunn -- the newest and by far largest member of the band
Spinner holds s cowbell and seems to be concentrating intently on the proper moment to hit it
Unfortunately, his rhythm is off, which throws the rest of the band off as well
We   to see Smoochy and the Rhinettes attempting to dance to the off-kilter rhythm
The song finally ends
The Rhinettes glare at Spinner
Smoochy addresses the camera
Boy, wasn't that fun
In an awkward kind of way
Anyhoo, how 'bout a big round of applause for the newest member of the Smoochyland Band
former heavyweight contender, Spinner Dunn
Spinner stands up to take a bow and almost knocks the entire bandstand over
There is a smattering of confused applause from the kids in the bleachers
Spinner drops the cowbell and it clangs on the studio floor
Shit
Sorry
- beaming Spinner runs up to Sheldon, who's still in costume
Did  do good, Sheldon, huh
Did do good
() 46
: Yeah, that was great, Spinner
Just watch your elbow next time
Pinky's probably gonna lose that tooth
Okey doke
'm gonna go get drunk now
Spinner skips off humming "Pop Goes the Weasel" and banging his cowbell
Nora passes Sheldon backstage
Nice job
Casting the show with mental patients,  like that
(snapping) He is not a mental patient
He's an ex-boxer and nightclub owner who happens to have the sweet innocent brian of a five-year-old
Excuse me for not making the distinction
She leaves
( ) - Sheldon exits the Kidnet building and walks to the curb to hail a cab
friendly-looking man in a suit and bow tie approaches him
This is
Hi there
Hi
limo pulls up in front of them
Merv opens the back door
Get in
Thanks anyway, but 'm going uptown
() 47
: Merv pulls his jacket back to reveal a revolver tucked in his waistband
Humor me, rhino
- Sheldon slides into the back seat of the limo
big thug in an overcoat, , is already sitting there
Merv gets in behind him and shuts the door
Sheldon is now wedged between the two men as the limo heads down Broadway
Merv extends his hand
Merv Green, Sheldon
It's a pleasure to meet you
If you're hoping for an autograph, the gun's a bit much
The whole 'catch more flies with honey' thing -- it really holds water
Sheldon laughs nervously
Sheldon,  represent the Parade of Hope Foundation
Maybe you've heard of us
You raise money to build children's hospitals, right
We've been known to add a brick or two, sure
Merv and the thug laugh
Sheldon, let me get right to the point -- there's talk on the street that you're pulling out of the ice show
Is that true
() 48
: (big sigh) You know,  never agreed to an ice show, nor would  ever agree to do an ice show, and let me add that none of this is your concern, sir
(shakes his head) Sheesh
Listen carefully, son: Parade of Hope has sponsored every Kidnet ice show since 1964
We take a piece off the top and everybody walks away happy
So let's not buck history
Well,  appreciate the offer, but for the gazillionth time, 'm not doing an ice show, so we have nothing to discuss
Now, if you'll just pull over, 'll get out and we'll say our toodley-dos
(to driver) Far corner, please
Allow me to be less murky
Starting tomorrow, Smoochy the Rhino raises his baton for Parade of Hope
Benefits, banquets, fund-raisers,  want it all
(to driver) Pull over, Terry
The car pulls to the curb
And as far as the ice show goes
recommend you start shopping for skates
The door pops open and Sheldon is tossed out
49
- troubled-looking Sheldon stands on his balcony looking out at the city
He drinks orange juice straight from the carton
Sheldon is on the phone with Burke
This is unacceptable, Burke
'm calling the authorities
(
) Don't do it, Shel
You rat on Parade of Hope and you'll be lucky if they find your toenails
These guys are the roughest of all the charities
was threatened by an organization that's supposed to help children
What kind of world is this
(
) The real one
My advice
Consider the ice show and stay healthy
Burke hangs up
After a beat, Sheldon's
He walks over to the door and opens it
To his surprise, Nora is standing there
May  come in
Sure
Nora enters
She seems a little wobbly
Sheldon notices she's holding a pint of whiskey
Uh
are you okay
'm getting drunk and 'm not used to it
Oh
Well, not to make you feel worse, but with alcohol you're also consuming empty calories
Nora looks at him for a moment
() 50
: It's just that
want to apologize, actually
And on those rare occasions when  feel the need to apologize for something, it helps if 'm, you know
shit- faced
Wow
'm honored
Nora trips slightly
Sheldon takes the whiskey from her
Why don't we get some air
He leads her out on the balcony
They look out at the city
may have been a little harsh when we spoke the other day
little out of line
Well, it wasn't as bad as the week before when you called me a pasty- faced, no-talent hack
Yes, that was probably insensitive as well
(looks at him) heard you're not doing the ice show
find that
incredibly admirable
Why didn't you tell me
guess  didn't want to spoil your fun
You look so content when you're berating me
Nora looks down
'm afraid  have become a bit hardened over the years
Sincerity's an easy disguise in this business
It's hard to know who's on the level
() 51
: Believe me, 'm learning that more and more every day
(wistfully) 'Sometimes light is really dark, Sometimes crows can sing like larks Sometimes Winter feels like Spring, Don't think you know everything
' (in disbelief) 'Rickets the Hippo'
You remember Rickets
That was my favorite show when was a kid
Rickets was the one face  knew  could trust
That's how  felt
Rickets had real depth
He was my inspiration for Smoochy
Really
He was my inspiration to work in children's television
can't believe it
never met anyone who even remembers Rickets
Do you remember the Klunky-Wunky dance
Remember it
did it at my first communion
Sheldon starts doing the rather insane-looking Klunky- Wunky dance
Nora does it with him
They both stop and look at each other
Sheldon impulsively leans in and kisses her
'm sorry
That was a mistake, right
didn't mean for that to hap-- Nora grabs his head and pulls it toward her
They begin kissing passionately
() 52
: (as they kiss) You're not full of shit like all the others, are you
No, no
(as they kiss) You're for real, right
Yes, yes
(through the kisses) mean,  couldn't tell
First thought it was an act
and then just thought you were a simp or something
Shhh
you don't have to explain
They continue to kiss
Nora abruptly stops
should go
Why
Nora exits the balcony and collects her coat and purse
What's wrong
Is it the whiskey
If you have to throw up, be my guest
Anywhere you like
It's just getting late
Sheldon follows her to the door
She stops and looks at him for a moment
The  starts to
Neither of them says anything for a beat
Better get that
Good night
She exits
Sheldon shuts the door and sighs
He goes to the bar to pour himself another orange juice before picking up the phone

Randolph is on the He lies on his bed in Angelo's apartment wearing a bathrobe with a towel wrapped around his head
His head dangles off the bed as he talks on the phone
The  is reminiscent of Bye Bye Birdie
Hello, Mr
Mopes
My name is Benjamin Kunklepeck and 'm calling on behalf of 'Parents for Decency in Children's Television,' perhaps you've heard of us
No, but  like where you're coming from
It's an issue very close to my heart
Why just yesterday was commenting -- Sir, we're having a banquet tomorrow and we'd be honored to have you perform for us
We would also like to present you with a plaque for your ongoing commitment to children's television
The presenter will be a young orphan with mild asthma
Can you attend
- black Lincoln Town Car travels across the bridge toward Staten Island
(
) Thanks for picking me up, Mr
Kunklepeck
It's very nice of you
- Sheldon is in the back seat
The Smoochy costume is next to him
Behind the wheel is Randolph
He's in disguise
() 54
: Don't be silly
The chance to have Smoochy the Rhino perform at our little soiree
'd carry you piggy-back through a bed of hot rusty glass if  had to
Well, it's always a pleasure to help out a worthy cause
And believe me, 've learned lately that it's not all sunshine and daffodils in the land of non- profit
just looove your show, by the way
It's such a refreshing change of pace from that dreadful embezzler
what's his name again
Rainbow something or other
Randolph
Yes
Rainbow Randolph
What a scoundrel
He's probably gay too
Oh,  don't know
feel sorry for him, actually
He obviously has problems or issues that he needs to sort out
(getting frustrated) Yeah, yeah, yeah, but don't you take particular glee in that you basically stole his time slot
Helped shovel dirt onto his miserable corpse, as it were
No,  would never take pleasure in someone's downfall
You know the old expression about walking a mile in another man's shoes
Well, that really holds water
Just try to imagine -- () 55
: (snapping) Come on, he's a fucking asshole
You hate him
Admit it
(uncomfortable) Uh
can we listen to the radio
- The Town Car is parked behind an old warehouse in the middle of nowhere
Sheldon is now in costume
Randolph rushes out of the door, very excited
Okay, they're ready for you
gotta say, this is a first -- never performed in a tractor parts warehouse before
Well, we like to do these things no-frills
It's all about the kids
Amen to that
Randolph opens the door a crack and listens
We hear an from inside
(
) It gives me great pleasure to introduce our very special guest
a supporter of the cause and a friend to the brotherhood
Please welcome, the one, the only
Smoochy the Rhino
We hear
Randolph quickly opens the rusty door
Knock 'em dead, kid
He shoves Sheldon inside
- Sheldon runs in and immediately starts singing and dancing on the makeshift stage
() 56
: 'Well, how-do-you-do, my   good friends
How do-you-do,    my pals
It's so nice to see good   friends
Sing along with me now
How do you do, my good -- ' Sheldon abruptly stops singing as a look of shock comes over him
his troubled face
- ' Several hundred men in Nazi uniforms in a warehouse draped in swastikas
They all start chanting: Heil Smoochy
Heil Smoochy
Heil Smoochy
huge swastika banner unfurls behind Smoochy, framing him like Patton in front of the American flag
Flashbulbs go off
The "Heil Smoochys" continue starts to  from the
Looking stunned, Sheldon slowly leans into the mic
He clears his throat
The
Everyone quiets down
He searches for just the right words, and finally
It's my sincere hope that 'm dreaming right now, but in the event that 'm not
what's the deal with the swastikas
Suddenly, a sea of policemen bursts into the warehouse
This is an unlawful assembly, you kraut sons-a-bitches
You're all under arrest
Pandemonium ensues us all the Nazis run for cover
Sheldon stands in the middle of it all, unsure what to do
- Sheldon is led from the warehouse in handcuffs and is barraged with questions from waiting
Flashbulbs go off as they shout out questions
() 57
: #1 Are you officially a member of the Aryan Brotherhood, Sheldon
#2 Is it true you consider Adolph Hitler your personal hero
#3 Do you think associating with neo- Nazis might adversely affect your career
#4 How does it feel to be a hate- filled racist scumbag
This is a mix-up
'm innocent
don't hate anyone
#4 Does that mean you don't hate Nazis
Wait
didn't say that
-- Sheldon is shoved into the back seat of a squad car
It drives off,

: (') Until then, the Smoochy slot will be safely occupied by Popeye cartoons
Thank you
The reporters furiously scribble down his statement
- Randolph dances down the street like Gene Kelly
He whistles a happy tune and tips his hat to everyone who walks by
As he dances along, he pets a dog
Hi there, poochy
Coos at a baby in a stroller
Well, aren't you the cutest little boo-boo in the world
And grabs a rose from a flower vendor before handing it to an old lady
For you, my dear
May you live to be a hundred
He continues to dance onward, waving back at everyone
Unfortunately, he doesn't realize he's heading straight for a light pole and slams into it with a sickening smack
Fuck

Sheldon pops out from a store front
He's wearing a knit cap and sunglasses to disguise himself

Nora keeps walking

: We have nothing to talk about
Don't tell me you believe what they're saying

The picture in the paper said it all
No one forced you to perform at that rally

Well maybe next time you'll do a longer set
Nora,  had no idea that was a Nazi function
None whatsoever
Funny, you'd think the fifty-foot swastika you were standing in front of might've given you a hint
The papers are blowing that out of proportion
It was nowhere near that big
Nora stops and looks Sheldon in the eye
Look, the fact of the matter is, don't know you, okay
Not really
So don't expect me to go out on an emotional limb here
Sheldon looks crushed
But what about the balcony
What about the Klunky-Wunky dance

She looks at him for a moment and then walks off

He's stuffing a cupcake into his mouth and swigging from a bottle of root beer
He passes a construction site and notices some graffiti on a wall -- a crudely-drawn goose-stepping Smoochy in a Nazi uniform and Hitler moustache
Sheldon keeps walking

' On a large screen  the smiling Asian face of Takashi Yamashita, who's singing Cole Porter's " Get a Kick Out of You" in Japanese
to reveal Takashi wearing a white sequined tuxedo with tails as he plays a white grand piano
He looks like an Asian Liberace
He is circled by a group of Japanese children who sing along with him
(
) 'Takashi Sings Tin Pan Alley for Youngsters' is the hottest show on Japanese television
The sweat shops are working overtime trying to keep up with the demand
Record albums, toys, cereal, tee shirts, you name it
'  - Several tough-looking Asian men -- , , and -- Takashi's management group -- sits in Stokes' office
Takashi sits quietly in the corner
Stokes sits behind his desk, sipping his trademark glass of wine
Look, Stokes, let's cut the bullshit
We want Takashi in that Smoochy slot and we're willing to do whatever it takes to get it
Pardon me for saying this, but for a non-resident of this country, you speak impeccable English
'm originally from Teaneck
Ah
We own every hair on this bastard's head and we're willing to share a few strands
if you get my drift
Well, it's not that simple have an executive board to answer to
wish  could just snap my fingers and make a deal but -- () 63
: You mean like this
Chick snaps his fingers and Tobi, the third Asian guy, walks over and drops a duffel bag on Stokes' desk
Oh my
And what is this on my desk
Two hundred grand in a Louis Vuitton duffle bag
Get our boy the slot and we'll round it off to a million
And you can keep the luggage
Stokes stares down at the bundle of opportunity on his desk
You're dealing with an honorable culture, Frank
We know how to play ball
Stokes unzips the bag and gazes at the money
He looks up at Chick and smiles
Gentlemen,  suddenly feel invigorated and full of hope
Chick smiles
'   - On Nora's  screen, we see the black and white image of Rickets the Hippo doing the "Klunky-Wunky Dance
" Nora sits on the couch and stares hypnotically at the screen
There is a  at the door
She gets up and ejects the "Best of Rickets" tape
She opens the door
To her surprise, Randolph is standing there
Hiya, cutie
Before she can respond, he enters the apartment and takes off his jacket
() 64
: So here's the good news: Yes, 'll be happy to end my sabbatical and return to my old slot
know you and Frank are in a bind, so 'll start Monday
Call wardrobe, call props, tell 'em the  man is back and he's ready to start whistlin' dem happy tunes for da little chillens
He flops down on the couch
Ahhh
Who do ya gotta blow to get a Scotch around here
He laughs
You've got three seconds to pry your ass off my couch and get out
Randolph jumps to his feet
Dammit, Nora
The rhino's gone
You need that slot filled and 'm ready to reclaim what's rightfully mine
Just in case you forgot, you're a criminal and a scumbag
Okay, so maybe  commandeered a stray shekel or two
Big deal
Compared to what Smoochy did that's like jerking off in the supermarket
Where do you shop
Randolph walks over and puts his hands on her shoulders
Come on
Have you lost all affection for me
After what we once had
() 65
: That was a long time ago
was young and stupid
Why we broke up 'll never know
You turned into an asshole and didn't love you
We could've worked through all that
He leans in to kiss her and she shoves him away so violently he almost falls over the coffee table
Damn it, Nora
The public is clamoring for me
'm a fucking patriot
Mopes is a Nazi
He's evil
He's probably even gay
You should've seen the way he was checking me out in the car
(suddenly suspicious) What does that mean
What does what mean
You said he was checking you out in the car
What car
No
it's just a vibe
Nazi homosexual vibe
It emanates from the television
The whole Smoochy costume
with the erect horn
mean, what's that all about
Nora starts to walk closer to him
He backs up
You're talking awfully fast, Randolph
still love you
Let's go on a date
() 66
: Were you at that rally
Tell me
Did you have something to do with this
She backs him against the wall and looks him in the eye
Did you set Sheldon up
Randolph just looks at her
You know, now  remember why we broke up
Always with the accusations
Bitch, bitch, bitch
Nora hauls off and punches him in the jaw
' - morose-looking Spinner Dunn sits alone at the end of the bar in the nightclub
Tommy walks over
What's wrong, kid
The mayor of Patterson's here with his wife
They wanna meet ya
don't wanna meet no one
miss Smoochy
He never woulda done the things they say he done
He ain't no Nazi
Someone's making stuff up
just know it, Tommy
Someone's making stuff up
Spinner starts violently pounding his head on the bar, causing  to
want Smoochy back
want to be on  again
want to play my cowbell
Nora enters the restaurant
She looks around and approaches Tommy
Hi, Tommy
Hi, Spinner
Has Burke been in tonight
() 67
: Haven't seen him
Damn it
Something  can help you with
have to talk to him
It's about Sheldon
Spinner lifts his head from the bar
Sheldon
What about Sheldon
'  - Randolph is napping on Angelo's couch with an ice pack on his sore jaw thanks to Nora's fist
There is a sudden at the door
Randolph startles awake
'm trying to sleep, asshole
Read the fucking meter some other time
After a beat, the door is kicked open and Tommy and his crew are standing there
You wanna tell me about the rhino
Hey, this is private property, creep
And you're trespassing
Danny, go give Mr
Smiley a little back rub
Danny advances toward a shaking Randolph, fist clenched and rolling up his sleeve
'  - approaches
He cocks his arm and throws a punch
Danny's fist  the ,    as we hear the

-    - Newspaper trucks pull up to various newsstands and toss out bundles of the morning editions
As each bundle lands on the curb, we see headlines that span over the next few days: - ' : :   "'
" - Randolph, bruised and battered, emerges from the police station with his
and photographers rush forward
#1 How does it feel to be voted the most hated man in America, Randolph
In a country like this, where your average citizen is a fuckin' Neanderthal,  wear it as a badge of honor
#2 What about Ms
Bishop's charge that you have an unhealthy obsession with Sheldon Mopes
Listen,  barely know that broad
She's a wacko
An opportunist
'm the most accused man since Jimmy Hoffa
Someone throws an egg and it hits Randolph in the face
(on verge of tears) That was unfair
Who threw that
That was mean and uncalled for
() 69
: My client is not answering any more questions
Between his dwindling cash flow and mounting legal bills he's sinking into a deep psychotic depression
Please stop antagonizing him
Thank you
He pushes a sullen Randolph through the cluster of people
-   - makeup woman dabs Sheldon's forehead as he's about to go on
Nora stands next to him
is heard from the stage
(to Nora) wouldn't be back here if it wasn't for you
'm just sorry  didn't believe you
that  got swept up in the frenzy of anti-Smoochyism
Well, this town's a house of mirrors sometimes
It's hard to know what you're looking at
He takes a couple of pre-show deep breaths approaches
They're ready for you, Sheldon
Sheldon exits backstage
- The lights in the studio dim
(
) Ladies and gentlemen
boys and girls
(dramatic pause) Who's your favorite rhino
An explosion of enthusiasm from the kids in the bleachers
() 70
: Smoochy
The lights come up as the Smoochyland Band plays a strong, dramatic version of "Battle Hymn of the Republic
" After a moment, Smoochy slowly rises from a lift under the stage
giant sign above the jungle lights up and emits a pyrotechnic shower of sparks
It reads:
beaming Spinner Dunn enthusiastically bangs his cowbell to the music as tears stream down his cheeks
He majestically stands center stage and nods to the kids who are giving him a standing ovation
The song crescendos with a rousing final chorus from the Smoochyland Band who sing, "His truth is marching on
" Thunderous applause from the bleachers
Smoochy walks over to a stool and takes a seat
It's very quiet in the studio now
Smoochy, looking uncharacteristically serious, picks up a microphone as the lights go down
He's in black limbo
Thank you
It's good to be back
You know, kids, sometimes life in the jungle can be unfair
place where nice guys don't just finish last
they get their heads cut off
Gasps from the bleachers
That pretty world you think you know is just props and scenery
Lollipop trees with roots in venom
- watches nervously from offstage
() 71
: So look around you, boys and girls
Every day
Be diligent
Stand strong
As the old proverb says: Beat a dog one time too many and you get a wolf
Let's start howling
Howl for me, boys and girls
The kids in the bleachers howl along with Smoochy
Okay,  just wanted to get that off my chest
Who wants to do the Hokey-Pokey
The kids cheer as the Smoochyland Band launches into the Hokey-Pokey song and Smoochy starts dancing
The kids pour out of the bleachers onto the jungle set
Everyone is dancing and having a ball
Nora is clapping to the music offstage
Sheldon and Nora exchange affectionate glances
'  - Randolph sits in front of the  in a daze
He's wearing a ratty bathrobe and absentmindedly tosses cheese curls onto the floor from a bag on his lap
the , an "Entertainment Tonight"-type show with two perky hosts is covering Smoochy's return to the airwaves
The hosts, Tara and Hunter show Smoochy's dynamic entrance and the standing ovation he got during the taping that day
(
) Well, Smoochy's back and boy did we miss him
Hundreds of well- wishers stood outside Kidnet Studios today hoping to catch a glimpse of their favorite rhino
(
) That's right, Tara
Smoochy's popularity is stronger than ever thanks to his recent exoneration as a Nazi sympathizer
In fact, several movie studios are offering big bucks for a chance to bring the Smoochy story to the silver screen
() 72
: The
Smoochy images flash across the screen
Randolph has been mumbling the whole time
(quietly to himself) Bad
very bad
too much for brain
pressure building
ears ringing
eyes burning
contempt overflowing
He jumps up and kicks the  over
He picks up a lamp and starts beating the
hate you
fucking hate you
You devil-horned mind fucker
Die, die, die
Angelo, who was cooking in the kitchen, runs out
He's wearing an apron
What are you doing
That's a Zenith
(notices cheese curls) Look at this place
He grabs the lamp from Randolph
That's it
want you out of here
(suddenly scared) Where am  supposed to go
don't care
(pointing to door) Out
' - Spinner's massive arms envelope Sheldon in a bear hug, practically lifting him out of his seat
Burke, who's having dinner with Sheldon, holds onto the table before it gets knocked over
Easy, Spinner
Watch the ribs, buddy
() 73
: missed you so much
missed you too, champ
He drops Sheldon and pulls out his cowbell
've been practicing and practicing and  got real good, Sheldon
Real good
He starts banging on it with a butter knife
Sheldon cringes
Wanna see me march
Sure, why not
Spinner starts marching through the restaurant, clanging the cowbell
People who are trying to eat their dinner look annoyed
Sheldon sits back down at his table
So you were saying you had some good news
Yes
Some very good news
After giving it a lot of thought
've decided to do the ice show
Burke gleefully slaps Sheldon on the shoulder
Finally
got me a bar mitzvah boy
Today you are a man
realize now it's a sin to waste your power
Like they say, rock bottom's a college education
() 74
: But here's the really good news: 'm doing it myself
No sponsors, no vendors, no crooks
Not one dirty hand will touch this
Not one person will make a dollar off these kids
Smoochy on Ice will be a study in purity
Burke's grin suddenly fades
As far as food concessions go, 'll supply the refreshments
For free
Low sodium, whole wheat pretzels and apple slices
Healthy stuff
Now are you ready for the best part
'm holding my breath
All profits from ticket sales will be used to built a state-of-the- art methadone clinic in Coney Island
Burke looks pale
'm not just talking a run-of-the- mill clinic
'm going to build a methadone palace
place where men and women can withdraw in luxury
Sheldon, you can't do an ice show and cut out the vendors
And more importantly, you can't cut out the Parade of Hope
It's suicide
You always told me, when you've got muscles you make the rules
Well, 'm feeling pretty strong right now
Sheldon rises and tosses his napkin down
() 75
: All this time  was letting the business use me
Well,  think it's time  start using the business
've got my clout back and 'm not gonna waste it this time
Take care of it, Burke
Sheldon exits
Burke sits there, looking very concerned
On his way out the door, Tommy stops Sheldon
Spinner's continues
Shel, you gotta help me out
He bangs that goddamn thing from morning till night
got a headache that goes from my eyes to my ass
Whatever  can do, Tommy, just say it
You know  love Spinner
And owe you
Give the boy something else to do on the show
Anything
Just as long as it don't clang, chime or honk
'  -       - frightened
There's a gun to his temple
Chick, the Asian representative of Takashi, holds a revolver on Stokes
His cohorts, Sambo and Tobi, stand by
don't like complications, Frank
You got one week to get Takashi that slot or you're gonna be shakin' hands with Buddha
Don't you understand
My hands are tied
The rhino's been exonerated
The show's more popular than ever
() 76
: (to Sambo and Tobi) Okay, boys, chop him up, bag him and dump him in the woods
Sambo and Tobi start to advance on Stokes
All right
'll take care of it
just need time
Chick leans into Stokes' face
One week, Jeeves
Got that
Or get a blender and make an Orange Julius with your feet
They exit
- down-and-out Randolph shuffles along in ratty bedroom slippers
He passes a  who sits behind a small table on the sidewalk
The table has a huge photograph of a rhinoceros taped in front of it
Literature and pamphlets depicting the black rhino are spread out on the table
Save the rhino
Before it's too late
Make a donation
Save the rhino
(to Randolph) Hey, mister, ya wanna help save the rhino
Randolph just looks at him for a moment
He looks at all the rhino-related imagery
He starts shaking and suddenly jumps over the table and attacks the Man
'm the one who needs to be saved
Me
'm broke
lost my lawyer
My only friend kicked me out
'm a fucking peanut shell in the shape of a man
Save the Rainbow
Save the Rainbow
Save the Rainbow
Help
Someone call a cop
Randolph grabs the collection can and runs off
77
- It's a chilly, grey afternoon
Stokes and Burke walk along the lake framed by the New York skyline
Your client is suffocating me
To make matters worse, he's caused me to veer into a hazardous situation
situation that otherwise could have a very happy ending
Tell me more about the Asians
They're ruthless
Unwavering
Unprincipled
And best of all, they know how the game is played
They respect our delicate ecosystem of mutual benefit
Stokes stops walking and grabs Burke's arm
'd bring you in on this, Burke
You'd be my partner on the Takashi deal
Split down the middle
We have an opportunity to get back on track here
Back to the way it was
The good old days
Pre-rhinoceros
The two men look at each other as thoughts pass silently between them
This is very sticky ground we're about to walk on
Well, you're used to a little glue on your shoes
Burke smiles
Let me poke around
Sift through the possibilities
78
-    - slender young man in a Peter Pan costume in being held by a big thug as another thug beats him up
girl dressed as Tinkerbell (also being restrained) looks on in horror
Merv Green (Parade of Hope) steps
This is what happens to guys who keep secrets, Johnny
'll give you the rest next week
promise
It's not me you're fucking over, it's sick kids
You got something against sick kids, Johnny
The thug punches him in the stomach again
No
love sick kids
Merv nods to one of the thugs who releases Peter Pan
He slumps to the ground
Merv kneels down and lifts his head from the pavement
And you tell that fat producer of yours, if he ever gives me a low head count again, he'll lose the other thumb
One of Merv's thugs leans in, whispers something to Merv, who looks up to see
Burke standing in the mouth of the alley
Merv Green
How's tricks, kid
Well, if it ain't smilin' Burke
Whose bones are you pickin' today
(chuckles) You got a minute, pally
79
- Burke and Merv walk along 42nd Street
poster advertises Peter Pan "Sponsored by Parade of Hope -- Giving Children the Gift of Promise
" Merv's thugs trail behind
No one freezes me out of an ice show
No one
don't care how many fucking clinics he's trying to save
Look, 'm chokin' on the same bone as you
If you're trying to aggravate me, you're doing a hell of a job
'm not here to aggravate, just educate
think Mopes might be talking to people he shouldn't be talking to
That's an ugly string of words
He's got it in his head that he's gonna clean up the way we do business
(beat) Truthfully
wouldn't be surprised if he's wearing a wire
Burke looks at his watch
Jesus,  got a thing across town
He steps off the curb to hail a cab
Let's keep talking, Merv
There's oughta be some kind of solution
Don't you think
Burke hops into a cab
Merv watches the cab pull away
80
-    - -      - open
The table is set on the sidewalk
man's legs  the  and shakily climb on top of the table
Randolph stands on the table directly in front of the Kidnet Building
He raises the megaphone to his mouth
Attention, New Yorkers
You are about to hear a shocking story of injustice
Randolph stands on the table directly in front of the Kidnet Building
urge you to listen
It has a surprise ending you won't want to miss
crowd starts to form on the sidewalk
It's the story of a venomous rhino and his aggressive campaign to slander, vilify, defame, denigrate and villainize my good name
But one thing he can't do, is take my life from me
No, friends, only have the power to do that
He reaches down and picks up a can of gasoline
This is what Smoochy has done to me
He's brought me to this can no longer live in a world where the innocent suffer and the wicked thrive
Randolph raises the can over his head and pauses dramatically
Where is God
() 81
: He drenches himself with gasoline
The crowd grows larger
He holds up a pack of matches
'm sorry to do this, people
Don't try to talk me out of it
The crowd starts to applaud
Randolph looks baffled
Do it
Light it
Our guest of honor will be here any moment
This is for his eyes
For his conscience
He'll have to live with this imagine for the rest of his miserable life
- Sheldon sits in the back of a limo on his way to work, reading the paper
The headline blares: " " The subhead reads: "
" (to driver) Take it from me, Lester
Use your power
Don't squander it -- build with it
Sound advice, Mr
Mopes
If ever get any power 'll give that a whirl
(notices crowd up ahead) Hey, what's going on up there
Sheldon glances up from his paper
(casually) Looks like a street performer of some sort
He goes back to his paper
- Randolph sees the Kidnet limo approaching
() 82
: This is it, folks
It's showtime
'm sorry to do this, but he's left me no choice
Randolph tries to light another match, but it's wet from the gasoline
The crowd laughs and starts taunting him
Shut up, you hillbilly assholes
You're borough trash
Go back to your huts across the river
Randolph keeps trying to light the match
Finally, after several attempts, it lights
He holds it up
The crowd burst into applause
Fuck you
Fuck all you people was the last of the Mohicans
You'll never see another Rainbow Randolph in this lifetime
You had me and you blew it
All of you
He turns and faces the approaching limousine
This if for you, Smoochy
Remember this
As long as you live, remember this image
You did this to me
He brings the match closer to his gasoline-soaked body
The limo continues to approach
The crowd taunts him to do it
He tries to bring the match closer, but his hand is shaking
Suddenly, a   pushes through the crowd
Everyone quiets down as she looks up at Randolph
Whatcha doin', Rainbow Randolph
Randolph freezes as he looks down at the Little Girl slight look of hope comes over his face
She smiles sweetly at him, walks over, and blows out the match
Randolph is overcome with emotion
Just then, Sheldon's past him
The crowd cheers
Smoochy
() 83
: They all run away from Randolph and over to Sheldon's limo as it pulls in front of the Kidnet Building
Randolph stares at them blankly
He looks down
The Little Girl is gone
Sheldon gets out of the limo
The crowd cheers him as he waves to them before going inside
look of utter frustration now comes over Randolph
Randolph drops to his knees on the table, looks skyward, and screams
What does it all mean
The    him as he lets out an anguished howl that  through the skyscrapers
-  - - What do you mean  can't play the cowbell no more
Sheldon gently tries to break the news to Spinner who's on the verge of tears
You're too talented for the cowbell, Spinner
Cowbells are for babies
(a little angry) ain't no baby
That's right
You're a fully grown man
With whiskers
and scars
the whole sha-bang
That's why you deserve a bigger role on the show
more important role
Spinner's face starts to perk up
84
- It's the middle of a Smoochy taping
Smoochy and the Gang are wrapping up a song entitled, "My Stepdad's Not Mean (He's Just Adjusting
)" The kids in the bleachers are singing the chorus
'Stepdads are people too/ They have bad days, like we all do/ Be patient and help them through/ Stepdads are people too
' Smoochy continues the song
(singing) 'So three cheers for the man that  proudly call Stan
He's not quite a dad or a brother
Yes, he gets cross, but still he's the boss
And besides he takes care of my mother
' The song ends
The kids in the bleachers applaud
Smoochy addresses them
Remember, kids
First impressions, good or bad, are not always what they seem
Just like a new puppy, new dads need to adjust to their surroundings
So give 'em time
But always remember
if he becomes abusive to you or Mommy
what are the magic numbers
(shouting in unison) Nine-One-One
Right-o-riffic
The Smoochyland Band plays a little fanfare
And now, boys and girls,  have a special surprise
'd like to introduce the newest member of the Magic Jungle
my cousin
Moochy the Rhino
() 85
: The Smoochyland Band plays a happy little song as Spinner Dunn, in costume as Moochy, runs on stage
The Moochy costume is identical to Smoochy only it's a darker orange instead of bright orange
Howdy, Moochy
Welcome to the Jungle
You wanna say howdy to the kids
Spinner freezes
He stares at the camera
Moochy
My name is Moochy
That's right
We've established that
(leaning into Sheldon) Sheldon, this costume's makin' my nuts itch
Sheldon looks horrified
The Smoochyland Band quickly launches into some music
Smoochy, Moochy and a few other jungle animals begin to dance
Moochy's lumbering movements are in stark contrast to the choreographed steps of the others
As a bonus, he occasionally scratches his crotch
'   - happy Spinner (still in costume as Moochy) pokes his head into Sheldon's dressing room
Sheldon, still in costume as well, looks drained after the difficult taping
That was fun
Was it bad when done that thing, where  tripped and knocked over the Flamingo and then he knocked over the cameraman and then those lights fell down on that lady's head
() 86
: It's fine, Spinner
We'll edit it out
But tomorrow in rehearsal we're gonna work on a new thing called 'the importance of hitting your mark
' Great
get to hit something
Spinner dances off
beat later, Nora enters and shuts the door
There's an awkward beat of silence
Hi
Hi
read about the ice show
Yeah, the papers seem to be really covering it
think it's great
What you're doing for that clinic
Thanks
She nods
just need some clarification
Don't worry
Spinner just needs a little more rehearsal
'll get him there
No  mean about us
Sheldon looks uncomfortable
Ever since you've been back  just feel like there's something that's not connecting
() 87
: guess 'm still readjusting a little
Like a guy who's come back from the war
Not that 'd equate my misfortune with the brave men and women who protect us overseas
just thought we were on our way to something
granted, my mistaken belief that you had ties to Neo-Nazis might have put a damper on our relationship, but 'm sorry for -- Sheldon suddenly jumps up and grabs her
He kisses her passionately
Nora immediately starts ripping off his costume as they make out
They fall to the floor in a lustful embrace
-   - Spinner, humming to himself, lumbers down the hallway on his way to the wardrobe room
Halfway down the hall, he hears a voice call out to him
(
) Hey -- rhino
Spinner turns around
The door to the fire exit swings open
Two of Merv's thugs emerge and grab Spinner (who's still in full Moochy costume) and drag him into the stairwell

An enraged Merv Green glares at his henchmen, Henry and How could you hit the wrong rhino

They look fucking identical
Smoochy is bright orange, Moochy is burnt rust
Read the papers
Do  gotta take you back to fucking kindergarten
All you said was 'hit the rhino
' You never specified the color
'm not taking the blame for this one
Merv's anger builds
He turns to a picture of Smoochy which is tacked to a bulletin board along with other kid show personalities that the foundation extorts
Merv picks up a letter opener and violently thrusts it into the picture

Another detective, McCALL, is looking through some papers he found

McCall shows him some scribblings he's found in a notebook of Randolph's

with a knife in his heart

Nora has her arm around him
It's my fault
He'd still be alive if it wasn't for me
He would have been so proud to be in the ice show
There was nothing you could have done
Don't torture yourself
'm sorry, Spinner
'm so sorry
Tommy and the boys walk over
Tommy puts his arm around Sheldon as he gazes somberly at Spinner
He really loved you, Shel
And this  guarantee -- that fucking Randolph has seen his last rainbow
We're gonna find him, cut off his balls, and shove 'em up his ass
Maybe you better leave it to the police
They won't do the ball thing
It's against procedure
Don't forget -- that hit was meant for you, Shel
So from now on, everywhere you go, we go
That's okay, Tommy
'll be fine
Fine, nothin'
And as Christ is my witness, no one's touchin' a hair on your fuckin' head
Spinner would have wanted it that way
Tommy's crew nods and agrees

: (to the boys) Alright, boys, let's get shit- faced
For Spin
They head for the bar
Nora and Sheldon look down at Spinner in silence
Didn't Rickets the Hippo have a song about death
'The Last Nappy Time
' It gave me a lot of comfort when my mother died
(sings quietly) 'When doggies stop barking And fish cease to swim And Grandpa lays silent, from his head to his limbs Sadness will find you But soon you'll feel fine

They embrace as - The news zipper in Times Square glides through the night air: " ' ,

Randolph is talking on a pay phone
We hear Angelo on the other end
didn't do it
know you're still mad at me, but you gotta believe me
() 92
: (
) The papers say you were the mastermind
Mastermind
can barely figure out how to unzip my pants these days
Just taking a piss is a logistical nightmare
(
) believe you, Randy
But you can't come back to my place
They'll find you
You gotta go underground
- We are outside the long-abandoned Liberty Biscuit and Flour factory
The Liberty sign with its Statue of Liberty logo is eroded and partially missing
- Inside the massive dormant factory, rats scurry around and pigeons occasionally fly from window sill to window sill
makeshift living area has been set up in the middle of it all -- a chair, lamp, small table, hot plate, etc
Randolph lays on the dilapidated conveyor belt, huddled under a blanket
Angelo enters the factory through a rusty door, carrying provisions
It's heatin' up out there
Every cop in New York is looking for you
And Tommy Cotter's boys are combin' the streets
You're gonna have to stay put for a while
Randolph sits up on the conveyor belt, blanket draped over his shoulders
He's a physical and emotional wreck
was an altar boy once
Did you know that
wanted to be a priest
Do you believe in angels, Angie
() 93
: Angels
There was a little angel in pigtails
She was the only one who cared about me
She saved my life
Angelo hops up on the conveyor belt to console Randolph
Randolph rests his head on Angelo's shoulder
You didn't want to kill yourself, Randy
You know that
Perhaps it's time to heal
To accept the fact that Smoochy has won and gracefully march forward
True, 'm currently wanted for a murder  didn't commit
But have faith
Faith that justice will prevail
Now you're talkin', kid
This is a big step
'm proud of you
He strokes Randolph's head
Did you bring lunch
Yes
Chicken and stars
Just like you asked for
Can  have some, please
For a smile
Randolph sniffs and manages a small pitiful smile
Angelo musses his hair
Atta boy
() 94
: Angelo lifts one of the grocery bags onto the conveyor belt
Here,  got you some crossword puzzles and stuff to read
Angelo hops off the conveyor belt and turns on the hot plate
He starts to open a can of soup
Randolph reaches into the bag and pulls out a copy of the New York Post
The lead article's headline reads, " "  large photograph shows mourners leaving the restaurant after the wake
Clearly visible are Sheldon and Nora
They have their arms around each other
Randolph's eyes widen
He starts to hyperventilate
Angelo looks up
You okay
Randy
Finally, Randolph expels a blood-curdling scream that through the factory
Motherfucker
Angelo drops the soup
Birds in the factory flutter from the rafters
- Sheldon and the Rhinettes work on some choreography for that night's show
Nora watches from the sidelines
As Sheldon skates on the ice rink, Merv enters with Roy and Danny
Sheldon skates over to them
Nora walks over, too
Big news, Shel
What's that
It wasn't Smiley who killed Spinner
It was Parade of Hope
Merv Green
Are you sure
The cops have tons of evidence on Randolph
() 95
: We did our own investigation
Cousin Ian from down at the morgue
you met him at the wake

' - Tommy is at the bar listening intently to a man, , who is pointing to certain details on a photograph
See the neck
Snapped like a twig
Animals
Parade of Hope's calling card
When they do a guy, they like to sign the tab
What's that guy's name over there
Green
Yeah, Merv Green
This was one time they shoulda left the tab blank
() knew Merv Green was a scumbag from the day he grabbed my ass at a 'Feed the Children' benefit
Well, God help those guys now
They're gonna get a first-class ride through the criminal justice system, and 'm buying the tickets
It's all taken care of, Shel
What does that mean
96
-
- bloodied Merv Green is tied to a chair in the middle of the warehouse as he begs Tommy for his life
Merv's two henchmen lay dead nearby
Roy, Jimmy and Sammy -- Tommy's guys -- stand behind her
It was a mistake
An honest mistake
All 'm trying to do is help children
You like kids, huh
Yes
Of course
So you must know a few fairy tales
Danny, tell him the one about the worthless prick who gets his head chopped off
Danny, holding a hatchet, advances toward Merv
Tommy casually walks away
We   Tommy
Merv is (
) No
no
no
He
We hear the sound of the   its target
Merv's pleading stops
Now you know why charities go under sometimes

don't want to hear this

Okay, got it

: And then we took his head and -- Thank you
Specifics about his head are superfluous at this point
'  - Nora is alone in Stokes' office, rearranging cards on the giant cork board that displays the network schedule
She is startled to hear a deep voice behind her
(
) Where is he
She turns around
Chick, Tobi, and Sambo are standing there
Chick walks over to the cork board
He scans a row of cards that all read "Smoochy
" (attitude) Can  help you with something
Yeah, honey, you can help us with something
He rips a Smoochy index card from the board, walks over to her and waves it in her face
You tell that boss of yours he better take care of the rhino problem
In my culture we honor deals or invite consequences
don't know what you're talking about and your cologne's making me nauseous
Other than that, you're great company
Chick looks at his boys and chuckles
Spicy little thing, isn't she
() 98
: He suddenly pulls out a switchblade and holds it to Nora's throat
Takashi gets that time slot
You hear me, girly
Tell that boss of yours we'll kill everyone at this fucking network if we have to
Starting with the pretty ones
He removes the knife from her throat and hurls it toward the bulletin board
It lands -- sticking right in the middle of a Smoochy card
Auf Wiedersehen, honey
They exit
'  - Nora is pacing
Sheldon sits by the fire
It's Stokes
He's behind the whole thing
He cut some kind of deal for the Smoochy slot
What are you talking about
He wants you out so he can put Takashi in
Who's Takashi
Jesus, Sheldon
Don't you ever pick up a copy of International Performer
He's the hottest kid show host from Asia
Sheldon's head is swimming
Suddenly the front door to to the penthouse bursts open
Randolph, dressed like he's about to do his old show, stumbles in waving a gun
() 99
: Ah
How very cozy
Like two logs in a little bonfire
All we need is a few sticks and some wienies
He almost trips as he stumbles over to Sheldon
He waves the gun in his face
had her before you
Pachyderm
was in love with her
In love
And you snatched her away
Like a common thief
You're the bad guy
Not me
He's the bad guy, Nora
He's incapable of understanding the love we once had
Tender, yet passionate
Old-fashioned, yet experimental
(cackles) Tell him about a few of our experiments, Nora
Tell him
Sheldon looks stunned
Nora hangs her head
(to Nora) Is this true
Please tell me it's just the confused ramblings of a diseased mind
She looks at him, but doesn't say anything
Holy mother of Toledo
When exactly were you planning to let me know about this
(turns to Sheldon) Listen, there was a time -- and 'm not proud of this -- but there was a time when  was a bit of a
kiddie-host groupie
You're just another action figure for her collection
That's not fair
Tell him about Jingle Jackson
() 100
: You dated Jingle Jackson
The bells turned her on
Hey, tell him about Jumbo Johnny
There's a tale for ya
whale of a tale
She looks down, somewhat ashamed
look of utter shock comes over Sheldon
Oh good Lord in Heaven
Look, what  did before  met you is none of your business
Shut up
Both of you
This is my show
He waves the gun threateningly as he backs up to an armchair and sits down
Do you fully understand the power of a condemned man
Do you
'm already wanted for one murder, why should  give a flaming horse's twat if  commit two more
uh
read once that the best way to diffuse a tense situation is with a little humor
To that end, would you like to hear a funny joke
(rolling his eyes) Oh, please
Go blow yourself, Martha
(waves gun again) Fix me a beverage, woman
Make me one of those drinks that used to make us all warm and fuzzy before bouncy-bouncy time
Fix it yourself, asshole
() 101
: (points to gun) Remember,  have Mr
Boomy
'm telling you, you'd love this joke
It revolves around Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny getting into a fender bender
Nora rolls her eyes and goes to the bar
(to Sheldon) You know, when  lived here  used to have a big painting above the fireplace
naked chick holding a pumpkin
It was very tasteful
No bush
Look, Randolph
We know it wasn't you who killed Spinner
We'll go to the police, first thing tomorrow
straighten everything out
Oh
Goody-goody gumdrops
(to Nora) Vodka straight up is fine, sugar babe
He grabs the bottle out of her hand
He rises from the chair
He takes a , " ," from his pocket and puts it into an audio system on the fireplace wall
Did you put on a little weight, honey
That's okay, you're still a hot little brood mare
bet you miss the sweet sting of my riding crop
Giddy up, pony
The   from his show starts to
He flicks a switch and a spotlight goes on
He sings and dances

: (to tune of 'Ol' MacDonald) 'Rainbow Randolph is the man
Yes he, yes he, is
He's the Prez of Rainbowland
Yes he, yes he, is
With some fun, fun here, and a laugh, laugh there
Here a dance, there a song, Everything is fun, fun
Rainbow Randolph is the King, the King of Rainbowland
' Randolph takes another drink from the vodka bottle
Sheldon suddenly lunges at Randolph and tries to grab the gun
Randolph shrieks
The two men wrestle on the floor, but Randolph is not much of a fighter
He screams as Sheldon rolls him toward the fireplace
Is this what you want
Hansel and Gretel ending
You want to be the big bad wolf
Stop
It's too hot
The heat
It's driving me mad
Randolph rolls Sheldon to the bottom
Nora reaches for a fireplace poker and whacks Randolph with it
Randolph cries out and drops the gun
Sheldon grabs it and points it at Randolph who lies on the floor, blubbering like a child
He's bleeding
Go ahead, kill me
Finish me off
My life's over anyway
Everything touch turns to shit
Put me out of my misery
Sheldon slowly takes the gun away from Randolph's head
You're not nothing
You're bitter, misguided and 'm guessing a raging alcoholic, but you're still Rainbow Randolph
Despite everything that's happened, you once made children happy
Randolph sits up and looks at Sheldon through watery eyes
() 103
: Would you be my friend
Sure
(to Nora) You too
guess
Sorry about the brood mare stuff
Randolph throws his arms around Sheldon and cries into his shoulder
Sheldon pats his back
He glances down at Randolph's gun and sees that it's a toy
Nora pours vodka onto a small pillow she's taken from one of the chairs
She kneels next to Randolph and blots the gash on his head with the vodka soaked pillow
Randolph lets out a blood curdling scream
'  -    - being loaded
Sheldon loads his gun as Randolph is curled up on the couch like a little puppy
Nora hands him a cup of tea
(a pitiful child) Thank you
She walks over to Sheldon
(re: gun) What are you doing
Sheldon continues to load the gun
() 104
: Just making the playing field even
'm tired of running this race with one leg
You're letting them drag you down to their level
(from couch) She's right, Sheldon
Don't make the same mistakes  did
Keep your dignity intact
He accidentally spills some hot tea on himself
Son-of-a-bitch
appreciate everyone's concern, but  can take care of myself
Nora and Randolph look at each other
(mouthing to Nora) tried
Sheldon stuffs some extra bullets in his pocket
(to Randolph) Okay, buddy, we have to get down to the Garden
You're welcome to stay here as long as you like
Just don't leave until  get things squared away
Randolph gets up and walks over to him
Be careful, Sheldon
Remember what  told you -- you've only scratched the surface of this scummy business
You have yet to strike oil
Randolph looks at him for a moment before turning to Nora
() 105
: You're lucky to have a guy like Smoochy
You just rest, Randolph
He's the real thing
Smoochy's the real thing
And 've been a fraud
wicked man doing wicked acts
Sheldon slaps the cylinder into place and tucks the gun in his waistband
Well, we all have our bad days
He exits

small Hawaiian string band plays behind her
Burke and a nervous-looking Stokes sit in a booth
Things are getting out of hand
We have to cover our tracks
Relax, everything's gonna work out
Relax
They found Merv Green's head on the Grand Concourse
Excuse my concern
Look, we can cover all the tracks we want, but in the end we still got the same problem
We gotta finish what we started
God help us
Stokes shakily takes a sip of his drink
() 106
: It'll all be over tonight
Buggy's gonna take care of everything
Buggy
Buggy Ding-Dong
The guy who hosted 'Buggy's Bumpy Railroad'
Yeah, until he discovered the joys of Turkish black mule heroin
For the right price he'll do anything
It's amazing the guy's still alive
Stokes buries his head in his hands
don't know, Burke

shadow falls across their table
Burke looks up
Speak of the devil
Have a seat, Bug
Buggy Ding-Dong's hand  the  and snubs out his Camel
Stokes looks up
(attempting to sound cheerful) Buggy
You're looking good
man who looks like he would first kill you then eat you for dinner, slides into the booth next to Stokes
It's time we put this thing to rest, Frank
And the way  see it

Yeah, he lifted my backstage pass and he's braggin' that he's doing some kind of job for Burke Bennett

He suddenly looks very worried

They'll jump on you like a trampoline
don't care
He rips the towel from his head

As far as anyone's concerned, he's just another usher
He heads for the stairwell

After a moment, the Rhinettes skate out to enthusiastic applause

Sheldon, looking very intense, stands alone in the wings
He takes a couple of deep breaths
We   and see the bulge of the revolver under his Smoochy costume
The Rhinettes have formed a line across the middle of the rink
(
) And now
it gives us great pleasure to introduce America's favorite rhino
ladies and gentlemen
boys and girls
(dramatic pause) Heeeeere's Smoochy
Smoochy skates out to thunderous applause
The entire arena is on its feet
The Rhinettes part as Smoochy skates through them and stops in the middle of the rink
The applause and cheering don't stop for several moments
One of the Rhinettes hands Smoochy a microphone
On behalf of myself, the Rhinettes, and the soon to be restored Coney Island Methadone Center,  thank you all for coming
Burke and Stokes roll their eyes
It was my original intention that tonight's performance would be a benign mix of Smoochy songs and ice dancing
But as an artist, believe  must convey to you, my fans, what 'm feeling at any given moment in my life
To do otherwise would be dishonest
Art is communication
It's something we learn and hopefully grow from
With that in mind
hope you enjoy the show

They form a circle around him and slap hands in solidarity

It's Rainbow Randolph
Someone stop him
Randolph finds a side exit and slips into the arena

The soprano continues singing as Smoochy reenacts the incidents of his recent life
The fairy princess brings Smoochy to a room with a gleaming white desk
Smoochy takes a seat behind the desk
The fairy princess places a crown on his head, bids him good-bye, and floats away
Smoochy sits proudly in his new world

: Suddenly, Rhinettes dressed as devils glide in and skate in a circle around the desk
They throw money at Smoochy
He jumps up and skates away, but the Rhinette devils pursue him with daggers
The music from the orchestra intensifies as the drama plays out
Nora continues to watch the opera, totally entranced
Stokes and Burke look a little on edge
Burke glances at his watch
Buggy finishes loading the rifle
He shines the barrel with his sleeve and looks through the scope as Smoochy and company continue to perform below
Atmospheric fog created by the smoke machine is so thick that Buggy has difficulty  Sheldon  the cross-hairs
Occasionally, Smoochy skates through a hole in the clouds only to disappear again
in frustration
Randolph pushes his way past Garden security and runs toward the rink
Several cops working the event spot him
few spectators scream in horror
The soprano's mournful aria reaches its crescendo as Smoochy is now pursued by Rhinettes dressed as Nazis
They hold signs with words like "" and "
" Smoochy skates to a section of the rink resembling Chinatown where he lands over a fallen "Moochy

Randolph runs around the rink's perimeter, trying to get Sheldon's attention
Cops and security push their way towards Randolph
He suddenly notices the felled Rhinette on the ice and looks skyward
He can make out a rifle barrel protruding from the catwalk
Stokes and Burke notice a commotion in the audience
They now see Randolph running through the crowd on his way to the stairwell
() 113
: (whispering to Burke) What's he doing here
He's going to screw everything up
Nora notices the distressed look on their faces and follows their gaze to the rafters
She now sees the rifle barrel
- jumps to her feet
Nora's mouth
(screaming) Sheldon
She starts to climb out of the box but Burke stops her
Nora
You're in on this, aren't you
You sold him out
You fucking snake
Stokes tries to put his arm around her
Nora, please
It's not what you think
'm grooming you
You're going to run the division one day
She pushes him
He goes down hard
She starts to climb out of the box
Burke tries to grab her, but she spins around and punches him
She runs for the rink
Stokes stands in the box looking dumbstruck as pande- monium plays out around him
People are running in all directions, cops are everywhere
(frightened; to Burke) What now
What do we do now
Survival of the fittest
Burke runs off through the panicked crowd
Stokes looks around and heads off in the opposite direction

Tommy and her boys notice the commotion in the audience
They see cops pursuing someone
They realize it's Randolph
Tommy, Jimmy and Sammy take off after him
Buggy, in position again, looks through the rifle scope
As the soprano reaches for an impossibly high note, the fog dissipates slightly and Smoochy's foam rubber head perfectly
smiles
' Nora screams
Sheldon
Get down

Randolph reaches the catwalk as the orchestra plays a dramatic series of smashing notes
He tackles Buggy just as he squeezes off the
The top of Smoochy's foam rubber head is blown off
In , Smoochy's tattered horn sails through the air and lands softly on the ice
Everyone in the arena screams and heads for the exits
It's pandemonium
Thanks to Randolph, Buggy's shot was too high and just missed Sheldon's skull
() 115
: confused Sheldon bends over to pick up a chunk of the Smoochy head
Nora, who's entered at the opposite end of the rink, tries to reach him, but it's impossible
Panicked audience members run across the rink, heading for the exits
It's chaos
People slip, Rhinettes get trampled
Randolph tries to get the rifle away from Buggy
They struggle on a narrow beam high above the rink
The cops have reached the outer edge of the catwalk now
Tommy and the boys get there a second later
They all stand back -- the catwalk is too unstable
Give me that gun, you fucking wacked-out freak
Buggy manages to shove Randolph off him
He raises the and  at the cops
Randolph grabs him
Both he and Buggy lose their footing and slip from the catwalk
Randolph is able to grab onto the edge and hold on
Buggy clutches Randolph's leg which threatens to bring them both down
They dangle 80 feet above the rink
Randolph desperately tries to hold onto the catwalk as Buggy clings to Randolph's ankle
' His knuckles turn white as his fingers start to slip from the beam
Still clutching Randolph's ankle, he starts to lose his grip
He desperately grabs Randolph's foot, but Randolph's shoe slips off and Buggy begins his long plunge to the next life
- Buggy screams the whole way down, still holding onto Randolph's shoe
Buggy crashes into the middle of the rink, cob-webbing the ice around him
116
Tommy and his boys runs off to find Sheldon
The help Randolph off the catwalk
He's a nervous wreck
#1 You okay
don't know
'm kind of fucked up in general, so it's hard to gauge
They pat the dazed Randolph on the back
He passes out
People continue to run through the rink
Felled Rhinettes litter the ice like broken dolls
Smoke fills the air
Sheldon is helping a random woman to her feet as Nora finally reaches him
She embraces him
Burke's with Stokes
He's been in it all along
Sheldon looks toward the network box
Beyond it, through the smoke, he sees Burke shoving his way through people who jam the exit trying to escape
Sheldon reaches into his costume and pulls out his gun
No, Sheldon, don't
Sheldon runs off leaving Nora
Burke is almost through the cluster of people
He glances over his shoulder and sees Sheldon heading toward him
He shoves even harder now and finally gets through
- Burke makes a run for it down 33rd Street
moment later, Sheldon emerges from the building
He sees Burke in the distance and takes off after him
He's still in his skates and wearing the partially-blown-off Smoochy head
117
Burke looks behind and sees the nightmarish image of a disfigured Smoochy chasing after him
He quickly rounds the corner
few moments later Sheldon rounds the corner
He looks down the street and sees no sign of Burke
He notices an alley by an abandoned building
- Sheldon walks slowly into the alley, gun drawn
Suddenly, Burke jumps out from behind some boxes
He whacks Sheldon's head with a garbage can lid
The gun goes flying
Burke goes for it, but Sheldon is quickly on his feet and pounces on him
The two men fight it out
Burke manages to get on top of Sheldon and starts to strangle him
You fucking point a gun at me gun  gave you as a gift
Where's your fucking etiquette
Just as Sheldon begins to lose consciousness, we hear a Burke looks up
Nora stands there, pointing Sheldon's gun directly at him
Let him go
Burke just looks at her
Now
Before  pump one in that Grecian Formula scalp of yours
Burke smirks as he releases Sheldon
Sheldon jumps up and takes the gun from Nora
He shakily points it at Burke
You know something, kid
You've turned out to be an incredible pain in the ass
Burke slowly stands up, brushing off his suit
You were behind the Spinner hit, weren't you
() 118
: That was a tragic mistake
(shakes head sadly) If only one could turn back time
(beat) But what the hell, it's just one less mick in the world
He laughs
You son-of-a-bitch
Sheldon cocks the gun
Oh my
What are you gonna do
Kill me
That wouldn't be very Smoochy-like behavior
You're right
There's just one thing
Sheldon tears off the remains of his tattered costume and steps out of it
'm not Smoochy
Sheldon is shaking as he extends the gun to Burke's head
finally realized we're living in a different jungle
Burke suddenly looks fearful, as does Nora
No, Sheldon
Sheldon closes his eyes as he tries to summon up the courage to pull the trigger
Sheldon
Suddenly, there's a voice from behind
(
) Don't do it, Shel
Sheldon turns around
It's Tommy and her boys
() 119
: (sternly) Stay out of it, Tommy
This is my business
Tommy walks closer to Sheldon
No more killin', Shel
Enough's enough
Don't destroy who you are for this piece of shit
You mean something to the kids
Don't take Smoochy away from the kids
Tommy extends her hand for the gun
Sheldon looks down at the gun
He can't believe he's even holding it
He hands it to Tommy
don't know how  got pushed this far
You're only human, Shel
The important thing is
you never went over the cliff
You're a good boy
For some of us
it's too late
Tommy pats Sheldon's shoulder affectionately
We'll take it from here, kid, you run along with your girl
Get on with your life
Sheldon looks over at Burke, who's petrified
Tommy, you're not going to -- Don't worry
Sometimes even a rat deserves a little mercy
Sheldon and Nora take a final look at Burke before walking out of the alley
Burke is wide-eyed with fear as Tommy's boys advance on him
Just as they round the corner there is the sound of
Sheldon looks at Nora
Bus backfire
She pats him on the back
120
- Stokes finally makes it out of the arena
He runs toward his waiting limo and hops in the back seat
He barks to his driver through the glass partition
Get out of here
The car doesn't move
Stokes pounds on the partition
Move this thing
No response
Stokes frantically pushes the button that lowers the partition
It slides down
Are you deaf
said -- The driver turns around
Stokes recoils in horror
It's Takashi
He smiles as the back doors open and the Japanese thugs -- Chick, Sambo and Tobi -- pile in with Stokes
They slam the doors shut
wish  could tell you it'll be quick and painless, Frank, but you know how these things go
Stokes lets out a small whimper
Chick nods to Takashi who steps on the gas as he sings "Anything Goes" in Japanese
- The car heads into the night, passing Sheldon and Nora, who have exited the alley
This will be Frank Stokes' final limo ride
- Sheldon and Nora pause on the street
Sheldon looks around him
You know, a little grime here and there doesn't change the fact
it's still a beautiful city
He looks at Nora
() 121
: Let's go home, Smoochy
Show's over
Sheldon gazes back at her
No it's not
It's just beginning
