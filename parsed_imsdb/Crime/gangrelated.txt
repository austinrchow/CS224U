" " Written by Jim Kouf 1997 : -    - The  and the  are not working
So it reads the   motel
, ,
The Prince Motel has passed its prime
few beat up cars are parked outside rooms
We   to
Curtains closed, but someone is holding it open a crack, looking out
We in     and the  looking over the parking lot
Then the curtain closes
-   - Peeling flowered wallpaper, ultra-cheap furniture
The man moving away from the window is
He is slender, sports a thin mustache, hair slicked straight back
He's in his late thirties
Slightly nervous
Another man sits on the couch, looking at a magazine
He is forty, solidly built
His name is
Says here they got slips in Honolulu
325 a month
Utilities included
That's not bad
Rodriguez sits down
But  gotta get at least a forty footer
It'll handle rough water better and 'll need the room if 'm gonna live on it
Rodriguez stands up, moves back to the window
Divinci looks up
don't know how you do it
What
How you can think about Hawaii now
My heart's in Hawaii
You never been there
How can your heart be there
You're tellin' me there's no place you'd rather be other than here
No, 'm saying  just don't know how you can think about Hawaii right now
If  was in Hawaii right now, wouldn't be thinking about here
See the difference
No
Look, 'm not in Hawaii, 'm here
But  don't want to be here,  want to be in Hawaii
can't be in Hawaii, therefore  think about it so as to not get depressed about being here
But 'm here,  know 'm here, don't like being here, but  can't be anyplace else because  look around and  see all this shit
How do you get around that
That's what 'm asking
Focus
Focus
Divinci nods
Rodriguez looks at his watch
It's time
No more Hawaii, okay
Focus on this
(smiles) Aloha
Rodriguez shakes his head, exasperated, and exits
(to himself) Aloha my ass
: - Poor side of town
few old cars parked on the street
Some buildings vacant
cruises past
We
- drives
Hudd is thirty
African American
The is loud
His clothes lean to African roots sits next to the passenger window
Her name is
Cynthia is thirty-five, dressed in short provocative skirt, tight top
little too much make-up
She's lead a hard life
She glances at Hudd
Hudd glances at her, looks down at her skirt hiked up on her leg
Left at the corner
Hudd's eyes linger on her thighs for a moment, then he turns his attention back to driving, tapping along with the heavy bass
- The Cadillac pulls into the parking lot
Parks in front of room
Hudd gets out, looks around
Cynthia gets out, leads him to
Knocks
The curtains pull back
Divinci looks at Hudd and Cynthia
She nods to him
The door unlocks and opens
Cynthia enters
Hudd looks around again
Then follows
- Divinci waits at the door
He and Hudd eye each other as Hudd enters the room
Divinci looks out, making sure no one has followed, then shuts the door
Hope you don't mind me checkin' you for weapons
Hell yes  mind
Divinci hesitates
This could break the deal
just don't want no man handlin' me
Hudd looks at Cynthia
The suggestion is taken
Okay
Check him
Hudd spreads his legs, lifts his arms
Cynthia would rather not have the job, but there's no choice
Lotta good hidin' places on this body
Check good
Cynthia runs her hands over Hudd, checking pockets, pants, sleeves
Finally coming to his crotch
Hudd smiles
Careful
It's loaded
Cynthia has heard it all before
She's not squeamish in the least and she gives him a good going over
He's got nothin'
She smiles back at Hudd
Then moves away, sits on the couch and seductively crosses her legs
Divinci, satisfied, pulls a   packed tight with out of his pocket, tosses it to Hudd
Hudd sits on the couch, opens the bag, sticks his finger in and tastes the contents
But never takes his eyes off Divinci
Not bad, not bad
Any more where this came from
Maybe
Then maybe we talk again
Maybe
Hudd stands, unzips his pants
Reaches in to grab his cock, but instead, pulls out a stack of
Inch thick
Told you there was a lotta good hidin' places on this body
Hudd hands the money to Divinci and pockets the plastic bag
Then crosses to the door
Glances back at Cynthia
Bet you gotta lotta nice hidin' places, too
Then Hudd smiles and exits
- Hudd gets into his Cadillac, pulls out of the motel parking lot
- Deserted
No one on the street this late
Several of the buildings are boarded up
- Hudd drives
No music this time
His attitude has changed
More serious
in the
Coming up fast
Hudd watches as the car pulls around to pass
He glances at the  as it pulls past him, but all we is the
Front
swerves into a parked car
The   -- a   -- screeches to a stop next to it
gets out
Moving quickly to the Cadillac
It's dark, difficult to see
He carries a
44
Opens the door
He's wearing Hudd is dead, slumped against the passenger door
The man reaches in, turns off the engine, grabs the plastic bag of cocaine
And now we see it's Divinci
- Rodriguez is the driver
Anxious
Engine running
Come on
Hurry up
Divinci dashes back to the Buick, hops in
Rodriguez floors it
tears off down the dark street
: - Not a great part of the city
Apartment buildings line both sides of the street
An alley runs between two of the buildings
pulls up in front
on a passed out in the street
Cynthia exits the taxi
The taxi pulls away
She glances at the man passed out in the street
His clothes are ragged
He's filthy
His face covered in beard and greasy dirty hair
Hard to tell how old he is
Maybe forty
Maybe eighty
Who knows
His hand clutches a bottle in a bag
Hey, Joe, wake up
Get outa the street before you get run over
Joe, wake up
She nudges him with her foot
The man groans, rolls back
Dead drunk
You're in the street, Joe
Get outa the street
The man, , is silent for a moment, then he starts to crawl -- toward the middle of the street
Other way, Joe
Joe turns his crawl toward the curb
Cynthia watches him for a moment
He is truly pathetic
Forget it, Joe
Maybe you're better off right there
don't think you'd even feel it
Cynthia enters the building next to the alley
: -
- asleep
The room is dark
We  a door open and close
Cynthia wakes
Who is it
Divinci crosses to the bed
Got your money
Put it on the table
She closes her eyes, trying to go back to sleep
Tired
Yes
'm not
Take a sleeping pill
There's some in my purse
You want your money
Cynthia's eyes open and she looks up at Divinci
He's smiling, holding up
already worked for that
Divinci unzips his pants
This is a bonus
For who
Divinci smiles
Cynthia snatches the money
Divinci starts to undress
This ain't my fault
This is a failure of our educational system
If you hadn't fallen through the cracks and dropped outa school, you wouldn't be here now
So what's your excuse
'm in love
Cynthia just stares at him for a long beat
Then she unbuckles Divinci's pants
: -     - door is pushed open
Rodriguez enters his one bedroom apartment
Starts to shut the door when   appear from the shadows
The first is short, well dressed
His name is The second is large, heavy-set, shaved head
His name is
Cutless Supreme is not a man to be messed with
Keepin' some late hours
Rodriguez looks at Cutless Supreme
What the hell you doin'
What're my neighbors gonna think
apologize
understand your concerns
But you must understand that, unlike a bank,  cannot rely on a late fee as sufficient encouragement to repay one's debts
am forced to employ the likes of Mr
Cutless Supreme, whom  might add, contributes significantly to my overhead
am the real loser here
And  am concerned about your sincerity in repaying the twenty- seven thousand, nine hundred forty- two dollar gambling debt that is one week past due
What can you do to reassure me of your good intentions
can make your life fuckin' miserable that's what  can do
Look at me
Do  have a wife and three kids
Do  have a good job at Am  a handsome guy
No, no and no
loan money at excessively high interest rates to pricks like you who can't control their urges to lose big money playing cards and then  am forced to stay up all night trying to convince them that  have needs, too
The point of which is, already have a fuckin' miserable life
So don't threaten me you lousy bag of cat shit
Rodriguez steps toward Vic, but Cutless Supreme slides in between them
Rodriguez isn't going to win this one
All 'm askin' is that you be responsible
Is that unreasonable
Rodriguez backs off, hesitates as he runs over his options
There aren't any
He reaches into his pocket, pulls out some of his night's earnings
Four thousand is all  got
am proportionally reassured
You purchased yourself an extension
Vic takes the money, heads for the street
Rodriguez watches Vic walk away
Cutless Supreme watches Rodriguez
Cutless Supreme, what kind of fuckin' idiot name is that
It was the car my daddy stole to take my momma to the hospital, but the cops stopped him and shot him dead in an alley before he could explain
was born in the back seat
Rodriguez glares at Cutless Supreme, then he shuts the door
: - -- Dead drug dealers lying where they were shot
Overlapping - of   and filled with  from hundreds of crime scenes
And - of   -- chalk outlines -- bullet shells - bloody foot prints
And finally
The    fades back into  -- surrounding the
We  , revealing controlling the area
It's early morning
have stopped to watch
But this is not a high traffic area
pulls up
Unmarked
Two men get out
We as they approach the Cadillac and , who knows them
Another day, another body
Where you wanna start
hit
Looks like
Could be gang related
And now we     from the unmarked car
It's and
Suit and ties
They act like they own the area
And they do
Happened sometime last night, early morning, two, three o'clock
African- American male, looks like in his thirties
But even that's a guess
Half his head is on the upholstery
Any witnesses
Oh, sure, hundreds
- The bloody scene is untouched
Hudd's body is where it fell, on the seat
Dried blood everywhere
Divinci looks in
Fuckin' Animals
: - Behind a locked fenced in area checks in and out all evidence
He is twenty-eight, wears glasses, very clean cut
are checking in evidence as Divinci walks in
three shotgun shells, twelve gauge
The Desk Officer checks in the evidence
Three shotgun shells, twelve gauge
The two detectives wave hellos to Divinci as he approaches
(
) Heard you got a gang related
Lucky guy, Divinci
You get all the pretty ones
One less drug store on the street
And the world is a safer place
The Desk Officer buzzes Divinci through the door
Divinci crosses to the -- -- filled with shelves
Stacked with evidence from on-going investigations
And the shelves are full of guns, knives, bloody gloves, masks, shoes, etc
Divinci looks around, then removes the and the
44 from his pockets and places them back on one of the shelves
-549087
One thing about the
44 which we can see now -- a   on the metal of the handle
: - Desks, phones, computers, typewriters and
Some witnesses being interviewed
Rodriguez is on the phone at his desk
He's in the middle of an interview as he fills out one of the many forms that complicate his life
(into phone) -- a green car
you know what make
Maybe a Ford, uh-huh
You didn't see the license, did you
Divinci comes back to his desk, next to Rodriguez
Rodriguez looks up
Divinci gives him a confident smile and brushes his hands together -- clean hands
(into phone) Yeah, no,  understand, it was dark
Uh-huh
Divinci sits at his desk
He pulls an  for a 42 out of his desk
He holds it up to Rodriguez, points to the boat
Wanna go for a ride
(into phone) You think you could describe the driver
(covers phone; to Divinci) You bought it
As of last night, 've got the down
Just picture me under swayin' palms with a Mai Tai
We can  someone describing a felon over the phone, but Rodriguez isn't listening
He's looking at the boat
(into phone) Uh-huh
(covers phone) You're gonna buy it, no shit
When
Just a phone call away
Divinci picks up the phone, starts to dial
That's really great, man
Divinci smiles
Rodriguez suddenly realizes the person on the other end of the phone has stopped talking
(back to phone) Uh-huh, okay
how tall was he
heavy set man in his fifties approaches -- You got primary on the drug related this morning on 27th
'm workin' it up now
Who's your second
(Divinci points at Rodriguez) In my office
Both of you
Why
Now
Captain Henderson doesn't wait for a response
He heads for the office -- an inner office of glass and wood
Divinci looks at Rodriguez, who is suddenly a little nervous
We can  the     that he's talking to, but he's no longer interested and hangs up on them
What the hell -- Divinci motions "keep calm
" '  - Henderson is hanging up his coat as Divinci and Rodriguez enter
They aren't the only ones in the office
, thirty-two, trim, short cut hair, suit, is waiting
Detectives Divinci and Rodriguez, this is Richard Simms
He's with the He wants to ask you some questions about your case
What's the occasion
You get an i
d
on the victim
We're waitin' for prints
Divinci pulls out his note pad
Car was registered to -- -- Anchor Imports
81 El Dorado
Black
If you got all this, what d'you want from us
The man in the car is Lionel Hudd
(a little incensed) How d'you know that
(to Henderson) What's goin' on here
Hudd was , undercover
Rodriguez and Divinci take the news like a sledgehammer
On their frozen expressions we  -- (
) He was workin' a case on syndicate distribution of drugs on the south side
But every dealer we tagged kept getting killed
He finally got a lead on a girl -- Hudd was a friend of mine
'm gonna nail the sonuvabitch who killed him
long beat on Rodriguez and Divinci, then -- We'll do everything we can to help
: -
- screeching around a corner and up a drive into a
The car skids to a stop and Rodriguez gets out of the driver's side, slamming the door and storming off
He's out of his mind
Divinci gets out quickly, follows him
Rodriguez is so fired up and scared he can't stop moving
, , ,
Calm down
' , '
, ,
Divinci catches Rodriguez, tries to stop him from flailing about
,  , , ,    ' Rodriguez tries to push Divinci away, but Divinci holds on
They struggle -- -- pushing, shoving, falling to the dirt
Divinci jumps on top of him, pulling his pistol and shoving it into Rodriguez mouth
Shut up and listen to me
Rodriguez glares up at Divinci
They could be watchin' us right now you asshole
So fuckin' shape up
You got it
(nothing from Rodriguez) want you to nod
It takes Rodriguez a moment, but he nods
Divinci pulls his gun out of Rodriguez' mouth, gets off him and holsters his pistol
Rodriguez is scared to death, not of Divinci, of the mess they're in
He just lies in the dirt
Get the fuck up
Rodriguez starts to get to his feet
Divinci grabs him, yanks him up
Pushes him to the car
Get in the car
They move back to the car
Rodriguez gets back into the driver's seat
Divinci moves around to the passenger side
Gets in, slams the door shut
- They sit silently in the car for a moment in the middle of the vacant lot
Breathing hard
Dirty
After a beat -- There's no fuckin' reason to panic
Rodriguez turns slowly and looks at Divinci incredulously
No fuckin' reason to panic
Did you say no fuckin' reason to panic
Stop being an idiot
We're the cops on the case
It's our case
We are going to find the fuckin' killers
'  '
Since when does that matter
Rodriguez stares at Divinci for a beat, then we -- : -  - Rodriguez and Divinci are sitting on the car, each with a beer and sharing a bottle of whiskey
All they want is someone to go down for the crime, right
Do we care who goes down for the crime
Fuck no
As long as someone goes down for the crime
It's a slot that's gotta be filled
Rodriguez is calmer, but still something bothers him -- We killed a cop, doesn't that bother you
Of course it bothers me
What d'you want me to do, turn myself in
Well 'm not
That's the risk we take everyday, somebody might pop us, especially undercover like that
So he got popped
It happens
Not by other cops
patted him down
He wasn't wearin' a wire, he had no badge, no gun, how was  supposed to know
moment of silence, then -- Look,  feel just as bad as you do, but we gotta start thinkin' about us here
The important thing is we don't lose control of the case
We can never lose control of the case
Whatever evidence there is goes through us
We lay down the trail
Make it nice and logical
We're the teachers and two and two can add up to five if it's our classroom
What're you talkin' about, are you sayin' we stick somebody with this
Evidence points wherever we want it to point
Shit, we can provide so much evidence, even the asshole we pick will think he fuckin' killed him
You got some asshole in mind
Just don't worry
We'll find a killer
There's lots of 'em out there
: - , all in their twenties, are hanging on a street corner
Talking
Normal street traffic
They give a long hard look to an who walks past
little chatter
The   suddenly screeches to the curb
The black youths scatter quickly as Divinci jumps out and goes after the tallest of the three
His name is
Rodriguez guns the car and gives chase on wheels
James darts across traffic
Divinci running hard after him
Rodriguez spins the car in a u-turn
Racing after them
- James darts down the alley
Narrow, dark, lined with trash bins
Divinci turns into the alley, but he isn't going to catch him
James is almost to the end when the car turns into the alley, skidding to a stop
Rodriguez jumps out, gun leveled at James
No where for him to go
He slows down
Rodriguez moves in from his front, Divinci runs up from behind
James is disgusted
What the hell'd  do now
: -    - Divinci removes the    and the
44 from the shelf
-549087
: 44 -
- across a table to James, who stops it with his right hand
Divinci and Rodriguez are across from him
Ain't my gun
Never is, is it
That ain't my fuckin' gun
He shoves the gun back
Divinci stops it with his arm, careful not to touch it
Got your fuckin' prints on it
James quickly realizes what they've done
He lunges for the gun, but Divinci picks it up quickly with a pencil through the trigger guard
James glares at them with murderous intent
Where were you Friday night
Friday night
last Friday night
Where were you
Whatever you think  did went down last Friday night
Better have a good alibi, James, or it's good ali bye-bye
beat, then James smiles
was in jail you assholes
Check it out
(starts to laugh) All night
What a couple a dickheads
Rodriguez and Divinci are silent
: -
- on a grungy small apartment
Divinci and Rodriguez burst in, guns drawn
Scaring the shit out of an () and his half-naked  as they watch television
: 44 -   - across the table back to Rodriguez and Divinci
Cortez sits across from them
Wearing white t-shirt, baggy pants
Tattoos on his arms
Ain't my gun
(smiles) Got your prints on it
(stands; angry) You fuck,  ain't never seen that gun before
Where were you last Friday night
Fuck you
wanna talk to a lawyer
Just want they wanted to hear
No alibi
Lawyer's not gonna help you, Cortez
All the evidence we got points right to you
Cortez stares at them for a moment, then -- Did you say last Friday night
Cortez smiles and pulls up his shirt, revealing a long scar across his stomach
Intensive Care, you pindejo fuckin' gutter shits
And Thursday night, and Saturday, too
just fucking got out this morning
: -
- , hitting hard, falling back to the dirty garbage covered alley
He's about twenty-seven, thin, blond hair tied in a pony tail
He wears a flannel shirt, jeans, boots
He doesn't want to fight
His name is
Alright, alright, alright
shit ain't gonna fight you
He looks up at Divinci and Rodriguez moving toward him
: - Dave is behind the desk handling the
44 with no apparent problem
Ain't my gun
That's what they all say
Wish it was
No better gun than Smitty and Wes
44 mag with serial numbers filed off
(opens cylinder) Got any bullets
Divinci walks around, holds out his hand for the gun
Who did  kill
Where were you last Friday night
You mean, what's my alibi right
Dave spits on the gun, wipes off his prints with his shirt
was breakin' and entering
Jewelry store on seventh and Front, about nine o'clock
Not even close to your jurisdiction
got the rocks to prove it
He drops the gun, clean of prints onto the table
Sorry  can't help ya
But one to five is better than ten to life
Divinci and Rodriguez stare at Dave
They are not happy
: -
- in plastic pages
full of criminal portraits
Divinci is going through one book
Rodriguez searches another
Montrose LaJolla
We pulled him in last year for knifing that dealer on 32nd
Yeah
Almost killed him, remember
He'd be good
(calls out to ) Anybody seen Montrose LaJolla
He's dead
His life partner killed him in a Domestic  about a month ago
Rodriguez suddenly slams his book shut
Shit
Divinci looks at him
Rodriguez is angry, tense
Divinci gives him a look telling him this is not the time and place for a discussion on this topic
Take it easy
This isn't gonna work
Divinci leans toward Rodriguez
Nobody said it was gonna be easy
But let's not advertise our despair
Okay
The
Divinci picks it up
(into phone) Divinci
'  - Captain Henderson is sitting behind his desk
Divinci and Rodriguez are in front of him
Rodriguez is trying to hide his nervousness
Divinci is absolutely cool
This is our case
Not the goddamn 's
It's been three days
We're not fuckin' magicians
What the hell is three days
This is a goddamn murder case
It takes a little bit of goddamn time
When a Federal Undercover Officer goes down, it's never a fuckin' murder case
don't like the  on my ass any better than you like 'em on yours
But this is personal for them and they want answers
Forget your other cases and get something, anything that  can give to them
The last thing  want is the goddamn
on my back, too
Divinci and Rodriguez are quiet for a beat, then -- We've got a couple leads
We need a little more time
can't hold 'em off much longer
This is no fuckin' way to run an investigation
Let me tell you both something, if you don't solve this quick, they're gonna start askin' why
And they'll be lookin' to blame somebody in this department
So my advise to you is, get something fuckin' fast or turn over what you've got and get outa the way
Rodriguez and Divinci are quiet for a moment, then -- How much time we got
couple days
The funeral's this afternoon
What funeral
For Agent Hudd
Simms wants you there
What for
We didn't know him
How the hell do  know
It's , it's their thing
You're the cops on the case,  suppose they want you to know what a great guy Hudd was so you'll work all that harder to find his killer
Just go
It'll reassure 'em how much you care and keep 'em off my ass
: -   - gathered around the grave site
in tears in tears
The men trying their best to hold up
Beyond the family,
Simms among them
show of support and solidarity
delivering -- -- and it is too easy to say that he was a good man in his job because he gave more than most
And it's too easy to say that he was a good man in his community because he gave more than others
And it's too easy to say he was a good man at home with his family because he was always there when they needed him
Special Agent Lionel Hudd was not just a good man, he was an extraordinary man
And his death shall not be in vain
Divinci and Rodriguez at the back
Rodriguez looks nervous
Divinci notices
Their conversation is quiet
Don't Humpty Dumpty on me
What's that mean
Your cracks are startin' to show
(covering) Bullshit
Divinci sees Simms approaching from the side
Get your balance
Here comes the King
Rodriguez glances toward Simms as he walks up
The conversation is quiet
Not wanting to disturb the ceremony
Glad you came
Anything break
Divinci glances at Rodriguez
Nothin' to brag about
But we've got a couple new leads we're followin'
Look, normally we'd be all over this, but your Captain seems to think you can do the job
It's your territory
guess you know it better than anybody
And that can be worth a lot
But you understand
we won't wait forever
Divinci is pissed
He doesn't like Simms
Just outa curiosity
What happened to his backup
You guys use backup on undercover don't you
It was a new lead
Hudd was afraid backup would blow his cover
He was supposed to check in ten minutes after the deal went down
He never checked in
We want this one as bad as you do cop's a cop
We're in this together, right
Simms stares at Rodriguez and Divinci for a moment, then he returns his attention to the ceremony
That's why  asked you to come here
Just so you knew that
: - Rodriguez and Divinci walk down the street, hot dogs in hand, returning to their car parked curbside
He didn't have backup
You believe that
Jesus what a dick
don't think we should criticize that particular decision of his
don't care what the reasons are, you don't play Lone Fuckin' Ranger on a drug buy
You're just askin' for it
That's all 'm sayin'
don't trust those bastards
They're not waitin' for us
That's bullshit
They're runnin' their own investigation
know it
Let 'em
The gun, the coke came from evidence
The car came from impound
So what's to find
That's what 'm afraid of
There's nothing for them to find
We were too good
So what're you worried about
Nobody is that fuckin' good
Divinci looks at Rodriguez, then smiles
Except us
: -
- bumping and grinding her way through her performance
We don't see her face yet
Just her body
-string and skin tight tank top
in the audience appreciative
The room is smoky
swirl over the stage
The tank top comes off
and
And now we see the dancer -- it's
-   - Cynthia moves down the hall in her g-string and high heels
She enters the dressing room
- Divinci is sitting in the only chair in the cramped little room
He's going through her purse
Cynthia stops when she sees him, then shuts the door
think this is breaking and entering, isn't it
work homicide,  don't deal with that shit
(puts on robe) Learn anything you didn't already have on file
Yeah
You surprise me sometimes
Here  think you're just a hard case and  discover you've got a heart of gold
(holds up her drivers license) You're an organ donor
That's really nice
The only problem is, they'll never use your best parts
'll make sure you get them
Hey, don't get me wrong
was just surprised that we had something in common
Besides what we have in common
Do everybody a favor, if you're gonna donate your heart, make sure it goes to science
Most people want one that beats
Cynthia
pretty name
What do the first three letters spell
Don't get so clever
It's out of character
: '  -  - Divinci and Cynthia are lying in bed
Divinci has his arm around her, but he's staring at the ceiling
What's so interesting up there
Nothing
Then why's it got all your attention
'm thinkin', that's all
About us
No
Good
Divinci looks at Cynthia
What if  was thinkin' about us
Don't waste your time
What if  was
Where's it gonna get us
Maybe  got plans
don't wanna hear 'em
Plans just make you think somethin's gonna get better
'm fine now
don't need to get screwed up waitin' for something good to happen
just want you to know, love is important to me
Me, too
But more important is loyalty
Nothing is more important than that
Not love, not anything
Because loyalty is about respect
You can talk about love all you want, but without respect it's empty
mean the first thing that goes in a marriage is respect
And once it's gone, forget the love
So  am telling you,  am loyal to you
Like 'm loyal to my partner
We are closer than blood
And  trust him with my life
Cynthia didn't really expect this from Divinci
She's actually, despite herself, a little touched
Why're you telling me this
When you asked if  was thinkin' about us and  said  wasn't,  just want you to know that  do
beat, then -- Just don't ask me to marry you
(smiles) Why aren't more women like you
Divinci leans in and they kiss
: '  - Divinci exits the building
Starts to cross the street to his car parked on the opposite side when he him
He turns, instantly reaching for his pistol
drunk staggers out of the alley -- looks like he has a gun in his hand
Divinci instinctively raises his gun to shoot when -- -- catches the object in the drunk's hand -- a , the neck sticking ahead like the barrel of a gun
(lowers gun) You fuckin' idiot
The drunk stops when he hears the voice
Looks through his matted greasy hair that cascades in front of his eyes
Now we recognize Joe
Divinci turns away, disgusted
Opens his car door, then stops
Caught in a thought
He turns back and looks at Joe again
- Joe stumbles back into the
Lies down next to a trash bin
suddenly illuminate Joe
Joe squints as a  moves right up to him
Joe shields the light with an arm
We  the   and , then Divinci bends down into the
He is wearing a   backwards on his head
And  on his hands
He reaches inside Joe's What've we got here
He pulls out the Smith and Wesson
44
Divinci looks at Joe
Where were you last Friday night
Confused, Joe looks up at Divinci through matted hair
: -  -  ( ) Divinci drives
Joe up front
In an alcoholic daze
' What's your name
Joe looks at Divinci
Having trouble focusing
Your name, what's your name
Joe
Where'd you get the gun, Joe
Joe looks down at his hands -- he's holding the
44
It was in your pocket, Joe, your coat pocket
You must keep it for protection, right
don't know
Sure you do, Joe
Everybody needs protection
Especially a guy like you lives on the street, right
Joe just stares at the gun
Put it back in your pocket, Joe
You don't have to worry about me, 'm not gonna hurt you
Joe puts the gun into his jacket pocket
: - The  of '
The street is empty
Quiet
Divinci stops his car next to where Hudd died
'  - Joe is asleep, leaning against the window
Divinci reaches across and yanks him
Wake up, Joe
want you to look at something
Out the window, Joe
Look out the window
Joe's eyes open
Divinci forces his head to the window
This is where it happened, Joe want you to remember it
This is where you killed him Joe tries to turn to Divinci, but Divinci holds his head
You remember it now
How you shot him through the head
You remember it
don't
(lets go of Joe) You will
Divinci slams his foot down on the accelerator and -- -- tears off down the street
: -
- asleep
Alone in a double bed
The
Rodriguez startles awake
Catches the phone on the second ring
Who the hell is this
-
- Divinci on the phone in the f
g
Joe is passed out on the bed in the b
g
The room is dark
Is that any way to answer the phone
Divinci, shit
It's quarter to six
know what time it is, 'm not the one in bed
need the photos of the scene
Now
got a suspect
But he can't remember all the details
He needs a little help
And  thought, since you're my partner, you might jump at the opportunity to lend me a fuckin' hand
Rodriguez sits up in bed
He doesn't remember last Friday
He doesn't remember a lotta Fridays
Bring the shots and pick up a fifth of Vodka
(glances at Joe) Make it two
: -
- asleep on the bed
Time to get up, Joe
Divinci slaps him
Joe's eyes open
want you to look at something
The room is still dark
Curtains drawn
We now see Rodriguez
He's wearing a black sock cap and gloves
He hands Divinci of the car, the street, the victim -- the murder scene
Divinci pulls Joe into a sitting position
There's the guy and the street and the car
You remember how you shot him
Joe stares at the photographs and starts to shake his head
You don't remember
That's not what you told me last night
Joe is confused
If you remember you can have a drink
Joe looks at the bottle Rodriguez holds out to him
But you gotta remember how you saw him driving toward you and you were in the street and you were afraid he was going to hit you so you had to shoot to protect yourself
You remember now don't you
Joe stares at the photographs for a moment, then nods
And where's your gun, Joe, where do you keep your gun
Joe thinks a moment, then reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out the
44
Divinci hands Joe the bottle and Joe drinks
We   on the    as the liquid drains away and we    until we can   ' as we -- : - Hudd dead
Blood on the windows
The street
Joe is drunk again
In a haze
Starts to lift the bottle
Rodriguez pulls it away
Rodriguez and Divinci always stay behind Joe
Why'd you kill him
don't know
It was your gun
don't have a gun
Yes you do
In your pocket
'm tired
know, Joe, it's tough to remember things you don't wanna remember
What about your last name, Joe
You got a last name
Joe looks up as if trying to remember
Or trying not to
Come on, Joe, everybody's got a last name
don't remember
Don't fuck with us, Joe
We're trying to help you
What's your last goddamn name
Joe shakes his head
don't know
Rodriguez suddenly smacks Joe on the side of the head when he tries to look back
Joe is surprised by the blow
Divinci pushes Rodriguez back
Shakes his head telling him to back off
(to Joe; friendly) Come on, we're all tired here, Joe
Just give us your last name
don't remember
Okay, fine, what's in a name
But you remember the gun, right, in your pocket
Joe nods
And you remember that you told me you thought he was going to hit you, right
That's why you shot
Yeah
Divinci looks at Rodriguez
Rodriguez nods
How'd it happen, Joe, tell me how it happened
(prompting) You saw him driving toward you -- --  saw him driving toward me -- : -  - driving
The night that he was shot
He looks ahead into the darkness of the street
Suddenly he  -- - standing in the street ahead of him
-
- smiles and turns toward the man in the street
44 is pulled from a jacket pocket, lifted toward the The gun is in the hands of Joe
He is scared
The He aims and  the gun
And the car swerves to the curb
- Joe watches from the street, then looks at the
44 in his hand
- Rodriguez leans into Joe who is now sitting on the edge of the bed, looking down at the
44 in his hand
Then what did you do
- Joe is in the street again
He doesn't know what he did
Divinci leans close to Joe from behind now
You ran
And now Joe can imagine it
We   '
as Joe turns and runs
As fast as he can away from the death
He looks back over his shoulder, scared
' didn't mean to
Joe is staring at the gun
Divinci and Rodriguez watch him
He was going to hit me
was scared
he was going to hit me
Rodriguez looks at Divinci
That's why you shot him
That's why
-     - the gun again at the
' shot him
And we  the   , shattering the silence as we -- : 44 -
- held by Joe's hand, which is held by Divinci's gloved hand
Divinci has held Joe's finger on the trigger and pulled it
The gunshot is deadened in the old building
Joe is lying in the back seat of a car, passed out, with Divinci holding the 44 in his hand
The back door is open
The engine is running
Helluva nice shot, Joe
Divinci pulls the 44
out of Joe's hand, then shuts the door, gets into the front
The car pulls away, exiting the warehouse
-
-   - signing a name at the bottom of a paper -- Joe
Beneath it is the type written name:
We   and see it's Joe signing a typewritten page as Divinci and Rodriguez watch
Joe is a mess
When he finishes he pushes the paper away and puts his head down on the table
Divinci picks up the paper and we -- : '   - small yellow Toyota with a bashed up left fender pulls to the curb
Cynthia gets out lugging her purse and a bag of groceries
We
She turns
Divinci is walking across the street from his car toward her
It's the middle of the day
Divinci gives her a look as he takes the grocery bag from her
Just talk
Since when
Divinci leads the way into the apartment building
'  - Cynthia opens the door, pulls the key out of the lock as Divinci enters behind her with the groceries
need you to do something
Good,  need the money
She shuts the door
Divinci deposits the bag on the table
Cynthia picks it up, moves into the kitchen
This isn't a deal
Where you goin'
got perishables, okay
Cynthia enters the kitchen and Divinci follows
Cynthia starts unloading the groceries, putting the milk, eggs, etc
into the refrigerator
The guy we did the last deal with is dead
Cynthia turns suddenly
What
Somebody popped him that night, probably when he tried to unload the stuff
don't know
Jesus, does anybody -- -- Don't worry, there's no connection
We got the guy who did it
Cynthia breathes a sigh of relief
You scared the hell outa me
We just need you to do one thing
What
: - Divinci and Rodriguez are moving down a hallway with Cynthia
She's nervous
Wants very much not to be here
He'll be third from the left
Don't fuck up
Third from the left
What'm  supposed to say
Just look at 'em and then look at the man the third from the left and say, It's him
And 'll say, Are you sure
And you say, Absolutely
No question
This is all  need to do right
We have a signed confession
You i

The others squint from the bright lights
Lift your heads, look straight
Heads are lifted
Eyes front
But we only recognize one of them, standing third from the left
It's Joe
Divinci, Rodriguez and Cynthia are in the gallery
Take your time
Try and remember his face
Cynthia counts three from the left and
wait a minute
She looks more closely
Just to be sure
Rodriguez and Divinci watch her
She's obviously putting on a good show
Then she turns to Divinci, sitting next to her and whispers -- know him
Divinci is caught a little of guard -- he didn't expect a private conversation, nor does he want one for fear of it looking like he's coaching her
If you can identify the man -- (whisper) know him
Just tell us which one
Cynthia, frustrated, gives Divinci a look
No
fucking know him
Divinci still isn't sure what's gotten into her
Rodriguez looks over, a little annoyed
What's the problem
There's no problem
(to Cynthia; pointedly) Do you see him up there
(aside) You don't understand
Divinci is losing his patience
He doesn't want to blow the whole thing now, not in front of guards and police personnel
The Guards are beginning to wonder what the hell's going on
So are the  in the line
Hey, come on, do it or don't
No talking
Divinci leans in close to her
We can   from the men on the platform
Pick the asshole out
Cynthia starts to protest again, but she suddenly feels Divinci's hand grip her arm
He's had enough
Cynthia gets the message
And while keeping her eyes locked on Divinci she says -- Third man from the left
squints against the harsh light, trying to see into the room, as if he recognized the voice
: -   -     - Rodriguez, Divinci and Cynthia move briskly down the hall
None happy about what just happened
The conversation is strained
You mind telling me what that was all about
know him
He hangs around my building
He lives in the alley or something
Rodriguez looks at Divinci
Is this a problem
You don't think people that hang around your neighborhood can kill somebody
Well let me tell you something
You don't live in a great fuckin' neighborhood
Divinci pulls a paper from his pocket
Just sign the goddamn paper
What paper
You picked a man out of a lineup, you have to sign that you did that so they don't think we made it up
Cynthia just stares at Rodriguez for a beat, then -- Now why the hell would they think something like that
Sign it
You said all  had to do was pick him out
This is part of it
Just sign it and you're done
How come you're so sure it was him
Rodriguez rolls his eyes
Jesus Christ
He confessed
Bullshit
We got it in writing
He didn't do it
How the hell d'you know that
Were you with him at the time
You have a good goddamn alibi for him
Maybe she was blowing him
Better him than you
Rodriguez grabs her arm and pushes her against the wall
Divinci looks around quickly to see who's watching
Take it easy
Rodriguez angrily throws up his hands and glares at Divinci
Fine,  got nothin' at stake here
Divinci gives him a look, then leans right up next to Cynthia
This is what they call an open and shut case
He did the kill and he's going down
Don't make the mistake of thinking you know the right thing to do
Divinci holds out the paper
Cynthia hesitates a beat, then takes it and signs her name

Simms looks across at Rodriguez and Divinci
Capt
Henderson and     ( and ) are also present
The  are in suits and ties
He wouldn't give us his last name
He signed a confession but he wouldn't give you his last name
He said he couldn't remember it
(points to his head) He's a head case
You run prints
No priors
Ballistics match
We're waiting
But a forty-four was used in commission
He had a forty- four on him
It went down pretty quick
It's our street
think they did a helluva job
Suddenly Simms slams his hand down on the desk
Goddammit
Everyone turns to Simms
He's angry
Rodriguez is uneasy
Some goddamn piece a shit blows him away for
The intensity of Simms anger quiets everybody
beat as Simms regains his composure
'm sorry
Hudd was too good for this to happen
just didn't think he'd go down this way
Simms crosses the room to Divinci and Rodriguez
Good work
Thanks
He shakes their hands
Then exits
Hooper and Sarkasian follow their boss out the door
Rodriguez, Divinci and Henderson exchange a look

The liquid disappears

He carries a briefcase
Short hair and a beard and wire-rimmed glasses
His name is

(no response) Word is he signed a confession
Word is everyone's entitled to a defense
no matter how guilty they are
They stop at the cell block door
The guard unlocks the door
we can see Joe on the floor in fetal position
Shaking from lack of alcohol
Oh shit
: - Elliot waits in the hall
Fingers impatiently drumming his briefcase
The door opens and a  exits the room
He's detoxing
gave him something to help him through it
Can  talk to him
The doctor nods, opens the door
Elliot enters
- Basic first aid station
Joe is on a table
Eyes closed
Elliot walks up
Doctor behind him
Joe, can you hear me
Joe's eyes open
'm Elliot Goff
'm your attorney
Do you understand what 'm saying
Joe's eyes close
Leaving Elliot in the dark
: - Court is in session
Old metropolitan courthouse
The and his  are at one table
The and his  are at the other
The Prosecutor is a woman
Her name is
She is thirty-nine
She wears a business suit
is her second in command
Richard is thirty-three
The   is fifty and a little on the portly side
His name is
But it's the  that really attracts our attention
His name is
He's done his best to look like a law abiding citizen, but no matter what kind of clothes he wears or how he slicks down his long hair or trims his mustache, this sonuvabitch looks like he'd kill for a nickel
He's on trial for murder
In the first
What a surprise
We are in the midst of opening statements
And Helen is keeping the  riveted
The presiding Judge is a , -- when the defendant, Clyde Dunner, entered the house of George and Carol Beaman on Friday night, a
44 caliber pistol in his hand
He entered the house with one thing in mind
To kill George and Carol, the people he blamed for the break up of his marriage to Carol's sister, Paula
The defendant is hardly listening
His attention is on the prosecution table
And he turns to glare at them
The two men are   and Clyde glares at them as if he'd like to get up right now, walk over to them and cut off their heads
Actually, that's what he's thinking
He mouths "You die
" Divinci mouths back
"Fuck you, prick, asshole, dickhead
" Then he smiles
Clyde boils
George and Carol were watching a movie when he entered the living room and opened fire
George was killed instantly, hit in the face
Carol died later of three bullet wounds to her chest
John Oblinger, his attorney, catches Clyde's murderous look and instructs him, with a point of his hand, to pay attention to Helen
Clyde reluctantly turns his gaze from Divinci
Then the defendant, in his effort to cover up the crime, doused them with lighter fluid and set the house on fire
Carol was still alive
, looking very upset, enters the courtroom, shows i
d
to a , then makes his way down the aisle
He tries his best to be quiet, not to interrupt Helen's statement
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury we will prove to you, beyond any reasonable doubt, that the defendant, Clyde David Dunner, is guilty of two counts of murder in the first degree
Helen looks at the jury for a beat, then returns to her table
The defense may now proceed
John Oblinger stands to present his side of the case
But our attention stays with Helen as she approaches the table to find her team in an upset
Their conversation is a tense whisper
-- Jesus Christ
--  don't know where
Are you sure
They looked all over -- What's wrong
They can't find the murder weapon
What're you talking about
Dunner's
44
They can't find the goddamn gun
They lost it or something
Misplaced it,  don't know
They can't find it anywhere
(no whisper this time) What
pause in the court
The judge taps his gavel in anger as we -- : '  - Rodriguez, Divinci, Richard Stein, the young man and Helen
Helen is furious
--  don't have a goddamn case without the goddamn gun
His fingerprints, the ballistics, everything
have to have the fucking gun or he's gonna walk
That murdering piece of filth will go free without the
44
How could they lose it
Rodriguez and Divinci exchange a look
: -
- walking quickly down the steps
The Dunner gun, you used the fucking Dunner gun
This is not my fuck up
Our shooting was supposed to be gang-related and unsolved
Only because we tagged a goddamn undercover cop do we need the fucking
44 for evidence
Otherwise, we never woulda needed it
So don't point your finger at me
Alright, alright
But how are we supposed to explain how the same gun was used in two murder cases by two different killers when it was supposed to be in police custody
We don't explain it
It's not our fault they lost the evidence
Ballistics are already complete in Dunner's case
All we need is another gun
: -  - as it opens, revealing a  different
All my merchandise is in top condition
Untraceable
The best money can buy
in a three piece suit, picks up the
44 with a His accent is British
It's got good knock down, but it's slow
Unless you have a preference for revolvers,  suggest a nine millimeter auto
They are more expensive, but what they cost in money, they save in time
Rodriguez and Divinci look down at the gun
The
44
The gun seller eyes them for a moment
What
You look like police
Divinci and Rodriguez stare at the gun seller
Then he smiles
No offense
: - as the
44 goes onto the shelf
-549087
: -   - Elliot is waiting, sitting at a table, staring at papers in his open briefcase
Door opens and a  leads Joe into the room
Joe looks better, for the first time
His hair is combed
And he's clean
He wears jail blues
But he is a little gaunt
And tired
Elliot stands
The guard shuts the door, leaving them alone
Joe, 'm Elliot, we met the other
well, you weren't in very good shape
You look much better
Joe just stares at Elliot
Have a chair
We need to talk
About what  did
Yes
Joe crosses to the table and takes a chair opposite Elliot
Joe, before we get into what happened that night, 'd like to check a couple of things first
(looks at papers) Joe is your first name,  assume Joseph
Okay
Okay
Not the answer Elliot was looking for
What about Doe
Is that what you told the officers your last name was
don't think so
What did you tell them your last name was
don't remember
Well, is Doe your last name
'm not sure
Elliot stares at Joe
This is going to be a little more difficult than he thought
Do you know what your last name is
don't remember
Joe, 'm your attorney, 'm here to help you
It doesn't matter if you give the court your last name or not, they will still put you on trial
Do you understand
Yes
So there's no reason to try and hide your identity
(Joe nods) What is your last name
would tell you if  could remember
Joe Smith, Joe Jones, Joe DiMaggio
Elliot hopes he can trigger a response
Joe tries hard
don't think so
Okay
Look, we'll move on
You understand the charges against you
They're serious
And if you are found guilty, you could go to prison for a very long time
Maybe  should
What
Go to prison
killed him
didn't mean to
But he was going to hit me
Yes,  know,  read your confession
Joe, if you really felt your life was in danger, we might be able to use self-defense as our argument
But before we get into that
Do you have any family, Joe
Any friends
don't think so
Joe
do you know what a psychiatrist is
Yes
Have you ever seen a psychiatrist
'm not sure
Joe, you don't remember much about yourself
No
but you remember the night you shot the man in the car
Yes
Why
because
can
'm sorry, 'm not much help
Elliot stares at Joe, then looks down at the blank page in front of him
: - The trial of Clyde
Dunner in progress
Prosecution team at their table
Defense team at their table at the bench
Divinci on the stand
Clyde glaring at him
And Jury listening to Helen on the floor, prosecuting with vigor
-- and when you approached the suspect in his apartment, did you identify yourself as a police officer
Yes
Did the suspect respond
Yes, he did
In what way
He started shooting through the door
The Defendant fired six times, until his gun was empty
We would like to show you the weapon he used
Helen crosses to the prosecution table, picks up the
44
She holds it up for the jury to see
And we would like to enter it into court records
It was the same Smith and Wesson revolver he used to viciously murder George and Carol Beaman
The
44 is duly entered into the records
glances at "his"
44 as it passes into the '
It's a
44 all right
The prosecution would like to call Mr
Steven
Allen to the stand
Steven
Allen
, a short balding bespectacled man in his fifties, crosses to the witness box where he is sworn in, then sits
Mr
Allen, would tell the court what you do
am a lab technician for the police department
One of my duties is to examine weapons used in violent crimes
Clyde's attention is on Helen's
He's bored by the proceedings, but something suddenly strikes him
He looks at -- 44 -- on the evidence table
There is no   on the handle
tested the defendant's revolver and matched the bullets fired to the bullets removed from the deceased
That ain't my gun
All attention turns to Clyde
His attorney, the judge, the jury, Helen, everybody is surprised by the sudden statement
must remind the defendant that he is not to speak out when -- That ain't my gun
The Judge taps her gavel
John Oblinger puts a hand on Clyde's arm
Clyde pulls it away
And now things happen very fast
'  '
And Clyde is moving toward the gun
And the Bailiff and are moving toward Clyde
And Helen is moving out of the way
And the Judge is standing, banging her gavel
And the jury is scared
' '  '
Clyde grabs for the gun as the bailiff and guards grab for Clyde
Clyde turns and decks the bailiff and all hell breaks lose
'  '
: '  - Door slams open
Rodriguez and Divinci enter
Rodriguez quickly checks all the stalls as Divinci closes the door
They are alone
When Rodriguez finishes with the stalls -- We gotta put the right gun back
We can't put the right gun back
Without that gun, they won't convict Joe
Without that gun they won't convict Clyde
'm not worried about Clyde, 'm worried about us
Look, Joe's never goin' to trial, right
He signed a goddamn confession
Like you said, this one is open and shut
Clyde's the one we gotta worry about
We can't let him go back on the street
He's a fuckin' psychopath
He'll kill somebody again
Shit
How the hell did that piece of puke know it wasn't his fuckin' gun
don't think he knows his own fuckin' mother, but he knows his fuckin' gun
don't think that's important right now
: - The harried Desk Officer is filling out his usual paper work when Divinci and Rodriguez approach
Divinci knocks on the door
The desk officer looks up
He's had a tough day
Sorry, Divinci, can't do it
What d'you mean you can't do it gotta check something
You gotta get written permission from the Chief
Since when
Since an hour ago when he came down here and chewed me a new asshole bigger than a three car garage
What's the problem
Something about missing evidence or who the hell knows
just wanna transfer the hell outa here
What the hell're we supposed to do
Ask the chief
Policy ain't my department
: - Joe's preliminary trial
Joe is seated at the defense table with Elliot
,   , is behind the bench
No jury
This is a preliminary hearing to determine if there's enough evidence for Joe to stand trail
Elliot is shuffling papers in preparation for his opening
And at the prosecution table is a very tired Helen
She looks completely pissed off and worn out
In no mood for anything to go wrong
Whenever you're ready
Elliot stands
We would like to plead not guilty to the charge of murder at this time for reason of Insanity
Helen gives Elliot a look
She doesn't need this
But  did it
Elliot turns to Joe
Yes, Joe
Let me handle this
But  signed the confession
Yes, Joe
Don't worry about it
'm the attorney
Your honor, can we have a moment
Council may approach the bench
Helen and Elliot cross to the bench
Your honor, my colleague's client admits to the killing
don't see any reason to go through a trial when it's obvious he would like to plead guilty
don't agree
If he wants to plead guilty, you have to let him plead guilty
Not if he's not of sound mind
Come on, Elliot
think he's crazy
know you think he's just putting it on, that's
standard procedure, but  don't think he is
So, your honor, 'm standing by the not guilty because  believe he's incapable of making that judgment
Have you had a psychiatrist look at him
Yes, your honor
(hands him papers) think you'll see that my diagnosis is not without warrant
The judge hesitates, then looks at Joe
Joe is staring at him
'll review the findings and make my decision tomorrow
Thank you, your honor
(to Helen) Besides,  hear there's a good chance of beating the charges for lack of evidence
Helen's look turns icy
: / - Dark, smoky
Not a place for the health-conscious
Rodriguez and Divinci at a corner booth
Both with scotch and waters
Nobody can connect us to the evidence thing
we're clean there
Rodriguez is quiet
The most important one is this mess anyway
Once that's finished, we're completely in the clear
You know we can't do it anymore
yeah,  guess
No, we're through
That's it
Good while it lasted though
hundred grand apiece
Not bad for a few nights work
Divinci lifts his glass in a toast to himself, drinks
just wanna get through this
We're gonna get through it
No evidence problems on this one
hope not
don't know, Frank, lately  been thinkin'
maybe what we did wasn't such a good idea
Hey, we took out a few scumbags, that's it
Nobody's ever gonna miss those shitheels
They were all pieces of garbage
Not one of 'em had a sheet less than a mile long
Drugs, extortion, assault
They were all fuckin' guilty as hell and still on the street, you know that
Except the cop
Yeah, except the cop
That's part of the job
Could just as easily have happened to you or me
But we're cops, you know
We fucked up
We fucked up once
Once outa ten
That's not bad
(a beat) 'm sorry, okay
'm sorry
He was in the wrong place at the wrong time, what can  say
'm not goin' down for it
know
Look, if we got paid a decent salary we wouldn't be tempted by this, right
And what happens when we retire
You think our pension's gonna take care of us
Shit no
We are on our own mean all  want in life is a goddamn fishing boat, a beach, a couple drinks and some Hawaiian fuckin' music
That ain't much for twenty years putting murdering assholes behind bars
mean, the dealers, the pimps, the killers, they got no rules
We got all the fuckin' rules
It ain't fair
That's all 'm sayin', it ain't fair
For awhile, we made it fair
Rodriguez downs his scotch
Quit thinkin' you're a bad guy
You're not a fuckin' bad guy
You made one mistake
Let it go
Rodriguez nods
comes to the table
Rodriguez orders another
The Waitress leaves
Rodriguez hesitates a moment, then -- Do you think we're corrupt
Hey,  never took a fuckin' bribe in my life
Me either
Nobody ever bought me
know
No fuckin' way
Even the thought makes me sick
And what we did has nothing to do with being corrupt
It's two completely different things
Don't get 'em confused
guess you're right
'm telling you
It's nothin' to do with corrupt
'm worried, that's all
Hey, you gotta worry a little
It's natural
Just don't lose your sense of humor
My sense of humor, right
The problem with people is, nobody gives a shit about makin' the world a better place
You and me,  don't care what anybody says, we made the world a better place
No matter what happens
There are ten less drug dealin' assholes on the street today because of us
They're not plea bargainin' their way back onto the street, they're not clogging up the courts, and they're not costing the tax payers a fuckin' penny because they're not in prison
They were garbage
And there's nothin' wrong with takin' out the garbage
Divinci downs his scotch
Rodriguez nods, then -- So, you think you'll get back with Caroline
Shit
Nothin'  ever do is good enough, you know
Never is, never was, never will be
Guess  gotta make the effort
It's gonna cost me if  don't
Tell me about it
You know how much got left
You're gonna think 'm an idiot, but
like Cynthia
There's no bullshit with her
just fuckin' like her
think you just like fuckin' her
Rodriguez smiles
Divinci looks at him for a beat, then -- Yeah, that, too

'  - with '  on the front page
: We   to Cynthia, sitting in her kitchen, staring at the photograph
What the hell, Joe, at least you won't get run over
She folds up the paper and throws it in the trash can
: - The Dunner trial
The  is back
Helen, Judge Weinberg, Clyde
Dunner (who now sports a couple bandages to his head), his attorney John Oblinger -- they're all waiting for the verdict
The defendant will stand and face the jury
Clyde stands
What is your verdict
We find the defendant, Clyde David Dunner, not guilty
Helen closes her eyes in defeat
Clyde smiles
Fuckin'
: - Divinci is on the phone
-- when was the last time you saw him
-- Uh-huh -- And you haven't seen him since then
Rodriguez suddenly strides up
He looks panicked
We gotta talk
(into phone) Just a second
(covers phone) Calm down
heard
Clyde walked
No
(leans in close) They're takin' Joe to trial
Divinci stares at Rodriguez for a beat, the reality of his statement taking a moment to fully slam home
They found him mentally unable to plead so his attorney pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity
You gotta be kiddin' me
Yeah, that's me,  love to make people laugh
You hear the one about the two cops who popped the undercover : - Cynthia on stage, in the middle of her routine
Hoots and whistles from the all
But she's not really into her performance tonight
She pulls off the last of her clothing to  and
- Cynthia enters
An   in sweat shirt and jeans is sitting in the room
Who the hell're you and what the fuck are you doing in here
(calls down hall) , , (to the man) suggest you get out before Bob gets here
He doesn't like assholes
You're Cynthia Webb
(calls down hall) The Asian Man stands
But you are Cynthia Webb the famous dancer, yes
Yeah, yeah, nice try, get out
The man moves toward her, pulling a  from his pocket
He hands it to her
liked your show very much
What the hell's this
He exits
No answer
Cynthia stares at the paper -- subpoena
For what
didn't do anything
But the man is gone
, a  , tears past, giving chase
(staring at paper) Oh shit
oh shit
He served me
He fuckin' served me
: - Dark, quiet
hand picks up the phone
' Hello
' Detective Divinci
Yeah
' This is Sergeant Gardner down at the station
-
- The station is alive with activity
Even at this early hour
, , ,
Some being booked, some being released, some being obnoxious
Sorry to call so late, but  got a hysterical woman here says she needs to talk to you about a murder
Divinci turns on the light revealing a  in bed with him
He picks up his watch, looks at the time
told her  couldn't call you at home, but she said that it was very important
matter of, you know, life and death
What's her name
Cynthia
Divinci perks up at the name
And now we  Cynthia in the   trying not to look as freaked out as she feels
But she's not holding together well
Tell her to wait, 'll be right down
Divinci hangs up
Starts to dress
The woman groans
What the hell're you doing
gotta go down to the station
Now
What time is it
Go back to sleep
Frank, this is no way to repair our marriage, you know
She pulls the covers over her head
Divinci pulls on his pants
: - 3:38
Divinci pushes into the room
Sees Cynthia sitting on the bench, looking nervous as hell
Smoking, tapping her foot, looking around
Just this side of a wreck
Hey
Cynthia sees him and is immediately on her feet, moving to him
Frank,  can't do this
He came to the club
You gotta -- Not here
He takes her arm, leads her out of the station
- Divinci leads Cynthia out of the station to his car
thought you said all  had to do was pick him out
That's what you said, that's all  had to do
did what you said
But that was supposed to be all
He opens the driver's door, pushes her in
Gets in behind her
- Cynthia is a bundle of nerves
Divinci slams the door
Cynthia is startled by the suddenness of his anger
What're you talkin' about
Cynthia opens her purse and pulls out the subpoena
They want me in court
Divinci glances at the papers
You promised me  wasn't gonna have to do anything
What the hell is goin' on
This is yet another glitch that Divinci hadn't counted on
can't do this, Frank
can't go into court
'm gettin' outa here
You are not getting outa here
Well  can't go to court
' '
'
' Cynthia glares at him, then turns away, takes a drag and blows out the smoke
Fine
Think away
Divinci hesitates as   pulls out
Then turns to her
Look, you're a witness, that's all
You got nothin' to worry about
You saw something happen -- -- What
What did  see
will tell you everything you gotta know
You understand
Everything
You will know exactly what to say
Cynthia looks at Divinci, unsure
Divinci gives her a confident smile
Look, it's another stage, that's all
Just like dancin'
pulls quickly out of the
: -   - Elliot is waiting
The guard opens the door and Joe enters
Joe is looking better
Getting him off booze has helped immensely
Hi, Joe
You're looking much better
guess jail's been good for me
Elliot nods, motions for Joe to take a chair
Trial date's been set for Thursday
've been thinking about what  did
and  don't think it's right that try getting off
Excuse me
want to plead guilty
killed a man and  should be punished
'm a little surprised
Why
Nobody ever wants to be punished for what they've done
It's just a new concept
But  still think our defense is reasonable
don't believe, under the condition you were in, that you were responsible for your actions
But why was  carrying a gun
had no right to carry a gun
If you hadn't been carrying the gun, you might be dead
And he might be alive
understand
Can  think about this
No
've made up my mind
Elliot stares at Joe for a beat, then we -- : -
- lying in the street
have the area under control
few   have stopped to watch
An   pulls up
Stops
- Parked
Rodriguez behind the wheel
Divinci next to him
What if she takes off
Then we got no goddamn witness puts him at the scene
And what happens if she testifies and nobody fuckin' believes her
Perjury, maybe
But that's a fifty fifty
They might believe her
Shit, Frank, she's a goddamn stripper for Chrissake, who's gonna believe her
don't believe her when she's telling the truth
An  walks to the car and knocks on the window
Divinci rolls it down
What
Ahh, we got two bodies out here and three more in the house
So
was just wondering if you were gonna be the primary on this one, that's all
Yeah, yeah, we're comin'
Just give us some room
Divinci rolls the window back up
The officer backs off
She could blow the whole thing
She could tie us in and that would be it
We'd be fuckin' fried
If it looks like she's gonna crumble we'll take steps
What steps
Divinci looks at Rodriguez
One more chalk outline more or less in this city who's gonna know
Oh shit, Frank
Hey, hey, you think  like this
We just can't go around killin' everybody
Just a second
Look around
Whatta we got here
Two stiffs on the street, shot to shit, three more inside
That's five chalk lines in one night in one deal in one neighborhood in one city
Let me fill you in on some statistics, we're not killin' everybody
(a beat, then --) Look, this is strictly last resort
Okay
But let's not kid ourselves
If push comes to shove, somebody has to go down
If you got another candidate, 'm willin' to listen
Rodriguez is silent
Divinci opens the door
Rodriguez watches him, then he follows
To the scene of another crime
: '  - Cynthia is in the kitchen, making herself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich as she watches Sally Jesse Raphael interview yet another moron on television
The phone rings
She takes a bite of the sandwich as she picks up and mumbles -- Hello
-
'  - Richard Stein, the attorney, is on the phone
His office is cluttered with the myriad of case files he's forced to juggle
Cynthia Webb
(swallows) yeah
'm Richard Stein with the District Attorney's office
You're a witness in a case we're handling and 'd like to talk to you as soon as possible
Cynthia puts down the sandwich, her appetite suddenly gone
Ms Webb
Yeah
Any chance we could get together today
(nervous) 'm ah
pretty busy
It won't take long
Will you be home about two
(no answer) Ms Webb
Yeah, okay

Good
Let me make sure 've got your correct address

The suitcase is slammed shut

Mr
Baylor is here
McCall looks up, smiles
Arthur
Arthur crosses
The two men shake hands
Nathan
How are you
Good, Arthur, thanks
Would you like some coffee, juice
No, 'm fine
Well, this is all a bit of a mystery
You certainly got my attention with your phone call
What's this all about
Arthur removes a  from his briefcase
Opens it
Revealing the    and the headline: McCall looks at the paper
Is there something you want me to see
Arthur points at the photograph
McCall looks
beat, then -- Oh my God
: - Cynthia boards a greyhound
Getting the hell out of Dodge
: '  - We  a key in the lock
The door opens and Divinci enters
He looks around
Cynthia
He moves into the bedroom
Sees clothes strewn around and a half empty closet
Shit
He heads back into the living room
Pulls open the door and almost runs into Richard Stein who was just about to knock
(startled) Jesus
Richard Stein is just as startled and it takes him a moment to recognize -- Divinci
Divinci is caught off guard
Richard Stein,
's office
Oh, yeah, sorry
didn't expect -- what're you doing here
have to talk with Cynthia Webb witness in -- well, wait, aren't you and Detective Rodriguez on this one
(vamping) Yeah, yeah, that's why 'm here wanted to go over some of the details
Me, too
Is she there
No
was supposed to meet her at two
(looks at watch) Do you know her
What d'you mean
Well,  just mean, if she's not here
you were
(a little awkward) inside
(forces a smile) Oh, yeah, the legal thing
Well, she's a witness in a murder case
And when they don't answer a knock and the door's open, it's my experience, you know
like to make sure there's no dead bodies layin' around
(pulls door shut) Don't tell on me
No, no, of course not
Well, maybe should wait
She might be stuck in traffic or something
Yeah
If she shows up, let me know
'd like to talk to her, too
Of course
Divinci looks at Stein for a beat, then smiles and -- See you in court
Right
Divinci heads down the walkway
Richard Stein watches him for a moment, then looks at the closed door, then at his watch
: '  - Elliot's office is a cramped space in the of the
buzz of activity outside
The staff is overworked, underpaid and underappreciated
Elliot is reviewing legal documents
Knock on the door
Yeah
The door opens and Arthur Baylor enters
Elliot Goff
Elliot looks up and suddenly recognizes -- Arthur Baylor
Yes
Elliot is stunned and flattered
He stands quickly
Arthur Baylor, oh my God
ahh, would you ahh
are you here to see me
Yes
Arthur shuts the door
: -   - Door opens
Joe is lead into the room by the
Joe looks even better now
His stay in jail has broken his dependency on alcohol
His hair is clean and combed
And he's not as depressed
He stops upon seeing Elliot and Arthur at the table
Both men stand
The guard shuts the door
Arthur looks at Joe for a moment, then says -- William
Joe stares at Arthur as if fighting a lost memory, then -- yes
: - '  - What are you telling me
Richard Stein is facing a not very happy Helen
She is seated behind her desk stacked high with case files
She missed the appointment
She forget you were coming
What
If you want my best guess, 'd say she split
She split, our witness split
Can't we keep our evidence and witnesses from disappearing around here mean what do  have to do, lock them in the trunk of my car
What the fuck is going on
want that bitch back here and on the stand or in jail
Richard Stein nods quickly
'll get her
And he exits fast
He doesn't like it when his boss is pissed
And right now his boss is really pissed
: - seedy side street near the courthouse and jail
The unmarked car pulls up and Divinci gets out
- The interior is sparse
Several    on the walls
All with  , a young tough fighter in the featherweight division, in his best pose, explaining where and when the next bout will be -- but all these posters are at least fifteen years old
Two desks
One for the secretary, who is on vacation, and the other for  , the ex-pugilist
He's put on some pounds in the intervening years, plus an added thin mustache
Manny is on the phone -- -- yeah, uh-huh
(takes notes) Why you think he'd go there
Divinci enters
We need to talk
(covers phone) Just a second
Not just a second, now
Manny glares at Divinci
He doesn't like Divinci, never has, never will
But he's a cop
Cop's you have to make room for
(into phone) 'll call you back
(hangs up) What d'you want, Divinci
Divinci pulls some papers out of his pocket, hands them to Manny
got a witness who took off
gotta get her back
don't got a lotta time
You're the fuckin' police
What're you comin' to me for
Don't ask fuckin' questions, you just find her
Manny, annoyed, looks at the papers -- photo of Cynthia included
Where've  seen her before
She dances
Yeah, right, okay
So what'd she take off for
said -- --  know what you fuckin' said, but you want me to find her  gotta know why the fuck she took off
So  know where not to look
Okay
she's supposed to testify
She got scared, thinks somebody might kill her, so she's hidin'
That's why  want you to find her
If somebody is tryin' to pop her, don't want anyone knowin' where she is
Manny eyes Divinci
He doesn't believe anything anybody tells him
Especially in his business
How long  got
Two days
Shit, two fuckin' days
Find her, puss head
Divinci glares at Manny, then exits
Manny watches him leave
Sure, Detective
Always like to help out the police whenever possible
: - Joe (William) is lead into the courtroom by
Takes his place at the   which includes Elliot and The  , which includes Richard Stein and Helen is going over last minute minutia
are taking seats in the gallery
But another attorney joins the Defense table
It's Arthur Baylor
And Richard Stein double-takes when he sees him
(to Helen) Isn't that Arthur Baylor
Helen turns
Yes
They watch Arthur shake hands with everyone - Elliot, the two young attorneys and Joe
What's he doing here
Arthur takes a seat at the defense table and glances across at Helen and Richard and nods
Helen and Richard are stunned
What the hell
Hear ye, hear ye
All rise, face our flag and recognize the principles for which it stands
The Criminal Court, Department  is now in session
The Honorable Harold
Pine presiding
Everyone rises as    enters
In black robe
Taking his place behind the bench
He sits
Please be seated and come to order
Everyone sits
And even Judge Harold Pine double-takes when he sees Arthur Baylor at the Defense table
The People versus Joe Doe in case number 95-24705
Before we proceed, 'd like to ask the Defense if there's anything this court should be made aware of
Arthur stands
Yes, your honor
have joined the defense in the representation of Mr
William Dane McCall, otherwise known to this court as Joe Doe
Everyone turns to look at Joe (William McCall) in on him
It doesn't look as if he's sure who he is yet
have represented the McCall family for several years before William McCall's disappearance seven years ago
It was assumed that he had died, but since he has reappeared under these tragic circumstances,  would ask this court for a continuance to allow the defense to prepare adequately in light of his real identity now being known
How long do you need
One week should be sufficient
Any objection to a week's continuance by the State
don't
believe so, your honor
Then  grant a one week continuance
We will start the proceedings next Monday morning
Judge Harold Pine taps his gavel
: -
'  - Joe's photograph and scenes of him being lead from the courtroom
Helen and Richard Stein are watching
They can't believe it
-- when it was discovered that the man who has confessed to killing an undercover  agent, was actually himself thought dead for seven years
The man who signed the confession as Joe Doe is actually William Dane McCall, brother of Nathan McCall
Both are sons of the founder of McCall International, a corporation involved in telecommunications, computer design and development and other related industries
The net worth of both men is estimated at over a billion dollars -- : - Parked on the street
Rodriguez and Divinci inside
Rodriguez reads the paper
-- but William McCall shunned the business world and turned his life to medicine, receiving his medical degree from Harvard in 1969
Once again he turned his back on the established norm and spent several years in Africa performing organ transplants for the poor
Rodriguez slams down the paper
Jesus Christ, this is who you picked
goddamn surgeon who performs organ transplants on poor Africans
He was living in the fuckin' street
How the hell was  supposed to know he was a goddamn doctor
He's not a goddamn doctor
You picked a fuckin' Saint to pin a fuckin' murder on
Divinci grabs the paper away from him
Both cops are angry, upset, frustrated and scared to death
When we pick 'em, we really fuckin' pick 'em
We shoulda just picked up the fuckin' Pope
(reading) -- he disappeared seven years ago on September 19 two weeks after the tragic death of his wife and two young children in a multiple vehicle accident
At the time it was assumed that he had returned to Africa, but that was never confirmed
What William McCall has been doing for seven years is now the mystery that the court will try to help unravel
Divinci closes the paper
Alright, alright, let's think here
What's the worse case scenario
Are you asking me if  can think of something worse than what we've done that we can still do, or something worse that might happen to us if this all blows up and we are convicted and sent to jail and die in the electric chair and go to hell
Divinci looks at Rodriguez
Work with me here
'm sorry
'm a little on edge
Would you repeat the question
Both men are quiet for a moment, then -- Even if the doc walks, there's no evidence ties us to it
There's only one person who can connect us to Hudd
Okay, fine,  don't wanna argue about it anymore
Let's just fuckin' kill her
: -  ( ) Manny LaDrew is pouring himself a cup of coffee
His is typing up a letter at her desk
' We need to talk
Manny recognizes the voice
He mouths an oh fuck to himself, then turns around to Divinci who is standing in the doorway
Are you fuckin' with me
No, 'm not fuckin' with you
Are you fuckin' with me
You don't know
Know what
Well this is a good one
You're a cop and you don't know
Stop it
Cops got her
Ain't that a gas
Cops got her, you're a cop, and you gotta find out from me
It's a crazy world we live in, don't you think
Divinci suddenly explodes, going for Manny, grabbing him, slamming him against the wall, his arm to Manny's throat
Cops
What fuckin' cops
don't know what fuckin' cops
All know is, my people got to her sister's place and she was already gone
Her sister said some cops took her
thought it was you
Divinci glares at Manny for a beat, then he storms out
What an asshole
Manny looks down at his Secretary
You're a good judge of character
: -
- at his desk, on the phone
-- look, she's our witness, if she's in custody, somebody better tell me
Divinci slams down the phone
He sits quietly for a moment, then rubs his face
Rodriguez crosses to his desk, sits down
Anything
Nothin'
Nobody knows nothin'
The thinks she's gone
doesn't know shit
If she was bein' held by police, we'd know
Unless she said somethin'
If she said something we wouldn't be sittin' here
(a beat, then --) think it's that lyin' piece of shit
: -
- getting the shit beat out of him
The room is dark
Two men are hammering on Manny
Throwing him against the wall, pulling him up and hitting him in the stomach -- not the face
Throwing him across the room, over the desk
Manny is too hurt to get up
Divinci walks over to him, rubbing his gloved hand
Don't ever lie to me again
Manny looks up weakly
Divinci walks away
Rodriguez opens the door and they exit
: - Joe is sitting on his cot, staring at the floor is in the cell with him, reading a magazine
His name is Duncan looks at Joe
First trial, huh
Yes
got one piece of advise
When you break for lunch, don't get the pastrami
We  the    open
Time to go
Joe gets up
Puts out his hands
They shackle him as we  -- ' Hear ye, hear ye

Killing him instantly

: -
- on the stand, being questioned by Helen
And when you arrested the defendant, did he deny that he had killed Agent Hudd
No
Can you describe the defendant's condition at the time of his arrest
He was drunk
We could smell the booze on him
But we drew blood
He didn't object
We have the blood test report that shows -- (picks up report) -- that he had four times the legal limit to drive
The people would like to enter this into evidence
They so enter it
: -
- on the stand
Elliot is cross-examining
-- and you arrested the defendant four days after the killing
What lead you to suspect Mr
McCall
You ask questions
Work the neighborhood
Find out who was on the street that night
Yes, but specifically Mr
McCall
He had no previous criminal record
We found someone who'd seen him in the area
So we picked him up for questioning
We didn't expect it to be him
But if someone saw him in the area that night we would want to talk to him
If he wasn't the killer, he might've seen the killer
Just routine really
Where did you find the defendant
On the street
Corner of Third and Madison
What was he doing
He was passed out
But you knew it was the man you were looking for
Yes
Based on what
His description
Who provided you with the description
(hesitates a beat) Cynthia something,  think
Elliot moves to the defense table, glances at Arthur as he picks up a paper
Arthur nods approvingly
Elliot looks at the paper
believe her name is Cynthia Webb
According to the statement filed the night she picked him out of the line- up
The name familiar
Yes
that's her
Where did you find Ms Webb
On the street
Same area
And she agreed to pick the defendant out of a line up
Yes
Where you aware that Ms Webb disappeared after she was served with a subpoena
Yes, my partner and  tried to contact her about the case and were unsuccessful
Thank you, Detective, that's all the questions  have
Rodriguez gets up as we -- : / - waitress cruises past tables to the booth in the back
She sets down two scotch and waters to the two men
Rodriguez and Divinci
The waitress exits
Divinci picks up his glass
To justice in all its forms
Rodriguez picks up his glass
We're not home free yet
Without Ms Webb, there's no place they can go
We still got the confession, the gun, the ballistics
And  don't give a shit about all this African doctor crap
the man is a drunk and he's been a drunk for seven goddamn years
So lets have a drink for drunks
Rodriguez reluctantly lifts his glass
They clink and drink
That's the thing about life
You control it or it controls you
Most people don't understand that
They try'n blame their fuck-ups on something or somebody else
But it's not like that
don't wanna hear why your life's a mess
It's a mess cause you're a mess
That simple
They're waitin' to live happily ever after
But after what
After all the shit happens
Well,  got a clue for everybody, the shit never stops happening
So you deal with it or you get buried in it
'm not talkin' about you, you know what 'm sayin' here
Yeah
Life don't work in mysterious ways
There ain't no mystery to it
You just work it
And you don't take it too serious
You can't take it too serious otherwise you get fragile
And you can't be fragile and have any fuckin' fun
You think 'm fragile
That's the first sign of trouble, when you start askin' other people
Rodriguez nods
just wish  knew where the hell she was
: '
- Helen and Richard Stein are working late
Over take-out Chinese
(referring to papers) -- so  think we'll have to rely on the confession for his description of what happened
He'll never take the stand, even if -- The phone rings
Richard picks up

What
When
Where will -- Richard is surprised
He turns to Helen
They found Cynthia Webb
Where
don't know
When
don't know
Well who the hell was that
don't know
They hung up
Richard hangs up the receiver
He and Helen exchange a look
What the fuck is going on
: - Your honor, the people call Ms
Cynthia Webb to the stand
Rodriguez and Divinci are stunned
Cynthia
Elliot is completely surprised
Cynthia
Arthur is never shaken by anything
The courtroom doors open and Cynthia is lead down the aisle by a '
She moves to the chair
But it's Joe's turn to double take
He remembers her
My God, he knows her
It's Cynthia -- the girl from the apartment building
He never saw who pointed him out, but he never expected it to be her
Raise your right hand
Cynthia raises her hand
But her look goes right to Joe
Staring at him
She's never seen Joe like this -- cleaned up, trimmed, handsome
She's not sure she even recognizes him
You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God
She turns her eyes from Joe
Sure
You may be seated
Cynthia sits down
Looks at Divinci
And Joe leans across to Arthur and Elliot
Their conversation is in whispers -- know her
She's the woman who identified you
No
mean  know her
How
'm not sure
think  lived near her
Arthur exchanges a look with Elliot
Arthur turns now and looks at Cynthia
The wheels are turning
Please state your name for the court
Cynthia Webb
Do you see the man that you identified in a police line-up in this room
Yes
Is it the defendant, Mr
McCall
Cynthia looks at Joe
Joe looks straight at her
Cynthia turns her eyes away
Yes
Please describe what you saw the night of September 14th
was comin' out of an all night minimart -- : -   - Cynthia comes out of a   - with a bag of food
She walks down the street and suddenly we  a Followed by a
She turns toward the sound
And we
Then we see a man running
He has a pistol in one hand
Cynthia watches the man run past and disappear into the darkness
: - Cynthia is looking at Helen
And you're positive the man you saw with the gun is the defendant
Instead of looking at Joe, Cynthia turns to Rodriguez and Divinci who are seated in the rows behind the prosecution table
They are looking right at her
They wait for her answer
Yeah
No further questions
Divinci offers her a small smile
Cynthia turns away
Arthur is now standing in front of her
Miss Webb
is it Miss
Yes
Miss Webb, had you ever seen the defendant before that night, the night you described to us
No
Do you know what perjury is
When you lie
When you lie under oath in a court of law
Do you know what the penalty for that is
You go to jail
Yes
Cynthia, have you ever seen the defendant before that night
Objection
The witness has already answered that question
Sustained
just want to give the witness the opportunity to remember if she could have seen Mr
McCall anyplace else before the night in question
Divinci stares at Cynthia
As if willing her to give the answer he wants her to give
Ms
Webb, do you understand the consequences of perjury
Yes
Let's get on with it then
What did you buy the night you went into the mini-mart
What did  buy
You remembered seeing Mr
McCall that night and hearing the gunshot and a car crash
just wondered if you remembered what you bought in the mini-mart
shampoo  think
That's all
Yes
Where do you live
4356 17th Street
Number 37
Is that close to where this mini- mart is
Close
Sort of
How far would you say
don't really know
Within walking distance
No
don't think so
Did you walk there that night or drive
ahh
drove
You drove
But when you left the mini-mart you stated that you walked down the street
Yeah
How far
to the corner
Objection
Your honor,  don't see a point to this line of questioning
Is there a point
Yes, your honor
Since this is the only witness, 'm trying to establish what the scene was like that night
Try to get there as quickly as possible
(to Cynthia) And how far away from the corner was the Mini-mart
For example was it in the middle of the block, close to the corner, where
In the middle  think
So you walked all the way to the corner
assume then you were walking back to your car, yes
yeah
Was there a reason you parked so far away
(getting nervous) Um
there were lots of cars parked on the street
Was there anyone else on the street besides you
No
Lots of cars, but no people
Any traffic
don't remember
So you were the only person to see Joe on the street that night
didn't see anybody else
So you heard a gunshot, a car crash and a man running with a gun in his hand
Yes
What did you do then
Did you call the police, 911
went home
You went home
Straight home
Yes
And you're sure it was Joe you saw that night
Yes
When you went home
Yes
Arthur pauses
When you went home you saw Joe
Cynthia realizes what she's said
No
Objection
Defense is trying to confuse the witness
'm not trying to confuse the witness, it's the witness that's trying to confuse the court
have witnesses who will refute her testimony
Witnesses who were on that corner the night of the shooting, who never saw Ms
Webb, who never heard the gunshot, who never saw Joe run past
Ms Webb saw Joe outside her apartment building that night because he lived in the alley next to it
Isn't that right, Ms Webb
Arthur turns dramatically to Cynthia
She is scared
Objection
Everyone's attention is on Cynthia
When  referred to him as Joe, you knew who  was talking about, didn't you
This case is the People versus Mr
William McCall
Not Joe
Joe has never been mentioned in this trial
How did you know who  was talking about, Ms
Webb
Cynthia looks from Arthur to Divinci
Divinci is frozen
Rodriguez is sweating
Then Cynthia turns and looks at Joe
Joe looks at her, feeling sorry for her
Not hating her
Ms
Webb, how did you know that Joe was the defendant
Cynthia lowers her eyes to the floor
He lived in the alley next to my apartment building
Helen and Richard Stein are stunned yet again
(to herself) Oh shit
Divinci and Rodriguez are doing their best to remain cool, calm and collected
Why did you lie to this court
don't know
Are you afraid of somebody
don't know
Are you protecting somebody
don't know
Answer the questions, Ms
Webb or 'll be forced to cite you for contempt
Cynthia looks up at the judge
She's not talking
: having her mug shots taken
Holding a number
On the  -- : -  - Driving
She didn't talk
Don't hold your breath
You think she'll talk
know she'll talk
We'll make it look gang related
Problem is we're gonna need another gun
The problem
Have you forgotten
She's in fucking jail
That's the goddamn problem
Since when is being in jail a guaranty of a long life
You just get a fuckin' gun
- Rodriguez gets out of the car
Divinci pulls away, driving into traffic
Rodriguez heads into the Station
: - Divinci enters
Manny looks up from his desk
His face is bruised and bandaged
Oh shit
didn't do anything
Everything's fine, Manny
just came to apologize
(looks at secretary) We need some privacy
Manny looks at Divinci, then motions for his Secretary to take a walk
She gets up, exits
Just one more favor
want you to bail somebody out of jail
You're kiddin'
Bail's twenty-five thousand
Divinci pulls out a piece of paper
want her out tonight
And don't tell her who
It's a surprise
And how'm  payin' for this
They don't take American Express
Divinci pulls a plastic bag filled with cocaine out of his pocket -- tosses it onto Manny's desk
know you know how to exchange that
It's worth a lot more than twenty- five grand
You can keep the change
(points to cocaine) want her back in two hours
Or 'll nail you for possession
How'd you get to be such a prick
Divinci exits
What a piece of shit
: - Cynthia sits alone in her cell
: - Joe lies on his cot
But even though he is in jail for murder, he is no longer the bum
This is a new man now
Clean shaven
Hair cut
Prison clothes neat
Duncan rolls over on his cot
You don't have to say nothin', but
you really a doctor
was
a surgeon
No shit, no shit, really
surgeon
know 'm nobody to judge, but you musta been a smart guy
What the hell's a smart guy like you doin' in here
Joe looks up at Duncan, hesitates, then -- had an affair with another woman
a nurse at the hospital worked at
It was nothing
can't even remember much about her
Except my wife found out
We had a fight
She left the house, took the kids
She was hysterical
should've done something
gone after them,  don't know
they were killed in a car accident about a mile from the house
've never told anybody that
about why she left
Duncan nods
Hey, doc, you can trust me
It won't go no farther
: 6TH    - Rodriguez is outside the Station
Looking nervous and upset
The unmarked car pulls up
Rodriguez moves for the car
He gets in and the car pulls away
- Divinci drives
Rodriguez sweats
Divinci notices
You get the gun
got it
Everything okay
Are you kidding
We're going to kill a goddamn witness who's in fucking jail because we killed an undercover agent
'm sorry, but this kinda shit troubles me a little
Take off the dress and get back in the game
We gotta do what we gotta do
Yeah
know
Let's just get it over with
Divinci glances at Rodriguez
He's more nervous than normal
: -  - Manny walks out of the jail building
Cynthia is with him
don't understand
Why can't you tell me who put up the bond
Look, a guy comes in, says bail her out, gives me the money,  do it
That's how  make my living,  bail fuckin' people outa jail
You wait with me
Was it a cop
Yeah, right
Cops bail people outa jail all the time
Doesn't there seem to be a dichotomy there for you
don't like this
You wanna stay in jail, that's up to you
Or you come with me
What'd he look like
You're a stripper right
Lotta guys fall in love with your type
But they don't know how to get close, know what  mean
Somebody wants you to owe them something
(shrugs) Take it or leave it
Manny starts down the steps
Cynthia hesitates, then follows
-     - Divinci and Rodriguez watch Cynthia get into the car with Manny
This is the last time, Frank
The last time we kill somebody
Yeah, it's the last time
This'll be eleven, Frank
Eleven is enough
get the picture
Divinci looks at Rodriguez
He's staring out the window, but he looks ill
Something is not right with him
It was all okay until you shot Hudd
What's goin' on here
You mad at me or something
It wasn't my idea to start killing people, Frank
That's all 'm sayin'
We're in this goddamn mess because you started killing people
Drug dealers don't qualify as people
Never did, never will
So what the hell's wrong with you tonight
You suddenly worried about where all the money went
'm just sick of it, that's all
Divinci stares at Rodriguez for a beat, then starts car
: - The unmarked car turns off the street onto the side street and stops
The lights go out
- What're you doin'
need some fresh air
Divinci exits
Rodriguez hesitates, then gets out with him
- Frank -- Talk to me, okay
Just fuckin' talk to me
Rodriguez hesitates a moment, then -- don't know
owe some money don't know how 'm gonna pay it
You gambling again
Yeah, yeah
just couldn't
Frank
let's forget about this
Let's just get the fuck outa here
We got enough money, let's go
We'll get outa the country or something
Divinci turns toward Rodriguez
And he's got his pistol out
What the hell're you doin'
Take off your shirt
What're you talkin' about
Just take off your shirt
If there's nothin' to worry about, then 'll apologize
But 'm not gonna argue
Take off your fuckin' shirt now
What is this, you piece of shit
You don't trust me
Is that it
' ' '
Take off your shirt
Fuck you, you don't trust me
'm askin' you one more time
You wanna shoot me
Shoot me
Divinci hesitates
He doesn't want to
This is his partner
beat, then he lowers his gun
Okay, 'm sorry
You're right
'm fuckin' nervous
Like you
Forget it
This thing
shit
Let's just get it over with
Divinci holsters his gun
Rodriguez hesitates, breathes a sigh, then returns to the car
They both get back in
- Divinci starts up the car
'll just feel a whole lot better when she's dead
Then we're off the hook
Right
Divinci starts to shift gears, but suddenly throws his elbow into Rodriguez' face
And Divinci is all over him like a tornado
Slamming a fist into his face repeatedly
He grabs his shirt and rips it open  the strapped to his body, recording their every word
'
Divinci puts his revolver to Rodriguez' head
Rodriguez, bleeding from the mouth and nose, looks at Frank
Yeah
yeah
am, 'm a fuckin' rat
traded you, Frank,  fuckin' traded you
Simms knows everything
Divinci pulls back the hammer, ready to blow Rodriguez' head off
Just fuckin' shoot me, get it the fuck over with Divinci is ready to pull the trigger
You're fuckin' right
Divinci rips the wires off the recorder
Rodriguez closes his eyes, waiting for the end
tense moment, then -- Get out
Rodriguez opens his eyes, looking at Divinci, who is still holding the gun to his head
Another moment, then -- Frank -- (calm) Get outa the car
beat, then Rodriguez gets out
Divinci looks up at his partner
This is why you can never -- ever -- lose your sense of fuckin' humor
- The car tears away, leaving Rodriguez alone in the alley
: -      - Rodriguez pushes open the door to his apartment, enters
Shuts the door
Stands alone in the room for a moment, then suddenly erupts in rage
Ripping off his coat, ripping off his shirt, ripping off the tape recorder taped to his chest
He throws the recorder on the ground
Stomps on it until it's shattered into pieces
He stares at the broken recorder
'  () guess we caught you at a bad time
Rodriguez spins around
Vic steps into the moonlight streaming in through the window
Behind him is Cutless Supreme
But we all have problems
Rodriguez suddenly  and
He tackles Vic
But in the darkness we can't see anything
Until the explosion of a  and the  of flames lights up the room
moment of silence then -- Oh shit
You shot him, you fuckin' shot him
Two men stumble to the door
Leaving one on the floor
The door is flung open and Vic runs out
Followed by Cutless Supreme
: -
- The crime scene is swarming with cops,  and
The task of evidence collection in progress
Rodriguez' body on the floor
Agent Simms is standing over the body with Agent Sarkasian
Divinci musta figured it
didn't think he'd kill his own partner though
He's an animal
Hooper comes up behind Simms
Recorders busted up
But we might be able to salvage some of the tape
want him
You understand me, don't care what it takes
want that sonuvabitch
Simms heads for the door
Sarkasian and Hooper follow
: - car pulls up in front
- It is deadly quiet
We   around the office until we find Manny in his chair, sprawled back
Continuing to until we see Cynthia sprawled on the couch
But no signs of blood
Just the bodies
The door opens
enters
All we  are  in hands
Cynthia and Manny wake up with a start
Manny is scared
Shit
Who the fuck're you
comes out
And now we see Agents Hooper and Sarkasian
Ms
Webb
We'd like you to come with us
Cynthia looks at Manny
She's pissed
This was the big secret
Shit
You're an asshole
Cynthia puts her coat on and heads for the door
Manny doesn't know what the hell is going on
: -
- Cynthia is in with Agents Simms, Hooper and Sarkasian
Who set it up
don't know
It was Divinci wasn't it
don't know
Which one pulled the trigger
Divinci or Rodriguez
don't know
Agent Simms looks right into Cynthia's eyes
Detective Rodriguez is dead
He was shot in the head last night
This gets Cynthia's attention
Rodriguez was wearing a recorder
Divinci found it
You can do addition, can't you
You're full of shit
Just tell us what you know
Cynthia looks at both of them
Where's Divinci
We don't know
But we're gonna find him
You're gonna find him
(smiles sarcastically) Right
don't know a fuckin' thing
Simms stares at her for a moment, then turns to Hooper and nods
Hooper takes Cynthia's arm and leads her out of the office
When the door closes -- Get a copy of the tape to Bailor
But make sure it doesn't come from us
: - Cynthia is alone in her cell
We  footsteps
She looks up as the  approaches
Your attorney's here
What attorney
-   - Cynthia enters the office
The Guard shuts the door
Cynthia finds herself facing Arthur Baylor
tape recorder on the table in front of him
Hi, Cynthia
Please sit down
got nothin' to say
So 'm told
Arthur pushes the tape recorder and we  -- ' Take off your shirt
' Fuck you, you don't trust me
' 'm askin' you one more time
' You wanna shoot me
Shoot me
' Okay, 'm sorry
You're right
'm fuckin' nervous
Like you
Forget it
This thing
shit
Let's just get it over with
'll just feel a whole lot better when she's dead
Then we're off the hook
Arthur watches Cynthia's reaction to "when she's dead
" But Cynthia has seen enough not to be too shocked by anything
And her reaction is subtle
She knows better than to reveal what she's really feeling and thinking
' Right
' '
' Yeah
yeah
am, 'm a fuckin' rat
traded you, Frank,  fuckin' traded you
Simms knows everything
Just fuckin' shoot me, get it the fuck over with ' You're fuckin' right
The recording ends
Arthur shuts off the machine
think you know my client is innocent
That's all  care about, my client
But  understand why you're scared
You're already facing perjury charges
My guess is, your involvement is deeper than that
But  don't really care, 'm not after you get nothing if you go to jail
But think if  help you,  can help my client
how
William -- Joe -- didn't do it, did he
Cynthia hesitates, then shakes her head
Why don't you sit down
beat, then Cynthia pulls up a chair
: -
- angry
No goddamn way
'm not going to grant that whore immunity
She lied on the stand, she's protecting somebody
And she's involved
want them all
Arthur, who was sitting across from him, stands
Before  leave, let me remind you that you have shit for a case
If you really care about seeing justice for your dead agent, don't blow this deal
Immunity for her testimony is a small price for a bad cop
It's the only way she's going to talk
Simms glares at Arthur
And William McCall walks, right now, all charges dropped
Simms hesitates, then -- If what she says is any good, 'll deal
If it isn't, then nobody goes anywhere
: -    - Cynthia is lead down the hall by
They enter an office
-    - Agents Simms, Hooker, Sarkasian and   are waiting inside with Arthur
Cynthia is lead into the room
The guards withdraw, closing the door
Cynthia looks at the men, then at the on the table and the empty chair
is waiting
Cynthia looks at Arthur, then sits down in the chair
: - swarm around Arthur and Joe as they exit the courthouse
How does it feel to be a free man again
Arthur and Joe head down the steps to a waiting
Do you remember everything that happened to you
What are your plans
just want to go back to work
As a surgeon
Yes
What about the signed confession, did the police coerce you into signing it
'm sorry, no more questions
They get into the back of the waiting limo and it pulls away
- Nathan is in the back, staring at Joe
Arthur sits next to Joe
Nathan smiles
Joe smiles
Good to have you back, Will
'd like to make one stop
know
: - The limousine is parked curbside
Nathan and Arthur wait
Watching Joe walk across the lawn
He stops, looking down
The grave stones are for his wife and two children
He sits down beside them
It's very near where Agent Hudd was buried
: - Giant party in progress
Expensive cars parked along the drive
- Filled with well-wishers in  and
Arthur Bailor and Elliot in attendance
Elliot isn't used to this much glory, but he's taking credit where where he can -- with one of the
-- you know, it just didn't make sense, a man wanting to be punished for a crime
How many times does that happen
Once in a lifetime, can tell you
to Arthur, who is also receiving his share of the credit
-- to tell the truth,  had no other witnesses to refute her testimony
But she didn't know that
All we knew was that she was reluctant to testify
You look for signs
And    Joe and Nathan
My God, we thought you were dead, you know
It's just incredible that you're here
Life moves in such strange ways
Oh, just think what might've happened to you had you not been arrested for killing that poor policeman
You still might be on the street
Joe just takes it all in, smiling and nodding
Joe, you look wonderful
After what you've been through
just can't imagine
() When you're ready to come back to work, let me know
've already spoken to the board, they're ready to re- certify you anytime
can put you in the emergency sector until you get warmed up
We all want you back
We can't afford to waste someone of your talent
beat, then Joe smiles
'm ready
past  as we -- : We  the  of the  -- a And in  across the screen: - The neon blares as usual
- And there's Cynthia
Back bumping and grinding to the music
He life hasn't changed at all
And she knows it
But there's nothing else she can do
: '  -  ( ) Door opens
Cynthia enters
Shuts the door
Tries the light
It doesn't go on
Suddenly a man is next to her -- '  () guess you had no choice
Cynthia tries to move, but a hand grabs her arm
And now we see Divinci
He looks like hell
man on the run
Desperate and dangerous
He hasn't shaved
His clothes are filthy
He looks like
Joe
Cynthia looks up at him
You had to do the right thing
What d'you want
What do  want
Divinci suddenly shoves her hard across the room
Why're you asking me that
You gonna grant me three wishes
don't know where to start
Let's see
money would be nice
love would be better
but a little loyalty
you can never get enough of that
(moves up to her) But we'll start with
money
Divinci pushes her into the bedroom
-  ( ) Cynthia goes to her closet, pulls out a box, opens it
It's got her savings
This is all 've got
Divinci grabs the money and stuffs it into his jacket pocket
They'll catch you
don't think so
You wanna bet
They don't have a clue, baby
And you wanna know why
Because  am following my heart
Divinci puts aside his gun
And pushes Cynthia down on the bed
He leans in close to her
Face to face
And they don't know where that is
So tell me about your plans
think 'd like to hear 'em now
Divinci looks at Cynthia for a moment, almost with remorse
Loyalty is what it all comes down to
Nothing holds together when it's gone
And once it's gone, you don't ever get it back
You shouldn't've told 'em
shouldn't've done a lotta things in my life
But that's not one of 'em
Let me tell you something
the only difference between a liar and a witness is that just one of 'em knows what he's doing
-  ( ) It is dark and quiet
No clue as to what's going on inside
And we hold on this for a long moment
Just wondering what's she being made to do
And then there's a
Divinci exits the bedroom quickly
He is upset
We  the close
fall like snow flakes on Cynthia's body draped across the bed
The pillow on the floor beside her with the stuffing blown out
She has a hole in her chest, right above her heart
: - Manny unlocks the door, enters his office
' Shut the door and lock it
Jesus Christ
Manny looks toward the voice
Divinci is sitting on the floor out of sight
Holding his revolver
You scared the shit outa me
Lock the door
Manny locks the door
One more favor, Manny
Since when did  become such a good guy
'm takin' some time off
want a car, here tonight, and a driver
You can do that for your old friend, right
(disgusted) Yeah,  can do that
But you are a hot fuckin' potato
And drivers that don't talk, don't come cheap
got the money
Just put it together
: - An  races up to the  entrance
- push the gurney down the hall
Cynthia is conscious on the gurney
Looking up at the ceiling
She is fading
We  -- -- come on, hang in there, hold on
' ()
and
The gurney pushes past and      moving out of an Operating Room
Pulling off masks and rubber gloves bloody from surgery
One of them is Joe
The other surgeon pats him on the back
Just like riding a bike
Joe finally breathes a sigh of relief and manages a smile
: -
- pulls up in front of the office
Tinted windows
- Manny is looking out the window
Leather upholstery, moon roof,
What more could you ask for
Divinci looks out
Gun in hand
He's cleaned himself up
He's now wearing a Hawaiian shirt, slacks
traveler
Better not be a set up
Want me to hold your hand
Just walk me to the door
- The Lincoln idles at the curb
Divinci and Manny exit the office
Divinci glances up and down the street as they move toward the car
Manny opens the back door
Nobody inside
think 'll let you live
You are a real prince
Now how about my money
Divinci hands Manny a wad of cash from his pocket, then gets into the back of the car
You never saw me
Don't  wish that were true
He closes the door
The Lincoln pulls away
Manny watches it move off down the street
Have a nice trip
- Driving
Divinci in the back
Can only see the ' in the
Head south
Get on the interstate
Don't break the speed limit
Divinci settles into the leather seat
Looks at the rear view mirror
You know, the one thing about life
you can never lose your sense of humor
Without it, you got nothin'
Suddenly the driver turns around, holding a 9mm and fires
Divinci's head snaps back as the of the Lincoln
And now we recognize the driver
It's Clyle
Dunner
Fuckin'
moves right into
filling the screen
The car stops
We  the   and
And into
: -
- into
' -- run the cardioplegia
Faces appear
Looking down
We recognize Joe and one of the friends from the party -- Sinclair
She's fibrilating
Go on bypass
Faces move away as we    in operation reappears
back now, revealing the room
And the operation in progress
Forceps
( nurse hands him forceps) Just like old times
wouldn't have done this without you
owe you
Lucky to have a donor
Never would've survived the night
Have a suture ready
(picks up suture) heard it was a cop's heart
Joe looks at the nurse
He was shot in the head a couple hours ago
They think it was gang related
The    bleed the scene to  and we -- : - crashing on white sand
with the clear blue water racing up the sand to a woman in a bathing suit, sitting alone
We    , past her stomach, to her where we see a
We
It's Cynthia
Staring out at the ocean
Palm trees behind her
She's beautiful
She leans back, hands behind her and
She smiles
Her life has changed
