'  -   1 Looking incredibly weary,  , 30's, enters his apartment in his business suit
He stumbles into -- 2
'  -   2 He drops his briefcase, strips off his jacket, loosens his tie and collapses onto the bed like a dead man the alarm clock which reads "1:23
" : 3
'  -   3 The alarm clock now reads "4:59
" It switches to "5:00" and a   goes off
Nick sits up in bed, shuts off the buzzer and painfully forces himself out of bed
He hurries out of the bedroom, passing the saddest, deadest houseplant in history

'  -   4 Nick opens his fridge to reveal a wasteland of moldy leftover containers and crusty condiments
The orange juice container he grabs is empty
Damn
He opens the freezer
It contains nothing but multiple boxes of "Jimmy Dean's Breakfast Bowl -- with Bacon
" He pops one in the microwave, then glances over at a framed photo of a slightly younger Nick kissing a smiling on the cheek
The frame reads: "  Grandma
" Nick sighs sadly

He takes some toilet paper from the roll and wipes his mouth with it

He loses track and brushes his face with the toothbrush

Clearly, no laundry has been done in a while

(
) () Hello
() Hey, Jenna, it's Nick
(
) It's five-thirty in the morning, Nick
Yeah, sorry
This is like the only time  have to make any personal calls
just wanted to see if you felt like going out again because  had a great time with you on our last date
(
) Our last date was two weeks ago
You haven't called me since
know and that's my bad
've been swamped at work -- (
) Yeah,  remember
Work was all you talked about when we went out
Right
Well, 'm up for a promotion which will give me a lot more free time -- () 3
9 : 9 (
) Listen, 'm actually seeing someone
And even if  weren't, the last thing  need is some career-obsessed guy complaining about work all the time
See you around, Nick
She hangs up

Nick exits his car and runs full-speed to the entrance

-   11 Nick bursts through the doors and looks at his watch
It reads "6:02
" He looks up at a security camera with a flashing red light, indicating he is on tape
Fuck
: 12
'  -  12 Nick sits at his desk inputting information from a large of documents into a spreadsheet on his computer
The clock on his computer turns to "8:00
" (
) Nick
Nick jumps, startled
He turns to see his boss, , 40's, standing behind him
Yes
See you in my office

'  -      - 13 of the lobby security camera footage on a television
The time code at the bottom of the screen reads "6:02
" We see Nick looking up at the camera and silently mouthing the word "Fuck
" The image freezes and we to see Harken holding the remote
Nick stands across from him
Here's my concern, Nick
You're a punctual guy
You understand the importance of getting to work on time
So that leaves me to wonder if there isn't something wrong with the internal clock in our security system
What do you think
don't know, Mr
Harken
might have been a minute late
Two minutes according to this
So either you're a liar -- which know you're not -- or our system is off by a full minute
And if that's the case,  have no choice but to dismiss Thomas, our longtime security coordinator
Okay,  might have been two minutes late
There's an uncomfortable beat
Then -- So you did lie
No,  -- Harken picks up the phone
Who are you calling
Thomas
'm letting him go
() 5
13 : 13 Wait
Okay,  guess  lied
But didn't mean to -- (hangs up phone) Trust is everything in this office, my friend
know you've been working your tail off for that promotion, but if  can't trust you, how can  make you Senior  of Sales
understand
You can trust me
Now you sound like my wife
He glances at a framed photo on his desk
14  -  14 of the hot, bikini-clad
, 30's, standing on a beach
15    15 ( ) `Trust me, honey
' `Trust me
' Meanwhile, she's making love to every guy in the neighborhood
() Oh, 'm sure she's
loyal to -- How could you possibly know that
don't
Are you making love to my wife, Nick
What
No
() 6
15 : 15 'm just kidding around
She's out of your league
No offense
None taken
Hmm
Harken has crossed to a credenza with several bottles of booze, two glasses and an ice bucket
He begins to fill a glass with ice and Scotch
Would you like one
It's 8:15
You think there's something wrong with a man enjoying a drink in the morning
() No, no
It's fine
'd love a drink
Harken hands him the drink he just poured
Thank you
My pleasure
Harken returns to his chair and sits
Aren't you having one
It's 8:15, Nick
'm not an alcoholic
Oh
Well,  only took it because thought you were having one
You took a drink because you thought  was going to have one
() () 7
15 : (2) 15 (') That doesn't exactly sound like something a Senior  would do
Well,  -- What if you thought  was going to dip my balls in honey and shaved coconut
Would you do that too
( ) Of course not
Of course not
Anyway, we've moved up the date of the  so you're gonna need to complete your due diligence by Monday
You'll probably need to be here all weekend
() Okay
Hey, you want a promotion, you've gotta earn it
Life's a marathon and you can't win a marathon without putting a few Band-Aids on your nipples
(huh
) Got it
Nick gets up to go
Nick
Nick turns back
That's 18-year-old Scotch can't really pour it back into the bottle
Nick, unsure of what to do, picks up the glass and gulps it down

Boy,  have to get used to driving with this heavy ring on
keep swerving to the left
Aww
You really like it
love it
feel like a queen
18      18 It's tiny and yellowish
19    19 Well, you're my queen
love you, Stacy
Have a great day at work
They kiss
Dale exits the car
20
-   20 Stacy drives off
Dale steels himself for what lies ahead, then goes inside

-   21 Dale enters the waiting room, passing a few
He grabs a mask and goggles from a supply room, then heads -- 9
22
-   22 Dale finds his boss,
, 30's, sexy but with something a little off, hovering over a patient,
, 50's
Dale seems visibly uneasy
All right, Mr
Anderton, 'm going to give you the nitrous now and your root canal will be over before you know it
( ) Dale
Please
Dale turns the valve on the tank and soon Mr
Anderton's eyes roll back in his head
Julia shuts the door, picks up a drill and begins boring into the patient's molar
(loudly, over the ) How are you today, Dale
'm fine
Thanks
You get a haircut
Uh-huh
Looks good
Thank you
You ever watch that show, `Gossip Girl'
Uh, no
watched it last night
'll tell you, lot of cuties on that program
() Number 7 scraper, please
Dale hands her a tool
() 10
22 : 22 Thank you
fingered myself so hard to Penn Badgely,  broke a nail
Dale sighs and looks down at the unconscious Mr
Anderton
This obviously isn't the first time Julia has spoken this way
'd let that kid put it in my ass
Bet he's packing a plus-size sausage under those True Religions
(then, looking up at ) Probe
What
need the probe
Oh, right
He hands her the tool
Bet you're no shrimp in the cock department either, huh, Dale
Julia, please
Oh, come on
You know  like to fool around
She lifts the patient's limp hand and cups it over her breast
( ) Mr
Anderton
Bad
She smacks the lifeless hand and cackles with laughter
Okay, enough fun
Let's get back to work
Water, please
() 11
22 : (2) 22 Dale hands her the Water Jet tool
Julia briefly sprays some water in the patient's mouth, then casually sprays down Dale's crotch with it
Hey
Sorry, 'm a squirter
(studying his groin) think  can just make out our friend
Looks like someone is circumcised
All right, Julia, listen
You can't keep doing this
know,  know, you have a -- She's not my girlfriend anymore
Stacy and  got engaged last night
Julia's whole demeanor changes
She becomes deadly serious
What
We're engaged
You're actually going to marry that little dummy
Hey
thought you said she was just a hole for your dick
That's a horrible thing to say never said that
Mr
Anderton  groggily
() 12
22 : (3) 22 () 'm very disappointed in you, Dale

Shaken, Dale hands her the tool

Unlike Nick and Dale, Kurt seems content in his workplace reasonably cute, but by no means drop-dead gorgeous, approaches his desk with a package
Excuse me
Can you sign for this, please
( ) Sure
( ) Whoa, whoa
Hold on
What is this
'm sorry
This is one of those hidden camera shows, isn't it
What do you mean
Come on
You're way too good- looking to be a  girl
What are you, a model
An actress
What's gonna happen when  open this box
Is something going to jump out at me
() 13
24 : 24 () Nothing's gonna happen
'm just a  girl
Shut up
() You shut up
It's true
Well, then,  need to take you out to dinner
Why
Because  want to be able to tell my friends that  took out the hottest  girl in America
Come on, what do you say
She considers this briefly, then scribbles her number on a Post-it note
Awesome
'm Kurt
Myrna
Pretty name
How's Tuesday
Macaroni Grill
Okay
See you then, Myrna
She heads off
Kurt opens his  and scribbles " Girl" in the Tuesday slot
We see every night of the week is filled with appointments with other women: "Barnes & Noble girl," "Lauren
Laura
," "Blonde Chick" and so on
(
) Busy week
Kurt looks up at  , 70s, the kindly, affectionate owner of the company
() 14
24 : (2) 24 Hey, Jack
Yeah, just doing my part for the women of America
() You're what we used to call a rapscallion
That sounds a lot more innocent than `sex addict
' Walk with me, Kurt
The two of them head toward the exit
wanted to talk to you about -- Last quarter's profits
ran the numbers
We're down by 11 percent year-to-year
It's this damn recession
What about cost-cutting measures
Well,  know you don't want to cut -- No way
These people have worked their asses off for me
There's no reason they should suffer
Kurt looks at his boss with admiration
There's a lot of love between these two
There's also the issue of our hazardous waste disposal
We're paying a lot right now and the Bolivians have come back with a very good offer
You know why it's good
Because they'll dump our chemicals in rivers, pollute water supplies and hurt people
've spent my life building this company
() () 15
24 : (3) 24 (') Would you want the Pellit name to be associated with something like that
No,  wouldn't
As they pass the unisex rest room, they see , 30s and clearly pregnant, looking uncomfortable as she waits to get in
Everything okay, Margie
Oh hi, Mr
Pellit
Kurt
've just been waiting to get in there for a while now
Who's in there
It's
your son
() Of course it is
(then, knocking on ) Bobby
There's someone waiting
You almost done in there
After a long beat, the door opens and out steps , late-20s, weasely-looking, sniffing a bit too much and rubbing his nose repeatedly
There's something unnaturally energetic about him
What the fuck
guy can't get any privacy in this place
It's all yours, Margie
Margie quickly slips into the rest room and shuts the door
You know, Bobby, you seem to be spending more time in that bathroom than at your desk these days
() 16
24 : (4) 24 Well, then, you're fucking stupid, Dad
Because that's clearly not true
All  ask is that you do your part around here, son
do my part
do other people's parts
But you just like to ride my ass because 'm your son don't see you screaming at -- (: ) -- dickskin here
() That's because Kurt does his work and does it well
You could take a lesson from him
() The only thing 'd take a lesson from him on is being gay
And wouldn't take that lesson because don't want to be gay
( ) Come on, Kurt
Kurt follows after Jack
Yeah, that's what  thought
Jack and Kurt pass a receptionist desk and go out into -- 25
-   25 Kurt walks Jack to his Cadillac
Tell me something, Kurt
Are you happy here
You kidding
It's the best job in the world
() 17
25 : 25 'm glad to hear you say that
'm rewriting my will tonight and there's going to be a special place for you in there
He gives Kurt a hug like a doting father, then climbs into his car
As Jack pulls out and begins driving across the parking lot, Kurt waves
Suddenly, the car's begins to honk in a
Kurt lowers his hand as the car veers off the pavement, slowly cruising into a tree where it stops abruptly, the horn still honking
bewildered Kurt runs toward the car, as we -- : 26
'  -   26 Kurt sits at a table looking depressed
He died instantly
They say his heart burst in his chest like a water balloon
to reveal Kurt is sitting with Dale, who looks just as dejected
Wow
Sorry, man
He was like a dad to you
loved him
And  loved working for him
And now his idiot son is gonna be in charge
You know how many times 've caught him doing blow at work
to reveal Nick sitting beside Dale
That sucks
You were the only one of us who didn't totally hate his job
() Did  tell you Harken tricked me into having a drink at eight o'clock this morning
The guy's the devil
() 18
26 : 26 thought he was giving you a promotion
He is
And he's got to do it before the General Meeting next week
Well, at least your boss doesn't sexually harass you
This again
'm telling you, she's out of control
It's a full-on hostile work environment
She's a woman who wants to have sex with you
How bad can it be
Today she sprayed my crotch with water so she could see the outline of my wiener
Why don't you just fuck her
'm engaged
Oh yeah
Congratulations, by the way
Thank you
There's gotta be other dental hygienist jobs out there
can't apply for another job, remember
Oh, right
Because you'd have to tell them you're a child molester
() 19
26 : (2) 26 He's not a child molester
He just took his dick out in a playground
It was nighttime and  was peeing
And it's bullshit that  got put on the registered sex offender list for that
It worked out
Julia probably hired you because she's a sexual deviant herself
Why would they put a playground next to a bar anyway
That's entrapment
-  walks past
( ) Well,  should go see if that girl wants to bone
Kurt groans as he pulls himself out of the booth
thought you were all broken up about your boss dying
This is how  grieve, okay
Kurt heads off after the girl
Man
He must be grieving all the time
27
-   27 Nick sits alongside five other - at a conference table
Harken's chair at the head is empty
Nick pours himself some water from a glass pitcher on the table
He did say ten o'clock, right
() 20
27 : 27 - Yeah
Do you know what this is about
It just said `staff meeting' on the memo
() Funny how he gets all over me if 'm a minute late, but he makes us wait fifteen
(
) You were two minutes late, Nick
Nick jumps as Harken enters
And  didn't know  had to punch a clock with you
You don't
Of course you don't
'm sorry -- 'm going to attribute this to your drinking problem
don't have a -- (with a smile to the ) Let's get started
Shall we
Nick's eyes narrow
Suddenly, he grabs the heavy glass pitcher from the table and    ' Shards of glass fly everywhere as Harken falls from his chair onto the floor
: 28   () 28 Harken is fine
Nick is as we left him
Okay, have we figured out our best sales distribution plan for the new model year handsets
() 21
28 : 28 Nick's - bury their heads in their notes
Nick tensely raises his hand
Yes
simulated a number of sales cycles, factoring in likely end- users, point-of-sale limitations and specific demographic variables
And
And in my opinion, an open plan selling process in our top 30 markets along with targeted upgrade offers to existing customers promises the greatest yield
Harken nods
Is he impressed
Thank you, Nick
Did everyone see how he did that
Yes, he may be a pathological liar and have a crippling drinking problem, but when the chips are down, Nick has what it takes
Nick glows
Which brings us to our next order of business
've decided who want as our new Senior  of Sales
He's sitting right here among you
Everyone turns to look at Nick
It's me
Everyone's head snaps back to Harken
What
() 22
28 : (2) 28 've decided to absorb the responsibilities of the Senior position into my own
realized if you want something done right, you do it yourself
So, 'm going to be knocking down the wall between my office and what would've been the Senior 's to create a single, enormous office
However, as a cost-cutting measure,  will only be taking 85% of the additional salary 'm entitled to
It's called self- sacrifice, people
Learn from this
Harken heads out
29
-  -   29 Nick hurries to catch up with Harken
Mr
Harken, can  speak to you
What is it
You've been hinting for months that  was in line for that promotion
And look how hard you've worked
So you've just been lying to me
Not lying
Motivating
We're all on the same team here, Nick
We're all trying to find Lorenzo's oil before it's too late for little Lorenzo
Besides, 'm the one who's taking on a lot more work
() 23
29 : 29 (barely keeping it ) Last month you kept me working so late  didn't get to say goodbye to Gam Gam
What
My grandmother
told you needed to see her but you said 'd be fired if  left early
She died before  could get to the hospital
( ) She taught me how to swim -- Oh, my God
had no idea
that you called your grandmother Gam Gam
() don't mean to laugh, but that's adorable
(off Nick's outraged ) Look, Nick, 'm sorry you didn't get to say bye-bye to Gam Gam make you work late because you're an invaluable part of this operation
And  need you in your current position
've been in that position for eight years now
Why would  stay here after being treated like this
Because  will see to it that no one else in our industry will hire you
What
Anyone who interviews you will want my letter of recommendation
And 'm prepared to tell them that you are a dishonest, insubordinate drunk
() 24
29 : (2) 29 But that's not true
You can't do this
Harken gets directly in Nick's face, speaking softly but intensely
Let me make this clear, you weak, little fuck
own you
You're my bitch
Don't make the mistake of thinking you have free will
Because  can crush you any time like
(stepping back, ) Settle in, friend
You're here for the long haul
Harken slaps him hard on the back and continues on his way, leaving a stunned Nick
30
-  30 Kurt somberly heads to his desk
He's wearing a dark suit
(
) Yo, dickwall
What the fuck
Kurt sees Bobby Pellit standing in the doorway of what was Jack's office
What
You're three hours late
What's the deal
was at your father's funeral
Maybe that excuse would've flown when my dad was here, but 'm in charge now
That excuse wouldn't have made any sense when your dad was here
In my office
Now
25
31
'  -   31 Kurt enters
He notices that the "Jack Pellit" nameplate has been partially taped over with the name "Bobby" scribbled in magic marker
Sit
Kurt sits
Bobby quickly slips a small mirror and rolled up dollar bill into a drawer
Kurt sees Bobby has tossed most of Jack's mementos, achievement awards and photos with luminaries in the trash
've been looking over the books
You're the accountant
Tell me why this company is in the crapper
It's not in the crapper
It's a recession
But we're still profitable
Bullshit
Look,  know you and my dad were pals
Frankly,  always thought it was weird and gay and never understood why my dad thought you were so great
But it doesn't matter now because he's in the ground and 'm your boss
And there's gonna be some changes around here
First of all
(pointing to a ) What is this `EnviroTech Waste Management' shit that we're paying so much for
Your father made the decision to pay a little more to dispose of our chemical waste responsibly
Yeah, fuck that
We've got an offer from Bolivia to dump the stuff for a third the cost
But that would endanger thousands of local residents
() 26
31 : 31 So some jungle tribesmen get cancer
Boo friggin' hoo
They're not tribesmen
It's a -- () Look, Bobby, your dad told me very clearly he'd die before he'd save money by hurting people
Well then, we're right on schedule, aren't we
Kurt's eyes narrow
He reaches into the trash can and grabs one of Jack's discarded   and its pointy end deep into Pellit's chest, impaling him in his chair
: 32   () 32 Kurt sits across from an unharmed Pellit
Oh, and we also need to trim the fat around here
(snapping out of it) What do you mean
want you to fire the fat people
They're slow and lazy and they make me sad to look at
Start with Large Marge
Margie at her desk
Margie's not fat
She's pregnant
'm not firing her
Fine
Then fire Professor Xavier over there
a balding, middle-aged man in a wheelchair, , who sits at a desk near Margie's
() 27
32 : 32 Hank
He creeps me out
Rolling around in that weird little chair of his
'm not firing anyone
It's like you don't care about this company at all
No shit
You think when  was a kid  dreamed of running a fucking chemical company
No
dreamed of retiring
Of being fed tropical fruit on a beach by a model while she blows me
And as soon as  squeeze all the profit out of this place, that's exactly what 'm gonna do
So here's the deal
You either fire the fatty or the cripple, or  fire both of them
33
-   33 Kurt sighs as he looks from Margie to Hank and back
At last, he gathers his resolve and crosses to Hank's desk
From a   we watch as Kurt breaks the news to Hank who reacts with sad resignation
Kurt turns to see Pellit standing directly beside him
(loudly, to the room) Everyone, can  have your attention please
've just learned that Kurt has fired our dear friend Hank here
want you to know that  am as surprised and angry about this as you are
What are you --
This is entirely an accounting department decision
My hands are tied
(then, to Kurt) You are one heartless bastard, Gamble
() 28
33 : 33 Pellit heads off
Hank glares at Kurt
Look, Hank, this was not my -- Fuck you, Kurt
Hank wheels away, leaving Kurt to face the angry looks of his -

-  34 Dale, dressed for work, knocks on Julia's office door
(
) Come in
35
'  -   35 Dale enters
You wanted to see -- He looks up to find Julia sitting at her desk in nothing but an unbuttoned white lab coat
( ) Oh, God
Have a seat, Dale
Do  have to
Please
He sits, then immediately stands again
Look, Julia, this is ridiculous -- (holding up hand) know what you're going to say and that's exactly what  want to talk to you about
() () 29
35 : 35 (') Yes,  like to joke around at work
And sometimes  might cross the line a bit
But the last thing  want to do is make you uncomfortable
That's unprofessional and  pride myself on being a professional
She leans back in her chair and puts her hands behind her head revealing even more of her body
So from now on,  want you to tell me when and if  cross the line
Now
Right now
What
You're naked, Julia
'm not naked
You can't even see my pussy
Okay, right there
Just saying `pussy' to me
That's over the line
That's over the line
You're starting to sound like a little faggot, Dale
Again
Naked, `pussy,' `faggot
' All over the line
And probably -- Okay, let's not start talking about illegal, Mr
Pees-on-Young- Boys
It was an empty playground
In the middle of the night
Even worse
That little boy must have been terrified
() 30
35 : (2) 35 Julia stands and moves uncomfortably close to Dale
He tries not to stare at her breasts
Let's cut to the chase
You're engaged now
And  respect the institution of marriage too much to violate it
That's why you need to fuck me well before the wedding
Because the closer it gets, the less ladylike 'm going to feel about this whole thing
'm not going to sleep with you, Julia
We'll see about that
(then, suddenly ) Startled, Dale hurries out of the office
36
'  -   36 Nick, Dale and Kurt sit miserably over their drinks
They've all had a few
feel like a total sucker
Harken was never planning on promoting me
That coked-out douchebag is gonna destroy Pellit Chemicals
She stood there with her breasts right in my face
Nick and Kurt turn to Dale
You know, yours just doesn't sound that bad
Why don't you guys quit
It's not like you're sex offenders
() 31
36 : 36 It's true
mean, 'm young could go back to school, change fields
In the b
g
, a  has noticed them
He heads over
Yeah
Why should  care about protecting Pellit's name when his own son doesn't
There's a million jobs out there
The world is your oyster
Well, well, if it isn't the Three Musketeers, Nick, Kurt and Dale
Still hanging out like high school, huh
don't believe it
Kenny Orkin
heard you moved to New York to work at Lehman Brothers or something
() did
Hired me right out of Yale
So what are you doing back here
Don't you read the papers
They shut us down

It's crazy out here

You
Waiting tables

Everyone thought you were set
Everyone including me

The three guys exchange uncomfortable looks as they reach for their wallets
Uh, sure
Here's a few bucks, Kenny
Okay, y'know that's not really gonna do it for me

What if give you guys handjobs
Forty bucks
We can do it in the bathroom right here

You're gay now
No, 'm not gay
They look skeptical

They guys look at each other with eyebrows raised
Nick mouths "opposite

Handjobs for the Three Musketeers
Let's do this
The  spots Kenny and points at him

-  37 The three guys are walking home, all mildly buzzed
So  guess we're just gonna be miserable for the rest of our lives
What do you mean
What options do we have
We can quit our jobs and turn into Kenny
Or keep our jobs and turn into sad, ball-less losers who spend their days dreaming of ways to kill their bosses
There's a beat as Nick regards Kurt
You do that too
Of course
Everyone does
It's the only thing that keeps us from going totally bat-shit
The other day  imagined shoving one of those jugs from the water cooler in Harken's mouth and making him drink until his bladder explodes
Jeez
That's so funny
had the same idea for Pellit
() () 34
37 : 37 (') Only using gasoline instead of water
And his ass instead of his mouth
You guys are sick
What's sick about it
It's just a way to let off steam
Yeah, Dale
It's not like we're actually going to kill our bosses
They continue walking
After a beat
You have to admit though, our lives would be a lot better if our bosses were dead
Well, of course
It's the one thing that keeps me from being happy
Me too
There's another beat
Let's just consider this, for one second
Consider what
Killing our bosses
'm just being hypothetical here
(laughing it off) Yeah, right
Very funny
Well, it's not like they're gonna live forever
These pieces of shit are going to die someday
() () 35
37 : (2) 37 (') We'd just be accelerating that natural process
Shut up, Kurt
Yeah, shut up, Kurt
() Frankly,  don't see any reason not to do it
Well, first of all, killing someone is illegal and immoral -- It may be illegal but 'm not sure it's immoral
Sometimes one evil person has to die for the greater good of the community
If Bobby Pellit has his way, hundreds, maybe thousands of innocent Bolivians will suffer
It would actually be immoral not to kill him
Nick begins to warm to the idea
didn't get to say goodbye to Gam Gam because of Harken
Exactly
Who knows how many other Gam Gams have died alone
can't believe you guys are actually talking about this don't care how bad our bosses are
We're not murderers
No, we're not, Dale
We're just trying to live our lives
But what are we supposed to do when someone makes it impossible for us to live our lives
Do we just bend over and take it up the ass forever
() 36
37 : (3) 37 No, we do not
What you guys are talking about is wrong and you know it
Julia's ruining your life
That's wrong
Yeah
She's not ruining my life
If anything's ruining my life it's you guys and your drunk bullshit
If it's bullshit, Dale, then how come we all want to do it so much
They reach the corner where they part ways
don't want to do it
And when you sober up neither will you
We're not killing anyone
Dale heads off
( ) was just being hypothetical
() Yeah, me too
their ambivalent looks -- 38
-   38 Dale is organizing some equipment when a pair of woman's hands suddenly cover his eyes
(
) () Guess who
() 37
38 : 38 () 'm really not in the mood for this now -- He turns and reacts as he sees it's not Julia, but his fiancee, Stacy
Stacy
Not in the mood for what
For
nothing
What are you doing here
Julia appears in her office doorway
invited her
She called and said now that we're engaged, she wanted to offer me free dental work
And you know 've had that loose filling for a while
It's so sweet of you, Julia
It's my pleasure
You're part of the family now
( ) Uhhhh
don't know if this is a good idea
Why not
We don't want to take advantage of Julia
Dale, there's nothing you could do that would be taking advantage of me
Nothing
(then, to Stacy) Now what do you say we pump you full of gas
() 38
38 : (2) 38 Julia leads Stacy into the exam room
Dale cuts them off
Wait -- no gas
She doesn't need to be out
What are you talking about, Dale
You know 'm not good with drills
() You don't want your fiancee to suffer, do you
Dale's defeated look -- : 39
-    39 Stacy lies on the chair with the nitrous mask over her nose
Julia and Dale stand beside her
( ) Ten, nine
eight
seh
And she's out
Immediately, Julia pounces on Dale, feverishly trying to unbuckle his belt
Hey
Stop it, what are you --
You're gonna give me that dong, Dale
Stacy groans softly
Dale pushes Julia away
knew you only brought her in here to mess with me
Let's have sex on top of her
Let's use her like a bed
() 39
39 : 39 Julia begins to clamber up onto Stacy's supine body
Dale pulls her off
All right, that's it, Julia
This is over
You're out of your mind
quit
He goes to turn off the gas but before he can -- 'll tell her you fucked me
What
If you don't fuck me, 'll tell her you fucked me
Tell her whatever you want
She'd never believe you
Julia opens a nearby drawer and tosses an envelope onto Stacy's chest
She already knows you're a sex offender
And once she sees these,  think she'll believe me
What is that
You remember your first week here when  replaced the crown on your second bicuspid
() Yeah
took a few snapshots of the procedure
For my files
Dale lunges at the envelope and pulls out the photos
40
40     40 -- Dale lies on the dentist chair, his eyes open and his hands behind his head with Julia at his crotch, apparently fellating him
-- Julia, now nude, straddles Dale, who is naked from the waist down on the chair
She holds one arm in the air like a rodeo cowboy
-- Julia is on the floor, her legs splayed while Dale lies limply on top of her
-- Julia is on all fours
Dale is limply draped over her back, apparently doing her doggy-style
41    41 () You
you did all this while was unconscious
Yup
How did you make it look like was awake
Taped your eyes open
This is rape
You raped me
Don't get all dramatic
Your dick wasn't hard
But it will be next time
Or else Stacy here gets a look at my photo album
She holds up the packet of photos
( ) Now, let's repair this patient's filling, shall we
Dale gapes at her, dumbstruck
41
42
'  -   42 Kurt and Nick are playing a videogame as Dale bursts through the front door
Let's kill the bitch
Huh
What bitch
My boss
Our bosses
They need to die
Nick and Kurt exchange a look
We were drunk last night, man
And didn't you say killing was wrong
That was before Julia tried to fuck me on top of my fiancee's unconscious body
Whoa
say we kill them all
Are you guys in or out
was in last night
Yes
Nick
They both turn to Nick who is uncertain
Kurt spots the photo of Nick with his  and grabs it off the wall
Look at her
Look at Bubby
Gam Gam
() 42
42 : 42 Look at Gam Gam
Getting a smooch from her favorite grandson
Little does she know that she'll never get to say goodbye to him
And why
Because his shithead boss wouldn't let him leave
What would Gam Gam want you to do
Probably not kill him
This isn't about Gam Gam
This is about you
What do you want, Nick
want him to die
Damn straight
Okay, 'm in
All right
Let's do this
() How do we do this
was thinking about that on my way over
Stacy and  watch a lot of `Law & Order' and there's a ton of ways criminals mess up
Things we'd never think of
They leave behind clothing fibers, bullet casings, hair, skin cells -- Skin cells
can't even keep track of my keys
Exactly
And that's why we need a professional
What are you talking about, a hitman
Dale nods
() 43
42 : (2) 42 You know, that's not bad
mean, we don't clean our own apartments, right
We hire someone to clean them for us
Maybe you do, moneybags
But where are we supposed to find a hitman
That's the only problem
have no idea
There's a beat
Kurt's eyes light up
do
Meet at my place tomorrow after work
And make sure you're not followed
Why would anyone follow us
don't know
People get followed
What people
Just meet me at my place
43
'  -   43 Kurt opens the door on Nick and Dale
The decor of Kurt's place is best described as a middle-income bachelor pad
Come in
The guy should be here pretty soon
Wait
You actually found someone
It was as easy as buying a used futon
() 44
43 : 43 He points to his computer
On the screen is a listing -- Craigslist
You found a hitman on Craigslist
Yup
But they don't post it as `hitman
' That would be stupid
They use code words, like `liquidation,' `pest control,' `wet work
' Check it out
This is our guy
Nick reads the listing
`Skilled professional with years of experience in domestic and international wet work
Fast and discreet
No children or political figures
' See
He's principled
This is so dangerous
What if he's a narc
Yeah, Kurt
Call him back and cancel
It's too late
He's on his way
What do we do if this guy gets here and he asks for so much money that we can't afford him and he gets mad and kills all of us
don't think he'd stay in business long if he killed everyone who couldn't afford him
(looking out window) Guys
think this is him
The others hurry to look
From -- 45
44   44 We see a black Mercedes  pull up
distinguished- looking  in a well-tailored suit steps out
He wears sunglasses and carries a briefcase
45    45 Nice car
Whoa
This guy's legit
bet that briefcase has one of those guns you have to screw together
All right, let's just be professional here
We don't want to seem all giddy
knock at the door
() How's my hair
() It doesn't matter
Kurt opens the door on the Man who looks even smoother up close
( ) Is one of you Kurt
(whispering to Nick) Oh my God, he's like James Bond
(to the Man) Yes, hi, 'm Kurt
Please come in
Thank you
Are all three of you participating in this
() 46
45 : 45 Yes, we are
Very well
Now before we go any further,  need to know if there are any hidden recording devices in this room
will find out if there are
No, no
We definitely don't want to record this, sir
Then let's get started
He walks to the middle of the living room, opens his briefcase and takes out a plastic tarp which he proceeds to unfurl over the carpet
Whoa, whoa
What's that for
For the mess
We don't want you to kill us
( ) Oh my God
knew it
Kill you
What are you talking about
The guys exchange a confused look
Your ad said you do wet work
That's correct
urinate on other men for money
/ What
Why do you think my ad was in the `men seeking men' section
() 47
45 : (2) 45 ( ) You were looking in `men seeking men'
Yeah
We're men seeking a man, aren't we
You are such a moron
So you're telling me  drove all the way to the Valley and no one wants to be pissed on
Please don't kill us
don't kill people
(then, sighing) Can  use your rest room
've stored up rather a large amount of pee for this
() It's right through there
The Man heads off
After a beat -- Good thing  didn't call the guy who was offering to do `dirty work
' 46
'  -   46 Kurt drives
Nick is in the passenger seat
Dale in back
All right, 'll take the blame for that one
That's big of you
'm going to make it up to you figured out a much better way to find a contract killer
() 48
46 : 46 What's that
Kurt reaches up and pushes a button on the rear-view mirror
male voice comes over the speaker
(
) ( ) Hello, Mr
Gamble, thank you for contacting On Star -- Oh, come on
( ) This is your plan
(
) -- my name is Gregory
How can be of service this evening
Gregory,  need you to direct me to the most dangerous bar in Los Angeles
(
) 'm sorry
We need to find the bar with the most scumbags, lowlifes and hardcore shitheads
Can you help us out
(
) 'm afraid our listings are not organized by danger, sir
do see there is a Bennigan's three blocks from your current -- Okay, Gregory
That's unhelpful
While 'm sure there are plenty of shitheads there, they're not the kind of shitheads we need
(
) can direct you to the neighborhood with the greatest number of car-jackings in your area
() 49
46 : (2) 46 Now we're talking
(
) Very good, sir
You may wish to lock your doors
Kurt and the others lock their doors
47
-    47 Kurt's car drives down a depressed-looking block
48
'  -   48 The guys are still chatting with Gregory
So, do you like living in Bangalore
(  )(
) It's not bad
Humid
Now, `Gregory
' Is that your real name
(
) No, sir
My real name is Atmanand
Atmanand
How did you get Gregory from that
(
) `Gregory' was assigned to me by On Star
Why don't they let you use your real name
(
) Many Americans find our real names off-putting
Actually,  do find Atmanand a little off-putting
() 50
48 : 48 (
) () You have arrived at your destination, sir
/ Thank you, Gregory
/Thanks, Gregory
49
-    49 Kurt's car pulls up on a grimy-looking South-Central street and stops in front of a dingy bar
The guys get out and look around warily
This must be the place
Aren't you worried about your car
Nah, Gregory's watching it
You really think we're gonna find a hitman in there
think we're gonna have a hard time deciding between all the hitmen in there
Trust me, these are the lowest of the low
50
-   50 The three guys enter the squalid, smoky place
The room is full of surly-looking , none of them white
People turn to stare
Oh, real nice, Kurt
Way to be racist
This isn't a race thing
We need a criminal and this neighborhood is where they live
'm not saying that's because there are a lot of black people here
That's the fault of our society that discriminates and disenfranchises them
() 51
50 : 50 You said they were the lowest of the low
was speaking socio-economically
So what do we do now
Yell out `anyone here kill people for money
' Let me handle this
They each take a seat at the bar where a no-nonsense walks over to them
Yeah
Hey
How you doing
Nice place
( ) Listen, does anyone here kill people for money
Kurt
An intense-looking  on the next stool notices them
The fuck did you just say
Don't get me wrong
This isn't about race
Our society discriminates and disenfranchises -- (head in hands) Oh my God
'm a small business owner
Who are you calling disenfranchised
didn't mean you in particular
Right
You mean all black people
() 52
50 : (2) 50 Maybe we should go
You could do that
Or  could take the aluminum baseball bat 'm holding in my right hand and disenfranchise your teeth from your mouth
vote we go
The three stand and head for the door
Okay, we're going
'm sorry if offended you
It was never my -- Oh shit, please shut up
Okey doke
51
-   51 The guys come out onto the sidewalk
This is ridiculous
We're never gonna find someone to do this for us
(
) Yo
They turn to see  , 30s, the guy who was sitting next to them at the bar
think  can help you boys
He gestures for them to follow him into the alley beside the bar
Kurt and Nick move to follow
Oh, we're just gonna follow him into that alley
All right
52
-   52 Cocksucker Jones leans in to the three guys
() 53
52 : 52 heard you're looking for someone to take care of some business for you
Yes, we are
Are you a
businessman
(putting out his ) Cocksucker Jones
(unsure whether to take his hand) Excuse me
That's my name
Your first name is Cocksucker
And my last name's Jones
You got a problem with that
No, no
It's just interesting
That's the name on your birth certificate
Naw, man
It's a nickname
My real name is Dean
Oh
Like Dean Jones
The actor from Herbie the Love Bug
(quietly to Dale) don't think he knows who Dean Jones is
know who Dean Jones is, bitch
can't walk around here with that kind of faggy, cracker name
So you chose `cocksucker'
() 54
52 : (2) 52 That's right
Nobody fucks with a cocksucker
`Cocksucker' is the toughest name there is
Not `motherfucker'
considered Motherfucker
But in the end,  thought Cocksucker Jones sounded more badass than Motherfucker Jones
agree
Okay, here's the thing: we each work for a boss that we need to get rid of
Is that something you might be able to help us with
It is
Assuming you've got the cheese
We've got cheese
How much cheese are we talking
For three hits
That's gonna run you thirty large
That's a lot of cheese
We don't have that much cheese
Isn't there any kind of discount because we're buying three at once
Like buy two, get one free
This ain't the motherfucking Cold Stone Creamery
It's thirty large or nothing
There's no way we can pay that
() 55
52 : (3) 52 Five large
Wow
( ) Good negotiating
That's a lot more reasonable
And that would be for all three, Cocksucker
Yeah
Great
We're in
Okay, meet me back here tomorrow night with the cash
'll take care of the rest
Should we bring the bills in any kind of special denominations
No, just, whatever
Small bills
Got it
And do you want it in any particular container, like a shoebox
Or a paper bag
Or plastic
read an article that plastic is actually better for the environment than paper
Fuck the environment
Just put that shit in a briefcase
Got it
Thanks
Come on, guys
They turn to go, when Dale turns back
() 56
52 : (4) 52 Should we deduct the cost of the briefcase
What
mean, assuming we don't get the case back
We're not getting the case back, right
Cocksucker glares at him
Well, that's like an extra eighty bucks
Only seems fair that we should take that out of your end
We'll cover the briefcase, Dale
Then let's get a cheap one
It doesn't have to be real leather
(then to Cocksucker) Are you cool with faux --
Kurt grabs Dale by the shoulder and hustles him to the car
: 53    53 : Frank Sinatra's "(Forget Your Troubles, Come On) Get Happy" -- Dale, Kurt and Nick each take a turn at an machine, withdrawing the maximum amount they can
-- Nick at his desk at work
He looks over his cubicle wall and his eyes narrow as he sees Harken directing a who stencils the words "Senior Vice President of Sales" below where it already says "President
" Another uses a sledgehammer on the wall of the office
Nick grins malevolently
-- Kurt is at his desk in the chemical company
He looks up to see Bobby Pellit open his office door and lead out two obvious
Pellit has white powder around his nostrils
He spots Kurt watching him and he sneers back
Kurt smiles devilishly
() 57
53 : 53 --   Dale as he places tooth -rays into plastic contact sheets
to reveal Julia is licking his neck while tweaking his nipples through his scrubs
In contrast to earlier, Dale appears to be unfazed and almost amused by Julia's antics
54
-   54 Cocksucker Jones holds an open briefcase that's empty but for a single stack of taped together 20-dollar bills
Looks like it's all here
Turns out we didn't really need the briefcase after all
Could've just used a manila envelope
Shut up, Dale
So, Cocksucker, how long do you think it'll be before you've
taken care of business
Here's the thing
just got out of doing a dime for some pretty ugly shit and 'm still on probation
They're watching me
So if  step out of line,  go right back inside
You told us you could take care of it
And 'm gonna
'm gonna be your professional advisor
Think of me as your murder consultant
We don't want a murder consultant
We want a murderer
knew we were getting ripped off
Okay, look
This isn't what we talked about
() () 58
54 : 54 (') Can we just get our money back, please
Then we'll be on our way
Sorry, no refunds
That's five thousand dollars
You think we're just gonna walk away and let you keep that
(getting in his face) think you're forgetting who you're talking to
Cocksucker pulls back the lower edge of his jacket to reveal what appears to be the holster of a gun
Whoa, whoa
We don't want any trouble
Now either  give you the advice you paid for, or you can walk away with nothing
Up to you
Look, the whole reason we came to you is because we don't have the experience to do it ourselves
Most killers are first-timers
Look, the key to a good murder is making it look like an accident
Gas leak, brakes failing, suicide, that sort of thing
If you do it right, you won't even have to be there when it goes down
That makes sense
But how would we fake three accidents
You need to stalk your prey, track their movements, get to know them inside and out
Where do they go
What do they eat for breakfast
Who're they fucking
() 59
54 : (2) 54 You're talking about surveillance and recon
But making it look like an accident won't be enough if the pigs can pin a motive on you
Well, we all have obvious motives for killing our bosses
So why don't you kill each other's bosses
Hey, that's a good idea
Like Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train
The Danny DeVito movie
Yes, the famous Alfred Hitchcock/Danny DeVito movie
You're thinking of Throw Mama from the Train
But it's actually the same idea
If we kill each other's bosses there's no link to us
That's pretty good
That's what you're paying me for
Now ain't that worth five grand
The guys all   "no's
" Yeah, well, too fucking bad
55
'  -   55 Nick is poring over a stack of documents when his phone rings
: 60
56
'  -   56 Kurt and Dale wait in the car outside of Nick's office
We're outside
You ready for a little recon
Yeah
just need to get Harken to let me leave early
What's the difference
He's not going to be your boss much longer
() If  get fired before we kill Harken, this'll all have been for nothing
'll just be an out-of- work murderer
() 'll be down in three minutes
He hangs up then peers over his cubicle wall to see Harken talking to another  nearby
Nick takes a breath, leans over his garbage pail and sticks a Commtronix pen down his throat
At the sound of Nick's loud , Harken looks over to see him puking into the trash pail
What in God's name
() Sorry, sir
've been fighting this bug all day
'll just get back to work -- Nick wipes his mouth and turns pathetically back to his desk
No
Go home
don't want you getting everyone else sick
Oh, okay
Thank you, Mr
Harken
Nick grabs his jacket and moves to go
() 61
56 : 56 Wait
Take your work with you
Have it on my desk at six
Nick barely conceals his contempt as he picks up the stack of papers and heads out
() Disgusting
57
'  -   57 Kurt's car pulls up slowly and parks
Kurt, Dale and Nick slump down in their seats
58
'  -   58 Okay, boys, as soon as Pellit makes a move, we tail him
It is on now
Oh, it's on
Hells yeah
They watch the house with steely determination
: 59
'  -    59 The guys are bored out of their minds, barely awake
Dale nibbles on a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in a plastic bag
Ugghhhhh,  can't believe how much this sucks
don't get it
On , surveillance always looks so great
They've got their cups of coffee
Their sunflower seeds
They talk about their lives
() () 62
59 : 59 (') And then, right when they reveal something really intimate, the perp appears and they spring into action
long, silent pause as they watch the house
Are we even sure he's home
They exchange looks
(opening his door) Let's go check it out
They get out of the car
Dale pockets his sandwich
60
'  -   60 The three guys creep around Pellit's patio, peeking in doors and windows
Finally: don't see him
Kurt is about to try a window when Dale stops him
What are you doing
We're not gonna get intel standing on his lawn
We have to go in
What about fingerprints
We don't have gloves
Here, do this
Kurt pulls his shirt sleeves down over his hands
Dale does the same
Nick, who wears a -shirt, tucks his hands inside the bottom of the shirt
With some difficulty, Kurt slides open the window
Here we go
The three of them manage to wriggle through the window
It's not graceful: Dale's foot gets caught on the sill, causing him to tumble on top of Nick and Kurt
At last, all three are inside
63
61
'   -   61 Dale, keep an eye out
Let us know if Pellit's coming
Got it
Wait,  don't know what he looks like
It doesn't matter
Just tell us if anyone comes
Got it
They take in Pellit's living room
There's a leather sofa, a 60-inch plasma and enormous speakers
On the wall are framed Ed Hardy posters depicting dragons and half-naked girls
Wow
This guy's a bigger douchebag than me
Okay, let's split up
Look for any intel we can use on him
What kind of intel
don't know
guess we'll know it when we see it
Kurt heads upstairs while Dale and Nick look around the living room
Hey, Nick
Does this count as intel
Nick looks over to see Dale holding in his sleeve-covered hands an open wooden box filled with white powder
Holy shit, that's a lot of blow
God, this must be worth, like, ten thousand -- oh shit
() 64
61 : 61 Suddenly, the box slips out of Dale's hands
It hits the floor, sending a cascade of cocaine all over the rug
What the fuck
Sorry, my sleeves were slippery
We've got to get that back in the box
've got it
He kneels and begins trying to scoop up the coke in his hands
It's an impossible task
62
'  -   62 Kurt looks around the room
He doesn't see anything useful so he heads into -- 63
'  -   63 He flips on the light
His eyes land on Pellit's toothbrush
He grins slyly
64
'   -   64 Dale is still on his knees, scooping up coke, as Nick returns from the kitchen cradling a Dustbuster in his - shirt
Look out
Let me try this
Struggling with his hands in his -shirt, Nick vacuums up the cocaine from the rug
When he's finished, he pops open the vacuum's waste receptacle and dumps the contents back in the wooden box
65     65 Which is now filled not only with cocaine, but bits of hair, dust bunnies, food and other crap
65
66    66 guess we should've emptied the Dustbuster before we used it
You think
67
'  -   67 Just  , Kurt removes Pellit's toothbrush from his ass and returns it to its holder, careful to keep his hands covered with his sleeves
He's about to go when he notices a bar of Neutrogena face soap beside the sink
He looks around deviously
68
'   -   68 Dale and Nick are doing their best to pick the crap out of Pellit's cocaine
Hey look, there's a piece of cereal in here
Can't tell if that's a corn flake or a frosted flake
Kurt comes down the stairs
Okay, my work upstairs is done
You guys ready to split
69
'  -   69 Kurt pulls away from the curb
We need to be better prepared
That was totally dangerous and a complete waste of time
Not a complete waste
He pulls a BlackBerry out of his pocket
Oh no
don't tell me
() 66
69 : 69 You stole that from Pellit's house
It's got his calendar and his contacts
This is what recon's all about
() Nobody said we'd be stealing
Shall we pay a little visit to your boss, Nick
guess so
But let's make a stop first
70
-  -   70 Nick emerges from the store with a plastic bag and gets into Kurt's car
71
'  -   71 What did you need to get
Nick holds up a box of latex gloves
No more sleeve gloves
Nice
Oh man, you should've asked me
've got a whole box of those in my bedside table
(off their grossed- ) Don't judge me
Take a right up here
Harken's place is about a mile away
They drive for a beat
Then -- () 67
71 : 71 'know
this is kinda,  don't know
exciting
Very
(a little smile) Yeah
() guess we're really doing this now, huh
() guess so
72
'  -    72 two-story house with a tidy yard
Kurt's car pulls up
73
'  -   73 Kurt and Nick begin pulling on their gloves
Can  have a pair
You know, last time with the three of us, it got a little
messy
What if Kurt and  go in and you stay here and watch out for Harken
Okay -- again,  don't know what he looks like
If anyone approaches the house, assume it's him and give us a signal
Fine
'll honk the horn six times
Maybe something a little more subtle
() 68
73 : 73 Honk the horn four times
How about you just honk once
People honk once all the time
You'll be running in and out of the house
Fine
Honk twice
() Okay
Nick and Kurt get out of the car
After a beat, Dale remembers his sandwich and pulls it out of his pocket
74
'  -   74 Kurt and Nick sneak up to the front porch which is camouflaged by shrubs
They peek inside
() Looks like the coast is clear
Kurt tries the windows
They're locked
Damn
Guess we'll have to break in the old-fashioned way
Kurt looks around and spots a small rock beside the porch
He picks it up and winds back to throw it at the window
Kurt, wait
But it's too late
Kurt has released the rock
It the window, but instead of breaking the glass, the rock itself  into two pieces
Holy shit
broke the rock
No, it's one of those hide-a-key things
Look
() 69
74 : 74 Nick shows Kurt a key concealed in one half of the fake rock
He grabs it and inserts it into the front door lock
75
'   -   75 The guys tiptoe in, whispering and tense
The place is tastefully decorated with attractive furniture and modern art
There is a vase of flowers on a table
Wow
This is not how  pictured his place
For all we know, he's got a closet full of skin suits
springs out of nowhere, startling them, then runs off
Jesus
Stupid cat
() Let's check upstairs
They head up
76
'  -   76 Dale is finishing the last of his peanut butter sandwich
He checks the rearview mirror
No sign of anyone
(singing a la Cher, - ) `Do you believe in love after love/ can feel something inside me say/ really don't think you're strong enough now
' 77
'  -   77 Just as Kurt and Nick enter, the cat suddenly jumps out from behind the door, startling them again
() 70
77 : 77 God damn it
How many cats do they have
think that was the same one
Little bastard
Kurt notices a framed wedding photo on the dresser of Harken and Mrs
Harken
Damn
That's Mrs
Harken
'd like to cover her in cock yogurt
You want to cover every woman in
did you say `cock yogurt'
did
Yet again, Kurt and Nick jump as the cat  out of hiding with a  then runs off
Ahhh
If he's so scared of us, why doesn't he just leave us alone
78
'  -   78 Dale plays a bowling game on his cell phone
'mon, c'mon
yes
breeze blows through the open windows of the car, catching the plastic bag from Dale's sandwich and carrying it out the window
79
'  -   79 Just then, Harken, in running attire, comes jogging up the street
His eye is caught by the plastic bag falling from the car window onto the street
He stops and angrily picks up the bag
() 71
79 : 79 Hey, schmuck
Dale, surprised, turns to the window
Excuse me
You want to tell me why you're littering on my street
Oh, 'm sorry, that blew out the window
wasn't littering
don't care if it blew out of your twat
Now, get your fucking Chevy Cavalier the hell off my block
Whoa
Sir, there's no need to be hostile
Hostile
You want to see hostile
How about  go in the house and get my -- Suddenly, Harken begins to choke and his face grows increasingly red
Get your what
With one hand Harken grabs his throat and with the other he looks at the plastic bag he's holding
() Peanuts
Huh
Oh, yeah
It was a peanut butter sandwich
Harken collapses to his knees
His face is turning blue now
Dale quickly steps out of the car
Oh god
What should  do
Tell me what to do
() 72
79 : (2) 79 Harken yanks up the right leg of his jogging pants revealing an - strapped to his ankle
He reaches for it, but Dale moves faster
What do  do with this
Should inject you
Harken nods urgently as his eyes begin to roll back
Okay, hold on
got this
Dale takes the cap off the epi-pen, raises his arm and jams the needle into Harken's chest
Harken lets out a grunt
Did  do it
Did  get enough in
'm gonna do it again
Dale raises his arm again
80
'  -   80 Nick continues to search around the bedroom
Kurt is by the window
Do you see a Day Runner or an address book
-- (glances out the ) What the
Dude, check this out
Nick joins him at the window and they both react as they see what appears to be Dale repeatedly  Harken in the chest, neck and arms
Harken lies motionless on the sidewalk
() That's Harken
Dale's killing Harken
Holy shit
He's really doing it
() Out where everyone can see him
() 73
80 : 80 What the hell is he thinking
He's not stopping
He's gonna get us all caught
We've gotta get out of here
What about Dale
He's a psychopath
We leave him behind
Right
Let's go through the back
As they hurry to leave the room, Kurt stumbles over the which has appeared yet again
Unseen by either of them, '   out of his pocket and lands on the floor at the foot of Harken's bed
81
'  -   81 As Dale kneels over Harken to check his breathing, a car pulls up alongside and
steps out
Seeing her husband on the ground, she rushes over
Oh my god
What happened
He had an allergic reaction
But think he's coming around
Do you know him
He's my husband
Mrs
Harken kneels beside Harken and supports his head
Honey
Can you hear me
Harken groggily looks down at his torso which is perforated by dozens of tiny needle marks
(groggy, to Dale) Wha-- What did you do to me
injected you with your thing
() 74
81 : 81 He saved your life, honey
( ) Thank you so much
She grabs Dale in a warm hug
Oh, it was nothing
(to Mrs
Harken) What's this
What's with the hugging
'm just thankful that he was here
'll bet you are
Do you know this guy
No
We just -- Are you fucking him, Rhonda
Oh, come on
( ) What were you doing out here, anyway
Waiting to fuck my wife
() 've never met your wife -- Still a bit woozy, Harken gets to his feet and points at Dale
You need to get the hell out of here
Dave, stop it
You should be thanking him
Why are you being so suspicious
() 75
81 : (2) 81 Why
Because  know you sleep around on me
And 'm going to find out who it is
You're being ridiculous
Am
What about Maurilio
see the way you look at him
am not having sex with the gardener
As Harken and his wife continue to bicker, Dale quietly retreats to Kurt's car
82
'  -  82 Nick and Kurt pace nervously
can't believe that idiot Dale
You realize we're all going to jail because of him
can't go to jail
Look at these eyes
Look at this ass
They'll be all over me
Yeah, me too
( ) Well
What do you mean `well'
'd get raped just as much as you
() No, of course you would
You're a good-looking guy
You think you're more rape-able than  am
() 76
82 : 82 never said that -- Dale enters
Oh good
You guys are here
Did you see me out there
Yeah, Dale, we saw you
Pretty neat, huh
No, it wasn't neat
You stabbed Harken to death in front of the whole neighborhood
Not cool, man
Wait, that was Harken
Who'd you think you were stabbing
wasn't stabbing anybody
That was an epi-pen
He was having an allergic reaction to peanuts and injected him
Kurt and Nick digest this for a beat
So let me understand this
My boss, who we are trying to kill, was dying in front of you and you saved his life
Not cool, man
Wait, you were just mad at me for killing him and now you're mad at me for not killing him
() See, this is why  needed to know what these people look like
() 77
82 : (2) 82 Hang on a sec
Maybe this recon wasn't a waste of time
Now we know Harken's deathly allergic to peanuts and Pellit has a huge stash of cocaine
( ) We could put peanuts in Harken's house and rat poison in Pellit's coke
Everyone would assume that Pellit just got a batch of tainted drugs
But Harken must always have that epi-pen on him
They consider this for a beat
bet he doesn't wear it in the shower
We could put peanuts in his shampoo
Perfect
Two fatal accidents
And we're not even there when they happen
That just leaves Julia
Tomorrow night, 'll surveil her and figure out how to take her down
Good
'll get some rat poison and take care of Pellit
Dale, think you can get some peanuts into Harken's shampoo
can do that
All right
That just leaves us with one final thing to settle
() 78
82 : (3) 82 What's that
Dale, if Nick and  were in prison, which one of us would get raped more
Dale's confusion and Nick's annoyance -- 83
'  -   83 Nick sits in his parked car watching the house through binoculars
84
'  -   84 Through an upstairs window, he sees Pellit enter his bedroom
Nick checks his coat pocket and confirms it contains a Home Depot bag with rat poison inside
Nick dials his cell phone
: 85
'  -   85 Kurt sits in his car, reading Maxim magazine
Julia's car pulls up
She gets out, goes to the trunk, opens it, then bends down to get a bag of groceries
Nick watches her ass appreciatively as she does and keeps watching as she heads into her building
: His cell phone rings
( ) Hey
Have you learned anything about Julia yet
Well, 've learned that Dale is a homosexual because this chick is unbelievably hot
How's it going over there
'm just waiting for Pellit to go to sleep
wonder how Dale's doing with Harken
79
86
'  -   86 Dale's car is parked
87
'  -   87 Dale watches the movie Precious on his laptop
He glances over to see Harken turn on the light in his bedroom
On the seat beside Dale, we see a large jar of Planters peanuts
88
'  -   88 Harken looks around suspiciously, then goes to Mrs
Harken's closet
He opens it and begins looking through her clothing
He sniffs one of her dresses and his eyes narrow
He sniffs himself, then compares it to the smell of the dress
Unsatisfied, he continues searching around the room for any incriminating evidence
Suddenly, his foot comes in contact with something on the floor
He reaches down and picks up
'
He turns it on and scrolls down the contacts list to "" which shows Bobby Pellit's name and address
Harken's face turns beet red
89
'  -   89 Dale ducks down as he sees Harken's garage door opening
Harken's Porsche 911 pulls out and zooms up the street
Still scooched down, Dale dials his phone
90
'  -   90 Nick watches Pellit performing a series of sweaty in a full-length mirror
Jesus, where does he get the energy
() Oh yeah
Nick answers
What's up, Dale
() 80
90 : 90 Harken just left his house
'm going in
Good luck, man
Thanks
91
'  -   91 Dale flips on the light and enters clutching the peanut jar in his gloved hands
He slides open the shower curtain and Harken's    at him
Ahhh
He regains his composure and finds a bottle of men's shampoo
As he nervously removes the cap from the shampoo and the lid from the peanuts, he notices that
is  right at him
Despite his jaunty top hat and little monocle, there is something almost accusing in his look
Dale stares back at Mr
Peanut as we see his resolve soften
92
'  -   92 Nick watches as Pellit finally gets into bed and turns off his bedside lamp
Okay
Here we go
Nick reaches for the door handle as -- : Nick's cell phone rings
Nick jumps, then answers the phone
: 93
'  -   93 ( ) Nick
What
() 81
93 : 93 'm not sure if  can do this
Where are you
In Harken's bathroom
About to pour the nuts in his shampoo
But,  just
know he's a real shithead, but he's still a person, y'know
Lights appear in Nick's rearview mirror
(looking down at the rat poison, ) Yeah
know
Harken's Porsche pulls up and stops just behind Nick's car
Harken gets out and heads toward Pellit's front door
What should  do
Should  do it
Suddenly, Nick looks up to see  knocking on Pellit's door
In the bedroom, Pellit's light goes on
() What the fuck
What
It's Harken
He's here
At Pellit's
Why
don't know
He's knocking on his door
How would Harken even know Pellit
82
94
'  -   94 Looking irritated, Pellit answers the door
Before he can get a word out
Harken removes a gun from his pocket and Pellit twice in the chest
95
'  -   95 Nick reacts, slumping down in his seat, horrified
Oh my god oh my god oh my god
What
What
What
He shot him
Harken shot Pellit
Oh my god
Is he dead
Shhhh
With shaking hands, Nick reaches for his ignition but knocks the car keys out
They fall onto the floor of the car
() Fuck
As Nick bends down to find his keys, Harken's shadow looms over him
Nick cowers just out of sight
96
'  -   96 Harken looks around
Did he hear something
No
He calmly but briskly walks away from Nick's car, gets into his own and speeds off
97
'  -   97 What's happening
Harken's gone
() 83
97 : 97 What about Pellit
He's not moving
He looks dead
Shit
What do we do
've got to get out of here before someone sees me
Meet me at the bar
'll call Kurt
Nick  away from the curb
98
-   98 Nick's car  through a red light at an intersection
as it snaps Nick's photo and license plate
99
'  -    99 With trembling hands, Nick and Dale take deep gulps of their drinks
Kurt hurries in, looking disheveled
The ensuing conversation is conducted in tense whispers
Okay, let's all stay calm and figure this out
Calm
How can we be calm watched a man die an hour ago
man you were going to kill anyway
Well
What
don't know if  had it in me
Me neither
() 84
99 : 99 can't believe you guys
You can't just bail on a plan like that at the last minute
You think when it came down to it, you would've been able to murder Julia
Kurt softens
don't know
mean, afterwards, it was kind of hard to imagine killing her
Nick and Dale turn to him, quizzically
`Afterwards'
Kurt realizes what he said
You slept with her, didn't you
( ) Oh god
Please tell me you didn't sleep with her
Kurt lowers his head
You are a mess
know,  know
But it's not my fault
: 100  -
'  -  100 Kurt's car is parked across the street
(
) At first  was surveilling her just like  was supposed to
85
101
'  -  101 Kurt watches through her bedroom window as Julia undresses sexily
(
) Then she started deliberately undressing in front of the window
With the lights on
She must've known  was there
As Julia removes her bra, we see Kurt's face pressed against his car window, his breath fogging it up
102
'  -  102 Julia enters her bedroom with a tray of food
She wears a skimpy kimono-style robe
She sits on her bed and unwraps a Popsicle
(
) Then she made herself a little snack
Popsicle
We see Julia eat the Popsicle as suggestively as humanly possible
Then she picks up a banana and peels it
(
) then a banana
Julia eases the whole banana into her mouth
Then she picks up a hot dog
(
) and finally a hot dog mean, three penis-shaped foods cannot be coincidence
And in that weird order
That's not a proper meal
103
'  -    103 (
) So you took that as an invitation to fuck her
Julia opens her front door, stares straight at Kurt and beckons him inside with one finger
She walks back inside, leaving the door wide open
(
) No
took her invitation to fuck her as an invitation to fuck her
() 86
103 : 103 Kurt opens his car door so quickly he tumbles out headfirst, planting his face on the street
He jumps up, but one ankle is tangled in the seatbelt
He finally extricates himself and hurries to the house as fast as he can
104
'  -   () 104 There is something clinically wrong with you
know
'm a rapscallion
You're not a rapscallion
You're a whore
filthy whore
Hey
Not nice
And besides, think  actually solved your problem, Dale
Julia just needed a good fucking
bet she's not going to mess with you anymore
Whatever
We have bigger fish to fry right now
What do we do about Harken
Here's what we do
We call the cops and make an anonymous tip that Harken killed Pellit
Boom
Harken's in jail
Pellit's in hell
Julia's had the crazy fucked out of her
Our problems are solved
Boom
Okay, but we should find a payphone
We don't want them tracing the call to us
105
'  -   105 Nick, Kurt and Dale emerge from the bar
Come on, we'll take my car
The three of them climb into Nick's car
87
106
'  -   106 Before Nick can even pull out of his parking spot, they hear the  of a police siren and see the flashing lights of a   behind them
The guys' faces go white
What the hell
Nick unrolls his window as one  approaches his side and his  comes up on the other
Are you the owner of this vehicle
Uh, yes
Is there something wrong
We've got an  on a black Kia Spectra, license 4HIG208
Can  ask why
traffic cam caught this vehicle fleeing the scene of a crime tonight
'm going to need you to follow us to the station
Officer
This is not my car
Is it okay if  just --
All three of you, please
Nick glares at Kurt as the cops head back to their car
107
-  107 Kurt, Nick and Dale sit in a waiting area looking equal parts terrified and pissed at each other
Throughout the following, they speak in hushed voices
They know everything
We're dead
can't believe  let you guys talk me into this
() 88
107 : 107 Oh, please
We were just being hypothetical
You're the one who pushed us to do it
We can't even say anything about Harken now
Why not
Uh, well, Kurt, being outside the murder victim's house because was planning to murder him probably isn't the best alibi in the world
You know,  didn't actually do anything illegal, so
You broke into two people's houses and stole a BlackBerry
You gonna rat on me, Dale
Well, since 'm the only one without a connection to the murder, yeah, maybe  will
That means you'd also rat on me
Not if  rat on Dale first
Just then, a burly detective, , appears behind them
Gentlemen, this way, please
The guys glare angrily at each other as they follow Hagan
108
-   108 Nick, Dale and Kurt sit on metal chairs across a table from Hagan and his equally burly partner,
Hagan slides a  across the table to Nick
89
109          109 taken by the traffic camera
His terrified face is clear, as is the time stamp at the bottom
110    110 Do you want to explain why you were driving 61 in a 25 zone, a block from the victim's house two minutes after he was shot to death
was drag racing
(off their skeptical ) am a drag racer
There's no law against that, is there
Actually there is
You were drag racing in a Kia Spectra
don't win a lot
Here's what  don't understand
You're at the crime scene
An hour later when we find your car, you just happen to be hanging out with this guy
(gestures to Dale) a registered sex offender -- (: ) Tsk tsk
and this guy
(gestures at Kurt and holds up a wallet) whose employee  says he works for Pellit Chemicals, the victim's company
() 90
110 : 110 ( ) Wait
My boss was murdered
Bobby Pellit
() You want me to get you a Kleenex
can't believe this
( ) What were you doing near his house
Nick looks at him, pissed
Where were you during the murder
was making love
() `Making love
' (to the cops) Let me ask you something, Detective
Let's say one of us knew who the shooter was and was willing to hand you that perp on a platter
Would he be entitled to some sort of immunity for that information
Both Dale and Nick shoot daggers at him
No
But he would be entitled to some sort of jail time
Because if he knew who the shooter was and didn't tell us, that would be obstruction of justice
beat
Well, then 'm glad we have no idea who the shooter is, right, guys
() 91
110 : (2) 110 ( ) If you expect us to believe this is all just a big coincidence, we're going to be here for a long time
Okay wait
Now it's Kurt and Nick who look nervous
Is Dale about to crack
Saying that we'll be here for a long time implies that we can't leave
Does that mean we're under arrest
Samson looks to Hagan who grimaces
No
We just brought you in for questioning
So, you don't have evidence constituting probable cause to arrest us
Not yet
Well then, we're free to go
Technically
Dale nervously stands up, half expecting to be hit
Come on, guys
Kurt and Nick, impressed and relieved, stand and head out
111
-   111 The three guys head for the exit
() 92
111 : 111 ( ) Nice work
Where'd that come from
`Law & Order
' We really showed those guys
`We'
You were gonna turn us in
For, like, a second
(
) Stop
The guys turn to see Samson holding out a traffic citation
(handing it to Nick) For speeding and running a red light
() Don't get too comfortable out there, boys
Our forensics team is sweeping Pellit's house for fingerprints and
And they don't miss much
We   Kurt's face and -- : 112  -
'  -  112 Kurt pulls Pellit's toothbrush out of his butt and returns it to its holder
113    () 113 Kurt suddenly looks nauseous
114
'  -   114 Kurt drives, Nick is in front and Dale in back
() 93
114 : 114 We are so fucked
Maybe it's time to lawyer up
don't have money for a lawyer
gave all my money to Cocksucker Jones
Hey, that's right
forgot all about Cocksucker
Why don't we ask him what to do
We did pay him five thousand dollars to be our murder consultant
Actually, it was five thousand forty with the briefcase
their looks -- : 115
-    115 Cocksucker Jones looks up from his bar stool, surprised to see Nick, Kurt and Dale
Oh damn, look who's back
How did it go with the Strangers on a Train shit
Not great
We need your help
One of our intended victims killed another of our intended victims
Cocksucker's eyes go wide
Shut the fuck up
What kind of evil geniuses are you
() 94
115 : 115 We don't even know why it happened
But the cops brought us in as suspects
What do we do now
First things first
'm gonna need another five thousand dollars
What
No way
You said the last five thousand would cover this
Okay, fine
Pay for my drink
As Nick puts down a few bills on the bar, Dale leans in to Kurt
() Not the best negotiator, is he
Let me ask you this -- the guy who killed the other guy you were planning on killing, are the police after him too
No
They don't suspect him
All right, so you're gonna need to encourage him to turn himself in, by say, kidnapping his wife and mailing him her earlobe or something
That's horrible
Naw, the earlobe's vestigial
(off their looks) All right, how about you trick him into confessing what he did while you wear a wire
wire
That's good
() 95
115 : (2) 115 ( ) Is that how the cops caught you when you murdered someone
What the hell are you talking about
never murdered anyone
There's a beat
What
Who told you  killed somebody
You did
You said you served a `dime' for `some pretty ugly shit
' It was ugly
What was it
( ) You ever see the movie Snow Falling on Cedars
/ No
Yes
got caught with a video camera making a bootleg copy of that movie
You did ten years for video piracy
Hey, that's a federal offense
They take that shit serious
() also made the mistake of representing myself at trial
May have insulted a few of the jurors
() 96
115 : (3) 115 Hold on
You're telling me we've been taking murder advice from someone whose biggest crime was taping an Ethan Hawke movie
So you do know it
If you're not a murderer, why do you carry that gun on your belt
Gun
He pulls back his jacket to reveal the holster we saw earlier
This is a motherfucking iPhone
He pulls the phone out and shows them
feel like such a moron
Well, you are a moron
You don't walk into a bar and hand a guy five thousand dollars just because he's black
Come on, guys
Let's get out of here
The three of them turn to go
(calling after them) Trust me on the wire thing, though
Worked for Donnie Brasco
Bootlegged that movie too
116
-   116 Hagan and Samson pull up in their car and get out
117
-   117 The detectives enter to find a   leaning over his computer
() 97
117 : 117 You got something for us
We didn't find any foreign prints in the house, but we did get a match for one of your suspects, Kurt Gamble
Where was it
Pellit's upstairs bathroom
His toothbrush
It had traces of Gamble's fecal matter
That sick bastard
That's not all
We found feces on Pellit's hairbrush, face soap, floss and razor
Razor
The handle
Not the blade
This Gamble guy put just about everything in that bathroom up his ass
All  care about is that it puts him inside the house
That's enough for a warrant for him and his drag racing, sex offender friends
(takes out cell) 'll call the
118
'  -   118 Kurt's car pulls up with the lights off and parks
119
'  -   119 Kurt is at the wheel, Nick sits shotgun, Dale in back
() 98
119 : 119 Okay, looks quiet
Is the tape recorder ready
Dale pulls out a mini-tape recorder and hands it to Nick along with a roll of surgical tape
Fresh batteries, fresh six-hour tape, voice activated
One of us needs to tape it to our chest
'll do it
'm the only one without hair on my chest
That's `cause you shave it
don't shave it
wax it
Nick gives Kurt the recorder and Kurt tapes it to his chest then lowers his shirt
So what do we do now
Wait for Harken to come home and ambush him
have a better idea
Let's be in the house when he walks in
He'll be so mad, he'll be more likely to confess
Right
We'll sit there in the dark till he comes in, and then switch on a lamp
That'll freak him out
Hey, we should find an office chair so one of us can dramatically spin around and face Harken
'll be in the chair
() 99
119 : (2) 119 Why do you get to be the guy in the chair
He's my boss
We could try and find more than one office chair so the three of us can spin around at the same time
That doesn't sound intimidating
That sounds like a musical number
guess you're right
'll turn on the lamp
So 'm just supposed to stand there like an idiot
You're recording it all
You're the most important member of the team
Don't patronize me, Nick
120
'  -   120 The guys tiptoe onto the porch, peeking in the windows
Nick tries the front door
and it swings open
They look at each other, then quietly head inside
121
'  -   121 The  suddenly come on
Surprise
There are 20 or 30  in the house which is decorated for a birthday party
The guys stand dumbstruck
The revelry peters out as the guests realize there are three strangers at the door
Mrs
Harken steps up
() 100
121 : 121 Who are you
Uh
hi
sorry we're late
'm Nick
work with your husband -- ( ) Aren't you the young man who helped Dave on the street the other day
Uh, yes
How's he doing
He's fine
Thanks to you
(then, to Nick) Did  invite you to this
Before Nick can answer a  at the window calls out
#1 His car just turned the corner
#2 Someone get the lights
As everyone scurries to hide, Kurt finds himself pressed up against Mrs
Harken, beside the sofa
He checks her out
(shaking her hand) Hi, we didn't formally meet
'm Kurt
() Hi
Nick didn't tell me that his boss was married to a model
(noticing him now, ) 'm not a model
("") When did you quit
() 101
121 : (2) 121 We see Mrs
Harken is intrigued
Just then, the front door opens and Harken enters
The lights come on
Surprise
jittery Harken nearly jumps out of his skin as the crowd starts singing "Happy Birthday
" Mrs
Harken takes Harken's arm
Were you surprised
() Oh, yeah
Look, everyone's here
() Almost everyone
Who are you talking about
think you know
() need to put my stuff away
'll be right back
He heads off to his study, leaving his confused wife
She notices Kurt, standing at the buffet, staring at her
He smiles and winks
Mrs
Harken gives him a little wave
122   ,    122 He's going off alone
This is our chance
You guys ready
(still staring at Mrs
Harken) So fucking ready
Okay, stay close
() 102
122 : 122 ( ) Gotcha
The three of them head toward the study
123
'  -   123 Just as Nick and Dale enter, Harken looks up and sees them
What the hell are you doing here
( ) You come to stab me a few more times, you lunatic
( ) And my wife invited you
Are you fucking her too
Nick tries his best to suppress his nervousness and be cool and threatening
We know what you did, Harken
What does that mean
We were there
We saw you kill him
( ) So what is this
shakedown
You think you can blackmail me because you saw me kill my wife's lover
Nick winces
So close
( ) Say his name
Nick and Harken turn to Dale
What
() 103
123 : 123 The guy you killed
What was his name
Trust me, Pellit's name doesn't matter anymore
There it is
(turning to Dale) Let's go, guys -- He freezes as he sees for the first time that Kurt didn't accompany them into the study
It's just him and Dale
Nick looks around, panicked
Yeah,  killed Pellit -- Hang on
Hold that thought, because  want to get my friend, -- walked right up to his door and shot him in his fucking chest, and 'll tell you something: liked it
So if you think 'm a pussy who won't do the same exact thing to some half-assed blackmailer, guess again
(looking back at the ) You know who really thinks you're a pussy is my friend Kurt
Let me go grab him and you can tell him exactly what you just -- You're pathetic, Waters
You come into my home, on my goddam birthday and try and pull this shit
Well, guess what
You're a dead man
You
( ) you, and your friend Kurt, whoever the fuck he is
Dead
Men
() 104
123 : (2) 123 () We didn't know it was your birthday
Harken has crossed to a drawer and taken out a small safe
He begins turning the combination lock
What are you doing
What's in that
My gun
Just give me a second
Nick and Dale exchange a look, then quickly rush out of the room
124
'   -   124 looking thoroughly freaked out, Nick and Dale push their way through the partygoers
We had him
We had the whole thing
What happened to Kurt
Just then, the door to a guest bathroom opens and Kurt emerges, buckling his belt and looking strangely red in the face
Oh, hey
`Hey'
Where were you
Uh,  had to go to the bathroom
Bad salmon puff
Are we ready to record Harken
You're too late, Kurt
He confessed the whole damn thing
More than once
Then he told us we were dead men
He's getting his gun right now
Oh, man, 'm so sorry
fucked up
() 105
124 : 124 Yeah, you -- Suddenly, the bathroom door opens again and out steps Mrs
Harken, also looking disheveled
She adjusts her dress then rejoins the party
(realizing what Kurt ) You dick
Overcome with rage, Nick  Kurt in the arm then rushes to the door
Dale and Kurt hurry after him
125    125 seeing them go
With a grim look, he calmly heads to the garage
126
'  -   126 Nick sits steaming mad as Kurt drives
Dan fiddles with the tape recorder in the back
Look,  wasn't thinking
She's so hot and 'm so weak
'm a weak, weak man
admit it
From the back seat, we hear from the tape recorder: (
) In here
But all those people are right outside
(
) know
That makes it even hotter
We hear unbuckling and unzipping
(
) Your balls are so smooth
(
) wax them
Is there anything you don't wax
Kurt shrugs
We hear some ,
() 106
126 : 126 Ugh
Turn it off, Dale
(
) Oh yeah
oh shit
(
) Whoops
That was fast
() Yeah, Dale, turn that off
127
-   127 short distance behind a car is following Kurt's
As it comes closer we see it's a Porsche
And it's driven by a determined-looking Harken
128
'  -    128 Kurt's car turns the corner and stops short
129
'  -   129 From the guys'  we see an unmarked car and a police squad car parked outside of Kurt's place
Hagan and Samson stand with two
(
) Holy shit
They must have found my
(
) Turn around
Get us out of here
130
-   130 Kurt quickly does a -turn and  off in the direction they came, inadvertently  through a red light
We see a traffic camera
131  -      131 clearly showing the three guys, their faces distorted with panic
107
132
'  -   132 Okay, it's clear that none of us can go home again
Probably ever
What
'm sure they have cops at all our places
think our best bet is to get out of the country
Where are we going to go
Mexico
Everyone flees to Mexico
That's the first place they'll look
You're right
What about Asia
We could become kick boxers
What the fuck are you talking about
What if our entire lives have been leading up to this moment
What if we were destined from the very beginning to become Asian kick boxers
What if  was destined to smack you right in the face
That seems like a lesser destiny
: Dale's cell phone rings
( ) Hello
: 108
133
'  -   133 Julia lies in a bubble bath, a glass of wine on the edge of the tub
Hello, lover
Oh God
Look, Julia,  can't talk right now -- Kurt reacts at hearing it's Julia
He makes an "'m not here" gesture
No worries, baby
actually meant to call your home phone
You know, to tell Stacy about us
No
Wait
think 've waited long enough
'm tired of you playing with my emotions
'm not playing
'm going to do it
swear
This Friday
At the office
Fine
Wait
What are you going to do to me
'm going to
have sex with you
Details
And be explicit
Right now
You want me to say it
Oh, shit
We've got company
() 109
133 : 133 He points out the back window and the guys react as they see Harken driving directly on their tail
It's Harken
Lose him
Lose him
Sure, Nick
His 500 horsepower is no match for my 150
( ) Say it
( ) 'm gonna put my penis in your pussy
Despite the danger, Kurt and Nick turn curiously to look at Dale
Oh, come on, Casanova
You can do better than that
( ) 'm gonna make you feel good
With my tongue
and my fingers
And whatnot
Just then, Harken speeds up and  into the tail of Kurt's car
Kurt struggles to stay on the road
Jesus Christ, this guy's nuts
You going to slap me with your cock, Dale
Yes
Yes
'm going to beat your face with my cock
More
Harken again  Kurt's car from behind
tail light shatters
() 110
133 : (2) 133 () 'm gonna put my balls in your hair
'm gonna spit on your arms
Kurt and Nick exchange a baffled look
See you Friday, you dirty bird
Julia hangs up
Dale looks like he's been violated
Nice job `fucking the crazy out of her,' Kurt
Maybe  should've spit on her arms
(
) Good evening, Mr
Gamble
The three of them , startled by the sudden voice in the car with them
What the hell
(
) This is Gregory, your On Star rep
Our on-board sensors report that you have a damaged tail light
Yeah, thanks, Gregory, we know
We're being chased by a crazy man and he just smashed into us
Kurt looks in the rearview mirror and sees Harken is still behind them
As his car reaches an intersection, Kurt swerves at the last second and takes a hard left
Harken overshoots the turn
(
) Oh dear
will alert the local police authorities and direct them to your location
No, wait
Don't call the police
They're already after us
() 111
133 : (3) 133 They think we murdered someone
Suddenly, Kurt's engine dies and the car comes to a gradual stop
Why are you slowing down
'm not
The engine died
(
) have remotely disabled your engine
Why would you do that, Gregory
(
) It's a standard On Star safety protocol when we believe a driver has committed a crime
pay nineteen bucks a month for this fucking service
(
) Please stay with your vehicle
The police should arrive shortly
thought you were our friend, Gregory
There's a sound of screeching tires and Harken's Porsche up behind them
He's not stopping
Oh, shit
134
-   134 Harken's car  into the rear of Kurt's, forcing it into the back of a parked car
Even if the engine was working, there'd be nowhere to go now
Dazed from the impact, the guys look back to see Harken slowly approaching on foot, holding a gun in his hand
() 112
134 : 134 Shit, shit, shit
Harken taps on Kurt's window with the barrel of the gun
Kurt lowers the window
'm guessing you don't want to information --
Out of the car
All of you
The three guys nervously exit the car and face Harken who points the gun at them
Look, Mr
Harken -- Shut the fuck up
've got six bullets in here
So if  want to, can shoot each of you twice, just like  did that bastard, Pellit
But if  do that, 'll have to spend the rest of my life running from the law or rotting in jail
Police sirens approaching
( ) So, you're not gonna shoot us
No
have a better idea
Harken turns the gun toward his own thigh and
Unnnnhhhh
What the --
As his leg bleeds, Harken wipes the gun off with his shirt, then suddenly tosses it to Dale
Catch
Startled, Dale catches the pistol with shaking hands
() 113
134 : (2) 134 ( ) Now  can tell the cops that when discovered you three killed Pellit, you tried to kill me to shut me up
That's crazy
Down the street, two squad cars turn the corner and speed toward them
Dale looks down at the gun in his hand and drops it
Is it
Because  don't see a shred of evidence proving that killed Pellit
It's like 've always told you, Nick
Life is a marathon and you can't win a marathon without putting a few Band-Aids on your nipples
Nick deflates
The three guys realize Harken's won
Then, from the car's open window they hear: (
) Did  mention that this conversation is being recorded
Kurt, Nick and Dale exchange a look of shock and relief
Who said that
() That's Gregory, our On Star rep
(
) () My name is Atmanand
Harken's face falls
He looks around nervously as the police cars come to a halt
You can't -- this isn't -- And with that, Harken   as fast as his injured leg will take him
It's not very fast
The guys watch him for a beat as they share a joyful, exhausted moment together
() 114
134 : (3) 134 think this is gonna work out okay for us
told you
(: ) Should we stop him
Probably
've got this
(looking to heaven) This is for you, Gam Gam
Nick sprints off after his hobbling boss and in , violently  Harken to the pavement
Harken goes down hard, his face  against the asphalt
As the  hurry toward them, Nick kneels on the back of Harken's neck, pinning him
Get the fuck off me
Kurt steps up and kneels beside the battered figure
() Hey, Harken, one last thing
() What
Your wife gives great head
Harken struggles wildly but he's helpless
: 135
-  135 : () 115
135 : 135 The sun is shining
Birds are chirping
It's a bright, new day as Kurt heads into the building
136
-  136 Kurt enters and looks over at what was Pellit's office
He smiles when he sees Margie, the pregnant employee, now running the company
He heads over
137
'  -   137 Kurt knocks on the doorframe and enters
Oh, hey, Kurt
Come in
Thanks, Margie
just wanted to congratulate you on taking over Bobby's job
Thank you
Terrible what happened to him
Yeah
Tough month for the Pellit family
Anyway, if there's anything  can do to help out before the baby gets here, please let me know
() What baby
Your baby
(beat, offended) 'm not pregnant
() Yeah, right
Look at that big belly
Kurt pats her belly
Margie now looks genuinely pissed off
() 116
137 : 137 'm aware that  have a weight problem, Kurt
It just happens to manifest itself in my lower abdomen
oh, my God
'm really sorry, Margie -- He falls silent under Margie's death stare
() Kurt,  know you were a favorite of Jack's
He was willing to overlook your inappropriate behavior with female clients and service people
But you should be aware, 'm not Jack
And  have very little tolerance for the mistreatment of women
So consider this your first strike
How was  supposed to know you were just fat -- Strike two
Kurt opens his mouth to say something but thinks better of it
He stands up and slumps out
Life as he knew it at Pellit Chemicals is clearly over
138
-  138 Julia enters to find Dale waiting for her lies asleep in the chair, his face obscured by the nitrous mask
Thank God it's Friday, right, Dale
() Yeah
Let's drill this patient and then you can drill me
() 117
138 : 138 Could we do it on top of the patient
like the element of danger
() You continue to surprise me, you weird little man
Julia quickly undoes the patient's belt and yanks his pants down
( ) You like that
This getting you hot
Oh, yeah
Julia begins handling the patient's implied genitals which are obscured by a tray of tools
(in a puppet voice) ` wish  was Dale's weenie so could have sex with Julia
' Suddenly, the patient bursts out  and sits up
What the hell
The patient pulls off his nitrous mask to reveal it's , the guys' former classmate from the bar
() Sorry, Dale
couldn't keep it together anymore -- What is this
Julia, meet my old high school friend, Kenny
How do you do
() 118
138 : (2) 138 Kenny will do just about anything for fifty bucks and that's why hired him to help me frame you
Your days of sexually assaulting me and your patients are over
( ) Seriously
This is all you've got
Your word against mine
'm a highly respected professional and you're two losers
Three losers
Dale points to the window where Julia sees outside holding up a video camera
He waves to her
You little bastard -- Shut up, Julia
Now, my fiancee and  are going to take a very expensive two week vacation which you're going to pay for
And then 'm going to come back to a rape- free workplace
Because if you so much as look at my ass, 'll have yours locked up
With a bounce in his step, Dale strides out of the room
There's an awkward beat with Kenny and Julia
don't suppose you could take a look at this molar -- () Kenny scampers out, pulling up his pants as he goes
139
'  ( ') -  139 Nick is in his new office as a young employee, , 20's, pops his head in
You wanted to see me, Mr
Waters
() 119
139 : 139 Hi, Carter
Just wanted to check if you had a chance to finish those regional sales projections yet
Oh,  think  may need another day
Okay
was hoping to give them to the marketing guys today, but can hold them off
() In the future, it'd be great if you could tell me if you're going to miss a deadline
Carter's eyes narrow
All at once, he rushes at Nick, grabs him by the throat and  him , shattering it
140
-   140 Nick plummets forty feet and lands with a directly onto his own car
Just behind him we see a parking plaque that reads "Nick Waters, Senior  of Sales
" : 141   () 141 Carter stands opposite Nick as before
Sure
No problem, Mr
Waters
Thanks, buddy
Nick smiles and closes the door behind Carter
He settles into his comfy chair and puts his feet up on the desk
It's good to be the boss
