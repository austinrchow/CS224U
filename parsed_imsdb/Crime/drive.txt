It's only as we pull out that we realize it's the engine of a car
Over the image we hear a voice talking on a phone

4 The Clippers-Knicks game plays on the car radio now
Driver is only half listening, focused on the road
We see his face in the passing neon lights
Feline good looks
Impassive blue eyes
Something almost melancholy in his unwavering gaze
He drives carefully, letting other cars overtake

It's not all that different from his last one
Clean, sparse, and anonymous
He doesn't even bother to walk in

He drives past a row of brightly lit Mexican food shacks on Silver Lake Boulevard and turns into a run down garage lit up with a neon sign - Shannon's Picture Car Warehouse - vintage cars

' /   -
9 , the owner of the garage, has a distinctive limp
Driver follows him past rows of vintage cars
Plain Jane cheap like you asked for but with a hundred and sixty horsepower inside
You get any sleep
Not this week
As Shannon grins we feel the familiarity between them
can offer you some Halcyon
Won't work
They head past more cars -- Fords, Dodges, Buicks -- until they arrive at a plain looking Impala
There she is
Silver Impala
Most popular car in the state of California
Driver casts his eyes over the unimpressive vehicle then holds out his hand for the keys

10 The basketball game is approaching the end of the third quarter
Driver's behind the wheel of the Impala now, cruising past rows of dingy toy stores on 3rd Street
He glances at his watch
It's 9:50
He checks his mirror then turns into a side street
11 /
/  /  -
11 vast electronics superstore dominates the deserted street
Under the pale yellow glow of the street lamps, Driver sees signs advertising a `huge blow out weekend sale'
He pulls over, making sure he has a good view of the entrance
On the radio, the basketball commentator is getting more excited
This is some comeback from the Clippers
Only a few minutes ago they looked dead and buried
Driver reaches under the seat and pulls out a small handheld scanner
He switches it on, tuning it to the right frequency
Crackling police dispatches are interspersed with the basketball commentary now
9 Adam 81, what is your current location
Repeat, what is your current location
Another unbelievable three pointer from Davis and the Clippers are within five
Out of the corner of his eye Driver sees two  approach
He doesn't react, expecting them
They cut through the fence with bolt cutters and approach the main building
Driver watches them pull on their masks, then one of them takes out a shotgun and blasts the lock to the front door
Instantly the alarm shrills
The only thing Driver does is to turn on his stop watch
Time out Knicks
The stop watching keeps ticking away, the siren blaring, the commentary continuing, the police scanner crackling
The storefront is hidden in shadow, impossible to tell what's going on inside
Driver looks at his stop watch
Almost three minutes
One of the masked men emerges now, carrying a duffel bag
He hurries over and gets in the back of Driver's car without a word
There's no sign of the other robber
() 9/24/10 11 : 11 The commentary continues, so does the crackling on the police scanner
Four minutes
Still no sign of the second armed robber
His companion in the back starts to look nervous, wondering what's happened to his partner
Driver doesn't betray a hint of nerves
Four and half minutes on his stop watch
Thirty seconds more and he's on his way
Suddenly the second robber appears from the shadows, running as fast as he can to the getaway car
He jumps into the back seat a few seconds short of five minutes and Driver screeches off

12 Driver thunders over the 1st Street bridge towards Boyle Heights, then eases his foot off the gas, slowing to a steady speed
In the back seat the two armed robbers rip off their masks, looking pumped up with adrenalin
Driver studies them in his rear view mirror, then swerves right on Mission Street as his police scanner crackles to life
Attention all units

Superstore on Traction Avenue
Suspects headed Eastbound on 1st Street

Driver swings sharply into 4th Street now, crossing the
River again, heading back in the same direction he came
Airships dispatched
Downtown and Boyle Heights
All units standby
Repeat, all units standby
Up ahead, the lights of Downtown
glitter against the night sky
Hovering between the neon green glow of the skyscrapers Driver sees the red and white glint of a police helicopter
He switches off his headlights, turning left on Santa Fe Avenue

13 The armed robbers watch in tense silence as Driver weaves in and out of the industrial alleyways with his lights switched off
It's as if he's trying to find his way out of the maze or probing to see if there's anyone out there
1 Baker 11, headed south on Boyle Avenue
No sign of suspects
Repeat, no sign of suspects
The armed robbers look relieved when suddenly a police car glides past at the end of the alleyway, its lights also off
() 9/24/10 13 : 13 It's like catching a glimpse of a passing shark's fin
Driver taps the brakes gently, his car sliding to a stop
He stays there a moment, then eases the Impala forward, turning in the same direction as the black-and-white
14 /
/    /  -
14 It's a high-risk strategy but Driver follows the black-and-white at a distance, hidden in the darkness, knowing other squad cars won't be checking the same route
The police car makes its way through the dimly lit industrial zone, unaware it's being shadowed
Driver turns his car radio up a whisper
And for the first time in the game the Clippers have the lead
71 to 69
Seven to go in the Fourth here at the Staples Centre
Driver turns the sound back down
Up ahead, the police car swings left, disappearing from view
Driver slows down too, anticipating the next obstacle
He doesn't have long to wait
In the distance he suddenly sees the piercing beam of a police chopper's search-lights, sweeping the area one more time
Driver floors the gas, speeding straight towards the approaching helicopter
The armed robbers are too stunned to protest
They just sit there, watching the sweeping searchlights getting closer and closer
Then suddenly it becomes clear what Driver's doing
Up ahead, there's a small underpass below the 7th Street bridge
Driver slides the car under the safety of the bridge just before the chopper's searchlights spot them
15 /

15 The roar of the helicopter thunders overhead
The underpass is crammed with dirty mattresses and shopping carts
Sleeping can be seen under dirty blankets
Driver waits for the echo of the helicopter to fade, then moves forward again

16 Gloomy yellow street-lamps shine down on the industrial zone
Rows of delivery trucks are parked outside the meat-packing factories
Driver cruises cautiously down the deserted street
The crackling of the police scanner and the droning of the basketball commentary add to the tension
Finally up ahead he sees car-lights streaming back and forth on Broadway
Get down
() 9/24/10 16 : 16 The armed robbers lie flat on the back seat, paying Driver more respect now
17 /

17 There's a steady flow of traffic on Broadway
Driver falls in behind the other cars
On the radio, the basketball game is still playing
Three thirteen left on the clock
Dunleavy calls a time out and it's the Clippers by one
The passing head-lamps light up Driver's face
There's not a trace of emotion in his eyes -- even when he spots a patrol car approaching in the opposite direction
Buckle up your seat belts Clippers fans
This game really is too close to call
The two cars pass each other slowly
Driver sees the cops in the Black-and-White peering at the Impala as they head past
He turns down the basketball game and focuses on the scanner
This is 1 David 16
Silver Impala headed South on Broadway and Pico
Couldn't get a look at her license plates
Appears to be only one occupant
In the back seat, the armed robbers wait nervously for the police dispatch to respond
1 David 16

As soon as he hears this Driver swerves sharply into the next street

19 Driver bursts out onto Pico now
squad car headed in the opposite direction slows down as it sees him but is caught up in the flow of traffic, unable to turn round and give chase
1 David 11
suspect headed West on Pico
Driver threads his way through the vehicles in front of him, so smooth and effortless it's hard to tell how fast he's going
He glances up as he hears the dull rumble of a police chopper overhead
The helicopter is almost directly above him, swinging its search-beam back and forth to get a lock on his position
Driver pushes the car as fast as it will go, but there's no way of outrunning the chopper
Blue light floods the asphalt around him as he guns down Figueroa

21 The Impala screeches from one level to the next
With a game going on, the parking lot is almost full
Finally Driver pulls into a free parking space
Thirty seconds remaining and all the Knicks have to do is run out the clock
Driver glances in his side mirror
Behind him, dozens of are already streaming out into the parking lot before the game is over, hoping to avoid the inevitable traffic
() 9/24/10 21 : 21 Gordon back to Davis
Davis for three
This is unbelievable
The jubilant commentary continues, but Driver isn't listening anymore
The game has served its purpose
More fans flood into the parking lot
Dozens of cars pull out of their places
What a remarkable comeback
Outplayed for most of the game, the Clippers have shown incredible resilience
Driver glances at the armed robbers and nods
It's time
They climb out of the car, merging in with the crowd
Driver watches them disappear, then slips on a Clippers cap, climbs out of the Impala himself and heads towards another car
22

22 Outside the parking lot, the police are waiting, stopping anything that looks like an Impala, shining their flashlights into the windows
Wearing his Clippers cap and a Clippers sticker on his new car, Driver calmly drives past them, making his getaway

It's only as we pull out further that we see several other ` ' sitting in the same fold up chairs, reading car magazines and scripts as they're powdered by - , and realize we're on a movie set
Driver glances up from his script and sees another being fitted with an  mask
The stuntman now looks identical to the  of the movie who stands nearby

Shannon joins the rest of the crew, looking on

He swerves between several oil drums then straightens up on the main road
In his rear view mirror he sees a black Dodge Charger appear on cue, bearing down on him
() 10 9/24/10 26 : 26 Driver slows to forty, like he's supposed to, but the black Charger keeps coming at speed
Driver's eyes stay fixed on his rear view mirror, judging the other car's speed and angle of approach to perfection
The Charger slams into the back of Driver's car at sixty miles an hour, hitting him just above the left rear wheel
Driver's reactions are quick as lightning, counter-steering as his Black-and-White goes careening off the road
He keeps the car upright long enough to slow it down before it finally flips end over end
Up ahead, the Charger skids to a showy stop
2ND   / And
Some clapping and cheering breaks out, but most the crew couldn't care less, returning to their cell-phones and shot lists
Only Shannon seems interested in Driver, limping over and helping him out of his battered Black-and-White

takes a delivery of Chinese food at the door and carries it over to a table where Shannon is sitting with an old friend,
Here you go, Mr
Rose
(Taking out the white boxes) Egg rolls, chicken chow mein, five flavor shrimp and Peking duck
Did they remember the chop sticks
Doesn't look like it, sir
Let me run and get the guy
From the way the waiter hurries off we get a sense of Bernie's power and authority
He turns back to Shannon, resuming their conversation
() 11 9/24/10 27 : 27 You run a perfectly good business
Why would you want to change now
You know how much my business made last year
Thirty Grand
Takes me six months to build a car and a couple of seconds for these jerks to write it off on a stunt that doesn't even make it into the movie
Bernie shakes his head but clearly has a soft spot for Shannon
How much do you need
Let me talk you through it first
That sounds like a lot
Doesn't have to be
The big money teams burn through three, four million a year but that's `cause they're using half a dozen test drivers and a stable of cars
don't know anything about car racing but assume there's a reason for that
Sure, but it's not the only way
All  need is a hard-used stock car
We start off with the small-town action then work our way up
There's close to two thousand events out there and once we make the Show we're talking millions
`Millions'
There's a fortune to be made
Sponsorship
deals
We'll even name the team after you
Bernie looks at his friend in mild exasperation then turns away as the waiter returns with a handful of chop sticks
Thank you, Ron
You sure you don't want any of this
() 12 9/24/10 27 : (2) 27 No, thanks
Bernie waits for the waiter to leave then continues
You still haven't given me a number
Shannon hesitates but only for a second
Four hundred and thirty thousand dollars
Bernie Rose can't help grinning at his nerve
Look,  wouldn't come to you unless  was sure about this
Come on, Shannon
How can you be sure
What have you got these big money teams don't have
got a driver
And they got half a dozen Drivers you told me
Not like this one
He stares at his friend with quiet conviction
been working with this guy a long time - 've never seen anything like it
had the money 'd back him myself
Bernie Rose considers him quietly
But you don't have the money
Everything  own is in metal
had to sell my Bullit car the other day just to pay the gas bill
'm telling you, Bernie, put this kid behind a wheel there's nothing he can't do
() 13 9/24/10 27 : (3) 27 And what happens to my money if this kid gets hit by a bus
Shannon's about to reply when they're interrupted by a big bull of a man with a gruff voice
What are you doing eating Chink food in my restaurant
What's a Jew doing running a Pizzeria
Worst fucking pizza in  by the way
How hard is it to bake a loaf of bread
It's the fucking water in this city
Shannon smiles, intimidated by Nino, giving up his seat respectfully
Nino doesn't even acknowledge him
thought you were supposed to be out of town anyway
Well, 'm back
(Barely a glance at Shannon) Take a hike
need to talk to my partner
Be polite, Nino
invited him here
Oh, 'm sorry
How you doing, Shannon
How's the fucking leg
Bernie senses things are only going to get worse and dismisses Shannon gently
'll think about it but  want to meet your guy first

In the distance we see a trail of dust moving across the flatland
Everything is silent, then slowly the hum of an engine rises as the stock car turns towards us
It shimmers in the heat waves, the noise of its engine getting louder as it picks up speed
Shannon stands with his friend Bernie Rose at the edge of the makeshift track, staring at the glittering car with its colorful signage advertising everything from Snickers to Cheerios
Looks like a chocolate bar

Looks a little long in the tooth to me

Driver shrugs
Shannon grins, turning to Bernie now
Bernie, this is the driver  been telling you about
One look at Bernie Rose and Driver senses the power and authority behind his deceptively gentle eyes
Bernie's thinking of investing in our race team
The old mobster holds out his hand, meeting Driver's gaze
My hands are a little dirty
Don't worry
So are mine
() 16 9/24/10 33 : 33 He gives Driver a big grin and a warm handshake, sizing him up
Driver smiles politely, gazing back at him
The stock car's owner interrupts the moment between them, holding a stopwatch
Couldn't see much wrong with that
You beat the fastest lap by more than half a second
You might wanna take a look at the suspension before we go again
(Turning back to Bernie) Nice to meet you
Bernie's still studying him
You too
Their eyes stay on each other, then Driver follows the stock car owner and his mechanics back to the car
Bernie Rose stares after him quietly, thinking to himself
Shannon can feel he's getting interested
You gonna give me the four

Driver walks past the vast selection of instant coffee brands, bemused by the choice
Suddenly he notices something out of the corner of his eye
At the far end of the aisle his pretty neighbor, Irene, is browsing through the confectionery section
Standing next to her is a young boy of six or seven, ()
He grabs a multi-pack of snickers and puts it in Irene's shopping basket
Irene calmly picks it out, replaces it on the shelf, and takes a single snicker bar for him instead

Benicio peers in too, trying to be helpful

Driver smiles back awkwardly, not sure how else to respond
Irene switches on the  for Benicio, sitting him down on the couch
Driver has a sip of water, glancing around the room
He notices a few photographs on a side table
Most of them are of Benicio and Irene, but one of them shows the little boy standing next to a strikingly handsome Latino man
Irene turns around and sees him looking at the picture
That's Benicio's father

Don't worry, ma'am, your son'll be fine
didn't mean it like that
Shannon smiles to himself, sensing her interest in Driver
We been together about five years now
He showed up out of the blue one day, no references or nothin', asking me for a job
offered him half the wages  normally pay and he didn't even blink
Been exploiting him ever since

Their eyes stay on each other, the attraction palpable
Driver finally breaks the tension, making a tentative move towards the door

What's happening now
He's telling him if he doesn't leave the earth alone he'll fight him
Irene calls out from her bedroom

She looks at Driver, watching him quietly, then looks away again
You okay
Irene takes a long time to answer, still staring out of the window
That was my husband's lawyer on the phone
He's getting an early release
She tries to sound casual
Driver takes the news quietly, even though it hits him like a sledgehammer
That's great
'm happy for Benicio
Driver knows she's trying to explain herself but doesn't say anything, driving in silence
Up ahead the traffic lights turn red and the car slows to a stop
Inside, the silence is unbearable
Irene pauses, then looks at Driver
He's even more handsome in the shadowy half-light, something achingly lonely and melancholy about his stillness
She hesitates, then moves her hand towards his, brushing the back of his hand, then slipping her fingers between his
The gesture is tiny but charged with emotion
They both stare out in silence, fingers clasped, then Irene gently withdraws her hand, as if nothing's happened

Holding Benicio in his arms he makes a thank you speech to his guests
'm touched and grateful that you're all here today -- even though  know it's probably for the food not me
His self-deprecating humor gets a chorus of laughter and agreement from the guests
Irene is standing next to her friend Cindy, looking a little uncomfortable
Anyhow, now that 've completed my in catering from Chino Business School
( ) Irene, Benicio and  are finally going to get our lives back together

' Can you hear me now, you cunt
Standard pauses, looking concerned
Sure

Across the crowded room, Irene is looking for Standard
She sees him in the bedroom, switching off his phone, and heads over

'm sorry about the noise

Another awkward silence, so much she wants to say but can't
Listen, if you're hungry we got plenty of - Suddenly she turns around as she hears her apartment door open
Standard stands there with Benicio, holding a bag of trash
He pauses, then smiles
thought if we emptied the trash everyone would get the message and go home
He grins at his wife, then looks over at Driver, his smile hiding whatever he feels inside
You're the new neighbor, right
Benicio's told me all about you
Driver seems unsure how to respond
He's a great kid
can't take any of the credit
He's got a great mother
Standard rests his hand gently on Benicio's head, still staring at Driver
He tells me you drive for the movies
Yeah
Must be pretty good
get by
Not like a nine to five gig, huh

Irene looks uncomfortable
You want me to take that
No, we got it
His eyes are still fixed on Driver
You want to come in, join us for a drink
've got some things to do
At this hour of night
Standard, he's busy
Standard doesn't respond, still holding Driver's gaze
Well, if we're still going by the time you're back you know where we are
It's good to meet you
He slips his arm around his son now and continues down the corridor, brushing past Driver on his way to empty the trash
Driver looks at Irene, then heads off in the same direction as Standard and Benicio to take the elevator

66 noise of hammering and drills
The corporate signage has been scraped off the race car and the seats ripped out
Bernie Rose has bought his partner Nino to the garage to take a look at his investment
We paid three hundred fucking grand for this
paid for it
Out of my own pocket
Anyway, that's just the shell
You start with the shell, then you build the frame, then the motor
(Pointing to an engine nearby) paid three hundred for that
The money goes on the inside not the outside
Fuck that
If 'm gonna blow three hundred wanna make sure everyone can see it
Go waste your money on something else
Shannon smiles nervously, worried Nino's going to sabotage his deal with Bernie
(Pointing to a Thunderbird) How about that fucking pussy mobile over there
You buy it
Shannon sell him the car
At the far end of the garage Driver hears them laughing, too busy working on his car to pay any attention
Shannon opens the door of the Thunderbird and invites Nino to take a seat
Try her out
She's more comfortable than a water bed
() 34 9/24/10 66 : 66 already got a fucking water bed
He sits heavily in the car and starts prodding and pressing all the control buttons as if he wants to break them
What does this fucking thing do
Windshield wipers
How about this little clit
don't know whether to fuck it or drive it
Fuck it, 'll drive it
Bernie Rose shakes his head at his partner's foul language then looks away, observing Driver quietly
Driver applies a blow torch to his car, so absorbed in his work he doesn't hear Bernie Rose approach
/ How you doing
Driver hears him and turns off the blow torch, standing up respectfully
Bernie Rose gives him a friendly smile
So, when's our first race
Soon
You gonna be ready
There's something gently challenging in his gaze
hope so
Cautious man
Like myself
Don't wanna make promises you can't keep
Driver smiles but doesn't respond
Bernie Rose finds him as hard to talk to as everyone else
Across the garage, Nino sits in the -Bird with Shannon, still fucking with him
Bernie watches them
He ever tell you how we met
() 35 9/24/10 66 : (2) 66 Driver shakes his head
did some producing back in the 80's
Interesting pictures
Kind of European
Shannon arranged the cars for us and did all the stunts
knew he was overcharging me but  loved having him around
His next business venture he tried the same thing with some of Nino's friends they broke his spine
He never had much luck
He's about to continue when they're interrupted by a familiar voice
/ Hey
Driver turns around and sees Irene's husband, Standard, heading towards him with a confident smile
You got a minute
want to - We're talking
Bernie Rose barely raises his voice but it's full of quiet menace and authority
Standard pauses, stung, but instinctively senses this is someone you don't mess with
'll wait outside
Bernie Rose watches him leave with a look of contempt, then turns back to Driver with a smile, resuming their conversation
The reason 'm telling you this is because he's got a lot invested in you
So do
Their eyes stay on each other with just a hint of tension
Anything you need just let me know

Bernie Rose studies him a moment, then finally walks away

How much do  owe you
Don't worry about it
do worry
like to pay my debts
Driver senses the quiet pride in his voice, and lets it go
Call it fifty
Standard counts out some bills from his tattered wallet, his eyes lowered
was thinking of trading her in for a new car
Something fast and cheap
You can't have both
Alright then, fast
Even though he smiles Driver senses just a hint of tension on his handsome face
(Pointing to a car) Something like that Buick over there'll cost you nine grand but there isn't much point in a city where you can't drive faster than sixty five
Standard considers the car a moment, something clearly bothering him, then looks back at Driver
You must think 'm an asshole
Driver isn't sure what he's getting at
wouldn't know
Well,  am
Six months inside for holding somebody else's stolen shit
He smiles ironically, his gaze still fixed on Driver
() 37 9/24/10 67 : (2) 67 appreciate what you did for my family when  was away but  don't plan to fuck up a second time
It's a thinly veiled message that he's back and here to stay
Driver stares back at him when Shannon emerges from the garage with Bernie Rose and Nino, calling out
Hey, kid
Come say goodbye, the money people are leaving
Driver and Standard stare at each other a moment longer then Driver breaks off
Excuse me
See you around
Driver walks off, leaving Standard alone with his thoughts
Shannon watches Standard curiously as Driver approaches
Who was that
Irene's husband
() What did  tell you about married women
Nino can't resist another dig at Shannon
What the fuck do you know about married women
Can you for once say something without the word fuck in it
As they continue their banter, Driver glances at Standard
He's walking back to his car, dialling someone on his cell phone

We haven't seen you around in a while
You must have been pretty busy
You look pretty busy yourself
She smiles, glancing at the tables she's supposed to serve
What can  get you
already ate
just wanted to see how you were
His concern touches her and makes her uncomfortable at the same time
We're okay
Standard thinks he may have found a job so  can give up my night shift
Driver stares back at her with his intense gaze
Benicio misses you
From the way she says it she could almost be talking about herself
He keeps asking me to invite you for dinner

Driver cruises past the mysterious group and winds his way further down the car park

figure lies sprawled against one of the pillars
smaller figure kneels a few feet away
Driver stops his car now, climbing out to see what's happened
The prone figure groans in pain
As Driver approaches he realizes it's Standard
His face is covered in blood and he clutches his ribs
The smaller figure is Benicio
He stares at his father helplessly, then looks up at Driver in tears
Driver kneels beside Standard, checking nothing's broken
Can you move
Where's Benicio
He's right here
Driver glances at Benicio
He looks terrified
Standard raises his head painfully and looks at his son
() 40 9/24/10 72 : 72 It's okay, Benicio
'm okay
Driver watches the boy struggling to hold back his tears
() Don't say anything to your mother, you understand

Thanks
Sorry about getting all this blood everywhere
He's still shaken but tries to pass it off with a smile
Fucking punks took me by surprise
Driver watches him, unconvinced
Fucking punks didn't look like they needed to
Standard looks at him in surprise now
You saw them, huh
Driver doesn't answer, waiting for him to continue
Standard hesitates, still not sure whether to trust him
You ever been inside

Driver begins to see how worried he is
How much
They want twenty thousand

Is that why you need a car
Standard stares back at him
What did you say you were inside for
didn't

It's a pawn shop in the valley

Driver stares at him in surprise now, more concerned than he shows
Why don't you take them away
Where would  go
Irene finds out  fucked up again 'll lose everything

Where are you going

You tell me where we start, where we're headed, where we'll be going afterwards don't take part,  don't carry weapons, drive
Standard seems surprised by Driver's professional patter

Okay, here's the deal
This much for Blanche, this much for that asshole minus what he owes me, and this much for you
He holds up the palm of his hand to Driver, the words Fuck Off written in marker pen
You still interested

Hope you didn't inherit your Papa's brains
He ruffles his son's hair then pours himself another shot of tequila
Irene notices he's drinking, turning to Driver
Would you like some more chicken
Thanks
Their eyes stay on each as she serves him
Standard sees the look between them but his only reaction is to drain his glass and tuck into his food
Now this is what  call a deluxe chicken
Irene and  are gonna open a restaurant together once  raise the money
That's why she's working in that Mexican joint
Figure out how it's done
She's got more ambition than anyone  know, more smarts too

Fine
Irene looks at Standard as he pours himself another drink
Don't you think that's enough
Come on, we're celebrating

Are you working on anything else
Stop asking the poor guy all these - ( ) Then why don't you go ahead and talk for all of us
All right,  will
This time next week 'm gonna take you and Benicio away with me
Irene stops and looks at him in surprise
Where you wanna go, Benicio

He pulls over by the curb when suddenly he notices something
Parked a hundred yards down the road he sees another vehicle glinting in the sunlight
To the ordinary eye it's no different from the other cars parked nearby, but to Driver it stands out
For one, it's a Chrysler
Secondly, it has reinforced bumpers and racing tires
Driver's stopwatch shows four minutes now
He looks away from the Chrysler, gazing at the doors of the pawn shop, expecting Standard and Blanche to burst out at any moment
But there's no sign of them
The seconds tick away
Five minutes
Driver hesitates, all his instincts telling him to drive off, but he stays where he is, thinking of Irene
Suddenly he sees Standard and Blanche emerge from the pawn shop, Standard clutching a big black gym bag in his hand
() 49 9/24/10 81 : (2) 81 He smiles at Driver as he approaches when suddenly he hears the crack of gunshots behind him
Driver sees the look of panic on his face as he spins around
strides out of the pawn shop
Crouching low in an expert firing position he squeezes off several shots
The force of the bullets sends Standard flying
Driver sees him hit the sidewalk, arterial blood pumping from his neck
Blanche screams, grabbing the gym bag and leaping into the back seat of the car
Driver hesitates, takes one last look at Standard's lifeless body, then hits the gas as more gunshots crack behind him
As Driver's car roars down the street, the Chrysler suddenly comes to life, pulling out of its parking place

82 Driver glances in his rear-view mirror and sees the Chrysler on his tail
It doesn't seem to be trying to close the gap, just following at a discreet distance
In the back seat, Blanche zips open the gym bag, then stares in shock
Christ, there wasn't supposed to be this much money
There are literally stacks of hundred dollar bills crammed inside the gym bag
Driver catches her reaction in the mirror, but his attention is focussed on the Chrysler
Up ahead, at an intersection, the lights turn red
Driver thinks about running them, but decides against it, braking sharply
The Chrysler draws up beside him, its windows glinting in the sunlight
Move for Chrissakes
Driver ignores her, still watching the Chrysler out of the corner of his eye
The lights change to green but Driver doesn't move
Nor does the Chrysler
Behind them, other cars start honking their horns
Suddenly Driver roars off, swerving left at speed
The Chrysler reacts, screeching off in pursuit
Driver floors the gas
On speed and power his vehicle may be no match for the Chrysler, but in traffic the odds are even
He weaves his way past the slower cars, putting obstacles between himself and the Chrysler
The pursuing car matches him move for move, staying on his tail
In the back seat, Blanche looks terrified, buckling herself in
() 49A 9/24/10 82 : 82 Driver swerves left then suddenly makes a hard right onto a deserted canyon road
The mustang somehow manages to make the same turn
It gets close enough to "pit" Driver, its nose pressing against the rear corner of Driver's vehicle
Driver's almost run off the road, but manages to save it and regains control of his car
The Mustang pulls out wide to build momentum and smash into him
As it moves in to deliver the knockout blow, Driver pulls the Emergency Brake and spins 180 degrees, causing the Mustang to miss and lose control for a brief moment
Now the two cars are nose to nose, barrelling down the road, Driver heading in reverse as fast as he can, the Mustang closing fast
It rams Driver's front bumper
The two cars separated for an instant
The Mustang guns it, ready to smash into Driver again
Driver clocks an upcoming three way intersection dotted with construction equipment
In a last ditch attempt to evade his pursuer he throws a reverse 180, then incredibly keeps going, spinning 270 degrees
The Mustang tries to make the same turn, but this time the maneuver is beyond his ability
Driver's suckered him into a corner he can't control
The Mustang crashes into the construction equipment in a sickening crunch of metal on metal
Driver guns the motor and speeds away

Blanche sits on the bed, looking pale
How much did Cook tell you you could expect to net
Forty Grand
She glances at the bag, staring at how much more money there is
Driver switches on the cheap  set with the remote, flicking through the news channels
There's no mention of the robbery yet
He zips up the bag and heads out
Stay here
Don't answer the door
Blanche nods, too shaken to protest

Driver walks back into the motel room
Blanche lies on the bed, looking more relaxed
Driver picks up the remote and flicks through the channels until he finally finds a breaking news story on the robbery
There is a police mug-shot of Standard on screen
The armed robber was pronounced dead at the scene
He was identified as Standard Guzman of Echo Park, Los Angeles
Driver listens to the report in silence
Blanche seems upset again, confronted with the reality of what's happened
Other details are unclear but the owner of the pawn shop told reporters that the robber had no accomplices and that the items he'd taken had been recovered
In other news
Driver switches off the , staring at the blank screen in surprise
He turns to Blanche
The guy saw you grab the money and jump in the car -- why didn't he say anything
've no idea
Any idea there'd be another car waiting
() 52 9/24/10 86 : 86 This time she takes a fraction too long to answer
already told you everything - Driver suddenly slaps her -- hard
You just got a little kid's father killed
You think  won't hurt you
He raises his hand to slap her again and this time she talks, tears welling in her eyes
Cook told me another car would hold us up
but he never said anything about this much money or anyone getting killed
Driver stares at her quietly, beginning to put the pieces together in his head
You were gonna rip us off and split the take
She nods guiltily
How long have you known him
Just a couple months
We were fooling around
've never been mixed up in anything like this - You know his real name
He told me it was Chris, but  just called him Cook
You're going to take me to him right now, you understand
She nods, terrified, tears running down her face
Can  go wash up
Driver nods distractedly, his mind racing
Blanche heads over to the bathroom
() 53 9/24/10 86 : (2) 86 As she disappears inside Driver notices something on the bed where she's just been lying
It's her cell phone
Still flipped open as if she's called someone recently
Driver reaches for the cell phone when he notices the silhouette of a  crossing the curtains
Someone's outside
The door handle of the motel room starts to turn, slowly -- then suddenly there's the roar of a shotgun from the bathroom
Driver reacts in an instant, rushing towards the bathroom door
He has to barge it open, something obstructing his way
87

87 Driver almost trips over Blanche's sprawled body as he bursts through
One quick glance and he knows she's dead - half her head blown off
Another quick glance and he sees her killer, a big burly , trying to climb through the same bathroom window where he just shot her
Driver moves like lightning, grabbing the man's arms before he can get off another shot and pulling him through the window
The hitman lands heavily in a sea of broken glass, cutting his forehead open, blinded momentarily by the blood in his eyes
Driver takes his opportunity and slams the man's face back into the glass strewn floor, stunning him for a few more seconds as they struggle
Crawling away, he grabs the towel rack and pulls the metal bar off the wall
Using it as a spear he impales the hitman and grabs his shotgun
88

88 In the bedroom, the 2nd  finally kicks the door open
Driver bursts through the bathroom door at the same time -- firing the 1st shooter's shotgun
The force of the blast picks up the 2nd hitman and flings him against the wall like a rag doll
The startling explosion of violence is over just as suddenly as it began
Driver slumps to the floor in exhaustion, his hand and his arm ripped open by the broken glass
There's blood splatter all over the wall
Neon lights from outside flashing on the dead man's face
But no panicked footsteps or sirens yet
Driver crawls over to the dead hitman and rifles through his pockets
All he finds are a set of car keys

Well,  guess it's done now

(His hand shakes) You'd be better off with a mechanic not a medic
Driver looks up at him warily from Shannon's pull out bed
Relax
Just having my fun with you
Doc picks up his bottle of scotch from among his bowls of Peroxide and Betadine, takes a drink, then offers it to Driver
Take a hit off that
Chances are you'll need it
Driver shakes his head, closing his eyes
Shannon watches him quietly, concerned for him but also curious about the money
What did you do with the cash
It's safe
Shannon hesitates, but can't help himself
You want me to look after it for you
Driver doesn't answer, gritting his teeth as Doc pulls out the largest shard of glass
Just think what we could do with all that - Two guys just tried to kill me for it want to find out who it belongs to first
Shannon nods, coming back down to earth
This guy Cook got a real name
Maybe Chris
Probably not
'll ask Bernie if he's heard of him
() 56 9/24/10 93 : (2) 93 Driver grimaces again as Doc pulls out another shard of glass

Bernie Rose grabs the remote and turns up the volume to drown out his neighbors
They've been going at it ever since they moved in
She's such a nice lady but it's a lousy Shidach
It's a wonder they haven't killed each other
( ) So, what's your interest in the Seventh Heaven
Shannon doesn't understand, looking confused
It's a strip joint on La Cienega
Your friend Cook runs it
Why're you curious about him all of a sudden
Even though they're close, Shannon's wary of giving away too much information
friend of mine owes him some money
was wondering if you knew him
Yeah,  know him
He's a crazy Albanian
If were your friend 'd pay up

You wake me up this early this friend must be a close friend
() Yeah
How's our car by the way
We're all set for next month
And our driver
He's doing great
That's what you should worry about
Shannon smiles back but Bernie senses how distracted he is

There's a handful of  watching a pole dance, but otherwise the place is empty
Driver turns down a long corridor
couple of emerge from their changing room, surprised to see him, but he puts them at ease with a friendly smile
Cook moved office again
That one over there
Driver smiles gratefully, then heads towards an office at the end of the corridor
He knocks on the door
voice calls back
() 58 9/24/10 96 : 96 / It's open
Driver takes a hammer out of his jacket, then starts turning the door handle as if he can't get in
/ It's open, goddamit
He hears Cook striding impatiently towards the door now
He waits, then suddenly kicks the door open, right in Cook's face
Before Cook can recover, Driver storms into the office, smashing him across the shoulder with the hammer
Cook collapses in a heap
Driver's about to hit him again, when he sees that Cook's left hand is broken and there are cuts and bruises on his face
Someone's clearly given him a beating since the robbery
Should've figured you for a shill
Who were you fronting for
Fuck you - Driver smashes the hammer into Cook's right hand now, breaking it too
Cook screams
Some of the strippers have gathered at the door but Driver couldn't care less
Whose money am  holding
Don't worry
They'll come get it
You don't know who you're fucking with - Driver smashes the hammer into the metal plates supporting Cook's left hand
He screams like a stuck pig
Who's money am  holding
(Barely able to get the words out) Fuck you
The strippers look stunned and riveted at the same time
Driver bends over Cook and rifles through his pockets

And what do you get out of it
Just that
Out of it
You put a muzzle on Cook, forget your zombies at the Motel, forget we ever had this conversation
Nino's thinking to himself, looking more concerned than he sounds
Your partners happy with that

Are you going to be okay

Irene gets up to leave when the buzzer rings
She walks over and opens the door then stops in surprise
Driver stands there
You got a minute
She looks at him in a daze
Where have you been
He stares back at her in silence

Standard's been - know
His eyes stay on her, as if he's trying to tell her something more
She looks confused, staring back at him curiously when a small voice interrupts
/ Hey
Driver looks over at the little boy
Hey

Driver keeps staring at the boy but can't find any more words of comfort
Irene watches him, still stunned
He looks back at her

Great job
She walks faster now, striding towards the elevator
Driver follows her

Whatever you need - She turns around and slaps him hard
What are you, a bank
work for a living
don't need your widow's pension

Just tell me one thing
How did he talk you into it
He didn't talk me into anything
've been doing this my whole life
It's what  do
She stares at him in deep disappointment
Stupid me
She turns away when the elevator bell rings

Neither Driver or Irene recognizes him but we do

You're crazy

Because people like you never get out
And don't want my son to grow up like that
She holds his gaze with regret
Driver's about to respond when suddenly he catches a fleeting movement out of the corner of his eye
beat -- then he suddenly lunges -- grabbing Irene and pulling her to the ground
In the same instant Tan Suit appears out of the darkness, opening fire with his automatic
Bullets spark as they hit the concrete floor and the other parked vehicles
Driver drags Irene behind a car now, covering her with his body as Tan Suit fires another burst
More sparks light up the darkness, the bullets penetrating the car with ease, narrowly missing Driver and Irene
Driver moves again, dragging the terrified Irene behind him
Tan Suit loses sight of them in the darkness, striding past rows of parked cars

He holds her gaze apologetically, then gets to his feet and runs, trying to draw Tan Suit's fire
Tan Suit hears him and opens up again, more bullets lighting up the darkness
Driver keeps moving
Tan Suit strides after him, reloading, when suddenly his gun jams
Crouching behind another vehicle, Driver sees this and takes his chance, darting out after his pursuer
Tan Suit sees him coming and runs, the hunter becoming the hunted now
Still lying on the ground, Irene listens to their echoing footsteps
Driver runs after Tan Suit through the darkness, gaining all the time
Tan Suit looks desperate now, tiring
He turns to face his pursuer but Driver's on him in a flash, hurling him against a car
Tan Suit slams into the car, losing his balance
Driver grabs him, swinging him around, smashing him into another car
Irene's watching from the shadows, stunned by the violence
She picks herself up and runs towards the elevator
Driver keeps slamming Tan Suit against the car, beating the resistance out of him
As his body begins to slump, Driver grabs him by the throat and rams his head into a car window
The glass splinters with blood, the force of the blow shattering Tan Suit's skull
Driver looks around for Irene now and sees her standing in the elevator, framed against the light
She stares back at him, but makes no attempt to step out

Him and Nino are like brothers
told him you weren't interested in the money, that you only did it for the girl
(From the heart) wanted to make sure once you returned the money that was the end of it

They probably didn't listen to him - It's too late
Shannon says nothing now, knowing he's right
They're gonna come after you to find me
You have to leave
Shannon takes this in slowly
What are you gonna do

Mr
Paolozzi,  owe you this guy

Sun's in my eyes
Nino doesn't look at Cook, a clear indication he should do as he's told
Cook stands up, humiliated, and walks over to the windows
Bernie Rose waits for Nino to explain
The money belonged to a half assed wiseguy from Philly
had a tip-off he was keeping a million in a pawn shop and was gonna invest it here in , try to run a rival operation
wanted to teach him a lesson
The lights in the restaurant gradually fade as Cook shuts the blinds
() You stole from the East Coast mob
stole from a jumped up punk who was gonna step on our business - () 68 9/24/10 110 : 110 And where did this punk find a million dollars
You ever consider he may have consulted some higher-ups
You even bother to check
- don't give a fuck who gave him their blessing
This is my city - Your city
This is a big city, pal, and last time  checked we were partners
- We are partners - Then why the fuck didn't you come to me before you set up your dummy robbery or hired this fucking amateur
Cook sits back down at the table, having closed the blinds
Nino looks almost embarrassed for once
This was off to the side, Bernie
didn't wanna involve you
Well, now you fucked up  am involved
Anyone finds out you stole from the family they'll kill both of us - What family
These fucks still call me a kike to my face
'm fifty nine years old, they pinch my cheek, treat me like a fuckin' kid
They're the reason we left New York in the first place
Decrepit old men waving us over to their dinner and domino tables to complain
Those old men gave us the funds to move out here
And  made them a lotta money
made you a lotta money too
He stares at Bernie, genuinely indignant now

He calls Nino by his childhood name now, emphasizing the fact that they're both outsiders in this organization
For the first time Nino's tough guy act slips and he looks anxious
That's why this driver has to go
Him, and maybe your friend Shannon, are the only two people who can tie me to the robbery
What about this prick
He doesn't even bother to look at Cook
Mr
Paolozzi - Shut up
The two friends stare at each other as if Cook didn't exist
Are you asking my permission
'm asking for your help
shoulda' come to you first, Bernie
know that
We're a team
He stares at Bernie apologetically, appealing to their friendship
'll pay you back the three hundred you spent on the race car
It's not about the money
He stares out quietly, torn

Nino nods in gratitude
( ) Pass the salt
Cook hesitates, thinking Bernie's fucking with him for having two broken hands
He stares back dumbly and it's the final straw
Bernie suddenly grabs a stainless steel fork and rams it in his eye
As Cook screams, Bernie takes a knife and buries it in his neck
He twists the knife deeper for good measure, then with one powerful sweep of his arm clears Cook off the table
Cook's not dead yet, just writhing on the floor, choking on his own blood

What's this fucking kid to you anyway
Shannon shrugs, no idea himself
leave here without finding out where he is, there'll be others coming after me guarantee they'll be too stupid to figure out you won't talk and drag this out unnecessarily
Then 'm glad you got here first
Bernie Rose holds his gaze, then looks away, admiring the shiny stock car
You know, it's too bad,  was getting excited about our race team, having my name all over the car
think we could have made something of this business
Nah, 'd have fucked it up too

Bernie Rose grins, and extends his hand
They shake hands firmly, like old friends, when suddenly Shannon recoils, as if he's been stung
We see now that his shirt sleeve is covered in blood, his vein cut all the way from his elbow to his wrist
He looks dazed, paralysed with shock
Bernie Rose holds a razor knife in his hand, the blade wet with Shannon's blood
He takes Shannon gently by the arm and sits him down against the boot of the stock car
You won't feel a thing
Close your eyes and you'll fall asleep
Shannon stares out numbly, the life ebbing out of him
Bernie Rose watches him quietly, wiping his bloody razor with a handkerchief

From next door he can hear his neighbors arguing again
He stands there a moment, deflated, then suddenly storms towards his front door

Bernie Rose's neighbor opens his door
Yeah
Bernie Rose, next apartment over - Yeah,  know
'm kind of busy here
heard
There's something threatening in the old mobster's eyes now
The husband moves to close the door but Bernie jams it open with his elbow, shoves him aside, then looks over at the wife
You all right, Shonda
The woman nods without meeting his eyes
Get the hell out of my - Bernie doesn't give him time to finish, clamping a powerful hand on his throat
What's your fucking name
- 'm a patient man, Lenny, not much for getting in other people's way
What figure is, we've all got our own lives, right
And the right to be left alone
( ) So  sit next door for almost a year now listening to what goes down in here and keep thinking, hey, they'll work it out
You gonna work it out, Lenny
() 74 9/24/10 111b : 111b He jerks the husband's neck forward, making him nod
You're lucky to have her, lucky she's put up with you this long
Lucky 've put up with you
She has good reason: she loves you
don't have any reason at all
So stop raising your voice or fucking move
He lets go of the terrified man and storms out again

112 Sunlight glints on the parked vehicles by the curb
Driver slows down as he approaches the sign for Shannon's Custom Kings, glancing out of the window to see if anyone's staking out the garage
Satisfied there's no-one there, he drives through
113

113 Driver pulls open the garage door and sees the rows of vintage cars shimmering in the shafts of sunlight
As he heads past the vehicles he suddenly spots a figure slumped against the stock car
Shannon's eyes have been closed, his head resting gently against the trunk of the car
Driver kneels down and lifts him up in his arms, holding him for a second, then lays him down on the floor
He turns back and opens the car boot now, revealing the black gym bag full of money

Nino's talking to his wife on the phone
Alright honey, 'll pick you up in an hour

116 Two big Lincoln Towncars are parked outside
Across the road we recognize Driver's car
He opens the trunk
When he closes it again we see that he's wearing the eerily convincing  mask
He crosses the road, entering the pizzeria

117 Several of Nino's men look up as Driver enters but none of them recognize him
' We're closed
Driver stares past them at Nino in the kitchen, surrounded by more of his men
We feel his mind calculating then he walks out again

118 Nino emerges with his bodyguards now, heading towards one of the white Lincolns
(To one of his men) 'm going to pick up my wife

Across the road Driver climbs into his car, still wearing the mask
He starts his car, setting off after Nino's Lincoln

He unbuckles his seat belt and crawls out of the twisted wreck

He sees Nino stumbling off towards the beach but doesn't hurry after him yet
He checks to make sure the other passengers are dead, then heads on

156 Nino stumbles through the sand, running for his life now
He looks behind him and sees Driver calmly pursuing him
He keeps running, but he's badly injured, slowing all the time
Fear clouds reason and he staggers towards the crashing waves
Driver slows down as he watches the gangster wade into the ocean, a pathetic last attempt to evade him
The crashing waves and the undertow are an impenetrable wall
Every time Nino tries to wade out further, the ocean drags him back
() 80 9/24/10 156 : 156 Driver stares at his trapped prey
Nino's attempts become more and more feeble as the ocean exhausts him and snuffs out any hope of escape
Finally he retreats back into the shallow water, barely able to keep his footing
He turns around and faces Driver, the crashing waves still smashing into his back
They stay like that for a moment
Gazing at each other
Driver silhouetted against the white sand
Nino trapped in the ocean
Then Driver wades out into the water
Nino has no fight left in him, staring at the masked man
Driver stares back at him then grabs him by the throat, forcing his head under the water
Nino splutters as Driver lets him up again
It was Bernie
Bernie Rose killed your friend not me
Driver shoves his face back under the water, keeping it there until Nino's body finally stops thrashing
157

157 phone shrills
Bernie Rose answers it
Nino
' He's dead
Bernie Rose stares out in silence
Whatever he thinks of Nino, a part of him has died
We feel the regret in his eyes but there's no trace of emotion in his voice
Looks like me, you and your girlfriend are the only pieces left on the board

158 Driver is no longer wearing a mask, framed against the ocean
He catches the veiled threat in Bernie's words but doesn't respond
'd say this has gone far enough
See any reason why it should go on
Doesn't have to

We follow Driver through the crowd
He sees Bernie Rose sitting at a table on his own, pouring himself a glass of wine
The mobster's dressed for the occasion, wearing a jacket and tie
He smiles at Driver as he sits down
Care for a glass
Driver doesn't smile, gazing back at him across the table
Bernie Rose doesn't seem to care
can recommend the duck
Hell,  can recommend everything -- Walnut prawns, shredded beef, Velvet chicken -- but the duck's to die for
He delivers the last line with a pointed smile, then turns away, calling over a
The duck, please
For two
Anything else
No, thanks
He waits for the waitress to leave, then turns back to Driver
You've been on a roll
Cut yourself quite a swath out there
() 82 9/24/10 160 : 160 never asked for any of it
We usually don't
But it comes down on our heads regardless
Look at Shannon
Driver holds his gaze, the tension palpable, laughter and conversation drifting over from the other tables
Anyway it's water under the bridge now
Question is where does that leave us
That's up to you
You bring the cash
Driver nods
Bernie Rose studies him quietly
Tell me something, how does someone with no interest in money get mixed up in a heist
(Off his silence) Shannon told me it was because of the girl
Driver hesitates, betraying a hint of concern
Bernie sees it and smiles
Don't worry
Nobody else knows about her
Just me
( ) You still see her
She's not interested
She's got her head screwed on right
got two ex-wives, three kids, four grandchildren
Not one of them speaks to me now
He smiles again, looking into Driver's eyes with just a hint of sympathy
This is what 'll do for you
You give me the money, nobody knows she exists
But it's a different matter with you
() () 83 9/24/10 160 : (2) 160 (cont'd) These people  have the misfortune to be involved with, they don't mind Nino being gone, but they'll wanna know what happened to him
Sounds like we have a problem
And just when we were getting to know each other
Their eyes are fixed on each other, deadly enemies but kindred spirits of a kind
We shake hands, say goodbye, it's the start of your new life
Sooner or later they'll come after you
No end to it
Someone gets tired, somebody else takes their place
It goes on and on
Whatever dreams you have, whatever plans, you might as well forget `em, because this is what it's gonna be like till the day you die
( ) just thought you should know
Driver stares back at him quietly
What do you suggest  do
First time  heard about you, Shannon told me you drove
Fast
That's a start
He keeps staring at Driver, then smiles
Either that or you choke on the duck

161 Driver's car is parked at the back of the parking lot, half hidden by a fenced area for garbage
Driver pops the trunk, taking out the black gym bag with the cash
Bernie Rose doesn't even look at it, still admiring the car
How much does something like this cost
Nine, ten thousand
If you can find one that still runs
() 84 9/24/10 161 : 161 Maybe 'll take yours
Part of our deal
He grins, then holds out his hand for the gym bag
Guess we won't be seeing each other again
Driver reaches out to give him the bag, when suddenly Bernie's hand snakes out of his pocket, twisting a switch-blade into Driver's gut
He pulls it out, ready to stab again, but this time Driver catches his wrist, slowly forcing the knife up to his throat
Their eyes are fixed on each other for a moment, with something like regret, then the blade pierces Bernie Rose's neck, sinking deeper and deeper
Driver holds the old man in his arms as he dies
They stay like that, locked in a fatal embrace, then Driver lowers Bernie Rose gently to the ground, out of sight
Blood seeping through his shirt, Driver picks up the gym bag and puts it back in the trunk, slamming the door shut

' Don't hang up
She says nothing but stays on the line
Driver continues painfully through the maze of cars
You got a pen

Irene looks confused as she hears the quiet urgency in his voice, then reaches inside her handbag
Sunlight glitters on the roofs of the parked cars, dazzling Driver's eyes

Keys are under the left rear wheel
What do you want me to do with it
Driver walks with difficulty, finding it hard to breathe
It's yours
It's safe to keep it
All around him the Chevys, Dodges, and Fords glitter in the sunlight
told you,  don't need your money
Blood seeps through Driver's shirt, dripping on the tarmac
Irene hears his labored breathing now, looking concerned
() 86 9/24/10 164 : (2) 164 Are you okay
Driver's skin looks deathly pale, his eyes a haunting shade of blue
He keeps walking through the maze of cars, casting his eyes from one vehicle to the next, looking for the perfect ride
Just out of breath
Finally he spots a beautiful white Camaro up ahead
How're you doing
For the first time we see the Echo Park fountain sparkling in the background
Fine
'm in the park with Benicio
Irene can no longer hold back her tears, heartbroken
Driver stops in front of the white Camaro, unsteady on his feet

Meeting you was the best thing that ever happened to me
Irene smiles sadly
It was nice to meet you too
