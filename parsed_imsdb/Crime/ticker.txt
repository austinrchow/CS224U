Margolis Original Draft: 11/10/97 1
-  -                1 Hot summer night
The flesh district - hookers working the sidewalks, stopping cars
, 20s, paces a corner, restless, looking for action
wet hair, three-day beard, trenchcoat, sneakers, heat-seeking weary eyes
He flashes a wad of bills in an effort to get some attention
no one notices
Across the street,  , 50's, a ragged transient, strolls over
Know what the problem is, kid
You're too ugly to get propositioned
Look who's talking, old man
'mon, it's a quiet night
Rice starts away
Reilly pauses, then trudges after him
2
-                                      2 Rice and Reilly pull donuts and coffee out of a bag, talk with their mouths full as they walk
Next week we work the park
gotta get back on top
Get off the sleaze detail
You will, one day at a time
'll be old and grey when it happens
11/10/97   2
They share a grin, pass a   who wears a pie-tin crown, holding her hand out to a  getting into a Cadillac
small gift, sir, for the Queen
The Pimp ignores her, screeches off
The Bag Lady pulls out a pad, adds his license number to a list, glances up at Rice and Reilly
(cont
) keep a record, see
They don't pay,  don't forget
Rice fishes some change out of his pocket
Here you go, your Highness
Thank you, officer
She pushes her shopping cart away
Rice and Reilly look at each other, crack up, surprised she knew he was a cop
So what'll you do
After they give you the gold watch
Hell,  got a gold watch
it just don't work
Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful
You don't fish
How hard can it be
The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping
11/10/97     3
You outta the city
that's a fish out of water
What's with all this family talk lately, anyway
One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit
When that happens, you'll wish you had family
No thanks
got close but it never woulda worked
They stop beside a dirty, beat-up Studebaker parked in the alley, climb in, Reilly behind the wheel
3                                                3 Cluttered with debris - clothes, boxes, personal items
Reilly jiggles the ignition - the engine coughs and sputters, finally turns over
Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery
What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty
thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it
She didn't work out, had to cut her loose
What was it this time
She wanted to cook me breakfast
11/10/97    4
The White Van appears up ahead and turns into a seemingly deserted building's garage
Reilly and Rice exchange a glance as they wait to see lights come on in the building
They don't
Two flashlight beams criss cross through the windows of the building briefly, then disappear
They hear a brief heated argument, that is cut short abruptly
Then silence
(cont
) 'mon, let's check it out
We're vice,  didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van
But if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up
Nah, let's just take a look-see
Reilly jumps out and heads for the building
Rice rolls his eyes, follows
4
-                                          4 huge, old, battered machine shop
Spooky darkness, dead quiet
Moonlight filters in through dirt-smeared windows
The door  as Reilly and Rice slip in, stop, eyes scan
Nothing
Just rows of glistening machines
Rice gestures for Reilly to spread out
They head in, footsteps echoing, shadows washing over them
Still nothing
deeper, deeper
then, glancing over, Reilly sees a shape hiding behind a machine
He steps towards it
The shape whirls - a beautiful spitfire of a  with piercing blue eyes
She tries to bolt
Reilly grabs her
She struggles, pulls a knife, slashes his arm, drawing blood through his trenchcoat
11/10/97   5
Ow
Son-of-a-bitch
He punches her full force in the face - she collapses, knocked out cold
Rice rushes over
You okay
Yeah, just a nick
Then, over Reilly's shoulder, Rice sees a dark emerging from behind a machine
Rice draws his pistol
Freeze
Police
As Reilly whirls, the Silhouette raises a Mac-11
Rice shoves Reilly aside as the Silhouette
Diving for cover, Reilly flings back his trenchcoat, whips out his 9mm and   at the Silhouette, blowing the shit out of windows behind, sparks showering off machines
Silence for an instant, Reilly looks for Rice and finds him bleeding to death on the floor nearby - he is completely exposed to the line of fire
The Silhouette and another    on Reilly
, 40s, crazy-brilliant, manic eyes
and one of his men, pale, sweaty, wearing an , 30s, continue the barrage
Swan fires   at a time at Rice, deliberately aiming not to kill him, trying to flush Reilly out
Rice screams as   into his legs
Reilly tries to reach him but can't, shots forcing him back
dark-eyed man with a  appears in the b
g
and stealths towards Reilly from behind
11/10/97   6
Reilly' face is in agony as Rice moans in pain
He glances urgently from the gunmen to the exit behind them, to The Girl lying next to him -- what's keeping them there
Obviously The Girl
She stirs
Desperate, Reilly grabs her by the hair, shoves his 9mm to her head
Using her as a shield, he drags her in front of Rice to protect him
(to gunmen) Drop it
Swan's eyes flare
He steps out into the open, gun aimed at Rice, eyes locked murderously on Reilly
Let her go
Reilly cocks his hammer, fingers trembling
The Girl stiffens, terrified
Beard emerges behind Reilly
Deadly silent, he raises an automatic, trying to get a clear shot between machines
(cont
) No, the girl
Reilly whirls, sees Beard, shrinks back to stay covered
(to Swan) We gotta get outta here
(to Swan) Tell them to drop it - now
deadly stalemate
Faraway
11/10/97   7
You have no idea how sorry you're going to be
(to The Girl) Don't worry
Beard smolders, Earring sweats
Keeping their guns up, the three men grab tool bags, work their way to the alley door and slip out
The moment they're gone, Reilly quickly handcuffs The Girl to a machine, kneels, cradles Rice
Mike
Don't talk
Take your time
one day at a time, kid
Rice takes Reilly's hand and pats it on his wristwatch
(cont
) It's all  got
it's yours
It don't work- (grinning) Ain't that a shit-- Rice's eyes go blank, he exhales his last breath
Reilly winces, eyes welling up
His gaze moves at the Girl
The Girl stares uncomfortably, a blink of sympathy stealing past her hard exterior
11/10/97    8

-                             5 Looking numb, out of place, Rice's blood still on his trenchcoat, Reilly walks in, weaves through a chaos of ringing phones, overworked cops, suspects being booked
Cops look up, whisper about him
Turning a corner, Reilly bumps into a bulldog of a cop, , hustling The Girl out of a booking room
She's got a shiner where Reilly hit her
The Girl and Reilly make eye contact, intimate somehow, a flash of vulnerability and fear in The Girl's face
Hey, Reilly, Captain's looking for you
Reilly snaps out of it, continues on
Reilly nods as Harry hustles the girl away
6
'  -                                    6 Behind his desk, a work-weary captain, , 50s, sucks coffee as he grills  , 40s, a slick suit-and- tie homicide detective
Prints
Nothing so far
What about the ballistics report
Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it
Reilly walks in
11/10/97   9
Captain
Reilly, what the hell happened out there
Why didn't you call for back-up
(at a loss, sad) Sir, -- Reilly looks at his watch (we notice he's now wearing Rice's watch)
He taps it, listens to see if it's ticking
(contid) (softening) Dammit, Rice was a good man, want to work this
You're vice, not homicide
Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved
But sir-- You know the rules
You're off the street `til
clears the investigation
Now go home and clean yourself up, get some rest
Harry barges in, dumps a bag of personal effects on the desk
She won't talk
Look at this shit, no
, nothing
Reilly picks up a twisted plastic-wire bracelet
11/10/97       10
What's that
Bracelet she was wearing
Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton
Maybe she knows your old man
Reilly sears into Pluchinsky
Take it down to the Bomb Squad, Artie- 'll do it
Winters eyes him for a beat, relents
Okay, kid
Run this down to the Cave
Reilly spins and exits quickly
7
-  -                           7 Emerging from a dingy back staircase, Reilly enters a hallway and moves to a door a door marked "
" 8
- " " -                         8 Reilly enters into another world - a dungeon cluttered with bomb paraphernalia, defusing equipment, a dog house, ping- pong table, Sheryl Crow pin-up, Chicago Bears posters, Yassir Arafat dartboard, a photo-shrine to dead Bomb Squaders
plain, fresh-faced assistant, , 30s, looks up from her computer station
11/10/97       11
May  help you
'm looking for the Bomb Squad
They're not here
Where are they
And you are
Officer Reilly, vice
There out on a call, perhaps  can help you- -Where
2600 block of Lakefront
limousine
But, - Thanks
Reilly sprints out
Bev tries to finish but he's gone
9
-                                          9 The Studebaker coughs and smokes in and out of traffic
10
-                                   10 young, uniformed police  stops Reilly in front of a cordoned-off section of the street
11/10/97   12
(flashes badge) Bomb Squad
The Officer nods and moves the barricade out of the way, Reilly hits the gas, rumbles through
The Studebaker swings past a fire truck, an ambulance, and two squads cars
Two  stand near a building with a worried and his
Reilly parks 50 yards from a limo stopped in the middle of the street
Bomb Squad van and sleek black Harley Davidson parked beyond it
Reilly hops out, heads cautiously for the limo , 50s, a barrel-chested ex-football player is on his hands and knees looking under the limo
Red rubber ball in hand, Hawaiian shirt half-tucked in, he leads around an equally scruffy Labrador Retriever,
Smell anything, Schnoz
Me, neither
, 20s, a country boy inspects the open trunk
, 40s, clean-cut, straight-laced, easy-going smile, brilliant leader of the team, steps lightly around the open driver's door
(contid) (cont
) Schnoz, come here, boy
Shhh,  hear something
Reilly stands off 25 feet
Glass notices him
Who the heck're you
11/10/97   13
You the Bomb Squad
No, we're terrorists, stay back or we'll blow
We're a bit busy at the moment, 'll give you a statement in a few minutes if we're still alive
(flashes badge) Reilly, Vice
- Quiet
Glass and Pooch step lightly to the rear of the limo where has discovered a shoebox wedged next to the spare tire
leans down, puts his ear to it, nods
(cont
) Ticker
Pooch lifts up Schnoz and holds him over the trunk
Schnoz sniffs the shoebox, whines
Schnoz says it's loaded
Good boy, Schnozzie
Pooch lowers Schnoz back to the ground throws him the red ball, and trots back to the van, climbs up inside and sits, watching
Alright boys, look close
Let's assess
Glass, Pooch and
take a beat just to look at the shoebox
Then, Glass nods for Reilly to move away
11/10/97        14
Reilly takes a few steps back, watching as the team works together - Glass in charge - a psychic connection between them as they pass tools back and forth like surgeons
Whadaya think, "boy" or "girl"
Glass puts on magnifying spectacles -- precise, organized, a detail freak as he uses a wooden probe to test the box for wires, sensors
As the others watch, Glass rubs his fingertips ritualistically and carefully eases the top off the box
He reaches in
Grabs something
Slowly pulls it out
It's a Mickey Mouse alarm clock doll, a clump of unlit firecrackers taped between Mickey's legs
The Bomb Squaders whoop and howl - all except Pooch who pulls out a pack of Tums, shoves half of it in his mouth
It's a "girl"
They all crack up, hysterical
Reilly stares in disbelief -- these guys are nuts
11     -                                  11 In the b
g
, the Officers finish getting a statement from the Businessman as the still-worried Chauffeur inspects the limo
and Pooch load their equipment into the van as Glass fills out paperwork
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that
11/10/97   15
No shit
better send Meg flowers just in case
and Pooch share a laugh as Reilly approaches
Who's in charge here
Pooch points to Schnoz
He is
Look, it's important
Make an appointment
It's about this
Reilly holds up the bracelet
Glass takes it, frowns
Where did you get this
Off a girl's wrist
suspect
What
High-grade det cord
This girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition
11/10/97   16
What do you mean
Glass whips out a blasting cap from his utility belt, cuts off a piece of the bracelet, plugs it in
Fire in the hole
Glass tosses it into a sewer drain
beat, then a small , smoke billows out of the gutter drain
The nearby Officers jump, alarmed
The Bomb Squad guys laugh
Glass waves to the Officers
Sorry about that
(to Reilly) That's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do
Thanks
He grabs back the bracelet, turns to leave
Hey wait a minute- Reilly jogs back to his Studebaker, climbs in and roars off in a cloud of dirty smoke
Vice
Jesus
That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on
Pooch and
share a laugh as Glass shakes his head, climbs on his Harley
The others pile into the van
Glass kicks-starts his hog and rumbles away, van following
11/10/97       17
12
-                                                   12 Thin crowd of day-time drinkers
Earring walks in, moves to a booth where Swan and Beard are eating
Earring pulls out a Gallois (French) cigarette, lights up from a book of matches
They're holding her downtown
What about the cop
Earring shrugs
If you'd let me waste him
What if she talks
She won't
say we split town
Come back to this job when things cool
We've got other contracts - Denver, Seattle
Swan slams his fist down, spilling food
No one in bar even looks up from their drink
want her back and we do the job
thought we agreed, the personal can't interfere with the professional
Besides, we're on a schedule and the cops won't let her go
11/10/97        18
Unless we make them
Hey
Earring stares uneasily
Swan and Beard look up, freeze pair of   are heading directly towards them
Earring reaches under his jacket
Swan grabs Earring's arm, calming him
The Cops keep coming, then at the last moment, they veer left and slide into a booth
Swan nods, they get up and casually slip outside
13
-   -                          13 Reilly hurries in, interrupts Winters and Pluchinsky talking over Pluchinsky's desk
Captain- An  shouts from across the room, holding up a phone
Captain, line one
(to Reilly) thought  told you-- He says it's important, something about the Rice shooting
Winters snatches up the nearest phone
Winters
11/10/97   19
He listens, facial expression changing, getting tight
(cont
) What
He punches an intercom button - the whole room stops, looks up, as Swan's voice comes over the squawk box
' said release the girl or alot of people are going to die
Winters signals frantically for the call to be traced -- cops spring into action
'  (contid) (cont
) It's exactly two o'clock
If she's not released in one hour, people die
Wait, what do you mean--
Click, the line goes dead
Winters slams down the phone - no chance of a trace
(cont
) Shit
What the hell was that
ticking bomb
What
(holds up bracelet) It's detonation cord, for a bomb
11/10/97     20
It's a bluff
The guy's full of crap
We can't take the chance
Ring down to the Bomb Squad
want them on alert
'll do it
Goddamit, Reilly-- Look,  saw these guys,  can i
d
them
know you're anxious to get back but
just stay out of homicide's way or 'll have you classifying fingerprints, understand
Yes, sir
Reilly takes off, Pluchinsky glares
14
-                                            14 is hunched over a twisted mess of wires, untangling them
Pooch taste-tests dog biscuits for Schnoz, then feeds them to him, as he talks to his wife on the phone
Glass is dissecting the Mickey Mouse clock
No, honey, 'm fine
Yeah, well, you're welcome
You deserve flowers more often
Bev glances longingly at
as she gives Glass a neck rub
Bev, you're the greatest
11/10/97   21
Hey, 'm next
winks as Bev turns away, hard to get
Reilly bursts in
Hey, that's the guy- We just got a bomb threat upstairs
This gets everyone's attention
(cont
) cop was killed last night interrupting a robbery
One of the gang was grabbed, a girl
The one  told you about with the detonation cord
Well, her friends just called in, they're threatening to waste people unless she's released in the next hour
Alright, let's check it out
We can start in the area where the robbery occurred
Vice cop on a homicide
Captain assigned me to assist you
Assist
What the hell you know about tickers anyway
Easy, guys
(to Reilly) () 11/10/97   22
(cont
) Look, nothing personal, but you can't just waltz in here and expect to join the team
What're you talking about
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department
We've got one hour
Are you coming or not
The Squad just stands there
(cont
) Okay, fuck you
Reilly walks out
The guys look at each other
Glass frowns at the bracelet
Those vice cops, around all that pussy, so pent up
Bev smirks at
's language, he lowers his eyes
(to Glass) What do you think
Call upstairs, see what you can find out
Right
(re: bracelet) , run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from
Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk
11/10/97       23
15
-                                              15 Reilly's Studebaker is parked next to the machine shop building
16
-   -                            16 Reilly enters and slowly re-walks his steps from the shoot- out, pausing over the chalk outline of Rice's body
Two   silently comb over the crime scene
Reilly pauses, sadness overwhelming him
One of the Officers nods at him, he has to turn away as the emotions come
17
-  -                              17 Sophisticated detonation equipment and weapons cover the beds
Beard scowls, Earring sweats as Swan puts the finishing touches on a computerized briefcase bomb
What time is it
Twenty after
Swan, it's no use
Look, we can still make Houston-- Shut up
He sets a timer, closes the briefcase, smiles
18
-                                     18 Sleazy area
Briefcase in hand, Earring slips out and blends into pedestrian traffic
11/10/97        24
19
-                                         19 Earring walks on, just a man with a briefcase
20
-                                      20 Earring slows and passes a bus stop where a group of giggly are waiting
He notices a raven-haired  going into the pub up ahead
He grins and follows her in
21
-                                                 21 trendy Irish Pub, a sparse lunch crowd
Earring enters, spots the Knockout ordering a drink at the bar, slides onto a stool next to her, and deposits the briefcase on the floor
Hey, beautiful, can  buy you some bangers and mash
Pint of Guiness
She gives him a once-over, turns up her nose, nods a `thanks' to the Bartender delivering her white wine
Earring's smile doesn't change
(cont
) Last chance
You know, even the smallest choices in life could change everything
Fuck off, pal
Earring grins and shrugs an `oh well'
He slides off the stool, steps back, and exits
leaving the briefcase behind
- Earring walks out and strolls off
He checks his watch, picks up the pace
He disappears around a corner
Cars pass
People stroll by
Nothing happens
11/10/97    25
An ordinary scene on an ordinary day
The silence is screaming
Suddenly - the bar
the front window, showering the street with wood and
22
-  -                                           22 Chaotic aftermath of the bombing
sirens, flashing red lights
Police hold back onlookers, Firemen clean up, Paramedics carry corpses and moaning Victims out of the charred, smoking ruins, into waiting ambulances
black-and-white tears up
Capt
Winters leaps out, pushes through to a dirt-covered
Eight dead, so far
Winters looks grim
23                                                       23 Reilly  up in his Studebaker, jumps out, pushes through, flashes his badge, enters the police zone
He stops as he sees a bloody   being loaded into an ambulance
Suddenly a voice snaps him out of it
What're you doing here
Reilly faces him
(cont
) You're offsides
Beat it
Reilly ignores them, starts towards the ruins
Pluchinsky shoves him back
(cont
) said get the fuck outta here
11/10/97   26
You touch me again and-- And what, you'll shoot me
Hey, don't mistake me for one of your partners, 'd like to make retirement in one piece
Pluchinsky starts to laugh as Reilly pops him once hard in the face
Pluchinsky staggers backwards, grasping his bleeding nose
Reilly is ready for more as Pluchinsky starts at him
They exchange a few body shots before several cops swarm in and pull them apart
Winters hustles over
What the hell's going on
Son-of-a-bitch
my nose
This fuck-up is interfering with- Reilly, what're you doing here
Sir
thought  told you-- (
) He's with us
They all turn
Glass and
stand there, soot-smeared, wearing utility belts
(cont
) We asked him to come
11/10/97   27
Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on this thing
Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner
(to Reilly) Coming
Reilly looks at the Captain awkwardly
Go ahead, kid
Reilly marches after Glass and
, leaving Pluchinsky fuming, holding closed his bloody nose
'm filing charges against that mother- Can it, Pluchinsky
And shove some cotton up your nose
- Reilly follows Glass and
, bewildered
What was-
Why
That cop who bought it
you didn't tell us he was your partner
We've lost brothers too, we know what that's like
11/10/97      28
Let's get something straight
We're doing you a favor
You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives
What
This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery
You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand
Now wait just a fucking- Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers
And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive
Reilly glares, tongue-tied, as they walk past the Bomb Squad van and Glass' Harley, enter the wreckage
24
-                                                24 Smoky hell
Two Firemen drag out a fire hose
Glass,
and Reilly approach a taped-off area where Pooch is on his hands and knees, wet and dirty as he searchs for clues
Schnoz sits nearby, red ball in his mouth
By the way, 'm Glass
This is
, and Pooch
Mike Reilly
(offering dirty hand) Uh-huh
Reilly avoids the hand
11/10/97   29
That there's Schnoz, mascot and ace bomb sniffer
Say hi, Schnozzie
Schnoz ignores them, sniffing a charred beam in a corner
points out burn patterns to Glass
Flame racer, partial
See this wave pattern
Definitely self-contained
Pooch sniffs dirt, tastes it
Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil
What kind of bomb was it
Device
Huh
We don't use the b-word
Bad luck
So you're the "Device Squad"
and you defuse "devices"
Treat
We treat devices
(amused) Anything else  should know
Don't push it, slick
11/10/97   30
Schnoz whines and paws at something under the beam
They scramble over
Pooch, can you move it
don't know
Pooch positions himself like a weight-lifter preparing to dead-lift
He growls as he strains to lift the beam out of the way
Glass and
jump in and go to work with toothbrushes and tweezers
As Reilly watches, fascinated, they uncover a scorched fragment of a briefcase handle
Yes, baby, yes
Pooch throws Schnoz the red ball
Good boy, Schnoz
Daddy loves you
Scorch marks
looks like they used silly putty
Reilly looks to Glass for an explanation
C4, plastic explosive
Helluva fuck factor
Reilly again looks for an explanation
(cont
) Don't worry, you'll pick it up
11/10/97    31
Hey, check this out
Something glitters in the ashes
Pooch picks it up with tweezers
tiny chip
The guys stare at it, puzzled
Lemme see that
Glass takes it, puts on his magnifying spectacles, holds it up to the light, frowns
(cont
) Hardware
Computer device
Unlikely
Probably, cash register or something
Pooch and
go back to searching
(cont
) What can you tell us about the girl with the exploding jewelry
Glass turns to see Reilly on his way out
'll get back to you
25
-                               25 Phones are ringing off the hook
Reilly bursts in, notices Winters directing an army of cops setting up sophisticated tracing equipment
Let's go, we gotta jump on him the second he calls again
11/10/97   32
Reilly discreetly crosses the room but is intercepted by Pluchinsky
You were lucky today, vice boy
Captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, 'm watching you
'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type
Pluchinsky's face turns red with rage as
An  holds up a phone urgently
Captain, it's him
The room scrambles into action as Winters grabs the phone
Swan's voice crackles over the squawk box
Winters here
' Don't make me send another
Look, we're prepared to talk, what do you want--
Click, dial tone
(cont
) Hello
Hello
Winters slams down the receiver
Cops pull off their tracing headphones, glance at each other uneasily
(cont
) Section commanders, in my office, now
11/10/97      33
As the room erupts, Reilly turns to the
Where's the girl
The one  brought in
Upstairs, interrogation
Reilly takes off
26
-    -       26 Wearing headphones connected to a tape recorder, a flips wearily through a comic book in front of a one-way mirror
Through it can be seen a bare interrogation room where The Girl sits stubbornly at a table across from Harry
Stubbing a butt into an overflowing ashtray, Harry rubs the back of his neck, gets up and goes through a door, into the viewing booth
The Bored Cop looks up, shuts off the tape recorder
Three hours
She's tough
Tough
Tough is "Fuck you, where's my lawyer
"
This chick doesn't say boo
The outer door opens, Reilly walks in
Any luck
Bupkiss
Sorry about Rice
Reilly nods, accepts the condolence
Captain said  could give it a crack
11/10/97      34
She ain't no hooker
This is a murder investigation
She was my collar
Maybe 'll get lucky
But, if you got a problem with that, talk to the Captain
'll be in the can
Harry exits
The Bored Cop eyes Reilly suspiciously as Reilly crosses to the other door, yanks it open
27
27 As Reilly enters, The Girl stiffens at the sight of him
You remember me
Reilly shuts the door, she doesn't respond
The Girl catches a glimpse of his 9mm under his trenchcoat, she's unfazed
He paces, circling her
(cont
) You know, your boyfriend just killed a ten year old at a bus stop, blew her head clean off
The Girl puts up a good front but we can see she's listening
(cont
) You're scared
You're just caught in the middle
But, we've got a guy out there wasting people just to get you back
Why
It can't be because of your looks
So, 'll be honest with you - Reilly goes to the table, flicks off the mic
11/10/97       35
28
28 The Bored Cop doesn't notice, he's engrossed in his comic
29
29 Reilly sits, the Girl eyes him like a trapped prey
They're enemies, yet there's a strange chemistry between them
Let me be very clear about this
The police won't let you go
When your boyfriend realizes this,  have a feeling a lot of innocent people are going to die
Kids, families
know you don't want that to happen
She stares, eyes dark, barely registering any emotion at all
flicker of fear, indecision
Her lips part, fighting it, then she looks away, letting the fear win
Reilly flushes with anger, frustration
30
-                                            30 Glass squints through a microscope
Pooch sniffs and fumbles dirt samples
rocks to a Walkman as he inspects the charred briefcase handle fragment
Bev is at her computer searching luggage websites on the Net
Reilly comes in, still frustrated
We missed you, where'd you go
Before Reilly can answer,
rips off his headphones
Fuckin ,  think  got two partial prints here
Awright
How bout you, Glass, how's that chip shaking
11/10/97   36
They all look over
Glass stares back darkly
Glass, what is it
was wrong
this didn't come from any cash register
Whadaya mean
It's from an
Oh shit
what
- instant retirement account
device
Deadliest class of tickers in existence
Computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works
First showed up in a series of
bombings in London couple years ago
One of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers
The Girl, is she Irish
She's not talking
But, she could be
So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before
Only once, at Redstone
Where
11/10/97   37
That's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it
Shit
We're fucked
Relax, Pooch, it's just a ticker, it's not personal
Let's face it, we all knew it would happen sooner or later
The guy who can build a mousetrap that's better than we are
Stop it
(points to Reilly) And what's he doing to help
Shut up,
Be nice Pooch
They all explode into a   (except Glass who is in his own world inspecting the microchip an inch from his eyes)
moments mayhem until- All of you, shut the fuck up
They all go silent, stare at Reilly (except Glass)
(cont
) No wonder the rest of the department doesn't want to work with you
You're nothing but a bunch of
punks
11/10/97    38
Reilly walks out
31
-                               31 Reilly goes to his Studebaker, climbs in
32
32 As he starts it up, the passenger door rips open
Glass jumps in, slams the door, furious
Nice performance back there
Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar
Hey, look-- No you look, mister
First, you don't go calling my men names
It's bad for morale
Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did
Oh yeah
Prove it
(beat) Drive
Glass glares, a challenge
Glaring back, Reilly guns the engine, screeches away
33
-                                            33 The Studebaker rumbles up to the machine shop, parks in the same haunting spot as the night before
Glass and Reilly climb out of the car, flashlights in hand
Reilly glances around, bad memories stirring up
11/10/97     39
The place has already be combed
Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside
Then let's go see what they missed
Pulling out a tool kit, Glass quickly picks the door lock, yanks open the door, ducks inside
Reilly follows
34
-                                 34 Nearly pitch dark inside, shafts of late afternoon sunlight glistens on the battered machines
Shadows wash over Reilly and Glass as they retrace the path Reilly and Rice took the night before, Glass searching intensely, Reilly getting more and more uncomfortable
So what were they doing here
don't know
You tell me
An abandoned machine shop
nice place to build devices
Low rent, too
But, you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout
You mentioned something called Redstone
Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers
Cream of the crop, huh
You
11/10/97   40
(nods) Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much
Then off to Redstone
First half of the course we learned how to build devices
second half, we'd take them apart
Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs
Sounds like terrorist heaven
There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones
'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around
Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course
Just how easy is it to build a
device
With a little training, you could go into a house and just from stuff in the bathroom and kitchen make something that'd finish off that alleged car of yours
Heck, didn't you ever watch MacGyver
Reilly looks at Glass strangely until he realizes they've stopped where Rice died
(cont
) So this is where it happened
Reilly fights the memory
eyes well up, his hand trembles ever so slightly as he points out
Girl was here
The guy in charge was over there with one of his men, the other one was back there
11/10/97   41
Glass gets down on his hands and knees, scans the floor
Reilly talks to distract himself
(cont
) Bombers, what kettle of fish are they
Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims
They like scaring people
That's why they call in their threats
Same mentality as obscene phone callers
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along
No, ninety-ninety percent of them are full of baloney
They're into the power trip, not the damage
What scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants, then disappear
The worst of the bunch, they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever
and they love the carnage
Glass lays out flat on his stomach and searches deep under a machine, picks up a half-smoked cigarette butt with tweezers, pulls it out, kneels
(cont
) Hello
Glass straightens it out, reads the brand name, "Gallois"
(cont
) French
Doubt somebody who worked here smoked it
Only half gone, put it out in a hurry
(glances around) () 11/10/97       42
(cont
) Figuring the length, assuming it was one of these guys, odds are
it was lit outside
Glass takes off
Reilly follows
35
-  -                          35 Glass and Reilly search the area
Glass moves on his knees, aiming the flashlight
This is where the van was parked
Yep
Then, it's gotta be here somewhere
Look, it's a longshot
Bingo
Glass pinches something with his tweezers, holds it up triumphantly
a used match
- jungle of giant fibers teeming with strange molecules
(
) No question, it was definitely the one used to l-light the butt
Finger pressure suggests a male, average build, height
no prints, trace of nylon fiber
he wore a glove
36
-                                       36 punches keys on a computer, peers through the microscope as Glass, Reilly, Pooch and Bev stand by
11/10/97   43
This is strange
Two computer screens - one displays the magnified match from different angles, the other spills out a stream of formulae and chemical breakdowns
(cont
) (reading info) Three foreign particles
vulcanized rubber
resin
nitro-cellulose
Nitro-cellulose
What is that, some kind of explosive
Industrial wood oil
Separately, any one of these things could lead in several directions, but together
Ka-Boooom
They make bowling balls out of vulcanized rubber
Resin
Lane oil
(beat, proud of his team) bowling alley
At an adjacent computer, Bev runs a scan program on the match, comparing it against an endless stream of match types on file
Schnoz howls awake from a nap as
stabs the screen as a match is made, specifications filling the screen
11/10/97     44
Got it
Ace Match Company, Flint, Michigan
(amazed) You mean you just--
You keep a record of
matches
Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line of work
(smirks at Reilly) "Punks", huh
Bev, give `em a call, find out what bowling alleys they supply in this area
Right
Pooch, why don't you e-mail your buddies at Langley and on the other side of the pond, see if any IRAs been popping up lately
You got it
(to Reilly) We work fast enough for you
Reilly mouth is opened, duly impressed
37
-                             37 The Studebaker and Harley swerve up to a run-down, windowless bowling alley, park in a red zone
Reilly and
, climb out of the clunker, Glass off his bike
11/10/97      45
checks his hair in the side mirror, sniffs his underarms
, what're you doing
My first undercover assignment
gotta look good, right
Reilly and Glass exchange a grin, they drag
inside
38
-                            38 busy Saturday afternoon crowd
Rock music blasts, reverberating with the echo of crashing balls and pins
The lanes are teeming with sweating bodies
Sexy waitresses in skimpy outfits deliver drinks
ogles women as they wander through
So what're we looking for
Someone who smokes French cigarettes
In this crowd
It's gonna be Marlboros, Camels, and maybe a few Kools
Reilly and Glass nod, knowing it's a longshot
Reilly directs Glass and
to split up to case the place
They move through the rowdy crowd, eyes catching every smoker
39
-  / -                      39 The music is more redneck-rock, the crowd as well
11/10/97   46
Glass and
are in the midst of game of pool, nursing bottles of Root Beer
They continue to play while eyeing those coming and going
Reilly enters from the alley, catches Glass' eye and shakes his head
He goes to the bar and orders a coke
He takes the drink and moves over next to Glass as
lines up a shot
How long are we going to stay
`Til we get a better lead
Reilly's attention is drawn to a crowded booth in the corner where a few bowling alley girls block the view of the entire booth
Glass nudges Reilly, they look over to see Pooch entering the bar
He sees them and moves to the bar
sinks his shot and lines up another as Reilly and Glass move to meet Pooch
Pooch produces a printout from his jacket, opens it up
Unsolved bombings in the last year
Boston, New York, Philadelphia
but no real match Insurance
Political
Exactly my thinking
Except, none of the targets can actually be linked to government, political or special interest concerns
They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies
Some insured, some not
() 11/10/97   47
(cont
) But there's traces of C4 and assorted inflammatory additives found in each case
The only common denominator is the detonators all had circuitry consistent with our micro- chip
Not bad for Bomb squad, eh
What not bad
You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked
Right
Well
it's more than we had ten minutes ago
got a friend over at Scotland Yard who's gonna try and reach out to a undercover guy who would know if any of the rightwingers are circulating over here
Bev's following up on the briefcase manufacturers, too
comes over
Pooch, you're up
Rack `em
They look over to the pool table to see only the cue ball left
(cont
) Boss, you're buying the next round
sets his empty Root Beer bottle on the bar
How're you guys doing
11/10/97   48
Still waiting for a miracle
Go ahead
Pooch and
head back to the pool table where two comely Gals have begun putting the balls back onto the table
turns on his smile and chats them up
(cont
) Quite a team you've got, where'd you find them
It's a small fraternity, everyone knows everyone
'm always recruiting
Pooch is ex- , military expert
claymores, grenades
He played linebacker at Boston College, worked a -9 unit - that led him to the Bomb Squad
great nose, lousy fingers, we try to keep him away from the tickers
is a heck of chemist, Texas & engineering degree
Found him in a Militia chat room - turns out we were both monitoring the same groups
Bev is the natural born hacker, we stole her from dispatch
She had the Cave reorganized and ultra-high-tech in two months
Captain has no idea how much hardware she's "found" for us
You guys seem pretty tight
We've gotta be
In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments
Why do you do it
don't know, it's strange
it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it
See, when you beat one of these things
() 11/10/97   49
(cont
) there's that one second when you realize you saw something you weren't supposed to see
this beautiful naked woman
Death
and then the rush comes, the high, cuz you realize you got away with it
returns, shrugs
Lesbians
Pooch is still with the girls, showing one of them how to line up a shot
Looks like Pooch's doing okay
He's married, he don't even know what a lesbian is
waves over the Bartender
He and Glass orders fresh drinks as Reilly eyes pretty Blonde across the bar
She picks up two beers and grabs a pack of matches off the bar
She turns and moves to the booth in the corner
The bodies part and Reilly catches a glimpse of Earring
Reilly nearly chokes on his coke as Earring takes the matches from the Blonde
Earring checks his watches, rises
He looks up and catches Reilly's eye - he smiles--then bolts
Reilly coughs up his drink and tries to get a word out, pointing as Earring slips out the exit door next to the booth
Glass pats Reilly's back as he gags, eyes blazing
Finally
There he goes
He was here the whole time
11/10/97       50
Reilly pushes his way through the crowd with Glass on his heels
rushes over and grabs Pooch away from the Girls at the pool table
Reilly runs into a pair of enormous Rednecks, spilling their beer on them
The Rednecks grab him by the collar and prepare to fight as Pooch arrives and body-blocks the Rednecks away from Reilly
Reilly is released and he continues after Earring as Pooch and the Rednecks mix it up
brawl breaks out with Pooch and
in the middle as Reilly and Glass make it to the exit door
Reilly flies out- but Glass  dead in his tracks
He spins back to look at the corner booth
sits on the floor under the table
Glass tenses
The fight escalates quickly, but Pooch employs his linebacker skills and cuts down his assailant
and
a natural streetfighting-rabbit-puncher
They quickly dispatch the Rednecks, leaving them bruised and bloodied
they rush for Glass and the doorway--then lock on Glass' reaction and stop
40
-                                      40 Reilly runs out into the middle of the street
At the end of the block, Earring is rushing for the corner
Reilly draws his 9mm, aims thru the pedestrian--and fires
Earring is blown off his feet
He hits the pavement hard
11/10/97       51
41
41 Reilly enters and sees Glass,  and Pooch gathered around the booth in back
Say, thanks for the back up-- The bomb squad ignores Reilly, who now realizes something is wrong
He pushes his way through the bar patrons to the booth
Glass glances up at Reilly
He set one, the son-of-a
and Pooch exchange looks--they've never heard Glass so close to swearing before
notices a small crowd starting to gather around the booth
(calmly) Clear the area, please
Nobody moves
(loudly) You heard him, get the fuck away, it's a bomb
That does it, the crowds shriek and scatter
Rolling eyes at each other, the Bomb Squaders turn their attention to the shopping bag sitting on the floor
Alright
Let's assess
The team eyes the package for a moment
11/10/97   52
Glass makes a determination, whips out a knife, slashes the bag open, revealing a computerized nightmare of a bomb inside
rubs his temples with dread
Glass puts on his magnifying spectacles, starts to probe
Reilly returns
Pooch tests hinges with his tweezers
hands Glass a crimp
Pooch pries off a back panel, fingers shaking, lifts it every so slightly, sees complex circuitry inside, the red glow of a digital readout counting down
Oh shit
Fuck factor ten
Okay, 'm going in, nobody breathe
Synchronizing his chronometer to the counter, Glass begins disengaging sensor switches
(cont
) Altimeter
choking coil
mercury switch
He clips off circuits and booby traps with bloodcurdling care, peeling away layer after layer of death
shakes his head with awe, respect, fear
(cont
) Triple
brilliant
this guy's a master
Finally he comes to the heart of the bomb, a pair of tiny wires leading to the blasting cap, one yellow, one red
Precious seconds tick away
11/10/97   53
(cont
) It's one of these wires
So cut both
One shuts it down, one turns arms it
Which one's which
don't know
There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire
Reilly gulps
The device teeters, slightly, alarming
and Pooch
Glass nods
and Pooch each grab a corner of the device to steady it
Reilly follows their lead and kneels, goes to reach for a corner as well, one hand starts to tremble
(cont
) You can go back to the van if you like
No, 'm with you
Reilly focuses and wills his hands to steady
He grabs a corner and closes his eyes, mind over matter
Sweat streams as he concentrates like never before
Pooch and
stare at the wires with intensity
15 seconds, 14, 13,
Glass pulls out a clipper
12, 11, 10
He eases the clipper into position
9, 8, 7
He draws in a breath
Closing his eyes, he clips the yellow wire
Reilly's eyes snap open
11/10/97       54
The counter stops on 4 - no explosion
Pooch and
whoop and hug like drunk madmen
Glass steps away, stone-faced
Reilly follows him, wobbly
(cont
) You okay
(smiles) Is this a great job or what
42
-                                     42 Two squad cars have appeared, Officers cordon off the crime scene
Glass watches Reilly kneeling over Earring's body digging through Earring's pockets, finding nothing but cash, cigarettes and matches
(at Glass) Nothing
Nothing traceable
Pooch and
have the device on the ground a few feet away from the Earring's body
They delicately continue to take it apart so it can be transported safely
Schnoz sits nearby, watching
Pooch is on the phone with his wife
don't know, honey
'll see
No, everything's fine, it was nothing
As he says this, he lifts a chunk of C4 and sets it aside
Pooch hangs up his phone
Pooch and  exit the bar, moving to Glass and Reilly
11/10/97     55
(cont
) You guys hungry
The wife's got a heap of lasagna leftover
(at Reilly) What do ay say
Meg's lasagna
Good eats, Reilly
'mon
Glass notes Reilly's hands
(cont
) Good meal would go a long way to steady your system
Got work to do, don't we
Pooch scribbles down an address on a scrap of paper from the device's shopping bag, hands it to Reilly, offering a smile
In case you change your mind
Reilly looks at it awkwardly, then walks away as a News van arrives on the scene

Reilly drops a sheaf of papers on his desk
What's this
Report on the case so far
You know after a shooting  would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean
Yes, sir
But from now on, any leads on this case go to Pluchinsky
He's primary investigator and you are unofficially assigned to the Bomb Squad
you and your new friends are not to be playing detective any more
Got it
Reilly nods, accepting
(cont
) imagine as soon as they find out one of their's is dead, we'll be getting another call
So get some sleep, alright
Reilly nods, turns and exits

Swan watches the  report with Beard, eyes narrowing as he sees Reilly in the crowd behind the Reporter

Janie surprises Reilly with a shy kiss, scurries upstairs with after Pooch,
and Tommy
`Night
Meg clears the dishes, Schnoz is asleep on the floor
Glass and Reilly are left alone
Reilly takes a sip of coffee, hand trembles ever so slightly
How long were you hooked
What
11/10/97   59
You don't have to talk about it
Reilly stares, then opens up slowly
Pittsburgh, two years ago
Partner died, no back-up,  was too gung-ho
As usual
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second
know
was working a drug ring, deep cover
Played the part too well
When they pulled me out,  wasn't a cop anymore
My fiance had dumped me
Next thing  knew, was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance
He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me
Your partner
(nods sadly) guess  didn't realize how much  needed him
He kept me straight
It's been tough every second since
Reilly holds up his wristwatch
(cont
) This was his
Doesn't work for shit, but it's keeping me straight
Let me see
11/10/97       60
Reilly gives him the watch
Glass pulls out a mini tool kit, pries off the back of the watch examines the works
(cont
) Main spring's stuck
All you have to do is free the palate and realign the balance wheel
Here, you try
terrible with mechanical things
No you're not, you just don't understand them
Here, do what  tell you
He holds out the mini-kit
Reilly takes it uncertainly, but follows Glass' instructions
(cont
) Okay, first push the pin back with this
Good
Now while you keep it there, stick this in here and turn it slowly
Easy, that's it
Now let the pin go and line up the wheel
That should do it
Reilly gives it a tweak, looks at the watch, surprised
It's working
Congratulations, you just built your first ticker
Reilly throws Glass a surprised look

Okay, hit it
guns the engine, the Studebaker purrs like a tiger
Alright
We've created a monster
Glass glances at Pooch
Any word
Nothing

Bev answers it
Yes, sir

Reilly heads for the door

-                             52 strange, uncomfortable silence hangs over the squad room as Reilly weaves past cops smoking, drinking coffee, waiting
They all stare at him
Especially Pluchinsky

Winters hangs up

) got a call from upstairs
They say you questioned the girl
Yes, sir
She's refused to say a word to anyone
What made you think you could get her to talk
didn't
But  had to try
Reilly,  think 've shown that 'm a patient man
Rice was your biggest fan and 've tried to honor him by giving you some slack
But you are very close to running out of slack
Yes, sir
Winters lets this sink in, then holds up Reilly's report
read your report
Impressive
'd say it's got detective written all over it
But
you cross the line one more time
you're gone
Are we clear
Reilly, nods, shifts uncomfortably
(cont
) Now, that out of the way
The girl wants to talk to you, alone
Reilly is shocked

Reilly bolts off

Harry looks the Girl over, nods at Reilly

Reilly nods, Harry exits
Reilly sits down at the table opposite her
Hello
Hello

We were hired to take out some industrial sites

But they weren't all insured

No one was suppose to get hurt

Alex Swan
My brother
The other two are called Taylor and Leveau

Mary takes a deep breath, eyes welling
There is a motel downtown, near the Machine Shop
the Suncrest
Room 138
Thank you
He's my brother
Reilly rises and moves to her
Their eyes linger a moment, a bond between them
Then why tell me
People are dying
Reilly nods and touches her shoulder, a light squeeze
He turns and exits

Pluchinsky brings up the rear
After a beat, Pluchinsky re- emerges, shaking his head
Swan and Beard watch from behind a car
Beard gives Swan a dirty look and they quietly move off around the corner
Reilly and Glass are visibly disappointed
As the others grumble about it, Reilly notices someone across the street - the Bag Lady with the pie-tin crown, holding her hand out to a  getting into his car
The Man ignores her, screeches off
The Bag Lady scribbles down his license number in her pad
Glass follows Reilly's stare
Ex-girlfriend
Be right back
Reilly crosses the street, intercepts the Bag Lady as she's pushing her cart away
(cont
) Excuse me
'm looking for two men who were staying at the hotel over there - one has a beard, the other's tall, thin
You wouldn't happen to have seen them, would you
No
No, of course not
well, thanks anyway
Here you go, Your Highness
He fishes some change out of his pocket, hands it over, starts away
11/10/97    67
On second thought, maybe  did
He turns back
The Bag Lady flips through her pad, stabs an entry with her finger
Lemme see
yeah, here it is, 11:18 this morning
Very disrespectful
He used to drive a van, but he got a new car
You want the license number
She tears off the page, holds it out
You're beautiful
Reilly gives her a big kiss, races back to the Bomb Squad who've been watching
We're back in business
They all look at him like he's nuts

As he makes a left, Beard notices the Bomb Squad Van coming the other direction
We've got company

Reilly double-takes

Glass, there they are
Pooch right in front of you, you got `em, you got `em

Glass, up ahead tries to maneuver around slowing cars as
The Grenada speeds down a street right in front of the Bomb Squad Van
Pooch cranks into a turn and gives chase
Reilly and Glass are pinned in by other cars

66
-                                        66 The Grenada speeds up, heading towards the Police Station up ahead
The Bomb Squad Van appears and speeds up
Swan stands discreetly in a phone booth, watching as
Beard steers towards a parked Squad Car next to the Station - on collision course
At the last second, Beard dives from the moving car, hits the pavements and rolls
The Grenada  into the Squad Car
but no explosion
The Bomb Squad Van  to a stop as two uniformed Officers rush out of the Station
Beard has rolled to his feet and is now sprinting off down the street
11/10/97   71
Pooch and
jump out of the Van (leaving a  Schnoz inside) and sprint towards the Grenada, guns drawn
Pooch is quickly huffing and puffing
continues after Beard as Pooch moves towards the Grenada
The uniforms follow
Glass on his Harley appears from behind the Van
At the far end of the street the Studebaker rumbles into view, followed by a Squad Car, lights flashing
Everyone closing in on Beard
aims and yells at Beard
Police, freeze
Beard whirls around,  automatic weapon  at
and the Uniforms - they hit the pavement
few nearby Pedestrians  and drop to the ground
Reilly jumps out of his Studebaker as Beard turns his  on him,   his windshield
Back at the Grenada, Pooch ducks for cover by the open driver's door
Glass runs his Harley behind a parked car
The Squad Car behind Reilly  to a stop and as Beard shifts his aim,
and Reilly each    into Beard's torso
Beard spins around, drops - dead silence on the street
Relief all around
Everyone stands back up
's jaw drops at the sight of actually having hit the suspect with his bullets
Pooch exhales in relief, then hears  coming from the front seat of the car
He looks in to see the briefcase open, countdown ticking away
11/10/97      72
Oh

- '  -           67 Reilly stares off into space
Surreal silence, like a dream
Reilly looks at his watch, keeps his eyes low as he steals a glance at Glass in the other chair, face wracked with pain, loss
They both look through the glass office at the squad room outside, the sounds of reality fade in
phones ringing, voices shouting
a tense, chaotic emergency atmosphere
Reilly and Glass rise as Winters walks in, closes the door
He sits behind his desk, lights a cigarette
Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good man
We don't have time to give you a break right now, we're going ahead and- My God, you're going to use her, aren't you
(ignoring Reilly) Glass, you're to stand by with your team
11/10/97     73
promised her she'd be safe
It's our only option
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap
Reilly, you're done for now
What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit
They had no business- know
You've been at the center of two suspect fatalities and two Police Officer fatalities
'll need your badge and your weapon
Reilly looks at Glass, there'll be no stepping in this time
He glares at Winters, reaches into his jacket, pulls out the badge and tosses it on Winter's desk
He pulls out his 9mm, pops out the clip and open the chamber, sets it down
68
-   -                 68 Reilly and Glass trudge out, both profoundly disturbed as they head across the squad room
Glass veers off
Glass--
Reilly stares, eyes wet, watching him disappear
Glancing over, he notices Bev and
sitting with Meg down the hall, Tommy and Janie asleep in her lap
Schnoz walks up to Meg, whimpering
Bev wraps her arm around her

Harry answers it, holds it up urgently
It's him

Pluchinsky unlocks the cuffs
Mary's eyes flare 11/10/97        76
Get out and go to the machine shop - Mary steps out of the car
She glances around--then heads in the opposite direction of the Machine Shop
Pluchinsky curses
He starts to go after her, but realizes he'd better clear the area
He peals out

The passenger door flies open
Mary leans down and looks in, flushes
It's Swan
He reaches over and yanks her inside,  away
The Truck Driver runs into the other end of the alley

Reilly looks up sharply as he hears the , visible through the doorway
We're coming to you live near the scene of that latest, explosion that ripped through a downtown alley less than half an hour ago
Something clears behind Reilly' eyes
(impatient) Hey, asshole
Despite growing fears and talk of a coverup, police have sealed off the area and are refusing to comment about fatalities, or the rumor that terrorists may be involved
Reilly's eyes shift, mind racing
Hey, 'm talking to you-- Suddenly himself again, Reilly bolts up, sending the Dealer and his equipment scattering, and streaks off
He bursts out of the front door of the bar into the glare of sunlight
we can hear  not too far off

Empty
She dials zero

He releases it, we're done for
Swan turns back to Reilly, rams his Mac-11 to her throat
Drop it
(to Reilly) Take him
Mary jerks away from Swan
Reilly fast
Swan takes Reilly's  in the chest
He smiles as he starts to fall, his hand starts to open up to release the detonator
Mary dives onto Swan and grabs at the remote, clasping it in her hands
Swan collapses, Mary on top of him
11/10/97   90
Reilly and Glass sprint at the -Haul, reaching a trembling, bleeding Mary
She clinches her jaw, fighting the grief, holding on to the remote
Reilly reaches Mary first and puts his hands over her's - she looks up into his eyes--distraught
Hold on to that thing tight
Glass goes to the explosives and looks over the set-up
(cont
) Jesus Fucking
Christ
Reilly has never heard Glass swear before
Fuck factor
Off the scale
What do we do
Glass turns to Mary
Can you hold it
She nods
Reilly releases her gently, joining Glass at the van
Talk to me
Let's assess
Right
11/10/97   91
Glass stares at the digital read-out on the device anchored in one of the C4 crates
It reads: "1:30, 1:29
" 'mon, talk to me
We can do it
He has a timer going as back-up, in case we got a hold of the remote
(beat) Okay
first, run your fingers along the edges, feel for a sensor
Reilly does it the way he saw Glass do it before
Good, now the other side
Nothing
Okay, let's go in
1:18, 1:17, 1:16
Reilly feels around, finally finds an access hole
Reilly works the hole bigger
(cont
) Not enough time
gotta go for the blasting cap
Only one chance
hand entry
Keep talking
Close your eyes, feel your fingertips
Tell me everything you feel
11/10/97   92
Reilly' hand disappears into the hole
- - His fingers snake through complex circuitry as he describes each layer
Wires
metal, cold
something soft
Don't touch that
The red digital numbers keep counting down: 0:38, 0:37, 0:36 More metal
sharp edge
Stay to your left
Deeper, deeper
The  Van and a unit arrive, Winters and Benson jump out, the  Team is about to follow- Get outta here, Swan's down, but they're chilling a device
Winters looks to the action at the -Haul, sees Reilly and Glass busy at work
He nods at Benson
0:30, 0:29, 0:28
Finally Reilly' fingers touch a button object
We hear the Van and the unit retreat at the end of the alley
11/10/97   93
Something round, two wires
That's the blasting cap - good
Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up
No, Wait
What's wrong
Too easy
There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe
Make up your mind, trigger
0:19, 0:18, 0:17
Ease your thumb over to the right - feel anything
Reilly eyes shift as his hidden fingers feel around
Yeah, another round thing
Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down
Which one's which
don't know
What
11/10/97   94
When in doubt, pull the yellow wire
How the hell do you feel yellow
No excuses, just do it
10
Reilly glares at Glass
9
His face is dripping with sweat
8
His fingers shift back to the first cap
7
They close over it, ready to pull
6
But then they stop
5
Reilly frowns
4
Glass stabs him with a look
3
2
Lightning-quick, Reilly' fingers fly back and yank the second cap out of its base
The counter stops
0:01
Reilly and Glass and stare at it, holding their breath, hardly daring to believe it's true
They whoop and explode with relief
It's over
it's finally over
(cont
) Not bad, for a rookie
Thanks
Reilly and Glass turn to Mary who has lost consciousness but is still holding the remote tightly
11/10/97      95
Glass looks up to see
and Bev peeking from around their van
All clear, but we need an ambulance
Bev jumps into the van to make the call as
starts limping towards the -Haul
Schnoz yelps and drops from the van and runs for the -Haul
Reilly cradles Mary in his lap as Glass kneels and removes the remote - the red light stops flashing, then turns off
arrives and looks down at Reilly and Mary, then at the device in the -Haul
Nice work
: 100
-  -                           100 The room is back to its usual bustling activity
101
- '  -                     101 Winters is going through reports on his desk as Reilly enters
Reilly is cleaned up, shaven, haircut, new suit
a new man
Winters look up, impressed with the change
Mayor loves a hero
Winters hands Reilly an envelope and a new badge
(cont
) Just want you wanted
Your promotion, and transfer
11/10/97      96
Thank you, Captain
Winters nods and goes back to his paperwork
102
-                                              102 and Bev work closely together on a mock-device
is teaching her the job
They smile warmly at each other
Glass is on the computer
Reilly enters
Hey, you look great
flinches, but she winks at him to calm him down
smiles
no longer threatened
Glass doesn't look up from his computer
You're late
Glass points to the work station next to him where a Bomb Squad Protocol Program is waiting on the screen
Reilly smiles and he sits next to Glass, hands him the transfer papers envelope
(cont
) (softening) Welcome to the family
Glass accepts the papers and shakes Reilly's hand
Nice to be here
That feeling won't last long
11/10/97   97
, Glass and Bev start laughing
After a beat, Reilly joins in heartily
