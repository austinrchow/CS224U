"The Limey," production draft, by Lem Dobbs by draft 08/03/98 :
Wilson's first impression of Los Angeles was blue
He was in the sky at the time, so it was a curious reversal, looking down rather than up at the color he had always felt was nature's finest
Swimming pools
Hundreds of them
Pockmarking the landscape like miniature lakes
flat landscape of straight streets and square blocks and sparse grass that didn't look quite green enough
As far as Wilson could remember, he had only ever seen seven or eight swimming pools in his entire life and they had been public ones
Here everyone had their own
Marvellous
There was the one at the Butlin's holiday camp where he had enjoyed his last legitimate employment -- as driver of a tour bus
And there was the one at Crystal Palace he had gone to once or twice when he was younger
He was most familiar, though, with the Chelsea Baths as he had lived for some time in a flat nearby in what he now thought of as his good years -- before he'd gone grey, went to prison, and found himself in a plane over a foreign town arriving to avenge the death of his daughter
The sound of automatic doors opening and -- steps out into the late sunlight and the heat of the day
slow-motion moment while he gets acclimatized
He wouldn't have ever felt quite this kind of heat before
After such a rigorously air-conditioned interior
Or seen cops wearing guns on their belts
Or black cops, for that matter, with guns on their belts
Or seen people as fat as Americans on their home turf
Things someone from England notices immediately, whether consciously at first or not
Wilson's not here for comfort
Shown to a shitty room, round the corner of a typical 2nd-level outside walkway
Airport close by
He draws a curtain open across a window in one strong easy glide
His moves are neat
His expressions just as economical, not giving much away
Outside the planes are practically on top of us
The sunset colors strange and chemical
He's only got one light bag
Unzips, unpacks a few things
Change of clothes, a travel kit, and some familiar items (shaving foam/toothpaste/deodorant} bearing unfamiliar British brand names
Goes into the bathroom
Turns on the shower in there
Comes back to sit on the bed
Takes an envelope out of his jacket
Turns it over to see the return address on the back
Wilson in the back
Stares at the impenetrable name on the driver's posted
Glances at the driver
glances back at his quiet passenger in the rearview mirror
Wilson walks up a cracked little path to the front door
Lower middle-class street
Two cars in the driveway, one behind the other
Lights on inside the house -- as he rings the bell
Answers it
Hispanic
Late 30's
Chairman Mao on his - shirt notwithstanding, an easygoing sort of fellow
Not looking for any trouble -- anymore
But once did, and able to handle himself if any shows up
Which it has
Edward Rama
Eduardo
(rolling the ) Rama
You're home, then
He turns, waves away the taxi he's kept waiting
While Eduardo Rama waits for an introduction
My name's Wilson
Accent speaks for itself
Hard, working-class
Wilson
Knows the name
But just now it's unexpected
He's holding a hot  dinner, hand protected by a dish towel
You wrote to me about my daughter
'
Ed takes Wilson inside
didn't expect anyone
No reason
mean, what has it been -- six months
Round about, yeah
They've entered a cauldron of family life
blaring (
)
couple of younger  yelling "Mama"
Their  shouting back at them from the kitchen (in Spanish) that she only has two hands
sullen walking by
didn't even know who  was writing to -- just someone with the same last name
She never talked about any family
It was better than a telegram
Ed opens a screen door to the backyard
'
They sit at an outdoor table
Wilson with a  dinner in front of him now too
Sounds from inside
Even this little house has a little pool
Who done it, then
Huh
Snuffed her
Ed surprised at Wilson's directness
Ed stands nervously
Now, wait up a second, man
And paces back and forth
never said nothin' about nothin' like that
No, no, no
That's not what wrote to you
No, but between the lines, eh
Mysterious circumstances, and that
Ed stops pacing
Look,  sent you that newspaper clipping, all right
told you what  know
It was an accident
didn't say anything about anybody being "snuffed
" Beat
This bloke she was bunked up with
This Terry what'sit
Terry Valentine
Valentine
What's he got to say for himself
dunno
What's he gonna say
They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset
don't even know the guy
Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles
She had her life,  had mine
Makes a kind of scoffing gesture:  and you can see what my life is
Valentine came into the restaurant where work with Jenny a couple times
He's a money guy
Jenny would say, hey, here's my friend Eddie and he would shake my hand and everything, but he wouldn't even see me, you know what  mean
Wilson gazes up at the sky
Clear night
Stars
How long had she been in the States
(as if to himself, somewhat wistful) Near on ten years, wasn't it
Long enough to know her way about,  reckon
Ed leans down, palms on the tabletop, facing Wilson
There was an investigation, okay
The car was totalled
Jennifer was
Her neck was broken
On impact, they said
So she wouldn't have
felt the effects of the fire
(helpless shrug) It happens up there
Happens a lot
What more can  tell you
Wilson taps out a cigarette from a pack of "Silk Cut" he's produced from his pocket
What more is there
'm just sayin' -- it was a steep hillside
There was no moon that night
Wilson's quiet stillness is getting to him
Coulda happened to anyone, man
never knew her to be reckless
mean, sure, she would smoke a little grass, or something, have a few drinks
But that's it, nothing more than that
No, not my girl
Self-control, she had
Point of pride
(smokes) And people don't change, do they
dunno
Maybe they do
Wilson notes the tattoos on Ed's forearms
Going straight, are ya
Ed looks at him
Sits down again
Keeping his forearms under the table
(looks away) Boomerang
'what
knew when  was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face
(looks at Wilson again) did my time, okay
My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years
(re the family inside) This ain't your lot
You kiddin', man
don't need a wife and screamin' kids
still got my youth
And yet -- he lives here
Wilson declines to pursue the matter
go to work, try to keep my life together, put all that shit behind me, man
What d'you want from me
(calmly smoking) only asked
Ed sighs
Reaches for one of Wilson's cigarettes
Couple weeks before she died, Jennifer asked me to drive her downtown
Said she was meeting -- her boyfriend -- Valentine
But  think she was looking for him
: In a car, downtown
She has the same steely intensity as her father
Ed looks a little worried
(lighting Ed's cigarette) What, tryin' to catch him with another bird
That's what  thought, man
But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to
It was someplace else
Where abouts
: Talking to a beefy
Or talking at him
Either way, he isn't happy
Watch instead of working
Taking all this in
Bad place, man
Bad people
Some guys loading some trucks
Some kinda deal goin' down
(anticipating Wilson's next question) don't know and  don't care
Maybe they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos
Did Jenny know
(shrugs) Valentine wasn't even there
If he was into something, if she was involved -- who can say
(stands up again) But 'll tell you something
She stood in front of these dudes, man
Eyeballing them Checking them out
(beat) felt like she was covering my ass that day
Unconsciously rubbing his arms where his tattoos are
drove her back to Valentine's house
: Standing in front of his house
His expression says: We have something to discuss
He was standing outside waiting for her
That's the only other time  ever saw him
(a short sad note) Last time  saw her
He meets Wilson's gaze
As hard and pointed as a drill through his skull
'
Ed drives Wilson back to his motel
Wilson silent
Ed still not quite sure who he's dealing with
Is this really or merely a grieving dad
What you gonna do, man
You gonna go to the cops
Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they
Those streets up in the hills, man
Gotta be real careful, keep your eye on the ball
Two o'clock in the morning, it's dark, your mind is all agitated, you're drivin' a little too fast
(beat) Those curves don't kid around
Could be talking about the girl
Wilson doesn't move
But touch him, he'll explode
Out the window lights are passing, but no landmarks
He might as well be on the moon
You should talk to Elaine
That was her best friend
She didn't write to me, did she
She didn't know what to say
(shrugs) thought someone should say something
To someone
With me it was,  don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason felt like  owed her
Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever
(self-conscious again) Not me, man
'm no drug dealer, what you think
(re Ed's tattoos) think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service
already told you, man
Corcoran
Know what that is
State prison
Nick's a nick, n' it
No matter what state you're in
State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught
But that's not me anymore
That's when was into the gang lifestyle
That's not who  am now
Five years in the joint -- that's it for me, man
Now Wilson drops the clanger
Just got out meself, didn't
And Ed turns
Looks at Wilson
Fellow ex-con
'
Wilson out of the car, shuts the passenger door
Ed on the other side, looks over the roof at him
Go home, man
(plane taking off in background) Get on a plane
Wilson has other plans
'll be needing a shooter
Makes his fingers like a gun
And a clicking sound
(comes quickly over) You're kiddin' me, right
What do  do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages
(an urgent whisper) These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man
(looking around) Thought perhaps there'd be dispensing machines, you know
Bung in your coins, come out with a
44 Magnum, fully-loaded
Ed throws up his hands, walks back to his driver's side door
Are you a resident of California
You gonna fill out forms, man
Do the background check
Go through a three-day waiting period
Sod that
Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where 've skived off to
Probation
Man, you crazy
They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison
Travelling on a dodgy passport, n' all
Walks round to come face to face with Ed once more
Which is why  thought, save some time, get what  need under the table, like
As if resigned and mulling the problem over: Under the table
Hundreds of tables
Under bright lights
Displaying every kind of firearm
Handguns, rifles, shotguns, parts to make machine guns
weapons bazaar
Walking around
Even a cool customer like Wilson can't help but be impressed by America's loving embrace of senseless mayhem
Touting their wares
Trying out pistol grips -- or pushing baby carriages
Guys in fatigue jackets with toddlers on their shoulders
Women in stretch pants looking for a little something in personal protection
Doesn't know where to look
At the booth featuring "Classic Cowboy Collectibles" -- or the most   he's ever seen who just walked by
Attention:  the long-range vermin- shooting panel is due to commence in two minutes in the blue room at the rear of the Convention Center
and other anomalous oddball  in the background as long as we're here
At a booth selling laser attachments
BeamSight  is easily mountable on any shotgun, rifle, or sidearm and will project a small, bright red dot directly onto the point where your weapon is aimed
For purposes of display, a smiling   is the "target
" Walking past, almost subliminally noting the Young Woman with the symbol of death on her
45 passed from a 's hand to Wilson's
Man knows what he likes
(he'll talk if Wilson won't) Lookin' good
(while Wilson checks) That's a high-end item
Total reliability
What'd you call that -- the Protector
Yes, sir
Won't find a better  on the market
Wilson's eyes glance up -- but Ed asks the question
what
Close Quarters Combat
Keep one in my own home
Trouble is, 'm not at home, see
Fancied a bit of target shooting, y'know, while 'm here -- with me mate
Nods at Ed
Oh really
Where you from
England
(sighting the weapon) Only, we saw there was a show on, thought might pick something up for a price, type of thing
You came to the right place, sir
My wife's second cousin is English
Well, Scotch-Irish
Can  interest you in a holster
Just luck, this, really
Never been to one of these before
You're in gun country now, my friend
(picks up another, checks it out) Been to the Boat Show
(re Wilson's new selection) Packs a punch, but it's compact, has accessible features -- makes a nice concealed-carry piece
(playing the reluctant buyer) He don't have a concealed weapons permit
Don't have time for a lot of paperwork, y'know
Just popped over on a quick visit
can take care of the paperwork
Yeah
No problem
If you don't have a problem with me reporting this gun stolen
look of understanding between them
No
Not at all
(to Ed) Do we
Not me, man
mean, it's already a steal, n'it -- what you said -- four hundred for this one
Well, 'll have to add another two hundred on top of that
Oh, aye
(another look) for the paperwork
'
Ed drives
Nervous at Wilson handling his new gun purchase beside him
Violation of my parole, this
(a perfect pause) -- Goin' abroad
Ed shakes his head at Wilson's sense of humor
You hadda show up on a weekend
This weekend
Wouldn't've even been a gun show
for another month
Fucking out of order, that
Shouldn't be allowed
As he puts away a box of ammo
Now what
You gonna take your new arsenal, go visit Terry Valentine, just like that
Boom bam boom
It's only insurance
Can't be too careful
This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella
They were together how long
Five years,  think
Long time
Well, there you are
Jen must've liked him
Doesn't make Ed feel any better
Nor does the way Wilson seems now to be studying Ed's driving techniques
Paying attention to the way traffic lights and left-turn lanes and cars without clutches work over here
(remembering) Jenny told me she met him at the beach
Got blinded by his smile
(beat) You believe that shit
Son of a bitch never smiled at me
Buried her at a "private" service
Private for who
Him
(confused) Hang about
thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where  work
That's not where they met
And that's where you met Jenny
No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress
Before she met him
But that's not where she met me
Not in my restaurant
How'd the two of you hook up, then
Oh, Jenny was in my acting class
Wilson at the wheel himself
Getting the hang of
Driving downtown
Along one of the major boulevards
Glances at a street sign as he goes by
Picks up the map book on the seat beside him to check his route
Wilson makes a sudden lane change to avoid getting fed in the wrong direction
Gets  by another driver
Wilson cruises past a particular building
We don't have to really clearly see it just yet (we saw it in the flash cuts) -- more important we see him seeing it
Casing it with the eyes of a professional
Sniffing it out; the instinct of a predator after prey
Parks it
Produces the little leather travel kit we saw him unpack at his motel
Unzips it
Under the usual assortment of clippers, razors, etc
, is a hidden layer -- storing still more personalized items:  a set of select slim lockpicking/cutting tools
Wilson locks the car
Walks away
with him
He walks down the block
nice long walk
What we get out of it besides a sense of Wilson -- cool cat; ambling along; loner; sun beating down; not bothered; his shadow doubling him -- is this: The building approaching
The one he has his eye on
The target
It's across the street
kind of flat windowless warehouse with adjoining loading yard
Loading yard surrounded by a chain-link fence -- topped with barbed wire
The actual geography of where he left his car in relation to this building
Safely around the corner
And how he might practically get back to it, either this same way or via a more circuitous route round another block
The sense you get in downtown
on a lazy Saturday afternoon that you're in a ghost town
Particularly in this shabby kind of industrial section
Wilson crosses over to it now
From sunny to shade
Walks past the chain-link fence
The padlocked gate, big enough to accommodate the (couple of) trucks parked within the compound
Walks past the closed security door which would appear to be the building's main entrance
Round the next corner --  there's a steel back door as well
Comes around this block again
Looking surreptitiously around now
Streets here utterly deserted
Not even a passing car
Crappy residential building on an opposite corner, blaring from one of the open windows, but not with a direct view on the loading yard fence on this side
Wilson nearing it now -- taking something out of his pocket
One of the mysterious metallic tools from his travel kit
Snaps his wrist, unfolding the tool with a
Wire cutters
He doesn't go for the gate, the padlock, like we might have thought
He suddenly drops to one knee, in shadow where the fence meets the adjoining building
, , , , -- so quick, with great dexterity, though his face grimaces with the strength he has to exert with each application of pressure -- he cuts just as many links as he knows he needs to push in a little flap of fence and roll under
Whole thing accomplished in seconds
Walks fast to the cover of the trucks
Passes
Looks around
Cement loading docks and bays
Shuttered doors
He jumps up to one, puts his ear to the metal
Listens awhile
Scans the wall for any sign of an alarm box or anything
Then cocks an ear upwards
to show us what he hears:  an air-conditioning unit  away
Which means someone must be inside
Wilson looks back at his entry options
Not the loading doors -- but a conventional door at one end, with a conventional lock his eye zeroes in on
Gets out his tools, going over
at the door
It opens
He's in
Waits
Cautious
Nothing
He starts along the hallway
(the one from the flash cuts) does a double take as Wilson passes
Hey
Wilson stops and turns
Says nothing
How'd you get in here
Walked
You walked
(coming over) What the hell are you doing here
Looking for a bloke named Valentine
Know him
(who we saw before as well) who work here gathering
The Supervisor and the Meat Puppets exchange glances
He's expecting you
(beat) doubt it
The Supervisor moves toward Wilson
So why would he want to see you
have a message for him
About Jennifer Wilson
Jennifer Wilson
More looks are exchanged
You know her
Yeah
know her, all right
She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm
We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule
If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman  would've broke her jaw
'Course, she's nobody's problem now
Wilson stares at him
Is Valentine here
What do you think
Wilson looks at the Meat Puppets, the loading area
Where is he, then
Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt
Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions
Wilson just looks at him
Do you hear me, asshole
The Supervisor shoves him
The Meat Puppets move a little in anticipation
Wilson isn't giving any indication that he's going to leave
Jesus, you really want your ass kicked, don't you
He pushes Wilson again, hard
Go on, get outta here
He pushes Wilson again
Still, Wilson won't leave
Fuckin' nut
Go on
This time he tries to slap Wilson
Wilson blocks the Supervisor's hand and then punches him, hard
The Supervisor stumbles back and falls to the floor
Move to Wilson
He tries to fend them off, but there are too many
They beat him
When they find that he's armed, they beat him harder
Wilson is taken outside and dumped
After a moment, he gets to his feet
Dusting himself
Reaches for   tucked in his lower back
He re-enters the building
beat
We hear several
Seconds later, one of the Meat Puppets comes stumbling out of the door, terrified
He runs past us, fast
moment later, Wilson emerges, gun in hand
You tell him
You tell him 'm coming
/
'
series of images that prove Valentine (whoever he is) has taste, wealth, and influence, stretching back a good three decades at least
Walking through some of these shots is a young beauty in a bathing suit named
She advances slowly, not entirely sure of herself, and stops to look at things just like we do
At one point she looks to see a   () sitting at the kitchen counter, flipping through a magazine
He looks her up and down, more from reflex than anything
She continues on
Eventually she emerges through sliding glass doors and on to a patio
figure by the pool, talking on the phone
His back to us
The pool is spectacular, mosaic tile bottomed
Approaches, then sits beside him
His voice is soothing, but with the tiniest hint of exasperation that comes with being slightly ahead of everyone
(into phone) Not before
Not before Think about it
What does it mean
What -- no, 'm not
Think
Yes
See
You figured it out all by yourself
know
Are we done
Okay
He hangs up, stands, still doesn't turn
Adhara
told your father, if you're looking for a name, you can't go wrong with a constellation
used to hate it
Now  like it
Could be worse, he could've named you Reticulum
He turns and we see him for the first time
Polished
Handsome
Charismatic
Especially when he's smiling like he is now
He leans over and kisses her
Is there anything in the world that you want or need
want to know why you need that scary guy in your house
Gordon
He's been with me for years
He's not as tough as he looks
Then what good is he
Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty
Is that a problem
Not for you, clearly
'm loyal to things that make me happy
Am  a thing
Well, you're certainly not a person
'm not
No
You're not specific enough to be a person
You're more like a vibe
'm so glad we're having this chat
It's not a knock
It's not a compliment
It's an observation
Like:  'm hungry
When are we eating
As soon as you get dressed
What kind of food
Anything but Japanese
Why
'm not into finger foods
Too fussy
Like you
don't like do-it-yourself cuisine
Buffets
Salad bars
You demand to be served
fork fetishist
It's just fuel to me
'm not there for distractions
For some, eating is a sensual experience
The sensual experience
That's what Gordon's always saying
Oh, god
His cell phone rings
(into phone) Yes
He listens, then looks up at his balcony, where a  () stands holding a phone, obviously talking to Valentine
(into phone) 'll be there as soon as  can
He hangs up
(cont'd) We can leave as soon as you're ready
Okay
Valentine approaches Avery
What
There's been some trouble downtown
What kind
What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying
" Our black friends
No, Terry
They don't work like that
Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message
thought he was in prison, in England
Well, either they have a very liberal work-release program, or he's out, because he's here in
, looking for you
Valentine is a little ruffled
Maybe Avery likes that
What do we do
Beat
We wait, and we watch
Valentine just looks at him
'
Adhara approaches Valentine, who stands staring at the pool
Italian
'm sorry
Italian
Who
Not who, food
Should we get Italian
Sure
Turns to her
(cont'd) Yes
Are you ready
As long as  don't have to pass Gordon again
'm never ready for that
He smiles, rises, and offers her his hand
No
know another way out
She takes it
on her way in
Handsome woman
Intelligent, capable- looking
Passes Wilson who's leaning somewhere smoking
Aware as a wary woman will be of a strange man's presence without necessarily having looked at him
Well aware too that he stayed where he was -- so she unworriedly unlocks the building's security gate and goes through to the inner -- -- and closes the gate behind her, now seeing him amble up, arriving as it  shut between them
He's looking at her a certain way
She looks back
And knows
You're Jenny's father
And the recognition on his part: Had a feeling it was you
You look alike
(cigarette in hand) Perhaps it was the smoke
Not her brand
She used to pinch 'em off me
(trying to defuse Elaine's cold stare) Funny that
One thing she never tried to get me to stop
Elaine doesn't soften
Why did you come here
Wanted to talk to you, didn't
No, why did you come here
America
Sort a few things out
Been busy, have you
How d'you mean
It's been a while
was skint -- didn't have no money to get here
That's not what  heard
What was that, then
heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase
-- "at Her Majesty's pleasure
" It was the bars, then
Indicating his face, viewed by Elaine through the barred security gate that divides them
In any case,  don't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel
Sewing mailbags
Me
Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear
Wasn't about to start when  was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out
From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it
Pink Floyd concert receipts
Jenny would've been
fourteen at the time
(trying to conceal his surprise) Hardly buried
Earning interest, love
Earning interest in an offshore account
Tidy little premium per annum, that
Well, that kind of security can't be bought
Must be more comforting than a daughter to greet you
She turns to walk away
Here, aren't you gonna let me in
(without looking back) Try calling me again
'
She comes in
modest studio apartment
Puts her bag on the kitchenette countertop
Glances at her answer machine to see if she has any messages
The phone
She sits down glumly on her couch, holds her head in her hands
'
Wilson gives up, starts to walk away
The gate
'
Elaine opens the door
Wilson in the hall
was just going to toss some vegetable rolls in the microwave, open a can of diet soda
(beat) Want to take me out
Wilson and Elaine at a table
No,  went in for more improving pastimes
Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark
Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses
Sounds like Beverly Hills
Here, are you always this sarky
Sarcastic, moi
Maybe 'll mellow when my ship comes in
It's expected any day now
'm all packed and ready to go
Weren't you on a television series
(has he seen it
) If it played in England somebody owes me money
Who told you that -- Eddie
(yes) Said it went on for donkey's years
Three seasons
They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail
(blinks coquettishly) was wife number three -- the ingenue
Oh, it just ended, then
Now who's being sarcastic
When you've lost as many years as  have, love, puts things in perspective, know what  mean
'm sorry
guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went
(raises her drink) It must've been the bars
Their food arrives
It's a kind of prison, doing a series
Early to bed, early to rise, no time off for good behavior, you grab the boodle for as long as it lasts
(the kicker) Only difference is you can't get arrested afterwards
Wilson appears fascinated by the cold glasses of water on the table
Ice cubes  as he holds his bringing them to other people, too, just like that, without anyone even asking
can't believe Jenny told you all that
About me
She was always so embarrassed
Not embarrassed
(correcting) Ashamed
Not ashamed
Wilson looks at her
Okay
What then
Disappointed
She never told Eddie, though
She never told anyone else
(making light now) About the convict strain -- or is it stain
No,  was privileged
was someone who helped Jenny efface her past
How'd you manage that, then
When 'm not honing my craft in episodic television  do double-duty as a voice coach
Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress
Not with that look
Yeah, well, she started all that in London
Modelling
Learnin' 'ow to speak proper
(putting it on a bit there
Then, upper crust:) Central School of Speech and Drama
It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know
At seventeen
They offered her a place at  n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny
She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper
(indicating himself) Show up the old man, you know
Elaine smiles slightly
None of this information new to her
But warming to this man
You weren't disappointed in her, then
In Jenny
'Course not
How could  be
'Course  wasn't
She was twenty-one when she came to me
(looks at him) Straight from leaving you
Footloose and fancy free
She was happy here
However the two of you might have parted
Don't think she wasn't
It's because Wilson thinks the opposite that he's here
Looks at Elaine
That's the trouble, n' it
(hard as nails again) She enjoyed life
They walk along the seafront
We  the ocean but can't see it
When did you get in
Yesterday
Afternoon
(occurs to her) You haven't been lurking outside my building all day
No,  had -- some other matters to attend to, you know
Getting a car sorted
might've been away for the weekend
Well,  reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first
And you've seen Eddie Rama
Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah
Me and him are muckers
Mates
Friends
Makes a kind of bonding gesture
should really give him a call
He's a character, isn't he
Well, not to you
meant to us squares in the outside world
He give me your address
gave him yours
Said, here, you want to write,  think this is a relative guess  thought  was being true to Jenny
Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why
Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life
On her own after her mum died
Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned
Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother,  mean
Nah, we split up when Jenny was six
Her second husband done a runner after she got sick
They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital
We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum
like to think they're together again now
'know
Heavenly choir
Beat
The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a prison, was it
Nah, accommodation address
What's that, like a
box
Something like that, yeah
Where you get your bank statements
Wilson gives a laugh
Well, you gotta have something permanent, don'tcha
Even if it's a hole in the wall
No matter which jug  might be transferred to,  always got someone on the out checks up on it for me, see
Anything  need to know, comes round on visitor's day -- word in my ear
Elaine pauses
Some word
Wilson leans on the wall overlooking the black ocean
Sound of  gently lapping the beach
already knew
Knew beforehand
When was it supposed to have happened
-- two o'clock in the morning, Eddie said
(watching him) That's what was estimated
Eight hours difference between here and London
Would've been, what, ten in the morning, my time
was just coming out on the yard
Now,  was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then
Bit of fresh air, stretch me legs -- well, stretch the day out, really, that's what you wanna do
And 'll tell ya: couldn't open the paper
Could not pry the pages apart -- it was like they was glued together
That's how weak my hands went
Thought  was having heart attack, only  knew  wasn't
Bloke come up to me, he says, Dave, he says, you've gone all white
said, fuck me, 've been in prison half my life, what d'ya expect
But he was dead on, 'cause  could feel the blood drain right out of me head
And  knew
(beat) Something had happened to Jen
They stand here a while
Listening to the  hit the shore
'
They come in
Make yourself at home
Steal something
That gets her a look
There's nothing  can't afford to lose
She goes to make coffee
Wilson looks around
Do you even know who Terry Valentine is
Well,  gathered something from the article what Eddie sent me
Some sort of pop music producer, wasn't it
Maybe a smile from Elaine at the quaintness of "pop" music
Rock n' roll, is what we called it
He's sort of a forgotten figure now, but back when the West Coast was the grooviest place on earth, Terry Valentine was where all the happenings happened
More of a kind of promoter,  guess, whatever that means
Just took that whole Southern California Sixties Zeitgeist and ran with it
Packaged and sold it
Made out like a bandit
: At home
Watching as Adhara undresses, either deliberately for him, or just casually
She smiles as she notices he's looking
What's he done lately
That line pregnant with meaning
Elaine looks at him
Avoids answering the question actually implied there
(brings a tray over) Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing
Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure
Now, you shouldn't run yourself down
My employer, Mr
Lindgren -- -- Your employer
-- Mr
Lindgren
Who's Mr
Lindgren
My employer
What line is he in
Proprietor of a London firm
Of longstanding
see
Based in London, but with international concerns
bet
Various enterprises, style of thing
thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life
Well, not to say Mr
Lindgren is dishonest, exactly
(she gets the picture) Right
Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you
In what capacity are you employed by this Mr
Lindgren
This and that
'know
Ways and means
-- When he wants someone run down, you're willing to do it for him
They sort of come together -- in mutual understanding -- and sit down
Coffee steaming
So what's the deal
You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces
Is that what this is about
Why not
Are you serious
Have you ever known me not to be
Elaine looks away: You fuckin' guys and your dicks
What'd you want me to do
Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs
Doing sweet
[Fuck All]
You don't believe it was a car accident
What do you think
Terry's never going to give you satisfaction
Not the type
Depends, don' it
On what
What makes you so certain
'll bloody well ask him
There's the phone
You want his number
That look again
got his number
Past caring
'm not going to help you
She goes into a bathroom
Shutting the door behind her
Sips coffee
Bites into a cookie
Thickets part and we  Wilson scrambling up a rather steep hill
Coming to a ridge where he settles down to look at something
His expression changes by degrees from curiosity to dawning realization to a kind of frustrated disappointment
'  (   )
Ed sits in here,  on
Wilson appears out of the brush, gets in
Ed turns the radio down
(mindful of the odd car driving past) Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate
Gate's open
had a butcher's at the house
(alarmed) Who'd you butcher at the house
Butcher's hook
Look
(doesn't anyone speak English in this fucking country
) don't much reckon those minders of his
Huh
He's brought in the heavy mob
What
Extra muscle
Bodyguards
Has he
They look a right load of wallies
Patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the fuckin' Household Cavalry
(ducks suddenly) Watch it
As one of the "bodyguards" runs by, only fleetingly glimpsed by us
That was one of them
(sits up again) See what  mean
Wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all
Off Ed's perplexed look
Wilson settles into position again, this time with Ed
Look at that
Ed just laughs
What's so fucking funny
Those aren't guards
They're valets
Now we  what Wilson had mistaken for Valentine's private army
Half a dozen  outside Valentine's hilltop home
Dressed in matching attire, a couple of them wielding walkie- talkies
Ed's still laughing
Valets
What d'ya mean valets
What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster
Valets They park cars
He's having a party
'
Wilson's car pulls up
He and Ed get out
Wilson engages in a mini tug-of-war with a Valet over his car key, it so rubs him the wrong way having to give it up
Keep it handy, mate, all right
We're not stopping long
He gestures, apparently getting the message across that he wants the car kept close by
Yes, sir
Cheers
Exchanges the key for a card -- which he turns over in his hand and studies curiously as they head inside
Valets, eh
Aren't we all la-de-da
(nervous being here) thought you just wanted to check out the house, man
Well, that's what we're doin', n' it
No one else is even here yet
First in, first out, that's me
Looking over to note the multi-car  off the main house
'
Wilson and Ed are among the first to arrive
smattering of other
Elaborate catered cuisine
They mosey over to the wet bar
Gentlemen
What can  get you
(suggesting Ed take first crack) Dubonnet with a twist
Baby sham
Tomato juice and Tabasco sauce
By now his whole dynamic with Ed is a verbal tease
(to Bartender) Got a Coke
'
Valentine is checking himself in a full-length mirror
on in background, sound low (
)
Not quite satisfied, Valentine crosses to the bathroom
Valentine takes one more closer look
(
) You have the same posters
Valentine turns
Hmm
Is lounging in the large tub
Staring dreamily at a couple of framed posters on the walls:  more 60's psychedelia
That you have down at your office
Valentine sits on the edge of the tub
With a nostalgic air as he looks at her:  the embodiment of youth
Different ones
He strokes her wet skin
They kiss lightly
like the colors
We all did
It must've been a time
golden moment
Beat
Have you ever dreamed of a place
you don't really recall ever having been to
a place that probably doesn't even exist except in your imagination
somewhere far away, half-remembered when you wake up
but when you were there you spoke the language, you knew your way around
(significant pause) That was the 60's
With that exit line (practiced
), he starts to go
Then pauses, turns again
No, it wasn't
Wasn't either
Comes back to her
Faraway look in his eyes
It was '66
early '67
(comes back to now) That was all
He goes
'
Wilson wanders around, exploring the house
Comes to a wall of photographes
Casually scanning them as he passes slowly by, he's caught up short by one
framed photo of , his daughter
series of emotions play over his face
He turns -- Valentine coming down the stairs
Valentine joins the party without noticing him
Ed peruses the available food
Valentine comes over to check it out
Glances at Ed without recognizing him
Hi
And goes away
Leaving Ed more nervous than ever
'
Wilson has come up here
Peeks into one room
Moves along to another:  the master bedroom
Opens the door gently
Adhara is still enjoying her bath
Wilson enters
Careful
Aware that someone's in the adjoining bathroom
The soft  of  from in there
Perhaps he even glimpses her through the door as he boldly looks around
He notices a video camera on a tripod, a cord running to the television
Suddenly we hear the  of a cellular phone
Adhara reacts
Shit
She gets out of the tub and goes for the nearest towel
Quickly wrapping herself, she exits
Adhara enters and goes for her purse
She pulls the phone out and answers it
Hello
Hey
Great
You got my message
Yeah
No, Crestview Terrace, not Crestview Place
Yeah, there's like three different ways up the hill; the quick way is to bear to the right
Sure
Okay
Okay
'Bye
She hangs up and begins toweling her hair
After a moment she stops
Something isn't right
She looks around the room, and her eyes stop on the
Her brow furrows, trying to place the familiar image on the screen:  a girl towel- drying her hair by the bed
That's me
She looks over to see the video camera, which has been turned on and pointed toward the bed
She's not sure if it's funny or creepy
'
Valentine mingling, all smiles and movement
At the foot of the stairs
Watches him, all stillness and intensity
Catches Wilson's eye for a nanosecond, does a subtle double take, then moves on
'
Adhara, dressed, looking great, exits the bedroom and heads for the stairwell
'
Adhara descends the stairs
Turning to  her as she comes down
Makes her way across the room to Valentine
Hey,  thought you weren't a buffet person
'm a gracious host
Watching them, when -- Excuse me
Wilson looks at him
Reluctantly
Don't you work with Ian
Ian
could swear  met you with Ian at the offices in London
Sorry
Wasn't me
You sure
Unless 'm not who  think  am
That's too bad
Ian's got a good thing going over there
Yeah
Turned that place completely around
180 degrees
No kidding
What  like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what 'm saying
Right
Chain of respect
That's good, that
Yeah
really admire the guy
Well
Good to meet you
Yeah
Cheers, mate
The Guy leaves
Wilson sees that Adhara is now on the other side of the room, separated from Valentine
He heads for her
Still dealing with people desperate to be the focus of his attention
He notices: Talking in a corner
She seems attentive
In a   , still being the gracious host, still keeping his eyes on: Who, in a   , continue to talk
Finally, they separate, Wilson heading outside onto a deck
Excuses himself from a group of sycophants and goes to her
Valentine approaches and begins talking to her, low
After a few moments of conversation, they both look toward: On the deck outside
Joining Ed, who's taken refuge out here with a plate of food
What Wilson can't belleve when he it -- is that behind Valentine's house, which is on top of a high hill, is nothing but desolate scrub canyon
On the other side of the railing around the deck, which is surely less than regulation height, is a sheer drop into an abyss
(cont'd) (jumps back with only slightly affected vertigo) Flipping heck
Ed, a little more accustomed to
architecture, nods in agreement
If you could afford a house like this you would buy a house like this
Wilson edges forward to the rail again
What are we standing on
Faith
They stand there looking out
Quite a view once you get used to it
Breeze
(cont'd) (nods to the hazy distance) You could see the sea from here if you could see it
Could you
But now Ed gives Wilson a nudge --  that Valentine inside the house is making his way out here
Why don't you go nick one of those little cooker what's its warming up the sausages cocktail and meet me in the garage
Look about for a toolbox while you're at it
Ed considers
His is not to reason why
Okay
Ed moves off
Valentine steps up, smile fully loaded
Hi
Terry Valentine
He extends his hand
Wilson shakes it
Pleasure
Have we met
There's something  can't quite -- in London
work with Ian
Ah
You must know Ian
don't
Great bloke
Really turned things around there
180 degrees
suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were
Oh,  think a shake-up was in order
Definitely
Otherwise, people get lazy, don't they
Forgetful
Start thinking they can get away with things
Gotta shake 'em up now and again, make 'em pay attention
Wilson looks at him
Valentine looks back
Something about those eyes
Terry, Terry
The Excited Guy appears, tugging at Valentine
Glad  got to meet you
Ter
Ter
you gotta
Thanks
You, too
Be seein' you
The Excited Guy ushers Valentine away
Wilson watches him go
Charles Grodin is here
'
Ed, waiting
Wilson enters
Got it
Ed displays the Sterno
Toolbox
Ed points to a table, where a toolbox sits
Wilson crosses to it, begins going through the contents
Put the Sterno on the ground, near the center of the garage
Ed does
Wilson pulls a brace-and-bit from the toolbox and crosses to the rear of one of the cars
Dropping to the ground, he bores a hole in the gas tank
Ed raises his eyebrows and moves toward the door
Wilson crosses to the other car and puts a hole in that gas tank as well
Then he puts the brace-and-bit back in the toolbox and heads for the exit, Ed right behind him, giving a quick backward glance
Spills out, slowly but steadily, and slithers toward the garage door
'
Wilson and Ed walk briskly along the path
(gives Ed parking ticket) Bring the motor around
Bang out in front, right
You goin' back inside
One thing  need
'
Valentine is talking to Gordon, his beefy bodyguard, and looking around
He stops as he sees Wilson once again stepping onto the deck
He points Wilson out to Gordon, who nods and heads for the deck
'
Ed hands the ticket to a Valet
He exchanges looks with a couple of the other Valets
'
Valentine is talking to Adhara, who is introducing her Girlfriend
As Valentine greets her, he glances outside where Gordon is approaching Wilson on the deck
Wilson  Gordon approaching
Gets ready to greet him
Removes cigarette from mouth, drops it to floor of deck, presses it out under his shoe
Limbers up his shoulders in a subtle way
Gordon coming towards him
As if to challenge Wilson's legitimacy as an invited guest
Closer
About to speak
But Wilson doesn't even give him a chance to do that
In quick succession:  Wilson   Gordon, splintering his nose;  him in the groin; then, using the knee for leverage, grabs Gordon by the lapels -- and heaves him over the railing
It happened so fast that if anyone else is nearby they probably didn't even notice -- or didn't readily grasp what they saw
'
Valentine had turned his attention back to Adhara and her Girlfriend
When he glances back to the deck he's a little concerned not to see Gordon anywhere out there anymore -- just Wilson coming back in
Adjusting his jacket, walking back through the house
Behind him, people are rushing to the railing and looking over few yells of "Call an ambulance
" etc
are heard
Moves that way
Moving across the room towards the front door
They are heading right toward each other
Pass each other, eyes locked, almost dream-like
Wilson's eyes cold, though with the hint of a smile
Valentine throws a last look back before reaching the deck
Valentine pushes through to look over the railing
Gordon -- a crumpled, inert heap way down the hill below
Turns to look toward the front door
Wilson not to be seen
Valentine pushes through the crowd toward the door
'
Valentine emerges in time to see Ed and Wilson pulling away
Wilson looks at him, impassive, through the passenger window
Is just arriving in his car
Valentine gestures at him
Suddenly we  a loud, bass-heavy
Valentine (and a few others) turn toward the sound, which came from: There is smoke coming from under the door
Wilson's car practically tobogganing back down the hill
We hear an explosion from back  the hill
'
Ed jumps -- though he's driving
The gas pedal his most pressing concern
Negotiating the dangerously winding road comes second
Exhilaration mixed with panic
Steady on
You steady on, man
What the fuck else did you do back there
An especially sharp curve looms ahead
Flinches, grabs a handhold
Car makes it around on two side wheels
Gulps
Bloody hell
Ed regains control
In his car, takes a different turn
Swerves some more curves
Should be some sense here that a similar skyline route would have been taken by Wilson's daughter on her final drive
'
Why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance
That would be too easy
Too easy
He's gotta know why
You think a fuckin' guy like that ever will
What more do you want, man
Suddenly out of nowhere -- (a side street) --
-- another car shoots out to cut them off, sideswiping them
Wilson's car  into a spin from the impact
It's Avery
Chased them via a shortcut down the mountain
Now jumps out of his car, levels a shotgun at them and pumps off a
' -- the trunk pops open as the car rights itself
Avery again, but the upended trunk is a kind of shield, deflecting the shot
'
Despite the fact that Ed is still in the driver's seat (and managed rather skillfully to avoid crashing) -- Wilson acts like he's not there, grabs the steering wheel, jams the car into reverse, virtually sitting on Ed as he pounds his own foot onto the gas pedal -- and with his ferocious eyes monitoring the door-mirror, steamrolls the car backwards towards Avery
Wilson reverses his car like a speeding tank:   into Avery's car
Pushing it right off the edge of the road
Falls backwards to the ground as he gets the hell out of the way
Jumps out of his car
Gun drawn
Advancing on Avery with it pointed
' through underbrush down the steep bank of the hillside
' of the divebombing car
Another pointed echo of his daughter's fate
Their eyes meet momentarily
And before Wilson can shoot, Avery rolls over the edge of the road himself
Calls frantically to Wilson from their car
'mon, man
'mon
in the distance
That consuming rage overtaken him again for a second
But the exigencies of the moment snap him out of it
Turns on a dime, goes back to the car
Before he's halfway in, Ed's driving them away again
Trunk at the back up and down, up and down
Pulls himself back up to the road
Brushing himself off
Looking the way they went
He gently tosses his shotgun down into some thick brush where maybe he'll retrieve it later
'
Avery returns, sweating, walking back up the road to where all the action is
Party guests milling outside, waiting for their cars so they can leave
fire truck, a police car
pouring out of Valentine's garage
Valentine finishes talking to a couple of
Walks over to Avery
You should have let me do the talking
Why, because you're my security consultant
(insecure) This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down
(more concerned about police presence) What did you tell them
Valentine blows air, runs a hand through his hair
told them a long-time employee flipped out
Had a drug problem, refused counselling
Set the garage on fire, then committed suicide
One of my "guests" tried to stop him -- but how do you stop Gordon In this context meaning how did that rangy Englishman do it
mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds
Heavier than that now
But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story
As it happens
didn't make that part up
And where is this guest
Don't they want to interview him
don't know everyone here
He was so traumatized he split
(another notion) Maybe he was Gordon's pusher Avery stares at Valentine
Impressed at him thinking on his feet
Where do you think he is, Mike
(already turning) We'll find him
(stops him) No
mean
Not even your people should be involved
Right
It's too close now
You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here
You think 'm staying
There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons
Well, can we make it one more
Nowhere the fuck near me
He's being glib, but he's being serious
His open-handed gesture inquiring of Avery:  are you up to the task
have other resources
He turns to go
'
The huge dead bulk of Gordon hoisted back up to the deck by a paramedic team
'
Valentine comes back in
In the living room beyond, Adhara stands anxiously, where she's been waiting for him
Cops visible outside on the deck, peering over the edge
Heading that way
Then stops
Backtracks
Something peripherally had caught his eye and he returns to it
His wall of photographs
The one that had contained the picture of Jenny
'
Safely down the hill
Driving away in traffic, Ed calmer now
Pulls the rolled-up photograph of his daughter out of his jacket and looks at it
Two characters stand, leaning, against a back wall
Staring ahead, without purpose
Halfheartedly watching a game of pool in progress
Just hanging out
Strange, threatening characters
One of them is young
Lean, hungry-looking
is his name
shrewd, scheming kid
But definitely a little unhinged
Weirder is his companion
The title isn't one of courtesy
He's an actual blood relative
Maybe 25 years older than Stacy
But intellectually younger
Physically, much bigger
The man is huge
Nevertheless, the safer of the two -- until Stacy tells him otherwise
Way they're standing next to each other suggests the ease they feel in each other's company
Tight bond
They're good buddies
Walks in
Stops to look around
Spots his two freaks
Walks toward them
mysterious black man has followed Avery in
is his name
He hangs back and watches
Makes contact
Stacy
Stacy turns to see him
Uncle John looks vacantly
(bored) Hey
Come over here
That was in the way of an order
He nods around the corner where it's less crowded
Stacy stops Uncle John from following, and goes after Avery
At the bar
Keeping his eye on them
Speaks softly
Alone with Stacy
How they goin', kid
Not bad
How'd you like to kill someone for me
Okay
Avery gives him an envelope
Same as last time -- the rest after
(pockets it) Where do we go
When you find the guy, you'll know
What shit is this
just do it don't prepare it
'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone
He's a hit-and-run gunman -- figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge
This is un-fucking professional
See, a successful man like me has limitations --  lose touch at a street level
So  have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than  am
Fuck you, Mr
whatever-your-name is
This is a lifestyle  embrace
That's why 'm letting you take care of this
'm the one with appearances to maintain
But who gives a shit about you
Not even God
'
Wilson on the bed
Watching  (
) at door
He turns down the
Takes a
45 from the springs under the bed
Looks carefully through the peephole in the door
Opens it
Elaine has come to visit
Lets her in
After closing the door resumes his position on the bed
Elaine looks around
was in the neighborhood
come down here quite a bit
Watch the planes taking off
(re this motel) Study the architecture of early David Lynch
But she doesn't really have it in her to be ironic right now
Leans back against the door
Wilson remains silent
He's done the same to Elaine now that he did to Ed
Almost magically induced her to a confessional verge
Elaine, too, isn't sure she wants to be complicit in this revenge tragedy
But here goes: Jenny was supposed to come to my place that night
She called me, asked if she could come over
She and Terry had been -- having some trouble
Lately
don't know about what
On this occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point
She told you all about my details but not about his
Lovely
She'd never called me like that before
She sounded more
pissed off -- angry -- than upset or afraid
But she never turned up
called the house but only got the answer machine
When they found her
she'd been going the wrong way
Not the direction she'd have gone if she'd been coming to see me
Or coming straight to see me
Who knows
Maybe she just wanted to drive
She looks at Wilson
Shrugs
That's it
That's all
Isn't it
(measured) How did you come to have my address
Found it, did you
Among her things
You think Terry gave me access to her things
Probably sold her clothes
(gently urging) And how did you get it
Elaine looks at him
She gave me your address
Wilson nods
(cont'd) (starting to realize) Not long before
(realizing) She said if anything ever happened
(realizes) That's how you know
That's why you're so sure
(realization) Jenny's telling you
She's sitting on the bed now
Stacy, putting on a jacket that says "Bomb Hanoi" comes out of the pool hall
Uncle John in tow
How much
Five thousand
(impressed) Hey
(taps pocket) got half
Makin' trouble for someone
Yeah
Which kind
The forever kind
Thompson, the mysterious black man, watches them from the hall doorway
'
Early
'
Wilson and Elaine
Getting dressed
She's in pantyhose
Fastening a bra
He's got trousers on, reaching for a shirt
How long've you lived here
Elaine sits on the bed, fastening her skirt
Her bra strap cuts across her bare back
This town's been chewing my flesh since
what we now refer to as "the early 70's
" (thinks back) Christ, my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me
Early 70's
was away
(tries to remember) Maidstone
Possibly Brixton
These more highlights from the Zagat prison guide
Wilson looks at her:  she's the one who goes to bed with ex- cons
You don't seem bothered
You don't know how 've compromised my standards
Tell us about it
It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement
Anywhere else 'd be an interesting little number, here 'm just number forty-eight thousand and one
(quickly) meaning Screen Actor's Guild
Oh,  was gonna say
Still, there have been rewards
It's sunny
And some of the producers who call even have credits
can see the attraction
She glances up at him to try and see how he means that
Is he looking at her or out the window
What did you do
To make them take the early 70's away from you
jeweller's up the West End
We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road
Filthy work
Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- after we'd made the grab, 'n all
Would you Adam n' Eve it
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess
We were lucky to be nicked
Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday
Good job we were still breathing
It didn't discourage you, though
Hey
From pursuing your chosen profession
'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner
Put me right off any escape attempts
Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience
Not bloody likely
was inside once
punched a cop at a demo
Did you
What was that in aid of
Who remembers
Get seven years, did you
Overnight
What about just now
Just now
(playful, goes over, ready for more) Overnight
You have been away
(lies back, regards him carefully) Or is all this just new to you
It's true
Has to be said
got off to a slow start
don't believe it
Honest
Didn't know where to look till was 21
Pushing the legal limit even then
He stands again, vaguely disappointing her
Me mate introduced me to a woman up the street
Funnily enough, she was married to a milkman
Straight up
said, "Good is she
Been around
"  He said, Good Listen, mush, it's not that she's been around, it's that she's been around hell of a long time
" He laughs uproariously at that
But the point is:  he's sort of complimenting both Elaine and himself
They've been around, had their knocks, they've lasted
Elaine remains unsmiling
Still leaning back on her elbows on the bed, in bra, skirt, hose, no shoes
She asks again the question Wilson avoided answering
Your most recent incarceration
What was that for
And again he evades the answer she wants
It was for nine years
(buttoning his shirt) The last nine years
For the first time, we see the Pacific coastline
Impressive
And a sleek Italian sports car
Heading north
Valentine at the wheel
Adhara besides him
've lived in
all my life, 've never done this drive
All your life
That happened while swam the length of my pool
Adhara looks back over her shoulder
Checking the road behind
What's the matter
Nothing
guess it's hard to pass on this road
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time
sure hope so
big utility vehicle
With Avery in the front passenger seat
And three bodyguards he's brought along to protect Valentine
driving,  and  in the back
All 'm sayin' is travel time shouldn't be the same rate
Travel time is down time, right
mean, we're not even in the same car as the client
(to Avery) You told me the job was at the house
When we get to it
Well, are we shadowing the client right now or are we just going the same way
The company  was with in Seattle, these distinctions were made
Now,  don't dispute him getting the full whack
(he means Rick, who's older) Seniority and all that
But if 'm getting paid the same hourly rate when we're at the house as  am in this car, that doesn't sit well with me and  feel obliged to say so
'Cause in Seattle what you're paying now for so-called travel time was half what we got for actual clock-time with the client
So just feel we should get more when the job actually commences After this spineless whining weak-willed sob story, Larry just turns to him and says: 'd really like to eat your pussy
'
Stacy and Uncle John sitting on a bench in a beach setting (though we still don't see the ocean)
Or on some grass, maybe, in a little park -- opposite Elaine's building
People-watching
In their own unique way
Stacy commenting on fellow humanity all around them
between each comment: (after laughing loudly at a handicapped person) believe in mocking the afflicted
Good for 'em
Makes 'em stronger
Uncle John picks at the grass or sand
As they kill the day
(spotting a woman with a dog) Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores
Wow
(as a fat jogger passes) Good luck
(watching someone else go by) Jesus, are you gay enough or what
(barely out of earshot of a black woman with dyed blonde hair) Very attractive
Good idea
Now really want to fuck you
(after a long time in silence, just staring at someone) you can always tell the ones who'll do anal
(regarding some other beachgoers) Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it
(reading a newspaper) Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth
(leaning back on his elbows) Why don't they have  shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching
'know
Like Or
Wouldn't that be good
(sitting up) Two blacks and a Mexican in a car
Who's driving
don't know
The
(observing a "fast-walker") Oh yeah, keep doing that
That's really healthy
(his gaze following another unfortunate) Can't you do something about your ass
(his head turning after someone else) Other people's lives scare the shit out of me
(watching some guy rooting in a trash bin) "Homeless" people
Fuck them
Remember when they were just bums
Everyone with an axe to grind
Like to grind in their face
Pretty soon there'll be shit-in- your-pants rights groups
Stupidity activists
(glad he's who he is and not who he's looking at) Wonder what it's like being a dumb guy in a dumb suit trying to cross the street
(staring at another sad couple) Life sure is a minefield
(clocking another female) Look at that one
She's really been used
(in a contemplative mode) 'd love to be famous so  could snub ordinary people
Imagine, you're famous, you're sitting in a restaurant, some fool comes up to you, wants you to sign your name on his napkin, his wife is there, it would be something these poor saps would cherish the rest of their lives, talk about to their cretin friends
Bam
You tell 'em to
God, 'd love that
Suddenly Uncle John speaks
Is that her
bet that's her
Stacy turns
Across the street, Elaine comes out of her building
(We're supposing this is an apartment building somewhat worth living in that has outdoor parking of some kind, visible from the street, or only street parking
) Elaine's car on the move
Stacy and Uncle John in a car following
'
Going somewhere
Unaware of the creeps in her wake
/ '
An "8x10" of Elaine on their back seat
Another picture of her on a page torn from a "Player's Directory
" Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy
(driving) Avery said she was tight with his daughter
That don't mean nothin'
Stacy knows better than to argue with a moron
She's nice lookin'
So what
dunno
just said she's nice lookin'
And  said so what
You think she's any happier
What d'you mean, any happier
Any happier than any other asshole in life
Pause
dunno
never met her
On screen:     -- but speaking in ' At a mic
Wearing headphones
Matching her voice to the model's lip movements
Looping this commercial or whatever it is
Wilson
Comes to a window where he can see Elaine inside in the sound-proofed studio
Wilson and Elaine talk while technicians change reels
-- they want Southern,  do Southern, they want Midwest,  do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, 'm shit out of luck
(pauses) One thing  can't do is English
Americans can't
Shouldn't even try
And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us
You ever been to London
Only in the movies
've 'ardly ever left it
Yeah, well, you're here now -- (re Wilson's accent) -- where urricanes ardly ever appen
've got the hang of the driving
Found this place all right
Stick with me, kid
Looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes
Beat
(cont'd) So, is there anybody in your family who's not a criminal
Not that  recall
What about your grandmother
Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop
Crafty old sod
He alive to see this
(shakes head) Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill
Watching Doris Day
What'd your father do
Black market during the war
Elaine shakes her head
guess you're just habitual
You sound like my fucking probation officer
Won't he be looking for you about now
Good luck to him
He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear -fronts
Minor officials bother you, don't they
Do us a favor
Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for
'
Elaine and Wilson enter
Stacy not far behind
Catches outside gate before it slams shut
'
Wilson and Elaine turn the corner into the corridor approaching her apartment door
Pause to kiss
Walk closer
And Stacy appears at the other end of the hall
Both arms stretched out with the
38 at the end of them
Hi, kids
Starts to squeeze off a shot
As Wilson pushes Elaine to the floor
As another rings out from further along the hall behind Stacy
Catching him across the cheek
Only skimming him
But knocking him down
Bullet chipping the wall
Across from Stacy
Freezes, his own gun in hand
Three
Including Thompson
They approach
Guns pointed at Stacy and Uncle John
Hand on his
45 now
But a fourth Black Guy coming up behind him
Wilson lowers the
45
Flattened herself back against a wall
Petrified
Sits on the floor
Holds his hurt face
Thompson walks over and picks up Stacy's gun
One of the other blacks relieves a reluctant Uncle John of his
(stops at Wilson) Come with us
If there's any doubt whether Wilson will -- one of the blacks gently puts the muzzle of a gun to Elaine's head
Cocks the hammer
They all go off down the stairwell
Except Stacy and Uncle John
Hit men wondering what hit them
Like Wilson's motel room, another version of a cell
small window, high up
Bricks and debris around the floor
And Wilson and Elaine
Sitting, leaning against opposite stone walls
Tell me you wouldn't prefer a steady income
Wilson takes a cigarette pack from a pocket
Lights himself one
Then tosses the stuff over to Elaine
got a steady income -- 'm on the dole
(lights up) leech on the welfare state in addition
You don't miss a trick
fiddle it
They got me down as an immigrant with five kids
Elaine sort of shares a laugh at that
Yeah
Jenny spoke fondly of her imaginary siblings
Though real ones might have been nice
This an unspoken thought between them
(cont'd) Do you remember the last time you saw her
Last time might as well've been the first
remember all the times, don't Watching her grow up -- (finding the word) in increments
She told me you were a ghost in her life
Daddy the friendly ghost
Coming back to haunt her
Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of Still, you could never
do what she wanted
Wilson shakes his head
She used to tell me she'd turn me in
(tries to laugh about it) Little kid
Ten year old
"If you're naughty, Dad, 'll tell on ya
"  She didn't want me sent down again, see
When  was planning some job
"'ll tell 'em, Dad,  promise  will
Here, look, 'm calling the Old Bill right now" -- picking up the telephone
can see her, the phone in her hand
Became a sort of joke between us
Only it wasn't a joke
She never would have turned you in, not in a million years
know that
But as time went on
well, it wasn't a joke, was it
She had a feeling about it -- about the last job -- how long 'd get the hook for
Said she wouldn't be there this time when got out
opens
Thompson
Gun in hand
Thompson leads Wilson past a row of windows
Dockyards, harbor activity outside
Toward a door with things stencilled on it
One of them:
man named
Black
Half sitting on the edge of a table
Wilson is shown in
Wilson at the door
Sizes Feather up at a glance
This is where  come in
He walks confidently in
Outside, through the window, an image of a foreign sports car being hoisted in the air by a crane
There's a chair
Wilson sits in it
Feather squints a little
Seems ready to listen to whatever Wilson has to say
(cont'd) How's it going, squire, all right
Now listen -- when  was in the nick -- second time, it was -- no, third
Third stretch, yeah
There was this screw had it in for me
That geezer was top of my list
Two years after  was slung,  saw him
He was sitting on a bench in Holland Park
There was no one else about
coulda gone up behind him and snapped his fucking neck
But  left it
Coulda nobbled him, but  didn't
'Cos what  thought  wanted wasn't what wanted
What  thought  was thinking about was something else
This berk on the bench wasn't worth my time
See what mean
It didn't matter
It meant sod all in the end
Feather has been listening to this, expressionless
Now he raises a finger as if there's a point he wants clarified
There's one thing  don't understand
(wants to make this clear) The thing  don't understand
is every motherfucking thing you're saying
Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, can see that, 'm on your manor now, right
So there's no need to get out of your pram
'm Johnny-come-lately to all this
Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me
don't wanna know
Well, 'll tell you
believe this Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money
can well believe it
'm sure he has done, son
He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg
But  can't be sure
don't even know who he is
He's too insulated
Too many layers around him
Your guess is as good as mine, mate
'm here on another matter entirely
(moves to window) Yeah,  guess you are
Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been me for the high jump
That dude who works for Valentine
He's the one sent those guys after you
You know that
Yeah
Shouldn't wonder
Must've done
So what's your beef, pal
Nothing financial
Strictly personal
(moves to window) can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where 'm concerned
foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like
(looks at him) It was you
Downtown
(all innocent) Eh
Because that wasn't anything to do with me
And suspicion has been cast in my direction
(pondering) Didn't make any sense
Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too
No,  can reassure you on that point
Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you
He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut
Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it
All of what
Of the deal, man
Oh, yeah, right
The deal
But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you
that must make us pals
As you prefer, squire
As you prefer
(weary of his life) In which case 'll just do what  usually do
And that is
What am  doing
He's standing at the window, staring out
As if Wilson isn't even in the room any more
ship being loaded out there
Inspectors with clipboards
Trucks like the ones we saw at that warehouse downtown
Looking the other way
(turns to go) Gotcha
Along the way up the coast
Through a window we  Valentine and Adhara enjoying a pleasant lunch
The bodyguards hang out by the cars outside with fast food bags and drinks
(to Rick) mean, how much are you getting
Just as a point of interest
See,  didn't realize there was a sliding scale
At a payphone
His idiots in the background
Dials a number
Stacy
Nasty bruise on his cheek
Takes a cue off the rack
Chalks up
Straight rotation, no shit, call your shot
Lemme break
They're playing against a couple of other creeps
You broke last time
Let him break - he likes to break
Fuck you
wouldn't talk
Huh
saw your mother on the Strip last night
She went up to three guys, said she'd like 'em to stick one in each, know what  mean
Creep rushes Stacy
But doesn't get past Uncle John
Who drops him with one punch
Flooring him between two pool tables
Stacy then goes over
Supports himself with a hand on each table, swings his boot into the thug's face
(calls) Stacy
Stacy looks
Bartender holds up phone
Stacy goes over
(cont'd) can do without you inhibiting my business
Stacy just scowls, takes the phone
(into phone) Yeah
Breaks
Hangs up
Goes back to Uncle John
Picks up his cue again
(cont'd) We've been fired
' Someone we've never seen before and will never see again stands in Valentine's driveway
His name is
car comes up
Another guy, , sits in it
He waits
Eventually Fielding walks over
(re:  the burnt garage) Valentine had himself a party,  hear
(by rote) My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events
statement wouldn't mind getting a statement
You see, my client -- the United States Government -- would love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your client
Deals
My client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment
You'd have to be more specific
Your client have a deal in Long Beach
How about downtown
There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead
Any of this ring a bell
My client is an entrepreneur
am his lawyer, not his business manager
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money
He's always been very forward-thinking
He invested wisely
Where is he now
He had urgent business in the north
Gramms just laughs
Just laughs and laughs
And we leave him laughing
And Fielding not
Ed takes off an apron, heads out the door
It's clear that he's not the head chef here -- because the  , an Anglo, turns, wondering where he's going
Over this we hear: (over) Where's Big Sur
(over) Up the coast
(over) How far
(over) don't know -- few hours,  guess
(over) Fancy it
(over) could use a vacation
Of course, keep forgetting, for you this is vacation
(over) Never thought of that
(grunt of laughter) Busman's holiday
(over) What's in Big Sur
(over) That's where Valentine's scarpered
(over) How do you know
(over) Bloke told me
Beat
(cont'd) (over) You shouldn't go back to your place
Not till
this is resolved
Another beat
(over) hear it's a nice drive
Ed gets into Wilson's car
Elaine in there too
Wilson's rented car
Heading for Big Sur
Ed drives
Wilson beside him
Elaine in the back
What d'you say, Elaine
Not much -- you
Same
Uh-huh
Last time  saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing
Probably
was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro
Got three callbacks
Really
Didn't get it
Well, those are the breaks
Not no more, they ain't
quit that acting shit, man
You just cooking then
Hell, no
started writing
Elaine and Wilson exchange glances
Onwards
Stacy and Uncle John sit and drink
Uncle John lamenting their monetary loss
Stacy thinking to himself
We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand
There's more than a measly few grand in this
There is
Something's on
What
happen to know more about Mr
Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks  know about him and his operation
You do
You bet
Like what
Like he'd never hire me for real
Not week-to-week
don't have the credentials
He thinks 'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial
" Well, we blew it, didn't we
He ain't wrong
(savage mimicry) "He ain't wrong
"  Listen,  know this asshole who did just go to work for him
Full-time
And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast
That's the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job
don't get it
don't know who that English guy is
Some kind of -- (finding the word) -- courier or something
Maybe a seller
Maybe a buyer
But Mr
Avery wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and  betcha there's a briefcase somewhere
What's in it
(shrugs) Drugs
Cash
Both if we're lucky
How we gonna get that lucky
While they're all fucking each other over
couple of parties like us could move right in
Wilson's car
Closer to Big Sur
Scenery more magnificent
'
Ed still driving
Wilson next to him
Opening a new cigarette pack
've been wondering something
Again
Do you have any friends, man
Yeah,  suppose
Call 'em that, yeah
Down the boozer Saturday night
Meet some of the lads
(a little more pointed) Friends and colleagues You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble
Number of times a decent job's been cocked up
Poor baby
Little back-seat sarcasm there
Wilson looks kind of bitter
Useless gits
was gonna do the Post Office once
What post office
The lot
The whole British bloody Post Office
had a brilliant plan -- all worked out -- work of genius, it was
Could  get anybody interested
No -- they're too busy pinching orange squash from the milkman
Lazy sods
Jumble sale on in Watford, they'll be up at the crack of dawn
You're just on a higher plane, Wilson
Too bleeding true, 'n' it
Flicks some cigarette pack paper out the window
The car speeds along
An impressive clifftop dwelling
Isolated on a winding road
On a beautiful promontory overlooking the sea
Valentine the  (actually )
It's opened by his ex- wife
Very well-maintained
50-something
Surprised to see him
But not overjoyed
Hello there
What are you doing here
Exercising my visitation rights
Since when
miss my kids
They're at college
Or doesn't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore
Valentine goes inside
He looks around
She doesn't shut the door
You've made it
brighter
don't want you here, Terry
Sure you do
He turns to look at her
Smiles
Somehow it doesn't work on her
One of the reasons she divorced him
Just one
She sighs
Resigned to his presence
Starts to close the door
(cont'd) Don't shut the door --  have people with me
Now she gets it
What kind of trouble are you in
No trouble
Susan  Adhara get out of the sporty car parked in the drive and stand against it in a posture of younger chick defiance
Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway
Susan
He actually puts his hands on her arms
To hold her firm while he locks onto her eyes
And doesn't smile
(cont'd) just need
somewhere remote
Away from
For a couple of days
(now the kicker) pay for this house too
Susan reads him
He's not claiming ownership rights
He's telling her this house, because of the connection to him, is a target of some kind
What have you done
The Land Cruiser pulls up outside
Avery emerges, comes over, comes in
Susan notes the bodyguards out there as well
(to Valentine) We weren't followed
(to Susan) Susan
Valentine lets Susan go
Knowing she's now speechless at what's turned into, as far as she's concerned, a home invasion
(moving, looking around) Where's
what's-his-name -- Fred -- -- You know his name is Frank
Is he here
You know  don't live with him
Go to him
Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp -- Are you finished
In a couple of days this whole thing -- Who's looking for you
Go now
Encouraging, if not in fact ushering, her towards a bedroom
It's been five minutes and 'm packing to leave again
can't believe this
That's right, your life is Shit, and 'm to blame
It's that simple
That does it
Susan turns on him
It is that simple
blame you for everything Losing inhibitions and chicks without bras didn't have to lead to hardcore porno in every American household:  that was you The first on your block to turn on a camera in a hot tub and peddle it to your friends little recreational pot didn't inevitably have to lead to the eventual devastation of the inner cities: you made that happen, the first time you bought a bigger stash than you yourself meant to smoke
It happened when you made your first buck hyping some so-called "event" that was over before it began or marketed some "product" whose only value was its instant disposability
You were the first person to see there was a lot of money to be made selling Navajo rugs -- you've even stolen from the fucking Indians
You looked at Charlie Manson when all he had to show for himself was a guitar instead of a knife and saw another merry prankster, the freedom of the frontier
Your pal here -- (Avery) -- He saw gated communities
Rich people coming to him with their money, terrified of what people like you had left of this society
Why invest in a marriage and children when you had him He's your oracle
But you couldn't even trust in friendship, could you
Still he's the dog you call for its dinner
Because everything that might once have been fun or nice or sweet you had to turn mean and cold and sour
That was your "genius," Terry
Haven't you read your own press
Wilson and his friends pull in
Get out of the car
Stretch
(finding herself at another shithole) What is it, you just like the reassuring smell of disinfectant
Wilson just heads for the motel office
Elaine and Ed follow a little distance behind
Hey, Elaine
You even know what he's saying half the time
No, but  know what he means
Adhara sways in a hammock
Staring at Valentine
Wanting to know what the hell is going on
Valentine stands smoking at the rail, looking out over the dark sea
Ignoring Adhara
Avery sits at a table
Bodyguards visible inside the house
(finally, to Avery) Do any of these guys cook
Wilson at the car
Elaine and Ed watching
Ed has gathered that something has developed between Wilson and Elaine
The way she's looking at Wilson
Reminds me of Jennifer
(barely perceptible nod) Hard to miss
Ed sighs
Awkward
thought maybe you just came for the ride
'd rather be with him than without him
don't want to be found dead in
Wilson walks back to them
Looking at Ed as if to say, ready to go
At her as if to say
maybe farewell
Tableau
Evening has descended
Surfaces glisten from a light drizzling rain
,
Adhara, dressing
Behind her, outside, way out of focus, a figure slithers by
,
Valentine and Avery sit watching  (
)
Tom is behind them in the kitchen, flipping through Marie Claire magazine
Turns to look through the sliding glass doors
Beyond the deck stands Larry, his back to us, facing the ocean
Looking toward the house, Larry in the foreground, facing us
He takes a bite from a cinnamon granola bar, then looks at it unhappily as he chews
Fuck
,
Looking at the house from the top of the hill
Rick stands in the driveway next to Valentine's car, smoking a cigarette
Wilson and Ed watching him
Wilson nods his head to the left, and Ed moves in that direction
Wilson moves quietly off to the right
Valentine and Avery, still watching
(re:  the channel) Check the news
Avery starts looking around
Where's the remote
Suddenly, we hear a
Tom looks up from his magazine
Valentine looks to Avery, who shakes his head: It's nothing
Rick turns and looks up the driveway toward the sound
He puts his cigarette out
Larry has turned toward the sound as well
Through a partially obscured side entrance, he sees Rick walking up the driveway
Rick walks away from us, toward the vehicle (the Land Cruiser they drove here) parked up the driveway
We lose sight of him as he crosses to the driver's side
The alarm goes off
We hold for several beats
He doesn't emerge
Valentine and Avery are still looking for the remote
Avery stops, his attention drawn to the fact that he hasn't heard anything from Larry
He crosses to the window
The driveway, car at the top partially visible
No sign of Rick
His brow furrows
Notices this, looks out toward the backyard
Same as before, except Larry isn't there
Moves to the sliding glass door to get a better look at the deck and back yard
Still no Larry
Where's Larry
Leaves the window and moves to Valentine
Tom has joined them
After a beat: Turn all the lights out
'll get Adhara
Tom begins looking for the light switches
What's happening
Avery is already heading for the bedroom
Stay away from the windows
Tableau
Avery exits the kitchen and takes the surrounding porch to the bedroom
Are we seeing this from someone's
Adhara, finished dressing, looking at herself in the mirror
The lights behind her go off
She turns to see Avery coming toward her to turn off the lights by the mirror
Uh, you've heard of knocking
need you to come with me
Why, what -- He takes her by the arm
Firmly, but not roughly
Please
She sees in his expression that something is up
Okay
Tom and Valentine have finally found the light switches, and the room is dark
Valentine moves slowly to the window, takes a tentative peek
The driveway
Hard to see
Is there something moving out by the shed
(off) thought  said stay away from the window
Entering the kitchen with Adhara in tow
He brings her around behind the counter
Everybody in the kitchen
Valentine and Tom move to join Avery and Adhara
Behind the counter
Everyone moves behind the large counter in the center of the kitchen and crouches down
They have a wall behind them and all the windows in front of them
(scared) What's going on
Avery and Tom have drawn their guns
We think someone is here
We think
We can't find
(what are their names
) two of our guys
(fucking typical) Larry and Rick
Did somebody call the cops
Tom snorts
Avery looks at Valentine:  Haven't you told this girl anything
No
Why not
Because -- Because 'm taking care of it
You guys are fucking nuts, 'm calling -- She starts to stand
Valentine pulls her down
Hey
Mr
Avery
Avery looks to Tom, who nods toward the back porch
silhouetted figure is tentatively making its way along the porch, trying not to be seen
We don't get a very clear glimpse
Draws his gun and takes aim
Careful not to become fully visible, but growing more courageous with each step
Locked on him, waiting
Puts Adhara's hand to her ears
We see a little more now than we have before
He sees enough
Squeezes off a series of , the muzzle flash strobing the kitchen area like a flashbulb, Adhara and Valentine flinching
Hit
Spinning and collapsing to the ground
Lowers his gun
Turns to Tom
Watch my back
Avery moves out from behind the counter and heads for the body
Avery makes his way to the figure, which is on its stomach and writhing slightly
Careful
Takes the gun and turns the body over
Stares up at him, choking on his last few breaths
Puzzled
What the hell is this guy doing here
He starts feeling around Stacy's jacket for anything useful, but is interrupted when his hand , accompanied by the sound of a gunshot
He screams in pain
Valentine and Adhara drop to the floor
Tom, gun raised and pointing, tries to see who shot Avery
Avery is turning toward his assailant, but not fast enough
shot rings out and part of his neck disappears in a blossom of blood
Stunned, he falls on his side, gasping
' Uncle John
Close by, huddled by the lip of the cliff
He starts to move cautiously toward Avery and Stacy
Tom squints, trying to see
Fuck
What
Avery's down
' piece of Uncle John's silhouette appears
Fires at it
Didn't hit anything
Fuck this
Tom jumps up and runs for the living room, firing his gun in front of him toward where he last saw Uncle John's silhouette
Tom runs through and reaches the sliding doors to the back porch
portion of the frame  from a gun shot as he gains access to the other side of the back porch
Tom is through the sliding doors and trying to make his way around to the driveway
Crouched behind the opposite end of the porch, sticks his head up
Tom crossing to the steps, slips on the damp wood, tries to right himself
Squeezes off two shots
Is shot in the ankle as he is about to reach the steps
He yelps in pain, tries to raise his gun
Crouched down
shot flies over his head
Stops shooting
Tries dragging his shattered ankle to the steps
Looks over the edge of the porch
Tom turning toward the steps
Fires at him
Screams again as his elbow of his gun hand disintegrates
He slips on the first step and tumbles down, the gun bouncing beside him
Sees this
Stands up to cross the back porch
Takes a step forward but is stopped by a bullet in the chest (about the only clean shot anybody makes)
He looks down at himself
Shit
He looks up to : Near death
Gun in his good hand
He squeezes the trigger again
small black hole appears in his cheek
He blinks, begins to raise his hand to his face, and collapses
Exhales and rolls over
Still trying to get to his feet
He gives up and just lies there, panting
Reaches for the gun beside Tom
Tilt up with it to reveal: He puts the gun in his jacket and slides away
Valentine and Adhara are still stuck behind the counter
Valentine sees the shadowy shape of Ed slipping behind the back porch
Decides to make a run for it, following Tom's route, away from Ed
Where are you going
Valentine runs to the sliding door, smack into: Standing there
Wet
Mad
He grabs Valentine by the shirt and pushes him back into the room
Bounces off the couch and onto the floor
Comes toward him
Grabs a lamp off an end table and hurls it at Wilson
It careens off Wilson's arm and shatters
Is almost on him now
Tries to scramble away
Throwing anything he can get his hands on at
Who keeps coming
He grabs Valentine, pulls him up, then throws him into the television
Crashes into the  face first and bounces to the floor
Goes to him, grabs him by the neck with one hand and pulls out his gun with the other
He seems about to speak when suddenly he screams instead
Has just stuck a kitchen knife into Wilson's back
Turns instinctively and whips the pistol around, smashing Adhara in the mouth
Hits the ground
She won't be retaliating
In agony, spinning, trying to reach the knife in his back, but '
Scrambles through the sliding glass door
Valentine stumbles out
Notices Avery slumped on the deck, mortally wounded
Goes to him -- as if concerned -- but actually just to take the gun
Then runs off the porch toward the  that lead down to the sea
Comes out after him, the knife still in his back
So intent on catching Valentine he fails at first to notice Avery lying in the shadows
Has just barely managed to reach Stacy's pistol
Raises it weakly
Points it at Wilson
Seems to feel it
Turns
Locks eyes with Avery
Avery could already have shot him
But there's a momentary sense of recognition:  both of them just foot soldiers for fat cats -- and Avery's is not worth saving
Lowers the gun
Nods in the direction Valentine went
that way
Wilson moves on
Avery just lies there, presumably to die
Valentine hurries down the rickety steps
Trying not to slip in the darkness, though there are tiny Malibu lights illuminating the steep and winding wooden framework
rocky cove
Valentine looks back up the way he came, the  coming down after him
Backs away a few paces on the slippery rocks
Falls
Lands on the crumpled, dead body of , the bodyguard, who was thrown off the cliff
Valentine recoils
When Wilson appears, Valentine  at him
wild shot that only makes Wilson duck momentarily
Valentine scrambles to his feet, runs on
Jumps down from the steps
Stops for a moment and leans his back against the railing
Bends at the knees slightly
The handle is forced upward just enough to be reachable now
Grimacing, pulls the knife out and discards it
Valentine runs
Or tries to
It's dark and the ground is treacherous
The beach runs out pretty soon
Now just rocks
Maybe he thought he could get around the rocks on the point at the other end
But he can't see very far ahead
And the tide is in, water making any escape extremely difficult
He tries to scramble over some rocks
They're wet, slippery
He falls, cries out as he literally breaks an ankle
dark figure
Coming into focus
Walking inexorably this way
Painfully rights himself
small bone protrudes from his broken ankle
He  at Wilson, gun in one hand, other hand gripping his wrist to try and steady it
Doing his best to aim
But the  miss their mark
Steadily coming
Out of bullets now
Gun  crazily on empty
He simply drops it
Now stands before him
Both breathing hard
Tell me
This is not what Valentine expected
What
Tell me
Tell you
About Jenny
(closer) Tell me about Jenny
(closer) About the deal Whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it, you bastard
Wilson drops to the ground too, in a passionate fury, starts strangling Valentine
Tell me
Tell me about it, you fucking bastard
Easing up just enough for Valentine to sputter out a response
She could've had the deal
would've handed it to her if she wanted
would have given her everything
Why then
Why did you do it
They're locked in a kind of embrace
Sprayed by the waves crashing into the rocks
Sweating and gasping and exhausted and hurt and furious
She didn't want to share it, she wanted to stop it
To stop me
She said she'd turn me in Shock of recognition on his face
At those words
She said, "You go ahead with this, 'll turn you in, Terry
" Wilson sits back
Panting
Totally spent
The two of them
Both on the ground now
Whatever energy they had left drained -- Valentine from his confession, Wilson from hearing it
Valentine shaking, sobbing
Still not realizing the pathetic folly of his actions
She was serious
She would have done it
She had the phone in her hand
She was going to do it
Knows that the girl he loved
loved Valentine, too
Having heard the truth, the last vestige of revenge has vanished
He gets up and walks away
Leaving the quivering shell of Valentine behind
Adhara wakes up
Hand to her smashed cheek and mouth
But it's not her hand
It's Valentine's
She sort of shuffles away from him along the floor
Sits against a wall holding her face
Valentine sits back against an opposite wall
They stare at each other
Wilson, lost in thought
Accepts a drink from a We can see it pains him to reach for it
Ta
After setting the glass down, his other hand goes to the shoulder where his stab wound was no doubt only temporarily dealt with
: At the roadside hotel, grimacing
Cleaning his wound
Wilson rubs his shoulder
The   in the seat beside him heard the way he said thanks to the Flight Attendant
You're English
small beat (which he takes each time he responds)
Yeah, that's right
can never decide what  like better
Leaving home, or coming back
Takes this in
: Shaving in the mirror at his
motel
He stops
In the car leaving Valentine's house
Fingering the picture of Jenny
would have preferred staying home, me
You're a reluctant traveller, then
Wilson nods
: In the car with Elaine and Ed, driving back from Big Sur
Everyone in their own world
At Ed's house
Saying goodbye
Shake hands
Watching him get into Elaine's car
Got called out to
, unexpected like, to do a job of work
: At the airport, staring at Elaine
Staring back
She embraces him
She watches him leave
Disappearing into the terminal
You'll be looking forward to getting back, then
Yeah
Another little matter needs attending to soon as  return
No rest for the wicked
Wilson nods, exhales
: In the cab on the way to Ed's, at the beginning of the film
Watching the lights go by
Been away a lot
Where else
Longer beat
He actually turns to look at her now
Takes her in, then looks forward again
Out on a oil rig
In the North Sea
Nine years
Nine years
(laughs) Is that legal
Well, time off for good behavior, you know
shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place
got lumbered with the job they were responsible for don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what  mean
But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time
had to, didn't
Nothing else for it
Then just when 'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop,  had to bugger off to the States
(reacting slightly to his "colorful" language) Sounds like you need a rest
Could do, yeah
Another beat
But first  gotta give these lads a talking to, these geezers what sent me up the river, in a manner of speaking
The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders
Yeah
And he turns away, to the window
Looks at the blue sky
Sips his drink
Then, hard: Them next
