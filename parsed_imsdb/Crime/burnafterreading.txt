The eastern seaboard stretches away, flecked with clouds
As we dissolve in closer the picture bleaches of color
We are looking down at the city of Washington,
Dissolve closer still: a black-and-white aerial photograph of a neighborhood in suburban
dominated by a sprawling building
Computer type quickly bleeps on: Headquarters Langley, Virginia 2

'  -                                       3 We hear a door opening and a silver-haired man rises behind his desk
nameplate on the desk identifies him as Palmer DeBakey Smith
Ozzie
Sit down
Osbourne Cox, entering, is a middle-aged man in a striped shirt and bow tie
Palmer
What's up
You know Peck, and Olson
The two men, sitting on chairs facing the desk, nod at Osbourne, who is surprised to see them
Peck, yes, hiya
Olson, by reputation
Hi, Osbourne Cox
Yeah, hiyah
2
Aren't you with
aren't you, uh
Palmer jumps in: Yeah, that's right
Oz, look
There's no easy way to say this
We're taking you off the Balkans desk
You're----what
Why
In fact we're moving you out of Sigint entirely
What
No discussion, just----you're out
Well, we're having the discussion now Oz
This doesn't have to be unpleasant
Palmer, with all due respect----what the fuck are you talking about

(') And why is Olson here
Another uncomfortable beat
Look, Ozzie---- What the fuck is this
Is it my---- know it's not my work
Ozzie---- 'm a great fucking analyst
Is it---- Oz, things are not going well
As you know

You have a drinking problem
Stunned silence
Ozzie turns to look at Peck
At length: have a drinking problem
This doesn't have to be unpleasant
We found you something in State
It's a, uh
He gropes, uncomfortable
(') It's a lower clearance level
Yes
But we're not, this isn't, we're not terminating you
(quietly) This is an assault
Come on, Ozzie
This is an assault
have a drinking problem
Fuck you, Peck, you're a Mormon
Ozzie---- Next to you we all have a drinking problem
Fuck you guys
Whose ass didn't  kiss
Let's be honest
Palmer nods at Olson
Okay, Olson---- Let's be fucking honest
Osbourne gets to his feet, agitated

This is political
Don't tell me it's not

-                                             4 Bow tie loosened, he stands at a kitchen counter
His shoulders twist as he does something below frame: we hear the crackle of ice cubes wrenching loose from a tray
Behind him we see the apartment door opening
Katie, an attractive middle-aged woman, enters, taking her key out of the door, but stops, surprised to see Osbourne
You're home
Osbourne continues making himself a drink
Hang on to your hat, honey
have some news
---- Did you pick up the cheeses
Huh
Were they ready
didn't know you were coming home this early
(blank) The cheeses
Katie rolls her eyes

left a message for you to stop at Todaro's
The Magruders and the Pfarrers are coming over
The Pfarrers
Ugh
----what did Kathleen say
What
When you left the message
She said
She would give you
The message
Well she,  don't know,  guess we had bigger news today
My day didn't revolve arou---- So you didn't get the cheeses
Well, since  didn't get the message, no,  didn't get the cheeses
But hang on to your hat, ---- Oh for fuck's sake, Ozzie, you mean have to go out again
All right, well, you better get dressed
Honey, we have to talk
Not right now
They'll be here in, what, less than an hour

Is this a, uh, goat cheese
() Chevre, yes, that is a goat cheese

Wider shows the cocktail party, meagerly attended but in full swing
Besides Osbourne and Katie there is Harry Pfarrer (who has just inquired about the cheese), bearded, forties, rugged; his wife Sandy; and a shiny-faced young couple, Doug and Tina Magruder
Osbourne holds a cocktail tumbler
Because  have lactose reflux
But can---- You're lactose intolerant
Yes, but  can---- Or you have acid reflux
They're two different things
Harry looks at him coldly
know what they are
Then you misspoke yourself
So ---- Thank you for correcting me
You should try the chevre, Harry
It's very good
Yeah
can eat goat cheese
He eats a piece, cupping one hand under his mouth
(') was just explaining to your husband here,  have a condition---- Katie tries to separate the two men by including Doug Magruder
Harry works with the Marshalls'                       * Service

Very amusing
The gun is actually no big deal
Twenty years in the marshall's service and 've never discharged my weapon
Sounds like something you should be telling your psychiatrist
What
don't have a psychiatrist
Boy,  guess my job is pretty undramatic
'm on the legislative side
What do you do Mrs
Pfarrer
Do you also carry a gun
Harry laughs
Sandy writes children's books

Who
arghh----Who---- Choking on piece of cheese, coughing (') Who Lives In The Rotunda
Excuse me
Those are wonderful
My nieces and nephews---- 8
Yeah, it's a beloved series
You wouldn't believe her fan mail
Unghh
Are you sure this is goat cheese
Why don't you let your wife tell them about her own books, Harry

Goddamnit
He knows, doesn't he
He looks down at the floor
He stamps
(') Nice floors
Knows what
Harry is looking around the kitchen, taking in the fixtures
Absently: About us, he knows about us

Don't be an ass, he doesn't know a thing

Finally: What a horse's ass
don't know why we see them
Harry shrugs
Well, she's all right
She is a cold, stuck-up bitch
Harry opens his mouth to reply, considers, doesn't
They drive
8
-                                8 She is staring, in front of a mirror, face covered in cold cream, one hand arrested on the way up to daub on more
You quit
Osbourne is buttoning a pajama top
Uh-huh
Well----Thank you for letting me know
tried to tell you this afternoon
You tried
You tried
And then---- what, the aphasia kicked in
Our guests came
We---- 10
Why
For fuck's sake, Ozzie
'm just---- don't know
got so tired
You're tired
Tired of swimming against the current
Uh-huh
Independent thought is not only not valued there, they resist it, they fight it, the bureaucracy is positively---- Did you get a pension, or severance or something, or---- didn't retire you know, ,  quit
don't want their benefits
But  suppose my benefits are all right,  suppose you can live with those, is that the idea
It's not like that's the only way to make money
Yes
Yes
What're you gonna do
'll do some consulting
Consulting
Yes, to help while ----'ve always wanted to write

She bursts into laughter

/  -                                         9 small yacht
Osbourne stands at the wheel, a light wind in his face, as the boat sails under motor power
After a beat he moves to the front of the boat
An old man sits on a bench on the prow facing out into the wind
He has snowy hair and a stern Yankee face
He wears a tweed cap
He doesn't much react to Osbourne's approach
You okay there, Dad
The old man remains silent, staring
Osbourne sits next to him and idly tucks in the plaid blanket resting over the man's knees
(') Dad,  left my job at the Agency
The old man stares out into the wind
(') , uh
'm sorry
Dad, government service is not what it was when you were in State
Things are different now
don't know, maybe it's
it's
the Cold War ending; now it seems like it's all bureaucracy and no mission
The old man stares out into the wind
(') 'm writing a memoir
think it's going to be pretty explosive
But  don't think you'll disapprove
don't think you'll disapprove
Katie has had trouble accepting it
() 12
(') But
sometimes there's a higher patriotism, Dad
So we'll
Yes, change is hard
It's hard on Katie
But we'll be okay
We'll be okay
Life is change
This is good
We were all blocked up, Katie and me
This is, this is a blessing in disguise
'll go into training, you know
Lay off the sauce
Like you did
You managed to do it
Finally
And then  can concentrate on, you know
New beginning
And this'll all have been for the best
Don't you think Dad
The old man stares out into the wind
Osbourne sniffles
(') Cold
He taps the old man on the knee and rises
(') guess we should head back

-                                                 10 The sailboat docked at the end of a marina
Osbourne is pushing the old man in a wheel chair down the pier away from the boat
' We've seen this
11
-   -                           11 White hair, bushy eyebrows, a florid face
He is in a law- book lined conference room
He wears an expensive suit, suspenders, a white shirt with blue collar and cuffs
He is Bogus Terikhian
know this kind of man
We've seen this
13
Wider on the conference room shows that Katie Cox sits at the table, along with Terikhian, another lawyer, and an assistant
(') Mrs
Cox, you can't let this man take advantage of you
And he will
He will
Yes
This is my fear
He's trying---- he says----he's trying to pull himself together, but
Look, sure, ----'m obliged to tell you you should try to salvage things
And you should
People turn themselves around
Not unheard-of
But
You---- you haven't broached the possibility of divorce yet
No
Well that's good
Because first you should get all his financials
Before he's forewarned
Because here's a man, here's a man, practiced in deceit, this is almost, you could say it's his job, practiced at hiding things, and there is no reason, it is not improper, there is no reason for you not to get a picture of the household finances
Paper files, computer files, whatever----this is your prerogative
You can be a spy too, madam
Do this before you put him on alert
Before the turtle can draw in his head and his, uh
He waggles his hands, groping for the word
(') Feet
He shrugs
(') And hopefully everything will work out
He will reform
But
If not: forewarned is forearmed

-                                             12 Osbourne is splayed on an easy chair, wearing a bathrobe over pyjamas
He stares at the ceiling, motionless, arms out- flung, like Marat in his bathtub
long still beat
clock ticks
Abruptly Osbourne raises one hand to speak into a microcassette recorder
We were young and committed and there was nothing we couldn't do
We thought of the Agency less as
less as
The thought, such as it was, peters out
Osbourne rises and wanders around the room, glassy-eyed
He suddenly raises the microcassette again
(') The principles of George Kennan----a personal hero of mine----were what animated us
In fact they were what had originally inspired me to enter government service
Like the State Department's China Hands of yore, or, in a different forum, in a different venue, in a different medium, in, um
"Murrow's Boys," the fabled----in a different---- He suddenly stops, head cocked, listening
Faintly, a ringing phone
13
-                                 13 At the cut Osbourne is thundering down a steep carpeted stairway
He inclines his head to clear the ceiling that juts over the bottom half of the stairwell
The phone is louder here
14
-                                          14 semi-finished basement with cheap paneling and a low dropped ceiling of water-stained Johnson-Armstrong tile
The ringing phone is on a cheap government-surplus desk
The answering machine, with Osbourne's voice, picks up: 15
You have reached The Cox Group
Osbourne, robe flapping, shuffles hurriedly in his slippered feet toward the phone
(') We can't answer your call right now
Please leave a---- (heavy breathing) Hello
He eases into the chair, having swiped up the phone listening beat
(') Yes
Oh, no
No, call her number
No, upstairs
No she's not, but leave it on her machine
15
-  -                                      15 We are looking over Osbourne's shoulder----he is still in his robe----as he sits hunched on an ottoman, looking at a daytime game show
few beats of the show
Roaring laughter from the studio audience
Mild chuckle from Osbourne in the foreground
16      -  -                                  16 Ticking clock
Osbourne paces with the microcassette recorder
He raises it with a thought, draws a breath, and then stops, and looks off
The ticking grandfather clock: ornate hands on an ornate clock face Two or three minutes to five
Osbourne stares for a long beat
17
-                                              17 Shoulders twisting as we hear ice clattering out of a tray
He pours coke sizzling onto the ice
16
He pauses for a long beat
He takes a bottle of rum out of a cabinet
He pours some into a hatch-marked shot glass
He looks at it
The amber liquid tops the hatch mark
He conscientiously pours the overage back, murmuring: Single
He dumps the shot into the Coke
18
-                                             18 As before, the boat, docked at the end of the marina pier, is seen in long shot through the windshield of a car
Closer on the boat
As water laps against pilings and the boat gently bobs and creaks, we hear, muffled, the sounds of a couple having sex
When it builds to climax we cut: 19
-                                             19 Minutes later
We hold on a door for a quiet beat, then we hear the gurgle of water, and then the door opens
Harry Pfarrer emerges from the small bathroom, buckling his belt
In the bedroom which he emerges into Katie Cox is just finishing dressing
Harry looks at his watch
should try to get a run in
20
-                                            20 Katie is letting herself in

-                                              21 Katie enters and sees a note on the counter paperweighted by a plate of used lime wedges: 17
Honey, At Fenninger's
Reunion committee dinner
See you later
22
-                                          22 Long-lens, hand-held, point-of-view seeming: Harry Pfarrer is jogging in his Treasury sweats
Closer on him
Brow furrows
He spins, jogs backwards, looking
His point-of-view: nothing unusual; traffic on the bridge, no pedestrians particularly close
Harry, mildly puzzled, slows and stops
He turns again
Point-of-view up the bridge: empty
Harry starts jogging again
23
-                                           23 We are tracking toward the desk in the corner, at which Katie sits
She cracks open a  case and loads the  into Osbourne's computer
suspense drone builds as we track in
Katie starts typing, then suddenly stops
She holds still, listening for noises in the house
Nothing
She resumes typing
We hear male voices beginning to swell in song
The voices continue after the suspense drone snaps off, at the cut to: 24
' -                                            24 musty steakhouse
On the walls are hunting-scene prints and steel engravings of English country houses

Bid every care withdraw
Let all with one accord rejoice
The men are sweaty, tie-loosened, dinner-stuffed and boozy
(') In praise of Old Nassau
Close on Osbourne as a rotund middle-aged classmate fills his glass to brimming
The two sway unsteadily with the music
(') In praise of Old Nassau my boys, Hoo-rah, hoo-rah, hoorah
All swing their glasses side-to-side in rhythm: (') Her sons

Glasses are thrust high with a ringing finish: (') In praise of Old Nassau

And the upper arms
And a little off your tummy
The camera is arcing around a standing, naked, middle-aged woman, to reveal the doctor sitting on a stool in the examining room, facing her
He reaches forward again with the marker
19
() (') And we do breast augmentation with a tiny incision here
and here
() Uh-huh
And what about the thigh area
Well we can do liposuction there as well, but that area will respond to exercise
Buttocks and upper arms begin to store more fat when you get up around forty, the body just tells it to go there, but the thighs will respond to toning exercises
Uh-huh
know,  can work out on my arms til the cows come home, but

And of course there are also genetic factors
The Litzkes are big

Not too tight, though

(ticks them off) The liposuction
The rhinoplasty
The facial tuck, which  would strongly recommend over the chemical peel---- 21
Yeah,  don't want to get anything burned off
And why should you
With that lovely skin
And lastly, the breast augmentation
Now we can also do something about the vaccine scar---- don't know if you wear sleeveless dresses much---- Not with these ham hocks
Yes, well once they're nice and svelte, post-op, you---- Well  don't know

And you should be getting rid of that bozo

No, you can't go like that
You gotta wear a suit
Well----you mean----go home and change

restaurant in the middle of lunch
----which to my mind is all the more reason to lower the boom on Ozzie
Mm
That's it
"Mm"
'm just
wondering if it's the right time
54
Of course it's the right time
Why wouldn't it be the right time
Does it threaten you
No no
No, you and me are rock solid
That's why , uh,  think we can afford to be big
We can think about Ozzie, whether maybe we should let him get himself together a little before you hammer him with, um---- Is that how you see me, "hammering" him
Of course not, but---- Weren't those your words
Yes, but---- don't "hammer
" No, uh-huh, of course not
But, 'm saying----'m no friend of the guy
You know that
think he's an arrogant little geek
But for Christ sakes, you and me have all the time in the world, and he just lost his job---- He didn't lose it, he quit
Yeah
Most of the people who "quit" in this town were fired
Katie looks at Harry, reckoning
He returns her look with an open one

And he'll be easier to deal with when he doesn't feel
cornered
55
Maybe
As long as we're talking about Ozzie and not you
Of course we're talking about Ozzie
Baby,  stand by you whatever you do
adore you
She nods, thinking, still gazing at him
Her cell phone chirps and she reaches into her purse
Please get the check
She flips open the phone

Yes
Is there blood in his stool
Yes, soon
She looks at her watch, rises

Wider shows Osbourne Cox, sitting in a car parked on a downtown street, consulting his watch
He looks up, irritated, and glances around
His look is arrested by: The side-view mirror
It shows a man approaching on bicycle along the sidewalk wearing a suit and a bike helmet
The man dismounts several paces behind the parked car, locks his bike to a fence separating the sidewalk from a small park, and takes off his helmet
It is Chad
He walks along the sidewalk to the car, opens the passenger door and sits in with his bike helmet clamped under one arm
56
Osbourne Cox
And you,  take it, are "Mr
Black"
Yes  am
You have the money
The fifty-thousand dollars
That's what was agreed upon, Osbourne Cox
All right
Let me explain something to you, "Mr
Black
" You know who am;  know who you are
(smug) Perhaps
But appearances can be---- deceptive
Yeah
What you're engaged in is blackmail, which is a felony
That's for starters
Appearances can be----deceptive

If you ever carried out your proposed threat, you would experience such a shitstorm of consequences, my friend, it would make your empty little head spin faster than your Schwinn bicycle over there
Chad chuckles
You think that's a Schwinn
Now give me the fucking floppy or the or whatever the fuck you have it on, and  will---- 57
As soon as you give me the money, dickwad
'm not----Huhgf
Osbourne has punched him in the nose
Chad stares at him, stunned
His nose starts bleeding

He slams the door

He pulls out
You're the fucker
There is the honk of a car horn----not Osbourne's
Chad looks, surprised
Linda is pulling up
Her passenger window rolls down
Where's the money

Suddenly he sobers
Wait, wait

The car is ripping through traffic

Behind the desk sits a sixtyish Russian functionary with the beetle-browed sphynx-like look of the Brezhnev-era bureaucrat
This is Krapotkin

She trails off, nodding encouragingly at Krapotkin
Krapotkin looks blankly back

Yes
She rummages in her handbag and pulls out the diskette
She holds it aloft, waggling it for Krapotkin
Krapotkin stares
Linda sets the diskette on the table and slides it across
This is just a taste
After a beat of looking at the proffered diskette, Krapotkin leans forward to take it
Linda smiles
Krapotkin turns the diskette over a couple of times, looks sadly up
May  ask the source of this
Linda slowly shakes her head, eyes locked on Krapotkin

Can you tell me where this material comes from
Linda makes a pantomime of zipping her lip
The man looks at her impassively

Its function is obscure

He pushes the seat with his foot
It slides forward then back, forward and back, rocking
On its forward arc a dildo emerges from the center of the seat's pipe-track, angled toward the seat-bottom which is cleft to accommodate its entrance

Katie Cox emerges from the driver's side
Reverse shows Chad, in his suit, watching from a parked car across the street
Now Harry Pfarrer emerges from the passenger side wearing a brown pin-striped suit
Encumbered by something bulky he follows Katie up the walk
It seems to be some kind of pillow or cushion under his arm, but very large, and wedge-shaped
Katie is letting herself in; Harry gives a furtive glance around----as Chad sinks back in his car seat----before entering with the wedge-cushion
The door closes
Chad relaxes, straightens up

Harry follows in sweats
They get into her car
It pulls out
Chad watches it go up the street
He is about to open his door but pauses, seeing: The parked car up the street
Katie's car having passed, it now pulls out and follows at a discreet distance
Both cars disappear
Chad opens his door and gets out
He is crossing to the townhouse when he notices another car parked on the other side of the street
man sits in the driver's seat, smoking
Chad proceeds on to the house
There is a barred garden- level door tucked under the stoop
Chad checks out the caging on the door
He looks up the facade of the house

Five point two
Okay, fine---- gotta do at least five
Five and a deuce is okay

Chad gives a quick glance around
97

The garden steps down to a back door
Chad checks out the windows in back, then goes to the door
It is locked
It has a large window

Harry cuts across a park lawn

Emerging from the park onto another street

He is looking idly around, heading toward the front door when a shape materializes in its frosted glass sidelight
Chad freezes
There is scraping at the lock
Chad quickly mounts the stairs
105
-   -                           105 Chad freezes, listening
The downstairs door swings open, shut
Footsteps
tread on the stairs: Chad scurries into the first open door
106
-  -                                106 Chad hotfoots into a closet and eases its door most of the way shut
The footsteps mount the stairs
Chad peeks out
His : The bed, bedclothes rumpled
In the middle of the bed, a wedge-cushion
77
Beyond, the open bedroom door shows a slice of hallway and stairs
Harry arrives at the top of the stairs
He nudges back a drape on the window at the top of the steps
He looks down one way, then the other
He lets the drape fall back and seems to relax
Harry enters the bedroom
He strips off his shirt and steps out of his pants on his way into the bathroom off the master bedroom
He leaves the door open
Chad reaches gingerly for the closet door to close it but stops abruptly as we hear the shower turned off and the curtain whipped back
Harry emerges from the shower
He rinses off, humming "Born Free," and walks into the foreground pulling on shorts and shirt and a pair of dress pants that was draped across a bureau
Chad shrinks back into the closet as Harry approaches
Harry stops, just outside the cracked door
Through the crack we see only the white of his shirt
Abruptly Harry turns his back to us and recedes into the room and bends to pick something off the floor
Chad leans in ever so slightly to see, but draws back again as Harry approaches
Chad looks over to his right: on a hanger, the brown pinstripe coat that matches Harry's pants
The closet door is thrown open
Nuhhh
Harry jerks up the gun which he's pulled from the shoulder holster in his other hand and--------shoots Chad in the face
The gun bucks
Unused to the recoil and still screaming, Harry staggers back and trips over the edge of the bed and drops the weapon
He crabs briefly backward and then flips over and scrambles off on all fours
In the hallway he rises and tramples down the stairs
78
107
-    -                      107 He stops at the bottom of the steps, panting
He looks back up the steps, trying to control his heavy breathing so that he can listen
long silence
Hello
No answer
He looks around
108
-  -                               108 Harry enters
He opens a drawer, closes it, opens another
109
-  -                                 109 Harry enters from the kitchen and starts slowly mounting the stairs, a chopping knife in one hand
Hello
110
-   -                          110 Harry tops the stairs
He pauses, looking at: The bedroom door, ajar
Inside, his gun lies on the floor
Harry takes cautious steps toward the door
He pauses at the cracked door
Suddenly: Hungh
He plunges through the door and runs for the gun and scoops it, dropping the knife
He stands and spins, panting
His point-of-view: the closet
Its door ajar
Legs protrude into the room as if Chad, hidden within, is sitting with his back against the closet wall contemplating his next move
79
Harry walks cautiously over
With a bare foot he experimentally waggles one of Chad's feet
Limp
Harry nudges the door
(') Hello
It creaks fully open

Inside are a few dollars and nothing else: no credit cards, driver's license; empty
(') What the fuck
He leans back in, trying not to look, but for some reason feeling obliged to return the wallet
As he opens the suit coat to slip it back in the inside pocket he notices: The suit label has been cut away
He fingers the raveled fringe

Palmer
What's up
81
Not quite certain, sir, but it's
messy
He seats himself facing the desk
desktop nameplate identifies his superior as Gardner McC
Chubb
Palmer hands a folder across, grimacing
(') Kolyma-2 tells us that they have computer files from an ex-analyst of mine, Osbourne Cox
Kolyma-2
Our man in the Russian Embassy
Mm
It was brought to them by a woman who---- The Russians
Yeah
It was brought in by Linda Litzke, an associate of a guy named Harry Pfarrer
Picture's in the folder
With Pfarrer's
The Russians
Yeah
Who's Pfarrer
Treasury agent who's been, um, screwing Mrs
Cox
Must be how they got the files
Or maybe Ozzie knows about it, they all seem to be sleeping with each other
All right
Spare me
82
Yes sir
But this Treasury guy----it's gotten
complicated
He just shot somebody in Ozzie's house
Shot----your analyst
Palmer shakes his head
Ozzie wasn't there
Our man surveying hears a gunshot, sees the Treasury guy wrestle something into his car, follows him; he dumps a body in the Chesapeake Bay
Well----what'd he do that for
Don't know sir
Oh for Christ sake
Anyone fish the body out
Mm-hm

American
Don't know
Scrubbed of

Okay
Okay, no biggie
He reaches the folder back to Palmer

Right, sir
And----we'll interface with the  on this, uh, dead body

We are in her cubicle now, her weeping bumping up at the cut

Is Chad running from something
Ted, we know what we're doing
Let me ask you this: did he know my name
Whuh----yes, he was asking about you
Employment history, et cetera

Well, we

He tries to cover his reaction to the physical contact

Outside her cubicle window Ted waits; at Linda's look he turns palms up: What's going on

He is intensely focused and chops very, very quickly, producing slices in high volume
Reverse shows Katie Cox in a chair in the living room, frozen in a look up, a file of papers forgotten in one hand as she gazes over half-glasses at Harry
His chopping continues unabated
After a long look and much chopping: You seem distracted
(still chopping) Do
Very distracted
The last two days
Nn
Work
The chopping continues
Katie's eyes shift down to the countertop, back up to Harry
Another beat
That's enough carrots, don't you think

Huh
For the salad
The chopping stops
Harry slaps the knife down
He stares at Katie, jaw grinding, for a beat
You know: you're really a very negative person
What
Through grit teeth: 've tried
To ignore it
And stay upbeat
Katie, unused to backtalk from Harry, is stunned
She returns in a manner as hard as his: Harry: stop the foolishness
Stop the foolishness
Yes
And behave
You are not talking to one of your
Her fingers form quotes: (') "shithole buddies
" Harry glares at her, vibrating with rage
Her look at him is equally hard
Harry abruptly turns and stomps up the stairs
Brief tromping on the second floor
Katie sits in puzzled suspense
Footfalls descend the staircase

Okay

Love you too
He folds the phone, miserable
As he pockets it his attention is caught by something in the side-view mirror: The car parked across the street
man's shape in the driver's seat

The parked car starts
Hey
Fucker
The car tries to pull out but is closely hemmed in by cars front and back; it will need a couple moves
Harry runs back to his own car, starts it, throws it into reverse and backs straight down the drive toward the frantically shuttling car
He t-bones it
Fucker
Harry, amped, throws his car into drive, pulls halfway up the driveway
Fucker
Fucker
He again throws the car into reverse
The man in the other car abandons his attempt to pull out and scrambles frantically toward the passenger side
Harry again smashes into the car

-                          121 * The other man emerges from the far side
He flees down the sidewalk as fast as his weight will permit, pocket change jingling, yelling as he runs: Fucker
Harry runs after him, calling: Who do you work for
Who do you work for
Pounding footsteps
(') Tell me
The overweight man does not have Harry's stamina: Harry closes, leaps, and tackles
He crawls up the man's body, hand-over-hand, panting: (') Who do you work for
The other man is panting much harder: Tuchman Marsh
This stops Harry
He isn't sure what he's heard
What
Tuchman Marsh
Tuchman Marsh
Yes
Your name is
Tuchman Marsh
Tuchman Marsh Hauptman Rodino
93
Harry stares at the man underneath him
The gasping man explains: (') work for them
You
work for Tuchman Marsh
Yes
Which is a law firm
No
rock band
Yes, it's a law firm
Well
why are you following me
Divorce action, numbnuts
Harry is blindsided
He stares
He slowly sits up, digesting: My
my wife hired you
The freed Tuchman Marsh man also sits up, still panting heavily
No
Your wife hired Tuchman Marsh
Tuchman Marsh hired me
work for Tuchman Marsh
You're----you're----a divorce detective
Not just
Credit, missing persons, whatever
But this is divorce
("duh") Well
yeah
94
Harry rises and walks stiffly, zombie-like, up the street
The man watches him go
After a few paces Harry stops and sits on the curb
He starts weeping
The man, still breathing heavily, calls out: (') Jesus----grow up, man
It happens to everybody
Harry's cell phone chirps
He fishes it out and unfolds it, sniveling
Yeah
Harry, it's Osbourne Cox
Harry stares, trying to fit this in
Osbourne prompts, after a silent beat: (') Harry
Yeah
Harry, could  get your wife's number
This is Osbourne Cox, could  trouble you for your wife's---- You can't tell her anything she doesn't already know, fucker
What
Harry again stares: maybe he has this figured wrong
After a silence: (') Is this
Harry Pfarrer
You want

Filtered rings, then a connection: ' Hello

Hi
Hi
Hi
Sorry to call out of the blue but have a, well, a publishing question and  thought you might be the person to ask,  have this manuscript, something to do with my professional experiences, not to go into too much detail but  think it's pretty explosive stuff and  think that it could merit a fairly wide readership handled properly and it isn't quite finished yet but there's a situation where 'm worried about it leaking now and maybe excerpts being published or on the internet, whatever, without my permission, and a lot of the impact being, um, blunted, so 'm actually anxious to bring it to market sooner than 'd planned---- mean, like now, in fact----so  was thinking,  know you, and you seem to do well, so  was wondering if you were happy with your publisher
The people you use
long beat
96
You've written a children's book
No
No no, a, a kind of a memoir, but ----doesn't your company have an adult arm
Or isn't it, uh, the children's arm
Of a regular publisher
Pappas & Swain do children's literature
Uh-huh

So they don't---- okay
Are you well
Very well thank you

Yes

An urgent matter
Well this could be urgent too, since, you know, Chad has been missing for forty-eight hours now and---- don't know the whereabouts of Chad, madam

Krapotkin fishes something from his pocket
Would you like your disk back

We hear two pairs of footsteps
They approach for several beats and then Linda and her escort enter frame and recede, footsteps echoing
The staffer's hand is on Linda's elbow
As we hold on their backs and they continue to walk, Linda jerks her arm away; the staffer regrabs it
She jerks away again

He brings the notice close, squints at it

Let me scrub this crap off my face

-                                141 Osbourne opens a cabinet, muttering: Just for starters
He takes out liquor bottles and starts putting them in a packing case on the kitchen counter
142
-                                      142 People sit on benches eating lunches
Harry Pfarrer is on the bench where he and Linda met, once again spitting sunflower seeds
Linda walks up
They greet each other with a kiss
Hello there sunshine
You look great
Well you seem better
Harry does indeed seem more like his old self
Yeah,  snuck in a little gym time this morning
And our exercise last night didn't hurt
Linda is shocked but secretly pleased: Harry
109
Boy,  am through banging my head against the wall
am gonna start doing what's right for me
That's how  believe, also
You have to do what's right for---- Yeah
Hell yeah
mean  had a shock recently, and  realized you know, life is not infinite
No one's immortal
No one's immortal
You have to get from each day its full, uh, squeeze the juice from every day because there but for the grace of God---- Exactly
The important thing is to maintain a positive outlook
Always up
Always ebullient
That's right, don't sweat the small stuff
Linda chimes in: Linda and Harry (') and it's all small stuff
Harry reaches for Linda and she slides closer
He puts an arm around her
(') This is where we first met
Remember
Of course  do
You never know what the important days are, until
until, um
110
The thought drifts away as his gaze fixes on something
With his look still fixed: (') told myself  was gonna stop being paranoid, but
is that guy looking at us
Linda follows his look
On a bench a short distance away a middle-aged man with aviator glasses and hair plugs is staring at them
(hastily) No, no
slightly overweight woman stops tentatively in front of the man in the aviator glasses and they start to talk
Linda turns to Harry
(') Have you found out anything about Chad
Nothing yet, 've made a couple calls
don't think it'll take long
Really
Oh yeah, there are so many data bases now it's a joke
Relaxing now that he sees the man in aviator glasses engaged in conversation, Harry warms to his theme
(') Back when  was in  there was still some art to finding people
Not any more
And now with the cell phones
Pretty soon they're gonna know where everyone is
Everyone
At any given moment
mean it's almost the reality now
You would be amazed
Uh-huh
111
Did he----when you left the Jamba Juice ----did Chad say anything about where he might be going
Oh,  know where he was going
Oh yeah
residence in Alexandria
On Hillsboro Drive
Harry has stopped chewing
He is staring at her
Linda feels obliged to fill the silence
(') 2055 Hillsboro
Harry stares
Linda doesn't know what to make of his fixed stare
(') It's, um
The residence of a guy named Osbourne Cox
Harry is beginning to look sick
long silence
Then, quietly: Who are you
Now Linda stares, unsure of what to make of the question
(') Linda's eyes widen
She is a little frightened
People nearby turn to look
It is a scene
(') Harry reaches up
He grabs her by the shoulders and shakes
(') 112
Linda is at sea
She answers in a small voice: 'm
just
Linda Litzke
Harry stares at her
long beat
He leaps to his feet and looks around in a panic
His point-of-view, sweeping the park
Nearby, the man with plugs, though talking with his date, is looking at him again
Farther away, a man sits in a curbside sedan
Watching
Hard to say
Harry turns and runs
Linda gapes
(') Harry

-   -                             143 Osbourne sets the packing box heavily      down on a bureau in the upstairs bedroom
The box is a third       loaded up with liquor bottles
It also holds a mixed drink       which Osbourne now takes out
The ice cubes clink as he       sips, poking through things in the bureau
One drawer holds scarves and accessories and a large case
He opens the case and starts dumping jewelry from it into the cardboard box
Suddenly: Ow
Fuck
He yanks his hand back and shakes it
He looks at the ball of his thumb
He sucks it
He carefully picks a brooch out of the jewelry case and flings it across the room
He resumes dumping jewelry into his box
He suddenly stops: faint knock
The front door
Osbourne waits
The knock repeats
113
Another beat
The front door creaks open
Osbourne carefully sets down his drink
He steps quietly to the closet and pulls a small cedar chest off a high shelf
144

'  -                       144 Linda flings open the door to her car parked on the street bordering the mall
She gets in and turns the ignition
Pulling into traffic she checks her rear-view, and her look snags on: dark four-door sedan pulling out a few cars back
It falls in behind her
Its driver is a man in sunglasses
He reaches up and touches fingertips to one ear
Linda frowns
She looks forward, glances again at the mirror
Another dark car pulls into the lane next to the first
Its driver is also a man in sunglasses
145
-   -                            145 Downstairs, Osbourne rounds the corner from entryway to living room, a handgun at the ready
His drink is in his other hand
Ice cubes clink as he moves
The living room is empty
Osbourne advances cautiously
quick sidelong look at the kitchen
Empty
He proceeds to the basement door
146
' /
-                          146 She gives worried glances at her rear-view
The light ahead turns yellow, red
Cars ahead stop
Linda stops
rhythmic thudding sound
It almost makes her car vibrate
114
She looks around
She rolls down her window, sticks her head out, looks up
black helicopter hovers overhead, rotors thudding
black- clad body leans partway out
The person seems to be looking down
Linda draws her head back in
Oh for Pete's sake
147
-                                     147 Osbourne is slowly descending the stairs, gun and drink in either hand, gun up, ice cubes clinking
The basement comes slowly into view
Someone stands behind his desk, at the computer
Osbourne descends further
He stops on the bottom step and stares at Ted Treffon, the soulful manager of Hardbodies
Ted stares at him
long silence between the two men
Then, quietly: And you are
my wife's lover
No
Then what are you doing here
Silence
Osbourne takes the last step down
He advances slowly, gun trained on Ted
Osbourne's look, holding on Ted, changes
(') know you
You're the guy at the gym
Ted licks his lips
'm not here representing Hardbodies
115
know what you represent
You represent the idiocy of today
Ted shakes his head
don't represent that, either
Oh yes
You're the guy when  went to ask about that moronic woman
She's not---- You're in league with that moronic woman
You're part of a league of morons
No
Yes
You're one of the morons 've been fighting all my life
My whole fucking life
But guess what
Guess what
Today  win
Ah
Ted is shot in the upper chest
He grabs a three-hole punch from the desktop and flings it at Osbourne and charges
Oh
----another shot goes off
Ted barrels into Osbourne, knocking him over---- (') Oooph
----and goes on past him, lumbering up the stairs
Osbourne gets to his feet
Pink Revision 8/14/07 116
(') Stop
Intruder
148
-                                            148 Ted staggers out of the house, a hand pressed to his chest
He has reached the front lawn when Osbourne emerges, robe flapping, pursuing with the hatchet
Intruder
He quickly catches up to Ted and whacks at him
Oh
Osbourne whacks him down
He keeps whacking at him
149
'  -                                           149 Gardner Chubb is behind his desk
Wait
Palmer DeBakey Smith is seated across from him
He freezes
beat
Gardner Chubb rubs his forehead
(') Wait a minute
Where's the treasury guy
Pfarrer
Right now
Right now
In a detention room at Washington Dulles
* Why
He was trying to board a flight to Venezuela
() 117
(') We had his name on a hot list, the pulled him
Don't know why he was going to Venezuela
You don't know
No sir
We have no extradition with Venezuela
Oh
Uh-huh
Well----what should we do with him
For fuck's sake, put him on the next flight to Venezuela
Yes sir
Okay
Gardner Chubb is weary
Okay
So the gym manager is dead
Yes sir
The body is---- Gone, sir
Okay---- But----there was a, uh
snag
What
Well
This analyst, Cox, was attacking the gym guy
It was broad daylight, on the street
Our man there didn't know what to do
He felt he had to step in
118
Yes
He, uh
He shot the analyst
He shot Cox
Good
Great
Is he dead
No sir
Gardner Chubb grimaces
(') He's in coma
They're not sure whether he'll make it
They think, they're pretty sure he has no brain function
Okay
Okay
If he wakes up we'll worry about it then
Jesus, what a clusterfuck
That's it then
No one else really knows anything
Okay
Um
Well sir, there is
What
Um
What
There is the woman
The gym woman
Linda Litzke
Oh yeah
Fuck
Where is she
We picked her up
We have her
Can we, uh---- 119
She, she, she says she'll play ball if we pay for some
know this sounds odd----some surgeries she wants
Cosmetic surgery
She says she'll sit on everything
How much
There were several procedures
All together they run to, um---- Pay it
Yes sir
Should  pay it out of, should it be from---- One of the black accounts,  don't give a shit
The January fund
Whatever
Okay
Jesus
Jesus fucking Christ
He shakes his head
(') What did we learn, Palmer
don't know, sir
don't fucking know either
guess we learned not to do it again
Yes sir
Although 'm fucked if  know what we did
Yes sir
Hard to say
120
We pull back from Gardner Chubb, shaking his head
Jesus
Jesus fucking Christ
150
-  -                         150 We pull up, back through the clouds, away
