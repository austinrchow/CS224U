Wallace William Kelley Pamela Wallace , The faces of several young children are presented in , as they walk   across a ploughed field
On the , the haunting
The to the faces of older brothers and sisters, then to parents and grandparents
These are not familiar faces, but faces from another age, strong and open
All are dressed in the distinctive clothing of the Amish
Through the last traces of early morning mist another group of black-clad figures make their way down a lane
An Amish buggy, black and highwheeled, stark against the landscape, appears, a spirited chestnut in the traces
Framed in the glass window of the narrow buggy is the stern figure of an Amish man in black topcoat and flatbrimmed hat, his bonneted wife in muted colors, the face of a boy, attired like his father, peering out
The horse's breath smokes on the frosty air, the buggy on its springs, and there's the rhythmic - on the pavement
Two Amish buggies reach a crossroads, join a procession of three others
They disappear as the lane wends through a leafless thicket of hickory
now the procession numbers almost a dozen buggies
it is headed toward a distant farmhouse
Where literally dozens of carriages are parked
The horses have been taken from the traces, removed to the shelter of the barn
As the black clad mourners begin to move into the house (women and children presumably first)
The coffin has the upper half open
We see that the corpse has been dressed in white linen, a piece of white linen partially covering the bearded face
Partitions have been removed, making the central rooms of the farmhouse a spacious hall
The place is packed, a hundred- fifty or more Amish, all sitting in absolute silence on rows of wooden benches
wooden coffin rests on a bench in the f
g
, and near it the close relatives of the deceased occupy a special Place
young woman of perhaps twenty-seven
Her face is pale and drawn
In happier circumstances, although there haven't been too many of late in Rachel's life, we would see a robust, sensual woman of full figure, spirit and intelligence
Eight-year-old   flits next to his mother; he would appear stunned, possibly not entirely comprehending events
And the patriarch,  ; his stubborn, weathered  yet not unkind  features grief-stricken
Their faces
As it begins to  nine a
m
As he removes his hat
As one, the men in the congregation remove their hats also
Then the preacher begins to speak in a formal German dialect: a brother has been called home
God has spoken through the death of our neighbor, Jacob Lapp
Where Rachel, Samuel and Eli are  -  of emotion and grief not quite suppressed are heard throughout as: husband of Rachel, father to Samuel, son of Eli
(and) His chair is empty, his bed is empty, his voice will be heard no more
He was needed in our presence, but God needs such men, too
That one should be taken so suddenly
Treat sorrow
Still, we would not wish him back
Rather we should prepare ourselves to follow him
to the Lapps, and
The mourners have gathered about the grave, standing in silence as four pallbearers are lowering the coffin into the pit
The many buggies are aligned in the b
g
As the pallbearers begin to shovel soil and gravel into the grave, the Preacher begins to read a hymn in German
a slow atonal litany which seems to hang forever on the frosty air
to her as the hymn continues
: Where the Amish have gathered for the traditional post funeral, midday meals
Long tables are laden with customary Amishfare
crocks of soup, hams, fowl, fried boiled eggs and pickled beets, preserves and an infinite variety of pies and pastries
Where she sits among women, accepting their condolences
brawny-armed, ruggedly-handsome, raffish looking Amishman
There is something atypical about his face a slightly sardonic set of mouth, a bold eye, a prominent set of jaw
Not exactly what old Jacob Ammann had in mind, maybe, but a well set-up man nonetheless, and at ease among men
He's among a group of men including old , the local healer, , and Bieiler's stout young son, Tom
Lapp was a good farmer
None better
But not the man to buy a horse for you
(and) Hochstetler, wasn't it your father sold him that horse with a ruptured testicle
(grins) Told him it was a bee sting made him limp that way
(amused) That horse had one good ball
That's all it takes
The others chuckle
But Hochstetler's attention is still on Rachel
As Hochstetler looms on the horizon, plants himself like a tree in front of her
At ease as he was with the men, he's a bit awkward at this
All the women, very much aware of Hochstetler's availability, tune in as Rachel looks up
was sorry to hear about Jacob
Let us hope he walks close with God
'm sure he does, Daniel
, It is some time after the funeral and the Lapp family is hard at work breaking ground for the spring ploughing
The death of Jacob has increased the work load on all three Samuel maneuvers a four-mule team while Rachel and old Eli work nearby, further breaking up the earth
Rachel looks up from the back-breaking labor as several figures approach it's Daniel Hochstetler and two of his brothers
Without a word they fall in beside Eli and Rachel and take up various tasks associated with the work in hand
Daniel works close beside Rachel
, few   of a lone buggy containing the Lapp family take us from the 18th century into the 20th century the reassuring      on quiet backroad, to the    as the buggy waits patiently for a chance to cross a busy interstate highway
, huge tractor trailer rig hovers over the frail buggy as it trots down the interstate
The camera cranes up to reveal a procession of vehicles behind the truck for a chance to overtake it
, Daniel Hochstetler moves through the crowd on the plat-form, Rachel turns surprised, as he approaches, a faint color coming to her cheek
Daniel
was at the feed store
And saw your horse, so
There is an embarrassment between them broken by the arrival of the train
You will come back soon
Samuel can barely contain his excitement as he drags at his mother's hand
Quickly, Mother Quickly
Rachel embraces Eli
You be careful out among them English
She turns to Hochstetler
need time, Daniel
, Daniel Hochstetler leaps into the driving seat of his open wagon and with a flick of the reins and a whoop sets his horse off at a fast trot
The  gives a   before creeping slowly forward
() As Samuel spots something out of the window that causes him to light up
Look, Mama
road runs parallel to the train track, and Hochstetler in his wagon urges his horse almost to the gallop as he attempts to keep pace with the train
As Rachel smiles
see, darling
And Samuel cranes to look back, waving, for as long as he can
The train moves across a broad panorama of fields, dotted with dolls'-house-sized farms and the tiny figures of Amish farmers working their horse-drawn equipment
As the train continues its eastward journey
Samuel stares raptly out of the window at the changing patterns of the countryside
He points in wonder at a brightly colored hot air balloon as it drifts slowly over timbered hills
he looks unsure as the pattern of field and wood gives way to suburbs, bustling shopping centers, restaurants, car lots and fast food outlets
As the train travels past dilapidated row houses, streets choked with cars and the gutters with filth
() Now Samuel is staring out the window with some confusion, almost apprehension: Is this where we're going
Of course not
We're going to Baltimore
It's much nicer in Baltimore
And Rachel draws her son closer, turning her back on the window
30TH
, Rachel is in a line at one of the counters
The plain dress of the two Amish  particularly Samuel's black coat and hat are drawing curious stares
He's uncomfortably aware of the shy looks and giggles of a little girl about his own age, standing in line with her parents at the next counter
He edges away from his mother
As Samuel comes upon a figure garbed in a long black frock coat and flat-brimmed hat
the man's back is turned, could, from appearances, be an Amishman
Samuel stares
beat, the man turns to face Samuel and we discover that he is a Hasidic Jew
As he reacts
As Rachel's turn arrives
The   glances up and she shows him her ticket
We have a ticket to Baltimore
Where is that train, please
Delayed three hours
You'll hear an announcement when it's time to board
He starts to go without his hat, but Rachel collars him and puts it on his head
' As Samuel enters
It's a long row of sinks, urinals, and stalls
Samuel stops before one of the urinals  a long, trough-like affair with water drizzling down the rear porcelain panel
It's set a little high for Samuel, and it is making that are, at least, intimidating
Samuel stares for a moment, then turns, looks toward the stalls, stoops to see which are empty
Beneath the row of doors we can see no feet visible
Samuel is alone in the restroom
As Samuel proceeds along the row of door, finally selects a stall near the end
He enters
As he does so, a heavily bearded youth in a dirty sweatshirt enters
With some urgency, he removes small notebook from his pocket and places it behind a paper towel dispenser
Suddenly he glances up
Two other men have entered the men's room; one is a large in a three-piece suit under an expensive, overcoat
His  is a Caucasian in designer jeans, half boots and a short leather jacket
They advance on the young man with unmistakable menace
The young man whirls in terror; his two assailants lunge for him
a savage, wordless struggle ensues in the close confines of the lavatory
' As the struggling men bounce off the door of his stall
he can see their feet under the edge of the door
As the struggle builds to a climax
ends with the young man stiffening with a grunt, his face draining of color
The two attackers step away, the blade in the black man's hand bloodstained
His partner stares at what they've accomplished with a stunned expression: Jesus
The young man's hand comes away from his belly covered with blood
He stares at it, staggers toward the sinks
Finally his bloodied hand reaches to smear at his face in the mirror
Then he collapses to the floor
The black man motions for his partner to watch the door, then quickly reaches up and removes the notebook from behind the dispenser
' As he edges open the stall door a crack
Over his shoulder we can see the black man, his   , rifling the backpack
But beyond him, in the mirror on the far wall, we catch sight of the black man's face
As he stares out the narrow crack
beat, then he closes the stall door
Samuel tries to make the latch work, but it's warped and won't fall closed
As he checks the notebook before placing it in his pocket
His partner is covering the door, an automatic in his hand
The black man makes for the exit, then on second thought, glances at the row of stalls
All quiet, but
The black man whips out a
38 caliber revolver, and, starting at the near end, starts pushing open the stall doors
' As the black man approaches, Samuel working desperately on the latch
At the last minute he finally wedges it in
He elbows Samuel's stall
the door won't open
' Fighting back panic, Samuel has retreated as far as he can
As he gives the door a kick
It holds
He swears under his breath
' In desperation, Samuel does the only thing he can think of
he slips under the partition into the neighboring stall the black man just checked out
But he loses his hat in the process
His hand snakes back   to snatch it just as the black man gives the door a ferocious kick that splinters the lock and nearly takes it off its hinges
He's framed there, the big muzzle of the
38 revolver looking down our throats
As his partner snaps from the doorway: Will you come on, for Christ's sakes
beat, then the black man holsters his weapon, turns to follow the partner out
As we hear the       the lavatory long beat, then Samuel opens the stall door a crack
Samuel's own face reflected in the blood-smeared mirror
then   to the still figure of the young man lying in the crimson pool of his own blood on the floor
Samuel sits close to his mother, his face pale, his eyes staring
Rachel holds his hand tightly in hers as the torsos of various police and officials pass through foreground, occasionally obscuring the lonely couple
There is considerable as commands and requests mingle with the -
: '' The diffused shape of faces behind the frosted glass of the Men's room door, which is pushed open to reveal,  , who comes striding through to be momentarily lost in the crowd of police, reporters and others
He is about 40, with a rangy, athletic body
Behind him comes , Book's black partner  about five years younger than Book
Book is wearing a suit, Carter is much more casually  almost disreputably dressed
: Little Samuel watching Book, back to crowd of police, as Book questions an old black
You found the body
Uh uh
Not me, daddy,  just reported it
It was the kid
What kid
How'n hell do  know what kid
The kid in the funny black threads
Worry-eyed, still staring straight ahead
Then his eyes move suddenly to his left
'   ' Coming in at full stride, then stopping
He doesn't raise his eyes
just looks at the legs
And, slowly, the legs begin to bend at the knees
We see Book's belt buckle, then his big pistol in its holster, then his face
He stares at Samuel for a moment, then
As his face breaks into a big grin, and
Hi, kid
Immediately alarmed, intervening
What do you want of my son
As Book takes out his wallet, displays his shield
'm a police officer
'm going to have to talk to the boy
What's his name
Samuel
Samuel Lapp
(then, quickly) But what happened here is none of his affair
My sister is expecting me
our train is leaving soon
There'll be another train
(turns to Samuel) The man who was killed tonight was a policeman, Sam
It's my job to find out who did it
want you to tell me everything you saw when you went in there
(stammers) saw him
Who'd you see
Sam looks at his mother
Who'd you see, Sam
The man on the floor
No
saw the man who killed him
Book stares at him in surprise, speaks over his shoulder to Carter
Anybody know about this
didn't even know about it
(back to Sam) Okay, Sam
Can you tell me what he looked like
(groping, touching his clothes and pointing at Carter) He was
like him
(nods) Black
understand
What else,Sam
beat, then Sam crosses quickly to Carter, Book's rather slightly built partner: Not Zwartich, like him Book frowns, puzzled: Try that one again, Sam Samuel gives his mother a helpless look; exasperated, Rachel intervenes with Book
She glances at Carter: May  talk to you
As Rachel takes Book aside, and in a low voice: Zwartich
It's the way we say
dwarf
(glances at Carter) Not like him
very big
Book nods, starts to turn back to Sam
Just then a commotion off screen catches his attention
' It's Capt
, Chief of Homicide, striding past the crowd of journalists and  crews
brushing off reporters' questions and snapping orders to the aides he's got in tow: : (to aides) Close it all down
want a man on every exit
want the lab in here now
(to Book) And  want to talk to you, Captain
As Book steps aside with Donahue
In the b
g
Rachel moves protectively to Samuel's side
All right, talk
This is homicide  not Internal Affairs
So why are you behaving like you own this case
We were running Zenovitch
That's all  can tell you
But  want it, Terry
(then) 've got a call into Schaeffer
/ They can't help but watch the confrontation between Donahue and Book
although they're keeping the volume down, it's obviously intense and angry: (alarmed) Momma
are they angry with us
(reassuring, but hardly in her own mind) No
No
It is just the English way
Donahue has lost the confrontation; he gives Book a smile: You ought to think about coming back to Homicide, Johnny
Stick with Internal Affairs and you're not gonna have any friends left
(smiles right back) 'll buy a dog
30TH Book emerges from the terminal, looks about him, then crosses to a big Mercury Sedan which is parked nearby
Two men sit in the front seat
Book crosses to the driver's side and opens the door
Go get a cup of coffee, Stan
The driver, a uniformed policeman, glances at the man beside him who nods in agreement
He gets out and Book gets in behind the wheel
Book sits next to , a surprisingly kindly looking man of about fifty
Schaeffer is a Deputy Chief
How reliable is this kid
Oh, he's good
Amish
Yeah
What have you got
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight  street chemists
the guys processing this P2P into speed
So one of them got to him
Maybe
You know who
Maybe
You're still convinced there's a link to the department
If there isn't 've just wasted the last six months
That's the problem
We need results
The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing
Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'
You know the sort of thing
It's getting political
The Commissioner's getting very uneasy
The Amish boy saw him, Paul
'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing
When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose
You've got 24 hours
That's all can give you
24 hours on your own
After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department
(shakes his head) Tell you what
why don't you and that blonde  what's-her-name  come over for dinner Sunday
How 'bout that
What's-her-name moved to Buffalo
(sighs) Well, anyway, don't get crazy
(dismisses him) 'll do something for Zenovich's wife
'  () Book drives around 13th Street, a ravaged corridor between neon lit restaurants, bars, porno shops and darkened storefronts
Carter sits beside him, Rachel and her son in the back seat looking out at the assorted array of desperate characters huddled in doorways or wandering aimlessly about
On the a description of the cop killing is got there late, John
Let's just find Coalmine
(beat) Listen, Zenovich made a mistake
You didn't let anybody down
It happens (grimly) It won't happen again
Where are you taking us
We're looking for a suspect
We've reason to believe he's still in the area
You have no right to keep us here
Yes  do
Your son is a material witness to a homicide
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws
Doesn't surprise me
meet a lot of people like that
It's not a joke
Book decides to try contrition: You're right
It's not a joke
Listen, know a little about the Amish know this has to be an ordeal for you; and 'm really sorry you an Samuel got involved
Samuel shoots a look at Book then mutters something to his mother in German
She responds in the same language
Book frowns
What was that
He wants to know who you are
Your name
told him we don't need to know anything about you
Book eyes Samuel: Book
John Book 13TH Book's car stops, and from out of the shadows darts a wizened little
He looks about before crossing to the driver's side window
' Book lowers the window
Sammy, where's Coalmine
The little man stares at the weird-looking couple in the back seat
What you got there, the Salvation Army
Coalmine
Try "Happy Valley"
, Book's car pulls up outside the bar and he and Carter get out, and move swiftly inside
Sixty black faces stare as the police enter
hush falls on the group
Book and Carter spot their man at the bar and move up either side of him
They've moved carefully to this point
no mistakes
From the back, the black man they've approached certainly looks like he could be the man who did the killing of Zenovitch
And, as Book and Carter make their move
As Book and Carter explode through the door of the bar, violently propelling Coalmine along with them
Now we see Coalmine is not the killer
As Book and Carter escort Coalmine out of the bar a police squad car pulls up, its headlights shining into Book's car
An alarmed Rachel holds Samuel close as Book forces Coalmine's face down next to the car window
Put some light on him
cop pulls out a flashlight, begins to play the beam over Coalmine's face
(continuing; to Samuel) Look at him
Crazy as Rasputin on speed and booze, Coalmine glares at Samuel inside the car: Samuel, white-faced, finally shakes his head in the negative
Coalmine tries to twist free of Book's grip
Book snaps, and slams Coalmine's skull into the window edge, finally crushing his face up against the front window
His face takes on a grotesque shape against the glass
Carter restrains his partner and Book cools down
Coalmine is led stumbling away by the uniformed police
This sudden show of violence has horrified and angered Rachel, and she glares at Book as he gets back in the car
John Book, you listen to me
will have no further part in this, nor will my son
As God stands between us
Book sighs, starts the engine and moves off
Book pulls up outside a hotel entrance as a uniformed moves to open the rear door
Rachel and Sam recoil as the Doorman opens the door
He is puzzled by the sight of the reluctant guests
Ma'am
No
We do not stay in hotels
Book and Carter exchange a glance
/
, An attractive woman in her early thirties in robe and slippers stares in disbelief as Rachel and Sam file into the house
This is , Book's sister
She stops Book as he tries to follow Rachel inside
How could you do this to me tonight
told you  had company Sorry
It's important
As she glances in a doorway
' It's a shambles, with dirty supper dishes piled sink, the table littered with empty beer cans
As she hustles Samuel along
/ Book frowns: Where's Timmy and Buck
Upstairs, asleep
Where'd you think
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs
That's none of your goddamn business
So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut
(and) Anyway, they like Fred
Oh sure, Fred
Elaine looks like she's going to blow again, then decides it's pointless
Who are these orphans, anyway
They're Amish
Samuel is asleep in one twin bed in a tiny, cluttered room
Rachel, in a plain nightgown, is preparing to climb into the other one
Off screen we hear a  , presumably Book leaving beat, then Elaine opens the door and looks in
Everything okay
Yes, thank you very much
(a beat) John said you're Amish
Yes
(blankly) Oh
She nods and goes
Rachel crosses to Samuel, sits on the bed
Samuel looks up at her bleakly
don't want to stay here
They are English
They don't understand
wish dawdie was with us
(swallows) know
Sleep now, Liebchen
She puts her hand on his forehead, closes his eyes
she frowns, and
- - Carter exits the cafe carrying burgers, donuts and a couple of beers
Book wakes from a brief nap as Carter gets into the car
Book chews into his burger while Carter takes a doughnut
Its clear they've worked through the night
' Elaine's house is situated on the corner of a row of terraces, which stretch into the distance on both sides of the street
' As Samuel comes out of the guest room in his night-shirt, turns up the hall and opens the door to the bathroom
But it's not the bathroom; it's Elaine's bedroom
She and are tangled in the sheets, furiously making love
Elaine gasps, Fred manages to grunt
Wrong door, kid
As Samuel quickly shuts the door
straight-faced beat; then, barely suppressing a giggle, he hurries on
As Rachel appears in the living room entry
Samuel is sitting on the floor with two boys of about his own age, watching television
They're eating cold cereal out of a box
' Some artless Saturday morning cartoon
As she frowns, watching her son and the other two staring hypnotically
And
It's later in the morning now, as Elaine, a bit blearily, appears in the entryway, stares in groggy disbelief
Her oldest boy and Samuel are busily washing the windows while her youngest is pushing a carpet sweeper
The  is off
As she stares
Rachel is standing in the middle of the now immaculate kitchen finishing a brisk mop of the floor
The coffee is perking
Elaine appears
(mutters) Jesus
Rachel turns cheerily
Good morning
(helplessly) You didn't have to
wanted to
you were kind to take us in last night
(and) Anyway,  needed something to do was so angry with your brother
He's so
agaanisish
Aganishish
Yeah, that sounds like John
She takes a seat at the table, still shaking her head
Just a minute
'll pour you some coffee
You're not carrying a bullwhip
how'd you manage to put my kids to work
(smiles) made it a contest
the one who does best gets his cereal back first
(and) Children like to help
they only need to be kept after a little bit
Rachel means no harm by this, but Elaine's eyes begin to storm
Oh, is that so
(and) No offense, lady, but 'm not so sure  like the idea of your coming in here and turning the place upside down
Rachel's smile fades at Elaine's trembling outburst: Please,  didn't mean
Abruptly Elaine rises and snatches the mop from Rachel's hands
She mops furiously as she Continues: know exactly what you meant
Listen, maybe 'm not a world-class housefrau, but maybe  don't have time to polish the goddamn china and keep after the kids
(and) It's none of your business, but don't happen to have a man around here full time
So  sell cosmetics in a goddamn drugstore and sometimes can even pay the rent on time
So maybe 'm not Mary Poppins, but maybe don't need to have it jammed down my throat like this
She finishes the floor, hurls the mop aside with a : There is that clean enough for you
Rachel is speechless, Elaine is on the point of bursting into tears
At which point Fred appears at the entry in his undershirt, taking in the sparkling kitchen
Jesus, Elaine
Somebody die and leave you a broom
Not a politic observation on Fred's part
(blurts) Go to hell, Fred
And, bursting into tears, she flees the kitchen
Fred stares after her
What's bugging her
Unperturbed, he crosses to the counter and the coffee pot, letting his eyes take in Rachel's full figure
' As Rachel comes in with Elaine's coffee, closes the door behind her
Elaine is lying across the bed, sobbing
brought your coffee
She takes a seat next to the bed
'm sorry
didn't mean it that way
After a moment, Elaine starts to pull herself together: It's okay
(and) Look,  shouldn't have blown my top
It's like
somehow
've let everything get away from me
And you sort of made me face it
She takes the cup, sips the coffee
Rachel smiles at a private thought
What's so funny
Fred
The way he looked when you screamed at him
(disparing) God, Fred
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way
No
Why not
You just wouldn't
It's not the Amish way
(then) But  think it would have done me good if  could have screamed at your brother last night
Listen,  don't know what's going on or how you got mixed up with him, but don't you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around, okay
Rachel smiles
Okay
'  () Book glances irritably at Rachel: Now what's the problem
The problem is  don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people
Book gives her a look: Whacking
(firmly) Yes
And  also want to leave this city
Believe me, 'm trying to get this over with as fast as  can
But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify
We do not go into your courts
People who don't go into our courts when they're told to sometimes go directly into our jail
Rachel glares at him and the ride continues on that chilly note for a beat
Look, 'm genuinely sorry
(snaps) No you're not (off his look) You're glad, because now you've got a witness
(and) heard the other police talking last night
(and) They don't seem to like you very much
They kid a lot
(glances at him) would not be too sure
Samuel has been glancing at Book; finally he says something to his mother in German
Book gives her an inquiring look
He says you look very tired
thought the same thing
Book says nothing
But not a good tired
What's a 'good' tired
Tired is tired
She doesn't bother to explain; Book settles even deeper into his funk as Samuel glares at him with hostility
Samuel sits with Book at a desk, Rachel just behind
They are looking at a police line-up of known black drug-dealers
Samuel shakes his head  another negative
Book winks, slyly reaches into a pocket, produces a yellow gumball
He surreptitiously shows it to Samuel, gives him an inquiring look
It's a peace offering
Samuel grins, nods imperceptibly
As Book rolls the gumball down the table to Samuel
But just as Samuel is about to cover it with his hand, Rachel reaches over and plucks it off the table
She shakes her head at Samuel
(to Rachel) Just wanted to see if you were on your toes
Book, Sam and Rachel sit on a park bench eating a lunch of hot dogs heaped with kraut
Book watches with amusement as Samuel wolfs down his lunch
Rachel eyes him a beat
then: Your sister said you don't have a family
No
She thinks you should get married and have children of your own
Instead of trying to be a father to hers
Except she thinks you're afraid of the responsibility
Book gives her a look: Oh
Anything else
Oh yes
She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything
And you're the only one who can do anything
And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a
um
bag of elbows
Book is staring at her
Rachel nods
think that's what she said
Just then Samuel belches with huge satisfaction, drawing looks from Book and a couple of passersby
Rachel smiles proudly
Good appetite
: / , Rachel sits uneasily in the outer office, one or two police clerks eyeing her curiously
sign on the desk reads "Narcotics Division
" Rachel cranes forward trying to peer through a partially open door
,  , group of Narcotics Detectives are interrupted in mid conversation by the opening of the main office door
They stare in considerable surprise
: Standing in the doorway, holding little Samuel by the hand
Afternoon, gentlemen
'd like you to meet Samuel Lapp
We'd like a little help
, Narcotics Detective enters the room laden with several volumes of mug shots
He puts them on the desk beside a similar book which Samuel is intently studying
Sam sits on the chair cushions in a big swivel rocker
The Detective,
, eyes Book a little suspiciously internal affairs officers are not greeted warmly by the working policemen in any department
There's a Sgt
Carter on the phone for you
Book gets up and moves to the door
And, Captain, don't want to rush you, but 'm gonna need these files back in a half hour
We got a lot of work to do round here
The two men leave
Samuel looks about before hopping off his perch and following the direction taken by Book
, Through glass partitions we can see Book on the telephone in a cubicle of an office
Samuel has drifted out of the office and is idling amid the bustle of the squadroom
He crosses to a glass case which holds a collection of plaques and framed newspaper accounts which denote instances of outstanding duty and achievement
As Samuel moves along, only half interested in what his eyes are taking in, not really old enough to comprehend anyway
Until suddenly he freezes
' Enlarged, prominently displayed
The headline reads: "Division Chief McElroy Honored For Youth Project"
Accompanying the item is a large sidebar mug-shot of McElroy  clearly the black man who murdered the young cop in the train station men's room
He stares, transfixed
long beat, then Book, lowering himself to one knee next to Samuel,
He's watching Samuel, knowing from the boy's expression that they've found their man
Samuel slowly raises his hand to point at the photograph
Book gently takes the boy's small hand in his, concealing the accusation from watchful eyes
He smiles gently at the boy
'  () Rachel is curled tight in her corner of the front seat holding Samuel close
Book glances at her: Why don't you arrest that man
Are you protecting him because policeman
(snaps) Listen, 'm the cop that polices the police
'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops
(eases up) 'll make an arrest when  know everybody involved
Rachel shakes her head
But why would they murder
Because  somehow  they knew  was getting close
(and) Look, it's narcotics
They make dope out of chemicals
they sell it on the street for millions of dollars
They'll do anything
(and) And they can get away with it because they're cops
(beat, then) 'm afraid
'm afraid for Samuel want to go home
You'll be safe
You don't have to worry
She says nothing
Another beat, then: Look, they're thinking as long as they keep the killer out of Samuel's way, we can't make an
There's no way they can know Samuel saw that photograph, so he's safe
He glances at her, but she continues ahead
mean it
You will be safe
Suddenly Rachel explodes: Oh yes
Of Course
Why shouldn't we feel safe in a city where the police are so busy killing each other

, The front door of Schaeffer's upper-middle class home is opened by his wife
She knows Book and is surprised and delighted to see him
In the background daughter is visible
Schaeffer himself appears and Book is welcomed inside
' Schaeffer passes Book a drink
Book is excited, animated
the hunter, after a long chase, closing on his quarry: It was McElroy, Paul
Schaeffer gives him a sharp look: Last guy  would have figured
But he's part of it
hope you don't have any doubts about that
If  did, 'd have kept my mouth shut
(and) It fits, Paul
Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago
Guess who was in on the collar
Mac
(excited, explaining the thing eagerly) He salts it away somewhere
he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it
But they do now
(and) And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum
(beat) Who else knows
Just us
(shakes his head) Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up More people
Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off
People from outside the department
(nods) Maybe the Bureau
Or those bastards at Treasury
'll take care of it
(then) hate this shit, Johnny
You cut their balls off for me
'm counting on you
Schaeffer pours himself another drink
What's your first move
(expels a breath) hot shower
haven't changed clothes in two days
Book slams the front door of his car, checks it for being locked, glances at a roiled newspaper in his hand (the sports section of the Inquirer), starts across the parking lot toward his apartment, walking as he keeps glancing down at the sports section
He comes to a sort of crosswalk, stops, reads, starts to take a step
and looks up
McElroy, smiling nicely, starting across toward him from the other side of the parking lot crosswalk Freezing, eyes widening
Utterly surprised and caught
Still smiling, he brings up his right hand out of a shopping bag (which he appeared to be carrying)  letting the shopping bag fall away as he does so  revealing a five-inch barrel Smith and Wesson
357 blue finish revolver with a silencer
Without hesitating, coming right on, still smiling, he once
Already starting to leap away to one side, he is hit, driven into a half-turn
He clutches at the wound, as: Coming right on,  again
the pistol's report a , like the opening of a bottle of cheap champagne
And McElroy still smiling as: Hit
a grazing near-miss this time, but enough to send Book down hard and grasping
Lowering the pistol alongside his leg, as two , barely taking notice of anything, cross with their backs to Book toward McElroy
He smiles at them
Down, muttering
As McElroy walks past Book, drops the pistol to the pavement, keeps on going
and is gone
in pain, beginning to try to crawl crab-like
And we   from the agonized recesses of Book's Dream
(
) Who else knows
(
) Just us
As the lights of an oncoming car  going very slowly, on its way to a parking space  sweep over him and we  it come to a sudden, squealing stop
Book is already trying to get to his feet
now succeeds, lurching into a swaying stance, using an adjacent car for support
we  a car door slam, and footsteps hurrying in our direction, accompanied by excited voices
Book , turns to face the oncomers, fat, middle-aged  has approached to within some feet of Book, looks on edgily: Hey, buddy, what's the score
Little too much to drink
Book stares at him, then looks down at his belly
' As Book removes his hand we can see one of the bullets struck him low in the side, just below the ribcage
the other just above it (but this one inflicting only minor damage)
As the man stares: Goddamn, buddy
You better get to a hospital
(and) Here; 'll give you a hand
He starts to approach, but Book shoves him away
No
No hospital
By now the man's  is hovering at a safe distance: Let him alone, Henry
If he wants to die in the street, that's his business
But the man is not content: Shut up, Romona
Will ya look at that blood
Book has tried to lurch toward his car; the man tries to intercept him: Come on, buddy
you're gonna bleed to death
Book whirls on him, his service revolver in his hand pointed squarely at the fat man's face: Shit
(quavering) told you, Henry
Book doesn't trust himself to speak, but the
38 is sufficiently eloquent for the circumstances, He stares at the fat man another beat, then hesitates, turns, starts back toward his car
As Book's car wheels somewhat erratically through traffic
'  () Book has a gym bag open on the seat next to him, is stuffing a tshirt under his belt to staunch the blood
And
' As he's awakened by the  bedside telephone
He snaps on a lamp
He's instantly awake, not unused to such rousing in the wee hours
woman sleeps beside him
Yeah
He's at an n
d
pay phone
Listen carefully,  wrote the Amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar,  want you to lose it for me, Now
Tonight
What the hell are you talking about
What's happening
Nothing
'm not going to be around for a while
'll call you when can
(alarmed) Johnny, what the fuck
(hard) Listen to me  Schaeffer's part of it
Maybe at the top of it
There's a stunned silence at the other end
Yeah
can put it all together when  get back, 'Til then, you know nothing, understand
Business as usual
(beat) hear you
(nods) Good
Take care of that woman's name for me
And watch your ass
, ' As the door opens and Elaine switches on the light, rousing Rachel
Elaine looks haggard
It's John
He says you have to leave now
He says it's urgent
She leaves the room as Rachel instantly awake, moves quickly to rouse Samuel
Elaine is outside the bathroom listening to instructions from her brother
From inside we hear the Elaine is puzzled but also senses the urgency
(
) Put my car in the garage and close the door
John,  don't understand any of this
(
) (snaps) You don't know anything
borrowed your car
Didn't say why
And you never heard of that woman and her boy
John, why
(shouts) Just do it
Book looks at himself in the mirror, his face is pale and drawn
He examines the wound, a cleanly drilled hole through his right side, just under the rib cage
The wound continues to bleed as he binds a towel tightly about him, before putting his shirt back on
He then carefully wipes away any traces of blood on basin with tissues which he flushes down the toilet
'  () As he drives across town
Samuel is curled up asleep, his head on Rachel's lap
Where are you taking us now
Home
You couldn't wait until morning
Book gives her a look
(insistent) What happened
But Book, glancing in his rearview mirror, tenses
In it we can see a police car coming on fast, with lights and
Rachel eyes Book warily
beat, then the police car  past
Book expels a breath
You said we would be safe in Philadelphia
was wrong
Rachel looks away, speaks almost sarcastically,
Kinner un Narre
["Kinner un Narre saage die Waahret" "Children and fools say the truth" Amish expressions] ' Book's desk calendar
Carter enters in the b
g
, crosses quickly to the desk
He snaps on a light, thumbs a page of the calendar
Frowns
Rachel's name and address scribbled on a page of the calendar
couple of plainclothesmen have paused outside the door to give him a look
Meets their eyes
They move on
Carter shakes it off, goes
And
: () As light colors the eastern horizon, Book is crossing into Lancaster County
Book glances at Rachel; she's asleep
He coughs wrackingly, hurting
cinches the belt of his overcoat even tighter
And
' Coming up the long drive
As the car pulls up in the barnyard and Eli crosses to it
Suddenly the car door flies open and Samuel jumps out, races across the barnyard to hurl himself into the old man
As Rachel steps out of the passenger's side, Book remains seated
He lets his eyes travel around the farm
Stay for awhile
Rest
'll make coffee and breakfast
can't
What about Samuel
Will you come back to take him to trial
Book starts the engine: (grimly) There isn't going to be one
Rachel stares at him, not sure what he means
Then backs away, closing the door
Book begins to turn the car around in the barnyard
As Eli crosses to Rachel, his arm around Samuel
Who was that man
His name is John Book
Eli is about to inquire further when Samuel cries: Momma  look
They glance in the direction Samuel is looking
' The car has failed to take a bend in the road and is now bouncing across an adjoining ploughed field
It's knocked over a tall birdhouse by the roadside
The car finally comes to rest against a bank of earth
She stares
: As Samuel races for all he's worth across the field, negotiates the creek via a fallen log  Rachel, now, also running toward the car
Eli works fast harnessing his mules to an open wagon
He hops up to the front seat and urges them to trot
' We see that Rachel has made Book as comfortable as possible in the front seat of the car and is packing the wound under his trenchcoat with material ripped from her apron
Momentarily he comes awake: But John
why didn't you go to a hospital
No, no doctor
(bewildered) But why
Gunshot
they'll file reports
they'll find me
But Book reaches up to grip her arm fiercely: And when they find me, they'll find your boy
He slips under again
Rachel stares at him, realizing the price he's paid in returning them to safety
She reaches out, touches him gently
But the moment is broken by
As Eli reins up in the springwagon
He climbs down, crosses to glance into the car
Is the English dead
No
Looks dead
And together they begin to lift Book from the car and place him in the back of the springwagon
And
Where Eli is looking out a window
An Amish buggy coming up the drive, past Book' s car
Where Book lies on a bed
Rachel is bathing his wound with warm water from a pan
Eli appears in the doorway
Stoltzfus is coming
Rachel looks at him, nods
Eli frowns at Book's holstered pistol lying atop his neatly folded clothes on a chair near the bed
That has no place in this house
know
She picks up the pile of clothes and the pistol and places them in a chest
It will go when he goes
As Samuel comes in with old Stoltzfus and Stoltzfus's teenage son,
Thank you for coming, Stoltzfus
Stoltzfus's eyes have gone to the bed: That's the English is it
As Stoltzfus runs his fingers lightly over the vicinity of Book's wound: (
) feel
burning
As Stoltzfus, in his shirt sleeves and concentrating mightily, moistens his fingertips with saliva, continues the examination
Finally he steps back
This man should be treated in town
(indicates) The bullet entered there
and came out there
But there is the danger of infection, and he has lost a great deal of blood
Rachel looks at Stoltzfus, then turns away, torn by her dilemma
Her eyes fall on Samuel
Gently she ushers him from the room: Go help Levi with the car, Samuel
She closes the door after him, then turns to face Eli and Stoltzfus: No, he must stay here
Stoltzfus gives Eli a puzzled look
And: Didn't you hear Stoltzfus
What if he dies
Then the sheriff will come
They'll say we broke their laws We'll pray that he doesn't die
But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows
Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands
know God help me,  know that, Eli
(then) But  tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel
Rachel beseeches them helplessly: What else can we do
Levi has hitched Eli's mules to the rear of Book's car and is towing it up the drive toward the barn, with Samuel catching a ride on the bumper
Where she's waiting with the big barn doors thrown open
As the mules tow the car in, she closes the doors
As Stoltzfus and Levi are about to go: Stoltzfus turns to Rachel: Make a poultice
three parts milk, two parts linseed oil
for the infection
'll send Mary by with some teas  will brew myself
Thank you
Stoltzfus turns to Eli: Lapp, 'll have to speak with the diener on this matter
(nods) As you see fit, Stoltzfus
: As Rachel enters, turns up a kerosene lamp which is burning low at bedside
She's carrying the poultice Stoltzfus ordered
Book's brow is beaded with sweat
Rachel seats herself next to the bed, strips away the sweat- soaked sheet
Her eyes take in his bare torso, and we should get the feeling that there's rather more male animal on display here just now than she's quite comfortable with
She begins to apply the poultice
As Book rouses to semi-consciousness, in his delirium he recoils with alarm
It's all right
You have got to lie still
Book stares up at her without recognition, but some of what she says seems to penetrate
He quiets
(soothingly) Yes, much better
As Book lapses back into sleep
Rachel hasn't removed her hand from his chest
Abruptly she does so
She finds herself wondering about this man lying before her, so suddenly a part of her life
She notices details; bruises, scars, the knuckles are hard, grazed, a tattoo on one shoulder
While lost in this reverie, the delirious Philadelphia policeman begins to mutter
Incoherently at first, then the words take shape  swear words; curses; fuck this and that; shit; etc
Rachel rises abruptly, her cheeks coloring, as the barrage of language pours from his mouth
She beats a hasty retreat closing the door swiftly behind her
' He's on the phone: Looks like we're going to need some help from you folks down there
' Where an  is on the phone: want to help any way we can, Chief, but you got to understand we've got upwards of seven thousand Amish over here
And that's just Lancaster County
Who is trying to control his impatience: 've got the woman's name, Sheriff
Lapp
Rachel Lapp
That should simplify your work
The Undersheriff frowns
He doesn't like being talked down to
How about an address
Ah
no
(frowns) Maybe a road or route number
Sorry
The Undersheriff is not impressed
Problem is, Chief, 'bout every third Amishman around here is named Lapp
That or Yoder
Or Hochstetler
(and) Chief, if the Amish have taken your man in,  wouldn't want to hang from a rope until you find him
Schaeffer is tight-lipped with contained fury: Thank you, Sheriff
It's been an education
He hangs up
beat; the man is a study in frustration
Then he glances up
Standing in his doorway are the two plainclothesmen who spotted Carter in Book's office in the earlier scene
And
: bright, sunny afternoon
Where he's leading a team of horses to the barn
In the b
g
three buggies are parked in the barnyard, traces empty
Visitors
Where Book lies in the bed
His fever seems to have subsided
He's coming awake, tries to focus on the room
' the four men in Amish black who are standing around the bed looking down at Book, muttering among themselves in German
These include , the district bishop, a hawk-nosed, sterneyed old fellow; Stoltzfus, a deacon as well as a healer; and two preachers,  and
Eli stands somewhat apart
Another moment of silence, then Book opens his eyes
Tschantz rumbles in German
Well, Stoltzfus, another Lazarus to your credit
He was touched by God's hand
Tschantz grunts, motions, for the other clergy aside with him
Rachel enters briskly with a steaming pot of tea and a cup, smiles
Hello
Book stares at her, then at the old bearded gentlemen
(closing his eyes) Who are they
The leadership of our district
the diener
Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top
They decided to come and see you for themselves
Except Stoltzfus, of course
He came the first day
think he saved your life
Can  have something to drink
Rachel brings him tea
Does anybody know 'm here
Only the elders
How long
What
How long have  been here
Two days
(a beat) Listen, thank you
Thanks for everything
But 've got to go
(frowns) But you can't
He tries to rise, falls back faint
Rachel rearranges the sheet
See
Anyway, you don't have any clothes on
And besides that, Bishop Tschantz wants to talk to you when you feel better
The elders appear to have concluded their conference, and are filing out
Stoltzfus pauses at bedside
Rest, Mr
Book
That's the ticket
And drink my of my tea
He goes
Book is still fending off the dizziness
Rachel puts the teacup to his lips
Tell him his tea stinks
(smiles) You tell him
When you're able
He looks like he's about to drop off again
Rachel rises
(from the door) We're all very happy that you're going to live, John Book
We didn't quite know what we were going to do with you if you died
That penetrates for a moment just before Book slips into sleep again
As the rather worrisome Hershberger frowns: but a gunshot wound
Very serious
It is not the first time we have done this
In the Englischer war of the revolution, old Elmer Miller's grandfather took in gunshot English soldiers
(a tad of pride) Saved them, too
They all nod
What Tschantz says is well known
Then: Still, he should be among his own people
Rachel enters on this last
He'll leave as soon as he is able
He already wants to go
Hershberger gives her a gloomy look, turns to Stoltzfus: How long will that be, Stoltzfus
(shrugs) month
Maybe less
With God's healing love
' ' Schaeffer is knocking at the front doors
beat, then Elaine opens it cautiously, peers out
(half fearfully) Did you find him
Not yet
Suddenly her eyes blaze, she starts to close the door: Then go away, you bastard
Schaeffer quickly  but gently  prevents her from shutting it
Elaine, 've come to apologize for Lt
McElroy
He overstated the department's position
(bitterly) He accused John of taking kickbacks
And you know  anybody who knows John  knows that's a goddamn lie
(smoothly) Of course, Elaine
But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name
(cuts in) Better you should get off my front porch before  get my mace
Elaine,  don't want to have to take you in for questioning
You've got his car, you were the last to see him (clipped) don't know where he is
But
if you had to guess
' McElroy watching
We see a final exchange between Elaine and Schaeffer
Elaine forces the door shut
Schaeffer turns, walks slowly to his car
' As Schaeffer opens the door, climbs in, sinks wearily into the seat, beside McElroy
She say where he is
don't think she knows
Schaeffer is staring grimly ahead
What about Carter
Tight
But 'm working on him
Lean on him
, and  to the upstairs sickroom window where a lamp dimly burns
As Samuel comes in with a fresh bedpan
Book is lying asleep on the bed
Samuel puts the bedpan down, checks to make sure Book is indeed asleep, then quietly crosses to the foot of the bed and opens the clothes chest
Book's big
38 revolver lies holstered atop his folded clothes
Fascinated, Samuel picks it up, admiring the heavy burled pistol grips
Unable to resist, he starts to remove the weapon from the holster, then pauses to steal a look
His eyes are open and watching Samuel icily, which gives the boy something of a jolt
Give me that
Mutely, Samuel hands Book the pistol from arm's length
He looks on as Book takes the pistol out of the holster, shoots the boy another look, then snaps open the cylinder and shakes out the heavy, copper-jacketed bullets into his palm
He snaps the cylinder closed again, then nods to Samuel
Come here
The boy edges closer
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel
(swallows) No pistol
Ever
Tell you what  'm going to let you handle this one
But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma
've got a feeling she wouldn't understand
(grins) Okay, Mr
Book
Book smiles
Then he gives the boy a playful, John Wayne- tough guy wink as he cocks and uncorks the pistol, demonstrating the action
He finally hands it over to Samuel, butt first
Call me John
The boy tries to imitate Book's one-handed expertise, but his hands are too small
Book smiles
Samuel finally manages to get the thing cocked, using two hands, and Book reaches over to guide the muzzle away so that it's not pointed at him
You don't want to point that at people you just started calling by their first name
Samuel levels the pistol at the door and, just as he snaps the trigger, Rachel enters, pulls up short in some dismay to find her son has a gun pointed at her
Samuel blanches and Book winces, knowing there's heavy weather ahead
(snaps) Samuel
Samuel quickly hands the pistol back to Book, who holsters it: Wait for me downstairs
Samuel quickly exits, and Rachel angrily advances on Book
John Book,  would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible
Nobody meant any harm
The boy was curious
unloaded the gun - It's not the gun
Don't you understand
It's you
What you stand for
(and) That is not for Samuel
Book looks at her thoughtfully
Rachel softens a bit: Please, it has nothing to do with you personally
He hands her the holstered gun and the loose bullets
Put it up someplace Samuel can't get it
beat, then Rachel, takes the pistol and starts to go
Book stops her: Friends
Rachel glances back at him, smiles and nods
And
: Book's holstered gun and bullets at center table
Eli sits on one side, a chastened Samuel on the other
Rachel looks on from the b
g
Eli knows that this is as important a dialogue as he will ever have with his grandson: at issue is one of the central pillars of the Amish way
The gun  that gun of the hand  is for the taking of human life
Would you kill another man
Eh
Samuel stares at it, not meeting his grandfather's eyes
Eli leans forward, extends his hands ceremonially
What you take into your hands, you take into your heart
beat, then Samuel musters some defiance
would only kill a bad man
Only a bad man
see
And you know these bad men on sight
You are able to look into their hearts and see this badness
can see what they do
Now he meets Eli's eyes: have seen it
Eli expels a deep sigh; then: And having seen, you would become one of them
(intent
gesturing) Don't you see
The hand leads the arm leads the shoulder leads the head
leads the heart
The one goes into the other into the other into the other
And you have changed, and gone amongst them
He breaks off, bows his head for a moment
Then he fixes the boy with a stern eye and, driving he heel of his palm firmly into the tabletop with enormous intensity: "Wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate, saith the Lord
" (indicating pistol; continuing from Corinthians 6:17) "And touch not the unclean thing
" His intensity tinged with righteous anger, he is hugely impressive
Book stands near the door to the kitchen, and has heard most or all of Eli's words
He turns, and painfully makes his way into the washhouse, moving quietly, hoping no one will come out from the kitchen
Samuel harnesses up the family mare, and backs her into the traces of the buggy
' Book stands at the window in a worn robe
Below, through the window, we can see Samuel and Eli in the barnyard
beat, then Book crosses impatiently back to his bed, sits down, picks up a dog-earred copy of The American Dairyman
There's a stack of well-thumbed farm magazines and copies of The Budget (the Amish newspaper) on the bedside table
There's a knock
Rachel enters carrying a pile of clothing
She smiles
Enjoying your reading
Very interesting
'm learning a lot about manure
(eyes the clothing) What's that
Your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood
have them soaking
You can wear these
She passes the clothes to Book
Your husband's
Yes
It's good that someone can have the use of them
Besides, in your clothes you'd stand out to strangers
She continues, cheerfully
should tell you these do not have buttons
(shows him) See
Hooks and eyes
Something wrong with buttons
Buttons are Hochmut
Hochmut
Vain
Proud
Such a person is Hochmutsnarr
He is not plain
(nodding) Anything against zippers
(almost blushing) You make fun of me
Like the tourists
Driving by all the time
Some even come into the yard
Very rude
They seem to think we are quaint
Quaint
Can't imagine why
She smiles
Where's the nearest telephone
Telephone
The Gunthers across the valley
They're Mennonite
They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even
No
'd want a public phone
Rachel's face clouds
Well
the store at Saltzburg
(then briskly) But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while
'm going this morning
But Stoltzfus said
(cutting in) know what he said
You can go with Eli
He's taking Samuel to school
But you'll have to hurry
Rachel turns to leave when Book calls her back
Rachel
She turns to look at him
It's the first time he's used her name
Thanks
She smiles and leaves
Eli calls impatiently from the buggy
Samuel sits beside him
Hurry up now, John Book
Rachel washing dishes turns on hearing Book enter
She laughs out loud at the sight of him in his Amish gear, and rightly so  the pants are highwater, the hat low-rise, the jacket ill-fitting
Book looks self-conscious, even a little sheepish
Outside another  from Eli
You'd better go
Book looks embarrassed
My
eh
gun
The smile fades from Rachel's face as she reaches up into a cupboard
She passes the gun in its holster to Book
He fastens it about him
The contradiction of an "Armed Amishman" increases the awkwardness between them
Book turns his back to her and checks the weapon
He turns back to her smiling in an odd way
The
bullets
Oh
The bullets
She takes them out of a disused coffee jar, passes them to Book
(attempting a joke) Not much good without them
Samuel sits between Eli and Book
Both men stare straight ahead
Eli looks particularly stern
It's pretty clear he doesn't like this Englishman wearing the clothes of his faith
-- With awave Samuel runs into the schoolyard to join his friends
teacher begins ringing a bell
Book on the telephone waiting for his call to be answered
He looks about him  several Amish and Dithers mingle in the shop
Book-has gotten a coke from a machine, seems a bit self- conscious shout it sips at it surreptitiously
voice comes on the line; it's that of Book's partner
Yeah
silence
It's me
Johnny
Where the hell have you been
Never mind
'm coming in to take care of business
How hot am
(low, urgent) Too hot
Don't do it
Don't come in
'm coming
Listen, Johnny, don't do anything stupid
You couldn't get within a mile of Schaeffer right now
So stay put
Stay in touch  'll let you know when maybe it makes sense
beat as Book considers that
(edgily) You hear me
(finally) hear you
'll stay in touch
That's more like it
(and) Where are you at, anyway
Book allows himself a small smile, regarding his Amish image reflected in the window of the store
Where 'm at is maybe 1890
(uncomprehending) Say again
Make that 1790
He hangs up
beat, then he stares toward the door of the store
Book works on his car
The battery has gone flat and he's trying to charge it up by running wires to a battery mounted under the front seat of the Lapp buggy
Eli stands at the barn door staring at him, again the disapproving look
If you are well enough to do that thing, you can do work for me
Book is genuinely apologetic
Sure, 'm sorry
Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery
Mine's dead
How can  help
What can do
Maybe milking
(eyes Eli) Milking
Cows
You know, cows
've seen pictures
Good, you start tomorrow
' Where Book lies asleep
beat, then Eli comes in carrying a lamp
He pauses a moment to peer at the sleeping figure with undisguised anticipation
Then he gives him a jarring thump: (briskly) Veck oufl
Time for milking
Book comes groggily awake as Eli exits
He gropes for his watch
It reads 4:30 a
m
As he stares at it in disbelief
As the milk herd of half dozen or so cows ambles in with Samuel prodding them along, headed for the milking stalls
Book looks on in the lamplight, nonplused
Where he's pitching hay into the cow's feed-troughs
, Where the old man is showing Book how to milk a cow by hand
We see Rachel watching from the milkhouse door (steam from scalding milk cans rising behind her)
Good, firm twist and pull, eh
(and) Right
Now you try it
Book gives him a look, takes over the milking stool
The cow shoots him a rather skeptical look over her shoulder
Book bends to his task
Didn't you hear me, Book
Pull
You never had your hands on a teat before
(grimly) Not one this big
Eli unexpectedly finds this hilarious, cackles, gives Book a comradely, man-of-the-world thump on the shoulder that jars him
Then he moves off
Book bends to his task, and
Grinning, giggling, covering her mouth with one hand
As he pours a pail full of milk into a large, stainless steel milk can
As the milk herd is released back into the pasture
Book crosses into the f
g
, stares
' And dawnfire etching the hilltops
The  behind the house, the sun reflecting from the heavy bell beneath its small roof
Something in him can't help but respond to the beauty
beat, then he blows on his hands, rubs them briskly together against the morning chill, and turns back to the barn
It is later in the morning
Rachel comes out onto the porch, tosses a pan of dirty dishwater off onto the grass, looks toward the barn
Eli and Book standing in one of the open doorways, looking in
Luke, one of Eli's team of fine mules as Samuel opens the stall gate
The beast is skittish, obviously afflicted with something of a behavioral problem
But he allows Samuel to lead him out
, As Samuel brings Luke out
Eli is now harnessing the other mule of the team to a large manure-spreader
But as Luke nears Book, his eyes widen and he shies, almost hauling Samuel off his feet
(alarmed) Careful, son Book moves to Samuel's aid; a gesture which proves a serious mistake
Luke erupts into a , bucking cyclone
Samuel who no doubt has been here before  dives nimbly for cover as a flying hoof nearly takes Book's head off
Then Eli hustles into the fray, pushing Book aside as he belligerently in German at the rearing animal
Finally he gives Luke a swat upside the head that seems, somehow, to have the effect of quieting the beast instantly
Samuel gives the shaken Book a look: That's Luke
He doesn't like strangers
(still shaken) You don't say
Eli leads the pacified mule back to the traces, grunting at Book
Have to teach you mules, too,  guess
: Book collects the pieces of the birdhouse which his car knocked down the day of his attempted departure
He pauses as a figure approaches
We recognize Daniel Hochstetler, Rachel's would-be suitor
He heads for Book with an outgoing smile and outstretched hand
Here's a likable man who likes people
Good morning
Book, is it
You are the Yankee they talk about
thought  was the English
English, Yankee
It's the same
My name is Daniel
Daniel Hochstetler
(sizes up his clothes) You look plain, Book
(grinning) Very plain
Book is not particularly amused
came to see Rachel Lapp
Try the house
Hochstetler gives Book a powerful clap on the shoulder
(genially) You bet
you take care of yourself
Hochstetler heads for the house
Book stares after him with some interest
As Rachel emerges from the house to greet him
She also catches sight of Book and she pauses, a shadow of confusion crossing her expression for an instant
And Hochstetler doesn't miss it either
Then she gives her suitor a genuine smile of welcome
Book, having gathered up the pieces of the bird house, is headed toward the outbuildings, passing by hog pens
He glances toward the house: Where Rachel and Hochstetler are sitting in a porch swing, sharing a pitcher of lemonade
Thoughtful
He glances at the hog pen as a huge sow and angrily noses her young ones away from the trough so she can feed
Pigs
, Book works on repairing the broken birdhouse when Rachel enters
He uses a drawknife on a piece of 2x4, with some obvious expertise
Eli is a fine carpenter
Best in the district
He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago
Oh
(and) What happened to Hochstetler
We had some lemonade and he left
real fireball
Rachel smiles
Book crosses to a workbench and selects another tool
You know carpentry
did some carpentry summers when was going to school
What else can you do
(really annoyed) can whack people
'm hell at whacking
Whacking is not of much use on a farm
Now hold on
There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job
'm sorry
'm sure it is
She turns, starts to go
Then turns back, eyeing his makeshift garb: Tonight 'll let out those trousers for you
Stifling a smile, she goes
on Book a beat, then
: Eli is seated at the head of the table, Book opposite Samuel and Rachel
The table is piled high with an incredible amount of food
Eli eyes Book cagily, waves his fork at him: Eat up, Book
What's the matter with your appetite
Guess 'm not used to so much
(snorts) Not used to hard work
That's what makes an appetite
Book swallows that one
With difficulty
Rachel intervenes: Eli, John is a carpenter
(conciliatory afterthought) As well as being a fine policeman
Eh
Well then, maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising, eh
See how good a carpenter
Book can't refuse the challenge
Sure
But
You may not be well enough
'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' tea
/ As Rachel, lamp in hand, walks up to the barn
She looks in to find Book tinkering with the battery hookup to the Lapp buggy
He glances up as she enters: Hi
As she sets her lamp down near the one he's using
(beat) When will you be going
Not long
few days
Another beat as Rachel watches him
Book, checking out the battery power, hits the radio  and suddenly from the Twentieth Century comes the sound of one of its major inventions  rock and roll
It fills the barn, but Book turns up the volume a click more even and, eyeing Rachel, starts moving with the beat
It's his culture, coming through loud and clear, as incongruous as it all might seem with the tough Philly cop decked out in Amish
Rachel can't help but laugh
Sensing her response, Book sweeps her up and they boogie in the lamplight, Rachel alternately protesting and laughing
You like it
Don't you
Rachel, confused, protests: No
You just stop But she doesn't really want to
Book grins: (mock alarm) Next thing you know you'll be off drinking beer and racing motorcycles
And it goes on
Rachel alternately protesting and laughing
As Eli suddenly appears
He glowers for an instant, thunderstruck, then : Rachel
As Book and Rachel's dancing comes to a sudden halt
Both turn, look at Eli
Rachel regards him level-eyed, without discernible alarm
Book, looking a bit sheepish, goes over, turns off the radio, as: (in the dialect) What is this
This Myusick
Book hesitates, then starts to say something: It's not her fault But he gets such a look from Eli that he turns, goes out
(in the dialect) How can this be
How can you do such a thing
Is this plain
Is this the ordnung
have done nothing against the ordnung
(in the dialect) Eh
Nothing
Rachel, you bring this man to our house
With his gun of the hand
You bring fear to this house
Fear of English with guns coming after
You bring blood and whispers of more blood
Now English music
and you are dancing to English music
And you call this nothing
have committed no sin
(in English) No sin
Maybe
Not yet
But, Rachel, it does not look
(tone softening
in the dialect) Don't you know there has been talk
Talk about you, not him
Talk about going to the Bishop
About having you
shunned
That is idle talk
(in English, pleading) Do not make light of it, Rachel
They can do it
quick
Like that
And then
then  can not sit at table with you
can not take a thing from your hand
can not go with you to meeting
(the old man almost breaks down as, in the dialect) Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go too far
Dear child
Rachel is annoyed  also touched, no doubt, by the old man's plea  but irked by his condescending tone
am not a child
(suddenly stern again) You are acting like one
will be the judge of that
(fierce as a prophet) No
They will be the judge of that
And so will
if you shame me
(blinking a tear now, but meeting his gaze) You shame yourself
And shaken  but proud and erect  she turns and walks out
' Carter sits, Schaeffer prowls
slowly, letting silences grow before he strikes again with another softly-snarled question or statement
You know where he is
Wrong
You'd lie to protect him
(cool) Probably
Schaeffer snaps around, glares at him
You admit you're lying
(shakes head) admit  don't know where he is
You're the first one he'll contact
(sighing) He's got my number
Schaeffer stops, stands in front of Carter, takes a deep breath
suddenly smiles
And is abruptly (as he is capable of being) the man of charm and gentlemanly reason
He even as he begins: It's funny
know he's hiding somewhere with the Amish,  know it
(a quick glance at Carter) Can you imagine John Book at a prayer meeting
Our John Book
Schaeffer  again, looks hopefully again at Carter
Carter looks back, stony-eyed
Schaeffer makes another abrupt shift in form
but still speaks softly
Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton
(he nods his head, as) Tell me what you know
What  know, Paul, is
(nodding his head) He's going to take you out
As Book pauses by the barn door, glances over his shoulder
With trace horse harnessed
Samuel and Eli loading provisions into the buggy, standing down by the house
/ As he goes into the barn
Book approaches Luke's stall warily
and as he does so the temperamental mule, reacting to form, starts to skitter, his hooves  against the walls of the stall
Book flinches
Book starts to talk gently to the animal: All right, you nasty son of a bitch, we're going to be friends whether you like it or not
Then, summoning his resolve, he carefully opens the stall gate
As Luke eyes him balefully, Book reaches into his pocket, brings out some lumps of sugar
See
Sugar
You like sugar, don't you for Christ's sake
Finally, keeping a mistrustful eye on Book, Luke condescends to eat
Book nods with satisfaction
Rachel has entered the barn, is watching Book with a puzzled expression
(surprised) Well
Book turns, grins with some pride of accomplishment
Won him over just like that
see
(and) But  hope you have a lot of sugar
(then, going) Eli is ready to go to Zook's
Just then Luke skitters impatiently
Book gives him a nervous look; one last tentative pat as Luke eyes him skeptically, then closes the stall gate and turns to go: Later
And we
it's early morning as the Amish buggies are arriving at the Zook farm for a barn-raising
In the b
g
we can see big stacks of lumber all around the construction site where a couple of dozen men have begun raising the main supports on the already laid foundation
Elsewhere, long tables have been set up and women are spreading them with cloths, setting out big tanks of hot coffee and cold lemonade for the men, As Eli, Book, Rachel and Samuel step down, Book eyes the construction site
Wait here 'til  find a gang you can work with
He goes
Book glances around as even more buggies arrive and more workmen and their families climb out
Eli appears with Hochstetler in tow
Hochstetler's broad face breaks into a grin: Book
Good to see you
He pumps Book's hand with his usual vigor, smiling a greeting and pleasantry to Rachel
She looks on, amused
Hochstetler gives Rachel a look, and we realize that his showing up just now to appropriate Book was no happenstance
And Book realizes it as well
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book
It's been a while
No matter
Come with me
We can always use a good carpenter
With that he throws a huge arm around Book's shoulder and ushers him away
Rachel calls after them: Good luck
/ As they move off
Your hole is healed, then
(gives him a look) Pretty much
Hochstetler nods with satisfaction: Good
Then you can go home
: As the morning progresses: Book and Hochstetler sawing and augering out heavy timbers on big sawhorses
There's an unmistakable atmosphere of competition between the two men, which doesn't go entirely unnoticed by the half-dozen or so other young men on the gang
or, indeed, by Rachel; in fact, she seems  without leaning on it too heavily  to be measuring the two men as the morning progresses, and she occasionally passes within proximity of them
Eli and a couple of other elders prowling the job with sheaves of hand-drawn sketches under their arms, supervising the construction
All around them the structure is rising with remarkable rapidity
Rachel, where she's helping the women set out the huge noon meal
Other women are sitting on benches in the b
g
, knitting or doing quiltwork
Samuel, where he's banging away with a hammer, with a group of boys his own age
Elsewhere we see little girls "botching" (a hand-clapping game played to German rhymes)
The very elderly; sitting on the grass or in wheelchairs in the sunlight, looking on  the old men kibitzing in German, the women gossiping
Until
Of the barn-raising with the noon sun high overhead
at least a hundred and fifty men are swarming over and about the barn framework
some aid the rafters, some hauling lumber to the job, others sawing, hammering, drilling, joining, planing and what-all
so many that the barn seems almost to be rearing up before our very eyes
And there isn't a power tool in sight
' As Rachel crosses near the benches
we can see other women eyeing her, whispering among themselves, some tittering
Rachel ignores them
She joins the stoutly amiable Mrs
Yoder from the funeral sequence earlier
The older woman is emptying a big pan of fried chicken into serving platters
She smiles, obviously liking Rachel
Everyone has an idea about you and the English
All of them charitable, 'm sure
Hardly any of them
Book and Hochstetler astride the roofbeam studs, holding them together prior to nailing them to the roof-beam
They are, therefore, crotch to the mast and facing one another, way out at the far end of the roof
Suddenly, as Hochstetler raises his hammer, the studs start to part, threatening to de-ball the both of them
Hochstetler drops his hammer, grabs both sides of the roof with incredible brute strength, and, literally, pulls it back together
Book stares at Hochstetler with nothing short of awe
Hochstetler, straining and grinning, looks to Book: Nail it
Yes, sir
And he does nail it while Hochstetler, grinning and holding, looks on
: The barn is done, the workmen climbing down from the rafters
It's late afternoon
He hesitates
His face is pale and covered with sweat
The exertion of the day has taken its toll
He's in danger of fainting and is some forty feet above the ground
But he's determined it won't happen, determined that he won't fall, nor will he humiliate himself by calling for help
Hochstetler guesses the situation
He moves beside Book, claps an arm about him, says nothing, doesn't even look at Book
From below, someone  them to hurry up
Hochstetler shouts: We admire our work
The moment passes for Book, and he's okay
Hochstetler removes his supporting arm
Book looks him in the eye, nods his appreciation almost imperceptibly
Hochstetler wants no thanks, and Book knows it
Hochstetler gives him a resounding on the back, and starts climbing down
Book follows
The gathering has congregated to hear Bishop Tschantz offer up a blessing on the new barn
the faces as they listen to the heavy German words rolling out over the still evening air
Book stands a little to one side of the Amish
The prayers he cannot share with them
Rachel is aware of this, feels something of his emotion
She looks toward him, then she too closes her eyes and drifts away from him, into the soothing prayer
: Book stands outside, listening to the
He turns, walks up toward the porch
Book takes a seat in a chair, , looks toward the night sky
There is a , but it's a moment before he turns his eyes toward the door
Samuel standing there in his nightshirt
As Book leans forward in his chair
Hey, Sam
want to say a thing
(sitting up) What's that, Sam
The boy hesitates, holds for a time, then suddenly darts across to Book, wraps his arms around him, hugs him tightly
then breaks away, turns and runs hack into the house, leaving the door open behind him
Looking after the boy, genuinely moved
After a moment, he speaks softly: Same to you, Sam
After another moment, he gets up, moves to close the door that Samuel has left open behind him
From the lighted/shadowed area outside the door
He comes to the door, starts to close it, then hesitates, looks into see where the light is coming from
He looks down the corridor
The light is obviously coming from the kitchen
He speaks softly: Sam
No answer
Book steps inside, pulls the door shut behind him, moves down-the corridor toward the kitchen
Where Rachel, dressed only in a plain cotton camisole, is pouring a pail of steaming water into a tub
She replaces the pail on the stove, turns and slips out of her camisole
Naked, she folds the garment across the back of a chair
Then she pauses, containing a startled intake of breath
' The gleaming bottom of a large copper skillet hanging over the stove with other cookware, we can see Book's image reflected there, framed in the kitchen doorway
Rachel hesitates for a moment  and in that moment she makes a choice
Slowly she turns, to face him, without shame, meeting his eyes
And for a moment she attempts something: a look, a flash of eve
a lovely, heartbreakingly innocent effort to become, for an instant, a woman of Book's world
As he stands in the doorway, willing himself to leave, unable to make it happen
And suddenly the moment has passed
Rachel lowers her eyes, picks up the camisole, covers herself with it without putting it on, looks away
to him, and
: Where Rachel is scattering feed to the chickens
beat, then Book approaches from behind her
moment, as she senses his presence
Book watches as Rachel begins to gather the eggs, placing them in the fold of her apron
When he speaks, he speaks softly, and she pauses in her work
Last night
She goes very still, but keeps her back to him
If
we'd made love, then,  couldn't leave
She lowers her head slightly, but remains turned away from him
Book continues to stare at her
The Lapp carriage on a winding lane
() Rachel is driving, Book sitting next to her
Samuel is in the back, looking out the rear window and not paying any attention to the adults
beat, then a large produce truck roars past them
It's all Book can do to keep from flinching
Rachel stares straight ahead
Book glances at her
Maybe  ought to learn to drive this thing
Rachel says nothing
(beat) Pick myself up another useful skill
Now Rachel can't help but smile
She looks at him
And
We can see the Lapp buggy approaching a rural intersection, another buggy approaching at right angles
As Rachel eyes the other buggy through the windshield
Samuel, who is that
Samuel checks out the buggy
It looks like Hochstetler's mare
As the Lapp buggy passes the intersection and the Hochstetler buggy swings in behind them
Then the Hochstetler buggy, coming on at a faster clip, starts to pass the Lapp buggy
As Rachel waves at the occupants of the other buggy; Daniel returns her greeting: (teasing her) Uh oh, they're leaving us behind
Rachel gives him a look, and
gives the reins a flick the race is on
Hochstetler has a couple of older folk on board, together with his young sister  at first they're not aware of the race, until Daniel can contain his excitement no longer and gives his horse a couple of whoops
The buggies are neck and neck, and the older people are not protesting loudly
It's all Book can do to refrain from grabbing the reins off Rachel, but she's something of a horsewoman and finally she gains the edge and pulls ahead of Hochstetler, to the cheers of Samuel and Book
It's a Saturday afternoon in the tourist season, and they're everywhere  taking shots of anything Amish
There's a amongst them who are making their presence fast, and generally making a nuisance of themselves
Book and Rachel get out of the buggy
Samuel stays inside; the crowds make him nervous
huge tourist bus billowing smoke pulls up nearby
Rachel enters the store, but before Book can follow he's stopped by a   with an instamatic camera
She waggles the camera at him
Could
ah, you know
(smiling) Lady, if you take my picture, 'll rip your brassiere off and strangle you with it
The Tourist Lady stares at him in stunned disbelief, her grin frozen on her face
Then she begins to scuttle back from whence she came
Rachel is browsing among the stocked shelves in the company of a young Amish woman, Ellie Beiler
Rachel is carrying Ellie's tiny baby, and the infant is getting as much attention as the shopping
Book is standing at a wall pay phone in the b
g
We to him, and
Lieutenant Elton Carter, please
beat, then we hear the   of the Philadelphia Police Department switchboard: Are you a member of the family
What
'm a friend of his
'm sorry
Last night Sergeant Carter was killed in the line of duty
Book hangs up
His breathing is thrown out by the shock of the news and he takes a couple of deep breaths to regain control
He hesitates, unsure of his next move
He makes to move away, then he turns back, finds more coins and dials a second number
, ' Schaeffer's wife answers the phone; she is momentarily shocked
She calls for her husband, then makes polite conversation
How are you, John
Paul Schaeffer appears, slightly irritated at being called away from the Saturday afternoon game
(covering mouthpiece) John Book
'll take it in the study
/ Schaeffer takes the phone
You can hang up, dear
We  the click of the other phone, You made a mistake, Paul
You shouldn't have taken Elton out
(beat) How bad did Mac get you
We figured pretty bad
'm fine
'm going to live a long time
That's what  called to tell you
(quickly) Johnny You might want to pass it along to Mac
(urgently) Listen to me, Johnny
Come in
You're out there all alone
We're getting close
real close
Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in 've already got something worked out
(and) Be seeing you
Book hangs up the phone and the dead  registers on Schaeffer
Book has gripped the phone so tightly that it takes a second to unclench his fist
Then it takes something else to resist his first impulse, which is to smash out at something
Training
Get it under control
Deal rationally with the situation
He straightens his jacket, wipes the sweat/tears from his eyes, turns and walks stiffly out of the Saltzburg General Store
Book, as Rachel eyes him
She has noticed his changed mood, but doesn't ask about it
He stares straight ahead, oblivious to the surroundings of the street, now crawling with tourists and traffic
The buggy turns into the side street
Some hundred yards ahead another buggy is stopped in the middle of the road several youths gathered about it
pickup truck is stopped, facing the buggy
As Rachel approaches the scene, slowing down and finally stopping
Rachel is at first puzzled, then makes a small face, looks at Book
Rachel puts a restraining hand on Book's arm
Do nothing
This happens from time to time
She senses him about to get out, grips his arm tightly
It's not our way, John
We'll have nothing to do with violence
John
Book shakes free, gets out and slowly walks toward the
' Hochstetler and his family sit, impassive, ignoring various jeers and taunts from the English lads  various jokes about them being dirty etc
One jabs an ice cream cone into Hochstetler's forehead, which leaves a curious white circle on his forehead
Another fools about with the horse causing it to shy
third notices the slow, sure, approach of John Book
Here comes another one
Book stops, his path blocked by the third youth
The youth flicks off Book's hat
(quietly) You're making a mistake
Hochstetler calls from his buggy
Everything is all right, John
(to the youth) Pick up the hat
The youth momentarily unsure  something about Book's tone of voice
The youth does pick up the hat, crumples it, stamps on it, and puts it back at a crazy angle on Book's head pause, then Book explodes
The kid never knew what hit him or where it came from, he hits the road surface already unconscious
second youth grabs Book from behind
mistake
Book is smashing into him, spatters of blood from his nose flying in all directions
He's hitting too hard, too often
It's Schaeffer he's hitting
Hochstetler is pulling him away, Rachel is there too
crowd is gathering, but as suddenly as it began it's over
Book shakes Hochstetler off him, straightens his hat, and in a kind of daze, begins walking past the scene in the direction of the Lapp farm
The youths are picking up their wounded, helping them back to their truck, aided by none other than Hochstetler
An addresses Rachel
Never seen anything like that in all my years
(covering) He's from
Ohio
My cousin
We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different
(addresses a gathering crow) Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them
John, lost control of himself
He
will be repentant
(to Rachel) You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you
Yes
Samuel
We're going
second man calls from the pickup
Kid's nose is broken
We'll take him up the hospital
Good- day to you, Mrs
Lapp
(he shouts after her) This ain't good for the tourist trade, you know
You tell that to your Ohio cousin
But Rachel is already steering past the scene and following the by now distant figure of John Book
/ ' Book comes out of the carpenter's shop carrying the repaired birdhouse on its pole in one hand, a shovel in the other
Rachel is shepherding the milking cows toward the barn
You should not bother with that birdhouse
(a beat) If you're leaving tomorrow
'm leaving tonight
(and) 'm going to need my clothes
And my gun
She nods, looks away
looks back at him twice in glances
There is a moment when it appears she might either bark at him or begin to weep
He waits
When she does turn to him, she speaks softly: There was a time when  thought you might have stayed
(hesitating
then) There was
There was a time when  would have welcomed it
(after a beat) know
(asking) was being foolish
No
(and) was being unrealistic
Even thinking about living this life
You're so sure of that
Aren't you
After today
(almost conceding it, but
her voice rising a bit, annoyed) 'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book
You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough
(a beat) Just as  could live yours
(almost groaning) Oh, come on, Rachel
No way
There is always a way
But you are such a
a Glotzkopp you cannot see
You'd rather go back to that city
To nothing
No woman
No children
No land
(now getting annoyed) Land
Are you crazy
'm no Amishman and 'm no farmer
'm a cop
That's what  know and that's what  do
What you do is take vengeance
Which is a sin against heaven
That's your way, not mine
That's God's way
Well in the City of Philadelphia, God needs a little help
He has offended her, immediately knows it, but can't bring himself to make an instant apology
But he's chewing on it when she takes the moment unto herself
She pulls herself up, speaks with great dignity: could never love a man who was so
little
He looks at her, sad-eyed, his anger ebbing and gone, realizing that he'll never meet a finer woman
never even get close to such a one
He appears to start to speak, but then does not
She turns, moves away a few steps, stops, looks back at him
she holds for a moment, blinking tears, then speaks with some difficulty, emotion welling in her words
The other night
when you saw me after my bath
tried to look as  thought you would want a woman to look
(sadly
but with a slight, proud lift of chin) am sorry
that  did not
She holds for an instant, then turns and walks off
Looking after her
face full of loss
Eli is lighting the lamps
Samuel reads a book at the kitchen table
Rachel moves slowly to the sink and begins washing a few dishes
She looks out the window
on her face, a strange expression
/  ' The distant figure of Book working on the birdhouse
on Rachel's hands, lifting items slowly up and of the water to the draining board, where she places them carefully down
She shakes the water off her hands
on her face, still staring fixedly out the window
She speaks without turning around
Eli, would you see Samuel to bed
The old man glances at her; this is not their routine
In the rapidly fading light, Rachel walks slowly toward Book
on her face, staring straight ahead toward Book
on Book,
He turns and watches Rachel's approach
The light now nearly gone, the   beginning, as Rachel reaches Book and they embrace
Book and Rachel in a passionate embrace, sink to the still warm earth and make love
an all-night cafe in the early hours of the morning
to the bleakly lighted windows
booth, where Schaeffer and McElroy and Fergie, a Lancaster County Undersheriff and his   an expansive politician type  are seated
The Undersheriff eyes Schaeffer narrowly
The Sheriff has a county map spread out on the table, amid breakfast dishes, pointing directions to Schaeffer: There
White Oak Road a couple of miles before it ties into two-twenty- two
Got it
Got it
We owe you one, Sheriff
My man Holmes here put it together
Fine officer, Chief
He spoke to the doctor at the hospital
Undersheriff Holmes and  have talked on the phone
(nods at Holmes) Good work
Sure you don't want us to post some backup units
If we need any help, we'll give you a shout
'd like to slip in there quiet, then get out before we attract any attention
As Schaeffer and his men are climbing into their car
Holmes and the Sheriff watch after them
Maybe 'll take a drive over that way
Let 'em be
It's their dirty laundry
But Holmes pauses to watch Schaeffer's car pull out
With the first light of dawn on the eastern horizon, Schaeffer's car approaches along the lane, pulls into the Lapp driveway and comes to a halt
In the b
g
we can make out the farmhouse and outbuildings
as Schaeffer, McElroy and Fergie step out of the car
They break out short-barreled twelve-gauge pumps, start , spreading out as they turn up the long driveway
figures of ominous intent striding through the misty dawn
the trio of gunmen
McElroy, breath smoking in the chill, eyes the terrain: Weird, man
No fuckin' electricity
What do you figure they plug all their shit into
They don't have any shit
Where Eli is getting into a heavy coat, preparing to go out
the remains of the hearty morning breakfast are on the table
Rachel is beginning the dishes
Book and Samuel are starting the morning milking
Eli is preparing to extinguish the lamp when suddenly the kitchen door is kicked open and McElroy and Fergie weapons leveled, burst in
Eli reacts with angry shock as Schaeffer enters: Rachel is, for a moment, terrified
(to Fergie) Outside (to Mac) Check out the rest of the house
He turns to Eli, who is standing in the middle of the room
Schaeffer flashes his badge: We're police officers
We're looking for a fugitive, John Book
He's living here
have nothing to say to you
Get out of my house
You speak English
Good
Now listen (recovering) No, you listen
Get out
Lady, 'm here to help you
This man is very dangerous
An armed criminal
(ingratiating) He's got a gun, hasn't he
You have no right here
McElroy re-enters
He's not in this building
(to Eli) All right, where is he
Suddenly Eli : It's deafening
Probably the loudest noise Eli has ever made: John Book
McElroy whips around, smashes Eli on the temple with the butt of his shotgun
Eli crumples to the floor
Rachel , runs to Eli
Book and Samuel in the milkhouse
They've heard Eli's outcry
Book moves to the window, looks out
' About halfway between the barn and the house
He turns from glancing back toward the house (having heard Eli's shout) and starts again toward the barn
Gun at the ready
As Book
Rachel kneeling next to Eli, wiping at his bruise with a damp cloth
Schaeffer looks on
He'll live
You might have killed him
(to McElroy) Find Fergie, check the barns
'll watch these two
McElroy nods, moves outside, turns toward the barns
Book still at the window, Samuel now beside him, trying to get a look
Is it them
(turning, mind racing) It's them, Sam
(he bends to the boy, takes him by the shoulders) Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully
Listen to me as you never listened before
(interrupting) Are they going to kill you
Listen to me, Sam
want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'
Run as fast as you can
And stay there
What are you going to do
'll be all right
You just do as say
He takes Samuel by the hand, leads him to the side door
He bends, holds the boy close
Don't let them hurt you
(rising, pushing Samuel toward door) won't
Now run
(as Sam looks back) Fast as you can
Sam turns, takes off
Samuel running
Fergie almost to the upper barn, McElroy  well back and moving slowly, circumspectly  headed toward the lower barn
Book, at another window in the lower barn, sees McElroy heading for the milkhouse door
He can't see Fergie
He turns, crosses the cowpen area, climbs an inner ladder leading to the upper barn
Fergie at the door to the upper barn, moving very cautiously, gun up
He eases around the doorpost, looks within
Beyond Book, now at the top of the ladder, we see Fergie easing into the barn
Book pulls himself up, crawls behind the wall of the mule stalls, opens gate, eases in beside Luke, urgently whispering and patting the animal to calm him
He gets to the animal's head, crouches, strokes Luke's nose
The mule's huge flanks quiver, his nostril's and eyes widen, but he makes no untoward sound
Book closes the gate
He comes on warily, muzzle first, eyes darting
him as he reaches the first mule's stall, opens the gate
An edgy mule turns, eyes him, shuffles nervously
Fergie backs off, moves on
As he listens, tenses, hearing Fergie's feet in the fresh straw
Book eases back alongside Luke, waits
As he approaches Luke's stall, reaches for the gate-latch
As the gate swings open, Book shouts and gives Luke a whack on the back
The mule's pent-up nerves and feral energy explode in an horrendous
Bowled backwards by the rearing animal as the gate flies open, involuntarily , suddenly finding himself under the lethal hooves of a twelve-hundred pound beast
Staggering backwards, he ,  again, the load striking the mule in its heaving chest as a flailing hoof smashes into Fergie's head and the other hoof snaps his shotgun in half like a matchstick
As he slips out of the stall, ducks toward the rear of the barn
Fallen, skull smashed
and now the dying Luke's legs buckle and he collapses atop Fergie
McElroy standing still, shock-eyed, looking toward the sound of the shots
Then starting slowly forward
On the porch of the house, looking toward the barn
Some distance from the barn, Samuel's hearing the shots, stops dead in his tracks
the sound of the shots still across the quiet fields
(stricken) Mr
Book
He hesitates, then turns, starts trotting back toward the barns
/ Rachel has moved into the open kitchen door, glances anxiously toward the barns
Starts out
Schaeffer pushes her back
Get back in there
My son is out there
Nobody's going to hurt your son
As McElroy, checking the safety on his twelve-gauge, steps into the barn
McElroy flattens himself against the wall, looks around fearfully
(softly) Fergie
Only silence
Schaeffer staring toward the barn, : What the hell happened
He listens, hears nothing, snorts, starts toward the barn checking his gun, not hurrying
Eli now seated at the table, holding a cloth to his head
Rachel at a window, peering out
Schaeffer on the porch Samuel running as fast as he can trips as he crosses a small muddy stream, falls full length, scrambles up, runs on
McElroy, moving very cautiously, comes around the mule stalls, stops short, stares off screen
Where he lies half buried beneath the huge bulk of the mule, his head crushed like an eggshell
As he moves on around Fergie and the dead mule, planting each foot as if he were walking in a mine field
Standing in shadow at the back of the barn next to a hay mow
Moving toward the center of the barn
As he starts to move even further back, he nudges into a rope fastened to the wall behind him, He looks at it, looks up
It runs from where it is fastened to the wall straight up to the center roofbeam of the barn to a trolley fixed to a track that runs the length of the roofbeam
Attached to this trolley is a big hayfork (Paul Krantz has one), -shaped, sharply- pointed at each end of the
the points hanging toward the floor
The thing weighs about eighty pounds, and is suspended in place by the rope anchored at the wall next to Book
Keeping one eye on McElroy, he carefully begins to un-tie the trip rope
Moving out toward the center of the barn, almost under the suspended hay fork
He stops short, listens
Then, either spotting a moving shadow or hearing a , he
His shot rattles off the side of a manure spreader
He : Book, you sneaky bastard,  know you're here
Come out and fight
Samuel, at the top of the barnyard, stops at the , wide-eyed
He listens for an-instant, starts a step toward the barn, then stops again, looks to a large bell suspended in a cupola by one of the outbuildings
He moves quickly to the bell, seizes the rope, pulls
The bell loudly, Sonorously
On the front porch, looking around for the location of the sounding bell
He takes a step toward the barn, the stops, looks back toward the house
frustrated
Book watches as McElroy starts to move again looking back toward the  of the bell
Looking down we can see McElroy almost directly beneath the hay fork
The bell  throughout
Waiting
trip rope in hand
Then: (shouting) Hey, Mac
And he lets go the trip rope
As he turns toward the  of Book's voice
As it plummets down, causing a   that fills the barn, even drowns out the  of the bell
Eyes darting wildly, looking up
Plunging straight for him
Diving to one side
into the barn floor like a great trident fork
Quivering there, not a foot from McElroy's head
Staring at the fork pop-eyed
Sprinting toward a ladder thrust up through an opening in the barn floor just in front of his parked car
Spotting Book, coming up to one knee, quick-aiming,
The shot smashes the windshield of the car
Diving, rolling, slamming into the top of the ladder, flailing down out of sight
, then again
Emptying the gun, cursing as he begins to reload, gets to his feet, starts toward the ladder
The  still  outside
The hood of the car As McElroy wheels at the movement of the car's hood, twice
' The buckshot virtually blows the dashboard off
Samuel  the bell
The bell rope is short, and so is Samuel and his feet go off the ground with every swing of the rockerarm
He hangs on grimly, his black hat clinging to the back of his head, his face set against the tears that move down his cheeks
Comes hesitantly down the path toward the barn, looking toward the sound of the bell, but also looking back in glances toward the house to make sure Rachel and Eli stay where they are
He still can't see Samuel
As Rachel starts off the porch, takes a few steps
Turning, : You stay put
She stops
She is also unable to see Samuel
Moving out toward the barn, rounding a corner
and there is Samuel at the bellrope
He starts toward him
Beyond Samuel, well out in the fields of the Stoltzfus farm, Stotlzfus and others  including Hochstetler and his brothers are baling the first cutting of June hay
But the operation has come to a halt
All are looking in toward the Lapp farm, hearing the     (the Amish cry for help), wondering, hesitating
But now, as we watch, led by Hochstetler, they start in toward Samuel
As Schaeffer reaches Samuel, : Cut that out
Samuel looks at him, keeps on pulling
Schaeffer quickly crosses to him, grabs him by the back of the neck, tries to pull him off the bell rope
Samuel hangs on grimly
Schaeffer yanks hard, succeeds in yanking Samuel free, shoves him roughly aside
Then Schaeffer turns,  a shotgun blast into the top of the bellrope
It still hangs by several threads, so he  again
The rope drops to the ground
Schaeffer reloads, turns to look at Samuel, just getting to his feet
moment
when Schaeffer, recognizing Samuel as the Amish kid who saw McElroy kill Zenovich, perhaps thinks of disposing of the witness right then and there
But a glance toward the oncoming Amish gives him pause
He at Sam: Get down to the house and stay there
Samuel gets to his feet, turns, trots off
Already halfway out to the barn, running to gather Sam in her arms
then to lead him back toward the house
Turning, starting very slowly toward the barn
McElroy at the top of the ladder, looking down
Then easing over, placing his feet on the rungs
He stands below in a cowpen, using the cows for cover
The cows stare balefully at him
large goat nuzzles him, hooks at him with its horns
Book waits, watches
Visible to his knees as he eases down the ladder
He stops at every rung to scrape his shoes free of the cowshit covering the rungs
He turns now to a door at the back of the pen
He un-hooks it, pulls it open, moves inside
He is now in a small passageway giving on to the entrance to a nearly-empty silo
Above the entrance, a ladder (interior) rises to the top of the structure
Book looks in, and up
We should get the impression that Book's been here before, expects what he sees
Forty feet up, a patch of blue sky through an open hatch
He steps through to the base of the ladder, then ducks beyond it into the silo
There is about two feet of old silage covering the floor
He turns, looks up the white walls
An inside ladder runs to the top
Standing against the wall next to the entrance
obviously to be inserted as the silo is filled
Now, quickly, he ducks back out through the entrance, crosses to the door to the cowpen, very cautiously peers out
McElroy at the bottom of the ladder, looking in the other direction (toward the milkhouse)
Very carefully he shoves the cowpen door (which opens outward into the cowpen)
It begins to swing very slowly open
Book immediately turns, darts back into the silo
Turning slowly toward the cowpen
then  twice as his eye catches the motion of the swinging door
His shots blow half a row of Eli's precious tools off an adjacent wall
McElroy reloads, starts across toward the door
Old Eli, at the sight of Samuel, rises from the table
Praise Gott
Rachel stands aside as the old man embraces Samuel long and hard
She watches as he turns to the cupboard, takes down the big family Bible
He crosses to the table, sets the book down, places his hand on its pulls Samuel to the table beside him
Rachel holds another beat as she stares at the old man helplessly, then she rushes to where she hid Book's gun, takes it down
her trembling hands take the bullets out of the coffee jar
She drops several as she tries to figure out how to open the chamber to load it
In the b
g
, Eli glances up, sees what she is about
he rises and crosses to her
Samuel watches from the table
(fiercely) No, Rachel
have to help him
Rachel somehow manages to open the chamber and begins to try to load the bullets
Eli's callused hand closes over hers, halting the action: It is not our way
Bullets are already  to the floor from her trembling fingers as she raises her eyes to Eli's
long beat as Rachel looks at him
Finally her fingers release the pistol and it  to the floor
She closes her eyes
Samuel, who has gotten up, moved to a window, watches Eli and Rachel silently
Eli leads her to the table, places her hands on the Bible beneath his
They stand there and they pray
Book finishes putting the kickboard into the entrance
Moving among the cows, stepping cautiously between the cowflops
The goat nudges him once, then butts him rather firmly
McElroy swats at him with the gun butt, moves to the door
As he arrives, he  a noise  very slight  from the direction of the silo
He enters the passage way, looks in toward the silo entrance, He hesitates
Another slight noise
He steps in to the base of the inner ladder, looks up
The patch of blue sky, forty feet up
He frowns, reaches out, grabs a rung
Schaeffer, easing toward the mule stalls, , under his breath
Then he rounds the corner of the first stall
and there is Fergie with Luke the mule on top of him
Schaeffer stares, blinks
moves on spotting a spent shotgun shell near the hayfork
Book listening at the kickboard
of feet, shotgun rattling against metal rungs, Book moves to the ladder on his side, starts silently up
Climbing with difficulty, shotgun clutched in one hand
He climbs up to the second kickboard, pauses, checks the distance to the floor, starts upward again
The Amish beginning to arrive
Sam comes running, pulls Stoltzfus toward the door of the milkhouse as the other Amish look at the shot-shattered bellrope
Rachel and Eli come rapidly up the path toward the group
Schaeffer finds another spent shotgun shell, crosses to the ladder, looks down
He sets his shotgun down, takes out his service revolver, starts down
Book has reaches the third kickboard, about thirty feet from the ground
He checks it, turns the thumb-screws that hold it in place, places his hand on the handle, moves to one side as best he can
hangs there, listening
Rattling up the other ladder, approaching the third kickboard
Listening tensely, hearing McElroy arrive on the other side of the kickboard
Then, deliberately, Book makes a fist, raps on the board smartly once
Startled,
He sets his feet, leans back against the back wall of the ladder well, brings the shotgun up, puts the muzzle against the kickboard, clicks off the safety
We  with him the thump of the muzzle, the
and, with marvelous speed, Book pulls the kickboard and drops it to the floor
McELROY    Staring in, stun-eyed, already falling forward (having leaned his weight on the shotgun) as Book seizes the shotgun by the barrel, pulls inward
As McElroy pitches forward through the opening,  and as he plunges past Book
The shotgun  as McElroy manages to hold onto Book, and both men plunge thirty feet to the bottom of the silo
He falls almost straight down, lands on his back, lies stunned
His forward motion has carried him across the silo
His head bounds off the white brick wall about five feet up
and he falls in a heap, blood gushing from his head, as
Blinking, groaning, just beginning to stir
and, suddenly, into the frame comes a hand with a pistol in it
The muzzle is placed firmly against Book's temple
Schaeffer holding the pistol
He cocks the pistol, tenses as if to  (and he is actually about to)
when there is a behind him
He snaps around
Old Stoltzfus and Samuel standing in the kickboard opening (Schaeffer having kicked the kickboard in when he heard the shot from within the silo)
They stand solemnly, looking on as: He eases the hammer down on this pistol, speaks softly: Okay, Johnny
On your feet
As Book struggles to his feet  Schaeffer holding the pistol tight to Book's head
Book turns, sees Samuel and Stoltzfus, blinks
Schaeffer shoves Book toward the opening
As Book moves toward Samuel, he speaks quietly: It's okay, Sam
As Book and McElroy move out of the silo, down the passageway toward the milkhouse, Stoltzfus and Sam (after a glance in at the inert McElroy) follow and
As first Stoltzfus and Samuel, then Book and Schaeffer emerge into the barnyard
Schaeffer has the muzzle of his pistol pressed firmly against Book's throat, just below his jaw
Schaeffer pulls up, frowning: Hold it
The Amishmen gathered  the Stoltzfus family, the Hochstetler brothers, et al
All staring hard at Schaeffer and Book
/ From a high wide angle the final scene is played out
Schaeffer and Book, now moving again slowly up the drive, the Amish following along closely on both sides
As Schaeffer prods Book forward, warily eyeing the Amish
Get back, you people
(prodding) Keep moving, Johnny
Book takes a couple of steps further, then abruptly stops
The Amish stand about close, staring, no one moving
Book now slowly turns his head, looks at Schaeffer
You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer
Don't try me, Johnny
Eli steps forward, bloody cloth held to his head
So
will you kill us all, then
As Schaeffer's eyes waver between Book and Eli, Book slowly turns until he is facing Schaeffer
the gun now leveled and almost pressing against  Book's chest
Book locks eyes with Schaeffer
Quietly: It's all over, Paul
Move
Or you die right here
Book's right hand snakes out, grabs Schaeffer by the gunhand wrist, twists viciously, Schaeffer  in pain, the gun falls out of his hand, he starts to his knees under the force of Book's grip
As Book bends, picks up the pistol, releases Schaeffer, pushes him away
Schaeffer staggers against Hochstetler, who  partly to keep him from falling, and partly (it appears) to congratulate him on his surrender  wraps one brawny arm around Schaeffer's shoulders, gives him a short approving nod
holds Schaeffer as: Turning, looking into the crowd, finding Rachel
Their gazes meet, hold for a long
In the eyes of both we read resignation
whatever there was between them has been terribly damaged
It is almost certainly over for them, too
holding the moment
The door opens and Book steps out, looking somehow strange in his working suit
He looks about him, sees Samuel down by the pond
He eases down beside Samuel
They both stare into the pond
Are you really ever coming back
Got to, Sam
You and  are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars
Have you got your gun on now
Sure have, Sam
Sam grins
Book takes him in his arms, holds him
Book opens the door of the car, turns to find Rachel standing there with his Amish hat in hand
want you to take this
to remember by
Where's my baggy pants
Here
Whenever you want them
He wants to kiss her, but does not
Their eyes say it all
Eli has a final word,  from the porch
You be careful, John Book
Out among them English
Book gets quickly into the car
/ As Book drives, he sees an open buggy coming down the hill toward the farm, He slows as he passes, It's Daniel Hochstetler
long beat, and as they pass, Hochstetler gives Book an expansive tip of his hat
' Book turns to look back at his rival, a doubt in his eyes
