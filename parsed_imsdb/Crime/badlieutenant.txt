They raped a nun and tore up the church -- they even took a crap on the altar
Up in Spanish Harlem
She was only seventeen

Who the fuck could do this
The young nun's just a kid from Ireland
Imagine having to come here to have that happen
Jesus
What's she gonna tell her mother

The  keep
All of them lounging around on or beside the
watches quietly, taking it all in
As if following the motto: "He who defines himself, confines himself
" The Church already put up a $50,000 reward
Well, one of us is gonna get it mean -- get them
The   raises a
Here's to payback for the nuns
The  all whoop and cheer
Anyone got any leads, at all
We got shit to go on
Only that list of inventory -- what they stole from the church
'know they actually stole those wacky purple robes
And they took the chalice -- with the Host still inside
What did they want with the Host
They were hungry
dunno
They didn't want to hock the Host, they wanted to hock that golden chalice
avoid each others' eyes
Competition has begun
No one shares information, each after the reward for himself
bursts out, swings into high gear
Leave it to the Catholic Church, man
Girls get raped everyday, and now they're gonna pay 50  just because these chicks wore penguin suits
Some of the  laugh, others are offended
(to ) What's your fucking problem
The Church is a racket
So what
Are you a Catholic
Sure
Do you believe in God
doesn't reply
He's thinking
The   and a couple of , move in
They've got nothing on their minds but the World Series
(to ) To Hell with this God stuff
How's that Strawberry
He does what ever you want him to, huh Lieutenant
Even strike out
(beat) bet you won a shitload on Oakland
How much, huh
comes down off the
Now he has to feign pride in his supposed big bet on
has to convince the  to keep betting -- he can't afford to pay them all off
Unfortunately, the  all think just scored big, himself
More than you did
Well, let's see some green
If you know what's good for you, you'll keep staying on Oakland
Oakland
Is that how you're going
nods "yes
" An outright lie
Yeah
Sure
Don't you get it
The series has gotta last seven games
The last two did, didn't they
It's a racket
Do you have any idea how much money they make selling television-time for commercials during the series
Especially if it's a New York team
They won't close the gold mine after only four games
It'll last a full seven
Too many people wanna milk it for what it's worth
You'll see
All right
'm in
After all, you're the expert
Ain't that right,

One  doesn't go along with the deal

You'll be sorry, man
But if you wanna be a sissy, here's your bread
sits back on top of his ,  heavily
He toasts The others are uneasy
Why toast
Strawberry
thought we were going with Oakland
We are, man
That's the point
If the Mets win, it's thanks to Strawberry
If Oakland wins, it's thanks to Strawberry
Nothing can happen out there on the field that don't gotta do with Strawberry
So here's to Strawberry
The others join in the , but are uneasy
: :   -      - The  is an inferno

He wants to get into the inner sanctum
Beyond where even were allowed to go
He wants to get to the

can't help but check her out and flirt
'm in charge of the investigation
Just checking security
(Suspicious) Security
Do you want those guys coming back
For the nun
Or for you
The  looks at him, unsure, then walks off down the continues his hunt
He comes upon a  that is plastered with "" One too many, perhaps
senses the  is inside
He has to open the , but hopes he won't get a blast of disease in his face
He  himself -- wearing a smirk, but nonetheless
Going on instinct,  opens the door a crack
He's right
It's the
He positions himself outside the , keeping it open a few inches
He peeks inside without being seen
: :   -  ' From just outside the door,  peep-toms on the  while she is being examined
He sees her stark naked, laid out on a table, her legs spread wide apart
The , ,  work on the  as if they are automatons
They don't grasp either the humanity or the trotitism of the scene
does
The image of The Alabaster Nun turns him on no end
Yet there is also a deeper pathos to the scene
And the  is spectacularly beautiful
She doesn't speak
Looks like a Pieta
in a - reads the   to a The   writes down the details on a hard-backed pad
As if it's a parking ticket
The moving contrast between the words and the image seems to be apparent to  -- and the  -- alone
(to Female Cop) They inserted a crucifix eleven centimeters into her vaginal aperture, breaking the hymen membrane
Then they pursued the same course with their natural organs of sexual penetration
They used a sharp object, probably a hunting knife with a curved blade, to carve a cross between her shoulder blades, entering the flesh an average of nearly one centimeter throughout the area of the wound
They -- Finally, as if she knew he was there all along, the  looks up at where  is hiding and boldly meets his eyes

They are alone
They've both been  and
is carrying on about the
As he speaks about various subjects, his tone changes radically
From contempt and cynicism to profound reverence
From decadence -- to awe
, too, manages to switch from one attitude to the other
Have you ever seen a naked nun tell you, man,  went to school with the nuns, 've seen hundreds since then and 've never even seen a nun's belly button, you understand
But this nun, let me tell you
What a beautiful lady
(snaps out of his awe) And where'd the Church get the 50 in the first place
The fucking Church is the biggest scam going
You know what's the real killer
It costs $8,000 per kid for them to go to parochial school
've got three kids in there already, with two on the way
Christ
That fucking reward is my money, man
But that's Church policy
The Pope is the world's biggest bookie
Makes people bet on their own salvation
Double or nothing on Heaven
You go to Hell -- then go to Hell
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was bullshit
can't stop thinking about the rape
can't get over what those guys did to her
just can't
They're alive, aren't they
Come on, man
Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun
Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50  for the guys who dared to rape her
Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped
Of course not
Or even for your little sister
The virgin
Like shit they would
Susie's not a virgin anymore
She's fucking nine years old
Jesus Christ
suddenly starts up
And the nun's not a virgin anymore, either
Will they make her leave the convent
thinks for a moment
Who knows
Who knows what their policy is
(sudden dreamy reverence) But 'll tell you, man, that nun
She was beautiful
Just beautiful
Tall
Real tall
've never seen anything like it
snaps out once again, grabs the
He dials
He's not in
leaves '  on '
Hangs up
(to himself) Lite, man
Where the fuck are you
can't get the image of the rape out of her mind
It's horrible
They burned her breasts with cigarettes
Christ
Yeah
At least she's alive
see people get killed every day
Worse yet, tortured first and then killed
The nuns got off easy
Jeez
Cigarette burns
Everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns
'll show you cigarette burns
stubs out his  on the back of his hand
He does the move with intensity and bravado
responds by calmly doing the same
But she does it entirely impassively, and rubs the  into her flesh longer than  did

Do you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God

Of course he is
You know that
Yeah
Yeah

Right
hangs up, thinks  won't resurface the God Question
does, even as she gives him head
Every time she speaks, she pulls away and it frustrates him
This dialectic continues throughout the scene
Do you believe in God
thinks about it, even as  gets him hotter and hotter
The Church is a fucking racket know how they operate
've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head
My Aunt Lu says  was crying all the way through
Yeah, know their game inside out
Now 'm free of it and 'm gonna stay that way
'm not talking about the fucking Church
Fuck the Church
But tell me
Do you believe in God
What's to believe
That Jesus Christ was the Son of God and he came to die for your sins
can't respond
He's distracted by his own pleasure
does something  that causes  sudden pain
cries out
Snaps to attention
Looks at
Your sins, Lieutenant

Where do you think all this shit came from
gives him head again
is more excited now than before she hurt him

It has been two days since my last confession
Father, my sin is a terrible sin
sin of omission
There was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin  think was graver stil
Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning
expected that you would want to speak to me about it
But you could have come to my office
Your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong

If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of
curiosity or even
pleasure, you mustn't -- The
At first, it sounds like crying

Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No
have sinned
And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me
Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God
It's funny, you knew
But the first thing  think of is kneading the bread that  help bake for the soup kitchen
Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt
also thought of that bread, Father
And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and  kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist
Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God
think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer
As  have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin
You see, Father -- Yes, Sister
Yesterday morning, God gave me but one chance to use something else to serve Him
Not my arms or my legs, but something  used for the first time, for the last time, and will never use again

reacts to the explicit word
Shock
Titillation and fascination
Those boys, those sad, raging boys
They came to me as the needy do
And like many of the needy, they were rude
Like all the needy, they took
And like all the needy, they needed
(beat) Father
knew them; They learn in our school
And play in our schoolyard
And they are good boys
You knew them
(beat) Who were they, Sister
Who are these boys
What are the names of these -- good boys you knew
Outside the ,  stiffens
This could be the clue he needs to solve the case
could tell you their names now, and  know you'd be bound by a sacred vow to keep my secret
But  cannot tell you their names
For , too, am bound
As  am bound now to confess my sins
So listen, Father Listen
(beat) am a nun
What did  give those boys that they could not have found elsewhere
Nothing
Nothing at all
There were always two of us in the act
The act was half my own
It does not seem to me the act was half the act of a once of Christ
(beat) It is the lost chance that will remain on the ledger of my sins
Not the loss of my virginity
The rape forced upon me a choice
As a vessel of the spirit
could have imbued my vagina with God
Or,  could have turned away from God and voided my body of spirit, so that all that was left for those boys was a lump of flesh
chose the second path
The easier, path
The path of the material world
The path no nun has the right to take
And so,  sinned
(beat) My vagina spread, but spread no word
It opened, on nothingness
It gave nothing at all and left nothing behind

Something divine
His silent reactions embody both decadence and awe
This apparent paradox can find unified expression in his character, though at other moments it threatens to tear him apart
The tension between the two polarities will propel him toward his destiny
Jesus turned water to wine
ought to have turned bitter semen to fertile sperm -- hatred to love
And maybe to have saved their souls
They did not love me
ought to have loved them
As Jesus loved those who reviled him
ought to have surprised those boys
Instead, they surprised me, and got no surprise at all
No, they did not rape a nun
But a nun has been raped
And the nun must now atone for her sin
For a God-given part of her was wasted
part which other women use for procreation, for conjugal fulfillment, for expressions of love
had but one chance
And did nothing but react in pain
(beat) When those boys placed their hands upon my breasts, they had nothing but an assortment of skin cells in their grasp
They ought to have felt, through me
The bosom of their Redeemer
When they lay on top of me and looked down into my eyes, they saw fear
They should have met the eyes of a lover, And felt the presence of the Prince of Peace
(beat) My vagina
shall never have again
And never again shall  encounter two boys whose prayer was more legible, more poignant, more anguished
Two young men who threw themselves upon the altar and took me with them
And  did nothing for them

Worst of all, why can't  feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head
Why do  have to know, over and over, that it was you
You who died; died for my sins
And that  will die for nothing
Why
kneels down, knee to knee, face to face with
forgive you
Why do  dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to death
And why have  never forgotten that if she, then  -- averts his eyes
When he looks up again -- is back on the
Inert, and yet -- rises, moves around the interior of the
He stumbles, struggles, pleads
Falls, rises, falls and rises again -- as if wrestling with an invisible assailant
He collapses in a corner
Oh God, my God
it's goddamn good to be good
Forgive me
Father, for have sinned
It's still goddamn good to be good
forgive you
In the aftermath of his revelation, he notices, cleanly, a hunched,    carrying something toward the He staggers toward her
Yes
The    has the grabs the
The    doesn't let go
The chalice
Tell me
Who gave it to you

At first, she doesn't speak at all

My husband will give me Hell, Mister
We've already got Hell, Sister
She meets 's eyes, seems to understand something
Calmly, she tells him what he needs to know
It's very hard
He's a -- you're not a cop, are you
No
Not a cop
My husband is a fence
He got this chalice from a couple of kids
Just yesterday,  think
stole it out of his shop so as to return it to where it ought to be
It's a holy thing, you know

It's as if he expected them
You took the chalice
Yes
You brought it back to the Church
And then it made it's way back to me, again
Yes
Th  bursts out
Are you all right, honey
was gonna bring it back myself
The    is obviously relieved
Jesus, woman
What did you think
You thought 'd get mad like  did that time you took that set of pots and pans
That was twenty years ago
And how do you compare pots and pans and a chalice
speaks up suddenly
They both hold stuff you eat
After a beat, the  and his  start
joins in
(to ) So what are you doing here
He wants to know who brought in the chalice
That's no mystery
Julio and Paolo brought it in, (beat) You don't want to hurt those boys, do you
mean, they sure as Hell have got something coming, but it ain't what the Law wants to give them
You understand
(beat -- shakes his head) No
How could you understand
The  seems to study

Wretched
The  thinks again
Well -- maybe you do
But  don't know where those boys are at right now
You'll have to ask around
Those boys on the corner'll know
You'll have to get it out of them
But they know

No one knows anything
stops people at random, getting really desperate
He shows people the , asks them if they've seen it before
No one has
plays both  and  as it suits his needs
By now, he looks more like a homeless man than anything else
But none of his play-acting or lethal threats get him anywhere
The  is everywhere, and the Mets are still losing
Finally,  approaches a hustling
He cops
The   is wearing a , so the deal goes down in mime
Now,  speaks and wants to be heard
Hey -- Have you seen Paolo or Julio around
The   uses his  and the resulting "deafness" to excuse his total lack of response
starts   silently at the
No response
Then, he -- silently -- begins to shout
The  's alarmed that he seemingly can't hear at all above the  music
He moves the  away from his ears but doesn't take it off
What the fuck you want
You know, my Uncle used to wear a walkman all the time
The walkman looked just like yours
And you look something like my Uncle
But one day he was standing in a puddle -- the puddle locked just like that one -- points to a  in which the   is now Standing
And what
And he got electrocuted
The   tries to consider what this crazy guy has just told him, but before the   can even react
leans in on him, shows his  and then his
Look --  don't know you, and you don't know me, but 'm really in the mood to kill someone today and you are at the end of my gun
(beat) Have you ever had days like that
Yeah, you have, so now you understand where 'm coming from
(beat) Tell me
Where is Julio and Paolo
The   answers with absolute ease
That was all it was about
No problem
