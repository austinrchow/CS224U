Thirty year old    is in the backseat
He nods
His arms are behind him
We don't know why
Red starts the car and drives forward
: ,  ,  - Its cold
-Convicts' uniforms are broadly striped and frayed
This is a line of hard men branded by prison: shorn hair, broken nose, eyes with a cold ferocity
And their aggression has a nihilistic edge; their spirits never surrender
There's nothing beaten down about these men
Like Alcatraz, Leavenworth, and Sing Sing, this is the end of the line
in visored black caps, black shirts, black patent leather Sam Browne belts with three-foot long billy clubs watch the line, poised to unleash violence
""  (32), 6 foot 1 with eerie blue eyes
Brilliant, violent, he hates all authority
( 44), squat with an anvil jaw, facial scars and as calm as Pierpont is volatile
(27), tall, an incorrigible clown and an unemotional killer
He has continued to ridicule guards even when it cost him months in the hole

Hamilton flashes the badge
He shoves Dillinger inside

That's right
But my friends call me "Johnnie"

Dillinger's insubordination puzzles Turnkey so he doesn't see Hamilton bat a Thompson submachine gun across the back of his head and swing it onto the Two Guards

He crosses the front lawn, the street car tracks
So far, so good

() : This Guard gives Shouse an insolent look
Shouse slams the Guard's head with a length of steel pipe
Guard goes down
Shouse goes wild and continues to hammer his skull again and again, caving it in
Cut it out Shouse

So, he grabs for Homer Van Meter's

Dillinger falls away
Dillinger and Pierpont grab Walter's arms
He's-paralyzed now
They try to pull him onto the running boafd, of the moving car
Dietrich's"hcpeful eyes look up at them
Then his eyes glaze over
His feet drag down the street
He's dead and they know it
They let go
- ' body remains in the center of the street
The Pontiac picks up speed
- drives like he has no nerves
Totally focused
Hamilton is the best getaway, or "git" driver in the country
' Thompson empty, he grabs Red's shotgun
He shoves it into Shouse's chest in the backseat
Walter's dead 'cause you screwed it up, you son of a bitch
The bastard wouldn't do what he was told, Johnny

: Let him have it
Dietrich was your pal, up to you
Dillinger sees the abject fear in Shouse's eyes
And Dillinger's mood swings
He lowers the shotgun
Then, he snaps the butt across Shouse's face
Breaks Shouse's cheekbone
Dillinger pulls back and slams the heavy butt dead center, smashing Shouse's nose and orbital socket
Dillinger opens the door and kicks Shouse out of the moving car

Grateful, Norris goes inside, Dillinger passes Viola and the struggling toddler on the way to the Pontiac, () Take me with you, mister
She puts a hand on his forearm

Pierpont, Homer and Makley head towards the Plymouth

And so in the middle of a Great Depression you're looking for a budget increase to build up your Department
But by my tally your Department of Investigation spends more taxpayer's dollars catching crooks than what the crooks you catch stole in the first place
That's ridiculous

You have never personally conducted a criminal investigation in the field in your life= Others in the room stare at Hoover
McKellar leans'-back

think your prowess as a lawman is a myth created from a hoopla of headlines by Mr
Suydam, your publicist there
You are trying to make a federal police force with you set up as its Czar
That is runnin' wild in my estimation
Crime is what runs wild in this country, Mr
Chairman

And he didn't expect to be overcome by doubt
He struggles with anxiety
Then, he pushes that aside and forces himself to take the step forward into the lights and flashbulbs

She lights up a ro om
She is (27)
She feels the stare and looks over
She studies him, then looks away
Dillinger's with Pierpont, Makley and Hamilton at a table

Dillinger adjusts his chair to watch for the girl
He's shoulder to shoulder to Karpis
Hiya, Alvin
You hungry
How's Freddie and Dock

He will outlive everyone, including
Edgar Hoover, and retire to Torremolinos, Spain, where he will die of heart failure in 1979

() Well, we got a mail train we been lookin' at, too
Say, by the way, if someone got pinched here, who can get'em out real fast
Lawyer named Piquett

Dillinger looks at Karpis
In 2007, that would be $22 million

Where you gonna go
Brazil
Cuba, maybe
What about you

We ain't worryin' about tomorrow yet
You ought to

Dillinger looks at Pierpont
Shut your yap, Homer
Let's get our of here
Pierpont, Homer and Makley leave
() 27
: (3) Homer stayin' steady
(reading his mind) He's okay
Three rules  learned from Walter Dietrich
One: never work with people who are desperate
Two: never work with people who aren't the best
Three: never work when you're not ready
Billie reappears, dancing with a young man
Well,  got rule four: stay away from women
Without women,  might as well have `stayed in stir
Anna Sage approaches with a young girl for Red
What's why they invented whores
(getting up) Hamilton leaves, arms around the women
Dillinger keeps his eye on Billie
Music ends
Young man escorts her to her table
He tries to join her
She turns him down
Dillinger finishes his drink, approaches
He now sees how beautiful Billie is
She's 5 foot 5
With a straight erect build, she stands out in any crowd
She looks Dillinger straight in the eye
Clear skin, dark eyes with humor playing about the edges
He unexpectedly starts to feel nervous
He gives her his best grin
don't know what you said to your friend, but  sure am glad you did
Billie looks him over: a well-made man in a good suit with a great smile
And, paradoxes: he easily talks to women but he's not a hustler
He's young, but there's a world of experience in his face
Open, but he's holding something back

She smiles a pretty smile at him
How come you don't know how to dance
Its easy
Follow me
This is a two-step
(he stares at her feet) Don't look at my feet
Look at my shoulders
She stays an inch or two distant in his arms
Its slow and languorous
He follows her with little difficulty
He can smell the perfume in her black hair
() azPack-up all my cares and woe Here  go, singing low Bye, bye blackbird" My, but you are pretty
() 29
: ( 5) They look into each other's eyes
He pulls her closer, wants to kiss her long smooth neck
He almost can't resist
Their lips are an inch apart
And then she rests her cheek on his shoulder and the kiss that wasn't hangs in the air around them
He whispers
(') Where you from, Billie
She turns her right ear towards him
She's deaf in her left ear

On life, meeting someone like you

She laughs at the flattery
Holds his eyes a beat with an ironic look
couple from another group looks at Dillinger
He's cool
He returns the look
They look away

Sure
He nods courteously to her girlfriends, grabs her coat, puts a hand around Billie's waist and steers her out

Dillinger
pulls her close
Then he turns and he kisses her hard on the lips
She didn't expect that
Her eyes are wide
He opens and wraps her in his overcoat, their bodies close to each other
She kisses him back, long and deep
And she didn't expect to do that, either
At last they separate
and look at each other for a beat
-  ' - Dillinger slips him bills
He and Billie are shown to a table
The clientele is North Shore old money and businessmen
Some of the women are in dazzling dresses even though it's mid-Depression
few stare at Billie
She's out of her class
What are you gonna have
() 31
: Billie stares at him, ignoring her menu
What is it, exactly, you do for a living
Dillinger looks over the top of his menu
Well
rob banks
Then he leans back in his chair and regards her
(') That's where all these people here put their money
Why'd you tell me that
You could have made up a story
'Cause  can't lie to you
she studies him carefully

at's a pretty serious thing to say to a woman you just met

Well,  haven't been any of the places you've been
So  don't even know what don't know
Some of the places  been ain't so hot
Where 'm going is a lot better
Wanna come along
Boy, you are in a hurry
If you were looking at what  am looking at, honey, you'd be in a hurry too
She laughs at his flattery, which she is also finding persuasive
() 32
: ( 2) (leans in) Well, its me they're looking at this time
That's 'cause you're beautiful
blonde woman, elegant and ice cold, stares at Billie, a Depression-era child in her dress
That's nice
But they're looking at me because they're not used to having a Menominee Indian girl in their restaurant in a three dollar dress
(takes her hand) Listen, doll, that's 'cause they're all about where people come from
Only thing important is where somebody's going
Where are you going
To the top
He's irresistible
(' ) Let's get out of here

She nods
They get up, get their things
On their way
a man intercepts Dillinger
He is (42), solid with big hands
He's smiling
() Hey Johnny

'll be right there
Billie turns and walks out of the restaurant

We're connected to everybody all over the country now
From Nitti's table a man gets up and walks straight towards Dillinger
He is  '
Two heavy duty bodyguards are with him
Dillinger unbuttons his jacket

How did we find Berman
Dillinger's coat was bought in Cicero, Illinois, a few doors from Berman's dealership
Berman supplies cars to the syndicate
Since Capone
Dillinger must have been at Berman's switching cars when he bought that coat
() Soon as they call to switch out the next car, we will tail them
Right to Dillinger

Billie checks their hats and coats
To Dillinger
(without looking up) May  check your coat, sir
No, honey
You go get your coat
She looks up
So does May
May flashes Billie a look: if you don't want him,  do
Sounds good to me
Dillinger has eyes only for Billie
You ran out on me
`you left me standing alone on the sidewalk

" Say it
() 36
: ( 2) No
Well,  will never run out on you
And that's a promise
Well,  want to run out of here
So, lady, will you get my coat
Dillinger lifts the man two feet off the floor and slams him into the wall
Real jailhouse rage
The lethally cold eyes tells the customer everything he needs to know
Dillinger swings him to the counter, grabs the man's ticket, slams thru the half door, finds the man's coat, tosses it at him
Keep the tip
(to Billie) You ain't getting other people's hats and coats no more either
He takes her coat and holds it for her
She doesn't move
No one's ever done that for me before
You're with me now

She gets into her coat
Dillinger opens the door for her
They exit, watched by May

It's large, low-ceilinged, luxurious and modern --- Billie is bowled over
He sits her down on a sofa

From a back bedroom (Red's) a phonograph is louder as a door opens and Red enters the kitchen in a robe for a drink
He returns
Laughter
Dillinger has the boxes and drinks

Billie opens the boxes
She lifts out a sleeveless dress in dusty pink
It is beautiful
She is very touched

That what you want to know
'm trying to get to know you
You want to get to know me
, '  - Dillinger is an uninhibited and enthusiastic lover
They pause
He falls over onto his back and pulls her onto his chest and they look up out the window through the upside down elm trees to the Chicago moon in the cold sky
() 38
: She gets up and wanders around the room
He thinks she's the most beautiful creature he's ever seen
She's looking at his stuff
She sees suitcases that are packed, ready to leave in a heartbeat
Everything's so neat
She touches his folded shirt
smooth Egyptian cotton
Since we been out  go for the finest stuff
As much as  can get, as fast we can get it

You're all packed
Always are
Ready to get up and go in a heartbeat

He pulls her down next to him
She turns her good ear towards him
(') What's wrong with the other ear
was married once
He was too handy with his fists
She stares at Dillinger
Will this put him off
Where's he now
In prison
divorced him
Only mistake made was marrying him in the first place
He got caught mugging a mailman
criminal mastermind
() 39
: (2) She turns over and puts her mouth next to his ear
It gets amorous through
After my daddy died, we went to live on the reservation in Flandreau
In Flandreau nothin' ever happened
() When  was 13, we went to live with my Aunt Ines in Milwaukee where my cousin Frances had a lot of Indian friends who went around to churches and put on plays like "Little Fireface
" And nothing exciting ever happened to me there, either
So  haven't been anywhere or done anything in my whole life except come to Chicago and try to make my way
Well baby-you're going to start a new and exciting kind of life from right now
And as they're pulled to each other and start making love again, she stops

To please you
That's not what she meant, but gently, he rolls her over on the bed

(on his feet) Your honor
Are we to have a hearing in accord with the laws of this nation, or is the State to be permitted to incite an atmosphere of prejudice
The very air reeks with the bloody rancor of intolerant malice
The clanging of shackles brings to our minds the dungeons of the Czars, not the flag-bedecked liberty of an American courtroom request the court to direct that those shackles be removed forthwith

Sheriff Holley,  think it's a very nice jail you have right here
What makes you think there's anything wrong with it
There isn't anything wrong with my jail
It's the strongest jail in Indiana
That's what  thought
But of course, don't want to embarrass Mrs
Holley appreciate that she's a woman and if she's afraid of an escape

Okay, Dillinger will stay here

The Defense will need four months to prepare itself
It should take 10 days
To go on trial in 10 days would be a legal lynching of this lad
There's a law against lynching
There's a law against murder
Then observe the law part
Or just stand Dillinger against the wall and shoot him
Then, there's no need to throw away the State's money on this mockery

() 118
: () There's a sweaty little man that keeps asking when the movie's gonna end
across the street, there's three, four men and there's two more around the corner-why are they wearing suitcoats on such a hot night
Pretend like nothing's going on
He leaves the booth, taking the cash receipts
'  - on the phone
'  (
) District 37, Sheffield Avenue
Get some detectives over here, this is Charlie Shapiro at the Biograph
They're gonna stick us up again
'  (
) How do you know, Charlie
see them getting in position, like they're waiting 'til the movie's over
- The alley suddenly is illuminated by headlights from two directions
rear door opens and before the car stops, a has stepped off the running board with his sawed-off shotgun in Agent Suran's face
Wait, wait
Hold it
Federal Agent
/
Before you shoot him, get his
Who the hell are you
Department of Justice
Bureau of Investigation
() 119
: What do you think you're doing here
Were on a federal stakeout
Put that gun down and back those cars out of the alley
But stay close because we may need you
You may need us
" Fuck you, college boy
Let's see your goddamn badge
Suran's looking down both barrels
- : love you more than anything, Blackie, you know
She stops
' mesmerized' her eyes and soft skin
We  in his hyper reality thee satin tones on the screen
Myrna Loy's insouciance,;like Billies, speaks to him
Meanwhile
-   + + empty their pockets, trying to identify themselves to who've drawn down on them
Zarkovich starts arguing, not believing this is happening
More Chicago  arrive
Meanwhile
- starts across the street to straighten out the Chicago
Sergeant
While
: - :   ( ) walks the long walk through the cell block
the actual Public Enemy #1 watches the celluloid gangster walk to the electric chair
() 120
: See ya, Blackie
stops at the cell
Die the way you lived
All of a sudden
: ' startle, Is this a message
(') Don't drag it out
speaking these important words
(') that doesn't count for anything
There's no more point to it
: He sees inwards
And he knows it won't happen
Them= no Mexico with Billie
There's no freighter to Manila
- He will die
This day, this month, next month
He knows that in this instant
In this Hollywood version of life, the power of cause and effect operates on the end, as inescapably as gravity
It's a core truth
This is the only end for Blackie Gallagher
And its as true for john Dillinger in his life as it is for Gallagher
Actions and historical forces have made his time be up
Dillinger  the flickering images
His concentration slices time into component parts
Gable exchanges last good- byes
He warns his
friend, Ronald Coleman, not to commute his sentence
The images play on Dillinger's face
They take him over-alone in the packed theater while 25 Federal Agents and five East Chicago cops wait outside
() 121
: (2) enters the execution chamber
: - glances at his watch
He rips a match from the matchbook, ready to light the cigar
The lobby is empty
The dim music of the finale leaks out
-  + wait
Winstead coolly watches Purvis
- ' right hand shakes
He can't control it
He grips the steering wheel to make it stop
- ignores the Chicago detectives
: - looks at the backs of heads in the rows in front of her
She doesn't want to miss Dillinger if he leaves
celiblock
The cellblock lights dim, a convict says
(
) There he goes
They're giving it to him now
: The grin
End title music
People stirring
The house lights come up
Johnny doesn't move
He seems liberated
Released somehow
People in front and behind him start to exit
He sits there, holding onto his thoughts for a moment
: - anxiously scans faces emerging from the theater
- are alert in case Dillinger exits a rear door
122
- ,   + file out
Polly takes his arm
Anna is behind him and off to the side
They're in a loose knot of people
sees him
He lights his cigar
It's the signal to move in
:  + don't see the signal because the Chicago
detective is now shouting at Zarkovich
lights a second match
And as he lights his cigar, he looks up to see
look right at him
Dillinger does not recognize Purvis
- saw the signal
He's out of his car
,  + turn left at the sidewalk heading south, like Winst"ad said
They pass doorways
Reinecke approaches from 20 feet behind
: looks up
sees Dillinger walking away
If Dillinger's taken alive, he's dead
The Chicago cop puts a hand on Zarkovich`s chest
: ,  + down the sidewalk past shadowed doorways
+ () That's Dillinger
Straw hat
Glasses
Hurt crosses the sidewalk in front of Dillinger and walks north
He'll turn and position himself behind Dillinger on the right
These guys are pros
123
- shoves the Chicago Sergeant out of his way and races across the street
- approaches Dillinger from the rear
He's 15 steps behind him
Purvis is ten steps behind Dillinger, on the left close to the wall
Now Purvis reaches for his gun
: draws his weapon
He stares at the back of Dillinger's head
Has getting closer
Sweat runs into Reinecke's eyes
This isn't the firing range with a paper target
This isn't theory
This is the beast
The beast is a gunfighter
The beast is better than you
You beat-up his girl
Your shot will miss
now passerWinstead in the doorway
Purvis is raising his 9mm Browning
Reinecke stalls
He doesn't want to be first
steps out f, the doorway, now, and falls in up the center of the sidewalk
Reinecke's eyes are riveted on Dillinger
senses something
: '  +   - Subconsciously his brain processes what his peripheral vision took in that his intuitive defenses don't like about this landscape
He turns
Reinecke's hand holding the gun is frozen in the air
He's paralyzed
He lacks the power to pull the trigger
' There's the man who slammed Billie into that car
Dillinger's lethal intent focuses on this one target
In milliseconds
() 124
: turning towards Reinecke
Reinecke has hijacked his attention
Dillinger hasn't picked up the others
pulls the trigger
Nothing
He left the safety on
He fumbles with it
--halt
sees all of them
He pushes the
380 in towards Purvis
and bumps into a pedestrian named Ella Natasky
starts to fall
Dillinger turns his attention to her for a millisecond
He's a gentleman
His impulse is to reach for her to steady her
shoves aside the paralyzed Reinecke, pushes past Purvis, leans forward and shoots John Dillinger in the back of the head
The heavy 45 round punches through Dillinger's,brain stem and exits underneath his right eye
John Dillinger stumbles into the alley opening and starts to fall
second shot from Winstead and two more from Clarence Hurt hit him now
They don't matter
falls through the air
:  ' crashes into the
One lens of his eyeglasses breaks
The brim of his straw hat snaps
The hat falls away
He struggles, but can't move
He breathes
He tries to speak
stands over him
Purvis snatches the
380 automatic out of Dillinger's hand
sees Dillinger's trying to say something
() 125
:( 2) ' try to form speech and Winstead's ear is next to his mouth
We and Winstead hear
tell Billie
Only Charles Winstead hears the rest
unloads Dillinger's gun
His gun-handling of Dillinger's gun is a lot better than his gun-handling of his own under stress
What did he say
couldn't hear him
You look after this
need to call Washington
Zarkovich`houlders through the gathering crowd of s=and newsmen, sees the head wound, the glazing over of Diflinger's eyes
He knows he's safe
' get dreamy, then they seem to focus far away
Then they seem to focus not at all
(') Cover his face and keep the damn photographers away
: Purvis starts away and we  the Biograph marquee, the trolley tracks in the cobblestone street, the alley, and the hundreds of people moving towards the locus of the dead John Dillinger
: 126
( ) -  - watches Tolson who is at the window
Tolson gets a sign
Hoover straightens his collar
He brushes lint off his pants leg
Tolson waits
Hoover waits
- opens
Alvin Karpis comes out
In the hot, humid New Orleans air, his suit coat is off
he carries it under his arm
He crosses the street towards his Lincoln Coupe
His eyes land on a man on a bench across the street looking at him over a newspaper
And while crossing the street, Alvin slows down
The newspaper hides a sawn-off, 10 gauge Winchester lever action shotgun
: leans on a lamp post
His body hides a 351 Winchester rifle
freezes
He doesn't hesitate
He opens his hands to demonstrate he is holding nothing and lets his jacket; fall to the ground
He knows instantly who they are and that
,,they intend to kill him
Karpis' eyes dart to the roofto isA
Snipers on both
In this instant, Karpis knows he is done
One objective races into his mind: stay alive
' stretches out his arms, wide
Winstead has dropped the newspaper
The sawed-off 10 gauge is aimed squarely at Alvin's chest
Karpis is displaying he is unarmed
Winstead approaches warily step-by-step
His weapon would cut Alvin in half
Clarence, the rifle at his shoulder, inches forward
The ex-Texas Ranger gunfighters with real trigger-time have taken Alvin Karpis
am unarmed
Don't even breathe sudden
+ are 10 feet from him
Clarence pats him down
Karpis is clean
() 127
: The Texans cover Alvin and move him to the sidewalk near his car
Put your hands on the roof of that Lincoln
(he does) Other agents come running in
Someone's yelling: We got him
We got him
Bring him in
" While they wait
Where you from
Canada, but mostly Chicago
(to both) You
Fort Worth, thereabouts
Clarence is from Tyler
() Well, Alvin
You're a sly old dog
If ,you'd a even had that jacket on
ring ofc tints with their revolvers out, now converge around Karpis
(to Agent) Any handcuffs around here
They don't have any
They had not planned on needing them
One agent is excited
His gun pointed at Karpis shakes
Mind asking that man to
(to Agent) Put that down
The agent drops his gun
- in his white suit and Tolson rush in from the dry cleaners where they were stashed
The agents part
They suddenly stand in front of Alvin Karpis
Hoover's 38 Chief Special is at his side
() 128 : () "You are under
You are under arrest for the
Wahpeton, South Dakota bank robbery
Tolson waves to an agent across the street
:  + are now released and rush towards us
regains his composure
(') heard of your fishing prowess
i myself, always wanted, to catch a marlin
You're thinking of my partner, Harry Campbell
Are you relieved its over
'm sure you are
() You know you will feel much better once you get everything off your chest
() Why don't you tell me where Harry Campbell is
After a moment
Who do you think you're talking to
Hoover is silent
(to Winstead) There's no handcuffs
Give me your tie
+ () 129
: ( 2) Hoover separates from Karpis
Mr
Hoover
Director
Karpis said he'd never be taken alive, but  took him without firing a shot
() That marks him as a yellow rat
He was scared to death when  arrested him
() That's all  got to say
Suydam and the special publicist,   address the reporters
'll answer any questions
#1 Mr
Hoover captured Karpis
Mr
Hoover personally placed Alvin Karpis = eier arrest today
Karpis reached for a rzf le, but the Director was too fast
: '   -   - waits
It looks like he's been waiting for awhile
People who pass act as if he is invisible
They look right through him
The Director will see you now
'  -  - Purvis stands in front of the desk
On the right of the desk is a plaster death mask of John Dillinger
(without looking up) Agent Purvis
Yes sir
(sees Purvis stare at death ) () () 130
: (') medical student in the morgue made that cast of Dillinger's face
It's a reminder of the war we continue to wage against the punks and hoodlums
Purvis looks at Hoover
This was the golden boy who Hoover came to despise
One thing  learned was that John Dillinger was an outlaw and my Adversary
But he was no punk
And he was no hoodlum
() Another is that  have no future in your Bureau
And  don't desire one
quit
Purvis tosses his badge on Hoover's desk and walks out
Hoover couldn't care less
'  -   - and fall   onto the face of Charles Winstead
He waits
- is in an interview cell
-   ' in prison issue shoes down the cellblock corridor
It is Billie Frechette
She walks with two guards behind her
- Billie enters
She's surprised to see Winstead
How are you doing, Billie
() If you come here to ask me more damned questions
"Where's this one or that one
Did  know Vern Miller
Who did what
" Winstead shakes his head no
() 131
: didn't come here for you to tell me something
came here to tell you something
: She sees in Winstead's face, the look of people she grew up with
Billie senses none of the cunning of the lawyer/special agents she's been dealing with
She leans forward, indicates a cigarette out of Winstead's pocket
He hands her one and lights it
Okay, Mr
Winstead
What do you got to tell me
Winstead leans forward
(') () They say you're the man who shot him
''at's right
One of them
6 why are you coming here to see me
To see the damage you done
Because he asked me to
This gets Billie's attention and she looks more closely at Winstead
(') When he went down, he said something
And put my ear next to his mouth and what think he said was this
He said
() "
tell Billie for me
Bye Bye Blackbird
" Billie has to rise and turn away from Winstead so that he doesn't see her overcome with emotion
Winstead knows this
It is the measure of this man that he respected the privacy of John Dillinger's message and only told her
