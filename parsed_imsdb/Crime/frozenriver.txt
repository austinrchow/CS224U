Her breath is visible in the cold morning air
Her bare feet rest on the cold ground
Her 1970's rusted out    in front of her on

Around her, the yard is littered with junk: a rusted ski lift chair, the front end of a Plymouth Duster and a Kiddie Ride
Beyond the yard, flat, winterbare land
After a moment, a lanky boy of 15, her son, ,
, leans out the trailer door
We're out of Capt'n Crunch
His breath is visible in the cold
Just give him toast

We got no butter, we got no jelly
Ray is out of ideas
He expects her to move, but she stays still
He looks around the yard

Listening for the trucks
Are they really coming
Yeah
Where's dad
She is silent

That was stupid
Yeah,  see that now, but the trucks were coming before the bank opened

Did you tell him you had it
Duh
No,  guess he just sniffed it out
Jesus Christ
The glove compartment
That's the stupidest place you could have put it
He hasn't bought a scratch card in almost thirty two months
thought it would be okay
Did he leave anything
She shakes her head

Nothing
You could look for him
He could be anywhere
We should look for him

What do you mean
just can't do it anymore
But he'll lose it all

He stole our money

It's not stealing if you take it from your family
Anyway, he made some of it, too
So you're just gonna sit there

Ray hears it
It gets louder
Another Christmas in the tin crapper
goes into the shed and slams the door
Ray throws down her cigarette and goes into the trailer

'  -                                       4 She looks around the cramped trailer at the oversized furniture including a big screen
An enlarged wall photograph of the family catches her eye
In it, her husband, ,
, 40, wearing a forced smile, his long, shaggy hair combed flat for the picture
Ray hurries down the hall to her bedroom and takes off her bathrobe -- she has several tatoos -- and slides into a pair or jeans and a t-shirt
5
sleepy-eyed, toe-headed boy, , 5, walks in, shirtless in pajama bottoms, eyes shining
Is it here
Ray stops what she's doing when she sees him and kneels down
Hey, little sleepy head
Is it here yet
`Cause 'm ready
He drags a suitcase full of plastic dinosaurs around the corner
The
Ricky  out of the bedroom and down the hall to the trailer door
Wait a sec- He bursts into the yard where: 5

Ricky stops at the massive sight, twisting at his fly, trying not to pee himself
comes out of the shed
The Doubles come to a stop and idle in the yard
, pot-bellied, in a green velour running suit, squeezes out of his truck
On the door: " ,
" Ricky grabs a rope hanging off one of the doubles and tries to climb the side of it
The   looks down from his cab

Ray peeks out the kitchen curtain

After a moment she comes out of the trailer, with a pasted-on smile
We're all ready for ya'
She points to the new concrete foundation
He consults a clipboard
We'll need the balloon payment to unload
looks at Ray
We have it, it's just that they called Troy from Titus last night
That's where Troy works
The ski place
And anyway- Have you got the $4,372 dollars or not
It was some emergency with the lifts
So he took off without thinking with the money
Completely forgot you were coming
So as soon as he gets back- When's he gonna be back
As soon as he can get here, 'll just run it down to you
could crawl out of his skin
(ironic smile) This is the second time you've dragged me out here
If you don't come up with it by Christmas, you've lost your fifteen hundred dollar deposit
He walks toward his car
She follows him
Look, Mr
Versales,  have a good job at They're probably gonna make me a manager after Christmas so can handle the payments if you just leave the house- 7
He gets in the car
Call me when you have the balloon payment
He makes a circle in the air with his hand and the semi's rev their engines and grind into reverse
'll call you
Her voice is   by  engines
Ricky rushes to her
Wait, where are they going
She takes his face in her hands
Listen to me
We'll get them back
But why are they leaving
Ricky, 'll get them back
promise, honey
That's our house
He   from her and  down the road chasing after the semis
Ray chases after Ricky until he runs out of steam and stops, panting
She catches up to him and tries to hug him
He pushes her away
She gets down on her knees and takes his face in her hands
We're gonna get it back
She picks him up and walks back to the trailer
Ricky looks out mournfully at the trailers disappearing down the road
(') (to
) You better hurry or you're going to miss the bus
Let's get your clothes on, Ricky

just stares at her

You're 15,
They won't ask any questions
You're finishing school
Come on, you don't think we can live on what you make at All for a Dollar do you
You're going to school

Where's daddy
Ray and
look at each other
He'll be back
Aren't we even gonna look for him
No
'm going to work and you're going to school
That's it

The only thing that changed is that your dad started gambling again
Everything else is the same
Where did he go
He had to take a business trip
rolls his eyes
Aren't you even gonna look for him
And miss a day of work
No
Not again
We just have to live our lives
Now go get your backpack

(') Go on
When is daddy coming home

can't believe you're not even gonna look for him
Where
Where do  look
(He can't answer) The reservation
told you, he could be in Atlantic City by now
She helps Ricky get his backpack on and gives him a kiss
(shakes his head) The glove compartment
That's so stupid
You're going to school
10
He follows Ricky out the door to catch the school bus rolling up out front
Suddenly, Ray remembers: (') Wait, wait
They turn around
She digs in her pockets
(') Here
Lunch money
They take it and keep running for the bus
Ray looks after them and reaches for her cigarettes
She takes out her second to last one
She lights it and takes out her mascara
She tries to put it on the bathroom mirror, but her tears keep getting in the way

Could  talk to you
He looks at her

Matt blinks with a blank expression then: see you as a short timer
What is that
short timer
Not here for long, not really committed
Ray follows him to the stock room
11
When  started you said it would be six months before  could come on full-time
And that was two years ago
He opens a can of   and takes a sip
It's my opinion
Well,  mean, you know,  do show up
Pat's late everyday
She's late now
She's always late
He stares blankly at her
She can think of nothing else to say
He walks out
Ray resumes unpacking ponies
moment later , 22, rushes in, looking sorry
As Pat hangs up her coat, Ray glimpses a tatoo just above her low riding pants with the words "How You Doin'

Ray takes the last of her cigarettes out of the pack and heads out the back door

It is empty flat land but for a few trailer homes and barns
She passes a lonely sign: "
" Up ahead another sign: "
" From the car, the Reservation consists of shabby houses with no siding, tax-free gas stations and dive bars with homemade signs
Ray slows a little to check out the parking lots scanning for her husband's car
Up ahead she sees a sign: " 9

Fill it up
She rolls down the window, digging for change under the seat of her car
She counts it out
Just three
uh, no
two seventy one, two, three, four
Two seventy four
He nods and goes to the pump
She finds a wadded up five dollar bill
(yells out window) Make that seven seventy four
She spots a sign for "" bus in the window
(') Did you see a Blue Acclaim come in here last night
Blue Acclaim
no, but  only worked until 9
You can ask inside
Ray glances inside at the mostly empty restaurant but for a few older Mohawk women
No, that's okay
Did you want to support our Mosquito Lacrosse League
It teaches basic Lacrosse skills to the kids three to five
Ray shakes her head
(') Thanks, anyway
Have a good day

At the end of a row she spots it: a
Ray abruptly turns in
11
-                   11 Ray pulls up alongside the Acclaim and recognizes it by the "  " bumper sticker
She gets out and looks inside
There is a small plastic - Rex on the floor of the backseat
She leans against the car for a moment
Thank you
Oh God, thank you, thank you thank you
After a moment Ray looks up at the Bingo Palace and heads for the entrance

Sunrise session is almost over
Next session starts at 10:30
just need to look inside
Ray starts to walks toward the door and the ticket taker sticks out her foot
It's $5 dollars for admission
14
don't want to play,  just need to look around for a second
'm gonna need the five
'll stand right here at the door won't even go inside
just need to see if my husband's in there
You still gotta pay admission
He's gambling away the money for our house
What does he look like
Long brown hair
Tall
Skinny
Ponytail
He's not in there
Can  just look
told you, lady, he's not in there
Ray walks away
The ticket taker watches her
13
,   -                 13 Ray walks out of the front entrance back across the parking lot toward the Horizon through rows of cars
Across the parking lot,  , 20, a Mohawk girl with long black hair bursts out of the "Employees Entrance" and hurries across the parking lot pulling off her scratch card apron as she walks
Ray catches sight of her, but before Ray reaches the Horizon, Lila reaches the , Hey
15
But Lila drives off
Ray  back in the Horizon and
14
-                                 14 Ray follows the Acclaim down Route 37 and catches sight of it turning off on a dirt road
Ray makes the corner just in time to catch sight of the Acclaim bouncing off on a path through the woods
Ray follows it through the woods to a clearing: the Acclaim stops in front of a rusted out
Lila gets out
Ray pulls up behind her and rolls down her window
That's my car
Lila  around
Huh
(points to the Acclaim) What are you doing with my car
Lila fingers the keys in her hand
That
found it
You stole it
The keys were in it
So you just took it
Lila goes in the bubble camper and shuts the door behind her
Ray gets out of the Horizon and walks up to the camper door and takes out her cell phone
(') We'll just see what the troopers say about that
16
(
) (From inside camper) Go ahead, they got no jurisdiction here
This is Mohawk territory
Ray stops dialing closes up her phone, then goes to her car and takes the gun and goes back to the camper
(knocks with the gun) You can cut the bullshit and give me my keys now
There is no reponse
Ray waits for a moment and then: (') (low voice) Troy, are you in there
There is no response
(') If you're in there you better come out
15
'  -                                     15 Lila sits on an army cot in the dingy camper next to a lamp on the floor
Her clothes are scattered among empty Pringles cans
(
) (tentative, controlled) Troy
Versales says as long as we get the money in by Christmas we won't lose the deposit
(pause)  think we need to talk about this, so come on out
(Pause) Troy
Troy

'  -                                     17 The shock of the blast throws Lila off the cot
She looks at the

18
'  -                                    18 Keeping behind the door for cover, Lila opens it
Ray looks inside: there is no sign of Troy
(from behind the door) The Tribal police don't like people shooting holes in other people's houses
Ray looks at her
This is New York State so quit the bullshit and give me my damn keys
Lila throws the keys out the door
Ray picks them up off the ground
Lila shuts the door with her foot
19
'  -                                    19 Ray gets in the Horizon and pulls it in behind the Acclaim then digs in the trunk, pulling out a rope
She ties one end to the Acclaim's back fender and the other to the Horizon's front fender
Lila watches out the camper window
Ray gets in the Acclaim and starts it up slowly the Horizon a few feet before the rope
Ray gets out and looks at the broken rope
She begins digging in the trunk for more rope
Lila opens the camper door and looks at the bullet hole
This camper belongs to my brother in law
He won't like this
(over her shoulder) Then you should quit stealing cars
thought it was abandoned, the guy driving it got on a bus
Ray stops
Did you see where the bus was headed
18
New York or Buffalo, 'm not sure
Ray - the tow line with the remaining rope
This time the Horizon goes an inch or two before the rope Ray gets out
(under her breath) Shit
Ray  through the trunk for more rope
"Home on the Range" plays on the cell phone in Ray's back pocket
Lila touches the bullet hole in the camper and listens to Ray's conversation from the doorway
Ray puts the phone back in her pocket and takes an old belt of her husbands and tries to attach the fenders of the cars
Ray gets back in the Acclaim and tries  the Horizon once again
This time the right side of the front fender and droops to one side
Ray gets out and looks at Lila
(') 'm not leaving this here
(points at the Acclaim) got a friend who might buy that
It's not for sale
He'll pay more than it's worth
Ray ignores her
(') Maybe two thousand
Why's that
19
He's always looking for cars with button- release trunks
Ray thinks about it
(') He don't need papers or anything
Does he use them to rob banks or something
Lila shrugs
All  know is he pays good for a car like this
Where does he live
Through the woods
Not far
What's in it for you
He'll give me something for finding it
If you try anything, 'm not afraid to use this
Yeah
20
-                  20 Ray drives with one hand and holds the gun with the other
It is pointed at Lila in the passenger seat
Turn up there
Where
Where that stump is
20
Ray makes the turn with one hand and the car bounces through an overgrown path in the woods
Ray reaches the stump
(nervous) There's no road
There's a path
Ray hesitates
(') It's not far
Ray turns and drives into deeper woods
The gun jiggles around in Ray's hand as they bounce along between the trees
Lila tries to ignore it

-                             22 Ray looks out at the ice
Tire tracks make a path across the snow-covered surface between carefully set out Not too fast
There's ruts
'm not crossing that
Don't worry they already put out the Christmas trees
There's no black ice
That's Canada
No, it's Mohawk land
The Rez is on both sides of the river
What about the border patrol
21
There's no border
'm still not crossing that
Don't worry, it'll hold a Plymouth
've seen semis cross it
Ray looks at Lila suspiciously
(') The only other way is the Cornwall bridge and they won't let you take that
(points at the gun)
Suddenly,   driven by a    out of the woods and  around the Acclaim then  out across the ice
(') They plow it and everything
Cautiously, Ray lets off the brake and rolls down the boat ramp towards the smooth surface of the river
(under her breath) This is so fuckin' stupid
Not too fast, there are ruts
23
-                           23 The Acclaim moves across the smooth surface of the river
24
-                           24 Ray stares straight ahead clutching the wheel, barely breathing
Lila glances at the gun in Ray's hand, then out at the river, unfazed
They reach the midpoint of the river and pass it silently
You gotta pick up some speed to get up the bank
22
Ray speeds up
The Acclaim bounces up the steep bank
(') It's just on the other side of those trees
25
/
'  -                25 Ray and Lila pull into a used-car lot surrounded by a chain link fence
There is no sign of life
Ray stops
Honk the horn
Ray honks
Suddenly, from under a gutted truck,    , part wolf,  onto the hood of the Acclaim
Ray is pinned against her seat at the sight of the dog
Lila  the gun out of her hand and points it at Ray
(') Just keep your mouth shut
Ray stares at the snarling dog
(') Just keep it shut
Okay
Ray nods never taking her eyes off the dog
Lila honks the horn again and keeps the gun low and out of sight
Out of the garage comes , 33, a stocky Mohawk, eating a sandwich
Jimmy looks suspiciously at Ray before he sees Lila
Thunder growls
Thunder
The dog  ferociously at Ray
(') Get back under there
Thunder jumps off the hood and disappears back under the trunk
23
Jimmy walks around to the passenger side of the car
Lila rolls down her window
Hi, Jimmy
Jimmy glances at Ray
He don't like whites, Lila
Sorry
And your late
Sorry
shouldn't even be dealing with you
know
Sorry
He hands her a paper bag
Jimmy goes back to the garage and opens the door in cheap jogging suits follow him out, looking around
26
'   -                        26 Lila hands the paper bag to Ray and points the gun at her, keeping it low and out of sight
Count it
What's going on here
Just count it
Ray opens the bag
It's full of cash
All fifties and hundreds
Ray counts it
(') How much is there
24
Twelve hundred
Lila opens the glove compartment and presses the trunk release
Jimmy motions to the Chinese men to get in the trunk
Jimmy shuts it
He taps twice on the hood of the car and walks back to the garage
(to Ray) Let's go
Wait, who the fuck are they
Just back up
'm not moving until those people get out of my trunk
'll give you half
Now let's go
Jimmy turns around, sees the two women arguing and gets suspicious
(') Let's go
'm not taking them over the border
That's a crime
There's no border here
This is free trade between nations
This isn't a nation
Lila jams the gun into Ray's side
(under her breath) Let's go
Jimmy starts back toward the car
Ray puts the car in and backs up

28
-                          28 Ray drives
Lila sits angled toward Ray with the gun trained on her
Why'd your husband leave you
Fuck you
Maybe he wanted a younger women
Ray stares out at the ice
(') That's what usually happens
Ray says nothing
(') never have to worry about that
My husband is dead
Went down in the river on a run
They never found him
Probably tangled in river weeds
She gives Ray a spooky look
(') You better slow down there are ruts out here
You could get stuck in one
Ray speeds up and roars up the boat ramp off the ice skidding a little
29
-                     29 Ray and Lila bounce through the woods with Lila holding the gun, this time
They come to a dirt road then to an intersection with State Route 37

They won't stop you
You're white
Ray keeps going

Pull around back then wait for him to come to the window
Lila keeps the gun low
The Dealer approaches cautiously
(') Roll down your window
He walks up slowly and hands her a brown paper bag
(') Count it
Ray opens the bag and counts out the cash, as before
Twelve hundred

Lila takes the cash from Ray and pops the trunk release
The two Chinese men hurry out
The Dealer ushers them into a Garage

Turn down there
Ray looks at the dirt road leading into the woods
(') Stop here
Ray stops

Ray hesitates
Lila jams the gun in her side
(') Open the door
Ray opens the door
(') Now get out
Ray doesn't move
You can't have my car
Get out
You can't have my car
Lila tries to push Ray out the driver's door with her feet
Ray clings to the steering wheel
28
(') No
Suddenly, Ray grabs Lila by the hair and pulls her head down to the car seat
Lila hits Ray in the head with the gun
(') (gasps) Fuckin' bitch
Bleeding and holding Lila's hair, Ray pries the gun out of Lila's hand
Lila grabs the sack of money, jumps out of the passenger side of the car and takes off into the woods
Ray chases her, but Lila is faster and gets ahead, then disappears into the woods
Ray stops, panting, and wipes the blood from her forehead
(') (calls after her) Little bitch
Ray stares after her for a long moment then gets back in the Acclaim

He doesn't notice Ray
Ray covers over the cut with her hair and gets out and walks up behind him and taps him on the shoulder
He jumps and cuts the flame
told you not to use that thing when 'm not here
If  get it working  can sell it
She looks at the rusted pieces of it
don't care
Don't use that thing when 'm not here

Rentaworld called
They're coming to get the  if you don't pay by four tomorrow
He notices the car
(') Did you find him
No
Where was the car
At the bus stop on the Rez

You don't know that
Yeah, but you could figure it out
Just find out what buses came through last- And then what
Chase him across the country
Miss work
No
What happened to your face
Nothin'
What, did you get in a fight with somebody
It was no big deal
You got in a fight, for real
Some Indian chick tried to steal your Dad's car
30
No way

It doesn't matter
Where's your car
'll get it tomorrow
You left it on the rez
That's so stupid
didn't have a tow rope
still say we go back there and kick some Mohawk ass
Forget it
Did you and Ricky eat
That would be kinda miraculous since there's no food in the house
There's food
Popcorn and Tang
Ray goes towards the trailer
36
-                          36 Lila walks in off the road
, the owner, plays a handheld video game
She looks around the lot
(In Mohawk) Hi, Lila (In Mohawk) Mike
31
She glances at a row of beat used cars
How's life at the Bingo Palace
Good
How's business
Oh, you know, okay
She eyes a Malibu
How much for that one
Come on, Lila
What
've been saving up
You know what
Does Bernie Littlewolf run your whole life
No, but he said not to sell you a car

For you, all  got are two Chevettes,a Horizon and a Civic

Mommy,  was thinking

We just have to make it to my paycheck on Friday
What about Rentacenter
She searches through the couch cushions
What about them
They said they're coming to get the furniture if they don't get a payment by 4 o'clock
You told me that already
She finds change and hands it to him

Who's gonna take care of him
(going out the door) still say we should go back to the rez, get the Horizon and kick some serious butt
goes out the door behind Ricky and slams it in Ray's face
Ray slips into her jeans and goes to the bathroom mirror to put on her mascara
She cakes it on trying to ignore the cut over her eye but keeps looking at it
Finally she stops and stares at herself
: 39
'  -                                     39 Ray pulls up in front of the camper and stops
The Horizon is still there and all is quiet
Ray gets out holding the gun and a long rope goes to the bumper and begins to tie it to the other bumper, looking over her shoulder every once in while at the camper
Once she has tied the cars together she gets back into the Acclaim, but instead of driving off, she just sits there
After a moment, she gets out with the gun and walks up to the camper
The bullet hole in the door has a sock stuffed in it

It's gonna cost me to get that hole fixed

Ray holds up her hair revealing the cut over her eye

'm no criminal
It's not a crime
You people can call it what you want to

36
They stand staring at each other for a long moment, then Ray walks over and unties the rope around the bumpers of the Acclaim and the Horizon
don't usually work with whites
Suit yourself
Ray gets in the driver's side of the Acclaim and starts it
After a moment, Lila gets in the passenger side

Ray smokes with one hand and holds the gun with the other
How many bedrooms

Almost one
Ray looks at her

Stole him

Jimmy walks out to meet them
Lila rolls down her window
Bernie was askin' if 'd seen you

Thanks

Don't worry about it
Jimmy's cell phone rings
This guy's been calling all morning
He's got two up at the Old Casino

An old casino through the woods
They used to have gambling there in the bootlegger days

One carries an envelope
At the sight of Ray and Lila, he stops and says something to the other one
Both turn around and head back to the
The   , a large Quebecois man, wearing a full-length fur coat gets out
They argue
He pulls out a   and motions the men to the Acclaim
What the hell is he doing
Ray reaches for her gun
Keep that thing down
Bruno walks towards the Acclaim
(') Roll down the window and see what he wants
What the hell is going on here
Just roll it down

Bruno stands at Ray's window
Ray slides the gun under her leg and rolls down the window
Bruno hands her a Tim Horton's bag
She takes it
(Quebec-French accent) 'ey don't like de women driver
He hands Ray the envelope of cash
Count it
Ray nervously  the money as the Chinese men shiver outside
Twelve hundred
Lila pops the trunk
Bruno and the Chinese men disappear around the back of the Acclaim
They hear the trunk Bruno comes back to Ray's window and taps on it
Ray looks at Lila
Open it
Ray rolls down the window again
'is will keep d'em from running
He hands her men's shoes and dirty socks
Ray takes the belongings and  up the window and drives away

The socks and shoes are between them
Why would they want to run
To get away from the snakeheads
40
What's that
The snakeheads pay to get them here and then they gotta work off what they owe
How much does it cost
Forty, fifty thousand
Depends where they're coming from
To get here
Sometimes they gotta work for years to pay it off
(disbelief) To get here
No fuckin' way
She gets a whiff of the socks

She throws them into the backseat
They always stink
Two more cars are seen coming toward them on the river

37 -                               49 Ray notices the vehicle
Are they always there
42
Yeah, but they can't stop you unless you give them a reason
Have you ever gotten caught
Once
What happened
They gave me the choice of paying a fine or spending three months in jail
What did you do
paid the fine

But back then it was cigarettes and everybody did it
Some of the troopers were into it, too
Smuggling
Yeah
But when they lowered the tax on cigarettes in Canada most people got out of it and the rest switched over to Chinese

You're welcome

Ray swerves in and jumps out and runs up to the men
It's okay

Two fifty five, right
The men nod, relieved
Ray counts out the money
Ricky bursts out the door and runs towards Ray

Lila perches in a tree nearby with a can of Pringles potato chips dropping every other one on the ground below where a huge  , part wolf, takes his share
46
From the tree Lila looks inside the window of the house where: baby boy, " ," about a year old, bangs his spoon on his high chair tray then throws it down

He throws it again
She knows the game

He bangs his fists on the tray
Lila drinks in the sight
Abruptly, the   and  leans out
Chance
Chance, get in here before you freeze your ass off
The White Dog looks up at Lila who shakes the Pringles can upside down to show it's empty

From a shirt pocket she pulls out a stack of used scratch cards
She throws the shirts in the closet and reaches for her cigarettes

Ricky has wrapped himself in Christmas lights from head to toe, by slowly revolving while holding the strings
Hey

He plugs in the lights and they turn on
Yeah, that's pretty cool
But it's gonna hurt when you sit down
Ricky giggles

The Dealer tries to hustle them to the garage, but they won't be moved
Ray starts to back out, but the Dealer knocks on their window
Ray rolls it down
(heavy accent) They say there's a bag
It was too heavy
We had to unload it
62
The Dealer tells the woman in Urdu
She becomes She grabs Ray through the window and the dealer pulls her off
(') What's the matter with her
She had something in the bag
The woman continues screaming in Urdu

37 -                            79 Lila and Ray pull back onto Route 37 and drive along in stunned silence
It didn't feel like there was anything in that bag
We gotta go back
can't believe they put their baby in a duffle bag
can't believe you left it out there
If you'd let me search it  would never have taken it- We gotta go back

Close enough

Thanks Man, Have a Merry One
turns to go back inside
He sees   through the cracks in the siding and goes to the back
from under the trailer where old insulation is smoldering
runs to the shed, takes a fire extinguisher and sprays under the trailer
Steam rises
The fire appears to be out
83
'    -                                 83 comes back in
Smoke filters up though the cracks in the linoleum floor

Look, there
Tracks
(squints) Where
Up there
Ray speeds up
Faint tire tracks appear in the distance
(') Slow down,  don't want to run over it
Stop

Ray stops the car
Lila gets out
Ray puts her jacket over her head and follows
Ray's cell phone plays "Old MacDonald" on the seat of the Acclaim

dials the phone
He gets Ray's cell phone
' (faintly heard though the phone) Hi, it's me
can't take the call right now, but if it's you, Troy, please at least tell me you're alive, because the boys are worried about you
He doesn't leave a message
Ricky snores on the couch covered in a pile of blankets
65
87
-                                    87 Lila runs ahead
Ray struggles to keep Lila in sight
Ray comes up behind Lila, rifling through She suddenly jumps back at the sight of the tiny face of an infant, wrapped in blankets, eyes closed, lips blue
It's dead
Ray looks at the baby
Instinctively, she swoops down and gathers it up
Ray heads for the car
Come on
Lila follows her
88
-                         88 Ray gets in the car and sets the bundle down on the seat, unwraps it from layers of swaddling and begins taking off it's clothes
It is a boy
She tries to resuscitate him, but there is no response
It's dead
Ray keeps giving it air
There is no response but she keeps at it
Then, between breaths: Tap the bottom of his feet
Why
That's what they did to get Ricky breathing when he was born
Ray puts the baby on Lila's lap
She pulls away
don't want to touch it
Well,  can't hold it and drive
66
Ray cranks the heater and aims the vents at the baby
Lila stares down at the baby in her lap, not touching it
don't think it matters
At least put him next to your body
That will warm him up
But it's too late
Just do it
We can't give it back to her cold
89
'  -                                   89 closes the windows and puts a package of microwave popcorn in the microwave and turns it on
He watches it begin to smoke, then pops open the microwave and takes the smoking bag from room to room to hide the smell of burnt insulation with burnt popcorn
90
37,    -                  90 Ray pulls out onto Route 37 and passes the reservation line: "You are now leaving the land of the Mohawk" Trooper Napoli watches the Acclaim pass again
This time he pulls out behind it
91
37 -                             91 Ray notices the cruiser following her
Shit
Lila looks back
Calm down
Lila quickly pulls the baby near and wraps him inside her coat hiding him from sight
The
67
Oh shit
What do  do
Calm down
Just pull over
What if he saw us go by before
To Bob's
He's got no reason to stop us, unless you give him one, so keep your mouth shut
What if he searches the car
What do we say about- He won't, just remember you're white
Ray pushes the blankets onto the floor and kicks them under the seat
92
37 -                             92 Ray pulls into the breakdown lane and the trooper pulls in behind her
93

He puts on his hat and walks toward the car
Ray rolls down her window
License and registration
Ray hands them over
He examines them, then leans down to the window
(') Could you step out of the vehicle, ma'am
(fakely nice) wasn't speeding, was
Just step out of the car
68
Did  do something
(suspicious) Ma'am 'm just directing you to step out of the vehicle
Okay
She gets out of the car reluctantly
He looks in at Lila, she keeps her head down
Step around to the back of the vehicle
He follows Ray to the back of the Acclaim
94
37,   -             94 He points at the trunk
Ray stares at it, afraid to speak
See that
Ray stares at the back of the car, afraid to speak
(') Your left rear parking light is not illuminated
Ray notices the light
Oh,  didn't know
He takes out his pad and pen
(') 'm gonna give you a provisional citation
Get this repaired in the next 48 hours and you'll have no problem
(') Thanks
(he looks into the car) Who's your friend
69
She looks after my kids when  have to work late
Ray gets back in the car
He shuts the door behind her and gives Lila a friendly nod
Have an enjoyable Holiday
Yeah, you, too
She rolls up her window
95
37,   -             95 In her rear view, Ray watches him get in his vehicle, u- turn and drive out of sight in the opposite direction
(nervous) What did he want
Just a blown out tail light
That's it
Yeah
96
'  -                                   96 looks at the clock

Ray gathers up the blankets
Lila sits motionless
We gotta take it in
Lila sits absolutely still
70
(') What is it
It's moving
What
Are you sure
Lila slowly takes the baby from inside her jacket
His eyes open
He blinks
Ray and Lila stare at him
Hello little baby
The baby looks back at them
He was just cold
Ray and Lila wrap him up in the blankets and get out with Lila carrying the bundle and walk into the motel office
98
'  -                                      98 Ray and Lila look around the shabby motel office circa 1950s with a few threadbare chairs
No one is at the front desk
Ray ventures behind the desk and knocks on a small door
She carefully opens it to a small office with a desk, cluttered with papers and, beyond it, another door
Ray knocks and opens it to: living room hung with heavy red Pakistani fabrics and lights
The dealer and the Pakistani man study a map of New York State spread out on the table
Behind them the Pakistani woman sits on the couch
Ray comes in, followed by Lila carrying the baby
We found him
The Pakistani woman looks up, sees the bundle and hurries across the room to Lila
Lila holds out the baby with a little smile and the Pakistani woman snatches it out of her arms
The Pakistani women pulls back the blanket and sees the baby -- alive
She sinks to her knees letting out a wail
71
Lila's eyes fill with tears
Ray chokes back her own
(') (to Lila) Come on
Let's go
Lila follows Ray out, looking over her shoulder at the baby
99
37 -                            99 Lila and Ray drive away
He was dead
He was just cold
He was dead
Okay, whatever, you brought him back to life
That was the Great Spirit, not me
All  know is Kmart is closed and  got nothing for under the tree
Lila looks at Ray
(') What
Lila says nothing
(') Look,  don't have time for that
can't get deep about every little thing
just have to keep on going
only need one more run to have enough for my double

Here
Lila takes the money and starts to get out
(') Merry Christmas or whatever
Yeah
Lila gets out and goes inside

The trailer is covered in Christmas lights
102
' ,  -                      102 Ray comes in
The box containing the Hot Wheels Tech Track Air Stunt Challenge set is under the tree
What's that
Hot Wheels
She is suspicious
Where'd you get it
called a friend
Mitch
Is that the friend you called
It's probably stolen, you know
No, its not
Well,  don't want you hanging around him
That kid is bad news
It's not like you were gonna get it
73
Look , Mister,  got more important things to worry about than toys
'm trying to get our doublewide
Oh, yeah

Hey, you can lose the attitude
Anyway, Kmart was closed by the time  got off work
He gives her a sideways glance

Popcorn

Sorry

Bernie
She opens the door, but no one is there
At her feet she sees a Pringles can
In it: the cash she left at her mother-in-law's house for her son
She looks towards the woods but there is no sign of anyone
She shuts the door
Inside she digs through an old box of junk and pulls out a 2 foot long oval shaped wooden board, an infant board, and a blanket
She wraps her pillow in the blanket around the board in the Mohawk tradition and picks it up
She tries it on her back, then leans it against the wall, then hangs it on a hook on the wall

' ,  -                          104 Christmas Morning
Ray stands at the stove in her bathrobe making pancakes
helps Ricky set up his new Hot Wheels Set
Knock at the door
Another knock
Daddy
Ricky runs to the door and opens it, then backs away
Trooper Napoli is there
Is there a Ray Eddy here
Ray comes to the door
Yes
Can  speak to you outside for a minute
haven't gotten the light fixed- It's not about that
just have a few questions
Sure
105
'   -                              105 Ray slips on her boots, grabs her jacket around her and steps outside the trailer door
This is about the woman who was with you
Yes
How long have you known her
75
Not too long
She looks after my kids
She's a smuggler
Really
Yes
Wow
That's a shock
Yes, well, there is that element on the Reservation 'm sure you know
Yeah, 've heard about it but  didn't know she was involved
How did you happen to meet her
Uh,  think there was a sign for a baby sitter at the Wolf Mart
That's where get my gas
just thought you should be aware of that
She's known to have smuggled illegal immigrants into the country
Oh my God
He nods his head
If  were you 'd find a new baby sitter
You don't want her around young kids
Absolutely
He eyes the side of the trailer where smoke stained siding is visible
Well, you have an enjoyable Holiday
76
Thanks
You, too
Ray stands and watches the trooper drive away
She feels in the pocket of her bathrobe for her cigarettes and fumbles to light one, sucking on it, unaware of the cold
When she turns around she looks at the trailer and notices the smoke-stained siding on one end of it
106
'  -                                   106 listens at the door
Ricky looks up
Why is the police man here
Shh
From outside the door: (
) could you come out here for a minute
goes outside
107
-                                    107 Ray stands staring at
at the trailer's burnt end
What did he want
Did something happen to Dad
No
Then what did he want
She points to the blackened siding on the trailer
Did you have a fire last night
The pipes froze so  fixed `um
You fixed um
77
Yeah
Did you happen to use the blow torch
She walks around back and looks underneath the trailer: a mass of charred and melted insulation
(') Look at this
We can't live here anymore
It's just a tin crapper
No, it was our house
So, we're gettin' a new one, right
Jesus, you could have killed yourself and your brother
She grabs the blowtorch and slams it to the ground, but it is indestructible
It's not yours, he gave it to me
She goes to the car, takes out her gun then puts the blow torch on the ground and aims at it -- but
grabs it
Put it down
No
Put it down
Are you gonna shoot me now, too
Put that thing down
He ignites the blow torch to spite her
Maybe he didn't like gettin' shot in his own house
Maybe that's why he left
78
That was an accident
Some accident you shot him in the foot
He spent the food money on scratch cards, So, he'd done it before
He aims it at her
She walks towards him
He increases the flame
Gimme that thing
She tries to grab it out of his hand, but he is too strong
(') come on now
You can't have it
It's mine
His eyes fill with tears, but his face stays tight
She grabs at it again, but he jerks it away
She pauses and stares at him
He was clean for 23 months
They look at one another
(') (chokes back tears) didn't know how else to keep us together
mean
he's a good dad when he's not gamblin'
He cuts off the blow torch
Yeah, awesome dad
Robs us and takes off a week before Christmas
She walks up to him and wipes a tear from the side of his face
He shakes it off

They stand in the cold air for a long moment their breath visible
She touches his hair

Ray sees her and begins to dig in her jeans for a five
The ticket taker looks her up and down, expressionless
Ray hands over the money
The ticket taker just looks at her
The game's over
They're verifying the last winner
That's okay

She is parked a few cars away from the Horizon
Other bingo players come out and get in cars surrounding Ray
Mohawks employees, including Lila come out of the "Employees Entrance"
She starts toward Horizon
She wears new glasses
Catching sight of Ray in the Acclaim, she abruptly turns and starts walking in the opposite direction
Ray pulls out and drives over following her in the Acclaim
quit smuggling
(rolls down the window) set the trailer on fire
Lila keeps walking
Ray drives along beside her
(') He didn't mean to, but the pipes froze and he got that damn torch out -- which told him not to do touch when  wasn't there -- and he tried to thaw them out- got glasses and now  can see up close
There's a hole in my bedroom floor
We gotta move
81
Lila keeps walking
(') just need one more run to get the double
Lila keeps walking
(') Look you can have the Acclaim
Okay

What is it then
Lila keeps walking
(') Are you still mad about that baby
`Cause it wasn't all my fault, ya' know
mean who puts their kid in a duffle bag
Lila keeps walking
Ray follows trying to figure her out
(') You're gonna need a lot of money to take care of a one year old baby
got enough
Yeah, but you gotta get him first
Lila stops dead in her tracks and looks at Ray
(') 'll help you
You can even borrow my gun
Lila looks around to see if anyone is watching and gets in the Acclaim with Ray

You should see the inside
How many bedrooms
Three
And it's got a jacuzzi tub in the master bathroom
Wall to wall carpet
Oh yeah
But the best thing is the insulation
The pipes can never freeze
Ray gets out

She disappears into the Office
Lila looks at the house
114
,     -             114 Ray comes in on Guy Versailles giving a young couple the hard sell
what  think you'll find with the Commodore -- and you'll be the judge -- is that the vinyl wall covering is perfect for small children
There is never a need to repaint or even touch up- wanna schedule a delivery
Versailles looks up, annoyed
He plasters on a smile
83
(to the couple) Give me just a second
He tries to take Ray aside
(') What do you want
She pulls a huge wad of cash from her jacket pocket
(') Is this all of it
It's three thousand but  want it delivered tomorrow
told you all or nothing
She holds out the cash
The couple tries not to watch
Take it as a deposit
All you have to do is show up
If  don't have the rest you keep it
Can't argue with that
You'll have to sign something, though
He takes out a contract and writes in the deposit amount as thirteen hundred seventy two dollars owing
Ray signs the paper

Lila rolls down the window
Heat wave
You got a run for us, Jimmy

few times
Have you
No, Troy didn't like to travel
He liked to work in his shed, mostly

Ray and Lila drive down a commercial strip of shopping centers, fast food joints and strip clubs, with French names
Up there
That's it
Can't miss that

They drive around back and get out
music is heard from inside a door marked "Prive
" 119
-                                119 They walk in
The place is mostly empty
There is a scantily dressed  and   sitting at the bar
Oui
Bruno
She points to Bruno
Lila and Ray approach him
He is on his cell phone speaking in French
He looks them over, then closes up his telephone
(French accent) You looking for a job
No, Jimmy called- Oh yeah, Jimmy
Okay
He calls over the Bartender
She comes over
He points to Ray and Lila
She walks over to them
(softly) Put your hands up
86
Ray and Lila put up their hands
The Bartender pat frisks them for body wires
When she is finished: Okay we go
He picks up his full-length fur coat
(') 'is way
They follow him out the back of the club
The Bartender follows
120
,    -                    120 They wait
'at your car
He points to the Acclaim parked a few feet away
They nod
He walks out to a shed and unlocks the door
Two very young  , sickly and pale, wearing jean jackets look vacantly out
Bruno signals them to get out
(') Open the trunk
We need to get paid, first
Oh, yes
He pulls a wad of cash from inside his coat and hands it to Lila
She counts it out
You only got six hundred here
You get the rest at drop off
It's six hundred apiece
The girls stand shivering by the trunk
87
That's the deal  make with Jimmy, now you want to change
Lila and Ray look at each other
It's twelve hundred
You want to make a problem
Bruno glances at the Bartender watching from the back door of the club
(') (annoyed by Ray) because you're not making a problem for me
And you're making a problem for them
Let me show you something
He approaches the two girls
He grabs one of the girls by the hair, kicks her in the back of the knees forcing her to the ground
Lila looks at Ray
The girl tries to get on her feet, but each time she does he kicks her in the back of the knees again
(to Ray) Let's just go
Held up by her hair, the girl slides around helplessly
Lila winces at the sight
Ray stares at Bruno
Okay
We'll take them
Lila looks at Ray
Bruno drops the girl who scrambles to her feet
Let's go
Just open the trunk
Lila leans into the passenger side of the Acclaim and pops the trunk
Bruno looks at Ray: 88
You must be the brains of the operation
He motions the girls into the trunk and shuts it after them
Lila get in the passenger side and Bruno starts for the back door of the club
Ray pulls her gun out of her jacket and aims it at Bruno
Turn around
Bruno stops and turns around
(') want the rest
He opens his fur coat
(cool) don't have any more
In the shiny coat lining only the handle of a long pistol is visible
(to the Bartender) Go get it
Bruno looks around and nods at the bartender
The bartender panics not knowing what to do and begins speaking in French to Bruno
Ray shoots at the pavement beside Bruno
(to the bartender) Give it to her
The Bartender disappears into the club
Ray waits with the gun on Bruno
(from inside the Acclaim) Let's get out of here
'll give you the rest of the money
No
But thanks
89
You're gonna get us all killed
moment later the Bartender comes back, shaking and holding cash
Put it there
She indicates the trunk
(to the bartender) You aren't so smart as you look
Ray grabs the money and still pointing at Bruno, backs into the car
Bruno reaches for his pistol and aims at them as the Acclaim squeals away
Bruno  shattering the driver's side window, grazing Ray's head
Ray falls back, dazed for a moment
Lila steers
Then Ray takes the wheel as they swerve out onto the main road
He shot me
Ray wipes the blood from her forehead
You should'a just taken the money from me
(blood streams down her face) 'm tired of people stealing from me
Is it all there
We gotta get outta here, first
Just   and make sure it's all there
Ray hands her the wad of money
Lila struggles to put on her glasses and counts out the money
(') Is it there
90
It's all there
Good
Slow down a little
We gotta keep it under the speed limit
Ray smiles and wipes away the blood

Hi, Rosalie
(puts on her glasses) Billy
We have a situation with a couple smugglers
They got chased by the Quebec police and crossed the river but their car went in and now the troopers know they're on the Rez
Who is it
96
Lila Littlewolf and some white woman
What do the troopers want
surrender of the two illegals and the Non-Native smuggler
They need an example here
Do you know where they are
Probably over at Velma's
(to the other Chiefs) What do you think
Turn them in
What about Lila Littlewolf
We got our own court system
We don't charge people with smuggling
Maybe we should
If we did, we'd have to arrest half the people on the Rez
Rosalie and Barbara shoot him an
He shrugs
We can expel her
You can't start throwin' Mohawks off the Rez, Rosalie
There's only, what, six thousand of us as it is
She makes the Mohawk people look bad
97
But she has a Mohawk son
She cost us a Mohawk son
Jake was a big boy
He knew what he was doin' She'll never be anything but a smuggler
We've had smuggling on the Rez since Al Capone
Then we'll take a vote

Jimmy opens the door
Hi, Billy
He comes in and Velma walks in from the kitchen closing the door behind her
Velma, seen any smugglers tonight
Velma says nothing
Come on, Billy, you never bothered with smugglers before
Rosalie is worried people are gonna think the Mohawks let in terrorists
Plus, got the Troopers on my back
They want the illegals and they say there's some white lady with them too
Is that true, Jimmy
98
Jimmy looks away
(') You got white women doing it now

The Chinese girls look on confused
One gets up and grabs her jacket, but Ray motions her back
(') No
You stay here
Ray hurries to the back door, opens it, but Bernie Littlewolf is there
At the sight of him, Ray backs up
He walks in
Hi, Lila
Hi Bernie
You're in a lot of trouble
Lila looks at him, unfazed
(') The council voted to expel you
Expel me
For five years
You can appeal, but you'll never be able to change Rosalie's mind
99
They can't do that
They'll make your life miserable if you try to stay
They've already done that
Believe me, it could get even worse
thought this was all legal on the reservation
Bernie ignores her
(') (to Lila) Look,  gotta get home
She moves for the door, but Bernie blocks her
If she leaves, they'll turn you in Lila
The troopers want somebody
But, she's a Mohawk
The Chiefs want her out, so there's nothing standing between her and the troopers
Listen, my kids got no one but me
If you leave she won't see her son again
Ray and Bernie stare at each other
Let her go
Lila, you're giving up on him and he's only one year old

Ray goes to the door, but turns around
At least you got family to take care of him, ya' know

Breathing hard, she stops
Snow melts on her face

The sound of the river ice pushing against the bank releases a long, deep moan all around her

He might be better off
Jake wouldn't agree with that
It was all for a new crib
wanted the baby to have a pretty new crib, not some handmedown
And he wouldn't let me go alone
(laughs)  was too fat to get behind the steering wheel
He wanted to keep you and little Jake safe
The back door opens

Okay
Lila isn't sure
