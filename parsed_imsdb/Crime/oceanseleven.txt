Mr
Ocean, the purpose of this meeting is to determine whether, if released, you are likely to break the law again
While this was your first conviction, you have been implicated, though never charged, in over a dozen other confidence schemes and frauds
What can you tell us about this
As you say, ma'am,  was never charged

#2 Mr

The   a little on the other side of the gate,   and the view ahead is not pleasant (New Jersey):    Life is hard out there

He turns his attention back to his cards, and the cards of the dealer

Hello, Frank
The new dealer ( ) glances up at Danny, and his eyes go wide, like a priest who's discovered he's dealing communion wafers to the pontiff himself
He quickly hides his astonishment
beg your pardon, sir
You must have me confused with someone else
My name is Ramon
See
He taps the name embroidered on his vest, although he is the most African-looking Ramon you've ever seen
pit boss circles close by and glares at them both
My mistake
(collecting his chips, doubled) Table's cold anyway
You might try the lounge at the Grand, sir
It gets busy around one

He starts down
Everybody eaten

Everybody sober
Close enough
Most of you know each other already
You probably haven't met Linus Caldwell before, he's Bobby's kid outta Chicago
Linus trades nods around the room
Okay
Before we start, nobody's on the line here yet
What 'm about to propose to you happens to be both highly lucrative and highly dangerous
If that doesn't sound like your particular brand of vodka, help yourself to as much food as you like and safe journey
No hard feelings

Revealed beneath is a complex substructure, featuring three tunnels, each leading from a casino to a single freight-sized elevator shaft which descends into an enormous vault
Gentlemen: the Bellagio vault
Located below the Strip, beneath two hundred feet of solid earth
It safeguards every dime that comes through each of the three casinos above it

Everyone takes a breath, awed
Smash-and-grab job, huh
It's a little more complicated than that

Bad news first
This place houses   a security system which rivals   most nuclear missile silos
First:    we have to get within the casino   cages -- (indicating) -- here, here, and here -- -- which anyone knows takes more than a smile
Next: through these doors, each of which requires a different six-digit code changed every twelve hours
Past those lies the elevator, and this is where it gets tricky: the elevator won't move without authorized fingerprint identifications -- -- which we can't fake -- -- and vocal confirmations from both the security center within the Bellagio and the vault below - - -- which we won't get
Furthermore, the elevator shaft is rigged with motion detectors -- -- meaning if we manually override the lift, the shaft's exit will lock down automatically and we'll be trapped
Once we've gotten down the shaft, though, then it's a walk in the park: just three more guards with Uzis and predilections toward not being robbed, and the most elaborate vault door conceived by man

Either the guys are too dumbfounded by that bilingual exchange or too numbed by the task ahead of them to speak
You said something about good news
(smiles, happy someone asked) The Nevada Gaming Commission stipulates: a casino must hold in reserve enough cash to cover every chip at play on its floor
As mentioned, this vault services each of the three casinos above it
That means: during the week, by law, it must hold anywhere from sixty to seventy million dollars in cash and coin
On a weekend, between eighty and ninety million
On a fight night, like the one two weeks from tonight, the night we're going to rob it, at least a hundred and fifty million
Without breaking a sweat

(
) pinch is the equivalent of a cardiac arrest for any broad-band electrical circuitry
Or better yet:  pinch is a bomb
but without the bomb
Every time a nuclear weapon detonates, it unleashes an electromagnetic pulse which shuts down any power source within its vicinity
That tends not to matter in most cases because the nuclear weapon destroys everything you might need power for anyway
Now a pinch creates a similar electromagnetic pulse, but without the headache of mass destruction and death
So instead of Hiroshima, you get the Seventeenth Century

the briefcase tumbles toward the floor

An  from the charter airline sticks his head out of his office door

Half-a-dozen firearms turn and point in his direction
The Employee disappears back inside his office
The Head Goon cautiously approaches the van, reaches for the driver's door, and yanks it open
Inside: There is no driver
Just a video camera mounted at eye-level
The Head Goon cranes back his head, befuddled, when he notices for the first time (and maybe we do, too) an enormous antenna sprouting from the van's rear bumper
The van suddenly lurches
266      -                       266 complete with a tiny video monitor (displaying the van driver's ) and a steering mechanism -- it's a near- replica of the one Virgil Malloy used in the monster truck drag race against his brother
And Virgil's using it now, too, as he sits next to Reuben Tishkoff in one of Reuben's Rolls and watches the Goons scramble back from the flat-tired van
Enough monkey business
Virgil brings the van to a stop, then readies a distinctive red button on his remote
