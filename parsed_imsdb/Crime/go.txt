Somewhere in the night, is blaring, but here it's only a whisper with a beat
Water trickles out of a jagged pipe
Splashing up mud, the riverlet weaves through hamburger wrappers and sunbleached beer cans, spent condoms and an old Spin magazine
The tiny stream ripples past glass and trash and the body of a woman
Face up, breathing
Dead grass caught in her braids
Her name is
She's eighteen and bleeding
Bleeding a lot
She tries to         push herself up, but the dirt around her crumbles
Her legs are         useless
Despite it all, there's a smile of perverse joy         to her face, like she's just remembered the punchline to         a favorite joke
(

The surprises

cigarette lighter flares
We're in the trunk of a car with   (22), a skinny Brit with surfer hair
He looks around, realizes where he is
Panicked, he starts  and

No doubt in your mind
The lighter goes out
It's black again

(practiced) See, Confederated Products is a multi- level direct wholesaling company

Irene and started eight months ago and we're already bringing in fifty thousand a year in revenues
We're the number four distributor in Southern California
By March, we might be number three

We look to Zack, horrified
Now, as law enforcement officers, Irene and  can't recruit distributors from inside the force
