Written by Dan Pyne Current Revisions by Glenn Gers January 6, 2005 :  - An unfinished mechanical device: a scaffold of thin metal pipes, levers, pulleys, wiring, serve-motors
works on it: in his 40s, well-dressed but in disarray, graying stubble, hair and clothes unkempt
Magnifying glasses distort his eyes, making them huge and strange
He sets aside a tool, takes a marble-sized ball-bearing and drops it into a slot at the top of the device
His enlarged eyes follow the metal ball - - as it rolls and flips and spirals through a Rube-Goldberg- style maze, setting off bells, clicking past turnstiles - - then missing a leap and clattering across the work-table
Eyes on the device, Crawford's hand traps the ball
He stays still, analyzing
He selects a tiny screwdriver from a neat array of metal- working and electronics tools
Makes a miniscule adjustment to a single joint
Drops in another ball
It rolls and flips and spirals all the way down
Crawford doesn't react
Just studies the machine
Behind him, on a desk: a framed photograph of a beautiful woman in her mid-30s
His wife
-  - is just reaching orgasm - - with  : mid-30s, good-looking, aging-boyish
They clutch each other, shuddering, lost in passion
And then, breathing heavily, caressing each other - Nunally rolls off her - slowly coming back to earth
Jennifer studies her lover, a quiet play of relief and gratitude and satisfaction on her face - - darkened by a troubled distance, maybe even fear
She is, after all, having an affair
'  - Crawford stares through the grotesque lenses, motionless, expressionless
He takes a deep breath and checks his watch
Then he stands, removing the glasses
We now see his office: large, austere
Decor and equipment related to aircraft engineering
Outside big windows, jets take off from an industrial airstrip
Crawford gets a brand-new bottle of Jack Daniels from a desk drawer, uncaps it and swigs as he opens the door to a private bathroom
He gargles, spits into the sink
He pours out more, then puts the half-empty bottle back on his desk
He collects a home-made device from the workbench: it looks like a  connected by wires to a blank credit card
He puts it in the pocket of his suit jacket, which he sets on the desk
Adjusts the placement of the open bottle, nearby
Crawford goes to a light-box, studying a set of large -rays: dark strips of welding in a grayish fuzz of metal
, his assistant, appears in the doorway
The
guys are here
(Doesn't look up) Yep
She hesitates a second, glancing at the bottle
Crawford ignores her, pulling an x-ray off the light-box and grabbing his jacket - - which knocks over the bottle
It skitters across the desk, liquor spilling
Crawford just walks out past Tina
- The twisted, torn and burned wreckage of a large private jet is being reassembled on the big empty concrete floor
in shirtsleeves and in suits cluster around work-boards covered with photographs and diagrams of a crash site
They look up, falling silent, as Crawford comes in carrying the -ray
few exchange surprised, concerned glances; this is not a man who skips a shave
But when he gets to them, Crawford is laser-like - holding the -ray and pointing to a spot three inches above it: It's here
He hands a startled Investigator the film and strides off toward the giant open doors out to the airfield
His foot knocks a piece of the carefully-laid-out wreckage in passing; it clatters across the concrete, but Crawford doesn't slow or look back
-  - Rob is still in the bed, naked under the sheet - watching Jennifer adjust the straps of her bathing suit
What about dinner tonight
She looks at him, surprised
Smiles, comes to sit beside him
Gently: We go out to dinner - we might never come back
Beat
Rob nods
Okay
(Beat) want to wake up with you
want to
He gropes for words, but it's too big and he relents - scales back, sighing: at least see where you live
She regards him tenderly, feeling the same reckless yearning
But also fear
She rubs his hair
live
here
She leans over to kiss him delicately on the lips
- black Porsche speeds down a quiet street near the beach, pulls into a parking space
Crawford gets out, goes to a pay phone
He puts his cell phone on top of it, drops in some change and dials
( ) Lieutenant Nunally, please
He listens to hold music and checks the time
( ) He doesn't come on til six
You want his voice mail
No
Thank you
(beat) 'll see him later
He hangs up, grabs his cell, and takes off down the sidewalk
- Crawford enters
He knows where he's going - past the front desk and outside to the - - Jennifer swims laps with strong, even strokes
Rob is enjoying the sun in a lounge chair
Crawford eyes them as he passes on the other side of a low fence
Unnoticed, he heads upstairs
- Crawford stops at a room with a    sign on the knob
He takes out his -device and slides its card into the key-card slot of the lock
The lock clicks to green
- Crawford enters, quietly closing the door behind him
He just stands there, taking it all in
The unmade bed, the ripped-open condom packet, the clothes on the floor
He is silent
Very still
'  - Jennifer drives her Mercedes convertible past expensive houses in the late-afternoon light
She goes up the driveway of the Crawfords' stark mordern home
Across the street,
is playing catch with his He waves to Jennifer
She waves back, friendly but distracted, on her way to the front door
-   - Cold
Elegant
Metal planters with bamboo trees
Glass doors out to a back garden
fire in the fireplace
In a corner is another of Crawford's Rube Goldbergs - this one the size of a refrigerator
On a coffee table in the center of the room, a big wooden bowl of ball-bearings
Jennifer hurries in, dropping her keys on a table and - - freezes, startled
Crawford waits in the center of the room; despite the outer "disarray", he is calm and focused
You're - home early
just felt a sudden urge
Are you
okay
Crawford shrugs, smiling strangely
He looks pained
could use a hug
Jennifer submits guiltily
Crawford embraces her, tight
She waits it out, until: Have you been drinking
He lets go and she steps back
Studying him
Scared
've been watching you sleep
At night
(Gently) That's creepy
Sometimes when 'm at work, 'll start thinking about you and 'll just get - just - overwhelmed
Tommy - It's a dense, crushing - geophysical force
Like 'm pinned
At the core - where things change
(beat) You ever get that way about me, Jen
What are you talking about
'm trying to describe my feelings
Those don't sound like feelings
No
(Beat) What's the sound of one feeling
in a forest
You think you're so much smarter than  am
That must make you feel very powerful
Helpless, actually
Silence
Okay
Maybe it's time to really talk
No
No
He shakes his head
Frayed and worn, she sighs
Fine
Whatever
'll make you some dinner
He watches her turn and head for the kitchen
To her back: know
Everything
She stops, exhales
Looking down
Afraid
Grateful it's happening at last
'm so sorry
Don't be
Knowledge is pain
'm used to that
Jennifer winces, feeling some sympathy
Preparing herself to turn and end it, to grow, to move on
It's not like  don't let little pleasures, in return for the pain
She frowns and turns - and her eyes go big with fear
Crawford is holding a semi-automatic pistol, aimed at her face
Very still
The gunshot explodes out of the muzzle - bright, harsh, loud
-   - Gifford and his Grandson turn to look at the Crawford house
-   - Crawford stands, tilting his head to watch the slow hypnotic curl of smoke leaking from the gun in his extended hand
The hand, we might notice now, wears a surgical glove
He lowers the gun, bends to pick up the ejected shell-casing from the floor
He wipes it and tosses it aside, on his way to Jennifer
He stands looking down at her: face-up on the floor, head in a small pool of blood, eyes and mouth open
The doorbell rings
- Gifford leans on the frosted-glass panel next to the door - hands cupped around his eyes, trying to see in
Tom
Jen
Everything okay in there
- Crawford steps in from the living room
Everybody just
He calmly aims up at the frosted-glass transom and fires three times - watching Gifford fling himself away
Crawford collects the shell casings, wipes them, drops them back on the floor
Peeling off the rubber gloves, he crosses to the fireplace and throws them into the flames
They curl and blacken
Crawford watches, expressionless - then looks around, satisfied
Waiting
'  - Helicopters overhead,  teams setting up
Nearby houses have been emptied, gawking  and media vans moved back to a block away
pull aside the barriers as a plain-wrap sedan rolls through
It pulls up by the  Command Truck
gets out, surveying the scene
The guy who spent his afternoon with Jennifer Crawford in the hotel is an Detective
You the Negotiator
Yeah
What do we know
- Crawford waits, with the gun
The phone rings
He picks up: Yes
: '  - Nunally is standing by the open trunk of his sedan, wearing a Kevlar vest now - putting on his shoulder-holster over it
Into his cell-phone: Mr
Crawford
Who is this
My name is Lieutenant Robert Nunally
'm a hostage negotiator for the Los - Crawford hangs up
Thoughtful
10 Mr
Crawford
Nunally grimaces, shuts his phone, shaking his head
But then he turns - with the  Commander and everyone else - - as Crawford's front door unlocks and opens a few inches
Nunally considers this, looks at the
Okay then
Here we go
He pulls his suit jacket back on, then reaches into the trunk for his back-up gun
He tucks it into the back of his belt, concealed under the jacket
He takes a walkie-talkie and starts for the house
The spectators fall silent
Radios crackle and hiss as he heads up the driveway
- Crawford watches Nunally's silhouette appear on the frosted glass, from across the living room
(
) Mr
Crawford
The door pushes open very slowly
Nunally stays in the doorway
Hey
Crawford studies him, staying back
Get rid of the vampires
Nunally is confused; Crawford gestures at the flood-lit lawn outside
Nunally glances back, sees the  teams and - down the street - the distant barricades, the media
He nods, steps in and lets the door shut
Careful silence
Do  call you Rob
If you want
11 Not vampires
What
Not vampires
Ghouls
Sorry
Nunally nods, humoring him, glancing around
Sees the small pool of blood where Jennifer fell
Plays it cool
Mr
Crawford, what do you say you give me the gun - so  can pay more attention to what you're saying
Crawford sighs
Is that your best shot
(Beat) So to speak
just think - maybe it would - Tell you what:  will if you will
Nunally frowns, wary
Crawford moves to the coffee table in the center of the room, holds his gun out over it
We both put down our guns
At the same time
Crawford gestures to a chair across the room - by the foyer door, near Nunally
We set them down and step away
(Beat) Then you can "pay more attention" to what 'm saying
Nunally studies Crawford
and the gun, hovering above the coffee table
Looking for a trick, a catch
But there isn't one
If Crawford sets down his gun and steps away, he'll be standing in the open center of the room
12 Happy ending, then
Nunally stares Crawford in the eyes - - then slowly takes his gun from his shoulder holster
Eyes on each other from across the room - moving very slowly - the two men cautiously set down their guns - - and step away
Crawford smiles
Nunally smiles, too, reassuring and false
Begins to edge forward - alert to the possibility of a lunge for the gun or having another weapon
But Crawford stays absolutely still
Mr
Crawford, your neighbor mentioned that your wife - It's Tom
'm sorry
You can call me Tom
Tom
Your wife
Is she here
Yes
Crawford gestures to a library alcove, behind him, out of view
Is she all right
Nunally begins to drift slowly to the side, to see
don't think she is
shot her, Rob
Nunally's nodding, edging to look into the alcove - You shot your wife
13 It was like  just suddenly - snapped
We were arguing - and  got the gun
- okay -  hear you - And  shot her in the head
know it was wrong
(Beat) Are you listening to me
But Nunally is not
He's frozen - staring, shocked, at the back wall of the alcove - which he can now see
There's a big framed black-white photograph: a portrait of Jennifer Crawford
Oh Jesus Christ
Nunally fumbles for his walkie-talkie, rushing past Crawford toward the alcove - - kneeling by Jennifer, who lies, face-up in a red puddle - (into walkie-talkie) We need a medic in here
Get the ambulance up
Nunally feels her neck frantically for a pulse - looking in her open, vacant eyes for some sign - Oh no - God no -  can't - get a - Nunally desperately starts
, his hands getting bloody
He stops to check her neck for a pulse now and then - - as Crawford slowly approaches from the living room, standing behind Nunally
Cold
You know,  think  read somewhere that a good place to find a pulse is the femoral artery
It's on the inner surface of the upper thigh
If you put your fingers - you know, right up inside her dress - 14 Nunally turns and lunges up, smashing a fist into Crawford's face
Crawford reels backward with Nunally - - the two of them falling with Nunally on top, beating Crawford furiously, cursing - - as   burst in, grabbing Nunally, dragging him back - knocking into  trying to get to Jennifer - - Nunally kicking, flailing, spitting at Crawford - who's put face-down on the floor, to get cuffed
Nunally pulls free from the  cops, distraught, angry - going to retrieve his gun and shove it in his shoulder- holster, struggling to regain control
Wait a second - she's not dead
Nunally whirls - everyone freezing, breathless, falling silent
The Paramedics kneeling around Jennifer work - - as Crawford lies on the floor, staring at his wife
Like she's a machine that defied astronomical odds and refused to behave according to his calculations
- Jennifer's stretcher is loaded into an ambulance, doors slamming shut and sirens kicking on - - as Crawford, cuffed behind his back, is pushed into the back seat of a police car
His eyes on the ambulance as it pulls away, carrying his wife
- uses a pencil to lift Crawford's gun from the coffee table and carefully put it in an evidence bag
Nunally stands back, watching the  and  work the scene - lost in his thoughts, shaken
You all right
Nunally "wakes" - nods
Absently: 15 Yeah
'm good
To avoid talking more, he heads out to the glaring lights and chaos outside
'  - The alarm clock shifts to 6:00 am and pops on to local news and traffic - - but the narrow futon bed is already empty
works at a laptop on his second-hand desk, lit by a solitary lamp
He is in his late-20s, good-looking
Short hair, office-pale but athletic, wearing mis-matched sweats from Eastern Oklahoma State College
He jots a final note, sets his yellow legal pad aside
As he goes to the closet-sized bathroom, pulling off his sweatshirt and starting the tiny pre-fab shower, we linger on the laptop screen: rental listings for a new apartment
The bare overhead bulb is on, revealing the concrete floor and painted-plywood walls
His clothes hang neatly on a length of pipe suspended by ropes from the exposed rafters
Law school texts fill cinderblock-and-board shelves
The radio chatters
Willy knots a tie in his crisp white collar
Willy methodically packs legal folders from last night's "homework" into his big, battered briefcase
He has to work to stuff all the files in
He pulls on his suit jacket, settles the shoulders, tugs at his cuffs
Uncaps a pen, leans over a one-sentence letter waiting on the desk
Reads it over
As he signs, we glimpse: - hereby give notice that  will be resigning my position at the District Attorney's Office as of Novemb- 16 Willy savors the moment
Then he tucks the letter into an envelope, gets the heavy briefcase - goes to shut off the light and open the door - - which swings about six inches, then clonks into something
Willy grimaces
Peeks out, goes to pound on a wall
Mrs
Demello
(Beat) Your
Silence
He sighs
Shuts the door and presses a button near the light-switch
There's mechanical grinding noise as the far wall slowly rolls up, letting in daylight and revealing an alley beyond the hanging clothes and cinderblock shelves
He presses the garage-door-opener button again, and hurries across the apartment to duck out under the closing door
- Willy straightens and takes a breath, re-settling his suit jacket with an irritable glance at his landlady's car, parked sloppily next to the garage, blocking his door
As he walks away, down the alley, we rise up to reveal the hazy sprawling landscape of
- and the towers of Downtown, rising ahead of Willy like Oz
(
) Come on, Phil:  called you as a courtesy, and you start looking to take advantage
'  - An ancient fluorescent-lit cubby crammed with documents, case files, notes, reference books
Willy on the phone: 'm not knocking it down to a Class
My backlog of open cases does not mitigate the fact that your client tried to kill his brother-in-law with - oh, right, a "golfing accident"
Your client owns one golf club and no golf () 17 (cont'd) balls - and the "accident" took place in the stairway of an illegal after- hours gambling club
Yeah, okay - 'll see you in court
His cell phone rings
As he gets it: Well,  won't see you in court, but someone from this office will
You take it up with them,  gotta go
(switching phones) Willy Slocum
Oh - hey, hi, yes
Assistant District Attorney   (mid-30s) throws the door open without looking: Wooton Sims
Willy holds up a finger, talking into his cell: No,  didn't
Wow
Okay
Norman mouths "
" repeatedly during: No - short notice is
fine
No, can
Black tie
Sure
What time
Okay
Yes
Thank her
He hangs up, exhales slowly
Looks at Norman
Wooton -
Wooton Sims
Please stop saying, "Wooton Sims" over and over
It's starting to sound like nonsense words
You asshole
Okay: go back to "Wooton Sims
" As Willy gets up and goes out, past Norman - How the hell did you get a job at Wooton Sims
can't even get an interview
18 '  - Norman follows Willy out to a central bullpen area where the shared   work:  and
've been here five years
'm your supervisor
graduated , summa
We're just going to pretend he's not talking, okay
No problem
'm serious
'm really jammed-up all day, and need to rent a tuxedo - for tonight
tuxedo
Oh, come on
You are so full of shit
(Jotting notes) There must be a place that does that, right - same day
'm also gonna need a messenger to bring it here
This is my suit size and my shirt size really appreciate this
Mona nods, taking notes as Willy gets out a credit card
Other DDAs are gathering to soak up some vicarious kicks
What's going on
Wooton Sims buys a whole lot of seats to this charity opera thing every year, because Bob Wooton is the chairman of this committee - "Bob" Wooton
(Enjoying, mock-helpless) It's what the man told me to call him
19 You're gonna need to pick out a style, Willy
style
For the tuxedo
Willy hesitates, in over his head
helpfully does the Travolta finger-in-the-air pose
don't know -  just don't want to look like 'm going to the prom
You wanna go Classic
Fix him up
We'll get you something Classic
(Picks up a ringing phone) Willy Slocum's office
Make sure it comes with cuff-links and knee-pads
Oh, that's very nice: it's good to be back in high school
(Hanging up) Willy
Her tone makes him - and everyone else - turn
God wants to see you
(Beat) Our God
Who art on the Eleventh Floor
Willy, startled, looks around
Approving nods, raised eyebrows
He tightens his tie and heads for the elevators
20 There is no justice
There is no justice in the city of Los Angeles
'  - District Attorney  , 50-ish, sits behind a massive oak desk, studying a thick file
Doesn't look up as a shows Willy in
Willy hesitates
Looks around: he's never been here
Flags, wood panelling, leather furniture, windows overlooking the city
Finally Lobruto looks up, takes Willy in
William No-Middle-Initial Slocum
Yes sir
Sit
(As Willy does:) Eighty-four-percent conviction rate
That's remarkable
Thank you
With a case load thirty percent higher than any other first-year
(Beat) Of course - you also swapped more cases than the rest of them put together
Willy considers his options
He always does
offered my losing cases in exchange for two or three of anyone else's possible convictions
They couldn't handle their workloads, and  prefer not to lose
Lobruto knew this; the question was would Willy admit it
You're going to need a middle initial
21 Sir
You're going to Wooton Sims
In two weeks
You'll be able to afford a better suit
But those guys all play squash and have middle names
They go in for the mother's maiden name a lot
Beat
Willy doesn't like the implied personal judgement, but the only way it shows is how calm he stays
My mother didn't have a maiden name
Lobruto nods, unruffled by Willy's hard calm
So you're a bastard; sometimes  can be a son-of-a-bitch
Maybe you belong here
didn't work this hard to stay where belong
You're a street-fighter, Willy
You should be in court
We can move you up to better cases
appreciate the offer
didn't think so
(Closes the file, stands) Well - you got your litigation experience
Your chops
And your juicy private sector job
Anything else the City of Los Angeles can do for you
Willy's amused
He stands, too
As they shake hands: 22 No,  think that's everything - thank you
The offer stands
If you get tired of carrying a spear
Willy nods - but Lobruto notes the tiny flicker in his eyes: not getting it and trying to cover
Lobruto smiles gently
It's an opera joke
Give my regards to Bob
'  - Willy's twisting in his rented tux, trying to adjust a buckle on the side of the vest
The phone rings and he gives up, frustrated - pushing the plastic garment-bag aside to answer - - knocking a full cup of take-out coffee on to his chair
Which is where he left his suit
Willy freezes
Watching the coffee seep into the fabric
Into the phone, distracted: Willy Slocum
: '  - Norman's looking at a case file
've got an Attempted Homicide
Conley caught it last night, but he's hung up in motions with Gardner
Arraignment in Part Seven, at three o'clock
Three o'clock is in fifteen minutes
Thank you
What's the temperature
23 can't do it
You do still actually work here, Willy, right
mean, you're still going to be cashing your paycheck for another two weeks and everything
Just get somebody else for this one
Everybody's booked up
Look: it's not going to trial
There's a weapon with prints, and a confession
Take the arraignment and wait for the plea
(Beat) real confession
Spontaneous and signed
Come on, Willy
Willy sighs
Looking down at his coffee-soaked suit
Okay
Here's the problem
'  - Norman slowly smiles, listening
You know -  really wish  was going to see this
- Willy slips self-consciously through the double-doors, wearing the tuxedo
He gets even more self-conscious when he notices a handful of local
He hurries in - - passing Nunally, in the back row
Nunally is making a good show of keeping it together
but it's only a show
, 50-ish, looks over her half-glasses
24 Mr
Slocum
Nice to see a man who dresses for court
Sorry, your honor
Long story
Willy, hurrying to Prosecution Table, barely glances at the Defense Table - - but Crawford, sitting beside his   in an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs, never takes his eyes off Willy, intrigued
Grapevine has it the punch-line is Wooton Sims
Yes, ma'am
Good for you, double-oh-seven
(Signaling the Bailiff) Let's see what public service is offering you by way of a send-off: The State of California Versus Thomas Crawford
The Defense rises; Crawford hardly pays any attention to the Judge - glancing back and noticing Nunally, whose eyes bore into him, haunted and burning
Crawford stares at him impassively a second, then turns to lean past his
and watch Willy hastily skim the file
Mr
Crawford, you've been charged with section 664 slash 187 of the California Penal Code: Attempted Murder, with additional allegations of Assault With a Deadly Weapon - Penal Code section 245 dash A2, with Great Bodily Injury,
Section 12022
07
(Beat) Do you waive further reading of the complaint and complete statement of rights
25 (sotto)                     do
But, your honor - You do
And do you wish to enter a plea at this time
Not guilty
But  also want to waive my right to counsel, and represent myself
Willy looks up from the file - startled
Do you have a problem with your appointed counsel, Mr
Crawford
No
just want to do it myself believe it's within my rights
Your honor, if  could have a moment with my client - 'm not your client
Try and keep up, would you
The
shuts up, taken aback
The Judge considers Crawford, thoughtful, then turns to Willy
Do the People have an objection or a comment for the record, Mr
Slocum
Willy hesitates, held by Crawford's strange, amused gaze
Shakes it off: 'm sorry, your honor: we've got the weapon and a signed confession really think Mr
Crawford needs a competent attorney to - frankly - negotiate a plea
Crawford reaches up with cuffed hands and adjusts an imaginary bow-tie
Willy self-consciously touches where Crawford indicated on his own collar, straightens his clip- on
26 Crawford nods: you're welcome
Willy turns to the Judge
- can't - this was supposed to be - with a pro se defendant, this is going to drag out for months - and 'm not even going to be here
The People request a continuance to - Excuse me
Your honor
'm willing to waive my right to a preliminary hearing and go directly to a jury trial
(To Willy) Does that help
You don't need to look out for Mr
Slocum, Mr
Crawford
The District Attorney's office can shift another prosecutor to the case - No,  like Mr
Slocum
Beat
Mr
Slocum
He likes you
Terrific
Mr
Crawford seems to understand his rights and responsibilities
All due respect, your honor, 'm worried this may turn into some sort of a - circus - appreciate your concern for the dignity of my courtroom, Mr
Slocum - considering you're making the argument dressed as a game-show host
Unfortunately, the man is a tax-paying citizen, entitled by our Constitution to try and manipulate the legal system, like everybody else
(turning) () 27 (cont'd) As for you, Mr
Crawford,  strongly urge you to retain counsel
Lack of same will not be grounds for appeal
understand
Thank you
Are the People ready to go to trial without a preliminary hearing
Willy hesitates, irritated
Looks through the file again
Checks Crawford - waiting, polite
Sure
Why not
Crawford smiles at him, as the Judge opens her calendar
- Willy, in his tux, comes out of a staircase and stops
Rob Nunally is waiting by Willy's parked car
You're supposed to be good
Willy takes him in - wary, seeing an edge of anger and fear beneath the tough controlled cop manner
Is that what 'm supposed to be
asked around
You're supposed to be top-notch - but to me it looks like you've got one foot out the door, and you're wiping the rest of us off the bottom of the other one
'm sorry to
disappoint you
Nunally is silent - frustrated
The concrete walls and ceilings echo from distant cars
took Crawford's confession
And now you want mine
28 'm here to warn you
Take this seriously, because it's serious
This guy is stone cold - and his wife - is lying in a hospital bed - with brain damage
He struggles to keep himself under control
Are you all right
Are you gonna be on this, or what
Yeah
'm on it
(Gently) You got a confession
You took the gun out of his hand
It's done
'm just - telling you
Is that okay
Or are you too friggin' busy
No
It's okay
Willy waits
Watching the tortured cop wrestle with demons
Forget it
(Beat) It's a lock
We're good
Put him down
Bury him
Willy nods
Nunally turns and walks away, down a ramp
Willy watches him go
Sad
Like he's watching Nunally drown
But he's seen people drown before
and he's not about to put out a hand
Might get pulled in himself
-  - Willy moves uneasily among clusters of laughing, chatting, sparkling -
joins him, strolling alongside
She's his age, but her elegant dress, unlike his tux, was made for her
Are you a shark
29 Sorry
You've been circling the lobby for half-an-hour now, like if you stopped you'd die
If  stopped, 'd be standing around with no one to talk to
At which point, death would be a relief
Why don't you talk to Bob
Willy stops walking, getting a little careful
"Bob" is talking to the Governor
(Beat) Do  know you
She puts a hand out, gently amused
Nikki Gardner
Senior Associate, Wooton Sims
(Shakes) Oh - hey, hi
It was your office that called, with the invitation
On Bob's orders
Listen,  don't
actually know "Bob
" mean, 've only met the man once
Nikki nods, considering this
And him
Interesting
They're each conscious of an unexpected buzz of attraction
The lobby lights flicker, breaking the spell a little
As the  begins to drift toward the auditorium doors: You like opera
30 Truth is,  haven't really had that much expos- Neither do
With a conspiratorial head-tip, Nikki moves toward the plaza doors
Willy follows
- They stroll the emptying plaza, dressed to the nines
Bob assigned you to my team
'll supervise your case-work, steer you through the office arcana, and generally keep an eye on you
Kind of like a mentor
Kind of like a probation officer
Beat
Willy nods, meeting Nikki's gaze as she looks to make sure he's got it
Okay
Wooton Sims expects absolute loyalty and a hundred-and-ten-percent performance
But: you get to work on legendary litigation
National, sometimes global, in scope
It's high- stakes
And cut-throat - even within the team
We burn out associates at an astonishing rate
You're trying to scare me
Yes
You're going to have to try harder
She stops walking
Studying Willy
31 Can  ask you something personal
Sure
Who are you
Willy doesn't answer
Maybe uncertain what she means
Maybe not wanting her to know
Or even not knowing, himself
We have a guy in our criminal division, fresh out of Yale, named Calvin Tyler
One of our very rich clients gets pulled over,
- which is routine bullshit, so Calvin gets it
Against you
Next thing we know, Calvin is fired, and Bob Wooton, who has never even interviewed a junior associate before - let alone hired one - says you're on my team
Willy weighs his options
Decides to level: It was a good bust, so Calvin came to me for a deal
told him if he could arrange an interview for me with Mr
Wooton,  would throw the case laid out his arguments and evidence for him - and  showed him how  would lose
Calvin set up my appointment for the day after our court date
Then he did what  had suggested in court - and  wiped the floor with him
Your client got the maximum
Next day,  met with Mr
Wooton
(Shrugs) Bob
Beat
Wow
You know what's brilliant about that
Yes
32 You didn't actually do anything all that wrong
Well -  wasn't entirely honest with Calvin
His cell-phone rings
He ignores it
You gonna get that
Everyone  need to talk to is here
They are both feeling the electricity in the air between them
They wait the phone out, enjoying the forbidden insanity of it
But then: We need to talk about your transition timetable
All right
Bob believes in trial-by-fire
He wants you up-to-speed two weeks from Tuesday, because we're getting on a plane to Chicago for depositions in a class-action against our biggest client, Armstead Pharmaceutical
No problem
She studies Willy, trying to make sure he understands: That's catch-up on three years' work - and you haven't closed out your old job yet
'm good at trials
Even by fire
Beat
You know, a little bit of fear can be a very healthy thing to have
33 'm looking forward to when  can afford the luxury of having some
Nikki sighs, smiles
Enjoying him, somewhat reluctantly
'll have them put the Armstead materials in your new office
Thanks
Boss
He watches her head off into the night
He remains, alone, in his tuxedo, looking at the elegant glittering arts plaza
Then he checks his cell-phone
Dials
: - , Senior
(Scene Investigation Division) Tech, works as he talks into a speaker-phone
He and Willy have teamed-up often, and an underlying respect lets them mock each other
Marchand
It's Willy Slocum
What's up
Your gun in that Palisades shooting is no good
How can the gun be "no good"
It's a perfectly good weapon Heckler & Koch nine-millimeter
It's just no good as evidence
It's never been fired
It's the gun from the scene
34 Yep
Bought by Mr
Thomas Crawford and registered to his wife, about a month ago
Apparently a gift
And between the shooting and arrest, this guy was locked inside his house
Is that a question
No,  mean, just: what's the point
Playing games with the gun
He's alone in the house with the victim, and he confessed - it's not like the gun's gonna get him off the hook
Do you have a question  can answer
Beat
Willy shakes the puzzle off, irritated: Look, our weapon is in that house somewhere
Get a team out to search it tomorrow morning
Ya think
(Sighs, smiles) Thank you
He shuts the phone
Takes a moment, looking around again at where he is
Absently tugs at his tie and vest, lets the case go
Heads in to the opera
'  - Controlled chaos
week's work has emptied the shelves and cleared the surfaces, but the file-cabinet drawers are all half-open: Willy sorts folders, neatly marking and packing them
White "trans-file" storage boxes are piled all over
(
) Slocum
Willy looks up, at a  with another file box
35 Yeah
Where do you want it
The idea here is we're trying to take boxes out - not bring more in
Is that the idea
Willy sourly gestures to a chair; checks the label as the Messenger sets it down - Whoa - wait a second, this is a screw- up
already have these documents
sent this box: to the Defendant, at County
picked up at County
Slip says bring 'em here
Messenger holds out a clipboard
Willy reluctantly signs
As the Messenger leaves, Willy cuts the tape and takes out a folder
Opens it: Crawford has scrawled  in red marker across the top sheet
Willy turns to the next page
big red  across that, too
Pulls out more documents - flips through:  -  -  -  - red letters wriggling across the typed pages, like flip-book animation
Beat
Disturbed, he picks up the phone, dials
: - are taking the place apart: opening  vents, pulling books off shelves, upending chairs and tables, removing drawers from cabinets
Marchand, supervising, answers his cell-phone: Marchand
36 Where are we on this gun
We can't find it, Willy
'm in trial on Monday
know
don't know what to tell you
'm there now
You said you'd get a team out a week ago - 'm here now
My team has been here twice already
(Beat) Do you really need it
Do  need it
The weapon
He takes a second
Sighs, exasperated - but honest: don't know
Probably not
Defendant's a whack-job
He went pro se, right
Yeah
Just when you think they're not really stupid, they defend themselves
You've got a confession and an airtight bunch of circumstantial
(Apologetic) We've gone over this place top-to- bottom three times now, Willy
Willy takes a breath
Thinks it through
Yeah, okay
Don't worry about it
(Beat) Sorry - got a lot going on
37 Must be rough, figuring out what you're gonna do with all that money
Hey,  had to sit through an opera last week
Oh gee - lemme see if  can express how much sympathy  have: Marchand snaps his phone shut
Willy smiles, hangs up
But then his smile fades, as he glances down again at Crawford's box of papers
Hundreds of pages
Every single one scrawled
Willy considers them
-   - Metal chairs
Bad light
Crawford sits, cuffed, at a table, waiting
Looks up as the door unlocks
lets Willy in, locks the door behind him
Crawford watches Willy take a legal pad, files, pens from his briefcase, set them on the table
How's my wife
don't know
heard somewhere,  think it was on , that you're supposed to talk to people in a coma
Play their favorite music
Supposedly it reaches them
Willy, now ready, lets Crawford study him
You represent Jennifer
The voice of the victim, judicially speaking
But you haven't gone to see her
38 Not yet
Too busy getting up to speed on Armstead Pharmaceutical
Beat
beg your pardon
'm not judging you
think anyone - coming from
what you came from - then paying your way through East-Okie Cowshit College and Tulsa Law by writing papers for Princeton kids on the internet - my God, it must have eaten your liver
Sixty-thousand dollars in debt, eighty-four percent conviction rate: you deserve this
Willy tries to stay in control
What the hell have you been doing
'm permitted the use of a private investigator
Not to investigate me
Why not
You're investigating me
You shot your wife
Allegedly
That's how it works, right
If  can't introduce something in court as evidence - it doesn't exist
Legally
Look -  don't want to play games with you
'm afraid you have to
39 Beat
Willy reconstructs his formal cool
Takes some pages scrawled  from a folder, pushes them across the table
Is this some form of - communication
You sent me a box of papers
It's called Discovery
The State has a legal obliga- There's nothing in it, Willy
You haven't 'discovered' anything
Have you found the gun
Beat
Not yet
No
(Beat) Does it bother you that  call you Willy
(Lies) No
Crawford nods
Pleased
Leans forward
'd like you to consider becoming my lawyer
'll pay you
lot of money
'm - prosecuting you
Yeah, but 'm offering you a chance to get on the right side of this whole mess while you still can
Are you out of your mind
40 think - on advice of counsel - 'll decline to answer that one
Willy studies him
Decides: it's an elaborate act
Begins to put away his papers
don't need the gun to convict you, by the way
She was cheating, you know
Willy looks at him, slightly taken aback
He didn't know; it wasn't in the confession
As he considers whether it makes a difference - he notices Crawford watching, enjoying
Willy shuts his briefcase
It doesn't matter what she did
Tom
What you did is a crime
Perhaps
But - maybe my so-called peers will look at me and see themselves
Betrayed
Frustrated
Humiliated
And you and  both know, Willy, that people have an infinite capacity for believing in their own innocence
Great
Take the stand
Tell your story
'd appreciate it
Not to mention the fact you have no actual evidence connecting me to the crime
Willy smiles, gets up
Except your confession
Crawford watches him go to the door
My grandfather was an egg farmer
Willy stops, annoyed
41 Is this gonna be about how you had a rough childhood
used to candle eggs at his farm
You know what that is
You hold an egg up to a light, and look for imperfections
(beat) The first time  did it, he told me to put the ones that were cracked or flawed in a bucket - for the bakery
(beat) He came back an hour later and there were three hundred eggs in the bakery bucket
He asked me what the hell was doing
(beat) found a flaw in every single one
Thin places in the shell, minuscule cracks
(smiles) Look closely enough and you'll find everything has a weak spot
where it can break
Looking for mine
No, 've found yours
Illuminate me
Crawford considers how to put it
You're a winner, Willy
Silence
Willy pushes the call-button by the door
Huh
Well
Joke's on me then, guess
Yes
It is
'll see you in court, Mr
Crawford
42 The door unlocks
Crawford winks
Willy hesitates for a second - then leaves
,  -   - It's big
It's got a window
It's got a sofa
Undecorated, except for a pile of materials & boxes marked Willy is filling out forms - tax, citizenship, benefits
He doesn't notice Nikki when she comes to the door
Make sure you sign the one with the devil in blood
It's not binding otherwise
He looks up, smiles
Just want to be ready for Chicago
'm all closed-out, downtown
Last trial starts Monday
Beat
Not pleased: You've got a trial Monday
Yeah: attempted murder
That gives you three days
You told me - and  told Bob - that you would be ready to hit the ground r- The man confessed
And he's pro se
Willy, some but acting as his own lawyer - he could drag it out for months
You want to hear his witness list
Nikki nods
Willy is silent
She frowns
43 No witnesses
Willy leans in, enjoying this part - analyzing, even admiring, Crawford's ploy: It's kind of clever: this guy is trying to provoke the system into declaring him insane
think he thinks we'll call in the doctors and he can fake 'em out by refusing the defense
He's acting out this really - organized plan to appear crazy
Beat
Nikki considers Willy
You're gonna miss being in court, aren't you
He studies her, confident
Gestures to the stacks of Armstead materials: 'm almost halfway through these
And think 've already found about six disqualifiers in Delaware, Ohio, and Florida
have to check case law in each state, but it looks good
'll get the rest done over the long weekend
Nikki sighs, smiles a little, against her will
He's won her over
again
Willy shrugs, grins
In the silence, the impossible electricity returns
After a moment - to defuse it: You don't go home for Thanksgiving
Slight beat
No
She studies him a moment, thoughtful
Careful
If you want - you're welcome at mine
My family's
44 Really
She nods
Smiling a little, knowing her family and starting to know Willy: think it would be interesting
Beat
Yeah
Okay, thank you
Cool
Beat
She leaves
Willy doesn't go back to work right away
- presiding
mid-sized crowd, including a few is in the witness box, Willy stands in the Prosecution Table
We established a perimeter around the house and then waited for  and the Negotiator
It was strictly by the book
So the house was completely surrounded within how long of the first shots
Crawford sits alone at the Defense Table
He wears an expensive suit and no handcuffs, but two  sit behind him
He's barely listening to the testimony - drawing on his legal pad: intricate, dense complex diagrams of "Rube Goldberg" contraptions
Maybe ten minutes
And when you arrived at the sc- Crawford noisily tears a page off his pad
Looks up - sees Willy, and everyone else, turned to him
Sorry
45 Willy sighs, returns to the Cop
When you arrived on the scene, was there a crowd
Oh yeah
Neighbors, came out to look soon as it started
And from what you could ascertain, no one went into or came out of the house until  and the negotiator arrived
Definitely not
Thank you
No further questions
Mr
Crawford
Crawford looks up from his drawing
What
Your witness, Mr
Crawford
Crawford takes in the Uniform Cop
No questions for this witness
Willy watches Crawford return diligently to his doodles
: -:    - It's a mess of loose legal-pad pages torn from Crawford's pad, each covered in madly intricate schematics
He works on yet another, head down, intent
Dr
is on the stand, using a marker on a big diagram of a head: 46 - through the frontal cortex and the temporal lobe, coming to rest against the back of the skull
So this bullet inflicted serious injury
It inflicted serious and irreparable injury
Willy nods, allowing the jury time on this
He checks a note- card, glances at Crawford
Considers his options
Dr
Kang, is it safe to say that someone inflicting this kind of wound intended to kill
Judge Robinson gives Willy a warning look
Mr
Crawford, you might want to object
The witness can't know your state of mind
Crawford doesn't even look up from his drawing
No thank you, your honor
Willy gives Judge Robinson an -told-you-so shrug
Turns to Dr
Kang
would say so, yes
Thank you, Dr
Kang
Crawford tears off the page, starts another
- Nunally on the stand
Focused, professional
Crawford draws, ignoring him
So after you put down your gun, what did Mr
Crawford do
47 He confessed to shooting his wife
He confessed
(Beat) Did Mr
Crawford appear confused or in any way intoxicated, impaired
No
Not at all
He knew what was going on
What did Mr
Crawford say
Nunally looks at Crawford, enjoying the fatal blow: He said, " got the gun and  shot my wife
God help me,  shot her in the head
know it was wrong
" (low, still drawing) Objection
Everyone turns, surprised
'm sorry - Mr
Crawford, did you say something
Crawford sets aside his pen for the first time
Looks up
Yes
want to object
On what grounds
don't know
Your honor - don't know what you'd call it
They - it wasn't the first time, either, but -  don't know the legal term
48 Why don't you just explain it in layman's terms
Fucking the victim
Uproar in the court
Mr
Crawford - You said layman's terms - Your honor - 'm sorry - what would you call it - legally - when the officer who arrested you has been having sexual intercourse with your wife
Utter silence
Willy whirls a look at Nunally
The cop meets his eyes - a deer in headlights
(Low) Oh - shit
think it's objectionable - maybe 'm wrong
Your honor
Detective Nunally
Nunally looks down, silent
Shaking his head
Rob
Your honor, the People request a - Nunally suddenly launches himself over the witness box rail to attack Crawford - as the Deputies leap forward to stop him - all of them flailing and cursing in a tangle - 49 - spectators screaming, fleeing, gawking
Chaos
'  - The Judge grim, Willy panicked, Crawford calm
He had my witness list
He should have filed to suppress
(Shrugs) My mistake
Sorry
Mr
Crawford,  warned you about representing yourself
What about the fact that it's true
mean, isn't that the point here: to get to the truth
Mr
Slocum - is it true
don't know
only heard about it five minutes ago
Put him back on the witness stand if you don't believe me
We can't put him back on now
Not after what the jury just saw
Your honor,  told you this would turn into a circus
First he provokes the witness with an outrageous allegation - My Dick has evidence
The Judge and Willy look at Crawford like he's truly insane
Excuse me
My investigator
call him Dick guess  should call him as a rebuttal () 50 (cont'd) witness
He's got phone records, credit receipts, photographs, videotapes - all documenting the affair
In graphic detail
(Beat
Mildly:) Dick is good
The Judge looks at Willy
This is bad
Thinking fast: Okay - um: 'll stipulate that my witness was less than forthcoming and that can more or less cancel out the fact that the defendant withheld a crucial - Mr
Slocum - your witness was intimate with the victim, and he assaulted the defendant during the arrest
Actually, while obtaining my so-called "confession
" Willy stares at Crawford, shaken
Understanding the trap
No way
Your honor - He's got a point
They were alone in the house
The confession is no good
Oh - come on
Is this a legal argument
"Oh come on"
(Whirls on him) You want to get into it
Crawford raises his eyebrows
Awkward silence
Willy takes a deep breath
Turns to the Judge
Sorry
(Beat) He dictated and signed his confession, after that incident
51 In police custody
Arguably, in fear for his life
'm sorry, Mr
Slocum - it's all 'fruit of the tainted tree
' We have to exclude all versions of the confession and any evidence collected by Lieutenant Nunally or by other police officers on the night he was present
This is insane
It's Biblical, isn't it
The fruit and the tree and - He set this up
Don't you see what he's doing
Yes,  do
And  don't like it
But it's done, so we have to deal with it
Do you think  could go home today, your honor
With Thanksgiving around the corner - Don't push it, Mr
Crawford
(Beat) What we're going to do is give Mr
Slocum a few days to regroup and come up with new evidence
If he doesn't - then you can go home
That's going to put us into the long weekend
We reconvene Monday morning
Willy just stands there: blind-sided, shell-shocked
Crawford smiles at him
'  - The end of a bad, bad day
Willy flips on the lights as he comes in, shaken
package is on the empty desk
Addressed in red marker
The return address: , County Jail
Willy just stands looking at it
52 - Crawford sits on the metal bunk in his prison jumpsuit
Alone
Looking down
'  - As Willy takes a letter-opener from the desk drawer - the phone rings
He answers it, eyes still on the package: Willy Slocum
: - Crowded with
Nikki is on her cell-phone, hand over her other ear: Well - you've gotta admire the cleverness of it
Willy begins cutting open the package as he talks: Do
- Crawford very slowly raises his eyes, until he is looking directly at us
(
) Come on, Willy - give the devil his due
(
) Yeah
'm just trying to figure out what that is
' /  - Okay: then listen -  checked with Bob on how he wants you to handle this
() 53 (cont'd) Has LoBruto tried to take you off the case yet
No
Well, he pretty much has to if he's gonna save any face
So here's the strategy: you let him
Willy cautiously lifts the box's flaps - pulls aside tissue paper - to reveal: single eggshell
Broken, empty
let him
- Crawford begins to smile
(
) Yeah, damage control
Stop getting your face on
As it is,  had to talk Bob down from cancelling your contract
' /  - Willy is staring down at the broken eggshell, barely listening to Nikki
(') But we've got to move fast and get out from under
Otherwise, and  quote: "Stick a fork in this kid's ass and turn him over, he's done
" can't just - walk away
Willy: today, you got killed
The issue now is saving your new life
Willy can't take his eyes off Crawford's "gift
" guess
that would be the smart way of looking at it
54 - Crawford stares right at us
Smiling
Ice cold
' /  - Nikki is sympathetic, misunderstanding Willy's quiet: You want to come out and get drunk
No
Thank you
've got some stuff to take care of
All right
Don't beat yourself up
won't
He hangs up
Considering the empty eggshell
But then he looks up: District Attorney Lobruto is in his office doorway, trying to decide whether to be angry
You don't look into who the victim was sleeping with
Willy burns, ashamed
But unable to admit it
He - threw me off
(Frustrated) Look, Crawford knew he'd be the prime suspect, so he gave us everything - but he made it all radioactive
The night this went down, it was over
But you still walked   it into court, Willy
We might not    have a case
but it didn't have to be   a public humiliation for this   office and the police department
Silence
55 Are you taking me off
You're leaving anyway
'm starting to get a sense of this guy
That's not new evidence
can take him now: he thinks he's smarter than  am
It's not about you, Willy
Yeah, it is
He made it that way
(Shows him the egg) He likes me
What is that - some kind of Oklahoma insult
Let me do this
won't make you look bad
Beat
No
You won't
That's what  need to make sure you understand
remove you now: 'm covered,  took some action
(Beat) If you go on with this, when you lose - blame has to come down
And it'll come down on you
'll have to investigate you for improprieties, incompetence - anything  can
In public
'll hang you out to dry
For the good of this office
Silence
If  lose
56 What
You said "when
" Lobruto grimaces
He shakes his head
Sighs
All right
It's yours
Willy nods
Stubborn
Scared
- Local news on the : Willy pushing past media outside the courthouse; official photo of Nunally; footage from the standoff at Crawford's
The sound is low, and Nunally isn't watching
He's sitting on the edge of the bed
looking down at his gun, in his hands
knock on the door "wakes" him
Beat
He sets the gun aside, goes to peek out the curtains
Lets Willy in
You're not easy to find
had to call Internal Affairs
Yeah - they put me on a desk - 'til this gets
sorted out
He uncomfortably watches Willy glance around at the half- empty liquor bottle, the mismatched suitcases and paper bags full of balled-up clothes
And the gun on the bed
Got home - my wife already took the kids to her folks
Press is all over our front lawn
Friggin' vampires
He falters, haunted by the echo
Willy doesn't notice: What the hell were you thinking
You're on the job and you get called to your girlfriend's house - 57 didn't know it was her house
'd never been there
It was her name
didn't know her name
Willy waits
Nunally explains, reluctant to expose himself: No last names
Her rules
We met at the same hotel room, twice a week - no phone calls, no questions
She didn't want us to know too much about each other
She said it was like
travel in a foreign country
No baggage - from our lives
Just us
Escaping
Did you get the feeling she had rules because she had done it before
With other guys
No
don't know
Maybe
(Thinking, remembering:) No
It was all just this
crazy thing
For both of us
It was
real
You know
We didn't expect that, when we started
We didn't know where it was going
had cheated so many times,  was numb - but she was new
And she made me feel like there was - some chance
To change
We were scared
It was like we were afraid to go forward, but we couldn't go back
(Beat) You always think you have time
To work it out
Or make things right
(Angry) What was  supposed to do
You were supposed to tell me
'm married
have kids
58 You thought nobody knew - so maybe you could just walk away clean
No
didn't think  knew
Even - after
thought it was just - massively fouled-up
bad luck
Like - God - telling me - something
(Anguished) 'm there
My mind is going crazy know the confession won't hold if anyone finds out
(Beat) thought the guy was a whack
Yeah
Well, he's not
Nunally won't look at Willy
He just sits there, numb
Is there anything else you can give me
Anything that might get us some evidence
Nunally shakes his head
Willy grimaces
Goes to the door
tried to warn you
Willy stops
Looks back
You warned me he was smart
You didn't warn me you were stupid
Nunally winces
Takes it
Willy feels a little badly
Two guys in a shabby motel room, in terrible trouble
How do we get the confession back in
We don't
What are you gonna do
Willy shakes his head
Walks out
59 - massive search is under way
Marchand's
Team has been doubled, back-up by a dozen '  - - passing hand-held metal detectors along the furniture - - taking pictures down from the walls - - turning over mattresses - patting-down every item hanging in the closets - - wriggling into crawlspaces - poking into light fixtures recessed into the ceilings - - opening the air-conditioning unit, up on the roof - - ripping out Crawford's high-end home-theater system - - taking apart the Porsche in the garage
Willy paces the edges of the action, restless, edgy
-  - Willy stops in the doorway - watching a  shut the stainless-steel freezer, open a wired-glass cabinet and poke around
Shake the boxes
Huh
The cereal boxes - shake 'em
And there's a chicken in the freezer
Thaw it out, check inside
The Deputy stares like he's nuts
Willy doesn't blink
The Deputy goes to shake the boxes, eyes on Willy: okay
Willy nods
Moves on
-   - Hours have passed
60 Willy steps out of the front door, because he's going stir- crazy inside
Stands watching two  walk the lawn and flower-beds with metal detectors
He notices, past the
vans and Sheriff's Dept
black- and-whites parked in the driveway: Nunally, in his parked car, across the street
He meets Willy's eyes
Worried
Willy can't give him any news
So he pretends he didn't see the question in Nunally's eyes, looks away
Takes a breath, turns and goes back in to work
-   - It's getting dark out
Techs pack equipment cases, carry them out
The place is a disaster area
Marchand watches Willy pace the living room
The garage
Washer-dryer
And the tool shed, and the roof, and the
ducts
What about the door frames
The floors
What did he do: rip open a door frame, hide the gun inside and re-plaster the wall before  showed up
What about the neighbors' property
He could have thrown it over the hedges
We checked
(Beat) He might have passed it off to somebody, Willy
Had an accomplice, waiting, out the back
Willy shakes his head, grim
Pacing
61 This isn't an accomplice sort of guy
He slows
Looking across the room at the big Rube Goldberg device
As he moves toward it: This is a
guy who likes to show off
He examines the intricate workings, eyes travelling the clutter of metal and wires and motors
Checks Marchand - who shakes his head
You sure
'm sure
Willy grimaces
Fuming, relentless: It's a physical object
It can't just vanish
We're missing something - some step in the story
He begins walking through the crime, "the stations of the cross" - re-enacting it, starting from the front door, methodical, reciting it to himself: The neighbor sees her get home
He's already inside
She lets herself in
minute or two later: blood-pattern says she's standing over there - he's somewhere around here
Willy stands where Crawford was
Raises a finger-gun
Boom
As Willy goes to where Jennifer fell: But then he carries her back there
Why
Willy walks along the path defined by the drops of blood: 62 Because he's gonna need time
To confess
When she's alone with the cop
Willy stops in the alcove, looking down at the dried blood, the discarded paramedic-supply-wrappers
Neighbor comes to the door
Willy nods, comes out - crosses to the foyer: Crawford shouts, "Leave us alone" and fires three more rounds: boom-boom- boom
So everybody knows he's dangerous - and she might still be alive
So they'll call the Negotiator
(Beat) Now he's got about ten minutes
And that's it
He stands there with the imaginary gun in his hand
Looking around
Trying to think like Crawford
He can't
'm sorry, Willy
Willy won't respond - because accepting the apology means admitting he's got nothing left
- It's night
The house is empty
Except for Willy, turning on lights as he gets to each room, turning them off as he leaves
(
) Do you dare stay out
Do you dare go in
Studying framed photos: Jennifer - now and then with Crawford - in Italy, Bermuda, Colorado
Always a bit posed and formal when they're together
63 (
) And  you go in - Should you turn left or right
Or right and three-quarters
Or maybe not quite
-  - Checking the contents of the medicine cabinet
(
) You can get so confused that you'll start in to race, Down long wiggled roads at break- necking pace No longer really looking for the gun
He's looking for insight
Contact
way in
-   - Willy wanders through Jennifer's spacious dressing room
(
) And grind on for miles across weirdish wild space, Headed  fear, toward a most useless place
He idly surveys the vanity, cluttered with cosmetics, skin- care products
Lifts her perfume, sniffs
(
) The Waiting Place
For people just waiting
Waiting for a train to go Or a bus to come, or a plane to go Notices a storage box on the floor, left partly-open in the search
He shifts the lid aside
(
) Or the mail to come, or the rain to go Or the phone to ring, or the snow to snow high-school yearbook
An old photo album
teddy bear
snow-globe
well-worn book by Dr
Seuss
64 (
) Or waiting around for a Yes or No Or waiting for their hair to grow
Everyone is just waiting
Willy stares down at the souvenirs of a lost life
-
- The room is dim, and silent except for the hiss-click of the respirator, the monotonous beep of the heart monitor
(
) Waiting for the fish to bite Or waiting for wind to fly a kite Or waiting around for Friday night Or waiting perhaps for their Uncle Jake Jennifer Crawford lies with her head wrapped in gauze, eyes shut, plastic tubing down her throat held in place with tape
Willy sits beside her bed, reading Dr
Seuss: Or a pot to boil, or a Better Break Or a string of pearls, or a pair of pants Or a wig with curls
Or Another Chance
He stops reading a moment
Watching her: (
) What are you doing
Willy turns
work-weary  comes past him to check the
's and monitors
He's about Willy's age
heard it might - help - if somebody talked to her
Who told you that
(Reluctantly) The man who shot her
The  looks up at Willy - who shrugs, uncomfortable
65 Is there any chance
she might come out of this
Are you a member of the family
(Getting out ) Sorry
'm with the District Attorney's office
(Beat) We don't have any other witnesses
This woman had a bullet plow through her brain
know
But you hear about people waking up from comas
After everybody said pull the plug - they wake up
(Beat) You hear stuff like that all the time
You hear about Elvis and Aliens, too
All the time
It's not impossible, though
Is it
mean - why else are you keeping her like this
Beat
The Resident sighs
No
It's not impossible
But even if she did, she might not remember how to talk - let alone anything about how she was shot
When  was here alone before, she moved a little
Are you just going to keep asking the same question in different ways until you hear the answer you want
Beat
66 That's how it works with the law
knew  should have gone to law school
Willy watches the Resident go out
Then he looks back down at Jennifer
Listening to the machines
- Willy wanders
Tina, the assistant, waits in the doorway
He's trying to conceal the fact that he's on a fishing expedition
So this is all exactly how he left it
Yes
Browses a wall of framed photos: Crawford at crash sites, universities, engineering test-labs - awards, certificates, articles from industry publications lauding Crawford as the Go-To-Guy for investigating mechanical failures of aircraft
And he was - distraught
He was drinking
The past few weeks
But he was working on this
He stands over unfinished Rube Goldberg device
Tools laid out on the work table - meticulous, organized
All distraught and everything
It's not evidence
Do you want coffee
He said  should ask
Willy turns, a little rattled
Beat
67 Tell him  said no thank you
- The room where Jennifer and Nunally met
Cleaned-up now, anonymous, empty
Willy stands looking at it
There's nothing to see
He grimaces, nods - heads out, past the   waiting in the doorway
- As Willy comes out of the room - he slows, noticing the little gray plastic surveillance-camera-ball in the ceiling
How long do you keep the tapes
month
Willy considers it
He's got nothing else to try
Can  get a copy of October 9th
'll have it for you Friday
'm kind of under the gun here
We're short-staffed tonight and tomorrow
Beat
Seeing Willy's confusion: Thanksgiving
Willy nods, trying to pretend he hasn't forgotten: Right
Okay
68 -   - faux-Tudor Hancock Park dining room
Wealthy, but lived in
, your basic Henry Fonda/Jimmy Stewart- type patriarch, carves a turkey at the head of a long table, wearing a worn and gravy-splattered apron
Platters circulate in both directions among Nikki's older siblings ( and ), their spouses, their children
Willy sits next to Nikki, who is high-stylish despite the fact that she's dressed "casual
" White or dark, Willy
Anything is fine, your honor
'm off-duty, you can call me Lew
While Gardner piles turkey on a plate and passes it: So - is everyone in this family involved in the law
Well, Nikki's not
Ha ha
(To Willy:) Burton's a counsel for Sierra Club, and Sandra's  - so they use the holidays as an opportunity to give me a hard time, because  can buy and sell them
We're not actually for sale, Nick
Nikki gives Willy a did--tell-you
look
Nicole decided early-on that black sheep was the most effective role in which to distinguish herself from her siblings
69 You know of any other family in America where the corporate lawyer who's going to make partner by thirty- five is the "black sheep"
Well - you may be lost beyond recovery, but maybe we can still convince Willy that defending giant corporations against injured citizens is not the best use of his skills
don't think so, sir
(smiles) It's where the money is
(Scolding mildly) believe that phrase refers to banks
And it was coined by a thief
Beat
Willy remains polite, but won't back down
Times have changed
(To Willy) You don't have to do this
don't mind;  get this kind of thing now and then
(to Gardner) Almost always from people with money
Appearances can be deceiving, Willy
grew up with eight brothers and sisters on a farm up in Fresno, and promise you  saw my share of hard times
Willy considers his options
My mom 'd fairly frequently, so they put me in a Group Home
My younger sister is dead and my older brother is doing twenty-five-to-life
70 Awkward silence
You win
Beat
Willy looks down, begins to eat again
usually do
(Gently) Yes
see that
don't know if you will against the wife-shooter, though
The click of silverware
Whoops
Nice, Burton
Beat
Willy looks up at Burton, steady
Shrugs
It's not over 'til it's over
That looked pretty over
Anyway, Willy's been taken off the case
It might not seem like it now, but that's a blessing in disguise, Willy
Willy nods
Beat
To Nikki, uncomfortable: wasn't
Nikki looks at Willy
What
71 Taken off
That
doesn't make any sense
Lobruto has to do some kind of damage control - asked him not to
Silence
Nikki is staring at him
Angry
You are really stupid, did you know that
Willy doesn't know how to handle this; everyone else tries to be polite, eating and pretending not to notice
'm - getting new evidence - Where
The Evidence Store
Oh, that's right - they open early the day after Thanksgiving
You're gonna be fine
Did it ever occur to you  might be good enough to still win
Who cares
Win what
The man shot his - You wanted corporate, right
You wanted to play in the big leagues
Yeah, 'm just - You go to all that trouble getting yourself in - and then you just pay no attention to wh- 72 Look - 'm sorry - can we not talk about this here
Nikki stops
Refusing to look around
Ashamed at losing control, turns back to her food: Fine
Thank you
Everyone eats in silence a moment - then Nikki tosses down her napkin: need to talk with you
She gets up and walks out of the room
With an awkward glance around, Willy excuses himself and follows her
-  - Look, 'm sorry  didn't tell you - Did you hear me, when  said Bob wanted you gone as soon as this thing broke
Did you hear me say  went out on a limb to convince him - Wouldn't it be better than damage control if  actually turn it around
And what if you don't
Willy has no answer
He doesn't think that way
And she sees that
She sees a young man from Oklahoma, in way over his head
Desperate to get through: You don't get it at all, do you
You pulled a stunt to get yourself this job
Fine: you're a hot-shot
(Beat) Wooton Sims does not need hot-shots
Because you don't win
The firm wins
Bob wins
() 73 (cont'd) (Beat) And you just put yourself head-to-head in conflict with Bob
Silence
Shaken: What am  supposed to do
We told the man you're getting on a plane to Chicago, Tuesday
Painful silence
Yeah
Okay
Nikki watches him dealing with it, sympathetic
The impossible feelings always running under the surface for them have developed a darker, aching tone
If anything, stronger
think maybe 'm gonna go now
All right
(Beat) Call if you want
He nods
Neither one moves
Judge Gardner enters cautiously from the dining room - breaking the spell
Nikki nods goodbye to Willy, and goes out quickly without meeting her father's eye
Awkward pause
've got some work to do
need to call a cab
Gardner nods respectfully, but doesn't move quite yet
Studying the torn-up young man
You know what nobody understands about certain kinds of underpaid public service work
Now and then you get to put a fucking stake in a bad guy's heart
We're not supposed to talk about that when we visit a third-grade class on Career Day, and it doesn't get you very far into the country-club locker room - but it's hard to beat when you actually get to do it
74 Willy looks at the kindly old judge, a little surprised
Gardner shrugs: my two cents
He goes to a side-table, finds the Yellow Pages
- Empty
Dark
Willy lets himself in
He looks for the light-switch - finds only a complex computerized dimmer-panel
He tries it
Accent lights come on, buried in the living room planters
He can't get any other pre-sets to work
The crime scene is creepy, lit like that
The dried blood is black
Shadows stretch up the walls, strange
Willy grimaces, moves through it - sees another panel by the French doors to the garden
Goes over - - and jumps back, startled - Shit
- by Nunally, on the other side of the glass
Catching his breath, Willy stares
He unlocks the French doors and Nunally steps in, uneasy, haggard
The hell are you doing here
Nunally looks around - taking a pint bottle from his overcoat pocket, uncapping it
We need to talk
He drinks, then offers the bottle
Willy hesitates, takes it
As he drinks: We have to find the gun
Willy winces at the liquor and the remark, hands back the bottle
Thank you, Professor Einstein
It would also be good to find a couple of () 75 (cont'd) eyewitnesses
If one could be the Dalai Lama, it would be even better
No - Willy: we need to find the gun
've had three different teams here - He didn't leave between the shooting and when we took him out in cuffs
The gun is here
(beat) So we have to find it
Well - we can't
You want to move on
Nunally tosses something from an inside pocket of the coat - - Willy catches it
Heckler & Koch nine-millimeter in a plastic bag
Willy stares down at it
Then at Nunally, who holds up: a bullet, deformed by impact
There's a guy in the Evidence Room, owes me a favor
Well - it's not so much a favor as  know stuff about him
He can trade this for the bullet from Jennifer, give us a ballistic match
Beat
It's a crime
So who's gonna get away with a crime - this asshole, or us
Willy sighs
Tosses the gun back
Go home
What else have you got
'll find a way
76 Beat
No you won't
Willy watches Nunally stalk out through the big, strangely- lit room
The front door opens, and slams
little worried, Willy takes a deep breath
Gets to work
He still has three days to break this open
Walking through the crime again
Playing it out in his mind
Standing in different places, getting different perspectives
Willy stands in the alcove
Looking around
There's something here
But he can't get it
His eye falls on the Rube Goldberg device
Moves closer, peering into the mechanism
Turns away: no gun
But now he's facing the big wooden bowl of ball-bearings, sitting out in the middle of the room on the coffee table
Hide in plain sight
He walks over - pushes his fingers in, feels around
Nope
He sighs
Takes a ball-bearing, rolls it in his hand
Goes to the device - drops the ball in the slot
The machine is amazing
The ball rolls and leaps and clatters - lights flash, elevators rise and fall, at one point the ball lifts on a jet of compressed air - then it spirals out of sight and reappears somewhere unexpected - - until at the end the ball suddenly catapults out and sails across the living room - - to land neatly back in the bowl on the coffee table
Willy grimaces
This guy is really good
'  -
- mess of courtroom exhibits, copies of evidence, lists, depositions, photos, diagrams, take-out food containers and coffee cups
77 Marchand surveys it
The bleary end of a long day - sifting clues, dead-ends
Willy
There's nothing here
Willy has barely slept all weekend
He shakes his head, reviewing the hotel surveillance tapes on a /, stubborn
Guns don't just walk out of crime scenes
Marchand waves copies of Crawford's evidence - stills printed from home-video Dick took at a hostage negotiation: Nunally doing his job, his methods, his routine
Two months before he shot his wife, this guy had his investigator watching the cop at work
He knew exactly how it would go down - and he didn't leave any loose ends
Then what is this: Willy uses the remote
On the , in black-and-white: Jennifer and Nunally come out of their room and head for the pool - indistinct figures zip jerkily in and out of rooms on fast-forward - - until he slows it: Crawford comes to let himself in
Hotel surveillance
From that day
He was there
Why
Marchand watches over Willy's shoulder
Shrugs
Had to see it for himself
See what
They were out at the pool
The unmade bed
Her panties
Man's gonna shoot his wife in the head, he needs to get himself all worked up
Willy stares at the grainy black-and-white figure emerging from the room, walking away down the corridor
Unconvinced: 78 Yeah
Worked up
Marchand gets his jacket, pulls it on
Willy, go home
Tomorrow you go back into court and take your lumps - then you start your cushy new life, and you forget all about this one
(Hoping to get a smile:) And then you can lend me money and shit
Willy says nothing
Runs the tape back and then slow-motions it forward again
Marchand goes out
Leaving Willy alone, watching Crawford
: '  - Willy stands over crime scene photos and diagrams spread out on his narrow futon
"Walking the scene" again, on paper
The whole apartment is an array of law books, notes, exhibits, marked-up depositions
He's staring at evidence he's already stared at a hundred times
He grinds the palms of his hands into his eye sockets, a dull moan rising into a yell - - as he sweeps everything off his bed in a storm of paper - throwing books - tearing up printouts - pulling out drawers, emptying them, smashing them on the desk - - yelling in a frenzy until his throat is hoarse, his shabby garage apartment is trashed, and he's sitting, exhausted, in his chair
There's a knock on the door
Willy frowns, checking the clock: it's two-thirty a
m
He goes to open it - - revealing Nunally, standing in the darkness, a haunted shadow of the boyish confident cop we met making love to Jennifer Crawford
79 It's done
In the tool shed: taped to the blade, inside the lawn-mower
Before Willy can say anything - Nunally walks away
Willy doesn't move
Watching the tormented cop disappear down the alley
'  -  - Willy - in a clean suit and crisp suit, carrying his briefcase - hurries through, paying no attention to the and
s who watch like he's on his way to his own execution
At his office door, he gestures for Mona to come in with him
Surprised, she gets up - taking with her an envelope with a messenger-receipt taped to the front
'  - Mona watches Willy shut the door behind her
You okay
Yeah
Maybe
(Hesitates) Can  ask you to do something for me this morning
Sure
Write down your cell number
(As she does) Once my trial is in session, wait outside
might call - and just hang up
If  do,  want you to come into court and whisper to me that we got a tip about the murder weapon
You found it
Beat
80 haven't decided yet
Mona studies Willy - then accepts it's don't-ask-don't-tell, hands him her number
Willy nods, grateful
Turning for the door, she remembers the envelope in her hand
Oh: this came for you
He takes it, and as she leaves, checks the return address: Wooton Sims
Willy grimaces, opens it
Inside are an airline ticket to Chicago - first class - and a handwritten note, on Wooton Sims stationery: We only win the favor of the Gods by making a sacrifice See you tomorrow - Nikki He stands in his empty office, considering the ticket and the note
-  - Willy steps off the elevator, into a crowd of outside the courtroom
He's startled for a moment: it's worse than he expected - the dense buzz of talk in the marble corridor and all the eyes tracking him like he's walking into an arena - a freakshow performer - - but he doesn't slow, ignoring the comments and questions, avoiding eye contact - - until he sees Nunally by the courtroom doors, his eyes fixed on Willy
Willy meets Nunally's gaze
moving on, giving back nothing
Nunally watches Willy disappear into the courtroom, stares at the closing doors - uncertain, on edge
Lost, no matter which way this goes
81 - Mr
Gifford, the Crawford's neighbor, is on the stand
Willy questions him, standing by the Prosecution Table
Behind him, the court is standing-room-only
, ,
Nunally, sitting near the front
Lobruto, standing at the back
Crawford writes intently on a legal pad, filling pages with dense scribble
So - between the time you heard the first gunshot and called 911, and the time of Mr
Crawford's arrest - you had the Crawford house in view
Yes
was very concerned about Jennifer
She was a lovely woman
No one but Thomas Crawford came in or out
That's correct
Thank you, Mr
Gifford
No further questions
Mr
Crawford
Crawford glances up at the Judge
Then at Gifford, as if he's just noticed him up there
Beat
Without getting up: Did you see the guy run out the back door
What
"guy"
The other guy
The one who shot my wife
Did you see him run out the back of the house, carrying the gun
Willy closes his eyes
Gifford grimaces
82 couldn't see the back of the house
(Trying to salvage it:) believe
the police went around back when they arrived
No further questions
Willy immediately stands: Re-direct, your honor
But Crawford is standing too - with his handful of pages: 've also written a motion to dismiss
Objection - 'm on re-direct
The Judge hesitates
Both men standing
On what grounds, Mr
Crawford
The prosecutor doesn't have any actual evidence
'm in the middle of presenting - All of his witnesses are going to testify to the same facts: that my wife was shot and that  was, tragically, in the house at the time a witness - and, in a way, a victim myself
'll stipulate to Mr
Slocum's entire witness list right now, a request a directed verdict or dismissal, per California versus Collier, 1982, and the Appellate court decision, v
Watrus, 486
19
Willy stares at Crawford, stunned
As the Judge reluctantly nods to the Bailiff to collect Crawford's pages and opens a law book: 83 Your legal skills seem to have improved over the long weekend, Mr
Crawford
While the Judge checks the citations, Crawford glances at Willy
Amused
Beat
Willy looks down - reaches into his briefcase, moves his cell-phone out from under some papers
To where he can get it easily
Looks back up at Crawford
Smiles slightly
Mr
Slocum
Willy and Crawford turn to the Judge
Have you got any new evidence
Beat
May  have a moment, your honor
The Judge nods
Willy nods down
Trying to focus
He's got nothing, and everyone in the room knows it
He can hear it, he can feel it
There's a restless, hungry edge to the crowded courtroom
He stares into his open briefcase: the cell phone
Next to it: the first class ticket and Nikki's note
Willy glances back at the gallery
Nunally's eyes burn into him
In the back: Lobruto frowns, concerned
Mr
Slocum
Willy turns back to his briefcase
He breathes
Press the button - selects
On the tiny screen, a list of names
Selected: /
84 -  - Mona sits on a bench, a few steps down the corridor from the courtroom doors
Cell phone in her hand
- Willy stands at the Prosecution Table
Hearing his own pulse
Crawford studies Willy, curious
Your honor
Can we signal the prosecutor from here on planet Earth
Willy's fingertip hovers over the cell phone keypad
Press, and a path is chosen
Possibly for life
Next to the cell-phone, the ticket and the note
See you tomorrow
Nunally sits forward
Lobruto is watching intently
Willy doesn't move
Mr
Slocum
Now or never
Willy won't look up
Nunally stares, agonized
Willy grimaces slightly, as if he feels his soul burning up, turning to ash and blowing away - - nods, closing the cell phone, sliding it under Nikki's note
Shuts the briefcase
Looks at the Judge
have no further evidence at this time, your honor
Crawford begins to smile
Lobruto looks down
buzz rises in the gallery - - as Nunally gets up, furious - stalks to the doors, slams out
85 Judge Robinson looks at Willy a moment - then at Crawford, who has been waiting, calm and polite
Very reluctantly: Motion to dismiss is granted
Uproar
The Judge bangs his gavel - Order
The jury is released, with our apologies - - practically shouting over the chaos -  hastily heading for the doors, pulling out cell phones - - and the Defendant is free to go
Crawford gives the Judge a gentlemanly bow of the head
Willy begins to pack his papers into the briefcase
Refusing to look up
The Judge and the Bailiff might be saying other things, but no one is listening -  swarm up the aisles, out to the hallway - and the Court starts to close down
Crawford comes over to Willy, holds out a hand
Willy looks him in the eye
Doesn't move
Crawford shrugs
Even a broken clock gets to be right twice a day
He winks, and heads up the aisle
As Willy watches Crawford go out the doors into a clamor of lenses, hand-held mikes, white-hot halogen glare and flashes - - he hears a buzzing noise
Looks down at his briefcase, moves the papers aside: his cell phone is vibrating
Willy stares at it, as if he'd forgotten the thing could be used for an incoming call
The caller  reads:
He picks up - : 86 - '  - Nikki sits at her beautiful desk with stellar views out the windows behind her
Hey, you
(It's an effort) Hey
What did you think -  wasn't keeping tabs
don't know what  thought
Awkward silence
She tries to get past it: Listen: what do you say  take you out tonight and get you completely trashed
Tomorrow's just a travel da- - there's a gun shot outside the courtroom
Willy turns
Shocked
Screams and shouting in the corridor
Hang on - We move with Willy as he shuts the phone and heads for the doors - faster, pushing out - -  - - into the echoing chaos of the corridor - trying to move in the crowd - - shoving through to where people are yelling and clustered around a figure lying on the floor
Willy pushes closer, until he catches glimpses of: Nunally
Lying on the marble floor
His gun in his lifeless fingers
Blood all over, from his head
Willy stops pushing
Won't let himself look away - the screams and commotion around him retreating into a numb blur
87 Then suddenly Willy looks up - as if he's been called - - to find Crawford, standing very still, in the crowd, on the other side of the body
Everyone else is moving, talking, gawking at the body or averting their eyes - - except Crawford
He's looking straight at Willy
Pleased
Triumphant
Willy stares into Crawford's eyes
- The life support system clicks and hisses and beeps
Jennifer is curled into a fetal position, despite the tubes and wires
Willy sits by her bed
Still in his suit from court, the jacket off, the tie loose
He's been there a while
But now he speaks
Your husband said something
that can't seem to shake loose of
He said 'm a winner
(Beat) And he's right
can't lose can't stand people who lose
(Beat) may have been working so hard to put some distance between me and
people like you - that maybe  messed up don't know if did anything wrong
Or what  should have done
really don't know, any more
what 'm supposed to do
(Beat) But  feel like  let you down
Somehow in the
process
And if did, 'm sorry
That's all
just - hope you
have
just, some
(Beat) Anyway
He feels stupid
Takes a breath
Looking at her pale, drawn, comatose face
He stands, goes to get his jacket, lying folded on a table by the door
Pulls it on, settles the shoulders, tugs at his cuffs
Gets his briefcase
88 He goes to the door, and as he opens it - he looks back
Freezes
Jennifer's eyes are wide open
She's staring at him
Willy stands, breathless, watching her
-  - Sliding glass doors suck open, Willy walks with the Resident from the other night: She was looking at me
Yeah,  understand - No, she was looking at me
- ' beam of light slides across it
- The Resident tucks his flashlight in a pocket, draws a pin from his lapel
Gently sticks Jennifer's cheek
Willy winces, watching
She's reacting
The Resident ignores him
Pricks her forehead - her chin - her big toe
Each time she twitches
He runs his thumb along the sole of Jennifer's bare foot
It arches up
You see
The normal reflex goes downward
Up indicates brain trauma
She's in there
She was looking at me
89 The Resident sighs
Sympathetic, but plain: Sometimes we have to tape their eyes shut
They all move - they make sounds, they twitch
You think they're dreaming
But they're not
It's just what's left of the system, sending broken signals
Can we do other tests
Like an
or something
And  want a coma specialist to see her
You're not authorized to order tes- 'll get you authorization
First thing tomorrow
The Resident studies Willy
Reluctantly: You get the paperwork, 'll do what can
Willy nods, grateful
As the Resident heads out, Willy sits by Jennifer's bed - protective, intent
-  - Crawford comes in through the lobby: rested, well-dressed free man
He slows, surprised - - seeing Willy come off the elevators
Willy hasn't left Jennifer's bedside
He's in the same suit and carrying his briefcase from the courthouse
Mr
Slocum
Just
visiting
This isn't like you at all
No
90 You haven't got anything to gain
Oh - right
That's my weak spot
(Beat) Ever think about what yours might be
Your flaw
Of course  have
(Leans in) The truth about me is, Willy
'm really not very nice
Willy nods
Concealing the ace up his sleeve
You sure do know a lot, though
Got everybody all figured out, everything set up, like one of your contraptions
Then you just sit back and watch it all fall right where you want it to
Must be kind of
boring
At that point
Not an ounce of sympathy, Willy
(Beat) Imagine it - imagine she was yours
And you knew you were losing her
(beat) Imagine days
Weeks
Going through her desk
Her purse
Her closet
Alone
Staring at her clothes
Her shoes
Knowing this is what it will be like
After
(beat) Do you have any idea how hard it was to go on living - with her - every day, knowing
But you had to, right
You needed time to set it all up
your "crime of passion
" There are many kinds of passion, Willy
91 Yeah
There are
(Beat) So - thank you
Crawford frowns
Starting to feel wary
Willy sees it
Enjoys it
For sharing your wisdom
All your little helpful bits of information
(Beat) You were right
About
Talking to her
Beat
Willy winks
He goes past Crawford and out the doors
Crawford doesn't move - except to turn and watch Willy
Uncertain, for the first time since we've met him
-  - Willy - still unshaved, unslept, in yesterday's suit - comes off the elevator, fishing out  as he passes a : Hi, 'm just - - going directly to the key-card slot by the glass double- doors to the rest of the floor
He swipes his card and pulls the handle - - but it stays locked
Willy swipes his card again
No go
Excuse me - 'm new,  just started - and there's something wrong with my card
Can you buzz me in
Who are you here to see
work here
Willy Slocum
'm new - He stops, realizing how he must look
92 Nikki Gardner
Willy Slocum, for Nikki Gardner
As he calls in, Willy sees Nikki through the doors - one of a half-dozen  trailing in the wake of
They all carry expensive business luggage, except Wooton - who is powerful, perfectly groomed, and two decades older
Wait a second - never mind, here she is, thank you
Willy goes toward the glass doors as Wooton comes through - nodding deferentially to the boss, semi-apologetic: Hey
Bob - (To Nikki) Can  talk to you for a second
Wooton glances back at Nikki, eyes saying: don't take long
She nods as Wooton and the team continue to the elevators - staying back by the glass doors to talk with Willy: You let him know what happened last night
told him
Great - who do  work with on it while you're gone
You don't work with anyone
Nikki: the man has power-of-attorney and a health-care proxy, he can disconnect her life-support whenever he wants
If we don't move fast - Nikki explodes - but quietly, not wanting the team to hear: Jesus, Willy, wake up
It's over
What is wrong with you - it's first year law: that woman could fully recover and swear he shot her and it () 93 (cont'd) wouldn't matter
Double jeopardy
You can't take him back into court
told you - we bring a civil suit - You've got no standing
It doesn't have to stick: we just need to get a court order for now - to keep Crawford from pulling the plug
With all the brain-power here, 'm sure somebody can come up with a pretext or call in a favor
Then we can tie this up in court while we arrange a state- appointed conservatorship - so we can protect her while we fight him on - What's the point, Willy
The point
Willy stares
Because she's drawn a line in the sand
One he already crossed, without truly understanding
and now he's standing out there alone - feeling the sand slither away under his feet
This man is going to kill his wife
Yeah
(Beat) What does that have to do with Wooton Sims
Willy just breathes
Vulnerable like we have never seen him before
He looks across the big reception area, at Wooton and the team of associates
Some look away
warned you
No, this is insane
It's what it is
94 Ding
The elevator
Nikki grimaces, frustrated - and sad: warned you
She starts for the elevators, Willy following - You're not really just gonna let this happen, are you
Oh 'm supposed to lose my job over your problems
My problems
Wait a second - this is not about my anything any more - Willy grabs Nikki's arm to stop her, turn her around - and she shoves him away, hard, tears welling in her eyes - - Willy letting her go - as the Receptionist quietly calls for help - - and Nikki hurries into the waiting elevator
The Associate holding the doors lets them go
This is about taking a couple of goddamn weeks off to try and save a woman's life
The doors begin to close
Willy stands facing the cluster of lawyers in expensive suits, their expressions ranging from pity to contempt - - except Nikki, whose eyes are full of shame and guilt and defensive anger
As the doors shut across them
Willy doesn't move
Confused, humiliated, frustrated
He turns when a bunch of   emerge from the offices, ready to act as bouncers
People gawk from behind the glass doors
Beat
Willy holds up his palms
Don't bother
got it
95 He bangs open the paddle-sign on the stairway door, setting off the fire alarms as he stalks out
-   - Willy runs down the stairs furiously - - the clanging alarm, several floors above now, a little fainter
He suddenly stops - clinging to the railing, bent over
He sways, dizzy, gasping - - backs up until he's against the concrete wall
Presses himself against
Listening to his own ragged breathing
Scared out of his mind
- Crawford stands by the bed, glancing over a set of forms on a metal clipboard
, a senior neurologist, and a wait
The machines hiss and click, keeping Jennifer alive
Crawford signs the forms, expressionless
- Willy's walking alongside Judge Robinson, as they leave the building
The Judge is wearing his "civilian clothes
" What do the doctors say
People wake up out of these things
What did the doctors say, Mr
Slocum
They said
there's no way to really know
'm trying to get them to run more tests - but  was there, and 'm telling you
96 'm sorry
have no probable cause to issue a court order against Mr
Crawford - and he's protected agai- ' The Judge stops - giving Willy a hard eye: 'm sympathetic, but yelling at me is not a smart approach
Willy looks at the Judge a second - hapless, frustrated, scared - then nods and shakes his head and turns away - hurrying off through the homeward-bound crowds
The Judge watches him go
Grimaces
-  - Crawford is carefully preparing an elegant, solitary meal
Music plays on his state-of-the-art sound system
He stops, noticing a pair of Jennifer's reading glasses, folded up by a note-pad and pen next to the telephone
He picks them up
Stylish, feminine
He goes to the trash, steps on the pedal to flip open the lid, and drops the glasses in
Goes back to cooking
- Lobruto - at the dinner table with his family - looks up, surprised, as the doorbell rings
He excuses himself - - goes to open the door
Willy's outside: apologetic but urgent, near the end of his rope
'm sorry - but nobody else seems to give a damn that sooner or later this guy is gonna finish what he started
Beat
Have you been home at all today, Willy
97 Willy looks down at himself: he's unshaven, in the same rumpled clothes he wore to court yesterday
Exasperated: No - 've been trying to get some- There's a court order out against you
What
restraining order
(Beat) You were at the hospital
Talking to her doctors
Willy nods
Lobruto looks out at the confused, frantic young man - truly sorry that he can't help Willy fight his way back toward doing some good in this mess
Crawford hired a lawyer this time
They saw Judge Gorman this afternoon
Against me
You need to stay away from him, and his wife, and the hospital
He can have you arrested if you don't
(Beat) 'm sorry
(beat) can't help you
told you how it would go
Willy stares a second, slowly understanding his situation
Can you do anything for her
Beat
don't see how
Willy grimaces
But nods
Turns away
98 - We move with Willy out to the quiet street
The windows of the houses he passes seem warm and safe - and very far away
Behind him, Lobruto watches from his lighted doorway
Willy walks, shaken, determined, into the night
-
- checks Jennifer Crawford's vital signs
She then begins to gently wash Jennifer's face, where it's not taped or bandaged
The monitor beeps, the ventilator hisses
- Crawford knots his necktie, studying himself in the mirror
Expressionless
-  - Judge Gardner pulls his car out to the street - - swerving hastily, as Willy's car skids alongside and forces him to the curb, horn honking
Willy pulls to a stop, blocking Gardner's way, and gets out of the car - holding up both palms: just wait
-  - Dr
Lunt takes a chart from the
Nurses' Station
Has Mrs
Crawford been prepared
'  - Crawford drives, wearing a dark suit, sunglasses
Calm
99 '  - Willy watches '  bring in a document, fresh off the laser-printer
As Gardner signs: Can  use your fax machine
These have to be served in person
-
- Willy brakes as he drives around a corner and sees a wrangling with the
He grimaces, looks around - - backs up, tires squealing, heading for another exit
- Dr
Lunt stands by Jennifer's bed, supervising the Nurse and an Orderly as they prepare her
-  - Crawford walks in, goes toward the elevators
'  -  - He floors it, racing under a light going red - narrowly misses getting broad-sided
- Dr
Lunt looks up from making notes on Jennifer's chart, as Crawford enters the room
- Willy pulls into a   zone and jumps out, papers in hand - tossing the keys to an  smoking a cigarette - Move it if you need to
- running through the automatic doors
100 - Standing beside Dr
Lunt, Crawford watches, expressionless - - as the Nurse and the Orderly work, efficient and silent, disconnecting the oxygen tubes, unplugging the monitor - - Willy dodges people, coming to the elevators - which open
Too crowded
- Willy gasps a little as he hurries up the stairs - -  - - comes out of the fire stairs, hurrying toward
- - - and into Jennifer's room, where he stops
Shocked
The bed is being stripped, the equipment rolled out
Willy stares, breathless, overwhelmed
You just missed her
What
She just went on up
Willy struggles to control his emotions
Looks down
How long ago
did she die
What
(Beat) The roof
(Beat) () 101 (cont'd) Medevac transfer
Out to a long-term care facility up in Santa Barbara
They just left, you can probably still catch 'em
Willy tries to understand her
With growing horror
He's - moving her by helicopter
Nothing but the best
We hear the surge of a jet engine - - as Willy runs out of the room
-  - Sikorsky -76 Medevac chopper is preparing to take off, very loud and windy
Through the open doorway and the thick windows, we can glimpse Crawford sitting beside Jennifer, who is strapped on to a gurney
She's connected to life-support equipment
The   is outside, checking a few last supplies and giving Crawford a moment alone with his wife
Crawford moves
He may be whispering to her
Or adjusting her pillow
Hard to tell
As he climbs out of the chopper - - he sees Willy across the roof, arguing with Dr
Lunt, who is skimming the court documents, shaking his head
Crawford, curious, walks toward the two men
-  - Dr
Lunt hands Crawford the court order
As Crawford reads them, Lunt and Willy shout over the helicopter engine: This orders him not to take her off life support
He's not
We can't stop the man from - Then just hold it - for a couple of hours
Have it inspected
102 You're talking about a phenomenally expensive delay, Mr
Slocum - when the man has every right to move his wife
She's not gonna get there
He looks at Crawford: reading - amused, thoughtful
This man is a mechanical engineer with expertise in air crashes
He has access to airfields and he knows exactly how to make it look like an accident
You know what he did
You know why she's like this
Lunt hesitates, feeling a tiny edge of doubt
Crawford checks his watch
Looks into Willy's eyes - - then gestures for Willy to join him, and turns back to walk across the pad to the helicopter
Climbs in
Willy stares, stunned
Lunt looks at him: case closed
The rotors whirl faster, engine noise rising to a scream
From the open chopper doorway, Crawford looks at Willy again and gestures for him to get on
Willy doesn't know how to react
Slowly, he starts to walk toward the helicopter
- Willy bends, coming to the door - wind-whipped, flinching
Crawford holds out a hand to help him in
Willy doesn't move
The  glances back
Crawford's eyes are locked with Willy's
Willy stares at Crawford, scared
But unable to back down from the crude, plain challenge
Which Crawford is clearly counting on
Angry, at himself, Willy climbs in without taking Crawford's hand
As he nervously figures out how to buckle himself in - 103 - the Med Tech secures the door, the Pilot turns to face front - and they lift off
- Looking directly down at the Sikorsky as it glides over a picturesque mapscape of streets and freeways, gray and terra- cotta rooftops, blue kidneys and rectangles of pool
- Willy watches Crawford, who stares back at him
Calm
Glances uneasily at the Pilot, bug-headed in sun-goggles and headphones
Flying them, calm
The Med Tech, adjusting Jennifer's portable ventilator
Calm
- The Sikorsky glides over cross-hatched parking lots, a pale swath of beach - - and the white foaming edge of the Pacific
- Willy looks up from the view
Scared
Yells to the Pilot
Why are we going out over the ocean
Less traffic
Willy looks at Crawford
- Deep dark vast blue
The Sikorsky flies over
Small
- Willy stares into Crawford's eyes
104 Then he looks around at the vibrating metal box carrying him hundreds of feet above the earth
The sunlight glare in the scratched windows
The blur of the rotors against the empty sky
The edges of the door frame
The rivets in the roof
Crawford's eyes
Amused
Willy unbuckles his seat-belt, lurches toward the Pilot - We have to turn back
Get in your seat
He's doing something - we have to turn back
Who's doing something
Willy points to Crawford, who's just sitting there - He is
You have to get us
Get back in your goddamn seat
Willy, 'm not doing anything
Everyone can see that
'm  you, we have to
He's  - An alarm begins to shriek - on the ventilator
Everyone turns as the Med Tech hastily kneels next to it - What's happening
don't know - 'm - there's a - malfunction - - Willy whips around to look at Crawford, with fury in his glare: oh, you bastard
Crawford almost smiles
105 The Med Tech is flipping switches, checking wires - can't do anything with this, up here
The Pilot turns - steeply, Willy falling over, the Med Tech's supplies spilling - as the Med Tech hastily removes Jennifer's breathing tube and prepares to begin
- She's
The Med Tech looks up - startled
Confused
What is it
Check
Willy watches, wide-eyed, as the Med Tech grabs up his paperwork, searching it - What
The Med Tech looks up at Willy, scared
She's Do Not Resuscitate
Willy turns on Crawford
He shrugs
It's in her living will
The Med Tech looks at Willy, paralyzed
She's
She signed it
There's a restraining order - she's protected - 'm authorizing you to do it
The Med Tech turns to Crawford, uncertain - No extraordinary measures
(Turns to Willy) Unless your court order specifies () 106 (cont'd) contravening her living will
But don't think it would
think you got one that forbids me from disconn- Willy throws himself at Crawford - attacking him, as the Med Tech grabs him, drags him back - - the Med Tech holding Willy down on the floor by Jennifer's stretcher - Willy struggles furiously - Wait
-
Willy is pointing at Jennifer - shocked - - as the Med Tech lets him up and they kneel by her, the Med Tech taking her pulse - Willy, staring down at her, intent: She's breathing
Yes
Yes
Willy whirls around to Crawford
Who's frowning
You messed up
With all your plans and games
Willy turns back to Jennifer
Delicately strokes the side of her face
Her eyes flutter open - Shhhh
It's okay
It's all right
- she stares into Willy's eyes
He takes her hand
Silent awe in her eyes
Yearning
Fear
You're gonna be okay
She squeezes his hand
Very weakly
Crawford is looking daggers: die, bitch
Jennifer's eyes - fixed on Willy - roll back
She fights it
Jennifer
Hang on
Something sad in her wordless gaze
As it starts to fade
107 Jennifer
She's slipping
Her eyes gone empty
Her hand becoming lifeless in his
No
Come on, Jennifer
Fight back
Tears well up in Willy's eyes, but he struggles against them - feeling Crawford's gaze, refusing him the satisfaction
Don't let go
But she's gone
He stares down
Mourning her
Letting his grief slowly burn into rage
He gently reaches up and closes her eyes
Then he looks up at Crawford, who smiles sympathetically
You pushed it, Willy
We didn't have to be here
(Beat) But now you're my witness
You saw: didn't touch anything,  didn't do anything
The machine went down
Anybody asks - you'll have to tell them
What you saw
(Beat) That's really kind of perfect, isn't it
Willy stares into his eyes
Cold
Then he looks away
Out the window, into the sun-glare
: '  - The garage door is open, letting in daylight
We can see the alley especially well, because there are only empty hangers on the clothes-bar, and the cinderblock shelves have been taken apart, stacked on the floor
Willy is packing
He's wearing jeans, an old t-shirt
He carries a heavy pile of legal textbooks out to the trash bins, throws them away
108 As he turns to go back in - he sees Lobruto coming along the alley, wearing a suit
Surprised, waits
You're not answering your phone
Beat
That's kind of an answer in itself, isn't it
Willy heads back in, starts to pack again
Where are you headed
Haven't decided yet
Just someplace else
Lobruto nods
Willy packs
shouldn't have let it get so far out of control
(Beat) We all lose, Willy
Yep
We just have to live with that, and keep fighting the good fight
That's not what  was doing
You belong in a courtroom
Willy packs, thinking about that
Shakes his head
need to - get to know myself better
You're a good lawyer
All this may have even made you a better lawyer
Don't waste it
Willy turns on him - angry, confused, bitter: 109 didn't just lose a case
let a man get away with murder
Lobruto nods
Respecting his pain
Shrugs, accepts the decision, with regret
Willy nods his thanks, and turns back to packing
Lobruto starts to leave
But from the alley door: If it makes you feel any better - technically, you let a man get away with attempted murder
Willy doesn't respond
Keeps packing
Lobruto goes out
After a moment, Willy stops
Looking up
Something turning over in his mind
- Lobruto is walking toward his car when Willy steps out of the garage and calls after him: His wife is dead
Lobruto turns
Uncertain what Willy is getting at
We can still get him
We can take him back to court
(Gently) Willy
Willy comes toward him - excited, insistent: Double jeopardy doesn't apply
We bring a new charge - of homicide
Willy - what happened to you, on the helicopter - we don't even know if we could prove - 110 No: he shot her and she died
The fact that it took time - the fact that he went to trial in between, just for shooting her - doesn't matter
He fired a gun and caused her death, and that's murder
(Beat) If he can twist the law around - then so can we
Lobruto thinks it out
Wary
second indictment on the same incident
man burns down a house; we charge him with arson
There were people sleeping upstairs - and after weeks in the hospital, they die
We'd charge him with murder
Right
Lobruto nods
On the fence, but seeing it now
Impressed with the young man's fervor, and his logic
But he shakes his head
All your evidence is still toxic
The confession, the arrest - it's all still inadmissible
Willy grimaces
Looks down
Thinking, intense
'm sorry, Willy
It was a good idea, but - 'll get something new
How
Willy looks up at him
Calm now
You don't want to know
Willy, you can't - 111 don't work for you
(Beat) Right
Beat
Lobruto sighs, as Willy nods and turns to start back to the garage
With work to do
Don't do anything crazy
What else have we got left
Willy disappears inside
- End of the day
Marchand pulls on his coat, shuts down his computer
He turns to go - - Willy is standing in his doorway
need a favor
- Willy follows an   along an aisle between floor- to-ceiling steel shelves of boxes marked with case numbers
These are from that thing at the courthouse, right
Uh-huh
The Clerk stops, checking a number against a slip of paper in his hand - pulls down a box for Willy
- Crawford is building a new Rube Goldberg device, tools and parts laid out precisely on a table
Eyes enlarged by the glasses, he silently connects two tiny pieces of metal - 112 - when a French door suddenly implodes, a metal lawn chair hurled in from the backyard smashing through it
Crawford stands, taking off the glasses - - as Willy walks in over the broken glass, carrying Nunally's gun
Very dramatic
Willy crosses the room to the alarm panel on the wall
You ain't seen nothin' yet
He presses the  emergency button, then turns to Crawford
want the gun
Why
You've already got one
want the gun you shot your wife with
Now
Crawford doesn't move
Willy raises his gun, points it at Crawford's face
One way or another, 'm going to see to it you receive justice tonight
Crawford studies Willy
You're serious, aren't you
Oh, yes
( smile dawning) Willy
You got religion, didn't you
You care
That's
priceless
He laughs
Willy keeps the gun aimed at him
113 No, it's very sweet
Really
Gonna be a whole lot less funny in about a minute
Crawford nods
Considering the game
Unruffled
Getting it like this: is that going to hold up in court
don't work for the
any more
'm just a guy who broke into your house
When the police arrest me - they'll inventory anything in my possession
If that happens to be crucial evidence in another case, well: some prosecutor just got lucky
Silence
Crawford studies Willy's eyes, over the muzzle of the gun between them
It takes a very special kind of person to look right into someone's eyes and pull the trigger
It takes a unique kind of strength
guess you'd know that
Yes
would
Willy cocks the gun
Crawford shakes his head
Eyes on Willy
don't think so
Willy doesn't lower the gun
But he doesn't pull the trigger, either
You don't know me
No
114 Beat
Crawford smiles slightly
Then 'm in for a - rude awakening
Willy glares over the gun
Crawford shrugs
Tick-tock
Willy's angry
Frustrated
Trapped
His bluff called
Refusing to back down
Where did you even get yourself a gun
(Bitter) It's Nunally's
Crawford is thrown by this - but conceals it well
Nunally's
Really
Willy grimaces, over the gun still aimed at Crawford's face
Yeah
Really
He has backed himself into a corner, and he's getting scared
Because all of a sudden the threat he came to fake Crawford out with - - is starting to seem like his only way out
Even Crawford sees it
In Willy's eyes
The uncertain edge of the idea
He could just do it
End the game
Blow Crawford's brains all over the wall
There  was, with a perfectly good weapon just sitting in the evidence warehouse
It would be so easy
With his life already a shambles
With everything already lost
At least he would have this
Willy
Put it down
115 thought you might appreciate the irony
Willy's finger tightens on the trigger
Willy
Think
And Willy does
Hesitating
Distracted, by a thought
Lowering the gun slightly, looking at it - remembering: -  () Marchand, on the phone - holding the gun Crawford surrendered, in its plastic  bag: (
) " perfectly good
Heckler and Koch nine-millimeter
" -   - () Crawford is getting edgy, watching Willy study Nunally's gun: The police will be here very soon
The exact same type of gun you bought your wife, a month before
He looks up at Crawford
Getting it
-   - () Nunally setting down his pistol on the chair - as Crawford, across the room, sets down his on the table
-   - () If they see you with a gun in your hand - they're not likely to ask a lot of questions
116 That's why you went to the hotel
-  () Surveillance-cam view: Crawford lets himself into the room - (
) That's why you went into the room
-  () Crawford quietly closes the door behind him
Stands, taking it all in - -   - () Willy looks at Crawford
Stunned
You took his gun
-  () Crawford checks the dresser drawers, the night-table - finds Nunally's badge, holster and gun
(
) And you left him yours
Crawford replaces Nunally's gun with his own matching pistol, which was tucked into the back of his belt
-   - () Beat
Crawford shrugs - arrogant: gave it back
Yes you did
- ( -  ) Crawford fires at Jennifer - Crawford shoots at the transom - 117 (
) After you'd used it
Crawford holds out the gun, to Nunally: making the offer - (
) Then you told Nunally you'd put it down - if he put down his
Nunally setting down his pistol on the chair, as Crawford, across the room, sets down his on the table
-   - () Willy turns, looking into the alcove: That's why you moved her back there - -   - () Nunally rushes past Crawford to kneel by Jennifer - shocked, frantic - (
) The truth is  could have done it right in front of the man and he wouldn't have noticed
- ignoring Crawford behind him
-   - () He had
other things on his mind
-   -  () Nunally's calling for help on the walkie-talkie, desperately starting
- - as behind him, Crawford picks up the murder weapon, (Nunally's gun) from the table - - and walks over to the chair where Nunally left Crawford's gun (from his holster)
118 (
) And all you had to do was switch the guns back - in the commotion - Crawford picks up his gun and sets the murder weapon on the chair in its place
(
) - and then wait - He then comes back to put his gun on the table, where it will be mistaken for the murder weapon
Straightens, done
-   -  () Nunally grabs up the murder weapon from the chair, upset, distracted - puts it in his holster - (
) - until Nunally walked the murder weapon right out of the house
Detective drops Jennifer's gun into an evidence bag - - as Nunally walks out
-   - () Willy stares at Crawford
In real wonder
Brilliant
You know, this is really kind of fun
It's like showing some caveman a cigarette lighter
Willy looks down at the gun in his hand
Thoughtful
This caveman's gonna put you in prison for the rest of your life
It's still not evidence, Willy
There's no prints left by now
Nothing ties that gun to me
Willy smiles, slow
Enjoying himself, at last
119 No
That would be true
Except for all those eggs
Those what
Willy nods to himself, going to the wooden bowl of ball- bearings - selecting one, carrying it to the Rube Goldberg machine: With all those little cracks and weak places
Like Nunally
Shooting himself, right there in the courthouse
didn't think he was going to do that
Did you
(Wary) No
Studying the complex device, toying with Crawford: mean, we all knew he was going to fall apart sooner or later
That was part of your plan, right
Like a bank shot, on a pool table: you kill your wife - and destroy her lover
With one bullet
(Turns) Well: four bullets, actually
Right
Crawford frowns
Trying to see what Willy's getting at
First bullet goes into your wife
: Crawford fires at Jennifer - (
) Then three more out the front of the house, to get some attention
- and fires three times at the transom
Then while you're waiting for the show to begin - you have to reload Nunally's gun
120 Crawford pushes new bullets into the clip - (
) mean, you don't want him wondering where the hell four bullets went, considering he never fired his gun that night
- and slides the clip back into the gun, pleased
Willy nods, thinking it out
Sure of himself
He sets the ball-bearing into the slot at the top of the machine - And 'm betting you didn't worry about fingerprints
Crawford reacts
: Crawford's fingers, putting the bullets in the clip
Willy lets the ball go - watching it begin rolling down the ornate tracks
mean, why would you
Nobody's going to be looking at his gun
The ball tumbles and clatters - flipping and clicking through the ingenious, precise, heartless machinery - And sooner or later, life goes on, those four incriminating bullets would get used, and be gone forever
- and Crawford is recognizing, slowly, his one mistake
The gun in Nunally's limp dead fingers, glimpsed on the marble courthouse floor, through the crowd
(
) Except Nunally only fired one of those bullets
Into himself
Willy turns from the machine - - which continues clattering and working, beside him
121 Which means there are still three left with your fingerprints on them - Tom
In this clip
He holds the gun up
Savoring Crawford's growing fear
They can hear a car rolling up the driveway
Red and blue lights sweep the frosted glass by the front door
Everybody has a weak spot, right
Some place they break
Without looking, Willy gently pushes the machine, moving it a fraction of an inch on the floor - - as the ball catapults out - sailing across the living room in a perfect, graceful arc - - that misses the bowl
Outside, the police car doors open and then slam
Crawford, going pale, watches the metal ball roll off the coffee-table and across the floor toward him
Crawford doesn't move
Trying to focus
His mind working
The ball comes to rest against Crawford's shoe
The doorbell rings
Crawford looks up
Meeting Willy's eyes
Smiling slightly, Willy tucks Nunally's gun into his belt and puts his hands in the air
And gives Crawford a wink
Crawford is staring at Willy, frozen - panic and hatred and fear curdling in his eyes - - as behind him, the police begin pounding on the front door
