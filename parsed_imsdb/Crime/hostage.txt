Hostage by Robert Crais based on his novel March 29, 2002 : -- The sky is overlaid with the slow whup-whup-whup of an helicopter flashing through the frame, here and gone
radio transmissions crackle like static electricity around a dirty clapboard bungalow that looks like the puckered asshole of Eagle Rock
man's terrified voice screams invisibly from the house -- ' 'm gonna kill this dog
You make my wife talk to me or 'm gonna shoot this fuckin' dog
five-member  tactical team appears out of nowhere--full black assault gear, M5s, gloved and masked--hustling into position on either side of the front door
Only now do we get the full picture:  Helicopters overhead, radio cars surrounding the house, an army of cops itching the pull the trigger -- When the tac team is good to go, the team leader gives a thumbs-up to -- Talley and Leifitz are hunkered behind the  Command and Control van
Leifitz is the Crisis Response Team commander; Talley, the primary negotiator
It's so hot out here that Talley has stripped down to a tee-shirt and vest
They're good to go, Talley
Your word, and we're in the house
No one's going anywhere, -
We can talk this guy down
Talley lifts a dedicated crisis phone that's been hardlined into the house, his tone reasonable and friendly -- (') (into the phone) Hey, George
George, don't kill the dog, okay
We don't want to hear a gun go off in there
phone crashes through the window and lands in the front yard -- ' (screaming from the house) Fuck you
don't think he wants to talk
Frustrated, Talley slumps back against the van as the Intelligence Officer, Lloyd Keith, scuttles up to them -- Where's the guy's wife
She didn't take the kid to her sister's
The neighbors were wrong
Goddamnit, you said we had her
told him we had her
We got bad information, Talley
can't pull her out of my ass
Up at the house, George Edward Malik steps into the window
Malik is a forty-year-old freaked-out loser who has turned the corner on insanity -- (shouting at Talley) You said my wife was gonna talk to me, you lying fuck
'm gonna kill her dog, then shoot myself
mean it
Talley stares at Malik, thinking, then abruptly grabs Keith by the collar -- (to Keith) Pull the dog's name out of your ass
Get the dog's name
Talley steps out from behind the command van so that Malik can see him
(alarmed by Talley's move) Talley
You're in the line of fire
Talley ignores Leifitz; he is totally focused on Malik and on defusing the situation -- didn't lie to you, George
You scared your wife pretty good last night
We're having a hard time finding her
She better talk to me
'm gonna kill her goddamned dog
You and  have been talking for, what, sixteen hours
Keep talking
Is that your dog, too
Malik steps away from the window -- ' don't know whose dog it is
She lied about everything else, so she probably lied about the dog
know you're hurting
You lose your job, you find out your wife's fucking another guy
but don't give up
We'll have her talk to you
' Then why won't she open her mouth
Why doesn't the bitch say something
Something about Malik's statement bothers Talley
The wording is odd, suspicious -- George
Come back to the window
' Talley grows even more concerned
Was Malik talking to him
George
Leave the dog alone and come to the window
Talley sees Keith rejoin Leifitz -- (') (to Leifitz) What's the dog's name
The neighbors say he doesn't have a dog
The pieces fall into place for Talley:  The wife that no one can find, the dog that doesn't exist
' ' In a single terrible moment, Talley realizes that Malik is not talking to him; he's talking to his wife -- Murray
They're in the house
His wife's in the house
Even as Talley screams, a gunshot echoes from the house, freezing the moment
second shot follows the first as the tactical team breaches the front door -- Talley sprints forward, running as hard as he can in nightmare slow motion -- '  -- Talley shoulders inside on the heels of the tactical team through drifting gun smoke and lancing sunlight
cops are cuffing Malik even though he's already dead of a self- inflicted gunshot wound; Malik's wife is sprawled on the couch where she has been dead for fourteen hours; two tac officers are trying to stop the geyser of arterial blood that sprays from the neck of Malik's nine-year-old son even as one of them screams for the paramedics -- Talley is numb; it's all too much, too heavy, too horrible
He kneels between to the tactical cops and takes the boy's hand
He stares into the boy's eyes, and the boy stares back
The child's face grows pale as he drains of blood
We hear his heart beating
We hear it slow
We hear it stop
Talley stares at the dead boy
The dead boy's lifeless eyes stare at nothing
Another hyperblue sky, but now we're in an upscale bedroom community in the sun-scorched high desert north of  -- legend appears:  One Year Later
'     -- rotted-out Toyota pickup lurches to a stop alongside the minimart, white-boy hip-hop booming on the radio which dies with the engine -- Dennis Rooney is driving; twenty-three years old, working- class desert trash with a high opinion of his own brooding good looks
In the middle: Kevin Rooney, nineteen, scared shitless at what they're about to do
Riding shotgun:  Mars Krupchek, twenty-four, a large pasty guy with a shaved head and faraway eyes
'mon, Dennis, this is stupid
thought we were gonna go to the movies
(grins past Kevin to Mars) Mars
Whattaya think, dude
Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right
'll check it out
Mars slides out of the truck
He has a tattoo on the back of his tattoo that says:
As soon as Mars is gone, Dennis frowns at Kevin -- Try to act cool, okay
He's gonna think you're a dick
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin
We got jobs, man; we're working
Why even take the chance
Because if you don't take the chance, you're already dead
Dennis pulls a pistol from his pants to check the magazine
(') Thirty seconds, we'll be down the road
Thirty seconds
Then we'll go to the movies
Mars returns and nods his approval -- It's perfect
That's all it takes
'  -- Junior Kim, Jr
, is short, squat, and forty-two years old
He's reading a magazine behind the counter when Dennis and Mars enter; Dennis trying to disarm him with a smile -- As Dennis reaches the counter, he lifts his tee-shirt to reveal the butt of his pistol -- pack of Marlboros for my friend and all your cash, you gook motherfucker
But Junior Kim is ready
He lurches to his feet, bringing up a pistol of his own -- He's got a gun
Dennis lunges across the counter, grabbing Kim's gun, and the two men are suddenly locked in a ferocious death-struggle for possession of the weapon -- Mars, help me -- Dennis and Kim bounce from the counter to the Slurpy machine, the Glock locked between them, pointing first one way, then the other, their eyes meeting as --  -- the gun goes off
Junior Kim's eyes widen
Dennis and Junior both look down at the red blossom that grows on Junior Kim's chest -- (screaming in the background) Dennis
Dennis, someone's coming
Kim falls into the Slurpy machine, then slides to the floor
Dennis scrambles over the counter and sprints for the door
But Mars hesitates
Instead of running, he picks up Kim's gun, then leans over the counter to look at Kim's body
We cannot see his face -- -- forty-something soccer mom named Margaret Hammond is about to enter the minimart when Dennis and Kevin burst out, knocking her on her ass
Mars follows a moment later -- Margaret watches their red pickup lurch away, then rushes into the store -- -- Dennis power-shifts into gear, clashing tortured metal as he pushes the Toyota as hard as it will go
No one is talking; they're screaming -- There's fuckin' blood all over you
didn't know he would have a gun
It just went off
Dennis sees himself in the rearview mirror
His face is splattered with red dew, the sight of it freaking him out -- (') Jesus
Fuckin' Jesus, it's on my face
The trunk careens crazily off the road
Mars calmly runs a hand over Dennis's face -- Relax
It's only blood
Dennis upshifts hard again, the truck lurching as the tranny howls -- you, Mars
got it all over me
-- whereupon the tortured transmission gives with a loud and the truck loses power -- (') MotherFUCKING piece of
-- Flanders Road is lined with trees, hedges, and the exclusive housing developments that dot the countryside around Bristo Camino
The Toyota jerks to a stop well off the road, and Dennis, Mars, and Kevin pile out, stuffing pistols and bullets into their pockets -- That woman's gonna call the cops
Shut up, goddamnit
Just calm down
What if he's dead
What if you killed him
Dennis grabs him by the throat; Mars steps between them -- People are looking
Dennis sees that Mars is right; people in passing cars are looking
He releases his brother -- That's why we gotta keep going
'm not gonna go in for murder
We're on foot
We can't get away
We're surrounded by houses, dumbass
Every house has a car in the garage
All we have to do is take one
Dennis and Mars take off for the wall, Kevin reluctantly following -- '  --  -- -- The camera reveals a two-story California Mediterranean home in the exclusive housing development known as York Estates
You can't get in the door for less than one-point-five, and this house costs more:  Eight thousand square feet of used brick and custom tile set on a lushly landscaped acre -- ' You can pick them up whenever you want
'  -- Walter Smith is at his computer behind his desk
He's forty and fit, casually dressed with thinning hair and glasses, currently leaning back as he talks on his phone -- (into the phone) have his corporate and personal on two disks, labeled Marlon and Al
As Smith talks, he ejects a Zip disk from his computer, attaches a label reading Al, then places it in a palm-sized case beside the first disk, Marlon -- (') What, you don't have a sense of humor
He's going to love it
Walter's ten-year-old son, Thomas, suddenly charges around the desk and pulls at his father's arm -- My stomach is eating me
(into the phone) Yeah, that's Thomas, the human piranha
have to feed the animals while Pam's in Florida with her sister
My stomach has teeth
It's eating my guts
(still with the phone) Listen, is Glen on his way
Great
The paper's bagged and ready to go
Bye
(hangs up; then) All right, all right, all right--it's feeding time
Walter allows his son to pull him around the desk to -- '   --   -- boom box blasts the latest teendiva megahit as Walter's sixteen-year-old daughter, Jennifer, stretches out in cutoff shorts and a bikini top, working on her tan
Walter and Thomas appear in the French doors that open from the back of the house -- (calling) Jen
Come feed your brother
He's wasting away
Can't we send him to Florida
Jen, c'mon, chop-chop
've got to finish my work
Jennifer rolls her eyes, rises from the chaise longue, and pads to the house
As she clears the frame, the camera swings toward the overgrown wall at the edge of the property
Dennis silenty drops into the bushes -- -- sky blue Bristo Camino patrol car cruises along Flanders Road -- --    -- Welch is a young officer with an innocence to his eyes that you don't find in urban cops
He keeps a photo of his wife and toddler son taped to the dash
Four, base
You there, Mike
Welch picks up the radio microphone -- Four
'm gonna hit the Krispy-Kreme
You want a dozen
Armed robbery, Kim's Minimart on Flanders Road, shots fired with a man down
This is so unexpected that Welch waits for the punchline -- Are you kidding me
Ah, suspects are three white males driving a red pickup last seen eastbound on Flanders
Welch turns on his lights just as he sees the red Toyota pickup abandoned on the side of the road and stands on his brakes -- '  -- The Smiths' home sports an open floor plan with the kitchen centrally located between a large family room, a hall that leads to the front of the house, and the French doors that open onto the pool area
Jennifer is putting the finishing touches on three tuna sandwiches as she calls to her brother -- Tell Daddy that lunch is ready
(no answer) Thomas, don't be a turd
Tell --
She turns to find herself face-to-face with Dennis, who clamps a hand over her mouth -- (quietly) 'm not going to hurt you
Mars is holding Thomas
Kevin is by the French doors -- (') Stop fighting
Relax, and 'll let go
Jennifer struggles until she sees that Mars is holding a pistol to Thomas's head -- (') That's better
Be cool and we'll be outta here in five minutes
Understand
Jennifer nods, and Dennis removes his hand
He has her pinned to the counter, his body pressed into her's; she is suddenly very aware that she is almost naked -- (') Who else is here
My father
Dennis grabs her hair and pulls her away -- '  -- It happens fast:  Dennis shoves Jennifer into the room, and Mars and Kevin follow with Thomas -- Walter is feeding a computer print-out into a paper shredder as they burst through the door -- Get your ass in the chair
Sit down
Dennis shoves Jennifer to the floor and stalks directly across the room, his gun trained on Walter
Walter freezes, hands motionless, letting the paper feed into the shredder
Strangely, he has little outward reaction -- (quietly) Jen
Are you all right
She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair
Walter carefully sits
He is amazingly calm in the face of this invasion
(') Kevin
Don't stand there, asshole, close the windows
Mars, keep him covered, dude
Mars pushes Thomas down beside Jennifer, then aims his gun at Walter
Kevin closes the shutters as Dennis rips the electric cord from a lamp -- Who sent you
Don't go Rambo and you'll tell'm about this on the back nine
'm gonna tie you up, then we're gonna take your car
Walter glances toward the shredder; the final page of paper emerges as spaghetti and then the shredder stops -- The car
All you want is the car
Am  talkin' raghead
want your car
Gimme the goddamned keys
strange smile flickers at the corner of Walter's mouth as if there's a joke within all this, then -- The keys are on the wall by the garage
Take it
The tank's almost full
Dennis
The cops
Dennis rushes to the window -- '  --    -- Mike Welch climbs out of the patrol car and keys his shoulder mike as he appraises the house -- (into his radio mike) They had to go through the yard at 455 Castle Way
'm going to approach
Welch slowly moves up the walk toward the front door -- -- Dennis shoves Jennifer to the door -- Open it
You remember 'm right here
-- Welch is halfway up the walk when the door opens and Jennifer, clearly terrified, peers out
Welch hesitates -- (into his mike) Teenage female opened the front door
(to Jennifer) Miss,  found an abandoned vehicle on the other side of your wall
Did three young men run through the area
Jennifer doesn't answer
Her eyes fill until two huge tears roll down her cheeks
Welch grows uneasy
Something is wrong, but he doesn't know what
He stays where he is -- (') Miss
didn't
see anyone
Welch stares into Jennifer's eyes, pointedly shifting his gaze to ask the silent question:  Are they here
'  -- are peering out the shutters when -- Mars suddenly shouts -- He's going for his gun
Mars opens fire, shooting through the window as -- kicks the door closed and fires through the door, Jennifer screaming, as -- --  -- tumbles backward, struggling weakly to pull his gun as blood bubbles in his mouth
He tries to rise, but can't -- (into his radio) Officer down
Jesus, 've been shot
Mike
Mike, what did you say
Mike Welch blinks at the sky, but cannot answer -- -- It's the kind of small-town police facility you might expect: general room with desks and computers, a coffee machine, and a desk officer who thinks that crime is two teenagers egging a house
The camera establishes the low-key atmosphere, during which it finds a glass door labeled
Talley, chief of police -- '  -- Jeff Talley is behind the desk, his voice muted because he is locked in a painful phone conversation -- (into phone) It's really hard, Jane
This isn't the way  want it
'  -- Jane Talley is an attractive woman in her mid-thirties
She has the efficient manner of a registered nurse, which she is, and right now she's using all of her professional detachment to keep herself together -- (into phone) No
Then whose idea was it for you take a job in the middle of nowhere
Intercut Talley, who considers the photographs that decorate his wall:  Shots of Talley in happier times with Jane and their teenaged daughter, Amanda; Talley as a young officer; the framed headline from the Bristo Weekly Standard proclaiming:  -
need to work out some stuff
You're hiding, Jeffrey
You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me
still see that boy's eyes
Jane softens; she knows that a part of him is in terrible pain
But she's in pain, too -- That happened a year ago
You've been gone for almost six months
How long do you have to punish yourself for something that wasn't your fault
Talley studies the picture of his wife and daughter
He focuses on Amanda -- Is Amanda there
Jane cups the phone and calls to her daughter
Amanda enters and goes to the refrigerator
She's fifteen and carrying the weight of a seriously bad attitude -- (to Amanda) It's Dad
He wants to speak with you
(doesn't even glance over) 'm gonna see him later
(back to Talley) She has to go to the bathroom
Jane turns away and lowers her voice, not wanting Amanda to hear -- (') You're not only punishing yourself, Jeff
Amanda and  are in this, too
Talley knows, and he hurts like hell because of it -- Can we talk some more when you get here
We'll see you in a couple of hours
Jane hangs up without waiting for a response, then closes her eyes, trying hard to keep herself together
don't wanna go up there
want to stay here with my friends
Pack your things
You're going
Jane stalks away without a glance back, and Amanda angrily flips off her mother -- He is clearly shaken by the call, but his thoughts are interrupted when his assistant, an older woman named Louise Vance, bursts in -- Mike's been shot
Someone shot Junior Kim, too -- Talley comes around his desk -- What are you talking about, shot
What happened
Three white males shot Junior
Mike followed them to York Estates -- Where are they
York Estates
Four-five-five Castle Way
Anders and Jorgenson are on the way
Talley charges out -- --   -- Talley wheels into a wide, spacious cul-de-sac lined with expensive estate homes, and pulls up behind another radio car
Anders and Jorgenson are crouched in the street -- Bullets snap into Talley's windshield, starring the glass -- Sonofabitch
Talley scrambles out of his car -- '  -- '  -- Talley takes cover behind his front wheel
Anders and Jorgenson are young guys; they've never worked a high-crime area; they've never made a felony arrest; and right now they're scared shitless
Mike Welch lies on the Smiths' front lawn, forty feet away -- Welch is down
They shot him
We think it's the three guys who robbed Kim's
Are civilians inside
He said something about a girl -- Holster your guns
Another shot cracks from the house as we hear the faint wail of approaching sirens
Talley edges around his car, trying to see Welch -- (') (calling) Mike
Mike, can you hear me
think he's dead
Don't shout, Larry
'm three feet away
Talley considers the situation and comes up with a plan -- (') We have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses
What are we going to do about Mike
Keep your head down
Talley scrambles back into his car
He backs up, then powers the car up the drive and onto the front lawn -- Talley roars to a stop between Welch and the house, using the car as a shield
More shots ping off his car as Talley climbs out -- How you doing, buddy
You still alive
Welch moans
His shirt is soaked with blood where the bullets caught him beneath his vest
Talley can't waste time
The siren is closer now -- (') Jesus
You hang on
Talley hoists Welch into the backseat, then dives behind the wheel
He fishtails off the lawn and up the street -- --  -- The ambulance waits as Talley powers to a stop -- He's in the backseat
Paramedics pull Mike Welch from the car as Talley gets out
He can see into the cul-de-sac from here, where Anders and Jorgenson still hunker behind their car
Talley keys his radio -- (') This is Talley
Who's on
His radio crackles with overlapping voices -- (') One at a time
Clear the air
(as they settle) Louise
Talk to me
What do we have
' Junior Kim was  at the hospital
Frantic voices once more overlap -- What about Mike
Is Welch alive
What happened
(forcefully) Quiet
want radio discipline
(as they quiet) Mike's hanging in
Larry, Jorgy
Listen up
' Go, Chief
Find out who lives at four-five-five
We gotta know who's in there
' Chief
Mike said a young girl answered the door
Did he say if she was shooting at him
' (hesitant) He didn't say
Then we don't know if she's part of this or not
Mickey, you up
' We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders
You see it
' It's right in front of us
Run a  on the plate for the owner's name
' pulled Mickey and Dreyer off the minimart
Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that
Put a unit out there
' We only have eight officers on duty, Chief
More sirens are approaching, but their help seems too little, too late
Talley stares up the cul-de-sac at the Smiths' house as if this was a terrible nightmare -- (to himself) That's not enough
What's that, Chief
Say again
Get everyone out here
Then call the Sheriffs
Tell them we have a possible hostage situation
'  -- Gunsmoke fills the air
Kevin is freaking
He throws a magazine at Mars -- We could've gone out the back
You didn't have to shoot
Stop it
They found the truck, Kev
They're already behind us
We should give up
All we're doing is making it worse
Get out of our house
Her voice cuts through the din
Jennifer and Thomas are huddled with their father on the floor, Jennifer's arms crossed to cover herself -- (softly) Quiet, Jen
Why don't they go
Why don't they leave us alone and go
Dennis charges up to her, screaming and waving his gun -- Shut up
Shut the fuck up
Walter Smith slowly stands -- None of you will get out of this
Dennis spins toward Walter, leveling his gun -- Stay down
Stay down, goddamnit
'm going to my desk
You're not goin' anywhere
Get on the fuckin' floor
Dennis raises the gun to Walter's face
Walter is in complete command of himself and nowhere near scared, but Jennifer grabs his legs -- Daddy, don't
(casually; to Dennis) Take it easy, son
'm only going to my desk
Walter eases past Dennis, who doesn't know what to do -- Get on the floor
have contacts in Los Angeles
Lawyers and judges who can help you
Walter slips open the center drawer
Dennis thinks that Walter might go for a gun
He screams louder and aims between Walter's eyes -- 'll fuckin' kill you
Daddy
Please
Walter checks that the computer disks are in the disk case
We can see their names clearly:   and
He drops the case into the drawer, then lifts out a thick booklet -- This is every criminal lawyer in California
If you give up now, right now, 'll buy you the best lawyer in the state
Dennis slaps the book aside, even more angry -- We just killed a cop
We killed a fat chinaman
We'll get the death penalty
Dennis suddenly screams at Mars and Kevin -- (') Mars, watch the cops
Kevin
Watch the back of the house
You won't die if you let me help
Bullshit
But if you stay in this house,  can promise you this -- (shouting over him) Shut up
Shut up and get on the floor
You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get
Dennis snaps
He swings the gun hard and smashes Walter on the temple
Walter drops like a rock
Leave him alone
Jennifer rushes to her father's side, but Walter's out cold -- '  --   -- Talley is at his car with Anders and two other officers, Leigh Metzger, a woman in her early thirties, and Cliff Campbell, a slender guy who looks like a retired security cop
Talley is getting information reports both in person and over the radio -- (referring to notes) The house belongs to Walter and Pamela Smith
They've got two kids, a girl about fifteen and a boy younger, Jennifer and Thomas
That would be the girl who opened the door
Are the others inside
The mother is in Florida visiting her sister
The father works at home, so he's probably inside
Talley keys his mike -- (into his mike) Louise
' Go, Chief
Get a phone number for the Smiths
' (from the radio) Chief, Mikkelson
Go, Mickey
' The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two
He has an Agua Dulce address
Contact the landlord
want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy
news helicopter swoops overhead in a tight turn
The cops look up -- What in hell is that
(grimly) News hawks
There'll be more
They monitor our frequencies
Talley realizes that his officers are staring at the helicopter as if they've never seen one; these people have never dealt with a crime this large, and have probably never even seen a felon
Talley keys the mike again -- (') Everyone be cool
That's our job right now--stabilize the situation and don't let things get out of hand
All we have to do is hang on until the Sheriffs take over
That's all we have to do
No one looks particularly convinced -- How do we do that
That's my job, Metzger
That's why  get the big bucks
Talley puts away his mike -- '  -- Jennifer and Thomas are bent over their father, wanting to help but not knowing how
Walter's eyes flicker as if he's dreaming, and the lump on his head is bleeding -- He's not waking up
He should be awake
Jennifer abruptly stands and faces Dennis -- (') He needs a doctor
Shut up and sit down
You think someone's gonna make a house call
Jennifer is scared--really, really scared--but she doesn't sit down
Both Dennis and Mars are staring at her
She feels naked and vulnerable
She crosses her arms again -- At least let me get some ice for his head
Dennis finally relents and shrugs at Mars -- Make sure Kevin isn't fucking off back there
Jennifer hurries out as Mars follows -- -- Jennifer goes to the counter
Kevin is at the French doors, nervous and scared; Mars is a dark shadow behind her -- She kneels to a low cabinet when Mars kicks it shut -- thought you wanted ice
Mars towers over her, his groin inches from her face -- 'm getting a wash cloth for the ice
Mars gazes down at her, enjoying his size and power
He steps closer, bringing his groin closer to his face
Jennifer stands, holding her arms across her breasts -- (') Please get away from me
(from the background) Mars
What are you doing
Kevin's intrusion shatters the moment
Jennifer quickly snatches a wash cloth from the cabinet, then takes an ice tray from the freezer and brings it back to the counter -- As Jennifer puts ice in the wash cloth, she sees the paring knife that she used for the sandwiches partially hidden by paper towels -- She glances at Kevin, but cannot see Mars; he's at the refrigerator behind her
Jennifer slowly reaches for the knife -- Hey
Jennifer freezes, terrified
She pushes the knife behind the Cuisinart to hide it, then turns
Mars is offering her a beer
(') Want one
don't drink beer
Mommy won't know
You can do anything you want right now
Mommy won't know
What  want is to help my father
Jennifer hurries past him and disappears down the hall
Even as she leaves the phone starts ringing -- '  -- The phone seems to ring louder here
Dennis stands over it, watching the phone as if it's alive
The phone rings again and again
Finally, he answers -- Hello
'  --   -- -- Talley is once more behind his car
He's on his cell phone, with Jorgenson nearby -- (into his phone) My name is Jeff Talley
Is this Dennis Rooney
Intercut Dennis on the phone in Walter's office -- You with the cops
The Bristo Police Department
Look out the window
You see the car
Dennis peers through the shutters -- Yeah
'm Rooney
We had an awful lot of shooting
You need a doctor in there
Dennis shoots a guilty glance at Walter, then lies -- We're cool
Let me speak to Mr
Smith
want to hear it from him
Fuck you
'm running this shit
You talk to me
How about your two friends
You don't have a man dying in there, do you
They're fine
Talley cups the phone to tell Jorgenson -- All three subjects are confirmed inside
Call off the house-to-house
(back to the phone) Okay, Dennis,  want to explain your situation -- (interrupting) You don't have to explain shit
That Chinaman pulled a gun
We wrestled for it
That Chinaman shot himself
Mr
Kim didn't make it, Dennis
He died
How about the cop
Dennis
want you to release those people
Fuck that
They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away
We're not coming in there by force, okay
No one wants to hurt you
got these people
You try to come get me, 'll kill every fuckin' one of them
The phone clicks in Talley's ear as Dennis slams down the phone -- '  -- Dennis is livid with fear and rage
He paces through the office like a trapped cat -- That fuckin' Chinaman is dead
That's murder-one, dude
That's the needle
Kevin appears in the entry, drawn by Dennis's raving -- (') Get back where you belong, asshole
Mars, keep and eye on the cops;  gotta find a way out of here -- Dennis shoves Kevin out of the office and stalks after him -- -- Kevin dogs along beside Dennis, speaking softly so that Mars doesn't overhear -- have to tell you something -- We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do
It's about Mars -- They reach the master bedroom suite, a huge room with sliding glass doors that overlook the pool -- (') That cop didn't pull his gun
Mars lied
He just started shooting
Bullshit
Why would Mars do that
was there, Dennis
saw
It's like he wanted to shoot that cop
You're being stupid
Check out the bathroom
Maybe we can sneak out a window -- Dennis shoves Kevin toward the bathroom, then steps into -- -- One side is filled with racks of clothes, but the opposite side is an industrial bank of video monitors showing a dozen views of the house, both inside and out -- Dennis sees this stuff and stops in his tracks, awed -- Kev
Kevin steps in beside him
Jesus
What is this
Are you totally stupid
What does it look like
One monitor shows Mars and the Smiths in the office, another the kitchen, another Jennifer's room, another the front of the house, the rear, the sides--every room and most of the exterior can be seen -- (') Look, that's the master bedroom out here
Dennis goes out into the master, looking for the camera, and appears on the bedroom monitor -- can see you
Dennis steps back into the closet, and this time he examines the door
He closes it enough to reveal thick throw-bolts -- Dude, this is solid steel
They gotta be hiding something
Dennis glances over to his brother, and finds Kevin on his knees with two black travel bags beneath the clothes -- Dennis -- Kevin pushes the clothes aside to reveal an open bag
It's filled with hundred dollar bills
Dennis kneels beside his brother and opens the second bag
It's filled with hundred dollar bills, too -- Go get Mars
'   --  -- We're watching a grainy black and white security tape of Junior Kim's robbery/homicide
It shows Kim behind the counter as Dennis and Mars enter -- One in front is Dennis James Rooney
Talley, Mikkelson, Dreyer, and Anders are watching the tape, which is currently being played in the home of Mrs
Estelle Pena, who lives two blocks from the Smiths
Mikkelson is a tall, strong woman; Dreyer is her opposite, a short, dumpy man -- (') Dennis has a younger brother, Kevin Paul-- that's him entering now, the third guy
Has Dennis done time
Just pulled thirty days for misdemeanor burglary
He shows car theft, shoplifting, and
Talley steps closer to the television, and taps Mars -- Who's this
We don't know
Have still prints made from the tape
Show the landlord
Maybe we can get a fast
Talley looks closer
With the way Mars is positioned, we can see part of the tattoo on his head -- (') Here on his head
Is that a tattoo
can't make it out
Says
burn it
On the tape, Kim slumps to the floor
Dennis vaults across the counter and runs to the door
Mars, however, calmly picks up Kim's gun and leans across the counter
We couldn't see this before, but now we see a strange smile play over his face -- What's he doing
He's watching Kim die
Talley watches Mars, and knows that this guy is seriously disturbed
He is still watching the tape when Leigh Metzger calls from the door -- Chief
Talley turns
Metzger is with Amanda and Jane -- '  -- Talley, Jane, and Amanda are walking to the street
Amanda is excited; she thinks this is cool -- Are men with guns really barricaded in a house
Just around the corner and up that street
See the helicopters
Five news choppers now hover high over the house
The crime scene is only two blocks away
Close
Wait by the car, Mandy
Give me a minute with Dad
They wait until Amanda is gone, then -- (apologizing) should've called
This thing broke right after we spoke, then everything happened so fast -- Don't worry about it
How are you doing
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here
But they're not here yet
Tell me about you
Jane touches his arm -- (') Jesus, you're shaking
Self-conscious, Talley moves away so that he's out of reach -- Why don't you guys grab some dinner at the Thai place
'll meet you there as soon as  can
You sure
don't know how long 'll be stuck here
'm in no rush
Maybe later we can talk
Talley gives her a gentle nod, then watches her walk away until -- Jane
She turns back, her eyes asking 'what
' (') 'm scared shitless
That's okay
love you anyway
Talley and Jane share the moment, and then she walks away
-- news chopper swings by overhead bringing us to the main entrance of York Estates
The entrance has been blocked, and cars are being turned away, so traffic is backed up both ways along the street -- '  -- Glen Howell is a nice-looking man in his early forties: Sport coat, gold Rolex, deep tan
He hammers the horn of his Mercedes S600 sedan, but it does no good; traffic is frozen -- news van trying to work up the line pulls alongside, then gets jammed by the crunch like everyone else
Howell rolls down the window -- Hey, you guys know what's going on
An attractive Asian-American reporter leans from her window to answer -- Three men took a family hostage
Jesus, no shit
My client lives in there
The reporter checks her notes -- It's a family named Smith, Walter and Pamela Smith
Do you know them
Howell stares at her emptily, then shakes his head -- No
No,  don't know them
Thanks for your time
Howell pulls a -turn to get out of traffic
He flips open his cell phone and presses the speed dial -- (') (into his phone) We have a problem out here
'  --   -- We're in a palatial home on the ridge overlooking Palm Springs
On the cut, Sonny Benza, Phil Tuzee, and Charlie Fischer are watching  news coverage of the situation in Bristo Camino -- Worst case, it's a bloodbath
The detectives come out with Smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass Go
Maybe Glen already picked up the disks
took the call from Glen personally
They're still in Smith's house
Fischer tries being positive -- Maybe we're getting too dramatic
It's three kids
They'll give up, the cops will arrest them, and that's that
Why would they search the house
You think we should take that chance
(on the spot) guess not
guess not, too
How much information is in the house
Smith was cooking the books for the
That means he has it all:  The cash flow, where it comes from, how we launder it, our split with the East
It's on two computer disks he calls Marlon and Al
What, he's cute
That's his idea of humor
If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too
You should let them know
No way
tell them, that Old Man is gonna handle this from back there
You should warn them, Sonny
Fuck them
Now get your head in the game, Phil--we have to handle this
Benza turns back to the television -- (') Put our people on the scene
Smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids
He knows better than that
Bullshit--a man will do anything to save his family
Who's running the show up there
They have a chief of police, a guy named Talley
saw him being interviewed
The television suddenly shows Talley making a statement
He looks tired and haggard -- (pointing) Hey, that's him
That's Talley right there
Benza studies Talley, then looks at his lieutenants -- Find out how we can hurt him
By the end of the day,  want to own him
It's happening right now
That's exactly what Benza wanted to hear
-- low-rent motel on the road between Bristo Camino and Newhall
Glen Howell's Mercedes is parked on the side, along with several other cars
It's late-afternoon going into evening
The sun is sinking fast -- '  -- Howell is being briefed by his operators, four men and two women
There's a minimum of bullshit; these people are professionals -- Ken Seymore is an intense, compact man who talks fast -- County Sheriffs are inbound from a bank robbery in Pico Rivera
Give me an
An hour, tops
Might be sooner
Duane Manelli speaks up -- When the Sheriffs get here, how many we looking at
(checking his notes) command team, a negotiating team, a tactical team--the tac team includes a perimeter team, the assault team, snipers, and breachers--thirty-five new bodies
How many locals
Gayle Devarona, one of the women, leans forward -- Fourteen officers and two civilians have their names and most of their addresses
She tosses a yellow legal pad onto the table -- And Talley
Married but separated, ex-
The fam doesn't live here, but they're coming up today
got his address there
The cops  talked to, they said Talley was a hostage negotiator in
His last three years on the job
Before that, he was
Mike Ruiz joins in -- How's a  negotiator make it up here to this shithole
make him for a stress release
Good work, Gayle--everybody
Now stay ahead of the curve
want to know everything that happens before it happens
'll cover Talley
Howell tears Talley's address off the yellow pad
This meeting is over -- What if it goes south
What do you mean
If things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end
You worry about your end
got my side covered
Howell tucks the address in his pocket and goes to the door
-- ,  -- The sun has set
The donut shop glows greasily at the end of a strip mall
It is empty except for the overweight woman behind the counter and a lone man seated at a window booth -- -- The man in the booth is named Marion Clewes
He's an average looking guy, more or less, except for the strange cant to his right eye and the thin black tie he wears over his white
Penney shirt
His jacket doesn't fit quite right, but not so much as you'd notice
Marion could disappear into a crowd just by being so ordinary
That's the point
fat black desert fly, heavy with juice and thorny with coarse hair, buzzes past -- Marion watches it, only his eyes moving -- The fly lands in the sprinkles of sugar on the table -- Marion watches it, then, suddenly, with no warning, his hand flashes out, slamming down on the table
He holds his hand in place, feeling for movement, then slowly peeks under his hand -- The fly oozes sideways, legs kicking, trying to walk
One wing beats furiously; the other is broken -- Marion examines his hand
smear of fly goo and a single black leg streaks his third finger
Marion touches his tongue to the smear -- The woman behind the counter watches this, her eyes widening with disgust -- Marion holds the fly in place with his left index finger, and uses his right to break away another leg
He eats this leg, too -- The woman disappears into the rear -- Headlights flash across the glass, and Marion swivels around to see Howell's Mercedes pull up -- Marion carefully pushes the still-alive fly aside as Glen Howell takes a seat across from him
Howell puts the yellow slip with Talley's address on the table -- Talley lives here
don't know if the place has security or not
It won't be a problem
He has a wife and kid
That's how we'll get to him
Okey-doke
We have to own this guy, Marion
We don't want him dead; we need to use him
Marion puts Talley's address into his pocket
Can we make him dead after we use him
Glen Howell slides out of the booth without answering
Marion creeps him out -- Whatever you want
Page me when you're done
Howell starts away, then turns back -- (') Donuts here any good
don't eat junk food
Howell frowns like he might've known, then walks away
Marion turns back to the fly -- It lays there, still, until Marion prods it
The remaining wing flutters -- Marion breaks off the remaining wing and eats that, too
-- Talley and Leigh Metzger stride through a pool of street light as she reports -- PacBell shows six lines into the house
They blocked all six like you wanted
have the only number that can call into the house
Yes, sir
They'll only accept calls from your cell
Way to go
They arrive at Larry Anders, who is waiting at his car with a slim, nervous cement contractor named Brad Dill -- Chief, this is Brad Dill
Dennis and Kevin work for him
didn't know anything about this didn't know what they were gonna do
Mr
Dill, these pricks didn't know what they were going to do until they did it
want you to take a look at something
Metzger holds out a still picture that was made from Junior Kim's security tape -- (') Can you identify this man
That would be Mars Krupchek
Jesus, he works for me, too
(to Metzger) Have Louise run the name 'Mars Krupchek' through  and
Tell her to list the tattoo as an identifier
Metzger hurries away as Talley turns back to Dill -- (') Is Krupchek an aggressive guy
Hot- tempered
Anything like that
Keeps to himself, more like
You have his address
Pretty sure  do
Yeah, here we go -- Dill pulls out a tattered address book
Talley hands the book to Anders, who copies the address -- (to Anders) Call the Palmdale City Attorney for a telephonic search warrant
When you get the warrant, have Mikkelson and Dreyer search his house
Yes, sir
Anders turns away as Metzger calls from Mrs
Pena's door -- Chief
The Sheriffs are ten minutes out
Talley has wanted to hear that, but now his sense of relief is tempered by something he did not expect:  Loss
Talley keys his shoulder mike -- (into his radio) Louise
' Go, Chief
Call Jane for me
She's at the little Thai place
' know the one
Tell her 'm almost home
'   -- Dennis is on the floor with the money, touching it, feeling it, smelling it
Mars is standing over him, profoundly unmoved -- There's gotta be a million bucks here
Maybe two million
Mars turns away from the money to consider the monitors and the door -- It's a safety room
If anyone breaks into your house, you can hide
Who gives a shit, Mars
Check out the cash
We're rich
We're trapped in a house
Mars walks away -- -- Dennis and Mars are returning to the front of the house, Dennis irritated at Mars's lack of enthusiasm -- We can take it with us
You can't run with suitcases
Dennis grabs Mars by the arm, stopping him -- Then we'll stuff it up our asses
This is the payoff
This is every dream you ever had, all in those two bags
Mars continues on without responding, Dennis angrily following -- '  -- Kevin is grimly watching news coverage of their standoff as Mars and Dennis enter
female anchor is reporting on the events at York Estates with Dennis's booking photo cut into the picture -- (from the tube) -- thought to be Dennis James Rooney
Rooney was recently released from the Antelope Valley Correctional Institute where he served time for robbery
Dennis spots himself on television and breaks into a big smile -- (thrilled) Check me out
look like fuckin' Jon Bon Jovi
Kevin is anything but thrilled -- Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis
We won't be able to hide
Jesus, first Mars, now you
You two need anti-depressants
Across the room, Walter Smith shudders and moans; his face is swollen and covered with clammy sweat -- Jennifer is sick with worry and can't stand seeing her father like this -- My father needs a doctor
Please
Hey, 've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed
All you're doing is watching yourself on Look at him
Use more ice
'm getting a doctor
Jennifer lurches to her feet and runs toward the front door
Dennis catches her in two steps and backhands her exactly the way his old man used to smack his old lady, knocking her to the floor -- Jen
Thomas charges into Dennis like an angry midget
Kevin jumps between them -- Stop it
Stop it, Dennis
Jesus
Mars steps forward and jerks Thomas into the air
Mars' physical presence is suddenly so imposing that everyone stops fighting -- (quietly) We should tie them
We can put them upstairs out of the way
It takes Dennis a moment to come up to speed with that, but then he nods -- That's right
That's a good idea, Mars
(to Kevin) Find something:  Extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight
Find something, Kevin
Don't just stand there
(waves at Walter) And tie this bastard, too
don't want him waking up and goin' Rambo on us
Mars nods his approval
Subtly, there is the beginning of a shift in power -- '  -- Mars pushes Jennifer inside
Kevin follows her with duct tape and a couple of extension cords
Mars, holding Thomas, pauses in the hall -- Tie her to the chair
'll take care of the windows when  finish with the boy
Mars disappears with Thomas down the hall
Jennifer stands by the chair, arms once more crossed over her breasts
Kevin can see that she's scared
He takes a -shirt from where she's left it on the floor and hands it to her -- Here
Put this on
She pulls it over her head -- (') You gotta pee
don't see why you can't just lock me in
It's not like  can go anywhere
Either 'm going to tie you or Mars will tie you
Which do you want
Jennifer sits
Kevin pulls her hands behind the back of the chair
As he ties her, Jennifer decides that if any of them can be reached, it's Kevin -- Thanks for the shirt
Whatever
Kevin, my father needs a doctor
He's just knocked out
've been knocked out
If my father dies they'll charge you with his murder
Can't you make Dennis see that
Kevin leans back
He knows she's right, but he doesn't believe he can do anything about it -- can't make Dennis see anything
shadow moves behind Kevin
It's Mars, standing in the door
He holds up a wicked claw hammer -- Look what  found
He enters and tests at Jennifer's binds -- (') You tied her like a pussy
Make it tight
As Kevin reties the bindings, Mars rips the phone from the wall
He smashes the phone jack with the hammer, crushing it
Then he goes to the window and drives a heavy nail into the sill, nailing the window closed -- Mars returns to Jennifer and once more checks her binds -- (') Better
He tears off a strip of duct tape and presses it over her mouth -- Make sure she can breathe
Mars rubs his fingers hard over the tape covering her mouth
He massages the tape into her skin, slow, sensual -- Go downstairs, Kevin
Jennifer looks at Kevin, her eyes pleading that he not leave, but Kevin is cowed; he leaves -- Jennifer looks back at Mars -- Mars leans close to her
She is terrified that he is going to kiss her, but, instead, he sniffs, smelling her -- (') want to show you something
Mars hooks the claw hammer under his shirt and lifts to expose his chest
large tattoo in flowing script is lined across his body:   Mother's Son
(') It cost two hundred forty dollars, but was happy to spend it
love my mom
You see these
Mars points out hard gray knots that speckle his chest as if he were diseased
He fingers the lumps sensuously as if touching them excites him -- (') My mom burned me with cigarettes
Jennifer is both disgusted and terrified
Mars stares at her emptily for another moment, then lowers his shirt and leaves without another word
'  -- The room is dark
Thomas is tied firmly to the bed
The cords cut into Thomas's wrists and Thomas can't reach the knots, but Mars made one mistake:  He tied Thomas to the headboard posts, and one of the newels has been loose for years -- Thomas stretches against the ropes to reach the newel, then twists it back and forth
He works it harder and harder until the newel slides off its pin, and suddenly his hand is free, though still tied to the newel -- Thomas peels the tape from his mouth, then unties the remaining binds and frees himself from the newel
He slips off his bed and crawls along the wall to his closet -- '  -- service hatch that opens into the attic crawlspace is built into the wall beneath Thomas's clothes
Thomas prys open the hatch, then reaches inside for a small flashlight
He flicks it on, then climbs into the eaves of the roof -- -- The crawlspace is a long triangular tunnel that follows the edge of the roof
It was built for plumbers and air conditioning technicians, but Thomas has taken the space for his own:  Witness the stack of Penthouse, pictures of sports heroes tacked to the rafters, and old soda cans strewn between the joists -- Thomas scurries quietly through the tunnel, heading for -- '  -- Thomas pushes through a hatch identical to the one in his own closet, then creeps to the door -- (whispers) Jen
'  -- Jennifer twists around to see him, mumbling through the tape -- Sit still
If they're in the security room, they can see you on the monitors
Jennifer quiets
Thomas slips out of the closet and creeps toward her along the wall -- (') figured out what these cameras can see last year when Mom and Dad went to Lake Arrowhead
It can't see me over here, but it's looking at you, so don't move
Thomas reaches up from behind Jennifer and jerks the tape off her mouth -- Ow
Shit
Be quiet
Listen
Thomas is hiding behind Jennifer so that the camera cannot see him -- No one's coming
That big asshole nailed my windows
Mine, too
We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs
Then we can run for it
No
'm not going to leave Daddy with them
Thomas thinks about that and decides that he can't leave their father, either -- We can't carry him
You go, Thomas
You get out, and 'll stay with Daddy
'm not gonna leave you
Go
If you get out, maybe you can help the police
Thomas suddenly realizes what he has to do -- We'll all go, Jennifer
All of us or none of us
know where Daddy keeps a gun
Jennifer jerks so hard that she almost tips over the chair -- (loud) You leave that gun alone
Shh, they'll hear you
(louder) Better than you getting killed
Don't touch that gun
Daddy says -- Thomas slaps the tape back over her mouth
Jennifer struggles helplessly as Thomas slips back into the closet, and is gone -- --  -- The Sheriff's Crisis Response Team rolls through the streets like an invading army:   brown sedan leads a huge van known as the Mobile Command Post, which is followed by a Sheriff's support vehicle, two  Suburbans, and four radio units
Pools of light from the helicopters follow their progress -- -- Talley walks out to meet the lead vehicle as the convoy stops
Up and down the row, uniformed Sheriffs pile out of their vehicles and off-load their gear -- Two people climb out of the lead car:  Will Maddox, a bespectacled African-American Sheriff's  negotiator, and Captain Laura Martin, the  commander -- 'm Talley
Who's in charge
Laura Martin
This is Will Maddox, the primary negotiator -- Is the perimeter around the house secure
've got fourteen officers on my department including me
We're as secure as we can be
(to Martin) Permission to deploy the line
Do it
(to Maddox) Don't crowd the house
The alpha's a kid named Rooney
He's amped up and volatile
Maddox turns away to bark orders into his shoulder mike -- Sounds like you know the job
've done it once or twice
blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him
(over her shoulder) Maddox
You got that
Doing it now
(back to Talley) 'd like you to brief my supervisors before we take over the scene
Whatever you want
Talley and Martin hurry toward her troops -- '  -- The garage is dark, lit only by the light that comes from the kitchen's open door, as Dennis, Mars and a reluctant Kevin enter -- Someone should stay with Mr
Smith
What if he wakes up
(annoyed) That's why we tied him, dumbass
Now come here and see this -- Dennis shows them a small casement window, and pushes open the window to reveal a thick hedge -- (') (excited) These bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard
All we need is some kind of diversion and we're home free
That's crazy, Dennis
The cops will see us
Not if they're looking at something else
Like what
Let's burn the house
Mars says it so simply that the moment is frozen
Mars is holding the big claw hammer, kneading it as if it was a living thing
His face is masked by shadows, but his eyes both glow as if already reflecting flame -- -- We see Dennis, Kevin, and Mars through a slit overhead as they emerge from the garage and move back into the house -- Thomas is watching them
He has cracked open the service hatch in the laundry room ceiling to make sure that his way is clear -- -- The room is dark
When Dennis and the others are gone, the ceiling hatch lifts, and Thomas lets himself down
He slides onto the washing machine and then to the floor -- Thomas cups one hand over his flashlight and turns it on
He lets light leak through his fingers so that he can see
The beam cuts across a door to the garage, car keys on key hooks, and Jennifer's purse hanging from one of the hooks -- -- This is a small room off the end of the laundry with a work bench, a stool, and shelves above the bench for Walter's hobby supplies -- Thomas shines the light over the shelves, spotting the hard plastic pistol case on the highest shelf
That's the target; that's the goal -- Thomas uses the stool to climb onto the bench -- -- Dennis is in the doorway to the security closet, handing out one of the money bags to Kevin -- We can't carry all this
It's too heavy
've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives
Kevin drops the bag and tries to reason with his brother -- Everything we're doing is making it worse
You can't let him burn this house
Dennis abruptly grabs Kevin by the throat, his face hard with fury -- Nothing's worse than listening to you
'm warning you, Kevin--stop holding me back
Now you pick up that fuckin' money and get ready to go
Dennis glares at Kevin another moment, then lets go and steps back into the closet -- -- Dennis lifts the second bag of cash when the monitors catch his eye:  The Sheriffs  unit can be seen moving into position
Dennis totally freaks -- They're coming
Kev, Mars, they're coming
Dennis drops the cash and bolts out of the closet -- -- Mars is placing two buckets of gasoline in the hall as Dennis and Kevin pound down the hall -- The cops are comin'
got the gasoline -- We don't have time
Dennis runs to the French doors
He sees lights at the rear of the property and  through the glass -- (') Get the kids
They're our only chance
Dennis   and runs for the stairs -- -- Thomas is straining to reach the pistol which is a fraction of an inch beyond his grasp when he hears Dennis shouting -- Thomas glances helplessly at the gun case--so near, yet so far--then scrambles off the bench and -- -- Thomas is climbing onto the washing machine when he once more sees Jennifer's purse hanging on a key hook -- Thomas jumps from the washer, grabs the purse, then scrambles into the ceiling as   through the house -- -- Martin, Maddox, and her supervisors are gathered around Talley when the gunshots crack across the neighborhood -- (startled) Who's that shooting
Martin, what's going on
Radio transmissions crackle over Martin's radio -- Shots fired
We are taking fire on the back wall
Talley immediately knows what's happening, and he knows why -- They're too close
told you not to crowd him
Pull back your people; do not breach that house
Talley sprints toward the cul-de-sac -- -- Thomas races through the narrow black tunnel
He slips off the rafters and almost falls through the ceiling
He's losing precious time -- -- Dennis and Mars pound up the stairs, getting closer to his room -- -- Thomas pushes his way into his closet -- -- Dennis and Mars reach the second floor -- '  -- Thomas scrambles into bed just before Dennis jerks open the door
Dennis drags him off the bed and carries him out of the room -- -- -- Talley, Martin, and Maddox run into position behind a Sheriff's unit where a deputy has set up the dedicated crisis phone -- Talley grabs up the phone -- (to the deputy) This thing good
Talley doesn't wait for the confused deputy to answer; he presses the button in the handle that dials the phone -- What in hell are you doing
He's shooting at my men
The phone rings in Talley's ear -- (to Maddox) Then get your men off the wall
(to Martin) You breach that house, we're gonna have a bloodbath
know this guy, Captain -- can talk to him
(to Maddox) Order your men to stand down
The phone is still ringing
Talley pulls the mike from the deputy's car and speaks over the public address -- (over the p
a
) Look out the window, Dennis
We are entering the house
We're pulling back
'  -- Dennis is holding Thomas around the neck, using the boy as a shield
Kevin is cowering on the floor and Mars is holding Jennifer
Dennis snatches up the phone -- (screaming into the phone) You fuck
got a fuckin' gun to this kid's head
'll kill'm, you fuck
Intercut Talley outside -- It's over now, Dennis
Don't hurt anyone
(still screaming) We'll burn this fuckin' place down got gasoline all over in here
Talley takes a deep breath; he forces himself to speak quietly, calmly -- No one's coming in
couple of guys out here got carried away
Dennis peers out the front
Talley's careful manner is calming him -- Goddamned right they got carried away
It looks like an army out there
Talley mutes the phone to speak to Martin -- (to Martin) It's over
He's cooling off
Talley glances at Maddox
Maddox nods, his expression saying that Talley was right -- Talley
(back into the phone) 'm here
want a helicopter to take us to Mexico
That's not going to happen, Dennis
They won't give you a helicopter
'll give you these people
The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed
There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us
(mutes phone; to Martin and Maddox) think we could make the transition now
Maddox, you good to go
Maddox nods at Martin; he's good to go -- (') (to Dennis) Hey, Dennis
Can  let you in on a personal secret
(hesitantly) What
gotta piss real bad
Dennis can't help himself; he laughs -- You're a funny guy, Talley
'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox
You talk to him for a while
Talley hands the phone to Maddox, who moves past Talley for a better view of the house
Talley looks grimly at Martin -- (') He says he has gasoline set to burn the place
Jesus
He must've siphoned it from the cars
If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs
The whole place would go up
(not without humor) Looks like you're bailing out at the right time
(returns her smile) That's why you get the big bucks, Captain
Talley is moving away when his radio pops -- ' Chief, base
(keying his shoulder mike) Go
' couldn't find Jane
She wasn't at the restaurant
You have her cell number
' She didn't answer
They might be at the house
Keep trying and let me know
'm going to be here a little while longer
Talley closes his phone and continues away -- '  -- Dennis and Kevin are at the television, watching an aerial view of the Sheriffs deploying around the house
Jennifer and Thomas are huddled by their father -- We're surrounded
They're all over the neighborhood
Mars enters carrying candles and flashlights
He lights a candle and place it on a table -- What the fuck is that
They'll cut the power
Mars tosses a flashlight to Dennis -- What about my father
Aw, Jesus, not more of this
Look at him
think he's dying
(to Kevin and Mars) Take'm back upstairs, but don't tie'm like before
That little fuck untied himself anyway
Dennis returns to the shutters as Mars and Kevin take the kids -- '  -- Mars shoves Thomas into the room, then lifts the claw hammer
For an instant, we think he's going to hit the boy--but he smashes off the door knob, instead
Mars glares at Thomas, then pulls the door closed
The knob on Thomas's side is gone; there's no way for Thomas to open the door
But that's okay by Thomas
He waits until he's sure that Mars is gone, and then he hurries back to his closet -- '  -- Thomas pulls open the hatch, fishes out his flashlight, then dumps the contents of Jennifer's purse on the floor
He picks up her cell phone
'  -- Talley closes his eyes with a blissful expression as a familiar sound fills the bathroom; he's taking a piss
His radio crackles -- ' Chief, base
Talley finishes his business, and keys his mike -- Did you find Jane and Mandy
' Could you call me back on your phone
Right away
What's wrong with the radio
' (hesitantly) Other people can hear us
Just call
Please
Stand by
Now Talley is worried
He pulls out his phone and punches the speed dial
It rings only once -- Intercut Louise, at her desk outside Talley's office -- (') Is something wrong with Jane
We have a boy on the line
He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house
It's a crank, Louise
'mon, don't waste my time with that
His cell number belongs to the Smiths think it's real, Chief
think this boy is inside that house
Talley worries it only for a moment -- Put him on
Talley pushes out of the bathroom into -- '   -- He flags Leigh Metzger as he cups the phone -- (to Metzger) Get Martin
Right away
As Metzger hurries away, we intercut Thomas, hiding in the shadows on his bed, whispering so as not to be overheard -- (') (into the phone) This is Chief Talley
Tell me your name, son
Thomas Smith
'm in the house that's on Dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up
You gotta help him
Talley can tell by the tremor in the boy's voice--this is for real -- Slow down, Thomas
Take it easy and talk to me
Was your father shot
Dennis hit him
His head's all big and he won't wake up
'm really scared
How about you and your sister
We're okay
Where are you right now
In my room
Talley hurries to a large sketch of the Smiths' floor plan laid out on the dining room table -- That's on the second floor
Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you
They nailed the windows
can't get'm open
Martin enters with Leigh Metzger
Talley cups the phone to give her the headline -- (to Martin) 've got the boy on the phone
He's using a cell phone
(back to Thomas) What was that, son
didn't hear you
If  try to climb out they'll see me on the security cameras
They would see you outside, too -- Thomas hears someone outside his door -- (') They're coming
Thomas hangs up, jamming his phone behind the bed -- Thomas
Thomas
Talley lowers the phone -- (') He says that his father's hurt
If we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in
They have security cameras
Rooney would see you coming
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger
No
He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying
Then  think we should wait
Do you agree
Talley finally nods -- You want me to stick around,  could -- You've been here all day, Chief
Take a break
See your family
If  need you, 'll call
Talley looks like the most tired guy in the world
He nods his good-night, then turns away -- '  -- Talley slides into his car outside Mrs
Pena's home
He's got a lot on his mind, and not all of it centers around 455 Castle Way
He punches a number into his cell phone -- He listens to ringing, and then his own voice answers -- ' This is Jeff Talley
Leave your name and number after the beep
We hear the beep, then -- (into his phone) Jane
If you're there, pick up, okay
Mandy
No one answers
Talley closes his phone, his apprehension increasing -- -- The Bristo officers manning the gate swing the blockade aside and wave Talley through -- -- The assembled television microwave vans, radio newsvans, and reporters are parked together in an empty lot one block from the front gate
Ken Seymore steps into the street, speaking into a cell phone as he watches Talley drive away -- (into his phone) He's leaving now
-- traffic light on the outskirts of town, deserted until Talley's car pulls to a stop -- '  -- Suddenly, two masked men point guns at his head, one from the driver's side, one from the passengers
They're wearing jackets, black ski masks, and gloves
The man on the passenger side sports a big gold Rolex, so we'll call him the Watchman -- (meaning the gun) Do you see the fuckin' gun
Look at it
Talley freezes
He's been blindsided by this insane shit, but he knows better than to move -- Take it easy
The man on the driver's side gets into the backseat, then the Watchman gets into the passenger side
The man behind Talley hooks an arm around Talley's throat while the Watchman searches for Talley's gun -- Where's your gun
'm the Chief
don't carry it
The Watchman nods at the backseater, who releases Talley
dark green Mustang roars up ahead of Talley's car second car tucks in tight on Talley's rear -- (') Who are you
Follow the Mustang
We won't go far
The Mustang pulls out, and Talley follows
-- The three cars turn into the alley
They stop, the first and last cars bumper-to-bumper with Talley's
The cars are so close to Talley that his own vehicle is pinned; he couldn't drive away now even if he wanted -- '  -- The Watchman puts Talley's car in park, turns off the ignition, and takes the key
know you're scared, but unless you do something stupid we're not going to hurt you
You understand
Two more masked men approach from the other cars, one coming to Talley's window, the other getting into the back seat behind the Watchman
(') Don't just fuckin' sit there, dumbass
Do you understand
What do you want
These guys are going to take hold of you
Don't freak out
It's for your own good
The three men take hold of Talley, the man behind again looping his arm around Talley's neck, the other two each twisting Talley's arms -- What is this
The Watchman holds a distinctive white cell phone to Talley's ear -- Say hello
' Jeff
Is that you
Talley goes berserk
He bucks and tries to pull away, but the three men hold tight -- The Watchman closes the phone -- (trying to calm Talley) know,  know--she's all right
Your kid's all right, too
'mon, now, relax
From this point on, you control what happens to them
Talley can barely breathe, they're holding him so tight -- (') Can we let go
You past your shock and all that, we can turn you loose and you won't do something stupid
You can let go
The Watchman glances at the men; they let go -- Here's the deal--Walter Smith has two computer disks like this in his house
They're labeled 'Marlon' and 'Al
' The Watchman holds up a thick black Zip disk
Talley's expression tells us that this is the weirdest shit he's ever heard -- Marlon and Al
We want them
You will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks
can't control what happens
The Sheriffs are running the scene
You will re-assume command
In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates
You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an  tactical team
The Watchman puts the white cell phone into Talley's hand -- (') When this phone rings, you answer
It will be me
'll tell you what to do
When  have what  want, you get your family
You want
Marlon and Al
have people in York Estates right under your nose
If you do anything except what 'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail
We clear on that
These disks
where are they
Smith will know
The Watchman and the others get out of Talley's car
The doors slam shut
The Watchman leans in -- When it rings, answer
The Watchman tosses the keys into Talley's lap
We hear car doors open and close; the cars, front and back, roar to life and speed away -- Talley focuses on the Mustang's license plate, frantically scratching down the number -- -- The place is deserted except for Louise, currently at her desk to monitor radio communications
Talley enters, looking as if he's stricken
Louise can't help herself but to react -- You look terrible
Chief, are you all right
Talley barely glances at her, going directly to his office -- '  -- Talley steps inside and peels off his uniform shirt
He takes a bullet-resistant vest and a black sweatshirt from his closet
He straps on the vest, then pulls on the sweatshirt
Talley sits at his desk and lifts out a ballistic nylon pistol case from the lower drawer
He takes out his old  combat piece:  This isn't a pussy 9mm; it's a finely tuned
45-caliber Colt Model 1911
One shot, one kill
Talley ejects the empty magazine, then loads it with a deadly efficiency
He slams home the magazine -- Talley clips the gun to his belt under his sweatshirt
He's ready to rock
The camera finds the photograph of Talley during his days as a  tactical officer -- He was one bad motherfucker
-- Talley heads for the front door -- 'm going back to York
Have Larry meet me at the front gate
Talley exits without a backward glance -- -- The helicopters orbit in the distance; the empty lot with the news vans is in the background
Talley turns into the development, then stops at the side of the street where Larry Anders is waiting -- '  -- Anders slides into the passenger seat
He sees a different Talley now, focused and grim -- What's up, Chief
Talley stares at Anders, trying to decide:  Can  trust him
Will he rat me out to the Watchman and cost the lives of my wife and child
(') Did  do something wrong
Talley gives him a slip of paper -- want you to run this license plate and phone number
Then  want you to find out everything you can about Walter Smith
The guy in the house
Go back to the office
Run his name through the  and the  database
think he's involved with illegal activity or he associates with people who are
Anders glances at the slip again, then tucks it away -- Wow
Sure, right away, Chief
Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs
You understand me, Larry
guess so
Fuck guessing
You keep your mouth shut
will, Chief
Absolutely
Get to work
Anders climbs out and Talley rockets away -- -- Talley pulls up behind the Sheriffs' command van
Martin, surprised to see Talley, steps from the van -- 'm re-assuming command of the scene
Martin is surprised and angry -- Excuse me
You requested our help
You turned over command -- And now 'm taking it back
We're getting Smith out of the house
Talley heads for the cul-de-sac -- '  -- Jennifer is on her bed in the darkness, groggy with fear and fatigue
She hears someone outside in the hall -- Thomas
The door knob rattles
Jennifer slides out of bed and goes to the door -- (') Thomas, is that you
The door suddenly opens, and Mars is framed in the dim light
Jennifer jumps back, terrified -- (') What do you want
We can't make the microwave work
That seems so outlandish that Jennifer is confused -- What
We're hungry
You're going to cook
Mars grabs her hair, and pushes her out the door -- -- Mars shoves Jennifer into the kitchen
Two frozen pizzas are waiting on the counter -- Make the pizza
want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine
(under her breath) How about dog shit
Mars takes a carton of eggs and a package of hot dogs from the refrigerator -- With hot sauce and butter
Jennifer takes a bowl from the cupboard
When she sets down the bowl, she sees the handle of the paring knife by the food processor
Jennifer breaks eggs into the bowl -- need a frying pan
Would you get one
Over there, under the range
As soon as Mars turns away, Jennifer palms the knife and pushes it into the waist of her shorts -- -- -- Talley joins Maddox behind the car -- What put a wild hair up your ass
changed my mind
That's all you need to know
Talley picks up the dedicated crisis phone that's been cut into the Smiths' telephone line
He lifts the receiver and presses a button
The phone inside the house rings -- Intercut Dennis inside Smith's office
He answers -- That you, Talley
The one and only
We got a little problem out here, Dennis
You oughta try on the problem  got in here
need you to let me talk to Mr
Smith
Dennis shoots a nervous glance at Walter, who's twitching and shuddering on the couch -- We been through that
Forget it
We can't forget it
The Sheriffs think you won't let me talk to Smith because he's dead
They think you murdered him
Maddox can't believe that Talley is saying this -- (low, so that Dennis can't hear) What in hell are you doing
That's bullshit
The guy's right here
He's alive
(pressing Dennis harder) If you don't let me talk to him, they're going to attack the house
Maddox grabs Talley's arm, his voice a low hiss -- You're gonna set him off, goddamnit
That's crazy
(screaming) They better not
Talley pushes Maddox away and amps the pressure on Dennis -- Help me keep them out
Let me speak to Smith, Dennis
Let me speak to him right now
Dennis is freaking
He believes that the Sheriffs are about to crash through the doors -- Now Talley throttles back; he senses that Dennis is at the breaking point and wants to coax him back from the edge -- (calmer; coaxing) Talk to me, Dennis
Help me help you
Why can't you put Smith on the phone
Dennis finally makes the admission -- (quietly) He got knocked out
It's like he's sleeping
He just lays there
Talley gives a thumbs-up to Maddox, who sits back in awe
This crazy shit is working -- (to Dennis) Now  understand
That helps
can make them understand that
Okay
Let me come get him
Fuck that
You bastards will jump me
If you won't let me come in, then put him outside
You'll cap my ass as soon as  step out the door
You've already helped yourself once, Dennis; be smart again
If you save his life, it'll help when you get to court
Dennis is at the edge; he's looking straight down into his deepest fears
He finally relents -- Fuck you, Talley, fuck you
You and one other guy, but that's it
want you stripped
gotta know you don't have guns
Dennis slams down the phone -- Talley lowers the crisis phone, then looks at Maddox -- Bring up the ambulance
-- -- Mobile banks of flood lamps illuminate the front of the house
The ambulance waits behind the lights; tactical officers with M5s and M16s hunker in position in case the program goes south -- Talley and a paramedic named Bigelow emerge between the lights, wearing only shorts and shoes
Bigelow is carrying a collapsable stretcher -- They stop in the mouth of the drive with a full view of the front door
Talley lifts his cell phone -- (into the phone) Okay, Dennis, we won't approach the house until you've closed the door
The front door opens, a crack at first, then wider
The line of officers behind the lights shifts -- (') (over his shoulder) Easy
Kevin and Mars waddle out with Walter Smith between them
They put him down about six feet from the front door, then return to the house -- (') (to Bigelow) Let's do it
Talley and Bigelow move forward
When they reach Walter, Bigelow opens the stretcher and locks out the frame
He peels back Walter's eyelids and flashes a penlight -- (') How's he look
He's got a concussion for sure
'm going to brace him
As Bigelow sets a cervical neck brace, Talley gets the creepy feeling that he's being watched
He turns toward the shutters, and finds a pair of eyes only inches from his own
It's Mars
Talley stares at Mars, and Mars stares back
It's as if they're locked in a contest of wills until -- (') Let's get him on the stretcher
Talley turns away to help Bigelow -- (') 'll support his head and shoulders
You lift his hips and knees
On three
Three
As they carry Walter away, Talley glances back at the eyes
Mars is still watching him -- ---- are surrounded by cops as soon as they step into the shadows behind the lights
Another paramedic takes the stretcher from Talley
Maddox is waiting with Talley's clothes -- You ready to tell me what's going on
Talley pulls on his pants -- No
Talley stalks straight to the ambulance, pulling on his sweatshirt as he goes -- -- young physician named Klaus is examining Walter as Talley steps up into the ambulance -- 'm the chief of police here
have to talk to him
Ain't gonna happen
We've got unequal pupilation
He could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both
Talley ignores the doctor and shakes Walter by the face -- Smith
Wake up
What are you doing
Stop that
Walter's eyes flutter, one more open than the other
Talley leans closer -- (to Smith) Wake up, goddamnit
Who are you
Klaus tries to shove Talley away, but it's like pushing a wall -- This man needs a hospital
Stop it
Talley grabs Klaus by the arm, trying to make him see -- Use smelling salts, give him a shot, whatever
just need a minute
Bigelow climbs behind the wheel and starts the ambulance
Talley pounds on the wall, shouting -- (') Stop the fuckin' engine
Klaus and Bigelow are both staring at Talley
Sheriffs and Talley's own officers have gathered at the open rear of the ambulance to see what all the shouting is about -- Klaus pointedly looks at Talley's hand gripping his arm
He speaks slowly, trying to make Talley understand -- 'm not going to wake him
don't even know that  can
Just one question
Please
He
Can't
Answer
Talley stares at Walter Smith
So close
So damned close
Walter knows about the disks
Walter might even know who has Jane and Amanda
But now Walter can't talk -- Talley turns away and climbs out of the ambulance -- -- -- As Talley emerges from the van, he pulls Metzger aside -- want you waiting in Smith's lap want to know the second--and  mean the second--that he wakes up
As Metzger hurries after the ambulance, a phone in Talley's pocket rings
He's startled and scared; it might be the Watchman
Talley takes out the Watchman's white phone, but it's not ringing
He answers his other phone -- (') (into phone) Talley
' It's me, Chief
Can you talk
Talley notices that Martin, Maddox, and the others are staring at him
He turns away -- (into his phone) What'd you find out
' The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills
The phone company shows no unusual -- (cutting him off) Dead end--it's a clone
What about the Mustang
' It was stolen
Talley lowers the phone in frustration, then -- You get anything on Smith
' Chief
it's like none of this exists
'm sorry
Keep trying
Talley pockets his phone
He watches the ambulance pull away, then strides back through the banks of lights to the nearest patrol car
He grabs the dash mike and keys the public address -- (') (through the p
a
) Call me
If you're safe, call me
Talley's voice echoes across the neighborhood
Every cop in the cul-de-sac stares at him
He has addressed the house for, apparently, no reason
Dennis shouts from his window -- 'll be safe when 'm outta here, you asshole
'm not talking any more
Talley drops the mike without a word and walks away -- '   -- Howell is on the phone with Ken Seymore, watching the televised news coverage with increasing alarm -- Was Smith talking
Intercut Seymore, who is reporting from the York front gate as the ambulance roars away, siren wailing -- heard he's fucked up
They're taking him to the hospital
Goddamnit, tell me what you know
Did the cops go in
Did Smith have the disks
don't know
Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out
He's fucking us over, Glen
That guy is fucking us over
What hospital
Canyon Country
Howell slams down the phone
He breathes deeply, taking a moment to center himself
He lifts the phone and punches a number -- have another job for you
-- Talley is by himself, pacing at the curb well away from the other officers
He is holding his cell phone
Waiting
Finally, it rings
Talley answers, listens, then -- Put him on
Intercut Thomas, phoning Talley in his room -- Is my daddy okay
The doctors are taking care of him right now
Thomas
are you safe
Can you talk
think so
need your help with something
But if you think those guys could catch you, then  don't want you to do it, okay
Okay
'm serious, Thomas;  don't want you to get hurt
What do you want me to do
Your dad has two computer disks
They have funny names:  Marlon and Al
He has lots of disks
think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office
Could you find them and see who they belong to
Dennis won't let me go to the desk
He makes me sit on the floor
Talley absorbs the bad news like his last best hope of saving his family is circling the drain -- (') But  might be able to sneak into the office if they're not around
Then could open the disks here in my room
thought they locked you in your room
can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house
Can you get into the office
can get into the den
The office is right across the hall
Talley thinks about what the boy is saying, and what he'll have to do to get Marlon and Al -- If  get Rooney into the back of the house, can you find the disks without being caught
Yes, sir
Talley glances toward the  Command Van as he comes up with a plan -- -- Martin, Maddox, and several of her supervisors are gathered outside the van as Talley approaches -- Martin sees him coming and steps away to meet him
She's pissed off and she wants answers -- want to know what in hell you're doing
'm looking for you
need your tactical unit
'm not stupid
You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out -- (interrupting) Don't question me, Captain
This is my crime scene
(shouting over him) -- then when you get him, you damn near assault the man in the ambulance
What is going on
Talley glares at her, half-a-heartbeat from going off, and then he throttles back -- (simply) 'm a negotiator, Captain
negotiate
That's all you need to know
Now are you going to help me or not
Martin weighs the determination in his eyes
She's angry, she's resentful, and she wants to knock Talley onto his ass-- but, instead, she glances back to her van -- Maddox
Let's give the man a hand
'  -- Dennis steps through the double doors that open from the entry and admires the room--rich paneled walls, soft leather couches and chairs, and a lush beaten-copper bar
Walter Smith's office is directly across the hall
Dennis saunters behind the bar, letting his fingers play over the copper, then pours a stiff Ketel One on the rocks
Kevin appears behind him, watching, as Dennis takes a seat on one of the leather bar stools, then peels a hundred off a thick roll and drops it on the bar -- (to an imaginary bartender) Keep the change, m'man
Dennis takes a deep drink of the vodka as Kevin approaches -- We're fucked
We're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich
There is no way out
For chrissake, please
Help me celebrate
figured it out
Celebrate what
Going to prison
Dennis enjoys another stiff belt -- No, dumbass--Talley
Talley's the guy who keeps us in here, and Talley's the guy who can let us out
Dennis grins as if he's discovered the wisdom of the ages -- (') Cops want to be rich like everyone else
All we have to do is share
(leans closer and lowers his voice) And if he wants someone to swing for the Chinaman, we'll give'm Mars
Dennis
Mars is standing in the doors, large and ominous
For an insane moment Dennis thinks that Mars has heard, but then -- (') The food's ready
Dennis grins, then shoves Kevin out of the room ahead of him, the three of them disappearing toward the kitchen as -- The camera drifts up to an air vent in the ceiling, through the slats in the grate to -- -- Thomas watches them leave through a hole in the air duct
When he's confident that they are gone, he continues along the crawlspace to a service hatch that opens down into -- - The "wine cellar" is a climate-controlled closet behind the bar fitted with floor-to-ceiling wine racks
The ceiling hatch lifts, and Thomas climbs down the racks to the floor
He eases open the door and peeks out behind the bar
The den is bright with light, and empty -- Thomas lifts his cell phone -- (whispers into the phone) It's me, Chief
'm in the den
'   -- Talley, Maddox, and several tactical officers are lined along the rear wall, watching the house
Talley, with a phone to his ear, is looking through a night-vision scope -- He can see into the kitchen through the French doors
Mars and Jennifer are inside, and, as we watch, Dennis and Kevin enter -- (into his phone) Okay, bud, here we go
Talley hands the scope to Maddox, then keys his radio mike -- (') (into his mike) Captain
Kill the lights
'  -- Dennis and Kevin are digging into plates of pizza and eggs when the house goes dark -- Shit
It's the cops
The backyard ; explosions from Starflash grenades and  over the swimming pool like New Year fireworks
It sounds like World War  -- Dennis throws himself behind the kitchen counter -- -- The house now dark, Thomas scurries to the double doors
He peeks around the corner to see if the coast is clear, then darts across the hall to -- '  -- The office is lit only by the flickering candles
Thomas checks his father's computer--no disks
He searches through the papers scattered over the desk, but finds nothing -- Then he opens the drawer -- The disk case that his father put there earlier is waiting
Thomas opens the case -- Marlon
Al
He found them
-- The Starflash grenades burn out as Talley's amplified voice echoes into the house -- ' It's time to talk face-to-face, Dennis
Come out, just you, and we'll talk
What's he doing
What's going on
Mars
They're trying to blindside us
Check the front
Mars lurches to his feet and hurries to the office -- -- Thomas is heading for the door when he hears footsteps coming fast toward the office -- Thomas reverses course and ducks under the desk
He pulls himself into a ball and tries not to breathe -- Mars is in the room
The desk is a great oak monster, big as a boat
It sits on curvy legs that leave a gap between the desk and the floor
Thomas can see feet -- The feet go to the windows -- ' What's going on out front
The feet turn toward the desk
Thomas tries to squeeze himself smaller -- '  (') Mars
What the fuck are they doin'
The feet come to the desk -- '  (') Mars
Something's happening
Get back here
The feet hesitate, then, finally, walk away -- Thomas scrambles from under the desk and darts across the hall -- -- Talley approaches the house
He can see flashlights moving in the kitchen -- Come on, Dennis
Talk to me
Dennis doesn't answer, so Talley moves closer
He spreads his hands wide -- (') 'm unarmed
'm looking at you
Get out here and let's talk
Dennis comes to the French doors
He stuffs his pistol into his pants, and opens the doors -- You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me
Only if you try to grab me
We could've shot you from the wall
Dennis considers that and accepts it
He steps out of the house and walks over to Talley -- (') You've been in there a long time
What're you waiting for
Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life
'd be trying to get the best deal that could
Maybe that's what 'm doing
Can  reach in my pocket, show you something
Dennis Rooney steps closer because he doesn't want anyone else to see the wad of money he pulls out -- (') That's fifty hundred-dollar bills
Five grand
They got money in this house, Talley, more than you've ever seen
Dennis pushes the money back into his pocket
(') How much would it be worth to you, getting me out of here
So that's what keeps Dennis in the house--money
This is the first that Talley has heard of the money -- You picked a bad house to hole up in, son
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know
Give up
There's a million dollars in there, maybe two million
'll give you half
Talley stares at Dennis, wondering how much to tell him and whether or not it will do any good -- The man you sent to the hospital is a criminal
He has partners
This is their house and their money and they want it back
These simple facts settle on Dennis like a funeral shroud-- everything that Smith said earlier now makes a horrible sense:  You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get
Dennis's eyes fill with defeat and helplessness -- It ain't been a good day, Chief
Give up, Dennis
Let these people go
At least you'll have your life
Dennis steps inside and pulls the door closed, the darkness in the house swallowing him like dirty water
The power is turned on
The house comes to life -- As Talley turns away, his phone once more rings -- '  -- Thomas is hunkered with his computer behind his bed so that the camera can't see him
got'm
Intercut Talley, now back in the cul-de-sac -- Can you open them
opened Marlon
think it's somebody's taxes
Look for names
Does it say whose taxes they are
Thomas scrolls through a spread sheet -- don't see any people names
It's all businesses
Try Al
See if you can open Al
Thomas changes disks and opens Al -- Yeah
Here's a name
This is somebody's personal tax -- Who is it
Charles
Benza
(then; noise in the hall) They're coming
Thomas abruptly hangs up and the line goes dead in Talley's ear
Talley recognizes the name as easily as an East Coast cop would recognize John Gotti, and realizes the stunning import of Smith possessing Sonny Benza's financial records -- Sonny Benza
Oh, fuck
Talley sprints across the cul-de-sac to his nearest officer, Jorgenson, and keys Jorgenson's shoulder mike -- (') (into the mike) Leigh
Metzger, answer me
' 'm at the hospital
Put a guard on Smith
want you with Smith until  get there
What's going on
Get in the car
Now
Talley drops the mike and shoves Jorgenson toward the car -- -- Marion Clewes is stepping from his car as Talley's police unit rips into the parking lot with flashing lights -- Marion watches Talley and Jorgenson rush into the , then he frowns and punches the speed dial on his phone -- (into his phone) We're too late
The police are here
-- Talley and Jorgenson huddle in the hall with Klaus and the supervisor, Dr
Estelle Reese
Metzger is outside Walter's room in the background -- 'm posting a guard outside his room, but we'll need help from hospital security
Is my staff in danger
Not with my officers here, no, ma'am
Metzger steps into Walter's room, then reappears -- Hey
He's waking up
Talley and Klaus press for the room -- '  -- Walter's eyes flutter open
His voice is slurred, but understandable -- Where am
Klaus peels open Walter's eyes, passing his penlight over one, then the other -- Canyon Country Hospital
Do you remember your name
It takes Walter a few moments to answer -- Walter Smith
All of Walter's memories come flooding back, and he tries to sit up
Klaus forces him down -- (') Where are my children
They're still in the house
Walter looks at Talley
He has never seen Talley and has no idea who he is -- (') 'm Jeff Talley, the Bristo chief of police
So far as we know, your children are okay
Chief Talley is the one who got you out
(to Klaus) need to talk to him
Alone
This time, Klaus is hard-pressed to refuse
He nods, then steps away -- Talley turns back to Walter Smith, and lowers his voice -- (') Sonny Benza has my wife and daughter
He wants the disks, Marlon and Al
He took my family to make me help
Talley's eyes fill
His tears drip on the sheets
Walter looks away -- don't know what you're talking about
He's going to kill you
Don't you know that
He can't take the chance that you'll talk
Klaus returns and places a hand on Talley's shoulder -- That's enough
Another minute
Please -- But when he looks back at Walter, he realizes that another minute will do no good:  Walter's eyes are once more closed
-- Talley is pacing by his car in the deserted parking lot
He pounds the hood, cursing, awash in rage and frustration -- And then a phone rings
Talley takes out the phones
The white phone is ringing
The Watchman's phone -- Talley answers furiously, the two of them instantaneously screaming at each other -- ' You dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up bad
Do you think 'm going to let you murder someone
' You want a blowtorch on your daughter's pretty face
'll go in that fuckin' house right now
'll give those disks to the real , you
And 've got Smith
've got Smith
profound silence fills the parking lot, both men now purged
When the Watchman speaks again, his voice is measured -- ' guess we each have something the other wants
guess we do
' My people are good to go
You know who mean
Your phony  assholes
' We're almost home, you and me
Keep your shit together
This isn't
What do you mean by that
' You don't want another dead child on your conscience
The line goes dead -- '  -- Dennis is pouring another stiff glass of Ketel One -- shouldn't have told him about the money
Now Talley is gonna keep it for himself
Kevin joins him at the bar
Mars is by the doors -- He said that
Dennis downs a big hit of vodka, then moves to the couch -- If we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash
That's how we'll stay alive
What are you talking about
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it
He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights
He's probably planning it right now
That's crazy
He's not going to kill us
Kevin, you're so fuckin' stupid
Kevin follows his brother to the couch and stares at him; Dennis has clearly lost his mind, and Kevin has reached the end of his rope -- It's over
We have to give up
Fuck it's over
That money's mine
That money's fucked up your brain
Talley's going to get tired of waiting for us to give up, and we'll all be fuckin' killed
Dennis tips his glass, like a toast -- Then we might as well die rich
'm not going to die for this
Kevin slaps the glass away
Dennis boils up from the couch
He grabs his brother and the two of them fall over the coffee table, Dennis hammering Kevin in a furious rage until he runs out of gas -- You're my fuckin' anchor, Kevin, the fuckin' lead around my life that 've been draggin' like a cripple leg
Dennis gets up and steps back -- (') Get this into your stupid head, Kevin
We're not leaving without the money
Beaten and whimpering, Kevin crawls away
Dennis watches him crawl out of the room, then looks at Mars -- (') You got something to say
like it here, Dennis
'm never going to leave
Fuckin'
Dennis returns to the bar
When he looks around again, Mars is gone--melted into the darkness
'  -- Jennifer is hiding in her shadows when her doorknob moves
She reaches pulls the knife from her shorts, keeping it hidden as she backs away -- Kevin steps inside, leaving the door ajar -- What do you want
Keep your voice down
'm taking you and your brother out of here
Jennifer now sees the marks and cuts on his face -- What happened
Do you want to go or not
'm offering you a way out of here
can't go without Thomas
All three of us will go, but we have to move fast
Mars and Dennis don't know 'm doing this
How can we get out
Dennis and Mars are in the den
'll get your brother, then come back for you
We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand
Yes
Kevin goes back to the door, then considers her
Maybe he wants to apologize for all this, but the best he can manage is -- Put on some shoes
Kevin slips out and pulls the door closed
-- As Kevin emerges from the room, he comes face-to-face with -- Mars
Mars is a great black shadow in the dark, only inches away
Kevin steps back -- You scared the shit out of me
was looking for you
Dennis wants you to watch the monitors
heard you with the girl
Kevin takes another step back, but Mars follows him, staying uncomfortably close -- It's over, Mars
If we stay the cops will kill us
Don't you get that
Mars seems thoughtful, steps aside -- get it
If you want to go, go
Kevin expected Mars to stop him, but Mars is letting him go
Kevin turns away and hurries down the hall -- -- Talley is returning to the hospital
As he turns into York Estates, he's stopped by one of his officers, Dale Cooper
Talley rolls down his window to see what Cooper wants -- Come  guys showed up, Chief
They said you were expecting them
They here now
You'll see'm up the street
Talley nods, and continues through the gate -- -- Two gray Econoline vans are parked at the curb beneath a street light, four men in the lead van, two in the rear
Talley pulls up behind them, then gets out of his car
He walks up the middle of the street to the lead van, eyeballing the men in the vans:  They all have short haircuts and are wearing black tactical fatigues
Some of them wear ball caps that say
You Talley
Yeah
The man in the passenger seat, Mr
Jones, gets out
He looks the part of  :  black tac fatigues, jump boots, buzzed hair
pistol hangs under his left arm in a ballistic holster -- Let me see some
Something with a picture
don't give a shit about your badge
Talley takes out his wallet and flashes his photo
Jones does the same in return -- (') Okay, here's mine
My name is Special Agent Jones
Are all of you named Jones
Don't be funny, Chief
You can't afford it
Jones slaps the side of the van
Doors open, and the remaining five men climb out
They strap into vests with emblazoned on the back, then pass out load-bearing gear, knit masks, and flash-bang grenades
(') In a few minutes the white phone is going to ring
So let's get our shit straight before that happens
You used to be a cop
All of you used to be cops
can tell by the way you move
Don't worry about what we used to be
How do you people expect this to work
The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team here
What's my name
What
asked you my name
You just saw my commission slip
What's my fucking name
Special Agent Jones
Think of me that way and you won't fuck up
'll handle the Sheriffs
The men at the second van are now passing out MP5s, -15s, and loaded magazines -- What are you people going to do
You and  are gonna straighten this out with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait for the man to call
When he gives the word, we move
What does he have on you
know why 'm doing this, but what does he have on you
One of the other men hands an MP5 to Mr
Jones
Jones jacks the bolt to chamber a round
He slings his gun without answering -- Let's go, Chief
Time to get real
Jones walks away, and all Talley can do is follow -- '  -- We're at the end of a gravel road in the low foothills of Pearblossom, a farm community of fruit orchards in the low foothills
Bristo Camino police car pulls up outside a thirty-foot Caravan trailer, and Mikkelson and Dreyer get out
Mikkelson lights up the trailer with the radio car's spotlight -- Krupchek lives in a shithole
The trailer is dark and silent
They walk to the door carrying their Maglites
Mikkelson tries the knob -- guess we could jimmy it
don't want to pay for breaking it
Mikkelson pulls hard and the door pops open
Both officers cringe as a smell like simmering mustard greens rolls out at them -- Christ, that stinks
-- Mikkelson switches on the lights as they step inside
Dreyer sees it first -- Mickey
Look at this shit
Mikkelson joins Dreyer in the trailer's tiny kitchen where teetering stacks of folded cereal boxes fill the counters and sink and floor
Hundreds and hundreds of Captain Crunch and Count Chocula boxes, all neatly folded and stacked -- (') He's burned them
What
Dreyer shows her a box
The nose of each character has been burned with a cigarette -- He burned their noses
Okay, this is creeping me out
Mikkelson opens the oven
It's empty
She opens a cupboard
It's filled with large glass jars
She opens another cupboard
More jars
Shapes float in the jars, suspended in yellow fluid
Mikkelson and Dreyer examine the shapes -- What are those, rats
Mikkelson opens the fridge, then slams it, looking like she wants to puke -- Ohmigod
We gotta call Talley
Dreyer sees the expression on her face, then looks at the fridge, wondering -- -- -- Talley, Jones, and Jones's phony "" team are moving down the cul-de-sac toward the house with Martin at their heels -- Walter Smith is in the Federal Witness Protection program
When Washington learned about the situation here, they asked Chief Talley for his cooperation
This is bullshit
should've been notified
'm sure you will be, Captain, but it's after midnight
Now, if you'll pull your people off the perimeter,  want to get my people in position
Martin looks like she wants to spit bullets -- Let it go, Captain
Goddamned small town bullshit
Martin relents and stalks away just as Talley's phone rings
Both Talley and Jones tense at the ring, thinking it might be the white phone, but it's not -- It's mine
(into his phone) Talley
' Chief, it's Mikkelson
Go, Mickey
'  -- Both Mikkelson and Dreyer are leaning against their car
They look shellshocked
Mikkelson is making the call -- Chief, we just found Krupchek's trailer
We just went in there
She trails off and looks at Dreyer for help:  How do  say this
Dreyer, at a loss, looks away -- (') He has human body parts in his refrigerator
He has five human heads
Mikkelson can't handle it any more
She lowers the phone -- The shock that Mikkelson is feeling sweeps over Talley as well
He takes a moment to get his head around this -- (into his phone) Mickey
Call the state Homicide Bureau
Don't touch anything, just sit back and wait
' Yes, sir
Talley lowers the phone as he stares at the house, wondering what sort of monster is in there with Thomas and Jennifer
His gaze shifts to Mr
Jones, who is watching him -- We're getting those kids out of there
'  -- Dennis is sprawled on the couch, sucking the last few drops of Ketel One from the bottle
He frowns at the empty bottle, then lumbers to his feet -- (calling) Kev
Key, Kevin, c'mon back
'm sorry hit you
Dennis weaves through the door, carrying the empty bottle like his dearest friend -- -- Dennis staggers into the kitchen -- 'mon, Kev, don't fuckin' pout
You're right
It's time to call it a game
' Kevin left
He didn't want to be here anymore
The voice from the other side of the kitchen startles him
Mars steps out of the shadows -- You mean he left, as in went out the front door
overheard him with the girl
Shit
That fuck
Even when  want to turn myself in he screws it up
Did he take the kids with him
don't know
Jesus, get upstairs and find out
If he took those kids, we're fucked
Mars cross the kitchen and goes for the stairs without another word -- (') You
Dennis throws the bottle across the room -- -- Thomas is scared by all the shouting, but he waits in the darkness until Dennis quiets, and then we notice that he is no longer in his room; he's in the hobby room, once more trying to reach the gun -- Thomas stacks two phone books on the bench, then uses the phone books as an extra step to reach the high shelf -- He can finally reach the gun case
He puts it on the bench, then climbs down, and opens the case
Thomas is bouyant with confidence; now, he can protect himself and his sister
Thomas shoves the gun into his pants and creeps back into -- -- Thomas is climbing onto the washing machine when his foot slips and he bangs his head -- It's so dark in ehre that Thomas can't see what made him slip, but he tests the floor
His shoe makes a tacky sound
Thomas cups his hand over his flashlight like before, and turns it on
dark liquid like oil is spreading on the floor
Thomas follows it with his light to the broom closet
He lets out more light and sees that the oil is red
Thomas knows that something terrible is behind the door, but he is drawn to it
He reaches out -- Kevin's lifeless body topples out, collapsing in a heap at Thomas's feet
His neck is cut so deeply that his head is almost severed -- His eyes are open
Thomas screams
'  -- Jennifer is anxiously waiting for Kevin
When she hears someone in the hall, she thinks that it's Kevin, but when the door opens -- It's Mars
He steps inside, tall, wide, and massive as a bear
He's carrying the claw hammer
Jennifer backs away -- Kevin left without you
don't know what you're talking about
Mars turns off the lights
(') Don't do that
Turn on the lights
Jennifer grows even more frightened
Mars follows her across the room until she backs into the window -- (') You'd better get out of here
Kevin's coming back
Kevin's gone, your daddy's gone, everybody's gone
When Mars reaches her, he touches the hammer to the chest, pressing to make it hurt -- (') Now we can do whatever we want
Stop it
Mars rakes the claws slowly between her breasts as Jennifer finds the knife in her shorts
She jerks free the blade and stabs blindly burying the knife high in his chest, but Mars doesn't even step back -- He grips the handle, moaning hideously as he pulls out the knife
red flower blossoms from the wound
Jennifer tries to get past him, but he grabs her throat and pins her to the wall -- You're going to enjoy this
He raises the knife to her face -- -- The scream from the laundry room having scared the shit out of Dennis, he has his gun out -- Who's that
Goddamnit, who's there
Dennis turns on his flashlight and sweeps the beam across the kitchen -- (') Kev
Is that you
Talley
Dennis weaves across the kitchen, pushing the gun ahead of him -- (') Kevin, if that's you, say something
Mars said you left
Dennis steps through the door into -- -- Dennis shines the light on the floor and sees the red ooze
He follows the blood to Kevin's body, but even then doesn't realize what he's seeing -- Kevin, what the fuck
Get up
Dennis steps closer, and now he sees the open neck, the grotesque white bone within the flesh -- Only one other person in the house could have done this -- (') Dennis hears Jennifer screaming upstairs -- (') Dennis rushes from the room -- '  -- Dennis slams through the door so heard that the door crashes into the wall
Mars is across the room, still holding Jennifer by the neck -- Dennis aims his gun -- You're dead, you fuck
Mars calmly pulls the girl in front of him, blocking Dennis's aim
What's wrong, Dennis
Why're you so pissed off
It's weird the way Mars is acting, so calm and all
But Dennis can see the feat in Jennifer's face and her swollen eyes
She manages one word -- Please
Dennis tries to aim past her -- This fuck killed Kevin
There's blood everywhere down there -- Jennifer sobs
And when she does -- Mars charges across the room holding Jennifer like a shield
Dennis hesitates only a heartbeat, and then it's too late -- Jennifer crashes into him, the full force of Mars's weight behind her, knocking Dennis backward into the hall -- -- They fall through the door into a tangle on the floor
Mars raises the hammer, then brings it down, smashing Dennis over and over -- '  -- Thomas emerges from the closet to see the carnage in the hall:  Mars over Dennis, grunting like a pig as he turns Dennis into pulp, and Jennifer crawling away, splattered with blood -- Thomas pulls the gun from his pants and darts past Mars into the hall -- -- Thomas grabs Jennifer's arm and pulls her toward the stairs -- 'mon, Jen
Run
Mars heaves to his feet and turns after them -- Thomas jerks up the pistol with both hands -- (') 'll shoot you
Mars stops, blood dripping from his face and hands and the hammer
Jennifer pulls her brother -- Keep going
They back toward the stairs, Thomas trying to hold the gun steady
Mars follows, spreading his arms wide as if to embrace them -- Everyone's gone
We can do whatever we want
We can do anything
'll shoot you
'm not kidding, you better stay away
Mars keeps coming -- Thomas pulls the trigger
Click
Mars stops, frozen by the sharp sound -- Thomas pulls again
Click click click -- No bullets
Run
Thomas and Jennifer sprint for the stairs -- -- Jennifer and Thomas crash down the stairs and spill into the entry
Thomas goes to the front door but Jennifer pulls him away -- No
They have everything nailed
They race away down the hall just as Mars reaches the bottom of the stairs -- '  -- Mars is closing
Jennifer and Thomas scramble through the bedroom only paces ahead of him
They run straight into -- -- Jennifer and Thomas slam the door and throw the bolts just as Mars crashes into the door -- Jennifer and Thomas have made it
They are shaking and scared, but they are safe
He can't reach us in here
We're safe
know
Mars pounds on the door with the hammer
They can see him on the monitors
Slow rhythmic pounding
Then he walks away -- What's he doing
They can see him on the monitors--moving through the hall, going into the entry
Mars picks up a bucket of gasoline
He splashes gas on the walls and floor all the way back to the bedroom, and then he empties the bucket on the security room's door -- Mars looks up at the camera again and takes out a match
He flicks it with his thumbnail and it flares -- (') Ohmigod, he's going to burn us
Mars tosses the match, and the room erupts into flame -- -- -- Talley is arguing with Jones, trying to convince the man that they need to move into the house now -- We've got to get those kids out of there
Not until the man calls
Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath
He kills people
They've been in there all day
Talley's phone rings
Again, they both think that it's the white phone, but instead it's Talley's personal phone -- (into his phone) Talley
It's Thomas
His voice cuts in and out, broken by static -- ' Mars killed Kevin and Dennis
We're in the security room
He's burning the house -- Thomas' phone cuts out
Talley turns toward the house and sees a growing column of smoke
He looks back at Jones -- You do what you have to do; 'm getting those kids
Talley hurries away
Jones stares after him, then comes to his own agonized decision
He catches up -- Talley
We'll secure the house, but then we get the disks
Talley accepts that; they move toward the house -- '  -- The banks of floodlights abruptly shut off, plunging the house and grounds into darkness -- -- The fire is spreading, following the gasoline trail through the hall and the rest of the house; a thick layer of smoke covers the ceiling -- Mars sees that the outside lights have been turned off, and senses that the cops are making their move
That's all right with Mars--he's been waiting to die for most of his life -- Mars checks the load in his pistol, then melts away into the dark -- moment later, throbbing music pounds the house -- '  -- Talley and Jones slip up to a side window at the front of the house
Both are carrying fire extinguishers
They peer inside, then Jones uses a pry bar to lift the window -- -- Talley enters first, followed by Jones
The air is thick with smoke, and the music is confusing; the hall outside the room is filled with flames -- Talley points toward the bedroom, then uses hand signals to countdown the launch--three
two
one -- Jones keys his throat mike to launch the strike -- Go -- They blast the flames with their fire extinguishers, then plunge into the hall -- -- The sliding glass doors shatter as one of Jones's men breaches the door
As he rolls to his feet, Mars shoots him from the flames -- second man rolls through the door, and Mars shoots again, laughing as the man writhes in flames -- -- fight back the flames with their fire extinguishers, working their way into -- -- It's an inferno as Talley and Jones come through the door
They spot the two men on the floor just as -- Mars rears up behind the flames
He is shirtless and glistening, screaming maniacally is he fires his gun -- Talley and Jones fire in unison, pounding Mars with bullets and knocking him into the fire
Mars thrashes and screams, burning alive -- Talley hears pounding inside the safe room:  Jennifer and Thomas
He fights his way to the security door, which is covered with flames -- The kids are in here
Where's the office
Help me, goddamnit, we can get the disks later
Talley expects that Jones will help, but Jones is aiming his gun -- We don't need you any more, Chief
We can get the disks on our own
But before Jones can kill Talley, Mars heaves himself up from the flames, firing wildly
He hits Jones in the head -- Talley fires reflexively, his powerful
45 kicking Mars across the room and out the glass doors
Talley turns back to the burning door and douses the flames with his fire extinguisher -- Thomas
Thomas, it's me
Thomas and Jennifer jerk open the door, but shrink from the heat
Talley uses the last of his fire extinguisher, then pulls them into his arms -- (') Stay close
We're going to move fast -- -- Talley shepherds Jennifer and Thomas past the flames -- -- They reach the entry, and Talley uses his pry bar to break open the door -- wall of cops are out on the street, waiting -- (to Thomas) Are the disks still in your room
No
They're right here -- Thomas pulls Marlon and Al from his pocket -- Talley clutches the disks and pulls the boy close in a spontaneous hug
They run out the door as we -- : '   -- Walter is resting comfortably when Talley steps up beside his bed
Talley is a mess--smokey, dirty, greased with sweat -- (quietly) Smith
Walter opens his eyes, then Talley steps away
Jennifer and Thomas are standing behind him
They rush to their father -- / Daddy
Thank God
Are you guys all right
You're not hurt
Our house is on fire
We almost burned
Both children burst into tears, and Walter hugs them
He looks up at Talley, then gently eases his kids away -- (to Jennifer and Thomas) You guys step out for a second
have to talk to the Chief
Walter waits until his children are gone, and then -- (') Did you find the disks
Yes
Then you have everything
You can put them away
(touches his wrist) man has my family
Gold watch here
Dark tan
That would be Glen Howell
He was on his way for the disks
How do  reach him
-- Talley is alone in his car, his phone to his ear, listening to the ring at the other end of the line
familiar voice answers -- ' Hello
Two words:  Glen Howell
Intercut Howell in his motel room
He is thrown by getting this call -- How did you get this number
Mr
Jones is dead
So are two of his men
The other three are in jail have the disks
have Walter Smith
And you know what, you motherfucker have you
have your fucking family
Don't forget that
also have a couple of million in cash
Call Sonny Benza
Ask if  can keep it
This throws Howell, too
He didn't expect anything like this; not from Talley -- What do you want
My wife and my daughter and the money
'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family
We'll trade
Fuck that
You think 'm crazy
think you got no choice
Howell thinks about it
It's a tough call because Talley might be setting him up, but they're playing even hands-- Talley still has the disks -- Fuck the mall
You know that motel on the road west of town
Yeah
You got ten minutes
If you're one minute late, we won't be here to find
Talley tosses his phone aside, then drives away -- -- graphic identifies our location:  New York City
'  -- Victor Castellano is "the old man" that Benza's people have mentioned
He is not a happy man in the best of circumstances and is even less happy now -- Castellano's assistant, Jamie Beldone, is briefing him on events in the West -- The house is in flames, Benza's accountant is with the cops, and they're stacking the bodies like cordwood
Jesus Christ, it's a clusterfuck
You wanted to let Sonny handle it would've moved in when we first found out
Castellano scowls at the younger man -- And by doing so, he would've known we have spies in his organization
(embarrassed) Yes, sir
But what about the disks
If the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat
hate that Mickey Mouse bastard hated his father, and  hate Sonny, too
Always with the tan
What do you want to do
Our people out there, they good people
People in the right place
The best
Sonny's a fuckup
If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on
But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses
understand
want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed
'll make the call
Vic Castellano watches Beldone depart as he considers what is about to come -- -- The motel floats like an island of light in the middle of nowhere
few cars are scattered throughout the quiet parking lot -- is hiding in weeds across from the motel, keeping an eye on the road for Talley's approaching vehicle
radio transmission crackles quietly -- ' You see anything
Ruiz keys the mike -- Not yet
Talley steps silently behind him and presses his gun to Mike Ruiz's ear -- Buster is on the dark side of thge parking lot, standing watch outside the pool of light in the shadows -- Gravel crunches behind him; Buster turns, and -- Talley cracks him across the face with his
45 -- He edges along the perimeter of the parking lot, working as close as he can to a Fat Man who is leaning against the green Mustang -- The door to a ground floor room opens, and Glen Howell steps out
Talley recognizes Howell from the big gold watch -- (to the Fat Man) Keep your eyes open
He should've been here
Howell returns to the room
The Fat Man steps away from the Mustang, and -- Talley slams into his blindside, using the
45 as a club
The Fat Man staggers, and Talley wraps an arm around his neck in a choke hold, running him at the door -- Talley rams the Fat man into the door, knocking it open and shoving the Fat Man through -- '   -- Talley explodes through the door with the Fat Man in front of him like a shield -- (screaming) Police
Glen Howell jerks out his pistol as he drops behind the bed
Duane Manelli rolls out of a chair, aiming from the floor in a two-handed grip -- Don't shoot
Don't shoot him
Talley shifts his aim back and forth between the two men
He has his back to the wall and the Fat Man in front of him -- Where's my family
Where's my family, you fuck
All three men are sucking air like freight engines
No one is shooting, but if one person fires, everyone will fire
Everybody has something the other guy wants
That's the only thing holding them back -- Take it easy
Just take it easy
We're here to do business
You said they would be here, goddamnit
Where are they
Howell releases his grip on the gun, and lets it swing free on his finger
He's trying to cool Talley -- They're close
Let me make a call
You can see they're okay
You said they would be here
Howell takes out his phone and presses a number
Talley shifts his aim from Howell to the Fat Man to Manelli -- (into the phone) Put on the woman
Howell offers the phone, but Talley is wary--he can't let go of the Fat Man and he won't put down his pistol
Howell carefully holds the phone to Talley's ear -- (into the phone) Jane
' Jeff, we're -- Howell backs away with the phone -- You have the disks
Talley takes out a single disk
It's the one labeled 'Marlon
'  He tosses it onto the bed -- You get the other one when  have my girls
Not talk to them; have them
Where is it
Close
Howell considers the disk
If Talley has the second disk in his pocket, Howell could just shoot him
But Howell can't be sure -- have to see if it's real
Howell brings the disk to a lap top computer set up in the corner
He inserts the disk, and waits for it to read
He's satisfied with what he sees -- (') All right
Now the second one
First my girls
get my girls, you get the other disk
Howell stares at Talley again, then picks up his phone -- (into the phone) Bring them
Stop the car outside the room, but don't get out
The car pulls up directly outside the door
It was only seconds away
Marion Clewes is driving; Jane and Amanda are wedged into the front seat beside him, Jane next to Marion, Amanda on the far side
They are bound tight with their mouths taped, immobile and helpless, their eyes wide with fear -- (') (into his phone) Aim your gun at the woman's head
If he doesn't give me the disk, kill her
Marion presses a gun to Jane's temple -- Talley jerks his gun toward Howell -- 'll kill you
You won't get the other disk
If you shoot me, he'll kill your daughter
Do you want to lose both of them
Talley aims at the man in the car; he aims at Howell
He tried so hard to save his family, and now Howell has him boxed -- (') The negotiation is over, Talley
won
Now give me the disk or he'll put her brain on the glass
Talley looks at Jane and Amanda, and his eyes fill
He mouths the words -- love you
He's saying good-bye
Talley drops his gun and releases the Fat Man, who stumbles away
Talley tosses a second disk onto the bed
Manelli scoops it up and tosses it to Howell as Mation appears in the door -- (') gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the real
This one's a fake
You'd better be kidding
Howell anxiously pushes the disk into his lap top -- 'm a cop, you asshole
What did you expect me to do
Pretend all this never happened
Howell stares at the lap top with the withering face of a man reading his own death sentence
There is nothing on this disk
(') Benza's over
You're over
just want to take my family home
Howell stands like a mechanical man; incredulous -- Are you out of your mind
(quietly) You fucked up, Glen
Howell looks over as if seeing Marion for the first time, and gives him the order -- Kill them
Marion aims his gun directly between Talley's eyes, then points it at Howell -- No fuckups allowed
Marion shoots Howell in the head, then the Fat Man, then Manelli--bambambam--one shot, one kill
He lowers his gun, considers Talley
Talley doesn't move
(') It's like a storm, isn't it
This raging force that you can't control does whatever it wants, and the best you can do is survive
winner survives
Why
The question being:  Why aren't  dead
Why aren't you killing me
What good would it do to kill you
The police already have the disk
Marion considers Talley another moment -- (') Your wife is a very nice lady
Marion goes to his car
He helps out Jane and Amanda, then gets into his car and drives away
-- Talley stumbles out of the room and runs to his family
He scoops up Jane and Amanda, hugging them tightly as the camera pulls up and away, rising, leaving this reunited family as Marion Clewes disappears like a passing thunderhead -- The credits roll to black, then-- '  -- The garage door slides up
Benza backs out in his Mercedes, then roars to the front door
He pops the trunk, then gets out and hurries to the front door
He sticks his head inside and calls to his wife -- The fucking jet's waiting
Would you get your shit out here
He picks up two bags from inside the door and brings them to the car -- Benza steps behind the raised trunk to put away his bags
When he steps back around again, a nondescript sedan is waiting in the drive -- No fuckups allowed
Gunfire erupts on the quiet ridge above Palm Springs
