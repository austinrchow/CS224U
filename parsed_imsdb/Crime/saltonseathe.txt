) Maybe not

Maybe that's why it took two bombs to get 'em to surrender nuclear blast is just a minor nuisance to a determined tweaker

Suddenly

) '
- Danny and Jimmy the Finn walking towards the front door
How the hell did we get this detail
Guess it's our turn
Danny nods
What time is it
Twelve Midnight
- As the door opens, Danny discovers that it is   and the sun is blazing
The party house is revealed as a cheap stucco apartment building crammed in the middle of    at a major intersection
Jimmy and Danny slip on sunglasses and brave the light
Where to
know a guy
Lead the way
They slink along like two albino rat vampires with sunglasses
Nice day hadn't noticed
(beat) 've seen you around
What's your name
Jimmy
Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn
Why's that
My features
They're Finnish
You don't say
Finland is a country
Well, Jimmy the Finn, let's go score some gack
- Danny and Jimmy standing there looking at something
Danny and Jimmy looking at one another, then back at what they were looking at
sitting on the bed in his underwear, looking down at his left arm and holding a can of   at the ready in his right hand
He is completely motionless, studying his arm with hypnotic intensity
Bobby
Shhh
Bobby never takes his eyes off his arm
(cont'd) (whispering) They're coming
(likewise whispering) What
The spiders
Bobby readies the can of bug spray, his eyes widening
(cont'd) (sing-song) 'm ready for you this time
Bobby lets loose with the spray, dousing his arm
Aha
Yeah
(super rapid-fire) You thought you could fuck with Bobby, you thought you could fuck with Bobby, you thought you could fuck with Bobby
Bobby's mouth wide with stupid joy and continues to cloud the air with bug spray
(cont'd) With Bobby you thought you could fuck
Danny and Jimmy wait silently
Bobby finally stops spraying, satisfied he has killed the imaginary spiders
He looks up at Jimmy and Danny, his eyes swimming with stupid, drug- addled confusion
(cont'd) Who the fuck are you
It's me
Jimmy Bobby squints
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy
Rhymes with Simmy
Yeah
What can  do for you
Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us
Danny and Jimmy notice something simultaneously
There is something under the mattress -
Don't pay her no mind
from under Bobby
She is between the mattress and the box springs
(cont'd) Shut the hell up, goddamit
Bobby starts slapping the top of the mattress with his hand
New from underneath
(cont'd) got no vocation skills
What the fuck you want from me
(keeps slapping) got no vocation skills
Hey man, take it easy
Bobby immediately stops
Looks at Jimmy with incredulity
What
Come on
Ease off the girl
Bobby springs from the bed, grabbing something as he rises
Danny and Jimmy suddenly staring at a  which is loaded with two stainless steel spears
Bobby stands there alternately pointing the speargun at Jimmy, then Danny
Did you bring the plastic men
Bobby nods towards something behind Danny
Danny and Jimmy don't move or speak
(cont'd) Did you bring the plastic men
(beat) Did you bring the plastic men
Bobby rubs his nose
Did
you
bring
the
plastic
men
Nah, we didn't bring 'em
That's just your good crank talking, brother
Bobby tilts his head
(cont'd) We were hoping to catch a few ourselves if you'll hook us up
(calmer) You bring the plastic men
Like  said
Fuck man
Come on, Bobby
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby
Rhymes with
(he draws a blank) Hobby
Bobby twists a smile, revealing speed-blackened teeth
That's a good man
like that
(calmly) Hey, Bobby, look
What you got going with your old lay, it's none of our business
We're just a couple of dope fiends trying to score
Bobby lowers his speargun
Two eight balls
Jimmy breaths a sigh of relief
- Danny and Jimmy exit the room, closing the door behind them
Danny looks at Jimmy
Nice dealer you got there, Jimmy
Oh
that
Ah, he was just juiced
He wouldn't have did nothin' ,
Two spears plunge through the cheap door, stopping inches from Danny's head
They run like hell
- The sun plunges down
The sky turns black
The moon races up and down
The sky lightens
The sun races up and down
Night comes again
- Everyone crashing
Jonestown, post Kool-Aid
It looks like they have all simultaneously fallen asleep where they were standing or sitting
Danny stirs awake
Looks around
He stretches the beer  to the floor staring intently at the spilling liquid
The beer pools up on the floor
Danny transfixed by the image
The last few drops of beer  splashing down
- Danny on the phone
number 678-43K-107 (beat) Tanner and Garcetti He hangs up
- Danny waiting in the shadows
car, sans headlights, pulls into the alley and stops
Danny emerges from the shadows, opens the back door and lays on the back seat
- Two guys in suits in the front,  and
Tanner
blue eyes and  , an air of ex-military around him
Garcetti: swarthly and serious, a   -
(lying on the back seat) 've got a hot one
You go, boy
If it's all the same to you, 'd rather not dish right here in the middle of Crankville
Tanner drives out of the alley
Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we
Well, you know what they say, just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean everyone's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat
- Danny, Tanner and Garcetti outside the car in a deserted park
Danny pacing
You got a name
Bobby, rhymes with hobby
What
Never mind
Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts
'
No last name
It was all pretty informal
Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries
Garcetti produces something from the front seat of the car and trudges over
This the guy
It speaks
The humorless Garcetti hands Danny a " "
Bobby's mug shot glaring
That's him
He's a lot prettier in person though
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne
Dude is bugging
Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards
What's he holding
-
- Bobby's hand extracting the eightballs from a nylon bag full of meth
(
) Couple of eightballs, maybe more
of an open drawer
can be glimpsed inside
(cont'd) Cheap ass techno knockoff in the drawer with extra mags
of the closet
shotgun butt visable (cont'd) 12 gauge in the closet

) Any company
The '  protruding from underneath the mattress
(
) Alas, the lovely Mrs
Bobby was playing the bologna in a Posturpedic sandwich (beat) And there was a kid
visible through a crack in the
(
) kid
Are you sure
-   and    on top of the dresser
- Back on Danny
Yeah
Pretty sure
(beat) Oh yeah
he had a spear gun, too
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker
Somebody has to help you lazy bastards
Garcetti looks at Danny with contempt
They head back to the car
(cont'd) Hey Tanner
you be careful, okay
Danny, 'm touched
Don't be
'm worried about the kid
Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there
Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts
Garcetti throws Danny up against the car
Nose-to-nose
'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch
You're a bottom feader, Flynne
Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect
Garcetti lets Danny go
Stomps off
You're welcome
- , including a  , watching from the parking lot
'  screaming at the top of her lungs as she tries to get a Bobby's sheet-covered body
packing up nearby
One of them suddenly does a graceful little Tai-Chi gesture
clutches at the screaming woman's legs
, amongst the onlookers
His expression gives nothing away
ribbon of blood snakes from Bobby's body, over the parking lot curb and runs into a storm drain
As the blood  to the bottom, mixing with a pool of filthy water

The place cries out "
" Danny exist the stairwell and approaches his door
'  struggles with her groceries
When she goes to open the door, one of the  bags breaks, spilling its contents onto the floor
Danny walks over
(approaching) Let me help you with those
She scoops up the groceries and hurries into her room
Slamming the door behind her
(cont'd) (loud through the door) And to think Miss Manner was living down the hall from me and didn't even know it
There is a can on the floor
Danny bends down to pick it up
(cont'd) Hey, you left a can of
He looks at the can
- The label is in
(cont'd) some Chinese looking shit out here
No reaction
(cont'd) 'll just leave it by the door here
(beat) 'm going now
After a moment, the door swings open
Danny is holding the can out with a big smile on  his face
(cont'd) You really oughta be more careful
This is not a good neighborhood
The woman smiles
pretty smile
Sad too
was rude
'm sorry
'm kinda new around here
You did the right thing
(handing the can over) What is this stuff anyway
Fermented soybean curd
Yummy
She smiles again
World-weary
Sweet
Those eyes
Sad
Sexy
Sad and sexy
(cont'd) My name is Danny Flynne
(off her silence) And you are
Colette Aragon
Thank you, Danny
She closes the door abruptly
- The burning room from the opening scene
Danny's dirty clothes on the bed
He emerges from the shower, a towel wrapped around his waist
There is a  -  on Danny's shoulder
He walks over to the closet, takes a   from the top shelf and puts it on the bed
Pulls a key from his pocket and unlocks the box
He sits there staring at the contents for a moment, then gingerly takes them out
white dress shirt, black slacks and wingtips
- Danny dresses in his clothes, combing his hair
He goes back in the lock box and pulls something else out
He walks over to the cheap vanity and sits down in front of the mirror and stars for a very long time
My name is Tom Van Allen (beat) play the trumpet
He slowly opens the trumpet case revealing a   inside
Runs his fingers along the length of it and up to
taped to the inside of the lid
self- conscious smile on her face like she's uncomfortable with having her picture taken

He takes the trumpet from the case -   from a and a '  with Danny's picture and the name (cont'd) My name is Tom Van Allen and  play the trumpet
He starts to play
"Saeta" again
appears on -    in the middle of the -  () Danny and      sitting on the shore
Watching the sunset
She is his wife,
Danny playing "" on his trumpet
Danny and Liz are alone, except for the myriad birds, silhouetted by the falling sun
gust of wind rushes across the lake, blowing Liz's hair all around her face
dying fish on the waterline, gills pumping for oxygen
Danny finishes playing
Silence
:
That's so
(not finishing the word) / Melancholy
Yes, it hurts my heart
What a beautiful composition
/ And the performance
(goofing) virtuoso rendition is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece
/ Thank you
Thank you very much
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it
/ Again,  thank you
was talking about Miles
Danny playfully tackles her to the ground
/ You, madam, are a heartless wench
And you've got wiener breath
/ Really
It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch
Danny starts kissing her over and over again
(laughing) Tom
Gross
She finally pushes him off
He rolls off of her and snuggles up next to her, spooning her in the sand
/ You know how  make that song melancholy when  play it
think of what my life would be like without you
Liz smiles, snuggles closer to Danny
Tom, let's spend the night here
/ There's no motels around here
No
Right here on the beach
Come on
Let's do it
- Danny sitting at the vanity holding the trumpet (at the vanity, whispering) Okay, we'll stay
We'll stay
/ (on the beach) Come on, Liz
We'll get eaten alive
(at the vanity, softly) No
We'll stay
as Danny and Liz walk away from the shore
The sun sinks completely below the horizon
long fish hawk floats on the last of the thermals
The dying fish breaths its last
Danny (at the vanity) closes his eyes
The trumpet goes back in the case
The lid is closed
The case goes back in the box
The neatly folded clothes are laid on top
The box goes back to the shelf
The light in the closet is turned off
- Danny and Tanner sitting across from one another at a picnic table
Tanner writing serial numbers down as he counts out Danny watching silently
Tanner puts the bills in an envelope, licks the flap, seals it and slides it over to Danny, who doesn't touch it
The envelope lays there between them for the following conversation
You think 'm a Judas
Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord
Garcetti thinks 'm a pile of shit
Garcetti thinks everything is shit
He doesn't even like dolphins
Danny smiles
(cont'd) 'm serious
He hates 'em
You ever hear of anyone who didn't like dolphins
Tanner shakes his head and smiles
Thanks for not judging me
It's not my place
Don't you wonder why  do it
The money
The drugs
Keeping yourself out of jail
know the drill
You don't find that repugnant
Just the way the world works
Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy
You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as  know
Tell that to Bobby
and his wife and kid
Bobby laid his own tracks
He could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end
And as far as 'm concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him
(beat) Now take the money
Danny stuffs the money into his jacket
(cont'd) One think  do want to know is how the hell did you get yourself into this position to start with
You seem like a smart enough guy
It's a long story
Maybe 'll tell you all about it some day
Garcetti emerges from the men's room, zipping up
(cont'd) Hey, Garcetti
You ever get confused and try to flush yourself
Garcetti (all business) You tell him
was getting to it
(to Tanner) Tell me what
'll tell him
(worried) Tell me what
Garcetti sits down next to Danny
Sighs
(mock concern) Danny, it's really pains me to have to tell you this, but do you remember , that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months back
Yeah
What about him
Turns out he's connected
To who
The Mexicali Boys And what does this have to do with me
Garcetti puts his hand on Danny's shoulder, really playing it up
He knows somebody ratted him
What
And he's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a Colombian necktie on whoever it was
Garcetti leans in close (cont'd) You know that thing where they slit your throat and pull your tongue out of the hole
Danny knocks Garcetti's hand away and stands up
Garcetti stalks him
(cont'd) Apparently they call it a necktie because it hangs down about yay long and looks very similar to a tie
Isn't that weird, Danny
Isn't that weird
Shut up, Garcetti
Danny turns to Tanner If he finds out it's me, 'm a dead man
Danny, he isn't gonna find out it's you
Domingo was a slinger, he must have sold to hundreds of different people
Danny paces back and forth
(cont'd) And if you're that worried about it, maybe you ought to get out of town
How the hell am  gonna do that
You guys are still stringing me a long on that possession charge
(mock surprise) You mean that hasn't been cleared up yet
Garcetti chuckles at Danny's fear Fuck you, Garcetti
been at this for almost a year
've done everything you guys have asked of me
Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time
Look, we'll talk to the
When
Soon
promise
We'll get the charges dropped and you can disappear
In the mean time, trust me, he has no idea that you ratted him out
- Danny sitting cross-legged in front of a gravestone
slowly winds its way up the access road towards Danny
Danny stands up
Dusts his pants off
The truck stops nearby
The strains of   from inside
Danny approaches
The passenger's side window rolls down revealing
-   behind the wheel
He wears a cowboy hat and a rodeo belt
He looks like the Chinese Marlboro man
This is
An  painting on the door panel - a bad likeness of Bubba astride a horse, dressed as a cowboy with a huge-breasted Pamela Anderson-type on the saddle behind him
(checking out the painting) Ride 'em cowboy) (southern twang) You like that
Who wouldn't
First rate, ain't it
It's downright classy is what it is
Bubba fires up a cigarette, revealing a pock-marked face
He carries a gun in a tooled leather shoulder holster
(cont'd) You consider my presentation
Get in, hoss
We'll talk it over
Danny climbs in
The window goes back up
As the care pulls away, we back over to the gravestone
The stone reads: "
" - non-descript
cinder block bar
No windows
No frills
- Danny sitting at the bar, nursing a drink
He looks nervous, eyes darting around for potential assassins
He has nothing to worry about with this crowd, harmless alcoholics all
Jimmy The Finn enters and approaches Danny
Danny signals for Jimmy to go to the back, then gets up and follows him, carrying two beers
Jimmy, you don't look so hot
Jimmy has dark circles under his eyes
'm hurting
You on a roll
Was
'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man
You got anything for me
Sorry
Why does it have to feel so bad
You're brain is in reverse mode
cutting off your supply of dopamine
Here
Have a beer
Jimmy sighs, scratches his arms
They are all scabbed up
(cont'd) You see the crank bugs
Oh yeah
(guzzles some beer) Man, Danny, how do you keep your shit together so tight
Danny chuckles
That's a good one
'm serious, dude
You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'
guess there's just no substitute for good genes
Jimmy finishes his beer
Danny signals to the cocktail waitress for more beer
(cont'd) You hear about Bobby
Yeah, it's a pity
Truly a pity
Danny smiles at Jimmy's choice of words
(cont'd) He was a good supplier
(gets an idea) You think maybe there's any drugs left in his room
You know, like hidden
kind of doubt it, Jimmy
The beers arrive
Jimmy lays into his, downing it in one long gulp
Danny slides his over
So, why'd you want to see me
Business
need to leave town and find myself in dire need of some cash
See that
That's just what 'm talking about
What
You
You're smooth
You use words like dire and shit
You got language skills, man
Don't get carried away
find myself in dire need of some cash
Jimmy shakes his head in wonder
You remember that guy you told me about
said he could handle a big hook-up
Yeah, Pooh-Bear
Dude is a big-time cook
'm talking dire
know a buyer
Guy's looking for a quarter's worth
Jimmy frowns
quarter
Danny that ain't even worth
quarter of a million, Jimmy
Jimmy's a drug-addled eyes catch a glimmer
Fuuuuuck Can your man handle that
think so
mean, we'd have to talk to him
Can you set that up
Sure
Jimmy sucks what's left of his beer down
(cont'd) What's in it for us
'm getting a 10% finder's fee from my man if  can get the right price
10%
That's
Jimmy becomes paralyzed by the math
25 grand
You introduce me to your boy, 'll cut you five grand out of my take
That's all you gotta do, just get me in the door

Sparse traffic on the street

(sees Danny eyeballing him) You mad dogging me, Bitch
Heavens no
was just admiring your boots
The dude looks down at this beat-up motorcycle boots
Did you purchase them locally
The dude ignores Danny and keeps pounding on the door
(cont'd) Goodbye now
Nice meeting you
- Danny enters
between the dude and Colette
The sounds of a struggle
Colette screams
The dude yelling at the top of his lungs
Colette sobbing
The dude talking in hushed tones, contrite
- spray painted rusty Chevy Vega belching black smoke
All of the lights are broken
- Jimmy driving
Danny in the passenger's seat, looking down at
the floorboard, or lack thereof
It is completely rusted out
The freeway rushes by underneath
You know, Jimmy, you might as well put a sign on the back of this thing asking the cops to pull you over
You mean, like to throw 'em off
Yeah, that's what  mean
(beat) Where the hell does this guy live anyway
Palmdale Why do they call him Pooh-Bear
think on account of his nose
You're going to have to explain that one
He doesn't have one
You're going to have to give me a little more than that, Jimmy
Well, you know how Winnie the Pooh always got his nose stuck in the honey jar
Well, Pooh-Bear snorted so much crank, they had to cut his nose off
He's got a plastic one though
Danny wonders what he's getting himself into
(cont'd) You know, they say he hasn't slept in over a year
You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep
No (beat) You think she's a tweaker
-'  - sprawling old ranch house tucked into the remote hills of the desert
passes out in the front yard
sniffs at him, then starts pissing on him
He never moves
near the driveway
- - he does indeed have a prosthetic nose
It almost blends in with his face but not quite, making it that much more disconcerting
He takes a huge hit of crystal meth from a pipe, holds it, then blows a long exhale
- Okay, here we go gentlemen
trundles out of the garage and along the driveway
Inside the car,  , their bodies wrapped in tape
Pooh-Bear working the remote control device
- (cont'd) Zapruder
filming the whole thing with a super-8 camera
8 : the pigeons continue along, their stupid eyes glazed with confusion
Ready
- Oswald
sighting a scoped pellet gun
Roger that
- Grassy knoll
aiming a pellet gun further down and to the right of "Oswald"
Ready - Third shooter
is also armed with a pellet gun It's a go
Pooh-Bear watches anxiously
- President Kennedy waving to the crowd, his lovely wife looking radiant beside him as they turn into Dealey Plaza
: the car making a turn, the pigeons oblivious
- (cont'd) Stand by, gentlemen
Stand by
(beat, eyes widening) Steady
steady
The three men open up simultaneously
: a mass of feathers flying as the pigeons are hit
Pooh-Bear pumps his fist
- (cont'd) Yes
Yes
(beat) Out
That's a wrap
Good job, boys
Good job
The car continues rolling past the feet of
Danny and Jimmy, who have been watching the whole thing from the periphery - (cont'd) (to Danny and Jimmy) So
What do you think
/ (ad-libbing) - Cool
- Yeah
Interesting
Pooh-Bear takes the camera from "Zapruder"
- (holding up the camera) 'm gonna get this developed and send it to the Warren Commission
Um,  think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while
- No shit
(thinking) Fuck it
'll send it to Oliver Stone then
He'll get them to reopen the bastard
(
) Pooh-Bear
We got a problem
Oswald is standing over the car, prodding one of the pigeons with his pellet gun
(cont'd) 's still alive
(beat) Should  finish him off
-  - Pooh-Bear and Danny alone in the kitchen
- So, Danny, Jimmy tells me you have a proposition for me
Pooh-Bear picks at a plate of   on his lap
Yeah,  uh, have a buyer who's looking for about a quarter's worth
- Crank or glass
The good stuff
Can you handle that
Pooh-Bear chews his food and nods
- 'm sorry
Would you like a taste
No, 'm good
- insist
It's delicious
Just a taste
Not wanting to offend him, Danny concedes
Pooh-Bear shovels some eggs into Danny's mouth
Not bad
- Secret recipe
Pooh-Bear winks and shovels some more down
Can we talk price
- Make me an offer
don't know, 14,000 a kilo
- deal in
pounds, friend
None of that faggot metric crap for me
Okay
How about um
6,000 a ounce
- (enthusiastic) Hey, okay
Danny looks surprised
It was too easy
You're serious
- Anything for a dear friend
But  just met you
- But you're a friend of Jimmy's think of you as a brother already
Pooh-Bear takes another bite of eggs
So that's 40 lbs
at 6 a pound then
- If you say so
Pooh-Bear,  don't mean to be rude, but  get the feeling you aren't taking me seriously
Pooh-Bear puts the plate down
- Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously
Why do you say that
- welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman
Hey,  was just trying to
- (never losing his smile) want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal
Hey,  don't play that
- 'm sure you don't
At least 'm sure you think you don't
Anyway, want to tell you
It's a good story, guaranteed to break the ice at a party
Pooh-Bear leans back, grinning broadly - (cont'd) Dude shorted me eleven dollar
thought  wouldn't count it till got home
Wrong
(beat) You know what  did
(beat) clamped his head in a vice
:   - - of Pooh-Bear staring down at something , a menacing look on his face
- (
) You should have heard him howling
: Pooh-Bear lights a cigarette - Then  took a Saws All and  cut His skull open :
Pooh-Bear reaching for something
- (
) (calmly) You know, those Saws All really do cut through everything
: Danny getting nervous
Look, you don't have to
- (cont'd) So 'm standing there looking at this dude's brain and 'm thinking to myself, you know, this guy doesn't really need this thing
mean, anyone stupid enough to jam me up doesn't really use their brain to begin with
You know what 'm saying
(beat, dead serious) So  took it
Pooh-Bear makes a   as he illustrates with his hands
: Pooh-Bear looking down at  in his hand, his face blossoming into a sick smile
: Danny listens somberly
- (cont'd) Hell,  make better use out of it than he ever did
Got it up in my freezer
take it out from time-to- time, mix a little of it up in my dinner
(looks at the plate of eggs) of breakfast
- little chunks of gray matter mixed in with the eggs
Pooh-Bear smiles knowingly
Danny turns pale
- 10,000 a pound Danny decides to nerve it out Now you're insulting me
Nice talking business with you
Danny gets up to leave
One of his hands shaking uncontrollably
He steadies it with the other hand
- 9,000
Take it or leave it
Danny stops
'll leave it
Eight is as high as 'll go
See ya'
Danny goes to leave again
- All right, all right
Don't get your knickers in a knot
can live with eight
Pooh-Bear stands up
- (cont'd) You got a deal
They shake hands
- God damn, Danny, you got some nerve
Pooh-Bear respects that
(beat) Oh, by the way
Pooh-Bear takes something from the kitchen counter and tosses it on the table
a store-bought package of
:  that Pooh-Bear has been standing at the meat section in a
He is looking down at the package of in his hand
- (in the grocery store) Hmm
Good price
Pooh-Bear tosses the package in his cart and walks away, whistling
: - (cont'd) You want to stay for lunch
Danny has been had
Pooh-Bear laughs uproariously
- Danny slouched in the passenger's seat
Jimmy holds out a bullet dispenser of crank
You want a hit
No
'm good
Jimmy pockets the drugs
Can  ask you something
Sure, Jimmy
What does
stand for
John Fitzgerald Kennedy
Was he the president
Yes, Jimmy Jimmy drives for a while, then
Danny
Yes, Jimmy
Thanks for not laughing at me
- in a wheelchair crooning a Muzak-like version of Lou Reed's      on a cheapo Karaoke set-up in the back of the bar
(softly, a la Perry Como) Sugar Plum Fairy never once gave it away
Everybody had to pay and pay
Danny, Jimmy, Kujo and Creeper sitting in a booth
Jimmy and Creeper are amped, jaws grinding, eyes bugging
Kujo rambles on but Danny isn't listening
He looks exhausted, his face is pinched, there are bags under his eyes
He scans the bar, stopping on
Colette Colette sees Danny looking
Smiles at him
Danny returns the smile until the trashy dude looks over
Danny looks away
Danny, listen up
Here's the deal
my wife's pimp knows a guy who works at Cedars Sinai medical lab
They're getting a very special delivery a week from this Friday
What is it, drugs
Better than drugs
Kujo leans in and lowers his voice Bob Hope's stool specimen (beat) We're gonna boost it
Why in God's name would we want to do that
So we can sell it
To who
don't know
collector
Fuck Danny, it's Bob Hope
He is a national treasure
Danny shakes his head in amazement, then looks back at Colette again
She sneaks another look at him
- Kujo slides a drink glass in front of him
Check it out
This is the lab
-  ( ) stark hospital hallway
placard on one of the doors -
- "'  " - Creeper points at the glass
What is that
It's the lab
mean what kind of drink
Cuba Libre What is that
Rum and coke
Don't worry about it
just want to be straight on the details
Can  taste it
No, you can't taste it
It's the fucking lab
Now shut up
Danny amused by the conversation
He sees something out of the corner of his eye
The boyfriend kissing Colette roughly
She obviously isn't enjoying it
Danny watching intently
(cont'd) Danny, come on
If 'm gonna let you in on the opportunity of a lifetime, the least you can do is pay attention
Danny turns back to the table
Kujo slides another glass over
(cont'd) This is the courier You should use something smaller
He's the same size as the office
It doesn't ring true
Kujo rolls his eyes
He uses a peanut instead
(
) And the colored girls sing doot-de-doot
-  ( ) courier exits from the elevator carrying a medical sample case
(
) He delivers at four o'clock on the nose every Friday
Alpha team will be in the elevator with the courier
That'll be Danny and Creeper
- Creeper standing in the corner alone, asleep on his feet, drool trickling down his mouth
(cont'd) Every member of the team will be equipped with night vision goggles, a police scanner and two-way radios
The elevator door closes on the dosing Creeper
- He slides over two peanuts behind the courier peanut
(cont'd) number two team, which will be me and Jimmy, will be positioned in the stairwell at the other end of the hall
Kujo slides over two more peanuts
The trashy dude heads into the bathroom
Danny sneaks another look at Colette
This time, she gives him a big smile
-  ( ) Kujo emerges from the stairwell, also alone, approaching the courier
He is wearing shorts, a tank top and after-ski boots
He has a big powdery crank donut around his nostrils
(cont'd) With alpha team following from the elevator, number two team will approach from the stairwell, cutting the courier off before he reaches the lab
Creeper still fast asleep inside the elevator
He wakes with a start, breaking down into a karate stance
- The courier peanut is now surrounded by the other peanuts and the cashew
(cont'd) Facing superior numbers and an array of high-tech weapons, the courier will have no choice but to comply with our demands
-  ( ) Kujo and the courier playing tug-of-war with the case
Kujo points a dustbuster vacuum at the courier like it was a gun
- Jimmy listening intently, takes some of the peanuts
Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team
thought you were done
Jimmy pulls peanut paste from his mouth and mounds them up on the table
said hey sugar, take a walk on the wild side
(cont'd) Now here's the beautiful part
The getaway
Both teams will rappel right down the center of the stairwell, change clothes and walk right out the front door like nothing happened
-  ( ) Kujo tumbling head-over-heals down the metal steps
He gets to his feet, a bloody mess
The kit has sprung open, sending shit samples everywhere
Kujo quickly scrapes as much as he can back into a container and runs off
-  ( ) Kujo bolts out the front door, into the street and directly into the path of
an  , which drags him underneath for a good fifty feet
- Danny watches as the trashy dude exits the bathroom
So what's it gonna be, Danny boy
You in or out
Trashy dude goes to Colette
It looks like he wants to leave and she doesn't
(cont'd) Danny
Trashy dude grabs her by the back of the neck, lifts her off the stool and pushes her out the front door
(watching Colette) 'm afraid 'm gonna have to pass on this one, boys
Danny watches her exit
-  () Danny approaches his door
Stops
Colette is sitting in the hall, head in hands, sobbing
Danny starts to say something
Stops
Goes to this door
Stops again
You okay
She nods
(cont'd) Well
good night then
Danny starts to enter again
Stops again
(cont'd) Why are you out here
Quincey, my boyfriend
he kicked me out
Danny isn't quite sure what to do
He takes a half-step towards her
Look
'd like to help you out
but really don't want to get involved
understand
Thanks anyway
She looks up
That face
Those eyes
Everything about her says "Get involved
" - Danny and Colette in a near-deserted retro coffee shop
mull behind the counter
Colette's mascara is running
Danny hands her a napkin
Thanks
She dabs at her eyes
(cont'd) 'm so embarrassed
Don't be
She looks at herself in a compact mirror
Jesus,  look like a raccoon
was thinking Alice Cooper
She puts her head in her hands
Sighs
Oh God
Come on, cheer up
It could be worse
She looks up
How
don't know
you could be staking your financial future on stealing Bob Hope's stool specimen
She laughs (cont'd) See
No matter how bad things are, there's always someone a little worse off
What about the guy on the very bottom
Leave me out of this
That bad, huh
Danny holds up his water glass
Nevertheless,  still try to see the glass as half-full
He takes a sip
(cont'd) Problem is, it's usually half-full of something that tastes a  lot like urine
He pulls a face
Sets the glass down
Could be worse
(beat) Oh sorry, forgot who  was talking to
Ouch
Colette sips her coffee
Danny looks around nervously
(cont'd) Hey, did  mention that  was a coward
Colette frowns, not sure what he means
(cont'd) Quincey
You sure he isn't gonna come looking for you
Don't worry, he's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now
This man sounds like a real catch
Oh, he's a keeper all right
Colette
He stops
What
Nothing
Go ahead
Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy
It's not that easy
Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt
Who the fuck are you, Dr
Joyce Brothers
(beat) hate the son-of-a-bitch
Then leave
can't
Why not
You don't understand
There's nothing to understand
The guy is a pig
can't leave
You get off on abuse or something
Fuck you
Then why don't you leave
(beat) Just give me one good reason
Because he'll kill me
The waitress and cook look up
(cont'd) Is that simple enough for you
Why don't you call the cops
Why
They don't hold him for more than a day or two
That's long enough to get out of town
can't
've got a kid
She lives with my parents
Quincey knows where they live
Danny chews it over for a second then
Then make sure he gets put away for longer
How
Danny hesitates, not sure of how much he wants to get involved
(cont'd) Tell me how
don't know
(beat) Let me think about it
- Urban blight abounds - The grafitti-filled, cluttered shell of what used to be some sort of offices
sitting on a desk
Danny pacing back and forth in front of him
(Texas drawl) wanna do a small buy first
Ten thousand
We'll see how it goes
Why
The guys is ready to deal now
Because  don't know him and  don't really know you, partner
Now that's down-right insulting
'll have to live with that
My money my risk, my rules
Bubba takes a plastic-wrapped bundle of money from his pocket
Tosses it on the table
- Tanner and Garcetti ensconced in an alley diagonally across the street
Garcetti pointing a -   at the burned out building
He and Tanner wear earpieces, which are attached to the mike
(
) (filtered, broken) guess  don't have a hell of a lot of choice
(
) (filtered) Get used to it
You're in a very tenuous position on the food chain, hoss
Garcetti removes his earpiece and turns to Tanner
You thinking what 'm thinking
Yeah
This could be the one we're looking for
- Bubba exits the building and disappears around the corner
- Danny now alone
He picks up the bundle of cash
Turns to leave when Tanner and Garcetti enter the building
Danny turns and runs the other way
Hold it right there, Flynne
Danny stops
Jesus, you almost gave me a heart attack
Danny secretly pockets the bundle of cash
What the hell are you doing here
Question is, what are you doing here
was trying to score some dope
Cut the shit, Flynne
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here
Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play
Tanner takes out a pair of black leather gloves
(serious) What did  do
Tanner approaches him
Danny backs into a corner
(cont'd) This is a joke, right
You put him up to this, Garcetti
Garcetti is mum
Tanner raises his fists
Danny covers his face
(cont'd) Come on Tanner
don't
Tanner starts swinging but
The punches have absolutely no effect
Danny can't help it
Tanner throws some more creampuffs
Garcetti shakes his head with shame
(shrieking, failing) You think this is funny motherfucker
(still laughing and covering up) can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl
This makes Tanner even madder
His punches become wilder and even less effective
Garcetti, do something
Garcetti tires of the whole show
He pulls a small   from his pocket, switches it on and sticks Danny behind the neck with it
Danny crumples to the floor
Tanner kicks him in the face
Garecetti squats down next to Danny
We know what's going on
(in pain) still don't know what you're talking about
Garcetti jams the stun-gun into Danny's crotch
Garcetti lays off
Danny lays there whimpering
Okay, let me help you
You're setting up a deal with a Chinese redneck
Quarter of a million
Garcetti holds up a tap
(cont'd) We just listened to the whole thing
Danny gaped-mouthed
He can't believe it
(cont'd) Somebody tipped up, dipshit
Jimmy
Who the hell is Jimmy
He's the only one  told
And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one
You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne
Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news
-  () Danny sitting on a crate
He is sporting a   from where Tanner kicked him
Garcetti at the desk dusting the plastic wrapper on the bundle of cash for prints
Tanner paces back and forth in front of Danny
met the guy at a party
He said he wanted to do a biggie
He's new in town so  offered my services
This chink have a name
Bubba
Tanner rolls his eyes
(cont'd) swear
That's all he gave me
Hell,  didn't give him my real name either (off their skeptical looks) He figured the less we know about each other, the better
You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne
After that ass-whipping you gave me
Garcetti suppresses a smile
(finishing up with the bundle) What's on the other end of this thing
Now that  can help you with
Nasty boy
goes by the name of Pooh-Bear
He's a chef
Check with Palmdale
'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne
Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips
What're your taking down
Standard vig
Minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory
Tanner looks at Danny quizzically
Did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off
Look man,  just wanted to make some dough and disappear
didn't want to wait around for Domingo to figure out who doubled back on him
Danny holds his hands up (cont'd) But now 've seen the error of my ways
'll just walk away
call the whole deal off
Wrong
He tosses the bundle of cash to Danny
You mean you want me to roll on these guys
Their silence is answer enough
(cont'd) No
No way
These guys catch a whiff and 'm a fucking bag of Bandini
You've got no choice
Whata you mean 've got no choice
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande
For that old possession charge
Gimme a break
No
You just handed us a new one
We can go Federal on your ass right now: ongoing criminal conspiracy
Intent to buy and distribute $250,000 worth of crank
What's the mandatory on that, Al
Dime, minimum
and over to a wall mounted heating vent , then
in another room
lurking in the shadows
Listening to the conversation through the wall vent in the other room
(
) And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat
(
) That's not good in prison
It's just not good
Bubba listens intently
- Danny hunkered down in the back sea
Garcetti sniffing the air
What's that smell
That would be me
What'd you do, piss your pants
Hell, yes
What the hell do you expect zapping Mr
Johnson with that crackler
Garcetti looks back at Danny with a twisted smile
Who'd have thought it
Danny "Chickenshit" Flynne trying to go large right under our noses
Lay off, Garcetti
'm not in the mood
No
You've got me all wrong mean, in you own pussified way, you actually got some nuts in your little sack
Bullshit
He's a liar
News-flash, Tanner
'm a fucking rat
You think you're so god damned smart, don't you
The dynamic has suddenly changed in the trio's relationship
Tanner is now the bad cop
(cont'd) Well, you played the wrong mark this time, asshole
- Danny approaching the building, we hear shots
from earlier, prowling the streets
Danny ducks into a liquor store and watches from the window
The red car cruises slowly past
Danny squinting, trying to make out
street light illuminates the tag momentarily
:
Danny frowns, not sure that to make of it
'  - Colette and Quincey lying in bed
of Danny's trumpet wafting in the air
Quincey is fast asleep
Colette lays there, eyes open, listening to the coolly hypnotic strains of Miles Davis' "Generique
" - Danny in his good clothes, sitting in front of the mirror, playing his trumpet, staring at the photos of his wife
'  - Colette now sitting on the floor of the adjoining wall with her arms around her knees
She closes her eyes and leans her head against the wall, soaking in the music
- Danny continues playing
He sneaks down a look at
on the vanity in front of him
The word, "" printed on the front
appears on the wall behind him again
from Danny to the image as we
: -    () The car jolting slowly back and forth over the bumpy road
- Danny driving
Liz in the passenger seat looking pissed
The Salton Sea can be seen far below in the distance shimmering under a full moon
,
Why didn't you just ask for directions back there
/ Come on, where's your pioneer spirit
You mean like the Donner Party
/ Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to
And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious
Tom, quit fucking around
/ Okay, okay
(peering through the windshield) There's a house up there
'll go ask for directions
- dilapidated house further up in the hills, lights glowing
- Liz sees the run-down old house
You think that's a good idea
/ What do you mean
Look at that place
It's creepy
Danny steers the car onto the narrow dirt approach to the house
/ First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't
Which is it
wanted you to ask back there
You know, before you got us lost
/ Just no pleasing you, is there
Just admit you're wrong
/ We all know how much you like hearing that
Okay, Liz,  was wrong
There
You happy
Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom
It gets old
/ No
You know what gets old
Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up
Here it comes, poor Tom
/ But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills
'm just an unemployed musician
You have every right
That is so unfair
Danny stares straight ahead, steering the car towards the house
/ My sentiments exactly
Why are you doing this
Danny doesn't answer
(cont'd) never once asked you to stop playing
wouldn't dream of it
So don't take your low self-esteem out on me
Danny continues to ignore her
Tom
screw it
Tell me when you're ready to apologize
- lying on the bed, reliving the moment (on the bed, whispering) 'm sorry, Liz
love you and 'm sorry
But the     never answers
- It is raining buckets outside
Danny sleeping soundly
The roof of Danny's room is leaking, Danny's eyes pop open
He lays there rigidly
- The bar is almost empty
Danny quietly playing chords on a beat-up old upright piano in the back of the room - the through-line of Davis' "All Blues
" (
) This seat taken
Danny looks up
Oh
Hi
What happened to your eye
Turns out 'm allergic to steel-toed boots
Go figure
(beat) By the way, 'm not looking for a matching set
(off her puzzled look) Where's Quincey
Don't worry
He's out of town
How far out of town
Trust me
We're safe
Colette sits down on the piano bench next to Danny
(cont'd) Please keep playing
He continues
She sits there listening for a few moments
(cont'd) That's nice
What is it
Miles Davis
"All Blues
" Never heard of him
Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music
Like you
Nah
'm strictly minor league
except for the fucked-up part
Danny continues to play
Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn
No false notes
Always honest
And you admire that
It's the only way to play
Colette slides closer
Is that how you play
try
No false notes
She pulls even closer
No deep dark secrets
She goes to kiss him
Danny stops playing
Pulls away from her
(cold and abrupt): What are you up to
Nothing
What do you want from me, Colette
don't want anything
Why are you so suspicious
It gets me through the day
You really need to lighten up
She puts her hand on his leg
(cont'd) Just relax
He moves his leg away
Look,  can't help you with Quincey if that's what you're after
This has nothing to do with him
So you're just attracted to me, is that it
Yes
Why do you find that so hard to believe
How much time do you have
What is wrong with you
How much time do you have
You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny
You use 'em like some sort of shield
Who the fuck are you
Dr
Joyce Brothers
There you go again
You're nothing but false notes
You don't like the tune, find another station
What are you hiding, Danny
Therapy session is over
He closes the keyboard cover
You think you're the only one down here with a sad story
No
But 'm the only one with my sad story

Pooh-Bear
Did five years manslaughter for beating a pimp to death with an electric wheelchair
Excuse me
Several possession charges, but nothing major
Why doesn't Palmdale
just raid the guy
They have
But they never found a lab
That's because he doesn't have one
Whata you mean
He told me - Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers
As least that's what the word is
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then
That's probably what he would have done if we hadn't found out about your get-rich-quick scheme
You're lucky, Flynne
Funny,  don't feel lucky
We're coordinating with Palmdale
We'll have your sorry ass covered
What if he caps me before you can make a move
Golly,  hadn't thought of that
Don't we always take good care of you
Danny doesn't look reassured
Speaking of which
you run that license plate for me
You mean the menacing red car
Garcetti and Tanner exchange a smile
What
Is it bad
'm afraid so, Danny
Who is it
Brace yourself
Danny's eyes dart back and forth between Garcetti and Tanner
Come on
Who is it
Domingo's boys
Worse
Much worse

Garcetti and Tanner break out laughing

Nancy Plummer
Danny reacts to the name, not listening to the rest of what Garcetti and Tanner have to say
She's 57 and she's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years
Now that's scary
Danny lost in thought
You're paranoid, Flynne

Jimmy's Vega sputters to a stop in front of Danny
Jimmy gets out and hands Danny the keys

He is preoccupied with something in his hand which he is cleaning with a toothbrush
Pooh-Bear, my man
What's up
Pooh-Bear doesn't respond
Continues brushing
He's blue
Comin' down from a 10 day ride
Danny closes his eyes
Not what he wanted to hear
You want to do this some other time

'm sorry
- Pull your motherfucking pants down
Danny looks to the two Bills for help
(laughing nervously) Come on, guys

Big Bill pulls a 19th century double-barreled   from his jacket and points it at Danny's head
Argh, matie
'm a pirate
- Little Bill Little Bill drops Danny's trousers
Danny about to object when he is started into silence
The saturnine Pooh-Bear raises his head, illuminating his face
He isn't wearing his prosthetic nose He looks like some obscene human bat
Pooh-Bear holds up the plastic nose he has been cleaning, inspecting it under the light
- (cont'd) Introduce him to Captain Steubing
He pops his nose back into place, but it goes on crooked
The Bills escort Danny over to the cage
There is The cage is divided by a large piece of Plexiglas
- (cont'd) You'll have to excuse him, he ain't ate for over a week
The weasel is foaming at the mouth
- (cont'd) That and the rabies
Don't make for a happy weasel
(trying to stay calm) Pooh-Bear
come on, man
What is this
(off Pooh-Bear's silence) It's me, Danny
thought we had a deal
- Big Bill Big Bill pushes Danny up to the cage, which comes up to about waist level
- Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police
What
Pooh-Bear holds up his hand
- Don't address me
didn't make the accusation
Please
don't know what you're
- Uh-uh-uh
He points to the cage
Danny looks down at the weasel, which is trying to gnaw through the Plexiglas
Jesus Christ
(to the weasel) Um
'm not
Captain Steubing
'm not working for the cops
The weasel continues to gnaw
- He don't believe you
Big Bill
Drop your package in the cage
My what
Put your pee-pee through the hole
There is a hole in the top of the cage on the opposite side of the Plexiglas from Captain Steubing
This is fucking crazy
Big Bill pulls back the hammer on the gun
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum
Oh fuck
oh Jesus
Danny's eyes dart quickly over to Little Bill, who like everyone else, is watching the weasel
Little Bill is wearing a big, filthy pea coat with    on the side
Danny still hasn't complied with Pooh-Bear's order
- Shoot him
Okay
Okay
From behind, we see Danny bend slightly, dropping his privates into the cage
(cont'd) (eyeing the wild rodent) Oh my God
oh-my-fucking-God
Danny tries to stay calm, shoots another look at Little Bill who is standing right next to him
- Now get talkin' didn't fucking do anything swear to God
Pooh-Bear leans forward and opens the Plexiglas partition about half an inch
bolts for the opening, gnashing its teeth, trying to squirm through
- You got something to tell Captain Steubing, you'd better do it now
The weasel squirms and squeals and bangs against the Plexiglas
Danny uses the diversion
He quickly   from him own jacket pocket and        '  between the coat and the lining
No one notices
Pooh-Bear opens the Plexiglas even more
The weasel is able to get his head through the hole
He bares his filthy teeth
(rapid-fire) Captain Steubing, listen to me
You're after the wrong guy
This is the fuck you should be talking to
He nods towards Little Bill
Pooh-Bear cocks his head
(cont'd) Jimmy told me that Little Bill's been shorting Pooh-Bear
settin' up his own stuff on the side
That's a pack of discharge
Danny now makes eye contact with Pooh-Bear, who listens intently
It's true
Jimmy saw him flashing a pimp role at a bar the other night
said he was dissin' your ass in front of one of your customers
Pooh-Bear rises slowly
Approaches the triumvirate
Danny keeps one eye on
the weasel as it continues its assault on the opening
- Man'll say a lot of thing when he's sporting weasel food for a pecker
Damn straight
- Least  can do is check it out though
Pooh-Bear pulls a chrome
45 from his waistband
Can  pull my dick out now
Pooh-Bear limply aims the
45 at Little Bill
- (cont'd) Big Bill Big Bill pats Little Bill down
(holding up his arms) Go ahead
got nothing to hide
Big Bill checks all of Little Bill's pockets, coming up empty
The weasel has squeezed about a third of the way through the hole
Can  pull my dick out
Danny, panicked, eyes the hole in the pea coat
He's clean
Danny can't believe it
But when Little Bill lowers his arms, a big roll of cash protrudes from the hole
Pooh-Bear and Big Bill see it immediately
What
He follows their gaze to the cash
- (eyes on Little Bill) Yeah
Danny extracts himself from the cage just as
the weasel bolts through the opening and springs for the hold in the cage

Please
Or 'll kill you
Please, Danny
What the hell was that
Who told you was five-0
- No one
It was just a test
need to be sure of who 'm dealing with from time-to-time
Pooh-Bear nudges the baggie towards Danny
- (cont'd) Take it easy
You passed
Danny hands over the bundle of cash
Pockets the dope
Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel

Nancy and Verne look at one another

Nancy brings in a pot of coffee
Verne eyes Danny silently
Danny won't look him in the eye
All right, Nancy, how'd you track me down
Billy Sutcliffe said he saw you at a bar down in Gardena a few weeks ago
Said you looked so bad, he barely recognized you
Nancy pours the coffee

Said you were a drug addict
Maybe  should just go
Danny pushes away from the table
Nancy grabs Danny's wrist
No
We want to help you, Tom
Danny stays put

know how hard it is to find closure
Closure
How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there
found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter gave my grief to Jesus Christ
Is that what you want me to do
Put it all on Jesus
Let him sort it out in the afterlife
You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom
You can't keep hiding
Maybe  am dealing with it
know it's not my place to pass judgement on you but
Danny looks at the shrine to Liz on top of the piano
Then why don't  see any pictures Of me up there
That was my idea
You never did like me much, did you Verne
(beat) And you can't stand it that  walked out of there alive and Liz didn't
You think 'm a coward, don't you
Verne's silence is answer enough
(cont'd) don't blame you for hating me
At least  understand that
(back to Nancy) But forgiving the butchers who killed Liz well 'm having some trouble with that one
Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, a persecute you
Danny touches Nancy's hand tenderly
'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy
But you can't forgive for Liz
No one can
And you can't forgive for me
Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker
don't buy that
There's a place for hatred

acted like an ass and  never had a chance to apologize to her
Do you know what that feels like
It's not too late to show her you're sorry
How
Verne slams his hand down on the table
By not disgracing her memory
What does that mean
You might as well be spitting on her grave every time you put drugs up your nose
Or did you just conveniently forget that it was drug dealers who killed my daughter
Verne glares at Danny
No forgiveness in his heart
(cont'd) You ever think you might be buying drugs from the very people who took her life
You don't understand

(filtered) Red team
, repairing the motel sign out front
He's heading to his room
The workman watch Danny head into a room at the far end of the facility
As he enters the room
(filtered) Black team
- on the other side of the wall from Danny's room -
enters and sits on the bed, his back to the camera
- They continue down the road, away from the motel
Okay
It's all yours
- Tanner pulls the car in behind a rock formation on the bluff
- Tanner kills the engine
Garcetti checks his watch
Half an hour to kickoff
Tanner takes a pair of    from under the seat
- Trahn pulls into the lot
He emerges from the car with his briefcase, looks around, then heads down to the room
Trahn checks his watch, then
(
) It's open
- Trahn enters
Danny sitting with his back to Trahn
You alone
Danny nods
(cont'd) Any word from Pooh-Bear
Danny shakes his head
(cont'd) You okay, hoss
Trahn walks over to Danny, who sits there with his head down, his face obscured by a baseball cap
Slowly, he looks up
(cont'd) What the hell
Danny told me to tell you that he was sorry
(beat) He said he had to take care of this himself
- Tanner scanning with the night vision glasses
Here he comes
that the car is on a bluff above -'
Danny pulls up in a rental car
'  - Danny's hand is shaking uncontrollably
Easy, boy
He looks at his hand again
It continues to shake
He takes a deep breath
'
As Danny gets out of the car and goes to the trunk
Tanner watching
Where's Bubba
Maybe he isn't showing
Danny takes a gym bag out of the trunk and approaches Pooh-Bear's house
Looks like Flynne's handling the cash
Let's get into position
They get out of the car and trek down the bluff towards the house
-'  - Big Bill lets Danny in, then pats him down for weapons
Satisfied, he leads Danny to the kitchen
- Danny enters and stops
worried look
Pooh-Bear along with
The men eye Danny silently
They look like ex-cons
What the hell is this
- Just some buddies
This is bullshit
You didn't say anything about anybody else being here
- What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead
The other guys snicker, one of them almost spitting his beer out
Danny smiles good-naturedly
Shoots a look over at
one of the guys sitting where he taped his gun earlier
Come on, man, let's deal
He throws the bag on the table, knocking a beer into the guys lap
The guy springs up, pissed off
- Cool it
We got business
Yeah, dickhead
Danny moves over and plops down in the guys seat
- Danny fumbling with the gun, trying to untape it without being too obvious
Pooh-Bear unzips the bag
Inside, a lot of cash
- Oh my, oh my
(beat) Big Bill, come take a look at this
Big Bill is behind Danny, over by the sink
He pulls his  and walks over
Danny continues trying to get the gun loose
Something catches his eye the    is open, casting a reflection of the room behind him
Big Bill approaches Danny, pointing the gun at Danny's head
The other men ease back from the table a little
- Danny still can't get the gun loose
- Big Bill right behind Danny
He raises the flintlock
Danny bugging
He rips at the gun
Too late
Big Bill goes to fire
Using the reflection, Danny ducks at the last instant
Big Bill
The guy across the table takes the mini-ball in the chest
- Danny extricates the gun
Turns on Big Bill, who sees the gun and holds his hands up
Danny  , the bullets blowing through Big Bill's hands and thumping into his chest
Big Bill crumples
When Pooh-Bear goes to pull his gun from his waist-band, it discharges, shooting him in the thigh
The muzzle flash ignites his pants leg
-   , , slapping at the fire on his leg
Danny wheels on the other two guys at the table, who are going for their guns
Danny opens up on them with the Glock, flooring them before they can get a shot off
- still descending the bluff, Tanner and Garcetti hear the gunfire
- Danny turns on Pooh-Bear, who sits there staring at his injured leg
Danny puts the gun to Pooh-Bear's head, closes his eyes and starts to pull the trigger
Pooh-Bear lifts his gun and
Danny collapses
Pooh-Bear gets to his feet
- Oh lordy, oh lordy, oh lordy
Pooh- Bear done shot himself
He's in shock
He grabs the duffle bag from the table and staggers down the hallway, into the living room
- Tanner and Garcetti at the front door, listening
They pull their ski-masks on, take out their guns, then silently enter
- gunsmoke abounds
One of the guys  on the floor
Tanner and Garcetti enter the kitchen, guns drawn and ready
They survey the scene
Bodies everywhere
Big Bill lays there dying, staring with confusion at the stigmata in his hands
Danny lying in a heap, next to Big Bill
Suddenly, they hear -  from somewhere in the house
Tanner signals for Garcetti to take point
They head down the long hallway, slowly and silently
When they are gone
Danny stirs on the floor
His eyes open
He opens his shirt and checks his torso       -
He struggles to a sitting position, in great pain from the impact bruises left by the bullets
He picks up his gun, gets up on wobbly legs and follows Tanner and Garcetti down the hall
as he creeps down the hall
-   - Exiting the bathroom and creeping towards the front room
Anybody there
Danny continues
He stops at the end of the hall
His eyes go wide with fear and revulsion
Liz is still in her hiding place behind the end of the couch
Her head is resting comfortably on the arm of the couch
She looks fine
There is even a slight smile on her lips
(cont'd) Liz
Then he notices it
a widening pool of  seeps from under the couch like some living thing
More blood patters down from some   on the side of her head
Danny staggers towards her
Her eyes flutter slightly
Danny sits next to her
Holds her hand
There is nothing he can do
Liz tries to speak
Can't
'm here, Liz
'm here
She squeezes his hand
Then goes limp
-'  - Danny continues down the hall, remembering
-   -  () Danny sitting there with Liz in a pool of blood
He notices something on the floor
' , the contents spilled on the floor with a teddy bear and the word "" on the front
Danny goes over and picks up the card
- He opens it
"'
"   home pregnancy test taped inside, the reading is
Danny drops the card
Stares down at it as
the blood from the floor pools out and engulfs the card
- On the placid sea as '   resounds from the house in the distance
-'  - standing in the hallway, staring, his face a blank
- - cooking up a huge dose of meth with a lighted hundred dollar bill
He draws the meth into a syringe then turns on the stereo with a remote
Pooh-Bear prepares to dose, looking for a vein in his neck, never noticing
Garcetti's gun moving to the back of Pooh-Bear's head
Pooh-Bear about to plunge the drugs when
Pooh-Bear pitches forward, dead
The syringe falls to the floor
Tanner and Garcetti standing over him
They pull their ski masks off
Get the bag
Garcetti holsters his weapon and picks up the bag of money from the floor
(cont'd) Let's get out of here
Garcetti goes down where he stands
He lays there twitching like a rabbit
Tanner staring down the sucker's end of Danny's gun
Danny
My name is Tom
Tanner frowns
(cont'd) Tom Van Allen Danny raises his gun
Whatever you say, man
Look
can we talk about this
Yeah
Okay
Listen carefully
(beat) You're in the bathroom
You've been shot in the shoulder
Danny shoots Tanner in the shoulder
He collapses to the floor
- his eyes flutter and open
Danny walks over to Tanner and stands above him
(cont'd) there's two guys with masks and guns in the other room about to kill your wife
Tanner looks at Danny, confused
(cont'd) But you know if you go out there, they'll kill you, too
You'll both die
What do you do
Tanner realizes what Danny is talking about
(cont'd) Do you go out there and die like a man or do you live to fight another day
Tanner doesn't answer
Danny (cont'd) What do you do
Still no answer
(cont'd) Answer the question
Tanner is ghost white, loosing blood quickly
Danny (cont'd) What do you do
Please
don't do this
Answer the fucking question
When Danny goes to shoot Tanner again
Tanner pulls a -  from the back of his belt and plunges it into the back of Danny's gun hand
The gun discharges, missing Tanner
Danny drops the gun
Tanner snatches it up
Tanner immediately has the gun inches from Danny's head
Danny freezes Does that answer your question
(beat) fight
fight and  die like a man
(beat) You're a fucking coward, Flynne
You lived like one and now you're gonna die like one
Danny looks up at the gun, his face a blank
(mumbling) Glock semi-automatic 9 mm
'
Tenifer matte finish, Polymer grip, fixed sights, 4 and 1/2 inch barrel, 22 ounces, double action and a
of all the shots Danny fired with the Glock
-  at Big Bill -  at the guys at the table -  at Garcetti -   at Tanner and a   magazine
Still staring at the gun
He knows the gun is empty
He notices something on the floor
(cont'd) Or did  say
Danny trying to remember
(cont'd) Which was it, mister
Was it ten or was it eleven
(beat) Pretty big fucking difference if you ask me
starts chuckling
Looks up at Tanner
It doesn't matter
Danny looks down at the syringe again
Tanner sees it too
Too late to be a hero
Danny picks up the syringe
Tanner pulls the trigger
-   towards the firing pin as it springs forward toward  with a
Ten it is
Danny jams the   '  all the way down to the plunger, dosing him with the meth
Tanner goes down, blood bubbling from his throat around the syringe
His eyes roll back as he  convulses from the drugs
Danny struggles to his feet
Tanner quivers from head to toe like some freaked-out Pentecostal in the throws of a holy possession
Danny pulls the syringe from Tanner's throat Suddenly,
Garcetti standing there pointing his gun at Danny, rocking slightly back and forth, a bullet hole in his cheekbone
He looks brain dead
Danny doesn't move
Garcetti looks like he wants to shoot his gun, but can't
He keeps looking down at his hand, trying to get it to obey
Danny calmly walks over and takes the gun from Garcetti
Garcetti puts his hand to his nose and blows out a clot of blood
He looks down at his hand
He has hacked up the bullet he was shot with
Garcetti smiles an embarrassed smile at Danny
' (softly) You're dead
Garcetti nods slightly
He goes to a kneeling position, then curls up on the floor like he is taking a nap and dies
Danny goes over to the couch and sits down
Danny with his head in his hands, emotionally and physically exhausted
'
Blank
Devoid of anything
He stuffs Garcetti's gun into his own mouth, hand shaking
He takes the gun out
Stuffs it back in again, shoving it way down, almost gagging on it
The barrel clatters against his teeth
He takes it out again Danny starts crying
Lifts the gun halfway again, then drops it
He jumps up
Goes over to the still-wheezing Tanner and empties his clip into him
When the clip is spent, Danny keeps pulling the trigger over and over again
He stands there pulling the trigger again and again and again and again
: - Danny dressed in his "Tom" clothes
He limps over to the bed and picks up the trumpet case
Carries it over to the mirror
Danny staring at his reflection
He lights a cigarette
My name is Tom Van Allen
'm a trumpet player
Danny smiles
(
) Nah, you're Danny Flynne
He turns
and  standing there
Quincey holds a nine millimeter with a muzzle suppressor
You're a motherfucking rat
He shoots Danny in the stomach
Danny slumps to the floor
His cigarette falls out of his mouth and rolls under the bed
Colette freaks
You said you wouldn't kill him
She tries to go to Danny but Quincey stops her
You lied to me
Oops
My bad
Danny looks at them, confused, a blood stain blossoming on his white shirt
Colette, what happened
Didn't the cops
The cops came
But they didn't find nothing
Turns out their
game 'em some bad information
Quincey holds up the baggie of drugs
Danny looks from Quincey to Colette
Colette looks away
(cont'd) You fuck with the Mexicali Boys, this is what you get, homes
- the cigarette smoldering on the carpet
(cont'd) Domingo thought you might be the one who went rat on him
Quincey looks at Colette (cont'd) So  brought in a rat of my own
Danny looks at Colette, dumbfounded
You set me up
Bitch played you like a squeezebox, Romeo
Danny can't help from laughing at the irony
Beads of sweat are forming on his blanched face
He looks at Colette with a wry smile
You're good, princess
'll give you that
Danny, it's not what you think
Danny looks down at his bloody stomach
owed them money
a lot of money
they didn't give me a choice
You know how it works
When got to know you,  tried to back out
that's when they did this
(she indicates the bruises) But  told them  wouldn't do it didn't want to see you get hurt
Danny stares at her, not sure what to believe
He looks over at Quincey
She selling me a bill, home boy
Quincey shakes his head
Nah, she ain't lying
She took a pretty good beating from you, ace seen grown men crack after a lot less
But not this bitch
(beat) It was very touching
Then why are we here
They threatened to kill my daughter
(beat) had no choice
(beat) 'm sorry, Danny
Danny looks at Colette, imagining the awful beating she must have taken
It's okay
It's okay
(Danny touches her face
) (beat) God damn, you're beautiful
-
The fire spreads quickly
Jesus
Quincey grabs her arm
(cont'd) Let's go
No
The drapes go up in flames
Quincey puts the gun to the back of her head
You wanna die here with him or come with me
Colette, go
don't want to leave you
Your daughter needs you
Go
The fire continues to spread
Colette kisses Danny on the lips
Quincey pulls her away
Collette looks back one last time just as the flames reach the door, cutting off any escape
Danny breathing hard
He gets up
Staggers over to the mirror where his trumpet is
He opens the case and takes the trumpet out
He plops down on the bed and
He stops for a second, a smile on his lips
He starts to play
: - Back to the opening scene
The whole room ablaze
Danny lying on the bed, playing the horn
(
) So what is it
Who am  after it's all said and done
Pieces of the roof start falling in
(cont'd) Tom Van Allen or Danny Flynne
(beat) Avenging angel or plain old Judas
He stops playing
(cont'd) (weakly) You decide, friend
You decide
He closes his eyes
(cont'd) 'm too tired
so you decide
He drops his trumpet and lays his head back
: ,    - moving through the flames
'  - seemingly floating through the fiery room
(
) Oh shit
What is this
Emerging from the flames into a dark hallway
Danny's eyes flutter as he seemingly continues to float
(cont'd) Am  dead
linoleum floor rushes underneath
(cont'd) Linoleum
This must be hell
Danny head sags, finds himself staring at
The tattoo smiles and speaks
(warped, distorted) Hang in there buddy
Stairs rush by underneath
Then another hallway
'
- a bright white light at the end of the hall
(cont'd) Oh no
What a fucking cliche
On Danny's face, floating through the hall
His eyes fluttering
the light
Closer
Closer
Danny's eyes close, his head droops
: as his eyes flutter and open
'
- an image slowly coming into focus
staring down at him with concern
Danny blinks his eyes again
Looks up at
working on him
Danny smiles a weak smile at Jimmy
Jimmy just sits there, nodding his head, a big shit-eating grin on his face
The paramedic continues to work on Danny
His eyes slowly close
: - Danny exits a cab and heads towards a coffee shop
He looks like a new man
(
) Well, 've had some time to think about it and it's pretty simple after all
guess it's like the man said - "Man is the measure of all things
" should know
ran the gamut
Avenging Angel, Judas, loving husband, prodigal son, prince of Denmark
was all of those things
(beat) Tom Van Allen got his revenge
Good for Tom
And Danny Flynne
He got gut-shot for being the low-life rat that he was
Sucks for him
(beat) But as far as 'm concerned, they're both dead
Danny looks through the window of the shop
Colette inside, working the counter, pouring coffee
(cont'd) But what about this guy
Who is he
Danny enters the shop
(cont'd) To tell you the truth,  don't know yet
- Danny takes a seat at the counter
Colette turns and sees him
(cont'd) But  like his chances
They stare at one another for a beat, then smile
Colette pours him some coffee
(cont'd) really like his chances
They strike up a conversation as we
