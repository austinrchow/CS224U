: - An exclusive, walled-off section of Hancock Park
There's only one route in and out, past a manned guardhouse on Wilshire
- Colonial-style mansion, surrounded by an imposing, wrought- iron fence
There is a bronze plaque, in English and Korean, next to the entranceway: Consulate of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea The driveway gate opens and a long, black Mercedes with tinted windows and diplomatic license plates glides out
-   - An alert North Korean  watches the perimeter
He pushes a switch to close the gate behind the Mercedes
-   - From atop a pole outside the south wall, a man with binoculars overlooks the private streets of Fremont Place
- as the Mercedes cruises through the quiet neighborhood
The man,  , is thirtyish, nervous; with short, sandy hair
He takes the binoculars away from his face and we see his eyes -- they're a strange, unnaturally light gray
Javal takes an   from an unlabeled prescription bottle and pops it into his mouth
He climbs down the pole to a van with a phone company logo on it
- The Mercedes comes out of the Fremont Place gate, and turns into the heavy morning traffic
- ( ) - It is extremely quiet, due to inch-thick glass on the windows and 4,000 pounds of armor plating on the car's chassis
The  is a North Korean Army Major
On the seat beside him is an -74, a 5
45x39mm-caliber machine gun

(Korean; subtitled) [Just our damn Nanny
] - Javal's van, also with tinted windows, turns onto Crenshaw
It follows the Mercedes, several cars behind it
'  - ( ) - Javal, wired, drums on the steering wheel while driving
He glances at some expertly constructed, radio-control sitting on the seat next to him
- Traffic is moving at about 35
The Mercedes merges onto the freeway, heading west
Javal's van follows
The thumping of a   rattles the other drivers' fillings as a  with its stereo turned up to "11" cruises by
- ( ) - Even 500 watts of bass cannot penetrate the armored silence
The Driver scans the road, wary but sensing no danger
He puts on his blinker to take the 405 South exit
- The van follows, now directly behind the Mercedes, in a procession of vehicles going up the long, curved overpass arcing 100 feet above the 10, toward the 405
'  - ( ) - As they approach the crest of the overpass, Javal flips a switch on his radio-control unit
- Six small , exact replicas of the stay-alert bumps on the white lines of the overpass,
They spew hundreds of sharp, triangular nails across the roadway
Immediately, scores of tires on passing cars
Causing, 50 yards ahead of the Mercedes and van, the most hellacious, gut-wrenching, piss-your-pants, chain-reaction - you can imagine
Dozens of drivers   of their vehicles
sideswipe their neighbors
grind against the guard rails
Some fishtail into 180's, smashing headlong into the traffic still coming onto the overpass
Brakes squeal, people scream, metal crumples, airbags deploy, glass shatters
And then it gets really nasty
Honda gets jammed under a truck hauling cinder blocks
The truck , tipping over like a drunken giant
It  through the concrete wall and guard rail
Along with several cars and their  , swept over the edge by the truck like discarded soda cans
They plummet through space,  onto the freeway below
- ( ) - Sam, Joy, and the Governess brace themselves as the Driver slams on the brakes
He barely avoids hitting anything
(Korean) [Stay in the car
] - nightmare scene of smoke, twisted wrecks, dazed victims
The Mercedes and van sit motionless in the backed-up traffic
/
'  &  - Javal slides open a   on the floor of the van
He slips a wheeled, mechanic's repair platform through it
as, unnoticed amid the chaos, he lies on the platform and rolls under the Mercedes
The undercarriage of the Mercedes is armored with steel
Javal stops at a patch of perforations -- an air exchange vent
He attaches a slim  over the vent, flips a switch on it, then rolls back toward the van
- Oblivious to Javal's actions below them, everyone watches as police and news helicopters circle above
Then, some motorcycles straddle the lanes and zoom by
'  - Sweating, Javal sits back in the driver's seat and checks another radio unit
Working
- The  has cleared a path through the devastation, and traffic trickles through
As the Mercedes and the van pass by, Javal looks proudly at the misery he's wrought
He follows the Mercedes onto the 405 south
'  - ( ) - Javal drives behind the Mercedes, with one hand on the radio unit
The Mercedes signals to take the Venice exit
Javal fingers the radio unit, itching to use it
But he  by the Mercedes as it gets off the freeway
- Javal's device is armed, and waiting
: - '  - pretty street in the Miracle Mile, lined with neat, single- family homes
Timed  systems water some of the yards
Every house on the block except the one we're in front of has a "For Sale" sign on the lawn
From the weathered looks of the signs, they've been there for quite a while
'  -  - It's a hot night
The ceiling fan above the bed spins slowly
tosses restlessly in bed, the sheets half-covering him
Next to him his wife,  , snores contentedly
Carson is in his late thirties, outdoorsy, with a tight, muscular build
Emotionally he's tightly-wound as well
Miranda is 35, raven-haired, sensible, pretty
She believes above all else that one should never raise one's voice
Carson groans
he's
: - (' ) - Quick,  :  street cordoned off with police tape
Cops,  teams,  surround  , a bank
Carson, younger, hair shorter, sits in an across from the bank
Covering the mouthpiece of the phone in his hand, he's arguing with the   in the truck
Suddenly, a huge, fiery  blows out the front of the bank building
Horrified, Carson runs toward it
: '  -    - Carson is snapped awake by a   going off outside
Son of a bitch
He bolts out of bed, wearing nothing but a pair of striped bikini briefs
Miranda rolls over, sleepy, unconcerned
Pete
please
we have to be up early tomorrow
Call the police
Yeah, right
He races down the hall -- right past the house alarm keypad, its  reading "
" He grabs an aluminum baseball bat from the umbrella stand
Forgetting to disarm the house alarm, he yanks the front door open
The house alarm begins
(continuing) Shit
pulls the pillows over her head and sighs
Not again
'  - Carson comes around to the driveway, which is illuminated by the streetlight -- Where two 20-ish  are sitting in his 1965 Mustang convertible, their presence courtesy of a huge cut they've made in the otherwise-perfect ragtop
Car-theft tools in a leather case between them, they're prying the ignition switch out of the dashboard
Asshole #1 spots Carson
He gets out of the car, wielding a crowbar
His partner keeps working
Asshole #1 lunges viciously, swiping at Carson with the crowbar, taking a piece out of his side
Carson starts profusely, but he's too pissed to notice
Carson uses his bat to take the offensive
They go at each other like combatants in a swordfight, the  of metal echoing through the neighborhood along with the screaming house and car , and frantic neighborhood
Surprised at Carson's fury and strength, Asshole #1 backs onto the lawn, oblivious to the running
As he backs away, his shoe catches on one of the sprinkler heads
It breaks off, and a huge  of water sprays out
Carson holds his bat in both hands and jams the front of it into Asshole #1's breadbasket
He doubles over
Carson grabs Asshole #1's arm, and pulls it quickly against his raised knee
There is a  and a loud howl as the arm breaks, and Carson tosses him aside
Seeing this, Asshole #2 gives up on the car
He takes off toward the street
Carson runs to head him off, but he's a lot faster in his Air Jordans than Carson is in his bare feet
Carson grabs the metal lid from a garbage can at the curb and it like a huge Frisbee
It sails across the street -- And  Asshole #2's head
He kisses the pavement, stunned
Carson runs up and grabs him, but he pulls out a long, sharp screwdriver and jabs at Carson with it
Then, blue flashing lights appear from around the corner: Chevy Blazer
Two uniformed  get out, and fumble with their sidearms
Everybody
chill
Bikini boy
On the ground
Asshole #2 is still trying to gouge Carson with the screwdriver
Carson glares at the dopey Guards
Asshole was trying to boost my car
Carson's fiftyish, black, next-door , wearing pajamas and a robe, comes out of his house
Carson sees him
Mike -- call 911
Been trying
(has a cordless phone) It's busy
(to Guards; re Carson) He's the good guy, you schumcks
The Guards seem to get it
Without warning, one takes out a and  Asshole #2
Carson lets go just in time
Holding his bleeding side, Carson walks back to his house
He notices the "Neighborhood Watch" sign has graffiti spray- painted on it
He touches it -- the paint is still wet
His Neighbor shrugs -- whatta ya gonna do
The   drives by
and tosses Carson's newspaper right under the gushing
hate this fuckin' town
-  - -   - Joy is standing on the toilet, blowing cigarette smoke into the exhaust fan
Someone  on the door
She flicks the cigarette into the toilet, puts a   in her pocket
-  - Joy opens the bathroom door
Sam is standing there, grinning
There are six bathrooms in this house, Sam
(fanning the air) But only one with a smoking section
She quickly closes the door behind her
Sam laughs
-   - Sam and Joy sit at the table
and
are having breakfast: radish soup, kimchi and grilled fish
Ambassador Han reads through the morning's faxed communiquEs
He's 43, rarely smiles, and hates living in the
He's dressed in an impeccably-tailored, Valentino two-piece suit
Mrs
Han is slender, soft-spoken, but as iron-willed as her husband
She, however, is quick to smile
She's wearing a summery dress with a white sweater over her shoulders
Ambassador Han pulls the front of Sam's shirt to reveal the "Nirvana" logo on his -shirt
(Korean) [Go change
] Ambassador Han's -ray stare turns to Joy
(continuing) [You smell like a fireplace
] appears with a phone
He  to Mrs
Han
It's the Governess
(into phone) Hello, Hilda
- as she speaks into a cellular phone
She's extremely nervous
We cannot see her surroundings
(thru phone) Mrs
Han
am very sick today
-   - (into phone) We will see you next week
(hangs up; smiles to kids) It appears 'll be taking you to school
'  - In the back of his van, Javal pats the Governess' hand
Very good
You may go now
He speaks with a slight accent, French, perhaps
He pops an orange pill, then unlatches the rear doors of the van
With a quick glance back at him, she goes to open the doors
Javal grabs a plastic tarp and throws it over the Governess' upper body
He puts his arm across her neck, flicks open a gravity knife and  it through the tarp, into her chest
He drops her on the floor of the van and fastidiously wipes a small smudge of blood from his hand with a handkerchief
'  -    - Carson steps out of the shower
He looks exhausted
Toweling off, he goes into the bedroom, where Miranda is riding an exercise bike, listening to music on headphones and reading the sprinkler-soaked newspaper, all while watching the
perky blonde traffic reporter,  , talks to us from a local
(on ) Good morning, Summit Day
It's gonna be the Super Bowl, the 4th of July, the Olympics and Woodstock all rolled into one
All over town there'll be parades, concerts, rallies, festivals
So get out there everyone, but plan your drive- time accordingly
This is Bobbi Marchfelder, your Eye in the Sky
We   the White House lawn, where the  is about to board a helicopter
() (on ) The President is on his way
(on ) It's an honor hosting my fellow leaders in Los Angeles, the capitol city of the Pacific Rim
We   to the studio and the
(on ) We'll see the menu for Mayor Simpson's Brentwood barbecue, right after this
We   a   of preparations for the events around town
As the  swells, Carson turns the  off
was watching that
If  hear one more Beach Boys song, 'll shoot myself
Miranda points at the headphones -- she can't hear him
(continuing; while smiling) said, if we were having sex once in a while, you wouldn't need to ride that fucking bike every morning
(hasn't heard a thing) Be right with you
As Carson dresses, we get a  at their bedroom -- Miranda's nightstand has two neat stacks of periodicals on it, with Los Angeles magazine and Psychology Today on the top of them
Carson's nightstand is overflowing with books and magazines about other cities and states: Wonderland Washington; Magnificent Oregon; Welcome to North Carolina
" /
'  -  &  - Miranda, dressed in a conservative skirt, jacket, black shoes, is out on the patio
Her breakfast -- a bowl of fruit and wheat germ -- sits on the patio table while she waters some sickly-looking   in a planter
Carson, dressed in shirt and tie, looking beat, fries a steak and three eggs in butter
He comes outside with his breakfast and a magazine article: "American Expatriates in New Zealand
" (looks him over) Have you gotten any sleep lately
(ignores the question) Shop's gonna tow the car in -- goddamn ignition's trashed
Take mine
'll ride in with Diane
Carson watches as she carefully picks the dead leaves off the rose bushes
You ask me, those suckers are a lost cause
She continues, then glances at the article Carson is reading
It's not for you
You mean it's not for you
don't chase car thieves in my underwear
'mon, you'd die of boredom if we ever sold this house and moved
'd die of shock, from finding anyone dumb enough to buy the place
Even for what it's worth now
Lots of people bought at the top of the market
That sure cheers me right up
don't know why we even talk about it
The city's not the problem
So we move
It wouldn't matter
What's that saying: "Wherever you go, there you are
" Carson just looks at her
Reaching for the salt, he winces from the cut in his side
(continuing) hope you're current on your tetanus booster
Was it worth it
One cut
two assholes in the hospital
Yep
Carson glances at his watch and gets up
(continuing) Well, another day of baby-sitting my favorite bunch of people
He grabs a Bianchi shoulder holster with a Sig-Sauer -229, 9mm pistol, straps it on, then pulls on a blue windbreaker
Emblazoned on the back are large yellow letters:
Ask for a transfer
They're not gonna transfer me
You know damn well why  was bumped down to guard duty
(as he's leaving) My outstanding people skills
Miranda tries to return to tending her roses
But instead, she sadly watches him go
'  - look of sorrow crosses Carson's face as he watches some laugh and shove, getting onto a school bus
He then glances at his wounded Mustang, parked in the street
He spots something on the windshield:  pink parking ticket
The parking sign above the graffiti-stained Neighborhood Watch sign reads: Street Cleaning - Friday 8-10
hate this fuckin' town
Carson  open Miranda's car: a red Volvo 960
As he pulls away, we  a bumper sticker on the car: a circle and slash through cartoon weapons on one side, cartoon teddy bears on the other, and "Arms Are For Hugging" in between
- The Driver backs the Mercedes out of the garage behind the Consulate
We notice there is   parked inside
Mrs
Han, Sam and Joy come outside
They hear some heartfelt : () Goddamn Limey overpriced piece a shit
In the driveway across the street, a man in a business suit has his head under the hood of a brand-new Jaguar convertible
The  's 15-year-old, blonde daughter, , sits in the car with her schoolbooks in her lap
turns to Mrs
Han: Can we give Lisa a ride
/
- It pulls into the driveway across the street
The Jag Owner is still  mightily
Lisa climbs into the Mercedes
Hey, Joy
Sam
Joy rolls the window up and the  of cursing disappears
(continuing) Excellent --  can't hear him
(raps on window) The glass is an inch thick
(points to doors, roof) Armor-plated
Bulletproof
Bomb- proof
Perfect car for
(looks back at her Dad) Starts, too
- As the Mercedes travels its usual route down Crenshaw, Javal's van begins following it
- where Javal's  is attached, still waiting
- dark-green government Dodge pulls up and parks behind one just like it on a paved area near the Consulate gate
, (chubby, 40, Mexican-American, a desk jockey) gets out of the Dodge and hangs an  shield over his top pocket
He glances over at North Korean Security Chief  , (45), who has paused inside the gate to regard Dave, and the outside world, with profound contempt
Dave, attachE case in one hand and notebook computer in the other, walks to a 10-by-15 detached guardhouse on the far corner of the property, just outside the high fence
-    - Inside are two desks and four chairs, a console of communication equipment, a microwave and a Mr
Coffee
Dave enters
Two  agents, finishing their shift, gather their belongings:  (late 20's; male; thinning hair) and , (early 30's; cute; dark, bobbed hair; female)
They wear blue  blazers and have standard--issue 10mm Heckler & Koch -5 machine pistols in oversized shoulder rigs
Dave is in civilian clothes, and is not armed
Yo, Dave the Computer Man
Actually escaped the office
'm doin' field upgrades
Gives 'em a chance to hose out my cage
He glances through the window at Colonel Lee
(continuing) Who's the fuckin' gargoyle
Their Chief of Security, Colonel Lee
Sabatini makes the jerk-off sign with her hand
"Chuckles," as we're inclined to call him
(yawns; flops in a chair) Friggin' graveyard shift
Love to know what dope made it the Bureau's job to give full-time protection to foreign consulates
(offers coffee to Dave) Cup a mud
Not if you made it
Why don't you get Sabatini to brew the java
She's the alleged chick
Blow me
Where's Carson
On his way
Some creeps tried to rip off his Mustang last night
(beat; solemnly) They cut the ragtop
Motherfuckers
Dave takes three  computer cards from his attachE case
(continuing) Latest and greatest
Wireless network link-ups
Whoa, slow down, 'm gonna pee
Me, too
Ingrates
- The van drives in the lane alongside the Mercedes
'  - ( ) - , Javal drives with one hand, while tapping with his other on the top of the radio-controlled remote box
- As they approach the light at Washington Blvd, just turning yellow, Javal's van gets in front of the Mercedes
Their lanes stop for the red light
holding a bag of oranges walks from car to car
Javal slips the van into neutral and lets it roll back until his rear bumper taps gently against the Mercedes' front bumper
-       - The Driver hits the
The van doesn't move
The Driver glances in the rear-view: There's a Jeep Cherokee tight on his tail, and the in it is busy dealing with a carpool full of 8-year-old
The Driver looks at Mrs
Han, who's peering out the side window, fascinated by the African-American-themed storefronts
They're all festooned with Summit-related banners, and are preparing for a community sidewalk bazaar
Sam, bored, stuffs several pieces of  into his mouth
'  - Javal flips the switch on his radio-controlled remote
Under the Mercedes, the device Javal planted there begins to emit thick, white
- The  pours in through the ventilation system
Everyone inside starts coughing and choking uncontrollably
The Driver grabs his -74 machine gun and pops the door locks
- The Driver, Mrs
Han, Joy, Sam and Lisa pile out of the car
Jittering with excitement, fear and speed, Javal hops out of his van, holding a Benelli -1, a semi-automatic shotgun
He  the Driver in the chest
The  from the shotgun muzzle, however, is unlike anything we've ever seen before: it is blindingly , even in broad daylight, belching a huge cluster of glowing, white-hot magnesium
The Driver flies back against the Mercedes,  his machine gun into the air
The wound in his chest is full of magnesium shrapnel
The other drivers in the intersection see this and go completely nuts
Some duck for cover under their dashboards
Others peel away
few  with oncoming traffic
The Carpool Lady in the Cherokee pushes the kids down on the floor
The Fruit Vendor hides by rolling under a car
Sam and Joy are incapacitated by tear-gas coughing fits
Mrs
Han stumbles toward them, trying to get them to run away
Javal  her, knocking her down
He turns to Lisa, surprised to see her
Sweating, he points the shotgun at her
almost pulls the trigger
then notices Mrs
Han's expression of horror and thinks the better of it
He spots a  in a Ford Escort, peering cautiously over his dashboard to get a look at the action
Javal  the Motorist through the windshield with another bright, searing blast of magnesium
The Motorist and the entire front of his car burst into
Mrs
Han is on her knees, sobbing
Javal grabs her by the arm and pulls her to the back of the van
He opens the doors
You see that 'm serious in my intention, yes
(she nods) If you cooperate, you and your children will be home for dinner tonight
He tightens his grip on her
She nods again, then looks at the kids
Javal shoves her, Sam, Joy and Lisa into the van
'  - He grabs three pairs of handcuffs off a -shaped bar welded on both ends to the inside of the van
He handcuffs one of Mrs
Han's arms, passes the chain through the bar, then handcuffs the other
He does the same with Sam; then handcuffs one of Joy's arms, passes the chain through and attaches the other handcuff to Lisa
Javal hops in his seat and drives away on Washington
- Several people, including the Carpool Lady, rush over to the Driver, who lies  and  on the ground
His hand is halfway inside his bloody pants pocket, holding a small plastic card with the Consulate's phone number on it
- Colonel Lee and a North Korean Army  come running out
starts up a car in the back of the house
-    - Robbins and Sabatini see the commotion and go to investigate
Dave follows
- Ambassador Han runs out
He has a stricken look on his face
(Korean; to Ambassador Han) [You must stay here
] Ambassador Han nods
The  agents run up
To them: Someone took my family
The agents look at each other -- holy shit
Colonel Lee's car to a stop
Sabatini stands in front of it
You got no jurisdiction outside this property
Colonel Lee shoves a big, ugly Tokorev 7
62x25mm-caliber pistol in her face as he's opening the car door
(continuing) Shit
(to Ambassador Han) Yank his fuckin' leash
My men are going
Colonel Lee jumps into the car and it screeches away, almost running Sabatini over
(continuing; to Sabatini) It's a white telephone van, driving west on Washington Boulevard
The agents rush back to their guardhouse
Dave's government Dodge is blocking theirs
Keys
Dave tosses them to Robbins
Sabatini shoves Dave into the back seat
He looks at her, dumbfounded
You're ridin' shotgun
'  - ( ) - Dave is thrown against the back of the seat by the
Cherry
Under the seat
Sabatini grabs the red flashing light, puts it on the dashboard
Siren
don't know
'm never in a fuckin' hurry
- Just as they race out of Fremont Place past the guard gate, Carson, in Miranda's Volvo, comes in on the other side
'  - ( ) - Carson sees the agents in the Dodge and floors the Volvo
He fishtails, making a -turn
He straddles the lanes on Wilshire to pull up next to them
All the cars in front of them swerve to clear out of the way
He rolls down his window
Sabatini shouts over to him: Someone snatched Han's family
White phone van, westbound on Washington
Carson looks like he's been punched in the stomach
Give me a secure radio
Sabatini takes a small two-way   out of her pocket and throws it through her window to Carson
Dropping it in his lap, he punches the gas
Robbins floors Dave's piece-of- shit Dodge, trying to keep up
,  -  - -    - Diplomatic Liaison   is using the reflection in his office window to adjust his necktie
Walther is 30, good- looking, black; a  lifer working his way up the ranks by virtue of his quiet competence
- sticks his head into the office, then shields his eyes from the sight of Walther's sharp new suit
- Someone's been to Nordstroms, big time
Clothes make the man
- But does the man make enough for the clothes
(smiles) The man makes payments on his Visa
Walther's  rushes in
Mr
Walther
priority line
(into phone) This is Diplomatic Liaison Earl Walther
What's the nature of your emer -- (grimaces) Aw, Jesus
not today
(beat) 'll inform channels and get a copter in the air
For God's sake, keep it quiet
Do what you can, but don't endanger civilians or the family
'  - ( ) - Carson drives with one hand, while holding the radio
(into radio) You bet -- nice and easy
Real easy, until he narrowly  a bunch of cars when around a corner
-    - Walther presses the intercom button on the phone
(into phone) Get the Secretary of State on the horn
(listens) know he left already
'm familiar with the concept of time zones
Find his ass
'  - ( ) - Carson turns the frequency on his two-way
(into radio) Robbins, Sabatini
Chopper's on its way
- Driving skillfully, Carson edges past the North Koreans
'  - ( ) - And then, Carson can't believe it: he spots Javal's van, a couple blocks ahead, driving at normal speed
(into radio) Check it out
Ahead, on the right
() (thru radio) Think it's them
(into radio) Yeah
but it seems too easy
'll move up; he won't suspect a civilian car
Stay back, then get on his ass when  signal
We'll box him in
He looks over at Colonel Lee, whose car is pacing his
(continuing; into radio) If the Mod Squad gets in your way, don't be shy about getting 'em out
() (thru radio) Copy that one
'  - ( ) - Glaring, Colonel Lee looks over at the  cars as they pass
'  - ( ) - Sabatini pulls out her machine pistol, and tosses the two-way to Dave
He looks scared, and carsick
Don't puke
hate when guys puke
- Carson tries to approach Javal without drawing his attention
'  - ( ) - He still drives at the same speed as the surrounding traffic
As Carson nonchalantly passes, Javal  the government- issue two-way radio sitting on the seat of Carson's Volvo
grins
it's show-time
He  on the gas
'  - ( ) - Pissed that he's been made, Carson speeds up
'  - ( ) - Driving fast, Javal makes a hard right
As the van leans with the turn, something rolls out from under a sheet of canvas on the floor -- the Governess' , bloodied and grotesque under the plastic tarp it's wrapped in
Joy starts , as does everyone else when they see it
Javal pulls out a Beretta Centurion 9mm pistol and  a deafening round through the roof of the van
need to concentrate
- During a lull in traffic, a -  jaywalks across the street
An  black-and-white changes lanes and puts on its flashing lights
As two  write her a ticket
Around the corner   make a quick exchange of money and a vial of crack
The Cops do notice Javal speeding by, with Carson's Volvo, the Dodge and Colonel Lee's car in hot pursuit
They shove the ticket in the Well-Dressed Woman's hand and hop in their car
/   - Javal turns onto the side streets -- rows of run-down apartment buildings
He takes a circuitous route, gaining a one-block lead on Carson and the others
Then, he makes a sudden turn into a one-way alley
'  - ( ) - Javal hits a remote garage door opener
Ahead, rickety doors on one of a line of detached garages facing the alley  up
Across from the garage, parked parallel against the back of an empty building, we notice a duplicate van
It's facing the same direction as Javal is driving
Javal slams on the brakes, stopping just past the garage, and then quickly backs up into the garage
/ '  - As he pulls in, we catch  of the van slipping backwards into a   that fits tightly around the rear two-thirds of it
As the van comes to a stop, several snap- buckles on the edge of the superstructure spring closed
Javal reaches out the van window and pulls on a rope hanging from the ceiling of the garage
The rope releases the door from the opening mechanism, so it immediately falls
Then, Javal turns several switches on another of his neatly- constructed remotes: -    - Steel straps are holding the steering wheel rigid
set of relays, triggered remotely, start the engine; Engage the transmission; And supply fuel to the carburetor
The duplicate van takes off down the alley
Just as it gets up to speed, Carson and the others round the corner into the alley behind it
As far as they know, they're still chasing Javal
The alley is several blocks long, running parallel to the main road, separated at each block by perpendicular streets
The duplicate van races along, scraping against parked cars and the rear walls of buildings
'  - ( ) - (into radio) He's gonna wrap it around something
- Indeed, as the duplicate van crosses a street, cars swerve to avoid hitting it
It continues into the next alley
Up ahead, a garbage truck lumbers into the far end of the alley, its metal lift-rods extended to pick up a dumpster
() Oh, shit
The duplicate van  into the garbage truck and
Carson, horrified, jumps out of his car
Robbins and Sabatini run up
They have to hold Carson away from the burning van
Dave hurries to the back of a building and gets sick
Colonel Lee, wide-eyed with anger, gets in Carson's face
You should not have interfered
Carson shoves Colonel Lee out of his way, hard
'm in no mood
Colonel Lee comes back, ready for a fight
Carson is happy to oblige, but Robbins grabs Carson's arm
Forget about him
By now,  have begun to gather, as  black-and whites and helicopters converge on the area
- block away, the garage door opens, and we hear something eerie and unexpected: a scratchy, music-box kids' , coming from a loudspeaker
Javal's van pulls out and we see its : The superstructure surrounding the body of the van makes it look like a graffiti-covered, unlicensed ice cream vendor
- The entrance of the alley is blocked by a black-and-white
So, accompanied by the , Javal drives along the one-way alley in his camouflaged van, passing unnoticed by the authorities
Anguished, Carson is staring at the  duplicate van
: - () - Beverly Thrift  and
: - Carson tries to shake the memory away
He looks around, sensing that something isn't right, then turns to the other agents
Let's get back to the Consulate
Off their perplexed looks, we : - One room, bathroom and kitchenette
laptop computer and peripherals are on a table, along with some cell phones, a toolbox, and some jumbles of electronic circuitry
In the main room, there are three large Lazy-Boy easy chairs, side by side, facing a 27-inch  on a stand
cloth covers two  sitting atop the
The door opens
Mrs
Han, Joy, Sam, and Lisa walk in, rigid with fear
Javal, Beretta 9mm in hand, comes in behind them and closes the door
Javal strips off his sweat-soaked shirt and wipes his face with it
Mrs
Han realizes he's wired to the moon
and it terrifies her
Does anyone need to use the rest room
This will be your last opportunity for a few hours
(no takers) Very well
Mrs
Han, Sam, Joy, please sit here
(indicates the Lazy Boys; then turns to Lisa) And you
what is your name
(after a beat) Lisa
Still holding the Beretta, he grabs a polo shirt from the closet and pulls it on
As the family sits in the chairs: No, Mrs
Han, this one
Thank you
He takes a pair of handcuffs out of his pants pocket
He tries to handcuff Lisa, hands behind her back, but she resists
(continuing; sotto) You afford me some additional bargaining power
But not much
She wilts
Javal cuffs her to the handles of the refrigerator
He puts a strip of duct tape from his tool box across her mouth
He uncovers one of the items atop the : An electronic box with three pairs of oversized,   meters on the front of it
We  neat lines of wires running from each of the chairs up into it
Javal flips one of a row of switches on it; a green light and the meters come to life
(continuing) There
No taping your mouths, no restraints
Please remain still while  explain
The meters on the left indicate sound pressure -- Decibels
There are microphones on your chair backs
If you raise your voices above certain level, putting your meter in the red zone for more than one sustained second, the circuit will be closed
(beat) The right meters indicate motion
There are pressure sensors inside the armrests and seats
The sensors don't like to get wet, so  hope you were honest about not needing to use the loo
If you make any excess movements, or try to leave your chair, the circuit will be closed
don't understand
She looks at her sound meter, which jumped close to the red
(continuing; softly) What happens if the circuit closes
Kaboom
He uncovers the other item atop the  -- a one-pound brick of -4 high explosive with the detonation mechanism jammed into it
Mrs
Han gasps and begins to
(continuing) Easy
deep breath
(to the kids) Do each of you understand
They nod
Tears roll down Joy's face
(continuing) Keep your wits, and all will be fine
He flips another switch and the green light turns yellow
He then turns on the

#1 (on ) Not since the '84 Olympics has the whole city had an such an opportunity -- Javal turns the channel to a , and  it
He starts pacing, and glances at his watch
It's 9:15
- ( ) - Earl Walther looks through the window as his copter lands on the lawn behind the North Korean Consulate
- As the copter lands, Carson comes out to meet Walther
Carson
(Carson nods) Walther
Who told the Ambassador
His Security Chief
(beat) There was a civilian with them -- fifteen-year-old girl from across the street
We're trying to reach the parents
Goddamn it
(sotto) Look, Mrs
Han was the North Korean Premier's niece
We're hearing rumors they're gonna make a major issue out of what happened here
-  - Carson and Walther come into the house
We hear only the of the grandfather clock in the foyer
Colonel Lee and his Officers stand by the stairs; Robbins, Sabatini and Dave stand together near the front door
'm not so sure what happened here
Something smells
Asshole was acting like he wanted us to spot him
What the hell are you talking about
() Mr
Walther
Ambassador Han comes down the stairs, his face tight with repressed emotion
Ambassador Han
my deepest -- --  have no wish for condolences
Just answers
As soon as we have any to give
Suddenly, the Butler sprints across the foyer
He shoves the cordless phone into Ambassador Han's hands
Ambassador Han listens to the phone, then takes in a sharp breath and sits on the steps
(into phone) Yoon
(to  agents) Start a trace
Carson is elated
Robbins, Sabatini and Dave rush out
Walther pulls out a cell phone and hits a speed-dial key
(into phone) Mr
Secretary
they're alive
(to Carson; incensed) You are tapping our phones
(while crossing to Ambassador Han) Yeah, you didn't know
And 'm Meryl Streep
- Javal is holding his cell phone next to Mrs
Han's face
(into phone) We are not hurt
But this man is very serious -- He pulls the phone from her, takes a breath to compose himself
(into phone) want you to remember the feeling you had when you thought your family was dead, and use it to inform the choices you're about to make
-  - Say you want to talk to the kids
(into phone) need to know my children are all right
() (thru phone) Be in front of a television in two minutes
Tune it to channel four
You'll get the picture
Javal hangs up
Stunned, Ambassador Han stands up
There is a television in my office
As Carson, Ambassador Han, Colonel Lee and Walther hurry to the office in the back of the house, Carson's radio crackles: () (thru radio) We're screwed on the trace -- he's on a cell phone
-    - Dave and Robbins watch Sabatini work the comm console
Play the tape back
might be able to pull the electronic serial number out of the subcarrier
() (thru radio) Ask Dave if he knows how to find the phone's serial number
(smiles; into radio) Hey, great idea
-  '  - Ambassador Han turns on the  to channel 4
It's the same medical  that's on at the apartment -- a and  are screwing in a deserted operating room
- Javal is standing in the kitchenette, pointing a at the family
It  as he takes a picture
There is a cable running from Javal's computer to his cell phone
He hooks another cable to the digital camera, and an appears on the screen of his laptop
He clicks on "

They turn as the fax machine on the credenza
An  begins to emerge from the machine: the picture from Javal's digital camera
It shows the Han family sitting in their booby-trapped chairs in front of the
The explosives and the electronics are clearly visible atop the set, as is the program on the
() Oh, Jesus, those're explosives

second page on the fax begins to come through
As it does, the telephone
Carson and Colonel Lee both go for the extension near the sofa; Carson grabs it first
Ambassador Han picks up the phone on his desk
() (thru phone) There must surely be several people in the room; you may put me on the speakerbox if you wish
Ambassador Han clicks on the
Carson and the others look at the second faxed page: a list of instructions
() (continuing; thru speakerbox) am not a terrorist
Your countries' political posturing means nothing to me
So do not waste time trying to negotiate
(beat) The Federal Reserve Bank of Los Angeles can furnish ten million dollars
by 2:00
The required denominations are in the instructions, as is the method of packaging
Be in your car at 3:00 , and drive north on Highland Avenue
will call with where to leave the money, which you will do at 3:30
If  am unmolested,  will call again at 4:00 with the family's location and the method for removing them from their
predicament
Could you please refer to page one
(they look at the photo) Any deviation from these instructions and my device will fulfill its function at exactly 5:00
Ambassador Han looks around, feeling totally helpless
Carson says nothing, trying not to show how uneasy he feels
(to Walther) 'yUngyang must approve the ransom
Of course
The 's top Hostage Negotiator is on the way -- -- Goddamn Negotiator's the last thing we need
This asshole sound like he was interested in bargaining
Walther glares at Carson, then continues to Ambassador Han: We have people who are experts in these situations
We really feel it would be best if you let them coordinate everything
Numb, Ambassador Han nods
(continuing; to Carson) Let's get on it
-    - Robbins, Sabatini and Dave look up as Carson and Walther enter
You're gonna just pay up, count on his good nature to return the family
It's the President's intention to keep this quiet, move forward with the Summit, and work with the North Koreans
Jesus, you've already embarrassed the shit out of us over the phone surveillance -- -- They know their phones are tapped
They tap our fucking phones
That's not the point
The point is not acknowledging it
(beat) We got an international incident brewing, with a country we were practically at war with last year
Our best Negotiator is gonna run point
If you got a problem, you can take the goddamn rest of the day off
This Consulate is my responsibility
Not any more
Carson is stunned
(), we hear a  approaching
(continuing) That's the Negotiator
You do the briefing
Carson shoots a disgusted look at the others, then leaves
: -  '  - Carson turns off the Beach Boys  on the  behind him
Holding Javal's faxes, he's facing Ambassador Han, Colonel Lee and the Hostage Negotiator (whom we don't yet see
) Our worst enemy'll be the city
There are events gearing up all around town, and a dozen world leaders arriving
Add the Friday rush hour and usual
bad behavior and it'll be a nightmare out there by 3
It all works to the advantage of the kidnapper, hinders our pursuit efforts
(frowns) You don't agree
The Negotiator stands and takes the faxes from Carson
It's Miranda, his wife
Her  shield-holder is folded over the breast pocket of her jacket
'm wondering whether to believe him when he says he's strictly motivated by money
(grabs faxes back) You see one word of Peoples'- Liberation, Holy-Jihad, Revolutionary whatever-it-is-we're-pissed-off-about- this-week bullshit in this entire letter
still want to check the  against known politicals, terrorists -- -- Already doing it
We're coordinating with the Secret Service, the  and the
Have someone talk to the , give them a cover story for the media about the crash on La Cienega
Walther comes in and looks at Carson
Why didn't you tell me Doctor Knoll is your wife
This surprises Ambassador Han and Colonel Lee
(while looking at Miranda) If she'd changed her name when we got married,  wouldn't have to
(to Carson) 'm so enjoying this opportunity to finally work together
Jesus, forget  asked
(beat) The cash will be here in an hour
(to Miranda) Any thoughts on the kidnapper's thoughts
Everything indicates he's working alone
And his concerns do seem to be solely about the money
so agree that he's only using the Summit and the tension with North Korea to create extreme motivation to pay the ransom
will bring the money to him
My ass
The hostages are citizens of the People's Republic of Korea -- -- Hey, do  go to the torture chambers in your prisons, tell you how to do your job
All right, you're outta here
Is this the same insubordinate crap you pulled at Beverly Thrift
Carson glares coldly at Walther
'll coordinate the drop
Perhaps that is better
Inspector Carson knows the terrain -- -- Then he can come with me
Walther looks at Miranda
She nods her assent
(firm; to Carson) It's settled
It sucks
But it means we can get on with it
The Americans leave the room
-  - Still fuming, Carson walks ahead
Miranda pulls Walther aside
(sotto) Get one thing straight, Mr
Walther
If the Bureau had listened to Pete, Beverly Thrift never would've happened
- Hands shaking with nerve- and speed-induced jitters, Javal turns two switches on the unit atop the
Two  readouts light up: one shows the current time -- 2:30  -- the other is fixed at 5:00
Below, the  is still on
Javal flips the channels, stopping at a rerun of "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous
" He suppresses a gleeful giggle
That's more like it
He checks the contents of his prescription bottle
Two pills
He takes one, stuffs the bottle in his pocket, and leaves

He angles skyward a tiny dish-shaped antenna on the Device

He rubs his eyes

We got a cabin in Big Bear
By now, was supposed to be a brown blotch in the rear-view mirror
She's helping Walther stack packs of -- into a series of small plastic bags, tying each one off when it's the size of a brick
They then put the individual bags into two larger bags
Robbins rubber-bands a matchbook-sized   in between two packs of cash
He then hollows out a dime-sized space inside a different pack of money with a razor knife
He puts a tiny,  homing transmitter in the space
Carson checks some hand-held receivers
Miranda crosses to him
He'll expect a homing device -- --  expect him to expect it
He'll check the cash with an  detector
(re larger transmitter) Meaning he'll find this one
(re smaller transmitter) This only has a quarter-mile range, but on a frequency too low to detect
(turns off receiver) And  doubt the asshole will have an -ray machine or a metal detector
Why must you always refer generically to criminals as "assholes
" Gosh, you're right
It could undermine their self-esteem and spoil their chances for rehabilitation
You been reading my magazines in the bathroom again
She returns to listening to an  : () (thru recorder) "And my device will fulfill its function at exactly 5:00
" He's really exhibiting pressured speech
big effort here to sound calm
Same with his vocabulary
if he were in control, he wouldn't feel such a need to sound that way
Just tell me if we can use it
If we needle him he could get sloppy and give us an opening, but 'm not going to risk it
This is the worst kind of perpetrator: anything makes him deviate from his carefully- scripted plan, he could become extremely volatile
-   - During this, Colonel Lee stands in a window on the top floor, pointing a    at the  guardhouse
() (thru headphones) Do we have back-up if the bleeper fails
() (thru headphones) Nothing but physical surveillance
-    - It's real important we don't lose him
He didn't go through all the trouble of designing that bomb not to use it
Carson looks at her as the thought of it hits him
Well, it ain't gonna happen

We just received a missive from the North Korean attachE
They say the kidnapping is a
plot to provoke and humiliate them during the Summit

They're just ticked because we don't want the Chinese dragging their asses into the treaty talks
The    refers to his notes
We have a covert operative in place
He reports the hard-liners and moderates in the High Command are arguing about how to respond, should the Premier's niece and her children should be killed

Christ
What about the damn Premier
He's weak
He has to look tough to save face, keep control of hard- liners
otherwise he risks a coup
Which is a real possibility
Most of those old-fart Generals don't want to -more- (Cont'd) be part of the Summit any more than we want them to
They're mad as hell he even talked to the Chinese
(thru video link) don't want to deal with this right now
Get our diplomats on it
Tell the North we'll pay the ransom for 'em
Placate 'em
And make damn sure we get that family back in one piece
Who's in charge in
The Bureau, Sir
We have a crack team in place
There's a Diplomatic Liaison from State, too
(to  Chief) What about your man stationed at the Consulate
(refers to notes) Carson
He was demoted from the Hostage Program, couple years back
And this did happen on his watch
(irritated) There's no way he could've prevented this abduction
Besides, 've got one of my top Negotiators in charge -- (thru video link) -- Whatever

Without giving those Commie little bastards any excuse to shit all over my Summit
- Inside, the grandfather clock in the foyer
Colonel Lee, carrying an -74 machine gun, goes to get in the driver's side of the second armored Mercedes, but Carson is already there
Grumbling, he crosses to the passenger's side
Carson drives off just a moment before Colonel Lee is completely in the car
- The Mercedes crosses Melrose, going into Hollywood
The town is all done up with posters and banners
Robbins and Walther follow a block behind the Mercedes in an unmarked car; Sabatini and Dave drive ahead in Dave's Dodge

Miranda smiles reassuringly at the two nervous fathers

this must be one of those professionals -- (into phone) -- 'm only here to see that everyone gets what they want -- () (thru phone) -- 've got my shotgun in little Lisa's mouth, and  will pull the trigger in five seconds unless you put the Ambassador on the phone
Miranda hands the phone to Ambassador Han
- ( ) - From the two-way radio in Carson's pocket: () (thru radio) The drop is at the DeMille barn, across from the Hollywood Bowl
You're to leave the money in the center of the parking lot

no way we can set up a stake- out in

Call the Park Rangers at the Bowl
Have them clear the area of civilians

we're dealing with a customer with a lot of rage

-   - Robbins and Walther are inching along in traffic on Highland near Hollywood Blvd
Elsewhere, we see unmarked police and government cars cruising around, dropping off disguised - , etc
of twenty aging, weekend-warriors, all on custom Harleys, turn from the Boulevard onto Highland
- Carson drives the Mercedes into the entrance of the Hollywood Museum Park
Carson stops in front of a yellow barn with a sign atop it: "Jesse Lasky Famous Players
" /
'  - Still disguised as an ice-cream truck, the van is parked across Highland by the entrance to the Hollywood Bowl, where a Summit-related concert is being readied
Javal watches the Mercedes, and takes his last pill
He's flying
- Colonel Lee grabs the two large plastic bags full of money from the back seat, opens his door, and drops them onto the pavement
Carson looks around
(into radio) There's about a hundred ways he can scurry off like a cockroach from here
So spread out
Colonel Lee checks their  homing receiver
Carson hangs a left onto Highland, going back the way he came
'  - ( ) - Dave holds their homing receiver
Sabatini, behind the wheel, smacks his arm and points ahead: - Javal's van drives into the parking lot, and stops right above the bags of money
(into radio) Our boy's in a fuckin' ice cream truck
- Sabatini and Dave watch Javal's van through the trees
'  - Javal, sweating and shaking, quickly runs a metal-detector wand over each of the individual bags of money
One of them makes the speaker in the wand handle
'  -      - The van pulls away
Dave glances at the homing receiver
The signal isn't moving
He looks up
Two of the small bags of money are sitting on the pavement
Son of a bitch
(into radio) He found the bleepers -- both of them
- ( ) - (into radio) Fuck
Okay, stay back
It's not like he'll be hard to see in that truck
Which way's he heading
() (thru radio) Toward the freeway
Carson hangs a -turn
- At the complex intersection where Highland ends at the 101, Javal bears to the right, toward the South on-ramp
Sabatini and Dave follow a few cars behind as he gets on it
Suddenly, he scoots over to the shoulder and slams the van into
He backs off the on-ramp, past a row of angry drivers, passing by Sabatini and Dave
Peeling in reverse onto Highland, Javal stomps on the brakes
The snap buckles holding the ice-cream-truck superstructure around his van  , and the whole thing slides off
blocking Sabatini's way
Javal drives forward again, this time getting onto the 101 North on-ramp
-  '  - Miranda looks at Ambassador Han and Lisa's father while anxiously clutching her two-way radio
(into radio) What happened
() (thru radio) We're made
Gotta grab him
(beat; into radio) All right
Carefully
- ( ) - Carson follows Javal onto the freeway
Colonel Lee grabs his -74 machine gun
Watch it
We need him alive
- Colonel Lee leans out and  Javal's rear tires out
The van drives erratically, held in its lane by bumping against the cars around it
Carson pulls up closer
Suddenly, the rear doors of the van burst open
And Javal flies out, riding a motorcycle
He's got the money stuffed into two big, chaps-sized  slung over the back of the machine
He straddles the lanes, going against traffic, riding like a maniac back the way he came
Carson watches him in the rear-view
and speeds up, driving away from him
Turn around
But Carson hugs the shoulder, moving through the heavy traffic, until he spots what he was looking for: The Biker Club, riding in formation up ahead
Carson cuts in front of them and slams on the brakes
He jumps out and grabs one of the Biker's machines by the handlebars, wrestling it to a stop
While pulling its   off it: Call our office, they'll take care of you
Meanwhile, the other  have come to help their friend
They pull guns, knives, chains
They're stopped by Sabatini, who appears holding her -5 machine pistol
The Biker yells at Carson as he drives way: 'm a taxpayer
'm a goddamn dentist
gets in the driver's seat of the Mercedes and turns it around
continues down the freeway on his bike, straddling lanes, driving the wrong way, retracing his route back to Highland, leaving  , , and  in his wake
When everyone thinks they've seen it all, here comes another mad biker -- Carson -- riding against traffic in pursuit
- Javal rides against traffic down the Cahuenga on-ramp, then jumps the divider, runs the light crossing Highland, and gets into the southbound lanes
He just misses a , nearly wiping out
Just don't kill yourself, you piece of shit
Carson fishes out his two-way
(continuing; into radio) Helicopter or two would be nice
-  '  - Listening to the two-way, Miranda tries to follow the action
(into radio) Love to be in the loop on this
- Speeding up, Carson precariously cuts in between traffic
(to himself) Not just now, dear
Seeing Carson approaching on his right, Javal pulls his Benelli shotgun from one of the saddlebags
He rests the barrel on his arm and  a blinding-white load of magnesium at Carson
Carson grabs the brake handles to slow down, and the crosses just in front of him
few  pieces pepper the front fender of the bike, but the bulk  the concrete art- deco statue in the entrance to the Hollywood Bowl
The statue shatters into a million  fragments

maybe some horses
but no, we moved to
speeds up
car passing on the right  him
Javal grabs for the handlebar to stabilize himself,  the shotgun
appears, and flies just above him
Then, spotting some police cars ahead, he quickly hangs a right, ducking onto Alta Loma Terrace
- Carson stops at the entrance to the winding, hillside neighborhood, accessible only by footpaths
The area is covered by thick foliage, hiding Javal from the helicopter
Carson revs down so he can listen for Javal's machine
He it up above and takes off, up a steep flight of stairs
Javal has reached the summit, only to find he's boxed in
He can either turn around, or take the neighborhood's unique, outdoor elevator, housed in a free-standing, three-story concrete tower
He jumps off his bike
Carrying the saddlebags, he runs into the elevator -- but it needs a key to operate
Javal comes back out, panicking
He  Carson coming up the hill
He spots a  watering nearby with a hose
as he reaches the summit
He sees Javal's motorcycle, abandoned, lying on its side
And then he sees the Gardener, sprawled on the ground, a in the center of his forehead
Carson turns off his motorcycle and pulls out his Sig 9mm
He moves slowly toward the elevator tower and looks inside
The casement window in the back of the tower is broken
One end of the gardener's hose is tied to a grate, and the hose is hanging through the broken window
Carson looks out the window as Javal climbs down the outside of the tower on the hose to High Tower Drive, the street below
(into radio) He's on foot, at the base of the elevator tower
But just as Carson is about to climb down the hose
- Javal spots a   backing a tiny Geo out of her garage
He rips her out of the car, jumps in and tears away
- Carson jumps back on his motorcycle and starts it up
(into radio) Goddammit
He's in a blue Geo
- In the Geo, Javal drives out onto Highland
He muscles his way through traffic, then cuts across to Franklin
Behind him, Robbins and Walther drive along the divider lane
On the bike, Carson emerges from Alta Loma, joining Sabatini and Dave in Dave's Dodge and Colonel Lee in the Mercedes as they all try to catch up to Javal
The helicopter flies ahead, then disappears past the hill below Franklin
- Javal hangs a hard right off of Franklin onto Vine, putting him on top of a hill that drops down to Sunset
Carson and Colonel Lee close in on the Geo
Suddenly, the helicopter   from the bottom of the hill
It's less than fifty feet in front of Javal, at eye level
Javal  at the copter with his Beretta
Colonel Lee indiscriminately  his machine gun at the Geo
Carson  at Colonel Lee, furious at his carelessness
- ( ) - Colonel Lee's  trace across the cockpit of the helicopter; one hits the  in the neck
Clutching it with one hand, the Pilot loses control of the copter
- Everyone on the road scatters to get out of the copter's way
It appears as though it's going to crash onto the street, then it gains altitude,  wildly just above the Geo
Javal tries to move away, but one of its landing runners through the top of the windshield,  itself against the inside of the Geo's roof
Snared, the little Geo is  off the ground -- instantly too high for a terrified Javal to escape from it
- ( ) - The wounded Pilot, barely conscious, searches for safe area to set down -- but there are cars and people everywhere
The Pilot wrestles his stick; his copter is almost impossible to control with the car hanging from it
He's fading
- The copter and Geo lurch over and past the round Capitol Records building,  the spindle off the top of it
The impact further destabilizes the copter's flight
It's heading right toward the 20-story Sunset Vine Tower, at the bottom of the hill
'  - ( ) - Javal, trapped inside, looks through the windshield as the glass and steel side of the tower looms closer
He
- The copter and the Geo  into the side of the Tower, 12 floors up
Glass blows out in all directions; the rotor shatters; office furnishings are blown through the hole like backwash
The Geo hangs passenger's side down from the runner
From the series of jerking, slipping , it is clear the copter is not going to stay where it is for long
The Geo's passenger side door pops open
Javal, panting with fear, jimmies his foot against the dashboard and holds the steering wheel to keep from falling out
In the clog of traffic, cars swerve away, rapidly reverse
anything to get away from the area below the impact
reacts to another
The big saddlebags of money on the seat start to slide toward the open door
He gingerly reaches over to grab them
the copter again
he loses his grip
And, clutching the saddlebags, he  out of the car
We stay with him as he  12 stories,
Then  on top of a parking meter
It  though his chest and he hits the sidewalk with a wet
- Carson rushes across the street to Javal's body
The teetering copter and Geo are right above it
Grimacing, Carson tries to lift Javal's body up off the parking meter, but it's messy, slippery work
Unable to move the body, Carson quickly searches its pockets
All he finds is the now-empty prescription bottle
Above, the copter
it's about to come loose
Carson pulls out his Sig 9mm and  several times at Javal's right wrist, then  the  off the body
With a loud  of metal, the copter and Geo break away from the building
Carson grabs the saddlebags and runs like hell across the street, diving for cover behind a car
the copter and Geo crash to the sidewalk and
Sooty, covered in Javal's blood, Carson crosses to the others
He throws Walther the saddlebags and Sabatini the severed hand
Fingerprint it
(to Walther) He's not gonna tell us where to find the hostages
-more- (Cont'd) (looks at watch) Meaning we got exactly 80 minutes to figure it out for ourselves
Figure it out
With what
(ignores him; into radio) Miranda
We need a copter, pronto
(to Robbins) Get back to his van
There were no plates, but check the , look it over, then meet us at the Consulate
Robbins is still trying to process what just happened
(continuing) Go
: -  '  - The clock reads 3:50
Carson, Miranda, Robbins, Sabatini, Ambassador Han and Colonel Lee are all  at once
(to Walther) Scrounge us some bodies: National Guard, State Troopers, CHPs, local 's, meter maids -- -- They're gonna search the whole city in a goddamn hour
Look,  don't need you to tell me how fucked we are
Fuck you
Every time you're on a case something explodes
Carson looks like he's going to explode
Before he can reply: Stop
The clock's running
Arguing is a luxury we can't afford
-more- (Cont'd) (looks at Carson) What's done is done
There'll be plenty of time to point fingers later
Carson would love to get into it, but he lets it slide
He looks Sabatini, wandering aimlessly with Javal's severed hand
need some fuckin' ink
Carson grabs one of the expensive pens from Ambassador Han's desk,  it in half, and hands it to her
In the b
g
she stands at the credenza, inks the hand's fingers and thumb and rolls them onto a piece of letterhead paper
This is impossible
How can you even begin to find them
Good question
All eyes go to Miranda
Well, the normal procedure is to negotiate with the perpetrator
Her head is spinning
She looks at Carson
Let's take stock
We've got a picture of where he hid the family, and recordings of his calls -- -- That's right
We can send them to our experts for analysis
(to Ambassador Han) Same with his fingerprints
But that means we need high-quality image and data transmission
We can piss away ten minutes coptering this shit to our offices in Westwood, or we can use your surveillance equipment
There is no surveillance equipment
This is a diplomatic facility -- -- You want to play games, fine
He turns to go
Ambassador Han turns to Colonel Lee
Take them upstairs
-   - In the converted attic, several North Korean monitor military and police frequencies, downlinks from remote wiretaps and surveillance units; short-wave, cellular, etc
Their equipment, being of Chinese and Iranian manufacture, is hardly cutting-edge technology
Colonel Lee and Ambassador Han enter
The Espionage Agents are surprised when Carson, Miranda, Walther and Sabatini follow
Walther looks around, amazed
Carson grabs a pair of headphones
South Korean Consulate's just down the street -- want to take a listen
Colonel Lee pulls the phones away from him
Carson takes the page with the fingerprints from Sabatini
The Espionage Agents back away from her and Javal's hand
(continuing; re hand) Shitcan that thing, will you
She looks around
Then, shrugging, she tosses it into a wastepaper basket
(continuing; to Colonel Lee) Got a digital scanner
Analog
(looks equipment over) You might want to drop a few bucks at Radio Shack and get with the decade
(into radio) Dave -- get in here
Bring your computer, a city map, and the tapes of the ransom calls
() (thru radio) On my way
He's also , faintly, through the laser eavesdropping unit by the window
Carson notices, but doesn't comment
(to Colonel Lee) Colonel, you saw the perp
Describe him to the Ambassador, see if it's anyone he knows
Colonel Lee begrudgingly obliges
Carson dials a phone
(into phone) This is Carson in
There's a set of prints coming over
Narrow the search criteria: Male, thirties, Caucasian
French, Belgian, Swiss, maybe Canadian
Try kidnappers and bombers first
We need an answer in fifteen minutes
, ,  - headquarters, with the Washington Monument in the b
g
-   - , wearing thick glasses, sits in front of a high- resolution computer monitor
(into phone) That yellow air out there finally rot your brain
It's impossible
() (thru phone) Dazzle me
-   - Carson clicks off the phone, then, as he dials another number: (to Walther) We got one of the best sound guys right here in town
(into phone) Newman in Audio Analysis
() Newman's gone
Dave comes into the room
He quit, couple weeks ago
Opened a bed and breakfast in Wyoming
Carson looks at Miranda and hangs up the phone
(continuing; looks around) Damn
they get
'd sure like to see the fight tonight
Get those tapes transferred to a sound guy
We need ambient and background analysis, the whole enchilada
Enchilada -- you saying that because 'm Mexican
No
'cause you're fat
(picks up Javal's fax) Photo enhancement
Isn't there some amazing tech with the  -- -- Bronsky
Transferred to Seattle a month ago
Jesus
Christ
'd send it to Langley
Let the earn their keep
Do it
Carson tosses Javal's bloody, unlabeled prescription bottle to Miranda
She looks it over, runs her finger inside, tastes the dust on her fingertip
Given his behavior, this orange residue
'd say Desoxyn, 25 mg
Amphetamines
Any significance
It's consistent with the lone wolf scenario:  handful of these is pure bravery-in-a-bottle, 'til the psychosis and paranoia kick in
(beat) We could check pharmacy records, on the remote chance he got them legally
if we had a couple of weeks, that is
(to Sabatini) Get the Bureau on it
Forget it
It's a waste of manpower
Look, goddammit, you start skipping no-chance-in-hell leads, we can all quit and go to the beach right now
Sabatini looks at them -- which will it be
Miranda frowns and nods her okay, then spreads the
map out on the table
(continuing) He grabbed the family at 8:30
The last certain visual we had was just before his van went into the alley on La Cienega at 8:42
He called the Consulate at 9:30
That gives him about fifty minutes to get to his location, move and secure the hostages, and activate his time bomb
He probably waited a while to pad the time -- he wanted us know the family was still alive
(sotto; re Koreans) So these crazy bastards wouldn't throw a premature shit hemorrhage, but he didn't want to call too soon, either
say they're within 15 to 20 minutes, via surface streets, of where we last saw them
He draws a circle on the city map: Beverly Hills to downtown, Hollywood to Inglewood
The most densely-populated part of the
basin
This narrows it down to about 200,000 dwellings
beat while this sinks in
(continuing) He was traveling west -- -- Bet he doubled back
'mon, that's total conjecture -- (re Carson) -- 'd trust his instincts when dealing with maniacs
He is deeply disturbed
You're telling me
-   - Everyone is smoking
Their tension has increased tenfold since we last saw them
The President,  through the video setup, is pacing on Air Force One
North Koreans have gone ballistic, accusing us of botching the ransom drop on purpose
They're still harping on that "American plot" nonsense
(thru video link) Meaning
They say the death of the Premier's niece and her family would justify immediate retaliation
(thru video link) Are they out of their fuckin' minds
What kind of retaliation
Everyone in the room looks at one another
They're threatening to pull a Saddam Hussein: remember the Scuds he lobbed at Jerusalem during Desert Storm
(beat) They're talking about firing a missile into Los Angeles -- (thru video link) --  goddamn
Best guess is an -15, medium-range cruise -- their version of our Tomahawk, launched from offshore
The -15 is gyro-guided
It will find the city, but it's not too accurate beyond that
Still, for their purposes it's perfect: Hit somewhere in
, take out a city block or two
To the eyes of the world it's a measured response -- like what Reagan did to Qaddafi
But actually striking at an American city would be a huge psychological victory for them
(thru video link) don't believe 'm hearing this
(beat) So if we know it's coming, we can knock it out of the fuckin' sky
These weapons fly subsonically, below radar
we don't have the defenses in place
If we'd had the time to deploy a string of Patriot anti- missile batteries across the coast -- (thru video link) -- You're saying we got all this lousy hardware and can't stop one goddamn missile
Everyone's silence answers his question
(continuing; thru video link) want an immediate search for all ships within range
We better inform the other leaders, stall on the Summit -- (thru video link) There's no reason to panic yet -- they can't launch until after the family's confirmed dead
Afraid that's not the case
The Intelligence Officer illustrates his explanation with and  on a nearby  : The North Korean Premier holds what we call a "Brinksman Switch
" He's able to destroy a missile in flight, right up to the moment before it achieves its target
Our Op says they've timed their retaliation to hit right after 5:00
And if the family turns up okay, they'll just make it self-destruct
(thru video link) Shit
really don't need this today
We're forgetting one thing here: the family
Intelligence is sure the North will abort their attack if Mrs
Han and her kids are safely returned
Absolutely
Their whole game depends on claiming a legitimate provocation
Still, we should let them know there'd be a response
if it comes to it
(thru video link) 'd like to turn 'em into a radioactive parking lot
That's the problem: we can't
We're the last superpower
Our hands are tied by politics, alliances, goddamn stacks of treaties
most we could do is give 'em a "measured response" back again, or everyone starts crying that we're the bullies
Damn,  miss the Cold War
Russians wouldn't have dreamt of pulling a stunt like this
(thru video link) Believe me, the North drops one in my fuckin' city, 'm dropping ten in theirs
Get some bombers in the air
And don't tell me any more bad news
- Robbins stands by Javal's van, on the shoulder of the freeway

called 'em; they said the guy paid cash, and he fits our boy's description
Signed the name "Douglas McArthur" to the Transfer of Title
-   - (into radio) Cute
(to Miranda) He signed the name of the Allied Commander during the Korean War
Maybe he was a political
No
The phony ice cream truck, the booby-trapped chairs
he could've -more- (Cont'd) done it without half that stuff
But this was going to be the score of a lifetime
he was showing off
(to Dave) Who's got those kinds of skills: Electronics, vehicle customizing, computers, explosives
Military
Cop, maybe
Shit, your average high-school student if they're so inclined
My guess is our perp used off-the-shelf equipment for everything except the -4, and that's only slightly harder to get than crack or heroin, if you know who to ask

Holding his pistol on the Crew, the Bearded Crewman nods at the Missile Experts
Saluting, they remove the green warhead from the missile
Two  , carrying a metal locker, appear from below deck
The Crew murmurs nervously as they remove from the locker a red warhead and attach it to the missile
Finishing, one of the Experts pushes the firing trigger and the missile  from its launching pad

The sun position tells us the windows are facing northeast

There's a reflection of a reflection, out on the street: the corner of a billboard
Looks like the wheel of a car
We talked about these billboards, when we were car shopping
Four- door
they make a wagon, too

God, what was it
Toyota
Mazda
Honda
You thought it had no character
thought that about all of them
'mon, think, dammit
You think
You were there, too
They're stumped, and bitterly frustrated
To Sabatini: Call the outdoor advertising companies
Get the location of all the billboards for Japanese cars within our search parameters

In 1347 they attacked a Genoese fort, and catapulted infected corpses over the walls
The Genoese who survived carried the disease back to Europe
and it killed half the population

The Intelligence Officer looks at the  Chief
Seems the missile is armed with a warhead carrying the Pneumonic Plague
The President goes nuts
(thru video link) The Black Plague
Every time  talk to you fuckin' guys it gets worse
What happened to this "limited retaliation" shit
The North Koreans insist the missile carries a conventional payload
They say we're trying to trick them into aborting the attack
Especially since the uplink from our Op in 'yUngyang was unencrypted
We think one of the Hard-liners switched the warhead without the Premier's knowledge
But he's not about to take our word for it, and he's too weak to risk the humiliation of backing down
(incredulous; thru video link) They use a biological weapon on American soil, they have to know we'll respond
Maybe they don't think we got the guts
Maybe they want a war, 'cause they think they can whip us, like what happened in 'Nam
Look who we're dealing with: a teetering, outlaw regime, and inside it, some wild-ass renegades working their screwy agenda
(thru video link) What the hell are we doing in
We've deployed Marines from Pendleton and Twenty-Nine Palms, Army from Ft
Irwin, put 'em in protective suits, but it's 40 minutes before they're on the ground

Assuming the worst
What'll happen
The Intelligence Officer demonstrates with another of his The warhead vents the plague bacteria above the target area, infecting about 50,000 people
First symptoms are vomiting, lymph nodes become swollen; temperature rises to 105
Victims turn deep purple from lung hemorrhaging, usually die the same day
(beat) There are treatments -- streptomycin and tetracyclines -- but we'd be overwhelmed by the numbers and its extreme contagiousness
We could have 500,000 infected in a week, who knows how many after that
Long beat as everyone tries to contemplate the unthinkable

Have the Summit leaders been warned
Yes, sir
no one's landing in
'til we give the all-clear
(thru video link) And you're sure it's safe if we can get 'em to destroy the missile in flight
The bacteria can't survive the heat of an explosion
suggest none of this go any further -- not even to the agents working to find the family
Word leaks out to a city of 12 million people there's rocket full of the Plague coming at 'em, you'll create a panic of biblical proportions

Ambassador Han paces
The agents are on a phone or a radio, working leads
Colonel Lee mutters something to Ambassador Han in Korean
Say what
Perhaps someone will decide it is foolish to incur the wrath of North Korea
(crosses to Colonel Lee) Yeah, the
is behind the whole thing
And we're knocking our heads, trying to find your people, just for show
Carson
Let's grab a few beers, kick back 'til five o'clock rolls by
Then maybe we can have a war over it think that's a great idea, seeing as how you fuckers have needed your clocks cleaned for fifty years now
(gets up) Why wait until five
Ambassador Han and Walther keep Carson and Colonel Lee from going at each other
Pete
(sotto) Christ, you're self-indulgent
There's nothing but anger and cynicism left inside you, so they're all you can express any more
No wonder everyone in the Bureau thinks you're such a nutcase
Hey, 'm not the only one with a rep around the office
"Dr
Knoll-It- All

And there are other high-rises nearby

Meanwhile, we hear the high-pitched whine as Dave's connects with another computer
Dave's fingers fly across the keyboard, and in a moment, a  of Javal appears: hair longer, bearded
but the eyes are unmistakable

This sure was a ballsy move for a car-alarm installer
Hey, he watched the news
Everyone knows the
will do anything to avoid trouble with a mad-dog country
They turn, noticing that Ambassador Han has overheard
Ambassador -- -- Quit apologizing for me
Quit giving me reasons to
(to Carson) On occasion, my wife has been known to kick my ankle under the table
Miranda gives Carson a "your turn to be gracious" look
Sounds like her aim's a little low
Not exactly what Miranda was hoping for
Dave hands Carson a piece of paper
Address, according to the Auto Shop
(looks at paper) Apartment 1060
He's in a high-rise
Sabatini -- you're with us
(off Robbins' disappointed look) She's got the field experience
Carson and Miranda grab their jackets, then she stops
There still could be accomplices
If there are, they'll hear us in the helicopter
Carson looks again at the address
There's a  station a couple blocks away
We'll land on their pad

Bobbi intercepts Carson, Sabatini, Miranda and Colonel Lee on the pad
Her Cameraman follows,  camera on his shoulder, videotaping everything
Oh, great, the media
(realizing) It's the goddamn traffic girl
Traffic person
Where are you going
We can't get into that right now
Hey, you expect to use my station's facilities and not even tell us -- Carson grabs the  camera, pops the videotape out of it and crushes the tape
(to Bobbi) Sorry
(looks Miranda over) What the fuck are you, the Barbie Corporate Ass-Lick model
Miranda is utterly aghast
She reaches under Carson's jacket and takes the handcuffs off his shoulder rig
She grabs Bobbi by the arm and gets her in a half-Nelson
Guess what, Sister
you're about to spend the next five years in a penitentiary for interfering with a federal investigation
The   comes running out of the building

- The Lexus is stuck in a dense knot of traffic
Carson gets out and walks across the hoods of the stopped vehicles around him -- to much  by their owners -- until he finds the reason for the jam-up: Along the shoulder of the road, a long line of equipment trailers and motor homes, cables, lights, rent-a-cops and gawkers
Carson groans
He hurries back to the Lexus
Miranda rolls her window down
We're hoofing it
Miranda and Colonel Lee immediately get out of the car and run off, leaving Sabatini to contend with it
(pissed) 'She's got the field experience'
To park the fuckin' car

- Carson, ( jacket folded over his arm) Miranda, and Colonel Lee rush into the lobby
Carson is about to show the  behind the desk his i
d, but the Concierge is nervous and sweating
Carson pulls out his Sig 9mm, approaches the door behind the desk, which is ajar
He pushes it open
And finds himself staring at the muzzles of three -16 rifles
Three   members are standing there in full body armor
(pulls out his i
d
) Whoa
They lower their weapons
(continuing) How the hell you get here so fast
#1 They're shootin' a cop movie down the street
We're workin' as extras
Terrific
Who else is here
#1 Three officers on the roof, next building over, and two in the tenth- floor hallway

Carson and Miranda creep quietly along the hallway, toward apartment 1060
Carson listens at the door, hears nothing
He moves to the next door down, apartment 1058, and quietly unlocks the door
- #1058 - The shades are drawn, and the apartment is dark
As Carson and Miranda cut through the apartment, they realize there's a  lying in the bed
She's naked, and she's not alone
Someone is under the sheets
The first Woman opens her eyes, sees the intruders, and grabs for a Colt Gold Cup
45 auto in the dresser drawer
What the fuck
Her friend sits up
Miranda holds her finger to her lips and shows them her  shield
Sorry
Carson cranks open their window and steps out onto the foot- wide, ornamental balcony
(to Miranda) Wait here
She begins to protest
He shoots her a look that silences her
- The  sharpshooters watch from the next building over as Carson, ten floors up, peers through the slit in between the curtains into the window of Javal's apartment
He swings his legs over onto Javal's ornamental balcony
the bolts holding the rail onto the wall are loose and rusty
the balcony  a little
He leans on the crank-operated window until it  open
- '  - Carson steps inside
He looks around the bedroom -- it's empty
No furnishings, the closet shelves are bare, even the pictures on the walls are gone, leaving only their outline
Carson cautiously goes into the living room -- It's also empty
All that remains are a few cardboard boxes, and three flower pots in macramE ceiling hangers by the living room window
Some dead leaves lie on the floor beneath them
(into radio) 'm in
It's empty, but sit tight while  look around
Carson cautiously approaches the cardboard boxes
- #1058 - The clock on the bedstand reads 4:25
Miranda smiles uncomfortably at the two naked women together in bed
like what you've done with the place
-  - The elevator
Sabatini comes out, & -5 in hand
Team #2, standing on the far side of the hallway with Colonel Lee, sees her machine pistol and takes aim
Wait
Colonel Lee walks over to Sabatini
Where's Carson
Inside
Sabatini starts down the hall
Colonel Lee stays where he is
- '  - Carson cautiously peers in the moving boxes
They're empty
He crosses to the front door, looks it over, unlocks the deadbolt
He turns the knob, the button  open
He stops, noticing a   in the doorjamb where a piece was cut, then neatly replaced
Then, he's startled as he hears a strange, mechanical whining coming from the kitchen
He goes to investigate -- it's an almost-dead, avocado-green refrigerator straining to start its compressor
He looks for booby-traps, opens it, and looks inside
Empty
Looking down, he notices he's got a dead leaf stuck to the bottom of his shoe
Glancing in the living room, he sees the dead leaves on the floor below the three hanging plants
He looks at the plants: two are dead
The one in the middle is not
It's plastic
We  the jiggle of the front doorknob
-- Too late
The front door opens
Carson crouches behind the big, heavy refrigerator door
As the middle flower pot
It's a shrapnel bomb: it spews thousands of tiny carpet tacks 360 degrees around room
Sabatini is  full on -- she falls backwards into the hall
- #1058 - Miranda and the women in the darkened bedroom  as the tacks tear hundreds of  through sections of the wall
Tiny shafts of  appear in the wall, except where it is covered by furniture (keeping them from being shredded
) -  - Team #2 and Colonel Lee come running, as does Miranda
Carson is kneeling next to Sabatini
She looks up at him and tries to say something, but a only long, mournful, final escapes her
Agonized, Carson looks around
And sees Colonel Lee
He lunges for him
said keep everyone back
He punches Colonel Lee in the jaw
Colonel Lee slams against the wall, then comes back at Carson, hitting him in the throat
Stop it
Miranda and  Team #2 pull them apart
(to Colonel Lee) Get out of my sight
He kneels next to Sabatini, and closes her eyes

Miranda looks at Carson, who's trying real hard not to let Sabatini's death slow him down
(into radio) What's the status
() (thru radio) Wilshire and West  Divisions had seven vehicles running with sirens at 9:32
They're getting the routes from the officers now

He glances over at Miranda
After a beat: (continuing) should've known she'd come up
Pete -- -- "Should've
" Shit, there's a familiar word
(long beat) That day

We should've rushed 'em, before they could finish setting up
The Bureau never would've let you

Carson looks out the window, not hearing a word she says

The    wires up a series of explosive charges
Both Robbers rush inside the vault, and pull the door closed to protect themselves
The front of the building, where the hostages are,
Carson runs to the bank
He spots the kid's ball, rolling in the street
He turns away, horrified, devastated
: - ( ) - Twelve bodies -- only the hostages
You were a greenhorn
It wasn't your decision
You can't keep living as such a raw nerve, never sleeping -- -- Those kids were ten years old
(sotto) Same age as the Han boy
He turns away
She takes his hand

Carson looks at Robbins, Dave and Walther, then at the empty chair where Sabatini had been sitting
'mon
Who's pulling Javal's bank records
What about cross-referencing possible aliases
We got 33 minutes
Hearing Beach Boys  on the 's and radios on the surveillance console, Carson angrily punches them all off
Suddenly, Miranda looks at him: Camry
The billboard
Toyota Camry

Parker Center's making those calls

(on ) warning was radioed to
Intelligence that a biological weapon, allegedly containing the deadly Pneumonic Plague, is approaching Los Angeles
While unconfirmed, the President and other leaders are all late in arriving
-   - The 's are off -- so they see none of Bobbi's report
Carson crosses to Dave
He's at his computer, looking at a long column of telephone numbers
Finally got the call list from Javal's phone
Most aren't his; they're from the legit user who didn't know his number was cloned
Go to the bottom of the list, work back through the last 12 hours
Dave jumps to the bottom, points at a number
Here's the call to the Consulate -- 965-5000
(while scrolling) The rest are dupes
all from the other guy
Wait

the one at seven this morning
Dave highlights a number: 213-965-5666
Carson glances over at the telephone on Colonel Lee's desk
() - from when Carson took a call there, pushing the mute button
() - on the label showing the phone's extension number: "x666
" Across the room, Colonel Lee is watching Carson intently
Carson turns to look at him
They make eye contact
Time stands still
Realization

Colonel Lee grabs the -74 machine gun on the desk

Gunsmoke hangs in the air as Carson scrambles to Miranda
Several  have begun ringing
No one notices them
Dave never moved -- he sits hunched over, clutching his notebook computer, muttering the
Carson rolls Miranda over
She's got a large, scorched bullet hole in the front of her blouse
Carson tears her blouse open
She's wearing a kelvar vest under it, and the slug is mushroomed against the vest
She awakens,  and starts swinging her fists at him
Carson is overwhelmed with relief
Then he notices Robbins, bleeding profusely, propped against the wall next to Walther
Walther is dead -- shot in the head
, we hear several  of machine gun fire, and a car roaring to life
Miranda looks at Carson
Go
- The city's reaction to Bobbi's announcement is immediate and severe
It makes the panic during the '92 riots look like a drive in the country
- Carson bursts through the door just as the second armored Mercedes  through the wrought-iron entry gates
Carson fires several , which ping harmlessly off the Mercedes
Carson sprints for a car
Miranda's Volvo is the closest one

Ambassador Han responds by putting on his seat belt
Carson sighs and tears out of the driveway

Seeing the helicopters and  in bio suits only fuels the hysteria
We hear news  coming from car radios, boom boxes, 's
Reporters chatter urgently in English, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, Farsi, their voices mixing with the shouts of pedestrians, the rumbling and horn-blowing of the traffic
Everyone, everywhere is getting into their cars in a mad dash to get out of town or rendezvous with loved ones
This is the mother of all rush hours
- Colonel Lee's car turns right onto Western Avenue
He's in the heart of Koreatown -- hardly any of the signs are in English
He swerves through the panicked drivers jamming the roads -- in the center lane, or into the oncoming traffic
The cars he crumple against the Mercedes without slowing it down
Carson's Volvo follows, squeezing through traffic in its wake

The Colonel hired Javal, made it look like he was working alone
Then he made sure Javal got killed, so we'd never find your family -- and they'd have an excuse to drop their bomb
But what's in it for 'em
There are men in my government whose power depends on North Korea staying as it is: Socialist, repressive, isolated from the world
They'll resort to anything, even war, to keep it that way
They have the Hitler Syndrome: if their country cannot exist the way they want it, they would rather see it destroyed

The copter has landed behind an - Minimart/gas station
Bobbi, her Pilot and her Cameraman turn when they hear a on the windshield of their copter
Oblivious to the panic on the streets, a raggedy stands with a spray bottle, wanting to wash the windows on the copter
Bobbi gulps some Mylanta and waves him away: Save it for someone who gives a shit

So much for "Fun Fun Fun" and

Ambassador Han braces himself on the dashboard
Carson looks over at him
That Kraut-mobile have any weaknesses you'd like to tell me about

As Carson moves forward, Colonel Lee's window opens enough to allow the barrel of his -74 machine gun to poke through
Carson shoves Ambassador Han's head down and ducks
Colonel Lee  the Volvo
Carson looks up just in time to see
pickup truck, ahead, stalled on the shoulder
Carson slams on the brakes, but it's too late

The Paramedic is the one who helped him and Ambassador Han out of the Volvo
Carson yanks him out of his ambulance
Sorry

Miranda climbs in the passenger's side
As he peels away, Miranda smacks Carson on the head
You're completely deranged
Playing chicken with rockets
Well, what the hell were you doing out there

Carson turns, surprised and annoyed to see Ambassador Han, his arm bandaged, lying in the cot in the back

Meanwhile, Cops, Army, Marines, etc

Major Vreeland is among them
The news media,  cameras bouncing on their shoulders, run alongside them
Carson races over to grab Colonel Lee, who is slogging out of the lake
There is a glint of bright steel
and Colonel Lee at Carson with a knife
Carson moves aside

He yells some at Colonel Lee
After a moment, Colonel Lee sags
Let him up
Carson's not so sure, but they're completely surrounded by military and law enforcement personnel
He releases his grasp
Miranda removes her heel
Then, with lightning reflexes, Colonel Lee grabs Vreeland's Rock Island Arsenal Colt
45 Auto from its snap-holster
Victory
Carson dives back onto him
But he twists his arm around and the trigger -- with the muzzle underneath his own chin
Carson, Miranda and Ambassador Han are  with his blood

We're screwed

Shaking his head, Dave glances at his computer
Just in time to glimpse the words "First & Last + Deposit" on one of the checks as it scrolls off the screen
fumbles to scroll back to the check
(into radio) Wait
One of Javal's alias accounts: check for an apartment rental

Joy carefully slides her arm along the arm rest, then tries to coax something out of her pocket -- her Zippo lighter
Mother
Sam
They look over at her as she lights it
After a beat, Mrs
Han understands
She hesitates, then: Do it
Joy drops the lighter to the floor, then swats it with her foot to Mrs
Han
She does the same, passing it to Sam, who's sitting closest to the window
With one eye on the  movement meter, Sam kicks the lighter, sliding it across the carpet toward the curtains
- Several  and  burst into the office
Milton, the Assistant Manager, cowers as they  the lock off the door to the inner office and rush in
It's a brown binder
Says "Rental Manifest
" You can't miss it
They literally tear the office apart

Thick, toxic  begins to fill the tiny apartment, and everyone starts coughing

(into radio) Apartment number would be real helpful, gang
Miranda points to a wisp of  above one of the towers
There
They come around, and spot the  in the apartment's window
It is nine stories up, four stories below the top floor
-    - The coast looms closer
-    - The Apache hovers parallel to the apartment, 20 feet away
Carson feeds out a steel cable from a winch
Then throws a spring-loaded grappling hook onto the thick, iron balcony railing
Hanging onto a webbed rescue harness, Carson slides quickly across the line, onto the balcony
Using the butt of his Sig 9mm, he  a hole in the glass on the locked sliding glass door
He reaches through and unlatches it
- The  have engulfed both sets of curtains and have begun to creep across the floor and the ceiling
Carson glances over at the electronics on the : 4:55
The family is coughing from the smoke, trying not to panic
In the kitchen, Lisa can't cough through the tape on her mouth
She's freaking out
Seeing this, Carson runs over to her and pulls the tape off
She starts , so he grabs her face
Okay
work with me here
He grabs one of the refrigerator handles and pulls, but it won't come loose
Lisa cries out in frustration
Hurry, please hurry
Carson spots Javal's toolbox
In it, he finds a socket set handle, which he levers in between the refrigerator handle and the door
He rips one handle loose, then the other
Carson turns his attention to the booby-trapped chairs
Lisa sits on the floor, frantically pulling her handcuffed hands around her feet so they're in front of her, then runs for the front door
Just as she reaches it: '
He grabs her before she opens the door
There's a small magnetic sensor at the top of the door jamb
(continuing) We have to go out the window
Can't you disarm the bomb
Too risky
Let's concentrate on getting you out of here
He looks at the meters on the electronic units
(continuing) Sound detectors
Sam covered them with chewing gum
High-tech problem, low-tech solution
Carson looks at Sam, impressed, then peers under the chairs
Pressure sensors
Use 'em in convertibles: Bad guy sits on your seat, he sets the alarm off
These are rigged backwards -- get up, you set 'em off
You a bomb expert
Nope
But 've had some car alarms in my day
(to himself) For all the goddamn good they do
Carson looks around, thinking
He spots the roll of duct tape on the table, grabs it and unrolls a long piece
(continuing; to Mrs
Han) Slide your arm forward
Watch the meter
Keep the pressure on the armrest with your elbow
He wraps the armrest with tape, cinching it tight
(continuing) It'll squeeze the sensor, duplicate the weight of your arm
Okay
pick it up
They look at each other, scared
After a beat, she does
The meter
but stays in the black
Everyone sighs with relief
Carson repeats the process on her other armrest
(continuing; to Sam) Low-tech solution
(to Mrs
Han) Lean back
Carefully
Carson feels for the sensor in the seat, finding it buried under Mrs
Han's thighs
He runs a long piece of tape around the seat and wraps it tightly
He tries to lift Mrs
Han, but the meter moves to the red
() (thru radio in his pocket) How's it going in there
(to himself) Nag, nag, nag
He wraps another piece of tape around the seat, and tries again to lift her
This time it works

The Apache helicopter  outside is making an incredible racket
Carson is helping Joy get free of her chair
As she stands, the pieces of her hair stuck to the gum over the microphone head begin to  the gum away
Mrs
Han sees the meter heading for the red, and the yellow warning light flashing
She grabs Carson's arm
Carson quickly covers the mic
The meter drops to zero
The  is spreading across the carpet and walls
Carson is hurrying everyone out onto the small balcony
He helps Lisa into the rescue harness
She's terrified
You'll be over in five seconds
She nods
Miranda pulls her across the cable and send the harness back
Carson turns next to Sam, but he stands back so his sister can go
One minute

sends Sam across
the harness comes back
he straps Mrs
Han into it
Tell 'em 'm gonna release the hook and ride down on the line
He pushes her across
As soon as she's there, he gestures to the Apache Pilot to move closer so he can release the hook
Thirty seconds

slides back across to him; Carson grabs it with one hand and tries to undo the hook buckle with the other
But the cable is crooked, and the buckle is  -- if he can't release it, he's stuck there
Carson tries to free the hook, but it's dug in between the concrete and the railing
Fifteen seconds to go
Carson looks over at the helicopter and waves them away
(shouts) Release the cable from your side
Get out of here
(shouts back) Come over the railing
Grab onto the harness
- ( ) - Miranda turns to the Pilot
Tear the hook loose
It'll pop the winch buckle
Try it anyway

The Apache helicopter backs away from the high-rise
The cable pulls taut
Carson wraps the webbing of the harness around his wrist
The Apache  against the resistance of the cable
The entire railing around the balcony  away, with Carson on the harness next to it
The helicopter turns and flies away
- The bomb , blasting a huge hole in the tower
All the windows in the nearby towers and apartments
is engulfed in the
We can't tell if he's alive

- ( ) - The force of the blast  them like a tidal wave
The Pilot fights to keep control while looking for a place to set down
Huge chunks of debris, glass, furniture, etc
rain down
Carson and the section of railing underneath the helicopter swing like a pendulum from the force of the blast
Groggy, he loosens his grasp on the harness, and jumps clear as the helicopter lands
Miranda leaps out of the Apache and runs to him
Dust and debris from the explosion hang in the air; helicopters crisscross the scene
Everyone turns their eyes skyward, looking for the missile
'   - ' - ( ) - The Premier and the High Command are watching the action at Park LaBrea on  Live
As Ambassador Han embraces his family

- The cruise missile , completely obliterating it
-      - The lead jet cuts away, turning around
The others follow
- The Han family crosses to Carson, blackened and bloody, sitting on the curb next to Miranda
Ambassador Han shakes his hand
Mrs
Han and Miranda cry
Joy and Sam grin at him
After a beat, Carson gathers the kids up in his arms
It is a profound catharsis for him
'   - ' - General Kai is getting into his car
He look up as an approaches

The Officer pushes his body into the passenger's seat, gets in, and drives off

Carson hangs up, and  off the  as he leaves the room
The sound of   continues ()
'  -  - Miranda, wearing a bathrobe, is  her sickly roses
Carson comes outside
Who was that on the phone
The Bureau
(beat) They want me back on the hostage team
What did you say
Told 'em 'd sleep on it
Miranda smiles, then looks at him, surprised, as he crouches down and helps her turn the soil around the rose bushes
They work in silence
Then, tentatively, she leans over and kisses him
Soon they're in each other's arms, holding tight
'  -  - Still entwined, Carson and Miranda stumble in
While kissing: Working with you today was certainly
interesting, Inspector
It's my outstanding people skills
He slips her out of her robe and they fall onto the bed
It is a tender, romantic moment
Until, (), a   goes off
Miranda bolts up

Carson ignores the  -- and Miranda's comment
He pushes her back onto the bed and turns off the bedside lamp
All of the books and magazines about other places to live spill from his nightstand, onto the floor
