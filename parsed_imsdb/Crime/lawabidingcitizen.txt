Trembling fingers miss, try again

The phone rises, gripped tightly
Knuckles white
We're , it's dark, we see no face -- just slack, trembling lips
Whoever it is, he can't talk
All we hear is breathing, all we sense is grief and panic and deep shock

He's pulled from frame
, following into the house
Dark as hell inside
And tense
Arms training weapons
Moving up a tight hallway, emerging into
where the flashlight beams find blood-spatter patterns
Furniture shattered and overturned
kid's sneaker
The flashlights play across   in the wreckage -- a woman's pale hand, a child's motionless leg
to the cops' faces, as: #1 (unsnaps shoulder radio) Dispatch, we have multiple 10-55s, need full response, 11-41

The eye of the storm is Clyde on the lawn, hugging his knees, fetal with horror and grief
He's screaming at the sky, but no sound is coming out
enter shot, steal the frame, race toward the door

, revealing the room, light filtering through blinds, as: When  found my wife and child dead, my little girl's eyes were open
(pause) The last thing she saw of this earth were the faces of the men who took her life
Can you understand that
(
) Yes
Yes,  can
Can you
Really
(looks to somebody else) You
(
) Mr
Clyde
don't see this helping
No
You married
Children
/ to include
, Senior Attorney for the State
He wears thick glasses and is suffering the early stages of macular degeneration
Divorced
have a son and daughter
Both in college
My daughter was ten
married late in life
Clyde spreads the crime scene photos further on the table
to reveal the third man in the room: The
under Cantrell -- focused, exceptional at what he does, the man you'd want on your side
You, Mr
Price
Married
Kids
Nick doesn't answer, stays focused on the task: 've seen the crime scene photos, Mr
Clyde
Many times
They're horrifying
But they don't alter the facts of the case
-   9-19-08                                        4
Facts
Those men are guilty
Both of them
You know they are
This isn't about what we know
It's about what we can prove in court
Things have gone against us
Tainted crime scene, evidence thrown out
Maybe you just haven't tried hard                     * enough
Look
We've had only one real break in this case
The fact that one asshole has decided to testify against the other asshole
In return for immunity
So he gets away with it
The other man doesn't
He'll go down for the crime
That has to count for something
Yes
It counts for half
(pause, quietly) Don't reward one of the men who murdered my family
Please
Mr
Clyde
can't claim to know what it's like to be in your position
Losing your wife and child
But please try to grasp how limited our options are
This is how the justice system works
Clyde sits for a long moment, numb, absorbing this
Ah
see my mistake
came for justice
Instead  got a system

Sorry
My fault
It's okay
On he goes
Nick and Cantrell exit the room
You're due upstairs in three minutes
You're gonna be late
Thank you, voice of doom

Sarah's at their       * heels, sensing the tension and keeping her mouth shut

Do the math
Cantrell has trouble seeing the elevator button, misses
Nick presses it for him

Nick shoots him a withering look, glances back at Sarah
What do you think

She's                      * just an intern

Young lady
Someday you might have our jobs
You know the issues of                      * the case before the court
Speak
Okay
Um
You can take both men to trial, spend a year and millions of taxpayer dollars, and probably lose
Or you can cut a deal and at least put one of the men who did the crime on death row
It's a no-brainer
* You make the deal

Satisfactory to all

Nick places a document before , along with a pen
Clarence Darby
This document guarantees that you will provide testimony against Rupert Ames in the matter of which you were both accused
In return, you will be () -   9-19-08                                           7
(') shielded from further prosecution for those capital crimes
But you will plead guilty to the lesser charge of breaking and entering
You'll do a maximum of five years
With good behavior, you could be out in three
That also depends on your testimony and the level of your cooperation
Your Honor need not worry on my account
assure the court that am aware of the opportunity 've been given
And  am deeply grateful to all concerned
Nick gives Cantrell a glance, both stoically enduring this proceeding
Darby pulls the document closer
If  may
It has come to my attention that Rupert Ames has been spreading                   * lies about me to the tabloid press
* About certain alleged activities of                   * which  have no knowledge
Sexual and otherwise
Libel and slander
yes
(dryly) You can always sue him
Well, no matter
My tongue will wag in court, under oath
His tongue will wag in hell
He puts pen to paper, looks to Nick
He'll get the chair
We don't do chair
We do needle

-    -                    11 Cathedral-like, pigeons fluttering
The door from the hallway opens and , a months-old   , bounds toward us on a leash pulling Cantrell toward the top of the vast marble staircase
Nick trails them, nervous as hell: -   9-19-08                                         8
Whoa, Jonas, take my elbow
* 'm not blind
Yet
'll do it
You're shitty on stairs
At least let me take the leash so the dog doesn't pull you down
No
She needs to imprint on me
Not you, not somebody else
Cantrell starts down
Nick's at his side, hovering and ready to grab him, jumping at every little lurch Cantrell makes
That's the whole point of this phase
She needs to get the idea that she and  are partners
Then the real training can begin
Unless you wanna lead me around the rest of my life
'll pass

We thought the house was empty
Rupert found the woman and child at home and went crazy
was stoned and in fear of my own life, so  fled
They catch sight of Bill Reynolds, the defense attorney
Bill
You let all your clients give testimony on the courthouse steps
Hellooo, kettle to pot
Since when do you shy away from publicity
Since everything in this case has gone sideways so far
Tell your boy to save it for the courtroom
-     9-19-08                                        9
He's your boy too now
You tell him
Reynolds proceeds down the steps
Asshole
Dickwad
Fuckface
and vanishes in the crowd
Nick glances sourly toward Darby
and may  say for the record how very sorry  am that  failed to prevent Rupert Ames from committing those terrible crimes
You good here
Long as nobody bumps into me
Nick through the crowd toward Darby
been given a chance to put the drugs and foul living behind me
To atone for my past failings and weakness of character
It is a gift given me by God's grace
Darby sees Nick, grabs his hand, shaking it for the cameras
and the grace and wisdom of this court
cannot thank you enough, sir
cannot
Nick caught off guard before the     * press, Darby not letting go
Then Nick sees:                      * ' Clyde, a tiny defeated figure far below, waits at the bus stop
He's gazing up, seeing this photo op happen

Marshal, escort your man, please
(to the reporters) Mr
Darby is done here
Darby is hustled down the steps
The reporters surge to Nick, surrounding him, shouting questions
Nick looks over their heads and glimpses Clyde getting on a bus
The door closes, the bus pulls away

Nick enters behind her
She cranes back for a kiss, keeps toweling her hair in the mirror
He hugs her from behind, buries his face in her neck
Drained
Shit day
Shit day
Better now
(pause) How's she doing
Fine
She drove me a little crazy today
She was busy
In overdrive
Here
Feel
He reaches around, slowly unties her robe, pulls it open
revealing her pregnant belly
(Our angles have avoided this till now
) He places his hand, feeling for movement
Of course she stops kicking the moment you get home

had to say some things to a man today  didn't want to say
And did something  didn't want to do
You didn't lie to him
Or bullshit him
Or shine him on
None of those things
So you had your reasons
You did what you had to
It's not your fault the world sucks
Nick smiles, eases his face to her belly
You in there
Listen up
Your mother just said the world sucks
You may wanna rethink this whole thing
My advice
If you're asking
Just stay in there
promise you, nothing will ever make as much sense as it does right now
What is wrong with you
plus there's shit you don't need to know about
Rap
Internet porn
Madonna's entire back catalog
Did someone drop you on your head
Seriously
have swollen ankles and all  do is pee
That baby's coming out
(weighs that) Okay
'm sure you heard that
Then again there are the Beatles
70's funk
Louie
Ella
Be a shame to miss those
(beat, getting serious) All right, kid
Bring it on
But when you're old enough for the world to disappoint you,  hope you won't blame your old man for bringing you into this mess
Give me that at least

, their 10 year- old daughter
She darts in, puts her face to Nick's

Huh
Wha--
You know what it is
What

She jumps up on the bed, bouncing up and down and dancing around, hollering at the top of her lungs: '  , '  , '
Nick and Kell are too groggy to do anything but ride it out
Emma sails off the bed and vanishes out the door, hollering all the way up the hallway: '   '
Nick and Kell are left groping with blankets, heart rates, and consciousness: Glad it's once a year

It's a work thing
Grownup stuff
You know that happens sometimes

But it's

Tonight is all about your friends

Okay
But what are you doing tonight that is more important than
She's doing that "sneakily drawing close" thing again
Nick holds up his finger, cautioning her to say it quietly

Something he'd get out of if he could

She looks miserable wearing a big cone-shaped -
How long she have to wear this stupid thing

Yes, you are

All Rupert can do is lay there and watch, as: swab his arms with alcohol, prepare the needles, find his veins
The needles are inserted, taped off
The

Very methodical

Rupert Ames
Do you have anything to say
Rupert doesn't have much of an  and he's scared shitless, but he does his best: 'm here
Clarence Darby ain't
And that ain't right
'Cause that man is evil, ain't no other way to say it
All them things he done, and him turn witness against me for it
He pauses, trying to untangle his thoughts
did wrong too
guess 'll pay up
But it was always him sayin' jump and how high, and  just went along
Now he's killin' me and he got you people to do it
And that's a shame
goddamn shame
And

Nick trades a look with Sarah
Cantrell is stoic
Warden Iger nods to   manning the , on which     in a vertical row are the main feature, filled with various clear liquids
There are two switches -- one a dummy, the other live (no way to know which is which)
The guards power up the machine
Lights activate on the board
Each man grabs a switch, waits
Nick watches the wall clock
It hits 7 o'clock
The warden         * nods and the guards flick their switches, quickly leaving the      * room
The warden follows them out, closes the door
We hear the pumps quietly activate
Rupert is taking shallow breaths, terrified

Rupert sags as the fast-acting barbiturate spreads through his veins
his breathing slows
his head drops back
he loses consciousness
depresses, sending the second vial of liquid into the
lines with a quiet whir of pumps

then
the row of cylinders emptying in sequence
Rupert lies unconscious, just drifting away
He suddenly comes to
He draws in a long, shaky breath
It catches in his throat
His eyes go wide
His entire body starts to clench against some increasing pain
Nick is surprised, uncertain
Betsy starts   at     * Cantrell's side
Her head comes up, hackles rising
* Nick glances to the dog
then to Iger, sees the stunned look on the warden's face
Something is definitely wrong
The pumps keep whirring, the plungers keep descending
Rupert he throws his head back, mouth wide
Ah
ah
The witnesses go tense, confused -- what the hell
Ah--ah--Jesus, don't that
Rupert looks down at his arms, his expression turning to sheer horror, because: The veins are turning angry red, then blackening, as the liquids course through them
,  ,
Those are last coherent words he speaks
From then on, he's just shrieking and bouncing against his straps, because: His veins are starting to smoke
Noxious and foul
The flesh starts giving away, blood eating though skin like acid
Shock sweeps the onlookers: Oh, Jesus
What's going on
Nick
People are on their feet
Horror and incomprehension
Nick, goddamn it, what
don't know
Rupert is fast becoming a horror: -   9-19-08                                       17
It's going down his arms and legs, up his neck, infusing his ears -- a nauseating discoloration courses through his body, using his veins as a road map, going from red to yellow to black like bruises birthing spontaneously before our eyes
People in the room scream, turning away
Nick pushes his way to the viewing glass, shouting at the techs: ' The techs dash into the chamber -- but are instantly gagging      * and choking on the toxic fumes billowing from Rupert
They        * retreat coughing, pulling the door shut again
* Rupert's screams spew forth toxic fumes
breath blows smoke from his nostrils
eyes liquefy
he's arching against his restraints so hard that bones begin snapping, blood spewing and smoking through his skin
All Nick can do is stand at the glass in horror as whatever is happening runs its course and the victim collapses in a cloudy, toxic haze

Intense: We're still trying to sort through this thing
Gentlemen, we face a terrible shitstorm of scrutiny in the days to come
We need answers
Start with what we know
Lethal injection is a series of drugs given in a specific order
Somebody had to have replaced one or more of those ingredients with something else

Signal was probably jammed

He commuted Rupert Ames' sentence
They were trying to call us to stop the execution
They couldn't get through
Nick and Cantrell are stunned as this sinks in
The Governor's incoming number triggered this device and shut out any further calls
Cantrell removes his glasses, rubs his eyes
Softly: Oh, fuck me
Fuck me

Jesus, look at this
No wonder Bernstein loves him
We scored a lot of good intel off this fuckhead through the years
Almost a shame to bag the guy

The cops glance back

He's helped us put a lot of bad people behind bars

Arrests, convictions

So you cops look the other way
He gets a free pass as long as he keeps feeding you convictions
Isn't that what you did ten years ago
Give this guy a free pass in return for a conviction

Suddenly, the     above
Darby dashes for cover against a garage, lost in shadow
massively bright searchlight sweeps from above, probing
Darby crouches, heart hammering, watching the searchlight scan over rooftops
His phone , he answers: Ditch the gun
Wipe the prints
Kiss my ass

Revolver
Bring extra ammo
Darby glances at the gun, realizing
He bangs his head back against the garage wall in frustration -- fuck
You shot at cops
That's attempted murder if they find the gun on you
You're in deep enough without that
Darby frantically wipes the gun with his shirttail, as: You'll need my help getting out
What'll it cost me
We'll discuss terms later
Go south, across 10th
Past the El tracks

Darby shoves him stumbling into the ditch
The cop sinks to his knees and starts to weep
'll never see my wife and little girl again
'll never see them
It's fucked up
Darby steps closer, draws the hammer back, takes aim for a head shot
but his
He pulls it fast
This my guardian angel
(beat) Hello
On his knees in the muck, the cop's quiet weeping becomes soft laughter
He brings up a cell phone, speaks into it: see you got out okay
Darby draws back, confused, gun still aimed
The cop snaps his cell phone shut, rises to face him
You know why 'll never see my wife and daughter again
He takes his hat off, peels his moustache away
Darby pins him with the flashlight, finally and fully revealing: You took them from me
Recognition floods Darby
He pulls the trigger, and: -   9-19-08                                    27

Can't speak

Tetrototoxin
Fascinating stuff
It paralyzes you, but leaves all other neurological functions intact

He sets the gun down, starts rooting through some instruments that Darby can't see (though he's straining to)
That means you can't move
Or talk
But you can see
Hear
Feel
(busying himself) That last one's important
Feel
You can feel everything
(glances at bottled drugs) Got some other items here
Drugs to revive you in case you pass out
Stuff like that
Darby almost manages to speak, thrashing weakly
Clyde leans over, checks his pupils again
Wearing off a little
No worries
He tucks a padded block under Darby's head like a pillow, raising his head so he can see better
Clyde moves down the table, tightens straps holding Darby down
But the worst part: are tied on Darby's arms and legs at various points
Darby sees them and starts hyperventilating
Oh
These
Don't want you bleeding out
This will take a while
Clyde puts on a thick coat, like a meat-packer's
He returns, sorting implements, Darby trying to see
Clyde obliges him, holding things up: (pliers) Teeth
(hacksaw) Balls
(bolt cutter) Fingers
Maybe toes
(scalpel) Eyelids
In case you insist on shutting your eyes
Darby's screaming -- but with the tetrototoxin in his system, all that's coming out is air, like a slow leak
Clyde picks up an object, unfolds it -- a full-body plastic coat
He puts it on over his other coat, as: Earlier on the phone
said 'd get you out
You asked me what it would cost
Well

* We'll start with an arm and a leg
Go from there
Pause
The reality of what he's about to do washing over him:     * 've been waiting to say that line                    * for years
But it wasn't very funny, was it
No
Played much better in my head
Maybe it's my delivery
He puts a construction-site face protector atop his head, the kind with a full plastic face shield that can be flipped down

Emma looks perplexed
It's not a normal  -- more like a bad home movie: figure in a plastic coat and face shield turns from the camera to a table, where another man is strapped down
The first man raises a circular saw
The man on the table is thrashing weakly, trying to move
Emma still has no idea what she's looking at
Suddenly: The man with the saw makes a quick sweep across the table, across the other man's leg at the shin
The move was so fast and casual that it's taking a moment to sink in: Emma stands frozen, clutching her cereal bowl

On screen, the man with the saw picks up the severed limb and shows it to the victim
It's been lopped off below the knee

Nick and Kell enter behind her, confused, not sure what they're seeing

Nick glances over and sees a perfect 1965 midnight-blue Lincoln Continental in the carport

Dunnigan faces Clyde
Benson Clyde
You have the right to remain silent
as the full Miranda is read, Nick and Clyde have their eyes locked throughout -- this moment is all about them
understand your rights as  have explained them
Yes
Clyde is hustled outside, leaving Nick with Dunnigan and Garza in the farmhouse -- it's renovated, clean, very loft-like
Nick drifts to the table, sees the chess board, can't help admiring the pieces
Then his eyes go to a floor-to-ceiling bookcase
He's stunned to realize: they're all law books
(
) Check this shit out
Nick turns, moves to Garza's side
Dunnigan joins them
All three staring at a wall
around to reveal: The long-ago  (clipped from a newspaper) of Nick and Clarence Darby shaking hands on the courthouse steps
to reveal: Photo after photo
The crime scene photos
photos of Clyde and his family in happier times
photos clipped from magazines and newspapers about the murder and trial
all very neatly and precisely arrayed
The entire wall covered with them
from the record player
Dunnigan turns     * and yells: ,
64
-                               64 Clyde sits alone and isolated in a small room
to reveal Sarah at the observation glass
She turns as Nick steps up
He says he'll only talk to you
-    9-7-8                                         37
Nick and Dunnigan prepare to go in
Dunnigan takes off his gun and holster, lays them on a table, as Garza activates the Cantrell finds a chair by feel, sits down, as: Nick and Dunnigan enter
Dunnigan melts into a corner to observe as Nick sits across the table from Clyde
Counselor
Mr
Clyde
Why so formal
We go way back
Call me Benson
Or Ben
Nick sits across the table from Clyde, settles in
Well
'm here
So
So
Maybe you can explain what this is all about
Nick almost laughs -- not what he expected to hear
think that's obvious
Clyde spreads his hands questioningly -- not really
You murdered two people
Rupert Ames and Clarence Darby
(shifts his gaze) Detective
Dunnigan
Dunnigan
thought 'd made it clear  would only speak to the gentleman across the table from me
Dunnigan glowers at him, looks to Nick
You murdered two people
Rupert Ames and Clarence Darby
-     9-19-08                                  38
Darby
knew about Ames, of course
've been following the news about his horribly botched execution
But Darby too
Quite a coincidence
Cut the shit
We know you did it
Save everybody a lot of time and trouble and just confess
Are you going to continue to insist on being part of this conversation
Yes
(beat, gives in) Fine
Far be it from me to be rude
Clarence Darby was found on your property
Old abandoned shed
* didn't know  had one
It's 150 acres, uncultivated
The other day found a creek  never knew  had
Hunters trespass all the time
You going to try to pin the dead deer on me too
don't believe this guy
That man is frosty
* It occurs to me that an even moderately clever person could try to frame me for the murder simply by killing him on my property
One of Darby's drug rivals
That's an unsavory world
(off Nick's stare) jury would have to weigh that possibility
What else you got
-   9-19-08                                       39
(temper flaring) How about video of you dismembering Darby while he was still alive
That's odd
See, if  were to do such a thing, 'd probably wear something so  couldn't be identified
Some kind of mask maybe
But you say it's actually me on the video
Did the camera capture my good side
* Nick snaps, lunges across the table, grabs Clyde
You sick fuck, you sent it to my house
My daughter saw that video
It fucking traumatized her
She couldn't stop sobbing
Dunnigan moves in fast, trying to pull Nick off (but failing): Whoa-whoa, Nick, ease off
No trouble here, Detective, we're fine
Thank you, though
Dunnigan backs off
Clyde turns back to Nick, who's still got him in his grasp, their faces close
Your daughter is, what, ten now
That's a wonderful age
My daughter was always so busy at that age, so interested, so into everything
Jumping around
called her "Bean," she jumped around so much
Nick is easing off by inches, subtly and ineffably weirded- out, unable to break Clyde's gaze
Softly: am sorry, Nick, that your daughter experienced that
You're right
That video should not have arrived that way
The person who sent it should have thought twice
Dunnigan moves in again, gently but firmly pulls Nick away
Okay, enough
-   9-7-8                                   40
Unless there's hard evidence tying me to these crimes -- forensic or otherwise -- why am  here
Why are we having this conversation
We know you did it
It's not about what you know
It's about what you can prove in court
(off Nick's look) Your words
Like when you called it a justice system
You know the thing about a system, Nick
Any system can be played
You think you can play us
You gonna take me on
Clarence Darby did
And 'm much smarter than he was
Or you
Nick advances, furious, held back by Dunnigan: 'm gonna bury you, fucker
(lunges to his feet) That's it, that's what  want
That fire in the belly
That's what wanted ten years ago
Do it, Nick
Bury me
(shouting at Clyde) Sit down
Sit the fuck down
Clyde does, settles in, speaking calmly: Or
Set me free
What
Did  stutter
Make your case
Or
Shake my hand on the courthouse steps and send me on my way
(off Nick's look) 'll even make it easy on you will confess, how's that
-   9-19-08                                  41
You're gonna confess
Let's start tomorrow after a good night's sleep
We'll all be fresh and rested
65
-                             65 Nick paces agitated, with the group:                        * * Ten years he's been planning this
* Patient people make me nervous
This
This freaks me out
* * Is he serious about confessing
* What's his deal, is he crazy
Confession or not, we're gonna nail him on two counts of first-degree
Agreed, but softly
Nothing hard- ass, no grand-standing
Kid gloves
Kid gloves
He's a psycho with a power saw
Depending on who's writing the headline, he's a grieving husband and father who got revenge on the men who murdered his wife and child
(off Nick's look) Public sympathy is to be respected and feared
This could blow up in our faces if we're not careful
We can't look like we're pissed off or have an ax to grind
(stops) Are we pissed off
Do we have an ax to grind
No
-   9-19-08                                          42
Then stop acting like it
Beat
Nick takes a deep breath
Okay
He got under my skin a little
That's done
66
-                                               66 : We're following Nick and Sarah through one of the pedestrian tunnels to the street: background check's gotta be thorough,  want to know everything there is to know about this son of a bitch
Get all the ADAs on it, tell 'em  better not see them sitting around on their asses or texting their pals
How about outside help
That
who helped us on the Jacovitz case
Yeah, he was good
And Hanson's                        * always reliable
But try to limit their hours, okay
We find a  at the curb -- Kell at the wheel, Emma in back
Nick gets in
Sarah leans down, happy to see them
Emma's face lights up -- the little girl obviously adores her
Well, hello there beauty
Hey Kell
Hey Emma, how's my dynamo
Hi, Sarah
We haven't seen you in so long it's ridiculous
When are you gonna come by for a visit
Who needs a life, right
Talk to your husband, maybe he'll give us a day off one of these years
Soon, huh
Seriously, we miss you
-   9-19-08                                       43
Sarah blows Emma a big extravagant kiss
Emma returns it, waves as they pull away
Nick and Kell glance back, happy to see their daughter acting a bit more like her old self
67
'  -                                        67 Late
Nick, in t-shirt and pajama bottoms, comes up a dark hallway with a file in his hand, rubbing his eyes
He comes to his daughter's bedroom door, quietly turns the knob
' and finds the bed empty
Sheets thrown back
Nick stands for a moment, every irrational fear he's ever had washing over him
fast down the hallway
into the master bedroom, where he finds Emma sleeping with Kell
He stands for a moment, heart hammering
Softly: Fuck
Kell stirs, sees him, puts a finger to her lips
In whispers: saw her bed empty
Scared the shit out of me
Don't know why
She had a bad dream
She wanted to sleep with us tonight
(feels his heart race) Jesus
(stirs) Daddy
He climbs onto the bed, cuddles up, Emma between them
had a nightmare
That man
* know
Shhh
We're all good
You're safe
Nobody's gonna hurt you
Especially not that man
Daddy's gonna put him in jail forever
That's what daddy does
He makes sure the bad people stay locked away
Nick lays there, listening
-   9-19-08                                    44

" " -                                             69* huge domed chamber
In the center of the floor stands a smaller free-standing domed cage, like a bizarre birdcage
Inside the birdcage: Nick and Garza wait
Garza mans a camera
Outside the birdcage: Observers
Some (Cantrell and Sarah) occupy floor-level, where the video monitors are
Others (Iger and Dunnigan) are on a catwalk above that encircles the room
door opens and Clyde is brought into the birdcage
He gazes around, checking his surroundings
admit  expected something more modern
That jail downtown
* Filled to capacity
It has been for years
They had to re-open this for the overflow
Part of it anyway
* Welcome to the county jail annex
* All new inmates come here
It was                  * in the papers
Right
Prison crowding
It's a problem
He sits
Nick joins him, pulls out a legal pad
For the record: You've waived legal counsel
You've offered to confess to the murders of Clarence Darby and Rupert Ames
Yes
We'll get to that
First, what 'd really like to talk about is the cot in my cell
It's lumpy
(off Nick's stare) Hardly any padding
Steel springs
Very uncomfortable
-   9-19-08                                       45
know what lumpy means
Sorry to hear it
But we're not here to talk about prison conditions, we're here to talk about things you've done
Start with things  haven't done
Like get any sleep last night
(beat, leans forward) said let's begin today fresh and                * rested
You recall my words
* * What do you want from me
bed in my cell
bed
In your cell
Yes, please
One of those Sleep- Matic adjustables
Those are best
* You want the variable temperature control too
That would be nice
Beat
Nick tosses his legal pad on the table, swivels around in his chair to the observers up on the catwalk, spreads his arms in a "help me" gesture
Anybody
It's a steel cot
It's bolted to                  * the wall
* -   9-19-08                                   46
'm sure they have a wrench
* We also have rules prohibiting                  * personal items such as beds
* (looks to Nick) Let me get this straight
You're going to let a bed prevent this confession from taking place
You looking to deal
All right, how's this
How about  don't kick your fucking teeth down your throat
Clyde is mildly taken aback
The cops tense up
Nick
Sorry, Jonas
Okay, kid gloves
(to Clyde) My daughter slept in our bed last night
She hasn't done that since she was six
You gave her nightmares
So excuse me if  don't feel like cutting any little deals today
My daughter can't have nightmares, because she died with Clarence                  * Darby's breath in her face
You                 * gave him a reduced sentence and his             * freedom
All  want is a good night's sleep
70
-                                 70 Everybody's wound up, talking fast: This is bullshit
He's jerking our chain big-time
can justify the expense
* It's not just a bed
Every inmate               * here will be on the phone to their              * lawyer filing lawsuits for equal treatment
Can you justify that
* -   9-19-08                                       47
* (offering) We give him a bed, he confesses, we                  * take the bed away
At most it's one                  * night
* Cantrell weighs it, decides: We're talking a high-profile double homicide
Order the bed

Clyde's cellmate, a towering Aryan Brother named  , stands quietly amazed

) (pre-lap) Switching the drugs was easy

" " -                                            72 Back in the birdcage: hacked the Fedex database, diverted the package to me, made the switch, sent the package on
It's automated tracking numbers moving millions of packages daily
Nobody's questioning who receives what, or why
And the prison phones
Get a phone company uniform, hack the prison database, schedule an official visit
They'll wave you through the gate, like they did me
It's simple if you know how things work
(off Nick's look) It's a system
You learn how it works
You play it
Any system
-   9-19-08                                       48
(beat) saw him die
That stuff burned his veins
He suffered terribly
Score
Nick flips to a new page on his pad
Let's move on to Clarence Darby
(sits back)                                   * Hey, you like music
(hesitates)                                   * Very much
Why
* could tell
love music
All of                   * it
It's like air in my lungs
So the thing about Clarence Darby is, want my record collection and player brought to me
The vinyl discs as well as CDs
Reactions all around the room
Iger leans forward: Vinyl records and CDs can be broken into shards
They make excellent weapons
My answer to that one, Mr
Clyde, is not no, but hell no
* Clyde absorbs that, looks to Nick, as: It's a legitimate concern
(beat, calls to Iger) How about my ipod and speaker dock

plugs it in via a long orange extension cord
to Iger, who turns to the bars and hands a remote control through to Clyde
Dixon's watching balefully, as is every inmate on the cellblock
-   9-7-8                                        49
The player stays out here
You hand the remote to the on-duty guard every night at lights out
Those terms aren't negotiable
appreciate your compromise
Iger draws close to the bars
Quietly: You looking to get your ass kicked
(off Clyde's look) By every inmate on this cellblock
You keep this up, they'll take it out on you
Harshly
Clyde glances back to Dwight
Dwight's watching, glowering, agreement in his silence
Clyde turns back to Iger
Just trying to keep you alive in here
That's all
Iger walks away
Clyde aims the remote
He leans his head on the bars, listening, blissed
Cons all over the cellblock are staring daggers at him
(
) (pre-lap) took his fingers with a bolt cutter
His toes with a pair of tin snips
His balls with a hacksaw

" " -                                            74 his penis with a box cutter
His skin with a filet knife
His teeth with pliers
His eyes
for those used my fingers
(looks to Nick) Check the video  made
All that will match up
kept him alive for an hour, give or take
Time it
Nick trades looks with the others in the room -- everybody have what they need
People nod
Nicks closes his pad
What now
My office types it up, you sign
-   9-19-08                                       50
Nick rises, putting things in his briefcase
People get ready to leave -- but Clyde motions Garza to keep it rolling
How about a signing bonus
The small concessions you've made so far have kept my cooperation flowing
why not give me a reward for signing
You don't want to sign, don't sign
We've got you on videotape, we'll go to trial
In ten years, when your appeals are exhausted, 'll attend your execution
'll make sure nobody tampers with the drugs
Don't be such a hard-ass, Nick don't want much
Just a good meal
(directed at Iger) The food here
Sucks
No offense
Dunnigan glances at Nick and stifles a smile, enjoying where this is going in spite of himself: What do you have in mind
There's a place in town on Halston
La Traviata
Ever been
* It's a little above my pay grade
You know it, don't you, Nick
* 've eaten there
So
* They cater
Tonight, at 7 p
m
,                   * would like my meal delivered to my cell from La Traviata
With nice silverware, crisp linens
Not gonna happen
Why not
-   9-19-08                                          51
Because  have no interest in making it happen
And you have nothing left to bargain with
'mon, Nick
We've just started bargaining
You haven't even heard what 'm offering yet
This makes people pause
Something in the tone of his voice
Miss Lowell
Is your laptop still on
Would you please do a search
She flips the laptop opens, dread mounting even though she's not sure why, poises her fingers over the keys
William
Baxter
Reynolds
Cantrell's quietly stunned as the name sinks in
Pin-drop silence now
Laptop keys
People frozen
Who's William Reynolds
Clarence Darby's defense attorney
He brokered the testimony deal with us ten years ago
He's been missing now since
March of '06
Sarah spins the laptop -- a photo of Reynolds, a story of his disappearance
* Detectives Dunnigan and Garza will like this offer, Nick
It'll clear one of their department's missing- persons files
And it'll solve them their third homicide this week
Tell me
How do you think  located Clarence Darby after he got out of jail and legally changed his name
Reynolds told me -- though it took some                       * convincing

to Iger overseeing this process, passing china and utensils to the waiter, who's flustered: You're bruising the crepes
Life's a bitch, then you die
no plates, they break into nice jagged pieces
nothing sharp, nothing that can be made sharp
no forks, no knives, no spoons
lose that carafe
we will have no potential weapons of any kind this evening, thank you
you can eat with your fingers
The guards will think me gauche
Clyde's got the rose, teasing his nose with it

(calls after her) Thanks
Keep digging

Softly: Idiot
Then he too departs, as: aims his remote

Make me squeal like a piggy
That sort of thing
Fuckin'
Clyde motions "join me, won't you
" They each take a seat
Clyde passes Dwight a crisply-folded linen napkin
Dwight tucks it like a bib
Clyde lays his on his lap
hurled object  off their bars
The cons are now throwing things, hollering to raise the dead
Clyde cranks the music a bit louder, motions for Dwight to dig in
Dwight goes for it, cramming food in his mouth and grabbing for more, fingers digging in

Oddly enough, he and Clyde seem to have started enjoying each other's company
in bizarre counterpoint to:                * of an angry cellblock -- if the cons weren't in their cells, this would be a riot
All imaginable items are being hurled through bars: toilet paper rolls, books, shoes, clothes, all raining down, showering the cellblock floor

Dwight throws his head back and laughs
93
-                                                 93 while, in deep silence, Nick unwraps a sorry-looking deli sandwich, swaps his pickles for Cantrell's potato salad (their long-standing ritual)
They both keep glancing at the phone
94

Dialogue is not important, so we won't hear any -- we'll let the          * take over and carry -- because it's all about tone: They're laughing and talking, winding each other up
And the more Clyde wisecracks, the more Dwight laughs
Clyde finishes gnawing a lamb rack and says something to Dwight about the ruckus
Dwight turns, glances out, as: Clyde casually, but with purpose, lowers the bone onto his lap -- adding it to one already there
He picks up a fresh one, starts chewing the meat off
95

Forensic team members gather, in gloves and breather masks, getting ready to try lifting
Okay, let's see if we can get him out in one piece
Davies at the helicopter, activity around him, holding Nick's card and dialing a cell phone

He unwraps the napkin from his hand, snaps it open, uses it to wipe the blood from his face
He takes his seat, positions the cart, uncovers the crepes and resumes eating

Flanking him are Cantrell, Dunnigan, Davies (banged up and bandaged), Iger, others
They move toward us with purpose, grim and resolute, Sarah bringing up the rear with a young  named
Why do you have him in the dome
He killed his cellmate
We had to separate him out
What's wrong with solitary
We don't have the authority
Not without a court order
This place was re-opened under protest as it is
Some areas are off-limits to our use -- tied up in a legal challenge by the  as cruel and unusual
Especially solitary
(off Nick's look) It was nicknamed the dungeon

Nice trick with the rack of lamb
Didn't see that one coming
Why'd you kill your cellmate
claim self-defense
Here's what  think
You suckered us in
You ordered that meal for the purpose of killing him
Which makes it premeditated
Again
And, again, you'll have to prove that in court
As 've said before
(to Nick) make your case
Or set me free
(pissed, moving forward) Your booby-trap killed two of mine            * and put four in the hospital
That            * brings the total of people you've             * killed to six -- and be advised the           * Bureau does not suffer losing agents in the field
(turns) We're done dancing
have the right to claim jurisdiction here, do not, Detective Dunnigan
That is correct, Agent Davies
(again to Clyde) So
'm gonna rendition your ass
Rumor has it we have places that make Guantanamo look like Disneyland
Don't bother packing, you're gonna disappear
(beat, glances to Nick) You see, Nick
That man is pissed
That's what 'm talking about
No deals, no compromise
You see
see you totally disconnected from reality, that's what  see

Not likely
In fact, you just bought a one room suite in the dungeon
Very exclusive
You'll have it all to yourself -- the first man down there in over twenty years
Quite an achievement
Clyde sinks with a sigh of resignation and defeat, rests his head wearily on the bars
Nick moves in, speaking quietly: You're doing everything wrong
Making all the wrong moves
It would seem that way
The wording catches Nick -- but he dismisses it, turns: Sam

But 'd like my shot at prosecuting this case

It's been exactly that since  watched him shake Clarence Darby's hand on the steps of the Hall of Justice ten years ago
The Hall of Justice
His voice echoes off
In the silence that follows: You wanna take this fuck down
Be my guest
Whatever you need
(bangs his bars) That's the spirit, yes
(to Nick) It's on you now, Nick
It's your game to lose
Just don't screw up
You do, they'll scapegoat you
That's         * how the justice system works

Making me disappear was a bad idea
You couldn't have handled the blowback
Blowback

Your actions                * provoke reactions

is spraying -40 into the lock of a cell, trying to turn the key
It finally does, as: Clyde is brought in
have him on poles connected to a leather collar around his neck, and they're none too gentle
Clyde tosses a final glance back at Nick and Iger
* Clock's running, Nick

-                                        110 Nick and the others exit the Dome, thoughts racing: What can he do
We've got him boxed in
He's isolated, for God's sake
Let's keep him that way
Strict rules apply
Law says he gets one hour outside his cell a day, that's what he gets
Just one, under heavy guard
The other twenty-three hours, he's in that cell, he's a ghost, he doesn't exist
No contact whatsoever
You think it was a bluff
* We underestimated him before
'd like to know what this prick is capable of
(calls to Sarah) Update on the background check
Properties, investments, a few small                   * businesses he owns -- a lot of it's                    * hidden behind false names and shell                    * companies, but we're still digging
* That's it
Nothing else unusual
* The last twenty years, he's been                       * Joe Blow Citizen
But prior to that,                   * we've hit a blank spot

What kind of government work leaves a blank spot, Sam
'll make a few discreet calls
See what  can find out

We find Nick and Kell at a table
She's got her menu, but her attention's really on Nick
He's toying absently with his wine glass
Where are you
(catches himself) Million miles away
Sorry
Don't be
This guy's really doing a number on your head, isn't he
Yeah
guess he is
(she expects more) It's
killing his cellmate
need that to make sense
Why
Happens in prison all the time
Yeah,  know, but
we're not talking some gang-banger
This man is precise
Does things for a reason
He's psycho
You said so yourself
We saw it on that video
Psychos don't need a reason, Nick
They're just psycho
(off his look) Whatever
You'll figure it out
You                  * always do

It's called inter-agency cooperation, but don't ask me what agency because  wouldn't know

Which one of you is Davies
Davies takes a step forward
eases partially into the light -- flinty gaze, military-style haircut
You must be well thought of, Agent Davies
don't do this
But  was asked nicely by the right people
They briefed me on your problems with Benson Clyde
What are we dealing with
Things  can neither confirm nor deny
Things of which, if 'm asked, will disavow any knowledge
The guys trade a look
Cantrell can't help chuckling
(to Davies) You gotta be kidding me with this guy
He's not
Tell me you grasp the implication of what 've said, or we're done here

Okay

What was Clyde
Some kind of spy
Spooks like me are a dime a dozen
Clyde was a brain
He ran a think- tank, inventing things for use in the field
Ways to kill people
(off their looks) You need to get rid of somebody
It's not a situation where you can get close
What do you do
Ask Clyde
That's right
Ask Clyde
And he'd figure something out
Gizmos, strategy
He was good at it
How good
(beat) You play chess
Yeah
Tournament level in college, matter of fact
In my line, we use an aptitude profile based on chess
tournament- level player like you can think five to eight steps ahead of an average player, did you know that
Me,  think about ten steps ahead, so 'd take you in a game
What about Clyde
Off the charts
If you're eight steps ahead, he's twenty
Or fifty
He's already got the game won on the first move, you don't even know you're playing yet
(further into the light) This cellmate he killed
You think that was random
Bullshit
That was a pawn taken off the board
If were you, 'd be trying to figure out what the move was

have been
Any thoughts
Top of my head
Was the cellmate ever connected with this case
Or with Clyde
Was anybody else in that facility
Guards
Cons
The janitor
Any connection at all, no matter how remote
Because if Clyde says he has things in play, he does
Like what
He's locked up
What can he do
(gives him a look) You're an average chess player, aren't you
Actually,  kind of suck
can tell
But  like your tie
(perplexed) Thank you
Father's Day
There's this tie -- we call it the Albert, after Albert DeSalvo
They tiptoe in one night, thread a piano wire with a ratchet gizmo into one of your ties
Sounds crazy, but                     * trust me it works
You put your tie                 * on and all day long it slowly tightens
You don't even notice it's cutting off the blood-flow to your brain
Then you drop dead
Brain-dead or plain dead, doesn't much matter at that point
(beat) Clyde invented that
The Spook melts back into the shadows
The guys crane forward, trying to see
There's a brief spill of light below as a doorway opens and closes
he's gone
The three of them stand there absorbing everything they've heard
Nick sits on a step
Quiet looks are traded

Kell and Emma are in the living room playing Scrabble
Daddy
Emma jumps up and runs over for a hug
Mom said  could stay up late
Wanna play Scrabble
Let me talk to mom first
Emma returns to the couch
Kell comes to Nick, noticing his weird vibe: he's looking around at the room
Sorry about date night
It's fine
You learn anything
Thing or two
He moves up the hallway -- slowly, as if noticing the walls for the first time, the picture frames, the light fixtures
(following him) Nick
Hey,  was thinking
Maybe you could pack an overnight bag for you and Emma in case you need to
you know
spend the night in a hotel
Or something
Why would we wanna do that
No reason
It's like a fire-drill thing
You know
In case

He stares at the ties hanging in neat rows
starts touching them, running his hands up and down the fabric
-   9-19-08                                        70
Kell stands in the doorway watching
Wondering what the fuck is going on
And getting a little creeped out
Honey
He freezes, feeling something in the seam of a tie
Runs his fingers up and down, thinking something's in there
Emma appears in the doorway too, at her mother's side
Both staring now
They watch as: Nick grabs a pair of scissors from Kell's sewing kit, carves the tie lengthwise, rips it open, feverish and faster, finds nothing inside but mangled fabric and thread and -- stops
Looks back
Realizes they're staring at him
What the hell are you doing
Nick pauses -- what the hell is he doing
He starts to regain his sense, laughs at himself in amazement
Daddy
It's okay, baby -- 'm fine, promise
Go back to your game
Dubious, Emma departs
As soon as she's out of earshot: Seriously, Nick
What the fuck
Nothing
got paranoid for no reason, that's all
'm fine now can't believe  let that son of a bitch Clyde get to me like that

don't wanna hear any shit about it
(on Jameson again) Clack-clack, Jameson
Clack-clack
-   9-19-08                                          72
Jameson dives onto the keys, starts clack-clacking
Sarah gives Nick a nod -- she's got this in hand
Nick exits

-                                        119 and finds a   disassembling Clyde's Sleep-Matic bed -- nuts, bolts, struts, electronics
The mattress is being razored open, wadding pulled out and run under fluoroscopes
Well
It used to be a Sleep-Matic adjustable bed
Now it's not
them to a table where an   is focusing all their skills and tech on Clyde's ipod and speaker dock
The   places the buds in his ears, listening
What do you have
Rocky Mountain Way
Joe Walsh
(off Nick's look) What do you want from me, it's a fucking ipod
The other agents snicker, not hiding their amusement, but:         * * Tear it apart, make sure
Memory
* Speakers
Wiring
Everything
* 120
'  -                                     120 , , -  -- they're cruising the cellblocks, flashlights swiveling, beams catching the faces of sleepy cons in their cells or at their bars
We find Nick and Iger at Clyde's now-empty cell
* emerge, shake their heads
* Blood stain
Few fibers
That's it
(sleepy, at his bars) Warden, man, whassup
Everybody back to sleep
(looks to Iger) want to see him

- '  -                          121 Two doors: solid steel outer door, inner barred door
The outer slides aside, reveals Nick outside the bars
Inside stands a shadow, waiting: Clyde
You're up early
Trouble sleeping
It was a good bluff
But you're done
Fucking with my head
Scaring                    * my family half to death
Done
Clyde moves closer to the bars, into the light
Amazing, isn't it
How primal that is
That pull
What a man is capable of when it comes to his family
* * You strip away all the polite shit,                    * that's what we're really about
* hope you never face what it is to                    * lose them, Nick
It's like dying yourself
There's nothing worse
That could play as a threat, of course -- but it's not
It's       * genuine
And pained
And sincere
And Nick knows it
Good night, Ben
Good night, Nick
And then the moment's gone and the mocking Clyde returns: Is it casual Friday
(off Nick's look) 've never seen you not wear a tie
And that says volumes: Clyde's totally aware of what they've been up to and is tickled by it
The outer door
122
-                                         122 Night has passed, day is coming
All the earlier energy has dissipated into anticlimax and weariness
People straggle across the yard in groups toward their vehicles
-   9-19-08                                         74
Nick, Dunnigan, Davies, Iger -- all look whipped
Sarah approaches, briefcase in hand, files under her arm
We dug pretty deep for one night
Still got a ways to go, but on a first look
Nothing
Nada
Zip
Well, that's good news
So far
Now we double-down
Make                    * absolutely certain
* (nods after ADAs)                            * Let them all sleep a few hours,                     * then bring 'em back for round two
* Due diligence
My middle name
* She trudges toward her car, following the ADAs toward their vehicles
Nick trades relieved looks with the men -- everybody coming down from a tense night
Davies shakes their hands: Fellas
For once, glad not to be of assistance
Love it when they cry wolf
The men separate in different directions
Dunnigan catches a glimpse of Sarah almost at her car -- she loses a page from under her arm, which flutters away on the breeze
(calls to her) Miss Lowell
Lost something
She looks back, sees the page skittering slowly across the ground
Weary, she blows a strand of hair from her eyes, sets down her briefcase, walks back to get it
Dunnigan smiles, keeps walking
The other men too
Nick stands a moment, watching, then starts toward his car
The ADAs are getting to their cars, pulling key fobs, aiming them to unlock their cars
Sarah is getting to the page, leaning down
The ADAs are pressing the remotes, a
And  -- the cars  in a stunning , killing the ADAs, throwing bodies through the air, kicking cars off the ground and flipping a few skyward
-   9-19-08                                          75
Nick is knocked flat by heat and shrapnel ripping the air
Sarah goes flying
An arcing car slams upside-down nearby on a rocket-booster of flame and shattering axle
And from this point on the visuals and sound are surreal:          * pries himself off the ground, stunned, looking around, trying to figure out what the fuck just happened
He's disoriented, all sound muffled
Smoke drifting
Flames billowing
Dunnigan runs up to Nick, shouting something
We can't tell what, because Nick can't hear
Dunnigan sees Nick is alive, turns and keeps going, running to help the others
Nick looks over, sees bodies being pulled clear by responders, men running in, beating at flames
Nick, dazed, looks through the drifting smoke and sees Sarah trying to sit up
There's something wrong with her leg
Nick pulls himself to his knees, staggers to his feet as sound filters back in: screams, shouts, the roar of flames
He stumbles through the smoke to Sarah
She's on the ground in shock, sobbing and flailing, crying out
Nick sees the jagged piece of metal that slammed deep into her calf, nearly severing it
He drops to his knees, tries to calm her: You're gonna be all right
He pulls the metal from her leg -- mistake
Blood sprays
He clamps down hard with both hands, blood going everywhere
He keeps clamping down, Sarah screaming and sobbing, as we 123       --,   :              123 spraying the flaming rubble of the cars
billowing smoke
dragged across the ground, added to a awaiting transport
parked haphazardly, lights spinning

being wheeled on a gurney to a   by an , oxygen mask on her face, gravely injured but stabilized, everything swirling around her, Dunnigan clearing a path
appears, takes her hand
She clasps it weakly
They load her on and the vehicle pulls out with siren and lights
124
-                                         124 Back to "real time" -- Cantrell is just getting out of his town car with his dog
Nick on his cell: (on cell) Baby
Listen
Don't be worried or scared
But  want you to pack those overnight bags
don't have time to explain now
Just do it, okay
'll call you back as soon as  can -- please, honey,  gotta go
He clicks off as   , revealing Davies and his coming his way: Each car had an explosive charge on the gas tank
He's got someone working with him
On the outside
He's got to
Not necessarily
Everything looks pre-rigged
We found a short-range transmitter beacon buried outside the prison wall
When your people showed up here and drove in through the gate, the signal armed the bombs
* He could have planted those bombs a month ago
(grappling for sense) No
no, we've got two dozen ADAs on payroll
Those eight were picked last night on the spur of the moment
How could he know which eight would show up
-   9-7-8                                        77
He didn't
Our people just found bombs on every car in your  pool
All two dozen
We're disarming those now
125
" " -                                           125 shoved into the birdcage
The neck-poles are disengaged
He moves forward, gazing through the bars
want a phone in my cell
If 'm conducting my own defense, it would be useful
Also in case you and need to be in touch, Nick
Fuck you
(glances at clock) Your twenty four hours are about up
In return for the phone, 'll extend you another twelve hours
If not
How many more people die while you stand around dithering
How many do you get killed before my point starts sinking in
Cantrell closes in, tracking Clyde by voice: Motherfucker
Whatever point you had was lost long ago
Eight kids dead in that yard, most of them just out of college
Eight
have to talk to their families
have to try to explain why their loved ones are dead
Clyde leans down, right in Cantrell's face, intense: 've been waiting for my explanation for ten years
So far
(shouts) '
Beat
Cantrell spits in his face, turns away trembling with rage
Clyde calmly wipes it off, rises to address them all: -   9-19-08                                       78
If it hasn't dawned on you, this is a war
As in any war, there will be collateral damage
The question, as always, is how much damage you're willing to take before you withdraw
Maybe  got a better idea
Maybe we end this war right now
(looks around) Fourteen people dead
have to say                  * this out loud
(moving toward Clyde) Prisoners die in custody all the time
Attacking a guard
Trying to escape
Shit like that
Clyde, eyes locked, pulls his shirt open -- here's your target
Dunnigan, temper flaring, yanks his revolver and aims
Don't tempt me
Jesus Christ, man, dial it back
Do it
It would be decisive
Stupid, but decisive
(off Dunnigan's look) Can you handle the blowback, Detective
The "shit like that
" Nick's stunned, seeing the whole situation spiraling out of control
He steps in, seizing the moment back: Put the gun away
Are you crazy
(calmly reholsters) It's an option
All 'm saying
Risk the blowback
Ride it out
We're not risking anything
Or letting him tear us down
(to Clyde) You're not getting us to throw out the rules, like you
No way
-   9-19-08                                       79
like rules
've wanted you to follow them from the start
Like the one that says you prosecute a man who murders my family
(re-buttons) So
Rules
phone buys you another twelve hours
But if you haven't cut my deal and let me go by the deadline
What
What then
'll kill someone in this room
That sucks the air out of the conversation -- everybody stares as that sinks in
Glances are traded
Who
He looks at the room full of people, scans their faces as if trying to pick
He points his finger, starts going from one end of the group to the other
Eenie
meenie
miney
moe
from person to person, to the end, moving back again
my mother
told me
to pick
a person
and that
person
is
He lands on Cantrell
Silence
Cantrell obviously can't see
Who's he pointing at
126
-                                       126* Everybody on the move, emotions high: Fuck him
Let him try
That's not helpful
We have fourteen                  * dead
You could ask them what he's capable of, but they're in no position to answer
-   9-19-08                                 80
(beat, tight) Point taken
We'll give him his phone
We'll tap in and monitor every call
Buys us another twelve hours, we could use that right now
That puts the deadline at
(checks his watch) about 7:30 tonight
Shit
'll be in front of a room full of lawyers
The
dinner
'm the keynote speaker
No way
Find a replacement
Until his deadline passes, you're in protective custody
Not negotiable
Cantrell isn't happy about it -- but nods
And have them switch the location of that dinner
That's last minute
-   9-19-08                                       81
Exactly
He could have gotten your schedule in advance -- been planning to take you out at the dinner along with everybody else
That eenie- meenie act could have been horseshit
(off their looks) We have to get a few moves ahead
Plan for every contingency
This way, Mr
Cantrell
Garza, you're with Mr
Price
They split up
Dunnigan leads Cantrell to an unmarked car while Nick and Garza head toward Nick's
Nick's phone
He checks the number, answers: Hey baby -- no, 'm fine
Really
Honey, calm down
He listens a beat, calls to the men getting in the other cars: Our shit just hit the fan in a big way -- we're all over the news
(on phone) Yes, all eight died
Sarah's in surgery right now
(beat) they think so, but
(beat) okay, 'll meet you there
Love you
He hangs up, aims his key fob -- and hesitates
He and Garza trade a look, thinking the same thought
to: * You're good
Car's been swept
Of course it has
Thanks
Nick, feeling foolish, presses the fob
Nothing but a tiny He and Garza get in
127
() -                                  127 Dunnigan drives

are stationed in the hallway
Garza pushes a path through: Keep the press off this floor, understand
Nick squeezes past
The floor is busy
He finds Kell in the waiting area
She looks up, spots him
Kell rises
She and Nick pull into a tight embrace
No words for a long moment
Kell's shaken, fighting tears
Any word
She's in surgery now
They're saying she'll be okay
Thank God
That's good
Good
You'll have to explain the good part, Nick
'm missing it
This is crazy
What if something happened to you
What would  say to Emma
What would we do
You didn't lose me
You won't
Does the school know we're pulling Emma out of class
called, yeah, but -- 'd rather be here for Sarah when she wakes up
Nick -- and for you
want to do something
You are
Getting our daughter out of harm's way
And yourself
(calls to Garza) Detective
Will you escort my wife, please
(to Kell) There's not much time
'll be there to see you off
Okay
Please

Everybody's in shock, a few are crying
* details are sketchy at this point, and names are being withheld
People start noticing Nick
Royce comes up, looking dazed
Sarah's fine
That's the good news
Oh, God, that's a relief
(calls to the others) Miss Lowell is okay
she's okay
Everybody reacts -- they needed a shred of good news
We've been getting calls from upstairs
The mayor's people
(off Nick's look) Someone from our office has to make a statement to the press
With Mr
Cantrell absent, the mayor wants you to do it
-   9-7-8                                        84

don't know
four thousand
Give it to me
And your cell phone
need to borrow it for a few days

-                                          132 enters shot, pushes a door open into glaring daylight
him outside to a podium set up before a swarming shouting questions
to reveal: Royce, nervous, leaning to the microphones
We in the
's office are still reeling from the events of this morning, as you can imagine
It's a tragic day for us
for our city
133
-                                  133 Kell and Emma on the platform, Garza hovering nearby, swarming around them as boarding calls come over the
system
Kell is looking around, anxious
Nick appears on the platform, hurrying
They see him
Emma runs, throws herself into Nick's arms as he crouches
wanna see Sarah
Hey, hey
she's fine, don't be scared
That's not allowed
And there's no reason for it
This sucks
know
Why do we have to go
-   9-19-08                                       85
'Cause your mom wants to see a few Broadway shows
You gonna begrudge her that
You're kinda full of shit, Dad
Nick's taken aback -- not sure whether to laugh
He trades a look with Kell, who's too tense with worry to care
Okay, you're right
Maybe  am a little
But only a little
The part you can believe is that this is all going to be fine
Sarah, us
(directed at Kell) mean it
Okay
Okay
She detaches from her father
Nick rises to Kell, pulls an envelope, hands it to her
No credit cards
Too easy to track
Meals, hotel, whatever -- pay cash
then takes her cell, swaps it for Royce's
'll keep this
It can be traced
Use this one instead
Don't answer unless you see it's me
* ,
Anything else
love you
Emma's right
This sucks
She embraces him, fears and emotions swirling
Be goddamn careful
-   9-19-08                                          86
She breaks the embrace
Nick stands, watching them get on the train
The doors close
The train starts out
Nick turns
Garza's been watching -- a look of sympathy for what Nick's going through

Cantrell sits isolated, near tears of frustration, as the place is trashed around him
He glances up, hearing: Jesus
* Nick
These guys won't even let me pack a bag
Not even a toothbrush
Davies enters frame, accompanied by   -- not the guys from downtown, but people who work serious ops
We have granules of an unidentified substance in the ice-maker
He holds up a drinking glass with a few ice cubes, runs a black-light wand behind it -- dark granules become visible on each pass, embedded in the ice
'm betting something lethal
#1 Like this salt
(pours a small amount) Not sodium chloride
Potassium chloride
It's a neuro-blocker, stops the heart -- they use it in lethal injections
You'd be dead before you got up from the table

Nick tosses the others a grim look
* 'm telling you, Clyde has someone          * working with him
Someone on the outside
Who
Who could he have
Somebody from his past
Could be            * that spook we met on the stairs,            * for all we know -- he'd know how to         * plant this shit
Him
No--why would Clyde let him come talk to us
To fuck with our heads
To get us to bring in our ADAs so he could blow them up
* It would be a Clyde move
But it's          * not proof
(to Cantrell)                        * Could he have planted this stuff in         * your house before he was arrested
-- don't know
Jonas, think -- last few days, have         * you used any ice
Any salt
(confused, grappling) don't use salt--my cholesterol
Ice
Yeah--not long ago
Before or after he was arrested
don't remember

Looks like polonium here
In his tea pot
Same way the Russians killed Litvenenko
Took him two weeks to die
(off their looks) It's an exotic isotope
All you need is a trace amount
Rips through your organs and bone marrow
Nick's been listening, thunderstruck, paler by the moment
He looks to Cantrell sitting there, quiet and shaking
* 'll buy you a new toothbrush
* 137

They come into the room
actually, "room" undersells it
It's the most spectacular suite known to man -- huge open floor plan, with a stunning view of all the downtown buildings surrounding us
Holy shit
Nice
'm actually a little jealous Clyde didn't pick me
Cantrell laughs -- and it lightens everybody's mood
Nick          * drifts to the windows, gazing out, as:                             * It's the presidential suite
Last person who stayed here was actually a president
Of a country
Security here is amazing
* It's not bad, Jonas
think you can muddle through
You're muddling with him
don't want you back at your house until my people sweep it
You need pajamas, buy some in the shop downstairs
Nick nods, pulls Sarah's reports from his briefcase
-   9-19-08                                       89
The background check my office was compiling -- these properties we                    * think Clyde owns
If he is working                  * with somebody, they could be                        * operating out of any of these
We                   * should check them

Big job
* (pages the report)                           * No shit
This is quite a list
Over                 * forty locations
It's not even complete
Sarah was                   * in the middle of it -- untangling property ownership from under assumed names, shell companies
She's the expert on all that
* Fellas
'm grateful for all your efforts
just wanted to say it
Save it for tonight
Hope you're in the mood for Chinese takeout
Where are you going
That stuff in your house -- it's all gone too far
started this owe everybody at least one last try at defusing it

Clyde steps out, shackled, blinking at daylight
He comes down a short flight of steps
to reveal his surroundings: not within prison walls, but rather behind the prison -- a loading area we haven't seen, comprised of fences and razor wire
Nick walks in the rear gate, passed through by Warden Iger himself -- this is clearly an off-the-books meeting
Nick and Clyde walk to each other, meet halfway
-   9-7-8                                           90
Interesting location you've chosen
thought we'd have some privacy
For what
talk
Or
(gazes around) Maybe you've decided to take Detective Dunnigan's advice
He's noticing  atop the prison wall and surrounding roofs -- all with sniper rifles
Be the perfect place for it
Outside the wall
Look like you were shot trying to escape
Nick and Clyde below
suddenly rises into frame, turning our shot into a   , jumping Clyde's face into magnification
He smiles in the crosshairs
You have some kind of signal worked out
You scratch your nose and blam, 'm a goner
Something like that
Might solve all your problems
What's stopping you
Afraid of the blowback
No
It's to prove a     point
(off Clyde's     look) Just because  have     the power, doesn't mean  have     to use it
Ah
Nice
Good one
One can show mercy
Mercy
Right
Yeah
So why don't you
-   9-19-08                                       91
We see Clyde's brain bend a little -- trying to wrap his head around it
It's almost painful for him
think we've come a little too far for that, haven't we, Nick
mean, what do  say
Sorry, my bad
Which way to the execution chamber
Don't give me that
Death doesn't scare you
(smiles "right") Yeah, but
we're in the flow of this now
You cry havoc, you let slip the dogs of war, you go with                  * it
You don't just stop because                    * someone says hey wait
By then the dogs are dragging you
Until one side admits defeat
What if  did that
What if  said
(beat) you were right
was wrong
What if  say  should have prosecuted both men ten years ago
'd say you're making progress
You should have, you know
Prosecuted both
'd have lost
With your head held high
And without any blame from me
Nick's   -- he turns away, answers: Yeah
(beat) She is
Great news
'll stop on my way back
And Royce
Put some get- well flowers in her room, they sell 'em in the lobby
Thanks
(hangs up, baleful) Six hours in surgery
-   9-19-08                                  92
But she's okay -- good
Miss Lowell is a fine young woman
(beat) Oh, hey
your wife and little girl get out of town all right
(beat, staring) You asking that question makes me want to scratch my nose
Clyde glances around at the snipers with a laugh
Just a guess
It's what  would do
Get 'em out, make sure they're safe
(reproachful) 'mon
Like 'd ever have hurt them anyway
No
There are limits
Even in war may be many things, Nick
But 'm not Clarence Darby
'm not Rupert Ames
'm not that kind of monster
What kind are you
Not the kind who'd hurt your wife and child
Christ, look at me
Mine were my salvation -- then they were killed -- and all  had left was this
Life without them in this fucking charnel-house world
Pause
Drawing close: It hurt to lose them, didn't it
Your family
Even knowing they'd come back
Yeah
Imagine knowing they wouldn't
can't
can't imagine that
* -   9-19-08                                        93
Good
envy you
For me, knowing                     * mine won't come back is the only thing that's crowded my thoughts for ten years
If  could take a rusty knife and cut out that part of my brain,  would
won't make any more deals with murderers
If hearing that makes a difference
if that was the point of all this
you've won
We see Clyde's brain hurting again -- he's trying to believe that, would like to believe that
Counselor
have no doubt, as we stand here, that you really believe that
wish  could
(pause) Are we done
You gonna scratch your nose, or can  go
Silence now
Nothing left to say
They turn and walk in opposite directions

'   -                                   140 and Clyde is brought in, locked into gloom as the doors behind him
He stands, staring at the darkness

Laura, that you

'm sorry, Judge Burch is gone for the evening
Dang it
Listen, honey,  flew in from Galveston for this
thing Laura invited me to -- just got here and they said it was moved
You got a number, address, anything
145
-                                        145 Nick peers in
Sarah's in bed, leg braced, in traction
She's awake but groggy -- which isn't stopping her from giving instructions to Royce, who's scribbling notes at her bedside: tell Hansen we need hard info on those addresses
don't let the shell game on ownership title slow him down
at this point we'll take educated guesses
Sarah looks over, sees Nick step in, gives him a weak smile
Hey
Hey
Nice flowers
Thanks
He comes to the bed, takes her hand, squeezes it
How you doing
This place has great drugs
Damn should've totaled my leg long ago
But her emotions are in turmoil -- she puts her hands over her face, holding back a sob
They're all dead
'm afraid so
Sarah lets herself cry
Nick waits, then:                         * You're alive
That counts for a                      * lot

She absorbs that, angrily wipes her eyes
It wasn't you
It was that son of a bitch
hear he's threatened Jonas

He follows  around the corner
Inside a room, Garza's playing poker with three other cops: , , and
Who's winning
Laszlo, the cheatin' prick
Yer mama
Wanna sit in
If  had my Braille set, 'd clean you out
Not much of a game if you have to tell me what my cards are
Right
sorry
The other guys toss Garza a look -- what a moron
People forget
No worries
(turns away) Enjoy your game, fellas
Need help
Want one of us should walk you down

Unfamiliar places take me a little longer
But  get there

Good evening
Sorry for any confusion our last-minute change of location might have caused
148
'  -                                      148 That incredible city view -- skyscrapers all around, aglow with lights
Cantrell enters frame, drawn to the glass
slowly past out there, drifting among the buildings at our eye level
Cantrell raises his hand, places it on the glass, feeling the vibrations
The copter's searchlight sweeps the windows, highlighting him briefly with incredible light he can't see
149
-                                  149 but we can see the copter going by from here, searchlight playing over Cantrell's building -- which is plainly visible just across the way
to find Judge Burch at a table, as: please join me in a warm welcome for our keynote speaker this evening, Judge Laura Burch
She rises and heads for the podium amidst

you think 'd forget
just don't give Betsy any,  can't deal with dog farts all night
151
'  -                                      151 Cantrell's sitting in front of that incredible view with Betsy at his feet, on the phone: How long, man, 'm starving
152
-                                    152 Nick gets to his car, checks his watch -- and pauses
The time reads: "7:27
" Nick is suddenly hit with a momentary sense of dread
He glances up the street

reveals Nick in deep f

looking up the broad avenue -- in the distance stands Cantrell's skyscraper

Relax
Nick shakes off his misgivings, hangs up, gets in the car
153
'  -                                    153 Cantrell eases to the floor, sits with Betsy
He strokes her fur
She , uneasy
It's okay
It's gonna be okay
154
-                                            154 Judge Burch at the podium: Jonas was upset not to be here with you tonight
a personal matter came up
but he wanted me to give you all his fondest regards
155
-                                           155 at Cantrell's hotel -- a  steps into our shot, his back to us
He pulls a cell phone from his pocket, flips it open, sees the time: "7:29
" The thumb starts pressing numbers -- boop
boop
boop
156
'  -                                    156 -- Cantrell and Betsy against the incredible city view
He finally gets fed up with that surgery collar she's worn the entire movie, reaches around, unsnaps the plastic
He puts the collar aside, gently ruffs her shaggy neck
There
That's better
He puts his arm around her, taking comfort in her presence quiet, pensive moment

The thumb hovers a moment, then presses "send
" We hear the call  through
159
'  -                                      159 and Cantrell hears a strange
almost like a phone ringing -- sort of close but not -- weirdly muffled
He looks around, trying to pinpoint it
His head finally swivels down to Betsy lying at his side
She's , getting a little freaked, licking her stitches
Cantrell's hand travels down her fur to her belly
fingertips tracing the stitching
and what he can't see is the strange glow building under her skin
But he can sense it
His eyes widen slightly
and
The room is swallowed in a  -- 160
'  -                                      160 -- which        , the rows of windows vanishing in a storm of flame and shattering glass

-                                              161 Judge Burch and the others gasp as the explosion lights up the night from the building across the way
162
'  -                                            162 Nick slams on his brakes -- he cranes forward, gazing up in horror as the explosion is reflected in his windshield
163
-                                               163 The blast kicks from the face of the building, fireball rising with eerie grace into the night sky, as: The  steps into frame, pockets the cell phone him, losing Cantrell's building and bringing the other hotel into view -- the one with the lawyers
164
'  -                                            164 Nick jumps out, stunned
He runs up the street toward the hotel as glass and debris rains onto the sidewalk
165
-                                              165 People crowd to the glass, staring out at the skyscraper across the way -- at the smoking ruin that was once a floor
-   9-19-08                                        99
166
-                                                166 and the  bends down, picks something up
He hefts it onto his shoulder: a  -
He flips up the sight, takes aim at the other hotel, fires
-- the rocket streaks, leaving a contrail
167
-                                               167 : Judge Burch and those around her reacting as the glare of the rocket approaches in a heartbeat -- of the night takes out the ballroom, killing dozens, blowing flame and debris across the room
168
-                                                 168 Nick sees it: the contrail, the second blast, all of it
It stops him dead in his tracks
Just overwhelmed

The top dog:
He's seething but not a screamer -- a man who keeps it tightly reined: We're worldwide news this morning
Almost twenty dead, among them some of this country's top attorneys had friends in that room
Hell, almost attended myself
The second explosion
saw a rocket               * fired

* What you saw or think you saw is                   * beside the point
What matters is                  * that the  wanted to rendition                   * this man out of my city
The reason                * he's still here causing havoc is you
You wanted to prosecute this case
Your ambition kept him here                  * and provoked this tragedy

Detective
Your job is hanging by a thread
'd think a man of your experience would know when to keep his mouth shut and his ass covered

His
He rouses himself, flips it open

Some legal team from the mayor                 * showed up here this morning

You there
* * How'd you kill Jonas
know about the second explosion,  saw the contrail, so  know you got somebody working for you
But the first explosion -- how
Say you find a guy with a bad cocaine problem
Hungry ex-wives
Greedy mistress
Heavy gambling debts
* a bizarre sound occurs on the line -- an unidentifiable that grows and rapidly dissipates
Say that guy's a veterinarian
You                  * hand him a million in cash, he'll                   * do what you ask
Especially if he's                 * looking to blow town for good

You own the vet, you own the dog
Explosive wasn't even that big
Stuff  use, it didn't have to be
(beat) Hidden in plain sight
That's my specialty
Haven't you figured that out yet
Nick sighs, rubs his eyes, can barely even speak
What's next for you
Mulling career options
suppose law is out
'm trying to get over my friend being dead
Aside from that, fuck you
Fair enough
(beat) 'll miss you Nick
It was a good dance
Didn't bring your family back, though, did it
(off Clyde's silence) Has it made you feel better
All this
You done making your point
Just warming up
This is Clausewitz shit, my friend
Total war
on Nick, listening, as: 'm gonna pull the whole thing down
will topple the gleaming pillars and drag the whole fucking diseased, corrupt temple down on my head

- of the explosions -- file footage of Jonas Cantrell pops up
Nick drifts over, sits at her bedside, as: going live now to City Hall where Mayor Tilden is about to make a statement
announcing, we're told, among other things, the dismissal of District Attorney Nick Price
The  cuts to the Mayor stepping to the mic
Thank you all for gathering on this solemn and anxious occasion
-   9-7-8                                       103
Nick  it
He and Sarah don't speak for long moments -- he's waiting for her to pull herself together
She finally does, going into professional mode, pulling her laptop and files and reports around her
We got the latest batch of background in
Hansen and the other guy did some good work here-- Sarah
Give it a rest
It's over
We're done
(off her look) 'm done
The mayor is nailing my coffin shut
The best thing you can do right now is distance yourself from me as much as you can -- see what you can salvage of your career
Sarah is staring at him with "fuck you" in her eyes
She picks up a multi-page list of addresses, hands it to him
This lists over fifty shit-value properties in industrial zones that nobody in their right mind would want to own -- stuff around chemical plants, factories
All are owned by Benson Clyde
Look at twenty-two
Nick, not caring, scans down to: "Joe's Lube-and-Drive Garage
" Went out of business in '94
(looks up, irritated) Now why would Joe's extinct Lube- and-Shit Garage be of the slightest possible fucking interest to you, me, or anyone
(tight, pissed) The garage, not so much
But the address
Look at the location
Nick looks down at the list again
staring
175

Bordering it, on the other side of some fencing, are municipal train tracks

He gets out
It's a ghost town here
-   9-19-08                                        104
He goes to the garage window -- glass thick with dirt
He wipes with his sleeve, but it doesn't help him see in
176

We hear  and the door rises
Nick drops down, peering in
He squeezes under the door, stands up
Gloomy in here
He hits the door switch -- it  up       * on its tracks, flooding the place with light
* He looks around
Cobwebs
Dust
under a tarp on the hydraulic floor-lift
Old shelves and pallets of tools
Rust
Grime
The crap of ages
He sighs, turns and walks out

-                                             177 and pauses
Something tickling his brain
Suddenly, a    blasts by -- gone, dwindling
It was a bizarre, distinctive sound
like the one Nick heard during his last phone call with Clyde
Nick stands frozen, pieces in his head tumbling and threatening to fall into place
Something about the shape of that car under that tarp
He turns, staring at it
Goes back in, drawn to it -- it's long, distinctly old-school, with sharp boxy corners
He draws the tarp off -- finds a 1965 Lincoln Continental, midnight-blue, in excellent condition
The last time he saw it, it was parked in a carport at Benson Clyde's farmhouse
What's it doing here
More pieces falling into place
Nick leaves the garage again, walking out
across the tarmac, and as we come around the corner of the building, we reveal: The County Correctional Annex is right there, a backwater corner of the prison not sixty feet away
Nick stares up at it -- a very curious location indeed

behind shelves
the toilet
in closets
the grimy little office
He stops
Looks at the car
There's a mechanic's pit below that hydraulic lift
He goes to the control, hits "up"

There's a midnight-blue Lincoln traveling the streets far below
It turns a corner, moving up a long boulevard around a skyscraper, following

to the unmarked cars tailing it in traffic
visually, it becomes a surreal dance of headlights and traffic signals

The door rises

It stops next to a with the logo: "Nomos Custodial Services

to Clyde dressed in a custodial services uniform
He slams the car door, gets in the van, fires up the engine

You don't suppose Nomos Custodial                    * has a service contract with City Hall, do you
Off Dunnigan's look of "oh shit"
192
-                          192 as a card is swiped
-- the lock disengages

Mr
Nomos
Ain't seen you around
Ted
had to get that vacation in
Visited my sister in the Keys
Nice
Good for you
Hey, what's all that hoopla at the main entrance
Mayor's got a big fuckin' thing
Thousand dollar a plate whatever
They say the Governor might come
(moving on) 'll stay out of their way
(calls after him) They're up on six, avoid that floor
They got more security than God

He comes to a door, sorts his keys
197
-                                       197 and enters in darkness
Moving swiftly, he reaches into his trash barrel, pulls a gleaming   from under the shredded papers -- he strides to the judge's dais, lays the case atop it, turns and heads back to his cart
198
-                            198 as a     stampede into the building and up the stairs
Nick, Dunnigan, and Davies looming over the nervous security guard: What floor
told him to avoid six
(checking monitors) There
On a monitor: Clyde rolls his cart from the courtroom
That's the main courtroom on five
* That's right below the ballroom
The Mayor's event

as the   uses a small mirror to peek around the corner and spot Clyde: (whispering on headset) Subject in sight
Do we take him

Dunnigan       * raises his radio to say yes, but: No
Let him go
(off Dunnigan's look) We know where to find him
Let's get to that courtroom
Dunnigan hesitates -- against every instinct in his body
hope you know what the fuck you're doing
(clicks mic) Negative
We're letting him go
All units hang back
Repeat
We are letting the subject go

5TH   -                                    202 The cops trade surprised glances
The elevator
Clyde gets on, the doors close
The cops swarm up the hallway
203
-                                            203 This all happens fast: Bang -- the doors slam open
Nick leads a huge phalanx of cops and  in, weapons and flashlight beams stabbing in all directions
There
They race to the judge's dais -- the steel case
Don't touch it
Could be motion sensitive
Davies shoves his way to the front, grabs a small hand-held drill from one of his guys' tactical vests: need light
Dozens of beams converge
Davies places the drill, goes to work on the case

the drill taps through
Davies yanks it, feeds a fiber-optic tube into the hole, puts his eye to the eyepiece
He swivels the tube carefully, peering inside

Nasty ones

* Davies takes his eye from the eyepiece, looks at them
-4 is for girl scouts
This is malglinite
Take out the whole floor above us
maybe this entire corner of the building
Can you open it
Disarm it
(back to eyepiece) No, we got tripwires
We open this lid, instant karma's gonna get us
(keeps scanning) Don't see a motion sensor
Trigger looks simple
dial a cell phone, incoming call arms the trigger -- trigger's set to count down from forty seconds, then boom
(off their looks) That call comes in, we have forty seconds to get as far away from this thing as possible
(to his men) Alert the mayor's security team
* Evacuate those people upstairs --                    * clear that ballroom, go
No
Dunnigan turns on him, instant shouting match: No
What the fuck are you talking about, this could go off any second
-   9-7-8                                         112
He won't set it off until that room is full
People are still arriving, red carpet shit, that's at least another half hour
will not take that risk
You have to
Beat
Nick, no longer shouting, but intense and fast: If 'm him, 've rigged cameras in that ballroom -- live video feed -- first sign of an evacuation, trigger the bomb
(off their looks) We have to think ahead of this fuck
Pause
Looks traded
'm open
Okay, Nick
What's the move
206
/  -                              206 Clyde slams the van door, gets in the Lincoln
He pulls a handheld    -- it shows a   of people entering the ballroom, mingling as they arrive
Clyde smiles, starts the engine
207
-                                   207 The Mayor enters, waving to everybody, shaking hands
208
' --  -                          208 The garage door rises
The Lincoln backs in, stops on the hydraulic lift
Clyde gets out, throws the tarp over it
Briefly checks his clamshell
Still plenty of time
He raises the lift a few feet, drops down and crawls under the car into: 209    '                                                209 Duplicate controls
He hits the button and the car sinks down atop us, settling to the floor, sealing us into darkness

Beat
turns on -- one of those gazillion candlepower flashlights
Clyde aims it and we see: hewn into the wall of the mechanic's pit
Just large enough for Clyde to crawl into
He does
210
-                                               210 Hand-dug, rough dirt held up by two-by-four bracing
wheeled platform is the transport -- Clyde's on his back, pulling himself along by an overhead rope, hand over hand
211
-                                     211 Clyde emerges in the suffocating darkness of a sub-basement laid into a foundation that dates back to the Civil War
He crawls free, shining his light as rats scurry in shadows
He's on his hands and knees at first because the ceiling's so low
He's finally able to rise, moving along at a crouch
and emerging into a proper sub-tunnel
Now able to walk normally, he navigates the tunnels and comes to: 212
'   -                                 212 We're just below the solitary wing
Clyde has it rigged with all his needs: computer, spare cell phones, various kinds of clothing, even a shelf lined with snacks
He quickly shrugs off his custodian's outfit, revealing his prison jumpsuit beneath
He gazes up a welded steel ladder (identical to four others in a row -- one for each cell)
He checks his clamshell one last time, tweaking the bad reception with a relay -- ballroom looks full
He clicks off his lamp and clamshell, sets them on a shelf
He goes up the ladder to a hatch in the ceiling
213
'  -                                         213 and enters through a swiveling portal concealed behind the toilet
In deep darkness now, he pulls his cell phone, starts inputting a number -- boop
boop
boop
And he freezes
Realizing
There's somebody in there with him
a silhouette sitting on the floor by the door
The figure reaches out, pushes open the outer door a bit
Faint light spills in, revealing: came to talk
Guess who wasn't in his cell
Imagine my surprise
-   9-19-08                                      114
Imagine mine
Beautiful how you played us
Getting yourself tossed into solitary --                  * pre-rigged with exits from all five               * cells
Whichever one we put you in, you had your bases covered
(faint smile) thought  was such a bad-ass putting you down here
Turns out was doing what you wanted
That's how you play
Make the other guy think it's his idea
(beat) You came to talk, so talk
Been thinking
If 'd done things differently -- made different decisions from the start -- we wouldn't have gotten to this point
But it happened
And here we are
Here we are
(beat) Your decisions put us here too
This mess is on both of us
* You want to hold hands
What's your point
We can't change decisions we've made
We can only account for decisions we make from here
know what mine will be
(beat) What about you
You gonna finish dialing that number, or what
Clyde hesitating, thumb hovering over the number pad
If  don't
What are you offering
You looking to deal
-     9-19-08                                       115
'm willing to listen
Okay, here's the deal
The deal is
there is no deal
(off Clyde's look) told you
No more deals with murderers
'm sticking to that
That's my decision
It's what you                  * taught me
Strange as it sounds,                   * 'm grateful for the lesson
* Nick rises, steps out -- pauses, turns back
Your turn
You make the right decision, 'll see what  can do for you
But the wrong decision is one you'll have to live with the rest of your life
The moment stretches
Clyde poised -- all down to this
In        * the end, he can't help himself: Boop-boop-boop -- hits send
* 'm sorry
Me too
Nick pushes the barred door shut
because like  said, it's a decision you'll have to live with the rest of your life
Which at this point  figure is
(glances at watch) another 35 seconds
and turns the key in the lock -- klatch
Check mate
Clyde hears a
like a phone ringing -- sort of close but not -- muffled -- like the sound Cantrell heard
Clyde, realization dawning, thrusts his hand out and jerks the cot blanket up, revealing: The steel briefcase under his cot
He glances up to see: Nick gone
Clyde scrambles to his portal, yanks on the handle
-   9-19-08                                       116

215
' /'  -                          215 : Dunnigan thrusts himself out of the tunnel, cops grabbing his arms, pulling him free
216
-                                        216 Nick comes through the sally-port at a fast stride, through another door, goes up the steps
217
'  -                                         217 Clyde wheels around, frantic as a caged tiger -- he lunges to the door, rattling the bars
218                                                         218 while Nick pounds faster and faster up staircase after staircase
219
'  -                                         219 Clyde -- enraged, bellowing -- picking up the steel briefcase, swinging it hard against the bars, trying to batter through
And then stopping
self-awareness returning
Perhaps it's the Clyde that's been missing for years -- the sane one
Pause
He sets the briefcase down
Stands a moment
He sits down on the briefcase
Calm now
Pulls a from his breast pocket
Gazes at it
It's his wife and daughter
He stares at them a while
Tucks the photo back in his pocket
Nods
Well played
The  is staggering, instantly vaporizing        * Clyde and the cell he's in
220                                                        220 the bars right out of the stone on a that overwhelms the lens
221    :                                 221 with express-train force

222
-                                      222 and       skyward
Nick enters the shot as     , walking away from the building going to dust and rubble
, now following him, as he approaches Davies standing with Iger
Iger is staring, agog: Jesus
* (beat)                                          * Thank God that wing was empty
* car arriving behind them: Dunnigan getting out, approaching
* How do  explain this to the city
think the Mayor will have your back
Nick approaches, comes abreast of them
Looks are traded with Dunnigan and Davies
Relief
Fellowship
touch of sadness
Words aren't needed here
Nick keeps walking, pulls his cell phone, starts dialing
Dunnigan smiles
He knows exactly where Nick's going
223
-                                  223 : Nick sitting
waiting
An   moves massively into the shot, pulling into the station
Nick rises
, steel on steel
Nick engulfed in a crowd of arriving passengers, people getting off, swirling and jostling all around him, wiping frame
only two faces he wants to see
and there they are
He sweeps his family into his arms
The final moments of this movie are all about faces and joy
