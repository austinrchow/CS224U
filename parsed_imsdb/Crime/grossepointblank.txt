Both hands are gloved, instead of one, and the gloves are black

The figure positions himself and the putter above the ball, then pops the ball lightly
The ball rolls and bobs with purpose toward the hole, dodging hazards and finding lanes, until it finally falls off of the green and into the hole

The hands pull the wipe rag off of the top of the bag and drop it on the ground, reach into the bag, drawing out a compact  , affixed with a long silencer

- The outdoor post-golf luncheon area of an elite Texas golf club
Martin sits in on the fringes of a conversation between a group of executive types
#1 has a Buddha-like peace in his eyes through the philosophical talk
#1 'd come to the realization that everything 'd based my life on was false
And that my life had no meaning
#2 (to Martin) He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five
#1 It seemed like my life was slipping away, somehow
was a knot in the middle of a wet rope
Everything was futile and nothing had value
#3 That's the way life is
The only meaning and value is what we create
Through structure, and discipline
Though they seem to limit our freedom, they actually give us great comfort
Your problem is you're looking for some great answer
Some ultimate truth
When what you really should do is go to work and go home
#2 And take golf lessons
#1 That's a tragedy
Can  finish my story please
began my search for meaning
was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic
And they all pretty much say the same stuff
#2 Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing
You're insane
#1 Basically the same thing
In a very evolved, esoteric way
#2 Insane
#1 To make a long story short
#3 --Thank God-- #1 at last  found the holistic system of systems that opened up the doors of heaven for me right here on earth
And everyday  see the world through the eyes of a child
world of creation and wonder
#2 Jesus
#1 Overflowing with love
Tell me about it
Club Member #1 turns to Martin
#1 Personal Pan Power
All the secrets of your universe are divided up into eight easily digestible slices
Club Member #1 pulls a laminated card from his wallet and hands it over to Martin
In the distance, sirens begin to wail
#1 See, see
It's in the accessible and everyday shape of a pan pizza
Each day you have a little slice of peace
- - pizza-shaped diagram showing six "sections"
Oh  see
You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony
#1 You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight
It's the
Six Day Week
So you eat-- read it everyday
#1 Yes
And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven
#1 Correct
(re: the card) That's for you
Keep it
Sirens are getting louder, closer to the club
- The source of the sirens are almost upon us
Martin walks toward his rented Town Car as the  pulls it up
He meets the Valet by the trunk, where he trades tip for keys
He fishes out the laminated "Personal Pan Power" card, looks at it, and tosses it onto the ground
Police cars, now visible in the distance, wind into the long club driveway
Martin gets into his car and pulls away
As it lays on the asphalt
The wheel of a police car rolls to a stop on it
- Martin sits in a first class seat, the tray table flipped down
On the left side of the tray is a stack of magazines of all kinds - Sports Illustrated, Mademoiselle, Wired, Rolling Stone, National Review, Spin, National Geographic, and on
He draws one off the top, and flips through it, impassively taking in images and reading nothing
When he is done with one, he discards it into the empty seat next to him and draws another-- Martin's way of instantly and massively uploading the world around him: Toothless hockey player in triumph, Sony product parade, crouched starving child with vulture in the background, supermodel in suede, Tic Tacs, living former Presidents, arm in arm, smiling, etc
,   - The livery weaves out of the arrival lanes at Kennedy airport
Martin reclines in the back seat, a conversation having already begun
How was your day, today, sir
Effective
But to tell you the truth, 've lost my passion for work
Do you like the people you work with
work alone
That's it then
That's it
've always been alone
That's why 'm a good driver
can handle it
See,  can think on my feet
survive, 'm a thinker
And  can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me
Some people can't do it
Some people are ranting and raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, can't--  want a go
" Where you gonna go
You're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night
You ain't going nowhere
You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening
What's the big deal, right
You understand the psychology of the job
do
Some guys can't adjust to it; they can't handle it
-   - The car cuts through the upper east side
Martin and the Driver exchange looks through the rear-view mirror
You look like you're far away
Far away and thinking about other things
'm right about that, aren't
No
Well, let's just say that sometimes 'm right
Sometimes you are
Sometimes  am
Sometimes
It's only natural
(laughs to himself at this great truth) It's only natural
The Driver pauses for dramatic emphasis been looking at you, and 've decided that  want to share something with you
Okay
Because your problem is you're bored
And you have a very big mind
(beat) am part of what  call a brain syndicate
No reaction from Martin
am part of a network of minds, a group of five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of miles, through the mind
We can think with each other, think for each other
can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- whatever it is-- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else's mind, far away
Running someone else's brain

And when you think of it, it's not so surprising that a small group of people control the whole world, is it

He moves to the desk and draws one of three phones from his briefcase, depresses a scrambler module, flips it open, and listens for a moment
If it's not there,  can't proceed

Martin hangs up
Picks up another phone and dials
As he waits for an answer, he goes to a Fed Ex blueprint tube lying on the bed
Tom
've been waiting for an answer
'm only in town tonight
He breaks the shipping seal and pulls out a series of finished metal parts including a long thin barrel, a scope, and a silencer
What's different this time than the last time

- Martin stands in front of the window, phone in one hand, the scope in the other
Next to him, the assembled rifle rests across the arm of a chair
don't bother to call anyone else because you always take care of me
He glances over to a second window to his left, which offers a view further down the street
He goes to it
He raises the scope and sees '

Slung low across his right hip is a black canvas bag
The Messenger's hand is hidden in it

He sets down the phone and answers the other, still watching the messenger

The bicycle messenger flashes past
concentrating, tracks the path of the Messenger, leading him left to right across the blind spot of the hotel room wall between Window #2 and Window #1
the bicycle Messenger bears down on the group of men, drawing a Mac-10 submachine gun from his bag
The group see him-- just as Martin's sniper  explodes the Messenger's chest
Two of the Bodyguards collapse onto their boss
The other two open fire on the Messenger as he wipes out horribly into a parked car in front of them
withdraws from the window, and picks up the phone again and begins to break down the rifle
Sorry Tom
But look,  know it's the playoffs
That's why 'm offering a thousand dollars for one seat
Martin listens patiently as he works

Well let me ask you, Tom
What do have to do to get courtside tickets for the Knicks
The two bodyguards kick at the Messenger's body
The other two begin to move off of their boss, who rises cowering
The Doorman stands behind it all, unbuttoning his coat

He moves toward the group of men as he flips open his coat back over two huge chrome

He gets to the man at the bottom-- their boss
The Doorman both guns
reacts, surprised to see a second shooter
He pulls himself from the window, puts away his scope, and accelerates his exit
- Outside, we see the doorman drop both guns on the pile of bodies
He walks back toward us through the glass doors and makes his way through the building toward the service exit
He sheds his uniform and stuffs it into a plastic bag
his two parcels in hand, exits out the side door of the hotel and walks down the street
now wearing rich man's sweats, hops off the loading dock, walks to a Lincoln Town Car, and drives off
'    - Martin rolls down  Drive in a Lincoln Town Car once again on the cellular
Tell them that's not my problem

See you tomorrow, Marcella
Wait

Grocer for you
Patch him through
Martin notices another Town Car appears in the next lane
We recognize the Doorman behind the wheel, phone in hand
He is What do you want
'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts
Like a union
Like a club
Work less, make more
Thank you, no
We could be working together, making big money, killing important people
'm willing to let you in on the ground floor
And you could be
sort of like
a father figure to me
Grocer ignores this
It's a free-market evolution
You'll wake up to it
c'mon Kid
We used to run together when you were a rookie
don't want to run against you
This thing's real
Everybody's in
Not me
So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild

Martin hangs up and pulls away
- Martin sits in first class, wiping his face and hands with an airline hot towel
He folds the wet cloth and once again speeds through the images from a thick stack of magazines
He looks up as he hears
It's seventy-six degrees and partly cloudy in Chicago this afternoon
,  - Martin walks into a sparsely furnished apartment
He wearily drops his carry-on bag and briefcase in the hall
- Martin sits on a futon couch watching  with no sound
On the coffee table in front of him is a phalanx of vitamin bottles
Martin takes some capsules from each and washes them down with a reddish-orange beverage
- Martin lies on his back on the hardwood floor
His eyes are closed and he wears a set of headphones as he absently taps his chest
(
) "Dear Alumni: Can you believe it's been ten years
Where are you now

His head turns to the side, and his hands lightly cup the headphones

muffled but dire scream is heard from within and he is on his feet, gun in hand
An exit door in the hallway slams open revealing Martin, his gun already pointed at the Bodyguard
The Bodyguard levels his at Martin
Freeze
Police
The Bodyguard hesitates just long enough to get double-tapped through the head
(
) As a graduate of the class of 1984, you are someone special
Martin moves to the dead Bodyguard, and locates a retractable key chain on his belt
He unreels the ring of keys and opens the door
He lets the keys retract back to the belt and drags him into the apartment
'  - Martin moves silently down the hall in a crouch
He comes to the bedroom and slips across the threshold

) Whenever news of you filters back, the school is excited and proud of your accomplishments

He points the gun at the door, and reaching up turns the knob
As the door opens, the Husky Man  wildly over Martin's head
Martin returns with one shot to the hut which sits the man down on the floor

) We hope Grosse Pointe High prepared you well to lead the kind of life that makes an impact on the world
Martin kicks the gun away from the fallen man, and raises his barrel to the man's forehead

) Remember, "there's no where you can go that you haven't learned how to go in time
It's easy

For the first time, Martin looks scared

It's from one of those
Boxes
How was the trip
Tedious
now authorize you to throw away all personal mail
All of it
And not show it to me
Ever again
That's going to cost
'll pay
Martin begins to walk past her into his office, but Marcella stops him
They're not happy, sir
'm not happy
They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep
He didn't
They blame you for the compromise
And they want me to make up for it
In Detroit
This weekend
Tell them that's impossible
need my normal lead time
They were very upset
Would you describe their position as inflexible
Intractable, sir
You leave tonight
Marcella looks concerned
And sir,  also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one
There's nothing to be done about it
liquidated the last account in Zurich, and split it into two new ones in Estonia
Good
What else
Anything interesting
Mmm, not really
But you're gonna love this one
She hands him a piece of paper
He scans it
Enough
Never enough
But it's a Greenpeace boat
It'd be so easy
Martin looks at her wearily
He puts it into the paper shredder at the side of her desk

Next
Paperwork on the Detroit thing
It's a full dossier
Very comprehensive
She raises a thick brown dossier from the top of her desk and puts it down again
Martin moves through a door to his private office
' Martin goes into his office and sits at his desk
On the walls are a couple of boring prints of tallships
bookshelf holds trappings of a loose attempt at a cover-- a few shipping manifests, sealane tables, and other specialized reference books on import/export
He sits and stares
Time has passed, and Martin still sits at his desk massaging his gums with a rubber-tipped dental pointer

pulls back his jacket lapel and fits the utensil into a pocket protector that is also home to a toothbrush, emery board, tweezers, and comb
He stands and walks out of his office
Martin moves toward the door
As he passes Marcella she hands him the mauve envelope and a travel portfolio
Don't forget your identity
See you next week
Martin stops short as he reaches the threshold
He holds up the envelope, and stares a dagger through it
On his way out, over his shoulder
Tell Dr
Oatman 'm on my way
'  - Martin slouches on a leather couch
He holds the mauve envelope, now open
(
) Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion
It's in Michigan
Honestly, what do have in common with those people
Or with anyone
sits in the window
He is Kris Kringle-esque, and wears a sheepskin vest, rough-hewn shirt, faded Levis, and old Frye boots
Oatman nods with the suave understanding of a man happy to collect fifty thousand in fees before asking a tough question
You went to school with these people
Come on
We've spent a lot of time discussing those years
Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing
Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite
Shouldn't you be taking notes
Tell me about your vision of the reunion
- - : '
- Of a crowded gymnasium
The alumni below stops what they are doing and look up at Martin, ,   400 ,     ,
: It'll be depressing
How do you know
just know
Say more
They'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs
made themselves a part of something
And they can talk about what they do
What am  going to say
(sarcastic) " killed the President of Paraguay with a fork
" Oatman twitches nervously, almost spilling his coffee
You needn't be so frank with me about your work
Why not
trust you
You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege
and  don't want to be "withholding"
and  know where you live
You know where  live
We're both professionals, Oatman
think what you fear Martin is domesticity
It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture
It's centuries old
Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought
oh
the Saracens
"  So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families
So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie
He just wanted to fuck around
Yes
Mmm
Beat
And how have you been feeling about your
work lately
Uneasy
Dispassionate
Bored
It's just getting hard to go to work in a good mood
'm starting to think 've been in the business too long
Last week  did a guy younger than me
- : From the back of the darkened empty church, we see him mount the altar
priest in fact
' open the gilded doors to reveal the chalice
He removes it, squirts a clear liquid into the cup, and swishes it out
He returns the chalice to the cabinet
(
) The church seems to be purging itself of it's pedophile
Sits in the back pew of the church, now crowded for Mann
He watches the  lift the chalice into the air, murmur a prayer, and drink from it
The Priest collapses behind the altar
(
) It's a bull market
The chalice bounces free from the Priest's hand as it hits the ground
(
) Anyway, that never use to happen was always the prodigy
Now 'm just one of the guys
(
) Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is
guilt
Remorse
Over the innocent people you've killed
'  - If  show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there
don't care about that stuff, anyway
What stuff
(dismissive) Morality
Oatman's glad the session's just about over
Go to your reunion, Martin
See those people and discover what they mean to you
Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel
If  get antsy 'll kill a few small animals
Now we're making progress

Here's the news: He hasn't been in Portugal since '90

Why don't you read the file, man

7-11  - Martin continues to gaze at the structure as if it's a lunar landscape
(into phone) Dr
Oatman
Dr
Oatman
Please pick up if you're there
It's Martin Blank
It's gone
My house
It's not here
My house is gone and now there's a 7-11 here
And that's unfortunate
You can never go home again, Dr
Oatman
Martin hangs up
He watches one-stop shoppers come and go
(to himself) But  guess you can shop there

of a  leading him down a drab, antiseptic hallway
She banks into the sunlit room where a wispy woman in her late fifties sits expectantly on the edge of the bed clutching her purse in one hand, a filterless Pall-Mall in the other, a light coat on
This is
She suffers from Alzheimer's or something just as debilitating
Mary, your son's here
The nurse gently eases Mary up
Martin hugs Mary stiffly and pats her shoulders
Mary takes hold of Martin's arm
They start out of the room
- They walk past a school-yard park fitted with a set of swings, baseball diamonds, and a small grove of trees
She smokes and hacks
bought a new rug
That's wonderful, Mom
What's a revival tent
It's a place where religious people-- (knowingly) Marlin Perkins and Jim
Jim
His assistant
He acted like Marlin's son, only he wasn't
At least they never said he was
bet they were lovers, faggots
Yes, gay lovers
Wild Kingdom my ass
Mary coughs horribly
It's good to see you
'm sure you're curious about what 've been doing
spoke to your father the other day
imagine that'd be rather difficult
Nature made him then broke the mold
Martin decides to change the subject
They told me you're taking lithium, mom
Yes, they give me headaches
have a headache
You have a headache
have a headache
You have a headache
No,  don't have one
You don't have a headache
have a headache
Mary leans in close, smiling
We had a good laugh, didn't we
Yeah
guess we did
- As they head toward Martin's car, Mary stops and points to it
Why don't you return this car and borrow mine
Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back
think 'll go see Debi today
Of course you will
can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given left and never said goodbye to her
Take care of her
She's a keeper
Yeah
And a leader
Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange
have always thought about her and missed her
nurse approaches with a wheelchair
Separate the wheat from the chaff and you've got the candle cat
Together, Martin and the nurse help Mary into it
Mary gazes at Martin, taking him in
Remember no matter how impossible your problems feel
've known people without a chance in the world
And all of a sudden, they have lives
Time allows miracles
Let yourself breathe, son
Martin bends down and kisses her on the cheek
The nurse spins the chair around and heads toward the building
He is somewhat fatigued from the experience, but he tries once more to connect
Mom
The nurse stops and turns Mary around to face him
Mary looks up at Martin and brightens
She starts to sing out like Ethel Merman, arms out Broadway style
"What's up doc/ what's cookin'
/ What's up doc
/ Are ya lookin'
/ Hey
Look out
You're gonna hurt someone,/ with that old shotgun,/ Hey
what's
up
Doooooc
/ We really mean it
" Mary stops short, and squints at Martin
Hey, you're a handsome devil
What's your name
- Martin stops the car and looks out the window at the sea of headstones
He jerks his hand in a stiff wave
Hey Pop
You got off easy
The house is a 7-11
Mom's a psycho- pharmacological punching bag and murder for cash
If you were here think you'd be proud
He drives off
'  - The room features a big square bed, dresser and television
Martin enters, kicks a leather bag under the bed, and grabs the steel-sided briefcase
pries out a wall vent, slides in the case and replaces the vent
- Lardner and McCullers are staked out along the main strip of town
Lardner snores, face pressed up against the passenger window
McCullers lays back in his seat, a to-go cup in his lap
He taps the cup with one finger as he absently sings his favorite Bob Seeger song to himself
"
Against the wind
just a young man running
Against the wind
let the cowboy's ride
Blame on it the thuuunder
Night moves
" McCullers catches of Martin's Town Car coming down the street
He nudges Lardner, and points
of Martin pulling into a space on the street outside the radio station
He gets out, looking nervous
- Debi flips on the "-" switch and prepares to speak into the microphone
Martin walks in
Debi sees him
They stare at each other
The song ends
Dead air
After a moment
(on air, groping) playing all vinyl, all the time
Oldies from the eighties
That was ah
the Specials
Doing
one of their songs
Debi turns to turntable  and finds it empty
She turns back to turntable  and lets the record roll on
and here's another
Debi swivels around to face Martin
"Oldies from the eighties
" After a long pause
just play my own collection
It's nice to see you again
Debi says nothing, just stares at him, in shock
How long has it been
Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word
Ten years,  think
What  miss
Debi slowly grooves into irony, her best defense
Well, let me see
they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael
Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven
was married and divorced
And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand
We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months
Here is now there
There is here
Their eyes lock on each other
Those are the headlines
The request line buzzes
Hold that thought
(into phone) , Grosse Pointe
All vinyl, all the
(pauses) No Pearl Jam
Call back in ten years
Beat
Debi makes the move
Tell me about yourself
'm in California most of the time
Traveling a lot on business
That's about it, really
That's it
Not much else
What's your business
'm a professional killer
Professional killer
Do you get dental with that
Beat
Well, 'm in town for a few days, anyway
They run out of words, the moment too big for small talk
Martin gets the fear, breaks it off
Well,  gotta go
But 'll come back
Okay
Martin leaves Debi sitting alone, in disbelief
- Martin steps out of the storefront station along the fashionable Grosse Pointe shopping district
He stops in the middle of the street with a strained look on his face
& '   - & '
of Martin standing in the street
They frown, wondering at Martin's next move
- Debi lost in thought, still
After a moment, she sits upright and flips the "-" switch
(into mike) man comes to you
He is from the past bringing you pain long since put behind you
He says peculiar things and leaves abruptly
It all comes flooding back
- Martin stops in his tracks
His face softens, then becomes determined
He turns and walks back toward the station
- Debi broadcasting
It felt like an apparition, or some cheap, gruesome Rod Serling time warp 'd been thrust back into without warning
There's a strangeness in the air and  don't mind telling you, 'm a little spooked
He was a man from my past
man  loved man who disappeared
'
of Martin walking back into the station
man who's walking back into the station
Martin comes into the booth
The temperature rises as they square off
- Well
don't think so
Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the -- --Nooo-- --Yes
And the Munich Olympics in '72
local radio station started broadcasting news of the massacre two minutes before it happened
McCullers is not to be outdone
That's strictly Baader-Meinhof stuff
It was the
Whatever
Martin and Debi locked in a passionate embrace
They break away
Sit
Martin obeys
Debi clandestinely flips the "-" switch as she drops into her chair
The "-" light bar goes on above and behind Martin
Unbeknownst to him their conversation is put out over the airwaves
All right mystery man
want some answers
Let's recap
Spring of '84
Two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry
The girl sits in a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at her father's house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life
The boy never shows up, until now
So, what's the question
Where have  been
More like what happened
What happened, Mr
Blank
don't know exactly
could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization
thought you know
maybe seeing you, some friends, my house
of course now a 7-11-- --Torn down in the name of convenience-- --and  guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation suppose the most important thing, really
don't know
Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea
It's my shrink, really
Ohhh
You're in therapy too, Marty
You see someone
Uh, no
So you're back now, a decade later, and you want to sort things out with me
The question now is, do allow you
access
to my being
Martin says nothing
All right then
Would you like to share any more deeply personal thoughts with our listening audience before we go to our phone poll and see how the folks in radioland come down on this one
beat as Martin realizes he's been had
He seems about to bolt
Should a broken-hearted girl give a guy a second chance at love
Debi jabs a phone line on the console
() You're on the air
Martin deflates
' think this young man has avoided the question completely
Has not discussed "what happened" nor if he's sorry for what he has done
Therefore,  don't see any reason why you should see him until he fully discloses his intentions and feelings
Thank you caller
Stabs another line
You're on the air
Are you there
Yes
No, the guy
Martin looks up, humiliated
Yeah
Uh
when you guys use to go out
Did you guys ever
heh heh heh heh
ever fuckin', ever totally fuckin' heh heh heh- Next caller
don't know, Debi
Sounds like bad gas to me
would not allow him access to your being
Thank you
Grosse Pointe Michigan,  hear you loud and clear: "If you love something set it free
If it comes back to you it's, well
She turns to him and shrugs apologetically
Broken
" Martin has his answer
- Martin leaves the station, alone and beaten down
Dammit
Never trust my instincts
He scans the main strip
'
walks down the street
He is , a bookish, forgettable man in his forties, wearing Le Coq Sportif sweats and shoes
He looks as if he has a dark cloud over his head
Martin's seen him somewhere, and doesn't like what he remembers
Martin's   him
'
As he walks down the street, he spots the Country Squire, and eyes Lardner and McCullers in the front seat
'
follows Felix's eyes to Lardner and McCullers and catches their look
Their eyes lock, neither wanting to betray that they've made each other
They all do a pretty good job
His swings to a square-jawed, hale fellow wearing dark sunglasses who is approaching directly and only a few feet away
The man is going for something in his breast pocket
Reaches into his own jacket, most likely for a gun
pulls out a glasses case, and takes off his shades-- He is Martin relaxes
(grinning ear-to-ear) Hell,  would've voted for you, but there's all this apple sauce stuck in my phone
don't wanna talk about it
How the hell are you
(extends his hand) Here's five good ones
No trace of recognition on Martin's face
Marty
It's me
Paul
(realizing) Paul
(re: hand) You're leaving me hanging here
They shake
Martin looks him up and down, astonished at the respectable veneer of his old burn-out friend
Hey
Give me a break
'  - Martin and Paul rive through Grosse Pointe, Michigan: Wide streets lined with huge, shady oaks
Castle-like homes on golf-course green lawns
comfortable, Midwestern Beverly Hills
They are cruising their old haunts, Paul smoking a joint
This won't take but a minute
just gotta hold their hands for a final walk-through
'll take them in, get 'em out, then you and  can grab a little quality time
Martin looks out the window, breathing in the past
Goddamn, It's good to see you
was afraid you joined a cult or something
half-expected you to come back to town in a fennel wreath and paper pants
Paul offers Martin the joint
He declines
There was no money in it
Martin regards Paul archly
(grinning) So what happened to you
Same thing that happened to you-- stopped poutin' there on the sidelines
Got in
Got on the team
joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul
Fair enough
Beat
God it's great to see you
You too
- '
of a lovely   on the front porch of a mid-sized Wright home
Perhaps that could be him if things were different, but for now it feels like along shot
Paul is hawking the house to them out of earshot
(
) Well, we do what we have to do if we find you on the property
But we don't really enforce the law, we execute company policy for homeowners
standing in the driveway
So when are you authorized to use deadly force
Well, a 'course, taxes provide your basic service-- police and whatnot
But our customers need a little more than just that, you understand
This badge doesn't mean that  am a peace officer
The woman turns at Martin and smiles
Martin smiles back
So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything
That badge is just the badge of your company
If  look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah
To shoot me
To shoot you
Correct
How did you get this job
Well, they were hiring, and it was only a two week course
(pleasantly) Wow
Paul walks the happy couple down the steps
(to couple) What more can  say
(smiling) We'll talk soon
(much hand gesturing) You'll be raising your new family in a work of art
work of art in a work of art
Paul looks at Martin and the Guard, inviting them into the sell
'm sure you'll be very happy
All look to Martin
(heartfelt) When my time comes, if it ever does, want a beautiful, normal place like this
and a wife like you
All are confused
Martin thumbs to the guard
and you'll be safe here
Paul looks at his shoes and rolls his shoulders
Lardner and McCullers sit in the wagon, watching the house in the distance
'  - Martin and Paul cut through a particularly charming neighborhood
Now
don't make a habit of pimping my friends, but there is one prime little piece of land that you must see
'
sprawling gingerbread mansion rises into view
long and winding driveway cuts through thickly wooded property to the house
(
) Debi's house
(
) Kind of crept up on you, didn't it
No
You drove us here
Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it
No
Martin's not listening
His eyes track the house out the window
'
of the mansion
They roll slowly by Debi's house
They drive in silence for a beat
Paul suddenly swerves to the shoulder, jams the brake, and turns on Martin
Ten years
What happened
freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself
'm a professional killer
Thank you
Paul, satisfied, gets back on the road
Professional killer, huh
Does that come with a good
- Paul makes a turn
They approach a large car dealership
The sign above it says "'   " (looking ahead) He sells 's
He sold me this bad boy
How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully
He gave me a great deal
Mein Dealer
Paul slows outside the lot
-- a big, angry- looking man in an expensive suit-- stands in the lot, puffing up amidst his stable of expensive cars
Hey
Bob
The car's running great
(dismissive) Glad to hear it
Bob turns his back on them and begins to walk away
(shouts) Bob
(turning) What
It's me
Martin Blank
Really
So what
Okay
See you later
- Martin climbs out of Paul's car and begins to walk toward his own
Paul calls after him
See you at the left-a-boy-came-back- a-man-made-good party
Martin nods him off
Paul pulls away
stands across the street from the radio station, looking at Debi in the window
Martin draws a thin rifle scope from his back pocket, and lifts it to his eye
'
- of Debi, in the crosshairs, bored, tapping a pencil to the beat of an unheard song
dejected
He puts the scope away and gets in his car
7-11 - Martin walks into the store, looking around once again at his old home
To the left of the door, a typical suburban teenage  is lost in the "Mortal Combat" video game and something too loud from his walkman
Carl, still working the double, nods to Martin
Can  help you
What's done is done
Martin moves up one aisle to the gum rack
He picks out a pack of Beaman's and unwraps a stick as he heads to the counter
On the way, he makes a black Town Car pulling into a spot next to his own
He immediately changes course, and bee-lines for a rear aisle where he ducks down
Comes through the door, drawing a Mac-10 for each hand
grabs the gum out of his mouth and sticks it onto the bottom of the Glock
9mm he has produced from somewhere in his suit
grabs the cash drawer, sets it on the counter, and puts his hands up
Plays on
Felix shoots   on his way toward Bolts up the cooler aisle
Bursts of  follow him, taking out each freezer door behind him
John Woo-style between the aisles of the cramped store
Felix delivers a close-to-home burst as he jumps the counter, sending Martin diving out of view
pinned behind the Slurpee machine, pauses to reload his now two Glock nines
Martin steals a glance to get a bead on Felix and is met with a salvo that rocks the Slurpee machine, spattering him with several flavors
and that's all he can take
Martin comes up  with both guns, but all that's left of Felix is swinging doors and squealing tires
Martin moves to the cashier island, low to the ground
Twitches and jerks, still absorbed in his game and oblivious to the surrounding carnage
Martin crawls through the waist-level swinging door and moves to Carl
is really dead
Martin rolls him over to check it out and finds under the corpse
Flips the corpse back on top of the device and leaps the counter toward the doors
He grabs the shoulder or the Skateboarder, who shrugs him off, annoyed-- What the fuck, man
The video game screen explodes
Shot full of Martin's bullets
The Skateboarder reacts backward and Martin jerks him out of the double doors
7-11 - The Skateboarder is running like crazy, and Martin's car is peeling out in reverse as the 7-11 is blown to hell
'  - Martin's hair is matted with Slurpee as he tries to drive and cool out
He sees his do in the mirror, pulls out a comb and starts to comb it back into a slick Pat Riley style
- Martin walks in, not looking half bad, considering
Debi looks up from some reading
"Naive Melody" by the Talking Heads plays in the studio
Are you going to the reunion
No
'm not going
Is that why you're here
That's part of it
Well, you'll have a ball
You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back
The car, the suit, the watch
The look
That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view
It's always the little things
Yep
Beat
'm wondering how you've been
How you are
'd like to catch up with you
If it's possible
Beat as Debi considers
She spins her seat to face him
Okay
Let's catch up
You go first
Well, there's not much to tell
'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years
You've had experiences
Bad experiences
You met people
Bad people
Watched television
Bad television
(amused) Jesus
Marty
You're pathetic
It sounds like you need a Shockabuku
What's that
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever
That'd be good
Beat
What do you want
The question is open
figured  could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out
Yes
Unbelievable
Seven it is
'll think about it
- Under a crisp and starry night, a man and a woman sit around a campfire
As we   we see that the woman is Marcella reading, "Women Who Run With Wolves
"  She tends to s'mores on the campfire, assembles one, and hands it to , her young outdoorsman boyfriend
Monty is perched on a small boulder, engaged in a Tai-Chi-like ritual, wearing Patagonia's finest
There is a path of crystals leading from the fire to the boulder
In the background is a tent and a Nissan Pathfinder
Monty's watch goes off
Baby, it's eight o'clock
Marcella gets up
Thanks, Monty
She tousles Monty's hair on the way to the truck
- Marcella gets in
She shuts the door and dials the phone
Hey there, how'd it go
'  -  - Martin sits on the edge of the bed in a towel
It isn't done
Marcella pauses, taking this in
This is not good
'll do it tomorrow
Marcella considers this
What's it look like
It's fine
You haven't looked at the dossier
(a little defensive) 've looked at it
Martin eyes the vent
You have
Yes
It's the same as usual
Nothing remarkable about it at all
have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late
Tell them my house exploded
Beat
Marcella doesn't know what to make of this
'll call them and tell them you're taking your time
Being a professional
Okay, call them
Fine
Oh-- And if you could find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back-- that's be great
Will do
Martin hangs up
He moves up to the air vent, deciding to get down to business
He pries it open, and withdraws his briefcase, putting it down on the bed and propping it open
He looks at the unopened dossier for a moment, flips it over in his hands, and tosses it on the bed
We catch a glimpse of Martin's weapons
Martin picks up the envelope and is about to tear the seal when Martin drops the envelope and lifts the receiver
(filtered) Are you there
Yes
Pick me up at my father's house at around seven
And don't be late this time
Beat
Hello
This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship
You're fucking psycho
Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in
She hangs up
Martin smiles and replaces the receiver
He turns to the apparatus laid out on the bed
, ,
What has been his life is beginning to look more like death to him
He places the envelope in the case, then returns the case to its hiding place
- Lardner and McCullers stake out Martin from the Country Squire across the street
wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job
We can't do our job unless he does his job
Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here
Do his job
'm not a cold-blooded killer
Wait a minute-- -Look
You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy
So if we do his job, we're the bad guys
If we do our job, we're the good guys
Yup
They both laugh, as if at some great joke
Their laughter is caught short by the sight of ' moving into the diner
- Martin sits in a window booth splitting nutrient caplets into an apple juice and looking out the window
slides into the booth, across from Martin
Martin draws a nasty little  pistol from his waist, and levels it at Grocer under the table-- but Grocer is already drawing his pistol down there, and there is an instant Mexican breakfast stand-off
Easy, tiger
waitress approaches
Hi
Welcome to
McCafferty's
My name is Melanie and 'll be your server this morning
Let me tell you about some of our specials
Today we have the "Alfalfa on My Mind," our feature omelette
And there's our "Gatsby's West Egg Omelette
" And if you're in the mood for something different there's the " left my heart in San Franchezie
" Martin and Grocer's eyes remain locked
want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done
English muffin for the bread
And a coffee
Whole-grain pancakes
And an egg- white omelette
What would you like in the omelette
Nothing in the omelette
Nothing at all
The waitress nods pertly and leaves
(re: the omelette) Come on, live a little
'm sorry about the incident yesterday
No harm no foul
little misunderstanding among my associates
Beat
told them to kill you and they didn't
Hard to get good help these days
But since we're both here,  think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship
didn't get into this business to have "associates
" And  don't want to join your Goddamned union
"Loner-- " "Loner gunman
" Get it
"On my own
" That's the whole point
Why don't you become a cop, or something
You can drink coffee in the morning
with friends
Grocer looks a little hurt
(easing up) Look, this is a one-on-one business
Every time you get to know people, bad things happen
If it'll make you feel any better, this is my last job
So what do you say we put our guns away and forget the whole damn thing
Grocer loses it
Fuck you
No scabs
From now on, everything's regulated
Long beat as Grocer gets a hold of himself
No deal
Fine
But we're not going to let you do your job
Because we're gonna do it
And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job
(Wry) Is that right
Yeah-- after  shoot you through the fucking forehead 'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole
Nice talk, Sugarmouth
-  - Martin sits at a desk, staring at the reunion card
He tosses it aside, gets up, and moves in front of a mirror
He wears a crisp black suit and practices his greeting smile
(trying on smile) Yes, 'm a pet psychiatrist
sell couch insurance
test-market positive thinking
lead a weekend men's group, actually
We specialize in ritual killings
'm hungry, are you hungry, 'm hungry, oooh, ooh
(sarcastic) Hi, 'm Martin Blank, remember me
'm not married,  have no kids and 'd blow your brains out if someone paid me enough
So how've you been
Where do you stand on The Issues
Are you Left
Right
Up, down, proud, shamed, blahblahblahblah-- '  - Martin makes his way up the walk leading to the front door, holding a simple bouquet of flowers
He skips up the front steps and finds the doorbell
After a moment, Debi answers
Flowers
That's funny
As long as  get the laugh
(taking them) Here
Let me put these in some rubbing alcohol
She backs into the house, and he follows
- Martin follows Debi into the hall
Both are enjoying this atavistic ritual
You look beautiful
Okay
Hold on
'
through a doorway leading into a den
All that's visible of , Debi's father, is a pair of legs resting in a Barcolounger
(
) Let me get my coat
'll just help myself to a cocktail
moves up the stairs and disappears
looks at the legs, rolls his shoulders, and heads into the den
- Mr
Newberry sits in the recliner reading a Tom Clancy novel
He is a corporate Aspen-dude-ranch sort with a good head of hair
He sighs, closes the book on his knee and looks up to Martin
Good evening, Mr
Newberry
Good evening, Mr
Blank
How are you
How's business
Martin,  don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and  don't care
It was good that you left, and 'm glad you did
So what do you want to talk about
You've grown up a bit
Maybe had you figured wrong
How's that
visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes 've been seeing in Newsweek
took the other road
'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation
love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone
And you
Oh, you know me, Martin
'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed  got shot for at Kent State
But why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing
Newberry lays down his book, and moves behind the wet bar
Why not
So what are you doing with your life now, son
'm a professional killer
That's good
Debi's footsteps are heard coming down the stairs
(
) Okay Mr
Newberry watches Martin turn and walk out of the room
' Martin and Debi pull away from the curb
- Martin and Debi drive through that to Debi is town, and to Martin is a widening pool of quicksand
Do you want to get a drink first
think they'll probably have booze there
Right
Martin's right hand shakes off of the wheel a bit
He grips it tighter
Suddenly, Martin turns the wheel and pulls into a gas station parking lot, halting next to a pay phone
'll just be a second
Debi nods, a little confused but going with it
Okay
- Martin stands at the kiosk next to the Town Car, mid- conversation
(defensive) Well,  didn't kill anyone, but someone tried to kill me and the guy in the middle got killed
So if see that guy again 'm definitely going to kill him, but  won't kill anyone else
Oh, except for the guy was sent here to kill
don't know
'  - Oatman treats his patient
What else
Say more
Saw my mom
'm with Debi, and 'm on my way to the reunion
In the background, Lardner and McCullers drive past the station
Okay
Repeat this after me
Out Loud
Martin looks to Debi
She looks up and smiles
We hear Dr
Oatman's command, Martin mumbles them back
am at home with the me
am rooted in me, who is on this adventure
Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing
This is me breating
Martin takes in a few breaths
Alright, look
gotta go
And don't kill anyone
Right
Don't kill anyone
'  - Felix rummages delicately around the room
He goes to the The reunion invite
picks it up and scans it
- Lardner and McCullers sit it the parking lot
They watch Martin and Debi pull into a space
He's falling for her
Look at him
He using her
You're wrong
Look at his face
One cannot love and kill
(defensive) love
kill
climb out of the car
Martin, breathing deeply and wiping his sweaty palms, leans against the car and tries to calm himself
Eighties music echoes from the gym
(to himself) Shoulda brought my gun
What
He pulls himself off the car and heads toward sprawling red-brick Gothic structure with many wings
It is topped by church-like towers
It's scary
- Martin and Debi enter and pause to take in the entire scene
benevolent Ronald Reagan hangs crookedly above
Basketball nets are swung back, draped with crepe
Lights are half-low and the music is loud
Alumni are dancing
Welcome back
'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph
'm Martin Blank
Debi Newberry
Debi heads off into the gym, smiling back as she strands Martin
Arlene rises from a card table
They have little to say
Martin wasn't part of her crowd
Marty, you haven't changed a bit
Don't say that
Arlene gives him a
As a special torture, the tags have
Martin looks at the name tag uncomfortably
We had pictures put on, that way everybody knows who everybody was
Wonderful
So, what are you doing now
Whatever  can get away with
She smiles at his joke and is immediately distracted by the next arrival
Martin moves off
(to the next person) Isn't it cute
It's so everybody knows who everybody was
He circles the crowded gym
Looking for familiar faces
He stops at the open bar
What can  make you
Beer
The bartender gets him a beer
Martin recognizes a guy at the bar
He is well-appointed and shiny
He is
Hey, Ken
How have you been
(glancing at Martin's name tag) Hello Martin
How have you been
Not bad
You
Bob Destephano arrives next to them and orders a drink
Eye contact is made
Hello, Bob
Hey, Bob
Bob turns slightly toward them
They continue in their conversation
'm an attorney
'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer
That sounds pretty interesting
Bob wants to join the conversation but doesn't know how
Sometimes
'm in divorce, mainly
Some property
Some personal injury
Those all seem kind of related
Bob takes another drink and mopes off, Martin watches him go
Tragedy makes you thirsty
Ken chuckles
The bartender arrives with the bottle
Martin grabs it and begins to move off
Well
have to take this over to Debi
Here
Take my card
Wait a minute
here's a special one
For top-shelf clients
Ken hands Martin a Monte Blanc pen with Ken's title and business address printed on the shaft
Martin reads it and puts it in his kerchief pocket
Thanks
Ken goes back to listening to the Guys at the bar
makes his way through the upbeat crowd of well-wishers emerges like an inkspot on a clean white whirt, and intercepts Martin
His angst is barely under control as he sidles up to Martin
don't know, Blank, all these fucking people, driving me crazy
Look at them over there, memorializing old times, acting all like it was something "life-changing
" And the people in the National Honor Society
The name tags
Martin shrugs
They have special blue starts on them like it fucking matters now that they were in the honor club ten years ago
'm getting fucking nauseous from all this sentimental bullshit
It's making me sick
Terry stops suddenly as if he's finished
Martin reads this man's nametag
Why are you here
Terry
Terry turns on a dime
wanted to see a couple people
But don't want to talk about the old days
What did we have together, Martin
Typing
(remembering) Drafting
Yeah,  couldn't stand that fucking class
But  appreciate you helping me out, man
Don't mention it
Yeah, thanks
Well 'm going to try and get out of here, man
'll see you later
Terry slinks off
- Bob Destephano grabs two more scotches off the bar and turns to leave, thoroughly morose
In his path, he finds , the good-looking side of brainy
Bob
Bob Destephano
What
'm Dan
Dan Koretzky
Computer guy
Yeah
Hey,  saw you at your dad's dealership the other day
sell 's
What do you do
Not much, actually
My software company just went public so 'm just
hanging out, really
There's a sudden lull in the conversation
Bob tries his drunken hand at relating
Remember high school
Sure
Listen
Why don't you join us up in the grandstands
Dan points up to a group of happy, laughing people
Bob walks off shaking his head and smiling bitterly
- Debi and Martin are seated at a round table with six others in an area blocked off for dinner
Plates of gumbo are arriving and the wine is poured
, an African-American, is in mid-conversation with , who looks like she walked out of a Laura Ashley catalog and sits on the other side of Martin
and  are two suits in the midst of a non- stop sports conversation
You gotta hold the fans responsible, though, Dennis, because they're the ones putting up with the mediocre product
guess, though, you know, if you look at it Mike, that park is a beautiful park, 've gone to that park many times - 've had the greatest time of my life at that ballpark and let's face it,  tell you this, Mike, by the sixth inning, if you're having the fun you should be having at Tigers Stadium, you don't even know what the hell's going on anyway
They both crack up at this
, , & Have you two been together since high school
No-- --Yes
Actually we just bought that little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue
Debi's a social worker and mow down insurance claims at Aetna-- We haven't seen each other since high school
figured
You two look too happy together
shouldn't say that though, 'm married
So, Martin-- what are you up to these days
What do you do for a living
Debi perks up; this should be interesting
'm in pro-active international relations
It's a very specialized company
We execute economic investment opportunities
Sort of economic clean-up
with an emphasis on personnel
It's boring, you know, it's boring
don't like to talk about it because  don't think what a man does necessarily reflects who he is
Martin begins to draw strange looks from all over the table
Martin may be in trouble
've always tried to refrain from a black-and-white moral lexicon--you know, good, bad, right, wrong--'ve been more interested in the gray areas
Silence
Martin pushes on
But that's no way to live
guess you've got to just take the leap of faith
Believe in something
Fuck it
Sounds complicated, Martin
Are you happy
just have to close this one last account
'd like to just stop now, today, but  can't
It's a step in the right direction
don't know, Martin
It sounds like you're feeling compromised
Live the way you want
The only thing that's inexcusable, to me, is cynicism
That's the biggest cop-out there is
Nods of assent come from around the table
brief silence, and then
But wait
still don't understand what you do
work at Kentucky Fried Chicken
Debi suppresses a laugh
You do not
Yes  do
You don't
In the corporate offices
Oh
really
Yeah
What do you do
sell biscuits to the Southland
You do not
It's what  do
You're so funny
sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland-- --Stop it-- You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets
move all of those-- --No
Sometimes we sell them to McDonald's and just change them to special barbecue sauce
Across the table from Martin and Debi, Dennis turns to Darius
What do you think about black coaching in the , Darius
Because  think it's great
don't pay much attention to football
have to agree with you Dennis
It's good to see that the owners are willing to put the franchise behind a black head coach or  when for years in the league they've been kept out of the thinking positions and relegated mainly to the physical game
But now, you see, you have Warren Moon at the helm, Cunningham, Art Shell, and the coach up at Minnesota
Dennis Green
And if you remember, Doug Williams was the first black man to prove that on a Superbowl Sunday
Amy leans in to Martin
(to Martin) 'm teaching art at Cedar Junior High School
Yeah, listen
Where do you stand on this whole Louis Farrakhan issue
(facetious) 'm a De Klerk man myself
Debi nods, indicating to the deejay stand
'm going over to play some tunes
Martin watches her walk away
-  - Dan Koretzky sits with two other --turned- handsome-fellas who now enjoy a confidence that comes with early investment in Microsoft
Martin looks out over the milieu below, enjoying the seene
He eavesdrops on a group of men from a few rows back
Look at her
There it is
Jenny Slater
The finest thing that ever walked these halls
- #2 believe she married the state of Maine
Yeah, he's around here somewhere
What a shame
She would have looked great in my fucking Bentley
- #3 No, my friends, Jenny Beam
Not only was she as fine, if not finer, than Slater, but she had the "bad girl" thing going for her
And the red hair
'mon
She's a paramedic in Skokie, Illinois
- #2 You both are mistaken
Jenny Maretti was the finest
No question about it
- #3 The three Jenny's
Three Jenny's
All named Jenny
You know what 'm really hoping
That Jenny Slater gets divorced
And she's twenty-eight-- - #3 --she's got half the state of Maine-- She's twenty-eight years old, with two kids, she's still really really fine, and  see her at a bookstore or something, and she sees me for what  was then, and what  am now: the redemption for all her failure
- #3 You mean the redemption for all your failure
They ponder this
Martin looks down on the gym, concentrating on Debi
Dancing drunkenly, miserable, like an unbalanced orangutan
: -   - Martin stands by Debi as she sits in for a set in the deejay booth, on a raised stage
They are playing an old sophomoric game
Which would you rather
Okay
Would you rather
commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week
Soft
'll take the junkie otter, clearly
'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants
Okay
Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller-- --She's not dead--- It's just a game
Alright
Candied Diller, or
wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth
Wow
have to give this some thought
No time
Okay, then
Clearly candied Diller
breaks the moment, looking up at the two, horrified and unsure at what she's heard
Marty
Debi
How are you
So many people came, but  never expected to see you Marty
Or you Debi mean
because of what your divorce
didn't mean to say that
just meant you look so good
Thank you
Do you think you could play "Too Shy'" by Kaja Goo Goo
Stacey, why don't you come up here and take over for a little while
'd love to
Stacey nods thanks and makes her way up into the booth as Martin and Debi make their way down
(to Martin) Everybody thinks they know me now that 'm divorced
She leads Martin toward the exit
It's time to see you in private
Martin and Debi walk down the hallway, alone together
Even though  left, you never left me
Not just memory but a substance in my blood
(smiling) Like heroin
Too junky-kitschy
Deeper, deeper
(enjoying this) Like love
Could be
The physical substance of love
Debi stops
'll accept that
Follow me
Together they move into what appears to be the Nurse's Office, and close the door behind them
' Martin and Debi make wild banshee love
- Lardner and McCullers watch Felix into the gym
Looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us
If he does our job, he's our job
get it
- steps through the doorway he's standing in and strolls into the crowded gym
He wears the standard khaki-pants-blue-blazer combo, with no nametag
He's clearly too old for the class of 1984
- Martin and Debi come out of the Nurse's Office
The post- coital mood is broken as they hear The Human League's "Don't You Want Me, Baby
"  blasting from the gym
Martin and Debi tune in on the song for a moment, unhappy at remembering that particular moment in pop music history
Debi looks to Martin, something must be done about it
'll be right back
Debi kisses him
They split up
Martin walks off, the happiest we've seen him
Bob and several others from the muscle-to-fat crew play a drunken scrimmage with a papier-mache table ornament footbal that is coming unwound
Bob quarterbacks and begins to recite a long, complicated, and forgotten play
Martin approaches from behind Bob and glides through the ad-hoc line-up, continuing down the hall
Bob yells "hike" as he stares after Martin, distracted
Bob's rushed upon and sacked
He lets the papier-mache ball drop and crack on the floor
- Martin walks down a silent, deserted hall of lockers and classroom doors
The only sounds are his footsteps and the echoed strains of Iggy Pop's "Wild Child" from the distant gym
He stops at locker number 1963 and flips the dial: Right- back left-right again
It opens
He pops up the steel false ceiling in the empty locker, fishes his hand in the opening, and withdraws what he is looking for: an ancient joint
He holds it up and examines the now brown and dried reefer
He grinds it into dust in his hand
Debi comes out of the gym and starts down the hall, the music changed for the better
- Martin senses he is not alone
He turns to find Bob Destephano
The big man holds a glass unsteadily and slurs slightly when he speaks
Bob is looking sad and scary
He leans into Martin So
You and Debi
Gonna hit that shit again
Fine, Bob
How are you
Never better
Really
Bob crumbles
Ahhh
it's all fucked up
Nothing adds up to nothing
you work your whole life, day in and day out-- try to make sense of it all
One day you're twenty-seven and what do you get to show for it
You could've been a contender, huh
Bob realizes he can't even express his own tragedy without the use of cliches
Smart boy
Real smart
Let's see how smart you are with my foot up your ass
'm gonna kick your ass
Martin steps to Bob
Why would you want to hit me, Bob
Do you really believe that there's some stored up conflict that needs resolution between us
We don't exist
There's nothing between us
So who do you want to hit, Bob
It's not me
Bob slumps against the lockers, deflated
What am  gonna do
What do you want to do
want to be an actor
Then express yourself, Bob
Bob frowns, trying to think of a way to express himself
(catching him) Be honest
Bob backs up and lets out a huge, drunken caveman scream, then stops abruptly, and smiles
Later, Martin
Bob backpedals down the hallway and out of sight
Martin watches him stumble out of the hallway and bang through the doors of a stairwell, disappearing
- Bob slams through the doors and begins to stumble down the stairs
He encounters Debi, on her way up
He glances at her but does not break stride
Debi gives him wide berth, and quickens her pace up the stairs
- Martin watches the doors swing to a stop
He exhales and relaxes
Spin-pivots on his right heel, as a from a silenced pistol pierces the space where his head was a split-second before/ As he spins around, his right hand withdraws Ken's give-away pen from his kerchief pocket, pops the cap off, and drive the pen up and through the throat of his attacker-- impaled through the throat on the pen, his head snapped back
are frozen for a moment
Blood runs quickly down the front of Felix's body, off of his shoes, and on to the floor
The stairwell doors band open
Martin's head turns toward the sound
His eyes lock onto who is frozen, horrified for a moment
She flees
looks back at Dead
growing pool of blood
Looks around wildly, holding Felix up against the lockers
Above the lockers is a plastic banner proclaiming "   -   1" rips it down from the wall with his free hand, wraps it around Felix, stuffs the body into his open locker, and slams it shut
He pulls off his shoes and socks, puts a sock over each hand like mittens, and wipes up the small pool of blood
He stuffs the socks into his pockets, takes off down the hall, and bangs through the doors
-  - Martin blasts through the upstairs doors to the grandstands looking for Debi below
She is nowhere to be found
He scans the party in progress-- It is the same frame of image as the one in Oatman's office
In the middle of the floor, Terry slowly turns up to meet Martin's eyes
pulls the doors shut, and takes off down the hall
- Martin opens his locker, withdraws the corpse, and hefts it over his shoulder
- Brick-walled, darkly lit, and narrow
Martin bounds down the steep steps with his load
- Martin hustles toward a cage door in front of him
He kicks through it and dumps Felix into a canvas laundry cart on casters and begins rolling
- The door bangs open and light pours into the room from behind Martin
He negotiates the cart over the dirt floor and stops next to the furnace that heats the swimming pool
He pauses and looks to the ceiling: the music from the reunion pulses into the floor above him
Martin picks up a large metal bar and works open the door on the hulking cast-iron furnace white-hot blaze roars within
- The party is winding down
harried-looking Martin walks in and looks around once more for Debi-- nothing
' of the Deejay booth
It is empty
He moves over to the bar and joins Ken Aldridge
He motions to the bartender who opens a beer for him
Have you seen Debi Newberry
Nope
They both look around at the last of the reunion
The more things change, the more they Goddamned well stay the same
guess
Before Ken can get started again
Take care of yourself, Ken
Thanks for the pen
Martin walks out of the gym
- Paul is leaning against his Beemer, having a smoke
What the hell happened to you
was catching up with Bob Destephano
As long as you had a good time
Beat
Martin scans the lot for sign of Debi
What now
Chase the girl
There is a beat of silence
Nothing seems worth saying
It didn't work out
That's too bad
have to get my head back into my work
Work's good for the soul
Martin gets up to leave
When you see Debi, tell her 'm sorry
See you in ten years
Paul watches him leave
He almost stops him, but thinks better of it
'  - Martin hunches over his briefcase that lays open on the bed
from the briefcase
It's seal is broken, but the contents remain enclosed
He withdraws the package and dumps the contents on the bed
His face registers muted shock
Dumb fucking luck
include various photos of
, Mr
Newberry with Debi, and the house
The photos are mingled with official- looking papers including credit reports, medical records, etc
Newberry's life
He cocks his head toward the door anticipating a
He freezes, then plucks a gun tapped under a desk, and moves toward the door, pointing
Halfway to the door, his face and body slacken
He lobs the gun onto the bed
With everything gone wrong, there is nothing left to defend
He goes to the door and opens it, body relaxed, expecting a bullet
Debi moves past him into the room
She is completely calm
He was trying to kill you, right
Yes
Not the other way around
No
Is it something you've done
It's something  do
Beat
Professionally
Beat
About five years now
(stunned) Get the fuck outta here
Seriously, when  left,  joined the Army and took the service exam
They found my psych results fit a certain profile
certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it
was loaned out to a - sponsored program
It's called "mechanical operations
" We sort of found each other
You're a government spook
Martin says nothing
was, but no
yes
was before, but now 'm not
It's irrelevant, really
The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway
But 'll tell you something, until about five months ago,  really enjoyed my work
Jesus Christ
Then  started losing my taste for it
Which usually means your time is up
But then  realized it was something entirely different started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was
meaning to life
Okay
Great, Martin, that's just great
Meaning to life
Mmm
Like, that there's a point
An organic connection between all living things
Let me help you along, Martin
You're a sociopath
(defensive) sociopath kills for no reason kill for money
You never could have kept this from me
was leaving
That's probably a good idea
Will you come with me
'm staying here
What if  come back
'll hide
She goes for the door
Don't go
She stops at the door
Slowly, she turns
You don't get to have me
You are a monster, 'm a human being
We're not going to mate
You don't understand
That's because  speak human, and you speak monster
Debi bolts out of the room
Martin is left alone
Martin looks over at his gear on the bed
After a beat, he walks slowly over and surveys his tools
He picks up a cleaning rag and begins to go over the weapons, absently singing to himself
"What's up Doc
What's cookin'
What's up Doc, are you lookin'
'  - Morning light comes through the slit in the curtains, picking up four or five exquisitely clean guns are laid out on the bed, almost geometrically spaced
Martin lifts one at a time, checking their bores and actions
- Lardner and McCullers gear up
They each finish loading the last of many clips
- Grocer and Company, not in a Ford Passenger Van, veer off onto an exit ramp
Grocer has assembled a team of about nine
They draw different guns from their kit bags and begin loading
- Lardner and McCullers jam clips into their service autos and knock the slides
'  - Martin finished loading his guns, and puts them in his case
He shuts it and moves for the door
On the way out he stops and looks himself in the mirror before exiting
- Each car whooshes by camera, on its way to the inevitable
- Marcella has a cordless tucked between her shoulder and ear, and holds a two-gallon gas can
She moves from room to room pouring gasoline onto the computers, desks, and piles of paper stacked on the floor
She adds a splash to her copy of "Women Who Run With the Wolves
" 'm bringing down the office now
She picks up her hard drive and smashes it on the floor
It's cathartic
- 'll put things right
Then 'll find you
Silence on the line
(apprehensive) Uh
why
Martin finishes his weapons check, and pulls out the dossier
Don't worry
left you a little something under your desk
Martin hangs up
Marcella goes to it and pulls loose from underneath a shrink- wrapped brick of $100 bills, probably a $100,000 or so
All right
' Martin makes his way down the road to the Newberry's
In the distance, he sees a lone figure jogging on the shoulder, away from him
'  - Grocer and Company are parked off to the side, watching Newberry, in the distance, jog toward them
prepares to blow Newberry's head off
'   - As he approaches the figure, he recognizes it as Newberry, he accelerates
'  - Grocer spots Martin's car speeding at Newberry
Oh shit
- Newberry stops jogging and turns to face the Town Car bearing down on him
His face goes slack, expecting to be creamed
- Martin roars straight at Newberry, his engine shrieking
As the distance between them turns from yards to feet
Martin swerves hard, just missing Newberry and comes to a halt next to him, blocking the Sniper's line of fire
After a moment, Newberry opens the passenger door
What the fuck is the matter with you
Well,  was hired to kill you
It's what  do, and come to think of it, told you that, but
Okay
'm not going to do it
Get in the car
He does
They drive on
It's either because 'm in love with your daughter, or because  have a new-found respect for life
Or both
But  don't know
'  - Grocer and company watch in amazement
'
of Martin's car disappearing into Newberry's long and wooded driveway
That punk is either in love with that guy's daughter or he has new found respect for life
Let's go
- Martin pulls up in front and stops
Both men scramble out and head toward the front door at a quick clip
Newberry is shaken; Martin seems at ease, at home in his element
Why
build cars
They're paying you to kill me
Why
It was a cost-cutting effort
They can't afford a recall
It was a leaky sunroof
design flaw
reported a leaky sunroof
You want to kill me because of that
It's not me
Why does everybody think it's personal
They go through the front door and shut it behind them
'  - Grocer drops the van into gear and heads toward the driveway
- Lardner and McCullers approach the scene
They get within viewing distance in time to see Grocer's Town Car turn into the driveway
We'll go in through the woods
Martin's briefcase is open on the large oak table
The contents of the dossier are spilled out onto the table
Newberry and Debi watch him, dumbstruck, as he draws a huge Desert Eagle automatic and jerks back the slide
He turns to Debi
was sitting in my house on prom night wearing that Goddamned rented tuxedo, a corsage in one hand, a bottle of champagne in the other
So was just sitting there, and then the whole night flashed before my eyes, and it struck me like a bullet in the head--  realized, finally, and for the first time, that wanted to kill somebody
So  figured because  loved you so much, that'd it'd be a good idea if  didn't see you anymore
But now 'm different
He turns and points the gun at the front door and  two shots through it, leaving two baseball-size holes in the door
Martin bolts out of the room toward the back of the house
Debi and Newberry run as fast as they can away from Martin
Newberry opens the front door, preparing to rush out with Debi
They stop at what they see: ' & '
As  lies on the porch, shot dead through the door by Martin
one hand is a gun, in the other is a Fuller Brush kit
Two men,  and an , clamber out of van, their guns rising up fast toward us
Debi pulls Newberry inside, slams the front door, and locks it
They dive away just before ten rounds hit the door from outside
- Martin rushes toward the back door which is already opening
barrel comes through and  at Martin
Martin pulls back behind the refrigerator and returns
An comes through the door in a crouch and takes cover behind the cooking island
Martin, yelling back to Debi
'm in love with you
know we can make this work
rushes toward the island, grabbing an iron skillet off the range, and holds it up like a crossing-guard stop sign
He steps toward the hidden Assassin just as the Assassin rises The skillet takes two rounds before Martin hammers the Assassin's head with it
Debi and Newberry arrive in the kitchen
- Martin bashes the skillet into the Assassin's skull, which is beyond our view
He rises spattered with blood and looks at Debi
was afraid to commit to a relationship, but now  know 'm ready to make it happen
Martin drops the skillet and grabs Newberry and Debi gently be the wrists
just need time to change
He ushers them past the bludgeoned corpse and up the back stairs
He spins and  twice back down the stairs at another  coming up, blowing his arms off
He leads them quickly
It's not easy for me
was raised to close off, to control my feelings
He takes them into a bedroom, and  , an coming in through the window, emptying his auto
Martin pushes Debi and Newberry into an adjoining bathroom
He backs out through the doorway
Lock the door
They do
Martin starts away, but stops to get something straight
wasn't raised in a loving environment
(beat) But that's not an excuse
It's a reason
Martin corners the banister and springs half-way down the stairs, then hears the front door begin to open
My soul was empty-- Martin jams in another clip, and chambers a round
He sees Grocer beginning to slip in
--and it's up to me to fill it
Martin  the twelve-round clip into the door until the slide locks back empty again
Grocer backs out fast
Martin hears a gun  from upstairs and moves back toward it, tossing the spent weapon
An  slams his body against the bathroom door while Debi and Newberry scream from within
Martin flies at him
The Assassin wheels on Martin
Martin pivots out of the line of fire, still moving forward
He takes hold of Assassin's neck and snaps it
Martin drops the corpse
(through the door) It's okay
It's Martin The door begins to open revealing Debi and Newberry
know what  do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving
(
) Don't listen to him, he's a professional
Martin stops short and cocks his head toward Grocer's muffled voice coming from the vent
Grocer continues
(
) You're breaking my heart down here, Blank
can't shoot through the tears
Martin, incensed, bends down and takes the gun from the dead man
He runs out of the bedroom, gun poised for a kamikaze firefight
- Lardner and McCullers are poised outside the front door, about to enter the mix
McCullers peers through the window
Did you see Blank in there
No
Good
For a second there  thought we were in trouble
- reaches the top of the front stairs to find Grocer heading up the stairs at him
They lift their guns at each other to , when they hear
power through the front door, guns  at floor-level, ala Butch and Sundance
Martin and Grocer, above, spin on them instinctively, and , killing them
Grocer dives off of the stairs and rolls out of view
- heads up the back stairs
works his way toward Grocer, moving with stealth toward the kitchen
hears him and starts back down
Martin dives behind the cooking island just as Grocer comes out of the stairwell blasting
They unload at each other as Grocer runs a pattern across the kitchen,  at Martin, crouched, who  back
Grocer vaults himself through the air toward a serving window from the kitchen to the dining room, still firing
- '  - The last casing floats out of the chamber into the air, and the slide on the auto locks back-- empty
Flying through the air disappearing through the shuttered serving window, his flight carrying him past a television that sits on a lazy susan
- Martin and Grocer sit on the floor, backs up against opposite side of the counter-- Martin in the kitchen and Grocer in the dining room
The hulking old television sits on the counter above and between them
Martin looks up and spies the How about  sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece
Okay
Martin takes out a checkbook, and tears one free
He wads it into a loose ball and tosses it over the counter
sails over the television and comes down, bouncing off Grocer's head and into his lap
There you go
left it blank
Excellent
Here they come
Grocer pulls two rounds from the clip of his semi-automatic and pushes the clip back into the gun
Grocer arcs the into the air
rises and springs at the television, gripping it
The sail past his head
begins to rise from his side of the counter, cocking his gun
puts all his weight and motion behind the television
Martin and the television careen off of the counter toward Grocer
gets off one round before flies onto Grocer, smashing the seventy-five pound television over his Goddamn head
Martin sails past the collision, landing on his back in the dining room
He rolls over to see Body crumpled, neck is snapped, head encased in the shattered picture tube
He is dead
runs up the front stairs, retrieving the spent gun he discarded earlier, and heads into the bedroom
- Martin opens the bathroom door
Inside, Debi sits on the edge of the tub, her face in her hands
Newberry kneels with his arms around her
Martin takes this in, and walks back into the bedroom
Newberry stands and follows him out
a bloody, tattered mess, wipes off the gun and puts it into Newberry's hand
Newberry, in total shock, grips it
Martin looks past Newberry
'
Of Debi, head in hands
(
) Debi
will you marry me
Debi doesn't look up
After a moment, she reaches out, head still down, and closes the bathroom door
- Outside is a Michigan autumn
Debi sits at her console, bringing in the mike as she fades out of a tune
This is  Radio Free Newberry cause that's what it does
Bringing you New Ones for the Nineties, a fresh new format designed to pull you out of what's come before, and reel you into what's coming soon-- lights up with an incoming cal
tell you what's coming soon for me, or at least what  dreamed this morning in that weird time just before you actually wake up
But first this commercial
Back after this
She pushes a couple of buttons, slaps a cartridge in a player, and answers the phone
We hear the commercial over the studio monitor: Don't miss the show of the season at Bilkin Community Center
"Brigadoon
" musical for all ages
"Brigadoon," starring Carol Plummer, Thomas Canchola, Bob Destephano, and Lee Ordman
Debi picks up the phone
Her face goes slack as she listens
not good, not bad
Then she hangs up slowly
The commercial ends
moment of dead air, then she snaps to
Hey out there
Okay
'm going to finish up that fantasy later
First 'll give you an hour of nonstop music
If  don't come back on after that-- well, nevermind
Debi turns on a reel-to-reel, and leaves
- Debi pulls up and gets out
She begins toward the door but stops dead when she sees sitting on the front steps
Debi moves slowly up the walk and sits next to him on the porch
They sit, gazing out over the grass and trees beyond
After a while
This will never work out
She turns to him, serious
You kill people
(beat) have no illusions about the future
What is, is
We make choices
And we become the sum total of our choices
can live with that
Other people can't
Martin looks at her earnestly
And smiles ever so slightly
She does the same, and then just a little wider
He the same
They turn back out to face the lawn, and they share a laugh
