: Written by David  Goyer & James 'Barr : - / heavy mist hangs before us - endless and impenetrable
And out of that primordial fog a  materializes, flying toward the camera in slow motion
(
) believe there's a place where the restless souls wander
Burdened by the weight of their own sadness, they cannot enter Heaven
Presently a second shape materializes - a
warrior whose baleful eyes shine behind the familiar irony mask war paint
(
) And so they wait, trapped between our world and the next, endlessly searching for a way to rid themselves of their pain - in the hopes that somehow, some day
The figure on horseback sweeps past us, disappearing once again into the mists of time
(
) they will be reunited with the ones they love
: ,   - Present day
The Crow settles on a shipping container, tilts its head, watching
: "   -  29TH -     " tearing open a tiny glassine envelope filled with powder - our drug du jour - Trinity
The face of the envelope has been stamped with an image - a cartoon imp with a shit-eating gring giving us the thumbs-up sign
lowers his face to the envelope, snorts up the powder
The man discards the glassine envelope
as it flutters to the ground, landing "imp-side" up
Let the rush begin
Garbage-poisoned waters wreathed in fog
Although once part of a thriving shipping industry, decades of decline have seen these docks become a hellish dumping ground
Case in point: are kneeling next to one another at the end of a pier, their arms linked together, then tied behind their backs (8) is quietly sobbing
(late 20s), tries to calm the frightened boy
'm sorry, Dad
'm sorry
didn't mean to look
It's okay, Danny
It's okay
(
) Lights
bright light comes on
Ashe and Danny turn their heads to avoid the glare

) camera

) action
Ashe and Danny's executioners, , , , and
, a post-modern sleaze-hound, circles Danny and Ashe with a camcorder
He Pats Ashe's face
Make-up
, lean and gangly, crouches next to Ashe, holding a marigold in his hand
Flowers for the dead, Senor
(  ' ) Ashe stares directly into the camera
No
Suite yourself, then
Spider Monkey tucks the flower behind his ear
Danny is praying now,  a Catholic School litany
You're wasting your breath, angelito
Nobody up there's listening
We cut to an extreme high-angle shot - God's omniscient , perhaps
leans up against his motorcycle a few yards away - big, burly, shaved head, a ciggie hanging from his lips
He's got a custom paint-job on his pearl drop gas tank - a buxom blonde doing the "wild thing" with the Grim Reaper
Curve's also the one who just dusted himself (hyped on drugs) Let's get this over with
Judah's waiting
Kali, a cold-eyed heavy-metal femme with a killer's casual stoicism, is methodically loading bullets into her revolver
She's taking her own sweet time, in defiance of Curve
There's a tension between them
Finally, she flicks her wrist, snaps the revolver shut
Kali walks up to them
'm scared, Dad
know
Ashe turns to his executioners, pleading with them
Listen to me, please
He's just a kid
Let him go
He can't hurt you
He doesn't even know who you are
and puts a bullet through Danny's chest
Ashe
Danny's body slumps forward, dragging Ashe down next to him
Ashe stares into his son's lifeless eyes
Curve saunters over, stares down at Ashe, flicks his cigarette butt off into the water
Nothing personal, sport
Guess you were just in the wrong place at the wrong time
Curve  a gun into Ashe's back
As Ashe crumples
Dump 'em
Let's get this cluster-fuck on the road
motions to Kali and Spider Monkey
Together, the three of them heave Ashe and Danny into the ocean
Bon voyage, shitheads
- Ashe and Danny sink down into the murky underworld, taking their place amongst a thousand other deep-sixed dreams
' falling further and further away from the light of the surface world
Bit by bit, Ashe's struggles subside
All we hear now is an ever-slowing
Darkness begins to close in around us, womblike, peaceful
, something takes shape - a
Winging its way from Ashe's dream-like death up through watery depths into a smog-bound cityscape
- The Crow flies over a bridge with spans the Styx - the city's polluted, man-made river
rides the thermals above an urban sprawl riven by fires, floods, and earthquakes
Smog hangs in the air like an army of ever-present ghosts
We pass over a roof where someone has painted a smart-ass welcome mat for the benefit of anyone flying overhead - " "
Nevertheless, we continue on
(
) They say that time cancels pain
don't know about that
Eight years ago  lost two of my best friends
Two thousand miles later find 'm still living in the past
sweeps down into man-made caverns of pigeon-shit concrete and grimy glass
Through the bird's eyes we glimpse the city's silent Automobile hulks littering the streets like insect husks
The shifting searchlights of police helicopters
' The Crow circles downward
(
) Every night when  close my eyes the dreams come
That's how the dead talk to us,  guess
In the dark, when our souls are off wandering
'  - The Crow lands next to an open window
It perches on the edge, looking into the loft
(
) just wish  understood what they were telling me
'  () , early 20s, lies asleep in bed
She stirs, troubled by uneasy dreams, rolls over, opens her eyes
' ,   - As Sarah rises the Crow flits away like yesterday's memory
Sarah's not sure whether or not she dreamed the bird
, the cat Sarah inherited from Eric and Shelly, is perched on the end of the bed
Hey, Gabriel
Sarah gives the cat an obligatory behind-the-ear scratch, then climbs from bed, making her way across the loft
' is furnished in thrift-store treasures
The loft has an earthy warmth to it, in stark contrast to the urban decay outside - an island amidst a sea of unrest, dominated by an arching half-circle window through which Sarah can view the local wildlife on the streets below
' Turbulent oils reminiscent of history's brooding symbolist painters
Give Sarah's childhood inspiration, the subject matter is no real surprise
a work-in-progress
The painting depicts a woman resembling Sarah being cradled in the arms of her pale-faced lover, surrounded by a sea of watchful dead
reaches the shower, strips off her clothes
Her back and upper arms are decorated with graceful tattoo work - a pair of black angel wings sweeping over her shoulder blades
She's got a ring in her navel, another in a nipple
In short, the skate-waif we knew back in Detroit has matured quite a bit since that fateful Devil's Night
Sarah shuts here eyes, turns her face up into the spray
For a brief second we see a flash of
,   - Ashe's death
Plunging into the icy waters, down into darkness
Just as suddenly we are back in
'  - Sarah's eyes snap open
She holds a hand out to the shower wall, takes a moment to collect herself
Troubled, Sarah climbs from the shower, shrugs on some clothes
Among her accourterments is a necklace featuring a silver ankh, the symbol of eternity
As Sarah sites in front of her vanity we catch sight of the irony mask that used to hang by Shelly's mirror
Next to the mask is a
Once Shelly's
There's an inscription inside - ""
Sarah fingers the ring a moment, glancing at the irony mask
Lots of memories
Lots of ghosts
Gabriel creeps up,  forlornly
() Me too
She threads the ring onto her necklace, letting it fall next to the ankh, then slips the silver chain over her head
Sarah stands, pulls on a jacket, heads out
' ,  - An ill-wind kicks up trash and grit
Sarah glances down
Dozens of the glassine imp envelopes swirl around Sarah's feet like confetti
One of the envelopes has stuck to her heel
As she peels it off, she catches sight of
in a shadowed entryway
It's a   (16), strung out on drugs
The girl cowers in a narrow stairway, hugging herself, shivering from withdrawal
Sarah draws closer, notices some of the grinning imp drug sachets at the girl's feet
The girl shies away, frightened, suspicious
() Nice place you've got here
(a muttered whisper) No place else to go
Sarah can't help but recognize a part of herself in this lost soul
Gotta name
Grace
So what
Listen, Grace, how does some hot coffee sound
Maybe a little food
What do you want
Nothing
Guess you just remind me of someone  used to know
After a moment, Grace offers a reluctant nod
Sarah helps her from the entryway, into the warmth of the dying light
Grace blinks, shields her eyes
As they walk away down the street, camera rises up to include
perched on a nearby rooftop, watching them
: - the Gargoyle is an usassuming ink shop - the sole oasis of light in an otherwise desolated block populated by derelict warehouse buildings
Flickering neon  in the window
Nearby is a battered road sign - "  "
Someone has spray-painted "   " over "city limits"
In the distance, the bridge of the River Styx rises through the mist like a skeletal dinosaur
: " 30TH -      " - a sparking tattoo "gun", the needle  as it travels over a patch of Vaseline-smeared skin
(
) Almost finished
Doing okay
(
) Yeah, stings a little
(
) That's why they call me the Mistress of Pain
Sarah expertly guiding the needle, wearing glasses, surgical gloves, concentrating
Sarah's buzz-headed  sits in a ratty dentist's chair
Sarah is finishing coloring a Japanese dragon which winds its way over the man's forearm
She makes another line of color then sits back, smoothing more Vaseline over the man's arm
She picks up a jeweler's loupe, makes an adjustment on her needle
Behind Sarah we glimpse the cluttered tattoo shop - walls covered with sheets of flash (ready-made art), bookshelves crammed with reference works
Sarah's partner, , a chain-smoking proto-punk Brit, consults with a
- Noah is closing up shop, while Sarah sterilizes some needles in an autoclave
What a downer - this kid wanted me to tattoo "If you're reading this, you're too close" on his bleedin' bum
Sarah smiles
Noah fires up a fag, flops down into a dentist chair
The two slip into a familiar, good-natured banter
Christ, 'm knackered
Beats pushing ink in Detroit
That it does, Princess, that it does
() Oh,  bought you a little present
Noah reaches into his shirt pocket and pulls something out
It's a handmade candy sugar skull with a little strip of paper glued to the bottom - a fortune
They do 'em for the Day of the Dead
(tossing the skull to Sarah) Nice, huh
Necrophagia, Princess
Eat the dead
(reading fortune) "Life is just a dream on the way to death
"  like that
Sarah studies the skull, then pops it in her mouth, nodding
Noah rises, stretching
Want to grab a beer, then
No,  gotta go home
Haven't been sleeping much lately
So, what's the dirty dog's name
've just been having some weird dreams
() You ever dream that you're dying someone else's death
Outside we hear a  pulling up, then someone on the front door
(calling out) Sorry, we're closed
appears outside
He  harder on the door
Open the fucking door
stands, moves to the door
Look,  said we're
Curve kicks open the door and storms in
He  Noah in the nose, then heads straight for Sarah
You think what you did to me is funny
Some kind of joke
What are you talking about
'm talking about the fucking tattoo you gave me
took off the bandages
Look
Curve rips open his shirt, revealing his chest
' It's a crow, rendered in bold slashes of black
Or is it
Upon closer examination the crow looks like something else - two demons fighting
The design is a classic ambiguous figure - like the picture of the woman in front of a vanity which can also be seen as a skull
crow
Damn right, it's a crow
And did  ask for a fucking bird on my chest
Did
Sarah shakes her head
Then what-the-fuck is it doing there
don't know,  was just going from the design you gave me
Curve backhands Sarah across the face
Noah rushes forward, blood still running from his nose
Stop it
Curve pulls an automatic from his waist-band and points the gun at Noah
Noah freezes
What's it going to be, hero
Ready to kiss your faggot-ass good-bye
think so
think you're shitting yourself you're so goddamn ready
Curve snaps open an imp bag of his favorite drug, snorts up the contents
He presses the gun against Noah's forehead
(
) Over here, ass-hole
As Curve turns, Sarah squeezes a bottle of tattoo ink into the killer's eyes, blinding him
Agh
Sarah plants one of her Doc Marten boots in Curve's groin
He , doubles over
Sarah pulls the automatic from his grasp and trains it on him
Get up
Curve cups his balls, slowly rises
His eyes are glowing with manic intensity
slow smile creeps across Curve's face
He backs away towards the front door
Shoulda killed me while you had the chance, sugarplum
Be seeing you
Curve smashes his fist into the neon sign, then ducks out thedoor
Moments later we hear his motorcycle  to life
He takes off, away into the night
Sarah lowers the gun, takes a deep breath, looks to Noah
You okay
Noah wipes his bloody nose, looks to the floor where Curve discarded the drug sachet, shakes his head in disgust
Fuck me, wonder what they'll be snorting next
Sarah shakes her head, at wits end
just can't do this anymore
'm so tired of this
Noah pulls Sarah toward him, gives her a big hug
Easy there, luv
It'll all work out
, - Sarah, still clutching Curve's gun, hurries to her Galaxy 500 which is parked along the nearby train tracks
'  - Sarah moves behind the wheel, dumps the gun on the seat, and rests her head in her hands
As Sarah raises her head
'  ( ) The Crow is perched on the hood of her car
Sarah  her horn in frustration
The Crow doesn't move
,  - Sarah rushes out of her car, screaming at the bird
Get out of here
Go
Sarah  a wild shot into the sky
The Crow files off into the night
Sarah collapses against the hood of her Galaxy and starts to cry
: - The Crow soars away from the Gargoyle, toward the beckoning lights of Downtown
In the distance, a flashing " " sign draws our attention to a monolithic tower
' ,  - The Crow makes its way towards the decaying tower, which is crowned by a weather-worn campanile
The campanile is a complex arabesque of rusted iron scrollwork, like something Antonio Gaudi conjured up from an art nouveau fever-dream
Just as the Crow is about to reach the campanile, it banks away
We, however, continue to rush onward, right through one of the dark openings in the scrollwork
' ,  - All we see is black, then some vague, shiny reflections
to reveal a stag beetle, imprisoned within a box, leashed to a nail with a piece of thread
We were tight on its shiny carapace
The beetle strains at its leash, moving in a perpetual circle around the nail
over the side of the box
Although mere inches in height, this enclosure might as well be the Great Wall as far as our little member of the Coleoptera is concerned
we see crime lord Judah Earl's lair in all its sepulchral glory
Dark, filled with shadows
The decor is a cross between ruinous palatial splendor and a SoHo industrial art installation
The upper reaches of the campanile are laced with a spiderweb network of steel girders
Look close enough and you might see  bound to the supporting pillars, like the half-glimpsed shapes crouching at the foot of your bed in the middle of the night
draw our attention to an area partitioned off by chain-mail curtains
towards a break in the curtains
We linger there for a tantalizing moment
(
) Talk to me, Sibyl
Tell me what you see
(
) see Death returning from the veil of tears
He has your name on his tongue
Now we plunge in through the curtains
The "camera" consists of a series of lenses and mirrors which project images from the outside world onto a circular table, offering the ultimate voyeuristic view of the crumbling cityscape
stand with their backs to us, studying the camera's view
The first is
, sinewy, slash-mouthed Byronic figure with a guttural voice
Old before his time, touched by childhood visions of his own death
The tower is Judah's prison in more ways than one
, Judah's blind oracle, waits by his side
Attractive, though of indeterminate sex
His/her dour features are hidden beneath a black cowl
() It's finally beginning, isn't it
What mask will Death wear, can you tell me that
see the face of one of your victims
Judah lifts his head up and we see his luminous amber eyes for the first time
kind of madness dances within them
All my sins remembered
: '  - Sarah sits in bed, cigarette burning in one hand, a half-filled wine glass in the other
She turns out her light, looks to the window and the cityscape beyond - as if the answers were lying out there in the steam-cloaked streets
: ' -
Performers flaunt their flesh on a raised stage
and writhe as one on the dance floor
Lots of rubber, latex strap bodices, Victorian hoop skirts - it's a modern-day De Sade's wet-dream
on Curve as he pushes his way upstairs and through the tangle of flesh
He pulls up to a bar, takes a seat alongside Kali and Spider Monkey (who's amusing himself with a Viewmaster)
, - we see '  - as the 3- tableaus rotate into position , a barrel-chested Samoan, sets a drink down in front of Curve, nods a greeting
Curve sits back, opens his shirt, nudges Spider Monkey
Spider Monkey, what's this tattoo look like to you
This a test
Come on, man, just tell me what you see
Spider Monkey inspects Curve's chest
bird
() Think about it a minute
Don't you see two demons
Nope
see a bird
Ah, fuck you, then
Curve lifts up his beer bottle
from within the beer as the amber liquid rushes towards us
: - Air bubbles escaping, blood
Ashe is drowning again, the orbs of his eyes bulging outwards
Over this we hear a ' and
'  - Sarah bolts up in bed, knocking her wine glass to the floor, it
She's choking, gasping for breath
Her heart is hammering within her chest
ohgodohgodohgod
Suddenly she catches sight of a shadow on the wall before her - a   slowly spreading its black wings
Sarah turns to the window
The Crow is perched just outside
What do you want from me
The Crow , then takes flight
Calm now, realization and a sense of purpose dawning
: ,   - We descend towards the empty docks, pushing out into the mist-shrouded water, then down into the ocean's murky depths
come into view, caught up in a tangle of razor wire
' Unaltered by the ravages of time
His eyelids flicker, dreaming
escapes, flowing down his cheek
We push on We see brief   of he and Danny together
'  - / () Danny stretched out on the floor of their garage, painting a picture
Danny and Ashe rough-housing, having a water fight
Danny sitting in Ashe's lap as Ashe reads aloud from a story
() "
midway through our life's journey  came to myself within a dark wood where the straight way was lost
" Danny asleep, curled up next to his father
Ashe reaches out and strokes Danny's hair
' His dead eyes suddenly open
Confusion
Pain
Fear
stream of bubbles rushes from his mouth, obscuring our view
' As the bubbles clear, Danny's face comes into focus just a few inches from his own
Ashe panics, jerks back
The razor-wire barbs cut into his flesh
The more he struggles, the tighter the coils become, slashing his hands and face, shredding his clothes
He's caught in his son's embrace, the two of them thrashing about in a grotesque underwater ballet
: - The headlights of Sarah's Galaxy cut through the fog
She pulls up just in time to see the Crow disappearing into the mist which cloaks the bridge
Sarah follows, trying to keep up with the bird
: - Ashe's struggles become more and more violent
He thrashes, churning up a cloud of bubbles
We are intercutting quickly now, between Ashe's turmoil and

She climbs from her car
flies on ahead, landing atop one of the piles, staring down into the water

of subjective POVs
The killers walking down the jetty, marching Ashe and Danny to their deaths and

) makes its way to the water
Camera   from beneath the jetty to reveal Sarah standing there in silhouette
- Ashe is propelled towards the surface
- Ashe suddenly bursts from the sea with his arms outstretched
hellish Venus on the half-shell
Gasping, full of terror and rage
He lets loose a
digs his fingers into the wood-rot pulp of the pilings and claws his way up to the jetty
He collapses down onto the wooded slats
crouches before us, his face hidden from view
He reaches out his hand, touching an unmistakable
Danny's blood stain
This triggers more painful memories
,   - Images from Ashe and Danny's execution assault him
Kali her gun
Ashe
Danny's body slumping forward like a marionette whose strings have been severed
: ,   -  () Ashe lifts his head,
He's covered from head to toe in ocean-bottom silt
Blood from the razor-wire wounds has smeared across his face in patterns which eerily recall the Crow make-up
Strips of the wire still cling to his arms and chest, the barbs buried deep in his flesh
Reliving the violent moment is more than his mind can bear
Ashe's eyes roll up into his head
The world spins around him
But even as the lights are going out, Ashe glimpses
standing in front of him
It's the last thing Ashe sees before consciousness escapes him
emerges from the shadows, staring down at Ashe in wonder
: : " 31ST -   " '  - Ashe opens his eyes
The mud-silt which covers his face has dried and cracked, causing it to crumble away in flakes
Ashe is lying on a cot in the middle of the loft
We see scattered images: candles burning, a reilgious altar overflowing with trinkets, mirrors, mannequins, canvases, and finally
perched at the end of the bed, watching Ashe intently
sits on the other side of the loft in a paint-smeared work-shirt, brush in hand
She's studying a half-finished canvas, contemplating her next move
The eerie scene depicting a woman on her death-bed being cradled in the arms of her ghostly lover
Sarah tenses, feeling Ashe's eyes burning into the back of her neck
She turns around, sees Ashe
() who are you
My name's Sarah
had a dream about you
saw them shoot you and your son
() saw you drowning
Ashes shuts his eyes a moment, trying to recall the imagery
,   -  () Curve  a gun into Ashe's chest
Ashe crumples and we are back at
'  - Ashe looks down at his chest, tracing his fingers over the area where bullet holes should be
Instead, he finds a series of indented welts
How did  survive
Sarah suddenly comes to the terrible realization that Ashe does not know he has died
(coming towards him) You didn't
Ashe looks up at Sarah, uncomprehending
You're dead
No
Ashe stands, enraged
He starts toward Sarah
She backs away
Stop looking at me that way -- stop looking -- this isn't real, none of this is real
'm dreaming this
(shaking her head, frightened) No
The two of the struggle a moment, Ashe pushes Sarah back
Sarah reaches for him, trying to restrain him, trying to somehow keep his rising terror in check
she's not getting through to him, he can't be made to listen
Finally, Sarah grabs a kitchen knife from the counter and plunges it into Ashe's chest
Ashe gasps
He stares down at the incongruous sight of a knife-handle stickout out from his sternum, then he yanks the knife back out
No pain
No wound
moment of shock, then
(looking at her, a tortured whisper) 'm dreaming this
Sarah tries to reach for Ashe again
He tears away from her, flinging her back and running for the door
'  - Ashe stumbles from the doorway out onto the sidewalk
He rushes blindly up the street
- from the fleeing Ashe to Sarah's window
On a pillar outside, the Crow is waiting
'  - Sarah rushes to the window, watching Ashe run
She  the Crow perched below her
It takes wings, flying after Ashe
: / - Beneath the arching span of a freeway bridge is a series of corrugated iron sheds
as Ashe, exhausted fro his run, makes his way towards them
The Crow flies on ahead, landing next to one of the doors, beckoning
Ashe slides one of the  doors open
- As light spills in, we catch a glimpse of the humble auto repair garage - tools, a few wrecks-in-progress, a motorcycle
a tempera painting on the floor that's been executed on construction paper
brush and a collection of paint canisters are scattered around it, like the kind you might find in a primary school art class
Ashe kneels next to the painting
An image rendered by a child's optimistic imagination - a crude father and sone, respectively labeled "" and "" mars the otherwise perfect memento
Ashe touches the figure labeled "", which triggers
-  () Ashe is working beneath a car
Danny is sprawled on the floor
He holds up the painting in question
Hey, Dad
what color should  make the sun
Blue
There's no such thing
() No
Well there should be
Just then we hear a  coming from outside
(wide eyed) What was that
Danny climbs to his feet, moves outside
Danny, wait
Ashe slides out from under the car
-  () From the back doorway, Ashe and Danny catch sight of Curve and his crew executing someone beneath the freeway overpass
Curve's face is splattered with blood
He turns and sees them
See no evil
,   -  () Now we're back at the pier
The memory flashes are coming faster and faster
Danny is sobbing once again
' 'm sorry, Dad
'm sorry
We see Kali raise her gun
There's the muzzle flash
Ashe ' Nothing personal, sport
: -  () Ashe is tearing the place apart, sobbing, knocking over racks of tools
Finally, he sinks to his knees, his face a mask of tears
Ashe spins, murderous rage in his eyes
Never startle an animal, right
stands in the doorway
Why are you here
don't know
She stops herself -- she does know, she just didn't want to admit it to herself
want to help you
need to
Sarah approaches, dropping by Ashe's side
She sees Danny's painting which Ashe cradles protectively
Ashe looks up at Sarah, his eyes full of questions
Everything's so confused
(anguished, touching the drawing) Danny
He's not here anymore
Sarah draws closer, touched by Ashe's inner struggle
She reaches out to him, drawing him into her arms
He stares up at her, eyes distant
There's no moon
Sarah touches Ashe's face, calming him, trying to reach through his pain
You've been given another chance, Ashe -- to put the wrong things right
Sarah's eyes drop to the canisters of paint which have been scattered nearby
She reaches for the canister of white and unscrews the lid, dipping her fingers inside
Sarah's re-creation of the irony war mask has an oddly ritualistic feel to it
Yet the act is also quite erotic, for the mutual attraction between these two battered souls is almost palpable
As Sarah continues to speak, she begins to paint Ashe's face using Danny's art supplies
We see this transformation in bits and pieces - an eye here, fingers dipping into the canister of white there, ruby lips being smeared with black
the face that is taking shape is both similar to and different from Eric's
It's the legacy of the Crow, as funneled through Ashe's own, unique pain
believe there've always been people like you
Sarah has finished
She sits back, surveying her work
It's the pain that brings people back
It makes us strong again
'  as he turns towards us
slash of light illuminates the signature black and white war-paint of the Crow in all its glory
Ashe looks like a dark saint
: - Ashe rockets beneath the gothic arches of the freeway overpass on his motorcycle, hellfire burning in his eyes, his coat flapping behind him like a fallen angel's wings
flies alongside Ashe
lands on a telephone wire, studying the warehouse
Presently we hear Ashe's  approaching, then we see the front wheel of his bike pulling into the foreground
'  () Ashe turns to the Crow, slyly giving the bird the thumbs-up sign
'   - -, -, -
a sheet of glassine drug bags as a hand-powered printing press comes down, mass-producing the image of the imp giving us the thumbs up
the lab set up in a maze of barrells
The walls are stained from the toxic fumes
Blacked-out windows sweat with moisture
There are heating mantles rigged with flasks and condensers, vacuum pumps - along with ingredients like battery acid, paint thinner, and Epsom salts
Nearby are dozens of 50-gallon drums containing the finished product
Spider Monkey is working away at the printing press, pausing to snoot some of Judah's drug
Nearby is an old  featuring lurid videos of amateur bull riding - we watch as a drunken participant gets gored
Suddenly the power in the lab goes out, the  screen sputters and goes dark
Ono
(
) 'My mother was accursed the night she bore me and  am faint with envy of all the dead'
Spider Monkey whirls around, startled
Ashe is sitting cross-legged on one of the tables, grinning like a black leather Buddha
Tell me, Monkey
Does the corpse have a familiar face
Who the fuck are you
You have to learn to look beyond the mask
Ashe jumps down from the table, walking into the light
Spider Monkey's eyes widen in recognition
No way, man
we put you under
you and that little snot-nosed kid
Ashe dips his hand into one of the 50-gallon drums
He blows a handful of the Trinity dust at Spider Monkey
Spider Monkey, terminally spooked, reaches back to the counter behind him, searching for something
Looking for this
Ashe holds up a pistol and puts it to his head
(an evil grin) Don't try this at home, kids
puts a bullet through his own forehead
His head snaps backward and his body collapses onto the floor
Spider Monkey creeps forward toward Ashe's body
springs from the ground,  Spider Monkey against a table of chemicals
Bottles  on the floor, spilling their toxic contents
What are you
What the fuck are you
Ashe leans in so he's eye to eye with Spider Monkey
wasn't sure at first
Now  know
'm the boiling man, Monkey
'm the plague of Darkness and the death of the first-born
All your nightmares rolled into one
Ashe removes a wooden match from his inside coat pocket
He scrapes his thumb-nail over the head, igniting it
Whoa
this shit's flammable
Look, look, what do you want
The others
Who are they
Nemo
Kali
Judah
And Curve
'll start with Nemo, then work my way up the food chain
Where is he
Nemo
Nemo's an old gash-hound
He hangs out at the Peep--Rama on Deacon Street
Ashe blows the match out
Congratulations, monkey
You just bought yourself a fighting chance
Ashe reaches into his coat pocket, pulling out a deck of cards
He fans them out, points
Pick a card, monkey
Spider Monkey slowly extends his hand, half-expecting Ashe to pounce on him
He pulls a card out
Spider Monkey tosses the card down, face up
He's got the Jack of Hearts
he smiles tentatively
Ashe pulls out a card of his own and flips it around - the King of Clubs
Lady Luck's a bitch
Ashe produces another wooden match
Aw, Jesus, c'mon, man
You're wasting your breath, angelito
Nobody's up there listening
as Ashe scrapes his thumb-nail over the head
'   - An  rips through the front of the lab, spilling roiling out into the street
The blackened windows in a emerges from the raging conflagration, walking right through the flames, indifferent to the heat
flurry of the tiny glassine drug bags swirl around him like snow
spirals down from a telephone wire, landing atop the handlebars of Ashe's motorcycle
lifts his head to the night sky, laughing
His clothes are still smoking
: - Sarah is working at one of the drawing tables
Noah is mixing pigments
' She's working on a rendering of Ashe
She sits back
and all the world will be in love with night
Do you believe in fate, Noah
() Seeems to me it's more a question of fate believing in you
Sarah rises, reaching for her bag
As she heads for the exit, Noah reaches for the sketch
He smoothes it out, studies the image awhile as we
: '   - The demolished building is still burning strong
Curve arrives on the scene, dismounting his motorcycle
as he studies the shattered glass which litters the asphalt
The fire is reflected in the fragments
With a growing sense of dread, Curve looks from the glass to the tattoo on his chest
He touches the Crow tattoo
- Now we see that the glass shards have fallen in an array that is anything but random
The shards have taken the shape of a large crow

Judah looks up to him
Bad news
Illuminate me
Someone torched the lab on Manchester
Spider Monkey's a fucking crispy critter
Monkey  could care less about
What about our merchandise
total loss
(
) He left a sign, didn't he
Judah looks to Sibyl who is standing nearby
(rising, uneasy) don't know what you're talking about
Yes you do
You've seen it
Sibyl points an accusing finger at Curve's chest
You've been marked
(even more agitated) Jesus Christ, Judah, why the fuck to you listen to her
Because she speaks the truth
Judah rises swiftly from his chair
He snags a handful of Curve's shirt and rips it open, revealing the Crow tattoo
What's this, Curve
beauty mark
Your enemy wears the mask of the Crow
The bird of ill-omen
Judah as the words sink in
He strides across the floor, sweeping aside one of the curtains surrounding the camera obscura
The Crow
Death's avatar
've heard the legends
looks down at a view of the seething landscape
Let him come, then
: --   - The Peep--Rama occupies an old Japanese movie house
geisha-girl sign flashes over the marquee
Beneath that is a blinking neon eye which opens and closes
Other signs offer enticements like " 25
" and " " As Nemo approaches, a laconic  with a throat microphone sits outside, reciting his tired schpiel
Tokens for the buddy booths, live girls
Tokens for the buddy booths, live girls
Nemo hands the Hindu a twenty
- Nemo enters a cramped booth, clutching a handful of tokens embossed with the Peep--Rama eye logo on them
There's a seat, a box of Kleenex, a phone, and a grimy Plexiglas window with a metal shutter over it
Nemo starts popping tokens into the slot next to the window, pockets the rest of them
With a  the metal shutter rises, revealing a  in a garter-belt get-up perched on a stool
In a forgiving light, she might even be beautiful
An  display starts counting down from sixty - the seconds remaining on the metered shutter
Nemo picks up the receiver
You got a name
Holly Daze
Do you want me, baby
need to see some sugar
Holly shrugs out of her bra, plants her scuffed-up high heels on either side of the window, runs her hands up and down her body, utters some tired-ass
Right on, sister
Nemo unbuckles his belt, drops his drawers
(eyeing his endowment) Mmmm
Is that for me
Yeah, we're gonna celebrate Christmas a little early this year
Keep doing that, honey, you'll go blind
: --   - Holly is still
Over on the  display, Nemo's time has just about expired
Time's almost up, lover
Better hurry up with those tokens
Shitfire
Nemo fumbles with his pants, scoops out some more tokens
Too late, the shutter is already closing
Nemo feeds some more tokens into the slot
Nothing happens
Nemo punches the  display
Come on, fucker
The shutter starts rattling up again, only this time
is standing on the other side of the Plexiglas
His mouth splits into an evil grin
"Do you want me, baby
" Nemo's eyes just about pop from his skull
You
Me
Ashe slams his fists through the Plexiglas window, reaching for Nemo's throat
--,  - Nemo comes flying out the booth door
He struggles to rise and cheesy   drifts out from the other booths
(o
s
) Hey, mime boy
, the Peep--Rama's corpulent manager, is cradling a sawed-off shotgun
He blows a blast into Ashe's chest
Ashe starts toward Zeke, unfazed
Zeke moves to fire again
Ashe snatches the shotgun from the fat man's grasp, smashing him in the face with the butt-end
Zeke falls back into a video display, sending an avalanche of porno tapes raining down on top of him
Seizing the moment, Nemo rushes for the exit
Ashe spins, pumps the shotgun, blows out one of Nemo's kneecaps
Nemo collapses on the floor, wailing like a child
Ashe strides over to him
One crow sorrow
He  Nemo through a glass display booth filled with sex toys
Ashe punctuates each line of the nursery rhyme with a new assault on Nemo
two crows joy
Nemo starts dragging his broken body across the floor
He finds himself face to face with an anatomically-correct blow-up sex doll - the kind with a built-in pre-recorded memory chip
Ooh, oh baby,  like it like that
You're so good
You're so good
Three crows a letter, four crows a boy
Ashe  Nemo back the other way, sending him  into the front counter
Peep--Rama tokens go flying, bouncing and spinning every which way
On one side of the coin the eye is open, on the other it's closed - this creates the illusion of the eye blinking
Five crows silver, six crows gold
Nemo utters a half-sob and rolls over, feebly wiping away the blood which is clouding his eyes
Seven crows a secret never to be told
please, please just stop
Ashe pries open Nemo's eyes with his fingers
You killed my son, Nemo
You took away the only piece of light left in my soul
We had to
Judah's orders
Never leave any witnesses
We didn't have a choice
We always have a choice
Ashe plunges his fingers into Nemo's eyes - killing him off-camera
He lifts up his now blood-covered hands and turns
Just then, Holly Daze bursts out into the hall
She sees Ashe and , certain her number's up
Ashe grabs her by the wrist, spinning her around
() no
Ashe touches her face and sees a split-second  of
Jump-cut bump and grind, -, , the distorted faces of men leering with their hungry eyes, tongues and sweaty palms and heavy breath and  wanna be your fucking dog, baby, and
shuts his eyes, reeling
Ashe looks up at Holly - one victim to another
His eyes burn a laser beam into her soul
If you value what you've lost, you'll walk away from this place and never look back
Holly Daze nods with conviction
Ashe releases her
She bolts like a rabbit flushed from cover
: -- - Curve   on his motorcycle, followed by Kali and a car-load of
The team grab their weapons, head for the porno shop
Inside
Kali leads the crew of killers into the porno shop
But Curve stops, sensing something
He spins around
is sitting atop one of the cars, watching him
--,   - Kali and Curve move down the dark corridor
The from the vid-booths continue their  , but one voice in particular stand out
Nemo
' Ooh, oh baby, you're so good
' at the end of the corridor, lounging in the arms of the sex doll which is still repeating its tinny refrain
Nemo's neck has been snapped and his head hangs at an awkward angle
oh
Oh yea, that's the spot
Do me, baby
Do me
There's a folded piece of paper shoved into Nemo's mouth
Curve pries it out
The paper unfolds like one of those snowflake cut-outs we used to make in grade school - only this cut-out is of a crow
Written across the paper crow are the following words: "     " phone on the wall is
and
Finally, Curve leans in, snatches up he receiver
' Do you know what they call a gathering of crows, Curve
At the sound of Ashe's voice, Curve's eyes widen with fear
' murder
murder of crows
Think about it
The line goes dead
Furious, Curve tears the phone from the wall,  it across the porno shop
: / - Ashe exits a phone booth, leaving the receiver dangling nearby, followed by the sound of
Ashe turns and sees

The children have tied a plastic skull mask to the dog's head
The skull dog trots up the street towards

The doors are open - there's a path of marigold petals leading up the front steps
The skull dog trots up the steps and enters
- Ashe moves into the sanctuary
He watches from the rear, entranced

At the altar is a lavish offrenda - an offering of food and drink for the wandering dead decorated with sugar skulls and floral garlands
Amidst the decorations are photos of departed loved ones
There are tiers of candles surrounding these, scores of them
An   emerges from a confessional, looking to Ashe with a raised eyebrow
"Next
"
Can  help you
'm sorry, Father,  was just watching
Our doors are open
The Priest moves to a candelabra and lights some tapers
What is this for
Dias de los Muertos, the Days of the Dead
We light the candles for our loved ones - so that they might find their way back to earth and share in the pleasures of the living
Ashe watches an   place a toy motorcycle in front of a picture of a child
Tomorrow night we will celebrate
The people will dance, sing
(indicating Ashe's makeup) many will wear masks
Why
Some spirits linger here too long
They become confused, mistaking themselves for the living
They have to be frightened away
The priest nods to Ashe and moves down the aisle to the next candelabra
is watching Ashe from one of the back pews
He clutches a striped ball
He drops it
The boy rolls the ball across the floor to Ashe
Ashe kneels and catches it, rolling it back
The boy smiles
Santa Muerte
Unnerved, Ashe retreats out of the sanctuarly, letting the night's shadows swallow him up once more
: '  - Sarah sits by her paintings
Gabriel suddenly stands, arching his back, hair standing on end
appears on the ledge of the broken window, crouching there like a gargoyle in silhouette
(hesitant, but relieved) You came back
Heaven wouldn't have me and Hell was afraid 'd take the place over
Ashe drops into the loft
needed to see you again
Ashe moves towards Sarah's paintings, pausing to study the one of the woman being cradled in the arms of her ghostly lover
He touches the woman's face
She looks like you
After a long moment, Sarah responds
paint what  see
Ashe approaches Sarah
He points to the wedding ring which hands from her neck
Were you married
It belonged to a friend
Where are they now
better place
Sarah turns the ring around her finger, fidgeting with it
What about you
Danny's mother left after he was born
She was a drug addict
() lost my mother the same way
Small world
Sarah reaches for a cigarette and lights up, taking a long drag
Ashe notices a number of scars on her forearm, possibly some track marks
Sarah catches him looking, self-consciously pulls her hand back
(meeting his gaze) left Detroit because  wanted to put the past behind me
() The problem is,  know how it ends
Blood
Violence
don't want a part of it anymore
Gabriel approaches Ashe
He crouches, runs his fingers along the cat's back
What happens to me when  finish what 'm supposed to do here
You go back
What if  don't want to go back
Sarah looks away
Then you're damned ' ,  - We're watching the tape documenting Ashe's death
We see Ashe's face sinking beneath the water's surface
The image freezes
(
) It was him
It was that son of a bitch we dumped off the pier
know it
Judah, Curve, and Kali gathered around the monitor
Sibyl waits nearby
Curve is snapping open an envelope of Trinity, sniffing up the contents
thought you killed him
shot him in the head
He's a ghost
No such thing as ghosts
() Then who killed Spider Monkey and Nemo
Curve starts pacing, growing more apprehensive
All  know is, he's fucking with us
The Crow's his symbol, right
That means 'm marked
It means he's coming for me now
thought you said you didn't believe
Curve turns on Kali, furious, ready to strike her
In a flash, Kali has one of her katanas out
Curve backs away, bristling
Look, you want to tell yourselves some bullshit fairytales, that's your business
But i'm not gonna sit here with a fucking target on my chest
'm going to take this motherfucker out
You won't stop him with bullets or knives
He doesn't feel pain
He doesn't bleed
Don't you see
His soul has crossed over
He's come back from the other side
Curve looks like he's going to be sick from fear
But Kali and Judah are listening intently
l So how do you stop a man who's already dead
Can you look destiny in the eye without flinching
Judah studies Sibyl's shadowed face
You tell me
stare-down ensues
Judah doesn't avert his gaze
The Crow is the source of his power - his link between this world and the next
Sever that link and he's as vulnerable as the next man
: '  - Ashe pushes through a curtain, turns towards Sarah's vanity -- the knick-knacks and mementos gathered there, then the ceramic irony mask which hangs above
Ashe approaches, reaching a hand out to trace its features
At the bottom of the mirror, a   has been tucked between the frame and the glass
Ashe pulls it free, studying it
carnival midway set on the beach, people strolling along a boardwalk, golden sand and blue skies
at the top of the picture read: "   "
've been here
Ashe stares at the picture, entranced, caught up in a moment of wistful nostalgia for the life he's lost
took Danny last summer
We went up on the bike, rode all the way up the coast
() It was cold up there
remember we could see each other's breath
Ashe catches himself, setting the postcard down
He turns his back to Sarah, hiding his face form her, overcome by emotion
Sarah stands, drawing near
She reaches out to console him, touching his shoulder
She alone, among all the souls of the world, understands the isolation that is consuming Ashe
Look at me
But Ashe won't
Ashe
Look at me
Ashe finally turns around, a sense of deep and profound loss in his eyes
Something unspoken passes between them
Sarah leans into Ashe, tentative, eyes searching
It's one of those fragile moments where things could go either way
And then
(pulling back) No
(turning away) We can't do this
The spell has been broken
Ashe starts away from her
have to finish what  started
have to find the others
know
Ashe moves to the door, hesitant, a terrible sense of longing gnawing at his heart
wish 'd met you before
Ashe nods, then turns to leave
There's nothing else to say
'  - Sarah watches from her window as Ashe strides to his motorcycle
She raises her hand up, as if to say good-bye
'  - As Ashe climbs aboard his bike, he catches sight of himself in the
Within the bakery are mountains of sugar skulls, candy skeletons, and pan de muerte (bread of the dead)
Ashe's reflection is superimposed over this morbid tableau
Ashe fires up the bike's engine
He takes off down the street
: ' ,  - Judah moves back to the stag beetle, watching its Sisyphean efforts
So the Crow is Ashe's familiar
(to Sibyl) Can his power be taken
The bird is the key, the life-force that flows within it
() The blood of the Crow
Judah whirls around, his eyes glowing with a manic fervor
(to Curve) The tattoo on your chest, who gave it to you
Some bitch down at the Gargoyle, but what's that got to do with
Judah grips Curve's shoulders tightly, shaking him
Everything, you idiot
Find her
If she gave you his mark, then she's connected to him in some way
She can lead us to him
: ,   - Ashe stands at the end of the pier, staring down into the silent waters where his natural life ended
He takes something from his coat
which Danny had been working on
It's got bullet holes in it now
Ashe throws his arms back and lifts his face to the heavens, , cursing his fate
, as seen from afar
tiny figure dwarfed by the endless expanse of ocean and sky
: - : " 1ST -    " Curve and Kali have duct-taped Noah to one of the dentist chairs - even his mouth and nose have been sealed shut
Curve lets Noah thrash a moment, then violently rips the tape from Noah's face
(frightened, gasping) Look, what do you people want
house in the country, a dog, a wife and two kids
() your fucking head stapled to my saddlebags
We're looking for Sarah
Where is she, Noah
'm not going to tell you that
Oh, but  think you are
Kali sites astride Noah
She reaches for one of the tattoo machines
She motions to Curve, who hits the treadlight foot switch
Noah eyes the sparking tattoo machine with rising apprehension as Kali moves it towards his face
a vibrating blur just a few centimeters from Noah's blinking eye
Noah tries to shut his eyes
Kali forces an eye open with the thumb and forefinger of her other hand
Last chance, "love"
() Get bent, you dried-up bitch
From behind, we see Kali lower the vibrating needle towards Noah's eye
His   split the night as we
: - Curve and Kali are leaving the shop
Suddenly Curve clutches at his chest, wincing in pain
He opens his coat, looks down at his chest
is dripping blood from its beak and talons
Curve staggers back, horrified
Kali is watching him
No
no
What is it
But Curve isn't listening
He leaps onto his motorcycle and hits the ignition
He takes off with a
Curve
It's no good
Curve is long gone
: : The following scene appears here in the script, but in the film it appears in Chapter 12
- Curve makes his way to the bar
He rips open a glassine bag of Trinity and vacuum snorts it
His eyes roll up in his head as the chemicals flow
Another wave of pain washes over him
Curve claws at his chest, falls against the bar
goawaygoawaygoawaygoaway
The  fades to a muted echo of distant
As a feeling of inexorable doom settles over him, Curve lifts his head and sees
reflected in the bar mirror, materializing out of the narcotic haze
He's wading through the ocean of bodies
In his face paint and black leather Ashe looks like he's just another part of the twisted scene
people are stroking him, brushing up against him - like they can leech off some of his morbid angel charisma
Ashe lifts his hand - he's clutching House o' Peep Zeke's sawed-off shotgun
Curve  to the floor as Ashe's shotgun blast shatters the bar mirror, taking out his own reflection
Curve rolls, climbs to his feet, starts running
The Samoan bartender grabs a semi-auto pistol, opens up on Ashe
Now some of the other   are  too
but Ashe keeps on coming, trudging through the
Bullets are  over his body at an insane rate
Ashe is a human roman candle
Nothing is going to stop him from reaching Curve, nothing
The Samoan stops firing
He takes one look at Ashe, who's still coming at them
Fuck this
He turns tail and run
- Curve comes storming out the back door like a bat out of Hell
He takes the rear stairs three at a time, spilling into a couple of back-alley
He stumbles into a pile of garbage, scatters some rats
Curve makes for his bike, which is parked nearby
He fumbles with the key, hits the starter switch
Ashe comes flying off from a second story fire escape, landing atop a car roof on all fours, popping the windows
Time's up, Curve
Fuck you, bird-dick
Curve jerks his bike towards the street and guns it
- Curve zooms by a bridal shop-sees his own reflection in the window
- Curve , turns into the Alley, tachometer red-lining
He glances behind him
The crow flies by
plunges down from the night sky, wings flapping madly, quickly gaining on Curve like the breath of death
- Ashe, in a dream-like state, races along
- Curve leans in low, trying to urge his bike on by will-power alone
He races by a warehouse, veering off the road onto the railroad tracks
, Ashe appears on the overpass, riding on his own motorcycle, matching Curve's speed
soars higher for a bird's eye view, tracking Curve's progress as it sweeps past chimneys, swerves around billboards, ducks under laundry lines
as he  along the overpass
The Crow lands on his shoulder
Ahead is a break in the guard rail
Ashe cuts sharply to the right, taking the motorcycle airborne through the break in the rail and
lands on the surface street some thirty feet below
Ashe is now just behind Curve
: '  - Sarah is back at work on the painting of the woman being cradled by her lover
Gabriel, who's lounging nearby, suddenly looks up and
the Crow lands on the skylight, staring down at Sarah, watching
There's a  at her door
Sarah approaches, looks through the peephole
Who is it
'  ( - ) Kali stands there, cradling an automatic
She's flanked by Kali  into the lock
- The chase continues
Curve approaches the bridge doing well past ninety
Abruptly, he cuts down a roadway which parallels the river
There's a chain-link running across the mouth of the tunnel
Up ahead is a hole in the fence leading down to a tunnel spillway
Curve guides his bike through the hole
- Curve speeds into the dark tunnel, splashing through puddles of water, whipping past graffiti
As he nears the mouth at the other end, Curve brakes hard,  , almost going down
' We are now beneath the bridge
It's a stone-cold dead-end
The roadway slopes sharply downward, spilling out into the concrete river bed which is filled to capacity with rushing flood waters
We hear the  of an approaching motorcycle, then an engine cutting out
Curve looks back the way he came
Ashe's siilhouette steps into view
He's on foot now, clutching the sawed-off shotgun
He lets loose a  which chills Curve to the bone
" have a rendezvous with Death, on some scarred slope of battered hill
" Ashe starts into the tunnel
His   echo off the weeping walls
"God knows, 'twere better to be deep where love throbs out in blissful sleep, pulse nigh to pulse and breath to breath
" As Ashe draws closer, his death-like face emerges from the gloom - a ghastly visage floating in the ether
"But  have a rendezvous with Death
And  to my pledged word am true
" Ashe stops some twenty feet away, grinning like the Cheshire Cat
" shall not fail that rendezvous
" Silence like knives
Ashe and Curve facing one another
Curve is tense, dry-mouthed
You think i'm afraid of you, you fucking freak
' Curve  and guns his cycle forward, rolling the throttle all the way open - a kamikaze run aimed straight at Ashe
Ashe stands his groupd, lifts the shotgun,  at Curve's customized teardrop gas tank
There's the woman doing the wild thing with Death and
' disintegrates beneath him, breaking apart into a Shrapnel skids along the tunnel walls, lies on the garbage-strewn tunnel floor in a spreading pool of blood - burnt, battered, a barb of steel sticking up from his chest
Still, Curve has one glorious, giddy moment where he thinks he's actually succeeded in defeeating Ashe, then
' as Ashe steps through the gasoline flames
Curve's elation vaporizes
Can you hear me, Curve
Curve offers a weak nod
You're going to die now
Curve tries to speak, blood spills from his mouth
Ashe places a finger to his lips
Ashe drops down, kneeling over Curve's chest
People used to put coins in the mouths of the dead
Do you know why
So they could pay the ferryman to take them across the river Styx
(reaching to Curve's ear) What's this
In a parody of a stage magician, Ashe retrieves one of the Peep--Rama tokens from Curve's ear
The embossed eye logo flashes
Open your mouth, Curve
Curve,s eyes are wide, filled with terror
He
Shhh
It's not so bad
Trust me
've been there
Curve slowly opens his mouth
Tears run from his eyes
Ashe places the coin on Curve's tongue, like a priest administering a Holy wafer
Ashe stands, grabs Curve by the coat collar
He pulls him back towards the end of the tunnel
/ - Ashe drags Curve down the sloping end of the spillway to the waters edge
want to thank you for showing me my pain, Curve
You made me what  am
As he releases Curve, letting the current carry him away
Ashe stands, tracking Curve's progress
as he floats downstream, limbs outstretched, consciousness fading fast
' stare down at him from the girders - people who have made their home in the underbelly of the bridge which stretches overhead
lets loose a cloud of marigold petals
They flutter down around Curve, swirling in the currents
the petals have clustered around Curve's body in the shape of a Crow
Curve continues to float downstream towards an estuary, borne away on the wings of the bird
- Ashe starts back into the tunnel
He pauses a moment, kneeling down, lowering his head
Whether out of respect for the dead or his own condition, we'll never know
After a minute, Ashe lifts his head again and stands
It's time to see his mission through to the end
: - Ashe is heading back from the river when he's struck by
' is seeing what the crow is witnessing - Sarah in danger
Sarah
Ashe starts to run, back toward his bike
: - Ashe is on the motorcycle, racing through the streets
He takes a corner on a skid, zipping past the Gray Gargoyle and the neighboring train tracks
: '  - Ashe pulls up on the motorcycle,  to a stop
He leaps from the bike, rushing into Sarah's building
'  - Ashe stumbles through the doorway into the loft
The loft has been trashed
Furniture turned over, paintings slashed, the ceramic irony mask smashed into pieces
(alarmed, desperately looking for her) Sarah
(
) Sarah's gone, ghost man
Ashe whirls around who had been standing still amidst the shadows, now moves from behind Sarah's paintings
Where is she
Judah's tower
He's waiting for you there
As Kali steps closer we see that she's dressed for war -- a katana secured in a black scabbard, twin daggers on each hip, a bandoleer of throwing stars
You took my son's life
() Some people are born victims
It takes two to make a murder
Kali unsheathes her katana
The blade edge catches the streetlight's glare coming in from the window
Shall we dance
Kali comes at Ashe blindingly fast
She spins and cartwheels end over end, somersaulting
As she lands, Kali shifts into Ginsu-mode, her blade a whirling blur
Ashe ducks under the blade, trapping Kali's sword arm
He twists his hands,  her arm
As Kali  , Ashe pivots,   towards the half-moon window looking out over the street
: - '  - Sarah's eyelids flutter open with a start
She's waking on the heels of a dream
to reveal Sarah curled up on the cold tile floor, a number of candles burning nearby
Sarah sits up, disoriented
Upon moving her arm she finds that it's been shackled to one of the pillars via a long chain
Sarah wastes a few moments tugging at her tether, trying to snap one of the links, but it's no good
Frustrated, Sarah looks around, trying to get her bearings
is standing a few yards away, cloaked in darkness, head bowed
Sarah didn't notice her at first
Where am
The Tower
Everyone finds their way here eventually
Sarah rises from the floor, a little unsteady
She moves towards Sibyl, reaches out to touch her shoulder
The prophetess abruptly lifts her head, causing her hood to fall back
Sarah takes a step back,
' have been sewn shut with black thread
My God
What happened to you
(
) Fate happened to her
Sarah spins
emerges from the gloom, almost as if he were materializing from the shadows themselves
Sibyl's been cursed with the gift of prophecy
She sees things that are fated to happen
() She cut her eyes out with a carving knife because she wanted to make the visions stop
Judah brushes the back of his hand affectionately against Sibyl's cheek
but that only made the visions stronger, didn't it, dear
Sibyl turns her head away from Judah, shunning his caress
've learned to live with my affliction
Don't we all
Sarah backs away from Judah, wary
Judah Earl
My reputation precedes me
() 've seen what your drugs have done to this city
() saw a need,  exploited it
It's all economics, Sarah
Supply and demand
Why did you bring me here
'm glad you asked that, Sarah
You've got a very important part to play in this little drama of ours
You see,  intend to capture the Crow
Judah draws near, devouring Sarah with his hungry eyes ,
(
) and you, my dear, are the birdseed
: ' / - Kali comes  through the window, falling down to the sidewalk below
She lands atop a wrecked car, snapping her back in two
lies on the ground, her limbs twisted at awkward angles
She , somehow still alive
' as Ashe approaches
The Crow flits in from off-screen, landing on his shoulder
Watching Kali with it's curious golden eyes
As Ashe draws near, Kali tries to rise
The most she can do is lift her head
() can't
move
Ashe stares at her, dispassionate
Kill
me, then
finish
it
Ashe simply shakes his head
You
have to
My job is to send you to hell
You're in it
Kali stares at Ashe in disbelief, her stoic warrior's mien quickly evaporating
There's no
honor in this
It's my
death
've won it
Ashe turns and starts away
Me, too
Wait
Where are you going
Wait
You can't
do this
You can't do this
But Ashe doesn't turn back
He leaves Kali in the cold, wet street, ignoring her pathetic laments
Ashe continues on to the end of the alley
lands on Ashe's outstretched hand
The Crow takes wing, lifting its way up into the night
Ashe fires up the motorcycle's engine, tearing away from Sarah's apartment in a cloud of smoke
: ' ,  - The scene resumes
Sarah stares at Judah, horrified
Why are you doing this
Have you ever read Dante's Inferno
It says that the only true path through Hell lies at its center
If you want to escape it -- you have to go further in
Judah lowers himself into a chair
When  was a boy  fell through the ice of a lake
remember seeing the sky through the ice above me, close enough to touch
The world grew cold around me
Dark
Eventually my heart stopped beating
And in that moment,  died
Judah sweeps his hand through one of the candle flames, then pinches the flame out of existence
tiny wisp of smoke trails up into shadow
Judah settles back in his chair, overcome by a memory that for him has never lost its vibrancy
half-hour later  awoke on an operating table
had returned to the world of flesh and bone -- But  brought a knowledge back with me
(tapping his forehead) Forbidden knowledge
Judah leans in close to Sarah, his lambent eyes glowing like hot coals
As Judah continues, Sarah fingers the ankh which hangs from her neck
've been living on borrowed time ever since
've always known Death would be coming for me
() see now that your friend is the one 've been waiting for
You can't stop him
You're wrong, Sarah
() There is a way to defeat Death
and that's to trade places with him
Sibyl turns her head towards the east
The Crow is coming
Judah looks back at Sarah
: - Ashe comes screaming over a hill on his motorcycle, the image of Judah's face burned into his mind
- piloted by a man in a devil mask suddenly looms up in front of Ashe
The street ahead has been cordoned off with flashing wooden barricades
There's some kind of street fiesta going on
Ashe swerves,   to avoid hitting the carriage
Ashe's bike slips out from under him and Ashe goes  into the barricades
But even as the carriage's skull-faced costumed occupants rush up to help him
Ashe is up and running, leaping over the barricades into the crowd beyond
: '  -    - The Crow lands atop the buzzing " " sign
It cocks its head, as if considering its next move, then flies toward the campanile
' ,  - The Crow enters through one of the openings in the grillework, settling on one of the rafters
' Sarah sits within one of the pools of illumination far below, still bound to the bed by the chain
Judah and Sibyl are nowhere in sight
flies down from the rafters, landing on the floor at Sarah's feet
It  at her, trying to communicate
go
please go
The Crow tilts its head as if trying to understand
(shaking her chain) steel cage on a wire and pulley system  down from above,  to the floor and trapping the bird within it
The bird  angrily, flitting from one side of the cage to another, but its efforts are futile
'  () as Judah emerges from the darkness, crouching down on the floor to study the Crow
He grins
Look who's come home to roost
: -      - massive street festival is under way with Dia de los Muertos mobbing the area
Paper "" banners are strung overhead
light strings of firecrackers
Masked in garish costumes dance,  stroll
People are holding giant papier-mache skulls on sticks along with torches and calavera placards
There are stalls offering marigolds and cockscomb, black beeswax tapers, dangling toy skeletons, mountains of calaveras de azucar
pushes through the throng of revelers, invisible amidst the carnival atmosphere
In his makeup he's just another face in the crowd
: ' /  - Judah, now carrying the cage which contains the Crow, sweeps aside the curtain of the camera obscura
He reaches up to a lever which opens the camera's lens
Moonlight shines down on the camera table
With another lever, Judah adjusts the camera's view
The camera lens is now trained on the night sky
churning landscape of night-sky coulds drifts across the table's surface, creating an eerie effect
sets a package wrapped in velvet on the camera table
He peels back the cloth, revealing a set of ornately decorated, tapered daggers
He looks back at Sarah
Do you know what these are called
Misericords
Wonderful name, isn't it
Judah removes one of the blades from its sheath, running the glinting edge along his finger
In the Dark Ages, these were used to deliver the death stroke to the mortally wounded
They were considered tools of mercy
Judah turns to the steel cage in which the Crow has been trapped
He pulls on a leather falconer's glove and opens the door to the cage
The Crow flaps his wings madly, desperately trying to strike at Judah with its beak and claws
but Judah secures his grip around the bird's throat, pulling it out
He pins the Crow to the focusing table of the camera obscura with his gloved hand
: -      - Ashe fights his way through the crowd
drunken, grabs hold of him, spins him around, dancing
Ashe shoves her aside, making his way to
' ,   - The black sky beyond shimmers with turbulent yellow thunderheads
The entry way to the tower has been gated and chained
The only way in is up
' ,   - Ashe grabs a hold of one of the ornamental statues which crowd th ebuildint's facade
He pulls himself up, starting the daunting task of scaling the tower
: ' /  - Back to Judah and the Crow
The clouds being projected onto the camera table (and subsequently the Crow itself) are rushing at an unearthly speed
The create a surreal backdrop for the Crow's frenetically beating wings - in effect, a mockery of the bird flying
Easy, little wing
It will all be over soon
'  - Ashe continues to climb
cluster of  take wing, startled from their roost
Ashe pulls back, one of his hands slipping free
He dangles there for a moment, hanging by the tenuous grasp of his fingertips
who has been lurking in the shadows, suddenly lifts her head up
(full of portent) Ashe is here
Judah grins
This moment has been a long time coming
Not for long
Judah raises the misericord up high
Sarah turns her head away as
Judah plunges the weapon down, pounding it straight through the bird's right wing
: '  - Ten stories up now
Ashe suddenly loses his handhold
He in agony as he suffers the pain of the Crow through their symbiotic link
Ashe stares down at his hand in disbelief
' Blood seeps from a stigma-like wound on his palm
'  -   - Judah plunges a second misericord into the Crow's left wing
' Ashe   again as his left hand is seemingly twisted back against his will
second stigma wound appears
He slips, tumbling to the next ledge down but catching himself on his fingertips
He hazards a look down
' Day of the Dead  crowd the streets far below
(in agony) oh God
help me
It takes every ounce of Ashe's strength to keep from letting go
He tightens his white-knuckled grip on the ledge above
Shaking terribly, trying to fight back the pain, Ashe continues to climb
He reaches up to a
which protrudes from the building's facade
The maiden's face has been all but worn bare by the harsh elements
Ashe clutches the back of the maiden in a parody of a lover's embrace
Using the statue for support, he drags himself back up to relative safety
Now Ashe is face to face with the maiden, staring into its blind stone eyes
Sarah
Ashe whispers the word like a mantra, using it to urge him on
Steeling himself again, fighting the burning pain, Ashe resumes his climb
He's on autopilot now, just trying to reach the campanile, which at this point, seems hopelessly unattainable
seems to churn and roil
storm of epic proportions is about to break
: '  -   - The Crow has now been crucified to the camera table, a misericord staked through each wing
' as Judah reaches for a third misericord
He raises it high above his head, preparing for the coup de grace
() Ashes, ashes, we all fall down
As the dagger comes down we hear
() No
: '  - Ashe Cries out a final time as a   appears on his chest,   outward
The Day of the Dead celebrants swirl around us, Judah's Tower rising up behind the mob - an unholy ziggurat built to challenge the gods
The  has been worked up into a frenzy
Everyone is singing and dancing
blasts from loudspeakers
comes   atop a small vending stall filled to the brim with flowers an sugar skulls
Time slows as a flurry of golder marigold petals flutter down around his still form
'   - The Crow is dead, transfixed by the gleaming misericords
Blood is pooling beneath black flight feathers
Judah steps back, momentarily overwhelmed by the enormity of his crime
It's done
Judah looks to the camera obscura's table
The blood from the Crow has completely covered the table's concave surface, filling it to the brim like liquid in a shallow bowl
The end result is an eerie reflecting pool
, cast by the camera lens onto the table begins to ripple and dissolve, only to be replaced by Judah's own, shimmering reflection
With a shaking hand, Judah dips his fingers into the pooling blood and begins to paint his face
swatch of blood over one eye, then a swatch over the other
long, bloody smear over his lips
The action harkens back to the moment when Sarah painted Ashe's face - a parallel ritual turned on its head
: '  -   - Judah turns towards us, his transformation now complete
We see that he has painted himself a parody of Ashe's irony mask in the Crow's own blood
watches with a mixture of mounting horror and morbid curiousity
scoops up a handful of the Crow's blood and brings it to his lips
' as he drinks, letting the overflow trickle down over his chin and neck
' his once-pallid features now glow with a kind of beatific radiance
from Judah, up and up into the darkest reaches of his tower
Judah is , laughing in the face of Death itself
: '  - Ashe lies amidst a field of shimmering glass shards and flowers
slowly gather around Ashe, craning their necks for a view of the fallen angel
' Relaxed, peaceful, even
For a moment, we aren't sure whether or not Ashe's soul has fled
The peripheral noise from the street festival dies away
We're in the eye of the hurricane now
Once again, time seems to shudder to a stop
And the only thing we hear are
Thousands of them, filling the heavens with their
Ashe slowly opens his eyes, tentative
When you're this deep in the bosom of bliss, the last thing you want to do is waken, but waken he does
'  -    ' is black with crows
And endless army of carrion-creatures, swirling madly about
Ashe sits up, stares at the crows, fascinated, frightened
Then his eyes fall to the faces of the people around him
We are in dream-time now, blurring the edges of reality
wearing a skull mask pushes to the front of the crowd
He stares at Ashe a moment, then lifts the mask from his face
It's Danny
() Danny
Ashe rushes to Danny's side, holding him tight, his disbelief overpowered by the unfettered joy of seeing his son once again
What are you doing here
It's time to go back, Dad
Ashe looks up at the screaming crows above them
Is that why they're here
() They're the souls who came before you
They're crying for the people they've lost
() Now they're crying for you
But Sarah still needs me
You don't understand, Dad
You work for the dead, not the living
Your work here is done
Ashe reaches for his son's shoulders, all but pleading with him
can't go, not yet, not now
You have to
Danny,  can't leave her like this
The  of the crows grow louder as the sky above becomes darker
shadow passes over Danny's face
He Seems Saddened
For a moment, it seems as if another entity creeps into Danny's voice
If you turn your back on the dead now, you'll be trapped between the worlds
You'll never be allowed to cross over
() You'll be alone, Dad
Forever
Ashe hesitates a moment, realizing the enormity of what he is about to do
It's an agonizing choice
have to stay
Danny nods
know
Danny reaches out to touch Ashe's painted face
() Good-bye, Dad
As Danny says his parting words, the  of the world around them come rushing back with startling clarity
Danny starts to turn away
Danny, wait
Ashe bolts up from the bed of flowers and glass
The spell is broken
Was he dreaming
No, there's Danny slipping back into the crows, the mask pulled down over his face once again
Ashe reaches for Danny, spinning him around, pulling off the mask
only it's not Danny
It's a drunken  with fucked-up teeth who's laughing his ass of at Ashe
Ashe recoils, horrified, then spins around, suddenly finding himself face to face with
standing just a few yards away, emerging from the doorway of his tower
He got the anti-Crow blood mask on his face
His eyes are glowing like twin stars and his lips are curled back in a feral snarl
In his hands, he holds one of the chains from his campanile
Judah grabs Ashe by the lapels of his coat, draging him close so they're eye to eye -- close enough to breathe the same beath -- two sides of a coin
Tell me, Ashe
Do you every get the feeling we're all just dead men on leave
(seething with hatred) Judah
In the flesh
Judah flings Ashe backwards
Ashe reaches his hand into his coat, pulling out a
45
He into Judah's chest - once, twice, thrice
Judah doesn't even stagger, he just keeps on grinning
Wisps of smoke rise up from the holes in his chest
Ashe stares at Judah, dumbfounded
What
are
you
'm your shadow, Ashe
Every angel's got a devil
Didn't you know that
Or maybe you just slept your way through Sunday school
Judah lashes out with the rope
Ashe spins and falters
Incredibly, he finds himself feeling pain
Judah follows with a series of blows, each more savage than the next, driving Ashe back
Ashe stumbles, falls to his hands and knees
He reaches to his mouth, his hand comes away spattered with blood
Ashe shakes his head to clear it
Judah kicks Ashe in the face, knocking him onto his back
but Ashe springs back to his feet
He tries to strike Judah
Judah catches Ashe's hand and squeezes tight
We hear bones snapping
Judah smashes out with his other fist, Ashe spins around and collapses
Ashe tries to push himself up by his hands
He coughs, spitting up more blood, crawls forward
What
did you do to me
've tasted the blood of the Crow and taken your power
Judah whips the rope about, snapping the end around Ashe's neck, dragging him off his feet
Judah pulls Ashe forward, crouching over him like a spider ready to devour its prey
You're flesh and blood now, Ashe
You can die like any other man
Go to hell
Already been there
And  must confess,  liked what  saw
: '  - Sarah sobs quietly, still chained to the pillar
figure suddenly appears at her side -- Sibyl
Sarah looks up
What
Sibyl produces a key from within her robes
She places the key in the lock on Sarah's manacles
With a turn of the key, the manacles fall away and Sarah is free
Sarah looks back at the blind oracle, uncertain
Why are you doing this
Sibyl fixes Sarah with her blind stare
Ashe needs you now
More than ever
Sibyl raises her other hand
She's holding one of the misericords which she extends to Sarah
Go to him
Sarah takes the misericord and racees for the end of the campanile, towards a beckoning doorway and a stairwell beyond
Printed on a grime-smeared placard nearby are the words
"    " Sarah rushes through the doorway, heedless
: ' ,   - Judah plants his foot on Ashe's chest, tightening the chain around Ashe's throat
Looks like the dead have forsaken you, my friend
Ashe clutches at the rusty chain links which bite into his flesh, choking
Look at you, bleeding like a stuck pig
Where's your precious strength
Where's your power
(drawing closer, whispering) You're nothing now, Ashe, not even a ghost
Judah rises
He grabs a hold of the chain, pulling
down the street
Ashe  as his body is dragged across the asphalt
: ' ,  - Sarah rushes into a rickety old elevator, pulling the accordion-style security gate shut
She punches the "" arrow on the tarnished control panel
With a lurch and  the elevator car starts its journey downward
,   - Judah has dragged Ashe over to the East side of the street, in front of an old movie palace
He leaps atop one of the vending stalls and clambers onto the marquee itself
shouts to the crowds below, his eyes on fire
You want death
Here he is, people
Take a good look
Even as Ashe fights to free himself of the chain, Judah loops one end of it over a street lamp
He jumps from the marquee, using his body weight to pull Ashe from the ground
is dragged up into the air, dangling above the faces of the crowd
, '  - Sarah rushes out the front entrance of the tower, into the Day of the Dead crowd which swarms below
She pushes through the mob, trying to fight her way across the street
-   - Ashe swings like a puppet from Judah's improvised hangman's noose
His coat and short have been all but torn to shreds
Judah drags down on the chain harder, lifting Ashe even higher, tightening the noose
He secures the chain on a hydrant, then strolls forward, inspecting his work
Judah circles Ashe, grinning like the cat who swallowed the canary
Now don't we look pretty
Ashe struggles, choking, causing
of Danny's that Ashe had kept in his coat pocket to fall free
It flutters to the ground, landing at Judah's feet
Judah kneels, picking it up
As he unfolds the painting, we see that it has been stained with Ashe's own blood
He tilts it this way and that -- as if he were appraising the craftsmanship of the piece
Nice
If you prick him, does he not bleed
Judah looks up at Ashe, his eyes full of crazed humor, then he very deliberately tears the painting to shreds, letting the pieces fall away into the night wind
Judah reaches for metal rod, lashing out at Ashe's bare, bloodied back
Ashe
Judah is hell-bent on beating Ashe into oblivion
With every stroke of the switch the crowd
His eyes are rolling to whites as consciousness begins to recede
' The swirling faces of the masked celebrants, with Judah front and center
Mob mentality, everyone drunk and , jeering at Ashe, the dangling fool
It's a scene out of Hell
and behind Judah, a familiar figure pushing her way to the front of the crowd
lunges forward, clutching the misericord, shoving a reveller aside
Get away from him
Judah turns
Sarah drives the misericord into Judah's eye
Judah, momentarily blinded, falls back
Sarah unlashes the end of the chain from the hydrant
falls to the street as the chain  over the street lamp
He unravels the chain from his throat and drags himself back up
Sarah, get back
Too late
Judah has torn the misericord from his eye
He rushes up to Sarah and
Drives it deep into her chest
Sarah gasps, drops to her knees, clutching at the dagger's handle
She pulls the misericord out
Blood begins to well up from the wound
She stares at her blood-covered hands in disbelief, then falls back
Silence now as the crowd begins to back away
The mood has shifted
Ashe drops by Sarah's side
She stares up at the sky, eyes wide with wonder
The crows
can see them coming
' Once again, the crows are wheeling around the ceiling of the sky
Ashe looks up at Judah, fueled by a righteous rage that's been burning since the moment of his resurrection
He rises
All reason is gone
The only think that remains for Ashe is an unbridled animal fury
Ashe launches himself at Judah, sending the villain tumbling back into a nest of scaffolding
One of the pipes punches clear through Judah's chest, impaling him
Judah hangs there, transfixed like a butterfly with a pin stuck through it
He struggles to pull himself from the piping, but even so, he's laughing hysterically
You can't stop me anymore, Ashe
You don't have the power
Ashe's eyes boil with hatred
If it were just me, you'd be right, Judah
But  have an eternity of pain to call upon
Ashe lifts his hands up, exposing his bleeding palms
And the pain gives me strength
' As we watch the stigmata close themselves up, blood drawing itself back into the wounds
Ashe raises his arms to the sky, gesturing to the crows which spin high above his head
'  - The murder of crows spirals down from the sky like a black tidal wave
They descend on Judah as one entity,  down from the heavens like a storm of razor blades
We get one final glimpse of horrified Judah's face, eyes wide with terror, before the tidal wave of black wings engulfs him
lets loose a - that all but splits the sky as the myriad beaks and talons rend him limb from limb
, Ashe returns to Sarah's side, lifting her up off the ground and cradling her in his arms
You can't die, Sarah
stayed for you
() There's a balance that needs to be kept
someone had to cross over
Sarah takes a ragged breath, wincing as a wave of pain washes over her
didn't want it to be you
Sarah looks up at Ashe, tries her level best to smile
She's at death's door now - one foot already over the threshold
Her face is pale, having lost so much blood
Tears spill down Ashe's cheeks, causing the war-paint makeup to run in rivulets
(in anguish) can't go with you, Sarah
have to stay here now
(cursing his fate) have to stay
Do you love me
Ashe nods
Sarah reaches down to the wedding ring which hangs from her neck on the chain
She tugs at the chain, snapping it apart
She holds the ring out to Ashe
Take
this
Ashe takes the ring from Sarah
She closes Ashe's hand around the ring, gripping his fist tightly
'll wait for you
Forever, if  have to
She shuts her eyes, riding through another wave of pain
Oh God
Listen
if two people really love each other
She inhales sharply
Breathing has become a labor for her now
nothing can keep them apart
(her voice fading) nothing
Ashe nods, trying to let this thought reassure him
It's the only thing he has left to cling to
' Ashe's face, surrounded by a nimbus of light
We're falling away from him
Down, down, down
And as we fall, we hear a ' Her eyes lose focus
Her head goes slack in Ashe's arms
She's gone
Ashe lowers his lips to her, kissing her one final time
Ashe cradles Sarah's lifeless body in his arms, gently rocking back and forth, tears streaming down his cheeks
And as we pull back from them, we realize that the scene mirrors the prophetic image from Sarah's own painting - the woman dying in the arms of her lover, surrounded by a gallery of skull-masked celebrants
Ashe stands, lifting Sarah in his arms
He turns to leave
slowly part for him, revealing a path of marigold petals leading away down the street
It's almost as if, by silent consensus, the crowd has come to understand what has happened here this night
moves through the crowd carrying Sarah in his arms
The people close ranks behind him and we
: ' ,   - Sibyl stands over the camera obscura
On the table's focusing surface we see the street below
is carrying Sarah in his arms, moving through the crowd of silent witnesses
nods to herself, satisfied
We see what might be a trace of a smile cross her lips
Sibyl turns and exits the camera obscura
' ,  - Sibyl approaches the table where the stag beetle is tethered
Removing a pair of scissors from within her robes, Sibyl cuts the thread which binds the beetle
, free at last, quickly scurries out of the box and across the table, disappearing into the shadows
Sibyl follows suit, gathering her robes about her and stepping on into the darkness
: -  - The same church we visited the night before
Ashe, still carrying Sarah in his arms, enters the sanctuary
The church is aglow with candles
Ashe lays Sarah's body down in front of the offrenda, folding her arms across her chest, leaving her in a state of repose
He stands, taking in one last look
As Ashe moves to leave, he sees the elderly priest he had spoken to earlier
Why are you still here
Because  have nowhere left to go
Ashe steps past the priest, moving towards the doorway and the daylight beyond
What will you do, then
(looking back) This city is filled with shadows
One more won't make it any darker
- Ashe exits the church, finding haven in a shadowed doorway
He reaches into his pocket, removing the wedding ring Sarah had given to him
as Ashe turns it over in his hands, seeing the word "" inscribed on the inside of the band
He slips it on his finger
(
) () Are you all right
Ashe looks up to see
, the drugged-out girl that Sarah helped at the beginning of the film
She's looking good now, clean of the poison that once possessed her
And damned if she isn't holding Gabriel in her arms
Long night, huh
Gabriel  to Ashe
Ashe reaches out and scratches the cat's ear
Isn't he cool
found him on the street
was going to take him home with me
You should
Looks like he needs a home
Well, see ya
She smiles at him and starts off down the street
Gabriel turns around in Grace's arms and peers back at Ashe from over her shoulder
Ashe moves out from the shadows into the steadily growing light, watching them
We see just a hint of hope in his eyes - hope that someday he and Sarah will be reunited
As we hold on Ashe's face, Sarah's - begins
(
) believe there's a place where the restless souls wanter
: - The same scene as the beginning of our film
We've made a circle
heavy mist hangs before us - endless and impenetrable
And out of that primordial fog a  materializes, flying towards the camera in slow motion
(
) Burdened by the weight of their own sadness, they cannot enter Heaven
Presently a second shape materializes - a   , galloping after the Crow
(
) And so they wait, trapped between our world and the next, endlessly searching for a way to rid themselves of their pain - in the hopes that somehow, some day, they will be reunited
As the dark rider comes towards us, we realize that it's Sarah whose baleful eyes are now shining behind the irony mask war paint
(
) with the ones they love
: - Ashe is back on his bike, racing beneath the cathedral-like arches of the overpass
As he sweeps past a concrete pillar we
: - / Sarah on her horse, galloping in parallel action
As she sweeps last a tree we
: - Ashe on the bike
Now we intercut between the two doomed lovers, each on their respective steeds
Worlds apart, and yet, somehow traveling the same road
We are intercutting faster and faster, until the sound of and the '  are indistinguishable
Until the two figures themselves begin to blur
Faster and faster and faster until we
Over the darkness we hear Sarah's final words to Ashe: ' If two people really love each other, nothing can keep them apart
() Nothing
