"Natural Born Killers", early, by Quentin Tarantino "  " - coffee shop somewhere in New Mexico
, his back turned to us, is sitting at the counter finishing his meal
We hear the
of a pinball machine being played , a waitress, comes over and fills Mickey's coffee cup
What kind of pies do you have
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime
Which do you recommend
The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste
haven't had a key lime pie in ten years
When ya had it, did ya like it
No, but that don't mean much
was a completely different person ten years ago
Let's give key lime a day in court
And a large glass of milk
Mabel turns to her right
(to someone
) Should  make that two pieces
and we see for the first time  , Mickey's wife, sitting on a counter stool next to him
Her back is to the camera as well
Nada, Rosey
(annoyed) My name's not Rosey
(points at name tag) It's Mabel
Mabel exits
Whatever
Mallory hops from the stool, walks over and grabs the  next to the cash register, then dumping out the coins on the counter, she selects a quarter
Hey, what the hell do you think you're doin'
Mallory saunters past the  playing pinball
As his eyes follow Mallory, he loses his ball
She walks to the jukebox in the back, inserts the quarter, selects a song, punches the buttons, a needle lands on a record, and a good God almighty rockabilly tune cuts through the coffee shop
Mabel brings Mickey his pie and milk
(to Mickey) She ought not be doing that
That's for Jerry's kids, not rock 'n roll
moves around to a  of Mickey
This is the first time we see him
As he takes a bite of green pie: can't take her anywhere
Mallory starts doing a slow seductive fandango around the coffee shop
She's really cooking and smoking
Pinball Cowboy and Mabel are starting to wonder just who the hell these people are
Mickey isn't paying much attention
He's too busy enjoying his pie and milk
- dirty pickup truck, sporting a Confederate flag decal, pulls up to the coffee shop
, , and , three tough-looking rednecks, pile out
Steam rises from beneath the pickup's hood
Goddamn this sumbitch is runnin' hot
'all go inside
'm gonna check 'er out
- The  of the Rockabilly song slaps Sonny and Otis in their faces as they walk inside the door
The sexy sight of Mallory doing the ubang stomp stops them in their tracks
Good God almighty
What the hell is that
That's a bitch outta hell, son
Otis and Sonny exchange looks
Take a run at 'er, kiddo
Otis heads toward Mallory
Sonny moves over to the counter next to Mickey
Miller, Mabel
Comin' up
Otis stands in front of Mallory, trying to copy what she's doing
Her eyes are closed at the moment, so she doesn't see him
Mabel sets the Miller down in front of Sonny
Sonny takes a swig, enjoying the floor show
(to Mickey) That's some sweet piece of meat, ain't it
Mickey turns from his pie and looks at Sonny
His expression betrays nothing
Her name's Mallory
The needle lifts off the record
The song ends
Mallory opens her eyes and sees Otis
Hells Bells
Don't stop now sugar
'm just getting warmed up
Otis gives her his best shit-eating grin before turning to Sonny
Sonny gurgles out a laugh
Hey,  think she's sweet on you
Otis turns to Mallory as she  him hard in the face spinning him around
Sonny spews his mouthful of Highlife
Mallory grabs the back of Otis' head and  it down on the table, cracking the linoleum
Otis buckles, dropping to his knees
Sonny jumps off the counter stool, but Mickey's hand clutches hold of his shoulder
Sonny spins around toward Mickey, loaded for bear, and points his finger at him, threateningly
Before any threat can be made, Mickey whips a large buck knife out from its sheath, and in a flash,  off Sonny's finger
Sonny's finger drops on his boot
He grabs his aching hand
Blood flows from the wound
Just because my woman's mopping up the floor with your buddy is no reason for you to join in
Mickey makes five lightning quick
The buck knife slips back into its sheath
At first, there seems to be no difference with Sonny
Finally, blood flows from the slices made in his face and chest
Sonny collapses
The -  charges out of the kitchen at Mickey, wielding a meat cleaver and screaming
Mickey whips out a
45 automatic from a shoulder holster inside his jacket and
' : Heading fast toward Short-Order Cook's face
It Short-Order Cook puts his hands to his face and falls to the ground, screaming
Mickey spots Earl, who's standing outside the plate glass window
Earl's watched the whole shebang
Earl mouths 'Fuck
' He turns and runs for it
Mickey hurls the knife through the plate glass window, which The knife  deep into Earls back
He hits the ground dead
Mickey turns to Mallory
She's sitting on op of Otis, his head repeatedly on the floor
Honey
Mallory looks up at Mickey
She gets off Otis and moves to Mickey's side
Mickey trains his
45 on Pinball Cowboy, who's shaking in his cowboy boots
Mickey aims at Mabel, who's clutching the coffee pot, crying
(to Mallory) Pick one
Mallory does eanie, meanie, minie, moe, pointing back and forth from Mabel to Pinball Cowboy
Eanie, meanie, minie, moe, catch a nigger by the tow
If he hollers, let him go
Eanie, meanie, minie, moe
My mom told me to pick the best one and you are it
She ends, pointing at Mabel
Mabel's crying
She screams
Mickey  the
45
The bullet  through the coffee pot Mabel's holding and explodes,  her in the chest
She hits the floor dead
Mickey and Mallory join hands and walk over to the Pinball Cowboy who stands in a pool of his own urine
When you tell people what went on here, tell 'em Mickey and Mallory Knox did this
Understand
Pinball Cowboy nods yes
The two killers plant a big wet kiss on each other's mouths
Then, holding hands, Mickey and Mallory walk out of the cafe
: -  - Mickey and Mallory in a flashy '68 Cadillac Coupe De Ville

You're gonna deliver two prisoners from the county jail to Nystrom Insane Asylum in Bakersfield

Scagnetti spins around and leaves the room,  the door shut behind him
Captain Squeri shouts after him

Jack Scagnetti
You wanted to see me
McClusky turns toward Scagnetti
Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case, Scagnetti
You put an end to a nightmare
The ladies of this city can get to sleep again, and they have you to thank
Thank you, sir
Dewight McClusky of the California Prison Board
Take a seat please
Scagnetti lowers into a chair in front of the interrogation table
(referring to book) This is damn good reading
'm surprised Hollywood hasn't found you
This would make a better movie than that 'Serpico' shit
McClusky puts the book down, we see the title: ' : The Capture and Death of a Serial Killer'
Author: Jack Scagnetti
McClusky sits on the edge of the table, facing Scagnetti
He lifts a file off the table, then tosses it in Scagnetti's lap
think you'll find that good reading as well
Mickey and Mallory's file
You familiar with them
Scagnetti opens it
It's the files, reports, and photographs of Mickey and Mallory Knox
Scagnetti's face lights up
Who isn't
You been followin' the news coverage
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries--- Susanville, Soledade
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards--- Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time
Very good
You do keep up with the headlines
Scagnetti nods
Look, our situation in a nutshell is, no prison wants 'em, no prison will take 'em
'm even talkin' hellholes, where the warden's as hard as a bar of iron
No one wants those fuckin' assholes behind their walls, dealin' with 'em day in, day out
can appreciate that
So can we
So the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy
And we're shippin' 'em to Nystrom Asylum for the criminally insane
Lobotomy Bay
You've heard of it
So, how do  fit into this scheme
The public loves you Jack
You don't mind if  call you Jack, do you
By all means
You're a celebrated cop
Twenty-six years on the force, a best-seller out on paperback
McClusky grabs Scagnetti's book and reads from the back cover
modern day Pat Garret
hell bent lawman with a deadly axe to grind with maniacs
McClusky lowers the book
You're a breathing icon of justice and that's why you were chosen to deliver Mr
and Mrs
Knox
We, the prison board we, knows that once you get them on the road if anything should happen, an escape attempt, an accident, fire, anything
Jack 'Supercop' Scagnetti would be there to look out for his public's best interests
see
You write the script Jack, call it, 'Showdown in Mojave: The extermination of Mickey and Mallory', whatever
Have we found our man
Hold on Scagnetti
: -    - ' : McClusky stands next to a big iron door
He on it with is fist
We stay on Scagnetti's  through this scene
Pete, open it up
'm comin' through with a visitor
McClusky opens the door and we follow him down the corridor
As soon as the door opens, we can hear a female voice singing the song 'Long Time Woman'
McClusky turns to Scagnetti as they walk
Well, Jack, 'll tell ya, in all my years with the penal institution, and 'll tell ya that's no small number, Mickey and Mallory Knox are without a doubt the most twisted, depraved group of fucks it's ever been my displeasure to lay my eyes on
mean, those two rat shits are a walkin' reminder of just how fucked up our system really is
The song 'Long Time Woman' is getting louder as they proceed
(
) Who's the song bird
Mickey's better half herself
Mallory Knox
This little lady drowned her father in a fish tank
:
- of a home aquarium with fish swimming around
Suddenly Mallory's ' head is shoved into the tank
: While the two together burned her mother alive in her bed
:
- of Mallory's  lying asleep in bed, mouth open
What looks like a gas nozzle appears at the top of the , pouring gasoline all over her face
She coughs and gags
up and we see Mickey holding a gas can
of Mallory with a lit match by her face
She tosses it in front of her
We hear the  of Mallory's mother igniting
: Still ' : (
) Why
McClusky's still walking ahead of us
Because they wouldn't give them their blessing for marriage
(
) Ain't love grand
McClusky laughs
Ain't love grand
That's a good one
Still ' : We look down from McClusky to Mallory's file in our hands
It contains her picture and lists her color of hair, color of eyes, height, weight, race, etc
Beneath that is a column which reads:
As we read the remarks, we hear a '  read aloud
(
) When pressed about the reason for the murders
patient became hostile
:
'  - Looking trashy, wild, and animalistic, Mallory's a sex machine dressed in a prison gown
She sits in a chair, looking directly at the
don't owe you an explanation
don't owe you shit
'm not here for your entertainment
If  don't tell you what you wanna hear, what are you gonna do
Throw me in jail
'm already there, you stupid pigfucker
You gonna give me some more time
've already got life
What else you got to threaten me with
Death
'd like to see you fuckin' try
haven't met one motherfucker here who's shown me shit
: Still on ' : We look up from the fill and see McClusky's leaning against a cell door
We hear somebody signing 'Long Time Woman' inside the cell
We move to McClusky, who looking into the , gestures toward the cell
Here she is
you know her, you love her, you can't live without her
Mallory Knox
We  from McClusky to the inside of the cell where we see Mallory, her back to us, singing and dancing
( ' ) - of Mallory's face singing 'Long Time Woman'
(singing) 99 years is a long, long time
Look at me,  will never be free, 'm a long time woman
(
) Hey, Knox
Somebody out here wants to meet you
Mallory just keeps on truckin'
(singing) Been workin' on the road now
Been workin' by the sea
Been workin' in the cane fields
and  wanna be free
' : We stare at McClusky and Scagnetti for a second
Then, like a bull, we charge/ straight at them
Mallory screams
We  headfirst into the bars
Mallory's flings up, looking at the ceiling, then falls backward

Don't worry about it
She does that all the time
: Mallory on the floor, still unconscious with blood trickling down her scalp
(
) Follow me
( ) - is at the end of a long corridor
McClusky and Scagnetti approach from the other end
Scagnetti's studying the files
comes up behind the two men
You duckin' me Dewight
Hey, Phil, how the hell are ya
(to Scagnetti) This son of a bitch is chairman of the prison board, but it's like pullin' teeth to get him down to a prison
The only reason 'm here now is to set him straight, and 'm on the next flight out
(to Scagnetti) Jack, this is the superintendent of the jail
Phil Wurlitzer
He's the man who's got the power of the pen here
Wurlitzer shakes hands with Scagnetti
Pleased to meet ya, Jack
read your book
'm impressed
Good work on Curtis Fox
Thanks
From now on, you'll be dealin' with Phil
He can answer all the questions you got about the arrangements
'm gonna be bidding you good luck and adieu in about twenty minutes
My flight back to Sacramento leaves  in a hour
And  want you to know, we'll all cry a river when you're gone
They all laugh
What's the travelling arrangements
Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together
So, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll come back for Mickey
And where do you keep Mickey
We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place
But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor
Who
Wayne Gayle
(surprised) Wayne Gayle
-   - , a young, energetic, commando journalist a'la Geraldo Rivera is sitting on the visitor side of the county jail visiting area
Wayne is alone and the visiting area is empty
Apparently some arrangement was made for the visit
Wayne has a miniature tape recorder in his hand and is testing it
(into recorder) Testing one
two
three
testing
one
three
over, over, over, Mickey Knox meeting
Wayne shuts off the recorder, rewinds and plays it back
It works beautifully
He hits the record button and conceals the recorder in his sport coat jacket
The door opens on the prisoner side and Mickey Knox is lead into the room by two '
Mickey's wearing the country jail blue jump-suit
He has a thick and wide leather belt around his waist with a metal ring built into each side
Long sturdy chains with handcuffs on each end are wrapped across his body and through the rings, binding his arms to his sides
His hands and feet are double cuffed
The Deputies both have their guns drawn, ready to blow Mickey in half at the slightest provocation
For a man wrapped and bound in chains, Mickey seems strangely in control of his environment
Even restrained as he is by the symbols of society (the chains, jail, guards, guns, jump-suit), he remains a dangerous, intimidating, and fascinating figure
Wayne takes in the image of Mickey
(to himself) Showtime
Mickey's roughly shoved into his seat on the prisoner's side of the glass
The Deputies move to their place, off to the side by the wall
Hello Mickey
We've never been introduced, but 'm Wayne Gayle don't know if you've ever heard of me or remember me
was one of the reporters outside the courthouse during your trial--- Everybody knows who you are
You're famous
Wayne pauses and retorts
could say the same thing about you
(smiles) want to thank you very much for seeing me
Mickey is silent
have a television show
It's very popular
Every week we do a profile on a different serial killer
You don't mind if  call you a serial killer, do you
Mickey shakes his head no
The episode we did on Mickey and Mallory was one of our most popular ones
Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy
Yes
Whose ratings were higher
Yours
How 'bout Ted Bundy
Ever do one on him
Yes
Yours got the larger Nielson share
Good
yuppie piece of shit
What 'd like to do--- How 'bout Manson
Manson beat you
Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king
We've been waiting to do a follow up episode on you for a long time
And that time has definitely come
(pause) feel it's apparent to anyone who's hip to what's going on that the prison board has thrown the constitution straight out the fuckin' window
You and Mallory may be killers, but you're not insane
You belong in a prison, not in an asylum
The prison board is blatantly railroading you into a hospital for the sole purpose of turning you into vegetables
Now some people are saying, 'So what
'  am not one of those people
If we avert our eyes while they do this to you, we give them permission to do it again whenever they see fit
Today they wipe clean your mind because they feel your actions are dangerous, tomorrow they wipe clean my mind because they feel what  say is dangerous
Where does it all stop
No response from Mickey
My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy
'm all alone on this
need your help
want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode
Now  have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue
And 'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad
The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad
have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane
You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious
But the network isn't satisfied
They feel the show needs another element
It needs you
In order to put the show on the air,  need to get an interview with you
You haven't talked to the press since your trial
Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle
We're talkin' a media event here
Every son of a bitch out the with a  set's gonna tune in to see that
We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing
At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies
Well, whatta ya say
Have you talked to Mallory about this
She won't even see me, Mickey
Now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but 'm gonna tell ya somethin'
Since you two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't spoken one word
She doesn't talk
Not to anybody
She sings
She sings
What does she sing
Songs
'He's  Rebel', 'Leader Of The Pack', 'Town Without Pity', that Dusty Springfield song ' Only Want To Be With You'
That's what  hear anyway
Her behaviour was the main thing the doctors' report used against you
So even if she would see me, which she won't,  couldn't put her on camera anyway
If  ask her, 'Mallory, are you insane
' And she starts singing 'Dead Skunk In The Middle Of The Road', that blows our whole case
Mickey cracks a smile
The guards come over to take him away
(
) Time, motherfucker
They grab Mickey, and jerk him from the chair
Wayne stands
Wait a minute, Mickey,  need an answer
Mickey doesn't respond
He just leaves with the guards
(yells after him) Just think about it
But don't think too long
'  - of Mickey curled up by his bed, writing Mallory a letter
(
) Dearest Mallory
My cell is so cold
At night  get the chills
pretend you're lying next to me, holding me from behind with your leg draped over mine and your arms wrapped tightly around me
lie in my cell
: in cell behind Mickey
We slowly  back
(
) and imagine kissing you
Not making love, just kissing for hours and hours on end
remember everything about our time
remember every joke you ever told
of the letter being written over the
(
) remember every secret you ever shared
Shared or revealed
think shared is proper
remember every single time you laughed
of Mickey, mouthing the words as he writes, we can hear Mallory's laugh - a distant haunting echo
remember every meal we ever ate remember your cooking
especially remember your casseroles
remember watching David Letterman
We hear the echo of television laughter
remember driving fast
faster, man, fast behind the wheel of the Coupe de Ville
The sound of the Coupe de Ville swells until we
: - sits on the hood looking down at Mickey and Mallory, driving fast --
hurricane of wind whips through their hair
Mallory laughs wildly as she wraps her arms around Mickey and kisses
(
) You, baby, by my side
Your bare feet up on the dash, singing along with the radio 'Needles And Pins', 'He's Rebel', 'You're My World', 'Ring Of Fire', 'Love Grows Where My Rosemary Goes', 'Groove Me'
: - Coupe de Ville parked on the road side
Mickey is in the drivers seat with his feet on the dash watching Mallory dance on the hood of the car
(
) And your dancing, my God, your dancing
lie on my bed and go over every day, every minute of our happiness
Every day take a day of our time and go through it hour by hour
don't jump ahead either
take it as it comes, and  live that day again
That way when  get to our first kiss
: - The screen erupts with fire
Mickey and Mallory's faces appear in the flame kissing passionately
(
) The killing of your parents, our wedding
They're not just memories
feel that joy again
: - of Wayne holding a piece of paper in front of his face and reading from it out loud
We hear Wayne's  over Mallory's singing before the last scene
(reading out loud) 'After taking a few days to reflect on your offer, 've come to the conclusion that you are one hundred percent correct
national  interview would be very advantageous to both Mallory and
The only obstacle is they're shipping me out to the funny farm in four days
However, that is your problem and not mine
feel confident you'll manage
Here's to us making television history
Sincerely, Mickey Knox
' Wayne drops the letter down from in front of his face
Am  a God or what
We now see the restaurant adorned with the standard Denny's decorum
Wayne's team is gathered in a booth that surrounds the remains of a greasy meal
In response to his last remark, they all pretend they are praying to him
The team consists of , the cameraman, who wears wild t-shirts (presently a t-shirt with the movie 'She Devils On Wheels' splashed on the front); , the soundman, who wears wild Hawaiian shirts and Bermuda shorts; and  , Wayne's assistant, a young lady who wears Bermuda shorts, a baseball jersey, and a dark sports coat no matter how hot the weather is at any time
Roger's never seen without his recorder, Scott's never without his camera, and Unruly Julie always has her giant notebook
These dishevelled film types are all in their twenties and are a marked contrast to Wayne's stylish yuppie demeanour
Unruly Julie pops the cork on a champagne bottle
The guys hold out coffee mugs, while Julie fills
Julie, however drinks straight from the bottle
: This scene is to be played at a rapid fire 'His Girl Friday' pace
Drink up
This is a celebration
This is the day we received word we were gonna make television history
We're gonna have the first sit down, in depth interview with the most charismatic serial killer ever, one day before he's being shipped to a mental hospital for the rest of his life
This is one of those golden moments that happens maybe only four times in a lucky journalist's career
This is Wallace with Noriega, this is Elton John confessing his bi-sexuality to the Rolling Stone, this is the tearful reporting of the Hindenberg disaster, this is Truffaut setting the record straight on Hitchcock, this is a Robert Capa photo, this is Woodward and Bernstien meeting Deep Throat in an underground parking lot, this is John Reid reporting 'The Ten Days That Shook The World', this is the hippies' bloody palms at Kent State, the Maysles brothers at Altamont, this is the Nixon/Frost interviews
This is Raymond Burr witnessing the destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla
Everybody laughs
What's the schedule, mein fuehre
As Wayne talks, Unruly Julie writes furiously in her notebook
She never speaks, just writes
We got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together
The day after that they're shippin' Mallory
That's when we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause the next day he goes
Would the network really not run it without the interview
Are you kidding
The last thing they expected was Mickey Knox to get up close and personal
They wanted a follow up episode and would've taken anything  had given them
'm not gonna tell Mickey Knox that
'm gonna make him think his grey matter depends on it
When  told Woody and the brass about this coup, they practically shit a brick
'm talkin' an adobe brick
They want to expand the show to a hour, and they want it on immediately
How immediate is immediately
Next week's episode
Wayne's team all spit out mouthfuls of champagne
We don't got enough footage for a hour follow up
(pointing at Roger) What he said
Rape and pillage the first episode, just change the order a bit
Those sons of bitches out there ain't gonna know the difference
All that shit is just filler for the interview anyway
We film a new intro
Show some old footage from the first episode so the get a brief history of Mickey and Mallory
We introduce a new angle
what the prison board is up to
We see some of that new shit, then the rest of the show is the interview
Now what's so fuckin' hard about that
Oh, Julie make a note:  need Woody to get me thirty seconds of the 'Live at Five' broadcast to promote next weeks show
We'll do a feed right from the jail while we're wrapping up with Mickey
Unruly Julie scribbles in her notebook
Wayne snaps at Scott
You too Scott, Betacam and a remote, keep it simple
Scott closes his eyes in concentration, and repeats Wayne
Betacam with remote and two-way comm link
Got it
(opens eyes) How about the interview
What camera do you want to use
Wayne closes his eyes
see
high contrast sixteen millimetre black and white, and  mean black and white, where the black's black and the white's white
This is for posterity, so fuck video
Film
Film

Wayne pounds on the table
of Unruly Julie writing in her notebook: 'Film

' So Unruly Julie's comin' with me and planning the interview
(points at Roger & Scott) You two go down to the editing bay, take the old footage and the new footage, put it together, and see what we got
Get it into shape so when we finish the interview, we can just stick it in
When do you want the assembly
Tomorrow
: : '' : - leads Wayne, who's talking to Unruly Julie
As they march quickly through the halls Julie writes furiously in her notebook
At that point 'll ask him if he believes in God
If he says yes, 'll ask him what he thinks God would make of his actions
And is he worried about burning in hell
If he says no, 'll say, 'Well, Mickey, what do you believe in
' And hopefully he'll say something like a live round of ammo, the expression on the face of a man he just split up the middle, Mallory's eyes, sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll
He's bound to say something provocative
Wayne and Unruly Julie enter the video editing room
Scott and Roger are sitting at the editing bay
Everybody is wearing, and looks like they slept in, the same clothes as the night before, except Wayne, who's in another sweater and looks alert and snappy
Okay, boys, let's have it
Well, basically, what we did was put part of the old show on first
But we changed the order around so it wasn't super obvious
Then we added the new shit to the tail
So we film the interview, and we can just slap it on at the end
Wayne and Unruly Julie grab chairs and sit
Okay, let's see it
of video monitor screen
We see a show rewinding
(
) Now we got to film a new intro for the follow up episode
But we put the intro for the first episode at the beginning temporarily so you can see it with some scope

Apparently bored with banditry and murder, the two outlaws proved what renaissance psychopaths they really are
To break up the monotony in between bank jobs, or what have you, they started butchering whole households at random

Unfortunately, the story didn't end with their capture
It just became more surreal
Their subsequent trial turned into a sick circus

They're a very mixed lot
(
) As spectators, reporters, law students, tourists, gawkers, the interested, the curious, the devoted, and the demented were drawn to the Los Angeles county courthouse like moths to a flame
'  - Wayne talks to us
The Mickey and Mallory Knox murder trial was so event filled it made the crime spree that took place before pale by comparison
The first point was the decision of Mickey's to act as his own council
Now this in itself is not unheard of, for instance, Ted Bundy acted as his own council as well
What was unexpected was how well Mickey's performance would be
'  - Wayne interviews    in his den at home
(
) We spoke with Burt Steinsma, who was the presiding judge during the Knox trial
Mickey was surprisingly effective
When  was told  was to be the judge of this trial and then  was told Mickey Knox would be handling his own defence,  got a headache that lasted five days
But at first  breathed a sigh of relief
Mickey showed up very prepared, and proved to be an excellent amateur lawyer
'  - Interview with state prosecutor  , an attractive woman in her forties
(
) However, this opinion isn't shared by the state's prosecutor on this case, Wanda Bisbing
Wayne's with Bisbing
Judge Steinsma said that Mickey showed up very prepared and proved to be an excellent amateur attorney
Oh, that's rich
Well, considering that Mickey Knox turn his court into a mockery and personally made him look like a fool, 'd say that's very benevolent of Judge Steinsma
As far as Mickey being an excellent amateur lawyer, maybe 'm old fashioned, but when  went to law school, we were taught the object was to win the case, which  did
'  - Wayne talks to us
The nation caught fire to Mickey and Mallory fever, Mickey and Mallory mania, if you will, as the merits to Mickey's talent as a defence attorney became apparent
Law students from all ends of the country converged on Los Angeles as legal history took a new course
But that was only the lemon next to the pie
And that pie is you, the American people
That pie is the way the strangely charismatic, and make no mistake, they are charismatic, Mickey and Mallory have captured the public's interest, fear, and in some cases, admiration

And you being a Harvard law student, what is your opinion of Mickey Knox's performance
Ahhh, Mickey's pistolero savvy in the courtroom trial rivals, dare  say conquers that of master Melvin Belli
He's like a magnificent loose cannon, firing point blank in the prosecutor's face

(confused) But how can you say that
They're mesmerising
Hypnotizing
Have you seen 'Pumping Iron

Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno
Yes
Through the power of the simple word--- And a snake-eye glare
---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him
He had the edge
The mind's edge
Mickey and Mallory have that edge
Only on a much grander scale
They've hypnotized the nation
Schwartzenegger was the king of the edge before they came along
The  of the brothers  back
You say this and yet
you two are both victims of Mickey and Mallory
has zoomed back to reveal that both Simon and Norman are in wheelchairs (their legs maimed or gone)
Yes
Yes
How can you say that you 'admire' them
It's like this, Wayne
Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack
These two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there
Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move
Why can't they just shake hands and be friends
They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs
So, you may as well make the first move
And they made the first move
Unfortunately, yes
But you see, that's okay, Wayne
Why
They passed the 'edge' along to us
How so
By taking away our legs
Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym
Probably the whole city
They gave us the fighting spirit
Before this happened  was content
Now 'm pissed off
Now 'm half a man and 've got to work like the devil to get whole again
But you'll never be whole again
Never is a very long time, Wayne word only the weak use
'm not a sore loser
Even if  don't have a leg to stand on, 'm going to get up and fight this world until 'm on top again
That's the Mickey and Mallory way
That's the way of the world
They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law
Survival of the fittest
One last question
Usually Mickey and Mallory kill all of their victims
Why did they let you two survive
The brothers pause, then turn to Wayne
They had us tied down during one of their house raids, you've seen the headlines, and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gonna kill us
Just for fun,  guess
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun
' Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, 'm your biggest fan
' Apparently, they've seen all our films
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune
' So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off
They actually apologized

Pope stops the movieola, turns toward the , and greets Wayne
: It is my belief that Mickey and Mallory Knox are a cultural phenomena that could only exist in our sexually repressed society
flower that could only bloom amidst a grotesque fast food culture
what  tried to do with 'Thrill Killers' was trace the root of the problem all the way down the vine to the original bad seed
Yet amidst the violence and murder and carnage, you've got the structure of a Wagnerian love story
- In a back alley, the conclusion of 'Thrill Killers' plays out
The sound of  and  are nearing
Movie Mickey, shotgun in hand, runs down the alley stopping at a dumpster, where the wounded and bloody Movie Mallory sits propped up against a brick wall

: : (
) Why did you kill Mallory
Both of them are still alive
It was dramatic license, no doubt
But felt an operatic love story needed an operatic ending
The two of them kill for each other
They offer the death of their victims to each other like other lovers offer flowers or bon bons
So what more natural, what more organic, what more poetic than Mallory offering her death to Mickey
It's where it's been leading since day one
We worked it in the movie by using a what if they escaped situation think it works beautifully
You'd be surprised
People come up to me at the end of the movie in tears

If you play her as this wild maniac, the audience never has to deal with her
If you see a decapitation in a movie, you just say 'Oh wow, a neat special effect
' Because you can't relate to a decapitation
It doesn't mean anything to anybody because it's not personal
Decapitations don't fall into most people's realm of life experiences
But if you show somebody in a movie getting a paper cut, the whole audience squirms
Because everybody can relate to a paper cut

He's a little cerebral for my taste, but all in all, we got along
- Wayne, sitting in a chair in front of a desk, interviews
, who sits behind the desk
(
) To get a psychiatric view on the strange attraction Mickey and Mallory seems to have, we talked with Doctor Emil Reinghold, noted psychologist and author
Wayne begins his interview
Can you shed some light, Doctor Reinghold, on why the public has taken a pair of sociopaths so close to their bosom
Well, for one, the media has done a tremendous job of turning the husband and wife mass murderers into celebrities
But it's the country's youth who have turned the couple into the ultimate anti-heroes
Basically, the very thing that makes them most lethal is the exact same thing that captures the public's hearts and minds -- Mickey and Mallory's operatic devotion to each other
In a world where people can't seem to make the simplest relationships work and the slightest emotional commitment is considered devastating, Mick and Mallory have a do-or-die romance of a Shakespearean magnitude
To the country's youth, 75 percent of which are coming from broken homes, that's appealing
They have an 'us against the world' posture which always appeals to youth
And they've taken that posture seventeen steps beyond
It's not 'us against the world,' it's 'we're gonna kill the world
' They're exciting
read their file and  find myself turning the page like it was a paperback
Why do disillusioned youths get into Mickey and Mallory
Why do disillusioned housewives read romance novels
Why are you filming this special
Because you know as well as do, you say 'tonight at nine Charles Manson speaks,' everybody's going to tune in to hear what he says
Mickey and Mallory have shocked a country numb with violence
They've created a world where only two exist and anybody who inadvertently enters that world is murdered

When you study the martial arts, they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you're at in your training
Am  correct on that point
Yes you are
What was the color of Tim's belt
The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't believe in belts
Is that a fact
Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in
Tim studied several styles, but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do
Jeet Kune Do
Now  did some research on that form of fighting, and  found out that Jeet Kune Do was a style developed by Bruce Lee
Did you know that
Yes,  did
That's why Tim studied it
Because it was Bruce Lee's fighting style
of  '  typing in
Now, while  freely admit total ignorance on the subject,  have heard of Bruce Lee
And  was under the impression that Bruce Lee was one of the, if not the greatest fighter in the history of martial arts
That's what Tim said
So,  think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that Bruce Lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of all times, developed for nine years, that would be a fella who could defend himself
Would you describe Tim that way, Grace
Yes,  would
Mickey points at Grace with the pencil in his hand
Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands registered as lethal weapons
Yes, they were

You're a vampire, or the devil, or a monster, or cyborg, or something like that
But you're not human

: - Mickey, dressed in county blues, is led out of the courtroom by sheriffs deputies
He's cuffed hand and leg
Reporters throw out questions, photographers shoot photos, Mickey is somewhere else, no mugging to the crowd this time
(
) After the deadly brewhaha in the courtroom, the judge, honorable Burt Steinsma, passed down a sentence that was to make legal history
'  - Interview with Judge Steinsma in his den at home
of Wayne and Judge talking
(
) We spoke with retired Judge Steinsma at his home in Baltimore, Maryland
The interview: Was there any vengeance on your part with your unique sentence
Yes, unquestionably
After they did what they did in my court, and judge worth his robe will tell you the same thing
It couldn't help but affect my decision
That's why they have judges
We're supposed to be fair to a fault, but when it's showtime, we have to make a decision
That's why we don't just input all the facts into a computer for the appropriate punishment
couldn't give them the death penalty
See, California hops back and forth on that issue
Mickey and Mallory went to court when it was out of favor, which is actually good because it leaves more room for imagination
Anybody can give somebody the chair
When you have someone who deserves to die and you can't kill them, you have to be creative
And if the bastards had let it stand, it would of been the perfect sentence
It hit 'em right where they lived
Far more punishing than the death sentence
Would you please describe for our viewers what your sentence was
Well, in a rogue's gallery of killers, Mickey and Mallory are very unique
've seen a lot of killers in my day and they're a very cold lot
They have no more feelings about taking a person's life than squashing a tiny bug
It's all the same to them
Well, Mickey and Mallory were that 'kill 'em to watch their expression change' attitude personified
Except with each other
And, since they lived only for each other,  wanted to attack that, at its very root
So, in a nutshell, my sentence was double life for each without any possibility for parole
That would be fairly standard in their case
The twist  added was that the husband and wife would have no contact or correspondence with each other for the rest of their lives
And they would never receive any word or information about the other
So, basically once the cell door slams shut, Mickey and Mallory will completely disappear from each other's life
They'll never know when the other dies
But alas, the best laid plans of mice and men
: - Mallory in tears, hysterically actually, is cuffed hand to foot, and being dragged by sheriff's deputies into the prison bus
Reporters throw out questions, photographers shoot photos, news people capture the moment on video
The bus pulls out onto the street
: : Mickey in prison uniform being led by guards
: Shot though bars of Mallory in her cell
Her back is to the camera
(
) The sentence was never to reach that point
Because after only a year, Mickey and Mallory created so much mayhem that it was decided
:   : ' ' (
) that they were mentally ill and needed to be transferred to a state mental hospital
move into the picture of Mickey and Mallory on the front page of the newspaper
: : of Dewight McClusky
(
) We talked with Dewight McClusky, chairman of the California State Prison Board, about this curious turn of events in the Mickey and Mallory case
'  - Wayne's interviewing McClusky
Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved to an asylum
And who made the decision
The prison board made the decision board of which  belong
We're the who
The why is simple
Mickey and Mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor's care, where hopefully they'll receive the help they need
Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial
'm confused
What's changed
Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail
And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates
When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people
Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone,  still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before
So, ask you again, Mr
McClusky, what's changed
What's changed, Mr
Gayle, is our minds
We felt they were competent a year ago
year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong
Who is we
The prison board and the doctors who examined them
Were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the Knoxs mental state asked to re-examine them
Using the same doctors is not common practice
take it by your answer it was a whole new team
Now that you bring it up, yes
They were different men
hadn't really thought that much about it
Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation
What do you think normally happens
The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives
The state doesn't work like that
: of
(
) The two psychiatric opinions the board sought were those of Albert Rodriguez
: of
(
) and Dr
Felix Vargus
Both of the good doctors, for whatever reason, refused to be interviewed
'  - Back with Dr
Reinghold
He's laughing
It's a funny situation actually
If anyone besides Mickey and Mallory give a damn, what the prison board is doing would be considered an outrage
The prison board is basically saying, 'We can't handle these guys
' They've moved 'em around twice since their sentence started
They were a handful everywhere they went
Now the prisons they're at now want them outta there
But no other prison's gonna be stupid enough to take 'em
So the prison board is left scratching their heads wondering what they're gonna do
Well, what they decided to do was to set up a kangaroo medical court that found them crazy
Then they get them transferred to Nystrom Medical Asylum or Lobotomy Bay as it's referred to in the psychiatric circle
Put 'em on a strict dope and electro shock diet, and Mickey and Mallory cease to be a problem to anybody except the orderlies who clean out the bedpans, which if you want to see them get theirs, that's all well and good
But there's something being said here
Forget the immorality for a second
Forget the corruption and the skulduggery involved
What the board is saying is 'we give up
' Mickey and Mallory ran amuck in polite society
They were put in an alternative society and they ran amuck there, too
All the powers that be, can't deal with these two kids
And whatever can't be assimilated has to be terminated
So, in your opinion Mickey and Mallory are not insane
Insane, no
Psychotic, yes
menace to living creatures, yes
But to suggest that they're insane gives the impression that they don't know right from wrong
Mickey and Mallory know the difference between right and wrong
They just don't give a damn
on Dr
Reinghold
- Wayne's just finished viewing the show
He puts his hands on Scott and Roger's shoulders
Good work, my brothers
Fan-fuckin'- tastic
think that interview stuff's too long, we can lose some of that
Keep the girls, keep the long hairs, keep the Hun brothers, keep the black guy, keep the movie shit, and keep the cop at the donut shop
Lose the rest
And cut the interview with the prison board fellow before that
Cut it after ask, ' take it by your answer it was a whole new team
' Don't even let him answer
Fuck him
Then cut to me talking about the two chicken shit psychiatrists and straight in Dr
Reinghold laughing
Okay
Wayne puts his arm around Unruly Julie
Children, we have a show
(to Scott & Roger) You two get some long well overdue sleep
'Cause tomorrow, bright and early, county jail and then journey's end
Mickey Knox
: : '--
' '  - Mickey's pacing back and forth in his cell, trying out different jokes
There's this Italian guy, a French guy, and a Polish guy
And they're all talkin' about how they fuck their wives--- : You know, 'm gonna just rip off your dress and squeeze your titties
Then Little Red Riding Hood whips out her
357, sticks it in the Big Bad Wolf's face and says, 'No you're not
You're gonna eat me
just like the story says
' : (with a lisp) Fairy boat
knew things were good in here, but  didn't know we had our own Navy
: So this guy wants to take little Johnny's sister to the drive-in
But the mother says, 'Only if you take little Johnny along---' : And the Polish guy says, 'That's nothing
When  get through with my Hanna,  get up, wipe my dick on the curtain, and she hits the roof
' : Mickey's pretending he's calming down a hysterical audience
No
please
thank you
you're too kind
no
please

: Everytime we're viewing through Scott's , we are filming handheld in 16mm
Until otherwise specified, the  stay in Scott's
Scott's filming the back of the newsvan
Roger's sitting in the back eating donuts as is Wayne
Unruly Julie's up front driving
(with mouthful of donut) How's it working, Scotty
(
) Perfecto
Roger's picking through a box of donuts
Scott  over to him, then slowly  in on him
Where the fuck's the chocolate cream filled
Did anyone get my chocolate cream filled
If you did, it's mine
of Roger, looking into
pointed at a chocolate cream filled
You saw me do it, didn't you
Wayne starts talking
We  from Roger to a  of Wayne
You were there
Did you see him put it in a box
We  back to a  of Roger
At the time,  was too busy explaining to Scott the finer points of film
We  back to a
(
) Yeah, right
You know what he said
He said, Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom is Spielberg's best film
Wayne starts laughing
We hear Scott laugh too
(to Roger) You can't be serious
(preoccupied) 'm as serious about that as  am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled
Gimme that other box
Huh uh
This dozen is for Mickey
That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake
Roger, no
What's the big deal
Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut--- Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means
It's important we establish a rapport
Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year
So you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled
Unruly Julie  the horn
Wayne gets up and looks out the windshield
Okay, guys, we're here
County Jail
Julie, just park in the front
Wayne--- Roger, 'm starting to get pissed
Just drop this fuckin' donut shit, and gather your gear
The van stops
Wayne slides open the panel door, and steps out
- :  35mm
Wayne hops out of the van and is approached by Superintendent Phil Wurlitzer who's followed by two
(aside to Scott) Here's the welcome wagon
Wurlitzer reaches them and shakes Wayne's hand
Hello, Mr
Gayle
'm Phil Wurlitzer
We talked on the phone
It's a pleasure to meet you
Same here
Let me introduce my crew
Scott
Roger
and Unruly Julie this is
'm sorry
What's your title again
'm the superintendent here at
County Jail
Me and my deputies are who you'll be working with while you're here
That sounds great
Look,  don't want any of this to intimidate you
This is not going to be a big deal
This is going to be very easy
(to his crew) need to talk with Mr
Wurlitzer
You guys get your equipment ready, power up the van and confirm a transmission code for the remote
Julie come with me
Julie tosses the keys to Roger and shadows Wayne as he speaks confidentially to Wurlitzer
The main thing  need is a big room, shut off from the population, so we can get some privacy
with a few electrical outlets
- Wayne and his crew have set up in the food supply room off from the cafeteria
Being big, roomy, and unpopulated, it's perfect for an interview
There's eight
County around the room along with Wurlitzer
Roger's setting up his sound equipment while Unruly Julie is checking her notebook
Wurlitzer and a few Deputies talk among themselves moves from person to person without cutting
(to two Deputies) This is just for an interview,  was on the set of 'Dukes of Hazzard' once
It was a much bigger deal than this
They had a crew of maybe seventy-five people
moves to Wayne and Scott
We're gonna be talking over here
But want enough freedom so if  wanna get up and move around, we can
Wayne grabs Scott and walks him to the left
Take him and walk him over this way
(pretending Scott's Mickey) So, Mickey, killing Mallory's parents, what the hell was that all about
(pauses--to Scott) Then maybe take him to the window
He walks Scott to the window
(pretending Scott's Mickey) So, Mickey, if you were let outta jail today, what's the first thing you'd do
(pause--to Scott) Little shit like that
don't wanna have to feel  gotta stay in the chairs
We're after a cinema verite, anything can happen, truth twenty-four times a second kindda feel
End of single
Wurlitzer's talking with Deputies
And when it's lunch time, they don't just go to McDonalds
They got cooks there servin' great food
Swedish meatballs
Wayne walks over to Wurlitzer and Deputies
How's everything coming, Mr
Gayle
Everything's coming along just fine
Phil,  wanted to know if  could have a small word with you
By all means
Wayne puts his hand on Wurlitzer's shoulder
They walk around the room
You met the kids  have working for me
Great bunch, aren't they
Oh yes, indeed
Top flight
Scott, genius cameraman, Roger, magician with sound
Unruly Julie, could sooner do without my arm than Unruly Julie
Is that her real name
Just a little nickname
Yep, they're my kids and they're all  need
After working together these past coupla years, we're like well-oiled machinery
No, more like a Formula race car
No, scratch that one, too
What we're really like is a Swiss watch
Small, intricate, compact
it shouldn't work as well as it does, but it does
Because of the craftsmanship, the expertise, and the artist's loving hand
Wayne gives Wurlitzer a moment to digest this
see
Now, Phil,  don't know if you've ever been on a set before--- (proudly) Ya know,  was
(acting surprised) Really
was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago
(still acting surprised) Well
small world
Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things
Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members--- Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more
See what  mean
It's a funny business, isn't it
It sure is
They got a asshole over here
(pointing to his left) asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there
(points to his right) asshole perched up there
(points straight up) Assholes everywhere
Hey, maybe if we were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang stuff we'd need all those assholes, too
What we're about is intimacy
We're about two people having a conversation
Say  was interviewing you
All  want you to worry about is what  ask you
want a trust to develop
If you're thinking about all this
(indicates the hustle and bustle of a set) you're not going to relax, a trust won't develop, we'll be talking a each other instead of to each other, there will be no chance for intimacy
Wayne gives Wurlitzer a chance to take this in
That's why my crew is only three
an invisible three
(switching gears) Which brings me to what  wanted to talk to you about
have to get Mickey Knox to relax
Mickey Knox to share what he's never shared before
Mickey Knox to open doors which 'till today have been closed
Well, how can we expect him to do that when we got Los Angeles County Sheriffs up the walls
Suddenly, things get short between the two men
(snorts) Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do
Lose 'em
Mr
Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is
Mr
Wurlitzer,  assure you,  am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career
They're out and out angry
Since he and his wife have been in custody, they've killed--- Don't recite the fact to me
'm sure know 'em better than you do
Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know
If  were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig
One
can take care of myself grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and 've handled some pretty rough customers in my day
Mickey Knox doesn't scare me
Two
'm a journalist, and 'm prepared to take that risk
Three
it ain't gonna happen
Believe me when  tell you, it is in Mickey Knox's own best interest to play this game according to Hoyle
(pause) Wait a minute
We've gotten into a advisory relationship here, which is not what  want
(pause) But seriously, Phil, look at this
Wayne scans the room, counting the deputy sheriffs
(counting) We got one
two
three
four five
six
seven
eight
mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too much
Let's lose some of these guys
Wayne, if it was anybody else--- Phil, 'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place
They hate him
He hates them
What kinda intimacy am gonna create with all this hate in the air
Even you and  feel it
What are we talking about
Two guys
Okay
'll take two guys off
No, no, no, no, no, no,  mean only two guys
can't do that
Five guys
Three
'll cut it in half
Four guys, but that's it

Knox

The echo of Mickey's cell door makes her up with a jolt

Mallory springs out of bed, and into a fighting stance

The deputies are  and Beautiful day for a drive, isn't it
: - of Mallory's bare feet walking in front of Bingham and Washington's shiny black shoes
The  of Mallory's bare feet slapping the concrete floor, along with the clip-clop-clip-clop of the deputies' shoes, reverberates throughout the scene
Mallory walks slightly ahead of the two shotgun wielding deputies, when Scagnetti slips in beside her
He lights up a cigarette with his Zippo, and talks a long drag
It's a long trip to Bakersfield
Long and hot
Ever been to Bakersfield
Mallory looks straight ahead
See, 've been there twice
And 'm not lookin' forward to goin' back
But 'm in and out
You, on the other hand, sweetheart, are gonna spend the rest of your life there
Now that's what  call cruel and inhuman punishment
Mallory shows no emotion, just keeps on walking
Course you're not gonna give a shit
'Cause when the good doctor's get through givin' you the zap
(he puts his finger next to his temple, pantomimes being electrocuted) You won't know where the hell you are
They'll just put you on a window sill, and water you every other day
Mallory lets out a big yawn
- Wayne stands at the window speaking to Scott, Roger and Unruly Julie
One the other side of the room Wurlitzer and his entourage of deputies are yucking it up, and occasionally bursting into laughter
(to his crew) And when he gets here, its no dick'n around time
Make him up, clip a mike on him, then leave him alone
don't want you talking to him
don't want you getting in his face
want you hiding behind your gear
You are invisible

Mickey is shackled head to toe, it's a wonder how he can still walk

Wayne's team disburses
Okay, boys, lets start undoing him
Two deputies hold shotguns to Mickey's head, while two others start unlocking the chains
As they do, Mickey looks at Wayne
Wayne approaches Mickey

All right, Mickey
Let's discuss it when 'm unbound

Washington unlocks the cuffs around Mallory's wrists
Mallory's silent
Scagnetti leans up against the wall, smoking his cigarette
Turn around and face the wall
Mallory does
Bingham and Washington move to the door
Wait outside for a second, fellas
We're not supposed--- Don't worry about it
Bingham and Washington move outside
Scagnetti takes out his gun and tosses it to Washington
Before they can protest, Scagnetti closes the door
Mallory stands in the middle of the cell, motionless, her back to him
Scagnetti walks up behind her
Mallory doesn't move
Want a smoke
Mallory's steel eyes glare at Scagnetti
'mon,  already lit one for you know you smoke
Mallory doesn't respond
Scagnetti takes the cigarette from his mouth and puts it between Mallory's lips
Hold on
of Mallory
was reading the file on you
You know what it said during your trial, whenever they put you on the stand, no matter what they asked, your answer was always the same
' love Mickey
' It also says that when they gave you a polygraph, ' love Mickey' was the only thing you said that registered as the truth
Scagnetti appears at the side of frame next to Mallory
Who are you supposed to be
Squeaky Fromme
Is that it
Is Mickey your Charles Manson
Is Mickey Jesus
Is that the attraction
Or does he just got a big dick
Scagnetti changes to Mallory's other ear
That's it, isn't it
Mickey's got a big donkey dick
Scagnetti presses closer
Can you remember the last time you fucked
Huh
What  want you to do is close your eyes and remember
remember the last time ol' Mickey gave you the high hard one
Are ya thinkin' about it
Good
Remember it
Don't ever forget it cause it ain't never gonna happen again
Cause when they get through with all that electroshock shit they got lined up for you two, Mick's dick ain't gonna be worth shit
Mallory spits the lit cigarette unto Scagnetti's face
Scagnetti spins her around and slaps her
Look
You're gonna sit here for a couple hours while  finish up the arrangements
The reason they picked me to be your chaperone is they know won't hesitate to put a bullet in you
Scagnetti has Mallory clutched tightly by her shoulders
So, during our journey, if any wild hairs spring up on your ass, you'd better slap a muzzle on 'em
Fuck with me, bitch, even a little bit, you're gonna get accidentally shot
Comprehende
Mallory looks at him for a moment, then gives his a massive As we hear the  of his nose, Scagnetti lets out a horrible scream

- Bingham and Washington burst through the door to find Scagnetti face down on the ground
Mallory's standing, her foot pressed against the middle of Scagnetti's back, pulling his arms behind him trying to break his back
His body is bending like a branch, and he's screaming
The two deputies proceed to  the shit out of her with their shotguns
Scagnetti rolls around in the
, holding his bloody nose, screaming
She broke my fucking nose
That bitch broke my nose
Washington comes over to him and helps him up
(blood down his face) She broke my nose
'll fix it
He grabs Scagnetti's nose, then  it back into place
Scagnetti lets out another horrible scream, and hops up and down from the pain
When the rush of pain passes, Scagnetti brings his hands down from his face, looking over at Mallory
Bingham has Mallory in the corner of the cell with the shotgun barrel placed in her mouth
on Scagnetti
He's a hand grenade with the pin pulled
Hold her, boys
Scagnetti walks to the corner where Mallory is
The shotgun barrel's out of her mouth
Bingham and Washington stand on either side of her, holding her in place
Scagnetti grabs a can of mace from Washington's belt, and brings it up to Mallory's face
Mallory and Scagnetti trade looks
Scagnetti gives her an intense blast of mace right in the face, eyes, and all over her body
Mallory crumples to the floor, screaming in agony

They can't look at this anymore
Mallory wiggles on the floor as Scagnetti continues spraying her all over her body

It spurts to a stop
Scagnetti rises up to the two deputies

Unruly Julie shrugs her shoulders like 'what are you gonna do' and continues applying make-up
Wayne and Wurlitzer talk
So we got a deal
Four deputies--- And me
Why don't we make it three deputies and you
Why don't  have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing
Chill out, Phill
Four deputies and you,  can live with that
We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes
Don't call my men assholes
didn't mean they were assholes mean if they're leaving, get 'em outta here
Wayne leaves Wurlitzer and goes over to Scott, who's setting up a light stand
Okay, Scotty, we're stuck with four of these assholes
Now  want to create the illusion that this is just Mickey and  chewin' the fat all by ourselves
So make sure you don't film these assholes
don't want to see 'em on film ever
Oh, and 'Live at Five' slated our spot as human interest which means we'll go live at just after five-thirty
Wayne exits to reveal Mickey in

This asshole's tryin' to tell me what 'm gonna do in my jail
Fuck him
This nanderfuck doesn't know what he's dealin' with here, but we do

He takes a big bite
Say something
(mouthful of donut) What
Anything
Mickey swallows the bite of donut, pauses, then recites a poem
(talking in rhyme) stand amid the roar Of a surf tormented shore, As  hold within my hand Grains of the golden sand-- How few
yet how they creep Through my fingers to the deep, While  weep--while  weep
God
can  not save One from the pitiless wave
Is all that we see or seem But a dream within a dream
Mickey bites into the donut
(mouthful of donut) How was that
Roger joins him in  and adjusts the mike
Ah
fine
Let me make an adjustment here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n roll
Oh
uh, the dumbass at the donut place put a chocolate cream filled  asked for in your box
There's a chocolate cream filled in there
Yeah
Ya see,  ordered that special
Tough titty, it's mine now
Look, 'll trade you
Wayne enters frame
Roger, enough with the fucking donuts
What did  tell you
Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra
(to himself) Fine
Roger, what the hell are you doing
You're bothering the serial killer
Roger exits
Wayne grabs a chair and sets it in front of Mickey
Sorry about that
Don't worry about it
We're about ready to go here
Are you ready
Let's do it
Wayne smiles and exits
(
) Okay people
Let's start to settle down here
: - 16mm -  & is now  through Scott's  which holds a  of Mickey's eye
focuses then pulls out to include his whole face
(
) Are you comfortable
Mickey looks to Wayne   and nods
(
) Roger
(
) Rockin'
(
) Scotty
(
) Rollin'
and speed
(
) Slate it
reading '  --  #1' is thrust into view and clapped
The   out to include Wayne in the So, Mickey, tell us what you do for fun
Aside from the obvious
Mickey breaks out laughing
(not amused) Yes
Aside from the obvious
Mickey's laughing slowly runs its course
Okay, let me see now
What do  do for fun
(to people
) Does anybody got a smoke
You guys are drivin' me crazy with your cigarettes
(to camera) Sorry out there in  land
'm just sittin' here lookin'' at these deputies smokin' up a storm, and it's really doin' it to me
deputy comes into , hands Mickey a cigarette, then lights it
Deputy exits
Much obliged
What do  do for fun
Do you want to know what  do for fun or what  did for fun
What
Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun for starters
What  did for fun for starters
(thinking) Well, something  used to do
always was a lot of fun
(pause) No, scratch that
Let me think of something else
In fact, why don't we come back to that question
Ask me something else
Do you miss Mallory
Of course,  miss Mallory
She's my wife
haven't seen her in a long time
What a stupid question
Then was it worth it
Was what worth it
Was massacring all those people worth being separated from your wife for the rest of your life
Mickey takes a drag from his cigarette
Do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue
No, Mickey,  can't let you get away with that shit
Answer the question
Was it worth it
You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year
Was it worth it
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie
Yeah, it was
Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity
What was the instant of purity
The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail
That's only part of it
mean, it's a big, big, big part
But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song
(passionately) Please explain to me, Mickey, where's the purity that you couldn't live without in five year old Danny Millhouse's blown off head
Where's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and Mallory
What's so fucking pure about that
in on Mickey's face
Mickey looks at Wayne, takes a slow drag off his cigarette
Where the purity comes into play--- The image on the  starts to flutter, and then jams
fills the
(
) Camera jam
'm sorry Wayne
God
(
) Fucking dammit
Mickey hold onto that thought
Reload, quick
- We're back to  35mm
to reveal the wall of the holding cell
pans onto Mallory on the floor, splashing water on her face from the holding cell toilet
The pain has started to subside
All wet, she lies down on the ground and sings: (singing) Love is a hurtin' thang, and it leaves a fiery sting
(
) Okay
Okay, we're up again
(
) Roll it
Save the slate
: - 16MM -  & We're looking through Scott's  again on a new roll of film
You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie
don't understand
What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies
You'll never understand
Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species
used to be you
then  evolved
From where you're standing, you're a man
From where 'm standing, you're a ape
'm here
'm right here
and you
you're somewhere else, man
You say why
say why not
Tell me about the purity
(laughing) It's not that easy, Wayne
Donuts and a smoke only get you so far
You're gonna have to do your job
(laughs) Okay
okay
'll buy that
We'll move on and come back later
'm sure we will
Describe Mallory
Describe Mallory
Okay
She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers
Don't play dumb with me, Mickey
You know what  mean
Describe Mallory
(points at his head) What's up here
(points at his heart) What's in here
That's indescribable
Well, riddle me this, Batman
How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again
(smiles) Says who
Says the United States of America
(laughs) When have they ever been right
The crew laughs (
) Hey, just like Soupy Sales
- Scagnetti walks down the hallway leading to the supply room
His face is a patchwork of medical tape, to set his broken nose
Bloody cotton protrudes from each nostril
- Scagnetti walks into the supply room
Mickey is explaining to Wayne 'Why he's killed all those people
' Scagnetti can't believe what he's seeing
The entire room is in rapture
one night  was asleep, and a noise wakes me up
thought, 'Oh shit, somebody's broken in
'  didn't own a gun, so  go into the living room with a fucking umbrella
Okay, it turned out to be nothing
God made the noise
Who knows
(whispers) How's it goin'
(whispers) Shhhh
wanna hear this
Wurlitzer sees Scagnetti's bandaged face
What the hell happened to you
You should see the other bitch
What time you got
Two-thirty
Shhh
leaves them and travels the room, studying the faces of the deputies, Unruly Julie, Roger, and Wayne as they listen to Mickey's story
But  came to the direction  need a gun
Do, the next day  started off early for work, and 'm gonna stop by a gun shop and pick up a little home protection
walked into the place and had never seen so many guns in all my life
So, 'm lookin' around, the this really nice sales guy comes up to me
His name was Warren
'll never forget his name
He was really nice
Anyway, Warren showed me all these different models of guns
Magnums, automatics, pistols, Walters
And ask to see a shotgun
He brings me a Mossberg pump action shotgun
As soon as  held that baby in my hands,  knew what  was gonna do
It felt so good
It felt like it was a part of me
They had a mirror in the store
looked at myself holding it, and looked so fuckin' good,  immediately bought it
Bought a bunch of boxes of ammo
Turned my car around, drove to Mallory's house, we took care of Mallory's parents, packed up the car, and we were off
: :  through Scott's : on Mickey
Everybody thought 'd gone crazy
The cops, my mom, everybody
But you see, they all missed the point of the story
wasn't crazy
But when  was holding the shotgun, it all became clear realized for the first time my one true calling in life
'm a natural born killer
Okay, let's cut it
:  35mm (to Scott) Did ya get that
Unruly Julie hands Wayne a notebook
He starts flipping pages
It's gonna be beautiful
Super cool
(to Mickey) This is great stuff
How ya doin'

(yelling) Could  get a Coke for Mickey
'm not running out and getting that piece of shit a Coke
Fine

(to the room) What's around here
There's an In and Out Burgers about a block away on Olive
It's walking distance
Okay, Julie, take everybody's order
'll have a double double with cheese, french fries, and a large Coke
Unruly Julie writes down Wayne's order in her notebook, then goes from person to person collecting their orders
Scagnetti and Wurlitzer talk to each other
Are you all set
Yeah
Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll
assigned you Bingham and Washington to go along
In

They're real Goddamn good
They'll be there for when ya need 'em

Coolin' her jets in a holding cell
Unruly Julie walks up to the two men to take their order
In the

Nothing for me

Me, neither

Unruly Julie walks away
deputy yells for Wurlitzer
Capt'n
Yeah
The deputy holds the receiver of the wall phone in his hand
They need you
Emergency
Wurlitzer rushes to the phone, grabs the receiver
(into phone) Talk to me
(pause) Where
(pause) For the love of Pete
okay
okay okay
Mobilize the men
'm on my way
away from Wurlitzer to the extremely curious eavesdroppers
glides by all of them: Scagnetti, Wayne, Scott, Roger, Unruly Julie, and finally ends up on Mickey
holds on Mickey as he contemplates Wurlitzer's conversation
the phone receiver being  down
(
) 'll be a son of a bitch
There's a riot going on in the laundry room
(
) Is it serious
(
) It sure as hell is
They got guns, hostages, and explosives
The room reacts
(
) Jack, could you stay up here for a while
(
) Yeah, sure
(
) 'm taking one of these men
Yates, come with me
(
) Could we go with you and film it
(
) Stay up here and finish your interview, 've got to see what the hell's going on down there before  can take responsibility for you to film there
We hear Wurlitzer and Deputy Yates walk out
Unruly Julie walks into  next to Mickey
She has her notebook
'll have a four by four
That's four patty burgers
Now they don't have that on the menu, but if you order a four by four, they'll know what you're talking about
large Coke and two orders of fries
When she finishes writing down Mickey's order, Julie walks off silently
follows Julie out the door and into
- with Julie as she walks down the corridor
As  with shotguns and riot gear speed down the hall, the passes Julie and speeds down the corridor, following the into
- from blackness to   of a dark jail wall masques with shadows of prison bars
The surreal echoing sounds of a riot swell until
of a   stumbles into frame, followed by a of other  carrying  and
The Mob catches the Prison Guard and beat him mercilessly before moving on
down to a  of a thin stream of  crawling across the floor
: - through Scott's : on Mickey, who's standing in a
You guys wanna hear a joke  heard
(
) Sure
Now, 'm no comedian, but it's pretty funny
It's a Little Johnny joke
Now in the joke, Little Johnny can't talk
And Little Johnny's teenage sister asks her mother if she can go out on a date
As Mickey tells this joke, he moves around the room
Scott's follows
The mother asks, 'Where's he taking you
' The sister says, 'The drive-in movie
' The mother tells her she can only go if she takes Little Johnny with her
She says okay
They go to the drive-in, they come back
The mother gets Little Johnny and says, 'Okay, what happened
Where did ya go
' Mickey, as Little Johnny, draws a square in the air, and acts like he's driving
Mother says, 'The drive-in movie
What did they do
' Mickey, as Little Johnny, acts like he's kissing
'They kissed
What else
' Mickey, as Little Johnny, starts squeezing imaginary breasts
'He felt her up
What else
' Mickey, as Little Johnny, acts like he's undressing
(dumbfounded) 'They took off their clothes
What else
' Mickey, as Little Johnny, vigorously acts as if he's having sex
'They did it
What were you doing
' Mickey, as Little Johnny, vigorously acts as if he's jacking off
Everyone in the room breaks up
Wayne, the boys, the deputies, even Scagnetti cracks a smile
As Mickey was telling the joke, he stopped in front of Deputy #4 during the punchline
While everybody's laughing, Mickey  his elbow in Deputy #4's face
Mickey grabs hold of the shotgun, rips it from Deputy #4's grasp, then  him in the face three times with the butt
Deputy #4 drops, ugly and unconscious
Scott's  goes wild
:  35mm
The other deputies react
Mickey pumps the shotgun slide and shoots, hitting Deputy #5 in the chest,  him off his feet
He lands on his back with a
Deputy #3 raises his shotgun
Mickey drops to a crouching position and ,  Deputy #3 in the groin
Deputy #3 crumples into the wall,  his gun --
The stray bullet  Scott right in the chest,  him out of
Deputy #3 drops to the floor,  his shotgun straight up -- of ceiling being
Chunks of plaster and rock rain down on Sheriff #3
Scagnetti has whipped out his gun and is bringing it up to fire --
Mickey, still crouched down, spins around toward Scagnetti -- Scagnetti has his gun aimed at Mickey
Squatting, Mickey has the shotgun trained on Scagnetti
They're positioned across from each other on opposite sides of the room
Nobody fires
We  past the faces of both Wayne and Roger, who are flat on the ground, scared to death
on Scagnetti's face
on Mickey's face
on Scagnetti's finger putting pressure on the trigger, then moves up to a  profile of his face
of Mickey
moves down in front of him into a  on his face
Looks like we got a Mexican standoff
Slide the shotgun over here, put your hands behind your head, put your forehead on the floor
Or what
You'll wound me
can blow you in half and you know it
've never wounded anything in my life
got you locked right between the eyes
Mickey rises
If you don't drop that toy, 'm blowin' you in half on three
So, if you got me locked, take the shot
One

, past the gun, to his face
of barrel of shotgun
(
) Two
continues closing in on Scagnetti's face
Wayne watches, wide eyed
on Mickey's face
Three
on Scagnetti
Hold it
Don't shoot
He  the hammer back into place on his gun, then points the gun up
Open the chamber
Empty the shells
Scagnetti does
The shells fall out
The shells fall on the floor at Scagnetti's feet --
Toss it
Scagnetti does
Now put your hands behind your head
Scagnetti does
Mickey, holding the shotgun, walks up to Scagnetti
They stand, facing each other
Did you ever see 'Eldorado
' What
Mickey  him across the face with the shotgun
Scagnetti hits the ground
Blood coughs from his broken nose
Mickey looks at Wayne and Roger on the ground
You guys stay on your bellies
Yes, sir
Mickey bends over Scagnetti and takes hold of his right hand
am the most dangerous man in the world
Mickey  the trigger finger on Scagnetti's right hand
Scagnetti screams
Mickey's still bent over Scagnetti
(points at Scagnetti) You're the law
(points at himself) 'm the law breaker
Scagnetti's not going to give Mickey and more trouble
Mickey stands straight, looks toward Wayne and Roger
Donut, get your camera
See if it's broke
Let me check on Scott
He's hurt bad
Scott's dead
And unless you wanna play follow the leader, shut up and do as you're told
Roger's checking the camera
He turns on the motor
It sounds like a lawn mower
How is it
Not good
Do you have a back up
It's video
Even better
Wayne call your station, tell 'em we're going live a little early today
Make it happen
: - Wurlitzer steps into the
This  becomes a that never leaves Wurlitzer
Although we'll only see Wurlitzer, we can make out activity in the edges of the and we can vividly hear the  of chaos around us
want two men stationed in that tier, and  want men with rifles all along the walkway
(
) Capt'n
Wurlitzer walks over to a table and looks down
(
) Here's the layout of the laundry room
Where do the air ducts lead
(
) Here
(
) Problem is they'll hear somebody approaching that way
(
) We turned off the power when they took over the room
We turn it back on
The machines go back on supplying us with the cover noise we need
Smithy, do it
(
) Right away, Capt'n
follows Wurlitzer as he heads another direction
Jonesy, are the sharpshooters in place
(
) Yes
You sure
(
) think-- Never say you think when you know, or you know when you think
Wurlitzer snatches a walkie talkie
(into walkie talkie) Bergman, you in place
(
) (from walkie talkie) Sure am, Capt'n
Nothin' clean yet
(into walkie talkie) Pass this to your team
the second they get a lock on a blue, they're to take the shot
Do you understand
(
) (from walkie talkie) That's a big ten-four, Capt'n
Wurlitzer looks to his right
What do you think, Pitney
How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there
(
) It's hard to say Capt'n
Take a wild stab
(
) 'll say enough to destroy this wing
The entire wing
(
) That's my opinion
Jesus

Wayne, stands alone in , moments from when we last saw him
This is Wayne Gayle reporting live from the Los Angeles County Jail, where you can tell from the bloody carnage behind me that the final chapter in the book called Mickey and Mallory has not yet been written
Mickey enters the  with shotgun in hand, pushing Wayne out
Thank you, Wayne, but our little movie just underwent a title change

We will try to re-establish contact with Wayne Gayle and bring you more on this late breaking story
Please stay tuned
: ' ' (
) This has been a  Special Report
: - :  35mm of Mickey, holding his shotgun
He walks over and grabs the shotgun from dead Deputy #5
Deputy #5 won't let go of the gun from his dead man's grip
Mickey finally yanks it loose
He extracts all the shells from the gun, picks them off the floor, and puts them in his pocket
Mickey picks up Scagnetti's gun, inserts the loose bullets and slips it into his pants
Okay, Jack, this is what we're doing
Stand behind me, put your back against mine and extend your arms behind you
Scagnetti rises, insecurely
He presses his back against Mickey's
Now if  feel your back move away from mine, you're gonna be ripped apart
Got it
Scagnetti's back to back with Mickey
His arms flank Mickey
Yeah
Okay, Wayne, step forward
Wayne enters
Mickey extends the shotgun
Keep comin'
Put your solar plexus against the barrel
Wayne does
Grab his arms
Wayne does and Mickey quickly binds their arms together with gaffer's tape, forming a two man ring around him
Either one of you two move, it's gonna be shotgun city
You understand
& Yes
Mickey tucks the tape roll into his shirt
You ready, Donut
Ready
Wagons, hooaaa
The hostage train starts moving
Wayne's walking backwards with the shotgun barrel pressed against his midsection
Scagnetti's walking back to back with Mickey and his own pistol pressed to his neck
Roger follows with the camera
- Mallory's sitting Indian style, singing Girl Scout songs to herself, and doing the hand motions
(singing) Whataleeatcha, whataleeatcha dodaleedo, dodaleedo
Whataleeatcha, whataleeatcha dodaleedo, dodaleedo
Simplest thing there isn't much to it
All ya gotta do is dodaleedo it like the rest, but the best part  like is Whataleeatcha, whataleeatcha dodaleedo, dodaleedo, do quack, quack
The cell door opens and the hostage train of Wayne, Mickey, Scagnetti, Roger and the camera, and two  they picked up along the way enters the room
The hostages are all wrapped with tape
on Mallory
She can't believe her eyes
(to Mallory) Honey, 'm home
Mallory runs into Mickey's arms, passionately kissing
This kiss has been a year coming
Now they're doing something everybody told them they would never do again
For this moment they are the only two people on earth
We're enraptured, too
does a 360 around the loving couple
(in between kisses) It's taken you so long to come to me
: - sheet of paper flashes through
(
) Here's the list of the rioters
to Wurlitzer reading, then looking up
Wait a minute, Bailey
Where's the list of the hostages
(
) 'm working on it Capt'n
Keep on it, son
Wurlitzer reads the list to himself as he paces
(reading the names) Alvarado, Issacs, Julian, Martinez, Newendyke, Olvera, Pool, Ramos, Schmidt, Spivey, Walsh, Westerguard
Wurlitzer drops into a chair, exhausted
He rubs his face with his hands
(
) Capt'n
Wurlitzer looks up, then looks back down
What is it Napalatoni
(
) Mickey Knox is loose
Wurlitzer looks up
What do you mean he's loose
(
) He's armed, he's killed three deputies and one of Wayne Gayle's guys
At the moment, he's hold up with Mallory Knox in her holding cell with Wayne Gayle, another  guy, that cop fella, and two other deputies as hostages
And Capt'n, they have one of them news cameras goin' live to
They won't stop playin' it
What do you want us to do
Wurlitzer holds a frozen look, as if a fuse has blown and his mind has shut down
If he were to open his mouth now nothing would come out
He just sits
: - The hostages have been cut free from each other and sit against the wall
Roger cradles the Betacam in his lap, rocking slowly as if in a trance, while Scagnetti feebly splints his broken fingers with the tape that hangs from his wrists
Wayne is standing, alert and ready for action
As for the two deputies,   #1 sits in anger, tight-lipped and stoic
The other,    is panicked and jumpy, one may never see a more nervous man
Mickey and Mallory stand over them with their weapons drawn
Okay, we're going out that door, and we're gonna march down the hall and right out of the building
(to Wayne) Donut said something about a news van
Yeah, we have a van
Where's it parked
Out front
Let me have the keys
Wayne points to Roger
Roger digs through his pocket and tosses the keys to Mickey
Mickey, can  talk to you alone
No
This is crazy
You can't escape like this
Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try
We'll all be killed
Exciting, isn't it
Duncan begins to cry
Now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains
If we say move, you move
If we say left, you move left
If we say right, you move right
If we say mole, you dig a hole
Got it
Are we in a big hurry
You got something you want to do
Yeah
By all means, knock yourself out
Thanks
Roll 'em, Donut
Roger snaps up and hoists the camera to his shoulder
: Shot through Roger's :   on Mallory as she points to Scagnetti sitting on the floor
You
Stand up
Scagnetti gulps, then rises knowing that he has fucked with the wrong woman
Mallory walks up to him with pistol in hand
You probably thought it was pretty funny, didn't ya
She raises Scagnetti's pistol, aiming it at its former owner
Scagnetti flinches and squirms
Can you remember the last time you fucked with me
Close your eyes and remember
Are ya thinking about it
Good
Mallory fires three shots into Scagnetti's chest
Roger's  jumps, then follows the body to the floor
Roger on Scagnetti slumped on the floor
(
) Oh God
Oh God
Ohhhh
We're sending out a hostage
Don't touch him
the door is kicked open
Roger's  whips around to witness Mickey and Mallory jumping into the corridor,  with their guns while using the hostages for shields
Roger's  moves out of the cell and
(   ) - There are even more   in the corridor
whistles by as Roger dodges to catch up with the caravan
The footage is very similar to Vietnam footage
It's shaky, real, harsh, and it captures the pandemonium of battle
The soundtrack is a mixture of yelling, crying, laughing, and gunfire
#1 is , and discarded by Mickey
The wild caravan runs down the hallway,  behind them
Mickey's , but keeps on running and
Mallory sees this and screams
Mickey
Don't stop
Roger's  runs along with them
(
) Man, oh, man
this is better than Vietnam
More  appear at the end of the hallway
Mickey and Mallory get back to back with each other, using as a shield in front of them and Wayne behind them
Mickey  from the front, Mallory  from the rear
Please don't kill me
Don't kill me
to catch a Deputy hopping around the corner
The    with a
Roger's , and the  goes haywire, reeling out of control, the  to the ground
Roger screams
lies on the floor, video still transmitting
Roger rolls into  screaming
(
) Get the camera
Get the fucking camera
:  35mm
As Mickey  cover for her, Mallory swipes the camera from Roger's side
The Knox's start running again, still holding Wayne and last hostage
Deputies are lying on the ground, wounded and screaming, or dead and silent
(to Mallory) This way
- The caravan bursts into the stairwell
Mickey turns to Duncan the remaining hostage deputy
(to Duncan) Where does this lead
Duncan is hyper-ventilating
Mickey pushes him against to wall
Where
Th-- the ground floor
Is that the front door
Duncan nods frantically
Let's go
Mickey grabs Duncan and the caravan starts running down the stairs
They go down a few flights
As they run down one last flight, they find Wurlitzer and a team of  waiting for them on the ground floor
The deputies raise their guns
Mallory grabs hold of Wayne, and gets behind him with one hand pressing the barrel of her gun against his temple and her other are wrapped around his neck, holding him close to her
Back off or 'll blast him
Back off or 'll blast him
Back off or 'll blast him
None of the deputies lower their guns, but they appear less likely to start shooting
Wayne screams
Don't shoot
beg you, don't shoot
Please, please, please
Wayne continues begging
Wurlitzer steps forward
Now Mickey, Mallory, just let me say--- Shut up
Don't talk,  don't wanna hear it
You have to know--- said shut up
Mallory quickly lowers her gun from Wayne's head and  him in the thigh
She whips the gun back up to his head
Wayne's screaming in pain
The deputies jump back
and  mean shut up
There's a bit of a silent standoff
Tears are streaming down Duncan's face as the caravan slowly retreats back up the stairs to the next flight
The deputies hold their present position
: - The caravan goes up one flight, then stops
Mickey and Mallory let their two hostages sit down
Duncan is out and out hysterical, urine stains the front of his uniform
Mickey's pacing
Think
think
think
Mallory leans up against the wall, holding her side with her hand
Blood trickles out between the fingers
We see now she's been shot
Over Duncan's impassioned clamour they can hear Wurlitzer yelling from below
(
) Give up
There's no other way out
Mickey sits down, utterly exhausted
Mallory sits down next to
him
She winces in pain
He puts his arm around her
Look, lover boy, we're not getting outta here
So  say the hell with going back to our cells
Let's do a Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid
Run down these stairs shootin', go out in a hail of bullets, but take as many of those motherfuckers with us as possible
Suddenly, Mickey's exhaustion lifts
He has a plan
We'll do that when all else fails
Mickey stands
Hasn't it
We still got a few tricks up our sleeves
Mickey confronts the two hostages
He points at Duncan
You married
Oh,  don't wanna die
Are you married
Do you have kids
Duncan nods pathetically
Good
People, we're goin' all the way to the front door
Now, the only way we're gonna get there is if they don't want to kill you two more than they want to kill us
: of deputies with guns in their hands, just itching to kill Mickey and Mallory
We hear Mickey's voice over this
(
) Right now  find that highly unlikely
So, let's help 'em out, shall we
: Mickey is squatting in front of Wayne
Now, say  tell those guys down there if they shoot or make a move, 'm killin' Wayne Gayle
And they shoot or make a move anyway
Now say by some freak accident, you didn't die, you live though it
What would you do
Mickey pulls the roll of '  from his shirt and starts tearing strips of tape and sticking them to the wall
What would  do
Me and my network would sue the entire Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department for flagrantly disregarding my safety
'd go straight to my buddy, the mayor, and make sure everyone of those son of a bitches down there ends up on the unemployment line
In fact, 'd sue every man down there personally would make it my life's ambition to bring the  County Jail to its knees
would do expose after expose on the brutality, and the conditions, and the inhumanity that exists here
Mickey tosses the tape roll to Mallory and gestures to Duncan
Mallory winks at Mickey
Mickey smiles and begins wrapping tape around the barrel of his shotgun
That's what  thought
You tell them that
When we go down those stairs, want you to scream what you just told me
'My name is Wayne Gayle
am the star of American Maniacs watched every week by'-- how many people
On average forty million
'Every week by forty million people am a respected journalist
' Have you won any awards
Are you kidding
The Golden Globe, The Edward
Murrow award
'Respected journalist'-- On your knees
Wayne kneels in front of Mickey
While Mickey speaks he props his shotgun under Wayne's chin and wraps the tape from the barrel around his neck
(continues) 'Winner of the Golden Globe and the Edward
Murrow award among others
' Tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer, his firm, his address, and phone number
Tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines
You getting the idea
Yes
Mickey stands with Wayne as he tapes his trigger hand to the stock of the shotgun
Say it
Scream it
All the way out the front door and into your van
And if you stop screaming,  swear to God 'll blow your head off
Got it
Mickey grabs the camera, and lifts it to his shoulder before shouting to Duncan
You
What's your name
Duncan can't answer, Mallory has gagged him with his tape
Mallory grabs Duncan by the collar and lifts him off the floor before reading his name badge
Duncan
Homolka
: ( ) - Wurlitzer and the deputies are deciding their next move when they hear: (
) Start
Wayne and Duncan come into view with the Knoxs behind them
The deputies quickly raise their guns, but soon realize if they take out either Mickey of Mallory that Wayne or Duncan would die
Mallory's right hand is taped to the trigger and stock of the shotgun that's wrapped firmly to Duncan's neck
The pistol in her left hand is trained on Wurlitzer
Mickey's left hand masters the shotgun leash on Wayne, while he monitors the Deputies with the  on his right shoulder
: The following scene will intercut between and  35mm
Wayne starts belting out his speech as Mickey focus the on Wurlitzer
Duncan simply cries and begs for his life to be spared
(yelling) My name is Wayne Gayle
am the star of 'American Maniacs', watched by forty million people every week
am a respected journalist, winners of the Golden Globe, the Edward
Murrows Award among others
If anybody puts me in danger, my network will sue The Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department
My estate will sue every officer personally who fires
The network's law firm is Rowlands, Davis and Sinclair
Mickey knew what he was doing
This has an effect on the deputies
(yelling) Make a path
The wall of deputies starts moving backward
The Knoxs and their hostages start moving forward with Wayne yelling all the way
The deputies keep their guns trained on the caravan, but they keep giving ground, until they reach the doors of the front lobby and they begin to part like the Red Sea
Wurlitzer stands his ground
How far do you think your gonna get
Right out the front door
That'll never happen
It is happening
The caravan marches forth
Wayne and Duncan keep shouting their speeches
Nobody dares to move on them, but the deputies keep their weapons ready
Wayne stops his speech to take a breath
Don't stop
Wayne starts up again
The deputies are completely frustrated
Mickey and Wurlitzer are nose to nose
(to Mickey) will personally hunt you down, blow the head off your fucking-whore-wife, and plant your sick ass in the ground all by myself
(calmly) Another day perhaps, but not today
Mickey leaves
: - The doors swing wide in   as the caravan of Mickey, Mallory, Wayne and Duncan take their first step into the open air
crescent of deputies frame the group in the
while Wurlitzer stands, defeated, just behind Mickey
on
Image  to  &  before  into - The   is disrupted by a fogged image in  & The image settles into a  of Wayne
He's being filmed by a 16mm  that he is presently balancing on a fence post
This entire  is played out cinema verite
The  is not in sync as Wayne steps back into a
He looks directly into the
This is Wayne Gayle
'm wounded and my crew, Roger and Scott, are dead
This may be out of sync 'cause we are shooting with a wild camera and a standard recorder we found in the van
Mickey Knox's plan worked
We walked out the front door, into my news van and made our getaway
When we were followed by patrol cars, Mallory Knox killed Deputy Sheriff Duncan Homolka and tossed his body out of the back
Mickey told authorities over my police band that  would surely be next if they didn't give up the pursuit
They took Mickey at his word and called off the pursuit
Why helicopters weren't employed,  don't know
My only thought is it all happened too fast for arrangements to be made
We've just pulled off to the side of the road to do this interview
Tensions run high-- Mickey screams
(
) We ain't got all fuckin' day
Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory
Wayne steps forward and picks up the  and while conducting his interview, the  remains hand held
focuses on Mallory sitting on a stump, while Mickey paces in and out of  in the
Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's plan
Did you think it would work
It wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that  totally realized they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first
When we got out of the stairwell,  remember thinking, 'Oh my God
This might work
' But Mickey knew it would work all along
There wasn't any doubt in his mind
It's not like there was and he just didn't show it
He knew it would work
(
) What did you think then
wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together
And wondered if  could wait that long
(
) Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room
Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word  said
Oh, 'm sorry
Can say fuckin'
can't, can
(
) Try to keep it to a minimum
We had nothing to do with that riot
That riot was just -- whatchmacallit -- Mickey can be heard faintly in the
Divine intervention
What he said
We didn't know jack shit about and riot
It just happened
It was kismet
We didn't even know those people
How are we supposed to organize a riot when we've been in fuckin' isolation for the past year
Just bleep out the fucks and jack shits
(laughs) mean, it's not like we care
If they wanna say we masterminded the whole thing, let 'em
It won't exactly keep us up at night
But you said you wanted the truth, and the truth is we were just lucky
Mickey's snapping his fingers in the
'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up
(
) So, what now
Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take it easy
Just enjoy each other's company, stop and smell the roses, notice the color purple, stuff like that
(
) How do you intend to disappear
you're probably the most famous couple in America
Well, back in slave times they had a thing called the underground railroad
And we got a whole fan club out there just waiting to be conductors
(to the camera) So, you kids out there, keep the faith
Cause Mickey and Mallory will be comin' to your town real soon
Okay, that's enough
End of interview
We gotta move
Mickey approaches Wayne
goes a little haywire as Wayne lowers it from his eye
(
) Okay, just let me swing around and film myself asking the questions
And then 'll do my little wrap up
Mickey takes the  from Wayne, and while he speaks, he balances it on a fence post
Oh, we're gonna do a little wrap up, all right
But it won't be you starin' in the camera, looking dumb, and acting stupid
Instead, you're gonna be starin' down the barrels of our shotguns and we're gonna be pullin' the triggers
Wayne forces a chuckle
Mickey steps away from the  and into a
The   is parked in the
That's a joke right
Mickey pumps the slide of his shotgun
Mallory grabs her shotgun from off the ground
Just wait one fucking minute
said 'd give you a interview
Now unless 'm mistaken, we just did a interview
(to Mallory) We did an interview, didn't we
Looked like an interview to me
said we'd give you an interview never said we wouldn't kill you
Wait
don't know, but  kinda felt during this
this whole escape that a kind of bond-- Wayne is shaking
(continues) developed between the three of us
We're kindda in this together, don't ya think
No
Not really
Don't touch those triggers
Please think 've already proven that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a dead
Way-- Gayle
was your passport out of jail, not Duncan Homolka
But me
'll be your passport outta--- Just save your breath, Wayne
We hate you
If anybody in the fuckin' world deserves to die, it's you
Wayne is grasping for anything
Wait
You can't kill me
Mickey and Mallory always leave somebody alive to tell the tale
We are
(points to camera) Your camera
Mickey turns to Mallory
(John Wayne voice) Let's make a little music, Colorada
The two interview subjects start  rounds into Wayne, who's body dances like a puppet before collapsing to the ground
Mickey and Mallory kiss each other passionately, then climbing into the news van, they drive away
Wayne's body lay peacefully in  until the eventually runs out of film
