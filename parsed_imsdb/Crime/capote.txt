Written by Dan Futterman Based on the book "Capote:  Biography" by Gerald Clarke :         "Western Kansas, 1959" - The  follows a    , long hair, pretty Sunday church dress, walking toward a peaceful farmhouse
At the door she lifts the knocker
The door opens slightly
The girl turns and looks past the camera at her , sitting in an old Plymouth idling in the driveway
Her mother shrugs, motions for her to go inside
- The girl walks through the downstairs rooms
In the kitchen, the  is  the hook
The girl looks back toward the open front door
She turns toward the stairs, climbs them
,   - She walks down the hall to a   at the end
The door is slightly ajar
She knocks, then enters the room
,  - The girl's : the  pans across the bedroom of a high school coed
We see the desk, the bureau, the bed
On the bed lies  , her wrists and legs bound in rope, in the head
There is blood on the wall
The sixteen year-old girl stands immobile
Before she starts to scream, : - Trees ring the edge of a field
: ,  - Buildings lit against the night sky
/ - Camera follows group of partygoers as they mount the stairs: Truman Capote, Barbara (very tall), Rose, Christopher, Williams
,    / - The friends are standing in the crowded kitchen -- people are coming in and out -- talking and drinking and laughing
So Jimmy Baldwin tells me the plot of his book, and he says to me: the writing's going well, but  just want to make sure it's not one of those problem novels
said: Jimmy, your novel's about a Negro homosexual who's in love with a Jew -- wouldn't you call that a problem
Laughter
Susan's father had a minor heart attack, so she's writing more erotic poems about death and sex
It's so tiresome
Hmm
What rhymes with angina
Laughter
We see Truman watching everyone laugh notices, leans in to him
As the rest of the group continues talking, we come closer, hear their conversation
How's your writing
Oh, 've got a million ideas of what to write next --  just have to choose one
Really
No
Their attention is pulled back into the group as: Who would  want to play me
Natalie Wood
Too fat
Audrey Hepburn
Not bad
Sort of middle-class
When a movie is made of my life know exactly who  want as me
(beat) Marilyn Monroe
Barbara cracks up, chokes on her drink
' /  - Truman sits with his coffee, reading the New York Times
An article catches his eye
He sits up straight, folds the paper over, reads it
' ,  - / of article being snipped out of  39 of the Times, November 16, 1959
As the page gets turned around with each snip, we see a small  of a middle-aged man wearing glasses, with the caption: " : Herbert
Clutter, a wealthy Kansas farmer
" We read the headline: " , 3
Parts of the story: ", Kan
, Nov
15 () --
wheat farmer, his wife
two young children found shot today
" ' ,  - Truman on the phone
New Yorker magazine
( ) William Shawn, please
(he listens) Adorable one
All of a sudden  know what article 'm going to write for you next
' , / - Truman on the phone, on a long cord, travels between the study and the kitchen as he talks to William Shawn
We hear pieces of the conversation, and see Truman in different parts of the room as he says each bit
never had anything like this happen to them before
They're used to sleeping at night with the doors unlatched
(laughs) Yes, we should buy stock in Master Locks -- all of Kansas will be in the hardware store tomorrow
Jump to - They have no idea who the killer is
But it doesn't matter who the killer is -- what matters is who the townspeople imagine the killer is
That's what  want to write about
Jump to - 'm gonna need some help
'm thinking about Nelle -- she can protect me
(strong, Irish-American, ten years older than Truman) -- his longtime boyfriend -- enters the front door with a bag of groceries, stops in the hall
He sees Truman on the phone
Truman looks at Jack, though he's still speaking to Shawn -- want to leave tonight
: ,      - train barrels toward us, its headlight bright
The train roars past, away from the city
,  - Truman hurries through the train, checking his ticket with the sleeper cabins
His long  trails behind
His longer cashmere  practically brushes the floor
' ,  - Truman opens the door
Inside the cabin his childhood friend from Monroeville, Alabama,    (yes, that Harper Lee), is reading
She looks up, deadpan -- figured you'd missed it
Nelle is a year younger than Truman, dowdy in dress, but smart, tough, sensible
Truman smiles
God 'm glad you agreed to come
You're the only one  know with the qualifications to be both a research assistant and personal bodyguard
(then, noticing) Oh, Nelle, you poor thing
He tries to spruce up her limp silk scarf
Off
Truman
Off
(holds his hands) 'm happy to see you too, but  can still whip your behind
enter, one with an enormous (Truman's), the other with a sensible  (Nelle's)
#1 (reading tags) Mr
Truman Capote, Miss Nelle Harper Lee
Where would you like these, sir
That one up there and that one on the floor
He tips them
What all did you bring
#2 Thank you greatly, sir
It's an honor to have you with us
If you don't mind my saying, your last book was even better than the first -- You're sweet
#2 Just when you think they've gotten as good as they can get
Thank you
You're very kind
#1 (to Nelle) Ma'am
The  leave
Nelle is stunned
Truman fiddles with the trunk locks, his back to Nelle
Silence, then: You're pathetic
Truman doesn't answer
You're pathetic
What
You paid them to say that
Truman won't look at her
She whacks him
You paid them to say that
(squealing) How'd you know
How did you know
"Just when you think they've gotten as good as they can get
" You think that was too much
(laughter) thought that was a good line
More laughter
More smacking of Truman
Then it is quiet
Pathetic
' ,  - Nelle's awake, but still in her bunk, looking out the window at the Kansas plains
Truman's dressing, watching her

The  chugs across the Kansas flatlands
of  outside Garden City: "World's Largest Free Swimpool" and "Howdy, Stranger
Welcome to Garden City Friendly Place
" -- - Truman and Nelle rent a car
People stare

- Nelle drives past the main square, Truman in the passenger seat
Truman looks at a photo in
Alvin Dewey, Kansas Bureau of Investigation

People stare
Nelle notices

Mr
Alvin Dewey, please
Third floor
In what used to be the Sheriff's Office
Truman
'  - In the reception area,   and the two other assigned to the Clutter case are getting their jackets on and straightening their ties
They've completely taken over the office
They are:  "Brother"  (34); and "Curly  (60 - bald)
They all smoke
Sheriff   -- 60's, kind, overweight -- is office-less (though he and his wife  still live on the fourth floor of the Courthouse
)  lurks in the background, nowhere to go, emptying one of many ,  by the
Truman and Nelle enter as: The wife said no more smoking in the house
told her, "Fine
Walter's got a couch upstairs in his apartment
'll stay with him and Dorothy till we're done here
" (to Walter) 've got my bag and a carton of cigarettes in the car
looks uncomfortable
Dewey shakes his head at Church
Roy
Mr
Dewey
Truman Capote from the New Yorker
Silence
The Agents stare at him
Hello
Silence
Nye is looking at Truman, particularly puzzled
Bergdorf's
Sorry
The scarf
Oh
(then) Nice
Thank you
(turns to Dewey) wonder when we could arrange an interview
Some time to talk
Dewey stubs out his cigarette
About what
We're not looking for any inside information --  don't care one way or another if you catch whoever did this -- 'm writing an article not about the Clutter killings, but how they're affecting the town, how you all are bearing up -- care
Excuse me
care
(puts on his hat, pulls out another cigarette) care a great deal if we catch whoever did this
Yes -- As do a lot of folks around here
Of course
Dewey walks out
Nye and Church start out after him
(to Church) New Yorker
You have press credentials
What's the New Yorker
Magazine
Magazines don't give out -- You can come to the news conference with the rest of them
(tips his hat to Nelle) Sears and Roebuck
Nelle and Truman are left alone
- Packed with  from all over the Midwest, as well as local Finney County
Dewey's leading the press conference from a set up in front of the Judge's bench, flanked by the two other  Agents
He's got a cigarette burning in an ashtray
Truman and Nelle stand in the back
'll talk facts but  won't speculate
The main fact here we need to be clear on is not one, but four people were killed
lot of folks say Herb Clutter had to be the main target because he was dealt with the most brutally -- #1 Had his throat cut
(a moment) Yes
We'd all like to know why
But it could've been any one of the family they were after
We just don't know -- #2 You've identified the murder weapon
Wounds indicate a shotgun, close- range, but no casings were found
#1 Twelve-gauge, hunting -- Right
#1 They were all shot in the face
Dewey looks at the journalist
Then, evenly: No
Nancy in the back of the head
#2 Is there any evidence of, 'm sorry, sexual molestation of the women
No
#2 Anything else stolen
Kenyon's radio seems to be the only
#3 The boy was sixteen
Fifteen
Nancy was sixteen
#2 It's her friend that found them
Laura Kinney
#2 Spell that
assume you're okay with the Laura part
-----
But, please, leave her be
Lots of folks try to talk at once, one   makes himself heard above the rest: There's talk of a bunch of Mexicans, a whole bunch of Mexicans
(standing, stubs out cigarette) George, it's good to see you again
do have an opinion whether this was the work of one man or a whole bunch, as you said, but it doesn't matter a whole lot whether it was Mexicans or Methodists or Eskimos
We're going to find whoever did this
Four good people from our community are dead
Let's remember that
Okay with you
(holds up a notice) The West Kansas Farm Committee's offering a thousand dollar reward for information leading to an arrest
Please print that
(moving to the exit) Thank you all for coming
The room is immediately noisy as Dewey makes his way to the door, pulling a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, followed by Church and Nye
He's about to step out when Truman catches his eye
Dewey exits
: - Nelle drives while consulting a
Truman is leaning back, looking out at the passing farms through the window
He speaks almost to himself
Mr
Dewey's protective of the Clutters
wonder how well he knew them
Nelle glances over at him
He doesn't notice
He was foxy with that old man
(turns to Nelle) Are you ever gonna let me drive
Truman, you're a menace
You can barely see over the wheel
Truman looks back out the window at the farms, leans back
This make you miss Alabama
(rolling window down, shakes his head) Not even a little bit
He leans his head out, closes his eyes
- Nelle pulls their car to the side of the   which fronts the
We recognize the  as the one in which Nancy Clutter was found dead (20 years old) sits in a  parked up the driveway
marks the perimeter of the property
Truman and Nelle get out of their car, stand at the foot of the driveway, gazing at the lonely farmhouse
- gorgeous fall day
Crowds of kids arriving at school
Many are
As Truman and Nelle walk toward the kids, some look warily at Truman and give him a wide berth
Hello
Kids back away
Nelle notices
She leaves Truman, walks up to a group of
Morning
#1 Hi
Can any of you tell me where 'd find Laura Kinney
#1 Oh, um
The girl glances toward the school entrance where (who found Nancy Clutter's body) walks with   (tall, 17)
(gently) Is that her
With the tall boy
#2 Yeah
With Danny Burke
Danny Burke
(Girl #2 nods) Thank you
As Nelle leaves, Girl #1 turns to her friend: #2 Oh, quiet yourself, Janice
Nelle sees Truman on his way toward Laura, calls out -- Truman
Truman -- Truman doesn't hear
She watches Truman approach them
Laura backs away
Danny leads her off
Nelle walks over to Truman, looks at him for several moments
These folks live their lives in a particular way
You need to consider adapting yourself to that fact
What -- -- 'm gonna find out where those two kids live
Maybe you'll let me do that alone
Nelle leaves
On Truman, as the bell rings and the mass of teenagers starts to enter the school
: ,   - Truman walks alone, sees the Gilbart Funeral Home
He removes his hat, slips past the few people standing outside
- Warm but slightly tacky
Some people are engaged in hushed conversation at the reception area
Truman slips past, into the back room
,    - No people, low light
Four   at the back of the room
Truman walks over slowly
After a moment, he checks to make sure he's alone
Then he    of one of the caskets
It's Bonnie Clutter's body, in a long-sleaved navy- blue dress; but her head is wrapped in layers and layers of white cotton gauze, and lacquered with a shiny substance -- like an enormous cocoon
Truman stares
: , '  - Truman on the  to Jack in Brooklyn
One of Truman's trunks is open, displaying bottles of liquor, packaged and tinned gourmet food, and stacks of unused yellow legal pads
He drinks, standing at the window
( ) think  scared a friend of yours this morning
He came looking for you while  was writing
You hate my friends
wouldn't say hate
So long as they don't knock on my door
saw the bodies today
Which
The Clutters
looked inside the coffins
That's horrifying
It comforts me -- something so horrifying it's freeing
It's a relief
Normal life falls away
(beat) But, then,  was never much for normal life -- No, you weren't
People here won't talk to me
They want someone like you, like Nelle
Me they hate
can't think of a single quality share with Nelle
Well -- Maybe manliness
My point exactly
It's why  left the Midwest in the first place
knew  could only find someone like you in New York City
On Truman, gazing at the    below
: ,  - sweeps the sidewalk
There are in his shop window
picks up a   at the intersection of a and the paved
over the Arkansas river
Below them, men are sifting the riverbed with nets, moving slowly downstream
: ,  - Nelle waits by the
The   open and Truman emerges
He is   --   , He walks toward Nelle, then  as if he's a runway model, walks away, turns again and walks back
He stops a few feet in front of her
Nelle refuses to smile
Let's go
: - Danny Burke walks down the road with a bookbag over his shoulder
Nelle approaches him, Truman keeps his distance
Danny
(Danny stops) Would you mind terribly if  walked with you for a bit
He shrugs
They walk together
: - Laura opens door to Truman and Nelle
,  - Nelle and Laura Kinney sit at the table
Truman stands at the counter
thought you were from the  with your long coat
Is that so
That's why  ran off
've been getting a lot of that lately
Truman smiles
Laura smiles back, amused, a bit comforted
It's fine talking to you all
Practically nobody around here wants to talk since what happened
Folks have been through a rough patch
Including you
(Laura nods) Nancy was your best friend
She was my best friend
They're quiet for a few moments
How has Danny been
Pretty shattered
Nothing terrible ever happened to him before
Nancy just started wearing his ring again after this huge fight -- Mr
Clutter was trying to get her to end it 'cause Danny's Catholic
What were the Clutters
Methodist
Danny was the last person at the house that night
That's why Mr
Dewey's keeps interviewing him -- they don't think he had anything to do with it -- just to see if he remembers anything unusual and all
People in town seem to wonder if he was involved
That's been real hard for Danny
Oh, it's the hardest -- when people have a notion about you and it's impossible to convince them otherwise
Since  was a child folks have thought they had me pegged because of the way  look and the way  talk
They're always wrong
(looks at her) Do you know what  mean
Laura stares at him and nods
He's clearly struck a chord
want to show you something
She goes in the door to the
They see her through the   getting something from her , which is stacked with books
Truman whispers to Nelle: Not one person here understands her
Laura returns
She hugs a   to her chest
After a moment, she holds it out to them
Maybe you'll get a better picture of Nancy
And the family
What is this
It's her diary
: /
- Nelle and Truman walk quickly back to the hotel
Nelle has the diary open
"Danny here tonight and we watched So nice just having him sit with us
Left at eleven
-- He's the only one  really love
" She turns the page
The rest of the book is blank
And that was that
The end of a life
: , '  - Nelle typing
Truman is propped up on pillows on the bed, scrunching his eyes to remember what was said that afternoon, then writing quickly on one of many   , handing the pages of interview dialogue to Nelle
He's exhausted
Nelle stops typing a moment, looks through the pages Truman has handed her: "Shattered
" "Pretty shattered
Nothing terrible ever happened to him before
" He pushes some pillows aside and lies down
have 94 percent recall of all conversations
94 percent
've tested myself
(scans some of what he's written) hate that you're better than me at this
She turns back to the typewriter
She types
Truman lies there, looking at the ceiling for a few moments
He closes his eyes
Nelle knows without looking -- Don't you dare close your eyes on my bed
No answer
She keeps typing
Stand up and walk out that door
Go to your room if you're gonna sleep
Truman
Truman
Nelle turns to look at him
He's asleep
She goes back to typing
Under her breath: Crap
,   - Truman drinks coffee alone, sleepy
He takes a of -  from his jacket pocket and shakes it over his
He replaces the bottle in his jacket
Nelle walks into the lobby from upstairs, heads for Truman
What right do you have being tired
You were snoring blissfully -- don't snore -- -- while  lay there, hating you -- You don't hate me
Not much
(She sits
Truman holds out a ) What
(takes it, looks) Marie Dewey
We've got somewhere to go for Thanksgiving supper
Apparently Detective Foxy's wife has a better opinion of me than Detective Foxy
: - Ding Dong
We see the   open
Reveal   -- pretty, 35, dressed primly -- and her two boys:
(9), and  (6), lurking behind, curious
Marie smiles
You came
Reverse onto Nelle
and Truman, dressed in a  , hair neatly combed, like an Exeter schoolboy attending a funeral
Nelle smiles
Hi
Nelle nudges Truman, who hands over his gifts: a &, and a  of
(soberly) Thank you for having us
(mock serious) Thank you
(then:) Get yourselves in here
(turns and walks into the house) Alvin
Get your pants on
They're here
On Nelle and Truman, surprised
,   - plays on the television
No one's watching
We can  Alvin on the phone in his study at the back of the house
,  - Truman and Marie at the stove
Nelle sits at the kitchen table
Truman has his jacket off and an apron on, as does Marie
They are peering into a   -
Marie is shaking in drops of
More
More
Alvin will hate this
Yes, but we who know the truth will love it
(laughs) have to stop
(then) cannot believe you're from New Orleans
miss it so much
only lived there for a short while but my Mama was born and bred
You know something -- Alvin pretends he doesn't know who you are, but the minute you came to town he read your books
He had one of his men pick up "Breakfast at Tiffany's" in Kansas City 'cause it's banned from the library here
What did Mr
Dewey think
He liked it more than he's willing to admit
How very foxy
Marie smiles at that word used to describe her husband
Mama would've put in half the bottle by now
Beat
Alright, one more shake
,  - Alvin walks toward the kitchen
He smokes
He looks exhausted
He hears  of laughter
,  - Alvin enters
They all stop laughing and look at him
nods to Truman and Nelle
Hello
Hi
Silence
Marie sips her drink
How you doing, foxy
She cracks up
,   - The remains of dinner
The kids have left
The bottle of & sits on the table, half-empty
Marie's a bit drunk
Everyone's is clean except for Alvin's, on which sits a  of uneaten black-eyed peas
Truman is mid-story
was writing the script as they were filming, all that time in Italy
'd work like mad all day long and then dash down to the bar around midnight to hand in the next day's scenes
Humphrey had just about moved into the hotel bar -- (whispers to Alvin) Humphrey Bogart
Alvin knows
-- where he and John drank every night -- (to Alvin) John Huston
Alvin knows
-- and  mean drank, like famished water buffaloes
Well -- 'd only just handed them the final scene when the bellhop told me  had a phone call
It was my stepfather, Joe Capote, calling to say that my mother had died
flew home to New York -- terribly distraught -- but when  got to the apartment  could see that Joe was in even worse shape than  was
He grabbed my hands and sat me down at the kitchen table, and he said to me, "Talk
Talk about anything, any subject in the world
Don't worry whether it will interest me or not
Just talk so  won't break down
" And  did
He couldn't bear to be alone with his thoughts
It was too painful
It's quiet for a moment, then Marie looks at Alvin
It's been a hard couple weeks for Alvin
He and Herb Clutter were good friends
From church
Marie -- Oh come on, Alvin
These are good people
Finally, Dewey looks at Truman and Nelle
,  - Alvin shows Truman and Nelle the    from the Clutter murders
We see the four corpses,  and , the bloody footprints in the Clutter basement
Truman and Nelle stare at the photos of Nancy and Kenyon
Then, quietly -- Who would put a pillow under the boy's head just to shoot him
Why would they tuck Nancy in
(surprised by the insight) want to know the same thing
Truman hands Nelle one of the photos
She looks at it -- Twisted notion of tenderness
: - Truman and Nelle are leaving
Alvin and Marie stand in the front door
Nelle kisses Marie
Thank you
So many of my friends would love to meet you
That'd be fine -- (to Dewey) You don't have to worry
'm not going to write about this until everything's over
'm not worried
know what room you're in at the hotel
And  know where you live in Brooklyn
Truman smiles
: -  - : "Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas
" Main Street,   in the
The  , with Santa Claus  in the window and a "
" sign
: - Truman and Nelle walk with   (70, very frail) on the Clutter property
Apples rot on the ground, the trees are bare, signs of disrepair are beginning to weather the house
(re the apples) 'd of picked them up but  haven't been myself
Mind you,  make the walk out here every day, check the house, make sure the pipes don't freeze -- that sort of item
The least  can do for Mr
Clutter
How long have you worked here
1940 -- a lotta years
The wife too, cleaning the house
Cooking
Well, she's marvelous
Lunch was wonderful
(ignoring this) She had a hard job after what all happened
Cleaning
burned most of the rest -- mattresses -- too far of a mess
(then, looks at them) 've asked around some -- if anyone's looking for a strong hand
They don't know what to say
Finally, he looks away
don't think they'll be able to sell the place till they catch the ones that did it
(beat) That's what  hear anyhow
Silence as the three of them look out over the barren fields
, '  - Just the bed-frame -- the mattress is gone
Truman and Nelle find her Bible on the bedside table, her bookmark, see the painting of Jesus walking on water
Pete Holt stands off to the side, waiting patiently
: ,   - Through the front window we see a Christmas tree in the lobby
, '  - Jazzy Christmas music on the
Nelle sits in the big armchair with a drink
She laughs
We  Jack on the phone: You're celebrating
We see Truman wearing a     with white lace, bare legs
He's on the phone and walking, for Nelle's enjoyment, back and forth, like a runway model
Remember Nelle's manuscript she sent me in New York
Mockingbird
Killing a Mockingbird
You said it was good
And  was right
She just heard Lipincott wants to publish it
(pause) Well
Jesus
That's terrific
Tell her congratulations
Congratulations
(covers phone, mouths to Nelle:) Jealous
Just promise you'll be home by Christmas
can't leave now Jack --  mean it was hard at first, but now 'm practically the mayor
He vamps
Nelle laughs
Alright
want to come home --  do
Though if they catch whoever did this, who knows what -- 'll probably be here til next Christmas
Right
'll let you go
Jack, we'll go away this spring to write
Maybe Spain
Alright, Truman
Bye
(hangs up) The poor boy misses me
Goes to the mini-bar to fix a drink
Truman
Nelle
You remember when we were kids
was never a kid
was born fully formed
had no idea what a homosexual was
But  knew whatever they were, you were one of 'em
Truman puts down his drink and marches out of the room, shuts the door
Nelle's unsure whether she really insulted him
From the , we hear a  , and a  saying: (
) Oh
Uh
Oh
Excuse us
Truman runs back in, shuts door
They crack up
: - ,  , Tasteful Christmas lights strung on the
on the
,   - Truman, Nelle, Marie and Alvin
Drinks
on the coffee table in front of Alvin
He's distracted, smoking
Marie holds a ' , checking what Truman says with what's written there
(quickly, as if reciting) -- girdle up -- no extra bulges -- if you're dressed right for him when he gets home, the evening should be smooth sailing
Bon voyage, gals
can't believe you got this whole page --  only read it to you once
've trained myself
trained myself
Truman looks at Nelle
have 94 percent recall
94 percent recall
(laughing) You cut that out
Alvin stubs out his cigarette -- though it still burns
He stands
You believe that Alvin
Impressive
He walks out
Silence
'm sorry
He's upset
(stubs out cigarette) -- smoking three packs a day
(then) Two men did it
They know who
One of them used to have a cellmate who gave him up for the thousand dollar reward
They passed through Kansas City last week writing bad checks -- by the time Alvin's boys got up there they'd skipped out again
Where to
They have no idea
,   - Christmas dinner
Truman, Nelle, Marie and Alvin have just sat down
They wait for the Dewey boys -- Alvin Jr
and Paul
We hear them in the living room horsing around
Alvin
Paul
Now
It's quiet for a second
Then something crashes and breaks
Damnit
(gets up, goes) Come here
Alvin
Phone
(
) Alvin Jr
Get over here
(
) Dad, the phone
(
) Paul
Back to the table
Dewey returns to the dining room, pushing Paul ahead of him
Sit
Alvin Jr
enters
Dad
Tell them we're at dinner, Alvin
Dad
Not now, Alvin
Alvin Jr
leaves
We hear the  being
Alvin Jr
returns and sits
They all get ready to say grace, then: You need to call the Chief of Police in Las Vegas when you have a minute
Everyone looks at Dewey
: ,   - we hear the voice of a
(
) This is  radio, Garden City
friendly broadcast from a friendly place
Our lead story: Slowly, the sounds of a  emerge in the background

Truman moves from the car into the large crowd
Old ladies; ranchers; local businessmen; moms with kids; journalists citizens; photographers lined up at the bottom of the
We hear snippets of conversation as we pass
is being interviewed by a ; a standing with a ; a - man in an overcoat  silently
Truman approaches Nelle and Marie Dewey, standing together at the curb in front of the courthouse, near the photographers
They are talking quietly, turn to Truman -- Hey
We hear    at the south end of the square of   enters the square
It pulls around to the front of the courthouse
spill out of the lead and rear
Nye gets out of the second car
He opens the back door
The crowd falls
Two state troopers get   -- handcuffed, pale -- out of the car and lead him up the steps
Dewey and Church open the third car's back door
Silence
They retrieve
Perry is extremely , , , with the dark skin and hair of his American Indian mother, and the pug features of his Irish father
As he stands, he has trouble straightening his stubby , as if they are arthritic
Truman stares
(whispers to Truman) Motorcycle accident
He broke them and they never healed right
(Truman looks at her) Alvin told me
Truman watches Perry, transfixed
Perry seems terrified of the crowd, all the faces, like a child
Perry scans the crowd
His eyes fall on Truman
Truman and Perry look at each other as Perry is led slowly past
At the top of the steps the   slam shut
: '  (4TH    ) - : Truman knocks on the door, a , a , and a   in his hand
On the door it says "' - "
Dorothy Sanderson opens the door
Truman Capote

My friend Jack mailed me the book you wanted

Perry doesn't see him -- he's resting his head on a small table, the tip of his  in his mouth
The chair seems too tall for Perry
He looks like a lonely kindergartner, told to take his afternoon nap
After several moments, Dorothy enters, flustered: Oh
Truman
meant in there
(points to living room) um
Perry sits up quickly, rubs his legs
It's the women's cell
It's hardly ever used
But they wanted to, um, separate
Please
Let's sit in the living room

She gathers a tray of Truman's , and
Come
She goes -- Truman starts to follow, then lingers
They put you in the women's cell

Well

She's scared of me

He draws on a piece of paper with a   -- a rather good picture of a Truman sits with Nelle, watching Perry -- (murmurs) His feet don't touch the floor
In the matter of the State of Kansas v
Richard Eugene Hickock and Perry Edward Smith this Court has been informed by counsel -- Mr
Weeks -- that defendants wish to waive their right to Preliminary Hearing
Mr
Hickock, is that your wish
Hickock looks at Weeks
Weeks nods
Hickock stands

Yes
Hickock sits
Truman whispers to Nelle -- Why are they doing that
Mr
Smith

Judge Tate looks at him for a moment -- So noted

Much talk
Truman watches Perry and Dick through the forest of bodies

Perry draws on a scrap of paper at the small table
Dorothy watches from the door to the living room

Was it your choice to waive the hearing
Perry doesn't answer
Dorothy checks her watch, leaves
Truman takes a bottle of   out of his pocket
You still need some
(Perry doesn't move) Give me your hand
Perry extends his hand through the bars
As Truman shakes some aspirin into it -- could kill you if you got too close
Perry puts the aspirin in his mouth,  , holds out his hand for more
Truman gives him more, which Perry puts in his pocket for later
Would you like some water
Perry shakes his head
Silence
Mrs
Sanderson lent you my book -- He said we'd curry favor with the Judge if we waived our rights
Who did
The lawyer
Okay
Truman nods, not wanting to push this any further
Perry picks up the book, holds it out through the bars
Your picture's undignified
People recall first impressions
What's been your first impression
You want something
From you

Walter's gonna be home soon

(to reporter) To answer your question, 'm following "Breakfast at Tiffany's" by blazing a different path -- by inventing an entirely new kind of writing: the non-fiction novel
You have a subject
Truman takes a last sip of his drink -- utterly serious now
On the night of November 14, two men broke into a quite farmhouse in Kansas and murdered an entire family
Why did they do that
It's been suggested that this subject is tawdry -- it's not worthy of literature
disagree
Two worlds exist in this country -- the quiet conservative life, and the life of those two men -- the underbelly, the criminally violent
Those worlds converged that bloody night
spent the past three months interviewing everyone in Kansas touched by that violence
spent hours talking to the killers -- and 'll spend more
(waiter brings his drink) Researching this work has changed my life, altered my point of view about almost everything
think those who read it will be similarly affected
(he sips) Such a book can only be written by a journalist who has mastered the techniques of fiction -- You're speaking of yourself
You're really very clever

He squints his eyes, concentrating
Jack enters, delivers a
Truman doesn't notice

He can't find what he needs
The phone
: ,   - Jack and Truman walk
Perry's decided to appeal
He claims their attorney was incompetent -- that he never raised the issue of temporary insanity
So you find them a new lawyer
They're facing execution in six weeks, Jack
They need someone to argue whether or not that's right
Okay
'd also like to see them alive, yes, thank you very much
need to hear their story
They walk in silence for a few moments
If you met him you'd understand
It's as if no-one's ever asked him a single question about himself
He's so
damaged -- and strange -- unexplored
(then) don't trust this Hickock fellow
Perry's the only person who can describe to me what happened that night
need to hear him say it
Just be careful what you do to get what you want
'm finding them a lawyer
Truman
You're finding yourself a lawyer

Feed em good
We'll be feeding Perry Smith in the infirmary soon if he don't eat
Get the food in through his arm
What are you talking about

But it's not his right to kill himself
It's the People's right
The People of this State
And that's who  work for, the People
You can write any of this down
No one told me
Yah
Won't eat
When can  see him
(checking desk calendar) How about you come back Thursday
No
That's no good
need to see them now, then whenever  want for as long as  want
Not how we do things here
Pause
see
Truman glances at the campaign stickers, the young prison guard, then back at Krutch
understand what a burden unlimited visitation might be -- on this institution, and on the People who pay for it
want to be clear that don't expect the citizens of Leavenworth County to have to shoulder that burden
Truman reaches into his jacket, pulls from it an with
He lays it on the desk
To be dispensed as you see fit
Krutch is stone-faced as he regards the money

In one of them we notice Lowell Lee Andrews (20, white, spectacled,  ) peering at his own face 4 inches from a mirror
Dick is leaning against the bars of his own cell
He smiles
My hero
Hello
Thanks for your help with the lawyer
That's fine
You must be desperate for a story to come all the way out here
Mr
Capote
You're entitled to go in
You may, um, go in
If you wish
Truman hesitates for a second
You want to see Perry
Go ahead
Thank you
Truman walks to the next cell
Ask me, he's just trying to prove the insanity defense
Truman sees Perry, gaunt, lying on his cot, almost comatose
Perry's rather striking drawing of a sits propped on his table

Truman sits in the chair across from him
Perry hands him a photo of his mother
Perry speaks quietly
Before she had us
Before she started drinking
Who took care of you as a child
Orphanage
Me and Linda
That's your sister
Perry nods
Truman waits for more
It doesn't come
We're not so different as you might think
was abandoned repeatedly as a child
My mama'd drag me along to some new town so she could take up with another man she'd met
Night after night she'd lock me in the hotel room -- Mama'd turn the latch and tell the staff not to let me out no matter what
was terrified -- 'd scream my head off -- till finally 'd collapse on the carpet next to the door and fall asleep
After years of this she just left me with relatives in Alabama
Who raised you up
My Aunts
(Perry nods) That's when  met Nelle -- she lived next door
(looks again at the photo, hands it back) Your mother was Indian
Cherokee
Drinking was not a good thing for her
No tolerance for it
And your father
No tolerance for him either
Truman's laughs, surprised by the joke, though it's unclear whether Perry meant it as one
He stares at Perry
What  can't decide is if you understand how fascinating you are
Perry doesn't respond, then -- 'm sorry about your tie
They took it away from me because we're all on suicide watch
It's why the lights stay on at night
hope we're past that now
You had me worried
Okay
don't care about the tie
It's just a pity because it looked so good on you
Perry leans in, motions toward Dick's cell, lowers his voice -- Be careful of Ricardo
think he wants you all to himself
Alright -- But he's naturally mendacious -- not to be trusted -- if he had a hundred dollars he'd steal a stick of chewing gum
You wouldn't
Perry shakes his head
Then, Truman nods toward Perry's notebooks
want to take your notebooks with me --  want to read them
Perry hesitates
If  leave here without understanding you, the world will always see you as a monster
don't want that -- don't see you that way

One day  said to him, "Mom's dead

He wants so badly to be taken seriously, to be held in some esteem
with Nelle, in pajamas, sitting on the porch of her home in Monroeville, smoking
'   - Do you
Do  what
Hold him in esteem
Well
he's a gold mine
mean he's told me his entire life, and now it's all here for me to write down -- All of the history  need
His entire life in this Diary
His dead mother
brother and sister killed themselves
You tell him your mama did the same thing
tell him everything
We've been talking our heads off the past month
Sometimes, when  think how good my book can be,  can hardly breathe
Huh
(finds what he wants) Here's what  wanted to read to you: "If Called Upon to Make a Speech:" -- this is exactly what  was talking about -- a speech just in case he's ever recognized for an achievement: "If Called Upon to Make a Speech: can't remember what  was going to say for the life of me
don't think ever before have so many people been so directly responsible for my being so very, very glad
It's a wonderful moment and a rare one
Thank you
" (beat) There's an exclamation point on the end of that thank you, in case you didn't catch it
(silence) Where'd you go
We hear Nelle exhale her cigarette
Christ
guess it stopped being funny
never said it was

She leaves
An uncomfortable silence
Then: You're nothing if not hard-working
You look good, healthy again
Not a chance
Dewey taps a cigarette out of his pack
've decided on a title for my book
think you'll like it -- very masculine
"In Cold Blood
" (lights the cigarette) That refers to the crime or the fact that you're still talking to the criminals
The former, among other things

They eat for a moment
Then: 've been wanting to ask if you'll let me look at your investigation notes
That lawyer you helped find for your friends got them a hearing at the Kansas Supreme Court -- heard this morning
-- on the issue of inadequate counsel
Alvin
Do you not want me to look at your notes
You are permitted to say no
(rises, takes out wallet) 'll tell you what: if those boys get off, 'm coming to Brooklyn to hunt you down
Truman can't decide whether Dewey is kidding or not
Dewey puts money on the table

He walks away
Over his shoulder: Call Roy Church
He'll show you what you want to see

Truman watches for a few moments, then Perry looks at him
,  , '  - The Guard locks Truman inside with Perry
Thank you
Truman looks at the Guard -- he leaves
It was as much for me as for anyone
couldn't bear the thought of losing you so soon
We're going to be able to use your book for our case
You'll write we never got to raise our insanity plea
You wrote how terrible the lawyer was
haven't written a word yet
Beat
What have you been doing
Research
Waiting to talk to you
All right
had hoped -- What are you calling it
The book
(looks directly at him) have no idea
Pause
If 'm going to write about you -- if 'm going to determine how to write about you -- you need to tell me about that night at the Clutter house
Perry just looks at him
Perry
Perry shakes his head
Why
Do you worry what 'll think
Perry looks away
long moment
Is that it
Silence
Then: Dick says you know Elizabeth Taylor
know a lot of people
Truman gives up for now
Sees the on the desk
What is that you keep drawing
You must hate having to come to this place -- Perry,  have invitations to be in Morocco, Greece
choose to be here
Those people have everything, all their prayers have been answered, yet they're more desperate than ever
prefer to be here with you
(looks at Truman; evenly) was ten,  wet the bed, the nuns at the orphanage hated the smell
First month one of them found me shivering -- just trying to get through the night
The Sister pulled back the covers and shined her flashlight to see what 'd did
The sheets were wet
She hit me so many times with that flashlight she broke it
(he shrugs) That night  dreamed about the yellow bird
Tall
Yellow like the sun
It picked me up and it clawed the Nun's eyes and it lifted me into the sky
They look at each other

Be patient with me
How long is that gonna take
Why don't you try leaving him alone for a while
Come to Spain
You can always visit him later

Well, 'm off
've got my own writing to do
Do it in Brooklyn
Wait for me
Too many people around

brought you some things, but  have to fly back East
When
An hour
'm sorry
You can't
'm sorry
Who are you going there to see -- (
) (from next cell) Capote, get it straight in your book -- we never intended on killing that family -- told him that
(
) No premeditation -- told him
Perry searches the cell for something else to give to Truman to keep him there
Then, he stops
He has nothing left to give, and is unwilling to talk about that night at the Clutters
He becomes very still
Truman speaks gently -- Your writings are magnificent hope these help you do more
No response
Truman places the books on the floor just outside Perry's cell -- Perry's writings in one stack and the new dictionaries in another right next to it
have so much material -- from the trial, from our visits, your journals
have to organize it all, and have to start the process of writing
(no response) 'll visit soon
Perhaps this fall
(backing away) miss you already
Write me every five minutes
He turns and goes
We stay with Perry as Truman leaves
We hear Dick speak to Truman

It's that good

This first half is astonishing

Shawn has a stack of manuscript pages on his desk

was planning to visit this fall, see -- think you need to talk to him now
And we all need to see how this ends for the final part
can't finish the book till  know what happens
If Perry and Dick are executed it's one thing -- and if not, well -- Truman
You got your ending -- really don't know -- The Kansas court denied their appeal
It came over the wire on Friday
You need to talk to Perry now
He'll be dead by September
'm sorry,  know how much you've come to care about him
Truman is completely immobile

Right
Yes
Right
want to set up a reading for you in the fall, in New York
We'll build some interest, and we'll publish in the fall

You are the hardest worker, the most unsung talent  know
As Nelle passes by on her way to London to sell her book which needs no selling, may a little of her success rub off on both of us
Jack laughs
Here, here
Nelle tries to smack Truman but can't catch him
The song changes to a slow one
Jack and Truman dance sweetly together
Nelle sits on the sand and watches
: ,    - Breakfast
Truman and Nelle are sitting -- Nelle has a small envelope in her hand
Truman is obviously uncomfortable
As Jack delivers a platter of omelettes to the table: (to Truman) When was the last time you wrote back to him
don't know
What's this
letter for your boyfriend  was asked to deliver
From Perry
Let's have it
Jack sits
Nelle opens the letter, reads: "Dear Friend Truman
Where are you
Read this item in a medical dictionary: "Death by hanging is caused by asphyxia, by fracture of the cervical vertebrae, by laceration of the trachea
" Not too comforting as we lost our appeal
Missing you -- alone and desirous of your presence
Your amigo, Perry
" Pause
Mr
Shawn told me about the court decision yesterday
was wondering why you were in such a good mood
Surely,  thought, it's not because  finished my little book
That's a terrible thing to say
Jack looks out at the ocean
(to no one in particular) used to write him all the time
've been so focused lately on the book
: - Truman and Nelle carry her bags down the front walk toward a waiting
Jack says 'm using Perry, but he also thinks  fell in love with him when  was in Kansas
How both of those things can be true is beyond me
Did you
Fall in love with him
Silence as they load the bags into the trunk
Truman
-- don't know how to answer that
It's as if Perry and  started life in the same house
One day he stood up and walked out the back door while walked out the front
With some different choices, he's the man might have become
Are you kidding me
Truman shrugs, doesn't answer
Nelle kisses him
Be nice to Jack
Sometimes  think he's what  like about you best
(smiles) 'll see you at the reading in New York
The sixteenth
Nelle gets in the taxi, then leans her head out the window
Truman
Honestly
Are you going back to Kansas because you care about Perry or because you need information before he's killed
Can't it be both
No
don't think it can be
She drives away
Truman watches her go
He turns back up toward the house, stops a moment to pick a  from the bushes at the front gate

He delivers it to Perry, then walks off
Perry is confused
He hears  approaching, but can't see who it is

) Hey, buddy
Thanks

" Other books sit next to Perry on the cot
Among them -- 's " ", also " " -- What was he in jail for
They said it was not paying his taxes
But really for being an outsider -- refusing to go along
Perry nods, looks at the other books
You don't have to read any of these if you don't want to
But  thought you'd like something decent
You're much too smart for adventure magazines
Through the bars of Perry's cell, we can see the enter Lowell Lee Andrew's cell (diagonally across the corridor)
The   appears at Perry's cell
Lock-down while Lowell goes to solitary
Nobody in or out

Truman looks at Perry, then back to the Guard

(Throughout this scene, we see in the background, across the corridor, the mostly obscured cell of Andrews
We see his incredibly   being shackled, his belongings being packed in boxes
) Everyone says he's a genius
don't think he's a genius
He's rich and he went to college -- like any of us would've if we got the chance
He came home for Christmas and shot his parents -- -- in front of the television
You remember the story -- They were watching Father Knows Best
They look at each other and smile
Then: won't be sorry to see him go
Always correcting my grammar
They watch Andrews being shackled in the background
Now -- Dick and me -- we're next in line
Truman regards Perry, who looks down
'm so sorry 've been away
It was a long time
know
wish you could come next week, when they take him out to the Corner, but the whole prison shuts down
have to be in New York anyway
Perry nods
How's the book going
Very slowly
Will you show it to me

Andrews is led out, arms and legs shackled, into the corridor
Keep your head high, buddy
Alright now
or they won't be able to rope you under your fat fucking chin
Andrews is led past Perry's cell
He looks in at Perry
Next
Andrews shuffles down the hall
Perry watches him go
On Truman watching Perry
We hear the  slam shut
: - Packed
Nelle stands with William Shawn, who receives well- wishers

(loudly, over the hubbub) Hello Hollywood
That's quite a bundle you sold your book for
Nelle is embarrassed, mostly for Baron, to have the issue of money brought up publicly
Well
Baron moves past, Nelle smiles politely, whispers to Shawn
What a gentleman
,   - Truman sits alone
In the background, we can  the noise of the huge crowd gathering in the theater
Truman wears his : a gorgeous dark green Knize over a black cashmere turtleneck sweater, and horn-rimmed (which we've never seen him wear before)
He's frozen with anticipation, nervousness
After several moments a   opens the door
Mr
Capote
Can  get you anything
No
(clears his throat) Thank you
The assistant leaves
We hear the crowd quiet down
Truman rises slowly, walks through the door to the backstage area
We hear William Shawn on stage
(
) Welcome New Yorkers
/ - Shawn pauses briefly for a laugh that doesn't come
Truman continues walking toward the backstage curtains
(
) Thank you for coming to the first public reading, the first offering of any kind, of Truman Capote's new work "In Cold Blood
" Our magazine -- Truman walks on stage
Loud applause
Shawn sees him, slinks back to his seat
Truman walks over to the podium, takes in the enormous crowd
Once it is completely quiet: Hello
My name is Truman Capote
People laugh and applaud loudly

Utter silence except for his voice
(
) The village of Holcomb stands on the high wheat plains of western Kansas, a lonesome area that other Kansans call "out there
" Until one morning in mid-November 1959, few Americans -- in fact, few Kansans -- had ever heard of Holcomb
Like the waters of the [Arkansas] river, like the motorists on the highway
exceptional happenings had never stopped there

The audience completely still
The four coffins, which quite filled the small, flower-crowded parlor, were to be sealed at the funeral services -- very understandably, for the effect
was disquieting
Nancy wore her dress of cherry-red velvet, her brother a bright plaid shirt; the parents were more sedately attired, Mr
Clutter in navy-blue flannel, his wife in navy-blue crepe; and -- and it was this especially that lent the scene an awful aura -- the head of each was completely encased in cotton, a swollen cocoon twice the size of an ordinary blown- up balloon, and the cotton, because it had been sprayed with a glossy substance, twinkled like Christmas- tree snow

The audience transfixed
Imagination, of course, can open any door -- turn the key and let terror walk right in
[One] Tuesday, at dawn, a carload of
strangers, ignorant of the local disaster -- were startled by what they saw as they crossed the prairies and passed through Holcomb: windows ablaze, almost every window in almost every house, and, in the brightly lit rooms, fully clothed people, even entire families, who had sat the whole night wide awake, watchful, listening
Of what were they frightened
"It might happen again
" He closes his manuscript
Several moments of , then thunderous

Packed with well-wishers drinking from bottles of , smoking, toasting, shouting to be heard
Truman in the corner with Christopher Isherwood, others, laughing
approaches, leans in
Your portrait of those men was terrifying
Terrifying
Thank you
Truman and Isherwood watch him walk away
Your hairpiece is terrifying
was going to say the same thing
Truman laughs loudly
We  Nelle look over from across the room at her friend having the time of his life
: ,  '  - Truman is hung over but immensely gratified
He's with Shawn
Everyone was there
Tennessee loved it
Of course he did
Should we do more
was terrified, but -- No, Now we get to withhold while everyone else talks
Let them do the work
Truman is barely able to suppress his excitement
This book is going to change everything
It'll change how people see you as a writer
It'll change how people write
You'll finish by October
think so
You know they're scheduled for next month
Hanging
Yes
'll commit as many issues as it takes to publish
Three
As many as it takes
'm flying to Kansas tomorrow
'll get Perry to talk -- Honestly, what's he got to lose
Truman smiles at the joke, then stops himself
It really is too awful
Institutionalized sadism
Shawn nods
You'll be able to finish now
As strange as it may sound to you, 'm going to miss him
Over black -- the sound of a  airplane -- loud, then passing

When did you hear
Perry looks up, mistaking Truman's state for shared enthusiasm
He smiles widely
Two days ago
The Guard opens the cell for Truman
Perry holds up one of the
It's what we've been waiting for stay of execution to make a federal appeal
Truman enters
Perry goes to him and hugs him tightly
All thanks to you
On Truman, shocked, being hugged
: ,  , '  - Truman sits on the bed, his coat still on, watching Perry -- hyped up, talking, walking around the cell
Kansas's had it in for me for ten years -- in prison the first time, at that trial, here
They can't corner me now
Not till the
Government says so -- Perry, sit down
For a minute
(Perry sits) need you to talk to me
We've got all the time in the world to talk
About everything
've been thinking about Ricardo
You need to stop sending him those trashy books
won't even mention the pornography
(getting up) realize he might have trouble grasping the literature you gave me, but those books only exacerbate the problem -- only 'heighten' or 'intensify' it
Maybe we should start him on a program
Perry
Give him the simple novels first -- Perry
Perry stops
know what exacerbate means
Okay
thought in case
There is not a word, or a sentence, or a concept, that you can illuminate for me
There is one singular reason that  keep coming here -- Truman -- November 14th, 1959
Three years ago
Three years
That's all  want to hear from you
Pause
've asked you not to -- (stands up) This is ridiculous
(to the Guard) 'm ready
(to Perry) have a plane to catch
found your sister in Tacoma
Maybe she'll talk to me about something useful
Don't go out there
The Guard lets Truman out of the cell
Please don't go out there
The Guard shuts the door
This is my work, Perry
'm working
When you want to tell me what  need to hear, you let me know
He walks off down the hall
The  slams shut

Through the window, we see playing on a    in the yard

They've never seen these pictures

She joins Truman again at the table
We see an   of the   -- Linda at age 8, Perry (5); their older sister, June; their brother Frank; and the parents: Florence (American Indian) and John (Irish) -- in front of their rundown truck on a desolate road
June's dead
Frank shot himself
Now Perry's did what he did
suppose 'm next
Some ruination will visit me
don't think life works that way
It does in this family
Truman turns the page
of Perry (3) and Linda and splashing in a big mud-puddle in the rain
Linda is smiling at Perry, who is naked, laughing
used to love him
He was my little doll
He turns the page
of Perry (6) and Linda sitting on the back steps of a shack, poking with a stick at something in the dirt
After a moment, she gets up, clears coffee cups
He scares me now
When was the last time you saw him
Ten years
She picks up the album to put it away
Do you think  could borrow one of those pictures
(hands it to him) Take the whole thing
don't want'em anymore
(then) Just
Perry doesn't know where live
He thinks we're still in Portland
Please don't tell him we're not
(he already has) Alright
Don't be taken in by my brother
He's got this sensitive side he'll show
You believe he's gentle, so easily hurt
But he'd just as soon kill you as shake your hand

Hello handsome
Hickock just stares at him
Truman, unnerved, moves on to Perry's cell

He sees Truman and stops
He stands
The Row Guard approaches
You want to go in
Truman regards Perry for a few moments, then: Yes The Guard unlocks the door
Perry    toward it
The Guard  it shut
What's the name of your book
No response
Perry can barely control his anger
What's the name of your book
don't
What's the name of your book
don't know what you're talking about
Perry picks up a cut-out  from the  Times from his desk
He reads
"Truman Capote read last night before a packed audience from his non-fiction book
" He looks at Truman
More
(reads) "The true-crime novel tells of killers Richard Hickock and Perry Smith, who brutally murdered a Kansas family three years ago
" Who sent that to you
Perry doesn't answer
Who sent that to you
That's not your goddamn business
It is my business, because it's not true
The organizers of the reading needed a title
They picked one -- a sensational one,  admit -- to attract a crowd
They picked it
Yes
That's not your title
haven't chosen one yet
Perry stares at him, not believing
How could  choose -- You pretend to be my friend
How could  choose a title when you still haven't told me what happened that night
How could
couldn't possibly
Long pause
Truman reaches in his breast pocket and extracts a  (the one of Perry and Linda splashing in the puddle

He hands it through the bars to Perry
Perry takes it
She misses you
Perry looks at the photo
After a few moments, Truman turns to the Guard
It's alright

Truman enters
The Guard locks up, walks away
Perry is still looking at the
'm sorry
should have told you what they made me call the book

The truth is,  can't help wanting to be
(silence, then:) You don't have to tell me anything if you don't want to
Perry looks at the photo of himself and his sister for a long time
Look at my belly
Perry sits on the bed
Then, almost to himself: There must be something wrong with us
To do what we did
Truman waits him out, sitting on the chair
Finally, Perry looks at him
When Perry speaks, it is quietly, completely matter-of-fact
We heard there was ten thousand dollars in that house
Once we'd tied up everybody and searched all over,  knew the guy who told us about it was wrong
There wasn't any money
But Dick wouldn't believe it
He went tearing through the house again, banging on the walls, looking for a safe
He said when he was done, he was going to come up to Nancy's room and have his way with her wouldn't allow it
told him that

Perry sits quietly on the edge of Nancy's bed

Dick came to get me and we turned out the lights and went down to the basement, where we had Mr
Clutter and the boy
Dick kept saying "No witnesses

We'd drive all night, they'd never find us

He asked if his wife and daughter were alright and  said they were fine, they were ready to go to sleep
told him it wasn't long till morning when somebody would find them
(beat) He was looking at me
Just
looking at me
Looking at my eyes
Like he expects me to kill him -- expects me to be the kind of person who would kill him
was thinking -- this nice man, he's scared of me

You got the letter
Yes

You got that right
Silence

What 've seen hasn't been so nice to look at -- but  guess it's better than nothing
