Now them first two, you gonna get your money's worth

They hard as steel and emerald green as emerald green fuckin' comes

Ex-cons at a table, riffing through Bud's cash
and  , 29, enters
Dope-thin, bloodshot eyes
He looks at Bud
Bud looks at him
Ray clicks on the  and opens a beer
: Evening news
The storm outside alters the reception
And today, thirty-one year old Gary Plauche pleaded innocent by reason of insanity, to charges of second-degree murder in the slaying of accused sex offender, Jeffrey Doucett
Bud watches Ray empty a gram of coke onto the bar
Using a credit card, Ray starts chopping lines
The  continues throughout the scene
() District Court Judge Frank Salia, scheduled the trial one year to the day after Doucett was first arrested
Grace hefts a lock box to the counter, removes a drawer of emeralds
Bud  packed carelessly underneath, uncut What do you got there
Diamonds
That's thirty grand
Out the door
You interested
Ain't got the scratch right now
But  am interested
And the volume of the  now becomes more apparent
As a result of numerous threats made weeks ago, tight security surrounded the courthouse
However, missing from today's hearing, was the arresting officer
Bud has been tuning out the  distraction
until that last statement
He sneaks a look
From East Baton Rouge Sheriff's office
wave of static scrambles the picture
When it clears
Police Lieutenant, Bud Carter
Bud is stunned
younger photo of Bud, clean shaven -
- Rain pours
beat-up '  is parked in the distance
'  - : Signal wavers
It's archive footage of Baton Rouge Airport

Doucett was being extradited to Baton Rouge
Ray does a line of coke, keeps chopping
Watches the
Grace is bagging emeralds
Jake and Doug count cash
Bud keeps the  in sight
Quick glances
Mind racing
: The procession moves past a row of pay phones
At one phone, a discreet figure,  , turns
The victim's father, Gary Plauche, stood waiting at the terminal
As Doucett walked by, Plauche turned, raised a handgun
and fired
Bud's vision is suddenly obscured when Grace steps forward with the emeralds in a satchel
Here you go
Fifteen three-karat blues
Wholesale
Twenty large
Sudden  and  on the
Everyone turns
: Jeffrey Doucett lies dead as  wrestle Gary Plauche to the ground amid chaos
Lieutenant Carter was unavailable for comment
' , intense, watching the footage
As Bud stuffs the satchel in his coat,   what Ray sees
: Bud,     , arresting Plauche
, slow burn realization as he looks from the tv to Bud
And again
,
Motherfucker, he's a cop
Bud yanks a
45
And everything happens at once
and Jake  again
Wood splinters as Bud  back
Jake is  in the throat
in the forehead - he against the window, cracking it
'  - Among surveillance equipment, sits Bud's crew:  , and
Gunshots
Fuck
Go
Go
Marandino, behind the wheel,  his foot on the gas
'  - across Bud's back; he  off the table
On his knees, Doug is firing a

Bud  a burst through Doug's chest, dropping him
beside Bud's head -- Grace  a
45 -- as Ray  and runs out the door
,  - Marandino winds through gears, as Ray hits the yard running
: Marandino swings the wheel hard, -- launching him through trash bins, into the mud
Cobb jumps from the van and pounds Ray into handcuffs
Simultaneously, Shepard sprints for the trailer door
'   - Grace explodes from the back door, bolting across the yard
/
'  - Bud scrambles on the floor of the demolished trailer
45 held tight, he runs out after Grace
the chase rages
as he jumps a link fence, lands and trips into a roll of chicken wire
His sleeve catches, rips as he pulls free
at a searing pace
He slips in the mud
Staggers up Grace disappear in the shadows
Grace throws himself against the side of a power unit
Eyes darting
Wheezing hard
Tries to slow his breath
Then turns the corner
' :   swings from around the corner,
The blow sends Grace sailing back
He  on the ground, with a blood-covered broken face
As he tries to get up
Bud's gun is there
And like that, it stops
'  - At a table, the  : Bud, Shepard, Marandino, Cobb are drinking
bartender () is wiping down glasses
Think  broke a knuckle on that guy's tooth
He only had one tooth
Well  got it, didn't
(to the bartender) Another round, Sherry
Comin' up
Bud blows smoke, distant from the others
Bud, we all supposed to be celebratin'
'Been workin' this case for months
And you ain't said shit
They had a lot of weight
Too much
It's a ring
Organized burglary
You saw them guys
You think that half ass crew was organized
(laughs) They shit their pants in unison
What are you gettin' after, Bud
You think it was someone else's score
Sherry arrives with shots of whiskey, moves on
think its a part of somethin' bigger
Bud takes his shot
Tomorrow morning we put our friends under the lamp
If they know this "someone else", we'll know him too
-  - dark, stone monolith off the 110 highway
,      - Bud smokes, standing with Shepard in semi-darkness
They're looking through a two-way mirror into an  , where Cobb interviews Ray Wheeler
told you
keep tellin' you don't know nothin'
That's it
That's not it
We've been here all morning
We'll stay here all night
Bud paces to a neighboring   where Marandino is questioning Grace (bruised face, swollen, broken nose)
The stones you were fencin' belonged to an Amsec wall safe in "Kay's Jewelers"
The rest from a vault in Bocage
Both owners can verify their belongings, and have
(beat) Who you fencin' for
Man,  ain't sayin' fuckin' shit
Then your name's on a dozen other jobs, just like it
That's bullshit
No, that's a promise
Bud, sipping coffee, paces back to Ray's interview
We got a series of burglaries in the area
All over the last six months
All still open
You don't talk, it's on you
Well  ain't got nothin' to do with that
Any idea who does
No
Okay
Fuck no
Bud sets down his coffee, calm
' Marandino sits across from Grace, clearly frustrated
Answer the question
(exploding) ' ' The door blasts open
Bud charges in, throws Grace against the wall, then slams his face onto the table, pushing down
Try this
know you're too fuckin' dumb to be any more than a courier
know you're coverin' for someone else ain't a rat
'
Bud twists his broken nose
Grace
Easy, Bud
Go easy
(to Marandino) Marandino puts a hand on Bud's shoulder; Bud shoves him off
Marandino locks it
Bud turns Grace's nose even harder, nearly rips it off his face
'll teach you what commitment is
'll throw you in an eight by nine and have you fucked in the ass by every inmate in the state of Louisiana--  ' Grace, spitting blood now
Choking
Bud twists
Bone cracks
(hacking) He's from Whiskey Bay--

An unmarked chevy is staked down the block from a tract home
Jesse Wheeler
Thirty-one

Shepard at the wheel
Coffee cups and junk food litter the dash
Two tours in 'Nam
'69 and '71
He's a jump marine
Weapons trained, explosives

His stay at Marion, they kept him in "" block
block
That's home to forty top murder one inmates
Yeah, life sentences
Jesse only had twelve years
Bud likes it
He ain't just woodwork
: Night passes and the dawn arrives
'  - Front door opens and the shadowy figure of  , whose face we cannot see, emerges
(waking Bud) Target's out
Jesse fires up his '74 battered green -
He backs from the driveway and proceeds down the street
(into radio) Alright
Give him room
Bud's car starts and we move off with them
(into radio) We're mobile
- In the rain, Bud and Shepard tail Jesse from a distance
They pass an alley where a waiting  falls in behind the Chevy; Marandino and Cobb are inside
-  -   : We see the truck slowing, angling into a
He's turnin' off
Let's take him in the car
(into radio) Wait'll he's stopped
Watch your backgrounds
'   - Jesse stops at a pump
Suddenly, Bud appears at the window and jams a  against Jesse's head
Don't move
You motherfuck, 'll blow your head clean off
Reflecting in the side-view: Bud's  swings from his neck
Jesse's eyes resign to relief
Bud  this
Shut the car off slowly
With several law enforcement shotguns now leveled at him from all directions, Jesse turns off his engine
: '  - Bud, Shepard, Cobb and Marandino, vests and shotguns, move in unison around the house
Bud and Cobb stay to the shadows, down a side yard
Shepard, Marandino reach the front door
Locked

No one in the windows
Shepard signals to Marandino

(more dishes) Lynn suddenly gasps agitatedly, sinks to the floor soaks through her dress
Help
My baby

Bud and Cobb enter from a back door, hurry towards Lynn
Bud lowers Lynn to the floor
(to Cobb) - door slams open to reveal
Draped across the far wall
Windows taped over
Walls painted black
Military surplus on every shelf and surface
Helmets
Uniforms
Body armor
Bayonets
Bud in the doorway
Shepard joins him
Toss everything
: Several (now on scene) ransack the house
Ripping open cabinets, drawers, tossing everything to the floor
Cobb flips a switch
lamp illuminates a workbench
Alright,  want everything seized
Cabinets, lockers and tool boxes slam open
Cops stop cold, blown away by what they see:
Everywhere
#1 feels behind a couch
He finds a
38, then a
25 below a chair cushion
#2 removes the toilet's basin cover
With a pen, he removes a dripping
357
Several   lead Jesse in, cuff him to a table
Floor peels back
Flashlights illuminate:
and
Motherfucker's got a general store
Cops talk excitedly over one another
Shepard leans over a mounted
He finds a string and very slowly pulls up a ziploc bag filled with
God damn
there's some weight
Bud takes a seat at the table
For the first time, we get a good look at Jesse Wheeler: Cold eyes
Handlebar mustache
Covered in tats
With a boilermaker's build, he looks what he is
'm Detective Lieutenant Bud Carter, of the East Baton Rouge Parish Precinct
(smiles) So how you like Baton Rouge
Jesse's stare drifts to Bud
It's deadly
Cabinets slam open and closed
Dishes hit the floor
What happened to my wife
Water broke
She's en route to the hospital
#3 is searching the refrigerator
Jesse watches as if he's seen something we haven't
Cop #3 moves on
Jesse sees Bud's eyes
They connect with his own
Bud opens the fridge
He scans condiments then stops
From inside a bag of   , several sealed
This is new
Bud examines a vial's label: "
" What's the cyanide for, Jesse
Extracting impurities
Bud, right with him, grins
Impurities from what
Jesse, calm
Deadpan
You're in a bad situation here, pal
'll make bond
Bud looks in Jesse's eyes and believes it
Shepard, searching the room
Drawers, cabinets
Then leans down to peer under the bed
stops, stunned when he : a row of live Goex charges in packing, boldly marked: (top of his lungs) ' ,      - (40s), Captain of Detectives, enters his office
Bud tows, carrying files
What more do you want
You got a two time felon on multiple counts
You got robbery, &, you got an all-you-can-eat felony fuckin' possession
All on top of an organized burglary ring
: ,      - Mug shots of Jesse's front and profile
The man's in custody, Bud
Fucked for life
It's finished
Jesse's inked fingers are rolled onto an exemplar sheet
' ,      - There's more,  know it
Bud slaps a file on Braddock's desk, to a crime scene photo: An Asian  sits dead in the front seat of his car
Remember him
Ten months ago, a judge gets popped with a
357
Well  got a Ruger from Wheeler's toilet and rushed it through ballistics
And
It's a solid match
Dead on
There's a dozen ways Wheeler could've got that burner
It don't prove a thing
(drops another file) stack of bonds taken from the home of a Baptist Minister
The crime photo:  black  and wife shot in bed
Murdered
He and his wife
Looked like a robbery gone to shit then;  want it opened back up
,      - nude Jesse steps before a  and gets a cursory exam
still got tests pending
More guns
More cases
This guy ain't crazy, Mike
He's a ticket to somethin' big
Somethin' happening now
' ,      - Meanwhile
So who's backin' him
don't know;  do know they'll post his bond
That's why  need a price they can't come up with overnight
Braddock listens
Bud keeps it on track
'm right about this, Mike
(leans close) When a guy's lookin' at two hundred years and he ain't upset
It's like when your wife is accusing you of fuckin' the neighbor, but she don't know you're fuckin' her sister too
You're pretty calm about it, right
Braddock smiles slightly
It's 'cause we hit the wrong nerve
The guns, the other shit, the time
He can have that conversation
And he is
And he ain't upset
He's makin' eye contact, 'cause we're fallin' short
(the bottom line) This guy knows things
He knows where bodies are
Braddock, thinks; Then-- 'll bounce it up to the
Bud grins,  his hand on the desk
,      - Two  escort Jesse
He's bound in chains, orange scrubs
End of the hall
waits, arms slung over the crossbars with a cigarette
Jesse is brought forth
Guard unlocks the cell
The Black Prisoner steps back, joining  : All black, looming in the darkness
Jesse steps in
Guards unlock his shackles
Chains hit the floor
Behind him, the bars slam home
,
: My name is Jesse Wheeler
'm now in charge of this cell
Any y'all don't like it, step your black ass forward, line up
Cued by Jesse's challenge, each of the prisoners slowly rise, vehemently approaching
: '  - And the phone
(answers) Yeah
() Bud
Charlie Bowers
Bud's house is sparsely furnished
Books on firearms and police work in stacks
As he reaches for a file
(into phone) Charlie
You had an inmate in '75, named Jesse Wheeler
: ,  ,  - , on an official phone
At Jesse's name, he's Charlie, you there
What's your interest in this guy, Bud
Well, we got him on weapons and burglary
But  got a feelin' there's more
Damn straight, a lot more
Race riots
Smuggling
Extorting a guard
had a few run-ins with him myself
What else
, '  - Bud lies in bed, wide awake
The   carries over
You could say this is where he peaked
- Coffee pours into a mug
Then a shot of Irish Whiskey
He's a white supremacist
The worst kind, if there is one
Bud, dressed now
The table is covered with various reports and photos from Jesse's file
'  guide us through
Came in on armed robbery and assault
Bud picks up a photo: Jesse's Angola mug shot, age 23
But word in the system said, he's a contract killer for the Aryan Brotherhood
Photos of Jesse's tattoos: - on the shoulder; around the biceps, '  covering his back
In here, the guy became an organizer
' ,  - Bud's face goes in and out of light and shadow
Controlling hits and movements inside the system
Prison to prison
State to state
,      - Bud is walking with , captain of the guards
Between the Aryan Brotherhood and Neo Nazis, he unified the front
Bud and Murphy descend steps to a grim
All them prison gangs in the world
Black Panthers, Mexican Mafia, forget it
The  is deadly as it gets
And Jesse Wheeler was their ring leader
The   fades out
Presently: So what the fuck happened
Processing ain't open till morning
We threw him in holding last night
'Fore we even turn around, it's like we're back in the fuckin' Alamo
He attack the guards
Guards are fine
But he took on three niggers like they stole from him
Murphy stops outside a solid steel door
'll tell you somethin', Bud
After it happened, our block was the quietest it'd ever been
Wish we had ten just like him
Open the door
- Bud enters
Murphy shuts the door and a series of locks
We're in a stone closet
No bed or sink
No light
Heard you refused a public defender
Jesse's bruised face moves through shadow
At the gas station
When you were arrested,  put a gun to your head
You expected someone else
You don't look like cops
And your house
Guns
Mass supply tells me, intent to sell
Cyanide in the fridge, explosives
tells me you're scared
Jesse's eyes emerge from the dark
Bud, looking right at him
know who you are
If you knew that much, you wouldn't be in here alone
Bud smiles and walks to the door
One more thing, pal
saw the judge this morning
(grins) There is no bond
on Jesse
Bud  on the door
Locks
The door opens and Bud steps calmly out to the hall
The door shuts with a , locking Jesse in
And the nail in the coffin resonates
: - Dim and desolate
,   - Grace buys a ticket, crosses the lobby to the men's room
' Grace at the sink
He pats running water on his damaged face and straightens the bandage
the stall door opens and a man emerges
Lean and fierce, like an electric charge
, 30
Grace  at the sight of Catfish, tightening his belt
Lets the water run
Grace
That you
Hey there, Catfish
Catfish steps close, reaches a hand to Grace's face
'The hell happened
Grace flinches
Catfish pauses, then  his hand
(smiles) Oh
Excuse me
Catfish steps to the sink
Begins washing his hands
So where you off to
Goin' to visit my mother
She's real sick
That's too bad
So you'll be gone a long time then
Yeah
Another  suddenly enters
Large and imposing, neck tattoos , 32
(swallows hard) Buzz
Catfish turns off the water What can  do y'all for
How come the Wheeler brothers, is locked up
And you ain't
Wheeler brothers is locked up
don't know nothin' about that
Catfish
It's harsh
Blood curdling
heard different
Well there ain't no "different" to hear, Catfish
'Cause  ain't talked to neither of 'em
But you did talk to someone
Buzz moves
Grace turns to look
In a blink, Catfish's gun comes up:
45 with a thick, barrel silencer
The mirror shatters
Grace's knees hit the floor
His head hits the sink,
As blood runs from one small hole
Catfish straightens up in the next mirror
Tucks his shirt
Grace's body sags to the floor
Catfish and Buzz walk out
- Two  #1 and #2 march Jesse down the tier
On his left,  in cells, ,  and
Jesse arrives at a cell
#1 (calls out) Open ninety-six
slide back
Jesse walks in
His - steps cautiously from the shadows
'
Pale and nervous
Jesse stands over him
The brothers' eyes connect
And there's a moment
: ,      - High stone walls topped with concertina wire
Looming guard towers
Thick  blankets the yard filled with
Jesse takes hold of a metal bar, lifts it from a bench press
He does two reps
The weights  down and Jesse sits up
This place is bad
Ray adds weight to the already excessive amount
He sweats as he talks nervously over Jesse's shoulder
There's eyes everywhere
Like  got a sign on my back, Jesse, they all think talked
Jesse scans numerous   watching the Wheeler brothers
Just the other day
some spic fish got hit with a weight
Ten other cons, they beat him and stabbed him till there weren't nothin' left
And the guards let it happen
Ray fastens the safety collars and Jesse leans back
His brains were on the wall, Jesse
Like somebody painted 'em
Jesse does another set
Weights  down
He slowly sits up
They come at you
Not yet
But it's in the mail
can feel it fuckin' coming
Ray shoots a look at a group of   across the yard
, their "leader," and
Jesse turns
Czapp looks at him
Eyes meet
Jesse leans back
The press shakes as Jesse does a last set
His red strained face as the bar lands with a
,      - , long line of prisoners are filing back through the gate
Ray, behind Jesse
Says low: Hey, Jesse
(silence) Sorry  put you back here
never meant-- (turns) "Sorry", Raymond
You ain't sorry
(pause) took you into my home
tried to clean you up
And you steal from me
You take my fuckin' diamonds
(dead to rights) 'Cause of you,  missed the birth of my son
Ray swallows hard
Nothing he can say
,      - numerous files of
Arrest sheets, paperwork and photos
Alright, let's work this
(beat) In prison, Wheeler is credited for the expansion of the Brotherhood
When Federal split up members, they had to reorganize
So they tattooed their blood types and serial numbers on one another
Recede and multiply
Exactly
Bud and Shepard with Cobb and Marandino around a table, used as a converted eating area
Put 'em in prison, they get stronger
Everywhere you send one, they recruit in numbers
Within five years, their numbers were over ten thousand
Wheeler directed all that, huh
Shepard is flipping through a worn, thick file
What do you got there, Shep'
Interpol wired us files on three known Aryan leaders in the state of Louisiana: Edgar Bingham
Harold Kay
And this man
Lucian Adams
He opens the file, revealing mugshots of  , 51
Dark eyes
Sharp, gun metal features
High priest of the Aryan National Party
His "ministry" of Christian Identity and Paramilitary Order has stood for over a decade
Check this out
Shepard pulls an old, faded surveillance photo: (Long shot) Lucian talking to a young Jesse outside a compound
Wheeler was just seventeen when he met Lucian at the Patriotic Congress
No shit
Today, Lucian's one hell of an entrepreneur
Owns surplus stores
Demolition
piping business
Got trucks runnin' all across the God damn country
Bud's been quiet; says now: Stay focused
Get back to Wheeler need an angle
For what
If Wheeler ever flipped, news would spread like wildfire
The 's gonna know about it
They'd gonna know about it nationally
(re: his coffee) Pass the sugar
Marandino does
That's if he was a surface informant don't want him to testify
want to keep him on the street
(to the group) Look, this guy's been in it a long time
He's up to his elbows; wants to shake his hands free
can feel it
Braddock ain't gonna go for this
'll handle that
Everyone looks to Bud
We got one chance here
'Cause if this falls short
Jesse Wheeler's worth more dead than alive
,      - sea of tables divided by race as far as the eye can see
Jesse and Ray, trays in hand, find an island of They quickly part to make room for Jesse to sit
Suddenly Czapp and Roach arrive with their trays and abruptly sit across from the Wheeler brothers
How you doin', Ray
(off Ray's look) We was just over there wonderin' why you ain't got the courtesy to introduce us to your kin
was gonna
(grins) 'm sure you was
Czapp locks on Jesse, who calmly eats, not looking up
Jesse Wheeler
Heard of you
Fuckin-, heard a lot
Name's Czapp
You can call me, "Bossman
" (beat) kept an eye on your brother the past few days for you
Ain't that right, Ray
(low) Yeah
My brother ain't none of your business
Ain't none of my business, "Bossman
" And everything in this fuckin' place is my business
Ray nervously glances down at several Aryans watching
(to Jesse) Listen to me, you sonofabitch
'm gonna make one God damn thing God damn clear
Your reputation is smoke
Whatever they say you is or once was,  don't give a flyin' fuck
'Cause it's my say-so now
And your fuckin' brother's up for grabs
Czapp looks away from Jesse and shouts down the table: 'all got that
Suddenly Jesse
headbutt  Czapp's nose and throws him back
Czapp's head hits linoleum, echoing with a
He lies still
Bloodied and unconscious

Jesse calmly resumes eating
Czapp's blood covers his face
pour in, led by Murphy
, arms behind their heads
All except Jesse, who continues to eat
Stand the fuck up
Hands behind your head
Jesse rises
Hands behind your head
Get on the fuckin' floor
Jesse puts his hands behind his head, but does not kneel
Restraints are slammed on Jesse's wrists
And we
,      - The door unlocks and drags open
Jesse turns, blinking painfully into the light
Sees an imposing
Phone call
Jesse is led in
Duty Guard hits an extension button on a desk phone and offers the receiver
Jesse doesn't move
It's a secure line
Duty Guard walks out
Alone now, Jesse picks up the line
(into phone) Yeah
low, whiskey voice is  over the line:
Been a long time
Jesse shuts his eyes
There's a moment before he opens them
Read about the arrest, Jesse
There's a lot of heat on this one
don't want my brother touched
(laughs faintly) ain't callin' about your brother
'm callin' about you
Jesse turns  to find the Duty Guard watching him from the hall
Lights a cigarette, stares
You should have come to me sooner, Jesse
None of this would have happened
'm askin' you, Lucian
My brother ain't a problem
Your brother's a fuck up
And Jesse's quiet
Dead quiet
And Jesse
We may know what you can do
But you know what we can do
Understand
Jesse hesitates, then Lucian hangs up
'  - Room strewn with piles of casework
Bud, agitated, paces
Braddock, behind a desk
You're reachin', Bud
The leverage ain't there
It's there
It's gotta cook a little longer, that's all
Jesse won't so much as blink at doin' life
The fuckin' guy didn't rise in the ranks 'cause he skirts under pressure
(beat) There's no deal to be had
'mon, Mike, you know what's goin' on
Ray Wheeler compromised Jesse
By that, he compromised the Brotherhood
Don't tell me there ain't no fuckin' leverage
Bud pours himself a cup of coffee
We need somethin' more
Well we ain't sleepin' till we find it
' ,      - Lynn, dark pouches under her eyes, goes through security check
in her arms
Wives, girlfriends and lawyers talk to prisoners
Lynn, dark pouches under her eyes, holding their son, across from Jesse
Life
You know how fuckin' long that is, Jesse
Lynn's hands are shaking
So what am  supposed to do
Wait
Run
(upset) Your friends are comin' by the house
Askin' questions, hangin' around
Waitin' for the God damn phone to ring
Jesse is silent
You said we were done with this
That they were out of our lives
The baby begins to
We have no money, Jesse
Which means we have no fucking food
Say something, would you
It's gonna be okay
'm afraid
'm afraid for my life
The baby  now
(quietly crying) For our baby
, for the first time, appearing powerless
As Lynn wipes tears, trembling in her seat, Jesse looks away from his son, and glances up
Behind a glass partition outlying the room, a  is watching them
Stark still
Fixing Jesse with a hard stare
,      - passes Lynn her belongings through chain link
She wipes her eyes, holding the baby
The back bay doors open
Bud enters
Sleepless, wrinkled clothes
Lynn Wheeler
We haven't been properly introduced

You have a ride home
We took the bus
Bud peels a few bills from a fold, puts it on the counter
Take a cab
Bud lays his card atop the bills, looks at Lynn
'You need anything
anything at all
Be sure to call me
They look at each other
She pulls her baby close
There's an unspoken moment
And Bud walks away
Lynn waits till Bud is out of view
Then takes the money
And the card

line the tier
Smoking cigarettes
Looking out
Jesse walks past, enters
where Ray sleeps in shadow on the bottom bunk
Jesse pulls a Polaroid from his pocket: His infant son
He gazes at the photo for a beat, then brings it to Ray
Ray
No response
Jesse nudges his brother's shoulder
Raymond, take a look
Jesse rolls him over
Ray is limp
filthy  imbedded his arm
Jaw slack
Eyes wide and vacant
'
Jesse lowers, pulling Ray to his arms
He shuts his eyes
Teeth clench
And as Jesse feels the bile rising, his massive frame begins to shake
Then we realize, he's crying
: ,      - Pouring rain
Ray's corpse is loaded onto an ambulance
'  - Jesse sits in shadow
Alone
And it's still
: Jesse sleeps
Hand under the pillow
When there's a sound
His eyes   to discover the silhouettes of  , rushing into his cell
swings out from Jesse's pillow, slams  #1 in the jaw with a
On his feet, Jesse whips the sock around and whacks  #2's head against the concrete wall
He slumps down unconscious
is rammed into Jesse's sternum
Another shot bangs his neck
The sock drops and a  clatters out
With a final burst of energy, Jesse turns,  and rushes #3
Man #3 slams into the cell bars
Lights out
The remaining three Men attack
series of blows rain down and Jesse sinks into their grip
:   ,  ""
More  pour in, led by Murphy
They yank Jesse from his cell and take him down the tier
Guards toss the cell in a thorough search
Mattress overturns
Shelves crash
move to their bars,  and  as Jesse is wrestled down the  to
Jesse thrashes violently as the Guards slam him through a door into
between cell blocks
The  of prisoners recedes as Jesse's dragged into darkness getting darker
, '
We're in a windowless room
And Bud pouring coffee for two
Want a cup of coffee
Jesse is handcuffed to the table
Guards are breathing hard
This how you do things
Yeah
When  want to talk to someone, without giving the impression he's cooperatin'
Jesse pauses, caught by Bud's tactics
The Guards file out and shut the door
Jesse's eyes are fierce and watching Bud's every movement as he hands him a coffee, then takes a seat
You got a problem
Yeah, what's that
To start with, you're lookin' at two hundred years
've done the time
'll do it again
know you can do it
But can your family
Jesse's face is tense
Unyielding
Your brother's dead, Jesse
As we're sittin' here now, he's on a slab at St
Gabriel's Morgue
The coroner's callin' it, "suicide"
You and  both know that's a load of shit
(beat) You do the time-- sure
And you never see your kid
'Cept in here
You can recruit him
Your wife
plans
everything
Gone
(beat) 'Less you talk
to me
Jesse silent, a dark internal pause
He meets Bud's eyes across the table; then
Do you hate
What
Jesse's sudden directness has caught Bud off-guard
Who do you hate the most
Blacks you throw in prison
dislike what they represent in the system
Not as a whole
And Jesse begins to consciously or unconsciously "preach
" And you believe that by overthrowin' Aryan nationalism and integratin' races
polluted creeds, with us
You believe you're solvin' somethin'
believe we survive by integrating safety
Understanding hate, and how to stop it
It ain't evil to fight it
It's evil to tolerate it
(leans in) Maybe you forget that, to justify what you do for a living
Are we still in prison, or we back at the compound, havin' mass
You don't get it
No, don't dictate to me what put you in here, or question my intentions with your overcooked revolution
(beat) 'Fact,  think you wanted out 'fore even got to you
That's why you distanced yourself
That's why you're out there crackin' safes
Lookin' to live a life that ain't
In who  am, there's pressure
work for you,  won't need a lawyer, 'll need a priest
My outside finance is gone
My wife and son, their heads wind up somewhere their bodies ain't
So tell me, why the fuck should  get involved with you
How about personal warranty
Warranty
Yeah, that's right
You've been a part of the problem so long, you've forgotten what the fuck that is
(boaring in) "Finance
" Your wife came here on a bus to see you
sent her home in a cab
Is that your outside fuckin' finance
Beat
Jesse, taken back
Let me give you a little insight, pal
As to what  know
And what you think you know
Bud flips open a file and shoves a series of grainy & in front of Jesse
This is today
Photo #1: Outside Jesse's House
distressed Lynn and the baby being led into a car by Catfish
Is that your house
That's your wife, right
Who's this guy
Photo #2: Tight-shot of Catfish
(off Jesse's look) Know where he's takin' them
Takin' your family
got a pretty good fuckin' idea
Photo #3: An anonymous duplex
Catfish escorting Lynn and the baby inside, past several surly Aryans looking on
Jesse finally averts his eyes
Look at your wife, Jesse
Look at her face
And your son
They look safe to you
(a moment) 'm all you've got
'm all your family's got
And the longer you're in here, they're up for grabs
The wheels turning
Burning
So either you let that happen
Or  get the judge to allow bond
This never sees trial
And you work for me
And that's where it hangs
Jesse Wheeler
Please rise
: ,   - Jesse rises, wearing a suit
, at the bench, presides over this arraignment hearing: You stand accused of forty counts of burglary, twenty nine counts of felony theft, possession of illegal firearms, possession or dealing in unregistered weapons, possession of a controlled substance, manufacture and possession of incendiary devices, and seventeen counts of receiving stolen goods
How do you plead
, 40s, sharp, confident, expensively dressed
Jesse's attorney, rising: Not guilty, Your Honor
Let's hear the arguments for bail
The   rises from his seat: Your honor, this man is an habitual felon as well as a flight risk
Our office has overwhelming evidence that Mr
Wheeler is not only guilty, but also a serious threat to the community
The State recommends that bail be denied
Your honor, my client deserves a reasonable bail
He has every intention of appearing and answering to all these false charges
In addition, he is the sole provider for his wife and newborn child, who would suffer undo hardship if this man were incarcerated
Judge Ponder: Bond is set at one million
Kiersey shakes Jesse's hand
Smiles: Congratulations
-- seated in back, watching the proceedings
: , '  - Lynn, asleep in bed
Jesse stands, holding his son, quietly comforting him
When Jesse turns,   a
45 tucked in his back
(answers) Yeah
; he listens, then: (into phone) Okay
, '  - Jesse steps through his fence into deep , to find a waiting idyll on a dirt road
- -  at the wheel
Jesse gets in as the headlights spin on and the car pulls away
- Dark
Eerie and desolate
The car arrives
Jesse steps out and disappears into the shadows of a towering crane
On the jetty, a nondescript  stands alone against the calm Mississippi
His back is to us
Jesse approaches, stands quietly beside him
' How's your family
We realize now
It's Bud
Let's get somethin' straight
ain't here 'cause 'm scared
done what did, 'cause certain people crossed the line
They didn't keep their word
Well my word counts
They stand together, facing the liquid horizon
want a body, Jesse
How many you want
Bud finally looks at Jesse
- swamp area used as a mud retrieval source for the levy
Amite River
Jesse slowly emerges
Then Bud and Metro, on all sides, - ,   and
of
The sounds of the swamp are terrifying
Herons and bobcats
Boots hitting water
The buzz of a million mosquitos
-- An  shoves off the mire
'The fuck is that
Cobb's light catches the tail whipping into the swamp
Yard dog
Relax
Where's this motherfucker taking us
Jesse suddenly
Bud and Metro stare
(directly to Bud) Dig here
Metro exchanges looks,
Bud nods "okay"
: ' Metro engulfed in fog
Picks and shovels rise and fall
Bud
We hit something
Bud excitedly descends the pit to scrape gravel from metal
Clear it off
Come on, find the edges
Jesse watches as a pair of   emerge
- The "cold room"
Bud and Braddock watch as two hose down the drums
The stench is horrible
How long they been down there
Jesse tells me six months
Six months
Bud, they're biodegraded by now
Fuckin' worm food
We'll get an
Remember, we got the guy who put 'em there
as Pathologists burn through the drums
Sparks fly
The lids
Swamp water floods out
And immersed within: two sore-covered,
The room recoils from the fumes
, '  - Lynn is putting dishes away
The baby nearby, sleeps quietly in a swing
Lynn gazes out the window
, ' Jesse is under the hood of his truck, fixing the engine
When a '71 Mustang, white-on-white, roars up the street
Jesse glances over as the car pulls alongside the driveway
It's , at the wheel
wolfish grin
'Bout time to get a new truck there, Jesse
Jesse tightens a nut with a torque wrench, says nothing
Good to see you out
free man now
What's goin' on, 'Fish
On a Sunday drive, that's all
The good Lord ridin' shotgun, through another glorious Louisiana mornin'
Jesse  his
45 atop the engine block, within reach
Say, Jesse
Lucian's askin' about you
Fact, a lot of people are
Jesse stays on the engine, never turns around
You tell him 'll come by
(no longer smiling) That's good
'll see you real soon then
As Catfish drives away
We  a series of photos being taken at high-speed
to  &
to a distant
Bud with a long lens camera, triggers snapshots
- Greasy spoon, soul food joint
Trucker and labor patrons
Bud walks in, perplexed to find Braddock sitting with (30), Deputy Chief of Staff for  Attorney General
Pressed suit
Young face
Out of his element
Hey, Mike
Bud, this is Special Agent, Martin Fitch
He's down from Washington
With the Attorney General
Martin
Just call me Martin
Fitch offers his hand, smiles
Bud shakes
Martin's gonna be soliciting Jesse's case for a Federal sponsor
How long you been with the Attorney General, Fitch
Just over a year
Bud looks at Braddock
want to assure you my education and experience is more than adequate to handle a case of this potential
Is that right
Fitch's smile drops as Bud stares him down
Why don't we get to the particulars
Right
Alright
(clears throat) To get Jesse a federal sponsor, we need something substantial
bait
In the Justice Department, we have this mission statement
We decide who the target is, what's the threat assessment, the cost value, over what time table it's gonna take place
Which target do we go after first
We don't want to miss a big target hitting a smaller target, you understand
No
Well, exposing bodies has limitations
Those people are dead
We can't retrieve their lives
Bud blinks
He means there might not be enough to back Jesse
Keep him on the street without protection, he winds up dead
What 'm saying is, we need fresh leads
He'll need to present something that separates him from those we're going to arrest
If Jesse can't offer something continuous
'm afraid we can't be of much help
Bud stares at Fitch
in her 50s approaches
Ready to order
(cuts in) Yes
'll take a garden salad
Roquefort on the side
You'll take what
(curt) It's a dressing
Well
we got ranch, thousand island and oil
Which one you want
Bud's chair  back as he stands, stares hard at Fitch: Lost my appetite
And walks out
- Bud stalks out to his car
Braddock follows, agitated
They say nothing till they reach the car
set this up
Me and Jesse
If the Feds want to help, that's fine
But not him
What do you mean, "me and Jesse
" He's not your partner, Bud
This case is beyond our capacity
It requires resources we don't have
Bud unlocks the car
They stand, talking across the roof
They ain't takin' us serious, Mike
They send us some kid with a year under his belt
He don't even know what state he's in
You want him in charge
You're God damn right  do
You're out on a limb on this already, Bud
It's my job to make sure you get back
This is bullshit
That may be
What it ain't, is open for discussion
Braddock walks away
Bud simmers a moment, gets in his car
- bare room; nothing to tell us where we are
Jesse's on a stool
He runs his fingers down his mustache, grits his teeth
'all wanna talk about crime
Well could tell y'all things
Names
Locations
What boat is movin' what drugs, which one is guns
Who's gonna get cut up and why
But what  got to know is, if 'n when  do this
If  wear your dog collar
'all gonna do what's right by me and keep my head from gettin' shot the fuck off
'Cause the truth is, you need me
You ain't got enough cops with enough sense or enough time, to clear them crimes that already been committed and will be
(pause) 'all need me
got the devil's address
: We're in a
Shades down
Full of : , , ,
Law enforcement everywhere
On the furniture, against the wall, sitting on the floor
Staring at Jesse in silence
Bud stands by the door with Braddock
And Fitch steps forward, laughs nervously
Okay, great
Thanks
Thank you, Jesse, for that
And thank you, everyone for attending
(tight) Uh, we all know why we're here
To solve a matter of custody-- #1 We'll protect you and your family, Jesse
(to the room) It's a federal matter, gentlemen
Those bodies were transported over state lines
An   #1 imposes: #1 Not so fast
Ammunition, grenades
This man's house was a factory, for Christ's sake
is taking this
Those murders were drug related
's got to do follow ups
He was printing counterfeit money
That's Secret Service
, Agents' voices step over one another
Fitch tries to take control
Jesse's been silent, until
There's a hit list
Fitch hears this
He turns, loudly to the room
Wait
Wait a minute, quiet
Everyone quiet
And  stops
Fitch moves to Jesse: what
hit list
There's much as twelve
Might be one or two less now,  ain't sure
Some could've already been gotten
(to Braddock) Now we're talkin'
#2 approaches Jesse
#2 Why these twelve, Jesse
Different reasons
It ain't so much why or what they done that matters
Pick any one of 'em off that list,  puts you on salary
Everyone is suddenly interested
Bud sees this
And you, sir, if  ain't mistaken
You're Mr
Nokes, right
Agents part, revealing  (50s), black, an emminent figurehead in a plush suit
Surprised to be pointed out
First
Attorney, John Nokes
That's right
Well, last time  seen it
you was number two on that list
It's quiet
Nokes thinks
Then  and approaches Jesse
Can you fill us in on the rest of those names, Jesse
Yes,  can
But there's something  gotta make clear 'fore that happens
What's that
've listened to you, Mr
Nokes
And 've listened to these suits here, on who's gonna take me in
(beat) will die, go to hell and take all y'all cocksuckers with me, if he-- (motions to Bud) --tells me to
(beat) want y'all to know that
Jesse is explosive under the low projection delivery and a falls over the room
(to Bud) How's that fly by you, Lieutenant
Bud simply nods
'll sponsor him
Jesse's welfare will come out of our budget
Anyone has pending cases or leads for Jesse, see me
'll loan him out
Jesse stares at Nokes
As the meeting settles back to a comfortable level
And, Jesse
'm a little pissed 'm number two on that list
Who the fuck is number one
The room erupts with
Everyone except Bud and Jesse
: - Jesse's truck moves over an old wooden bridge through sweeping fields that stretch to a vast, wooded area
,   - Jesse stops at a long drive protected by locked iron gates
surveillance camera zooms in
Jesse looks up
second camera pans on Jesse, staring
as crackling, electronic pixels    and
: - showing Jesse at the gates
sits in shadow, hits a button: We see the gates unlock and open
' pulls down the private road
Shafts of light mottle then burst,  an elegant Jesse parks -- walks up the porch, where Catfish is relaxing, shoulder holster, revolver
And Buzz, cleaning a pistol
Jesse
Jesse nods, eyes Catfish
'm here to see Lucian
Catfish grinds out his cigarette, gets to his feet
He's busy right now; You can come in and wait
'  - : as Louis  pours to the rim
From elsewhere in the room: This operation of your's has become big business
You need relationships now more than ever
belongs to  , 40s
He sits in a leather chair, facing Lucian Adams, who's face we cannot see
Seated next to Morris, is Daniel Kiersey
We've done business successfully before, Mr
Adams
But it's a larger scope now
'm here today because  want to represent you exclusively
You need someone lobbying at a state level, as well as in Washington
My organization can provide both
We've got contacts that you don't have and other people can't get
Now, 'm aware that you have multiple businesses
However you need one go-to guy, so that all your ventures stay coordinated and all transactions and contracts are realized
am that person, Mr
Adams
That's what  do
'  lifts the cognac out of frame, drinks
What's this going to cost us
As a retainer,  want an advance of three hundred-fifty thousand, along with ten percent of whatever economic benefit bring to this organization
Three-fifty
'mon, Dick
That's out of line
If you want a quality global economic plan, that's what you pay for-- We'll give you two, Mr
Morris
That's what it's worth
Morris goes suddenly silent, looks across at Lucian
The advance is a drop in the bucket
The real money is the percentage
It's in your interest to see it my way
Morris stares across the desk, several tense moments
Then: You've got a deal
,  '  - Morris emerges from the office
He glances at Jesse, then shrugs on his coat and leaves
Jesse looks back at the office doorway
Jesse in
' past Kiersey, behind a massive desk in this impeccable room, we finally
Jesse is not invited to sit
(to Kiersey) Give us a minute
Kiersey walks out and shuts the door
he crosses slowly to a credenza, selects a clean shirt
You have a son now, right
Yeah
As he removes the shirt he's wearing,  tattoos: on his back
,  , '
And around his stomach, a belt of   with the words, "
" Prison tats, dark and aged
What'd you name him
named him Ray
Lucian, no emotion, puts on a pressed dress shirt, fastens cuff-links
(over his shoulder) Heard the cops smacked you around inside
'Wasn't too bad
Lucian checks his hair
You've been a busy man, Jesse
More ways than one
Looks like you done just fine without me
Business rollin' through the door
And Lucian finally turns; looks at Jesse, eyes measuring
Last  saw you, you asked for time
Time to raise a family
Time to straighten things out
(pause) gave you that time
Then safe jobs start poppin' up
Lafayette
New Orleans
Clinton
Baton Rouge
All over
The boys, they think it's niggers, gone widespread on a hunt for pig's feet
But they all professional
Burn jobs
Hot-weld oxygen
Laid out, burned, laid back, perfect
(locked on Jesse) knew right then and there, only a white respectable burglar could've done this
Jesse smiles slightly
They know each other well
When Lucian's smile suddenly drops
There's a flash of controlled anger across his face; and   a curtain of tension fall heavily on the room
Jesse
With all the work you been doin': Diamonds
Emeralds
dozen safe jobs, behind my back
(predatory) Where's the tribute to the greater cause
Jesse he pulls from his pocket, a tiny pouch
Sets it on the desk
He pours the contents into Lucian's palm:  and Like  said,  just needed time
Lucian approaches the desk, opens the pouch:  and slow smile spreads across his face
Well, even prophets stumble once in a while
Lucian embraces Jesse
Tight
Then, softly in his ear: It's a shame about your brother
As they part, their eyes meet
Something passes between them

Jesse's truck approaches, drives through

Lines of blue lights, strobe like rivers, air traffic above
And Bud, leaning against a nearby car with Shepard and Cobb
Jesse helps Lynn and the baby from his truck
Together, they walk toward the plane
Bud, watching from a distance, nods to Lynn
Jesse and Lynn stare at each other
She's crying as he pulls her close, one arm around the baby
He says something to them we cannot hear
Then with the baby, Lynn boards her plane
An  shuts the door
The engine  to life, taking off
Jesse turns to shield his face

Lucian, Jesse and Kiersey sit around a table
There's a variety of matters to discuss today, gentlemen
Eddie Moran's trial starts next week
One of the jurors reached out
He's asking six thousand up front plus a job at four hundred a week
That guarantees a hung jury with a push for an acquittal
Three hundred
Give him a no-show at the trucking firm
(as he writes) Construction on the building Morris brought us, in south-east Florida, is complete
Every unit sold
We should see revenues of one point four million over our original projections
Lucian lights a cigar, smoke curls from his lips
Lastly, our "friends" from the Middle East
They put a final offer on the table
They'll fund our operation in Louisiana if we agree to act on their behalf
Political targets mostly, on the basis of our approval
(beat) advise we do a test case
Perhaps a sample of their resources
"Final offer
" Demands
(beat) Close the deal
We'll cook the cash for it
By the time they realize, we'll have our return

But our primary concern is that list

We know that, Fitch
He's workin' on it
If Jesse can just get a direct order
from Lucian to him, on a wire-- -- wire
He just went back to work, you want him to wear a fuckin' wire

Anything we get would be inadmissable

Intel came forth at the eleventh hour that Naseem Kazuri - an international arms dealer - would be present at this meet
was tasked to observe and report
That ain't what they did--
--No
Because your informant-- My informant, that's right
-- --Your informant and his psychopath crew greased half our political interests -- over a bag of fake cash
You weren't informed, so what
Well  better be informed
'Cause this ain't fallin' short
Now, any of y'all got a collaborative agenda in the works
want to see it
These other agencies, what time-lines they lookin' at
What deadlines and why
Above your pay-grade-- (overlapping) And is there a purposeful lack of communication between competing agencies, who are right now charting future mistakes, as we fuckin' speak
That's not your concern, Carter
Braddock suddenly arrives, steps into the room
We're not talkin' about me
Bud
(spins) What
You're over-involved here
And Bud's taken off stride
Braddock looks Bud right in the eyes, so there's no doubt
'll handle this
Bud, red with anger, walks out
Braddock watches him go
Fitch comes over, relieved
Thanks for coming down, Mike
He's been berating my agents for the last hour
Braddock pours a cup of coffee
We're trying to band-aid a situation here, and frankly, Carter's preference for thug tactics isn't helping
It'll all be in my report
(interrupts) "Isn't helping
" big mistake
Now Braddock turns on Fitch, zeroing in
"Isn't helping
" Let's not miss what happened here, Fitch
We work for the same cause doesn't mean we work for you
What are you gonna do now
Send Jesse back out
Earn his trust
Bud Carter delivered the biggest informant in the history of this state to your lap, and you and the people you work for are gonna let it go to shit
(beat) You can expect that will be in my report
: - warped in heat waves swing ingots into troughs
The seven story furnace is deafening
Lucian is met by Kiersey
They walk together through glassed in hallways to a closed office door
Lucian keys in,  a disheveled Morris seated in a chair with two large  Soldiers on either side
- Lucian shuts the door and sits before an ill at ease Morris
Look
had no previous knowledge of any business with Muslims
So if stealing me here in the middle of the night, is some kind of accusation-- 'm not accusing you, Mr
Morris
But do find it interesting that right about the time  employ you, my operation starts having problems
Yes, but-- That is interesting
isn't it
Morris swallows hard as Lucian stares intensely
want to know if this was an isolated incident
If the  impeding on my work is the result of a deeper threat
What are you suggesting
'm suggesting you contact your friends in Washington
With all due respect, Mr
Adams, that's not what  was retained for
Well now it is
That sort of information requires clearance  don't have
If  start sniffing around, people are going to ask questions
'm asking questions, Mr
Morris
And 'm getting impatient
Morris gets stone quiet
Lucian hands him a phone
You don't leave here till  get answers
And like that, this conversation is over
: +   - Off a deserted street
resides, far as the eye can see
And Jesse, in a  , drops a dime and dials
(clearly asleep) Hello
It's me
You okay
(off Jesse's silence) Honey, you alright
'm okay
Just need to hear your voice
How's little Ray
'll put him on
for a moment
then a quiet baby's voice
It's daddy on the phone, say hello
Emotion rises to Jesse's face
He holds it in, barely
: a lone  is parked in the shadows, fog rolling past
Jesse sees it, can't see who's inside it
Jesse
He hangs up
Jesse stands there, watching the car
He slowly makes his way toward the back of the store, where his truck is parked
Pulse pounding, he tries the door
it's locked
Eyeing the car, he unlocks his truck
'
Jesse spins
And out of the darkness -- steps Bud -- ready to pounce
Where the hell you been
(Jesse's look) Two days missin', you broke protocol
Three, and you're a flight risk
Agents'll hunt your ass down
(anger spiking, pacing) can't keep doin' this
can't fuckin' breathe
Even the shadows got eyes
This is the job
If  don't hear from you,  can't protect you
(in his face) Protect me
about got my head fuckin' shot off, 'cause your guys was "protecting" me
Those ain't my guys
don't give a fuck--  don't want your protection
want out
There is no "out
" Not for either of us
Not till it's done
(low, definitive) Get me that list
Jesse  -- a malevolence in his eyes that freezes Bud to the spot
Then, Jesse climbs in his truck and drives off
: ' ,      - Bud pacing; Braddock sits at his desk
'm losin' him, Mike
Just relax
We gotta let things settle, that's all
It ain't gonna settle, it's gonna blow can feel it
What do you want me to do
Push 'em back
Who
The Feds
All these suits, fuckin' outsiders
Everyone
Get me some room
Some time to reel this thing in
'll talk to Nokes
'See what  can do
,   - Morris (a nervous wreck, unshaven) sits across from Lucian
Kiersey at an adjacent table
There's an investigation underway, funded by the
Attorney
And you're the target
Morris opens his briefcase and hands over a pair of dossiers
They're receiving assistance from both the  and , who are stationed right here in Henderson
(pause) How long they been active
My sources tell me three months
Lucian puts on his reading glasses, opens a dossier
Three months
Lucian peruses surveillance photos: Images of  activity goes by in a blur
Lucian's eyes absorbing, rigid, unerring
(reading) This is
Attorney John Nokes, at the helm
He's been after us for years
Who they got for a mouthpiece
"mouthpiece"
Who's the rat in the woodpile
Who the fuck's giving 'em information
couldn't dig that deep
But it's someone close
(pause) suggest you gentlemen disband
Immediately
Kiersey, foraging through reports
Page after page
Each minutely detailed
Lucian
Yeah
The investigation's local point is a detective out of East Baton Rouge
(beat) His name's Bud Carter

'  - Jesse, alone in the dark, seated on the couch
There's a outside

' : as the door opens slow, /    : seated comfortably in a chair
Couldn't sleep
Jesse looks to the darkness
Dogwood trees
Thick growth
Got somethin' on your mind
(without looking at him) There's been an adjustment to the list, Jesse
Jesse's silent
We got this
heathen
whore of an Irishman
down in Baton Rouge
He's protected
Got a lot of guys around him
That's why it pays
That's why nobody wants the job
That's why we're here talkin'
Who is it
Lucian sets a photo on the table, face down with an address written on back
Jesse flips over the photo: It's Bud, in uniform
This cop
he's got a mouthpiece
somewhere
Ain't yet figured out who
In the meantime, shut him down
, a frozen moment
He forces out the words: It's done
With that, Lucian gets up and leaves, disappearing into darkness
: '  - Jesse climbs into his truck and pulls out to the street

Jesse racks a  , loads it with solid shot, then lays the gun on his lap

With his shotgun, scales the fence, as we-- : ,  '  - arrives, stops
No headlights, two hundred yards from the house

The motor ticks and ticks and

He stops

The fuck's takin' so long

Catfish, loading his gun, as-- , '  - Through a window,   Bud washing dishes
Then, slipping watching him
Pulse pounding, his mind on overdrive, trying to untangle identity and consequence
Then
He taps the window, and Bud looks up
: Bud opens it: Jesse
'The hell you doin' here
You been made, Bud
We gotta skin out
: '  - Catfish, anxious now, racking his gun again and again
Somethin's wrong
Relax, Catfish
You said two minutes
Fuck you, man
This don't feel right
Just give it a second
(to soldiers in back) few more seconds, right guys
Catfish, breathing hard, bent on bloodshed
Let's kill 'em both
Let's do it now, right now, let's go-- Catfish-- (erupts) '

(into phone) Hey
Meet me at the office in ten minutes
Cobb and Marandino too
(over phone) Why, what's up

Lucian's gone
There ain't nothin' left on this one

Feeling every bit of it

His cranium was smashed with a lead pipe
Then the plastic bag
He choked to death while it filled up with blood
Got
'Name's Richard Morris
He's a top dog lawyer-lobbyist out of Washington
Cobb proffers Morris' wallet
Bud sifts through cards -- Several businesses, out of state -- Then stops cold at one: "Daniel
Kiersey, Attorney at Law" Put a tap on that line
Braddock ain't gonna like it

Disturbed expression: Bud

Then: #1 (gestures) Thanks for waiting
Go ahead
Tom drives onward, glancing in the : at Laborer #1 watching them pull away, receding in the distance

Bud, the pit in his stomach widening, struggles to say: There is no family

The Labor Team abandons it, dumping gloves and outer clothing into plastic bags, :
The bags go in the back of a waiting
Catfish takes the wheel
The crew climbs in, drives away

His face begins to tremble
Eyes press shut
They fill with moisture as he looks away
Quiet
Struggling to hide his own emotion

Under harsh fluorescents

It's a madhouse outside

They approach the bartender
(to Metro #1) He's out of his mind
'Asked him to slow down; and he punched me in the face
Cobb and Marandino approach

You alright
'm alright
The bar ain't

Chairs broken, tables overturned
Music on the jukebox
And empty except Bud
three sheets to the wind, drunk
Pacing the ruins with his 9MM in hand

Huh
You want to fuck with me
Cobb and Marandino peer in the doorway to see Bud, shouting and threatening a vacant chair
Jesus Christ
Bud flips another table
Continues talking to the chair as if someone were in it
'Look at me when  talk to you
(aims his 9MM) You try and kill me
You like killin' women and kids
Bud holsters his gun and beats the shit out of the chair
Bud
Bud spins, glass-eyed and red-faced
His wavering vision can barely make out Cobb and Marandino approaching
Easy, Bud
Easy
We got you here, Bud
It's just us
Hear me
Bud stands his ground, tries to keep his balance
Let's go home
There's a long moment
Bud stares at his crew, gone
Then he's suddenly overwhelmed with emotion

Wheeler

This guy's crazy
- badly hung-over Bud sits with Braddock, Fitch and numerous agents around a conference table
walks the room, says to all: This is an atrocity, gentlemen
Incompetence at it's highest level gave you my name
My resources
My trust
Carte blanche
And now this handsome face of mine
can't step foot in Washington, for fear of being laughed off the Hill
Nokes circles behind Bud
Now, 'd love to point to Local on this
But truth is, they've carried their weight
We are federally fucked
(looks right at Fitch) Because Federal fucked up
Fitch wipes sweat, swallows hard
So
Best idea wins, gentlemen
Chain of command
Point of procedure

That's out the window, just like our informant

Jesse pulls scissors from a grooming kit and stands before a grimy mirror
He cuts off his hair
Then using clippers, shaves his scalp and mustache
Jesse yanks a tarp off a '75 beat-up Chrysler
Pops the trunk
Throws in the gym bag
Then drives away

Lights on inside
Dense  overlays

There's a
Long-Hair looks up
The screen door rattles
Long-Hair grabs an aluminum bat, slowly approaching
- Who's there
Sudden surprise as the screen   and a breaks the glass, opens it
- What the fuck
Long-Hair  for the door as     12- Long-Hair collapses with a shattered knee and muted scream
Jesse steps in, racking the gauge with one hand, takes aim on the helpless Long-Hair writhing on the floor
: - The front lights go out
terrible darkness
,   - door flies open
Jesse, eyes darting, pushes Long-Hair in
Bandaged hand clamped to the collar
Shotgun at the neck
They move down a dark hallway
throbs, growing Long-Hair, gash gushing, leg crunches with each step
They turn another hallway
Light spills from under a door, shadows behind it
Jesse edges Long-Hair forward, reaches the doorway, creeps through
The door swings wide on the room, : Buzz, on the bed, furiously fucking a dark-haired , over a bureau
As Long-Hair rounds the corner
Buzz looks up,  Jesse
Dives for a gun
Everything  at once
The   and Buzz goes down
Shocked
Choking
Blood juts from his side
He tries to get up
Can't

Jesse tosses clothes to the Hooker
Get out
The Hooker does

Buzz and Long-Hair back to back
Hands and feet tied
Blood spigoting
Jesse circles them with the shotgun
The boat rocks gently
We got some shit to discuss
Buzz, to Jesse, unintimidated: Ain't got nothin' to say to you, Wheeler
- (top of his lungs) need a doctor
need a fuckin' doctor
In one motion, Jesse racks the shotgun, thrusts the barrel to Long-Hair's chin
Buzz screams,  , chair collapses beneath him, a dead Long-Hair along the floor, still tied together
,
House call
Jesse  Buzz up
His chair rocks upright, into place
Where's Lucian
don't know
Jesse punctuates, shotgun butt against Buzz's head
Neck snaps
Teeth rattle
- Jesse strikes again, connects
Buzz goes down in a heap, eyes swollen purple slits
His skull gushing red

Jesse steps over Buzz, pins the shotgun to his jaw
Who killed my family
Ah shit, man
Jesse shifts his aim an inch, pulls the trigger Buzz , hysteria

Jesse puts down the shotgun
Pulls from his gym bag, two , one of which, he splashes over Buzz's face

Jesse pours the rest over Buzz and the lifeless Long-Hair

As Buzz pleads for his life, Jesse unloads the shotgun, dead aim
Instantly, a
Buzz and Long-Hair's corpses
Jesse empties the other can of gas, Jesse stands there, the heat reflects the intensity in his face

Bud and Cobb stand apart
We've had a tap on Kiersey's line forty eight hours now
It's clean
Whatever's he's up to, Bud, it ain't comin' through the front door
Bud starts leaving the scene
Suddenly  and two barge forward
Carter
We need to talk
Get out of my way, Fitch
(following Bud) This is my investigation
Jesse's cowboy bullshit is not how it's done
While your agents build their cases and set for court, he'll erase the debt owed to all of you
Overnight
So you're implying  should thank him
Bud shakes his head in disgust, keeps walking
Look, Carter, whether we like it or not, you and  have to work together on this
We entice Jesse back
'll get him full protection, if he agrees to testify
That'll never happen
Why the hell not
(turns) 'Cause it's over, Fitch
It's done
He has nothing
Why do you think he lit that fire
To plant a flag
To let us know he doesn't need our protection
Doesn't want it
He would've just left 'em for dead
For God sakes, listen to me
'm not taking the fall for this
The plan is-- No, the truth is, Fitch, you ain't got balls big enough to relate to this guy
If you had listened to me, we wouldn't be in this situation
Jesse wouldn't be in this situation
And you wouldn't be askin' stupid fuckin' questions
(walking away) 'll bring him in myself
Just keep your agents off my ass
Bud storms off

No answer
Bud pounds on the trunk
Kiersey

Again
You piece of shit, talk

Grabs his hands and bends

You either go down together, or you give him to me

They page from different numbers
Bud finds a  on Kiersey's slacks, yanks it off

Jesse grabs Catfish's rapidly swelling jaw and yanks hard
Where's Lucian
Jesse  his grip
Vice-like
Blood fills Catfish's mouth
He gurgles, then  in Jesse's face
and two more teeth rip out at the root
Catfish  then passes out
Jesse slaps him awake
Where's he hidin' out
Catfish, last ounce of spite, cracks a blackened grin: Get fucked
Bone deep
Gum line splays open
Teeth crack and split
Catfish
Blacks out
Jesse stops
brief reprieve
He gets up and looks around the apartment
: Magazines
few revolvers
Empty liquor bottles
Meth on the counter
And on the stove: Beside a pie tin, speed base boiling
Jesse stares
He lowers the syringe into the tin, plunger up, drawing fluid
then very deliberately sticks Catfish's arm with the tip of the needle, pops a cc
Catfish bolts awake,
long, wet
Where's Lucian
Catfish's head lulls
Jesse grabs him by the hair
Leans in
Where's Lucian

New Orleans
Where in New Orleans
New Orleans
Jesse looks Catfish dead in the eyes
And death is there
Begging

With that, Jesse pushes the plunger down

Lungs convulse and spasm
Eye go wide then roll back
