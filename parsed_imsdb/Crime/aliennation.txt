'Bannon Rewrite by James Cameron October 1987 : -  ( ) of a far distant metallic object hovering just above the ground -- maybe two or three miles away
The heat waves and the light refraction off the desert- scape make the object undulate rhythmically, keeping its true shape and appearance indistinct
The   recording this scene zooms back, then pans over -- revealing a semicircle of  Army vehicles and personnel
Army Engineers with their tripod-mounted scopes and binoculars are shoulder to shoulder with the armed infantry
Everyone stares off at the same point on the horizon
Waiting
The   movements are , unsteady, as it moves through the line of Army personnel to reveal a second, less organized semicircle of observers fifty yards behind the Army
from nearby towns perch in truck beds and on car roofs, Budweiser and Fritos at hand, eyes glued to the distant object
The   image climbs up onto the roof of a parked local  van, finds the object again in the distance, zooms in, and waits, like everyone else
Abruptly the   contracts, becoming a box behind  reporter
That was the scene in California's Mojave Desert three years ago today -- the historic first view of the Newcomer ship upon its dramatic arrival
As with the assassination of John Kennedy, who among us does not remember exactly where he was that October nineteenth morning, when news first broke: that people have landed
from another star
We   from a large television set to reveal
-   - The Hollowpoint Lounge -- a cop bar
The off-duty uniformed and plainclothes cops are mostly ignoring the , except for two detectives,  and , who are waiting for the ball scores
remember where  was -- pissing off my balcony at the neighbor's dog
Others laugh
(yells at Crais on ) Get to the goddamn ball scores
, an on-location interview with a - comes up
Her name and title appear across the bottom of the screen
- From the time mankind first gazed up at the stars there had been speculation about a visit by people from "out there
"  How ironic that when that first contact was made, the two hundred and sixty thousand occupants aboard the craft were as surprised as we were about their arrival
That they awakened from frozen hibernation to find their malfunctioning autopilot had landed them here by mistake
The  reporter, Duncan Crais, appears again
These "Newcomers," we soon learned, were a genetically-engineered race, adapted for hard labor in almost any environmental condition
In effect, their ship was a slave ship
washed ashore on Earth with no way to get back to where they came from
dishwasher tray filled with beer glasses , and we    as it is slammed down on the countertop
Now an interview with a   standing outside a supermarket comes on the
When the Newcomers were first let out of the ship, they were quarantined in a camp not ten miles from the town here
You can imagine how the people around here felt about that
But once they were releases from the camp and we got a chance to know them, we saw what nice, quiet people they really are
revealing a    in a filthy white busboy's uniform
His back is to us as he picks up two trays from the counter
The bartender is dwarfed by this Newcomer, but works around him without apparent concern
Fedorchuk addresses the alien busboy
Hey, Henry, how you doin' tonight
Workin' hard
The Newcomer turns -- his face is humanoid, but disturbingly alien
You got your green card, buddy
You didn't leave home without it
The cops at the bar crack up
Henry looks at Fedorchuk -- his eyes carrying no malice
or pain
He merely blinks
: /
- -  - An explosion of color and movement as very quickly
We're  the streets in a n
d
sedan, getting   of the aliens living among us now: --  coffee shop where aliens eat at some window tables
--  Newcomer leaving a night school with an armload of books
--  city park where a number of alien families have gathered to play some arcane alien game
Jeez
they call that gang-bang a game
--  billboard for Pepsi featuring an alien
-- The sedan has pulled to a stop at a red light
Suddenly a hand thumps against the glass next to Sykes' head
and alien hand
Sykes jumps
It's a standing there, weaving, mumbling in his own language
In one filthy hand holds a quart carton of milk
We know immediately what he wants
Sykes rolls down the window
Take a hike
Sykes gets a whiff of the derelict's breath as the light changes and the sedan pulls away, leaving him in the street
Sykes grimaces at the smell
Why's it have to be sour milk that these guys get wasted on
What the hell's wrong with Jack Daniels, or Thunderbird for chrissakes
(beat; disgusted) Slagtown
Shit
-- Aliens hanging around outside their homes
-- Alien hookers plying their trade
Hope their plumbing's the same
It is
(and Sykes gives him a look) --  Newcomer lowrider pulls up beside the slug-mobile
-- An alien couple exit a theater playing "Terminator "
-- An alien wig shop
, and we start to   into the slug-mobile and : (
) So you gonna go, or you not gonna go
- - The dashboard is littered with fast-food detritus and two coffees in styrofoam cups making fog circles on the windshield
hand picks up one of the coffees and we to a face, a forty-year-old cop face that's seen some wear and tear -- behind the wheel is
Beside him is his partner of nine years,
Tuggle expertly munches on a slice of pizza as he talks
How can  go
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church
Simple
(beat) Me and Carol are going
What
Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since
since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear
Remember
You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week
Goddammit, Tug --  want to see Kristin get married, okay
But-- But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing
Shit, if Kristin had to get married where  could afford it, we'd be holding the reception at Buddy's Burgers
Sykes stares out the window, wallowing in his pissed-off mood
Then he spots something that twinges his street-cop radar
Uh-oh
Check it out
Tuggle sees what Sykes sees: two in long coats moving down the sidewalk, entering a mom- and-pop mini-mart on the corner
One of them wears dark glasses and a red bandana (): the other has on a black vinyl raincoat
Does that look at all suspicious to you
Whatever gave you that idea
- Sykes continues up a quarter of a block, pulls to the curb among other parked cars
- Sykes is already pulling his gun
Tuggle quickly reaches for the radio in the glovebox
This is one-Henry-seven, we've got a possible two-eleven in progress at Porter's Mini-Mart, corner of Court and Alvarado
Requesting backup
Impulsive Sykes is already opening his door and climbing out
Let's do it, partner
Tuggle drops the radio mike and follows Sykes as the Radio Dispatcher confirms the call
- The two cops, guns in hand, move along the row of parked cars across the street from the mini-mart
Through the store window they see the old alien  behind the counter
His eyes go wide as Kipling whips back his coat and yanks out a short combat pump-shotgun and aims it right at him
The Raincoat alien pulls an identical gun and covers the door
Sykes and Tuggle react to the firepower inside
You got your vest
Of course
Right in the trunk of the car
Yeah, that's comforting
Mine, too
Through the store window the robbery continues in pantomime
Kipling gestures viciously with the shotgun, yelling orders in the alien language
The Proprietor is quickly filling a paper bag with cash from the register
The ' , a middle-aged alien woman, stands in the doorway from the back, frozen in fear
The Raincoat alien dances from foot to foot, antsy, wired
Sykes and Tuggle crouch at the car directly across the street from the store entrance
Watch the driver
'm going for a better angle on the door
got him
Don't get pinned
Tuggle leaves the cover provided by the car, runs cater- corner across the intersection
Through the store window Sykes sees Kipling grab the bag of cash, shove it in his coat pocket
Bills fall out, but he doesn't care
Then, without warning, Kipling whips up the twelve gauge and blows a hole in the Proprietor's chest
The Proprietor slams back against the shelves, slides to the floor
Kipling leans over the counter and another round into the Proprietor
(under his breath) Aw, shit
Tuggle is almost across the street when he hears the shots
The human  of the getaway car (parked at the curb a few doors down from the mini-mart) glances up, spots Tuggle
He leans on the , reaches for a machine pistol on the seat next to him
- - Kipling and Raincoat alien react to the horn honk
They spot Tuggle through the store window and open fire -- civilian car enters the intersection
The engine is hit by shotgun fire, and the car skids to a stop in the intersection, steam rising from the radiator
- Tuggle dives behind a lamp post
The Driver is out of the car now, brings up the machine pistol to fire at Tuggle
Sykes sees this and opens fire at the Driver
The Driver turns and fires at Sykes
Sykes ducks down, and the car he's hiding behind is sprayed with bullets
forty-foot moving van pulls down the street between Sykes and the Driver
Once the truck is past, Sykes is standing behind the bullet-riddled car, gun ready
He rapid-fires -- creaming the human Driver
Tuggle is pinned down behind the thin lamp post by the shotgun fire from Kipling and Raincoat alien
Get outta there
can't
Do you mind
'll cover you
Get outta there
Sykes rises and runs across the street toward the getaway car, firing toward the store as he goes
Kipling and Raincoat dodge behind cover
Tuggle seizes the opportunity, jumps from behind the lamp post and runs to the stalled civilian car
He slides across the hood and drops behind the car for cover
Tuggle slowly pokes his head up to peer through the car window
His gaze is met by the face of the   driver who is still inside the car
Can  get out now
Move it
Sykes doesn't have a clear firing line on the aliens in the store
As he considers his next move-- Tuggle fires at the two aliens
They return fire and he slides down to safety behind the car
Or so he thinks
Glass rains down on him as the car windows are cremated by the shotgun blasts
He flinches as another blast hits the car
He looks over
There's a big exit hole in the fender beside him
Another exit hole is , inches from his shoulder
Panicked, he scrambles along the side of the car -- and exit holes following him until he reaches the front of the car
He has nowhere left to go and-- -- a  comes through the car and catches him squarely in the chest throwing him back onto the street
Sykes' head jerks around -- in time to see his partner of nine years blown away
Kipling keeps firing in Tuggle's direction until his shotgun  empty
- - Kipling grabs Raincoat and throws him toward the back exit of the store
The shotgun falls from Raincoat's hands
The two of them run out the back
- Sykes runs to Tuggle's spread-eagled body
One glance is enough
Nobody ever looked deader
Aw shit, Tug, Jesus
Goddamn it
He stares, shocked and incredulous
He can't find a way to think or feel about this
Then we see him going crazy right before our eyes, the rage revving
He takes off toward the store as  are  rapidly approaching in background
- - Sykes moves through like a locomotive skidding on broken glass, bangs through the exit
- Sykes catches sight of the two aliens just as they round the corner at the far end of the alley
He takes off, quickly cranking up to full speed
- Sykes rounds the corner
Doesn't see them anymore
He slows
moves along this street with some caution
Lots of shadows, lots of hiding places
Sykes  a , looks up
just in time to see Raincoat on a high, huge billboard
He cuts loose with the shotgun
Sykes dives
Huge chunks of the crate he dives behind fly off into the night
Sykes, on his belly, scrambles deeper among the crates
Raincoat's shotgun  empty now
He drops it, swings down off the fire escape, runs off
Sykes is up again in a flash, pounding after him
- Sykes rounds this second corner, races down the street
The only route they could've taken is through a tunnel up ahead
Sykes approaches the tunnel, all senses wide open
- The murkiness of the tunnel engulfs him as he moves through the mouth
He tries to control his breathing so he can hear
The only  is his own shoes scuffing along the asphalt
Then he  -- another set of
Rapid footsteps, coming toward him,
He can't tell from which direction
He spins, just as a   lunges for him with an alien
It's the wired Raincoat alien
Sykes gets his gun up just in time and  -- once, twice, three times
Raincoat alien is knocked backwards to the wet asphalt by the blasts
Sykes approaches the body slowly
With an inhuman , the alien snaps forward, lunging at Sykes with outstretched arms
Sykes jumps back, startled, and twice more at the pale figure
Raincoat goes down and stays down
Sykes relaxes for the briefest moment
Then he it
a distinctive  , metal on metal
Sykes looks up and -- Kipling drops down on him from directly above
Sykes goes down in a heap
He's managed to hold onto the gun and as Kipling comes for him, he swings the gun hand around
Kipling sees it, lashes out, slamming the gun from Sykes' hand
Sykes tries to get to his feet, but the alien grabs him and flings him down the tunnel
is  approaching in background
Kipling moves in to deliver the coup de grace
As he draws near, Sykes  that distinctive again
'
Though his vision is , Sykes still gets a good look at an exotic silver bracelet on the alien's wrist
The strands of this bracelet are what make the
The alien rears back, and as he does, the approaching suddenly  louder as a backup patrol car swings onto the street heading this way
Kipling sees this and leaves Sykes, running off down the dark tunnel
dazed, struggling to rise
running approaching
Sykes turns, his eyes wild and unfocused
'
An --   looming over him
Sykes whips around in a roundhouse swing with all his weight on it, pistoning his fist straight into the alien face
The alien, caught by surprise and off balance, sprawls backward
Sykes is grabbed by a human uniformed cop, as he tries to swing again
Whoa, whoa
hold it
Take it easy
(to alien on the ground) You okay
Sykes stops struggling, and his eyes focus
He looks at the alien he just decked, sprawled on his ass ten feet away
The alien is a uniformed cop
his name is
am all right
He gets up
trickle of purple blood runs from his nose
better call in
He moves off
Jetson moves toward Sykes and the Raincoat alien's body
Sykes tenses, thinking Jetson might retaliate in some way
But Jetson simply steps past him to kneel beside the dead alien
He checks for a pulse on the underside of the dead alien's upper arm
Nothing
Sykes is holding his punching hand in obvious pain
He struggles to rise
Jetson gets an arm around him to help him up
Your hand will require attention
Sykes roughly jerks himself free of Jetson's grip
Get the hell away from me
don't need your goddamn help
He almost loses his balance and has to steady himself against the tunnel wall
Sykes leans there, the picture of impotent rage and frustration
Jetson looks at him, with that slight inquisitive expression aliens exhibit when trying to understand human nature
- - on Tuggle's body, as the body bag is zipped up over his face, and the litter is lifted into the back of the Coroner's wagon
to reveal Sykes, standing nearby, watching
The Wagon pulls out, and Sykes turns, moving past all the black-and-whites and forensics wagons, and  (two of them aliens) and , and  (some alien)
He moves into: - - The    is checking for prints, digging slugs out of the wall, photographing everything
Several mill around
Sykes moves aimlessly around the room like a stranger at a party
The Proprietor's Wife stands near the body in a strange rigid posture, a thin, mournful   coming from her lips
harried female uniformed cop is trying to get her away from the body, but can't get her to budge
, a ballistics guy, is tagging the pump-shotgun the Raincoat alien dropped here
, a mean-looking veteran uniform cop is with him
Looks like a standard combat pump- action
It is
So what punched holes clear through that car out there
Minkler pulls an evidence baggie from his work box
Inside are four unfired twelve gauge shells
Sabot slugs
These puppies are nasty
Two plastic sabots fall away in flight leaving a fifty-caliber slug going two thousand feet per second
Tug might as well've been hiding behind a rosebush
Minkler senses somebody has just stepped up beside him
He looks
It's Sykes
Pretty heavy artillery for knocking over a liquor store
new voice enters the conversation
(
) An identical round was used in the shooting of a Newcomer named Hubley, two days ago
Sykes turns -- surprised, and not especially pleased to see the voice is Jetson's
Yeah
So why the extra fire power
Perhaps because even the larger caliber handguns aren't always effective against my people
(mulls this, then) You saying there's some connection to this other homicide
Before Jetson can say, the female cop who was talking to the Proprietor's Wife steps up
Hey, give me a hand with this woman, will ya Jetson
We've got to get her to Division for her statement and she won't budge
(to Sykes) Excuse me
And he moves off with his partner
Sykes calls after him, but Jetson is already approaching the woman and doesn't turn
So, you think there's a connection, or what
Hey
: '   - The slug-mobile pulls up
drained Sykes moves up the walk to his front door
'  - Sykes enters his apartment, an untidy bachelor place decorated with negative taste
It's obviously the maid's decade off
By rote, he hits the rewind switch on the answering machine on his way into the kitchen
The tape rewinds
He opens the fridge
Not much here
Left-over take-out pizza carton
Left-over take-out Chinese food cartons
Left-over take-out burger wrappers
The answering machine message begins -- he glances over his shoulder as he  his daughter's
During the following, he reaches the fridge
Brings out a milk carton that's in his way, sets it on the counter
Reaches in again and this time brings out a bottle of Stoly
Then searches for a semi-clean glass
' (bouncy, bride-to-be happy) Hi, Daddy, it's me
'm over at Danny's parents' house
talking about Sunday
thought maybe you'd be home by now
Anyway, uh, nothing really
just wanted to call and say  love you
love you, Daddy
(she giggles) Uh-oh,  shouldn't'a done that
Knowing you, you'll probably pull this tape out of your machine and save it -- in that drawer where you keep every card  ever gave you, and all of my old baby teeth
gross
Anyway, Daddy, don't save this tape -- but  do love you, and 'll talk to you before Sunday
(beat) Oh, Tug and Carol came by and met Danny last week
(Sykes stiffens) Danny thought Tug was the greatest -- but, then, who doesn't
Anyway, love you, talk to you soon
'Bye
The machine  and
Sykes take the glass and the bottle of vodka, crosses back toward the living room, switching off the answering machine as he goes
Then he stops, turns back, takes the message tape out of the machine and tosses it into a drawer
: - Sykes enters, stirring a jumbo coffee
He's slept about four hours, and his face looks like he went a few with Hagler
He crosses straight to Fedorchuk's desk
So what've you got on Tuggle's killers
Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours
Me and Alterez are on it, okay
You don't have squat
You ever try to make a case in Slagtown
The list of Newcomer informants is about as long as the list of Mexican war heroes
Up yours
Nobody talks to nobody down there
Half of them don't speak English and the other half only when it suits them
It's gonna take some time
Yeah,  know it's gonna take time
Like until the Ice Capades opens in Hell, with you two on it
Across the room, the Captain's door  open and pounds out, his deep voice booming through the squad room
Nobody wanders off
got an announcement
Get your asses back in here
Two detectives on their way out, stop, and head back into the room
Everybody gathers around, curious, as Warner stands holding a sheet of paper
'll make this short
This is a directive from Chief Evaner, who is acting on orders from the Mayor, who is under mandate from the Federal Bureau of Newcomer Relations
As of nine o'clock this morning, one Newcomer uniform officer has been promoted to the rank of Detective, third grade
The detectives
some angrier ones grumble, "This is bullshit
", etc
And we've got him, gentleman
(more groans) Volunteers for duty with the new detective should see me in my office
otherwise  will choose a volunteer myself
That is all
He turns and heads back to his office in the wake of continued grumbling from the detectives
Sykes, standing to one side, absently watches Warner return to his glass- walled office
Waiting inside are a balding man and an alien in a grey suit
Sykes reacts
The alien in the suit is Jetson
The grumbling continues around him as Sykes considers something
Unbelievable bullshit
How long has this Slag been on the force
year, max -- right
don't know about the rest of you, but  sure as hell ain't gonna sit still for this
'm calling the union, pronto
Others grumble
"Yeah
"
Meanwhile, Sykes has decided something
He heads toward Warner's office
Fedorchuk sees this
Where the hell is he going
'  - Sykes  and enters
Yeah, Sykes
Captain
'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective
Warner is surprised
He never expected Sykes
All right
Detective Sergeant Sykes, this is Detective
Jetson
We have met
Warner looks up, clocking this
He looks at Sykes, starting to smell something fishy
The balding man, , rises to shake their hands
Victor Goldrup, Mayor's office
Congratulations, gentlemen
Warner is starting to suspect what Sykes is up to
(to Sykes) You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death
You know that
Leave that for Fedorchuk
(nodding) Departmental policy
(to Jetson) You
Yes, sir
Good
There's another case 'd like to take
homicide -- a Newcomer named Hubley
Jetson looks over at Sykes, knows he's up to something
Sykes avoids his look
Granger and Pitts are already on it
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload
and  would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community
Don't tell me what to think
He's got a point
That's the sort of thing we should be doing with this early advancement program
Long-suffering Warner looks up at Goldrup, then finally sighs with resignation
Sykes grins
: -    - The steel door  open and Sykes and Jetson exit
Next to Sykes' slept-in look, Jetson in his grey suit looks like a Jehovah's Witness canvasser
They move past all the black-and-whites pulling out on p
m
watch during: and we work my hours
'll do the driving, you do the paperwork
You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all
(after a moment) Sergeant
'd like to thank you for what you're doing
What's that
(then realizing) Look, Jetson
Get this straight in your head
We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together
We're just partners
And don't call me Sergeant
Call me Sykes
or Matt if you have to
am George
Sykes nods absently, and they walk on
four and a half steps to be exact
Then it hits Sykes
He seizes up cold
Wait a minute
George
George Jetson
Jetson nods
he's used to this
Sykes cracks up
(between laughs) Man, somebody really hung one on you
've heard some good ones for you guys
Humphrey Bogart, Harley Davidson
guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while, coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you
You weren't at the back of the line, were you, George
My true name is Ss'tangya 'ssorentsa'
Gesundheit
You don't mind if stick to George, do you
- They approach Sykes' ugly sedan, the slug-mobile
Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right
Whatta you care
That is exactly so
(completely deadpan) It is like your name
Sykes
'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that it sounds like "ss'ai k'ss", two words in my language which mean "excrement" and "cranium"
Sykes looks at him, perplexed
"Shit
head"
Jetson gets in and slams the door, leaving Sykes standing there, the smirk dropping from his face
: - - They're cruising along in downtown traffic
Sykes drives
Jetson is somewhat cramped in the passenger seat
Let's talk Hubley
(refers to a folder he holds) His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown
With two  Sabot slugs in the chest
(gently correcting him) Through the chest
Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts
(out the window) Nice signal, dickwad
Jetson is momentarily thrown by this outburst from Sykes
Then
He was employed at the Northwest Petroleum Refinery in Torrance
He was manager of the Methane Facility
He was also a principle partner in a real estate venture to develop low- cost housing for Newcomers
Sykes grimaces at the mention of "Newcomer housing"
Terrific
real pillar of the community
(beat) Was Hubley missing anything when they found him
Was he ripped off
(checks file) There was no wallet
but he was still wearing a watch and two rings
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but  don't think that's what they were there for think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George
The murder at the mini-mart is not our case
The Captain said-- Sykes looks over at Jetson, pissed
Look, you want to fit in here, right
You want to learn how to get along
Yes
Well, there's a thing about partners, about being somebody's partner
You do for each other
And other people's rules don't mean shit
It's the rules set up between the two of you, that's all that counts
Understand
(Jetson nods) Okay
Well, my friend and partner was shot last night and 'm after the shitbag that did it
As my partner, 'm asking you to respect me and help me find him
Jetson considers this several moments, then-- And as my partner,  ask you to respect me and my desire not to break with procedure
Sykes stares at him, exasperated
Without warning, he slams the car to a stop right in the middle of heavy traffic, puts it in "Park
" Jetson, who is already a little too close to the dashboard, bangs up against it
instantly go crazy behind them
What is wrong
(very calm) Nothing's wrong
just want to get something straight
You agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right
joins the  outside
Jetson is visibly unsettled by the chaos
Well
yes, quite possibly
Possibly
Good
Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that
possibly
by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other
Does that sound unreasonable to you
Yes
no, it is not unreasonable
Although -- Great
(a relieved sigh) Well, 'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you
And with that he puts the car in gear and pulls rapidly out
think we're really starting to click now, George -- hmmm
Jetson doesn't know what to think -- he just holds on
: -
- , a deputy Medical Examiner (human), is leading Sykes and Jetson along the hall
He reads on the fly from a case file in his hand
You know 've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning
Come on
You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours
- They enter briskly through a swinging door
They move among the tables (some occupied, some not) during: Yeah, right
Don't push your luck
Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car-- The human
Yeah
he was one Martin Helder
White male, twenty-seven
Let's see
wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction, a couple for sale of a controlled substance
Oh yeah, and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock
They have reached a table holding a covered body
Winter unceremoniously throws back the cover
There lies the pale naked body of the Raincoat alien
Have you identified this one
So far he's a John Doe
Or a Sam Slag, if you like
Jetson smiles slightly out of politeness
No
on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough
Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match
Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets
Jetson nonchalantly looks over the alien body while Winter and Sykes continue talking off to one side
(referring to Raincoat alien) You took this gut out, too, didn't you
Yeah
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his
well, what we loosely refer to as
hearts
Lucky nothing
had to empty my damn gun into him
That's the way these people are
You don't hit both pumps you just piss them off
During this, Jetson has turned the dead alien's hand over -- sees something that brings a frown of curiosity to his face
He leans closer, examining the palm carefully
Then he peels back the alien's upper lip
Jetson frowns anew, with concern this time
He looks around, spots a Newcomer lab assistant nearby --
Jetson motions him over
Jetson begins questioning him using the alien language
Sykes and Winter nearby, remain oblivious
Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one
(hands Sykes a polariod of dead alien's face) We're just about to start cutting in
You're welcome to stick around if you want
It's really fascinating stuff
Yeah, 'll bet
Sykes looks over, now noticing Jetson and Bentner in earnest conversation
He only catches snatches of the alien language
Bentner appears very unsettled by what Jetson is telling him
In response to Jetson's final statement, Bentner nods -- as if agreeing to do something Jetson has requested
Sykes goes over to Jetson
What's this
What's going on
Nothing
(really suspicious now) Nothing
(looking away) Shouldn't we examine their personal effects
Jetson moves off, leaving Sykes there wondering
: -   - Two large plastic packets are dumped of their contents onto a formica counter
Sykes looks through the dead alien's effects while Jetson goes through the human's
, the college girl working the property counter, sits nearby doing homework
Jetson holds up a little foil packet with a puzzled frown
What is this
(looks, then) rubber
condom
You know
Coney Island whitefish
(Jetson doesn't know what one is) Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies
(Jetson still doesn't get it; Sykes turns to Ortiz) You need this for anything
Nope, got my own
Anything you guys don't use gets stuffed away in storage
Sykes tears open the packet, unrolls the condom, dangles it before Jetson
Get the picture
(frowning) And that fits
Well
Yeah, it's rubber
It stretches
And still it fits
Sykes looks at Jetson's serious expression
He tosses the condom and packet back into the counter and continues searching
beat, then he can't stop himself -- he steals a glance at Jetson's crotch
Still searching, Sykes picks up one of the dead alien's well-worn heavy work boots
He grimaces
the sides and soles are painted with a viscous black substance
He very tentatively sniffs it
and is grateful that it's not what he thought it might be
What is this stuff
Sykes gets some on his hands, doesn't know where to wipe it
Jetson glances over
It is a resin
Sykes looks at him
surprised that he knows
(continuing) Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks
How the hell do you know that
large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us
My spouse's brother is one
So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery
(beat) 'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible
(beat) Okay, next step --  gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night
believe  should interview the widow alone
Why the hell--
(realizes it's because of his lack of "bedside manner") Great, fine
You talk to the wife
: /
- - The shattered windows have been covered with plywood
Through the open doorway we see Jetson talking to the Proprietor's Wife
She studies a photo Jetson shows her, nods her head, speaking rapidly in the alien language
: - Sykes drives along beside the mammoth, steaming network of buildings and pipes that make up the refinery
: - Through the loud and smoky refinery we see Sykes walking with the newly promoted Methane Section manager, ', in tie and shirtsleeves
The workmen around them are both human and Newcomer
' (yelling over the roar) Mr
Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager
The men liked him
'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes
Well, one of the men didn't like him so much
They stop and Sykes hands 'Neal the polariod photo of Raincoat alien
They have stopped near the heavy refrigeration-type door leading to the " "
Newcomer workers move in and out through the door during: ' (looking at photo) You think this is the guy who did it
We think he could'a been involved, yeah
You know him
' To be honest, it's hard to say hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me
(impatient) Who else can  ask around here
' (looking at photo again) Wait
You know who it looks like
Yeah
Anderson
Uh
James Anderson
He isn't in today
He took the afternoon off
think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off
'Neal reacts
Sykes notices the door to the Methane Section
That where Anderson worked
' Yes it is
(some alien workers come through the door) Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there
don't know how these fellas do it
Sykes watches two more alien workers pass back through the door
'Neal watches Sykes' expression for signs of suspicion
: -   ' We see Sykes hand 'Neal a card, then move off
'Neal watches him briefly, then crosses to some steps and starts up this way
We  with him as he enters a door here on the second level
: - 'Neal enters, moves to a telephone, begins to dial
Beyond is a glass wall overlooking the Methane Section
: - through the Methane Section
past the alien workers in lab whites
past all the arcane equipment and chemical procedures
ending in an of a small cylindrical dispenser as it fills slowly with a pale blue, viscous liquid
: /
- - '  - We're   the slug-mobile window as Sykes pulls up in front of Jetson's modest but immaculately maintained home on the outskirts of Slagtown
Jetson's , an attractive alien woman, stands watering the lawn with a garden hose
Jetson's son, age six, rides his bicycle along the walkway
Jetson, dressed in his suit for work, crouches near the walkway, playing with his son
Sykes pulls the car toward the curb, rolls his eyes
Jesus
Welcome back Ozzie and Harriet
He  the horn
Jetson looks up, then moves to his wife and kisses her goodbye
Moves to his son, kisses him on the top of his head
Sykes watches all this
and as he does, slowly his derisive expression softens
As corny as this tableau may be, there's something very appealing about the innocence of it
even to an unrepentant cynic like Sykes
Jetson starts to climb into the car, and we-- : -   - on an alien hand as it removes one of the drug dispensers from a tuxedo pocket
As the hand brings the dispenser toward the face, we immediately recognize the exotic silver bracelet worn by Kipling the night before
It makes that distinctive
We  with the hand to reveal Kipling's face
sans bandana and sunglasses now
He wears a black tuxedo
He lets a small dab of the blue gel curl from the dispenser onto his tongue
He swallows
and reacts as the rush from the drug hits him
The door to the men's room bangs open and a enters, obviously drunk
Kipling quickly pockets the dispenser, moves past the Politico to the exit
: - - Sykes drives, heading for the Biltmore Hotel
Mrs
Porter is not taking her husband's death well
(impatient) Did you learn anything
week ago two men came to see her husband
After they left, he was very frightened
She identified one of the men from a photo  showed her
It was Hubley
Aw-right
What about the other guy
She didn't know him
But she said her son might
Did you talk to him
He has not been home since that day
But she told me where to find him
Sykes nods
: -   - The men are in tuxedos, the women in evening gowns
Only two of three Newcomers faces present
Kipling threads his way among the tables as the , at the speaker's platform, addresses the assembly
Our guest speaker tonight has done so much in his community and for his community in such a short period of time
And  must say, as the founder of the first Newcomer owned and operated corporation in Southern California, he certainly has come quite far in the last few years
Granted, not as far as he came in the years before reaching Los Angeles
There is laughter from the VIPs
Kipling slides into a seat at one of the front tables
He leans over and whispers something into the ear of the person seated to his right
We see this  , and don't see who he is whispering to yet
Whoever it is, nods
(continuing) As Mayor of this city, it gives me great pleasure to introduce someone who has so readily made our city his home
and all of us who live here, his friends
Ladies and gentlemen, William Harcourt
The VIPs applaud as the spotlight sweeps over to a front table
At first it hits Kipling, then it adjusts to capture  , seated to Kipling's right
Harcourt is an exemplar of the successful Newcomer entrepreneur
handsome, charming, with cool blue eyes that glint with his piercing intellect
He rises, smiling warmly, steps past his striking   seated to his right, to make his way to the podium
He shields his eyes somewhat from the bright spotlight
Once behind the podium, he slips his notes from a breast pocket as the applause ebbs
Thank you all for that very warm reception
(pauses, smiles) 'm particularly grateful because actually had the gall to write that in my notes: "Thank you all for that very warm reception"
Imagine how embarrassed  would've been if it hadn't have been such a warm reception
The VIPs laugh
He's won them over instantly with his charm and candor
: -  - Sykes, followed by a reluctant Jetson, bears down on Harcourt, who is exiting the hotel with his Date, and Kipling
We see Kipling recognize Sykes from their fight two nights before
but because Kipling looks so different, Sykes doesn't recognize him outright
Still, during this, Sykes senses something, though he's not sure what
William Harcourt
Yes
'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department
(nodding greeting) Sergeant
Detective
wasn't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet
am the first
Congratulations
This is my administrative assistant, Rudyard Kipling
(throw away) Rudyard Kipling
No shit
(to Harcourt) Listen, we just need a minute of your time
We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley
Yes,  heard about poor Warren
Tragic
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing
That's right
He and , along with seven or eight others
Listen, gentlemen,  will be happy to assist you in any way  can -- unfortunately, at the moment, 'm overdue at another function
Suddenly there's a voice from
: (
) William
Harcourt turns as the Mayor and his  step up
Mr
Mayor
William,  was wondering if you wouldn't rather ride with Luisa and me
Two limousines trying to make it across town in all this traffic, we're bound to be later than we already are
Excellent idea
Ray,  wonder if you know two of your police officers
Detective Jetson and Sykes
(shaking their hands, dismissively) pleasure
(to Harcourt) We really should be going
The wind is knocked from Sykes' sails by the presence of the Mayor with a very impatient expression
Harcourt smiles
(continuing) Please feel free to call my office Monday morning for an appointment
(to Jetson) Congratulations again on your promotion, Detective
Remember
you're out there setting an example in our community
'll be keeping an eye on you
Harcourt is smiling as he says this last, but his eyes are penetrating
telegraphing a subliminal warning
Harcourt and entourage move off
leaving Sykes steaming
: -    - Walking behind the others
They speak in very low voices; Harcourt continuing to nod and smile to other passing VIPs during: That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver
This is becoming a serious breach of security
He didn't recognize me
It is his new partner that 'm worried about
: -   - , the stocky retired cop behind the counter, hands Jetson a bag of reloads and some silhouette targets
Sykes nods to Jetson, motioning him toward the firing line
Go on ahead
'll be right in
(to Maffet, low) What'd you dig up for me
Maffet slides open a drawer, takes out a paper bag containing a massive pistol with an enormous bore
By his manner this deal is definitely not kosher
Sykes hefts the weapon
You said you wanted the biggest thing  could find
Well, this is it
What is it
Casull
454 Magnum
You're talking twice the impact energy of
44 Magnum hot loads
(flips open cylinder) Only holds five
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder
Hell, Matt, you don't need but one
(sighting) No
two
-   - Jetson, looking bizarre in his ear-protectors, is taking careful aim with his
38 as Sykes walks up
Jetson slips the protectors down
Well, let's see what you got, Cochise
Gimme six, rapid fire
Jetson, a little nervous at this command performance, turns, sets, and  at the silhouette target
It's a large, sloppy grouping
(continuing) How long you been shooting
That's pitiful
Whattya gonna do if somebody draws down on you, wave your scores on the written exam at 'em
Sykes starts loading the thumb-sized bullets into the Casull
Why did you do it
Why'd  do what
Agree to work with me
You don't like me
you don't like any of us
You have nothing but contempt for us
And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner
My partner is dead
Because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a rathole down in Slagtown, where he's home and dry, 'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody says nothing
Sykes grabs a bullet-proof vest from nearby, slaps it onto the hanging target form
He hits the switch, running the target down to the end of the lane
(continuing) But he didn't figure on you, George
You're going to get me through that wall of silence
You're going to make them talk to me
You're going to help me find that Slag son-of-a- bitch
Comprendo
And if Fedorchuk and the boys in the bullpen don't like it, screw them
and if the Captain doesn't like it, screw him
and if all the Slags down in Slagtown don't like it
well screw them too
Sykes raises the Casull, fires
-
The shell rockets clean through the bullet-proof vest on the target form
The recoil slams Sykes back, jerks his arm up
- again, and another hole is drilled through the vest
Other shooters look over
Sykes sets the gun down
sees his hand is bleeding
Jetson absorbs all this, as we-- : ""  - violet neon ""  , flashing hypnotically
It's a bar catering to rough-trade Newcomer clientele
Several  , brute laborer-types, lounge around out front
They glare with antagonism as Sykes and Jetson climb out of their car
(to Jetson) Okay, just stay back and do what do
Watch and learn, watch and learn
""  - Sykes and Jetson walk into the almost total blackness of this all-Newcomer place
few near-infrared indigo lamps dot the blackness
can't see dick in here
We can dimly make out booths along one wall, some tables, and the bar
There are maybe twenty figures seated or standing in the darkness
The room falls silent in a wave as Sykes' presence becomes noticed
Sykes saunters forward, commanding the space with his unhurried movements
(calling into the dark silence) Which one'a you Slags is Porter
(from the back of the bar) Who wants to know
Sykes squints into the darkness, then-- (aside to Jetson) Who said that
(tilts his head to indicate) At the end of the bar
Sykes nods, starts in that direction
My name is Sykes
'm-- Ss'ai k'ss
The whole place roars with
Too late Sykes remembers what his name sounds like to them
He continues down the bar and a figure in one of the booths sticks his leg out and trips Sykes with his size 16 work boot
Sykes stumbles, then recovers and pivots on the offender
Hoots and derisive
He sees only shadows
(merely a voice in the dark) Careful, ss'loka', you might hurt yourself
More laughter
Sykes gives the darkness where the offender sits a hard stare, then turns and shoulders his way to the end of the bar
Jetson follows
Sykes stops behind a big Newcomer in greasy work clothes
The punk Newcomer in the next seat is keeping his head down, trying to be inconspicuous
He glances over at the two cops
his expression shifting to recognition as he spots Jetson
Sykes speaks to the Big Newcomer's back
You Porter
The Big Newcomer continues to sip his mug of sour milk
Doesn't turn
Sykes grabs him by the shoulder and turns him around
The alien grabs Sykes' hand off, rising to his full height
He and Sykes lock eyes
Meanwhile
the punk Newcomer () has started to slip away unnoticed
Jetson spots him, reaches out with one arm, and grabs him by the jacket
No, Matthew
believe this is the one you want
He pulls Porter back into play
Now Jetson sees Porter's face
and he, too, reacts with recognition
Sykes gives Jetson a sour look, releases the Big Newcomer, and turns his malice on the punk Newcomer
Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it
Uh, Matthew
(over his shoulder to Jetson) Back off, George
But -- (know this man)
'll handle it
Jetson backs off, letting him handle it
(to Porter) Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already
Let's try again-- (slowly) Is your name Porter
Ss'kya'ta'
(to Jetson) What's that
Screw you
(back to Porter) Screw me
That can't be right
Ss'kya ta' ss'loka'
Ss'trokya' ss'lato na'
(to Sykes, low) You don't want to know
Tell me
Your mother mates out of season
(to Porter) That's very colorful
But see -- now 've got a problem
don't seem to be getting much cooperation from you, Porter
So  guess we're gonna have to take this little session down to my office, ya know
And instantly Sykes whips out this flashlight, snaps on the beam, and arcs it into the faces of the aliens around him
Jetson gets a blast of it, too
The aliens are momentarily blinded
Sykes has Porter pinned to the bar, the flashlight in his face, as he starts to handcuff him
But Porter gets a hand free and crushes the head of the flashlight
Darkness falls
along with Sykes' expression of satisfaction
Porter hurls Sykes back, slamming him into a table
The crowd  and
Sykes finds his way to his feet
Matthew, you don't have to-- (do this)
Stay back
'm okay
He charges Porter, brandishing the flashlight like a club
The two of them battle, then Sykes sees his opportunity and brings his knee up viciously into the alien's groin
Porter doubles over in feigned agony, then slowly rises again -- smiling
Don't they teach you anything about us in cop school, little ss'loka'
Porter grabs Sykes by the shirt front, is about to deliver a crushing blow, when another arm cuts into , locking with Porter's, blocking the punch
It is Jetson
Enough
(eyeing Jetson) Ss'tangya 'ssorentsa'
You're a cop
(with some contempt) It fits you
Jetson says something to him in the alien language
Porter gives him a hard stare, then moves toward the back exit
Sykes stumbles over to Jetson
You know that guy
(nods) From quarantine, when my people first arrived here
He and  were housed together
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him
In the camps, we were lodged four to a room
The selection process was entirely random
We did not get to stay with our friends
or families
And he moves toward the back exit
Sykes watches him go
: ""  - Porter leans against an alley wall
He speaks English learned on the streets
You don't know what your father and these two men were arguing about
told you --  was in the back of the store
just heard voices, muffled like
One of the two men was Hubley, right
What about the other one
Did you know him
Yeah
seen him around
High- roller dude named Strader
Joshua Strader
Runs a club on the west side
Encounters
Yeah,  heard of it
That's all  know
You want anything more, you ask somebody else
He pushes away from the wall, heads for the door to the bar
am sorry about your father
Porter throws him a look over his shoulder, then disappears through the door
Sykes and Jetson start down the alley
If  may make a suggestion
We have different weak spots than you do
Next time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect  think you were looking for
Yeah, sure
knew that
: - The wall-mounted menu is in English and the Alien Language
The  are teen aged humans and aliens
Sykes and Jetson stand at the counter awaiting their order
(serving them) Six forty-two
They both put money on the counter
The kid goes to put the order together
Sykes looks at the alien characters on the menu
don't think  could ever learn to read that shit
(beat) How long did it take you to learn English
Three months
(off Sykes' look) We learn quickly
We adapt
It is our strength
what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments
The Serving Kid puts their bags on the counter
(continuing) Thank you
They take the bags and walk off, digging the food out of the bags as they talk: My neighbor's kid has a Newcomer girl in his class
She's six years old and in seventh grade already
They climb into the car
- - Jetson doesn't respond
some things are better left unaddressed
Meanwhile, Sykes has unwrapped his food and recoils in disgust
Oh, God
think  got yours here
He holds up two strips of raw meat with patches of animal fur still on them
Jetson meanwhile is grimacing at the dripping cheeseburger he's just unwrapped
They quickly trade
(continuing) Which one is that
Raw what
(eating a strip) This is mole
It's good
'll bet
(winces, watching him chew) Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two
Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked
Jetson looks over at him, smiling
Oh, that's real attractive
You got fur in your teeth, George
Come on, man, we're gonna be talking to people
jeez
Sykes looks at his burger, his appetite gone, shoves it back into the sack and tosses it into the back seat
/
- - As Sykes pulls onto the street
So what was that other word for Human
Slow ka
Ss'loka'
It means literally "small but intelligent creature"
(Sykes looks over, doesn't know if he likes this) It loses much in the translation
And what was that one about my mother
That was a good one
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'
Yeah, that's it
Say it slow
Jetson pronounces the words and Sykes follows along haltingly
After several tries, he can say it passably well
- An upscale, mostly yuppie-human dance club
The antithesis of the "" bar
human  in a slit dress has just finished seating Sykes and Jetson at a table
She moves off
The two cops look up at the stage
revealing the exotic alien dancer named
She moves with a feline blend of strength and grace
Framing her face is a silvery nylon wig that she tosses like a mane as she undulates to the
Sykes watches with fascination
The  ends and Cassandra steps down from the stage, to be replaced by a human  as the next  cranks up
Sykes and Jetson quickly intercept her as she heads backstage
You are Cassandra
That's right
We are with the Police Department
This is Sergeant Sykes, and  am-- (laughing) Ss'ai k'ss
Perfect
We're looking for your boss -- Strader
She eyes the two of them warily, then moves backstage, assuming they will follow
- She moves along the narrow corridor
He's not here
Why ask me
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is
She did, did she
Well, she was wrong
Excuse me,  have to change
No problem
She moves through a door
Sykes follows closely so does Jetson
-   - Cassandra grabs some clothes and goes into a stall
Look, we're not here doing an interview for the school paper
This is a homicide investigation
and if you don't stop jerkin' us around, 'm ready to start playin' hardball
Jetson has waited politely half-in half-out of the room
Sykes rapidly motions to him to "go look around"
Jetson mimes back, "Huh
" (slipping out of her dance costume) Oooh
Hardball
That sounds interesting
Are you going to strike me
You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me
've got my own ropes
(still miming to Jetson) Does that cost extra or you throw them in
You've got me all wrong
don't charge money for something that myself find pleasurable
Finally Jetson gets what Sykes is trying to tell him
He says in the uncertain, stagy voice of a bad liar: am going out to the car
will meet you there
Sykes rolls his eyes as Jetson exits into the corridor
Cassandra emerges from the stall, wearing a long, stylish, low-cut dress
Look,  don't know where Mr
Strader might be
He comes and he goes
(starting to feel a little uncomfortable) The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson
Maybe he knows
(tensing slightly) Todd
Todd doesn't know either
She is very close to Sykes now
She fingers the lapel of his jacket
(continuing) know
Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you
It's Matt, right
Now tell me the truth, have you ever
made it
with one of us
Not unless  got real drunk and nobody told me about it later
virgin
find that very arousing
- drifts up from downstairs
Jetson moves along the corridor, scoping things out
He tries a door
Locked
Tries another one
Open
He eases it wider, then enters the darkened office
-   - Jetson moves into the office
Looks around
Makes his way to the cluttered desk top
Pushes things around
all the usual stuff
He starts to turn away, then his eye catches something sticking out from behind a row of ledger books
He reaches for it
small dispenser -- of the kind we saw being filled at the refinery
Jetson studies it, his suspicions growing
Opening it, he finds only the barest trace of a viscous substance
He smells it
not enough to tell for certain what it is
But enough that he is very concerned about what it could be
'   - Cassandra is practically melting herself into Sykes now
She takes his hand and guides his fingertips over her facial ridges
She shudders with pleasure
Sykes begins to perspire
There's lots of things  haven't done, but his ain't high on the list
Don't take it personally
think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out
little scared
and a lot curious
Maybe more than you want to admit
But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together
(coos) Think of it as broadening your horizons
like my horizons narrow
(pressing herself into him) Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes
He quickly disengages from her
My voice, body, and everything else is saying 'll be back in two hours for Strader, and he better damn well be here
He shoves a business card at her, then retreats through the door
- Sykes closes the door and lets out his breath
'   - Cassandra's expression instantly turns to worry and she quickly crosses to a phone and punches the intercom button
-   - Jetson, looking through a desk drawer, hears the intercom in the next room
Through the wall-- (
) (tentatively) Yes
(
) (over the intercom, breathless) Todd, it's me
The police were just here
looking for Strader
And asking about you
Jetson moves toward the door to the adjoining office, drawing his gun
The floor squeaks beneath his feet
He looks down, then continues toward the door
-   - Jetson eases open the door
It's the manager's private office
Jetson sees the phone receiver resting on the desk, the desk lamp on, a lit cigarette in an ashtray -- but no one behind the desk
Jetson eases through the door and-- -- a chair crashes down on him from behind the door
Jetson goes down, his gun skittering out of his hand
- Jetson and his assailant battle in the well-appointed office
-    - Sykes hears the fight through the private office door
He throws the door open
- Sykes stands in the doorway, the Casull straight-armed at Jetson's assailant
Freeze
Now
The assailant does
He looks at Sykes, scared, breathing hard
He's a Newcomer in a snappy Armani suit
This is Jetson, on the floor, starts to rise
Suddenly somebody flies at Sykes from the side, knocking him sideways down the corridor
It's Cassandra
Watson seizes the moment and shoves the off-balance Jetson into some furniture and dives for the door
- Watson runs down the corridor, ducking onto a fire escape
Meanwhile Sykes wrestles with Cassandra
She's as strong as he is, but he has the edge in experience
Jetson, disheveled, appears in the private office doorway, ready to chase Watson, but not knowing which way he went
(struggling with Cassandra) Fire escape
End of the hall
Jetson nods, takes off down the corridor
Sykes manges to get one handcuff on Cassandra's wrist, the other cuff around a pipe sticking out of the wall
She  at him in the alien language as he collects the Casull and charges down the corridor
-   - Jetson pounds down the fire escape
Below him, he sees Watson reach the ground and take off running for the parking area
Jetson reaches the ground and gives chase
- Watson zig-zags through the parked cars, Jetson cutting down other rows trying to make up the distance between them
-   - Sykes bangs down the fire escape, leaping the last fifteen feet to the ground
- Watson reaches his Alfa Romeo, yanks open the door, fires it up
Jetson slides up, ten feet behind the car, pulls his gun, aims
The white reverse-lights flash on
Jetson stands there, gun aimed -- but he hesitates to shoot
In that split second hesitation, Watson floors it
Jetson jumping to avoid being hit
- Watson throws the car into Drive, looks up, and sees Sykes standing right in front of the car
He hits the gas
Sykes has no choice then to leap onto the hood of the car
Watson, with Sykes' face on the other side of the glass, panics and-- - -- plows the Alfa into some parked cars
Sykes is up in a flash -- yanks Watson out of the car
Watson rears back to swing at Sykes, when Sykes swings his arms around in two wide arcs, his fists landing two direct hits in the nerve centers under Watson's arms
Watson folds over with a "ooowwph" sound and drops to his knees
(breathing hard) 'll be damned
It worked
(sees Jetson run up) How'd you like that, huh
Whammo
Both barrels
Dropped him like a bag of cement
Jetson picks up Watson's fallen wallet
He looks at the Who is he
Todd Watson
The assistant manager
Watson is still doubled over, just trying to draw one agonized breath
don't believe this
Look at my suit
Look at what you made me do to my car
(laughing) Your girlfriend put up a better fight than you did, pal
We are looking for your employer, Joshua Strader
He's out of town
Why did you run
Because you two were chasing me
We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch
When will Strader return
Who knows
He's the boss -- he doesn't have to check in with me
(wearily) Watson
this is my partner here's first coupla days, and he wants to make a good impression
Me, though, the way  feel -- this could be my last day, know what  mean
And 'm ready to rain on you like a cow pissin' on a flat rock
Look -- Mr
Strader hasn't been around for a coupla days
He didn't tell me where he was going or when he'd be back
swear it
(to Jetson) What do you think
believe he is probably lying
Through his ass
(to Watson) Next time you see him, tell him to call me
unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes
Sykes shoves a business card in Watson's breast pocket
They walk away and Watson slumps against his car
- as they walk wearily to the slug-mobile
George, you can handle the women from now on, you mind
: - Watson is alone, surveying the damage to his Alfa, when he hears footsteps
He turns with a "What now
" expression and -- a shotgun butt is slammed into his forehead
He goes down
Kipling stands over him, flanked by One of these is , senior human in Harcourt's employ
(to other Thugs) Okay, scrape him up
: _ Harcourt's private limo glides down the narrow access road, passing a lookout car attended by two alien Thugs
The limo moves down to the beach, parking near an n
d
van
Harcourt exits the limo, walks onto the sand to the back of the van
Here he finds Kipling and Quint and the three human Thugs
They have Watson chained to the van's rear bumper, facing the sea, and have been working him over with a tire iron
He's bruised and bloody, but still conscious
Any progress
My arm's gettin' tired and so far, zip
He is ss'verdlatya ss'alo to Strader
What's that mean
Duty-bonded
His allegiance to Strader is above pain or life
You tellin' me this guy would die before he'd screw his boss and work for us
Nobody's that dumb
It is something you couldn't comprehend, Quint
Harcourt approaches Watson, kneels beside him, careful to keep the knee of his designer pants out of the sand
understand you have been resisting my offer Mr
Watson
Your sense of duty to Mr
Strader is noble, but -- no longer an issue, 'm afraid
Harcourt signals and the two Thugs drag an alien body from the back if the van: a middle-aged alien, Strader, shot twice through the front of his silk suit
Watson's eyes widen in fear
(continuing) will not make this offer again want you to work for me, to manage the nightclub as Strader's successor
If you do, you will know a wealth and comfort our people never dared imagine
Watson stares at Harcourt, scared but defiant
Sss'k'a ta'
Harcourt studies Watson a moment, perhaps even admiring his resolve
Then-- It is such a pity to die for an outmoded value
(rising) Mr
Quint,  believe it's time for our friend's swimming lesson
Watson freaks out, howling and lashing against the chains
(to Watson) It's important to learn new skills
Essential to your growth as a person
Quint and the Thugs free Watson from the bumper
He bucks and lunges as they drag him toward the surf
Quint addresses one of the Thugs, a new guy
You never seen this before, have you, Billy
oh, man, you ain't gonna believe it
seawater is like battery acid to these guys don't know what it is, some kinds chemical reaction
Whatta you think it is, Watson
Whoa, hold him
(a wave breaks outside, the foam rolls in) What  love about the surf is you can never tell how far up it's going to come until it
whoops, got a little wet there
The wave just sloshes over Watson's lower legs
He screams
Flailing, one of his hands dips below the surface of the water
He howls and yanks out his hand
We see the alien hand dripping seawater
then a thousand droplets of purple alien blood begin to bead all over the hand
The Thugs get Watson swinging
Last call, sucker
One
two
Watson is flung into the surf
Harcourt and Kipling have walked down almost to the waterline
We  Watson's  and
then nothing
Kipling is very nervous this close to the water
Harcourt seems unperturbed
When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley
This is getting out of hand
want you to deal with it
Immediately
wave rushes up the sand
Kipling quickly steps back
Harcourt stands firm, staring it down, and the foam stops six inches from his dress shoes
(continuing) We must learn to embrace the things we fear
and from that grow strong
moment, then he turns and starts back toward the limo
He motions to Strader's body and the surf
The Thugs grab the body and heave it into the waves
: '  - Jetson is talking rapidly in the alien language on the kitchen wall phone
Sykes, foreground, takes the bottle of vodka from the refrigerator, throws some ice in a glass, pours himself a shot
As Jetson is talking, he spots the carton of milk that Sykes inadvertently left out of the refrigerator two nights ago
He sniffs it
his eyebrows do an involuntary movement
He finishes with his wife and hangs up
He watches Sykes take a long pull on the vodka
(holds up milk carton) Would you mind
Sykes shrugs, tosses him a glass
Jetson pours the semi- lumpy milk and takes a big swallow
Sykes grimaces
Then-- (indicates phone) So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she
My wife
She worries about me
Sykes leans against the counter, getting comfortable, his voice more weary then bitter
Yeah
know the routine
You are married
Was
Divorced
We mate for life
Divorce
is a strange concept to us
It's like having an eleventh finger removed
It hurts like hell, but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place
Jetson nods -- even though he doesn't really understand this
They drink
Jetson gazes around
Your home is quite disordered thought perhaps you had been burglarized when  walked in
(growling) appreciate your honesty, George
He smacks his glass against Jetson's
They drink
'  - Sykes has his wallet out
showing Jetson a dog-eared photo
Ignore the bitch on the left, that's Edie
call her Edi Amin
This is Kristin, my daughter
It's kinda an old picture
she's twenty now
Getting married, in fact
on Sunday
Jetson sitting across the table from Sykes, looks at the proffered photo
They're both a little drunk now
Human children can be very beautiful
(then) Getting married
Congratulations
You will be taking Sunday off, then
(uneasy) Maybe not
don't know
'm not sure 'm gonna go
(mumbles) She doesn't need her burn-out of a father there
Jetson looks at him
Sees something he never thought possible in Sykes
Vulnerability
Trying to break the melancholy mood, Jetson reaches for his wallet
(upbeat) must show you
(flips open wallet, shows four crisp photos of his wife) And this is Richard
My son
He's four years old
We named him after the former President, Richard Nixon
Sykes looks at all the photos sprawled out on the table
and has to laugh
He looks up at Jetson's sincere face
He may be starting to like this guy
You open to a piece of advice
Tell people you named him after Richard Burton, the actor
Just take my word for it
And he clacks his glass against Jetson's sitting on the table, and-- '  - They are quite a bit drunker
Jetson has doffed his jacket and tie, leans in, listening intently to Sykes
and so, and so the doctor says, "If this is the thermometer, then where'd  leave the pen
" (laughs raucously, Jetson doesn't react) You're not
you don't think that's funny
George, work with me, always get a laugh with that one
Look, if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand, then where's his pen gotta be
(straight-faced) In the other man's rectum
(laughing) Sticking out of his ass
yeah
See, that's what makes it a joke
There's like a surprise, and your mind fills in the funny picture
Here's this guy with a pen stuck in his ass and he thinks it's a thermometer
(Jetson just blinks) Nada, huh
Jetson shrugs apologetically
Sykes pours them each another round
(continuing) Your health
Ta ss'trakyona'
They  glasses, and-- '  - The party has moves into the living room floor, around the coffee table
It's a quieter moment
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other
No shit, Holmes
You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes
You humans are very curious to us
You invite us to live among you, in an atmosphere of equality we've never known before
You lay before us a beautiful green world, full of freedoms and opportunities
You give us ownership of our lives for the first time
and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves: to live by the rules
rules that aren't made to keep one people subordinate to another, but rules that exist to preserve equality
You aspire to very high ideals here
Sykes is watching Jetson, mesmerized
The guy's never said this much at one time before
If he wasn't drunk, Jetson would never let himself open up to a human like this
(continuing) hope you can understand how special your world is
how unique a people you humans are
So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves
Don't count on me, George
never had any ideals
Jetson smiles a little
He knows that's bullshit
We don't understand the hatred, the contempt
But we must bear it
we must not react in anger
because our situation here is still fragile
The separationists would see us returned to the quarantine camps
The fundamentalists say we have no more human rights than dogs or cats
But the prejudice we face here is so insignificant compared to the pain that we've known before
And that is why we are so grateful
Sykes studies him a long time through heavy-lidded eyes
Finally-- Yeah, well
except  did hear you eat your dead
Jetson looks at him a long beat, then-- (deadpan) Only on Fridays
Sykes stares at him for about five seconds and then explodes with laughter
You son-of-a-bitch
You're okay
Jetson stands unsteadily, and announces: 'm going home
Yeah, go home
Get some sleep
You do sleep, don't you
Jetson, going out the front door, just waves over his shoulder without turning around
He's gone
What a wildman
Sykes, stands there wobbling, then he collapses backward onto the sofa, unconscious
And we   -- '  - The first hues of dawn stream through the window
Sykes remains passed out on the sofa where we left him
-   '  - The slug-mobile parked at the curb
Silence, then the of a heavy truck
and a tow truck turns onto this street at the corner
The tow truck glides to the curb in front of the slug- mobile
The driver stays inside as his passenger alights carrying a tool kit and a paper bag
The human is Quint
Quint uses a slim-jim to open the slug-mobile door, then slides behind the wheel
- - Quint slides the contents from the paper bag
It is a packet of -4 plastic explosives, with a primer cap, and two lead wires with their ends bared
Quint bends down, starts to work under the dash
As his head disappears from , suddenly another head appears above the seats
George Jetson sitting up groggily in the back seat
blanket slips off his head and shoulders
He sits there blinking, rubbing his eyes, feeling lousy
Under the dash, Quint starts to whistle as he works
Mistake
Jetson, with a puzzled expression, leans forward and sees this guy in the front seat
Before he can jump-start his brain, Quint sits up, sees him, and hammers him in the face with his fist
Jetson is knocked back, holding his face
That was the last thing he needed
-   '  - Meanwhile Quint is shouting and bailing out of the car
He runs and leaps into the already moving tow truck
It is sliding around the corner out of sight just as Jetson stumbles out of the car
He whips out his gun from the unfamiliar shoulder rig and it flies out of his hand
Jetson sags against the side of the car, mumbles an alien phrase, clearly the equivalent of "Fuck it
"
: '  - Sykes is in the fetal position on the couch where we left him
Someone is  on the door
He regains consciousness reluctantly
This better be good news or money
He shambles to the door and gets it open, admitting Jetson
Jetson holds the -4 charge in a handkerchief with one hand and gives it to Sykes
Hold this
(lurching to the sink) feel very terrible
Sykes registers what he's holding
He moves to Jetson, who is running his head under the tap
Where'd you get this
man, a human, was wiring it to your car
didn't get a good look at him
(then, registering that it's day; panicked) must call my wife
: - Jetson is starting to take on Sykes' looks, his clothing rumpled and a day old
Sykes has showered and changed so he's not suffering as much by comparison
They approach Sykes' desk
She's going to divorce me
George, she's not gonna divorce you
You mate for life, remember
She's very progressive
'm certain she's considering it
- distributing phone slips nearby notices Sykes
You guys are looking for somebody named Strader, right
Yeah
Fedorchuk and Alterez just phoned in
They found him
(Sykes and Jetson react) Or at least what's left of him, washed up on the beach at Zuma
Sykes and Jetson react again
(continuing; handing over  the message slip) They're still there if you wanna catch them
She moves off
Well, let's roll, George
(with a stricken expression) To the
to the beach
Come on, let's go, dude
Surf's up
: -   - , nice and , showing the slug-mobile turning off
onto a gravel road which curves down the the beach
The following is
as the car approaches the water
(
) Stop the car
(
) Why
(
) Please,  must get out here
(
) Come on, you won't have to get near the water
(
) Stop the car
We see the car pull to a stop in a cloud of dust
- - All right, okay
Keep your pantyhose on
Jeez, when in doubt, freak out, for chrissake
Sykes sees that his partner is covered with a sudden sheen of sweat, his hands shaking
Sykes softens
(continuing) It's all right, George
It's cool
Just wait here, all right
'll be back in a coupla minutes
Thank you
He climbs out and Sykes drives down to the beach
toward a cluster of vehicles: a Sheriff's black-and-white, a coroner's wagon, and Fedorchuk's unmarked sedan
- quick glimpse of a pile of dark yuck in the shape of a person, black and skeletal beneath the remains of a silk suit
Wound around the corpse are streamers of kelp and other high tide detritus
, , looking down at the body
'  is doing a closer inspection
Found his wallet in his jacket pocket
Joshua Strader, big as life
' Jesus, what a mess
It's gonna be a bear to make a positive determination, but it looks to me like he was shot before being tossed in the drink
At least twice-- (indicates where hearts  would've been on the body) -- here, and here
Sykes absorbs this
He rises along with Fedorchuk and Alterez
How're you two doing on Tuggle's killer
The store owner's son is in a street gang, so now we're thinking maybe it's gang related
Yeah, that's real good
You guys follow up on that for a coupla months
Fedorchuk looks up at Jetson standing on the bluff above
Look at your dildo partner
He's too scared to even come down to the sand
(calls up to Jetson, even though he's too far away to hear) You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron
'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk
see how much surfin' you'd do
Alterez shoots a polaroid of the body
Sykes grabs it as it emerges from the camera and walks back toward the car
Fedorchuk flips him the bird
As Sykes rounds the car, he sees that someone has drawn on the door in yellow liquid chalk marker a big star with "
" printed inside it
Sykes looks around
Fedorchuk and the others stand together chuckling, conspicuously not looking in his direction
Cute
- Sykes has stopped to pick Jetson up
He's wiping the "
"  from the door as Jetson approaches from the edge of the bluff
Fedorchuk pulls up alongside in his n
d
sedan
He calls off to Jetson, who is still twenty yards away
Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson
Forget you hip waders, big guy
Lay off, asshole
may be an asshole, but at least 'm a real detective, not some outer shit space thing
Sykes, his face neutral, which we should by now know to be highly dangerous, saunters to Fedorchuk's car and leans against it
Yeah
you're a real honest-to-god detective
Sykes grabs the back of Fedorchuk's head and slams it into the steering wheel, -
, and in doing so, has hurt his hand again (the hand he hit Jetson with)
He shakes that hand while lunging in and grabbing Fedorchuk's car keys with the other
(continuing) Then detect these
Fedorchuk, holding his bloody nose, watches as his car keys sail out in an arc out over the bluff
Jetson, just climbing into the slug-mobile, witnesses the last of this scene without knowing how it began
- - Sykes gets in, slams the door
His hand hurts as he grabs the wheel
He holds the wheel gingerly as he slams the car into gear and hurls gravel up the road toward
Jetson looks over, curious
What was that about
(embarrassed that he defended Jetson) Nothing
On Jetson's confused expression, we-- : - different burger stand
Sykes and Jetson sit across from each other at one of the outdoor tables
Sykes with his greasy burger, Jetson with his mole strips
This time they have no trouble eating in front of each other as they talk
So we've got three guys dead
All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery
Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub
and Porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop mini-mart
(beat) So what the hell's the connection
: - Sykes and Jetson enter the cluttered lab office
Winter is here eating take-out chicken at his cluttered desk
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet
(his mouth full) You mean the Blob
They're finishing up now
Is Bentner here
must speak with him
He went home early -- his kid was sick
Jetson frowns
(continuing) Yeah, but he left something for you
He wipes his greasy fingers on a napkin, then finds an envelope on the desk and hands it to Jetson
Jetson tears open the sealed envelope
The message inside is written in the alien language
(continuing) Does this have something to do with the test he ran that he wouldn't tell me about
- His expression grows stricken as he reads the message
(getting very curious and suspicious now) What kind of test
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day
Did he find anything
Winter shrugs, indicates the message Jetson reads, as if to say, "Maybe it says in there"
(to Jetson) Well
Jetson refolds the paper and puts it in his pocket
He is clearly disturbed by what he has read
He looks at Sykes a moment, then quickly breaks eye contact
It is nothing
Jetson quickly moves off
Sykes hurries off after him
- Sykes hurries to catch up with the fast walking Jetson
They eventually reach the elevators and Jetson jabs the button during: What's this nothing shit
It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now
Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it
(distant, closed) You must leave me alone on this
The elevator arrives, he steps in
Sykes follows
- They enter the empty elevator
Jetson presses the button to descend
No, see,  don't leave you alone
'm your partner
don't work that way
Tug didn't work that way
Jetson remains steadfast
Sykes, about to explode, slams his palm against the red Emergency Stop button and the elevator lurches to a halt between floors
(continuing) No secrets, goddammit
You don't hold back from me
Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now
(agonizing) No
cannot involve you
This is not your concern
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough -4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist
(beat) That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either
Am  right
(he has backed Jetson to the wall by sheer force of will) What is it
(finally) It is called ss'jabroka'
To us it is a potent narcotic
How potent
Like your cocaine,  suppose
The "high" lasts several hours
We would receive small amounts of it
as a reward for our labor
We
You've taken it
We all did
Where did he get it
Was there any of it on the ship
No
am sure not
That is why am so concerned
someone must now be producing it here
(emphatically) But none of my people know how to make it
The process was carefully guarded
(as the enormity sinks in) Jesus, this is major
(then) Why didn't you tell me sooner
Why'd you hold out on me
Your people don't know about this part of out past
And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here
The voltage runs out of Sykes
He seems to understand Jetson's dilemma
George
look me in the eye
George, you don't ever lie to me again
must trust you, Matthew
cannot stop this without you
Sykes stare at Jetson
absorbing the enormity of the earth-shattering secret this alien has asked him to keep
: - Sykes and Jetson move quickly to the slug-mobile
Sykes reaches for the driver's door handle with his punching hand
He winces in pain
the son-of-a-bitch still hurts
He looks across at Jetson opening the passenger door
George
How about you drive
Jetson looks over at him
gently reacting to this vote of confidence
They walk quickly around to the opposite doors, climb in
-     - Sykes and Jetson move down this government-building corridor
There's gotta be some other connection
They enter a door marked
- showing the maze of partitioned cubicles filling this huge room
It's all but deserted
Sykes and Jetson are off to one side with a heavyset woman (human) , who they're shanghaied into helping them after hours
-   ' She sits at her computer terminal
Sykes and Jetson stand behind her as she types in commands and information
She types: Hubley, Warren
The computer screen flashes past various information, then settles on a screen full of information of ,
Here's Hubley
(scanning it) Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year
Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing
Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'
For you, anything
The Operator punches up ,
The screen fills with information
(continuing, reading from screen) Released on November twenty-ninth
Came immediately to
Ten weeks after arriving he took over the abandoned club which is now Encounters
(to Operator) Now the store owner, please
Cecil Porter
She types it in
Released December one
He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in
in April
Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering
He and his wife have one child, a son
Yeah -- we met him
Wonderful boy
close personal friend of George's here
'm sorry, Matt
Nothing here seems to be matching up
But Sykes wasn't listening
He's starting off
an idea forming
He stands there a moment, considering it, his face looking like he's chewing something sour
It's so off-the-wall it takes a moment for him to assimilate it
Then-- Holy shit
(to Jetson) Look what we're staring at: three Newcomers with nothing in common, right
What if it's just one other guy who killed these three
(Jetson looks at him blankly) Three and one make four
Four Newcomers
of totally different backgrounds
(Jetson still doesn't get it) You and the store owner's son -- that punker
Suddenly the realization hits Jetson, too
He looks at Sykes
Quarantine
Sykes spins to the Operator, excited
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing
Sure
Just a minute
She moves up a screen to the top of Porter's information
(to herself) Porter was in Lodge seven seven two
She rapidly types in additional information
The screen shifts as she jumps files
Finally she gets a line that reads:   : She types: 7-7-2
Sykes and Jetson lean in as the screen goes blank
then information flashes past as the computer searches
then, finally: Occupants, Quarantine Lodge 772: , ,
Sykes and Jetson react -- their hunch is coming true
On the computer screen:
,
Sykes and Jetson, their faces bathed in the green kick of the screen, stare without blinking, waiting for that forth name
On the computer screen:
,
- reacting to the name
: - on a limousine door as it opens and a tall figure rises from the back seat
We   to reveal William Harcourt
We  with him as he walks to the n
d
van (from the beach scene) parked in front of the limousine
Kipling is just sliding out of the passenger side of the cab
Quint exits the driver door
Kipling slides open the van's side panel, reaches in for-- -- a large black suitcase
He slides it out
Harcourt nods
He and Kipling start into the club, followed by Quint
- The club is deserted tonight as Harcourt and entourage move toward the back
- Harcourt and the others move up the stairs to the second floor
Cassandra, wearing a slinky dress, is at the top of the stairs waiting for them
She's very uncomfortable dealing with Harcourt
Kipling and Quint continue on toward the office door
Harcourt pauses with Cassandra
He touches her neckline of her dress, letting his fingers linger against her flesh
Quite lovely
(best) What is your name again
(flinching involuntarily at his touch) Cassandra
(a chilling smile) will have to remember that
He continues down toward the office door
Cassandra watches him go
: - -  - They had months in quarantine to develop the plan
Porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug
Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery
Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network
And Harcourt-- Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together
-   - - The slug-mobile skids to a stop at the loading dock entrance
Sykes and Jetson climb out
They hop up onto the loading platform and move purposefully into the well- lit interior through the open door
- It is Saturday night, the plant is barely operational -- only a few  around
Sykes and Jetson move purposefully toward the back
Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart
If the drug is here, we must destroy it
No, George -- you're missing the point
The drug is evidence
We need to have the evidence, ya know
Jetson doesn't reply -- he's focused beyond what Sykes is saying
Sykes spots 'Neal up ahead by the refrigeration door to the
(continuing) That's the guy
'Neal recognizes Sykes and doesn't wait around for the big Newcomer bearing down on him
He dodges quickly through the refrigeration door and swings it closed
Jetson's hand hits the door an instant later, before it is latched, and he pushes it open despite 'Neal's body weight against the other side
- Jetson grabs 'Neal by the collar and drags him deeper into the deserted room
' Hey, what are you, crazy
You can't come in here like this
Hey
Sykes reaches the doorway, stops and stares
So much for playing it smart
'Neal's feet are barely touching the ground as Jetson moves along the row of drug-manufacturing equipment
Finally he reaches a stainless steel tub
he runs a long finger along the inside, comes up with some residue of the drug
It glistens blue on his finger
It holds him mesmerized for several moments
his expression that of a former junkie beholding the stuff he used to covet so
(tentatively stepping closer) Is that it
beat, than Jetson explodes -- he sweeps a rack of equipment off the worktable, savagely wipes the drug from his hand onto 'Neal's shirt-front as he slams and pins the bug-eyed 'Neal to the wall
Uh, George
(in 'Neal's face) Where is the drug
Where have they taken it
' (choking) What drug
This is an oil refinery, you
(pushing harder) ' (unable to breathe) You
can't do
this
George, uh
you're gonna break his little chest bones
Stay out of this, Matthew
(to 'Neal) Tell me where the drug has been taken or  will crush your lungs against this wall
'Neal is experiencing real fear now
Sykes has decided to back Jetson up, for better or worse
He takes the "good cop" role
Don't piss him off, 'Neal
When he gets like this,  can't control him
've seen this before
He got like this once --  saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him
Nothing  could do
hadda go throw up
' (at length, with great effort) They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon
How much
' About fifty kilos
of concentrate
and some street grade
in tubes
Jetson reacts to this
then increases the pressure
'Neal is really in bad trouble now
Even Sykes takes a half-step forward -- thinking Jetson might actually crush this man
Where have they taken it
' Encount
Encounters Club
Finally, Jetson eases off
'Neal slumps to the floor, gasping for air
: - This time Jetson is the Juggernaut
his expression set and hard
as he strides to the car
Sykes practically has to run to keep up
George, c'mon -- lighten up
It's a beauty of a case
Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs
He ain't gonna make any more of the shit
The fifty kilos, Matthew
have to find it
can't let it get out on the street
Why
What's the big goddamn deal
Jetson has reached the driver's door of the slug-mobile, yanks it open
(continuing; as Jetson starts the car You destroy that drug, you destroy the case
Don't blow the whole thing now by not following procedure
(through the open driver's window) Fuck procedure
And to Sykes' shock, he throws the car in gear and peels out
Hey
Jetson accelerates toward the security gate
The guard in the shack starts yelling and runs out as the slug-mobile bashes through the barricade bar
Sykes stands there like a moron -- with no partner, no car
pickup truck carrying a Worker just getting off his shift starts ambling past
Sykes runs in front of it, waving his badge
The pickup skids to a stop
Police
Get out
need this thing
Out, now
The poor guy bails out and Sykes jumps in, jamming it into gear
The truck has seen better days
it doesn't have much power to give as Sykes floors it toward the exit
: - - As Jetson races along the freeway, whipping past other traffic
He takes a hand off the wheel, reaches over and pops open the glovebox
He shoves some maps and garbage aside, reaches deeper inside for something -- we don't see what
: - Cassandra walks a trio of well-dressed   (two alien, one human) through the deserted club
- She leads them to the office door, opens it, then lets them enter ahead of her
couple of them smile at her lasciviously as they brush past
She is about to enter herself when an alien hand flashes in behind her, covering her mouth, pulling her backward away from the door
It is Jetson
He had been hiding behind some crates stacked here in the corridor
He pins Cassandra powerfully to the wall, keeping one hand over her mouth
She struggles until she sees who it is
am here to take Harcourt
Where is he
She hesitates, then decides to cooperate, indicates with a nod toward the office door
In there
(pulling his gun) Show me
- The large suitcase rests on the expansive conference table
manicured alien hand reaches in and slowly opens it
Inside are fifty one-kilo glass tubes full of the viscous blue drug
Also several of the small, individual dispensers
It is Harcourt, standing behind the table in a pool of light, who has opened the suitcase
He is flanked by Kipling
with Quint elsewhere in the room
The room is lit by track light, creating pools of light and dark
The two alien Dealers' eyes widen at the sight of the drug
The human dealer doesn't know what it is
(to alien dealers) It's been a long time, hasn't it, gentlemen
What is it
sweet indulgence from out past
resurrected for our future
Harcourt sees the hungering expressions on the alien Dealers' faces
smiles knowingly
He slides one of the dispensers from the suitcase
(continuing; to alien  dealers) Please feel free to sample the quality
The experience will be everything you remember it to be
One of the alien Dealers takes the dispenser, brings it to his tongue
The other alien dealer turns to Harcourt-- Where'd you get it
arranged to spend some time with three very resourceful men
With a certain amount of coaxing, one of them was able to reconstitute the formula for me
(beat) They worked very well together
Unfortunately, they are no longer with us
but  was fortunate enough to reap the benefit of their endeavor
He indicates the drug
The first alien Dealer sways gently, enjoying the sensation
The second alien Dealer takes his hit
shudders as the first rush washes over him
The human Dealer is no fool
he grabs the dispenser
Let me try some
(he does, immediately spits it out) Jesus
Tastes like detergent
And that's all the effect it will have on you
But when my fellow Newcomers learn they can obtain it here, they will work very hard
to make as much money as they can
to give it to me
Suddenly, a voice from the shadows near the open door to the other office: You haven't told him all of it
Harcourt and the others react
Quint leaps to his feet, caught off guard
Kipling reaches for his shoulder holster
silhouette beside the open door to the outer office nudges Cassandra into the light of the room, then steps out himself
It is Jetson
Quint gets his gun out, is about to aim
when his eyes go wide at the sight of something Jetson holds
It is the plastic explosive charge that Quint was wiring to the slug-mobile
The wires are connected and Jetson's finger squeezes down hard on the detonation push-switch
He's got the -4 charge
Jetson moves forward slowly, holding the bomb in front of him
He is sweating rivers
The others quickly join him
He nudges Cassandra ahead of himself, keeping her where he can see her
(continuing) Just take it real casual, buddy
Keep your finger on that button and don't do nothing squirrely
If you release that button, you not only kill us, but yourself
To get you and that-- (indicates drug in suitcase) --  would do it
He says it with such straightforward eye contact, that Harcourt (and we) know he isn't bluffing
Everyone up against that wall
Very slowly
(to Harcourt) Except you
Harcourt remains behind the desk
Cassandra stays where she is, near Jetson
The others move to the wall
Kipling in particular is going nuts, letting this happen
Jetson takes the "sample" dispenser from the table, tosses it into the suitcase, then closes the lid and locks it
All the while keeping his eye on Harcourt and the others
One small matter seems to have escaped your attention
That-- (indicates suitcase) -- is not on any books as a controlled substance
Legally it might as well be fifty kilos of
grape jelly
The charge is murder
and conspiracy to commit murder
Hubley, Porter, Strader
probably others
There's a flicker of concern behind Harcourt's icy blue eyes
Cassandra stares at Harcourt
You
you killed Strader
Cassandra runs to Harcourt grabbing his jacket
Where's Todd
Did you do something to Todd
Harcourt looks down at her, totally uninvolved
Todd
Who is Todd
(then remembers; smiles) Ah, poor Mr
Watson
Cassandra's eyes go wide as the horror of what he said sinks in
Jetson nudges Harcourt with the suitcase
They start out
Cassandra, wild with rage, grabs Quint's
357 and with a  , brings it up toward Harcourt's face
Jetson drops the suitcase as he lunges for the gun
He manages to knock it away just as she fires -- the bullet going into the wall behind Harcourt
Striking like a mongoose, Kipling leaps forward, grabbing the two lead wires on the bomb in Jetson's hand and jerking them apart
Jetson reacts an instant late
releasing the switch
and nothing happens
got it
Kipling tackles Jetson and they both go crashing to the floor
Quint grabs the gun from Cassandra and hammers her with it, hard
She drops to her knees and Quint viciously hits her again
Meanwhile, Jetson struggles to regain his feet
Kipling rears back and delivers a crushing blow under Jetson's arm -- to the nerve plexus
Jetson instantly folds over forward and Kipling savagely brings up his knee into Jetson's face, flipping him back
Kipling slams him into the wall face-first, pinning him there
Kill them both
Here
(raging) Do it
Quint brings the gun up, places the muzzle against the base of Cassandra's skull, starts to squeeze the trigger
There's a loud
and Cassandra flinches
then looks up
Quint is blown backward away from her
Sykes stand in the doorway from the private office, the Casull smoking in his hand
Quint hits the wall behind him -- only it's not a solid wall, but the huge window overlooking the club
He crashes through it
as the wall of mirror explodes    and Quint cartwheels to the floor in a shower of diamonds
- Kipling shoves Jetson aside, draws his gun and fires at Sykes
Sykes dodges into the private office for cover
The three Dealers dive behind any available furniture
Harcourt snatches up the suitcase and rushes to the door leading into the adjoining outer office
Sykes swings around the edge of the private office door, straight-arms the Casull into the office and fires
Kipling fires back, crossing toward the outer office door, covering Harcourt's back
Sykes ducks back down
An unsteady Jetson rises from the floor, sees Harcourt and Kipling escaping, and takes off after them
Sykes straight-arms the gun into the room again
sees Jetson disappearing through the adjoining office door
He moves into the room as the three drug Dealers, arms up in surrender, rise from behind the furniture
Don't shoot, man -- we're unarmed -- look
Sykes looks at these harmless wimps
then at Cassandra
You okay
(dazed, but all right) Yeah
And he charges out the adjoining office door
-  - Harcourt and Kipling bang down the metal stairs
Jetson is ten feet above them
Sykes flies out onto the fire escape, a few steps behind Jetson
is arriving
-   - Two   bound from their unit and run into the back entrance of the club, leaving the unit running
Two seconds later, Harcourt and Kipling leap down from the fire escape, find themselves near the unit
Here
He throws the suitcase into the passenger side door, jumps in
Kipling dives in behind the wheel, slams it into gear and floors it
Jetson and Sykes hit the ground just as the unit peels out
Sykes raises the Casull and fires at the fleeing car
One slug shatters a tail light, others pepper the rear of the trunk, but the car keeps going
This way
He indicates the slug-mobile parked nearby
They race to it, jump in
Sykes driving
He burns rubber as he pulls out
second arriving police unit pulls into the alley, heading straight for the slug-mobile
Sykes has to grate between the alley wall and the arriving police unit to get past
- Harcourt and Kipling in the first police unit come thundering down the street zig-zagging through traffic
The slug-mobile is three-quarters of a block behind them
-- Harcourt begins fumbling with the dash switches
eventually hitting the right ones and the roof lights and blast on
- It looks like a backwards chase, the slug-mobile chasing the howling police car through traffic
Jetson alertly eyes the approaching traffic -- calls it out to Sykes the way he was trained at the academy
Slow traffic on your right
you're clear at the left rear
(Sykes changes lanes) Careful, red light ahead
With Jetson's help, Sykes is able to dice through the cross-traffic without incident
- The traffic ahead of the police car peels off in response to the approaching lights and
Kipling dodges around the stopped traffic easily
The same traffic that has pulled over for the police car now starts easing back onto the street, cutting off the slug-mobile
- - Sykes' expression tells us he's slipped into the same juggernaut mode we saw during the foot chase in the alley
Yellow light ahead turning red
But Sykes doesn't slow -- instead he floors it
(continuing; wide- eyed) Red light
Red light
- Sykes peels around the merging traffic, cuts across the intersection, and continues the chase
On the wrong side of the road, head-on into traffic
Headlights peel off in front of them as they charge along the wrong side
They eventually catch up to the police unit, racing parallel to it, but with the divider between them
Sykes keeps one hand on the wheel and draws the Casull with the other
He brings it up and around right in front of Jetson's nose, pointing it through the passenger window at Kipling
At that moment, Kipling glances over and reacts to the bore of this huge gun staring him in the kisser
Jetson reacts to the gun in his face
then reacts to something else he sees beyond it
Green light, Matthew
(Sykes doesn't respond) Green light
Now Sykes looks
The light at the intersection has just turned green -- and the rows of the cars that were waiting start coming
It's a wall of headlights coming right for the slug-mobile
Shit
Ss-ai
- Sykes locks up the brakes
Kipling veers around a couple of cars and speeds away
Because of the other traffic, Sykes has only one course of action
He skids a left onto a side street
- Sykes burns rubber down this quieter street, squeals a right onto another street that parallels the street the police unit is on
At the first street available, he cuts back in behind the police unit
- Sykes' car tears along below the overpass -- with the police unit directly above them
An on-ramp approaches for the slug-mobile and Sykes floors it
-- - Harcourt turns in his seat just in time to see the slug- mobile airborne as it flies from the on-ramp, landing a few feet behind the black-and-white's bumper
- With the slug-mobile now, the police unit hangs a right, cuts through a parking lot, and bounces onto-- - The police unit hangs a u-turn into the Second Street tunnel
It clips one of the civilian cars, causing a pile-up of traffic behind the police unit
The slug-mobile skids to a stop, blocked by the clog of traffic in the tunnel
Sykes is out of the drivers door in a flash, stand on the door frame, and yells-- Move your goddamned cars
People climb out of their cars dazed and bewildered -- ignoring Sykes
Sykes slides behind the wheel, bangs his bumper into the car in front of him, and pushes the car far enough forward to get around
He speeds off
/
-- -  - Kipling rockets up a freeway on-ramp
Harcourt smiles with satisfaction -- there's no sign of the slug-mobile behind them
Kipling eases off, blends into the flow of traffic
- Sykes slaloms the slug-mobile through the civilian traffic like Mario Andretti lapping the pack at Indianapolis
- - Jetson spots the police unit in the right hand lane ahead
There
Sykes sees it
Thinking fast, he eases off, using another car as a blind
He waits until the police unit is parallel to an off-ramp, then guns ahead and swings right, directly for the police unit
Kipling looks over, reacts, just as the slug-mobile broadsides the police unit
Sykes forces the police unit up the off-ramp
- Door handle to door handle, the two cars slue to the right
The police unit breaks out in front, but Sykes stays right on its ass
They charge up onto-- - The police unit and slug-mobile -- bumper to bumper at 80 - - As the cars scream along, Jetson cranes out the side window, looking in distress at the inky seawater flashing past below
- They reach the far end of the bridge and skid wide onto-- - clear two lane straightaway near the ocean
Sykes pushes the slug-mobile to its limits, pulls alongside the police unit
The two cars trade blows at 90+
Kipling manages to send Sykes onto the dirt shoulder, slowing him down
-- - Kipling watches the slug-mobile in the rearview mirror, then looks back out the front to see the end of the road coming up fast
Harcourt bellows to Kipling, who slams on the brakes
- The police unit skids to a stop before hitting a chain link fence where the road ends
An abandoned drawbridge and the ocean are on the other side of the fence
With nowhere else to go, Harcourt yells something at Kipling and Kipling floors it back the way they came
- The two cars are racing for a full head-on
At the last instant, Sykes wrenches the wheel, throws the slug-mobile sideways, passenger side first
The police unit smashes into the rear door and fender of the slug-mobile, both cars skidding madly to a stop
fire ignites under the hood of the police unit
- - Sykes sits stunned behind the wheel
Disoriented but conscious, he raises his head, looks over
sees Jetson out cold, his forehead gashed and bleeding
Then he looks over and sees the fire growing under the police unit's hood which is crunched up against the rear of the slug- mobile -- near the gas tank
- Sykes slides out of the driver's door, stumbles to Jetson's door, wrenches it open, and drags the huge unconscious alien away from the cars
He's still dragging Jetson away when he spots Harcourt pulling himself through the smashed police unit window
Bruised and bleeding, Harcourt reaches in for the suitcase, then starts to run with it
With Jetson a safe distance away from the cars, Sykes clambers to his feet, draws the Casull, and starts off after Harcourt
Harcourt reaches the chain link fence leading to the closed drawbridge
He heaves the suitcase over, then starts to climb
Sykes lumbers past the burning police unit
Kipling is still behind the wheel, his head slumped forward
Sykes is just past the cars when they explode -- sending hoods and door panels and glass flying in all directions
Harcourt, on the other side of the fence, grabs the suitcase and limps off into the shadowy world of the abandoned drawbridge
Sykes reaches the fence
Instead of climbing, he simply blows the lock to hell with the Casull, and kicks open the gate
- The end of the bridge is in the "up" position
a huge asphalt slab stabbing up into the night sky
Harcourt runs along the pools of light and dark at the edge of the bridge, the black seawater drifting past beside him
His foot slips once and he almost goes over the side
Sykes -- backlit by the burning cars, the big Casull a prominent part of the silhouette -- just keeps coming
Harcourt reaches the shadows at the end of the bridge -- and has nowhere to go
He is backed into a corner, with seawater on two side of him
Harcourt pivots frantically, sees Sykes coming this way
Harcourt is a trapped animal
His chest heaves in panic
Then his gaze falls on the suitcase behind him
and slowly
finally
a look of resolve comes into his eye
He eases cautiously toward the shadows where he knows Harcourt is
There's some movement among the shadows, and Sykes straight-arms the Casull, his finger white against the trigger
Perspiration drips into Sykes' eye, but he doesn't blink
long moment then-- - Harcourt emerges from the darkness
His face is composed, the superior glint is back in his eye
His arms are held away from his sides at 30 degree angles, clearly in surrender
Sykes cat-steps forward slowly
Harcourt stares at Sykes' eyes, and the desire there that Harcourt will give him an excuse
Harcourt simply
smiles
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history
No, Sergeant -- not history
(beat) Eternity
And now Sykes sees it -- Harcourt has been holding one of the one-kilo glass cylinders of the drug concealed behind his arm
He brings it up over his head, grins at Sykes, then tilts back his head and cracks the cylinder open
The blue gel pours into his mouth and down his chin
His mouth fills
He looks back at Sykes, making eye contact
his eyes mad, defiant
And -- he swallows
Long hold -- then the wallop of the overdose hits him
his face contorts in agony as he begins to convulse
Sykes, wide-eyed, lowers the Casull and watches as Harcourt drops to the ground and goes into a massive violent seizure
His limbs hammer against the deck
his back arches fiercely
It is a brutal, agonizing ten seconds
Then, finally, his body becomes still
Sykes, stunned at what he's just witnessed slowly goes to him and takes his pulse the way he saw Jetson do it
- Sykes stands
He notices the suitcase nearby, latches it, and hefts it
He carries it with him back toward the inferno of the wrecked cars, the Casull hanging heavy and cold in his hand
He approaches the burning cars, heading for Jetson
As he passes the burning cars, we have a half-second to register that the driver's door of the police unit is now open before-- -- a dark figure hurtles at Sykes' back from
Sykes is thrown forward
The suitcase crashes to the ground, and the Casull goes skittering off
Sykes looks up -- to be met by the singed and bleeding nightmare visage of Kipling
Kipling reaches down for the suitcase then Sykes hears it -- the telltale
He looks -- and sees the exotic silver bracelet on Kipling's wrist
It connects for him; this is the bandana alien -- the one who killed Bill Tuggle
Kipling brings the suitcase above his head
He is a half- second from hurling it down on Sykes' skull when -- a Kipling is thrown back by the chest wound
Sykes looks
Jetson, half sitting up, holds the smoking Casull
Kipling recovers enough to come at Sykes again with the suitcase again
Jetson, shaking but determined, fires again, and again, and again
Kipling is driven backward by the fusillade, the suitcase still over his head
until he is blasted at last and forever, suitcase and all, into the molten core of the inferno
Sykes rises, makes his way to Jetson's side
Jetson has let the weight of the gun carry his hand to the ground
Sykes kneels beside him, gently taking the gun from the alien's hand
The two partners remain like this, bathed in the orange flickering glow of the fire
of the drawbridge, the debris, the carnage, and our two cops
: - The police mop-up is winding down
Cop cars, coroner's wagons, fire trucks
We  through it all to find Sykes and Jetson seated on the curb, away from the railing
With Harcourt and Kipling dead, assume you will be requesting reassignment now
(cool) It'd be for your own good
think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more
by the book
(smiles) Still,  gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going
'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective
Jetson smiles
He glances up as they are bathed in red and blue light
patrol car has pulled up next to them
Inside is Wiltey, a uniformed cop
'll give you guys a lift to the station
They're waiting to take your statements on the shootings
(to Jetson) Let's go, partner
(then casually correcting Wiltey as he rises) And it's shooting
Singular
They said two
Nope
didn't shoot Harcourt
he o
d
'd
- We rapidly     as his head snaps around toward Sykes
His expression tells us his blood has just turned to ice
: '  - , shooting from the rear of the wagon, toward the  and  up front
So it's just me and her left in the hot tub, right
You and the blonde
No, man, the redhead
The blonde's gone in the house with some other guy
But a few minutes later she comes back out, alone, when me and the redhead are going at it fast and furious in the tub, ya know
and she sees us, and
she climbs right in with us
You're full of shit
swear it
If 'm lyin', 'm dyin'
And, without warning, , having ripped through the sealed body bag just below : - Jetson is up front with Wiltey; Sykes sits in the back, though he is on the edge of the seat, leaning forward toward the front
Jetson is intently, nervously scanning ahead and to both sides
You are certain this is the route they would have taken
'm not positive -- but probably
(warily) What's this about, George
know that look
(spots something out a side window) There
Go back
Down that side street
Wiltey brakes, backs up, then turns into the side street
as they approach an eerie scene
The coroner's wagon is stopped at an angle in the middle of the intersection, headlights and roof lights cutting into the night, the back doors wide open
patrol car is also here, on the other side of the wagon
There is no movement anywhere near the two vehicles
Wiltey pulls the car up, his eyes like saucers at the eerie scene
He reaches for the radio hand mike
Jetson quickly covers it with a large hand
No
(both Sykes and Wiltey look at him) We must do this alone
Do what
George--
Jetson is already sliding out of the car
- Jetson, Sykes, and Wiltey move warily forward, their guns drawn
They reach the van and Sykes takes Wiltey's flashlight, shines it through the open back doors
The doors are bent outward, smashed half off their hinges
One of the body bags is ripped open, literally split from end to end
The blue and red lightbar on the other patrol car can be seen through the wagon's front windshield
Jetson starts around the wagon toward the patrol car, Sykes and Wiltey follow
Lights all ablaze, it too is abandoned
One door has been wrenched off its hinges and lays in the street, and the front windshield is smashed
Our three cops approach the car, then Wiltey spots something beyond the unit
Oh, God
Sykes and Jetson look
The bodies of the coroner wagon Driver and Attendant, as well as the two  from the patrol car, are crushed and beaten and stretched out on the asphalt
Their arms are twisted as though by a mad force -- each pointing down the street toward the dock warehouses ahead
Wiltey stumbles away, backward
'm calling for back up, now
Wiltey, no
But Wiltey is going
Jetson starts after him
but Sykes grabs his arm, hard, and spins him
What is this
(low) It's Harcourt
Harcourt is dead
No he's not
Not if he overdosed on the drug
(searches for the words) Massive amounts trigger a
a change
Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation
When you emerge you're
(looks at the four bodies sprawled before him) Tell me about it
: - One minute later
on a light shining into , then  to reveal it is one of the door-mounted spotlights on Wiltey's patrol car
Wiltey eases the car down the center of the street
Sykes and Jetson, guns ready, walk slowly along on either side of the car
eyes everywhere
as they move past the shadowy dock warehouses
watching for any signs of movement
Sykes and Jetson converse across the hood of the car as they walk
Their eyes everywhere
never thought 'd say this, but -- for once in my life  think 'm willing to wait for back-up
We can't let him get away
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up
(a difficult admission) Because
because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming
But there's no more drug
You understand that
But how many others will
Sykes looks across at Jetson's troubled expression
Just then, Wiltey spots a flit of movement cutting across his headlight beams fifty yards ahead
Whatever it was, was large and fast
It darted into an open warehouse door
There he is
And Wiltey floors it
Sykes and Jetson watch, unable to stop him
Wiltey
He and Sykes take off running
Wiltey skids to the left, rockets in through the open warehouse door, out of sight
Sykes and Jetson pour it on
They hear a They reach the warehouse door and race through
- ,   the underside of Wiltey's stopped patrol car as Sykes' and Jetson's feet appear around the corner of the warehouse door
The car is still running -- the exhaust pipe still  and expelling fumes
The feet slow
then cautiously start around the car
We  with them as they move around the side of the car
dark liquid begins dripping in
We , to a   of the car bumper
The dark liquid is blood, dripping deep red on the shiny chrome
We farther, and-- -- there is Wiltey's severed head
, resting on the hood of the patrol car
Sykes and Jetson stop dead at the sight
Wiltey's body lies in a heap on the floor near the car
They both stare, then Sykes looks around the shadowy interior of the warehouse, his expression saying: what the hell could have done this so fast
There are two paths to go
Both dark and scary as hell
The sound of a distant   blends with the  and of this waterfront building
- Jetson reaches into the patrol car and pulls the shotgun from the dash mount
He checks the chamber as Sykes checks the Casull
They exchange a knowing look
then wordlessly, they split up
Sykes takes the path to the left, Jetson to the right
As he moves into a dark area
He slowly picks his way along a long wall, having to step over all sorts of piled debris, heading toward us
We  slightly to the left to a door in
The door, already ajar, eases open slightly wider
Jetson hears this
He reaches the door, sets himself, then spins and kicks the door open all the way
There's nothing inside
now
Jetson looks up, sees movement in the distance
It is Sykes, quite far away, in another section of the warehouse
Sykes leaves Jetson's field of view
- '  - Sykes walks around a corner -- freezes, and cocks his head as he hears  -- followed, curiously, by
He eases forward, peers around a bend, and sees -- a table and a chair
On the table is a mini-television, tuned to some local late night talk show
There's a thermos, a steaming cup of coffee, and a Twinkie with a single bite out of it beside the
The chair is empty, except for a jacket slung across the back, the word  stitched on the breast
The guard is nowhere in sight
Sykes moves toward the table, taking in this eerie sight
He looks around, then continues on
-   - Jetson moves among the dark nooks and crannies, comes to a set of stairs leading to an upper floor
The top of the stairs is pitch black
Jetson adjusts his grip on the shotgun, slowly starts up the stairs
-    - Sykes comes to rack upon rack of drying fish nets, hanging from the ceiling
He has no alternate route -- he begins pushing through them
'  - Because of the dimness, he can't see much beyond each rack of nets immediately before him
He keeps wading through -- it's like a house of mirrors, he can't tell now much farther he has to go to get out of the nets, and the deeper in he gets, the harder it would be to go back the way he came
He pushes past one particular rack of nets and looming out of the darkness ahead of him is-- -- a terrifying face
He stumbles back, gets tangled in the nets, brings up the Casull, is about to fire when
he sees what the face is
It's the maiden's figurehead from the bow of an old ship
The wood is worm-eaten and decayed, creating a hideous visage
Sykes stands there a moment, trying to jump-start his heart again
- Jetson moves along the rickety planks
He comes to a door
He eases it open, enters
- Jetson moves into the shadowy confines
He hears an incessant drip from a sink faucet in the corner
He moves to it
Turns the spigot, stopping the drip
Other drips are  from a dozen other hidden recesses all around him
He glances up at the filthy mirror attached to the wall above the sink
Suddenly he sees the movement of something behind him
He spins with the shotgun
huge shadow moves along the wall
He pivots the shotgun again -- toward the source of the shadow
It's a length of black tarp, torn and flapping from the ceiling
Jetson lets out a deep breath
- down a short passageway to an intersecting hallway
strand of something hangs in  in
It makes an indistinct, rhythmic
Sykes moves along the intersecting hallway
The catches his attention
He stops, listens, then starts down the passageway, toward us
He comes forward into the storage room, having to get very close to the strand of something before he sees what it is
It's a double strand of chain,  gently against itself
Sykes reaches out, steadies the chain, silencing it
He considers
It could've been a natural occurrence
or something could have brushed against it, setting it in motion
He tightens his grip on the Casull, backing away from the chain
He senses something behind him and spins
Nothing there
He relaxes
However-- Behind him now, in  , we glimpse movement at the other end of the short passageway
It is a figure, moving slowly forward down the passageway, back-lit by the hallway light behind it, its shadow filling the passageway as it approaches Sykes
It stops, inside the room now, directly behind Sykes
Close enough to reach out and touch him
It is an alien silhouette, but larger, more powerful
Suddenly, Sykes senses something is there
He turns, slowly, and-- - as he steps from the shadows -- just like he did the last time Sykes saw him on the abandoned drawbridge
Only this time it is a horribly transformed Harcourt
His eyes are red-rimmed and piggish
His head is lumpen, his skin thick and hard
His neck muscles are corded -- giving him a kind of hellish cobra's cowl
There is still intelligence behind the eyes -- but it is a feral intelligence now
(his voice a guttural rumble) Looking for me, Sergeant
Sykes stumbles back several steps, wildly brings up the Casull, and fires
The powerful Casull round catches Harcourt in the shoulder, jerking him back
- Jetson, in another area of the docks, hears the echoing blast of the Casull
He gauges as best he can the direction it came from and takes off running
- Harcourt recovers from the jolt of the bullet impact
The cloth of his disheveled shirt is shredded and powder- burned, but the bullet couldn't pierce his plated skin
Harcourt smiles with grotesquely altered teeth, starts toward Sykes
Scared shitless, Sykes rapid-fires
One of his shots misses, shattering a crate beside Harcourt's head
The remaining shots strike Harcourt full on
Harcourt is jerked by the impact of the bullets each time,  in anger -- but none of the hits stop him
The Casull is empty and Harcourt keeps coming
Sykes stumbles back, but Harcourt is on him in a flash
Harcourt grabs Sykes' arm holding the gun, yanks hard
We the  as the shoulder dislocates
Sykes , and the gun jumps out of his hand
- '  - Jetson races in, shotgun ready
The last of Sykes' shots are still
Jetson looks around, frustrated, unable to tell exactly where they are coming from
He sees the likely path and charges that way
-   - On the , Sykes' body is already tumbling down these rickety stairs attached to the side of the warehouse, having been thrown ruthlessly from above
As Sykes' body sprawls on the dock, the massive figure of Harcourt appears at the top of the stairs
Sykes, scraped and bruised, struggles to his feet
Harcourt moves down the stairs, then vaults over the railing the last fifteen feet
Harcourt lurches forward and, with a taloned grip on Sykes' shoulders, propels him down the docks
- The first two arriving black-and-whites skid to stops at the coroner's wagon
The Officers leap out, flagging other arriving units to continue on toward the warehouses
- Sykes is on his feet, but his knees buckle, and he almost collapses again
Harcourt comes at him
Then Sykes sees it-- -- a fishing boat chugging along past the end of one of the jetties
Sykes makes a break for it
-   - Jetson charges out at the top of the rickety stairs, frantically scanning for any sign of Sykes
Then, in the distance, he spots the two figures running along the jetty -- Sykes being chased by the re-formed Harcourt
Jetson gives the water surrounding the docks an apprehensive look, then gathers up his courage, and races down the stairs to help Sykes
- Sykes lumbers along the narrow jetty
The fishing boat is already passing the end of the jetty
Harcourt is fast behind Sykes as he reaches the end of the jetty and vaults off toward the stern of the boat -- landing on the fishing net piled on the rear deck
He yells in pain as his ankle twists under his weight
- Sykes lies there, holding his arm, breathing hard, relieved that he has escaped
- Harcourt can't reach the boat from the same jetty Sykes did, so he jumps on a platform beside this jetty, then onto a second jetty
And from here, he vaults across the seawater onto the boat
- Sykes sees the phantom figure land on the boat near the cabin
The fishing boat chugs up the channel toward the open sea
- Jetson sees this and is shitting bricks
Suddenly the stark  of a police helicopter sun-gun stabs down from above
Jetson looks up to see the chopper coming in low, the sun-gun washing over the docks
- The sun-gun hits Jetson standing on the dock, frantically waving his badge at the 'copter, signaling it down
The Pilot starts to take it down
- Sykes is on all fours, clawing his way up the fishing net toward the back of the boat
Harcourt gets one hand on his leg
Sykes jerks his leg away, and Harcourt's claws dig deep through Sykes' pants into his legs as he pulls away
Sykes  in pain
- Jetson is barely in the seat as it lifts away from the dock
He has to catch himself from falling out the open door
Below, uniformed cops are now seen rushing out onto the dock
On that boat -- out there
Jetson indicates the fishing boat headed toward the mouth of the channel
The helicopter tilts forward and goes
- Sykes manages to pull himself up into the dinghy hanging over the stern of the fishing boat
He pushes to the back of the dinghy as Harcourt's savage visage appears at the bow
Harcourt grins -- the predator with his prey trapped
- Jetson's face is bathed in sweat as he looks out at the channel water racing past beneath
They come up on the boat and the Pilot plays the sun-gun onto the deck, looking for movement, finally pinning Sykes and Harcourt at the stern dinghy
- The Captain reacts to the helicopter overhead, looks back at what the sun-gun spotlights
He sees Harcourt standing at the bow of the dinghy, starting to clamber in
Hey
- Harcourt turns, sees the Captain on the bridge above him
He reaches for a wood-handled gaff nearby
He rears back with it and lets it fly like a spear
- The gaff impales the Captain, off-center in his chest
The Captain, his face frozen in shock, is thrown back against the throttle
The boat lunges forward as the engines  loudly
- Harcourt is thrown into the dinghy with Sykes
As Harcourt recovers, Sykes spots the release for the tie line on the dinghy
He lunges forward, throwing the ratchet
The line plays out, and the dinghy slides backward into water
- Jetson watches this happen
- The dinghy bangs along (at the end of the ten foot tie line) in the wake of the speeding fishing boat
Harcourt claws his way toward Sykes
Water is already splashing in over the stern transom
the dinghy is sinking
Harcourt grabs Sykes' leg and pulls him toward him
Sykes holds on to the stern cleats with all his might
Harcourt yanks him free
Sykes kicks wildly at the ratchet release, trying to free the remainder of the line
Harcourt is coming in for the kill when-- -- Sykes' foot connects with the ratchet lever
The rest of the tie line snakes through the ratchet, freeing the dinghy from the fishing boat
The dinghy is rocking wildly, sinking fast
wave from the fishing boat's wake splashes in over the side
Some of it hits Harcourt -- he  and falls away
Sykes sees this, tries to clamber over the side, but Harcourt is on him again
Sykes' body weight at the side of the dinghy coupled with the rocking motion cause more water to wash in over the transom
- Jetson reacts to Sykes and Harcourt battling in the dinghy below
- Harcourt, who is getting more and more wet,  in agony, thick blood beginning to bead wherever the water touches
Sykes is taking one hell of a beating
Harcourt sweeps Sykes up in a bear hug, is about to crush his rib cage, when Sykes shifts his body weight, knocking Harcourt off balance
Harcourt wobbles, fear on his face for the first time -- then he finally loses it, and the two of them tumble overboard into the water, capsizing the dinghy
- Sykes breaks the surface, gasping for air, frantically clawing with his one good arm at the wedge of dinghy still above the water
Suddenly, behind him, Harcourt's partially melted form erupts from the water, lunges on top of Sykes, and drags him under
- Jetson hangs in the open door, watching in horror, wanting to help, knowing he can't
- Sykes breaks the surface, Harcourt's misshapen lump of a body unmoving but still on top of him
Sykes shoves it away, struggling to stay afloat
His head keeps dunking under
He's drowning
- Jetson screws up his courage and turns to the Pilot
Take it down
Take it down
- The helicopter moves down toward the turbulent water
Jetson hangs in the doorway, watching Sykes' head dunking under again
The helicopter's skids are three feet above the water
(to Pilot) ' '
Sykes' outreached hand stretches up from the water, but the skid is just too high
Jetson has no alternative, and he does the bravest thing he has ever done
He moves out onto the narrow helicopter skid
Hanging on, three feet above the water, he reaches down for Sykes' up reaching hand
The fingertips of the two hands waver mere inches from each other
Jetson stretches farther, farther
and the two hands meet
Jetson winces from the pain of the seawater on Sykes' hand
He starts pulling Sykes up
When-- '        ' His eye sockets are empty and his skin is mostly gone
The nearly skeletal body heaves blindly onto Sykes, breaking his grip from Jetson's, and dragging him under again
Jetson is frantic
He keeps waiting -- but this time Sykes doesn't come up
Jetson doesn't know what to do
Finally -- he leans down as far as he can, his face a foot from the water,  to block the pain, and plunges his own arm below the surface
He feels around, gets hold of something, and pulls
It is Sykes' wrist
He pulls hard, bringing the sputtering Sykes up out of the water
(to Pilot) Take it up
The Pilot does
Sykes comes up out of the water
His feet are just clear of the surface when -- Harcourt's hand and arm rocket out of the water, grabbing Sykes' ankle
Sykes looks down in horror
The helicopter keeps moving up, and before Harcourt's body breaks the surface, the arm tears away from the torso at the shoulder
Sykes wildly shakes the clinging severed arm from his ankle, and it falls back into the water below
Jetson continues pulling him up into the helicopter as it moves off toward shore
- Sykes plops on the floor, soaked, battered, holding his limp arm
Jetson is quickly whipping off his jacket, wrapping the dry part around his own arm, wincing in pain
The Pilot stare down at the circle of water where they just pulled Sykes from
What the hell was that down there
It was weird
Jetson looks at Sykes, wondering if he will say
Sykes looks at Jetson a long moment, then-- Looked like every other damn slag to me
Just plain ugly
Despite the pain, Jetson smiles
: - We are  on Sykes, who is having a hell of a time, trying to tie a tuxedo tie with one arm in a sling reach into  to help him
One of the alien arms is also in a sling
to reveal the alien is Jetson
Both men wear tuxedos
How do  look
You look very good
There's a knock at the door
Sykes opens it
There stands Sykes' daughter, , twenty years old, looking radiant in her wedding dress
She is in a foyer, and behind her is the interior of the church with all the assembled guests, including Mrs
Jetson & son
Ready, Daddy
Sykes' heart melts
Before moving to the door: George, uh
want to apologize now, in advance, for all the rotten things 'll ever say or do to you over the years
Sykes moves to join his daughter
As he does: That is all right, Matthew
After all, you are only human
Sykes, caught off guard, has to laugh
(under his breath) What a wildman
Sykes takes his daughter's arm and the two of them start down the aisle
