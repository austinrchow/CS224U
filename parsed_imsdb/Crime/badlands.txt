by Terence Malick Final Version Dialogue and Continuity The time is 1959
, the 15-year-old heroine, sits on her bed, petting her dog
The    as she talks on (v
o
) My mother died of pneumonia when  was just a kid
My father had kept their wedding cake in the freezer for ten whole years
After the funeral he gave it to the yardman
He tried to act cheerful, but he could never be consoled by the little stranger he found in his house
Then, one day, hoping to begin a new life away from the scene of all his memories, he moved us from Texas to Ft
Dupree, South Dakota
on   of bedroom
-    - The streets and alleys of Ft
Dupree at dawn
On sound we hear the clucking of
garbage truck appears
Details of the mechanisms at the back of the truck
, the hero, a 25-year-old garbageman, kneels beside a dead dog
He inspects it briefly
then looks back at his friend and co-worker, , a stocky man in his forties
'll give you a dollar to eat this collie
Cato inspects the dog
'm not going to eat him for a dollar
don't think he's a collie, either
Some kind of dog
They drive off
Watch your heads
The truck comes to a stop
Kit bangs on the driver's door
Hey
Woody
Gimme a cigarette
waves him off
Kit shrugs to Cato
Woody wouldn't give me a cigarette
(pause) Ever notice he don't talk much
Cato agrees with this
They make a terrible racket, with no regard for the sleep of the neighbors
Holly, whispering some rhyme to herself, twirls a baton in the middle of an empty street
(v
o
) Little did  realize that what began in the alleys and back ways of this quiet town would end in the Badlands of Montana
Kit tries to sell a passing  a pair of shoes
Nah
they wouldn't fit
How do you know
You hadn't tried them on yet
Nah
Gimme a dollar for them
Cost twenty new
The Bum walks off
Kit pitches the shoes to Cato
Why don't you see if they fit you
Cato picks them up and looks at them
Kit is culling through a trash can, looking for valuables
reading other people's mail, etc
(o
c
) This lady don't ever pay her bills
She's gonna get in trouble if she doesn't watch out
Cato, ignoring him, picks up a magazine that is lying in the grass
When the  returns to Kit, he has stripped off his apron
throwed enough trash for today, Cato
'll see you In the morning
He slaps Cato on the back and walks off
Cato throws a mouldy loaf of bread at his back
Catch
What do you mean
He throws the loaf back at Cato
Kit walks through the deserted alleys of the sleeping town
as the
He balances a stolen mop on his finger; he stomps a can and looks around to see if anyone has spotted him at this
As the  end he sees Holly in front of her house twirling her baton
He crosses the street and introduces himself
Hi, 'm Kit
'm not keeping you from anything important, am
No
Well,  was just messing around over there, thought 'd come over and say hello to you
(smiling) 'll try anything once
(pause) What's your name
said mine
Holly
Listen, Holly
you want to take a walk with me
What for
Well
got some stuff to say
Guess 'm kind of lucky that way
Most people don't have anything on their minds, do they
Holly eyes him suspiciously
They walk down the middle of the street
Holly has accepted his offer
Oh, incidentally, my last name is Carruthers
Sounds a little too much like druthers, doesn't it
It's okay
Well, nobody asked me what  thought
They just hung it on me
Holly breaks the silence that follows
You still in school
Nah,  got me a job
(o
c
) Doing what
Well,  don't mind getting up early, so  got a job throwing garbage
'm not in love with the stuff, okay
In the distance we hear Holly's  calling her
She eases off
That's my father
got to run
Hey
wait a minute
When am  going to see you again
Holly isn't sure how to reply
Well,  know what my daddy's going to say
(o
c
) What
Can  be honest
Sure
Well, that  shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage
(o
c
) He'll say that
Yeah
(o
c
) Now what's he know about garbage, huh
Nothing
(o
c
) There you go
Well,  mean there's nothing he wants to know about it
've got to run
She waves goodbye and runs off
Kit waves back
' Holly walks into the back yard, where her father is working
Half-painted signs lean against the garage
Who was that
Just some boy
He throws some paint off his brush onto the ground
Is that going to kill the grass
He flicks his brush teasingly at her feet
She retreats to a chair, giggling
You got some on my feet
What'd he want
Just wanted to know if we needed any yardwork done
said no, and for him not to bother us
Kit is talking with a  inside an employment agency
(o
c
) You ever held another job before
used to throw trash for the City
You lost that one
Wouldn't be here if  hadn't
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for
can't think of anything at the moment
'd like you to write me out a slip, though, proving  came down here
The Clerk leafs through his papers
Well,  think we could find you something
working cattle over at the pens
Kit sighs
Well
what the hell
Just hope there's a breeze
The Clerk gives him a slip of paper
' Holly sees Kit approaching the house
(v
o
) He was handsomer than anybody 'd ever met
He looked just like James Dean
She walks out the front door
Hi
Well, stop the world
Quit my job
Great
Just seemed like the right move
Whatcha doing
Spanish
(o
c
) How do you say "Quit my Job" in Spanish
Something mi trabajo
Kit offers her a cigarette, which she declines
Yeah, well, 'm going to work as a cowboy now
Or thinking about it
It's a routine, like anything
What do you think
don't know
He pulls himself up onto the bannister beside her
Well, at least nobody could get on me about wearing these boots any more
She watches him intently
This makes him uncomfortable
You want to go for a ride
Well,  got homework
(o
c
) Bring it along
His forwardness surprises her
They are walking through the downtown area
Kit kicks a paper bag that someone has discarded on the sidewalk
Somebody dropped a bag on the sidewalk
She appears nervous about being seen alone with him
Everybody did that, the whole town'd be a mess
Hi
He greets a passing stranger
You're a redhead
know
Anybody ever call you "Red"
Yeah, but  don't like it
Why not
Just don't
've got a headache
Yeah
He steers her toward his car, a customized Mercury
As she gets in, he asks her (o
c
) Can  come around and see you tomorrow
(startled) Okay
- We see Kit at work at the feedlot
throwing hay to the cattle, feeding them pills, etc
(v
o
) Kit went to work in the feedlot while  carried on with my studies
Little by little we fell in love
As 'd never been popular in school and didn't have a lot of personality,  was surprised that he took such a liking to me, especially when he could've had any other girl in town if he'd given it half a try
The  includes a shot of Holly running toward Kit's car for some rendezvous
(v
o
) He said that  was grand, though, that he wasn't interested in me for sex and that coming from him this was a compliment
Held never met a fifteen-year-old girl who behaved more like a grownup and wasn't giggly
He didn't care what anybody else thought looked good to him, and whatever  did was okay, and if  didn't have a lot to say, well, that was okay, too
Kit and Holly are sitting under a tree
playing cards on a blanket
Holly surveys the area
What a nice place
(absorbed in game) Yeah, the tree makes it nice
And the flowers
Let's not pick them
They're so nice
It's your play
Holly's father paints a picture
using a stereopticon to help with his backgrounds
with Kit driving down a street in his Mercury
Holly sits watching football practice
(v
o
) Of course  had to keep all this a secret from my dad
He would've had a fit, since Kit was ten years older than me and came from the wrong side of the tracks, so called
Our time with each other was limited and each lived for the precious hours when he or she could be with the other away from all the cares of the world
Kit and Holly are necking underneath some bleachers
In the distance we hear the  of the football practice
My stomach's growling
There's an old Fudgesicle over there
You want it
No
Kit laughs, and starts her laughing, too
Somebody else is going to get it
don't care
Kids eat that kind of stuff in Korea
At this her expression turns serious
Kit in  at a fence in the feedlot, an intense look on his face
of the cattle in their pens
They look numb and morose
of Holly necking with Kit
(v
o
) In the stench and slime of the feedlot, he'd remember how looked the night before, how  ran my hand through his hair and traced the outline of his lips with my fingertip
He wanted to die with me, and  dreamed of being lost forever in his arms
' of Holly's pet catfish in a bowl
of Holly with gloves on carrying the fish through the garden in back of her house
She looks around warily, then throws it out among the melons
(v
o
) The whole time, the only thing  did wrong was throwing out my fish when he got sick
Later  got a new one, but this incident kept on bothering me and  turned to Kit
Kit and Holly walk down a sidewalk in the residential part of town
Kit is consoling her about the fish
(v
o
) didn't mind telling Kit about stuff like this, cause strange things happened in his life, too, and some of the stuff he did was strange
Kit steps on top of a dead cow, as though to convince himself that it is dead
(v
o
) For instance,
he faked his signature whenever he used it, to keep other people from forging important papers with his name
'  - The    to reveal Kit lying in bed
His attitude suggests that this is a scene of her fantasy
(v
o
) And as he lay in bed, in the middle of the night, he always heard a noise like somebody was holding a seashell against his ear
And sometimes he'd see me coming toward him in beautiful white robes, and 'd put my cold hand on his forehead
Kit puts on his jacket and heads down a riverbank to the edge of the water
Holly comes into view, buttoning her blouse
Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to
Yeah
Is that all there is to it
Yeah
Her questions make him uncomfortable
Gosh, what was everybody talking about
Don't ask me
Silence
Well
'm glad it's over
For a while  was afraid  might die before it happened
Had a wreck, some deal like that
Kit points to an uprooted tree lying in the water a hundred feet away
You see where that tree fell in the water
He climbs back up the bank
Yeah
The river must've washed the roots away
You don't care about anything  say, though
Holly walks down the bank of the river
Kit falls in behind her, carrying a large stone
The   with them
You know what  think
What
That we should crunch our hands with this stone
That way we'd never forget what happened today
But it would hurt
Well, that's the point, stupid
She gives him a cold look
Don't call me stupid
Okay, but 'm going to keep it for a souvenir
He throws it awav and picks up a smaller one
Or maybe one that's lighter
He walks over to the car
bridge is visible in the distance
Kit releases a large red balloon into the evening sky
small basket is fixed to the bottom of the balloon
(v
o
) Kit made a solemn vow that he would always stand beside me and let nothing come between us
He wrote this out in writing, put the paper in a box with some of our little tokens and things, then sent it off in a balloon he'd found while on the garbage route
(pause) His heart was filled with longing as he watched it drift off
Something must've told him that we'd never live these days of happiness again, that they were gone forever
Holly's dog bounds through a stand of cattails
Holly speaks angrily to her father, who walks toward the dog with a gun
We do not hear their voices, only music
He shoots the dog and Holly runs off in horror
(v
o
) Then, sure enough, Dad found out 'd been running around behind his back
He was madder than 'd ever seen him
As punishment for deceiving him, he went and shot my dog
Holly's father drags a duffel bag out of his truck and dumps it over the side of a bridge, into a river
It goes under briefly, then bobs to the surface
The current takes it off
Holly sits in the second-story window of a music school
(v
o
) He made me take extra music lessons every day after school and wait there till he came to pick me up
He said that if the piano didn't keep me off the streets
maybe the clarinet would
Kit approaches Holly's father, who is hard at work, painting a billboard along a deserted stretch of road
Kit is eating a peach
Sure is pretty
What'd you come out here for
wasn't aware there was any law against it
Kit sees that this kind of talk will not do
He is silent for a moment, then throws the peach away
You know Holly
well
she means a lot to me, sir
Holly's father goes solemnly about his business
You know, before  met her, nobody could ask me how  was doing with my girl
Matter of fact,  didn't really have one
Is that right
Yeah
Kit walks off a few paces and leans against the father's truck
It okay me leaning on your Willys here
Holly's father does not answer
Listen
got a lot of respect for her, sir
(pause) That's about as good a one as  know to tell you
Well, it's not good enough
(pause) Just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you, Kit
Guy like you
She'd get along okay
And if she didn't, well, she could take off, just take off, (and)  wouldn't mind
'd always tell people  deserved it
Holly's father comes to his feet and fixes Kit in the eye
You get out of here
don't want you hanging around any more
You understand
He lets these words sink in, then returns to his seat
(shaking his head) You're something
Kit waves goodbye
Takes all kinds, sir
He walks to his car, looking back once
of father at work at billboard
Kit approaches Holly's house, collects the evening newspaper from the sidewalk, and knocks on the front door
Holly's father picks her up from a park outside the music school
Kit, when he gets no answer, enters the house
The jeep, with Holly and her father, rumbles down a residential street
' Kit is going through Holly's dresser, throwing her things into a suitcase
pistol is visible in his back pocket
Suddenly, Holly's father appears in the dresser mirror, standing at the end of the hall outside the bedroom
Kit walks forward to greet him
The   with him
Hi
What're you doing
've got a gun here, sir
It's always a good idea to have one around
Kit draws the pistol
He is shaken, though he must have seen this coming
What do you think you're doing
Go on, get out of here
Well,  got it all planned
and 'm taking Holly off with me
He looks at Holly, who has appeared on the landing, uncertain what her reaction to all this will be
Okay, boy, 'm turning you over to the authorities
Kit steps forward as Holly's father starts down the stairs
What for
For coming onto my property
With a gun
No, you're not either
(o
c
) Yeah
Why not
Cause  can't allow it
Holly's father stares at him for a moment, then continues down the stairs
Kit starts forward
Hey
Hey, wait a minute
His shout arrests Holly's father at the bottom of the stairs
Suppose  shot you
How'd that be
Huh
Holly's father does not move
You want to hear what it sounds like
He fires a shot into the stairs
The report is deafening in the enclosure of the stairwell
They exchange looks
Kit's breathing is heavy
Holly's father turns and walks into the living room
Kit rushes down the stairs
Holly shouts his name
Hey, where you going
He fires two shots into Holly's father, who slowly sinks to the floor
Kit unlimbers his shoulder
Holly rushes down the stairs to her father's side
Daddy
This is Holly
Are you going to be okay
Her father does not respond
She looks back at Kit, who avoids her gaze
She gets to her feet and walks nto the kitchen
Kit follows her
Kit closes the back door to the house
came in the front
How bad off is he
(o
c
) can look and see
We better call the doctor
Listen
'll say how it happened, part  saw
(sighs) Well
don't think that'd work
This startles Holly
Kit touches the father's heart
He don't need a doctor
He walks back into the kitchen
Are you sure
You don't believe me, see for yourself
Holly stares at her father
'  - of Holly's house silhouetted against the evening sky
On sound the  of
Kit drags Holly's father into the cellar
sets him down gently, then eases out of the room, taking a discarded toaster with him
- Kit comes up the steps from the cellar
Holly stands at the drainboard
found a toaster
He sets down the toaster and walks over to Holly's side
Listen, honey
don't want to
She slaps him across the forehead
He walks into the now darkened living room, and sits down at the piano
After a moment Holly follows him
~ Holly sits down on the sofa across from Kit
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this
You said that once already
Too late now
Why
They're not going to listen to me
You either
Are you kidding
silence follows
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise
Wouldn't be funny
Listen, 'll be back in a while
He gets up and heads for the front door
Oh
You want to call the police, that's fine
Just won't be so hot for me
There are tears in Holly's eyes now
They exchange looks as Kit opens the front door
Then he leaves
Holly settles back on the couch
'  - The house by night
- Holly comes up the stairs, smoking a cigarette
She walks to her bedroom window
The   with her
Outside, under the street lamp, she can see two boys trading secrets
- Kit puts fifty cents into a gramophone booth
He clears his voice as the machine whirs Into operation
My girl Holly and  have decided to kill ourselves, same way did her dad
Big decision huh
Well, the reasons are obvious, and don't have time to go into them right now
One thing, though
He was provoking me when  popped him
That's what it was like, a
Inserts of the booth's mechanism a light panel measuring off the seconds and the needle on the record
Course nobody's coming out of this thing happy, especially not us
You can't deny we've had fun, though
Which is more than can say for some
Mmmm
that's the end of the message
run out of things to say
Thank you
He gets these last words in just as his time is up
He gets the record and steps outside the booth, into the lobby of a train station
'   -    - Kit slams a ten-gallon can of gasoline down on the piano bench, opens it and begins pouring it out over the interior of the house, kicking aside everything that comes in his way
- Holly comes out the screen door at the back of the house, carrying a suitcase and a painting
Kit appears with a lamp on an extension cord
He sets it down beside a victrola he has set up on a table outdoors
He puts the needle on the record he recorded earlier
Holly watches him as she retreats to the car
(v
o
) Kit left a record playing over and over for the District Attorney to find
He was gambling for time
Kit unplugs the lamp, lights a book of matches and pitches them into a puddle of gas
The back porch of the house explodes into flame
Kit runs to the car with the lamp, caught off guard by the force of the flames
They drive off
/    -    - Various objects around the house burst into flames a picture we saw on the stairs
some peacock feathers, a cantaloupe and a pomegranate left on the kitchen table, the living room, Holly's bedroom, the bed itself, a doll on the bed, an & Root Beer sign outside the house, a water can, flames swirling out the front of the house
Holly's father in  in the cellar, sheet music lifting off the piano
etc
At length the over the charred frame of Holly's bed
Outside a fireman moves with a flashlight through the embers of the house
Holly collects her books from a locker at her school and walks anxiously down a corridor towards the exit
(v
o
) Kit made me get my books from school, so  wouldn't fall behind
We'd be starting a new life, he said
and we'd have to change our names
His would be James
Mine would be Priscilla
We'd hide out like spies, somewhere in the North, where people didn't ask a lot of questions
- Holly breaks into a run as she comes through the front door of the high school
Kit waits for her at the car
There is nobody else in sight
(v
o
) could of snuck out the back or hid in the boiler room, suppose, but  sensed that my destiny now lay with Kit, for better or for worse, and that it was better to spend a week with one who loved me for what  was than years of loneliness
She gets into the car and they drive off
- Kit studies Holly for signs of her mood
How you doing
(neutrally) 'm fine
Kind of tired
Yeah, me too
The car sails down a quiet street
The   with a tree floating down a swollen river
Cottonwood trees cover the far bank
(v
o
) We hid out In the wilderness,down by a river in a grove of cottonwoods
It being the flood season we built our house in the trees, with tamarisk walls and willows laid side by side to make a floor
There wasn't a plant in the forest that didn't come in handy
- Details of the cottonwoods, willow and tamarisk
Music continues under
- Details of Kit and Holly building the treehouse
Kit pounds a log into place wi h a tomahawk; Holly scrapes the bark off a log with a piece of flint; Kit weaves tamarisk branches through the frame of the house
This  ends with a   the four stories of the completed treehouse
(v
o
) We planned a huge network of tunnels under the forest floor, and our first order of business every morning was to decide on a new password for the day
ow and then weld sneak out at night and steal a chicken or a bunch of corn or some melons from a melon patch
Mostly
though, we just lay on our backs and stared at the clouds and sometimes it was like being in a big marble hall
the way we talked in low voices and heard the tiniest sound
The   off Holly's painting, a Maxwell Parrish, onto Kit asleep with his pistol beside him
then onto Holly under a quilt with a box of shells beside her
Her hand quivers once
Kit lifts an egg out of a bird's nest at the top of a tree
He drops it down to Holly, fifty feet below
(v
o
) They hadn't found but one set of bones in the ashes of the house
so we knew they'd be looking for us
Kit made sure we'd be prepared
- Kit cuts a piece of twine that lies across a trail, whereupon a ball full of spikes comes swinging down out of the trees
with lethal force
Kit ducks out of the way
We next see Kit with a dew ag around his forehead, running laps through the woods as part of his training
He exhorts himself to greater effort
(v
o
) He gave me lectures on how a gun works, how to take it apart and put it back together again
in case 1 had to carry on without him
He said that if the Devil came at me,  could shoot him with a gun
Holly struggles through the undergrowth witha yoke over her shoulders, carrying wood back to the teahouse
(v
o
) One day,  carried thirty pounds of wood a distance of five miles
Another day, while hiding in the forest,  covered my eyes with makeup, to see how they'd come out
' Holly has made her eyes up with mascara
Kit and Holly dance the stroll to the sound of Mickey and Sylvia on their Zenith portable
Holly shows a better sense of rhythm than Kit
- Kit lifts a fish out of the river with a crude device like a lacrosse net
Holly sits on the bank In the b
g
The fish wriggles out of the net and falls back In the water
Kit struggles in vain to retrieve it
(v
o
) We had our bad moments, like any couple
Kit accused me of only being along for the ride,while at times  wished he'd fall in the river and drown, so  could watch
Kit throws his net down in disgust, partly at Holly
Take a break
Red
Life of Riley, huh
Holly ignores him as he walks off down the flat
(v
o
) Mostly
though
we got along fine and stayed in love
Holly, in curlers, walks over to where Kit is shaving
One of the chickens died last night
She pats a little water on her face, dries it with a burlap towel, picks up a hatchet and walks off into the forest to cut the morning's firewood
almost stepped on him
Holly sits on the upper deck of the treehouse, reading Kon-Tiki aloud to Kit
"The Kon-Tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions
We had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs
thought at once of suction from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out on the deck and up the mast
" He was nervous
Holly looks at him for a moment, trying to understand the meaning of this interruption, then resumes "Time passed
At dawn, just before six, Torstein came hurrying down from the masthead
He could see a whole line of small palm- clad islands far ahead
" Holly walks down the edge of the river, fresh from her bath
wrapped in a white sheet
The river is raging, with white caps visible in places
strange animal, not a deer or a horse, but like them, moves languidly through the thick of the forest
Holly puts down her binoculars, amazed
(v
o
) grew to love the forest
The cooing of the doves and the hum of dragonflies in the air made it always seem lonesome and like everybody's dead and gone
' Kit sits in the crow's nest at the top of the treehouse, browsing through a copy of National Geographic
amused by what he sees, looking around to find somebody he can share it with
(v
o
) When the leaves rustled overhead, it was like the spirits were whispering about all the little things that bothered 'em
An array of stereo slides is spread out on the leaves of the forest floor
Holly puts one in her stereopticon and studies it
Kit greets her as he walks by with a log over his shoulder
(v
o
) One day, while taking a look at some vistas in Dad's stereopticon, it hit me that  was just this little girl, born in Texas, whose father was a sign painter and who had only just so many years to live
With each of her thoughts a slide appears a canal in Brazil, a camel boy in front of the Great Pyramid
some cows standing in a fjord with a steamship in the distance, a mother with her child, a woman playing the piano as another woman looks on, a family on a lawn, a soldier in a wheatfield whispering something into his girlfriend's ear
(v
o
)
It sent a chill down my spine, and  thought Where would  be this very moment if Kit had never met me
Or killed anybody
This very moment
If my Mom had never met my Dad
If she'd of never died
And what's the man 'll marry going to look like
What's he doing right this minute
Is he thinking about me now, by some coincidence, even though he doesn't know me
Does it show on his face
Kit is fishing with his crude net
He stops briefly to watch a truck passing down the highway In the distance, then goes back to work
This stretch of river seems dangerously close to civilization
(v
o
) For days afterward  lived in dread
At times  wished  could fall asleep and be taken off to some magical land, but this never happened
Kit, frustrated draws his pistol from his back pocket and looks around for the fish that has been eluding him
He does not see, as we do, a  watching him from across the river
He fires at the fish
misses it and fires again
The Man across the river hesitates
then moves back into the undergrowth
- Holly is off somewhere in the forest
putting on lipstick
Kit sits on watch in the crowls nest, a pair of binoculars close at hand
On sound, over the music, we hear voices whispering to them
Kit sees a movement in the brush
moment later a figure appears, a hunter, carrying a gun
Kit shouts a code word to Holly
She takes off running, as Kit clambers down the planks of the treehouse and collects his shotgun
He tells her to hide, runs through the woods and dives in a hole, under a cover of leaves
She jumps behind a log
Several shots of the still forest follow, then the hunters appear, a shoulder here
pant leg there
The music ends as one of them cocks his gun
They pass right over the hole where Kit is hiding
Kit rises up slowly, gives them a gentlemanly word of warning, then shoots all three in the back
He checks to see if anybody else is with them, then calls weakly out to Holly
Holly
Holly picks her way through the brush, back to the treehouse
They are packed up and ready to leave
Kit slams the trunk of the Mercury
Get in the car, Red
He takes a bird cage off the roof of the car and throws it away
We don't need this
He climbs a ladder, looks In the cabin of the treehouse to see if they've left anything behind, then jumps down
He flips over the wicker hemisphere that covers their rooster
The rooster walks off, free
He surveys the woods, then looks back at Holly, who returns his look and gets in the car
(v
o
)Kit felt bad about shooting those men in the backs
but he said they'd come in like that
and they would've played it as down and dirty as they could, and besides, held overheard them whispering about how they were only interested in the reward money
With lawmen it wouldtve been different
They were out there to get a job done and they deserved a fair chance
But not a bounty hunter
- We see a flat expanse of the Badlands
The Mercury appears over the horizon and heads toward a solitary house
man appears at the door of the house, Kit's friend, Cato
(v
o
) We went to hide out with a friend of Kit's from the days of the garbage route
'
Kit gets out of the car, takes a chicken from the back seat and walks over to face Cato
He keeps a safe distance
How you doing, Cato
Not bad
Kit steps forward, rifle in hand, and offers Cato the chicken
Take that sombitch
Cato takes it, a wan smile on his face
What you been doing
Running this place for a fella in town
Nothing much to speak of
Well,  don't notice us hustling trash, either
Kit walks over to inspect the interior of Cato's house
Where'd you get them antlers
(o
c
) They come with the house
He refers to a set of deer antlers, mounted over the door
Kit looks inside, then back at Cato
Oh, Cato,  want you to meet my girl, Holly Sargis
Holly smiles and says hello
They sit at a picnic table under a tree, having lunch
Holly is telling a joke at Kit's urging
Did you hear the one about the guy in the nuthouse that went around naked, with only a hat and gloves on, and this nurse came up to him and said, "Hey, what
You can't walk around that way," and the guy says, "What's the matter
Nobody comes around here
" Anyway, the nurse says, "What do you have the hat and gloves on for, then
" And the guy says, "Well, you never know
" Cato bursts into laughter
Isn't that funny
Cato stops laughing
He wants to give Kit the right answer
Yeah,  guess
(o
c
) She plays the clarinet, too
Holly smiles politely
Don't you ever get bored around here
Sometimes
The other day, though, an old boy was plowing in the field over there, found some old Spanish coins
(suspicious) That's what he told you, huh
(o
c
) No, he showed me one
What'd they look like
(o
c
) Kind of round, like so
Gold
'll show you if you want
Kit and Holly eye one another
Kit sees the chance to make a fortune here
He is careful to conceal his feelings, though
Let me finish my supper
Holly, big-eyed, bites into an apple
Kit, Holly and Cato walk out to the field where Cato heard the coins were found
Holly picks up a pot lid
We're thinking of going down to Texas
Holly wants to visit some of her people down there, but after that  don't know
They say Mexico's nice
Cato stops
Kit
Maybe 'd better get a shovel
Okay
'll catch up with you
Okay
Kit walks out into the field to join Holly
Cato turns back
found a lid
It was laying on the ground over there
Put that down
It's dirty
Holly tosses the lid at him
He picks up some dirt clods and starts throwing them at her
She squeals and dodges
watches them for a while, indecisive, then turns and runs
(o
c
) Hey, you're throwing big ones
Suddenly, Kit spots Cato
Cato
Cato jumps over a trough and comes to a stop in front of his truck, a water tanker
The shovel's in the truck
Kit raises his gun and shoots Cato through the belly
falls, then gets to his feet and stumbles toward the front door of the house
Kit follows him for a while, then skips forward and opens the door for him
Cato falls on his bed and rolls over to face Kit
Kit walks in calmly and picks up a photo on the bureau
(v
o
) Kit never let on why he'd shot Cato
He said that just talking about it could bring us bad luck and that right now we needed all the luck we could get
Kit sets the photo down
(o
c
) You never told me about her
He looks under the bed, then walks out the door
Holly stands near a window
smoking a cigarette
Kit sets his rifle down and surveys the room, which is cluttered with odds and ends
Look at all this junk
How's he doing
(shrugging) got him in the stomach
Holly sits down
Is he upset
He didn't say anything to me about it
He takes a drag off her cigarette and gives it back to her
He leafs idly through a catalogue on the table, then walks over to look in the bedroom
Bunch of junk
Inside the bedroom Cato is still conscious, but his breathing is heavy
Kit walks back to Holly's side
is looking through the catalogue
He stole that cage
saw him doing it
Kit wants this to have been an execution, not a murder
Whatcha looking in there for
We can't afford any of that
(defensive) Just looking
As they bicker in the other room, Cato inspects his face in a mirror
(o
c
) Why don't you go in there and keep him company for a while
Holly walks in the door
Hi
She sits down
That your spider in there
in that bottle
Yeah
What do you feed him
Oh, flies
grasshoppers when  can catch 'em
Does he bite
He never bit me
We hear the sound of a car  in the distance turns and looks
' 1951 Studebaker approaches the house
There are two people inside, a  and a
Kit comes out the front door
The Boy and Girl get out, but seeing Kit, they wait by the car
Hi
where's Cato
Well, he's gone
Gone
Where
He said not to tell
(o
c
) Oh yeah
Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town
You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you
The Boy hesitates a second, then starts for the house
Well,  just need to pick up something in the house
Kit draws his gun
No
You go in there, 'll have to kill you
What's going on
Can't afford to take chances
The Girl is baffled
(o
c
) Come on out of there, young lady
Kit waves them out into the neighboring field with him
Let's us step out in this field here
The Boy raises his hands
Nah, skip that
'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though
Okay
You don't mind
Holly steps out the front door and smiles at the girl
Hi
Holly and the girl walk through the field toward a storm cellar where the boys are waiting for them
The wind is blowing hard
What's going to happen to Jack and me
You have to ask Kit
He says frog,  jump
Okay
What's your friend's name
Jack
You love him
don't know
Holly thinks about this for a moment
've got to stick by Kit
He feels trapped
Yeah
can imagine
Well, 've felt that way, hadn't you
Kit guides the couple into the storm cellar
Okay, you two, down in the cellar
They head down the steps into the cellar, the Girl first
Kit stops the Boy for a moment
You promise to stay down there for an hour
Yeah
You expect me to believe that
He looks back at Holly, as though to ask whether he should
Yeah
Kit nods and waves the Boy down into the cellar
The Boy disappears
Kit shuts the door
'm going to shut the door
Kit sticks a pin through the latch, hesitates, then fires two shots down through a seam into the cellar
He retreats to Holly's side
a little surprised at what he did
Think  got 'em
don't know
Well, 'm not going down there and look
He starts running away from the cellar
Holly follows him storm is gathering on the horizon
Kit offers Holly his hand as they run
but Holly does not see this
' Cato lies motionless, on his bed
Holly steps forward and touches him with a yardstick, like a child touching a snake
(v
o
) Suddenly,  was thrown into a state of shock
Kit, rifle in hand, lumbers out a side door of the house with Cato over his shoulder
He steers for a nearby box car that evidently served Cato as a shed
(v
o
) Kit was the most trigger happy person 'd ever met
He claimed that as long as you're playing for keeps and the law is coming at you, it's considered okay to shoot all witnesses
You had to take the consequences, though, and not whine about it later
Kit opens the doors of the box car
and dumps Cato inside
Before closing the doors he checks Cato's shoes
to see if they are the ones he gave him
Holly looks on from the side of the house, twenty yards away
We're in for it now
If they catch us
Kit looks cornered and defensive
Holly thinks for a moment
What'd you put him in there for
(shrugging) Just to keep him out of the sun
Kit heads out of sight around the rear of the box car
Holly goes back inside
Kit walks up and down the length of the box car, talking under his breath and throwing his rifle from hand to hand, in a state
Kit and Holly travel down a country road in the Studebaker
(v
o
) At this moment  didn't feel shame or fear, but just kind of blah, like when you're sitting there and all the water's run out of the bathtub
Kit, driving, turns to Holly
You tired
Yeah
Yeah, you look tired
Listen, honey
when all this is over, 'm going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak
don't want a steak
Well, we'll see about that
Hey, lookie
He nods at a wrecked car lying in a ditch beside the road
They're probably going to blame that on me, too, bastards
-    - Various shots characterizing the Midwest's reaction to Kit and Holly a deserted street, law officers posing with their guns and ammunition, children walking from class under armed guard, a detective in a trench coat pointing at a pump, a woman calling in her children at dusk, a county official posing with the county records, the court reporter with a book of signatures, vigilantes signing up and being deputized, then riding through the streets of their town in the backs of pickups, a priest among them, etc
(v
o
) The whole country was out looking for us, for who knew where Kit would strike next
Sidewalks were deserted
Stores closed their doors and drew their blinds
Posses and vigilante committees were set up from Texas to North Dakota
Children rode back and forth to school under heavy guard
famous detective was brought in from Boston
He could find no clues
My clarinet teacher said probably wasn't responsible, but others said  was
Then, on Thursday, the Governor of Oklahoma sent out the National Guard to stand watch at the Federal Reserve Bank in Tulsa when word got out that Kit meant to rob it
It was like the Russians had invaded
' Kit and Holly approach a large Victorian mansion
Kit rings the bell
(v
o
) We needed supplies, so we went to a rich man's house
Kit figured it'd be safer and quicker than shopping in the downtown
maid came to the door
opens the door
Hi,  come to check the meter
My tools are in here
He nods at the suitcase he is carrying
The Maid looks at Holly
Oh, this Is Holly
She's from Texas
Kit winks at Holly
The Maid brushes her ears to indicate that she is deaf, then stands back to let them pass
(v
o
) Later we found out she was deaf and we hadn't even known it
Excuse me
They enter the house
Kit leads the others into the living room
The owner of the house, a  , sits in a chair in the corner, reviewing some prints
At the sight of Kit he comes to his feet
Hi
Yes
This your place
Yes
Kit looks around, overwhelmed by the luxury of the mansion
Sorry to barge in on you
Anybody else here besides you two
No
The Rich Man is wary
Kit nearly forgets to explain himself
Good deal
Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while
Couple of hours, maybe
How'd that be
Stay as long as you like
The   across a mural of some pastoral scene
- Holly runs her finger around the lip of a crystal glass
It makes a soft chiming noise
Kit, sitting at the end of a table opposite her, picks up a dinner bell, rings it, then puts It down and regards her solemnly
Next time  ring that, it means time to clear out
Holly, in the next angle, has moved a bust off its pedestal onto the corner of a piano
She thinks better of this and restores the bust to its original position
Kit sniffs at a glass of sherry, then takes a picture off the mantel and studies it
Holly, at the other end of the room
tests the comforts of a chair
This done
she moves to another chair and tests it, too
She makes her hand limp
She watches it swing back and forth
Kit sits in the chair which the Rich Man occupied earlier
He has a thoughtful look on his face
There is a dictaphone on the table beside him
Holly takes a cane out of the umbrella rack, looks around furtively, then steps out a side door of the house
Holly walks down the slope of the lawn
(v
o
) left Kit in the parlor and went for a stroll outside the house
The day was quiet and serene, but  didn't notice, for  was deep in thought, and not even thinking about how to slip off
Across the way she can see a long driveway, with a border of lush greenery and a sleepy cat standing in the sun
(v
o
) The world was like a faraway planet to which  could never return
thought what a fine place it was, full of things for people to look into and enjoy
- Kit talks into the dictaphone, recording some advice for young people
Listen to your parents and teachers
They got a line on most things, so don't treat them like enemies
There's always a chance you could learn something
(he pauses for a moment) Try to keep an open mind
Try to understand the viewpoint of others
Consider the minority opinion, but try to get along with the majority opinion once it's accepted
(again he pauses) Course Holly and 've had fun, even if it has been rushed, and
so far we're doing fine
hadn't got caught
(annoyed) Excuse the grammar
He sets down the dictaphone
puts out his cigarette and leans back in his chair, lost in reflection
Holly enters the room where the Rich Man and his Maid have been put
The furniture and paintings are covered with sheets, suggesting that for some purpose, known only to the family, the room has been set aside
Hi
Kit's downstairs playing with the dictaphone
Sometimes he acts like there's something wrong with his bean
She leans against the window
behind the couch where the Rich Man is sitting
Hope nothing ever goes wrong with mine
Think he's crazy, huh
don't know
He's kind of odd
She sits down beside the Rich Man
(shyly) They claim 've got him wrapped around my little finger, but never told him to shoot anybody
She looks the room over
Gosh,  like your house
Thank you
We hear the  of a doorbell
Kit puts down a copy of the Wall Street Journal and locates his pistol
He starts for the door, then remembers that he moved a picture from the mantel
He puts the picture back in place, checks the chamber of his pistol and leaves the room
Kit opens the front door to find a  on the stoop
The Visitor carries a roll of blueprints under his arm
Hi
Hi
ah, Mister Scarborough here
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu
He's sick
Really
Yeah
'd invite you inside, except it's contagious
Don't want to start an epidemic
No, of course not
It's only that he called last night and asked if  could come by
Well, he didn't have it last night
The Visitor is puzzled by Kit's presence in the house, and even more by his behavior
He takes out a note pad
What's that
Well, 'd like to leave a message, if that's okay
Sure
The Visitor jots something down and hands the note to Kit
You have to excuse me now
have to go back inside
Bye
Kit closes the door
Kit hides the Visitor's note in a vase and bounds up the stairs to the first landing
We're out of here, Tex
He turns back down the stairs
On a rack at the bottom he finds a hat and coat
He takes them with him
Kit walks into the room where he left the Rich Man and his maid
He now carries a bag of groceries under his arm, Hi, whatcha doing
Just thinking
Good a way to kill time as any
She okay
He points to the Maid with his pistol
Yes
Listen, ah
We're going to take the Cadillac for a while
How'd that be
Fine
Don't worry,  won't let her drive
He means Holly
(continuing) Oh, and here's a list of everything we borrowed
Car's on there, too
He gives the list to the Rich Man and signals the Maid to accompany them out
Okay, ma'am, let's go
come on
Kit points the Rich Man and his Maid into a closet
You're my friend, aren't you
Yes
Okay, no monkey business then
He locks the door of the closet once they are inside, starts off, then remembers something, takes a handkerchief out of his pocket and wipes his fingerprints off the door handle
Groceries
With this reminder he collects his bag of groceries and heads down the hall
Kit and Holly come out the front door
Holly wears a shawl over her head as a disguise, Kit wears the outfit he took off the Rich Man's coat rack
He carries his groceries, rifle and a silver trophy he stole from somewhere in the house
That guy could sell that list  gave him as a sample of my handwriting
Holly starts off, (continuing) Hey, why're you always walking ahead of me
Well, why you always walking behind me
Kit grabs the seat of her pants
Don't
Anybody ever done that to you before
No
Positive
Yes
Guess there's no way 'll ever know
For sure
They round a corner into the garden
They walk down the lawn toward the garage
We the off camera
That guy must pay through the nose to keep this place up
Lawn, the gas and electric
Bagworms
Plus the upkeep on the cars
Yeah, you get a little money in your pocket, you think all your problems are solved
Well, let me tell you, they're not
They arrive at the Cadillac
Holly sets down her suitcase and waits for Kit to open the door for her
Kit, who has forgotten this propriety, hurries back and opens the door
He throws the suitcase in the back, goes around the front of the car and gets in
'd like to get out of here
Soon as  start the car
and fix my hat
He adjusts his hat, starts the car and they drive off, past a Rolls Royce Kit has declined in favor of the Cadillac
- The car races across the open prairie
(v
o
) Fearing there'd be roadblocks on the highways, we took off across that area known as the Great Plains
Kit told me to enjoy the scenery, and  did
Holly reads to Kit from a movie fan magazine
"Rumor Pat Boone is seriously considering giving up his career so he can return to school full-time and complete his education
Fact Pat has told intimates that so long as things are going well for his career, it's the education that will have to take the back seat
" don't blame him
"Rumor Frank Sinatra and Rita Hayworth are in love
Fact True, but not with each other
" Kit chuckles at this, which pleases Holly
The Cadillac heads overland, along a line of telephone poles that stretches out clear to the horizon
(v
o
) Through desert and mesa, across the endless miles of open range, we made our headlong way, steering by the telephone lines toward the mountains of Montana
Heat waves rise off the land
mountain is barely discernible in the distance
The Cadillac races through a herd of cows, (v
o
) Kit'd sometimes ram a cow, to save on ammo, and we'd cook it
Tight shot of a clump of salt grass
(v
o
) Once we had to eat a bunch of salt grass
It tasted like cabbage
- over the Cadillac as it races down a deserted country road at dawn, The Cadillac is stopped beside a pipeline waystation
Kit has tapped some gas off the head
(v
o
) For gas we used the leakage from the valves of the pipelines we found along the way
Drip gas is what they call it in that part of the country
The Cadillac roars through a stand of mesquite and disappears into the distance
(v
o
) Little by little we approached the border
Kit was glad to leave South Dakota behind and cursed its name
He said that if the Communists ever dropped the atomic bomb, he wished they'd put it right in the middle of Rapid City
They are camped out in the middle of the badlands
Kit cooks some meat over a fire, Holly, with a map under her arm, points into the distance
That's Montana over there
never been to Montana
Acquaintance of mine has, but hadn't
Never had any reason to
Holly sits down and looks at the map
State bird's a meadowlark
The   across the badlands
There Is not a tree or a bush in sight
It comes to rest on Kit, who carries his rifle over his shoulders the way James Dean did in "Giant"
'
- Various sights of the prairie a distant mountain, a wild turkey, a lizard, a burst of lightening in a cloud on the horizon, a falcon
Kit takes all this in, then he turns back to the campsite
The sun is down, just barely, and the moon has risen behind him
Holly is heard over this last shot
(v
o
) We lived in utter loneliness, neither here nor there
Kit said that solitude was a better word, cause it meant more exactly what wanted to say
Whatever the expression,  told him we couldn't go on living this way
Kit and Holly sit in the back seat of the Cadillac
They have been necking
Her hair is in curlers
(responding to v
o
) Why not
mean, 'm having fun
At least 'm not bitching
Well,  feel kind of like an animal living out here
mean, there's no place to bathe and
no place to get anything good to eat
Well, 'll catch you a big trout
Soon as we get to the mountains
He kisses her
She gives in reluctantly
After a while they break
Everybody loves trout
'm serious
They neck some more
then break again
Kit looks out one window, Holly out the other
train moves slowly across the horizon
(v
o
) In the distance  saw a train making its way silently across the plain, like the caravan in "The Adventures of Marco Polo
" It was our first taste of civilization in days, and  asked Kit if we could have a closer look
- Kit sets a football down on the ground, backs off a few steps, squats and shoots a hole through it with his pistol
To his surprise
it does not deflate
He moves closer and pounds it flat with the barrel of the pistol
(v
o
) Before we left he shot a football that he considered excess baggage
Kit is burying some things from Holly's suitcase in a bucket the trophy he took from the mansion, her stereopticon slides, a doll, a spark plug, a pack of Camels, etc
(v
o
) Afterwards he took and buried some of our things in a bucket
He said that nobody else would know where we'd put them, and that we'd come back someday, maybe, and they'd still be sitting here, just the same, but we'd be different
And if we never got back, well, somebody might dig them up a thousand years from now and wouldn't they wonder
The Cadillac speeds across the plains
plume of dust stretches out behind it
Kit and Holly have parked the Cadillac under a rail trestle train is approaching
They hide beside the car
The train, a streamliner, roars overhead
When it has passed, Holly rushes up the grade to watch it disappear into the distance
Kit watches from the opposite end of the trestle
Maybe we should've tried to hop it
It was going too fast
could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some
(o
c
) Yeah, then we'd be stuck here
Well, maybe we oughta be stuck here
'm not saying that  know
He stoops down and picks up a Pepsi bottle
You're crazy
He climbs over the edge of the trestle, looks back at her oddly, then leaps down to the ground
Holly walks down to meet him
(v
o
) Kit took the bottle and spun it around, leaving to fate which direction we should take
Kit spins the bottle
The bottle comes to a stop
Kit inspects its position
He does not appear satisfied, though
Well, maybe the slope here is throwing it off some
We ought to find a more flat place
How about over here
Kit starts toward her, then changes his mind and heads back up the grade, to the tracks
The   and  with him
Never mind
It doesn't matter
If 'm worth a damn, 'll pick the right direction
And if 'm not, well,  don't care
See what mean
(o
c
) No
Well,  shouldn't expect miracles, should
He stops at the top of the grade and looks out across the Badlands
We'll keep on heading for that mountain
Just remember  said it wasn't such a hot idea
- The Cadillac pulls out from under the trestle and heads down a dusty road alongside the tracks
(v
o
) We took off at sunset, on a line toward the mountains of Saskatchewan, for Kit a magical land beyond the reach of the law
He needed me now more than ever, but something had come between us
'd stopped even paying attention to him
Instead,  sat in the car and read a map and spelled out entire sentences with my tongue on the roof of my mouth, where nobody could read them
- The Cadillac beads off across the plains toward a distant mountain
(v
o
) That night we moved closer to the border, and clear across the prairie, at the very edge of the horizon
- refinery fire
(v
o
) could make out the gas fires of the refinery at Missoula, while to the south
- (v
o
) we could see the lights of Cheyenne, a city bigger and grander than 'd ever seen
' The prairie rushes under the Cadillac's headlights
(v
o
)  felt all kind of things looking at the lights of Cheyenne, but most important,  made up my mind to never again tag around with a hell-bent type, no matter how in love with him was
Finally,  found the strength to tell Kit this
pointed out that even If we got to the Far North, he still couldn't make a living
- Kit and Holly's faces are strangely lit by the dash lights
Holly is absorbed in her map
The radio is on
(responding to v
o
)  could get a job with the Mounties
The Northwest Mounties
Hell,  got all the qualifications
can ride, shoot and
don't mind the cold
Fact
kind of like the cold
Holly looks up from the map
What
Nothing
was just running off at the mouth
as usual
'm sorry
wasn't listening
Holly lights a cigarette
was just talking about going after a job
Hey
don't lip it
He reaches over and takes the cigarette out of her mouth
The to her with this gesture
You know
they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you
(o
c
) Well
'm not going to let that stop me
When the    to him, he is looking at her cigarette
You smoke Pall Mall
Yeah
He is surprised to discover this
Nah, you hadn't seen me when 'm going after something, honey
Tough
He cocks his head just thinking about it
She reaches for the radio to change the station
He pats her hand away
Hey
don't touch that
Nat King Cole
- They dance in the headlights to the tune of " Blossom Fell" coming over the car radio
She is wearing the rich man's jacket
After a moment Kit whispers in her ear
Boy, if  could sing a song like that
mean, if  could sing a song about the way  feel right now, it'd be a hit
They continue dancing
- Two shots of the Cadillac heading across the Badlands at dawn
(v
o
) Kit knew the end was coming
He wondered if he'd hear the doctor pronounce him dead, or if he'd be able to read what the papers would say about him,the next day, from the other side
He dreaded the iea of being shot down alone, he said, without a girl to scream out his name
- Holly yawns with fatigue
(v
o
) Then, for an instant, the sight of the mountains in the dawn light got his hopes back up
Kit shakes his head with admiration and wonder
God, what a sight
Tell me this, honey
What does a little Texas girl like yourself think of a sight like that
She turns to look at the mountains
- Mountains in the distance closer now than ever before
The Cadillac drives up to an oil rig
Kit gets out of the car
Love this air
The  in charge of the rig steps out of his trailer
It seems there is nobody else around
Morning
Say, you got any gas
Maybe
Well
'm sorry
sir
but we've got to ask you for it
Holly walks over to inspect the rig
(o
c
) See, we're about out
been driving all night
Actually,  don't even have time to explain it to you
(o
c
) Well, matter of fact,  don't have any
Just a second now
That's your truck
isn't it
He points to a truck linked to the front of the trailer
Holly looks idly around
Suddenly her expression changes, for what reason it is not clear
(o
c
) You didn't walk out here
(o
c
) It's mine all right
Well, listen
'm going to swap you my Cadillac
The Roughneck does not understand what Kit is up to
Now don't worry
You're getting a fair deal
Hell
what's the blue book value on this thing, Mildred
He slaps the hood of the Cadillac and looks to Holly
She is still preoccupied with whatever it is she has seen, though
(o
c
) Who are you
Name is Carruthers
Believe  shoot people every now and then
Not that  deserve a medal
Holly signals Kit with a nod at the horizon
Kit
Kit looks up and sees a helicopter in the distance
He hesitates a moment, then draws his gun
Okay, friend
start running
(o
c
) Just gimme a chance
Git
Holly moves around the side of the rig and sits against a tire
Kit joins her
Boy
had a feeling today was going to be the day
Helicopter
Yeah
He's not coming to take us for a ride
either
Come on, let's make a run for the car
He starts off in the direction of the car, but Holly calls him back
don't want to
Kit looks at her
surprised
Have you got a better idea
just don't want to go
What
She shrugs
He stares at her for a moment, then bows his head and walks off a distance
What is wrong with you, huh
He kicks wildly at dust
What is the matter with you, huh
Meanwhile, the helicopter continues its approach
Kit walks in closer to Holly
Boy,  don't know what to make of you
People like you
He kicks at the rigs then turns back to face her
You want a second chance, then listen
Twelve noon the Grand Coulee Dam, New Year'ss Day
1964
You meet me there
Now you got that
She nods, bewildered
The helicopter is landing
He grabs a discarded fender off the truck, hangs it over his arm like a shield and runs to the Cadillac, exchanging shots with a State Trooper who has arrived in the helicopter
The Trooper is hit and falls
Kit jumps in the car and roars off
Holly surrenders herself to the pilot of the helicopter and is taken off
Kit pulls into a gas station
He gets out of his car and drums on the roof
Hey, anybody here
An  walks out the door
Hi
Say,, you got any shells for a Savage, a
300 Savage
Nope
Damn
pissed all mine away shooting up bottles
You want to fill her up for me
Please
The Attendant nods
Kit pulls Holly's suitcase out of the back seat and walks over to a trash can at the edge of the apron
Kit throws Holly's things methodically into the trash can
After a while he comes upon a book
He opens the book and looks through it, then turns to find the Attendant staring at him
As he gets to his feet
he nods at the trash can
If you want any of that junk, it's yours
Meanwhile, a police car approaches the station
Kit sees it at about the same time the police see him
He throws his book in the car and roars out of the station
The police car goes into a bootlegger's turn and takes off after him
- Kit heads down the highway
After a while he turns off onto a dirt road
The police keep up with him
He flips on the radio and fires back at them
The dust is so heavy that they have a hard time just keeping track of him
He checks his own appearance and general demeanor in the rear view mirror, then swerves off the road onto the prairie
The police manage to keep up
Together they roar through a herd of cows and barb wire fence
The police car slams into Kit, trying to slow him down
Kit slams back into the police car
They return to the road
Kit makes a ninety- degree turn but the police car loses traction and rolls onto its side, then back onto four wheels again, stalled
Kit sees that he has lost them
He checks himself out in the mirror again, puts on the rich man's hat and skids to a stop
The police car gets back underway
During these last few moments Holly is heard on (v
o
) Often 've wondered what was going through Kit's head before they got him and why he didn't make a run for it while he still had the chance
Did he figure theyld just catch up with him the next day
Was it despair
He claimed to having a flat tire, but the way he carried on about it,  suspect this is false
Kit shoots a hole in the tire of the Cadillac, then climbs up on the hood
We see how far behind the police are
He checks his pulse and jumps back down
He scurries around collecting rocks from the shoulder as the police approach from the distance
He makes a stack of the rocks to mark the site of his capture for posterity, finishing just as the police car skids to a stop
Kit throws up his hands and walks forward to meet them
Their guns are drawn
Hi
Hold it right there
could've held off an army if  could've gotten behind a rock in the mountains
(o
c
) Oh yeah
(nodding) Long as my ammo held out
Right there's where you caught me
He nods at the stack of rocks
The Sheriff frisks him as the Deputy covers
We did it, Ray
You better not leave that Cadillac sitting out here
The Sheriff takes out a pair of handcuffs
Put your hands in back of your head
The Sheriff claps the handcuffs on one of Kit's wrists
Now put the other one on yourself
Kit does as the Sheriff asks
The Deputy holsters his pistol and walks forward to inspect their prize
He and  exchange glances
(to Sheriff) Hell, he ain't no bigger than  am
The Sheriff sticks his pistol in Kit's ear and leads him off toward the police car
You're going to give me a cauliflower ear, Sheriff
The Sheriff gives Kit a shove
He should've thought about that before he got caught
Shouldn't he
The Deputy draws his pistol and fires a shot into the neighboring field
Kit is startled
The Deputy makes the same motion, this time without firing
Hup
The police car sails down an open stretch of highway
Kit thinks for a while, then turns to the Sheriff, who is driving
Think 'll take the juice
Beats me
The Deputy, fascinated, watches all this from the back seat
Kit turns to him
Say, what kind of rifle was that you were shooting at me
Thirty aught six
(o
c
) You ever had to open it up like that before
Nope
Kit turns back around
(reassuringly) Well, you boys have performed like a couple of heroes
And don't think 'm not going to pass it around when we get to town
The Sheriff lifts the hat off Kit's head and tosses it out the window
It rolls to a stop on the highway behind them
You tossed my hat out the window
(o
c
) Wanta sue me
No
Kit
Kit, 've got a question for you
Mmmmm
You like people
They're okay
Then why'd you do it
don't know
Always wanted to be a criminal,  guess
Just not this big a one
Takes all kinds though
Kit gets a smile from the Deputy
The Deputy turns to the Sheriff
You know who that sombitch looks like
(no reply) You know, don't you
Kit is anxious to hear the answer
(o
c
) No
'll kiss your ass if he don't look like James Dean
Kit drops his eyes and turns away, deeply gratified by this remark
The Sheriff smiles at the Deputy in the rear mirror
The car roars past a freight train
Kit stands on the wing of a light plane, inside a large hangar at the local airport
He is shackled in a leather transfer vest
He takes souvenirs out of his pockets and tosses them out to a crowd of Montana State Troopers and National Guardsmen milling around on the tarmac ground below him
How you doing there, Kit
(o
c
) Fine as can be expected
Just locked up, can't move
(o
c
) That's a nice little coat you got on there
You think
it's leather
He takes out his cigarette lighter
Hey, now here's a real prize
must've had this about ten years
Who's going to get it
(o
c
) Gimme that sombitch
There you go
(o
c
) Where you from
South Dakota
Where you from
(o
c
) Here
Want a comb
He takes a comb out of his pocket and pitches it down to somebody
He ignores most of the questions coming at him
(o
c
) Joni James is from South Dakota
Yeah, she got out of there, too
(o
c
) You ever been to Kansas
(o
c
) Hey, Kit
whot's your favorite singer
Eddie Fisher
Who's yours
(o
c
) Eddie Fisher
Damn
Want a pen
He pitches the man a ballpoint
The    to a of the whole scene
(o
c
) How old are you
Don't you read the papers
(
o
c
) You ever been married
No sir,  hadn't
- Various  of the National Guardsmen dozing on the pavement
playing cards beside the hangar, a little bored
Also a shot of Holly with the Sheriff and Deputy
(o
c
) Hey, Kit, you afraid of death
(o
c
) hadn't thought about it much
The Deputy walks up to Kit with some legal papers
Hey, listen, Tom,  don't mean to tell you how to run your show here but these cuffs are pinching
What do you say now
need to get your signature on some papers here, Kit
Well, 've got to read them first
Suppose  could get a Coke while  do
Sure thing
Come on
He gives Kit the papers and leads him out of the hangar
Kit turns back to the crowd inside
You boys keep out of trouble
Don't worry about us
Holly's over here, Kit
if you want to see her
Sure
Holly leans against the fender of the police car
She wears handcuffs
Kit turns to a State Trooper who holds him by a tether
You want to give me a little slack here
The Trooper pays out the slack
Kit leans against the car
He and Holly exchange looks
Don't worry now
'm going to get you off these charges
There's a whole lot of other boys out there
You're going to have a lot of fun
Holly looks down
Boy, we rang the bells, didn't we
Holly does not reply
'll say one thing, though
That guy with the deaf maid
He's just lucky he's not dead, too
Holly does not appreciate the humor of this
Kit, chastened, turns serious
Course it's too bad about your dad
Yeah
We're going to have to sit down, and talk about that sometime
He looks up at the  of an incoming plane
- The plane that will take them back to South Dakota, a -25, comes in for a landing
The mass of Troopers and National Guardsmen, with Kit and Holly, walks out to meet it
jeep leads it down the taxiway
civilian bystander points Kit and Holly out to a young boy he holds in his arms
Kit signs his extradition papers on the back of the Chief Trooper, gives them to the Deputy and shakes hands with the Chief
Thank you very much, Chief Sims
Sorry if  caused you any inconvenience
You didn't cause me any trouble
Thanks anyway
He turns to shake hands with the Deputy
The planets engines whir to life
Well, Kit
Tom
Good luck to you
Thanks
mean it
know you do
Good luck to you, too
Now we go
The Trooper pulls him toward the plane
Kit calls Holly
Come on, Red
- The props start turning
The crowd waves goodbye as the boarding door is closed
The wheels turn toward the sun
The Guardsmen race back to their trucks
mailman carries off the mail bags he collected from the plane
The plane taxies down the runway and lifts into the air
(v
o
) Kit and  were taken back to South Dakota
They kept him in solitary, so he didn't have a chance to get acquainted with the other inmates, though he was sure they'd like him, especially the murderers
Myself,  got off with probation and a lot of nasty looks
Later  married the son of the lawyer who defended me
(pause) Kit went to sleep in the courtroom while his confession was being read, and he was sentenced to die in the electric chair
On a warm spring night, six months later, after donating his body to science, he did
With Holly's last words we   the cabin of the plane
Kit sits next to the Trooper at the back of the plane
Holly sits opposite them, with a Detective behind her
Kit's attention is fixed on the military hat in the Trooper's lap
Sir
Where'd you get that hat
State
Boy, 'd like to buy me one of those
The Trooper smiles
Holly looks up
You're quite an individual, Kit
Think they'll take that into consideration
The Trooper smiles and looks out the window
Kit looks to Holly, to see if she has taken this remark in the proper spirit
She smiles and looks out the window
- '  - An unbroken sea of clouds stretches out before her
