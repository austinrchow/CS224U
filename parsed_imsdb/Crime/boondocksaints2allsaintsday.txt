Written by Troy Duffy September 1, 2007 ,  -- The boulevard is empty, eerie silence
No cars, no people
man walks down the middle of the street, long trench, dark shades
Though he does not speak, we hear
There's two kinds of people in this world when you boil it all down
You got your talkers and you got your doers
We recognize this man as
He crosses Copley Square toward the looming dome of the Trinity Church
Most people are just talkers
All they got is talk
But when all's said and done, it is the doers who change the world
And when they do that, they change us
That's why we never forget them
So, which one are you
Do you just talk about it
Or do you stand up and do something about it
Because believe you me all the rest of it is just coffee house bullshit
-- :   "Ireland" From behind we see two men perched atop a boulder
flock of sheep encircles them
Their army sacks and shotguns are nearby
They roll their own cigarettes with effortless synchronicity and light up
and  MacMANUS (30's) now have long hair with heavy facial growth
Rugged
Piercing eyes
Looking to the horizon
Looks like a storm's comin'
Aye
-- : The brothers drive the flock across jewel green hills
Murphy cuts a sheep from a thicket and sets it off
Peace, they say, is the enemy of memory
So it had been for my boys
2
Connor shares some jerky with a sheep dog as the flock surges
(') For some time now, their past had felt like a dream to them
faded and worn
Murphy touches the faded Celtic Cross tattoo on his forearm
Connor sees
The music takes us to a secluded, pioneer-esque ranch
:  's (58yrs) face as he coughs and watches his sons approach from his rocking chair on the porch
(') And then suddenly, as if not a day had passed
it was back
could see it in their eyes
-- Poppa  and his sons eat a rustic dinner
It storms outside
could feel it, heavy in their presence
Something calling them back
Poppa  looks to his boys who just keep eating
,   -- Very early dawn, shadowy morning light
Connor and Murphy sip coffees and look out into the rain
Lightening lights up the flock
Through the open door behind them, Poppa  stokes a warm fire
Connor touch the Celtic Cross tattoo on his forearm
The boys look at each other as the rain suddenly stops and all the "little sounds" of morning cease
Something's amiss
Thunder
Ominous music as
,   -- From behind, we see a man with a  , staring at the dome of the Trinity
-,  : Crew Cut's boots as he paces toward
The threatening music bleeds over to
-- Just inside the trees, a pack of wolves stalk the sheep flock
-,  :    wolf's paws as it paces toward
We intercut between  and  as chaos erupts

:    Crew Cut quickly enters the church
:    The wolves burst from the tree line
:  frantic priest in his 50's weeps and begs as Crew Cut slams him to his knees with a
9 mm to his head
:   The wolves savagely attack the screaming sheep
:    Muzzle flash, blood splatters on the altar
:
Connor and Murphy blast shotguns at the wolves
One is hit, the rest retreat
The boys perform mercy killings on the wolf and one sheep
Everything calms as Poppa  rushes up with a mag light and stops
He coughs roughly
Moody choral music begins
"And they cried out, How long 'Lord dost thou not judge and revenge our blood upon them that dwell on the earth
" -- The boys toss the wolf carcass onto a bonfire
It rains again
And God said, "All will fear the wrath of the lamb
For the great day of their reckoning hath come
" Poppa  looks across the blaze to his sons
Connor and Murphy stare into the fire, bathed in the light of angry flames
"And they that holdest my name shall come with the shaking of the earth and the roiling of the oceans
" -- Downpour
rugged old jeep tears through the mud
It stops at the farmhouse
Poppa  and the boys come out onto the porch
dark figure with a fedora and rain slicker exits the jeep and hurries to the porch
Meet Uncle  (62yrs)
He wears a priest's collar
Something's happened

-- Breaking news
#1 is live from outside a church
Squads, coroner's vans,  etc
Police hold back crowds
#1 There is no new information on the victim found slain this morning inside Trinity Church
As you can see the size of the crowd here has increased substantially over the last couple of hours
People are demanding answers as to how a priest could be murdered in a church
But perhaps more shocking, we have confirmed that the body was ritualized with pennies in the eyes
Many remember this as the grisly calling card of the prolific vigilante killers known as the Saints, who went on a murder spree here in Boston
:   People scream as they run out of a courthouse
#1
rampage that ended six years ago, when the Saints brazenly walked into open court
:    body is wheeled out on a gurney
#1
(') and executed Mafia Don, Poppa Joe Yakavetta before a courtroom of terrified witnesses, then simply disappeared without a trace
Grainy, unclear security footage of three men walking the court halls, two in heavy black jackets, one in a trench
#1
(') The now legendary security camera footage from that harrowing day, our singular tiny glimpse of these infamous and controversial killers
We are back with Reporter #1 at the church
#1 As police have yet to confirm the Saints' possible involvement, the ominous question hangs heavy in the air
"Are they back
" 5
-- Sibeal, Poppa , Connor and Murphy sit around the table
The boys have a look of controlled anger
Presently
The priest
Did they release his name
No
But  made a few calls, still got some friends in the diocese there
McKinney
Father Douglas McKinney
The boys flash with recognition
(') You knew him
Knew of him
Everybody did
regular Mother Theresa
Youth hostels, soup kitchens
Even made it into the newspapers sometimes
Sibeal considers this
He genuflects and turns
Listen boys
think it's best that ya just stay put and we'll try ta figure out what
Connor and Murphy are out the door and headed for the barn
Confused, Sibeal looks to Poppa , who just sips his coffee
-- : The boys begin to look more like "themselves" as the they cut their hair and beards with sheep sheers
The brothers lift a chest from a hole in the barn floor
They load guns and money into black duffel bags and place their signature rosaries around their necks, clasping their hands in prayer
,  -- Detective  (38yrs) is alone on the alter
Police line all around as Greenly stares at the body like the detective has seen a ghost
He turns and nervously staggers toward the front vestibule
-- Detectives  and  are scared
In hushed tones
6
We need to keep our heads, here
It's probably not even them
Of course it ain't them but that doesn't really matter, does it
Our skeletons just came screaming out of the closet
We're fucked
We're not fucked
Greenly enters from the church proper
Dolly and Duffy turn
We are totally fucked
, "  " Greenly, disguised as a correctional officer, lets Connor, Murphy and Poppa  out of a paddywagon
The Saints enter the Suffolk Courthouse, undetected
Dolly, dressed as a civilian, pulls the fire alarm
The Saints execute Poppa Joe Yakavetta before many terrified witnesses, the alarm blaring in the b
g
,  -- and not just fucked, like elephant dick, pounded in the ass, no reach around, jungle fucked
Now's not the time to panic, Green beans
Oh,  disagree
Now's the perfect time to panic
We're all Accessories to
Don't you fucking say it
They all argue over one another
#1 peaks his head in the front door
The detectives grind to a halt
#1 Her
is ten minutes
7
-- :   a gravestone
"Paul
Smecker,    1956 - 2003" We reveal a pair of sexy female legs, expensive "Jimmy Choo" heels
From behind we see the woman rest a rose at Smecker's Grave
"Legs" turns and walks toward a waiting squad car in b
g
-- Dolly, Duffy and Greenly stand outside in the entry way of the church
Though still on edge, they have calmed
didn't even know he had a protege
What is this bullshit
Duffy whips out his trusty note pad
Special Agent Eunice Bloom, 32 years old
Smecker plucked her right out of class at Quantico
Smecker hand picked her
Aw, man
This brawd's gonna be a nightmare
She was assigned to  two years back
She can shoot a gun, set three course records during her training
Great
bull dike, Annie Oakley wanna- be
We gotta get rid of her
She is also an authority on the Saints case
Which means Smecker must have walked her through it
The cops suddenly flush with fear
And the hits just keep on comin'
-- Sibeal waits as Poppa  thinks, then shakes his head
8
Naw
'm in no condition
'd just slow 'em down
Well, are ya at least gonna try ta talk them out of this
Poppa  shakes his head
(') We don't even know what this is yet
Somebody could just be tryin' ta get away with murder here
Aye
Only there's about a thousand easier ways ta do that
Trust me
Someone's callin' them out, Sibeal
Ya kill a priest in a church and make it look like they did it
Bring 'em back with a vengeance
Don't know who
Don't know why
But someone thinks he's real fuckin' clever
Only one problem with his little plan
What's dat
It worked
Fear and frustration burst from Sibeal
Jesus Christ
'er's too much we don't know and if you're won't at least try ta talk some sense into them,  will
The door opens and in comes Connor and Murphy
Sibeal notes the change in appearance
The boys stand at the kitchen table's opposing end, hands in their pockets
Their resolve fills the room
The brothers face off with Poppa  and Sibeal: a bizarre board meeting
Poppa  cocks a brow at Sibeal who clears his throat
(') Exactly what do you intend to do
Silence
Nobody moves
Connor withdraws a hand from his pocket and looks down
He flips a penny on the table
It clatters to a stop
9
Every last motherfucker that had anything to do with it
-- squad pulls up
Dolly, Duffy and Greenly turn
Game time
How are we playing this
Feds love to pull the divide and conquer routine
We hard line her
Stick together on this
Agreed
Agreed
We're a brick wall
They all nod and stiffen their resolve
Let's rock this bitch
Rockin' music fades in as a uniform opens the squad door
-:     (32yrs) exits the squad and moves toward
She is simply delicious: sexy, blonde hair, a woman's business suit, short skirt, brass rimmed specs
Each detective's face drops
Soon she is before them
Music cuts
She smiles and speaks with a southern drawl a la Doc Holiday
() You hafta be Detectives Dolly and Duffy
Am  right
(extending hand) Eunice Bloom
pleasure
Dolly and Duffy shake and manage a nod
Greenly is still enamored
(') And you must be Greenly
Smecker always said you were the funny one
'sup
mean, what
Yeah, well, funny as in ha ha, though not like funny as in gay cuz
'm not
played high school football
She chuckles
Dolly and Duffy fume
10
Look, with all due respect, Agent Bloom
Special
Excuse me
You see there's a "special" before my "agent
" If we are going to address each other formally, 'd prefer if you popped it in there
Makes me feel, don't know
special
Of course, 'd hoped we could be a little more personable
In fact, 'd like you to call me Eunice
The cops are dumbfounded
Duffy snaps out of it
'kay, Eunice
don't see why the fuck the Fed is
Whoa, whoa, "fuck
" This isn't a "fuck" situation, is it
can see a "God Damn" or two but why skip all the way to "fuck" right off the bat
Let's start slow and work our way up to it
What is the Fed's interest in this
The detectives harden, brick wall
Eunice furrows her brow
Their interest, Detective, is capturing the men responsible for the murders of 22 of Boston's finest criminals
'see public perception is that these boys stepped in, did our jobs for us and then disappeared into thin air as we fecklessly searched for them
The tends to take exception to such things
They coulda sent anyone
They sent me
Why do you think that is
() Well, since we've broken the "Fuck Barrier," allow me to be blunt
() 11
(') It is because  am so fucking smart that  make smart people feel like retards
Now, we seem to be getting off on the wrong foot here
'd appreciate a bit of cooperation
Let's chalk it up to paying respect to the memory of a dearly departed mutual friend
man who taught me everything know
After a moment of consideration, the cops concede with nods
(') Lovely
(re: crowd) Now what's with the circus
The victim was killed late last night
When people gathered for morning mass, they found the front entrance chained and padlocked
locksmith came out, cut the chain and surprise, surprise
Cell phones
Half of them called the cops
Half of them called the media
But regardless
word's out
Eunice turns and looks over the crowd
And it looks like that's just the way somebody wanted it
What say we scrape the shit off this cow's ass, fellas
Detective Greenly
Escort a lady onto the crime scene
What
No, yeah, no
Of course
Greenly escorts her as Dolly and Duffy walk behind, mystified
(') Do you want a cup of coffee or something
Never touch the stuff
-- Eunice stands, looking down the aisle at the altar
Behind her, the Detectives are curios as Eunice slides on pink latex gloves
12
She puts in ear plugs and all ambient sound ceases
She starts slowly down the aisle
Eunice inspects the smashed door of a confessional booth
She looks over the body closely then turns from the altar and walks to the detectives
She pulls her earplugs and all sound returns
It wasn't them
but 'm sure you boys already knew that
The detectives nod
The two "'s
" The victim and venue don't add up
Let's go with the venue first
Our perpetrators are devout
They would never commit such an act on sacred ground
And as for the victim
All their vics were criminals
Clearly not the case here
So, it wasn't them which means this is a local matter and it falls under our jurisdiction
No need for Federal involvement so with all due respect
we'll see you later, Special Agent Bloom
Eunice stands right in front of Dolly
Man,  hate it when people say that
"With all due respect
" Because it is inevitably followed by a disrespectful remark
'll give you an example
With all due respect, Detective, this matter falls under whatever jurisdiction  fuckin' say it does
Dolly fumes
Duffy and Greenly share an "oh shit" look
Uh, so
let's just
what can you tell us about the shooters
13
Shoo-ter
Singular
And  can tell you that he is left handed and how shall  put this delicately
He's a short bastard
() One guy, lefty, short
Got it
Eunice furrows her brow
'll show you what 'm talking about
,  -- Close up on Greenly's enraptured face
We pull back and see he is on his knees before Eunice and staring longingly between her legs
Detective Greenly, you're the victim
David
You can call me David
Very well, David
Duffy and Dolly stand behind Greenly, chest to chest, each mimicking guns to the back of the kneeling cop's head
(') The Saints' signature stance
Copley Plaza Hotel four years ago
Two men of identical height put Yuri Petrova on his knees and each dropped iron to the back of his head
This is torture for Greenly and he turns his head from Eunice's crotch
She immediately adjusts him back into place
(') Eyes front, David
The position of the victim and the angles produced by the killers' stance created a unique scenario
The bullets criss crossed in the skull and exited the eye sockets
Here, this did not occur
The rounds moved on a straight trajectory through the back of the victim's head and out the front
Which happens when
14
Eunice circles around, positioning herself between Dolly and Duffy
She aims both hands to the back of Greenly's head
one guy's holding two guns to the back of your head
One guy
,  -- Crew Cut holds two guns to the back of the pleading priest's head
He fires and McKinney falls
Crew Cut steps forward and we see his face in the light
Piercing, ice blue, sociopathic eyes
,  -- Now, the victim falls forward
If you please, David
Greenly lays flat on his stomach
(') The killer approached the body from the left side
(Eunice approaches) and flipped him to the right
Left handed
Yep, southpaw
,  -- Crew Cut flips the body, showing little respect
He pulls out two pennies and looks at them
He chuckles
,  -- But you said he was wicked short
The Saints were later determined to be five foot eleven inches tall
It's just dumb luck that the Russian and McKinney are the exact same height
Eunice kneels, putting her pointer fingers just below Greenlys eyes
15
(') The rounds exited Petrova's eye balls
Here they came out the lower cheek
She slides her fingers to Greenly's lower cheeks
He's putty
(') Three, four inches below the eyes
That puts him at five, seven-ish
That's not uncommonly short
Eunice stands and points the a broken down confessional booth door
The killer posed as a late night confessor
Once the victim entered the booth the killer had him isolated
No escape
Short stuff exits his confessional and kicks in the door of the priest's chamber
,  -- Crew Cut exits his confessional and kicks in the priest's door
He pulls the terrified cleric out
Close on a gash in the door
leaving a crescent shaped indentation which indicates that this cowboy was wearing a boot with a pronounced heel
,  -- Gave him a couple inches
We're looking at about five foot five, gentlemen
That's wicked short
Wicked
-- We drift over open sea to a huge cargo freighter, the Killian Farris, plodding toward Northeast
16
'    -- Connor and Murphy stack grain
(23yrs) appears
They're brawling in the hold
Better get your bets in now
'  -- Seamen cheer as a large, ruffian  (33yrs) and a Latino fight
David and Goliath
Meet  (30yrs), pony tail, shorn sides and a perpetual smile
Romeo's hands are chained behind him
Romeo bobs, weaves and fakes, avoiding many punches
The Giant spews angry French all the while
The boys step up as money moves and men bet
Connor to the same Mexican Seaman in Spanish
Why are his hands chained
Romeo's fast, man
He says the Frenchman can't lay a hand on him
But he can't hit him back
That's the bet
He's got to last five minutes
(to Connor, English) This guy's fuckin' crazy
The brothers whip out money and give it to the Sailor
Fifty on the Mexican
We track with the fighting
Tattooed across Romeo's back, " " Nearby, French  #1 and #2 scream in their native tongue to the Giant and he stops and rests
You should never fight a Mexican, Frenchy
Pound for pound, the toughest mother fuckers on earth
Know why
We like pain
We like it, Pierre
mean think about it, "tabasco sauce
" What kinda fucked up people would even invent that shit
17
The Giant swings but Romeo slides under his legs
Cheers
Romeo jumps up, swinging his hands under his feet, still bound but in front of him now
(') Don't be scared
Remember,  can't hit you
ain't gonna hit ya
(avoiding blows) Ain't gonna hit ya
Ain't gonna
Romeo catches his opponent's wrist and wraps his chain around kick in the stomach drops the Giant to his knees
Romeo locks the man's head between his legs, scissor hold
(') Ooooo
Found the loophole, bitch
The Giant falls
Romeo keeps his wrist locked as he chokes him out
(') Aughtta be a lawyer
Got the 'fine print on y'ass
Pursuant to
Pro bono
Pari Pasu
'll knock you out on contingency, mother fucker
The Giant passes out and Romeo stands to cheers
Roughneck's #1 and #2 fume as Romeo takes a bow
The boys clap
-- Romeo emerges from the head, chains still on
Roughnecks #1 and #2 move down the hatchway toward him, wielding metal pipes
He looks at his chains
Oh, shit
The brothers emerge from the shadows, cutting them off
#1 Out of zee way
The boys speak French
At first, the Roughnecks are surprised but the argument escalates
The Roughnecks swing their pipes and in a brutal display, the boys dispatch them quickly, leaving one unconscious and the other gasping for air
The boys turn
Whoa
Uh, merci, uh, si vous plait
Just protectin' our investment
Ya made us fifty bucks
18
Oh, thank, God
Irish, huh
Finally some class
'm Romeo
(shaking hands) Connor
Murphy
Why were you yellin' "fire"
heard you were supposed to on t
v
That's if you're gettin' raped
Oh
'd be more inclined to go with something like, " '  , " They laugh as they move to the semi-conscious Frenchman
:    looking up at our trio, Romeo is in the middle
(') We saved your entire fucking country in World War Two
Gee
thanks for the statue
Romeo's foot smashes to camera, blacking us out
,  -- The boys slumber, side by side in hammocks
We pull close on them
Silence
They whisper in unison
Quis praesumis profanus apud Dominus
() Who dares trespass in the house of God
Their eyes pop open
-- Murphy rigs a needle to an ink pen
Connor clicks on a hot plate
The boys listen intently to a tiny hand radio nearby
People are still in shock as Father McKinney was a beloved local cleric
() 19
(') His selfless contributions to the community too numerous to list
In related news, second generation crime boss, Concezio Yakavetta has not commented on whether he fears for his own safety
The boys flash with recognition
Yakavetta
,   -- Rich, Italian decor, long table, laden with food
1-6 sit in utter shock, looking to their boss,   (37yrs) who heads the table
So, there it is
want everyone to feel free to share their thoughts
He returns to eating
moment of silence then the Capos burst into anger
Capo #1 slams a fist down and stands, silencing the lot
#1 can't believe none of us were consulted on this
The disrespect
We'd have never okay'd such a thing priest
It's an infamita
#2 Yeah
Are we not Catholics, for Christ fucking sakes
#3 And just for simple revenge
There's no business in it
You've put us all at risk here
The cops could be all over us
#4 Forget the cops
What about these Saints fuckers
These guys were long gone
And now you're trying to bring the devil right back to our doorstep
Concezio wipes his mouth, stands and adjusts his cuffs
He slowly circles the table as he speaks
20
Six years ago, with the backing of an adoring public, these vigilante fucks put my father on his knees and executed him
in public
Mi Patrigno, a blood relative and benefactor to all of you
Poppa Joe made you rich and his murder remains un-revenged
few roll their eyes at this verbal blunder
(') This too, is infamita
These homicidal maniacs nearly wiped this family out
It's taken a lot of time to build ourselves up again, brick by brick
And now that we've re-acquiesced our original power, can we really afford to have these guys pop out of the woodwork someday and try to finish the job when we least expect it
Now, for those of you who have forgotten, let's recap
These fuckers walk into rooms full of gangsters
(denotes surroundings) Outnumbered, outgunned
They kill everyone
and leave
Some look as if they are starting to get his point
(') You think  don't know that each one of you's been waking up in night sweats over this the last couple years
These sons of bitches prison fucked us with no lube, wiped their dicks on our drapes and walked away
And we been living in silent fear ever since
Oh, we don't talk about it
Rape victims often don't
But it's there
Knowing they're still out there, somewhere
Thinking
what if
Fear and realization
#4 Concezio is right
Pretending you don't got a problem don't solve nothing
Heads nod in shameful agreement
21
Thank you, Doctor Phil
So, let's take a moment to look at the serendiplious, diperous, serendip
() type situation we find ourselves in here
There's a good chance they'll show
No catching us with our pants down this time
We can deal with them proactivitously
The cops were embarrassed by these guys too
With a second bite at the apple, they got every reason in the world to crank up the heat
And as for their doting public
'd imagine they're gonna lose a few fans
Heads nod all around
Sold
-- Murphy sits, bare chested on a crate
With the rigged pen, he tattoos his brother's back
Connor cooks something, in a pot, on the hot plate
The resin of anger is evident
: Murphy's back has the crucified feet of Christ and Connor's shows Christ's downcast head on the cross
The prodigal son, huh
He wants us, he's fuckin' got us
But why would he do something so public
Think about it
People figure we did it
Makes it more likely someone will drop a dime
Way easier to get to us in prison, isn't it, now
The berth door is slightly ajar
In pops a bottle of Whiskey, then Romeo's head
He's expecting a cheer but the brothers have their backs to him
He's instantly taken by their ink
But how would anyone recognize us
You don't remember those sketches on the news channel
22
Shit
That's right
'know, every time they show those composites on and then they catch the guy, it looks nothin' like him
But ours
Just our luck
We get Leonardo fuckin' Divinci as a sketch artist
Romeo listens with suspicion
Maybe we should dye our hair
What
Yeah
These guys are always dyin' their hair
You know, like in "The Fugitive
" It's covert and shit
Connor smirks privately
What color would you dye it
don't know
lighter,  guess
'mean
blonde
didn't say that
California, surfer boy, gay, gay blonde
'm warnin' ya
Just keep your hands off my ass back there and, "stay gold, Pony Boy
" Connor laughs heartily
Fuck you
23
Murphy stabs the ink pen into his brother's shoulder
Connor bolts up, knocking over the pot
Hot water and pennies spread across the floor
Connor pulls the pen out
(') You motherfucker
Romeo steps inside and sees the pennies
Serves ya right
The boys are just about to fight when
Oh, shit
The brothers snap their heads toward
stunned Romeo points to them, then the pennies
(') know who you are
You guys are the fuckin'
Murphy moves behind Romeo, shuts the door and shoves him in
Oh, this is so fucking cool, man
'm from Boston
love you guys
Shit, everybody does
mean, holy fucking shit
Maybe  could get in on this, you know
Bring some La Raza ta this thing
Spice it up a little
Hey, is it true you guys say a prayer before you grease somebody
Connor pulls a gun
The boys jump on Romeo and pin him to the floor
Murphy clasps a hand over Romeo's mouth
Connor puts the gun to Romeo's head
Their faces glaze over, religious ecstasy
And an awesome wailing was heard throughout heaven
Romeo's eyes go wide and muffled cries of terror are heard
24
as the terrible hand of the Lord struck upon the earth
And as Almighty God created you
he now calleth you home
He pulls the trigger - "click
" (') Ooops
Busy signal
We'll hafta calleth back
Let's have a shot while we're waitin'
The boys laugh, snatch the bottle
Romeo is in shock
That shit was  funny, man
The brothers laugh harder
Romeo rolls on his side and slides a hand down the back of his pants
He seems relieved
(') Oh, thank you, Jesus
Thought greased my drawers
-- The boys and Romeo smoke and pass the bottle around
No
But  got conex all over Bean Town
Romeo'll hook you up like a tow truck
No
Why not
We don't hafta give you reasons
Forget it
It's because 'm Mexican, isn't it
25
How dare you, sir, insinuate such a thing
The fact that you're a greasy spic's got nothin' ta do with it
The boys laugh
'm gonna let you have that one
Look
can do this
It's not rocket science
You two find bad guys doing bad shit and you kill them, right
It's not that simple
Yes it is
'pose you're right
'd sorta hoped we were a little more artistic than that
Well, you ain't
Can't you guys see it
This shit's fate, man
Like preordained type shit
Mea fucking Culpa
Why do you think you just happened to be in that hatchway today
Oh, don't start gettin' all super fuckin' natural on us
We saw those guys goin' in there
Ah, ha
That's what you say
say it's because Jeeeeesus wanted it that way
Oh, no
Fine
Then what exactly do you intend to do when you hit
soil
We'll go after all Yakavetta's people and operations till we get to the man himself
Yeah, work our way up the food chain
26
The brothers seem pleased with themselves
So, what's your first gig
What's the first thing you gonna do
The boys look to one another
They're stumped
Well,  don't suppose we have a succinct plan, y'know, per se
Yeah
It's not fully developed yet, y'know, as it were
slow smile splits Romeo's face
You two need to chill in the green room, sip on some Pellegrinos and let your manager handle the details
And you better get my Cub Scout badge ready
Cuz if you want to kick Yakavetta in the nuts, let him know you're in town
Romeo's got an ace in the hole for you
/
, These guys have gone "mad dog" here
They need to be put down
think it's disgusting
wish they'd have stayed gone
don't believe it for a second
No bleep-in way the Saints did it
,   -- The  (50's) sits, arms folded
The detectives are present
Eunice stands before a wall adorned with crime scene photos, reports, Concezio and his Capos
And that's all she wrote
Everything points in the same direction
She taps Yakavetta's picture on the wall
27
Why would Yakavetta want them back here
Him of all people
To have them executed
Revenge
Oldest motive in the book
The Saints killed his daddy six years ago, right
He was inside when that happened doing a nickel for extortion
Yeah
From inside he could only do so much
Since he got out nine months ago, the Yakavetta's have regained their original strength
Looks like their clearing all their open accounts
The Chief rubs his chin
Well
it's a theory
More than just a theory, Chief
She nods to Duffy
's came back
Cold hits all around
Concezio Yakavetta and his six Capo Regime, all blood relatives, have disappeared
So
So, it fits
He's gone to the mattresses with his top brass
He's protecting them till this is over
And word's been put to all his lieutenants that the Saints are to be taken out, on sight
That means his resources on the streets are battening down the hatches, waiting for them to show
28
Look,  been stone walling the media on this thing but the Mayor's been riding me like a rented mule here
got half of New England thinking the Saints whacked a priest and the other half thinking their innocent
Its a powder keg
'm talking riot gear at Celtics games, here
could clear them of this murder, take the piss right out of this thing, keep the peace in the Commonwealth
Gimme one good reason why  shouldn't go public right now
Walk with me, Chief
Let's talk
He stands and she takes his arm as they exit
Duffy quietly closes the door and turns
Hushed tones
This is not good
She's gunning for the boys hard
This brawd, trying to put a feather in her cap is gonna get us locked up
Just calm down
And you know they'll send us to the Hoag
We put half those deranged sex freaks in there
hope you guys like cock sandwiches
Cuz we'll be eating them for breakfast, lunch and dinner
-- The Chief and Eunice walk down the hall
understand you got a job to do, Chief
But if Yakavetta even sniffs that we're onto him, he puts a bullet in Napoleon's head, plants him at the bottom of the ocean and walks
This pint sized killer is the only thing that puts Yakavetta right in the middle of this
It is imperative that we find this man
29
The Chief looks as if he is sold
-- In hushed tones
We need to figure what we're gonna do when the boys show and start doin' what they do best
Cuz that's when the shit's really gonna hit the fan
That's another thing
Everyone's assuming that they're going to come back
mean, we got no way of knowing that for sure
(ray of hope) Yeah
That could totally happen
They could not come back
What dream world did you two just slip into
They argue
Duffy snaps a photo of the dead priest from the wall
(') Point blank
We know the boys
Is there any part of you that thinks they're are just going to let this slide
Believe this
They are either on their way
or they're already here

Three sets of eyes
Our trio is atop a dumpster, peaking over at the loading dock
Chinese Gangsters supervise unloading of crates onto a flatbed

Yakavetta's in bed with the Chinese
They're using international shipping routes to smuggle it in
This is Little Yaka's shit
Connor and Murphy smile

Murphy claps Romeo on the shoulder
You just scored a few points, Rome
Well, dust off my "Members Only" jacket

We hear a stressing motor
Romeo drives, Murphy sits shotgun

The boys, looking more "quaffed," do a pointless slow motion walk toward the forklift, throwing up their collars
Romeo, also looking polished, executes a "Dan Tana" pistol whipping on the Dock Worker who perfectly out of frame

The boys look to each other
Murphy shrugs
Relenting, Connor pulls a metallic object and shoves it in Romeo's hand
You can consider yourself a fuckin' pledge until we say different
Romeo holds up the gun in displeasure, a tiny
22 caliber lady's purse pistol
Murphy snickers
Can  consider myself your girlfriend, too
That's what you get
Is there a problem
(beat, fuming) It's fine
Connor scopes the warehouse
Murphy claps Romeo on the shoulder
Don't worry, Rome
Shit like this builds character
Yeah, the character of a little bitch
Now, dat's just unprofessional
He turns and joins his brother as Romeo continues sulking

Oh, Jeez, that's not
So you spoke to Kuntsler

Greenly, still rockin', doesn't notice
If it's confirmed that the Saints are back and too many bodies start showing up with pocket change

Just work fast
She smiles and nods
Greenly removes his ear pieces

,  -- On the flatbed, the brothers shovel coffee out of the final crate which rests on the forks of the lift
Below them stands the Dock Worker holding his bleeding head
Romeo covers him with his 22
You didn't have to bash me in the skull
Sorry, man
We got a plan going, here
Technically,  was supposed to knock you out
Christ
You got a gun
You could have just pointed it at me and said
Connor points his gun at the Dock Worker
You got it
He runs off
Romeo turns up to them
So, let's not let this one, small incident get in the way of
Shut up and get behind the fuckin' wheel

The crate blocks Romeo from view
He's driving blind as the rickety crate jiggles on the forks

Jesus
What the fuck's he doin'
He can't see where he's goin'
Murphy peaks through a crack
Shit
Tell him to go left, now
Connor puts his mouth to a knot hole
Go left

Connor sticks his finger out the hole and points
Romeo wrenches the wheel and they narrowly avoid machinery
The crate rocks

This is a stupid plan

The boys start elbowing each other in a close quarters scrap while hurling obscenities

They are headed for a "Mechanic's Well

Tell him to stop
Connor slams his mouth to the knot hole

Suddenly, Romeo whips it in reverse, cranks the wheel guns it and navigates the well
Speeds toward the gangsters

Romeo dives off and rolls behind some machines

Romeo fires his useless 22
In the ensuing fire fight the brothers kill all but Chinese Gangster #3
The forklift crashes through the table with the stacked heroin

Never steered me wrong
He says its this guy

He's trusted bruglione to Yakavetta but not blood
He's been left control of the streets
He's running all of it
Eunice looks over the mug shot
They call him "Gorgeous" cuz he likes his silk suits and jewelry
He's even got the 'out of season' fake bake going on, a real peacock, this guy
Yeah,  heard of this rodeo clown
Duffy approaches, hands Eunice a tiny bullet in a baggy
Ballistics just dug it out
They all look perplexed

They all blank stare Greenly for a moment
Moving on

Ballistics is reading three shooters
This is one of them
Well, 'm having a hard time believing that one of the three most lethal individuals on the planet just switched over to bird shot
Maybe we're reading it wrong
The priest was a frame job, right
Yeah, maybe somebody's trying to eliminate some competition here
Eunice considers this
The Detectives seem hopeful
No, sir
It's them
But we just might have ourselves a change in the line up, here
The detectives all look at one another nervously
Fine, they're back
What's the plan
Hell, we've just been called up to the big show
We are tracking multiple perpetrators, gentlemen
The plan
We keep our ear to the ground and try to figure out where Yakavetta's hiding

INTERpol's still working it
Should only be another couple of hours
Lovely
Anything else
Yeah
Nothing big
We just dumped a text message from George's cell
Just two words
"El Cava
" It's a Mexican joint down by the docks
He sent it to his enforcer, Jo Jo Rhama
Guess gangsters gotta eat too, huh
think 'll drop in on their supper, see if  can shake them up a little
You need a body guard
No thank you, Mike Tyson
Bye now
Bye
She hangs up and we are left with Greenly
Red handed
(') Oh, shit

" ,"  -- Close up, three shot
George, looking very uncomfortable, is flanked by the brothers
He is positioned to covertly view the restaurant from the kitchen
We see  BRUGLIONEs #1 - #3 and   #1 and #2 are at the bar
Just two more to go
Uh
You guys are gonna let me go, right
We'll see, won't we
George grimaces
Looks as if he'll cry
Jesus, this is some embarrassing shit
We see the three men from behind
George is still in his Speedos, which now have a pronounced shit stain in back
,  -- Romeo, frazzled and in a busboy uniform, has got two blenders of margaritas going
The Brugliones mow through appetizers
Northside doesn't interact with Southside and there is an empty bar stool between them
Bruglione #1 slides Romeo a platter
#1 Yo, spicaroo
More nachos and mas salsa, capisce
#1 Hey and  need a refill there, pepe
Si, muchachos
#3 enters behind everyone
All suddenly turn, going for their guns
#3 Whoa
Easy
Jesus
Everyone calms
Bruglione #3 gives a respectful nod to the Northside guys but sits with his own
58
,  -- We do not see George just below frame as the boys are "working on him" in some way, putting on finishing touches
Romeo barrels in
These dagos are getting antsy and 'm getting Spicaroo'd and Pepe'd
The kid's about to go Poncho fucking Villa out there
Stick it out
Waitin' on one more
-- Jo Jo exits his Cadillac and walks toward El Cava
There is a "closed for private function" sign on the door
,  -- Crew Cut watches Jo Jo
He dials his cell
-- From behind we see the Old Man gardening
He answers a ringing phone, nearby
We do not see his face
-- The following conversation is in Italian
He is not with them
Are you certain
Yes
It is only the sons
They have a Spaniard with them
They will slaughter everyone
Let them
If you kill the sons
the father will come
Crew Cut develops a sinister smile
,  -- Connor watches Jo Jo greet the others
He turns to Romeo who is angrily cooking up a storm
59
The gang's all here
Without missing a beat, Romeo slams the hot pans into a dish sink
He stands fuming with his hands on his hips
Gimme my fucking bee bee gun
Naw
You've earned your stripes, Rome
Murphy throws him a
9 mm
Romeo smiles
-- So
where's Gorgeous
Suddenly, George comes rolling out of the kitchen, unconscious and tied, face down, to a bus cart
There is writing on his back
Everyone pulls their weapons and moves toward
#2 What the fuck is going on, here
#2 Where's that spic barkeep
Yo, Pepe
Where you at
As the gangsters achieve the cart, the brothers creep over the bar in the b
g
Brugliones look down on George, painted on his back
#3 "Erin go brah
" What the hell does that mean
Connor and Murphy are standing 25 feet behind them
It's Irish for "You're fucked
" Hard core music as the Brugliones turn in horror
Everyone begins firing and we have slow motion gunplay to pulsating music
Several are chewed up as chests explode and they are blown into George on the cart, knocking it over
George comes to
Romeo appears and tears in, sending several more crashing into the salad bar
Murphy, while firing, dives back over the bar as bottles explode
Connor rapid fires as he dives into a booth
60
The boys rise and lay out a second barrage, blasting the rest into buffet tables and a soda fountain
The music cuts
Viva La Mejico, bitches
George bolts up
The bus cart is still tied to his fat belly
Uh, 've seen the light
You guys have really turned me around on this
'm like born again and shit
swear
(to Connor) What do ya think
Let him go
Connor slips one bullet in a revolver, spins the barrel and snaps it shut
He points it to George's forehead
George weeps in earnest
We'll let God decide if you get a second chance
He slowly cocks the hammer back, pulls trigger, "click
" (') Well, praise the Lord
The terrified ex-gangster staggers toward an exit while wriggling out of his bonds
Just as he touches the door
(') George
(George turns) All good boys go to heaven
George nods and exits
Romeo is confused as our trio gathers
Connor tosses the bullet he palmed to Romeo and he nods
Now, that was, perhaps the finest example of spiritual guidance that have ever had the good fortune ta witness
Well, thank you very much
Mysterious ways
Mysterious ways
-: Suddenly, Eunice bursts through the kitchen door and levels her weapon at the brothers and Romeo
Romeo levels back
61
Eunice fires as the boys dive on Romeo
Crew Cut is revealed behind our trio, firing from the shadows
Eunice and Crew Cut exchange fire as the boys reload
Eunice hits Crew Cut in the side
The assassin has a moment of outrage but persists firing as he makes a hasty exit
In the confusion it is a few moments before anyone realizes he is gone
Silence falls
Presently, Romeo and the boys bolt up
Romeo goes for the door and the boys level at Eunice
(') Drop the gun
Drop it
She "places" her gun on a nearby table
Easy fellas
'm alone
The boys are before her as Romeo returns
He's gone
Who are ya
My name is Eunice Bloom
and 'm your new guardian angel
torch was passed to me by a mutual friend, gone but not forgotten
The boys reholster
She drops her arms
We heard about Smecker
He was a good man
Aye
You have our condolences
And you have mine
They shake
Murphy
62
Very well
Connor, Murphy
The boys nod
Romeo points to the front door
Who the fuck was that guy
That,  suspect, was the shooter you boys have been looking for
The boys look at each other
Frustration
Anger
Fucking
what the fuck
Who the fuck is this brawd
And what the fuck's going on, here
Let's speed this up before your new sidekick's got to dig any deeper into his impressive vocabulary
The boys chuckle
Oh, no you didn't
am an  agent who is controlling this investigation from within, in order to ensure that you gentlemen never see the inside of a prison cell
am conspiring to do this with three like minded individuals who have aided you in the past
Though  have yet to inform them of my agenda because, well, girl's gotta have her fun
Dolly, Duffy and Greenly
The very same
How are the lads
Two of them are scared
One's just horny
63
Bet'cha  can guess which one
Bet'cha can but let's save it for group
Right now, we have a big problem
What's that
Eunice denotes the bodies
This
simply won't do
We made a deal
The big fish step in if your body count gets too high and
(re: carnage) you have been very naughty boys
Rockin' music overtakes as we
-- With Eunice directing them, the boys and Romeo restage the crime scene
With a squeegee they move pools of blood across the linoleum floor and re-position bodies
The boys wrap Jo Jo's body in a tarp and put it in the Green Machine
Romeo creates blood splatter with a turkey baster
Romeo and the brothers place the guns they used in the hands of dead gangsters as Eunice drops bullet casings in carefully chosen spots
Romeo and the brothers leave with the utensils used to rig the scene
The music fades, leaving Eunice in the center of
-- Silence
She removes her ear plugs and the sound returns
We are on a very different looking scene
, forensics, even Dolly and Duffy wait with baited breath
Greenly is not present
'kay
Here's how it all went down
Dolly and Duffy open their notepads
,   -- Northside stands facing off with the Southside
All brugliones are frozen in place
Eunice saunters down the middle
Cool music
64
secret gathering of the Brugliones
The topic of discussion
Weak leadership and betrayal
#1 Yakavetta's hiding from these Jesus Freaks and making us look like pussies
#1 And he's hanging all of us out to dry to boot
pause as they size each other up
#2 All right
'll be the first to say it
The enemy of my enemy is my friend
So, even with all their old vendettas
#2 say fuck the Yakavettas
And there it is
Guess what comes next
Eunice points to men as he moves down the line
(') Red Rover
Red Rover
#2 We're taking over
Ah
Easier uttered than accomplished
The North End and the South End may as well be the Hetfields and the McCoys
These fellas
they just don't get on
All the Brugliones yell over one another
#3 Fuck you
The North End built that racket from the ground up
65
#3 South End's been carrying your fucking asses for years
#3 15 percent
In your dreams, asshole
#3 Whoa
Just went up to twenty, fuck stick
Brulione #1 flashes a gun in his waist band
#1 You want some of this, you mutt
Bruglione #1 pulls his weapon
#1 Let's see what you got
They all pull and level at one another
They freeze in place and all yelling ceases as Eunice walks down the middle
Oh, the cliche
Mexican stand off in a Mexican restaurant
Eunice looks deeply at all the men as she turns a slow circle
(') They cut each other to pieces
and nobody walked away
Who knows who fired first
Could have been any one of them
But somebody let it loose
(pointing to men) And duck, duck, duck
Eunice stands before
Brulione #2
(') Goose
They all start shooting as Eunice stands in the crossfire unaffected
Men fall dead and we see the relevance of each thing Eunice did to doctor the scene
,   -- Yakavetta's lost control of the streets
() 66
(') They're fighting over his throne
This was not the work of the Saints
Heads nod agreement
Greenly enters and flashes a file to Eunice
-- Press clamors for the story in the b
g
Eunice and the detectives are in a private spot
Greenly excitedly hands her the file
INTERpol came through
Eunice opens the file
Picture of Crew Cut
Dolly and Duffy read over her shoulder
(') You were right
Five foot five
Gotta be the shooter
Eunice smiles and speaks to Crew Cut's photo
Are you ready for your fifteen minutes, Sweetheart
That ain't all
Short stuff's work visa was signed by a sponsor that doesn't exist and look at the date
Two months after Nine Eleven
Someone maneuvered it through the system using false information during the highest alert in
history
Yakavetta's just a gangster
He ain't got the juice to pull that off
You're darn tootin' he don't
red flagged it like a motherfucker
It's a shit storm
Something stanks like manure
The cops nod
Eunice turns and starts to move away
67
(') We got someplace to be
Let's go
-- Eunice drives
The Detectives look nervous
What is this
Where are we going
It's time to revisit the scene of the crime
'  -- Eunice pulls to a stop
At the sight of the place, the cops turn white as a ghost
All exit the vehicle and walk toward
It's after hours
mean, if you wanted a drink then
37 bodies later and we're finally back where it all began
'ever heard of the southern expression, "We have an elephant in the living room
" She knocks on the door
The cops are mortified
(') Hope you fellas brought some peanuts
Doc opens it and lets them all into
' -- Connor and Murphy are seated at the bar
They turn
The cops are dumbfounded
Duffy turns to Eunice, mystified
You knew all along
What
Ya don't call
Ya don't write
Dolly actually drops to his knees in abject relief
Greenly laughs and plants a kiss on Eunice's cheek
Doc pours shots
Eunice smiles as all her guys hug and make merry
68
' -- Doc smiles from the bar as the group raises for a toast
'm glad we got the band back together
(re: Romeo) even though our new bass player's kind of a retard
They all laugh, cheers and drink
Conversations buzz all around
Eunice chats with the boys as she sips a cosmo
So, where'd you learn ta shoot like that
My Daddy was an old six gun shooter real cowboy
Guess that makes you a cowgirl, eh
Thanks
Saved our asses
Don't mention it
Now, we have a little business to go over before you celebrate in earnest
She hands the INTERpol file to the brothers
This is the guy
That's the guy
He's a Sicilian immigrant, name of Ottilio Panza
Five, five
He's short bastard isn't he
Yes
and well put
He'll be front page news in the morning but we have to assume Yakavetta already knows we've 'd his guy
We can't give him time to 'Plan ' us
69
We're hittin' him tomorrow night
Dat soon enough
Everyone else cuts their conversation and listens
Should be
Where's it gonna happen
The Pru
The Prudential Building
What are you, cracked
Why don't you just do it on center ice at a fucking Bruin's game
Dat's where the man is so dat's where we're goin'
No guts no glory, Green Beans
In fact, we could use a few extra hands
that is if you fellas can still get yer Irish on
Hey,  got balls for days, pally
'm a fucking sack-o-matic
They all chuckle
We're in
(to all) Well, you boys have fun
Connor, Murphy
Escort a lady to the door
They each offer an arm and move her toward the door
'sure you don't wanna hear the plan
'm not tryin' ta brag or nothin' but this one's a real Picasso
Aw, Jesus
70
Hey
School night
Got some homework to do
Besides, 'd like to critique your masterpiece with a fresh eye
She stops at the door and turns
Her face shows concern
What is it
Something ain't right with this whole thing
Panza knew you were in there tonight and he just let it happen
Didn't lift a finger
mean, if he's working for Yakavetta, why would he stand by and just watch all his guys get taken out
That is
interestin'
You think maybe we got another fox in the hen house here
Starting ta look that way
Somebody pushed that visa through
Could have ourselves a gen-u-ine 'Ghost in the Darkness,' here
-- Crew Cut lies on the shop table
He's lost a lot of blood and is in shock
Using gardening utensils, the Old Man removes the bullet
We see his face for the first time
Unremarkable
In Italian
They still live
What if he does not come
What if
Shhhhh
He will come
-- The Irish   (30's) from the first film leads the brothers and Romeo through a basement to a large, steel vault door
71
Expanded my operation, since  saw ya last
Word got out who may or may not have outfitted ya
Turns out ya got quite the underground followin'
He swings the vault open
Romeo and the boys stand in angelic light at the gates of Heaven
Cheesy music as they enter
-- Expanded indeed
Gleaming weapons everywhere
Sheer awe
Something catches Romeo's eye and he moves off
To boys
Please, gentlemen
Preferred customers select from my private reserve
He withdraws two Mahogany boxes
(') If  may make a suggestion
He lifts the lids
In each box is a pair of Desert Eagle
50 cal "Black Outs"
The triangular barrels have been fitted with matching triangular silencers
The boys are mystified
feel like that kid who found the gold ticket in the candy bar in "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory
" Charlie
Yeah
Charlie
(picks up gun) And  want an Oompa Loompa now, Daddy, now
He pulls a few duffel bags
Full accessory packages
'm sure you'll find them useful
Romeo suddenly appears and slaps down a metal box
'll take these
The boys look to him
He sniffles
Red eyes
72
Have you been crying again
Romeo snaps to him, eyes wide in challenge
Yeah
Tears of joy
(to Dealer) How much
You guys are on the house
(to Romeo) Let's see
Romeo withdraws two gold plated
45's, intricately engraved, pearl handles with a Mexican flag
The boys snicker
What
Nothin'
Are you saying  look gay
No
You just hail from a colorful
(to Dealer) You don't know me
You think these make me look gay
Romeo poses
The Dealer shrugs
You look like you might have seen one up close
-- This is a common home at the end of a cul de sac
The Old Man picks up the paper on his front stoop and shuts the door
He opens the paper with shock
big picture of Crew Cut on the front, " ,    ' " He reads frantically
"New evidence discovered at the crime scene

Evidence
He ambles into the house and to a
-- The Old Man moves to Crew Cut's bedside
He sees the rosary about the slumbering man's neck and rips it off
Crew Cut bolts awake
Foolish, arrogant boy
What have you done
He whips Crew Cut with the rosary, until he cowers in the corner, weeping profuse apologies in Italian
-- Monitors show angles of the apartment outside
This small space is equipped for single living
Yakavetta is frazzled, baggy eyed in a robe
Jimmy the Gofer sits quietly as Concezio babbles to himself
That wiley old fox not as clever as we thought
Or maybe he played me from the git
-you think he played me
Uh, Boss
Maybe you aught not to be telling me this stuff
'm just
Concezio smacks him across the face
little sensitivity, huh
You heartless cocksucker
need to vindicate my feelings here
can't tell those goombas outside
They'll serve up my balls over a plate of fucking spaghetti
-- The Capos huddle up
Hushed tones
#4 Fuck that
We got a mutiny on our hands
Every ten cent wanna be with a gun is moving on us all over town
74
#3 Yeah and our fearless leader ain't even come out of his little pussy room yet
With this, the panic room door slides open and Concezio emerges holding a bag
He dumps a bunch of cell phones on the coffee table
want each of you to call your top button man
The best you got
want them all here tonight
We rip this city a new asshole
It's time for us to reconnoiter our strength on the streets
We seize the day starting now
Carpel Tunnel, gentlemen, Carpel Tunnel
All are relieved and words of approval flow
#5 Glad to see you back among the living, Boss
Nearby, Jimmy knocks over a bottle of wine,
Concezio dives back into the panic room
The door slides shut
-- Dolly drives a laundry truck into the Pru's loading dock area
-- Dolly backs it up to the dock and pulls to a stop
He turns
God speed
Romeo, in a laundry uniform, emerges from the back pushing a loaded laundry cart
He enters a
-- At the hall's opposing end, two maintenance workers move toward
Romeo sees and quickly puts his head down
Soon, Romeo and the maintenance men converge
They turn, entering opposing elevators
'  -- As the doors close, Romeo looks into the opposing elevator
The maintenance men are Duffy and Greenly, ball caps, duffel bags
75
As the elevator ascends, Romeo swipes off the laundry, pulls the false top
The brothers pop out in their usual garb
Weapons emerge and they gear up
Romeo looks unsure
What
Nothing
Out with it
What the hell's the matter with ya
Nothing
It's just
this is some heavy shit
Ya did fine at your uncle's place
Yeah, but we're going off a new script here
'm just having a
period of adjustment
You're about to have a period of gettin' yer ass beat
Hey
You two ain't the only ones rollin' with no health insurance
Just let me do my thing
'm absorbing this
This is not the time for you to be absorbin' shit
Now, if ya freeze up when you get in there just point yer gay guns at 'em and fer Christ sakes, at least try ta look cool
thought you were all hot fer dis
Oh, 'm hot
'm fucking red hot
The kid's flamin' like Matt Damon in the Grande Camens
Ding
Romeo has a look of dread
76
This is you
Be on time
Romeo firms himself up as the door opens
'll be there
Romeo exits with the cart
The boys remain
The doors close
Connor and Murphy look at each other
You ready fer dis shit, my dear brother
(cocking
50 cal) Let's do some gratuitous violence
-- demolished environment
The towering windows are blown out, providing a threatening view of the city below
Here, Eunice stands, looking out over the panorama
(to herself) On a sultry Saturday in September the Saints saved seventeen souls
try saying that five times fast
She turns and walks the marble floor which is like a runway, lined with pulverized statues
long table of ravaged food extends
Crime scene personnel toil
Ritualized bodies everywhere
Greenly is by the panic room
He pushes the "talk" button
Come on
There's nothing to be afraid of
It's all over
() He won't come out
He joins Dolly and Duffy who stand on the periphery
Eunice is dead center, absorbing the scene when suddenly,  Agent barrels in with his - #1 - #3
Special Agent Bloom
You are hereby relieved of all obligation to this investigation
77
He holds up his
collective groan from crime scene personnel
(') That's right, kids
This crime scene is now under the full jurisdiction of your beloved federal government
As of now, you will all report to me, Special Agent John Kuntsler
The detectives look to Kuntsler's -men as if squaring off
(') Don't let us interrupt you
Just don't forget to turn over everything you find
We have people standing by ready to take credit for all your hard work
He chuckles as all return to work
Kuntsler turns to Eunice
(') So, how ya doin', Bloomy
Just fine
Cunty
Kuntsler's shit eating grin disappears
He leans in
Hushed tones
Nice little science project you got going with these three goofballs
(re: detectives) You trying to turn them into your own little junior -men
Well, you can put sprinkles on shit, Bloom, but it's still shit
So, you and your Keystone Cops can all go home now and let the professionals handle this
Boy
'd love to hear a gen-u-wine professional's assessment of a crime scene
How 'bout you, detectives
Dolly, Duffy and Greenly chorus the affirmative
Kuntsler looks unsure then phonies up some bravado
Looks around
'kay
Seems pretty obvious
The door was broken down
We've got our point of entry
The assailants fired in this direction
(points toward windows) () 78
(') Explains the windows
The victims were
There are three inaccuracies in what you just said
Number one, David
If the windows were shattered by gunfire coming from inside the room, the glass would have been blown outward
As you can see, most of it is on the inside
Kuntsler looks
Sure enough
His eyes widen
Number two, Dolly
Blood splatters in the direction of the rounds fired
If the assailants discharged toward the windows, the blood would follow suit
Here, the majority of splatter is in the opposing direction
Kuntsler looks
Sure enough
Number three, Duffy
Trick question
There is no number three
He only fucked up twice
() Looks like Bloomy aced her science project
Kuntsler's men look embarrassed
That was just off the
would have seen the blood thing
haven't even had time to
Why don't you let me take a crack at it, John
Won't cost you nuthin'
And just why would  do that
79
Cuz, tonight
mamma's right on time
-- Eunice, alone, saunters before the huge windows which are now intact
Concezio holds court nearby
He is shaved and dressed
His Capos sit around in a loose semi-circle
There are six dangerous looking men standing shoulder to shoulder before them
This evening's topic of discussion
Desperate times require desperate measures
Desperate times require
some, you know, some desperate shit
Starting tonight, every one of you fat fucking slobs is back on the streets and earning your daily bread
chorus of protest
(') Shut the fuck up
(they obey) We got no choice
You motherfuckers better get in touch with your 'inner gangster'
It's time to knock the dust off your ball bats
You break bones
You smash heads
You do whatever you gotta do
Which brings us to the relevance of our new guests
(to button men) Each one of you is to stick to the guy that called you here like glue
You arm yourselves to the teeth, pick your own crews
These bible banging psychos will make an attempt
It's your job to blow their souless hearts out of their chests
It's time to reclaim the streets with an iron fist
80
We gotta take back what's ours with some sincere ironfistery
,    -- Eunice walks the roof with Kuntsler et al in tow
Let's explain the glass, now
Why is most of it inside the room
They halt before a window washing scaffold
(') Here's why
or it will be "why" in a moment
'see, these boys
Well, to put it simply, they tend to get reeeeal
,  -- Creative
It's a creative plan
Duffy, Greenly and the boys descend the tower
Greenly works the controls as Duffy helps the boys tie on harnesses
It's ridiculous
Probably based on some stupid shit ya saw in a movie
And here  am  all tyin' myself up with rope
What is the deal with you and rope
Honestly
It happens ta be a useful thing
The boys start yelling over each other
Duffy turns to Connor
You didn't get this from a movie
did you
Murphy regards his brother, "well

The "Eiger Sanction," Clint Eastwood
And it worked like a fucking charm for him
-- Romeo peeks out a cracked door at a Mafioso guard
(33yrs), a janitor, gagged and duct taped to a hand truck
He has a shiner
Romeo looks through his wallet
'kay Lloyd Cranston of 135 Liberty Lane, apartment 3C
(shows him wallet pic) Lovely wife and kids
How old are they
Nevermind
Here's the situation, Lloyd
Me and a couple of friends of mine are fittin' to do some killin' here tonight
'm talking bullets and blood, custom-wholesale slaughter
You following me, Lloyd-
(Lloyd nods) Good
Now, 've run into a little snag
need to figure out a tag line
You know, something cool to say when it's all over like
"'ll be back," but mine, y'know
need to own this one
think this'll help me get through the quote, unquote event
'm going to take your gag off and you and me are going to riff a little, o'kay
Let's have fun with this
Lloyd nods and Romeo rips off his gag
can't believe you
'm a fucking janitor
What do  know about bullets and slaughter and shit
Not riffing, Lloyd
Now,  need an "Hasta La Vista" line, toute fucking suite and you're gonna help me think of one
-- Eunice stands alone on the end of the scaffold
82
And you can count on it like the
mail
Through rain, sleet, hail or snow
something always seems to go wrong for these poor sons o' guns
The scaffold suddenly stops
What the fuck
(hitting controls) don't know
It just stopped
Well, get it fuckin' goin' again
It won't turn back on
It just died
,
The boys look over the edge
Long way down
How much time
(looks at watch) Sixty Seconds
We gotta go now
What are you talking about
If we're even a few seconds late, Romeo's dead
We gotta go
(looking up) We're down thirteen stories
Eleven more to go
Ball park it
They start counting out lengths of rope by feeding them through their hands and extending their arms out to the sides
One floor, two, three

() The fuckin' Eiger Sanction
-- Lloyd struggles to think
Uh
"Take that, suckers
" Not cool enough
Uh, "Merry Christmas, mother fuckers
" Too sacrilegious
Oh God, uh, how about "Eat it
" What are we at, a buffet, now
Good God, man
'm a
Hang on, you might be onto something with the buffet thing, like with food, y'know
Let's brainstorm on that idea for a minute
-- The boys' ropes are secured and they each pull a Rambo knife
-- Romeo, pushing his cart, jives down the hall toward the guard, singing "La Couca Racha
" The guard puts out a halting hand
84

thing has always amazed me
Eunice stands dead center
Everyone watches

You ever noticed that
It's hard to imagine that just a few hours ago, it was the God damn
coral in here

:    pair of cowboy boots pacing toward
Eunice stands before the looming windows
The immaculate food table stretches before her
She is now in full cowgirl regalia: Leather chaps, rawhide coat, boots, cowboy hat and a pair of gleaming six guns on her hips
With the brim of her hat slung low, Eunice bursts into twirling gunplay with her Colts
She spins them all around, flipping them, catching them, etc
She holsters and stops
(') One thang 'm gon guarantee ya
-- First, Connor jumps off, then Murphy
They fall down and out in slow motion, knives in hand

We gon have us a good time

With their free hand they each pull a
50 cal
85

The Country Western music goes hard core
-: Two bullet holes pierce the windows behind Eunice as she levels her Colts
The mammoth panes shatter but stay in the frame
-: All gangsters bolt upright as their plasma screen explodes with the boys' rounds
Some pull weapons
-- Romeo pulls his
45's and takes out the guard
He kicks in the door and rushes in
-- -: The brothers smash through the glass
They fire as they swing over Eunice's head
-: Eunice leaps onto the table as the boys cut their ropes in mid air with the Rambo knives
The brothers land on their knees
Their momentum carries them, sliding on either side of the table
-: Eunice runs along the table top, crushing food and keeping pace with the boys as all three let the led out
-:   The gangsters and button men return fire in chaos
-: Gangsters are torn up as they are blown over furniture, into walls
Romeo blasts
Slow motion gun battle
-: Yakavetta runs toward his panic room
At the last second, Jimmy the Gofer hip-checks him and dives in
The door slides shut
For a few moments the gun battle rages around Eunice who stands in the center rapid firing at the gangsters
Soon it is over
The brothers slam Concezio to his knees and level to the back of his head
As he begs for his life
And shepherds we shall be, for Thee, my Lord, for Thee
Power hath descended forth from Thy hand, that our feet may swiftly carry out Thy command
() 86
(') So, we shall flow a river forth to Thee and teeming with souls shall it ever be
Romeo watches in awe
(') In Nomine Patris, e Filii, e Spiritus Sancti
Boom
Concezio drops
Romeo's been waiting, guns up and
"Who ordered the whup ass fajita
" What
Whup ass fajita
The brothers turn to each other
That's fuckin' stupid
Eunice whistles in sympathy as she lifts her brim with a Colt
Hold up, now
Everything freezes in place
Eunice shuffles over to Romeo
(') Was that the best you could do
It's just
couldn't think Shhhhhh
(whispers in ear) Ya broke down the door, didn'tcha
Romeo snaps his head toward the entry with inspiration in his eyes
: He breaks down the door
: The brothers shoot Yakavetta
: Romeo, guns up and once more with feeling
Ding dong, motherfucker, diiiing dong
The brothers look at Romeo, then to each other
87
Exactly
You said it
,   -- Eunice stands before the panic room door
She is totally disheveled
She swipes her hair back
And that, gentlemen
is the sound of the fat lady singin'
Everyone stands in shock, Kuntsler, his -men, the detectives even crime scene workers
Greenly whispers to Duffy
Should we
clap or something
Shut up
Suddenly, the panic room door slides open and Jimmy yanks Eunice inside
The door shuts
Everyone rushes toward
Hey
Duffy bangs on the door
Eunice
Oh, shit
Eunice
Greenly slams the talk button
If you hurt her, you piece of shit, will kill you
Do you fucking hear, me
'll kill you
Greenly wheels around, facing Kuntsler
(') Get a hostage negotiator down here and put some stank on it
He could be in there all
touching her and shit
88
-- Eunice has Jimmy pinned face down to the couch, arm twisted behind
'm sorry
'm sorry
wasn't gonna hurt you
You bet your ass you weren't
Just lemme explain
have information, like pertinent information
Ouch
Look,  was listening to you out there and that's, like, exactly what happened
That's what made me think you were the person to talk to
Eunice lets him go and stands
Jimmy sits up
Yakavetta had a partner, didn't he
Jimmy looks scared
Yeah
You saw this fella
Yeah
It was only one time and just for a second but  think  could him
don't know his name, though
Concezio always called him the "Old Man" accept one time when he called him something else, like he fucked up and wasn't supposed ta hear it
What was it
He called him
the Roman
-- Panic room door opens and Eunice emerges with Jimmy in tow
89
(re: Jimmy) Did this little motherfucker
Easy, David
'm fine
'mon gents, we're leaving
This is the Fed's problem, now
Hey
What happened in there
What was said to you, Agent
Jimmy is cuffed by two uniforms
You got him in custody
Ask him yourself
You're the professional
She walks out and the detectives follow
Yeah, professional moron
,   -- There are coroner vans and moderate police activity here as Eunice talks with the detectives who all seem perplexed
got no idea
That's just weird
The Roman
What do you think it means
Feels like our ghost ta me
What do we do now
mean, the brothers ain't goin' nowhere until we get Panza or they do
We've all had enough excitement for one night
Let's sleep on it
-- Crew Cut watches Eunice and the detectives from the dark alley
He has shaved his head bald, giving him a sinister look
90
' -- The place is empty except for Connor and Murphy having a celebratory shot at the bar and cleaning their weapons
When's Romeo returnin' to the "hide out
' Soon as he's done apologizin' to his uncle for wreckin' his restaurant
And he should be sorry
The disrespect
They chuckle as a loud knocking is heard
As Doc peeps through the spy hole and unchains the front doors
Hold your damn horses
He lets Greenly in and locks it behind him
Greenly takes a few steps in, stops and grabs his crotch with both hands
Sack-o-matic,  said
As the boys guffaw,
shotgun blast through the door sends Greenly to the floor with a gaping wound in his back
Crew Cut bursts in with a smoking pig nose shotgun hanging from a shoulder strap
He pulls two Sigs and rapid fires at the brothers
The boys jump over the bar frantically try to reassemble their weapons
Connor and Murphy check their clips
got nothin'
Connor racks his
50 cal and looks in the chamber
One in the hole
They see a shotgun behind the bar
Murphy grabs it
Just as they are about to stand, they hear Doc cry out
Boys
91
They stand and level
Crew Cut has Doc from behind,
9mm to his temple
Thick accent
Put dem down
Throw dem over
The boys do not flinch
Crew Cut pushes his gun into Doc's temple hard
He cries out in pain
(') Throw dem over
The boys toss their guns over the bar
Crew Cut levels toward them, holding Doc in place
He whispers in Doc's ear
(') Brothers, eh
Which one first
This one
(re: Murphy) Dee other, eh
He cocks back his hammer
silence
rings out from the shadows
Crew Cut's hand is hit
He drops, crying out in pain
-: Poppa  emerges from the shadows and moves to Crew Cut with a smoking, silenced Walther pistol in hand
The brothers have just a moment of shock before Greenly chokes up some blood
They jump the bar and rush to him
Jesus Christ
Doc
Call da fuckin' ambulance
As they hold Greenly and beg him to hold on, we move to Poppa standing over Crew Cut
Crew Cut looks up at him in awe
You
Where is the Old Man
Never
Poppa  pulls two
38 revolvers
He snaps the rotary chambers out, puts one bullet in each gun, spins the chambers and snaps them shut
He holds them out to Crew Cut
The boys weep, oblivious to this
92
Just hold on
Hang in there, brother
They're comin'
Greenly struggles to speak
Naw, boys
it's over
Don't worry
proudest day of my life
He seizes violently and dies
The brothers are in anguish
Crew Cut picks a
38 and stands
He and Poppa  level to each other's foreheads
Crew Cut is excited
Poppa  is calm, tranquil
The brothers bolt up in shock
Da
Easy, boys
The boys watch in horror, trying to figure it out
Poppa  motions for his opponent to go first
Crew Cut cocks his hammer back with a "click
" The brother's eyes go wide
What the fuck's he doin'
Crew Cut pulls the trigger, "click
" Connor rushes over and grabs up the shotgun
'm gonna blow this mother fucker's brains out, right now
He cocks it and levels to Crew Cut's head
Connor stops
Poppa  holds out his free hand
Halt
(') Son
Daddy's workin'
Connor lowers the gun
Poppa  pulls back the hammer, "click
" 93
(') Where is he
Crew Cut is unsure of himself
He thinks
Shakes his head
The brothers focus on Poppa 's gun as he tenses on the trigger
() Come on
Crew Cut clenches up, bracing for impact
Poppa  pulls, "click
" The brothers drop to their knees and pray hard
Crew Cut recovers
He smiles, pulls back the hammer
In Italian
Make me famous
"Click
"   Crew Cut's eyes widen in fear
(pulling back hammer) Where
The brothers pray faster as Crew Cut thinks in horror
Crew Cut falls dead
' ,  -- The boys sit at the kitchen table with Poppa
Romeo is propped up on a counter, nearby
Cesar sets out coffee
'm so sorry, boys
This is all my fault
Cesar takes Romeo and leaves, giving them some privacy
What are ya talkin' about, Da
Poppa  strokes the faded "butterfly" tattoo on the back of his hand
Presently
was an immigrant to the
in 1958
was sixteen
came to New York where my father, Jacob MacManus, was a cobbler
() 94
(') Had a little shop and  was to learn the family business
Mafia was everywhere in those days
,   -- Italian  #1-4 talk to  MacManus (43yrs)
In these flashbacks we will refer to young Poppa  as "Noah
"  (16) works in back but watches
Simple extortion
protection money
But your grandfather was proud
can't help ya with dat, lads
Ya got problems with your shoes, 'd be happy to have a look, got fair prices
just
watched
Noah stands shaking as he watches his father beat to death
We fade into later as he holds his father's body, wailing
An Italian kid with a leg brace,  (18yrs), staggers in and hobbles to Noah
Il ochio de dio
We gotta call the polizia, Noah
We gotta call somebody
-- Noah, Louie and a priest are the only ones present at this modest affair
Louie weeps
Noah is emotionless
buried my father, then  buried the men who killed him
Louie, my best friend, helped me
-- Noah holds a knife to Thug #1's throat at a card table
He has #2's head pinned to the table top with a
38 cal
Nearby, Louie holds a large
44 magnum with shaking hands
Seated Thugs #3 and #4 hands raised, are scared as they look at Noah's dead eyes
#3 Come on, kid
It was an accident
We can work dis out
Whatever you want
95
#4 He ain't gonna do shit
(to Thug #3) 'll take two
#3 What da fuck's da matter with you
Can't you see

Help us out here
Put one in the back of his head and you get anything you want
, ,
am his friend
#4 Fuck him and fuck his friend
Deal the cards
He ain't got the balls
Noah shoots Thug #2 then cuts Thug #1's throat
The other Mafiosi scream in horror
Louie kneels and weeps
Noah shoots Thug #3 in the heart and calmly takes aim at Thug #4
He shoots him in the throat and he is blown to the floor, grasping his bleeding neck
Noah rounds the table and takes aim
The man is choking on his own blood
Noah slowly lowers his gun and just watches
-- Louie works on a pair of shoes
They are both a bit older
It started out slowly
Just the ones who were a threat to us
#1 and #2 talk to the stoic Noah
#1 Come on, kid
It's good for you, good for us
We'll move it right out the back of the place
#2 It'll never touch you
You got the word of the Bonnavese family on that
No response from Noah
Dead eyes
96
#1 What's da matter with you, eh
We see Louie peeking through the curtains
() Easy, Noah
easy friend
#2 What are you, stupid or something
He smacks Noah across the face
: -- Noah and Louie bury the bodies of Mafioso #1 and #2
Louie stops and rests
He watches Noah and thinks
-- "" sign in the door
Noah and Louie eat sandwiches
Then one day
Why should we not help others who suffer these Mafia thugs
Noah puts down his sandwich
Louie talks to Noah with passion, m
o
s
and he listens while nodding his head
Then it began
Over dialogue and music we see the following images
Noah cuts out a chalk sketch on a large sheet of shoe leather
Louie helps Noah make a "serious looking" leather vest
Louie hobbles in with a sack
He dumps a bevy of handguns on a table
All different makes
(') Louie would pick the marks and plan everything in detail
Louie draws a map on a note pad and speaks m
o
s
97
Holsters and bullet belts are sewn into the vest
Noah loads the vest with guns as Louie tightens the buckles, stands back and looks Noah over
Ominous
(') And  would go in and do the jobs
mob boss and two body guards wait for an elevator
The doors open
Insides is Noah, dark jacket, English Mac (hat)
He opens his coat, revealing the vest
He draws two weapons, executes them all and calmly hits a button
The doors close
(') would execute, over and over again, those who had taken my father from me
We do a montage of Noah killing Mafiosi in many different ways
(') So it went for years
,  -- We pan to the gaping mouthed brothers
Jesus
So
how'd ya end up inside, Da
Back in '75,  did a hit, came out and the police were waitin' for me
He set me up, 25 to life
Wait
why did he set you up
Can't wait ta ask him
Why didn't ya flip on him
Cut down yer time
The guy fucked ya
couldn't
Why the hell not
98
,     -- picture of a woman with two babies is slammed to the glass
,  -- He'd learned of the birth of my sons
Connor and Murphy hang their heads
Connor looks up
Do you know Louie's full name
Aye
The boys look at each other
' -- Greenly's bagged body is about to be loaded into an ambulance
Eunice stops the EMTs, unzips it and touches his face
She weeps and then crushes into Dolly's chest
He holds her and cries too as Duffy watches in anguish
Eunice's cell rings
She ignores it and Dolly pulls it from her pocket and tosses it to Duffy, never letting go of Eunice
Hello
Alternating coverage
It's me
Put Eunice on
Connor hands the phone to Poppa
-- Eyes still red from crying, Eunice covertly works at a computer
She types
Soon a picture of the Roman comes on up
Eunice looks at his face with trepidation and then
hope they do it slow
you piece of shit
-- :   An old time phone being carried to a rear table
99
We drift by a poker game and young Italian thugs, betting horses and sports
s and smoke are abundant
The phone is set on a back table
(75yrs), an ancient Italian man drinking espresso picks up
Si
It's the Old Man
In Italian, alternating coverage
Hello, old friend
Many years
Are you in need
Yes
am making marinara and alas, have run out of tomatoes
To help an old friend
how many can you spare
Patronazzi looks up
Slowly, many of the young thugs turn
am in good supply of tomatoes
' ,   -- The boys slumber
We push in on their staggered profiles
They simultaneously take a deep breath
,   -- The boys stand in a huge cement access corridor of Fenway Park
It is empty and quiet as a church
man walks toward them
They struggle to see
Presently, we reveal
He passes them
Come on
The game's starting
The brothers follow him
Red Sox emblems are abundant
(') Funny thing about the Red Sox
We never gave up hope, y'know
It's what kept us going all those years
And they did it
They finally fuckin' did it
What are we all gonna do now, huh
They emerge into the stands
Perfect baseball field, empty park

(') lost a lot of money on 'em
But gotta admit
Always felt better
betting the underdogs
Rocco walks on
The boys follow
-- The boys stand on the mound
Rocco walks a circle around it
So, how's things going
The boys drop their heads
(') Yeah
know
It's rough having your faith shaken
The brothers have a pained expression
(') But it happens to all of us
() You know what's always tripped me out
How hundreds of years ago, a bunch of desperate gamblers in leaky ass ships, crossed the ocean blue
They had no clue what was on the other side of it
Took real balls
But they sailed into infinity and made it all the way to the shores of the New fucking World
(re: surroundings) and all they had was their faith
'm always surprised how so many people miss the simple fact that faith
is the reason all of us are even here
You can't underestimate the power of it
Shit, you were the ones that taught me that
Rocco looks to his left and right
Secretly
(') Listen, your my boys so 'm gonna give you some inside
The Sox are gonna do it again this year
The line in Vegas is huge
Put everything you got on it
The boys look to each other
Eyes wide
101
Maybe we should
You're sure, Roc
You know this
Rocco smiles
No
just have faith
And for a second   there, you almost did too
'see,   it's contagious
And if enough people   catch it
look out, baby
roaring cheer arises, shaking the very foundations of the arena
The boys turn in awe
The stands are still empty
-- They jolt awake and look to each other
While the wicked stand confounded
call me with Thy Saints surrounded
,   -- Poppa  stands before Eunice
She hands him an envelope
He lives in York Maine
About 30 minutes from here
Better go quick logged on to an  database to get the info
Homeland Security does internal monitoring now
Only a matter of time before they flag it
Will they know it's you
(she nods) Will you be all right, dear
hear Costa Rica's nice
She looks at him as her eyes well up with tears
(') never thought 'd ask this of another human being but please
kill this man

She is overcome and weeps
Poppa  holds her
It ends taday

-man #2 comes in holding a piece of paper
Anybody word from Bloom, yet
- #2 Nothing
want that little Bayou Bitch in here
Something stinks about this whole thing
- #2 'm having
dump her  and check for flags
See if she's been poking around
-- Poppa , the brothers and Romeo walk kneel at the altar before a memorial to McKinney: Candles, pictures, cards, flowers etc
As they pray, a dozen or so church patrons who are in the pews begin to realize who they are
Our foursome stands and walks back down the aisle
They make eye contact with a few people
When the Saints are gone, the churchgoers gather in the aisle and stare at the front door in disbelief
Excited whisperings
One guy opens his cell phone
Then he thinks
and closes it
-- -man #2 excitedly gives Kuntsler a file
His eyes widen
-- Kuntsler slaps the file down in front of Jimmy who is cuffed to a metal table
He looks at a picture of the Roman
Fear

Into walkie

This is

Walking down the middle of the street, is Poppa : black trench, hat, dark shades
He opens the door and enters the

He moves quietly through the house, stopping at the foot of the stairs
listens
He removes his rosary, hangs it on the banister and moves on, pulling a weapon
-- The Roman, swirls a tomato in a plate of salt and bites into it
Beside him, a horned phonograph plays 40's Jazz
Behind him, we see that the greenhouse is merely an extension of the home
The Roman sits in front of a sunken fire pit at a low flame
Across the pit, an empty chair
Extended before him is a stunning garden, standing in stark contrast to the common house: vines, flowers, cobblestone walks, fountains
The center piece is a Turkish pool with pure white Lillys afloat
Poppa  slowly approaches the Roman from behind
He holsters his weapon and sits
The Roman halts the phonograph
Hello, Louie
Noah
Long pause
We haven't much time
The Roman smiles and gestures the surroundings
104
My garden
She is beautiful, yes
Ah, but you
You are blind to beauty
You are a destroyer, Noah
You know my reasons
You know why did what  did
But do you
You think it was for your father
No
You were born a killer
Death
is in the very blood that runs through your veins
No
Then explain this
The Roman flicks a photo over
It lands in Poppa 's lap
It is the picture we saw earlier
woman holding two babies
(') You were not there to raise them
Not a single day
Yet, how closely they follow in the footsteps of their father
They have inherited your blood, Noah
your anger
Poppa  looks at the photo deeply
-- Outside, back wall of greenhouse
THUGs 1-5 from Patronazzi, hunker down here
They are all armed
#1 (whispered into walkie) Remember, not a scratch on the Old Man
,  -- We look out the bay windows
It is a straight shot down the slanted roof to the roof of the greenhouse
6-8 stand quietly inside
#6 Got it
Wait for the signal

-- gloved hand grabs up Poppa 's rosary
Connor pockets it as he and Murphy silently climb the stairs
/
-- teams load into vans
Squad cars speed through traffic
-- Poppa  tosses the picture into the fire
And you
What are you
The Roman denotes his garden
am a creator
You see
Our very natures stood in opposition as old as the story of the scorpion and the frog
Why
did you sell me out, Louie
You can never understand
25 years
try me
wanted to join with them
They were building an empire
Creating something and  was helping them
used you, Noah, to eliminate their problems, to destroy their competition, to cut out their cancers
earned my place among them
Poppa  looks around
Is this your place among them
Because all  see is a an old man, sitting in a garden
Alas, the scorpion and the frog both lost everything, yes
should have paid more attention to the story
() 106
(') Without you
was no longer useful to them
They cast me out
-- Kuntsler barks into a walkie
The location is to be surrounded and secured upon arrival
Nobody goes in
He suddenly looks out his window to the sky
In the distance, two other copters fly in the same direction
(') Are those fucking news choppers
-- Why the priest, Louie
Why all this
Why, now
Because  knew it would bring you and your sons
You would destroy the Yakavettas and clear my way
This time,  will take what is rightfully mine
Just a little piece, for my old age
After all,  have never been a greedy man
The Roman puts the needle back on the record
Jazz plays

Move
Another Thug opens the bay windows
Thundering music

They rapid fire their huge
50 cals through the wall

-- All following visuals in slo-mo with slamming music
107
Poppa "" stands, throwing open his trench and revealing his leather vest, a six gun rig in the front
The Roman in awe
The double doors crash in and men barrel through as Poppa  turns, pulls two weapons and fires upon them, hitting one
The boys crash through the glass ceiling of the greenhouse on either side of Poppa
They fire as they fall, hit the ground and roll
Romeo bursts into the fray from inside the house, blasting away with his gold
45's, a shotgun hanging on his back
The garden is being torn apart as the brothers, Poppa  and Romeo hit their marks and the hit squad returns fire
The boys dive behind fountains which are then pulverized
The gun battle rages around the Roman who remains seated in the very mouth of madness
His heart breaks as his sanctuary is shredded
Romeo fires as a large rack of wine behind him is torn apart
Murphy fires over a statue and bodies crash into the pool
Connor stands, firing in a Jesus Christ pose
Poppa  drops his empty weapons and pulls two more, laying down a second barrage
Romeo is simultaneously hit in the leg and shoulder
He falls, dropping his
45s
He struggles to fire the shotgun
Poppa  takes one in the chest
Connor is wounded in the shoulder but continues firing
Murphy is hit in the leg but continues firing
The boys and Romeo manage to take out the last of the Thugs, who are blasted into the Turkish pool
It is over
The music fades

Kuntsler exits, shouting orders
Many officers level over their hoods as
piles out and moves toward

The boys hobble to their failing father who is on his knees

Boys
Help me up
They get him to his feet
Poppa  turns to the Roman
He levels a revolver toward the seated man
With his last bit of strength
(') 'll see you in a minute, Louie
Poppa  fires one right between the Roman's eyes
Poppa  crumbles
His sons lay him down
Oh, no, no, no
Poppa  smiles as he looks up at the sun through the blown out glass ceiling
plume of butterflies escape
It's a beautiful day
Aye
It is
it is, Da
He dies
The brothers weep
Nearby, Romeo is slumped and bleeding, on the edge of consciousness
strange calm comes over the brothers as they stand and look to one another
can be heard surrounding the perimeter
The boys look to Romeo
He smiles at them and nods
The brothers turn and walk into the house
The echoed voice of Poppa
And shepherds we shall be

Only God can judge
Oh, save it for group, father
They are bandaged and hooked to machinery
Well,  know this
They certainly don't belong in prison
The boys turn and look out the windows at a group of cons in the yard, staring up at them
Oh,  don't know
Connor and Murphy's faces split with evil grins
They mimic guns at the cons and gesture as if shooting them
