' & Adapted by Craig Pearce & Baz Luhrmann Shooting script October 6, 1995 ribbon of freeway stretching into a blue and pink late afternoon sky
huge dark sedan, windows tinted gold, headlights blazing, powers directly for us
:  heavy, low-slung, pickup truck traveling toward the sedan
: Sky, freeway, the cars closing
: The sedan
: The pickup
Like thunderous, jousting opponents, the cars pass in a deafening cacophony of noise
: The fat face of , yelling at the disappearing sedan
dog of the house of Capulet moves me
He and the pimply-faced front-seat passenger, , explode with laughter
The red-haired driver , keeps his eyes on the road
The truck spirals down an exit ramp and screeches into busy driveway of a large gas station
Attendants immediately run to the truck
Two clean windshields and duco, the third fills the gas tank
Gregory in the back seat is boasting outrageously
dog of that house shall move me to stand
will take the wall of any man or maid of Capulets
Sampson, sarcastically
That shows thee a weak slave
For the weakest goes to the wall
'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall
Therefore, will push Capulet's men from the wall, and thrust his maids to the wall
Benvolio, disgusted, gets out of the car
The quarrel is between our masters
(yelling after him) and us their men
: Benvolio as he heads for the bathroom
:  mother wrangling three little boys out of a station wagon - the smallest kid carries a toy pistol
: Past the mother to - the huge black sedan pulling up outside the gas station mini-mart
The front door of the sedan opens
Shiny black boots - decorated with tiny, silver, cat-shaped spurs - plant themselves on the ground
The boots are joined by two other pairs of well-shod feet
: The spurred boots move out of frame
: The other feet belong to a tough-looking Latin youth  - and his goateed side-kick
Abra and Petruchio enter the mini-mart, as four white-clad girls exit
: The girls as they head for their car
: Past the girls to: Sampson is trying to out boast Gregory
will show myself a tyrant
When have fought with the men  will be civil with the maids,  will cut off their heads
Gregory; mock outrage
The heads of the maids
Sampson leers lecherously at the girls
Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maiden heads, take it in what sense thou wilt
They must take it in sense that feel it
Gregory and Sampson pump up the song on the sound system and sing out at the girls
/ () am a pretty piece of flesh
am a pretty piece of flesh
Me, they shall feel while  am able to stand; am a pretty piece of flesh
The girls, pretending not to notice, get into the car
-
'
: The car pulls away revealing
Abra and Petruchio exiting the mini-mart
: Gregory
: Sampson - Their singing abruptly halts
Here comes of the House of Capulet
Abra and Petruchio stare coldly toward the boys
: Sampson swallowing hard
: Gregory; eyes locked to the Capulets
With fake bravado he nudges Sampson
Quarrel  will back thee
: Sampson trying to quell his rising panic
Let us take the law of our sides
Let them begin
:
Gregory and Sampson jump
: It was the garage attendant slamming the hood
Gregory and Sampson are mortally embarrassed
-
Abra and Petruchio laugh contemptuously and move to their : : The mother and kids exiting the mini-mart
: To
Sampson furiously tries to save face
will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them if they bear it
Sampson quickly bites his thumb toward Abra's back as he gets into the sedan
Abra's eyes flick to the rear view mirror
: The rear view mirror; Sampson biting his thumb
Suddenly, a blood curdling screech of tires - the sedan, rubber burning, reverses full speed toward Sampson and Gregory
The mother in the station wagon brakes to avoid collision - a sports car shunts into her vehicle
Mother and children scream
Attendants scatter
The Capulet car shudders to a halt inches from the truck, blocking its path
:  scurry of limbs scrabbling across seats and reaching for door handles; Abra hauls Sampson from the truck
Gregory leaps out, Petruchio covers him
Abra slams Sampson against the side of the vehicle - then, goading him to go for his gun, screams: Do you bite your thumb at us, sir
Sampson's shaking hand hovers - ready to draw
do bite my thumb, sir
: The panicked mother in the station wagon
She motions her children to the floor
Customers run for cover
: Abra: An hysterical rage; he shrieks: Do you bite you thumb at us, sir
(sweating, murmurs to Gregory) Is the law on our side if  say "Ay"
No
: The black cowboy boots, trousers down around them
The sound of a toilet flushing
: The next cubicle, the door opens revealing Benvolio
: Sampson, still sweating
No, sir,  do not bite my thumb at you, sir - but  do bite my thumb, sir
: Gregory; a ridiculous inquiry
Do you quarrel, sir
: Abra; a dangerous smile
Quarrel sir, no sir
: Sampson; unconvincing bravado
But if you do, sir,  am for you serve as good a man as you
: Abra; a lethal question
No better
: Sampson, trapped
Well sir
: Inside the station wagon
The mother does not notice her five year old aiming a toy gun toward the boys
: Gregory's
: Benvolio emerging from the bathroom - he whispers maniacally
Here comes our kinsman
Say better
: Sampson; he screams: ,
: Abra demonically roars: : Benvolio
Terror stricken, he sees the boys
: Abra shrieks: : Four hands reaching for guns
: To Benvolio - weapon outstretched he screams: Part, fools
You know not what you do
;      along the barrel of Benvolio's gun; the engraved gun type reads: 'Sword 9mm series ' : Benvolio
He screams in desperation: Put up your swords
Gregory, Sampson, Abra, and Petruchio freeze
moment - then from behind, the unmistakable sound of a gun being cocked
: The black cowboy boots
: To find the dark cold eyes and feline smile, of the wearer of the boots
His name is ; a cigarette is clenched between his teeth and his gun is aimed at Benvolio's head
What, art thou drawn amoung these heartless hinds
Turn thee Benvolio
Benvolio, a choked explanation: do but keep the peace
mocking smile
Peace
hate the word As  hate hell, all Montagues, and
: Tybalt's finger squeezing the trigger
Suddenly we hear firing from Tybalt's blind side
Tybalt redirects his weapon, cracking off a single shot at the surprise attacker
/
It is the five year old from the station wagon
The bullet smacks the toy gun from the child's hand, shattering the wagon's window
Mother and children scream
panicked Benvolio falls back, accidentally his gun fires - the bullet whistles past Tybalt's head
Tybalt combat rolls, and using a screaming car load of girls as cover, returns two quick shots, narrowly missing Benvolio
The gas station attendant hits a button and heavy metal screens slam down
: Gregory firing - a bullet rips through Abra's arm
Petruchio dives for cover; Gregory and Sampson leap into Benvolio's truck
Rubber burns as they smash past the Capulet vehicle
: Tybalt taking aim
-
His first shot plugs the fuel tank, the second a tire
Out of control and spewing gasoline the Montague truck careens across the highway and through the glass front of a supermarket
Gregory and Sampson throw themselves from the truck moments before
: The gas tank erupts into an almighty fireball
The screen fills with flame: the following images combust in front of us: -  -
: Citizens run in the streets
Looters raid shops near the supermarket - security guards return fire
table of dark suited men and their wives
: The powerful 60 year old face of
Seated next to him is his much younger wife
: Windows explode in a tidal wave of glass
Diners take cover
Capulet moves fearlessly toward the window
(to a waiter) Give me my long sword
: The word  fills the screen
: We see the word is the number plate of a large black limousine
The limousine is stuck in the traffic snarl - bullets bounce off its bullet proof windshield
'
, a 60 year old red-faced bulldog of a man, bursts from the back of the limousine
What noise is this
As Ted draws an enormous pearl handed revolver, , his conservatively dressed wife, tries to restrain him
Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe
(shrugging her off) Hold me not, let me go
Crouched behind a truck, Benvolio shakily tries to re-load
: The barrel of Tybalt's gun enters frame and presses into Benvolio's forehead
Tybalt whispers sweetly
Look upon thy death, Benvolio
: Tybalt's finger on the trigger
Benvolio screams a scream of mortal horror
Tybalt is blinded by a burning shaft of light magnificently powerful helicopter gunship hovers above him
command booms from the chopper's public address system
(over ) Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace, Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground
: The steely gray eyes of  , chief of the Verona Beach Police Department
He lifts the microphone and repeats the command
Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground
Tybalt looks up to the chopper
Patrol cars screech to a halt
An almighty orchestral chord
-
:  trail of devastation winds up through grid-locked traffic to the burning supermarket
In the distance looms an enormous statue of Christ flanked by two glass towers
We push toward the towers
One is neon-crowned , the other,
We hear: Two households, both alike in dignity
In fair Verona, where we lay our From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes pair of star crossed lovers take their life
Whose misadventured piteous Doth with their death bury their parents strife
dark chord
swarm of helicopters thunder into frame
We see compressed, time-lapsed, images of their journey
:  coat of arms that labels a large tower - the emblem reads; "Verona Beach Police Department: In God We Trust"
: '
: Captain Prince's grim features
He eyes Capulet and Montague
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy By thee, old Capulet, and Montague, Have thrice disturbed the quiet of our streets
Capulet's lawyer tries to intervene
My noble Prince  can
Captain Prince overriding, slams the desk
If ever you disturb our streets again, Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace
Hold on Captain Prince's determined gaze
majestic sunrise; Ted Montague's limousine sulks through deserted streets
In the distance, Jesus looks out over the now peaceful city
'
Ted Montague, his wife Caroline, and nephew Benvolio ride in uncomfortable silence
Caroline finally speaks her anger
where is Romeo
Saw you him today
(pointedly to Montague) Right glad  am he was not at this fray
Montague snorts derisively and stares out the window
Embarrassed, Benvolio tries to be of assistance
Madam, underneath The Grove of So early walking did  see your son
Ted Montague speaks with contempt
Many a morning hath he there been With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew
Caroline struggles to contain her emotion
Away from light steals home my heavy son And private in his chamber pens himself, Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out And makes himself an artificial night
Montague barks into the car intercom
Westward from this city side
The limousine -turns heading west
To the melancholic strains of Mozart's "Serenade for Winds", we see a blond nineteen year old boy sitting alone on an empty beach
: The boy,
Looking out over the ocean he sucks on the last of a cigarette and then writes intensely in a small worn note book
We hear his voice over
(/) Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs; Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes; Being vexed, a sea nourished with lovers' tears
What is it else
madness most discreet, choking gall and a preserving sweet
'
The limo is parked in a cross street that runs down to the beach
Opposite the limo, young diehard clubbers, faded drag queens and street people, hang outside a dilapidated nightclub broken neon sign reads: "The Grove of Sick Amore
" Ted, Caroline and Benvolio sit watching the silhouette of Romeo on the beach
Black and portentous must this humour prove Unless good counsel may the cause remove
: From the limousine
Romeo rises and listlessly makes his way up the beach - seeing his father's car he turns and heads for the path that hugs the beach front
'
So please you step aside
'll know his grievance or be much denied
Benvolio clambers out of the limo
: Montague, an encouraging smile
Come Madam
Let's away
The limousine pulls away and Benvolio heads after Romeo
He pauses
deck at the rear of "Sick Amore" sprawls onto the beach
At the base of the deck, Benvolio can see Romeo squatting in discussion with an old drunk
Benvolio approaches with a not very convincing casualness
Good morrow, cousin
Romeo turns
Sore, red, unfriendly eyes squint back at Benvolio
Is the day so young
But new struck, Coz
Romeo rises, Benvolio follows
Ay me
Sad hours seem long
Romeo stops as if taking in Benvolio for the first time
(
) Was that my father that went hence so fast
() It was
Benvolio chases Romeo down the path which divides the beach from a string of cheap souvenir shops and sleazy bars
What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours
Not having that which having makes them short
In love
Out
Of love
Out of her favor where  am in love
Alas that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannical and rough in proof
Alas that love, whose view
Romeo is halted by the sight of last night's disturbance displayed on a small  screen in an outdoor bar
(
) What fray was here
Benvolio starts to reply
(
) () Yet tell me not, for  have heard it all
Here's much to do with hate, but more with love
Romeo turns the corner away from the beach
He strides along the sidewalk raging
(
) Why then,  brawling love,  loving hate, anything, of nothing first create
heavy lightness, serious vanity, Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms, Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health, Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is
Romeo screams at a huge bouncer who lounges in the doorway of a sex club
(
) This love feel , that feel no love in this
The bouncer's hand moves to his gun
Romeo, ignoring him, turns on Benvolio
mocking laughter through tears: (
) Dost thou not laugh
Benvolio, nervously eyeing the bouncer, shepherds Romeo out of danger
No, coz,  rather weep
Romeo smiles
Farewell, my coz
Romeo, breaking into a jog, leaves Benvolio behind
Benvolio pursues him down the street
'
: The sleeping face of a fourteen year old boy - : Balthasar sleeps on the hood of a magnificent silver car
Three or four kids doze on the sidewalk
As Romeo approaches, they jump up and begin vigorously polishing the already gleaming car
Balthasar wakes
He springs off the hood, chases the kids away, then, producing a huge bunch of keys, opens the car door for Romeo
Benvolio intercepts Romeo at the car
Tell me in sadness, who is it that you love
In sadness, cousin,  do love
a woman
aimed so near when  supposed you loved
Romeo leans against the car
right good marksman; and she's fair  love
Romeo pulls his shirt down to reveal a small shoulder tattoo
: The tattooed word;
Rosaline
(he is impressed) right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit
She'll not be hit with Cupid's arrow
She hath Dian's wit, And in strong proof of chastity lives well armed
Benvolio can't believe it
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste
She hath; and in that sparing makes huge waste
Benvolio - a plan
Be ruled by me; forget to think of her
, teach me how  should forget to think
Benvolio indicates one of the working girls already strutting the foot path
By giving liberty unto thine eyes
Examine other beauties
Romeo laughs dismissively
He throws the kids a few coins and slides into the drivers seat
Balthasar jumps in back
Farewell
Thou canst not teach me to forget
'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt
Benvolio leaps into the passenger seat of the moving vehicle
An orchestral fanfare
: Past monstrous letters that read  and in through a window to discover Fulgencio Capulet
He stares out the window toward the other tallest building in Verona; the one crested with the word
But Montague is bound as well as , In penalty alike; Capulet turns: on the other side of his desk sits ; a square-jawed young man in a red cashmere sweater
Tea has been served from an exquisite silver tea service
(
) And 'tis not hard,  think, for me so old as we to keep the peace
Dave smiles obligingly
Of honorable reckoning are you both, And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long
An awkward pause: Dave sips tea, then, with a deep breath
(
) But now, my lord, what say you to my suit
Capulet considers the framed photograph on his desk
But saying o'er what  have said ; My child is yet a stranger in the ; Let two more summers wither in their pride, Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride
Dave is politely insistent
Younger than she are happy mothers made
(checking him hard) And too soon marred are those so early made
Earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she; She is the hopeful lady of my earth
Capulet rounds the desk and places a fatherly hand on Dave's shoulder
(
) But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart
My will to her consent is but a part, And she agreed, within her scope of Lies my consent and fair according voice
This night  hold an old Accustomed feast
Capulet leans close
(
) At my poor house, look to behold this night, Fresh female buds that make dark heaven light
Hear all; all see, And like her most whose merit most shall be
Capulet smiles knowingly
Dave seems encouraged
(
) (a hearty slap) Come go with me
Capulet excitedly ushers Dave from the office
Dim, smoke filled
Benvolio and Romeo play pool
(chalking his cue) Take thou some new infection to thy eye
He lines up the six ball top pocket
(
) And the rank poison of the old will die
hopeless shot that slams the eight ball toward the side pocket
Romeo stops it with his hand and hurls it against the other balls
Why, Romeo, art thou mad
Romeo sinks the other balls with his hands
Not mad, but bound more than a madman is; Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Romeo stalks away from the table
(
) Whipped and tormented
He stops at the gun check, rummaging in his pocket
Good day, good fellow
crusty old man looks up from the small television
His entire face a tattooed shooting target, the bullseye between his eyes
The old man points to the sign that reads: "No ticket no gun
" Romeo finally produces a ticket
Crusty the Target goes out back
Romeo's attention is caught by the television
:
An ostentatious woman and her over groomed partner Rich, hosts what looks to be a kind of Entertainment Tonight show
The graphic behind them reads "Solemnity Nights" with Susan Santandiago and Rich Ranchidis
Susan speaks conspiratorially to camera
Now 'll tell you without asking
The great Rich Capulet, holds an old accustomed feast; Rich chimes in: fair Assembly
Pray you sir can you read
list of names begins to scroll across the screen
Rich reads them off
Signor Placentio and his wife and daughters, Signor Martino, the Lady Widow Of Utruvio and her lovely nieces, Rosaline and Livia
: Benvolio, he leans into Romeo
At this same ancient feast of ' Sups the fair Rosaline; whom thou so loves, With all the admired beauties of Verona
Go thither, and with unattained eye Compare her face with some that shall show, And  will make thee think thy swan a crow
One fairer than my love
Crusty returns
He hands the boys their guns
(
) The all-seeing sun Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun
:
If you be not of the house of Montagues, Come and crush a cup of wine
Rest you merry
: Romeo, he considers
'll go along, no such sight to be shown
But to rejoice in splendour of mine own
The boys move off
:
An aerial shot of a magnificent island estate
An Italianate wonder of Florentine architecture
Armed guards patrol the grounds
The telecaption reads "Capulet Mansion
" The file tape loses its television quality
We sweep down through manicured gardens, where workers prepare decorations for tonight's celebrations, and into the house
The music darkens and we hear the desperate calling of a girl's name
-
:  long deserted corridor
-
: An echoey Chinoiserie style drawing room
: The still, serene, submerged features of a beautiful young girl
Dark floating hair gently frames the face
Heavy liquid eyes stare up through the water
We hear, though faintly, the calling: With a rush  surfaces
As she gulps air, we realise that she is in fact, in a bath
We hear the calling loudly again
Juliet listens
For a moment she is very still, then she closes her eyes and slides back beneath the surface of the water
Gothic, unfriendly environment heavy with religious iconography
The entrance hall is crowded with workers and servants preparing for tonight's party
Gloria Capulet fiddles with a short black wig in the hallway mirror
She is attired in full Cleopatra costume
Dissatisfied with the wig, she rips it from her head and calls maniacally
Gloria is met by the , a fat, grandmotherly Hispanic woman
(
) Nurse, where's my daughter
Call her forth to me
bade her come
God forbid
Where's this girl
Juliet
: The top of the stairs
As if from nowhere, Juliet has appeared
She wears a bathrobe and her hair is wet
() Madam,  am here
What is you will
Gloria, startled, sweeps up the stairs and shuffles her daughter toward a doorway
Nurse, give leave awhile, we must talk in secret
'
Gloria shepherds Juliet into her opulent dressing room and closes the door
She circles with nervous vexation searching for words, stops, then suddenly opens the door and yells out to the Nurse
(
) Nurse, come back again
have remembered me, thou's hear our counsel
The Nurse enters
Gloria, still refusing eye contact, checks her appearance once more in the mirror
She takes a hairbrush and, feigning pleasantness, intensely brushes her hair
(
) Nurse, thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age
(to Juliet) Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er  nursed
The hair brush clatters onto the dresser
moment of tense silence
Gloria grips herself and pours a sherry
Back still turned, she speaks to her daughter
By my count,  was your mother much upon these years That you are now a maid
nembutal twists like a pin in the corner of Gloria's mouth
She slugs it down with the sherry and turns abruptly to face Juliet
(
) Thus then in brief, the valiant Paris seeks you for his love
: Juliet; an uncomprehending stare
The Nurse, caught off guard, tries to buoy the situation
man, young lady
Lady, such a As all the world - why, he's a man of wax
The medication takes immediate effect upon Gloria
She joins Juliet on the couch and coos in Paris's favour
Verona's summer hath not such a flower
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower
This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face And find delight writ there with beauty's pen
This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him only lacks a cover
So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less
Gloria probes Juliet's thoughts
Can you like of Paris' love
Juliet, adept at negotiating her mother's strange moods, chooses her words precisely
'll look to like, if looking liking move, But no more deep will  endart mine eye, Than your consent gives strength to make it fly
the chauffeur enters
Madam
The guests are come
(checks the mirror) We follow thee
She exits, Nurse in tow
: Juliet stares out the windows and across the water
Suddenly the Nurse's face leers into shot
She whispers enthusiastically into Juliet's ear
Go girl, seek happy nights to happy days
: Juliet's face
/
: Aerial shot of Capulet Mansion
We time lapse from late afternoon to night; fairy lights illuminate, guests appear, music swells, and a single incandescent flare, explodes pink against the inky sky
: Romeo: his face glows pink
He is sitting on the grubby shoreline of Verona Bay dressed as a boy King Arthur, with fake chain mail and sword
Romeo watches the dying flare sink into the bay
The sound of the party drifts across the water
Balthasar, dressed as Frankenstein's monster, touches a lighter to a large bong and Romeo inhales smoke
Behind them, Benvolio, drunk and dressed as a pizza, is yelling at Gregory, who, dressed as a Viking, is trying to cut slices off his pizza costume
Sampson, also dressed as a Viking, sits in the back of a car
One arm is bandaged and he swigs from a bottle
Suddenly the darkness is slashed by headlights
reckless sports car speeds toward the boys
Stereo screaming, the car skids to a halt
: Music blares from the sound system
silver stilettoed foot emerges from the car and plants itself firmly in the dirt
: The boys, eyes wide with amazement
: Another stiletto follows the first
Guitar groans
: Slowly up a shapely pair of black stockinged legs, past a hint of garter belt to a black sequined mini-skirt and up over a muscular dark skinned stomach and tiny sequined bra top, to discover: the 21 year old male, African American face of
: The boys
Recovering from the initial shock, they laugh and cat-call raucously
: Mercutio
He roughly jams a short black wig onto his head and yells above the music
Strike drum
Mercutio magically produces invitations from somewhere within his mini-skirt and dances down the beach to the boys
Aggressively bumping and grinding, Mercutio distributes the invitations
Reaching Romeo, he declares: We'll on without apology
Romeo lets the invitation fall to the sand
am not for this ambling
Being but heavy,  will bear the light
Romeo pulls on the bong once more
Suddenly, Mercutio is upon Romeo
Hauling him to his feet, he waltzes him through the sand
Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance
Romeo pushes Mercutio away
Not , believe me
You have dancing shoes With nimble soles
have a soul of lead
Mercutio in mock sympathy
Too great oppression for a tender thing
Is love a tender thing
It is too rough, too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn
Romeo lies staring up at the stars
If love be rough with you, be rough with love
Mercutio jumps on Romeo
(
) Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down
Romeo fights Mercutio off
Under love's heavy burden do  sink
: Benvolio, impatiently honking the horn
Every man betake him to his legs
Mercutio heads Romeo toward the car
Come, we burn daylight, ho
Romeo pulls away
But 'tis no wit to go
Mercutio turns, exasperated
Why, may one ask
dreamt a dream tonight
And so did
Well, what was yours
That dreamers often lie
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true
Mercutio produces a tiny gold pill case
, then  see Queen Mab hath been with you
She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate On the forefinger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep
Tantalisingly, he passes the case beneath Romeo's nose
(
) Her chariot is an empty hazelnut, Her wagoner a small gray-coated gnat
With a conjurer's dexterity Mercutio extracts a small, gray pill
(
) And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; He palms the pills
It reappears from behind Romeo's ear
(
) 'er lawyers' fingers who straight dream on fees; 'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream, Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are
The pill box glints in the moonlight
(
) Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck; And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats
And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two And sleeps again
Mercutio now intensely angry: (
) This is that very Mab That plaits the manes of horses in the night And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs He screams into the night
(
) This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage
This is she, this is she
: Mercutio
He breaks off
There is a strange stillness amongst the group
Romeo goes to his friend
Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace
Thou talkest of nothing
Mercutio meets Romeo's gaze
True,  talk of dreams; Which are the children of an idle brain, Begot of nothing but vain fantasy
Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind, who woos Even now the frozen bosom of the And, being angered, puffs away from Turning his attention to the dew- dropping south
: Benvolio in the car
The alcohol has caught up with him and he looks a little queasy
This wind you talk of blows us from : Supper is done and we shall come too late
Romeo looks toward the distant city
fear, too early, for my mind Some consequence yet hanging in the Shall bitterly begin his fearful With this night's revels, and expire the term Of a despised life closed in my breast, By some vile forfeit of untimely death
: The water turns golden as fireworks explode across the bay
Romeo smiles
(
) But he that hath the steerage of my Direct my sail
He takes the pill and drops it into his mouth
(
) On, lusty gentlemen
With the rush of a mind altering cocktail, we   on Romeo's eyes; they shimmer with the shooting star reflection of exploding fireworks - a bending Eastern chord, we launch into Donna Summer's ' Feel Love', sung by the vocalist from Soundgarden with orchestration by 'Deconstruction' and sitar by Ravi Shankar
'  -
: From Romeo's eyes
He is lying in the passenger seat of Mercutio's convertible as it rockets along the freeway
The camera is directly above Romeo
He stares up at the fireworks that reflect in the windshield
The car and freeway begin to rotate and the camera follows
We feel that the car is now travelling upside-down
The camera sways through a brilliant explosion of fireworks that fill the screen with a zillion pixilating, colored dots of fire
'  -
: To discover the glittering dots of fire refracting from the sparkling domed roof of the magnificently ornate Capulet Ballroom
The camera swoops down over bizarrely costumed revellers cavorting to a driving Latin big band
The camera partners with a drugged Mercutio and Benvolio who shamelessly caper with each other in a mock antic adagio
: Romeo gazing blankly at the dance floor
: Mercutio
He sweeps up a thirty-something sophisticate and twirls her in Romeo's direction
Everyman betake him to his legs
Romeo moves off through the crowd
: '
: Contorted images of costumed guests eat, drink and laugh in a grotesque collision of Yves Saint Laurent cocktail party and Bacchanalian romp
Suddenly a large arm coils around Romeo's neck
:  seriously intoxicated Fulgencio Capulet; his puffy red face squeezes against Romeo's
Ah,  have seen the day that Tell a whispering tale in a fair ladies ear
Such as would please
Capulet screams above the music: (
) Come musicians play
Blood drums in Romeo's ears
Breaking free from Capulet's grasp as he pushes through the crowd toward the bathroom
Silent, underwater shot
Romeo's tranquil features submerged in a basin of water
With a gasp, Romeo rises
moment
His breathing calms
Then, smoothing water into his hair, he gazes into the bathroom mirror
He turns: The entire wall opposite the mirror, is a magnificent salt- water fish tank
Romeo, drawn by it's submarine beauty, leans against the fish tank
Applause echoes faintly through the bathroom speakers
As the applause dies, a dark-haired Latina Diva takes the spotlight
The band ease into the opening bars of a love ballad
As the music swells, Romeo watches a moustached catfish glide past a medieval castle
Suddenly, Romeo pulls away
Peering back at him through the castle is a pair of exquisitely beautiful angelic eyes
The Diva's first pure, achingly beautiful notes soar
Confused, Romeo looks again
There is no mistake - it is a girl
Through a shimmering curtain of ribbon weed, two dark wide eyes, a childish nose and sumptuous full lips
Romeo pushes his face closer to the glass
The other face snaps abruptly away
: Juliet, dressed as an angel, on the other side of the tank
We now realise that the girls' powder room and the boys' bathroom are divided by this watery wonder world
Juliet warily moves closer to the glass
Romeo leans his face against the glass
The love ballad builds
: From Romeo's profile, in through the water, and
out the other side, to find Juliet in profile, peering into the tank
Romeo presses his nose lightly against the glass
Juliet; a tiny smile
Suddenly,
The door slams open
Juliet turns, startled
It is the Nurse
Juliet, your mother calls
The Nurse bustles Juliet out the door
Juliet looks over her shoulder at the mystery boy
Romeo, now without his mask, slams out of the bathroom - Juliet and the Nurse have disappeared into the crowd
: Juliet being dragged along by the Nurse
She glances back toward the mystery boy, but he is gone
Juliet and the Nurse rejoin Dave Paris, who is dressed as an astronaut, and Gloria, at the side of the dance floor
Dave, irresistible smile, extends his hand to Juliet
Will you now deny to dance
Juliet looks to Dave, desperately searching for a reason to decline
Gloria, brushing aside her silly daughter's protests, slugs the last of her champagne and corrals them onto the dance floor
(whispering to Juliet) man, young lady, such a man
As Juliet is dragged onto the floor her eyes furtively search for the boy
: Romeo in the crowd
Desperate to find the girl, he roughly shunts aside a reveller dressed as Lucifer, Prince of Darkness
: Lucifer
He removes his mask: it is Tybalt
He turns to Abra, who's dressed as a demon
What, dares the slave come hither to fleer and scorn at our solemnity
Now by the stock and honor of my To strike him dead  hold it not a sin
Tybalt moves off aggressively, but is halted as Capulet slams a hand into his chest
Why how now kinsman, wherefore storm you so
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo
Montague, our foe
Capulet peers across the ballroom
Young Romeo is it
'Tis he
Content thee gentle coz, let him alone
would not for the wealth of all this town Here in my house do him disparagement
Therefore be patient; take no note of him
Tybalt can't believe it
'll not endure him
: Capulet, exploding with rage
He shall be endured
(slapping Tybalt viciously) What, goodman boy
say he shall
Go to
Capulet violently shoves Tybalt to the ground
You'll make a mutiny among my guests
middle aged couple look on shocked - Capulet waves to them : What
Cheerly my hearts
Capulet snorts at Tybalt in disgust
You'll not endure him
Am  the master here or you
Go to
Smoothing his hair into place, Capulet turns back into the ballroom
: Tybalt choking back tears of rage
: Romeo moving through the crowd
For a moment the crush clears and he spies the Angel on the dance floor
: Romeo whispers: Did my heart love till now
Forswear it, sight
For  ne'er saw true beauty till this night
Romeo begins to circumnavigate the dance floor in an attempt to get closer to Juliet
: Dave slow dancing with Juliet
Juliet's eyes search the room for the boy
: Romeo
: Juliet
Their eyes connect
Juliet looks quickly back to Dave who, oblivious, returns his most devastating smile
: The songstress, her voice soars
: Juliet
Unable to look away from the boy, she stares over Dave's shoulder
: Romeo
Ignoring the danger, he continues to move toward the Angel
With the Diva's spiralling final notes, the ballad concludes
complete black out
As the crowd break into wild applause, Juliet's eyes search the darkness, but the boy is gone
The crowd cheers and screams its applause
An avalanche of balloons, tinsel and confetti rains down from the roof; swathes of red silk drop from the ceiling and the space is transformed
: Juliet, searching for the boy
Suddenly:  gasp, Juliet's eyes widen, shocked
In the dark, a hand has shot out from the drape curtaining off the stage and clasped hers
Juliet barely dares breathe
She glances furtively to Dave Paris - he watches the stage
Slowly Juliet turns toward the hand; there through a break in the curtain she can see eye, cheek and lips of the mystery boy
As the Diva reprises the chorus, Romeo gently pulls Juliet behind the curtain
Concealed from the party by the red velvet drape, hands still clasped, the teenagers are so close their bodies almost touch
If  profane with my unworthiest This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this
My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss
Romeo moves his lips toward Juliet's
She stops him
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this
For saints have hands that pilgrim's hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too
(a gentle scolding) Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer
, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do, They pray: grant thou, lest faith turn to despair
Saints do not move, though grant for prayer's sake
Then move not while my prayer's effect  take
He kisses her
(
) Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purged
Then have my lips the sin that they have took
Sin from my lips
trespass sweetly urged
Give me my sin again
He kisses her
You kiss by th' book
They kiss again
Suddenly a harsh light falls across the entwined couple
They break apart - Nurse has pulled open the curtain and stands eyeing them severely
Madam, your mother craves a word with you
We see that the party is breaking up
But for groups of die-hard revellers, the room is nearly empty
(
) Come, let's away
She takes firm control of her charge
Juliet furtively motions for the startled Romeo not to follow as he trails them across the room
: '
: The Nurse and Juliet reach the door, but instead of leaving, they turn and ascend the staircase that arcs around to the mezzanine level
They join a vexed Gloria Capulet who clings to a patient Dave Paris
Inaudible words are exchanged
Juliet flickers her eyes nervously to Romeo
: Romeo
He halts at the foot of the stairs unsure
: Gloria
Catching Juliet's interest in the boy, she indicates to her daughter to ' '
: Romeo; a dawning realisation
(under his breath) Is she a Capulet
: Juliet
She stops and turns back
: Romeo, comprehending the reality of who she is
: Juliet
The Nurse whispers in her ear
His name is Romeo, and a Montague, The only son of your great enemy
An orchestral treatment of Joy Division's "Love will tear us Apart" swells; : Juliet
Like a cloud passing across the sun, a dark coldness descends upon her
: Mercutio
He throws himself upon the shell shocked Romeo
Away, begone, the sport is at its best
Mercutio shuttles Romeo toward the door
Ay so  fear, covert glance over his shoulder
(
) The more is my unrest
Mercutio bundles Romeo through the front door and down the stairs to the waiting getaway car
-    -
: Juliet
Manoeuvred by the Nurse up the stairs, she breaks away and rushes to a tiny, windowed alcove
-
: Mercutio's convertible and its noisy confederacy joining the line of departing limos
huge sign combusts into blinding fireworks that write in giant words "
" As the convertible passes beneath the blazing words, Romeo turns
Through a deluge of falling sparks, he glimpses the mystery girl high up in the tower
-
: Juliet leaning out of the tower window
Brilliant sparkles light in her eyes
: We hear her secret whisper: My only love, sprung from my only hate
Too early seen unknown, and known too late
Prodigious birth of love it is to me -
: '
: In slow motion Romeo, through the falling curtain of fiery embers
(
)(/) That  must love a loathed enemy
-
Warm wind blows the smoke from the expended fireworks
Juliet closes the window and leans against the glass
: The side of the building past revellers who don't know when to leave
Standing in the front doorway is someone else who cannot take their eyes off the departing Romeo
It is Tybalt
The music darkens as we push through the smoky wind
will withdraw
But this intrusion shall, Now seeming sweet, convert to bitterest gall
'
Caught in the jam of departing vehicles, Mercutio's car crawls along the bridge that links Capulet island with the mainland
The boys sing along raucously with the radio
" am a pretty piece of flesh, am a pretty piece of flesh
" : On Romeo, he whispers: Can  go forward when my heart is here
Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out
Romeo leaps from the car
Benvolio yells after him
Romeo
Cousin Romeo
Romeo
Romeo runs back along the bridge toward the estate
At the gates, armed guards supervise the exodus of vehicles
Romeo uses the traffic to shield himself from view
Romeo leaps from the bridge and into the shadows at the base of the high stone wall that borders the compound
Mercutio's car prowls back along the bridge
The last guests have departed and the gates are swinging shut
The convertible halts in front of them
He ran this way
Call, good Mercutio
Nay, 'll conjure too
Mercutio leaps from the car
He postures like a magician in a low-budget variety special
The boys cheer him on
Romeo
Humours
Madman
Passion
Lover
conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie, That in thy likeness thou appear to us
: Romeo's fake chain mail shirt tangled in the barbed wire at the top of the wall
: Romeo, now on the other side of the wall, pulls up his undershirt and gingerly inspects the cuts inflicted by the wire
Mercutio's cavorting echoes from the bridge
Romeo smiles ironically
He jests at scars that never felt a wound
Romeo moves off through the darkened grounds of Capulet estate
The boys laugh hysterically as Mercutio staggers around the bridge in imitation of a love sick fool
Romeo, that she were,  that she An open-arse and thou a poperin pear
The hilarity is abruptly arrested as a security spotlight blazes to life, pinning Mercutio in its beam
The sound of automatic weapons cocking pierces the night
: Mercutio
He's brave but not stupid
He gets back into the car
(
) Come, shall we go
:  pair of stone cherubs on top of the retaining wall of a terraced garden
Romeo's face appears between them
Romeo hauls himself up onto the wall
Below is a Greco- Roman style pool area
To the right the darkened rear wing of Capulet Mansion
Suddenly the back of the house explodes with light
Romeo takes cover
But soft, what light through yonder window breaks
Romeo's question is answered as out onto the verandah comes Juliet
She is still clad in her angel robe, but without the halo and wings
She slowly descends to pool level
It is the East, and Juliet is the sun
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with That thou her maid art far more fair than she
Be not her maid, since she is envious
Her vestal livery is but sick and green, And none but fools do wear it
Juliet stands on the top step of the pool stairs
She is directly below Romeo as he whispers
(
) Cast it off
Juliet sits on the edge of the pool, her legs dangle in the water
(
) It is my lady
, it is my love
that she knew she were
Juliet sighs
Ay me
() She speaks
, speak again, bright angel
Juliet looks longingly toward the stars
Romeo, Romeo
- Whyfore art thou Romeo
Deny thy father and refuse thy name
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And 'll no longer be a Capulet
: Romeo
Incredulous
Shall  hear more, or shall  speak at this
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy
Thou are thyself, though not a Montague
What's Montague
It is not hand nor foot Nor arm nor face nor any other part Belonging to a man
, be some other name
What's in a name
That which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title
Romeo, doff thy name, And for thy name, which is no part of thee, Take all myself
Romeo wildly calls: take thee at thy word
Call me but love, and 'll be new baptised
Henceforth  never will be Romeo
Romeo jumps down from the wall
Juliet screams, and turns, toppling backwards
Romeo grabs her hand but her momentum overbalances him and they both plunge headlong into the pool
-  -
Underwater shot:  slow motion phosphorescent tangle of arms, legs and bodies
-
:  security guard
Alerted by the noise he moves toward the pool area
-   -
: Above water, real time: Romeo and Juliet surface spluttering
Juliet thrashes the water in an attempt to get distance from her attacker
What man art thou that, thus bescreened in night, So stumblest on my counsel
Romeo:  calming gesture as he tries to tread water
By a name  know not how to tell thee who  am: My name, dear saint, is hateful to Because it is an enemy to thee
The ferocious barking of a guard dog arrests the teenagers attention
moment, then they slide beneath the water
: The security guard and dog appearing above the pool area
'
: The rippling surface of the water
-  : Romeo and Juliet submerged, hair streaming, stare at each other like two beautiful fish
: The guard
He can see noisy caterers cleaning up around the other side of the house
Frowning, he returns the way he came
: Romeo and Juliet
Gasping for air, they cautiously surface
moment - then Juliet, a small smile
Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike
Juliet looks nervously toward the house
She drags Romeo toward a small grotto at the end of the pool
How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and whyfore
The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art
(with splashy bravado) With love's light wings did  o'er perch these walls
For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do, that dares love attempt
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me
Juliet drags Romeo firmly into the grotto
(a real fear) If they do see thee, they will murder thee
Romeo slowly pulls Juliet toward him
have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes
And but thou love me, let them find me here
My life were better ended by their Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love
The lovers kiss long and deep
Then Juliet, suddenly fearful, pushes Romeo away
Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek, For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight
Fain would  dwell on form - fain, fain deny What  have spoke
But farewell compliment
Dost thou love me
Romeo tries to speak, Juliet silences him
(
) know thou wilt say 'Ay', and will take thy word
Yet, if thou swearest, Thou mayst prove false
gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully
Or if thou think'st  am too quickly won, 'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay, So thou wilt woo
But else, not for the world
In truth, fair Montague,  am too fond, And therefore thou mayst think my 'haviour light
But trust me, gentleman, 'll prove more true Than those that have more cunning to be strange
Lady, by yonder blessed moon  vow, That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops - , swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable
What shall  swear by
Do not swear at all
Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And 'll believe thee
She touches his cheek
Romeo moves his lips close
If my heart's dear love - Confused, Juliet breaks away
Well, do not swear
Although  joy in thee, have no joy of this contract tonight
It is too rash, too unadvised, too ; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'it lightens
' Sweet, good night
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet
Good night, good night
As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast
She rushes up the stairs - Romeo follows desperately
, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied
Juliet - a shocked look
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight
: Romeo
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine
: Juliet
She runs joyously to Romeo
gave thee mind before thou didst request it
Kissing him passionately
(
) And yet  would it were to give again
Wouldst thou withdraw it
For what purpose love
But to be frank and give it thee again
They kiss again
The Nurse calls from inside
(/) Juliet
Juliet looks to the house
() Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed
If that thy bent of love be honourable
Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow, By one that 'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite, And all my fortunes at thy foot 'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world
(/) Madam
come, anon - But if thou meanest not well, do beseech thee
(/) Madam
(to Nurse) By and by  come
To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief
Tomorrow will  send
Romeo holds Juliet's gaze
So thrive my soul
(/) Madam
Juliet breaks away
thousand times good night
With a final kiss, Juliet runs inside
thousand times the worse, to want thy light
Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books; But love from love, toward school with heavy looks
Juliet re-appears at the upper balcony
Romeo
What o'clock tomorrow Shall  send to thee
By the hour of nine
Juliet unclasps a delicate silver necklace from around her neck
will not fail
'Tis twenty year till then
Goodnight, goodnight
Parting is such sweet sorrow
That  shall say goodnight till it be morrow
She lets the necklace fall from her hand
Romeo catches it and she is gone
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast, Would  were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest
Morning sunlight filters through the lush foliage of a tropical rainforest
: As we hear: (/) mickle is the powerful grace that In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities
We discover the intensely concentrating features of Fifties, wiry and wearing a priest's collar, Laurence delicately makes an incision in the bulb of a small purple flowered plant
pair of fresh faced ten year old boys look on in wonderment as a vivid blue sap oozes from the incision
(
) Within the infant rind of this weak Poison hath residence, and medicine power
: The Priest carefully gathers the sap into a beaker
We discover that we are in a small tropical greenhouse
(
) (to the boys) For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; Being tasted, stays all senses with the heart
The boys follow the Father as he moves out of the greenhouse and into an adjoining work area
The walls are lined with bottles of herbs and dried plants and a television flickers in the corner
(
) For naught so vile on the earth doth live, But to the earth some special good doth give; With the precision of a chemist, Father Laurence funnels the sap into a small bottle and places it in the refrigerator
From out of the refrigerator he produces a large jar of candy
He eyes the boys sternly
(
) Nor aught so good but, strained from that fair use, Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse
The boys take their candy and scram
: The muted television
morning news program shows footage of a murder scene cordoned off with police tape distraught mother is being restrained
: The priest contemplating the television
Two such opposed kings encamp them In man as well as herbs: grace and rude will; And where the worser is predominant, Full soon the canker death eats up that plant
feverish knocking breaks the priest's reverie
(/) Good morrow, father
Father Laurence snaps off the television and exits the workroom
Romeo, dressed in last night's chain mail, pounds desperately on a wooden door set into a high stone wall
Good morrow, father
From the workroom, Father Laurence enters a courtyard which encloses a tranquil tropical garden
He opens a door in the wall of the courtyard and smiles as the costumed Romeo bursts in
Benedicite
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me
Without pausing, the priest continues through the courtyard and toward the church
(
) Young son, it argues a distempered So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed
Or if not so, then here  hit it right - Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight
The priest enters the back of the church
Romeo, on fire to tell of his experience, follows the priest into the sacristy
The last is true
The sweeter rest was mine
(he stops) God pardon sin
Wast thou with Rosaline
With Rosaline, my ghostly father
No
have forgot that name and that name's woe
The Father lays out the cut glass bottles and communion tray for mass
That's my good son
But where hast thou been then
Unconsciously, Romeo helps the priest prepare
It is clear he knows the routine by heart
have been feasting with mine enemy, Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
That's by me wounded
Both our Within they help and holy physic lies
(buttoning a long black cassock) Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift
Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set, On the fair daughter of rich Capulet
We met, we wooed, and made exchange of vow, 'll tell thee as we pass
But this  pray, That thou consent to marry us today
: The Priest, thunderstruck
The two kids, now dressed in red altar-boy robes, enter
Good morrow, Romeo
The apoplectic priest waves the boys away
They get the message and bolt
Holy Saint Francis
What a change is here
Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear, So soon foresaken
Young men's love then lies Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline
(very angry) For doting, not for loving, pupil mine
pray thee chide me not
Her love now Doth grace for grace and love for love allow
The other did not so
, she knew well Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell
The Father falls into a chair and considers
He looks through the sacristy door to where a small children's choir has assembled
Their angelic voices soar into the purest of hymns
How can you just leave me standing Alone in a world so cold, Maybe 'm just too demanding, Maybe 'm just like my father, too bold, Maybe you're just like my mother, She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other
This is what it sounds like when doves cry
We recognise the hymn as "When Doves Cry" by Prince
: On the Priest; moved, he looks to Romeo
But come, young waverer, come, go with me
In one respect 'll thy assistant be
For this alliance may so happy To turn your households' rancor to pure love
Romeo hurriedly assists the priest with his vestments
, let us hence
stand on sudden haste
Father Laurence holds Romeo in his powerful gaze
Wisely and slow
They stumble that run fast
The procession is joined by the two little altar boys and the mass begins
As the Angelic voices of the choir soar, we see a pay phone etched with hyper-real starkness against the white sand, green sea and blue sky
single leaning palm tree frames the image like a ridiculous tourist postcard
Benvolio speaks on the pay phone
Mercutio, torso naked but for his holstered Sports Rapier 9mm, drums his fingers on the side of the booth
Where the devil should this Romeo be
Came he not home tonight
(slamming down the phone) Not to his father's
spoke with his man
Mercutio storms off down the beach
Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, Torments him so that he will sure run mad
(running to keep up) Tybalt hath sent a letter to his father's house
(halts abruptly) challenge, on my life
: Benvolio, unsure
Romeo will answer it
Any man that can write may answer a letter
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared
Mercutio clamps Benvolio into a headlock
Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead
Stabbed with a white wench's black eye, He whispers into Benvolio's ear: (
) Run through the ear with a love song
(in disgust) And is he a man to encounter Tybalt
(struggling to break free) Why, what is Tybalt
(releasing him) More than Prince of Cats,  can tell you
, he's the courageous captain of compliments
The very butcher of a silk button
Lightening fast, Mercutio draws his gun
He twirls it in an impressive display of gunmanship which ends with the barrel between the startled Benvolio's eyes
(
) duellist, a duellist
Romeo's car pulls into the beach side parking lot
Benvolio heads toward it
Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo
-
Romeo alights from his car and throws his keys to Balthasar who lounges outside the beach side hang
Mercutio saunters up the beach with mock nonchalance
Signor Romeo, Bonjour
There's a French salutation to your French slop
You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night
Good morrow to you both
What counterfeit did  give you
The slip, sir, the slip
Can you not conceive
Romeo smiles smugly
Pardon, good Mercutio
My business was great, and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy
() most courteous exposition
Nay  am the very pink of courtesy
() Pink for flower
The boys laugh
Romeo feigns anger
will bite thee on the ear for that jest
Mercutio, goading Romeo to follow, backs off down the beach
Come between us, good Benvolio
My wits faint
Mercutio flicks sand at Romeo, then sprints off down the beach
Romeo, laughing, gives chase
Switch and spurs, switch and spurs, or 'll cry a match
-
Romeo is gaining on Mercutio, who runs headlong into the sea
With a yell, Romeo dives in after him
-
Mercutio splashes the laughing Romeo
Why, is not this better now than groaning for love
Romeo tries to dunk Mercutio
(
) Now art thou sociable
Mercutio, evading, heads for shore
(
) Now art thou Romeo
Now art thou
-
Romeo tackles Mercutio on the wet sand
Mercutio falls suddenly serious
(
) () What thou art, by art as well as by nature
moment between the boys
shadow falls across them
Romeo looks up
Here's goodly gear
Standing above the boys is the Nurse
She wears a ridiculous, all red, "Jackie " style disguise of sunglasses, scarf and parasol
() God ye good e'en fair gentlewoman
The nurse, ignoring Mercutio, speaks dramatically to Romeo
desire some confidence with you
She turns and walks back to the parking lot where Peter the chauffer waits beside the limousine
Benvolio and the other boys look on curiously
bawd, a bawd, a bawd
So ho
But Romeo rises and to the amazement of Mercutio actually follows this woman
Mercutio looks questioningly to Benvolio, who shrugs
She will endite him to some supper
Even more strangely, Romeo gets into the limousine
(taken by surprise) Romeo, will you come to your father's
We'll to dinner thither
(as he closes the door) will follow you
Farewell, ancient lady
Farewell
The car pulls away
The limousine drives through Verona Beach
: Romeo jammed into the corner of the seat
The Nurse's face is pressed alarmingly close to his
She speaks in cold deadly earnest
If ye should lead her in a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say
For the gentlewoman is young; and therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing and very weak dealing
: Romeo chooses his words carefully
Bid her to come to confession this afternoon, And there she shall at Friar Laurence's cell Be shrived and (  : Romeo) married
'
: Juliet's face peering out her bedroom window
God she comes
-
: '
: The limousine pulls up at the front door, the Nurse alights
Juliet bolts from the room
Juliet hurries down the stairs - the Nurse, a way ahead, disappears into a doorway
Juliet races down a dark stairwell that leads to the bowels of the house
The kitchen, obviously the Nurse's domain, is decorated with a mixture of religious iconography and travel posters
Most of the posters depict a strange city of decadent, decaying, beauty
Juliet bursts breathlessly into the room
honey nurse, what news
The Nurse, buried up to her ample hips inside the refrigerator, does not turn around
Juliet cries impatiently
Nurse
The nurse emerges from the ice box laden with food
Moving to the counter she starts to make a sandwich
am aweary, give me leave awhile
Fie, how my bones ache
What a jaunce have
Juliet under her breath
would thou hadst my bones and thy news
Juliet goes to the nurse
Nay come,  pray thee, speak: good; Nurse, speak
Sandwich made, the nurse shuffles over to a corner couch
Jesu, what haste
Can you not stay awhile
Can you not see  am out of breath
Juliet cannot stand the suspense any longer
How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath
Is the news good or bad
Answer to that
The Nurse takes a big bite from her sandwich and answers through thoughtful chews
Well, you have made a simple choice
You know not how to choose a man
Romeo
No, not he
Though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's and for a hand and a foot and a body, though they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare
He's not the flower of courtesy, but 'll warrant him as gentle as a lamb
Go thy ways, wench, serve God
What, have you dined at home
Juliet is flabbergasted
No, no
But all this  did know before
What says he of our marriage
What of that Lord how my head aches
What a head have : My back - This is a game that Juliet knows well
She moves behind the Nurse and begins massaging her back
(
) o' t'other side - ah, my back
Beshrew your heart for sending me To catch my death with jauncing up and down
With sublime self control, Juliet coo's sweetly
'faith  am sorry that thou art not well
Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what says my love
Your love says like an honest gentleman, And a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, And  warrant a virtuous - Where is your mother
Juliet cracks
Where is my mother
How oddly thou repliest
'Your love says, like an honest gentleman, "Where is your mother"'
The nurse sulks
God's lady dear are you so hot
Henceforth do your messages yourself
Juliet's frustration explodes
Here's such a coil : The Nurse considers Juliet
Have you got leave to go to confession today
have
Then hie you hence to Father Laurence cell
There stays a husband to make you a wife
Juliet, with a scream of joy, hugs the Nurse to her
: Juliet's ecstatic features
:  : These violent delights have violent ends
: Father Laurence is preaching energetically from the pulpit
Hidden from the congregation, Romeo waits in a small alcove chapel at the side of the altar
(
) The sweetest honey Is loathsome in its own deliciousness, Therefore love moderately
The Father glances toward Romeo
(
) Long love doth so
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow
Juliet pushes through the double doors at the far end of the church
Father Laurence motions to the middle-aged choir master who leads the choir into a choral version of Led Zeppelin's " Whole Lot of Love" with Latin lyrics
Father Laurence hurries from the altar over to Romeo
(
) Here comes the lady
Juliet bursts into the tiny chapel
Trying to observe a vestige of decorum, she greets Father Laurence
Good afternoon to my ghostly confessor
But before the priest can reply, the two lovers embrace, kissing passionately
() Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both
The choir completes the hymn and the priest, realising it is his cue, rushes back to the altar
He quickly delivers a prayer to the congregation while eyeing the increasingly amorous smooching of the young couple
The choir launch into a joyous chorus and the priest returns to Romeo and Juliet
He delicately parts the couple
(
) Come, come, and we will make short work
For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone Till Holy Church incorporate two in one
young boy with a voice like Jamiroquai steps forward
He launches into a wailing solo
:  simple silver ring
Engraved on the inside of the band are the words ' love thee
' : Romeo slips the ring onto Juliet's finger as the priest executes the formal sacrament of marriage
/
: Through the majestic patterning of stained glass, and out of the church to find Peter, the chauffeur, cradling a small camera as he waits nervously beside the limo
The music swells in celebration
Romeo and Juliet, now newly-wed, rush from the side door of the church
The priest follows, throwing handfuls of rice
Peter studiously takes a snap as the bride and groom kiss
Peter holds the door of the limousine open
Reluctantly Juliet gets into the car
As the car pulls out of the driveway, Romeo runs alongside
: On Romeo as he watches the big black car speed away
- : From the bottom of the ocean; Mercutio's distorted features
Gun aimed, he stares intently into the water
muffled
and a bullet whizzes past the camera
We see that Mercutio - wading in knee deep water close to the beach - is hunting fish
Benvolio shelters in the shade of an unmanned life guard tower
shimmering heat haze blankets the deserted beach and the horizon is stacked with purple storm clouds
pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire
The day is hot, Mercutio, ignoring him, plugs away at another fish
Benvolio nervously looks to see if there is any reaction to the sound of the shot
(
) The Capels are abroad
And if we meet we shall not 'scape a brawl
Mercutio strides out of the water
Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and says 'God send me no need of thee
' (he hands Benvolio his gun) and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need
Another incredible sleight of hand routine and Mercutio has managed to draw Benvolio's pistol, retrieve his own gun, and trap Benvolio with a barrel at each temple
The joke has worn thin for Benvolio; he pushes past Mercutio toward where Balthasar, Sampson and Gregory lounge in the shade of the beach-side hang
Suddenly he stops dead - a monstrous black sedan prowls into the beach side parking lot
By my head, here comes the Capulets
By my heel,  care not
-
The sedan mounts the curb and slides to a halt only metres from Benvolio and Mercutio
Tybalt, Abra and Petruchio alight from the sedan and walk menacingly toward Mercutio and Benvolio
Gentlemen, good day
word with one of you
The boys from the hang, drawn the Capulet car, converge - eyes dart nervously, hands stray towards guns
Mercutio smiles mockingly
And but one word with one of us
Couple it with something
Make it a word and a
Leaning close to Tybalt, he camps the implication
(
) blow
Mercutio scores
The boys laugh
() You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, (clutching at his side arm) And you will give me occasion
: Mercutio
He stops, eyeing the hand on the gun
No one moves
(a breathy, coquettish ) Could you not take some occasion without giving
The boys fall about again
Tybalt cracks
Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo
The accusation stings - Mercutio's anger flares
Consort
What, dost thou make us minstrels
And thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing but discords
Here's my fiddlestick
Indicating his holstered gun
(
) Here's that shall make you dance
(barking at Tybalt) Zounds, (goading him to go for his gun) consort
: Tybalt
: Mercutio
He will not back down
Benvolio tries to diffuse things
Either withdraw unto some private place
Or reason coldly of your grievances
Here all eyes gaze on us
Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze
will not budge for no man's pleasure,
At that moment, Romeo's car pulls into the lot
Tybalt smiles
Well sir, here comes my man
Tybalt moves toward Romeo who bounds from his car full of happy news
Romeo, the love  bear thee can No better term than this: : Tybalt
He clears his jacket from his side arm and issues the challenge
(
) Thou art a villain
: Mercutio
: Benvolio
All eyes are on Romeo
Romeo calmly approaches his now cousin
Tybalt, the reason that  have to love thee Doth much excuse the appertaining To such a greeting: villain am none, Therefore farewell
see thou knowest me not
Romeo turns, and to the amazement of all, walks back to his car
Tybalt, unable to shoot him in the back, is confused
He hurls himself into his sedan
Kicking it into a sand spraying -turn, he careens the short distance to Romeo's car
Slamming into the back of it he blocks Romeo in
Tybalt leaps out, maniacally kicking at bumper, door and headlights
Romeo flicks the locks down
Tybalt shatters the side window and hauls Romeo through the door, slamming him against the savaged fuselage
Boy, this shall not excuse the That thou hast done me
He smashes Romeo across the face, Romeo crashes to the roadway
() Turn and draw
cut has opened in the side of Romeo's mouth
He unsteadily lifts himself up, and meeting Tybalt's gaze, speaks through bloodied teeth
never injured thee, And so, good Capulet, which name As dearly as mine own
Romeo cautiously extracts his gun
(
) be satisfied
and throws it at Tybalt's feet
Storm clouds obscure the sun as Romeo turns and walks from the parking lot
Mercutio, Benvolio and the others cannot believe their eyes
calm, dishonourable, vile submission
-
Tybalt's anger must be answered
He ceremoniously disarms, gives his weapon to Abra, and sprints after Romeo who is now passing a beach side lot that houses an abandoned grand hotel
bone-cracking kick sends Romeo crumbling into the vacant lot
The boys swarm toward the fray
Romeo, still refusing the fight, scrambles up the stairs of the deserted hotel
Tybalt trips him and Romeo careens into an ornamental wooden railing, smashing it to pieces
Tybalt kicks savagely at the helpless Romeo
Suddenly, Mercutio appears running full tilt down the concrete terrace
He plucks up one of the splintered wooden palings and yells
(
) Tybalt, you ratcatcher, as he bludgeons him across the face
Tybalt goes down
(
) Will you walk
Tybalt leaps to his feet grabbing a lump of wood
What wouldst thou have with me
He swipes at Mercutio
() Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives
Mercutio jabs, Tybalt sidesteps
am for you
Tybalt aims a double-handed blow to Mercutio's head
Mercutio blocks, hooking Tybalt's stick away
Unarmed, Tybalt throws his full body weight upon Mercutio, slamming him against a window that shatters in a storm of glass
Lightning fast, Mercutio jackknifes to his feet
He raises his weapon to deliver a skull-crushing final blow to the trapped Tybalt
Romeo rushes between them
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio
Seizing the opportunity, Tybalt lunges at Romeo with a lethal triangle of broken glass
He misses, gouging instead a slash of flesh from Mercutio's stomach
scream of excruciating pain as Mercutio grabs at his bloodied side
Everyone is still
In the abrupt silence, sirens are heard closing in the distance
Abra tugs at Tybalt
Away Tybalt
They bolt for their vehicle
Benvolio goes to Mercutio
Art thou hurt
But Mercutio, covering his wound with his hand, laughs
Ay, ay, a scratch
He turns to his assembled fans at the bottom of the stairs
With outrageous bravado he plays at being Caesar the conqueror
(
) scratch
The boys cheer their conquering hero
Romeo helps Mercutio down the stairs
Courage, man
The hurt cannot be much
Mercutio holding his bleeding side, jokes through the pain
'Twill serve
Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man
He turns the next thought to the assembled audience
(
) (through crazy laughter) plague o' both your houses
Mercutio turns from the cheering boys to Romeo who is struggling to support his weight
Mercutio - through weak and desperate breathing
(
) Why the devil came you between us
was hurt under your arm
Romeo starts to register the panic in Mercutio's eyes
thought all for the best
Like an animal trying to break free from a mortal trap, Mercutio pushes Romeo away
He screams in horror, as if falling in the dark: plague o' both your houses
They have made worms' meat of me
Mercutio staggers down the stairs and collapses in the dirt
Romeo is there instantly, cradling his friend's head out of the dust
The dying boy stares back at Romeo, smiling through the chilling cold
(
) (a silent whisper) Your houses
Everything stands still, everything is quiet
The storm finally breaks
-
Tiny drops of water fall from the sky and bespeckle Mercutio's lifeless body
The droplets grow to a heavy rain
Romeo can hear the faint sound a thousand miles away of Benvolio whispering: Mercutio is dead
Tears streak Romeo's face
He cries out
Oh sweet Juliet, Thy beauty hath made me effeminate And in my temper softened valor's steel
The sound of Tybalt's vehicle starting brings back cold reality
Romeo's sorrow turns to uncontrollable rage
Shrugging aside Benvolio's attempts to restrain him, Romeo runs to his car
-
Up ahead Tybalt's sedan screeches into a fishtailing -turn and powers away
Romeo jumps into his vehicle
In an effort to head Tybalt off, he guns his damaged machine down a one way street
The rain is now blinding
Romeo stops for nothing; pedestrians flee, cars spin out of control
-
: The two cars speed along parallel roads toward Plaza Jesu
Romeo is gaining
-
: Tybalt's car negotiating the immense roundabout at the foot of the statue of Jesus
: Romeo's car firing out of the one way street and slamming into Tybalt's car
Tybalt's car careens out of control up the stairs of the statue, clips the fountain, flips, and slides upside down onto the roadway
: Tybalt scrambling from his upturned vehicle
: Romeo running toward him
Romeo is halted by Tybalt's drawn gun
Fearlessly marching toward it, he screams through tears
Mercutio's soul Is but a little way above our heads, Romeo grabs the barrel of the gun; forcing it between his own eyes, he growls insanely at Tybalt
(
) Staying for thine to keep him company
Tybalt, unnerved, tries to back off
Thou, wretched boy, shalt with him hence
Romeo, refusing to let go of the gun, forces Tybalt backward through the torrential rain
(with frightening intensity) Either thou or , or both, must go with him
Cars swerve, Romeo is relentless
He grips Tybalt's hand trying to force him to shoot
(
) Either thou or , or both, must go with him
Panicked, Tybalt wrenches free and lurches onto the roadway
Blinded by the headlights of an oncoming car he thuds onto its hood as it skids to a halt
The impact catapults his gun high into the air
Romeo coldly follows its slow motion, spinning trajectory
Real time stretches as the gun dances high above his head
Police sirens, cars swerving, people screaming, and the yelling of panicked commands fade to a nothingness
Romeo stands calmly considering the gun in the air harrowing symphonic tone and the echo of Mercutio's voice can be heard
(/) Why the devil came you between us
: Patrol cars sliding to a halt
: The spinning gun slowly falling to earth
: Tybalt rising from the ground
: Cops leaping from their cars
: The gun landing in Romeo's hand
His eyes full of rage
: Cops levelling their revolvers
(Romeo in his sights) Put up thy weapon
: Real time - Romeo fires three deliberate shots
Tybalt's body convulses backwards against the car, hitting it with a thud, bloodying the shattered windscreen
The cop fires
bullet grazes Romeo's arm - his gun drops as he screams
,  am fortune's fool
At that moment a roaring hurricane wind hits; blinding police
: The scaffolding surrounding the Jesus statue
Part of it's canvas covering rips away
Scaffold rains down as the insanely flapping material tries to smash free from it's moorings
Through the mayhem, a rusty Ford driven by Balthasar, slides to a halt
Balthasar screams out at Romeo
Romeo, away be gone
Stand not amazed
Romeo collapses into the front seat
The cops open fire as Balthasar speeds off into the storm
'
Romeo is bleeding from the bullet graze
The gale-force winds throw waves across the causeway as the fugitives disappear into the black afternoon
: In the distance we see Montague and Capulet towers
Divided by the statue of Christ, they suffer the storm's rage
Away, below the outstretched arms of Christ, lights from emergency vehicles pulse red through the downpour
: Falls through heavy rain toward a woman crouched over the lifeless body of Tybalt
She cries: Tybalt
Cops nervously eye Fulgencio Capulet and Ted Montague, who, both flanked by body guards, face each other across the crime scene
Medics stand by helplessly as Gloria clings to Tybalt's body
handcuffed Benvolio looks on
(
) Tybalt, my cousin,  my brother's child
, the blood is spilled of my dear kinsman
Police lines part as Captain Prince arrives
Where are the vile beginners of this fray
Benvolio struggles forward
noble Prince  can discover all The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl
Gloria appeals hysterically: Prince as thou art true, For blood of ours shed blood of Montague
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray
(pointing to Tybalt's corpse) There lies the man, slain by young Romeo, That slew thy kinsman brave Mercutio
Gloria interjects savagely
He speaks not true
Affection makes him false
Romeo, that spoke him fair, could not take Truce with the unruly spleen of Deaf to peace
He is a kinsman to the Montague
beg for justice which thou Prince must give
Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live
Captain Prince turns to Gloria
Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe
Ted Montague pleads: Not Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio's friend; His fault concludes but what the law should end, The life of Tybalt
Captain Prince eyes Montague coldly
And for that offence Immediately we do exile him
Montague, body guards in tow, surges forward
Noble Prince
Prince silences him
will be deaf to pleading and ; Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses
Therefore use none
The Captain turns and addresses his assembled officers
(
) Let Romeo hence in haste, Else, when he is found that hour is his last
: Captain Prince
(
) Bear hence this body and attend our will
Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill
'
An acoustic guitar version of Joy Division's 'Love Will Tear Us Apart
' Juliet traces the path of a raindrop on the window pane as she speaks her thoughts to the storm
Come gentle night, coming loving black browed night, Give me my Romeo
And when  shall die, Take him and cut him out in little stars, And he will make the face of heaven so fine That all the world will be in love with night, And pay no worship to the garish sun
,  have bought the mansion of a But not possessed it, and though am sold, Not yet enjoyed
So tedious is this day As is the night before some festival To an impatient child that hath new And may not wear them
'  -
Juliet's
: The limousine pulls into the driveway
: Of the window and  : Juliet runs from the room
Through the open doorway we see an excited Juliet meet the Nurse at the bottom of the stairs
The music surges
: The Nurse's words are lost in the storm
Juliet buckles
We are close enough now to hear Juliet's words
Oh God
Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood
It did, it did
Alas the day, it did
Oh serpent heart, hid with a flowering face
Was ever book containing such vile So fairly bound
, that deceit should dwell In such a gorgeous palace
There's no trust, No faith, no honesty in men
All perjured, All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers
Shame come to Romeo
Blistered be thy tongue For such a wish
He was not born to shame
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit
Will you speak well of him that killed your cousin
Shall  speak ill of him that is my husband
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name When , thy three-hours wife have mangled it
But whyfore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin
That villain cousin would have killed my husband
All this is comfort, wherefore weep then
Some word there was worser than Tybalt's death: would forget it fain - exiled
Tybalt is dead, and Romeo exiled
To speak that word is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet, all slain, All dead
Juliet sinks to the floor, overwhelmed by tears
(
) Nurse, 'll to my wedding bed, And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead
Nurse looks down at Juliet
She goes and comforts her
Hie to your chamber
'll find To comfort you
know well where he is
Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night
Juliet looks up through tears
find him, give this ring to my true knight, And bid him come to take his last farewell
: Into the ring
The screen fills with the words ' love thee'
Romeo lies on the bed shirtless and crying
His wound has been bandaged and Balthasar crouches frightened in the corner
The priest leads the Nurse into the room
Romeo looks up
Nurse
She goes to him
Ah sir
Ah sir
Death's the end of all
Speakest thou of Juliet
Where is she
And how doth she
And what says My concealed lady to our cancelled love
, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps, And then on Romeo cries, and then falls down again
Romeo is wailing inconsolably
As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun, Did murder her, as that name's cursed hand murdered her kinsman
Father Laurence shakes the hysterical boy
thought thy disposition better tempered
Thy Juliet is alive, There art thou happy
The law that threatened death becomes thy friend And turns it to exile
There art thou happy
pack of blessings light upon thy back
Romeo calms
The Nurse gives him the ring
Here sir, a ring my lady bid me give you
Romeo enfolds the ring in his hand
How well my comfort is revived by this
The priest goes to his wardrobe, removes a clean white shirt and helps Romeo put it on
Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed
Ascend her chamber
Hence and comfort her
But look thou stay not till the Watch be set, For then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thou shalt live till we can find a time To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends, Beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back, With twenty hundred thousand times more joy Than thou wentst forth in lamentation
Father Laurence ushers Romeo from the room
They hurry down the hallway
The priest opens the front door
Go hence
Be gone by the break of Sojourn in Mantua
Give me thy hand
Romeo embraces him
Farewell
The priest and Balthasar watch as Romeo and the Nurse sprint for the car
Sobs echo through the house
Dave Paris stands in the entrance hallway clutching a huge bunch of flowers
Fulgencio Capulet stands beside him, whisky glass in hand
: Gloria on the upper landing
There is a strange faraway quality about her as she descends to Dave and Capulet
She'll not come down tonight
Dave, an understanding smile
These times of woe afford no times to woo
Capulet guides Dave into the house
Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly
() And so did
(a cold glance at Gloria) Well, we were born to die
Capulet takes a large slug of whisky
Gloria leans close to Dave
'll know her mind early tomorrow
Tonight she's mewed up to her heaviness
As Gloria, Dave and Capulet exit down the hallway we : toward Juliet's bedroom door
'
: Juliet's face
Tears stream onto the pillow
Without warning a hand lightly touches her cheek
Juliet's eyes dart up to discover Romeo standing above her
still moment of disbelief
Leaning down, Roemo kisses away the tears that fall from her dark, wide eyes
Juliet's lips find Romeo's and they gently sink back onto the bed
Capulet sits in an armchair drinking
Dave and Gloria sit opposite as Capulet whips himself into a frenzy of drunken excitement
We'll keep no great ado - a friend or two
For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late, It may be thought we held him carelessly, Being our kinsman if we revel much - But soft what day is this
Monday my lord
Well Wednesday is too soon - what say you to Thursday
Gloria looks up alarmed; Dave is stunned
My lord
(leaning close) will make a desperate tender of my child's love
(a drunken good humour) think she will be ruled in all respects by me; (exploding with hearty laughter) Nay, more,  doubt it not
: Gloria, her face hardens
(to Dave) But what say you to Thursday
Dave is trying to catch up
My lord
: Capulet he eyes Dave intently
(
) would that Thursday were tomorrow
Delighted, Capulet jumps to his feet
Thursday let it be then
Capulet holds out his glass in toast
Dave and Gloria rise
Wife, go you to Juliet ere you go to bed
Tell her, a Thursday she shall be To this noble sir
: The glasses clink
pink and gold dawn breaks over Capulet Mansion
'
tangle of young limbs
Romeo and Juliet blissfully asleep
The dawn light creeps into the room
Balthasar's car covertly pulls into a side road near the estate
'
Romeo and Juliet still asleep
: Toward the sleeping innocence of the faces
:  shadow of fear passes across Romeo's features
With a cry of panic, he sits bolt upright
Wide awake, but disorientated, Romeo stares around the room - as Juliet stirs, he remembers where he is
Slipping quietly from the bed, Romeo begins to dress
: Romeo
pair of lips enter frame and find his neck
It is Juliet
She hugs herself to him
Wilt thou be gone
It is not yet near day
Romeo turns - softly he strokes her cheek
must be gone and live, or stay and die
Juliet kisses his finger-tips
Yond light is not daylight, And then his cheek
(
) know it, It is some meteor that the sun To light thee on thy way to Mantua
Therefore stay yet
Thou needest not to be gone
Romeo, feverishly returning the kisses, throws himself on Juliet
Let me be taken, let me be put to death
have more care to stay than will to go
Come, death, and welcome
Juliet wills it so
Juliet is suddenly still
Romeo kisses her gently
(
) How is't, my soul
Let's talk
It is not day
Juliet pulls Romeo to his feet
It is, it is
Hie hence, be gone, away
, now be gone
More light and light it grows
Frantically she helps him into his clothes
More light and light: more dark and dark our woes
There is an urgent knocking on the door
They freeze
(/) Madam
Nurse
(/) Your lady mother is coming to your chamber
Then, window, let day in, and let life out
Desperately Juliet pulls Romeo out onto the balcony
The storm, now past, has left a morning achingly pure
Farewell, farewell
One kiss, and 'll descend
Romeo climbs down from the balcony and into the shadows
, think'st thou we shall ever meet again
Romeo smiles up at her
doubt it not; Juliet's face darkens
God,  have an ill-divining soul
Methinks  see thee, now thou art so low, As one dead in the bottom of a tomb
Romeo scrambles back up to the balcony
Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve For sweet discourses in our times to come
From Juliet's bedroom comes the brittle sound of Gloria Capulet's voice
Ho daughter
Are you up
Juliet spins around
Gloria has parted the curtains and is staring directly at her daughter
Well, well
: Romeo sheltered just below the lip of the balcony
: His hand, as it slowly reaches up and touches Juliet's fingers hidden behind her back
Gloria returns to the room
Juliet steals a glance toward Romeo as he silently mouths: Adieu, adieu
As Romeo's face disappears into the shadows Juliet whispers a little prayer to herself
Fortune, Fortune
Be fickle, Fortune, Fo then  hope thou wilt not keep him long But send him back
'
Juliet is trying not to cry as she goes in to her mother
Gloria turns to her
Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy That thou expects not nor  looked not for
Juliet plays along
Madam, in happy time
What day is that
Gloria takes a deep breath
Marry, my child, early next Thursday The gallant, young, and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride
: Juliet
She can barely speak
Now by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too, He shall not make me there a joyful bride
Fear passes across Gloria's face
Here comes your father
Tell him so yourself
Capulet - whisky glass in hand - ebulliently bursts into the room
How now, wife
Have you delivered to her our decree
Ay, sir
But she will none, she gives you thanks
would the fool were married to her grave
Capulet - a dangerous calm
How
Will she none
Is she not proud
Doth she not count her blest, Unworthy as she is, that we have So worthy a gentleman to be her bride
Not proud you have, but thankful that you have
Proud can  never be of what  hate
: Capulet considers his daughter, then - He hurls his glass against the wall, shattering it into a thousand pieces
Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds, But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next
Capulet advances
Juliet, terrified, retreats into the hallway
Hear me with patience but to speak a word
The Nurse appears as Capulet picks his daughter up and shakes her like a rag doll
Speak not, reply not, do not answer me
He throws her to the floor
His fist thuds as it slams into her face
() Fie, fie
What are you mad
Gloria tries to restrain Capulet
He back-hands her, sending her flying against the wall - bellowing insanely, he advances on his cowering daughter
Hang thee, young baggage
Disobedient wretch
The Nurse throws herself between Capulet and Juliet
God in heaven bless her
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so
Furious, Capulet shunts her aside
Peace, you mumbling fool
Capulet yanks his daughter's face close to his
(
) tell thee what - get thee to church a Thursday Or never after look me in the face
And you be mine, 'll give you to my friend
And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets, Trust to it
Bethink you
'll not be forsworn
Capulet storms off down the hall
: Juliet
She huddles, shaking at the top of the stairs
sweet my mother, cast me not away
Delay this marriage for a month, a week
Or if you do not, make the bridal In that dim monument where Tybalt lies
trickle of blood issues from Gloria's cut lip
She checks her appearance in the hall mirror
Talk not to me, for 'll not speak a word
Do as thou wilt, for  have done with thee
Gloria leaves
God
-  Nurse, how shall this be prevented
The Nurse doesn't reply
(
) What sayest thou
Hast thou not a word of joy
Some comfort, Nurse
heavy silence
The Nurse goes to Juliet
Faith, here it is
think it best you married with this Paris
, he's a lovely gentleman
think you are happy in this second match, For it excels your first; or if it did not, Your first is dead - or 'twere as good he were As living here and you no use of him
Juliet is very still
Speakest thou from thy heart
And from my soul too
Else beshrew them both
Amen
() What
Juliet is matter of fact
Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much
Go in; and tell my lady  am gone, Having displeased my father, to Friar Laurence, To make confession and to be absolved
The old woman nods
She strokes Juliet's hair
This is wisely done
Juliet does not look up
disturbing choral chant: : Sunlight pierces stained glass - the chant a sinister underscoring
We hear Dave Paris' voice: (/) Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death
: Father Laurence and Dave Paris stand at the front of the church
(
) Now, sir, her father counts it That she doth give her sorrow so much sway, And in his wisdom hastes our To stop the inundation of her tears
Father Laurence turns
Juliet stands framed in the white glare of the doorway
Dave smiles
Happily met, my lady and my wife
: Juliet's hand concealed beneath her coat - we can just see the handle of a gun
Juliet advances slowly, an icy calm: That may be, sir, when  may be a wife
That 'may be', must be, love, on Thursday next
Juliet stares past Dave
What must be, shall be
Father Laurence, a forced cheerfulness
That's a certain text
Come you to make confession
Juliet forces a smile
Are you at leisure, holy father, now
Or shall  come to you at evening mass
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now
(to Dave) We must entreat the time alone
God shield  should disturb devotion
- Juliet, on Thursday early will  rouse ye; Dave bends
: Juliet; she stares stonily ahead as Dave kisses her cheek
(
) Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss
Dave leaves
: Juliet; she runs for the sacristy
The priest follows
Juliet, shaking with sobs takes refuge in the shadows of the small room
The priest goes to her
Juliet,  already know thy grief
Juliet pulls away
Tell me not, Father, that thou hearest of this, Unless thou tell me how  may prevent it
It strains me past the compass of my wits
() If in thy wisdom thou canst give no Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this 'll help it presently
She pulls the gun, pointing it towards herself
Horrified, Father Laurence moves to her
Juliet, panicked, levels the gun at him
Hold daughter
(through tears) Be not so long to speak
lone to die
Father Laurence holds out a soothing hand
do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate an As that is desperate which we would prevent
If, rather than marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt thing like death
We hear the distended chords of Faure's Requiem
(
) to chide away this shame
It continues throughout as; The entire screen fills with a glinting tear drop of blue liquid
Reflected in the fluid's convex surface, the face of Father Laurence
The face disappears as the tear drop falls and splashes into a clear water solution
Like a comet in slow motion, the drop stains the water a cobalt hue
: The blue liquid fills a tiny glass vial held by Father Laurence
(
) No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest
Each part, deprived of supple government, Shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death
Now when the bridegroom in the Comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou, dead
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie
In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, And hither shall he come
And that very Night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua
The priest cautiously hands Juliet the vial
(
) Take thou this vial, being then in bed, And this distilling liquor drink thou off
'll send my letters to thy lord with speed to Mantua
As Father Laurence speaks, the screen fills with an express envelope addressed "Romeo - Mantua
" The envelope pulls away from the camera and falls into a canvas bag brimming with hundreds of like envelopes
: With the canvas bag
It continues its journey into the back of an express delivery van
Heavy double doors slam shut, filling the screen with the slogan 'Speed Express
' The van pulls away
: burning red sun is setting over an endless vista of ragged wasteland
:  weathered sign reads - Mantua: Behind it a vast colony of permanent trailer homes stretches into the distance
The rap, rap, rap of knocking echoes through the park
: The source of the knocking
An express delivery man, envelope in hand, raps vigorously on the door of an unremarkable trailer
: Romeo lies flat on a single bed in the crampled trailer
The rap, rap, rap is very loud now
We move toward Romeo and realise he cannot hear the knocking because he has Walkman headphones on
Unsuccessful, the delivery man is filling out a " " card
He pushes it under the door
: The heraldic 'Wedding Chimes' by  Bach
Juliet stands resplendent in a radiant bridal gown
The image floats ethereally in a towering slab of mirror
: From the mirror
The wedding dress is in fact being held in front of Juliet by two members of the house staff
Juliet is dressed in her night gown
The Nurse suggests various pairs of shoes
() Ay, these attires are best
The fuss dispensed with, the staff leave
But, gentle Nurse, pray thee leave me to myself tonight
Why Bride
Juliet navigates the Nurse toward the door
(almost in tears) To move the heavens to smile upon my state, Which, well thou knowest, is cross and full of sin
Juliet holds the Nurse in a pleading stare
She leaves
Alone now, Juliet hurries to her bedside drawer
She cautiously removes a rolled piece of cloth from which she produces the glass vial
() What if this mixture do not work at all
Shall  be married then tomorrow morning
She cautiously begins to unscrew the tiny black lid
Suddenly, a knock at her door
Palming the vial, Juliet swings around to meet the arrival of her mother
Gloria probes her daughter's uneasiness
What, are you busy, ho
Need you my help
(makes light of it) No, madam
We have culled such As are behoveful for our state tomorrow
So please you, let me now be left alone, And let the Nurse this night sit up with you
Juliet begins to pull down the covers on her bed
(
) For  am sure you have your hands full all In this so sudden business
Gloria, sensing Juliet's distress, moves cautiously toward her
Taking hold of the bed covers she helps her daughter into bed
Good night
Juliet slides into bed
Gloria covers her with the blanket
(
) Get thee to bed, and rest, for thou hast need
brief moment between mother and daughter
Gloria, unable to cross that final barrier, moves to the door; but she is stopped by the urgency in Juliet's voice
Farewell
Gloria turns to Juliet
(
) God knows when we shall meet again
: Gloria
faint perplexity, and then with an almost warm smile she turns out the light and leaves
The room is in darkness but for patterns of moonlight through windows
: Toward Juliet
The sombre tones of Faure's Requiem seep into our consciousness
have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins That almost freezes up the heat of life
She brings the vial her mouth
(
) Come, vial
Romeo,  drink to thee
Juliet drinks, a sudden violent convulsion, her face contorts in fear
: The sky is filled with green and grey clouds
gusty rain blows the flower arrangements across the lawn
Large white wedding marquees flap in the wind
Through blurring rain, we see ambulances and police vehicles, lights flashing
Father Laurence, accompanied by a dour looking man in black, alights from his car
We follow their : We hear snatches of radio calls
( ) Mortal drugs
( ) Of lethal quantity as 'twould render death
-
They enter the house and pass the vast dining room, bedecked with wedding decorations
Capulet sits at the large mahogany table
In the background Gloria stares vacantly
Moving swiftly toward a doorway, the music builds
- '
The door opens
On the bed Juliet's still body
Father Laurence closes the door
The priest kneels and hastily examines Juliet's pupils
He looks to the man in black who retrieves the glass vial from the floor and pockets it
(to the man in black) As the custom is, In all her best array bear her to church
When the man in black allows two other dark suited men into the room, it becomes clear he is the undertaker
She shall be borne to that same ancient vault Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie
thousand voices proclaim the 'Song of Ascension
' : From the vaulting glass ceiling of the Capulet mausoleum
On view, enshrined in literally thousands of lit candles, is Juliet's peaceful body
We move through lines of Capulet mourners
In the shadows of the front door a young man hides
: The young man
We recognise the distressed face of Balthasar
: Balthasar rushes from the Mausoleum
We are high above Mantua
Beyond the trailer park stretches a long ribbon of black highway
As a Speed Express van turns off the highway and into the park, we hear Romeo's voice over: (/) If  may trust the flattering truth of sleep My dreams presage some joyful news at hand
: The Express van pulls up at the front office
The driver alights and goes inside
Romeo sits at the trailer's small kitchen table smoking and writing in his notebook
The " " card lies next to an overflowing ashtray
His voice over continues
(/) And all this day an unaccustomed Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts
dreamt my lady came and found me And breathed such life with kisses in my lips That  revived and was an emperor
Ah me, how sweet is love itself When but love's shadows are so rich in joy
Stubbing out his cigarette, Romeo gazes through the trailer window to see Balthasar's speeding car turn off the highway and into the trailer park
News from Verona
An excited Romeo rushes from the trailer
: Romeo sprints across open ground to intercept Balthasar's car
We see, but Romeo cannot, the Express van approaching from the office
The car slews to a halt and Balthasar jumps out
Romeo yells joyously
How now, Balthasar
Bathlasar cannot speak
(
) Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest
How doth my lady
Is my father well
How doth my lady Juliet
That ask again, For nothing can be ill if she be well
Balthasar does not know how to say what he has come to tell
He looks away
Then she is well and nothing can be ill
Her body sleeps in Capels' monument, And her immortal part with angels lives
saw her laid low in her kindred's vault
For a long moment Romeo is profoundly still
When he speaks, it is with a chilling calm
Is it e'en so
Balthasar nods
Romeo turns and stares into the distant wasteland
: He speaks with bitter determination
Then  defy you stars
Romeo moves to the car
will hence tonight
Balthasar tries to restrain him
Have patience
Exploding with fury, Romeo throws Balthasar against the vehicle
Leave me
: The Speed Express messenger
Returning to his truck, the priest's undelivered envelope in his hand, the messenger looks toward the two boys
: The boys
Balthasar pleads with Romeo
Your looks are pale and wild and do Some misadventure
(with cold serenity) Tush, thou art deceived
(a niggling thought) Hast thou no letters to me from the Priest
Balthasar shakes his head
Romeo smiles
No matter -  will hence tonight
Romeo climbs into the passenger seat of the car
Balthasar reluctantly gets behind the wheel
As silent tears begin to flow, Romeo turns his face to the setting sun
: As he whispers: Well Juliet,  will lie with thee tonight
Balthasar's car roars out of the park
: The delivery man
He looks to the envelope in his hand, then gets back into his truck
Balthasar's car speeds along the night-time highway
: In the distance the glow of city lights
Balthasar's car pulls into an alley and stops outside a decrepity apartment block
:  bespectacled eye peers through the crack of a partly open doorway
Below the face, the barrel of a shotgun protrudes menacingly
: Romeo in the dark, paint peeling hallway
Let me have dram of poison, such soon- speeding gear As will disperse itself through all the veins That the life-weary taker may fall dead
The eye considers, a voice rasps back
Such mortal drugs  have, but Verona's law Is death to any he that utters them
Romeo speaks with fury
The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law
Then be not poor, but break it and take this
Romeo shoves a wad of money at  ' face
The rattle of a latch chain and the door swings open
Standing in the doorway is The Apothecary
Sixty something, he has a face scarred with age and abuse
My poverty, but not my will consents
: Romeo
pay thy poverty and not thy will
: Father Laurence
He speaks into the telephone with concern
Who bore my letter then to Romeo
bored clerk is on the other end of the line
The priest's letter is on the counter beside him
could not sent it - here it is again
Father Laurence is worried
By my brotherhood, unhappy fortune
The letter was of dear import
(: the priest listens) Adieu
He hangs up the receiver and looks at the wall clock
(
) Now must  to the monument alone
Within this hour will fair Juliet awake
: The clock to
'
:  cat skitters across a stained formica table
: The Apothecary's apartment is filled with cats
Dozens of feline eyes glow in the dim room
Romeo stands nervously
The Apothecary extracts a small chemist's vial from inside a 'Statue of Our Lady' table lamp - he now speaks with cool professionalism
Drink it off and if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight
Romeo takes the vial and hands over the money
There is my gold - worse poison to men's souls Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell
'
Motor running, Balthasar waits in the alley outside the apartment building
He checks the rear view mirror and freezes
At the end of the alleyway a police car crawls to a halt
Romeo exits the building, and as he does so, the streetlight catches his face
The Cop's and Romeo's eyes meet
: The cop
This is that banished haughty Montague
'
Balthasar cracks; he guns the engine and the car lurches forward
Tires screech as Romeo dives into the passenger seat of Balthasar's moving vehicle
Siren blaring, the police car gives chase
Balthasar's car winds through traffic - the patrol car gaining
police car -turns over a median strip
'
:  rusted brown hood
The tortured engine screams as Balthasar negotiates the speeding car through city traffic
: Red and blue police light approach fast
Captain Prince barrels through the corridors of police headquarters pulling on his flying jacket
:  smoking tire as it lays rubber to the asphalt
Balthasar grits his teeth as he weaves the car through the impossibly tight space between a container truck and a bus
: The patrol car is almost upon them when
in a seemingly suicidal manoeuvre Balthasar throws his car into a right-angle turn across four lanes of oncoming traffic
Horns blare
:  skidding, squealing, out of control sedan, braking to avoid collision
Miraculously, Balthasar's vehicle shoots out of it its path and onto the other side of the roadway
The sedan slams into the following patrol car
Balthasar's car speeds into the driveway of the Verona Beach Eternal Rest Cemetery
Captain Prince scans the night time city below
He speaks to the pilot and the chopper banks sharply
:  stone angel etched against the night sky
: Romeo pulls a crowbar from the trunk of the parked car
Police sirens sound in the distance
Romeo eyes Balthasar intently
Upon thy life, whatever thou Or seest, stand all aloof
Give me the light - Balthasar stands motionless - Romeo rips the torch from his hands and strides into the cemetery
Balthasar follows
do beseech you
Romeo turns, punching Balthasar hard; he goes down, blood spurting from his nose
Do not interrupt me in my course or By heaven  will tear thee joint by And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs
Balthasar slowly rises
Both boys are trying hard not to cry
(
) The time and my intents are savage wild, More fierce and more inexorable far Than empty tigers or the roaring sea
will be gone and not trouble ye
Romeo smiles
So shalt thou show me friendship
They embrace as Romeo whispers
(
) Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow
:  crowbar wrenches at ornate glass and iron doors
: The Gothic structure of the mausoleum rears against the night sky
Romeo frenziedly attacks the gates of the small side chapel
Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death, Thus  enforce thy rotten jaws to open
With a final heave the doors scrape open
Silence
'
: An endless marble corridor lit by hundreds of tiny flickering eternal flames
: Romeo
He murmurs: In despite 'll cram thee with more food
Suddenly a hurricane wind and whirr of machinery: like a huge black insect, Captain Prince's chopper swoops down over the mausoleum
Romeo is caught in the glare of the chopper's burning arc light
Sirens scream, police units race through the cemetery
Blinded, Romeo fires wildly toward the chopper
The police cars screech to a halt
:  police marksman in the chopper
His finger squeezes the rifle trigger
bullet slams into Romeo's shoulder
The other cops open fire and Romeo is sent reeling backwards into the mausoleum in a fusillade of bullets
An angry Captain Prince bellows into the radio
Hold
Hold
The police hold their fire
Bleeding from the shoulder wound, Romeo drags shut the heavy double doors of the chapel
He bangs off three shots through a pane of broken glass and screams at the police
Stand all aloof
Outside the chopper hovers
Police take up siege positions
Captain Prince's voice echoes through the bullhorn
Romeo, come forth, come forth
Romeo uses the crowbar to wedge the doors shut
He bangs off another shot as he yells out at the Police
Tempt not a desperate man
Romeo waits
There is no response from the cops
As the chopper settles to earth, Captain Prince speaks into the radio
Bring forth these enemies Montague and Capulet
'
Orange rescue lights reflect through the windshield of the priest's car as it crawls past the crashed sedan and police vehicle
Father Laurence thumps the steering wheel in frustration
Saint Francis be my speed tonight
Across the road Police swarm around the entrance to the cemetery
Fear comes upon me
, much  fear some ill unthrifty thing
: The green glow of the car clock as the seconds pulse away
: Down the marble corridor lit by the eternal flames
: Romeo
He weakly stands at the entrance to the viewing chapel
The chapel is dark
As Romeo's eyes adjust he can just see, picked out by a shaft of blue moonlight, the glowing figure of a sleeping girl
He moves down the aisle past the tombs of long-dead Capulets
Romeo is close now
He halts as if in the presence of an unbelievable vision
He lights a match and the room glows gold
The warm light reveals a Juliet even more beautiful in seeming death
Romeo lights some of the hundreds of candles that surround her
my love, my wife, Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath, Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty, Thou art not conquered
Beauty's ensign yet Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, And death's pale flag is not advanced there
Romeo kneels close, as if not wanting to wake a sleeping child
Unconscious tears fall from his eyes as he whispers
(
) Ah, dear Juliet, why art thou yet so fair
Shall  believe that unsubstantial Is amorous and keeps thee here in To be his paramour
For fear of still will stay with thee
Here, oh here Will  set up my everlasting rest And shake the yoke of inauspicious From this world-wearied flesh
He lays himself close
(
) Eyes, look your last
Arms, take your last embrace
And, lips,  you The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
Gently Romeo kisses Juliet's lips
Ever so slightly, Juliet's hand moves - Romeo does not notice
(
) dateless bargain to engrossing death
Romeo drinks from the vial; the power of the compound is immediate
He convulses and falls, his head resting on Juliet
(
) (fighting for breath) true apothecary, thy drugs are quick
Behind Romeo's head we can see Juliet's eyes opening
Romeo sucks the last few breaths of life into his lungs
Through a blurry consciousness Juliet becomes aware of Romeo
Oh Romeo, what's here
Forcing herself up, she cradles his head in her arms
Romeo's clear wide eyes stare back, he is completely still but for the sound of weak breaths desperately drawn across motionless lips
Juliet finds the vial clenched in Romeo's hand
Tears slip from her eyes
(
) Drunk all, and left No friendly drop to help me after
will kiss thy lips
Haply some poison yet doth hang on To make me die with a restorative
She delicately kisses Romeo's lips
(
) (a heart-broken whisper) Thy lips are warm
Desperately the lovers cling to each other
With all his desire to stay alive, Romeo whispers: Thus with a kiss  die
There is no breath
He is still
Silence
Sobbing, Juliet hugs the lifeless Romeo to her
Romeo
' my true love Romeo
She looks to the gun in his hand
: Quickly past Captain Prince and the Capulets taking cover behind a patrol car
Two police officers urgently convey Montague and his wife toward them
Discover Father Laurence arriving
: Father Laurence's
: Patrol cars, lights flashing, surround the mausoleum
He sees, through the open door of a police car, a hand- cuffed youth
It is Balthasar
Father Laurence hurries to him
It is dawning on Father Laurence
Balthasar
() brought news of Juliet's death
And then in post came Romeo from To this same place
to this same monument
: Father Laurence
How long hath he been there
Full half an hour
Father Laurence turns towards the mausoleum
Romeo
(a shock of realisation) The lady stirs
: Juliet: Sobbing uncontrollably she prises the gun from Romeo's hand
Father Laurence, desperate, breaks through the police line and runs toward the mausoleum
: The parents and Captain Prince
Hold
Go not forth
Juliet turns the gun on herself
: Father Laurence, he screams as he mounts the mausoleum stairs
The lady stirs
The sound of a single gun shot rips through the night
: Captain Prince
: The parents, a look of cold shock
: The priest - his cry echoes through the night
Juliet lies peacefully on Romeo's chest
Her eyes awake wash of deep red blood floods across them both
As we move away from the forms of the two young lovers lit by a ring of candles, the police burst in, guns ready to resolve what has already been resolved
Continuing up, we pass through the glass dome of the viewing chapel, and over the building
There, huddled at the base of the Mausoleum steps, are the Montague and Capulet parents and Father Laurence
From high up we see Captain Prince emerge from the Mausoleum and speak to the group
moment, then their cries float gently up
We are travelling high into the sky now
The cries of the parents and the buzz of radio calls fade to nothing
-  -
As the sun struggled to rise, we push toward the figure of Jesus silently surveying the city
-
As Jesus' face fills the screen, droplets of water begin to streak his cheeks
: Music swells; the droplets grow to a torrent, and a heavy rain begins to fall
For a long beat, we stay with this image
: From the Jesus
sea of black umbrellas stretches back from the steps of Freedom Tower
At the top of the steps are a pair of flower strewn caskets
Before the caskets stand Fulgencia and Gloria Capulet, and Ted and Caroline Montague
They stare with blank, uncomprehending sorrow
Among the crowd we see the distraught faces of Benvolio, Balthasar, Father Laurence and the Nurse
The caskets are gently slid into a pair of long black cars
Montague and Capulet descend the stairs
Captain Prince blocks their path
He holds them in his gaze
See what a scourge is laid upon your hate, That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love; And , for winking at your discords too, Have lost a brace of kinsmen
All are punished
The Prince steps aside
The procession moves off
Montague and Capulet look to one another, a moment, and then the two adversaries together follow the bodies of their dead children
: The rain falls
Two black cars lead the people of Verona Beach in a sorrowful parade
As the cars pass beneath the towering effigy of Jesus, the image pixilates into a television picture
:   anchor woman watches the image on a studio monitor
She turns: (to camera) glooming peace this morning with it brings: The sun for sorrow will not show his head
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things
Some shall be pardoned, and some punished, For never was a story of more woe Than this of Juliet and her Romeo
The anchor woman changes beat to the next story; but her dialogue fades, and her image gets smaller as the television recedes into a black distance
The music that reminds us most of these two lost lives swells
When the television is very small it is switched off
