Written by Brad Mirman First Draft, March 1996 : - Pitch dark
We hear two men speaking  in hushed voices
: All dialogue is in French until otherwise noted
(whispering) Turn on the flashlight
'm trying
It doesn't work
It has to work
You just bought it this afternoon
beat
Do they come with batteries
You didn't buy batteries
thought they came with batteries
can't believe you didn't check
bought everything you put on the list
Gloves
Pen knives
Flashlight
Batteries were not on the list
Why should  have to put it on the list
It's like saying to buy a car with tires
-- wealthy neighborhood of Paris off the Champs Elysees
Large homes line the secluded street
We see the silhouette of a man in a Peugeot
We   closer to see  , 30's, waits nervously
-- Dark
lights his Zippo lighter
He is late 30's, tall, handsome with eyes that seem to twinkle in the glow of the flame
Beside him is  , 30's, hyper
Daniel places the  on a small table and moves over to a  on the wall
Daniel stops at one, removes a pen knife and starts to cut the canvas from the frame
Daniel rolls up the canvas
2
Let's go
Julien starts to pick up the
Be careful it's
Too Late
Julien has already picked it up
It burns his hand ans he flicks it away
It flies through the air and lands in the corner of the room
The  catch on fire
hot
Julien panics
He grabs the canvas out of Daniel's hand and begins beating the flames with it
Daniel looks at him with disbelief
Julien flails his arms wildly as he beats back the flames
He turns to Daniel pleased that his efforts have extinguished the fire, but unaware that the canvas has now caught on fire
beat
Julien sees the flames and puts them out
Daniel just stares at him
He opens the canvas
The painting is ruined
-- Mercedes parks in front of the Peugeot, boxing it in between it and a car behind it
The  gets out and walks away
-- Daniel and Julien move through the darkness
Light your lighter
can't see anything
and try not to burn down the house
Julien remove a lighter and presses it
The entire room fills with light
Julien stares at the flame amazed
' Don't move
They turn to see an old man standing at the top of the stairs in his bathrobe
He is frail, his face pasty white
He is holding a very long, double-barrel shotgun
Julien looks to Daniel with a 'what now' expression
The old man slowly moves down the stairs
He loses his balance and falls down the stairs, tumbling head over heals until he reaches the bottom
Daniel and Julien stare at the old man who is sprawled out on the floor, motionless
Is he dead
don't know
He looks dead
3
He looked dead before he fell
The old man groans, then opens his eyes
He grabs his shotgun
Daniel and Julien run to the door
-- Daniel and Julien run towards the street
Start the car
Start the car
Raymond starts the engine
Daniel and Julien rush across the street and get in the back seat
Raymond tries to pull out but there are only a few inches between the Mercedes in front and the car behind
Like a pinball stuck between two bumpers the Peugeot jerks rapidly back and forth
-- Daniel and Julien stare angrily ar Raymond
You didn't think to move the car before we came out
Daniel looks out his window and sees
'  -- the old man runs out of his house with his shotgun and heads towards the car
Raymond is desperately trying to get the car free
They all slide down as the old man fires
The windows on the left side of the car shatter
Raymond, get us out of here
Raymond pops up and returns to getting the car out as the old man opens the breach of the shotgun to reload
Raymond floors the Peugeot keeping his foot on the brake
The engine revs
He turns the wheel to the left and releases the brake
The Peugeot juts forward smashing into the rear of the Mercedes and pushing in out into the street
Before the old man can take aim the Peugeot is speeding down the street
--  -- Raymond bites his lip nervously as he drives
Julien finds the whole thing amusing
Daniel leans forward
(to Raymond) You know what makes a good get away driver
(More) 4
(Cont'd) (controlled anger) Being able to get away
You're always pointing out my negative qualities
My analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people
Fine
Raymond, we'd like to commend you on how well you fucked up tonight
,  -- narrow street
Daniel carries the cardboard tube as he walks with Julien and Raymond
They enter a
'  -- Two large desks are lined up face to face
One is empty
The other is occupied by  , 40's, all business
Off to the side is  , 40's
Daniel, Julien and Raymond enter
As they approach the desk Daniel glances at Marcel who is staring at him
(amused) heard you almost got your ass blown off last night
Some thief
regular black panther
Marcel glances at Bastaldi to see if he appreciates his comments
Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties, Marcel
think you're referring to The Pink Panther
Pink panther, black panther
Who gives a shit
And  don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd
There's no reason to be abusive
You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism
What the hell is he talking about
'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly
5
How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick
Shut up
Both of you
You're giving me a fuckin' headache
beat
Raymond and Marcel stare at one another
We  a muffled in the b
g
Where's your brother
Vincent's in the States on business
(a beat; referring to the painting) That it
Daniel lays the cardboard tube containing the painting on the desk
Bastaldi removes the painting
To him it is not a work of art, just a commodity to be sold
He opens his desk drawer, removes several large stacks of money and hands them to Daniel
Okay
Now 've got something  want to -- We  the groaning sound again
Bastaldi looks irritated
He gets up and walks over to a closet
He opens to the doors to reveal a man in his underwear, his wrists tied behind his back, his mouth taped shut
wire noose is around his neck forcing him to stand on his tip toes to avoid hanging himself
Do you mind
'm trying to do some business here
The man looks at Bastaldi through pleading eyes and mumbles something
One more sound out of you and 'm going to cut your fuckin' tongue out
Bastaldi closes the door
Daniel looks at him inquisitively
You take someone in
Give them a steady job and how do they repay you
By claiming to misplace a shipment of your merchandise
Maybe he did misplace it
You misplace your car keys
You misplace your cell phone
(More) 6
(Cont'd) You do not misplace one hundred and forty seven wide-screen 's
Laurant, how long has he been in there
Bastaldi looks puzzled
don't know
What day is today
Thursday
Is it Thursday already
This week has just shot by
Bastaldi thinks about something for a moment, then
You and your crew speak English, don't you
Daniel is still staring at the closet
Hey Daniel
Hello
(snaps his fingers) Do you guys speak English
Uh, yeah
Good
have a job for you in America
Bastaldi tosses a photo of a middle-aged American couple
He points to a diamond necklace around the woman's neck
The Taylors from Chicago
Very rich
An acquaintance of mine recently quit working for Mrs
Taylor as an assistant
She tells me they keep all their jewelry in a safe in their bedroom
It seems like a long way to go for a necklace
Besides, we don't know the city and-- (overlapping) Mr
Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go
(More) 7
(Cont'd) He's telling you you're going
And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go
Thank you Marcel, for that
extremely redundant explanation
'mon, Laurant, America
The job is worth about two million euros
Pull this off and you and your crew could make some real money, Daniel
You leave tomorrow
They know they don't have a choice
We're going to need to find someone who knows the city
know someone
-- The plaza is filled with tourists
Moving through the crowd is , Algerian, late 20's, a small time street hustler, dressed in jeans and a " Love Paris" tee-shirt
He passes a who is about to take a picture and lifts his wallet
Sami moves on
He sees two overweight women standing at a vendor's cart, holding a large wad of
The woman puts the cash back in her purse, but does not zip it up
Sami moves in behind her and slips his hand into the purse
She zips the bag closed
Sami's face fills with pain as the zipper catches the hair of his arm
The women walk towards the cathedral
Sami has no choice but follow after them
He tries to match their pace so he doesn't alert them of his presence
The woman looks back and sees Sami's hand
She pulls her bag away, ripping a section of hair off his arm, then swings the bag, putting all of her weight behind it
It hits Sami squarely in the face
He lands on his back with a thud
and fly out from every one of his pockets
He staggers to his feet and starts to pick up the wallets when he sees
--   :    of two police officers moving towards him
He knows he has no more time
He takes off running, disappearing into the crowd
8
--   -- Sami is at the bar
He sees Marcel enter and runs towards the back
Standing in his way is one of Marcel's
Sami turns around as Marcel approaches and forces a smile
:   All dialogue is now in English unless otherwise noted
Going somewhere
Oh, Marcel
thought you were somebody else
If  knew it was you  would have never run
long, awkward beat as Marcel just glares at him
You're probably here for the money  owe you
(off Marcel's nod) don't have it
Marcel opens the door to the bathroom and pushes Sami inside
--  -- Marcel closes the door
He is face to face with Sami
You know this is how rumors get started
Marcel punches Sami in the stomach
He drops to his knees beat
The door to the bathroom opens and the   peers inside
He stares awkwardly at what he perceives as the beginning of a sexual act
Told you
Marcel slams the door then grabs Sami by the ear and yanks him to his feet
Today's your lucky day, Sami
(breathlessly) Yeah,  can see that
Normally 'd be breaking your fingers right now, but 'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself
We have a group going to Chicago to do a job
You're going with them
9
Me
You lived there
You know the city
've still got a few legal problems back in the States
Marcel glares at him
(nervously) But 'd be
'd be happy to go
Marcel stares at him with hard expression
If you try to leave town 'll know
If you manage to leave town 'll find you
and the next time we meet in a bathroom 'll be cutting you up into little pieces
He hands Sami a piece of paper
Be at this address at nine o'clock tomorrow morning
-- Daniel sits with Julien
At the end of the bar Raymond is on the pay phone
(in French) Yes, Mama
Yes,  have my vitamins have everything
Of course 'm coming back
'm not leaving you
'm only going to be gone a few days
'll call you when  get there
Okay
've got to go now
(listens) Mama, 've got to go
(listens) No, 'm not yelling
Sami enters and walks over to Daniel and Julien
'm Sami
Marcel sent me
What is it you do, Sami
10
You know, a little of this, a little of that
've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams
Right now 'm into pick-pocketing
see
master criminal
Hey,  was told to come here by Marcel
You guys don't want me, 'll be more than happy to leave
The door opens
enters
No one knows his last name
He is 40's, blonde hair, leather jacket, black pants
Looks more like a rock-star than a criminal
His eyes are flat and there is an intensity about him that is unnerving
Zero casually nods to Daniel
Zero stares at Sami as Daniel leads him over
(to Sami) This is Zero
Hi
'm one and this is two, three, four and five
Sami laughs at his little joke
The others cringe
One look in Zero's eyes tells Sami what everyone else already knows: This is not someone to fuck with
Julien puts his arm around Sami and leads him away from the others
Let me give you some advice
You don't want to piss him off because he'll kill you for the fun of it
What you want to do is keep your mouth shut and do what we tell you
(in French) So, we are going to America
In English
Sami doesn't speak French
Where are you from
Algeria
And you don't speak French
11
Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French
It's a matter of what school you went too
Me  never really -- (overlapping) -- Zero isn't interested in your life story
(to Daniel) Who gets killed
Hopefully no one
(confused) No one
Then why is Zero here
Sami leans over to Raymond
He speaks about himself in the third person
Feel free to correct him if you want
(to Zero) just want you there in case there's trouble
And if there is, then Zero can kill someone
We'll see
-- Daniel and the others step out carrying their suitcases
The door to a limousine opens and Marcel gets out
The scene is in
(to Daniel) thought  would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage
and tell you that Marcel will be going with you
What
This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel
The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you
12
You don't trust me
don't trust anyone
You don't get to the top of this game by trusting people
and after all, you are a thief
It's in your nature to steal
'm just protecting my investment
--  -- For many of them this is the first time they have ever been inside a limo
Julien pours himself a drink
Sami plays around with the air conditioner
Zero turns on the radio and clicks through a few stations until he comes to  singing "Des que le vent souffera
" He leans back in his seat, bobbing his head to the music
Marcel doesn't like it
He changes the station
We hear   singing, "Que je taime
" That's better
Zero doesn't like it
He pushes the button returning to the Renaud song and stares at Marcel
Marcel, not to be outdone returns the Hallyday song
Like two children they click the buttons of the radio, switching back and forth between Renaud and Hallyday
Bastaldi has had enough
Stop it
Both of you
He turns off the radio
long beat
Marcel, like a child who has to have the last word starts singing to himself quietly, but loud enough for Zero to hear
(singing) que je t'aime
que je
Marcel sees Bastaldi glaring at him and stops
'  -- Daniel and the crew get into a mini-van taxi
-- Quick cuts of the familiar sights of the city
The Sears building
Chicago board of trade building
Grant park
Then with each successive cut the beauty of the city seems to fade until we are in
13
-- An industrial section of the city
Empty streets
Run down buildings
Graffiti filled walls and burnt out hulls of abandoned cars line the street
The taxi driver leans out his window
Are you sure you guys have the right address
This ain't no tourist area
Marcel looks at a piece of paper he is holding
Yes
We are sure
The taxi speeds off, leaving them standing on the sidewalk, their bags in a pile
Suddenly, from out of nowhere three appear and walk over
Daniel looks behind him and sees another two approaching from the rear
Zero calmly sits down on one of the suitcases
Let me handle this
, 30's, the leader of the group steps forward
Hey, brother
What's happening, man
Sami raises his hand as if to greet Lamar
Don't you brother me, motherfucker
Sami looks like an idiot with his hand up in the air
He casually lowers it
Lamar looks over the group and grins
What's in the bags
Dirty underwear
Lamar forces a laugh
Dirty underwear
That's a good one
Let me explain something to you
This is my street and you're gonna give me want  what or 'm gonna bust your heads open
Raymond steps forward and places his hand on Lamar's arm
Lamar, violence is never an answer to settling disputes
can see you have a lot of anger
but this is not the way to get it out
14
Get outta my face
Lamar removes a knife
The others in his group bring out an assortment of clubs, chains and pipes
Now, are you going to give me the suitcases
Or are we going to have to take them
Zero is still sitting on one of the suitcases
Va te faire foutre
What did he say
He said to go fuck yourself
We are tired and bored with your bullshit
So, put that stupid little knife away before Zero shoves it up your ass
Who is Zero
He is
(to Julien) He speaks about himself in the third person
Julien shrugs his shoulders
Maybe Zero would like to get off his ass and take my knife from me
If you insist
Zero stands up and raises his hand
He is holding a
9mm Glock
He aims it at Lamar's head
Lamar's brave exterior quickly fades now that he is looking down the barrel of the gun
The rest of his gang turns and runs away
Zero aims the gun at his groin
Leave now before Zero shoots off those little raisins you call balls
Lamar runs away
Daniel and the others smile at Zero as they pick up their bags and walk towards a building
15
Zero is left with Sami who stares at him with disbelief
You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs
How stupid is that
Zero did not put it in his bag
He put it in yours
Zero grins and walks away
-- The crew stands at a door
Marcel knocks
peep-hole in the door is opened and an eye looks them over
We are looking for Sophie
Laurant send us
The door is opened by  (the girl in the photo on Bastaldi's computer)
She is late 20's, beautiful
(softly) Ouh La La
'  -- An old building, the rooms are partitioned off by sheets hanging from the ceiling
The main area is an artists workspace where large abstract paintings lean against the wall
wasn't expecting this many of you
've got a few sleeping bags you can use
Thanks
Of to the side, sitting on the couch is , 20's, a burn-out with long hair and a scraggly goatee
His face is buried in a bong as he sucks in a lung full of marijuana
He watches a cartoon show on the television
(to all of them) This is Wayne
My roommate
Raymond walks over to him
am Raymond
Thank you for allowing us to stay here
16
No problem, man
(offers him the bong) Hey, you wanna hit
No thank you
Raymond looks at the television and sees a cartoon show
Oh, Pepe Le Pew
He is very funny and quite well known in France
Yeah,  dig him
Although a cartoon  feel he shares a universal theme: We are all searching for love
No
Wayne stares at him with a dead pan expression as he tries to assemble a coherent thought
Whoa
That's deep
You guys hungry
-- Because of the hour the room is not crowded
Only a few sit at the counter sipping coffee
, 50's, bee hive hair style, face covered in make up arrives at the table
Ready to order
Julien looks up at her
Could we see a wine list please
(smirks) That's cute
They don't have a wine list
Oh, then we will have the house wine
Sure -- and would you like that before your escargot in white truffle sauce
17
did not order escargot
They don't serve wine here
What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine
This kind
Okay
will have a beer
don't think he's grasping the concept
Iced tea, lemonade, coca cola, sprite or root beer
(to the others) 'est quoi root beer
He'll have a sprite
We'll all have sprite
Good
Now that we've gotten the beverage selection out of the way, dare we move on to the main course
Idiot
Zero grins as he puts a cigarette in his mouth
The waitress pulls it out of his mouth
And no smoking
(in French) No smoking
No drinking
What kind of country is this
: '
, 40's, not the brightest bulb on the tree
His head snaps back as someone punches him in the face
Blood flows from his nose
We are in
18
-- Two  stand on each side of Vinny
They are  " " 40's, could have a second career as a Sumo Wrestler " ", 30's, thin a rail
They make a strange pair but they both have one thing in common: They are stone cold killers
Standing in front of the them is  , 30's, a wise guy, tough as they come
He wears a well tailored suit, black leather gloves and polished shoes
(frightened) 'm sorry, Frankie
Really
Vinny gets off his knees and moves towards Zammito
You bleed on me, 'll kill ya
Vinny takes a step back
What'd  tell you
Huh, Vinny
What'd tell you when you came to me for money
Didn't  ask you not to do it
Did not say that
(to Joey) What'd  say to him
" " You said don't do it, boss
That's right
said don't do it
Did you listen to me
No
You wanted the money
So,  lent you twenty large
Now it's been three weeks and you ain't paid a dime
What do you think that makes me look like on the street don't do something to you and everyone will think they can skate
Frankie,  -- -- Shut up
Don't you try to make me feel bad about this
You knew what would happen to you if you didn't pay
This is on your head, not mine
(to Joey and Nicky) Break his arm
Vinny looks up at Zammito through pleading eyes
Jesus, Frankie, 'm your brother
19
That's why we're only breaking one arm
--  -- The table is littered with plates
Sophie has sketched out a diagram of a house on her napkin
There's an exterior alarm system
There's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector
The control panel is in the bedroom
can handle the exterior alarm, but the one in the bedroom is a problem
After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window
(impressed) Good
Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector
The rest of us will come in through the front door
What about transportation
You can use my car
Not a good idea
Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you
Raymond, you'll steal one
No problem
When do we go
Tonight
Tonight
know they won't be home tonight
You ever hear of jet lag
20
Take a nap
'  -- As they crew and Sophie approach the door we hear the muted roar of loud
'  -- As the enter the music is even louder
The bass pounds through the walls
Wayne seems oblivious to it as he sits on the couch smoking a joint
What the hell is that
Neighbors
They do this all the time
can't even hear myself think
How are we supposed to sleep with this noise
've asked them a hundred times to keep in down
They don't listen
will talk to them
Sophie and Wayne both find his offer amusing
Yeah
Right
Not a good idea
It's just a matter of communication
Raymond leaves
-- Raymond walks towards a door at the end of the building
The grows louder
He  on the door and waits
It is opened by a very large man
a biker type, leather jacket, full beard, several long earrings hanging from his ear
He is holding a
Behind him are two other rough-looking men
21
(cheerfully; loudly over the music) Hello
My name is Raymond
am visiting next door and  was wondering if you could make your music a little less loud
The Biker takes a sip of his beer
No
But the music is very-- Before Raymond can finish his sentence the Biker pours his beer over Raymond's head
Fuck off
He slams the door in Raymond's face
'  --   -- The music continues to pound through the walls
soggy Raymond steps into the room
He walks over to a chair and sits down, his head hung down, embarrassed
Marcel is angered by this
He glances over to Daniel who subtly nods to him
Marcel leaves the room
--   -- Marcel walks purposefully along the side of the building
He reaches into his jacket pocket and removes two black leather gloves
He slips them on as he approaches the door, then knocks
beat
The Biker opens the door
Listen asshole,  told you -- Marcel head butts him, slamming his forehead into the bridge of his nose
The Biker clasps his hands over his bleeding nose
Marcel grabs him by the hair and rapidly punches him in face several times -- each punch backing the Biker into the room
'  -- On the last punch the Biker falls backwards crashing through a large glass coffee table
#2 moves in behind Marcel and throws a hard punch as Marcel turns around
Marcel bends his head down, so that his attackers fists slams into the hard crown of his skull
#2 painfully grabs his broken knuckles
Marcel knees him hard in the groin
#2 turns to his side and doubles over
Marcel kicks the man into the back of his knee spinning him around and down on his knees
22
In a fluid movement he elbows the man in the back of head #2 falls face forwards and is out cold
Marcel turns to the third  who is standing by the stereo
He is smaller than the others and has seen enough
He quickly turns off the power
'  --   -- Marcel enters
Wayne is on the couch with Raymond
(impressed) What'd you say to them
(dryly) Nothing
-- plain looking building in an old neighborhood of the city
- '  -- Zammito sits at his desk
Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" sit on the couch
Bobby Beans balding, stocky enters
Hey, Bobby beans
How you doin'
He walks up to Zammito and they kiss each other on the cheek
Good
'm doing good
How you doin', Frankie
Good
'm good
Mr
Maranzano sends his warmest regards
When you return please extend my regards to Mr
Maranzano and his family
Zammito motions for Bobby to sit down
Can  offer you something
drink
Coffee
No thank you
23
You sure
just got a shipment of espresso from Sicily
Special blend
Can't find anything like it in the States
'm good
Really
Okay
understand you're interested in one of our properties
Yeah
That warehouse over on Merchant Street
The volume on our import business has risen dramatically
The proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the -- (overlapping) -- Super what
Supernumerary
It means better than expected
Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected
Everybody knows what better than expected means
'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills
Okay
How much
'm not here to negotiate
Why are you here
To tell you that we're interested in the property
You told me that on the phone
What the hell are you doing here
Showing off your communication skills
Go back to your people and tell them when they're serious to put a number on the table
will relay the particulars of our conversation to Mr
Maranzano
24
Yeah -- you do that
Bobby Beans leaves
Jerk-wad
Zammito looks over at Joey and Nicky
How's my brother
" " He's over at St
James
They had to put two pins in his arm
said a clean break
" " Hey boss, it's not a science
Send some flowers
Something nice
Roses or carnations
And one of those get well soon cards
Nicky gets up to carry out his instructions
Oh and uh, send a case of steaks over to his house
don't want the kids to go hungry while he's recuperating
'  --  -- Julien and Zero are playing cards at the back of the room
Sami sitting by himself sorting through a    filled with shoes
Sophie joins him
Sami pulls another pair of shoes out of the canvas bag
You like shoes
No,  like the bag
It would be good for the job tonight
It belongs to Vincent Bastaldi
He left it last time he was here
'm sure he wouldn't mind if you used it
Sami dumps the rest of the shoes out of the bag
So, how did you get hooked up with these guys
25
Just lucky  guess
How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's
The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet
needed some way to pay the rent
Laurant and Vincent pay well for information
So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed
They're not nice people
She sees a  on Sami's arm
It's a heart with someone's faded name
like your tattoo
Sami is suddenly self-conscious of it
She traces along the letters with her finger
(reading the name) Casandra
Old girlfriend
Something like that
Did she break your heart
Something like that
It looks old
Did you get it a long time ago
You ask a lot of questions
That's how you get to know someone
Did it hurt when you got it
don't remember
was drunk
You got it in a bar
No
got it in prison
went in for three years
When  came out she was married to my best friend
Happy
26
Sorry
didn't mean to pry
It's okay
It was a long time ago
've been thinking about getting tattoo
You know, a flower or something
On my ass
Sami looks at her quizzically
Who's gonna see it there
The lucky ones
She smiles flirtatiously and walks away
-- car drives up
We can only see the outline of an old Chevy Impala
Two men get out of the car, leaving the engine running as they head for the liquor store
Across the street Raymond is checking out a Buick LaSabre, but stops when he sees the flashing alarm light on the dashboard
He looks across the street and sees the Impala
-- An   is behind the counter
Two masked men enter with guns and rush up to the counter
Gimme the money
The old man opens the cash register and hands him all the bills
Open the safe
don't have the combination
Raphael pistol whips him with his gun and drags him half way over the counter, then presses his gun to the old man's head
swear
don't have it
Raphael pushes him to the floor
He runs out of the store with the others
27
-- They run out and remove their masks
, 20's, Latin, tough, shaved head, neck covered with tattoos
, Latin, small, cubby, stops and stares at something with confusion
Hey, Vato, where's your car
Raphael stops as he sees the street is empty
My car
Hector has to grab Raphael who is too stunned to move and drag him down the street
'  -- The crew gets ready
On the table a variety of gear is laid out
Cells phones, electronic devices, all the tools of the trade
Sami throws some items into the black canvas bag
cell phone rings
Julien answers it
It's Raymond
He's outside with the car
They grab their gear and head for the door
Sophie leans over and kisses Sami on the cheek
He stares at her, half surprised, half embarrassed
For luck
, '  -- The crew steps out to find Raymond in the
We can see it clearer now
It's a low rider car
Bright orange flames are painted on the side, wire wheels and chrome exhaust pipes
'm glad you didn't get something flashy
Watch this
Raymond pushes a button and the hydraulics make the car bounce up and down
Sami rolls his eyes as the others get into the car
-- Lamar is standing in the shadows with one of his friends, watching
--  -- The six of them are crammed into the car as it moves down the street
Julien studies a map
28
'  -- Raphael sits on the couch
He can barely contain his anger
He looks up slowly, his jaw clenched
Hector sits across from him with a few other
Maybe you should call the police
Hey, idiot -- 've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car
just thought that-- (overlapping) -- Don't think
Okay
You're not good at it
The other Gang Bangers laugh at Hector
Go do something -- get some beers for the guys
Hector slinks out of the room
Raphael's face hardens
When  find out who did this 'm going to mount their head on my dashboard
-- family operation
Checkerboard table clothes
Candles burning in Chianti bottles
On the stereo   sings "Angela Mia"
Zammito waits at a table
His cell phone rings
(into phone) Yeah
(
) Mr
wants to see you
Now
've got a date with a drop dead major babe
(
) 'll tell him that
Zammito thinks it over
Okay
'm coming
He walks over to the , the  of the restaurant
29
Mario,  gotta go
When my date arrives tell her  had an emergency
Of course, Mr
Zammito
-- The Impala is stopped in the parking lot
(
) think we went the wrong way
(
) Oh, you think
(
) The map said to go left
(
) Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right
(
) (amused) Oh yeah
' ,  -- Zammito enters to find  , 60's, powerful, head of the Chicago Mob
He is smoking a cigar with a glass of brandy
Frankie, come in
Good to see you
You want something
No, 'm good, Angelo
Bonanno motions to the couch
Zammito sits down
understand Bobby Beans came to see you today
Yeah
Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse
And
And nothing
He's just feeling us out
30
He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory
He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off
Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property
heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary
Bonanno stares at him
They're gonna be what
Supernumerary
It means better than expected
Good word
Half Tooth Tony, 30's, built like a tank step into the room
He has the face of a boxer, several of his teeth are chipped or broken
Mr
Bonanno,  just wanted to remind you that you have an appointment in ten minutes
Half Tooth Tony leaves
Someone else coming
Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes
You ever watch it
Uh, no -- You should
You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that
Very informative
Stay and watch it with me
You know, 'm kind of tired
'm just gonna go home if it's all the same to you
31
Bonanno affectionately slaps Zammito's cheeks
Go
Rest
Bonanno takes a sip of his brandy, but his eyes stay on Zammito
Oh Frankie, what's this  hear about your brother
He missed three weeks
Your own brother
You couldn't send someone else to do it
did
Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed
But you were there
Angelo, we live and die by the rules we make
We are men of honor, but honor without respect is a
horse-less carriage
long beat
Bonanno thinks about what he said, not sure what to make of it, then
What the fuck does that mean
-- The Impala is by the pumps
Sami leans out the window holding the map as he speaks with the station attendant
-- An upscale neighborhood
Expensive homes line the wooded street
The Impala stops and the crew gets out
(to Raymond) Park on the next street over
We'll meet you when we're done
'  -- Julien attaches a device to the alarm panel
series of numbers flash by as the computer cracks the code
One by one, the numbers stop until the entry code is displayed on the screen
He enters the numbers on the alarm and nods to the others
32
Julien and Zero move around to the side of the house as Daniel, Sami and Marcel wait in the shadows
' ,    -- Julien places a retractable ladder against the wall and climbs up
He pries open the window and climbs in
Zero follows
' ,  -- Dark
Julien makes his way to the door and repeats the process with another alarm panel
Zero sits on the corner of the bed and waits patiently
Julien turns off the hall alarm and nods to Zero
Zero speed dials a number on his cell phone
We're in
'  -- Daniel uses a locksmith tool and quickly pries the lock out of the door
They go inside
'  -- Julien and Zero wait for them
We hear a toilet flush
The door to the bathroom opens and a man steps out
In an instant Julien and Zero jump him
The others enter and quickly join in to subdue the man
-- Raymond waits in the Impala
He can't resist using the hydraulics, raising the car up and down
'  -- The lights are on
The room is an interior designers nightmare
Clashing colors, zebra skin bedspread
We move along Daniel, Sami, Marcel, Julien and Zero as they stare at something
-- Tied to a chair, his mouth taped shut, is a very angry Frankie Zammito
He yells, his voice muffled by the tape, but it's not hard to understand what he's saying
So much for no one being home
Julien goes to a bookcase and finds the safe
At least they got this right
He removes his tools and goes to work
Sami stares at Zammito with vague recognition, then turns to the others
33
We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here
Good idea
'll be Elvis and you-- (overlapping) --  want to be Elvis
It's my idea
(whining) 'mon,  look more like Elvis than you do
Okay
You can be Elvis
Marcel smiles happily
And the rest of us are
John, Paul, George and Ringo
Marcel sees an autographed baseball on the book shelf
Hey, Barry Bonds
The home run king
Marcel tosses the ball into the black canvas bag
Daniel stares at him
It's for my nephew
-- surveillance operation
Two  agents sit near the window small card table is littered with coffee cups , 40's, a hardened field agent, picks up a pair of binoculars and looks out the window
-   :    of Zammito tied to the chair and surrounded by the others
Looks like Zammito's being robbed
Should  call
34
Yeah, but tell them not to move until these morons come out of the house
'  -- From inside the safe we see Julien open the door
Daniel and Julien look inside
There are a several stacks of cash, envelopes and a small cardboard box
Julien starts removing everything and puts it into the bag canvas bag
Where are the jewels
There aren't any jewels
Marcel looks as surprised as they are
There has to be
'm telling you 've pulled out everything in the safe
There aren't any jewels
There must be half a million dollars here though
Marcel, we came here for jewels, remember
Sami moves closer to Zammito, studying his face
He moves over to the dresser where there are several photographs of Zammito with various famous people
Next to the photographs is a plaque that reads:
We can see the color drain from Sami's face
He glances over at Zammito whose eyes are locked on his
Sami grabs Daniel and Marcel and pulls them aside
(babbling nervously) We have a problem
Problem isn't the right word
Dilemma
No that really doesn't describe -- (flatly) Do you know who that is
Mr
Taylor
No, that's not Mr
Taylor
(sensing something bad is coming) It's not
35
That's Frankie Zammito
The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia
(confused) Why would they want us to rob the Mafia
(screaming) '    ,  ' beat
The three of them turn and look at Zammito
The seriousness of the situation finally dawns on Marcel
He moves over to Zammito and rips the tape off his mouth
Mr
Zammito, there seems to have been a big mistake here
May  use your phone
Feel free
Marcel picks up the cordless phone and dials
: '  - Bastaldi removes a sleep mask and answers the phone
Hello
(
) (in French) It's Elvis
Who
(
) (in French) It's me
Marcel
: '  -- Marcel continues his conversation
(in French) Yes
(More) 36
(Cont'd) We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy
(
) (in French) You're there now
Oui
(in French) You're calling me on your cell phone, right
No
(
) (in French) You're calling me on is phone
Oui
(
) (in French) My number's going to show up on his bill
(In French) Should  call you back
We can hear Bastaldi sigh over the line
(
) (in French) You've already robbed the safe
Oui
(
) (in French) Take what you've got and get out of there
Bastaldi hangs up
The line goes dead
Walk out of here with nothing and 'll forget this ever happened
Yeah
Right
You're not a vendetta kind of guy
37
'll find you
No matter where you go 'll find you
You don't carry the same weight in France as you do here
Marcel whispers into Daniel's ear
You think it's smart to tell him we're French
think he's already figured that out
Zero who has been standing quietly by the window sees something across the street
flash
Light reflecting off glass
He takes a pair of night vision binoculars out of one of the bags and looks out the window
'  -- of Agent Hadley and the other  Agent watching him
We are being watched
Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks
Cops
They've been there for months
Think  don't know
Morons
Daniel closes the curtains
He tries to think
The crew huddles together in the corner, speaking softly so Zammito can't hear them
What do we do
was told to take what we have and go
Go where
The police are outside
Daniel looks at the others
If we do this we all have to agree
Marcel and Zero nod
Daniel looks to Julien who appears indecisive
don't know
Maybe if we did just leave -- 38
'mon, get real, will you
You think he's just going to forget about this
These guys are all about respect
All about honor
He's coming after us, so we might as well take the money
Julien nods
Sami walks over and grabs the black canvas bag
You're all dead
Zero grins then tapes his mouth closed again
-- The crew goes out the back door and climb over a fence
-- The crew arrives to find Raymond still playing with the hydraulics of the Impala
They get in
'  -- The Impala pulls into a driveway and goes to the rear of the building, out of view from the street
'   -- The crew waits as the door is unlocked
Wayne opens the door in a stoned haze
'  -- The crew places their equipment on the table
(
) Wayne, who is it
She enters and appears surprised to see them
wasn't expecting you guys back so fast
How'd it go
She quickly notices their angry expressions
How'd it go
don't know
Daniel, how would you say it went
would have to say
pretty fuckin' bad
You gave us the wrong address Sophie
39
No,  didn't
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes
Yes
And he gave it to us
145 Ridgeway Road
No
145 Ridgeroad Way
That moron
It was an honest mistake
Ridgeway
Ridgeroad
Ridgeway Road
Everyone get some sleep
We're leaving in the morning
-- Agent Hadley checks his watch
What the hell are they doing in there
Chicago
says they can't hold the units here any longer
They want to know if they should go in
Agent Hadley thinks a moment
Tell them no
We'll advise if anything changes
'  -- Zammito is still tied to his chair
-- of the cordless phone of his bed
He pushes with his feet, sliding the chair over to the bed, then starts rocking back and forth until he tips over forward, his face pressed against the mattress
Using his nose he turns on the phone and presses a speed dial number
40
-- Joey "Two Tons" is asleep in a sleeveless tee shirt
Next to him is his wife, her hair in curlers, her eyes covered by a black sleep mask
The phone rings
Joey answers it
" " Yeah
We hear Zammito's muffled cries for help
It almost sounds like someone moaning during a sexual act
Joey is surprised at first, then glances over at his wife to make sure she is asleep
He slides his hand under the covers and closes his eyes
" " (quietly) Hmmm
Oh yeah
Uh huh '  -- Zammito stops as he begins to realize what Joey is doing on the other end of the line
He grimaces, then shouts louder
-- Joey is really going to town now as his hand moves slowly under the covers
We hear a loud scream on the phone
" " That's right baby, give it to papa Joey
He is really deep into his fantasy world when
" " Joey, who is that
Joey sits up quickly
" " (loudly; for his wife's sake) -- And don't call here again, you pervert
He slams the phone down
long beat
It rings again
This time he checks his caller  and sees that call is coming from Zammito's house
" " Yeah boss
Again we hear the same muffled cries
" " Boss
-- Raphael enters with Hector and two -
The room is filled with low rider cars
41
Working under the hood of a car is , 30's, sleazy
Raphael walks over and slams the hood down, pinning Felix's upper body and squishing his face between the hood and engine
Someone stole my car tonight
'mon Raphael, you don't think that would steal your car
You run a chop shop for low riders
Yes,  think you'd steal my car
Raphael lifts up the hood and slams it down on Felix again
swear  didn't
wouldn't
And  should just believe-- (overlapping; to Felix) -- you stole my cousin Enrique's car
(to Hector) Hector, don't interrupt me
He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car
don't give a shit about your cousin's car
We're here about my car
So, shut your mouth
You think you can do that
You think you can keep your big mouth shut
Hector is embarrassed as Raphael once again berates him in front of the others
Raphael picks up a pair of pliers of the workbench
He clamps them down on the tip of Felix's nose and squeezes
Felix's face fills with pain
If  find out you're lying
If  find out you know anything about this 'm going to come back and cut off your nose
He gives the pliers one last squeeze, then releases Felix
(to the others) Vamos
42
-- Agent Hadley sips a cup of warm coffee
He looks very concerned
Sir, do you think we could have a hostage situation in there
Agent Hadley is about to answer when he sees something
-- of a Lincoln Town Car pull up
Joey "Two Tons" gets out, goes to the front door and enters
Hold on a second
Joey "Two Tons" just pulled up
'  -- Joey enters to find Zammito tied to the chair, face down on the bed
" " Jesus, Boss
'   -- Zammito stands behind the bar pouring himself a large scotch
They were all French guys
" " French guys
You mean like from France
(with strained patience) Yeah, French guys from France
" " What'd they take
Everything
" " Everything
Everything
" " Boy, you must be pissed
Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me
it does irritate me
43
" " Well,  must say you're handling it very well
You know why 'm handling it very well
Because you're going to get these guys for me
" " Okay boss
Where are they
If  knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you
" " You didn't say find them
You said, "get them
" Just find them
" " Okay boss
Zammito stares at Joey for a long beat, then
Papa Joey
Joey looks away, embarrassed
'  -- Sami can't sleep
He walks over to the table and sorts through the canvas bag containing the contents of Zammito's safe
Inside a small cardboard box he finds several cassette tapes
He removes the box and walks to the stereo system on the floor, then inserts a tape into the cassette deck
moment later Sophie enters
Can't sleep
No
'm sorry things went so wrong today
It's not your fault
She notices the box of tapes
What are you doing
44
thought 'd listen to some of the tapes
See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe
Sounds boring
It's three in the morning
Not much else to do
She grins seductively, then leans in towards him
can think of something
They kiss
'  -- Sami is asleep on the floor, curled up under several blankets
He wakes up and looks to his side expecting to find Sophie
She is not there
Sami looks around for her
Wayne is sitting on the couch preparing his morning joint
She's not here, man
Where is she
think she went to do some laundry
Threw some stuff in a bag and left
It takes a moment for Sami to connect the thoughts
Bag
Sami runs to the table
The black canvas bag is gone
:    Asleep
Sami shakes him
He opens his eyes
Get up
We've been ripped off
'  -- Daniel and Sami are with the crew
They are not a happy bunch
Wayne is smoking his joint, his eyes locked on the television
Oh, man
this is bullshit
You can't trust anyone these days
45
She took everything
Didn't even leave us cab fare
thought occurs to Sami
Not everything
He removes the tape he put in the cassette deck last night before Sophie entered
was going to listen to it last night but  -- He realizes it may not be the time to tell them what happened
-- feel asleep
Wayne blurts out a sloppy laugh
No you didn't, dude
You were bangin' Sophie
saw you guys going at it
You slept with her
Well, actually  would say she slept with me
Daniel stares at him angrily
What's the big deal
It's not like was on guard duty or something
You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you
No
Chicks dig me
Daniel grabs the cassette and puts it in the player
On the tape we hear a phone ringing
' Hello
' It's me
need an answer from you if 'm going to move
46
' We're not just talkin' about a 'piece of work' here
We're talking about a boss
Sami is the first to realize what he is hearing
Holy shit
What
Sami holds his hand signaling them to be quiet so he can hear the rest
' Bonanno's a dinosaur
Guy thinks he's fuckin' Vito Corleone or something
The old ways are gone
If we don't change now we're going to get pushed out need to know if  can count on your support
pause on the line
' Yeah
The line goes dead
Sami leans back
No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff
He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family
This wasn't the deal
The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war
The deal is whatever Mr
Bastaldi says it is
You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you
knew this was a mistake
knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this
could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it
Don't you do it
" Jesus, why don't ever listen to myself
47
Yeah, but you did do it
So let's deal with that
What are you guys so scared of
Zammito doesn't know who we are
We just get out of town and it's over
Oh, you think it's that easy
Yeah
We just go home
We can't
agree with Marcel
say we go to the airport and get on a plane
They'll be waiting for us at the airport
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time
But these tapes
He's never going to stop looking for us
We have to find Sophie
How are we going to do that
know where she went
They all look over at him as he takes a huge hit off his joint
heard her talking on the phone
Bay View Motel
It's about five blocks from here
-- beat up Ford Pinto sputters down the street, black smoke spewing from the tail pipe
--  -- Raphael is at the wheel, his eyes scanning the street for his car
In the passenger seat Hector sits calmly
They come to a red light and stop
'  -- Across the street is low rider car
48
Raphael stares at it as he thinks about his own car
We see the Impala pull up beside them
Raymond is driving
Daniel, Sami and Zero are with him
Hector glances over and sees the Impala
Raymond smiles at him and nods
Hector slowly nods back
He looks over at Raphael who is still looking out the window
The light turns green
The Impala turns right
Raphael looks over at a confused Hector
Tell me the truth Hector
do you think we'll find my car
Hard to say
-- motel like any other
Sami stands outside the office with Daniel, Raymond and Zero
How do we know what room she's in
Wait here
--    -- Sami enters
Behind the counter is the  , middle-aged, balding
Hi
Did a woman just check in
She's about five six
Pretty
Dark hair
can't give out information on our guests
'mon man,  think she's having an affair
So are half the people in this place can't help you, pal
Sami nods and walks outside
Through the window we see him talking with the others
beat
Sami steps back inside with Zero
Look,  can't tell you -- Before he can finish the sentence Zero has his gun out and wedged under the clerks jaw
49
Room fourteen
Thank you
-- Sami knocks
The others stand off to the side of the door
Sophie opens the door and sees Sami
Before she can slam it he pushes it open
-- Sami pushes her onto the bed
really thought we had something special going
can't tell you what a disappointment you've turned out to be
After last night  could say the same for you
Sami feigns a smile
Zero checks the bathroom to make sure she is alone
He looks at Daniel and shake his head
Raymond finds the black canvas bag on the dresser and checks the contents
The money isn't here
Where is it, Sophie
don't know
If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again
She stares at them defiantly
Who are you waiting for
Stick around and find out
--  -- knock on the door
Sami clamps his hand over Sophie's mouth just in case she gets any stupid ideas
Daniel opens the door
Agent Hadley steps in, stares at Daniel, then feels the barrel of Zero's gun pressed against his head
50
Hadley steps into the room
Daniel closes the door
Zero searches him
Finds a gun which he gives to Daniel, then a wallet
He opens it and sees his  identification
He's
Zero knowingly bends down and removes Hadley's backup gun which is strapped to his ankle
He gives the gun to Sami
What is she doing with an agent du
Sami looks at her -- at Hadley -- at the black canvas bag
Slowly it starts to come together in his mind
We've been set up
He stares at Sophie angrily
We didn't go to the wrong house
We went to right one, didn't we Sophie
Her expression gives away nothing
They send us to Zammito's house
The is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move crime is going down and they don't move
Why
(beat) Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us
What does arresting us get them
(to Hadley) You wanna tell him
You're telling it fine
Daniel motions to Zero
You see my friend over there
nod to him and he's going to put a bullet in your knee
Zero stares at Hadley, just waiting for Daniel to give him the go ahead
You wouldn't
51
Daniel nods
Zero aims his gun at Hadley's knee cap
That's going to make a lot of noise
Not much time for a conversation after you pull the trigger
They know he's right
He's got a point
Sami lifts up a heavy brass lamp from the nightstand
He pulls the electrical cord out of the base, then touches two wires together
They spark
Before Hadley can say a word Sami touches them to his hand
Hadley's body jerks violent as he screams
Sami removes the wires
Hadley winces in pain from the burn mark on his hand
Okay
Okay
We've been investigating Zammito for years, but we've never had enough evidence for a warrant to search his house
We got word through a snitch that Zammito was planning on taking Bonanno out
We know all this
You just don't take out a boss
You need permission from the other families to do something like that
Our informant told us that Zammito was talking with other bosses and recording their conversations in case they later claimed they weren't involved
Look at these tapes
The guy has recorded every conversation he's had for years
So we rob Zammito
You arrest us when we come out and the contents of the safe is now evidence which you can use against him
Agent Hadley nods
(to Sophie) What are you getting out of this
There is no point in hiding anything now
Money
It was supposed to simple
In and out
(More) 52
(Cont'd) Zammito wasn't supposed to be there
: --   () We see Zammito walk over to Mario
Mario,  gotta go
When my date arrives will you explain to her  had an emergency
Of course, Mr
Zammito
Zammito leaves
Through the window we see Joey "Two Tons" open the door to the car
Zammito and Joey get in and drive away beat
Taxi pulls up
The front door opens and Sophie enters, all dressed up and beautiful
She walks up to Mario
Hi
'm meeting Frankie Zammito -- : -- Sami stares at her with contempt
Why
Vincent Bastaldi is in jail
For what
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito
What kind of business
Black market art
Zammito got to a few key security guards at the Metropolitan Museum
The Bastaldi's supplied the artists to make copies of famous works
They'd switch the paintings, send the originals to Paris and the Bastaldi's would sell them to private collectors
53
We're talking Matisse, Renoir, Monet
We know for sure they replaced Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve sunflowers" last week with a copy
It was on loan from the London National Gallery and they're not going to be very happy when they find out about it
So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother
Yeah
He delivers the goods on Zammito
If we got what we wanted we'd let his brother go providing he tells us where the Van Gogh and the other paintings are
No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison
We're leaving
Raymond get the bag
You walk out with that bag and you won't only have Zammito and his people after you
You'll have the entire United States justice department
How far do you think you'll get
know who you are Mr
Foray
Mr
Zerhouni
Mr
Gayet
(looks at Zero) Mr
Agent Hadley looks to Sophie
Zero
That's all  know
You'll never get out of the city
They move to the door
-- Daniel, Sami, Raymond and Zero walk to the Impala
Bastaldi's dead
He is fuckin' dead
You want Zero to kill him
54
'm going to kill him myself
What about the money
It has to be at Sophie's
She didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here
We don't know that for sure
Forget the money
We've got bigger problems than the money right now
She probably hid it at her place
The six of us could find it in -- (overlapping) -- We don't have time to look for it
Hadley's first move is going to be to look for us there
Daniel dials a number on his cell phone
We're moving
Pack up and be on the street in five minutes
-- Agent Hadley steps out of the bathroom, a towel wrapped around the burn on his hand
This is turning to shit
If word gets out of my involvement in this 'll go to prison
Listen, we know their names
They don't know the city
You'll find them
You're the
can't bring the Bureau into this
If do the tapes become evidence
They're supposed to be evidence
That's why Bastaldi set this up
55
Fuck Bastaldi and his brother
These tapes are gold
Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back
thought you wanted Zammito
What for
The minute  get him some other Gavone will take his place
've been doing this for twenty years
When retire it's not going to be to some trailer park in the suburbs
She likes the idea
Already she's thinking how she can work her way into this
Too many people know about my involvement in this
Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything
His jaw tightens
You're right about that
Hadley is standing behind her
He lifts up the brass lamp with his towel and swings down hard towards Sophie's head
, '  -- Marcel, Julien and Wayne are waiting as the Impala drives up
Raymond hops out of the car
would like to thank you for your hospitality
(hands him a card) If you are ever in Paris here is my number
Cool
Marcel grabs Raymond and leads him back to the car
Daniel sees Lamar standing across the street
(to the others) 'll be right back
He gets out of the car and walks over to him
56
What do you want now
Guns
Can you get them
Man,  can get anything
Don't bullshit me
ain't bullshittin'
can get guns
can get any kind of gun you want
But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass
You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you
How is that possible
've got a way with people
can see that
The man's car you stole
Raphael Ruiz
He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker
And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes
You're French ain't ya
'm from Belgium
Yeah, 'd be from Belgium too if  was you
You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital
Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt
mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you
Why haven't you turned us in
ain't no rat
(beat) You got money, right
Daniel nods
And, uh, 'm going to have to charge you a commission
kind of like a brokerage fee
57
How much
thousand dollars
Fine
Daniel hands him his cell phone
Take this
'll call you in a few hours
You tell me where we meet
'  -- Wayne is on the couch watching
There is a loud knock on the door
He opens the door to find Agent Hadley
Yeah
Hadley pushes past Wayne and enters
Hey dude, what do you think you're doing
Hadley flashes his badge
Uh
excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something
Not today
Where are your friends
They left about a half hour ago
Where did they go
dunno
Hadley punches Wayne in the face
Wayne falls to the floor
Hey man, you can't do that
What
This
Agent Hadley kicks Wayne in the chest
Or this
Agent Hadley kicks Wayne in the ribs
58
Jesus
What kind of  agent are you
'm your worst fuckin' nightmare
Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that  believe you and right now  don't
So tell me, where did they go
swear man,  don't know
They packed up and left a half hour ago
(points to coffee table) All  got is one of their phone numbers in Paris
Hadley sees the phone number Raymond gave Wayne on the coffee table
He puts it in his pocket and stares at Wayne, then just for the hell of it gives him one last kick in the ribs
-- stops her cart in front of room fourteen
She
Maid service
No answer
She uses her key and steps into the room
beat
We hear a loud scream
-- large building near the freeway
-- Raymond is on the phone
(in French) know Mama, but  couldn't call you yesterday we were very busy
(listens) No, nothing's more important than you
(listens) don't know
think 'm going to have to stay a few more days
Daniel, Sami and Julien sit at a table
Marcel stares out the window sadly
Zero is flipping through the television channels
(to Marcel) Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with Zammito
59
No
You're sure
think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh's "Sunflowers in a vase" would remember it
(correcting him) "Vase with twelve Sunflowers
" Whatever
He never told me about the Van Gogh or any of the other paintings
Raymond hangs up the phone and joins the others
It makes sense
mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up
think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to
Fuck you
You know 'd never go along with something like this
Do
This ain't about that and you know it
This is about you never forgiving me for leaving the crew
(surprised) You guys used to work together
Yeah and he can't stand it that  tried to do something to better myself
(in French) You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better
(in French) Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night
60
All right, knock it off
(in French) All you are is a professional ass-kisser
(in French) 'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine
(in French) What is that a threat
Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel
They take a step towards each other
Sami steps in between them
said knock it off
Now as far as 'm concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over, but right now we've got to figure out what's going on
It's simple
Bastaldi's moving up
He's closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of us
Well,  say the whole deal is off
In fact, if you ask me, there never was a deal because we were screwed from the start
Zero turns to another channel
news broadcast
We see a mug shot photo of  on the screen
Hey Sami, you're on
Zero turns up the volume
Sami Zerhouni in connection with the murder of Sophie Nichols
Sami is stunned
What
Police have confirmed that Zerhouni was seen entering the woman's room by the Motel Manager
61
The Reporter continues her story
Zerhouni is also wanted by police for questioning regarding a robbery last night at the home of alleged Mafia member Frankie Zammito
Pull back
We are now in
'  -- Zammito grimaces as the news of the robbery becomes public
Oh, shit
The Reporter continues
The other members of his gang are reported to be French nationals Daniel Foray, Marcel Burot, Julien Labesse
Pull back again
'  -- Lamar is sitting on the couch watching the news report with amusement
Dumb crackers -- The reporter finishes her story
Raymond Gayet and an unidentified man only known as Zero
Pull back again
'  -- Hadley grins as he watches the report
That should shake things up
62
Up next
vacation get away on a budget -- We are back in
-- Sami turns off the television and looks to the others
Hadley -- Has to be
(freaking out) This is bad
This is really fuckin' bad
Am  the only one who sees how bad this is
Hey, it's not your picture on the , it's mine
So, try to be cool
Don't tell me to be cool
We were supposed to be in and out
In and out
In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia
the
the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us
haven't left out anyone, have
(pretends to think about it) don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city
We've got to get out of here
That's brilliant
Care to elaborate
Sami gets into Julien's face
You're not helping
Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress
You're projecting your anger onto us
Oh, Jesus
We're dead
63
Julien walks away
Daniel picks up the phone and dials a number
'  -- The cell phone Daniel gave him rings
He answers it
Yeah
(
) It's me
Hey you guys are becoming famous
was just watching the news and-- (
) (overlapping) -- Did you set it up
Yeah
All set
Tomorrow morning
Ten o'clock
Room 211
Barclay Hotel on River Street
Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, 'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred
(
) We had a deal
We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime
(
) Fine
Ten o'clock
The line goes dead
Lamar grins, happy with the money he's going to make
-- The others are looking at Daniel
Sami, tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us
What for
We need to rent a car and for that you need a credit card
Why not just steal another one
64
Too risky
We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car
Maybe 'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town
Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago
It doesn't matter where we go
Between Zammito and the  they'll find us
We have to end this here
And how do we do that
don't know
That's an excellent plan
Very comforting
We'll think of something
-- Lincoln Town Car drives up
Zammito gets out with Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake
They wait outside
Zammito enters
' ,  -- Bonanno is behind his desk
Half Tooth Tony sits on the couch
Zammito enters
Bonanno walks around his desk and hugs Zammito
Why didn't you tell me about this
You have enough to worry about, Angelo
You don't need my problems
Bonanno places his hands on Zammito's cheeks and presses them together
We're family
An insult to you is an insult to me
Bonanno releases him
They knew who you were when they broke in your house
Yes
65
What is happening with the world
There was a time no civilian would touch a made man
Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something
What did they take
Some cash
Jewelry
The other stuff can replace, but there's a cardboard box
photos of my mother
They're the only ones  have of her
We're doing everything we can to find these people
Right Tony
We've reached out to everyone we know
If they're still stupid enough to be in this city, Tony will find them
-- Zammito steps out onto the street
Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" are pitching pennies against the wall
They start arguing about something
" " Frankie, come here a second
Zammito walks over
" " Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me
(impatiently) Get in the car
" " Just tell me who's closer to the wall
Zammito grabs him by the neck and smashes his face into the wall
You are
Now get in the fuckin' car
Both men walk to the car
Zammito starts after them, then stops
He turns back, picks up the coins and puts them in his pocket
--  -- Sami moves through a crowd of
He looks around until he sees a man who looks remarkably similar to Raymond
Sami bumps into him and lifts his wallet
66
-- Marcel waits as a  brings over several boxes of electronic equipment
-- Sami passes the shop
He stops
In the window is that is identical to the one that they used on the job
He goes into the store
-- An old building that has seen better days
Daniel and Zero get out of a Taxi and go inside
--   -- Looks even worse on the inside
dark corridor is lit by bare light bulbs hanging from the ceiling
An old  walks past them, her smile signaling she is open for business
They arrive at room 211 and knock
The door is opened by a very large Behind him we can see Lamar with , 20's, sun glasses, his neck draped in gold chains
(very loud) 'm gonna have to search you
We'll save you the trouble
Daniel pulls back his jacket to reveal the gun he took from Hadley in his waistband
(loudly) You can't come in here with that
Daniel looks past him to Ellwood
What's wrong with this guy
He's my cousin
He's deaf
Daniel removes an envelope full of cash
We're here to buy, not steal
If you guys are straight there's not going to be a problem
Ellwood stomps his foot several times on the floor
The black guy feels the vibration and turns around
Let them in
67
The black guy steps aside
Daniel and Zero enter
-- Ellwood is sitting on the bed behind several open suitcases displaying a variety of weapons
What can  do you for
Daniel looks over the merchandise
How much for the nines
grand a piece
'll need extra clips and ammo
Daniel starts counting out the money
Ellwood points a
357 magnum he's been holding behind the open suitcase at them
What the hell you doing, Ellwood gave them my word
Zammito's offering twenty grand a head for these guys
You think 'm going to settle for four 's when  can make forty
(to Daniel) All right
Reach in easy and put the gun on the floor
Daniel slowly grabs his gun and places it on the floor, then kicks it under the bed
said put it on the floor, not kick it under the bed
Ellwood speaks to his cousin, speaking slowly and enunciating each word so he can read his lips
Get that and add it to my inventory
The black guy get on his hands and knees and starts looking for the gun under the bed
As he does Daniel glances over at Zero with a look
Ellwood aims his gun at Zero
assume you're carrying too
Zero opens his coat and reveals his
9mm
68
Okay, put it on the floor
and do not kick it under the fuckin' bed
(flatly) No
He stares at Ellwood calmly through dead, flat eyes
No
Did you just say no
Listen cowboy, if you're thinking about makin' a move, don't
Nobody is that fast
Zero is
Who's Zero
He is
Ellwood is confused
Daniel bolts to his left
Ellwood's eyes leave Lamar for a moment -- it's a moment too long
In a blur of movement Zero has his gun out and fires one shot into Ellwood's forehead
Ellwood slumps down on the bed, dead
The black guy who has heard nothing continues searching under the bed
Zero casually picks up the suitcase filled with guns and hands it to Daniel
They walk out of the room
Lamar stands there, stunned, then quickly runs after them
beat
The black guy pops up with Daniel's gun oblivious to what has transpired in the room
Found it
-- Daniel pushes Lamar out the door
Zero steps out behind him
He stares at Lamar for a long moment, then hands him the envelope
There's ten grand in here
It's yours
'm going to call you again
There's one more thing  need you to do
What
'll tell you when it's time
In the background we hear the loud, agonizing scream from the black guy as he finds Ellwood's body
69
-- Raymond and Julien approach the counter
Raymond is nervous
(in French) am not comfortable with this
'm not a good liar
(in French) Relax
It will be fine
They arrive at the counter
The  , a man in his 30's looks up at them with a smile
Hello
Hello
am Robert
Carney from Dayton, Ohio and  would like to rent a car with my visa gold card
Raymond smiles, a big, friendly, completely over exaggerated smile
Julien looks at him and rolls his eyes
The Rental Agent walks down to the end of the counter and dials a number on the phone
(into phone) got a couple French guys here trying to rent a car
(listens) Sure
can stall them
-- Vinny is in bed, his arm in a cast and sling
His wife , 30's, big hair, loud clothes
She sits on the bed feeding him
His two kids, , 8, and  10, sit off to the side
Zammito enters
Angie, how you doin'
She kisses him
Vinny stares blankly at his brother
Zammito takes a step back, looks her up and down
He lays on the charm
Hey, you're looking good
There's something different about you
You get a boob job or something
've gained weight
Yeah, well, it suits you
70
Zammito moves over to the kids and offers a quick hello
Hey Tommy
'm Richie
He's Tommy
Whatever
Zammito pulls out a roll of bills that could choke a horse and peels one off
Angie, take the kids down to the gift shop and buy 'em something
need a word with Vinny
Angie looks at the money
(flatly) Gee, five bucks
What ever shall we buy
She takes the kids and leaves
She seems pleasant enough
She doesn't know
She thinks  fell down the stairs
That's good
That's what a stand-up guy does
Zammito sits on the edge of the bed
So,  just come by to see how you're doin'
You broke my arm
How the hell do you think 'm doin'
Yeah
mean besides that
They treating you all right
Food okay
Yeah
'm going home today
What do you want, Frankie
don't want anything
(More) 71
(Cont'd) just wanted to say
that  may have
overreacted a little the other day
little
Yeah
mean, you are my brother and
well  should have found another way of expressing my disappointment
So, 've decided to make it up to you
You gonna forget about the money  owe you
What are you nuts
debt is a debt was thinking 'd throw a little extra work your way
You know, you come down to the club, make espresso for the boys
wash their cars
run some errands
things like that
Zammito's cell phone rings
(into phone) Yeah
(his face hardens) 'm on my way
Zammito hangs up
got something  gotta do
'm glad we had this talk
Heal
Get better
Let me know when you're ready to start
Zammito leaves
Vinny can only shake his head in bewilderment
-- Several low-rider cars are parked on the street
Raphael and Hector are with several
ain't seen it your car
Sorry man
Hey, you know who you should talk to is Freddy
thought he was in prison
Got out last month
He's trying to go straight but he's still wired in
(More) 72
(Cont'd) He's working at some restaurant
'll find out where and call you
-- Sami is recording something on a tape deck Marcel bough
He sees Marcel outside on the balcony and removes a piece of paper from his pocket, then picks up the phone and dials
(
) Agent Hadley
Do you know who this is
(
) Yeah
figured 'd be hearing from you
If you ever want to get those tapes, meet me in one hour at Grant Park near the statue
-- The Rental Agent walks back over to Raymond and Julien
'm sorry about the wait
There was a problem with the equipment
Everything okay now
The Rental Agent's eyes drift to a black Lincoln Town Car parked across the street
Everything's fine
,      -- Lincoln pulls up
Zammito gets out and walks over to three in another Town Car
One of the Wiseguys points to the window of the rental agency
Zammito looks at Raymond and Julien
don't know the little one, but the other guy is definitely one of them
Follow them and call me when you find out where they go
Zammito walks back to his car and drives off
73
-- An  drives up in a
He gets out and Julien grabs the keys from him
(in French) 'll drive
(in French) 'm the driver
(in French) 've never driven a Cadillac before
Raymond nods and gets in the passenger seat
-- The Cadillac moves down the street
The Lincoln follows a few cars behind them
--  -- Julien drives the car
(in French) This is a car
think this is the best American car 've ever driven
(in French) This is the only American car you've ever driven
-- Agent Hadley walks towards the statue wearing a pair of sun glasses
As he approaches, Sami steps out
You set me up, you piece of shit
Hadley pushes him up against the statue and starts frisking him
What are you doing
You think 'm going to talk to you until know if you're wired
Wired
ain't wired
74
Sami lifts up his shirt showing Hadley his bare chest
He drops his pants down to his ankles
Okay
Okay
believe you
You killed her
No
You killed her
Manager remembers you going into her room
Your fingerprints were found all over the place
Bullshit
She was alive when we left her with you
You're fucked, Sami
You know it
That's why you're here
Look,  just want out of this nightmare
don't know these guys
few days ago 'm in Paris picking pockets and now 'm America's most wanted
Where are the tapes
can get them -- but what do  get if do
pass
pass
How you gonna give me a pass
witness can put me at the crime scene
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake
Without the murder weapon the won't have enough to prosecute you
They don't have a murder weapon
No
have it
The lamp
The one with your fingerprints and her blood on it
(holds up his burned hand) Remember
75
Sami is stunned, then his thoughts snap back to
: --  () Sami picking up the brass lamp off the nightstand and leaving his fingerprints all over it
: -- Sami stares angrily at Hadley who appears to be enjoying his frustration
Of course they could always get an anonymous tip
Find it in the dumpster behind the motel
Sami stares at him a long moment
You want the tapes for yourself
You're going to sell them
'm going to retire with a shit-load of money
Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life
You didn't have to kill Sophie
Yes  did
Lose ends are messy
What about me
Aren't  a loose end
When this is over you can say whatever the hell you want
'll be long gone
Besides, who's going to believe you
You're just a two-bit crook
And you're a dirty cop
At least  don't pretend to be something different than what  am
Hadley hands him a card
76
When you've got the tapes call me on this number
We'll make the exchange and that'll be the end of it
Hadley leaves
-- Julien drives the Cadillac along the North River
The Lincoln keeps pace with them several cars behind
--  -- Raymond clicks through a few Radio Stations
Julien glances in his rear view mirror
-   :   of the Lincoln several cars back
Julien seems concerned
He turns the steering wheel hard to the right
-- The Cadillac cuts across the right lane almost hitting a car and turns onto another street
The Lincoln makes a sharp move to stay up with it
-- Raymond looks over at Julien
(in French) We're being followed
Julien hits the gas
-- The Cadillac speeds down the street, weaving in and out of traffic
The Lincoln does the same
The Cadillac reaches an intersection
The traffic ahead of them is stopped for a red light
The Cadillac veers onto the sidewalk
Pedestrians jump out of the way and the car streaks down the pavement
Behind the Lincoln follows
-- The Cadillac screeches around the corner, onto a
--  -- Julien concentrates as he weaves the car in and out of the on coming traffic
77
(in French) knew  should have driven
(in French) Stop talking
'm trying to concentrate
-- The oncoming traffic veers off
Cars collide
The Lincoln clips a car, loses control for a moment, then continues after them
At the corner the Cadillac turns onto another street and joins traffic in the right direction
-- The Lincoln moves up along side the Cadillac
Two  lean out the window with guns in their hands
The Cadillac veers away just as they start shooting
Bullets riddle the car
--  -- Raymond removes Hadley's backup gun
The Lincoln pulls up beside them again
The sound of   fills the air as Raymond shoots from the Cadillac
The rear passenger window of the Lincoln shatters and Raymond fires
The Lincoln drops back
-- The Cadillac turns the corner
The Lincoln follows
The traffic is heavier here
The cars have to slow down
The Lincoln moves beside them again
Raymond fires his last shot
His gun his now empty
Several rounds of gun fire come from the Lincoln
--  -- Raymond looks over to Julien
(in French) What are we going to -- His voice trails off as he sees Julien
bullet has glanced his neck, not deep, but deep enough to sever an artery
Blood pours down his neck and covers his shirt
His face is pale
He glances at the wound in the rear view mirror
-- Julien steers the caddy onto another street
The towncar follows
--  -- Julien looks at Raymond
He is paler now, his shirt completely covered with blood
He strains to stay conscious
78
(in French) When we get to the next corner jump out
(in French) 'm not going to leave you
(in French) We both know 'm already dead
Raymond knows he's right
The car races into the next turn
(in French) Go
Raymond opens the door
He jumps out
- '  -- Of Raymond as he rolls towards the curb
The Caddy skids around the corner
-- The Lincoln slams on it's brakes in the middle of an intersection
Raymond is dazed from his fall
He gets up slowly, his pants torn and sees
-- The driver is reaching out the window with his gun to take aim and is just about to shoot when
-- Julien comes racing into the intersection full speed and smashes into the Lincoln
The impact sends the Lincoln spinning around
When it stops the driver's window is facing the front of the caddy
The driver of the caddy takes aim and fires
The bullet goes through the windshield and kills Julien
The driver looks over at the passenger just in time to see
-- Speeds through the intersection and smashes head on into the Lincoln
It crumbles like a toy under the weight
79
-- Raymond limps into the street oblivious to the oncoming traffic
He stares sadly at Julien
-- Zero and Marcel are checking over the guns
Daniel writes some notes on a pad of paper
Sami appears nervous as he sits off to the side
The door opens
Raymond limps into the room
His face is dirty, bruised, his pants torn, legs scraped
He stands there, staring at them through empty eyes
Daniel looks at the door expectantly
He knows the answer before he asks the question
Julien
Raymond's face fills with sadness
He shakes his
--  -- There is a cold silence in the room
Daniel stares at the sliding glass door, staring out over the city
It's not your fault, Daniel
No
He looks at them sadly
We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's house
We all agreed to it
You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up
just want to live long enough to get back to Paris
Just long enough to kill Bastaldi
say we make him pay first
After that you can do whatever you want to him
He's right
Do you have any idea what Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve Sunflowers" is worth
80
No
How much
don't know
It's gotta be millions
We still have to get out of here
Maybe if we gave the tapes back -- (strongly) No
Everyone looks to Zero
They killed our friend
It's personal now
Besides, if we do that, then Julien died for nothing
The tapes are the key
He's right
The tapes give us leverage with Bastaldi
'  -- Agent Hadley sits on his couch, deep in thought
He glances at the paper with Raymond's phone number on the coffee table
beat
He gets an idea
He picks up his phone and dials
Hello
Mrs
Gayet
Do you speak English
(listens) You do
Great
(listens) Oh, you taught Raymond English
You did a wonderful job
'm sorry to call so late but 'm supposed to meet Raymond -- (listens) No,  didn't know he was a difficult child
Mrs
Gayet, 'm calling because -- (listens) No,  don't have any children of my own

Room 912
Thank you very much
-- Tow trucks and cleaning crews work around wreckage of the cars
Only a few   are there

looks over and sees Joey "Two Tons" on the sidewalk
Joey motions with his head to an alley
-- The Uniformed Cop enters the alley and joins Joey
" " What'd you guys find
Dead bodies
The ones in the Lincoln are your
associates
" " And the other car
Some French guy
At least that's what his passport said
You know Joey, shouldn't be talking to you about this
" " Are you forgetting who supplements your income
No
It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck
So, this is a homicide
Are you guys involved in this
" " Yeah
'll come down and make a full confession later
Right now, tell me what else you found
Wallet
hotel room card
Some cash
This sparks Joey's interest
" " What hotel
The Holiday Hotel
" " What room number
don't know
didn't look
" " Go look
82
-- The crew sits around a table trying to figure out how they can get out of town
Okay
Airports, train stations, bus station are out
We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond
Even if we get out of town and go to another airport 'm sure the  and Chicago
has alerted customs
How about Canada
What are we going to do, take a taxi
Sami opens a pack of cigarettes to find it's empty
'm going to get some cigarettes
-- Because of the early hour the room is empty
Raphael and Hector are with  , 30's, hard-looking
He is wearing a bus boy uniform as he sets the tables
can't believe someone would have the balls to rip off your ride
When  find them they won't have them for much longer
'll ask around
If they try to move it can find out
Thanks
Raphael and Hector exit
We move with them through the door into
-- Raphael and Hector head for the front door
The elevator doors opens and Sami exits
They walk past each other as Sami heads across the lobby and into the gift shop
As Raphael and Hector walk out the front door Agent Hadley steps in walks past them
He goes over to a   at the front desk
83
'd like to see the manager please
She walks over to the   and points to Agent Hadley
The Manager walks over
May  help you
Agent Hadley shows him his badge
'm looking for several French men who checked in within the last twenty four hours
They checked in last night
need you to take me to their room
Agent Hadley follows the manager as they walks towards the elevators and pass
Sami who pretends to read a magazine, covering his face so Hadley will not see him
Sami walks quickly across the lobby and passes
Joey "Two Tons", Nicky "The Rake" and three other  enter the hotel
Agent Hadley gets in an elevator with the Hotel Manager
The doors close as the wiseguys approach
The moment the doors close Sami bolts into the lobby and over to the house phones
All of them are being used except one is just about to lift the receiver when Sami pushes him aside
Excuse me
was here first
Sami ignores him as he waits for the hotel operator to answer
The phone just rings and rings
Behind him another elevator has arrived and the wiseguys enter
Sami's frustration is growing as the phone continues to ring
The Man who Sami pushed away is still there
Hey buddy, you just can't push in here
Go away
most certainly will not go-- Sami quickly smacks him on the head with the receiver
The man slinks away
' Operator
84
(into phone) Room 912
-- The phone rings
(to Raymond) Get that, will you
Why do  always have to answer the phone
Because you're the closest
'm not any closer than you are
-- The wiseguys watch the floor indicator
-- The phone continues
Why is everything an argument with you
'm just setting my boundaries
Daniel looks at Raymond and sighs, then gets up and lifts he receiver
Hello
(
) Get out of the room
You've got company coming up
'll meet you at the Chevy
Daniel slams down the phone
The others can see the urgency on his face
Raymond, grab the tapes
We're leaving
Why do  have to pick up the tapes
Jesus
Daniel grabs the canvas bag
85
--  -- The manager is about to open the door with his key
Agent Hadley takes it and removes a gun
You should go now
The manager runs away
Agent Hadley inserts the key and opens the door
His face fills with fear as he sees
'  -- Daniel, Marcel, Raymond and Zero are on the other side, their guns pointed at Hadley's head
-  -- Daniel uses Hadley's handcuffs and handcuffs him to a pipe under the sink
--  -- Daniel, Raymond, Marcel and Zero step into the hall
The moment they do the elevator doors at the end of the hall open
The Wiseguys step out and see them
The door to the room next to theirs opens and a  , 8, dressed in a pink dress steps out
(calling into her room) 'mon, Mommy
Everything seems to move in slow motion
--   The Wiseguys go for their guns
--   The crew goes for theirs
--   The little girl is caught between both groups
--   Marcel lunges forward, tackling the girl to ground
--   The Wiseguys begin to shoot
--   The hallway fills with gunfire
--   Marcel pulls the little girl into her room
--   Plaster explodes off the walls as bullets rip through them
--   The Crew rushes back into their suite
'  -- Marcel hands the frightened girl to her mother, then moves over to the door that joins with the crews
He shoots the lock and moves through the door
-- As Marcel steps through he sees the crew all aiming their guns at him
Daniel gets an idea
As Zero holds off the Wiseguys from the doorway, Daniel goes to the adjoining door on the other side of the suite
He shoots off the lock
86
Let's go
The Crew moves through the door
-- Empty
The crew runs across to the door
Because the room is built at the intersection of two hallways the crew step out into a corridor out of the Wiseguys line of sight
--   -- The Crew exits and heads for the staircase
--   -- Silence
The Wiseguys move down the hall and stop outside the door of the Crew's suite
beat
They rush in
-- Empty
Nicky "The Rake" sees the open adjoining door and motions for them to follow him
--   -- The Wiseguys step out just as the Crew are going through the door to the stairwell
The Wiseguys run after them
Joey "Two Tons" lags behind
-- The Crew runs down the stairs
Above them the Wiseguys follow
Joey "Two Tons" is breathing heavily as he runs down the stairs
-- The door flies open as the Crew runs across the lot
Sami has already started the Impala and is waiting for them
moment later the stairwell door opens and the Wiseguys run out, guns blazing
The Crew heads for the Impala, shooting behind them as they run
Nicky "The Rake"" shoots
Zero is hit in the leg
He falls to the ground, then rolls on his side behind a parked car
He fights through the pain, props himself up and begins to shoot back
Two Wiseguys step out to flank Zero
Zero takes aim and shoots one
He lines up on the other Wiseguy and pulls the trigger again
Click
His gun his empty
87
Daniel and Marcel run towards Zero, firing their guns as fast as they can pull the trigger
Marcel takes aim and fires
The Wiseguy's dive for cover as Marcel blazes away until his gun is empty
We hear tires screeching as the Impala backs up
The Wiseguys shoot, blowing out the back window
They move in on Marcel and Zero
Daniel runs forward with two guns firing at the wiseguys
As he nears Marcel he throws the extra gun to him
:on the gun as it flies through the air
: One of the  has almost circle around the car
: on the gun has it flies through the air
--  : He looks to his left just as the gun arrives
It hits him on the forehead and knocks him down
Daniel fires a few  driving the Wiseguy back
He runs over and with Marcel's help they grab Zero and help him to the car
They dive into the back seat
The car screeches forward and races out of the garage
Silence
The staircase door opens and an exhausted Joey "Two Tons" steps out, gasping for air
--  -- Daniel attends to the wound on Zero's leg
The bullet went clean through
Daniel stares at him
beat
Zero grins, saying thank you
-- distraught Raphael sits across from Hector in a booth near the window
Hector has almost finished eating
Raphael hasn't touched his food
He pushes his plate away
can't eat
Raphael lowers his head sadly
Hector looks out the window
-- of the Impala driving by -- rear window missing, bumper about to fall off
Hector watches it go by, then turns back
Raphael looks up
So, can  have your fries

-- group of small bungalows built adjacent to the interstate
-- Small
Filled with cheap furniture
small kitchenette is off to the side of the room
Zero lays on the bed
Daniel uses his belt as tourniquet to slow the bleeding
Raymond sits at the table staring at the black canvas bag containing the cash and tapes
Marcel is in the kitchenette
(to Zero) When we get back to Paris 'll take you dancing
Zero smiles
Sami enters carrying a shopping bag
He places it on the counter
Bring me the scissors
And the Vodka
Sami removes the items from the bag
He opens the bottle and hands it to Zero who quickly gulps down a few mouthfuls
Cut his pants up the leg to the groin
And be careful when you get near the top
Zero has a very long one
He winks at Sami
What's he joking around for
He's been shot
He's been shot a lot
He's used to it
Raymond cuts the pant leg away
Daniel walks over to Marcel who is standing over the gas range
Over the flame is a tire wrench, the metal tip glowing red hot
Sami opens the bag and removes some white bread
Anybody hungry
What'd you get
Some bread and
89
He removes a can of cheese whiz and sprays the cheese onto the bread
Cheese
All the French guys look at him as though he is from another planet
Cheese
In a can
Sami stuffs his mouth with a big bite
It's good
God,  want to go home
Hey, you know you can't this in France
Thank God
Daniel uses a towel to pick up the tire wrench and walks over to the bed
Sami and Raymond grimace as they think about what's about to happen
(to Zero) Ready
Zero nods
Daniel takes the bottle of Vodka and pours some over the wound
Zero flinches
Daniel looks at Marcel, then releases the belt
Blood flows from the wound
Marcel presses the hot poker against the wound
Zero grunts, but does not scream
His face contorts violently from the pain
-- Zammito sits at a table in the back eating an assortment of pasta
"Innamaraia" plays on the stereo
, 60's, arthritic, finishes making an espresso
He starts carrying it over to Zammito, moving incredibly slow, shuffling one foot in front of the other
Zammito watches him with strained patience
Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" enter
Their faces tell the story
What happened
" " They sort of got away
see
Well, get back out on the street and find them before  "sort of" kill you
90
" " But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss
Oh, 'm sorry
Zammito scoops up a handful of pasta out of his plate and throws it at him
Had enough
Joey "Two Tons" looks down sheepishly, several pieces of pasta are stuck to his face
Zammito walks over to him
Try to get this through that fat, stupid fuckin' head of yours
If Half Tooth Tony finds these guys before we do and Bonanno knows what was in my safe we are all dead
They turn around and leave
Zammito stares after them angrily
Cafones
He looks over at Eddie who is only half way to the table
You gonna bring that over here today, or what
-- Zero is passed out, a half empty Vodka bottle on the nightstand
The others have been up all night
Raymond is across the table from Sami
The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week
You like wine
'm more of a whiskey drinker myself
&
Glenmorangie
Glenmorangie is very good
Sami realizes that Raymond wants to talk about something
anything
that will get his mind of the events that have lead them here
91
But 'll have a glass of Beaujolais with you when we get back
Raymond forces a weak smile
Daniel who has been watching them grabs a few things off the table
'll be back in an hour
Daniel looks at Sami and motions for him to come outside
-- Sami steps outside
Daniel is staring at him
What
Can  trust you, Sami
Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room
If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back
That would have left us with nothing
No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead
You haven't answered my question
Does it really matter what  say
'm leaving you with my friends
'm trusting you to do the right thing today
will
You better
'  -- Daniel walks up to the front door and rings the bell
Half Tooth Tony opens the door and looks him up and down
Yeah
92
would like to see Mr
Bonanno please
Who the hell are you
Tell him 'm the guy who robbed Frankie Zammito
'  -- Half Tooth Tony searches Daniel
He finds a small cassette player, glances at it and sticks it back in Daniel's pocket
(points to a door) In there
'   -- Daniel enters
Half Tooth Tony stands behind him, his eyes locked on Daniel's every move
Bonanno is sitting in an armchair
Either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid
Which one is it
guess we're going to find out
You rob an associate of mine
a friend and-- (overlapping) Not such a good friend
May  reach in my pocket
Bonanno looks to Half Tooth Tony
He's clean
Bonanno nods
Daniel removes the cassette player and turns it on
' Of course
need an answer from you if 'm going to move
' We're not just talkin' about a 'piece of work' here Frankie
We're talking about a boss
' Bonanno's a dinosaur
(More) 93
'  (Cont'd) Guy thinks he's fuckin' Vito Corleone or something
The old ways are gone
If we don't change now we're going to get pushed out
need to know if  can count on your support
Daniel turns off the tape
Bonanno's anger is visible
've got to tell you, Mr
Bonanno, This guy's an idiot
How he's lived this long is a mystery
(seething) don't think it will be a mystery much longer
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years
assume you want something
We've got a lot of people looking for us
We'd just like to go home
You want me to help you get out of the country
Daniel nods
And for my help  would get what
Half the tapes
And the other half
'll destroy them when we get back to Paris
only have your word for that
just want to get my people home know who you are and what you could do to me if  don't honor my word
Where are you staying
94
Daniel grins
He isn't going to tell him
only ask so  can call you when the arrangements are made
How about if  call you
-- Zero and Raymond are sleeping
We hear the shower running in the bathroom
Sami is at the table
The black canvas bag containing the tapes is on the table
Sami removes the identical canvas bag he bought at the store from under the bed and places it on the table
He takes the original and leaves
-- Sami removes the card Hadley gave him, takes out his cell phone and dials
taxi pulls up
Same place
One hour
Sami gets in the taxi and it drives away
beat
moment later another taxi pulls up
Daniel gets out
-- Daniel enters to find Zero and Raymond still sleeping
He looks at the black canvas bag on the table
Marcel steps out of the bathroom wrapped in a towel
-- Hadley is waiting by the statue holding a cardboard box
Sami walks towards him holding the black canvas bag
What the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night
thought we had a deal
Hey, you're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world
took a shot
It didn't work
Did you bring the tapes
Sami holds up the canvas bag
The lamp
Hadley opens the cardboard box to reveal the bloody lamp base
Sami hands him the canvas bag
95
Just a second
You must think 'm a real moron
Hadley removes a small cassette player from his jacket
He picks a tape and inserts it into the player
' just came by to tell that "piece of work" you asked for on Johnny Wicks -- It's done
' Good
How'd he go
' Like the crying rat bastard that he was
Hadley stops the tape
He inserts another one
' Angelo, we can't lean too hard on this guy
He's a congressman
' made Peter Dimiano a congressman
We pay him each month to look after our interests
Hadley grins
This is great stuff
He looks up at Sami
Here you go, sport
Sami grabs the box and leaves
Hadley starts whistling a tune and walks off the other way
As he reaches the tree line Lamar pops out with two of his friends
All of them have guns
'll take the bag
You don't think  see through this
You tell Sami he's dead
One of Lamar's guys searches through Hadley's pockets, finds his gun, then takes his wallet
You're making a big mistake
'm an agent
Hadley stares at Lamar defiantly
Lamar cocks the hammer back on his gun and presses the barrel to Hadley's forehead
Hadley drops the canvas bag
Lamar picks up the canvas bag and runs away
Hadley stands there fuming
Lamar runs towards the statue and disappears behind it
-- 96
Daniel is waiting, holding the other black canvas bag
As Lamar passes they quickly exchange bags
From Hadley's point of view Lamar has merely run behind the statue as he heads for the street
Lamar runs a few more steps, then stumbles and falls
several cassette tapes spill out of it
Lamar's buddies are already at the street
' 'mon, man
Let's get out of here
Lamar gets up, looks at the bag, pretends to be panicked
He runs off leaving the bag laying on the grass
: He can't believe his luck
He runs over, picks up the loose cassettes and puts them back in the bag, then leaves
: he peers out from behind the fountain, watching as Hadley walks off in the other direction
-- Daniel arrives to find Sami and Lamar
See,  told you that you could trust me
Daniel grins and pats him on the back
Okay, we're square now, right
There's just one more thing  need you to do
Lamar is about to protest when Daniel takes out a roll of bills
'm listening
--  -- Daniel and Sami sit in the back
Daniel is on his cell phone
(into phone) Mr
Bonanno,  was wondering if you-- (listens) That would be fine
Thank you
-- Hadley enters with the black canvas bag
The  hands him a package
This came for you
97
'  -- Hadley opens the package and finds a video cassette
Hadley pops the cassette into the
On the screen we see Sami speaking into a video camera
Since we're such good pals  thought 'd sneak you an advanced copy of my latest work
call it, " am a scum-sucking agent"
On the television screen we see Hadley and Sami in the park on their first meeting
You want the tapes for yourself
You're going to sell them
'm going to retire with a shit-load of money
Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life
You didn't have to kill Sophie
Yes  did
Lose ends are messy
The color drains from Hadley's face
Sami reappears, talking into the camera again
It's a little arty  know, but it has great content, don't you think
You were so busy looking for a wire you probably didn't even think about a video camera
It was on the statue
Anyway, 've sent a copy of the whole tape to the Chicago
and the
They'll get it tomorrow
If  were you 'd take the day off
The tape turns to static
Hadley tries to think
He takes the tape from the machine, then picks up his phone and starts to dial a number
beat
He thinks better of it, hangs up and uses his cell phone
-- Eddie is on the phone
Zammito is at his usual table
Hey boss, some guy named Hadley
Says he's got some tapes you want
Zammito springs out of his seat and grabs the phone
98
Yeah
(listens) How much
Are you nuts
(listens) Okay
Okay
There's an old warehouse on Merchant Street
-- Zammito and Joey "Two Tons" rush to the car carrying a briefcase
'  -- Raymond knocks on the door
Vinny answers it, his arm in sling
Mr
Zammito
Uh huh
represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother
don't know what you're talking about
understand
The person who sent me wishes to help you
How
You see that car
Vinny looks on the street and sees the Impala
Yeah
It's yours
gift
gift you could give to your brother
or anyone you owe money to as partial payment
No shit
The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow
99
-- An old building, dirty windows and peeling paint
The main door is open
-- Zammito and Joey "Two Tons" are standing next to Zammito's Lincoln
Hadley parks ten yards away and gets out with the black canvas bag
Those the tapes
Hadley starts to place the canvas bag on the hood of Zammito's car
Watch the paint
Hadley opens the bag
It is filled with cassette tapes
The money
Zammito nods to Joey "Two Tons" who opens another briefcase filled with cash
How'd you get these
got 'em
That's all you need to know
Hadley starts to go
Zammito motions him to stop
Just a second
Zammito picks a tape and tosses it to Joey "Two Tons
" Who puts the cassette into the cars cassette player
Suddenly we hear Wayne Newton singing "Danke Schoen
" ' Danke Schoen, darling Danke Schoen
Thank you for all the joy and pain
Hadley's face turns white
He produces an audible gulp as he looks at Zammito weakly
-- The music continues as we hold on a wide shot of the building
' Pictures show, second balcony, was the place we'd meet
Through the dirty windows we see several flashes as the air fills with gunfire
100
' second seat, go Dutch treat, you were so sweet
Zammito's Lincoln pulls out of the warehouse and drives down the street
--  -- Music continues in the cassette deck
Joey "Two Tons" drives
Zammito sits in the passenger seat
Can you believe that guy
What a moron
" " (referring to cassette) Good song though
Great fuckin' song
-- Sami, Marcel and Raymond help Zero out of the taxi and towards a small plane
Off to the side Bonanno is standing with Half Tooth Tony
Daniel walks over to him
This plane will take you to Canada
From there you can fly back to Paris
Thank you
You have something for me
Daniel hands him the cassette case with half the tapes
Bonanno hands it to Half Tooth Tony who takes them into the car and listens to a tape
They're good, boss
And the other half of the tapes
You have my word
'll destroy them
-- The Lincoln pulls up
Zammito and Joey "Two Tons" get out
Vinny is waiting beside the Impala
What's this

Oh really
Thanks
thought it was a sewing machine
What the hell is it doing here
It's for you
For me
What am  going to do with a piece of shit like this
don't know
Sell it
It's gotta be worth something
Someone gave it to me
'mon Frankie, 'm trying to make good here
Okay
Okay
'll get you the papers tomorrow
Vinny starts to walk away
(yelling after him) Hey, if you're well enough to be walking around you're well enough to start working here
-- gang hang out
Raphael is with several hard-looking gang-bangers
Lamar arrives with two of his friends
You lost
Don't come off like a hard-on with me
'm about to make you a very happy man
-- Several Gang Bangers stand around their low rider cars
Sananta's "Oye Como Va" plays loudly on one of the radios
Raphael talks heatedly with several of the gang bangers
Music continues as several gang members check their guns
102
-- The Santana song continues as several car loads of Gang Bangers drive down the street
-- The air is thick with cigar smoke
Several  hang around the bar
Zammito is at his table with Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake
"   "Return To me" plays on the jukebox
Outside we hear the sound of cars pulling up and screeching to a stop
The door opens and Raphael and ten other very tough-looking step inside
The room falls silent, except for Dino on the jukebox
Zammito stands up
Anybody know about that car outside
Yeah
It's mine
No
It's mine
The hell it is
'm telling you that's my car
And someone's gonna pay for it
And 'm tellin' you it ain't
Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here
Fuck you, grease-ball
Fuck me
Fuck you
They are right on the edge of having a major disaster
The Dean Martin song ends
Dead quiet
Each group watches the other to see who's going to make the first move
The jukebox selects another record
The needle scratches against the vinyl intro
We hear the intro to   singing "Amore Scusami"
--   Raphael's eyes burn into Zammito's --    Gang-Bangers eyes dart from side to side
--    Wiseguy bites his lip
--   Nicky "The Rake" twitches his fingers nervously
--   Sweat glistens on the forehead of Joey "Two Tons"
103
At the bar Eddie reaches behind for something without looking
He knocks over a bottle
It falls to the floor and breaks
The noise is enough to push things over the edge
' My love, forgive me
Raphael goes for his gun
All hell breaks loose
People dive for cover as shots rings out
In the close quarters it's like shooting fish in a barrel
' didn't mean to have it end like this
Eddie lifts a shotgun from behind the bar and blows away a gang member
Another gang member kills him
It's a massacre
Bodies drop like flies
The room is so thick with smoke you can't see two feet in front of you
Finally it is quiet
' didn't mean to have you fall in love, in love with me
We move through the room, past the carnage
Smoke swirls, blood covers the floor
Raphael is dead
Along with Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" On the floor, Zammito is against the bar
He sits up, amazed that he is untouched
He gets to his feet and makes his way to the front door
-- Music continues
Zammito staggers outside and into the street
He laughs, a nervous laugh at his good fortune
' My love, please kiss me
Zammito turns around to see '  --  Lincoln Town car speeding towards him
Through the windshield he can see the smiling face of Half Tooth Tony
The front of the car slams into Zammito, lifting him into the air
He flips head over heals then smashes into the windshield and over the car
He lays in the middle of the street, dead
The Lincoln speeds off down the street
' Arrivederci amore kiss me
'  -- Music continues
Bonanno sits on his couch, eating a cannoli as he watches Judge Judy on television
104
' Remember when we part
-- Music continues
Agent Hadley is leaning against his car, his eyes open, a large bullet hole in his head
' You'll have my heart
'  -- Music continues
Wayne is sitting on the couch, an open package on the coffee table
He smiles as he stares at the stacks of cash the crew took from Zammito
--  -- Music continues
The crew sits quietly
' love you so

Music fades
: ''  --  -- Bastaldi steps outside into the crisp morning air
He takes a few steps, then stops
-- across the street, standing side by side are Daniel, Sami, Raymond, Marcel and Zero
They look like a ragged bunch, tired, dirty
We  across the faces of each one of them as they stare at Bastaldi
goes by blocking Bastaldi's view of the boys
When it passes the crew it gone
Bastaldi bites his lip nervously
Bastaldi looks around, but there is no sign of them
We can see the five of them crouched behind a parked car
Marcel peers through the window at Bastaldi who is still trying to figure out where they went
They are all amused with Bastaldi's bewilderment
What's he doing
105
He's looking around for us
Zero can't stay like this much longer
His leg is hurting
Finally, Bastaldi turns around and goes back into his apartment
'  -- Bastaldi is at his desk, nervously tapping his fingers on the surface
The phone rings
He knows who is calling
He stares at the phone for a long moment, then he slowly lifts the receiver
Hello
(
) (in French) It's Daniel
(in French) Daniel
Listen 'm afraid there has been a big-- (
) (overlapping; in French) -- 've got the tapes
If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what  say
Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock
(in French) million
don't have that kind of money
(
) (in French) Don't bullshit me, Laurant
know about the Van Gogh
(In French) don't have it
That's why Vincent went to Chicago
They arrested him before he could bring it back
(
) (in French) Well, you better get the money somehow
Six o'clock and come alone
If you don't we'll destroy the tapes
The line goes dead
106
-- Bastaldi drives up
He gets out carrying a suitcase and nervously walks to the boat
-- Bastaldi enters
No one appears to be there
Bastaldi's cell phone rings
He answers it
(
) (in French) Go back on deck
There's a small rowboat in the water -- -- Daniel, Sami and Zero watch the houseboat
Daniel continues his conversation on the cell phone
(in French) Put the money in the rowboat and untie it
The current will carry it down river
When we see that the money is there 'll call back and tell you where the tapes are
' : Bastaldi appears on deck
He puts the suitcase in the rowboat and unties it
It drifts slowly into the current
-- The rowboat hugs the shore, moving slowly down the river
Marcel is on the shore with Raymond
Raymond reaches out with a long pole and pulls the boat to shore
Marcel opens the case
Inside are several stacks of five hundred franc notes
Marcel looks to Raymond with a grin and nods
Raymond opens his cell phone
-- Daniel, Sami and Zero continue to watch the houseboat
Sami's cell phone rings
He answers it and listens
(
) We're in business
Sami nods to Daniel
-- Bastaldi's cell phone rings
He answers it
(
) (in French) Go down into the main cabin
The tapes are in the wooden chest
107
The line goes dead
-- Bastaldi enters, looks around the room until he sees the wooden chest
He walks over and opens it
Inside there are several cassette tapes in the cardboard box
Bastaldi grins and lifts the cardboard box out of the chest
He hears a
He notices something is attached to the bottom of the cardboard box
It's a long thin wire that has pulled the pin on an electronic device
-- Daniel is now holding small, black device
yellow light starts flashing
He puts his finger on a red button
This is for Julien
He presses the button
-- digital counter begins counting backwards
Bastaldi realizes that the device is a
He stares at the numbers quickly speed by 8

Oh, Merde
-- The houseboat explodes in a brilliant fireball, sending pieces of wood and metal flying into the air
thick plume of black smoke swirls in the wind
-- Daniel, Raymond, Sami, Raymond, Marcel and Zero watch the smoldering wreckage
Their blank faces show no emotion -- just a sense that justice has been done
Did you have to use that much explosive
promised Bonanno 'd destroy the tapes
Raymond opens the suitcase and looks inside
As he peels through the stacks of money we see that only the top bill of each stack is real -- underneath them all is white paper, cut to the same size as the bills
Everyone turns to Marcel
You didn't check it
108
-- The five of them walk across the bridge
'm sorry
was caught up in the excitement of the moment
should have checked
made a mistake
suppose that none of you have ever made a mistake before
No one answers him
Sami reaches inside the black canvas bag and removes the autographed baseball Marcel took from Zammito
This is great
After everything we've been through we've got eight hundred euros and an autographed baseball
The baseball is mine
No
You can't have the baseball
You're not entitled to the fuckin' baseball
Sami throws the baseball back in the canvas bag
'm the one who took it
It's my baseball
If you say baseball one more time Zero will shoot you
Raymond, don't you think they're over reacting a little
No
think they have a right to express their anger with you in light of the fact that you're

Raymond's anger takes everyone by surprise
Even Raymond is surprised by his outburst
Fine
All of you want to be angry
Be angry
but 'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine
No
109
Give it to me, Sami
No
Marcel tries to take the ball out of the bag
Sami pulls it away
Marcel grabs the bag
Both of them tug on it
Marcel pulls hard and the bag rips down the seam
The baseball falls out and rolls off the bridge into the river
Perfect
Marcel stands there holding the inside liner of the bag
Sami throws the canvas bag to the ground in frustration
Something catches Daniel's attention
'  -- of the black canvas
The lining has been ripped away
light breeze blows lifting the underside of the black canvas
There is a flash of color
Another gust of wind turns the black canvas over
On the other side is Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve sunflowers"
Daniel's jaw drops
The others notice his stunned expression and follow his stare
-- of the priceless painting
They stand there, too shocked to move at first, then rush forward
They have almost reached the painting when a truck passes them
The wind kicks up the painting, blowing it over the railing
They reach out to grab it, but it is too far away
They stand there, watching as it slowly floats down to the river below
--   -- They look at one an other, then without speaking a word they all jump off the bridge
As they fall towards the water we
