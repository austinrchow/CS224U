a screenplay by Charlie Kaufman based on an unauthorized biography by Chuck Barris third draft (revised) May 5, 1998 : ,   : This film is a reenactment of actual events
It is based on Mr
Barris's private journals, public records, and hundreds of hours of taped interviews
: - :   ,  1981 It's raining
cab speeds down a dark, bumpy side-street
- Looking in his rearview mirror, the cab driver checks out his passenger: a sweaty young man in a gold blazer with a "" insignia over his breast pocket
Several paper bags on the back seat hedge him in
The young man is immersed in the scrawled list he clutches in his hand
passing street light momentarily illuminates the list and we glimpse a few of the entries: double-coated waterproof fuse (500 feet); 38 ammo (hollowpoint configuration); potato chips (Lays)
An excerpt from The Gong Show (reenacted)
The video image fills the screen
We watch a fat man recite Hamlet, punctuating his soliloquy with loud belching noises
The audience is booing
Eventually the man gets gonged
Chuck Barris, age 50, hat pulled over his eyes, dances out from the wings to comfort the agitated performer
Why'd they do that
wasn't done
( 50) don't understand
Juice, why'd you gong this nice man
Not to be
That is the answer
The studio audience laughs

- The cab sloshes to a stop in front of a liquor store
The young man gets out, jogs through the rain toward the fluorescent storefront
The cab driver waits, listens to staticky reports in a foreign language on his radio
The meter is running
The back seat is piled high with bags
Chuck Barris spastically dances on the screen along with Gene Gene the Dancing Machine
Barris turns to the camera, points at it
We'll be right back with more stuff
- The back of the cab is filled with even more bags and boxes
The cab stops
The young man gets out and confers with a shady looking guy on the corner
The young man pulls out a big wad of cash
Money and a small package change hands
The meter in the cab is at thirty-five dollars and change
Chuck Barris is being sniffed in the crotch by a large dog
The audience howls with glee
Suddenly the video image explodes
Slow motion sparks and shards of glass shoot toward the camera
We pull back to reveal we're in a darkened, messy hotel room
We pan across the walls, past taped-up, yellowed newspaper clippings with headlines like "Gong Show a New Low in Television", "The Dumbing of America", and "Chuck Barris is the Decline of Western Civilization
" We come to rest on a naked middle-aged man crouching in the shadows in the corner, holding a gun
This is Chuck Barris
The television continues to sputter, spark, and smoke
There is a knock at the door
(mumbly) Fuck
Shit
Piss
Naked Barris, still holding the gun, seems panicked
He hesitates, trying to determine his options
Should he answer the door
Should he climb out onto the window ledge
Finally, he creeps to the door and peeks out the peephole for a long moment
He unlocks the door, opens it
The sweaty, young man, a bellhop, stands there with his many bags
() 3
: He tries to appear casual as takes in the sight: a naked Chuck Barris holding a gun, an exploded, smoking tv set in the background
(') (weakly) More stuff
Yes sir, Mr
Barris
Everything you requested
Except  couldn't find a
(consults list) -10 directional fragmentation mine
Well, it's late
(mumbling and bowing) But thank you
Thank you for trying
You are a scholar and a
Barris trails off, gives a quick glance both ways down the hall, then motions for the bellhop to enter
The bellhop places the bags on a table, fishes in his pocket and pulls out some bills
(') Keep it
It's okay
Keep it
You are a scholar and a
Barris trails off
(eyes averted) Thank you, sir
Suddenly Barris becomes agitated
Why are you not looking at me like that
Do  look ugly to you
(runs to the mirror) It's the not sleeping
'm not sleeping, see
have a lot on my
Barris trails off
There is a pause
The bellhop attempts to make conversation
(re: exploded tv) Um, another Gong Show rerun, sir
The naked Barris approaches the bellhop, drapes his arm over the young man's shoulder and walks with him
() 4
: (2) (conspiratorially) You know what 'd do
-- And don't tell anybody -- 'd rub
'd rub Alpo brand dog food on my dick so the dogs would stick their noses into my
dick
Guaranteed big laugh, right
That was my trick, my great contribution to the world
How wouldn't  degrade myself, ask you
There is a silence
(') (screaming) ask you
don't know, sir
Suddenly Barris punches himself in the head, flops down on the unmade bed
The bellhop glances at Barris's bare ass, looks away
(') Mr
Barris, maybe if you just don't watch the show every night, you wouldn't have to -- always pay for the damn tv's, don't
(turning to face him) Don't
It's -- Yes, you do, sir, and we appreciate that -- It's just that there've been complaints from some of the other guests, and Mr
Andrews, the assistant manager, requested that  -- Still
Complaints
specifically used the silencer this time
Specifically
Well, the people in 917 found a bullet lodged in their wall
And while we want to accommodate you -- we certainly value your patronage -- there is an issue of customer safety
Barris lets this sink in
() 5
: (3) Yes, of course
Barris finds his pants draped over a chair, pulls out his wallet, holds some more money out to the bellhop
(') My apologies
Buy -- 917, is it
-- buy them a magnum of your finest champagne
And
and your finest spackle
Oh, and get me a bag of plastic army men while you're out
forgot to tell you before
The bellhop sighs, takes the money
Thank you for your understanding, sir
The bellhop exists
(calling after) And some black socks
Seven black socks, you rascule
Barris locks the door, dumps the contents of the bags onto the floor, fishes through the mess for a cigar, puts the cigar in his mouth, studies himself in a full length mirror
(') Bellhop Johnson was clearly repulsed by the sight of me
And why not
'm wrinkled
(searches for simile, then proudly) like a prune
Covered in liver spots
(searches for simile) like an old guy
My hair is falling out in clumps, leaving exposed patches of white, sickly scalp
flabby inner-tube of fat hangs from my waist, practically obscuring my bedraggled prick -- dark and shriveled and dead
Still leaking urine even though  left the toilet ages ago
My asshole itches
Hemorrhoids abound
George Orwell said every man has the face he deserves by fifty
Does every man have the asshole he deserves by fifty, as well
Does every fifty year old asshole have the asshole he deserves
6
- This feels real, verite
The actual Chuck Barris, smoking a cigar, is being interviewed
He stands outside his villa in St
Tropez, older than the middle-aged Barris depicted in the hotel room, and talks to someone off-camera
It was 1981
had holed myself up in this New York hotel
Parker Hotel
Terrified of everything
Ashamed of my life
(
) Ashamed
What do you mean
Barris walks through a small vegetable garden as he talks, occasionally adjusting a stake or pulling out a weed
When you're young, your potential is infinite
You might do anything, really
You might be great
You might be Einstein
You might be Goethe
Then you get to an age where what you might be gives way to what you have been
You weren't Einstein
You weren't anything
That's a bad moment
But  remembered something Carlyle wrote: "
there is no life of a man, faithfully recorded, but is a heroic poem of its sort, rhymed or unrhymed
"  realized my salvation might be in recording my wasted life, unflinchingly
Maybe it would serve as a cautionary tale
Maybe it would help me understand why
- Barris, now in a hotel terrycloth bathrobe and a porkpie hat, sits at a desk and types manically
(
) My name is Charles Prescott Barris have written pop songs,  have been a television producer
am responsible for polluting the airwaves with mind- numbing, puerile entertainment
In addition,  have murdered thirty-three human beings
am damned to hell
: 7
- It's sepia
Three year old Chuck, dressed somewhat girlishly and sporting a blonde pageboy haircut is being posed on a pony by a photographer
His mother stands by anxiously as the boy totters on the animal
(
) Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1931, my early childhood remains accessible to me only as a series of elliptical, enigmatic memories
- smiling butcher hands a slice of bologna to young Barris, who puts it in his mouth
(
) The taste of bologna fresh from the butcher

Young Barris dances around it
(

We're close on the velvet material being slipped over his head

(
) constant, inarticulate rage leading to fist fight after fist fight
- Young Barris watches dust motes lit by the early morning sunlight pouring through his bedroom window

: (
) The calm  felt watching dust suspended in the early morning sunlight
- Young Barris sits on the floor and watches the shadow of a man walking upstairs
The young boy is clearly terrified
(
) remember fear
- Toddler Barris watches his mother change clothes
He studies her pendulous breasts
She looks down, smiles warmly
(
) Love
You like the way mommy looks, Chuckie
( 4) Yes
bet you would like to be a mommy some day, wouldn't you
Yes, mommy
Please
'mere, you
His mother lifts the little boy to her breasts and presses his face against them
He is in heaven
- Four year old Chuck sits at the dining room table with several other four year olds
They all wear party hats
Barris's father, a milquetoast middle-aged man enters in birthday hat, carrying a cake decorated with four lit candles
He leads the children in "Happy Birthday Dear Chuck" as young Chuck beams
(
) Rejection
() 9
: Chuck glances at the kitchen doorway
His mother stands there, staring at him
She dressed in black mourning clothes, complete with veil
- Young Chuck peeks in as his mother sits in a rocking chair and holds Barris's infant sister
She fusses with the bows and frills on the baby's outfit
The light in the room is golden and warm
(
) Expulsion
We move in on the little boy's devastated face, then follow him as he turns and walks down the hall into darkness
: - sixteen year old Barris lies on his back on a couch lazily tossing a football in the air
Tuvia, a thirteen year old girl, sits on the floor playing with a puppy
In the background, throughout the scene, we hear the inept playing of scales on a bass violin
(
) When  was sixteen  had an experience with my little sister's friend Tuvia that left an indelible impression
(') Phoebe's no Walter Page, huh, Tuvia
don't know who that is
Of course you don't
(beat) Why are you waiting around anyway, listening to this cacophonous cacophony, when you could be in your own abode disrupting the lives of your own siblings
don't know what anything you say means
No
You wouldn't, would you
() 10
: Barris watches Tuvia playing with the dog
She gets on all fours and yelps, imitating the dog
This excites the dog, who bounces around her
Barris studies Tuvia's exposed white underwear for a while
This excites Barris
Finally he pulls an afghan off the back of the couch and drapes it over his pants
We hear him unzip his fly
(') Hey
(not looking) What
Hey, Tuvia
(turning) Wha-at
Tuvia sees Barris fiddling with something under the afghan
She gets quiet
You wanna lick it
Tuvia snorts, goes back to playing with the dog
No
Why should
Well, for one thing it tastes like strawberry
My sister tells me you love strawberries
Yeah, well
hate strawberries
Honestly, a man's penis tastes exactly like a strawberry lollipop
Look,  know that's not true, so -- It is true
It's weird but it's true just read a research paper on it
Tuvia looks at the afghan
11
- Middle-aged Chuck Barris turns from the typewriter and stares out the window at the dark night sky
(sadly wistful) My first love
- Tuvia's face jerks up into frame
She spits
Uchh
Yech
It doesn't taste anything like strawberry, you creep
The dog sticks his head under the afghan
Barris shoos him away
(curious) Well, what does it taste like
Tuvia gets up
'know, 'm gonna tell your mother what you just did
If you do, 'll tell your mother you made our dog lick your crack
did not
(shrugging) So what
- Middle-aged Barris types as the camera glides over some of the acquired detritus in his room: skin magazines, a gun and silencer, liquor, a copy of Beyond Good and Evil, a disguise kit, a kid's sprouted lima bean science fair project
(
) Perhaps my whole life turned at that point
The repulsiveness of my sex confirmed by the tastebuds of a ripening pubescent girl
12
Sequence of young Barris unsuccessfully attempting to pick up girls at bars, unsuccessfully attempting to cop a feel on a date in a movie theater, standing on a front porch unsuccessfully attempting to kiss a girl good night, standing outside of a movie theater in the rain, holding an umbrella over his head and checking his watch
(
) (') And so  found myself in a downward spiral of debauchery
Endlessly chasing pussy
My only focus in life: to get laid, to get blown, trying to fool myself into believing that given the right combination of circumstances and deception, maybe the Tuvias of the world could desire me the way  desired them
only wanted to be loved
- Barris is fighting another drunken guy
He's getting pummeled
(
) constant, inarticulate rage led to bar fight after bar fight
The two men get tossed from the bar
- The other guy gets up, brushes himself off, orients himself, and after a moment starts beating Barris again
- : New Jersey Turnpike, 1955 bus drives along
We see from the sign above the windshield that it is bound for New York
- Young Barris, age 24, in traveling clothes and red hunting cap, stares out the window
(
) As much as  tried,  couldn't understand my past and my present was miserable, so, at twenty-four,  decided what  needed was a future
13
(1955) - Young Barris, suitcase in hand, looks up at the impressive building
People hurry by
(
) had heard that television was an industry with a future
Barris enters the building with resolve
(1955) - Young Barris, age 24, dressed in an  blazer is leading a group of sheep-like tourists down a hall
Next, we'll have a look at the studio where they produce the Today Show
The tourists "ooooh
" Another tour group comes around a corner
This one is led by Georgia, a perky, blonde southern girl
The two groups squeeze past each other
Chuck tries to make eye contact with Georgia
He smiles at her, but she ignores him
- Barris is at the cash register paying for his food
He looks around for a place to sit
He spots Georgia, sitting with a female friend, and he sits at a table behind, so as to listen unobserved to their conversation
That fella Raymond in payroll is kinda cute, huh
Cute's all well and good, Mary Ann, but what you want is a man who's goin' places
go-getter on the management fast-track
Barris registers this information
- Barris stands at the counter talking to a female clerk
Management trainee application, please
The clerk hands him an application without looking up
() 14
: (') How many people applying for this so far
(calculating) Let's see, including you
about two thousand
For how many positions
(looking up and smiling) Five
- Barris sitting with a book and copying the names of three of the board of directors of  onto his application under the heading of "Personal References
" '  - Young Barris is having sex with Georgia
They finish
Barris rolls off her and onto his back
Georgia sighs
Tell me again
Head of network sales at thirty
Head of the entire network at forty
And
(rote) Dead of a heart attack by fifty with all my millions left to you
You're wonderful
love you, Mr
Chuck Barris, management trainee
She climbs on top of Barris and begins kissing him all over
(
) Life was sweet
For a minute
15
'  - Georgia is looking radiant as she reads a movie magazine
Barris enters
She runs over to kiss him
Baby doll
got fired
She pulls away, studies him for a moment, lets it sink in
Fired
Fired
--
Fired
What the fuck did you get fired for
don't know, efficiency cutback
Some bullshit
Look, it's gonna be
Well, 'm pregnant, you fuck
Pregnant
Yeah, pregnant
What the fuck did you get pregnant for
What do you mean, what the fuck did  get pregnant for
You got me fucking pregnant, you fuck
Well, fuck you
- Barris sits drunkenly at the bar
He talks to a drunken guy next to him
() 16
: So  figured 'd skip town
intend to be important, y'know,  can't be saddled with this
But then  remembered something Carlyle said: "Do the duty which lies nearest thee
" Who's Carlyle
Dear God, why do  even bother
Hey, fuck you, you condescending prick
Hey, fuck you
Hey, fuck you
Hey, fuck you
The guy punches Barris
fight ensues

Georgia enters
(pissy) Looks like  was just late
Barris barely acknowledges this, continues to watch tv
'  - Barris and Georgia are in bed
Georgia is asleep
Barris opens his eyes, quietly climbs out of bed
- Another verite-looking interview
middle-aged blonde woman, the actual Georgia, is talking to someone off-camera
Sitting next to her is a Jewish-looking middle-aged man
woke up and he was gone
No note
No nothing
never saw him again
Until that stupid tv show he did
() 17
: - The Gong Show
know what it's called, jerk
- We're close on a copy of the  Herald Tribune
The headline reads Clark Testifies Before "Payola" Committee
We pull back to see young Barris, in a suit, reading the paper in a passenger car of a moving train
(
) In '61  was thirty
had become a minor suit at
It was during the music payola scandal
- American Bandstand is taping
The studio is filled with dancing teens
Barris sits off to one side behind an imposing desk in the semi-darkness, suspiciously watching Dick Clark's every move, and taking copious notes
Clark glances over nervously
(
) so my job was to commute to Philly every day to the American Bandstand tapings, and keep an eye on Dick Clark
- The actual Dick Clark is being interviewed
Chuck Barris
He spooked me
tried to keep on his good side becuase he was sort of
spooky
(
) How so
dunno, there was something in his eyes
Something dark, like unbridled ambition, maybe
Or an inarticulate rage
- Barris walks through the crowds
dark look in his eyes as he follows some giggling teenage girls in poodle skirts
() 18
: (
) On weekends  used to hang around amusement parks
Because that's where the young girls were
'   - Young Barris lies in bed masturbating
(
) wrote a song about my experience
The song "Palisades Park" begins
Last night  took a walk after dark/to see a place called Palisades Park/to have some fun and see what  could see/that's where the girls are : sign above the stage reads The Dick Clark Saturday Night Beechnut Show
Freddie Cannon is on stage singing "Palisades Park" as a crowd of 1962 teenagers dance on the studio floor
(
) got it to Freddie "Boom Boom" Cannon through my friendship with Dick Clark
Dick really wanted to help me out
took a ride on the shoop de shoop/that girl  sat beside was awful cute/and when we stopped she was holding hands with me/my heart was flying/up like a rocket ship/down like a roller coaster/fast like a loop de loop/round like a merry go 'round
Young Barris watches happily from behind the cameras
He spots, Debbie, a pretty, bland young woman with headphones and a clipboard
He sidles over to her
Hi
What
() 19
: Hi
Oh
wrote this song
Oh
Uh-huh
It's number three on the pop charts
Barris pulls out music magazine clipping as proof
Huh
- Barris and Debbie are having dinner
See,  believe there's a great future in television
Uh-huh
So 'm going to take my royalties and create a pilot
pilot is what they call a test tv show
work in tv
Yeah
It's gonna be a game show believe there's a great future in game shows
That's good
Everyone loves game shows, right

() 20
: Well, they do
That's great then
'm on my way
There is a long, awkward silence
They both saw away at their steaks
'  - Barris and Debbie are having sex, sort of mechanical
They're plowing through, kind of like sawing through their steaks
When it's over, they both just lie there
'   - Young Barris, in his underwear, sits alone in the semi- darkness and stares out the window
The front door unlocks and a woman enters, backlit from the hallway
She turns on the light
This is Penny Pacino, eighteen, a beatnik in a black leotard and skirt and black mascara
She has red hair
She sees Barris on the couch
Hello
Hi
Don't be alarmed    'm with Debbie
Yeah,  figured
Penny walks past him, drops her keys and bag on the counter, and enters the kitchenette
Barris watches her ass
(') You hungry
Um, no thanks
Thirsty
If you have a beer
Penny returns with two beers, hands one to Barris
She sits in a chair across from him
They both drink
() 21
: So how was sex with Debbie
've always wondered
(a little taken aback) It was good
Fine
Thanks for asking
No problem

really righteous Negro hipster
Huh
Interesting
See,  believe in the brotherhood of man
Last week  got fucked by an Oriental
(beat, studies him) What are you
Jew
That's what  thought

You look Ashkenazi (pronounced Ashkuh-Natzee), 'm guessing
Ashkenazi
Right

You're a romantic
Eh,  just don't get into all the bullshit between cats and chicks

It's quite passionate
- Penny is taking a bath in the tub in the kitchen while Barris broodingly cooks dinner at the stove
() 23
: (animatedly) so this ape and  were looking at each other
It was, like, across time and evolution
Then he began to talk, but it was a language  didn't understand, maybe Swiss
Then he turned into Perry Como, real square and
what's wrong with you
Nothing
Just because we fucked, doesn't mean there are strings now
It's okay
Okay
Okay
only wanted to tell you my dream is all
Nothing more complicated than that
Don't panic
'm just used to all this dating bullshit, y'know
Now we're a couple
Now 'm obliged to give a shit what you say
Don't worry about it, 'm not into those games either
So, anyway, this monkey turns into Perry Como and  say -- Holy fuck

Holy holy fuck

About sex
About romance
About the bullshit of dating
'  - Leonard Goldberg,  executive, sits behind his desk as Barris, holding a cardboard model of a game show set, excitedly paces the room giving a pitch
call it The Dating Game, Mr

And based on their answers, she picks one to date
And we pay for the date

Chuck
Albert's dead
Well, he led an amazingly long life
Still, it's hard to go on

: 'know, you've been staring out this window for six months now

Okay
That's what 'm doing

Ideas
Okay
You're thirty-two years old, and you have no career and no prospects
Thanks for the status report, Phoebe
Look,  just gotta come up with the right concept
Then, boom
(holds up notebook again) Which, by the way, 've almost got
You're breaking mom's heart
You know that, don't you
Barris looks out the window at his emaciated mother sitting in the yard in an old wicker-backed wheelchair and staring off into space
Somehow, and don't ask me why, Phoebe, my being born broke mom's heart
Barris watches his mother for a long moment
(') Hey Phoebe, you ever see what's-her-name, Tuvia, anymore
Who
Tuvia
Your friend
Tuvia
The girl
Oh
No
heard something
think she got divorced recently or something
Oh, yeah

- Barris knocks on the door
There is some movement inside and a woman answers the door
This is older Tuvia, 20's, attractive but a little hard-edged now
She balances a baby on her hip Yes
(registers) Well, if it isn't Strawberry-dick Barris
Hi, Tuvia
Barris taken by the changes in Tuvia
The baby and the full, milk-producing breasts get him excited
What do you want
came by to apologize
Okay then
She closes the door
He knocks again
She opens the door
(') Well, if it isn't Strawberry-dick Barris
Now what do you want
So 'm back in town
For a while thought maybe you and  could -- Jesus, you've got to be kidding
Tuvia closes the door
Barris stands there for a moment, considers knocking again, then turns and leaves
- We move along a park bench, past several homeless people, one holding an old doll, others holding other sad items
We come to Barris
He's wrapped in a horse blanket and holding the miniature cardboard Dating Game set
An open notebook sits on his lap
The pages are blank, except for one entry: The Something Else Game
Barris holds a pen poised to write, but doesn't
28
- Barris is drunk and in a fight
He is losing, flailing, swinging wildly
Jim Byrd, a middle-aged, business man- looking guy, in tinted glasses and sideburns, watches from the bar
Eventually Barris and the other brawler get thrown out of the bar
Byrd takes a sip of his drink
- Barris sits on the curb, nursing his wounds
Byrd exits the bar and casually approaches
You're a pretty angry young fella, aren't you
Can't fight worth a damn though
Screw off, fag
Don't think  haven't seen you watching me in that bar for a week now
Kind of a loner, 'd say
Fairly bright
tad anti-social
Mad at the world
Can  buy you lunch
Look, there's a schoolyard half a block down
Why don't you go trolling there
Barris gets up and starts to walk away
could teach you at least thirty different ways to kill a man with a single blow, Mr
Barris
Barris stops
(') Might help you in future bar fights
Just a thought
Barris just stands there
(') Oh, and there's money in it
Good money
Barris turns
29
- Barris and Jim Byrd sit in a booth
Barris is wolfing a hamburger
Byrd sips coffee
(mouth full) and  figure if  can keep afloat until  come up with my next game show idea, then all will be copacetic
That sounds great, Chuck
'know, 've never known a television producer before
'm impressed
Yeah, yeah
So what's this money deal you were talking about
Well,  work for a government agency, and can always use good, enthusiastic men to help me carry out my directives
What kind of work
What government agency
(matter-of-fact) Problem solving work
For the Office of Diplomatic Security
Office of what
Never heard of it
Is that the fucking  or something
Please be discreet, Mr
Barris
(whispering) Jesus, it is the fucking
Hell, 'll be a spy
Where do  sign up
Are you fucking with me
You're fucking with me, aren't you
Hardly
And you wouldn't be with the company
You'd be a contract agent

No official tie to any agency
Is that understood

As you know, 've been watching you
For years, actually
've only let you know about it for the last week
Chuck stops chewing
Jesus
'm happy to report you fit our profile, Mr
Barris
Are you interested in this work
Long pause
Well, what's the profile
Are you interested in this work, Mr
Barris
Yeah, sure,  wanna be a secret agent
Contract agent
Whatever
Get to fuck beautiful Eastern European women
Wear a trenchcoat
Sounds like a kick
The work we do is very serious
It's essential in quelling the rise of communism and allowing democracy to gain its rightful foothold around the globe
Sure
Yeah
Okay
That's good
- The place is ramshackle and overgrown
It looks deserted barbed-wire fence surrounds it
- severe-looking instructor is teaching a class to an assembled group of scary-looking men: losers, psychos, mercenaries, Latin American thugs, and Chuck Barris
() 31
: #1 There are several efficient methods of killing a man, were you to find yourself without a weapon
The edge of your hand against the adversary's Adam's apple
(demonstrates on mannequin) This will crush the windpipe causing strangulation and death
The students take notes
#1 (') Boxing your adversary's ears with proper force will cause his ear drums to burst and possibly result in bleeding in the brain
And death
- It's dark
Byrd sits on a step, smoking a cigarette
Barris approaches
You're training me to be a killer
See, Chuck,  knew you were fairly bright
can't kill people
My future is in television
Listen, you're thirty-two years old and you've achieved nothing
Jesus Christ was dead and alive again by thirty-three
Better get cracking
have ideas for shows
Oh, good
Why don't you spend another six months developing 'em while staring out the window at mommy's house next to poor dead Albert the dog
How do you know all that
() 32
: know everything about you, Chuck
For fuck's sake,  know which hand you jerk off with
Barris lifts his hands, tries to remember
(') Right
Leave in the morning, if you want
But 'm here to tell you this is honest work for good pay
You'd be helping to make the world safer
And your country would be grateful
Byrd rises, stubs out his cigarette in his hand
(') It'll toughen you up
Barris sits there staring into the blackness
- Another big, frightening instructor stands before the class
Behind him is a full-sized diagram of a man which illustrates all major arteries and organs
He is demonstrating the proper way to grip a knife, then using the knife, he points to various sites on the body
Angle on Chuck Barris
He has copied the diagram of the man in his notebook and is writing "Carotoid artery carries blood to brain
Death in seconds
" He then writes: "Game show idea: Slice of Life
Interesting
" - Several canvas dummies are propped up in the field
Barris and other students slash at the dummies with big knives
- Barris and other students are assembling rifles
- Barris and other students crawl on their bellies through mud
- The severe instructor, in a lab coat, is mixing chemicals
() 33
: #1 Glycerin is, of course, the best-known nitrating agent
Now keep in mind, nitroglycerin is extremely unstable slight tap, a one degree change in temperature and it'll blow up in your hands
Yee-haa, let's mix us up a batch
Instructor #1 holds up a beaker
#1 (') Everybody take your 75 ml beaker and fill it to the 13 ml level with fuming red nitric acid, 98% concentration
The students nervously pour nitric acid into beakers
- The severe instructor is demonstrating how to use an army field telephone to torture a man
canvas dummy is tied to a chair as the instructor attaches wires from the telephone to the dummy's genitals and to his mouth
The students watch closely, take notes
- The students with suitcases and in traveling clothes are hugging and saying good-bye
The end of summer camp tearful Barris heads toward one of the waiting buses
Byrd pulls him aside, discusses something with him
- Byrd and Barris, now dressed in a suit similar to Byrd's, sit in first class
Byrd stirs his scotch and water with his finger as he stares at nothing out the window
,      - :  , 1965 commercial airliner comes in for a landing
- Barris, Byrd, and two sleazy, sweaty men, Benitez and Brazioni, sit in a booth in the back of the dark cafe
Benitez opens up his brief case and pulls out a pile of grainy photos of a man leaving a residence and a street map
He lays them on the table
() 34
: Salvador Panagra Renda, gentlemen
Si
In the flesh
What have you got for me, Manny
(re: map) Renda leaves his apartment every day at 8:30, alone, walks east two blocks to this news kiosk, buys a paper and heads south four blocks to the plaza of the Museum Nacional to read it
Okay
Chuck, you're here at 8:25
Dress like a tourist
Start walking north
You should pass Renda here
Stop him and ask him in bad Spanish where the museum is
Make sure he doesn't understand what you're asking
Okay
(to Brazioni and Benitez) You'll be parked here
Brazioni, you're behind the wheel
Benitez, you're on the street leaning into the car chatting with Benitez
When Chuck stops Renda, you turn to help with the directions, stick a gun into Renda's ribs, and direct him into the back seat
Chuck, you get in first
Renda's between you and Benitez
Brazioni, whaddaya got
Brazioni opens a case to reveal three Walther -38 pistols
(') Nice
You got suppresers with those, 'm assuming
am not an imbecile
(smiling) Glad to hear it
Wasn't sure
() 35
: (2) (to Byrd) Where are you going to be, Jim
Poolside, Chuck
- Brazioni and Benitez are at a table, drunk, sweaty and loud, flirting with some women
Byrd sits at the bar, sipping a scotch
Barris enters, spots Byrd, sits down next to him
(not looking up) Hola, Chuckito
Que pasa
So what'd this guy Renda do anyway
It's your job to follow directives, not question their validity
It's just
He's a bad guy, Chuck
He's one of the bad guys
Okay
Bad for the
, right, Jim
Not bad in an absolute sense, just bad for the
Don't fuckin' dance with me, Barris
Renda's bad for the Tea and Biscuit Co
He's bad for me personally
You work for me, and Renda's bad for me
You're now officially a patriotic citizen of the United States of Jim Byrd
Look, this is -- Byrd grabs Barris and pulls him over to a dark corner of the room
No one looks up
He pushes Barris against the wall
There's no backing out now, Chuck
We've let you in on everything
So you don't play, you don't leave Mexico
Comprende
() 36
: was just -- (softening) like you
really do
And you're gonna do fine tomorrow
And we're gonna become great friends
And you're gonna have a very nice little career
But you've got to grow up
There's a war on
What war
(walking away) That's not your concern
- It's hot
There are two twin beds in the room
Byrd sleeps soundly in one
Barris lies in the other, eyes wide open
- Renda is buying a newspaper at the kiosk
He completes the transaction and takes a few steps with his paper
Barris blocks his way, holding a phrase book and shaking
Excusa me, por favor, Senor
Renda stops
(') Donde es-bla ra-ba-blala los bloteros
No comprende
Renda tries to get away from this pesky tourist
Barris follows him, calling after him
Ra-bla-bla-mamos las minjares
Renda picks up his pace, as does Barris
Benitez approaches
May  be of some assistance here
Renda appears relieved, until he feels the gun in his back
37
- Renda's in the back between Barris and Benitez
Brazioni drives
Renda seems pale and nervous, as does Barris in his gaudy tourist wear and sunglasses
The car drives slowly through the crowded Mexico City streets
They arrive at a jammed intersection and are suddenly confronted with a big parade
It's Day of the Dead; the streets are filled with dancing skeletons
It's wild and frightening
Brazioni glances at Renda in the reaview mirror
Day of the dead
- The car stops in a deserted field
Barris gets out first
His shirt is soaked through with sweat
Suddenly there's a commotion inside the car
Renda has gotten hold of a gun
He shoots Brazioni and Benitez
Barris panics and dives behind the car
Renda steps cautiously outside of the car, looking for Barris
Barris grabs Renda's foot
Renda falls, the gun flies from his hand
Barris kicks the gun under the car, his own gun drawn
He points the gun at Renda, who is on his stomach
Barris doesn't shoot
He's scared, shaking wildly
Renda looks up at Barris, trying to figure him out
He slowly rises to his feet, turns to Barris with a pleading look in his eyes
Por favor
No me mates, senor
Tengo tres bebes
Barris sucks in a deep gulp of air
His hand shakes
He pulls out Spansh-English dictionary
Again
Que
Repitolo
Again
No me mates
Tengo tres bebes
Barris flips through the dictionary
church bell chimes, startling Barris
His gun goes off accidentally and the bullet hits Renda in the face, tearing most of it away
Renda falls, but is still alive
He screams out of where his mouth was
wedding party emerges from the distant church
() 38
: Oh Christ
Oh crap
Barris tries to stop Renda from screaming by covering the hole in Renda's face
Barris throws up, some of it landing on Renda's pants
He wipes his own mouth with his bloody hand and looks at the still screaming Renda
The churchgoers are starting to squint in Barris's direction
Barris shoots Renda again
And again and again and again and again
More blood spatters Barris's clothing and face
The church bell continues to chime
- Barris and Byrd sit side-by-side in first class
This time Barris has the window seat and stares out
Beautiful country, isn't it
Yeah
You did us proud, Chuck
Barris doesn't say anything
(') Renda was a bad guy
He really was
Yeah
- Barris enters carrying an overnight bag and some mail
He flips on the hall light and stares at himself in a mirror
(
) had changed
could see it in my eyes
Something dark
Barris notices a fleck on the side of his nose
It's dried blood
He distractedly rubs at it
- Renda's contorted face in close-up as he is shot
Blood spurting
Echoey church bells chime
No me mates
Yo tengo tres bebes
39
- Barris puts down his bag, pulls the Spanish-English dictionary from his pocket, and tries to translate what Renda said
It takes him a while but he does
"Don't kill me
am three babies
" am three babies
What the fuck does that mean
(studies dictionary) Oh
" have three babies
" Oh, God
Barris drops to the floor and throws up into a trash can
Out of the corner of his eye, he catches a movement in the living room
He lurches backwards, knocks over the can
Vomit spills onto the carpet
(
) (groggily) Chuck, is that you throwing up
In the dim light from the hallway, Barris spots Penny lying on the couch
She is dressed as a hippy
backpack and a duffel lie on the floor next to her
Jesus Christ, Penny
You scared the shit out of me
What are you doing here
Sorry
just been crashing here for a few days
Waiting for you
Where you been, man, where you been
Mexico
Just on a little vaca
You drank the water, didn't you
Yeah
You're not supposed to
Montessori's Revenge
You're not even allowed to open your mouth or your eyes when you take a shower
It's crazy
How come our water is so good and their water is poison
It's the same ocean
() 40
: don't know
It's weird, huh
(beat, then proudly) So 'm a hippy now
Look
Penny stands in the dimness to show off her outfit
(') 've been in San Francisco, and it's amazing
Everybody loves everybody and there's lots of colors
We're gonna change the world, Chuck
Come back with me and be my old man, okay
Not that old
Ha ha ha
Penny, 'm a little tired now, so
Oh
You gotta hear this song
Penny shrieks excitedly as she runs to the record player
She turns it on, plugs in a strobe light
"Sunshine Superman" starts up
Penny sings and dances along, directing the lyrics at Barris
Barris looks around at his strobing apartment
He sees Penny's mess: pot paraphenalia, anti-war posters, a gold dove painted on the wall with a phone number underneath
(') (singing) "Cause  made my mind up, you're going to be mine
" Penny, what did you do to my wall
(looking) Oh, it's a guy who called a couple a days ago
Gold-Bird
Isn't it pretty
Leonard Goldberg
You're kidding
(dials phone anxiously) Hello, this is Chuck Barris returning for Leonard Goldberg
Pause
Barris paces
Penny sings and dances in background
() 41
: (2) ( ) Hi, Chuck
Mr
Goldberg
'm so sorry  didn't get back to you right away
was out of town
Vacationing in Mexico
Good for you
Listen, Chuck
We've ended up with a damn hole in our daytime schedule
've been reviewing some options, and it occurred to me there might be a place here for you and your baby
My baby, Mr
Goldberg
The Dating Game
(joshingly) That is your baby, isn't it, Chuck
Yes sir, it is
Are you still interested
Yes sir
Very interested
Sir
Good man
We'll need to start airing in about six weeks
Is that do-able for you and your people
My people
Six weeks
Sure
Yes sir
Great
Keep me posted
Dial tone
Barris sits there, phone in hand, then throws up again into the trash can
Penny stops dancing, watches
Damn Mexicans and their water
42
- An episode of the show is being taped
Barris paces nervously behind the camera
Bachelor number two, what would  like most about you
am very romantic and  would send you flowers every day
The studio audience "awwws
" Aww
That's sweet
Bachelor number three, what would  like most about you
- My big cock
The bachelorette makes a mock-horrified expression as the studio audience erupts in laughter
Barris buries his face in his hands
- brunette bachelorette asks a question
Bachelor number one, what nationality are you
Well, my father is Welsh and my mother is Hungarian, so  guess that makes me Well- Hung
The audience goes wild
Barris pulls at his hair
- black bachelorette asks a question
Bachelor number three,  play the trombone
If  blew you, what would you sound like
The audience screams with delight
43
- Leonard Goldberg, a bunch of network executives, and Barris sit around a conference table and watch a tv
On it is The Dating Game
black bachelor is responding to the trombone question
He simulates the receiving of a blow job, moaning and writhing in his seat as the studio audience howls
Barris has his head in his hands
Goldberg signals an assistant, who switches off the television
The executives look quite grim
Chuck, quite frankly these episodes are unairable
Look, Len, the show's spontaneous, it's unscripted
That's it's charm
can't control what people say
Be that as it may, Mr
Barris, we can't have black men getting blow jobs on national television
The point isn't that he's black, Hank
(beat) Well,  know that
That's not what meant
Look, Len, nobody is indifferent to these shows
Right
And that's good
Show business must avoid indifference at all costs
Even when taste is involved
Taste is just a word
You don't fuck with taste, my friend
(uncomprehending) What does that even mean
don't even under -- () 44
: Chuck, we cannot air this stuff
That's it
If you can't figure out how to retain your spontaneity without the contestants being lewd, we're going to have to pull the show
- Barris is drunk and brooding
He picks a fight with a big man who has unintentionally knocked into him at the bar
Barris is brutal and effective, utilizing the techniques he learned from one of the scary instructors at training camp
This gives him an idea
- The contestants are onstage
Barris appears, warm and charming
Hi, folks
Before we begin taping today, 'd like to introduce you to Mr
Peter Jenks of the Federal Communications Commission
The severe training camp instructor joins Barris onstage
#1 (increasingly psychotic) Thank you, Mr
Barris
don't know if any of you are aware of this, but it's a federal offense to make licentious remarks on a network television broadcoast
The penalty for this disgusting, un-American behavior is one year in prison or a ten thousand dollar fine or both
Anyone making a sick, subversive remark tonight will be arrested immediately
will then personally escort the offender to federal prison for booking under edict number 364 of the Broadcast Act of 1963
And it's a long drive to that prison
Just you and me
No other witnesses -- (jumping in) Any questions
There are none
The contestants are paralyzed with fear
Jenks is red-faced, trembling
() 45
: (') Okay
Have fun, everybody
' - The actual Barris being interviewed
Sometimes as a younger man  stretched the truth to get what  wanted
"Through all the lying days of my youth/ swayed my leaves and flowers in the sun;/Now may whither into the truth
" Yeats
You heard of him
(
) Yeah
Of course
Sure you have
(beat) Anyway, my little lie worked
We aired and become a big hit
phenomenon, really
' ,   - :  ,  , 1967 This is the sixties and the office is crazily appointed
Street signs, funny posters, faux Tiffany lamps, mobiles, lava lamps, an inflatable sex doll, etc
Barris, 36, is behind his desk, feet up and on the phone
He wears a t- shirt and jeans and loafers
This is a new Barris, confident and successful and hip and relaxed and slovenly
Outside in the bullpen area we hear the hustle and bustle, laughing and screaming of a busy but casual office
(into phone) Terrific, Rod
Yeah, 'll get back to you on Monday
Great
Thanks
Bye
Barris hangs up the phone
His jovial facade disappears
He opens up his ice bucket
It's empty
(') (yelling) Ice
Ice
Ice
Ice
Ice
Loretta, Barris's pretty young secretary, enters with a new bucket of ice
She is braless and shoeless
() 46
: Jesus, Barris, take a Darvon
Loretta drops the bucket of ice on his desk
Barris grabs her arm, pulls her toward him, kisses her on the back of the neck
Hey, baby
Loretta acts annoyed, but it's playful
Asshole
know
Sit
Talk to me
Loretta sighs and drops into a bean bag chair
Barris puts some ice in a glass and pours himself a scotch
'm busy
We're in the middle of a bachelorette crisis out there
just got a call from the network
Drink
You got any weed
wish
Then 'll have a drink
Bad news
Barris pours a drink for Loretta
She gets up, takes it off the desk and falls back down into the bean bag
The Tammy Grimes Show is being pulled from Saturday night
(mock concern) Oh my God
(drily) So
() 47
: (2) They want to put a prime-time version of the Dating Game on in its place
Shit
You're kidding
That's fucking great
But they say the day-time version's not hot enough
They want me to make it more exciting for night-time
got forty- eight hours
What do you have so far
Nothing
Bupkis
mean, the show is what it is
don't have a clue
This could be my big break, Loretta
Yeah,  know
Don't blow it
Loretta smiles at him, downs her drink, gets up and pads out of the office
Barris watches her ass
Thank you for your help
(not looking back) Hey,  brought the ice
She is out the door
Barris picks up his guitar and noodles on it
- Barris paces on the darkened set
He is trying to think shadowy figure appears at the top of the bleachers and creeps down the aisle
Barris is deep in thought and doesn't hear
The man appears behind Barris and locks his arm around Barris's neck
Barris is startled, choking and flailing trying to remove the arm
He can't
Finally the man releases Barris and tweaks his crotch
Barris turns wildly around
It is Jim Byrd
Boy, didn't  teach you anything
() 48
: You son of a bitch
Barris swings at Byrd
Byrd easily blocks the punch
You're so rusty, it's embarrassing
You're a stupid fucking turd, you know that
Can  buy you lunch
' - Jim is downing his bourbon and signals the waitress for another
Barris, still pissed, sips a martini
Ah, lighten up, hombre
My fucking neck hurts
Okay
Poor baby
Look, 've been put in charge of a fairly large wet operation and could use your help
Have you noticed, Jim, 've got a tv show on the air
don't need to kill people for hire anymore
know you don't need to
But you'd like to
That's insane
Byrd shrugs, unconvinced
He sips his drink
Think of it as a hobby
An avocation
Something you do to relax
You can be an assassination enthusiast, a murder bug
() 49
: 've got important things to think about here
don't have time to fuck around with you
Okay, 'll help you out with your little show
Tit for tat
That's the kinda guy am
've seen this Dating Game of yours, Chuck
And  have a thought
What, now you're a television producer
Hey, 'm  operative John
Public when it comes to tv and that should make my opinion of interest to you
Let's hear it then
Well, what do you have now
The couple gets sent to some stupid second-rate Hollywood shitcan restaurant, right
Sets you back fifty bucks
That's not too exciting a prize to us vicarious- living boobs out in -land
Yeah, what's your point
Up the stakes, Chuckles
Send 'em to some exotic locale
Europe, Southeast Asia, for example
The network's not going to let me send two unmarried kids on vacation together
(shrugs) Send 'em with a chaperone
Some respectable old lady with a sewn closed snatch
(considering) 'know, that's not half bad
() 50
: (2) 'm telling ya
And
And sometimes you can be the chaperone, Chuckie
Let's say we have a job for you in Austria
You, a successful tv producer, above suspicion, chaperones the young couple, and while you're there, blam
you take care of some Company business
It's the perfect cover
producer by day,  operative by night
told you,  don't have to kill people for money anymore
Chuck, when  said you fit our profile, very little of that had to do with you needing the money
Some of it, but very little
You liked it with Renda, Chuck
saw it in your eyes
You liked it but you botched it
Don't you want to get really good at something, Chuck
Barris stares at Byrd
(  ) - The director calls the shots
Barris stands in the back watching the show in progress
On the stage is a pretty blonde bachelorette in a short black dress and three bachelors
Bachelors two and three are attractive and stylishly dressed and groomed
Bachelor one is a fat, not- too-bright looking guy in a yellow-ochre leisure suit
His slow, unfocused delivery contrasts with the fast, sharp chatter in the booth
(rapidly) Ready one, take one
Ready three, take three
Ready one, take one
Number one, can you please tell me what a girl is like who hasn't been on a date before and how you can tell she hasn't been on a date before
Ready two, take two
This guy has never been on a date
Everyone in the booth laughs
() 51
: Well
Jesus, she's gotta pick this guy
This is just too good
'll ask her what she likes to do and -- Ready one, take one
Ready two, take two
And if she doesn't know what she likes to do -- Ready three, take three
The only date he's ever had is with his right hand
Guys in booth laugh, except Barris
then 'll know she hasn't done it yet
- :    , 1967 It's all mod and colorful
Chuck Barris shuffles along, taking in the sights with the Dating Game couple
The blonde bachelorette did indeed pick the fat guy
But it's clear she thinks she made a mistake and pays him no attention whatsoever, walking about twenty feet in front of him and Barris
Barris seems bored
- Barris enters the pub alone
He's dressed in a blonde wig and moustache and glasses
It's crowded and he searches the room for someone
He spots a pretty young woman by herself at a table
She wears white go-go boots
Excuse me, is this seat taken
By you
() 52
: Barris sits across from the woman
London is wonderful this time of year, isn't it
Yes it is
(beat) Oh
Sorry
Barris gets up, glances around, spots another pretty young woman in white go-go boots, sitting by herself
He approaches her
(') Excuse me, is this seat taken
By you
Barris sits
London is wonderful this time of year, isn't it
Especially the fog
It affords one solitude, even in a city full of people
'm Chuck
Yes,  gathered
And you are
(smiles) Here you go, Chuck
She hands him a manila envelope, and stands to leave
At least give me a made-up name
Something for me to cry out during those dark nights of the soul
() 53
: (2) Cry out, "Olivia
" That's Twelfth Night
Very good, Chuck
'm pleasantly surprised
You're not like the other murderers
She smiles and leaves
Barris watches after her, then opens the envelope and pulls out a black and white photo of a man
- It's raining
bored Barris, dressed normally, waits with the fat bachelor under an umbrella near the entrance
The fat bachelor checks his watch
thinks he's really pretty and  want to be her boyfriend
- Barris, in wig and moustache, stands in the middle of the empty, dark courtyard
(loud whisper) Here
Barris approaches
Do you have it
Do you have it
Sorry
Yeah
Barris reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out an envelope
The Englishman takes it, opens it, pulls out a wad of cash and counts
(') Don't worry, we're not gonna cheat you
Just the same
() 54
: The Englishman finishes counting the money, pockets it, and hands Barris a box of Polaroid film
Thank you
Oh, one more thing
Barris pulls out his automatic with attached silencer and jams it into the Englishman's mouth
The silencer breaks the man's front teeth
The man makes a muffled grunt
(') Sorry about your teeth
The Englishman's eyes are wide with terror
Barris pulls the trigger three times
The back of the Englishman's head explodes
Blood and hair and brain are spattered against the church wall
The Englishman slumps to the ground
Barris reaches into the man's jacket, pulls out the envelope of money, pockets it, and makes his way toward the churchyard gate
There stands the fat bachelor, watching, confused
After the initial shock, Barris smiles warmly
(') It's Ronnie, isn't it
The fat bachelor nods
(') 'mere, Ronnie
want to show you something neat
It's okay
The fat bachelor enters the courtyard
- felt bad about Ronnie
But really did that ugly, fat, stupid kid a favor
He was ugly and fat and stupid
More life wouldn't have changed that for him
No woman would ever have loved him
That's just the brutal truth, y'know
- Barris enters the room, shaky and scared
- Barris rips open the Polaroid box, pulls out the foil paper that protects the film, rips that open and pulls out a small white plastic vial
Barris greases the vial with Vaseline and sticks it up his ass
() 55
: He looks at himself in the mirror, naked and pathetic
There is a knock at the door
He stiffens, grabs his gun and pads out of the bathroom
- Barris peeks out the peephole
We see a fish-eye view of Patricia Watson
Olivia
It's Patricia, actually
: - Barris and Patricia sit sipping champagne
Both are drunk
and so then  spent a year in Operation Chaos, inside the anti-war movement as an agent provocateur, nudging it toward violence in order to discred it
That was fun
got to wear granny glasses
Sounds fun
So tell me, Patricia, why'd you come up here tonight
don't know
You're sort of cute in a homely way
And it's always lonely when that civilian you're fucking calls out the name off your fake passport
"All the information  have about myself is from forged documents
" Nabokov
Barris is thrilled and kisses her
It begins to turn hot and heavy
Suddenly Barris pulls away
Actually,  just gotta go into the bathroom and take care of something
() 56
: No, baby
Leave the microfilm in
- plane lands
,  - Barris waits sweatily in line with a small a carry-on suitcase
When the line moves, he walks as if perhaps he has something up his ass
customs agent walks past the line with a dog
The dog sniffs Barris's ass in passing
- Barris steps out of the terminal
black limo pulls up
The back door opens and Barris gets in
- Seated in the back are Jim Byrd and Simon Oliver, 50
Oliver is pure ivy league with a pipe
When he speaks it is with an affected British accent
Byrd is pissy
Hey, buddy
This is Simon Oliver
Hey
Everything go okay
You don't look too good
Mr
Barris, do not ever again jeopardize one of my missions by killing a game show contestant
Is that understood
You're welcome, pal
Do  make myself clear
Fuck you
They're my contestants
Amateur
() 57
: Faggot
Chuck -- Lovely
Tell me, Mr
Barris, are you in possession of my microfilm
Yeah,  got it
Let's have it then
It's up my ass, Oliver
Why don't you reach on up there and get it
Oliver tamps his pipe
Byrd stares down at his thumbs
(') just feel  deserve some appreciation for my efforts
What do you think Patricia Watson was
Barris looks at Byrd
Byrd almost imperceptibly shakes his head "no
" Prick
- Barris, now in t-shirt and jeans, shuffles through the busy bullpen area
Employees wave, say "hi", give Barris the peace sign
He returns the gestures, but halfheartedly
He seems depressed
Loretta sidles up beside him
Well, if isn't the hitman
(turning, wild-eyed) What
Hitman
Hitman
Hitman
Hitman

: said, well, if it isn't the hitman
Just heard through the grapevine that is going to pick up The Newlywed Game
You're kidding me
Not kidding you
Day-time and prime- time
Oh, fuck, Loretta
That's sensational
Barris kisses Loretta
Hitman
Hitman
Hitman
Barris joins them chanting "Hitman" and dances around the office
- The Newlywed Game was based on my theory that almost any American would sell out their spouse for a washer-drier or a lawnmower you can ride on
Such was my respect for that most holy of unions must've been on to something, because the show aired for thirteen years
- Barris speeds through the curvy streets of the Hollywood Hills
Penny Pacino, dressed as a hippy, sits in the front passenger seat
:  , 1969 Great wheels, man
Yeah,  decided to start treating myself right
You spend so much time denying yourself things
Life's too short
Yeah,  really gork what you're saying, man
() 59
: You really grok what 'm saying, man
Not gork
Oh
(beat) Really
The car screeches to a halt in front of a fancy house with a "For Sale, Open House" sign out front
- The house is empty
Barris and Penny are greeted at the door by a real estate agent
(looking around) Outa sight
Buy this one
Hi
Welcome, folks
If you wouldn't mind signing-in on our sheet over th -- 'll take it
'm sorry
'll take the house
Yay
Penny happily kisses Barris
(beat) Very good, sir
- Barris and Penny are having sex on the floor
So, man, are you seeing anyone
Nobody serious
You
() 60
: No
think we should get married
Aw, Pen, don't start -- No, listen, it makes sense
You and feel exactly the same about marriage, right
How much bullshit it is, right
And the odds of us finding someone else with the exact same view on it are small
So, it makes sense
- Barris, 50, types away
He is sweaty and naked except for a towel draped over his head
(
) liked Penny
even loved her in my way
But the idea of tying myself down for the rest of my life
remember my parents' marriage
: - Barris, five, sits at the dinner table with his parents
His father, dressed in a dental smock, stares down at his plate as he eats
His mother absently chews and stares vacantly into space
We need a new ice box
The father shrugs
- The set, which holds four couples, divides in the middle to reveal a new refrigerator
brand new Amana refrigerator-freezer with automatic ice maker
One of the couples is cheering and screaming hysterically, happy and in love and kissing
The other couples look disappointed and angry at their spouses
We pull back to reveal we're watching this on a tv in: 61
'  - The office is filled to capacity with with hippy-like employees watching The Newlywed Game
Many sit on the floor, jammed up against each other
few women are nursing infants
Someone passes a joint
Barris sits behind his desk, with a "Make Love Not War" helmet on his head, his feet up, and a guitar in his lap
Beautiful
Did you see that
How much they loved each other just then
That's what it's all about, kiddies
Everyone agrees
Someone switches off the tv
(') Okay, guys, new business
We're winning our slots every week
Everyone cheers
(') But that means we need you Bandits to get on the contestant mill
Our supply of dumbfucks is lagging behind our demand for dumbfucks
And 'm gonna be introducing three new shows in the coming months: The Parent Game, The Game Game, and the Dollar Ninety-Eight Beauty Pageant, so we're gonna really need you guys to carry your weight
Nuff said
Any other business
#1 Yeah
Rick took four slices of pizza at lunch yesterday
Everyone else only got two
Oooh
Is that true, Rick
Where are you
Here
No, it's not true
Any other witnesses to this alleged infraction
#2 saw it
He took four
only got one
() 62
: Rick, you're dead meat, buddy
(shoots Rick with finger) sentence you to
dance for us in today's post-meeting version of "Out of Limits" featuring the musical stylings of the  Stompers
Everyone cheers
Aw, Chuck
Get up here, you rascule, you
Rick heads up to Barris's desk
Everyone laughs
few employees have joined Barris at his desk with instruments
They break into a raucous banjo version of "Out of Limits
" Rick dances
Everyone's laughing and clapping
As "Out of Limits" continues, now the actual version, we see montage of Barris shooting, stabbing, and garroting various foreign-looking people in strange, murky locations intercut with Barris having sex with Patricia Watson in different bedrooms and motel rooms, Barris dancing with Patricia in various exotic locales, and Barris on the set for his many game shows, happily directing the bustling activity
-   - The actual Jim Lange, host of The Dating Game
Sometimes Chuck would just disappear for weeks
remember once we had a conflict on the set over the right way to throw that kiss at the end of the show, y'know
(demonstrates kiss) and Chuck was just not reachable to resolve it
(
) What was the conflict
Look, it's water under the bridge
'm not gonna talk about it
63
'   - The previously bare room is now filled with lovely and expensive furnishings
But Barris and Penny are again on the floor, now playing Scrabble by candlelight
Penny lays down some tiles: ------- The word's interpret
Interpet
Interpret
Well, do you have an extra "r" then could borrow
'm not going to give you a letter
You're lucky  don't make you forfeit a turn
Oh
Okay
Penny retrieves her letters and studies the board
Barris empties the wine into Penny's glass
There wasn't much left
'll run to the store and get some more
All right
Don't cheat
You neither
- Barris pulls up in a Jaguar  convertible
pretty, innocent-looking young woman, Monica, is emerging with a big laundry bag from the laundromat next to the liquor store
She glances, momentarily, at the Jaguar and at Barris
64
'   - Barris enters with a bottle of wine
Penny is in the same position on the floor
Intrepet's a word, right
Intrepid
Shit fuck piss
(concentrating) Okay okay okay
Pen, we should call it a night
'm kinda tired
You're tired
got a date
Since when
just met this girl
Like, just now
You mean just now
Yeah
Kinda
Well, that's rude
Sorry
Yeah, well, see ya
Penny picks up her bag and exits in a huff
'   - It's a young woman's apartment, small and girly
The doorbell rings
() 65
: Monica, clearly not out of her teens, enters the room and answers the door
Barris stands there with the bottle of wine
Hi
Hi
Wow, this is a beautiful place you got
Barris enters, looks around
There's another teenage girl in pajamas in the kitchenette, mixing tuna salad
Hi
Hi
Chuck, this is Mindy, one of my roommates
Hi
Have a seat
Barris sits on the couch
Monica sits next to him
Mindy is in the background, futzing around in the kitchen area
(') So
have you accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior, Chuck
(beat) Yes,  have
: '   - Barris, Monica, and Mindy sit on the couch watching a religious show on television
66
- Yeah,  remember that religious girl, sure
Monica Something
Fleming
Oh God, she had the softest, fleeciest clam ever experienced
It took a little more work than usual, but  got in there, baby
(smacks lips, then stares off into space) It was some clam
Oh Lordy
You get old, y'know, but the taste for soft clam, it just doesn't go away
This is the great tragedy of getting old
- The room is abuzz with activity
Lots of people on the phone talking
potential Newlywed Game couple being interviewed
Monica sits in the waiting area, eavesdrops on the interview with the Newlywed Couple
Getting married to Alan is the best thing 've ever done
It's just so wonderful knowing that you've got someone by your side through everything for he rest of your life
The couple kisses
'kay, Mon
He's off
Monica enters the office
'  - Monica enters
Barris wears a deerstalker cap
My sweet little clamato
Monica leans down and kisses Barris
'm pregnant
Barris's eye twitches
() 67
: (') (crying) can't be pregnant, Chuck
Is it mine
Monica looks at him incredulously, flings an ashtray at him, misses
She sits at the desk, looks glumly out the window
can't believe you asked me that
know
'm sorry
(beat) But you're sure, right
hate you so much right now
Look, we'll take care of it
How
Are you gonna marry me
(carefully) Well, no
Not at this point
'm not murdering my baby
(weeping) can't
do that
Please
Barris sighs
He touches Monica's hand
- Barris and Monica sit in first class
Barris stares out the window
Monica stares straight ahead
Beautiful country, isn't it
- Barris leads a crying Monica down the garbage-strewn alley
They find a doorway
Barris opens it
Here we are
() 68
: (collapsing) can't  can't  can't  can't
Barris supports her and leads her into the office
It's okay
It'll be okay
,  - Barris and Penny walk sadly through the garden
What a waste
Tell me about it
figure over the years  must've spent close to twenty grand on these abortions: airfare, hotels, doctors, gifts
That's not what  meant
And  don't even know how many of these fetuses were mine
That's what really kills me
- - ,
#1 It was his
#2 Yeah
It was his
#3 It wasn't his
lied
#4 Yes, it was his baby
#5 Yeah
#6 The godamn son of a bitch
He asked you to ask me this
() 69
: #7 was screwing a lot of guys at the time
It coulda been his
#8 Uh-uh
just needed someone to pay for it
He was a wallet with legs
#9 Yeah,  was just a kid
It ruined my life
- don't really want to talk about this
We hold on a silent Barris
- Barris and Penny walk in silence
So 'm assuming this means Monica is out of the picture
Yeah,  got baptized for nothing
Chuck,  was thinking
have this plan now, now that you're free -- God, you look cute today
always look cute
Don't distract me
What was  going to say
don't know
You do know
(enthusiastically charged) Chuck, why don't we get married
We've known each other forever
We've fucked each other forever
You think 'm cute, you just said
You always come to me when you're in trouble
And you're almost forty, Chuck
() 70
: Barris turns violently toward Penny
(shouting) know how old  almost am
That's it
Don't ever ask me to marry you again
(quietly) won't
'  - Barris and Penny are having sex
It is gentle and quiet
Penny is crying, trying to conceal it
Barris notices
'm sorry  yelled at you today, Pen
'm not crying because you yelled at me
This is it, isn't it
This is us
Barris studies Penny's face in the dim light
- The actual Barris puffs on his cigar
almost asked Penny to marry me right then
But  didn't
- Barris sits naked on the bed, swigging from a bottle of vodka, as a prostitute in a black dress and veil sings "Happy Birthday" to him
When she's done, she lifts the veil, looks confused
Is that right
'  - Barris sits staring out the window
His mood is somber
On the table beside him are many birthday cards
The anarchic and youthful decor of the office seems to mock Barris now
Loretta enters
Chuck
() 71
: No response
(') Chuck
(not turning) Uh
Rod Flexner's here
Shit piss fuck, send him in
Flexner enters
He's a suit
Chuck
Great to see you
What's up, Rod
Well, the thing is, Chuck, some of your shows aren't doing too well in the old ratings war
The Family Game, for one
Okay
We move into Barris's eyes
The show is in progress
Suddenly shots are fired from offstage
The host and contestants are slaughtered
It's bloody and violent
'  - We're on Barris's eyes
And How's Your Mother-in-Law is, quite frankly, in the toilet, Chuck
'  -- mother-in-law is being garotted with piano wire
Her neck is sliced
Blood spurts
72
'  - Now, as you know, Dream Girl is flailing terribly
Dream Girls lie bloody and flailing all over the set
'  - And The Game Game has no life in it at all
The contestants on the set are all bloody and dead
An applause light flashes on and off, but the audience members are also dead
'  - So 've been put in the unfortunate position of having to inform you that the network is canceling all four of these shows
Now don't shoot me, Chuck, 'm just the messenger
- Barris drinks alone
He's sullen and sauced
(to bartender) They killed my babies
Just like that
pushed them into the world through the birth canal of my imagination
Lovingly
Tenderly
Where's the humanity of these people
The fucking bastards
What am  gonna do now
(sees pretty woman) Hey there, can  buy you a drink
() 73
: What are you blind, asshole
This lady's with me
(screaming) Fuck you
The large man stands to face Barris
He is very large
Barris stands
The man swings at Barris
Barris easily deflects the punch, grabs the man's forearm and breaks it with a sickening crack
The man screams
Barris gets him in a chokehold from behind
The man whimpers and gags
(') Let's see, if  remember correctly, the next move breaks your neck, which kills you instantly or paralyzes you
Depending on your luck
Please
(lets go) Get out of here, you pussy faggot piece of shit dog-shit shithead
The large man hurries from the bar
Everyone in the bar, including the large man's date, watches Barris
(') (to the woman) Hi
'm Chuck Barris, tv producer
Have you ever done any acting
'   - Barris and the woman from the bar are having sex on the couch
Penny enters
Hey,  was just in the -- Penny sees Barris and the woman
(') What is she doing here, man
She's -- () 74
: This is our house, man
Our house
It's one thing to go elsewhere for your pussy needs
But this is our house
This is not our house, it's my house
It's our house
found it with you decorated it for you
spent six months sitting on that fucking couch she's fucking you on, fucking waiting for the fucking plumbers to come
God, you are such an asshole
Penny throws the house key at Barris
It hits him in the forehead
Then she turns and storms from the house
Barris looks over at the woman
She looks confused
should go
This doesn't feel right
The woman stands, grabs her purse, pulls out an 8x10 glossy of herself and hands it to Barris, then exits
Barris stares at the photo for a moment, then opens a drawer and puts on top of a pile of similar photos
'   - Barris pulls up, gets out of his car, and heads toward the building
- Barris walks down the hall, carrying a bouquet of flowers
He arrives at Penny's door
There is an envelope attached to it with Barris's name on it
He opens the envelope and reads the letter
Dear Chuck, 'm dead now
hope you're happy
The door's open
Love always, Penny Barris hurriedly opens the door, enters the apartment looks around, finds Penny face down on the floor, surrounded by empty champagne bottles and vials of pills
He stares at her body for a moment, feeling faint
He drops to his knees
() 75
: (face down) Wanna see a stupid girl vomit
- Barris and Penny sit in a booth
Penny has black coffee in front of her
She is pale and drawn
Why were you with that girl in our living room
It's not our living room, Pen
That's your defense
You know what it feels like to see you with someone else
In any living room
You know who  am, Penny
don't force you to hang around
(incredulous) You don't force me
Fuck
So you're saying you have no interest in this, one way or the other
No, 'm not saying that
Well, then, what are you saying, Chuck
Do you want me around or not
Do you even like me
Of course  like you
How much
What
need to know how much you like me
() 76
: (beat) don't even know what that means, "how much
" How can  rate a person in that way
That's ridiculous
You could if you felt it
If you felt it, it would be easy to rate me
You could spread your arms as wide as they would go and say, "This much, Penny
" Everything's complicated, Pen
Nothing's black and white like that
Do you want me around or not
If you don't, just say so, so  know
Okay
Barris and Penny look at each other
She starts to cry
love you, Pen, in my way
Maybe not in that crazy, head-over-heels thing, but what is that, anyway
Romantic love
Isn't that just an illusion
(beat) But you just said you love me, right
- non-descript American car is parked on the quiet wooded street
Barris pulls up in his Jaguar
He gets out of the car, looks in the window of the empty American car
(
) Over here, Strawberry-dick
Barris looks over and makes out Byrd sitting on a rock with a view of
spread out in front of him
Barris joins him
Jesus, how do you know these things
We even know what she actually thought it tasted like
() 77
: Really
could never find that out
What did she think
It's a "need to know", my friend
So tell me, what can  do you for
could really use an assignment, Jim
To straighten my head
got something for your head
Dating Game couple waits anxiously for host Jim Lange to announce their destination
and we're the sending the two of you for three days and three nights to beautiful
West Berlin
The couple screams excitedly by reflect, but as the destination sinks in, their perplexity becomes apparent
- Barris and the Dating Game couple walk along
It's cold and gray and they all wear heavy coats
The couple wear cameras around their necks
Nobody looks happy
- Barris sits in the corner of this noisy, smoky place
He has a stein of beer and reads a paper as a group of drunken Germans in the background sing a song
Patricia Watson approaches and sits
Barris looks up and smiles
Treesh
Leibchen
(kisses him, sits) So, here's what we got
Name's Hans Colbert
(pulls out photos) Other side of the wall
We don't like him very much
() 78
: (singing Toot-toot-tootsie) Bye-bye, Colbert, bye-bye
You'll work with a kraut named Keeler
He's been trailing Colbert for a month now
Knows the routine
Keeler's a drunk, so you stay sober and take charge
(collecting photos) Done and done
See you after
Prove how much you love me, baby
Kill for me
Then 'm all yours
- Barris crawls through a long dirt tunnel
Telephone cables run along the floor
An occasional bare bulb lights the way
- middle-aged man stands in his underwear at a mirror and shaves
The stall shower pushes away from the wall revealing a hole
Barris steps through it, covered in dust
He nods at the shaving man
He nods back, hands Barris a gun and a change of clothes, and continues shaving
- Barris exits the apartment building in the clean clothes
We see the East Berlin side of the wall in the background car pulls up and Barris gets in
,   - Barris sits in the parked car with Keeler, a heavyset, silent German man with nicotine stained fingers and teeth
He is constantly smoking and writing in a tiny notebook
There is a long silence
What you writing, Sig
am keeping track of all the goings on on this street
Barris looks out the window
There is nothing going on, yet Keeler keeps writing
More silence
() 79
: Hey, Keeler, a bird just flew by
Yah
know how to do my job
: - Barris and Keeler are still in the car
Keeler continues to smoke and write
well-rested, happy-looking Colbert walks by with a group of people
: - Barris looks even more sickly
Colbert rides by happily on a tandem bike with a lovely woman on the back
Keeler continues to smoke and write
: - Barris and Keeler wait in the car
Colbert emerges from his house, alone, and walks toward the car
drained Barris sighs a sigh of relief, then suddenly and with unexpected force, Keeler swings open the passenger door
The door hits a stunned Colbert and sends him flying
Keeler races around the car, grabs Colbert, throws him into the back seat, and jumps on top of him
Barris watches, surprised at the dramatic personality shift in Keeler
Keeler is strangling Colbert
cigarettes is dangling casually from his lips as he does this
Keeler turns Colbert over so he's facing him, so he can watch him die
(calmly to Barris) Under the seat, please
Barris reaches under the seat, pulls out a Polaroid camera
(') Please, if you don't mind, a photograph
To remember
Barris is stunned, scared
He takes the photo
The flash illuminates the bulging-eyed Colbert and the calm Keeler
80
- Barris types
knock at the door
He looks up, panicked
(falsetto) Who is it
(
) Housekeeping, Mr
Barris
Barris looks around
The place is a disaster
Food wrappers, crumpled papers, liquor bottles, strewn clothing, plastic army men set up for battle
He gets up, puts on a hotel bathrobe and his hat, grabs his gun, checks the peephole for a long moment, and answers the door
The housekeeper is plump and kind-looking
Good morning, Mrs
Reynolds
(looking around) Another rough night, huh
(tapping his head) The human psyche is a wondrous thing
(smiling maternally) Yes,  know it is
(taking gun) We don't need this now, do we
Why don't we just put this away
She puts the gun in a drawer, starts to pick up
Barris watches her, then: Mrs
Reynolds, may  rest my head on your bosom for a little while
Oh, that doesn't really seem like a very good idea, Mr
Barris
'm sorry
You're right
just
'm just without
comfort of any sort, and please forgive me
() 81
: (smiles at him) No harm done
Barris smacks himself in the head
(bowing) Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
You are a scholar and
It's fine, sir
Mrs
Reynolds, what do you suppose God thinks of someone like me
God
Yes, God
Well, Mr
Barris, your television shows have brought laughter and joy to millions of people
That's a very important thing,  think, in these difficult times
would imagine God likes you very much
Barris smiles a rubber-band smile
Thank you, that's very kind
(glances at her ample bosom) So
should get back to
Yes, of course, sir
Don't mind me
Barris resumes typing
The housekeeper cleans
- hollow-eyed Barris approaches the building that conceals the tunnel entrance
Suddenly there's a commotion on the quiet street
The shaving man is being led handcuffed out of the building by two trench-coated men
They shove him into a car
Barris continues to walk by, betraying no interest
He glances casually into the entranceway of the apartment building
Another trenchcoated man waits inside the shadows
() 82
: The car drives away
Barris stops at the end of the block, stares at the imposing wall
'm really, really fucked
Another car pulls up next to him
Picard, a        serious-looking Frenchman, sticks his head out the window
Get in
What
Who the hell are you
No time
Get in or die
Barris hesitates, gets in
The car screeches off
'  - Picard drives fast
Barris eyes him suspiciously, fingers his gun
Picard spots a Fiat in his rearview mirror
Merde
They know who you are, Monsieur Barris
It is their intention to kill you very much in East Berlin
Barris checks in the passenger side mirror
Merde
Not to worry, my friend
Picard speeds up dramatically, but continues to drive calmly
Barris is agitated
(') am Paul Picard, by the way
Nice to meet you
Do not worry,  am not do not want to kill you,  want you to live a long happy life and have many dancing grandchildren to admire
Picard screeches around a corner, then another one
He's lost the Fiat, for the moment
83
- Picard's car stops at the curb
Picard and Barris emerge
Picard opens the trunk
He lifts out a big folded-up clump of rubber with a an engine mounted on it
What the hell is that
Your ride, Monsieur Barris
Picard unfolds the rubber mass
He pulls a cord and it begins to inflate
It is an airplane, a one person inflatable plane
No fucking way
It's quite reliable and easy to operate
It will get you over the wall
Or you can stay here
In the German Democratic Republic
will arrange for you to get a good factory job
No, you must fly, like Daedalus before you, to the freedom of the west
Christ
What about you
They do not catch me, monsieur
This is my talent, to get away always
In guerre
In amour
This is my talent, and perhaps this is my curse
- The fully-inflated rubber plane flies down the street, dipping and rising erratically
The noise is deafening
Barris lies on his stomach and steers, looking petrified
He approaches the wall and manages to get the plane over it
The plane is shot by a soldier
Air hisses out
- Barris sits on a park bench
Jim Byrd approaches, sits
(chuckling) So, did you have a nice flight
() 84
: Fuck you, Jim
It was terrifying
Seems the  knew exactly what you were up to
You were there to kill Colbert, they were there to kill you
'm thinking we got a mole
So much hate in the world, Chuck
Am  in danger still
Jesus, yes
didn't go out of business since yesterday, so far as know
You're fucked, Chuck
But our main concern should be: if they know who you are, they know who  am
Fuck off
What do we do
Bow out
Lay low
That's what 'm gonna do
You're lucky you have another career to immerse yourself in
- Barris sits with a several network executive and some other staff members watching a fat man tap dance badly and, because of his weight, extremely loudly
It's painful for everybody to watch
The fat man finishes
Thank you
Thanks
That was great
The fat smiles and exits
Barris puts his head in his hands
don't know, Chuck
It's looking bleak
There's gotta be somebody in America with some talent
Ted Mack got bookings every week
The executives look at each other
(') Bring in the next thing
() 85
: An assistant opens the door and a middle-aged woman in pale blue polyester pants and Joan Crawford painted on eyebrows enters with a guitar
She begins to sing a folk song, very sincerely, in a very off-key monotone
It's unbearable and depressing
Barris glances over at the executive; she's checking her watch again
The song is endless
Barris's eyes grow cloudy
: - This is the same field where Renda was shot
Now, the folksinging woman is in the field singing
Barris pulls out a gun and aims it at the woman
Her eyes widen in terror, but she keeps singing
church bell chimes and Barris shoots her
She flies back, spurting blood
Her guitar hits the ground with a twang
- Barris snaps out of his fantasy with renewed energy      The folksinger is still droning on
(ushering out) Thank you
Thank you
We'll be in touch
That was wonderful
Barris closes the door behind the folksinger and turns to the executives
(') We've been going about this all wrong
Rather than killing ourselves trying to find good acts, we just book bad ones and kill them
#2 Chuck, it's torture to sit through even one of these people -- We kill 'em before they're through
As soon as it gets unbearable, we kill 'em
Dead
For God's sake, what are you talking about
() 86
: Celebrity judges ring a bell to end the act
to kill 'em
And when you kill something, it stops
This  know to be true
- Barris and some suits watch from the booth as an octogenarian woman on stage sings "Born Free" in an impossibly high voice
Jamie Farr gongs the woman
The woman is angry
vacuous host with great hair appears next to the woman
He seems genuinely agitated
Why'd you do that, Jamie
This is someone's grandmother
She was really trying
This is The Gong Show, not the Van Cliburn eliminations
This is a human being with aspirations
(muttering) Oh, fuck me
This guy sucks
He's bringing everyone down
The executives eye each other
None of the hosts are getting it, Chuck
But we have a thought
What
You host
All the executives smile at Barris
(') You get it
And we believe your awkward, non-professional, mumbling persona is exactly right for the show
don't want to be on tv
() 87
: Listen, we can't sit through anymore of these test shows
Do it, Chuck, or we advise the network to pull it
- Barris switches on the lights, walks through the empty bullpen area to his office, unlocks the door, enters
'  - Barris enters, stares out the window, looks at himself in a full-length mirror
(stiff) Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to The Gong Show
'm your host, Chuck Barris
(turns away in disgust) Ucchhh
Barris sits behind his desk, draws a line down a piece of paper and writes "Pros" and "Cons" at the top of the page
He thinks
Under "Pros" he writes "Become National Celebrity", "Get More Attention from Stewardesses", "Even more women will want to have sex with me"
Under "Cons" he writes: "Easier target for
" He gets up, paces
Suddenly, a shot rings out
It comes through the window and shatters the mirror
Barris dives to the floor
More shots, crazy relentless shooting
Barris crawls on his belly to the window, carefully reaches up and lowers the venetian blinds just as another shot whizzes through
The blinds explode
The shooting stops He waits on the floor, shaking like a leaf
He pulls the list off his desk and writes under "Pro": " need another hit before  die
" - Center-stage is empty
The band begins to play
The studio audience cheers
(
) And now, here's the host and star of our show, Chuck Barris
The curtain rises
Barris appears in a tuxedo coat, denim work shirt, cowboy boots and a hat pulled down over his eyes
Welcome to The Gong Show
Here's an esoteric act if there ever was one
Ephemeral
It's an ephemeral act
() () 88
: (') One that should get us our Emmy
Do we have an Emmy
We don't
Well this should get us one
Anyway, ladies and gentlemen
Big Nose
Big Nose leaps onto stage
He is skinny, wearing a flowered shirt and a sarong, and playing a toy flute while dancing in ladies platform shoes
Suddenly he drops his flute, rips off his sarong, revealing polka-dotted boxer shorts and a yellow leotard
He rushes to a steamer trunk, opens it, and begins crazily pulling out endless amounts of old newspapers
Barris watches from the wings, mesmerized
Big Nose is gonged
Barris dances out onto stage to join him
Why
Why
Why
don't know
don't understand
Barris glances out into the audience
Something glints
Is it a gun
He starts to sweat
Jaye
Morgan is saying something about Big Nose
But we can't understand it
The audience laughs
Barris continues to scan the audience
Someone in headphones signals Barris from behind a camera
(') (to Big Nose) Well, win a few, lose a few
(to audience) We'll be back with more stuff
right after this message
Barris waits on his mark for the taping to again begin
He watches the commotion around him with eagle eyes: technicians and stagehands running around, the audience chanting "Chuckie Baby", the celebrity panel joking with each other, the guys in the booth smoking, the guys in the band laughing
Barris turns around and around on his mark, trying to catch every movement, looking for a gun, a suspicious character
The chanting continues, louder and more distorted
The faces in the audience turn grotesque
Barris sweats profusely, his breathing becomes more and more shallow
Suddenly his eyes roll back in his head and he drops to the stage floor, unconscious

- We see Barris in bed, hooked up to machines The executive woman sits by his bed showing him the headlines
You can't quit
can't quit
But  get panicky, Louise, in front of all those people
You lack confidence, that's all
lack confidence
But we'll take care of that
We'll get you some confidence powder
Leave that to us
Confidence powder
Nose candy, Chuck

Blow, snow, flake

() 90
: The curtain rises
young man with a square of Plexiglass in his hands, presses his lips against the Plexiglass and blows
It makes a farting noise and allows to the audience to see inside his mouth
- Barris snorts some cocaine
We hear the act and audience "booing" and yelling "Gong him
" in the background
- The actual Jaye
Morgan is being interviewed
Chuck was real different on stage and off
Very tense
He was always looking over his shoulder
Even when we were fucking
Sort of an enigma
- Barris dances onstage with Gene Gene the Dancing Machine
- The actual Gene Gene is being interviewed
Oh yeah, a real Jekyll and Hyde
Sometimes nice as you please
Give you the shirt off his back
Other times he'd rant like a crazy man
remember once he screamed at me that  didn't know anything about dancing
"Nijinsky," he yelled, "now there was a dancer
" - black guy with weird teeth and a speech impediment attempts stand-up
He looks petrified
Today  had a bad day today
The audience yells "How bad was it
"   This throws the performer
Finally he continues
(') It was so bad, my wife didn't even know how to cook
() () 91
: (') That barracuda took an egg, put it in a pot of water, and burned the water
We had to rush that to the hospital
The audience boos
(') My mother-in-law
The booing continues
The comedian can't take it
He looks disoriented
He turns away from the audience and puts his head in his hands
Jamie Farr gongs him
- The actual Jamie Farr sits next to the pool
In the background we see a couple of kids with enormous noses splashing around in the water
Chuck used to love to discuss philosophy
think he was very saddened that the public saw him as this sort of spastic moron
remember at the time  was reading Wittgenstein
And Chuck was just thrilled to have someone else in addition to Rex Reed to talk about that stuff with
'  - Barris lies in bed next to Patricia
It's 12:30
He's chatting on the phone, lazily twirling the cord
Patricia reads
Look, Jamie, you know as well as  that language does not exist without an outward criteria
( ) Certainly
Wittgenstein said as much in Investigations
But if you read Ryle carefully -- (looking at clock) Chuck
Can we pick up tomorrow
() 92
: Yeah
But consider my thinking on elementary propositions
'm serious
Will do
Love ya
Right back at ya, amigo
Barris hangs up
Patricia kisses him
She pulls away
'm concerned about you
think you need to get back into the life
Our sex was always amazing after you killed
Truth is you're not that great after your discussions with Jamie Farr
The phone rings
(') Oh, c'mon
(picks up) Jamie,  can't talk anymore tonight -- (
) (telephone voice) This is Siegfried Keeler
need to see you
Barris jerks up, surprised, alarmed
Patricia watches him
(
) Assassins do not fraternize
That Keeler was calling me could mean it was my turn to get hit
(
) (phone voice) am in town on business, Chuck
And desire nothing more than your company for dinner
consider you one of my closest friends
Sure
Dinner sounds good
There's a place called La Scala
See you there at eight
Barris hangs up
() 93
: (2) (eyes closed) Dinner sounds good with whom
Keeler
Patricia glances over at Barris
They stare at each other
- Barris pulls into the parking lot
As he waits for the valet parking attendant to get to him, he adjusts the gun strapped to his ankle
- Barris enters the crowded restaurant, looks around, spots Keeler sitting at a table in the rear
As he makes his way back, Barris shakes hands and says hello to several early seventies tv celebrities scattered throughout the restaurant: Carrol 'Connor, Joanne Worley, Flip Wilson, Ron Palillo
Barris arrives at Keeler's table
Keeler rises and embraces Chuck
He's already drunk
They sit
very fancy place
Only the best for my friend
The friendships one develops during wartime are remarkably strong
Yes
There is an awkward silence
So how is the business of television
Barris, pleased to have something to talk about, rambles
Well, it's hit and miss
've got a new show called "Operation Entertainment" which  believe is going to kill
It's sort of a Bob Hope visiting the troops thing, but it's weekly and
Keeler is staring right through Barris
() 94
: Why do you do what you do, Chuck
Well,  like to think that  bring joy and laughter to millions of people
'm not saying that my shows are as good as they could be
Yet
But -- Why do you kill
Barris looks around, clears his throat
Oh
During the second world war,  had the pleasure of killing
Yes, pleasure found it exhilirating
Afterwards, could find nothing else to fill me so much with life
So  became what  am today
wanted the exhiliration again
of death
The waiter appears
Are you gentlemen ready to order
'll have the shrimp scampi and a green salad
And for you, sir
Um, Just give me a steak
Rare
Thank you
The waiter leaves
Keeler sips his drink, stares at Barris
"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy whole might
Work while it is called, for the night cometh wherein no man can work
" () 95
: (2) That's Carlyle
Yes
It's amazing you should quote him
He's my hero
read in a book recently that killing your first man is like making love to your first woman
Every smell, every nuance, you remember with a special allure, as if the acts had occured outside civilization, outside time
And when the allure is gone, you are condemned
Condemned
am condemned to live the rest of my life outside civilization
You will be too, my good friend
Barris looks into Keeler's hollow eyes
- The actual Barris puffs on his cigar
The next day  heard Keeler offed himself
- Keeler falls silently in slow motion from a very high window
(
) You never really know in the world of espionage if something labeled a suicide actually is a suicide
But he was dead
That  knew
' - Barris eats dinner with Penny
Barris seems depressed
Penny is reserved
() 96
: When you called,  wasn't gonna come
'm glad you did, Pen
said to myself, enough
Enough of this jerk already
Enough
could see how you would feel that way
But 've come upon something interesting through my delvings into human psychology
It's called , Transactual Analysis
Transactional Analysis
Now see, by correcting me you're responding as "Parent" to my "Child
" (authoritative voice) "Here's the proper way to say this word, Penny
" But that's okay
As long as we both understand that's what you're doing
'know, 'm okay, you're okay
So what's wrong, Chuck
Are you okay
guy  knew killed himself last night
My God
Everyone you know kills themselves
Or tries
Who is it this time
You don't know him
stagehand
Why'd he do it
He didn't like his work anymore
Is being a stagehand really bad or something
() 97
: (2) (beat) Yeah, it's pretty bad
Patricia storms up to the table
You were supposed to meet me at The Palm two hours ago
Oh fuck,  forgot
Who is this
do not get stood up
Do you understand
Um, Penny, this is Patricia
(to Patricia) How did you find me
Are you serious
That's what  do for a living
Who's Patricia
What does she mean, that's what she does for a living
You're dead in my book, Strawberry-dick
Strawberry dick
What's that
There is no second chance
Get it
(to Penny) Nice meeting you, Penny
've heard a lot about you
(to Barris, walking away) Oh, by the by, Byrd's dead
Patricia exits
Penny just looks down at the table
And
and okay
'm only gonna give you one more chance, man
That's it
Get it

'   - Barris snorts some coke, pulls out of the studio parking lot
The sound of his heart beating pounds in his ears
Another car pulls behind him
wired Barris notices the car in his rearview mirror
He turns
The other car turns also
Barris speeds up
So does the other car
Barris panics; he tries to lose the other car
chase ensues
Finally Barris screeches to a halt, pulls a gun from his glove compartment
The second car screeches to a halt behind him
Barris already out of his car and at the driver's side window of the second car
He looks in and sees there are two petrified teenagers, a boy and a girl, holding up their hands
Barris pulls open the door
(screaming) Who sent you
Who the fuck sent you
Nobody, man
We just waited for you to leave after the show
We just think the show is cool
We just think you're cool
The girl is crying
Please don't kill us
Barris points the gun at them for a long while, his hands shaking wildly
- Barris stands backstage waiting for his cue
The Unknown Comic appears next to him, wearing a paper bag with two eyeholes cut out over his head
Barris glances over at him
Hey, Chuck
Barris doesn't say anything
He studies the bag
Barris pulls a pistol from an ankle holster, and jams it against the bag
Take it off
Huh
The fucking bag
Take it off
() 99
: The Unknown Comic takes the bag off
He looks terrified
Barris stares him down
(
) Ladies and Gentlemen, Chuck Barris
Barris dances onto the stage
- Barris is clapping his hands together
He looks happy and relaxed
The audience is cheering
Here he is, the Prince of Puns, the Wizard of Whoopee
The Unknown Comic
The Unknown Comic appears upstage with bag on head
Chuckie Baby, Chuckie Baby, Chuckie Baby
What
What do you want
What's the difference between toilet paper and a shower curtain
don't know
(calling off) Here's the guy
The audience laughs
Barris feigns annoyance and pushes the unknown comic off the stage
Get out of here
(for Barris's ears only) You're fucking crazy, man
'  - Barris sits behind his desk, drinking and popping pills
Loretta pokes her head in

: Phone call from someone named Tuvia
Who
Tuvia
'll take it
Don't hang up
Barris picks up the phone
(') Hello
(
) Hello, is this Chuck Barris
Yes
(
) Oh, this is Tuvia Feldman
don't know if you remember me -- Of course  do
(
) 'm in town and 've been following your career and  wondered if you might want to get a drink
For old times sake
- Tuvia plays with the dog
White panties are revealed
(
) Sweet Tuvia
- Adult Tuvia answers the door with her baby
(
) Ripe Tuvia
- Barris waits in a booth, anxiously eyeing the door
guy approaches
() 101
: Hey, Chuck,  got a talent
Not now
Just take a second
The guy gets down on all fours and starts barking and panting like a dog
It is a repulsive and frightening sight, but Barris becomes transfixed by it and cannot take his eyes off the guy
(
) Chuck
Barris tears his eyes away from the dog guy to look at Tuvia
She is an older middle-aged lady
Younger than Chuck, but clearly of no interest to him
The disappointment on his face is palpable
(') It's Tuvia
Remember
Hi
(
) Old Tuvia
(') Hi
You look great
: - Barris sits in a booth across from Tuvia
The relationship has shifted once again
Now middle-aged Tuvia is trying to flirt
As they talk, she touches his arm repeatedly
She laughs at everything he says
She reapplies lipstick as they talk
There's a quiet desperation in her eyes
Barris is pleasant but unengaged
(
) Ah, Tuvia
The fantasy of Tuvia forever cast out by the reality of Tuvia
Finally, because of my fame and her desperate straits, her poverty and single parenthood, she was going to submit to me
Finally  could've had her
() () 102
: (
) (') could've had what had so long eluded me
But now she was old and  wasn't interested
- Middle-aged Tuvia staring out at the night-time landscape in the darkened train car, her suitcase on the seat next to her
'  - Barris is having sex with two twenty year old nymphettes     The drugs and alcohol flow freely
He seems to be enjoying himself but there is a hollowness in his eyes
(
) Tuvia was old, but not me
was the Game Show King
- The rabid audience members chant, "Chuckie Baby, Chuckie Baby, Chuckie Baby
" '  - Barris snorts Coke in the darkness
He scans an article headlined: "Chuck Barris is the Decline of Western Civilization
" The phone rings, alarmingly breaking the stillness
What
Paul Picard is dead
- Barris looks down from the plane as Picard, on the ground, runs after it
(yelling) Fly, Daedalus, fly
'  - Barris hangs up the phone
He stares off into the distance
The phone rings again, again shattering the silence
- Barris on stage with red stocking hat
() 103
: This is the moment we've been waiting for
The contestants appear on stage
(') The winner is Miss Tiny Brooks
model appears with a trophy and a big check and hands it to an enormously fat woman
The other contestants appluad
two midgets dance
The band plays
massive amount of confetti and balloons fall on everyone
- It's the Emmy Awards
Barris is in the audience, next to his starlet date
He sweats through his tuxedo, fidgets
Ed Asner and Caroll 'Connor are on stage presenting
And the winner is Taxi
The Taxi theme starts as the winners make their way to the stage
(') James
Brooks, Stan Daniels, and Ed
Weinberger, executive producers
The starlet whispers into Barris's ear, outraged at the unfairness
don't see why your shows are never nominated
Barris looks sick
Jim Brooks is on stage accepting
And  honor you, members of the academy, for recognizing and supporting high quality television
- Barris is locked in a stall, vomiting
The door to the bathroom opens
Someone enters
Barris peeks through the closed stall door
It's Jim Brooks, whistling and holding his Emmy
He places it next to the sink, unzips his fly and pisses
An agitated Barris pulls his gun from his ankle holster, opens the stall door a crack, and shakily aims the gun at Brooks' back
104
- But as  stood there,  realized, couldn't kill Jim Brooks, the man who was responsible for such good stuff: Mary Tyler Moore, Rhoda, Cindy, Phyllis, episodes of My Friend Tony
loved those shows as much as anybody in America
- Barris is crying
He turns the gun away from Brooks, almost against his will, and sticks it in his own mouth
After a moment, he realizes he can't do that either
(
) couldn't kill either of us, so  let us both live
Jim Brooks and me
The rest is history
Barris puts the gun away, flushes the toilet and exits the stall
Hey, congratulations, Jim
Brooks turns and looks at Barris
He smiles
Oh, hey
Thanks
Chuck Barris
The Gong Show
Oh, right
Hey, thanks, Chuck
Once again you deserve it
Your shows are the greatest
You bring so much
quality to the medium
Thank you
appreciate that
really do They smile and nod at each other awkwardly
Chuck waits for some sort of return of the compliment
It does not come
They continue to nod at each other
105
- The actual Jim Brooks is being interviewed
don't really remember ever meeting Chuck Barris
(
) In the men's room at the Emmys, he says
Brooks thinks, looks at interviewer
'm not saying it didn't happen
'm just, y'know
If he remembers it, 'm sure it happened
Really doesn't seem like much of an anecdote though
- big party is in progress
The place is packed
Late seventies celebrities abound
Alan Alda is there
Burt Reynolds, Jamie Farr, Jaye
Morgan, Gene Gene the Dancing Machine, Pam Dawber, Farrah Fawcett Majors and Lee Majors, John Belushi
Chuck Barris steps out of the bathroom, drink in hand
He wipes his nose like someone who's just snorted coke
He wanders disconsolately and slightly wild-eyed through the crowd
He sits in a chair
man sitting across from him looks at Barris
His eyes light up
#1 Hey, you're Chuck Barris
Yeah
#1 love your show
(unenthused) Great
'm just heading -- #1 have a talent  think you'd really appreciate
Uh-huh
Party Man #1 begins farting "Jingle Bells
"   Barris   gets up and moves away
() 106
: #1 (calling after) Hey, didn't you ever hear of Le Petomane
He was a star, buddy
These are totally smell-free
Barris settles by the fireplace
pretty woman approaches, smiling
Hi
Hi
thought it was you
(bowing) It's me
'm glad to meet you because  wanted to tell you that 've seen The Gong Show and think you are the most insidious and despicable force in entertainment today
Well -- How dare you subject the rest of the world to your loathsome view of humanity
don't think it's that loathsome
What is it then
To mock some poor, lonely people who just crave a little attention in their lives
To destroy them
So everybody's not brilliantly talented
They're still people
They deserve respect and compassion
mean, who the hell are you
What the fuck have you ever done that elevates you above the pathetic masses
Oh,  forgot, you created The Dating Game
Wow, right up there with the Sistine Chapel
guess that's what gives you the right to
() 107
: (2) Excuse me, 've got to -- Barris loses himself in the crowd
He hurries past a guy who recognizes and starts chanting
#2 Chuckie Baby
Chuckie Baby
Chuckie Baby
Barris turns and makes his way through the crowd to the door
- Barris makes his way down the crowded street
People stare, turn their heads to gawk
We hear over and over again: "Hey, isn't that Chuck Barris
" and "Hey, look, The Gong Show guy
", and "Chuckie baby, Chuckie baby
" Barris smiles wanly and nods
People shove paper and pen in his face and he scribbles autographs without stopping
Sweat forms on his brow
His polyester shirt is drenched
(
) She was right
What the hell had  done with my life
Among the fans on the street, Barris spots the fat bachelor he killed in London
He sports a bullet hole in his head Barris does a double take
(') Wait, you're that guy
You're dead
This is screwy
only want to be loved
That's all  fucking wanted
Barris hurries away from the fat bachelor
He begins to spot others converging on him: the corpses of those he killed, bloody and disfigured
Crazy, angry-looking gonged Gong Show contestants appear in the crowd with weapons
agents in trench coats and sunglasses wield guns, Day of the Dead skeletons dance after him
Barris breaks into a run
Suddenly confetti and balloons pour down on him out of the night sky
Barris dashes across the street, almost getting hit by a car
He ducks down an alley to catch his breath
As he leans against the wall and heaves, a middle- aged woman appears, somewhat backlit by the street light
() 108
: - Mr
Barris
No, 'm
- My name is Louise Wechsler and 'm here from Tulsa with my family and
Please, 'm not feeling well
- Just a moment of your time
love your show
And, well, , sort of, have a talent myself
You can stop by the office to audition tomorrow
The woman continues to approach
- Well, 'm leaving tomorrow and  was just wondering
See,  dance a little and was just wondering -- There's no way out of this
Barris sighs
Yeah, all right
Go ahead
Barris turns to face the woman, who's very close now
She starts to dance around, sort of ballet-like, very badly
Barris watches
She pirouettes, arms above her head
(') Very nice
Something in her hand glints in the light
Barris reflexively grabs her arm
It's an ice pick
The two wrestle for it
The woman is extremely strong
Barris jams the palm of his hand up into the woman's nose
She staggers back, but doesn't drop the ice pick
Barris leaps at her
The two roll on the ground
The woman pins Barris
She straddles him and is about to stab him through the air
Barris reaches under her skirt and grabs her crotch
The middle-aged woman is a man
He screams in a distinctly male voice
Barris takes the moment of distraction to grab the ice pick and jam it up through the assailant's chin and into his brain
The assailant slumps over
() 109
: (2) Barris pushes the body off himself, kneels beside it, and pulls off the wig
He gets up, shaking and heaving
He looks at the body one more time, kicks it in the head with all his might
- That was it
just disappeared
The network had to put The Gong Show into reruns
It was 1981
holed myself up in this hotel in New York
Parker Hotel
- :   ,  1982 We see Barris from above, shivering and naked in the corner
The manuscript pages are piled high next to the typewriter
Barris looks up at the camera with outstretched arms, appealing to the gods
Who Am
There is a pounding on the wall from a neighbor
(
) Who cares
Shut the fuck up
There's a knock at the door
Barris crawls toward it, peeks through the peephole
Fuck
Shit
Piss
Barris unlocks the door
Simon Oliver stands there
Barris
How'd you know where  was
Chuck, Chuck, Chuck, don't be an orangutan
We always know where you are
We always know what you're doing
By the by, 'd think twice before 'd attempt to get that tripe you're writing published
And there's a typo on page -- () 110
: Look, what do you want, Oliver
don't work for you anymore
have things to
Barris trails off
'd like you to come back for one last assignment, Chuck
No
Now get
Good-bye think you might be interested when tell you it's the mole who fingered your friends Jim Byrd and Paul Picard
and Seigfried Keeler
Keeler committed suicide
Yes, of course he did
He threw himself from a twentieth floor window after he strangled himself to death with an electrical cord
(beat) 'm not interested, Oliver
As long as the mole's alive, you don't have a chance in hell of remaining so
Besides, killing is in your blood, old man
You fit the profile
Barris lunges at Oliver, pushes him against the wall
That fucking profile again
What's the fuck is it
What the fuck do you bastards know about me, that  don't
Indeed
Where to begin
First, let go of me
Barris lets go
Oliver sits in a chair, straightens his shirt
() 111
: (2) (') Let's see
Well, you had a twin sister, stillborn, strangled by your umbilical cord
Your first hit, Chuck
Your mother always wanted a daughter
She blamed you for your sister's death
And, so, until your sister Phoebe was born, she raised you as a girl
That's not true
Oh, and your father the dentist
Not really your father
Your biological father was a man named Edmund James Windsor
serial killer
fact your mother didn't know when she had an affair with him in 1930
If you want to look him up, he was also known as the Tarrytown Troll, because he had been described by witnesses as short and ugly
Windsor died in the electrical chair at Ossining in 1939
We believed your self- loathing tendencies coupled with that extra  chromosome and whatever else you inherited from your father would serve us well
You're lying
'm trying to think what more  can tell you
'm sure there's more
But you have me at a disadvantage here, Barris don't have your files in front of me
Just leave me the hell alone
Your mother always loved the game shows, and you so wanted to please her
We never expected the game show business to work out for you
But that it did, turned out to be in our favor
guess your need to be a good daughter drove you more than we anticipated
() 112
: (3) Barris lunges at Oliver
The two wrestle on the floor
Barris punches him repeatedly in the face
: - Barris lies sleeping in a tangle of sheets
There's blood on his hands
knock at the door
Barris jumps awake, grabs his gun
He looks around
The room is a mess, stuff knocked over
There's been a fight
He sees his bloody hands
Another knock
Huh
What
(
) Chuck
It's Pen
Barris brings his gun with him to the door, looks through the peephole, then opens the door
Penny stands there, takes in the room, the mess, the haggard Barris
(') Oh, Chuck
Jesus, how'd you find me
Am  listed in some guidebook or something
You sent me your last letter on hotel stationary
Oh
Well, it's great to see you, Pen
You look beautiful
Barris hugs her
don't really
But  appreciate the lie
know how you hate lying
(looking around) Boy, this place is scary looking
Yeah
(taps his head) The human psyche
() 113
: came to take you back to California with me
It's a lonely state without you
don't know, Redhead
can't wait forever for you to ask me to marry you, you know
Well, apparently can
But  really don't want to
Chuck
Pen
(crying) love you so much
You don't understand
don't even know why
You're such a schmuck
You don't know the half of it
You're not gonna marry me, are you
don't know if  can
Penny nods her head and leaves
Barris watches her go, then falls to the floor and weeps
- ,  - , Barris, dressed in a suit, sits with Patricia Watson
He smiles across the table at her
can't believe you finally left your two- hundred-dollar-a-night cave to see me
'm honored
'know,  got a visit this morning from Penny
She's wanted to marry me forever
But she doesn't know who  am, what 've, what 'm capable of
() () 114
: (') And she can't ever know
So what does she really love
lie
And  started thinking, Treesh, you are the only woman in the world who truly knows me
know 've screwed you over in the past, and 'm really sorry
just want you to know that you're the one  want to be with
love you, Treesh
Patricia looks at him
Her hard-as-nails demeanor softens
She smiles
Barris smiles and reaches across the table for her hand
- Barris and Patricia stand looking out at the harbor
hate myself for how 've lived, Treesh
Neitzsche said, "Whoever despises oneself still respects oneself as one who despises
" never thought of that
Jesus,  can't even despise myself with any insight
Insane asylums are filled with people who think they're Jesus or Satan
Very few have delusions of being the guy down the block who works at an insurance company
Wonder what that means
'know,  wanted to be a writer once wanted to write something that someday some lesser person would quote
But never did
'm the lesser person, Treesh
never said anything meaningful that wasn't said by somebody else first
am disposable
disposed of people and  am disposable
(beat) You look cold
Barris drapes his jacket over Patricia's shoulders
Chuck, what's gotten into you
You're actually acting like a gentleman
() 115
: Barris kisses her
She lets him
(') Well, it's late
should get going
suppose you still won't tell me where you're staying
No
But 'll show you
She takes his hand
They walk off
'   - Patricia enters followed by Barris
She turns on the light
Drink
Sure
Bourbon
Patricia pours some drinks
There are a couple of chairs near the window
Barris sits in one
've been thinking a lot about you lately, Chuck
Yeah
Patricia approaches Barris with the drinks, hands him one
've missed you
