:          - " " - It's finally happened
Hell's frozen over
Christmas is two weeks off, arid  is falling in Gotham
Beneath its pristine white blanket, the city looks uncharacteristically serene -- almost inviting Peace has been miraculously restored: strangers wave hello
Salvation Army Santas ring their bells on streetcorners
And now, as night falls, an   winks on above Broad Avenue: "   -- Only 16 Shopping Days Left Till Christmas
" The streets are bustling with jolly shoppers
At a souvenir store, we find an exasperated  squabbling with her seven- year old
Like many other storefronts in Gotham, this one is overflowing with bootleg  : t-shirts, key chains, ceramic figurines
The kid is already wearing a Batman baseball cap and a little black cape, but he obviously wants more
Mom drags him off past another store window, this one full of , with a sign reading " -- $19

Beneath his array jacket is a grubby sweatshirt with the familiar yellow-and-black logo
In Gotham this winter, Batmania is everywhere
- Two hours later, the 's grown into a full-fledged blizzard
The drifts are two feet deep and the streets are all but empty of cars
massive   the size of a Panzer tank rumbles past,
and revealing, as it passes, a group of , all bundled up in mufflers and parkas
Unbothered by the weather, they walk the street singing, spreading cheer and goodwill to the few passersby
They've just gone into a lovely a capella rendition of "Silent Night" when an oversized  , outfitted with snow chains, clanks slowly past in the wake of the plow
Its sides are decorated with cartoon igloos advertising a popular ice cream snack --   -- oddly inappropriate for this time of year
streetcorner , with bell and bucket,  at the truck as it rounds a corner
The  carol
Then -- -- a   rocks the street -- followed by the sound of   and a high, wailing
-   - Around the corner there's  on the streets
The windows have blown out of Gotham's leading jewelry store
Gut-shot stagger and go face down in the snow as , dressed in white camouflage gear, clamber out through the shattered glass with
spill around the corner to see what's going on, but a spray of  sends them scattering in panic
The truck pulls even with the jewelry store, and as it does
The   open
slides down from the back of the truck
The  scramble aboard, and mere seconds later out  -- riding atop five
appears, taking the corner just a trifle too fast --  on the icy street and plowing into a drift
-   - The  gun the engine, but their wheels are spinning in the snow -- no traction
They're about to climb out and give chase on foot when, through the windshield, they see the Salvation Army

The windshield disintegrates and the  sink from view as races off to the last of the snowmobiles, which is already burdened with
-   - converge on the jewelry store -- but it's difficult to carry on a high-speed pursuit when the snow's a foot deep and the best you can do is 6
The   skid to a halt, blocked by the rumbling
By now, of course, the  are gone -- scooting off on either side of the plow, sticking to the snowy sidewalks
-    - glide across the sidewalks, sending the few hardy souls who are out on the streets
couple of  are cowering behind a fire hydrant, trying to avoid getting run over
Every time they poke their heads out, another  whizzes past, missing them by inches
The  fan out in various directions
These guys are obviously going to get away clean -- unless The  points up at the night sky, where a  is blazing in the darkness --
-   - takes a radio call as he streaks down the long wide avenue which borders Gotham Park -- one of the few streets which is relatively clear
The  at the wheel goes wide-eyed and nudges his partner in disbelief
Before their eyes,   appear from the cross streets up ahead and  at the entrance to Gotham Park
Bringing up the rear is
What the hell --
-   - Several squad cars are now massed at the entrance to the park -- but there's one problem
The city's snow plows don't operate on the park roads -- and the entrance is blocked off with  reading "
" huge steep drift prevents them from entering -- and so all they can do is stand by helplessly,  as the snowmobiles vanish into the trees
The  race about like headless chickens, trying to concoct a plan
couple of them are trying to scale the stone walls of the park
Another is at his car, barking into a radio mike: Yeah, you heard me
Snowmobiles
(pause) So what do we do
Chase 'em on foot
at the blare of a horn
The  peer down the long corridor of the cross street -- and see a barreling toward them at 90 , with no intention of stopping
dive left and right
split-second later
a -  of -  erupts from the front of the jet-black supercar -- instantaneously the drift that blocks the entrance to the park -- turning the ice and snow on the paths before it into water
The  screams past in the wink of an eye
The get to their feet; cold as it is, they're sweating One of them mops his brow and announces, dumfounded: That was Batman yanks   into the nearest squad car, and the others follow suit
As long as the 's cleared a path, they might as well join in the chase
- -- both dressed in   and with    visible underneath -- are trudging along the path when they're  by a pair of speeding
Moments later, they spot a   on the horizon
and their   as the  roars into view, Thrilled beyond words, they , slapping high-fives as the car streaks past
-   - His face is weirdly illuminated by the flame still spitting from the front of the car
Cool as ever -- approaching the chase as a simple problem in logic -- he checks a radar display on his dashboard and sees
-    -   - The cops follow along in 's path
The lead car and plows headlong into a drift
The  jams the pedal, but his rear wheels end up digging a deep rut in the ice
He sits there cursing, pumping the accelerator as other race past him on foot
- The various  have spread out, their vehicles over the hilly terrain of the park
He spots two of them up ahead; as he draws closer, they  , veering off to the left and right
- on the front fenders, and   rotate into place
The Batmobile fires a pair of - , which  into the snow on either side and disappear
- The  looks back over his shoulder and sees what appears to be a    plowing through the snow behind him, He takes evasive action, but the always seems to follow
Just as he approaches the crest of a hill
the  slams into the rear of the
The force of impact knocks the  cleanly off
His  lands in the snow beside him, but the  keeps going -- sailing over the crest of the hill and striking the rocks beyond with a deafening
- This 's a little smarter than his buddy
When he sees the shark fin on his tail, he noses his snowmobile off into a The trees are too closely spaced for the torpedo to maneuver; it strikes the nearest tree trunk and explodes harmlessly
The  is feeling good about himself, because the Batmobile can't follow either
But  has a Plan
As he drives alongside the grove, he   , passing the snowmobile on its left
attached to a cable launches from the side of the Batmobile and into a distant
The cable goes taut, and the tree  -- directly into the path of the second
The vehicle crashes into the trunk, and the hapless  goes cartwheeling head-over- heels into a drift
In the distance,  appear -- racing to the scene on foot, ready for mop-up duty
kills the flamethrower, hits the brakes, and , doing a quick 180 on the snow
He's just spotted fresh quarry: snowmobiles three and four, whizzing over a rolling white pasture in the distance
- We're at a makeshift  -- where a cluster of are burning refuse in a garbage can to keep warm
They look on in puzzlement as the two  whiz past and disappear over a crest of a hill
-   #3  #4 They bounce down the hillside and  -- arriving at the edge of a frozen-over
With the roar of the Batmobile behind them, the two  get the same idea simultaneously
Smiling, they rev their engines and set out over the surface of the lake
Now the Batmobile crests the ridge
The car's weight tips suddenly and it begins to skid down the hill toward the lake
sees what's happening and kills the flamethrower just in time -- but he can't brake the car on the snowy slope
The prow of the Batmobile slides out onto the edge of the lake -- -- and under its weight, the  begins to crack
The left front tire takes a sudden dip -- and worse yet, the car is sliding forward
- He shifts frantically from drive to reverse, trying to rock the car out of its predicament, but his rear wheels find no purchase
He can hear the ice cracking beneath him
Grimacing, he throws a switch on the dashboard -- - -- and the trunk pops open
An industrial-strength shoots upward and digs in at a point beyond the crest of the hill; and a concealed   begins to grind away, hauling the Batmobile uphill, out of danger
- Suspended just above the icy lake, he sees the vanishing into the distance
He opens (yet another) panel on the dashboard
-   #3  #4 The  give each other a big thumbs-up
They're almost halfway across the lake now and the Batmobile is disabled
All at once they hear a strange  overhead
Fireworks
No, it's a   -- rocketing past them, hitting the ice some forty feet ahead and
break free and  in the frigid water -- and the  are skidding into the drink before they know what's hit them
#5 - The last of the robbers is   -- his big sack filled not with toys, but precious stones
He approaches the edge of the park, negotiating his way through a maze of rocky outcroppings
He squirts out from behind a boulder into a clearing
and  in  as a     erupts behind him
The  speeds out from the other side of the boulder;  twists his accelerator, desperately trying to build up speed
As it is, he's barely managing to stay ahead of the flamethrower
But the jet of flame suddenly ; the  of the Batmobile rises half a foot -- -- and   launch into the air
heavy  is strung between them -- and it lands , entangling the snowmobile and stopping him in his tracks
Immobilized, he watches through the net in horror as the Batmobile barrels down
When the great black machine is almost atop him -- -- it stops on a dime six inches from his heavily-padded frame
-    - The  are spread out near the entrance
They've rounded up the other  and returned most of the loot
They hear a dull  in the distance
and a few seconds later the  streaks into view, dragging the  behind it -- , his loot, and his snowmobile, all tied up in one tidy parcel
At the entrance to the park, the  detaches itself from the Batmobile, dumping  into the hands of the waiting
Without stopping, the  roars out of the park and vanishes whence it came
mildly-humiliated  turns to his colleague and : Merry Christmas
The second  points to , still struggling in the net
Gift-wrapped and everything

After a high-speed chase -- over $750,000 in precious jewels were recovered intact by the police force -- working in concert with Batman
At the sound of Batman's name, a  goes up in the crowd: -- winces and lets out a sigh
The  are a group of pugnacious, well-muscled , late teens and early twenties, all dressed in identical garb: black Batman and little red Guardian-angel
They're obviously members of the same club -- just like the guys we saw in the park
waits for them to shut up, but they don't; so he grabs the mike and speaks slowly and distinctly, trying to be heard over the din
would like to stress -- that while this city enjoys a special relationship with Batman -- (louder) -- we do not condone vigilantism -- (practically screaming) --
It's no use
He's totally drowned out by the  , who continue to shout and shake their fists
Giving up, he returns the mike to a  and marches up the steps in a huff

Where does this -- (; expletive deleted) -- Gordon get off calling us We're not breakin' any laws
We're a group of concerned citizens, that's all -- just like Batman You people are nothing but hoodlums
Hey, lady -- we're out here on patrol riskin' our necks to protect old biddies like you
(into mike) If this lame-o Gordon could do his job -- from the crowd
The picture jumps suddenly as a minicam is jostled; some sort of  appears to be breaking out
Before it does,    from the screen, placing us in: -  - where    is watching the Sekowsky interview with extreme dismay
As he trims the crusts from a pair of hearty watercress sandwiches, he
makes a pained face -- it's all Sekowsky's fault
Onscreen, the fracas continues;  has recommandeered the mike

Behind him, his  begin to chant: "

He turns on the radio in search of something more soothing
"Good King Wenceslas" pipes through the manor; smiling, sets the sandwich plate alongside a steaming kettle on a Sterling silver tea service
'  -   - The    as , white linen draped over one forearm, sets the tea tray down on his master's big mahogany desk
He digs in his pocket for a key and unlocks a side drawer
The drawer contains a stack of yellowed, aging -- among them one which reads " : Prominent Doctor, Wife Slain in Robbery
Unidentified Gunman Leaves Child Unharmed
"   digs around beneath the clippings and finds a concealed  at the rear of the drawer
Gears grind, and a sectional bookcase detaches itself from the wall -- sliding out a couple of feet to reveal a which descends into darkness

"Good King Wenceslas" is on the speakers down here as well
Across a catwalk the  rests on its little plateau, wrapped in a tarp
clears some space on a lab table and sets the tea service down
He glances up at the bank of video monitors and sees , still babbling, on several channels simultaneously
He scans the cave, but there's no trace of Sir

As if in response,  screech and flutter in the distant recesses of the cavern

He's wearing his civvie -- tweed pants and cashmere sweater -- but he's got the utility belt, with its spring-action reel, buckled about his waist
Clutching a bundle, he hangs in midair for a moment, dangling over the void

, still dangling, glances up at the  interview and nods
Yeah
lot of crazy people in this world
rocks back and forth to build up momentum
He kicks off on the nearest stone outcropping, lands gracefully on the Batcave floor, and unbuckles his belt
Preoccupied, he drops his mysterious bundle on the lab table: a roll of black fabric, and a cluster of lightweight, hollow  , connected by what appears to be

The tubing inflates and the rods spring erect -- stiffening, wing-like, into something which looks remarkably like the skeleton of an umbrella
Most ingenious, sir

To the untrained eye, sir, it looks remarkably like

Sounds good

Good guess, Alfred
That's exactly right

He sits at his lab table;  unfolds a napkin on his lap, pours a cup of tea
Splendid, sir, and if  may say, 'm glad you're putting your time to such productive use

We can do better than that
Then there's the foster-parents program

He seems oddly preoccupied -- not exactly melancholy, but his thoughts are obviously a million miles away

Yeah

Always gets me thinking about

Why this sudden change of heart
Gentlemen,  want my debt to be repaid in full

The guilt, the fear, the constant shame

The  switches to a hockey game, because none of the rowdies at the bar give a shit about Walter Barrett
None, that is, except for a strapping young bruiser named , who gets up and makes his way to a pay phone in the corner
Moments later, the owner of the high heels enters; she opens her black fur coat and unwraps her muffler, revealing exotic, vaguely Eurasian features
She's dark and elegant, fine- boned, regal of bearing -- and her name, though we don't know it yet, is
She's not the kind of girl who typically frequents the Wharf Rat, and so her entrance creates quite a stir at the nearby pool table misses his shot and digs a rut in the felt
Two blowsy  size her up territorially as she finds an open stool at the bar and settles in with serene indifference

In mid-conversation he notices

You'd have to be crazy
Nobody'd wear the real thing to a dive like this
Oh, they're real, all right
So are these
She waves her  -- long, polished, and talon-sharp -- in front of his eyes
With lightning speed, before he can react, she pins his wrist to the bar -- and with one quick stroke carves a    in the back of his hand
's eyes flash as he gasps in shock
He tries to jerk his hand away, but he can't break her grip
Then -- her dominance firmly established -- she releases his hand with a coy, Cheshire-cat smile

He blinks, forces a chuckle, smiles unsteadily
She takes his wounded hand, lifts it slowly to her mouth, and   at the blood

Panicking, the  with the suitcase full of money turns tail and dives for the gangplank

The gangplank falls aside as the steamboat pulls away from the pier
She hoists an abandoned  ,  the with a round of automatic fire, and  off the boat -- landing in a graceful crouch on the edge of the pier
Most of the   have taken flight, but a few unlucky specimens remain behind
She somersaults forward; takes one goon off his feet with a crack of the whip; knocks another off the dock with a twirling high-kick to the jaw; sends two more reeling with swift talon-slashes
The whole frenzied mop-up action takes just under ten seconds
Alone at last, she stands back to survey the scene
Counting the stiff's on the boat -- which is now receding in the harbor -- there must be well over a dozen dead
The snow is speckled with red
half-dozen bodies lie sprawled in their own blood; one of them, the lone survivor, is face-down and softly

Instead, she's checking the   stamped on the sides of the crates
She finds crate #18396- and rummages among its contents until she comes up with a carefully-wrapped parcel
She opens it carefully and holds it up for inspection

Sitting on the edge of the bed, she peels off her , twisting them around into tight cords
With a coy smile she runs her finger in a circle around 's hairy chest -- and then, abruptly, knots one stocking tightly about his wrist and ties it off on the bedpost
Hey, what are you doing --
He tries to break her grip
She  him sharply across the face
You're very inquisitive
You'll just have to be disciplined An   spreads across his face as she binds his other hand to the bedpost
None too quick, he's just caught on that all this is part of 's kinky scene
She crosses quickly to the bathroom -- You know, 've

Here she pauses to dig in her knapsack
She pulls out a retractable  at the end of a rope, swings it around, at the rooftop across the street

Then, weary and exhilarated, she drops to her knees; bathed in moonlight, she preens, stretches, emits eerie little purrs and hisses of pleasure
She's just made a kill and her blood is running high, so she's stopped for a moment of Quality Time
She hears an odd crunching noise two roofs over
Her whole body tenses and -- though her head doesn't move -- her eyes dart left

If it's possible to see absolute consternation behind that mask, we're seeing it now

Instead, she goes to the ledge of the roof and begins to , like a gymnast on the balance beam --  for him in a little private show -- a strange, self-infatuated, for 's benefit

She hears a noise

Makes a big show of looking left and right
Somehow afraid she'll see him watching, jumps back into the shadows
She gathers her things; a small flutters from her knapsack to the snowy roof, and she  over the edge
Snapping back to reality, he bolts across the roof just in time to see -- -   -   - She's rapidly working her way down the side of the building, flipping down from one fire escape to tile next -- a master gymnast
Three stories up, she lands on a railing, then --   out over the street, making a perfect landing on the roof of a passing

He kneels to pick it up; a brief three-word  is scrawled upon it

This sends the astounded  rushing to their radios
Right on cue,  's car pulls up

Instead she digs into her

She can't actually see him, but occasional chunks of  and  are falling to the ground as he jumps from limb to limb
For a moment it seems like she's lost him
As she sweeps the lens back and forth, scanning the trees, she catches sight of an   in the distance
She ups the magnification so she can see the plaque on the pedestal

Good to see you two
Looks like the Five Families are suddenly down to three

Is that your idea of a joke, Bruce
Not at all
Commissioner Gordon seems to think we should all be hiring bodyguards
Oh, that's absurd

He reaches for a Batarang

The huge   are still turning

It's a strategic move: when he rushes at her, she   against the ground and with startling force

Then she scurries to the edge of the roof, -- -- just as the  gives way -- and an    comes crashing out onto the roof

She squats on the ledge and smiles, beckoning to him -- Ooh
Where have you been all my life
He edges closer
Suddenly, she does a  -- hears
He hesitates a second -- moves closer to the edge of the roof --

The window of a corner apartment has been smashed; the curtains are flapping in the chill wind

He manages to brace his left foot against the wall
It's a massive strain, but he's momentarily safe if he can keep from moving
The alternative is a twelve-story drop, straight down to the pavement

With a cheshire- cat grin, she removes the  from her knapsack and holds it on the edge of the cornice

Craning his neck, he can just see the on the ledge above him -- bouncing slightly, and apparently talking to him

Seconds later, a      is spreading through the intersection

He rears the horse back, turns it in a circle; blows his piercing whistle as he tries to reroute the incoming cars
Suddenly a  wraps itself around his chest and arms
He looks down
He sees a  in the instant before a sudden pulls him cleanly off his mount

He digs in his heels, maneuvering through traffic

This is wack, man
Nothing ever happens around here anymore

This must be where the boy vigilante holes up

It's the  wielding the ax; he backs off in seeming terror as  advances on him

He spots the distinctive   in an upper vault of the cavern
It's a couple of plateaus over; a long narrow runs past it, some ten or twelve feet below

It's about to be stolen twice

She starts across the catwalk, his gun at her head

She's just passed the balcony overlooking the entry hall when  appears dead ahead in her path
He's ready to rumble -- but instead of responding, she packs it in
She stops, slumps against a wall and begins to laugh
It could've been so nice -- you and me -- if only you weren't so screwed up
It's over

Tell me something -- one thing
If you don't enjoy all this

He drops it amid the shattered glass around her face
