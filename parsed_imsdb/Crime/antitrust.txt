"" Screenplay by Howard Franklin 2001 it says: "The coolest thing
" Wow
That's hard
'd have to say it's the day we launched Outpost '98
We hear a (famous) Seattle alternative band
-  (  ) Quick cuts, seductive angles: 70 hot-air balloons rise over a vast, green corporate campus
Their mylar skins are imprinted with Outpost '98 logos; their gondolas are dressed in Outpost-colored bunting
18,000 Outpost employees cheer
They're spread out over rolling lawns, amid Arabian tents and costumed Acrobats
Over the balloon-dotted sky, the graphic re-appears: "The coolest thing
" () It's the beverages
-  (  & ) Programmer sits in his handsome office, forested landscape out the window
The screen says: ,
'95 Gary always makes sure we've got the coolest stuff to drink
of tall refrigerators: Snapples, Cokes, Fruitopias, Zaps, Jolts, Barques & Sprites are lined-up behind glass doors
"The coolest thing

-  (  & ) 24-year-old Korean-American Girl sits at the edge of a plashing, post-modern fountain
,  '97 (
) Knowing everywhere in the world, this is the software people use
of world capitals & remote places: Stockbrokers & Farmers, News Anchors & Students, 's & Eskimos boot-up Outpost '98, or log-on with Outpost Internet Traveler

) 20 years ago, Gary had an idea, that's all he had
And now the company's bigger than
Over the last shot (a Ghetto Kid uses Outpost Word in the library): "The coolest thing

) It's the people
Which is weird

, , '98 Big companies are s'posed to be impersonal
: Programmers play competitive games at an Outpost picnic; Toddlers play on computers in an Outpost Day Care Center; Geeks confer at a diagram-covered whiteboard; Employees listen/dance to the Seattle band we've been hearing, on-stage, at the Outpost '98 launch
(
) There's this myth that doing a start- up is cooler
But there's no community with a start-up
No permanence
:  / ( ) One of Mitch's colleagues is nodding

Why
'Cause we care about each other
Donny didn't mean to sound so mushy
Nobody knows where to look for a second
'Love you too, bro
As they laugh: "The coolest thing
" () 'll tell you what's not cool
How Gary gets this superbad rap
of magazine covers (Newsweek, Vanity Fair, ) featuring Gary Boyd
They say, eg: "Who Owns Cyberspace
" On a Time cover, he's composited by the Capitol Dome: " Outpost's Antitrust Woes" (
) There's this prejudice against super- smart people
People like Gary
(early 40's) reads a statement before a Congressional Sub-Committee
His voice is pleasant but firm: kid working in his garage can create the next Outpost, the new
All it takes is a great idea
bloated Senator looks hostile
That's why nobody can have a monopoly in a business built on ideas
As we watch,  pulls back from the screen on which the movie is being projected
: -  (  ) Over an audience of 40 or so computer students we read: We pick out  , watching keenly
He's 21: clear- eyed, alive, innocent
He sits with his best friend, , third-generation Chinese-American
(
) The coolest
Gary
He's like you or me
If we happened t'be insanely rich
Some appreciative laughter in the auditorium
But behind Milo,   squirms in his seat
He whispers: Can we go
(  ) For me
It's Seattle
'Starting to get nauseated
, in front of Milo, twists in his seat: Do you mind
Larry gets up
Two Outpost Recruiters,  , 31 (gray suit) and , 29 (Outpost '98 golf shirt) note the walkout
Danny scans headshots in a Stanford Yearbook
(On-screen behind them we see Seattle: night streets wet-down & shimmering; Young People entering a club; Young People climbing Mt
Shasta
) Finding Larry's picture, Danny points out the name to Redmond, who shrugs: unconcerned
Did anybody mention the beverages
- The double-doors swing open (over them, a plate reads: - ) and Larry comes out
- , a very pretty girl of 21 (more hiply dressed than the geeks) searches the hall, reading the names over the doors ( Communications Classroom, Toshiba Computer Lab, Mitsubishi Classroom)
She spots Larry
Is it over
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs
You are a fanatic
'Gonna wait outside
- Tilting down the neo-classical edifice, we read the name etched over the entrance: We find Larry and Alice sitting on the steps
(
) Alice
You gotta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me
"Make" him
(thoughtfully) You know what  mean
As we hear Larry speak, we cut back into: - The lights are on
Milo & Teddy stand by a table dressed in Outpost bunting, laden with refreshments & giveaways: mousepads, -shirts, caps & books with the Outpost logo on them (a simple contour drawing of a frontier outpost)
While most Students chat earnestly with Recruiters, Milo & Teddy load their plates with pizza and tortilla chips
(
) 'm not exactly worldly, but 'm the Secretary of State next to him
Milo puts some brownies on his plate
(
) And they're all throwing this -- stuff at him
Stock options
Pay packages
Spotting a book on the table, Milo picks it up
- 'm just screwed
(that's not true) You know what he's like
He just wants to work on stuff that's cool
You don't wanna move, do you
can paint anywhere
Larry looks at her: you didn't answer my question
'd like to stay here, yeah
And kind of think he should be with Teddy
- Milo and Teddy discuss the book almost joyfully
(We see a page of code: utterly indecipherable
) (
) mean, nobody else can follow what they're talking about half the time
/ (under Alice) 'Could be a condition-variable in the locking code -- If it didn't seg fault, first
- Maybe you shouldn't push it so hard
About Outpost
No offense, you sound insane
can't help it
feel like they'd do anything to keep their -- Anything
That's not even credible
If he wants to go up there
To check it out
think you should encourage him
(seeing Larry's incredulity) It's his life
But everybody's treating him like this -- valuable object
You're hurting your own case
- Brian, already wearing one of the Outpost caps, effuses to Redmond
He's my god
hear he actually calls recruits sometimes
Or is that an Urban Legend
Gary's running the biggest software company in the world, Brian
He's being harassed by the Justice Department, and he's got a new baby
Across the room, Milo (eating chips, perusing code) reaches for a napkin but unwittingly grabs some bunting
It unravels in a long -like streamer -- just as Danny approaches, peering at Milo's  tag
Milo
'm Danny
Oh hi
He tries to sluff the paper off his hand; Danny holds out a cell phone
Gary would like to speak to you
Milo and Teddy look at each other: right
But Danny looks like he means it
Milo's grin fades
He takes the phone
Hello
(  ) Milo
Gary Boyd
'm hoping you and your friend can come up here
We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence
'd love to show them to you
You would
Wow
When would we come
(he waits; he looks up) 'Think he hung up
Danny holds out two plane tickets, in 1st class folders
( ) - Alice examines one of the tickets almost suspiciously
But how does he know that's what you guys're working on
Larry, Teddy & Brian are at the table with Alice & Milo
It's a student hang-out, with loud music
All the companies know
The faculties tell 'em
At the target schools
In exchange for endowments
They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em
(to Teddy) can't believe you refused a ticket
My parents're already freaked-out 'm staying here
50 miles from Chinatown
Well maybe if you told 'em how much money you'd be making -- (to Milo) You're going up there
Right
think you should go
(amazed) You do
mean, it's your life
As Alice predicted, Milo is pleased by Larry's remark
"Empowered
" Larry smiles conspiratorially at Alice
& '  - In a tidy, playfully decorated room, Alice stirs in bed, sees the space next to her is vacant
- Milo sits at a desk, thinking, agitated, in the dim light of a
He looks up, sees Alice in the doorway
think  kind of lost it
was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful
'Didn't know  even cared about that stuff
'mon, how often do you talk to somebody who's been on the cover of Time
Three of four times
She picks her way through geek clutter (motherboards, code manuals, Coke cans) sits next to him
lot of what Larry says is true
They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they -- Then you've gotta ask him about that
He looks at her: you've gotta be kidding
It's important
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway
Bully
Are we talking about Gary Boyd
Or your dad
He doesn't deny it: she sees right through him
When  was a kid
And he was moving us all over the place
spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1
0
thought Gary Boyd was the greatest
But he's not quite the same guy anymore
Don't get your hopes too high
737 -    - In the cabin, everybody types on a notebook but Milo
He looks out the window expectantly: at the Seattle skyline
-  -  13 - Milo comes off the plane
Danny and Redmond greet him
/
/ - Redmond drives his black Lexus 85 m
p
h
Danny leans forward from the backseat
'Couldn't convince Teddy to come
He's pretty tight with his family
We could move 'em up here
He just likes to write code
He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything
Who do you mean by "everybody
" Milo almost blushes
He makes an awkward segue
So -- how far are we from the campus
Oh we're not going to the campus
'  -   - Beyond a rocky beach, buildings are cunningly carved into a wooded hillside
Glass walls are framed in rich wood
The main house is 28,000 sq
ft
Then there's the guest house, pool building, reception hall, library
- Redmond pulls up
discreet Guard in a Mr
Rogers cardigan recognizes him
The gates swing open
- They pull up by a Lexus  with a baby seat
Another Man in a cardigan stands in the open front door
Who's that
think they call him the "Houseman
" 'Cause "guard" sounds too weird
Milo just sits there, eyeing the monumental residence
Don't be nervous
The house is the weirdest thing about him
It's like he knows everybody expects him to be this worldly, colorful zillionaire
But he's just a guy who likes software
- -  - Milo and the Houseman cross a long room with a lake view
We hear music by Satie
The Craftsman furniture and lamps are custom-made
Cezanne hangs on the wall
- There's a Craftsman crib here, stuffed animals, another Cezanne
Even the toys seem arranged
They enter an /  - Have a seat
He won't be long
Milo sits on a bench
He tries not to look, but his childhood hero is partly visible through a glass panel in the door: Gary (in a suit and tie) has an open American face
But something goes on behind his pleasant features and self- possessed mien: his desire (or need) to solve the problem at hand is so intense it makes him appear vexed -- even vulnerable
- As Gary concentrates, two Outpost Senior Managers speak: , 40 (bald); and  , 36, (gray eyes)
We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale
Can we buy into their
Or is that a Justice Dept
problem
There is no public offering
The guy who wrote it joined some freakazoid cult in San Luis Obispo
'Wrote this just to run their web site
- Gary speaks with precise hand gestures: settling the matter
Phil and Randy gather their papers, and stand
They exit, nodding at Milo as they pass
Then Gary comes out
Milo
Excuse the tie
was on
Milo is a little dazzled as they shake hands: such a fam- iliar face, such a big figure in his young life
That's okay
-  - Now New Age music plays
They move back through the same room, but the Cezanne has been replaced by a Hieronymus Bosch (bodies roiling in Hell)
Milo is -- puzzled
The house knows the paintings  like, it knows my favorite music
Same for anybody else who's in the system
- As they walk, Milo watches a Cezanne "original" digitally re- configure to a Bosch, brushstrokes and all
Cool
Would you like a Coke or something
(too shy, too nervous) Oh
No thanks
He opens a glass-doored refrigerator, scans a shelf with rows of Snapples -- in alphabetical order
When we started,  just hired my smart friends
That was great
We got a little bigger,  had to hire smart strangers
Much harder
He selects a Kiwi-Raspberry, they walk on
Now  don't get to hire anybody
But know you're the guy to write Skywire
'  ( ) - They enter
An entire wall is taken-up by a Bosch triptych
As Gary crosses to the other side of the room, Milo stands by a table covered in art books -- hundreds of them (Soutine, Chinoiserie, Roy Lichtenstein
) You know a lot about art,  guess
There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it
Gary heads back, carrying something spherical
There's more to life than computers
'm looking into it
Glancing down at the daunting display of books, Gary looks vaguely afflicted
He mutters: 'Once  start looking into something
Looking up now (and much more at ease) he holds up a shiny, detailed metal object: model satellite
've only shown this to three other people
bought 200, we've launched 12 so far
keep the coordinates in this room
(as Milo takes it, carefully) It's left over from
Reagan's Star Wars technology
They orbit 426 miles up
Low enough to relay internet traffic
(he smiles: exactly) Among other things
We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the 's, 's, phones, etc
linked together
Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky
(turning the sleek object) Skywire
'  - Milo and Gary peer at a monitor, side-by-side
Milo sips his own Snapple now
Gary speaks his language
The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms
Really, omniplatforms
Including whatever new hardware emerges
It needs a more object-oriented language
This doesn't scale, does it
You'd have to start practically from scratch
But this is all you'd be working on
No marketing meetings, no product seminars
We can't waste the time
Half the Valley's working on convergence
So're media conglomerates, cable companies, phone companies
'Can't finish second, Milo
There is no second
Now what would you like to ask me
Milo has a deer-in-the-headlights look
Ask you
'  -   - As they walk, Milo chides himself for his reticence
Gary seems to read his mind
know what people say, and not just the Justice Department
We clone ideas, inflict our second-rate versions on the world, we haven't done anything original since 1
0
Milo's amazed by Gary's acuity
And his candor
Do  think that's fair
No
'd put some of our apps up against anybody's
But is there some truth to it
They have come to a stop in a windowed entryway
Milo watches Gary keenly
Gary nods
He knits his brow
When you get to a certain age, you start wondering
About your legacy
doubt you even remember Outpost 1
0 -- do
(pleased) Yeah
wanna feel like  did when wrote that
But 'm 42, that's 100 in cyber-years
look at you and see the things that got me here
(the furrows deepen) But somehow got away
( ) - block of floodlit "tract mansions," Taco Bell palaces of the Valley's newly rich
Milo & Alice cross a vacant lot to where the lights twinkle below
Their '89 Honda Civic is parked nearby
Milo is excited
If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once
The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary
It's his fantasy, too
think that's great, Milo
do
But
Didn't you visit the campus
forgot
That's why you have to help me decide
No way
You have this -- destiny
'mon,  wouldn't have a destiny without you
My destiny would be dying at 20
From eating -- Don't bring that up
Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die
(shrugs) You saved my life in alot of ways
He's sweet
She kisses him
He holds onto her
It's not just Gary that makes you wanna go there
'Cause it's a big place
You might not even see him again
He'd hate to think that's true
But he manages a smile
know
& '  - The Honda is loaded with luggage and boxes, some of which are tied to the roof
Milo & Alice stow a final piece
When's Brian coming for the
Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call
We'll leave it for him
As they head back in, they see a Toyota park at the curb
'Give you guys some time alone
She continues inside
He waits, watches Teddy cross the sidewalk to join him
You got my -mail
And your phone messages
You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime
Is that how Larry feels
Uh
Not exactly
brown Buick parks behind Teddy's car
As they speak, a rumpled, 50ish  in an off-the-rack suit gets out
Wanted to say goodbye to him
Hey, we got seed money for the startup
million-five
Milo grins, he high-fives Teddy
We rented a loft in Sunnyvale
(he gives Milo the number) You know what's the bad part
We can't talk about work anymore
We're competitors
The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms
Outpost made me sign 1,000
'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about
Life stuff
They embrace
It's awkward, but it's heartfelt
& '  - Milo enters, reading Teddy's phone number
Guess what
They got their -- The rumpled Man sits on a radiator, watching  on a , the last remaining piece of furniture
Alice enters, holding a jam jar filled water, hands Milo a business card
Milo, this is Mr
Barton from the Justice Department
(gives Barton the water) Sorry about the glass
Milo reads the card: Lyle Barton, Asst
Prosecutor, , Seattle Branch Office
Milo's a little spooked
Don't worry, Milo
'm here as a friend
Or maybe a supplicant
Right
What's that mean again
Beggar
We're at a disadvantage with Outpost
Our experts aren't as smart as theirs
Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly
We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights
'm taking a shot in the dark, here can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick
'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do
(fiddling with the card) It's just --  kind of feel the need to do something with my ability
Create something
Like  said: shot in the dark
Milo tries to give back the card
If you see something there that rubs you the wrong way
Do the right thing
And he goes
That took some fun out of -- We're not gonna let it
She kisses him
They head out
We linger
On  a graphic says:   , :   -
Emergency Medical Personnel roll gurneys with bodies out of a new Mediterranean mansion

Past a building under construction
To find Redmond's Lexus, cruising

' / - Milo looks out the window, Redmond gives the tour: There're 20 buildings,  mean not counting the Gyms, the Day Care, etc
The Day Care is a Michael Graves-looking building with a big cartoon-dog sculpture on its roof, ears cocked to the sky Teacher leads her little charges inside
Gary's put millions in there
And the people with kids
They're not hotshot geeks, they're just payroll clerks or whatever
Two Men in suits, with briefcases, (conspicuous amid the Geeks in jeans and -shirts) enter Building #19
You'll see alot of that: Department of Justice goons snooping around
The car pulls into a lot full of Miatas, 's, Boxters

Redmond & Milo walk over it
Milo carries a box with some personal effects, including a small painting
Redmond wears a photo

So how'd you like the house
His Snapples were in alphabetical order
(he laughs) Well, he micro-managed the company till it got too big
(he opens the door) 'Guess he needs to micro-manage something
20  - At the desk, a  looks up, stands to hang a temporary  pass around Milo's neck
Milo, 'm Judith
Welcome
Milo smiles
Redmond uses his magnetic swipe card on an inner door (a security cam is at every door); he holds the door open for Milo
- They walk up a long carpeted hallway, past open offices where Geeks (mostly males under 30) sit at workstations
Everybody has the same office, there's no dumbass corporate hierarchy
They pass a room in which Geeks play video games
Just outside it, a chubby programmer, , sips a Diet Coke
Get out while you can, dude
Desi, Milo
The guy who was at Gary's house
He bows deep, with mock-obeisance
Milo blushes, Redmond laughs, he snags Milo's elbow
They walk again, passing a service hall with a Civil Defense sign
Best bomb shelters in America, accessible from every building
You gotta figure we're a major target, right
- Up the hall, a young woman () is about to go into her office
She pauses half a second, looks at Milo, goes in
She's beautiful
Whoa
Lisa actually looked at you
As they pass her office, they look in: she's already at her workstation, studiously avoiding their gaze
Every geek here's got a thing for Lisa
But that's about the biggest reaction she's had to anybody
(shy, changing the emphasis) She's a programmer
Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps
(he all but winks) You'll be working with her
've got a girlfriend, remember
Right
That's rare around here
You know how nuns' re-married to Jesus
'Posties are married to Outpost
'  - handsome, modest office like all the others: workstation, whiteboard, window
They enter
Here's your world
(pointing at the desk) Copy of Gary's book, also the audio version, narrated by Gary
Milo puts down his box, picks up the book: The Next Highway (Gary by a highway on its cover)
As we look at it: () The card's encoded
Tells us who came through the door and when
- In an office with a bank of monitors that play feeds from security cameras,  , 40, Head of Physical Security, issues Milo his swipe card
Redmond watches
Unauthorized entries sound like this
He drags the card through a sample slot, producing an unbelievably loud, piercing
He shouts over it: If you see a tailgater, report him
Tailgater
(kills the alarm) Somebody coming in on your swipe
(gives Milo a photo ) You see somebody wandering around without , it's your duty to challenge him
don't give a shit if you're a stock-option billionaire
If you don't challenge, 'll have your butt
- He seems a little -- tense
Geeks pull his chain cause he's non- tech
Ex-cop or something
They moon cameras, or use 's as swipe cards
The cameras're our real security so he's a little demoralized
20/  - As they walk, Milo watches two Hardhats roll a spool of fiber- optic cable into the building under construction
What're they building
#21
Way behind schedule
It's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space
They see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in
Gary's not into fiber optics
He's betting everything on the satellites
You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested
They approach a 1990 Deux Chevaux, cheap but charming
Oh, right
Your girlfriend's an artist
20  - Blond wood, smoked glass -- a room as sleek as the Geeks who lunch here are nerdy
Milo and Redmond push trays
phoned her at your hotel, told her about our corporate housing options
She sounds neat
Lisa's at a table, looking at Milo
When their eyes meet, she busies herself, placing the plates back on her tray
She is
(turning away from Lisa) She is
Lisa passes behind them, smiles fleetingly at Milo
At a table, Randy and Phil note the "interaction
" Meantime: 'Might be some friction on the domestic front
You're expected you to put in ridiculous hours
People've accused us of breaking up relationships to get their undivided attention
He laughs
20  - Lisa moves swiftly up the hall
She looks up it and down it (making sure no one's looking) before ducking into '  - She goes to the box on Milo's desk (his personal effects) -- starts rooting through it
- Redmond and Milo have eaten; Redmond stacks their plates
Your counselor'll fill you in on everything else
That's who you'll be working with almost daily

He reads a complicated screen
Busy
Milo looks up
It's Gary
Milo is thrilled
No
Just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself
Okay
'm Gary
Milo's smile deepens
Gary notices the small painting (by Alice) hanging on the wall
He stares at it
'Think  should buy some originals
Do
Somebody said 'm just another Philistine
With reproductions
That's insane
You're ahead of your time
That's what  told her
My wife
Milo colors as Gary drags a second chair in front of the screen; didn't realize he was contradicting Mrs
Boyd
'Thinks 'll be less of a control freak if  have a hobby
'Just gives me something else to obsess about
Milo smiles as Gary sits down, studies the screen
Anything we can salvage from the old code before you start fresh
Milo can't quite get over: Gary's his counselor
Uh, might be one or two things
: -  '  - Two awe-struck Geeks see Gary through the window
1 He's been in there like an hour
2 Shit
'  - : Could work with a new switch
There may be a few more things hidden
Don't spend too much time searching
You ever vetted somebody's old code before
(when Milo shakes his head) It's a different skill
Stay close to the surface
The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight
You know the best place to hide a leaf, right
(when Milo shakes his head) In a tree
- We're in an old (empty) Craftsman house
Through a front window, we see Alice lead Milo up a path
As they enter: The corporate condos were as romantic as they sound
Milo's grinning as he takes in the house
- Windows give onto a garden with a small studio
Milo's still beaming, Alice is pleased
Till he says: You know he's never been anybody's counselor before
Milo
What about --
She gestures at what she hopes will be their home
Oh, It's great
It's great

One of the Agents is reading from a document: "Infotek's urgent need to license Outpost Office is such that we can use it as a tool in the current negotiation
" (looks up) When you wrote the word "tool," what'd you mean by it
Gary studies his copy of the -mail
He looks vexed
don't remember
What d'you think you meant by it
'm confused
Am  supposed to speculate under oath
The Agent shifts in his seat
We get an idea of Gary's negotiating skill (making the other party look unreasonable, while offering nothing)
Since you didn't have an answer to that question, Mr
Boyd -- ("confused" again) Didn't
Have an answer
" don't remember
" The Agents confer
Gary sees Phil, looming outside the open door
One of the Agents sees him, too
He doesn't try to hide his annoyance: Did you wanna take a break, Mr
Boyd
- Gary takes a manila envelope from Phil, opens it
Your protege's moving so fast we can barely keep up with him
Gary reads the page from the envelope: computer code
This is good
Who did it
'Start-up not 50 miles from here
Kid's on Prozac
Maybe we should all get on it
'  - Milo stares at his screen, frustrated
Gary enters
How's it going
Maybe 'm going too fast
(sharply; incredulous) Too fast
At least four companies're on the verge of workable convergence systems, Milo, they -- Catching himself, Gary trails off
He sits down, exhales
Even when  had a hand in every aspect of the company  knew the one thing you can never control is somebody's creative process
Gary seems sincerely contrite
(He needn't be: Milo just wants to please him
Besides: Milo sees he'd like to stop obsessing about convergence, to be a "worldly zillionaire," engrossed in his hobbies; but, after all, what could be more engrossing than Skywire
) It's okay
Really
(reaching into his pocket) Take a look at this
Slightly different approach
Reading the page Gary got from Phil, Milo knits his brow

You know my name
You know mine
You're famous around here
(winces) 'm getting a teacher's pet rep
wouldn't worry about it
You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets
Were you
We moved around so much  barely knew my teachers
Me too
Were you an Army brat or something
Something like that
Yeah
Didn't mean to pry
just have this theory
Some of us who got to good at this
We were -- escaping something
This seems to jolt her
She pales a little
What a mysterious girl
But this only adds to her allure
Did  say something
No,  know what you mean
used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers
Least they make sense
Sometimes you think they've betrayed you
Like a person would
But then you see, no, you just missed a step
You can go back and make it all work
This strikes a deep chord with Milo, all of it
used to wish that
All the time
They're looking at each other: he gets self-conscious
(re: the -) What've you got there
Graphical interfaces
For Skywire
'm s'posed to coordinate with you
Show me
They sit
As she inserts the disk, he finds himself looking at her
On the screen, the frontier outpost we know as the logo appears
It's struck by a bolt from the sky
The outpost comes alive with light, music, movie-images through its windows, a ringing phone
Finally, the word  burns into it
It's neat, she's really good
Cool
Yeah
ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to -- Simultaneously, they reach for the mouse
Their hands touch
They look at each other
Something happened
Sh-Show me the next one
She nods, manipulates the mouse
He stares at the screen strenuously, fighting the impulse to stare at Lisa
- ' Gary's  types as Milo enters
She smiles at him
Have a seat
He's with someone, but know he wants to see you
'  - Gary's face is red
The two Lawyers who sat in on his deposition are with him again
Because we bundled it, the judge is threatening to enjoin the whole -- 'm confused, Ted
Gary has used the phrase before, but the pretense of ingenuousness is gone; it's witheringly condescending
Didn't you tell me they'd be Chapter 12 by the time they could hope to enjoin
'm very confused, because you said they'd be ready to settle
- Milo hears Gary yelling behind the closed door
It's indecipherable, but we discern an enraged "bullshit
" Milo flips through a copy of Wired, trying to ignore it
The Lawyers come out, passing swiftly, rather grimly
Go on in
(when Milo looks dubious) He's always happy to see you
'  - Agitated, Gary rather compulsively lines-up the papers, pens, etc
on his desk; he barely hears the knock at the open doorframe
Milo
What's up
Well -- you sent for me
Right
Right
Still distracted, he finds a page of code on his desk, gives it to Milo
Once again, Milo marvels
You really wrote this just today
(dark, unsmiling) What're you implying
(taken aback) Nothing
Their eyes are locked
Gary blinks, sags into his chair
Everything  do is under scrutiny
The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid
(knits his brow) 'm confused
Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead
(uncomfortable) 'm sure
The purpose of this company isn't to destroy our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath
But the software business is binary: you're a zero or a one
Being obsessive isn't a crime
It's a character trait
Milo just wants to get out
He studies the code to hide his discomfort
Gary watches him
It scales, don't you think
Definitely
He smiles
For the first time it looks forced
- youthfully upscale place, a converted red-brick warehouse
Alice looks great
The Waiter pours wine
This feels fairly grown up, 'd say
Milo smiles (again it looks forced) raises his glass
To our new life
(she's looking at him) What's wrong
That's what  need to ask you
(when he says nothing) You know you can't keep anything from me
He gave me some new code-fixes this morning
said, "Did you really do this just today
" Cause  was impressed
He said "What're you implying
" She just looks at him
He grows a little defensive: It's the way he said it
Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie
That's how you knew you were onto something ugly
(just confused) What would it mean, anyway
If he didn't write it
That's what 'm asking myself
Does he have some genius stowed away
Why not let him write Skywire
(upset) 'Not saying it makes sense
Busboy leaves a basket of rolls
Glum, preoccupied, Milo takes one without looking, brings it to his lips -- Milo
He looks at Alice, looks at the roll, blanches
'm so stupid
He throws the roll back into the basket
He's your boss
He's not your -- (he's nodding) know,  know
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor
(the very idea hurts) Isn't that -- extreme
What's extreme is what that  doctor said when he pumped your stomach
Eat another sesame seed and that's it
We see the rolls: covered in seeds
mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much -- You're right
It's -- a working relationship
Don't know what  was expecting
He smiles
But his heart's not in it
She hates to see him suffer
She picks up her glass
'mon
Let's do the toast
- Milo sits alone, marking up pages of code as he eats
He doesn't notice Lisa, standing with her tray
Did you wanna be alone
No
Please
He indicates she should sit
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps
How fast are you going
"There is no second place
" Plus every time  get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration
(looks at her, curious) Is it like that with your counselor
Mine's not the
He barely remembers to take a shower
Right, right
But does he ever just, like, hand you code
Maybe once
re-wrote it, anyway
(he smiles) You're compulsive
Mmm-more like --  have a little trouble
Trusting people
Why's that
Long story
Not that interesting
She smiles charmingly to cover whatever she's feeling
The more enigmatic she is, the more intrigued he is
20  - Milo and Lisa walk, eat ice cream out of paper cups with Outpost logos
They laugh
We go nearer
So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers
Was that then
Or now
Then and now
(when he looks at her) But not right now
She maintains eye contact
Her meaning is clear
Milo
Milo turns, sees Brian (Stanford classmate, Outpost zealot) give an envelope to a Guard at the door of #20; he trots over to Milo, who is as flustered as another guy might be having been found in bed with a girl
Just dropped off a resume
Almost got in the front door
He looks at Lisa, back to Milo, wondering why he isn't being introduced
You're living here
'Thought if  relocated it could help my case
'm writing programs for the local public access station
Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show
God, does it suck
(gives him a business card) Can you help me
Sure, 'll see what  can do
Seeing how flushed Milo is, Brian thinks he must have blundered in on something
He starts to back away
Well  parked illegally
See y'later
(watching Brian go) 'Forgot to introduce you
(a beat) have a girlfriend
That's great
-- didn't know
She saved my life
- The station is closed
Milo's car is parked, empty
(
) How's it going down there
We find him, in an illuminated phone booth
(  ) 've been hacking for five night's straight, 'm really making headway
: '  () - funky space, posters on the wall, a red Stanford pennant, rubber trees at either end of his desk
But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week
What
On the wall beyond Teddy the word  (in blood red) has been covered over with paint but still bleeds through
They're in the neighborhood
They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers
Jesus, Teddy
'm cool
They didn't touch the machine
Or my disks
Probably didn't know what they were
So, you a Moonie yet
(he waits) Milo
met this girl
What
Come on
Is it serious
don't know
Did you tell Alice
No
keep thinking it'll go away
But there's this -- connection
She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot
Plus see her every day, we're working on the same program
She's -- beautiful
beautiful geek
don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances
What d'you mean
dunno
guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place
What does that mean
Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends
Most don't have one
didn't plan this
#20  - Through a window, we watch Milo traverse the quad
(
) What'd the girl say
There may be a little less trust after your outburst
We are '  - Gary turns back inside, where Phil reads Milo's new code
Hasn't affected his work, though
Nothing does
Still
want him to like me
Phil is confused by Gary's sincerity; so is Gary
#20   - Desi and another Geek watch in astonishment: Gary walks Milo to his car, his arm circled over Milo's shoulder
He seems to be -- apologizing
/
& '  - Milo comes eagerly up the path: can't wait to tell Alice what just happened
He enters -- pulls up short
Alice is waiting for him
She's white
What's wrong
She doesn't know how to say it
What
Teddy was killed last night
What're you -- what
It was a hate crime
Milo is staggered
She moves to him
'm sorry
'm so sorry
He hangs onto her, for support
( ) - Establish the funky building, vestiges of police tape on the door, a limo and many cars parked out front
-   - mixture of Teddy's relatives and Computer Friends have gathered
In the , Teddy's Dad weeps volubly
'  - Teddy's brother, , shows Milo the workspace: red Stanford pennant, rubber trees on the desk
Milo, in a suit, peers at the painted-over epithet on the wall
They trashed his hard disk, all his back-ups
Nothing's left
They caught the guys
Nelson shows Milo a San Jose Mercury: mugshots of two skin- headed Aryan Nations Members in their 20's
It's an airtight case
They found the weapon with Teddy's blood on it and their fingerprints
They'd been arrested twice for beating-up Asians
How come they weren't in jail
Milo unpins a picture of himself & Teddy from a board
He told me about the break-in
He didn't seem to take it that seriously
You guys don't take anything seriously do you
That's not on a hard drive
Milo is stung by this
Alice appears in the doorway
Nelson
Your mom wants you
It's time to go to scatter the ashes
Milo is pinning the picture back up
The pushpin falls to the floor, he kneels to retrieve it
On the floorboards, he sees a thin, shiny plastic filament
He picks it up
didn't know he was working with fiber optics
But when he looks up, Nelson's gone
We gotta go too, honey
As he heads out with Alice, he unthinkingly stuffs the filament in his suit pocket
- raw beautiful bluff
The sea stretches to infinity behind a smaller group of Mourners
intones the Lord's Prayer
- Milo approaches Larry with trepidation
Larry nods, it's okay
They hug each other
They walk slowly back toward the cars
know you lost all his work
Maybe could come down here and -- You are naive
Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years
(he smiles sadly) Not that  don't miss you
Just thought his work should go on
He was on the verge of something, too
He was gonna show us the next day
He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band
" Know what it means
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up
Man, could he write code
Totally elegant
He had his own style
Those really weird, short lines
They smile
For a moment, they've brought Teddy back to life
Alice comes up from behind, to fetch Milo
Take good care of this guy
20 - Arriving for work, Milo sees Outpost flags at half mast
- As Milo comes up the hall, Lisa is standing there
We get the feeling she's been waiting for him
You okay
He looks at her, perhaps hearing Teddy's words ("what're the chances
")
He nods, moves on
She watches him head up the hall
'  - Milo types
There is a rapping on the doorframe
Gary
heard what happened
Were the flags for Teddy
Gary nods
Spontaneously Milo stands, hugs Gary
Had you talked to him much lately
Just once
'Guess  was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits
Non- disclosure
Did you
Talk about work
Never
meant did you find other stuff to -- Oh
Yeah
You've been coming in early
It helps
Alice said it would help
To focus on something
(a little guilty) 'Don't know what 'd do without her
& '  - Milo sits on the couch, in dim light
Alice comes in
You okay
(sits by him, holds him) miss him, too
: - Milo eats alone
Through the window, he sees Lisa inside
She's eating alone, too
Gary comes trotting up
Milo
He is unclasping a manila envelope; he takes pages out
Wow
You must have 20,000 lines of code there
34,000
But they're real short lines
'Just came out that way
Seeing Gary's code, Milo knits his brow: it must be sort of like -- Teddy's
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler
And it came over me: it's in the wrong place
(an uncertain smile) The wrong place
The answer's not in the box
It's in the band
Milo's smile freezes
As he stares at Gary, we zoom with a reverse dolly so that the background retreats queasily but Gary remains dominant in frame
For Milo, it feels like the very ground is going out from under him
Gary continues to explain, pointing at lines of code
And Milo pretends to listen
But he can't even make out the words Gary speaks -- he hears only a jumble of echoes
Milo nods mechanically; he wants to scream
Or run
He perceives, amid the echoes, that Gary is standing, smiling, saying "See you later
" And he's gone
Milo touches the pages, like some talisman of Teddy
(
) Milo
You okay
It strikes him she always shows up at these moments
He gathers his wits before looking up
Gotta go home
'Think  ate something
/
' /   - Pulling out of the lot, Milo seizes the car phone
He hits on the speed-dial
Gets a busy signal
Rings off
He's about to press re-dial when he sees the Outpost logo branded on the receiver
He throws it down like it's contaminated
& '  - Middle-of-the-day sounds: chirping birds, school children
Milo pulls to the curb at a bad angle
/ / - He fumbles with his keys
When he gets inside: Alice
Alice
He moves into the bedroom
He sees her through the window, painting in the studio
/
/ - He stands outside the studio
Waits for her to look up
She does
She smiles
Then she sees something's wrong
He waits for her to come out here, where it's safe to speak
- He paces, agitated
She watches him
She's skeptical, but doesn't want to appear unsympathetic
Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death
Nelson said it was an airtight case
don't know what 'm saying
Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys
can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that
don't know
just know it was Teddy's code
All these ideas flying in from everywhere
You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business
" It's like they know what every kid's doing
They hack into people's programs
Nobody does work like this on-line
It's in your , or in a mainframe
Self-contained
They'd have to be, like, watching people
Physically
(he freezes) Oh Jesus
- Milo's at the closet, rummaging among the clothes hanging there
Alice comes up behind him
He finds his suit jacket
He digs in one pocket, then another
He finds the fiber optic strand (from Teddy's floor)
Shows it to her
(almost silently) It's a camera
- They've trooped back outside
She's worried she's indulging his paranoia
It isn't a broadcast studio
It's -- a surveillance post or something
That's why they have the dishes on top
You're scaring me
think we should just go
Go where
You can't get away from people like this
"Like this
" It's Gary you're talking about
(it really hurts) You think  don't know that
Milo
Why would he -- How should  know
"Solving a problem,"  guess
Or needing to control everything
don't know
(can't think about it) 've gotta get in there
Even if all this were true
There're 20 other buildings
All of them filled with computers and -- It's the only one with dishes on the roof
The studio's a front
That's why they keep postponing its opening
(muttered, obsessive) gotta get in there
Milo, you told me those  Agents are all over the place
How could they hope to hide a surveillance post
(as he mulls this) And how can you get in there, anyway
With the cameras and the swipe cards -- can't just walk away
You can't just walk in, either
They stop the construction work at six or seven
The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning
Even the early Geeks don't get there before five
Is it two
Or is it three
Have you ever really noticed
He knows what she's saying: he's unqualified for this, a space-cadet
She tries to hold him
But he wriggles away
No
can't just keep my head in the sand
That's how  got into this mess
He paces, he thinks
She watches him, worried
know how to get in there
But you've gotta help me
(scared, reluctant) Whaddo  do
So you believe me
She can't lie
She shakes her head
Just tell me what to do
: '  - Standing at his window, Milo can see #21
Workers in Hardhats come out of it, carrying lunchboxes
Milo holds a small writing pad
He notes the time
-  ( ) Alice parks in front of a drugstore
As she gets out of the car, she looks around uneasily
- ( ) Alice is at the counter, buying a wind-up alarm clock
'  -     (
) Milo watches a car pull out of the parking lot, leaving only one or two others
He writes down the time
- ( ) Alice is at the counter, among children and mothers, purchasing a chemistry set
'  -  ( ) He watches a   () go into #21 on his rounds, notes the time: 3:45
& ' -  -  ( ) Alice, wearing dishwashing gloves, ties the alarm clock to a small Tupperware container with copper wire
Milo (wearing latex gloves) is at the sink, mixing chemicals from the toy chemistry set
Alice approaches with the container affixed to the clock
As she holds it out Milo pours the mixture into it
: we hear ticking
The screen lightens to show: ( 20) Milo's alarm clock is set for 11:00
It sits amid mops and cleaning products
20  - Milo stands in the open door of a refrigerator, as if searching for a soda
He's looking up the hall, waiting for someone
He consults his watch
10:53
Come on
Here comes a ; he nods to Milo as he passes
The Guard opens a door with his card
Milo rushes through the door on the Guard's swipe -- "tailgating
" Sir, you gotta use your own -- (noticing) Where's your
Milo cops an attitude
He's not completely convincing
Do you know who  am
It's my job,  gotta -- (he's getting better) The kind of stock options 'm sitting on
- Bob Shrot, the ex-cop in charge of physical security, looks up as the Guard escorts Milo into the room
- The bomb explodes
The blast is tiny but loud (glass cleaning bottles ring; plastic bottles moan)
- Milo sits, watches Shrot encode a new card for him, finding his info on a terminal
On a monitor behind Shrot, Milo sees Programmers being ushered out of the building
Every geek has to try this once to show me how smart he is -- rushes in
There was an explosion in a -sector closet, we're evacuating the whole sector
Shrot comes to his feet, grabs a holster (with gun) off a shelf
Milo, looking flummoxed, stands
Un-nh, can't wander around without now
Just park your ass in that chair
Milo sits
Shrot goes out with the Guard
(
) Whole place reeks of fuckin' ammonia
Milo moves quickly to the wall, reads a chart with the Guards' Schedule, runs his finger down it til he finds the name of the Guard on the 3  shift: ,
-     - Guards open closet doors, shine their flashlights
- Milo has moved to Shrot's seat
He's encoding a fresh card with Ken Delbert's information
- Panning off the civil defense sign we find Shrot standing at a closet, examining a piece of the alarm clock
- Milo is at work, bringing up schematic screens, diagnosing the system with his unique concentration
Panning to the window, we see the evacuated Programmers enjoying themselves on the lawn
It's a rare, exciting event: they jump around, miming explosions
- Shrot and the Guard collect pieces of the bomb out of the debris, puts them in a tray
- Milo brings up the screen that controls the #21 cameras
On the monitors, he sees nothing very interesting: a hallway, a room under construction
He pulls down a menu
is highlighted
He clicks The image hardly changes, but a Guard wanders through
He types, the tape rewinds (the Guard moves backwards)
He finds a neutral spot (showing an empty hallway), stops the tape
- Gary, Randy & Phil approach Shrot; Gary stares at him
What is it
Not much
Glorified cherry bomb
Right by the civil defense sign
Some geek's idea of irony
been saying we need a camera in this hall
There's nothing in this hall
Someone's pulling your chain, as usual
(thinking aloud) Unless it's a diversion
Milo's in my office
He was tailgating, so  -- Gary explodes, with incredulity
Milo
Try to have a clue
Try to think
Gary strides off
Shrot feels unfairly maligned
That kid's the great white hope
could get it out of him
You're not listening
Randy and Phil head up the hall
Shrot watches them
Even if his "intellectual superiors" are convinced of Milo's innocence, he isn't
He walks swiftly back toward his office
Then he runs
- Milo reads a warning message /
He types
The glitch freezes the tape (we see it lock into place): it shows the empty hallway
- They've let the Programmers back in
They head up the hall as Shrot heads down it
He pushes past them gruffly
He knows he's enhancing his Neanderthal image (they make cracks) but he's more interested in obeying his instinct
- Milo immobilizes another camera in #21
and another
Shrot rounds the corner
His office is in view, now
- Milo, at the keyboard, closes up windows, one by one
- Shrot is back, he has only to round the corner to see Milo
We assume his  as he does so: Milo sits in the chair where Shrot left him
Everything okay
'  - Pan off the clock (3:20 ) to find Milo at his desk, looking at the clock with a certain dread
It's time
20  - Milo walks the path between the two buildings, fiddling nervously with the dummied swipe card
Hearing footfalls behind him, he whirls: it's a Geek loping to his car
He smiles
Milo smiles: waits, walks on
Nearing #21, Milo looks around, making sure no one else is around
His  (panning):  Programmer works late, visible through a lighted window in #20
The dog sculpture with cocked ears sits atop the Day Care, its quizzical expression seeming to wonder what Milo is up to
The Geek he just saw racing by on foot now pulls out of the parking lot in his James Bond
Milo arrives at the entrance
Heart pounding, he brings the card to the slot
Will he trigger that awful alarm
He slides the card, the door clicks
21 -  - He enters: concrete floor, unpainted walls, construction lights
At the inner door he looks up at the camera
: that shows us where Milo stands, minus Milo
Widen: - packs up his stuff, getting ready to go home
The new guard,   enters
How's it goin'
(shaking out his cup) Big night
Switched from tea to coffee
Brought new meaning to my work
Yeah
Maybe 'll start my rounds with #21 tonight
You are a wild man
21 -   - Milo moves up a hall with unpainted walls, bare floors, unconnected wires
The only illumination is from construction lights on the concrete floor
Opening doors, he sees: Bare rooms
Wall plates ready to receive electrical equipment, bundles of wire hanging out
In other words: the building is as advertised, so far
20 - Delbert comes out with his flashlight, heads across the clean- swept path that leads to #21
21 -  - Milo nears a set of double-doors at the end of the hall
He hears a low ominous hum from within
Convinced he's found something, he quickens his pace
He's about to swipe his card when a beam of light bounces along the wall
He presses himself into an alcove
Through a chink in the unfinished wall he sees: Delbert come in the front door
His rounds consist of shining his torch up at the cameras, making sure the red lights are on
He walks right past Milo (who doesn't breath)
Delbert swipes open the double doors, leans in: the humming gets louder
: pressing himself into the alcove
Delbert turns around, heads back down the hall
exits the building
Milo waits a beat before heading to the end of the hall
Using the card, he enters studio-to-be, architectural touches like soffits framed in but not plaster-boarded
The portentous hum comes from around a corner
He approaches, convinced the answer lies here
Clearing the wall he sees: squat emergency generator sitting on the floor, powering construction lights
Something you'd buy at Sears
#21 /   - ( ) Through infra-red binoculars we see Milo come out, looking left and right, to make sure he hasn't been observed
() Well
Now he knows: nothin' in there
We are '  -
20 - Randy turns back into the room, where Phil is sifting through papers spread over a coffee table
Maybe he'll get back to work
Speaking of which
Yeah, yeah
Randy pulls the blinds shut, joins Phil
- From a high angle, we track Milo, as he walks along the path to a bench
The camera passes briefly behind a dark object in the foreground (dog sculpture) as we track him
-  - Milo sags onto the bench
He stares out, perplexed, suffering
Then he knits his brow
He seems to be studying -- the ground
Or rather the shadow stretched out in front of him: the looming silhouette of the dog atop the Day Care
He stands up, turns around
: The whimsical canine
Push toward it's ears cocked to the sky
Then toward a single ear, framed by fur-brown concrete, but with a smooth, concave inner surface of enamelled metal: satellite dish
(muttering) in a tree
- At the entrance, Milo applies the swipe-card
- He steps in on colorful carpeting, amid balls & tricycles
Kid's artwork hangs on the wall
He moves through this room, into the 20 screens glow
They hang suspended over a wide, ringed table, a chair at each keyboard
Indeed, Gary has spared no expense for the toddlers: they're flat, sleek, digital screens
At the moment, they show colorful, childish contour drawings that say     (e
g
: a spaceship)
There are a dozen more screens on tables at the perimeter of the room showing screensavers (eg: angelfish swimming)
Milo moves slowly around the table, studying the screens
Not surprisingly, most of the     drawings are of desks or tables with computers
Tracking just ahead of Milo, we get to a screen that shows a workstation with a red pennant on the wall, a rubber plant at each end of a desk
Even in contour form it's -- familiar
Milo passes it
And comes back to it
Staring at it, he sits
He begins typing
[The drawing still occupies the screen, but in a window he's brought up at the bottom, there is dense, -looking code
] He types furiously -- numbers, symbols, backslashes
Whatever he's trying to do is a challenge even to him
He deletes lines, begins anew, his frustration evident
As he works through the layers of code, the pixels on the screen start to fill in
The contour lines slowly dissolve into a live broadcast image of Teddy's workstation in Sunnyvale (eerily empty, now)
When all the pixels have fallen into place, Milo hears from every direction, as all the screens in the room fill in with live broadcast images
All of them show variations on a theme: workstation seen by a camera over-the-shoulder of a programmer (if he were present)
The stations are of various shapes and sizes, but in each case we have an unobstructed view of screen & keyboard
At this hour, few programmers are present
One guy has fallen asleep, his head on a desk Japanese Geek is hard at work: it's day there
'  - Phil and Randy work at the coffee table
Did you download Corey
In San Jose
Damn
'Have to go back over there
(he stands, stretches) Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door
You don't look anything like a three- year-old
-   - Milo works the keyboard
Again, the code gets dense and obscure as he goes deeper
He succeeds in calling-up a graphical interface
Among the menus he can choose from are: ,  ,
He clicks Target Schools, a menu shoots down (Berkeley, Cal Tech, etc
)
He clicks Stanford, then Chin, Teddy
Two windows open
In one, there is a video stream of Teddy winning an award in the Gate's Bldg
In the other, uploaded police video stenciled  ) of the White Supremacists whose mug- shots we saw in the San Jose Mercury; they're being interrogated
In the first window, Teddy's image dissolves into a handheld crime-scene video (marked -) of a ransacked grocery store
"
" is painted on a wall
Milo looks confused: some "narrative" is unfolding, but it remains obscure without audio
He types some more
In the bottom window, he brings up convoluted text regarding the audio
About the only phrases we can understand are: "Audio Block " and "Hardware Requirement: Magnetic Filter Type -R17
" His eyes cast about the room for some suitable hardware substitute
He digs in his shirt pocket
He takes out his swipe card, studies it
He casts about some more, till he sees some kids' safety scissors in a jar
20 -   - Randy whistles as he heads up the hall
Arriving at the door with the Civil Defense sticker, he swipes his card
- On-screen, long-lens footage shows a low building; the Aryan Nations suspects come out of it
still photo appears in the 2nd window: a steel hasp
Milo's eyes are narrowed: what am  seeing
Meantime, he is reaching under the table where he has removed a plate from the mainframe terminal, exposing hardware within
He has trimmed the swipe card to size and is wedging its magnetic strip into a metal slot
He wiggles the card
We hear an eerie fibrillation, which flattens into the voice of a serene, eminently sane female: -- run this methamphetamine lab known to Federal Authorities, per  47, from which we removed the implement, fingerprints intact
Crime-scene video streams in now stenciled  by the time/date)
handheld camera pans a blood-spattered wall then shows a mutilated Asian murder victim
(All of this footage is made even eerier by the jerky glitches always present in streaming video, and its sinister graininess
) footage, procured by  47, shows the aftermath of an Aryan Nations' killing in Denver
Note the evidence of torture, which is typical
Milo pales as he realizes he is watching a primer on how racial killings are done
He hears a creaking noise behind him, and whirls
It's the classroom hamster, on his wheel
/  - Still whistling, Randy descends some metal stairs, enters a vast bomb shelter (canned foods, etc
) -   - Milo has tapped into his own file: footage of him lecturing at Stanford (as an ), pointing to a whiteboard
-- complete immersion in code-writing renders him both unobservant and suggestible [click]
On two occasions he went truant from classes to attend Comix Conventions
The audio crackles and drops out again
Milo's eyes narrow: he sees video of Alice, sitting on a folding chair, speaking to someone
She has a harder look, pulls on a Marlboro
What's he seeing
He wiggles the jerry-rigged hardware almost urgently, till the narration crackles back on: -- Rebecca , a Connecticut art stu- dent facing Federal drug charges, whose records were supplied to us by 47
He hears her voice under the Narration, answering an unseen Interrogator (sounds like Phil)
It's a job interview
Milo subtly, unconsciously shakes his head, as if to deny what his eyes see
The narration begins to fibrillate, again: (
) Armed with his personal files, she was easily able to ingratiate herself with the socially maladroit Milo -- The audio drops out as Milo sees uploaded medical files and photos of himself marked   : he's waxen, bloated, gasping for breath
With a certain dread, Milo jams the card in deeper: she planted the sesame seed both to test the extent of his proclivity and to provide a bonding experience, since she would quote "save his life
" Milo is devastated, disbelieving
Now he sees real-time footage: an Allergy Victim, bloated, twitching, gasping, dying
-- should it be needed Milo's allergy is the ideal -- The audio crackles out
But Milo doesn't have the heart to bring it back: he can fill in the rest
- Randy traverses a well-lit tunnel
Still whistling
-    - Numb now, Milo clicks randomly: crime footage, personal records, animations -- it all flies by with Chuck Worman- like speed
Note that the cult members are found reclining after swallowing the [click] Syringe marks best hidden at base of scrotum [click] mimics high blood alcohol [click] indistinguishable from kidney failure
Milo closes his eyes, leans back: overwhelmed
Suddenly he sits forward, whispers almost fervently as he types: Please don't be one of them
- -   - Camera moves slowly through stacks of pre-school supplies, toward a windowed door at the back of the room
appears in the window, lit ominously from below
He applies his swipe card
- Milo watches footage of Lisa taken by surveillance cam- eras: she is outside #21, trying to peek in the door
needs to be watched, due to her heightened level of suspicion -- In one window, footage of Lisa casing the hallway before going into Milo's office; in another, footage of her eating lunch with Milo
-- and to her possible contagion of key employees
Milo clicks
's pair of mug shots appear
In the other window, a grade-school yearbook photo of Lisa
In August '86 Lisa informed her mother of the sexual molestation by her stepfather, and of his threat to kill her should she tell anyone
Milo watches streaming local news footage of a man being taken from a courtroom in shackles (jerky, grainy)
He's lost the audio, but doesn't need it, anymore
- Randy climbs up to the main floor
whistling
-   - Milo watches eerie crime-scene footage: a Girl with her throat slashed
But then, hearing nearly-distant whistling, he clicks on windows furiously: closing them
- Randy rounds a corner
He enters the - The screens show the children's contour images, again
Where's Milo
Randy takes a seat at the same console Milo was at, and begins to type
Camera booms slowly down beneath table-level to find: hanging onto the underside of the table, knuckles white, as he clings to metal table braces
The toes of his sneakers are jammed into the space between a black plastic data tower and the table bottom
Randy shifts in his seat, his knee rising toward Milo's back
Milo arches it, avoids a knee by mere millimeters
: brings up a shot of a Programmer at work, zooms in on his screen to begin collecting his code
: begins to lose his grip as sweat forms on his brow and, worse, on his hands
They're giving way
: clicks
printer across the room start making a hard- copy of the purloined code
: stares in horror as the data tower his toes are jammed on top of starts to shift -- threatening to disengage from its ports
He tries to lift it back up with heels of his shoes
: knits his brow as his screen flickers
He keeps typing, but starts to lower his head: he's going to look under the table
: winces as he presses the tower upward with his heels, while trying to maintain his balance
: lowering his head, keeps his eyes on the screen, hits keys
Just as he is about to clear the level of the table -- the screen re-illumines
He comes back up
: having extended his legs to support the tower, feels his hands slipping
: closes up the window
: flops to the carpet(
) just as -- pushes away from the table
From the floor watches him walk over to the printer, collect his hardcopy, and disappear from view
Milo listens: the door clicks shut, the whistling recedes
- Milo traces Randy's steps
He sees the door with the Civil Defense sticker, intuits how Randy got here, i
e, how one moves, unobserved, between the Day Care and #20
He sags against the wall
Wondering what to do, now
/
' / - Milo sits in his idling car, staring at his own house, up the street
How can he go in there
He puts the car in gear, does a -Turn
-  - The Deux Chevaux is parked on the street outside a government building
Not many people are around, yet
Janitor hoses down the sidewalk
- Milo slides a business card across a reception desk
It's the one the rumpled Prosecutor, Lyle Barton, gave him that day in Palo Alto
(
) He gave me this
'Said  should come see him if -- He's not in yet
Can  wait in his office
It's locked, dear
He looks over his shoulder, then back again, frightened
Please
Wait in his outer office
'   - Milo sits on a wooden bench, foot tapping
Hearing Barton's voice, he comes to his feet
Barton enters with a Co-Worker, holding a container of coffee, discussing the particulars of a case
- Do  make the call, or do you
Milo is relieved the second he sees Barton's kindly face
Mr
Barton, do you remember me
It's -- Milo, isn't it
Yes sir
need to talk to you
Give me two seconds with Lacy here
(unlocks his door) Go on in,  won't be a moment
Milo enters as Barton finishes up with his colleague
(
) 'll make the call, but  think you need to send a Fax first (etc
)
'  - Milo paces
He surveys framed diplomas, commendations and photos on the wall
He takes comfort in their solidity: pictures of Barton's teenage Kids, Barton and Wife at the Grand Canyon
There's a college football photo, a young Barton with his team
Milo studies it, smiles
Move in on the photo, till we see the number on Barton's Notre Dame football jersey: 47
Milo's smile fades
It takes a moment before he even hears Barton behind him
Milo
Yeah
Hi
Thank you for seeing me
Have a seat
As Milo takes the seat in front of the desk (mind spinning) Barton moves to his own chair
What seems to be the problem
You look a little upset
am
am, sir
What's he gonna say
Milo
My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley
My goodness
It was racially motivated
He's Chinese
He was
And
know sometimes the  gets involved with that
Don't they
If there's a Civil Rights violation
But generally we let the local police and  do their work first
-- just wanna help bring these guys to justice
They're neo-Nazis
Let me look into it, see what's being done
Frankly, it's not my area
(he gets up) 'Just didn't know who else to talk to
(circles an arm over Milo) And Outpost
You're happy there
Yes sir
& '  - Alice is on the phone in the front room
Agitated, she puffs on a pencil (surrogate cigarette)
We hear Phil through the receiver: (  ) 'Didn't mention he was going to the Justice Department
No
: '  - Not like him, is it
To do a thing like that without telling you
You're not losing your hold on him, are you
He'll tell me when he gets home
That'll be a test, won't it
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl
Fire her
Or something
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team
We've got our eyes on her
You keep yours on Milo
(as she hangs up) Prick
& '  - Milo comes up the path
He pauses as he nears the door: he's not sure he can pull this off
- As Milo enters, Alice rushes to meet him
It's almost nine, 've been so worried
(she takes his hands) What did you see in there
Nothing
Nothing
She watches him as he collapses onto the couch
It's what they said it is
An unfinished broadcast studio
You were right
just drove to Seattle and back
Why
Remember Lyle Barton
She shakes her head
The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when -- remember
After  broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me
--  just drove around
Trying to figure out what possessed me
You know what
've been putting my own guilt on Gary
Guilt
(quietly) If 'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened
Poor baby
You know that's not true
She sits by him, touches her hand to his face tenderly
He closes his eyes for a moment, steels himself to her touch
Then he forces himself to cup his hand over hers
But he can't stand it
He gets up, looks out the window
thought, instead of indulging all these paranoid delusions, risking my job, alienating Gary, scaring you, should do something useful with my grief
Help them find Teddy's killers
He doesn't see her smile: is that all
Assuming an appropriately concerned expression, she moves toward him: was so worried about you
She turns him around, kisses him
Her eyes are closed
His remain open
He's looking at her
Trying to comprehend the treachery
She touches him, breathes heavily
She wants more than kisses: to prove to herself how wrong Phil was, her professional pride insulted
Or perhaps it's more personal than that, especially with Lisa as a potential rival
(through their kisses) been such a long night
But she doesn't stop
She moans as she presses herself to him: wants proof of his devotion
- He's on top of her in the moment just after
Her eyes are closed
He stares at her -- glares at her -- with what we recognize as spent anger
That was -- different
Different
Shit
She knows
You didn't feel it
So intense
What's clear is, she liked it
clap of thunder takes us to: - It's pouring
Milo stands outside, wearing a slicker, looking in the window at someone
- Lisa reads a paperback at a table, a slice of pizza on her plate, an umbrella hooked to her chair
Sensing someone standing over her, she looks up
She smiles
So you're not avoiding me
Milo sits across from her
He doesn't know where to start
What's wrong
He looks around, wants to make sure no one's listening
He speaks very quietly
snuck into #21
Why would you do a thing like -- You thought about it too
You've been suspicious for a while
But it's not happening in there
It's happening in the Day Care
The Day Care
Two Men with even features enter the restaurant
One has a laptop case slung over his shoulder
Can we go someplace else
- They're in a bandshell
The rain falls heavily, drips off the eaves
She holds the filament from Teddy's workspace
It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em
They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files
They'd be happy just to steal code forever
But when a program gets close to fruition
Like Teddy
He was almost there
But why would they --
You know
There is no second place
And what's the risk
The killings're undetectable, they're hand-tailored, they make "sense
"  mean, they're in the information business
They have scenarios for all of us, too
In case we find out too much
She's peering at him
He reads her mind
'm not one of them
Not trying to "suss you out
" She wants to believe him
They killed my best friend
'm living with somebody they pay to go to bed with me
Can't you trust somebody just once
don't wanna be alone here
His plea is so ardent, his humanity so transparent
But she can't quite do it
'm sorry, Milo
'm sorry
She smiles sadly as she backs away
(forcefully) know why you're so secretive
Why you won't let anybody near you
(quieter) know what he did to you
Oh yeah
She tries to sound tough; there are tears in her eyes
So that's in my -- file
He wants to comfort her
He takes a step toward her
She shakes her head: no
Is that my -- scenario
(when he hesitates) Tell me
They'd frame him
(horrified) He's out of prison
(he nods) They're already watching you
If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout
He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge
" She draws her hands to her face as the facade cracks
She weeps silently
He moves to her, carefully, slowly, seeing her fear, her trauma
He touches her shoulders
She tenses, tries to back away
No
But he holds on
Nobody's gonna hurt you
Slowly, he wraps his arms around her
She remains tense for a moment, then yields, pressing her face into his shoulder
The rain drums on the bandshell
After a moment: Milo
Hmm
always felt if a -- boy  liked ever found out -- he'd run
He'd think  was unclean
No, no
Never
She clings to him tightly, now, the wall of her mistrust breached after all the years of pain, secrecy, shame
wide shot: they hold each other, alone in the storm
() All his suspicions were allayed
-  - Alice nods
She sits in front of leather-bound books
You're sure
She's at Gary's house
On the hot seat
Phil and Randy watch her
Gary does, too, but deep in shadow, behind a desk, at a remove
Rain falls heavily on the Lake
He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that cliche about great minds was true
Said it was all about his own guilt
(she shrugs) Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while
It always passes
He wasn't acting
don't think he knows how
Phil looks convinced
Gary doesn't
/  - From across the highway (cars with morning commuters whiz by) we see Milo pumping gas at a self-serve; Lisa fills-up in the next lane
Ostensibly, they have run into each other on the way to work
They are smiling, casual
Only when we cut close do we see that their expressions bear no connection to their words
What about the
They've got this guy in the , maybe others
We tell the wrong person, it's over
Who can we trust
There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question
She defines it: How do you let go of a secret without telling the wrong person
She pretends to need help lifting her car hood: "a helpless female
" He comes over to help her
We don't tell anybody
(she's puzzled) We tell everybody
At once
So there's no secret left to protect
When everybody knows, they don't dare touch us
- Bob Shrot is on the phone
Behind him, a nerdy security programmer,  , is at the console that controls the security cameras (the ones Milo futzed with)
(into the phone) No, Tony can't fill in for you, he's not at your authorization level
Scrolling, Len knits his brow: he's found something odd
Bob
You better look at this
- Milo checks Lisa's oil for her
Do we post it on the Net
There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already
Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein
- Shrot stands over Len's shoulder
Could it be a glitch
Something the construction workers caused
Unlikely
All 14 cameras are frozen
Do we call Randy and Phil
Tell 'em there may have been a break-in
Not yet
'Love to bust my ass cause 'm not in frigging Mensa
(walks to the window) swear to God, it's that kid Milo, told 'em so in the first place, but they didn't even wanna hear about it
(turns to Len) Let's run a printout on card entries
- Milo shows Lisa the oil stick
She nods
The mainstream media
, or a newsmagazine
Right
But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates
Have to be careful who we pick
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership
But not on our own computers
Not even at home
Certainly not at my happy home
He slams the hood
- Shrot and Len watch a laser printer, as it spits out line after line after line of swipe card entries
: spits out code
We are: '  - Milo watches new Skywire code emerge from his printer
Gary is in the doorway behind him: watching Milo, scrutin- izing him
Sensing someone, Milo turns and looks
Gary, hi
You look a little tired
'm okay
It's going well
'Have a look
Sure
Gary takes the page
As he reads it over: Why did you move around so much
When you were a kid
My dad was a compulsive gambler
Only he didn't think he was
That applied to guys who didn't have a "system
" "Losers," who played games of chance
He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it
No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech
And you'd better not point out the obvious
(he shrugs) His creditors would catch up to him
Loan sharks or whatever
He'd wake us in the middle of the night
Off we'd go, again
What would you tell the kids
At your new school
You had to come up with a good story, right
Milo thinks: he's testing me
No
just went deeper into the machine
Preferred being the geek to having to explain
Lying would've been worse
Worse
Cause he was a liar
And  hated him
(mimicking a voice) "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world
" The more he mocked me the deeper  went
Cause if being savvy meant being like him -- (he shrugs) Guess that's why 'm kind of clueless, even now
Didn't cultivate my conniving side
'Not sure  even have one
Don't be so hard on yourself
With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em  bet
Gary smiles
There's no way to read it
- Establish the humble building, in a Park
- Lisa and Milo sit together in front of a monitor
Kid does his homework on a computer at the next table
Milo shakes his head, as he scrolls
He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives
Getting ready for Skywire
(she's thinking) What about "60 Minutes
" Yeah, they dig stuff like this
(he types, then reads) " News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001
" But still, you can't say  wouldn't love to break something like -- (he's shaking his head) Say there's just one "mole" working there, like Barton at the
How do we know he's not the guy we've contacted
Or she
Or the guy she works for
At the next table, she notices a Lady reading Time
Time
(types, reads) Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device
That also takes out
(scrolling & scrolling) " joins Outpost in new venture," which means  is out
"Disney joins Outpost,"  is out
"Outpost and Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out
Any of these places could have a mole
Or all of 'em
(still scrolling) It's like a a continuous loop
We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed
But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in
Shhh
Sorry
Milo
She's thought of something
He's watching the nerdy Kid, smiling sadly, perhaps identifying with him
How close are you
What
He's got 12 satellites up
He's got dishes on top of 21
He's building this -- (gestures at the screen) mega-network for Skywire
Let's use it
Move in on Milo as he thinks it over with a mixture of excitement and skepticism
/ - Milo and Lisa walk in the park outside the library, thinking it through
We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch
'd have to write in an aglet
what
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you
You don't ask for 'em, they just appear
'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house
And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away
But they'd still get the idea, right
You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop
Maybe some audio, too
To tie it all in to Gary
How long would that take you
It's a standard
Once 've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work
Gary knows 'm close on Skywire
We have to do this fast
Before they kill somebody else, too
(a new wrinkle) Oh, man
'd have to get into Gary's house
To get the satellite positions
You mean -- break in
don't know -- And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet
You said the place isn't finished
The complications pile up
They walk
They think
'll go look
(when he looks dubious) They'll just have a few more pictures of me snooping around
They come to a fountain and balustrade at the edge of the park, stop walking
(looks at her) Why were you so careless
thought the worst they would do is fire me
Who knew they took termination so literally
Gallows humor
What a game girl
He's nuts about her
Why were you snooping in my office
Oh
(she gets bashful) liked you
was checking you out
He kisses her
There are no constraints now, there's no "adulterous" guilt: they kiss with a passion deferred
'  - Slow push-in on the phone on Milo's desk: it's ringing
'  - Alice is calling him
Her face hardens, she hangs up
- As we pan the Best Western decor (in semi-darkness): (
) 'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are
(
) 'Cause their apartments might be bugged
Milo grins
He & Lisa lie in bed
told Teddy about you
What'd he say
" beautiful geek
What're the chances
" She smiles, rather bashfully
felt guilty
'Cause  "owed so much" to Alice
But even then  was starting to wonder
Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you
If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you
You grow older but you don't grow up
You turn into -- into -- Gary
It's painful for him: losing a second father
Larry used to say how the guys who wrote the first cool operating systems, like the  guys at Berkeley
They just gave it away
They figured it was human knowledge, it belonged to the world, like Shakespeare or aspirin
'Know what 'm gonna do after we broadcast the incriminating stuff
Air the Skywire code
Then nobody can have a monopoly
& '  - Alice is in bed
In the darkness, Milo comes in as quietly as possible
But she switches on the bedside lamp
Where were you
(holding his gaze) You know you can't keep anything from me
Okay, yeah
did something naughty
There's this amazing Comix store in Seattle
(is she buying it
) To tell you the truth,  did it once or twice at Stanford
'Guess  can't keep anything from you
Of course she buys it: it's in the file
(she smiles) won't turn you in
- Shrot and Len go over the print-out of the card entries
Every entry was authorized
Keep looking
What're we looking for
Any irregularity in the pattern
& '  - Morning  is on in the kitchen
Seattle station airs a puff piece about a party at Gary's house: people in formal clothes (including Gary & his Wife) hold drinks and eat canapes on the terrace over Lake Washington
(Gary's haircut is different: it's file footage
) Last years' party-goers pledged over $2 million to the Museum; this year's event promises to raise even more
Lured in part by the chance to see the stunning Boyd house
Alice, grinding coffee, isn't paying attention
Milo is
Look at this
What
Why doesn't he ask us to his party
He's never even met you
He has thousands of employees, Milo -- It's for the Museum
He knows you're a painter
If anybody should be invited -- Milo -- know you think 'm too attached to him, but still
am close to Gary
And you're the most meaningful person in my life
(he gets up) 'm going back to the Comix place, why should  be killing myself
Milo, you -- But he's out the door
She's not entirely displeased by such a dramatic demonstration of his loyalty to her
21 - Close on a satellite dish
We pan from the base of the dish to the wiring: a cable is fused to a component box
Lisa is on the scaffolding, having climbed it brazenly, in broad daylight
She holds a small metal box with a meter and two clamps
She applies the clamps to the base of the cable
The needle on the meter dances
Hey
Get down here
She was expecting to be busted
Still, she's scared
'   - Catholic school on a wooded lane
Schoolgirls in uniform play on the swings and hopscotch courts
-  ' Milo types madly on a four-year-old
It takes him a moment to notice
This is a lifesaver
My  crashed just before finals
None of us knows how to use it
'm thinking of taking a course
(she wants to look) May
Sure
With her, we see the complex lines of code
Forget it
- Lisa sits with Bob Shrot
She's unfolding a page of sketch paper
needed t'see it up close for a graphic
The outpost with a dish on top
climbed up there to get it right
She hands him an unfinished rendering of the dish
He looks at her, at the drawing, at her again
She's scared, but tries to hide it
(hands back the drawing) Next time you ask
Relieved, she gets up
The meter tumbles to the floor, thud
She goes white
But when she looks up, she sees Shrot didn't see it: Len is standing in the inner door, waving a printout
'Might of found something
Lisa grabs up the meter as Shrot joins Len
As she goes out, she hears: Delbert seems to enter #21 twice
Without leaving the first time
Let's get him in here
- Milo looks up as his train comes into a station
Lisa enters the car, carrying a stack of comix
He stands, they kiss, he takes the comix
Great
knocked off the aglet, as soon as  get a passable version of Skywire we're there
The dishes are juiced up, too
Thank God
Milo
Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21
was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts
(confused) They know  broke in
Alice helped me
(figuring it out) Shrot's not one of them
He's blundering into this on his own
He doesn't know about the Day Care
Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part
No cameras, the  doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about
You know the best place to hide a leaf
Yeah, that's old, in a tree
Oh
Milo
What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four
And tells them about it
They look at each other: the consequences of this discovery would be deadly
20  - busy lunch hour
Milo is eating with some other Programmers, including Desi
There's a stir of excitement in the room
Gary comes straight to Milo's table; all conversation instantly drops out
Milo
Milo stands
Gary hands him a heavy vellum invitation
'm giving a benefit for the art museum Thursday night
Thought you'd like to bring Alice
Everybody at the table is listening
That's great
Thanks
(as he goes) 'Sorry about the late notice
Milo sits down
Everybody's looking at him
"Sorry about the late notice
" - Delbert is seated across from Shrot and Len
Shrot holds the printout
Why did you enter #21 twice
Huh
Shrot hands Delbert the printout
Delbert looks at it: dense with coded entries
He stares at it
This thing's screwed-up
Look here
(shows it to them) 'Shows me going into the Day Care that night
never been in the Day Care
Shrot narrows his eyes
- Milo sits with Lisa as she brings up the graphic interface she's designed for the Skywire broadcast
It's an Outpost desktop, with recognizable logos, fonts, etc
One window'll be obits  downloaded, based on the scenarios you described
The other windows'll accommodate the surveillance stuff you told me about
The idea is, this works with anything, since we can't edit
He nods
[It's not necessary for us to understand what she's saying, just so Milo does
] She holds up an audio copy of Gary's book, The Next Highway
Same with the excerpts 'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described
Perfect
(something preys on his mind) How am  gonna get away from the party long enough to -- You could always say you have to go the bathroom
That's lame, isn't it
You'll come up with something
He already looks nervous
We begin to hear live music
'  - The music echoes from inside
Push past a line of cars and limousines in the lit-up drive, Milo's car at the head of it
Milo and Alice get out
As they go inside, she pulls a tag from the sleeve of his just-bought dinner jacket
'  -   - As Milo and Alice enter, he sees a Balthus painting re- digitize to a Mondrian
They called the house to ask who's your favorite painter
Alice smiles, Milo forces a smile: it'll be even harder to sneak away, now
They pass a doorway where a Houseman stands, to keep guests from entering residential rooms (the ones Milo must pass through to get to Gary's workroom)
Guy in a pretentiously hip tux tries to peek in
Sorry, Sir, this part of the residence is restricted
Milo looks a little more tense
- The room is full of people
long windowed wall has been opened onto a lakeside terrace, where more Guests drink and chat, and an orchestra plays
giant Mondrian digitizes on the wall: the world's largest card
Milo sinks a little more
Across the room, Gary, his Wife (a blandly pretty blond) and two Men are grouped around a Monet set on an antique easel (thus clearly the real thing; Mrs
Boyd has prevailed
) Gary notices the giant digital Mondrian
takes two flutes of champagnes off a tray
He hands one to Alice as Gary et
al
approach
Alice, 'm Gary
This is my wife, Clarissa
(handshakes, etc
) Milo, this is Barry Linder, who's visiting from Hollywood
is a short, tan man of 50
hate being the Hollywood guy
It's so limiting
Meet my friend, Ricky
is 25-years-old; he looks like a Polo model
Hi, guys
Barry's studio's gonna help fill the Skywire pipeline, thought you guys should meet
(his mind elsewhere) Cool
: the orchestra, playing
: a group of   chatting
He's a sweetheart
He gave 10,000 's to the Library Association
All 10,000 of which will be signed onto his browser, no doubt
And so what
Wait'll all the books are on-line
And so what
: Milo, Alice, Gary, Barry Linder, Clarissa, Ricky
Milo looks utterly preoccupied
The merchandising implications are epic
kid's watching the movie, he points and clicks at the laser blaster -- before the reel's even over he's ordered the toy
But,  mean -- Devil's Advocate -- won't that influence the content
Won't the artists complain
The directors or writers or whoever
Artists
Darling, the only art left in America is business
You're in Picasso's house
Gary smiles as everyone toasts him, except Milo; he hasn't heard any of it
Where's the bathroom
The irreverence
Laughter
as he wends his way through laughing, chatting Guests, dread and determination on his face
He moves away from us, enters the speaks to the Houseman who guards the residential rooms
You'll have to use one over there
He indicates an area on Milo's side of the door
There's like eight women waiting in line
They take forever
(winces: painful bladder) Please
Right here
He points to a door immediately behind him
As the Houseman watches, Milo goes into the He stands there a moment, breathes deeply
He cracks open the door
The Houseman is turning away another Guest; Milo makes his move
-  - Looking over his shoulder, Milo hurries to a door at the far end of the room, silently cursing the Mondrian that inevitably appears
The Houseman looks over his shoulder, sees the closed bathroom door, assumes Milo's still inside
- Gary chats with his guests
Alice looks up at the digital art, now a Bosch again
'  -   - Milo walks fast
As he passes from one room to next, he sees a Mondrian: he's been in this room
All the austere, tastefully decorated rooms are blending together
He stands in the center of the room making quarter turns
Through each of four (open) doorways he sees a perfectly- appointed "den," the ultimate expression of bland, rich, professionally-decorated taste
He's lost
He starts into one room -- backs up -- goes into another
- The Houseman looks over his shoulder again
He sees the Mondrian and, in the room beyond that, another Mondrian
He moves to the bathroom door, knocks on it
Opens it
He pulls a sleek walkie-talkie from his jacket
- Milo, still lost, is getting frantic
He doubles back, cuts toward another wing of the house
Through an open doorway he sees: young, chillingly calm , watching him
The Baby fusses in her arms
Milo smiles, keeps moving
'  -   - Second Houseman follows the trail of Mondrians
He sees Mondrians in two different directions
He hesitates, picks a direction, keeps moving
- The first Houseman moves through the Guests, toward Gary
'  - Milo has finally made it
Sitting at Gary's work station, he slips a - into the
It floods with text
The music echoes from far off
The entire wall behind him is filled with a Mondrian
- As Linder chats, the first Houseman sidles up to Gary, whispers in his ear
We see Gary smile, excuse himself
He and Alice share a look as he moves off
We go with Gary
His smiles fades instantly
He pushes through Guests, who thank him for hosting such a brilliant "do;" he hardly hears them
'  - Milo writes frantically on his tiny pad, copying from the screen: - 77 Degrees 03 Minutes 58 Seconds East - 38 Degrees 55 Minutes 14 Seconds South - 426 He flips the page, begins entering the fixes for the next satellite
Thinking he's heard something, he looks up
Nobody's there
- The Second Houseman turns in several directions, confused by the trail of Mondrians
Passing into the next room, he runs into a Third Houseman, also confused
Each follows a different Mondrian, in a different room
'  -   - Unlike the Housemen, Gary doesn't follow the paintings
He moves swiftly, seems to know where Milo is
'  - Milo still working
- Alice looks up at the digital painting: still a Bosch
Her face sets grimly
'  - Milo clicks, closing the window
Concentrating, he doesn't see what we see on the wall behind him: the Mondrian drains away
And the wall fills up with the hellish Bosch triptych
After a moment, Milo senses something
Gary stands in the doorway
Watching him
Milo doesn't breathe
Gary crosses the room, eyes locked with Milo's
Gary comes behind Milo
He reads the screen
It's filled with text, whatever Milo loaded in when he sat down
(reading the screen) "Dear Lisa
've enjoyed working with you
'd be lying if  didn't say  find you attractive
But in my heart  know that Alice
" (he looks up) You left my party to send -mail
couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons
Gary stares at Milo
He looks skeptical
The party music floats in from afar as the moment stretches
You could've handwritten it
'm not much good at handwriting
Or parties
Oh, that's right
You're "clueless
" This hangs there
Gary, 'm sorry if  was rude -- The Second Houseman sticks his head in
Everything , Mr
Boyd
No problem
(when he's gone) Is there
Gary,  -- You see what's hanging on the wall
He looks over
Milo looks over
Among the framed commendations, awards, degrees we see Milo's childhood program, written on Outpost 1
0
Gary has had it framed
Milo absorbs it
Even now, he feels something for Gary
hope you know what you mean to me
Not just because of what you're doing
Because of who you are
do know, Gary
feel the same way
thought  was coming here for a job
But it's meant a lot more
Milo smiles almost tenderly
He doesn't know if Gary buys it
Perhaps if he could see Gary's eyes
But they're obscured by Bosch's writhing bodies, reflected on his eyeglasses
Gary moves away from Milo, he stands over the table with the art books, vaguely looks through one
When will you have a Beta version
Milo wonders: does he know
He picks his words carefully
'm pretty close
But when  wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer
You know what it's like, writing software
do know
You focus on the big problem
But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down
Something gets destroyed
At first it's upsetting
You feel you've lost control
Gary puts down the book
Something in his tone draws Milo
So you have to remind yourself: it's just the process
Something's always lost along the way to anything worthwhile
Some little bug, some glitch
'Can't get bogged down in that, you're doing something other people could never do
They lack the imagination, the brain, the nerve
Let them fret about every unforeseen consequence
You have to solve the problem
That's who you are
Is this a confession
plea for understanding
Or just a pep-talk to keep Milo focused on Skywire
/ /'  - In the car, Milo and Alice pull away from the lights and limos in icy silence
Several beats
Are you gonna tell me where you went
went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office
You know
Just to hold it again
He looks at her
She stares ahead, out the windshield
Are you having an affair, Milo
He'd better have his story straight with Gary and Alice
No
No
sent an -mail to somebody, just now
To tell her how  feel about you
(looks at her) You know 'm clueless, without you
You know  -- (fighting tears) Just shut up
Or is she faking it
Has he lost the trust of all of them
He's afraid, now
- Move in on the building, past Kids playing in the yard
-   - We hear the children's shouts
Short, with a fingerprint kit, is dusting the keyboards
Len stands over him
Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do
(looking around, perplexed) What would Milo want in here, anyway
They know
'Just they don't trust me with it
So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later
- By the balustrade, in the dimness, Milo stands with Lisa
Does he know you know
He suspects  know something
think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case  do
(he breathes) We have to go in tonight
'm two hours from a Beta version
(knows she won't like it) But 've gotta go home for an hour
Why
She called to apologize
said was pulling an all-nighter
She said then come home just to say Hi
Which always do when we fight, it's suspicious if  don't
Please don't go
At this point the worst thing  could do is anything out of the ordinary
She looks at him, worried, then takes a disk out of her backpack
Here's the interface
He takes it
They kiss
She watches him go, worried
/
'  - As Milo comes up the path, he sees Alice in the kitchen
He opens the front door, steps in
She comes from the kitchen in an apron, wiping her hands
The apron is spattered, her hair is askew
'm a mess
got this Hunan cookbook, since we're always afraid for you to eat in Chinese restaurants
've been mincing things into teeny-tiny pieces all afternoon
He smiles to hide his terror
Is she killing him now
Or just testing his reaction
Or is it a sincere overture
Great
Look at me
'm gonna change
When she turns away, we see the fear on his face
- Alice pulls into a dress
- Milo, at the stove, sniffs at the food that simmers in a wok
He grabs a a spoon, examines it; but it's minced too fine to discern one ingredient from another
Alice pulls her hair back with a ribbon
Milo churns the garbage in the wastebasket, reads the label on a jar, the label on a can
Alice applies blush-on
Milo goes through the spice cabinet
- Milo paces
He stops when she comes from the bedroom
(he smiles) You look beautiful
Yeah
Give me a goodbye kiss
What
know you
You're gonna run back to work right after dinner
want my kiss now
Either she's the most cold-blooded woman in the world, or
He takes her in his arms, kisses her long and hard -- as if his life depended on it
When he releases her, she pretends to swoon
She backs toward the kitchen
Be right back
- Camera is positioned on the counter, just behind the big bowl as Alice spoons the food into it
She sprinkles on some final ingredient, also minced
- Milo's fingers drum the table top
- Alice picks up the dish
We don't see her face
-  -  (' ) We hold the dish out in front of us
The food shines in the light, a poisonous yellow gleam
We move from kitchen to dining room, slowly, deliberately
Milo comes into view beyond the dish, wearing a forced smile
We come all the way to the table with the dish, where Alice sets it down
She sits
Milo, still vamping, pours wine
He picks up his fork
Stares at it
Milo
His mind churns furiously
Milo
Don't we have any chopsticks
Oh, right
Hold on
When she's gone, he flips his left arm over and drags the tines of his fork against it, making score-marks, like those used by allergists to test for sensitivity
He dabs the sauce onto the tracks, wipes it clean
He stares at it
- Alice roots through ladles, bottle openers, cheese graters, spatulas
At the bottom of the drawer, she finds two pairs of take-out chopsticks, wrapped in white paper
- Milo looks from his watch to his arm -- no reaction yet
(under his breath) One more minute
But here's Alice
She slips into her seat
Here we go
Great
He unwraps the chopsticks rather slowly
wanna savor this
It's gonna get cold
Right
Wait
toast
You're just afraid to eat it
She smiles, picks up her glass
To the artist
They toast
She sips her wine
He sips his
He wants desperately to glance at his inner arm once more
But she's watching him, waiting for him to eat
He picks up the chopsticks, gathers up a tiny bite
She watches keenly
He brings the food to his mouth, passes it between his lips, swallows
He closes his eyes, ostensibly to savor the food, in fact bracing for a paroxysm
She watches him expectantly -- either for his verdict on the food, or for the first fatal spasm
(his voice cracks) It's great
It's great
She grins
She takes a bite
The moment she looks away, he turns over his arm to get a look, face full of fear
The tracks are still flat, there's no redness
He shovels a large bite into his mouth, ecstatic to be alive
Then another bite, greedy with life
- Shrot and Len are in a high-tech office
On a monitor, we see a blown-up image of a fingerprint taken from Milo's keyboard; Milo's name is printed under it
In a second window, other fingerprints flash by: thousands of prints lifted off keyboards in the Day Care
Shrot waits for a match to click in
'  - Milo scrolls his Skywire code, concentrating intensely
Till he feels some stickiness on his thumb and forefinger
He rubs them together, peers at his keys
Dolly-zoom in on a trace of fingerprint powder
Fear seizes Milo
He ejects his the Skywire  -- it is a bright silver color, with a Skywire logo on it -- slips it in an equally distinct silver () jewel-case
20  - Milo smiles at Desi as he moves up the hall
He almost bumps into Gary's Secretary
Milo, hi
How was the party
Great
Great
Thanks for asking
He continues up the hall
He ducks into the service hall
- Shrot watches as The computer produces an alarm-like buzzing
The second window locks onto the matching print
The prints flash in unison, garishly confirming the match
/ - Milo races along the tunnel that leads from #20 to the Day Care
- Shrot punches a number on the phone
You calling Phil and Randy
'm calling Gary
/   - Milo climbs the stairs, fumbles with the swipecard, enters the Day Care
- Len is at the console
On a security monitor, he has called- up video from a moment ago: Milo hurrying up the hall, almost running into Gary's Secretary
Shrot has an eye on the video as he speaks on the phone
He's left his office, we think he's gone back to the Day Care for some reason
Can you tell me why, Gary
(he listens) Whatever you say
(hangs up angrily) Wants to consult with Phil
Was it Phil's idea to run the fingerprints
Shrot straps on his service revolver as he heads out
Come with me
(trying to catch up) Where we going
-   - Milo is under the table, detaching one of the the black plastic data towers that contain the "primers," stored surveillance material, etc
'  - Phil hangs up the phone
He turns to Randy, who is with the two men: the blond , the pale-eyed
He's in the Day Care
- Milo carefully detaches a second data tower
20 - Shrot and Len hurry out of the building, toward the Day Care across the quad
Len is ill-at-ease: Bob, 'm a programmer, not a cop
In his haste, Shrot doesn't even hear him
20  - Gunther, Riman & Randy head down the service hallway, en route to the bomb shelter stairs
- Milo, lugging one bulky black data tower under each arm (wondering if he should just ditch one) gets as far as the main, colorfully-carpeted room -- Shrot is there, gun drawn
Len stands just behind
What are you doing
You're better off not knowing
Shrot thinks he's being mocked, as usual
What're you doing
Milo sets down one of the towers
They're surveilling programmers from in here
They steal their code
Sometimes --  know this sounds insane -- sometimes they kill one
Shrot looks skeptical
They let me break into 21
'Cause there's nothing in there
You know they've been keeping things from you
'Getting in the way when you try t'do your job
That's why you never told 'em your suspicions about me
Right
Shrot doesn't deny it
If you had 'd be dead now
Milo's sincerity is striking
Shrot cogitates
You've been following your gut all along
Please don't stop now
- Gunther, Riman and Randy climb the metal stairs, turn at a landing, climb some more
When they get to the next landing, Riman opens the door
They enter - Hearing voices inside, Gunther draws a gun; they move forward stealthfully
They enter the - What's going on here
Randy sees: Shrot and Len
Who're these guys
Where is he
We're too late
Take a look
He shines his light under the table, where the towers have been detached
What's in here worth taking, anyway
- Milo hurries away from the Day Care
He has just one data tower, now, so he can move faster
- Randy starts to push past Shrot -- He must be out there still -- He gets to the front room, where the jettisoned data tower still sits (but he doesn't see it)
(calling after) Forget about it
His car's not in the lot, he's gone
Shrot watches anxiously to see if he's stopped Randy
-   - Milo moves low among the high-priced cars, lugging the tower
He gets to his Deux Chevaux, opens the trunk -- Hey
Milo turns
It's Desi, again
Wanna get a cheeseburger or something
Maybe another time
As calmly as possible, he stows the tower, slams the trunk, gets in the car
-   - Randy hangs up the phone
(to Shrot & Len) Fellas, 'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now
Wait a second
'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place
We're all grateful for that
Really
Go out the way you came in
Reluctantly, Shrot & Len head out toward the front room
/ ' / - Milo is on the phone, he drives as fast as one can in his car
Meet me at the other location
(
) Tell me you're not calling on your car phone
-   - Randy, Riman & Gunther have turned the Day Care into a surveillance post
They hear Milo & Lisa's conversation on speakers
(
) They know,  had no choice
Get out of the house now
Do you have a laptop
'  - (  ) It's three years old, it -- '  - (  ) Bring it to the other location
But you said the other -- He rings off
He reads something off a business card
'  - Scrambling, Lisa grabs her old laptop, finds her keys
'  - '  - Phil's on the phone
Yeah, alright
(hangs up, briefs Gary) He's off campus, he's taken some surveillance data with him
Gary's eyes narrow
She's bringing her laptop, it's wired
Second she boots up, we're on 'em
/
/'  -   - Milo reads the address off the business card, which has a satellite dish as its logo
(He holds it in front of him
) When he brings down the card, it reveals a real-life satellite dish through the windshield
As the car pulls up by a low cinderblock building, we read a sign that says  -
-   - Milo rushes in, lugging the tower
There's a linoleum floor, framed one-sheets for tacky public access shows (Yoga, blow- dried Evangelist, Nude Talk Show)
Behind the reception desk sits a beefy -- with an earring
-- Help you
Brian here
Brian Bissel
-- (picks up the phone) Who wants to see him
/
' / - Lisa drives fast, checking her rear-view-mirror to make sure she's not being followed
Pan to the seat next to her: her laptop lies on the passenger seat
- monitor shows a green interface with yellow coordinates (like an air traffic controllers' screen)
Randy sits at the keyboard in front of it, phone cradled on shoulder
(into the phone) Nothing
They haven't booted-up yet
- Milo speaks to Brian
This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software
You'd be my partner
You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show
Brian
You wanna be a big deal, don't you
That's your dream in life
Brian is examining the data tower
He touches the Outpost logo branded into it, rather reverently
Lisa comes in, laptop slung over her arm
Will  get to work for Outpost
No
But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this
We're gonna bring down Outpost
What
What'd they ever do for you
Brian's thinking it over
He shrugs
Okay
Great
Great
We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door -- What
(to the Rent-a-Guard) Wanna be a part of history
-- Not really
(digging in his pocket) Well -- would you like to pick up an extra -- 232 dollars
'  - Gary is pacing
(on the phone) Nothing yet, Gary
-   - The Rent-a-Guard drags a file cabinet in front of the door, where he has already dragged the couch, some chairs, a garbage can, two lamps
() -  - Three 's of various sizes and wood veneers are turned on: one to  ("") one to  ("48 Hours") one to (toothpaste commercial)
On an in-house monitor a leathery Woman in a leotard does yoga
Lisa is cabling her laptop into the station's computer
Brian boots it up: it runs the satellite
Milo cables the data tower into the laptop
Cables go in every which direction: the whole set-up has a distinctly gerry-rigged look
Go tight on the laptop power switch
Lisa toggles it on
- The yellow coordinates start blinking on
Randy sits at a console
(into the phone) We've got a fix on 'em
(typing) 218 North Jericho Road
Gunther and Riman grab holstered guns, race out
Randy types some more, speaks into the phone: Public access  station
'  - Phil hangs up, blows a sigh of relief
He's taken it to the public access station
Phil sags gratefully into a chair
only to see Gary plow past him
At his workstation Gary types, mutters: That's what he was doing in here
The Bosch wall screen fills up with a dark blue background, longitude and latitude lines
Gary
Gary throws a printed spiral notebook at him
Help me change the Skywire settings
Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate
Gary, don't worry, we -- Just do what 'm asking
Gary hits a switch
wood panel slides into the wall, revealing a bank of four 's
/ - Gunther and Riman speed toward the station
-  - Milo slips his disk in the laptop
Lisa cables the video tower to the laptop
You're interfaced with our dish
(to Lisa) Gimme the coordinates
Lisa reads from Milo's little pad
Longitude 77 degrees, 03 minutes, 58 seconds East
Milo types on the laptop
Latitude 38 degrees, 55 minutes, 14 seconds South
'  - Phil reads to Gary as he types
19 seconds South
Altitude 431 Miles
- We see the Earth far below
The Skywire Satellite orbits majestically into frame, shifts five degrees to the left
-  - Milo hits enter
Milo, Lisa, Brian, shift their collective gaze to the three funky  sets
"" plays, uninterrupted, Dan Rather, Diane Sawyer on , the Yoga lady, the audio of all four blending in a chaotic low melange that adds to the tension (particularly the frantic medical emergency on "")
Is it your software
Is it your dish
Maybe it's the satellite
(he thinks) Let's try #2
'  - Okay, #2
Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes -- - Gunther and Riman squeal into the station parking lot

Milo is typing in coordinates
They're already here
My laptop must be wired
(anxiously) Milo

Milo hits enter

Damn

-  - Gunther and Riman tear through the barricade the Rent--Cop has erected with ruthless precision
- Milo cogitates while Lisa reviews the satellite coordinates -- (to Brian) You checked your connections
(to Milo) Yes
Should you reboot
Milo is scrolling the software, trying to figure out which of a 1,000 possible glitches is getting in the way
He knows
What
He's been altering the coordinates since we logged on
He's a step ahead
Let's jump to #12
'  - Ready for number three
Let's go
Longitude 109 -- Wait
He knows
What
'Knows 'm altering the coordinates
Let's jump to #12
Gary
Just do it
-   - The Rent--Guard drags furniture, props, lights, in front of the entrance to the satellite room
-  - Gunther and Riman have created an opening in the barricade
They step through it
They hear the racket the Rent-a-Guard is making upstairs
They head that way
/  - The Rent--Guard is holding a lightstand as they ascend, guns drawn
Step aside
We won't hurt you
Riman takes the lightstand from him
The Rent-a-Guard puts his hands up, sidles across the hallway as they tear into the barricade
- Lisa reads to Milo
Latitude 47 degrees
Wait a second
He knows  know
What
He's working backwards, too
(to Lisa) Let's do number five
Longitude 66
Milo types
- Gunther and Riman rip down the barricade, reach the door
They whip it open, guns drawn
They see: An empty supply room
[The barricade was a decoy
] - The Rent--Guard has joined Milo et al in here
He tries to slide a heavy shelf in front of the door, but it's not yet in place
Lisa has dialed 911
She's scared
Come now
They've got guns
, we can hear Gunther and Riman pounding at the door
(
) Open the door, Milo
(to Milo) You there yet
(typing) One more second
He hits enter
The door is kicked open
Gunther & Riman enter, Gunther with a gun, Riman still carrying the light stand
He immediately bashes the  computer with it
Lisa looks devastated
Hey, hey, relax, relax
He holds up the computer cable, to show Riman it was never plugged in, anyway
Oh my God
(to Gunther) Should  call Phil
Or do you
Gunther knits his brow
He notices Milo: still staring at the  screens
Milo
Wake up
Our regular programming will not be preempted tonight
Milo's gaze stays fixed to the screens
Riman grabs him by the shirt
But Gunther's concerned by Milo's behavior: (staring at Milo) Wait
As Milo watches the screens, a pixilated, ghostly image begins to appear on all of them: the animated Skywire logo (lightning strike, etc
)
Brian lurches across to the laptop, ejects the -
It's beige-colored, says Outpost Word
When did you know
(still watching the screens) You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects
Milo
Who's got Skywire
'  - Gary and Phil watch as the Skywire logo gets steadily stronger on Gary's 's
Phil is confounded: If Milo didn't launch Skywire, who did
We hear a low steady hum
: plugged into a dusty wall-port that doesn't even have a plate on it
Panning along the cable, we widen to show: (#21) - In dim construction light, not far from the Sears generator, Len sits on the concrete floor
The second data tower is patched into a laptop
The distinct silver jewelcase lies by the -rom drive
Shrot paces: Now what are we doing
don't get any of this shit
launched Skywire
Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite
: Each shows the standard Outpost desktop: Outpost logo, fonts, colors
[This is the all-purpose interface Lisa created for to Milo
]  window at the top shows a succession of Obituaries with photos Lisa has downloaded from newspapers: "Programmer Dies in Highway Crash;" "Programmer Among Cult Suicides;" "Programmer Victim of Racial Killing," etc
) The obituaries -- eight of them -- fade up and down in a continuous cycle
Meantime: Lower on the screen, the material from the day-care data tower appears, following the same succession we saw when Milo brought up Teddy's data, i
e
, footage of a young Programmer at college, surveillance footage of him typing away (from behind), medical records that describe his vulnerability or a crime primer that describes his scenario
Between the obits and the primers, cause and effect is (eventually) established
The crowning note is the audio, Gary in  , gleaned (by Lisa) from the audio version of his own book: ' Most of us who write software achieve our greatest work before age 30
As grow older  know how important it is to access fertile young minds
Gary watching
-   - We hear sirens grow near
Gunther watches the broadcast, still gripping his gun
(to Gunther) You know the scenario for this
This sounds ominous
Lisa wonders what it means
Milo wonders what it means
He swallows hard
'Last thing you wanna do is hurt us now
(not at all sure) Right
(to Brian) Who's seeing this
(with dread) Who isn't

- Pedestrians and motorists (with craned necks) watch the Jumbo-Tron, now the world's biggest desktop
In one window, college video of a promising Programmer, in the other, footage of a cult suicide
(Sometimes the Programmer in question is simultaneous with his obit, sometimes not, but the connection by now becomes clear)
' The first rule of the software business is: those who don't innovate are doomed to die

The cuts accelerate
In a   , Technicians flip switches, trying to bring back scheduled programming
At the , the Brokers are transfixed by what comes over the Big Board
In a   Gamblers sip their drinks as they watch it on closed-circuit horserace monitors
On a , a Crack Dealer watches on his beeper
At a , the Stones play but (tilting up) the Diamond Vision behind them plays Milo's broadcast
In an  , a wall of 's -- 200 of them -- plays grisly primer footage for Shoppers
guy takes a shiny wrapped copy of Outpost '98 from his basket, returns it to the shelf
In the Day Care Computer Room, it plays on all the monitors as Randy moves through the room with a big buzzing electro-magnetic hoop, which he runs over each tower, wiping out data
Through all the cuts, we hear Gary's narration: ' That's why we work so hard to invent or acquire great new applications
Consumers don't care where new ideas come from, just so long as they're offered at competitive prices
Isn't that what the free market's about
Sure, we like being #1, but it's pressure, too
This business is binary: you're a zero or a one

- group of Government Lawyers, working late (Chinese takeout, loosened ties) watch with a dawning sense of unbelievable good luck
'Guess we should wake the Attorney General
:    - Teddy Chin's recruitment file is in one window, the hate crime footage is in another
' 've been called "aggressive" but to me, that's really a compliment
:   - Larry watches with his start-up partners
His eyes close: it hurts to see Teddy, again
' Look at all the jobs and technologies my "aggression" has created

The broadcast plays,

) Lyle
Phone for you
She comes in
No Barton
The front door is wide open, the is still on
' We really are a family here at Outpost
& '  -  - Paintings are gone from the wall, clothes flung around
Move in on a note pinned to the pillow, as the  plays
' think that's why outsiders sometimes sees us as "cultish" or "secretive
" Milo, It wasn't so bad, really
"Alice" - High wide shot: sirens scream as unmarked sedans and squadcars squeal into the sanctified parking lot
' Is loyalty and group spirit somehow "sinister" nowadays
'  - Open on Gary's  monitors, then pan into the room
Phil has departed; the Outpost Lawyers have taken his place
The "murder" stuff is all innuendo: bad , legally null
'Could probably be spun as Urban Legend
There is a case for corporate espionage, but if you cop a plea, you'll get a slap -- Cop a plea
'm confused, Ted
You think  knew about this
The Lawyers suppress their opinion
'm running the company, fighting the , raising a family
Randy and Phil obviously overreacted
To this endless, antitrust witchhunt
(get real) The government's gonna offer 'em a helluva deal to tie you into this
Whether you knew about it or not
2 Randy, Phil and whoever else knew about it
That won't be a problem

(
) As for , Skywire'll take care of all that
onto a tarmac
private jet sits lit up, waiting
'  - The world's seen it now
They know it's gonna dominate the convergence market even beyond how Outpost '98 dominates the desktop
- 35,000
- Continuous dolly past: Gunther, as he takes a Chivas from the Stewardess; Lyle Barton who slips on his headset; Alice, sorting through video casettes; Randy & Phil, playing gin rummy; Brian, eating a hamburger
Meantime: (
) Go after us, you give foreign competitors a shot at the platform that'll hold sway for 30 years: you threaten not just our chip and partners like when you came after the browser
'  - You threaten  networks, phone companies, catalog outlets, publishing houses, movie studios, travel agents, airlines, stock brokerages -- you sabotage the whole economy
Talk about undermining innovation
2 (he's writing on a legal pad) Easy to spin, old as the hills: What's good for Outpost is good for America
He hands the pad to Gary
-   - Milo watches the screens, anxiously
Come on, Bob
Load in the other disk
'  - Gary is reading from the Lawyer's pad
" had no knowledge of these activities, but  have to ask myself if the competitive environment encouraged in some small way contributed --" Gary
Gary looks up
The Lawyer nods soberly at the 's
In one window, the Skywire code scrolls slowly past
In the other, it says: "Here's the code for the operating system that made this braodcast possible
Take it
Use it
Make the new convergence technologies as free as the Web
" Under the windows, these words scroll continuously: Watching, Gary knits his brow: he looks wounded
- In the lab that began the montage, move past rows of Students scribbling madly as the code unfolds, or saving it to their hard drives
Off-screen, a Student says, "Well, the genie's out of that bottle
" : ( ) The Board ousted Gary Boyd as Chairman, they're assisting the in the breakup of Outpost into divisions
: - The   chats with
( ) That's gotta kill him, right
( ) Outpost was his baby, sure
On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites
Personally
( ) Outpost doesn't own em
We are: - Larry Lindholm sits on a couch watching
are carrying out computer equipment all around him
He tries to ignore them
( ) Conglomerates're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites
They'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line
That'd change with a criminal indictment
There's no hard evidence he knew about this
Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished
( ) Isn't there a stigma
Bankrolling this guy
( ) Stigma
Larry
60 billion buys you some slack in this world
( ) And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away
They're calling him the digital Robin Hood
( ) Milo
Surprised he's not your guest
( ) We tried
( ) You better believe everybody's trying to sign him up
As Larry (King) chuckles, Larry (Lindholm) looks up
Milo and Lisa wear backpacks
As Milo sluffs his off: Larry, Lisa
Larry switches off the  as he comes to his feet
Mover passes by, hauling out a monitor
Larry explains: Your app kind of blew mine out of the water
(he shrugs) We'll come up with the next big thing
You wanna work -- here
Got out of my other commitment
Larry hugs Milo
Turns to Lisa: May
He hugs Lisa, too
Mover grabs Milo's backpack from the floor
Hey, wait
(when the Mover looks) Not giving everything away
The Mover sets it down, moves on
'mon
Bring your stuff
Milo grabs up his pack, the three of them head away from camera
You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay
Cool
