- '  - - Bakelite alarm clock hits 6:30
and , thirties, attractive, rumpled, reaches   to shut it off
She sits up, rubs tiredly at her face, and moves , switching on a radio as she goes
Music fills the air
- She throws water on her face as the music continues
She looks at herself in the mirror as the light flickers overhead
She hits the wall offhandedly, something she does every day
The flickering stops
With a last look at the mirror, she smoothes back her hair and exits, switching off the light
'  - Dressed now, she flicks on the overhead light is nine years old, with light brown hair, though we don't see much of it or him, he's entangled in the sheets
It's important that we don't see him too clearly in most of the following scenes, but without drawing attention to that aspect
Walter
time for school, honey
She sits on the edge of the bed, runs a hand through his hair
Just ten more minutes -- Sorry, champ

(Cont'd) You can sleep in all you want tomorrow, that's what Saturdays are for
Now hurry up or your breakfast will get cold
It's cereal, it's supposed to be cold
She smiles, kisses him on the forehead, and exits
He sits on the edge of the bed, wavers, then falls back into bed again
- street-car (known then as the Big Red) rumbles down the street in the gray light of morning, passing Ford Model 's and Hudsons and Nash four-door sedans
- - Christine sits on one of the benches, Walter's face buried in her lap, still half-asleep
She nudges him as they come to an intersection by a grade school
It's early enough that only a few other kids have arrived
We're here, sweetie
Come on
She hands him a sack lunch and follows as he slouches toward the door
She watches from the curb as he heads toward the school
Some of the teachers lounging outside nod to her as Walter approaches, so she knows they're aware that he's there
She waves, then hurriedly gets back on the street-car as it rumbles away
-   - Located on Grand Avenue downtown, the huge switchboard room is a maze of switching stations, tangles of wires and heavy wooden headsets
a roar of buzzers, bells, circuits opening and closing, and a hundred female operators speaking at once
Supervisors on skates roll up and down the narrow lanes created by the banks of switching stations, going from one operator to another as needed
Christine is one of them
She turns at the  of a bell struck twice, then rolls down the lane toward an  frantically waving a pink sheet of paper
Okay Sandy, what's the prob-- The mortified operator hands her the headset and stalks off
True Story                                       3
You deal with this one, 'm not going near it
Christine struggles on the headset
Hello
Yes, this is the supervisor, ma'am, what can  -- (checks board) Yes,  can see that you're on a party line, ma'am, what can  -- (beat) know, it's unfortunate, but people sometimes do listen in on party lines
We hope to have private lines installed by -- (beat) Well, what's he doing when you're on the phone
(beat) Are you sure
Maybe there's a problem with the phone line
He could be asthmatic, or -- (beat) Oh
No,
've never heard of anything like that before either
Guess there's a first time for everything, right
No, 'm afraid there's nothing we can do about people abusing the equipment or
themselves
'm sorry
-- She reacts to the phone being hung up hard at the other end as the floor manager,  , 30s, approaches
Everything all right
Fine, Mr
Harris
fine
just someone having a problem with a
with the connection
Tell them to take the plug and shove it in and out a few times, that'll usually do it
Unfortunately that was part of the problem
If you'll excuse me
She roller-skates off toward another operator waving another pink sheet of paper

-   - Christine sits alone, eating a bag lunch and reading a thick telephone company manual
Working hard to advance herself
Then a bell rings: time to return to work
Other employees gather up their belongings and start inside
As Christine closes the book, her bookmark falls out
As she picks it up, we see that it's a child's drawing: her and Walter (with arrows indicating who is who) on a green hill, under an orange sun
She touches the drawing and smiles as the bell rings again
She grabs her belongs and heads back inside
- Christine waits outside the school as another bell rings, announcing the end of classes
Kids run outside, Walter among them
He folds in alongside as they start down the sidewalk
Hey, sport
Hey, mom
So how was school
Okay
We learned about dinosaurs, and  got in a fight with Billy Mankowski
What happened
He hit me
Did you hit him back
(he nods) Good
Rule number one: Never start a fight, but always finish it
So why did he hit you
Because  hit him
She stops, looks at him
Wait
you hit him first
(he nods) Why
True Story                                    5
He said my dad ran off because he didn't like me
Your dad never even had a chance to meet you
so how could he not like you
Then why did he leave
Christine takes his hand, and they continue down the sidewalk
Well, the same day you were born, something else arrived
It came in the mail, in a box just slightly bigger than you
You know what was in that box
(he shakes head) Something called responsibility
Now, to some people, responsibility is fun, it's what you live your whole life for
Other people think it's the scariest thing in the world
So he ran away because he was scared of what was in the box
Yup
That's dumb
That's what  thought
She turns and crouches down in front of him
Walter,  decided a long time ago that  would always tell you the truth, that  would treat you like a grown-up
can't expect you to respect me unless  respect you
(beat) 've never lied to you
Your father leaving had nothing to do with you, and everything to do with what was in the responsibility box
Pinky-swear
True Story                                       6
Pinky-swear
She takes his pinky in hers, gives a tug
He smiles
First one to the corner store gets ice cream
He laughs and tears off
She runs after him, letting him stay ahead of her the whole way
-   - Walter is asleep on the floor, in front of the radio, which is playing the closing moments of Amos and Andy
Christine enters and turns off the radio
He stirs, looks up at her
Did  miss Amos and Andy
'm afraid so, sport
Come on now, time for bed
She picks him up and carries him up the stairs
Are we still going to the movies tomorrow
Uh-huh
hear there's a new Charlie Chaplin playing down at Grauman's, and a new serial called The Mysterious Airman
Who's that
don't know
Nobody does
That's what makes him so mysterious
Oh
Am  too heavy for you to carry
Not for years yet, Walter
Not for years
And she disappears upstairs
- Just enough to bring us into True Story                                     7
- '  - She's getting ready for the day and is almost out of the room when the phone rings
She hesitates, then picks it up
:  10, 1928 Hello
(beat) Oh, hello, Margaret
'm fine, thanks
No,  was just -- (beat) You're kidding
When did she call in sick
(checks watch) What about Myrna
know she could use the extra hours
Oh
No, it's just
promised Walter 'd take him to the movies today
There has to be somebody else
(beat) All right,
guess we can do it tomorrow
'll get there as soon as  can
But just until four, okay
See you in a bit
She hangs up
She doesn't like this, but there's no way out of it
She straightens and heads out of the room
-   - disappointed Walter sits on the couch as Christine puts things together quickly
There's a sandwich and milk in the icebox, and 've asked Mrs
Riley if her daughter can stop by in a couple of hours, just to -- can take care of myself
Of course you can
She's coming by to check on the house, not you
She stops in front of him, kneels down to eye height
Tomorrow, we'll go to the movies
Then we'll ride the Big Red down to Santa Monica and walk on the pier
How's that
That okay

(Cont'd) (he nods) Good
'll be back before it gets dark
'm not afraid of the dark
'm not afraid of anything
know you're not, honey
That's how  raised you
(kisses his head) Be good
See you in a bit
She heads out, the screen door clattering shut behind her
- She crosses the lawn and turns at the sidewalk, glancing back as Walter looks out at her from the window
She waves
He waves back
With one last look, she continues off
-   - If the place was hectic before, now it's even worse: lines buzzing, voices chattering, operators following Christine around with papers and question
We've got lines jammed from here to Ohio
he insists on talking to someone in charge
've tried everything and the console's just dead
need your signature here for a supply requisition
Christine glances up at the clock, 4:39
She's already late
But she does what's necessary
All right, get me the Omaha routing station, see if we can put the calls through their switchers
and let's get that console running
She hurries off to take care of it all, the others following
-  - on a clock which reads 5:20, then   as Christine comes out of the switchboard room, pulling on a sweater, ready to leave
as the floor manager steps out of his office

Christine
good,  was hoping to catch you
've been following your work reports, and  just want you to know that 'm very impressed
She glances down the block
The street car is approaching, but she doesn't want to piss off her boss by running off
When  first suggested hiring female supervisors, my superiors weren't big on the idea
But you've held your own as well as any of our male supervisors, and -- Thank you, Mr
Harris, but  -- Ben, please
Point is, we're looking for someone to take on a managerial position in our new Beverly Hills office
If you're interested  can -- That's great, Mr
Harris,  really appreciate the vote of confidence
Good, good
so maybe we could -- She looks up to see the streetcar right at the stop
'm sorry, but  really have to go
We'll talk on Monday
Good night
She races out to - running after the streetcar as it closes its doors
Wait
wait
hold on, just a -- But the streetcar rumbles away before she can catch it
Frustrated, she glances at her watch and sighs resignedly
- - Christine sits on the front bench, watching as the shadows lengthen, then pulls the bell
The car rumbles to a stop as she steps out onto the sidewalk
True Story                                           10
- She passes a grocery store, where a clock reads 6:15, and continues past other houses on the pleasant, green street
We  parents telling their kids to come in for dinner, radios playing music or radio dramas
Peaceful, charming
Christine smiles, turns the corner, looks to her house -- -- and it's dark, closed up
No lights on inside, no music or dramas on the radio
Dead silent
Christine pauses, then picks up her pace
No need to panic, he could be upstairs asleep, could be in the back of the house, where the lights wouldn't show
She goes to the front door
It's unlocked
She enters -- -   - It's dark, silent
She puts her purse down
Looks around
Walter
Nothing
She goes into switching on lights as she goes
Nothing
She checks the refrigerator
The sandwich she made Walter is untouched
She moves to the staircase
Walter
' She opens the door to his room
No Walter
She crosses to the sidewalk
Looks up and down the street
Walter
Honey
Time to come in
little  on a tricycle rolls past
Susie honey, have you seen Walter
Nuh-uh
The girl continues away
Christine's concerned, but she hasn't hit the panic button, not yet
She crosses the street to -- True Story                                           11
-- and rings the doorbell
The door opens and
, forties, emerges
Mrs
Riley, 'm sorry to bother you at dinnertime, but  was wondering if Walter was here
No, 'm afraid not
Do you know if Jamie was able to look in on him
Well,  mentioned it to her, but she was going to a dance with some of her friends
you know how teenagers are
Is everything all right
'm sure it's fine,  just
(beat) Thank you, Mrs
Riley
Christine heads away
Christine stops at the sidewalk in front of her house, looks up and down the street, arms folded against the growing chill
Walter
Walter
She starts walking again
Faster now
Looking around trees and porches, anywhere a nine-year-old boy might hide
She hears children playing
Laughing
She picks up her pace, homing in on the sound
She turns the corner to find three children playing, none of them Walter
She looks down the ominously empty streets
Her worry growing, she heads to the house
Faster now
Heels clicking on the hard sidewalk
- She bursts in, leaving the door open, looking around in case he came in while she was out
Nothing
She crosses to the phone, hesitates for just a , then picks up the receiver
True Story                                   12
Yes, Operator, give me the police
There's a long pause as she waits, looks out the window, then: (on phone) Lincoln Heights Division
Yes, hello, my name is Christine Collins,  live at 210 North Avenue 23
'm calling to report a missing child
it's my son, he
(on phone) How long has he been gone
'm not sure
just got home from work and
it could be since late this morning, it could be just an hour -- (on phone) Have you checked around the neighborhood
Yes, of course,  -- (on phone) Maybe he lost track of the time
No, he always stays around the house when it starts to get dark
Can you please send someone down here
(on phone) 'm sorry, but our policy is that we don't dispatch units on missing child cases for twenty-four hours
What
But that's -- (on phone) Ninety-nine times out of a hundred the kid shows up by morning
We don't have the resources to go chasing every kid who runs off with his pals and -- That's not Walter, he doesn't do that
True Story                                     13
(on phone) With all due respect, ma'am, every parent who calls us says the same thing
Please,  -- (on phone) 'm sorry, but there's nothing can do
'll take your name and information, but that's all until tomorrow morning at the earliest
- Christine walks down the street, arms wrapped around herself
(
) 'm sure he'll show up by then
They always do
She continues on, calling Walter's name as she disappears into the shadows
-   - Christine watches out the curtained living room windows, eyes red rimmed from worry but not from tears, not yet, as a police car finally pulls up
Neighbors look on as the officers get out and approach the house
on Christine's face, pale and worried, : (
) Our thoughts go out again to Mrs
Christine Collins, of Lincoln Heights -- '   - Located at 5100 Coliseum Street (
) -- whose young son, Walter Collins, disappeared almost two weeks ago
'  - large radio microphone with the call letters  is atop a podium, where    stands: fifties, barrel chested, no-nonsense, a fire-and-brimstone preacher
His congregation sits in hard wooden pews, listening and nodding
Though she is not a member of our congregation, we pray for her today (more) True Story                                    14
(Cont'd) as we have every day since we first learned of her situation on the radio, and in the newspapers
(beat) We are told that the Los Angeles Police Department is doing the best it can to reunite mother and child, and  am sure that is true
(beat) But given its position as the most violent, corrupt and incompetent police department this side of the Rocky Mountains, that's not saying a great deal
There's  and cheering from the pews
He lets it pass
Every day, new bodies show up along Mulholland, or in ditches, the work of Police Chief James Davis and his so-called "gun squad
" Every day the needs of honest citizens are put second to greed and personal gain
Every day, the city sinks deeper into a cesspool of fear, intimidation and corruption
Once the City of Angels, Los Angeles is now a place where our protectors have become our brutalizers
where to be the law
is to be above the law
where none dare speak truth to power
(beat) But we will not be silent
We will continue to put their offenses and their failures in full view of the public
We will not be intimidated
The place erupts into applause and cheering
'  - , 40s, hard-edged and tall, stands looking out the window as the radio drones on behind him
(on radio) Because while the "gun squad" speaks in the only language Chief Davis understands, we speak in the language of compassion, truth and strength
We speak for our fellow citizens, beaten and killed by a renegade police department
(more) True Story                                     15
(on radio) (Cont'd) We speak for an innocent child, ripped from his mother's arms, now all but forgotten by the police
And that voice, my friends, will never be silenced
More cheers and applause as Davis switches off the radio
: - '  - The alarm goes off, but Christine is already awake
Staring up at the ceiling
She slowly pulls herself up and moves
:  3, 1928 '  - Christine walks past the door to his bedroom
Looks inside
Goes over to the bed
Her hand lingers, touching it, : (
) Are you sure you're ready for this, Christine
-  - Christine and Mr
Harris, the floor manager, approach the doors to the switchboard room
mean, if you need more time -- The police are doing all they can, and frankly  could use the money
It's been almost a month, and
it wouldn't do any good to find Walter and bring him home if he doesn't have a home to come back to, right
Of course
He smiles as he says it, but there's the sense that he doesn't think Walter's coming back
It's been too long
She senses it, but moves past it, pushing open the door and entering - As loud as before
until the operators see Christine, and the noise stops
She tries to smile, as if to say, 'm okay, but can't quite manage it
True Story                                      16
Several women approach and hug her as the noise level begins to climb, but nowhere near what it was a moment earlier
Well
'll leave you to it, then
She nods as he exits, then heads off herself
- Christine moves from station to station, the noise level still noticeably low
Every time she approaches an operator, they lower their voices, as if not to bother her
One operator holds up a pink request sheet
Christine starts toward her, but then the operator glances to another supervisor and hands it off
Knowing she has to do something about this, she turns to the room and, in a firm, clear voice, says: Excuse me, can  have your attention
The room grows quiet
Everyone is looking at her
Listen, everyone,  appreciate your consideration, but 'm not made of porcelain
won't break down and cry if the station to station call to Kankakee doesn't go through
(a thin smile) Actually,
promised myself that wouldn't cry
wouldn't let myself cry
until  knew, one way or another, what
(beat) Point is
like the noise here
So don't be afraid to talk and
push buttons, and drop things
If it wasn't noisy, how would  know was in the right place
She manages a thin smile as the place returns to normal
- Mr
Harris steps out into the lunch area where a number of the operators and supervisors are hanging out
Excuse me, has anyone seen Christine
think  saw her in the back office
He nods his thanks, and continues off
True Story                                      17
-   - He approaches the door, slowing as he  Christine inside
(
) -- well, if you do hear anything, would you let me know
Thanks, appreciate it
Goodbye
hang-up, then dialing
He glances in the open doorway
Christine sits at a table, phone in hand, a list of phone numbers in front of her
The list reads ,    , on and on
with each having multiple checks beside it, indicating all the times she's called
Her lunch sits untouched beside her
She puts a check next to then looks up as someone answers at the other end of the phone

yes, fine, thank you
was just checking back to see if you had found any missing or lost children that might match the -- (beat) see
No,  appreciate that, it's just
it never hurts to make sure all the lines of communication are working
mean, that's what  do for a living, right
(beat) Well, 'll try back next week
If you do hear anything in the meantime, would you be sure to let me know
Thanks
Goodbye
She hangs up and ticks another department off the list and dials again
Mr
Harris heads away, deciding that whatever it was he planned to talk to her about
it can wait
Missing persons department, please

- THe  who owns this dive is cleaning the griddle and keeping an eye on the only two customers in the place: a  and a young , both wearing hats, as was the custom
They're unkempt, dirty, like they've been on the road a long time
They finish the last of the food as the cook approaches, tears off the bill and puts it on the table
Two dollars
The Man reaches for his wallet
Pats an empty pocket
Tries the other pocket
Nothing
Hell
looks like  left my wallet at home
Can  owe it to you
No credit
Pay up or  call the cops
'm tired of bums like you coming around here
'm not trying to stiff you, chief
just left my wallet at home, that's all
'll go back and get it
Five, ten minutes tops
The Cook hesitates; he doesn't want the trouble of bringing in the cops, but he doesn't want to get stuck, either
You got any collateral
The Man glances at the Boy seated beside him
The boy's face is dirty, partially obscured by the hat
Can't ask for better collateral than a man's own flesh and blood, right
(to the boy) You stay here, son, 'll be right back
But -- Now don't give me any trouble
He's a good man to trust us like this
You just sit here while  go get my wallet
Okay
True Story                                      19
The boy nods reluctantly, looks away as the man rises
Ten minutes, then 'm calling the cops
The Man nods, exits and drives off
The Cook squints warily at the Boy, then at the wall clock
It's 2:00
- No car
Just the empty parking lot
- It's 3:15
The Cook is annoyed
He glances to the Boy, who won't meet his gaze
Finally: Ah, hell
He goes to the phone
Clicks the receiver a few times
Hello, Myrtle
It's Harve, down by the diner
Would you get me Sheriff Larsen
Yeah, 'll wait
He casts a sour look in the boy's direction
What's your name, son
Son
The boy takes a , looking out at the road
Then: don't remember
Swell
-   - As before, Christine hurries from one station to another, lost in the barely-managed chaos
She stops at one station, glancing over papers, then looks over at -- -- the window to Mr
Harris' office, where he is talking with a police officer,
, 30s, serious, arch
She slows, unable to look away, a growing dread settling in her heart
Harris points out the window
Points
to her
The police captain nods and enters the switchboard room
As Jones heads for her, the strength goes out of Christine's legs
She holds onto the a desk as he stops before her
True Story                                   20
Mrs
Collins
She manages a nod
Behind her eyes is the terror: he's going to tell me my son is dead
The room gets very quiet
My name is Captain
Jones, Lincoln Park Juvenile Division
My office supervises all runaway and missing child cases, including your son's, and
(beat, a smile) He's alive, Mrs
Collins
He was picked up two days ago by local police in De Kalb, Illinois
He's safe and unhurt
He was in the company of some drifter, we've got an  out for him now, and -- But she hasn't heard anything past he's safe and unhurt
She almost goes to the floor as other women rush toward her, crying and embracing her
For the first time, Christine cries, great wracking sobs, all the emotion she's been fighting back all this time coming out at last
he's okay
he's okay
: - Jones and Christine are in a police car pulling up to the train station
It moves through a police line holding back a crowd of reporters who  questions at the passing car
All these reporters
you didn't tell me -- Yours is a story with a happy ending, Mrs
Collins
People love happy endings
(checks watch) Train should be pulling in shortly
We'd better get a move on
As Christine and Jones step out, they're mobbed by the press
Jones smiles splendidly for the cameras, waves, one arm wrapped around Christine, who looks stunned by it all
Thank you
we'll have a statement for you in a little while
(more) True Story                                      21
(Cont'd) Right now the important thing is to re-unite this little lady with her son
So if you'll excuse us
Beaming, Jones escorts Christine into Union Station
- Seated on a bench is a  , and beside her, the from the De Kalb diner
who we will identify henceforth as "Walter
" He is looking out the window at the passing scenery
"" Did you know that Los Angeles is where they make the Tom Mix movies
No,  didn't
"" His horse is named Blue
(beat) You think they'll let me watch them make a movie
don't know, you'll have to ask
But with all this attention, who knows, maybe they will
The boy turns his attention back out the window as we the  of the train pulling into Union Station
-   - We  the same train whistle from this side as Christine and Jones come to the ramp,    is waiting
The reporters are held back at the entrance to the platform
Mrs
Collins, 'd like to introduce you to Chief of Police James
Davis
Oh, my,  didn't expect -- We don't get a lot of positive attention from the boys in the press these days, so it's good to be here when there's a positive story, don't you think
True Story                                   22
But she's distracted, looking off to the end of the platform, where the train is starting to pull in
take it you've been treated well by my boys in the department
Oh
yes, of course, they've been great
Well, there was that part about having to wait twenty-four hours before filing a report, but -- Technicalities aside -- The train stops
Doors begin to open
Yes
other than that, no complaints
They've all been wonderful
Good, then you won't have any problem telling that to the press, and how the  is concerned first and foremost with the safety of -- But she's already running down the platform as people start to step off the train
Jones exchanges a look with Davis
Women
Just a sec
He trots off to catch up with Christine, who walks alongside the train, looking from window to window, anxious, eager
Then: the Matron gets off the train, her frame momentarily blocking the view of the boy beside her
but Christine spots them
With Jones not far behind, she breaks into a run
Walter
Walter
She runs toward them
The matron turns, sees her, smiles and gets out of the way, revealing the boy
Christine stops
Staggers so hard she almost falls
She steps forward slowly, a hand going to her mouth
For a moment, we're not sure what's going through her mind
She looks to the matron, who smiles
Looks to the boy, who smiles
Then she steps back a pace, horror sinking in as Jones comes jauntily alongside her
True Story                                      23
Well
Aren't you going to -- He's not my son
Jones freezes at the words
what are you -- He's not my son
(beat) He's not my son
'm
'm sure you're mistaken
Mistaken
He's been through four long, terrible months
he's gone through changes, lost weight -- know my own son
He glances over his shoulder to where the Chief of Police is waiting, not aware of any of this, and beyond him
the press
'm just saying
mean, you're in shock, and he's changed, and -- He turns from her, stoops down to look at the boy
What's your name, son
Can you tell me your name
"" Walter Collins
Christine steps back as though slapped
This can't be
It's a common name, it -- Do you know where you live, Walter
Do you know your home address
The boy considers for a moment

"" My house is at 210 North Avenue 23, Los Angeles, California
(beat) And that's my Mommy
And he  to her, grabbing her around the waist, which only magnifies her horror
Jones has no idea what to make of her, or this, or the boy
The only thing he knows is that the chief of police is standing right over there, smiling now that he thinks he's seen a mother and child reunion
The press is nearly insane trying to get through to them
Mrs
Collins
listen to me know you're feeling uncertain right now, but that's to be expected
a boy this age changes so fast
but we've compensated for that in our investigation
We're experts in child identification
There's no question that this is your son
It's not Walter
It's not Walter as you remember him
That's why it's important for you to take him home, on a
trial basis
trial basis
Once you've put him back in familiar surroundings, and given yourself time to recover from the shock of his changed condition
you'll see that it is him
swear to you, Mrs
Collins
give you my word
Trust me
this is your son
She looks from him to the boy
who is not terribly dissimilar from Walter
so that even the audience may not be entirely sure if it's him or not
and part of her wants desperately to believe
the pressure is immense
If there's any problem, any problem at all, come and talk to me and 'll take care of it
(beat) Mrs
Collins
he has nowhere else to go
True Story                                   25
It's an agonizing moment, then finally: look, 'll take him home, but only because
might not be thinking clearly right now, and -- Thank you
Without giving her a moment to reconsider, he waves and the Chief of Police approaches as the press rushes toward them
In an instant, they're overwhelmed by people shouting questions, flashbulbs popping, a fever of excitement
How does it feel to have your son home, Mrs
Collins
What did you think when you saw him for the first time
It was
it's
hard to explain
(jumping in) It was certainly quite a shock
At first she hardly recognized him
Perfectly natural, the boy's been through quite an ordeal
How're you feeling, son
Bet it feels great to be home
"" Yeah, it's great
The Los Angeles Police Department is thankful for all the hard work done by the De Kalb County Sheriff's Department in helping to make this joyful reunion possible

Absolutely
He poses Christine and "Walter" so she is holding the boy in her arms
Dazed, stunned, confused, she manages to smile for the cameras
Bulbs  and -- -- time  , the  , as Christine looks around at it all as though in a dream
reporters shouting questions she doesn't hear
bulbs flashing
the boy beside her, smiling at it all
He looks at her, mouths the word Mommy, as -- - -- the car door  and she and the boy sit side by side
The silence is in profound contrast to the madness of a moment earlier
An officer gets in they drive off, passing Jones and the Chief of Police, talking quietly off to one side
Christine looks to the boy
He smiles at her
-  - The only noise is the clock on the wall, ticking
Christine sits at one end of the table, "Walter" at the other
Studying him
He is finishing a sandwich, not meeting her gaze
Was the sandwich all right
(he nods) Would you like some more milk
"" No
No, thank you
"" No, thank you
Now you need a bath
You're covered with soot from the train ride
He turns, and heads up the stairs

Did you hurt yourself
Let me see -- She stops suddenly, reacting to something we don't see
Looks slowly looks up to his face
circumcised
She takes his hand and marches him out of the bathroom
She places him against the wall where she measured Walter's growth over the years
The marks put him four inches shorter than the one labeled March
She looks at him, very serious
The last time  measured Walter -- the last time  measured my son -- he was four inches taller than you are right now
(beat) Who are you
(beat) What are you doing here
(beat) Who are you
He says nothing
on her look of growing desperation
-  - Jones walks quickly down the hall, trying to look interested in a clutch of papers in his hands, Christine following after
He's not my son
Mrs
Collins -- True Story                                   28
don't know who he is, or why he's saying he's Walter, but there's clearly been some kind of mistake
We agreed you would give him time to adjust -- He's four inches shorter than Walter
Boys his age don't shrink
If anything, he should be taller
Maybe your measurements are off
Look, 'm sure there's a reasonable explanation for -- He's circumcised
Walter wasn't
Jones glances back, uncomfortable about discussing circumcision with a woman in public view
He lowers his voice
Mrs
Collins
your son was missing for four months
For at least part of that in the company of an as-yet unidentified drifter
Who knows what such a disturbed individual might have done
He could have had him
circumcised
might have -- Made him smaller
Captain, please -- He's on the move again, stepping into -- '  - -- and getting behind his desk as Christine follows him in
-- why won't you listen to me
am listening, damn it,  -- (beat, calmer) am listening
And  understand your feelings
He's changed, no mistake
You've both been through a terrible experience
That's why he needs your support and love to bounce back
True Story                                       29
Captain, that boy wouldn't bounce back as my son if you coated him in rubber and dropped him off the roof
He sits, shaking his head
Why are you doing this, Mrs
Collins
You seem perfectly capable of taking care of the boy, your work pays you enough to attend to his personal needs
so  don't understand why you're trying to run away from your responsibilities -- 'm not running away from anything, least of all my responsibilities
'm even taking care of that boy because right now 'm all he has
What worries me is that you've stopped looking for Walter
Why should we look someone we've already found
But you haven't found him
He's still out there somewhere, lost, maybe hurt
His identity has been confirmed by the best minds in the field of child identification, people who know what they're doing
And  don't
Captain, look,  don't want to cause trouble for you or the department
Honestly  don't
know you've done everything you can
but there's been a terrible mistake, and  need your help if we're going to correct it
before it's too late
Please
She exits
Annoyed, Jones paces, then picks up the phone

Tarr on the phone

Collins
Dr
Earl
Tarr
Captain Jones sent me

May  come in
Oh
yes, of course
She steps aside, and Dr
Tarr enters, looking around
Thank you for coming
'm surprised Captain Jones moved so quickly was starting to think he didn't believe me
Well, 'm here now, and we'll put all that to rights
Where is the boy
He looks up as "Walter" comes downstairs
Noting that he said "the boy," not "your son," Christine looks relieved
Ah
There he is
handsome young man
He has your eyes, doesn't he
And a little bit of the nose
Very fit, in spite of all his travails
very resilient boy you've got here, Mrs
Collins
As he bends down to look more closely at "Walter," Christine stiffens
she can't have heard that right
Doctor Tarr,  thought you were here to help me

Captain Jones said the boy had gone through some extreme physical changes, and asked me to look in on him
to reassure you in this your time of motherly concern
My "motherly concern" isn't for him because he's not my son
True Story                           31
Statements like that will hardly help the boy's self-esteem, now will they
(beat) Captain Jones said something about a change in height
He's four inches shorter than -- Ah, well
hardly a mystery, Mrs
Collins
We've known for some time that trauma can affect the growth of children
Given the stress of the last four months his spine may have actually shrunk
It's uncommon, but within the realm of possibility
What about the circumcision
Very likely his abductor thought it appropriate
After all, circumcision is hygienically sound
Must have been quite traumatic at the time
No wonder he's submerged the memory
Look, doctor -- As you can see, there's a perfectly sound medical explanation for all of this
But it's good for you to raise these questions
You should be apprised of all changes the lad went through during his absence
Wouldn't  know whether or not he was my son
'm his mother
Which means you're in no position to be objective
You are looking through the prism of extreme emotion at a boy who has changed from what you remember
He isn't the same boy that left here, just as a boy who goes off to war and returns isn't the same anymore

(Cont'd) mother's heart, driven by intuition and emotion rather than logic, sees these changes and rebels, insists that this cannot be your son
But that doesn't change the facts

Collins

What're you -- Before she can react, he takes Walter by the hand and leads him outside

Tarr strides onward, the police officer and "Walter" walking alongside as Christine brings up the rear

Hello, children, my name is Dr
Earl
Tarr
'd like to ask you some questions
1ST My mom says we're not supposed to talk to strangers
Good boy
Quite right
But as you see 'm with the police, so it's all right
Now, 'm sure you know Mrs
Collins here, and her son, Walter
How many of you recognize this young boy as Walter Collins
He looks from one child to the other
They don't reply
Either they don't recognize him, or they're intimidated
Now, now, no need to be afraid
Surely you knew Walter, and played with him
So which of you can identify Walter for me, for his mother, and for the police
This officer would want you to do the right thing as good young citizens
The kids exchange a glance
It's clear they don't recognize the boy, but they're intimidated by the presence of Tarr and the police officer
few reluctantly raise their hands
Another of them goes to "Walter," who is shorter than he is
True Story                                   33
2ND Walter was as tall as me
Yes, precisely
He was as tall as you
Now he's not
He's lost a little height, you see
It's a thing called trauma
With luck, none of you will ever have to find out about it yourselves
So other than that, do you recognize this as your friend, Walter Collins
2ND guess
Dr
Tarr -- Already ahead of you, Mrs
Collins; children can be intimidated
But not adults
Shall we try a neighbor
He heads off again, like some very tall, strange bird marching down the street
Christine exchanges a look with the kids, then heads off to follow

Riley, the officer and "Walter" stand on the porch

Oh, yes
yes
that's Walter all right
Used to come here all the time to play with my nephew, Roger

Thank you, Mrs
Riley
You've been a big help,  -- Before we go
Mrs
Riley, do you have the time
Certainly
She looks at her watch
Holds it farther away
Can't quite focus on it
Pulls her glasses out from inside her blouse
My last concession to vanity; men don't make passes at women who wear glasses, you know
(checks the watch) Five o'clock
Thank you
Mrs
Riley nods and heads inside as Christine looks to Tarr, who shrugs off what was just demonstrated
boy is much larger than a watch, Mrs
Collins

Tarr takes "Walter's" hand and heads away, Christine following, anger growing in her eyes as we : (
) This is absolutely outrageous

Fine
She hangs up

The events of the day have her teetering on the edge, but she's holding on
She pulls herself together and goes to the sink, furiously doing dishes for a silent before "Walter" looks up from his now-empty plate
"" 'm finished

Go on up
"Walter" rises, as Christine continues to clean dishes, not looking back at him
Exhausted mentally, physically and emotionally
He goes to the door, stops, turns
"" 'night, Mommy
Christine fumbles the plate and it  to the floor
She turns furiously to "Walter
" Stop saying that

She moves toward him, her anger coming out at last
He tears off as she slumps to the floor, covering her eyes

Her voice is soft, but firm

You're still a child, and  think you don't really understand what you're doing, the hurt you're causing
Maybe this is all just some big game of pretend to you, but  need you to understand
Walter is

Christine sits in a car with Briegleb, looking at it all

Good luck
She nods, exits the car and walks up the steps to the front of City Hall as he drives off
She stands before the press, looks at them for a moment, then begins
Good morning
My name is Christine Collins

As the reporters start to shout out questions, we to a   who has been watching
He goes quickly to a police call-box, unlocks it and picks up the telephone
- The glass door to Captain Jones' office is closed, but we can him on the phone
Finally, he hangs up and comes out of the office
His tone is cold but neutral
we think this could go either way
He stops an officer
Morelli,  want you to find the Collins woman and get her here
Bring her in the back way, and have a couple of matrons standing by
1ST Yes, sir
He heads off as Jones goes into his office, closing the door

They dash through the rain to the back door, followed by the 1st Cop
Why are we using the back door
1ST Captain's orders

Is it
She allows a moment of quiet satisfaction as she's led into - where she's directed to a wooden bench
nearby clock reads 3:45
She sits, "Walter" silent beside her
In the , the Desk Sergeant puts a call on hold
Hey
anybody want to take a call from the Royal Canadian Mounties
Ybarra

What'd they do, lose a moose

They need a juvenile living here illegally deported back to Canada
He's living with his cousin on some ranch near Riverside, in Wineville
All right, 'll take it, got nothing better to do
Ybarra takes the call as Jones' calls from his office
Mrs
Collins
Christine starts to take "Walter's" hand when a matron appears
Leave the boy for now
We'll look after him
She hands "Walter" over to the matron, then enters ' He leaves the door open and indicates for Christine to sit
She does
He paces, working up to what he's going to do
You've put us through quite a bit of trouble, Mrs
Collins
This situation has become an embarrassment for the entire department
It wasn't my intention to embarrass anyone
No, of course not
You just told the papers we can't tell one boy from another as a compliment for the months we spent working on your case
Are you trying to make fools out of us
Is that it
Do you enjoy this
No, of course not
had to get your attention,  had to make you understand
he's not my son
He circles, closing in on her
She becomes aware that the door is open, and he's doing this for the benefit of anyone who might be listening in
True Story                            49
You know what your problem is
You want to shirk your responsibilities as a mother
You enjoyed being a free woman, didn't you
Enjoyed not having to worry about a young son
You could do what you wanted, go where you wanted, see anyone you wanted
But then we found your son
Brought him back
And now he's an inconvenience
That's why you cooked up this whole scheme, to try and throw him to the state, let the state raise him for you
That's not true
No
Even the boy says he's your son
Why would he do that
How would he know to do that
don't know
All  know is that he's lying
Maybe so
Maybe he is a liar
But that's how he's been trained, isn't it
Lying was born in both of you
You're a liar and a troublemaker and if you ask me you've got no business walking the streets of Los Angeles
Just a minute -- Because either you know you're lying, or you're not capable of knowing if you're lying or telling the truth
So which is it, Mrs
Collins
Are you a derelict mother
Or just nuts
Because from where  sit, those are the only options
'm not going to sit here and take this -- Jones stands between her and the door
True Story                                      50
You want to bring in experts
Doctors
Well,  can do that too
(calling ) Matron
The door opens, and a   enters
He looks back to Christine, his voice low, his anger replaced by cool determination
This scene is about to take an abrupt change
Mrs
Collins
do you still insist that the boy out there is not your son
Yes
He nods to the matron, who moves to restrain her
Wait
what are you doing
The Matron cuffs Christine's hands behind her back
Please don't struggle, ma'am
You'll only hurt yourself
, and the handcuffs are in place
(to the matron) You are to convey the prisoner to the Los Angeles County General Hospital Psychopathic Ward
No

Collins has been known to us since about March 10, 1928, when she reported her nine-year-old son Walter missing
stunned and dazed Christine rides in the back of the van (
) The boy was gone until July, 1928
Since his return, she has complained that he is still missing, and has made repeated requests that he be found, saying, "This is not my Walter," even though positive identification has been established

The matron leads a stunned Christine to the front desk

) She suffers from paranoia, delusions of persecution, and dislocation from reality
She may be a threat to herself or others
We recommend that she be conveyed to the psychopathic ward for treatment and observation until her senses can be restored

Jones, Lincoln Heights division

you have to listen to me
The police are doing this to punish me
They tried to force this boy on me and tell me he was my son, but it wasn't my son, and now they say 'm crazy -- She stops, noting the looks exchanged between the nurse and the matron
Her story sounds insane, even to her
She begins to realize the depth of her predicament
Oh, god
oh god, please, no
If you continue to struggle 'll have to put you in a straitjacket
Do you want that
(she shakes head) Good
Then behave yourself
(to orderlies) Code twelve
The matron turns Christine over to two large male , who take her by the arms and lead her into the psycho ward
No, please, you have to listen to me

They force-march her down the hall, the screams of the insane growing louder, falling deeper into the nightmare

Take off your clothes
Why
Physical examination, body cavity search and de-lousing
Required for all new patients
The nurse begins putting on a pair of rubber gloves

That's not necessary -- You can remove your clothes yourself, or  can have the orderlies do it for you
Which do you prefer
Reluctantly, Christine begins to remove her clothes
- '  as she stands in a spray of water and disinfectant, some coming from the showerhead above, some from a hose sprayed on her by the Nurse in
Christine's eyes are closed, trying to shut out the sense of violation
Spread your legs

Biting her lip, Christine complies
- Wet hair plastered to her face, dressed in a hospital gown, Christine is led down a long hall by the Nurse
As she passes the closed doors, we  women weeping, talking to themselves, crying out, screaming, beating on the walls
Fingers poke through narrow viewing slits in the doors
The Nurse pulls out a key-ring and unlocks one of the doors
Inside
Christine enters -- - Bare, forbidding, four white walls and a narrow slit of a window
It's a two-person room
Sitting on the other bed is another

The detective we saw earlier, Ybarra, is inside
He rolls down the window
Problem

Overheated, that's all
She'll be fine in a bit
Listen, could you give me a hand
'm trying to find a place called the Northcott Ranch, up by Wineville
As he answers, Gordon moves casually to the back of the open truck to get a rag to wipe his hands
There is a  on the floor of the trunk
Gordon picks it up inside the rag
Northcott Ranch
oh yeah
You're almost there
Follow this west for about two, three miles
Then the next right
That'll bring you right to it
Something going on
Just looking into a juvenile matter
Thanks for the help
Ybarra drives away
As soon as he's out of sight, Gordon slams the hood, runs to the driver's side and starts the truck, still steaming
He drives off as fast as he can
- long, low house, stonework and brick and wood, behind a large open area cluttered with junked cars
At the far end of the open area is a chicken coop, about fifteen feet long
Ybarra drives up in front of the house, gets out, looks around
Hello
- Someone is watching as Ybarra moves toward the main house
Anybody home
Ybarra glances off to a rustling , and follows it to few chickens inside, held back by wire
An ax is nearby, its stained edge buried in an old wooden stump
corner of the coop seems to have come down and been crudely repaired
True Story                                      56
As suddenly someone runs across the dirt yard into the house, the door
Ybarra runs to the porch, tries the door
Locked from the inside
He pounds on the door
This is the police
have a warrant for a minor named Sanford Clark
Open the door and stand aside
No reply
He braces himself and  open the door
- The door  against the wall
Flies buzz around the place
The kitchen is in shadows, but there's no question it's a mess
Ybarra moves cautiously through the kitchen
No sound except the wood creaking beneath his feet as he enters - Old, musty, shadowed
The ticking of an old grandfather clock
There's no one in sight
Ybarra moves down the hall, glances into two adjoining rooms
Nothing
He continues into - Curtains drawn, dark, cocooned against the outside world
Ybarra makes a circuit of the room, then  at a creak of wood from a
He moves toward it
Pauses
Reaches for the doorknob
as suddenly a clock  loudly and the closet explodes outward and -- --  , 15, runs out
He slams into Ybarra, knocking him down
They go down in a tumble of limbs, wrestling on the floor as Sanford tries to escape
Stop it
Stop it or 'll push your face through the floor
Breathing hard, Sanford finally stops struggling
Ybarra cuffs Sanford's hands behind his back
On your feet
Sanford stands, and as Ybarra leads him out, we   a mantle and a photo that shows Sanford Clark and a man we recognize as the one we saw by the road earlier: Gordon Northcott
'  - Ybarra locks Sanford in the car, then climbs in the driver's side
He checks a cut on his face in the rear-view mirror

Jesus
what the hell's wrong with you
Don't you know assaulting a cop is against the law
What difference does it make now
We're just sending you back to Canada, son, it isn't the end of the world
What
You can't just stay in the
as long as you want, pal
We've got a orders to send you back home, and -- Suddenly Sanford starts laughing
It's a nearly hysterical laugh, half fear and half relief
Ybarra isn't there for the reasons he thought
Ybarra is puzzled by his reaction
Didn't know Canada was that funny
Ybarra puts the car into gear and drives off
'   - Enough to , then: ' - Gustav Briegleb sits behind the microphone, waiting to go on the air
He looks at the clock

Glances to an
No word from Mrs
Collins

If she's not there, call the , see what they know

-   - Christine is in bed, wide awake, the sounds of the asylum somewhat lessened now
Her face is dimly lit by moonlight
(

Since she can't be here to tell you what she told the press this afternoon, 'll fill in the best  can
'm going to tell you what happened, and 'm going to keep telling you right here, every night
until someone does something about it
On her face, we go to -   - Gordon Northcott makes his way to the ticket booth
'd like a ticket to Canada
Alberta or Vancouver, whatever's leaving tonight
Don't have anything going that far tonight
Best  can do is put you on a train for Seattle
From there you can transfer to one of the locals or drive across the border
That'll be fine
Round-trip
One way
The vender moves away to pull the ticket
Gordon glances at a cop heading his way
Stiffens
The cop continues past him
Gordon relaxes as the vender slides the ticket across
That'll be fifteen dollars
Gordon pays for the ticket and heads toward the boarding gates

- Just enough to establish the transition
- Christine is on top of the bed, eyes open, not having slept all night
She's staring at the woman on the next cot
THe woman is staring back at her
The second-hand on a clock behind protective chicken-wire passes 8:00 and a loud goes off, announcing the start of the day
We hear doors being unlocked up and down the hall
Christine stands, pulls her hair back, and catches her reflection in the window: pale, drawn, smudged, and in a hospital gown
looking like someone who actually belongs in this place
The door opens and she steps into the hall as a  passes
Can  see the doctor
Or someone in charge -- Breakfast is half an hour
But  -- Down the hall
The doctor will call for you when he's ready
(beat) Go or stay, either way  lock the door
Christine doesn't want to stay, so she moves off
-   -   - Christine and the other patients sit at long tables
few talk in quiet whispers, but most eat silently, staring vacantly ahead
Some have scars showing lobotomies or electro- convulsive (shock) therapy
It's a scary bunch
Christine isn't eating
Another female patient,  , thirties, watches Christine then slides closer
, then: You should eat
Eating is normal
You got to do everything you can to look normal
That's the only chance you've got
Besides, you'll need the strength

Christine is startled by the level-headedness of the advice from someone she assumed was probably nuts
Reluctantly, she begins eating the cold-looking oatmeal
My name's Carol Dexter
What's yours
Christine
Christine Collins
Christine reacts to the taste of the food, which is awful
Finish it all
know it's hard, but you have to   try
Lunch isn't as bad
Close,    but not as -- won't be here that long
As soon as  can talk to a doctor, they'll realize there's been a terrible mistake and -- Yeah, that always works
(beat, quieter) heard them talking
You're here on a code twelve, police action
The doctors, the staff, they figure that if the police sent you here, there must be a good reason for it
Then 'll just have to prove that 'm not insane
Yeah
How
The more you try to act sane, the crazier you start to look
If you smile too much, you're delusional or stifling hysteria
If you don't smile, you're depressed
If you're neutral you're emotionally withdrawn and potentially catatonic
You seem to have given this a great deal of thought
have
Don't you get it
You're code twelve
So am
We're here for the same reason
(beat) We pissed off the cops
True Story                                   61
Christine sits back heavily, starting to understand the world more than she ever wanted to
What, you thought you were the only one
(points os) The lady over there was married to a cop who kept beating her up
When she tried to tell somebody, they sent her here
And that one
The police beat the crap out of her brother, broke both his arms
When she complained to the papers, they picked her up and
What about you
work nights
(Chris doesn't get it) mean,  work nights
Downtown
In some of the clubs
You know
It gets through
Hooker
Christine nods
This one client started hitting me, and he wouldn't stop
So  filed a complaint
Turns out he was a cop
Next thing  know, 'm here
But how can they -- You're kidding right
Hey, everybody knows women are fragile, right
They're all emotions, no logic, nothin' goin' on upstairs
And sometimes, like when they say something that's a little, y'know, inconvenient
they just go fucking nuts, pardon my French
If we're insane, nobody has to listen to us
mean, who are you going to believe, some crazy woman trying to destroy the integrity of the force, or a police officer
Then once they get us in here, we either learn to behave, and shut up, or -- (beat) Or you don't go home
or you go home like that

She nods to an older woman whose upper temples are marred by surgical scars
Lobotomized
Christine turns away
Better finish up your oatmeal
Want to look sane for the doctors
Then  want to hear what they nailed you for
Numb with horror, Christine forces down the oatmeal
- Sanford Clark sits near several other juveniles being held
Pensive, nervous, he watches a kid absently tapping a ruler against his knees
the ruler
Rising
Falling
Tapping
Then back -- -- on Sanford as we hear it continuing to tap his face
Then, suddenly -- -- on a , rising and falling in tune with the ruler tapping
There's blood on the hatchet
Gordon Northcott's eyes glitter insanely as he brings the hatchet down again and just as it comes right   we flash -- As Sanford   with the memory

He turns away, won't meet their gaze
Something's terribly wrong
Just then, an  comes in

Sanford rises, goes to the Administrator
Paperwork's come through
You'll be deported back to Canada day after tomorrow
The police there will to decide what to do with you next hope your stay here has convinced you not to try crossing the border illegally in future
He starts to turn and walk away when: True Story                                     63
Wait,
want to talk to the officer who brought me in
'm sure he has far more important things to do than -- Please
It's important
The Administrator senses that he's sincere, and troubled
He's off-duty until tomorrow, but
'll see what  can do
No promises
And with that, the administrator heads away
- Gordon Northcott is hitch-hiking by the side of the road truck approaches, passes him
then slows and stops
Gordon runs up to the truck as the  leans out
How far you going
Vancouver
Hop in
Gordon climbs into the truck and goes to shove his bag under the seat
when something metallic bangs underneath
He lifts out a short length of metal pipe
Don't worry about that, pal
Just a little insurance
couple of guys tried to hijack my truck a few years ago so they could run booze over the border
You can't be too safe, you know
Yeah,  surely do
Gordon smiles, moves as if to hand the pipe back
and suddenly it  on the Driver's head
over and over and over
Blood splatters his face
Breathing hard, Gordon shoves the Driver out of the truck into the undergrowth then drives off

Mrs
Collins
Dr
Jonathan Steele
Please, have a seat
The nurse leaves
Christine notes that there are three chairs in a row
Could be a test
She sits in the middle chair
Sits as straight as she can
Trying to look sane
hope your stay has been comfortable so far
Fine
Thank you
Really
'd think it would be quite difficult at first
(catching herself) Well, it was
Difficult,  mean
But comfortable
He makes a note of this
She grimaces
This isn't going well
He motions to the bandage on her arm
see they took a blood test
Wasserman Test
To check for syphilis
Apparently it can affect the mind
The idea that someone thinks you should be checked for syphilis
did that upset you
No
Not at all
'm sure it's
standard procedure
She smiles a forced smile
Trying to appear level-headed
True Story                                  65
Yes
Exactly
Standard procedure
We have to cover all bases, and -- (covering her bases) But
at the same time
imagine that it would be
would probably be upsetting to
some people that someone else might
suspect that of them
(beat) However inappropriate that might be
She flashes another wan smile
He makes another note, picks up the report on his desk, glances it over
According to your file, you believe the police have substituted a fake boy for your son
Is that true
didn't say they substituted a fake boy, just
not the right boy
(beat) They brought back the wrong boy
Not my son
He's still missing
He starts pulling out papers from his file
That's strange
you see,  have here a newspaper article with a photo of you at the train station, welcoming your son home
That is you in the photo, isn't it
Yes
So at first he was your son, but now he's not your son
(beat) Has this been going on for a long time
People
changing, becoming something other than what they are
People don't change, doctor
You don't think people change
True Story                                     66
That's not what  -- And the police
they're not out to persecute you
No
Of course not
The police are here to protect us
That's right
He nods
She's trying to say what she thinks he wants to hear
It's a chess match that ends with: That's odd, because according to the head nurse, when you were admitted you accused the police of conspiring to do this deliberately, to punish you
So either she and the interns are also conspiring against you
or you're changing your story
(beat) Do you often have trouble telling reality from fantasy, Mrs
Collins
He sits back
Christine's face tells the story
- It's raining
The Administrator enters with Detective Ybarra
'm sorry to bring you out in this weather, detective, but the boy has been quite insistent
It's all right, 'll just see what he has to say so  can go home and get dry
Where is he
Room seven
- single table, two chairs
Sanford sits quietly, nervously, as Ybarra hangs his wet coat up on a hook
True Story                                   67
It's raining cats, dogs and democrats out there, so this better be worth it
He sits across the table from Sanford, lights up a cigarette
Sanford's mouth works for a moment, but nothing comes out
Well
Look,  -- this isn't easy, okay
Nothing is
long
Sanford composes himself, begins: My cousin's Gordon Northcott
He owns the ranch where you found me
He let me live there in exchange for watching the place when he was gone, doing chores, stuff like that
Said  could stay on as long as wanted to
figured that also meant  could leave whenever  wanted to, but he wouldn't let me
Are you saying he held you prisoner
(sanford nods) Bull
When  got to the ranch you were running around free as a jaybird
Could've left any time you wanted
So what's this, some kind of story to cover why you were in the country illegally
No
no, it's nothing like that
Because  don't have time for -- Listen to me, please
He said -- What
What did he -- He said that if  tried to leave, he'd kill me
(more) True Story                                        68
(Cont'd) You don't understand, you don't know what he's like, what he
what we did
what he made me do
Sanford is in tears by now
Ybarra realizes that there's something real going on here, and backs off
Okay, lets start at the beginning
What did he make you do
Sanford closes his eyes
Takes a long beat
Finally
Him and me
me and Gordon, we
(beat, softly) we killed some kids
Ybarra freezes, the cigarette not moving in his hand
didn't mean to,  swear
he made me help him, said if  didn't he'd kill me, too
Please, you gotta help me
'm scared
don't want to go to Hell for killing kids
What kids
don't know
never knew their names
How many kids
All together
He thinks about it for a moment
The fact that he has to add them all up is almost as chilling as what follows next
About
twenty,  guess
You're lying
No, it's true,  swear
Twenty kids

Yeah
thereabouts
kinda stopped counting after a while, and Gordon said one or two might've gotten away, but -- Nobody can just up and kill twenty kids -- We did
yeah, we did that
How
Sanford looks off, pauses, then, softly and slowly
Most times we'd bring back just one or two
sometimes as many as three
-  - Gordon is at his truck, the same one we saw earlier, checking the engine as Sanford looks on nervously

) always knew when he was getting ready 'cause he'd go through the car and clean it up, make sure the tires were good, the engine
he was always afraid something'd break down and we'd be caught
Gordon slams the hood shut, looks to Sanford
Smiles
Time to go
- kid is walking down the street, playing idly, by himself, as the truck starts to approach from behind
(
) We'd go a different direction every time, never hit the same part of town twice
Sometimes we'd go for hours, just driving around, until we found somebody
The truck comes beside the kid and Gordon leans out the window
True Story                                   70
(
) He'd use all kinds of different stories
Sometimes he'd say he had free tickets for the circus, or he was looking for a lost dog
that one worked real good
Other days -- There you are, we've been looking for you like mad
-: to a different kid, a different street
You have
Sure thing
Your folks, they got in an accident
They sent us to find you
They're hurt real bad
The police took 'em to the hospital, but they didn't have time to come find you, so we said we'd do it
Now come on, hurry
we gotta get to the hospital, see your folks
-: Yet another kid, who hesitates, looks to Sanford
(
) lot of kids won't get in a car alone with a stranger, but when he's got a kid there with him, that made it easier
(beat) They'd look to me, and figure if was safe, they would be too
That's why he needed me, see
It's okay
Come on in
-: Back to the first kid, who takes one last , then gets into the car
(
) Every time they got in the truck, it was like  wanted to die
Good boy
Now hold on, it's a long drive and we gotta fly
And the truck heads off
True Story                                    71
(
) Then, as soon as we got back to the ranch
they went in the coop
-   - The boy, crying, is tossed into the chicken coop
There are two other boys there, also crying and screaming
(
) Some days he'd do 'em right off
Other days, he'd wait, pick up a few more, keep 'em in the coop until he had like four or five, 'cause -- (beat) -- 'cause he liked to hear 'em scream all at once
Like they were some kinda chorus
And then
Gordon, eyes insane with blood lust, stumbles toward the coop
(
) and then
The kids, screaming
Sanford looking on, afraid to move, the single overhead light in the coop swinging wildly
Gordon grabbing an ax
Raising it
On Sanford's eyes, terrified
The ax begins to fall in   and -- -- as the long ash at the end of Ybarra's cigarette, to the floor in  , end over end,  when it hits the floor and bringing us back to full speed
Sometimes
sometimes he'd leave one or two of 'em alive
barely anyway
and tell me
finish 'em
Finish 'em
or 'll finish you
(beat) And  did
did
oh god
oh, sweet Jesus
killed 'em
killed 'em
killed 'em
Then: silence, except for Sanford's sobbing
Ybarra realizes he hasn't been breathing
He tries to find his voice
True Story                                     72
These
uhm
these kids
do you think
if you saw them again, do you think you'd recognize them
(sanford nods) Just a second
He goes to his coat and pulls out a batch of photos of missing kids bound with a rubber band
Hands it to Sanford
haven't updated these in a while, but still, it should be
(beat) Just go through
and if you see any faces you recognize, put it on the table
Sanford takes the photos
Starts going through them
photo, a face, goes down on the table
Then another third
With each photo slapped down the  gets louder, at us
Another photo
Another
Row after row
He's crying, sobbing, but still putting down photos
Then he  down the last one and   half-falls, half-stumbles out of his chair, sobbing
goes to   the corner of the room and slides down the wall until he's   sitting in a fetal position, hands covering his face
Sobbing uncontrollably
Numb, Ybarra goes to the table, picks up a photo
Looks at it
Turns it over to the name, then picks up another
Then a third
When he picks up the fourth photo and turns it over, he stops, staring at it
shit
The name on the back of the photo is
(
) He's lying
'  - Jones is on the phone, pissed and getting more pissed by the moment
between Jones and Ybarra in juvenile hall during the conversation
Have you gone soft in the head, Les
Sir,  -- True Story                                      73
He's playing you
He knows he's in trouble, so he's come up with some cock and bull story about how he was forced to stay in the country -- With all due respect, sir,  don't think so
You didn't see him, the kid's scared half out of his mind -- He picked the Collins kid
We found him, remember
Haven't you been reading the papers
(beat) Or maybe you have, is that it
He backhands a newspaper on his desk, headlined Sir, if you'd just listen -- Just then a secretary sticks her head in the doorway
'm sorry, captain, but he's here again
that reverend, Briegleb
He's asking about Christine Collins
Tell the sonofabitch to get the hell off police property before have him arrested for disturbing the peace
tried
He said he's not leaving
him, or his friends
There's a disturbance off-screen and she goes to deal with it as Jones gets further wound up to ninety
What the hell
He's drawn to the window by the sound of voices
He peeks through the slats
Several dozen placard-carrying parishioners and members of the Women's Temperance League are standing in the street, beating drums and calling Christine's name
Jesus jumped down
He realizes he's still on the phone
True Story                                     74
Ybarra
Listen
You're not to do anything except come back here
Sir, department policy requires that all allegations of homicide have to be investigated
And these are kids, for chrissakes -- Departmental policy is what  say it is, you got that
Now 'm ordering you to get your ass back here with that kid, you got that
You bring him here and you talk to no one, got it
Nobody
He slams the phone down
-- -- Ybarra in juvenile hall, agonizing over this
Finally, his voice resigned, he looks into the interrogation room
All right, let's go
-  - Jones has come out into the hall, where Briegleb, several supporters and a handful of reporters are standing at the receiving officer's desk
They approach quickly
Are you Captain Jones
am
What the hell have you done with Christine Collins
Don't try and lie your way out of it
talked to several neighbors who saw her being driven off in a police car
Mrs
Collins has been placed in protective custody following a mental breakdown
what
True Story                                      75
Her statements and behavior have been found to be consistent with a delusional state of mind that could make her a danger to herself or others
In the public interest, we are looking after her son while she gets the help she clearly needs
Where
Sorry, we're withholding that information to respect the privacy of the family
But  can assure you that she's getting the best treatment available
That's all
He heads back the way he came as the others shout questions after him, held back by other police officers
-   -   - Patients are being corralled into a line that extends to a barred window where a nurse is dispensing pills
Line-up for medication
Line up for medication
Christine is nudged forward by an orderly, Carol beside her
Go on
Move up
What for
Medication
What kind of medication
The kind that's good for you
Help you relax
She's nudged to the window, where a nurse hands out a pill and water
don't want to relax
'm fine, and  won't take something unless know what it is
True Story                                      76
Orderly -- Just listen -- -- we can force-feed it to you if that's what you want
Christine sees Dr
Steele, breaks away and rushes to him
Doctor
Doctor Steele -- heard
don't know what's going on, but 'm not taking anything until -- understand
Come with me
He moves off into an adjoining room
Carol Dexter, next in line, takes her pill
but keeps an eye on Christine
- '  - He goes to his desk as she stands in the doorway
don't have anything wrong with me that  should have to take medication
There's nothing wrong with you
That's right
You're fine
Yes
He pulls a typed letter out of his desk, slides it across
Then you shouldn't have any trouble signing this
She picks it up, reads as he continues: True Story                            77
By signing, you certify that you were wrong when you stated the boy returned by the police was not your son
It further stipulates that the police acted properly in sending you here for observation and absolves them of all responsibility for -- won't sign it
Then your condition is not improved
(beat) Sign it, and you can be out of here first thing tomorrow
won't sign it
She tears up the sheet of paper
was not wrong
That boy is not my son
And  am not going to stop telling the truth about this
And you're not going to stop me, and the police aren't going to stop me -- Mrs
Collins, you're becoming agitated
--  will tear down the walls of this place with my bare hands if have to, but one way or another -- Orderly
An orderly appears in the doorway
The patient is disturbed, hyperactive and is threatening the staff
See to it she is properly sedated
No
She  past the orderly, running into True Story                                     78
-   -  - running, pursued by orderlies, two more blocking her way
No,  won't let you
Someone, please, help me
They  her and bring her down
She struggles as the others look on, and you can see in their eyes that they don't like what they're seeing, there's rage -- -- and a furious Carol Dexter comes to her aid
She into the struggle
Biting
Kicking
Scratching
Steele comes on the run just as the orderlies peel Carol off the fight, spinning her around to face Steele, who  her
Stay out of this
This is none of your business
(to the rest) This is police business
You'll stay out of it if you know what's good for you
He looks to Carol, Christine restrained behind them
You'd think you had enough trouble with the law just being a whore, wouldn't you
He smiles
She gets a hand free and  him, hard, a nail slicing his cheek
He touches his face
It comes back with blood
Then he looks to the orderly
Attacking a staff member
Room eighteen
Electro-convulsive therapy
The orderly hauls Carol off, kicking and screaming, as Christine is moved toward the nurse's station
Carol
No, leave her alone
What're you -- They force a pill in her mouth, following with water as they hold her nose, forcing her to swallow
She chokes, swallows
They march her down the hall as Steele returns to his office
Carol
True Story                                   79
- The electro-shock room
Carol struggles against the orderlies who force her down onto the gurney
nurse behind her applies conductor jelly to her temples as another orderly shoves a rubber bite-guard into her mouth
Then a pair of metal pincers, points covered in cloth, are pressed against her temples
button is pushed
and her body goes  as a jolt of electricity blasts through her body
(This was, remember, fairly common practice for violent behavior in the 1920s
) Then she passes out, her eyes rolling up in her head
- Christine is peering out the narrow slot in her door as she sees Carol being wheeled down the hall and put into her bed
Christine, sobbing, collapses slowly to the floor, caught in a nightmare and unable to wake up
: - Detective Ybarra is sitting at his desk, not happy about a lot of his life at this moment
He's turning over the photos of the missing kids identified by Sanford Clark and arranging them on his desk the way you might arrange cards, playing solitaire
He looks up -- -- to see Sanford being led out of one of the holding areas, hands cuffed, clothes in his hands
Being transferred to a waiting bus
The two exchange a look
Ybarra looks away
Sanford continues toward the bus
Finally, in agony, Ybarra can't take it any more
He rises, goes to the officer standing by the door to the bus
It's all right, 'll take it from here
But -- We need him for questioning
Come on
He leads Sanford away, then stops two passing officers
True Story                                      80
You two
you've just been requisitioned for backup
'll explain on the way
He hurries off
The officers follow, not sure what's up
- Christine sits beside Carol's bed
She's awake but dazed
Christine dabs a wet cloth against her forehead
You shouldn't have done that
(with difficulty) Wanted
to
Felt
good
Carol takes her hand, holds it
lost
two babies
to back alley doctors
no choice
(beat) Never had
the chance
to fight for them
You do
Don't stop
won't
won't
Fuck them
and the horse
they rode in on
Christine manages a thin smile, despite her tears
That's hardly appropriate language for a lady, now is it
Hell, yeah
there are times
that's exactly the right thing to say
And when's that
When you've got
nothing left to lose
Christine touches her face, and we know she's heard this
: True Story                                     81
- Two squad cars pull up to the ranch
Ybarra and the other officers get out, guns up, not knowing if Gordon is still there or not
:  12, 1928 They move quickly through the area, checking the house
Everything's dark, silent
One officer runs into the house, there's a long pause
then he pokes his head out again
All clear
Ybarra goes back to the car, opens the door
Sanford emerges
All right
Show me
Sanford hesitates, then starts toward a nearby barn
- He slides the door open and walks to the far end
The dirt here is a strange white-yellow color
Ybarra follows, still keeping a wary eye out for trouble
He looks down at where Sanford has stopped
Several bags marked  are nearby
This it
You're sure
Sanford nods
Ybarra edges toward a shovel, hands it to him
Dig
(off sanford's look) You put 'em in the ground, you can take 'em out of the ground
Go on
Sanford takes the shovel and starts cutting out sections of dirt and lye, dust rising around them
Ybarra watches, pensively, as the other officers edge their way in
He's looking the other way when one of the officers reacts: Holy god
Ybarra glances back
to see a child's shoe being unearthed
And beside it
bones
And then
a skull
Call it in
get the coroner and every officer in a twenty mile radius here inside the hour
(more) True Story                                      82
(Cont'd) Then put out an  on Gordon Stewart Northcott, the info is in my car
Go on
The officer races out of the barn as Ybarra looks to Sanford, who is still digging, crying as he goes
You can stop now, son
(he doesn't) You can stop now
It's over
We can take it from here
It's over
Sobbing, Sanford drops the shovel and collapses on the ground, hands covering his face, crying in great, heaving sobs
: -   -  - The patients are lined up outside their rooms for inspection
Steele passes down them in review
Stops in front of Christine, who looks exhausted, worn, pale, her eyes bloodshot
but still defiant
He glances to the orderlies
Privacy, please
The orderlies move all of the other patients away, except for Christine, who shares a glance with Carol
Several other orderlies remain
He glances at her chart in his hands
see you've still been refusing medication, requiring force-feeding
see they switched to a rubber tube
hear that can quite uncomfortable
She doesn't answer
Her eyes never leave his
He pulls another copy of the letter out of the folder
Six days, Mrs
Collins, and no progress
We may have to go to more
strenuous therapies
(beat) Unless you're willing to prove you're doing better
by signing this
He holds it up in front of her
She focuses first on it, then on him
and finally, her spine where it needs to be even if the rest of her is in shambles, looks at him and says: True Story                                    83
Fuck you
and the horse
you rode in on
He nods, shrugs, puts the letter back in the folder
Turns to the orderlies
Room eighteen
They  her and start muscling her down the hall, Christine kicking and screaming as they go
Steele continues out to -   - where he comes through the double-barred door just as Gustav Briegleb charges in the front door, carrying a newspaper
Sir, please -- '
Steele approaches
'm head doctor on duty
What's the problem
You the doctor who's got Christine Collins locked up in here
Intercut with: - They wheel Christine into the room, struggling, fighting against the straps that pin her to the gurney
-   - Steele turns away from Briegleb, unconcerned
Sorry, we don't discuss our cases with anyone other than family -- You'll damned well discuss this one with me
True Story                                       84
Sir -- Briegleb  the newspaper into Steele's hands
Read it
Read it, damn you
Steele unfolds the paper, looks at the headline, which we don't see
His reaction, though, is ominous and serious
- The nurse behind Christine applies the conductor jell to her temples
She's fighting the best she can, but it's hopeless
The nurse picks up the electro-shock pincers
Places them on Christine's temples
Reaches for the button -- -- as suddenly the door opens, and a nurse steps in, stopping the process
The nurse goes to the one at the controls, whispers in her ear
The nurse then says something quietly to the orderly, who starts to undo the straps that hold Christine to the gurney
The doctor wants to see you
They pull her up off the gurney
- '  - Christine is ushered inside, where Steele is waiting
He looks upset about something
Mrs
Collins
She forces herself to stand straight, not easy given what she's just been through
He approaches
One last time
Are you, or are you not, prepared to sign that letter
She looks up into his face, her resolve unshaken, her voice dry but firm for: No
He studies her for one last , then turns his back
You're free to go
True Story                                      85
Christine takes a moment to process this
not sure if she heard this right, or if it's a trick
what
Your clothes are in the next room
You can change there
She hesitates a second, looks to the orderly, being careful in case this is a set-up
Next door
That's right
(to the orderly) See to it
The orderly nods
She takes one last look around, then gets the hell out of the room
Alone, Steele picks up the newspaper that had been laying face-down on his desk, looks at it, and shakes his head
Christ
-   -   - Carol is there as Christine, now in her regular clothes, comes dashing in
Carol sees her, goes to her
You're getting out
am out
How -- don't know
but  couldn't go without saying goodbye -- Christine, don't be stupid, get out of here fast in case they change their mind
will
but  want you to know: once  have my boy back, 'm coming (more) True Story                                     86
(Cont'd) back here
for you, and the others
This is wrong, and we can stop it -- You are crazy
Watch me
They hug
Christine breaks the hug, and hurries away as Carol looks on, crying
-   - Christine comes to the area where she was checked in
No one is looking at her
She passes the nurse's station and heads toward the door
Opens it
Fresh air comes in
Freedom
She steps out the front door as -- -- a moment later, Briegleb passes through the hallway with an admissions official, having not seen her
You give me every piece of paper you've got on this case, you hear me
Every piece
The official moves on, nervous, as Briegleb looks to the receiving nurse
When does she come down
Before she can answer, we jump out to - Where Christine walks among the sidewalk traffic
Free
Vindicated
She starts to pass a news-stand, where a is calling out headlines, peddling papers
Hurricane hits West Palm Beach
Babe Ruth hits 53rd home run
Kids found murdered in Riverside
The last line stops Christine
just a bad sense that grows as she turns to the news vendor, who keeps on going

True Story                                   87
Christine's knees buckle as she hears this
She starts to go down as Briegleb runs toward her from the hospital
Mrs
Collins
Christine
No
god
no
And she collapses into his arms, sobbing uncontrollably, as passers-by glance over at her
and continue walking
'm sorry
didn't want you to find out like this
'm sorry
'm sorry
But they're just words
She doesn't hear them
-  - Captain Jones is pacing nervously in the hallway for a long when another officer steps out of an office with a brass nameplate that reads
The chief will see you now
Jones straightens his tie and steps into '  - lots of dark wood and filtered light
Davis is sitting at his desk, looking at a series of newspapers in front of him as Jones steps up and stands before the desk
don't know if you're aware of it, Captain, but  have an exceptionally good vocabulary
'm a terror at Scrabble, crossword puzzles, but even 'm in awe of the vocabulary that the press and the city council have been exercising in reference to this department courtesy of the Christine Collins
incident
(scans papers) Incompetent
Cowardly
Bullying
Reprehensible
Mendacious and invidious
those two courtesy of that prick Gustav Briegleb
Bonus words in Scrabble, both of them
Especially invidious
Hard to work that one into a conversation
But he managed it, all right
True Story                                   88
Sir,  -- The key, of course, is the context in which words like this get used
You have to do that in scrabble, you know, when somebody challenges a word
show how it's used in a sentence
So "incompetent," as in -- (reads) " department so incompetent that they never realized that up to twenty children were being kidnapped and murdered under their very noses
" (looks over) And here: "So incompetent that they insisted they knew better than a mother the identity of her own child, forced him upon her, and then incarcerated her when she confronted them with evidence of their own reprehensible behavior
" That was a two-fer
Incompetent and reprehensible in the same sentence
Guy must be a real terror at crossword puzzles
Davis gets up and crosses the room, looking out through the slatted windows at the busy Los Angeles street outside
Captain, your handling of the Collins case has exposed this department to public ridicule
There is even the potential for civil and criminal liability
Sir, nobody could have known what was going on up at that ranch
Not us, not the Sheriff's Department, the Marshall's Office
as for the Collins woman
(beat) 'm still not convinced that her kid is among the victims up in Wineville
No
No, sir
(more) True Story                                     89
(Cont'd) There were four other photos of missing boys that looked a lot like him
this Clark kid could have been mistaken
Maybe he was
which raises the obvious question: so what
Sir
Davis turns back to him from the window
The Mayor wants this to go away want this to go away
The way you do that is to stop insisting that Walter Collins was not among those kids killed up at that goddamned ranch
Because if the boy you brought back isn't Walter Collins, and he's not dead up at that ranch, then where the hell is he
People will want to know why we haven't found him
Why we aren't we doing our job
(beat) But if, on the other hand, he is, or could be among those poor boys killed up in Wineville
then the inquiries stop
It's a momentary embarrassment that you'll have to live with
but better a short inconvenience than a lingering problem, wouldn't you say, Captain
Jones doesn't like it, but he swallows his pride
Nods
Yes, sir
The boy's been gone for nearly a year
If he was going to be found, it would've happened by now
Whether he was up at that ranch or not, the truth is he probably is dead somewhere
Better his mother accepts that now rather than later, don't you think
Yes, sir
True Story                                   90
Good
That'll be all, Captain
Jones starts to leave, then looks back as Davis settles back behind his desk
Sir, there's talk of an investigation by the police commission
Let me worry about the commission
But it wouldn't hurt to find out just who the fuck that kid is you brought back from De Kalb and why he did this, because the press bought into his bullshit same as we did
That we were all taken in by the scheming little bastard may help take some of the sting off this
My boys are working on it now, sir
And he exits as we go to - Detective Ybarra is sitting on one side of a table, a notepad in front of him, staring across at "Walter," who isn't very happy right now, and is staring back with substantial venom
His true, nasty personality is free to come out at last
There's a long , then: "" want a glass of water
Tough
"" (mocking) "Tough
" What's your name
"" Walter Collins
Walter Collins is dead
"" (shrugs) didn't do it
True Story                                   91
Look, let me explain something to you
Because of your lies, you've ruined a woman's life embarrassed the police department, and got the whole city up in arms over this
"Walter" considers this for a , then smiles
"" Got a lot done, didn't
Ybarra exchanges a look with the matron, then closes up his notepad
All right, if that's how you want it, then  guess we're done here
(to matron) Tell County Jail we're remanding him for trial
"" Wait
what's remanding
What trial
told you, the real Walter Collins was murdered
"" So
didn't do anything
wasn't even here when it happened
By pretending to be Walter Collins, you're interfering in a police investigation of a kidnapping and murder
We can try you as an accomplice to murder after the fact
(beat) Too bad
County Jail is a lot worse than juvenile hall or a foster home
lot worse
"" You can't do that
'm just a kid
Sanford Clark is a kid, too
Fifteen
But he's going to jail
All murderers and their accomplices go to jail
Everyone knows that

It's out of my hands now

He heads for the door when "Walter" cries out, scared
"" Wait

Prove it
And on the boy's face, we : (
) Arthur Hutchins
'  - Ybarra is standing in the doorway to Jones' office, speaking to the Captain and looking at his notepad
The boy's real name is Arthur Hutchins Junior, age twelve, a runaway from Cedar Rapids, Iowa
Did you check the wire services
Ybarra holds up a missing persons sheet
Checks out
The report was filed by his divorced mother, who lives in Clinton, Iowa with the boy's grandmother
Apparently he didn't like living with the old lady, she didn't let him get away with the stuff he usually got away with, and one day
he up and left
What about the man he showed up with at the diner
Just some drifter
The boy was hungry, ran into this guy who said he knew how to get some food and not have to pay for it
Only when they finished, he left the kid behind while he cut out
When the police picked him up, they started going through the wire reports about missing kids -- And he overheard them say the name Walter Collins
True Story                                    93
Bingo
But why that one
mean, of all the police departments he could've screwed up, why Los Angeles
asked him the same question
- Moments earlier
on "Walter" for: "" knew that Los Angeles was where they made the Tom Mix movies
figured maybe  could meet Tom Mix
Maybe he'd even let me ride his horse

Briegleb enters and approaches a nearby chair
How are you feeling
little better, thanks
The sleep helped
Anything new outside
Nothing that can't wait until you're stronger
The police still have a car parked outside
They want to know what your next move is
want to go home
And then
She takes a , then slowly, gingerly gets out of bed
True Story                                   94
've been giving that a great deal of thought ever since  got out of that
place
All those women, and what they did about Walter
(beat) They're going to just keep on doing it, aren't they
Nothing's going to change
unless we make it change
She glances out the window, to the police car parked across the street
used to tell Walter, "Never start a fight
but always finish it
" didn't start this fight
but by god 'm going to finish it
It's dangerous, and you've already been through a great deal, Mrs
Collins
Right now you're sufficiently high-profile that the police will hesitate to come after you out in the open
but if they see their position threatened, that could change quickly
(beat) Your life could be in danger
She takes a beat, then turns to him from the window
"Always finish it
Always
" -  - series of red-brick rowhouses line a quiet street
We see couples walking, hand in hand, kids playing
then we notice Gordon Northcott coming around the corner
He looks around, then cuts across a yard, jumping over a fence to get to -   - where  , 30s, is doing dishes as the doorbell rings
Just a minute
She opens the door and finds Gordon Northcott standing outside
Hi, sis
There's a flicker of a pause
was she expecting him
True Story                                    95
Gordon
didn't know you were back in town
Got in a couple of days ago, figured 'd surprise you
That okay
Yes
yes, of course
Come on in
She steps aside as he enters, looks around
Where's that little niece of mine
She
went into town
Should be back this evening
Bob's here -- Good
Need to talk to him about staying on for a few days
Staying -- Listen, can  use your bathroom
It's been a long ride and  could use a shower
Of course
He passes her and heads upstairs
She steps to the back of the house, where her husband, , is coming in through the back, wiping engine grease off his hands with a towel
Is that -- (she nods, scared) Go next door
'll call the police
Hurry
She rushes past him into the other room to do just that
-  - Gordon is toweling off his hair when he hears a car door slam shut
Then another
He peers out the window
Several Royal Canadian Mounted Police cars have pulled up along the street
Mounties are getting out, moving quietly toward the house
True Story                                     96
- Bob quietly lets the Mounties in
They signal for Bob to get the hell out of there
Guns in hand, they climb the stairs
Suddenly there's the  of breaking glass from above
They race up the stairs to find the window broken, and Gordon fleeing across an adjoining rooftop
Go around the other side
Cut him off
The others take off as he and another Mountie climb through the broken window in pursuit of Northcott
- Gordon races up one rooftop, over the top, then leaps to the next one as, below, Mounties race to keep up with him, blowing furiously
He looks behind him to see the other two Mounties running rooftop to rooftop, coming fast
Gordon runs faster, going at angles to put more distance between himself and the police on the ground
and making increasingly more difficult and dangerous leaps from rooftop to rooftop
He leaps across one chasm, barely makes it, keeps running
The rooftop Mounties follow
One of them makes the jump successfully, but the other falls short, plummeting to the ground three stories below
leg snaps on impact
The first Mountie hesitates, looks down
The second one waves him on
Go on
Get the bastard
He nods and continues the chase
Gordon runs for all he's worth
The Mountie keeps after him
Gordon makes another leap
The Mountie jumps
but he's short
He grabs onto a rain gutter
Gordon sees his situation, runs back, and  on the Mountie's hands, trying to get him to shake loose
The gutter starts to tear free -- -- when a Mountie down below  at Gordon, making him back off
The Mountie clinging to the gutter starts to fall, then grabs a nearby pipe and crawls up to the roof
Keeps coming
Gordon keeps running
but comes to a chasm too wide to be jumped
He hesitates, starts to cut back in another direction -- -- when the Mountie  him hard
The two go down in a tangle of limbs, fighting, punching, kicking
True Story                                   97
They  down the steeply angled roof and barely avoid going over the edge
With nowhere else to run, Gordon fights for all he's got, the punches from both coming fast and furious
Finally, the Mountie backs off just a bit -- Screw this
'm too old for this fightin' shit
-- and  at Gordon, taking them both off the edge of the two-story roof and  into -- -- a garden below,  through carefully manicured flowers and trees to land with a , the Mountie's impact cushioned by Gordon
As the other Mounties come on the run, the first one staggers to his feet and yanks up a bruised, bleeding but otherwise intact Gordon
Looks at him nose-to-nose
And he  Gordon toward the other waiting officers

Mrs
Collins,  want you to meet a friend of mine, Mr
Hahn
Hello
Mrs
Collins
My deepest condolences on your loss
Can we come in
Yes
of course
She steps aside to let them in, closing the door under: Mr
Hahn, was it
Yes

appreciate the sentiment, but so far they still haven't positively identified any of the
remains
as Walter's
But he was identified, was he not
Yes, but
guess  still can't accept it
It doesn't feel real to me
It never does

There's not a day goes by  don't think, should mention this to Claudine
then  remember she's not here
'm sorry
Please, sit
They do as Christine looks to Briegleb
've been on the phone all day with the appointment secretary for the police commission
They won't let me testify at the hearing, or call witnesses
They say it's not necessary
know
My sources tell me the police commission is going to come out with a report that whitewashes the whole thing
They're going to say that Jones and the rest of the did absolutely nothing wrong, that the real blame is with the kid
and with you, for being difficult and forcing them to put you away for your own safety
Then we'll just have to hire a lawyer

Too risky, they said
So finally  went to the very best attorney in town, a man who's sued the city four times and won
Unfortunately, we could never afford to hire him

Which is why 'm doing this pro bono
(a smile) It would be my honor to defend your honor, Mrs
Collins
In my fifteen years as a lawyer,  have never seen anyone fight as long or as hard as you have, in what is so clearly in the cause of justice
Now  want you to tell Mr
Hahn here the whole story, from end to end, leave nothing out, he'll need it all if he's going to get the City Council involved
Of course
One thing, though personal favor
When we've finished here today, could you spare a few minutes to come with me downtown
Of course
Where downtown

He goes to the receiving nurse
Yes

'm sorry, but the doctor in charge won't be in until tomorrow morning and -- Let me be clearer
Either you open those doors and produce the people named in that court order, or you will find yourself on the other side of those bars
without a key
The nurse exchanges a sour look with Christine and heads off
- One by one, the Code Twelve patients are brought out of the hospital and into the light
One of the last to emerge is Carol Dexter, who blinks against the light, and sees Christine
She runs to her, embraces her, sobbing
knew you'd come
knew you'd come back
knew you'd come
It's all right
everything's going to be all right now
And in Christine's face, we see a flicker of pride and one simple truth: if she could not save her son, she could at least save these women

If we take him out of the picture for a while, it might help calm things down until the hearing's finished

Cryer shakes his head, walks off a pace
Our friends in the press are having a field day with this mess

do
And you know where  stand
So the question is
are we going to stand together
or hang together
He lets the question sit as we go to - Mayor Cryer stands beside Chief Davis and addresses a rather noisy and worked-up press corps from behind a podium
Gentlemen
gentlemen, please
As Mayor of Los Angeles, it is my duty to preserve the peace in our city, which has been disrupted by recent events in the case of Christine Collins
As a result, we have decided that Captain
Jones of the Lincoln Heights Division is to be suspended from active duty, effective immediately
What's the charge, Chief
The charge is conduct unbecoming an officer, and using improper and abusive language toward Mrs
Collins
It further charges that he exceeded his authority as a police officer by incarcerating Mrs
Collins on the alleged charge of insanity without sufficient cause
Mayor Cryer, are you aware that the City Council has said it plans to open its own investigation into the Collins case
've heard this, yes
But since one of the main purposes of such a hearing by the City Council would be to suspend Captain Jones, and since that action has now been taken, the question is moot
Which makes it look like the only reason Jones is being suspended is to head off the City Council (more) True Story                                    104
(Cont'd) investigation
Are you concerned that an outside investigation might go uncomfortably high up the food chain
won't even dignify that question with a response
Good day
The two head back into -  - Glancing back over their shoulders at the press outside
Cheer up, Chief
That little show should take the wind out of their sails
By Monday, this issue will be as cold as yesterday's fish
Never underestimate the public's lack of attention and potential for apathy
Old news is dead news, you'll see
: '  - She opens the door as Briegleb enters with three really large, dangerous looking men, one of whom is carrying a heavy trench coat
Reverend, what -- Sorry to barge in so late, Mrs
Collins, but it took me a while to find the right people for the right job
These three gentlemen are members of my congregation who, before coming to the Lord, had lived lives of brutality, vice and crime
Now they are pledged to doing god's work
and if this isn't it,  don't know what is

(Cont'd) disappearing right before the trial
'm a big believer in the power of prayer, Mrs
Collins
but a little backup from time to time never hurts
The others nod as they make themselves comfortable in the living room
see
well,
thank you
Can get you anything
Since we don't plan on sleeping, coffee would be lovely
She heads off to get some coffee
As one of the men puts his coat behind the sofa, we see that it contains a sawed-off shotgun
Briegleb looks out the window, to where a police car sits, watching the house
: '  - She's dressed in her best dress, putting on a hat and a pair of gloves
Her hands are shaking
She squeezes them together, closes her eyes
Focuses
With one final, deep breath, she heads out
- The same police car is there as Christine gets into a car with Briegleb and the two drive off
The other three men get into another car and follow
The police car in turn pulls away from the curb, following both cars
- '  - He's aware that they're being followed, glancing in the rear view mirror to keep an eye on things
Looks over to Christine, smiles encouragingly
Looks ahead
Traffic's getting heavy
We'll go up Spring
He turns
The other cars do the same
But the traffic here is even worse
Just then, Briegleb looks back in his rear view mirror to see -- -- another police car pulling out of a driveway and cutting off the car with Christine's bodyguards
True Story                                  106
Briegleb turns quickly, trying to get ahead, but the street's too busy
He looks in the mirror to see that another police car glide into position two cars behind them
Traffic stops
Jammed
Briegleb is nervous, sensing the very real possibility of a hit being set up
The traffic is lined right up against parked cars on either side
Then there's a momentary break in traffic
Hold on
He turns hard into the driveway of a closed shop and shuts off the engine
Jumps out and opens the door for Christine, who gets out
Start walking
Quickly
They do
He glances back at the police car
The two inside start to open the doors, but they can't get them open, being right up against parked cars on one side and traffic on the other
They run the siren to clear traffic, but it's too late as -- -- Christine and Briegleb hurry down the street on foot, Briegleb glancing behind them
The foot- and car-traffic is very heavy
we  horns honking and, in the distance, something that could be the sound of lots of people
Almost there
Just a few more blocks
Where is all this traffic's coming from
Briegleb glances back
The police car has popped its doors, and two trench-coated officers are getting out
Christine stops a man passing in the opposite direction
Excuse me, can you tell me what the problem is up ahead
Didn't you hear
It's the biggest protest 've ever seen
Protest
Yeah
over that Collins broad, if you can believe that
True Story                                    107
He moves on
Briegleb and Collins slowly exchange a look somewhere between disbelief and "oh shit
" He didn't mean
he couldn't mean -- don't know
all  know is that think  just stopped breathing
They walk quickly up one clogged street and down another, the police following on foot
moving toward the  of voices, drums, and cars honking
until they turn onto Spring Street -- -- and find themselves in the middle of the biggest protest march ever recorded in the history of Los Angeles to this date
Thousands of people crowd into the street, overwhelming the police presence
not rioting, but making their voices heard
The Salvation Army, the Women's Temperance Society, the Society for Justice, Catholic groups, Union groups and ordinary citizens carrying placards and signs that read and
and  : '
it just goes on and on and on
Christine looks out to see her boss from the telephone company, Mr
Harris, marching arm in arm with the rest
He sees her, smiles, tips his hat and continues marching
Christine is stunned
Briegleb even moreso
Oh
my
The Lord works in mysterious ways, Mrs
Collins
He looks behind them, to where the police have stopped
There's no way in hell they can make a move in the face of something as big as t his
Briegleb smiles
Boy howdy, does He ever
Come on
They continue up the street toward City Hall
(
) Ladies and Gentlemen
can  have your attention, please
- This is a big room, and one thousand observers fill every available chair with more standing along the wall in back
It's a circus
Christine sits with Hahn
True Story                                     108
Briegleb is in a seat behind the main section pop as , a city councilman, speaks
:  24, 1928 There are nearly one thousand people gathered in this chamber, more than have ever been in this room before
-   - Speakers are lowered from the window into the parking lot where hundreds of others are gathered to listen
(on pa) therefore ask you to refrain from demonstrations of any kind
We're all here because we want to find out the real facts in this case, and everybody is going to be heard if we have to sit here for a week
As Thorpe looks to the other members of the Council, and the area where witnesses are supposed to wait to be called upon
number of seats are empty
Mr
Thorpe,  don't see any other members of the Police Commission
That's odd
we specifically stipulated that we would begin our hearings with testimony from the police department
Are there any representatives of the Police Commission in the room
(no answer) Is Chief Davis here
(no reply) Is Captain Jones here
Is there anyone here representing the police

Mr
Chairman

Both the Police Chief and Captain Jones are in San Pedro for a police inspection at a station there
(more) True Story                                    109
(Cont'd) Only reason  know is we have a couple of our boys out covering the thing
Are you telling me they directly violated the wishes of the City Council
That they refused to attend a vital hearing so they could conduct a routine inspection in San Pedro
And what the hell is Jones doing at an inspection after being suspended
(beat) hate to call a recess before we've even started, but  think a few phone calls are in order
So we'll take a half hour break, then continue with the witnesses who have appeared here today
But let it be known that Captain Jones and Police Chief Davis will be subpoenaed and required to appear here tomorrow morning
There's  from the crowd which breaks up into pockets of discussion as a  approaches Hahn and whispers into his ear
Hahn nods, looks to Christine
Mrs
Collins, could you come across the street with me for just a moment
But
shouldn't we -- think there's something you should see
Puzzled, curious, Christine gets up and exits with Hahn
-    - Hahn is moving quickly down the hall toward a courtroom door, Christine following
-- the police decided it was best to keep this off the main docket in order to avoid exactly the sort of chaos we have across the street
He gets to the door, pauses
Looks back to her
She nods
He opens the door and they enter True Story                                  110
- Dead silence, in marked contrast to the city council room
As she enters, she sees people sitting silently in the gallery
row after row of couples, mothers and fathers, some weeping softly
Some of them notice Christine's entrance and nod to her with sadness and a strange sense of common bond
they are all carrying the same grief
One of the couples,
, see Christine and go to her, speaking softly
They should be distinct enough in appearance that we will recognize them instantly when we see them again later
Mrs
Collins
'm Leanne Clay, this is my husband, John
just wanted to pass on my sympathies
What we went through, waiting to hear anything about our son David, was bad enough, and now this
(beat) But there was no call for what the police did to you
no call at all
She nods her thanks as a door at the other end of the courtroom opens
They take their seats as a judge and two attorneys take their places, preceded by a bailiff
All rise
They do
The judge takes his seat
The rest of the room also sits
He nods to the bailiff, who in turn opens another door, leading to the holding area
As Christine looks on, Gordon Stewart Northcott is ushered into the courtroom for his initial plea
Some women break into tears at the sight of him
He first seems startled by the presence of so many, then he smiles
An audience
As he takes his place beside his attorney, he looks down the room and meets the gaze of Christine Collins
Her face pales, as though slapped
but she doesn't look away
Hey
saw you in the papers
You got a lot of moxie, standing up to the police like that
The bailiff forcibly turns him around to face the judge
Christine's hands grip the seat she's in until her knuckles turn white
but she doesn't allow him the satisfaction of seeing her react to his comments
The judge looks up
True Story                                  111
Gordon Stewart Northcott, you have been charged with three counts of murder in the first degree, with an additional seventeen counts under review by the district attorney's office
How do you plea
Not guilty, your honor
He glances back at his audience
The bailiff rights him again
In light of the defendant's penchant for international travel, no bail will be set
This court will receive preliminary motions by tomorrow morning, with a trial date to be set for the earliest opening on the court's calendar
(beat) The defendant is remanded into custody
Bailiff
The bailiff removes Gordon, who shares one last look with his audience, and Christine in particular
He winks at her
She doesn't give him a flicker of satisfaction with a reaction
But once he's gone, she sits heavily and covers her eyes, fighting tears
Hahn puts a hand on her shoulder, but says nothing
There's nothing to say
(
) The boy, Walter Collins, was reported as missing on March 10, 1928
- Jones is at last on the stand
Hahn stands before him, the rest of the City Council, Christine and the huge audience looking on
We then instituted a nationwide search
On July 10, we received a cable indicating that a boy matching his description had been found in De Kalb, Illinois
Upon questioning, he admitted to being Walter Collins, and we made arrangements to transport him back to California
Where Mrs
Collins told you the boy was not her son
True Story                                      112
Yes
She denied his identity in spite of all evidence pointing to the contrary
But as subsequent events have demonstrated, she was correct
So what prompted you to send her for psychological evaluation
Whether or not this was in fact the correct boy was not relevant to my decision
Throughout this period, she acted strangely
She was often cool, aloof and unemotional, especially when presented with the boy we located in De Kalb, and in our subsequent conversations
It was because of her disturbing behavior that  submitted her for observation to the psychopathic ward of Los Angeles County General Hospital
Just like that
You snap your fingers and an innocent woman is thrown into the psycho ward
She wasn't -- Hahn turns away, playing to the council and the audience
Every home in this state is in grave danger when a Police Captain can take a woman into his office and, five minutes later, have her thrown into the psychopathic ward on his own authority
The crowd applauds and cheers
Joes fights to be heard
(over the crowd) She wasn't -- What was that, Captain
She wasn't thrown
She was
escorted
True Story                                    113
There's laughter from the gallery
He doesn't like it
Escorted, thrown, the verb doesn't matter, Captain
What does matter is that her incarceration was ordered without a warrant
Hahn goes to the exhibit table, picks up several papers
am holding a carbon copy of the affidavit of insanity that was issued in the case of the State of California vs
Christine Collins
Who signed the affidavit
did
And what is the date on this document
September 12th
But Mrs
Collins was incarcerated on September 6th
The form is backdated
Yes, so it would appear
The bottom of the page is reserved for recording where and when the warrant was served
But it has not been filled in
May  assume from this that the warrant was never served
That's correct
There was no need to serve the warrant since she was at that time already in custody
Let me see if  have this straight
woman was thrown into the psychopathic ward without a warrant, because no warrant existed, and when it was finally written six days later, there was no need to sign it or go to a judge because (more) True Story                                      114
(Cont'd) she was already in the asylum
Is this correct, Captain
Technically
yes
More murmuring from the crowd
Extraordinary steps were necessary because we were dealing with an extraordinary situation
Is it our fault that we were being deceived by the boy who claimed to be Walter Collins
No
In light of his claims and her behavior, who wouldn't begin to wonder if there was something wrong with her
Because she questioned you
Because she wouldn't listen, because she insisted on being obstinate and taking matters into her own hands best left to qualified officers, because -- Because she was fighting for the life of her son
boy who may have still been alive while you were wasting valuable time denying you had done anything wrong
This silences both Jones and the crowd
You could hear a pin drop
Hahn approaches Jones, and now speaks softly
And in the end, that's what happened, isn't it
At some point, while all this was going on, Walter Collins died along with as many as nineteen other youths on the Northcott Ranch in Wineville
Is that correct, Captain
Jones looks to Chief Davis
It's a moment
Then: Yes
It is
Christine's face falls into her hands
The place erupts
True Story                                  115
No further questions
Hahn walks away from a devastated looking Jones
- small crowd is assembled at the front of the station, where Chief Davis stands with the Boy who had been "Walter" as a train pulls up before them
-- so after much effort, we were able to identify this boy, who was has been responsible for so much recent trouble, as Arthur Hutchins of Cedar Rapids, Iowa
Between this, and the arrest of the man suspected of murdering the real Walter Collins, we have cleared up two of the biggest mysteries in the history of Los Angeles
(beat) hope that you gentlemen of the press will give as much space to the good things we do as the mistakes that are made on rare occasions
Just then, he turns as a Matron comes off the train with , middle thirties, the boy's mother
Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce you to the boy's real mother, Mrs
Janet Hutchins
She goes to him and hugs him
"Walter" looks like he wishes he were somewhere on Mars
Davis moves closer to them to be in frame while the  pop
She's in the same pose as they got Christine to take when she "accepted" her lost son
hope he hasn't been too much trouble for you
Oh, no, not at all
He towsels the boy's head like he'd like to cut it off
Then he nods to an aide, who approaches with a bundle of clothes
Mrs
Hutchins
Mrs
Collins, the woman he was staying with, wanted him to have these
They're the clothes she let him wear
True Story                                    116
Well, thank you
Isn't that nice, Arthur
Tell the nice officer thank you
"" don't want 'em
Give 'em to somebody else
Precocious little fellow, isn't he
"" It's not my fault
It was the police
They said  was Walter Collins, not me
It wasn't my idea
She yanks him away
Davis smiles gamely at the reporters

We've seen a lot of that lately, haven't we

Christine on the stand, speaking quietly
Officer Ybarra on the stand
Chief Davis on the stand
The murder jury being shown photographs of the Northcott ranch
Walter's dentist showing a drawing of Walter's teeth
His teacher, Mrs
Fox, also testifying
Bits of clothing entered into evidence
Dr
Steele testifying
Ending on Christine seated, reserved, holding it all in

We  on her face to bring us into -- '  - Christine is sitting on Walter's bed
She runs a hand along the sheets, straightening and smoothing them out, her eyes moist but not crying
We  a knock on the front door downstairs, and the door opening
True Story                                  117
'm up here, Reverend
She continues as Briegleb comes up the stairs and enters the room
Sees her
Takes off his hat
show of sympathy
When Walter was
when he was here, 'd walk past his bedroom when he was asleep, and even if  couldn't see him, or hear him,  could
feel him in here
Mothers and their children are connected in amazing ways
My uncle joined the army during the big war, and the day he died, before we ever heard a word about it, my grandmother woke up in the middle of the night and said, "Bobby's gone
" She just
knew
Christine nods, taking it in, then: That's why  don't think Walter is dead
can still feel him, in this room
Mrs
Collins -- know what the police said
But the remains
what they found on that ranch is so
most of it can't even be properly identified
What if that boy made a mistake when he picked Walter's picture
understand that you don't want to accept this
What mother does
But you have to let go
and start over
For yourself
He'd want you to move on
Maybe
And maybe he'd want me to keep looking
Maybe he's waiting for me, somewhere
He is, Christine

(Cont'd) In that place where we will all be reunited with our loved ones someday
And on that day, he will know, front to back, end to end, heart and soul
that you did everything you could, Christine
Everything
She nods absently, finishes adjusting the sheets
He checks his watch
We should go
She nods again, and stands
He heads out of the room, and she lingers for a moment, taking one last look around before turning off the night-light, and sees the drawing he made of the two of them walking together beneath an orange sun on that image as we  a gavel hammering and: (
) This meeting will now come to order
- on Thorpe, at the center of the council's long table, addressing the crowd and Christine
This Committee has now heard all of the testimony, and in light of the facts presented, issues the following statement
- Where Northcott stands before the judge, jury, and the grieving family members
Mr
Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict
We have, your honor
- Still pushing in
While the City Council has no power to directly remove commissioners or (more) True Story                                     119
(Cont'd) the employees who serve under them, it nevertheless can perform the function of making recommendations
This committee therefore reports and recommends: (beat) First, that the majority members of the Police Commission deserve the severest condemnation for their decision to whitewash the Collins case
erupts from the gallery at this
- Quietly   on Northcott, the Judge, Jury, others
Bailiff, will you bring me the verdict of the jury
The bailiff complies
The judge reads it, hands it back to the Bailiff, who brings it back to the Foreman
- As before
Second, we recommend that the suspension of Captain Jones be made permanent
Even louder applause, some cheering
The pattern continues through the balance of the statement
- Favoring Northcott
Will the defendant please rise
Northcott rises, still smiling, defiant
- As before
Third, that steps be taken to investigate a change in the prevailing laws and procedures by (more) True Story                                 120
(Cont'd) which a citizen of this city can be subjected to incarceration in the county's mental facilities
(beat) Finally, restoration of public confidence in the police department can only be achieved by the removal of its chief of police, and this committee so recommends
(beat) This hearing is concluded
The place explodes with cheers
- As the foreman stands again
You may read the verdict
We the jury find the defendant, Gordon Stewart Northcott
guilty on all counts of murder in the first degree
There are gasps and cries and tears
but Northcott is defiant
Does the defendant wish to make a statement before judgment is passed
Yeah,  want to make a statement
want to make it real clear that never once got a fair shake from you, your "honor," or this court
The only one of you here worth a goddamn is her -- (points to christine) -- 'cause she's the only one never badmouthed me to the press
She understands what it is when the police frame you for something you didn't do and throw you in the hole
Isn't that right
He looks to her
She doesn't flinch
want you to know, Mrs
Collins, never killed your boy
-- True Story                                     121
That's enough
Counsel, you will get control of your client or will have him bound and gagged
The defense attorney yanks Gordon around to face the judge
Gordon Stewart Northcott, it is the judgment of this court that you will be conveyed to San Quentin Prison, where you will be held in solitary confinement for a period of two years, until October 2nd, 1930
On that date, you are to be hanged by the neck until dead
May god have mercy on your soul
And he brings down the gavel
- Christine is standing outside, putting the horrors of the day out of her thoughts, as a door opens and Chief Davis comes out, followed by several reporters
-- no, as  said after the hearing, have every intention of finishing my term as Chief of the Los Angeles Police Department
will not resign
will fight to the finish
The Collins case was merely an excuse for certain politicians who have been trying to have me removed for some time, and  -- He pauses as he sees Christine
Looks away and continues in a lowered voice
-- anyway,  remain confident that the Mayor's office will stand firmly behind me
That's all
The press continue after him, not really noticing Christine, who takes one last look around at it all
and walks slowly away
Alone

,  30, 1930 True Story                                     122
- Christine, alone, rides the street car to work
The car stops in front of a school
Walter's school
She looks out the window, to where children are playing
Then looks away again as the street-car starts moving again
-   - Christine is back at work again, as she had been, though some of the light has gone out of her eyes
She moves from station to station, nodding her approval or checking off forms
She glances to the clock, it's a little after two, then goes to Mr
Harris, who has just come out onto the floor
Ten minute break
Of course
She starts away, turning at: You know
one of these days you might consider actually taking one of these ten minute breaks
Might be good for you
We'll see
Thanks, Ben
She heads off toward a back room
He watches her go with a combination of awe, respect and deep sadness
-   - Christine is on the telephone, crossing off contact numbers on a pad of paper
Yes, hello, this is Christine Collins, we spoke yesterday about my son
fine, thank you
was wondering if you'd had a chance to go through the file on runaways in your area in case anyone resembling Walter had -- (beat) see
No, thank you,  appreciate the information
Would it be all right if  called you again, in a month or so
Thank you
Goodbye
She checks his number off her list as Hahn appears in the partially open door behind her
True Story                                        123
He's heard part of the conversation, and there's a sadness in his eyes
She starts to dial again when he knocks on the door
She turns to see him, mid-dial
Mrs
Collins
Oh, hello,  was just -- know
That's
why  wanted to see you
His tone is grave, and she knows that something's happened
She hangs up the phone, missing the cradle the first time
It's about Walter
We had
well, we received a very strange telegram
From who
Gordon Northcott
He's
he's asked to see you
Why
He said he knows you're still looking for your son, and before he dies -- (beat) He says that he lied when he testified that he didn't kill Walter
He's willing to finally admit that he did it
He says that if you come up to see him, in person
he'll tell you the truth, to your face
so that you can get on with your life and have some peace
: - Christine is on the train headed north
The telegram is in her hand
True Story                                    124
(
) As you know, he's set to be executed the day after tomorrow at San Quentin, so
(beat) You don't have a lot of time
-    - She gets out of a taxi in front of the prison
It's a gray, grim sight, and moves toward it
(
) Took me most of the morning to make all the arrangements
Turns out you're the first woman in thirty years the state has allowed to visit a serial killer on the night of his execution
-   - Four bare walls and a long table
Two chairs
One window, behind bars and chicken wire
Christine waits, alone
Then: we  footsteps approaching down the hall
moment later, a   escorts Northcott into the room
Northcott nods to Christine, then glances to the guard, who looks to Christine
can stay in the room if you want, ma'am
No, 'm
sure 'll be fine
All right
'll be right outside the door if you need anything
(to northcott) Twenty minutes
The guard exits, leaving the two alone
Don't suppose you've got a cigarette
No,  don't smoke
He nods, walks to the window to a nearby structure
That's where they do it, you know
That building right over there
True Story                                  125
That's where they do what
The hangings
Ten o'clock tonight, get to see what's inside
hear there's thirteen steps going up to the gallows
'cause thirteen is unlucky
Helps make sure you're gonna go to hell when you die
But got 'em beat
outsmarted 'em
He looks to Christine, smiles nervously, glances back out the window
They're gonna let me have whatever want for dinner
Got a steak coming, with spinach, mashed potatoes and green beans
always wondered why they did that whole last meal thing
One of the other guys on Death Row said when you take the drop, you foul yourself, and everything you ate
comes out the other end
So maybe that's why they make sure you got something in you when it happens
They like knowing you fouled yourself on the way to -- He stops himself
Turns from the window
Sure you don't got a cigarette
She shakes her head
He nods absently for a moment
The warden, Clinton Duffy, he's a good guy
He's writing a book about all the death sentences he's carried out in this place
Says it's called "Eighty-Eight Men and Two Women
" Beats my record all to hell
Mr
Northcott
you asked me to come to see you
You said if did, you would tell me the truth about my son
Well, 'm here
Yeah
yeah, you are
But see, the thing is,  didn't think you'd really come, and now -- True Story                                  126
He's pacing, growing more agitated and scared
Now what
didn't expect
(beat) don't want to see you
What
can't do this
can't talk to you
not today, not tonight, not with what they're going to do to me
It's one thing to send a telegram, that's easy, but right now, right here, in person,  -- (beat) can't tell you what you want to hear, Mrs
Collins
can't, can't -- Why not
Because  don't want to die with a lie on my lips
He turns from her, in anguish
but is he just playing her
did my penance,  asked God to forgive me for my sins
and 've been good, ever since
if  commit a sin now, if  lie now
'm out of time,  can't be forgiven again
don't want to go to hell -- She goes around to him, faces him
Mr
Northcott
look at me
(beat) Look at me
He turns almost against his will
meets her eyes
Did you
kill
my son
His eyes go wide and he  , stumbling back and away from her
True Story                                    127
Get away from me
don't know anything about it
Mr
Northcott -- 'm innocent
(pounds door) Guard
Guard
The guard enters, going to Northcott
No, wait, please -- It's okay, ma'am, they always get a little nuts the day of
She pushes past him to Northcott, grabs the front of his shirt
Did you kill him
Did you kill my son
He screams in anguish, and the guard hauls him out, closing the door after him
Christine tries to open the door, but it won't open
Mr
Northcott
Mr
Northcott
She slowly slides to the floor, crying as we  the of  clanking, and we
: - The door to the prison yard opens and closes as Northcott is led into the area with the scaffolding
The Warden is there, waiting at the foot of the gallows, along with a chaplain
Several other parents, including Mr
and Mrs
Clay, are in the witness gallery at the back, separated from the gallows area by a large plate glass window
Christine is among the parents
The Clays see her, and put a hand on her arm for strength
Christine nods, accepting it, and moves to one side
Northcott, legs and arms bound in chains, makes his way to the warden at the base of the gallows
clock reads 9:50
True Story                                  128
Gordon Stewart Northcott, you have been found guilty of murder, the penalty for which is death by hanging
There have been no stays or reprieves, therefore the execution will go forward as stipulated under the laws of the State of California
Do you have any last words
No
nothing
(to chaplain) kept clean after  confessed, reverend
just like  said  would
The chaplain nods silently as the warden looks to the guards, who begin to escort Northcott up the steps to the gallows
Will it
will it hurt
(no reply) Please
not so fast
don't make me walk so fast
They struggle with him now, pushing and carrying him up the last of the thirteen steps to the top
They tie his legs together, and cinch his arms tightly in place
Thirteen steps
thirteen steps
but  didn't touch all of 'em, you bastards
didn't touch all of 'em
They start to slip a black felt mask over his head and secure the rope
He looks desperately to the witnesses
prayer
Please, somebody, say a prayer for me
The mask goes on and is tightened into place
The executioner approaches the handle that will open the trap door
The warden looks to the clock
9:59
From beneath the hood we , in a terrified, shaking voice: Silent night
holy night
all is calm
all is bright
round yon virgin mother and child
holy infant so tender and mild -- Just then the warden nods to the executioner who pulls the lever and the trap door
True Story                                   129
Northcott  through the door six feet then there's a and the body bounces in   at the end of the rope
as we  the sound of his heart slowing
slowing
until it finally stops
Christine covers her eyes
There is no cheering in the witness room
Only the sound of weeping
- Slowly, the witnesses exit the prison
We find Christine among them
She nods good-night to some of them, including the Clays, then starts off on her own, heading into the night
: :
27, 1935 And: - Just to , then: - '  - The brass plate on the partially open door announces
,
She's filling out paperwork as there's a  and a group of other employees and operators appears in the doorway
Hey, Chris
we're having an Oscar party tonight at my apartment, you want to come
can't
've got a million forms to fill out -- 'mon, please, they can wait -- Sandy, you guys blew out the phone lines between here and Baltimore, someone has to clean up the mess, and that's me
Besides, 've got a radio right here,  can follow the whole thing
You're sure
True Story                                    130
Positive
Go on, have fun
They head off
Christine focuses on her work
There's another knock on the door
said  can't go -- Are you sure
She looks up to see Ben Harris in the doorway
He smiles
'm meeting some friends for dinner at Musso and Frank's on Hollywood
They're going to pipe the Oscar ceremony through to the restaurant
Should be quite a night
'd love it if you'd come
Ben, that's very sweet, and  wish could
but  really need to stay and finish this
He nods, taking the rejection well
Starts off when: Ben
put down two dollars on "It Happened One Night" for best picture
Seems 'm the only one here who thinks it has a chance against "Cleopatra
" If  win, how about we have dinner tomorrow night to celebrate
You've got a deal, Christine
Good night
'Night
How about  call you if you win
'll be here
And with a smile, he's gone
True Story                                     131
-   - The night shift operators are working, a smaller group but still busy
We  through them until we start to  the sound of radio-miked applause, then: (on radio) Thank you
And now, it gives me distinct honor to present the category of Best Picture for 1934
'  - Where Christine is still working as the Academy Awards of 1935 play themselves out on the radio
(on radio) The nominees are "The Gay Divorcee," "Here Comes the Navy," "The Barrets of Wimpole Street," "One Night of Love," "The Thin Man," "Cleopatra" -- Over-rated
(on radio) "Viva Villa," "The White Parade," and "It Happened One Night
" Clark Gable, Claudette Colbert rest my case
(on radio) And the Oscar for Best Picture goes to
(beat) "It Happened One Night
" comes through the radio
and Christine is as pleased as if she'd just won herself
(calling out door) knew it
knew it
told you so
She's just about to go back to her work when the phone rings
She picks it up, smiling
True Story                                  132
Ben, it looks like dinner is on me, -- She stops
It's not Ben on the phone
Yes, this is she
Mrs
Clay
No, of course  remember you, how are you
Is everything -- She freezes at something she hears
When
Where did they -- (beat) No, of course
'll be right there
She hangs up, grabs her coat, and races out the door
- Christine climbs out of a taxi and rushes into the station
-   - Christine is ushered into a room with a long two-way mirror that looks out into an interview room
Mr
and Mrs
Clay are already there
In the other room is Detective Ybarra, and a young boy, , age 13
Mrs
Clay sees her, and they embrace
wanted to go to him right off, but they said it was important to talk to him alone first
Are they sure it's -- They're sure, but more important, 'm sure
(beat) It's my boy, all right
it's David
He's alive, Christine
They found him up in Hysperia
But how -- Mr
Clay motions for them to shush
They turn their attention to the other room, where Ybarra looks up from making notes
True Story                                     133
All right, so after you got into the car, what happened next
They drove me around for a long time, then we ended up at this ranch -- -  - David is shoved into the chicken coop
Several other are already there, scared, crying
They lunge at the door, trying to get out, but it slams shut in their faces
They scream, trying to get out
Gordon  an arm against the door, scaring them
(grinning) 'll see you boys later
He laughs and moves off, Sanford accompanying him, looking very guilty
(
) Were there other boys present
(
) Yeah
six,  think
It was a long time ago
(
) Did you speak to them
Do you remember any of their names
- the boys huddled against one wall, scared
(
) Yeah
two of them were brothers, think their last name was Winslow, something like that
The oldest was Jeffrey,  think he was around eleven
(beat) and Walter
We   on the last kid
on Walter Collins, at last
- As Christine  to this, her hand flying to her mouth
Not daring to breathe
True Story                                    134
Walter
Yeah
Do you remember his last name
Collins
Christine covers her face
Can barely stand up
So if you only remember some of the names of the rest, how come you remember his full name
Because of what happened
- Two of the kids, Walter and Jeffrey, are sitting in a corner, talking quietly, urgently
(
) Walter and Jeffrey were talking when everybody else was screaming
They were scared, same as the rest of us, but they weren't scared stupid
They kept checking around until they found a part of the coop where the chicken wire was all messed up
They pull at the wiring
Part of the roof weakens and dust sifts down
(
) They figured we might be able to yank the chicken wire and bring down the corner, maybe make enough room to get out of there and run
but it would make an awful lot of noise and if it wasn't wide enough, we'd be stuck
It might even bring the whole place down
We gotta try it
No
What he hears -- True Story                                   135
We have to get out of here
'm afraid
And in an echo of what he told his mother the last time he saw her: 'm not
'm not afraid of anything
(beat) Don't you want to go home
Don't you want to see your mom again
The Winslow kids nod, and start crying
Jeffrey and Walter look to the rest
Anybody else
David holds up his hand
Okay
Anybody who doesn't want to come, get over at that end in case this comes down
The Winslow boys and two others scramble to the other end, too terrified to try and escape
Jeffrey, David and Walter go to the weakened corner of the coop
When we get out, we split up, go in different directions, they can't catch all of us
Ready
They nod, and get into position, each taking a part of the wire framework
Pull
They do so, pulling for all they're worth
struggling
the ceiling  above them, dirt falling all over the place
they pull harder, the wire cutting into fingers, but still pulling
then suddenly -- -- the corner  , part of the roof starting to come down with it
The  is substantial
Go
True Story                                    136
They race out the opening, Jeffrey first, then Walter, then David
but just as the first two get clear -- Help
Walter turns to see David stuck in the wiring
go on around the ranch
He hesitates
then  back to David, helps to untangle him
They  a  blast, and running their way
Hurry
Walter gets him untangled, and the two  away from the coop, running for all they're worth as a  hits first one, then the other
They  -- -- and David catches one last glimpse of Walter running, heading for the line of trees
(
) And that's the last you saw of him
-   - As the interview continues
David nods
That's the last  saw of any of 'em
So you don't know if either of the other two were captured
No
All  know is, if he hadn't come back for me
don't think ever would've gotten out of there
What happened after that
hid in the woods for two days, too scared to move, because  was sure they'd find me
finally started walking, but every time a car came up  was afraid it was them
So  kept off the main roads until  saw a train stopped at a crossing, and  jumped in
True Story                                  137
Why didn't you tell anyone what had happened
was afraid
thought they'd come after me, or my folks
so didn't tell anybody
was on my own until  got a free meal from this lady, Mrs
Lansing
told her  was an orphan, on my own
She said  could stay on, and did
(beat) Every night, 'd wake up, thinking they were right outside my window
Then  heard the police talking on the radio about what happened at the ranch, and  thought, for sure can't go back now
Why not
Since  didn't tell anybody what happened,  was afraid they'd blame me for those kids being dead
So just
stayed away
So what made you come forward now, after all this time
David looks away, his eyes tearing up
Finally: miss my mom
miss my dad just
just want to go home
And it's all Mrs
Clay can take
Sobbing, she runs out of the viewing room and into the interview room, where she goes to her son and embraces him, holds him, the two crying into one another's arms
- Christine and Ybarra watch as Mr
and Mrs
Clay lead their son into their car
As they drive off, Christine finally breaks the silence
Still can't believe it
Five years, case closed, everyone thinks he's dead
and there he is
(more) True Story                                  138
(Cont'd) And he wouldn't be, if it wasn't for Walter
(beat) Your son did a brave thing, Mrs
Collins
You should be very proud of him
am
You don't think he's still out there, do you
Why not
Three boys made a run for it that night, Detective
If one got out, maybe either or both of the others did too
Maybe Walter went through the same fears he did
Afraid to come home or identify himself, afraid he'd get into trouble, that people might think it was his fault
Either way, it gives me something  didn't have before tonight
What's that
She looks at him
and smiles
Hope
She turns and walks off into the night, as we : Gordon Stewart Northcott was hanged on October 2, 1935 In exchange for his cooperation and a guilty plea, Sanford Wesley Clark was sentenced to the Whittier State School for Boys for five years
Upon being released in 1934, he returned home to Canada, and was never heard from again
Upon returning to duty after his suspension, Captain
Jones was demoted to Lieutenant and subsequently sued by Christine Collins in civil court
He was found guilty and fined $10,800 (equal to $125,000 in 2006 dollars)
He never paid
One year after the City Council recommended the removal of the Los Angeles Chief of Police, James  Davis resigned from office and was replaced by Roy
Steckel
True Story                                  139
Davis reclaimed that office in 1933, where he created the Red Squad, notorious for attacking Communists and their offices, but was forced to resign a second time under a cloud of police corruption
In the aftermath of the City Council hearings, the criminal justice system in California was revised to prevent women from being incarcerated or institutionalized for the crime of disagreeing with a male police officer
Strict medical procedures were set in place to prevent future abuse
In November 1929, Los Angeles Mayor George
Cryer was voted out of office after three terms
He was later found to have been the front man for the Crawford Organized Crime Syndicate, which ran prostitution and gambling rackets throughout Southern California
For the rest of his life, Reverend Gustav
Briegleb used his radio show to expose police misconduct and political corruption
He also published "The Layman's Handbook of Daniel
" The California community of Wineville, near Riverside, became synonymous with the infamous Northcott Murder Ranch
In order to shake free of the scandal, the residents changed its name to Mira Loma
Christine Collins never stopped searching for her son
The fate of Walter Collins remains a mystery
If he was able to escape the Northcott Ranch, he would be 86 years old today
