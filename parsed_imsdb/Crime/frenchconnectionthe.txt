One of the slips of paper catches his eye as he is going through the ritual of the cigarette mooch, a slip bearing the name of a girl
His attention is really on the entrance of the Club and both his conversation and the cigarette business are detached and incidental to the art of waiting through the stakeout
He stuffs the cards back into his pocket

The arch is still the largest in the world
Who financed it
37
Two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from New England to the South
It was actually the first railroad through New York City
Why is it called Hellgate
The river at this point is the most dangerous on the East Coast
Years ago, hundreds of ships went down here
If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list
Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it
Look how gracefully they conceived that arch
Like a bowstring
It was built from both ends
With no support in the middle
Beautiful
