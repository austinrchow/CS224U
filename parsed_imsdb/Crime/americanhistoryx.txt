screenplay by David McKenna February 6, 1997 - young man's blue eyes slowly open
girl moans from the next room
- turns the corner and splashes through a puddle from an earlier rain
blares from inside
- They snap wide as the young woman in the next room even louder
- slight buzz emanates from the power lines and street lights above the humble  household
black rests in the driveway
- ' rapping builds
The window-tinted drive-by slowly heads down the residential street, cruises past the Bronco in the driveway, and slows to a stop
The music stops and    spring from the car
They move with purpose
The larger figure, crowbar in hand, moves to the truck
The  wielding passenger hurries to the front door and stands guard
Inside the car, another man methodically waits
-  ' The sex happening in the next room makes it difficult for Danny to sleep
Next to a digital clock that reads 3:07AM, the clean cut 14-year-old flips to his side
poster of Lee Ving of  onstage, taped to the wall
Pre-Calculus and Biology books on the floor
Cassettes scattered on his tiny desk
stereo in the corner
The off-screen sound of breaking glass grabs Danny's attention
He sits up and looks through the blinds
- Danny  a man reach through the broken window and unlock the door
He quickly
pans to the idling Trans Am
'  - His fearful expression says it all
Holy shit
Danny quickly bolts out of his room and into the adjacent bedroom down the hall
He barges through the door
'  - It hangs above a serious computer and next to a giant, tome-filled bookshelf
The moans, meanwhile, approach orgasm
The young man has a shaved head, a thick goatee, and a well-crafted  on his left tit
On top of Derek in the bed is his barely-of-age girlfriend,
The covers are completely off and a is tattooed across her right shoulder blade
Danny watches her fuck, only for a second
(softly) Der
Danny walks over and shakes him
Startled, Derek forcefully grabs his little brother's arm
(controlled) What
Stacey stops and looks over
Frustated, she rolls off Derek and onto her side
Fucking pervert, Dan
There's a black guy outside Der
breaking into your car
Derek, muscled and tattooed, jumps out of the bed and quickly puts on his skivvies
He reaches under his mattress, pulls out a
45 semi-automatic pistol, and shoves in a clip
How long has he been out there
Not long
Who
Nobody
Relax
Stacey sits up quickly from the bed as Derek pulls on his black combat boots
Who's out there, Derek
Not right now, honey
(to Danny) How many
One
think
Is he strapped
Hunh
Does he have a fucking gun, Dan
'm not sure
Is there a driver
Danny nods his head yes
Okay
Stay the luck here
Derek
Be careful
He looks at his girlfriend and walks off
- He walks down the hall
The intensity on his face is alarming
He stops at the front door and grabs the doorknob
Before he turns the knob, he peeks through the eye hole on the door
- ' carelessly turns toward the driveway to see what's taking his partner so long with the wires
- The guard has his back to him
Derek goes
- Derek throws open the door and the black man standing guard wheels and fires a shot into the front door
Derek buries two bullets in his chest
Fuck you
The force propels the man six feet backwards
/
- Stunned by the gunfire, he charges back to the getaway Tranny
Derek buries a bullet into his shoulder
The car splits and Derek fires a shot through the side window
He then walks towards the car and fires shot after shot at it until it disappears
- Davina and Doris Vinyard yell in the background like they were in Vietnam
They meet in the hallway, still not able to place the direction of the gunfire
,
They stay down on the carpet together
- ' From the rain-soaked window he watches Derek face his wounded prey - crawling on the ground
Sirens sound from a distance
(
) Get down, Danny
Jesus
His gaze is locked on his brother from his bedroom window
Derek cocks his piece, points it and walks toward the man

Eyes blistering

He approaches a

Captain Rasmussen
Briefing room
Down that hall
third door on the left
- Cops and detectives sit attentively and a few sip coffee
The clock on the wall above reads 7:38
Middle-aged with slicked-back hair,    finishes a thought
He spots Sweeney as he enters and aimlessly reaches for a file
All right
Moving on-- (acknowledging) Good Morning, Doctor
The group looks over and meets Sweeney's hard glare
Good morning
Gentlemen, this is Dr
Bob Sweeney
He's Principal over at Venice High and for some time now he's done a load of outreach work with gangs
in and out of the can
Sweeney nods as Rasmussen cough
He sips water and continues
Three years ago a local kid named Derek Vinyard gets sent up for murdering a couple of Crips who were trying to jack his car
Bob taught Vinyard back in high school and has followed the case closely
He was a skinhead, right
Derek was more like
the skinhead
He and Cameron Alexander
#2 Who
Rasmussen opens a  in front of him
There rests Derek's mug shot
He flips it over and reveals '
Front and side view
Cammeron Alexander is probably the biggest writer and distributor of white power literature in  County
He promotes white power bands, writes reviews, columns, all at the ripe age of forty
(smiling) He's forty
Jesus
Pretty clean record
runs everything out of his house down by the beach
There weren't any organized white gangs around Venice before those two hooked up
Very few, if any
It was mostly just black and Mexican
But it was tiny
They hit it off though
and Alexander hit the jackpot with Derek
Rasmussen reaches over and pushes play on a
We got some uncut footage here

-- Earlier this evening
County Firefighter Dennis Vinyard was shot and killed while putting out a fire in a suspected Compton drug den
(to the group) This being February of '90
-    - , short haired with no tattoos, stands next to the reporter
Derek wears a Venice High Basketball jersey drenched in sweat
Towel around neck, he thinks to himself as the man speaks into the camera
To my right  have Lieutenant Vinyard's oldest son Derek
(to Derek) How do you feel about all this, son
How do  feel
How do you think feel
It's typical
Typical how, Derek
Well
look at our country
It's a haven for criminals
Black
brown
yellow
whatever
So you're saying the murder of your father is "race" related
Every problem in this country is "race" related
Every problem, not just crime
These problems are rooted in the black community, the Hispanic community, the Asian
every non- Protestant group in our society
(then) Look at the shit
Immigration
welfare
they're all the problems of the non-white
Look at the statistics
Most of these issues you're referring to though son are related to-- (interrupting) No no no
Don't say poverty right now cause that's not it
They're not a product of our fucking environment either
Minorities don't give two shits about this country
They're here to exploit
not embrace
(
) (over reporter's question) When Alexander got his hands on this segment
he copied it, sent it out and it became the Gettysberg Address for hate groups across the country
Millions of white Europeans came to this country and flourished within a generation
generation
So what the fuck is wrong with these people
What does any of this have to do with your father
Because my father was doing his fucking job
Saving a nigger neighborhood he didn't give two shits about
And he got killed by some drug dealer who still collects a fucking welfare check
Derek looks at the man and walks over to , who smokes a cigarette
The camera follows him as he puts his arm around her and escorts her back inside their Venice Beach residence
The camera pans back to the reporter who just stands there, speechless
- Rasmussen ejects the tape, the screen turns to fuzz, and he turns it off
Vinyard was quietly released from Chino on Saturday after three and some odd years
And  think it's something we might want to keep an eye on for a few days
don't wanna be an alarmist
But payback is out there
know it is
And in this particular case
if Vinyard gets popped
more people will get popped
It's not exactly  policy but want 24-hour surveillance on Vinyard for a few days
#2 (smiling in disbelief) Twenty-four hour surveillance, sir
Just for a few days
He doesn't sound like Mr
Lovely here, Captain
You want us to bust him or protect him
Rasmussen offers Sweeney a look that it's his question
don't think Vinyard's gonna be the one to start anything
It's his following
Either way
let's keep it low
: - by  blasts from Danny's walkman headphones
The day is cloudy and overcast but that doesn't bother the local
twosome paddles north to get a better break on the next set
Danny watches as he skateboards down the strand
His appearance is changed, now resembling a younger, softer Derek
Head shaved to a quarter of an inch, he wears a with punk/white power bands scribbled all over it
Your standard Sex Pistols, , Germs,
, and Adolescents in black
Cro-Magnons and Skrewdriver off to the left
In red is the largest name,
: - Kids from all walks of life park their cars, lock their bikes and head off to class
- Danny throws his  in, slams the door, and turns to face , a pretty, redheaded freshman
Hi Danny
Hey Lizzy
The two smile at one another as the
: - Danny takes a piss
Outside, a voice pleads "It wasn't me
"  , pale and thin, is shoved into the bathroom and he trips into the sink
, a young black kid, enters with two of his buddies
Danny zips up and faces them
(to a terrified Daryl) Tellin' Baker 'm fuckin' cheatin'
've never cheated in my life
#1 Beat his ass, Henry
Why you trippin' on me
didn't say anything, Henry swear
#2 He's lying, man
was right there
Little Henry cracks Daryl in the face and practically knocks him down with one shot
bleeding Daryl struggles to his hands and knees behind Danny
Next time, man
Danny stares into Henry's eyes and the trio exits
Dannv helps Daryl back up to the sink
: - Kids have just settled into their seats
Danny walks in and tries to be discrete
Vinyard
An   writes an Algebra problem on the board for the students to solve
You're late
The man grabs a pink slip off his desk and hands it to Danny
But it looks like you got bigger problems
(reading the slip) Oh, man
Come on
Get a job
The teacher stares at him
: - He sits in a chair next to an office door marked
-
Danny glances at the secretary as she types and talks on the phone
He listens to the conversation through the the crack in the door as his eyes swell
(
) do not have a problem with him as an individual, alright
(
) Oh shit Murray sure you do
You hate this kid
- The bespectacled, short-haired  , 48, looks over and spots Danny listening outside
Murray walks over and shuts the door
He looks at
, who now has his jacket off
He points to a typewritten report on the desk and smiles in horror
It is titled  --
"Daniel Vinvard - American History" is in the upper left hand corner
This paper is a travesty, Bob
Arguing for Hitler as a civil rights hero
You've gotta draw a line
Murray
it says in your syllabus that they could do their report on any book related to the struggle for Civil Rights
Oh come on, Bob
Let me finish
He needs help
'm not disputing that
But  read it and 'm not going to throw him out
His brother probably put him up to it
can guarantee you his brother didn't have anything to do with it, Murray
Murray sighs and takes off his glasses
Don't let him walk scot-free here
For his sake
not mine
You might be all he has left
Sweeney stares at the younger teacher and nods
: - Murray walks out and turns back to Sweeney
Thanks, Bob
(
) Okay
Get in here, Dan
Danny and Murray make hostile eye contact
knew it was you
(
) Shut up and get your ass in here
- Before he even gets through the door he's chastised
What's it gonna be, Dan
What's what going to be
This petty shit you're pullin'
Well
don't know
You said it, all right
Sit down
Danny does what he's told
Sweeney stares at the teenager and leans back in his chair
Are you okay
Yeah
Any time you wanna talk, Dan-- Okay
How's Derek
Fine
Adjusting okay
Yeah
He was a student of mine
Honors English
He was a great student
like you
but he hung out with scumbags
Also like you
That's why he ended up in the pen, hunh
No answer
Sweeney holds up Danny's paper
Great writing
can't correct it though
It wreaks too much of shit
Come on, man
followed directions and wrote an "" paper
It's got nothing to do with Derek
Everything you do now has something to do with Derek
Who told you to do this
Let us get on with our lives, man
Hey, 'm not worried about Derek--he can take care of himself
'm worried about his little brother
(softly) Mein Kampf, Dan
should expel you
Do it
What
You don't think  could handle it
(smiling in disbelief) The street would kill you, Danny
You're not tough
The second a brother pulls a gun on your ass you'll be holierin' for Doris
(pondering to himself) So here's the drill
Take it or leave it cause 'm sick of babysitting
'm your history teacher from here on out
We're gonna deal with shit happening right now
Call it American History
see your ass once a day
Any more, any less, and you're a memory at Venice High
Clear
It took me a week to read Mein Kampf
Come on, Sweeney
My name is Dr
Sweeney
And  want a another paper on my desk tomorrow
What am  doing it on then
It' not a "what", it's a "who
" (after a beat) Derek
: - series of intercuts shows activity in and around the pier
searches a trash dumpster
sell tie-dye and water bong paraphernalia
walks past eating a hot dog play basketball in their low-rider shorts and boxers
He skateboards down the boardwalk, performing tricks and spinning the board
He eats shit, recovers, and looks off into the distance
(/) People look at me
and they see my brother
That's how things have gone since the murder of our father
- From afar, he spots a group of black gang members shoot hoops
He and Little Henry from earlier exchange a cold glance
(/) Little Henry Hastings and his older brother Jerome
Jerome's a Shoreline Crip
Henry's on his way
Little Henry and older brother  catch their breath and stare down Dan
Danny doesn't flinch
Jerome sips from a 40 oz
beer and resumes playing
(/) Venice Beach, man
It didn't always look like this
mean
our Dad used to take us down here to run
and it was cool
Derek fucking owned this place
Since then though
the gangs, man-- DANNy
He watches the basketball action as he takes a drag off his Marlboro Red
(/) --they've moved west from Inglewood and South Central and have really just
taken over
Especially at my high school
The Venice Locos are big too but they hang out in bumluck Mar Vista
It's scary

The teams are a mixed assemblage of 3 blacks and 2 Latinos and 3 whites and 1 black and 1 Latino

One of the skins, , has a shaved head, a light beard and an -16  tattooed on his head
and   sit together to the right of the court and monitor closely
Danny looks over his left shoulder and sees Derek and Stacey sit with
Cowboy hat and  , they sit and converse on the bleachers
Seven-six
Let's go
Set some picks
Bring it on, boy
Derek quickly moves his eyes to the court
Boy
Lawrence quickly pivots past Seth, dunks it, and yells as he hangs on the rim
The crowd cheers
Lucky piece of shit
'm through "monkeying" around with your ass
Lawrence spins around and challenges Seth
Fat, pasty, pale, pastrami eating, cracker, motherfucker
hundred bucks says  make you my bitch
(to the crowd) Here we go
Trying to make ends meet for that cut in welfare
He makes a scene and passes Danny on the sideline
Lawrence waits for Seth to take it further
Danny looks at him, concerned
It's eight-six, Seth
When  want your fucking opinion 'll ask for it, fuckhead
(to Derek and Cam) Help me cover here, guys
Derek and Cameron stare at Seth, knowing Seth will lose and embarrass them
You got a big fucking mouth, fat kid
'll take this negro down
You can't take a shit, Seth
Shut up
Derek shoots a look to Cameron, comes to a decision, and stands
He shouts for all to hear
got a bet
Lawrence stares at him, sensing something harder
come in, same score now, first one to eleven
Black boys against the white boys
Lawrence looks back to his boys in disbelief
Name your price, Cracker
No money
for the court
We win, you grab your shit and find a different place to run
Not just today
forever
You win, and we don't come back
No hitching, no fighting, here in front of everyone
Six-eight, our ball
The action around the court gets very still
Finally, Lawrence nods
You got a lot of fucking balls, man
Bring it
Right now
Derek pulls off his sweatshirt and gives it to Stacey
Lawrence gets his team together
: - No more mixed assemblage of players
One team is white, one team is black
Derek blows by Lawrence for a left handed layup
Derek hits a thirty looter
Curtis grabs a rebound and uses his elbows to get defenders off him
Big Lawrence fouls Derek hard and Derek stares at him
Big Lawrence makes a twenty foot turnaround
Lawrence advances on a three on two and dunks it
Derek pump fakes three times and uses the glass for a deuce
Finally, Derek drives the lane and dishes to Seth at the last minute for a bucket
Yes
Ten a piece
Nice fucking dish
and  slap Derek's hand as they get back on transition
Derek stares at Lawrence
watches intently
It's all you, Der
Fuckin' , man
All right
All we need is one now
Lawrence and Derek lock eyes, a look exceeding competitive boundary
look filled with rage
Use that fat ass and keep him out, Seth
Seth and the opposing player bang to get position underneath
ain't losin' in my house
Clear it out
The   dribbles beautifully up the court -- his teammates clearing out the key
Defensively, Derek is solid
He tries to pass Derek but Derek's defense is stifling
Again
With another tricky move, Lawrence inadvertently puts his   into Derek's face, sending him quickly to the pavement
That's fuckin' offense
Get the fuck outta here
He was movin' his feet
Derek, teeth bloodied, rises
The two have a stare down
(threateningly) 'll go if you want to
You wanna piece
Bring it
Players quickly rush to restrain the two even though the teams hate each other
If you wanna go
'm ready
Don't be throwin' fuckin' elbows
Fuck you
Derek walks over to Cammeron, Danny and Stacey standing courtside
She has a water bottle and a towel waiting for him
He wipes his   and takes a sip
Cameron stares at Derek
Hey
Are you copacetic
Derek nods and looks at Danny and Stacey
He's gonna do that 180 spin move
know what he's gonna do
You gotta call offense on that shit
Not on point game you don't
Fuck that,
That chucker can't pull that shit
It's fucking- Not on point, honey
He turns back to the court and walks over to Lawrence
He stands in front of him and checks the ball in
Tens
Lawrence takes the ball, passes it to the wing, and quickly gets it back
Lawrence dribbles up top, makes a marvelous 180 spin with the ball, and pulls up for a ten foot jumper
Derek reads it perfectly and
Lawrence trips to the ground, Derek grabs the ball off the fast break and
(amazed by the dunk) Holy shit
Everybody courtside goes nuts
Derek walks to the sideline, ignoring all the hand slaps being offered
Everyone is riveted on Derek
(to the other team) Get off my  fucking court
This is my house
Yeah
Fuck
yeah
sweaty Derek pulls his little brother close
He takes a drink of water, spits out more blood, looks at his bitter opponent, and says nothing

Derek meets their gaze

He stands there, wishing the day would just end
Oh man--
Come on
What are you crying about now

Danny looks to his mother
Are you feeling better at all

Danny wipes away her tears, kisses her, and moves away quickly so he won't get sick

She opens the door and tries to shut it immediately

Back in his bedroom
Seth pushes Danny to the side, passes Doris and yells
(smiling) Where are you, you free motherfucker
Seth moves down the hall and bangs on Derek's door
Vinyard
He's on the phone, asshole
Fuck off

) 'll be out in a minute
Without pushing it, Seth undoes his pants and moves into the bathroom
Danny walks down the hall
- Seth sits on the toilet
Danny pushes the door slightly and stares at Seth's  on the bathroom counter
Danny looks at him
After a few seconds-- What are you lookin' at
'm still trying to figure it out
Come in here and 'll show you, maggot

He opens the door and sees Derek on the phone with his back to him
Above Derek is Danny's surfboard, hanging on ropes hooked to the ceiling
Blue jeans, black boots and slicked back hair, Derek holds his hand up and motions for Dan to be quiet
The sleeves of tats covering his arms, shoulders and back (
) define the hatred that has engulfed his past

Okay

Seth smiles at the youth and speaks intimately
What do you hate, Danny
hate everyone that isn't white Protestant
Why
And say it with some fucking conviction
Because they're a burden to the advancement of the white race
Some of them are all right-- None of them are all right, Danny
They're all a bunch of fucking freeloaders

That's the best shit 've ever heard come out of that mouth
She stares at the two hate mongers
feel
sorry for you, Danny
Shut up, Davina
You shut up, you poison to fuckin' society
Get out of our house
(laughing) Is this any way to treat a guest
Derek hates you, Seth
(
) How do you know who  hate, Davina
-
He's a striking presence with his scruff, tight t-shirt and tats hanging down his arm
black jacket wraps around his waist
(
) What do you mean
Seth stands and smiles
Hey
How are you, man
Fuckin'
Long time no see
Look at that hair
Seth moves to hug his old friend but Derek offers a reluctant hand instead
Gimme just one second, okay
Seth nods as Derek stares at Danny
Did you do a book report on Mein Kampf
What's it to you
(ready to kill) What's it to me
(seeing this) mean
how'd you find out
None of your fucking business how found out
thought it was a great idea
That figures
You're more stupid than he is
It's nice to see you too, man
Why'd you do it, Dan
Because of Seth
No
Cammeron
did it cause  felt like it
Oh, you do everything you feel like
feel like smacking you in the fucking head
Would you mind if  did a report on that
Uhhh
yeah
Get a clue, you dumbshit
Hey
Look at me
Don't be a dickhead
Sweeney cares about you
(smiling) Sweeney does
Since when
Was that him on the phone
Yep
So wise up
You hear me
Sweeney's a fuckin' nigger on a power trip, Vinyard
That's what he was like when we were there and that's how he is now
It'll never change either
nigger is a nigger
Derek stares at Seth, ready to beat the fuck out of him
Suddenly, Doris starts in with a
Derek quickly fills a glass of water and goes in there
- She coughs incessantly
Derek sits down beside her, hands her the water, and caresses her head
The others stare at her in the background
Just put me out of my mercy
You'll be okay
You want me to pick you up any more medicine
Together they look at all the bottles and laugh
Derek checks out the couch
Jesus
can't believe  ever let it get this bad
It's not that uncomfortable
Are you gonna to live or what, Mom
need a cigarette
My ass
You smoke two packs a day
That's why you're spittin' phlegm
Doris coughs once again and spits green into her napkin
(astonished) Jesus, Mrs
Vinyard
think a lung just came up
Everybody laughs -- including Doris
Derek tenderly puts his hand on his mother's cheek
'm high as a kite
You got any more
Daniel
know you got homework
'm goin' in a second
Relax
(interjecting to Derek) Hey
'm gonna re-wipe and we're out of here
Seth laughs as he walks down the hall
You're a pig
don't like him in this house
knew
He ' s a fuckin ' loser, Nazi scumbag
No he's not
Yes he is
Open your eyes
Danny looks at Derek and smiles
Whatever, dude
'm gonna go power that shit and 'll see you later
He pats his brother on the shoulder and walks off
Not at Cammeron's you won't see me
(turning back) Come on, Der
It's gonna be fuckin'-- Forget it, Danny
It ain't gonna happen for you tonight
Danny walks off, frustrated
He crosses Seth's path, gets shoved into the wall, and reacts like it's an everyday occurrence
Seth moves out the side window and climbs out
Hurry up
'm starving
What else is new
Derek nods, looks at his mother and kisses her on the forehead
'll see ya
Okay
Be careful
will
Derek follows Seth out the   and goes down the alley
- She thinks to herself and closes her eyes
- ' Derek looks at the oblivious cops and drops into the passenger's seat
Seth starts the engine and drives away
As the truck disappears, we pick up on a turning the corner
Tinted windows, it cruises past the apartment complex
'  - : Danny's attention is everywhere except on his homework
This sucks
He walks back out of his bedroom
/  - ' He watches Davina complete her homework on the couch
Doris, on the sofa opposite, tries to sleep
Hey
Hey what
Come here
What
Come here for a second
The scholar sets her homework aside and impatiently follows him down the hall
- She sits on the edge of ' bed
Danny hands her his assignment instructions
got shit to do, Dan
Just read it
She sighs and begins to read it out loud
"American History
Take home paper as assigned by Principal Robert Sweeney
" (to Danny) Why is he giving you homework
What happened to Murray
Asshole turned me in
Why
Just read
"Describe in detail your opinion of -the historical event that took place in the early morning of October 4th, 1993
" What's that
The night Derek wasted those guys
Davina takes a moment
Sweeney gave you this
Yep
(continuing her reading) "Before and after
how has this event helped or hurt your present perspective concerning life in contemporary America
Use the standard five paragraph format, blab blab blah--this'll be good for you
Nooo
it'll be good for you
She stares at him for a good three seconds
Eat me, Dan
Come on
Dick Nixon's playin' at Cammeron's tonight
You owe me
'm not doing your homework for you
gotta spreadsheet due
Goddammit
Davina walks to the door and looks back to her brother
What's the matter with you
You wanna be a fuckin' loser your whole life
Not receiving a response, she walks out the door
Asshole Sweeney
He slowly begins to strike the computer keys
The screen reads "People look at me and they see my brother
That's the way things have gone since the murder of our father," The frustated kid sits and thinks to himself
himself
: -  - ,
In the distant corner we see a few parked cars and a group of skins gathering
(/) It was lunacy after he left us
All the time
Derek believed in Cammeron
he was angry
that combination gave them bodies
White punks
sick of gettin' their asses kicked by black and mexican gangs at school
Seven skins, including Seth and Curtis, smoke and wait
'
Danny looks to his left and sees Derek with Cammeron, who sits in the driver's seat of the
Stacey leans in from the backseat
hope you kill that fucker
Derek looks back at her and straight to Cameron
He might have a gun
Are you going in or not
You know  got the cops on me
If come up on one of those cameras 'm a dead man
Derek stares at the older man, who appears nervous
Somebody needs to drive, Derek
(referring to his mouth) All right
You can turn it off now
(back to Stacey) You're right on his tail, right
(nodding) hate that fucking Korean
hope you smash his face in
Just be ready, okay
She nods and Derek gets out
The group is silent
Come on
Let's pull it together
Hey
We're not playing fuckin' games here
Let's go
The group snaps to attention behind him as Seth toys with the camera
from earlier takes a hit off a joint and makes Derek wait for him
Derek walks over to the crazy man, takes the joint, and throws it onto the ground
What the fuck, Curtis
You a fuckin' nigger now
Want some crack
No
(grabbing his neck) Pull your fucking stupid head out of your ass then
Okay
Jesus
(to the group) We're here tonight cause we got immigration problems spiralling out of control
We got Asians up the ass
taking over our land with their fucking Yen
Mexicans
flocking into this place like some giant fucking Pinata was shattered
The group busts up
Cammeron watches Derek and smiles
Don't laugh
It's tragic
On the Statue of Liberty it says "Give me your tired, your hungry, your poor, your huddled masses
yearning to be free
" It does not say give me your shiftless, your greedy, your indolent, your criminals, looking for a free ticket
The group agrees
We're here tonight to show the government how we feel about minorities taking over our country
The treat us like criminals while they reward them with jobs and fucking welfare checks
And it's only getting worse
(nodding) Fuck yeah it is
Are you ready to do something about it
Yeah
Okay then
'
In formation
Fast
Directly at us
Angry
As the camera swings into line,   , Derek reaches into his back pocket and pulls out a He pulls it down over his face
The foot soldiers follow him in unison
(back to his troops) Remember
No names
Danny
Stay right on my fucking ass, man
And now they're getting ahead of us
As the behind them, we see their destination
- They storm the front entrance
The few people who are in there scream and scramble for cover
Derek grabs a Mexican boxboy and throws him to the ground
Seth catches up to another and gets him on the ground
Wheto's your fucking green card, asshole
Seth kicks the young man in the face with a blatant shot and continues
leaves a terrified white woman alone like she's not even there and pushes over an adjacent shelf, knocking over another worker with (referring to the border) Can't hide from me, motherfucker
He kicks the man and looks around the market for more
Danny watches in awe
Curtis breaks a giant jelly jar over a head
Another skin throws a   into a shelf of
'
He looks up at one of the aisle mirrors
-  55-- He rushes out with a pistol
He takes aim on Curtis and-- ,       ' Danny looks at Derek like he's Superman
Derek looks to his watch and straightens up
Let's go
We're outta here
Move
From just inside the door we see skins get in their last blows and pour out the aisles and pass us through the doors ; - He takes off his stocking mask and stares at his stone- faced brother
(/) And before Derek could even blink
he had a crazed army behind him
: -  - Danny sparks up a cigarette and types on the screen
(/) Willing to follow his word like it was the word of God
: -    - As the rain falls, we see the Vinyards sitting at the table
Stacey and Murray Rosenberg, Doris' then boyfriend who we met earlier, round out the clan
Stacey sits close to Derek
(/) And then came October 4th, 1993
- Doris looks wonderful while Murray, mustache and beard, shakes his head at Derek as he chatters away
(/) Things were fine on the homefront
My Mom had a good job but a below average boyfriend
We had a four-bedroom house that Dad left us with
Everyone was happy
Shaved head, rolled-up sleeves, tattoos, loosened tie,    name tag from earlier
His charisma draws their attention as he rambles over the crackling rainfall
(/) Everyone but Derek
Fuck you, Murray
White men don't cruise the streets of  killing each other
No
You guys make bombs
Derek stares at the man, eyes filled with homicide
You're so fucking lame
couple of cranks in cabins in Montana is not statistically significant
(then) White Americans don't take  and drink and drive a hundred and twenty fuckin' miles an hour
We pull over and trust the law
You're kidding, right
(sarcastically) Don't you know, Murray
White people never break the law
We're perfect little angels
That's not what  said, Davina
(to the group) Three different times Rodney King comes at those officers with the intent to hurt them
To hurt them
Three times
But since we see it on some fucking tampered videotape
the bleeding heart media makes you believe that he only comes at them once
All we see is Powell, Koon and Wind hittin' him and-- (busting up laughing) Briseno kickin' him in the back of the fuckin' skull with his boot
Still, the dumbfuck's tryin' to get up and kick their asses
That's how stupid that motherfucker is
Those cops used textbook-solid tactics and if Dad were still here he'd say the same damn thing
That doesn't make it right
Yes it does
Yes it does
They're cops
They are taught to use that stick and they did
Excessively
No
Appropriately
Appropriately
Cops have been granted a certain amount of authority by society and white people, unfortunately, are the only ones who acknowledge it acknowledge a cop's authority
Davina starts to laugh
Look who's talking about respecting the law
Mr
here
That's two errors in one sentence, Davina, so take a fucking course in semantics
First error-- didn't say respect the law
said  respect a cop's authority
Second error
'm not a member of the fuckin' low rent, disorganized, redneck Ku Klux Klan
Pull your head outta your ass and look at who you're dealing with
Don't speak to her that way, Derek
Murray, stay out of it
You're not a member of this family and you never will be
What the hell does that have to do with anything
(to Derek) You know
sometimes it's hard to believe  gave birth to you
Give thanks to the food on the table and then believe it, Doris
We both put food on this table, fella
True enough
The point is
if Dan was walking across the street that night and Rodney King plowed into him-- Can we forget about Rodney King for chrissake
(fiercely continuing) --while hopped up on Chivas and you'd consider the force those cops used to be justified
He didn't hit anybody
If he did though
If that shithead killed Dan
you would have believed the beating to be justified and so would everybody else
But since he didn't hit anyone
it's "Hands Across America" for the son of a bitch
Derek takes a bite of food
We are still so hung up in this notion that we have an obligation to help the struggling black man and all you contribute to it
Lincoln freed the slaves a hundred and thirty years ago
Get off your fucking asses
'm with you, honey
All the way
It's one
giant
ploy
Here we go
mean
nobody likes Chief whatever his name is, right
Gates
Yeah
So here comes this filthy piece of garbage in his Hyundai
He pulls over in front of a perfectly lighted area where a video camera is sitting there
fucking waiting for him, man
What happens next
Chief Gates is dust
It's total-- Davina drops her silverware on the plate with a clatter and looks at her mother
Everyone stares at Davina
(to Doris) May  be excused please
Don't interrupt, Davina
didn't interrupt shit
The hell you didn't
was listening to Stacey and then  heard you
That's called interrupting
Wait 'til she's finished and you can be excused
Who the hell do you think you are
Derek jumps up from the table and grabs her by the back of the hair
The table  and plates tumble to zhe floor
You don't know when to shut up
Dammit Derek
What are you trying to prove, man
Derek turns and laughs at Murray
'm trying to teach my sister some respect, Murray
Let go of my fucking hair
(to Murray) See
See the way she speaks
Tell me you're gonna shut up and 'll let go
Derek
Let go of her hair and sit down
will when  hear an answer, Doris
Are you going to shut up, Davina
He gets up quickly and tries to pull Derek off
Derek turns and cracks Danny in the face with a , dropping him back into a cabinet
crystal vase with flowers crashes to the floor, just missing Danny's head
Jesus
(to Danny) What are  you thinkin'
Danny
Are you okay
Danny nods his head as everyone looks at Derek
It's a real easy question, Davina simple yes or no will suffice
Tell me what  want to hear and 'll let go
Fuck
you
Derek takes a piece of roast beef off her plate and shoves it in her mouth
Me holds the whole piece inside so she can't spit it out
Davina cries as she chokes on the meat
She can't breathe, Derek
Stay back, both of you
It's her bed, she's gotta lie in it
(grabbing harder) You can cry all you want, Davina
'm not gonna let go until you tell me what  wanna hear
Are you going to shut that fat fucking mouth of your's and let my girlfriend tell her opinion
Are you
grabs him from behind and he aggressively turns on her
Derek curls his tongue behind his teeth and raises his arm like he's actually going to smack his mother
She grabs his arm though, forcefully
Let go of her hair and get out
Derek releases his grip on his sister and she spits the roast beef onto the floor
She runs into the back bedroom crying, choking and coughing
(
) hate you, you fucking asshole
The door slams shut in the background
Doris, Murray, Danny, and Stacey all stare at Derek
Derek calmly faces his brother
You okay
Danny nods
(softly) Psycho
--Time  as Derek slowly turns his head back to Murray
we hear a few keys being typed and then silence
cigarette sizzles
: -   - He takes a long drag off his cigarette and exhales
He slowly runs his hands over his stubbly head, marveling at the past
: -    -
Derek smiles at Murray in wonder and disbelief
Would you care to repeat that, Murray
'm not sure  got all of it
(smiling) He called you a "psycho", honey
(smiling back) Was that it
Thanks Murray
See
Here we go again with this, Derek
Making me out to be the bad guy again
You callin' me a liar, RosenKike
(to Stacey) Hey goddammit
You talk to me with respect or--
Or what, Murray
What're you gonna do
Give her fucking detention
Both of you get out right now
Murray stares at Derek with pity
Doris becomes emotional
(to Derek) Do you think you're the only one who's affected around here
Derek focuses on his mother for a moment
captivated Danny watches and waits as Derek turns to Murray
Out of respect for my mother
'm gonna let that comment go, Murray won't bash your face in
But let me tell you somethin'
man to fuckin' mouse here
Normally in a situation like this 'd take my steel-tips to your fucking Jewish temple
That goes for anyone making comments about me, my family, Stacey, whomever
You know and  know that  could crush that puny fuckin' skull of yours in a second
So it's beyond me why you would say something like that without being able to back it up
What's worse, you sack of shit, is you calling the woman  love a liar
never said she was a liar
Weasel like that again Murray
you fuckin' ponytail, pussy, bagel eating, teacher, faggot
and 'll cut your shylock nose off
Make no mistake
Murray silently walks out of the house
Derek claps and sings the Jewish celebration song "Hava Naghila
" Stacey joins in and the two laugh
Doris goes after Murray
Murray Rosenberg
International Jew
- Murray goes to his car and Doris follows
Danny watches from the door
He's a stupid kid, Murray
'm sorry
He's not a kid, Doris
We were kids
We didn't call people kikes
It's just gonna take some time with him
What can  do
You don't know your children, Doris
You have no clue about the world they live in
Your son is a terrorist
He's not a terrorist, Murray
Jesus
He's a member of the Disciples of Christ
You remember that grocery store incident
Murray
My sister and her two kids got evacuated from her Temple in Woodland Hills
Murray
Please
Derek would never have anything to do with bombs, okay
You don't know him like  do
And  wouldn't want to
Goodbye
Murray gets inside and goes down the street
- '  -- He watches Doris stand alone, her face in her hands, crying
Dan a humiliated Davina storms towards Derek, now wielding a
Davina
Derek hears Dan and looks out of the corner of his eye
He spots her at the last moment
Take this, you fucking dick
Derek pops up quickly, disarms her, and pulls her close
Davina
It's okay
Calm down
Please
Fuck you
Let go
(whispering in her ear) 'm sorry, Davina
Come on
Let go of me
Come on, Davina
'm sorry
lost control
Please
screwed up
Derek holds tight until the crying girl settles down
He's gripped as desperately by remorse as he was moments before by rage
He kisses and repeats his apology over and over
Finally, she succumbs and puts her arms around him
Derek looks to Danny
(hugging Davina) You guys are my life and 'd do anything for you
You do know that
(wiping her tears) don't believe you anymore
swear to God  would, Davina
Please
believe you, Der
Derek smiles at his little brother, lovingly
Davina
Please forgive me
Please
'm sorry
(nodding, after a beat) That fuckin' sucked, Derek
know it did
And 'm sorry
just really hate that guy
You couldn't tell
walks through the front door
Find an apartment because  want you out of here
Morn, 'm sorry but that guy's-- don't wanna hear it anymore
want you out
He can move in with me
When
Tomorrow
Good
She walks past Derek and into the back bedroom
: -   '  - He rises from the computer and  out the blinds
The two cops supposedly watching Derek are now eating in the car
One of them looks up
Danny flips the blinds down
From the other room, he hears Doris break into another coughing fit
- He sits beside her and hands her a glass of water
Here
Thank you, honey
She coughs, recovers, and sips
Danny walks away
Hey
Come here
Sit with me
've got this thing to do
You can sit down for two seconds
He looks at her and sits beside her
Don't breathe on me
won't
They share a smile
It's cold in here, no wonder your sick
She stares and smiles at him for a few moments
What
What
'm not allowed to look at you anymore
He smothers her face with his hand, jokingly
No
You're not
(laughing) Daniel Patrick
Stop it
Are you ever gonna let that beautiful hair grow back
Nope
Never
bet you will
He smiles and locks eyes with his mother for several moments
He finally rises and walks back to his room
Get some sleep
If you need me to proof anything for you  will
'll be all right
Wake up early if you get tired
Doris watches him disappear down the hall, distant thoughts creeping back slowly
- He grabs a flannel and throws it on
He sees a cigar box that rests on the right shelf
He grabs it and looks inside
The rolled-up   clipping reads "Prominent Skinhead Charged with Murder
" The accompanying picture of Derek is near evil
Danny stares at the clipping --
: -   - He watches Derek fire his gun at the   as it blazes down the street
He walks over to the wounded man on the lawn and points his weapon
(
) Get on the floor, Danny
Jesus
Danny looks down at her and hurries out of his room
- He hovers over big Lawrence
Gun pointed steadily, he kicks him in the stomach over and over -- tongue pressed against teeth
Hot air flows from Derek's breath and into the cold
You fucked with the wrong bull
Goddamn, man
Danny watches his brother from the front porch
Let the cops handle it, Der
Fuck that
The cops will let him walk
Derek grabs Lawrence and drags him to the
Ever shoot at firemen, you fuck
(then) Open your mouth and put it on the corner of the curb
'm gonna teach you a little lesson
Derek
Get in the fucking house, Dan
Danny doesn't move
Come on, man
Call an ambulance
My dad gave me that truck, motherfucker
Couldn't leave well enough alone
Put your mouth on the corner of the fucking curb
Derek cocks his piece and Lawrence complies--his teeth now scraping concrete
sound from afar
Danny walks out into the middle of the street to check it out
The cops are comin' Der' Lawrence mumbles something unintelligible from his outstretched mouth
What the fuck did you say
You just threaten me
Hunh
Hunh
Hunh
(anticipating) No
Derek  his foot on the back of ' head - completely tearing his jaw in half on the curb's corner
(crying) Holy fucking shit
Derek
What the hell was that for
Jesus
The two lock eyes
Derek does not flinch
Helicopter lights shine on the house
'
Two cops take cover behind their door, draw their guns, and shout instructions
Derek puts the gun down, puts his arms behind his head, and drops to his knees
His eyes are remorseless
(/) Joseph Conrad once wrote that "murder is always with us
It's almost an institution
" That couldn't rang more true than with me
: -    - , a  ,  , and a throng of terrified  strangle the front of the house
Clothed and handcuffed, Derek is escorted from the house by two uniformed cops and
(/) Bobby Lawrence died of massive head trauma early that morning
Derek marches past the bodies -- which are being tended to thoroughly
(/) Six months after that
Derek was convicted and sentenced to seven years for voluntary manslaughter
to be served at the California State Penitentiary in Chino
Rasmussen forces Derek's head down and he gets in the car
He stares at his brother and sister as police lights flash on him
Then to Stacey
Finally, to a lifeless Doris
They lock eyes as the patrol car takes off down the street
(/) Prosecutors wanted murder one for my brother's torture method
but there wasn't enough "premeditated" evidence
: - ' They clearly focus on the computer
is the sentence "There might have been if  testified
" Only when he hits the   does it disappear
He continues typing

My mother

stood by Derek
Danny's interrupted by a   on the front door
- ' He looks through the  and sees it's He sighs in relief and opens the door
We're here, dude
Drop your dick and grab your stick
told you  can't tonight
(
) (from the couch) Danny
It's okay, Mom
The two punks laugh as Danny pushes them and their boards back to his bedroom
He shuts his bedroom door
- Danny looks at the two
If  don't finish this thing 'm dead
Just tell 'em you'll do it tomorrow
You can't miss the party
Fire pie Lizzy called and told us to grab your ass
She did
(nodding) You gotta hit that shit
It's the only fun thing that's legal anymore
The   and Danny grabs it
Hello
- The only illumination shines through the window from the street
Holding his briefcase, he stands over his desk phone, all packed up and almost out the door
Dan
(
) Yeah
Dr
Sweeney
(worried) What's going on
Nothing here
Is everything all right over there
Everything's fine
How's it comin'
'm doing it right now
Who is it, dude
(covering the receiver) It's Sweeney
Who
Why is he calling here
Fuck you, Sweeney
Asshole
(grabbing the receiver) Get a fucking job, you reggie
Danny grabs the receiver back and yells at his friends
You fuckers are going to get me booted
(into the receiver) Dr
Sweeney
'm sorry, man
Just make sure it's on my desk tomorrow, Danny
It'll be there, alright
It better be
Sweeney hangs up abruptly
Danny slams the phone on the hook, gives it  , and looks at his friends
Let's go
: '   - sits across the street
- They sit in the car as a band  from Cam's house
Shiftless Seth throws on a black - t-shirt and tosses his work shirt in the back
He wolfs down a burger as Derek rolls his foot on a basketball on the floor
You're an idiot if you ask me
'm not asking you
What if he writes something stupid and that nigger turns you in
Jesus
He didn't testify, Der
They can use that shit and re-try you
Derek takes a long stare at Seth, who devourshis burger
Sweeney's not gonna do anything, Seth
He helped get me released
Seth is a pathetic vision to Derek
Derek stares at him for several moments
'm out, Seth
Seth wipes his mouth and casually meets eyes with Derek
'm only going to tell you this once so pay attention
'm done, Seth don't want you to come near me
near Dan
want you to leave my family alone
Seth stares and laughs at Derek
You're serious
'm dead fucking serious
No more phone calls, no more visits, no more nothing
Seth doesn't know what to say
We don't exist as far as you're concerned, Seth
can't believe 'm hearing this shit come out of your mouth
Believe it, Seth
Believe it spent over three years away from my family
My family, Seth
For what
For your country, fuckhole, that's what
'd do a hundred years before felt like that
Seth gets out, slams the door, and walks to the party
You're a motherfucking traitor
Derek stares out the window and sighs
- ' He watches the house
Suddenly, Danny, Chris and Jason skate up to the residence and follow Seth inside
What the--
Shit
'  - : plays a punk version of   as skins slam dance
'   - His face is tattooed with crow's feet and prison ink
, a frail, older, English woman with green hair and multiple piercings, approaches  at the keg
You're full of shit
If he ain't here, he's comin'
- Chris, Danny and Jason pound beer and huck  at a picture of
Seth violently slams past the kids
Derek walks in
Yo
What's up, Fat Seth
Seth throws Chris against the wall
'm not fat, cockwart
'm husky
Okay
'm sorry, bro
Take it easy, dude
Seth then grabs Danny hard by the shirt
Chris and Jason stare at him like he's gonna hurt him
What're you doin'
Your brother's a piece of shit
Seth sees Derek enter and he releases Danny
Seth mixes into the party and   into ten other skins
Danny follows Seth towards the keg
'
He analyzes the crowd
Quickly, Chris recognizes him
Holy shit
Father Vinyard
Son of a bitch
Derek looks at the two kids
'm Jason and that's Chris
We're friends with your brother
They stick out their hands but Derek prefers to check the scene
You're a fuckin' god, man
No shit
Do me a favor
Grab Danny and get outta here
The two boys look at each other and
We just got here, man
You what
Chris looks at Derek like he's dead
You don't have any homework
School doesn't exist anymore, Father
Derek stares at him, not really knowing what to do
wrote you
Two letters while you were in there
Did you get them
Derek ignores them and weaves his way through the crowd, causing many an individual to double-take
Chris and Jason look on in wonderment
,    - ALEXANDEr
The older, white trash skin furiously bangs his sticks on the drums to the song
Cam's hair is still long but now he's got a swastika between his eyebrows like
He wears '   and a
'
He pans right to check out the crowd man pisses out the window
Then to a distinct woman
'
Her head is now completely  but she's still gorgeous as ever
Derek indulges her for a few moments until he turns and walks away
He bumps into a girl and knocks her drink
Excuse fuckin' me
Sorry
She smiles at Derek as the  comes to a close

, the -16 on the side of his head perfectly intact, walks by Derek
He walks past Derek with his young son on his shoulders
hope what  heard ain't true, man
You better hightail it the fuck outta here if it is
After a moment, Derek looks away and Curtis heads off
You gotta chop that mop, Der
Cassandra lights a brown menthol cigarette
(exhaling) Stacey's meandering around here somewhere
Have you seen the bitch
Derek shakes his head
The only person 've seen is Seth
Oh God
'm sorry
'
He sees Cameron puts his arm around her and kiss her
Cameron sticks his hand down the back of her pants, smiles, pulls it out, and licks his finger
Derek watches as Danny delivers a beer to Cammeron
Ca puts his arm around Dan and they go into the bedroom
Stacey looks at Derek and follows them
(0
) Are you going in there
Derek looks down to see Lizzy and Kammi
Can you tell Danny that Lizzy's looking for him
Derek can only stare at the girl's youth
/ - ' PoV
He stands in the doorwell and listens
White Power paraphernalia cover the walls
Articles, posters, everything
The room has a bed, a couch, a glass coffee table and a desk with a computer on it
Organized stacks of papers, pamphlets and magazines are strewn throughout the floor
Cameron sips a beer and talks with Dan
Stacey listens in the background
He won't do anything'drastic  hope
gotta do that paper though
thought you already turned that fucker in
My teacher cried to Sweeney, man
have to do another one
Cammeron laughs
Oh man
Fucking Sweeney
(chiming in) Meanwhile, niggers and spics do their reports on Malcolm  and fucking Fidel Castro
Cameron laughs again but then becomes quickly serious
Sweeney's got an agenda, Danny
And it's all a load of crap
You hear me
He's all about brainwashing
Don't get fucking fooled by it
(
) What the hell are you doing here, Dan
They all look over
(smiling) Hey
was wondering when he was going to show his face
Derek doesn't lift his eyes from Danny
What did  tell you, Dan
had to check it out, Der
Come on
He'll be all right, Derek
Derek shoots Cameron a look and tries another way
There's a redhead out there looking for you
Go talk to her
Danny gets up and walks out
Cam looks to Stacey
You go with
Derek seizes his brother with the eyes as he exits
Then Stacey
Welcome back
He just closes the door on her
Cammeron looks for his cigarettes
You made it, man
When  heard they threw you in General Population thought it was curtains
It wasn't too bad
So what's all this self-righteous, born-again shit 'm hearing then
Derek doesn't blink
Cameron smiles and points to a chair
Have a seat, Derek
Relax
He sparks up a cigi to break Derek's uncomfortable stare
How was it in there with all those fuckin' monkeys, man
You're lucky they didn't kill you
agree
Who runs the place
The monkeys or the wetbacks
The Mexicans
It's a fuckin' vacation for them in there, hunh
They were really organized

They-- - : The two make out
She sits on the sink and wraps her legs around him
They stop and smile at each other
like you

: - Derek and Cam converse over the coffee table
They're fuckin' peasants, Derek
All of them
(then) So what's up, man
'm hearing a lot of shit about you
Be careful with me, Cam
You don't know what's going on with me
Fuckin' talk to me then
We're family here
Let's work it out whatever it is
'm family, Cam
Is that why you came to see me all the time up there
Cameron smiles but doesn't know what to say
had to distance myself from you after that
Fuck you, Cameron
You're a fucking chicken hawk
praying on kids
don't pray on fucking anyone
No
You fucking use them
To filter your insanity
Cameron smiles in disbelief
You and Danny are like brothers to me, Derek
Come on, man
He's not your brother, Cameron
All right
He's my brother
(after a beat) You hear me, Cam
(exploding) Fuck you, Derek
Fuck you
Don't think you can threaten me with this shit for a fuckin' second
'm more important to him now then you ever were
Derek
With his feet, he pushes the hard into Cammeron's knees
Cam screams in agony
Derek  him in the face and Cam with two of his own
They wrestle around the room and push their way into the
- Derek takes Cam by his long hair and  his face into the mirror
Derek follows with a solid punch to the kidney
You gonna listen
'm gonna fuckin' kill you
Derek bangs Cam's face against the mirror
Shut the fuck up
You're gonna stay away
That's what you're gonna do
Derek rinses Cam's bloody face off by  it into the toilet
He pulls him back up and they face the mirror
It's over
Derek stares at him in silence
He forcefully backs Derek into the wall behind him
He throws two punches at Derek -- one in the stomach and one to the face that opens his lip
He misses on his third and Derek gets the upper hand
Derek prepares to crash Cam's face into the shards of glass one last time
The final blow
As Cam screams, Derek launches him forward then pulls back at the very last moment
Derek, noticing Cam's condition, throws him into the tub
Derek throws him a towel, grabs one for his lip, and exits
-    20 ' They  the band and chant as they tune up for another set
The singer inquires about his
Derek pushes his way through and spills a few beers cn the way
Cassandra smokes a cigarette with a few random skins as Derek passes by
Hey Derek
What
(exhaling) Jesus, Der
What happened
(psychotically) Where's Cammeron, man
haven't seen him
Cassandra looks at him curiously and then focuses her attention to the bedroom
(/) Hey
Derek turns around and faces her
(pointing his finger) Stay away from me
Don't point your fucking finger at me
'm serious, Stacey
Stay away
She grabs and pulls on his shirt
What are you gonna do
Hunh
Hit me
Kick me as  roll on the fuckin' ground screaming
(then) That bullshit with Cammeron is nothing, Derek
don't care
Stacey looks deep into his eyes and can feel it
Goddamn you, Derek
Those two niggers deserved what they got
They deserved to die
And just like Cameron and Seth and a million others out there
'll believe that 'til the day fucking die
will
Nothing will ever change that either
Derek breaks from her grasp and walks away
- ' He looks over to the kegs
Through the sliding glass window, he sees Seth taking a "tap hit" off the keg
All the guys in the b
g
,  , count and cheer
Seth sucks the tap while skins count in the background
Derek walks out and watches Dan pump the keg
Forty-five
Forty-six
Forty- seven
Seth removes his mouth from the tap and belches like a pig
All the guys laugh
(grabbing Danny) Why the fuck did you pump it coulda gone for a minute at least
Danny looks over and meets eyes with a bloody Derek
He while everyone turns to look Derek over
Let him go, Seth
Seth sees blood on Derek's face and shirt and takes a moment to identify the source
He draws his 9mm Baretta and points it at Derek's head from four feet away
Where's Cameron
Derek stares directly into the
(frightened) Seth, man
Come on
Seth puts the gun directly to Derek's cool head
'd be doing America a great fucking favor, let me tell you
Do it, Seth
Seth glances at her and Derek quickly  the pistol
shot goes off and people hit the deck
Derek wrestles the pistol away and punches Seth in the
Falling to the ground in pain, Derek cracks him in the face once more and it's over
'  - They walk in and look at Cammeron, bleeding in the tub
Curtis pulls the    off the wall and storms after Derek
Cassandra laughs
You got fuckin' guests out there, Cam
- Derek tosses the gun over the fence and looks to Danny
Come with me right now
He looks at his brother
He then sees Curtis and three other skins come through the house
Derek stares at Dan and hauls ass down the back alley
'
Curtis arrives and tends to Seth rather than go after Derek
Confused and mildly embarrassed, Danny bolts back into the house to get his board
: - Danny passes them on his board as he conguers the cracks in the street at an incredible rate
He turns the tight corner and cuts off a turning car
The man yells
Danny spots his brother walking twenty yards up on the left-hand side of the street and crosses
Approaching quickly, he skates faster and faster as Derek nears a Hearing the board, Derek turns to face the clickity clack behind him
The two crash into the street as a car henks from the inside lane, barely missing the duo
Danny punches his brozher in the face
Fucking asshole
Derek gets on top of his brother, spots a speeding car heading right for him, and pulls his brother to the sidewalk
Just in time
What the luck are you thinking
What are you thinking
Friends don't fight friends, Der
They stick together
They're not friends, Dan
What the hell are they then
Derek picks his brother up and sits him on a Just sit there and relax for a second
don't wanna relax
You looked like an idiot back there
Derek stares and sits next to him
Cars and homeless randomly pass in the b
g
Danny looks at his brother, transfixed in thought
What's happened to you, Derek
He looks into his brother's eyes
: /
- The morning drill
His roommate, an old Latino guy, right behind
Derek's eyes cast among the inmates, noting everyone and looking for a friendly face
He notes a familiar tattoo, catches the guy's eye and nods
Derek with his tray
sea of tables divided by race
He spots a tiny island of white guys at a distant table
He looks at   , but gets a nod from the next to him
Derek moves to sit with them
From a distance, he approaches the Aryan corner
They casually greet each other
Derek then looks over to the from the cafeteria and to  , the crazy looking leader
Derek walks over and shakes their hands
: - Derek quietly folds towels with a young, chattering black man
You got lucky, man
was in the kitchen for a year before making it in here
Pots and motherfucking pans
disgusting beef stroganoff shit
boiling hot water
fuck that
(looking over) My name's Lamont, man
Derek doesn't even look at
Stone cold, he continues folding
got your back
Righteous white Cracker with attitude
Just like the Judge who sentenced me, man
Lamont laughs but then becomes serious
If your smart though you'll remember one thing
You're the nigger in here
Not me
: - '
He sees Stevie McCormick conferring with a Mexican gang leader
The Mexican hands Stevie a joint through a handshake
Derek turns and talks to two white guys who seem impressed
Stevie walks up and takes a hit off his joint
was just talking about you
You're Cammeron's boy
Derek turns and stares at him
His boy
No,  don't think so, man
'm not anybody's boy
Well
you know what  mean
Nooo,  don't know what you mean
Derek and Stevie lock eyes
Stevie sneaks a hit and offers Derek
Here, man
Relax and have a hit
Derek stares at him
Nooo
how about you getting that fucking shit awax from me
Stevie looks at him, ready to kill
The other two can't believe Derek's gall
Stevie shrugs
You got a problem, man
Excuse me
Do  have a problem
No, don't have a problem
Do you have a problem
No
don't
Stevie stares at Derek and walks off
He turns back again and he and Derek lock eyes
He walks back to his group
Who the fuck are you
Derek turns back to the other two and they are already walking away
Derek looks at the two and back to Stevie
Stevie sits with   and says something to him
: - Lamont in mid-conversation
But  won't go down on that shit
No way, no how
You ever been with a soul sister
Derek looks over and meets his eyes
Lamont sees this and laughs
Just for a second
Oh shit
Sorry, man
Forgot who the luck  was talking to there for a second
(after a beat) Let me ask you this one though cause don't know the white man's take
You like eating pussy
Derek can't help but smile
Oh man
You sick fucking bastard
You sick pig
And you don't
Shut up
Man
you don't know shit about the brothers
We won't go down on that shit if the bitch was holding a gun to our fucking head
Derek laughs and the two continue to converse
: - group of White Aryans are gathered in the yard
Derek plays basketball with a mixed assemblage, including Lamont
Derek continues to look over every now and then at Stevie and his group
Stevie suddenly smiles towards Derek
Not understanding what it's all about, Derek turns 'around
Standing there is   and his They proceed to beat the shit out of Derek right in the middle of the court
The players circle as Derek rolls on the ground
He gets bombarded with kicks and punches, a few even coming from randoms on the court
: - beat-up Derek quietly folds
Lamont stays quiet
He glances over but knows Derek isn't in the mood
: - Derek looks over to the white table and they something amongst themselves
They break into laughter
Derek thinks about eating somewhere else, but there's nowhere to go
He walks  over to the white table and looks at
How's your face, man
Everyone laughs
Derek sits and eats, his tail between his legs
That'll teach you
Don't be a prick to your superiors
: - Stevie walks by himself and smokes a cigarette
He turns a corner and standing there waiting for him is
Derek stares him down
What do you want
'm right here, man
You wanna have it out with me, let's go
Just me and you though
Man
you are a stupid motherfucker
You know that
When are you--
Derek cracks him in the face and Stevie falls to the ground
Stupid
You have anything else to say, you little pussy
Hunh
Fuck you
Derek kicks the man a few more times and takes off few black prisoners laugh at Stevie from the : - Derek puts his head down under the warm water and closes his eyes
From out of nowhere, he is slammed out of frame to the floor
'and his   from earlier proceed to beat him
Bathers leave and after a few moments, Stevie's boys drop their
Well well well
virgin
: - Derek lies on the tile floor, bloody and beaten
You ain't so tough now, are you
The two men smile at each other, kick him and exit
After a few seconds,  enters with the cart and picks up dirty towels
He spots Derek laying on the tile
Motherfucker
What now, man
He tends to Derek
He picks him up, throws him over his shoulder, and carries him off
Shit, holmes
(carrying him) Hang on to me, man
You're heavy
- Derek lies on a table, silent
Mexican  examines his ass
Well, you do have some tearing down here
Christ
Okay
'm gonna have to stitch you up so 'll be back
The doctor passes Dr
Sweeney on his way out
Derek hears Sweeney talk to the doctor and turns his head
The two look at each other for a long moment
Sweeney sits down next to him and puts his hand on Derek's shoulder
Derek finally breaks down and sobs
: - Sweeney and Derek in mid-conversation
small lamp shines off their faces
Honor and loyalty run thick, Derek
Not skin color
Skin is thin don't get you, man
don't
(after a beat) got my Doctorate in Education
not in medicine
But if you think babies come into this world evil
you're fucked up, Derek
You're way to smart to believe that shit
(then) There's nothin' more beautiful Derek, nothin' more pure, nothin' more innocent
than a baby
They killed my father, Sweeney
Jesus Derek
Use that brain God gave you for chrissake
What are you gonna do
Seek revenge your whole life and become a lifer in here
That's what these guys are like, you wanna be like them
Fucking little boys in prison
Think, man
None of your guys back home give a shit about you
(after a beat) They only care about your brother
The new blood
And he sure as hell can't take care of himself like you could
Derek looks at the man with regret
Get me outta here, Sweeney
Sweeney looks at the young man, heavily weighing his options
The two lock eyes
: - Derek reads by himself on the cement stairs by himself
shadow approaches from behind
How you doin', man
Derek turns his head and sees  standing there
All right
(after a beat) How are you
'm fucking incarcerated, man
With a bunch of faggots
How you think 'm doin'
Derek looks at the young man and can't help but laugh
Derek slowly gets up and limps past Lamont
What are you gonna do, man
Derek looks at him for a few moments, still shaken
'm not going to do anything
: He looks through the window at his mother
Together they pick up the phone
He can feel her pain more than he can feel his own
He forces a smile
Hey Mom
Hello
The two sit there and stare at each other for a few moments
Dr
Sweeney called me
He spoke with a guy on the parole board here
(then) He thinks you might be getting out soon
Derek nods and stares at his mother, broken
How are the others
Davina's good
Math major
(frustrated) All three of you have always been so great in school
wonder why all this-- What about Dan, Mom
How's he
He's doing the same stuff you were doing, Derek
Hanging out with Cammeron, getting into trouble
It brings back a lot of sad memories
And  can't do anything
he won't listen to me
He needs you
Derek stares at his mother like it's the last thing he wanted to hear
: - - Derek gives back his prison garb
Through the partition we see Derek say goodbye to Lamont: and walk out to his awaiting family
: -  - Danny tearfully stares at his brother, speechless
(after a long beat) You're my best friend, Danny
You're my only friend
And  just want what's best for you
The two rub heads as  puts his arm around him
Danny squeezes back and Derek kisses him on the top of the head
: - Danny skates up to the front gate and looks at them
#1 How the hell
Derek slaps the roof on the passenger side and scares the hell out of the officers
#2 Son of a bitch
Pretty shitty assignment you got
#1 Out of respect for your father
Oh yeah
What the hell do you know- about my father
The two men sit there speechless as Derek walks over to an awaiting Danny
- She snores on the couch
The clock on the wall reads eleven as the boys
Danny goes to his room whale Derek heads for the girls in the living room
He genzly shakes Davina
Hey
Wake up
She looks at him, delirious
What
Time for bed
- ' Dan types at the computer as Derek escorts Davina and Doris to bed
- Davina plops herself down and falls asleep instantly
Goodnight
Goodnight, Mom
: - Derek stares at himself in the mirror
million thoughts race through his head as computer keys echo in the b
g
He looks at all of his tattoos and
He stares at the  on his tit
He puts his hand over the tattoo to see what he looks like without it
He turns on the shower and gets inside
129
- As he soaps himself down, the soap slips out of his hand and sits on
the bottom of the tub
He looks at it a long time before he bends over to pick it up
He immerses his face into the shower faucet and thinks to himself
- He sits back down at the computer and looks back at his brother as he dries off
Danny thinks to himself and types a sentence
(/) There was only one person who loved Derek more than me
: -  - The place is immaculate
, the father of the household, eats his breakfast in his Vintage fireman material: muscular, receding hairline, zero facial hair
Handsome
pretty and well-dressed Doris  while she scrambles eight eggs with mushrooms and peppers
(/) That was Dad
They were best friendS
Fathers and sons are never best friends
but they were
stares at his larger-than-life father with a cap turned backwards
Doris breaks from song and yells to the back
Breakfast
Okay
Let's go, Davina
Derek
So what's this all about, Dennis
Dennis doesn't hear because his attention is on Danny
, donning a flat-top haircut and no tattoos, walks into the kitchen
The smiling athlete has his backpack and blue   gym bag
He drops it all onto the ground and sits at the table
Good morning
Good morning
Doris sets food in front of her two sons and they both go to work
Young Danny eats quietly
What about this gang stuff
Jesus Doris
it's not that big of a deal
All departments have to take a precaution class on gang patrol today
What for
guy was shot yesterday in Inglewood
changin' a valve on a hydrant
is worried that more firefighters will become targets
That's what this bullshit is about
(sipping his coffee) good father this guy was though and now he's in intensive care because of some goddamn--
They've pretty much declared war on  and us
Why you guys though
can see them but the fire department
They think we would rather let a building burn down over there than fight it
So now we got two fights goin' on at one goddamn time
Dennis takes a bite of his eggs and explodes
(to the bedroom) Dayins
Get in here
(
) 'm coming right now
Jesus
'll tell you one more thing
This "affirmative blaction" shit is driving me up the fucking wall
Firefighters gettin' 99's on their tests while rappers who score a goddamn 62 walk away with the job
Don't we have to have "affirmative action
" Not when a job requires ability
No
lot of people say otherwise, Danny
Including me
lot of people don't know shit, either
Doris just stares at the back of her husband's head like she wants to smack it
He turns back and disarms her with a look
If 'm fightin' a brush fire
surrounded by thousand degree flames
who would  want watchin' my back
guy who scores a 99 or a guy who scores a sixty
(then) You don't see half the  with whites, gooks and spics
Nooo
what you don't see are minorities on the boards of Fortune 500 companies cause whites won't stand for it
Doris
'm tired of your damn argument
You sound like an idiot
Sweeney actually had a pretty good take on affirmative action the other day
(smiling) Really
didn't know you spoke "African", Derek
Where'd you learn that shit
Johannesberg
Dennis laughs and Derek eventually smiles
Danny looks at them, not really understanding
Doris stares down Dennis
Honey
Please don't speak that way
They don't-- How am  speaking, Doris
Hunh
'm speakin' fineP (quickly to Derek) Hey
Don't let that him confuse you over there, Derek
Look at me
This shit he's pulling is a load of crap
Hey
Look at me, Derek
mean it
If we keep givin' niggers everything, there'll be nothing left for us
Derek and Danny stare at their father, not knowing how to react
You can be a stupid son of a bitch sometimes
And then we have naive fools like her
really hate you with a passion some times
An upset Doris exits the room past
Dennis looks to Derek
You know what  mean though, right
(nodding) Yeah
(to the family) Good morning
She sits
Her lips glare excessively this morning
Well
good morning, Miss Monroe
(smiling) Look at you
You look like a star
like that color, Davina
Thanks You did like it
Dennis reaches over and wipes it off with his napkin
(whining) Come on, Dad
Yeah
Well you're lucky 'm letting you wear that crap on your eyes love you but you're too young
That sucks, man
It totally sucks
And we all sympathize with you, too
Everyone laughs but Dan, still shaken over his mother
(Shifting to Danny) You got practice today
Danny shakes his head no
Coach's sick
You wanna go to Der's game with me
Sure
(quickly to Derek} Santa Monica High tonight, right
Yep
Perfect
(to Danny) Ben'll whip us up a couple of double deckers and we'll head over
(smiling) Okay
Dennis smiles, reaches over with a fatherly hand, and messes up his hair
: -  - He stops typing and almost cries
He leans back in his chair and and stares himself in the side mirror
He feels his bald head, almost exploring
: '   - white homeless man in an   sits outside begging for change
Seth and Cameron, both beat-up, drunk and bloody, stare at the man

Seth turns his head and stares at the interracial couple
He turns back to Cam and sings a verse from the famous atevie Wonder song,
Cameron laughs
The black man turns and looks at the two
Can we help you with something
Do you have any questions about the menu
No questions
recommend either the "Big Ben Burger" or the "Chicken Taco Special
" Ben'll replace the dark meat with the white meat if you ask nicely

ain't your fucking pal first of all
Secondly
don't have problems

What a great idea
You got a clever little whatever it is there

Where do you assholes come from
What the luck difference does it make where we come from, bitch
'm from a place called America
place that used to be a nice place to live before it became fuckin' Africa-America

You got a fuckin' death wish, asshole
Do you
Make your move now if you do
If you don't

Derek slowly walks back into the bathroom to grab his towel off the floor
He looks at his   in the mirror and sighs to himself
He turns off the light and exits

It wouldn't irritate me so much if the ratio was a little more even
What's that

Almost all of those orange kid relationships are black man and white women and 'm fucking sick of seein' it
wouldn't mind so much if it were more even
Huge dicks, Cam
That's all it is
used to think that too but
it's gotta be more, man
It has to be more than the fact they they carry a big load
Chicks aren't that shallow, are they
It's politically correct
that's what it is
White women
bein' seen with the coloreds
it's great for their image
Bitches today want to be known as bein' fuckin' color blind

- She's on the couch watching cartoons
She takes a jar of Vick's Vapor Rub and puts some on her chest
Derek walks in the room, bends over and kisses her on the forehead
Davina sits on the couch and writes
Derek just smiles
Wow
What happened
gotta see my parole officer
Hey Der
Do you have Excel on disk
've got everything on disk
Davina smiles and walks into the back bedroom
Doris looks at Derek
You look good
Derek smiles and caresses his mother's cheek
We're getting out of here soon
Is that okay with you
'd love it
(after a beat) Do you think  should color my hair
Yes
He sits beside his mother and enjoys the moment
He thinks to himself
'm glad you made it back
wasn't too sure  was going to see you again
You know how  get
Filled with regret, he nods
You think you'll be able to forgive me
Someday maybe
You're my son
Of course  will
Derek smiles and can't believe his tearful reaction
Look at me
'm such a pussy
No you're not
: - Derek plunks a quarter down the slot and removes a copy of the
Danny continues to skate ahead of him
Sensing danger, Derek looks back behind him
With no one in sight, he walks into a doughnut shop
- ' He takes a guarded look outside
Everything seems normal
bus drives by
group of Mexican laborers, dressed for work and smiling, walk past in the other direction
Inside, a black woman orders a dozen doughnuts from a short Korean
man behind the counter
Her young daughter grabs her leg
Danny sits down and reads Derek's paper
What do you want
Maple bar and a
large milk
Derek smiles at the little girl while he waits
She wanders from her mother's leg and over towards Derek
(to the girl) You look pretty
She laughs
Thank you
How do  look
(bashfully) Fine
'
He looks up from the paper
He watches the girl together with his brother
What's your name
Tisha
How old are you, Tisha
She holds up four fingers
Derek smiles
(staring at Derek) Come here, Tisha
Tisha returns to her mother and they quickly exit
Derek watches the girl as she continues to stare at him as they make their way down the street
Outside, a   screeches out front
Rasmussen and the Young Mark Fuhrman type from earlier get out and wait
Dr
Sweeney meets the duo and together they walk inside
What's goin' on
We need to talk, Derek
How'd you find out  was here
We were just at your apartment
Cammeron and Seth are in the  at St
Johns, Derek
They were jumped in front of Ben's Burgets early this morning
Derek thinks to himself for a few more seconds
How bad
They'll live
(then) They must have been looking for somebody else
Derek stares at Rasmussen and walks away
Sweeney, who knows to walk over to him
He eyes The two lock eyes
Are they coming after you
Fuckin'
Sweeney sighs
don't know
(after a long beat) You might have to talk to your old crew though
Derek looks over and analyzes the innocence of his brother
can't, Sweeney
Try, Derek
Okay
Derek senses the danger in his voice
Okay
Before it explodes
Sweeney walks away and then turns back to Derek
And watch your back
Derek nods
(back to Danny) You showing up today
Danny looks at Sweeney and nods his head yes
Good
: - They are outside the fence surrounding the field
Students head off to morning class
Hey
Keep your head up, alright
'm going to take care of this
How
don't know
'll figure it out though
You gonna be okay
Yeah
The two stare at each other as
gotta turn that paper in
Danny hops the fence with his backpack on
He looks back at Derek
Cops #1 and #2 sit in their car in the b
g
Hey
What
Come here
Derek puts his hand over the fence
Danny walks up and clasps it --
Derek wants to say one thing but something else comes out
'll see you at home
Danny smiles at his brother and nods
Danny puts his ear phones on and heads to class
Derek watches his brother through the chain-link fence
Danny meets up with Lizzy and they soon disappear from Derek's sight
Derek turns and walks down the street
#1 You need a lift anywhere
Nope
Derek stops in his tracks, walks back over to the fence, and stares at the school
- Students rush past them
Danny kisses Lizzy and she hurries off to class
He pushes on the men's room door
- Danny enters, sets his "  "  on top of the sink, and takes an unearthly long piss at the urinal
He finishes, flushes and turns
Standing there is
Jesus Christ
What are you doing, Henry
(afraid) What does it look like 'm doin'
Come on, man, no
You don't want to do this
Come on
Henry
and Danny moves to grab the pistol
It discharges and a bullet rockets into Danny's chest
He  back into the  and gasps for air
The force of the pistol knocks Henry to the ground
The two kids who just entered bolt for help
Danny slides to the tile, leaving a bloody trail
The two stare at each other - falls into the
Danny inhales like glass is raking his lungs
(terrified) Danny
Danny's breathing slows to a choked whisper
He blinks, coughs, twitches
And dies
Vinyard
Danny
Henry watches teary-eyed with the same altered look Derek had after killing Lawrence
Together they  on the cold tile floor
: - Officers and detectives monitor the area
Young students, including Lizzy and her friends, stand around and cry
Rasmussen brings    over to Sweeney
Sweeney looks at it for a moment but is interrupted
He won't let go
Will you talk to him
- Derek cradles his bloody brother
Sweeney walks over, crouches, and talks to Derek's back
Derek
You gotta let him go, man
They gotta get him outta here
can't
Derek begins to cry outright
He can't control himself
He lets go of Danny's corpse and charges out into the hall
- Derek embraces them
Doris grabs his face -- torn between love and hate
Guilt-ridden, Derek tears from them and storms down the hall with Sweeney soon in tow
Derek
know what you're thinkin' right now and  want you to forget about it
How the luck do you know what 'm thinkin', Sweeney
Cause 'm thinkin' the same damn thing
Drowning in rage, Derek turns back to a misty eyed Sweeney
They shot him in a fucking
pisshole
And goin' after them won't bring him back
Don't do it, Derek
Please, man
You've come too far
The war is over
Derek contemplates the situation and presses his tongue against his teeth, crackbrained
Sweeney slowly approaches and cautiously wraps his arms around the young man
Derek buries his tearing face in Sweeney's shoulder
It stops now, Sweeney
Sweeney nods and the two lock eyes
Derek makes his way back to Doris and Davina and together, they grieve
(/) We've heard it a million times, a Bible quote become cliche: "Vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord
" : - still of the two immediately after the murder
We move in tighter and tighter until we get close on Danny
(/) Vengeance brought about by hate
and fear
When it points its head in our direction, we take notice and everything changes
The way we choose our friends, the way we protect our families, the way we create enemies out of strangers
(then) Welcome to America

They are gently pushed shut by Henry's two small
