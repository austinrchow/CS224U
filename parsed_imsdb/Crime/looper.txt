Written by Rian Johnson Production draft - pocket watch
Open
Ticking
Swinging from a chain
Held by a young man named  in a clearing beside a Kansas corn field
Sky pregnant with rain
Waiting
He checks the watch, removes his earbud headphones, stands
Without much ceremony a   in a suit appears from thin air, kneeling before the young man
Hands and feet tied
Burlap sack over his head
Muffled screams, gagged
With no hesitation Joe raises a squat gun and blows the man apart with a single cough of a shot
Joe loads the corpse into the flatbed of his truck
Cuts open the back of the body's jacket, revealing  bars of gold taped to the dead man's back
Joe takes them
- Massive, in the middle of nowhere
Black smoke
(
) Time travel has not yet been invented
But twenty five years from now it will be
Once the technology exists, it will be relatively cheap and available to the public at large
And so
It will be instantly outlawed, used only in secret by the largest criminal organizations
And then only for a very specific purpose
Joe drives up and parks his truck, removes the wrapped corpse from the flatbed
(
) (') It's nearly impossible to dispose of a body in the future
'm told
Tagging techniques, whatnot
So when these future criminal organizations in the future need someone gone, they use specialized assassins in our present, called loopers
- Cavernous and empty
Joe carries the body to an iron hatch, opens it, and dumps him in
2
(
) And so
Thirty years from now
My employers in the future nab the target, they zap him back to me, their looper
And  do the necessaries
So the target has vanished from the future, and 've just disposed of a body that technically does not exist
Clean
The body slides down a long chute
Vanishes in a little flare of angry red fire
- sidecar roadside diner in the middle of nowhere
Joe's truck in front
Nearly empty, Joe at a booth listening to headphones waitress sets down coffee
Her bright red name tag:
Bon jour, Joe
Bon jour, Beatrix
How's the French
Slow
How's the coffee
Burnt
Cream in the coffee
White clouds boil deep down
- Joe's truck zooms from the flat fields towards a mid sized city on the horizon
- Grungy, heavily fortified
Joe enters and puts his gun in a basket labeled aLOOPERS - BLUNDERBUSSESa Slips down a narrow passage, which ends at a steel wall with a protruding duct taped camera and microphone
Two, Jedd
3
Joe fishes the two gold bars from his jacket
small narrow slot slides open in the wall, and gnarled old hands take the gold bars
It slides shut again
In the background the front door to the pawn shop dings open
The slot slides open and Jedd's hands push a wad of cash
Joe pockets it, and backs around Dale, another Looper
Hey Joe
Be at the Belle tonight
Yup
Dale hands four gold bars through the slot as Joe retrieves his gun and exits
Four, Jedd
'  - High ceilings, big clean windows overlooking a sooty city
Joe finishes smoothing out an oriental rug and scoots a coffee table in place over it
Puts a bebop  on a turntable
On the bed, shooting at the ceiling with his fingers
Bon jour, mademoiselle
Bang
- Suit-and-tie Joe pulls a tarp off a cherried-out 1992 Mazda Miata
Lingers over it
His baby
- Joe drives through the sooty city streets
muted beep, and he fishes a matchbook sized screen from his pocket
Yeah Seth
Yeah
Ok

- young looper named  on the side of the road, kneeling beside a motorcycle without wheels called a
He kicks it in frustration
approaches and  pulls a gun, identical to Joe's
Walk around
Around, 'm not kidding
Wide around, ya shit
The vagrant crosses the street
Joe pulls up
Seth
Hi Joe
That's new
Seth kicks the bike
Thanks
Goddamn thing
You going to the Belle
Seth and Joe
Slat Bikes are all junk
Stick with rubber on the road
Yeah but Gat Men pull up in them, they get respect
They get respect cause they run the town
How much did that thing set you back
How much
Seth holds a quarter idly in his palm
was gonna pull up in it
Tonight
Heads or tails, call it in the air
The coin lifts, floats several inches in the air, quivering
5
Congratulations
You're pulling up with me instead
Joe notices the floating quarter
(') And don't, if we're going in, don't do that
Chicks dig TKs
It's tacky, don't do it
Seth catches the quarter, sullen
(
) (') When the  mutation started appearing in the general populace it was on every magazine - aNext Step in Evolution, what's next
a Everyone got tested
But turns out this was it, and now it's just a bunch of assholes thinking they're blowing your mind by floating quarters
- shitty but bright nightclub in the heart of the city
Flashy people shiver behind a velvet rope, huge black cars, big rollers in odd suits swept in by the bouncers
All trying very hard to be big time
(
) Big heads
Small potatoes
Drives past, revving the engine
Down the street
Joe tosses the keys to an attendant
dingy stage door in back of the building
Joe and Seth ring a buzzer, smile for a camera, and the door opens
long dark hallway leads to a tiny antechamber with a coat check room used for guns
leans out of it, and stops the two
6
No loopers in the club on Wednesdays, Joe
Gat men only
Seth backs towards the door, Joe stops him
We'll stick backstage, just meeting up
In and out
Packing your blunderbusses
Hardly
Right Seth
Hardly
'm with Joe
Big Craig pats them down, waves them in
claustrophobic maze of twisty halls and passages
and half naked   weave through
Joe expertly navigates the turns, going someplace
Seth struggles to keep up
So are we - hey - Joe has vanished
Seth stops meekly, butted by passing men
An ornate parlor,   entertaining men
velvet curtained doorway leads to back rooms
Joe lingers by the entrance, watching one girl in particular, Bold dark eye makeup
leads her off through the curtains
Joe's eyes drop
Pained
fat  doesn't look up from her ledger
No loopers on Wednesday, Joe
Gat Men only
So 've read
He ducks out
7
Joe plods
Dale, the Looper from the pawn shop, passes fast
Curious, Joe follows
They pass Seth, who tails after them
Hey, Joe
We leaving
Cuz, what- Joe
And Seth loses them again, butted back by passing men
starkly lit steep stairwell leads down
Five or six young loopers gather at the top
Joe and Dale join them
What
Zach
In there right now, with Abe
Dale makes a quarter float above his palm
Joe rolls his eyes
For what
He closed his loop
This lands heavily on Joe
No shit
The door at the bottom of the stairs opens, and , another looper, steps out
An  '  pats his shoulder then retracts into the door
The loopers watch him in awe
(
) (') There's a reason we're called loopers
-  () Zach stands waiting, checking his wristwatch, gun in hand
Obviously performing a similar ritual to Joe's
(
) Time travel in the future is so illegal, that when we sign up for this job we agree to a very specific proviso
8
Zach raises his gun
(
) (') If our employers in the future get busted up by the law, their first priority is going to be erasing any trace of their relationship with us ever existing
flash of light, and a    with a sack over his head kneels in front of Zach
Zach fires, and the man's chest explodes
(
) (') So
If they're busted, and if we're still alive 30 years from now, they'll find our older self and zap him back to us, like any other job
Zach rips open the back of the corpse's jacket, revealing several dozen gold bars taped to his back
(
) (') This is called closing your loop
Zach freezes
Looks at the shape of the corpse's face through the sack
(
) (') And you get paid out a mythic amount of money, and you get a handshake and get released from your contract
Enjoy the next 30 years
Zach reaches the top of the stairs, a grin on his face
(
) This job doesn't tend to attract the most forward thinking people
So are we celebrating
At the bottom of the stairs, a skinny young thug in ratty jeans
This is
No loopers on fucking Wednesdays
The loopers collectively flip him off
9
Suck one, kid
- Lurid and very loud mixture of a dance club and cabaret
One by one the  emerge from side exits, sneaking in
Paupers at the feast
- Joe and several other Loopers pass around an
Pupils slacken
The drug spins him into a slurred revelry
Joe staggers out on the dance floor
Miles high
- Joe and the loopers are kicked out by burly  , followed by Kid Blue, pointing and yelling at them
The loopers laugh their asses off
- Joe's Miata screams through the abandoned city streets, racing with several other loopers in trucks and sports cars
Jammed with Seth and Loopers, Joe at the wheel
Still so high
Suddenly one of the Loopers  -- Joe slams the - Screaming to a halt just shy of a malnourished
Caught in the headlights
Behind him, a miserable vagrant village in a field
Joe stares at the kid, frozen
moment
Then spins the wheel, peels out
The Loopers hoot and shout
Joe's Miata screams along the dirt road bordering the vagrant village, whizzing past open fires and dirty huddled families
'  - serene and focused
Going somewhere
'  - Joe drops Seth off at his building with its bright red garage
10
Sell that goddamn slat bike back
That's a lot of stupid money
got stupid money
Seth holds his hand under fuzzy dice hanging from Joe's mirror, and they spin
Alright
Seth stumbles toward his door, checks his pants
think  did something
You know what
TKs are special
Fuck you
Hey Seth
Seth slumps against the car
(') Alright, Zach
What's his payout, 30
40
If that
That's not going to last you 30 years
And it won't get you overseas
Overseas
So in five, ten years you're back to riding the rails, or worse you're like Kid Blue, working as a gat man, wagging your dick at loopers and roughing up shop clerks for payoff money
Fuckin Kid Blue
Save a little something
Alright
Cause that'll be yours, and then you've got yours and that's all that matters, your life is your own
gots mine you gots yours
wish was smart like you
Saint Joe
Seth pats Joe's cheek, and waddles off towards his apartment
11
'  - An alarm wakes Joe, red-eyed
'   - In his bathrobe, Joe checks his apartment mailbox
slip of folded paper inside, with a14:30a handwritten on it
' Dressed now, Joe double-checks his french book for a phrase and heads out
- Joe's truck zooms away from the city, into corn fields
Joe's pocket watch at 2:29, ticking away
hog-tied  with a sack on his head appears before Joe
Shoots the man in the chest, without hesitation
- Joe sits at a booth, the waitress Beatrix brings his coffee
Bon jour Joe
Ravi de te voir, Beatrix
Ooh la la
- , 70s and knarled, sits in a tiny closet of a work room
Following a , Joe appears on a fuzzy monitor, standing in the hall
( ) Two, Jedd
Jedd opens a slot and takes two gold bars from Joe, then hands him out a small stack of cash
Marks in a notebook Joe's name, the date and the number a 2'
All the other transactions have the number a 4'
' Joe smooths out the oriental rug
12
- Joe drinks with Dale, watches a group of Loopers celebrating at another table
What's that, fourth loop closed this month
Dale casually makes a fork float above his palm, lifting his eyebrows at passing ladies
Fourth
On the stage, flinging her legs with a line of can-can dancers, is Suzie
The girl Joe watched in the bordello
As her dance ends Joe stands and goes backstage
Suzie weaves towards her dressing room
Joe catches her
Hey
You working a shift tonight
Yeah
() Yeah, but one of the gat men bought me out already
For the night
Oh
Sweetie
gotta work
She leaves him watching her go
He turns - sees Kid Blue leaning in the shadows
He's seen this whole exchange
The Kid smirks
Joe bursts back into the club with a vengeance
'  -  - Joe staggers in
Not doing so hot
13
'  - Looks at himself in the mirror
Eyes red as candy
He pops open a hidden drawer next to his medicine cabinet, pulls out an eye dropper and puts one in each
'  - harsh
Joe, flopped on the bed, stirs
Then wakes with a jump, shaky on his feet
Goes to the door
screen shows nobody in the hall outside
Still punch-drunk, Joe listens
The window
Joe slides it open
Seth tumbles in off the fire escape
Jesus, Seth
They're gonna be here any minute, are they here
No, they're not here
Who
Christ
Joe
Christ
Joe's eyes focus a bit, he tunes in to the situation
Turns the apartment lights off
(') (re: the lights) What are you doing
Right
Smart
Seth, sit down here
Seth knocks something over in the dark
Joe opens the fridge, pale light
Seth sits at the kitchen table
Late to my own funeral
Mom always said
Tell me now
Christ, Joe
Late to my own goddamn funeral
Can you help me
14
Seth, what did you do
You can protect me a little, right
Just so they don't
jeez
Oh jeez
This is like a nightmare
This is a nightmare
(
) knew then what he did so  don't know why  asked
(') What did you do
Seth lifts his eyes to Joe
He was singing
-  () : a hog-tied man with a sack over his head appears
Singing
Seth, with his gun raised, hesitates
(
) Through the gag and mask, but could hear the tune
Deep memories, my mom in a dark room, singing
Back warm and safe, when coulda still been good
And once knew it was him
Joe couldn't
couldn't
had to see
Seth pulls the sack off the man's head
' Joe  can't even tell you
Looking in his eyes
had to let him talk, then
don't even remember the words, but  remember believing every one of them, or not even believing, but submitting
've never felt that small before
've never felt that happy
He told me
remember, there's a new holy terror boss-man in the future, and he's closing all the loops
The Rainmaker, they call him
He told me
() 15
(') Then he wanted a cigarette and untied him, and he gives me this look
And he just starts running
-  () Seth standing with his gun in his limp arm, receding behind us as we run away
(
) And  had my blunderbuss so  know he's got about fifteen strides till he's out of my range
And they come and go, and  just watch him till he's gone
' Seth breaks down crying
(
) This is called letting your loop run
It's not a good thing
What do  do
You're the only friend  got Joe you gotta help me You fucking idiot coming here
Seth, sucker punched
(') You can't be here, 'll give you a little money but you gotta Joe
little - where am  gonna - You hop a freight train, you beat it the hell out On the door this time
Seth makes a sound like he's going to die, Joe closes the fridge, hisses (') Shut up
Don't move
Goes to the door
Two   and Kid Blue stand outside
Open up Joe
(to the gat man) Watch the window
16
Joe spins from the door
Considers briefly
can't do anything for you Seth
Seth crumples to his knees, grasping Joe's hand
No
You gotta hide me
Joe, hide me, please Christ please Joe please hide me tell em something to buy time and 'll leave please- Hold on
Watching Seth, Joe's face breaks in a moment of decision
He flips the lights on, and briskly pulls back his oriental rug
with a touch pad
He enters a code, opens it
Wide and deeper than you'd expect, lined with gold bars
Big enough for a man
Seth scrambles in
Joe takes one last look at Seth's frightened, grateful face, framed by the gold bars, then closes the safe and smooths the oriental rug
- Joe opens the door
Kid Blue storms in, his gun drawn, sweeping through the apartment with over-eager purpose
One gat man stays outside, the other casually sits at Joe's kitchen table
Kid Blue gets in Joe's face
That took awhile
You think it's easy looking this good
Tye's going to watch your apartment while we go have a talk with Abe
Joe grabs a jacket
There's coffee in the tin
Thank you
-  - 17
Kid Blue leads Joe down the stairs and into the door at their base
Dingy with a few benches
In one wall three steep stairs lead to a high door
Kid Blue knocks
Muffled voice from : (
) Two minutes
Joe and Kid Blue on benches, facing each other
The Kid stares daggers and spins his gun
Joe tries his best not to engage
You know why they call that pea shooter a blunderbuss
Cuz it's impossible to hit anything farther than 15 feet, and impossible to miss anything closer
gun for fuck up turkeys
Not like a gat
gat has range
Accuracy
His gun spinning gets fancier
His gun meaner looking than Joe's blunderbuss, long and slim and chrome
Alright, cut it out Kid
You're gonna blow your foot off again
The Kid almost snaps back, but then grins
You're right, it'd be real easy for it to accidentally go off
He clicks the safety off
Joe shifts uncomfortably
'mon
Don't disrespect a gat man, Looper
Joe stifles a chuckle
In a flash, the Kid stands and pistol-whips him across the face
Joe falls back
The Kid raises his gun at Joe
Frozen in that tableau a moment, the Kid savors his victory
Lowers his gun
18
(
) What the hell is going on out there- The high door swings open fast,  Kid Blue hard on the side of the head
His gun goes off, firing into the wall
Out of nowhere three gat men burst into the room, guns drawn
, a sallow man in his 50s, appears in the high doorway
'alright, s'alright
Humiliated, the Kid tries to stand, but falls over again
After a moment everyone realizes what's happened, and the tension breaks
Alright
Joe
Joe climbs into the doorway
Kid Blue stands shakily
(') You didn't shoot your other foot off, didja kid
The door closes, and the gat men laugh at the Kid
' Cluttered, with a big desk
Joe sits, Abe hands him a handkerchief for the ugly gash on his cheek
My great grandfather always told my grandfather, men's like spiders
It's the little ones you gotta be careful of
Dunno  agree with that
Oh yeah
Well
What the fuck did my great grandfather know
(
) This man is from the future
He was sent back here by the mob, a one way ticket, to run the Loopers
That's low effort even for Abe, so to pass the time he recruited some real muscle, the Gat Men
Now he runs the city
Any other city, that'd be impressive
Abe settles in his chair
Regards Joe
19
How can you kids stand those chokers
This, the cravats
Ties
Ridiculous
You're aware we don't have a dress code
() Fashion
You know, you don't know, the movies you're dressing like were copying other movies
Goddamn 20th century affectations, do something new
Put a glowing thing around your neck or use
rubberized
(waves at Joe's suit) Be new
Okay
beat of silence
(') Well it was nice chatting with you Abe
do like you, Joe
But we're sure enough Seth paid you a visit we're gonna hafta do something about this
Seth
You're expecting we're gonna break your fingers with a hammer or something awful, and 'm going to diffuse that tension right now, that isn't going to happen
What's going to happen is, 'm going to talk for a little, not even that long, then you're gonna give up your friend
My friend Seth
'm confused
20
Well then 'll talk a little
You know you were the youngest looper ever hired
You looked goddamn ridiculous they said, the blunderbuss up to here on you
But remember they brought you in, forget what it was for, Watch shop
That's yeah, you had rolled one of our fronts, a watch shop
And they had you, your arms pinned, this kid
Like an animal
But you looked at me, your hair stuck to half your face so just this one eye looking at me
And  thought what's this kid lived through, what he had taken away from him
What's he lost
And  could see, like seeing it happen clear as seeing it, the bad path in front of you, the bad version of your life
Like a vision  saw it happen, you turning bad
So  cleaned you up and put a gun in your hand
gave you something that was yours
You know 'm grateful, Abe
Genuine
But Abe shakes his hands, not where he's going
gave you something that was yours
And  remember that kid, and  think when you ask yourself you ask who would  sacrifice for what's mine,  think Seth is deep and cozy inside that circle
Pause
Both their eyes go to a hammer sitting on the desk
(') That hammer's there for something else later, that's not, it's a bad coincidence
Okay
Show you how much  know you, 'm not even gonna break you, just set you back a ways
() 21
(') We know you've been stashing half your bars
Which is smart
You give up Seth, or you give us half your stash
For Seth
Joe holds Abe's gaze for a moment, then his eyes drop and it's over
Will you kill him
No
Would be too cataclysmic a change to the future
What we'll do is dangerous in that regard, but not as dangerous as killing him, and not by twice as having him run free
() Joe  let him run more than a few days, the boys in the future get nervous, then bing
my replacement shows up
With a gun
So we'll do what we have to do
Silence
Floor safe, beneath the rug
6742
One of the gat men quietly exits
It's the little ones that get you
Abe leads Joe out, past gat men and Kid Blue, smirking again
Why don't you kill an hour, Joe
On the house
After Joe exits, Abe and Kid exchange looks
(') Call the doc
Joe slumps in
Several girls, none of them Suzie
Suzie's just getting off
Doubt she's up for it
He pushes through the velvet curtained door
22
large gat man pushes past Joe
At the end of the hall, Suzie leans in a doorway smoking a cigarette
Not sexy, just tired
She sees Joe, and is about to say no
But she sees Joe's eyes, and doesn't
Exhaling a plume of smoke, she withdraws into her doorway
Joe follows
Through her smoke
'  - Suzie naked at the mirror
She goes to Joe, lying on the bed, distant
can't remember my mother's face
remember her touching my hair
Like this
He takes Suzie's hand strokes it over his hair
She smiles briefly, tired, then takes her hand away and puts drops in his eyes
(') Do you want to go overseas
Do  want to go overseas
With you
Now
Soon, maybe
Baby that's sweet
You're a sweet boy
You gotta be careful, it's easy to think you know someone once you been like this
What's in here is services rendered
Is that how it aughta be
What, in nature
() You know  get this a lot
Especially young guys
must have wife eyes or something
His face clouds
23
'  - Joe gets home
Empty, quiet
Everything in place
He goes to the rug, pulls it aside
Opens the safe
All the gold, and nothing else
One bar juts from the side, knocked out of place
He pushes it back, and when he lifts his fingers they have a bright smear of fresh red blood
- hunched figure sprints through an abandoned lot towards a train yard
It is a 55
He limps up to a razor-wire fence bordering the train yard
Surveys the sharp wire, rips the lining from his jacket and wraps first his left hand then his right
But stops
On the palm of his right hand, a
Clearly carved in the shape of an arrow, pointing down to his wrist
Old Seth squints at it, confused
He pulls back his sleeve, revealing his clean bare forearm
Then his face changes
Because his arm is no longer bare
Suddenly, out of nowhere, more intricate scarring has appeared down its length
The scars spell out clearly: aBE  75    15 Old Seth's breath returns, jagged
He pulls his sleeve up and hoists himself up the fence, climbing fast
He reaches the top, gets a good grasp on the wire to hoist himself over
and stops again
His right hand is missing a finger
The ring finger is just gone, its stump worn with age
Old Seth stares
And now his middle finger is gone as well
freight train whistle moans
The cars, open and inviting, leading out of town
Behind him, the city
Terror and indecision seizes his chest, so much so that it takes a moment for him to realize the sound of his breathing has changed to a ragged whistle
24
He lifts his hand, now with just two fingers, to his face
and the smooth scarred hole where his nose used to be
The train yard far in the distance
Old Seth  back into town
He looks down at his right hand, fingerless now but for his thumb
He speeds up, desperate
Cuts through an alley
And has no right hand, just a stump
No no no no no
bell-like
Old Seth spins, sees a   lying on the sidewalk
He picks it up with the four remaining fingers on his left hand, stuffs it in his pocket, sobbing
Bursts out of the alleyway, limping now, straight into the street and into the headlights of an oncoming car
The car screeches to a halt, and its harsh white light shows Old Seth's missing right ear, and deep scars down his face
Old Seth throws open the drivers side door and throws out the Jams on the gas
Speeding through the streets, hands slipping on the wheel
His pant leg crumples
Empty boot tangling with the pedals
The car hits a pole
Out climbs what's left of Old Seth, his face mangled, missing a foot, one arm gone to the elbow
Street sign -
The numbers, 45
He runs
Howling, missing his tongue
Arm totally gone
Then falls as his leg goes to the knees
And he's crawling, an animal form, bellowing wordlessly
Makes it to an iron street-side door
75
And with his one arm, slams it
Slumps against it, heaving
After a long moment it swings open
25
With no hesitation, a  from the darkened doorway, and Old Seth's head mists open
He slumps to the pavement
Kid Blue steps from the doorway, drags the body inside
Deep in the dark doorway we glimpse a  in a surgical frock smeared with bright red blood
The door
'  - Joe wakes with a start
Joe's pocket watch at 2:29, ticking away
He takes his stance
Earbud headphones, the drone of French lessons
hog-tied  with a sack on his head appears kneeling before Joe
Joe raises his gun without hesitation and shoots the man in the chest
Walks to the body, flips it
The man's hands, tied and purplish
Joe hesitates
Puts his hand next to them
Similar
He flips the man onto his back, stares long and hard at the shape of the man's face under the cloth sack
Tears it off
An older Asian man's face, frozen in terror
Joe smirks, the spell broken
His face hardens
- Joe watches the Asian man's body slide down the hatch and vanish in a puff of distant fire
: 1
Joe in the club, drinking, watching more loopers celebrate
2
Joe in the field, he shoots a hog-tied man
3
Joe in his floor safe, setting more gold bars
4
Joe in the field,
5
Joe in the club, watching Suzie with her red hair
6
Joe in the field,
7
In the plant, a body sliding into the fire
8
Joe in the field,
His face more determined with each shot
26
- Our montage comes to an end suddenly and all is silent
Joe in the corn field, in his stance, ready to draw
But nothing happens
Silence
Joe checks his watch, confused
2:30 and change
Waits
Watching the blank space where the man is supposed to appear
Hand on his gun
Breathing shallow
Something is wrong
2:32
An eternity
Then, there he is
But different
Not kneeling
On his side, so he flops over and has to straighten himself
The man's hands are
Holy shit
Joe raises his gun, scared
Time slows
Finger tightens on the trigger
Then he sees: the man has
And the face that stares back at Joe is his own
57
His eyes fixed on Joe
And for just one split second, Joe's face slackens, and his finger eases on the trigger
It's all the hesitation Old Joe needs
He throws his body into a spin
Joe snaps out of it, and
The shot catches Old Joe square in the back, and the impact blows him forward
But instead of blood beneath his torn jacket's back, we see the layered gold bars spill out
They caught the blast
In what seems like one fluid motion Old Joe's fingers grab one of the bars, he spins again, throwing handfuls of dirt and the bar back towards Joe
Joe flinches, again just for a moment, and when his eyes focus again and his arm steadies the gun it's too late
Old Joe is on top of him, with a heavy blow knocking the gun aside, and with an even heavier one swinging down on Joe's head, a fist and then , Joe wakes
Blood caked on his face
Headphones beside him, still squawking French lessons
Sits up
27
Oh god
Gold bars scattered in the dirt
But no Old Joe
And no truck
Joe staggers to his feet, shaky
Head thick
But realizing
(') Late to my own funeral
- Joe runs, shaky, towards town
Fishes his phone-device from his pocket, chucks it
'   - Across the street, Joe huddles behind a car, breathing hard
Looks up at his lit window
Debating
' Joe walks silently towards his apartment door
It is ajar
He hesitates
Knows he shouldn't
' Holding his breath, Joe edges in
It's ravaged, torn to pieces
The floor safe is open, about half the gold bars missing
But the apartment seems empty
Exhaling, Joe works quickly
Knocks a tile aside, pulls a wad of cash from the wall
heavy jacket from the closet
Eyes dart around the room - what else
But too late -- footsteps in the hallway
Joe ducks into the bathroom just as Kid Blue and a    enter the apartment
' Joe crouches
Outside, Kid Blue piles the man's arms full of gold bars
(
) That's twenty four there
'm keeping count
(
) Uh huh
(
) Two more trips should do it
Joe gently lifts himself off his haunches
28
' The Tall Gat Man exits, Kid Blue stays crouched over the floor safe hefting out bars, his back to the bathroom
In the distance, a
Kid Blue's head perks up
From the bathroom
Quick as lightning, the Kid draws his gat and spins - but Joe is already upon him, full sprint
Joe tackles the Kid backwards
But while Joe uses his momentum to leap over the   , the Kid tumbles back into it, vanishing inside with a painful thud
Joe scrambles to a stop, lifts the heavy safe trap door and it down - just as the Kid's hand grasps the open edge
With a sickening , the trap door closes on the Kid's fingers
bellowing howl, his fingers withdraw, and the safe door clicks shut
The   rigged to the code pad to crack it clatters off, and whirrrr,
Locked
Joe, panting, goes on hands and knees to the safe door and shouts clear and earnest: Kid listen Kid
'm sorry
Tell Abe 'm going to fix this
Tell him keep my bars safe cause  swear to god 'm going to fix this, 'm going to find my loop and 'm gonna kill him
Tell Abe- The wood paneled floor above the safe door splinters upwards with gunshots, and a chunk of Joe's right ear explodes
More blood than you'd think spills down his neck, Joe falls back
Three more shots -
And now footsteps running down the hall
Joe on his feet, slipping in his own blood, sprints across the apartment
The    appears in the doorway, shooting blindly at Joe, chunks of wall and plaster exploding as Joe doesn't stop but
'   - 5 floors up, Joe leaps out, hits the fire escape, bullets shattering the window
Blind with blood, ears ringing, Joe barrels down the fire escape
confused blur of iron steps, slipping and scrambling down, but now the tall gat man is out the window and shooting down at him
Somehow Joe slips and rolls, grabs at thin air, falling - three stories at least, falling
When he hits the ground the world goes away
29
- We abruptly   to a very familiar scene
Young Joe stands alone in the corn field, in his stance, ready to draw
But nothing happens
Silence
Joe checks his watch, confused
2:30 and change
This is exactly the scene where Old Joe appears, being replayed before our eyes
But when Old Joe does , it's different: his hands are tied, his head covered with a sack
And something very different happens: Joe raises his gun and without hesitation
Old Joe's chest explodes
He falls dead
Joe approaches the body, and slows
Sensing something
He pulls off the sack
The face of his older self
Old Joe
He flips him over
Gold bars  beneath a bloody jacket
Joe has closed his loop
- The other  buy Joe drinks and cheer him, celebrating
'  - His belongings in boxes
Joe unloads the   from the trap door
- Out at sea
Joe, bundled against the cold, leans on a railing, eagerly watching the horizon
- Joe smoking in window of an empty apartment, half unpacked
- Joe walking the city streets, breathing deep
Alive
- Joe picks up a bottle of beer
Several   in suits shake down the  of the shop for money from the register
One holds a gun in the owner's face
Joe ignores them, walks out
30
- Loud and dark
Joe shotguns eye drops right out in the open, dances like a madman
- Joe's apartment, unpacked and lived in
Joe smokes
In a  behind a wall panel - stacks of
- Cloudy and cold
Joe wanders alone
Buffeted by strangers
- Music pumping, Joe deadened at a table, in another world
Beside him a   makes a glass float using his power, then shatters the glass
Red liquid goes everywhere
- Joe takes money from the stacks in the nook, which have grown drastically low
- sets a hypo down in the ashtray
- in the face of the shop's
Held by Joe
Several years older now, in his mid thirties
Dressed in a suit, surrounded by fellow
Now part of their gang
- shoot-out between rival gangs
Joe's guns blaze
remorseless killer
Blasting away, cold and skillful
Smashing up shops that won't pay protection
He's muscle
dingy dark hallway
Distant thumping bass indicates it's maybe behind a club
The hall is lined with French Gangster, all similarly dressed
Reminiscent of the Gat Men
It takes us a moment to recognize Joe among them
In his  40s now
His face a hard weathered mask soldier
(Note - it is here we transition from the actor playing Young Joe to the one playing Old Joe
) 31
- Snow on the ground
- Old Joe high as a kite, in an all out brawl
Punched to the ground
Laughing his ass off
bar fight blossoms in slow motion all around
Old Joe looks up, sees the woman who will be his  for the first time
Long red hair (reminiscent of but  Suzie
) In a green dress
She flees the fighting, towards the exit
aSORTIE
a Transfixed and high, Old Joe follows her
Puts his hand on her shoulder
She turns, looks him over
Flips him off
Leaves
Old Joe watches her go
In love
- Old Joe hits on his future Wife, she tells him to fuck off
- Old Joe in bed with his future Wife
They kiss
- Old Joe shoots up a storefront with his gang
- Old Joe's future wife yells at him, holding his gun holsters accusingly
She throws them across the room
- He holds her in bed, both of them troubled
- Old Joe driving
Deep in thought
His future Wife beside him, her hand on his
He hits the brakes
/  - The car screeches to a halt on a beach side road
Old Joe gets out, runs across the beach to the water, pulling his gun out of its holster
He fires it out to sea till its empty, then throws the gun into the ocean
He runs back to his Wife, standing on the beach
They kiss
They fall to the sand, and kiss

- cottage in the country
- Old Joe sweats and shudders out his drug addiction
His Wife tends to him
-  - Old Joe in his mid 50s, his Wife lying on a hammock with him, reading
Hands lazily entwined
good life
-  - The Wife cuts vegetables
Headlines (in French) scroll across a small floating screen, against images of destruction
aGangland Terror Spreads, Who is The Rainmakera She turns it off
- Lazy, dust motes hanging in the sunlight through the windows
Old Joe in bed, in his late 50s
His Wife walks through, says something inconsequential, puts her hand on his foot
Draws it away, fingers sliding off gently
And is gone
We stay with Old Joe
His deep breath
The sun warming the sheets
Running water from the kitchen
His eyes focus on his hand
Written in faded ink on the palm is a number we do not recognize: 07153902935
long moment
With all the violence in the world, the cottage's green front door is
Joe runs out of the bedroom half dressed, and  grab him, taking him down with a rifle butt to the head
His Wife is dragged from the kitchen screaming
- Dark cars parked out front
We watch the quiet facade for a moment too long, violence that we don't want to think about happening inside
Then the door  open and Gangsters drag Joe out, sobbing thrashing and bleeding from his head
33
- Concrete, nondescript
The Gangsters carry Joe in, now hog tied
Put a sack over his head
Lead him towards a machine, an iron monstrosity with a hatch
One of the men taps his watch - hurry
Another man pulls a large lever, and the machine hums, warming up
Joe's face, covered with the sack
Breathing
Remembering: flashes of his , screaming
Then Joe  and somehow his hands are loose, he one man, tears off the sack,  another man, a flurry and then it's over
He stands among a pile of broken men
Slowly takes stock
Looks at the exit
Looks at the faded number on his blood-smeared hand
million things in his mind
But just one choice
The machine hums angrily
Ready
- Like an iron coffin
Old Joe climbs inside
Braces himself
Closes the hatch behind him
Flash and crack and he is sent
- And appears in front of his younger self
The scene now plays out as it did the first time
Joe hesitates, Old Joe gets the upper hand, knocks him out
Old Joe looks around, gets his bearings
Stares at his younger self a moment
Then goes to the truck
- Old Joe drives the truck into the city
- Cramped
Old Joe walks in quickly, gets aspirin, wrapped sandwiches, bandages, big bottles of water
Removes his torn jacket, dumps it
At the register, the  bags everything up
Old Joe pulls the blunderbuss on the clerk
And your jacket
34
- Wearing the clerk's jacket, Old Joe takes four aspirin
Holds his head a minute, rocking gently
'  - On the street outside the building
Old Joe approaches, watching the window high above
Weighing his options
He scans the street
Spots an   in the alleyway
Movement from behind it - Kid Blue and the Tall Gat Man loading their bars in the back
Shit
Old Joe turns to go, but  when his eye catches movement between parked cars
It's Joe
Young Joe, hid between the cars, looking up at the apartment building weighing his options
(') () Don't do it
Idiot
Don't do it
After a moment Joe dashes across the street and into the building
Old Joe stays still a moment, watching him go
Ducks into shadows as Kid Blue and the Tall Gat Man step from the alleyway, wiping their hands
Two more trips
They enter the building
Old Joe takes a breath, then casually walks down the sidewalk, past the alleyway, scoping the Armored Van in the driver's seat
The Gat Man Driver watches Old Joe disappear from view
Suspicious, he uncovers a  on the seat beside him
When he looks back up Old Joe stands in his headlights, blunderbuss raised
The windshield shatters, the Gat Man Driver is torn apart
Old Joe runs up, flings open the door, digs through the bloody mess frantically, finding the
35
' Old Joe dashes out onto the street as gunfire cracks from the high apartment window
Sharp eyes will notice that Old Joe's right ear is now clipped off, an old wound
He dashes towards the apartment door, gun in hand, but stops when the window five stories above shatters with gunfire
Old Joe backs up, and sees Joe scrambling down the fire escape as the    fires down at him
Old Joe takes expert aim with the gat, and fires three shots upwards
The Tall Gat Man's gunfire stops
Joe slips on the fire escape, falls two stories and lands on the hood of a parked car
Old Joe goes to him, checks his pulse
Behind them the    hits the sidewalk with a
Old Joe goes to the tall gat man's remains, picks another gat out of them, and goes back to Joe's inert body on the car hood
Stupid little shit
He lifts him in his arms
- Joe wakes slowly, pained
Lying alone in an abandoned lot on the outskirts of town
Slowly he takes stock of himself
Nothing broken
tight bandage on his ear
mournful train whistle, and he turns
Through a chain link fence, the train yard
He was put here for a reason
man and a young boy in rags hop onto an empty cargo car, heading out of town
Joe watches the boy, his eyes angry
Stands shakily
And walks away from the train yard
Something like a  sweeps overhead, a spotlight zigzagging the area
Joe ducks into shadows, heading towards the city
swarm of activity, Gat Men rushing in and out
36
(-) He ain't dumb like the last, we gotta get lucky now
Cover the roads out of town
Sweep the streets, pull in his social circle, pound the pavement
' Map spread on a table
Gat men gathered around Abe
3 He'll hop a train
Fast and untraceable
Maybe
Sweep the train yard
Every second that passes is bad, go
' Kid Blue slumps in a chair, holding a rag to a wound on his head
Eyes wet from crying
Abe storms in
Stupid little shit
can't hear you Abe leans in next to his ear and shouts Well that's what happens when you fire a gat in a steel box you stupid little shit
can fix this
can find him
Go home and let the grown ups work
Kid Blue
- More helicopters sweep the streets, searchlights blazing
Cars with Gat Men circle slowly, shining spotlights themselves
Joe leaps from the shadows, ducks behind a dumpster
Barely avoiding the light
He won't last long out here
Where would  go if  were me
37
He sprints into an alleyway, but Gat Men are coming down the other side with flashlights
Goes back the way he came, turns a corner
' Joe finds himself in front of a familiar
Seth's apartment
Three stories up, Seth's darkened window
He looks up at it, hesitant but desperate
- window shatters inward, punched through by a wrapped fist
big reading hall, empty and dark
The broken window opens, Old Joe slides in
Weaves his way past the reading tables, finds what he's looking for at a desk
suspended sheet of thin plastic turns out to be a computer
Checking his hand, he inputs the number
Navigates menus and windows, information flashing, searching
- Gat Men in cars and helicopters patrol the streets
Kid Blue sits on the curb, smoking a cigarette
Seething at his bandaged hand
Deep in thought
His eyes lift
An idea
'  - The familiar red garage
And three stories up, Seth's lit window
Kid Blue pulls a small caliber gun from a holster concealed on his boot, enters the building
- Old Joe finishes printing several large documents that look like maps
He folds them up, pockets them
Dashes to the window, starts to heft himself up - And stops
On his hand, a smooth aged scar
Of an arrow
Pointing to his wrist
Old Joe's breath catches
He pulls down his sleeve, revealing aBa then aEa Then aA then aTa
He bares his arm, reading the entire message
38
'  - The peephole screen on the inside of Seth's apartment door
Kid Blue manipulating a device, a shower of sparks blows the screen out momentarily, and the door swings open
Kid Blue storms in, his gun drawn, sweeping through the apartment with over-eager purpose
Empty
He deflates
Thinks
Goes to the peephole screen, touches it and a menu comes up
little manipulating, and the image is rewinding
An empty hall, scanning back half an hour
Then: young Joe
Kid Blue stops scanning, hits a '
Joe feels around the door jam, retrieves a key, and enters the apartment
Kid Blue exhales
Well Joe was here
Taps the screen again, it goes back to a live feed, and he's about to step away when his eye catches something
He pushes a square on the screen, and the view changes
To a live feed from a camera in the ceiling of the apartment
Excited, Kid rewinds this half an hour
On the screen: Joe enters the apartment
Rifles around a little, then sits at the table
Head in his hands
Staring into space
Then goes to a kitchen drawer, opens it, gets something
Goes to the front door, takes something off the wall, briskly exits
Kid Blue stops the screen
He goes and sits where Joe sat
Stares where Joe stared
The kitchen counter
blender, sink
Can labeled aCOFFEE
a Kid goes to the kitchen drawer Joe opened, pulls it open
It's full of knives
Kid goes finally to the door, looks at the wall
small rack for keys, several hanging and one empty hook
Kid Blue stares into space, trying to put these pieces together
Lights a cigarette
-  - The sun rises over a flat endless field of corn stalks
39
We push forward through the green stalks at a brisk pace
They part before us, endless, hypnotic
-  - The same from the previous flashback
Old Joe in bed, half asleep
woman's arm under his neck
It slips away, and he kisses its wrist
Comfort, warmth
The woman, leaving
Her hand touches and slides off his foot, moving away
- Old Joe emerges from the corn fields bordering the sidecar roadside diner
Fumbles in his jacket, dry-swallows four aspirin
Regains his footing
Walks around the diner cautiously
Parked in back behind a dumpster, '
Joe sits at a booth
Old Joe enters, steps up slowly, sits
moment of silence
Along with his ear, Joe's hand and arm are now wrapped in bloodied bandages
Joe's eyes go to Old Joe's arm
Old Joe pulls his sleeve back and shows him the scar spelling aBEATRIX
a Beatrix the waitress steps up breezily
Coffee
Please
Black
And water
Anything else
( ) Are we eating
ordered something
Steak and eggs, rare and scrambled
Two steak & eggs coming up
40
She goes
Another pause
We're not going to talk about time travel
ok
Must hurt
His arm
Yeah
Didn't know if you'd put it together
Clever
() Do  get the scar when you're cut, or when the knife is on its way down and it's inevitable that you're going to be cut
'm not cutting myself again to- 'm not asking you to
It's an interesting question, 've just lost a lot of blood today
You know there's another girl here on weekends
() Sue
Well
Have fun explaining who a Beatrix' is for the next thirty years
Beatrix sets Old Joe's black coffee next to Joe's white
(') How's the French coming
Good
41
(fast in French, ) know you have a gun between your legs
Joe's face registers obvious incomprehension
(') No
Well you'll get there eventually
Obviously
don't care what you're here for, whatever you think you're going to get from me
More time or whatever you want
can't let you walk away from this diner alive
Because the next 30 years of my - 'm sorry to cut off - sorry -are mine they're not yours to cut off this spiel you've they're not yours anymore you been practicing all night, can say anything you want but but  need you to need you to you're not walking outta here listen
Listen
alive You know what the voice of god sounds like
See now good you're confused now but you're listening
hope the voice of god sounds like an old man speaking French
Old men speaking French sound like primeval trees in a strong wind, just irrefutable
Wise, strong, gentle, all these things in harmony, complimentary
At once
Old men speaking French
Young men speaking French sound, without exception, like weenies
Fact
You ever hear a Frenchman under 40 try to sound threatening
It's hilarious
English is a tight t- shirt, flatters the young
Rat a tat tat
French is a double breasted suit
Young man can put it on, but it always feels like he's putting something on
Some things, you just need the years
It's my favorite language
've got a life ahead of me that's mine and 'm not giving it up for you or anybody 42
Well you know what you have to do then why don't you take your little gun out from between your knees and do it
One in the head, two in the heart
Boy
It's all aanybodya and anevera and then you show up here and think you can talk me into dying
Well bullshit we both know you're not going to kill me
Christ you ordered eggs
Old Joe downs two aspirin
Takes a breath
(') know why you couldn't pull that trigger
When you're tasked to do the unthinkable, your mind, it'll do anything it can to stop you
Only way is you gotta know why you're doing it, in your bones, so you can say it out loud to someone without apologizing
Or you gotta cut yourself off, go numb
But that'll kill you, down the line
() It's hard to make eye contact with you
It's too strange
Your face looks backwards
Yeah, that helps actually
That little twist of unfamiliar
() You're not winning some pissing contest by looking me in the eye, you didn't know what  looked like until yesterday, it makes sense that it's easier for you
wasn't trying to
Do you know what's going to happen
Have you already done all this, right now, as me
No not - exactly -  don't want to talk about time travel shit, because we'll start talking about it and then we'll be here all day making diagrams with straws
It doesn't matter
43
When  hurt myself now, it changes your body
Do my actions change your memories
It doesn't matter because  don't know how it works
Nobody knows how it works
Time travel was an accident, thirty years from now the smartest men in the world know exactly one thing about it that you don't: they know to be scared to death of it
() My memory is cloudy, there's a cloud
It's a, it starts clear then gets cloudy as it goes back
Goddammit hand me those
Straws
Joe passes him two
(') And the salt
No, the pepper
The pepper
Old Joe sets two straws about a foot apart, parallel, and pours pepper between them, thus: (') Ok, the span between the straws is a timeline of the next 30 years
(the left straw) is the present moment, right now
(the right straw) is the moment thirty years from now when  was sent back
The machine is tuned to a fixed time, you know that, 30 some years, it's not adjustable
What's the pepper
44
The pepper is a sort of fog
See my memories start clear here, (at the right straw) but as they go back they get cloudier, until they're totally obscured
It's like a fog
Because my memories aren't really memories, they're one possible eventuality now, and they grow clearer or cloudier as they become more or less likely
But then they get to the present moment (the left straw) And they're instantly clear again
Like a wall of fog moving forward with the present moment
can remember what you do after you do it
He pushes the left straw slowly towards the right, and it pushes the pepper with it
So you can And it hurts
So when we're apart you can remember what  do
After  do it
Uh huh
But Beatrix brings their food, two identical plates
Old Joe awkwardly clears away the pepper and straws
(') This is a precise description of a fuzzy mechanism
Time travel fucks everything, my brain and body try to catch up
It's messy
That's why it's dangerous
And it hurts
All  know  know two things for sure
know what's happening in my head
And  know that you're still going to meet her
Who
Old Joe takes a worn double of Joe's   from his pocket, clicks it open
We don't see inside it, but he stares at it intently
45
(') This is a woman, what
'm going to fall in love with
She's gonna save your life
Old Joe makes eye contact with Joe, for maybe the first time, and holds it
Unexpectedly naked on his face is the deepest sort of grief
Deep and unrelenting
Joe can't look at it, he breaks off his gaze
The grief is too much for Old Joe to swallow back down, so he turns it into anger
(') For a long time at the beginning she thought we'd have a baby
She would have been a good mother
She wanted that so much
And now 'm saying sorry to a picture
She's
How is she, you said save my life
Your life
Let's look
At your life
You're a killer and a junkie
And a fucking child mentality, aMy life,a awhat's mine
a Save your life, you're asking how
The question is why
Why would someone waste themselves on you, give up the good life they had, sacrifice a good life to love you
My life is my own,  don't need it Shut your fucking child mouth
She's going to clean you up and you're going to take her love like a sponge and you're both going to pretend that she's saved you, you're so self absorbed and stupid
() Yesterday
Thirty years from now is yesterday
And  can remember it, it's going to happen
Let me tell you what's going to happen to this woman who saved your worthless life
- Kicked in with all the violence in the world
46
-  () His Wife spins, as Gangsters burst into the entryway
Old Joe in bed
It plays out again
He leaps to his feet, is tackled by the Gangsters
They drag Old Joe from the bedroom
Though the hall, Joe sees the woman struggling against two Gangsters, her dress torn and bloody
One approaches her with the knife
Old Joe screams, struggles, but cannot stop them from doing what they do to her
Joe is not sure where to put his eyes
Have you heard of the Rainmaker
Seth said, that night
new boss in the future, he said
The Rainmaker came out of nowhere and in the span of six months took total control of the five major syndicates
That would take an army
But he didn't have an army
Legend is he did it alone
Alone alone
Don't know  believe the legend but he didn't have an army
How did he do it
That's the question
And no one knows
Not only that, there's no pictures of him
It's insane
There's stories he has a synthetic jaw
Things like that
But word spread quick about him through the ex-looper grapevine, even before his mass executions and vagrant purges and reign of terror, because the first thing he did was start closing loops
All of them
Exterminating the whole program
Cleaning house
47
Old Joe pulls the folded papers he printed at the library out of his jacket, puts them on the table
(') Do you know what this is
This number
This number
On the back of his papers he scrawls the number: 07153902935
As he writes it, a phone starts ringing, bringing us into: -  - An 8th story office, under siege
Gangsters down in the street fire up at the windows with guns
Helicopters pass by
The office door is blocked shut with a filing cabinet
On the phone - the looper , but in his mid 50s
Battered and terrified
Holding a piece of paper, reading off it, on the phone with Old Joe
The wall with the door in it  inward
-  - The line goes dead
Old Joe hangs up
Looks at his hand, with the number
Standing in his cottage, before he was sent back
Through the window, his wife working in the garden
Old Joe closes his hand
(
) This is a piece of identifying information on the Rainmaker can use it to find him, now, and stop him from killing my wife
Old Joe showing the number to Joe
None of this concerns me
We're done we're gonna walk outside now
This is going to happen It happened to you, it doesn't have to happen to me
(points: the pocket watch) You got her picture in there
Show it to me
Show me her picture
And when  see her for the first time 'll walk away, and she won't be with me
() 48
(') guarantee the instant  look at her picture that fog in your brain will swallow up the memories of her and she'll be gone
Gone
She'll be safe
And then we can all do what we have to do
beat
Old Joe holding the pocket watch, gazing at it
Then he snaps it closed in his fist, drawing it back
No you don't understand
We don't have to give her up
'm going to tell you why 'm here now
He puts his hand on the folded papers
(') 'm gonna save her
quick beat
Joe goes for his gun
But Old Joe is fast, he jams his foot into Joe's crotch, crushing the hidden gun into him
Joe cries out, Old Joe grabs his hair and plants his face into the table
When Joe's hands go to his face Old Joe grabs them and pulls
Foot in his crotch, pulling his arms tight over the table
(') The Rainmaker is alive right now
Living here, somewhere in this county
And  can find him with this
need you to lay low, stay out of my way and not get caught
know how to fix this,  won't stop till  finish it
'm going to find him and kill him
Joe's face loosens, his eyes on their coffee cups
It's been awhile since we've gotten a warm-up
Old Joe realizes, looks around
The diner is eerily quiet
Beatrix and the staff have all quietly left
Fled
Old Joe swings out of the booth, still holding Joe by the hair, dragging him like a doll
Joe's blunderbuss clatters to the ground
Old Joe drags him to the window
They look out
Nothing in the parking lot
Too quiet
49
It's been thirty years for me, so it's hard to remember
When you stole Seth's bike you stripped out the security tracker
Right
Joe's fearful face says a no
' Old Joe draws his gat
(') Make it to the field, you can lose them in the field
Go east and hop Joe punches Old Joe square in the jaw, and he goes down
His papers and gun fall
The diner door
've got him
He's here
barrels in, his gat blazing
Joe scrambles but Old Joe gets the gat
With an expert shot Old Joe puts the Gat Man down, but there are two more behind him
Pinned behind a booth, Old Joe returns fire, glass breaking and chaos
Joe grabs at the papers, Old Joe grabs them first and yanks
Leaving Joe with a torn-off top sheet
Joe scrambles away, down the length of the diner behind the booths, back to their table, as the Gat Men and Old Joe have their fire fight
Joe's blunderbuss on the ground beneath the table
He scoops it up
Turns, and fires at Old Joe
Shit
Joe's blunderbuss hacks another shot, and the window behind Old Joe explodes
Old Joe makes his break, sprints for the broken window, jumps
- and hits the dusty parking lot running
Towards the corn
Kid Blue squats on his haunches with four more Gat Men, their guns trained on the diner door
Three Gat Men burst out, followed by Joe
The back, he's running
Around back
50
They all run around back, where Old Joe is halfway to the corn but not there yet
The seven Gat Men and Kid Blue and Joe fire their guns after him while running but they're too far away (and they're running) so nothing hits
Joe blasts at the old man blindly, sprinting with all his might, eyes streaming tears in the dust
When Old Joe hits the wall of corn he seems to vanish
Four of the Gat Men follow him in, while the remaining pursuers slow to a stop, doubled over, panting
Defeated
It takes a few seconds for Kid Blue to realize that Joe is there with them
It takes another second for Joe to realize that the dynamic has changed
He turns and runs back towards the diner, Kid Blue and the Gat men in pursuit
One of the Gat Men fires
Alive
No, alive
Joe makes it to the Slat Bike, jumps on, hits the ignition
No fuck no fucking piece of shit The Kid and the Gats closing in, and just the moment that Kid Blue lays his hands on the back of the bike the engine turns over with a
The back of the bike kicks up, heat and air blasts from the open slats beneath, blowing Kid Blue back on his ass
The bike  a few feet off the ground
Joe roars off into the corn
The Kid is on his feet running back to the Gat Men
The tracker
Get the tracker
Joe riding at full speed through the thick corn stalks
He , snapping through corn stalks and rolling to a painful stop
The bike  onward through the stalks, quickly out of sight
Pained, Joe lies still, breathing hard
Pulls Old Joe's torn paper from his pocket
On one side, the number Old Joe scribbled: 1027363259 He flips it over
It's a map
Mostly of empty farm land, bisected by a bold highway and scattered farm houses
One of them is
51
- bare field of churned chocolatey earth
Near its edge juts the dead stump of an old tree
in work clothes named  chops away at the trunk with a large axe
Over and over, splintering it apart
Endless plains of corn surround the field
In the near distance, a two story farm house with an adjacent barn
Sara focused on her work as the sun rises
- Sara fiddles with a garbage can sized , and with a crackle of mechanic thrusters it floats up and over the corn fields, spraying something chemical
- Sara makes coffee
- She sits on a rocking chair, and mimes smoking an invisible cigarette
Our first good look at her face
Clear and beautiful, but it has been here for awhile
The morning light changes from steel blue to pale white
Rocking gently, fake smoking and drinking coffee
Not going anywhere
- Blinds drawn, dark
lies in bed
Sara steps in, puts her hand on the sleeping figure's foot
'mon baby
Time to get up
- Cooking eggs
The front door bangs
She looks up
The screen door bangs in the wind
Sara inspects it
The latch is broken
She sighs
Then freezes
52
Through the screen door, some fifty yards across the front lawn, the dark figure of a  stands at the edge of the corn fields
Watching her
She watches right back for a long moment
Then grabs a shotgun mounted above the door and with no hesitation at all plows outside
The dark figure vanishes into the corn fields
Sara storms down the porch and stalks across the lawn, shotgun extended
Not fucking around
Does not slow her pace until she is ten yards from the corn fields, where she plants herself and shouts: Listen up fucker
have shot and buried three vagrants in the past year
If you want to know the Christ's honest truth 'm starting to get a taste for it
So  don't care what hobo sob story you've got,  get a dozen a week and it cuts no cash with me
It's me and my husband here, we're broke and angry at our lot in this world and heavily armed
So take some corn and move on, but if you show your face again  will cut you the fuck in half
Silence
Just the wind in the corn
long beat
Then Sara turns, walks briskly back
Moments later Joe's face pokes through the corn stalks
He takes in the farm
The barn behind it
The fallow field
Joe sits in the same spot, a few feet in the corn but with a clear sight line at the house
His gun on his knee
'  - Pale, sweating
Something's wrong
He winces
Pinches his eyes
Headache
The sun pounds down
He looks at the piece of map
'mon
'mere
'mon
'mon
'mon
53
-  - Helicopters sweep by
' Abe stands fuming, flanked by two Gat Men
Kid Blue sits like a kid in detention
Well
You found him
And you russeled up a posse and went to git a em
Like a good little cowboy from one of your movie movies
Without telling me
can do it again
You can fuck up again
Really
You know what happens to me if don't get that old bastard
got too much riding, Kid,  can't afford a fuck-up playing cowboy
Put your gat on the table
Fighting tears now, Kid puts his gun on the desk
But he doesn't take his hand off it
wanted you to say  did good, that's all  wanted
This is all have
Abe puts his hand on the gat
Kids' finger still on the trigger
tense moment
Abe pulls the gun away, across the table
(') Please just give me one more chance, 'll bring him here alive and hold him and you can put a bullet in his brain yourself- Abe grabs the hammer
it on Kid's bad hand, crushing it
Kid howls, the Gat Men grab him
Kid is literally dragged up the stairs by a Gat Man
The Gat Man shoves Kid Blue through the twisty maze of backstage, past girls and Loopers and men
54
The Kid blubbers and bleeds
Humiliated
But he pulls himself halfway together
Make a show: 'm gonna make this good again will
'm gonna be back
- Raining
The Gat Man pushes the Kid out the back entrance door, into the alley
The Kid instinctively turns towards the street
But the Gat Man steers him back, deeper into the alley
The Kid realizes what this means
Everything changes
Oh no
Oh no no no no He fights in vain to break from the Gat Man's grip
Weeps, begs, clasps at whatever he can grab
The Gat Man turns a corner -- towards the alley's dead end
(') No
No
No no no no
Shrieking
Annoyed, the Gat Man throws the Kid hard to the concrete
The Gat Man pulls his gun, raises it without ceremony
The Gat Man's face explodes
Staggers, his gun into the wall
He drops like a doll
Kid Blue lies in the rain, hyperventilating
His pant leg hiked up, showing his boot with its holster
In his mangled left hand, the small caliber  he keeps stashed
His pinkie on the trigger
(') Oh
Cradling his crushed hand, dazed, he scampers off like a soaked rat
- Silent and still
Sara comes out onto the front porch
She gathers up a few things, turns out the porch light
Notices a floodlight still lit on the  across the yard
She turns the porch light back on
The dark corn fields, silent and vaguely threatening
She steps back in the house, emerging again with the shotgun
55
- Sara stalks towards the barn, shotgun in hand
Shadows loom across the yard
All is silent
- She reaches the barn
hard pool of light from a mounted floodlight falls off to inky darkness
Hits a metal switch near the barn door and the light snaps off
In its absence the darkness swarms
She briskly walks back towards the house, but slows
Stops
Turns
In the darkness by the barn, crunch crunch
Crunch
And maybe a shape
Deep in the swarming dark
Hey
Who's there
Sara levels the shotgun at the darkness, and steps back
Quiet but definite - crunch crunch
And now, definitely a shape
man
coming towards her
(') Stop right there
Stop
- Joe slumped over unconscious where we left him, in the corn
Sara's shout wakes him with a start
Sweating, pasty
Disoriented
Something is wrong with him
In a flash of panic he parts the corn stalks, sees Sarah backing away from the barn
The dark hulking figure of a man pursues her slowly but steadily
His hand goes to his holster but his gun has fallen out, he scrambles in the dirt for it
Sara backing up still, shotgun leveled
The man, still in darkness, comes towards her
You stop right there, you stop
She fires her gun in the air
The man pauses, but then continues towards her
She trips on a root,
56
2ND   - From a '  - We run across a darkened bedroom to the child's hand smacks the glass, and framed through the pane, through the unseen child's eyes, this is what we : Sara on the ground, fumbling the gun
In trouble
The , advancing towards her menacingly
At the last moment, from the corn fields,  runs into the light and steps directly between them, shouts, his gun raised at the Dark Man
And the Dark Man
- Joe's gun leveled, face set
But the porch light on the man's face: it is not Old Joe
It is a man in his 30s, filthy, with down's syndrome greasy sign around his neck: aPLEASE    $ Joe lowers his gun, face melting
Jee sus
(to the  ) Hey, hey
'm going to get you - But the man scampers off, leaving his sign
(') great
The child, in darkness, watching
He recedes into the bedroom, his hand slipping off the glass
Sara stands, picks up the sign, calls after the
Hey you forgot your greasy goddamn hobo sign oh for godssakes
(turns to Joe) Alright, what are you
Joe turns away from her quickly, but doubles over, crumpling to a heap on the grass
Sara checks his face
57
(') Hey
Look at - hey
The fuck- ehh
Joe
She steps away
Takes a moment
Breathes
- She drags Joe up onto the porch, under the light
Hey
Up here, at the light
Hey
Sara
Hard
His eyes snap open
He sees her face
She feels his head
Checks his eyes
Cherry red and veined, swollen under the lids
( ) My head
splitting apart
time eventualities, he said- How long since you dropped
Sara mimes an eye dropper
Dropped, or what the kids call it
day
One day
Wow
She leans back on her haunches, looks at him, deep in thought
Deciding what to do
Joe lies prone, shaking, sweating
Thirsty
can't feel my legs You're withdrawing from a synthetic barbiturate
It's a quick punch but it's this bad a day in, without care you might not make it through the night
Sara looks at his shoes
Beneath the caked mud, fine leather
Her eyes linger on his gun
They turn cold
58
She stands quickly without a word, vanishing into the house
Joe lies still, breath shallow
Turns his head, hazy
Thirsty
Thirsty
Soft footsteps approach
Small bare feet padding towards him through the front door
young boy steps out onto the porch, 6 years old, named
Cid looks Joe over
His eyes linger on Joe's gun
Then he kneels, his small hands feeling Joe's sweaty face
Pushes a straw to Joe's lips
Joe's hands clasp around a plastic cup with a cartoon tiger, and he drinks
(
) () Cid
'mere monkey
Cid goes back into the house, leaving his cup with Joe
- Sara tries to pick Cid up but he dodges, walks up the stairs
Who's that man
Just a vagrant babe
Sara leads him down the hall and into his bedroom
No he's not
Oh yeah
His shoes are too shiny
Well aren't you a smart monkey
' He gets in bed
Is he sick
Yup
59
Will he get better
Yup
Promise
Go to sleep
Okay
Night baby boy
Kisses him
Night Sara
Lingers over him in the pale light
Then goes
- darkened highway, the lights of the farm house distant small    rumbles up, stops on the soft shoulder
Sara at the wheel
Sits a second
Then climbs out
Roughly pulls Joe out of the flatbed
He lands in the dirt
Sara avoids looking at him, closes up the flatbed
Joe weakly grabs her ankle
She pries his hand off, and discovers '  in the dirt beside him
Takes it angrily, strides back to the truck
- Sara gets in, drops Cid's cup on the seat beside her
Looks in her rear view mirror
Leaving a man to die
Looks down at Cid's cup
For a long moment
Ssssshhit
- Sara lights a gas lamp
Threads a hose from a tank of water around the cot
Joe on a metal cot, covered with blankets
Water
Drink it, all night, more than you think you want
Moves a metal bucket next to the bed
Adjusts the blankets
(') Aim for the bucket
And don't chew your tongue off
In the morning we're gonna talk
60
The last thing she does is handcuff his wrist to the cot and take his gun
On her way out she puts it on a bench beside the door, and turns out the floodlight
- Dawn breaks
Exhausted Gat Men dutifully patrol the streets with flashlights, stopping every passerby
On the outskirts of the city
Vagrant fires burn distant orange
large drainage pipe drips into a brackish creek
Underground
We move through it
Cavernous space beneath a high street grating, damp and cold
Old Joe sits on the ground, methodically cleaning and loading his gun
He finishes
Places the gun on top of his folded, torn maps
Closes his eyes
Sees: -  (  ) bank of fog clears, revealing Sara's face looking down at us
She slaps us hard
Hey
Old Joe touches his temple
Head aching
Remembering
The first time  saw her face
-  (  ) Sara's face
Hey
No
No no
His   sits open in front of him
He picks it up
-  (  ) Sara's face
61
Old Joe holds his pocket watch tight like a talisman
Fingers dug deep in his head
No
The first time  saw her face
- fist comes straight at us
We reel back, revealing: the Paris club, crowded and rowdy
piece of Old Joe's life that we've seen before
Joe (mid 40s) lies on the ground, lip bloodied, laughing hysterically at a   who has just hit him
bar fight blossoms in slow motion all around
Joe looks up, sees the woman who will be his Wife for the first time
In her green dress
Whisps of fog drift into frame
Inside Old Joe's pocket watch, a picture
Of his
The sun breaks in through the grate above
Old Joe closes the pocket watch, holds in tight
Then he stands and picks up the gun and goes
: child stands in a massive doorway with blinding white light beaming through
'  - wrecked, but his eyes flutter
Blink
- Joe lies on the cot
Blinks
The barn doors, the morning sun rising through
If the child was there, he's gone now
- Cid draws at the kitchen table
Sara enters
Morning monkey
The man's up
Sara stiffens, looks out the window
(') Is he staying here now
62
No
Fingers part the green, and Old Joe peers through the dense foliage
- Old Joe hides in the trees across the street from a suburban track home
young boy in a bright jacket runs out the front door and off down the street
Old Joe checks the folded map in his trembling hands
On it, this house is circled in black, exactly like Sara's farm
Stuffing the map in his pocket, he pushes out through the trees
- Sara approaches the barn, her shotgun in hand
Joe sits on the ground just outside the open barn door, the metal cot behind him still handcuffed to his wrist
Methodically cleaning and loading his gun
Toss it
Joe freezes
Then, half annoyed just finished cleaning - alright
Tosses it into the dirt
Sara lowers the shotgun slightly
How do you feel
'm at thirty percent
Take it slow and by the end of the week you'll be at fifty
Good
She tosses him a key, he unlocks his handcuff
(') took you in so you wouldn't die, and now you're not going to die
() 63
(') So take the morning to rest, then you need to get off my farm
can't do that
'm sorry
need to stay here for a little while longer
am not cool with that
Well 'm sorry
Well 'm sorry too, you just lost your take the morning to rest privileges, get off my farm
No
Sara raises the shotgun
Get off my farm
No
You couldn't scare a retarded hobo with that thing
Literally
This is a Remington 870, one blast could cut you the fuck in half
And that's, that's telling
You're holding a gun
say 'm not afraid, so you describe the gun to me
But it's not the gun 'm not afraid of
() What are you gonna shoot in the air
Blow a hole in your barn
To scare me
Go ahead
But you couldn't let me die, you won't kill me
So now  saved your life that makes me weak
64
Look 'm not a threat to you or your boy
need to be on your property but 'd prefer to not have any contact with you at all, 'll stay in the fields
There's just one thing you need to do for me, and you won't have to deal with me again
He takes the map from his pocket, unfolds it
Tosses it over to her
(') Just, verify for me that's your house on the map
So  know 'm in the right place
What is this
map
That's my house
Why is it marked
Doesn't matter
Ok
'll be out of the barn in an hour, if you can spare it 'll take the water jug with me
Does that well have water
'll fill it from there
Sara turns the map over
Sees the  that Old Joe wrote on the back
07153902935
And everything changes
What is this
She shows him the number
She is not asking what the number is - she knows
Joe is suddenly not so relaxed
(') What is this
Does that mean something to you
For the first time in their conversation, Joe looks in her eyes
Sara stares daggers, searching
Very different than she was ten seconds ago
Joe scoots back 65
(') - And without hesitating Sara hefts the shotgun and
Rips his shirt open bloody, blows him back screaming
Old Joe  in his tracks, children running around him
His hand goes to his temple
-  (  ) Fog clears from Sara blasting us with her shotgun
Old Joe's hand runs from his temple to his neck
Feels a new but old scar, just a little divot behind his ear
Sara drags Joe in by the foot
She heaves the barn door closed
In the lamp lit dark Joe rolls and groans in the dirt
Who are you
She shoves the shotgun barrel in his face, a rush of fury (') You're right 'm not a killer but am fine with how a blast of rock salt to your face won't kill you
Who are you and what are you here for
Who are you
Joe breathes hard, bleeding in the dirt with a shotgun in his nose
But he forces calm
beat
Then he starts talking
Time travel hasn't been invented yet
But in thirty years it will be
- suburban park
On its far end, a birthday party
The   in the bright jacket we saw run out of the house earlier sits alone under a tree
Old Joe approaches him
66
Hi
Daniel, right
'm Chad's father
Aren't you going to come over
We're doing cake
It's ice cream cake and  can't eat ice cream
Cause of the milk
Well you should join the party even if you don't have cake
You have a birthday coming up
In July
We were gonna go to the lake but  don't think we are now
'm sorry
Old Joe leaves, walks across the grass
Having trouble breathing
Sara sits
Joe weakly talks, the end of a long explanation
can't go back to the city and find him cause Abe, the boss, all his men are going to search the streets 24/7 till they turn up me or
him
All  have is this map
And that he's coming here
Sara stands
Paces away
Deep in thought
Looper
Yeah
Did you know about Loopers, what we do 've heard stories
So he's coming here to murder me and my son because he thinks we might be this Rainmaker
And once he kills the Rainmaker, what happens
think
he thinks, the instant the rainmaker dies, he'll never have been sent back, so he'll just vanish, and be back with his wife
67
The same track home Old Joe studied from the trees earlier
Daniel trots towards it, coming home from the birthday party
Who is he
The guy you let run
Just some random guy from the future
Yeah
Someone
You know what these numbers mean
- Well tended by someone who loves growing things
Laurels, ivy on trellises, flowers and trees
Daniel comes through the side gate
Lifts the back door matt, revealing a dusty key
Sara takes a pen from a workbench
Shows Joe the numbers: 07153902935 She draws lines with the pen, thus: 07/15/39[02935] This is my son Cid's birthday
And this is the hospital he was born in
Joe's face, taking this in
Old Joe
Sitting in a corner of the yard
Face set hard
Daniel stands, key in hand
Drops the matt
Slow motion
Turns
Sees Old Joe, standing now
Stillness between them
'
Struggling to be stone, and then it is
He draws his gun in one fluid motion and
We don't hear the shot
We just hear the garden, the wind through the plants
68
And we just see Old Joe's face
Struggling now to remain stone
Numb he puts his gun away and exits
Old Joe walks across the park
Map in his hand
Children play in the distance
Children's voices all around
Old Joe spins, his breath up into his head
The map falls to the ground
The park around him, green and full of children
He keels over onto his knees and cries
Grabs the grass, holds it in his fingers, thick and green
- The Wife stands at the edge of a bed
35 and Full of life
Old Joe on the bed
Mid 40s
She unsnaps her   and it falls, leaving her naked in the sunlight
On the bed
Old Joe and the Wife
Faces close
Drifting into sleep
From a neighboring apartment, a
Loud and insistent
Old Joe opens his eyes, joking-annoyed at the crying baby
aGod you have to be kidding me
a Then he sees her face
Her smiling eyes, listening to the neighbor's baby cry
Like she's listening to music
She touches his hand
Old Joe
Staring at the grass
On the map beside him: three circled houses around the city
And the torn corner
Sara holds the torn piece of map in her hands
Their house circled
Would he do this
Think about what doing this would fix
What he thinks it would fix
Sara caught that, and she did not like it
69
(') He'll kill the other kids on that map and then come here last
Put off facing me
If he comes here, can you stop him
She turns the paper over in her hands
(') Given this, if  erred on the side of caution and believed all of this, 'm asking
If  trusted you
Will you stop him before he gets to my son
've lost my life
kill this man,  get it back
You can trust me
- They sit on the steps, Joe stripped to the waist
Sara picks salt chunks from his chest with tweezers and antiseptic
Joe surveys the surrounding land, cleaning his gun
We're surrounded by the corn, that leaves us blind
He can get within fifty yards of the house without a hawk spotting him
() What makes sense is, we burn the fields, level them
Sara realizes he's seriously asking
No you cannot burn down my corn fields
What kind of equipment's in the barn
Farm equipment
Nothing that shoots
No farm equipment that shoots
No
70
Joe finishes assembling his gun
Sara's eyes flick to it
(') You use what you need, set up anywhere
But one thing,  don't want you talking to Cid
watch my son, you watch the corn
That's the deal
Good by me
He hisses as she applies antiseptic to a gash in his arm
Hold still
Easy for things to get infected on a farm, start falling off
() Pussy
Caught off guard, Joe almost smiles
Then grimaces
If 'm out here and you're in the house we're gonna need some way to communicate
There's a dinner bell down by the barn, ring that if someone's coming, 'll hear it
Dinner bell
We need walkies, or buzzers
Dunno what we've got but 'll look
She spots Cid at the screen door, watching them
(') Cid
She goes to take him inside
Got any ammo for that shotgun
That isn't a seasoning
- Sara leads Cid back into the house
How's the maths coming
71
wanna help the man
Help him what
could help him with my toys
Baby
Listen
need you to stay away from that man
Okay
Let him- Cid squirms out of her grasp, bats her away with a light but angry slap
She grabs his arm harder
(') Let him do his thing, but you stay with me
Is he not good
Well we're gonna see what he is
But you stick with me
Yeah
- Old Joe's little hide-out
He violently washes his hands in a trench of water
Slumps back, eyes blood red
Streaks of tears down his face
Reddish light fading to blue through the grating high above
Runs fingers across his forehead, spreading cooling water
His eyes close
His breathing shallows
In one hand he holds his pocket watch
He places the other on the gat
The map beneath it
Daniel's map location
Two others remaining
And the missing corner, edge torn
Old Joe's face
Slipping to sleep
Then from nowhere a '  enters frame and rests on his forehead
Old Joe's eyes gasp open with terror - but it's Joe who wakes up with a start
Slumped against the steps, gun in hand
Cid's hand on his forehead
Cid steps back quickly, puts his finger to his lips
Shhh
72
- Cid leads Joe inside, beckoning him to follow
Dark
Cid leads Joe to the kitchen table
Laid out on it: an arrangement of toys
With the deliberateness of a man at work Cid clicks on a flashlight and sets it on the table
Works on several toys, cracking open cases, pulling out wires
Hands moving fast
Joe sits, watching Cid
Hand me that Phillips
Joe hands him the screwdriver
Cid keeps working
(') Tell me if you hear her coming
What are we doing here
Commundication
He pushes a button on a small plastic box in his hands, and an identical one next to Joe lights up
The way Joe looks at Cid changes slightly
(') But  need to make it stronger
How do you do that
Bigger battery
Joe idly fingers a toy
Smart
Do you kill people
Joe half laughs
Cid keeps working, his face in shadows
: Let's say  kill people
73
With your gun
Uh huh
Cid looks at him in the dark
Not scared at all
Then he goes back to fitting the backing on a toy
long beat, Joe thinking
Broken by a
They both jump - the toy truck Joe has idly played with is shrieking, sirens blaring
Joe fumbles with it, Cid reaches over and switches it off, they both freeze
And look up at the ceiling
Silence in the house
With a look of reproach beyond his years, Cid takes the truck from Joe and finishes up his work
(') How long have you and your mom been on the farm
She's not my mom
My mom got killed when  was a baby
Someone bad, bad men killed her
Cid sets the two finished  on the table
'm sorry
Sara doesn't think  remember cause was a baby
But  remember my mom
couldn't stop her getting killed
don't remember it all but  remember
was a baby couldn't do anything
couldn't stop it
Cause  was a baby
Cid is crying
Joe has never been more at a loss
'm sorry Takes the buzzers
Stands, fumbling
Retreating
74
(') You should talk to your mom about this
She's not my mom
She's a liar
With one last look back at Cid in the dark, Joe exits
: - Old Joe
Running hard
Sirens, flashlights behind him
Being chased
Zig zags through an alleyway, a pursuing car smashing up behind him
Bursts out onto the street, nearly hit by another car
Shouts all around, a few shots
Surrounding
He runs
' Gat Man briefing Abe, who hasn't gotten much sleep lately
1 -spotted him coming out of a sewer tunnel on the west end, he's on the Every fucking car, every gat, every cop - get a em down there
Flood that fucker
Take him down
- Cars, motorcycles, cop prowlers, all roar to life and blaze through the city streets in one direction
/ Kid Blue, squatting in the 10th story of a half finished highrise, looks down on the activity in the streets
Spread on the floor are maps with notes
He's been searching for Old Joe
And now his eyes are alight
He bolts for the stairs
- small park on one block
With a playground
Swings, and a merry-go-round
Gat men sweep the park
75
After they pass, Old Joe's face pops up under the merry-go- round
He crouches in a shallow space beneath it
He sees: Across from the park, a cheap
He checks his map - the 2nd circled address
Kid number two
He waits
- Sara chops the dead tree trunk in the field, greatly diminished but still formidable
Joe approaches
Can't you pull that out with a plow
Uh huh
She keeps chopping
found a, in the barn  found some parts, and  made a, thing
Joe pushes one of Cid's  into her hands, which we now see is a colorful plastic frog toy with a light bulb nose
(') If you see anything, just push that, and, Joe pushes the button on his buzzer, and Sara's lights up and vibrates
She regards the toy, then stares hard and cold at Joe
(') It's important
When
Last night
He woke me up
Don't tell him  told you though, he
Sara rolls her eyes, turns away
Starts chopping again
Joe doesn't leave
What
You said you were his mom
76
Uh huh
He told me you're not
This hits Sara hard
She resumes chopping to cover it
He said that
If he's not your son who is he
() He's my son
() had Cid when  was twenty two
But  didn't want to give up my life
In the city
The word acitya has weight for her
Implies volumes
(') So  dropped Cid with my mom, here
And my sister
And they saw how was living and they took him
My sister raised him here, she loved him
He called her mom
How'd she get killed
When Sara's eyes hit him they're daggers
(') Cid told me
You have to talk to him about it
Icy silence from Sara, and an odd stare
told you one thing,  told you to stay away from my son
He asked about my gun
You think this is going to go away if you don't talk to him about it but it's just gonna grow Stay out of it
Stay the fuck away from my son
77
She goes back to chopping
Joe lingers, then leaves
She hacks away
- Sara sits with coffee, looking out at the fields
Deep in thought
She takes a drag from her pretend cigarette
- motel style building
Gat Men in cars pass occasionally with spotlights and radios, but the activity has calmed
Old Joe slips around a corner
Staying hid
Checks the address on the map
12 Talbott Dr, #205
Makes a break for stairs leading to the 2nd level
But just at that moment a car pulls into the building's lot
Old Joe ducks under the stairs
Holding his breath
The car parks
Door slams
Footsteps
Slumping exhausted, up the stairs
And through the slatted steps Old Joe sees her face flash by
It is Suzie, the girl from Abe's brothel
Old Joe's face, pure disbelief
He recognizes her instantly
It can't be
He gingerly steps half a foot out
Looking up he can see the apartment doors above
Suzie walks down the landing
Towards apartment 205
Jesus it can't be
Then she passes it
Keeps walking
Old Joe's eyes, relieved
She stops at the next door over, knocks
It opens, vaguely indistinct conversation between her and the girl that answers
Sorry,  know  promised five, you know how it gets
Don't worry sugar
She was no problem
Gat men searched through here, lookin for god knows
Suzie disappears into the apartment
Re-emerges, holding a sleeping 6 year old girl
She whispers goodbye to the neighbor and walks back to  205
She enters
78
Old Joe, frozen
Gun in his hand
Face numbly: aYou have to be shitting me
a He climbs the stairs
On the 2nd story landing
To 205
Breath held, back against the wall
Peeks in the window
On the couch, Suzie holding her daughter
Head in her lap
Stroking her hair
Suzie's back is to us, and with her long red hair down, she is eerily reminiscent of Old Joe's wife
Old Joe watches them for a long time
- Joe sits, watching the corn
It rustles in the wind
Hand on his blunderbuss
Beside it, his frog buzzer
The tension is constant
And it's a long, long day
- Sara vacuums while Cid plays with toy trucks
- In the basement, bare concrete
Sara empties the dryer
'  - Sara sits on the floor with Cid, putting numbered tiles on a plastic multiplication table
Where does 56 go
Good
21
How long can you not sleep
don't know, awhile
That's a good question
Where's it go
Good, there
32
We should help Joe watch
Joe
Cause he can't stay awake all the time
He isn't our business
79
He's keeping us safe Baby
Let's do this now
You have 32 there,  know you know this one
want to help him
Sara is distracted by a distant bell-like
Cid
32
She goes to the window, looks out, nervous
But it's just a loose   down in the yard, whipping in the wind against its metal pole
In the distance, Joe paces the yard
Relieved, Sara returns to Cid
He sets the tile, petulant
(') No
Eight times three is what
Thirty two
Eight times three is what
Thirty two
want you to count three eights
Eight
Sixteen
Thirty two
Are you telling me you want alone time
No
Okay
Why don't you put that where it belongs
Deliberately, Cid lifts the tile and sets it straight back down on the same spot
(') Alone time
80
Then like a knife in a fist fight: He's protecting us cause you can't do it
Ok
told you to stay away from never did anything Do you think 'm stupid
So
told you already Cid is building into a temper tantrum fast
So
You do what  tell you You can't tell me what to do you're not my mom
(a deadly beat) You're not my mom
You're a liar and you're gonna get killed and you won't stop lying
Cid lunges at her, Sara slaps him back
Not hard, but Cid scoots back, eyes furious
You're a liar
Liar
hate you because you're lying
hate you
Liar
You're lying to me
Sara scoots back
You're lying
81
Cid stands, balls his fists,  at her
Sara pushes back away from him
Maybe a cloud passed over the sun
The room darkens
And we see it now, in her eyes: Sara is afraid
She bolts out of the room
Sara walks fast down the hall ' Not slowing, through her bedroom ' Into her walk-in closet, to a huge steel safe tucked in back
She opens the safe with trembling hands
And climbs inside
Closes the heavy door
Turns on a small  light
And waits
Cid's screams distant but not lessening
- Cid's screams from the house, clear as day
Joe paces in front of the barn
Turns his head back towards the house, not sure what to think
The screams stop
Joe turns uneasily back to the swaying corn
' The math game scattered, numbered tiles everywhere
Cid lies face down on the bed, cried out
Sara enters quietly
Sits on the bed beside him
Strokes his hair
He folds into her, and they're holding each other tight
- Gat Man named  strolls out of a donut shop, coffee in hand, and gets in his car
' Canady starts the car up, starts driving
82
Somehow not seeing Kid Blue crouched clear as day in the passenger side foot-well
Hey Can
Can
Canady sees him, jumps and yelps
The sedan swerves, scrapes to a stop against a parked car
Coffee everywhere
Jesus, fuckin Kid Blue what the Pull into that alley
You get the fuck outta You don't wanna be seen with me Canady, pull in the alley
Canady glares at him, but pulls the car into a narrow alley, parks it
The fuck are you still doing in town, Abe wants you dead man All Abe wants right now is the looper
Unless he got him last night
Jssshhh
No we didn't get him
Spotted and lost him
West End, near Whore's Alley
Whore's Alley
That area, Mott & Talbott, little working girl colony
(has a thought) Whore's Alley
You shoulda left town man
83
'm gonna bring him in, get right with Abe
Yeah, maybe you bring him the looper, but short of that Abe don't get right with priced men
got a price
Big one
Canady locks the car doors
And in that one moment, Kid Blue pulls Canady's gun from his holster
Holds it on him
tense moment
(') Course 'd never turn a friend for and the drivers side window explodes outward bloody
moment, then Kid Blue stumbles out, holding his ears in pain
Off down the alley and out of sight
' Sara lies with Cid, both asleep
Distant but sharp, a bell ringing
It's unmistakable this time
The
Sara's eyelids flutter
She hears
Stiffens
The bell stops suddenly
She stands, careful not to wake Cid
- Sara rushes quietly down the stairs
Through a doorway, she sees the Frog Buzzer sitting on the living room coffee table
Lit up and buzzing
She goes to the front door, throws it open
And is face to face with a tall Gat Man named
She freezes
Evenin ma'am
Evenin
How can  help you
84
Joe is nowhere in sight
You can start by accepting my apologies re the hour,  hope didn't catch you in supper
No, that's fine
Yours was the last house on my list today, been walking between empty farms all day in the hot sun
Thought 'd tick this off my list, not have to come back tomorrow
What's this about
Back in the house somewhere, a screen door bangs
You alone here, ma'am
My husband should be back from the city, any time now
Happy to hear
Could  trouble you for some water
Course
'll get some, you can take the glass with you
Actually ma'am, my business tonight, this ticking off the list business, it's gonna require me coming in
If that's alright
Jesse shifts his weight, and Sara notices his heavy boot is now a few inches over the door jam
Will you tell me what this is about
will, yes
Can  come in
Hanging above the door, just over Sara's head: the shotgun
Possibilities whirling through her mind
85
(') Ma'am
Silent decision, and she steps aside to let him enter
- Joe slips in through the screen door, gun in hand
Freezes in the kitchen, listening
(
) 'm a deputized police officer, we're looking for an escaped criminal, just doing a sweep
Seen anyone through here the past two days, vagrants
(
) No, vagrants are always passing but nobody near the house
Footsteps, as they walk deeper in the house
Joe can't tell if they're coming through the living room or hall
He hesitates
(
) This man, here
(
) He's young
No
Then at the last moment Joe slips out the hallway door, as they enter from the living room
Sara leads Jesse in, holding a photograph of Joe
She pours him some water
Jesse hands her a second photograph
We're looking for his father too, similar look and build but late 50s
May or may not be travelling together
This one is a print-out from a security camera in the Bodega, of Old Joe holding a gun on the checkout clerk
Sara's eyes linger on Old Joe's photo, side by side with Joe's
Mind spinning
Maybe making the connection, we're not sure
No
She tries to hand the photos back but Jesse doesn't take them
He notices the toys on the table
86
Keep em
Kids with your husband
Yeah
Just one
How old
Eight
Jesse pokes his head into the hallway, just missing Joe slipping through the hall and into the living room
He lifts his glass, drinks
Thank you
'll show you round the grounds, then the house, then you can be on your way
Sara holds the screen door open for him
We'll start with the house
Jesse strolls into the living room, and we follow him
He sits on a couch, taps on a small folding phone
Sara follows him
Eight, you said
Boy
And your husband
Just gotta, check in
With the home office
This goddamn thing
This man dangerous
Tween you me and a lamppost
No
Sweet kid
But he's wanted
My boss has half the city's looking for him
Half the city and me
So
And if you find him, there's a helluva price
Think on that if he comes by, acting sweet
Behind the couch, Joe crouches unseen
He looks up and sees Cid in the foyer, standing halfway down the stairs
87
If Jesse turned his head he would see Cid clear as day
Joe motions for Cid to get out
Cid points to Jesse, makes a with his hand
Asking Joe
Joe shakes his head, sharply motions: get out
Cid silently creeps down the stairs
He is in full sight of the living room, but Jesse doesn't look up from his phone
Cid vanishes down the hall
Jesse looks up, stands
(') Alright, show me upstairs
The screen door in the kitchen creaks and bangs
Jesse looks sharply at Sara
Drafts, in the house
Jesse is already moving fast to the kitchen
The instant Jesse exits, Cid appears again in the hallway
Opens a small door under the stairway and beckons Joe
(
) This door doesn't latch
(
) It used to, it's busted
Joe hesitates, then silently dashes over and in
Cid follows him in, down steep concrete stairs
Pulls the door closed behind them
It
Jesse steps out into the hallway, gun drawn
Sara behind him
Drafty house
Farm house
Jesse walks to the thin wooden door
Opens it
Closes it
He looks at Sara
What's down there
Laundry room
Door must've blown open
88
Jesse opens the door, then looks at Sara gravely
Two things
First,  have a family of my own back in the city, and want to see them again
Second if anything happens to me, and  don't report back to my boss people in fifteen minutes, they're gonna know disappeared searching this house, and inside of another fifteen you'll have an army of more me's kicking down your door
Ok
It's a laundry room
Jesse motions - her first
Bare concrete basement, starkly lit by a hanging bulb
The only things in the basement are a small washer and dryer, and a large canvas hamper the size of a fridge
No windows
Nowhere else to go
Jesse levels his gun at the hamper
You want to call out whoever's hiding in that hamper
If someone was hiding in the house, that's what 'd do
But nobody is in the house
Open it up
No  think 'm gonna put a shot through it just to be safe
He raises his gat
Sara stiffens slightly
(') You wanna call him out
Sara stays silent
long beat
Then Sara strides over, pulls the hamper open
Empty
She throws open the washer and dryer
She takes the bucket and shakes it upsidown, dumping out the water, shows him it's empty
89
Now if you promise not to wag your gun at my shoe rack 'll show you upstairs then show you the fuck out
She storms up the stairs
little cowed, Jesse holsters his gun and follows her
The water from the bucket flows in a small stream across the room, and into a drain hole under the hamper
Dark and earthy
Cid leads Joe with his flashlight
- Just outside the barn, a trap door covered with earth opens two inches
Joe and Cid prop it open, and peer out at the house
- deep large hole capped with a wooden trap door
Joe squats, Cid stands
My granddad built it, but he didn't tell anyone of us why
Nanna said cuz he was nuts
Thank you granddad
That wasn't the man
No
know him, that's what's funny
His name's Jesse
like him
He'll go away when he doesn't find me, he won't hurt her
They watch in silence for awhile
In the distance, Jesse leaves the house alone and scopes the grounds before walking back towards the highway
(') My mom gave me up
was younger than you
We were vagrants, and she was alone, for a long time thought she was stupid for getting on the drug she was on, it was bad stuff, it probably ended up killing her
() 90
(') But now  see, she was so alone
And it was what she had
She sold me
To a panhandle gang
,    -     dragged into darkness by rough men, screaming
Then we're back to the scene
(') But  got away
And  ran and ended on a train, sitting in the dark in an empty freight, going to the city, and  saw myself over and over killing those men who bought me and who got my mom on what she was on
Finding them and tearing them apart
Saving my mom
But you didn't
man in the city found me, put a gun in my hand, and gave me some things
didn't have my mom anymore
had my work, my money
My plans
For my life
That's what 'd kill for
Not something don't have, and can't ever get back
() There's just men figuring out what they'd do to keep what's theirs, what they got
That's the only kind of man there is
'm not gonna let Sara get killed
Joe looks at him
Wants to put his hand on his shoulder but doesn't
think we're clear
He opens the trap door, climbs out
Joe reaches down to help Cid out
Looking down at Cid in a hole with a trap door
Like Seth
He grabs Cid's hand and lifts him out
Sara comes out, sees Cid and her face breaks with relief
Cid runs to her, and in the distance they embrace
91
Sara and Joe share a look
Joe quickly turns his eyes back to the corn fields
- tiny, dark concrete room
Kid Blue watches a screen, his hand on a toggle wheel
security cam view of Suzie's apartment building upper landing
Playback of last night
It scans quickly forward
The   leans against the wall behind him, counting money
All working girls, yeah
Uh huh
This whole block
You wanna check those too,  can arrange
do
On the screen, Suzie comes home
Picks up her daughter from next door
Goes into 205
Kid Blue keeps scanning
And an instant later, Old Joe climbs the stairs
Kid Blue slows the playback
(') a Lo Joe
Old Joe goes up to the window, his back to the wall
Watches Suzie through the window for a long while
Kid watches him intently
Then very suddenly, without going inside, Old Joe leaves
Down the stairs, shoving his gun in his jacket
'm an arranger, stranger
Huhuha
But you don't see what you wanna see, no refunds
Old Joe vanishes down the street in a swarm of pixels
- Kid Blue emerges from a passage, into the parking lot
Looks up at Suzie's apartment door
Then down the street
few drops of rain fall
-  () Driving on a highway along the beach
few drops of rain on the windshield
Old Joe (late 40s) and his Wife in intense conversation, her hand on his
92
( ) But  will
( ) You want to,  know that
But you won't
( ) 'd do anything for you
( ) You'd do
You'd kill for me, you'd take life for me
But  don't want that
You kill for what you love, but someone loves the person you kill, and it starts again
don't want that
can't love a killer
What would you give up for me
That's yours
( ) Anything
She smiles but does not believe him
Old Joe sees this moment, in thought
/  - The car screeches to a stop, and Old Joe runs to the sea
his gun in the ocean
Above the waters, the sun breaks the clouds
Rain falls
He runs back to her
Falls on her
Kissing her
He holds her face like the most precious thing in the world
Anything
- Rain beats against stained glass
Old Joe kneeling in a pew
Fists clenched as if in prayer
He stands, stumbles out
- Oddly quiet
Old Joe walks down the sidewalk towards the side entrance to the theater
Face uncovered
In plain sight
Not caring
Stops 30 feet shy of the entrance, at a street garbage can
He draws his gun and leans over to drop it into the can
He lets it dangle from his fingers above the trash can
His pocket watch, hanging open from its chain
The picture of his Wife inside
Spinning
His gun slowly slipping from his grasp
93
With each spin of the watch, the photo of his Wife appears cloudier
Blurred
Indistinct
Gun on the tips of his fingers, about to fall
Then the photo is nearly gone
'
-  () Old Joe staggering to his feet from a fight
We've seen this before, it's the   to the previous flashback
But when he sees his Wife for the first time, whisps of grow, blotting out the scene
Deep in the fog are other backgrounds - a street, a house - and unfamiliar faces
Other eventualities, clouding this one as it becomes less likely Old Joe will meet his wife and have this memory
Erasing it
'
-  () Old Joe in bed with his wife
Baby crying outside
Her face
Then, whisps of  thickens, obscuring them
'
-  () The thrown gun splashes in the sea, and Old Joe turns back to the beach
But where his Wife was in the previous memory, now there is the
wall of it, massive, reaching to the sky
Old Joe dwarfed against it
Caught between the roiling waves and this wall of nothingness falling towards him
'
The gun on his fingertips
About to fall
moment of decision
'  - Sara lies in bed
Eyes wide open
Still and quiet in the dark
Her hand moves over her bare leg
Slides across the sheets
Finds the Frog Buzzer lying next to her
moment of hesitation
Then she pushes it
Silence
Her eyes go to the window
long beat
Then sound: a door opening in the house below
94
Quick footsteps approaching
Her eyes follow them
The door flies open
Joe, gun in hand, buzzer in the other
His eyes adjust to the dark
What
Closes the door, kisses him
The adrenaline in his head doesn't know where to go
Don't wake Cid
She pulls him to the bed, lifting his shirt off
The rain starts to fall against the windows
Lying beside each other
Joe still stunned
Sara smokes a real cigarette, taking a deep joyful drag
She sets the lighter on her palm
It floats about a foot in the air, spinning, then drops
That's pretty good
In the city, young guys would hit on me by floating fucking quarters, wouldn't tell a em  was  but 'd keep their quarters down
One guy busted a blood vessel in his eye trying to get it up
() He's you
Your loop
You lied to me
She doesn't seem angry but deeply curious
Joe sits up
(') But you protected Cid
And  know you're not lying that you're gonna kill this guy, your own self
Even though he's protecting your future
He's protecting his future
Not mine
beat
When  came back, after my sister died
Cid was sitting on the porch,  remember seeing him for the first time, in two years
() 95
(') Saw him on the porch
drove up crying and  had been at a party in the city when  got the call,  was wearing this ridiculous party dress
All my ridiculous shit don't know if he remembered me, but he looked at me
abandoned him
abandoned my baby
() Maybe  can't be a mother to him, is that something  can't get back
When he looked at me then, on the porch, he was mine again, he was my son
seen so many men in the city, who  look in their eyes and they're lost
Whether he loves me back or not 'm gonna love my son said
And he's never gonna get lost
Joe sitting up still, Sara lying beside him, maybe crying
He touches her hair
205 - - kicked open with all the violence in the world
Old Joe sweeps into the small apartment, gun drawn
Suzie cooking in a robe, opens her mouth to scream
Don't
Don't wake up your daughter
Old Joe trains the gun on her
She goes silent
(') Sit down
At the kitchen table
Quivering, she does
He keeps the gun on her
(') Do you know me
No
don't know you
Who are you
need to tell you why 'm doing this
gotta say it out loud to someone so  know
Why you're doing what
96
'  - Joe sleeping alone in the bed
Sara's voice, distant
(
) Joe
Joe
He wakes
She is calling him from downstairs
Joe comes down the stairs half dressed
Jesse holds Sara at gunpoint in the living room
Staring at Joe with a cool lack of malice
Lo' Joe
Jesse
205 threw my gun away once
To get her love
And  was going to do it again, now
Because  know she'd want me to
was going to do it
And  saw then,  saw her vanishing, like how life probably goes when you die
That's what she was asking me to give up this time
who are you
And if  picked up the gun
If made this sacrifice
Life, my life
Absolution
Given back to me
My love
Given back, just like we were, and she wouldn't know what  did to get it back
Joe steps into the living room, stands facing them
'm unarmed Jesse, you can let her go
Sara, Jesse here's the best shot with a gat 've ever seen, when he lets you go you sit on the couch and don't do anything stupid
Jesse lets Sara go and trains the gat on Joe
97
(') He's coming here Jess
My Looper, is gonna come here
gotta take you in man
got eighty large in pure gold, take my looper back in and get right with Abe, whatever he gives me back 'll split it with you
Was that your plan
Ok
It's yours, all of it Are you delusional
205 Everything set right
Everything fixed
Through this sacrifice
What are you gonna do
Old Joe stands, walks towards the back hall
Suzie screams (') No
And runs at him but he shoves her back hard
know you got no options you take the one you got but Joe, you aint gettin right with no one
Looper or no, you're beyond saving
As long as Abe's got one Gat Man standing, he'll be hunting you till his dying day
Joe's face falling
205 Old Joe, gun ready, down the darkened hallway towards the door at the end with a rainbow on it
He puts his hand on the knob
98
We're going now
We're gonna go to my truck, you're gonna Cid on the stairs, sleepy eyed
Jesse, purely on instinct, spins and draws on Cid
Cid's  - Jesse's gun, snapping like a snake, barrel leveled at him
Cid makes a strange shouting noise, falls back
Everything slows down
205 Old Joe pushes the door open
Blackness within
/ The room darkens
As if the sun passed behind a cloud
Jesse realizes it's a kid
Lowers his gun
But Cid is mid- scream, falling back, his foot misses the step and he tumbles down the stairs
Confused, terrified, falling
Joe runs into the foyer, to catch Cid
Sara runs behind him
The room is very dark now
Knick-knacks around the room rattle, then
All of them
Floating
Spinning
Sara's , on the coffee table: it into the air
205 Old Joe readies his gun, staring into the blackness
But his eyes lower
He touches his temple
Remembering
/   ( ' ) Fog clears - Joe is almost to Cid, who is still tumbling, nearly at the bottom of the stairs
/   () But just before he reaches him, Sara shoves Joe from behind
Shoving him
He's confused but her face is set
Cid hits the hardwood floor of the foyer, face contorted with rage now, hand raised to Jesse, palm outstretched
Screaming
His scream louder than it should be
99
Bigger things in the living room
Chairs
The couch
And Jesse
He rises five feet in the air, terrified
Sara pulls Joe through the front door, and he looks back and sees Jesse suspended in the air and Cid on the ground screaming like an animal, and just as they cross the threshold, Jesse explodes in a bright red fan of blood
205 Old Joe's face
Remembering
(  ) Frozen in a tableau - Cid screaming, raw power
Jesse bright red fan
Joe and Sara fall out and down the stairs
The front door and windows  in a burst of splinters and glass
205 Old Joe's eyes lift
Realizing
The Rainmaker
bare bulb hanging from the ceiling turns on
six year old girl's room
But the only person in it is Kid Blue
He shoots Old Joe with a blue tazer
Old Joe hits the ground, mouth foaming, paralyzed
Knowing the answer now, knowing the who and the how but helpless and defeated
Kid Blue kicks him in the face
100
' Gat Man circles a spot on the map in red ink, Sara's farm
1 He's there
Lost his signal five minutes ago, right after he sent word he had him
Joe
Abe slumps in a chair, taking oxygen from a tank
Call everyone, every Gat Man in the city, call a em here
Gather em all up here first
No mistakes this time
We're gonna take an army to that farm, all at once, and sweep it like hellfire
Now
- From a high vantage point
Cars, bikes, Gat Men on foot, all heading towards the club
An army, all meeting at the Belle Aurore
Massing to attack
- Moments after the blast
Joe and Sara lie in the dirt
Jesse's  parked nearby
Joe stirs first
Stands shakily
The front door jam is splintered
Windows broken
He goes inside
Sara gets up, staggers in after him
Cid
Cid
(
) Cid
Joe bursts out of the screen door, holding his Blunderbuss and wiping off Jesse's gat
Bloody Cid-sized footprints lead out the screen door and streak across the lawn, into the corn
Sara comes out after Joe, sees him heading for the corn
What are you doing with those guns
What are you going to do
She lunges for him, wild
Wrenches his arm and he spins, throwing her to the ground
101
How did your sister die
Sara holds his gaze
Then everything breaks inside her and she collapses in sobs
Heaving
(') That happened to her
Cid
() Jesus
Jesus he killed her This breaks Sara out of her sobs No
No he was climbing a bookshelf, it fell back on him
He has no control, he gets scared, it explodes
What is it a  mutation
Joe someday he'll learn to control it
Yeah  know he will
Imagine what he could do
If he did good with it
If he grew up good
He doesn't
Joe heads to the corn, Sara scampers after him but slips on the wet grass, and Joe hits the corn with a head start
You stay away from him
Cid
Cid
She runs into the corn
- as she stumbles blindly through the tall stalks
Cid
Make a noise baby, call to me
Cid
through the corn, following traces of blood on the stalks
102
(
) (') You stay away from Joe, you come to me
Cid
Tries cocking the  but it's broken
Tosses it, wields the Blunderbuss
Joe emerges from the corn
Cid crouches at one end of the small clearing
He looks at Joe
Terrified
Half covered in blood
Hair matted over one eye
Joe looks back at him
Approaches him, gun not raised, but in hand
Cid, like a frightened animal
long moment
And just like that, Joe puts his hand on Cid's head
Cid leans against his legs, crying
Sara bursts into the clearing, sees this
Runs to Cid and embraces him, wiping the blood from his face
Joe steps back
Right now two things have happened
My looper knows Cid's the kid he's looking for, and my gang knows 'm here
So in fifteen minutes one or both is coming down that highway
You pack up the Gat Man's truck, whatever you can fit in ten minutes, and you drive North away from the city
Where are you going
Joe takes the Frog Buzzer from his pocket, presses it
Sara's buzzes in her pocket
One buzz means come and get me
Two or nothing, don't
He vanishes into the stalks, towards the highway
' Crowded with Gat Men, all preparing
1 We got everyone here
All our men
Arm a em up, let's go
103
Abe turns, annoyed, and sees the security monitor
On the screen - Kid Blue rips the sack off and holds Old Joe's bloodied face up to the camera
( ) got him Abe
got him
Well
Shhhhhit
The door buzzes open
Kid pushes Old Joe through the long entrance hallway, past a dozen Gat Men, who watch him with shocked amazement
Old Joe's hands bound back
Kid Blue glows
He comes to the tiny coat check room, and Big Craig stops him, then sees Old Joe
Hoh
So both we got
Just the Looper
got him
Knew he went for whores, so  checked every building
They found Joe too though, in a farm on the east side
That's why all the Gats are here, the whole crew's arming up to make a sweep
Joe fuck Joe, save your bullets got the Looper
Not such a fuck up huh
'm taking him up to This happens very fast: Old Joe uses his legs to kick himself off the wall and back into Kid Blue,  him against the opposite wall
Old Joe grabs (behind his back) Kid Blue's gun, and blasts one shot through the chains binding his wrists and into the Kid's midsection
He whips the gun from behind his back and shoots Big Craig in the face
Then blasts the Gat Men in the entrance hallway while he reaches into the coat check and pulls an automatic rifle
He blasts like hell into the hallway
few shots return but mostly the men are trapped
Then it's over
All is smoky still for a moment
104
Old Joe stares at the exit door ajar, down the long hallway jammed with bodies
Then at the passage that leads deeper into the club
Gat Man runs in, and Old Joe shoots him down
He steps into the coat check and loads his pockets with guns and grenades
Then launches himself into passageway towards the club
Old Joe weaves his way through the backstage area, chucking grenades in front of him, then unloading his automatic rifle into the smoky aftermath
And with a mixture of dumb luck and skill from years of being gangland muscle takes out Gat Man after Gat Man
The corridors are tight, twisty
Old Joe uses that
Throwing grenades
Blasting away
Purging
Killing everyone he lays eyes on
Wiping them out
All the bad guys
It's horrible
Men maimed, bleeding and crying, dying the way people actually die from gunshots
Old Joe forges on, deeper
' Empty
Old Joe kicks the door open
Takes it in, the office
Hammer on the desk
He reloads a gun
Eyes find the door to Abe's inner den
' Abe and two Gat Men, guns out, crouched behind the table
Watching the door
display screen shows Old Joe on the other side
Abe, eyes dull
Shouts at the door Joe
Guess  put the gun in that kid's hand, huh Joe
Guess everything comes back around
Like your goddamn ties
' Old Joe
Breathing hard
Reloaded
Closes the gun
Joe breaks out of the corn, panting
He steps out into the middle of the highway
Storm clouds on the horizon
He cleans and readies his Blunderbuss
105
- Kid Blue's eyes flutter open
He lifts himself painfully
Checks his chest
Most of the shot caught his shoulder, his chest is grazed
The Gat Men in the hall
Big Craig
All dead
Kid Blue wanders the smoky halls
Dead and dying men
' Abe, shot once in the head, twice in the chest
Kid Blue stands over them
Stunned
Tears well in his eyes
Then on the wall, he sees the map
The farm circled in red
- Clothes and boxes piled in the back of Jesse's truck
Sara loads one last bundle
Calls to Cid, in the front seat
Ok baby, we're going
Joe waits
Then, a    on the distant highway
He tenses
The cloud gets closer
It is a truck
An armored truck
Joe squints
It's the   that Kid Blue loaded his gold bricks into
The front windshield blown in
The truck stops fifty feet away, and Old Joe steps out
He throws a gold bar, which lands in the dusty highway between them
Bon jour
You take this truck, you take your money, and you go live your life
No one's coming after you
fixed it
And you go kill the boy
That's how you fix it
That's how
You got your life back, you better think right now about what that's worth to you
My life
Your life
Becoming you
106
Joe raises his Blunderbuss and
Too far away, the shot scatters
The old man flinches, backs away
Joe walks forward towards Old Joe, stepping over the gold
Stupid little shit
You let him live, he's gonna take away everything that's yours, everything that's mine
You seen what the boy's gonna become
haven't seen that yet
Joe fires again, close enough now to draw blood off Old Joe's chest and knock him back
Out of nowhere a   careens around the van, which has until now blocked our line of sight down the highway
Kid Blue
The bike clips Joe's leg, sending him spinning violently to the dusty pavement
The bike shoots off down the highway, a cloud of dust in its wake
It takes a hundred yards for the Kid to pull it to a stop and spin it around
Joe is hurt bad
He grapples for his blunderbuss
Kid Blue guns the engine, gat in hand
Levels it, steady as a rock
Joe shoots at the Kid, but he's out of range, the gun fires scattershot
Kid Blue fires, a bullet hits dangerously close to Joe
Panicked, Joe begins firing at the pavement around him, round after fiery round
Kicking up dust
Lots of dust
Raising a cloud
'  - zooming towards Joe, now obscured in a cloud of dust and smoke
He fires his gat into the cloud, tries to slow the bike but can't in time
In the dust cloud Joe hears the bike roaring down upon him
He covers up and when he feels the bike roaring past blindly his buss
moment later the bike emerges from the dust cloud
Without a driver
It skids, crashes
When the dust clears away Joe lies still, arms over his head
107
Besides him, the broken remains of Kid Blue
Painfully, Joe raises himself
Then realizes: Old Joe is gone
Sara starts the truck up
Here we go
Give it a wave goodbye
They roll down the dirt road that leads to the highway
At the far end of it, at a distance but walking towards them, is the dark figure of Old Joe
Gun in hand
Sara hesitates a minute, then guns it
Straight for him
Duck down baby Stop please he can shoot us Just stay down Half the distance closed, but he's still far off
shot cracks the front grill, another cracks the windshield
Stop
The truck lurches horribly, and flips straight back in a graceful arc, landing upsidown
Sara and Cid, dazed, hanging by their seatbelts
Are you ok
'm sorry In the rear view mirror, Sara sees Old Joe getting closer
You're ok
'mon baby we have to run now
108
She unfastens them and they both climb out, and Old Joe stops suddenly, taking aim
Sara pulls Cid behind the flatbed for cover as two bullets glance off the overturned truck
(') We're going into the fields want you to run, 'll be right behind you, don't look back
Okay
Old Joe lowers his gun and runs towards them
(') Go
They both sprint off the road
-   & The wide bare field
Cid runs ahead towards the corn, Sara not far behind
The earth soft, their feet sink in, like a nightmare
- Old Joe crosses the road and chases them onto the field, firing at them on the run
-   & Bullets thunk in the earth
Sara stumbles, exhausted
Cid turns, about thirty feet ahead of her
- Old Joe stops running and steadies his gun
-   & distant gunshot
fan of crimson blood sprays from Cid's head
His neck twists and he crumples to the ground
Sara is stopped in her tracks by an invisible force
(') No Cid no
The topsoil of the earth around them  in a fine dust
- Old Joe reacts as the topsoil rises, an eerie moment
109
-   & Sara struggles to reach Cid but is still about twenty feet behind him
Cid raises his head
The bullet grazed his jawline
Not severe but lots of blood
Cid's eyes locked hateful on Old Joe
Blood soaks his shirt
Far behind him, the barn splinters apart as if in a tornado
No
With a sudden jolt the field ripples out from Cid, like a stone thrown in a pond
Sara lifts into the air
- Old Joe is hefted off the ground
His gun falls
- Joe struggling through the fields, limping, desperate
Something like a furious wind rushes through the stalks
-   & Cid stands
Intense, eyes dark, in another place
- Old Joe, suspended mid-air, realizes what's about to happen
He lifts his hand defensively and -   & Cid's face straining, about to scream
Cid's focus adjusts from Old Joe to Sara
She floats, reaching out to him
Frightened
Yelling something he can't hear but he can see her eyes
Cid's face breaks
He barely mouths the word And everything
Sara, Old Joe, the earth
All comes crashing down
- The corn stalks shiver then are still
110
Joe breaks out of the stalks and onto the field
Gasping for breath
Gets his bearings
In the far distance across the field, Old Joe, Sara and Cid
Too far
-   & Cid runs to Sara, who sits up slowly
They embrace
You did good, baby
You did so good
love you
Behind them, Old Joe struggles to his feet
Sara kisses Cid
(') Into the fields
Run now baby
Go
No no mom no You go
She pushes him away and Cid runs
Then she turns
Standing her ground
Directly between Old Joe and Cid
Old Joe  in the mud, fumbles his gun
Sees Cid approaching the safety of the
Blocked by Sara
Move
- Still too far away, struggling as fast as he can, helpless as Old Joe closes in on Sara
He fires his buss at Old Joe, but is way out of range
-    & Old Joe gets his gun, rises with it
Cid about to hit the stalks
Sara between them
- Cid nears the corn fields, running
Seconds from safety
111
-    & Old Joe
Gun raised
Pocket watch wrapped around it
His wife's picture in it
Clear as day
No time to move around Sara
Now or never
- Joe running, useless gun in hand
No
-    & Sara, not going anywhere
'm sorry He pulls the trigger
- Joe running
Time slows
Watching: -   & Everything is a little surreal
Dream-like
Slow
Old Joe shoots Sara
We hear no gunshot
Just the wind in the corn, and young Joe's breathing
She falls, giving him a clear shot at Cid
- : - Just as Old Joe gets him in his sights, Cid breaches the corn fields and is gone, vanishing in the stalks
Old Joe lowers his gun, stunned but still frantic
He stumbles towards the corn, still far off, his face breaking
Trips, falls in the mud
Corn field vast in front of him
Cid is gone
He lost him
He holds his pocket watch
Sobs
Lost
- : 112
On the horizon, a train
- : / Cid sits in a darkened car, holding a bloody rag to his jaw
- Joe watching, seeing: / Cid's face
Bloody
Dirty
His eyes full of hate
The train rumbles towards the dark city
- Joe watches
Sees, in his mind's eye, all of this
And through all of this we have only heard the wind
And Joe breathing
Time hanging, slowed nearly to a stop
moment of decision
Joe turns his blunderbuss back on himself and
-    & Revealing that all we saw was in Joe's head, and we are still in the moment where Old Joe is about to shoot Sara
But this time, just as he's pulling the trigger, a distant shot is heard
And Old Joe
Sara stands shell shocked just for a moment
Then she doesn't process any of it, she just turns and yells - Cid stops just shy of the corn
Turns back to the field
There's his mom, Sara, unharmed and smiling
The bad man is gone
The field is empty
113
-   ' We don't see Joe, but far across the field Cid runs to his mom, into her arms
Sara lifts him, holds him
-   & She carries him
Walking fast back towards a far distant figure lying still on the edge of the field
Joe
Then a faint buzz
The flasher, in her pocket
She pulls it out
Two flashes
She slows
Stops
Looking at him, far away
Two flashes
Where's Joe
He had to go away, baby
He took the bad man with him
She kisses him
-  ' In the distance, Sara turns away and carries Cid back towards the farmhouse
' Sara bathes Cid, dresses the wound on his jaw
' She tucks Cid in, holds him close
Kisses his forehead
- Sara emerges from the ruined front door, crosses the porch
Sara crosses the lawn, and walks across the field
Joe's body
Sara goes to him, slowly
She kneels beside him
His pocket watch in the dirt
Open
No photo inside
Ticking away
Around and around
She closes it
Touches his hair
The wind through the corn
After a long while, the sun breaks through the clouds
