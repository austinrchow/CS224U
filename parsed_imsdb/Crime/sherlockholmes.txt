Fog in the air
Full moon
(
) The year was 1891
London was the capital of the world -- the height of modernity, with the hiss of steam and smell of coal in the air
It was also the great cesspool into which all the sinners and criminals of the empire drained

The life  found was anything but nice and steady
We can see that the  wears a cape
The distinctive silhouette of his deerstalker hat is unmistakable in the distance
The  tugs on a pipe and turns towards the growing stampede

Send the bill to John Watson, 221B Baker Street
Sherlock Holmes sprints off down an alleyway
The takes a step into the road to watch him go -- -- and is nearly flattened for good by the first of a number of  , hurtling by on a serious pursuit, Victorian-style

Big, uniformed guys assemble their weaponry -- a 19th century  team
One man stands out as a leader, older than the rest,
man in plainclothes sits to one side of the officers: , physically as tough as anyone else in the carriage, but with a more pensive air about him thinking man of action

-                                    3 Almost tipping over, the carriage turns onto the Embankment and hurtles through the writhing fog along the river
As the carriage banks, we see Holmes cut across the carriage path again, taking a line the horses cannot follow
: Holmes bursts out of an alley, sprints round a corner and runs across a courtyard to a side door
to see the

-  -                      5 Holmes enters through the door and stands at the top of a stairwell
He takes a moment to recover; he's fit, but not as fit as he used to be
Holmes descends the stairwell to a door and a spiral staircase beyond it
He stops at the doorway and peers round the corner
lantern glow ascends the spiral stairway towards Holmes
Holmes withdraws into the shadows behind the door
-  ascends the stairs, carrying the lantern and a gun
He peers behind the door and holds the lantern up to the shadows, but does not see Holmes, who has pulled his black jacket up to conceal his face
The man swings the lantern away again
He peers about, confused
We see Holmes' eyes from the shadows, as he lowers his jacket and thinks through his plan of attack
(
) Head cocked to the left, partial deafness in right ear
First point of attack
-  - the spot behind the man's right ear, just at the top of the jaw -- the most vulnerable point
Holmes launches a hammer blow, and we ramp from 24 fps to 400 fps (  ) as he makes contact
The man's head is thrown back as he spins round
(
) Then throat, paralyze vocal chords, stop screaming
24 fps
The man's mouth opens to cry out
We 400 fps as his Adam's Apple is struck with a precision karate chop, strangling his scream
(
) Stink of alcohol, heavy drinker -- knuckles to liver
24 fps,   400 fps as a devastating knuckle-punch to the liver doubles up the bowler-hatted thug and crumples him to his knees

Hammer blow to ear
Karate chop to throat
Knuckle punch to liver
as the man crumples to the ground, Holmes takes his bowler hat from his head and flips it onto his own in one super fast move
Holmes drags the battered man into the shadows, lifts his lantern and proceeds down the spiral staircase
- Another bowler-hatted  approaches the bottom of the staircase
He has seen the lantern light
He draws his gun and approaches
Holmes places the lantern on the post at the bottom of the bannister, ducks down into the shadows
What's goin' on, John
When he gets no answer, the  points his gun to where we saw Holmes hide
But Holmes appears from the shadows behind the , reaches around him, grabs his gun hand and pistol-whips him twice with his own gun, dropping him
Holmes extracts a cigar from the Thug's top pocket and sniffs it appreciatively
Hhhmm, good cigar
Who do you work for
He jams the cigar in his own top pocket, picks up the man's bowler and proceeds on, further down into the crypts

Eyes alive with intelligence, processing angles when -- falls on his shoulder
to reveal -- (The following exchange in whispers
) Watson
Perfect timing
Nice hat
Just got it
Where's Lestrade
Getting his troops in formation
Is that your blood or theirs
don't know
It's an old shirt
You left this behind
Watson hands him his pistol
Holmes looks at it with distaste, doesn't take it
Knew 'd forgotten something
Thought 'd left the stove on
You did
Right
Shall we
This is what they do
This is what they like
: The two   on guard turn fast and gather together as they hear footsteps approaching

He is more of a brawler, using headbutts, knees, and elbows
Less artful, but no less effective

-  -                       9 Thugs dispatched, Holmes and Watson look down and see a chilling sight
- (five-sided figure), lit with candles at each corner
Her eyes roll back in her head, trance-like
sword has been placed at her feet
next to the pentacle
This is
We do not yet see his face
stands on the edge of the ceremony, shrouded in shadow
We do not see his face
Suddenly, the woman rises up like a broken puppet, as if pulled to her feet by invisible hands
Some kind of ritual is about to climax
Holmes and Watson head down, fast, not caring if they make a noise or not
Their footsteps echo
9A                                                                9A The second hooded figure moves back and melts into the shadows
Still kneeling, still hooded, Blackwood chants softly, Latin incantation repeating and repeating
as her lips start to move in time with the incantation
This is spooky, real, powerful stuff
Holmes and Watson leap from the stairs to Blackwood's level
Blackwood simply ignores them
The Latin incantation never stops
Holmes is closer to the girl, Watson closer to Blackwood
The girl

9A   :                                                     9A The girl bends with alarming and mechanical suddenness, picks up the sword and turns it on herself, ready to plunge the point into her heart
Holmes lunges, grabs the woman's arm, disarms her and pulls her out of the pentacle
She collapses
Simultaneously and eerily the candles extinguish and a rush of air departs the tunnel
Blackwood throws back his hood
We finally see his face
His eyes are intense, he is tapped into something dark and cruel
Holmes and Watson are shocked at his identity
Lord Blackwood
Blackwood applauds softly, strangely
Well done, Holmes
And Watson as well
Watson raises his gun, trains it on Blackwood
Stay right there
Blackwood raises his hands in front of him, almost mockingly
Tell me, doctor, as a medical man, how did you like my work
(beat) The fifth one was so scrawny, it was over before 'd finished the first incision
That's more than Watson can take
He moves in to pistol- whip Blackwood -- -- is stopped suddenly by Holmes' hand grabbing his collar
No
Watson struggles forward against Holmes' grip
Look

9A   : (2)                                                9A Holmes seems to be pointing at Blackwood
Watson looks, sees nothing
Look
Watson looks, and sees it and his eyes flare wide
'   is the needle-pointed end of a    - , almost invisible -- -- the other end held between Blackwood's hands really nasty concealed weapon
One more step and Watson gets impaled in the eye
What a shame
That would've been fun
We hear heavy boots on the balcony, as Lestrade and his men finally appear
flood the area
Impeccable timing, Lestrade
(vis Blackwood) Is that --
It is
(re: girl) We've gone for the doctor
(re: Blackwood) And one for the rope
You should've waited for my help
If  had, you'd be cleaning up a corpse and chasing a rumor
Besides, the girl's parents hired me, not the Yard
(a wry smile) can't imagine why they thought you'd need any assistance

9A    : (3)                                              9A Lestrade turns, frustrated
He watches his men yank Blackwood out of his double circle, put chains on him, while others carry the girl away on a stretcher
She's still mouthing the incantation
Lestrade eyes the double circle, the pentacle, shakes his head, not understanding them
Grudgingly, reluctantly, hating himself for needing to, he turns to Holmes
What do you make of that
Some kind of ceremony
Five girls killed beneath cathedrals at the height of the full moon
(indicating) The double circle's for his own protection
London will breathe a sigh of relief -- -- at the excellent work of Scotland Yard
As usual
Bravo, Lestrade
Have a cigar
Holmes sticks the villain's cigar in Lestrade's pocket and -- --    lifts his massive camera
An explosion of light and sparks as a 19th century flashbulb pops
The  is  bright for a split-second and then it

No -- ground floor

-                                     13 As Watson exits his apartment and moves down the hall, , his landlady, shoots up the stairs with the paper
Her nerves are almost as bad as Captain Philips'
(panting) won't go in there by myself, not while he's in this state
You're not going in at all
Which is a relief to Mrs
Hudson
What will  do when you leave
He'll burn the house down around me
What will he do
Couldn't you have a longer engagement
He just needs a new case, that's all
Captain Philips emerges from Watson's apartment, heads towards them
smell burning
Mrs
Hudson's already-frayed nerves take a turn for the worse
Watson takes the newspaper from her
Why don't you take Captain Philips and give him a nice cup of tea
Come on, Captain, let's go down
It'll be quieter
(as they leave) And perhaps some tea and bread up here when you can
Watson heads down the hallway to the last door tendril of smoke wafts out from under it
Urgent

13   :                                                    13 Nonetheless, Watson   stops, takes a deep breath, gathers himself
Something    like this has happened before (is, in fact, Holmes' usual   brand of chaos) the difference being, now, that Watson is   sick to death of dealing with it
Which doesn't mean he won't
Newspaper in hand, Watson opens the door, pokes his head in, cautiously
He sees -- 14
221
- '                        14 Watson squeezes through the doorway to find that the obstruction is Holmes who is sitting in the dark on a chair, blocking the door, aiming a gun (with an odd contraption fastened on its barrel) at the wall
Unadulterated chaos
series of blasted into the wall in the (ragged) initials "
" May  join you in the armory
Please
Watson, 've been working on a device which will suppress the sound of a gunshot
Watson heads towards the conservatory
Please
Don't, don't, don't
Watson pulls open the curtains allowing the light to pour in
It needs work
May  see
Watson passes him heading to the other side of the room (possibly grabs the gun) picking up a pile of open letters from a table
Gently, gently, Watson
Watson whips open more curtains and opens a window
Holmes crawls on his hands and knees over to a table where he finds his sunglasses and puts them on
Watson sits on a chair and begins to leaf though the letters

About time you found another one
can't but agree
My mind rebels at stagnation
Give me problems, give me work
The sooner the better
Paper
Watson hands Holmes the newspaper
Let's see, we have a letter here from Mrs
Ramsey in Queen's Park -- her husband has gone missing
He's in Belgium with the scullery maid
Is it December
Yes, Holmes
Lady Radford reports a missing emerald bracelet
Insurance swindle
Lord Radford likes fast women and slow ponies
see you're the attending physician at Blackwood's hanging
Yes, it's our last case together and  wanted to see it through to the end
Awkward pause
Cough
Mr
Lewis is seeking
Mrs
Hudson enters carrying a tray of bread and tea
She is steeling herself for this interaction
(to Watson) There is only one case that intrigues me at present
the curious case of Mrs
Hudson, the absentee landlady

Tea, Mr
Holmes
Mrs
Hudson crosses to Holmes and puts the tray before him
Is it poisoned, nanny
There's enough of that in you already
She goes to remove an old tray from behind him
Don't touch that
Everything is in its proper place, as per usual
She ignores him and removes the tray then crosses back towards the door noticing a bulldog lying unconscious under the table
He's killed the dog
again
Watson jumps up
His bulldog, , lies on the floor in a drugged stupor
What have you done to Gladstone this time
was simply testing a new anesthetic
He doesn't mind
Holmes
As your doctor
He'll be right as a trivet in no time
Watson's finally had enough

There's nothing of interest to me out there, on earth, at all
So, you have nothing to do
Nothing
Then you're free this evening
Absolutely
For dinner
Wonderful

My favorite
Mary's coming
Not available
You're meeting her, Holmes
Have you proposed yet
'm still looking for the right ring

Then it's not official

Half past eight
The Royale
The dog wakes up and runs out
And wear a jacket
Watson exits, leaving Holmes alone in his own chaos
For the first time, we see a hint of fear in his eyes
: 15
-                                 15 Holmes sits in the center of a booth waiting for Watson to arrive
He is quite uncomfortable in this setting
-- he picks up little pieces of information from the other guests
He notices the details on a pair of gentleman's cufflinks, the name on a bottle of wine, a surreptitious argument between waiters
It all becomes quite overbearing
And then Watson and Mary arrive, talking, intent on each other -- surprised when they realize Holmes is already there
Holmes
You're early
Fashionably
May  present Miss Mary Morstan
Holmes looks at   -- looks again
She's beautiful, 30s, and clearly a woman worth marrying
Holmes stands
She extends her hand
My pleasure
For the life of me don't know why it's taken him so long to get us properly introduced
Holmes gestures politely, they sit, Mary and Watson on either side of him
There is a decanted bottle of wine on the table
The pleasure's mine
It really is a thrill to meet you, Mr
Holmes

Making these grand assumptions out of tiny details
(livening up) Oh, no no
The little details are by far the most important
Take Watson
intend to
Watson likes that, Holmes less so -- a forced chuckle
see that walking-stick rare African snakewood hiding a blade of high-tensile steel few were awarded to veterans of the Afghan war, so  can assume he's a decorated soldier
Strong, brave, born to be a man of action
And neat, like all military men
Then  check his pockets
ah stub from a boxing match
Now can infer he's a bit of a gambler
(a wink) 'd keep an eye on that, by the way
Those days are behind me
Yes, right behind you
(leaning in to Mary) He's cost us the rent more than once
Mary laughs
With all due respect, Mr
Holmes, you know him
But what about a perfect stranger
What can you tell about me
Holmes and Watson exchange a glance -- not a good idea
don't think that's necessary -- () 17A

You insist
(at Watson) She insisted
(instantly) You're a governess
Well done
Yes, well done
So shall we -- Your student's a boy of 8
Charlie's 7, actually
Watson's getting nervous, reaches for the wine
Holmes stops him
It's breathing

Is there ink on my face
The  appears
There's nothing wrong with your face
The gentleman has already ordered for himself
(to Watson) What would madam care for this evening
Watson gives Holmes a hard look:   that's a bit much
Give us a few minutes, please
He shakes his head, pours wine for all
There are two drops on your ear
India blue's nearly impossible to wash off, anyway
very impetuous act by the boy, but you're too experienced to react rashly -- which is why the lady you work for lent you that necklace
It's from Asprey's, flawless, not the gems of a governess
(beat) However, the jewels you're not wearing tell us rather more

Both Watson and Mary scorch Holmes with their eyes
Holmes pauses
pauses, then: You were engaged
Holmes' mind has gotten away from him
He begins talking faster, intensely focused, manic
The ring is gone
But the lighter skin where it sat suggests you spent some time abroad wearing it proudly
As Holmes talks, Watson gets up, moves to help Mary to her feet
They're leaving
Or at least until someone informed you of its true and rather modest worth, at which point you broke off the engagement and returned to England for better prospects doctor perhaps
Mary throws Watson's wine in Holmes' face
The restaurant goes silent
She turns to leave, turns back
(low) Right on all counts but one didn't leave my fiance
he died
Now she leaves -- () 20
15     : (6)                                               15 Well done, old man
-- and Watson goes with her
Holmes lets the wine drip down over him
She's lovely
Holmes is left at an empty table with wine running down his face
Their orders arrive -- an array of plates piled high
The waiter puts them down, Holmes very carefully unfolds his napkin and places it into the top of his shirt, spaghetti style, takes his knife and fork and begins to cut the meat -- then pauses, looks around
' Happy couples eating, laughing, talking
Suddenly, Holmes hears no words
He just sees their mouths moving
The sound of silverware clinking and scraping on fine china rises to an   -- -- which becomes the  of a -  as a fist smashes into a face with a
15A-17
- -   - 5A-17 Holmes staggers back from the blow
He tastes his own blood from a split lip
It interests him
He is stripped to the waist, all sinew and gristle
His opponent, McMURDO -- huge but flabby -- bangs his fists together and moves in
Bets rage back and forth through the pressing
' The room and the fight are calm -- the sounds muffled and indistinct -- a complete sensory reversal of his experience in the restaurant
This is soothing to him, the ring is the only place where his mind stops racing

15A-17 :                                               15A-17 He's able to feel, not just think
He is utterly in the moment
Holmes' hawk-sharp gaze darts down from McMurdo's face to his muscles as they flex, giving him just enough warning to move his head so that a punch grazes him
McMurdo throws a storm of punches, most of which Holmes ducks or blocks
He throws nothing in return, sometimes even drops his hands, just using his reflexes to protect himself
Once or twice, he reaches out and gently touches McMurdo's face or throat, when the big man leaves an obvious opening
But that's all
Holmes is completely in control -- -- until he notices a face at ringside
Early thirties, a look of pure intrigue in her eyes and a slight smile on her lips as she watches the detective
Holmes'  returns to normal when he sees her, the sound floods back into the room
McMurdo senses his opponent's lapse in concentration and steps on Holmes' foot, tramping him and -- He knocks Holmes down with a thunderous right
Holmes rolls over, stands, shakes his head to clear the cobwebs
He looks for the woman
She's gone
He turns back to McMurdo, smiles
Well done
Thank you
Holmes begins walking away
McMURDO Oi
We ain't done here
(walking away) Not done
Finished
And as said, thank you, it was most pleasurable

15A-17 : (2)                                             15A-17 Face twisted in disgust, McMurdo strides forward and at Holmes, catching him on the back of the head
The crowd falls silent
Holmes stops
Feels the back of his head, smells his hand
Hm
Plymouth gin
He turns
Steps back into the ring
The crowd applauds, working into a fever pitch, but from Holmes' , all is calm
His eyes tick slowly, scanning McMurdo, locking onto the big man's knee: little scar-tissue, nearly invisible
As McMurdo braces for combat -- Instantly Holmes unleashes a series of superfast moves, incorporating exotic martial arts
The blinding combination culminates with a spinning kick to the big man's knee, which buckles altogether wrong
McMurdo falls, over and out
Holmes is already turning away before the giant hits the canvas
He sees the crowd fall silent, they're not sure if they like it, there really isn't any sport
He doesn't care
Passing fellow fighters and flirty barmaids, Holmes strides out of the bar, battered on the outside, soothed inside
He grabs a bottle in his hand
Taking a huge swig, he climbs the stairs towards the upstairs rooms
18A                                                                   18A -  - candle shivers, casting jagged shadows
row of stone cells
The sound of prisoners  in the dark full-scale riot is on
Five  charge down the corridor, banging on the doors to quiet the prisoners

Charlie, what the hell's going on down here

And now he's in some kind of fit
The Guard Captain continues around the corner
We see another guard, , lies convulsing on the floor
(to the prisoners in the cell next to Blackwood) You lot shut it
(to the guards) Charlie, get, down here and get him to the infirmary
The guards pick Charlie up and carry him away

Eyes closed, ungodly sounds
On the walls the scrawls of a madman: wild symbols, sketches of animals, a headless sphinx, an upside-down cross
hint of some method to his madness
All right, Blackwood, what's this all about
've a request
You don't get nothin' `til you stop this devil nonsense
That's a holy book -- Blackwood closes his eyes again, resumes his soft murmur
(louder) -- and you will respect it
Blackwood starts whispering
Boy, you want me to muzzle you -- Suddenly, the Captain starts
He's confused
He coughs harder
Prisoners watch him stumble backwards

The Captain falls to one knee, keeps coughing
Finally the Captain   , spits it out onto the stone floor
He looks down, horrified: It's a small   on a chain
Prisoners start

Other guards run up, terrified

With a look of resignation, he opens the door to see Holmes sitting alone in the sterile, barely furnished room
Holmes faces the corner, playing scales on his
On the table next to him, an upside down   and an assortment of prescription medicine bottles
Watson approaches, sees Holmes has bloodshot eyes from lack of sleep
Watson picks one of the medicine bottles which is open
You know this is for eye surgery

It's a pathological amorbic process, it increases tissue change and weakness
And you know what a black reaction comes on you afterwards
No answer

If you play a chromatic scale, they move clockwise
As soon as you switch to a pentatonic scale -- Holmes plays a different scale, the flies all stop moving, stick to the glass
(faking interest) Really
What about when you -- oops -- Watson picks up the glass, lets loose the flies
Holmes looks up; Watson's already moving for the door, pissed

They sit in silence, tension hanging between them
Finally Holmes grabs Watson's bag, rummages around and pulls out a clean white shirt
Watson looks out the window, frustrated
He sees -
Near ground level, workers take down a large   sign
Look at that structure
What has it been
Five years' work already
Are you aware that is the first combination of bascule and suspension bridge
Very innovative
No reply
As Holmes is taking off his jacket, he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a wad of money

You weren't there so  laid your customary bet -- Silence
Holmes takes off his shirt
You're right
'll keep it with your check book, locked safely away in my drawer
Silence
Holmes pulls on the clean shirt
The opera house is featuring Don Giovanni and  could easily procure two tickets if you had some cultural inclination this evening
Silence
You have the grand gift of silence, Watson
It makes you quite invaluable as a companion
Watson punches him square in the face
And your grand gift is the uncanny ability to demoralize people was aware she'd been engaged
She told me
Holmes rubs his jaw
So that's a `no' to the opera then
Watson's steaming
Holmes puts on his vest
That's my waistcoat
It's too small for you
Well, it's my property and  want it back

There's something about him
it's like he can get inside your head
Holmes can see how spooked the Guard is
'm sure  can find my own way from here, if you have other duties to attend to
Much obliged, sir
Thank you, thank you
The Guard high-tails it out of there

No way this creep's getting to him
In the shadows he can barely make out Blackwood, who's reading aloud to himself
Holmes listens, getting closer

Blackwood pauses, turns, sees Holmes
They share a smile -- two heavyweights sizing each other up

How can  help
'd already followed the murders with some interest and while my heart went out to the families of the victims,  couldn't but notice a criminal mastery in the stroke of your brush -- You're too kind
However, by comparison, your work in the crypt was akin to a finger painting
Suddenly, Blackwood is right at the bars, close to Holmes
So now you're curious as to whether there's a larger game afoot, and that's why you're really here
Actually, my friend will pronounce you dead shortly and  thought might keep him company
Allow me to enlighten you
Your mistake is to imagine that anything earthly has led to this moment
Your error in judgement is to assume 've been holding the brush at all --  am merely the channel
Despite the bars between them, the men are close together
Holmes seems to be studying Blackwood's ear

might have spared five lives
Those lives were a necessity, a sacrifice
Five otherwise meaningless creatures called to serve a greater purpose
wonder if they'd let Watson and dissect your brain -- after you're hanged, of course
'd wager there's some deformity that would be scientifically significant
Then you would serve a greater purpose, too
Mr
Holmes, you must widen your gaze
'm concerned you underestimate the gravity of coming events
(beat) For you and  are bound on a journey that will twist the very fabric of nature
(beat) sense fragility beneath your mask of logic, and it worries me
Steel your mind, Holmes,  need you
Holmes steps back, shakes his head

But  will rise again
Bon voyage, Blackwood
As Holmes walks away, Blackwood calls after him
Pay attention
Three more shall die, and there is nothing you can do to save them

Gets three cosh-strikes across the chin, dropping him immediately
Still holding the roses, the man finds himself smacked up against the bricks with Irene's hand over his mouth
Quick as a snake, she slices upwards with a razor-sharp knife, cutting his belt, then his clothes, all the way to his collar
The move ends with Irene's finger over her own mouth, signalling the mugger to be quiet
He obeys, eyes bulging
Irene frisks him expertly
She's mugging the mugger
There is excitement in her eyes; this turns her on

Holmes picks up the pace
He snatches a  from a one-eyed old  with his hand out
He drops a coin in his hand, then another coin and snatches the beggar's eye patch too
He runs past a coal cart, snags a lump of coal, rubs it on his face and hands, then pops it in his mouth, chews it to blacken his teeth
He pauses to singe the sleeve of Watson's coat on a fairground fire-breather's flames, runs on

Watson, grab a compass
You means us
Us means you
It's Lord Blackwood, sir
It appears he's come back from the dead
Well that's clever seeing as how pronounced him dead myself
groundsman saw him walking through the graves, just this morning
'll leave this one in your capable hands
have tea with Mary and her parents this evening
Watson walks into his office
It is not my reputation at stake here
Are you taking this seriously
Like it or not, it's a matter of professional integrity
No girl wants to marry a doctor who can't tell if a man's dead or not
They all move to the exit
Watson, you'd do well to hide your medical certificates in case they're revoked
Clarky laughs

Holmes and Watson exit, Watson carries a black leather They walk up the pathway towards the Blackwood Family Crypt
Watson barely lifts his head, scanning the ground while Holmes appears to have taken an interest in a clump of trees in the distance
Look at this mess
Nothing but standard-issue police bootprints
Any possible evidence there might have been has been trampled

Police lamps light one large marble
The cops are in tight clusters, whispering to themselves, spooked
They'd rather be anywhere but here
As Holmes and Watson approach, they see the marble doors of the crypt have been
Holmes and Watson share a quick glance -- this is interesting
Lestrade emerges from the crypt
He is sweating, shaken

Look at those slabs of marble -- they're half a ton each if they're a pound -- smashed outward like they were nothing
On second thought, Lestrade does take Holmes' handkerchief
Explain it if you can, Holmes
Holmes inspects the door, checking the hinges
He notices the Blackwood , and the image of a
And the coffin
We're digging it up now
The witness is over there
You can question him if you like -- but you won't get much
The old , pale and terrified, stands out of the rain under an ancient cypress tree
Watson heads for him
Holmes disappears in the opposite direction
As soon as their backs are turned, Lestrade marches over to a nervous knot of cops, grabs a fistful of blue in each hand, drags his boys in close
He doesn't want Holmes or Watson to hear this
(low, angry) If you lot don't stop behaving like a bunch of superstitious milk maids, you're on double-time
You're an embarrassment
Also, you're forbidden to talk about this to anyone, not a word
Are we bloody clear on that
The cops nod, duly chastened

Watson immediately goes into doctor mode checking his pulse, looking in his eyes
The Groundskeeper just keeps praying
Watson takes a boiled sweet from his pocket, pops it in the man's mouth and gently sits him down
Holmes walks over holding a small branch from a tree
He's in shock
We should give him a few moments
Lestrade stomps up
The witness stated that he saw Lord Blackwood rise from the grave
(at Watson, accusingly) Well
You pronounced the man dead
(stung) He had no pulse
Inspector, do you know if this is a spruce or a sycamore
Lestrade shakes his head
It hasn't been a good day for him, or the Yard
There's a clunk
They all turn to see the coffin has been extracted from the crypt
Four beefy, soil-stained cops emerge lugging the coffin
They place it on the ground, step back, crossing themselves, murmuring, plainly terrified
Holmes chuckles

The cops pass a  around as if it were red-hot
Watson's had enough
He marches forward -- -- snatches the crowbar away, jams it under the lid and levers it off with a slow, eerie groan
Holmes and Lestrade move forward, the cops move backward
The coffin is filled with , overflowing
They brush away a layer of dirt, to reveal
in the coffin
The body is a much smaller man than Blackwood, in everyday clothes, with red hair
That's not Blackwood
Now that we have a firm grasp of the obvious
Watson opens his forensic kit, disturbed
Vials, silver tools
He takes a , begins examining the body
Lividity is late stage
Diptera deposits are approximately -- (measuring) -- three quarters of an inch, putting the time of death at ten to twelve hours ago
Inspector, may  see your pen
Lestrade hands over a nice fountain pen, still stunned
Holmes takes the pen and pries open the corpse's mouth, revealing: two missing teeth in the man's jaw
Missing two incisors in the upper jaw
(a look at Holmes) Adler's midget
Holmes spots something glinting in the man's dirt-filled pocket
He uses the pen to fish out: a
All yours, Inspector
Holmes hands the pen back to Lestrade
Lestrade looks at it with dismay, takes it in Holmes' handkerchief -- a small measure of revenge

Lestrade follows, anxious
Holmes shows him the dusty pocket watch
Scratches around the keyhole where the watch is wound
Most drunks are the same, and pawnbrokers scratch the ticket number and their initials inside the lid
This one has five, so the owner -- (
) He was walking
They all stop, suddenly
The old Groundskeeper stands in front of them, ready to unburden himself
(quivering voice) He was walking but his feet didn't touch the ground
And 'm not daft,  know what  saw and  know Lord Blackwood
He was as alive as you or me
It's not right
It's not natural
(turns, leaves) Our Father Who art in heaven
(etc
) All three men watch the Groundskeeper go
sudden gust of wind moans eerily
They all want to get the hell out of there
Now the game is afoot, Watson

Holmes complies hungrily and they start to stroll along
Watson appears preoccupied
You know, 've seen things in war that  couldn't explain
once heard a man predict his death, down to the number and placement of the bullet holes that killed him
You have to admit that a supernatural explanation is at least theoretically possible

Invariably, you end up twisting facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts
Adler's midget is the key to this
Holmes pulls out a ' , screws it into his eye, and flips Reordon's watch open
He examines the lid
Hmm
scratches around the keyhole, what does that tell you
The owner was most likely a drunk
Each time he wound the watch his hand would slip, hence the scratches
Very good, Watson
You've developed considerable powers of your own
Watson looks quite chuffed
Let's see now, there are several sets of initials scored into the lid
Pawnbroker's marks
Excellent
Watson looks extremely pleased with himself until they turn a corner into a street where His face falls
The most recent is
Watson shakes his head

approaches Watson as he turns to leave
Reckon your future, sir
Perhaps we do need a little help from the beyond
No, thank you
She grabs his hand anyway
You need to hear what  have to tell you
Watson is so taken aback by the urgency and gravity of her tone that he doesn't pull away

And you know it yourself, Watson
That is precisely the reason you can't find a suitable ring
You're terrified of a life without the thrill of the macabre, as well you should be
Holmes swallows the last of his cod and casts the wrapping aside, pleased with himself
Do you still have my cut from the fight
Holmes digs into a pocket, produces a wad of coins
Why, do you -- Watson snatches the money, storms into Madison and Haig
Holmes is confused until he spots a sign in the window: "Large selection of engagement rings for every wallet
" Holmes starts to look a bit nervous
As he follows Watson, he is intercepted by the Palm Reader who grabs his arm
seen something in his hand
Darkness and great pain
Mortal peril
Warn your friend, he's not safe
Even Holmes is taken aback by this

Watson lights a lamp which reveals details of an interior that stops them both in their tracks: From floor to ceiling, every available inch is covered in writing, biblical Latin and Hebrew
Scrawled-on paper and pages are tacked to walls and carved into the plaster, crucifixes punctuate the yards of text and collage, strange pagan charms hang from the ceiling

Some of it gives off a distinctly electrical hum
Ungodly fragments of limbs and matter float in jars

An experiment generating a massive stench, a seething cloud of flies

Watson presses the chemical-soaked paper onto the burnt paper
Why would she hire you to find him, if she planned to do the job herself
Maybe it's not the man she's after, but something else
Something he was working on
Ferrocyanide
Sucks the iron right out of the ink
Long as it's not too burnt
Watson keeps rubbing the paper together, puts it by the lantern
Slowly, faint words  on the blank page
Ghostly chemistry
Watson sees the crest is Blackwood's

Holmes turns and comes face-to-face with a dangerous- looking man who has a few conspicuous  on his face
Ah, Mr
Brownlee
The fifteenth most dangerous man in London
Watson snaps at the man
Who could forget that face told you, a little nitrate of silver and the warts will be gone in two weeks
Now, if you'll excuse us
Brownlee takes a swing at Watson
Holmes checks him and drops Brownlee without missing a beat

Gladstone's my dog as well
It's in the interest of science
What  do take issue with is your ruthless campaign to sabotage my relationship with Mary
Watson,  completely understand now
You're overtired and feeling a bit sensitive
Watson now turns away, completely irritated at Holmes' lack of understanding
What you need is a rest
You and could go out to the countryside
My brother Mycroft has a small estate near Chichester
It has marvelous grounds and a beautiful folly
We could throw a lamb on the spit
Watson shakes his head in disbelief
If  were going to the country, would be going with my future wife -- Certainly
We should have her along
Let's get Gladstone out of the house as well
No, Holmes
Not you
Me and her
You're not -- Invited
Now you're not making any sense, Watson
Why would not be invited to my own brother's country home

You are this

He touches his own heart

John Watson
You made bail

Holmes looks confused
He steps forward
But the Guard shakes his head
Just Watson
As he slides open the bars, they see

Watson stands for a beat between Holmes and Mary
He must make a decision
And he does -- -- he leaves
Holmes watches him walk out, then locks eyes with Mary
She gives him a polite nod, turns, heads off with Watson

The mob surrounds Holmes
He's never looked more alone

Lestrade -- your usual impeccable timing
You know, in another life, you'd have made an excellent criminal
And you, sir, an excellent policeman

-                                        69 Holmes and Lestrade march along

Holmes shrugs
: 72
72 The hood is pulled off
Holmes takes in the scene, eyes flicking around the room
He's in a grand office where a man in his late 60s, , rises from a pile of papers
Mr
Holmes, apologies for summoning you like this
'm sure it's quite a mystery as to where you are, and who  am
As to where  am --  was, admittedly, lost for a moment between Charing Cross and Holborn
But  was saved by the bread shop on Saffron Hill, the only bakers to use a certain French glaze on their loaves
After that, the carriage forked left, then right, a bump over the Fleet conduit -- need  go on
Somewhat stunned, Sir Thomas shakes his head
As to who you are -- that took every ounce of my not- inconsiderable experience and skill
the letters on your desk are addressed to Sir Thomas Rotheram, Lord Chief Justice
That would be your official title
Who you realy are is another matter entirely
Sir Thomas is not in the mood for this -- but Holmes is on a roll

72   :                                                    72 Judging by the sacred Ox on your ring, you're also the secret head of the Temple of the Four Orders -- in whose headquarters we now stand, on the northwest corner of St
James Square
(beat) And as to the mystery -- the mystery is why you bothered to blindfold me in the first place
Yes, well, it's standard procedure,  suppose
Holmes shakes his head; what a massive lack of judgement on their part

Holmes acknowledges them -- barely -- as they enter
He isn't impressed by rank

Yes
They're almost interesting
Be as skeptical as you like -- but our secret systems have steered the world towards the greater good for centuries
The danger is that they can also be exploited for more nefarious purposes
What some call the dark arts, or practical magic
Holmes looks around the room, sees  on the walls with ancient symbols, variations of the
We know you're are a rationalist
We don't ask you to share our faith, only our fears
Fear is the more infectious condition

Stunned, the men consult silently, come to some sort of conclusion
They turn back to Holmes
Sir Thomas seems especially shaken
Very few people are privy to that information, and we want to keep it that way
Sir Thomas opens a bureau, digs for something
He was conceived during one of our rituals
His mother wasn't my wife, but she shared our beliefs
She was a powerful practitioner
Though not enough to survive giving birth to him
Holmes is appalled and shows it
We were young
It was before we fully understood the powers we were dealing with
Evidently
Death followed him wherever he went, from his birth to arms he made and sold
What family he had tended to
not survive
No one could prove anything of course, but we all knew -- Sir Thomas hands Holmes a
photograph from the 1860s
It's chilling: a death scene, a  covered by a sheet

The present and future are worse
We've done our best to stop him ourselves, but it's not enough
His power grows daily and exponentially
His resurrection is evidence of that
What he does next will be far more dangerous -- -- he's going to raise a force that will alter the very course of our world
We need you to find him and stop him before he does
We'll give you any assistance we can
As Home Secretary,  have considerable influence over the police
(beat) Name your price
Holmes looks at Coward with scathing disdain
One of the great benefits of my work is that  can pick and choose my clients
'll get him, but not for you
Holmes stalks out -- stops at the door, turns, fixes Sir Thomas with a very bleak gaze
have one last question, Sir Thomas
What is it
Holmes holds up the tintype
If the rest of his family's dead, why are you still alive
Holmes tosses the tintype onto a table, leaves
73                                                              73 60

'   -                                75 Irene enters wearing a stunning evening dress
She pauses glancing briefly around the room before sitting at a mirrored dressing table
There's a decanter on the table next to her from which she pours herself a glass of wine
Then she begins removing an impressive assortment of hidden on her person: she pulls a stiletto from her garter, a Derringer from her waistband (which she puts down next to the wine glass)
She pulls long thin needles from her hair, lets her hair down
As she continues
Holmes watching her from a shadowy corner
He looks on silently until: If you're going to watch me take my clothes off, Sherlock, the least you can do is help me with the buttons
: To watch a lady undress without her permission is a criminal offense, Sherlock, and could get you into a lot of trouble
They both eye the Derringer on the table
So why don't you come over here and help me instead
Holmes approaches her somewhat tentatively and reaches for the top button on the back of her dress
That's better
You can stop looking for Reardon

Irene is momentarily taken aback then recovers
Wonderful
Case closed then
Your services are no longer required
Unbuttoning done, Holmes steps out to confront Irene
can't help wondering if your employer will be as content with these results
You were uncharacteristically ill at ease in his presence
Your hand was trembling, your gaze was averted
couldn't see his face, but spotted chalk on his lapel professor perhaps
Irene gets up, walks behind a
(behind screen) The eye patch was a nice touch
But 've never known a professor to carry a gun, and on such a clever contraption
(
) Let's not argue
We're not
Irene steps out, now wearing an array of Victorian undergarments
Unfairly gorgeous
The huge still around her neck
She moves back to the dressing table
Holmes won't look at her, refusing to get turned on
Tell me who you're working for and what he's after
That's nobody's business but my own

You see, we are arguing
Holmes gets closer and closer to Irene as he presses his case vehemently
When a man you ask me to find ends up dead in the coffin of the most notorious murderer since Jack the Ripper and that murderer manages to return from the dead, not only is it my business, it's the business of Scotland Yard and the highest levels of the British government
They will certainly consider your reticence to be an obstruction of justice
Which in relation to a crime of this magnitude would certainly mean prison time
This wine is excellent
You should really try some
Holmes notices her Derringer on the table next to the wine bottle
So what's it to be
Do we really have to decide now
Irene reaches for the wine
You're in over your head this time, Irene
Irene snatches up her gun
Holmes grabs her arm
tears into his shoe, missing his toe
Holmes snatches away the smoking Derringer
Irene kisses him, hard and angry at first, becoming something else
Another of the weapons in her arsenal, and the one that disarms Holmes
The kiss leads them to the bed

Irene pulls him down to it
He doesn't resist
Holmes' eyes flare with surprise
Much better
Irene has handcuffed him to the bed frame
This is the only way it could ever work between us, Sherlock -- one in shackles, the other with the key
She gets off him
While he struggles on the bed, Irene walks casually across the room
She starts putting on '
She's in charge now
've  been in over my head
How can you live like this -- always a fugitive
She approaches, now dressed as a man, straddles him
But free
And on my own terms
Just like you -- well, not you at this exact moment -- () 63

-- but generally speaking
Holmes has no retort
Irene takes the scarf off his neck, moves to the doorway
If anyone asks, please let them know that Mr
'Neil didn't have time to check out

Thomas blinks and sees that  now sits in the corner of the bathroom, lit in a sinister fashion
Sir Thomas' eyes widen, the muscles stand out in his neck as he fights paralysis
He slides back down, slowly
You can't fight it
It comes from a power greater than yours
You can only surrender
The water flows over Sir Thomas, as Blackwood steps closer and takes the sacred  from his rigid finger
've been imagining this moment for a long time
The water closes over his face
Sir Thomas stares up at Blackwood, who watches him drown, slowly and surely
must admit, it's better than thought it would be

Clothes in total disarray

Don't take this the wrong way, but might  borrow your hand

The inspector's been over to Baker Street himself this morning
The coach stops

As Constable Clark continues in, Holmes swivels away -- We've checked everything
No sign of a break-in
The Butler didn't hear anything
The body was in the tub, eyes wide open -- -- so that Const
Clark ends up talking to thin air
(realizing Holmes isn't there) -- only his ring was missing
He turns, puzzled, looking for Holmes, finds him right back at the doorway, in full virtuoso detective mode
Right now, right here is where Holmes is at his very best -- this is, in fact, why he exists
Holmes is satisfied by what he sees or finds, continues into the bathroom, where a   stands over the tub and Sir Thomas' body (covered with a blanket)
The tub has been drained
The kind of crime scene violation that Holmes cannot get them to stop doing

78C   :                                                78C Why did you drain the water
Out of common decency
(incensed) Crime is common, logic is rare
The decent thing to do is catch the killer, not provide comfort to the corpse
Neither the officer nor Clark have a response
Holmes swivels, sees a     on the table next to the chair Blackwood sat in, leans over, scoops it up, opens it, sniffs it
Hmm
Holmes thrusts the open jar under the Officer's nose
What is that
(smelling) Uhhhh
jasmine
Superb
suspect this comes from a larger cannister
It'll either be in the pantry, high up where it's warm and dry, or in a linen closet with a vent
And, Constable, you could check the ground under the rear windows for any footprints not your own
Both cops hesitate -- Holmes is not their boss
Data, data, data
cannot make bricks without clay
The cops hurry away
Now Holmes can really get down to work
This may mean he gets on his belly for a floor's- eye-view, it may mean he looks down from a window sill
Sometimes he hums or sings to himself
Holmes is happy
He glances around the room, sees the chair where Blackwood was perched, sits in it himself

Since this room is no longer in use, do you mind if  employ it
Be my guest
Bring him in, boys

They unzip the bag, revealing the dead body of the thug from Reordon's lodging

Holmes grabs various instruments and other items from Watson's newly-packed boxes
Frustrated, Watson snatches them back as quickly as Holmes takes them out

Plenty of it, layer on layer
Holmes scrapes at the layers of blood with his knife, examines it
Though none of it human
Watson slows down slightly
He keeps packing, trying to resist the mystery, but it's not easy
butcher perhaps
What else
Holmes cuts a lock of the man's hair, ignites it, studies the color of the flame carefully
Watson wrinkles his nose at the smell
Hm -- predominantly yellow flame, but with distinct green bursts
Sulfurous
He spent lots of time around industrial work and very little around a wash basin
Holmes uses a curved nail file to scrape dirt from under the man's fingernails, rubs the evidence between his fingers like a connoisseur
Coal
river silt
Watson slows down further, struggling
That plus the river silt and industrial slag on his trousers puts him squarely in
hanging beat
And Watson finally cracks, blurting out: Nine Elms
Well done
Now, you didn't happen to pack the Lord's Register of members' interests, did you
Watson pulls it out of a box

As Watson flips through it, Holmes plucks a few chords on his violin, thinking
Watson finds the page

Everything all right, Captain Tanner
Captain Tanner has few teeth and a large white beard
Just a little leak, nothing to worry about
Watson is busy with a bucket clearing the boat of a very serious leak
He's soaked, and furious
Not a great one for the water, are you, doctor
Army type, aren't you
You wouldn't have lasted long in the Navy
Watson glares
Holmes scans the banks with a telescope
He sees a jetty with a few shadows shifting on it
The engine shudders off, the boat drifts
Tanner whispers: That's as far as we can go

He simply walks up to the door and whacks the larger man in the face with the gun -- before dispatching the other with a backhand pistol-whip

On the high walls, a huge number has been scrawled:     118

Holmes shakes his head, his eyes narrow, ticking
It's chapter and verse
Revelation 1:18

' Another voice completes the passage, echoing from above: (
) `And behold,  am alive forevermore, and have the keys of hell and of death

Holmes starts climbing up towards Blackwood

You led your little lamb straight to slaughter

He heaves himself up to the conveyor, where Irene is being pulled down the assembly line towards the flames

It's going to take two actions to free her

Watson sees a  ( ,

Watson rips down the splatter cloth, sprints to Holmes and Irene, tosses the cloth across the conveyor belt to Holmes -- -- who wraps them up in the thick cloth just before the flames hit them

Watson watches anxiously as the scorched cloth drops away, revealing that Holmes and Irene made it -- just
Relieved, Watson heads for the lever until "Oh Shit

Decision time for Watson -- help Holmes and Irene, or try the lever
He goes for the lever, reaches it, pushes it all the way over -- -- and the belt speeds up with a jerk
Watson hauls back on the lever, gets the belt back to the original speed, looks around for another possible off switch
Just as they reach the scalding tank, Holmes jumps off the belt (still opposite side to Watson), grabs Irene's legs and pulls her horizontal just before she's dragged into the boiling water

Then he pours a ring of salt around that circle

He plucks it, he strums it, he makes strange atonal sounds, as he he's laid out on the floor
Flashes to various images of the sphinx that he's observed over the course of the investigation
He stands up and draws a sphinx in charcoal on the floor
Then he moves to the ox bone -- a flash of Sir Thomas' ring with the Ox crest
He draws an ox in charcoal
Next to the ox bone Holmes writes -- Sir Thomas -- ring
Next, he moves to the feather -- a flash to an Eagle in flight -- he quickly sketches an eagle
Then to an American flag, then to Standish with his eagle-topped cane
Next to the feather he writes America
Then he moves to the hair
He draws a man's face
Flash to Reordon's red hair
Next to it Holmes writes Man
Then he moves to a Lion fang
He sketches out a lion -- he thinks --  no flashes
Next to it he writes a big question mark
Where
Who
Holmes returns to his violin
Staring at the Lion fang as if willing the flashes to come

-                                    102 Holmes is excited, electric
Now that you're sitting comfortably,  shall begin
My initial approach was far too narrow
When Blackwood invited me to Pentonville prison, he suggested  widen my gaze and, at minimum,  have done just that
In fact,  may well have reconciled thousands of years of theological disparity
But that's for another time
Blackwood's method is based on a ritualistic mystical system that has been employed by The Temple of the Four Orders for centuries
To fully understand this system, to get inside it,  re-enacted the ceremony we interrupted in the crypt
with a few enhancements of my own
At minimum
Watson and Irene shoot Holmes knowing looks
My journey took me somewhat further down the rabbit hole than had intended
Yes, your little white tail got rather dirty
But  have emerged enlightened
The fraternity who silently control the Empire, share the belief with the Kings, Pharoahs, and Emperors of old that the Sphinx was a door to another dimension, a gateway to immeasurable power -- He tosses Watson the pages from Sir Thomas
It is made up of four parts: The Ox, the Lion, the Eagle, and Man -- () 90A
102   :                                                 102 He points out the individual parts of the Sphinx, covering other parts with his hand
We see the Ox body, Lion paws, Eagle wings, Man's face
In Sir Thomas' secret chamber found the bone of an ox, the tooth of a lion, the feather of an eagle, the hair of a man
Map
Watson throws the map down on the floor, really flying now
Now, it is a widely held belief that within the architecture of the great cities are coded references to this system
He runs his finger over the map tracing the shape of a cross
Then he picks up the charcoal and (following the map) draws a serpentine curve of the River Thames straight through the middle of the cross that he drew on the floor
Since he rose from the grave, Blackwood has killed three men
Each murder was committed at a location that has a direct connection with the Temple, therefore the System
(beat) Reordon, the ginger midget, represents Man
We found his body here
He points to a spot on the map south of the Thames
It corresponds to the point on the cross that Holmes drew that has the hair (6 o'clock)
Then Sir Thomas, Master of the Temple, wore the ox ring
he died here
Again the spot Holmes points is directly north of the river and corresponds to the point on the cross that has the ox bone (12 o'clock)
() 90B
102   : (2)                                              102 Standish was Ambassador to America, where the Eagle has been the national emblem for over a hundred years -- and not by coincidence
Holmes points to the map
The headquarters of Temple of the Four Orders where he died is here
He points to corresponding points on the map and on the cross
Man, Ox, Eagle
He connects the dots on the map
They form three points of a cross
And last on the list:    the Lion
Holmes scribbles on a piece of paper
Watson and Irene step closer looking at the lion's fang and then the map
Correspondingly, the map will tell us the location of Blackwood's final act
Right here
Their eyes widen as they realize what they're seeing
Parliament
What is the meaning of this circle
Irene indicates the fifth circle Holmes has drawn -- the point at which the other four come together
They look to where it would correspond to on the map -- right in the middle of the river
It is the fifth element -- the ethereal
That which can't yet be known

They hear doors slamming outside, boots echoing
Irene looks out the window, sees   flooding the pub
Police
Holmes folds up his piece of paper, hands it to Watson
He quickly moves to a hatch in the floor
Flings it open
Ladies first
Irene jumps down
Watson is about to follow her down
Follow these plans
Watson goes down
It looks as though Holmes is about to join them when Lestrade and his men burst into the room
Holmes kicks the hatch closed and steps towards Lestrade
102A                                                               102A - Holmes races down the hall toward the back door, but the door  inward
Police fill the hall
Holmes looks back, where more police block his path
He simply raises his arms, and they drag him away

- - ()                   103 Holmes sits battered, cuffed and bruised, though we can see from his face that his spirits are unaffected by his physical state
Tough-looking cops sit either side of him, Lestrade sits opposite, shaking his head -- he can't believe it's come to this
He looks at Holmes

Crowds are gathering outside, hawkers and tourists, plenty of flags and enthusiasm
Holmes sees the hands of  , climbing toward noon
105
105 The place is a hive of activity, preparing for pomp and circumstance, at its ceremonial best
All of which is in stark contrast to the battered figure of Holmes, who is marched through a series of doors and checkpoints along the corridors of power by an angry- looking Lestrade
They come to a door
Lestrade knocks
106
-  '                      106 The door is opened by Lord Coward, who's halfway through putting on his official robes, and caught off guard by the sight of Holmes cuffed (hands behind him) and flanked by Lestrade and men
Lestrade
Begging your pardon, m'lord, know it's unorthodox, but Mr
Holmes has been making serious accusations about you and the order, sir
Lestrade pulls his lapel, revealing a temple of four orders pin
Oh, that solves the great mystery as to how you became inspector
Lestrade punches Holmes
have five minutes before my next engagement, why don't you regale me with your stories of conspiracies
Thank you, Lestrade, if you could wait outside
Lestrade leaves and shuts the door
() 93
106   :                                                  106 'm curious, Coward, did you assist Blackwood in all the murders or just the one prevented
Very distinctive those hand-made shoes of yours, but the price of quality is the unique imprint they leave
Coward walks towards his desk at one end of the room
Holmes goes to warm himself by the fire at the other end
Nonetheless,  confess to being completely out-matched
could deduce very little from my investigation
Coward turns away for a moment -- Holmes subtly kicks a log from the fire, it starts to smolder and fill the room with smoke
Fortunately, there is nothing more stimulating than a case where everything goes against you
How many members of parliament do you intend to murder at noon today
(beat) Man, ox, eagle, lion -- the lion is parliament, isn't it
Lord Coward slows, looks at Holmes in some astonishment
Very clever
But it's not murder, Mr
Holmes
It's mercy
We are giving the weak masses a strong shepherd
Don't you see it's for their own good
Smoke fills the room so that Holmes is concealed
Coward pulls a gun from the desk and moves to the window
He opens it to try and clear the smoke
No, but  don't care much what you think
simply wanted to know the location of Blackwood's final ceremony, and now you have given it to me
have told you nothing

Holmes sitting in a chair behind Coward
Well there's no time to waste then, is there
Coward spins around and shoots at Holmes
He misses
Holmes runs towards the open window as Coward fires another shot
With a single bound, Holmes leaps out of the window Coward opened
Coward runs to the window and sees Holmes  toward the river Thames,  down down down to -- 107                                                                107 - Holmes dives into the river handcuffed

He grabs it with his hands
And
it pulls him closer to the rickety boat of Captain Tanner
Watson stands on the rear deck, pulling Holmes in on the rope
Irene is also present
When Holmes is level, Watson leans over and clips off his cuffs using bolt cutters
Clearly the whole escape has been planned
Holmes is pulled up into the boat
(to Watson) told you he'd be coming out the top window, soldier boy
No way he'd be coming over the terrace
Watson hands over the change from the engagement ring
Tanner takes it happily
How was Lestrade
Performed his role perfectly little too perfectly, come to think of it
Watson has the  that Holmes gave him in the attic
Well, your instructions were fairly precise
about everything except the window
Tanner smiles, still pleased with himself
Where to, Sherlock
Holmes points to a dark recess in the embankment
Port side, Captain Tanner, into the sewers
Tanner turns the boat
Irene looks out, her eyes narrow
Watson, did you bring my clothes
Watson hands over a pile of clothes and Holmes'
Holmes opens the drum, checks the load, grimaces, pockets it
He's never going to like guns

He takes a shot
Starting early, aren't we
He offers the flask to her
Trust me, have a drink
She can see this is more than a social invitation, she takes a hit, pulls a face
Holmes nods towards Watson, Irene passes him the bottle
He drinks, grimaces, hands it on to Tanner, who swallows it without flinching, wipes his mouth, smiles
The boat is almost at the sewers
What are we doing in the sewers
Patience, Doctor
am about to show you
As they head toward the sewers, Holmes glances up toward Big Ben, the time moving toward noon

The entire government is here
We see familiar faces from the Temple of Four Orders, heading into this epic building

Far as  can go
Holmes and Watson leap off the boat into the mouth of the sewer
Irene follows

) They move through the shadowy sewer tunnels, working their way around corners and through junctions back under the Houses of Parliament

Irene and Watson flank him, standing in shadows
They look down a long tunnel to: The area where Coward and Blackwood were seen in the flashback ceremony with the sword
But now: Blackwood's  patrol the area
In the center, the pentagram remains
But there is something sitting in it, a futuristic device: Behold, Blackwood's magic
black glass cylinder is housed in a metal cradle with electrodes on either side
It sits below a shattered ceiling, bricks dismantled, exposing a
Holmes looks back at Watson and Irene
Quiet: chemical weapon
The first of its kind
Cyanide, to be precise
You can tell that from here
No
can tell it from here
He pulls something out of his pocket:    the
snipped this off a rather recumbent rat at the slaughterhouse
Note the blue discoloration, the faint smell of bitter almonds
Tell-tale signs of cyanide
He points at the device and the exposed shaft over it
That shaft leads directly to Parliament
When activated, those electrodes on either side will send a charge converting the cyanide powder into a gas
All of the people inside that building -- Will be dead at the strike of noon

Seven minutes to twelve
They nod
Shoulder-to-shoulder, they move down the tunnel, faster and faster
Irene trails them closely
Watson slides his sword stick into a loop on his belt
It's there when he needs it, out of the way otherwise
They draw their guns
They burst into the area, completely surprising the three thugs
Watson pistol-whips the nearest
Holmes front-kicks the next
The third thug looks down the barrels of both their guns before he has a chance to fight or flee

Holmes hands Watson his gun
Gun in each hand, Watson herds the three thugs away from the device
Over there
Sullen, but without much resistance, they move away (two dragging the pistol-whipped one, who is out)
Watson turns so that he can watch the action at the device -- -- which puts his back to another tunnel

Irene recoils, sees something past Holmes -- -- Where        , both hands held high to grab the guns and smash Watson
Before Irene can alert him, Watson's wrists are crushed from behind
Dredger jerks Watson's arms sideways, sending both guns spinning away -- -- Holmes's gun splashes into the sewer
Dredger spins Watson around, head-butts him with a teeth- rattling blow, flings Watson away like a discarded paper cup
Now unguarded, the two conscious thugs charge Holmes and Irene

Dredger charges towards the device and Irene
Holmes flies into him feet-first, deflecting him for a moment
It is now clear that Dredger's sole purpose is to protect the device
Irene sits at the device, trying to figure out how to defuse it
The second chime resounds
Dredger grabs Holmes, thrusts him upwards against the sewer roof, simultaneously strangling him and hammering him against the bricks hard enough to dislodge some
Holmes lashes out with his feet at Dredger -- who doesn't even bother to block anything
Holmes' kicks lose steam as he loses air

Dredger drops Holmes, staggers back holding his bleeding ears
Holmes heads back to Irene
Watson draws the sword from his sword stick
Deadly enough, but not very big
You owe me for the ring
Dredger backs off, as if scared of the sword -- but only until he can reach up and pull Blackwood's ceremonial sword down off a brick ledge
This is going to be more uneven than usual
As Watson parries Dredger's massive slashes and thrusts all around them, only just keeping Dredger at bay -- -- Holmes sees that the cylinder is welded onto the cradle by two
His eyes narrow, a plan forming
Give me your gun
The bullets, need the bullets
The clock is ticking down
Irene pops open her Derringer, slides the bullets into Holmes' hand
He chops open the bullet casings with his knife, pouring the gunpowder into -- -- the bowl of his pipe
Watson ducks a whooshing cut, lunges with his little sword, sticks it into the meat of Dredger's bicep
Dredger grunts angrily, flexes his bicep, rips the sword out of Watson's grasp with his muscle, then he pulls it out, snaps the blade against the wall like a twig, and moves in to cut Watson in two with the ceremonial sword from head to toe
Watson dives desperately, gets a haircut from the sword -- () 102

115 Blackwood has lit four small red candles, placed them on the balustrade in front of him
He calmly intones a familiar chant
Lords are on their feet
Guards are banging outside the doors, but the doors are locked
Members of the Temple of Four Orders stand in front of anyone going to open them

Shaped charge, Victorian-style
We need a light, a match -- Irene's eyes narrow, seeing something in the cradle:   her She rolls up a sleeve
Got it
Which is when a blood-maddened Dredger thunders into them both, arms wide, driving Holmes and Irene away from the device -- -- hammering them into the wall with a mighty thud
Then he braces his massive feet, angles his huge legs and pushes, squeezes them against the wall like a human vice
That's the extent of Dredger's plan, and it will work for long enough because -- (breath crushing out of her) Three

Bad news

With his face still pressed to the stones: 'm pretty sure  heard the last chime
Holmes looks down at his friend, relieved
Yes, we made it
Just
Watson rolls over, sits up
He's done, had enough
Come on, you've got to admit, you're going to miss this
Which part
The stench of the sewers or the broken bones
(beat) My ankle's done
Watson looks around
Where's Irene
Holmes turns, looks
The cylinders are gone, and so is Irene
His face darkens
He misread her yet again
Holmes, 'm sorry
Holmes sees Irene's lithe shadow moving fast into a maze of tunnels
He motions to the disabled device
Make sure Lestrade keeps it intact
Watson nods
He watches Holmes sprint into the darkness, face grim
118A                                                                118A - Blackwood flashes downward through the ornate official understory of the Houses, heads for a staircase spiralling even further down
106
118B
-                                    118B Irene hears Holmes' angry footsteps behind her, turns, sees a flash of movement through the labyrinth of tunnels and columns
She picks up speed
: Blackwood enters the maze of tunnels, hears, then sees Irene sprint across the maze, about 500 yards away
Then Holmes
Blackwood follows them
Sees something on the ground ahead -- pauses
It's '  , flung there from the previous action with Dredger
Blackwood scoops it up
118C                                                              118C - Panting, Irene runs along a tunnel that steps lower -- -- and pinches tighter
large-diameter water pipe angles down the tunnel wall, forcing Irene to turn sideways to continue
The sound of Holmes' footsteps drives her forward
And then the tunnel ends
The water pipe breaks off jaggedly in mid-air, next to Irene's head
The continuation of the pipe passes through solid brick at the end of the tunnel -- a dark, claustrophobic gamble
Irene hesitates for a moment, then slithers into the pipe, into the unknown
118D
-                                             118D The pipe angles down, damp, horrible
For a long moment it is pitch black, pinched down
Irene's quick, anxious breath the only point of reference
This is as tight, subterranean, dark and nightmarishly claustrophobic as it gets
Then, almost imperceptibly, light
We can make out Irene's determined profile
Light increases, and so does Irene's rate of movement
107
118E
-                                            118E The pipe emerges from the brick wall in what looks to be the cellar of a building
Stonework fairly new
Dim daylight from an unseen opening shows a fixed ladder heading upwards
Irene accelerates for it
118F
-                                              118F Holmes grimaces, enters the pipe, shimmies  us
An even tighter fit for him
118G
-    -                            118G Irene -- climbing with one hand, cylinders in the other -- reaches an iron grate, has to use all her strength to shoulder it aside
As fit and athletic as she is, this is a grind
118H                                                               118H - Irene emerges at the base of a dark, hollow building full of construction equipment, and sees, yes -- -- more stairs, upward
The only ready way out
Gritting her teeth, chest heaving, Irene charges the stairs -- 118I
-                                            118I -- just as Holmes pops out of the pipe, vaults onto the fixed ladder and swarms up it
Anger lends him energy
118J
-                                   118J : Irene finally makes it to a floor in the building that is flooded with sky-bright daylight
She surges for light -- a brick-framed window -- and -- : 108
118K
-   -   -         118K at the top of
She's climbed up the inside of the Tower
She's 250 feet above the Thames
We've gone straight from maximum claustrophobia to maximum knee-buckling exposure
and   a massive,  360- that starts with Irene at the (unfinished) window -- -- then shows the skeletal bridge spanned tenuously with scaffolding -- -- then the glory of London, the center of the world, laid out for us in breathtaking, spectacular beauty -- -- and returns to Irene as, recovered somewhat -- she darts onto the walkway scaffolding that crosses above the Thames
119-119G                                                  119-119G 119H
-  -                              119H Irene works her way through the construction debris on the bridge
She makes it to the end, no further to go
Woman
Sherlock appears behind her, winded
It's bad manners to leave without at least saying `goodbye
' Irene turns
Goodbye
He start to move towards her
She whips out her gun
You of all people know  will pull this trigger
They circle around each other
() 109
119H   :                                                 119H 'd tell you 'm sorry, that wish things could be different but you wouldn't believe me anyway
Why hurry off, give it a try
He moves in again
She shoots him in the arm
And in that split second -- Blackwood drops down from behind Irene,  her with '
She drops, stunned
As she falls, Blackwood plucks the cylinder out of her hand, and kicks her gun away
Her gun goes flying off the side of the bridge
But Irene doesn't pause: She swings her legs through the air, trying to take out Blackwood's knees
But he swipes her legs away, and and -- You're better off without her, Holmes
High above:   a  lands

119H   : (2)                                             119H -  - look between them and then it's on
Holmes grabs a short section of wooden batten out of the railing
Flimsy, no match for the sword -- -- which is immediately apparent as Blackwood comes in, slashes, chops six inches off the batten
planned to kill a handful of senile old men to make this empire strong
but now because of you thousands are going to die
Holmes is on the defensive throughout, but, as before, his target is the cylinder first, Blackwood second, self defense third
All  have to do is break this cylinder
The wind will do the rest
And you'll be the first
The two men continue their swordfight: Holmes grabs some rope hanging from the scaffolding above and swings off the bridge
Blackwood steps to the edge with his sword out, awaiting Holmes
Holmes swings towards the blade and then pushes off the bridge once again to avoid it
Holmes swings back onto the bridge a few feet away from Blackwood
He lands, whips off his scarf and twirls it around Blackwood's arm, binding them together
They continue to spar, now bound
Blackwood snarls, mounts a frenzied attack, which Holmes simply tries to survive
The two men finally part, with Holmes cast off towards the end of the bridge
Blackwood smiles
He grabs Holmes' gun (which Blackwood knocked from Irene's hand earlier)
Blackwood fires at Holmes
Holmes quickly ducks
The bullet misses him, but hits a bucket twirling above his head
black liquid (tar) begins to pour out in a circle around him
Holmes turns, as if to flee (not that there's anywhere to go) -- his eyes lock on to something
He looks back to Blackwood
-- Holmes kicks a huge scaffolding plank, which falls -- -- whipping a coil of rope across the floor, hooking Blackwood around his ankle
() 110A
119H   : (3)                                            119H Blackwood is  down the walkway by the weight of the falling plank, pulled toward the edge
Holmes grabs the cylinders as Blackwood passes
Blackwood digs his fingers into a gap, screeching to a painful halt
His fingers are white from strain
Holmes remains cool
There was never any magic
Only conjuring tricks
Above Holmes:   the raven starts  at a rope
The simplest involved paying people off, like the prison guard
Holmes looks over the edge of the walkway
He sees the plank swinging dangerously in the storm
Blackwood strains desperately to hold on

119H   : (5)                                            119H Blackwood struggles to hold on, he loses his grip for a second and is dragged back toward the precipice
Wind whips harder
Holmes doesn't notice: The Raven's rope , starting a slow, subtle
: a bucket drops, hits a row of standing timbers
The timbers start to topple
(: Each time one object strikes another, we hear a faint musical note moving up the same pentatonic scale that Holmes played earlier for his flies
) You hated your father and the other members of the Temple of the Four Orders for what they did to you
How satisfying it must have been to use their own system against them
: We see the slow, inexorable dominoes continue to fall
The last timber falls over the edge, lands on a rope
The rope yanks down a crane, the crane swings, strikes another crane
Cut me loose, Holmes
Blackwood's eyes are full of fear
Holmes thoughtfully looks out at the angry storm, the atmosphere electric and dangerous
Holmes gives the slightest hint of a smile
You better hope that it's nothing more than superstition as you performed all the rituals perfectly
Holmes looks around at the gathering storm
Blackwood can hold on no longer
He screams as he releases his grip and is torn down the walkway at breakneck speed
Quick as a snake, Holmes grabs a workman's ax placed on the side and hurls it at his feet, cutting the rope
Blackwood's imminent death is brought suddenly to a halt
The storm grows in ferocity
Holmes bends down, Blackwood is on his knees, cowed

119H   : (6)                                              119H First, the world will see you for what you are
Then you will hang
properly this time
Blackwood looks up
The crane dislodges a , which misses Holmes by inches as it crashes through the floorboards -- Blackwood smirks
We'll see about that shall we
It's a long journey from here to the rope
Holmes looks up
Blackwood looks up
We'll see about that shall we
The top of the crane crashes down
The wooden infrastructure supporting Blackwood falls away
Sending Blackwood falling into a lattice of below
Blackwood screams as the chains begin to snap off one by one
He falls farther
and farther
and finally -- The last chain ,  around Blackwood's neck, killing him instantly
Blackwood dangles on the rusty chain, hanged like a common man after all, with Tower Bridge as his gibbet
Holmes just stands there, stunned
He looks out to see: the  flying away, a silhouette against the stormy sky
The bird flaps its wings, disappearing into a cloud
His brow furrows
Perhaps there really are some things that cannot be explained
Holmes looks over the side of the bridge, sees: is awkwardly splayed on the lower level
She appears to be dead, possibly a small trickle of blood is coming out of her mouth
Holmes moves down to her
He takes her hand
Oh, Irene
His fingers move to take her pulse

119H   : (7)                                             119H Her eyes pop open
Irene makes a quick move: she tries to  him
But this time, Holmes is ready for it: He reverses the move, cuffing her instead
He takes a seat next to her
They sit there for a beat, an odd lovers' moment looking out over the Thames
It looks like rain
We've still got a moment
bit of a smile and break
You were right, he is a professor

119H   : (8)                                               119H Holmes reaches over to grab the key
Their faces close, near a kiss
Holmes drops the keys down the top of her shirt (just as she dropped them down his pants)
He snatches the  from around her neck, turns and walks away
She smiles, calls out: You'll miss me, Sherlock
Sadly, yes
Holmes walks away, pauses to pick up Watson's sword stick, keeps walking
At the end of the top of the stairs
Holmes hands the Cylinder to one of the policemen
120-122                                                    120-122 122A
-                                      122A Rain falls softly
It'll be a hell of a trick if Blackwood comes back from this one
Thank you, Lestrade
Now you're going to be even more arrogant and insufferable than ever
Then Lestrade cracks a smile
You're welcome, detective
(beat) Is the woman up there
She won't be by the time your boys get there
Holmes keeps moving into the night
The storm curls around him, the rain falling hard
And he sees

We recognize the figure of Holmes can't help but smile
He joins Watson, no words spoken
Holmes holds out Watson's sword stick
Watson takes it
The two of them stand looking out down the Thames

One moment
Watson takes a quick look in one of the boxes
Please make sure this one is put on the desk in the front room
What's in all those notebooks
Nothing really
Just a few scribbles
cases we've worked on over the years
All your adventures
'd love to read them sometime
Watson laughs then pauses for a moment to consider this idea before they enter

- As Watson and Mary climb the stairs, it becomes clear that Mary now wears '  on her finger
Holmes had it made into an engagement ring
still can't believe he's given us that ring
Do you think he's finally come to terms with you leaving
Of course
No question about it -- 123B

He looks dead

Watson and Mary step in but do nothing to help Holmes
Suicide is not in his repetoire, he's far too fond of himself
Watson pokes him
Turns him around
Good afternoon
was trying to deduce the manner in which Blackwood survived his execution
Clearing your good name, as it were
But it had a surprisingly soporific effect and  was carried off in the arms of Morpheus, like a caterpillar in a cocoon
Get on with it, Holmes
Cleverly concealed in the hangman's knot was a hook -- believe my legs have fallen asleep
should probably come down
Shouldn't you help him, John
hate to stop when he's on a roll
Do carry on, Holmes
Watson and Mary walk by
The executioner attached it to a harness, thus allowing the weight to be distributed around the waist and the neck to remain intact
My lord,  can't feel my cheeks
Might we continue this at ground level
How did you manage it, Holmes

123B   : (2)                                            123B managed it with braces, belts and a coat hook
Please, Watson, my tongue is going next
'll be of no use to you at all
Worse things could happen
John
Watson draws his sword
But none of this explains the lack of a pulse
He finally uses his sword stick and slices Holmes down
Holmes tumbles to the ground
There is a toxin refined from the nectar of the rhododendron ponticum
It is quite infamous in the region of Turkey bordering the Black Sea for its ability to induce an apparently mortal paralysis
Enough to mislead a medical mind even as tenacious and well-trained as your own

They are interrupted by a knock on the door
Constable Clark enters
Mr
Holmes
Inspector Lestrade asks that you come with me, right away
What is it this time, Clarky
It's one of our sergeants, sir
He went missing in the sewers, the day you stopped Lord Blackwood
Well, a maintenance man found his body this morning
We believe the sergeant was our first man on the scene
Shot in the head
Were there powder burns on his eyebrows
Clarky nods
Yes
Point blank range
With small caliber bullet
Indeed

They've taken over the case
Piecing it together: 'd wager there's a piece missing
Constable Clarke nods
Holmes pulls his coat on
So you're saying Moriarty was after a part of the machine and not the poison
Watson nods
The wire-free invention was the game all along
Imagine being able to control any device simply by sending a command via radio waves
Adler was just a diversion
Mary looks at Watson who is clearly trying to curb his enthusiasm and interest
The Driver pokes his head in

Watson nods, the Driver exits
Watson turns to Holmes
Well
