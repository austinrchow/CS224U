Both are Army career men with a morning off to pursue their hobbies
We got ocotillo, devil's walking stick--what's this stuff--it's that whattayoucallit--horse-crippler
Mikey bends to scoop something out of the sand, putting it in a canvas bag slung on his hip
This place is a gold mine
Lead mine
sees that Cliff is talking, pulls his headset off
What
It's a lead mine
Right
don't know why 'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head
You finding lots of cactus and shit
It's not just cactus
There's the nopals, the yuccas-- (Puts headset on) Looks like a lot of cactus to me
(Grumbles) Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear
(Troubled) Cliff-- You live in a place, you should know something about it
Explore-- Cliff-- in the f

Don't tell me--Spanish treasure, right

) Was Coronado in the Masons
-- distant cloud of  appears on the horizon underscores that we are in Texas, and we  the as the dust takes form around an The car comes close enough to see it has a County Sheriff's insignia on the side
We see  , the Sheriff, driving
Sam is 40, quietly competent to the point of seeming a bit moody
He sees something up ahead
,   as Sam pulls off the road and we see the sergeants standing in the scrub
--  -- The hand and forearm down to the elbow of the skeleton are visible now
Cliff stands looking at the arm with Sam
is a few yards behind them, playing with his metal detector
Beyond him we see the Sheriff's car parked
was driving back from Apache Wells when they got me on the radio
This was a rifle range way back when
But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction
(Nods) 've got the forensics fella coming down from the Rangers
No way to know how old the body is without some lab work
That ring-- Masons been around a long while
Mikey has come up to them, still sweeping with the metal detector
Treasure hunter
(Apologetic) Old bullets
He uhm-- makes art with them
Sam just nods
Mikey frowns, goes down on one knee and scratches something out of the dirt at their feet-- The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch anything, (To Sam) He can't hear with that rig on-- Mikey
Mikey comes up with something, holds it before them
An encrusted piece of metal-- What've we got here
Sam takes the thing, lays it back down where Mikey found it
'posed to leave everything right where we found it
They're real particular about that
The scene of the crime
No telling yet if there's been a crime
Sam frowns down at the piece of metal as he rubs the face of it
Sam's thumb wipes across the face of the encrusted metal
It is roughly star-shaped
(
) But this country's seen a good number of disagreements over the years
--  -- We look at a beautiful old pull-down map of Texas
(
) We do the best we can here-- teacher in her late 30s,  , steps in front of the map and we  her across the room, carrying a poster --but hey, public education these days is a bit of a battleground
Posters hung on the walls beyond her show luminaries from Texas history-- Sam Houston, Stephen Austin, Juan Seguin new parent,  , stands in the middle of the otherwise empty classroom
He went to school on base when we were in Okinawa
It's all--you know-- kids in the same boat--Army brats
His record shows that he's a good student
'm more worried about the social thing
Are therelike--gangs, or
starts to put the poster up
moves to hold it in place for her
We haven't had any serious violence, if that's what you mean
We've got a pretty lively mix though--you walk into the cafeteria and the Anglo kids are in one section, the Mexican kids in another and the Black kids have a table in the back--thanks-- So Blacks are-- They're the smallest group except for a couple Kickapoo kids
Look, you're obviously a concerned parent
Chet has no history of getting into trouble--'m happy to have him in my class
She steps back to see if the poster, an old photo of Geronimo, looks straight
Another teacher,  sticks her head in the door-- (Uncomfortable) Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay
Okay
He's not here
No
Is he sick
(Mutters) He's going to wish he was dead
--  -- On the door of a deluxe pickup truck is an airbrushed picture of a Pancho Villa-looking vaquero with bandoliers crossing his chest and a gun blazing in each hand
We hear  -- (
) Luis
Give me that Phillips-head back-- small group of teenage Chicano  hang around the truck in the bed, on the hood, leaning against it
placed on top of the cab blasts   out at the neighborhood
Somebody's legs are hanging out the open passenger-side door
The kids suddenly look as a Sheriff's Department car slides into the f
g
Deputy Sheriff, , gets out
Trying to look tough and unworried as we  across the street toward them
Travis's hand reaches out from behind the camera to flick the
, Pilar's 15-year-old son, lies on the front seat installing a compact disc player into the dash slot
He reaches up to the dash, can't find what he wants
Somebody hand me the  player-- damelo pendejos-- He looks up and we  to see Travis leaning in the window, examining the new radio They come a long way from those old 8-track jobs, haven't they
Something wrong
(Waves radio) This is stolen property
Alla you fellas are coming down to the station
--  -- Sweat beads the forehead of a thin, tired-looking recent immigrant, , as he delivers platters of chile rellenos to a booth
plays on a jukebox in the b
g
We on the booth, where  , in his 60s entertains two   -- So Buddy walks up to the porch and there's old Fishbait McHenry, cleanin' the dirt out his toenails with a pocketknife--he was the most hygienic of all the McHenrys-- The breakfast companions are laughing already-- "Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet way of his, "What you know about them tires that went missing from markets
" Fishbait thinks for a minute, then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it, "'mon out, Pooter, they caught us
" (Laughing) Buddy Deeds
He had a way
He known who it was onnacouna the tire tracks in the dirt from the back of the garage to where they loaded up
"Old Fishbait," he says, "never lifted a thing in this world if there was a way he could roll it
" More laughter-- Won't be another like him
That boy of his doesn't come near it
You ask me, he's all hat and no cattle (
) Fellas-- We  to see Sam standing by their booth
No telling how long he's been listening, Fenton is embarrassed
Sam
was just telling a few about your old man
He was a unique individual
Yeah, he was that
We sense a little strain when Sam has to talk about his father-- Big day coming up-- wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living
But he went so unexpected
Better late than never
Korean War hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- Buddy Deeds Memorial -- heard there was a bit of a fuss
Oh, you know, the usual troublemakers
Danny Padilla from the Sentinel, that crowd
Every other damn thing in the country is called after Martin Luther King, they can't let our side have one measly park
King wasn't Mexican, Fenton-- Bad enough all the street names are in Spanish-- They were here first
Then name it after Big Chief Shitinabucket
Whoever that Tonkawa fella was
He had the Mexes beat by centuries
There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben-- --Santiago
Right
But nobody here ever noticed him till they read his name on the national news-- They just wanted it to be one of theirs-- That's not the whole story
The Mexicans that know, that remember, understand what Buddy was for their people
Hell, it was Mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him
Sam looks to the register where Pilar's mother, , whacks rolls of change apart on the counter
She seems to be avoiding looking toward him
That so
She put it even at three to three, so as the Mayor  get to cast the tiebreaker
The older generation won't have any problem with it
They remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part
Tell that one, Hollis-- Hell, everybody heard that story a million times
'd like to hear it
Your version of it
Something about the way Sam says it puts Hollis on guard
Go ahead, Hollis
Hollis is hooked into it now-- The two of us were the only deputies back then me and Buddy--it's what-- '58-- (
) '57, 1 believe-- And the Sheriff at the time was Big Charley Wade
Charley was one of your old-fashioned bribe-or-bullets kind of Sheriffs, he took a healthy bite out of whatever moved through this county
He looks down at the table-- It was in here one night, back  when Jimmy Herrera run the place
Started right here in this booth
We  down to the table, The food has changed
The tortillas are in a straw basket instead of plastic
The jukebox changes to   and the   slightly
hand with a big Masonic ring on one finger appears to lift a tortilla-- underneath it lie three ten-dollar bills
The hand lifts them up and we  to see the face of   , a big, mean redneck with shrewd eyes
It is 1957-- (Grins) This beaner fare doesn't agree with me, but the price sure is right
Wade sits across from his young deputies,   (30s) and   (20s)
chicken-fried steak sits untouched in front of Buddy
Hollis has the anxious look of an errand boy, while Buddy is self-contained and quietly forceful for his age
What's that for
Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives
People breed like chickens
So
roust some muchacho on the street, doesn't have his papers, all he got to say is "Yo trabajo para Jimmy Herrera
" Wade folds the money and stuffs if in his pocket-- You got to keep the wheels greased, son
Sheriff does his job right, everybody makes out
Now this is gonna be one of your pickups, Buddy
First of the month, just like the rent
Get the car, Hollis
Wade and Hollis slide out of the booth to stand
'm not doing it
Hollis stops a few feet away, shocked
Wade just stares down at Buddy
Come again
Buddy looks Wade in the eye, seemingly unafraid
It's your deal
You sweated it out of him, you pick it up
There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy
take care of my boys
That's not the point
You feeling bad for Jimmy
Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side
Those old boys in Ciudad Leon-- 'm not picking it up
You do whatever  say you do or else you put it on the trail, son
The  are all watching now, nervous
Buddy thinks for a moment, not taking his eyes off Wade
How 'bout this--how 'bout you put that shield on this table and  vanish before you end up dead or in jail
Wade rests his hand on his pistol
It is dead silent but for the  on the box
You ever shoot anybody was looking you in the eye
Who said anything about shootin' anybody
Buddy has his gun out under the table
He slowly brings it up and lays it flat on the table, not taking his hand off it or his eyes off Wade
Whole different story; isn't it
You're fired
You're outta the department
There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley
You made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy
You little pissant-- Now or later, Charley
You won't have any trouble finding me
Wade feels the people around him waiting for a reaction
He leans close to Buddy to croak in a hoarse whisper
You're a dead man
He turns and nearly bumps into Hollis
He gives the Deputy a shove
Get the goddamn car
We're going to Roderick's
He watches till the screen door shuts behind them, then holsters his gun and begins to saw at the steak as if nothing had happened
He calls softly-- Muchacho--mas cerveza por favor
He looks up at somebody and we  till we see Sam, still standing over the booth, listening
We are back in 1995-- (
) "Mas cerveza por favor
" (
) That Buddy was a cool breeze
We   to see Hollis and his buddies at the table, eating their lunches as they listen
Charley Wade were known to have put a good number of people in the ground, and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball with him
We made our collection at Roderick's place and that was the last anybody seen hide nor hair of him
He went missing the next day, along with ten thousand dollars in county funds from the safe at the jail
Never heard from him again
Not a peep
Buddy run the man out of town
Buddy Deeds said a thing, he damn well backed it up
Won't be another like him
So he arrested all of Jimmy Herrera's people and sent 'em back to the other side
Hollis sees what Sam is getting at, grins-- Oh--he come to an accommodation
Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning
Right
Look,  know you had some problems with your father, and he and Muriel-- well-- Your mother was a saint
--but Buddy Deeds was my salvation
Sam nods, speaks softly-- Won't be another like him
--  -- (), a very direct, by-the-book Black officer, addresses them
Artillery pieces angle toward the sky behind him-- --it's an honor for me to assume command of this unit, and  look forward to working with all of you
Cliff and Mikey, in uniform now, flank , a Black woman in her early 40s, as they stand in formation-- (
) 'm sure you're all aware of the Army's decision to close this installation under the Reduction in Force plan
That does not mean, however-- We look over the shoulders of assembled  and NCOs toward Del
--that we've been sent here to mark time until we are absorbed by another unit
You may have heard rumors that  run a very tight operation
These rumors are not exaggerated
'  --  -- We are looking through a magnifying glass at an old photo
Buddy's face is slightly distorted by the glass
(
) Sam
got Danny Padilla from the paper for you-- Sam sits at his desk in the Sheriff's office, looking down at the photo-- Tell him 'll catch him later
An old photo of the 1957 Sheriff's Department officers on the courthouse steps
Wade, Hollis, Buddy, a few others, all in uniform
(
) He says he needs to talk to you before the ceremony, Sam
Sam puts a magnifying glass over the photo and bends close to look
Tell him to try me tomorrow
-- of the badge on Wade's chest swims into view
metal star
We hear the secretary getting rid of the caller
(
) He thinks you're trying to duck him
Looking at the photo, troubled-- (Mutters) He's right
'  --  -- We start on a  -- ', then  to see a full parking lot outside the low, neon-lit roadhouse
& blasts from inside
-- , a Black kid around 15, stands nervously at the door building up his courage
He takes a deep breath, plunges in
' We  with Chet, very nervous, as he makes his way through the crowded roadhouse
The customers are all Black, many from the nearby Army post,  and  over the loud
Chet, edgy, is looking for somebody
He sees
'  -- Seen through the crush is  " " , a large man in his early 60s, laughing as he stands behind the bar
He nervously puts his hand under his jacket
gun
He pushes forward to get a better view
'  -- Moving in on him
Otis looks over, sees the boy, frowns-- Reaching under his jacket, he pulls out--a photograph
He looks at it--suddenly there is a  from behind, then , patrons diving for the floor
Chet whirls around and we   to see a young man, , emptying his pistol into , a young soldier, as a young woman, , screams and tries to pull the gun away
With the last shot, Shadow turns and heads for the door, but is tackled and swarmed by angry men,
We  to Athena, kneeling over the bleeding, twitching body of Richie-- Chet backs up, horrified
large hand grasps him on the shoulder from behind
He turns to see Otis standing over him, strangely calm amid the chaos You weren't in here tonight, were you
No sir
(Points) Go out through the back
Chet hurries away
Otis watches him for a moment, then turns to the mess in his club
--  -- An angry woman stands from her auditorium chair-- You're just tearin' everything  down
Tearin' down our heritage, tearin' down the memory of people that fought and died for this land
(
) We fought and died for this land, too
We   to see another standing parent-- We fought the
Army, the Texas Rangers-- (
) Yeah, but you lost, buddy
We   to a man in the rear-- Winners get the bragging rights, that's how it goes
(
) People--people-- We are in the High School auditorium, a hot-and-heavy teachers- and-parents meeting in progress
Pilar sits at the end of a long table facing the agitated parents, taking some heat
, a young, long-haired reporter, sits in the front taking notes, enjoying the show
think it would be best not to put things in terms of winners and losers-- (Points at Pilar) Well, the way she's teachin' it has got everything switched around was on the textbook committee, and her version is not-- We think of the textbook as kind of a guide, not an absolute-- --it is not what we set as the standard
Now you people can believe what you want, but when it comes to teaching our children-- They're our children, too
The men who founded this state have a right to have their story-- The men who founded this state broke from Mexico because they needed slavery to be legal to make a fortune in the cotton business
think that's a bit of an oversimplification-- Are you reporting this meeting or runnin' it, Danny
Just adding a little historical perspective-- , Pilar's teenage daughter, peeks into the room, then moves down the side toward the stage
You may call it history, but  call it propaganda
'm sure they got their own account of the Alamo on the other side, but we're not on the other side, so we're not about to have it taught in our schools
There's no reason to be so threatened by this-- Pilar is trying to stay calm despite her anger
've only been trying to get across some of the complexity of our situation down here--cultures coming together in both negative and positive ways
(
) If you mean like music and food and all,  have no problem with that
We shoot past Pilar toward the parents in their seats steps up to whisper to her
--but when you start changing who did what to who
We're not changing anything, we're presenting a more complete picture
And that's what's got to stop
Pilar looks troubled by what she's heard
She shoots a look toward the others at the table, then slips away with Paloma-- There's enough ignorance in the world without us encouraging it in the classroom-- Now who are you calling ignorant
Folks,  know this is a very emotional issue for some of you, but we do have other business to attend to-- We're not going to get some resolution on this
Weary-- Would you people like to form another committee
from the parents-- '  --  -- Shadow, face bruised, hands cuffed behind him, is pushed in through the door to be booked
hope the sucker does die, man
Mess with me, that's what you get
Sam steps in behind him and meets his Chief Deputy , coming from the other direction
Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape-- (Glances ahead) The shooter local
(Shakes his bead) Down from Houston
think he knew the girl before
Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post
You can get the story from Otis over at the club
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today
Nothin' much
The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it
Catch you later
As Ray steps out, Pilar looking distraught, walks into the station, passing right by Sam without seeing him
Wonders what she's doing there-- '  -- She stands by an unoccupied reception desk, very upset, unable to attract anyone's attention because of the activity around the shooting
She looks tired and a bit scared under the harsh overhead light
(
) Pilar
Pilar looks around
Sam is standing by her
We can tell there is some history between these two
Something wrong
They've got my Amado
Got him here
Somebody called--something about an electronics store
'll see what's going on
He starts away, stops, comes back-- was-- was real sorry about Nando
He was a good fella
We haven't talked since
We haven't talked since high school
Yeah
'll go check on your boy
Pilar watches Sam go-- Travis sits typing away at a word processor as Athena, in tears, gives testimony
--so Richie just didn't say nothin' 'cause he didn't want to get into it, see, and the next thing  know there's shots and Richie is down
It happened so fast-- (
) Excuse me-- We  to see Sam standing over the desk-- We got some boys you run in earlier today
Yeah
pulled the bunch that hangs at Pico Bernal's place
We finally caught them with something
You got a juvenile with 'ern--Amado Cruz
Travis looks at his booking sheets-- Yeah--let's see--the other ones say he wasn't in on the theft, he just knows how to hook things up
We've been trying to contact a parent
Sam walks with Amado, who is trying to look defiant-- They tell me you're good at fixing things
Nothin-- Your father was a hell of a mechanic
Still nothing-- You know, if you figure minimum wage on the time most thieves spend in jail, they could have bought most everything they stole
didn't steal anything
didn't say you did
My name is Sam, by the way
Amado just gives him a look-- ' Sam and  step out into the office, where Pilar stands waiting
He's all yours
Are you okay
don't know what the big deal is
You'll find out when  get you home
Thanks, Sam
No problem
Pilar yanks  outside by his arm
She turns to shoot a look back at Sam, then steps out through the glass door
Watching her go-- Any time
: --  -- We shoot up from a pit in the ground
Three men leap over, landing on the far side and running away from us
Del Payne runs with Cliff and Mikey on a pathway along a security fence, the two sergeants struggling to keep up, occasionally vaulting or scaling some mild obstacle
There's not that much down here, Colonel
Big 's is the only place in the county that our African American soldiers are uhm--that they feel comfortable in
Have we had trouble there before
Since 've been stationed here fistfight now and then-- We had a kid pass out in the men's room
The town isn't much
They didn't come for a vacation
Yes sir
You know how it is, Colonel--first time away from home, dealing with new people-- remember my first hitch-- Substance abuse
Well, yeah, but  went through the Program
haven't had a drink since-- meant on the post
In general
How are you dealing with it
We throw a urine test at them once a month
Random numbers, maybe a hundred people at a time Why don't we make it once a week for a while
No problem, sir
Del notices bow hard they are breathing-- sprint the last quarter mile
You gentlemen don't have to keep up if you don't care to
Appreciate it, sir
Del accelerates and we  with the sergeants, slowing to a near-walk
Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole
(Grins) You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here
-- We hear Hank Williams' gospel song "'ll Have a New Body ('ll Have a New Life)" as we see the gathered bones of the skeleton tagged and photographed and measured, impressions made of the dental work in the skull, photographs of the excavation of the body at various stages marked with red grease pencil, the piece of metal laid in a de-tarnishing dish, the ring put under a microscope
as we  on the piece of metal, a pair of tongs pulling it from the de-tarnishing solution
It is a star-shaped badge, bearing the words "--
" -- &  playing, the regulars starting to show up
Sam makes his way to a table where  , a Texas Ranger, sits with a file of forensic reports
Sam the Man
Hey, Ben
Thanks for coming down
They shake, Sam sits
How's business
Business is booming
Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big 's--Soldier got ventilated
hear they're closing that post down
September '97, that's all she wrote
Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county
Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweatshops
Sam looks at the folder of reports
That the word on our boy
Yeah, this is Skinny
Skinny
We find a body, it's either Skinny or Stinky, depending on how much meat there is on the bones
Nice job
(Opens folder) Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records-- Charley Wade
(Nods) That badge-- --it didn't come out of a cereal box
Yeah
You know the popular version of how he left town
Everybody on the border knows that story
You got a cause of death
Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on
So he could have gone out to the base, hopped the fence, dug down into the dirt on the old rifle range and had a heart attack
Ben smiles, closes the folder-- You uhm--you remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm
Colt Peacemaker
45-- He swore by it
(Ben frowns) What
Just wondering
So is Buddy on your short list
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further
But this is a formerly prominent citizen
You got to investigate
No question about it
What  will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end
You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old
Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail
They sit in awkward silence for a moment
Ben feels bad about it
remember Charley Wade come to my father's hardware store once when was a little boy
'd heard stories how he shot this one, how he shot that one--man winked at me and peed in my pants
(Shakes his head) Winked at me
-- Pilar stands at the blackboard by her outline of 19th century Texas history
Okay, we have the fight against the Spanish with bloody conflict for dozens of years till they're finally defeated in 1821 and Mexican independence is declared
Anglo settlers are invited-- Somebody making a skillful pencil drawing on the corner of a sheet of lined notebook paper
bald, muscular shotputter after releasing the shot, his hand large in the f
g
(
) --to colonize the area and by the time they begin the movement against Santa Anna they outnumber the Mexicans here by four to one
The war between Mexico-- Drawing intently
He takes the notebook and lays his thumb over the corner
(
) and the Anglo forces ends in 1836 with the formation of the Texas Republic
Texas joins the United States as a state where slavery is legal in 1845-- Chet "flips" the corner of the notebook and the series of drawings he's made form a brief cartoon of the shot-putter blowing his cheeks out and heaving the shot right past us
Extremely well-drawn-- (
) after the so-called Mexican war and then secedes to join the Confederacy in 1861
The Confederacy is beaten, and the Reformation period here is marked by range wars and race wars-- Looking out at the class-- --and all this paralleled by constant battles between both the Mexican and Anglo settlers and the various Indian nations in the area
What are we seeing here
Chet
Startled, he hides the notebook under his hands -- Uhm--everybody is killing everybody else
--  -- nasty-looking thing
Only a bass would want to eat this
Hollis leans in to peer at the thing dangling before his face
Hollis sits in the swivel chair of a bass boat tied to a dock at the lake, going through his box of lures
Sam appears on the dock and steps down
always wondered what you Mayors do when you're not cutting ribbons
Sam
Hey podner
You caught me playing hooky-- (Looks across lake) Floating around out here, playin' hell with them bass--play a little cards, play a little golf, drink some beer-- Sounds great
Where do  sign up
haven't been out here for a while
You go by your old house
No
Just as well
The new people just painted it some God-awful color-- We found a body out by the Army base yesterday
Been there for a long time
Hollis squints at a rubber lure, rejects it-- Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie
(Smiles) You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason
Charley
believe he was
Used to go for lodge meetings over to Laredo
What's he got to do with your body
All it was wearing was a big old Masonic ring and a Rio County Sheriffs badge
Hollis reacts
Sam puts a foot on the gunwale of the boat
You don't remember anything else from that last night you saw him, do you
told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's-- Bledso He owned the colored roadhouse before Big -- He still living
No
think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though
(Shakes his bead) You think it's Charley Wade, huh
Forensics people are sure of it
You have any idea who might have put him there
Hollis makes a great show of considering-- Besides my father,  mean
There's no call for that, Sam
Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years
And Buddy was one of them
We got that dedication tomorrow
This is a hell of a time to be draggin' up old business
People have worked this whole big thing up around my father
If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know
Now  understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it
And  understand why you might want to think he could
This is a low blow, but accurate enough to shake Sam
Thanks for your time, Hollis
Hollis holds up a double handful of lures--dozens of rubber and plastic worms and shiners and frogs and spinners-- Look at all this, would you
My tackle, the boat, all to catch a little old fish just minding its business on the bottom of the lake
He gives Sam a look-- Hardly seems worth the effort--does it, Sam
Sam walks away-- --   --  -- Athena stands at attention, trying to keep her composure-- (
) So you knew this young man before
From back in Houston
We both come up on Fifth Street
(
) Did you know he was going to be there last night
If  had  wouldn't have gone in
(
) And you and Private Graves-- We were just dancing-- Cliff leans against a desk, a blackboard covered with radar diagrams behind him
Priscilla sits nearby, both of them focused on Athena
We're not running a dating service here
know that, Sergeant
We were just dancing
There was a bunch of us there
Shadow just come down looking for trouble
It's not our job to get involved in your personal life, but when it interferes with the training here-- 'm sorry, Sergeant Major
There wasn't anything  could do
Shadow gets crazy-- silence as the sergeant lets her stew for a moment
She works up her courage-- Sergeant Major
How is Richie doing
Private Graves
He'll live
He'll be transferred to a military hospital as soon as he's stabilized-- He'll probably be getting a medical discharge-- Out of the Army
He's going to lose a lung
This is not good news for Athena-- Will this go on my record
Cliff considers for a long moment-- If the incident happened the way you say it did, there hasn't been an infraction
Thank you, Sergeant Major
You're dismissed
Thank you, Sergeant Major
Athena steps out of the room
Cliff sits on the desk-- You spoil 'em, Cliff
Hey--she's in a tough situation cut her some slack-- But 'm the one in charge of her sorry ass
She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood
Crossing to the door-- And if she isn't careful she's gonna slide right back into it
--  -- We start on a  of a rocker creaking back and forth on an old wooden porch
, in her 60s, sits on her porch in the old Black section of town, playing with a Gameboy
She has very thick glasses on
Sam walks up to her from his car-- Mrs
Bledsoe
That's me
'm Sheriff Deeds-- Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior
(Smiles) Yeah, that's the story of my life
You ever play one of these
've seen 'em
Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop tell myself 'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here  sit with half the day gone
You mind if  ask a few questions about your husband
Roderick
won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away
He had the club out on the old trail road-- We run that twenty-odd years
Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967
April
So you must remember Sheriff Wade
Not if  can help it
You had to deal with him in running the club
Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all
First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for
He squeezed money out of you
Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see
Roderick used to say, "Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership
" But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime
And my father
Sheriff Buddy was a different story
Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful
That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite
People didn't complain
Not if they was colored or Meskin
Not if they wanted to keep breathin'
Do you remember the last time you saw him
Minnie thinks, puts down the Gameboy-- seen him in our place the last week before he gone missin'
We  in to a close-up of her
&    slowly-- He used to come in whilst we was in full swing, make people nervous
Had him a smile like the Grim Reaper-- : -- The joint is crowded, people drinking, talking, laughing, a few dancing, all trying to avoid locking eyes with Sheriff Wade, who sits with his legs stretched out at a table
Young Hollis sits by him, smiling uncomfortably
Sax-wailing & blasts from the jukebox
, a slick, confident character with straightened hair and a silk shirt on, in his early 20s, stops to talk with a  on his way to bring a tray with a couple beers and glasses over
(
) --just sit back with his hand on that big ol' gun and act the kingfish with everybody
Otis Payne had come to work for us by then, and that boy had him some attitude-- Watching Young Otis with narrowed eyes-- '  -- man puts a slip of paper in Otis's pocket, pats his back
Otis winks to acknowledge the bet, turns, makes eyes at a sitting at the bar, who is eyeing him back
He lays the beers and glasses on the table, starts away
Pour it
,      - Pour it
Expressionless, he starts to pour the beer into Wade's glass
The Sheriff looks up into his face-- know you
Name's Otis
Otis what
Payne
One of Cleroe Payne's boys
Uh-huh
sent your Daddy to the farm once
know that
Why you think that was
Otis feels people watching
He doesn't want to lose face-- Some crop needed pickin' and the man was shorthanded
very insolent answer for the time and place-- As  remember it was because he had a sassy mouth on him
Must run in the family--You wouldn't be runnin' numbers out of this club, now, would you, son
Runnin' numbers illegal
Runnin' numbers without  know about it is both illegal and unhealthy
You remember that
The beer is poured
Otis starts away-- Whoah, son
You're not finished
Pour his
prefer it in the bottle-- Shut up, Hollis
Pour
Otis meets Wade's look now, pours the other beer-- How come you don't took familiar
Been away
Up to Houston
Houston, huh
hear they let you boys run wild up there
No response
Wade deliberately pushes the glass away so beer splashes on the table and drips into Hollis's lap-- Aw--look what you done now
Better get something to wipe it up, son
Half the people in the room are watching now, the other half moving away to relative safety
Otis tries to keep a lid on his temper, looks around the room-- You spilt it, you wipe it up
Wade stands, steely-eyed, and looks at Otis nose to nose-- told you to do something
Are you gonna hop to it, or are we gonna have a problem
Otis is starting to shake, but holds his ground-- Don't want to turn tail in front of your people
understand
He starts to turn away then
brings the butt of his pistol up under Otis's chin, knocking him to the floor woman  and Otis, enraged, grabs the chair he has fallen over, starts to get up--but Wade has the pistol levelled at his face-- Come on, Houston, give it a try
Come to Poppa-- is out on the floor now, hands held out in a gesture of peace, as   watches from behind the bar, petrified-- Don't mind him, Sheriff
Boy's just a bit slow, is all
He don't mean nothin' by it-- That the problem, son
You Slow
Otis, apologize to the Sheriff-- Otis eases the chair down but doesn't say anything-- You got him too scared to peep, Sheriff
Maybe if you put that gun up-- You telling me what to do, Roderick
No, Sheriff, 'm just-- Wade looks around, widens his eyes in mock surprise-- What's this  see
Is that whiskey in them glasses on the Bar
Roderick, 'm gonna have to cite you for a violation of state law-- This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here-- And people better clear out of here
Now
few people start for the exit
Wade swivels and  sends a bullet past Minnie that shatters a crystal decanter behind the bar
People run for the door
Wade squats down to look Otis in the face-- You learn how to act your place, son
This idn't Houston
He stands and we  him toward the bar-- (
) 'Course  was young and full of beans then-- The camera passes Wade and instead of Minnie there stands Otis,  , reminiscing
We are back in '95-- didn't understand the spot  was putting Roderick in
And that was the last time you saw him
We  to see Sam sitting where Wade was headed-- Oh-- think he came in one more time with Hollis and--naw, your Daddy wasn't with them
Made their monthly pickup
Roderick wasn't in so  just kept my mouth good and shut and handed over that envelope
That was the night he disappeared
(Shakes his head) Could of been
That was white people's business
And when my father was Sheriff
What about it
What was your deal with him
Otis smiles, chooses his words carefully-- Buddy was more a part of the big picture--county political machine, chamber of commerce, zoning board if kept those people happy, he was pretty much on my side
(Smiles) Whenever somebody thought--they start up another bar for the black  folks, they'd be--how should  put this
They'd be officially discouraged
He ever accept cash for a favor
Otis smiles, looks away to ponder his response-- don't recall a prisoner ever died in your father's custody
don't recall a man in this town--Black, White, Mexican--who'd hesitate a minute before they'd call on Buddy Deeds to solve a problem
More than that  wouldn't like to say
-- Pilar drives Amado and her daughter Paloma home-- If you had your way  wouldn't have any friends
Oh, come on, Amado-- Just 'cause 'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here-- Leave your sister out of it
You and all of the teachers in this dump--your story's over, so you don't want anybody else to have fun
We see on 's face that he has scored-- You jerk-- 'm not talking to you
You don't have any friends
eases the car down San Jacinto street, seeing something on the street and she's tuning her kids' conversation out-- Who'd want to be friends with that bunch of pachuco wannabes
don't pretend  came over on the Mayflower-- And those stupid girls who hang out with them-- Just shut up
'  -- Sam walks on the sidewalk parallel to them, talking with three other -- (
) Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school she's like desperately in love with Santo Guerra
(
) So
(
) It's pathetic
You can't be desperately in love when you're 14 years old
' Pilar is still looking fixedly out the window-- Not if you have half a brain in your head
Of course you can
What
It doesn't have anything to do with being smart
-- Danny Padilla is arguing with
, a construction company big shot, and  , a Council member in his 40s and Sam, as they walk down the sidewalk of the main street-- What 'm saying is,  don't see the point
You had your chance when the dedication committee was meeting-- 've got new information-- It's ancient goddarn history, Danny-- 1963, they dam up the north branch to make Lake Pescadero
whole little town disappears-- Squatter town-- People had been living in Perdido for over a hundred years
Mexicans and Chicanos are deported, evicted, moved forcibly out of their houses by our local hero, Buddy Deeds, and his department-- There was a bill from the state legislature-- Families were split apart, a whole community was destroyed-- They were trespassing, Danny-- --and who ends up with lakefront property bought for a fraction of the market price
Buddy Deeds, Sheriff of Rio County, and his Chief Deputy, Hollis Pogue
They all look at Sam, who has been listening patiently the whole while
They've reached his office
You finished
Look, 'm not after you, Sam just think people in town ought to know the full story on Buddy Deeds
(Nods) That makes two of us
Sam steps into his office, leaving
shaking his head-- You best be thankful that's the son and not the father
Buddy woulda kicked your ass from here to sundown
-- '  -- We  down a hallway as Celie walks toward us, calling ahead
Chet stands in the middle of the hall behind her
(
) don't see what the big deal is
Go back over, talk to the man, and bury the hatchet, Del-- passes us and Del crosses back in the other direction from behind the camera, carrying boxes of their belongings
We continue our   forward-- Otis Payne was never embarrassed about a thing in his life
Dad-- (
) You were 8 years old when he left-- He didn't leave, he moved three houses down with one of my mother's best friends
Dad--
"Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy
" Del disappears into the bedroom at the end of the hall-- (
) Everybody else's business
And everybody loved Big -- comes back out, empty-handed-- Big  was always there with a  smile or a loan or a free drink
Dad, can  talk to you about track
(
) People change
Not that much
Dad,  talked to the track coach-- thought we already had this out
Next year, if your grades are high enough-- have a  average
How many -average students do you think they take at West Point
(
) We're going to have to see him
No, we don't
Del steps away past us, leaving Chet, defeated-- --  -- We start on Enrique, talking surreptitiously on the pay phone on the way to the kitchen
Sabado por la noche--Is, es el  mas seguero--a cruzar por la  manana y pues tendremos que esperar--[Friday night--Yes, that's the safest--'ll cross in the morning and then we'll have to wait--] Mercedes bustles by, snapping her fingers-- Off the phone, by we've got people waiting
Andale
We  Mercedes back into the kitchen, where she moves through, kibbitzing the operation-- Mercedes stops by a young girl prepping a pork loin to be cooked
She isn't wearing gloves
Donde estan sus guantes
Tonta
Quiere matar a mis clientes
[Where are your gloves
Stupid
You want to kill my customers
] She continues past, shaking her bead, bringing us to Pilar, who is trying to stay out of the way-- These ones coming up are getting stupider every year
Maybe you're just getting less patient
If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco
Adelante
Los clientes esperan
Well, you hire illegals-- (Indignant) Nobody is illegal in my cafe
They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense 'd be very happy
If you spent a little more time training them-- Did you come here to tell me how to run my business
No
was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us
Maybe see where you grew up-- Why would  want to go there
Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed
Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and 've never been further than Ciudad Leon-- You want to see Mexicans, open your eyes and look around you
We're up to our ears in them
Pilar gives up on the trip
She watches her mother poking at the plates of chips and salsa ready to go out-- Mami, how old were you when my father-- He was killed
Right
When he was killed
little older than Paloma is now
How come you never got married again
Mercedes just glares at her-- There must have been somebody
(Mutters) was too busy
Nobody's too busy
Maybe now
It was different back then
had this place,  was doing all the shopping, all the cooking
What do  need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit
(Pissed off) Thank you
don't mean Fernando
Mami, the first time  brought him home, those were your exact words-- "some chulo with grease under his nails
" never said that
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody
felt that you could do better for yourself-- What
Become a nun
You didn't want me going out with Anglos-- never said that
It was just that boy-- "That boy"--Mami, say his name for chrissakes
The employees are staring
Mercedes won't look at her daughter as she steps out of the kitchen, banging into Enrique on his way back in-- You people are stealing my money-- Entiende
Robandome
Mercedes is gone
The young girl, pulling plastic gloves on, looks to Pilar
Su madre
[Your mother
] Si
The girl puts her hand on her heart in sympathy-- Lo siento [My condolences
] -- crowded room, &  plays on the box
Sam sits behind a bottle of beer as the bartender, , in his early 50s philosophizes
Now 'm just as liberal as the next guy-- If the next guy's a redneck
--but  gotta say  think there's something to this cold climate business
mean, you go to the beach- what do you do
Drink a few beers, wait for a fish to flop up on the sand
Can't build no civilization that way
You got a hard winter coming, though, you got to plan ahead, and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout
Good deal you were born down here, then
You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis
The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that
He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here
He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar
You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job
Take that pair over in the corner-- Sam swivels to look where Cody points-- Place like this, twenty years ago, Buddy woulda been, on them two-- '  -- Cliff and Priscilla talk across a table-- (
) --warning
Not 'cause he had it in for the colored --but just as a kind of safety tip
Yeah
bet he would
Old Sam stood for somethin', you know
The day that man died they broke the goddamn mold
-- Things are obviously more than professional between these two-- So where does that put us
Well-- don't see what's changed
No - 's, no necking on the obstacle course
Seriously
Seriously,  think we should get married
We been through this before-- We should just do it
And if  get a shot at a promotion somewhere-- You could take it-- It's up or out these days, Cliff
Say  get transferred to a different post-- 'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that
(Grins) Man's gonna retire in two years and he offer to quit
Big goddamn deal
(
) Excuse me-- They look up to see Sam standing over them-- Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth
Pleased to meet you
Sheriff Deeds was in on our archeological find yesterday
It true they gonna build a shopping mall out there
If certain people have their way, it's going to be a new jail
Damn
Maybe we got in the wrong business
They closin' down military bases left and right, puttin' up jails like 7-11 stores
Do either of you have any idea when they stopped using that site as a rifle range
They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s
It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year
You know who it was they dug up
Not for sure yet
But  kind of wish they hadn't
-- Enrique steps out of the darkened cafe, followed by Mercedes, who locks up
Mercedes steps over to an expensive-looking car-- Es muy lindo, su coche-- En ingles Enrique
This is the United States
We speak English
Is very beautiful, your car
Good night, Enrique
She slides into the car-- Buenas noches, Senora Cruz
Enrique walks in the opposite direction-- '  --  -- Del, in uniform, approaches the front door of Big 's, not open for business yet
We  as he stops to read a handlettered sign next to it: " " He steps in-- Late-50s & plays on the
Otis stands behind the counter hooking the beer taps up
Del steps in and sits on a stool at the far end of the bar, tense, looking around the place
When Otis sees him, he stops dead
They lock eyes for a moment, then Otis turns to call
Carolyn--knock that off for a minute
, an attractive woman maybe ten years younger than Otis, pulls the plug from the jukebox near where she's scrubbing bloodstains off the floor
She turns to look at the newcomer-- Del doesn't move to come closer-- Black Seminoles
(Shrugs) Hobby of mine
Got some artifacts, couple pieces one of your men out at the base made
Free admission
Del nods toward where Carolyn is mopping-- That where he was shot
That's where he fell
You get much of that in here
It's a bar
People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out-- Deal drugs in the bathroom-- If  thought it would help 'd put up a sign telling them not to
Right under the one about the employees washing their hands
Carolyn has come over by Otis, lugging the bucket and mop-- This here's Carolyn
Honey, this is my son, Delmore
Nice to meet you, Ma'am
Carolyn nods, shoots a look to Otis-- 'll be in back waiting for that delivery
They wail till she is gone to start again-- So
So tell me why  shouldn't make this place off-limits
This is an official visit, then-- assume a lot of your business is from our people
Otis pulls a tap back and it coughs before squirting beer
Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out
If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome
Been that way since before you were born
We have an enlisted man's club at the post
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you
It's your call
That's right
(Smiles) been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now
Boys say they heard he's a real hard case
Spit-and-polish man
Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here
The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is
Right
hear things, too
People call you the Mayor of Darktown
(Shrugs) Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there
loan a little money out, settle some arguments
Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night
There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other
There's the Holiness Church and there's Big 's place
And people make their choice-- (Smiles) lot of 'em choose both
There's not like a borderline between the good people and the bad people--you're not either on one side or the other-- Del looks away, not wanting to believe this-- (Softly) gonna meet that family of yours
Why would you want to do that
Because 'm your father
Del gives him a dark look and lets the statement hang between them
He gets up and heads for the door-- You'll get official notification when  make my decision
He is out the door--Otis pulls himself a beer as Carolyn steps back out-- So that's him-- Yeah--that's him
Got two, three thousand people under him out there, you count the civilians
That must be a laugh a minute
-- Sam walks down the main street of town
is gathering at the other end for the ceremony-- (
) Sheriff
We  as
and Jorge catch up to him
slaps Sam on the back-- Historic occasion, isn't it
Seems like we have another one every week
Jorge and his Chamber of Commerce boys got to keep things hummin'-- We're building up tourism, Sam-- People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon-- Sam-- You ought to put up a banner-- "Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut- Rate Pussy"-- That kind of talk doesn't help, Sam
Rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue-- got Eddie Richter at the Sentinel to kill that story
The Perdido thing
He agreed it wasn't exactly news-- Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time
Which is why we need to talk to you about the new jail--just so we're all on the same page
We don't need a new jail
That's a matter of interpretation-- We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow-- There was a mandate in the last election-- It wouldn't happen to be your construction company gonna get the bid on building this thing, would it,
And Jorge, you wouldn't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters-- Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned about crime-- We need a drug rehab program, we need a new elementary school-- There isn't money allocated for that
But a jail-- Look, 'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me,  got to tell them the truth
We-- don't--need--a new jail
When we backed you-- When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office
Hey, folks-- Sam and the others smile as they reach the  of townspeople, mostly small business owners and retired people
Photographers from the paper and a local  news crew wait by a veiled Statue roped off in a little traffic island
Mercedes, dressed to kill, stands waiting next to Hollis with a huge pair of scissors in her hand
Slowly working the blades of the scissors, she looks coldly at Sam-- He nods to her as the crowd opens a path for him
Let's get this thing over with
'  -- We start on a two-foot-high statue of a cowboy made from old bullets and shell casings
We  past a few others, the poses lifted from Frederic Remington paintings, till we see Mikey, gluing together a work in progress, a Remington book propped open in front of him
Cliff sits at the worktable playing absently with the old bullets spilled out from ' bag Never thought 'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder
think it's beyond what you'd call dating
You going to get married
(Shrugs) Maybe
You met her family
They gonna be cool about you being a white guy
Priscilla says they think any woman over 30 who isn't married must be a lesbian
She figures they'll be so relieved 'm a man-- Always heartwarming to see a prejudice defeated by a deeper prejudice
But marriage, man-- did two tours in Southeast Asia and  was married for five years-- couldn't tell you which experience was worse
Cliff picks up a slug-- Hey, Mikey-- knew she was Japanese going into it, but she didn't tell me the ninja assassin part-- Mikey-- Her parents acted like  was gonna blow my nose on their curtains-- Mikey-- If  stayed out past ten with the guys she'd go into her Madame Butterfly routine-- Mikey look at this-- What--it's a bullet
'm lousy with bullets here
It's a
45
Yeah
This is the stuff we picked up the other day, right
The rest of this is all
30 caliber-- They were using -1's, yeah-- What's it doing on a rifle range
holds the slug in front of his face-- We better call that Sheriff
-- Hollis is finishing his oration, having put the crowd in a good mood
Sometime in the early '70s a reporter from a national magazine was talking to the governor of our Lone Star state, and he asked him, "Governor, what's your ideal of what a real Texan ought to be
" Governor said, "That's easy, son- you just go down to Rio County and get a look at Sheriff Buddy Deeds
" Applause-- Watching the crowd-- ' We  with his gaze across smiling faces, till he comes to Danny and a couple of Chicano friends, looking grim
We beyond them to see Pilar, watching the ceremony from a few yards back-- (
) Thank you
We've got one more person to hear from-- --and he's somebody who probably knew Buddy better than any of us, Sam--would you say a few words
Not thrilled to be called on
He steps forward reluctantly to -- You folks who remember my father knew him as Sheriff
But at home he was also judge, jury He looks to Hollis-- --and executioner
Sam holds Hollis's eyes for a moment before continuing-- This is a real honor you're doing him today, and if Buddy was around 'm sure his hat size would be gettin' bigger every minute
Watching-- (
) used to come to this park to hide from him
Now that you're putting his name on it-- 'll have to find someplace new to duck out
More -- do appreciate it, and wherever he is, Buddy's puttin' the beer on ice for the bunch of you
Thank you
-- Sam steps back and Mercedes steps forward with her scissors without looking at him-- And now my fellow Council member and one of Frontera's most respected businesswomen, Mrs
Mercedes Cruz, will do the honors for us
She freezes, smiling, till the still photographers have gotten their shots, then snips the cord to a pulley system that lets the cloth drop-- The cloth drops to reveal a bas-relief in brass set in a block of smooth limestone
decent likeness of Buddy in uniform, his hand on the shoulder of a small Chicano-looking boy who stands beside him, eyes raised worshipfully
from the gathering-- Watching, a bit removed, as Mercedes shakes hands with Jorge and
and Hollis for the cameras
He overhears a pair of who are checking out the statue-- 1 (
) It does look like old Buddy
2 (
) Runnin that kid in for loiterin'-- The bystanders --Sam steps away, intercepting Mercedes as she steps away-- Nice to see you, Mrs
Cruz
Mercedes just looks at him, keeps going
His gaze brings him to Pilar, standing on the sidewalk, watching
Steps over from the dispersing crowd-- Field trip
Lunch hour
My next class isn't till nine-thirty
Want to take a walk
-- Sam and  walk together alongside the Rio-- Your mother still doesn't like me
can't name anybody she does like these days
see she built a place up here by the river
real palace
She rattles around alone in that thing-- She's done well for herself--on her own and all-- So she tells me three times a week
She looks at him-- thought you got through that pretty well
They cooked the whole thing up without asking me
People liked him
Most people did, yeah
remember him watching me once
When  was little--before you and -- She shrugs
was on the playground with all the other kids, but  thought he was only looking at me
was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know-- Yeah
Weird what you remember
They walk in silence a moment-- Your boy, there-- Amado
Nice-looking kid
He hates me
No-- With Paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate
But Amado--he's--he's never been book-smart
Had a hard time learning to read
Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment--like a betrayal
Fernando did okay, and he dropped out-- Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody
He just wanted to fix their cars
It might just be the age
spent my first fifteen years trying to be just like Buddy and the next fifteen trying to give him a heart attack
She looks at him-- So why did you come back here, Sam
Got divorced,  wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore
The fellas down here said they'd back me-- You don't want to be Sheriff
got to admit it's not what  thought it'd be
Back When Buddy had it-- hell, 'm just a jailer
Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows
It can happen so sudden, can't it
Being left out on your own
You've got your mother, your kids-- They've got me
Different thing
They stop at a spot where you can climb down the bank-- Remember this
Pilar looks at the spot
She isn't ready to deal with whatever memory it brings back-- should get back
Pilar-- Looks real bad if the teacher's late for class
It's really nice to talk with you, Sam
She waves and walks away, feeling awkward
Sam watches for a minute, then turns and steps down to the bank, He looks at the water
little piece of tree bark is tossed onto the water and drifts away with the current
We   to see tossing bark into the river as   sits on the bank beside her
They are 14 and 15 years old--It is 1972-- You going to tell her
You going to tell him
He doesn't need to know all my business
He's gonna find out
So
What's he gonna do, arrest us
Young Pilar frowns, tosses more bark-- It's supposed to be some big sin, even if you love each other
You believe that
She turns to look at him-- No
We  with her gaze to see Sam,  , sitting on the bank, lost in thought-- Me neither
-- Athena walking between buildings, looking a bit out of it
Sergeant Worth cuts into her-- Private Johnson
Sergeant
Report to Dr
Innis at the clinic
'm feeling okay-- 'm very happy to hear that, Private
Now you go put some pee-pee in a cup for Dr
Innis and 'll be feeling okay, too
(Reacts) You're testing me
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals
Put it in gear
Yes, Sergeant
Sergeant Worth watches Athena go, suspicious-- '  -- Ray Hernandez and another  guide Shadow back in from the courthouse in handcuffs-- Excellent performance, my friend
The judge was very impressed
You don't need to cuff me
You been talking so much trash today, you made us think you're a dangerous criminal
Be a good boy, now-- They guide him past Sam's desk-- You're the one who's a good boy
Man say "fetch" and you fetch-- Just doing my job
White man just using you to keep the Black man down
This isn't Houston, my friend
We pretty much running things now
Our good day has come
You suckers haven't had a good day since the Alamo
Ray smiles, pushes him out-- Andale, amigo, We  on Sam at his desk,  as he holds the
45 slug from the sergeants in front of his eyes-- Lupe

She sinks into a recliner
We  as she closes her eyes
Something out In the dark
Mercedes opens her eyes
There is Mercedes sits up and suddenly two  run past the edge of the patio toward the front of the house
Mercedes sighs-- Otra vez los mojados--[Wetbacks again--] Mercedes searches to find a portable phone on the patio table, punches a number in-- Hello
Border Patrol
'  -- Sam, out of uniform, stands behind his little house chucking fallen pecans out into the dark, thinking, listening to the night sounds
Working something out in his head
He looks off into the dark and we  with his gaze--  steps toward us, barely visible in the darkness
It is Charley Wade--We're in Sam's , in 1957-- Who is that
Come out here where can see you
, and Wade falls to his knees-- You sonofabitch-- Wade falls on his face
flicks  and plays over his body
We  back along the be to see Buddy, holstering his Pistol
He hears something, swings the flashlight up
We are back in 1995

Sam, squinting toward the light to see who it is, raises his hands over his head-- (
) Get that thing off 'im
He's one of ours-- Zack
The     and  , a Border Patrol agent, steps out of the dark to Sam-- Hey Sam
Sorry 'bout that
What's up
We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver
They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way
haven't seen anybody come by
We'll get 'em-- (Looks around) So you livin' out here now
Yeah
It's quiet-- heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud
Sure
The stories people tell, he was a real colorful fella-- (
) Zack
We got one
Well--back on the clock
You see any of our neighbors from the south, let 'em know 'm lookin' for 'em
'Night-- Zack steps away
Sam shakes the pecans still in his band, goes back to chucking them-- -- Older   dance to Mexican Music playing from speakers set up in the apartment complex courtyard
We to see Enrique watching from his window-- -- still blasting
Enrique steps away from the window, and sits on the bed of his drab furnished apartment
He goes back to tying knots in a length of clothesline splicing it to another
On the bed beside him are new flashlights and the batteries, still in their packaging
He begins to coil the rope--it is hundreds of feet long

They listen to the -- (
) What's she singing about
(Smiles) What do you think
'  -- Sam has been up since dawn, searching through piles of old department records
Papers cover his desk and the chairs he's dragged over next to it
He reads out loud himself from a report in front of him-- First bullet entered beneath the left eye, severing the optical nerve and exiting from top rear of skull causing tissue damage -- As Sam reads, we see quick pops of various records-- Certificates of death
An old Sheriff's Department payroll
An autopsy report
Eviction notices

) --and severe cerebral hemorrhaging
Second bullet entered left cheek driving fragment of upper and lower molars into base of skull

, a skinny, older man in trustee's coveralls, wanders in, emptying the trash baskets in the front office-- Morning, Sheriff
Hey, Pete
How's it going
Time marches on
How much you got left
Three months
You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight
It was for personal consumption
You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana
got a bad stomach
It helps me digest
Pete dumps out the basket by Sam-- Your father never bothered me about it
Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s
thought he busted you a couple times
Different charge
had a still
Made my own mescal
Sam looks up at him
That's how  ruined my stomach
(Smiles) 'm surprised he bothered with it
He was afraid  was going to poison somebody
Your father tried to do good for people-- So 've heard-- And your mother was a saint
That summer  built the patio at your house
She made me lunch every day
Well, you were working there-- It could have just been a box lunch from the jail
Sam looks up again, troubled
You built our patio while you  were on the county
Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day
Sheriff Buddy, man
Como el no hay dos
And after that cabron Charley Wade-- 've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans-- He murdered Eladio Cruz
That tough enough for you
Murdered him
Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes
Shot him in cold blood
-- Ray Hernandez, heading in to work, comes upon Sam getting into his car-- You're out early
Yeah
Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately
been working on a few things
Uh-huh
'm going over to the other side
(Concerned) The Republicans
No--to Mexico
've got to talk to somebody
They got telephones
Gotta be in person
Oh
An awkward silence
Sam sits into the driver's seal and Ray leans down to talk-- Sam
--the Committee--you know Jorge and
and all--they asked me-- They want you to stand for Sheriff next election
Yeah
You'd do a good job
How 'bout you
Don't know if 'll still want it
didn't want to be going around your back
appreciate you telling me
Sam looks at his Chief Deputy-- You think we need a new jail
Well, it's a complicated issue-- Sam smiles, turns the engine on-- Yeah, Ray, you'd be a hell of a Sheriff
-- Pilar sits with Amado on the football field bleachers before school starts-- 'm only going to have you for two more years
If you decide not to go on to college-- can't take any more school
--you're going to be on your own
So
So 'm worried about you
don't want you to end up in jail like your friends
They're not going to jail
Don't try to con me, Amado
You knew how they got all those things
Just some rich Anglo out on the lake
Don't even live here all year
That makes it okay
They stole our land-- Save your breath
That line doesn't cut it with me
silence
Amado sulks
How do you think you're going to make a living
can fix cars
You can fix old cars
Mr
Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized-- You think  can't learn that
think you can learn whatever you want to
just don't see you doing it
If you want to settle for-- 'm not settling for anything like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste
That isn't true
Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant
When Dad-- If you grew up to he anywhere near as good a man as your father was, would be happy
would be thrilled
They look, at each other for a long moment
It's my life
If  want to fuck it up, that's my business
(Nods) said pretty much the same thing to my mother when  was your age
And what did she do
Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help
Catholic school, nasty
Pilar is nearly in tears
Honey,  think you're smart and you're good and  love you
So don't act like an idiot, all right
-- We see Sam's car roll through the "express lane" as other cars in both directions stop by the inspection booths
Sam drives across the bridge over the Rio-- --   -- Sam drives slowly through the sprawling, more populous town on the other side
Lots of the streets are unpaved
We with the car till we  on , a country girl of 15, aimlessly walking the streets-- (  ) -- We watch a  about Amado's age pulling a tire off its rim to put a patch on it-- (
) Over here we don't throw everything away like you gringos do
, in his mid-50s, stands by Sam drinking a Coke as they watch the kid work
Recycling, right
We invented that
The government doesn't have to tell people to do it
You own this place
This place, the one across the street, four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- soy el Rey de las Llantas
King of the Tires
Lots of your people rollin' back over that bridge on my rubber
(Nods) You lived in the States for a while
Fifteen years in El Paso
Made some money, came back here-- Something like that
You ever know a fella named Eladio Cruz
smiles, draws a line in the dirt with his heel-- You the sheriff of Rio County, right
Un jefe muy respetado
Step over this line
Sam obliges-- Ay, que milagro
You're not the Sheriff of nothing anymore- just some tejano with a lot of questions don't have to answer
Sam smiles, plays with the line with his toe-- Bird flying south-you think he sees that line
Rattlesnake, javelina-- whatever you got--halfway across that line they don't start thinking different
So why should a man
Your government always been pretty happy to have that line
The question's just been where to draw it My government can go fuck itself, and so can yours
'm talking about people here--men
Mi amigo Eladio Cruz is giving some friends of his a lift in his camion one day-- We  from  to the   on a battered old pickup truck-- (
) --but because he's on one side of this invisible line and not the other, they got to hide in the back like criminals-- Eladio , young and good-looking, squats into the shot to examine the tire, jack in hand
It Is 1956-- (
) And because over there he's just another Mex bracero, any man with a badge is his jefe-- comes from the truck
steps past Eladio-- Donde vas, Chucho, Tienes que quedar escondido
[Shit,  you got to stay hidden
] Voy a romper las rinones si no hago pipi--['m gonna bust my kidneys if don't pee--] We  back with Young  to see we are at the side of a dirt road on the scrubby flatland near the border
Eladio's battered pickup truck has wood-slat sides and a canvas top
Eladio begins to undo the nuts on the flat tire as Young climbs down into a dry creek bed to relieve himself-- Los demas son tan espantados que prefieran mojar sus pantalones
[The other guys are so scared they'd rather wet their pants
] tightens as he sees something, ducks down-- Mira, Eladio [Look
] We  to see the Sheriff's car approaching in a cloud of -- (Calling from where he lies changing the tire) Muchachos
Escondases
[Boys
Hide yourselves
] Eight illegal  hear this and lie down, pulling a canvas tarp over themselves
We hear the   behind them-- -- He makes the sign of the cross as he presses his back against the dirt of the arroyo-- Sheriff Wade and Deputy Hollis get out of their car and start toward Eladio-- He stands, takes a deep breath--Wade steps up to him with his hard-eyed smile-- Hola, amgio
Problemas de llanta
[Hey, friend
Tire problems
] No hay de que
Tengo otra
[No problem, 've got another
] What's in the back
Young Hollis strolls around the truck as if he's considering buying it
He reaches in and flicks the  -- Not much, jefe
Some watermelons
heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road
haven't seen anybody doing that
This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help
Como se llama, amigo
Eladio Cruz
You know this road got a bad reputation, Eladio-- -- Young  pecks over the edge to see what's happening
Reputation
Bandidos, Injuns-- -- Hollis wanders over to stand by Wade-- There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch
Hope you're carrying some protection
Protection
You carryin' a firearm, son
Don't lie to me now
Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun-- Just a shotgun, huh
Better let me take a look at that
opens the truck door and digs under the seat
Wade winks to Hollis, then turns and
shoots  through the head
Hollis jumps back startled and horrified-- Oh no--oh Jesus--oh my Lord-- Little greaser sonofabitch been running a goddarn bus service
Think he can make a fool out of Charley Wade
Get them wets outta the back, Hollis, see what we've got-- Squatting in a ball to make himself as small as possible, eyes covered with his hands
(
) You killed him-- (
) You got a talent for statin' the obvious, son Muchachos
Venga afuera
Brazos arribas
[Come on out
Hands up
] Young  hears  approaching
We  as he looks-- a man's  appear at the top of the arroyo
We   to see a Sheriff, , then  to see it is Sam, back in the  looking over the site, troubled
His car sits on the empty road behind him
He frowns, turns to go-- --  -- Somebody has spray-painted "
" over the plaque of Buddy and the little boy-- (
) Hooligans-- Hollis and a couple of  from the Public Work Department look at the damage
It happens again, we build a fence around it
-- Enrique steels himself, trying to cover his nerves
We with him to a booth
Podemos ganar muchas batallas pero la guerra ya es perdido--[We can win a lot of battles but the war's already been lost--] Zack and another   look up at him-- Eyes glued to his notepad-- You wan' something to drink
--  -- Georgia 'Keefe-looking cattle skull sits on a pedestal against the Western sky-- (
) The longhorns go for ten times the price-- We  as the skull is lifted by  , a Native American man in his 70s who wears extremely thick glasses
Sam tags along as the old man rearranges the display of Texas curios laid out in front of his trailer
Empty scrubland surrounds them
--but longhorns are hard to come by these days
You sell much out here
How am  gonna sell things if nobody comes by
This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much
Hell of a spot to put a business
But you don't see much competition, do you
He winks at Sam, picks up a wooden radio carved to resemble the Alamo-- These things used to sell like hotcakes
Now, if it can't play those discs, they won't look at it
He puts the radio on, looks out at the emptiness around-- like it here
Once  tried going onto that reservation to live
Couldn't take the politics
Damn Indian'll drive you crazy with that, Now your father--this wasn't what he had in mind at all
He come out of Korea, he had this Chevy with too much engine in it
He'd come roarin' up and down this road all hours of the day and night,looking for somebody to race
He lifts a jar with a leathery brown thing in it-- Buffalo chips
Fella in Santa Fe told me he sells these as fast as the buffalo can squeeze 'em out
So when did Buddy leave
For Frontera
Hell,  can't remember dates no more
do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him
He almost took some poor fella's head off at the Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured it was time to move on
You think he killed anybody in Korea
They don't hand those medals out for hidin'in your foxhole
Would you buy this
No-- Me neither
He searches for something among the curios-- If he hadn't found that Deputy job, believe Buddy might've gone down the other path, got into some serious trouble
Settled him right down
That and your mother
'Course he had that other one later
Another woman
Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch
Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through
You know who it was
The other one
Hell, at my age, every time you learn a new name you got to forget an old one
Your head's all crowded up--here it is-- Wesley stretches out a four-foot rattlesnake skin, rattles still attached-- This big fella was sleepin' in a crate at Cisco's junkyard right when looked to see what was in it
Jumped up at my face--scared me so bad killed him without thinkin'
He shakes the rattles at Sam-- Gotta be careful where you're pokin'-- who knows what you'll find
-- talks with Molly as they near the administration office-- don't think you can take it personally-- 'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other-- should get combat pay-- have new respect for some of my kids, meeting the parents they've been dealt-- Molly keeps going as Pilar ducks into the office-- See you, Molly
crosses past the principal's secretary, -- Steve called for you
Steve
Steve
Board of Education Steve who likes you
He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls,  can tell
Spanish, please
My mother would have a heart attack
Your mother's family is Spanish
Sure, they go back to Cortez
When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner
You got to be interested in somebody
All you do is work
All my mother does is work
That's how you get to be Spanish
How 'bout the Sheriff
The Sheriff
The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff
thought you were crazy about each other
He's available, you're available-- 'm unmarried
'm not available
You told me one time it was true love
takes the pile of mimeos and mail from her slot and turns to go-- (Mutters) Nobody stays in love for twenty-three years
-  -- It is 1972
An early-'70s cheezy action picture (Filipino women-in-chains or biker flick is playing
We   to a man's  crunching across the gravel of the parking area
Now and then, the man turns a   on a license plate
The cars are all pre-'72, lots of pickups, and the patrons are almost all
Some have turned their pickups around to sit on the tailgate and watch, while others have set lawn furniture out to sit on
We   slightly to see the glint of a Rio County Sheriff's badge pinned on the man's shirt
He meets a  coming in the other direction
Both train their  on the license of the car we see in the b
g
between them
We  and to see that nobody is visible through the window-- (
) Let's go
We  Buddy up to the driver's side of the car as the Deputy goes to the passenger side
We  with Buddy's hand down to the door handle--he grabs it, flings it open--the overhead  flicks  and there lie   and , teenagers, half their clothes off and just about to close the deal
and the Deputy throws the door open by their heads-- Goddammit
Buddy grabs Sam's ankles and yanks him out of the car onto the ground as the Deputy awkwardly pulls , out the other side-- What the hell are you doing
You fucking asshole
How old is that girl
Goddammit, where's your goddam sense
(
) Let me go
Pendejo
(
) Come on now, Missy, get your clothes in order-- Sam is trying to kick and punch at his father, pausing in between to pull his pants up
People are  and their  all around-- You got no fuckin' right
You stay out of my fuckin' life
Gimme the keys--gimme the goddamn car keys, son-- (
) What am  s'posed to do with her, Buddy
You drive her home and tell her mother where we found her-- (
) Sam
The kids are dragged forward into the  that are being turned on to see what the ruckus is
Both are crying, struggling-- You leave her the fuck alone
You just shut that filthy mouth, son
'll deal with you when we get home-- Please, don't tell my mother
She's gonna kill me
They step closer into the glaring  which the scene, then
- -- It is ,
Our eyes readjust to see Sam, standing by his car in the lot of the long-abandoned drive- in
The ruined screen rises in the b
g
Remembering
as he gets back into the car, pulls away
-- as the car cruises out past the old marquee, a few letters still jumbled on it, several bullet holes around them
as Sam drives, thinking-- --   -- / as the car crosses the scrubland back toward town
turns to -- '  -- as Sam cruises past Pilar's house
The car is not in the driveway: Paloma hangs out with a couple under the porch light, laughing-- -- as Sam's car pulls into the high school lot
He looks up toward the school-- , , -- ' We can see , through the lighted window of her classroom, preparing something on the blackboard-- as Sam leans back to wait-- digs in her bag for her car keys as she makes her way across the lot
She sees something, slows, reacting, then brings us to Sam in his car
He has parked head-to-foot next to hers
They look at each other for a long moment (Softly) Follow me
-- Nothing stirring
Pilar's car appears, closely followed by Sam's
The cafe has closed for the night
-- Sam and Pilar sit on chairs next to each other, facing the window, talking softly
The  shining through the letters in the front window makes patterns on their faces We thought we were something, didn't we
Yeah
look at my kids in school--tenth, eleventh graders
That's who we were
Children
Yeah
mean what did we know about anything
Nothing
Pilar looks at him-- When Nando died--it was so sudden-- was kind of in shock for awhile
Then  woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and  didn't have any idea what to do with it
You know the other day, you asked why  came back
Yeah
came back 'cause you were here
nods
She gets up and we  her across the dark room to the jukebox
She looks at the selections-- My mother hasn't changed the songs since  was 10
She puts in a quarter, punches some numbers
Mexican comes on
She crosses back to Sam, holds her hand out
He stands to greet her
They slow-dance in the empty cafe-- '  -- Sam and Pilar finish making love
They lie beside each other, shaking a little-- Wow
Yeah
How come it feels the same
don't know
It just feels good
Always did
So what are we gonna do about this
More,  hope
smiles, looks around the room-- How long have you lived here
Two years
There's nothing on the walls
No pictures-- Don't have kids
Other pictures-- don't know--it's nothing  want to look back on
Like your story is over
've felt that way, yeah
Sbe puts her head on his cbest-- It isn't
Not by a long shot
He holds her and they lie silently for a moment-- Pilar-- Yeah
What was your father's name
Eladio
Eladio
Cruz
: '  -- Paloma sits on the top step of the porch, reading teen magazines
steps out behind her, dressed casually, and squints at the day-- She finally got in-- It's Saturday
You got in late last night
Yeah
had uhm--school business
Paloma gives her a look, then holds a fashion page up for her to see-- Can  get this
Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma
could name five girls at school who have one just like it-- Enough with the clothes-- Just 'cause you went to Catholic school and wore a uniform
only went for my last two years
How come
Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys
steps out into the sun-- Did it work
-- Hollis is sitting alone in a booth, working on some heuvos rancheros
Sam slides in across from him-- Morning, Hollis
Sam
Quite a do the other day
It meant a lot to folks that you said something
You thought any more about our murder
We have a murder
Charley Wade
wish  could tell you  remembered something new, but  can't
got an idea what happened
Do you
think somewhere between Roderick Bledsoe's club and his house, Wade ran into Buddy Deeds
think Buddy put a bullet in him, waited for him to die, threw him in the trunk of the Sheriff's car and drove him out by the Army post,  think he buried him under four feet of sand and never looked back
Hollis sits back to look Sam in the eye-- You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years
And you didn't get to know him any better than that
got to go see somebody in San Antonio today
Your memory gets any better, 'll be back tonight
Sam stands and walks away
We  on Hollis, his appetite gone-- ' -- Chet steps around to the side entrance-- --  -- We start on a statue of a   made from spent bullets and shell casings, then  to another, then to see Chet as he pokes his head in, the  of the door ringing
He steps in cautiously, looking around the room
On the walls there are photo-blowups, some artifacts, handlettered information on cardboard
Chet stops to look up at a picture of a barechested Black man with a couple of feathers stuck in his headband (
) That's John Horse
Chet turns to see Otis standing back by, the door from the bar-- Spanish in Florida called him Juan Caballo
John Horse
(Looks at picture) He a Black man or an Indian
(Steps in) Both
Otis crosses to the poker table, begins to clean up-- He was part of the Seminole Nation, got pushed down into the Everglades in pioneer days
African people who run off from the slaveholders hooked up with them, married up, had children
When the Spanish give up Florida, the
Army come down to move all them Indian peoples off to Oklahoma-- The Trail of Tears
(Smiles) They teaching that now
Good
Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola
Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years
Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee
So they stayed in Florida
They got tired of fighting, went to the Indian Territories for a while
But the slave-raiders were on 'em even there, and one night they packed up and nearly the whole band rode down to Mexico
Crossed at Eagle Pass
They move on to some photos of very African-looking people dressed in beautiful Seminole clothing-- Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War
The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts
Best trackers either side of the border
Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche-- They fought against the Indians
Same as they done in Mexico
But they were Indians themselves
They were in the Army
Like your father
(Surprised) You know who  am
got a pretty good guess
That guy who got shot-- You didn't go telling your father you were here
Are you kidding
And face a court- martial
(Smiles) He's a pretty tough old man, huh
No sports if  don't keep a  average, no  on school nights, no 's-- Public Display of Affection
Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more-- Well-- mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know-- Didn't have a father
(Shrugs) He's still pissed off about it
When you're his age you'll still be pissed off about him
Chet nods, looks around-- So how come you got into all this
These are our people
There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor-- So 'm part-Indian
By blood you are
But blood only means what you let it
My father says the day you're  born you start from scratch, no breaks and no excuses, and you got to pull yourself up on your own
(Sad) Well, he's living proof of that, son
Living proof
'  -- Athena stands at attention as Del sits at his desk, reviewing her record
He lets her stand for a long time before speaking-- Private Johnson, are you unhappy in the Army
No, sir-- Then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested, you're the only one who came up positive for drugs
'm sorry, sir
When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon
think the Army has honored its part of that agreement
Yes, sir-- Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson
- can do the job, sir
You don't sound too enthusiastic
am, sir
What exactly do you think your job is, Private
Follow orders
Do whatever they say
Who's "they"
The--the officers
And that's the job
Nothing about serving your country
Athena is confused, hesitates to speak-- These aren't trick questions, Private
You'll be given an Article 15 and be going into the  Program one way or the other
What happens after that is up to you
'm just trying to understand how somebody like you thinks
Silence-- Well
(Hesitant) You really want to know, sir
Please
It's their country
This is one of the best deals they offer
Del knows he asked for it, but doesn't like the answer-- How do you think  got to be a colonel
Work hard, be good at your job
Sir
Do whatever they tell you
Do whatever they tell you-- mean, follow orders, sir
With your attitude, Private, 'm surprised you want to stay in the service
do, sir
Because it's a job
(Struggling) Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's-- Chaos
Athena is sure she's overstepped her rank-- Why do you think they let us in on the "deal"
They got people to fight
Arabs, yellow people, whatever
Might as well use us
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post
No, sir
Not at all
Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers
No, sir
They all been real straight with me
Del stands, thinking, trying not to bullshit her-- It works like this, Private--every soldier in a war doesn't have to believe in what he's fighting for
Most of them fight just to back up the soldiers in their squad--you try not to get them killed, try not to get them extra duty, try not to embarrass yourself in front of them
He is right in her face now-- Why don't you start with that
Yes, sir
You're dismissed, Private
Thank you, sir
Athena salutes, steps out
Del looks out the window, troubled by the encounter

'd like to ride that horse--] -- Sam's car is parked on the street in front of an expensive- looking house in a tree-lined neighborhood-- Sam's ex-wife,  , shuffles across her living room in slippers, crossing to turn off a big-screen  playing football highlights
Bunny wears shorts, a Houston Oilers sweatshirt and a Dallas Cowboys cap
The living room is like a sports museum-- signed footballs, team posters, a bookcase filled with tapes of Texas pro and college football games-- The Longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this Saturday, you just watch
We got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta El Indio-- (
) That's in Maverick County
She brings us to Sam, sitting uncomfortably, beneath a full- sized blowup of Tony Dorsett hurdling a tackler-- Oh
Right
And you're in--
Rio
Right
This kid, Hosea Brown
Does tire 40 in 3
4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package
Only a sophomore-- You still going to all the home games
Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and 'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference
Then there's the high school on Friday' nights
West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat
High school, we're talkin'
Guess how much he can bench-press
Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication
Do  seem jumpy
No, you look good
was just wondering
Last year was awful rough--Mama passing on and the whole business with
-- mean it's not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop-- You look good-- --and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal-- Yeah, well-- --they hadn't pulled me off that woman  would have jerked a knot in her
You were in a fight-- Daddy calls it an "altercation
" How you doing, Sam
You look skinny
Same weight  always was
You look awful good in that uniform, though
Best part of the job
Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job
He says so himself
Says "Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead  got now"
Bunny, is that stuff  left in the garage still there
Least he never called me that
With me, it was always "high-strung
" "My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung
" Or "tightly wound," that was another one
You seeing anyone
No
You
Yeah
Sort of
Daddy rounds 'em up
You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead
You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you
The stuff left in the garage--some of it was my father's-- You watch the draft this year
'Course you didn't, idiot question
They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round
Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months
Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell,  wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed
All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad
Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it
Suppose not
You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam
All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know  was tightly wound-- It wasn't just you, Bunny
No, it wasn't, was it
You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you
She looks at him for an uncomfortably long moment-- Your shit's still in the garage if that's what you came for
Sam nods, stands
Bunny is in tears-- 350 pounds
What
This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways
Bench-presses 350 pounds
You imagine having that much weight on top of you
Pushing down
Be hard to breathe
Hard to swallow
think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest
spotter
" only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline
" Then he tells me  can't be in the box anymore if  can't control myself
Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the  now and then
do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people
(Edging out) You look good, Bunny
It's nice to see you
(Smiles) Thanks
like it when you say that, Sam
-- Enrique looks nervously over his shoulder before stepping into a funky apartment building
We  up to the second floor balcony, where a   is watching the street-- There are eight  not including the little boy on the balcony
All are securing their possessions--rolling things in blankets, filling shopping bags and grain sacks
Enrique steps in-- Todos estamos

] Nadie nos veran
Seramos invisibles
Nobody's going to see us
We'll be invisible

We start on a campaign poster with Sam's face on it and the legend--"    -- "
We  to see Sam, who has been digging through piles of old junk, set down the box he was looking for-- Sam pulls out an old holster, a sheaf of real estate and insurance forms, a couple of old paperback Zane Grey westerns
He pulls out a cracked leather pouch, turns it over--letters fall out
He examines an envelope--no stamp or postmark-- pulls a letter out, reads-- "Dearest Buddy--" He puts the letter down for a moment, thinks
He needs to know
He picks the letter up again, reads

Del stands there-- Hey, it's the General
Colonel
Is uhm--is Otis in
Come on in-- If it's too late-- Come on in
Del enters the house as if walking into an -- '   -- Carolyn sits back in the couch, drink in hand, checking Del out-- Otis sittin' up with some people at the club
don't think he'll be long
Uncomfortable, sitting at the edge of an easy chair
He looks at a mounted magazine photo of Otis smiling as he pours hot sauce on a rack of ribs-- His hot sauce recipe won a contest last year
They sellin' it far away as San Antonio
He got a lot of talent, your father
Del squirm a bit at the word "father"-- You've been in this house for a while
been here with him eight years now
He built it when he was with Leora
never met her
There was a bunch of 'em You never met
Me neither
Del looks around the living room-- Let me show you around-- -- blowup of a photo of a squad of Buffalo Soldiers is mounted on the wall-- (
) He got into all this cowboys and Indians stuff awhile back
Spend half his time pokin' around in the library way up to Austin
He looks at something below -- '  -- We  slowly over laminated newspaper clippings mounted behind a picture of young Del in a track uniform, holding a vaulting pole
The clippings are about Del making honor rolls, winning a Silver Star in Vietnam, graduating from Officer Candidate School, being named head of this and that in the Army-- (
) Kind of like a shrine, isn't it
, Carolyn stands behind, watching Del's face as he looks at the stuff-- Where'd he get all this
Your mother got a brother--Alphonse-- Uncle Al-- Otis stood on good terms with the man
Whenever you do something makes the news, he sends it on
When they made you General, Otis just about drove away all our customers going on about it
'm a colonel
Yeah,  know--Man made me memorize the whole damn Army chain of command before he'd marry me
So this is a big deal, commander and  all
It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but  moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command
Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War
Colin whatsit
My mother said he never asked about-- He never asked her
It's a bit too much for Del-- Listen,  uh--tell him  came by
Thanks-- We  on Carolyn as he hurries out
She salutes-- Catch you later, Colonel
-- , crouching low, wade across the river toward us
When he gets close enough to us, we recognize Enrique, nervously leading a group of Mexican men, women and children to the side
They are spaced out in the dark, loosely holding the line Enrique made in one hand and holding their bundles high away from the water with the other
Enrique turns as he hears a '
The line goes slack, then  steps out of the darkness to join him-- Que Paso
[What happened
] Anselma cayo en las rocas
Creo que la pierna ha sido root--[Anselma felt on the rocks
think her leg's broken--] Two men struggle forward supporting Anselma, trying to hold her leg out straight in front of her
She is in a lot of pain-- No podemos alcanzar el camion llevando a ella
Hay lugar para esconderla
[We can't reach the truck if we're carrying her
Is there somewhere to hide her
] Enrique thinks, trying not to panic, as the others come up around him-- Conozco solamente una persona con casa--[ only know one person with a house--] (In pain) Esta lejos
[Is it far
] -- Mercedes sits on her recliner, drink in hand
An old plays from inside
She is startled by the voice from the dark-- (
) Senora Cruz
(Standing) Quien es
[Who is it
] Soy yo, Enrique
No tiene miedo-- [It's me, Enrique
Don't be afraid] Enrique steps out into the light
His pants are wet and he's scared-- What are you doing out there
Are you crazy
Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- [There's been a bad accident--] In English, Enrique
We're in the United States-- have some friends who have had a accident-- You have somebody else out there
We was by the river
And  hear my friend callin' for help, and  look and she has falling in the water-- Don't tell me lies, Enrique
Que paso
We was crossin' the river-- Nestor appears in the light now, supporting Anselma, who hops awkwardly to move forward-- Enrique
Quienes son estos
How could you bring them here
They need help
Jaime, Anselma-- esta es mi jefa-- Senora-- 'll call the Border Patrol, they'll get her to the hospital
No
No puede hacer esto--[You can't do that--] You think you're doing these people a favor
What are they going to do
Either they get on welfare or they become criminals-- No es la verdad--[That isn't true--] Con permiso, Senora, la muchacha tiene mucho dolor--[Please, Senora, the girl is in a lot of pain--] Mercedes grudgingly indicates the lounge chair-- Sientase

The Girl looks up at Mercedes, frightened-- Ayudanos, Senora, por favor no podemos regresar--[Help us, Senora, please
We can't go back] Mercedes looks at  disapprovingly
The girl can't be more than 14-- This girl is a friend of yours

) Donde esta
Estoy perdido--[Where are you

Young Mercedes, a teenager not unlike  is wading thigh-deep in the Rio, lost, scared-- No puedo ver la orilla

Come this way

Tenemos a ella
[Don't worry
We've got her
] He takes her arm, pulls her toward the far shore-- Como se llama
[What's your name
] Mercedes Gonzales Ruiz
(Smiles) Me llama Eladio Cruz--Bienvenido a Tejas
[Welcome to Texas

She steps into the light by the carport
Enrique and Nestor are propping Anselma's leg up on pillows in the back of Mercedes' old station wagon-- Rapidamente
Everybody in the world is going to see
Donde vamos
[Where are we going
] casa de Porfirio Zayas
He used to be a doctor on the other side
Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it
Senora, anything it costs,  can work-- Don't worry about it
He owes me some favors
Enrique turns to  still frightened in the rear of the station wagon-- Seas tranquila, mija
(Nods to Mercedes) Estamos en las manos de Senora Cruz
[Just relax, honey
We're in the hands of Senora Cruz
] Mercedes starts the car-- In English, Enrique
In English-- '  -- Del steps in
Chet sits at the table, drawing a cartoon in panels
Del looks over his shoulder for a moment-- tank rolling over barbed wire, cannon and machine gun blasting away-- (
) Homework
finished that
'm just messing around
Tanks, huh
You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive
So you're going into the Army
Chet looks at him, not in a good mood, then goes back to his drawing-- That's the general plan, isn't it
Del watches for a long moment, thinking-- (Softly) That's up to you
Chet looks at his father again
All this is news to him-- The Army isn't for everybody
Chet can't quite believe he is hearing this
Del crosses to the refrigerator-- Not that  don't think you'd be good at it, but--you know-- wouldn't be disappointed if you decided to do something else with your life
You wouldn't
No
Chet nods, begins to play again, considering the possibilities
Del is making an effort and he doesn't have much practice-- How's your room shaping up
Fine
'm pretty much moved in
Good
An awkward silence-- (Tentative) Are we going to ever see your father
My father
Yeah
He lives here, right
He does
Del pulls some food out, watching Chet as he draws-- Maybe we'll clean that thing out back up, have a barbecue next weekend
We could invite him and his wife over
Cool
Chet flips the page of his sketchbook-- He makes his own sauce
,  ' -- The neon's off, but there are a couple cars in the lot and a light within
Sam pulls into the lot, steps out, approaches the door-- The door opens
The place is empty now except for Otis, standing behind the bar, deep in conversation with Hollis, sitting on a stool
Both swivel to look around guiltily as they hear Sam step in-- Sam walks in slowly, crossing the floor to bring us back to the two men-- Fellas
Hey, Sam
Open late
'm not open
We were just talking
Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade
Yeah
How about that
People start digging holes in this county, there's no telling what'll come up
He sits a few stools away from Hollis-- You two saw it, didn't you
You two saw it when Buddy killed him
Hollis and 0tis look at each other-- Imonna find out one way or the other
Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man  ever met-- Yeah, and my mother was a saint
For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side
Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business
But hell, what's that
You got a problem
Buddy'll fix it
Facing some time in jail
Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says
You got some business that's not exactly legal
Talk to Buddy-- Buddy Deeds-- Buddy Deeds was a murderer
He looks at the two older men for a long moment-- That night in the cafe--he didn't stay long after you left, did he, Hollis
Maybe he decided he'd gone too far with Wade, maybe he figured he better not wait for the Sheriff to get behind him
So he stepped out to see if he could catch up--and you were here at the club that night, weren't you,
Otis sighs, begins to speak softly-- was here
He turns to look toward the door as he reminisces, and we away with his gaze-- (
) 'd been running a game on the side after hours craps, draw poker on the weekends
Roderick didn't know about it
More important, Charley Wade didn't know about it, 'cause  didn't want to cut him in
suppose 'd been drinking some, and  was pretty full of myself in those days--but hell,  just didn't expect the man so early-- Sheriff Wade and Young Hollis step in the door and we are back in 1957
, wailing from the jukebox
They stop and look at the place-- -- The club is empty, dark
shines from the back room
Smoke fills the air and Young Otis sits back laughing, a large pile of money on the table in front of him
The other four   at the table aren't doing so well
One by one they all look up past the camera to the door-- Young Otis doesn't see at first, engaged in dealing the cards
Finally, he senses the presence, looks up-- --  ' Wade stands over the table in the f
g
, Young Hollis hanging back in the doorway
Wade is smiling his cold smile, cursing-- Trying to look unimpressed-- ' Cold and unblinking
-- ' Twisted in a snarl as he curses
-- , We shoot past Wade's body as the other men step away from the table, grab their hats, and hurry out the side door
Young Otis is left sitting at the table
Wade starts walking toward him-- His eyes following as Wade comes to stand over him-- , Wade grabs the table and violently jerks it over onto Young Otis, cards and money flying-- Watching squeamishly as Wade goes to work on young Otis, the overhead light swinging wildly-- Young Otis is hurled out of the back room, face bruised and bleeding
Wade follows, then Young Hollis-- Wade puts his gun next to Young Otis's ear, cursing at him
Young Otis gets to his feet, goes behind the bar-- Young Otis slaps an envelope full of cash onto the counter-- He waves his pistol, indicating something behind Otis-- We shoot past Wade at the counter as Otis turns and reaches for a cigar box on the shelf behind-- Lying open, an old pistol inside of it
Young Otis reaches-- Frowning as he senses something wrong-- Wade levels his gun at Young Otis's back, then turns to wink at Hollis like he did before he shot Eladio-- ' Finger closing around the trigger of the 45-- Mouth open in horror-- Eyes burning as he aims-- Stepping in the door, seeing,  -- Turning to see Buddy-- bullet plows through his neck, knocking him back against the bar
His gun falls from his hand-- Horrified, splattered with the Sheriff's blood -- Twenty-dollar bills have spilled out of the envelope and are soaking up blood-- Calm and hard-eyed
As he steps forward, we see his pistol is still in its holster
He reaches out and takes the
45 from Young Hollis's shaking hand, looks him in the eye till Hollis looks back, then looks toward Young Otis-- We  with his gaze to a - of Otis, back in the The  -- Sheriff Charley had some real big friends in politics then, and if the truth come out it wasn't going to go easy on Hollis
(He shrugs) don't know why  trusted Buddy with it--don't know why he trusted me
The first time  ever talked with him was right there, and then with a dead white man leakin' blood on the floor between us
He could charm the scales off a rattler, Buddy Deeds
This isn't what Sam was expecting
Hollis watches his face-- The three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under
Can't say  was much help
And the ten thousand
Widow's benefits
He figured it would make the disappearance look better, and that Mexican gal was just scrapin' by after Charley killed her man
They didn't get hooked up till late-- Time went on, people liked the story that we told better than anything the truth might have been
Sam swivels around on his seat to took at the spot where Charley fell
He has a lot of information to deal with-- What's the call, Sam
Sam rolls it over in his mind before answering-- Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have
Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it
Sam gets up-- Buddy's a goddamn legend
He can handle it
He heads for the door-- 'Night, fellas
Hollis and Otis watch him go-- : -,   -- We see Sam sitting on the hood of his car parked in the deserted drive-in lot, staring up at the ruined screen
Pilar's car rolls in, parks beside him-- Pilar gets out, kisses Sam, sits by him on the hood-- When's the picture start
Sam looks at her for a moment-- You gonna tell your mother we been seeing each other
She'll figure it out sooner or later
don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean
You have any idea when your father died
Eladio
(Shrugs) Couple months before  was born-- Try a year and a half
He bands her an old snapshot
looks at it-- Buddy and Young Mercedes on the lake
Buddy with his shirt off on one end of a sailboat, Mercedes in a bathing suit, both smiling for the camera-- Pilar hands the photo back to him, tries to be calm-- 've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before
Didn't know she owned one
Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county
Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry-- They can't pull this on me
It isn't fair-- don't believe this-- He paid the hospital bill when you were born
Your mom always calls you "our beautiful daughter" in the letters she wrote to him
From the first time  saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people  always felt like we were connected
remember thinking you were the one part of my life Buddy didn't have a piece of-- silence, both of them wondering what the next move should be-- So that's it
You're not going to want to be with me anymore
Sam knows what he feels but doesn't have the words-- 'm not having any more children
After Amado,  had some complications-- can't get pregnant again, if that's what the rule is about-- If  met you for the first time today, 'd still want to be with you
It is what Pilar needed to hear-- We start from scratch-- Yeah-- Everything that went before, all that stuff, that history--the hell with it, right
takes Sam's hand, kisses him-- Forget the Alamo
