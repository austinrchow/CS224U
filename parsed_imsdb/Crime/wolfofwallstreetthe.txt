And when you come from nothing, being rich means never having to go back to that
Jordan approaches , 20s, one of his guests

Oh wait, that was last month

Naomi winds up with the water glass
Jordan stands tall, puffs himself up, arms flexed at his sides

You're just lucky to have a husband who's in such great shape

Between her legs sits , their 5-month-old daughter
Hey, Skylar
(little girl voice) Good morning Daddy
Where's my kiss
Jordan kisses the baby, picks her up
62
The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 (playing along) Does Daddy get to kiss both his girls
Ohhh, no
Daddy doesn't even get to touch Mommy for a very, very long time
Naomi lays back on her elbows, thighs parted - she's wearing no panties
The wind goes out of Jordan
'mon, Nay, please
You know how sorry  am
swear -- (cutting him off) Daddy shouldn't waste his time
And from now on it's going to be nothing but short, short skirts around the house
And Mommy's so sick and tired of wearing panties, uhhh
In fact she's decided to throw them all away
(parting her thighs) So take a good look
You'll be seeing an awful lot of it around the house, but no touching
She licks her lips seductively
Jordan sets Skylar aside, starts grovelling
(') What's wrong, Daddy
Naomi slips her index finger in her mouth, starts sucking it
Jordan can barely speak
'mon, why are you doing this
said 'm sorry
(pouting) Ohhhh poor, poor Dada
He loves to say how wrong he is when he's ready to come in his own pants
Isn't that right Dada
Mommy loves Daddy so, so much and there's nothing she wants to do more right now than to make love to Daddy all day long
Well,  guess it's time for Daddy to be taught his first lesson
63
The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages     3/5/13 Naomi runs her fingers over her stomach and on to her inner thigh, then up toward her vagina
Jordan watches transfixed, then a change comes over him
wouldn't do that if  were you Mommy
think Mommy should hear a story before she decides to please herself like that
Can Daddy tell Mommy a story
(off her nod) And does mommy promise to keep her legs spread wide, wide open the whole time
(she nods dreamily) Good
Once upon a time there was a great big mansion in Long Island and the people who lived there had lots and lots of money
But of all the possessions they had, there was one thing that was much more valuable than all the rest combined, and that was their little baby daughter
Naomi listens, legs still spread, hand on her crotch
(') Now because he was very security- conscious, the Daddy hired two full-time guards, big hairy men both named Rocco, and they installed security cameras all around the house
And one of those cameras is right over Daddy's shoulder
Naomi's eyes widen -- she look toward a Teddy Bear on a shelf
that one of the eyes is a pinhole camera
(') So smile, Mommy
You're on Candid Camera

Good
Cuz we have a problem
He indicates out to the Bullpen
Donnie and Janet look
(incredulous) Is he wearing a bow tie
In the Bullpen   a young Stratton Broker in a bowtie cleaning a small goldfish bowl on his desk
He's got nothing better to do on the day of the biggest  in this firm's history

Oh
65
The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 Donnie nods, turns to go, but suddenly he turns back and thrusts his arm in the bowl, grabbing for the squirming goldfish
The Broker in a bowtie looks on, horrified
(') On new issue day
On cocksucking, motherfucking new issue day
Dozen of Brokers and Sales Assistants look over as Donnie snatches up the fish
Holding it by its tail, he jumps         * up on the desk of the Broker in a bowtie
Now the entire Bullpen looks over
(') This is what happens when you fuck with your pets on new issue day
With the flair of a showman, Donnie pops the fish in his mouth, swallowing it whole
The Brokers cheer wildly
Donnie jumps down, gets in the face of the Broker in a bowtie: (') Now take your bowtie, get your shit and get the fuck out
Bowtie is stunned
And as Donnie storms off, we on Jordan, watching from across the room

And as they ad lib greetings, settle in at the couch: (

excuse me
The place slowly comes to order
(') For those of you who don't know me, my name is Steve Madden
'm -- We know who you are
67
The Wolf of Wall Street    Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 Steve clears his throat, looks over at Jordan -- he's terrified
Jordan motions for him to calm down
uh, 'd like to start by telling you about my background in the shoe industry
Nice fucking hat
uh
first started working in the shoe industry, in a shoe store
When  was sixteen, my friends were out chasing girls, but  was learning about women's shoes
Move the mike closer
We can't fucking hear you
He moves the mic; feedback  through the bullpen
(') Sorry
Anyway, my first job was at a shoe store like  said where  worked in the stockroom
You know,  can honestly say 've been a lover of women's shoes since  was twelve-- #4 Freak
No
Heh-heh
Not like that
mean somehow  became fascinated with the endless design possibilities for women's shoes-- #5                         #6 Queer
Get a fucking life
Boos, hisses
Steve looks at Jordan, who motions for him to speed up
He grabs a shoe from one of the boxes
(') This shoe --    the Mary Lou -- is the one that    really put me on the map
It's a     black patent leather variation of    the Mary Jane, but-- half-eaten grapefruit lands at Steve's feet
In a flash, Jordan rushes over, grabs the mic-- 68
The Wolf of Wall Street    Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13 All right, let's hear it for Steve Madden and the wonderful Mary Lou
Huge applause, with stomping feet; howling, etc
(') Okay, now that you got that out of your system,  want you to know why Steve is so completely off the fucking wall
It's because this man is a creative genius
Steve's power, his gift -- is that he creates trends
Artists like Steve come along once a century
Elvis
Andy Warhol
Giorgio Armani
Who knows how high this stock could go
The 20s
The 50s
The 80s
Applause; war whoops
Jordan motions for quiet
(') want everybody to look down
See that little black box in front of you
It's called a telephone
Now 'm gonna let you in on a little secret about this telephone -- it won't dial itself
That's right -- until you take some action, it's nothing more than a worthless hunk of plastic, like a loaded M16 without a trained Marine to pull the trigger
And in the case of the telephone, it's the action of you, a highly trained Strattonite, a killer who will not take no for an answer
person who will not hang up the phone until his client either buys or fucking dies
The Brokers go crazy
Jordan looks around
(') don't care if you graduated from Harvard or Bumfuck University or never got past fourth fucking grade
That phone is the great equalizer
(pause; looks around) There is no nobility in poverty
've been rich, and 've been poor and  choose rich every time

Jordan takes off his  , flings it to the Crowd
Brokers go nuts, fighting over it like a home-run ball
(') And if anyone here thinks 'm crazy, get the fuck out and get a job at McDonald's, because that's where you fucking belong
But before you depart this room full of winners,  want you to take a good look at the person next to you, because one day in the not-so- distant future, you'll be sitting at a red light in your beat-up old Pinto, and that person's gonna pull up in a brand new Porsche, with their gorgeous young wife at their side
And who will you be next to
Some ugly beast with three days of razor-stubble in a sleeveless moo-moo, crammed in next to you with a carload of groceries from the fucking Price Club
He scans the Brokers; they're on the edge of their seats
(') So you listen to me and listen carefully
Are you behind on your credit card bills
Good
Pick up the phone and start dialing
Is your landlord threatening to evict you
Good
Pick up the phone and start dialing
Does your girlfriend think you're a fucking loser
Pick up the phone and start fucking dialing
want you to deal with your problems by becoming rich
want you to go out and spend money
Leverage yourself, back yourself into a corner, let the consequences of failure become so fucking unthinkable that you'll have no choice but to do whatever it takes to win
The Brokers go absolutely

The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 (') You have an obligation here, people

Names and addresses of every guest at my wedding
Friends, clients even threw in the seating chart
Heard that's why you wanted the video, figured this'd expedite whatever it is you're doing

know you're investigating Stratton but for the life of me  can't figure out why
Sure, my company is unorthodox; what brokerage isn't
Maybe we're a little louder than most but we don't do anything illegal
Talk to the , they'll tell you, they checked us out up and down
The 's actually a civil regulatory agency
We pursue criminal activity
That's what 'm saying
You guys take on real crime
Which is why 'm so curious: what do you think we did
The reason Jordan asked him here, Denham realizes
can't discuss ongoing investigations
understand
Though, to be frank, this case kinda got dumped on my desk
Some higher-up felt your shop needed looking into after all that press, fell on me to do the looking
You know who you should be looking at

If you want, 'll walk you through exactly -- -- that'd be great
And if there's anything you can give me just to close out your file, get it off my desk-- -- sure, get you back to the real criminals -- -- then we could both profit from this little sit-down
Jordan sizes him up: what did Denham mean by "profit"
You sure you don't want anything to drink
Water for your pal
(Denham demurs) Rumor is your started out in finance
Even got your broker's license before you joined the bureau
Who told you that
(searches his memory) Jeez, who was it
(comes up short) Ever regret it
Giving up the money-crazed, pin-striped life
Ever think where you'd be if you'd stuck with it
When 'm riding the subway home, sweating my balls off, in a suit 've worn three days, sure
Whattaya pull in working at the bureau, if you don't mind me asking
50-60K a year

We get a free handgun out of it, though, that doesn't suck

Way of the world
That's one thing  like about what do, the opportunity to make that right
Take this kid we had interning last year
Didn't want to be a broker, wanted to be an environmental scientist or something, he had a student loan debts up to his eyeballs
Anyway, his mom gets sick, all they can afford is third-rate care
Some of us got together, made an investment on his behalf and -- boom -- overnight everything changes, she's seeing the best doctors in the country
Sadly, didn't work out, she passed but still: having the power to do that makes all the other bullshit worth while
(as Denham considers that) See, it's all about proper guidance, Pat
Knowing someone with the right relationships, who's discreet
can change a life almost every day
They measure each other
How much that intern make off your deal
North of half a million
Denham summons Agent Hughes over
To Jordan: Can you say that again, what you told me
(Jordan declines with a smile; to Agent Hughes) believe Mr
Belfort just tried to bribe a federal officer
78
The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 What
was making conversation
Sounds like that to me, Jordan
no, no, no
sounded like that
no, to constitute a bribe, don't  have to make an explicit offer of money for services
With an exact dollar figure attached
All  said was "north" of half a million
According to the
Criminal Code, that dog won't hunt, Pat
(then) Heard you were a straight arrow
That you wouldn't bend the rules other agents might
He was right
You did a background check on me
Figured you were looking into me, was only fair
Plus you sail on a yacht fit for a Bond villain, sometimes you gotta act the part
This is why you invited me down to your yacht
With a couple hookers on it -- -- those are friends -- -- to get a sense of the guy who was coming after you
Jordan puts his hands up: "you got me
" Thanks for coming down
Now get off my boat

But you, you got this way all on your own
Good for you, Jordan

'm absolutely certain we'll see each other again

Just think what a hero 'll be in the office when the bureau seizes it
Jordan watches him go, temper flaring: he can't let Denham get the final word

You have a super ride home on the subway thinking about that

Untie me, shitbag

Jordan Belfort
At last
Nicholas has told me so much
Jordan, Jean-Jacques Saurel
Nice to make your acquaintance
This is some lobby you got
Ah, yes
We gave our designer an unlimited budget and he exceeded it
Come
You must tell me all about your adventure with the stewardess over coffee

- '  -                151 Jordan, Rugrat and Donnie drink coffee with Saurel and one other
It's an impressive office, with          * an enormous fish tank
We have a joke in America
"Heaven is a place where the police are Brits, the chefs are Italian, the car mechanics are German, the prostitutes are French and the bankers are Swiss
" never got it `til now -- look at those fucking fish
Come here, little guy
Yes, we have the same joke here
Only sometimes the English are chauffeurs and the chefs are French
The Germans, alas, are always mechanics; no one wants to grant them more authority than that
Polite laughter
Jordan, not as impressed by the fish, cuts straight to the point: 'm curious about your bank secrecy laws
Excusez-moi, Jordan, Swiss custom requires ten minutes of idle chit- chat before business can be discussed
(a smile) Of course, let's get "down to it
" What would you like to know
Under what circumstances would you be obligated to cooperate with an or
Justice Department investigation
Ca depend
Ca depend
Ca depend on what

The Wolf of Wall Street    Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 Whether America plans to invade Switzerland in the coming months
Want me to see if tanks are rolling down the Rue de la Croix
More chuckles
Through Jordan's forced smile: (
) What 'm asking, you Swiss dick, is are you going to fuck me over
(
) understand perfectly, you American shitheel
Saurel smiles
The only way the Banque Real de Geneve would cooperate with a foreign legal body is if the crime being pursued also happened to be a crime in Switzerland
But there are very few Swiss laws pertaining to your "rumored" improprieties
Which is why Mr
Azoff's joke is most appropriate: from a financial standpoint you are now in heaven, and we welcome you
If the
Justice Department or  or or  sent us a subpoena, it would become papier-toillette
We would wipe our ass with it
Everyone's impressed
Except Jordan
Unless it was an investigation into stock fraud -- which is a crime in Switzerland
Then you'd have to cooperate
(now he's impressed) Yes, we would
Assuming the account is under your name
However, if it were in the name of a nominee of yours
They take each other in

Yes

overwhelms Saurel's

So tell me about this plan of yours
'd like us to go to Switzerland tomorrow so you can open an account
'll fund it, and 'll pay you really well for your trouble
Oh my
86
The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13 Next month maybe you can fly to New York and we can start moving the cash
Moving the cash
(smiles) feel like a character in an Ian Fleming novel
It's all quite racy, isn't it
It is, and it's illegal too
Of course if you ever got in trouble, 'd come forward in two seconds, say  duped you, but even still
Risk is what keeps us young, isn't it darling
like that attitude
Promise me                      * you'll spend at least ten thousand pounds per month out of the account, okay
(chuckles) wouldn't even know how really do have everything  need
But  bet you don't have everything you want
How about a bigger apartment so your grandkids can sleep over
Aunt Emma notices that Jordan is sweating, fidgety
He's jonesing
Shall we sit
Sure, that'd be great
They sit on a nearby bench
After a while: Sometimes  wonder if you let money get the best of you, dear

Instantly, his chest and arm muscles swell to five times their size
Jordan goes to get his coke
He snarfs up two fat spoonfuls and -- like that -- his chest swells and he takes a deep breath and he dashes back to the rescue
Jordan rushes back to Donnie, who is now blue
(') He's not breathing
Jordan places his fingers over Donnie's artery
Nothing
(') Save him
Jordan kneels, starts furiously pumping Donnie's chest, breathing air into his lungs in rhythmic bursts
(
) This stupid sonovabitch
All Donnie ever did was fuck me up and now  had to save his life `cause took a  class when the baby was learning to swim
Just for the record,  want it noted: not for a second did  even think about letting him choke to death, even though it would've saved me an awful lot of headaches
Donnie still isn't breathing
Jordan flips him over, tries the Heimlich -- we hear a  as he breaks Donnie's ribs
He flips him back over, but he's almost completely blue

One last try
Jordan takes a massive breath, blowing as hard as he can into Donnie's lungs

Donnie coughs, vomiting

The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 You'd have to walk away

It's truly with a heavy heart that  tell you that day is here

Jordan notices a few Brokers gravely shaking their heads
(') And the fact that 'm gone won't stop me from giving Donnie advice, not that he needs any-- (jumping in) Why would anyone in their right mind not follow 's advice
Donnie looks petrified; he's used to being an offensive tackle, not the quarterback
Before  go, there's something want to remind you all, and that's this -- Stratton Oakmont is bigger than any one person, even me
Especially me
You guys are Stratton, each and every one of you, and that is why it's sure to remain the best brokerage firm in the fucking world
Thunderous applause spreads through the boardroom, all 300 Brokers on their feet
on Jordan
(') See, the very idea of Stratton is that when you come here and step into this bullpen for the first time, you start your life anew
You have a place here and no one can take that away from you
Stratton Oakmont is America
Give me your tired and poor
The very moment you walk through that door and pledge your loyalty to this firm, you become part of a family, you become a Strattonite
It doesn't matter who you are, it doesn't matter where you're from
Whether your family came over on the Mayflower or on a fucking inner tube from Haiti

Hoots and hollers
He raises his hand for quiet
(') In case any of you weren't aware of it, Kimmie was one of Stratton's first brokers, one of the original twenty
Now when most of you met Kimmie, you met her the way she is today -- a beautiful woman who drives a brand new Mercedes, a woman who lives in the finest condo complex on Long Island
woman who wears $3000 Armani suits, who spends her winters in the Bahamas and her summers in the Hamptons
Wild applause
(') But that's not the Kimmie  met
The Kimmie  met was broke, a single mom on the balls of her ass
Three months behind on her rent with an eight year old son
She came to me for a job and when hired her she asked for a $5000 dollar advance so she could pay his tuition
And what did  do, Kimmie
You wrote me a check for $25,000
Because  believed in you, like believe in each and every one of you
love you, Jordan
As the Brokers go berserk, Jordan stands basking in the adoration
He looks at Donnie, turns back to the Crowd, looks out at the faces
change has come over him
He stands there, thinking
An eternity, then: 108
The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 You know for years 've been telling you guys not to take no for an answer, to keep pushing, to not hang up the phone till you get what you want
This deal 'm about to sign, barring me from the securities industry, barring me from Stratton, my home
