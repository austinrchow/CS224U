" " Screenplay by Joel Coen and Ethan Coen Based on the 1955 movie "The Ladykillers" by William Rose - Specifically, a garbage scow
We see it from  , chugging down the placid but mighty Mississippi
Head credits play over  of the garbage scow
No sound, except for an incongruously heroic score
The  is a little rough, coarse-grained; along with the overbearing score it almost suggests an industrial film rather than a feature
One piece of sound -- the toot of the boat's horn -- is obviously library
And not a new library either
The garbage scow passes under a bridge spanning the broad, sluggish waters, and proceeds on to its landfill, a steaming river island
Disturbed gulls and other scavenger birds rise from where they were picking through trash
Their squawks, like the boat horn, are not quite believable as
The head credits end as the anthemic music resolves
,  - lies on the weather-grayed and -roughened planking of a front porch
The porch is half-shaded from the noonday sun
It is quiet except for the chirr of heat bugs, close by, and, very distant, many voices in chorus, engaged in divine worship in a Baptist church sufficiently far away that vagaries of breeze fan them in and out of audibility
We once again hear the toot of the scow's horn, distant now and played as real, not slapdash effect
At this, the dog lifts his nose to catch the breeze, sniffs, and then, whining, lowers his head to the floor and covers his snout with his forepaws
He huffs briefly and goes to sleep
We   to show that the dog is sleeping before the Your source for worms, lures, etcetera, etcetera
We     that the modest one-story structure houses two establishments; its other front door leads to the campaign sign in the window on the municipal side shows a black man of late middle-age beaming and giving the viewer a thumbs-up: -   /He Is Too Old to Go to Work
- We hear snoring on top of a low, steady hissing sound
We are  toward the door of the lock-up, which stands open
The small cell is empty, its bed neatly made
We are  slowly around a jailer's key on a ring that hangs from a nail
The  snoring and whirring continues
The '   now makes the light catch a spider web spun between the key and the wall
We  across the face of the radio
The peaceful steady hissing jumps in louder at the : it is uninterrupted: a transmissionless, crimeless, misdemeanorless idle radio hiss
The snoring is also louder here
As we   the radio we are   a pair of feet propped up on the desktop
They belong to  , tipped back in his chair, fingers laced on his chest, head lolling forward
As the     on him, there is the ring of a telephone -- muffled, not present
It nevertheless rouses the sheriff who almost strangles on a snore as he awakes, and then rocks forward to pick up his phone
Sheriff Wyner
The muffled ringing continues; the sheriff looks, puzzled, at the phone
Now the ringing stops and we hear a muffled voice next door: (
) Worms
The sheriff replaces the phone, leans back again, adjusts his hat, and is about to go back to sleep when we hear the front door open
The sheriff looks and reacts with genuine, if momentary, fear
He manages to compose himself and give the intruder a smile: Afternoon, Miz Munson
Entering is an elderly black woman in a floral print dress and fruited bonnet
Afternoon, Sheriff
You know the Funthes boy
Mackatee Funthes
No no, WeeMack
Mackatee's eldest
Oh yeah, believe  do
Well, he's a good boy but he done gone down to the Costco in Pascagoula and got hisself a blastah -- and he been playin' that music
Wyner is not sure where this is going: Uh-huh
Loud
Well-- "Left my wallet in El Segundo
" He-- Songs like that
Uh-huh
Hippity-hop music
could-- You know they call it hippity-hop music, but it don't make me wanna go hippity-hop
No ma'am-- And Othar don't like that music neither
Sheriff Wyner now displays an exaggerated solicitousness: It's been disturbin' Othar then, has it
How could it help but do
That kind of music
You know what they call colored folks in them songs
Have you got any idea
don't think -- don't wanna say the word
won't say it twice, 'll tell you that
say it one time
Yes ma'am
In the course a swearin' out my complaint
Yes'm-- Two thousand years after Jesus
Thirty years after Martin Luther King
The age of Montel
Sweet lord a-mercy, izzat where we at
Mm-mm-- WeeMack down to Pascagoula buyin' a big thumpy stereo player
So he can listen to that word in the house next to mine
Sheriff, you gotta help that boy
Help him
You gotta take an innarest that helpin' hand
(dubious) Well, we're here to help
Well God bless ya
Don't wanna be tried and found wantin'
No ma'am
Many many tunkalow parzen, Sheriff Wyner
Many many tunkalow parzen
Many what ma'am
You have been tried and found wanting
Don't want that writin' on the wall
No ma'am-- Feast a Balthazar
Mm-hm
John The Apostle said: Behold there is a stranger in our midst, come to destroy us
Yes ma'am
- Mrs
Munson closes the door behind her
She wags a paper fan and mutters: He's a good man
Just needs instruction
Dog, you in peoples' way
The dog stirs with a whine and ambles off
- With a neatly tended garden
It is the last house on a street of other similarly modest but well maintained homes; beyond it the street disappears down a bluff
The empty space beyond suggests a wide river, and indeed we can see the top of an anchored, gaudily painted paddle-boat poking over the rise
The paddle-boat is apparently anchored at the near bank of the river
Mrs
Munson is entering by the gate
She stops in the garden and stoops to pull a tiny weed marring the otherwise perfect row of flowers
/
-  - Mrs
Munson lets herself in
cat lopes up to her, the bell around its neck tinkling, and leans mewing into her leg
You need somethin' to eat, Angel
-  - Mrs
Munson hand-cranks a can opener around a tin of cat food
Mm
gizzards
The cat paces back and forth between her legs, leaning into them and purring, responding to the snap of tin as the cover comes off the can
The can contains cubed processed gizzard in a gelatinous medium like the stuff that clings to gefilte fish
-   - Above the fireplace is an oil portrait of a serious-looking black man of late middle-age with a neatly groomed mustache starting to gray
couple of candles sit on the mantel below the portrait, giving it the semblance of a shrine
Mrs
Munson enters and lights the candles
Othar,  went'n complained about WeeMack,  hope it'll do some good
That boy hangin' by a thread
Over the pit
Fiery pit
" Left My Wallet in El Segundo"
She shakes out the match and sits in a rocker and takes up her knitting
As she sits she gives an audible groan
Sixty-seven years of life, forty- six years of marriage, you mean to tell me you never one time suffered from piles
It's the human condition, most humans anyway
Like that ball player said: world's got two kinds of folks -- them that's got piles and them that's gonna get 'em
But you was always healthy as an ox
There is the distant moan of a riverboat horn
Passed on before you got piles
Mmmmhmm
Thank the Lord you wasn't sick
You don't wanna sicken 'n die
No, you wanna pass nice 'n peaceful
go to sleep one night, wake up in the glory land
woof
gust of wind hums under the eaves; the candles below the portrait flicker
As Mrs
Munson looks around the room, vaguely towards the ceiling, sensing a negative aura, the cat arches its back and hisses
At this moment the doorbell rings
Well who's that now, Pickles
She grunts as she hoists herself out of the chair
/
-  - She opens the door-- draft-- -   - The candles below the portrait of Othar go out, sending up thin wisps of smoke
/
-  - The cat shrieks and bolts out the door, past the man on the stoop:   ,
He is a middle-aged Southern gentleman wearing a panama hat and a cape over a cream-colored suit
He has dark circles under his eyes
The smile he attempts, mournful yet courtly, is wiped away by: Ma'am
Go get 'im
do beg your pardon
Go get Pickles,  didn't let 'im out
(tasting the name) Pickles
- Dorr walks down the stoop followed by the old lady
Oh, he's up the tree again
Your gonna have to shimmy on up
am so terribly sorry, madam
But won't the feline eventually tire of his lonely perch and, pining for his master's affection, return on his own initiative
Huh
No, he won't come down less you fetch him
He'd set there til Gabriel blows his horn if someone didn't shimmy up
Up with you now
Well then couldn't we perhaps offer him kitty treats and enticements, or if not foodstuffs perhaps squeaky little toys of the kind formerly manufactured in Hong Kong but now produced in the other so-called "Little Tigers"
His fingers form the quotes
of the Pacific Rim
The point bein', do we have to actually ascend the tree-- Look,  don't want no doubletalk
If you ain't gonna fetch him down guess  gotta call the po-lice
Police
His face darkens
They ain't gonna be happy
Every time they come fetch him down they swear they won't do it no more
Dorr casts his hat aside and starts awkwardly climbing the tree
He gasps as he climbs: No need to call the authorities did this often as a youth -- why, was a positive lemur
Here, kitty
The cat backs away down a branch, arching its back and hissing
Don't upset him, now
Dorr, on his stomach, inches after the cat, grunting: wouldn't dream of it
harmless little felix domesticus
Come to The branch breaks, hinging down to slam Dorr face-first into the trunk, from where he drops the rest of the way to the ground
-   - Othar's portrait, upside-down, seems to be looking bemusedly down on us
An   shows Dorr lying on the couch, a damp washcloth on his forehead, eyes rolled back to look at the picture
Mrs
Munson is entering with a cup of tea
Dorr swings his feet out to sit up and accept the tea
thank you, madam, for your act of kindness
Well you let him out
certainly did and  do apologize no end
Allow me to present myself, uh, formally: Goldthwait Higginson Dorr, Ph
What, like Elmer
Beg your pardon, ma'am
Fudd
No no, Ph
is a mark of academic attainment
It is a degree of higher learning bestowed, in my case, in recognition of my mastery of the antique languages of Latin and Greek
also hold a number of other advanced degrees including the baccalaureate from a school in Paris, France, called the Sorbonne
Munson chuckles
Sore bone, well  guess that's appropriate
You ever study at Bob Jones University
have not had that privilege
It's a bible school, only the finest in the country
send them five dollars every month
That's very gener-- 'm on their mailing list
'm an Angel
Indeed
They list my name in the newsletter, every issue
got the literature here, you wanna examine it
Perhaps when my head has recovered from its
buffeting
Mrs
Munson, are you at all curious as to why darkened your door, as the expression has it, on this lovely camelia-scented morn
was wondering, til you let Pickles out
Then in all the excitement-- quite understand
The fact is that saw the sign on your window advertising a room to let, and it is the only such sign among the houses of this charming, charming street
Yeah,  got a room
'm lookin' for a quiet tenant
Fifteen dollars a week quite understand
Madam, you are addressing a man who is quiet -- and yet not quiet, if  may offer a riddle
He sets down the teacup and rises
Perhaps you can show me the room, Mrs
Munson, and allow me to explain
Well you can see the room, but don't like double-talk
Mrs
Munson precedes him
-  - up the stairs
You see, madam,  am currently on sabbatical from the institution where teach -- the University of Mississippi at Hattiesburg
am taking a year off to indulge my passion --  don't believe that is too strong a word -- for the music of the Renaissance
perform in -- and have the honor of directing -- a period instrument ensemble that performs at Renaissance fairs and other cultural fora
- '  - They enter a small bedroom
There is a small bed on a brass frame, a chair, a wash basin, and cheerful yellow chintz drapes on the window
Dorr appreciatively takes it in
thoo-out central and southern Mississippi
We perform on the instruments for which the music was originally composed, in the belief that
that
Why, this is lovely
Wait a minute
You got some kind of band
Dorr once again wiggles quotes with his fingers: The word "band" would be, in this context, something of an anachronism
Though we do play together -- hence the word "ensemble" -- the nature of the music is such that one would hesitate to apply the epithet "band" with its connotations of jangling rhythm and ear-popping amplification
So you don't play hippity-hop, " Left My Wallet in El Segundo," songs with the titles spelt all funny
Madam,  shudder
quake
The revulsion  feel for modern popular music, and all other manifestations of contemporary decay, is,  have no doubt, the equal of y'own
Why, we play music that was composed to the greater glory of God
Devotional music
Church music
Gospel music
Well-inspired by the gospels, certainly
The vintage, of course, is no more recent than the Rococo
Rococo, huh
Well,  guess that'd be okay
But  certainly don't propose to inflict our rehearsals on you
May enquire -- do you have a root cellar
-  - Dorr ducks while descending the steep, narrow stair in order to avoid an overhead beam
He is followed by Mrs
Munson
Yes, yes, yes, this looks promising
He pulls on a hanging string to light a bare bulb overhead
Little dank, ain't it
Oh, indeed, but that only improves the acoustics
He experimentally claps his hands
Marvelous
These earthen walls are ideal for baffling the higher registers of the, uh, lute and, uh, sackbutt
That's why so much music of the cinquecento was played in crypts and catacombs
Yes, this will do nicely
He dry-washes his hands with enthusiasm, but his tone remains mournful
This is perfect
This is more than perfect
can scarcely contain my glee
You containing it okay
He starts to peel cash out of a large, well-worn billfold: Allow me to pay you a week in advance
Allow me to pay you two weeks in advance
Allow me to pay you a month in advance
cannot countenance the thought of these charming apartments being tenanted by someone unappreciative of their special je ne sais quoi
That would be a shame
- On the cart is a boombox
It is playing " Left My Wallet in El Segundo
" It is being pushed through a casino empty of customers
As the cart stops and a wastebasket is emptied into it: (
) You gotta peel this shit out sticks to the bottom
shows two youngish black men in the khaki uniforms of custodians
Emptying the wastebasket is - He is instructing
You wouldn't believe this shit, sometimes even out here on the casino floor you gonna find sanitary napkin shit stuck there, Tucks,  don't know what the fuck people do while they're gambling here man
ain't peelin' funky shit with my human hands, man
That's a prescription for disease and viruses and shit, attackin' y'insides
As they roll on we see more of the gambling floor, which is on something less than the scale of a Las Vegas casino
The floor is not yet open and dealers stack and count chips at the tables, pit bosses with clipboards looking over their shoulders
Other dealers strap on visors and sleeve garters, preparing to work
You gotta do it
Mr
Gudge checks everything
Man is a motherfuck
Shit -- looka this
After a furtive look around he plucks a chip from the next wastebasket and slips it in his pocket
You keep an eye out, man
found a hundred-dollar chip once
Fuck that, man
ain't pawin' through used Tucks for a fi' dollar chip
said it was a hundred
Man, your guts gonna turn to soup'n leak outcha fuckin' asshole
The cart jitters loudly on the dimpled plastic floor
This tunnel leads back onto land
To the office for all the people work for Mannex
Mannex Corporation
Owns the Lady Luck 'n three other boats
-   - The two men are entering a windowless fluorescent-lit office area
row of wooden office doors and one heavy steel door
This is where they think on their corporate shit, Gudge and them
He stops to empty a wastebasket
The lights is ugly but it ain't as many Tucks
He bangs on the steel door: , motherfuck
Lemme in
(
) What's the password
Kiss my ass
We hear a deep chuckle and the door, steel reinforced, swings open
-   - The two men enter, WeeMack nodding at the security man ()
This is where they count the dough
You try to take any of it Elron there shoot your ass
Again the security man chuckles
WeeMack picks up some fast- food wrappers
This place is a fuckin' pigsty
You a pig, man, nothin' but a squeaky ol' motherfuckin' pig
Elron chuckles
He is an enormously fat man; his chuckles come from deep, deep in his chest
You got fuckin' Kocoa Krispies in ya uniform man, still got breakfast there and you eatin' motherfuckin' lunch
Elron uses one hand to swipe crumbs off his uniform shirt, chuckling
You a disgrace before motherfuckin' God
Elron chuckles
You a motherfuck-- oh, hello Mr
Gudge, how we be this mornin'
man in a buttoned white shirt nods at him
Funthes
How's the new man
He is a cleaning motherfucker, man
Is that a fact
-    - It is a ruin of a field; charred trees point bare and gnarled limbs toward a gray sky; smoke drifts across the desolate waste
Something is bounding towards us from the deep background
We   as it approaches: a bulldog, running avidly toward us on its stumpy little legs
An  male voice ( ): (
) One, Mountain
There is an explosion that showers dirt in front of the dog and makes it veer
Something strapped around the dog's neck bounces as he runs
Scrub two
Scrub three
Four, Mountain
Another explosion makes the dog veer back so that it once again bears on us
The thing that has been bouncing around its neck flies off
Our    has brought us to ground level just as the dog arrives in front of us to feed at a dog food bowl in the foreground
The yellow plastic bowl has a -Ration logo facing us
We hear another  voice (): (
) Cut, goddamnit
His canteen fell off
The Director's feet enter in the foreground
He hooks the dogs belly with one foot and hoists it roughly away from the bowl
We : The
He scowls down at the animal
Props
man in a Hemingway field-jacket with multiple pockets, and also a loaded utility belt, trots up toward him, his belt jangling as he runs
This is
Pancake is a florid beer-bellied man in his late fifties
He has a full blond-grey Grizzly Adams beard and wears multi- pocketed shorts that form an ensemble with his Hemingway jacket
The director is angry
The goddamn thing's canteen fell off
It would have been a good take
Pancake is unperturbed
Okay
Okay
We're prepared for that
He hits a button on the radio on his belt and talks into his headset: Mountain, bring Otto with the apparatus
He strains at his lead, muscling forward as quickly as his minder and his own stumpy little legs will allow
He peers through the two goggly eyeholes of an antique leather gas mask, its pignose breathing apparatus covering his own snout
His phlegmy breathing is amplified by the device
We   the lead to show his minder,
She is a solid woman in her late forties with freckles beginning to merge into age spots
Her long straw-colored hair is tightly braided into Heidi pigtails bound with red ribbon
Otherwise her dress is unadorned
The director squints at the dog
What the hell is this
Pancake's manner is professorial: World War  vintage gas mask
It's authentic
Strapped on, of course, so it can't fall off
The animal is free to be as active as he wants, doesn't inhibit his movement, and think it really sells the whole doughboy thing-- It looks like a fucking joke
Pancake stares at the director for a moment and, though not doing anything, makes a sound of concentrated effort: Nnnnrnff
The director squints at him: What
Pancake comes out of his trance, or whatever it was: No, nothing, uh
you're absolutely right, the gas mask is a whimsical concept-- How the hell does it eat when it gets to the Kennel Rations
The dog looks up from person to person as each speaks, twisting its neck to peer through the eyeholes
Its breathing is growing louder
Well, you're absolutely right- Don't let the client see this
Of course not, that would be inappropriate-- Or the Humane fucker
No no-- The dog gets down on its knees, slowly, like a camel, breathing ever more loudly
They'll shut the fucking spot down, Pancake
Put the goddamn canteen back on
That says he's a soldier
Dented tin canteen
Just tie the damn thing to his collar
The dog flops over into the mud
Easiest thing in the world
just thought -- but the canteen is much better
Good concept
Let's go with that-- What's he doing
The dog has started to convulse
Well, he's uh
Just breathe normally, Otto
The fucking dog can't breathe
Oh, he can breathe, that thing is -- just breathe normally, Otto
The dog's breath is rasping and horrible
The fucking dog cannot breathe
Get that fucking thing off him
Of course
Easiest thing in the world
He stoops and fiddles at the straps
It's on good and tight, , uh
Just breathe normally, Otto
He starts thumping at his pockets
Get the fucking thing off him
Don't have my Leatherman
Mountain
Give me your Leatherman
Chop chop
Get the fucking thing off him
Chitra, make sure the Humane fucker doesn't come over here
Bring him to craft services
As he makes to scoop up the dog: Good idea
Ice water, treats- Not the dog, you idiot
The Humane fucker
Distract him
Right
Of course
He goes back to work on the mask
Oh my god, he's bleeding
No, that's me --  -- the Leatherman
here we go
His hand gouting blood, he finally manages to get the gas mask off
crowd is starting to gather and gape
The director barks at a grip: Put up a couple solids here -- don't want the client seeing this
Pancake thumps on the inert dog's chest
Come on, Otto
Otto is fucking dead
Mountain, have electric run me a stinger
Don't give up on me, Otto
Mountain,  need two live leads
More people crowd in to look
Clark, the gennie's a hundred yards away
Goddamnit
Otto's gonna have brain damage in about ninety seconds
Okay
He pulls the dog's lips back, exposing its teeth and slobbered tongue
Kiss of life
He sucks in a deep breath and starts mouth-to-mouthing the beast
- We are looking out from inside a football helmet; we hear the super-present breathing of the helmet's occupant
Just over the breathing we can hear the muffled shouting of a snap count
We are in a crouch position looking downfield
At the call of "Hike
" we and everyone on the field spring into action
We sprint downfield, the breathing becoming even louder very big person downfield is sprinting toward us
After several yards, still on the move, we  quickly around to look back for the quarterback
Barely visible among converging bodies, he is releasing the football toward someone else
Easing up on the run we   around to look downfield just as the oncoming defender is upon us and --  -- slams into us
leaves us looking up at the sky
Our loud breathing has stopped
After a long beat the breathing resumes with a raggedy labored inhale
It continues irregularly
Another helmeted player appears above us to peer down into our helmet
He extends a hand to help us up
We are looking back and forth around the circle at our gathered teammates
Delta thirty-seven
On four
All, with a simultaneous hand clap: Huh
Lined up opposite us is a snarling defender
Once again, over loud breathing, we can just hear the shouted count
At "Hike
" we straighten to meet the defensive lineman lunging at us
His mouthpiece clatters against ours and in horrific - he strains against us, his animal gurgles of effort audible over our own ragged breath
With a primal roar from the defenseman our  tips back and up,   to stop with a  against the ground, staring up
Once again our breathing has stopped
After a beat a foot is planted on our helmet as a looming running back steps on us in his charge downfield
He is pursued by defenders some of whom leap over us and some of whom by the sound of it step on various body parts
The same back-and-forth
Okay, Epsilon twenty-two
You the man
Hey
This brings our wandering attention  back to the quarterback: You the man
very, very present  (): (
) Me the man
Huh
The same breathing and count
On "Hike
" we sprint downfield
The same distant defender sprinting toward us
We hear low but very present a dismayed: (
) Unh
oh no
Our breathing is torn by rasping wheezes of effort as we continue to run
We look back
Every player is looking directly at us
huge spiralling football coming at us -- too close, too soon -- and-- It bounces off our mouth guard and flies up
(
) shit
We are looking forward just as We are hit by the defender
We once again land face-up
Very steeply , right over us, we see the defender juggling the live ball
With a moan, our own hand reaches weakly up towards the ball and the high, distant defender
He finally gathers in the ball and securely tucks it, and starts back upfield
We climb wearily to our feet
We look back upfield just in time to see the defender start an elaborate victory dance in the end zone
He pauses for a moment to point a gloved hand directly at us, then resumes his strut
Shouting from the sidelines brings our  attention over
The coach, face twisted with fury, is shouting at us and using his clipboard to wave us off the field
We trot toward the sidelines
All of our teammates stare at us - some in shock, some in anger, some in pity
At the sideline bench our  swings round as we seat ourself
hand reaches up to the mouth guard to pull off the helmet and we : Our first   as the player () finishes pulling off his helmet
He is a big blond boy
His entire body, including his face, is solidly built
An offscreen Voice: (
) Hudson
The boy, Hudson, turns to look, and we cut to one last The  is striding up, swinging his clipboard at the camera: with a loud
it brings on: - / -  - It is a typical sunbaked concrete strip mall with a Seven- Eleven, a launderette, and a Hi-Ho Donut
The Hi-Ho Donut sign shows a pink donut with sprinkles and says in much smaller lettering: And Croissants
beat-up Impala pulls into the lot, pulsing hip-hop music
After a long rumbling idle the ignition is killed
Both front doors open
Two   get out and look around with a manner that is if anything too casual
-  - There is faint muzak and loud air-conditioner hum
Glass cases display donuts identified as , , and
Fancies ooze yellow goo
The jelly on the jelly donuts is developing a crust of age
The glazed also look moth-eaten
One customer, a disheveled older man, sits at one of the little formica tables staring into a coffee cup
Next to the coffee is a brown paper bag from which a straw protrudes
Behind the counter is a middle-aged   in a neat white blouse
The two youths enter pulling out enormous handguns from underneath their windbreakers
#1 All right Dragon Lady, give us all the fuckin' money
The woman stares blankly
#1 We want that donut money
Yao gin nyap
man appears from the kitchen in back
He is a middle-aged Vietnamese gentleman in a crisply pressed khaki leisure suit
An ascot is knotted at his neck
He wears aviator eyeglasses
In his mouth smolders a half-burned-down filterless cigarette
This, we shall learn later, is
#2 Okay papa-san, we want that donut money
#1 And we ain't fuckin' around, Mr
Hi- Ho
Hi-Ho
The two youths look at her briefly
Nothing else is forthcoming
The drunk looks up from his paper bag
#2 Look, this fuckin' thing, it ain't complicated
You give us all the fuckin money, you don't get shot in the head, you make more donuts, get more money
That's how it works, see
The General stares at him
As with his wife, none of it seems to register; unlike his wife, he seems unperturbed
#1 Give us the money
He is pointing the gun directly at the General's head
#1 You got three fuckin' seconds
You understand one-two-three
'm gonna count one-two-three and then shoot
Okay
Three sec- huh
The General has swung his fist up to hook two fingers inside the youth's nostrils
His gun clatters to the floor
The fingers are way, way up his nose
Only one knuckle shows on each finger
The youth is staring cross-eyed at his own nose
His friend is also stupefied
#1 (very nasal) His fingers are way the fuck up my nose
#2 '
The General still impassively sucks on his cigarette
The first youth is on the verge of tears: #1 think they're in my brain, man
#2 He raises his gun to start firing
As he does so the General uses his hook-hold on the other youth's nose to slam his head backwards, down into some Fancies
The door opens and a customer walks in, a semi-elderly lady with a cane
Youth #2, eyes rolling, wildly swings to cover the door, then back to the General who has his friend's head pressed into the Fancies, then uncertainly over to the Vietnamese woman who is loudly yelling at him in Vietnamese
Cigarette still dangling from his lower lip, the General calmly plucks a pot of coffee from the coffee warmer and tosses it into Youth #2's face
Youth #2 screams
-  - The car is still pulsing hip-hop music
Youth #2 stumbles out of the Hi-Ho, hands covering his face and sinks to his knees
-  - The General now has the first youth's face pressed into the Fancies from behind
Without disturbing his smoking, the General repeatedly kicks the youth in the ass
His wife, muttering irritably in Vietnamese, is wheeling a water bucket and mop to where the floor is covered with coffee
- At the  many voices are swelling in a song of worship
It is a black Baptist church, and the music has great energy
The white-robed choir finishes singing; a preacher takes the podium
know you all remember that when Moses came down the mountain, carrying the word a God, come down that Sinai peak, he caught those Israelites red- handed
What he catch 'em doin'
He caught 'em worshipping a golden calf
Shouts of "That's right
" He caught 'em with their backs turned on God
More shouts of "That's right
" He caught 'em worshipping a God
God of  things
He caught them Israelites in
"He caught 'em
" Because backslidin' is , brothers and sisters
You hear talk these days, and  know you've heard this talk, you hear talk of , well all that means is we done turned our back on God
"That's right
" People say civilization doin' this, civilization doin' that, civilization in
Well it ain't no civilization
It ain't no them
It's , brothers and sisters
"Amen
" We are  among the congregants, disproportionately women, mostly of middle age and elderly, mostly wearing elaborate go-to-church hats
It's what's in our hearts, each and every one of us when we like them Israelites
Slidin' awa-a-a-ay down that Godly slope, slippin' and slidin' toward the mire and muck a the stinkhole of greed -- that's "That's decline
" The   brings us onto Mrs
Munson, wearing, like most of her peers, an oversized hat; hers is adorned with a great deal of plastic fruit
And what did Moses do when he saw those declinin' backslidin' never- mindin' sinners
"What he do
" Moses  those sinners in his wrath yes he did
"Yes he did
" 'all know what smote is
smite
You smite
He smites
We done smote
"That's right
" To smite is to go  the head
"Uh-huh
" Because sometimes, brothers and sisters, that is the  way
"Yes it is
" To smite is to reMIND
We got to that decline
And scramble back to the face a the almighty Gyod
"Amen
" 'Stead a worshippin' that calf, that earthly  on that island
That  island in that shadowland  outside the Kingdom a God
"Way outside
" That  island where scavenger birds feast on the bones a the backslidin' damned
"Yes they do
" And so, let us pray
- It is a white clapboard country church
The preacher stands at the door chatting with the congregants filing out
#1 You preach a wonderful sermon, Brother Cleothus
Why thank you, Sister Rose
That man has a lot to say
#1 Yes he does
And every word of it the truth
#2 Mm-mm
Jesus well pleased with him
#3 Deed he is
Oh now ladies
#3 Pleased as he can be
#1 Mm-mm
Stout, too
#1 Mm-mm
Oh now you gracious ladies
-  - Mrs
Munson is at the kitchen table
She folds a five dollar bill into a sheet of paper, raising her voice as she does so: It was a good sermon
That man has a lot to say
-   - We have  to the portrait of Othar over the mantel
He does not answer
From the kitchen: '  (
) Stout, too
It would've been a comfort to you
-  - Mrs
Munson has stuffed the paper-enclosed bill into an envelope, which she is now laboriously addressing to Bob Jones University
And the choir was all in good voice
Mm-mm- There is a knock at the door
Who could that-- The cat yowls and hisses
/
-  - As Mrs
Munson swings open the door
Dorr stands on the stoop mournfully dry-washing his hands and obsequiously ducking his head
My dear Mrs
Munson,  do so hope this is not an inopportune time for our first practice-- Somebody die
beg your-- Oh
He looks back at the long black vintage Lincoln hearse parked at the curb behind him
No no, no bereavement, though it is so kind of you to enquire
No, the hearse is simply a vehicle commodious enough to accommodate all of the members of our ensemble
And of course our instruments, contrived in an age ignorant of miniaturization
He turns and gestures at the vehicle
At his sign, Gawain, the custodian, emerges from the driver's side
Clark Pancake emerges from the front passenger side
The General, wearing a different but equally pressed khaki suit and ascot, and with a smoking cigarette in his lips, emerges from a back door
Gawain goes to the back of the hearse and opens its hatch to let out Lump Hudson, the football player
Lump helps unload five large and oddly shaped instrument cases, each man taking one except for Lump himself, who carries two
As the parade of losers and misfits winds its way up the walk: Let me introduce you to my friends, my colleagues, these devoted and passionate musicians
This is Gawain MacSam, our bassoonist
Gawain nods as he passes by
General Nguyen Pham Doc, viola da gamba
No smoking in this house
The General tosses his cigarette away and bows stiffly as he passes
So sorry
Clark Pancake -- a multi- instrumentalist, but with his remarkable embosser Clark specializes in wind instruments, and is especially accomplished on the French horn
He nods, passes
And, finally, Aloysius "Lump" Hudson
Lump is our sackbuttist and -- thank you, Lump --  see you've also brought my fiddle
As he hands Dorr the violin case: Here's your fiddle, Doctor
Mrs
Munson sizes up the group
You ain't gonna make a racket, are ya
Oh no
Oh no no no no no
No, we shall recuse ourselves to the basement where we shall be --  think here the expression is uniquely appropriate
He gives a sickly smile
as quiet as the crypt
Hmph
-  - The General stands stock still, his nose an inch away from the earthen wall, studying it, squinting through the smoke of the cigarette pinched between his lips
The rest of the men are opening their cases and taking out the instruments
Gawain's case contains, however, not a musical instrument but a boombox and several tapes
He loads one of the tapes into the machine
What do you think, General
Present any problems
After a beat the General turns away from the wall to give Dorr a look into which one might read anything, or nothing
Gawain hits play on the boombox and the cellar is filled with the fussy strains of baroque chamber music
Dorr nods
Good then
He spreads a map open on the sackbutt case
All right, gentlemen, why don't we all crowd around and go over the plan
The biggest feature on the map is a wavy, roughly north-south pair of lines: a river
boat icon sits at one edge and from it a dotted rectangle extends inland
Dorr taps at the boat icon with his fiddle bow
This, gentlemen, is the Lady Luck, gambling den, cash cow, Sodom of the Mississippi delta -- and the focus of our little exercise
Here is Orchard Street
He is tracing a street that parallels the dotted rectangle extending from the boat
The street is lined by small house icons on either side; the bow comes to rest on one of those icons
and here is the residence of Marva Munson, the charming lady whom y'all met moments ago
Gentlemen
Bow taps emphasize: You
are
here
Now
This brings us to this square
The bow indicates it, and then withdraws
Dorr uses the bow as a swagger stick to punctuate as he begins to pace
Gentlemen,  believe you are all aware that the Solons of the State of Mississippi, to wit, its legislature, have decreed that no gaming establishment shall be erected within its borders upon dry land
They may, however, legally float upon any watercourse defining a state boundary
But while the gambling activity itself is restricted to riverboats, no such restriction applies to the functions ancillary to this cash besotted bidnis
The casino's offices, locker rooms, facilities to cook and clean, and most importantly its counting houses- the reinforced, secret, and super secure repositories of the lucre -- may all be situated
wherever
Gawain -- where is wherever
Say wha
Dorr's smug smile fades
Testily: Where is the money
Oh
End of every shift pit boss brings the cash down to the hold of the ship in the locked cash box; once a day all the cash boxes're moved to the counting room
And where is the counting room
Well, uh
in that square there
Where you pointing
And what, to flog a horse that if not at this point dead is in mortal danger of expirin', does the dotted square represent
Gawain hesitates, the question's obviousness suggesting to him some trick
Offices
Underground
Dorr's eyes close
smile of feline contentment curls his lips
He murmurs: Underground
Mmm
During the casino's hours of operation the door to the counting room is fiercely guarded, and the door itself is of redoubtable Pittsburgh steel; when the casino is closed the entire underground complex is locked up and the armed guard retreats to the casino's main entrance
There, then, far from the guard, reposes the money, cosseted behind a five-inch-thick steel portal, yes, but the walls, gentlemen, the walls of that room, are but humble masonry, behind which is only the soft loamy soil deposited over the centuries by Ol' Man, the meanderin' Mississip', as it fanned its way back and forth across this great alluvial plain
He has pried a fistfull of dirt from the cellar wall
This earth
He crumbles it, letting it sift to the floor, and then, pleased with himself, he smiles
Any questions
Lump looks around, then hesitantly raises his hand
Yes, Lump
What, uh
what does "cosseted" mean
Once again Dorr's smile fades
He does not dignify the question with answer
The General here, whose curriculum vitae compahends massive tunneling experience thoo the soil of his native French-Indochina, will direct our little ol' tunnelin' operation
The General acknowledges with a curt nod
Clark Pancake, while a master of none, is a jack of all those trades corollary to our aim
He will be doin' such fabricatin' and demolition work as our little caper shall require
Clark acknowledges verbally: Happy to be on board
Gawain is the proverbial "inside man"
He has managed to secure a berth on the custodial staff of the Lady Luck, thereby placin' himself in a position to perform certain chores whose precise nature needn't detain us here, but whose performance shall guide this expedition to its happy conclusion
Ya damn skippy
And this brings us to Lump
To look at Lump you might wonder, what function could he possibly fill, what specialized expertise could he possibly offer, to our merry little ol' band a miscreants
Well gentlemen, in a project of such magnitude and such risks, it is traditional -- nay, it is imperative -- to enlist the services of a hooligan, a goon, an ape, a physical brute, who will be our security, our fist, our batterin' ram
Lump is our blunt instrument, and on all our behalfs wish him a warm Mississippi welcome
Thanks, Professor
Well gentlemen, here you are, men of different backgrounds and differing talents, men with, in fact only two things in common: one, you all saw fit to answer my little advertisement in the Memphis Scimitar, and, two, you are all going to be, in consequence, very very incredibly rich
Let us revel in our adventure, gentlemen
Let us make beautiful music together
And above all, gentlemen, let us keep it to ourselves
What we say in this root cellar, let it stay in this root cellar
There's no "" in "team"
All stare at him
Lump has a very excellent point
The music swells, supported now by a male chorus that has the spirited manliness of the Red Army choir
We : -  - The men at work, tunneling
The cat sits on the cellar floor, head cocked, gazing at the hole now opened in the wall
Lump, in a sleeveless undershirt, glistening with sweat, wields a pickaxe at the forward point
At the mouth of the hole Clark Pancake shovels dirt into a heavy plastic refuse bag held open by Gawain
Dorr sits on a camp chair, one hand idly waving time to the music, reading an old and yellowed tome with half-glasses perched midway down his nose
The General hops nimbly out of the tunnel and unzips and steps out of his all-in-one to reveal, underneath, his neatly pressed leisure suit and ascot
-   - Later, Dorr stands at the head of the cellar stairs, looking around the empty parlor
He gives a nod down the stairs and the men troop up past him, carrying sacks of earth
Over the mantelpiece, the eternal flame of the devotional candle almost animating his features, Othar seems to watch the men as they cross to the front door
- The men load the earth into the hearse
- We are at the Mississippi bridge that we saw in the prologue to the movie, but now, in dead of night, deserted
The hearse is pulling up at the middle of the bridge and dimming its lights
The men emerge; when they open the back of the hearse to pull out the sacks, the cat bounds out to watch from a distance
We watch the men from ,   along the masonry of a tower that stands in the middle of the suspension bridge
An ornamental gargoyle leers in the foreground
The garbage scow is approaching
We hear the low toot of its horn as it nears the bridge
Lump is poised with the first sack hugged to his chest, leaning over the railing
The nose of the barge enters below us
Lump releases the sack
We watch it drop dead away like a bomb from an airplane
It thuds distantly onto the barge
The next sack has been passed up to Lump and is released
The cat watches
Its orange eyes blink
Its pupils adjust
-  - shows that the cat is in fact back in the basement
Its : continued tunneling
Back to the cat, watching, then turning its head at a noise: At the head of the stairs, the cellar door is opening
whistle from the General and Lump and Clark Pancake scramble from the tunnel
They whip a curtain over its opening and all men grab up their instruments as Dorr, covering with a cough, turns off the  player
The General, his ever-present cigarette smoldering between his lips, tongue-and-lips it up and backwards so that it is inside his mouth, which he now closes
Marva Munson is heavily and carefully descending the stairs
As the men come into view they are looking up at her, Lump holding his sackbutt but still glistening with sweat and smeared with dirt
That's okay, don't stop on account of me
Lump looks around, saucer-eyed, then blows gamely into his sackbutt
It sounds like goose farts until Dorr waves him down
No no, madam, we were about to take a break anyway
The glissandi on this particular piece are technically very demanding and  think we would all welcome a moment of relaxation
Huh
just thought you might like to see-what a you gotten up to, honey
Why you sweatin' like that
It is directed at Lump, who looks down at his own sweat- stained undershirt
, uh
That man plays one bitch barrelful a sackbutt
Ain't no one can blow the tenor sackbutt like Lump, hoowee
goes at that thing like it was a pu-- uh, like it was a woman
Goddamn
He-- She cuffs him on the head
You mind
don't want that kind of talk in my home, even in the root cellar
This is a Christian house, boy, none of that hippity-hop language
Sadly, Gawain is given to-- She slaps Gawain again
Sometimes it's the only way
He untenses after what seemed like the final blow, but -- -- she slaps him again
'm tryin' to help you, son
Better yaself
As well you should, ma'am
But Gawain at times is so far transported by his love of the music of the early Renaissance as to-- Don't make no never-mind he's transported
Dorr has her by the elbow and is ushering her back up the stairs
understand your-- She pulls her elbow away and sniffs
You been smokin'
Certainly not, madam
understand your indignation
And  was offering explanation, not excuse
myself am offended by those who cannot find the proper words to express themselves and have recourse to-- Gawain calls up the stairs: Don't you be explainin' me, dawg
You can't look into my mind, cape man
Yes, yes
Dorr's tone is soothing as he shuts the door at the top of the stairs
fiery lad
But then Youth is fiery
fact often remarked upon by the poets of the Romantic era
My youth  was in church,  wasn't walkin' around fiery
Youth ain't no excuse for nothin'
Well, anyway
only came down to show you the fife
She hands him a thick, roughly whittled piece of cane
Dorr holds it, looks at it dumbly
He is, for the first time that we have seen anyway, non-plussed
Othar's fife
He burned his own
Dorr tries to summon conversation as the two sit with their backs to the fireplace: Did he
Mm-hm
thought maybe bein' a musical man you'd be interested
Oh,  am indeed-- Cut it himself and burned the holes
Israelites called it a kalil
Ah
Kalil, fife, same thing
You can read about it in the Bible
Ain't nothin' new under the sun
Indeed not
Gone these twenty years
He was some kind of man
From Othar's , slightly high, we see them both twist in their chairs to look up at the portrait
of the portrait,
Othar looks down at us with what appears to be bemusement
Marva Munson and Dorr gaze up at the portrait for a motionless beat
At length, Marva Munson sighs: Blowed the kalil
Dorr's eyes remain on the picture as he inquires: don't suppose Othar ever turned his hand -- or, uh, heh-heh-heh, turned his lip -- to the shofar
Prompted by her silence, he adds: The ceremonial ram's horn, sounded by the priests of the Hebrews
don't know nothin' 'bout that
Othar didn't study no shofar, to the extent a my knowledge
The kalil was good enough for my Othar
She gazes at the portrait
Some kind of man
- following a woman in a red dress
(
) Hey baby, don't be cruel
Jus' sneak one little peek
The woman looks back over her shoulder, smiling, as she continues to walk
Don't let this uniform fool ya-- leads Gawain MacSam, pushing his wheeled trash bin
You don't need to be gamblin', honey, you lookin' at a sure thing
They call me Mr
21, baby, 'cause that's how  measure up
am the original black Jack, honey, accept no substitutions
You can pull my lever all day long, sweet mama,  ain't never gonna come up lemons
That's right, sugar, you can blow on my dice any ol' time
- '  - Gudge has his feet up on the desk and is filing his nails with an emery board
But Mr
Gudge, she had an ass that could pull a bus
This lady was fine, fine, dandy, divine
don't care how big her ass was, MacSam
You're fired
Say what
There is no fraternizing with customers on the Lady Luck
Clean out your locker
But Gudge- Get out of here
You're fired
You can't fire me
sue your ass
Sue me
For what
Sue you for fuckin' punitive damages, man
Punitive damages
Ya damn skippy
know you firin' my ass 'cause 'm black
Everyone on the custodial staff is black, MacSam
Your replacement's gonna be black
His replacement will no doubt be black
Fuckin' judge is gonna be black, motherfucker, that's who gonna be black
You gonna stand tall before the man
- We are looking down past the distinctive pylon-mounted yellow letters:
- The band of miscreants is seated around a table with cups of coffee
Dorr's wardrobe makes no concession to the informality of the setting; he still wears his cape and a black string tie
His manner is more mournful even than usual: Oh my
Oh my my my my my
This is a severe setback
am distraught am more than distraught,  am devastated
Oh my, this is quite the monkey-wrench heaved into the meticulously engineered construct of our little escapade
Yeah, it fucks things up
am beside myself
am at a positive loss for words
You still talkin' okay though
Have you all decided
Dorr's intensely mournful agitation is brought to bear upon her: Oh madam, we must have waffles
We must all have waffles forthwith
They hand in their menus
Oh we must think
We must all have waffles and think, each and every one of us to the very best of his ability
Perhaps if you apologized to the man and gave him flowers, or perhaps a fruit basket, with a card depicting a misty seascape and inscribed with a sentiment
Shit, man, it ain't about apologizin'
He fired me 'cause 'm black
He can't do that
You could sue him
Open and shut case
Fuckin'
This is not 1952
Man's a fuckin' bigot
Well then, perhaps, surely, a chocolate assortment has been known to warm the heart of even the most hardened misanthrope, especially if it's a premium chocolate, imported, say, from Switzerland, or the Netherlands, or some other of the so- called "Low" countries be they Dutch or Flemish or Walloon-- Walloon my ass, the man ain't gonna roll over for a fuckin' candy bar
'm afraid there's a setback on the tunneling front too
We've run into a pretty large rock, and-- -- Rock
All turn to look at the General
He continues to stare at a spot in space
He slowly releases some inhaled cigarette smoke, murmuring: Very bad
Oh my my, it seems that the poet was right: Troubles never singly come
Oh, we can get through the rock, no worries there
Simplest thing in the world
Why we blow right through it; 've got a pyro license, we bore a hole in the rock, pack in a little plastique; igneous blows pretty good, and we-- Is he gonna want a piece of the action
All turn to look at Lump
Who
Lump hesitates, looking at the inquiring faces that surround him
Igneous
female Voice: (
) Hello Clark
Am  ordering the prima cord
The men look up at her
Yes, Mountain, we were just talking about that, and some plastique
All the men are staring at her, agog
The fuck is this
This is Mountain Girl
Mountain is my right hand
She helps me with ordnance
Helps me with damn near everything
The men stare
You brought your bitch to the waffle house
There is tension in the air
Dorr clears his throat
confess myself to be puzzled as well
thought we all understood that, so far as our little enterprise is concerned, mum, as the saying would have it, is the word-- Of course
understand that
But this is Mountain
He chuckles
don't keep secrets from Mountain
That's not how you maintain a loving, caring relationship
You brought your bitch to the waffle house
He looks around
Man brings his bitch to the waffle house
Look, you, 'll thank you to stop referring to Mountain that way
She's the other half of my life
Everybody lookin' at me like 'm a fuck-up, losin' that sorry-ass job, and this motherfucker bring his bitch to the waffle house
Pancake lunges across the table, sending dishes clattering to the floor as he grabs Gawain by the shirt
You son of a bitch punk
Shut your goddamn mouth
He shakes him vigorously and rears back to take a swing at him
Gawain draws a gun
Come and get me motherfuck
Come on, baby, let's get it on
Mountain starts screaming
People look, aghast
Gentlemen, please
The other men pry Pancake and Gawain apart
Gentlemen, this sort of behavior does you no credit in the eyes of your colleagues, or in those of the other patrons of this waffle house
Pancake grumbles as he composes himself and straighten his clothes
Nobody talks to Mountain Girl that way
She had an abusive family
Fuck you, man
Little punk
got syrup on my safari jacket
He embraces Mountain, who continues to sob quietly
Gentlemen,  propose that we consider the matter of this woman, Mountain Water, to be-- Mountain Girl
am so very sorry
propose that we consider this matter to be closed, and we shall chose to trust her, since we now have no choice, and since she shall share only in Mr
Pancake's portion of the booty
Over the shoulder of the quietly weeping Mountain Girl: Of course
Wouldn't have it any other way
Damn right you won't
Up yours, punk
Gentlemen
And the manner of disposing of our igneous impediment is also settled
That leaves only the question of Gawain retrieving his job
Couldn't you just bribe the guy
All turn to look at Lump
- Othar looks serenely down from his spot over the mantelpiece
Marva Munson knits;
Dorr sits nodding over an ancient volume of half-forgotten lore, reading glasses perched midway down his nose
Curtains waft lazily in the summer night breeze
You just a readin' fool, ain't you Mr
Dorr
Yes yes,  must confess, madam, that often  feel more at home in these ancient volumes than  do in the hustle-bustle of our modern world
To me, paradoxically, the literature of the so-called "dead tongues" has more currency than this mornin's newspaper
Mm-mm
In these books
He removes his glasses and lazily twirls them
In these volumes, there is the accum'lated wisdom a mankind which succours me when the day is hard or the night lonely and long
Wisdom of mankind, what about the wisdom of the Lord
Oh yes, the Good Book, mm
have found reward in its pages
But for me there are other good books as well; the heavy volumes of Antiquity, freighted with the insights of Man's glorious age
And then of course love, love, love the works of Mr
Ed 'Allan Poe
know who he is
Kinda creepy
Oh no, madam, noooo
Not of this world, true; he lived in a dream, an ancient dream
Dorr himself is lost in a dream: "Helen, they beauty is to me Like those Nicean barks a yore That gently, o'er a perfumed sea, The weary, wayworn wanderer bore To his own native shore
" Who was Helen
She wasn't a loose woman, was she
Some kinda whore a Babylon
Dorr is still lost: One doesn't know who Helen was, though picture her as bein' very, very extremely
pale
He comes to himself, focuses on Mrs
Munson
Miz Munson,  was tryin' to think of some way of expressin' my gratitude to you for takin' in
He chuckles
this weary, wayworn wanderer
The Professor takes a small ticket envelope from where it had served as bookmark, and hands it across
It's just a modest little ol' present, why it's practically nothing at all
Beaming, she takes two tickets out of the envelope and inspects them
Oh Mr
Dorr, why you are such a gallant man
Oh no madam,  blush
melt
No, just happened to hear of this gospel concert tomorrow night, The Mighty Mighty Clouds of Joy, and  thought you and a friend from church, perhaps
Othar loved that music
Yes,  got a widow-lady friend
The concert is up in Memphis, but have arranged for a car service to transport you thither and, needless to say, back home at the concert's termination
My friends and  will be rehearsing here tomorrow evening so you needn't worry about the security of your charming little old house
There is a knock at the door
Huh
Excuse me
/
-  - Mrs
Munson swings the door open to Sheriff Wyner
His squad car is parked at the curb
Sheriff Wyner, how you doin'
-   - The Professor's eyes widen with concern as he hears the voices, off: (
) Evenin', Miz Munson,  just came by
/
-  - The sheriff is tipping his hat and already backing away, trying to make his visit brief: to let you know  had a word with WeeMack
He says he gonna comply with your request, keep the music down and neighborly
Mm-hm
He calls from the bottom of the stoop: So you have a pleasant evening now, and just let us know-- Hang on there, Sheriff, somebody want you to meet
Ma'am, 'm a little pressed for time-- Why, you chasin' a gang of bank robbers
Get on in here say hello
-   - The Voices approach: We was just havin' tea, talkin' about Othar-- The two enter and Mrs
Munson stops short, looking
The living room is empty
Even the Professor's teacup is gone
Hm
Bussed his own dishes
You can always tell a gentleman
The sheriff, hat in hand, gazes about
Someone was here, ma'am
Mm-hm, with me'n Othar
Once again, he tries to excuse himself: Well, maybe 'll catch him next time
Come on up to his room
- '  - The door opens and the two look in
The neatly made bed next to the small, barren dresser
Mm, he's neat
Very neat
Probably went down to the cellar to play with his friends
She turns
Ma'am,  really have to
Top-teased by a dust ruffle in the foreground, we see Mrs
Munson's heavy orthopedic shoes turning to pass Sheriff Wyner's shiny black boots
shows Dorr, cheek pressed to the floor, his teacup and saucer under the bed with him
be gettin' back
Mrs
Munson is about to go out the door but notices something: corner of the Professor's cape, protruding from under the end of the bed
What the
fearfully watching
The heavy orthopedic shoes approach, and then, with loud Mr
Mogul sounds of effort, Mrs
Munson's hands and knees hit the floor
Her head drops in to view to peer in, her own cheek against the floorboards
What the
Why, Professor
We see the Sheriff watching and his   of Mrs
Munson's enormous ass
What you doin' havin' tea down there
Dorr makes silent hand waves to disavow his own presence
Mrs
Munson roars with laughter
With difficulty she pushes herself back upright, still laughing
Land of Goshen
Get out from under there
Miz Munson, my pager just went off
Why of all the
- / - The Sheriff is already backing down the stairs: 'Fraid  gotta respond
He opens the front door and calls up: 'll try to meet your friend some other time
- '  - Dorr shimmies out from under the bed
Well that was very
refreshing
As you know
He gets to his feet, slaps dust from the front of his pants
we academics are inordinately fond of wedgin' ourselves into confined spaces
At Yale the students will see how many of their number they can enclose in a telephone booth; Harvard, a broom closet
Why  never
There was the goldfish-swallowin' craze, of course, a different but related phenomenon
Ahem
hope didn't spill any tea
- '  - The box is being pulled open
(
) What the hell is this
shows Gawain in Mr
Gudge's office as Gudge, behind the desk, looks at the gift-wrapped box
It's just my way of sayin', well, goddamnit,  don't know what it's like walkin' in your shoes, bein' all tightass and all, and you don't know what it's like to walk in my shoes, but, well
Gudge is opening a card that was inside the box
Its floral front says in gold script, "'m Sorry
If  hurt your feelings
" You know, there's the custodian, and then there's the man inside the custodian, y'understand what 'm sayin'
Gudge opens the card
Inside is a hundred-dollar bill
and that man has needs, dig, and guess those needs, Mr
Gudge, which they usually involve women with big asses, well those motherfuckin' needs sometimes well up over the custodian like the motherfuckin' Johnstown Flood
But my point is it ain't gonna happen again
Not if it's humanly possible
Gudge reads the card, flips it over to look at its back
Hmm
But Jesus, if you'd seen the ass on that girl, Mr
Gudge, you'd a wanted her sitting on your face too
Well, we're all human
Ya damn skippy
This apology buys you a one-week probationary period
Stay away from the customers, MacSam
- Pancake is on his stomach, wearing goggles, boring a hole into a rock face with a power drill
-  - We hear the whine of the drill faintly here, all but covered by the sound of the chamber music on the boom box
The other men sit around
Dorr gives a casual glance at his watch as the whine subsides
Pancake emerges from the tunnel covered with grime
The drill bit's getting awfully hot
Gawain, maybe you could fill a hudson sprayer and spritz it down while drill
Fuck you, man,  ain't your house nigger
'm the inside man
Look, are you gonna have a bug up your ass for the rest of the time we work together
'll get the sprayer
No no, me and this gentleman here have to get square
Let me tell you something, MacSam
You wanna know something
don't wanna know shit from you
Pancake leans against the wall and pushes his goggles up on his forehead, leaving raccoon eyes
'm gonna tell you how  came down to Mississippi
Wasn't born here, you know
'm from Scranton, Pennsylvania
Abruptly, he stares off into space
Nnnff
Huh
Pancake's eyes regain their focus: Scranton, Pennsylvania
Came down here in 1964
Greyhound Bus
With the Freedom Riders
You know who the Freedom Riders were, MacSam
don't give a shit who they were
Just tell me when they gonna leave
The Freedom Riders, my fine young man, were a group of concerned liberals from up North -- whites, Negros, and yes, Jewish people -- all working together, just like we are here
Concerned citizens who came down here so that local black people could have their civil liberties
So that people like you could have the vote
All look at Pancake
Quiet, except for the delicate chamber music
Gawain's tone softens: You know what, man
What, brother
don't vote
So fuck you
Pancake darkens: Why you fucking-- And the bus you rode in on
That's it
He peels off his coat
Let's step outside, MacSam
There is a knock on the cellar door
The men freeze momentarily, then scramble for their instruments
The General flips his cigarette backwards into his mouth
Dorr turns off the boom box, then calls: Yes, madam
The door opens and Mrs
Munson comes down the stairs, holding a large plate covered by a checked napkin
My friend Mrs
Funthes is here so 'm about to go on out
just wanted to leave y'all with some cinnamon cookies
She takes the napkin off and carries the plate from person to person; each obediently takes a cookie with a murmured "Thank you, ma'am
" 'all sound pretty good
It'd be nice if you'd come by the church some day, give us a recital
Dorr takes her by the arm and escorts her back to the stairs
Oh madam, you are too kind
Our music, however, is -- how shall  put it
-- rather Roman in its outlook; many of our pieces were commissioned by the Holy See
Oh,  see all right, but we don't make a big whoop-dee-do about denominations; everybody welcome at our church
We've had Methodists come in
Episcopals
Even had a Jew come in once with a guitar back in the sixties
Indeed
Excuse me, one moment, ma'am, and  shall see you off
They have reached the top of the stairs and the Professor ushers her out but stays behind himself
He turns to address the rest of the men below: If you gentlemen can labor harmoniously in the course of my absence, then perhaps upon my return we shall be prepared to explode that vexin' ol' piece a igneous
He's the motherfuckin' piece of igneous
-   - The Professor emerges from the cellar
Mrs
Munson awaits with her friend who is likewise togged out in fancy Sunday dress and carrying a shiny black purse
Professor, this is Rosalie Funthes, Rosalie, Professor
Dorr, Ph
Oh my, that's an awful lot of letters
Well of course in my youth  was simply known as Goldthwait
-  - Pancake is taking the boom box off the table to clear some space
All right, safety meeting, let's listen up
General, could you hand me the prima cord and the compound there
Before we set the charge we'll run through our procedure
Various paraphernalia are laid out on the table
The cat sits in a corner of the cellar, watching carefully and, it seems, listening attentively
have earplugs for whoever wants them
Just wedge them in your ears
Now here we have -- not yet, Lump
Lump stops putting in his earplugs
Now
Prima cord
Gelatinite
C4
Time comes, we pack the hole in the rock with the C4 and insert two leads
He holds up one lead
and
He holds up the other lead
Charge comes from a battery that is inside this plunger
Ordinary auto battery, you can pick it up at Sears, easiest thing in the world
- black town car idles at the curb
Dorr is just escorting the two ladies out the front door and down the stoop
remember my father telling me -- and it is one of the few memories retain of the man, from one of his visits home, and how  do cherish it -- he said, "Goldthwait, you are not formed as other little boys
" Mm-mm
He a man of learnin'
number two was self-educated; he had no career, as such, though the state recognized the breadth of his readin' by making him librarian at the state nervous hospital in Meridian, where he was a distinguished inmate
-  - Pancake sets down the two electrical leads and picks up a hammer
This is the same procedure we will be using when we collapse the tunnel after entering the casino vault and returning to the root cellar
He looks pointedly at Gawain
This is for your own protection, so pay close attention
Once these materials are combined only the professionals may handle them
That means me, or the General
Separately they are harmless-completely inert
Why, you could light this stuff on fire, hit it with a hammer-- He swings the hammer down onto the plastique-- - --and there is the dull thud of an explosion and the house's windows rattle in their frames
The Professor, at the open door of the car into which the two ladies have just sat, looks up at the house, as do the ladies
What in the name of heaven was that
Dorr stares at the house, appalled
'm
quite sure
that there is
no cause for alarm
He struggles for self-possession
Why, 'm not even absolutely certain that  heard anything at all
Didn't hear anything
Well, something, perhaps, but
Marva Munson starts to get out of the car
nothing that need discompose us, was the sense  was trying to convey
He urges her back into her seat
Miz Munson,  will not have you missing your musical recital
Why, you go ahead now
Miz Funthes, you as well,  beg of you
He is backing up the walk
shall call the gas company, or the water company, or whatever subterranean utility is implicated in this little
occurrence shall see to the matter
as only a highly educated classicist could
At the door now, he gives the two women peering out the car window a smiling but vigorous wave away, which they do not heed, and then he enters
-   - The room is filled with smoke
Othar, slightly askew over the mantel, looks a little huffy
We hear clomping and screaming on the cellar stairs
Lump bursts out, shrieking: Blood, Professor
Oh my God
Blood
The General comes bounding up the stairs like a panther, a cigarette burning in his lips
He lands catlike in the living room, glides to the blubbering Lump, grabs one shoulder firmly with one hand, and with the other slaps him sharply, once forehand, once backhand
Lump stares at him, shocked, his blubbering cut short
More noise is coming from the stairs: why, it's nothing to make a fuss about
Perfectly all right
happens all the time
You gotta go find it, dipshit
Pancake emerges from the stairwell, his hair singed, his face and the front of his jumpsuit darkened by the blast
He is clutching one hand with the other
No, no
Really, 'm perfectly all right
Gawain has ascended just behind to hector him over his shoulder: Perfectly all right
You just blew your fucking finger off
Sure, but-- Well get back down there and find it, man
ain't pickin' up your goddamn finger
gather there was a premature detonation-- They can sew that shit back on, jack
Like that guy his wife cut his dick off
Just sewed that motherfucker back on
Of course
Simplest thing in the world
Microsurgery-- Saw that motherfucker in a porno
Thing still works
Pancake is pale from loss of blood and his pontifications lack full conviction: Oh yes, they have remarkable abilities in the, uh
- Quiet
The two women sit in the idling car, looking at the house
From the house there is very muted bellowing
Still looking toward the house, Mrs
Munson offers a word of explanation to her friend: They using the house to practice music a the rococo
Mmmm-hm
-   - The cat, with a human finger in its mouth, sidles cautiously to one side, warily eying someone
(
) Get him
The General, pluming cigarette in his mouth, tensed arms extended outwards, sidles cautiously to cut him off
propose that we get our fallen comrade to the hospital, and the General shall follow when he manages to recover the severed digit
don't know what all the fuss is about
The cat jumps
The General leaps to follow
- The two women looking
The front door of the house opens
Lump, the Professor, and Gawain emerge, escorting Pancake
Just before Gawain finishes closing the door the cat slips out
The door is yanked fully open and the General races out after the cat
You catch Pickles now
The cat races across the lawn and, with no break in stride, up his favorite tree
The General follows and, also without breaking stride, clambers up the tree after it
Tree limbs shake with activity hidden by the leaves
We hear the hiss of the cat
The men are bundling Pancake into the hearse
Dorr calls to the women before climbing in: The house is perfectly in order, but we need medical attention for Mr
Pancake who, during the disturbance, pinched his finger in a valve of the sackbutt
The cat leaps out of the tree and runs away down the road
You let the cat out
The General leaps out of the tree to land catlike on the street, arms tensed, casts a look both ways, and then pursues the animal down the road
We hear the retreating padding footsteps of all six feet
The General is even now exercising every effort to retrieve your mischievous little pet
Please go, go and enjoy your concert, and we shall see you later in the evening
Au revoir, mes dames
- new day
The garbage scow chugs down the mighty Mississippi
It toots its horn
-  - It shows the underground complex and, stretching towards it in a line drawn with a blunt pencil, is the tunnel
It is now almost to the vault
violin bow enters to tap at the line
(
) Despite our little setback we find ourselves on schedule to penetrate the vault
The bow taps at the vault outline
here, this afternoon, having successfully blasted that little ol' rock to pieces during Miz Munson's choir practice
The violin bow withdraws
Clark, perhaps you can run us through the game plan for what remains of our tunnelin'
bandaged hand enters frame and a finger-stump points at the end of the penciled line
(
) Of course
Why, it's child's play now, easiest thing in the world
Only a couple of feet separate us from the vault
The men are clustered around the map, spread out on the sackbutt case in the cellar
Clark continues: Just the usual spadework until we hit the masonry of the vault, and then we drill through
And will you be able to wield the drill with your maimed extremity
Oh,  should think so, it's only one finger
Inhibits me in doing finer work, of course
'll always have to live with that
Ahem
Maybe, and 'm just thinking out loud here, maybe since, as you say, it will present problems later
Yes, Clark
Well, maybe -- and this is something 've talked over with Mountain Girl, and she agrees with me, so it's not just one person's opinion -- maybe should get a little extra compensation for the accident
long, stony silence
Somewhat larger share
Why, if this were any other line of work 'd be getting workmen's comp, wouldn't Might even have a pretty good lawsuit
You gonna sue yaself for blowin' off your finger
Well that is simply asinine-- Yes but you see, Clark, this is not what you just called "some other line of work
" But if it were-- This is a criminal enterprise, not to put too fine a point on it, entailin' all manner a risks not involved in honest labor
Governmental regulations an' civic safeguards cannot be assumed to apply to antisocial pursuits
Yeah, but he lost his finger
We don't give a shit
Man can blow his own dick off, don't make no nevermind to us
We don't gotta pay the man for goin' around blowin' off body parts
Getcha head outcha ass, man
Look, you-- think that in this instance Gawain has a very excellent point
-- No extra share
All stop and stare at the General
Clark grumbles: Well, okay, majority rules, like say, it was just a trial balloon
Hand's not so bad really,  even get some phantom feeling
You pull on your prick you get phantom feeling
Greedy motherfuck
Now that that matter is settled, let us synchronize our watches before Gawain reports to work
In
twenty seconds
it will be twelve-sixteen exactly
fifteen
It will be twelve-fifteen
No, in fifteen seconds -- now eleven seconds -- it will be twelve- sixteen
eight
Professor
Six
five -- yes, Lump
don't have a watch
- It is the weathered doorway to the main entrance of the Lady Luck
hand enters to rap
(
) Yeah
Me, dickwad
low, chesty chuckle
The door swings open and Gawain enters
- garbage bin is being wheeled across the empty casino floor
Gawain is wheeling it
He is approaching the tunnel to the corporate annex
As they roll down the tunnel
- Loud singing at the cut
We are looking at Mrs
Munson in the middle of the choir, holding forth in song
-   - Gawain leans back against the wall next to the vault door, arms folded across his chest
Faintly, from inside the vault, we hear the whine of a power tool
Gawain leans over and punches the button on boom box that hangs from the rolling garbage bin
The hallway pulses with " Left My Wallet In El Segundo
" - More singing, Mrs
Munson and the rest of the choir now clapping as they sing
-  - The power-tool whine is louder here
We are looking at a patch of wall
After a beat, and with a loud rev as resistance gives way, a drill bit emerges from the wall, spitting out bits of the masonry
The drill withdraws
After a beat, hammer blows
The chunk of masonry begins to buckle
-   - The General opens the door, still somehow immaculately groomed
Gawain enters
- The gospel number rising to climax, supported by the organist and the rest of the congregation
-  - Clark and Lump, covered in dirt and plaster dust, have started stuffing bundled bills and small sacks into large garbage bags
An irregular hole, about three feet across, gapes in the far wall
Gawain punches off the boombox, looking at all the money
Well ain't that somethin'
Clark suddenly freezes in the act of collecting money
He straightens slowly
Hnnnn
Arrunggggh
Rnffff
He stands stock still, wincing, gazing off into space
Mmmmnggh
He whispers hoarsely, urgently: The other men look at him
Say what
Irritable Bowel Syndrome
Is there a men's room down here
Oh man, you shouldn't be using the men's room-- Or a lady's room
Quickly
You shoulda shit back in the house, man
We don't want Elron finding you in the goddamn crapper
Clark's voice is still hoarse
He does small knee bends of urgency: No choice
Quickly
It's a medical condition
You are disgusting, man
All right, follow me
- We are   Gawain peering anxiously to one side
He turns and peers the other way
We hear a toilet flush and, after a beat, Clark emerges from the men's room door next to which Gawain stands
His manner is now completely relaxed
Feel thirty pounds lighter
They start walking back to the vault
Thank you for being so understanding
Not everyone is, of course, which is why the biggest challenge of  is educating the public
Afflicts over two million people yet most of us have never heard of it
And it strikes without regard to age, gender or race
Oh fuck, man,  don't wanna know about it
That's the kind of attitude we're fighting
Well maybe you should sign me up, man, 'cause you startin' to irritate my bowel
- The choir finishes a number and sits -- all except for Marva Munson, who unties the knot on her robe at the nape of her neck, slips it off and, with murmured goodbyes, slips away
-  - As the two men enter Clark is still holding forth: guess  never told you, that's how Mountain Girl and  met
They had an  Weekend at Grossinger's, in the Catskills
Of course the tourist business up there has suffered, with the demise of the Borscht Belt
So they have different promotions, mixers, so on
This was a weekend for Irritable Bowel singles to meet and support each other and share stories
Man,  don't wanna hear a single one a them stories
Well, some of them are very-- Not one fuckin' story
You one fucked- up motherfucker
You-- They stop short, looking: The General and Lump are standing in the middle of the floor, stock still, each clutching a bag of money, staring up at the same corner of the ceiling
Lump turns to Clark and Gawain
Hey, lookit that
Gawain and Clark join them in the middle of the vault and look up at the corner of the ceiling
small video camera, aimed squarely at the four men
Black-and-white video, very    , of the four motionless men below goggling up at the lens
Smoke plumes from the General's cigarette
Huh
Looks like an Ikegami
He slips on his reading glasses as he gets a leg up on a shelf just below the camera and hoists himself
He peers in at the lens
Clark looming into
Oh yeah
Mm-hm
'm not sure whether it's broadcasting
Um-hm
No
He is fingering the back of the camera
Hard wire
Down below, Gawain looks at the wire snaking along the seam of wall and ceiling
At the opposite corner it travels down the joint of the two walls
He traces its path down and then across one wall at chair- rail height towards the door
The other men follow in an anxious herd as he traces one finger along it
Just before reaching the vault door the wire goes through the wall in a hole finished off with a grommet
Gawain goes out the vault door
-   - and picks up the line where it emerges on the other side, travels down to the joint of wall and floor, and then continues along the floor
Gawain follows it and the other men continue to follow him
He traces it anxiously down the hall in a hunched lope
The other men scuttle behind into
-   - The wire winds around into the room, back up to chair-rail height, along one wall, behind some cabinetry which Gawain hurries past to find it again on the far side, and then down to a video recorder
It is not, however, hooked up to the video recorder: its pronged end swings loose just by where it would be plugged in
Inside the video recorder is a casette, which Gawain ejects
The men crowd to look over his shoulder as he examines it: "Shevann's Schvanz"
There is a pile of other videos by the monitor: "Charlayne and the Chocolate Factory," "Big Dick Blaque's Big Night Out," "Lemme Tell Ya 'Bout Black Chicks," "Anus & Andy
" Just next to the pile is an old bowl of Kocoa Krispies
-  - The General climbs into the tunnel with a garbage bagful of money, followed by Lump, likewise encumbered
Lump hands back out a satchel to Gawain, who sets it on the vault floor by the hole
From the way he handles it, it is quite heavy
Pancake, also with a bag of money, is getting ready to climb in: Look,  didn't choose to have -- Shut the fuck up
Lump hands Gawain a smaller, lighter satchel which he likewise sets on the floor
There's no cure, you know
Only control
Lifelong condition
Not complaining, just fact
And  did meet Mountain
Grab your bag and get in that fucking hole
- Mrs
Munson is leaving, with singing still audible from the service that continues inside
-  - We are looking from inside the tunnel towards its mouth, where the Professor stoops slightly to peer in, anxiously dry-washing his hands
shows the hunched-over men scuttling along the tunnel towards us, holding large garbage sacks
Welcome back, gentlemen, mission accomplished  see
am so very very delighted
He gives a hand down to each man as he exits the tunnel
Congratulations
Congratulations
have some cold duck on ice for the occasion
Maybe we could have something to drink, too
-  - Gawain, left behind, is muttering to himself as he uses a trowel and other instruments from his satchel to patch up the hole at his end of the tunnel
Motherfucker can't stop talking, can't stop shitting
Motherfucker tell everyone about his motherfuckin' asshole
No one gives a shit about his asshole
Nobody interested in another man's asshole
Or his bitch's
- Mrs
Munson is letting herself in
-  - The men are sitting around the table, champagne glasses raised
On the table sits the money, stacked in orderly piles
Gentlemen, to we few
We who have shared each other's company, each other's care, each other's joy, and who now reap the fruits of our communal effits, shoulder to shoulder, from each accordin' to his abilities so forth whatnot
We have had our little diffences along the way, it's true, but  like to think they have only made us value one another the more, each coming to understand and appreciate the other's unique qualities, potencies, and, yes, foibles
suggest that we shall look back upon this caper one day, one distant day, grandchildren dandled upon our knee, and perhaps a tear will form, and we shall say, Well, with wit, and grit, and no small amount of courage, we accomplished something on that day, a feat of derring-do, an enterprise not ignoble -- we, merry band, unbound by the constraints of society and the prejudices of the common ruck, we happy few
Gentlemen -- to us
To us
They clink
-  - Upstairs Mrs
Munson runs water into a teapot, humming to herself
-  - Having finished patching, Gawain starts painting
He turns on his boombox, and out comes the big bassy " Left My Wallet in El Segundo
" -  - The men, having drunk deep, are setting down their glasses
Pancake looks at his watch with some concern
Charge should've gone off already
do beg your pardon
The charge to collapse the tunnel set it for eight minutes
Dorr looks at his watch
Well that time, and more, has most certainly elapsed
Looking toward the mouth
The men stoop over and peek fearfully in
They again stand upright
silence
Dorr clears his throat
need not remind you of the importance of obliterating any trace of a connection between the vault and this house
It was of the essence of this plan that it should appear that the money had simply vanished
Without a trace
Spirited away, as it were, by ghosts
Of course
understand
The conundrum of the undisturbed yet empty vault, the unsolvable riddle of the sealed yet violated sanctum, is of the utmost importance not only to make our caper innelectually satisfying
It is also exigent as a matter of practical fact:  remind you that if a tunnel is ever found leading to this house, this house's owner knows all of your names
She certainly does
Therefore -- to draw the unavoidable conclusion -- someone shall have to reenter the tunnel to reset that charge
- Pancake, hunched over, scurries along the tunnel
He reaches the remnants of a large rock, where the tunnel grows smaller
He drops to crawl position and elbows his way forward, toolbelt clanking along
We are getting closer and closer to a muffled but thuddingly bassy " Left My Wallet in El Segundo
" -  - The music loudly present at the cut
Gawain takes a handheld blowdryer out of his satchel and flips it on, directing it at the fresh paint on the wall whose repairs are now invisible
- Music once again muffled
Pancake has reached a little - displaying timer with leads trailing off of it
He grabs it, puts on his reading glasses, squints
The display shows:  : 00:12
The colons in the display rhythmically blink, but the number does not advance
For some reason, stuck
Huh
He reaches to his tool belt, pulls out his Leatherman
-   - Mrs
Munson is setting places at a large table
There are about a dozen place settings
- Pancake now has a mini-mag light clenched between his teeth, aimed down at the timer
He opens the phillips head on his Leatherman but abruptly stops and stares off into space
Nnnnrungh
He is squinting with pain
The muffled hip-hop song is beginning to recede
- Gawain is wheeling his garbage cart out the door
The vault is completely empty but looks completely undisturbed
He closes the heavy vault door behind him, leaving quiet
- Quiet here as well, now
Pancake's moan trails off to nothing
He relaxes
The moment, whatever it was, has passed
He looks back down at the unit, flicks it with his finger, and it emits a soft beep
Huh
He squints at the back of the unit
As it beeps again, he turns the unit over to look at its face
The readout now says: 00:10
As he watches, peering down through the bottom of his glasses, it continues to advance with a beep as each second slips by: 9
8
What the-- His eyes widen and he frantically shakes the unit
It continues beeping
He briefly and sloppily tries to fit the phillips head into one of the four screws on the back of the unit but immediately gives up and starts a panicked wriggle back up the tunnel, whimpering
- Gawain is wheeling his garbage cart past Elron
-   - Mrs
Munson is placing the last piece of silverware, just so
- Pancake is in full panicked awkward flight as-- -  - --
We   the cellar and Pancake is shot out the tunnel like a human cannonball, trailing a comet-tail of dirt, dust, and debris that wafts what were neatly stacked bills up into the air
-   - The portrait of Othar jostles back to square
He now looks a little angry
The cat arches her back, emitting a startled yowl
Mrs
Munson stands, frozen, then looks slowly around, trying to assimilate what has just happened
- Gawain and Elron are staring at each other, frozen, also reacting to what just happened
Finally: You just fart
Heh-heh-heh
-   - Mrs
Munson is looking at the cellar door
Dust drifts out from under it
She takes a slow step towards it
Another step
She opens the door
There is no visibility in the cellar due to swirling clay dust
She takes one step down the stairs, waving at the air in front of her face
Paper money wafts in and out of the dust
We hear Voices: (
) Perfectly all right
Not a problem
(
) Well there sure as shit ain't no tunnel left
The clearing dust reveals the caped Professor anxiously dancing from foot to foot, gathering money out of the air
As he reaches up to grab a bill that has him facing up in Mrs
Munson's direction, he freezes
His  reveals her through dissipating dust
Professor, 'm surprised
There is a long beat, through which all stare at her
Properly speaking, madam, we have been surprised; you are taken aback
Though  acknowledge that the sense you intend is gaining currency through increasing use
Further dissipation of the dust reveals how much money there is, settling now to cover the floor of the cellar
You have returned from your devotions betimes
We hear the ring of the doorbell
hadda fix tea
wanna talk to you, Professor, don't you be leavin'
And don't make any more noise
And you
She points at the General who, in the excitement, has neglected to hide his ever-present cigarette
told you,  don't want any smokin' in here
She clomps upstairs and shuts the cellar door
- We   towards the front door, angry and lost in thought
Her look softens somewhat as she opens the door
It is a chattering infestation of hens: all of her friends from church push in wearing church dresses and elaborate hats
-  - The men are still frozen looking up toward the door
The muted cackle of church ladies
The men gradually unfreeze
She saw everything
She saw our hole
He turns to Dorr, near tears: She saw our hole, Professor
Dorr rubs his hands anxiously, thinking: Yes
Yes
What do we do
Well, first, my dear boy, we follow the General's example
The General remains staring up at the door, frozen but for the smoke pluming from the cigarette in his mouth
and refrain from panic
Secondly, we cooly, calmly, collectedly think
think
The gaze of all the men drifts back up to the cellar door, and we look down at them, gazing up
-   - The chattering ladies are gathered at the table, Mrs
Munson pouring them tea
The cellar door creaks noisily -- one might almost say gothically -- ajar, and the Professor peers out with an ingratiating smile
Hsst
Madam
The chattering abates and the ladies all look at him
His smile broadens into ghastliness and he crooks a finger toward Mrs
Munson
Mrs
Munson, if  might have a word
You get back down those stairs
assure you  shall be-- Hush
Down those stairs
We havin' tea now
be down shortly
He nods meekly and retreats, easing the door creakily shut
The ladies look inquisitively at Mrs
Munson as his footsteps are heard descending the stair
He's the tenant
Mm-hm
- As the Professor rejoins the still staring and silent group
The money has been picked up and is once again in stacks upon the table
She shall be down shortly
Explaining, he indicates upstairs with a jerk of the head: Tea
Dainties
The men nod, murmuring
The cellar door squeaks open
There is the clomp of careful footsteps on the stair
Using only tongue and teeth, the General flips his smoking cigarette inwards into his mouth and gives Mrs
Munson his usual deadpan look
She halts halfway down the stairs, still wearing an apron and holding a spatula
don't know what you boys been up to but  wasn't born yesterday and know mischief when  see it
Now want an explanation, but first want you boys to get your fannies up here with y'alls period instruments
been tellin' the ladies about your music and they wanna hear you play
She turns to head back up the stairs but abruptly stops to turn and give the General a hard look which he innocently returns
Hmph
She turns again and clomps back up the stairs
The General opens his mouth and, again without using his hands, restores his cigarette to its usual place on his lower lip
Lump is fretful: Professor
Yes, Lump
can't really play the buttsack
-   - The cellar door opens and the men troop out,
Dorr leading and the other men following rather sheepishly behind
Madame -- or rather, mesdames -- you will have to accept our apologies for failing to perform since, as you see, we are shorthanded
Gawain is still at work and we could no more play with one part tacit than a horse could canter shy one leg
Mm-hmm
Hmph
Perhaps  could offer as a poor but ready substitute a brief poetic recital
Though  don't pretend to great oratorical skills,  will happily present, with your ladies' permission, verse from the unquiet mind of Mr
Ed 'Allan Poe
Lump, Pancake, and the General sit and awkwardly accept dainty teacups
The Professor rises, spreads his hand, and pronounces: "Ladies, thy beauty is to me Like those Nicean barks of yore
" - of the various ladies, some sipping tea or slowly munching biscuits, but all eyes glued to the declaiming man in the cape
"That gently, o'er a perfumed sea The weary, wayworn wanderer bore To his own native shore
" Murmuring Voice: Amen
slurp of tea from another quarter
Dorr bears on: "On desperate seas long wont to roam, Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face, Thy Naiad airs have brought me home To the glory that was Greece And the grandeur that was Rome
" long silence
Then, scattered: Mm-mm
Glory hallelujah
lady holding a teacup turns to the General: That was soooome poem
The General stares at her
You know any
We hear the front door opening and Gawain enters, still wearing his Lady Luck custodial uniform
He looks
His : church ladies with teacups and his comrades seated among them, also holding teacups and scones
'all been celebratin'
-  -  () The bustling and chattering ladies are just finishing leaving; Mrs
Munson is seeing them off at the door
Evening is gathering, and we hear the lonely toot of the distant garbage scow
The men as well stand by the door and, affecting good cheer, wave off the departing ladies
Goodbye, ladies
We had such a pleasant time
Mrs
Munson closes the door and her manner instantly darkens
Now,  wanna know what's goin' on
Yes indeed, and the thirst for knowledge is a very commendable thing
Though in this instance,  believe when you hear the explanation, you will laugh riotously, slappin' your knee and perhaps even wipin' away a giddy tear, relieved of your former concern
Hmph
You see Lump here is an enthusiastic collector of Indian arrowheads and, having found one simply lying on your cellar floor, a particularly rare artifact of the Natchez tribe, he enlisted us in an all-out effort to sift through the subsoil in search of others
Well, in doing so, we apparently hit a motherlode of natural gas --  myself became acutely aware of the smell of "rotten eggs" -- and it was at just this unfortunate moment that the General here violated one of the cardinal rules of this house and lit himself a cigarette
The General stiffly bows: So sorry
The Professor, nodding, smiling, and dry-washing his hands, continues to look at Mrs
Munson, though his story, apparently, has ended
She returns his ingratiating look with a stare
What about all that money
Dorr's smile fades
Ah
The money
The money is
Mr
Pancake's
That's right
He only just re-mortgaged his house in order to pay for the procedure that will correct the wandering eye of his common-law wife, Mountain Water, who suffers from astygmia and strabismus and a general curdling of the vitreous jelly
Mr
Pancake however is an ardent foe of the federal reserve and is in fact one of those eccentrics about whom one occasionally reads, hoarding his entire life savings either under the proverbial mattress or, as in Mr
Pancake's case, in a Hefty bag that is his constant companion
Under her stare, he elaborates: Steel Sack
Don't trust the banks
Never have
She thinks, decides
This don't smell right
'm callin' Sheriff Wyner
chorus of gasps
Madam -- if you please
Yes
Yes
It was a lie
fantastic tale
You have us
Dead to rights
But please allow me to tell you the truth -- in private
-   - He escorts her to sit beneath the portrait of Othar, sits across from her, and leans confidentially in
Madam
He agonizes
The words do not come easy
What  am about to reveal to you, you may find
shocking
Mrs
Munson, must tell you that we are not
what we appear
Mm-hm
We are not in fact musicians of the late Renaissance
Nor of the early or mid period
We are, in fact
criminals
Desperate men, madam
We have tunneled into the nearby offices of the Lady Luck gambling emporium and have relieved it of its treasure
Lord have mercy
It is true that the Lady Luck is a den of iniquity, a painted harlot luring people into sin and exciting the vice of greed with her false promise of easy winnings
Oh, her gains are ill-gotten, yes, but offer no excuses -- save one
We men have each pledged half of our share of the booty to a charitable institution -- the General, to a placement service for Southeast Asian refugees; Mr
Pancake to the Blue Ridge Parkway Conservancy; and Lump to the United Jewish Appeal
As compensation for use of your house we had planned to donate a full share to Bob Jones University, without burdening you with guilty knowledge by informing you of same
But you have wrested the information from me
Now it is all on the table
Now you have it, the whole story, the awful truth
Stolen money
Yes, yes, shamefully  admit it, yes
But find the victim, Mrs
Munson, challenge you
Even the casino itself, that riparian Gomorra, shall suffer no harm
It has an insurance company, a financial behemoth that will cheerfully replenish its depleted vaults
That is its function
And the insurance company itself is made up of tens and tens of thousands of policy-holders so that -- we have done the calculations, Mrs
Munson
-- so that at the end of the day, at the final reckoning, each policy- holder shall have contributed only one penny -- one single solitary cent -- to the satisfaction of this claim
Just one penny
Think of it, Mrs
Munson
One cent from thousands upon thousands of people so that Bob Jones University can continue on its mission
Why, have no doubt that, were the policy- holders aware of the existence of that august institution, why, each and every one of them would have volunteered some token amount to the furtherance of its aims
Well that's prob'ly true
The Professor, warming, has resumed dry-washing his hands: Yes madam, sadly, the criminal stain is upon my soul, but the benefit shall accrue to any number of worthy causes
As long, that is, as the secret stays with us
And , surely, shall not be the one to divulge it
Mrs
Munson nods, musing
Well
it's hard to see the harm in it
One penny
Her gaze drifts around the room, a smile beginning to warm her face
The smile freezes, though, as her look catches on something
Her : Othar, above the mantle, looks down with a disapproving scowl
'm sorry, Professor
Dorr is taken aback: Excuse me, ma'am
No
It's wrong
Don't you be leadin' me into temptation
Madam,  must strenuously protest-- No, it's just plain wrong
Stealin'
know your intentions were good, and  won't call the police if you give the money back
But  gotta see that you do it
Madam-- And all a you gotta go to church with me next Sunday
The Professor is incredulous: And
engage in divine worship
made up my mind
You can double- talk all you want, but its church or the county jail
But-- She rises
You think it over
gotta feed the cat
-  - The men all sit around the card table, lit from below by an oil lamp
The General is neatly packing the stacks of banknotes into the sackbutt case
Motherfuck
Yes
Unfortunately, Mrs
Munson has rather complicated the situation-- know how to discomplicate it
Put a cap in the old lady's head
Then everything simple again
The group lapses into silence, considering
Even Gawain needs a moment to digest the horror that he himself has proposed
The Professor is solemn: Not easy to do
Many reasons
Practical ones: a quiet neighborhood, a sleepy town
Reasons of moral repugnance: a harmless woman, a deed conceived and executed in cold blood
No, Gawain; would that it were simple
Well -- fuck, man
What we gonna do, give the money back and go to church
shudder
quake
He turns to the General
You sir, are a Buddhist
Is there not a middle way
The General grunts as he closes the clasps on the sackbutt case full of money: Must float like a leaf on the river of life
And kill old lady
The men murmur
Well
suppose you are right
It is the active nature of the crime, though, that so horrifies -- the squeezing of the trigger, the plunging of the knife
But, think a moment -- look at the other tools we have at hand
He looks around
We have the cellar
We have masonry and trowel
Perhaps we could simply
immure her
Sure, easiest thing in the world could whip up a little mortar in one of those snow saucers, lay the bricks, anchor in some chains, Mountain has a source for the manacles
Ahh but gentlemen, we delude ourselves
Think of the woman's piteous moans as we lay tier upon tier of brick
Think of her lamentations as we fit the last brick into place, appealing to our better selves, the higher angels of our nature, our recollections of our own sainted mothers
No,  fear that we lack the sand to commit such an act
No
no
shortest and most painless is best
Let us confront reality
Gawain's gun
the retort muffled by a pillow
into the brain
the affair of an instant
The only question is
who wields the weapon
He looks around the table
Silence
No volunteers
believe it is traditional, in such circumstances, to draw straws
Well, sure, fair enough
He takes a broom leaning against the wall, bends back and snaps a handful of its bristles
'm thinking, though, that since lost my finger --  mean, literally lost it because of that goddamn cat -- maybe  should be excused from this thing
Hard for me to squeeze a trigger anyway-- You one whiney motherfucker
squeeze your nutsack you keep that up
Listen, punk-- Gentlemen, no special pleading, no exceptions
It's in the nature of the situation that we would all prefer to be excused
Pancake grumbles as he counts out five bristles, takes one and snaps it in half, displaying the short straw to the group, and then hands the four long and one short to the Professor: Well, okay
it was just a trial balloon
With a flap of his cape the professor jumbles the straws and encloses them in one hand
Sweaty -
Each man stares at the straws
Some hesitant, some resolute, they draw: First, the General: long straw
His reaction: impassive
Next, Lump: long straw
His reaction: relieved
Next, Pancake
Long straw
Long straw
You all see it
All your fuss over nothing, punk
Two straws left
Gawain stares at them, licks his lips
He reaches for one straw, touches it, hesitates
Motherfucker
He touches the other straw, hesitates
He goes back to the first straw, closes his hand around it, closes his eyes, and pulls
He lifts the straw into frame before his squeezed-shut eyes, raises his eyebrows, and slowly opens fluttering eyelids to look: short straw
The Professor, smiling, opens his fist to confirm that he holds the last long one
Gawain moans
-  - Slowly, slowly, Gawain mounts the cellar stairs
Behind him, gathered in a semi-circle and looking up from the foot of the stairs, the other men wait
As he plants one plodding foot in front of the other Gawain raises the gun, slides back its primer to make sure there is a round in the chamber, and then slides it shut as he reaches the door
-   - In the foreground Mrs
Munson sits knitting, humming an old temperance tune
In the background the cellar door swings open
Marva Munson doesn't notice; her knitting needles continue their rhythmic clack
We  Gawain, gun at the ready, as he takes slow, cautious steps across the floor
We  his  of the back of the old lady's head, bowed over her knitting
As Gawain passes the sofa he picks up a cushion and buries in it his hand holding the gun
He looks back up at the old lady
But now, still cautiously approaching, he cocks his head, his expression bemused
nearing the old lady is now different somehow
The perspective is somewhat lower; the humming woman sounds not quite the same; the rocking chair and the room itself are subtly different
he is a runty, --  walking slowly across the floor; he is cradling not a gun in a pillow but a squirming little puppy dog
The dog yips; the woman turns to look at us
It is not Mrs
Munson, but another black woman of about the same age
What you got there, Gawain
Why -- nothin', mama
Nothin' my ass
You got a dog there
No, Mama
filthy noisy little pest of a puppy dog gonna shit all over the house
He won't shit in the house, Mama, 'm gonna train him,  promise, gonna train him real good-- She cuffs him on the side of his head
'm gonna train you real good told you don't bring no stray dogs into this house
Another slap
You wait til your Daddy gets home, he gonna lay into you proper
The little boy, weeping, throws his arms around his mother: Please don't hurt me no more
love you, Mama
Daddy gonna kick your ass
Bringin' in a filthy dirty dog
Gawain's little brothers and sisters, drawn by the commotion, have gathered excitedly to watch
Mama's whuppin' Gawain's ass
(eagerly) Ain't you gonna use the strap, Mama
Gawain is sobbing: Please don't hurt me, Mama
Now it is the adult Gawain blubbering
The clack of knitting needles stops and Mrs
Munson turns to look
What you doin'
What you doin' with my pillow there
He surreptitiously slides the gun into his pocket, sniveling: 'm sorry, ma'am, -- She cuffs him on the side of the head
'm displeased with you
Colored boy like you, falling in with that trash downstairs
Ashamed a yourself
Didn't your mama raise you right
-  - Gawain is tramping down the stairs
can't do it
The men are stunned
Why
this is most
irregular
She reminds me of my mama
can't shoot my mama
You motherfuckers just draw straws again
Wait a minute
You've got to accept your responsibilities, young man
Fuck you
And your irritated bowel
can't shoot that old lady
Must shoot
Now look here, it's the easiest thing in the world
Pretend her head is a casaba melon, and the gun is a melon- baller, and-- What the fuck you talkin' about, man
You think this a melon-baller, you do it, man
My my, this is most irregular
Look, with equal rights come equal responsibilities-- 'm afraid that Mr
Pancake is right, my dear fellow
We cannot draw straws again; the exercise loses all credibility if you show that the loser can simply beg off doing the job
Must shoot
Gawain shoves the gun toward Pancake
She just an old colored lady to you -- you do it, man
Why you sniveling little coward
What you say, you whiney motherfucker
come up your irritated ass with this -- motherfuckin' gun-- He is waving the gun
You think you scare me, you mewling punk
You don't scare me
Bull Connor and all his dogs didn't scare me
He shoves Gawain
Be a man
You fuck
He shoves him back
Pancake shoves: Be a man
You ain't no fuckin' man, fuckin' a sixty-year-old lady in pigtails
-
They are shoving each other now, getting into it
He lunges at him with a bear hug and his inertia sends both men tumbling to the floor, where they roll and wrestle
Gentlemen, please
seen Virginia hams 'd rather stick my dick in than your old-- muffled gunshot
Quiet
The two men have stopped rolling
They stare at each other where they lie, Pancake on top
At length: Oh my god
Horrified, he slowly rises
think he's hit
The men gather round and look down
Gawain still stares up at the ceiling
Pancake stoops, waves his hand in front of his eyes
No reaction
'll just check the carotid artery
He checks the carotid artery
That's a negative
Oh, fuck
Oh my
Is he dead, Professor
Sure he's dead
checked his carotid artery
Well this is most irregular
We will need a Hefty bag
-   - Creaking open
The Professor, Lump, and the General peek out
The living room is empty but a sliver of the kitchen is visible; its light is on, and we can hear water running
Dorr hisses: She is in the kitchen
shall distract her while you steal out with the carcass
-  - Dorr enters breezily; Mrs
Munson is at the sink, filling a teapot
Dorr positions himself so that, to talk to him, Mrs
Munson has her back to the living room
Well, my dear Mrs
Munson,  have outlined your position to my colleagues and  now return to you to return our collective verdict
Mm-hmm
Behind her, the General peers around the corner and starts a catlike advance across the living room
There was much spirited discussion and an atmosphere of frank give-and- take
Some of our number were initially appalled at your proposal that we simply return the money; some were more receptive
don't care they was receptive or not
And that attitude, madam, was a factor in our discussions
To a man,  must say, they were devastated at the prospect of not being able to contribute to their respective charities
The General signals to Lump who now crosses the living room with a big garbage bag slung over one shoulder in a fireman's carry
Well that is a shame
Indeed
But at the end of the day, your position prevailed, and the men have decided that we shall return the money -- every last cent of it
-- and attend Sunday services, rather than spend the remainder of our years wasting away in the Mississippi Men's Correctional Facility
Though that was the original preference of some
Well 'm glad y'all came to see the light, anyway
'm gonna have some tea and go to bed
The Professor, seeing that the General and Lump have made it out the door, is anxious to wind things up: So the money shall be returned tomorrow at the opening of the casino office
Enjoy your tea, madam
Backing out, he looks to one side
Through the living room window he can see the hearse pulling away from the curb
There is another car -- an old Volkswagon microbus -- slowly tooling the opposite way down the street
Dorr looks back to Mrs
Munson
and congratulations on having recalled to the fold five poor, confused sheep who had momentarily strayed
-  - We are at the middle of the bridge, the tower gargoyle looking blankly down at the doings below
In the misty night Lump and the General are braced over the railing, looking down, each holding one of the feet that protrude from the Hefty bag cinched around Gawain's ankles
cigarette burns on the General's lower lip
Behind the two men we can see the idling hearse
There is the toot of the garbage scow
Lump and the General release Gawain's feet
Their  shows the sack receding and flumping into the garbage piled onto the scow that slips by below
flock of scavenger birds, disturbed by the impact, lifts off the scow with angry caws
-   - Dorr skulks at a corner of the living room's picture window, peering out at the street
- ' The Volkswagon microbus again cruises slowly down the street in the same direction as previously; apparently it has been circling
-   - The Professor scowls
- ' The hearse pulls up to the curb
-  - The Professor clomps down the cellar stairs
Pancake is loading their digging implements into a satchel
They back yet
Dorr is absent: Yes
yes, they just arrived
Pancake straightens from the satchel
Good
'll go dump these in the hearse
He mounts the stairs with a satchel in either hand
We can hear the front door opening as the other men enter
Dorr, bemused, but apparently moved by a hunch, advances slowly to the sackbutt case
He slides the catch that lets its spring clasp pop up
He lifts the lid
Mother Jones magazine
Piles of Mother Jones magazines
What in heaven's name
He riffles a pile, confirming that it is in fact all magazine, no money
Lump and the General are clomping down the stairs
General
- We are  Clark down the street, a satchel in either hand
The microbus, parked halfway down the block, ominously idling
We are  on its side-view mirror
Someone leans from the driver's seat for a view into the mirror, and in the mirror we see her, pigtails swinging: Mountain Girl
Clark Pancake, still rather small, approaching up the empty street
him again
smile is beginning to play at the corners of his mouth
No extra share, huh
The smile abruptly fades
He stops in his tracks for no discernible reason
At length: Nnnrnf
He pants
Behind him, in the deep background, we see the General bounding into the street and silently toward us
Oof
The moment passes
Pancake shakes his head, as if to clear it, and resumes his walk
We are nearing the bus
Mountain Girl sits in the idling bus, waiting
With a thunk and a gentle rock of the bus, we hear its back doors opening, and Pancake's voice
Mountain
Clark
We hear an oof
of exertion as Pancake hoists each of the two satchels into the back
The oofs are followed by: Nnrungh
Aaarmh
Ninnnff
Offffflleghhll
, dear
: to show Pancake being garotted by the General
Nnnnnmmmmfffgh
-  - The tower gargoyle stares sightlessly down
Lump and the General are at their accustomed place, each holding a foot shod in a large hiking boot
Behind them we see the hearse idling
Near them on the bridge, both hands grasping the railing as he gazes dreamily out into the night, is the Professor
"
Like those Nicean barks of yore That gently, o'er a perfumed sea
" We hear the toot of the boat's horn and the men drop the body
Quick
Grab Clark
They quickly stoop and grab another bag-swaddled body out of which even larger hiking boots protrude
"
The weary, wayworn wanderer bore
" They drop the second body
"
To his own native shore
" We hear the distant flump and the cawing of scavenger birds
-  - With three protruding straws
-: Lump picks a long straw: relief
The General picks a short straw
short grunt
Excellent
believe, at last, we have the right man for the job
-
'  - Mrs
Munson lies on her back gently snoring
At the open window, sheers ripple in the evening breeze
large clock ticks upon the mantle
It is almost one o'clock
-   - It creaks open
The General looks stealthily out
cigarette in his mouth plumes smoke
He pushes the door fully open, emerges
-
'  - Mrs
Munson's snore catches on an inhale
She mutters something, sighs, and resumes snoring
-  - The General treads lightly, noiselessly, up the stairway leading to the second floor
He slides one hand into his jacket, pulls out a garotte
With the faintest whoosh he whips it in a complicated loop and snags the other handle with his other hand
-   - The General emerges from the staircase and advances on the closed bedroom door
As he reaches for the knob he performs the no-handed flip of the burning cigarette into his mouth
-
'  - The door swings noiselessly open
The General pauses to survey: The still room
The ticking clock
Mrs
Munson, a large sleeping mound upon the bed
The General advances, raising the garotte in both hands
He closes on her sleeping form
The garotte is lowered toward her exposed neck
It is a foot -- half a foot -- inches-away
Somewhere a muted gear ratchets and triggers the toll of-- The clock, striking one
It is a cuckoo clock but, instead of a bird emerging, a berobed Jesus comes out with his hand resting on the head of a child who gazes up in adoration
The General starts at the noise and then suddenly freezes, his eyes widening
Jesus retreats back into the clock
The General has swallowed his cigarette
He reaches up to his throat, panicked
In a silent frenzy, he yanks loose his ascot
He gazes wildly about
He reaches for the water glass at Mrs
Munson's bedside
He tips it back into his mouth
There is a rattling sound
The uptilted water glass is sending false teeth -- full uppers and lowers -- rattling toward his face
He frantically -- but still noiselessly -- sets the glass back down
Wildly looks about, one hand clamped to his throat
mad but silent dash for the door
-   - Plunging for the head of the stairs-- --a brief yowl from the cat-- --recoiling from where its tail has been stepped on, a hiss and a flash of its claws at the General's leg-- - /  - --and he falls down the stairs, each thudding impact bouncing his body like a rag doll's
At the bottom of the stairs he lies still
- shows his head bent at an unnatural angle, unblinking eyes staring
Traces of smoke wisp from each nostril and his open mouth
Over the mantle, Othar returns the dead man's stare
He looks somewhat smug
-  - The Professor and Lump, responding to the noise, look slowly up toward the ceiling
-  - The body is laid out in a garbage bag by the rail
The Professor stands looking at it, contemplatively
Lump stands looking at it, contemplatively
The cat sits nearby on its haunches looking at it, impassively
The professor muses: 'was our ate brought us to this pass
What, Professor
There is the toot
of an approaching scow
Dorr's manner is still absent, his regard still on the corpse: Our overweening pride
The old woman is a more potent antagonist than one had imagined
He rouses himself, goes over to the bagged corpse
Lump follows him and the two men hoist the body over the rail
Now, Lump, 'm afraid it falls to you to finish the job
They let the body fall onto the scow passing below
The comedy must end
The Professor turns to Lump and tries to hand him Gawain's gun, but Lump, uncomfortable, declines to take it
Professor,  been doing some thinking
Oh dear
Oh dear oh dear oh dear
Maybe she's right
Maybe we should be going to church
Oh dear, Lump
feared that those would be your words
Not that  don't appreciate your giving the matter the benefit of your thought
But please recall, young man, our respective functions in this enterprise
am a professor, the professor as you yourself so often say, the thinker, the "brains of the operation," trained in fact in the arts of cogitation
You, Lump, are the goon, the hooligan, the dumb brute whose actions must be directed by a higher intelligence
Yeah,  know, but-- No buts, dear boy
Do not repeat the error of thinking
Now is the moment of praxis
Now, my dear boy, you must act
Lump reluctantly takes the gun that the Professor thrusts upon him
can't do it, Professor
nice old lady like that
Think of the riches, Lump, that you and  alone shall divide
Recall the dream of wealth untold that first drew you to this enterprise
But-- And reflect also that if you decline to act, forcing me to do so, then you shall no longer have any entitlement to the money
Your offices shall have been nugatory
You mean -- you mean -- you're gonna kill her
Of course
My hand would be forced
can't let you do that, Professor
nice old lady like that
You
Allow
Not allow
What presumption
You stupid boy
You very very extremely stupid boy
We hear the toot of an approaching scow -- this one very long, sustained under all of the following: Oh yeah
He points the gun at the Professor and-- Well who looks stupid now
--squeezes -- click -- on an empty chamber
Huh
He turns the gun to have a look
No bullets
shows the foreshortened barrel as he experimentally squeezes the trigger
: the Professor on the
and, after a sad shake of his head, : Lump in time to see him finish toppling back over the rail
The scow-horn ends
Perhaps
it had to be thus
He goes to the railing to look down
Lump, face-up on a pile of garbage, glides away
Disturbed birds flap upward
The professor muses: "
Lo, in yon brilliant window-niche How statue-like  see thee stand
" His gaze rises with the ascending birds
Among the white gulls is one black bird
The Professor eyes it as it rises past him
Hm
raven
we look down on the Professor, the black bird rising to perch on the gargoyle on the suspension tower in the foreground
The bird settles on a loose, teetering piece of masonry
looking at the receding red light on the bridge of the receding scow: "
The agate lamp within thy hand
The teetering chunk of masonry tips away and the perchless bird flaps off
very dreamy: he sees something in the distance, beyond time and space: Ah, Psyche
from the regions which Are Holy land
" This is punctuated by the crunching impact of masonry scoring a direct hit on his head
He falls over the rail
His cape snags on the railing and he hangs limp and lifeless
Directly below his dangling body the stern of Lump's barge is slipping away to leave black waters and the clanking of chains
The fabric of the Professor's cape begins to tear
His body drops in fits and starts as the fabric gives way
Finally the body rips free
It falls away from us
As it does so the clanking chains are pulling into view the second- banger -- a garbage barge being chain-towed by the receding scow
Dorr's body lands neatly on the barge
gust of wind
The cape flaps free of the railing and is wind-tossed away amidst the cawing birds
The cat, watching, blinks
-
'  - It is resting on the very edge of the night table -- protruding, in fact, past the table's edge
It is morning
We hear rustling from the bed
Hands reach   and hesitate, finding the glass empty of water and precariously perched
(
) Hmm
The hands tip the glass and take the teeth
We hear complicated oral noises
- The door opens away to reveal the morning paper lying on the stoop
Mrs
Munson leans   to pick it up and we as she straightens to have a look: The headline says: $2
6 The subhead:
Mm-hm
-  - Mrs
Munson is walking down the stairs
Professor
She stops midway down and looks: The empty cellar
Money stacked neatly on the card table
Mrs
Munson sadly shakes her head
Hmm
Couldn't face the music
- Mrs
Munson is climbing the porch in her Sunday best
She feints at the dog who lies curled in the sun: Scoot now
Outa the way
- The sheriff is busy on the phone; there is a  today also on the phone
The sheriff, seeing Mrs
Munson enter, covers the phone with one hand
Miz Munson
Sheriff,  gotta make a statement
Could it possibly wait, ma'am
We're a little busy today
guess it can wait, but it's about that casino money
The sheriff exchanges a significant look with the deputy, then murmurs into the phone: Call you right back
He cradles the phone and smiles at Mrs
Munson
You know something about it
Something
Everything
got it at home
You
you have what at home, now
The money
Two point six million dollars
Down in my root cellar
All stacked up nice and neat
Mm-hmm
The deputy pauses to look up from his phone: How'd it get there, Marva
Bunch a desperate men that stole it put it there, that's how
They was musicians of the Renaissance period, played the sackbutt and so on -- well, it turns out they really couldn't play, although they could recite poems to break your heart
Their ringleader speaks in dead tongues
Does he now
tried to get you to see him
That night
Oh yes
had to yell at 'em 'bout stealin' all that money and  guess  made 'em feel pretty bad 'cause they picked up and left without takin' the money
But  was peeved with 'em, Sheriff, they'd been up to all sorts of mischief, come close to blowin' up the house, disturbed Othar no end
Angry, was he
Wouldn't you be
All that racket
expect so
And they let Pickles out too
The sheriff sighs
So you want us to go fetch him
No, he's back, but what you want me to do with the money
Well
He and the deputy exchange looks
The sheriff looks back at Mrs
Munson
Why don't you just keep it, Miz Munson
Keep it
You keep it, Marva
Well
know it's only a penny offa everybody's policy
How's that ma'am
know folks don't much care
Could You s'pose  could
Yes ma'am
Could  give it all to Bob Jones University
That'd be nice, ma'am
She picks up her handbag and heads for the door
Well, long as everybody knows
Thank you for the information, ma'am
You're welcome, sheriff
Just doin' my duty
,  - Mrs
Munson is walking home
It is a beautiful spring day
From far off, wafting toward us on the breeze, we can hear the church chorus singing
Mrs
Munson joins in
She has a strong voice: Leaning, Leaning, Safe and secure from all harm
Lean on Jesus, Lean on Jesus, Leaning on the everlasting arm
She turns up the walk to her house
What a fellowship, What a peace of mind, Safe and secure from all harm
Lean on Jesus, Lean on Jesus, Leaning on the everlasting arm
When she opens the front door the cat slips out
Pickles
It races off down the street
Pickles
-  - Pickles scurries along the walkway
We hear the toot
of an approaching scow
The cat reaches the middle of the bridge
He sticks his head through the bars of the railing
When we   on the cat as he looks down at the water, we see that he holds in his mouth a human finger
As the scow passes underneath, the cat opens its mouth and lets the finger drop
The finger falls away and is barely visible by the time it hits the scow
The cat looks up   , and blinks
Its sideways irises adjust
The scow is gliding away
With the low mournful toot of its horn we tilt up the river to the great garbage island where scavenger birds pick through the trash
