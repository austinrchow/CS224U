celebration
Close friends, cop friends, family all here to celebrate patrolman  ' promotion to detective,
The party spills through the house -- front room, dining room, kitchen, with a small fenced backyard visible beyond that
community of cops on their off-hours, their wives, kids
mix of generations, all the way from ' kid, , and his , playing among the adults, to an elderly woman observing quietly from her chair at the side
The mood's warm, spirited; there's a lot of friendship here

(calling to his wife, for a family portrait) Ellie
'mon
Over here
:  , ' wife of fifteen years, a local product, bright and lively, and clearly proud as hell of her man
She frees herself from the crush of friends, hurrying to join him
:  ,  giving him a full-mouthed smack on the lips as he hooks her into his arms
The picture's snapped, to a chorus of hoots and hollers
Behind, a banner and poster blowup of Mike in gun and uniform read:  " '  , " , a patrolman with the 117th and one of ' best pals, puts his hand vigorously, in congratulations, on '

You'll never know
Manhattan
The Upper East Side, East 59th to 96th
The  stares, impressed
(to the others) Remember Curran from the Sixteenth
He posted a coupla months there on a floater outside the French embassy
He met Jackie Kennedy
Curran, that fuckin' noodlehead
He probably wrote her up for letting her dog dump on Rockefeller's doorstep
, trying to swallow a mouthful of potato salad as a plump and pretty middle-aged woman ( ) pulls him into a bear hug, planting a kiss on him
Mmmmmm-glimmmeee-kisss
'm so proud of you
What the hell took you so long
Hey, don't ask me
Ask the man who put in the good word
, Helen's husband, Mike's best friend
He's forty, stocky, looks up, horsing around with some of the kids in the next room
If
didn't push for me,  never would've made it
Bet your ass
give you six weeks before you're back on the beat, Keegan, they got no room for hero cops
Appreciate, that vote of confidence, Brook
Hey, am  supportive, or what

She shrieks a laugh, toppling off

That wouldn't be too difficult

He  at their blank stares

as he moves on out with his beers

Yeah, but he's my dork

Too kinky

in bed, thoughtful, a happy man
Ellie, you know  think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own
We can afford it now

The club's private entrance looks like what it once was, a shuttered porno bookstore, and the joke's not lost on most of the formal , arriving through the -rated doorway

It's a breathtaking multi-leveled theater of light, sound and dance
There is also an entrance-by-invitation-only grand salon
The  arriving here for the Met gala enter almost in enchanted procession, each of them being personally greeted by the primary owner and manager of the club, , a charming, rakish ex-preppy

This is his element and his club, a son of old money, and a crossover creature to the fast life
Hi

It's really extraordinary

Hello, Win
And he embraces her

He grins broadly, taking ' hand; then right back to Of the filthy rich Steinharts
Why is it Claire always connects with the richest men this side of Saudi
(to Win; meaning the club) This gives new meaning to the word nightlife
acknowledges the obligatory compliment with a closed smile, impatiently returning to : 'mon, let's get outa this lowbrow rag trade

The music, noise, other conversations can still be heard as they walk through the club
He smiles, mid-conversation; there's a real affection here
Skiddy and Kit
haven't seen them since that shitty pasta dinner on the cape
They've got two monsters now
Both boys
And so what's with Steinhart
Is it serious
You didn't like him
Looks a little constipated to me
(needling him) It's called "solid"
Nice to find someone you can count on, Win
: -  -  - entering, a rush,  and  from the alley outside; the throbbing new  overhead
Immaculate as always, in a conservatively-cut European pinstripe,  strides tautly into the shabby corridors
: -   - shows  the main dance floor below, sound-filled and crowded, private and paying  mixing, indistinguishable now
He raises his voice to be heard
The main floor stays public
The side rooms we try to keep available for special functions like tonight
He turns and takes her arm
It's terrific Win
You still writing the occasional magazine article
Occasionally
Then c'mon
Follow me
The art's in the basement, you're going to get a privileged peek
He leads her to the freight elevator

It looks like it's going to be a long conversation

He turns as she's engulfed, heading towards the elevator, runs into , ' escort

Where's she go
Probably found somebody nicer

You're great
He smiles, entering the elevator and disappearing from view

- The elevator reaches bottom
exits into an area of tall rows of stacked boxes still awaiting unloading
Beyond, a bright, high-ceilinged linen whiteness gleams
It's a soon-to-be restaurant-gallery area
The walls have already been painted white
Tables have been positioned
Chairs are stacked, waiting
So are mounds of folded laundry and tablecloths, boxes of accessories, glass and dish and kitchenware, etc
Except for , the elderly stock boy, the bright silence is empty

Several tablefuls of unloaded servers, kitchen utensils, etc

She smiles graciously and steps into the freight elevator, pushing the down button
The doors close

Ahead,  crosses on his way to the offices
The elderly   doesn't see , but  sees him, realizing where else to look here

Music and crowd noise still vibrate

Read the contract
There's ample provision
Fuck the contract

The doors open

Nobody would've touched you
You're making an eighty percent return
Which is what you wanted

Don't turn away when 'm talking to you

Venza slashes another

Bad fuckin' news
Even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands
But he knows where a lot of bodies are buried
It'd cap it for Garber if he could bring him in
(returning, re: the crowd) Okay, let's find out what we know
Herd'm up and check'm out
Anybody know more than gossip about the deceased or Venza,  wanna talk to them myself
Go

Okay, will all the beautiful people shut the fuck up, before it starts gettin' real ugly here
The uniformed  take their cue, moving in for quiet

Just sit and look impressive
Make her feel protected
And if you can get her boyfriend outa my hair, 'll promote you to fuckin' Joint Chiefs

Quit playing with yourself, Keegan

It is an almost storybook vision of beauty that emerges from the darkness around her; her vulnerability penetrates to the very core
(to Claire) You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer
She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness
Could  ask you to step outside, please
No,  will not step outside
Sir,  am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone
Help me out here, could you please leave

It's okay
've never been a detective before either
She lifts her gaze quizzically, catching his smile
She returns it in spite of herself, disarmed by his frankness, and curiously reassured
We'll go slow
Okay
We'll get through it together

don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it
(puzzled) just sat and listened
Safe and secure is how we want her
Until she

has joined them
Venza's either going to skip or try to get to her and Venza likes it here
want her ass covered, 24 hour protection, but  don't want her to know there is any real danger
don't like what 'm hearing
(to Garber) don't understand
If there's any danger, why not just level with her

When she realizes there's a killer tryin' to shut her up, she'll be on the next plane for Tahiti

Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail
Even Joey Venza
He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move
We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in

What do you think
He nods, trying hard to "be there," but  isn't fooled; she assesses him with concern
Honey
You got him
don't know that Ellie
He might get out
Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be
(the voice of sanity) She's got to identify him
Why
(taken aback) Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective --  think she's got a lot of guts

No

Ninety-seven five right
Where'd you get the tie
He's wearing the tie  bought him

She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one
She took you shopping for a tie

What's wrong with your paisley tie
Ellie, it was a formal party
Excuse me
You went to a party with her

Did she buy it or did you
She bought it
Why

(joking) No,  don't want the 'fuckin'" tie -- 'm sorry -- (conciliatory) 'm glad she bought you a tie
You needed one
You look good in that tie

Just checking to see if you're here

An awkward silence
You all right
Yeah
'm sorry about what happened
Listen, that was my fault
(disagreeing) shouldn't have listened to you, should've followed you right into the "can" the way he did
If  had known  was going to have company, he was right next to me think he heard me peeing
hate that,  am glad he's in jail
She laughs, he smiles, both attempting to make light of it
But it's hard to make light of; the attempt quickly fades
Lieutenant Garber says when identify him, they're going to lock him up and throw away the key
nods; buttoning his lip
guess 'm supposed to do it in the morning
Identify him
(uneasy) Sooner, the better
He said he'd kill me
Big talk
Desperate guy
Right
How could he do that if he's in jail and they've thrown away the key

It's the right thing to do
Identifying him
She starts to walk away

No kidding
In the  that follows, their eyes on each other, appraising
So, this could be your last night, huh
Could be,  guess
(a thought) Want to go out for a drink

Where you go, follow

(laughing) You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way
Absolutely
Look at this
He demonstrates a peculiar walk; arms and legs moving in ridiculous awkwardness
That's the dumbest walk  ever saw
(indignant) No, no seriously
There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid
(mock anger) Hey
This is my business
Do tell you your business
Okay
Let's just see if a mugger gets me

No dog
But "nice"
Very nice
Her envy is plain

She steps out first, he follows
She moves to the doors and stops -- her shoulders visibly relaxing as he moves up behind her
But he stops, too
And she turns
:  Both captive to indecision
It is he who makes it, just by staying immobile for too long
She smiles and takes off her coat, holding it out to him
And in the moment of exchange is the return to reality
Good night, Mike

No response;  having trouble with it

Unable to hide his own
She looks at him -- and knowing him as well as she does, is certain
She puts a hand in front of her mouth in an attempt not to cry

Quit looking at me like that
What's with this ridiculous silence
