American Heritage Dictionary: New College Edition normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles
It's about 9:00 in the morning
While the place isn't jammed, there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching on bacon and eating eggs
Two of these people are a   and a
The Young Man has a slight working-class English accent and, like his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're going out of style
It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or how old she is; everything she does contradicts something she did
The boy and girl sit in a booth
Their dialogue is to be said in a rapid pace "  " fashion
No, forget it, it's too risky
'm through doin' that shit
You always say that, the same thing every time: never again, 'm through, too dangerous
know that's what  always say
'm always right too, but but you forget about it in a day or two - yeah, well, the days of me forgittin' are over, and the days of me rememberin' have just begun
When you go on like this, you know what you sound like
sound like a sensible fucking man, is what  sound like
You sound like a duck
(imitates a duck) Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack
Well take heart, 'cause you're never gonna hafta hear it again
Because since 'm never gonna do it again, you're never gonna hafta hear me quack about how 'm never gonna do it again
After tonight
The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in there, back and forth
(with a smile) Correct
got all tonight to quack
comes by with a pot of coffee
Can  get anybody anymore coffee
Oh yes, thank you
The Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee
The Young Man lights up another cigarette
'm doin' fine
The Waitress leaves
The Young Man takes a drag off of his smoke
The Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her coffee
The Young Man goes right back into it
mean the way it is now, you're takin' the same fuckin' risk as when you rob a bank
You take more of a risk
Banks are easier
Federal banks aren't supposed to stop you anyway, during a robbery
They're insured, why should they care
You don't even need a gun in a federal bank
heard about this guy, walked into a federal bank with a portable phone, handed the phone to the teller, the guy on the other end of the phone said: "We got this guy's little girl, and if you don't give him all your money, we're gonna kill 'er
" Did it work
Fuckin'  it worked, that's what 'm talkin' about
Knucklehead walks in a bank with a telephone, not a pistol, not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone, cleans the place out, and they don't lift a fuckin' finger
Did they hurt the little girl
don't know
There probably never was a little girl  the point of the story isn't the little girl
The point of the story is they robbed the bank with a telephone
You wanna rob banks
'm not sayin'  wanna rob banks, 'm just illustrating that if we did, it would be easier than what we been doin'
So you don't want to be a bank robber
Naw, all those guys are goin' down the same road, either dead or servin' twenty
And no more liquor stores
What have we been talking about
Yeah, no more-liquor-stores
Besides, it ain't the giggle it usta be
Too many foreigners own liquor stores
Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't fuckin' speak English
You tell 'em: "Empty out the register," and they don't know what it fuckin' means
They make it too personal
We keep on, one of those gook motherfuckers' gonna make us kill 'em
'm not gonna kill anybody
don't wanna kill anybody either
But they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us of them
And if it's not the gooks, it these old Jews who've owned the store for fifteen fuckin' generations
Ya got Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the counter with a fuckin' Magnum
Try walkin' into one of those stores with nothin' but a telephone, see how far it gets you
Fuck it, forget it, we're out of it
Well, what else is there, day jobs
(laughing) Not this life
Well what then
He calls to the Waitress
Garcon
Coffee
Then looks to his girl
This place
The Waitress comes by, pouring him some more
(snotty) "Garcon" means boy
She splits
Here
It's a coffee shop
What's wrong with that
People never rob restaurants, why not
Bars, liquor stores, gas stations, you get your head blown off stickin' up one of them
Restaurants, on the other hand, you catch with their pants down
They're not expecting to get robbed, or not as expecting
(taking to idea) bet in places like this you could cut down on the hero factor
Correct
Just like banks, these places are insured
The managers don't give a fuck, they're just tryin' to get ya out the door before you start pluggin' diners
Waitresses, forget it, they ain't takin' a bullet for the register
Busboys, some wetback gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour gonna really give a fuck you're stealin' from the owner
Customers are sittin' there with food in their mouths, they don't know what's goin' on
One minute they're havin' a Denver omelet, next minute somebody's stickin' a gun in their face
The Young Woman visibly takes in the idea
The Young Man continues in a low voice
See,  got the idea last liquor store we stuck up
'Member all those customers kept comin' in
Yeah
Then you got the idea to take everybody's wallet
Uh-huh
That was a good idea
Thanks
We made more from the wallets then we did the register
Yes we did
lot of people go to restaurants
lot of wallets
Pretty smart, huh
The Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new information
She sees all the  eating, lost in conversations
The tired , taking orders
The  going through the motions, collecting dishes
The  complaining to the about something
smiles breaks out on the Young Woman's face
Pretty smart
(into it) 'm ready, let's go, right here, right now
Remember, same as before, you're crowd control,  handle the employees
Got it
They both take out their
32-caliber pistols and lay them on the table
He looks at her and she back at him
love you, Pumpkin
love you, Honey Bunny
And with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons, stand up and rob the restaurant
Pumpkin's robbery persona is that of the in-control professional
Honey Bunny's is that of the psychopathic, hair-triggered, loose cannon
(yelling to all) Everybody be cool this is a robbery
Any of you fuckin' pricks move and 'll execute every one of you motherfuckers
Got that
: : " " '74  () An old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 Chevy Nova down a homeless-ridden street in Hollywood
In the front seat are two young fellas  one white, one black  both wearing cheap black suits with thin black ties under long green dusters
Their names are   (white) and (black)
Jules is behind the wheel
Okay now, tell me about the hash bars
What so you want to know
Well, hash is legal there, right
Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a hundred percent legal
mean you can't walk into a restaurant, roll a joint, and start puffin' away
You're only supposed to smoke in your home or certain designated places
Those are hash bars
Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's legal to buy it, it's legal to own it and, if you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it
It's legal to carry it, which doesn't really matter 'cause  get a load of this  if the cops stop you, it's illegal for this to search you
Searching you is a right that the cops in Amsterdam don't have
That did it, man  'm fuckin' goin', that's all there is to it
You'll dig it the most
But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is
What
It's the little differences
lotta the same shit we got here, they got there, but there they're a little different
Examples
Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer in a movie theatre
And  don't mean in a paper cup either
They give you a glass of beer, like in a bar
In Paris, you can buy beer at MacDonald's
Also, you know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris
They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese
No, they got the metric system there, they wouldn't know what the fuck a Quarter Pounder is
What'd they call it
Royale with Cheese
(repeating) Royale with Cheese
What'd they call a Big Mac
Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac
Le Big Mac
What do they call a Whopper
dunno,  didn't go into a Burger King
But you know what they put on french fries in Holland instead of ketchup
What
Mayonnaise
Goddamn
seen 'em do it
And  don't mean a little bit on the side of the plate, they fuckin' drown 'em in it
Uuccch
: () The trunk of the Chevy  , Jules and Vincent reach inside, taking out two
45 Automatics, loading and cocking them
We should have shotguns for this kind of deal
How many up there
Three or four
Counting our guy
'm not sure
So there could be five guys up there
It's possible
We should have fuckin' shotguns
They  the trunk
: Vincent and Jules, their long matching overcoats practically dragging on the ground, walk through the courtyard of what looks like a hacienda-style Hollywood apartment building
We  alongside
What's her name
Mia
How did Marsellus and her meet
dunno, however people meet people
She usta be an actress
She ever do anything  woulda saw
think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot
What's a pilot
Well, you know the shows on
don't watch
Yes, but you're aware that there's an invention called television, and on that invention they show shows
Yeah
Well, the way they pick the shows on is they make one show, and that show's called a pilot
And they show that one show to the people who pick the shows, and on the strength of that one show, they decide if they want to make more shows
Some get accepted and become  programs, and some don't, and become nothing
She starred in one of the ones that became nothing
They enter the apartment building
( ) Vincent and Jules walk through the reception area and wait for the elevator
You remember Antwan Rockamora
Half- black, half-Samoan, usta call him Tony Rocky Horror
Yeah maybe, fat right
wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat
He's got a weight problem
What's the nigger gonna do, he's Samoan
think  know who you mean, what about him
Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up good
And word around the campfire, it was on account of Marsellus Wallace's wife
The elevator arrives, the men step inside
What'd he do, fuck her
No no no no no no no, nothin' that bad
Well what then
He gave her a foot massage
foot massage
Jules nods his head: "Yes
" That's all
Jules nods his head: "Yes
" What did Marsellus do
Sent a couple of guys over to his place
They took him out on the patio of his apartment, threw his ass over the balcony
Nigger fell four stories
They had this garden at the bottom, enclosed in glass, like one of them greenhouses  nigger fell through that
Since then, he's kinda developed a speech impediment
The elevator doors open, Jules and Vincent exit
That's a damn shame
in front of Jules and Vincent as they make a beeline down the hall
Still  hafta say, play with matches, ya get burned
Whaddya mean
You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's new bride a foot massage
You don't think he overreacted
Antwan probably didn't expect Marsellus to react like he did, but he had to expect a reaction
It was a foot massage, a foot massage is nothing,  give my mother a foot massage
It's laying hands on Marsellus Wallace's new wife in a familiar way
Is it as bad as eatin' her out no, but you're in the same fuckin' ballpark
Jules stops Vincent
Whoa
whoa
whoa
stop right there
Eatin' a bitch out, and givin' a bitch a foot massage ain't even the same fuckin' thing
Not the same thing, the same ballpark
It ain't no ballpark either
Look maybe your method of massage differs from mine, but touchin' his lady's feet, and stickin' your tongue in her holyiest of holyies, ain't the same ballpark, ain't the same league, ain't even the same fuckin' sport
Foot massages don't mean shit
Have you ever given a foot massage
Don't be tellin' me about foot massages  'm the foot fuckin' master
Given a lot of 'em
Shit yeah
got my technique down man,  don't tickle or nothin'
Have you ever given a guy a foot massage
Jules looks at him a long moment  he's been set up
Fuck you
He starts walking down the hall
Vincent, smiling, walks a little bit behind
How many
Fuck you
Would you give me a foot massage 'm kinda tired
Man, you best back off, 'm gittin' pissed  this is the door
The two men stand in front of the door numbered "49
" They whisper
What time is it
(checking his watch) Seven-twenty-two in the morning
It ain't quite time, let's hang back
They move a little away from the door, facing each other, still whispering
Look, just because  wouldn't give no man a foot massage, don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwan off a building into a glass- motherfuckin-house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks
That ain't right, man
Motherfucker do that to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause 'd kill'a motherfucker
'm not sayin' he was right, but you're sayin' a foot massage don't mean nothing, and 'm sayin' it does
've given a million ladies a million foot massages and they all meant somethin'
We act like they don't, but they do
That's what's so fuckin' cool about 'em
This sensual thing's goin' on that nobody's talkin about, but you know it and she knows it, fuckin' Marsellus knew it, and Antwan shoulda known fuckin' better
That's his fuckin' wife, man
He ain't gonna have a sense of humor about that shit
That's an interesting point, but let's get into character
What's her name again
Mia
Why you so interested in big man's wife
Well, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida and when he's gone, he wants me to take care of Mia
Take care of her
Making a gun out of his finger and placing it to his head
Not that
Take her out
Show her a good time
Don't let her get lonely
You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace out on a date
It ain't a date
It's like when you and your buddy's wife go to a movie or somethin'
It's just
you know
good company
Jules just looks at him
It's not a date
Jules just looks at him
( 49) , obviously in over their heads, sit at a table with hamburgers, french fries and soda pops laid out
One of them flips the   on the door, opening it to Jules and Vincent in the hallway
Hey kids
The two men stroll inside
The three young caught-off-guard Guys are: , the black young man, who open the door, will, as the scene progresses, back into the corner
, a young blond-haired surfer kid with a "Flock of Seagulls" haircut, who has yet to say a word, sits at the table with a big sloppy hamburger in his hand
, a white, preppy-looking sort with a blow-dry haircut
Vincent and Jules take in the place, with their hands in their pockets
Jules is the one who does the talking
How you boys doin'
No answer
(to Brett) Am  trippin', or did  just ask you a question
We're doin' okay
As Jules and Brett talk, Vincent moves behind the young Guys
Do you know who we are
Brett shakes his head: "No
" We're associates of your business partner Marsellus Wallace, you remember your business partner dont'ya
No answer
(to Brett) Now 'm gonna take a wild guess here: you're Brett, right
'm Brett
thought so
Well, you remember your business partner Marsellus Wallace, dont'ya Brett
remember him
Good for you
Looks like me and Vincent caught you at breakfast, sorry 'bout that
What'cha eatin'
Hamburgers
Hamburgers
The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast
What kinda hamburgers
Cheeseburgers
No,  mean where did you get'em
MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the- Box, where
Big Kahuna Burger
Big Kahuna Burger
That's that Hawaiian burger joint
heard they got some tasty burgers
ain't never had one myself, how are they
They're good
Mind if  try one of yours
No
Yours is this one, right
Yeah
Jules grabs the burger and take a bite of it
Uuummmm, that's a tasty burger
(to Vincent) Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna Burger
No
Jules holds out the Big Kahuna
You wanna bite, they're real good
ain't hungry
Well, if you like hamburgers give 'em a try sometime
Me,  can't usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian
Which more or less makes me a vegetarian, but  sure love the taste of a good burger
(to Brett) You know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in France
No
Tell 'em, Vincent
Royale with Cheese
Royale with Cheese, you know why they call it that
Because of the metric system
Check out the big brain on Brett
You'a smart motherfucker, that's right
The metric system
(he points to a fast food drink cup) What's in this
Sprite
Sprite, good, mind if  have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down with
Sure
Jules grabs the cup and takes a sip
Uuuuummmm, hit's the spot
(to Roger) You, Flock of Seagulls, you know what we're here for
Roger nods his head: "Yes
" Then why don't you tell my boy here Vince, where you got the shit hid
It's under the be don't remember askin' you a goddamn thing
(to Roger) You were sayin'
It's under the bed
Vincent moves to the bed, reaches underneath it, pulling out a black snap briefcase
Got it
Vincent flips the two locks, opening the case
We can't see what's inside, but a small glow emits from the case
Vincent just stares at it, transfixed
We happy
No answer from the transfixed Vincent
Vincent
Vincent looks up at Jules
We happy
Closing the case
We're happy
(to Jules) Look, what's your name
got his name's Vincent, but what's yours
My name's Pitt, and you ain't talkin' your ass outta this shit
just want you to know how sorry we are about how fucked up things got between us and Mr
Wallace
When we entered into this thing, we only had the best intentions As Brett talks, Jules takes out his gun and  Roger three times in the chest,  him out of his chair
Vince smiles to himself
Jules has got style
Brett has just shit his pants
He's not crying or whimpering, but he's so full of fear, it's as if his body is imploding
(to Brett) Oh, 'm sorry
Did that break your concentration
didn't mean to do that
Please, continue
believe you were saying something about "best intentions
" Brett can't say a word
Whatsamatter
Oh, you were through anyway
Well, let me retort
Would you describe for me what Marsellus Wallace looks like
Brett still can't speak
Jules ,   the card table over, removing the only barrier between himself and Brett
Brett now sits in a lone chair before Jules like a political prisoner in front of an interrogator
What country you from
(petrified) What
"What" ain't no country  know
Do they speak English in "What
" (near heart attack) What
English-motherfucker-can-you-speak- it
Yes
Then you understand what 'm sayin'
Yes
Now describe what Marsellus Wallace looks like
(out of fear) What
Jules takes his
45 and  the barrel  in Brett's cheek
Say "What" again
'mon, say "What" again
dare ya,  double dare ya motherfucker, say "What" one more goddamn time
Brett is regressing on the spot
Now describe to me what Marsellus Wallace looks like
Brett does his best
Well he's
he's
black go on
and he's
he's
bald does he look like a bitch
(without thinking) What
Jules' eyes go to Vincent, Vincent smirks, Jules rolls his eyes and  Brett in the shoulder
Brett , breaking into a /  in the chair
Does-he-look-like-a-bitch
(in agony) No
Then why did you try to fuck 'im like a bitch
(in spasm) didn't
Now in a lower voice
Yes ya did Brett
Ya tried ta fuck 'im
You ever read the Bible, Brett
(in spasm) Yes
There's a passage  got memorized, seems appropriate for this situation: Ezekiel 25:17
"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men
Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children
And  will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers
And you will know my name is the Lord when  lay my vengeance upon you

Thing is Butch, right now you got ability
But painful as it may be, ability don't last
Now that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of life, but it's a fact of life your ass is gonna hafta git realistic about
This business is filled to the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers who thought their ass aged like wine
Besides, even if you went all the way, what would you be

) Now the night of the fight, you may fell a slight sting, that's pride fuckin' wit ya
Fuck pride
Pride only hurts, it never helps
Fight through that shit
'Cause a year from now, when you're kickin' it in the Caribbean you're gonna say, "Marsellus Wallace was right

' Sally LeRoy's is a large topless bar by  that Marsellus owns
Vincent's classic Malibu  into the near empty parking lot and parks next to a white Honda Civic
Vince knocks on the door
The front entrance is unlocked, revealing the Dapper Dan fellow on the inside:
Dave isn't really English, he's a young black man from Baldwin Park, who has run a few clubs for Marsellus, including Sally LeRoy's
Vincent Vega, our man in Amsterdam, git your ass on in here
Vincent, carrying the black briefcase from the scene between Vincent and Jules, steps inside
English Dave  the door in our faces
' The spacious club is empty this time of day
English Dave crosses to the bar, and Vince follows
Where's the big man
He's over there, finishing up some business
' : Butch shakes hands with a huge figure with his back to us
The huge figure is the infamous and as of yet still  Marsellus
(
) Hang back for a second or two, and when you see the white boy leave, go on over
In the meanwhile, can make you an espresso
How 'bout a cup of just plain lo' American
Comin' up
hear you're taking Mia out tomorrow
At Marsellus' request
Have you met Mia
Not yet
English Dave smiles to himself
What's so funny
Not a goddamn thing
Look, 'm not a idiot
She's the big man's fuckin' wife
'm gonna sit across a table, chew my food with my mouth closed, laugh at her jokes and that's all 'm gonna do
English Dave puts Vince's coffee in front of him
My name's Paul, and this is between y'all

Non
While Butch waits for his smokes, Vincent just sips his coffee, staring at him
Butch looks over at him
Lookin' at somethin', friend
ain't your friend, palooka
Butch does a slow turn toward Vincent
What was that
think ya heard me just fine, punchy
Butch turns his body to Vincent, when

Both of her ears are pierced five times
She also sports rings in her lips, eyebrows and nose
'll lend it to you
It's a great book on body piercing
Jody, Vincent and a young woman named  sit at the kitchen table of a suburban house in Echo Park
Even though Vince is at the same table, he's not included in the conversation
You know how they use that gun when they pierce your ears
They don't use that when they pierce your nipples, do they
Forget that gun
That gun goes against the entire idea behind piercing
All of my piercing, sixteen places on my body, every one of 'em done with a needle
Five in each ear
One through the nipple on my left breast
One through my right nostril
One through my left eyebrow
One through my lip
One in my clit
And  wear a stud in my tongue
Vince has been letting this conversation go through one ear and out the other, until that last remark
(interrupting) Excuse me, sorry to interrupt
'm curious, why would you get a stud in your tongue
Jody looks at him and says as if it were the most obvious thing in the world
It's a sex thing
It helps fellatio
That thought never occurred to Vincent, but he can't deny it makes sense
Jody continues talking to Trudi, leaving Vincent to ponder the truth of her statement

Three bags of heroin lie on Lance's bed
Lance and Vincent stand at the foot of the bed
Now this is Panda, from Mexico
Very good stuff
This is Bava, different, but equally good
And this is Choco from the Hartz Mountains of Germany
Now the first two are the same, forty- five an ounce  those are friend prices  but this one
(pointing to the Choco) this one's a little more expensive
It's fifty-five
But when you shoot it, you'll know where that extra money went
Nothing wrong with the first two
It's real, real, real, good shit
But this one's a fuckin' madman
Remember,  just got back from Amsterdam
Am  a nigger
Are you in Inglewood
No
You're in my house
White people who know the difference between good shit and bad shit, this is the house they come to
My shit, 'll take the Pepsi Challenge with Amsterdam shit any ol' day of the fuckin' week
That's a bold statement
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince
This is a seller's market
Coke is fuckin' dead as disco
Heroin's comin' back in a big fuckin' way
It's this whole seventies retro
Bell bottoms, heroin, they're as hot as hell
Vincent takes out a roll of money that would choke a horse to death
Give me three hundred worth of the madman
If it's as good as you say, 'll be back for a thousand
just hope  still have it
Whaddya think of Trudi
She ain't got a boyfriend, wanna hand out an' get high
Which one's Trudi
The one with all the shit in her face
No, that's Jody
That's my wife

No problem
Vincent takes out his case of the works (utensils for shooting up)
You don't mind if  shoot up here
Me casa, su casa
Mucho gracias
Vincent takes his works out of his case and, as the two continue to talk, Vince shoots up
Still got your Malibu
You know what some fucker did to it the other day
What
Fuckin' keyed it
Oh man, that's fucked up
Tell me about it
had the goddamn thing in storage three years
It's out five fuckin' days  five days, and some dickless piece of shit fucks with it
They should be fuckin' killed
No trial, no jury, straight to execution
As he cooks his heroin
just wish  caught 'em doin' it, ya know
Oh man, 'd give anything to catch 'em doin' it
It'a been worth his doin' it, if  coulda just caught 'em, you know what  mean
It's chicken shit
You don't fuck another man's vehicle

The Dusty Springfield song stops
Let's go
' In the past six years, 50's diners have sprung up all over , giving Thai restaurants a run for their money
They're all basically the same
Decor out of an "Archie" comic book, Golden Oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer, saucy waitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the Fats Domino Cheeseburger, or the Wolfman Jack Omelet, and over prices that pay for all this bullshit
But then there's  ', the big mama of 50's diners
Either the best or the worst, depending on your point of view
Vincent's Malibu pulls up to the restaurant
big sign with a neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a red windbreaker towers over the establishment
Underneath the cartoon is the name:  '
Underneath that is the slogan: "Next best thing to a time machine
" What the fuck is this place
This is Jackrabbit Slim's
An Elvis man should love it
Come on, Mia, let's go get a steak
You can get a steak here, daddy-o
Don't be a
Mia draws a square with her hands
Dotted lines appear on the screen, forming a sqaure
The lines disperse
After you, kitty-cat
' Compared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint English pub
Posters from 50's
movies are all over the wall ("  ," "  ," " ," and "  ")
The booths that the patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s cars
In the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor
big sign on the wall states, "No shoes allowed
" Some wannabe beboppers (actually Melrose-types), do the twist in their socks or barefeet
The picture windows don't look out the street, but instead, &  movies of 50's street scenes play behind them
The and  are made up as replicas of 50's icons: , ,  ,  ,  and , and    , wait on tables wearing appropriate costumes
Vincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red '59 Edsel
(their waiter), comes over, sporting a big button on his chest that says: "Hi 'm Buddy, pleasing you please me
" Hi, 'm Buddy, what can  get'cha
'll have the Douglas Sirk steak
How d'ya want it, burnt to a crisp, or bloody as hell
Bloody as hell
And to drink, a vanilla coke
How 'bout you, Peggy Sue
'll have the Durwood Kirby burger bloody  and a five-dollar shake
How d'ya want that shake, Martin and Lewis, or Amos and Andy
Martin and Lewis
Did you just order a five-dollar shake
Sure did
shake
Milk and ice cream
Uh-huh
It costs five dollars
Yep
You don't put bourbon in it or anything
Nope
Just checking
Buddy exits
Vincent takes a look around the place
The  are dancing, the  are biting into big, juicy hamburgers, and the icons are playing their parts
Marilyn is squealing, The Midget is paging Philip Morris, Donna Reed is making her customers drink their milk, and Dean and Jerry are acting a fool
Whaddya think
It's like a wax museum with a pulse rate
Vincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling himself a smoke
After a second of watching him What are you doing
Rollin' a smoke
Here
It's just tobacco
Oh
Well in that case, will you roll me one, cowboy
As he finishes licking it You can have this one, cowgirl
He hands her the rolled smoke
She takes it, putting it to her lips
Out of nowhere appears a Zippo lighter in Vincent's hand
He lights it
Thanks
Think nothing of it
He begins rolling one for himself
As this time, the  of a subway car fills the diner, making everything  and
Marilyn Monroe runs to a square vent in the floor
An imaginary subway train the skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out a squeal
The entire restaurant applauds
Back to Mia and Vincent
Marsellus said you just got back from Amsterdam
Sure did
heard you did a pilot
That was my fifteen minutes
What was it
It was show about a team of female secret agents called "Fox Force Five
" What
"Fox Force Five
" Fox, as in we're a bunch of foxy chicks
Force, as in we're a force to be reckoned with
Five, as in there's one
two
three
four
five of us
There was a blonde one, Sommerset 'Neal from that show "Baton Rouge," she was the leader
Japanese one, a black one, a French one and a brunette one, me
We all had special skills
Sommerset had a photographic memory, the Japanese fox was a kung fu master, the black girl was a demolition expert, the French fox' specialty was sex
What was your specialty
Knives
The character  played, Raven McCoy, her background was she was raised by circus performers
So she grew up doing a knife act
According to the show, she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife
But because she grew up in a circus, she was also something of an acrobat
She could do illusions, she was a trapeze artist  when you're keeping the world safe from evil, you never know when being a trapeze artist's gonna come in handy
And she knew a zillion old jokes her grandfather, an old vaudevillian, taught her
If we woulda got picked up, they woulda worked in a gimmick where every episode  woulda told and ol joke
Do you remember any of the jokes
Well  only got the chance to say one, 'cause we only did one show
Tell me
No
It's really corny
'mon, don't be that way
No
You won't like it and 'll be embarrassed
You told it in front of fifty million people and you can't tell it to me
promise  won't laugh
(laughing) That's what 'm afraid of
That's not what  meant and you know it
You're quite the silver tongue devil, aren't you
meant  wouldn't laugh at you
That's not what you said Vince
Well now 'm definitely not gonna tell ya, 'cause it's been built up too much
What a gyp
Buddy comes back with the drinks
Mia wraps her lips around the straw of her shake
Yummy
Can  have a sip of that
'd like to know what a five-dollar shake tastes like
Be my guest
She slides the shake over to him
You can use my straw,  don't have kooties
Vincent smiles
Yeah, but maybe  do
Kooties  can handle
He takes a sip
Goddamn
That's a pretty fuckin' good milk shake
Told ya
don't know if it's worth five dollars, but it's pretty fuckin' good
He slides the shake back
Then the first of an uncomfortable silence happens
Don't you hate that
What
Uncomfortable silences
Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable
don't know
That's when you know you found somebody special
When you can just shit the fuck up for a minute, and comfortably share silence
don't think we're there yet
But don't feel bad, we just met each other
Well 'll tell you what, 'll go to the bathroom and powder my nose, while you sit here and think of something to say
'll do that
' ( ) Mia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the bathroom sink
Her head jerks up from the rush
(imitating Steppenwolf) said goddamn
' ( ) Vincent digs into his Douglas Sirk steak
As he chews, his eyes scan the Hellsapopinish restaurant
Mia comes back to the table
Don't you love it when you go to the bathroom and you come back to find your food waiting for you
We're lucky we got it at all
Buddy Holly doesn't seem to be much of a waiter
We shoulda sat in Marilyn Monroe's section
Which one, there's two Marilyn Monroes
No there's not
Pointing at Marilyn in the white dress serving a table
That's Marilyn Monroe
Then, pointing at a   in a tight sweater and capri pants, taking an order from a bunch of and that's Mamie Van Doren don't see Jayne Mansfield, so it must be her night off
Pretty smart
have moments
Did ya think of something to say
Actually, there's something 've wanted to ask you about, but you seem like a nice person, and  didn't want to offend you
Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like mindless, boring, getting-to-know- you chit-chat
This sounds like you actually have something to say
Only if you promise not to get offended
You can't promise something like that
have no idea what you're gonna ask
You could ask me what you're gonna ask me, and my natural response could be to be offended
Then, through no fault of my own, woulda broken my promise
Then let's just forget it
That is an impossibility
Trying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility
Is that a fact
Mia nods her head: "Yes
" Besides, it's more exciting when you don't have permission
What do you think about what happened to Antwan
Who's Antwan
Tony Rocky Horror
He fell out of a window
That's one way to say it
Another way is, he was thrown out
Another was is, he was thrown out by Marsellus
And even another way is, he was thrown out of a window by Marsellus because of you
Is that a fact
No it's not, it's just what  heard
Who told you this
They
Mia and Vincent smile
They talk a lot, don't they
They certainly do
Well don't by shy Vincent, what exactly did they say
Vincent is slow to answer
Let me help you Bashful, did it involve the -word
No
They just said Rocky Horror gave you a foot massage
And
No and, that's it
You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror out of a four-story window because he massaged my feet
Yeah
And you believed that
At the time  was told, it seemed reasonable
Marsellus throwing Tony out of a four story window for giving me a foot massage seemed reasonable
No, it seemed excessive
But that doesn't mean it didn't happen heard Marsellus is very protective of you
husband being protective of his wife is one thing
husband almost killing another man for touching his wife's feet is something else
But did it happen
The only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was my hand, when he shook it
met Anwan once  at my wedding then never again
The truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus tossed Tony Rocky Horror out of that window except Marsellus and Tony Rocky Horror
But when you scamps get together, you're worse than a sewing circle
: (into microphone) Ladies and gentlemen, now the moment you've all been waiting for, the worldfamous Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest
Patrons cheer
Ed Sullivan is with Marilyn Monroe, who holds a trophy
One lucky couple will win this handsome trophy that Marilyn here is holding
Marilyn holds the trophy
Now, who will be our first contestants
Mia holds her hand
Right here
Vincent reacts
wanna dance
No, no, no no, no, no, no, no
(overlapping) No, no, no, no, no, no, no
do believe Marsellus, my husband, your boss, told you to take me out and do whatever  wanted, Now,  want to dance
want to win
want that trophy
(sighs) All right
So, dance good
All right, you asked for it
Vincent and Mia walk onto the dance floor, toward Ed Sullivan
(into microphone) Let's hear it for our first contestants
Patrons cheer
Vincent and Mia walk up to the microphone
Now let's meet our first contestants here this evening
Young lady, what is your name
(into microphone) Missus Mia Wallace
(into microphone) And, uh, how 'bout your fella here
(into microphone) Vincent Vega
(into microphone) All right, let's see what you can do
Take it away
Mia and Vincent dance to Chuck Berry's "   "
They make hand movements as they dance
' The front door  open, and Mia and Vincent dance tango- style into the house, singing a cappella the song from the previous scene
They finish their little dance, laughing
Then
The two just stand face to face looking at each other
Was than an uncomfortable silence
don't know what that was
(pause) Music and drinks
Mia moves away to attend to both
Vincent hangs up his overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove
'm gonna take a piss
That was a little bit more information than  needed to know, but go right ahead
Vincent shuffles off to the john
Mia moves to her  player, thumbs through a stack of CDs and selects one: k
d
lang
The speakers   a high energy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to
She dances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's overcoat hanging on the rack
She touches its sleeve
It feels good
Her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch
Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco on some rolling paper
Imitating what he did earlier, licks the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette
Maybe a little too fat, but not bad for a first try
Mia thinks so anyway
Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out his Zippo lighter
She  the lighter against her leg, trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did
What do you know, she did it
Mia's one happy clam
She triumphantly brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up, then   the Zippo closed
The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she takes a long, cool drag
Her hand slides the Zippo back in the overcoat pocket
But wait, her fingers touch something else
Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder inside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance
Wearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her face
(like you would say Bingo
) Disco
Vince, you little cola nut, you've been holding out on me
: ( ' ) Vincent stands at the sink, washing his hands, talking to himself in the mirror
One drink and leave
Don't be rude, but drink your drink quickly, say goodbye, walk out the door, get in your car, and go down the road
Mia has the unbeknownst-to-her heroin cut up into big lines on her glass top coffee table
Taking her trusty hundred dollar bill like a human Dust-Buster, she quickly snorts the fat line
Her head  back
Her hands go to her nose (which feels like it's on fucking fire), something is terribly wrong
Then
the rush hits
Vincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his dialogue with the mirror
It's a moral test of yourself, whether or not you can maintain loyalty
Because when people are loyal to each other, that's very meaningful
Mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but it's like she's trying to crawl with the bones removed from her knees
Blood begins to drip from Mia's nose
Then her stomach gets into the act and she
Vince continues
So you're gonna go out there, drink your drink, say "Goodnight, 've had a very lovely evening," go home, and jack off
And that's all you're gonna do
Now that he's given himself a little pep talk, Vincent's ready for whatever's waiting for him on the other side of that door
So he goes through it
We follow behind Vincent as he walks from the bathroom to the living room, where he finds Mia lying on the floor like a rag doll
She's twisted on her back
Blood and puke are down her front
And her face is contorted
Not out of the tightness of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her face are so relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open
Slack-jawed
Jesus Christ
Vincent moves like greased lightning to Mia's fallen body
Bending down where she lays, he puts his fingers on her neck to check her pulse
She slightly stirs
Mia is aware of Vincent over her, speaking to her
(sounding weird) Mia
What the hell happened
But she's unable to communicate Mia makes a few lost mumbles, but they're not distinctive enough to be called words
Vincent props her eyelids open and sees the story
(to himself) 'll be a son-of-a-bitch
(to Mia) Mia
What did you take
Answer me honey, what did you take
Mia is incapable of answering
He  her face hard
Vincent  up and  to his overcoat, hanging on the rack
He goes through the pockets
It's gone
Vincent makes a beeline to Mia
We follow
(yelling to Mia) Okay honey, we're getting you on your feet
He reaches her and hoists the dead weight up in his arms
We're on our feet now, and now we're gonna talk out to the car
Here we go, watch us walk
We follow behind as he hurriedly walks the practically- unconscious Mia through the house and out the front door
'   () : red needle on a hundred
Vincent driving like a madman in a town without traffic laws, speeds the car into turns and up and over hills
'   () Vincent, one hand firmly on the wheel, the other shifting like Robocop, both eyes staring straight ahead except when he glances over at Mia
Mia, slack-jawed expression, mouth gaping, posture of a bag of water
Vincent takes a cellular phone out of his pocket
He punches a number
' At this late hour,  has transformed from a bon vivant drug dealer to a bathrobe creature
He sits in a big comfy chair, ratty blue gym pants, a worn- out but comfortable tee-shirt that has, written on it, ", ", and a moth-ridden terry cloth robe
In his hand is a bowl of Cap'n Crunch with Crunch Berries
In front of him on the coffee table is a jug of milk, the box the Cap'n Crunch with Crunch Berries came out of, and a hash pipe in an ashtray
On the big-screen  in front of the table is the Three Stooges, and they're getting married
( ) (on ) Hold hands, you love birds
The phone
Lance puts down his cereal and makes his way to the phone
It  again
Jody, his wife,  from the bedroom, obviously woken up
(
) Lance
The phone's ringing
(calling back) can hear it
(
) thought you told those fuckin' assholes never to call this late
(by the phone) told 'em and that's what 'm gonna tell this fuckin' asshole right now
(he answers the phone) Hello, do you know how late it is
You're not supposed to be callin' me this fuckin' late
: Vincent is still driving like a stripe-assed ape, clutching the phone to his ear
during the conversation
Lance, this is Vincent, 'm in big fuckin' trouble man, 'm on my way to your place
Whoa, hold you horses man, what's the problem
You still got an adrenaline shot
(dawning on him) Maybe
need it man,  got a chick she's fuckin'  Doing on me
Don't bring her here
'm not even fuckin' joking with you, don't you be bringing some fucked up pooh-butt to my house
No choice
She's ODin'
Yeah
She's dyin'
Then bite the fuckin' bullet, take 'er to a hospital and call a lawyer
Negative
She ain't my fuckin' problem, you fucked her up, you deal with it are you talkin' to me on a cellular phone
Sorry
don't know you, who is this, don't come here, 'm hangin' up
Too late, 'm already here
At that moment inside Lance's house,   's Malibu coming up the street
Lance hangs up the phone, goes to his curtains and  the cord
The curtains open with a in time to see Vincent's Malibu   on his front lawn and  into his house
The window Lance is looking out of  from the impact
(
) What the hell was that
Lance  from the window, out the door to his front lawn
' Vincent is already out of the car, working on getting Mia out
Have you lost your mind
You crashed your car in my fuckin' house
You talk about drug shit on a cellular fuckin' phone If you're through havin' your little hissy fit, this chick is dyin', get your needle and git it now
Are you deaf
You're not bringin' that fucked up bitch in my house
This fucked up bitch is Marsellus Wallace's wife
Now if she fuckin' croaks on me, 'm a grease spot
But before he turns me into a bar soap, 'm gonna be forced to tell 'im about how you coulda saved her life, but instead you let her die on your front lawn
' in Lance's and Jody's bedroom
Jody, in bed, throws off the covers and stands up
She's wearing a long tee-shirt with a picture of Fred Flintstone on it
We follow  behind her as she opens the door, walking through the hall into the living room
It's only one-thirty in the goddamn mornin'
What the fuck's goin' on out here
As she walks in the living room, she sees Vincent and Lance standing over Mia, who's lying on the floor in the middle of the room
From here on in, everything in this scene is frantic, like a in an emergency ward, with the big difference here being nobody knows what the fuck they're doing
Who's she
Lance looks up at Jody
Get that black box in the bedroom have with the adrenaline shot
What's wrong with her
She's ODing on us
Well get her the hell outta here
(in stereo) Get the fuckin' shot
Don't yell and me
She angrily turns and disappears into the bedroom looking for the shot
into the room with the two men
(to Lance) You two are a match made in heaven
Look, just keep talkin' to her, okay
While she's gettin' the shot,  gotta get a medical book
What do you need a medical book for
To tell me how to do it
've never given an adrenaline shot before
You've had that thing for six years and you never used it
never had to use it
don't go joypoppin' with bubble-gummers, all of my friends can handle their highs
Well then get it
am, if you'll let me
'm not fuckin' stoppin' you
Stop talkin' to me, and start talkin' to her
Lance as he runs out of the living room into a
With a bunch of junk in it
He frantically starts scanning the junk for the book he's looking for, repeating the words, "Come on," endlessly
From   we hear: (
) Hurry up man
We're losin' her
(calling back) 'm looking as fast as  can
Lance continues his frenzied search
Jody in the living room now as she talks to Vincent
(
) What's he lookin' for
(
) dunno, some medical book
Jody calls to
(
) What are you lookin' for
My black medical book
As he continues searching, flipping and knocking over shit, Jody appears in the doorway
Whata're you looking for
My black fuckin' medical book
It's like a text book they give to nurses
never saw a medical book
Trust me,  have one
Well if it's that important, why didn't you keep it with the shot
Lance spins toward her
don't know
Stop bothering me
While you're lookin' for it, that girl's gonna die on our carpet
You're never gonna find it in all this shit
For six months now, 've been telling you to clean this room (
) get your ass in here, fuck the book
Lance angrily knocks over a pile of shit and leaves the heading for the living room
Vincent is bent over Mia, talking softly to her, when Lance reenters the room
Quit fuckin' around man and give her the shot
Lance bends down by the black case brought in by Jody
He opens it and begins preparing the needle for injection
While 'm doing this, take her shirt off and find her heart
Vince rips her blouse open
Jody stumbles back in the room, hanging back from the action
Does it have to be exact
Yeah, it has to be exact
'm giving her an injection in the heart, so gotta exactly hit her in the heart
Well,  don't know exactly where her heart is,  think it's here
Vince points to Mia's right breast
Lance glances over and nods
That's it
As Lance readies the injection, Vincent looks up at Jody
need a big fat magic marker, got one
What
need a big fat magic marker, any felt pen'll do, but a magic marker would be great
Hold on
Jody runs to the desk, opens the top drawer and, in her enthusiasm, she pulls the drawer out of the desk, the contents of which (bills, papers, pens) spill to the floor
The injection is ready
Lance hands Vincent the needle
It's ready, 'll tell you what to do
You're gonna give her the shot
No, you're gonna give her the shot
've never does this before
've never done this before either, and  ain't starting now
You brought 'er here, that means you give her the shot
The day  bring an ODing bitch to your place, then  gotta give her the shot
Jody hurriedly joins them in the huddle, a big fat red magic marker in her hand
Got it
Vincent grabs the magic marker out of Jody's hand and makes a big red dot on Mia's body where her heart is
Okay, what do  do
Well, you're giving her an injection of adrenaline straight to her heart
But she's got a breast plate in front of her heart, so you gotta pierce through that
So what you gotta do is bring the needle down in a stabbing motion
Lance demonstrates a stabbing motion, which looks like "The Shape" killing its victims in ""
gotta stab her
If you want the needle to pierce through to her heart, you gotta stab her hard
Then once you do, push down on the plunger
What happens after that
'm curious about that myself
This ain't a fuckin' joke man
She's supposed to come out of it like (snaps his fingers) that
Vincent lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing motion
He looks down on Mia
Mia is fading fast
Soon nothing will help her
Vincent's eyes narrow, ready to do this
Count to three
Lance, on this knees right beside Vincent, does not know what to expect
One
on Mia's body
Needle raised ready to strike
(
) two
Jody's face is alive with anticipation
in that air, poised like a rattler ready to strike
(
) three
The needle leaves frame,  down hard
Vincent brings the needle down hard,  Mia in the chest
Mia's head is  from the impact
The syringe plunger is pushed down,  the adrenaline out through the needle
Mia's eyes    and she lets out a  cry of the banshee
She   in a sitting position, needle stuck in her chest
Vincent, Lance and Jody, who were in sitting positions in front of Mia,  , scared to death
Mia's scream runs out
She slowly starts taking breaths of air
The other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken to their bones, look to see if she's alright
If you're okay, say something
Mia, still breathing, not looking up at them, says in a relatively normal voice
Something
Vincent and Lance collapse on their backs, exhausted and shaking from how close to death Mia came
Anybody want a beer
: '  () Vincent is behind the wheel driving Mia home
No one says anything, both are still too shaken
' The Malibu pulls up to the front
Mia gets out without saying a word (still in a daze) and begins walking down the walkway toward her front door
(
) Mia
She turns around
Vincent's out of the car, standing on the walkway, a big distance between the two
What are your thoughts on how to handle this
What's yours
Well 'm of the opinion that Marsellus can live his whole live and never ever hear of this incident
Mia smiles
Don't worry about it
If Marsellus ever heard of this, 'd be in as much trouble as you
seriously doubt that
If you can keep a secret, so can
Let's shake on it
The two walk toward each other, holding out their hands to shake and shake they do
Mum's the word
Mia lets go of Vincent's hand and silently makes the see-no- evil, hear-no-evil, and speak-no-evil sign with her hands
Vincent smiles
If you'll excuse me,  gotta go home and have a heart attack
Mia giggles
Vincent turns to leave
You still wanna hear my " " joke
Vincent turns around
Sure, but  think 'm still a little too petrified to laugh
Uh-huh
You won't laugh because it's not funny
But if you still wanna hear it, 'll tell it
can't wait
Three tomatoes are walking down the street, a poppa tomato, a momma tomato, and a little baby tomato
The baby tomato is lagging behind the poppa and momma tomato
The poppa tomato gets mad, goes over to the momma tomato and stamps on him (stamps on the ground) and says: catch up
They both smile, but neither laugh
See ya 'round, Vince
Mia turns and walks inside her house
After Mia walks inside
Vincent continues to look at where she was
He brings his hands to his lips and blows her a kiss
Then exits  leaving it empty
his Malibu and
On the cartoon "
"  Speed is giving a detailed description of all the features on his race car "The Mac-5," which he does at the beginning of every episode
we hear a '
'  (
) Butch
: ' We're in the living room of a modest two bedroom house in Alhambra, California, in the year 1972
' , 35ish, stands in the doorway leading into the living room
Next to her is a man dressed in the uniform of an American Air Force officer
The  is the perspective of a five-year old boy
Butch, stop watching  a second
We got a special visitor
Now do you remember when  told you your daddy dies in a
camp
(
) Uh-huh
Well this here is Capt
Koons
He was in the
camp with Daddy
steps inside the room toward the little boy and bends down on one knee to bring him even with the boy's eyeline
When Koons speaks, he speaks with a slight Texas accent
Hello, little man
Boy  sure heard a bunch about you
See,  was a good friend of your Daddy's
We were in that Hanoi pit of hell over five years together
Hopefully, you'll never have to experience this yourself, but when two men are in a situation like me and your Daddy were, for as long as we were, you take on certain responsibilities of the other
If it had been me who had not made it, Major Coolidge would be talkin' right now to my son Jim
But the way it worked out is 'm talkin' to you, Butch
got somethin' for ya
The Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket
This watch  got here was first purchased by your great-granddaddy
It was bought during the First World War in a little general store in Knoxville, Tennessee
It was bought by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge the day he set sail for Paris
It was your great-granddaddy's war watch, made by the first company to ever make wrist watches
You see, up until then, people just carried pocket watches
Your great-granddaddy wore that watch every day he was in the war
Then when he had done his duty, he went home to your great- grandmother, took the watch off his wrist and put it in an ol' coffee can
And in that can it stayed 'til your grandfather Dane Coolidge was called upon by his country to go overseas and fight the Germans once again
This time they called it World War Two
Your great-granddaddy gave it to your granddad for good luck
Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as good as his old man's
Your granddad was a Marine and he was killed with all the other Marines at the battle of Wake Island
Your granddad was facing death and he knew it
None of those boys had any illusions about ever leavin' that island alive
So three days before the Japanese took the island, your 22-year old grandfather asked a gunner on an Air Force transport named Winocki, a man he had never met before in his life, to deliver to his infant son, who he had never seen in the flesh, his gold watch
Three days later, your grandfather was dead
But Winocki kept his word
After the war was over, he paid a visit to your grandmother, delivering to your infant father, his Dad's gold watch
This watch
This watch was on your Daddy's wrist when he was shot down over Hanoi
He was captured and put in a Vietnamese prison camp
Now he knew if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd be confiscated
The way your Daddy looked at it, that watch was your birthright
And he'd be damned if and slopeheads were gonna put their greasy yella hands on his boy's birthright
So he hid it in the one place he knew he could hide somethin'
His ass
Five long years, he wore this watch up his ass
Then when he died of dysentery, he gave me the watch
hid with uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass for two years
Then, after seven years,  was sent home to my family
And now, little man,  give the watch to you
Capt
Koons hands the watch to Butch
little hand comes into  to accept it
: The 27-year old Butch Coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia: trunks, shoes and gloves
He lies on a table catching a few zzzzzz's before his big fight
Almost as soon as   to him, he wakes up with a start
Shaken by the bizarre memory, he wipes his sweaty face with his boxing glove
His trainer , an older fireplug, opens the door a little, sticking his head in the room
Pandemonium seems to be breaking out behind Klondike in the hallway
It's time, Butch
'm ready
Klondike steps inside, closing the door on the outside
He goes to the long yellow robe hanging on a hook
Butch hops off the table and, without a word, Klondike helps him on with the robe, which says on the back: " "
The two men head for the door
Klondike opens the door for Butch
As Butch steps into the hallway, the Crowd goes apeshit
Klondike closes the door behind him, leaving us in the quiet, empty locker room
: "  " We hear over the black and white title: #1 (
) Well Dan, that had to be the bloodiest and, hands-down, the most brutal fight this city has ever seen
The  of chaos in the b
g
: () taxi is parked in a dark alley next to an auditorium
The sky is '
toward the parked car
The  of the   can be heard coming from inside
#1 (
) Coolidge was out of there faster than 've ever seen a victorious boxer vacate the ring
Do you think he knew Willis was dead
#2 (
) My guess would be yes, Richard could see from my position here, the frenzy in his eyes give way to the realization of what he was doing think any man would've left the ring that fast
: (/) Inside the taxi, behind the wheel, is a female cabbie named young woman, with Spanish looks, sits parked, drinking a steaming hot cup of coffee out of a white styrofoam cup
The Sportscasters continue their coverage
#1 (
) Do you feel this ring death tragedy will have an effect on the world of boxing
#2 (
) Oh Dan, a tragedy like this can't help but shake the world of boxing to its very foundation
But it's of paramount importance that during the sad weeks ahead, the eyes of the remain firmly fixed on the Esmarelda shuts off the radio
She takes a sip of coffee, then hears a  behind her in the alley
She sticks her head out of the car door to see: () window about three stories high opens on the auditorium- side of the alley
gym bag is tossed out into a garbage dumpster below the window
Then, Butch Coolidge, still dressed in boxing trunks, shoes, gloves and yellow robe,  to the dumpster below
'  takes in the strangeness of this sight
Gym bag in hand, Butch  out of the dumpster and to the taxi
Before he climbs in, he takes off his robe and throws it to the ground
( / ) Butch, soaking wet, naked except for trunks, shoes and gloves, in the backseat,  the door
Esmarelda, staring straight ahead, talks to Butch through the rearview mirror: (Spanish accent) Are you the man  was supposed to pick up
If you're the cab  called, 'm the guy you're supposed to pick up
Where to
Outta here
The ignition key is
The engine  to life
The meter is  on
Esmarelda's bare foot  on the gas pedal
() The cab  out of the alley, - on the wet pavement in front of the auditorium at a rapid pace
() Locker room door opens, English Dave fights his way through the pandemonium which is going on outside in the hall, shutting the door on the madness
Once inside, English Dave takes time to adjust his suit and tie
Mia is standing by the door
She sees Vincent with English Dave
Mia
How you doin'
Great
never thanked you for the dinner
In the room, black boxer    lies on a table dead
His face looks like he went dunking for bees
His  is on his knees, head on Floyd's chest, crying over the body
The huge figure that is Marsellus Wallace stands at the table, hand on the Trainer's shoulder, lending emotional support
We still do not see Marsellus clearly, only that he is big
Mia sits in a chair at the far end of the room
Marsellus looks up, sees English Dave and walks over to him
(
) What'cha got
He booked
(
) 'm prepared to scour the earth for this motherfucker
If Butch goes to Indo China,  want a nigger hidin' in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a cap in his ass
'll take care of it
( / ) Butch gets one of his boxing gloves off
Esmeralda watches in the rearview mirror
He tries to roll down one of the backseat windows, but can't find the roll bar
Hey, how do  open the window back here
have to do it
She presses a button and the back window moves down
Butch tosses his boxing glove out the window, then starts untying the other one
Esmeralda can't keep quiet anymore
Hey, mister
(still working on the glove) What
You were in that fight
The fight on the radio  you're the fighter
As he tosses his other glove out the window
Whatever gave you that idea
No c'mon, you're him,  know you're him, tell me you're him
(drying himself with a gym towel) 'm him
You killed the other boxing man
He's dead
The radio said he was dead
He finished wiping himself down
(to himself) Sorry 'bout that, Floyd
He tosses the towel out the window
Silence, as Butch digs in his bag for a t-shirt
What does it feel like
(finds his shirt) What does what feel like
Killing a man
Beating another man to death with your bare hands
Butch pulls on his tee-shirt
Are you some kinda weirdo
No, it's a subject  have much interest in
You are the first person ever met who has killed somebody
So, what was it like to kill a man
Tell ya what, you give me one of them cigarettes, 'll give you an answer
Esmarelda bounces in her seat with excitement
Deal
Butch leans forward
Esmarelda, keeping her eyes on the road, passes a cigarette back to him
He takes it
Then, still not looking behind her, she brings up her hand, a lit match in it
Butch lights his smoke, then blows out the match
He takes a long drag
So
He looks at her license
Esmarelda Villalobos  is that Mexican
The name is Spanish, but 'm Columbian
It's a very pretty name
It mean "Esmarelda of the wolves
" That's one hell of a name you got there, sister
Thank you
And what is your name
Butch
Butch
What does it mean
'm an American, our names don't mean shit
Anyway, moving right along, what is it you wanna know, Esmarelda
want to know what it feels like to kill a man couldn't tell ya
didn't know he was dead 'til you told me he was dead
Now  know he's dead, do you wanna know how  feel about it
Esmarelda nods her head: "yes
" don't feel the least little bit bad
() We  around a phone booth as Butch talks inside
(into phone) What'd  tell ya, soon as the word got out a fix was in, the odds would be outta control
Hey, if he was a better fighter he's be alive
If he never laced up his gloves in the first place, which he never shoulda done, he'd be alive
Enough about the poor unfortunate Mr
Floyd, let's talk about the rich and prosperous Mr
Butch
How many bookies you spread it around with
() Eight
How long to collect
(pause) So by tomorrow evening, you'll have it all
(pause) Good news Scotty, real good news understand a few stragglers aside
Me an'  Fabienne're gonna leave in the morning
It should take us a couple days to get into Knoxville
Next time we see each other, it'll be on Tennessee time
Butch hangs up the phone
He looks at the cab waiting to take him wherever he wants to go
(to himself in French with English subtitles) Fabienne my love, our adventure begins
: ( / ) Esmeralda's taxi pulled into the motel parking lot
The rain has stopped, but the night is still soaked
Butch gets out, now fully dressed in tee-shirt, jeans and high school athletic jacket
He leans in the driver's side window
Forty-five sixty
Handing her the money
Merci beaucoup
And here's a little something for the effort
Butch holds up a hundred dollar bill
Esmarelda's eyes light up
She goes to take it
Butch holds it out of reach
Now if anybody should ask you about who your fare was tonight, what're you gonna tell 'em
The truth
Three well-dressed, slightly toasted, Mexicans
He gives her the bill
Bon soir, Esmarelda
(in Spanish) Sleep well, Butch
He tweaks her nose, she smiles, and he turns and walks away
She drives off
( ) Butch enters and turns on the light
Lying curled up on the bed, fully dressed, with her back to us is Butch's French girlfriend,
Keep the light off
Butch flicks the switch back, making the room dark again
Is that better, sugar pop
Oui
Hard day at the office
Pretty hard
got into a fight
Poor baby
Can we make spoons
Butch climbs into bed, spooning Fabienne from behind
When Butch and Fabienne speak to each other, they speak in babytalk
was looking at myself in the mirror
Uh-huh
wish  had a pot
You were lookin' in the mirror and you wish you had some pot
pot
pot belly
Pot bellies are sexy
Well you should be happy, 'cause you do
Shut up, Fatso
don't have a pot
have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna when she did "Lucky Star," it's not the same thing
didn't realize there was a difference between a tummy and a pot belly
The difference is huge
You want me to have a pot
No
Pot bellies make a man look either oafish, or like a gorilla
But on a woman, a pot belly is very sexy
The rest of you is normal
Normal face, normal legs, normal hips, normal ass, but with a big, perfectly round pot belly
If  had one, 'd wear a tee-shirt two sizes too small to accentuate it
You think guys would find that attractive
don't give a damn what men find attractive
It's unfortunate what we find pleasing to the touch and pleasing to the eye is seldom the same
If you a pot belly, 'd punch you in it
You'd punch me in my belly
Right in the belly
'd smother you
'd drop it on your right on your face 'til you couldn't breathe
You'd do that to me
Yes
Did you get everything, sugar pop
Yes,  did
Good job
Did everything go as planned
You didn't listen to the radio
never listen to your fights
Were you the winner
won alright
Are you still retiring
Sure am
What about the man you fought
Floyd retired too
(smiling) Really
He won't be fighting no more
Not no more
So it all worked out in the finish
We ain't at the finish, baby
Fabienne rolls over and Butch gets on top of her
They kiss
We're in a lot of danger, aren't we
Butch nods his head: "yes
" If they find us, they'll kill us, won't they
Butch nods his head: "yes
" But they won't find us, will they
Butch nods his head: "no
" Do you still want me to go with you
Butch nods his head: "yes
" don't want to be a burden or a nuisance - Butch's hand goes out of frame and starts massaging her crotch
Fabienne reacts
Say it
Fabienne,  want you to be with me
Forever
and ever
Fabienne lies her head back
Butch continues to massage her crotch
Do you love me
Oui
Butch
Will you give me oral pleasure
Butch kisses her on the mouth
Will you kiss it
She nods her head: "yes
" But you first
Butch's head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral pleasure
Fabienne's face is alone in the frame
(in French, with English subtitles) Butch my love, the adventure begins
: Same motel room, except empty
in the bathroom
The   to the bathroom doorway
We see Fabienne in a white terry cloth robe that seems to swallow her up
She's drying her head with a towel
Butch is inside the shower washing up
We see the outline of his naked body through the smoky glass of the shower door
Steam fills the bathroom
Butch turns the shower off and opens the door, popping his head out
think  cracked a rib
Giving me oral pleasure
No retard, from the fight
Don't call me retard
(in a Mongoloid voice) My name is Fabby
My name is Fabby
Shut up fuck head
hate that Mongoloid voice
Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry,  take it back
Can  have a towel please, Miss Beautiful Tulip
Oh  like that,  like being called a tulip
Tulip is much better than Mongoloid
She finishes drying her hair and wraps the towel like a turban on her head
didn't call you a Mongoloid, called you a retard, but  took it back
She hands him a towel
Merci beaucoup
Butch
(drying his head) Yes, lemon pie
Where are we going to go
'm not sure yet
Wherever you want
We're gonna get a lot of money from this
But it ain't gonna be so much, we can live like hogs in the fat house forever
was thinking we could go somewhere in the South Pacific
The kinda money we'll have'll carry us a long way down there
So if we wanted, we could live in Bora Bora
You betcha
And if after awhile you don't dig Bora Bora, then we can move over to Tahiti or Mexico
But  do not speak Spanish
You don't speak Bora Boran either
Besides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta el zapataria
What does that mean
Where's the shoe store
Donde esta el zapataria
Excellent pronunciation
You'll be my little mama ceta in no time
Butch exits the bathroom
We stay on Fabienne as she brushes her teeth
Butch keeps on from the other room
(
) Que hora es
Que hora es
(
) What time is it
What time is it
(
) Time for bed
Sweet dream, jellybean
Fabienne brushes her teeth
We watch her for a moment or two, then she remember something
Butch
She walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only to find him sound asleep in bed
She looks at him for a moment
Forget it
She exits frame, going back in the bathroom
on the of the unconscious Butch in bed
: , the next morning
We find Butch still asleep in bed
Fabienne brushes her teeth half in and half out of the bathroom so she can watch  at the same time
She still wears the terry cloth robe from the night before
:   and a   '  are taking on the entire Vietnamese army in the film " "
Butch wakes from his sleep, as if a scary monster was chasing him
His start startles Fabienne
Merde
You startled me
Did you have a bad dream
Butch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to focus
Butch, still trying to chase the cobwebs away, sees on Hell's Angels tear-assin' through a Vietnamese prison camp
What are you watching
motorcycle movie, 'm not sure the name
Are you watchin' it
Fabienne enters the room
In a way
Why
Would you like for me to switch it off
Would you please
She reaches over and turns off the
It's a little too early in the morning for explosions and war
What was it about
How should  know, you were the one watchin' it
Fabienne laughs
No, imbecile, what was your dream about
Oh,
don't remember
It's really rare  remember a dream
You just woke up from it
Fabienne, 'm not lying to you, don't remember
Well, let's look at the grumpy man in the morning
didn't say you were lying, it's just odd you don't remember your dreams
always remember mine
Did you know you talk in your sleep
don't talk in my sleep, do  talk in my sleep
You did last night
What did  say
Laying on top of him
don't know
couldn't understand you
She kisses Butch
Why don't you get up and we'll get some breakfast at that breakfast place with the pancakes
One more kiss and 'll get up
Fabienne gives Butch a sweet long kiss
Satisfied
Yep
Then get up, lazy bones
Butch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of the suitcase that Fabienne brought
What time is it
Almost nine in the morning
What time does our train arrive
Eleven
'm gonna order a big plate of blueberry pancakes with maple syrup, eggs over easy, and five sausages
(surprised at her potential appetite) Anything to drink with that
Butch is finished dressing
(referring to his clothes) Oh yes, that looks nice
To drink, a tall glass or orange juice and a black cup of coffee
After that, 'm going to have a slice of pie
As he goes through the suitcase
Pie for breakfast
Any time of the day is a good time for pie
Blueberry pie to go with the pancakes
And on top, a thin slice of melted cheese where's my watch
It's there
No, it's not
It's not here
Have you looked
By now, Butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase
Yes 've fuckin' looked
He's now throwing clothes
What the fuck do you think 'm doing
Are you sure you got it
Fabienne can hardly speak, she's never seen Butch this way
Uhhh
yes
beside the table drawer on the little kangaroo
Yes, it was on your little kangaroo
Well it's not here
(on the verge of tears) Well it should be
Oh it most definitely should be here, but it's not
So where is it
Fabienne is crying and scared
Butch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more menacing
Fabienne, that was my father's fuckin' watch
You know what my father went through to git me that watch don't wanna get into it right now
but he went through a lot
Now all this other shit, you coulda set on fire, but  specifically reminded you not to forget my father's watch
Now think, did you get it
believe so
You believe so
You either did, or you didn't, now which one is it
Then  did
Are you sure
(shaking) No
Butch freaks out, he punches the air
Fabienne  and backs into a corner, Butch picks up the motel  and    the wall
Fabienne
Butch looks toward her, suddenly calm
(to Fabienne) No
It's not your fault
(he approached her) You left it at the apartment
He bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor
He touches her hand, she flinches
If you did leave it at the apartment, it's not your fault
had you bring a bunch of stuff
reminded you about it, but  didn't illustrate how personal the watch was to me
If all  gave a fuck about was my watch, should've told you
You ain't a mind reader
He kisses her hand
Then rises
Fabienne is still sniffling
Butch goes to the closet
'm sorry
Butch puts on his high school jacket
Don't be
It just means  won't be able to eat breakfast with you
Why does it mean that
Because 'm going back to my apartment to get my watch
Won't the gangsters be looking for you there
That's what 'm gonna find out
If they are, and  don't think  can handle it, 'll split
Rising from the floor
was so dreadful
saw your watch, thought  brought it
'm so sorry
Butch brings her close and puts his hands on her face
Don't feel bad, sugar pop
Nothing you could ever do would make me permanently angry at you
(pause) love you, remember
(he digs some money out of his wallet) Now here's some money, order those pancakes and have a great breakfast
Don't go
'll be back before you can say, blueberry pie
Blueberry pie
Well maybe not that fast, but fast
Okay
Okay
Okay
He kisses her once more and heads for the door
Bye-bye, sugar pop
Bye
'm gonna take your Honda
Okay
And with that, he's out the door
Fabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her
() Butch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his fists as he drives down the street
Of all the fuckin' things she coulda forgot, she forgets my father's watch
specifically reminded her not to forget it
"Bedside table  on the kangaroo
"  said the words: "Don't forget my father's watch
" The little Honda races toward its destination as fast as is little engine will take it
: parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the arrow pointing at one hour
Butch isn't completely reckless
He has parked his car a couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before he goes boppin' through the front door
Butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street, then he discreetly glances out
' Everything seems normal
More or less the right number of cars in the street
None of the parked cars appear out of place
None of them have a couple of goons sitting inside
Basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of Butch's home
Butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information
Butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything
He crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard
Across the street from Butch's building, on the corner, is a combination donut shop and Japanese restaurant
big sign sticks up in the air, with the name "Teriyaki Donut" and a graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice
' Butch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment building
Once again, everything appears normal  the laundry room, the pool, his apartment door  nothing appears disturbed
Butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12
He steps outside the door and listens inside
Nothing
Butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening it
' His apartment hasn't been touched
He cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick look around
Obviously, no one is there
Butch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the refrigerator
He takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it
With carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment
Then he goes to the bedroom
His bedroom is like the rest of the apartment  neat, clean and anonymous
The only things personal in his room are a few boxing trophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue of "Ring Magazine" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of Jerry Quarry and one of George Chuvalo
Sure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: On the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue
He walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen
He opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts
Putting down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and puts them in the toaster
Butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something
What he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter
(softly) Holy shit
He picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines it
Then
a toilet
Butch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to the kitchen
There is someone behind it
Like a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not knowing what to do
The bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the bathroom, tightening his belt
In his hand is the book " " by Peter 'Donnell
Vincent and Butch lock eyes
Vincent freezes
Butch doesn't move, except to point the M61 in Vincent's direction
Neither man opens his mouth
Then
the toaster  kicks up the Pop Tarts
That's all the situation needed
Butch's finger  the trigger
out of the end of the gun
Vincent is seemingly  with twenty bullets him off his feet,  him through the air and  through the glass shower door at the end of the bathroom
By the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent is annihilated
Butch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened
His look goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once Vincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip
With the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61 back on the kitchen counter
Then he exits the apartment, quickly
Butch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the courtyard
comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street
goes through the alley
and into his car in one
Butch  the car into gear and drives away
The big wide smile of a survivor breaks across his face
The Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his apartment building
Butch looks out the window at his former home
That's how you're gonna beat 'em, Butch
They keep underestimatin' ya
This makes the boxer laugh out loud
As he laughs, he flips a tape in the cassette player
When the  starts, he along with it
He drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on the corner across from Teriyaki Donut
Butch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we see: The big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut, carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam cups of coffee
He steps off the curb, crossing the street in front of Butch's car
This is the first time we see Marsellus clearly
Laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front of him
When Marsellus is in front of Butch's car, he casually glances to his left, sees Butch, continues walking
then
-: "Am  really seeing what 'm seeing
" Butch doesn't wait for the big man to answer his own question
He  on the gas pedal
The little Honda  into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts and the coffee  the pavement at thirty miles an hour
Butch  into cross traffic and is - by a gold Camaro -28,  all the windows in the Honda and sending it up on the sidewalk
Butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what at one time was Fabienne's Honda
Blood flows from his nostrils
The still-functional tape player continues to play
pokes his head inside
Jesus, are you okay
Butch look at him, spaced-out
guess
Marsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street gather around the body
#1 (to the others) He's dead
He's dead
This jerk's yelling makes Marsellus come to
help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage
The woozy Marsellus gets to his feet
#2 If you need a witness in court, 'll be glad to help
He was a drunken maniac
He hit you and crashed into that car
(still incoherent) Who
#2 (pointing at Butch) Him
Marsellus follows the Gawker's finger and sees Butch Coolidge down the street, looking a shambles
Well, 'll be damned
The big man takes out a
45 Automatic and the Gawkers back away
Marsellus starts moving toward Butch
Butch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee-line toward him
Sacre bleu
Marsellus brings up his weapon and , but he's so hurt, shaky and dazed that his arm goes wild
He  a -  in the hip
She falls to the ground, screaming
- Oh my God, 've been shot
That's all Butch needs to see
He's outta here
Marsellus  after him
The  looks agape
Butch is in a mad, limping
The big man's hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run
Butch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a sign that reads "- "
- , a hillbilly-lookin' boy, stands behind the counter of his pawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of Butch  into his world
Can  help you wit' somethin'
Shut up
Butch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands next to the door
Now you just wait one goddamn minute Before Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus  in
He doesn't get past the doorway because Butch  his fist in Marsellus' face
The gangster's feet go out from under him and the big man on his back
Outside, two police cars with their   race by
Butch  on the fallen body,  him twice more in the face
Butch takes the gun out of Marsellus' hand, than grabs ahold of his middle finger
So you like chasing people, huh
He  the finger
Marsellus lets out a pain sound
Butch then places the barrel of the
45 between his eyes, back the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to shield the splatter
Well guess what, big man, you caught me (
) hold it right there, godammit
Butch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who's brandishing a pumpaction shotgun, aimed at the two men
Look mister, this ain't any of your business 'm makin' it my business
Now toss that gun
Butch does
Now you on top, stand up and come to the counter
Butch slowly gets up and moves to the counter
As soon as he gets there, Maynard  ,  him hard in the face with the butt of the shotgun, knocking Butch down and out
After Butch goes down, Maynard calmly lays the shotgun on the counter and moves to the telephone
Marsellus Wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily watches the pawnshop owner dial a number
Maynard waits on the line while the other end rings
Then it picks up
Zed
It's Maynard
The spider just caught a coupl'a flies
Marsellus passes out
: They are tied up in two separate chairs
In their mouths are two &-style ball gags (a belt goes around their heads and a little red ball sticks in their mouths)
Both men are unconscious
Maynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and  both guys until they're wide awake and wet as otters
The two prisoners look up at their captors
Maynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one hand, shotgun in the other, and Marsellus'
45 sticking in his belt
Nobody kills anybody in my place of business except me or Zed
buzzes
That's Zed
Without saying another word, Maynard climbs up the stairs that lead to red curtains and goes through them
, on the other side of the curtains, Maynard let Zed inside the store
Butch and Marsellus look around the room
The basement of the pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon
After taking in their predicament, Butch and Marsellus look at each other, all traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both share at what they've gotten themselves into
Maynard and  come through the curtains
Zed is an even more intense version of Maynard, if such a thing is possible
The two hillbillys are obviously brothers
Where Maynard is a vicious pitbull, Zed is a deadly cobra
Zed walks in and stands in front of the two captives
He inspects them for a long time, then says: (to Maynard) You said you waited for me
did
Then how come they're all beat up
They did that to each other
They was fightin' when they came in
This one was gonna shoot that one
(to Butch) You were gonna shoot him
Butch makes no reply
Hey, is Grace gonna be okay in front of this place
Yeah, it ain't Tuesday is it
No, it's Thursday
Then she'll be fine
Bring out The Gimp
think The Gimp's sleepin'
Well,  guess you'll just wake 'em up then, won't you
Maynard opens a trap door in the floor
(yelling in the hole) Wake up
Maynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a leash
He gives it a rough yank and, from below the floor, rises The Gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black leather bondage gear
There are zippers, buckles and studs here and there on the body
On his head is a black leather mask with two eye holes and a zipper (closed) for a mouth
They keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large dog
Zed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners, then lowers into it
Maynard hands The Gimp's leash to Zed, then backs away
(to The Gimp) Down
The Gimp gets on its knees
Maynard hangs back while Zed appraises the two men
Who's first
ain't fer sure yet
Then with his little finger, Zed does a silent "Eenie, meany, miney, moe
" just his mouth mouthing the words and his finger going back and forth between the two
Butch are Marsellus are terrified
Maynard looks back and forth at the victims
The Gimps's eyes go from one to the other inside the mask
Zed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving left to right, then it stops
After a beat,    to the right, zeroing in on Marsellus
Zed stands up
Wanna do it here
Naw, drag big boy to Russell's old room
Zed grabs Marsellus' chair and  him into Russell's old room
Russell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the misfortune of stumbling into the Mason-Dixie pawnshop
Whatever happened to Russell is known only to Maynard and Zed because his old room, a back room in the back of the back room, is empty
As Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before he disappears behind the door of Russell's old room
(to The Gimp) Up
The Gimp rises
Maynard ties The Gimp's leash to a hook on the ceiling
Keep an eye on this one
The Gimp bows its head: "yes
" Maynard disappears into Russell's old room
There must be a stereo in there because suddenly The Judds, singing in harmony, fills the air
Butch looks at The Gimp
The Gimp giggles from underneath the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history of comedy
From behind the door we hear country , struggling, and: (
) Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight in 'em
We the  Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus
(
) You wanna fight
You wanna fight
Good,  like to fight
Butch pauses, listens to the voices
Then, in a panic, hurriedly struggles to get free
The Gimp is laughing wildly
The ropes are on too tight and Butch can't break free
The Gimp slaps his knee laughing In the back room, we hear: (
) That's it
that's it boy, you're goin' fine
Oooooooh, just like that
that's good
(grunting faster) Stay still
stay still goddamn ya
Zed goddammit, git over here and hold 'em
Butch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms
Then, quite easily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it were never connected by a bolt
The Gimp sees this and its eyes widen
Huhng
The Gimp  , trying to get the leash off the hook
He tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles and grunts
Butch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three ' to its face
The punches knock The Gimp out, making him fall to his knees, this   by the leash attached to the hook, Butch removes the ball gag, then silently makes his way through the red curtains
Butch sneaks to the door
On the counter is a big set of keys with a large  connected to the ring
Grabbing them, he's about to go out when he stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their way with Marsellus
Butch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in a situation like that
Se he begins rooting around the pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in with
He picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards it: Not destructive enough
He picks up a chainsaw, thinks about it for a moment, then puts it back
Next, a large Louisville slugger he tries on for size
But then he spots what he's been looking for: Samurai sword
It hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the wall, next to a neon "' -  " sign
Butch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its sheath
It's a magnificent piece of steel
It seems to glisten in the low-wattage light of the pawnshop
Butch touches his thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show
Not on your life
It's as sharp as it gets
This weapon seems made to order for the Brothers Grimm downstairs
Holding the sword pointed downward, Takakura Kenstyle, he disappears through the red curtains to take care of business
Butch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon
Sodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind the closed door that leads to Russell's old room
' Butch's hand comes into frame, pushing the door open
It swings open silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched positions
Zed is now bent over Marsellus, who is bent over a wooden horse
Maynard watches
Both have their backs to Butch
Maynard faces the , grinning, while Butch comes up behind him with the sword
Miserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, Marsellus, red ball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see Butch coming up behind Maynard
His eyes widen
Hey hillbilly
Maynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword
Butch
with one mighty ,  Maynard across the front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on Zed
Maynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock
Butch, while never taking his eyes off Zed,  the sword behind him,  Maynard, then  it, pointing the blade toward Zed
Maynard
Zed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go from the tip of Butch's sword to Marsellus'
45 Automatic, which lies within reach
Butch's eyes follow Zed's
You want that gun, Zed
Pick it up
Zed's hand inches toward the weapon
Butch  the sword tighter
Zed studies Butch
Butch looks hard at Zed
Then a  says: (
) Step aside, Butch
Butch steps aside,  Marsellus standing behind him, holding Maynard's pump-action shotgun
Zed is  in the groin
Down he goes,  in
Marsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist,  the used shotgun shell
Butch lowers the sword and hangs back
Not a word, until: You okay
Naw man
'm pretty fuckin' far from okay
Long pause
What now
What now
Well let me tell you what now
'm gonna call a couple pipe- hittin' niggers, who'll go to work on homes here with a pair of pliers and a blow torch
(to Zed) Hear me talkin' hillbilly boy ain't through with you by a damn sight
'm gonna git Medieval on your ass
meant what now, between me and you
Oh, that what now
Well, let me tell ya what now between me an' you
There is no me an' you
Not no more
So we're cool
Yeah man, we're cool
One thing ask  two things  ask: Don't tell nobody about this
This shit's between me and you and the soon-to-be-livin'- the-rest-of-his-short-ass-life-in- agonizing-pain, Mr
Rapist here
It ain't nobody else's business
Two: leave town
Tonight
Right now
And when you're gone, stay gone
You've lost your Los Angeles privileges
Deal
Deal
The two men shake hands, then hug one another
Go on now, get your ass outta here
Butch leaves Russell's old room through the red curtains
Marsellus walks over to a phone, dialing a number
(into the phone) Hello Mr
Wolf, it's Marsellus
Gotta bit of a situation
- Butch, still shaking in his boots, exits the pawnshop
He looks ahead and sees, parked in front of the establishment, Zed's Big Chrome Chopper with a teardrop gas tank that has the name "" on it
He climbs aboard, takes out the keys with the big  on them and starts up the huge hog
It to life, making sounds like a rocket fighting for orbit
Butch twists the accelerator handle and  off
' Fabienne stands in front of a mirror wearing a "Frankie says, Relax" tee-shirt, singing along with  coming from a () Butch drives down the street, humping a hot hog named "
" He checks his father's watch
It says: 10:30
The  in the motel room   this
Butch rides up on Grace
He hops off and runs inside the motel room, while we stay outside with the bike
(
) Butch,  was so worried
Honey, grab your radio and your purse and let's go
(
) But what about all our bags
Fuck the bags
We'll miss our train if we don't split now
(
) Is everything well
Are we in danger
We're cool
In fact, we're super- cool
But we gots to go
'll wait for you outside
Butch runs out and hops back on the bike
Fabienne exits the motel room with the boom box and a large purse
When she sees Butch on the chopper, she stops dead
Where did you get this motorcycle
(he kick-starts it) It's a chopper, baby, hop on
Fabienne slowly approaches the two-wheel demon
What happened to my Honda
Sorry baby,  crashed the Honda
You're hurt
might've broke my nose, no biggie
Hop on
She doesn't move
Butch looks at her
Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road
Fabienne starts to cry
Butch realizes that this is not the way to get her on the bike
He turns off the engine and reaches out, taking her hand
'm sorry, baby-love
(crying) You were gone so long,  started to think dreadful thoughts
'm sorry  worried you, sweetie
Everything's fine
Hey, how was breakfast
(waterworks drying a little) It was good did you get the blueberry pancakes
No, they didn't have blueberry pancakes,  had to get buttermilk are you sure you're okay
Baby-love, from the moment  left you, this has been without a doubt the single weirdest day of my entire life
Climb on an' 'll tell ya about it
Fabienne does climb on
Butch  her up
Butch, whose motorcycle is this
It's a chopper
Whose chopper is this
Zed's
Who's Zed
Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead
And with that, the two lovebirds   on Grace, as the on the
: "   &  " Over black, we can  in the distance, men talking
(
) You ever read the Bible, Brett
(
) Yes
(
) There's a passage  got memorized, seems appropriate for this situation: Ezekiel 25:17
"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men
" : We're in the bathroom of the Hollywood apartment we were in earlier
In fact, we're there at exactly the same time
Except this time, we're in the bathroom with the
The Fourth Man is pacing around the small room, listening hard to what's being said on the other side of the door, tightly his huge silver
357 Magnum
(
) "
blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherded the weak through the valley of darkness
And  will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers
And you will know  am the Lord when lay my vengeance upon you
" The Fourth Man freaks out
He  himself against the back wall, gun outstretched in front of him, a look of yellow fear on his face, ready to blow in half anybody fool enough to stick their head through that door
Then he listens to them talk
(
) Friend of yours
(
) Yeah, Marvin-Vincent-Vincent-Marvin
Waiting for them isn't the smartest move
Bursting out the door and blowing them all away while they're fuckin' around is the way to go
The bathroom door   and the Fourth Man out, silver Magnum raised,     from his hand cannon
Die
die
die
die
Fourth Man, same as before
He  until he's dry firing
Then a look of confusion crosses his face
Standing next to each other, unharmed
Amazing as it seems, none of the Fourth Man's shots appear to have hit anybody
Jules and Vincent exchange looks like, "Are we hit
" They're as confused at the shooter
After looking at each other, they bring their looks up to the Fourth Man
don't understand The Fourth Man is taken out of the scenario by the two men's bullets who, unlike his,  their marks
He drops
The two men lower their guns
Jules, obviously shaken, sits down in a chair
Vincent, after a moment of respect, shrugs it off
Then heads toward Marvin in the corner
Why the fuck didn't you tell us about that guy in the bathroom
Slip your mind
Forget he was in there with a goddamn hand cannon
(to himself) We should be fuckin' dead right now
(pause) Did you see that gun he fired at us
It was bigger than him
357
We should be fuckin' dead
Yeah, we were lucky
Jules rises, moving toward Vincent
That shit wasn't luck
That shit was somethin' else
Vincent prepares to leave
Yeah, maybe
That was
divine intervention
You know what divine intervention is
Yeah,  think so
That means God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets
Yeah, man, that's what is means
That's exactly what it means
God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets
think we should be going now
Don't do that
Don't you fuckin' do that
Don't blow this shit off
What just happened was a fuckin' miracle
Chill the fuck out, Jules, this shit happens
Wrong, wrong, this shit doesn't just happen
Do you wanna continue this theological discussion in the car, or at the jailhouse with the cops
We should be fuckin' dead now, my friend
We just witnessed a miracle, and  want you to fuckin' acknowledge it
Okay man, it was a miracle, can we leave now
The Chevy Nova  itself into traffic
() Jules is behind the wheel,Vincent in the passenger seat and Marvin in the back
Ever seen that show "
" was watchin' it once and this cop was on it who was talkin' about this time he got into this gun fight with a guy in a hallway
He unloads on this guy and he doesn't hit anything
And these guys were in a hallway
It's a freak, but it happens
If you wanna play blind man, then go walk with a Shepherd
But me, my eyes are wide fuckin' open
What the fuck does that mean
That's it for me
For here on in, you can consider my ass retired
Jesus Christ
Don't blaspheme
Goddammit, Jules said don't do that you're fuckin' freakin' out
'm tellin' Marsellus today 'm through
While you're at it, be sure to tell 'im why
Don't worry,  will
'll bet ya ten thousand dollars, he laughs his ass off
don't give a damn if he does
Vincent turns to the backseat with the
45 casually in his grip
Marvin, what do you make of all this
don't even have an opinion
'mon, Marvin
Do you think God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets
Vincent's
45 goes
Marvin is hit in the upper chest, below the throat
He blood and
What the fuck's happening
just accidentally shot Marvin in the throat
Why the fuck did you do that
didn't mean to do it
said it was an accident
've seen a lot of crazy-ass shit in my time chill out, man, it was an accident, okay
You hit a bump or somethin' and the gun went off
The car didn't hit no motherfuckin' bump
Look
didn't mean to shoot this son-ofa-bitch, the gun just went off, don't ask me how
Look at this mess
We're drivin' around on a city street in broad daylight know,  know,  wasn't thinkin' about the splatter
Well you better be thinkin' about it now, motherfucker
We gotta get this car off the road
Cops tend to notice shit like you're driving a car drenched in fuckin' blood
Can't we just take it to a friendly place
This is the Valley, Vincent
Marsellus don't got no friendly places in the Valley
Well, don't look at me, this is your town, Jules
Jules takes out a cellular phone and starts punching digits
Who ya callin'
buddy of mine in Toluca Lake
Where's Toluca Lake
On the other side of the hill, by Burbank Studios
If Jimmie's ass ain't home,  don't know what the fuck we're gonna go
ain't got any other partners in 818
(into phone) Jimmie
How you doin' man, it's Jules
(pause) Listen up man, me an' my homeboy are in some serious shit
We're in a car we gotta get off the road, pronto need to use your garage for a couple hours
' Jules is bent over a sink, washing his bloody hands while Vincent stands behind him
We gotta be real fuckin' delicate with this Jimmie's situation
He's one remark away from kickin' our asses out the door
If he kicks us out, whadda we do
Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made a couple phone calls
But  never want it to reach that pitch
Jimmie's my friend and you don't bust in your friend's house and start tellin' 'im what's what
Jules rises and dries his hands
Vincent takes his place at the sink
Just tell 'im not to be abusive
He kinda freaked out back there when he saw Marvin
Put yourself in his position
It's eight o'clock in the morning
He just woke up, he wasn't prepared for this shit
Don't forget who's doin' who a favor
Vincent finishes, then dries his hands on a white towel
If the price of that favor is  gotta take shit, he can stick his favor straight up his ass
When Vincent is finished drying his hands, the towel is stained with red
What the fuck did you just do to his towel
was just dryin' my hands
You're supposed to wash 'em first
You watched me wash 'em
watched you get 'em wet
washed 'em
Blood's real hard to get off
Maybe if he had some Lava, coulda done a better job
used the same soap you did and when  dried my hands, the towel didn't look like a fuckin' Maxie pad
Look, fuck it, alright
Who cares
But it's shit like this that's gonna bring this situation to a boil
If he were to come in here and see that towel like that
'm tellin' you Vincent, you best be cool
'Cause if  gotta get in to it with Jimmie on account of you
Look,  ain't threatenin' you,  respect you an' all, just don't put me in that position
Jules, you ask me nice like that, no problem
He's your friend, you handle him
' Three men are standing in Jimmie's kitchen, each with a mug of coffee
Jules, Vincent and  , a young man in his late 20s dressed in a bathrobe
Goddamn Jimmie, this is some serious gourmet shit
Me an' Vincent woulda been satisfied with freeze-dried Tasters Choice
You spring this gourmet fuckin' shit on us
What flavor is this
Knock it off, Julie
What
'm not a cobb or corn, so you can stop butterin' me up
don't need you to tell me how good my coffee is
'm the one who buys it,  know how fuckin' good it is
When Bonnie goes shoppin;, she buys shit
buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause when  drink it,  wanna taste it
But what's on my mind at this moment isn't the coffee in my kitchen, it's the dead nigger in my garage
Jimmie 'm talkin'
Now let me ask you a question, Jules
When you drove in here, did you notice a sign out front that said, "Dead nigger storage
" Jules starts to "Jimmie" him answer to question
Did you see a sign out in front of my house that said, "Dead nigger storage
" (playing along) Naw man,  didn't
You know why you didn't see that sign
Why
'Cause storin' dead niggers ain't my fuckin' business
Jules starts to "Jimmie" him
ain't through
Now don't you understand that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead body in her house, 'm gonna get divorced
No marriage counselor, no trial separation fuckin' divorced
And  don't wanna get fuckin' divorced
The last time me an' Bonnie talked about this shit was gonna be the last time me an' Bonnie talked about this shit
Now wanna help ya out Julie,  really do
But  ain't gonna lose my wife doin' it
Jimmie don't fuckin' Jimmie me, man, can't be Jimmied
There's nothin' you can say that's gonna make me forget  love my wife
Now she's workin' the graveyard shift at the hospital
She'll be comin' home in less than an hour and a half
Make your phone calls, talk to your people, than get the fuck out of my house
That's all we want
We don't wanna fuck up your shit
We just need to call our people to bring us in
Then  suggest you get to it
Phone's in my bedroom
' Marsellus Wallace sits at his dining table in a big comfy robe, eating his large breakfast, while talking on the phone
well, say she comes home
Whaddya think she'll do
(pause) No fuckin' shit she'll freak
That ain't no kinda answer
You know 'er, don't
How bad, a lot or a little
' Jules paces around in Jimmie's bedroom on the phone
You got to appreciate what an explosive element this Bonnie situation is
If she comes home from a hard day's work and finds a bunch of gangsters doin' a bunch of gangsta' shit in her kitchen, ain't no tellin' what she's apt to do
've grasped that, Jules
All 'm doin' is contemplating the "ifs
" don't wanna hear about no motherfuckin' "ifs
"What  wanna hear from your ass is: "you ain't got no problems, Jules
'm on the motherfucker
Go back in there, chill them niggers out and wait for the cavalry, which should be comin' directly
" You ain't got no problems, Jules
'm on the motherfucker
Go back in there, chill them niggers out and wait for The Wolf, who should be comin' directly
You sendin' The Wolf
Feel better
Shit Negro, that's all you had to say
The  looks through the bedroom doorway of a hotel suite into the main area
We  a crap game being played on a fancy crap table by  in tuxedos and   in fancy evening gowns
The   to the right revealing: Sitting on a bed, phone in hand with his back to us, the tuxedo-clad   aka " "
We also see The Wolf has a small notepad that he jots details in
(into phone) Is she the hysterical type
(pause) When she due
(jotting down) Give me the principals' names again
(jots down) Jules
We  his book
The page has written on it: "1265 Riverside Drive Toluca Lake 1 body (no head) Bloody shot-up car Jules (black)" Vincent
Jimmie
Bonnie
: "Vincent (Dean Martin) Jimmie (house) Bonnie (9:30)" Expect a call around 10:30
It's about thirty minutes away
'll be there in ten
He hangs up
We never see his face
: : "   -  " : ' silver Porsche  the corner leading to Jimmie's home, in
Easily doing 135 mph, the Porsche stops on a dime in front of Jimmie's house
ringed finger touches the doorbell:
' Jimmie opens the door
We see, standing in the doorway, the tuxedo-clad man
He looks down to his notebook, then up at Jimmie
You're Jimmie, right
This is your house
Yeah
(stick his hand out) 'm Winston Wolf,  solve problems
Good, 'cause we got one
So  heard
May  come in
Please do
In the dining room, Jules and Vincent stand up
You must be Jules, which would make you Vincent
Let's get down to brass tacks, gentlemen
If  was informed correctly, the clock is ticking, is that right, Jimmie
100%
Your wife, Bonnie
(refers to his pad) comes home at 9:30 in the , is that correct
Uh-huh
was led to believe if she comes home and finds us here, she wouldn't appreciate it none too much
She won't at that
That gives us forty minutes to get the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you do what  say when  say it, should by plenty
Now you got a corpse in a car, minus a head, in a garage
Take me to it
' The three men hang back as The Wolf examines the car
He studies the car in silence, opening the door, looking inside, circling it
Jimmie
Yes
Do me a favor, will ya
Thought smelled some coffee in there
Would you make me a cup
Sure, how do you take it
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar
Jimmie exists
The Wolf continues his examination
About the car, is there anything need to know
Does it stall, does it make a lot of noise, does it smoke, is there gas in it, anything
Aside from how it looks, the car's cool
Positive
Don't get me out on the road and  find out the brake lights don't work
Hey man, as far as  know, the motherfucker's tip-top
Good enough, let's go back to the kitchen
Jimmie hands The Wolf a cup of coffee
Thank you, Jimmie
He takes a sip, then, pacing as he thinks, lays out for the three men the plan of action
Okay first thing, you two
(meaning Jules and Vincent) Take the body, stick it in the trunk
Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty domesticated house
That would lead me to believe that in the garage or under the sink, you got a bunch of cleansers and cleaners and shit like that, am  correct
Yeah
Exactly
Under the sink
Good
What  need you two fellas to do is take those cleaning products and clean the inside of the car
And 'm talkin' fast, fast, fast
You need to go in the backseat, scoop up all those little pieces of brain and skull
Get it out of there
Wipe down the upholstery  now when it comes to upholstery, it don't need to be spic and span, you don't need to eat off it
Give it a good once over
What you need to take care of are the really messy parts
The pools of blood that have collected, you gotta soak that shit up
But the windows are a different story
Them you really clean
Get the Windex, do a good job
Now Jimmie, we need to raid your linen closet
need blankets,  need comforters,  need quilts,  need bedspreads
The thicker the better, the darker the better
No whites, can't use 'em
We need to camouflage the interior of the car
We're gonna line the front seat and the backseat and the floor boards with quilts and blankets
If a cop stops us and starts stickin' his big snout in the car, the subterfuge won't last
But at a glance, the car will appear to be normal
Jimmie lead the way, boys  get to work
The Wolf and Jimmie turn, heading for the bedroom, leaving Vincent and Jules standing in the kitchen
(calling after him) "please" would be nice
The Wolf stops and turns around
Come again
said a "please" would be nice
The Wolf takes a step toward him
Set is straight, Buster
'm not here to say "please
"'m here to tell you want to do
And if self- preservation is an instinct you possess, you better fuckin' do it and do it quick
'm here to help
If my help's not appreciated, lotsa luck gentlemen
It ain't that way, Mr
Wolf
Your help is definitely appreciated
don't mean any disrespect
just don't like people barkin' orders at me
If 'm curt with you, it's because time is a factor
think fast, talk fast, and  need you guys to act fast if you want to get out of this
So pretty please, with sugar on top, clean the fuckin' car
' Jimmie's gathering all the bedspreads, quilts and linen he has
The Wolf is on the phone
(into phone) It's a 1974 Chevy Nova
(pause) White
(pause) Nothin', except for the mess inside
(pause) About twenty minutes
(pause) Nobody who'll be missed
(pause) You're a good man, Joe
See ya soon
(he looks at Jimmie) How we comin', Jimmie
Jimmie comes over with a handful of linen
Mr
Wolf, you gotta understand somethin' Winston, Jimmie  please, Winston
You gotta understand something, Winston
want to help you guys out and all, but that's my best linen
It was a wedding present from my Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, and they ain't with us anymore let me ask you a question, if you don't mind
Sure
Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny millionaires
No
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is
And 'm positive if Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny were millionaires, they would've furnished you with a whole bedroom set, which your Uncle Marsellus is more than happy to do
(takes out a roll of bills) like oak myself, that's what's in my bedroom
How 'bout you Jimmie, you an oak man
Oak's nice
Both Jules and Vincent are inside the car cleaning it up
Vincent is in the front seat washing windows, while Jules is in the backseat, picking up little pieces of skull and gobs of brain
Both are twice as bloody as they were before
will never forgive your ass for this shit
This is some fucked-up repugnant shit
Did you ever hear the philosophy that once a man admits he's wrong, he's immediately forgiven for all wrong-doings
Man, get outta my face with that shit
The motherfucker who said that never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of skull with his fingers on account of your dumb ass
got a threshold, Jules
got a threshold for the abuse 'll take
And you're crossin' it
'm a race car and you got me in the red
Redline 7000, that's where you are
Just know, it's fuckin' dangerous to be drivin' a race car when it's in the red
It could blow
You're gettin' ready to blow
'm a mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker
Every time my fingers touch brain 'm "
," 'm the " " 'm what Jimmie Walker usta talk about
In fact, what the fuck am  doin' in the back
You're the motherfucker should be on brain detail
We're tradin'
'm washin' windows and you're pickin' up this nigger's skull
The interior of the car has been cleaned and lined with bedspreads and quilts
Believe it or not, what looked like a portable slaughterhouse can actually pass for a non-descript vehicle
The Wolf circles the car examining it
Jules and Vincent stand aside, their clothes are literally a bloody mess, but they do have a sense of pride in what a good job they've done
Fine job, gentlemen
We may get out of this yet
can't believe that's the same car
Well, let's not start suckin' each other's dicks quite yet
Phase one is complete, clean the car, which moves us right along to phase two, clean you two
' Jules and Vincent stand side by side in their black suits, covered in blood, in Jimmie's backyard
Jimmie holds a plastic Hefty trash bag, while The Wolf holds a garden hose with one of those guns nozzles attached
Strip
All the way
To your bare ass
As they follow directions, The Wolf enjoys a smoke
Quickly gentlemen, we got about fifteen minutes before Jimmie's better- half comes pulling into the driveway
This morning air is some chilly shit
Are you sure this is absolutely necessary
You know what you two look like
What
Like a couple of guys who just blew off somebody's head
Yes, strippin' off those bloody rags is absolutely necessary
Toss the clothes in Jim's garbage bag
Now Jimmie, don't do nothin' stupid like puttin' that out in front of your house for Elmo the garbage man to take away
Don't worry, we're takin' it with us
Jim, the soap
He hands the now-naked men a bar of soap
Okay gentlemen, you're both been to County before, 'm sure
Here it comes
He hits the trigger, water  ,  both men
Goddamn, that water's fuckin' cold
Better you than me, gentlemen
The two men, trembling, scrub themselves
Don't be afraid of the soap, spread it around
The Wolf stops the hose, tossing it on the ground
Towel 'em
Jimmie tosses them each a towel, which they rub furiously across their bodies
You're dry enough, give 'em their clothes
: In their tee-shirts and swim trunks
They look a million miles away from the black-suited, bad-asses we first met
Perfect
Perfect
We couldn't've planned this better
You guys look like
what do they look like, Jimmie
Dorks
They look like a couple of dorks
The Wolf and Jimmie laugh
Ha ha ha
They're your clothes, motherfucker
guess you just gotta know how to wear them
Yeah, well, our asses ain't the expert on wearin' dorky shit that your is
'mon, gentlemen, we're laughin' and jokin' our way into prison
Don't make me beg
' The garbage bag is tossed in the car trunk on top of Marvin
The Wolf  is closed
Gentlemen, let's get our rules of the road straight
We're going to a place called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow
Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel are sympathetic to out dilemma
The place is North Hollywood, so a few twist and turns aside, we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way
Now 'll drive the tainted car
Jules, you ride with me
Vincent, you follow in my Porsche
Now if we cross the path of any John
Laws, nobody does a fuckin' thing 'til  do something
( ) What did  say
Don't do shit unless unless what
Unless you do it first
Spoken like a true prodigy
(to Vincent) How 'bout you, Lash Larue
Can you keep your spurs from jingling and jangling
'm cool, Mr
Wolf
My gun just went off,  dunno how
Fair enough
(he throws Vince his car keys) drive real fuckin' fast, so keep up
If  get my car back any different than  gave it, Monster Joe's gonna be disposing of two bodies
' Jules and Vincent wait by Winston's Porsche
We cool
Like it never happened
Jules and Vincent bump fists
Boys, this is Raquel
Someday, all this will be hers
(to the boys) Hi
You know, if they ever do " :   ," you guys, 'd be great
What's with the outfits
You guys going to a volleyball game
Winston laughs, the boys groan
'm takin' m'lady out to breakfast
Maybe  can drop you two off
Where do you live
Redondo Beach
Inglewood
Winston grabs Jules' wrist and pantomimes like he's in a " " trance
(painfully) It's your future:  see
a cab ride
(dropping the act) Sorry guys, move out of the sticks
(to Raquel) Say goodbye, Raquel
Goodbye, Raquel
'll see you two around, and stay outta trouble, you crazy kids
Winston turns to leave
Mr
Wolf
He turns around
was a pleasure watchin' you work
The Wolf smiles
Call me Winston
He turns and banters with Raquel as they get in the Porsche
You hear that, young lady
Respect
You could lean a lot from those two fine specimens
Respect for one's elders shows character
have character
Just because you are a character doesn't mean you have character
Oh you're so funny, oh you're so funny
The Porsche   down the road
The two men left alone look at each other
Wanna share a cab
You know  could go for some breakfast
Want to have breakfast with me
Sure
Jules and Vincent sit at a booth
In front of Vincent is a big stack of pancakes and sausages, which he eats with gusto
Jules, on the other hand, just has a cup of coffee and a muffin
He seems far away in thought
The Waitress pours a refill for both men, Thanks a bunch
(to Jules, who's nursing his coffee) Want a sausage
Naw,  don't eat pork
Are you Jewish
ain't Jewish man,  just don't dig on swine
Why not
They're filthy animals
don't eat filthy animals
Sausages taste good
Pork chops taste good
sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie
'll never know 'cause even if it did,  wouldn't eat the filthy motherfucker
Pigs sleep and root in shit
That's a filthy animal
don't wanna eat nothin' that ain't got enough sense to disregard its own feces
How about dogs
Dogs eat their own feces
don't eat dog either
Yes, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal
wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy, but they're definitely dirty
But a dog's got personality
And personality goes a long way
So by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he's cease to be a filthy animal
We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one motherfuckin' charmin' pig
It'd have to be the Cary Grant of pigs
The two men laugh
Good for you
Lighten up a little
You been sittin' there all quiet
just been sittin' here thinkin'
(mouthful of food) About what
The miracle we witnessed
The miracle you witnessed
witnessed a freak occurrence
Do you know that a miracle is
An act of God
What's an act of God
guess it's when God makes the impossible possible
And 'm sorry Jules, but  don't think what happened this morning qualifies
Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't matter
You're judging this thing the wrong way
It's not about what
It could be God stopped the bullets, he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found my fuckin' car keys
You don't judge shit like this based on merit
Whether or not what we experienced was an according-to-Hoyle miracle is insignificant
What is significant is  felt God's touch, God got involved
But why
That's what's fuckin' wit' me don't know why
But  can't go back to sleep
So you're serious, you're really gonna quit
The life, most definitely
Vincent takes a bite of food
Jules takes a sip of coffee In the b
g
, we see a  call the Waitress
Garcon
Coffee
We recognize the patron to be Pumpkin from the first scene of Pumpkin and Honey Bunny
So if you're quitting the life, what'll you do
That's what 've been sitting here contemplating
First, 'm gonna deliver this case to Marsellus
Then, basically, 'm gonna walk the earth
What do you mean, walk the earth
You know, like Caine in "
" Just walk from town to town, meet people, get in adventures
How long do you intend to walk the earth
Until God puts me where he want me to be
What if he never does
If it takes forever, 'll wait forever
So you decided to be a bum
'll just be Jules, Vincent  no more, no less
No Jules, you're gonna be like those pieces of shit out there who beg for change
They walk around like a bunch of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in garbage bins, they eat what  throw away, and dogs piss on 'em
They got a word for 'em, they're called bums
And without a job, residence, or legal tender, that's what you're gonna be  a fuckin' bum
Look my friend, this is just where me and you differ what happened was peculiar  no doubt about it  but it wasn't water into wine
All shapes and sizes, Vince
Stop fuckin' talkin' like that
If you find my answers frightening, Vincent, you should cease askin' scary questions
gotta take a shit
To be continued
Vincent exits for the restroom
Jules, alone, takes a mouthful of muffin, then
Pumpkin and Honey Bunny rise with guns raised
Everybody be cool, this is a robbery
Any of you fuckin' pricks move and 'll execute every one of you motherfuckers
Got that
Jules looks up, not believing what he's seeing
Under the table, Jules' hand goes to his
45 Automatic
He pulls it out,
Customers stay seated, waitresses on the floor
Now mean fuckin' now
Do it or die, do it or fucking die
Like lightning, Pumpkin moves over to the kitchen
While Honey Bunny  out threats to the , keeping them terrified
You Mexicans in the kitchen, get out here
Asta luego
Three  and two  come out of the kitchen
On the floor or 'll cook you ass, comprende
They comprende
The portly  speaks up
'm the manager here, there's no problem, no problem at all Pumpkin heads his way
You're gonna give me a problem
He reaches him and sticks the barrel of his gun hard in the Manager's neck
What
You said you're gonna give me a problem
No, 'm not
'm not gonna give you any problem
don't know, Honey Bunny
He looks like the hero type to me
Don't take any chances
Execute him
The Patrons
Jules watches all this silently, his hand tightly gripping the
45 Automatic under the table
Please don't
'm not a hero
'm just a coffee shop manager
Take anything you want
Tell everyone to cooperate and it'll be all over
Everybody just be calm and cooperate with them and this will be all over soon
Well done, now git your fuckin' ass on the ground
Vincent, on the toilet, oblivious to the pandemonium outside, reads his " " book
Cash register drawer opens
Pumpkin stuffs the money from the till in his pocket
Then walks from behind the counter with a trash bag in his hand
Okay people, 'm going to go 'round and collect your wallets
Don't talk, just toss 'em in the bag
We clear
Pumpkin goes around collecting wallets
Jules sits with his 45 ready to spit under the table
Pumpkin sees Jules sitting in his booth, holding his wallet, briefcase next to him
Pumpkin crosses to him, his tone more respectful, him manner more on guard
In the bag
Jules  his wallet in the bag
Using his gun as a pointer, Pumpkin points to the briefcase
What's in that
My boss' dirty laundry
You boss makes you do his laundry
When he wants it clean
Sounds like a shit job
Funny, 've been thinkin' the same thing
Open it up
Jules' free hand lays palm flat on the briefcase
'Fraid  can't do that
Pumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer
He aims the gun right in the middle of Jules' face and pulls back the hammer
didn't hear you
Yes, you did
This exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard it, but Honey Bunny senses something's wrong
What's goin' on
Looks like we got a vigilante in our midst
Shoot 'em in the face
don't mean to shatter your ego, but this ain't the first time 've had gun pointed at me
You don't open up that case, it's gonna be the last
(on the ground) Quit causing problems, you'll get us all killed
Give 'em what you got and get 'em out of here
Keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat man, this ain't any of your goddamn business
'm countin' to three, and if your hand ain't off that case, 'm gonna unload right in your fuckin' face
Clear
One
two
three
You win
Jules raises his hand off the briefcase
It's all yours, Ringo
Open it
Jules flips the locks and opens the case, revealing it to Pumpkin but not to us
The same light  from the case
Pumpkin's expression goes to amazement
Honey Bunny, across the room, can't see shit
What is it
What is it
(softly) Is that what  think it is
Jules nods his head: "yes
" It's beautiful
Jules nods his head: "yes
" Goddammit, what is it
Jules  the case closed, then sits back, as if offering the case to Pumpkin
Pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to pick up the case
Like a rattlesnake, Jules' free hand  the wrist of Pumpkin's gun hand,  it on the table
His other hand comes from under the table and  the barrel of his
45 hand under Pumpkin's chin
Honey Bunny freaks out, waving her gun in Jules' direction
Let him go
Let him go
'll blow your fuckin' head off
'll kill ya
'll kill ya
You're gonna die, you're gonna fuckin' die bad
(to Pumpkin) Tell that bitch to be cool
Say, bitch be cool
Say, bitch be cool
Chill out, honey
Let him go
(softly) Tell her it's gonna be okay
'm gonna be okay
Promise her
promise
Tell her to chill
Just chill out
What's her name
Yolanda
Whenever Jules talks to Yolanda, he never looks at her, only at Pumpkin
(to Yolanda) So, we cool Yolanda
We ain't gonna do anything stupid, are we
(crying) Don't you hurt him
Nobody's gonna hurt anybody
We're gonna be like three Fonzies
And what' Fonzie like
No answer
'mon Yolanda, what's Fonzie like
(through tears, unsure) He's cool
Correct-amundo
And that's what we're gonna be, we're gonna be cool
(to Pumpkin) Now Ringo, 'm gonna count to three and  want you to let go your gun and lay your palms flat on the table
But when you do it, do it cool
Ready
Pumpkin looks at him
One
two
three
Pumpkin lets go of his gun and places both hands on the table
Yolanda can't stand it anymore
Okay, now let him go
Yolanda,  thought you were gonna be cool
When you yell at me, it makes me nervous
When  get nervous, get scared
And when motherfuckers get scared, that's when motherfuckers get accidentally shot
(more conversational) Just know: you hurt him, you die
That seems to be the situation
Now don't want that and you don't want that and Ringo here don't want that
So let's see what we can do
(to Ringo) Now this is the situation
Normally both of your asses would be dead as fuckin' fried chicken
But you happened to pull this shit while 'm in a transitional period
don't wanna kill ya,  want to help ya
But 'm afraid  can't give you the case
It don't belong to me
Besides, went through too much shit this morning on account of this case to just hand it over to your ass
(
) What the fuck's goin' on here
Yolanda  her gun toward the stranger
Vincent, by the bathroom, has his gun out, dead-aimed at Yolanda
It's cool, Vincent
It's cool
Don't do a goddamn thing
Yolanda, it's cool baby, nothin's changed
We're still just talkin'
(to Pumpkin) Tell her we're still cool
It's cool, Honey Bunny, we're still cool
(gun raised) What the hell's goin' on, Jules
Nothin'  can't handle
want you to just hang back and don't do shit unless it's absolutely necessary
Check
Yolanda, how we doin, baby
gotta go pee
want to go home
Just hang in there, baby, you're doing' great, Ringo's proud of you and so am
It's almost over
(to Pumpkin) Now  want you to go in that bag and find my wallet
Which one is it
It's the one that says Bad Motherfucker on it
Pumpkin looks in the bag and  sure enough  there's a wallet with "Bad Motherfucker" embroidered on it
That's my bad motherfucker
Now open it up and take out the cash
How much is there
About fifteen hundred dollars
Put it in your pocket, it's yours
Now with the rest of them wallets and the register, that makes this a pretty successful little score
Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen hundred buck, 'm gonna shoot 'em on general principle
You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing, now hang back and shut the fuck up
Besides,  ain't givin' it to him
'm buyin' somethin' for my money
Wanna know what 'm buyin' Ringo
What
Your life
'm givin' you that money so  don't hafta kill your ass
You read the Bible
Not regularly
There's a passage  got memorized
Ezekiel 25:17
"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men
Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness
For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children
And will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers
And you will know  am the Lord when  lay my vengeance upon you
"  been sayin' that shit for years
And if you ever heard it, it meant your ass
never really questioned what it meant
thought it was just a coldblooded thing to say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped a cap in his ass
But  saw some shit this mornin' made me think twice
Now 'm thinkin', it could mean you're the evil man
And 'm the righteous man
And Mr
45 here, he's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness
Or is could by you're the righteous man and 'm the shepherd and it's the world that's evil and selfish
'd like that
But that shit ain't the truth
The truth is you're the weak
And 'm the tyranny of evil men
But 'm tryin'
'm tryin' real hard to be a shepherd
Jules lowers his gun, lying it on the table
Pumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to Yolanda
She looks back
Grabbing the trash bag full of wallets, the two  out the door
Jules, who was never risen from his seat the whole time, takes a sip of coffee
(to himself) It's cold
He pushes it aside
Vincent appears next to Jules
think we oughta leave now
That's probably a good idea
Vincent throws some money on the table and Jules grabs the briefcase
Then, to the amazement of the Patrons, the Waitresses, the Cooks, the Bus Boys, and the Manager, these two bad-ass dudes wearing  Santa Cruz and "'m with Stupid" tee-shirts, swim trunks, thongs and packing
45 Automatics  walk out of the coffee shop together without saying a word
