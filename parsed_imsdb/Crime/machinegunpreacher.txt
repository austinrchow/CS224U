Written by Jason Keller based on the life of Sam Childers 9/30/2010 This is true
-  - (2003) The night is stillborn
Without sound or movement and nothing is in definition
All we see are degrees of blackness in this unlit world
The vague impressions of an African village in the void
a ragged line of tukuls (straw huts)
a bicycle propped against a mud wall
a soccer ball in the dirt
- And we find a Sudanese family asleep on reed mats
mother, father and their two boys
The younger boy we'll come to know as "" (9)
His older brother "" (12) curled next to him
- And slowly the blackness begins to shift
an otherworldly light seeping in from someplace far off
shadows contorting in a ghostly orange flicker
images emerging
the silhouettes of men coming into this village carrying flaming torches
- The family still sound asleep, oblivious to the torch glow coming from outside, and suddenly -- --
The family bolts awake, moving to their feet as the door to their tukul  open --  soldiers from the Lord's Resistance Army () coming in carrying AK47's -- shouting in Arabic -- "Get up
Get up
" -- the  stepping forward -- holding up his hands -- "Don't shoot
" -- And he's gunned down in cold blood
The soldiers grab the mother and boys and begin to drag them out of the tukul -- but  breaks free -- scrambles deeper into the room -- going after him --  darting behind a stack of storage boxes knocking them to the ground -- frantically burrowing into the corner -- trying to get away but it's useless -- grabs his feet and begins to pull him out -- -- digging his nails into the dirt -- and as he's dragged out of the corner he reaches out
inadvertently grabs a which has fallen on the ground
- --
-- the black sky ablaze in apocalyptic fire -- families yanked out of their burning tukuls by  rebels -- the adult males of this village shot dead or bludgeoned to death -- the women and children forced into the center of the village -- huddled together and weeping -- -- and now we see  hauled out -- his captor shouting to another soldier -- pointing to ' mother and she's pulled from the group and forced onto her knees
and  is brought in front of her -- his captor saying something in Arabic as he hands him a club -- "Kill her
" -- shaking his head `no' -- tossing the club in the dirt and -- --  is hit with the butt of a rifle -- goes down -- blood streaming down his face as he's pulled back up to his feet -- crying -- shaking with fear
and then he sees his mother staring up at him
and despite the hell unfolding around them we see a moment here between mother and son
something calm and reassuring in the way she's looking at him now
her eyes full of love
and pity
for her child in this terrible moment
and before we see how this ends we -- : -- -- , , -   -  - (/1998) And we see   coming down a corridor toward us, dressed in jailhouse orange and flanked by a guard
He's stocky, 32 years old, with a biker's handlebar moustache
On the surface he appears good- looking
even handsome if the light is right
but his face is tricky
always changing
behind the quick smile, around his dark eyes, in the taut muscles of his neck we see violence
- We see a  handing Sam a prison issue tub full of his personal affects
He takes out his clothes, digs out a leather wallet, a watch, some silver rings and a lighter
He looks up to the Clerk and flashes a malicious smile -- Ya'll go fuck yourself now, k
- beat-up   parked at the curb
Sam's wife, , 30's, in a thrift store dress, leaning against the car, waiting
Sam (dressed in civilian clothes now) pushes out a door and she sees him, straightens her hair, an uneasy smile
Hey baby
/
'  - The Vega pulled of the side of the road and Sam fucking Lynn in the back
There's nothing tender about what we're watching here
Sam finishes and Lynn slumps into the seat, pulls down her dress
Gimme a smoke
Don't got any
What, you quit
( ) Shit, that ain't gonna last
- The Vega pulls up to a beat-to-shit single-wide and Sam and Lynn get out
We see a homemade sign hanging outside the trailer that reads, "Welcome Home Daddy
" And now Sam's daughter  (6) bursts out of the trailer and down the steps
Followed by Sam's mother, , mid 60's, comes out of the trailer
And she jumps into his arms
Hey bug
You see yer sign
Grandma and me made it this mornin
Yep, real nice
Lynn enters the trailer, Paige follows
(') How'ya doin, Mom
Welcome home, Sam
- ( ) You excited, get some juice, help me set the table
Sam and Daisy enter
There's a quiet anxiety to this homecoming
Everybody on edge, careful
(') Hope you're staying for supper
Well,  didn't know if
( ) What time you gotta work
Lynn hesitating, not sure how to answer
not sure what's going to happen when she does
finally
ain't on tonight
What
(changing the subject) You know we could boil up that corn we got in there
Friday night you ain't on
Hell is that
He walks toward the fridge
Paige, get that chair
That cocksucker Mark better be givin you yer time or 'm gonna go over there and bust in his teeth
Why ain't there no beer
ain't dancin no more, Sam
He turns to her, studies her with cold eyes
(') Quit a couple weeks ago
Got a job over at Freemont
You tellin me the truth or is this a joke
Pick up a second shift now and then
Weekends if  want em
It's good money
Good money
You stupid, woman
You quit strippin to pack fucking mushrooms at Freemont
Sam
Mom, keep yer mouth shut
Sam's face changing, starting to turn bad
look we'll come to know
They're good to me over there, Sam
They got daycare for Paige and  can get medical at the end of the year
Tell you what you're gonna do, you're goin back to The Bunny Hop and askin that cocksucker for yer old slot back
( ) You ok
Let's ride our bikes outside
No, Sam
Fuck you ain't
You gonna get that ass back up there and make yer tips
It ain't right
Fuck you talkin about
Daisy scooping up Paige and exiting, screen door slamming behind them and now Sam and Lynn are all alone
ain't dancin cause it ain't right in God's eyes
He don't want me doin that no more
() You found god now, huh
That what this is
He found me, and he's there for you too, baby
Don't gimme that bullshit
You a junkie stripper
Not no more
God helped me change while you was away
Lynn reaches for him but he shoves her back violently
Gitcha hands off me
Sam exits
( ) You can't keep goin the way you goin, baby
- Sam straddles the bike and kicks it to life
He  , kicking up gravel as he blasts past Paige and Daisy
- Sam riding down the road
- tough biker bar in Johnstown,
jukebox in the corner playing Lynard Skynard
Sam coming through the door, - greetings from some of the other bikers here
He makes his way to a back table where a hulking biker in a leather vest named  is sitting with two girls
Donnie looks up, sees Sam
Crazyhorse
There he is
They embrace, old friends
(') Figured you'd be rollin out round now
How you doin, buddy
'm doin
(to one of the girls) Get us a coupla shots and buds
( ) Don't look too worse for the wear
'm alright
Heard yer old lady ain't at the Bunny Hop no more
Bitch found Jesus
Damn
That bearded sonuvagun slipped her the high holy dick while you was in the can, huh
Better him than the milk man, guess
Ain't so sure bout that
Donnie laughs, slaps him on the shoulder
You wanna taste
Sam smiles that wicked smile and we go -- -    - -- as a biker chick leads Sam down this hallway into -- -    - Sam and the biker chick crammed into this dirty stall, Skynard pounding through the walls
He rolls up his shirt sleeve as she cooks a spoon of methamphetamine
juices a hypodermic
he finds a vein and she spikes his arm
presses the plunger and his head rolls back on his shoulders
speed slamming into his bloodstream as we
-  -   - (/1998) Snow piled up on the windowsills and it's cold as shit outside
Sam passed out on the couch and this guy looks like hell
Thinner than the last time we saw him, skin sallow and drawn tight over his face
He stirs awake, sees Paige playing by herself on the floor next to him
She sees that he's awake, picks up her doll, and quietly goes outside without saying a word
-    - Sam coming in, taking a piss, staring at himself in the mirror and we see a junkie map of track marks running up and down his arms
And then   a Pentecostal communion hymn, "the Old Rugged Cross", coming through
taking us to
- ,
- congregation packed into this church for Sunday service
We see Lynn and Paige in the crowd, singing along with the congregation
/
'  - Sam and Donnie in this car, parked in front of broken down clapboard houses
Donnie pointing through the windshield
Right there
With the green light
-   - Bone chill cold
Sam and Donnie on this porch, scarves pulled around their necks, hands shoved into their jackets trying to stay warm
Donnie  at the door
Hey, man, you there
Open up
Donnie  again and the door cracks an inch
and we see a black man with a   on the other side looking out
Fuck are you
It's me, man, c'mon
Fuckin cold out here
don't know you
Yeah you do, man
saw you the other day
'm Bobby's friend
Who the fuck is Bobby
Suddenly Sam pulls a short barrel shotgun from his jacket -- 10  -- presses it to the door and -- - -- concussion like a fucking pipe bomb -- wood splintering through the room like shrapnel -- Sam and Donnie Don't fuckin move
--  hopping off the couch, scattering like rats deeper into the house --   darting out of the room -- Sam leveling the  in his direction -- -- the room flashing like a fucking supernova
-   - scrambling up these stairs -- Sam coming up after him -- hunting him --   in his direction --
-- -   - sprinting down this hallway -- Sam tracking him in the b
g
-- bloodlust in his eyes -- leveling the  and -- --
Shotgun slugs ripping through the house like cannon shot -- bolting through the smoke -- crashing through a door into -- -   - --   bombing in -- hitting the ground -- trying to get to his feet but it's too late because -- --  kicks open the door behind him --   going onto his back, trying to crab crawl away from him but there's nowhere to go -- Sam moving closer -- ,  -- ' -- --   working his way into a corner -- holding his hands in front of his face -- terrified, shaking -- (') --
-- 10 (
) Donnie coming into the room -- '     ,
-- -- Tell me where the shit is or 'll blow yer nigger brains all over this floor
(indicating a closet) In there
Sam  him toward the closet -- Hurry the fuck up
crawling to a small safe in a closet, spins the combo, opens it and pulls out six ounces of uncut cocaine
Cash
grabs a stack of hundreds, hands it to Sam and -- -- he  the butt of the Mossberg into  ' face and he hits the ground on his back -- Sam standing over him -- shoves the barrel of the shotgun into his mouth -- 'mon, let's go
But Sam's not moving
just staring down at
and we're watching something here
a terrible intelligence taking over
something bloodless and inhuman coming over Sam in this moment
and he chambers a slug into the shotgun
(') Fuck are you doin
And this is it
He's going to blow this guys brains all over the floor
(') Sam
His finger curls around the trigger, eyes becoming lethal
(') Sam
And he snaps back, looks around, sees Donnie standing there
11 (') We need to get the fuck outta here
/
'  -  - --
-- Sam and Donnie pumped and celebrating after the robbery
Sam in the passenger seat, already cooking coke in a bent spoon
See that nigger's face when  put it in his mouth
Cook that shit up, man
wanna hit when 'm going a hundred miles an hour in this thing
Sam juices a needle and spikes Donnie's arm
Donnie feeling the rush
pressing on the gas and howling like a wild man
both of them wired out of their heads
down this dark, country road
and then they see
Up the road, standing in this bitter cold with his thumb out
Look at this sorry fucker
- Donnie's car pulls off the road and the Hitchhiker hustles up to it
'  - The Hitchhiker climbing into the backseat
He's late 40's, a drifter, probably American Indian
Donnie starts driving
Cold enough for ya out there, boy
Yeah
Where you goin, man
Dunshore
That's up there past Muncy, right
Yeah
12 We can take you far as McClure
Take me to Dunshore
Sam looking back -- We ain't goin to Dunshore, boy
Said we can drop you at McClure
Suddenly -- silver flashing --   -- out of nowhere -- pressed into Donnie's neck from the backseat -- the Drifter pulling him tight against the seat rest, pressing it into his throat -- What the fuck
Keep drivin
Dunshore or 'll cut his fuckin throat
Get that fuckin blade off him
Sam reaches his leg over and      -- the car forward -- accelerating -- Sam
But Sam's not letting up
pressing down on the peddle hard
90
100
110 mph -- Donnie  -- trying to keep the car on the road --   -- like some wild ride to hell and then -- -- wrestling with the drifter -- fighting wild -- elbowing him in the face and somehow the blade is in his hand now -- and -- Stick, stick, stick, stick, stick, stick
He stabs him six times in the gut
The drifter  in pain
- Donnie's car skidding off the shoulder of the road, back door popping open and the Drifter's body dumped into the dirt
The car , accelerates, tail lights disappearing into the dark
13 -    - Lynn sound asleep in bed
And she slowly stirs awake, hears water running from somewhere in the trailer
-    - Lynn moving down the hall
toward a sliver of light coming from under the closed bathroom door
gently pushing it open to see -- Sam standing at the sink
covered in blood
frantically trying to clean himself up
trying to wash the sin from his skin and clothes but it's useless
and the sense we get is that we're staring at a man at the edge of an abyss
set to swallow him whole
terrified
shaking
and now he realizes Lynn is here and he turns to her
holding up his stained hands
a terrible fear in his eyes when he says
Help me
- Days later and we see Lynn and Paige, dressed up, sitting in the idling car, waiting
He comin or ain't he
don't know
-    - And we find Sam in this bedroom all alone, wearing a thrift store sportcoat, sitting on the edge of the bed
Frozen
Staring at his stocking feet and three or four pairs of workboots scattered on the floor
Lynn steps into the doorway
(
) Honey
You ready
Sam turns to her, and he looks lost here
Like a little boy
don't got no good shoes, Lynn
And she comes into the room, sits on the bed next to him, puts an arm around his shoulder
He don't care what kinda shoes you wearin, baby
14 - ,
- Packed with Sunday families listening to Pastor Krause at the pulpit
Behind him we see a   filled with water
And now we see Sam, Lynn, Paige, and Daisy sitting near the back
Sam looks uncomfortable, on edge
The point of receiving God's word is life
Life upon life
And to accept the blood of Jesus is life upon life upon life
Praise be to God
He breathes his spirit into darkness and makes something good
He sees our shadow and says, `let there be light
" Amen
now proclaim his saving grace
If there are sinners here looking for God raise your hands
few hands shoot up -- (') Stand up
Receive Jesus Christ as your light and saviour
Three or four people moving to their feet, making their way up to the altar
Lynn turns to Sam, their eyes meet
He looks hesitant, unsure
She gives him a reserved little smile, nods her head slightly as if saying "you can do this"
And in her look he finds strength, gets up, slowly makes his way to
And now we see Sam on his knees in the baptismal tank
The water almost up to his waist
Pastor Krause kneeling behind him
(') Receive Jesus as your Lord and Saviour
in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost
and he leans Sam back, cradling his head as he submerges him in the water completely
and when Sam comes back up the church breaks into
and we see Lynn
tears in her eyes
15 clapping in the back row
and an organist and singer begin to sing "Amazing Grace" taking us to
-  - (/1999) Months later and the snow has thawed
it's summer
and we see Sam with other   finishing their day, packing up their tools, cleaning up
We notice that his gaunt cheeks have filled out and he looks healthier
And now a  comes up to Sam, hands him a check
Thanks for your help, Sam
You need me to stay on,  can
We're movin inside next week
can drywall, tile, whatever you got
Know my way round some electrical too
Sorry, Sam,  gotta cut the crew
Just ain't enough work
-    - Sam alone on these steps, lost in thought
Screen door opens and Lynn comes out, sits next to him
She asleep
Think so, in our bed
she's funny
Job's done
thought that was goin through August
Sam shakes his head, and they're quiet
both of them sitting here on these steps
the burden of this life catching up to them in this moment
16 - stares down at her desk with a frown, shaking her head
Sam sitting in a small chair in front of her
got somethin in Pitt, but you gotta have some college for that
'm a hard worker and  learn real fast
But you got no education, Mr
Childers
- And we see Sam standing next to his Harley, talking to a
don't deal bikes
Probably have a better shot if you take it over to Pitt
Or maybe down to Philly
gotta sell it today
Give you four hundred for it
There's almost two grand on this bike
Them pipes right there is custom
You wont see pipes like that on anything round here
Like  said, don't deal bikes
'll give you four-twenty
Cash
Best  can do
'  - '   - Sam on the edge of Paige's bed reading her a '
() "Into the street the Piper stept, smiling first a little smile, then three shrill notes the pipe uttered like a great and mighty army muttered
" What's uttered
Like spoke up, made a sound
17 Okay, keep goin
(turns the page) And out of the houses the rats came tumblin, black rats, brown rats, brother rats, sister rats, and husband rats followed their little rat wives
Til they came to the ragin water where they drowned and lost their lives
" They got rid all them rats
Yep
How come you sold yer Harley
Cause it's what  had to do
Off her look
(') We're gonna be ok, bug, don't you worry
Paige curls into him closer, and we're watching him here
in this moment
holding his daughter
not so sure they're gonna be ok
/
'  - Sam, behind the wheel of the car, parked, staring out the front windshield
to see he's in the parking lot of the bar, just watching the entrance
- Empty except for a handful of regulars
Sam coming through the door, taking in the place, the fucking grime and despair
Moving to Donnie who is sitting in his same spot
Well, well, well, wondered when  was gonna see you again, ole buddy
How you doin
Sam sits
'm doin
Heard you was followin the Lord now
18 Lil' bit
Donnie sizes him up, "how much is a little bit
", turns to the Jackie, gimme a mash and bud
( ) You want somethin
Sam shakes his head
(') You know that old Indian didn't die out there that night
Story in the Lehigh Valley News bout it
Somebody picked that poor bastard up after us, took him to the emergency room, you believe that shit
God was lookin out for us both, suppose
slides a shot and beer in front of Donnie
Well then, here's to him
() Didn't hear you pull up
Got Lynn's car
She broke down on ya
Sold her
Ahhh, shit, man
Shoulda come to yer ole buddy first
Donnie smiling, inviting him back into this world
And we're watching Sam, threshold moment here, considering
- It's late and we see Lynn sitting at the kitchen table alone
Sam has not come home and she is clearly worried
And then we hear a car pulling up outside, door opening and closing, and Sam coming into the trailer
Sorry 'm late
19 Lynn staring at him, trying to read this man's face but he's not looking at her
Avoiding her gaze
Did he use
Is he high
And then she sees a     on his shirtsleeve
Her face contorting almost imperceptibly
Her worst fear realized
Relapse
And she moves to him without saying a word
lifts up his arm and unbuttons the cuff of his shirt
slowly pushing up his shirtsleeve to discover a   in his arm
and then he pulls out a $20 bill and hands it to her
(') Gave blood over in Pitt
Lynn searching his eyes and she knows he's telling the truth
(') That's all  got
And she pulls him close, hugging him tight, grateful
Somethin will come through
promise
And we hold on Sam, his troubled eyes
Completely out of options
And we see that for this man the inability to provide for his family is crushing
- --
-- a storm starting to batter the trailer park
- Lynn in front of the , scared, watching an winds buffeting the trailer
Sam coming into the room from the back
Two touched down near Harrisberg
- Sam opening the door, coming down the steps, looking up to the sky and it is fucking black, swirling, ominous
- Sam coming back into the trailer fast -- Come on
Let's go
Lynn following him -- 20 -    - -- down the hallway --    -- starting to rock the trailer back and forth
Get Paige, grab a blanket
-- Lynn darting into a bedroom, scooping Paige out of her bed
-   - Sam coming in, moving to a metal gun locker in the corner of the room, pulling out a
-   - --  the trailer now -- Lynn and Paige -- terrified - - watching as Sam moves to the center of the room, points the barrel of the shotgun toward the floor and -- Blows four gaping holes in the floorboards, then starts to kick through the wood with his boot -- (yelling, over the wind) What are you doing
He kicks a hole in the planks, turns to Lynn and Paige -- Paige crawling through the opening
into a shallow trench underneath the trailer
Lynn squeezing in behind her
Sam staying outside
no room for him
the trailer starting to buck in the tempest
thin walls contorting around him
and Paige starts to cry -- terrified -- Sam laying down on the floor next to the opening, close enough so she can hear his voice
(') Bug, you hear me
-- Bug
Yeah
And he starts to play a child's word association game with her
something she knows
something they've played before
'm thinkin of a snail
you hear me, Bug
Snail
21 And we hear her tiny little voice say
Whale
Good job, Bug, good job
You said whale, 'm thinkin of a pail
You said pail, 'm thinkin of a tail
And so this little game goes between father and daughter
Paige listening to his voice
in the midst of this terrible storm
somehow becoming less terrified
- brilliantly clear day and we see neighbors picking up after the storm
Sam on a ladder leaning against the trailer, nailing down a strip of bent aluminum as a pickup truck pulls up
Window rolls down and we see it's the  from before
Sam
Billy
Tried to ring ya but your phones down
Yep
Sam climbs down, moves to the truck, shakes his hand
Looks like ya made it through pretty good
We're alright
Damn twister touched down eight places between here and Noblesville
Chewed up six hundred homes in Fulton County alone
() Got all the work you can handle if you're interested
'm interested
Sam, seizing an opportunity here
22 (') But 'm puttin my own crew together
We go 50/50 on the jobs
You cover any heavy machines  need
60/40 til you pay me back on the tools
Then we'll go half
You got a deal
: - of Lynn carefully applying a vinyl application on the side of a new (but used) truck that reads, "Childers Construction Company" : '  -  - (/2000) lynn's closed eyes -- smiling -- What are you doin, Sam Childers
Months later and we're with Lynn and Paige, their eyes shut, as Sam leads them both by the hand
wanna peek
Keep em closed
Sam finally stops them
(') Ok
Open em up
They do and both of their eyes go wide with surprise
Where are we
We're home, little girl
to see a modest two bedroom house at the end of this driveway
Their new home
That's ours
23 Sure is
Go check it out
Paige sprints for the house as Lynn hugs Sam, softly starts to cry into his shoulder
It's beautiful
- The first night in their new home and we see a few unpacked moving boxes here
'  -   - Paige sound asleep on a small bed upstairs
- '  - Lynn in the kitchen organizing the cabinets
And Sam enters carrying a box, sets it on the counter
That's everything
You get what's in the trunk
Yep
Lynn looking up, seeing how dirty Sam is from the move
Lord, you're filthy, Sam Childers
Lynn tossing him a kitchen towel
Sam, smiling mischievously
Who you callin filthy, woman
You
You dirtier than  am
No  ain't
Yes you are
seen it
'mon, girl, gimme a little shake
24 Sam winking at her and playfully snapping a kitchen towel at her butt
Lynn giggling and scooting away
ain't doin that no more
just a little somethin for yer old man, c'mon
And he snaps her butt again but she grabs the towel and snaps him back
(') Owww
You gimme a little shake
She snaps him again and he feels the sting
'mon, Lynn
She snaps him again but he grabs her and they fall into each other against the counter
laughing
and he kisses her
playful at first and then it becomes more passionate
and just as it starts to lead somewhere we go
-  - (/2002) Two years later and we're watching a congregation finish a Sunday hymn
Sam, Lynn, Daisy, and Paige (10) in the crowd listening to Pastor Krause
Today we are blessed with a special guest
It's my pleasure to welcome Pastor Relling from the Kilangire Christian Ministry in Uganda, Africa
Pastor
Polite applause as a tall, white South African man named steps up to the pulpit, and in a deep Afrikaner accent he -- Thank you Pastor Krause, and thank you brothers and sisters for inviting me into this house of the Lord
() 'm here today to talk to you about your Christian brothers and sisters, families just like yours, a half a world away that desperately need your help
And we see Sam in this sea of faces, listening
25 -  - Parishioners slowly filing out of the church after service
Lynn, Paige, and a few other women chatting by the entrance
And now Lynn looks over her shoulder and sees Sam talking with Paul Relling off to the side, just the two of them in a corner, deep in discussion
- The first thing we notice is the relative "opulence" of this place
deep shag, new color , matching sectional sofa
the rural idea of making it
Sam, Lynn, Daisy and Paige at the dinner table eating
Sam in his own world, oblivious to the until -- Paige, go get some more beans
Paige heads to the kitchen
(') What are you thinking
Thinking about Africa
Paige comes back in carrying the beans
They have tigers over there
() They eat people
What about Africa
Just thinkin bout that fella today
He talked funny
Just from a different place than us, baby, that's all
Was thinkin maybe 'd go over there
Help em out fer a few weeks
26 Africa
To see the tigers
He was talkin about puttin box beam roofs on school houses over there
What about finishing that job in Boswell
'll only be gone a few weeks
Be back before you know it
-   - Two weeks later and we're in the rural countryside outside Kampala, Uganda
Sam on the roof of a bombed out school building with other white , working
Sam looks below to see a dozen black men dressed in the ragged fatigues of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army ()
Each is carrying an  47 and standing guard at various points around this compound
The lead soldier is a man named
three others we'll come to know as "", "" and "
" - It's later and we see Deng sitting underneath an awning by himself, working on his machine gun
Sam approaches
You Ugandan Army or what
What's that
Sudanese People's Liberation Army
We are freedom fighters
Name's Sam Childers
am Deng
There is a certain reserved nobility in this man, in the way he carries himself and speaks
An unwavering strength and self-reliance born from a lifetime of war and struggle
27 (re: Deng's weapon) Givin ya problems
Yes
bit
Double-feed
Sometimes
Lemme have a look
Deng hesitates, then hands his  over to Sam who pops the mag out and studies it
(') Yer mag is tight
See here
() The loads are feedin right to the barrel face
That's yer problem
Sam pulls out a knife and begins to work on the base plate of the mag as he explains
(') you need this plate to ramp into the chamber
that way yer brass won't get stuck
() there ya go, should be better
And Sam hands the weapon back
Thank you
No problem
Are you military
No, not me
ain't the military type
Ain't so good with bein told what to do
When did you learn about weapons
Sam considers the question for a moment
then simply says
28 Long time ago
Different life
-  - Fifteen or twenty volunteers lounging on cots in this dorm, playing cards, talking, smoking
And we find Sam off from the group, on his bunk, reading The Bible
(
) Hey Childers
Sam turns to find a British man in his late 20's named  standing next to him, thick Cockney accent, smoking a cigarette
Some of us are going into Kampala tomorrow night
Find ourselves a little fun this weekend
You in
was thinkin bout goin up north
You crazy
There's a civil war going on up there
know
-   - It's mid-day, blazing hot, and we see Sam approaching Deng
Hey, Deng, you wanna Coke
Sam offers him a can and he takes it
Thank you
Got a question for ya
Yes
wanna go into Sudan this weekend
Need someone to show me around
You interested
The others are going into Kampala
29 That ain't my speed no more
wanna see some country
Deng looks at him, surprised by the request
You want to see
-   - dirt road cutting through grassy plain stretching in every direction
and we see a    speeding toward us in the distance, kicking a rooster tail of dust high into the air
and as it gets closer we see 15 or 20 men piled onto the roof, hanging on for dear life as this bus bounces over the road
-  -   - Sam and Deng crammed into this crowded bus
They always drive this fast
Traveling is the most dangerous time in Sudan
If the rebels find you on the open road it would be very bad
An awkward silence as Deng stares out the window
Sam wanting to connect here, but Deng is reticent
You got kids, Deng
No
have no children
Where you from
little village called Aweil
Many hours from here
That's where your family is
And Deng simply says
My family was killed by
() Unyama is about two hours from here
We will stop there for lunch
30 Deng turns and looks out the window again, silent, quietly watching the land blur past
And Sam says nothing more, intuitively feeling this man's need to be alone in the moment
great, lost giant
,  - dense sea of people
20,000 displaced refugees living on top of each other
Life is lived out in the open here
women bent over brightly colored washtubs sloshing clothes in soapy water
smoke from giant cooking pots drifting into the air
semi-clothed children, some with even younger children on their hips, running everywhere
The poverty and hopelessness is overwhelming
And we see Sam and Deng walking through the camp
The Muslim North has tried to kill the Christian South for 30 years
Two million have lost their lives
Deng sweeping his hand, indicating the mass of refugees
(') these people have been driven from their villages, however these camps are not much better
-   ,  - row of wood sheds and worn nylon tents marks the hospital area
Each enclosure jammed with the desperately sick
Battle-weary move among them, doing what they can, caring for the ones who are most desperately ill
Cholera and Malaria are everywhere, there is little food and not enough  soldiers to protect everyone
Even here they worry the  will attack at night
And another  soldier comes up to Deng -- 1 () Are you from Kitgum
() Yes
1 () Someone wants to speak with you
31 Deng turns to Sam
'm sorry, Sam
'll be five minutes
Course, do what you gotta do
Deng leaves and now Sam is completely alone, taking in this mire of humanity all around him
And suddenly there's
-- two aid workers coming into this tent carrying a  on a stretcher
One of the aid workers looking around -- a white woman -- mid 30's -- her name is  , Regional Director of Doctors Without Borders
She sees Sam across the tent
Excuse me
You
Can you help please
Sam moving to her -- (') We need to transfer her to the bed
Get her shoulders
Sam grabbing the woman underneath the shoulders as another aid worker gets her feet
(') One, two, three
And they swing the woman over to a cot
but as they do the sheer piece of blood-stained muslin that was covering her face falls away
and we see that she has been mutilated
her lips cut off of her face
and now a  sweeps into the tent and begins to work on her
Sam and Agnete pushed back, away from the action
Sam still shocked by what he's seen
What happened to her face
The rebels cut off her lips because she argued
These are Kony's orders
Who's Kony
Agnete, suddenly suspicious, takes an appraising look of Sam
Who are you with
'm with Deng over there
32 What organization are you with
Working with a Christian group down South
Just up here takin a look around, seein a bit of the country
This isn't a tourist destination, this is a war zone
You stay in this area, you'll be killed
() Thank you for your help
And she walks off
,  - Establishing a bustling trading center on the border of Uganda and Sudan
Noisy and overpopulated, a maze of concrete and tin buildings, hundreds of people on the streets, riding bicycles, finishing their business before nightfall
- ,  - stale room with two cots, bare, institutional
Deng on the edge of his cot, pulling off his boots, taking off his jacket, getting comfortable
And we see Sam sitting on a small balcony overlooking the empty street below
Some say Joseph Kony is a wizard shapeshifter
He calls himself a Christian
He pulls a baggy of tobacco from his pocket and begins to roll a cigarette
(') but  say he is Satan, who devours his own people
Kony is the leader of the
He is the one we have been fighting for years
But there is very little we can do
Our weapons are old, and our boots are full of holes
We have been forgotten by the rest of the world
And now Deng turns to Sam
33 (') Why are you here
'cuse me
What are you looking for in this place
Ain't lookin for nuthin
Deng staring at him, skeptical
And then you will get your picture and go back to your life and all this will just be a story you tell your friends
/
- ,  - Sam has no response
and Deng lights his cigarette
and suddenly we hear voices
through the open window
children's voices
Sam peering into the darkness but seeing nothing
only empty streets
and then one-by-one
out of the darkness like apparitions
we see children coming up the street carrying bedrolls
some of them singing spiritual hymns as they walk
laughing as children do
at first just a dozen or so
and then more
fifty
a hundred
- ,  - Deng steps onto the balcony next to Sam
They are night commuters
They come from deep in the bush
Their parents send them out because it is safer to sleep here than in their own homes
Why
Because death comes at night in the villages and refugee camps
And we continue to watch this great migration of children
now streaming into this town
a few of them finding a dark corner just below us
unrolling their reed mats
huddling up against each other for the long night
(') These are the lucky one so far
The ones the rebels have not found
The invisible children
34 Sam watching them for another beat then suddenly turning, moving back into the room
(') Where are you going
-  - ,  - Sam coming down these steps
Deng following
( ) Sam
- ,  - Sam exiting the hotel, moving to a group of 5 children huddled on the sidewalk
Get up
let's go
The children looking up, surprised to see a white man here
(') Come on
The children getting to their feet
and Sam moves to another cluster of children up the block as Deng catches up to him
What are you doing
They ain't sleepin out here
Tell em they're comin inside
(to children on the ground) Ya'll get up
let's go
And Sam starts to move up the block further, wanting to gather up more children, but Deng stops him
Sam, there are too many
And he looks up the street and we see more children here than we thought
hundreds of young kids huddled on the streets
(') you can't help them all
Sam knows he's right
moment here as he looks to the children he's gathered, staring up at him
can help these here
35 - ,  - -- and a   are ushered into this small room
Sam pushing their cots against a wall so there's more space
Deng speaking to the children -- () Settle down
it's alright
you can sleep here till morning
-- and they begin to settle onto the floor
and now we notice a particular  in this group
maybe 8 years old
wearing bright and we watch as he and his  move to a corner of the room and unroll their mats
and eventually Sam turns off the lamp and we stay here in the dark
Sam on his cot, listening to these 12 little children breathing
their shifting bodies on the floor trying to get comfortable
and then
: - ,  - Sam's closed eyes
sound asleep
Just before dawn
Deng standing over him, shaking him awake
The  attacked a village last night
Sam looking up to him
(') You said you wanted to see
Sam sits up, looks around the hotel room and we see that it's empty
the children vanished
only a small, handmade toy on the ground which has been left behind
-  -   - Sam, Deng, and a few other   jammed into the flatbed of this truck, carrying heavy weapons, bouncing fast over this open dirt road
featureless savanna  into sporadic mud huts
the outskirts of a  in the distance
and thin columns of black smoke twisting into the air
and as the truck gets closer to the village we begin to pass walking along the side of the road
night commuters returning to their village
some of them huddled together, weeping
36 and we notice -- Sam notices -- the little boy in the , walking hand-in-hand with his sister, their faces quiet masks of fear as they move closer to their home
- ,  - The pickup arrives and Sam, Deng, and the other soldiers hop out
and this is what they see: Complete devastation
30 or 40 bodies mutilated and stacked outside smoking tukuls
Some children already here, on their knees, weeping next to the corpses of their parents
If you could smell the air it would smell of burnt flesh and death
Sam silent, aghast, just staring at the horror all around him
and now we see   and his sister arriving at the village
moving to their family's tukul and discovering their mother and father piled outside
Naked and burned alive
And the sister falls onto her mother's corpse and begins to wail as stands there -- frozen -- staring down at his dead parents -- and suddenly -- -- from inside the tukul
a small dog
a family pet
darting into the open
running across the dirt going after it, yelling his name
Sam watching the boy chasing after his dog, rounding a corner out of sight
for a moment
just the boy's voice calling after his dog
and then
muffled burst -- in the distance -- Sam, Deng, and the other soldiers running out of the village toward the explosion
- ,  - Sam, Deng, and the others arriving at the source of the explosion
And we see   laying on the side of the road
cut in half by a land mine
his dead eyes wide open with surprise
and Sam drops to his knees
lifting what's left of the boy into his arms and rocking him back and forth
and we watch as a terrible sadness overtakes him
something happening here
a fierce and overwhelming burden dropping into this man as he holds this dead boy
in the dirt
in the middle of this savage world
and as Sam puts it, his "life changed forever" in this moment
and we see him looking up to the heavens
37 tears streaming down his face
saying something we can't hear, but it's a promise
to God
To save the children of Sudan
- bright, fluorescent corridor filled with garish advertising and harried travelers rushing to make planes
and we find Sam coming down this concourse, carrying his duffle bag, his face expressionless
He reaches a revolving door but stops
doesn't pass through
sees Lynn, Paige, and his mother waiting for him on the other side
their happy, expectant faces
But they don't see him yet
and he just stays here
hidden
watching them through the glass
and as Sam puts it, at this moment he realized he would never look at his own family the same way again
in some way lost to them forever after what he saw on the side of road in Yei
and finally he forces a smile, pushes through the revolving door and we watch, from this side of the glass, as Paige leaps into his arms
Lynn and Daisy moving to him too, embracing him, welcoming him home
- '  -   - Paige brushing her teeth at the sink
Sam watching her from the doorway
You see any tigers over there
Naw, didn't see no tigers
But they do have them over in Africa
So  hear, but not where  was
Sure am glad you're home
Me too, bug
'm thinkin of a plane
It's late, you better get to bed
And he grabs her and carries her into the bedroom, plops her onto the bed
38 'mon, plane
'm thinkin of a plane
Sam giving in, playing their little game as she gets under the covers
You said plane, 'm thinkin of a train
You said train, 'm thinkin of a brain
You said brain, 'm thinkin of a
() Gotcha
Ok, you got me
You coulda said drain, or mane
like horse's hair
Sam bending over, kissing her forehead
Sweet dreams, bug
-   - Sam coming out of Paige's bedroom, pulling the door closed, finding Lynn waiting for him
You comin to bed
In a bit You ok
Just a long flight
She senses more but knows this man well enough not to push
and so she simply turns away
-   - Quiet
Just Sam on this porch all alone, been here for some time, eyes far off, images in his mind he can't seem to shake
39 And he steps into the yard
walking along the side of the house
just moving
trying to shed this feeling like snakeskin
and he comes to something on the ground which stops him dead in his tracks
something we don't see yet
and slowly he reaches down and picks up
One of Paige's toys
Soiled and faded and left in the dirt
And we watch him holding this forgotten doll
and what we see on his face ain't pretty
his world collapsing out from under him
trying to keep rein on his emotions
a battle he's losing
-   - Lynn stirs awake, looks next to her and realizes Sam never made it to bed the night before
- Lynn coming out the front door in her nightgown, sees a light on in a utility shed in the back
- Lynn slowly pushing open the door to find Sam on the floor, hunched over a pad of Paige's art paper
drawing
paper wads strewn all around him
been here all night
Baby, whatcha doin
He looks up
Makin plans
You been to bed yet
He gathers up a couple of the papers, moves to her
had a vision last night, Lynn
Crazy as it sounds, God spoke to me
He hands her a sheet of paper --  to see it's a crude drawing of building
(') 'm gonna build a church
church
40 Right across the street
Not like Faith United or Calvary Fellowship
Place that ain't gonna turn you away if you a drug addict or a prostitute or whatever
Place for sinners, just like me, who wanna hear the word of God
Lynn studying him, trying to judge how serious he is here
And Sam looking back at her, his eyes like we haven't seen them before
Sparkling
How we gonna pay for a church, Sam
We got money in the bank
Business is good
Besides,  own a construction company
() 'm gonna give us one heck of a good deal on the build
She smiles, shaking her head, catching his enthusiasm
Yer crazy
`Lil bit
What's that
He hands her the other paper --  to see it's a another drawing
That's the orphanage  wanna build
In Sudan
: -  ,
-  - (/2003) Eight months later and we're looking at a simple, cinder block church which is under construction
scattering of pickup trucks parked at the site and a flurry of activity
pouring cement, laying sheetrock, etc
And Sam in the middle of this crew, putting the finishing touches on a timber frame which is about to be raised
- ,
- Children at play, laughing, screaming, swinging on swing sets and digging in a sand pit
And we see Sam off to the side, leaning against a (new) black Harley, watching Paige playing in the group
41 (
) Sam Childers
Sam turns to see a , late 40's, leather vest, standing with his 12 year old
That's me
The Biker extends his hand, they shake
Hey bro, Ben Hobbes, knew each other long time ago
Yeah, Ben, how you doin
Daddy, 'm gonna go
, sweetie
She runs off
(') Goddamn, they grow up quick, don't they
Sure do
Hey, nuthin fer nuthin, Sam, but rumor has it you was puttin up a chapel over there in Central City
That's right
Gonna minister to anybody who's lookin for The Lord
That's good, man
Maybe you can do somethin bout your old friend, Donnie
What about em
He ain't doin so good, bro
But hey, good seein ya' man
42 - ,
- torn up house in a shitty part of town, windows spray painted black
Sam pulls up to the curb on his Harley, gets off, opens one of the bike's hard cases and pulls out the same   10 gage we've seen before
chambers a slug as he moves toward the house
- ,
- Dark, junkie squalor
Two or three people slumped on a ratty couch, strung-out, watching a flickering  -- and then -- Sam coming into the house -- sawed-off leveled -- junkies scrambling for cover --
--
-- Sam moving into -- -   - Sam comes around the corner and finds himself face-to-face with a pointing a
357  -- eyes amped up and wild -- shaking -- a stand-off -- and Sam sees a body on a bare mattress in the b
g
-- bone thin and pale -- spent hypodermic hanging out of his arm -- It's Donnie
'm here for that boy right there
You gonna get in the way a that
-- not sure how this is gonna go -- and then the shakes his head "no" -  ,
- Donnie in a bed, covers pulled up to his neck and he's shaking bad, retching in a bucket, deep in the throes of a detox
Sam and Lynn here doing what they can, toweling off his forehead, trying to keep him warm, as Donnie pulls the sheets tighter, gritting his teeth, shaking his head
can't do this
Look at me
God don't make trash, boy
Now he ain't givin up on you, so don't give up on him, you hear me
And somehow Donnie finds strength in his words, and in Sam's hand touching his head, and he nods
43 -  ,
-  - (/2003) bright Sunday morning and we're staring at the cinder block church which is almost completely finished
the sound of a garage band coming from inside, playing an unlikely rendition of a spiritual hymn
and a handful of people, dressed for service, moving up the cement stairs into
-    - And we see Donnie, dressed in his biker jacket and a buttondown shirt, sober for the moment, greeting people as they come through the front door
Standing next to him is Daisy handing out programs
Welcome to Shekinah Fellowship Church
-    -   - Still under construction
Exposed beams and bare insulation on the walls
There's a small riser at the front of the hall with an altar, organ, and the   playing the rocked-out hymn
handful of people here sitting in pews
in clean overalls, ,  still dressed in their riding leathers, listening to the garage band and chatting
And now we see Lynn and Paige (11) standing near the back
Lynn nervous, checking her watch
-    - Sam on his knees, sleeves rolled up to his elbows, wrenching a leaking pipe
Lynn and Daisy walk in
It's five-til and he still ain't here
Sam hearing this, moving to his feet, toweling off his hands
You call him
( ) Try him again
Lynn exits and Daisy steps forward, shuts the door behind her
Just she and Sam here alone now
You like this dress, Sam
What, mom
44 You ain't never seen this one
bought it a long time ago
Been keepin it for a special occasion
It's nice
never told you this but when  was pregnant with you, now this was way back, probably 1960, when yer daddy and  was still in Grand Rapids, a Pastor prophesied over me
Pulled me right up on stage and laid his hands on my belly and told me  was gonna have a Preacher for a son
(smiling at the thought) Yer daddy and  were so proud
remember we went home and neither of us could sleep all night
Just laid there and talked bout you, bout what was comin
just built a church
ain't no preacher
Yes you are
You were born to it
Just took you a little ways to get here
-    - Sam entering at the back of the chapel, taking a moment to appreciate what he's looking at: 20 or 30 people here in the church that he built
dream realized
And he walks down the center aisle, shaking hands with a few people, climbing steps to the altar and switching on the microphone
(to the band) Thank you, Tommy
You boys is soundin pretty good up here
Sam turning to the crowd, clearing his throat, clearly nervous
(') wanna thank ya'll for comin out for the first day of worship here at Shekinah Fellowship Church
Some applause
Lynn and Paige sitting with Daisy who is beaming
45 (') The guest preacher we had booked today ain't shown up
so  thought 'd say a word or two
An awkward beat
(') Lotta yous been wonderin what made me wanna build this here church
Seein as ain't the best seed in the bunch  can understand that
beat, considering what to say
and he begins
(') Buncha years ago  was runnin from some bad fellas in the woods over there by Cleary
Those old boys was comin after me hard and  reached in my bag lookin for my old shotgun but it was gone
My momma had took it out when  wasn't lookin and put this bible in there instead
Sam holding up a worn bible, and we start to notice something here
a transformation happening in this man as he speaks to these people
His nervousness falling away and a natural charisma taking over
(') Well  figured  was done for, so  sat down under an old tree with this useless book and  waited
And we see the congregation hanging on his every word, identifying with this man standing before them
One of their own
(') and then the strangest thing happened
Them boys ran right on past me
Didn't even see me sittin there
Now the way  figure it, things would have turned out pretty different if  had pulled out that shotgun instead of this here Bible
And that's probably the first time  can remember God savin my butt
() God
and my momma
Some laughter and applause
(') Figure least  could do was build em both this church
And the congregation responds with a Hallelujah
46 - Sam holding Paige, her face buried in his shoulder, crying
Be back soon as  can
You're gonna miss my play
Have momma videotape it for me, k
Now gotta git
Lynn pulling Paige off, kissing Sam on the lips
Call us when you can
will
Sam turning to Donnie, and we see he's back to the hulking man he once was
(') You watch out for em while 'm gone, ya hear
That's done, buddy
Sam winks, slaps Donnie on the shoulder, as we -- : - ,  - - And we see a line of  soldiers (including , , and ) sitting in the dirt, pulling on  , smiling, spit- polishing them to a high shine
Sam and Deng watching the soldiers
You came all this way to bring us new boots
-  - Deng driving fast down this bumpy road
Sam in the passenger seat
Nineteen, Marco, and
in the flatbed of this truck, ever watchful
47 Right here, stop the truck
-     - Sam already out of the truck, moving into the bush
Deng following
Sam, wait
But he's not listening, moving through the scrub to a small clearing
walking around
(') It is not safe here
Sam kneeling down, picking up a handful of red dirt, letting it trickle through his fingers
This is it
-        - Establishing a busy trading town on the border of Sudan and Uganda
And we see a small crowd of villagers standing underneath a tarp, watching a small color  (the only  for miles) -- on the screen we see a black man in a military uniform giving a fiery speech -- this is   -- one of the good guys -- the founder of the - ,  - tight, cramped office filled with villagers
Two or three men here at desks handling the administration of life in the bush: renewing travel papers, registering newborn children, hearing complaints from local farmers, etc
And we see Sam and Deng at one of these desks, a topographical map splayed out in front of them
This is not a good idea
think it's a heckuva good idea
It would be better further south
Closer to Kampala
If  wanted to be closer to Kampala, 'd be closer to Kampala
wanna be right here
Sam pointing to the map
The Administrator turning to Deng -- 48 () He should not be this far north
What are you sayin
The villages in this area are very remote, Mr
Childers
There is nothing there
Then it seems to me them people need help the most
(to Deng, Arabic) He will be killed
Talk to me
The Administrator turning to him, laying it out simply -- This is in the war zone, Mr
Childers
The  will kill you here
don't think you understand me, so lemme make it real clear to ya
didn't pick this land -- God did
'  -  -  - What we're looking at is the modest beginning of The Angels of East Africa Children's Orphanage
cluster of tukuls and 2 or 3 rudimentary wood buildings built on the dirt Sam first let trickle between his fingers
And we see life already finding it's place within these bamboo walls
Acholi  laying brick on what will eventually become a schoolhouse and chapel
And we find Sam with two or three small  who are crying for no apparent reason
He's on his knees, trying his best to soothe them but he is way out of his depth here
And now we see Deng in the b
g
approaching with a powerfully built Ugandan woman in her late 40's
() Sam
this is Betty
She is from the village of Kotido
few miles from here
49 Good to meet you Betty
Betty, no reaction
Just the incessant crying of the children in the b
g
She is knowing that you need someone to run the orphanage
'm lookin for somebody who can keep the place in order
Make sure things is taken care of when 'm away
She can do this
She's gonna have to take care of the children too, make sure they're fed, fix em when they're sick
Can she do that
Betty hears this, turns to the crying children and softly says -- () Quiet now
-- and instantly their crying stops
Tell her she's hired
- '  - We see Betty and another Camp Woman () moving through this room carrying lanterns, helping the children get ready for sleep -- () You two share a blanket and tomorrow we will find another
() Shhhh, it's time to shut your eyes
And we see Sam here too, doing what he can, tucking in a few of the kids, starting to make a connection with these children
'  - And we see a handful of  soldiers stationed around the perimeter of the compound, standing guard
Sam and Deng sitting next to a lantern by the front gate
50 You know what's funny
In English your name means "darn it
" What is this `darn it
' Deng
It means `shucks
' You know, like you stub your toe and you go "ahhhhh, deng
" Get it
( ) This is not funny
In my language, in Arabic, names are very important
They tell you everything about a man
( ) Your name proceeds you wherever you go
You are Sam
This is how you are known
In my language this means something
Sam feeling terrible, realizes he's offended him
'm sorry, buddy
It was just a joke
Quiet, awkward, just the two of them sitting here quietly for a long beat
Finally
(') What does Sam mean in Arabic
Small penis
And Deng smiles brightly
Sam realizing he's been played
And Deng starts to
deep, guttural, infectious laugh
Sam joining him, and we sense that at this moment these two have become friends
And gradually their laughter subsides, and it's quiet again
Can  ask you a question
Of course
You believe in God
Deng considering this for a beat, and then
was raised to believe there was a God in heaven
() 51 (') But it is impossible to live here, to see what  have seen, and not turn your back on him
Maybe you'll invite him in again one day
don't think so
: - The heavy stillness of an African summer night
Only the sound of Kestrel hawks screeching far off in the distance, hunting prey
and the drone of African Cicadas buzzing all around us
- '  - The children sprawled on their mats sound asleep
'  - '  - Deng and a few other soldiers sleeping on bedrolls
'  - '  - Sam sitting on his cot
He rips open an airmail package and pulls out a small , slides it in a , hits play -- we see Paige, dressed in a pilgrim costume, performing in a Thanksgiving Day play
Her voice coming through the tiny speakers as she recites her lines
Sam smiling at what he's watching
- '  - few of the  soldiers sitting next to their weapons in the dark, smoking, tossing beads into a carved wooden trough, playing the ancient game of Mancala -- #2 () That was a mistake
#3 () Where
#2 () Right here
your third "house" is open
52 Soldier #3 reacting to his mistake as -- --
10  12 The  soldiers oblivious to the advance
'  - '  - Sam watching Paige's play -- when suddenly -- -- machinegun fire popping o
s
-- Sam hitting the ground, scrambling for cover -- '  - -- Sam rushing out of his tukul -- sees the front gate from a grenade blast -- bamboo fence burning -- the death song of AK47's howling in the darkness -- -- Sam hustling across the compound -- joining Deng and another soldier behind a makeshift shed -- How many are there
Two squads
() There -- and there
Sam peering around the corner -- sees   in the blackness -- maybe 15 or 20 rebels moving through the bush like specters -- flanking the compound -- Where are your men
don't know
Sam looking around, realizing the rest of the  soldiers are scattered throughout the compound firing randomly into the dark
They're gonna pick us off like this
Sam, split-second decision here -- and he starts to sprint across the compound to -- 53 - '  - -- the children cowering in the corners -- Betty and Rose here trying to calm them down -- () Stay down
-- stay down
-- We are protected
-- Sam bursting through the door -- -- Betty
Get em to the church right now
() Quickly
() Understand
-- Betty nodding as Sam rushes out -- - '   - -- Sam bombing into this shed -- quickly opening a metal chest and pulling out an AK47 and mags of ammo -- - '  - -- Sam scrambling across the compound with the  -- moves next to Deng and pops a mag into the machinegun -- Get yer men back to the church
That's our best shot
'll cover you
And Sam starts to open up the  -- laying down a curtain of suppression fire as Deng shouts to his men -- () To the church
-- -- and they start to fall back to the center of the orphanage -- - '  - Betty and the other Camp woman herding the terrified children into this building -- the only brick structure on the compound -- and then Deng, Marco,
and the other  soldiers coming in -- moving to the window holes and returning fire -- 54 - '   - Sam sweeping the  back and forth, trying to hold off the rebels as long as he can -- and then -- More of the fence eviscerated by a grenade blast
--    -- Sam becoming overwhelmed in the fight -- firing as he retreats back into the compound -- - '  - -- Sam storming into the chapel -- turning to Betty -- (meaning the children) Put em in the middle
Betty and the other woman do exactly that -- they move the children into a tight group in the center of the room
() Down here
-- in the center
-- all of you
-- stay down
'  - Rebels moving through the compound, firing into tukuls and setting everything on fire
- '  - Sam, Deng and the other soldiers returning fire -- () Four on the right
() There are too many
Just keep firin
Sam starting to open up with his  -- Krakakakakakak
-- spent shells showering down around the children huddled in the middle of the room
55 '  - Rebels swarming around the chapel, but reaching a point where they can't advance any further -- -- and we see a rebel squat behind a shed and screw an  into a launcher -- he pops up -- levels the launcher at the chapel and -- Krakakakakak
He's cut down before he's able to fire -- - '  - -- Sam sweeping his  across the compound -- the other soldiers burning through magazines and reloading -- rebels firing back -- Betty and the children crowded on the floor in the middle of this -- and we stay in this little chapel -- watching this last stand -- until we -- : '  - And we see the entire orphanage has been razed to the ground
Betty and a few of the children picking through the burned out buildings and torched tukuls, looking for anything salvageable
Deng, Nineteen, and some of the  soldiers loading the corpses of rebels into the back of the truck
and now we find Sam staring at the brick chapel in the middle of the compound
The only structure that remains
Everything else -- his entire dream -- in ashes
-  ,
- And we see Lynn pushing a shopping cart down the aisle, past shelves loaded with packaged produce
And we hear
Lynn digging the cell phone out of her purse -- Hello
- ,  -  () And we find Sam sitting at a table along this dusty, crowded street
His duffelbag on the ground next to him
( ) It's me
-  ,
- Lynn immediately senses something wrong
56 You ok
- ,  -  () And we see that he's not
This man is empty, alone, defeated
They burned it to the ground
All of it
Ain't nuthin left

- She hears the anguish in his voice
Where are you
- ,  - Nimule
-  ,
- '  (
) 'm comin home
And we're watching her here, clocking the resignation in his voice
moment of quiet for both of them
Lynn sensing the dimensions of his heartache
All she wants to do is bring him home, hold him close, ease his pain
but she knows that's not what he needs
not this man
- ,  - '  (
) Sam
Yeah
'  (
) Can you hear me
can hear you
-  ,
- And we see her move around a corner into an empty aisle, away from the other shoppers
And she says
57 Then quit feelin sorry for yerself
Them children have had their whole lives burned to the ground and worse
How many of them you see givin up
- ,  - And we watch Sam listening, finding strength in what this woman says next
'  (
) God gave you purpose, Sam Childers
Now stop yer cryin, get off yer butt and build it again
'  - Giving us a sense that many months are passing
-- Sam and a crew of   hauling the charred remnants of tukuls and burned building out of the compound on their backs
-- The remainder of the bamboo fence that once surrounded the orphanage being torn down
-- Nineteen, Marco,
and a few other  soldiers cutting the bush away from the edge of the compound with machetes
Cut it all down
so they got nowhere to hide
-- Sam, Deng and the crew of village men digging post holes around the perimeter of the orphanage
1 () How far
() All the way around
-- The men sinking metal beams into the holes with cement, then surrounding the compound with heavy gage
-- New  being built from brick
An
'
And finally, Sam laying the last brick on the chapel in the center of the compound
Completing it
- '  - simple administrative office with a short-wave radio and sat phone
Sam here, sitting at a desk when we hear a knock at the door
58 Come on in
The door opens and we see Deng
Preacher, you need to come see this
'  - Sam following Deng to the center of the compound where we see 5 or 6 camp women (including Betty and Rose) dressed in colorful robes and headdresses
Maybe 80 children here, quietly sitting in the dirt, watching the women
Nineteen, Marco,
and the rest of the soldiers here too, watching from the side
What's goin on
The Acholi people were farmers before they were driven from their ancestral homeland
Each year they blessed the soil before a planting
And now the women begin to move in unison
singing an ancient Acholi song as one of the older orphan boys beats a small drum in accompaniment
(') () They are saying that fire brings strength and ashes abundance
The women continuing their dance
moving in a tight circle and stomping their feet as they sing
(') () when the land burns, the next year the soil produces more
And now Betty peels away from the group and approaches Sam, talking to him directly in Arabic
() The children are your fields
() she says you are a farmer and these children are your crops
59 Sam looking to the 80 little orphans watching this from the side
and now Betty bends down and scoops up a bit of ashen earth and runs her finger across his forehead, blessing him
() and this ground will grow them tall
and this ground is richer now and they will grow stronger because of it
standing here with his ashen face, staring at these people in front of him -- his African family
- '  - Days later and we see Sam here with Nineteen and a few other soldiers, eating lunch, trying to learn their language
And it's humorous to these guys as Sam tries to pronounce some words in Arabic
And suddenly we hear  coming from outside
- '  - Sam coming out fast, sees soldiers pulling open the front gate as pickup trucks speed into the compound --  military trucks - - skidding to a stop
Sam rushing over as soldiers help two   out of one of the trucks
Both are around 5 years old, injured and crying
And then a third child is lifted out in a makeshift stretcher -- this is  - - 10 years old -- her broken body limp and bleeding profusely -- mumbling something to herself in Arabic over-and-over again -- - '   - --
--   as the children are hauled into this clinic -- Betty taking care of Alice -- the worst off -- hooking her up to an  as Sam moves to her bedside -- the little girl still mumbling quietly -- What is she saying
She is asking what she did wrong
Sam taking Alice's hand in his
very slowly her beautiful eyes open and she sees him
and says something in Arabic
(') () She is asking if you are `The Preacher
' 60 () Tell her she's gonna be ok
Betty translates and Alice smiles faintly
and now one of the other camp women comes over and Sam steps back so they can work
- '   - Sam coming out of the infirmary and finding Deng here with a few of the  soldiers who brought the children
Where did they find em
Their village was hit out Adjumani
Off Sam, hearing this, we
: - '   - And we see Sam and Deng sitting outside the infirmary, exhausted, been here all night waiting
And now the door opens and Betty comes out
She looks down at them and simply shakes her head
And we know Alice is dead
And it looks like a grenade has gone off inside Sam
And suddenly he grabs an  and gets up, seething, walks off
Sam
- '   - Sam walking fast through the compound
Deng following
Where are you going
Adjumani
Sam, please wait
ain't waitin
You wanna see what waitin gets ya
Take a look in that buildin over there
Sam reaching the  and starting to gear up
61 the plaintive wail of an Acholi
haunting
ethereal
and then a chorus of voices rising up
taking us to
-  -     - Bombing down this rutted, red dirt road
The engine at full tilt
Sam, Deng, Nineteen, Marco, and
jammed into this truck riding in dead silence
AK47's bouncing between their knees
only the sound of the   playing as we watch these men
a grave stillness on their faces
thinking of what men do just before their own death
-     - We see two   approaching in the distance
a and a   behind it
-  - Four   squatting in the flatbed of this truck carrying AK47's
We recognize one of the boys as the younger brother from the opening scene --
-  - With two   in this Jeep as they drive down this road past bombed-out vehicles
and in the distance we see the smoldering wreckage of a transport truck on the side of the road
the thick smoke hanging over the road like a black curtain
blocking out vision of the road ahead
and the Jeep punches into the black smoke followed by the pickup truck
and we're lost in the swirling haze for a moment before coming out the other side
and this is what we see -- -- standing in the middle of the road ahead of us shouldering a -- the   see him just as -- -- an  streaks right at us and  --
-- and the Jeep flips onto it's side -- - -- the driver slamming it into  - - accelerating back into the curtain of smoke -- trying to get the fuck out of there when -- BBrrraaaappp
30    across the front hood -- - -- and we see
behind the
30 cal -- opening it up -- --
-- blasting the engine compartment of the truck, trying to disable it -- 62 - -- the pickup truck reversing out of the black smoke -- -- going off the road into a ditch --  and the other boys bailing out of the flatbed --    piling out of the cab -- scrambling for cover behind the truck
- Sam, Deng,
and the others hustling through the smoke and finding cover
From Sam's vantage point he sees rebels hiding behind the disabled truck for cover -- shooting back -- a withering firefight -- the big
30 cal  offscreen but the truck is protecting the rebels -- no clear shot -- - William and the other child soldiers here with two   -- crouched behind the truck for cover -- the   returning fire, but the children aren't moving, scared shitless
William peers around the truck and sees Sam fifty yards away, turns to the boys next to him
() It's the white preacher
The other boys reacting, this means something to them
And now one of the   turns to the children
And he pops up and returns fire, but the boys don't move
- running through the smoke toward Sam
He hits the ground and starts to screw an  into his launcher
he wants to hit the transport truck, but Sam shakes his head, waves him off
No shot
There are children behind the truck
Marco hears this, ditches the  and picks up his
(') Cover me
Marco laying down suppression fire as Sam sprints across the road -- advancing on the transport truck -- firing his  from the hip -- bullets zinging past him -- he dives behind a berm and finds himself next to Deng
Neither man says a word as they jam fresh mags into their 's, gunfire erupting all around them
63 - The adult rebels continue fighting -- alternately popping up from behind the truck and returning fire
The   realizing that William and the other boys still aren't fighting -- Fight you cowards
But William and the other boys don't move, and the Adult Rebel keeps shooting until his mag clicks empty
He looks around and sees an on the ground, picks it up, arms it -- - Sam and Deng behind the berm
Sam peers over just as  misses him by inches
He drops back
Why don't you just go home
What
This is not your war
You leavin
Deng shakes his head -- (') Well then,  ain't leavin neither
Sam chambers a round, pivots around the berm as -- - -- the Adult Rebel stands up with the  -- fires
-- at the same instant William shoots him in the head -- he jerks --
-- the missile launching at a bad angle as -- streaking directly at him -- hitting the ground short -- -
-- For a long beat
only silence
and then slowly the white begins to fade
and we see Sam flat on his back
eyes blinking open
shell-shocked
staring up at blue sky
and then a shadow coming over him
someone stepping into his
64 it's William, hands held open in surrender, staring curiously at this strange white man laying in the dirt
and now Deng and Marco appear next to Sam and help him to his feet
And we see the battle is over
The remaining child soldiers slowly emerging from behind the  truck
laying down their weapons and walking toward Sam
joining William
staring at this white man in front of them
William reaches into his pocket and
Deng and Marco  -- lifting their 's -- "Don't move
Don't move
" -- but the boy only pulls out a
the one he grabbed just before his capture
a picture of him and his older brother
standing next to each other smiling
() Have you seen my brother
- '  - 80 children laying on the floor on reed mats, getting ready for sleep
And we find William in mid-conversation with a young boy named Anthony
Where are you from
Jabal
Were you with the rebels
Anthony nods
William pulls out his photograph
(') Did you know my brother
He was called Christopher
Anthony studying the photograph
(') He has a funny left eye
It looks the other way sometimes
Do you remember him
No
William folding up the photograph, getting up, moving to another little boy a few feet away
kneeling next to him
and so he continues
am William
Were you with the rebels
65 - '  - soldier cuts off the generator and the compound goes black
- And we see Sam on his cot when the light goes out
He leans over and torches a small Kerosene lamp next to him
- The children on their mats in the dark now
quiet
a few of the younger ones whimpering, starting to cry
the darkness becoming too much
reminding them of past horrors
and then we hear a in this dark room
singing quietly
an ancient African lullaby
and then other little voices joining in
singing this song they all know
a song their mother's once sang to them
'  - '  - Sam hearing the soft chorus drift across the compound
somehow finding comfort in it too
blowing out the lamp and laying here in the dark
listening to the children sing
'  - life springing up in the camp
daylight breaking
a routine seen here
Betty, Rose and the other camp women arriving at the orphanage
cooking fires being lit
soldiers drinking cups of strong coffee, warming themselves after a long night
and Sam coming out of his tukul carrying his duffle bag
discovering William curled up next to his door, sleeping on a mat in the dirt
been there all night
William stirring awake, seeing Sam above him and scrambling to his feet
Mornin, buddy
William, no response
Just staring up at him
(') Ain't you gonna say nuthin
William, nothing
(') Ok then
And Sam walks across the compound followed by William a few paces behind
and he reaches Deng, Betty, Nineteen, and a few of the other volunteers waiting by the truck
66 ( ) Looks like you've got yourself a bodyguard
Guess  do
Sam tosses his bag into the back, says goodbye to everyone
(') Take care of things while 'm gone, ok
will, Preacher
They shake hands and Sam gets into the truck
and we see William already here, sitting in the backseat
You can't come with me, buddy
(to William, Arabic) Get out of there
But William isn't moving
(') () Come on
-- out
-- and finally Deng reaches in and grabs him
tries to pull him out but he fights back
yelling as Deng drags him out of the truck
-  - Sam turning around in his seat as we pull away from the compound
and he sees William still struggling in Deng's arms
and finally he breaks free and  for the truck as it drives off
fast as he can
chasing Sam until he no longer can
: / -  ,
- And we see two teens moving toward the sound of a crowd coming from inside the church, responsive, "Hallelujah
"
and then Sam's voice over it all
(
) In your actions you give service to the Lord
67 -    -   - Sam at the pulpit in mid-sermon
There is an air of Fire and Brimstone to what we're watching here
electric
the congregation listening in rapt attention
he's not interested in your good thoughts
your good intentions
he wants your hands
your backs
your sweat
your blood to pour into the foundation that will build up his kingdom
Ad-libbed  and
and now we see Lynn, Daisy, Donnie and Paige in the congregation listening
as we go -- / -    - Lynn and Sam walking through the facility, and we see this place is alive with activity
More than just a church, this is a community center
Lynn opening a door and we see a Volunteer here with a dozen little children running around this playroom
We started daycare last month
Monday thru Friday from 8 to 2
Sundays after first worship for a few hours if anybody needs it
How you doin, Sue
Good
Hey Pastor
Sue
Lynn pulling the door closed and they continue
moving down a set of stairs to the basement where we see children and parents
some of them playing ping-pong and air hockey
others in a corner rehearsing for a Christmas play
(') Been thinkin we need to put up a playground
Swings
Some things the kids can climb on
We can't build anymore
Not for awhile
You said Sundays has been full
Turn outs been good, but that don't mean people is givin money
() 68 (') Economy is in trouble, construction business is slow
Times is tight
Be good for them kids, Lynn
They got the playground over in Cairnbrook
And they can play at the school on weekends if they want Sam turning to her -- Not talking bout here
Talkin about the orphange
Lynn catching up to him now, realizing his head is still back in Africa
-   - Sam working on his Harley
Donnie entering in the b
g
What'cha workin on, buddy
Trouble with the push rods  think
She's runnin kinda rough
Shoulda kept that mild in there `stead a buildin up a hot rod
Let's see whatcha got here
Donnie moving next to him, working on the bike
(') never had these problems when we was runnin solid lifters, huh
Used to fix them old shovelheads on the side of the road with a buckknife and a wire hanger
Remember that year we went to the Freakers Ball
Sam smiling
think that old `78 broke down five times on that trip
69 Sounds about right
Shoot, we had more fun tryin to get there than when we finally did
Sam and Donnie share a laugh
(') Can  talk to you about somethin
Yep
'm glad 'm walkin with the Lord and all, but sometimes  ain't sure 'm gonna be able to do what he wants me to do
The Lord don't ask for nuthin you can't deliver, buddy
And yer one tough ole boy
Sometimes  ain't so sure how tough  am
And we see in Donnie's eyes just how troubled he is
Why don't we pray together then
And they both take a knee, bowing their heads as Sam continues
(') Our gracious Heavenly Father, bless us with the strength to carry on in your name
And grant us, in our darkest hours, the understandin that you are always by our side
And we leave these two men, their heads bowed in quiet supplication, next to this Harley, praying for strength
-   - ,
-  (/2004) Four or five gleaming sedans on this showroom floor
And we see Sam sitting across from  , late 40's, gold Rolex
from what  heard, you built yourself one helluva church over there in Central City
70 Still got a ways to go, but we're gettin there
You should come on by one of these Sundays, bring the family
That's nice of you, but we're at Calvary now
Bit more our speed over there think
Sam, getting down to business
Reverand Carlton gives a mean sermon, puts me to shame
Anyway Bill, 'm here cause  wanna talk to you about what we're doin over there in Africa
Course  know about what you're doin
Helluva thing helpin out those kids, Sam
Thank you, but 'm gonna be straight with ya
We're hurtin for money
If we had a little bit more support from people like yourself sure would help things run a lot smoother over there
Bill feeling the rub, shaking his head
Sam, look, everybody is feelin the pinch around here
hear that, but you gotta understand that them kids over there got nuthin mean nuthin, Bill, and 'm not asking for much
How much you lookin for
Five thousand dollars
Jesus Christ, Sam
Five thousand dollars
That keeps them doors open for another six months
71 People are losin their jobs left and right round here
Tough to be askin for five thousand dollars for a buncha African children half-way around the world
Sam shifting, not giving up, coming at him another way
You're right
We got problems right here
But with that kinda money we could feed them kids, house them kids
Bill staring at him, saying nothing, on the spot
Sam hoping that somehow he's reached this man
And finally Bill stands up
Alright, tell you what, lemme see what can do
Sam feeling this victory, flashing a smile, shaking Bill's hand
Ok
Why don't you and the family come over to the house next Sunday
We're havin a little barbeque, ok
Sounds good
- Upscale French provincial in suburban Johnstown
"barbeque" is underway
15 couples here with their kids and a handful of waiters in white-tie offering champagne and hors d'oeuvres to the guests
-- and we see a perky woman in her late 40's coming through the crowd, blonde hair from a bottle, accessorized to the hilt, holding a glass of white wine
She opens the door to find Sam, Lynn, and Paige standing in the doorway
Well, come on in
And they enter
Lynn smiling awkwardly, dressed in the same yellow dress we saw her in previously
her only dress
and Sam looking around this enormous room
(') Ya'll must be the Childers
Welcome
'm Shannon, Bill's ball-n-chain
72 Smiling, a joke she loves
'm Lynn, this here is Sam, our daughter Paige
Good to meet you
(
) There he is
Everybody turning to see the car dealer coming through the crowd, smiling, a little drunk
- introductions and then
Glad ya'll could make it
Get on in here and meet some people
Bill ushering them deeper into the house
quick intros to a few guests as they pass
Sam, Lynn, and Paige taking it all in
starting to sense the dimensions of this massive house
the waiters in their pressed jackets offering them food
the extravagance
like nothing they've ever seen
Bill pulling Sam off from the crowd so it's just the two of them
taking an envelope from his jacket and handing it to him
(') This is a little somethin for the kids, ok
What we were talking about
Thank you, Bill
Forget it
Now c'mon, can  get ya a mojito or somethin
-   - Sam coming into this bathroom and locking the door
taking the envelope out of his pocket and tearing it open
pulling out a personal check --   to see it's in the amount of $150 Sam face, and it's disgust we see in his eyes
- Front door opening fast and Lynn and Paige coming out, followed by Sam, pushing them along
Sam
73 Why we leavin so soon
Shannon appearing in the doorway in the b
g
, calling after
Everything alright
Lynn turning to respond, but Sam keeps her moving forward, down the driveway, past the line of parked 's and Mercedes to their truck at the curb
Get in the car
What's wrong
As they load into the truck
Sonuvabitch is cryin pour-mouth to me and he's livin in the damn Taj Mahal
Sam
asked him for five-thousand dollars to feed a buncha motherless babies and you know what he gave me
(taking out the check, wadding it up) Hundred and fifty bucks
That's it
Handed it to me like it was gold bouillon
Sonuvabitch spent more than that on salsa for his party
- -- Sam coming into the house, enraged, followed by Lynn
He moves to his gun cabinet, grabs a hidden key, unlocks it
What are you doin
've had it with these people and all their bullshit about wantin to help
And he starts pulling out weapons
shotguns and assault rifles
stuffing them into an oversize gun bag
Sam Childers
74 Lynn reaching for him and he grabs her wrist
tightly
staring at her with dark eyes
flash of the "old" Sam Childers here when he says
Stay outta my way
And for the first time in years this woman is scared
He lets go of her wrist and continues to fill the bag -- and we go -- - ,  - Sam coming out followed by the Shop Owner
'm sorry, twenty-five hundred is the best  can do for them gun
to see Lynn's car parked at the curb, Sam pointing to it
Throw in the car for five
The Shop Owner considering, as we go
-  - Windy, pissing rain
And we see Sam walking up this rural road, hands in his pockets, head down
the only human for miles
trudging through this shitstorm completely alone
: '  - And we see Sam with a group of men working in the sweltering heat
laying brick
adding another room to the children's dorm
and he squints into the distance, sees a cloud of dust on the horizon, cars coming closer
- '  - Seven or eight heavily armed vehicles coming through the gate
Maybe 20 or 30  soldiers guarding a black  in the middle of this motorcade
Nineteen waving his hand, yelling as the cars pass -- () It's Garang
-- It's Garang
-- Palpable excitement ripples through the compound
Sam's soldiers grabbing their weapons and forming a ragged line near the Suburban as it stops
75 the back door to the Suburban opens and a black man, dressed in shirtsleeves and slacks, steps out
The same man we saw giving the fiery speech on the little outdoor  in Nimule earlier -- Sam turns to Deng -- Who's this guy
That's our leader
John Garang
Deng nods as we go
- '   - Sam and Garang walking through the middle of camp, trailed by a squad of  bodyguards and camp children
They call you Preacher
Is this what should call you
Sam is fine
hear what you have done for the and  am grateful
We can thank God for his blessins
Yes, we can
How many children do you look after, Sam
Couple hundred with us here
Feed another thousand a day from nearby villages
Anyone who shows up hungry gets a meal
And they continue through the camp
few of the children running up to Garang, touching the cuff of his shirt, then sprinting away
What you are doing is noble, but too dangerous
must advise you to stop risking your life in our struggle
76 Until someone starts fightin for these children, 'm the one that's gonna do it
You are stubborn, aren't you
As a mule
Garang smiling, an instant affinity for this man
You and  come from very different worlds, but we are not so dissimilar
And another child runs up to Garang, touching him, and then sprints away giggling
(') founded the  in order to fight for the future of Sudan because nobody else would
We fight for freedom from the government in Khartoum, for the right to vote, and for the right to worship any god one may choose
More children running up
Garang touching their heads
(') But most important to me is our struggle for the children
Their laughter has been lost to this country for far too long
() There are Peace Talks scheduled for the end of August in Naivashu
'd like you to come as my guest
Talkin bout peace in a room somewhere is a waste of time
You gotta go out and make it
You are correct, but we must fight them at every level
Part of my battle is waged in those rooms
We must talk of peace, but keep our rifles ready for war
Sam turning to him, coming to an understanding here
Realizing that both of them are warriors in the same fight
(') Maybe together you and  can make Sudan free once again
77 And now we see they have arrived at the brick chapel in the middle of the compound
Garang turning to him, eyes suddenly becoming dark
(') There is a cost for freedom, Sam
price for the future of these people
Some pay with their lives, others pay in different ways
() My only hope is that your cost is not too great
' '
'  -   - Donnie tucking Paige into bed, making it up as he goes, clearly out of his depth here but wanting to do it right
You say prayers or somethin
Already did
Ok then, sweet dreams
Ain't you gonna read me a book
Ahh, Paige, you know  don't read so good
Then let's play a game
Ok
'm thinkin of a dog
What about it
Never mind, Donnie
Ok
78 Dad usually kisses me on the forehead before he leaves
You can do that
Sure  can
And Donnie does just that, bends down and kisses Paige on the head
(') Sweet dreams
And now we see Lynn in the hallway having just witnessed this through the cracked door, keenly feeling Sam absence in this moment
'  - And we see Sam, Betty and Rose leading a group of children, their hands covering their eyes so they can't see, into a clearing behind one of the dorms
Keep em closed
little bit more
() Keep your eyes closed
(stern, Arabic) Michael
Cover your eyes
No peeking
keep comin'
The children inching forward, following his voice, until
(') Ok, stop
Open your eyes
() Open your eyes
And we see a hundred little eyes popping open, staring at something off screen, confused for a split second at what they're looking at
to see a : two or three battered swingsets, a few see-saws, and a jungle gym soldered out of metal pipe
And the kids  for it, climbing all over the jungle gym like ants
hitting the swing-sets
and then we hear it
something we realize we haven't heard in this place before
the sound of laughter
children losing themselves in play
Innocence flooding back
79 And now we see Nineteen,
and two other  soldiers standing around a
staring at it quizzically
talking in Arabic, trying to decide what this thing is
and then
, the bravest, slings his  onto his back and carefully straddles the bouncer
pulling up his long legs and resting his feet on the pegs
And he begins to bob back and forth
holding onto the bunny's ears with his big hands
the other soldiers starting to laugh as he bobs faster
and then we see
's smile
a million watt smile on this guy
the first time he's played like this since he was a boy
- '  -  - Hours later and we see Sam pushing a couple of the smaller children on the swingset
Deng approaches
Some of the child soldiers say there is a bounty on your life
That Kony is offering money for your nose and ears
Sam, no reaction, just keeps swinging the children
(') 'd like to assign a few more men to you during the day
He ain't the first old-boy who wanted to see my head hanging on his wall
Keep yer soldiers where they're needed
can take care of myself
Deng clearly worried for his friend, but doesn't press the issue
And now Sam notices William off from the group, sitting on the ground by himself, not playing
(') He said anything yet
All we know is that his family was killed and that he and his brother were taken into the
Where's the brother
Nobody knows
Sam approaching William, kneeling down next to him
80 Hey buddy, you don't wanna play with the other kids
William, no response
(') You know sometimes it helps to tell somebody what you got locked up inside, know what  mean
William, no reaction whatsoever
Something dawning on Sam in this moment
(') You have no idea what 'm sayin, do you
William just stares back at him and Sam realizes he doesn't speak English
And they both just sit here for a moment, silent, staring at the children playing on the playground
And then Sam, feeling the need to unburden himself, begins to talk
(') done a lotta things  ain't proud of
Hurt a lotta people
Truth is, helpin you kids is about the only good thing  ever done in this life
William watching him quietly
(') But 'm scared
Scared one day 'll close my eyes to all this and make it somebody else's problem
() Just like everybody else in this world
And he stops and it's silent between them again
William just sitting there quietly
And Sam looks up to the sky
feeling his life washing over him
his burden
this fear
-  - Sam behind the wheel, driving alone the edge of a dry ravine
Deng is in the passenger seat and we see Nineteen, Marco and
crammed into the back
don't see nuthin
Deng checking a handheld  unit -- This is it
81 Sam looking out the window, sees movement at the bottom of the ravine
Hold on
and we see what he sees --  hiding behind a bush
(') got em
- And we see the  picking it's way down the rocky slope
reaching the dry riverbed below and moving closer to the children
- and the terrain becomes inaccessible and the  stops
Unable to go any further
Sam and the others getting out of the truck and we see two children hiding behind a bush 50 yards away
Sam to the kids, but they draw back
Too scared to move
Deng, tell camp we're comin back with two
, Nineteen -- go get them kids
and Nineteen move off as Sam pops the rear hatch on the  and pulls out a
- and Nineteen moving over rocks toward the children, calling out to them in Arabic -- "Come out, we won't hurt you
" -- but they don't move
and finally they reach the kids and we see it's two boys (6 years old), kneeling in the dirt, terrified
() Don't be scared
He smiles, reaches for one of the boys -- and -- --
--   hits
in the neck, killing him instantly
Nineteen dives behind a boulder for cover
- Sam, Deng, and Marco scramble behind the
moment before we hear Nineteen  offscreen
82 What's he sayin
is dead
Shit
() Tell him to stay where he is
Don't move
(yelling to Nineteen, Arabic) Don't move
Ask him if he saw the shooter
(yelling to Nineteen, Arabic) Did you see him
Nineteen responds
(') He did not see
-- and we see
's lifeless body lying by the children
and the
and then part of Sam's head peering from behind the truck -- - Sam looking through binocs as -- --
-- hitting the windshield right next to his head, and he drops behind the truck
You got `em
Yes
He's on the ridge

Can you reach the Browning
Deng opening the rear door and reaching inside the truck

The bullet hitting the , narrowly missing Deng
He slides the to Sam

Put everything you got into that rock up there
-- locked on the  when suddenly -- Deng and Marco pivot around the truck and start firing -- bullets popping all around and the sniper drops for cover as -- - -- Sam  over the rocks and dives into a shallow ditch out of sight
Deng and Marco stop firing and drop back behind the

And we realize he didn't see Sam change positions
- Sam rolling onto his stomach and slowly sliding the barrel of the rifle between two rocks
then seeing a sliver of the  hidden on the ridge
-- still locked on the , waiting for a clear shot
- Sam putting a bead on the Sniper, but at this range the shot is going to take instinct
Sam turns his head away from the rifle and exhales -- controls his breathing -- as we go -- -- trained on the
and then we see a  from the right side of the screen
and a delayed
-- Killed instantly
- Deng looking through binocs at the ridge -- (calling out to Sam) think you got him
- Sam, Deng, and Marco moving toward the children, weapons drawn, scanning the area in all directions
Deng is the first one to reach the boys who are huddled on the ground, shaking from fear
() It is ok
You can get up now
84 But the boys don't move
and Deng reaches down, pulls them to their feet and we see that their ankles are chained to a post which has been buried in the ground
(') Sam
Sam joins Deng, sees the chains
(') wanted us here
Sam realizing that these children were used as bait -- for him
- We're at the top of the ravine now and we see Sam and the others moving toward the location of the
and Sam is the first to reach the body
laying on the ground face down
a pool of blood soaking the dirt underneath
and he rolls the body onto it's back and we see it's just a kid -- no older than 15 years old
'  - '  - It's late at night and we see Sam on his cot, sitting here in the dark
And we hear the sound of his satellite phone vibrating on the table next to him
He picks it up, sees ' name on the screen
( ) Hello
-  - And we see Donnie on a couch by himself in this shitty little room
Sam, it's me
: Everybody ok
Oh yeah, everybody's just fine
was just callin to say `hey' is all
How're the girls
85 They're good
Paige cooked us all dinner the other night
Chocolate-chip pancakes
By herself, huh
Yep
helped her with the stove is all
She did everything else
Pretty good too
And now we see Donnie's   sitting on the table in front of him
He's using again
(') How's it goin over there
Goin fine
Hey, maybe 'll come with you one of these trips
'd like to get outta here for a spell
See what it's like
Sounds good
And it's silent between them
both of these men lost in their own worries for a moment
and then
Ask you a question
' Yeah
' You think God will forgive us for the things we've done
And we're watching Sam, this question hitting him like a freight train
Unable to answer
- ,  -  - We're hit by a crush of people, a thousand black faces moving past us and all the noise and confusion of this busy border town
And we find Sam, Deng, and Nineteen here loading supplies into the back of the
(
) They talk about you
Sam turning to find Agnete, the aid worker, approaching him
86 In the camps
The children
They say there is a white preacher who hunts the This place does not need more killing, Mr
Childers
'm just tryin to help these people
Same as you
War upon war does not fix what is broken here
The history of this country is filled with righteous killers
That is how it always begins, with men thinking they are killing for the right reasons
got a 200 kids who are gonna sleep safe tonight and wake up tomorrow mornin to a bowl of hot food
Right or not, that's all the reason  need
And what about the rumors  have heard about you supplying weapons to the
Sam turning to her, face-to-face, starting to get pissed
You fight the evil in this place your way, 'll fight it mine
Do not delude yourself, Mr
Childers
You're a mercenary, not a humanitarian
Sam, finished with this conversation, slams the lift-gate closed on the truck and starts to climb in
(') They say you are doing good
That you have special powers
That you are protected by angels and cannot be killed by bullets
Sam looking at her and there's a warning in what she says next
about violence corrupting men
consuming them
(') They said the same thing about Kony in the beginning
87 '  - '  - Sam sitting outside his tukul alone, tearing open an airmail package and pulling out another , slides it into his videocamera, hits play -- we see a school production
children dressed in costumes shuffling across the stage
lines being spoken by rote
and then the awkward entrance of Paige speaking her lines
but instead of finding joy in this sweet moment he finds heartache
the distance from his family
from their innocence
simply too great to bear in this moment
and then he hears giggling
and he realizes two young orphan have snuck up behind him and are looking at the screen over his shoulder
and Sam holds it up so they can see better and now more children gather around -- maybe 10 or 15 kids -- pointing at the small screen
giggling and chatting in Arabic
#1 () Look at their shoes
#2 () They look silly
#1 () This is how Americans dance
#2 () Their dancing is terrible
The children laughing hysterically
and for an instant Sam is swept out of his melancholy by their sweet enjoyment
and then Sam sees Deng and Nineteen approaching quickly
What's goin on
An  convoy has moved north over the border
They're heading for Ed Duim
That's where they sell em on the black market, ain't it
-    - moonless night
and we see headlights piercing this blackness
bouncing down a singletrack road
we are
88 '  -  - Deng behind the wheel driving -- Sam in the passenger seat -- Marco, Nineteen, and a third   jammed in the back -- Look
Far ahead we see three sets of  coming towards us on the road -- just bouncing white dots on the horizon -- and silently they begin to check their mags and weapons -- preparing for battle -- -- and the headlights get closer -- Deng not slowing down -- and we realize we are on a collision course with this convoy -- and finally we see   in the distance -- and -- ,
,
Machine gun strafe hitting the front and side of the truck -- Let's go
Sam and Nineteen leaning through the open windows as Deng drives -- leveling their 's and firing -- And now the approaching convoy   with
-- Sam and Nineteen hanging out the windows blasting back -- Deng stepping on the gas, accelerating toward the convoy like some hellish game of "chicken"(reminiscent of Sam and Donnie's wild ride with the Drifter in scene #29) -- -- and we watch as the headlights barrel towards us at full bore -- across the windshield of the truck -- --    -- headlights blown out on both trucks and now we're plunged into total blackness - - only the wild-strobe of machine gun fire lighting up the night as these trucks slam towards each other -- and finally -- Deng skidding to a stop as Sam, Nineteen, and the third pile out of the truck -- firing and advancing on the caravan by foot
-     - Rebels jumping out of their disabled trucks -- Sam and his men flanking them -- blasting one of the trucks until the engine bursts into flames -- cutting down the rebels before they even knew what hit them
And then there's a great stillness
The quiet of death
89 Sam coming out of the blackness with his  leveled
moving toward the flaming wreckage of the caravan
Deng, Nineteen, and Marco moving to each rebel body
making sure they're dead
Clear
Sam and Deng moving to the back of the Transport Truck
Bring me a flashlight
Marco hustling up with a spotlight -- Sam switching it on as Deng rips the canvas back and we see -- Boys and girls
none of them older than twelve
tied together with rope
emaciated
terrified
in very bad shape
() The front axle is broken
this truck won't drive
What'd he say
The truck is too damaged to move
(meaning the children) We don't have room for them all, Preacher
The implication of this hitting Sam, his mind reeling, turning to Nineteen
Bring our truck up here and shine them lights on us
( ) Pull everyone of them kids outta there
(to soldiers, Arabic) Bring the children out
Deng and Marco helping the children out
one-by-one
untying them
Put em right here
real easy
() Put them together here
gently
90 And now Nineteen pulls up in the , lighting up the children
(') What are you doing
We're takin the ones that ain't gonna make it through the night
Come back for the others later
And Sam moves to the first child in the group -- a little girl -- reaching out to her but she pulls back
(') Tell her 'm not gonna hurt her
() It's ok
he will not hurt you
And slowly the little girl steps forward
and Sam gently unbuttons her shirt and begins to examine her little body
turning her around in the harsh light of the 's headlamps
and he finds five infected gashes on her back
whip wounds
already turning gangrene
and he gently pushes her toward Deng
Put her in the truck
And Sam continues with the group
assessing each child's health
tenderly running his hands over their broken, starved bodies
somehow calculating which ones are worse off and pulling them out of line
and he reaches the last child and we see that the  is now with children
huddled into every available corner
10 children in total
There's no more room
(') Tell em we're comin back
Deng hesitating, knows the reaction he's going to get
(') Tell em
() We will be back for you
The children become hysterical, crying, running at Sam and grabbing for him, begging to be taken
91 Let's go
(to the children, holding up ) Two hours
'll be back in two hours
Sam, Deng, and the others loading into the
some of them climbing onto the roof
the only available space
the remaining children clamoring around the truck as it begins to pull away
(') Tell em to hide
Don't come out til they see my face
Deng yelling this to the children as they drive off
() Hide until we return
the faint cries of the children slowly fading as they speed into the darkness
'  - red sun breaking the horizon
It's    and we see the blasting through the front gate of the compound and skidding to a stop --    --      -- Betty and the other camp women already pulling the children out of the truck
ushering them into the infirmary
Sam yelling at another soldier as he walks across the courtyard -- Gas it up
We're leavin here in five
-  - Two hours into this return trip and it's silent in this cab
Deng checking a handheld , clocking their position, and then they see it -- through the windshield -- in the distance -- Rising in a thin column a half-mile away
-    - The scene of the ambush the night before
Burned out pickup trucks and dead  rebels strewn in the dirt
Sam's  arriving and he's the first one out
whistling for the children but they're nowhere to be seen
And now we realize that the column of smoke isn't coming from the bombed-out  trucks -- it's coming from behind them
Sam moving around the back of the   to see -- 92 The children Sam left behind
Burned alive by the  an hour earlier
Sam just standing here, staring at this smoldering pile of children
Starting to go someplace very dark
And as he puts it, most of him died in the bush this morning too
: -  - (/2005) And we see a line of American  waiting to be checked through customs
in their rumpled suits carrying briefcases,  with their tired children returning from vacation
and Sam standing in this line with his duffel bag, somehow cut-off from the life all around him
And the waves him forward
Sam handing him his passport
Sudan
And he looks up, studies Sam -- (') What are you doing over there
And we see Sam has no answer for him
This question beginning to plague him like a festering sore
- -   - It's raining and we see Sam sitting on a bench waiting, staring o

at a
Two men working through a pile of , heaped on top of each other like bodies, tossing them one-by- one into the back of the trolley
(
) Sam
He looking up as Donnie gets out of his car, smiling
Sorry 'm late
Sixteen was all jammed up
Donnie is strung out, but Sam is too deep in his own shit to see it
(') Welcome home, buddy
-  - ,
- at a desk, in a gray suit, shaking his head
93 understand what you're saying, but there's just not a lot we can do, until we pay down some of what you owe my hands are tied
to see Sam sitting in a chair across from him, a manila folder filled with his business papers sitting on his lap
It's just an application for a short term loan
Sam, we already took out a second on your home
It's only 90 days
You're completely leveraged
only got one truck over there, John need the money to buy a second vehicle
Sam opens a manilla folder and pulls out a photo of a truck for sale
It's important
Now, there's one in Kampala  can probably get for twenty- one
(cutting him off) Sam, we know what you're doing over there in Africa and we support it but
Sam leans over the desk and sets another photograph down in front of him -- and we see it's a gruesome photograph of a mutilated boy
want you to look at this
See that
Twelve year old boy had both his arms cut off by
An employee approaches the bank manager with something to sign, looks down at the photos
The Bank Manager becoming uncomfortable
Sam
It's not necessary
94 Sam pulls out another photograph and sets it in front of the Bank Manager -- this one even more gruesome
Look at this John, when we found this little girl her breasts had been hacked off
Bank Manager not looking at the photograph
Sam, this isn't necessary
Look at her
Look at this girl
Bank Manager glancing at the photograph then looking away
(') Now  ain't in here askin fer money fer a hot tub or vacation or somethin like that
'm askin for an extra vehicle so can save some children
You understand that
do, but
But nuthin
need you to open yer little book there and do whatever you need to do to get me that loan
Sam, You need to calm down
Don't tell me to calm down
Look at those pictures
-- Look at em, John -- And he slams the desk with his open hand, taking us to
-    -   - / on the fritz and it's blistering hot in here
150 parishioners in pews waving themselves with hand fans trying to stay cool
And we see Sam at the pulpit in mid-sermon, shirt pitted and rolled up to his elbows
The rage in this man is palpable
Open yer eyes
Wake up
() You call yerselves children of God, but you ain't
Ya'll just sheep followin him deaf, dumb, and blind
(-) () 95 (') But God don't want sheep
He wants wolves to fight his fight
Men and women with teeth to tear at the evil that's out there
The congregation whipped into a frenzy
few of them jumping to their feet, shouting praise
(') '  ' '    , ' -  - ,  - And we see John Garang in the back of this car as it drives through downtown Kampala
(
) -    -   - Sam becoming more possessed
' The congregation responding, "Amen

Garang and other getting out and making their way to a waiting
(
) -    -   - Sam, a building fury
-   - Garang and the others loading into the helicopter, locking doors
Propellers starting to rotate
96 (
) -    -   - -   - The helicopter lifting off the ground, ascending into the cloudless sky until it's just a speck in the limitless blue

) And only then will their hearts beat no more
and they will be turned to dust

Donnie flips through a magazine, Lynn puts away laundry
Chatter here about an upcoming formal
Mary Strauss and them is havin dinner at The Chimney
Who's her date
' Tony Wilks
thought Tony Wilkes was goin with Patty Hobbes' daughter
They broke up last month
And now we see Sam off from the group, absently watching the  in an adjoining room
and a   begins
a flashing on the screen
Sam moving closer to the set so he can hear -- Sudanese opposition leader John Garang has been killed in a helicopter crash according to a statement released by the Sudanese Government in Khartoum today
Sam going completely still
97 (') Garang was hailed as a peacemaker in Sudan and was instrumental in ending the 21-year civil war that has ravaged that country
(') Six of Garang's associates and seven others also died in the crash which is being blamed on bad weather
Sam frozen, shocked
just staring at the  as the newscast switches to another story
(
) Dad
-- Dad
Sam looking up to find everybody staring at him
(') What do you think about us gettin a limo for next weekend
Wouldn't be too expensive since there'd be six of us
Sam lost here for a moment
(') Hel-lo
Earth to Dad
What do you think
Honey, you ok
Heck, why don't  just drive ya'll
We ain't crammin in the back of your Caprice
Ya'll could fit in there easy
We got dresses, Donnie
We'll get all wrinkled
Plus it smells in there

Dad, what you think
Can we get a limo
98 No
Dad
Please
Patty and them is gettin one
You ain't rentin no limo to Pittsburgh
We could probably get us a deal through one of Tom Hickey's boys
Between the six of them it wouldn't cost too much
Nobody's spendin money on no friggin limousine
But dad
Sam snapping,    -- Quiet
Nobody moving
Completely still
And then
We're just talkin bout it, honey
Too much talk in this house
got mouths to feed and you're talkin bout pissing money away on a limo
It's my formal, dad
don't give a shit what it is
You ain't gettin no limo, end of story
Tears welling up in Paige's eyes, anger, hurt, wanting to lash out at him somehow
And what she says next she's felt her whole life
You love them black babies more than you love me
, 99 Sam
Donnie instinctively grabbing his arm, protective
Hey
And Sam spins -- gets in his face -- eyes dark and threatening -- What the hell you think you're doin, boy
Honey
Take it easy, buddy
Don't tell me to take it easy in my own fuckin house
Sam and Donnie toe-to-toe and the threat of serious violence here
Tension like a hair trigger
(') That ain't your wife and this ain't your family
You nuthin but a stray fuckin dog round here, boy
You don't mean that
Hell  don't
Now you get the fuck outta here fore  put yer head through that wall
Donnie standing here, hurt
looking to Lynn to make sure she's alright and she nods for him to go
and he turns and walks out
Paige bursting into tears and running out of the room
- crowded, noisy outlaw bar in Johnstown
We see Sam sitting at the bar all alone, a shot of whisky and a bottle of beer in front of him
Staring into a void
(
) You that Preacher, ain't ya
100 Sam turns to find a burly looking  standing next to him smiling
Yep, you him
seen your face in the papers few years ago
Call you the Machinegun Preacher, right
Sam nods
(') (to his buddies) Told you this is the guy
( ) Hot damn,  knew it
Papers was talkin bout how you was like some kinda African Rambo or somethin, right
You don't mind, 'd like to just sit here right now
You still helpin them niggers over there
Sam bristling
(') The way  figure it, the reason you so interested in helpin them porch monkeys is cause you probably throwin it in them nigger bitches, ain't ya
The Biker smiles a nasty, malicious smile
His buddies moving next to him now
and we see a quiet storm brewing in Sam
(') Am  right
You a nigger fucker, boy
moment here -- Sam staring at the Biker with a look we've come to know -- and -- -- Sam - the Biker's face and a sudden, violent brawl breaks out -- Bikers swinging cue sticks -- Sam wading into the crew -- swinging wild -- taking the Biker down and stomping on his face -- bloody -- murderous -- and then -- - ,  - Sam released, coming out a door and we see Lynn's car parked in the parking lot, engine idling

'  #2 - Lynn behind the wheel as Sam comes around the passenger door and gets in
And the two of them just sit here for a long beat, until
You're gonna sit there and you're gonna lemme talk
Sam says nothing
(') 've always believed in you
trusted you, trusted the Lord, and did what could so you could follow your dream
() But  ain't willin to lose you to what you're doin over there
Ain't gonna just stand by and watch you get swallowed up by it

(') know you're all them kids got, but you're all we got too
Paige needs her father
need my husband
-   -  - (/2005) Sam sitting in a chair in the dark
And we hear his cell vibrating on the desk
He picks it up and sees ' name on the screen
a moment here and then he sets the phone back down
doesn't answer it
as we go
- Donnie on a couch and he looks like hell
pale, gaunt face
phone at his ear listening to  and
and then the sound of Sam's voice
This here's Sam
You know what to do
() () Hey buddy, it's Donnie
Shoot,  was hopin' you was there
Donnie hesitating
doesn't hang-up
and we can feel how badly he needs to talk to somebody
(') Other day  was thinkin bout when you and me was kids
() 102 (') That summer we'd go down to the quarry over in Montrose, remember that
We hooked up them ropes and spent all day swimmin and jumpin off them walls
Donnie smiling to himself, a fleeting memory, and then something dark coming over him
And now we see another man here in this shitty dope house, cooking up a spoon of black tar, juicing a needle
Donnie watching him like a hawk
(') wish you was there to pray with me, buddy
-  ,
- Eastern White Pine wrapped in early morning fog
Hazy
Floating like a dream
And then the sound of
and we find Sam alone in this vapor cutting logs with an axe
Sweating despite the chill in the air
and then a voice from somewhere far off
Sam stopping, looking into the haze as a figure materializes
coming toward him calling his name
at first it looks like Donnie
but then we see it's Lynn
And when she reaches him her look tells us something terrible has happened
: -    -   - '  lying in a casket
Packed with mourners
And we hear a '  singing a plaintive hymnal
"My Jesus,  love thee"
and Donnie's mother in the first pew, dressed in black, surrounded by a few other women offering her comfort
And now we see Sam moving up the steps to the platform
and the choir softly finishes
and he looks out over the congregation
not saying a word for a long beat
and then
Most of you want me to stand up here and make some sense outta this
That's why you come here today
You want me to tell you that God has his plan for all of us, and when he wants to call us back home he's gonna do it
() That's what you wanna hear
() That's what you wanna hear
103 And Sam stops, unable to continue
just stares out at the congregation
at the expectant faces looking back at him, waiting
but he steps away from the lectern, down the steps, and walks up the aisle toward the exit
the congregation staring at him as he passes
'  #2/  -  - Hours later
Lynn and Paige still dressed from the funeral, driving up the driveway to their house
Mom, who are those men
we see a   parked next to the house and 7 or 8  pulling heavy machinery out of the barn

- Lynn getting out of the car, approaching some of the men
'cuse me, what are you doing
Loadin up
And she makes her way into

- Filled with movers busily hauling equipment out of the garage
Lynn coming in, confused
Hey, s'cuse me
And now she sees Sam going through a cabinet in the back
(') Sam, what's goin on
What are these men doin here
Sam slamming the cabinet closed, moving past her without saying a word
Lynn grabbing his arm, stopping him
(') Where are they taking our stuff
Ain't ours no more
Best go through and make sure they ain't takin nuthin that belongs in the house
104 He walks off
Sam
And she sees two men start to dismantle the "Childers Construction Company" sign that she painted herself years ago -- (') Hey
-- Don't touch that
-- -   -  ,
- Sam moving toward the house
Lynn comes out of the barn after him
( ) Sam
But he's not stopping
He reaches the house
'  - Sam coming inside, moving to the kitchen
Lynn following him
Honey,  know you're hurtin
know you're angry, but we need to talk about this
It's all done, so save yer breath
where's the keys to the safe
Sam grabs papers from the counter and hands them to Lynn
She quickly pages through them, can't believe what she's reading
You sold the business for $27,000
need a new truck for the orphanage
new truck
You sold our business for a new truck
Sam finds the Keys
(') That was our future, Sam
Paige's future
Lynn follows Sam into the office
105 (') Everything we have has gone to those children, Sam
There's a point when there ain't no more to give
What's the combination
What's the fucking combination
Paige's birthday
Sam starts to spin the combination but hesitates
(') You don't know it, do you
You don't even remember your own daughter's birthday
What are the numbers
You fight for everyone but us
She moves past him, spinning the combination and cranking open the vault
Sam grabbing a couple stacks of cash
(') You take that and we lose the house
The church
All of it
You can make it up with the ministry
What ministry
They see what you've become, Sam
They see how far gone you are
You need to get quiet with The Lord
And he looks to her
Fuck the Lord
Don't say that
Don't turn yer back on him
He turned his back on me
-- on Donnie
-- on every one of them kids over there
The good you're doin is destroyin this family
106 What good have  ever done
Sam standing here, weighing something in his mind
choice he must make here
and finally he moves past her
Please don't leave
But he's gone
: - And we see Sam moving across this crowded tarmac
Disconnected bit frightening
And he's greeted by Deng
Welcome back
But Sam says nothing, and Deng sees that his eyes are deserted
Inevitable
And Sam moves past him without saying a word
- '  - 30 or 40 adults and children here eating the last meal of the day
And we see Sam in a corner, off from the rest of the group
And maybe it's just the lighting in here, but there's a darkness around him -- literally as if the space surrounding this man is devoid of light
And we see William working his way through the room
refilling cups with hot tea
his particular job here
and he comes up to Sam and accidently sloshes some of the tea onto Sam's arm and he flinches
-- burned -- "Damn it

The entire room falls silent
Nobody moving

-- 107 The truck grinding to a halt
The driver becoming terrified, trying to jam the truck into reverse -- (') No, no, no
-- don't go back -- -- You move and they'll shoot

Agnete climbing out of the truck as we go -- -  - Rebels jumping out of the pickup truck and moving up the bridge as Agnete approaches -- holding up her hands -- It's ok -- we are a relief convoy -- Agnete and the   meet in the middle of the bridge -- (') We have only medical supplies -- non- -- And suddenly the   slams her in the gut with the butt of his rifle and she collapses
The other Rebels swarm all over the convoy, pulling out   and , forcing them onto their knees in a group

Get down

Everyone terrified -- some of them sobbing -- Agnete looking up, trying to talk to the  -- We are only a relief convoy -- Shut your mouth

and he rests the barrel of his rifle on the back of her head
he's going to shoot her -- and -- His chest
-- three bursts from behind -- the other rebels spinning toward the gunshots as -- firestorm of lead -- Sam, Deng, and the rest of his team coming onto the bridge shooting -- rebels scrambling for cover but it's too late -- dropping as they try and sprint away -- and in an instant it's all over
Agnete sees Sam, rushes toward him, but when he looks at her she freezes
He is completely unrecognizable to her in this moment -- a killer's thousand-yard stare -- barely human -- more like a machine than a man
And he moves past her down the bridge, to the   on the ground who is still alive
And he puts the barrel of his rifle against the rebel's head and
He's dead
Just like that
And he continues walking up the bridge
And we see Agnete, Deng and the other soldiers having just witnessed this
- '  - William coming in quietly, moving next to one of the captured Rebels from the previous scene who is shackled to a bed, injured
Two soldiers here standing guard
() want to ask you something
William pulls out the photograph of his brother, holds it up
(') This is my brother
His name is Christopher
He was stolen by the rebels
() Do you know if he is alive
The Rebel looks at the photograph but says nothing, just shakes his head
and he looks off, his thousand yard stare inscrutable
And William simply folds the photograph back up and slips it into his pocket
but he doesn't leave
he sits here a moment longer
quietly
thinking
and then
109 (') Were you taken when you were young like me
The Rebel hears this and turns to him
and nods his head
(') Do you remember your parents
And we see something happening in this hardened rebel
his eyes filling with a distant memory
a sadness
and slowly he nods his head again
And we stay here with these two lost souls sitting next to each other
silent
connected by a shared history and anguish

Deng approaches
Neither one acknowledging the other for a long beat until

There is no more laughter
The children do not play here anymore
They are scared once again
() But now they are scared of you
Sam, no response
(') The men do not trust you any longer to lead them into battle
They say you have a wish to die
() am worried about my friend
want to help him
don't need your help
And Sam turns away
After a beat Deng walks off, leaving him alone once again
'  - '  - And we see Sam here in the dark
moonlight filtering in through the thatched roof
like shards of glass cutting through the blackness
and he doesn't look right here
soul worn thin
eyes hollow
starting to go someplace very bad
110 babies burned and screaming
Donnie in his coffin
and we realize we're watching something here
his world starting to cave in on him
and he drops against his cot
distraught
tears in his eyes and this man is breaking
and suddenly we see a gun in his hand
finger curling around the trigger as he puts it to his head
eyes closing against the world
and
Sam frozen
still holding the gun
and slowly the door pushes open and we hear soft footsteps shuffling into this dark room
and William steps into the light, sees Sam here on the ground with the gun in his hand
and slowly he moves next to him, sitting on the cot without saying a word
just the two of them here for a moment
and then slowly he begins in perfect English
remember my parents when  sleep
see them in my dreams sometimes
Sam looking to William
this small boy sitting above him
telling his story
(') My father was big like you
They shot him
We were so scared
Then the rebels gave me a club and told me if  didn't kill my mother they would shoot my brother and me
And William pauses in his story
lost in this memory
his face becoming a mask of pain
but no tears
there are no more tears in this young man left to be shed
and so he continues
(') refused, but my mother told me to swing hard
that  must make her proud
() And so  did
made her proud
And now William looks down at Sam
staring at this man on the ground
and he reaches out and gently touches Sam's head
a moment of tenderness for both of them
an act of love
these two broken souls finding each another here
and William says
(') If we allow ourselves to become full of hate then they've won
We must not let them take our hearts
This is the most important thing
111 And Sam sets the gun down and reaches out to William, pulls him into an embrace
holding him close
and we know that without a doubt this boy has saved this man's life
'   -  ,
- Soft Christian music is playing on the radio
Lynn folding clothes in the laundry room when the phone rings
Paige comes into the upstairs hallway and answers it
(quiet, into phone) Hello
'  - '  - Sam on his sat phone -- Bug
You there
'  -  ,
- Dad
Yeah, it's me
You ok
'm ok, Bug
And there's a long pause
so much to say but no words to say it
each of them holding their phones to their ears and just listening
and finally Sam says
(') 'm thinkin of a tree
And we see tears well up in Paige's eyes when she hears this
and now we see Lynn coming around the corner, overhearing them as they begin their little game one more time
You said tree
'm thinkin of a knee
Sam smiling to himself
and we realize this man is coming back to life when he says
You said knee, 'm thinkin of bee
() love you, Bug
112 love you too, Daddy
Lynn hearing this and tears roll down her cheeks as we go
- '   - And we see the soldiers at their posts
Betty and the other Camp Women cleaning clothes and preparing food
and we see most of the children loitering around a tree in the shade, sullen, not playing on the playground
And then we see Sam coming into the courtyard kicking a soccer ball
some of the children see him and point
and slowly the entire camp begins to notice Sam kicking the soccer ball awkwardly by himself out in the open
Betty and the other women stopping their chores and watching him, speaking to one another in Arabic
Deng and the other soldiers staring as Sam pops the ball into the air and bounces it off his head
and now a couple of the smaller kids sprint for him and he kicks them the ball
and slowly the rest of the children join in the fun
kicking the ball back and forth
an impromptu soccer game
and then we hear  again
joy flooding back into this place
Deng watching with a big smile as this white man dances around these little children
a Pied Piper of joy
playing in the dirt
- '   -  - And we see William approach a knot of soldiers standing by the front gate smoking cigarettes
Excuse me
#3 What is it
Is it true an  commander was captured last night
Soldiers nodding their heads "yes
" (') Where is he being held
#3 At the army base in Kisoro
Are you going there
113 #3 Yes
Can  ride with you
#3 Why do you want to go to Kisoro
want to ask the commander something
#3 No, you cannot ride with us
Wait till tomorrow and go with the women on the bus
And the soldiers turn their backs on William and he slinks away
- '  - We see a line of women along the riverbank in their colorful dresses
scrubbing pans and washing clothes
singing an ancient African spiritual as they work
the sun dropping pale red on the horizon
And we see Sam here too
alone with himself
sitting at the river's edge, watching the water rolling gently past
listening to the soft serenade of the women
the beauty of it all
and then he gets up and walks into the river
and he kneels down so that water reaches his waist (reminiscent of his first baptism in scene #35)
and now the women on the riverbank stop their work, watching him as he closes his eyes and gently leans back
submitting to the water
and when he comes up again we see in his eyes that his soul has been saved in this simple act
And the women begin to shout their praise from the riverbank as we go
- '   - And we see William here alone, pulling out a small satchel
filling it with a bottle of water and a blanket
- '   - William at the edge of the compound
looking over his shoulder to make sure nobody is watching him
and then quickly slipping under the fence and he's gone
- William walking through the dry scrub alone
already a couple miles deep in the bush
the sun starting to set
light waning
William starting to get nervous, picking up his pace
114 squad of  rebels coming through the scrub
William hiding under a bush, terrified
the men coming closer
no idea if they saw him or not
his mind racing
voices getting louder
starting to hyper-ventilate from the fear -- and -- Sprinting through the bush -- running for his life -- rebels see him -- yelling for him to stop -- chasing him down -- shooting their rifles into the air and he hits the ground in the fetal position -- too terrified to continue -- eyes clamped shut as 4 or 5 rebels surround him -- guns pointed at his head -- caught
- '  - Sam coming into the building, finding Betty tending to a sick child
Have you seen William
Betty shaking her head "no", and we see the worry on Sam's face
intuitively knows something is wrong
-  - William bound and gagged being dragged through the bush by 5 or 6 rebels
and one of the rebels sees him staring at them and he brings the butt of his Kalishnikov down hard -- striking William on the head as we go -- - '  - Deng coming up to Sam
Some of the soldiers said he was asking about the commander that is being held at Kismoro
Sam closing his eyes, knows instantly what William has done
Get em on the phone, see if he's shown up at the base yet
-     - William shoved through the bush
moving deeper into this rebel encampment
dark and otherworldly
figures moving around camp fires
laughing
men with little girls
their child wives
with pregnant bellies
and incongruously the sound of American rap music coming from a jambox somewhere
The overriding sense we get from this place is one of `insanity
' 115 And William is dragged to a clearing next to a grouping of tents and he's kicked to the dirt
two other soldiers pinning him to the ground as a third grabs his feet and pulls off his shoes
William and now a handful of other  soldiers start to gather around
most of them only a few years older than him
watching as his ankles are bound together and placed on a wooden block
and now another soldier steps forward with an
and the crowd whips into bloodlust
shouting
cheering
-- '   -- --  -- (
) () Stop
The soldier freezes -- everyone turning as an   comes through the crowd -- takes the axe from the soldier -- He ran from us
He is worth nothing with no feet
Put him with the others until tomorrow
- '   - Deng hustling up to Sam
shaking his head
They have not see the boy
Ok
Get Nineteen and Marco -- we're gonna go look for him
-     - And we see William in a bamboo cell in the center of camp
and we see other children here
in various stages of fear and suffering
some of them completely naked
shivering in the cool air
others catatonic, probably doped up or too battered to move
-  - Sam, Deng, Nineteen and Marco in this lead truck
been out here for hours
behind them we see the second camp truck following
And they come to a fork in the road, pulling to a stop
116 It will be light soon
What do you want to do
Sam looking at a topo map on his lap
Let's go through Maridi, see if they've seen anything
-     - Pale yellow sun breaking and we see William and a line of 10 or 12 other children -- shackled in iron -- being loaded into the back of a
- Both 's parked off the side of the road now
Sam and Deng here, looking at maps and the  tracker
And we hear Deng's radio squawk
He digs it out, responds in Arabic, then turns to Sam
The village outside of Akot says an caravan came through there an hour ago
They were headed for Ed Duim
/
-  / -    - convoy of 4 or 5  trucks barreling down this dirt track
And we see lots of rebels standing up in the back of these trucks, cradling heavy weapons, alert -- and suddenly we see in the distance -- - From different angles -- converging on the  convoy -- the Rebels see them and point -- they know what's coming and they begin to prepare for war -- - Getting closer -- and then we see them -- ' Bouncing over the terrain towards us -- coming fast -- and then -- An  streaks toward the lead  truck and --
-- the truck is blown off it's axles -- the other  trucks pulling off the road -- and suddenly we're in a withering firefight -- the roar of heavy weapons at full-tilt
117 Jumping out of their trucks and flanking the  convoy -- triangulating fire -- shredding the rebels -- blowing them back off their feet
Sprinting through the bush -- edging around the  trucks -- finding a position on their weak side and locking an  into a launcher -- shouldering it -- aiming --
-- the missile streaking toward the second  jeep and -- It's blasted into the air -- onto it's side -- rebels scurrying away from the wreckage -- still firing -- an absolute hail of lead -- 's barking in every direction -- One of the rebels standing up -- firing an  --
crouched behind the new orphanage truck firing -- sees the white streak coming at him -- dives -- just as -- moving closer to the rebels -- shooting -- picking them off one by one -- gunfire raking over his head -- a dozen muzzle flashes coming from everywhere -- Sam yelling over the thunder -- Go
-- Go
-- Go
-- Go
And we see Deng coming out of the bush to his right -- and then Nineteen to his left -- and they charge on the remaining rebels -- Sam providing covering fire -- a curtain of lead cutting through the enemy -- and just like that it's over -- Sam waving behind him -- (') Cease fire
-- and suddenly there's just a sick silence -- smoke rising from the shot-to-shit  trucks -- bodies strewn in the dirt -- the brand new orphanage truck bombed out and smoking on it's side
And Sam makes his way to the first   -- Deng covering him as he rips the canvas back to see -- 50 (') Pull em all out
'mon, let's go
(to Soldiers, Arabic) Take them out
118 Soldiers start to unload the children -- Cut them loose
(to soldier, Arabic) Cut the ropes
Sam moves to the second  , rips the canvas back to -- 50 Holy fuck indeed
He's been here before
100 kids and he only has one good vehicle
and we watch him standing here
staring at these tiny faces looking back at him
a moment
lost in indecision until one of the kids stands up near the back
' Sam sees him and suddenly he knows exactly what he needs to do
', '
get em out of there and line em up
-- '
-- And we've seen this before
Sam going through these children
assessing their health
one by one
separating the worse off from the others
forming two group
turning to Deng and Nineteen and motioning to the smaller group (about 15 children)
(') Load these here into the truck
Put em three deep if you have to
Deng herding the children toward the one good truck
(') (turning to Marco, Arabic) Come with me -- Sam and Marco moving from one dead  rebel to the other
rolling them onto their backs
going through their belts
pulling out extra ammo clips and grenades
(') Get them 's too
() The machine guns
Marco swinging four or five machine guns onto his shoulder
119 At the , now jammed with children
Sam talking to Nineteen, Marco and the others
(') need all you to climb up on that roof and keep yer eyes peeled
That road back might be hot, so be ready
What about you, Preacher
(
) We're staying
Sam turns to see Deng next to him, holding an  in his hands, a steely resolve in his eyes
Sam nods, emboldened by his support
(to the soldiers) Go on
Get outta here
The soldiers load onto the  and drive off, leaving Sam and Deng standing here in the middle of these 85 children
Waiting for the war that will surely come
-  - And we stay in this truck as it pulls away
driving for a long time
until Sam, Deng, and the children become only specks on the horizon
and then
-- "To this day, Sam Childers fights for the children of Sudan and Northern Uganda
" 120 : Joseph Kony and his Lord's Resistance Army continue their reign of terror in Sudan and Northern Uganda
Amnesty International estimates that Kony and the  are responsible for over 400,000 murders and more than 40,000 child abductions
These children are tortured, raped, sold into sex slavery, and forced to take part in ritualized killing by commanders
The Islamic Government of Sudan continues to provide weapons and safe haven to Kony and the  as part of a deal to wage a proxy war against the predominately Christian South
Without pressure from the United States, this support will continue and more innocent children will be slaughtered
Now you know
121 As of 2011, Sam Childers has rescued over 800 children from the
His `Angels of East Africa Orphanage' is home to more than 300 orphans, and feeds over 1200 meals a day to neighboring villagers in need
