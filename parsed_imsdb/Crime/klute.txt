There are joyous sounds of celebration
The around the table revealing the happy family and guests
Among them are  and
Camera stops at Mrs
Grunemann who sits at the foot of the table opposite her husband
She smiles across at him with pleasure
We cut to Tom Grunemann smiling back at her
We cut back to a closeup of Mrs
Grunemann  looking back at her husband with love
We cut back to Tom Grunemann's chair - only now it is empty
The joyous sounds disappear on this cut
It appears that Tom Grunemann has disappeared before our eyes
One moment he is there, and the next moment he is gone
The camera pans back down the table, only now it is empty except for Grunemann's children and Mrs
Grunemann
She is now dressed in something dark
She and the three children sit eating another meal in emptiness
She has changed from a joyous woman to a woman bereaved
:   - The industrial frontier
steps into frame, glancing (perhaps idly, a little impatiently) in this direction at some loud industrial goings-on just beyond camera, then returns toward
The group includes  and a with clipboard, to whom  is supplying preliminary data
's manner is somewhat rumpled, awkward
Klute
With a
-  -  - Are you with plant security, Sergeant
(shakes head) Town Police
Then how are you involved
(slowly) know Tom Grunemann
(shortcutting again) You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann
How well
We grew up together
Kids
Can you account for his disappearance in any way
No
Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed
(aside to younger Agent, recording) -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here
Indicates no
Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities
-- No
Marital problems in general
Indicates possibly -- am  right Sergeant
Everybody's got some,  guess
Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York
No
Examine this letter please
(continues) We recovered that from the shredder -- the plant disposal and incinerator system
Grunemann apparently typed it Friday, before he left, decided not to send it, tossed it away
We've already contacted the New York Police; they think they know the girl in question
Klute reads
We see a controlled incredulity and revulsion
(') He never mentioned this type thing to you
You didn't know he had these interests
:
- thrusts the letter back toward camera, toward crying out - My husband was not like that
My God, Klute
It looks like he sent her quite a few of those Holly -- the girl -- she recalls six or seven letters like -- (calmly) -- No
mean sure a little rough stuff, but just what people usually -- No,  would've said we were pretty good
(pause) Johnnie  don't understand
just don't understand
Klute nods
She is talking for both of them
Klute looks out the window to the children playing outside
out window to Klute's  of children playing on a cold winter day
The trees are stripped bare
Tree lined area, lush and green - Summer
: '  - pulls back inside window to Klute staring outside, as if still pondering the fate of Tom Grunemann
The group in the office includes (holding a report), , a New York detective, Cable, and the plant director,
-- has disclosed no evidence of crime or criminal intent within the jurisdiction of this bureau, and since subject Thom -- (turns sharply, interrupts) It's been almost a year
Tom Grunemann's been missing for a year
And all the  has to offer is a report that must bore even you
(restraint) Well sir
Are you closing the case
No sir, we don't state that
We're countin -- But you don't find it worth much effort
(injured dignity) Well Mr
Cable, you've got me here from the Bureau
You got Lieutenant Trask here from New York representing his department and don't frankly consider -- (moderating, suggesting) Why couldn't you ever find out anything from the girl
(refers the question) Trask -- (summarizes from notes) We first hold her under surveillance expectin your boy Grunemann to show up there
Didn't
Then we bagged -- we arrested her on a  charge, convicted, two month's women's city prison, offer to reduce sentence, she cooperated
(counts) Four interrogations
She thought she remembered Grunemann -- from those letters from before, she made that connection -- but she hadn't seen him since and couldn't identify his photograph and she -- Why not
Oh a good call girl, she'll turn six-seven hundred tricks a year
The faces get blurred
(resumes) And since then, recent months, she's reported several, you know, incidents: like breather calls, anonymous phone calls, also somebody maybe following her, watching her, things like that
So it's  guess you could say, conceivable Grunemann's still around there, just hangin around her, spooking her
But you know, that -- He shakes his head, gestures doubtingly
Ross caps it
The subject got emotionallv disturbed; he just dropped out
There's thousands
Inspector we understand your position; ours is a little different
We have an investment in Tom Grunemann
The Company has an investment, and we feel entitled to investigate for ourselves
Private investigation, you mean
Yes sir, of course you're entitled, and there's some very competent -- Klute offered us his services; we've accepted
Pause
Ross and Trask look at Klute - more than a bit startled - then at each other
Klute just looks uneasy
(') Klute knew Tom
He has a great many ideas about the case -- (sourly) Yes sir, we know he -- We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you
He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and -- (tactfully) Mr
Streiger, speaking frankly -- we've appreciated the Sergeant's interest you know, all along
Here, locally
But New York, that's - well -- (to Klute, leniently) Ever done any missing person's work
Spent much time in the city
(to others) You see,  have to wonder -- speaking frankly; the Sergeant knows 'm only speaking frankly - You wonder why we thought of Klute
Frankly
He's interested

:   - Verdant Pennsylvania farmland
Early morning
Near at hand an open field set about with bee hutches and patched with mist
, a shadow (Klute's actually) moves across frame from the left, blanking in
We reorient to - -   - We see that we've been looking out from the bedroom window of this house
Klute turns to rolltop desk in bedroom and picture of Tom Grunemann, picture of Bree Daniel, and other material he has collected on the case
He puts them in his suitcase and closes the suitcase
He shuts rolltop desk
'  - We follow Klute through the house with suitcase
He puts away a last dish, shutting off water, gas, and electricity, and so on -- takes a last look around - reaches for the door handle
-- -   - section of wall, a door coming open -- and the of  entering and standing
We have gone from the warm sunlight of the country to mustv darkness
She appears chic, poised, and perfect as a magazine picture
But as she gets used to the darkness and her eyes focus on a line of equally beautiful girls sitting and waiting in folding chairs along a wall, we see that she is a great deal less certain of demeanor
Assailable
- ' , ,  - Klute, stepping out, closes, locks and checks the house door, then moves on to his car -- a vintage Plymouth -- and tosses in his suitcase; and then takes a last turn around the yard itself; props open the cover of a beehutch, and lets down the rail gate of a sidefield
He approaches to roll shut his barn door -- and on this action we again  -- -  - (
) (hastily) Honey, no, we don't have too many
She slaps the cup down, hurls herself forward -- -- onto a  , thrusting him down to the floor, her hands at his throat
As we , and as the Director reads from script, supplying a narrator voice - (') Now before it comes to that, let's have a look, et cetera, et cetera -- - Bree and the Male Actor relax slightly, as - , We reestablish the scene -- a few pieces of film equipment -- and the congery of other  and preparing to read for parts
As the Director approaches, counsels Bree -- all of this quick and consecutive -- (') -- Honey you make it look a little real
It should have, you know, that fun to it
(beat) Strangle him to death funny
Well we go from this into stomach diagrams
It can't be too -- look let's try it again from - -- but then he glances at his watch, and at the others waiting their turn
(') No -- just give us the faces at the end, would you
Bree and the Male Actor set their cheeks together, beaming half-moon smiles to camera, hold it for a moment, as the Director reads again - (') (reads) -- And another family saved by Elso tablets
-- (brightly) Thank you very much
-- and holds out his hands for their scripts, at the same time as he summons from a list in his other hand -- (') Pierce -- Danner - passes a new group of beautiful girls sitting in line waiting their turn as she exits as brightly as possible
:  - They trudge along the sidewalk -- the herd, the late-afternoon crush
- shot, the crowd compacted
We see  milling along with the rest
She maneuvers to a sidewalk  , enters
We see her deposit, dial
,  - She is connected (to her registry)
Bree Daniel, any messages
(waits -- none) , thanks
She waits for a moment
Then makes a curious, small gesture of her hand -- deposits another dime, dials again, is answered
(') Trina
Bree
Do
Oh no, just a commercial  thought  might get, that's all
(quickly, more brightly) Well 'd take a quick thirty, hon
Do you have a commuter for me
Wait
As she prepares to write it down, we    - ' :  - Klute finishes rolling shut, and padlocks, the barn door
He returns to his car, sits in (leaving door open) starts engine
Again -- one last time -- the look around
Then he pulls the door shut, pulls out
And on this we   -- - -- middle-aged Couple, Child, Bellman with suitcases -- wait to descend in elevator as gets off
We  with her along corridor to a door
She checks number and knocks
: opens the door
We neither see or hear him clearly -- he is foreground, defocused
His shirt is untucked
Bree cocks her head, greets him cutely
Hullo
He mumbles some kind of greeting, steps back
She pauses a moment in the door (casing, instantly) -- then quite confident, friendly, provocative all at once -- (') Ooh,  knew 'd like you
-- and   -- :   - Klute's car draws through the business section of town, moves on -- :  - (the Man out of frame and unheard-from) as she bargains gaily -- and at the same time a little watchfully
Lover, that's got to be a little extra
mean it sounds very exciting, what you speak of, you've got me all excited
But something special like that, you know it's got to cost a little more, mm
-- and   -- :   - Klute has laid his jacket aside, rolled his sleeves, is eating the last of a vending machine sandwich
The   is on
He leans forward, tuning it from -- 1ST ' (energetic) -- -  - , radio's voice is the Shippensburg Valley, on a beautiful clear warm Thurs -- -- to -- 2ND ' (rural) -- Tucky Wonder Beans picking up a half cent over yesterday's price at- -- and   -- ,  ( ) - The Man's face is buried against her neck, her labors over her
She cries out ecstatically, transportedly -- it would seem at the edge of orgasm -- Oh lover, oh it's too much -- oh you thrill me -- yes, like that, it's -- oh it's beautiful, oh -- -- and at the same time refers privately to her wristwatch
And   -- :     - - ' As Klute's car drives onto the turnpike surrounded by green country, we  into a close shot of Klute through the windshield of his car
And then in what seems like a continuous shot we  back to a wide angle revealing Klute caught in the endless line of cars in a typical traffic jam at the entrance to New York City, surrounded by smoggy, grey, urban skies
- ' - sits inside his car as it is mechanically lifted into the air
It looks as if he is being manipulated by a robot
:    - moves along street, returning home, apprehensive of the one or two other distant She turns in at one of the Brownstones
- We watch Bree as she mounts to the top floor, the door of her apartment, barren, isolated, frightened
'  - unlocks the door, switches on a light, cases the apartment for a moment before entering, securing chain-lock, putting aside her things
There is a   near the first interior doorway
She switches it as she moves by
By time the first record has dropped, she has the shower turned on, is getting rid of her dress
We -- :  - Klute walks, as before, carrying his suitcase
We see him slow, concernedly looking toward -- ' :   - Bree sits on a studio couch, near the record player, with a  huddled over and around her, her back against the wall
The  is classical, curiously -- the sound of a
She is more or less expressionless -- but trembling violently, shaking
" " -  -  , 's :  - Bree moves about energetically, preparing to set out on rounds
on the door
She startled, then approaches to door, to peep-hole, lifts lid aside
Klute's face is somewhat distorted by the peephole lens; he is gazing mildly about the landing
(through door, curtly) What is it
(
) Miss Daniel
My name is Klute -- John Klute -- She turns the door handle , parts the door about three inches, looks through at him
He starts to enter
(') Can  talk to you
-- and the door crunches against its chain-lock
He stops perforce, a bit startled
pause
slice of Bree's face looks coldly out at him
He summons a smile
What about
My name's John Klute
You said that
'm an investigator
'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann
She tightens again
Who
Tom Grunemann
He wrote you some letters
(innocently) Gee
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania
He disappeared from there last April
've been hired to look for him
Why
You know what 'm talking about
Miss Daniel
Honest
Will you let me ask you some questions
(gumbo-southern) Dew yew hayuv ah-dentifikyshun
He takes out a folded letter and a wallet and passes them both through to her
Silence
She examines them with care, then appears to soften a little; even smiles slightly
(') You're not police or ; you're just a private investigator
Mm
And you just want to ask me a few questions
Mm
She smiles again, hands the letter and wallet back out, closes the door (doesn't slam, just closes)
Klute looks at it blankly for a time, starts to knock again, decides not to -- turns and descends the stairs
Bree listens through the door to his departing foot steps
They fade from hearing
She hastens to assemble her properties
- Klute comes out door and descends the stairs at the same even pace -- he walks into the vacant store below
- It had once been a Boutique that sold happy clothes
There are some psychedelic posters and a few remnants of its former identity
Klute's suitcase is propped open on a cot behind a counter
The ceilings are low, forcing Klute to stoop as he enters
He seems out of place and out of scale case containing a tape recorder stands on the floor
On the table are a  of Klute's notes, and a paper bag
Klute enters and deliberately resumes his settling in
From the paper bag he sets aside an electric , then lifts out from the shopping bag a cheap tin   and begins winding it
'  - Bree has shifted position to a window, is looking down at the street
She sees - and we hear - , distantly
She grabs her properties, whips out the door
- Bree skids to a stop just inside the door, scans quickly out in one direction then the other (in case Klute has been waiting in ambush on the sidewalk) then races --  -- to    -- makes it, pulls herself aboard -- ' :  - Klute has been watching from his window
We hear the
He turns back, plugs in the electric fan
Then hoists the  , unsnaps the cover
We see clearly what it is
- is showing her notebook to an
He leans forward courteously, occasionally stroking his forehead with his fingertips -- a nice man with a headache
-- and  take acting classes with Lee Tainter -- -- Lee, yes -- -- and  was in two of his workshop type productions, Uncle Vanya and the girl in Five Characters -- (indicates picture) -- here -- and then of course have the modeling and the demonstrator work, the trade-fair work -- but naturally  feel ready for something more, well you know, sustain -- Well, thanks very much for coming in
She starts for the door -- he's already turning away -- then ducks back, hands him one of her Glossies, laughing prettily at her own forgetfulness
(beautifully -- the business) Thank you very much
- comes out, pauses with notebook to cross out, the call completed, checks the list of those remaining, sets forth again
We hear ' , very quick, very clipped
(
) Man, just a poor pretty little hooker, like to be an actress -- - photograph of dead man
It is replaced with series of photgraphs of dead men
pulls back to reveal  flipping through the file of the unidentified dead
(
) What you lookin' to get from her
You think she's got Grunemann hid somewhere, the attic, feedin him soup
Or maybe he's hidin in a dark alley and he'll jump on her and you jump on him
And third place, even if she does know somethin' she's right, she don't have to talk to you
You don't have police power, you can't make her
closes the file
That's a lot of people to die unknown
Unknown, unidentified and unwanted
And there's more every day man, there's more everyday
As  slowly walks away we bring in and  ,  answering
Bree Daniel
(then) Yeah, hi hon
- Camera is looking up through lighted window outside at  on phone
Oh hon,  just don't know
'm trying to stay out of it
- pans down from 's window to 's window at the bottom revealing  at tape recorder
The   is going, its light winking
holds headset against one ear, makes a note or two
We hear 's and other ' , ,
' -- comes in with these other yulds maybe two or three times a year, and five big ones baby, just one evening
Marta, thanks, and 'd love to party with you hon, but -- Klute sets down the headset (we drop the  far under, ), makes a note, and thumbs open the box of a fresh reel; the present reel is near the end
We establish a pile of We    -- :    - Well try to get someone else Marty and if  change my mind -- sure hon, bye
She hangs up, starts away
The
She tries to ignore it
It persists
She finally turns back to answer it, and we   -- -   - on huge photo montage of the Family of Man and pans down to a group of beautiful girls sitting on a bench below
They are dwarfed by the enormous picture
Each one clutches an almost identical portfolio of pictures in her lap
Camera pans down row of portfolios until it stops at - impatiently waiting her turn ,
The ' is thick with drink, and emotion
First the click, then -- Bree Daniel -- ' Oh God baby, oh God  really love you
That's nice; who is this
' really love you baby, you know that
, and the '  , trailing into helpless sobs -- '  (') Hello
Hello
Oh my God, hello
: Bree comes out from the building (note possible costume change; not necessarily consecutive action), checks off on her list continues on her way -- as we
Starting with a  and -- Bree Daniel
2ND ' (nicely) Bree -- Frank Hanley, you remember, Fayetterville
Oh yeah, hi Frank, sure
2ND ' Well 'm in town, like to see you
Well Frank that's awful nice but 'm out of action, sort of, you know -- We      , , as -- -- and we     , at corner, unseen by her and apparently in surveillance of her
Then he too turns out of frame, and we   -- - is looking down at an enormous gift package on a platform
There is a sound of a recorded fanfare and with the pull of a string the package is opened revealing a brand new People applaud and the car starts to revolve
At the wheel of the car sits
We to a shot through the windshield of car -- ' sea of staring faces revolves around her
We cross fade with    (as if recalling a case record)
(
) Bree Daniel, Caucasian, twenty eight, good physical health, no narcotics record, presenting an unusually strong personality some ways, high intelligence, a high bracket call girl
'   - , a prison psychiatrist, sits on a bench eating a sandwich partially wrapped in wax paper and sipping from a carton of milk
He is obviously a man pressed for time
sits beside him
Across from them some prisoners are taking their exercise
Through the metallic netting that surrounds them, we see the skyline of New York City
It only dramatizes more the sense of being caged
-- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year
(notes Klute's reaction) Oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps
Why
(stabs at record) Why do you want to know all this
want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it
Not unusual
Did she talk about him to you
About his letters -- that's all she remembered
Quite violent material, 'd say, obsessive, a quite sick man
But that's not unusual either
Has she talked with you since prison
No
She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career
think she's trying that
Oh sure they try
The idea of a better life
But they don't really know much about life: They get confused -- or scared or frustrated or bored -- they pop back to the one thing they can handle
The trick
The trick
Men in bed
Not men in general, not life, not love, not even real sex -- it avoids all that
Just the trick, the transaction
- world revolving around  through windshield of car
The circular motion slows down and then stops
Cut to  getting out of car and walking off platform
She looks a bit shaky
She is stopped by one of the spectators
(tapping her) We had a bet on - if you were real or not
won
She looks at him in disgust and crosses to phone booth
- (on phone) Marta -- - We are in the interior of what was once a church and is now a discotheque
Interior is painted purple; the record player stands on the altar over the crowd
Pews are massed around the dance floor
Stained glass windows are lighted from behind and are circled with light bulbs that flash on and off
For all of its obviously bizarre visual quality, there is a sense of relaxation
It is a late night gathering place of many who belong to the sexual underworld of the city
and the   advance to a pew sitting there (the other girl's pimp) with a 's companion greet him shyly, tenderly: she and  sit down, join in conversation
-- other pews, other girls and a few men, the sisterhood -- To -- ( ) Among the people around the bar, pimps, whores, and a sprinkling of hopeful Johns and curiosity seekers
The camera picks a familiar face:
He watches  with a mixture of amusement and contempt
comes over to him and tries to proposition him
They appear to be discussing price
Just as she thinks it is set, he walks away
'  - photograph of   pinned to a large piece of beaverboard  has placed on a wall
over various pictures and pieces of evidence  has pinned up in an attempt to make some sense from the puzzle of  's disappearance
over to  sitting on cot looking up at the pieces of the puzzle
There is a heated  dinner in front of him
The   reels start turning (sound powered), the recording light starts winding (as , above, dials)
pays it scant attention - he can catch up with the news anytime
He sits manfully in front of the  dinner, starts peeling back the foil -- ' :  - She holds the phone, is answered
Her voice more natural, a little shy, a little covert
Hi
Bree
(is greeted) Hi
Well  could come over tonight - if you'd like -- if there's no one else
(laughs diffidently) really want to just talk to you
' :  - The tape-recorder continues turning and winking as the conversation upstairs continues
looks at dinner
He reaches for the headset of the taperecorder, holds it loosely against one ear
He exhibits a measure of new interest
The stops running
He immediately rewinds, and starts listening through it again
We   -- - Large, dark buildings -- a - showing at an upper floor of one -- the street otherwise by and large deserted
draws in, a (Bree) gets out, approaches the building, glances around, either secretly or apprehensively -- presses a buzzer, waits, gets answering , enters the dark hallway of the building, starts upstairs
- shifts into view, looking in the direction Bree's gone, a little puzzled all in all
He doesn't immediately follow; he waits
-   - We look past   , as  arrives up the dark stairway into dark rooms -- the scene, mysterious, a little sinister
She seems fearful of it herself, advances slowly, looking around, calls Hi
-_ , Mr
Faber is  for a moment, standing, watching her, from along an alleyway of garments
She sees him, is startled then relieved
(') Oh -- He moves toward her
, Mr
Faber is a man of 65 or so, rather handsome, and for this occasion very spruce, very erect, very nattily turned out
Bree complains cheerfully
(') You scared me, Mr
Faber
He smiles, kisses her cheek, tests the fabric of her evening dress -- (in passing, as a matter of expertise)
Good material, not too good cut
'd do better for you
Then he turns, lifts down a '  , carrying it -- graciously gestures her to precede him -- dim pool of light here
private area here, sectioned off by rows of garments
couch, rug, coffee table, a chair or two -- a place for Buyers to take their ease
and
enter
Her manner is suddenly elegant, assured, regal; his befits a man of the world
He fits the cloak around her shoulders and gestures to the couch; she sits
He pours a glass of wine for her, for himself
She speaks with a neat continental accent -- doing it fairly well, really -- a member of the international set
Oh thank you
He sits in the chair opposite, sips his wine
Enjoy
(then) Well -- (diffident) It's good to see you
Well -- could we do it first and then just talk
Sure dear, yes
Well -- well 'm just back
And -- must tell you -- something quite wonderful
(intently) Yes
And Cannes was quite fun, quite; and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little Italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me -- but a young man can be so silly -- Mm
And then one night -- at the gaming tables -- well  just saw him stranger -- looking at me -- and knew suddenly that all my life 'd been -- She hesitates strangely, her fingers at the neck of the cape
Faintly -- (') -- May
It's so -- (quickly) Please -- She stands, unloosing the cloak, letting it fall on the couch
But she doesn't sit again -- begins to move here and there about the enclosure, her hands wandering about her dress and body -- an erotic restlessness
Not young; he wasn't young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you
(tensely) Yes
And nobody could tell me who he was -- an exiled prince or a mercenary or a bullfighter or -- but  felt it stirring inside me, this -- this wild, pagan feeling -- - arrives from across the street
It takes him a while (with a 'loid' probably) to slip the lock
He eases door open, moves inside -- :  - is farther along in her narrative, more fervent in manner
sits at the edge of his seat, ducking his head now and then in pleasure, but making no move to molest her
And next day at the beach -- our beach pavilion --  saw him again, his eyes burning into me
was helpless
Without his even speaking to me, without his even touching, knew that somehow -- somehow -- She casts away an accessory garment
Mr
Faber burns her with his eyes -- -   - mounts into view at the head of the stairs, prowls along the aisles of clothing, looking -- sees -- Klute sees Mr
Faber first -- clearly a senior citizen -- sitting transfixed, fastened in some private dream
Then  drifts into view -- stands -- lets fall the evening dress about her ankles, poses -- drifts out of view again -- Klute watches in that direction a moment longer
In his expression a certain curiosity -- a prurience -- but rather more strongly, disappointment, a measure of disgust
Not his affair
He turns away from it, into camera, and -- '  - Near the entrance, outside the door to 's apartment below
We open on
She shouts angrily, miserably -- Whyn't you just cut out
We
Now she begins to get it
He turns, opens door to his room below
She comes slowly down steps
'  - She steps in the door, looks slowly around at his various appurtenances -- the bed, the necktie over the mirror, etc
-- and then, the   and then the
Softly, venomously -- Oh you bastard
But then she adjusts -- a frightened but matter-of fact hooker -- (') Is it the shakedown hon
You picked a loser,  just don't have it
No, 'm look -- (vehemently again) If  was taking calls full time would  be living in this kip
'd be back on Park Avenue;  could support the whole National Guard
(gestures upward) Could  ask some questions
Or you'll get me shoved back in the brig you mean; another month with the bull-dykes
She seems to have expressed it; the balance of power
She turns, goes out, heads upstairs
Klute unhurriedly takes up his folder of notes, then follows
'  - Bree disposes her belongings
Klute moves to table
There is a group of plants on the table that long since died of neglect
He notices them and the disorganization of the room without comment, opens his folder, rummages for the photographs
Then, exasperatedly -- Look,  told the police everything: don't even remember the schlub
Klute doesn't respond
Klute sets out a photograph for her to look at
: , They showed me that one understand it's Grunemann, but told them,  just don't remember
Klute tosses down a second photograph
: Tom Grunemann, Elaine Grunemann, two daughters
, (cool) family sort of man
Klute grunts, meaning 'yes'
She echoes his grunt, meaning we don't know what
He tosses another -- :   - An everybody-over-here, fellow-employees, sort of picture
(Including the figures of Streiger and Cable among many others, male and female
) The usual impedimenta -- picnic baskets, balls, bats, a held sign: 'Tole-American'
' indicates -- (
) -- Tom, again
, She looks at the picture briefly, at him questioningly
Company outing or picnic or something like that
Isn't that sweet
(then) Well it could be any one of them bubi;  get to see them all
She separates from Klute, around the table (but remains standing, restless)
Klute puts photo aside, prepares to take notes, as she pleads -- (') Look -- please -- will you just try to get it from my side
year ago
was in the life fulltime
was living on Park with leather furniture and a million dresses
Then they dropped on me, the fuzz, they caged me -- they started asking me about a man, some man, 'm supposed to have seen a year before that
Two years ago, two
He could be in Yemen
She waits for Klute to respond -- he doodles permissively on his pad of paper -- she goes on
(') name
Grunemann
Nothing
And they showed me pictures like this and they meant nothing
Then they asked me, well had  been getting letters, from someone out there in Cabbageville -- -- Tuscarora -- All right, yes,  had been
Those sick, wild letters -- 'm watching you, gonna follow you, gonna punish you, kill you et cetera
Well, they said, all right that's Grunemann
So try to remember when you and he - when -- well  don't know, there was that dumper once, he sounded like that dumper -- (explains) Dumpers; they get their kicks beating you up
man hired me once, then tried to really kill me - that'd be about two years ago
Without warning she wheels to the open windows, and shouts out full-voiced -- both startling and somewhat intriguing Klute -- (') (shouts) Tommy-baby, Allie-Allie-in-free kid,  got the gumdrops
Turns around again, to Klute
Cheerfully -- (') You remind me of my uncle
What
(then --) What do you remember about that -- dumper
Nothing
Except he wasn't kidding
Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know
They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you -- (beat) Hell it's their money
'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime
Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he -- But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann
can't say he was anybody
brief pause
Klute sorts his notes
She may take it that he's packing to leave -- hopes so anyhow
For an instant we see the undefended girl underneath -- (') So --  -- that's all
Then again she changes manner -- remembering a practical problem, approaching it as a matter-of fact hooker
(') Well could  have them back now hon
-- those tape recordings you've got downstairs --
-- and if you want you can have a good time and 'll have a good time and-- What about everything since
She draws back again
Up to now she's been reasonably on top of things
Starting now we see her driven toward the things she'd really rather not talk about -- and increasingly more shaken
(') (prompts) Everything that's happened since Tom Grunemann disappeared
The phone calls and the -- Just phone calls, right
They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank
Kids getting kicks
Burglars looking for an empty apartment
mean there is nothing that proves -- What about the other things you've reported
-- (consulting notes) -- being followed on the -- (interrupts -- awkwardly) Look -- 'm sorry -- 've led everybody wrong
mean yes,  get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings
(beat) 'm sure this will amuse you; 'm scared of the dark
And sometimes  get shook up,  hear people or -- well, 'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and  wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see
-- things other people wouldn't even notice
Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with -- The
She startles
Then approaches with some difficulty -- but then answers with complete calm in her Smith-girl voice
(') Bree Daniel
(listens
Brightly) Oh yes, Ted Carlin, how is Ted
(listens) Oh, well, thank you very much but maybe the next time you're in town
(listens) Well  just love Ted and 'd love to meet you -- you have a very nice voice -- but  just -- (listens, grows impatient) Well 'm having a chat with a very nice cop
Actually not a real cop; he's a private inves -- from the phone; the connection abruptly broken
She hangs up, recites
Is that how you get most of your dates
Someone gives your name to someone else
Most of them
Is that how you met the Dumper
-- Someone else gave -- How would  remember
How else do you meet them
Pimps
(a beat) (patient) You're very square
Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money
Klute takes up the slip of paper previously given him by Trask
In the same manner as before -- have some names the police gave me
Frank Ligourin
Will you tell me what -- (trembling) Look, 'm sure this'll amuse you too
Ilia trying to get away from all that
What about the old gentleman the other night, Mr
Faber
She freezes again, looking at him
Then savagely -- You saw that, goddamn you
You saw it
He's seventy
His wife's dead
He started cutting garments at fourteen
His whole life, he's maybe had a week's vacation, 'm all he has and he never, never touches me, and what harm in it, what -- She chokes -- then goes on -- (') Klute, tell me, what's your bag
Are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle
Or -- (under) --  -- -- You want to wear women's clothes, or you get off ripping things -- She grabs up the company picture, raging on -- (') -- you perverted hypocrite square bastards
Something in his inflection -- very slight -- cautions her
She falls silent as suddenly as she began
Then cheerfully -- Gee  hope this doesn't make my cold any worse
Tell me about Frank Ligourin
(casual, pleasant) Mm
Oh, he was my old man
We broke up
She wanders away toward a bureau
Her shirt seems to itch her; she scratches her ribs
Then opens drawer, takes out a different shirt as -- When
(beat) When did you and Ligourin break up
She pulls off her shirt, unhooks her brassiere and discards it, apparently quite unselfconscious
Klute reacts; then, carefully maintaining his cool (') Mind not doing that
She turns to him in total innocence, holding the shirt rather carelessly in front of her -- a new attack
What
This
--
(ingenuously) thought you could trick me for those tapes
Don't you get lonely in that little green room
Or let me get you someone;  have terrific friends, wild
No thanks
At this point -- or about this point -- Klute takes note of something
little above her
He grows more watchful, but containing it carefully
We don't understand the change in his manner -- or even notice; she doesn't
In mock dismay -- Gee
've had men pay two hundred dollars for me -- here, you're turning down a freebie
(pause) You can get a perfectly good dishwasher for that
He has risen, is approaching her slowly -- carrying his notes as if to check something
She is hopeful again -- (') You've changed your mind
You do want to play
(quietly, steadily) don't want you to look up
There's someone on the skylight
She gasps, terrified -- immediately -- almost beyond control
He taps the pencil on his notes
(') Easy -- pretend you're looking here- (more insistently) -- here
She manages to take hold of a corner of the notes, trembling
He goes on -- (') Now 'm going to walk around -- you just keep talking, straight through, straight through
He strolls away from her
His destination is the area of the door -- out of view from the skylight -- from where he can head for the roof
But he doesn't head that way directly -- first takes a turn in another direction, his bearing casual
Prompting -- (') Tell me about acting -- what are you doing tomorrow -- where do you go
(manages, barely) go on rounds
Rounds, what are they
-- don't watch me, keep talking
You go see agents -- or Equity calls, open casting calls
And ad agencies -- commercials -- you don't get work, you just go around
Klute has strolled out of view from above -- instantly flattens himself against the wall, eases the door open, about to slip and charge
As Bree labors on -- (') And they're always polite -- show people -- they say thank you very much
You lie there covered with blood, smiling, they say -- - across the roof above, as the watcher discovers Klute's ruse
Klute opens the door -- climbs ladder to roof
- -- Klute out, looking around -- :      - The figure -- the man -- scissoring over the low walls where one brownstone joins another
Klute gives chase -- over ridges, past water tanks, oddments of roof furniture -- - The  races to a roof door disappearing into abandoned building
- follows  as he cautiously makes his way down the stairwell of the boarded up old brownstone
He gets to the first floor
He can see no exit in the building
He opens door that leads to a narrow staircase into the cellar
- It is as black as a dungeon and as low
He lights a match, but sees no one
There is a sound of movement coming from the floor above, He runs up the steps to the floor above and sees a very faint light coming through one of the closed apartment doors
Carefully takes out a gun and then with one quick movement he breaks through the door
The walls, ceiling, floors are entirely covered with crudely painted psychedelic signs and sayings
The room is lighted by some candies stuck in bottles
Sitting on a blanket on the floor are several teenaged boys and girls having a pot party
They have obviously made a clubhouse for themselves in the abandoned house
It is a   whether they or  is more stunned at the sight that faces them
He puts his gun away in embarrassment
Again he has been made to feel like an awkward peeping tom in this hidden world of the city
- wanders restlessly through the blackness and stops at a pinpoint of light coming through a low door
goes through opening into long narrow furnace room with the ceiling so low that an ordinary man could not stand up
We hear the sound of breathing
follows the sound through the darkness revealing a sweaty man huddled in the corner looking like some strange animal from a painting by Bosch
It is Cable
'  - Bree has wrapped herself in the quilt -- standing up against a corner shivering, immobilized
We hear '   -- she flinches -- he enters
couldn't get him
He sees her condition
Gently -- (') It's all right
He reaches to touch her -- she quails away from him
Well do you think it was him
What do you think
Can't you get him
Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't
(pause) You asked me where  got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it
Do you know where he got the dumper
He never told me
Well, let's go down and ask him
- shot catching the edge of   itself -- our first small view of greenery -- to the tall, be limousined
The ,  walking upstreet, turning under one of the canopies -- (Klute carries a zipper book-case)
-     - The  hangs up the brass house-phone, smiles and gestures them graciously into the (self service)
We see Klute -- without making too much of it -- taking in the mirrors and marble work
(): , She breaks the silence
What did you expect
Frankie still has a good string, three girls
Figure three hundred a week from each
Is that what you gave him
Silence
' :   - The  sounding,   crossing to open the door for ,
Cheerful, hospitable, nice, unpretentious
Bree -- hi -- come in, come in
The point of this one brief shot -- Bree's face -- in the instant after Frank has spoken and before she enters, with Klute following
Her half-second of hesitation
This is someone who gets to her somehow -- probably always will
' :  - The apartment is as expected -- but not overdone; a certain small amount of someone-lives-here litter
few, large but not very good,  on the walls
There is a large  covered over with photographs and mock-ups of magazine pages, a felt board or easel with lettering samples -- Frank's props really
Frank -- Klute
(shakes hands) Hi
Come in
(leads them in, indicating table) was just catching up some work -- mocking up the photographs
(to Klute) used to be a photographer myself - Bree tell you
-- Before  got in the publishing
Frank, he knows you're a pimp
He knows you were my pimp
Short silence
Then with the tact of a gentleman dealing with rude, difficult woman -- Well Bree, maybe you'd rather -- He gestures gently to indicate outside
She nods once
He escorts her in that direction,  the door, closing it behind them
'  - He escorts her to the elevator, pushes the down button for her
In silence so far
Then, quietly -- as one who knows the other's thoughts -- How's it been
She shrugs a shoulder at him, looks away
He goes on in the same quiet voice
(') With me Bree it's eternally the same
Toward you
guess you know that
Yeah Frank,  know that
She yanks at the elevator doors
But the elevator's not here yet
She turns away sharply into the door marked "Stairway"
He turns back to his apartment
'  - Frank reenters, with the calm smile of troop chaplain
've always respected Bree
(then) 'd like to make something clear
've just got a few -- 'd like to make something clear don't go after a girl; a girl comes to me
Her choice
Right
He gestures Klute to one chair, sits in another, waits calmly, attentively
'm looking for a man
Tom Grunemann
(no response, whatever) Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago
She says you sent her on it
Two years ago
Sorry
They tell me you use narcotics
Could  bring someone around to look at your arms
Look -- dad --  may stand better with the cops than you
Klute waits
(') , a family matter
Between the girls
had two other cows -- (corrects himself) -- two other girls besides Bree
She told me
and one of them  Jane McKenna -- she blows a little jealous of Bree - you know
-- Bree comes first
And evidently she knew the freak --- that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to Bree, you know, so Bree'd get hurt
didn't know
Till afterwards
Why didn't you tell Bree, afterwards
(a little shocked) You don't tell them
That one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them
(shakes head) Peace in the family
(pause) Beyond that,  don't know
All she wrote
'd like to talk with Jane McKenna
(smiles) Would  be telling you all this
She copped out long ago
She committed suicide Baxter
:  - sits, looks with curiosity at housewives her age -- bringing their children in from the park, as if trying to imagine what their lives could be like
emerges from elevator
( ) - Did you like my friend Frankie
No
Didn't he tell you what you wanted
It didn't go anywhere
(then) But that's not why -- About the dumper, didn't he tell you that
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper
(coldly) Well -- she's dead
At the corner he slows, starts unzipping his bookcase as if indicating a change of route
(') thought you were going back to the apartment
(he shakes his head) You said you wanted these
He hands over the -
Oh golly, oh just what 've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls
(then) How come
You told me what you could
guess 'm through with your part of it
(grudgingly) Is there anything more  could -- don't see anything, do you
What're you gonna do next
Try some other ways
(starts off) What do  do meanwhile
-- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me
And  don't think that was Tom
You said it was
No,  said what did you think
Oh -- wait -- oh  get it
You said that just to keep me scared
So 'd tell you everything  -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick
Well -- (harshly) Hey, but did we get to you, Klute
little
Yeah, you got to me
-- Us city folks
The sin, the glitter, the wickedness
Oh
No
Not that way
'd say it was more --  don't know -- (hunts the word) -- too bad
Pathetic
Goodbye
She turns smartly away, deposits the tapes in passing in a litter box, departs
Klute looks after her for a moment, then turns on his way
Then -- ,  - This shot holds both in view for a moment, until they both disappear separately in the traffic
moves in slightly on litterbox as a man's hand comes into frame and removes the tapes
' :  - Klute, in pajama bottoms, lies in bed
miserably hot humid night
at the door
He answers
stands in the doorway in bare feet
What the hell do you mean, pathetic
She walks in past him, sits down on the edge of his bed
It's kind of late
It got lonely upstairs
There's someone on the roof
He takes her seriously, starts to move
(') Oh, don't be a doo-doo
Not much point to this, is there
(placidly) Ezra, 'm lots better than you're used to
Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr
Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out
Mm
So you're not too different from him, or the chap on the roof, or Tommy-baby -- He starts for the bed, as if to lift her onto her feet
She takes off her robe and swings her legs up, and under the sheet
(') Look, if you don't use it somebody else just will
And you've done your whole bit with me, your entire duty, and so now this is my thing
So enjoy, Mr
Faber would say, enjoy
Under the sheet she unlooses her pajama bottoms, kicks them away, starts unbuttoning the shirt
Bree -- thanks --  don't want to
Oh don't be all hypocrite
Or do you really like other kicks
Is it more just having power over someone
-- so you don't really need to -- He tries to rebutton the pajama shirt
She catches his hand, thrusts it underneath
In grief and anger -- (') Who the hell are you, buttoning me up
-- ,
Their bodies lock together descending toward camera -- -- , Her hands slide about his shoulders
She is laughing softly, affectionately, mockingly -- knew it,  knew it, a killer
-- , -- triumphantly, contemptuously, orgiastically -- Oh lover -- oh you thrill me -- oh, it's beautiful -- oh yes, yes -- oh like that, like that, yes -- -- Klute gasps deeply -- entering orgasm
As soon as she hears it, judges it, she drops her hands from his shoulders, stills her own movements, lies utterly passive, smiling calmly, letting him finish for himself
He can't stop -- cries out -- cries out again, burying his face against her -- is done
Then he slowly raises up, shuddering, looking down at her
He knows what she's done to him, is helpless to do anything back
He rolls slowly out of the embrace of her legs and lies silently -- looking upward, very much as we saw him at start of scene
She waits, still smiling, for a while
But she's not done with him yet
She rolls to lie with her upper body on his, trailing her fingers across his face
Affectionately, as a good whore -- (') What's the matter hon
You were great
Terrific
tiger
Thanks
Well what're you down about
You mean because you didn't get me there
(pause, comfortingly) You can't expect that
mean Frank, yes, he'd get me there all the time -- but never with a John
She sits up, gropes her pajamas from the floor, puts them on
In the same fond tone -- (') And 'm sorry  can't stay and learn your special little games
And  certainly don't want you to feel bad about this -- losing your virtue all of a sudden -- because sort of knew you would
As  said, like everyone, right
She has the pajamas and robe on, pauses near the door -- (') Besides - you can always tell yourself you made me come downstairs
Ta, luv
:   - An open casting call in an Off Broadway Theatre
Darkness, except for the work light onstage
small  there -- onstage -- including the figure of
Just offstage, the figures of  () and a
And the rest of the theatre, the audience section, dotted with the heads of ,  waiting for their turns
Bree's voice rings out across the gloom
-- Why
, The others stand rigid as statues, facing dead front -- an experimental drama, clearly -- all holding scripts, as Bree hastens from one to another, fiercely, imploringly -- (') Why -- please, why
-- Why lose, why look
Why hate and give and want and love
Why get, grieve, g -- (loudly, cheerfully) Thank you very much
All break posture, start offstage, while Bree, caught in mid-stride, clowns it a little
-- gug -- gug -- -- then toward Jang, a bit succinctly, indicating script -- (') Why
--  want to know what
(laughs tolerantly) No, that was very good everybody
Do we have all your resumes
(from list) Booth -- Osman -- Zuff -- Anjeris Chaka
, near stage front
Bree shrugs, steps down off stage with the others
Bree finds Jang's hand out for her script, smiles wanly, turns it over, continues on out of scene
She finds something - someone -- impeding her way
Looks up
Klute has edged out into the aisle to intercept her
:   - Bree comes out, turns
You asked if there was anything more you could help me with
When
Pause
Impasse
've checked the records of Jane McKenna's death --  can't get anything special
But Frank Ligourin had another girl you said, besides McKenna and you
Arlyn Page
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank
She's strung out now; you won't find her
You could help me find her
You know the people
(as she turns away) 'll pay you a hundred dollars
can make that in a lunch break
(then) Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me
-- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds
Don't worry
She examines him -- shrugs -- turns, proceeds along the sidewalk, Klute accompanying -- - In the small hours
The same place seen previously, the gathering place
,  arriving and entering
- Klute and Bree head toward the rear
Her arrival causes a little stir
She exchanges greetings with one or two, is watched by others
Joanie -- Mike, hi -- (to another, a Negro girl) Hi Pat
(giggles) Hey Bree honey, who you got
new daddy
'n he cute
Bree leads on to where -- , sits alone at a rear table -- anything but a whore in appearance -- a quietly beautiful, immaculately dressed woman of about thirty
(') Trina this is Klute
told you about him
Oh yes Mr
Klute -- won't you both join me
(as they sit) And how do you like our fair city
There's so much here don't you think
The museums and the books and the foreign films -- Bree, have you seen the Godard film
Uh uh
Oh you've got to
He does such fun things with imagery
And 've been reading The Fall -- (to Klute, enunciating carefully) -- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo -- it's the same thing, you know the imagery -- (patiently) Trina honey, he just wants to find Arlyn Page
Trina undergoes a change of demeanor
Flatly -- Why
She's a junkie
(prods gently) She was with you after she left Frank
Well she's not now
(then quavering --) did everything for Arlyn
loved Arlyn  took her right into my apartment, my own sweet apartment on First
But she wouldn't stay off it -- the junk -- and  wept and pleaded and  held her in my arms - and she started taking things, my things, and selling them for horse
My clothes
We could've had everything together, everything -- and then the bitch sold my mink
- We dolly with  &  as they walk in front of a row of tables
This night spot is totally black except for a series of huge slide projections on the wall in back of the tables
The slides, which change every few seconds are elegant representations of the beautiful people living the good life as seen in such magazines as , &  &
The customers sitting in the darkness below provide a direct contrast to the pictures in back
The silhouette figures of &  stop at a table seating three people, two call girls and a pimp
moves in
Arlyn Page
You'll never catch up; she's grooved out
Gil
The pimp looks distrustfully at Klute who reassures -- 'm not looking for her personally - someone she might know about
(shrugs; to Bree) Try Janie Dale
' It is a very small penthouse
&  stand in the small living room waiting for
There are two very casually dressed prostitutes sitting around the living room
One sits at an upright piano playing of all things
Another one sits on a couch talking to a Wall Street Broker who is spending his lunch hour finds himself staring down into a pile of pornography magazines on the coffee table
is amused at his discomfort
, the madame, who has been on the phone in the back, puts the receiver down and crosses to the girl on the couch
looks and talks a bit like Lauren Bacall
(to girl on couch) It's old Mr
Clean from Cleveland
He wants to know when he can fly in and clean up the apartment and see you
told him  have all the cleaning equipment and that he can come anytime, but it's up to you
on couch rises
You know he wants us to be dominant
Tell him that he'd better have his ass in here by one o'clock on Monday afternoon or you won't let him clean the bathroom floor, and tell him the price has gone up twenty bucks -- Old Dutcn Cleanser's not as cheap as it used to be
She shrugs and turns to  &
(') You wanted to know about Arlyn, honey
had to let her go dear
Arlyn stopped being reliable
(explains to Klute) deal with a high type client, business people, you understand can't send them someone that's all the time half zonked out
Do you know where she went
Try Momma Reese
' The girls look cheaper, and the customers, rather than Wall Street lawyers and brokers, look more like out of town salesmen who stay at local motor inns
is older than  , heavier and with no pretense at chic
She indicates that she has not seen  in some time
Try Bill Azure
If you can find him
-  4 This is a hangout where black and white pimps wait to meet their whores after their night of street walking
This streetwalker world is far removed from the world of the call girl or the world of Janie Dale
pans past a group of pimps at the bar taking bet on whose girls have made the most money that night
then goes on to reveal  talking to another pimp (Azure)
Azure represents a clear step down from Frank Ligourin
We catch only part of their dialogue
-- a couple weeks then she'd drift off a couple of weeks, you know what  mean
Have you heard from her recently
She liked me all right but she had what she liked better, you know what  mean
We    as Klute repeats -- Have you heard from her recently
-- and   -- : , , -- She'd come in and 'd let her have something
Why not; she'd been a good customer, a beautiful person, a beautiful beautiful person
Again we fade sound a little before picture, then -- : , - Outside Theatre or Bookstore - Peepshow; an 8th Avenue establishment
this (or )
Klute confers with one girl who summons and consults another
They seem to know of Arlyn -- haven't seen her recently -- refer him elsewhere -- :
,  - shabby place in a shabby neighborhood
Mrs
Vasek, the landlady, shifts barrels at the same time that she barks at Klute, in heavy accent
The whore, yeah
threw out
Do you know where she went from here
Live like animals
Her and the man
Out
(reacts) Was she living with a man
We see Klute persisting - :   - We still   to establish the scene
This is a genuine slum
We see Bree, Klute move along street
We see Bree drop back a little, Klute waiting for her to catch up
: , What's the matter
(glances about) What the hell do you think's the matter
(then suggests) could wait for you someplace
If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann -- (eagerly) -- Then you don't need me
But if it's someone else  do
He starts on, simply assuming that she'll follow
(There is a degree of acquaintanceship in their manners now - a reluctant collaboration
) You sure pull a lot of mileage out of a hundred dollars
-- and follows on
He checks numbers, then crosses street diagonally toward a half-framed house
- downshot from second floor level toward the entry way where  &  appear
strikes a match to inspect the names of tenants
He and Bree climb through stench and litter to the second floor -- a door
From somewhere near at hand come the sounds of someone
square of wood has been sawed out of the door itself, removing handle and lock -- light sifts through
Klute hesitates, decides against knocking, pushes in
'  - The retching sounds are coming from the connecting room
No one visible here
very few barren pieces of furniture
We hear '  ask from the next room -- (
) Cappy
enters rather eagerly
She sees Klute first, then Bree -- recognizes her -- retires flat against a wall, holding one palm outwards to shield her face
She is unbelievably gaunt
Inside one elbow, looking rather like a birthmark, we see a lacework of purple where her veins have pulped together
Arlyn
Honey
(then) Look, it's all right
From the connecting room a '  (Berger's) calling out hoarsely
(
) Is it Cappy
Cappy
-- Arlyn, it's all right
hastens, stumbles, into the doorframe carrying a - with wires dangling, speaks before he sees them
Cappy,  got a radio
He stops for an instant face-to-face with Klute
Then turns, plunges out of view again
Arlyn breaks after
No -- We hear the  and  of their voices from the connecting room (as she reassures him)
Bree looks inquiringly at Klute (is that Grunemann
): he shakes his head
Pause, then  reenters, wrapping her fingers together timidly -- wanting them out -- her only purpose
(') Bree -- honey - please, we're waiting for someone
Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about
Can't you see 'm strung out
(cries out) Please, we're waiting for it -- he's got to have it
We'll go
Just something you could tell us, first
Arlyn seems to accept the bargain
He indicates to Bree to proceed, stands away a little
Arlyn covers her elbow with one hand
Bree manages as best she can
Honey, a couple of years ago, with Jane and Frankie
-- Jane sent me a Dumper -- Please, if he sees you, he won't come
Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns
What about him
Yes
Did he come around often
Klute hands Grunemann's picture to Bree: Bree shows it to Arlyn
Arlyn inspects it, then uncertainly, weakly -- No
He was an older man hon
The dumper was older
Do you remember his name
What can you tell me about him
We hear  - ,  - mounting the stairs
Bree notices them first, Klute persisting with Arlyn -- (
) (shouts desperately) Arlyn, get them out
Please,  am begging you
It's important
That's not the Dumper, that's all
He was an older man
Can you give me any more description than that
Arlyn catches the footsteps, dodges past him toward the door, intending to reassure -- Cappy
-- -- as the pusher, , steps in
All of this is very quick, simultaneous, a confusion of voices
takes one look at Klute -- (') It's all right, they're all right -- -- turns and runs
(
) Cappy
-- Cappy
Cappy's  race away down the stairs plunges out from the connecting room, still carrying the car radio, shouting, pursuing -- (') Cappy it's all right
got a radio -- don't run, don't -- We hear him    on the stairs outside, the sound of body reeling down
Arlyn shrieks and races after: Klute and Bree follow
:   - We see  lying at the foot of the stairs
As Arlyn clatters down toward him, Berger sways up onto his knees
His nose is bloodied, he cries
Arlyn casts herself on her knees beside him, pulls his face against her, croons to him, soothes and tends him
Oh baby -- no it's all right -- oh my baby baby baby -- Klute and Bree are only a half-step behind
Klute offers to assist: Arlyn puts him away ferociously
(') Get out
(to Berger, again) Don't cry my baby; 'll find him, 'll get it
Baby, baby, don't cry
(to Klute savagely, incoherently) Leave us alone
Get out and get out and leave us alone
(to Berger) My honey, my baby, my baby -- We   -- : moves in closer so we only see reflection of looking at herself and at the world seeming to speed by at an inhuman pace as the lights of the tunnel zoom past her face
What she sees is the figure of a woman with life screaming past her out of control
slows to a stop and a door opens
sits with  staring at the open door and then without warning - gets up and runs off the train
The door closes, leaving  locked in the train
of 's feet rushing up the stairs in darkness and then quick cut to her face as she hits the sunlight
She pauses for a moment - relieved to be out of the darkness
'  - pans from night view of New York City to sitting on the rooftop alone as if trying to comprehend all he has seen, the mystery of 's disappearance in this world and the mysteries of the behavior of
'  - Alongside of him the skylight of 's apartment lights up
He looks through the skylight and sees enter her apartment
He can hear  talking to somebody, and then he sees that she is talking to
watches through the skylight and hears bits and pieces of the scene between  and
He sees the same kind of symbiosis, the same kind of parody of loving that he saw between  & As the scene becomes more intimate he leaves
' () :   - The pristine, antiseptic, elegance off ' office is in its own way as unreal and dehumanized as the sexual underworld  has been exploring with , and  looks as out of place in the one as he does in the other
sits beside facing  who is impeccably dressed
He is the total image of the executive in control
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict
believed her, Pete
He's right you know
Waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything
believed her: the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you
(smiles ruefully) It's where it doesn't get me
've got nothing left that connects to anything
Then, close the case
better keep looking
Where, how
(the best he can offer) could try Arlyn Page again
She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel
You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer
Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom
It's got to make sense some way
'  appears for a moment tapping her watch significantly
Mr
Cable -- they are meeting in Mr
Camara's office
Yes Evvie, thanks
Gentlemen, 'm sorry
They rise, dismissed
He sorts a paper or two, continues to Klute
(') 'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; 'll fill them in on things
How is it back there
think you're homesick
(reflects) 'll be out at my camp over the weekend
Nice right now, that touch of fall in the air, that skim of frost in the early mornings, very peaceful
(briskly again) John, 'll be back here again Thursday; 'll be in touch
Lieutenant, thank you
and  depart
closes the door and returns to his desk
He pulls out a tape recorder from a drawer in his desk, rewinds it and turns it on
We hear a playback of the previous scene with  and He stands at the window listening with some satisfaction; as if listening to what revealed keeps him in control of the situation
- '  - The  pulls back from a  of  standing at the window to a wide angle looking at through the window
The window is 30 or 40 stories high
The wide angle lens almost makes the building look like it is standing on point, and , a man suspended in space
:  - has pulled in
The  of its heavy , , runs underneath this entire sequence
or two has parked at the head of the dock
We see several figures on the rear deck of the tug, but it's not clear at this distance what they're doing
The arrives
He dismounts and proceeds from dock to tug-deck
:  - glances toward Klute as he arrives, but doesn't greet him
His attention, like the others, is directed downward and off-scene (to the surface of the water actually, just outboard of the tug)
We see beside Trask Uniformed Cops ( and ) and
And we hear, along with the throbbing of the engines, a stirring about of the water and a peculiar third noise -- rather commingled with the engines -- which we can't at first identify
Klute joins the group, watches
brings into view, and shakes out, a giant neoprene body bag
among the group ,  -- (toward Klute) They were bringing a freighter down through Kill Van Kull; propellers washed it up on top
brings into view a   attached with short ropes
He complains -- Why didn't you bring it up on deck
Would you bring it up on deck
They slip the basket downward, out of frame (into the water)
(') (to other) Mickey, get something
Get the eels off
(calmly) They'll drop off theirselves when she comes out
We   - - We see Berger sitting huddled against the tugboat cabin -- we haven't seen him before -- with his hands bunched in front of his mouth
We identify the noise which may have puzzled us before -- his :   , , We catch a fleeting glimpse of the body being lifted, just before it breaks the surface of the water
Klute looks on as  trace the processing of the body
kneels down out of frame to slide the bag around it
kneels down to make a brief examination -- straightens again
To Klute -- It'll go to the Examiner
But don't see nothin that means nothin
We    as he turns and moves away a few feet along deck
Here he stands
Then moves into view holding a clipboard
Routinely -- You help us with
We can't get nothin from him
He indicates the direction of Berger
Klute examines the clipboard data
Arlyn Page was probably an alias
She went by the names Terry Arlyn and June Price
She may have been from Pittsburgh, someone told me can give you a list of people who knew her, if that would help to -- No point, thanks
Is he claiming the body
Uh uh, that'd mean funeral expenses
He spits, moves back in the direction of the group; Klute continues to stand
moves in his direction
Brokenly -- Man could you help me
Klute doesn't understand his purport, reacts instantly, sympathetically -- Yeah, what
You know, help me out
That's my baby there, dead
got to get up
Klute stares at him -- a quiet horror -- as Berger insists -- (') Man you don't know what that does to me, my baby dead -- -- You've got to get up
Yeah
Klute shoves a bill in his hand, turns away very sharply, off the tugboat
:  - Klute walks a longer distance this time, sits down on one of the pilings of the dock
Watching him we see what might be a profound awe and grief at all these things -- but is, in fact, a good deal more
,
as Police Vehicles are loaded, driven away and as tug toots, runs up engines, puts out again
moves into scene, sits on another piling, looks at him speculatively
Silence
Then -- That's how the other one died, you know
In the water
(nods) looked it up
Then -- (we are assuming a complete understanding here between Klute and Trask, non-verbal
What Trask is asking, in effect, is: is this meaningful
Do we both suspect the same man
) Well
Yeah
'  - It is late afternoon, but  is in her pajamas curled up in her bed
There are some magazines scattered around the bed and the television set is on an old movie
There are cracker crumbs in the bed and a cup of coffee and an open jar of peanut butter with the knife sticking out of the jar on the floor by the bed
It would seem that  has spent most of the day in bed
She looks like an unkempt child
The phone is ringing, but she does not answer it
The phone no sooner stops than the door bell rings
Reluctantly she gets out of bed and goes to the door
She looks through the spy hole and sees Klute's face
She undoes two locks and an obviously new chain and bolt and opens the door
Well hello -- come on in
He barely enters the room
His manner is cool and remote
thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead
How
The same as Jane McKenna
(she betrays no reaction) Thanks for the jolly news thought maybe you'd left town by now
You kind of just disappeared
But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you
Klute looks around the disorderly room
The plants in the windowsill have never been in worse shape
They look as if she deliberately let them die of thirst
The next few weeks  would like to know where you are all the time
(harshly) Why
Just let me know when you are going out and where -- What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along
You could sit and read the National Geographic
How can you do it to yourself
(coolly) don't get you
Ligourin: How could you do it
told you before, you wouldn't understand
You're right,  don't understand
Explain it to me
(pause) You were scared
Arlyn Page, that scared you
Well it should; that's death
So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death
Ligourin kills women
No
No, no you're right, 'm sorry
He uses women; he lets them kill themselves
Is that how you want it
Arlyn was a junkie; 'm not on junk
No, you can find some other way
(beat) Explain it to me
Bree, show me any sense to -- (screams, incoherently) You get the Christ out
You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out
don't have to show you anything; you get out
Klute goes
'  - The empty apartment
He enters, switches a light on (dusk), tosses aside jacket, bookcase, etc
, then sits down on the edge of his bed, with one foot propped up on it
and   at the door
He looks up, but doesn't move, doesn't answer
opens it, enters
There are tear-tracks down her face, but she's no longer crying
She tries to smile, tries to explain her wants
Then with the unhurried, graven composure of absolute desperation, she sits on the edge of the bed
If  asked you something, would you not laugh
-- asked you to look at something
She pushes up her sleeve, points at tiny spot on her arm - a freckle
He peers at it then at her puzzledly
(') (apologetic) thought it was maybe changing shape or something
Klute looks at it again
Judiciously -- He shows her a spot or two on his own forearm
She compares, is reassured
Embarrassedly, she tries to smile
It is unsuccessful
She gets up and moves about
Her manner in general is totally unguarded, honest, undramatic, searching
(') Look --  hate everybody; and 'm sorry for everybody; and 'm scared all the time
He only grunts
sound like '' or 'all right' -- an invitation to leave
But she won't be driven away
More urgently, helplessly: (') Look,  don't know either
It's like the only thing  know how to do --  feel safe
She's left the door a little ajar
He widens it for her
It's been a full day
She pushes it out of his hand, pushes it shut little more angrily: Please
We did this before
No
(then) Well all right
But you want to and want you to and we both know it and all right
(evenly, slowly) don't like getting splashed
She accepts it decently
Tries to smile again, nods
----- She gestures, tries to find something more to say, moves by degrees toward the door -- and would succeed in leaving
But then: --- Bree --- Standing still, she starts again to cry -- and bravely to keep the crying to herself
The child bereft
He contends with himself, then crosses to her, puts his arms around her, soothes her hair completely asexual gesture at this point, a giving of comfort
She clings, trembles, burrows
Then -- a   : The street outside, at different times of night interposed, with Bree and Klute at different times of love, As Follows: - The street as we saw it just previously
still daylight
still somewhat populated, but drawing toward dusk
: ' : ,  - Darkness now, or close to dark; the room heavily shadowed
Bree and Klute sit together on the bed
He still strokes her hair
He has pulled a blanket around her shoulders
The transaction is still not overtly sexual, but the tenderness is more overt
He rubs his cheek against her forehead
She herself is quieter, comforted
She begins to stir against him
: - The street at night
Eleven o'clock, let's say
Some lit windows; a single car moving past
: - All the windows dark this time
The deepest night, just before the sky begins to lighten
: ' : ,  - Klute is alseep -- more or less -- on his stomach
Bree beside him lies awake
She trails her fingers about his back
rather tentative, exploratory business
Her expression is more wondering than anything else -- what does she have here, and can she get used to it
: -  () The street's first stirrings
From not far off, the sounds of trash cans being collected
: ' : ,  -  () Klute half sits up in bed
Bree is fast asleep with her head pillowed on his midsection
Some humor in this shot: he wants to move but doesn't want to wake her
At a point he risks it, reaches out for something beside the bed
Her eyes open immediately
He puts his hand on her face, trying gently to press her back
Go back to sleep
But she takes his hand -- and retains it -- rolls onto her back
Still relaxed, but a little more separate, thoughtful -- a mixture of the Bree we've seen before and the Bree we've glimpsed, the possible Bree
She observes: 'm still scared
(beat) mean different but still
(frowns) Look,  made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so  only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed
My bed
She grins, then starts to reach for him, still receptive -- then feels another (and genuine) pang, turns her head away sharply
Oh
He looks at her with concern, but only caresses her
She manages to explain -- (') am scared
The things  do
The things  could do to you
Mm
No, not just 'mm'
You don't know what  -- He settles himself beside her, makes overtures
She responds, but: (') Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good
Yup
She pretends to bite -- they tussle -- she feels a suddenly growing excitement, seizes him
Fiercely, welcomingly, full out
Oh -- And we cut directly to: ' : ,  - Bree standing, angry, antagonistic, demanding
In a way -- a Bree-like way -- she's seized psychiatry by the throat
The son of a bitch seduced me
She waits
Spangler says nothing
(') know: it's ridiculous
But it's tearing me up and  don't know why
And look, all right,  came here didn't
And if  have to, 'll keep coming here, the works, and talk about my mummy and my daddy and 'll even pay for it, but will you kindly for God's sakes say something
(smiles) 'd just be guessing
Guess
Maybe this wasn't just a trick
Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve -- (primly, distintly) do not love him
(undeterred, suggests) You've spent your life avoiding this
You'll try hard to deny it; you're quite likely to destroy it
: Sunlight is beaming on the graceful fountains and elegant architecture
Groups of cheerful tourists are admiring the civilized monuments to man's search for culture
pans to ugly street across the way revealing Klute approaching and entering a dingy warehouse topped by an absurdly placed copy of the Statue of Liberty
This is the municipal storehouse
- The abrupt cut from the bright sunlight leaves us in almost total darkness as we follow
We are in a huge storeroom
As we grow accustomed to the darkness we see bits and pieces of incongruous objects scattered along Klute's path - old pieces of furniture, lamps, piggy banks, etc
- the remnants of the lives of the plundered, the destroyed and the dispossessed
Some is stolen property, some evidence for homicide cases, and some the unclaimed possessions of the unclaimed dead
-- an ancient retainer sort, a civil servant, leads  into an old elevator cage
Klute and Custodian as elevator ascends; looking up the elevator shaft through the open cage we see a series of doors hanging over space seeming to lead nowhere
The whole sequence has the feeling of a dream of being lost in a black limbo
Klute and Custodian leave elevator on higher floor and walk down the long very low corridor past rows of locked vault doors
The Custodian stops at one and opens it
We are in a small dungeon-like room filled with banks of files from floor to ceiling
The Custodian counts to himself -- Four -- five -- what number'd say
Four ninety-seven, Jane McKenna Custodian finds it, unlocks for Klute's inspection
Reaches for paper Klute's holding
-- And  keep the authorization, please
thought there'd be more
Klute pokes through a small collection of personal effects -- perhaps an ankle bracelet, rabbits foot, faded snapshot of a child, some letters, pitiful remnants of Jane McKenna's life
Klute closes the drawer, and the front of the drawer is marked McKENNA,
Over the visual material of Klute's trip through the warehouse we hear     bits and pieces of  talking with the psychiatrist
(
) All right
Loneliness
(space) Well -- separated
From other people
Forgotten
(space) Well, as if  can be here,  can go through the motions, right
But the truth is,  don't belong
(
) (prompts mildly) Don't belong
(
) (snappishly) Do you always have to repeat
(
) Sorry
(then) (
) Well it's more than loneliness
Hate
People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know
'm all screwed up
(
) You think people hate you
(
) The truth is  hate them: they must hate me
All right, the money
(pause) All right, not the money
kind of put-on
It gets things back together
(pause) Well let's say 'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout mean before -- before  got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down
They didn't want me
(
) Didn't want you
(
) (snaps) said that
(resumes) Well, so you have a choice
You can either feel lonely -- you know, the hate -- or -- (then more rapidly, plunging) So you take a call and go to a hotel room and there's some John you've never seen before, but he wants you
He must, he's paying for it
(beat) And usually they're nervous and that's all right, too, because you're not; you know this thing
And then for a while, boy, they really pay attention, you're all there is
(beat) And it's not real and you don't have to even like them -- you can even hate them, it's all right, it safe -- you know
- On the left a portion of the original obscene letter
On the right a series of comparison documents -- beginning with a portion of a personal letter
We hear ', '  , and occasionally cut to them as -- ' (skipping, summarizing) All right, there's Tom Grunemann, you're right, different margins, different spacing absolutely, sloppy, right
' Mm
' All right, try this next guy
The right-hand document is switched
, Klute reacts
Think this is our guy
don't know
It looks familiar to me
Thought it might
It's off an arrest report you typed two years ago
Man you wanted samples of everybody
Then -- with subdued satisfaction, switching the projector again
(') Now the next cat
Mm
; ' Same margins top and sides
He does best with his middle fingers; you get fainter registration from outside keys like , , ,  and like that
Next thing look around apostrophes, how he hits the space bar before -- &  - But what reason could he have
What possible reason
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance
knew Tom never wrote that letter
What else do you know
never could believe that Tom was a split personality
never believed he was a Dumper; and don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and  don't believe he's alive
We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body
don't believe Tom's alive
As Klute talks he paces back and forth in the darkness
He crosses in front of the lighted screen; the letters projected on the screen ripple over his face
(') But why
Why
Klute and Trask are seen entering from the Projection Room
In the background we see an old black woman sitting in front of the picture file of unidentified dead, carefully studying each picture
In the foreground Klute sits down at a phone and dials
Yes, Mr
Cable's office, please
goes in close on Klute
' (through telephone) John, how are you
'll be sending you on a report tonight
' It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - don't envy you that humidity in the city
It's not so bad
There is a silence
Both Klute and Cable seem to be waiting for one or the other to make the next move
(') Would you like to know what's in it
The report
' (obligingly) What's in it
think Tom Grunemann's dead
've been a lot of places - 've asked a lot of people
've found no proof he's around
've found no proof he was ever around
How do you go from that to the idea Tom's dead
Suicide you're suggesting
He killed himself
(plodding, unemphatic) He could've been murdered
' 'm sure the  and the Police explored that possibility
No
They never did, really
But that's what 'm going to recommend
The next step
Unless something -- ' Have you discussed this with them
It's in the report
' Do they have the report
Have you discussed it with them
wanted to give it to you first
' All right
All right -- (then) John, just sit tight will you
'll read your report, 'll discuss it with the others
'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then
Nothing til Thursday, all right
All right
' Thank you
Goodbye, John
Goodbye, Pete
Klute hangs up
(') He was always at their house on holidays
Tom and Holly always had him, over on holidays
Tom felt sorry for him - his whole life was work
Tom felt sorry for him
The old black lady motions to Trask who crosses to her
She points to a picture in the file
She has obviously found her missing person among the photographs of the unidentified dead
She starts to stand but then sits again, obviously shaken
Klute crosses to her and gently helps her out of the chair
He sees in her face the same sense of loss he feels for his friend
-   - & Bree examining and feeling fruit in some imitation of a very shrewd and experienced housewife shopper
She is obviously enjoying her sense of domesticity, and Klute is amused by her enjoyment
-   - The nursery is an absurdly cheerful spot of greenery in the midst of the dirty chaos of the avenue
Klute and Bree wander through the plants
saw Mr
Faber
(beat) You remember Mr
Faber, don't you
(controlledly) Yeah
Is that all you have to say
What am  supposed to say
Well,  told him  wouldn't - uh - go there any more
(pause) know it's tough to understand, but it wasn't easy
You see, he was nice to me
mean, it wasn't just him
got something out of it too guess
Anyway,  told him wouldn't go there anymore
She is like a child awaiting praise from her teacher
Klute says nothing
They continue walking among the plants and he picks up a few that she had admired
Well, here's your gold star
Considering his contempt for all the dead plant life he has seen in her apartment in the past, she is pleased by this act of belief in her
Spangler says we have a relationship
What
You and  -- a relationship
was wondering what that was
(beat) Hell there's nothing so mysterious about the square life
- Bree, Klute approach unhurriedly along the sidewalk
She is holding his arm,  to herself, enjoys the evening
- We follow them up
- The apartment is a shambles -- furniture overturned, decorations ripped from the wall, bedding scattered and ripped
- Klute jettisons the grocery bags, thrusts himself inside, looks quickly about, finds no one
Bree follows more slowly, whispering: Oh Jesus
Oh Jesus
Don't touch anything
He moves quickly to the rear of the apartment, looks at the rear window which has been broken inward in a litter of glass -- then returns to the table at the front of the apartment; his folders
Bree cracks wise, unsteadily
You suppose he's a married fella
; The contents of the folders have been spilled across the table and -- we   -- the photographs of Tom Grunemann sorted out and ripped apart, Even the   photograph has been painstakingly torn, specifically to destroy the image of Grunemann in the front row
He stands, looking down, taking no notice as -- He got in my clothing
Then a moment later, she cries out again, more sharply: (') Oh
Oh
He turns quickly
She is holding out, at arms length, a pair of her underpants
With a disgust so extreme she can only laugh
(') Oh look what he did in them
Drop it
She doesn't respond
He seizes her arm, shakes the garment back onto the floor
She starts to gag, slaps her hand over her mouth, starts for the bathroom
Klute yanks her back
(') Stay out of there
She twists free of his hands, backs away
The same elementary terror we've seen before
(') Listen to me: It's all right
've been expecting something
(full out, vengefully) My God,  thought it was over
And here  am, daddy, right back at the start
Bree -- Right back at the start, right
Go down in my room
You said it was over, right
You said not to worry any more, all over, right
She's broken for the door; it's questionable that she's even heard him
He hasn't time to pursue -- shouts again -- Go down in my room and wait
Then he turns back into the apartment
'  - (as if from Klute's , connecting directly to the previous shot) -- then a goes off and a hand and pair of tongs enter frame and flip the garment into a collecting box and we widen to reveal that it's now daylight and the scene has been invaded by One is a photographer; another, a fingerprint man, is spraying surfaces with a can of fixative
In the foreground Klute and Trask are talking with Ross, the  man
Ross is looking through a dossier on Cable that Klute has compiled
Over the following conversation we show  of material in the dossier
It contains photographs of Cable and his life from childhood to the present - including pictures of him with his mother and father - she a very dominant looking lady and he a very passive looking man; also graduation pictures and pictures with his former wife taken when he was still a very young man
They are the personal images of a life time
(to Klute) But if Cable killed Grunemann why would he get you hired to look for Grunemann
Because he knew  couldn't leave the case alone
And this way at least he'd keep track of it
And me
What about Grunemann's letters to the girl, everything like that
Cable's letters, Cable's phone calls
Cable's everything else
He's been a Dumper a long time
He just passed off his own peculiar habits on the other man -- it kept things goin'
, pretend  believe you
Tell me how you get an indictment
Can't
Yet
Oh we got everythin' else: first rate evidence Cable typed those dumper letters to Bree Daniel
And Jane McKenna: Klute found a couple in her personal remains
We got dates of Cable's trips here coincidin' with phone calls to Bree Daniel, also the dates of death of McKenna and Page
We got some hints of his personal history
His father, unsuccessful salesman, committed suicide when he was 13
His mother pinned all her hopes on her son
He won a national science youth award at the age of eight
They had no money, but she hired special tutors for him in the summer time
She saw a good thing
He graduated from high school at 14 -- college at 16 -- no friends -- The kids in his class thought of him as a freak
He got his Ph
at 18 -- married at age 21 to his then employer's daughter
The marriage lasted 4 weeks
Her father had it annulled
She says he was impotent
World War  he got in bad trouble about a German girl, no details
We think we know why he killed Grunemann -- he found out Cable was a dumper; Cable couldn't take that
We think we know why he killed McKenna -- she wanted to blackmail him for it
All fine
But we got no body, no direct witnesses, we can't go any-damn-where
That's the reason i told him we had no evidence Tom was still alive
We wanted to shake him into another phone call or another letter
It didn't work out just that way
The Technicians, meanwhile have packed to depart
The first Technician scoops the torn up photographs into another collecting box
Trask retrieves the company outing photograph
Gov, want to leave me that one
How come he got to play with this one, anyway
left them here
was doing some work here
Trask eyes Klute for a moment, as if a querying his relationship with Bree
Klute is clearly unresponsive
Trask resumes
It's damn lucky you didn't have the dossier on Cable here
Nobody's seen that
If we get anything from the lab, we'll have it by noon
And just think -- all he really had to do was write us a letter
Sounds to me you better shake him again
Put him in a spot he has to do something more -- but this time give him a time and a place to do it
He called this morning from Tuscarora
Asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport
He's on his way to Chicago
He sure chalks up a lot of flight time
Klute starts gathering his papers we   -- :  - Bree coming up the stairs meets the Technicians coming down -- stands aside to let them pass -- starts up again and comes face to face with Klute
On her part we see a wish to be reconciled -- a shyness mixed with defiance -- but Klute's manner is arduous
She smiles nervously, asks -- Ah, Schmendrick -- what's the scam
Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment
(mock delight) Oh zippidy-doo, they'll find my fingerprints
(then) Can  go in
need some stuff
He nods; she starts by
Then -- Where'd you spend last night
With Trina
called Trina
Maybe  wasn't there when you called
Bree, what's actually happened
It wasn't that bad
(cuts in harshly) How do you know how bad it was
Why couldn't you stay here with me
Because  didn't want to be touched
didn't think you'd get that
Pause
Then, evenly -- Trask wants to talk with you
She starts on, then turns back toward him -- rather pleadingly -- Hey -- look officer --  can explain everything
It was just -- you know, everything all of a -- Trask wants to talk with you
She continues on up; Klute continues down
'  - Entering without greeting Trask (his manner is not uncivil but simply neutral, unreacting, Cop-like) she quickly gathers up a few properties, a change of shoes
Miss Daniel, be sensible, you find another place till we get things cleaned up
(brightly) Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it
few more days
We know who did this
So do
No, not Grunemann
He's dead
The man that killed him -- also prob'ly Jane McKenna, also Arlyn Page
She spins around -- mute -- terrified
(manages) Arlyn and Jane commited suicide
He said they commited suicide
Now there's a picture 'd like you to -- You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that
Well we're pretty -- Why isn't he locked up
We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more
Is that why Klute didn't tell me
guess he figured it was better
What was better
made better bait
No, that's not -- Is that what he set me up for
Everything he's told me from the beginning
-- don't worry, don't -- (coldly) From the beginning  don't know why the hell he's messin with you
If he was me he'd know better
If he was even a city boy he'd know better
You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right
Now somethin 'd like you to look at
don't have to look at anything don't have -- Here please
He coerces her to the table and unrolls the Company outing picture
(We see the rip extending up through the image of Tom Grunemann in the front row
) Oh no
Like for you to look for the man
Grunemann
've looked at him a -- Trask has clamped his thumb over the torn image of Grunemann, indicates with the other hand -- No
Not Grunemann
The Dumper
Just look around --  said look for the Dumper
We see her comply -- her eyes moving over the rows of faces
Then we see her stiffen, hear her gasp -- Oh
-- -- and    -- - Cable welcomes Klute
His outer manner is warm, voluble, congratulatory -- Sorry we had to meet here
But 'm pressed for time
Well there's a couple -- read your report
had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around -- Well as a matter of -- 've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp
don't even have a telephone there
This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me
Yeah
'm on my way to Chicago
Very important meeting tonight
Well -- any new developments
Yeah, two things Pete, that -- You said Trask was arranging laboratory work
Police laboratory
Anything from that
Yeah
It wasn't Tom
'm sorry
don't understand
It wasn't Tom that broke in the room
It has to be Tom
You said he ripped up his own pictures, he -- Not Tom
Whoever it was left a kind of souvenir,  told you, in her clothing
Semen
The laboratory got a blood group reading from that
The man was blood type 0; Tom was an
(slowly) Some mistake perhaps that -- No
No mistake Pete
It doesn't prove who it was -- but proves it wasn't Tom
You must be discouraged
(prosaically) Not too bad
This brings back that Dumper in the picture
That who
Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew
You said he was no possible connection with Tom
The Page girl told you that, not Tom
Someone's been doing all these things
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone
Pete, 've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book
What
Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients
Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money
Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen
've been after it a long time
You were hired to look for Tom
'm meeting a man tomorrow night
He wants to meet me on East-River Drive -- he wants five hundred dollars for the book
Can you get that for me Pete
Sometime -- right along about now -- it privately comes to Cable that Klute may know everything and that he, Cable, may be being trapped
can't follow you
Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients
No
It's ridiculous
This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann
(shrugs, stolidly) It probably has the Dumper's name
It might give us some kind of new lead
(beat) want a look at it anyhow
Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann
Solely and exclusively
You say you can't find Tom; all right, 'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed
All right, but 'm going to see that list
is announced over loud speaker and Cable and Klute walk onto field
People are boarding helicopter
Why would they deal with you
You don't know these people
Klute is momentarily at a loss -- not a question he'd prepared for -- improvises
No, but Bree does
She's negotiating for me
Bree Daniel
Cable takes an instant to compute the thing
Then -- can talk it over; possibly  can get the money
When are you meeting the man
Tomorrow evening, nine
East River Drive and 73rd Street
Suppose  meet you there a half hour before
Just send me a money order
No, 'd -- like to be in on it
comes over to motion Cable onto the helicopter
Klute smiles awkwardly, raises his hand in a goodbye gesture
Well -- Tomorrow
See you tomorrow night
Cable sits down next to window
The helicopter begins to rise
goes into a medium close shot of Cable against the helicopter window
The helicopter ascends in front of a very tall office building made up of endless glass squares telephoto lens brings the glass squares of the building directly against Cable's head and shoulders giving us the feeling that Cable is almost levitating by himself
As one floor after another disappears behind him we see an almost manic exhultation in Cable's face; as if he is on top of things once more
- We bring Klute along street, and into the Brownstone
- Klute climbs the stairs to Bree's apartment -- knocks
He waits
No answer
He calls once -- Bree
No answer
He starts downstairs again -- then turns back, unlocks the door himself, enters
'  - The room is still disordered
Bree and Frank Ligourin look at him, silently
Bree has been assembling armfuls of dresses to carry away with her
Frank sits nearby in a chair
Klute smiles a little -- almost apologetically
'm always getting surprises
Bree doesn't answer
She sets the armload of dresses over the back of a chair, moves aside to get others
Frank smiles cautiously, ruefully
Then -- (') don't want you to do this
He still doesn't extract an answer
She returns with other dresses
(') Please
said  don't want you to do this
(tight, small) Trask said  should move
Let's not make a thing of it
He continues to look at her; she continues to gather possessions
Then trying to smile, to deal with it casually -- (') Look, too much is going on here
'm moving in with another girl, that's all
Just for a while
(helpfully) That's right
This other girl's got a very big apartment, big, plenty of room
(then) Look, it's not necessarily how it looks, right
It's -- He thinks better of continuing
Klute looks from him back to Bree
He speaks gravely, spacing his words -- unable to speak any faster
No
Please
Not with this son of a bitch
Frank rises, both nervous and offended -- but dealing with Klute as between civilized men
Smiling
Klute, let's handle it like grownups
mean we're all grown up now, right
(ventures forward) -- we all respect each other, you know what  mean
--  respect you, Bree respects you -- you could say, it just didn't work out between you and she
But you got to respect her too -- you know, her best interests, best for her -- Klute hits him, pursues, recovers, and starts to beat him
thickly descends the side of Frank's face, as he struggles away
Bree is screaming
Bree grabs at him from behind
He thrusts her off
But it allows Frank to break away through the still-open door
Klute pursues
- Frank clatters down a stairs as Klute arrives in the doorframe, and as Bree, behind Klute, screams -- No
Klute is restrained -- restrains himself
Frank has faced around on the stairs, still bleeding extravagantly from his torn scalp
Earnestly -- Hey, 'm gonna get you dropped
Klute start's out after him -- Frank vaults away down the stairs -- we hear him stumbling and running -- Klute faces sharply around into the apartment
'  - She is running away from him again, to a corner of the apartment, fumbling at a sewing basket
He starts in, after her
(indistinctly) Please -- She swings about as he overtakes her, holding a pair of scissors -- simply and transcendently terrified
She strikes at him, slashing his forearm
He and she stand in absolute silence
He looks down at the stain of blood spreading through the fabric of his jacket sleeve
Then he turns out of the room and down the stairs
'  - Klute comes out of door -- goes down steps to his own apartment
passerby stops him for directions and doesn't seem to notice the blood on his sleeve
Klute goes into his apartment
' :  - Bree is in the middle of dialing the phone
Her hands are shaking; she misdials -- holds down the receiver for a moment then starts again
' :  - Klute stands in silence for a moment or two -- then takes rather more note of his forearm
(Not urgently but practically; it behooves him to stop bleeding
) He turns toward the bathroom, pulling his jacket off with the other hand
' :  - Bree speaks to the phone, trying to make a simple point, trying to keep her voice even
-- until he gets back
(beat) Yes  heard you,  understand that
said 'm going to come over, 'll wait until he gets back
She hangs up before the other party can object in detail -- takes up her purse and goes out, not even closing the door behind her
' : :  - Klute has knotted a hand-towel around his forearm, now uses teeth and fingers to pull the ends tight
Then -- intending to clean up -- he takes up a washcloth, reaches for the faucet -- '  - Bree comes out of door - goes down steps - hesitates in front of Klute's apartment struggling with the question of whether to knock
pulls back to reveal we are watching her through the windshield of a car in the parking lot across the street
pulls back further to reveal the back of Cable's head as he sits in the car watching her
Bree starts to knock on Klute's door but stops herself and walks down the street
Cable's head moves out of the shot
We hear the sound of the car door opening and closing
Through the windshield we see Cable cross in front of the car and start to follow Bree down the street
' : BATHRO0M:  - Klute finishes mopping up
He turns back out of the bathroom and answers it
Hello
(listens, then soberly - ) Trask,  don't get that
:  - Bree is about a quarter block away from the Brownstone now, hurrying
She waves in the direction of a cab, misses it, continues on
We -- :  - Cable stands looking after her, hesitates over choice of action, decides to follow
: :     - We establish the distance between them -- Cable 100 or so feet behind her, unnoticed by her, maintaining about the same pace, not -- at this point -- trying to overtake (perhaps waiting for less populated surroundings) We    -- ' :  - Klute continues his phone conversation, short spoken
Who told you, his secretary
(listens) Has someone checked his hotel
He always stays at the -- (then) 'll look around, 'll call you back
He hangs up
First he checks out the windows (but - if we want to be accurate - from mid room, without directly approaching the windows themselves)
Then he secures a pistol from his jacket (and folds the jacket itself over his arm to conceal it, as a matter of public decorum), and goes on out
:  - Klute's manner, over the next few minutes, exhibits an absolute, untheatrical, care and competence man -- Cable -- may in fact be hiding here somewhere to kill him
He sets about checking the likely places -- first of all the lower hallway, then the stairwell itself, moving steadily unalarmedly up
At the top he notes -- but still without main concern that Bree's door is open
He calls ahead -- Bree -- ' :  - He enters, puzzles, starts checking around (quite thoroughly; she might be hiding from him)
We -- : ;    - Bree moves past  , through one of those temporary pedestrian passageways
Behind her, nearer than before we see the
- Klute comes quickly back downstairs, back into his room, takes up the phone
Through the still-open door we watch him begin dialing -- then   -- ' ()  - Bree sits isolated on the waiting-room couch
She may have been here for fifteen minutes -- or an hour
She turns the pages of a magazine -- one handed, without even lifting it from the coffee table, with an absolute lack of interest, a mechanical gesture
We hear  approaching directly toward where we are watching Bree sit
(
) Mrs
Daniel -- - Bree looks up in a kind of frozen terror, as the Secretary smiles nicely -- lovingly down at her
--  have to close up now
Leave your name and number with his message service, Mrs
Daniel, and why don't you just go home and wait until he -- No
Well  have to close up now
Look -- could  use your phone
Yes indeed
Look
almost killed my -- almost killed someone
(the same tone, completely) Well 'm certain Doctor Spangler will want to talk with you; excuse me
Bree moves to the desk and telephone
But we move with the Secretary as she moves into Spangler's inner office and switches out the lights (establishing  : dusk now) and as we hear,
, the sound of  and '  -- (
) Is Mr
Faber there
(beat) Mr
Faber Senior
: ' :  - () Mr
Faber's phone buzzes; he picks it up
Yes
(then, glancing about) Bree
() :    - () (haltingly) -- 'm --  just have to talk to someone
'm just a little way across town -- ,   () Yes - yes dear, yes -- maybe half an hour, sure, yes
He hangs up
An ancient stirring, a kind of triumph
He glances about, then tightens his tie
Then it comes to him, after all -- he takes note of himself -- he leans forward against his desk and rubs his forehead with old bony fingers
We '  -  () on phone
Trina, will you call me if you hear from, her
Will you check other people she might call
Yeah, if it wasn't trouble  wouldn't ask vou
He hangs up, immediately starts to dial again, then pauses to check a list he's laid out by the telephone
While he's doing this, his
(') Yeah
(then) Nothing yet, Trask; 'm going down the list
've tried Spangler's office and Spangler's home;  just get his message service
'll keep-- (interrupted -- listens -- then -- grimly) may have steered Cable that way
told him Bree was dealing for me, for Jane McKenna's book
Have you found any -- He is interrupted again -- Trask wasting no words on his end of things -- nods once -- (') Yeah
-- and depresses the receiver just long enough to clear the connection, and starts dialing again -- We   -- -  () Quitting time
As Bree enters from street level, employees are coming down the stairs, pushing past her
She continues up on until at one point -- one more officious or more communicative than the others informs her -- Lady, it's closing up there
What
We're closing up, quitting time, Fabers
(unsurely) have an appointment with Mr
Faber
Oh, yeah
He lets her pass, glances after her like the others, continues on his way
:    - () Bree arrives at the head of the stairs -- as still others press past her on their way down -- and comes more or less directly up against the thickset She is packing her purse, preparing to depart, looks somewhat challengingly at Bree -- who sees no way to avoid the issue
have an appointment with Mr
Faber
In there
(turns, bawls) Mr
Faber -- Bree goes on nervously in the direction indicated, toward -- : stands bending over a bench with back to camera, conferring with another man as Bree approaches -- looking to us, as to her, exactly like his father
We hear the Receptionist's repeating -- (') (
) (') Mr
Faber -- As Bree nears him, he straightens and turns -- a much younger man
Bree stops short, recognizing the error
Yes
'm sorry -- Mr
Faber Senior
(calmly) My father went home about fifteen minutes ago; he wasn't feeling too good
She has already started away
He calls after her evenly -- (') Can  help you
She looks back quickly, smiles nervously -- It wasn't important
But we hold on him for a moment as she continues out of scene -- until he turns away to other matters
Then -- : , Bree returns toward Receptionist, awkwardly -- Did Mr
Faber leave a message for me or anything
Mr
Faber Senior
Bree Daniel
Oh,  thought that was for tomorrow
The Receptionist riffles through a stack of assorted envelopes -- hands one out to Bree -- and promptly takes her way off
Out
Bree starts to open the envelope then and there -- but continue to move past her
She seeks a more private place
Bree shelters herself out of sight from everyone else -- though we continue to hear ,
and continue to maintain the sense of other presences
We see her open the envelope -- : , She finds nothing inside but money -- bills totaling fifty dollars
We see her looking for a message, finding nothing
It comes to her slowly that she's been paid off and avoided
She bites her lips in pain
She pushes back out of hiding -- -- back to the reception area again
(By now this immediate scene has emptied, though we catch sight of a figure or two at scene-start, moving through the background, and continue to hear an occasional or
) Bree looks about for someone -- then scouts for a pencil, finds one in a desk (or bench) drawer, starts to readdress the envelope (to direct it back to Mr
Faber)
Then she breaks off from that, takes up a  instead, dials -- waits -- then -- Bree Daniel
Has he called in yet
Well if he does, 'm at -- (reads phone) -- two seven eight, three one hundred, and  guess  can wait here five minutes; then 'll try from somewhere else
(impatiently) Just tell him Bree Daniel; he knows who
She hangs up, goes back to readdressing the envelope
are approaching in her direction
She glances up apologetically
(') Mr
Faber,  just wanted to leave this for your father, and wondered if you'd -- She pauses -- Cable hastens toward her along a lane of garments
In this brief glimpse a ludicrous and terrifying figure -- a noise, a gesticulation (actually the gesture is arms out, palms downward, intended as a quieting gesture; and the hissing noise is intended as a shushing)
Bree cries out, turns to run -- (') Someone -- -- as we immediately, even as she's turning, -- ' :  -  () Klute speaks quietly but with terrible urgency into the phone (dealing evidently with an ethically skittish message service at the other end)
Did she leave a number
(beat) This is a police call; don't make me take time to prove it
Did she leave a number
What is the number
(beat) What is the number
-- -  () Cable and Bree
They are at some remove from the site of Cable's first appearance; there are other evidences of time-lapse
Cable's manner is that of slightly-strained patience -- a civility -- an attempt now and then to smile
Bree watches his every slight gesture, quivers to make a break for it, tries throughout to buy time
Can't we talk together reasonably, just -- ordinarily
(beat) know you're expecting some kind of -- extravagant behavior, but believe me -- do you believe me
-- Yes -- all right -- -- We can talk -- -- Yes
All right, then, an ordinary matter
'm a quite well off man, have a -- position to respect would feel personally uncomfortable to be connected with a -- certain kind of woman, 'm sure you understand
Do you
Well 'd like to buy Jane McKenna's book
He looks at her discerningly
She seems not to have followed his exposition
He tries patiently to clarify it
(') Her black book, Jane McKenna's, her list of -- of persons
was told you're negotiating for it on behalf of -- The  , an explosive noise
Bree startles
It has been put on night-ring, to sound all over the loft, and the noise is deafening
But -- the most bizarre element is Cable's absolute lack of response to it
It rings and rings as he talks and talks -- in the same expository tone as before, without raising his voice
It drowns out most of his words -- at most we catch only odd phrases of all the following -- but he seems not to hear it any more than the clamor of other things torturing his soul
(') That was what Klute told me -- you were negotiating for him to buy that list
And 'm in a position to pay a good deal more for it than he can
Do you understand
'd like you to acquire it on my -- (beat) Miss Daniel, do you not understand
(beat) Miss Daniel,  can't tell whether you understand me
(beat - still reasonably) Is this something Klute just invented
Is this a trap for me, Miss Daniel; does Klute know about me
He turns and lifts a phone (one of the extension phones situated around the loft) -- though up to now he's given no evidence of even hearing the ringing
He just stands holding the phone for a time, then lowers it back on the receiver
With a sort of absolute quiet -- (') You have no idea what 'm talking about
Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- could make a phone call
No, you're frightened, you're pretending
Well -- Klute knows about me then
Does everybody know, can you tell me
Yes
Then it doesn't matter what  do any more, does it
Pause
Then he shudders slightly
(') You people know nothing about pain
We   -- -  () We see Klute -- probably in  -- running along street
He tries for a cab -- misses it -- halts the next by expedient of cutting bodily in front of it
The Driver starts to lean out to object
Klute mashes him back inside, enters the cab
We -- -  () , the two : ,
They are somewhat separated -- Cable has gone to look down from one of the arched windows of the loft, while Bree remains in place
She is a prisoner, we can suppose -- when we cut closer we'll see her eyes continually shifting, her mind calculating her chances -- but he hasn't molested her
He bears her no animus at this point
His manner is rather quiet, undetermined
He feels some relief that the thing is, in effect, over -- and some puzzlement about what to do (with either her or himself) now
He returns toward her
: , Nearing her again, he gestures several times, apologetically, seeking words
've got no idea what  shall do
He happens too close; she can't avoid shrinking
(') 'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, 'm not
Will you let me go then
He seems not to have heard the request
He sits for a moment
An intellectual interest, a curiosity
(Meanwhile, perhaps, we see her starting to slip her shoes off, in hopes of running
) It puzzles me so badly
've done terrible things but  can't consider myself a terrible man
've killed three people and 'd still want to say it was accident, do you see
(tries again, slowly) If you'll let me go  could tell them what -- (unhearing, resumes) Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna
Then  suppose it was the -- the contempt  saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me
Within the Company
endured that as long as could, do you see
'm sorry, 'm just frightened
Yes
Excuse me Miss Daniel
said yes,  see
(doubtingly) Oh no,  don't think -- Tell me
'll listen
(pause) just want you to tell me
He rises, approaches her -- apparently taken in, credulous, grateful, wondering -- You're willing to listen
You want me just to keep talking
He hits her
(') That's what you do, isn't it; you make a man feel accepted
That's what you all do
Your stock in trade a man's weakness
He hits her again
(') Why don't you ask for mercy
My God, what mercy has anyone given me
-   -  () ( ) -  () Klute has gun out - as he carefully makes his way across the roof
Man in hotel window across street holding drink - watches him with amused curiosity
Klute spots entrance to stairway
:  -  () Klute goes downstairs to back entrance of Faber loft
He slips inside
He hears -- a stirring of feet and indistinct impact sounds, a murmur of voices (but all quite muted, undramatic)
He maneuvers through lanes of garments, trying to gain a line of sight
He understands what's going on, strains to intervene, but can't disclose himself
At a point, he drops to hands and knees, slides underneath the garment racks, drawing closer to Cable, trying to gain position
We intersperse his progress with further Bree-Cable fragments, as for instance -- : , You're a person of no value, you have no value -- , Klute works his way steadily closer -- under steadily increasing pressure, as the pursuit and beating continue as ,
Even close at hand the noises are ambiguous -- the clatter of footsteps, grunts, a slap of flesh -- rather than distinct
Once or twice we hear ' clearly enough to make out words -- (') -- Is that contempt
Is it
(then) No, 'm the one who feels contempt
-- and once or twice a  from Bree
Klute tries to gain aim -- , -- but Cable is too close upon her, and they are too steadily in motion
Klute moves on -- moves on -- gains position -- springs
Cable catches the sound, whirls, screams -- Klute closes with him, knocks loose Cable's pistol - contends for it again, knocks it loose again
-- under --
, Cable breaks loose, backs a step -- backs another step -- and then, turns and runs unhesitant against one of the windows, exploding it outward with him, both frame and glass
:  -  () We see the body tracing its quick path down the dark side of the building
('
) - () : '  -  () The sound of  a little
: ,  -  () Klute turns from looking down, moves to where Bree kneels on the floor
He hunkers down
In a gentle-enough , but matter-of-factly withal -- as if to a child -- Come on
(pause) Come on
(Note: also shoot in , without dialogue, with full up
) Then we   -- '  - is packing to leave
We follow him about as he carries clothing from closet and bureau, folds it into his suitcase on the table
We hear the familiar  on the stairs
Bree's
He lets her in, keeps on about his business
His expression is sober; hers is quite tentative
Hi
He doesn't at least expel her
She ventures in, sits on the table, swings her heels, watches him pack
His arm impairs him
At length -- got a call from Ross this morning
Cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends
They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there
They've notified his wife
Oh
(pause; then sharply --) Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy
Mm
You're going back
Mm
Pause
She compresses her lips, slips down from the table, starts smartly out of the room
(') Wait
She returns and sits on the table again, waits
But Klute doesn't seem about to say anything more -- goes on packing
Well suppose  hadn't come downstairs
Would you just have folded up and sneaked away
(slowly) No
was going to come up wanted to ask you to marry me
(pause) You wanted to, or you are
am
You could at least look at me
He complies, stands and looks, folding a necktie
But now she finds she has to look away
Somewhat brokenly -- (') Look -- yes
mean thanks, but -- don't you think we better be realistic
About what
Look at me
'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God 'd tear your heart out
don't think so
He resumes packing, continues through the following
How can you not think so
You know the things  can do
(unclearly) They don't scare me any more
What
Doesn't scare me
think we could handle it
Thereafter he guards his silence, staunchly goes on packing, as she comes at the thing from various sharp angles
Please, 'm a city person
'm sure it's just as good as here but 'm a city person, that's all,  am
(pause) Hell  know what it's like
was in Jersey once: the frogs go bra-a p all night
(pause) What'im  supposed to do
Mend your socks and sing in the church choir
(pause, choking) ) Do you not believe  love you
'm honestly, honestly just -- He has almost finished packing -- returns toward the suitcase with the tin  and electric , tries to fit them in as conversation continues
(') Look, why should it be yes or no
Can't we keep it going and see mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see
People do that, that's realistic
(bitterly) You don't believe that either, do you
Why can't you see my side
Can you use these
He sets the fan beside her, hands her the clock
She holds it in her lap, numbly
He's packed -- closes various drawers, leaving in good order -- snaps the suitcase shut, lifts it stiffly down from the table
She remains sitting
Can  carry something for you, to the car
(he shakes his head) Will you kiss me
No
'm sore
He moves to the door, pauses, half-smiles -- (') Well -- She smiles back
He goes
We hear the entryway door opening and closing
She slips down off the table
We   -- - Klute is, let's say, about seventy feet on his way when she appears at the front door, calls after him
Hey
He turns around and stops
He walks slowly back to her
: , He arrives in proximity to her
Then the following events in more or less the following order: He looks at her inquiringly
She responds by sitting down, plunk, on the grubby front step of the Brownstone
Having stood for some time -- during which she has offered only twitching motions of her hands -- he sets down the suitcase
Having set down the suitcase, but derived no answer, he reaches out one arm, and leans against the building front
She nearly arrives at the level of statement
Fretfully, indecisively -- Oh heck -- (pause) Oh heck -- Then, as a man not to be dallied with, he picks up the suitcase again
She looks at him strickenly, but it doesn't precipitate her into speech
He puts it down again
And then -- then, after all, goddamit, he reaches out, grabs her wrist, and simply hauls her along, suitcase in one hand, Bree in the other
As she yanks, shouts, struggles -- (') haven't decided yet
(beat) haven't decided yet
(beat) haven't decided yet
