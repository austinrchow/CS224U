On the stage,
is speaking
is a forensic psychologist
Behind her is a projected diagram: , , , ,  , , , and - which she can point to with a laser pointing device
We see her from a considerable distance
the back of the balcony
Her voice is crisp and assured
Our society creates these socially and psychically disenfranchised men, and their revenge on society is terrible
They are hard to catch
They are "the nice guy next door," their employers -- if they work at all -- find them quiet and uncomplaining
Early abuse and rejection have taught them passivity
Only in their violent fantasies do they feel alive
What they seek in their frenzied assaults on their victims is relief from passivity
For these men, ten minutes relief is worth far more than the life of another human being
Torture, the pain they inflict, the screams of the victim, are all part of the ritual that gives them a brief respite from their own psychic pain
And then the depression, the forgetting, the feeling of sadness and despair begins the cycle all over again
Like addicts seeking their drug, Albert DeSalvo, Bianchi and Buono, Berkowitz, Dahmer, Bundy -- they seek out their next victim
During the second half of this speech, the eye of the camera has moved slowly forward until it settles just behind the balcony railing
: The cycle is endless until they are caught
And they are caught by chance -- they run a red light, and a body is in the trunk
leaking pipe brings a plumber to a basement where they is the smell of death
Her eyes have come to rest on the spot of the camera eye in the balcony
Her voice chokes off
She stares
' : Sitting in the front row of the balcony, a  - (  ) leans forward, resting his tattooed arms on the railing
He smiles intimately at
cuts her eyes to the left
She sees: Backstage, an overweight  in plain clothes
Instantly alert to ' alarm, he jumps up, comes within an inch of exposing his presence to the audience
, in the wings on the other side of the stage, also springs to attention
' eyes follow '
Their :    -  -  is no longer there
Can she believe her eyes
Resumes: At any time, right now, as you listen, the  estimates there are 30 to 35 serial killers stalking their victims
The serial killer is a plaque that must be addressed not only by the law, but by science
Florida spent eight million dollars to execute Ted Bundy
It would have been better spent building a forensic penal facility devoted to research
Once again her eyes fix on the balcony to reassure herself that the smiling man is not there
Confined for life, without parole, and subjected to scientific study, these men's lives might finally, in some small measure, educate and thereby protect society
Thank you
Applause as Helen warily checks for the
They are carefully casing the crowd
: : The crowd is breaking up
walks  to the ladies' room
People reach to shake Helen's hand; she copes as well as she can with her fear '
: '  - , clearly embarrassed, pokes his head in and looks around
Under one stall he sees a woman's
He hastily ducks back into  and signals an okay to Helen
Before the door behind her closes, we see the  prepare to stand guard outside
walks past the stall with the high heels to a stall several doors down
: And a tattoo that the cop missed seeing on one of the ankles
The shoes are kicked off
The feet disappear from view as , a few stalls away, methodically places toilet paper around the seat before raising her skirt
faint noise makes her freeze
Her hand reaches for the door
She is just able to unlock it, but no more, before a Like a lariat it falls over ' head and is violently yanked tight
She kicks at the stall door
: , leaning against outside door smoking, hears the clang of metal as the stall door bangs open
He reacts
- The -  is struggling to secure the rope around a hook inside his own stall
(o
s
) (o
s
) Doctor Hudson
Are you okay in there
The  lets slip a little slack
' fingers, thrusting between the rope and her neck, get just enough air for  to let out a strangled little scream
: , not certain what to do about the ambiguous sounds from inside
Women stands nearby, inhibiting him for a split second from going in the Ladies' Room door
Now there is more  from inside
- steps into the room, gun down
Over the ' shoulder we see  hanging in open booth, her hand fluttering at her throat
She has one slippery shoeless foot on the toilet seat
takes a couple of steps forward
Behind ' back we see a broom closet door opening
' :  : The , taken from behind
In a second, his throat is slit
In a gush of  blood, he falls, his gun still in his hand
-  standing over the fallen , smiling at '   ,
The violent contractions in his fingers cause the gun to go off
, the sound reverberating against the tile walls
The audience and   react to the gunshots
, her eyes bulging, struggling against the rope
: '  -   - As , in bed, bolts up from the nightmare, her hands try desperately to pull the dream rope from her neck
She is now pale, her hair is dirty, there are deep circles under her eyes
This is a woman in the throes of a breakdown
Andy
Andy
She races through this   ( - ) to study opening off a hall
She looks in, gasping for breathing
- The room is neat -- nobody there
(We will later see that it is used on and off by her computer, Andy
) whimpers in frustration; she is alone as she turns back and moves past a  , where she turns on lights and the  flicks on, (
) The sound comes up, loud
She moves on
trying to calm herself with the sound of her own voice
It is October twelfth, 1994 in the city of San Francisco, California, , the strongest, richest, most stable and happiest country in the world
That is the sole place of life in the universe
Under God
:
Two pills are shaken out into a palm, others scattering from the nervous haste
:   Watching herself in  mirror as she tosses down the pills, gulps water
She regards her haggard reflection with a certain detachment
Good God
What happened to you
She barks a rueful laugh
we are seeing a woman will herself from near-hysteria to relative calm
: As she exits the bathroom
And moves into her
She pours herself a brandy and stands before two computers
Of the side-by-side computer screens, one is blank
The other shows a chess setup
Flashing on the bottom of the screen comes a command
'It's almost seven
Make a goddam move
' She studies the chess set-up for a moment, then makes a move
She has not even hit the Keyboard of the other computer before  sends another message
'Lousy move
Not really into this game, Helen
Let's drop it
've got a feeling about you
Let's meet
Like a date
' types the following to
''m a terrible date
'd mess up your life
' 'Another romantic dream gone all to hell
' 'Maybe it's better to just dream on; avoid the disappointments of life
Come on, move
' She pushes a button on the remote, and we see the window curtains open
We see that the -shirt  wears says "Shrinks '' Us
"  She crosses to the window with her glass of cognac, looks out
: sweeping view of the bay, and across to Marin County
The morning sun is dispelling the last of the night's fog
opens window, puts a hand outside, trying to feel the air, the freedom
Feeling quite restored from the dream horror of the night
,
:   Her hand comes into  and picks up the handset and carries
(carefully) Yes
(listens) You son-of-a-bitch
Son of a bitch
Stiff with fear and rage, she slams down phone
You filthy son of a bitch On the computer screen behind her the Chessmaster makes his move: the computer speaks in its tiny computer voice: (filter) You Queen is in check
Protect your Queen
: of a young woman dressed in a seat suit
It is morning, and she is jogging on a park path
Her hair is in a long braid
She is sweating, breathing heavily, clearly near the end of a satisfactory run
, ' - : - : it is a silhouette of a man's head and torso; centered in the right side of the upper chest, near the shoulder, is a small red circle
Still , are scattered all over the chest, and none in the circle
(
) My third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that
,  ,
Yeah, but she had divine guidance
We now take in the shooter, , and his companion
is a small, deceptively vulnerable looking young woman
She is neat, buttoned down, crisp
appears to be about twenty-five
She is, in fact, thirty-four and a homicide inspector with the rank of sergeant
She is usually dressed in slacks and a loose sweater or an oversize jacket that helps make her appear even smaller and younger than she is
is also in homicide, about twenty-six and junior in authority to
is good-looking, good-humored and laid back
He has a cellular phone attached to his belt
, 'd feel a whole lot safer with Sister Loretta for my backup
Look at this guy: you shredded him
Well, he's dead, he can't hurt me now
The target is rigged; they pull the line that dollies it back to shooting position
It's sloppy shooting
It's in character, Ruben, but unnecessary
And bad for your career
: they cluster nearer the circle
looks at him in surprise
've been practicing
Now can kiss your tummy
hides her smile as she prepares her weapon for her turn
Perp's holding a hostage, the shoulder on his gun hand is gonna be exposed
:    ( ' )
holds her fire
Answer it
'm sure she thinks it is
Aren't you at least interested in which one it is
She's lost her concentration lowered the gun; now as he answers, she raises her gun and aims
(into phone) 'm here, where are you
Heeeeyyy What a surprise
No
On duty, have to call you back
You, too, you too
My God, you made my day
He hits the "end" button
You hit the brachial nerve
The shots make a perfect heart around the circle, inside his looser pattern You're good enough you'll never have to kill anyone
joined the cops to save lives, not waste them
You know,
, when  watch you shoot,  realize 've got a little problem with my stance
could you just move over here and critique my legs
He slaps his thigh where he indicates the trouble might be
She is unloading her weapon
The problem is between your legs
You told your shrink about that
She is unloading and cleaning up
Ruben doing the same
tell my shrink about you Sergeant
tell him you're the top cop of my dreams
Ruben has been gathering up his box of doughnuts, from which he has nibbled during the preceding
he drops them, picks one up off the floor and sticks it in his mouth
(putting away her gear) Don't take that mess in the car
They're on the move; as they go away from us
He's in love with you already
: - They pull up in front of an apartment building in the Pacific Heights section
Patrol cars flank the street, the thick yellow ticker tape "     " is already up
double parks beside a blue-and-white
couple of cars from the media are already there a bulldog of a woman, and her camera crew, waylay and Ruben as they cross the sidewalk
Oh, Christ, the Mouth is already here
She is, with a cameraman with a haircut and smile that speak of a life of orthodontics and dreams of  anchorship
Hey
And there's the Haircut right behind
If she stops short he's gonna be there feet up her ass
(on camera) Inspector, can you
just got here myself, Susan
confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern
Do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city
just got here
Talk to you later
(as they escape behind the barrier tape) What the hell does she want to do, scare everybody to death
That's her job
Jesus, Quinn is here already
, a splenetic Irishman, a politician, Chief of Homicide stands at the top of the steps leading to the front door
As they climb up toward him
been waiting
have to do everything myself
Photo, crime tech, the Coroner are already inside
The Landlady calls it in; tenant is not answering when called, she sticks her head in, sees the body, uses the deceased's telephone to call 911
Otherwise nothing disturbed
It's all yours, kid
'll take care of the Mouth and the Haircut
and Ruben enter
-  - Four uniformed cops stand in the hall securing the premises; at the back one cop stands by a stunned and tearful woman chain-smoking (the Landlady)
(to cop) That the Landlady
(to Ruben) You wanna talk to her, Ruben
(back to cops) Who was first on the scene
Mike answers her question by answering to Ruben
was
(forcefully) 'm over here
What's your name, Officer
Michael Johnson
You touch anything, Mike
Pick up anything
Use the doorknob don't want to find your prints on anything later and you tell me you forgot to tell me
No
didn't
She glances at him, at the      " '
"  But moves on, as Ruben goes to the Landlady
- The same   we saw jogging, is now dead
Hair still in a long braid
She wears only a blouse, open and pushed back
She is on her back in the bathtub, with one leg dangling over the side of the tub
The effect is slightly posed, but casual, relaxed
Bending over her is , the Coroner, taking in the scene
Foreground, Doc reads the thermometer
The photographer is finishing up his shots
The room is crowded
Two Coroner's men wait in the doorway, a stretcher standing on end between them;
has to pass between them to come down to the body
' ; ,
: (
) Liver and rigor are telling me about eight hours
'm gonna take her out now if it's alright
'm seeing ligature marks on her neck here, petechial hemorrhages in her eyes
Strangled
You got it
Same as the other two
(
) Tell whoever she can't come to the phone, she's all tied up
Nobody laughs
That's real old material, get a new writer
She picks up the phone after the second ring, holding it in tissue someone hands her
Hello
(extremely cheerful) Hello
This is Geena Martinez, how are you this morning
What is this about, Ms Martinez
'm conducting a telephone survey to determine whether you're satisfied with your insurance on your personal valuables
gently hangs up the phone
She has been looking at the Dead Woman
They pick up where they left off
He used something soft, like a stocking or a bathrobe tie
Anybody find it
No answer as the Coroner's men crowd in beside
to begin lifting the body out of the tub
takes one last look into the dead woman's eyes
Cover her up, please
- Ruben still talking to the Landlady and taking notes
approaches Mike
takes him aside
Mike
Why don't you tell me what's bothering you
Mike is acutely uncomfortable
Whatever it is, 'm gonna find out and sooner is a hell of lot better than later
Well, there's something missing in there
There was something around her neck when  came in there, but it's gone now
Who came in after you
Lieutenant  Quinn
She seems relieved
Brightly: Well, it's all right, then, Mike
Thanks
- In the door,
appears, looking out thoughtfully over the scene; Ruben appears behind her
The photographer is coming out
(to Photographer) Get me good faces on the crowd here
Get a couple of harness bulls to grab anybody who starts to run
Don't tell your Grandmother how to suck eggs
only been doing this work since your junior prom, darling
But
is already on to other things
: '   - ' The door opens and Helen looks out, wasted from cognac and Xanax
She looks for the newspaper and sees it with a look of despair
' The newspaper lies there, out of reach
As she stretches out her foot toward the paper, can't reach it
As she moves out into the hall her agoraphobia manifests itself: ; --
The newspaper seems further away
She drops to her knees and tries to lean out further into the hall
The floor seems to melt and roll in waves toward her
The newspaper melts like a Dali watch
sweats
She lies flat on her stomach and crawls toward the newspaper
and with a supreme effort grabs it and squirms back inside
- As she slams the door shut on the hall, and sits gasping for breath
After a moment she can bring herself to look at the newspaper
: (
) Damn fools
: '  - is watching a portable  screen with profound distrust
Onscreen is
continues to stonewall the public
Now
There is a knock, but before  can respond,
enters
You messed with the scene
Shut up
He and
both listen to
third Bay Area woman has been strangled, but the police continue to deny that this is the work of one killer
Lt
Thomas Quinn declares that the murders will be treated as unrelated crimes, unless new evidence
,
You messed with the evidence
tagged the goddamned stocking
It ain't lost
We're sequestering that evidence
That's the trap some son of a bitch is going to fall into
Am  in charge of this thing
Or not
said you were
Then  decided what evidence we choose to sequester
(a beat here) Okay
What do you want to sequester
The stocking around the neck
long moment of looking at each other
Then
You didn't say serial killer and didn't say serial killer
Right
(not satisfied she really means it) This is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a Festival of Love
The Mayor and Chamber of Commerce don't want  announcing killers on the loose
Right
And she starts to go
We're gonna have a bunch of clapped out old hippies blissing on the Grateful Dead
Sleeping in the park, smoking dope and sticking tulips up their ass
(exiting) Good
: - This large room is very busy, many officers at work
Known sexual offenders have been rounded up
False confessors add to the crowd
Detectives who are not dealing with these people are making and taking calls
At this desk, a tall intense looking Detective, , interrogates a false confessor, a man who looks like a businessman
Harvey,  don't want you in here no more, making false statements
They are not false
We pay for city government like this, you don't even care about the truth
killed her in the bathtub
Why
Because she was dirty, a dirty girl
How
How did you do it, Harvey
With a knife
Good guess, but not good enough
Get the fuck outta here
He has stood as
passes coming from Quinn's office
He falls into stride with her through the crowded scene
He is sweaty and sniffs his armpits as a matter of general hygiene checkup
What am  wasting my time with this shit for
Because it's your job, that's all
Not what  meant; why me (cutting) Maybe it's something you did in this life, Nikko
It has the flavor of a spoiled intimacy, an unfinished argument
He pantomimes she got him with a poison dart
Got me
That really hurt
You
Ruben joins them; Nikko stifles and turns away
(to Ruben) Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers
It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them
No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody
They are approaching ' desk
is on phone
Pachulski is looking at
, grinning
(into phone) Yes, ma'am,  know
You can't talk her right now
because she's busy, she's all tied up
(sotto to
) Deep Throat's back
He hits the speaker phone
This is the third one
You've got a serial killer here
When are you going to start warning people
(whispering) Fourteen calls from this broad
And she ain't stupid
signals for  to trace the call
Takes the phone, switches off the speaker
Who is this
'  - on phone Who is this
Inspector Halloran, Homicide
'm in charge here
(amused) Ask her about the moon bike
'm really interested in your ideas
The moon bike
What is that
What is wrong with you people
The first two,  thought he might be on a lunar cycle because they were 28 days apart, but obviously not
This new one is only two weeks
Pachulski is delighted at the joke he's played on
,
not so much
Gigi signals they're getting it
(cont'd) You want to joke about moonbikes
No, ma'am
This is no joke
And neither is tying up telephone lines to police with crank calls while people in trouble are trying to get through for help
You're calling me a crank
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am
Do you know any of the victims
think this is number three
(over her) That's an opinion, not evidence
Gigi hands her a slip of paper
reads it
glares at Pachulski who is still laughing
knows the name on the slip of paper
(covers the phone) Helen Hudson
Get Ruben back here
As she turns back to the phone
: '   - , now wearing slippers and shorts with the same -shirts she slept in, is standing behind the living room curtains looking down at the street
She hears a code knock, then a key turns in the lock
She moves to greet  her assistant and friend
is laden down with groceries and mail
immediately reaches a hand up to touch his face
Where were you
Don't tell me
It's just under seventy, right
The sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh
Would you please get your hands off my face, Tallulah
What happened to the newspaper
He withdraws a popsicle from the bag, offers it to her
When she rejects it, he takes it for himself
got it myself
couldn't wait
Well
Aren't we the daring one
What's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make Doctor Helen set foot outside her door
The antenna is gone off her car again
had no music, all the way to the market
Let me find a garage for it
They're in the kitchen area; Andy unpacking stuff
expensive goodies
've told you:   can't afford to garage it
Are you kidding
You buy enough gourmet junk every week
most of which rots to garage a fleet of stretch limos
had the dream again
(beat) And  got another call
This time he spoke
He said "You and me, you and me
" little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for
Forget it
He whispered, but it was him know it was him
Andy now stops to address this seriously
He can't phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you
Did you give him an approval
Andy
When a three-year-old says there's a monster under the bed, you don't say 'forget it'
You look under the bad
(beat) 'm three years old
Call the prison
Her fear is so palpable, she is so nakedly vulnerable it breaks his heart
He puts his arms around her
Oh God
'm really crazy
When was the last time you washed your hair
(shaky, but trying) Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure
Monsieur Andy can smell your coiffure
And guess what else
He pats her thighs
she walks to the window as he talks
Cellulite
What do you say blindfold you and take you to the gym
Aerobics with housewives
Andy
Andy has heard this tone before:  panic attack alert
Here we go again
In a parked car a man is reading a newspaper that hides his face
Behind him is parked a slightly beat up red Saab
You parked right behind him
The one  noticed earlier
didn't say anything,  thought he'd leave
Just take a look
Oh my God
Help
' But earlier, he was staring up here
Please , Andy
Okay
You win
'Dirty Harry' coming up
leaves the apartment
'  - The heavy old industrial door is pushed slightly open, peers out, sees: crosses behind the car and then sneaks back, coming up to Driver's side window, surprising the Driver
:  '
Excuse me, but would you mind explaining why you're watching the lady upstairs
None of your fucking business
Usurping ' aggressive attitude,  leans his face close to ' window
Listen, asshole, 've got a gun
grabs  by the collar and yanks his head inside the car
With the other hand he pulls his gun and pushes it up ' nose
hate this
Only kidding
pushes the 'up' button on the window, capturing ' head in a deadlock
Then he opens the door, gets out, slams door, forcing the squawking  into a helpless frisk position
We   scream, (
)
Ignoring this, begins to frisk
,   , at window, shouting
'm calling the police
: '   - Andy enters, followed by Ruben and
, who holds up her badge to Helen
Investigators Halloran and Goetz apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog
(trying to defuse) 'm okay
really kind of enjoyed it
Uncomfortable silence for a beat as they try to take in what's happening, who's who and what's what
Helen is confused, fighting back fear
(trying to communicate here) Ring the gong, he goes
Poor impulse control
Is he out
Who
(to Andy) If he's not out, why are they here
Because of your phone calls
What calls
haven't made any calls
(to distract) Are you staying long
Shall  shut the door
Make your coffee
Make the beds
(to Helen) You talked to me
Do you remember
The two women measure each other, Helen struggling to control herself
beat
You were the one that talked about moonbikes and called me a crank
Oh God, am (to Andy) Make them some coffee
(to
) Halloran, is it
Investigator Goetz
had a crank call myself-- he said
(a moment of real fear) thought it might be Daryll Lee Cullum
thought he might be out of prison
Daryll Lee Cullum
don't think so
If he's escaped we'd have the National Guard, cops'd be crawling through sewers
You'd have a guard on your front door
(looking around) want to tell you it's a great honor to meet you and talk to you
You don't admire me
No police admire me
got one of you killed
Why don't you say right out what you're here for
You called us , Doctor Hudson
Yes,  did
Poor impulse control
The accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of the same man, but you kept announcing they were unrelated
You'll never catch him that way
regards her for a moment
(to Andy) Sugar and cream for Goetz;  take mine black
(beat) You're absolutely correct
The politicians don't want panic headlines spoiling the Festival of Love
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then
Would you want to work with us on this
Oh, my God, no
'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, 'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary
never leave this apartment now
Nobody ever comes here
just wanted to get your attention
write and  used to lecture on these crimes, but
'm not competent
think you are
really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours
Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is don't give a fuck
That's the upside of having a breakdown
Well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here
'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts
guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good
Will you go
Andy, make them go
You can't go out lecturing
Tough shit
Women are dying
Where can lay this stuff out
She dumps files of photos, etc
, out on Helen's cocktail table
don't want this
What are they
You called us, Doctor, if you don't want to look at them here, how about downtown
'll drive you down
She pushes the pictures off onto the floor, tries to get up to leave the room
and Ruben are both appalled at the force of what is happening: an all-out panic attack
Andy races t o the kitchen; Ruben tries to help but Helen fights him off viciously, gasping for air
Andy races back in with a      ' She hyperventilates into the bag
'  until she faints
Andy deals with it like an everyday event, treating her very gently
(to Ruben) Now look what you did
What did  do
You threatened to drive her downtown
She has agoraphobia
Fear of what
Open space
She hasn't been out of this apartment in three years didn't used to think it was real
He's making her comfortable
We'll get the paramedics
Oh, God, uniforms, more stress
Let her sleep
It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark
(rocking the unconscious Helen) We know, don't we, Princess
(to them) Give her a couple of hours
know about this
starts to gather up the pictures and files
She is angry and disgusted
Tell her we're sorry we bothered her
Hey, no
Leave those here
If you really want her help
mean if you really do, leave them
Let her see them
'll see they're safe
takes in the scene; the now soundly sleeping Helen; Andy sitting over her protectively, the files and photos strewn around
Makes a decision
Tell her to ask for me
She's handing Andy her card
: '   - come out in the street Snotty neurotic bitch
(amused) Classy madonna
Sure
She likes you , Rube
She likes the way you move
She sure as hell isn't in love with me
You came in there with this attitude
(over him) Order Chinese for us and meet me the library
Anything but beef
She jumps in her car, still steaming, leaving Ruben to move to his car
, '
We can  ,     , , ( ) , , ""
: Putting down the phone
Irritated
Shit
: - : it was your feeling after careful evaluation that he was a sexual sadist who satisfied at least four out of ten criteria in the
and Ruben watching videotapes, and eating Chinese takeout
is being interrogated by the  for Daryll Lee Cullum
Helen sure of herself to the point of arrogance, which is her undoing
Yes
Without question
Without question
He only scored 40 percent, four out of ten criteria
Couldn't another expert say he flunked the sexual sadist test
What curve are you marking on, Doctor
The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects
Only part
What else
What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it
He was lying
'Lying
He was lying
'   asked you what you thought, not what he did
thought he was lying
You said, first, he was lying
How do you know that, Doctor
Because people who are suffering from aural hallucinations hear voices in both ears
Daryll Lee told me that Joan of Arc always appeared beside him on his left side and spoke softly in his left ear
Murmur of subdued laughter in court
(emboldened) He took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong
He was not acting on mad impulse
He was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time
(playing causal) What pattern was that
The same as the first time
She catches herself
The
has leapt to his feet, but now tries to sit down as though nothing was happening, but Helen, the Attorney and the
all are clearly disturbed by the line this questioning is taking
The first what
(as she hesitates) Your Honor, she's got this far, think she should finish
don't think this jury should be left wondering where the rest of her statement would lead
agree, Doctor
The first two murders
What first two murders
We don't know about them here, do we
(giving up) He told me he had done two others just like it
When was that
When he was seventeen
And you believed him when he told you he had done that
Yes
believed him
The
is rushing to the bench to argue with the Judge
(
) Yes, 'll accept a call for a mistrial
Evidence of that other crime when the defendant was a juvenile is inadmissible and never should have been heard by this jury
on the  screen, There was no sperm
The same as the firs two
Definitely a serial
(seeing  on video) What are you looking at that for
Helen Hudson
Work the clues
What clues
'm going to work Helen Hudson
Would you step outside, Sergeant
leaves a cautiously silent
Once the door shuts, he turns tape back to 'play
' - 'm telling you
Don't you ever address me publicly in that tone
You'll work what and who tell you to work
Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case
She's the expert
need help
How about  put Nikko on it
That's always your privilege, sir
snorts, starts on his way, then turns back
Sergeant
Yessir
You ever reflect how this big explosion in dead women coincides with the flowering of women's lib
Yessir
have reflected on that, sir
Which explains my gushing deference to you, sir
is somehow cheered by this little exchange
Nikko's looking better by the minute, Inspector
He stomps off
: '   - on couch,  is massaging her neck
Oh, God
must have looked horrible
No, dear
You're at your best with a bag in front of your face
want to die
wouldn't
He'll be back
If you want him
The cute brutal type with handcuffs
Very sexy
grins, and  starts to tickle her, she laughs
You thought he was cute too, didn't you
Admit
admit
now laughing a little too hard
Suddenly the laughter changes to tears
What
What'd  do
Reminded me that  used to be attractive
That men used to want me
You slut No sexy young cop for you unless you shampoo your hair
She clings desperately to him
He rocks her as he would a small child
When are you going to call them
(big beat) About what
Helen looks at it
Andy watches her
can't, Andy
Then, why don't you just die
'm going
They'll find your body years later, the old recluse lady, she ate cat food, ten years of the New York Times, unread, piled on top of the unread mail, the still on
Make up your mind
Live or die
(beat) 'll get coffee
He exits
After a moment fighting her fears, Helen reaches for the file
She opens it and looks at the first picture
She freezes
Panic hangs in the air
Andy answers the phone in the kitchen
(
) Yes
Inspector Halloran, she's going through the material now
(beat) She'll call you
No, she'll be alright, 'll sleep over on the couch in case
But now,  told you, singing like a lark
Hangs up
After a moment Helen bends to her work
: - scanning microfilm newspaper & magazine clips
'  ' Slew police bodyguard in attack on expert witness hears  entering, looks up, gives him a half-smile, returns her attention to the microfilm
Working late
(no response) You're a damn fool
(preoccupied) Oh,  know
"
" "
" You're almost ten years older than he is
turns off the microfilm
The last headline is retained on screen: "    " It's none of my business anymore
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business
You're shitting ion your career
You outrank hi
looks at him at last with wry amusement: he's jealous of Ruben
Well, you outranked me , Nikko
Yeah
And you used that
Used me Don't put yourself down like that
never used you
worked my way up like a marine grunt
Yeah, you did that too
You earned what you got; don't shit on it, that's all 'm saying
(maddeningly) God, you're cute when you're mad
The door opens and  enters, instantly takes in the scene:
sitting in front of a stalled machine, , looming over her
After an awkward beat,  heads for the door
Ignoring , he barks at
Think about it

, who busies herself examining the other tapes
What's wrong with him
He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine
We heard from Doctor Hudson
Nada
Lemme make the call
Honest to God, Ruben
like women like that
Tell it to your shrink

: - , wearing shorts and an open-necked shirt, kneels on the grass, weeding a lush flowerbed
The the back door of the house as a man comes out balancing a tray with drinks
The woman gives the man a dazzling smile, removes her gardening glove and takes a glass
Her husband bends down, gives her a little kiss
She beams
: '   - :  early crime scene photos
, (
) The way he's posed the bodies
he's flaunting his power to do whatever he wants to her
This man
He probably seems perfectly normal
These murders are organized and planned
:
, Helen picks out one picture from the rest
Except for this one
You put that one in to test me
nods, pleased with > :
The victim's body is covered with bruises
But, unlike the others, her face has been covered
(
) Is it an ongoing case
(nods) For months
last October
It was a lover or a husband
Someone close
Somebody who knew her and cared about her
(glancing at Ruben) How do you know that
He felt remorse
He covered her
arranges and rearranges photos like tarot cards
The bodies have been carefully arranged
different positions, but somehow the same
The positions are brutal
yet quite
artful
It's like
a signature
He's proud of his accomplishments
There are early Picassos and late Picassos, but you always recognize the hand
He wants us to recognize his hand
've seen this hand before
what are you hiding
(taken aback) Nothing
Where are the stockings he strangled them with
How did you know they were stockings
(sarcastic) sent Andy out on murder missions
For God's sake -- it's the Boston Strangler, Alber deSalvo
He used their own stockings to strangle them
Tied in a bow-knot
She gets down a file from her bookcase and flops it open to pictures of deSalvo's victims:  they are identical
Somebody is imitating his m
o
Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard
The Boston Strangler, when was that
In the sixties
He's dead -- stabbed to death in prison
Why imitate a dead serial killer
If you knew why, you might know where to look for him
don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush
Now, 've done what you asked me
Work with me
(
) It's good for you
They are startled by his appearance
little unsettling
It's good medicine
little homeopathic cure for the willies
(exhausted) None of you know anything about it
Now go
And Andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them
'm the only friend you've got, darling, and  don't intend to stop doing what  think is good for us
Get out
All of you
Andy helps
and Ruben scoop up the files
You said you don't give a fuck and that's the beauty of a breakdown
This doesn't look like not giving a fuck, you know that
Let's get out of here
- As they leave, Andy is still at the door
(
) (small voice) Andy
Please
Don't you go
'  - Aw, Jesus
The Mouth gets a load of this and we got major headlines around the world
deSalvo redux
The matter, you think they don't teach Latin in Catholic schools
Don't swear at me because we got problems
'm just giving you the news
went to a Catholic school; 'll tell you what they teach
On the knuckles they teach
Who've  got to beat up except the messenger
Does this give us anything to go on
'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo
Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green
Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile
Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling
If they've got a German wife
We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon
(morose) know
Get out here
So
Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information
Or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat
What  love, the big fight, some girl, she drops the quarter on her boyfriend so the bastard spends the night in custody, just to teach him a lesson
We'll get a shitload of those
Another country heard from
(deciding) No
We're keeping it quiet, don't give the bastard the attention he's maybe begging for

The chess game is again in progress

Pleased with herself, she smiles, types, "'m creaming you

' Engrossed in her own chess game, she does not notice the screen until, tense from sitting too long, with waiting for ' move,  begins to stretch her neck and toll her head
Now, out of the corner of her eye, she sees the other screen
Quickly, she clicks on this, and the screen prints out ' "

She's in the office
' The computer glow, the unfinished chess game still up, and the - ' joyful face on the other , , suppressing her fear by sheer will
and Ruben enter with Andy
they look at the face on the computer screen
(this is the only light in the room)
That's the face of the next one he'll kill
She hasn't looked at them or the computer
How do you know that
(can't look at it) Look at the bottom of the screen
You see the icon with the arrow pointing left
Click on that
twice
(      ) expertly maneuvers the mouse and clicks on the icon as instructed
- ,
How did you do that
That computer's wired into He's hacked into her Internet address
He's a hacker
(rocking, rocking) He can get into my computer any time he likes
This is exactly the kind of thing  didn't want to have happen
Can you make a copy we can show on our computers
It's too big a file to copy to a disk
You got a tape backup, yeah, here lemme copy it on tape
Why would he send this to Helen Hudson
It's a game they like to play
Berkowitz -- "Son of Sam" -- hung around the crime scene, talking to the cops
This one's probably watching you , laughing at you
Let me get a little action started here
nods to him to get along
He calls on his cellular phone while simultaneously working the computer
'm going to put a guard on your door
One officer already got killed trying to protect me
Please, just take it all away
Leave me alone
He won't
Look at this
: As they watch, it is replaced by: '
Helen goes to the machine and maneuvers with mouse and keyboard
It's gone
The file's not here
(to Ruben) What did you do
just started it copying to tape, but the tape never ran
It just did that
(respect) He's brilliant
This one is brilliant
We'll show that to
Show what
It's gone
He wrote a self destruct virus into the code, so it would only play until we try to copy it
Then it erased itself
Gone
(beat) Do you remember what you saw
: - , , , ,
For a moment we won't know who Quinn is talking about
He's on the phone calling me like an insurance salesman soliciting my business, for Christ's sake didn't tell him the three most over-rated things in life are young pussy, regular exercise and the Oh, maaaaan
What
talk like a cop, this is the way  talk
can't believe this guy

He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the
"Let me help you
" We could use a little help
With the
there's no such thing as a little help
They bury you with help
Explain to me about this virus, no don't tell me about the virus
Thing is, you saw it, the pictures
They pass through a door into a  where the homicide team sit waiting
goes right into a briefing
We saw it
The unknown target is kneeling, she's gardening
Red hair, high cheekbones, mid- thirties, height  don't know, she's not overweight, she's zofting
She's in front of a house that looks like
: - As she is speaking, her description becomes
as we police cars and an ambulance drawn up (
) the Marina area, there was earthquake damage repair on the house it looked like, a little garden
The light was late afternoon
Say about cocktail hour
He was bringing out drinks, margaritas by the look
So we got a house facing west, on the east side of the street
Full sun, so there's no high trees or buildings, residential both sides
and her crew arrive, leaping out of their van with their equipment, a makeup woman  ' : - and Ruben, Quinn, etc
, trying to calm and/or question the , who is in shock
He is the man we saw bringing drinks
Stupid goddam s-stupid p-poker game
Always have to s-stay until Phil makes a c
comeback
Am stuttering
The husband's voice follows  and others as another leads them toward the back of house
have stopped just inside door
forced to peer around them
' : On the bed, the - ' body is propped up against the headboard, her knees up, her head fallen onto a shoulder: her pajama top has been ripped open and pushed up
Knotted around her neck is a pink scarf tied in a huge bow under her chin
On her feet, secured between her toes, is a commercial flyer advertising the Festival of Love
It is brightly printed with red hearts
It has been hand-lettered: : - capturing the audience of a   in full blast, in
The audience, mostly young, some in 70's costume, sit and loll around on blankets
Most seem to have some variety of refreshment
liquid or rolled
The  records the unsteady progress of a lovely , weaving her way through the blankets and the bodies
She suddenly becomes aware of the camera being aimed at her
She stops, strikes a comically seductive pose and gives a big, gorgeous smile
: '  - answers the door
and Ruben
She just got to sleep
Do you have to tell her about it now
Tell her about what (mock admiration) Gaahhd
What a cop You busted me
(real) The new one, in the Marina
(to their reaction) She has a police radio scanner
It's always on
She turns it off, and then she has to turn it on again
She's obsessed
She can't not listen to it, but she can't listen to it, so she makes me listen to it
am not going to look at any more pictures
They're like a disease
They get into my head
can't get them out
don't look at pictures
look at the real thing don't feel infected
Maybe that's why you can't catch him know what she looks like -- the red-headed woman in my computer
just came from her
here's what you haven't seen
takes out a picture of the dead -
Her manner is that of cop with a witness
(cont'd) forgery of the Mary Sullivan murder scene, he's done it perfect
Except for the sign
(looking at photo) She probably let him in the door without a thought
Where are their mothers
Where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight
Look at the sign
'Hell'
In the Festival of Love
You make any sense in that
stares at the picture
(cont'd) For 'Hell', read 'Helen'
He's talking to you
It's anybody connected to author- ity
They write, they even knock on your door
They're fans It thrills them to flirt with getting caught
Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on  or the news
Why would he want to get in your computer
Because 'm his damned pin-up girl
His, all of them
They know me
They're in prisons with libraries, they collect clippings, 'm their worthy opponent
You keep my name out of this
Absolutely
My promise
Andy, who has ducked out, now reappears, dressed for a date
The moon is up, my night to howl
Will you be okay
Oh, God,  forget
Yes
Yes
You go
Poor thing, you ought to get out
(to
) Look out for her
She's tougher than you think
He goes

'  What's the rest of it
MaryJane
We call her
MaryJane
You think that logic and police procedure, order and science and method will hold back the horrors of a world gone mad and the sickness of the night
did once
But you know how he'll get caught
He'll have an accident, or some cop will get lucky
You can't catch him by being intelligent and working hard
Or the worst:  there are dozens of women slaughtered in the most horrible way, month after month
The news stories grow more grotesque and bizarre and in the city people lock their doors and windows, and hurry home before dark
And then, one day, there are no more
What happened
Did he just stop
Get tired and disgusted and decide not to kill any more
Did he kill himself
Did he die in an auto accident
Or a fight
Or get sick and die
It's like the murderer walked off the edge of the earth
And you never know
But you keep asking yourself -- when you read about a new murder -- is he back
stands
She has noted Ruben's reaction to Helen's story
There is an edge of sarcasm in her voice
That's amazing
whole new book, thought up in a minute
Very good
(beat) All  know how t do is get up, take a shower, and go to work
Hope, if he does another 'll nail the son of bitch, and they'll spell my name right in the newspaper
Where is Andy going
He's going home
He slept over because  was a little anxious
want a guard on you
'm worried about leaving you alone
(to
) We're through for the night, aren't we
You go on
Get some sleep
'll stay until we can get a man out here and maybe catch a cab home
That would be much appreciated
Thanks
(to Helen) Somewhere down the line we're doing to find a connection between him and you
want you to worry that idea like a loose tooth
Three voices chime self-conscious 'Good-nights

She stops momentarily on the sidewalk to look up at Helen's window
The drapes swing open The Camcorder zooms to a close-up of
She gets into her car and speeds off
'  - Ruben is checking the windows
You ought to get some decent locks on these
six-year-old could get in here
Much less a motivated man
At the phrase 'motivated man',  looks at him boldly in the eye
You and MaryJane aren't lovers
Not yet
laughs
So does
Her boldness, her laughter attracts him
His honesty attracts
He feels the heat
Are you always so bold
No
'm shy and 'm selective
His grin says he'd select her anytime
The problem for me is
you're in the witness category
(beat -- Jack Nicholson) Know what  mean
Well
Another time, then
(beat) 'll be all right
He's not going to attack me; what ' m rally afraid of is all in my own head, Ruben
They smile ruefully at one another, and without further conversation, leave the bedroom
: '   - is outside the door
just inside
They'll have a guard here tomorrow
know you have the idea, but it'll make me feel a lot better
She smiles, and  turns, walks away
She stays in the doorway watching his retreat
About ten feet away, he suddenly stops
Hey
He turns around, she is still in the doorway
He reaches for his wallet, withdraws a card, holds it up to her
The number for my cellular
Don't hesitate
Anytime Night or day
mean that
He hods card out to her
, holding onto the door frame, doesn't move
continues to extend his hand with the card in it
It is a charged moment
She is frozen in the doorway;  refuses to make a move towards her
summons all her nerve and lets go of the door frame, determined not to have any further mortification this night, she takes one shaky step out into the hallway to meet him
Then a second step and a third
Her hand touches the card, takes it
She turns her head to gauge the distance she must retreat
What she sees is that the door's Sureclose device has quietly and efficiently closed
The door is locked
Frantic, she turns back toward
: , now seems a vast distance away from her
He is just turning down the stairs and is gone
The hallway first narrows, squeezing her in, then expands
She is lost in the miles and miles of space between the two walls
Oh, God
Help me
reappears, races toward her
Tell me what to do
'm falling
'm going to fall
She starts to pass out, to sink to her knees, but catches her, puts her up against the wall, handling her like a suspect
He puts one hand on the back of her neck, spreads her legs, gets her in frisk position
Somehow, this is comforting to her, but she is still in full-blown panic
falling
He pressed his body up against hers, his weight anchoring her against the feeling of free-fall
'm right here
won't let you fall
He still has a hand on the back of her neck
Suddenly, the proximity effects him, makes him want to kiss her neck
She begins to hyperventilate
Don't let go
can't breathe
'll die
Shhh
It's okay
Just breathe
'll fix it
takes out his gun
Put your hands over your ears
shoots off the lock
Then he picks  up and carries her back into her apartment
'   - enters and puts  down on the couch, pulls a throw up over her
He sees her Xanax bottle on a table, hands it to her
She takes out three as he pours her some seltzer water, then watches her take the pills
After which he takes the bottle and pockets it
The lock
'll get a locksmith
Will you stay
Please
'm afraid to sleep
don't want
him in my head
pulls a big chair up beside the sofa
As her eyes close,  comforts her

He looks back at

Peter

The room is unattractive, over-furnished but not comfortably
is sitting propped up in a double bed
She is in her mid-thirties, but drained and pale, she looks older
chronic invalid
By her side is a , with ribbon bows in its fur
Near the bed is a  and video, on which a movie's final credits are running
enters
Younger than the woman, rather good-looking
Boyish and nondescript except for a patch of white skin near his hairline
He goes straight to  and puts the tape on 'eject
' Put in the Kevin Costner
Why don't we save it for later
It's almost time for Letterman
You know  don't like to watch talk shows by myself
Where're you
He inserts the video she wants and pushes 'play
'  Then he approaches the bed, leans over his wife and gently pushes a lock of hair back from the forehead
She ignores him, staring at the screen
The See, now you've annoyed her
You know she doesn't like you to touch me
(to dog) Does she, widdle wee fing
Wuhve you so much
(to Peter) Did you feed her
Yes,  fed her
If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you
Again
She doesn't lie
You sure you fed her
She lies all the time
Why would say  fed her if  didn't
That's what  don't know
Why would you lie
That's the problem
can't understand why anyone would lie
He leaves
As he goes we can hear the Woman still talking to her dog over the  soundtrack
(cont'd) You wouldn't lie to Mummy, would you
Just to get Dad in trouble
Such a naughty widdle dog
down the stairs into a small, ill-lit and dreary living room, into a messy kitchen, then through a door leading to the basement
He locks the basement door behind him
is brightly lighted, full of high tech, gadgets and computers
As he approaches the bottom stair, we see a small /video set attached to a wall
On its screen, freeze-framed and silent, is a video of a   at an outdoor rock concert, smiling seductively
puts on a    and then reaches over something to turn the video back on
The    to what he has leaned across
It is the   from the concert
She is strapped onto a table, her mouth taped shut
plastic bag covers her head, but not tightly
She is semiconscious
She is being asphyxiated by slow degrees
looks at her, gently pushes the bag up far enough to repeat the tender gesture with her damp hair that he made toward his wife
He whispers: Didn't  promise 'd come right back
: - dance across the skyline, of glorious misty green hills, hand in hand
The Camera moves down, across verdant meadows, until we arrive at the bottom of the nearest hill which slopes finally to a highway few festival up-all-night , looking down at a new , where three blue-and-whites are parked, plus a number of unmarked cars
As he moves past the ever-present  we takes one look at ' stubble, his yesterday's slept-in clothes, and she turns away
Before  can catch up with her,  approaches
Up all night with a sick friend
' face is tight with anger
You dumb son of a bitch
You don't even know how to treat a woman
Who
Hey, Nikko, explain to me why she gave you the boot
He moves to
who stands beside the dead The plastic bag is now tied tight around her neck
She has been posed beneath a sign that says " "
The usual technicians, photographers, Doc, the Coroner, etc
Is Niccoletti assigned here
(angry about it) Quinn decided we should form a task force -- they're all one case, now
He wants all the senior detectives on it
(to Doc) She wasn't killed here
Not likely
is kneeling, inspecting everything here; Ruben kneels beside her
to Ruben
Tell me what you see
He inspects the dead girl's fingernails
She didn't fight back, no hair or skin under her fingernails
'm not seeing any bruises or contusions
What about her arms
Needle marks, fresh, here
look at this
Nikko appears, looming over her
Probably so stoned she never knew what got her
Like Goetz's sick friend
Right Goetz
They ignore him
stands
She's blue as hell
No marks on her neck
Asphyxiated
not the same -- no ligature marks
Outdoors
Look at her legs
Spread out like she was sexually assaulted here
After she was dead
She was dragged up here from the road, you can see the tracks
She was already dead or unconscious
Let's get plaster casts on any -- all footprints
If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job
Where did he pick her up
Doped up kids all over town
Park was full of them last night
Very easy pickin'
Goetz's type
Ruben hits him, Nikko reflexively throws a punch that grazes Ruben
Everybody stops in astonishment
steps between them
Ready to get physical herself; they settle
What the hell are you doing
The Mouth and the Haircut are right down there, thank God they didn't see that
Down below, Susan and the Haircut are interviewing Festival- of-Lovers
Niccoletti, they're on the wrong side of the tape, you want to push them back
Now
Nikko trots off to Susan and the Haircut
gestures for , now on his feet and dabbing at a split lip, to follow her back to the cars
As they move more slowly down the hillside to their cars
Ruben, my God,  ought to put you on report
You're right
can't stand that bastard
Sorry
(getting back to work) This is something new
Not the same guy, that's for sure
Yeah, everything's different
But she seems unhappy
to techs standing by: Get the pictures, and casts of footprints
Look at him, grandstanding
Nikko is talking to Susan Schiff
That's all we need
She strides toward them
Detective Niccoletti
What's this about the Boston Strangler,
looks at Nikko
He should know better
She's also thinking: is this a good thing to have the media announce at this point -- or not
Hey, Susan -- 'm sorry, you're on the wrong side of the tape
We're still trying to find any footprints or tire marks and we don't want to chew up the ground, okay
'll talk to you later
(to Nikko) You, too
She's got Susan outside the tape
Inspector, will you confirm somebody is copying the Boston Strangler
This is the fourth, is that correct
We're going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement
She is getting into her car; Ruben jumps in on the other side
Susan races for her silver Audi
Ruben, put the light on
From outside the car as they drive away we see Ruben's arm clap the magnetic flasher on the top of their unmarked car
switches it on
has a faster car, but
is a better driver
Stomach dropping hills, trolley cars, the corkscrew turns of Lombard Street, all the familiar San Francisco chase scenes
Now listen up, Ruben
You never, never, never mess with somebody inside the case
Excuse me
Excuse me What do you
You damn well better start working on that impulse control
woman who is implicated in this case
Someone who's practically a piece of evidence It's against your rules that  try to help a witness who's scared shitless
Who's
The woman's unstable
You could wind up with a harassment charge
Anything You're like some horny little teenager
takes another two-wheel corner
In the rear view mirror,
watches  lose control of her car as she tries to make a tight turn,
smiles in contempt
Anybody who's ever watched  knows about that corner
Having lost ,
slows down to a normal speed
Everybody could see you -- unshaved, same clothes from yesterday, reeking of sex
' eye-brows lift
She peels into the  parking lot and jumps out
(going away) Park the car
Call the lab
Get Doc to lean on the coroner for a really fast prelim on the sperm
gets out of the car to cross to the driver's side
(
) When you get it, call me
look after her, a smile of delight on his face
She loves me
: '  - ,
know; the kid hit you first
He already told me
He's not treating her right
She left you, Nikko

She takes very good care of herself

Your business is to snap out of it
We were together six years, sir
Don't give me six years
You never divorced Patty, did you
So what'd you expect from
She knows 'm Catholic
She never mentioned divorce
Not once
Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying
She was just long-term leasing' you

There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now,  can't leave a woman in that position

Don't do that to her

The looks between them tell the story of his trying to give it up and not being able to, etc
So what have we got
It's not the same guy
It should be a self-solver
No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different
The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom
This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, , asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head
Sexually assaulted
The others weren't molested that way

Taking in Helen's condition -- due to a wild night with Ruben
Helen moves from the bathroom down the hall to her office, as
We've got another one
That's no surprise
But it's a different m
o
Then what do you need me for
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot
Where it says "no dumping
"  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose
It's all different but it seems so -- the same
Artificial and posed Something's wrong with it
You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style
That doesn't happen
These men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual
The method itself is part of the pleasure
They've turned into the office
Something is wrong
Who turned off the Internet computer
turned it off
It's like an open window he can climb right in
He comes in the window, we maybe grab him
Where's the on-switch
Have you got a warrant
Get the hell out o here
This is the only space  have left in the world Why can't you leave me out of it
Helen -- the killer directly contacted you
His interest in you is intense 'm worried about you
don't want to lose you
know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him
The only chance we have to trap him
(beat) So, you can turn Internet back on, or  do, and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate

The laugh turns to a hacking cough

Oh

Hello, Ruben

Please thank Inspector Goetz for taking care of me last night

Ruben, Dr
Hudson wants me to thank you for taking care of her last night
(hangs up) Lab report on the new one
At least two guys penetrated her
There were two kinds of sperm
The poor thing
What it must have been like
Helen has come alert
She was near a sign that said "No Dumping
"  Two kinds of sperm -- the lab said one was a secretor and the other was not
mumbles a surprised yes
Helen is at computer
There were needle marks
But no drugs in her blood
So far nothing they test for comes up positive
Helen has a Window type screen: she clicks icons
Is that it
(stunned) That's exactly
could have taken that same picture, this morning
"
" He's switched from DeSalvo to the Hillside Strangler
The Strangler was two men, that's why there are two kinds of sperm
His idea of a joke, very witty our boy
That's not consistent
You said they never changed their style, they're robots
Consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds
Tell them to test for the chemicals found in Windex

Why would he switch to a new m
o
Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him
Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive
This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex
He's playing a game with us
Who will he imitate next
Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame
Just to prove he's better than all of them
They got caught; he didn't
He'll get caught
If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up
Who's going to catch him
You
(beat) And if you do, there'll be another one
And one after that
(gently, surprised) You're afraid of him

It's on the lady's pillow
Ruben shoves Conrad into Backup Cop's hands

scoops it up, and rips it open
It's a book
He returns to Conrad, who is now surrounded by police
Ruben holds the book up like a question
Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that book, he wanted the lady to have it
They won't let him send it to her, so 'm getting out, he asks me to deliver it in person, he says, put it on her pillow
It has all about how he tried to kill her
He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad

She is trembling

Without warning, in some sort of manic phase of a freak-out, she breaks away from him, ricochets through bedroom, down the hallway,  follows, tries to put his arms around her
It's okay
you're safe with me
He pulls her down into a chair with him, his arms tight around her, holding her still
He smoothes her hair, rubs her neck, pets her like a frightened and resistant cat
When  was a little kid, and 'd be in a state, my father would hold me on his lap, until all the fight would go out of me
She breaks free and whacks him across his nose
You think you're my Daddy
There is something so perverse about this, so erotic, that kisses her
She goes limp, kisses him back, then she's suddenly sobbing

Hello
am (research title) Meryhew Saks
The song is called "Murder By Numbers
"  The performers are a group called The Police
Adam here
from Behavioral Science is working out exactly what this perpetrator is trying to telegraph in the note
This is an extremely complex case, and we have a lot of fancy theories floating around
We're not ruling out the possib- ility of three Copycat serial killers
We have Quantico working on graphology, the Washington lap is cloning  from the secretor
It's our feeling that the best lead we have is the two sperm samples in one of the victims
We have a team sweeping sperm banks
Now  want to say a few word to you local people
Your Commissioner asked for our assistance
The Bureau does not send us in on these cases to lord it over the local police
We couldn't catch up on what you people know if we had a year
We have nation-wide resources and hard state of the art forensic science; you have the local savvy
Together we can be unbeatable
Which one is Inspector Halloran
Over here

How come you're so up on Dr
Hudson
She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing
Giving lectures she's well-paid for
Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement
Okay
We've put a tap on Dr
Hudson's phone

So much for any trusting relationship, right

Sorry to interrupt

Now we got the , my team is expendable

Why Ruben, anyway
He and Nikko don't even get on together
Teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self-discipline
If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic
Just,  need results
And --  am short-handed
Who else am  gonna give him
(looking at Saks) Give him that pompous son of a bitch
She turns and leaves, brushing past Saks as she goes
Gigi meets her
Lab called
They got a result on the drug test you requested
It takes a moment to remember what it was
They said it was Windex
If there was any residual doubt about what's happening, it's gone now

Helen unfolds a xerox copy of the note, that has just given her

she looks up into ' face

Addressed to you
"Don't lose your head

She is holding herself together by main will power

They put  Merry Saks on it
He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem
What  can't believe is that in an earlier life  slept with him

The arrogance
It's my life It's also the major piece of evidence, and it makes you a key part of his plan
You can't run away from it anymore
(beat) Look at the order he's doing them
He did three as the Boston Strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work
Then he did one like the Hillside Strang- ler
And then one as Son of Sam
To lead us on -- to where and what end
And he's doing more than that -- he's imitating each killer's method as closely as he can -- in details
Injecting Windex
Using 44
Playing Abba
It's not chronological: Son of Sam was before Hillside
She begins to read
It's clear he thinks he knows me
He lives a fantasy
'Helen, don't lose your head
'  Is that a threat
Does he want to cut off my head
Dahmer cut off heads
Who else
Kemper
Did Gacy
Rivkind think Rivkind did
She puts the note down on the table, smoothes it out
She closes her eyes for a moment
We begin to see certain filtered images
As they come, we  them
He attacks what he feels he can't have
What he feels excluded from
- Lush, pastoral green
We see  sitting by himself
He wears a   , like one we saw hanging in his basement
:  of students on the green, playing Frisbee, studying together, picnicking
Women sunbathe, their straps pulled down on their shoulders, their tops rolled up to expose their midriffs
(
) 'First you make a stone of your heart
'
Oh yes
He doesn't suffer
That's past
Now it's our turn
One of the sunbathing girls sits up and looks round, then takes her top off entirely
(
) Kemper said in order to have the experience he wanted with them, he needed to evict them from their bodies
By making the body a completely passive object, he releases himself from passivity
:  ,
But the relief he feels is only temporary
'
Before your conscience bothers you much less
'  But the tension always comes back
(she now picks out the words:) 'You can join the ranks of the illustrious
'  He wants to be like them The best
To become the best
But, he has his own desires, his own compulsions apart from theirs
'  His own horrors
: : '   - An incremental flash of a   standing by his bed which he has wet
His pajamas are soaked
His powerful grabs him by the hair and drags him with her
(
) Some horrors that are all his own
The   is flung into an under-stairs closet where firewood and stacked papers are kept
The door is slammed hard
He gropes around in the darkness, finds a big box of matches, lights one
Then, angrily, he sets fire to a pile of newspapers
They start to burn
We see, but do not, hear, his screams for help
(
) He needs to prove they don't control him, that he's the one in control
But the feeling of power never lasts
He can control his victims, but he can't control anything else
his place in the world
He want s to be recognized
He puts messages in my computer; he sends me a letter
'  - She picks out the lines
"then you must try a twosome or a threesome
" Of course he wants to do a threesome
Only Bundy did three in one day
Is Bundy next
But Bundy should be last
the grand finale
What about Kemper and Ramirez
Gacy, Dahmer, Williams
Rivkind
Who else is on his list
In what order
- in his car
Ahead, he see   at a bus stop
We see  take a long bladed-knife and carefully conceal it under his right thigh
The   are wearing backpacks
'  ' stickers decorate the bags
pulls his nondescript sedan up to them and says something
They giggle, shake their heads
He laughs, holds up his hands to level of his shoulders in a ' Not guilty ' gesture, then makes a peace sign
The girls giggle again, but do not get in

all our greatest killers

When they're caught and people like me write about them, we give them a kind of immortality
They get thousands of letters
Ramirez kills eight women and gets a hundred marriage proposals a month
They're like film stars
They get fan letters

: ' Sergeant Halloran is it
've got a list of Daryll Lee's correspondents
There is a Peter Kurten among them
Daryll Lee claims he has information about Kurten, but he'll only talk to Dr
Hudson personally
Nobody else
The creep's been studying his amendments
My guess is he doesn't have zip
Just angling for a chance to ask if her bra size is still the same
We get this shit all the time, but it's her call
Thanks, Warden
(determined) She'll talk to him

They are waiting, Helen tense, smoking, atmosphere charged
Do those things really help
Like she really wished they might, so she could have one
Helen looks at her cigarette as though she'd never seen one before
grinds it out
Not a damn bit
And unconsciously lights another during following
, ,
Gestures encouragement; fist in victory gesture
: is on the phone, a Warden is attendance, but not on the phone line
On this rare contact with the outside world
Hey, Doc
How you doing
She turns on speakerphone
Hello, Daryll Lee
You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago
You read it yet
What book
(indignant) sent it by private courier, he didn't give it to you
That son of a gun
Helen looks at
, who indicates 'tell you later
' 'll look for it, Daryll Lee
Bet you never figured 'd follow in your footsteps
It's real well- written
You should read it -- you're in it
will
'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after 've read it
Right now  have a question
Peter Kurten
Kurten
Is he bothering you told that son 'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone
Ah ha
What did he want
Something personal
Is he bothering you
don't know
'd like to know where he is
Listen, you want my advice
Steer clear
He's writing me he's gonna finish 'my unfinished symphony
' He's gonna give me $550 for some of my cum, he says he's in a position to see that  will be immortal if he has some of my spunk
'm offended
Right away  smell freak Writin' about him and me and you bein' joined and he's gonna finish my symphony didn't care for his drift
sent some liquid soap in a sandwich baggie with a message from Jesus to mend his ways
You hear  found Jesus
And what's funny is, now  don't mind bein' inside
If  was out, even Born Again, 'd probably get restless again
It's maybe better stay here, what do you think
think whatever is best for you, Daryll
And maybe you're right, that's the place
You come and visit
Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten
Damn
gave that to Conrad, too
That guy
told Conrad deliver to Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in return for getting my book to you
At this mention of Conrad,
leaps to another phone
How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten
Conrad has the phone number
Conrad, where is he
(from
's pantomime) In jail
That Klutz
They send him back here, 'll kick his ass good
Helen, how is life, you okay
Come see me, talk to me
think about you, worry about you all the time
am so glad Jesus didn't let me kill you
You know -- you're blessed by Jesus
That's why you need to come talk to me, because Jesus kept you alive for a reason, and  was his sacred instrument
In the moment Satan was in my heart raising my hand to kill you, Jesus took my hand to spare you
am both death and life to you

She stands listening: we  the creaks and tiny snaps of a building cooling in the night air
Or is the movement of Peter somewhere in the room
She whirls to face a distance sound that echoes in the auditorium

Let us in there
Go

Men begin moving cautiously out of the trees and shadows toward the Auditorium
' : , , , ,   , You cheated
You said you'd come die with me

- ; , - , ' Listen to them
We'll be on all three channels
Kill me, Peter, do it, now
No
Not yet
Do it
If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it
Have enough guts to do it
Don't talk to me about courage know death, what it's like to kill
You're not a killer -- you watched Daryll Lee kill that cop and you didn't make a peep, because you were paralyzed with fear
You chocked
know something else about you
Peter is jerking about with amphetamine energy; he pops a pill into his mouth and swallows
You want one
No
There was something in you that was fascinated, that wanted to see what it was like for a man to die
Everybody feels it
Like every person who slows to see a bad accident, or runs to see a fire
That's true
see it in you
you're the same as me
Oh, no
,     ,  , , He leads her back to the stage
he pushes her into a chair facing him
He looks into her face and smiles
We'll keep talking
Until they get here
Then
(smiles) have no life anymore
ruined your life, make me pay for it
Why did you do that
Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far
worshipped you
You inspired me
thought you could understand me the way you understood the others
knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you
That's not who  admire --  admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers
don't have the talent for any of those things
All  have a talent for is death
And  am one of a kind
What do you think of your student now
have made you famous,  am your creation and your monument
:  ' If you let me,  can make you more famous than any of them
Oh, please
know what's coming, now
"Let me help you
" Do anything you want to me
give myself to you
Only put the knife down
Isn't this what you always wanted
know it's what we all want, to love and to loved could love you
You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness
Back in the driver's seat again, Doctor
That old dream -- study us to see what makes us sick
So you can find a cure -- they'd name it after you
Death is the only cure for people like me
He leans toward her with the knife
This might be the moment
His gun lies on the floor beside him

For God's sake, now ,  , (surprised, like a child) You hurt me

You think the rib is busted
That looks like just a bad bruise
'll tape it up if you want to
'll take some Tylenol and codeine, instead, how about a lot of number six
The medic turns to his medicine bag
Cops swarm around them
Helen sits down next to
begins to put on her shirt, wincing at the movement
Helen helps her
(it hurts) Oh, God
When
sees him she takes out her gun and hands it to him
It is what he expects, but she misunderstands -- she is offering it to him as her resignation from the cops
He takes it only as a part of officer related shooting routine ,    ,
'll take it, kid
You take two weeks paid leave
Don't waste a second thinking about that shitbag
Then come back
You're a cop,
He nods to Helen
(cont'd) Get the civilians outta here
She's in no shape to give her statement tonight
No, she can come in tomorrow
gonna want to know a lot of things
the cops have pulled '    , from the stage and lifted him onto a gurney
The body is wheeled past them, as
The only one who could tell you what you really need to know is dead
Yeah, it's a thought
Of no importance to him, he turns away

Outside, through the glass we  a media circus under the   put up for the assault

The cops and technicians are working away; at one side is a small door -- easy escape
They run toward it

Around the corner of the building we see the light from the : :
You could use a long hot bath, you know that
You better get somebody to drive you home
Why can't  drive home
will
You
Look at you
You need a ride home
And you don't even know it
(beat) Well, thanks
The two women continue down toward Helen's car, just outside the circle of media spot them and race toward them
Hey
Halloran
What's the story here
On the two women getting in the car
If she has to ask, she's never gonna know
