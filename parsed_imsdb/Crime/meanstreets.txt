Behind him is a Confessional Booth
The church is very old, quiet, and dark
The to reveal rows of Holy Candles lit in the foreground
suddenly begins to speak softly and confidentially to an unseen entity that is
() As you know, 've just come out of Confession
And as a penance they gave me ten 'Hail Marys' and ten 'Our Fathers'
'
() Now, between you and me
You know how  feel about such things
'Hail Marys'
'Our Fathers'
No imagination
over his head he has been addressing a life sized statue of the crucified body of Christ, eyes closed reclining in his sepluchure
() If 'm going to do penance at all, 'll do it the way  think it would be done
by me, that is
according to my own trespasses
You know what  mean
This conversation of Confession will occur from time to time in other parts of the story as  will periodically try very casually to justify his thoughts and actions to his "God
" The images accompanying these monologues are to be of free association almost documentary in nature
'  - The club is dark and noisy and smokey when  enters
He greets  who is sitting on a bar-stool
directs to a corner of the club where the rest of the group is now getting boisterously drunk
6
joins in, immediately taking on the mood of the group
The rest of the club is filled with many different types of customers: teenagers, adults pretending to be teenagers, sailors, male and female gays, and "the boys from the neighborhood

() Smile
What are you smiling at
This is a business night
() George

Too bad
: 's zany behavior as frenetically as it occurs
There is no particular logical sequence except that events are suited to the rythmic pattern of the music
1
and his friends dance and sing along with the music
2
picks up a billiard stick
He attempts to hit a filled shot glass towards  at the other end of the bar
He fails
3
tries to pull a tablecloth off of a stranger's table without moving the glasses or bottles
This also fails

punch is thrown at someone
lit cigarette in the puncher's fist creates a swift arc of light in the darkness

The Strippers finally appear on stage

He shouts to her, tosses things, and calls her names
She tries, half amusedly to ignore him but she can't
6
drinks from a bottle of Southern Comfort, and as a chaser swigs down Aqua Velva
: sitting at an empty table watching , the stripper, perform again
He stares glassy-eyed and then begins to speak softly, continuing his Confession
'know
she's really good-looking
really good-looking
've gotta say that again
She's really good- looking
but she's black
You can see that real plain
(as an afterthought) When you get down to it though
there's not much of a difference, is there
(He waits for an answer) Well
is there
(He smiles and begins chewing on an ice cube from his half ) Suddenly  appears and sits down at 's table

What do you think
'If a man have a hundred sheep, and one of them stray, will he not leave the ninety-nine in the mountains, and go in search of the one that has strayed
And if he happen to find it, amen  say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety- nine that did not go astray
Even so, it is not the will of your Father in Heaven that a single one of these little ones should perish

- tumbles from the car only to smack into a lamp- post

Well, go ahead, whaddaya want
Someone to hold it for you
More laughter
Even the  at the bar laughs

The  still follows

He and  are both nude
She is lying face down on the bed
He approached and ejaculates prematurely - However, he doesn't ejaculate sperm - instead blood
They are shocked
The blood is on the bed, her legs, back, and his hands
Charlie cries out in pain

Don't ask
29
He gives her a quick kiss on the tip of her nose
Alright
Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night
Did you
No
, you should have seen it
Unbelievable
The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin
That kid was scared
Not half as much as we were though
It doesn't make any sense
He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy
not unless it was personal
You missed the point
The kid's a climber
not very bright
but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation
He thinks he's in good standing
It's still sick
Not sick
just stupid
Speaking of stupid, your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother's house
to get some food

You're sure he doesn't know
He takes her in his arms

The image of  in the bathroom intercuts with stills from Catholic School text books - vulgar color illustrations of parables - emphasis on Christ expelling the devils from the posessed women
() But 'm not like the Pharisee who said "Oh God  thank thee that  am not like the rest of them
"
no like to think of myself as the Publican
He strikes his breast penitently as he delivers the next line
'Oh God be merciful to me the sinner

" - - is sitting in a quiet corner of the restaurant
This restaurant was considered an above average business with quality and prices to match when it was first opened three years ago
The quality has diminished but the prices remain the same
As a result the place is dying is scrutinizing the restaurant from his corner
He picks up a water goblet and critically examines the water spots on it
He calls a waitress to show her the dirt on the glass
She apologizes, cleans it with her apron, and places it back on the table
He takes a menu
chubby, middle-aged man, , approaches the table
He is half owner of the decaying restaurant
He is in his shirt sleeves which, along with the side of his face, are smeared with grease and dirt
He is tired and disgusted
(with a slight Jewish accent) Hey
you're here
They told me you're here
and you're here
How are you
Ok, how's everything going
sits down next to
32
Don't ask
do you have any idea what 've been doing all morning
eh
No
was in the basement fixing the pipes
Would you believe that
() What pipes
() What pipes
the ones from last year
those pipes
shakes his head in sympathy
Look Charlie, you're a good boy
Will you just tell your uncle that have nothing
There is nothing to give him
No envelopes with cash inside, no checks, nothing
That bad, huh
can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either
Not next week's either
listen
you tell that to Giovanni, not me
Listen,  should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that
don't need this aggravation
'm getting old
He'd rather have the loan payed, you know that
33
Your Uncle's a good man
won't stick him
Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place
And tell me why should  care
got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out
who disappears and leaves me with all the problems should go back to Florida
don't need this
don't understand, where's Groppi
should know
His wife don't even know
Probably off with one of his little girls
don't know tell you, if he don't give a damn, then  don't give a damn
Why should  kill myself
My uncle figured that this week was bad
but about next week
dunno
Maybe you should speak to him yourself
What can  say
- is walking down the street on the lower east side
noisy religious street festival is being held on the block
- enters a small Italian cafe and nods greetings to some of the people as he makes his way to the back of the room
This cafe is a strange hybred of coffee house, candy store, luncheonette, and meeting place for ' uncle and his associates
De  is sixty
He is well respected and powerful both in and out of the neighborhood
He became a head figure not by being introduced formally as was the custom, but rather by fighting and killing his way into the organization
is well dressed but not a stereotype of an old Mafioso, rather a kindly and intelligent old man
converses intermittently in Italian
34
man is putting new records into the jukebox which is in the corner of the room in the luncheonette area
(to repair man) Is my uncle back there
points in the direction of a doorway
Yeah, but  think he's busy now
Hey Charlie play 463 today - for sure
Thanks
walks through the luncheonette area, past the dining room where his uncle is in conference, to the bathroom at the very back of the cafe
is seated with his uncle
is forty five years old
He is ' closest associate, brought into the organization in the traditional manner, making his early reputation through hits (murders)
He is not very intelligent but has an undying loyalty to , and is very fond of
and  are seated with a very old man
They are deep in their private conversation
passes by unnoticed and walks into the bathroom
begins to wash his hands but changes his mind
He shuts off the faucet in order to eavesdrop on the conversation
- and  are calmly sipping their coffee as they listen to the old man's nervous talk
(in Italian with ) What 'm telling you is that he did it for Mario's honor
But you don't understand
knew the kid
He was drunk
He made of fool of himself
not me
35
(in Italian with ) Giovanni - an insult to Mario is an insult to you
There was no insult
(in Italian with ) The boy only did what was right
Your son only did what was stupid
We have enough down here without something like that
And what for
Nothing
no reason
Protect him
Why
didn't tell him to do anything for me
He's going to Miami
Good
keep him in Miami for six months
a year
a good long time
After everything's forgotten then  see what  can do for him
Right now
keep him away
- is seated at a table
The waitress, , approaches and gives him his cup of coffee
The following scene is reminiscent of a
Marie, are there Columbian coffee beans in this coffee
dunno
Just a second
Let me taste it
He pauses to sip the coffee, then shakes his head
Yes, 'd say there are some Columbian coffee beans in this coffee, but only about 39%
is disinterested
continues
36
You see
You probably don't notice this Marie, but Colombian coffee beans are rich coffee beans
Bursting with that good, deep coffee flavor
Picked when they are ripe to the point of perfection
The beans of course, are protected by the tall South American Guama trees
chews her gum for a moment and leaves the table
' monologue continues and gradually he falls back into his
As he talks, the of the cafe and the people in it
Then the bean pickers come down and pick each bean by hand
Bean by bean, all heavy with flavor
And they load them into boxes, one box at a time, box by box
From time to time  is casually glancing at  who is busy with her work
&  & The images now move out of the cafe and the aspects of the neighborhood -   and : stores, people, streets, buildings, in short; a concise vision of the neighborhood
All this is intercut with mentally stripping 's clothes off with his eyes
() Like, looking at my uncle back there
One way is the obvious; man outside the law
On the other hand, instead of a breakdown of order there is a creation of order and instead of the breakdown of law, there is the creation of law
In this society which needs new law because 'What's a crowbar compared to a share of stock
What's the robbing of a bank compared to the founding of one and what's the murder of a man to the gainful employment of that man
' 'Do not think that  have come to destroy the Law or the Prophets have not come to destroy but to fulfill
'
Amen
37
The image culminate in aerial shots of downtown New York City
( ) now sees  totally naked as she serves the customers
- and  are standing and talking
Uncle, how are you feeling
Fine
Did you have a good time last night
() About that shooting last night was there and
No you weren't
is struck silent for a moment
He listens
() You're right uncle
must have gotten it confused with something else
Yes, you did
: and  are now sitting at a table
About Oscar
think he put on this act
about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that
He can't make the payments don't know what to make of it
He says Groppi's run off with a girl
could help if you want
No
his business is bad
But 'll decide what to do and you
and you just keep out of anything that might
might
er draw attention to you
38
Yes
understand
'll be careful
-  - and  are sitting on the beach which is fairly deserted
There are rented cottages behind them has a book and some papers from which she is supposed to write a term paper for ' English class
'mon Charlie
one more day
'll call in sick for work
No
we can come back in a couple of weeks
Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right
Ok
picks up a copy of Henry James' Portrait of a Lady and tries to read it
He tosses it aside
Bore
paper on that one too
Yeah
but don't worry about that now
The Hemmingway one is first
It was nothing
'm almost finished
Take your time
don't care
know you don't
You've been very preoccupied lately
That's the word
preoccupied
turns towards  and tries to kiss her
She playfully turns away
But  quickly gets bored with that and doesn't pursue her
She is confused by his actions
39
Let's go back inside
: and  already farther up the beach, walking
They notice a very beautiful house with limousines parked in front of it
See that
know who lives there
The name George Earhardt mean anything to you
Sure
He lives there
No
Of course he lives there
Would  point it out to you if he didn't
The house is seen from a great distance
'
There is great activity
all with a very businesslike air
That
bastard
You're intolerable today
Watch your language
They arrive at the cottage
- and  are coming in, putting down the books and papers
like it here
alone
She caresses
He is still preoccupied
'm going to take that apartment uptown
Uhuh
probably a good idea
Why don't you do it this time
40
You know why
with my parents
Well you can't blame them in a way
(pulling away from him) can take care of myself
You know that
know
know
They embrace
' father is the patient in the bed
The visitors surrounding the bed are ' mother, , and ' mother
The        the sounds of mechanical voices coming from the
sets in the lobby
' mother leans over and whispers into ' father's ear
' Turridu
that's your boy Charles
Don't you know him
Isn't that Charles
There is no answer
is embarrassed
' asks again
' () Who is that
' Che Guevara
doesn't know how to react
'  looks up with a half smile in disbelief
The other Visitors give off a small ripple of nervous laughter, repeating it
in whispers
looks about nervously
Through the door of the hospital room can be seen several of the older patients gathered around a
in the hallway
They are watching the races, the announcer's voice is blaring almost incomprehensibly
41
- and  make love
: is getting dressed
is wrapped warmly in the sheets - still in bed
He must have heard the name from those
's in the hall that were blaring all the time
remember was in town at the time
Must've heard it from there guess
but that's funny, isn't it
Ummmmmmmmmmmmm
Of all people
Now say the truth
Do  look like Che Guevara
'mon
They laugh
He crosses to  and they kiss
'm sleepy
You've been running round too much
Bet you've been forgetting your medicine
The green capsules in the top drawer
gets her the pills and heads out of the cottage for a walk
-  - is walking along the roadway and looking at the different cottages
He is carrying a notebook to which he periodically refers
He stops in front of a luxurious cottage and checks the address on the signpost with the one in his notebook beside which is listed the name
He remains standing at a safe distance from the cottage staring at it
It looks deserted
42
- walks directly to the front door of the cottage and rings the bell confidently
The door is opened immediately which startles him
From inside the house we see ' back as he holds the door open
He is in a satin robe
We can see ' startled face through the partially opened door
What do you want kid
At that moment a nude girl, her back to the  appears in the
This startles  even more
What do you want

'm selling encyclopedias
er a magazines
newspapers
'm conducting a survey
We don't want no fuckin' books
slams the door in ' face
- is still standing in front of the cottage
Suddenly a little boy of about nine appears
There's nobody here mister
turns in surprise
Isn't this Jack Groppi's place
Yeah
But he ain't here now
Know where he is
Follow me
The  leads him towards a heavily overgrown treed area
43
How much farther
repeats this question periodically as he follows the Finally  finds himself alone in the middle of a dense forest with the  nowhere in sight
He calls out but there is no answer
He realizes he's been had
() Now, don't get excited
is trying to find his way out of the forest
() 'The stone which the builders' reject will become the cornerstone'
think
- loud brass band is playing "Oh Johnny, Oh Johnny, How You Can Love" inside the cafe
They are part of a religious festival and  has invited them in for drinks
In return they are playing for him

The song ends
Play it again
Everyone laughs and joins in
One more time

The band begins the song for the second time enters the cafe and goes directly to his uncle who embraces him
( over the music) Take a drink
() Ok
sits next to his uncle and looks around at the crowd in the cafe which is now singing along with the band
is smiling broadly
Loud applause follow the end of the song and the band tries clumsily to make its way through the crowd and out of the cafe
44
Hey, where you been

And when he was there
at night
: - An old woman is sitting in front of the television watching '
(continues in voice over) he walks into his mother's room where she's watching television
and he says to her
has entered the room with his back to the camera
that he's sorry
leaves the frame
The old woman looks up from the television
It's all right
walking towards the bathroom
45
(voice over continued) he goes in the next room

(voice over continued) he takes a gun and puts it in his mouth and
stands with the gun in his hand
He lifts it to his head
He puts the barrel into his mouth
He pulls the trigger

is visibly shocked
() How do you like that, eh

Groppi

He waves to  in a friendly manner waves back and  looks up, squinting to see who it is

In respect to he signals to  that he would like to see him outside

51
() You know damn well what's going to happen tonight

: is gluing on a fake beard
( ) don't know what You think of him but that's between You and him anyway
can't help feeling sorry for him though
Has a talent but doesn't use it
His brain
An 'Unprofitable servant who shall be cast forth into the darkness outside, where there will be
: Television image of old women mourning their dead in India
The images are slow motion
The news continues with more trivial news images
(Washington investigations, demonstrations, etc
) (continued voice over) the weeping and the gnashing of teeth'
or something like that
My talent's my brain too but  use my talent
'm not saying that 'm a genius
You'll probably be the first one to agree on that, but can tell the difference between the intelligent and the stupid
Take the army for example
: grabbing a white robe off his bed
We don't see his face
(continued voice over) That's there and 'm here and that's the way it's going to stay
52
- enters the bathroom, turns on the light and locks the door
Party noises can be heard in the background  is wearing an overcoat and is dressed as a World War  "dough boy"
Atop his head is a mask, the features of which can't be seen
He opens the coat to reveal twenty packets of red Jello
He turns on the hot water in the bathtub and slowly begins to empty each packet of Jello into the tub of steaming water
: &  -  - Most of the characters that were at the club the other night are present at the party
Many of them are dressed in semi- masquerade outfits
Some are wearing soldiers' uniforms
One wears a sheet made up to be a Roman Toga
The girls are in costumes also
All of the costumes are makeshift
is made up as Dracula, sporting a large cape, semi tuxedo-type suit, and a drop of blood on the corner of his mouth
His hair is slicked back to give him a "Bela Lugosi" look
He is showing a picture of a girl to one of the boys, proudly proclaiming that she is his latest conquest comes out of the bathroom and passes by
He takes the photo from
Group attention focuses on  now
He stares at the picture, holds it away from him, then closer to his face, then sideways and finally upside-down
Oh sure
know her Michael
In fact,  saw her a few days ago under a bridge in Jersey, making out with a nigger
grimaces in shock
He spits
You sure
a nigger
Uh
and kissed her
He wipes his lips with his cape
The guest of honor, the young soldier is very drunk
He is attempting to open his going away presents, one of which turns out to be a carefully folded American flag
He attempts to open it with one great flourish
He fails however, knocking over the glasses on the table
The group applauds
53
Suddenly, the doorbell rings and everyone looks up
The door opens and  appears, arms outstretched, dressed as the ressurected Christ - with white robes, fake beard and hair, and artificial wounds
His arms stretch out wider
The initial shock wears off and  greets him
() Hallelujah
enters in mock holiness
have come to create order
Scotch and water please
They all laugh
The rock music blares as  walks to and fro blessing all in the room
is delighted with the scene
sits at the kitchen table,  opposite him, and the others gather around
The party is getting noisier
gives  a glass of ice cubes plays the part of a priest, during the Mass when the chalice is filled with wine and water,  pours the scotch over his fingers first
lifts his hands to touch the bottle as a priest would
He signifies that there is enough in the glass
then repeats the same ritual with a bottle of soda-water
May God be with you
'And with your spirit
' (gesturing with his drink) Salute
Everyone drinks after repeating the toast
The crowd around them begins to break up as  and  begin to have fun with each other
pulls down his mask, revealing a skeleton death face which covers his own face except for his mouth
It completes the Dough-boy uniform quite well
(taking on the guise of an interviewer) 'Art thou the King of the Jews'
'Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others told thee of me
' 54
'Am  a Jew
Thy own people and the chief priests have delivered thee to me
What hast thou done
' and a few of the others gather around again as they continue
'My kingdom is not of this world
If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that might not be delivered to the Jews
But, as it is my kingdom is not from here
' 'Thou art then a king
' 'Thou sayest it;  am a king
This is why  was born and why  have come into this world, to bear witness to the truth
Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice
' leans over towards
'What is the truth
' The others around them give mock applause
smiles and nods his head to them
laughs
They drink
Someone hits  on the back of the head
startled, looks up
Prophesy to us, oh Christ
Who is it that struck thee
don't know, but God help him if he does it again
They all laugh
-   - is talking to
The conversation is serious
has not lost his sense of humor
He said he'd be here
55
Well, he isn't
Nice
real nice
He'll be here
Look, take this for now
He hands  a twenty dollar bill from under his robe
You kiddin
The way it is now this isn't even interest for two hours
(putting the bill back into his pocket) How much was the original loan again
$500
He borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans
now, counting the interest
it's almost $3,000
$3,000
Shit
Can we hold it at $3,000
Charlie, this is business
(avoiding the issue) 'But  say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute
' 'll tell you who you can pray for
Next payday, 'll be at Tony's Place
Johnny better show or  find him and break his legs
and  mean it
(in the same manner) 'But  say to you not to resist the evildoer; on the contrary, if someone takes thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well
to him who asks of thee, give; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away
56
() He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money
(more serious now) 'Amen  say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny
' You said it
loud scream is heard from the bathroom
: -  - Someone shoved a nude girl into the bathtub which is now filled with congealed red jello
The boys are laughing and shoving each other about roughly
comes out of the next room and walks along in a Christ like manner through the madness, his arms outstretched
One boy kneels and kisses the hem of his robe and  blesses him
There is a great deal of pushing and shoving going on inside the bathroom and near the doorway
promises to save the sinner as he pushes his way through
He helps the girl remove the jello from her body and helps her out of the bathtub
It is obvious that she is quite stoned
She caresses him and they find themselves kissing
The others storm into the bathroom and grab
Blasphemy
The anti-Christ
Crucify him
They drag  into the next room where, amidst all the shouting and laughing, the other members of the party are placing firecrackers on model airplanes, simulating their own "dog fight"
They are flying the planes out the open window
takes everything in stride trying to shout a few lines over their laughter
'Father
forgive them
for they know not
what they do
' The doorbell rings and  answers it
It is  and she looks very worried
57
Charlie
Charlie here
: & - and  dash from a tenement doorway
is still in beard and wig but his robes are open so they give the effect of being a bulky overcoat
() The building on the corner
That one
He's been on the roof a half hour now
Now don't get excited
Don't get excited
It is very late and the streets are deserted
At the corner of the building in question, a few of  ' friends cling to the wall for safety
When they see  and they call out
Charlie, stay there
He's crazy
He's got a 22
gets up against a wall
sends her down the block and she leaves reluctantly
Johnny it's me, Charlie
can now be seen silhouetted against the moonlight on the tenement roof
He has a gun in his hand
Don't come any closer
Cut it out stupid
It's me
fires a shot into the air
clings to the wall with the others
moment later he makes a quick run for the doorway of the building across the street
He enters the building that leads to the roof
& 58
- has reached the roof
Charlie
pssst
Over here
He laughs with glee
What are you
crazy
He slaps   on the back of the head
Hey
don't do that
'm only scaring them
Stupid bastard
you get your cousin half-sick over this
The boys below are still clinging to the walls of the building
is oblivious to ' statement
Watch this
He takes out a home made firecracker consisting of glass cigar tubing filled with gunpowder and a waxed fuse stick through the top layer of cork
He lights it
What the fuck
tosses it over the building and it blows up in mid-air
The boys below rush madly away
Lights go on in the tenements around them
The explosion was quite loud
Let's get out of here
() Did you see them run
& - and   are sneaking over a fence in an old cemetary which is part of their neighborhood
It surrounds their church and dates back to the beginning of the 19th century
No one is buried there any longer
59
It is very quiet and dark
They sit and rest
is still in his makeup
swear to God Charlie
my arm still hurts from the car accident
that's why  didn't go to work
swear it
() That's not going to help
'm going to work this week mean it
It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now
the interest is going up
$3,000
do you realize that, flash
'm sorry Charlie
didn't mean it
Big deal
in the meantime, it's done
'll still try to help you out
You know that
but you gotta show some effort
some respect
understand
Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess
How
() If you had a little talk with your uncle
if anybody can do it, he can
That'll help you out fine
That's the best way for you, not for me
swear to God, 'll rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this
You understand
don't care what happens, he doesn't find out
() 60
(') don't get involved with anything, you understand that
Nothing
'm clean as far as you know
right
Yeah, take it easy
Will you relax
That's what  get for getting involved
Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok
This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him
If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something
understand
'm not asking 'm telling you
understand
closes his eyes
looks at   and then looks at the cemetary in the moonlight
It seems totally apart from the city with the sirens and cars far in the distance
stands and unravels his robes, preparing to take them off
He projects the image of Christ delivering a sermon
Music and laughter in the distance catches his attention
The lights and the music are coming from the top floor of a tenement building where a Puerto Rican family is having a party
The sound echoes through the streets
Decorations are hanging and blowing away through the open windows
As  watches a fight break out over one of the girls
Screams are heard
People run up and down the fire escape
has pulled off the robe
He now removes the beard and wig and has become himself again
He leans over to find fast asleep on a tomb
'Could you not, then, watch one hour with me
' He wakes   up
'The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak
' 61
They leave

is motioned through by a cop, who shuts the door immediately behind him
There is an unnaturally loud clanging sound that echoes in the room
looks around, still a little dazed, and spots  standing over by the door
has made no move to greet him
He just stands there watching
walks over to him, sensing something a little ominous
My uncle didn't come
says nothing, just nods at him to step outside
goes out into the street
follows
: - There is practically no one on the street
The early morning light makes everything a clammy grey
waits at the bottom of the steps
(pauses for a moment) Giovanni says now he done enough
He got you outta jail
Now
(reaching in pocket) he wants you outta the way
hands  an envelope containing an airline ticket
He says use it
Don't sell it
He says he'll see you
Someday
Maybe
stares at the ticket in his hand
is obviously uncomfortable
() Things worked out rotten kid
Sorry
: 95
- ' car
He is driving  to the airport suitcase can be seen in the back seat
Where to
() Kennedy
(trying to be jolly) know,  know, stupid
mean where you goin'
It's an open ticket
can go anywhere up to $350
So
() So 'll send you a postcard from wherever
If  get there
Nervous
Yeah
You flew before
No
: ' face - slightly upset
snapping seat belt in car
: : airplane exploding    () : in car - more upset
96
() Hey, come on
Take it easy
only asked because maybe  could, you know, let you have a little something
Yeah, well thanks, but  got enough to hold me
My mother can send me some
don't know
How about Teresa
could talk
(trying not to be impatient) Listen,  appreciate it, but 'll handle it myself
'll write
And say what
'll say that 'm travelling
: - The  terminal at Kennedy
' car pulls up to the curb,  gets out, waves away help from an idle porter, and pulls his suitcases out of the back seat
leans across the seat toward him
Listen, try a place with some sun
Swimming pools
Palm trees
Girls in little French bathing suits
() Thanks for the ride
breaks away from the handshake and grabs affectionately behind the neck
Take care of that tiger
97
( ) Panther
Panther
Same thing
Hey
no more good times like before
Until you come back
Sure
And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right
() Yeah, 'm gonna worry about you, too
gives ' hand a last slap, then gets back behind the wheel
See you
nods and watches the car pull away
Then he picks up his bag from the sidewalk and walks into the terminal
: - The place is huge and there is a lot of bustle and excitement
is noticeable because he is the only member of the crowd who walks slowly, without any apparent mission or destination
He makes his way toward the large flight board that looms over the whole room
Loudspeakers announce planes to and from every part of the world
On the flight board, the origins and destinations of the days flight spin and change every moment
He passes the insurance machines and almost stops - more upset than before
businessman calmly pays for insurance
(Muzak is heard) continues on past a novelty shop where some plastic crosses and St
Christopher medals hang alongside the stuffed toy dogs and flight bags
He looks at the cross
don't know what to say to you
The ticket desk is under the flight board
eventually works his way over to the desk, drops his bag on the floor and stands staring at the board
He sees the names of dozens of cities flashing before him
As he watches, a pretty ticket clerk speaks to him from behind the desk
98
May  help you
stares at the flight board in dismay and indecision
He apparently does not hear her
Sir, may  help you
hears her this time
He reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out the ticket which he passes across to her
The clerk starts to open it to check the destination
(questioning, challenging) Where can  go
The question is unusual
The clerk looks up
stare back at her with a quality that is almost defiance
