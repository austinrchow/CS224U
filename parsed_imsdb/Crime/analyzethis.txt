Screenplay by and   and Story by and July 1998 Draft 1
1 a man in his 70s, narrates nostalgically  a of related news photos
(
) 1957 was a big year
The Russians put that Sputnik into outer space, the Dodgers played their last game at Ebbets Field, 'that guy' shot Frank Costello in the head, and missed, and the Gallo brothers whacked Albert Anastasia in that barber shop in the Park Sheraton Hotel
It was total chaos
With Anastasia gone, Vito Genovese figures he's king shit, but Carlo Gambino and 'Joe Bananas' both want to be boss of all bosses
So they call a meeting -- a big meeting

-                                   2 In  16mm documentary-style, we see a country road winding through rolling hills
At the top of the hill, a black '57 Cadillac appears and sweeps through the peaceful landscape
(
) It was the first time the whole commission was ever gonna meet face to face
Bosses and wiseguys were comin' in from all over the country, and all the New York families, too -- maybe sixty bosses, the whole wiseguy world -- all headin' toward this little town upstate to figure out what's what

-                                           3 sign reads, "Entering Apalachin - pop
342
" The black Cadillac speeds past the sign, then another black Caddy, then a black Lincoln, then another Caddy, a Lincoln, etc
(
) Your father and me, we were goin' up with Tommy
, Fat Tommy

') He was running the family at the time
Anyway,  don't know what anybody was thinking, but some asshole thought it would be a good idea to have this meeting at Joe Babara's farm in the country where nobody would notice

-                                   4 local state police deputy is gassing up his motorcycle when the parade of shiny black cars rolls by
He looks up and scratches his head at the unusual sight
(
) Turns out the local cops were watching Joe Babara like a hawk
So now you got about fifty Caddies and Lincolns pullin' into Apalachin and some deputy sheriff with cow shit on his shoes notices all the traffic and calls the Feds
5
'  -                                 5 The Caddies and Lincolns are all parked around a rambling country manor
Bosses and wiseguys are meeting and greeting each other on the big front porch
One  is trying to shoo a cow away from his car
You wanna be a ribeye
Get away from the fuckin' car
6
-                                          6 Federal agents start moving in quietly, heavily-armed, wearing big  arm bands
(
) The meeting never even got started
The Feds moved in -- 7
-                                               7 Agents with weapons drawn charge the house and start breaking down the front door

-                                    8 (
) -- and we moved out
Gangsters in shiny suits are squeezing through windows and leaping off balconies
- fleeing into the surrounding woods and fields
(
) Your papa and me hid in a field with hay or corn, some kinda foliage,  don't know

-                                            9 Two wiseguys in suits crouch in the tall grass
Suddenly they see a John Deere harvester bearing down on them
(
) Then along comes this farmer who almost runs us over in a tractor, so your father hauls out his piece, this
44 cannon he used to carry, and hijacks the goddamn tractor
Funniest fuckin' thing  ever saw
10
-                                          10 The farmer goes flying off the harvester and the two wiseguys drive off on it
The farmer looks up to see the John Deere disappear in a swirling cloud of dust that  the

as a hand reaches in and runs a lemon rind along the rim of the cup
The espresso is picked up and sipped by , the aging boss of a prominent New York crime family

Manetta is talking to , a dark, intense, intelligent man in his late forties, and a powerful boss in his own right
Anyway, Carlo Gambino came out of it capo de tutti capi, and that was the last time the whole commission tried to meet -- until now
(brooding) don't know
don't like it
What do we need a meeting for
Let everybody worry about their own business
They finish eating
The '57 meeting was about how we were going to divide up the whole country
This meeting is about how we're gonna survive
You got 'made' guys informing for the Feds; bosses going to jail; everybody's dealing drugs; people are getting whacked without permission
And on top of everything, now we got the Chinese Triads and these crazy Russians to deal with
Everything's changing
We need a leader
Someone with fresh ideas
Someone like you
It's gonna be a new century, Paul
We gotta change with the times
What are we gonna get, a fuckin' web site
You remember what else happened in 1957, Paul
Yeah,  remember
When your father died,  promised him 'd always look out for you
Come to the meeting

11   :    (2)                                               11 They get up to leave
Vitti drops some money on the table
Bodyguards follow them to the door
The waiters and the owner bow to them as they pass
They are almost out the door when Vitti hesitates
Wait a second
'm just gonna grab a toothpick
The instant he steps back inside, Manetta and his bodyguard are struck by an incredible  of , which   all the  in the  and
Vitti's bodyguard, , grabs him and throws him behind the counter, shielding him with his body
Outside, the shooting has stopped and curious bystanders are looking in the broken windows
Vitti's eyes well up with tears
: 12                                                            12 being pulled out of a box
, a woman in her early thirties, dabs at her eyes with the tissue
She's sitting on the couch in -- '  - The office is warm, comfortable, and nicely decorated
(weepy) kept telling him that  needed room to grow and find myself as a person
Not just as a woman but as an independent entity
her therapist, seems to be listening intently
told him  needed to get in touch with my uniqueness, but he couldn't handle that
He said was driving him away
Do you think  was driving him away, Dr
Sobol
Ben leans forward sympathetically

Things end, Caroline
That's just a part of life
It's how we deal with things ending that's important
just can't believe it's over between me and Steve
Maybe there's still hope
Well, he did take out a restraining order against you
have to be honest, that's usually not a good sign
But what should  do
Well, Caroline,  think the first thing you have to do
(voice rising) is stop whining about this pathetic loser
You're a tragedy queen
(mocking) 'Steve doesn't respect me
Steve doesn't love me anymore
' Who gives a shit
Get a fucking life
You are, without a doubt, the most boring human being  have ever met
Please, say something interesting before  lapse into a goddamn coma
Caroline looks curiously at Ben, unperturbed
Dr
Sobol
Lost in his fantasy, not really listening
He comes to attention and tries to cover

12   :    (2)                                               12 Yes
Yes
was just reflecting on your whole -- situation
It's very interesting what you were just saying
want you to think about it, and 'm going to think about it, so we'll both think about it and we'll continue next week when  get back from my vacation
Caroline bursts into tears again
Or not
: 13
-                                      13 Ben rushes upstairs and into his bedroom
His 14-year-old son  is in his room putting on a tuxedo
You're late
(changing hurriedly) know
couldn't get rid of my last patient
think she was a tick in a past life
Yeah, what's Caroline's problem
Your boyfriend's gone, he hates your guts, get over it
Michael
What did  tell you
You can't listen to my sessions
It's private stuff
can't help it
hear you through the vent in my room
Funny how that happens when you lie on the floor and put your ear up against it
() 8
13   :                                                      13 Okay, okay
How's that guy who dreams about shitting trout
(entering, putting on his tux shirt) Fine
He moved up to striped bass
Put on your cummerbund
Boy, have you grown
Did your mother move next door to a nuclear power plant
(struggling with the cummerbund) Why do we have to wear rented clothes to Grandpa's party
This blows
(helping him) We have to dress up because Grandpa can't have a good time unless everyone else is extremely uncomfortable
(looks at Michael and makes a quick decision) Forget the tux
Regular clothes
Ben exits, pulling off the tux shirt
(taking off his tux shirt) Are you ambivalent about Grandpa Isaac
(
) (from his room) Ambivalent
Where do you get that stuff
Mom
(annoyed) She's not supposed to do that, you know

13   :    (2)                                                 13 (') Your mother and , when we got divorced, we agreed we wouldn't put you in the middle, or use you as a go-between to talk about each other
So just do me a favor and tell your mother to shut her big mouth
(comes back into Michael's room) Did she say anything about me getting married again
think she could be feeling a little anger about it
Oh, yeah
She really cares
She says you're intimidated by women your own age, and that's why you go for these young babes
(fuming) Okay
Listen, for two seconds, pretend 'm not your father
'm just some guy, okay
You gonna vent
Yeah
(venting) hate her
really hate her
(a beat, then brightly) Okay
Dad again
Let's go

-                                          14 Paul Vitti gets out of his car and walks to the warehouse with his most trusted soldier, Jelly, a hulking bruiser, and his sidekick , a tightly-wound ferret with chips on both shoulders
So what did you find out
() 10
14    :                                                       14 (as they walk) The word is Primo Sindone must have ordered it, but, uh -- He hesitates
What
Jelly looks at Jimmy
What
(reluctantly) lot of people think you set him up
Why the fuck would  want to kill Dominic
He was like a father to me
So you could be the big boss
Everybody figures you're lookin' to wipe out the competition before the big meeting
Oh, is that what they figure
It's alright with me if you did -- didn't kill him
told you that
Don't you hear
: 14A
-                                 14A They enter a room where other Vitti family soldiers, , , and   are waiting
In the middle of the room, a young rat named   is tied to a chair under a strong overhead light
When he speaks, we get a hint of mental incompetence
() 11
14A   :                                                      14A Please, Mr
Vitti,  told 'em don't know anything but they don't believe me 'cause that one time said Little Joe hit Dukey and it turned out he didn't but  didn't know because -- (smacks him) Shut the fuck up
Nicky goes suddenly quiet
He watches in terror as Jimmy steps aside and Vitti moves close holding a short length of lead pipe
Nicky, you know me, right
Yeah
You're Mr
Vitti
And you know what 'm gonna do to you if you lie to me, right
Uh, you're gonna crack me on the head with that pipe
(slaps him) It's a rhetorical question, you fuckin' idiot
'm only gonna ask you this one time
Who killed Dominic Manetta
don't know
(roars) Don't fuckin' lie to me
(in tears) Honest to God,  don't know
You little rat bastard
() 12
14A   :    (2)                                              14A Vitti winds up to brain him with the pipe
They all wince in anticipation of the blow
But Vitti just freezes there with his arm upraised
Then he drops his arm and seems to sag
Forget about it
He doesn't know anything
He tosses the pipe aside
Get him outta here
Jimmy looks at Jelly in surprise
15
-                                            15 Ben is driving to the party with Michael
Sitting in stopped traffic, he checks his mirrors anxiously
(to himself, urgently) Look at this
Everybody's nuts
Ooh,  hate walking into that house late
think you're reacting like this because you're mad we have to go to this party
No
Don't
'm not going to be analyzed by someone who up until a few years ago believed in Santa
Sorry, but we only have room for one Dr
Sobol in this family
But there's two Dr
Sobols
There's you and Grandpa
(a beat) Can we talk about something else
Are you going to read Grandpa's new book
Mom says you won't because you're
() 13
15   :                                                         15 Does your mother talk about anything else or is it just me twenty-four hours a day
Wham
Ben - the  in front of them
That's your mother's fault
Your mother did that
Damn
: 16
90TH  -                                       16 The minivan has rear-ended a black Lincoln Town Car
The trunk has sprung open and Nicky Shivers can be seen in the trunk, bound and gagged, kicking and squirming
Muffled shouts can be heard through the duct tape over his mouth
Jelly and Jimmy jump out of the Lincoln and slam the top of the trunk just as Ben gets out of the minivan to inspect the damage
(heading Ben off) What's the matter with you
Are you some kind of moron
'm sorry
It's totally my fault
Ben looks at the damage
The Lincoln has gotten the worst of it
The rear bumper is hanging off, and Jelly is struggling to latch the trunk
Did you see anything
was talking to my son
took my eyes off the road -- Forget that bullshit
Did you see anything
Jelly steps in to defuse the situation, warning Jimmy off with a look
() 14
16   :                                                      16 That's all right, sir
It's our fault for being in front of you like that
(surprised) Well,  should have been watching
Let me give you my insurance information -- It's okay
Forget about it
Really
It looks like your whole rear end might be screwed up
Jimmy is reattaching the rear bumper and securing the trunk lid with duct tape
No, it was like that before
Maybe we should call the police
(suddenly menacing) Why
Fuck the police
Right
Fuck 'em
start  behind them
At least take my card
You might look at the damage in the morning and change your mind
Jelly takes the card and reads it
You're a doctor
Ph
Psychologist
shrink
You talk to a lotta nuts, huh
Ben hears  from inside the car trunk
() 15
16   :    (2)                                                 16 Pings and knocks
Cheap gas
Hey, how do those minivans handle
(
) Jelly
Let's go
Take it easy, Doc
Ben looks totally confused as Jelly hustles back to his car
: 17
-   -                         17 Ben's father, at the piano in the spacious, elegant, tastefully-decorated living room, surrounded by adoring guests, playing and singing an exuberant rendition of "You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby
" Isaac is a silver- haired patrician, overloaded with self-esteem
(ending the sing- along) All right, neurotics only
Well, you must have been a beautiful ba-a-by, 'cause baby look at you now, thank God for Prozac, baby look at you now
standing off to the side talking to Ben's mother
In the corner is a large advertising display featuring Isaac's smiling picture on the front cover of his new book, Tell Me What You Feel, Tell Me What You Want
What do you mean you're not coming
It's my wedding
We understand it's a special day for you, Benny, but your father and  can't just pick up and leave town every time you decide to get married
() 16
17   :                                                      17 Every time
This is a once-in-a- -- twice-in-a-lifetime thing
Isaac joins them
Dad, you're not coming to my wedding
We want to be there, but  have three book signings next weekend
can't piss off these big book stores
If  cancel, they'll stick me down on the bottom shelf
That's how they are
Yeah, that's the word on the street
The self-help book business is full of vindictive pricks
(looking around) Ben
The language
'm sorry, but 've been alone for eight years, now 've finally met someone  want to spend the rest of my life with and  would really like you to meet her before we get married
You're going to be her family
think it's better she knows that up front
You're really hostile tonight
'm joking
(jumping in) think 'll go talk to the mayor
The mayor's here
can only hope

17   :    (2)                                               17 Dorothy exits
What's wrong
Nothing
Everything's fine
How's your practice
It's great
Just great
've got some very interesting patients -- extremely interesting
Fascinating actually
Dad has a patient who dreams he shits trout
Thanks, Mike
Excuse us, Michael
Isaac pulls Ben into the foyer
Why are you wasting your time out there in the boondocks
New York City is the Mecca of Madness
'm just not sure  could spend my life dealing with people whose biggest crisis is how to fire the maid
It beats a guy with an ass full of flounder
Trout
And don't minimize my practice
Why are you getting so defensive
This is about your own feelings of inadequacy
() 18
17   :    (3)                                                  17 You always turn it back on me
Why do you do that
Why do you think  do that
Why do you think  think you do that
Go ahead, now you ask me why  think you think  think you do that
Enough
want you to think about what  said
And when you're ready to talk to me like a normal person, 'll be at the piano with Regis Philbin
(as he crosses away) Rege
'm not singing, Isaac
Now, ladies and gentlemen, at the piano, Regis Philbin
Applause and laughter from the guests
Ben grabs a glass of champagne from a passing waiter's tray
(to the waiter) Thomas Wolfe was right
You can't go home again -- because your parents still live there
: 18
-                                   18 Vitti's men converse quietly while a soldier sweeps the room for bugs
He gives the "all clear" and , the old consigliere, speaks
The Manetta family is asking a lot of questions
They think we hit Dominic
, the burly underboss of the Vitti family, jumps in
() 19
18   :                                                       18 Forget Dominic
They were after Paul
(to Vitti) It's a miracle you survived thank God
Yeah, thank God
All  know is if didn't have some veal stuck in my teeth, 'd be laying there with Dominic
This is all about the big meeting
Primo Sindone wants to run the whole show
Yeah, but Primo's a boss
He knows the rules
He couldn't go after Dominic and Paul unless the other families gave their permission
(starting to sweat) If they did, we're heading for one big fuckin' war
(having trouble breathing) Talk to Zello and Baldassare
Find out what you can
We got two weeks
If the other New York bosses are against us,  want to know it before  walk into that meeting
He feels a stabbing pain in his chest
You all right, Paul
You don't look good
'm a little choked up here gotta get some air
He walks outside
Jelly follows
Mangano looks quizzically after them
: 20
19
-                     19 Vitti is having trouble breathing
You feel all right
feel like shit
This whole thing is like a huge fuckin' headache
(concerned) You havin' one of those mindgrains
Sweating profusely now, Vitti feels another stabbing chest pain
Get the car
: 20
-                                      20 Vitti is putting on his shirt
He looks considerably better
Jelly is sitting down, tapping his own knee with the little rubber hammer
Nothing moves
, a young cardiology resident, enters
Good news, Mr
Evans
Your heart is just fine
How could it be fine
've had like eight heart attacks in the last three weeks
Well, based on everything, 'd say you probably had an anxiety attack
(a beat) What
An anxiety attack
panic attack
can give you some Xanax if it happens again soon -- () 21
20   :                                                       20 (menacing) Look at me
Do  look like a guy who panics
(nervous now) There's nothing --  mean -- it's a common thing -- Where did you go to medical school
had a heart attack, you quack bastard
(very scared now) Well, not according to these -- As Vitti moves toward the Doctor, Jelly instinctively grabs the Doctor from behind and holds him while Vitti wraps the blood pressure cuff around his neck
(low and deadly, pumping up the cuff with the squeeze-ball) Listen to me, jerk-off
had a mild heart attack and now it's over
You understand
The Doctor nods vigorously, his eyes bugging out as the pressure around his neck increases
If anyone asks you, you never saw me, and  was never here
Is that clear
(strangled) Yes
Good
(to Jelly) Take the chart
Jelly releases the Doctor, grabs all the papers and follows Vitti out the door
: 22

-                                   21 Vitti and Jelly come walking out the emergency room exit
Vitti stops
Jelly,  need you to do something for me as my friend
Anything
You have to find me a doctor
We just came from the doctor
Not that kind of doctor
need a head doctor
You're gonna change your face like Sonny Black
Don't get his nose though, he looks like a pig
Not a plastic surgeon, ya spoostud
Do  have to spell everything out
It saves time
need you to find me a psychiatrist
Wow
This is like the Psychic Network or something
just ran into a psychiatrist
Actually he ran into me
Is he any good
Yeah, he seemed like a smart guy
He had a business card and everything -- He had a card
That's a real fuckin' achievement

21   :                                                        21 What do you need a shrink for anyway
It's not for me
It's for a friend
This friend is having some problems, so 'm going to ask the shrink some questions and get some answers for my friend
Got it
And nobody can know
If anyone hears 'm talking to a shrink, it could be interpreted the wrong way
You know what  mean
Of course
Absolutely
(then) Can  ask you one thing
What
This friend
Is it me

Carl, 'm detecting a pattern here
You seem to settle too easily for things
You're right
do
No, well, there you go
You just did it again
suggested something and you immediately agreed
() 24
22   :                                                        22 You're right
did
Why do you think you do that
don't know
Well, sometimes people do it because they fear rejection or disapproval, but you can't let that worry you, Carl
And you can't agree with things just for the sake of agreeing
Stand your ground
Don't let people roll over you
The door opens and Jelly enters
Dr
Sobol
Excuse me
'm in a session here
Yeah,  know, 'm sorry
You're
You're one of the guys rear-ended the other night
Bingo
(to Carl) Get outta here
Jelly takes Carl by the elbow and lifts him off the couch
Upsa-daisy
You got a coat, nutbar
What are you doing
He's leaving

Jelly pulls a big roll of bills out of his pocket, removes the rubber band, and peels off a couple of fifties
(to Carl) 'll give you a hundred bucks to get out of here
Carl looks at the money, then he gives Ben a plaintive look
Don't take it, Carl
Carl looks back to Jelly
(peeling off another bill) hundred and fifty
He's not leaving
(trembling) Three hundred

Carl takes the money, gives Ben the thumbs up and exits
Jelly follows him to the door and waves for someone to come in
Listen, if you're upset about your car,  can understand that

Okay
You've seen my picture in the papers
Yes
And no

Jelly, wait outside
Jelly exits
Vitti walks around the room, taking everything in
He picks up the phone and listens
Hangs up
Sit down

Ben sits quickly on the coffee table
He crushes a box of tissues, then moves them out from under his ass
Vitti picks up a stack of  and looks through them
Tony Bennett, huh
Yeah
He's my favorite
Vitti picks up an autographed baseball bat from Ben's desk
(puts up his hands) Mr
Vitti,  tried to give the guy my insurance information, but he wouldn't take it
Seriously, tried several times because it was all my please don't kill me
was just gonna ask if you liked baseball

Big Yankee fan
Vitti puts the bat down
Mr
Vitti
Not that it's your fault, but your friend, he interrupted a patient's session and that's -- not good
think this is a matter for our insurance companies, don't you think
don't care about the car
Then what --
friend of mine is having a problem and he might have to see a shrink, so 'm going to ask you a couple questions
Do we sit
Whatever makes you comfortable
Ben starts for his chair, but Vitti sits in it first
Ben sits on the couch
Vitti adjusts the cuffs of his shirt, and runs a hand down the crease in his slacks
Okay, the first thing  gotta know about is privacy
You must hear a lot of weird shit in here
How do  know you won't go testifying -- not testifying -- but, you know, talking about it to somebody else
won't discuss a patient with anyone for any reason, unless know the patient may be a danger to himself
Like if 'm concerned a patient might kill himself
Not fuckin' likely -- -- or kill someone else

Vitti stares at him for a long, uncomfortable beat
So who starts
Why don't you tell me why you think you need therapy
don't need therapy
'm helping out my friend
You didn't hear me say that
Right
'm sorry
You guys are supposed to be so great when it comes to listening
You can't remember what  said two seconds ago
'm very sorry
have to tell you, Doc, 'm not thrilled with the level of service up to this point
Why don't you tell me about your friend
He's a powerful guy
Never had a problem dealing with things, you know
Now all of a sudden, he's falling apart
He cries for no reason
He's having trouble sleeping
And then he started having these attacks
You know, can't breathe, dizzy, chest pains -- like you think you're gonna die
Panic attacks

Did  say panic
Not panic
Dizzy -- breathing -- chest pain attacks
Right
So the question is, what can he do to make it stop
Ben decides to go for it
'm going to go out on a limb here
think your friend is you
You -- you -- you -- you have a gift, my friend
Go on
Medication could help, but if you really want to get to the bottom of this, you're going to want to get some kind of therapy
With you
(hedging) With me
Oh,  don't know

'm very heavily booked right now and 'm going on a short vacation tomorrow

Just getting that off my chest,  feel better already
It's like a load is off my shoulders
Thank you
Well,  really didn't do anything -- You did something
The load
Off
Where is it
Don't know
You're good, Doctor
'll be in touch
But listen to me
(leaning close, menacing) If  talk to you and it turns me into a fag, 'll kill you
You understand
Could we define 'fag,' because some feelings may come up -- Vitti silences him with a wave of his hand
go fag, you die
Got it
Yes
Vitti gives Ben a little pat on the cheek, then turns and exits
Ben is stunned

That means you're on call twenty- four hours a day just like the rest of us
No, he and  discussed this told him 'd see him when  got got back to New York

Thank you, but it's not about the dress

You're upset
Of course 'm upset

Can you explain these photographs, Doctor Sobol

Paul Vitti is my patient

Right
Was
That's what  meant
But not like a real patient

That certainly makes a statement
It's a little big for the yard, don't you think
What can  tell you, Mom
It looked much smaller in the store
Think it'll affect your water pressure

What are you doing here
Your father and  are just very concerned about what happened in Florida
How was your flight home
Anyone hang themselves in first class
We got in last night, we couldn't sleep a wink

All right
What's with you and Paul Vitti
Well, Dad, 'm not at liberty to discuss that
He's your patient
Are you joking
Have you thought about what this could do to your reputation
You, know,  always wanted to be great, but then  realized that might have to settle for just being good enough
Now 've got this guy who's hurting and 'm thinking that if  can help this guy, maybe  can be a little bit great
Jesus, Ben, you're the one who's going to be hurting
want you to stop seeing him
Didn't you read your own book
Instead of trying to run my life, why don't you just close your eyes, take a deep breath, tell me what you feel, tell me what you want

Let me cut to the chase
Sometime in the next week or so, the heads of every major crime family in the United States are going to meet together somewhere in the New York area

No
If he said anything about a bloodbath,  probably would've remembered it
Bloodbath is one of those words that, you know, stands out in a conversation
(gathering photos) You could really help us out by supplying information about that meeting
And if  don't
If you don't,  will personally make your life a living hell want you to think about that and call me at this number when you change your mind
You mean if  change my mind

(tough) Okay
Guess what, fellas
You don't scare me
Laura -- Sit down

Oh, yeah

Right now, we're the only ones who know about it, but if it gets out on the street -- what then
Who knows what you've been saying in there
It's none of anybody's business what  say in there
Paul,  beg to differ
If you're doing this to establish some kind of insanity defense later, that's one thing
But everybody's gonna think you're falling apart, and that ain't good
They'll take it as a sign of weakness, and that makes us all vulnerable
Sindone would take over everything
So what do you want me to do
It's time to end it
What do you mean, end it
Get rid of this shrink

Carlo Mangano comes to the table
Vitti gets up, hugs and fraternal kisses all around, then Mangano sits down with them
This is Ben
He's a friend of mine

So did you take care of that thing  asked you about
Is it all right to talk business in front of your friend
It's okay
Yeah,  took care of it

Yeah, but -- Exactly

What
The first thing or the second thing
That's Stevie Beef over there gotta go say hello to him for a second
(to Mangano) Come on
Ben watches Vitti and Mangano cross the room, then turns to Jelly and Jimmy
Stevie Beef
Interesting name
When he was younger they probably called him Stevie Veal

Paul's father was murdered
Right at that table

He's dead
There's a big difference
Why didn't you tell me
Because it's private
You think tell you every little thing
That is not a little thing
Okay, you want to know
Analyze this
was twelve years old, the whole family was having dinner together right over there, two guys walked in and shot him dead right in front of us
Okay
And you didn't think this was important enough to tell me
What am  supposed to do
Spend the rest of my life crying about the past
Forget about it

No,  don't want to talk about it

He's what 'm thinking about when  wake up, and he's what 'm thinking about when  close my eyes to sleep
If he told me to jump off a tall building, not only would  do it,  would hope to survive so  could do it again and again until he told me to stop
This is all  know
This is all  got
So please don't think won't kill you, because 'd hate for your last thought to be a wrong one
You're going to that meeting

-                                      100B Parked on 50th Street, Ricci and another agent watch the limo emerge from the Waldorf garage
Ricci signals someone on the radio
100C                                                      100C flies   over Park Avenue and starts tracking the limo
101
-  -                                       101 The black stretch limo approaches the tunnel entrance
An  helicopter zooms   high above

-                                  104 Fifteen identical limos emerge from the tunnel on the Queens side and start criss-crossing as they leave the toll booths, then head off in different directions

-                                       105 Steadman and Provo try to pick Ben's limo out of the pack of identical limos heading up the Long Island Expressway
(desperately) Which one is it
The black one
: 117
105A
-                                            105A Ben is in the back with Jelly and Jimmy
One of their crew,  , is driving
Ben is putting on a suit of Jimmy's
He looks very anxious
(his shoulder bandaged) Just remember
That's a fuckin' $1200 Valentino suit
You spill anything on it, 'll mess you up good
Shut up
You're making him nervous
If he gets nervous and fucks up, they'll kill him for sure
(to Ben) Let's go over it again
This is insane
Mr
Vitti's been detained, apologies all around, blah, blah, blah
Then you say you're the new consigliere, and you're prepared to speak for Mr
Vitti
Then what
Then you just keep your mouth shut, and hope nobody asks you nothin'
Boy, this is some fuckin' plan
Shut up
(to Ben) If you have to talk, just be vague
Can you do that
'm a psychologist
Believe me, can be vague
: 118
106
'  -                                 106 Vitti is lying on the bed staring at the ceiling
Marie is stroking his forehead
Then he looks over and sees Anthony sitting in a chair at the foot of the bed, watching him with concern
Shouldn't you be outside playing or something
No, it's all right
How long you gonna sit there
(shrugs) How long you gonna lay there
Vitti smiles
'm done
: 107
() -                         107 The limo pulls into the parking lot of the Tops Limousine Service
Fifty other limos are already parked there
Jelly and Jimmy get out, followed by Ben, now dressed in shiny suit and pinky ring
: 108
-                        108 Ben, Jelly, and Jimmy enter a garage the size of a small airplane hangar
The floor has been cleared and long tables set up to form a square in the middle of the room
Wiseguys with shotguns patrol the catwalks above the floor and soldiers are posted at all the doors
(sotto voce) can't do this
'm telling you, cannot do this
Don't fucking whine
Whining's a dead giveaway
Come on
You're the consigliere, for Chrissake
() 119
108   :                                                      108 Around the tables sit forty or fifty of the biggest gangsters in the world
few captains stand around the perimeter, ready to serve their bosses
These are the bosses
That one looks like my Uncle Max
Jelly steers Ben to an empty seat next to Carlo Mangano
(surprised) What's goin' on
Where's Vitti
On his way
Don't worry
Mangano eyes Ben with contempt
What's he doin' here
He's -- it's okay
Forget about it
Forget about it
What the hell is that
Seated directly across the room from Ben is Primo Sindone
He stares hard at Ben, trying to place him, then leans over to Moony, his consigliere
Who's the guy with Jelly
don't know
Ben looks away nervously
(to Jelly, borderline hysterical) can't do this
He starts to get up but Jelly pulls him back down
Moony stands up and gets everyone's attention
() 120
108   :    (2)                                                108 All right, gentlemen
think we better start
We have a big agenda, so for now let's stick to the big issues
And it would help if you identify yourselves when you speak, since we don't all know each other, and we didn't think anybody would be into wearing any fucking name tags
Laughter around the table
Sindone stands up and looks straight at Ben
'm Primo Sindone
They call me Sonny Long
It's good to see so many of the old faces here, and to welcome the new ones from all over the country
see Frank Zello, and Joe Baldassare, but 'm a little disappointed to see that the head of our other New York family isn't here today
All see is his man Jelly and some sawed-off little prick nobody knows
Jelly looks at Ben, waiting for him to speak, but Ben just sits, frozen, looking down at his hands
(stands up, rattled) Yeah, well, the thing is Mr
Vitti has been detained and he sends his apologies for -- being detained -- and he apologizes for his -- detainment
Detained
What kind of bullshit is that
What's more important than this
As the host of this meeting,  take his not being here as a sign of disrespect to me and to all these other men, too, who came a long way to be here
Mr
Vitti meant no disrespect
The thing is, he's not feeling well
He's sick and he -- didn't feel well -- () 121
108   :    (3)                                                108 Ben rises and slaps Jelly hard across the face
(quietly) Jelly
We don't ever discuss Mr
Vitti's health outside the family
You know better
Jelly is stunned
The bosses murmur
All right, who is this guy and what the fuck is he doing here
In answer to your first question, my name is Ben Sobol -- (off Sindone's look) -- leone
Sobboleone
They call me -- 'The doctor
' As for your second question
'm here representing Paul Vitti
As his conser -- conghili -- (prompting) Consigliere -- (slaps him again) Don't you ever correct me again
As his consigliere, 'm intimately involved in all aspects of the family business and 'm prepared to speak for Mr
Vitti on all matters
Okay, Doctor, then let's get down to business
Everybody knows there's been this thing between me and Paul Vitti for a long time
Which thing are you talking about
The first thing or the second thing
What second thing
only know one thing
() 122
108   :    (4)                                               108 Well,  don't see how we can discuss the first thing without bringing up the second thing
Didn't you talk to the guy
He tugs meaningfully on his earlobe
What guy
The guy with the thing
What thing
What the fuck are you talking about
How should  know
You brought it up
(gestures helplessly to the others) This is the whole problem
You can't have an intelligent conversation with the man
How about if  just break your fuckin' neck
What do you think of that
It's not important what  think
What do you think
What do  think
think it's a good idea
Why would  say it if didn't think it was good
don't know
Why would you
(frustrated) wouldn't
That's what 'm saying
Have you always had a problem dealing with your anger
() 123
108   :    (5)                                               108 What are you talking about
What do you think 'm talking about
(explodes) don't know what the fuck you're talking about
See, you're angry again
Do you feel you have to get angry to be heard
Sindone turns to a couple of other bosses, and
What's he talking about
don't know
But you do have a tendency to get angry a lot
agree, Primo
'm trying to talk about Vitti
Why are we talking about me
Interesting
Do you feel you're not worthy enough to be talked about
What does that mean
What do you think it means
Fuck you
Primo, calm down
() 124
108   :    (6)                                                108 Calm down
How can  calm down when this prick won't stop with the questions
Could you pass the fruit, please
That's it
You're a dead man
Sindone whips out a pistol and points it at Ben, but just as he's about to shoot -- (
) Primo
All eyes turn
109                                                           109 He's standing there, staring at Sindone, cool, clear, and unafraid
He looks like a king
The room goes silent
Vitti looks around the table, nods, and crosses to Ben
Jelly gets up to greet him
(quietly, to Jelly) Wait outside with the car running
Jelly nods and exits
What are you doing here
Saving your ass
Sit down
'll take it from here
Ben sits, greatly relieved
(to the group) 'm Paul Vitti
'm sorry  was late
Those of you who know me will know  meant no disrespect
If it's all right with you, there's something 'd like to say, then 'll leave you to your business
Ben looks at Vitti and sees a kind of serenity and clarity he's never seen before
() 125
109   :                                                        109 About two and a half weeks ago, somebody killed my friend, Dominic Manetta
He looks straight at Sindone
Don't look at me
Everybody knows you whacked him so you could take over everything
What  really came here to say is that 've come to a very important decision in my life
want out
great murmur of surprise sweeps around the room
Ben looks at him proudly
'm going away for a while, but will respect the oath  took the day  was made, and whatever know about anyone else's business, take with me to the grave
You have my word
negative buzz among the bosses
As for my own organization,  know Carlo Mangano would like to be the new boss
Mangano smiles gratefully
Thank you, Paul
That's why he betrayed Dominic and me to our enemies and sent his own man to kill me in Miami
Mangano is stunned
But  leave it to my people to deal with that and choose their own boss
And even though it's my right,  won't take revenge, mostly because 'm in a good place mentally and feeling good about me
() 126
109   :    (2)                                                  109 (perplexed) don't know, Paul
can see where some people might have a problem with this
realize that, so as an extra token of good faith between us, 've taken the liberty of writing down everything  know and putting it in a safe deposit box in case anything happens to me or my family
There's a long tense silence while the other bosses consider all this
Then, finally -- don't know what anybody else thinks, but  say good luck and God bless, Paul
Good luck, Paul
Salut
They all raise their glasses and toast Vitti
Ben raises his glass to Vitti and drinks
(to Vitti) Well done
Vitti smiles at him and drinks
: 110
-                                     110 Ben and Vitti come out of the building and cross to the car
Jelly is waiting, Iron Mike has the  , and Jimmy is in the front seat with him
Let's move
Sindone and Mangano come out with guns drawn, flanked by two wise guys
Vitti

don't want to do this, Primo
You don't want to do this
That's fuckin' rich
What did you think, you could just quit and walk away
You think this is a fuckin' civil service job
What are you, crazy
Not anymore
(to Mangano) Hey, Carlo, tell me
You gonna stab me in the back like the piece of shit  always knew you were
Mangano stares at him, cold and hard
'm not gonna stab you in the back, Paul
want to see your face when  do it
don't think so
(calls out) Mo-Mo
Mo-Mo stands up from behind a car pointing a shotgun at Mangano and Sindone
Bigs
Johnny Bigs steps out from behind a shed holding an assault rifle
Eddie
The back of a van opens to reveal Eddie "Cokes" and Tuna manning a military air-cooled machine gun on a tripod
It's over, Primo
Now get the fuck outta here
Sindone glares at him, then lowers his gun, turns, and starts to walk back into the building joined by Mangano and the soldiers
() 128
110    :    (2)                                                   110 Vitti and Ben relax
Good thinking
was going to bring a machine gun but  don't have one
Of course, we haven't opened the wedding gifts yet
Suddenly, Sindone whirls and  at Vitti
Ben staggers in front of Vitti and takes the bullet in the shoulder
: 111
-                                       111 The assembled bosses hear the sound of  outside
Zello looks at Baldassare
Oh, shit
The bosses all jump up and run for the exits

115

45 aimed at his head
(screaming) Don't move
Don't you fucking move
Hey
Take a pill, Robocop
Vitti is tending to Ben who is on the ground leaning against the side of the limo
(deeply moved) can't believe it
You took a bullet for me
What doctor ever did that much for a patient
'll never forget that
Paul --  tripped
Yeah
You tripped over your unconscious

She never listened
And how does that make you feel
It makes me feel angry
'll bet you feel hurt, too, don't you
(suddenly vulnerable) Yes,  do
Paul, what would you say about what Donny's feeling
Donny, when you're thirsty, you don't go to the wall -- you go to the well
You know what 'm saying
Your mother may never be able to listen to you, but you have friends here who will
Okay
Ben is proud of Vitti's new sensitivity
And be patient, Donny
Most people's problems take months, sometimes years to resolve
'm doing twenty-five to life
That should be plenty of time

heard
(off Ben's look) had nothing to do with it
There were guys lined up from Canarsie to Atlantic City who wanted to whack that bastard
Okay, just checking
You know, Doc,  don't think ever thanked you properly for curing me
We don't say 'cured
