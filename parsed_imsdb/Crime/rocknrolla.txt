Glad you could join us here Lenny
It's nice to see you Uri
Good
(there is a pause) can see we are very much alike you and  Lenny
We like to get things done
(beat) What's it going to cost me
First, let me make clear how much we can help you benefit from this deal
With out me, it will take you five to ten years to get the permission to erect your arena
(beat) Second, with Government policy as it so stands we both know it's unlikely that you'd ever get that consent
(beat) Thirdly, in legal fees, transactions and building consent, you'd be paying 6 to 12 million without any real guarantee of that result
We   Uri unfazed, he just wants the figure

Lenny passes a that's sat on an
Oh, that's a nice picture Uri, hasn't it got, errrh depth

We  One Two and Mumbles get out of their car and run over to the Range Rover on its side, they are carrying an axe and bolt cutters
Inside,  2 slowly opens his dazed eyes, to  an axe chopping through the window
and the window gives in
One Two leans in and grabs the case, but it's chained to  2's wrist
One Two pulls the arm out of the window and Mumbles uses massive bolt cutters to cut the case free
There's another case, grab it
One Two leans in and grabs the second case from Chechnyan 1
As he is about to chop this one loose, he is pulled into the car by  2
The bastard's still kicking
Mace him, mace him
Mumbles quickly moves around to the other window and sprays mace everywhere, including into One Two's eyes
(') Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, not me you idiot, the Guerrilla
2 in the mean time has regained some of his strength and is still pulling One Two into the car with him

That's my fuckin arm
One Two manages to head butt  2 and goes back to reclaiming the case from  1
He pulls it out and Mumbles cuts the chain
One Two can't see a thing
Let's go, we've got it
Give me a hand, you've blinded me
Major confusion is setting in
They run back to their car, which is still running, Mumbles shoves One Two into the back and jumps in the drivers seat
(') Go, go, go, go
With his window open, Mumbles wheel spins out of the situation and turns to check on One Two
From out of nowhere a very large  arm shoots through the window and puts Mumbles in a neck lock
The  2 is holding on and not letting go
The car tears across the road and enters a shop window that has a mezzanine
The car comes to a halt on a precarious ledge, it's dangling with the  2 still not letting go

Who's got the cases
've got 'em
As they get out of the car,    1 has now made his way down the street
He is punch drunk with mace in his eyes, but extracts a machine gun from under his jacket
The boys freeze they are fucked, nowhere to go, but  1 is blinking profusely he can't be sure where they are
He lets off a magazine into the manikins next to our boys who all hit the deck
The magazine runs dry,  1 dips into his belt to extract a fresh one
Mumbles see's his opportunity, he grabs a golf club that is standing next to him, runs at  1 and takes a massive swipe at his head
1 goes down, but he has already put in a new magazine
Mumbles is still carrying the cases, One Two is attached to his arm
Shoot him Mumbles or we won't get out of this
can't fuckin shoot him, you do it
baseball smashes into Mumbles face, he goes down, and he's out
2 has appeared carrying a metal baseball bat
One Two picks up the machine gun
Stop or 'll shoot
2 will not stop, he just keeps on coming
(') mean it, get down,
get down
2 keeps coming, One Two doesn't want to do it but he has to
He lets off twenty three bullets into the 2's chest, the  is knocked back and disappears over the mezzanine
One Two is in shock, he has never killed a man
He stands there numb

Down
He slams on the brakes
2 goes flying over the roof, but stops himself hitting the road by perforating the hood with his massive knife
He proceeds to perforate the wind screen with another knife that he extracts and (because of laminate) starts to saw through the wind screen

Mumbles hits the  from behind with a car Jack and  2 goes down again
One Two's eyes have just about come back
Run
Run for your lives
The crew split in
Bob takes the cases and plucks some poor bystander out of their car and takes off
Mumbles disappears another way
2 is up and follows One Two - terminator style, a foot chase begins
One Two, split from the group and being pursued, jumps over a wall

97 One Two has ended up on a railway track
He turns back, why should  2 chase him, he hasn't got the money
But no,  2 is over the fence, bullet proof vest flapping in the wind, and coming after him
One Two finds his strength this is his world, the world of the runner - he's off down the tracks

The run goes on and on
2 has ripped off his jacket, we can see his massive scar covered torso dripping in blood and sweat, he seems unstoppable
One Two gets confident and starts to run backwards egging  2 on,  2 is a good runner, but not good enough
Deep hate fills his eyes as One Two makes a fool out of him,  2 will remember this man
One Two is taking complete liberties, he almost stops and waits until  2 has caught up to him and then he tears off, the  keeps coming
One Two see's in the distance a tiny moped approaching from a distance, its  1 who completely out sizes the machine
However, he's moving and it's moving faster than One Two
One Two ducks off the tracks and over a wall, the moped gets nearer
At least when he gets over the wall, the moped won't follow right
One Two's over
He can hear the moped on the other side, One Two looks over his shoulder he can see the moped being lifted over the wall
"Oh shit
" This is where One Two's "zone" comes into play
He drifts in to a place that he can not be disturbed and he runs and runs and runs
Up, down, through and in

He is on a motorbike that he has stolen

Sorry, Johnny's not home right now, but the pipe is and the pipe says that Johnny heard you were getting in trouble boys

You're madder than  am
Come back Johnny, come back home
But home is where your head is and don't feel at home in my head

Johnny smiles and pulls out a gun from under his arse
He points it at Roman, waits until he knows they feel it and pulls the trigger
It's a lighter
He relights his splif, hot hash dropping on his chest, he ignores it

(impersonating Lenny) 've seen jelly fish with closer than that slag

The base thumps out
Archy tries the handle, it turns, he pushes the door open slowly
The music becomes clear as we reveal a horrible scene
Archy is shocked, but a little amused

He is "having much fun
" His massive frame is still black and blue from the beating One Two previously inflicted
The other Chechnyan (similarly dressed), is digging into his bag of tools, extracting all sorts of horrible looking things
Archy looks on amazed by the show, he has a quick look at Danny who is also bemused
He hits the "off" button, the Chechnyans spin, looking distressed
Silence ensues
Is this a bad time One Two
(unable to say anything) Emmm, emmmmmmmmmmmm
Shall we come back later

You're a dirty bastard Sidney, a very dirty bastard
Archy grabs the belt that's used to tie up drowning victims, he throws it round Lenny's chair and stuffs a bit of cloth into Lenny's wide open mouth
(') (to One Two, Handsome Bob and Mumbles) You three, cut yourself free and get out of here,
Archy throws a knife across to Mumbles who just catches it and starts to cut his way out of the ropes
Archy gets back on with the job at hand
He reads through the names Lenny has grassed on over the years
(') Michael Finny, ten years
Frazier Nash, fifteen years
Cousin Ronnie, six years,
you dirty bastard
(beat) Michael Dexter, eight years
Archy grabs the winch that lowers victims to their crayfish death and bangs it on to the back of the wheel chair

(') The Jew twins, fourteen years and of course , Archy, four years
One Two, Mumbles, and Handsome Bob are free
See ya Arch,
The three of them are out like rats up ropes, they start to run down the stairs

149
-                         149 We see six gallons of petrol in the trunk of the car in our imaginary scene
And pour six gallons of petrol on top,  can let your imagination fill in the rest

150 Back to present
But now Danny's rattled, he won't be able to wait because you now know what's coming, so he's gonna fire
Danny, who is now in a state because Johnny has predicted everything he's going to do, suddenly turns with his gun
Mickey catches it, the force of the stop pulls the trigger, and the other  head is drilled through
Roman joins the wrestling match and gets the gun and wrist to aim at Danny's head
The trigger gets squeezed and Danny's head also gets a drilling
Silence
Johnny, who is smothered in blood, speaks coolly
Mickey, pass me the gun
Mickey is out to lunch, but Johnny sounds commanding
(') quickly, pass me that gun in Dannys hand
Don't worry he can't defend himself he doesn't have a head, quickly now
Does this answer the question that you two so frequently asked as to why  sought refuge in the depths and perverse beauty of the crack pipe
The elevator door opens

He looks on in horror and points the gun at Johnny
Just as he's about to fire,
there is a great smash of bone on timber
Bandy falls to reveal One Two standing there with a large piece of timber
think we should get out of here now, don't you John
At which point in the background   Lenny being lowered to his demise
He looks at the group in horror as he is quickly lowered to his death by drowning and cray fish

Please do not be insulted, you have come to mean a lot to me and  value you much more than just your services
(pause) This is simply a reflection of my appreciation
(vulnerable he likes her) would like to ask you something personal
His phone rings, he frowns slightly and answers it
(') Not now Victor,  am busy
Uri turns
There, casually resting on the floor is his painting, his lucky painting
Uri's expression changes, his world has been shattered, he's thinking very ugly thoughts
He turns back to Stella, dead pan
(') very nice painting
How long have you had it
little caught off guard
Years, it's my lucky painting,
it's very special isn't it
Beauty is a cruel mistress, is it not
Pause, she smiles
Uri talks back into the phone, the other darker Uri is now in charge
(') Victor please, come to join us
