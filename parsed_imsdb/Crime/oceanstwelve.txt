The cart and wagons we were following disappear into a maze of synchronized activity

The striped tulips fetch a very high price

It means the flower developed a virus early in the bulb stage
The flaws create the unusual coloring
Can you arrange something for me with those
Of course

Now we  the customer:
Well, it's for my parent's anniversary
They don't know 'm coming

Take your time, please
And thank you
The Owner moves toward a corner of the store where the flowers are arranged
Tess walks around, looking at the rest of the store
Tess looks out the window

Almost immediately, his expression clouds
He looks at his watch

Rusty makes another turn

(

Rusty pulls to a stop light
The Cadillac pulls up three cars behind him
Let me ask you something: When Christo calls his cotton supplier and asks for 100% cotton cloth, do you think his supplier sends him 98% cotton and 2% polyester and when that doesn't work, says to Christo, "Well, you should have told me you were going to wrap the coast of Australia"

Felix, you're in a shame spiral
Have your assistant lose my number
Rusty snaps his phone shut

Rusty looks into the rear view mirror and then slows the car to a stop
He gets out of his car and slams the door shut
He walks back to the Cadillac and knocks on the window

Livingston strides off stage as we see that he is at the Bellagio, in the lounge
Benedict and the Power Twins are waiting for him
Somehow he isn't surprised

You've been very patient
What can  say

Right at Danny
And they are not happy
The group is in an abandoned  somewhere near
Danny is overwhelmed, like a deer caught in the headlights
He throws a desperate glance at Rusty, who's looking out the window serenely, letting Danny flounder

Everyone just stares at Danny, waiting for an answer
How many can't make the deadline
Everyone raises their hands except Reuben
(off their looks) So 'm smarter than those schmucks on Wall Street
Whose fault is that
Fair enough
How many think if they run, they'll be found

Danny steps back
Danny's tone draws everyone's attention
Noticing this, Danny and Rusty move into a nearby dilapidated office doorway

Rusty takes his headphones off and exhales
Danny notices this and does the same
After a beat: Call me an elitist asshole, call me a bourgeois clown, call me anything you want, but 'economy' is bullshit
Oh,  don't know
it's not that ba- The guy in front of Danny moves his seat back suddenly and spills Danny's drink all over Danny's lap
Linus approaches Danny and Rusty
Hey
You guys have a minute
Sure, Linus
What's on your mind
Well,  know this may not be the exact right time to bring this up, but 've been thinking about
well, about where  want to be in five years, career-wise, and 've decided  really want to be more than just a role-player really see myself as kind of an idea man, like you guys
mean, know you do your part and you're in the trenches with us and all, but it's really your show, and like said, five years from now,  want to be running my own show

really feel like 'm ready for more responsibility and that  could really make a contribution

You feel up to taking the lead
Are you serious
Absolutely
This isn't some gag

Everyone looks at each other and turns to leave
(
) Wait a minute
That's it
Yeah
Look, you guys no frills, no perks, run-and-gun, all that stuff, and said no problem because  believed you were right that we shouldn't go deeper into debt and spend money we don't have
mean, am  the only one who thinks this might actually be a good thing
That we could use a little humility
That maybe we were a little too pleased and impressed with ourselves after the Benedict job

She/He looks to Linus, who looks to Danny and Rusty
(bailing Linus out) If animals were capable of flattery, the World Bank would be open until 8pm
When  was four years old,  saw my mother kill a spider with a tea cozy
Again, the Evelyn looks to Linus, who has nothing to say
doctor who specializes in skin diseases will dream that he has fallen asleep in front of the television
Later he will wake up in front of the television but not remember his dream
Evelyn nods and looks to Linus, as do Danny and Rusty
He furrows his brow, then speaks: let the sun beat down upon my face, stars to fill my dreams am a traveler of both time and space, to be where  have been
Danny and Rusty stare at Linus like he's nuts, like he's just cracked
Evelyn's entire expression changes
Your young friend has a great deal to learn about respect
She/He puts his/her drink down and walks to another part of the establishment

Danny and Rusty look at Linus, Thanks
What do we know so far
There's a dummy key pad by the front door
(points to a diagram) But the alarm is really controlled by the keypad in Mr
Vanderspeigle's second floor office
Now, here's good news: we already know the system's master code
Evelyn gave it to us
That's not good news, that's really good news
We just wait until he leaves
Yeah, well
that's the bad news
He doesn't
Frank flinches
Doesn't like what he's hearing
He's agoraphobic

He can't get a clear shot of the target
In fact, he can't see it
He turns to Saul
Let me see the specs
Saul pulls a well-worn copy of the alarm system blueprint
Basher goes to the height of the alarm keypad in the bedroom
It's 4' 10"
How tall is the surface of this roof
About 87 feet
How tall exactly

Try me
We don't have line-of-sight
What
We tried everywhere
Some places we're only three or four inches off
but
there's no straight shot
Even with Basher
It's literally impossible
Linus enters, out of breath
Seeing everyone, he goes to Danny and Rusty
Can  talk to you guys for a second
They nod and allow Linus to pull them into the corner
Linus looks over at the group and then turns to 'them
Listen, 've done a little research on the Schuman Special, and uh
we don't have line of sight for the shot
What
Jesus
This'll kill us

This like running toward a cliff
Speaking of which, how's Isabel

You get the tattoo removed
Given its location, my doctor advised against it
Rusty stops walking
Danny continues, then notices he is alone
He turns back to Rusty
What are you doing
We're here
Oh
As Danny and Rusty enter the hotel, Rusty trips on the steps
Nice
Rusty bends down to look at the step
He notices that one tile on the edge of the stop has lost some mortar
He touches the tile and watches the lip rise up and down, up and down, as though it's cantilevered

Tilt it

The whole house
It's only a few inches
Then 'll have line-of-sight
We can't tilt a whole house
They did it with the Leaning Tower of Pisa
Exactly
It took three hundred guys two years to do that
You're crazy
Nobody's ever done anything like this
Not true
Palowski did it in `64 in Venice and `73 in Istanbul
Really
And he only had a crew of six
There are thirty pylons
We cut them, insert the jacks, and crank
For nineteen hours
Here's the order in which they have to be done

From across the canal, we  towards Vanderspeigle's house, favoring a barge moored just out front
Then, instead of moving over the barge, we its hull to-- 57
57 Frank and Livingston inside manning a series of industrial water pumps
They're grimy and covered in sweat
Rain drips through the deck above them
So, Basher approached me about being on a crew
When
Yesterday
Frank thinks about that
Yen pops his head out from a small tube and says something in Chinese
Frank shrugs
doesn't understand
Yen tries again
This time he enunciates very clearly and talks very loudly (like Americans do when foreigners don't understand English)
Frank nods, starts turning the handle of the water pump in the opposite direction
Yen climbs down out of the tube
Then he climbs back up the tube
He picks up a jack in the corner
Climbs back in the tube
58
'  -                      58 We  him as he climbs through the tube and emerges underneath Vanderspeigle's house, inside its foundation
The thirty pylons extend from the base of the house into the into the swamp it sits atop of
There is little space between the swamp level and the house
Runoff from the rain outside drips everywhere

They are covered in muck and grime The good news is, after the first twelve hours,  stopped being able to smell anything
Took a few more for me
This water was stagnant six hundred years ago
the Malloys, thirty feet away, using a fancy underwater saw to cut a space in another pylon
Because the cutting is taking place underwater it is extremely quiet
There's no reason for him not to
He would go to the cops
Okay, so he goes to the cops
Then they arrest Dominique
Right
Then we have no story
Right
She steals the money from Mr
Mulroney
They turn to look at Linus, sawing nearby
What
Why would she

58   : (2)                                               58 To pay Franklin to keep quiet
Turk and Virgil think about that
Linus keeps sawing
That's good

Counterfeiting
Me

It's cheating
It is cheating
There's no subtlety to it
It's kind of embarrassing
No one  know
can't imagine anything like that
long beat
Then each of them reach into their jackets and produce $20 bills
They exchange and examine the bills closely by eye
Satisfied, they trade them again and return them to their coat pockets
Not bad

When are you gonna stop with that tired "white people can't be funny stuff"
It's so old, Frank, really
Do you want some orange juice got the good kind
Just then they are interrupted by Danny's voice on a walkie- talkie

With her on stage are a couple of seated -
She's nervous
Let's discuss, briefly and to begin, with the category of "thieves", as distinguished from the larger category of what might be termed "hardened" criminals
The highest level, "master thieves," if you will, is a very small world
Between six and ten high-level crews are operating in Europe at any given time
Worldwide, no more than twenty
The most famous, Gaspar LeMarc, is either dead or retired, and the expectation is that no one will replace him
The good news is the trend is toward their extinction

For example: Anecdotal evidence suggest these people are personally insufferable
The Higher-Ups look at each other; what did she just say
Their egos demand constant praise, and they embellish their exploits to anyone who will listen
They tell their own stories endlessly, provided of course, they are talking to a fellow thief or an intimate
Many in the audience are now looking to each other, wondering if this is appropriate
Those who interact with them on a personal level are relegated to positions of total servitude, with no chance for growth or freedom
Their lives are treated as secondary
Many of them suffer from depression
It's a crime for which there is no law, and yet causes untold damage
One of the Higher-Ups convinces the other to say something, but by now Hess the Male Secretary has reached Isabel and interrupts her by whispering into her ear
She balances
(cont'd) (amplified by the lectern mic) 66
--   --                 66 Isabel and Hess walk briskly through the ultra-modern hallway

Then something he says stops her in her tracks

Then he pulls out some
Isabel leafs through them

Thanks for coming
We can really use your help on this one
His partner looks over at Isabel, who is wearing a skirt and pretty damn good shoes
The guy checks out her legs and looks away
hope the scene hasn't been contaminated
Isabel walks away
Moments later, she enters the house with the lead detective
68
-                              68 As soon as she's inside she's all business
No forced entry
Not that we can find

Behind a fake bookcase is a small room which contains the safe
In the other direction is Vanderspeigle's bedroom
(nods) We can't figure out how they disabled the alarm
We thought maybe they tried to short it out somehow

69   :                                                 69 No, that would have triggered the system
Isabel goes to the alarm pad
Pulls the face plate off, examines the inside
(cont'd) And damaged the circuits
Well, then  don't know how they got in
They had to have known the code
She moves on to look in the mark's
(calls to her) We considered that, but the mark swears that nobody in the world knew the code except him
He programmed the last seven steps of the system himself
He set it and never left the house again
When he dies, we'll probably have to physically cut all the power lines to the house to get it off line
Isabel examines the computer brain of the alarm system which was locked inside a titanium case in Vanderspeigle's bedroom closet
She answers the detective almost as an afterthought
There are other ways to get the code
(to herself) Closed loop
Redundant servers
Titanium encasement
Not bad
The lead detective enters the bedroom
Like what
Again, Isabel is inside her own mind
She's really just answering the detective's questions out of courtesy
() 46
69   : (2)                                                69 Uh
well, they probably set up in a house across the canal and watched him type the code in through a pair of binoculars
We    as he walks back into the office
He stands at the alarm panel and pretends to type in the code
He twists around and looks out the window behind him
(calling to Isabel in the bedroom) Actually,  don't know about that
Isabel re-enters the office
(cont'd) Unless he had a habit of typing in the code like this-- He stands to the side of the panel and reaches over to type in the numbers
It's an obviously unnatural position
Then he moves in front of the panel and types in the code as one normally would
(cont'd) --then his body would block the view from across the canal
That's why they probably set up over there-- She points out an adjacent window on another wall
(cont'd) --And used the mirror
She points at a small mirror on the opposite wall
The detective bends down so his eye is at the level of the keypad, then he looks in the mirror
He can see directly across the canal into another house
(cont'd) 'm guessing they'd need a fifteen hundred millimeter lens to get a clear shot but-- But Isabel's already moved on
Something has caught her attention just above the alarm panel: a patch of paint that is shinier than the paint that surrounds it

When she pulls her finger away there is paint on it
Isabel cocks her head

What is it
Isabel uses the blunt end of a letter opener from Vanderspeigle's desk to gently dig at the wall under the paint
The plaster there is soft and wet
In fact it isn't plaster at all
It's spackle

Isabel cooks her head again

The one that Vanderspeigle leaves cracked open every night
Isabel looks across the canal at the apartment where Basher and Saul were playing cards
They would have fired from that roof
Through this open window
Isabel kneels down, checks the line-of-sight to make sure she's correct
From that roof, through this window
Nobody could make a shot like that
Not a cop, anyway
What's that supposed to mean
Sorry
Your friend downstairs put me in a bad mood
He's an idiot
You shouldn't let him bother you
Yes
You're right
Isabel pulls out a notepad and writes the name: "Eugene `Basher' Tarr
" There are two names above Basher's in her little book: "Robert Ryan" and "Danny Ocean

Even when they make mistakes

The wires run back to the window of the apartment across the canal
Inside that apartment: the wires end in another tiny wheel which is mounted on a large tripod for stability

Livingston attaches a device designed to fit directly over the number pad of Vanderspeigle's keypad to the "clothesline" that runs across the canal
75      --                                  75 Isabel writes: "Livingston Dell
" Underneath Basher's name in her notebook
76   '  () --                           76 Livingston's device is shuttled across the canal, through Vanderspeigle's cracked window and right to the alarm panel
Magnets on the side of the device cause it to snap into place over the top of the keypad
Livingston then types a six- digit code into a remote keypad
His keypunches are mimicked by the remote device
Vanderspeigle's alarm shuts off
Downstairs: From inside we see the front door lock picked
The door swings open
77      --                                  77 Isabel nods her head
There's a slight smile on her face
The smile of admiration, respect in another's skills
When did he get up and notice the certificate was gone
The alarm woke him at 4:2O am
But the alarm would have been-- She stops
And smiles to herself
(cont'd) Oh
Oh,  know what happened
What
Isabel quickly glances around the room
Her eye lands on the floor near the false bookcase

77   :                                                   77 On some dark lines in the crevices where the floor boards meet
She kneels down for a closer look
There was someone else
Someone else
78   '  () --                        78 Danny and Rusty come through the front door
They are followed by Linus
All of them are soaking wet from 24 hours in the swamp under the house, and the last few minutes in the pouring rain outside the front door
The group silently slips up the stairs
(
) Oh,  wish  could've have seen that
79
-                            79 They enter Vanderspeigle's office
You can hear him snoring in the other room
Danny and Rusty quickly, carefully remove the crossbow bolt from the wall and take it to the window
They drop it (and the attached wires) to the Malloys, who are waiting on the street below
Meanwhile Linus spackles the hole in the wall and paints over the spackle
Danny and Rusty turn to see that Linus is finished
They hand-signal each other like Special Forces guys do, then move towards the bookcase on the adjacent wall
(
) That must have really been something
Suddenly: Wait
Wait
Shhhh
Everyone freezes
Danny puts his hand up to his ear to try to listen for the sound he thought he heard
We hear the faint sound of somebody singing to themselves
Danny and Rusty quickly realize it's coming from behind the bookcase
What the hell
() 51
79   :                                                      79 They yank open the false bookcase to reveal a handsome Frenchman who has just finished cleaning out the contents of Vanderspeigle's safe
Danny and Rusty stare at him
He turns around and sees them, but if he's bothered in the slightest he sure isn't showing it
Danny approaches him
This exchange is whispered with a great amount of drama at very close range
Can  help you
Yeah
What the hell are you doing
am getting here first
Just then, Frank and Yen arrive
The Frenchman looks them over
This is our score
am here before you
(joining) We let you in the house
Somehow you got in after we hit the code but before we got to the door
That's thirty seconds
How could know which exact thirty seconds had
Unless  knew you plan
Could have known your plan
Do you have a snitch in your group
No
We don't
Yes,  know you don't
Because saw, the whole thing from that chair
knew you were around, but  had my own plan
Yen says something in Chinese

79   : (2)                                              79 There's really no need for that
Danny wants to raise his voice, but he can't
Vanderspeigle is snoring twenty feet away
Listen, we have to come to some arrangement
We've incurred some very serious costs here
Danny and Rusty look at him
Well, we have
The Malloys arrive
Every second  am becoming more outnumbered
(whispering, re: Dinner Jacket) Who's this
He said he got here first
That's bullshit
Hey
Mouth
This is our goddamned job
He sounds as angry as a guy who's whispering can sound
If the situation were reversed-- But the situation is not reversed
The situation is that  am here first, without any help from you

79   : (3)                                                 79 Livingston arrives, soaking wet like everyone else
So as much as  would-- Basher and Saul arrive
Jesus, how many of you are there
Just give us the stock certificate
Whatever else you took out of that safe
it's yours
Dinner Jacket stops
Thinks for a moment
Then: No
But:  leave you with something
He hands Danny a business card
My attorney
In case Evelyn's employer tries anything
well, anything
Dinner Jacket smiles, then pulls a tiny electronic device out of his shirt pocket
He presses a button
And the alarm blares to life
80      --                                 80 Paul stares at Isabel
Are you sure
'm sure there's another scenario that would fit these physical details, but  don't know what it is
Where should we start
Isabel takes out her , writes something on her keypad, and hits a few buttons
second later, Paul's  goes off
() 54
80   :                                               80 You can start by picking that guy up

--                        81 The group sits around looking depressed
Who the hell was that guy
It's going to get out, you know
People are going to find out
Somebody must know this bloke's name
The question is who trained him
He got into that place alone
He says
believed him
(unsettled) You think he's better than us
'm not saying anything, but the man was sitting there, waiting for us
Do you think the cops even know who this guys is
Please
That guy's never even seen a cop
Maybe he works with the cops
() 55
81   :                                                 81 You don't work with the cops unless you absolutely have to
And not even then
Either way, he's got to have a name
It can't be that hard to find out who this guy is
Like  said, somebody trained him
Who trains the best
LeMarc
(to Rusty) Right
If he's not dead
Who's LeMarc
Stunned silence from the guys
They won't even respond
Yen says something
82
--                            82 Isabel arrives
83
--                            83 Isabel is waiting to be processed
Eventually, she is directed down a hallway
84
--                         84 We  through a one-way mirror into the interrogation room where detectives Onderdonk and Devenpeck are trying the bad cop / bad cop routine on Evelyn
Isabel walks   and watches: Onderdonk slams his fist on the table
Davenpeck shouts in Evelyn's face
Evelyn just laughs

84   :                                                    84 Isabel shakes her head
Frustrated and more exhausted than their detainee, the two detectives leave the interrogation room for the ante-room where Isabel is
Fucking stone
'm not quitting
Who said quitting
'm tired
Can  speak to him
The two detectives look at each other
Who are you
Isabel produces a signed document
They look at it, shrug, and give it back
Apparently, you can do whatever you want with him
Are you moving him
Oh no
just need to speak with him
To get some information
We've been on him for six hours
With our best stuff
Our best stuff
In mind terms, we've been torturing this guy
'm sure
only need a moment, then 'll be out of your way

Isabel goes into the room with Evelyn
We Onderdonk and Davenpeck, who watch her through the two- way mirror
: Isabel walks right up to Evelyn, smiles, and whispers one word to him/her
Evelyn's face freezes
He/she looks at Isabel, scared
Then he/she starts to weep
Uncontrollably
Tears stream down his/her face
Isabel hands Evelyn a sheet of paper and he/she begins to write
Onderdonk and Davenpeck are dumbfounded
Isabel turns around so she's facing them
85
--                           85 The entire group, minus Danny, sits around glumly watching International on the flat screen
Danny is on his cell phone on the other side of the room
( ) It's not a problem, it's a hiccup
It won't affect our schedule that much
want to talk about you, not the job
How are you doing
--
Something about it doesn't sound familiar
Danny moves into the big roam
Rusty is at the door, looking through the peep-hole
Rusty puts his head down
Clearly it isn't a stranger
Tess, 've got to call you back
He hangs up

Rusty indicates for Danny to get it
Coming
Danny opens the door to reveal
She looks at Danny
He looks back at her
They don't say a word
Danny motions for her to come in

(to Rusty) Hello, Robert
Rusty spins to see Isabel
Isabel
He crosses to her
with the group for a moment
"Robert

Virgil and Turk shrug
How does she know that
Ex-girlfriend

It's great to see you
Is it
Because you've been seeing a lot of me lately
She hands a surveillance photo to Rusty
You were sitting in a Mercedes outside my apartment on Wednesday night
She hands Rusty another photo
(These are the photos Hess the male secretary showed her at Europol  that we couldn't see
) () 59

She hands him a third photo
Looks at the fourth
This one
'm not even sure where this one was taken, but  like it a lot
Very Ron Gallela
She hands this photo to Danny
It's a picture of Rusty, with a dorky look on his face, peering out from behind a mailbox he's using as cover while he spies on Isabel
mean, if  didn't know better 'd think you all came here to steal the Vanderspeigle Getuigschrift, also known as the world's first stock certificate
(to the group as a whole) You must have been so proud of yourselves
Schuman Special
It's been awhile
(smiles at Basher) That was a very handsome crossbow shot, Eugene
Basher winces at the sound of his real name
The group stares back at her
Can't believe this is happening
And the Palowski
whose idea was that
She knows it was Rusty
We didn't steal anything
Oh
know you didn't
Somebody beat you to it
One man
No crew
No back up
Tell me something -- just so  can get the full picture in my head -- was he wearing a tuxedo
white dinner jacket

You'll never see this guy your whole life
So you know who he is
Of course we know who he is
Well, then
'll see you when you see him
To get your certificate back
She takes the photo of Rusty peeking from behind the mailbox from Danny's hand
She walks out
The group is frozen
Livingston is still looking at the pictures of Rusty following Isabel
(to Rusty, re: the photo) Who's hat is that
How did she-- That was-- (to Rusty) This is what  was talking about
This is exactly what  was talking-- -- was just checking up on her knew she didn't want to see me was being polite
Where did she learn all that stuff
The Palowski stuff
Her father
He was a cop
Thief

Very
Great
What's the big deal
She's just some brilliant, pissed-off ex- girlfriend who's dad taught her every trick in the book
& Fiancee
But did you see that display of emotion, handing out those pictures
Totally unprofessional
She's passionate
She's unbalanced
Her job is very stressful
She could reduce her stress by leaving us alone
We've got to slow her down
Everyone agrees
But first: We find our French friend and introduce ourselves

Why get into something with him
He's young and he's filthy rich, and he's got time on his hands
We don't want to become his Betty noir
We can just fence his painting and earn a lot more than we would have from the certificate
It's about reputation
You said so yourself
We have to get that certificate to Evelyn's buyer or-- We'll make enough selling the Degas to pay off her buyer-- Then why did you make that trip down there in the first place, if you didn't want to get into something
Saul
Turn his name over to Isabel
In exchange for getting off our backs

112

The secure box is loaded onto a plane as Isabel and her male secretary Hess exit a plane nearby
114
--                                              114 Isabel and Hess heading into Paris
Why do  need to see all these guys
When  tracked the Munch down in Sweden  got all the approvals  needed with one phone call

What's so goddamned special about the French
Hess gives her a look as though she should know better
Without their signatures, you can't do anything
You can't pull the suspects over, you can't do surveillance on them, you're not even allowed to contact them
They're real sticklers about sovereignty issues here
115
'  --                        115 The Bureaucrat looks at Isabel
All of her
Isabel,  couldn't possibly sign those documents in good conscience without talking to you about the case in detail
realize you're in a hurry and my schedule for the rest of the day is quite full, so perhaps, if you're interested in being expedient, we could discuss the case
over dinner
116
--                                            116 Isabel sits in the back with Hess
Foucquet's at eight-thirty
Apparently their's a private room
Better bring your kevlar

No
They walk on
Very theatrical of you
asking to meet here
Like we're spies meeting to do an exchange
Why are you doing this to us
Doing what
This is a game for you
For us it's survival
Are you that bored mean
No
wouldn't do that
No
The truth is
made a bet
Or maybe a better word is a "wager"
What kind of wager
118
--                                    118 Danny and Toulour sit across from each other
The bottom quarter of the Eifel tower is visible in the background
gentlemen's wager with a friend of mine -- my mentor
few months ago we were at his winter place in Nicaragua and another guest referred to me as "the greatest thief in the world
"  didn't object, obviously, but my mentor fell silent
Later  asked him about it
He said if  really wanted to say  was the best thief
'd have to prove  was better than the eleven of you
(beat) () () 76
118   :                                               118 (cont'd) You know, the Benedict job made waves, even all the way over here
16
3 million dollars
That's a lot of money
163
Sorry
163
Before you were found
119
--             119 Yes, 163 million is a lot of money
It attracts attention
So, in a way, you brought this problem with me on yourselves
You're victims of your own success
Here's what 'm going to do
You tell me the name of your mentor
'll call him up and 'll tell him that you're the greatest thief in the world
that  accept that to be true
And in return
you leave us alone, let us go about our business
How about that
He said you'd probably say something like that -- but he said you'd probably have your fingers crossed when you said it
Danny frowns, pulls his hand out of his pocket
(') So in this situation -- for the purposes of my wager -- words aren't good enough
have to prove this on the ground
This mentor of yours
was he a good thief in his day
Who, LeMarc
() 77
119   :                                             119 Danny swallows
Yeah
Him

--                            120 Angle on the group -- they're slack-jawed
Who
Yen says something
thought so too
LeMarc
The LeMarc
Danny nods
God hates me
He hates all of us
Hell, this could go on forever
No
It's going to be settled by one more job
single object
Whatever it is, let's just let him have it
We can't
Because of pride
Because we beat him, he'll pay Benedict off
stunned beat

120   :                                             120 One score, for the whole thing
What do we have to do
mean, is it a fair bet or is it like
the Coronation Egg or something
Danny points
That's it
That's the one
He wants us to steal the Coronation Egg
That's just
that's
what is that
The Holy Grail
Carl Faberge, the greatest goldsmith in history, constructed the Coronation Egg in 1896 for the wedding of Czar Nicholas and Alexandra
Every world class thief in the last 108 years has tried to steal it
No one has even come close
That's because it's cursed
What
It's un-stealable
It's the only thing in LeMarc's entire career that he went after but failed to get
He tried three times
long beat of silence
We get the egg and we're free

120   : (2)                                              120 That's great, except we can't get it
It's not possible
Then we go to jail

where is it now

In a nearby sedan, Isabel sits next to an Italian of same sort
Hess is in the front seat
'm going to need surveillance on both hotels, phone taps, room bugs, people in the lobby and by every exit
Yes, absolutely
If  had to guess 'd say 'll need at least 25 people, a dozen vehicles
and an on-call air unit
Yes, absolutely
Okay, one more thing, and this is crucial: these guys are extremely, sophisticated at avoiding electronic surveillance, so we'll need real state of the art stuff

Yes, absolutely
Okay
Good
Now what time am meeting Captain Giordano
beat
(tentative) Yes
No, what time
Another beat
Yes
absolutely
Isabel looks right at him
see
so
you've spoken with the Pope and he's okay with autographing my breasts
Hess turns around
Yes, absolutely
Isabel sighs loudly and sinks back into her seat

Danny is standing next to him
What am  looking at
TR354 infra red motion detection system
It's the gold standard
Saul and Linus back yet
No
No
And  can't find Rusty

The door has a complex double-locking mechanism that would make it impossible to pick
Yen says something in Chinese
What
Yen says something in Chinese, again
Well,  don't know, but that's one nasty lock
Danny approaches
Seen Rusty
We thought he was with you

Not since we first got here
About an hour ago
Danny moves away

127
--                                  127 Isabel enters her room
Suddenly she spins and draws her pistol
Her gun ends up in Rusty's face
Jesus, Robert
could've killed you
He shrugs
long beat as she takes a look at him
'm older
hope so
What are you doing in my room
thought maybe we could get some coffee
No, thanks
Okay, how about a two week trip to Zanzibar
Please don't
() 83
127   :                                             127 Fine, coffee then
Whatever you say
Isabel gives an exasperated sigh
Why do  want to have coffee with you
How should  know
sorry about your mom
Isable nods
(cont'd) She was a real
She hated you
Well, she was nice enough to hide it from me
Some people can't even do that
She hated everybody
Rusty nods
He remembers
You'll never get it by the way
Get what
You'll think you've got it, you'll be so close that you'll be able to taste it and then this guy, the Night Fox or whoever he is, will just take it -- right out of your hand -- just like he did in Amsterdam
He's as good as LeMarc
It's not possible
You're in a bubble

dummy egg sits on a cradle in the center of the room
Infra-red motion detectors cover the room
Motion sensitive lasers shine directly onto the egg
Danny, Basher, Yen, Frank, and Livingston try to figure out how to get around the security systems
(  ) No, that won't work either
The will pick it up before you even get close
This is depressing to everyone
Look, if we're having this much trouble, and we've got ten guys Toulour must be pulling his hair out

Rusty strides in
Everyone looks at him
He looks at the mock up of the egg
Would you call that bubble-shaped
What
Rusty shrugs it off
She pulled a gun on me
He sits

Are you back on
'm selling
She ain't buying
More importantly, what kind of reception is the Italian Police giving her
131
--                         131 leads Isabel down a hallway
Captain Giordano is handling an urgent interrogation
He'll be up as soon as it is completed
Please wait in here
He leads Isabel and Hess into the Captain's office
large clock on the wall reads 11:45 am
The open windows in the office look out onto one of Rome's famous courtyards
Captain Giordano stands with three other officers
They are having a loud, tense conversation in Italian
Isabel watches as Giordano's temper really flares
He jabs his finger at one of the other cops
() Naples sucks
They're a joke
The only decent player they have is Pasqualli -- and he's a pussy
1 () Pasqualli runs circles around Bologna's backfield every time
2 () Pasqualli could single-handedly-- Isabel turns to the officer who escorted her in
What are they talking about

Isabel and Hess look at each other
132
--                                        132 The Captain continues to argue
Those involved in the discussion are being brought lunch

Their mock-up alarm rings
red light flashes
Damn-it
Danny rubs his face
This is feeling impossible
He goes into the corner and clicks a walkie-talkie
in the background we see Rusty trying to keep everybody's spirits high
All right, okay
Let's not be defeatists
What about that mirror trick that Akimbo tried at the-- --There's no mirror thin enough to avoid tripping the lasers

What's he doing now
(
) Nothing
Just reading the papers at a cafe
Oh, no, wait
woman just sat down next to him
He's getting her phone number
(
) Wow
What are those

) Jimmy Chu
(
) 've never seen that color

Isabel looks over at Hess, who is still asleep
136                                                   136 Isabel and the Captain are alone now
Giordano is looking right into her eyes, with laser focus
There isn't even a hint of lasciviousness about him
He's all business
reason to believe these men
(lays out photos of Danny, Rusty, and Toulour) are going to try to steal the Coronation Egg when it is actually put on display next week
need official authorization to surveil and pursue these suspected criminals on Italian soil
Yes, absolutely
And 'll need substantial resources from your department
Can  count on that
Yes, absolutely
Isabel stops
Starts to wonder
So, Captain, what do you think of my skirt
He smiles and looks at her
think it's very beautiful
Why, don't you like it

For you  make an exception
Thanks
think it's good that we talk
You see, you should stop following me
You're wasting your time
'm going to let you go first and get caught
Then they will increase the security even more, and then  will steal the Egg
Then Lemarc can make his decision
You sound confident
Confident
This is a very American word
am arrogant
There's a difference
Doesn't matter if you're that good
Are you that good
can move objects with my mind
Danny just looks at him
You don't believe it
Do you
Are you done stirring your sugar
Danny stops, lifts the spoon
It's completely
That's fantastic
(starts to go) Listen,  appreciate the call, and, best of luck

'm serious
Sit down, please
Danny site down and looks at him
You're telekinetic, is that what you're telling me
Yes
But
it's a curse nightmare
Everything is too easy
But then LeMarc says 'm still not the best
So  take his challenge
And you will fail, and  will win, and so what
What does it prove
What is he trying to show me
Danny just looks at him

Lahiri, you're in Italy now
We are a sovereign nation
We're not some adjunct, some administrative district of the
When Europol calls we don't jump up and tap dance for you
If you want to work in Italy, then you have to do it under Italian authority
and that means you have to talk to Commander Andriotti
who, 'm sure, will be happy to meet with you some time next week-- Next week

Sorry  fell asleep
We both did
'm exhausted

piece of music comes over the cafe loudspeaker that catches Isabel's attention : 141   '                                         141 Years ago
Isabel's sitting at the very same cafe reading the newspaper when she hears frantic police whistles
She looks up to see a man running down the street at full bore
As he gets closer we realize it's Rusty
Eight cops are chasing him
Rusty rushes past the cafe
As he does he notices Isabel, they make eye contact
Then he's gone
Sprints around the corner
The cops rush past her
She hears sirens converging from all directions
142
(  )             142 Isabel shows her Europol identification to a detective
Hi, this isn't official business
Actually, 'm here on vacation
But was sitting in a cafe this afternoon, near the Piazza Navona and
the police were chasing someone on foot
was just wondering if you caught him or
do you know anything about that case

142   :                                                   142 know the case, yes
Unfortunately, we didn't catch him
Oh
143
-  ( )     143 Isabel sits in the same seat the next day, reading the newspaper, enjoying her vacation
She looks up and stops cold
Rusty, all cleaned up now, dressed in a perfectly-tailored suit, sits down three tables away from her
She stares at him
Can't believe it
The brazenness
The audacity of this guy
Rusty doesn't seem to have a care in the world as he chats easily with the waiter, in Italian
Finally, Isabel just can't help herself
She gets up and walks over to Rusty's table
Excuse me
Yes
Um
Did
think  saw you
yesterday
Oh yeah
The police were chasing you
You sure your eyes aren't broken
'm quite sure it was you
Well, then 'm not gonna argue
Can buy you a coffee

Hello
We've got to stop meeting like this
She turns
He's sitting at the table behind her

The waiter's in the midst of an animated discussion in Italian with one of the customers
What are they talking about all the time
Soccer
(translating) He doesn't like Naples
thinks they're a bunch of
sissies

(off Isabel's nod) Will you come to Zanzibar with me on Friday
Stop it

The group breaks into applause startling Danny awake
We did it
It works

The door swings open and Isabel strides in, catching him completely off guard
She thrusts a piece of paper in his face
What's that
An order signed by Commander Andriotti instructing you to "provide any and all support that Agent Lahiri requests, whenever she requests it
" He looks at it
It's good, yes
Okay
He looks at her
That's a very nice blouse you wear today

When Dominique goes back with Thomas to check the trunk, the money shouldn't be in the briefcase
Franklin should have double-crossed them
That could be a great moment, when he's on the ground
And you think Thomas is going to get blown up
Hey
They look
large group of Security people are talking to some   and
Another camera here and here
And have a guard here at all times so any attempt to disable the system will be detected

If her father was a thief
why's she such a hardass
mean you'd think she'd have a little sympathy for us
When she was twelve her mother told her that her dad got arrested doing a job in Russia and died in jail
(beat) So  wouldn't count on much sympathy
"This time it's personal"
Danny looks to Rusty, who nods

Isabel stands at a police checkpoint on the road in front of the museum chatting with Captain Giordano, who's clearly brown-nosing her big-time since receiving Andriotti's order
Her phone rings
She looks at the number and answers it
What do you want
(
) Ever heard of overkill
don't even think Toulour can get it now
If he gets it, we'll let you arrest us
If we get it, you come away with me to Zanzibar-- What is your obsession with Zanzibar
Do you want to make the bet or not

'm telling you, with everything she's done in the last twenty-four hours
unless you happen to be best friends with the head of security at the museum, unless you are someone he knows and trusts enough to leave alone in the gallery, after disabling about half of their security system, forget it
We are not stealing that egg
"Someone he knows
Someone he trusts

For instance
'm talking about you know who, who looks an awful lot like you know who
Everyone looks at Danny

She's about to open it when it opens from outside
She jumps a mile until she sees that  is there, standing in the bucket from the utilities company
Hiya, Tess
Just climb on through
Try not to look down too much

Tess climbs out the ladies room window into the cherry picker basket, with Bruiser's help

Reuben -- in an anachronistic taxi driver's uniform -- is driving
There's make-up in the bag there
And some photos

Frank and Basher, as Nation of Islam bodyguards, clear a place in front of her
Reuben trails, dressed in the latest hip-hop clothes
throng of fans and paparazzi rush toward her
Strobes blind us
Fans scream out her name, thrust paper and pen at her for autographs
It's a frigging madhouse
Ms
Roberts
Ms
Roberts
Why did you come back to Rome so soon
uh
Was it to see Topher
To see what

Your co-star
Is that why you're here

Danny, your husband

Please

She takes a deep breath and exhales
She looks up at Danny, who's there waiting for her

Danny goes to her
Kisses her
Hugs her

'm not an actress, Danny
And don't look like her
You do, Tess
You really do never told you that before, but it's true
Come on: my

When did that happen
We just found out
arranged a private showing for tomorrow morning before we open the show to the public
don't understand, why do you have to disable any of the systems-- Because she might want to get close to the egg, got right up here and look at it
And 'm not going to embarrass myself or this institution by telling her she can't
She's an actress, Giovanni, not the Pope
Do you realize how much free publicity we'll get for this museum, just because she because she decided to come by and look at the egg
She's even agreed to do a photo shoot for us promoting the museum
Isabel gives an exasperated sigh
() 102
165   :                                                   165 That's exactly the sort of thing
166    --
--                            166 Saul, Frank, and Rusty sit on plush couches and watch Isabel's conversation with the museum director from six different angles
Clearly, Livingston has tapped into the museum's closed circuit system
(
) that the people 'm after will exploit
(thinks) Okay, fine
You want to shut down half the electronic system, let me post eight cops in the room
Saul, Frank, and Rusty clench teeth and fists
On pins and needles for a moment
If the museum director agrees they're in big trouble
(
) Are you crazy
That's worse than
you want me to treat her like a criminal
The guys relax back into the couches, their plan narrowly having escaped disaster
167                                                   167 On Saul, Frank, and Rusty relaxing
Only this angle has a digital quality to it -- because we are watching them now through a hi-def  screen
to  Toulour, sitting in a warehouse of his own, watching his own surveillance footage of both our guys' warehouse and the museum's closed circuit system
(
) Look, if you need to do something to reinforce security during her visit, fine
But it's got to be out of sight
And it can't effect Julia in any way
Are we clear

Virgil sits six tables away, keeping an eye on him
Turk strolls in and sits with his brother
Where is he
(points at Toulour) There
took a look at the interrogation scene
Why
'Cause Linus said it was repetitive
It clarifies everything
He said it's too on the nose
What's he, the head of the studio
What's he ever written
He's just saying -- Oh, no-- What
It's not him
Turk spine to see "Toulour" get up at the other table
Only it's not Toulour
It's somebody who looks like Toulour from behind
What
How did you-- You moron
You said you were watching him the whole time

You lost him yesterday

'   --                          169 Rusty -- the blue light of an unseen television reflecting off his face
He walks onto the balcony
170      :                            170 We follow Rusty down a hallway
He enters a dark apartment
Slips silently through the dining room
Two places are set
candle on the table is burned down to almost nothing
171
--                                     171 The lights are out here too
But Isabel's still awake
Rusty enters the room
She doesn't look at him 'm sorry
What happened
have to go
Right now
have to leave the country
It could be a while
month
Maybe more
Isabel turns to look at Rusty
She can barely see the outline of his face in the darkness
What are you saying
What the hell are you saying
Where are you going
() 105
171   :                                              171 can't tell you
Isabel stares at his dark face
When people start talking the way you're talking there are only two possibilities: you're either in intelligence or you're a criminal
And no one  work with has ever worked with you
or even knows your name
You knew what  was the day you met me, Isabel
Robert
We can talk about it when  get back
No, Robert
have to tell you something
What is it
'm taking the job
'm moving to Amsterdam
He doesn't respond for a moment
can't have this conversation right now
Please, Isabel
have to get out of here
love you
He kisses her then leaves
172
--                                  172 Outside the front of the apartment, he shuts the door and turns toward us
We see his face in the light for the first time: His left eye is swollen shut
Blood is caked into his hair and on his cheek
Somebody beat the shit out of him
106
173                                            173 Rusty is still on the balcony
There's a knock at the door
He opens it to see Isabel
You want to walk
174
--                                           174 Rusty and Isabel sit on the steps of the Campidoglio
know how you're planning to do it
know Julia's visit is the key
Who's Julia
(after a beat) LeMarc knew when to get out
He just quit
with his perfect record intact
Now he's a legend
(exhorting) Don't do this
LeMarc quit because he was 75 years old, Isabel
He was tired
His doctor told him if he didn't start taking it easy he was going to have another heart attack
You're dramatizing it
You don't know why LeMarc retired, any better than  do
You have no idea
Actually,  do
know exactly why
Really
How's that

174   :                                              174 He told me
(skeptical as hell) You know LeMarc
little
Since when
Ten years ago
For how long
For six months
You-- She's so mad she can hardly speak
You knew LeMarc
You knew LeMarc and never told me
That's the worst thing you've ever done to me
Nobody knows more about LeMarc than me
How could you do that
couldn't tell you, then
Really awful
Isabel thinks
Then why aren't you as good as Toulour
Rusty shrugs

really don't
But  will if you make me
will if you go for that egg
Rusty goes silent, looks out at the lights of the city
So many times,  waited
You can't do that to a person
Isabel-- have to go
Isabel gets up
walks away fast
She's barely holding herself together
Rusty watches her go
Several seconds, then: 175    --
--  --          175 Rusty carries a huge bouquet of flowers up the stairs to the front door of his apartment with Isabel
It's a perfect sunny day outside
He unlocks the door quietly and swings it open to see the apartment is bare
The furniture is still there
But nothing else
Nothing on the walls or the shelves
Isabel has clearly moved out
Rusty's whole body reacts
He slowly looks around him, as if in a dream
His eye goes to the dining room table
Isabel's engagement ring is there
176      --
--  --           176 Rusty is still watching Isabel, small now in the distance
She turns the corner out of sight

Isabel watches

Frank and Livingston get ready in the background
You're a photographer
Very exacting
You want things a certain way, but you never raise your voice
You're uncompromising
Strong
Reuben, what are you doing
Oh, we understand each other
'm mean, the actual words are gibberish to me, but  know what he means
There's a tone, you know
We communicate
'm sure he'd tell you the same thing

Yen says something in Chinese

say we do a Joey Heatherton, 1971
It's the wrong color
Turk looks at his watch
Damn
There's a knock at the door
They let Tess check on it
She looks out the keyhole; () 110

Tess looks back to the group and shrugs
(off) Hello
He knocks again
The group scrambles and hides
Tess opens the door
Hey
got your room number from McCormick,  hope you don't mind
He walks in and hugs her
She looks terrified
Topher disengages and looks around
This is great
Do you have the adjoining room
Uh, no
Oh
Hey
saw the rough cut of ,
It's so awesome
Congratulations
Oh
Thank you
It was just like a dub of a lo-rez output, but  could totally see what you were doing
think you might win again

Oh
It really actually looked like you were blind
How did you do that
What is it like, an on-set thing, or was it digital
It was, uh

Because if you say it's instinctual, 'm quitting right now
Seriously
The way you parted your hair
That was so connected
And that scene with the matches
And when you find out who your real grandmother is and run through the rain and find her on the porch and touch her face
Man, that was
you gotta tell Steven how much  loved it
Okay
So what are you doing
'm, uh, getting ready to go out

What movie are you doing next
'm having trouble deciding what to do next
Is Danny working

Roberts itinerary, has graciously set aside time for Ms
Roberts to view the Coronation Egg privately

182 Isabel, the Security Director, and Captain Giordano sit with four cops watching a bank of closed circuit screens
want to be on record as saying that you should have shut the entire museum down
Isabel keeps her eye on the tourists who circulate through the other wings of the museum

The assembled employees clap and call her name
She waves as they take her picture
Topher throws his arm around Julia to make sure he gets in all the shots
The Museum Director comes up to greet "Julia"

There
Right there
Isabel points at a screen showing the museum's other entrance
Rusty nonchalantly slips into the museum

Her entourage follows
It's so beautiful
My God

"" She leans in close to the egg

No

Get as close as you like
Reuben pops his head in between them
(obsequious) Julia -- unless you have any objections -- Wen and his crew set up for the publicity stills

--                      186 Rusty ponders a painting like college student trying to impress his art history professor
Finally he moves on, into another gallery
to  nine uniformed cops trailing behind him
187
--           187 Yen   -- dressed like a pretentious grunge rocker
He whispers Chinese into a bullhorn
Theoretically he's speaking to his crew (Danny, Saul, and Livingston in lame disguises) telling them where to set up the camera, lights, and flags
Each "crew member" carries an odd-looking oversized "light meter"
Upon closer examination we can see that each device has a small  screen on it -- which is tapped into the museum's closed circuit system
The guys are carefully placing their flags and lights so as to block the view of the egg from each of the eight cameras on the ceiling of the gallery
"Studio Execs," Reuben and Linus go to "Julia

187   :                                                  187 was thinking maybe we could get you and Topher into some "You Always You Never" hats and t-shirts for the shoot-- That's stupid
(instant reversal) So stupid
(turns to Linus as if it's his idea) Idiot
(gingerly) Maybe we could put some posters in the background-- don't think we want to be so obvious-- completely agree
(to Linus) Stop trying to turn this into some sort of stunt

188 Isabel struts up to Rusty
This isn't going to work
don't know what you're talking about

--           189 Yen stands on two apple boxes to shoot photos of "Julia" and Topher
"Julia" looks ridiculously stiff and keeps putting her hands up to block her ears
Topher keeps shooting glances at Danny, who is moving around flags and lights, ostensibly in accordance with Yen's Chinese language orders

Okay, thanks everybody
Thank you so much
She starts to walk out
Topher shrugs and follows her

--                                  190 Julia and her entourage barrel down the hallway
Topher catches up
Hey,  Ro, why the quick exit
uh,  have to take some pills
Aspirin
get headaches
Yeah, well, with everything thing you've been going through  can see how you'd need something
They're just aspirin
Right
've never taken aspirin in my life, ever
Can you believe that
That's amazing
For me, it's like a control thing
Well, with aspirin
it's very beneficial
Oh, yeah
'm sure
They are interrupted by the sound of   and -- all manner of alarms coming from the gallery containing the egg

She freezes
Can't move
Her bodyguards (Frank and Basher ) grab her and move her quickly out of the area

Who's in charge

She stops at an observation window and looks through it to see Danny, who is handcuffed to a chair, awaiting interrogation
His expression is impassive
She moves on to the next window: Yen
Same impassive expression
She continues down the line, Reuben, Livingston, and Saul
Each has the same impassive expression
Through the final window she sees Linus

Molly smiles sadistically
Oh, yeah
'll start with him

Isabel and Captain Giordano stand in the corner and observe
When people think of Italy they think of food, wine, the Renaissance
They don't realize Italy has the scariest prisons in the civilized world
You know why
They're all leftover from the Middle Ages
They're worse than dirty; they're damp
They're like caves
Linus can't look her in the eye
(cont'd) 'm the only hope you've got
What do you want
Testify against the others in the Benedict case
can't do that
Sure you can
You'll get a year, maybe two
The Italian charges will be dropped
You and the others will be extradited to the this afternoon

Before "Agent Starr" answers the agent in the passenger seat turns around
It's Clint Eastwood

You wouldn't have been so real

--                              199 The motorcade of  's pulls through the security gate and drives toward a  government Gulfstream parked on the flight line
Isabel watches with Captain Giordino and Commander Andriotti
Linus, Saul, Yen, Livingston and Reuben get out of the SUVs, all of them beaming
They hug Linus's mom and dad and mount the steps to the plane
Then Rusty gets out, says goodbye to everyone, and heads for Isabel
(eyes go wide) What the-- Oh my God

Don't let that plane take off
Giordano stares blankly at her
But he doesn't move
(cont'd) Do something
Do you realize what's happening
Do you understand what's going on
(deadpan) Yes, absolutely
Isabel blinks
It takes a second to hit her
Rusty approaches
Guys
Get on there before they leave without you
Thanks
(speaking like an American) Hey, no problem
Good seeing you, man
Take care
See you back home
Thanks, Scooter
Isabel is dumbstruck

His butler gets the door for him
How was Rome, air
Toulour answers by handing a small velvet bag to his butler (a bag just big enough to hold the coronation egg)
Put this in the safe, would you

She turns to Rusty
hate you
love you
This will ruin me
No, it won't
Not if you come to Zanzibar
What is it with Zanzibar
It's where LeMarc is
Rusty points nearby at another private plane
The pilot has just opened the door and put the stairs down
That one's ours
We can be there in three hours

Don't you want to meet him
He wants to meet you
You're asking me to turn my back on my whole life

'm a cop
That's who  am
You're only a cop because your father was a thief
Who died in a Russian jail
According to you mother
What does that mean
It means you should meet LeMarc

(to Danny) Let me guess, you decided you did want to give my lawyer a call
But you lost his card
Toulour holds out another card to Danny
No, nothing like that
We just came to collect our money
Not only did you fail, half of your crew got pinched
Your plan was not good
(to Tess) And you don't look anything like Julia Roberts

Danny and Tess just look at him
Something about their demeanor is troubling
Namely, that they look completely untroubled
Oh, no
You stole it on the way to Rome didn't you
stole a replica

The truck moves out of the garage and on to the street as before
This time the shot continues over to a door on the side of the building

We swing over to see Normal Looking Guy #2 looking at them
206
--                                         206 In motion
We start on the Backpack Kid, who is reading a book
The Backpack is beneath his legs
Next to him sits Across from him is one of the Normal-Looking Guys
The other Normal-Looking Guy is a row away, facing him
Linus looks at the door of the car
Is making his way through the door
He looks drunk
Looks down at his copy of the French

Puts his magazine away
Is almost to Linus's row, he stumbles a little, almost falls
Then, with a loud  the train goes completely dark
It's gone into a tunnel
We hear Saul's voice
In a few seconds, the train exits the tunnel and the lights come back on
Has fallen into the lap of the BackPack kid
Linus and the Normal-Looking Guy try to help him up
He stumbles onward and collapses into a vacant seat
(in French) He's completely drunk
The BackPack Kid nods his head
Linus goes back to his book
We drop down to see   also beneath his feet

,  --                      207 Linus walks through the terminal, backpack over his shoulder
Suddenly he stops and kneels to tie his shoelace
Saul, seeing this and reacting, splits off into another direction
208
--                                      208 Linus and Saul approach the group
What happened
Linus puts his  down
We thought someone was following us

That means

He's talking on the phone
Gaspar, it's Rusty
How are you
And this time we see what be is working on: In the warehouse in , we see Danny and Rusty "arguing", but from a different angle
They are smiling as they yell: '   ' ,
211        -                          211 LeMarc told you
Of course
He looks deflated
It's probably just occurring to him that he's never lost before
He sits down
To teach me
He is silent
Tess indicates to Danny that they should leave
Danny nods, and they rise

211   :                                                211 Well, we'll be in touch to make all the arrangements
No
Don't go
Please
Toulour gets up
You are my guests

Besides, you may have noticed,  don't like to be alone

So  think if you really analyze it, you can see that it's inevitable
It's time for us to evolve, en masse
have to help bring that about whatever way can, you know
Otherwise, the trajectory is fixed
You know what 'm saying
Mmm
Yes
But 'm through evolving, think
It's too tiring
feel pretty evolved
You know, considering

Basher and Saul tip champagne glasses
Virgil, Turk, and Linus all crack open copies of their story to read
've got an idea for another Dominique story
Can we finish this one first
Just let me tell it to you
No
It's like three sentences
'm serious; you're asking too much
Virgil puts on his headset
Turk leans over to Linus and begins to speak
Linus, reading, holds his finger up
Yen reads a magazine
Reuben glances at it
May  look at that when you're through with it
Yen says something
It would seem he is okay with that
Livingston speaks into his
(trying to be dispassionate) All in all, it was depressingly familiar
The forced camaraderie, the hollow smiles
Scared to take a moment's reflection
Scared to imagine a different life
We behaved like boys
