Haller
Not this morning

' Where are you this morning

This time Mick's in a mussed suit, surrounded by newspapers, open files, electric shaver, take-out coffee
On my way to Lancaster for a calendar call
Why, have you got something
'  () got a franchise player is what
Reaction Mick: He's heard it before
' mean it, this guy could be money
But he goes before the judge at eleven
Van Nuys by eleven could be hard-- ' But this client, listen Mick, his mother's lawyer just waltzed in -- He's already got a lawyer
-- ' Strictly real-estate, doesn't know his ass about criminal
Will you listen

So make it work for me, Mick
Don't let him use the house, get him to go for my bond-- Meanwhile the Lincoln's approaching the Lancaster courthouse, there are cars, people-- a traffic jam
To Earl-- Bring me around to the employee's gate, 'll talk my way in
(into cell, writes) 'm at the courthouse
Give me the name
' That would be Louis Roulet

That's not how you spell the wheel but  got it, thanks

" -  - with Mick through the press of lawyers, others, before the Judge shows up, as a few  are led into the holding pen-- Mick picks out his client,  , 30s, lanky, with a ponytail and skull & halo tattoo
Mick tries catching his eye but Harold's clearly avoiding him
Harold
Hard Case
( ) Don't hide from your lawyer, Harold, you know what  want to talk about
Caught, Harold slouches towards him
4
(') Listen
when the judge comes in he's going to want to know if we're ready for trial
We are
We're not and you know why not
You haven't paid me
Rule one, remember Rule one, Harold
get paid or don't work
Don't worry,  have your money
Right, you have my money,  don't
It's coming
talked to my boys
Harold--  looked at the list of people  trust, and you know what
You're not on it
The law says you can't just quit
The Judge won't let you
looked it up
Mick's about to react to this jailhouse lawyering-- when a hush falls, and the  comes out:  , 60
Pay close attention, Harold
Goes to his seat
- Harold's case has been called, Mick stands-- Mickey Haller for the defense, your honor
If  may, 'd like to carry this over
Do you have a reason, Mr
Haller
5
'm having trouble locating a witness, your honor
An indispensable witness
Mr
Green
With emphasis
look goes between the Judge and Mick
Meantime Harold stares from the pen
The Judge, to Mick-- How much time do you need
Would a week be enough
hope so, your honor
As your honor knows, Mr
Green can be hard to track down
look of understanding
Judge nods-- 'm holding this over pending notification from counsel
Then gavels down, for the next case-- As Casey's led off, Mick joins him along the rail-- He hisses-- That was bullshit, askin' for a delay--  know what that was about
And so does Judge Powell
He spent a lot of years as a defense lawyer, so he knows all about having to chase "Mr
Green," and he doesn't look kindly on defendants who don't pay their attorneys
Now do you get it, Harold
Casey won't look him in the eye--    , ' "  "-- -  () - The black town car cruises south, past dry brown hills

This is Haller
' And this is your office

'  - It's a one-bedroom in Studio City, Lorna's 33, redhead, pretty as hell, works at her kitchen table in her bathrobe, among breakfast dishes
Actually 'm in my office
On my way to court in Van Nuys
That means Val reached you about his customer
Oh yeah: "This is the franchise, Mick
" According to Valenzuela every case is "the franchise
" 'd have paid my mortgage ten times over by now-- It could be he's right
ran the name, the family's got a real estate business in Beverly Hills
The Times has them down for some big house sales, movie-star dollars
() Sounds like the media might be interested
Call Sticks, tell him to show up
Any other calls
couple of 's,  quoted them the house number
That's it, you're free after Roulet
Good
Then  can go to County lock- up
Under which Mick sees Earl indicate something on the road
while Lorna reacts to what Mick said, exasperated
7
You're going to see Gloria
Why do you waste time on her, Mickey
Mick sees where Earl's pointing:   , ,   -
They pull up alongside: gang jackets, black leather vests
Big guys
Want me to do somethin' about this
'Cause  can
Ignore them, you're doing fine
, leers at Mick through window, as Mick ignores, answers Lorna re "Gloria": (') What can  say, Lorn, 've got a soft spot for redheads
Why do you think  married you
The divorce papers called it temporary insanity
Lucky for you there was a cure
When-- Earl interrupts, insistent now-- Mr
Haller
Calling his attention to-- The leader signals Earl to pull off
Mick sees they're surrounded
Shit
-      - The Lincoln follows the Harleys off,     in a lot at the crest of the exit
Jagged rocks, craggy peaks
The leader gets off his bike
, nearly 300 lbs
Skull & halo patch on leather vest-- same as Harold's tattoo
The "Road Saints
" Mick lowers a window
Counsellor, how's it hanging
8
Fine, Eddie, how's it with you
() Hard Case called me from the pen, he said  might catch up to you
Said you're stalling his case til you see more green, is that right
If you want me to work you've gat to pay me
We paid you
Five thousand
That's long gone
could tell you half went to the aerial-photo expert
He's going to blow the state's case by showing that the violated the air space over Harold's farm by flying too low
but you don't need to know that
All you need to know is, we had a deal
Time to refill the tank
Eddie smiles
Taps the side of the Lincoln
Sure, gas-guzzler like this heard you got three more
What's one man need with four Lincolns
-- What
You want another five grand
Ten
'm flying the guy in from Kodak in New York, he wants business class
And  want Harold back on the farm
He's the best farmer we got, if you know what  mean
9
don't
And  don't want to
Either pay me my money or go with the Public Defender the judge finds you
Of course he won't know much about air space, but-- Keep your shirt on, Counsellor
We want you
He reaches into a vest with his big hand
Thick envelope
Mick takes it
Starts to count, and realizes: You had the whole ten ready
What if you'd backed me down to five
This vest got lots of pocket
Eddie taps another pocket and
one tooth missing

Six are black
Of the two white men, one's a wet-eyed, skanky , 40s
The  is a tall young man, somehow polished even in prison outfit, definitely out of place here-- Louis Roulet
turns: the proverbial deer-in-the-headlights: Scared
(') My name is Michael Haller
had a call
Yes-- Mr
Haller-- Mick stands behind a painted line three feet from the cell
Signals Louis to come to the bars to talk
Louis approaches, -- (') -- called you because  need -- 10
You want me to represent you for your first appearance
get twenty- five hundred for that
We can work out what comes next
Thank you-- This is a set-up, Mr
Haller--  made a mistake with that woman, she was setting me up-- Keep your voice down
And don't say anything about the case, not til 've got you out on bail
Okay
Mick's voice, as always, is easy and calm
Louis nods
(') understand your family lawyer's in court
That's him
Cecil Dobbs
Points to-- , balding dignified , a few rows in
Is he ready to post bail
He'll do whatever he has to
Mick nods, noting the tinge of desperation in Louis's voice
Takes out a notebook
Okay, tell me about yourself
How old are you
Thirty-two
Ties to the community
You grow up here, go to school
Both

work for my mother's business
"Windsor Estates
" 11
It's named for her second husband
How much did you make last year
(when Louis hesitates) If 'm going to get you out  need to know everything
My taxes last year said four hundred thousand
Just then, the White Junkie lurches forward towards Mick-- want a lawyer too, you got a card
They'll have one for you out there
need you to back up and leave us alone
Can you do that, pal
Junkie backs off, does just what Mick says
Impressing Louis
Then Mick, low-voiced-- (') Listen
They've put some heavy charges on you
The  will probably ask for No-Bail
No bail
Frightened voice, the others react, Mick hushes him, and
said they're going to ask it
When was the last time you were arrested
Never
So if  checked your record-- --you'd find parking tickets
Mick looks briefly into the younger man's eyes-- he's scared, fragile -- but sincere
He sputters-- 12
(') This whole thing is-- We're not talking about the case, remember
Not even to the judge
Don't  even say "Not guilty
" Today's about setting arraignment, period
You say nothing
Are you going to get me out
'm gonna try, Louis
() One more thing: There are lots of lawyers
Why pick me
remembered your name from some case in the papers
What case
drug case,  don't know
You remember the name or anything
No-- but you got the evidence thrown out against some guy-- Does it matter
(when Mick hesitates) need your help, Mr
Haller
Off Mick,  , 8  10    ' -

Nose broken

Coming up behind her-- Are you the prosecutor who used to have the Roulet case
She starts to smile-- until his emphasis registers
Don't tell me
Son of a bitch, Haller
Rules are rules
wanted this one
() Alright 'll go quietly
But after today's hearing, if you don't object
Depends
You going for no-bail
That won't change with the prosecutor
Not with what your guy did
With which she shows him the photo: gruesome
If he did it
Sure
"If
" They only picked him up in her home with blood all over him, but it's a valid question
love it when you're sarcastic
Can  at least see the arrest report
Get it from whoever takes over
No favors on this one
14
Mick looks admiringly at Maggie
At her passion
How's Hayley
beat
Off the sudden shift in topic, Maggie starts putting away the things on her desk
She's good
She likes the things you send her but would rather you show up yourself
How about this weekend
This takes her by surprise
But she takes him up on it
Okay, 'll tell Hayley
Tonight
Only Mick-- don't cancel on her

- is trained toward  in the  , he tries avoiding it
while    are Judge, there is no way the state can claim my client is a flight -- With resources like this man has, it's always a risk-- let alone the fact that the victim was brutally -- Ms
McPherson, the extent of her injuries are not the point
'm setting bail at a million dollars
Mick wins, Maggie loses
Exchange glances-- '--

Getting the door for him is his friend, bail bondsman "" , excited-- 15
What'd  tell you, Mick, we got us a franchise
We'll see, Val
There's the lawyer-guy, you get him to go for the cash-bond

Cecil Dobbs
Mr
Haller
(They shake hands
) It was depressing to see the boy caught up in that cattle call
Boy
've represented the family so long think of Louis that way
He did look a little frail
My advice is, let Mr
Valenzuela fix you up with a bond and take "the boy" home
bond
But Mrs
Windsor was thinking of putting up property
No good
Assessing it will take days
By then Louis might be carrying somebody's child
(before Dobbs can argue) So just tap Val for the bond, spring Louis, and take him to your office
We'll meet there at Four
And heads off again
Dobbs follows him out, to
16
,  - Sunlight
Where Dobbs suddenly  as he : coming out with camera
Off Dobbs's reaction-- Yep
Media's already picked us up
Mrs
Windsor's sensitive about the press
Mick, a beat
Then calls the cameraman over
When he comes-- saw you in there filming
What's your name
Rob Gillen
They call me "Sticks
" You freelancing on this, Sticks
Your client's got profile,  figure can sell it to local news
How much
'Scuse me
How much will they pay you for what you shot today
That depends
Seven, seven-fifty
Suppose we take it off your hands for eight
Sticks hesitates, like it's not the legit thing to do
(') Or do we make it a thousand
17
Sticks hesitates no longer
Takes the tape from the camera and hands it to Mick
who's already counting out money from the roll of cash Ted gave him
To Dobbs-- (') can expense this, right
Of course
Absolutely
Sticks takes the money, goes
Dobbs, impressed, beaming now-- (') 'll admit, Mr
Haller, you weren't my choice
You were Louis's
Frankly 'd never heard of you
But maybe  should have
Seems to me 've underestimated you
Then let's talk about my fees
(before Dobbs can reply) 'll need a hundred thousand up front
Working off five-fifty an hour, it'll come to another hundred thousand if we go to trial
That's estimating the trial at a week
Appeals, we start over
Mick's Lincoln pulls up smoothly to fetch him at the curb
Mick, hand on the door-- (') take it that's not a problem
Reaction Dobbs-- hesitates but has no choice
, we   '  :   2--  , () -  ,  , : ' How'd it go, Mickey
We get the case
(into his cell) We've got it if we want it
'd still like to know the state's case, what they've got on him
18
' What's the difference
'Course we want the case
Mick says nothing
Gaze out the window
Then
've got an hour til he's released
Til then 'll be at county
With Gloria
(before she says anything) Any calls
' Only Sticks
He says he owes you five hundred next time he sees you
Yeah he does
,   ,  - : Mickey Mantle
You're going to bat for me again
, redhead, 27 but good looks already fading-- greets the arriving Mick in a client/attorney booth
You don't even know who the Mick was
You don't look good, Gloria
Thanks
For coming, not for the compliment
Mick's already paging through her arrest-sheet, sees
Something new for you, getting booked on possession of coke, along with the usual
Dumb,  know
guy paid me with it,  had it on me when  went to my next
And your next was a cop
19
She shrugs/nods
Mick keeps turning pages, looking for a break
while
Can't you get me into one of those rehab places where they get you straight
We did a pre-trial rehab, last time
The
won't go for it again
You may have to do some jail here
can't
Yeah you can
They've got programs in jail, too
Look, you've had a long run
Maybe after this you can finally get out of the life
And do what
Have kids and plant flowers
Look at me
Mick doesn't have an answer
Opens a notebook, gets to work
Okay, tell me what happened
did a guy at the Travel Lodge on Santa Monica
The one who paid you coke instead of money
He had a shitload in there
saw
Which gets Mick's attention
His wheels suddenly turning
Do you know who he was
No
He reached me on my website
He was Mexican or something
20
(writes, likes this--) Did you screen him
Don't  screen 'em all
off what, his driver's license
No, his passport
think his name was, Hector, or-- Hector what
Last name
Think
,
-
'  - Moya
Hector "Arrande" Moya is what you get if you run a trace
He's Colombian, a fugitive from a Grand Jury indictment down in Florida
The  wants him for drug trafficking
The
's  : a woman, well-dressed, humorless
(') Leslie
They want him a lot
And your girl's looking to trade
She'll give you his motel and room number
She'll also have to testify on the coke
That's a No
Location only
Your guys take it from there
My investigator says Hector hasn't checked out yet
(as she weighs it) What's she want in exchange
21
You drop charges, and all she does is a Pre-trial Rehabilitation
The facility at -Med would be nice
(when she hesitates) Or do  take this straight to the Feds
Which, though veiled, is a threat
Leslie hates this
'     -   - ,
,   , lets in
Mick's checking the impressive room, vast views all the way to the Pacific, as the  enter behind him: (distinguished, 60),  (suit, silk t-shirt, Ray-bans
) Another man, 45, thickly built, enters at Mick's side
Mrs
Windsor, this is Raul Levin
Mr
Levin's my investigator
Accepting this, everyone takes their place at the long, blonde-wood conference table
Mick can't help run his hand over the surface, everything's a contrast to his own on-the- fly office
Dobbs, to Mrs
Windsor
Mrs
Windsor,  can't commend Mr
Haller highly enough for his performance in court this morning
Mary Windsor nods, provisionally pleased
have a check for you, Mr
Haller
And slides it towards him in an envelope
Mick, tries not to seem too much in a hurry as he glances inside-- , we glimpse the amount, the zeroes
$100,000
: 'm going to need that to come from your son, Mrs
Windsor
(slides it back to her) You can give him the money so he can write the check
But  want the check to come from Louis
He's my client and that's got to be clear from the start
No offense
22
She is offended-- but takes back the envelope, nods to
He takes out a checkbook, writes
Mick continues to Mary-- (') Thank you
'll expect you to support your son through this in other ways
If you're willing
Don't be silly
'll back my son come hell or high water
These ridiculous charges
That ridiculous woman
It's good to know you'll be there when we need you
But not now, is that it
We'll be going over the case
The could make you testify about what you hear
Attorney privilege doesn't cover you
Mary Windsor's motionless a moment
Rather than respond, she simply rises
To Louis-- will see you at dinner
And goes
Dobbs gets the door for her
When she's gone: My mother built a good business
From the ground up
've got no trouble believing that
(after a beat) say we get started
All agree, they sit, Mick starts up-- (') Our first choice is whether we waive our right to a speedy trial
No
want this behind me
23
You sure
You can stretch things out, enjoy your freedom
Most clients
Guilty clients, you mean
want this over
Mick's struck by how firm
Fine
We go to trial right away
Puts more pressure on the
Or maybe the case never even goes to trial
(They look at him
) Our firm's clout is considerable
Pressure can be brought to bear-- Don't kid yourself, Cecil
(to Dobbs and Louis) No way the state is dropping these charges
In fact, they've already upped them-- to improve their negotiating position
There won't be any negotiating
(before Mick can speak) No plea bargain, no nothing
'm not going to jail for something didn't do
It might not be jail
Even if  walk
'm innocent and if there's a trial  want to get on the stand and tell the jury 'm innocent
If that's a problem we can part company right now
Mick looks at the young man
Evaluating
Then
Time to tell me what happened

Check that file you've got and see if the Police report has any of this
While Raul looks, Mick explains to Louis and Dobbs, can't hide some professional pride in Raul Levin's work-- (') Raul's already worked us a little miracle
He's managed to score a copy of the discovery file, everything the
's got
They'd have to turn it over eventually but it could have been weeks
Under which, Raul's checked the blue file, and
Nope
They don't have the other guy
They don't even have the bar

He said he'd rape me and kill me

Set it up how
Put blood on my hand
My left hand
But 'm right-handed, 'd use my right if  was going to
punch someone
Which is crazy
Louis mimes throwing a punch, in the air
Inept
Louis never hit anyone in his life
What she did made sense
It's the right side of her face that was hit, she had to bloody your left
Louis: You said she opened the door a crack

Yes
So our case is, she beat herself up
Mick takes the file, takes the 8xl0s, '
(') We're saying, she pounded her face into hamburger meat, or had her boyfriend do it, hoping some far- off day a jury would give her a big fat reward
She must have
Of course
She saw his Porsche, his Rolex, it's known the family has money
'll wager she's already filed in civil court
Mick

Then, to Raul-- Okay, the police report
Let's hear how Reggie tells it

Raul reads

She falls
Louis flies down on top of her
(

) Yeah, then straddled her
"Held the victim by the neck until she agreed to cooperate
" Louis does as described, strangle-hold
Eventually lets her up, turning her toward the bedroom
And
(
) (cont'd) "The suspect maintained a position behind her, holding a knife against the left side of her throat
" , -, -  ,  ,
,
Raul takes something new from the file: Sharpened to a point
Louis looks at it
Seethes
This isn't my knife
Raul, are his prints on there
That's what the report says
'm not surprised, if she put blood on his hands she's gonna put prints on his knife
31
told you, it's not "my" knife
Mick ignores, still intent on Raul's reading
Okay, how's she say he went down
"As Ms
Campo entered the hallway, she pushed the intruder backwards into a large floor vase

And Reggie scurrying free
the fallen Louis as

But Louis

Is there anything you aren't telling me
Mick's eyes burn into him
Louis answers simply
Nothing
Mick holds him in a long, hard, assessing stare
Over which, eventually, we --- 32

It's a lawyers' hangout at this hour, others are coming/going
Quirky enough for what
To be true
Maybe it went down just like he says
(off Raul's look) Anyway there's a
chance
In a party of law-types, we  , who catches sight of Mick in the doorway
while Raul mulls what Mick said
An innocent client
Jeezus
Yeah
But you know what my father said about innocent clients
Maggie's overheard this, gives the answer
He said there's no client as scary as an innocent man
Mick, seeing her, smiles and continues, a little tipsy
That's right
Because if you screw up and he goes to prison, it scars you for life
There's only one verdict
You've got to put an
on the board
() Hey Mags
She reads the state he's in
33
Raul, if you let a man drive in his condition  think  can charge you both
The guys look at each other
Maggie swipes the keys-- (') 'll drive him to his house
And how will you get home
My friends brought me
'll keep the car, he can pick it up at my place in the morning
( ) Get in
And she gets in the driver's side, waits
Mick to Raul-- Okay, you know the moves
Make the rounds, check out Morgan's Bar
And Mr
Corvette
And Regina Campo
The way Louis says she came on's got me wondering
Mick gets in and closes the door
As Maggie starts it up and pulls away, and we  the " "  again
go to
() - Ride in silence
Then Mick, mischievous, turns on the
"God bless the dead and buried nigga, Don't worry if you see God first, Tell him shit got worse
" You've got to be kidding me
Earl lays this stuff on me
34
Where is Earl tonight
never keep him this late
Hasn't he worked your fee off yet
while ago
But he likes driving, keeps him out of trouble
He's taking courses, too, in music
You can't tell by this stuff
She snaps the rap
You get used to it
Besides, Tupac, he helps me understand my clients
Most of them go to school on his -- Not Roulet
Not Louis, no
Louis is my franchise player, he pays for all the rest
After a beat
Office gossip
heard Smithson assigned Ted Minton to your case
Never heard of him
He's brand new
Bright, though
Smithson's protegee
Naturally
Georgetown, buys his suits at Brooks, above all he's a guy
Mick looks over at her, as she flares, calms
Moonlight lines her profile
Made self-conscious by his watching her, she moves her hair from her face
Beyond pretty: Beautiful
35
Lorna made me my schedule
Saturday's fine to take Hayley
Saturday there's the Sponge-Bob movie
'm all over it
How's she doing
'll know when  drop you and get home to relieve the sitter
(catches him looking) What
Moonlight becomes you
() That's not doing me any good, Haller
' ,   -  - The Lincoln pulls up
Mick gets out but stands there
Thanks
She nods You're welcome
And pulls away
Mick's smile fades as he looks up at his dark lonely house
'  -   - : , he's just hit Play
() Daddy, Mommy said  could call and say 'night
Sorry you're not there
'night, Daddy
Me too, baby
Then Mick hits "Play" again

That too
But it's also St

day to revel in your Irish heritage
Darius doesn't get Flynn's joke
Mick cautions Darius, low-- He's an asshole but just be cool
Darius scowls
under which Mick notices that  has showed up, is trying to get his attention
while
Do you know the origin of your name, Mr
McGinley
Slave-holder,  'spect

Darius  told you-- The man's dissin' me

Raul waves to Mick, wants to talk

Darius led off by guards-- Mick, defeated, confronts Raul
What couldn't wait, Raul

They got a smoking porch out front

Giving Reggie her chance
Watch her
She passes behind Louis, trails her hand along his shoulders
keeps going out of frame
{' That's not how he said it went down
He said she gave him her address, on a napkin
' Whoa, wait, she just went to the little girls'
But she's gotta come back, no
And   -
And this time she stops by Louis, speaks into his ear, presses her body against him
Louis nods, takes something from her
Reggie kisses his cheek quickly, continues on
Rejoins  at the bar
39
, ,  - (takes it in, excited) Do the cops have this
How can they

It ain't a copy
You're exceedingly beautiful
Wait
(speeds the tape again) Reggie and  decide to split
-  , Guy takes a final swig, finishing drink
they exit frame
' Check out his hand, his watch
' It's on his left
That's no good
, , It means he's right-handed
But the facial blows were from the left
Slow down
You said you knew Morgan's
So you oughta realize
(as Mick stares) This image is in the mirror over the bar
That's how the owner set the camera to watch his register
So everything's backwards
And  punches with his left
40
told you you were beautiful
Anything else
Yeah
But it's not on the tape
You know how you were wondering about Regina
Yeah
Raul just looks at him
Off Mick, ,

Jams/wedges its way through traffic, to halt at the curb

Mickey Haller
Here to see Louis
Mr
Roulet is with someone
He can't be disturbed
It's like he doesn't hear her-- walks calmly past her-- to -- ' - Mick , finds Louis with his loafers off, on the couch with his cell-phone cradled to his ear
Robin chases behind
(') 'm sorry, Mr
Roulet, this man just came back here-- It's okay, Robin
You can go
Robin exits
Louis mutters an apology into his cell-phone and rings off
Looks annoyed at Mick
(') was setting up a showing
41
There won't be any showings in Pelican Bay
Where's that
It's a supermax prison where they send violent sex offenders
You'll fit in real good in your loafers
What's the matter
You lied to me, Louis
'm about to go and see the new prosecutor, who's doing everything he can to put you away, and now  find out you've been lying
(before Louis can deny) Tell me about Reggie Campo
What about her
've told you-- You didn't tell me
That you were going to pay her for sex
(off Louis's surprise) You think it's hard to find out somebody's not Snow White
Alright yes,  was going to pay
She wrote down a price on the napkin, four hundred dollars
Why didn't you tell me this in Cecil's office
didn't want my mother to know
Cecil tells her everything
And can we keep it down
Her office is on the other side of that door
Mick looks at Louis's concern
Believes it
Easing up
42
This changes things
You see that, don't you
'm not a lawyer
Explain it to me
Alright  will
You know that guy on the Venice boardwalk
The one who has all those plates spinning on sticks
What does this have to do with-- Just listen
bunch of spinning plates: that's the state's case
In the middle is a big one
It's a fucking platter
And if that falls it takes the others down with it
(He gets closer to Louis) The big plate is the victim
The only witness against you
knock her down, the act is over and the crowd goes home
No trial
Mick has Louis' attention now
You can make this trial go away
We've lost time
You concealed from me the fact that could do it
It comes down to why
Why what
Why would a guy with a Porsche and a Rolex need a knife to get sex from a woman who sells it anyway
The answer is, he wouldn't
And when you see that you see the set- up, the trap
And suddenly it's the defendant who looks like the victim
Louis gets it
Penitent
43
You're going to the prosecutor now
Yes
Young hot-shot named Ted Minton
He wants to give me the discovery file
Poor guy doesn't know that Raul already got it
He's new to felonies but he's no dope
When he hears his vic's a hooker he'll know we've knocked all his plates down
Then it'll be over
No promises, Louis
Louis closes his eyes, savors the prospect
Then sees Mick to the door
When he opens it:  's there
Surprised to see Haller
didn't know you were here
Is there news
There will be, Mother
And puts out a hand to Mick
Grateful
Hesitating half a beat, Mick shakes it and goes
Louis and his Mother
Regard each other
Face to face
-
' ,  - Mick in a chair
Impatient
Legal secretaries, prosecutors, etc
, come and go, when-- a guy Mick recognizes, , fat, 40, approaches a desk with a stack of papers-- Are these for
Knight
Yeah, and they're my only copies
'll wait while you copy them
'll have to ask her
But, he holds them back
Stares
She yields
44
(') 'll run them for you now
Just what  wanted to hear
She goes
Mick tries to avoid Kurlen-- but too late-- (') Well, look who's come callin'
Detective Kurlen
(re papers he dropped off) Puttin' a case away
Guy drowned his neighbor's kid in a tub to see what it felt like
It won't shock you to hear he was high
Thanks for clearing that up
If he gets San Quentin, maybe he can look up your boy Jesus Martinez
Mick bristles at this reference
Turns away again
To a : (to a passing secretary) Is Minton back yet
-- #2 He'll be a few more minutes, sir
Kurlen, seeing he's drawn blood, continues to needle
How's he doin' up there, anyway
He make the pucker-up-and-kiss-me team
haven't talked to him
guess once they plead guilty, they're not much use to you
() 45
(') (rubbing it in) He went down forever, right
He got life, but he'll be out don't know when
Too bad
'Cause his victim, Martha Renteria
She's dead forever
You don't have to remind me you were lead dick on that
Kurlen grins
Shakes his head
How's a guy like you sleep at night
With the scum you represent
Mick's had enough
Moves closer
To tell him a story
had a client once, he decapitated his ex-wife, then kept her head in the refrigerator
(--) Naturally you got him off
The
got greedy
Tried to pile on two unsolved murders, trick up evidence to stick my guy with them
It's called the justice system, we don't do things that way
So your guy's out walkin' around
He ever do it again
don't know
never heard of him after that
But he could have
Fuck you, Haller
( :) No
Fuck the
46
Before Kurlen can react--   arrives
Fresh-faced, Ivy League, 30
Mr
Haller
(Mick stands, relieved
) Sorry you had to wait
hope it'll be worth your while
He gives Mick a thin, white-covered file from a briefcase
Mick, leaving the still-sneering Kurlen behind, takes the file and follows Minton off-- tapping the file with a finger-- Looks kinda thin for a discovery -- Yes well-- We can go to my office-- 've got a question first
He takes from his pocket: Raul's
The  Raul gave him
(') You have something to play this on
'  -    - the young prosecutor's face as he watches the bar-tape
And Mick watching him for his reaction
When it's done, Ted clicks it
Not much reaction at all
What else do you have
The simple, polite question throws Mick
Look Ted, let's cut the bullshit
Not only is your so-called victim a working prostitute, but we've got her on tape soliciting my client
Maybe you're new, but you gotta know how hard it's gonna be to convince a jury a guy would have to rape a hooker to have sex with her-- 47
Nothing you're telling me's going to change my offer
Offer
You're making an offer
going forward
Not the way Mick thought it would go
Ted goes on
We'll drop the charges to Assault with a Deadly and Attempted Sexual Battery
The guidelines put him at seven years, maybe he'll do four
Mick, uncertain now, doubts himself for the first time
What am  missing here
Ted stays innocent-looking
Blank
- ' ,   - with his daughter, , 8
Mick's    near where Hayley waits on line for the next pony
approaches from the refreshment stand with an ice-cream for Hayley and one for himself
Kids playing everywhere, a chugs past
but Mick's lost in thought, his beat-up briefcase open, he's working
Got you the good stuff, Hayley
Thank you, Earl
Just then a little girl gets off a pony
The attendant holds it for Hayley
Man's got your ride ready
Go on, 'll hold your ice cream
Excited, Hayley goes
The attendant lifts her up and on, and The pony carrying Hayley joins the others in the wide ring
Mick watches her for a moment, waves-- then, balancing the ice cream, returns to his files-- 48
(') There's something right in front of me and 'm not seeing it
On his lap he's spread out:  from the  : the blue-covered one Raul gave him
The white-covered from Ted
Mick starts turning pages, compares
The same, the same
When he turns the next one over: It's the page Raul gave him showing the    , the picture we saw in Cecil Dobbs' office
Turns to the matching page from Ted's file
Reaction Mick
,
() -   - In the parking lot, pulls up
Louis is in front of the club, golf-clothes, waiting
Comes out to meet the Lincoln
,   - You said we',re going to the movies
You promised me last week
Daddy's got to talk to somebody
You stay with Earl
Mick gets out, Hayley stays
- Louis hurries over, as far from the clubhouse as possible, in order not to be seen or heard-- eager-- What's happened
Is it over
You said it would be over by now-- That was before  found out you were still lying to me
He shoves a sheet at Louis
Louis looks:    , but  from the knife-picture we saw before
49
(') You know what that is
It's a picture of your knife
The one you had on you when you went to Reggie Campos
The one the cops have
Look at the blood on the blade
Look at the initials
Louis is stuck for an answer-- (') That's why Ted Minton didn't care when  told him Reggie's a prostitute
What's it matter, when he's got a knife with her blood and your initials on it
This wasn't the knife in the file-- (scowls, sore) That's right
The file Raul got us was a loaded deck
The cops must have been on to him, because they used it to set us up
So we'd think they had nothing, when in fact they had enough to put your Hugo Boss, golf-playing ass away for twenty years
Mick looks back towards the car, parked maybe 20 yards off
He sees  in the backseat looking out
So does Louis
Mick sees him looking her way
Feeling the man's look, Hayley sits back
Out of sight moment
then Mick resumes
Cold and firm
(') Explain to me why you lied about the knife
didn't lie
said the one in the picture wasn't mine
Mick frowns/grins at the answer
(') said it twice
Nobody listened
50
() What are you now, a lawyer clever, third-rate fucking lawyer with smart-ass technicalities
"You said it wasn't yours"-- What you should have said was, " had a knife but this isn't it
" What did you think, it would just go away
(closing in on him) You brought a murder weapon to a meeting with a prostitute, Louis
How am  supposed to make that look like she set you up
1
Did
Not
Do this
Off which, Mick stares hard at Louis
At his frightened look
Then tries-- slowly-- as if for the last time-- Then kindly tell me why you went to her apartment with a custom-made knife, serrated tip, with "" engraved on the blade
always carry it
For a moment, Mick takes this in
Echoes
You always carry it
Yes
In real estate we show homes, to people we don't know
This one time
He stops
Like it's difficult
Then goes ahead
(') My mother
She was showing a place
It was in Bel-Air, so she thought it was okay to go alone, even though there was a man at the time who had raped some women that way
He was there
Who was there
51
The man
He raped her
When she didn't come back,  went to the house and found her
Mick
Stirs
Like he's seeing a possibility
(') That's when she stopped showing property
do the selling now
And started carrying a knife
Always
Mick turns it over
Finally
That's quite a story, Louis
() Your mother will have to testify
We don't want that
() don't give a damn what you think we want
From now on you do what tell you while  try this case
Do make myself clear
Louis is silent
Mick looks off
Towards Hayley, in the car
: ' ,   - she        ARMSi fast asleep but still clutching a carton of movie popcorn
Maggie leads Mick-with-Hayley through, Hayley snuggles further in her father's arms
As they continue
If she wasn't so darn heavy 'd carry her all night,  swear
Defense lawyers will swear to anything
52
,  - He's at the door about to go
Maggie delays him with, You look like you're in a daze
It turned into a rough week
Being with Hayley was the only high
She can't find anything to say
As he heads out again
Nobody's seen you at Four Green Fields lately
stopped going
Too much of a scene
Yeah well
If you start going again
Now she has his attention
If  start again, what
She's awkward
Smiles, shrugs to cover-- Bunch of us from the office are there
Tuesdays, after work
An invitation
-zrprising him
'll keep it in mind
Okay
Okay
After more awkwardness, goes
She closes the door
, 53
'  ' (' ) -  - Noisy, drinking  of legal types-- We're  through it-- Don't realize it at first but it's-- ' -- he's trying to shoulder his way through towards-- from Maggie's office-- Maggie sees him, lights up a little-- Haller
Let him in, girls
Buy you a beer
You won't make it to the bar
Then let's share this
They fight to a table for two, edge of the crowd
When he balks at sipping from her glass-- (') We've had a taste of each other before
He laughs a little, reads that she's had a few
He drinks
(') Feeling a little better tonight
Or did Ted Minton sandbag you
(How'd she know
) Yeah, that's exactly what-- With that guy Corliss, right told them using that dirtbag was a bullshit play
But you'll take the the guy's head off on the stand
Mick's off-guard, doesn't know what she's talking about
(') (catches herself, giggles) Whoops,  shouldn't say that
(to keep it alive) So Ted talked to you about Corliss
54
Huh
It was me who sent him to Ted
Corliss thought it was my case because  handled first appearance
(sees Mick is too eager) 'm telling you too much
Nah, nothing  don't know, they always use a professional snitch
(when she doesn't bite) mean Corliss has done this before, right
(clams up, with:) Can't we just forget work and have a friendly Guiness
How about we go somewhere to eat
(before she objects) So we can talk about our daughter
() Let me tell my friends 'm leaving
She goes
And Mick, quick, writes the name  on napkin
-  -   : 'll bet you didn't know Sponge-Bob movies could be so much fun
The fun's watching her
Maggie likes this
Touch glasses
After a quiet moment
You didn't know Minton had Corliss til  blabbed, did you
He was hiding something,  thought it might be a jailhouse snitch
55
You got me drunk to find out what you wanted to know
Except  was already drunk
Good point, right
He feels something
, her hand on his knee
(') Hayley's probably asleep
gotta go relieve the sitter-- (makes a face) Only  don't think  can drive myself home
one good turn
'll drive you
And will you take me back to get my car in the morning
loaded proposition
Covers her hand with his own
, '  -   - , sleeping between her two parents
Mick opens his eyes: Maggie's awake and staring at him
Grim
This is not fair to her
( --) Waking up and finding you here
She'll get her hopes up
How'd she get in here
She comes in here when she has nightmares
She has nightmares
So she sleeps in here a lot
Don't start
You have no idea what it's like raising a child alone
He can tell by her tone: All last night's tenderness gone
56
- He's dressing-- she enters to him in a robe-- Look-- 'll leave-- then come back in an hour
We'll go together to get your car then  can take her to -- Just like that
You're gonna start taking her to school
Don't you remember what we talked about last night
thought you were just trying to get into my head on your case-- or get me into bed-- (getting angry now) can't win with you-- Not when you're being a defense lawyer
Do you know how crazy we were to think we could ever make it
Me trying to get dirtbags off the street, you keeping them there-- -- Just go
(') -  -    : Unshaven
Edward Hopper drabness
To lose himself in work, looks down at his files: An 8x10   '
, 50s, pours coffee
Recoils as she glimpses the picture, the gruesome wounds, Mick didn't mean her to see
57
Sorry
It's work
just hope you catch the bastard who did it to her
And goes
Mick tucks the picture under some papers, to hide it-- but finds that he's only hid it halfway
Leaving half her face exposed
The good half
Something about this
He picks it up again, folds it
'  - Leaning over the sink, Mick holds the folded photo against the mirror, the unhurt left side showing
Creates a full image of a face
He stares a long time
Then, to himself: Martha Renteria
-   - Mick, enters
along a wall
Mick's "fleet
" California plates:   1,   3, 4
Walks past
to some battered file cabinets
He turns on a single-bulb lamp
Mick's fingers fly through the tabs of old files, stops at:
Cut to,    ,  : Mick examines them: Police reports, printouts
Until he finds
Autopsy report

Not wanting to face the memory: a  in his head: ' wish you'd called me before you talked to the cops, Jesus
58
,
, /  - , who's stalking around, in a panic, while Mick is laying out the bad news
( ) seen my picture every place
They was gonna bring me in, so
But you told Kurlen you were in her apartment
He didn't have that, he doesn't even have any prints
That shit  tol' is true, man seen her at the Cobra Room, she said if  paid we could go to her place, she didn't care about the other guy
Nobody saw any "other guy"
There was another guy, bpi guy that she was talking to
Plus the coroner says her vagina was brutalized
Are you my lawyer or what, man
(insists, crazy now) When  left that chick was fine fucked her but  didn't hurt her-- You ain't even listenin'-- Three people saw you throwing a knife into the
River
'Cause  had that knife in my car
knew they was gonna find it
If all you did was fuck her then why didn't you leave any prints
The place was wiped down
() 59
(') But your semen was on the towel, you forgot you wiped your penis on that towel
didn't forget nothing
jus' used that towel, then  give the chick the money and  left
It's not gonna make
Don't say that
Jesus they want the death penalty
can see to it that never happens, but not if you don't plead
You want me to say  did this
Mick hesitates but stays level
Unbending
No choice
Jesus, there's a deal to be made can do that
can get you Life
(Martinez crumples
) Life means you'll do fifteen
'm innocent
Inocente
You know what that means
Mick just looks at him

Beside him, his briefcase : the prison-fortress of

Martinez glares at him, then spits on the floor

need to ask some questions
you didn't have no questions then
Never ask, Did you kill that girl

Martinez is silent
Cold

You can't give him anything
But if you won't let him close to the glass, how can he see them
That's not my problem
All right, but can you stay a minute
If he IDs one of these mug- shots  need you to witness it
Don't drag me into your bullshit
And goes

Mick holds up one after another
Martinez shakes his head no-- Then the booking photo of Louis Roulet

Mick holds it up

Leaves Mick alone while he puts out the dog-- Mick cools his heels
Takes in: Cubs pennant, Raul's old peaked policeman's cap, mounted

Notes the photo of a  , its frame hung with the "Fight Aids" ribbon
Raul re-enters

It's okay

But  know who his partner was, when he was in homicide
Kurlen
That prick
'll make him sorry
Don't bother
We've got bigger problems
The way Mick says it
Raul sits, asks-- 63
Like what
Where were you today anyway
You were hard to reach
Cell phones don't work too well where  was
Raul waits
Knows this is why Mick came here
(') came to tell you a story
About Jesus Martinez
You were at San Quentin
It's about what happened after he left Martha Renteria's apartment
After he killed her
He never killed her
He went there, had sex, flushed the condom-- Wiped his prick on the pink towel-- And then went home
The story starts after he left
( ) The real killer
The real killer
She lets him in
,
'   - Maybe he fakes like it's still Martinez and he forgot something
Or maybe it was an appointment
We see the door open but we don't see who enters
64
(
) The other guy from the club
The one Jesus said he bid against
(
0
) Right
He comes in, punches her a few times to soften her up
Renteria staggers as she's suddenly pummeled, then spun
(
0
) (cont'd) Then takes out a knife and holds it to her neck while he walks her to the bedroom
We  the knife-tip against her throat
(
0
) (cont'd) Only she isn't lucky like Reggie Campo will be
He climbs on top, puts on a condom, rapes her
, , as Mick gives us the action
(
0
) (cont'd) And when he's done he stabs her over and over, fifty-two times, while he works out something in his sick fucking mind
We , the stabbing, bleeding, then-- ,
' Do you need to ask what kind of knife it was, based on the wounds
short-blade folding knife
Or whose face Martinez picked out of the mug-shots  brought him
No
No need
beat
Raul's dog barks from outside
(') Of course the story goes on from there
From there it's about the lawyer Martinez gets himself
65
Don't do this to yourself
(ignores, on a roll now) The lawyer who just assumes he did it because of the
The lawyer who gets him the best deal he can, and feels pretty good, because the deal keeps his client off Death Row
and this guy, this lawyer, he's all about the deal, see
Mick-- You can't beat yourself up for what you didn't know-- just saw him and he's twenty-six going on forty
He's a little guy
You know what happens to the little ones up there
beat
Mick drinks
(') () He has a type
Roulet
It's more than a type, Renteria and Campo, you put their faces together you get the same face
(off the drink Mick takes) You better take it easy
Listen,  was thinking about this the whole way down on the plane-- That night with Renteria
It was like he hit the jackpot-- got to do his thing and get away with it
Then he's in a bar, sees Reggie-- Who he's seen before, remember-- Yeah but tonight he sees who she looks like
66
Renteria
Right
And he's right back there
(--) Mick, we're talking about a really -- We're talking about a killer at work
You know that video from the bar
Just like you, he saw that Mr
was left-handed
(struck by this) Smart as the devil-- He knows what he's doing
Reggie's the luckiest woman alive
You think there are others
With that face, or-- You find out
Dig into Roulet
(recalls
) "All you'll find is parking tickets,"  don't buy that anymore
Check out knife-murders of women
Not just the unsolved ones, Martha Renteria was a closed case
Look man,  can't throw a net like that
'm just one guy
You gotta bring the cops in
can't
He's my client
(clear on this:) That's why he hired me
Raul looks up, startled by this
Mick lays it out
67
(') was thinking about that on the plane too: He was worried  might hear about the case and put it together
But if he was my client, 'd be bound to keep my mouth shut and protect him
() Attorney-client privilege
told you: He knows what he's doing
You got one guy in prison for what your other client did
What are you going to do, Mick
beat
'm working on it
,
'  -  - Lincoln in front
Mick, working on Raul's question
Trudges up the steps
before he gets in, he fumbles keys-- -
This is Haller
' Did you get my messages
Maggie, no,  was up in San Francisco for the day
' No you weren't
You don't go to San Francisco, you go to San Quentin
Must have been seeing a client
You always were too smart for me
Is Hayley okay
68
' She's good
Look, she's playing soccer tomorrow, and she wants you to come to the match
You've started something, Mickey
Fine,  look forward to it
' You'll need to pick her up at noon
But, under this, he sees,   , light from a room
Sudden chill
Angling to see, keeping a normal voice
Noon, 'll do that
See you then
And hangs up before she can say goodbye
And Stops
Freezes
Eyes on the  at the end of the hall
Carefully, Mick begins to move down the hall
Pauses at the door he comes to first, bedroom, dark
Kicks it-- Nothing
starts walking again, when: there's a Then silence
What was it
Mick continues-- to-- The  :  , we see it's the den-- Mick braces-- And   : -
Sitting in Mick's chair, leg up on the desk
What the hell are you doing here
Funny thing is 've been here before
was offered the house to show, never gave back the key-- (over,doesn't give a shit) Get out of my house
Now
(rising, but) -- But, sees Mick noticing-- the   on his leg-- 69
(') Your friend Valenzuela put this on
tracer
As if  were going anywhere
said Get up
Get up and get out of this house
Off Mick's force, Mick's almost crazy-- Louis smirks, goes-- ,  -  ,
(turns to him, to "") couldn't reach you
'm on trial for my life, Mick, and  get nervous when  can't reach yout And you were away all day
Like you told "Maggie
" Meaning he listened to the call
Mick goes white
You don't come near this house again, do you understand me
We aren't friends, we aren't partners, you're my client, eriod-- Just what  wanted to remind you of
'm your client
Mick reacts
Louis lets in sink in, then: (') Besides,  like it in your house, Mick
Pretty pictures of your kid, Hayley
Fucken don't
Don't what, don't say she's pretty
But  saw her, the other day at the club
At which, Mick's had enough: belts Louis in the mouth
Quick, solid
70
His lip bloodied, Louis flashes with anger-- but then, just as suddenly, he steels himself
Glares coldly at Mick
(') Okay
Okay 'm going
But-- And extends his hand: with Mick's house-key in it
(') --first  think  should give you back your key
It isn't right that have it
Now that we can trust each other
Mick takes the key
Panting, he watches Louis go down the fucking steps
,,
: Hayley, defending, scrambles to get in the way of another girl, a forward, dribbling towards her
, on the sideline
among other parents
That's it, Hayley, get in her way
Hayley isn't quick enough, the forward dribbles round her, goes in for the score
Hayley looks despondently at Mick-- (') It's okay, honey
When-- his -
Into it-- (') This is Haller
He strains to listen
Stops cold
His look darkens
Even from the field, Hayley sees this
,
'  - ,  , as he
It's a , swarms with cops, forensics, technicians
Mick distressed, moves as if through heavy water are leading him: , 38, clean-marine-- and , 30
They wear paper booties, thin rubber gloves
71
Levin was back in his office
We wouldn't have found him if a neighbor hadn't brought the dog back
It was running loose
(shows a desk calendar) Your name's all over this
Were you the only guy he worked for
No, but 've got a big trial next month, attempted rape and murder
He was helping me
Is that the Roulet case
How did you know
Because every file that's been rifled has the name
Only thing, Roulet himself is already cleared for this
We've checked the tracking on his tracer- anklet and it doesn't show him anywhere near this place
And there's no way to trick those things, no way in the world
We see Mick register this-- wants to ask about it, but before -- (') By the way, Counsellor, where were you this morning
Mick rocked by the question
What it means
'm a suspect
He knew whoever shot him
There are no signs of forcible, he even let the killer into the back room
72
was watching my daughter play soccer
couple of dozen people can confirm  was there
Provisionally buying this, Lankford takes out booties
Put these on and don't touch anything back there
'  - Raul face down on the floor, in front of his desk chair
Can you tell us if you see anything unusual
Mick draws close
Lankford, abruptly-- All  see are pictures of a guy
Was he a fruit
() He was a hell of an ex-cop, is what he was
Crimes Against Persons, back in Chicago
And yeah he was gay, and what the hell's that got to do with it
If the murder was some kind of gay thing, why'd they ransack the office
Isn't it obvious they were looking for something to do with his work
Lankford can't argue with this
When Sobel, near the body: Look
The position of his hands
: Two middle fingers point down
Two outside fingers up
Was this guy a Longhorns fan or what
Or is it some kind of sign, like he was trying to tell us who -- ( "") --"The devil did it
" 73
:   () - Seen from the  -- () -     - He drives the street, his focus pumped up
until he comes to:  , its garage door wide open
Mick pulls into the drive behind it
-   - What he  inside, beside a family van, is a It's upright, marked "Fragile
" -   - Mick stands there  at the door
It's opened by: Hey Mick
Val's surprised
a mix of emotions
(') What're you doin' here
and heard about Raul Levin, man
(ignores all that) You know your garage door's open
Shit:  just had a plasma delivered
And rushes to
the
Mick trails
Val's relieved to find the box is okay
(') Oh man, if we still lived in Van Nuys this sucker'd be gone
Set me back eight grand, too
But it's gonna be great for the games
(notes Mick's silent mood) What's up anyway
What brings you out here
74
Raul's murder
(Val waits, listens
) 've been with the cops
They can't tie Roulet to it, because your ankle bracelet doesn't put him near the house
know,  gave them the trace
The bracelet's got a mass detector, there's no way to beat that
Did the cops ask you where you were this morning, Val
Val's slow at first, to register just what Mick's asking
(') Somehow, some way, Louis killed Raul Levin
And it didn't show up on the trace
Mick looks at the plasma , then back at Val
Val reddens-- You better not be sayin' what think-- that  cut him loose-- to let him kill Raul--
Maybe you didn't know what he was going to do-- (over, angry--) You think 'd let that happen
For a fuckin'
And he lunges at Mick, shoves him back agains the van, Mick shoves back, harder, backwards into the  box-- it hits the cement floor, hard, and Val falls on top of it-- Sickening snap/crunch from within the box-- (') Shit, man-- Where'd you get the money for an eight thousand dollar , Val
75
That's bullshit
didn't do that
How dare you say that to me-- 'm inocente, man-- Mick reacts to the word-- Martinez's word-- as Val glares at him from the ground
(') Get outa here; Get out of here, Mick, and get outa my life
Mick's already backing off-- towards the car-- (') Keep going, man
Mick keeps going-- down the drive and into his car--  , -  -
Drinking,  moves on him, he taps the glass for another
Bartender comes over like he's going to pour one
Mick's keys are on the bar-- Instead of pouring the bartender swipes the keys
Mick looks at him, uncomprehending
That's it
You're done here, pal
And you're not driving either
(shows keys, keeps them) Call yourself a cab or something
Off Mick, '  -  - , lugs him into his room, he's a mess
Being married to you sucked but it beat being a car service
That's the idea, y'know
Car service, with the Lincolns-- Drive the illustrious turds of our city back and forth to -- 76
'll be your first customer
First dollar
And rolls him onto the bed
He looks at her
Drunk as he is: Lemme ask you something
Corliss
The name Corliss
You didn't just give me that just because you'd been drinking
You wanted me to have it
She doesn't confirm or deny
Just gets him into bed-- says -- 'm not staying
He knows, but-- one thing more-- Maggie-- Raul
Did  get him killed
Moved, she shakes her head no
Straightens his pillow
How do you do it, Haller
You're a sleazy defense lawyer with two ex- wives and a daughter, and we all still love you
We    as she stands up, goes
To no one: can't do this anymore
'  -  - He's in bad shape as he comes out of the bedroom
Stares at the light pouring in from the glass doors onto the porch
Finds: '
(From Maggie
) Also: the      is
: He's pressed the button, listens to
Message received: , - 77
' Mick, it's me
Guess  missed you
Wanted to go over a few things, so wouldn't interrupt your day with Hayley
Anyway
Presses
Raul's voice: Mick's not sure he can deal
But pulls the pencil & pad near him, and presses  again
'  (cont'd) First, that witness name you gave me
Corliss
Turns out he's this hype, Dwayne Jeffrey Corliss, sometimes goes by "
" When you run it that way you find out he's played the courtroom snitch a lot, mostly in Arizona
But here's the thing: One time down there
It blew up on him
'm working on it, it can be good for us
Don't know how we get to him, though
They put him in  lock-up, just to make it harder
Under which Mick, excited, is writing down
then , circles this last
'  (cont'd) Other thing is, you asked me to dig deep-on Roulet
Mick,  found something
found Martinez' ticket out of the
When, on the tape he hears
and a
'  (cont'd) Uh, that's somebody at the door
Look, have a good time with your kid
Gotta go, boss
And  goes
Mick thinks a moment
Tries to clear his head
Then pulls out a card and dials a number
/
, : () Detective Sobel
( ) It's me
Haller
() 78
(') Look, -- just checked my phone messages
It turns out Raul called me
Just before he was killed didn't know
( ) The message came at Eleven-oh- seven
He said, " think  found Martinez' ticket out of the
" () Meaning Jesus Martinez-- that's a former client of yours-- In San Quentin
Right
Did he say anything else
Looks down at his notes
At "Corliss
" "
"  beat
As he tears off the note, stuffs it in his pocket
No-- No, that's it
Then the dog barked, somebody was at the door
He hung up
(before she can ask more) Look, maybe you can tell me if there's any progress on the case
(when she hesitates) He was my friend
Sobel, makes a decision
Well, we did catch a break
We found a bullet casing in the room, from a 22
It turns out Levin owned a
22, but when we checked it out it wasn't a Woodsman, like the gun that killed him
To which, Mick reacts
as she goes on
(') The other thing is we can't find his cell-phone
(noticing Mick is silent) Are you still there
79
Yeah
just, 'll let you know if think of anything
About his cell- phone,  mean
Thanks
And hangs up
Too sudden
Leaves Sobel wondering
,
Down the hall, to a closet, climbs clumsily above to a shelf-- Tossing clothes out of the way
Finds: The top has a brass plate:  "
" Mick, in a cold sweat, opens the box
It's
Suddenly-- -
For air-- He can hardly breathe-- straightens his thoughts-- Takes the note from his pocket, studies it
- - -
leads him
leads him to a room and leaves him there
With
In prison jumper
Faint smile
Gloria 'm not here about you
'm here about me
need your help
:      -
- Louis, lanky, graceful, takes a seat at the
Mick, sorts papers
Louis, turns, seems to watch him
,  :  and  , she's on edge but hides-- Also , to support Mick
While,   : Mick
want to tell you something before we start
80
Better make it fast
You're my lawyer, right
So  can tell you anything, even a crime 've committed, and you have to keep it secret
(a beat, uncomfortable--) That's right
Unless it's one you're going to commit
've killed people, Mick
Reaction Mick
Just then, Courtroom clerk gives a warning-- Two minutes, people
( ) Now
Now
Why now, are you telling me this
Because  know your plan
Mick looks at him
Before he can deny-- (') Your plan is to defend me on this-- then, when 'm not your client, throw me to the cops
(when Mick says nothing) can't let that happen
So 'm telling you: 've killed people and guess what
Martha Renteria was one of them
There now
If you use what 've told you you might get Jesus Martinez out of jail, but you'll never practice law again
And 'll never be prosecuted
think it's called fruits of the poisoned tree-- Come with me
Cuts Louis off, rises, leads him
past prosecution table, turns, watches them
as Mick leads Louis out to-- 81
,   - He suddenly spins on Louis and puts him against a wall
You son of a bitch
You killed Raul
You're right about one thing
am a son of a bitch
How did you do it
The trace said you weren't even in Glendale
He was getting too close
(yanks Louis's lapels) You piece of shit, do you think you have this wired
You don't
do have an insurance policy
He grabs Mick's wrists
Strong: pulls them off his chest
want my gun, Louis-- walk away from this trial a free man-- and remain free-- and it never falls into wrong hands
The deal
Mick's close to hitting him-- when the door opens-- Judge Fullbright is on the bench
-   -
Nice of you to join us
She's 46, bad hair, tough
Mick's off on the wrong foot
'm sorry, your honor

What this case is about is a predator
On the night of March Sixth, Louis Roulet was out stalking his prey
Jury of twelve, two alternates
(') You are going to hear from the victim herself about her lifestyle, one that we would not condone
But remember that anyone, anyone, can be the victim of a violent crime
(approaches the jury box) The case is clear
Straightforward
man attacked a woman in her home in order to rape and kill her
It is only by the grace of God that she's here to tell you the story
Over Ted, (
) Ladies and gentlemen of the jury
(') My name's Michael Haller, and 'm representing Louis Roulet
(glances at Ted) Mr
Minton doesn't want to use the word prostitute for the woman who's supposed to be Louis's victim
He needn't worry, this case isn't about how she makes her money
But it is about her actions
How she saw a young man with signs of wealth, and chose to target him
(closes in on the jury
) What she didn't count on, was you
The fact that you'd put two and two together, and let your common sense tell you who was the real predator
83
,
- As Mick exits with Lorna for the lunch-break
Low-voiced-- You had a message from Gloria
She thinks she can do what you asked
Thinks
Corliss has the same meal time
She can try
() Let her try
But it may not matter
What do you mean
mean, Corliss isn't on the witness list
It could be Ted Minton is holding him back
He won't use him until he has to
Until  screw up his case so bad he has no choice
Mickey
Can you do that
Off Mick, tries for a confident smile
,
,  -   : () 'd describe Ms
Campo when we got there as
hurt and frightened
Frightened
She kept asking us if she was safe, even after Roulet was taken away
84
, Mick has Maxwell on cross
Clerk hands her pages
Officer, would you read from your arrest report where it's marked
"The victim does not know the man who assaulted her or why she was attacked
" Why did you write that she didn't know him
Because that's what she said
So, she just opened the door at ten o'clock to a stranger
She didn't put it like that
Was there blood on his right hand
(confused by the shift) No, his left
Or we would have bagged his right one, too
As a new witness is on the stand, Ted's witness
Mr
Talbot, you were with Miss Campo on the night of March Sixth
, 48, the customer from the video
Blurred tattoos on muscled forearms, dyed blonde hair
Yep
Had a date with her at Morgan's
Then from there we went to her place and had another date, if you know what  mean
B5
Air of a sleaze-ball sex-player, but calm and good-humored
Had you known Miss Campo before
Nope
Just called her up
How did you know to call her
From her website
She's got a real good website
Jury laughs a little
Fascinated but repulsed by this guy
but Fullbright stirs, disliking Talbot's tone
Did you have sexual relations
Four hundred bucks worth
And she earned every cent
Angle a male , red-faced with disapproval
Mick catches his reaction, likes it
Ted goes on
And what time did you leave
About five minutes before ten
She say she had another engagement
No, she acted like she was done for the night
Objection,  don't think Mr
Talbot's qualified to interpret Ms
Campo's thinking or plans
just mean she acted satisfied
(--) Sustained
Go on, Mr
Minton
86
When you left, what condition was she in
Was she hurt
No, she was fit as a fiddle
know because 'd just played her
(before Fullbright bursts) Sorry, your honor
She was fine
Minton goes, lifts a sheet over an easel,  the blown- up  of the Reggie's battered face
She didn't look like this
Man
What kind of bastard does something like that
Answer the question
No
We made consensual and pleasurable love
Which is what life is all about
Then  paid her
,
Mr
Talbot, are you right or left- handed
Left
Left
And isn't it true that before you left Regina Campo asked you to strike her repeatedly in the face
() Your honor, there's no basis for this sort of questioning
Mr
Haller is just muddying the waters with outrageous statements
Fullbright looks to Mick for a reply
Mick half-shrugs
87
Part of the defense theory, Judge
The witness can answer
never hit her or any other woman
Do you know a prostitute named
(checks his sheet) Shaquille Barton
"Shaquilla Shakels" is her work name
Okay, yeah
seen her one time
And if  brought her here and she said you had struck her with your left hand
She'd be lying
tried Shaquilla, that rough stuff's not for me
'm a missionary man
With a strong left
Thank you
And Mick sits-- drawing a nasty look from Ted for this last, and a pleased one from Louis
, -  - Where Mick, as he exits the courtroom for the day, is : Sobel holds documents
Reaction Mick: Oh shit
,
, '  () - Mick looks over the pages Sobel hands him
Lankford drives
This warrant is bullshit-- Good enough to search your house
For a Woodsman registered to you
We need to run ballistics on it
She turns around: The good cop, but she's hurt: (') It would have been better if you'd told me that you had a Woodsman
don't anymore
It was stolen
The worst yet
Lankford laughs: "How convenient
" '  -  - : The    : Sobel in gloves, examines, while-- We got the history on the piece
Turns out it belonged to Mickey Cohen the gangster, in the forties
know
My father represented him
He got him off for using it in self- defense, so Cohen made him a present of it
Sobel, careful, opens it
It's empty
Like Mick said
Why didn't you report it stolen
Because  knew who took it
(They look at him
) client
He told me, so  couldn't turn him in without breaking a trust
They do that
(doesn't buy this) Still and all, mind if  look around
Just in case you haven't had time to toss it off a pier
Go crazy
You've got the warrant
Lankford sneers, starts for the next room
To Sobel-- 89
Heidi-- bag the box
He leaves
As she bags it-- He wonders why
You can't do ballistics on a box
She glances, seeing Lankford's gone-- explains
That old Mickey Cohen shooting
It's kind of famous
It turns out the county still has the evidence in storage
The bullet
You can match casings to a slug that's fifty years old
It'd be easier with the gun, but yeah
She goes to join her partner
Mick stops her with-- Detective
How long will ballistics take
Careful
You'll make me think you're worried what we'll find
'm in the middle of a trial
day
Maybe forty-eight hours
She leaves
Mick's gaze, in the mirror: Fear
-   -
Mick and Ted, at the same time
As they move to the front
Morning, Haller
Word is, you had interesting visitors last night
90
Worry about yourself, Ted
You're dying the death of a thousand razors up there and you don't even know it
They peel off-- Mick to the defense table, where Louis waits for him
Before Louis can speak: Low-- (') Listen, you little shit: This gun- scheme of yours is about to blow up, and 'm not going down for it
If  have to drive people to the airport the rest of my life
Mick is seething
Louis smiles
Unruffled
,  -
One last witness, your honor
The prosecution calls Regina Campo
,  -
Diminutive, conservative dress, dark curls around her pretty face-- none of the aggressive sexiness
Hesitant but frank
It's true that  lied
knew him when he came to the door
In fact, you'd arranged his coming Miss Campo: why did you lie
was scared
wasn't sure the police would believe me and wanted to make sure they arrested him
because he's an animal
She looks tentatively at Louis, as if still scared-- then she looks away
Louis is blank
Mick takes it in
Ted follows up-- Do you regret that decision now
91
Yes
If it helps him to get free and do this to somebody else
Your honor, prejudicial-- Sustained
But   : the damage is done
Reggie's moved them
have no further questions for Regina, your honor
Ted sits
Your witness, Mr
Haller
Mick about to rise when-- Louis grabs his hand
Low-voiced---- want to remind you of your words
You were going to tear her apart and throw her entrails into the sea
That's it, keep acting like you pull the strings
do
Mr
Haller
Emphatic
Mick frees his hand, straightens himself
watched by Louis
Then all at once, to surprise her-- Ms
Campo have you engaged an attorney to sue Mr
Roulet for the events of March Sixth
(recovers, No  haven't
But have you talked to an attorney
92
haven't hired anybody or-- asked if you talked to one
About a possible lawsuit
Mick's crisp like he knows for sure
She wilts a little
It was nothing more than talk
Did you ask if you could sue Mr
Roulet for damages
thought what you say to lawyers is private
If you wish, you can tell the jurors
Faces her
Ted squirms, seeing the box she's in
think  want to keep it private
Ted squirms again
Wrong answer
Okay, let's go back to the night at Morgan's
Had you ever seen Louis Roulet before that night
Yes
There and other places
Ever noticed he wore a Rolex watch
-- Or that he drove one of two cars, a Porsche or a Range Rover
never saw him driving
93
And what made you approach him
knew he was in the life
You know
player
had seen him leave with girls who do what  do
With prostitutes
To go to a hotel, or their apartments
don't know where
So how do you know they left
Maybe they just went out for a smoke
Because they got in his car and drove away
But you just testified that you never saw Mr
Roulet drive
Now you saw him leave with a prostitute like yourself
Which is it
The contradiction rings round the room
Reggie, tries
saw him get in a car but  didn't know what kind it was
Do you know the difference between a Porsche and a Range Rover
one's big and one's small,  guess
Reactions
Reggie shakes her head, knows she's not making it
But Mick, like he's just getting started
The women he left with, when you saw them again, had they been beaten or injured
don't know,  didn't ask
94
But girls in your profession talk about customers, don't you
Warn each other if someone's a freak
Yeah, usually
And how many had warned you about Louis Roulet
None
No one
So you believed you'd be safe
, thought he was a known quantity and  needed the money, so
So you thought he could solve your need for money
-- No
Isn't that why we're sitting here
Because you zeroed in on him
No
mean yes, but not like that-- (looking round, a plea to ) He attacked me,  swear

It goes

What did the napkin say, Ms
Campo
My name and address
And your price
Yes
Four hundred dollars
(after a beat) It's a hard line of work
And dangerous
In fact, haven't you told friends you were looking for a way out
Yes
'm not proud of what  do-- And so, isn't it true-- nothing would be easier to understand-- that you saw Louis Roulet and his money as a way out
No
That's not what this is about
That man hit me and tried to kill me
Yes, we've heard you say that-- ( ) Judge may  ask the witness to stand up
(surprised, but) The witness will stand
hope you're going somewhere with this, Mr
Haller
Reggie stands
96
Now if you please, walk over to my client
She goes, stands before Louis
Who rises on cue from Mick
(') This is the man you broke free from, overpowered, knocked out
Yes-- You can do amazing things when you're afraid-- How much do you weigh, Ms
Campo
Because your website --- - says one hundred three
That's right
beat
Louis sits
Reggie stands there
suddenly cries
've got no further questions for the witness, your honor
Reggie returns to a seat behind the prosecutor's table
Where we pick up
Staring at Mick, hiding the sense of damage as best he can
He's startled when: Mr
Minton
Do you have another witness for us
Ted rouses, summons confidence, rises
, , Louis to Mick, re Ted
He looks worried
Mick watching Ted, waits, tense
The state rests, your honor
Mick's disappointed: No Corliss
Not worried enough
97
(raises a gavel
) Then the defense will call its first witness after lunch
And the gavel comes down
,    - ,  ,
Yes,  recognize this knife
(holding an evidence bag) It's the one my son carried with him for protection for the last four years
Almost exactly
Why would he need protection
Because realtors alone in a house are sometimes robbed or hurt
Even raped or murdered
But has Louis ever been the subject of such a crime
No
But he knew someone who
(hesitates
) Go on, please
She was raped and robbed by a man
Louis found her
It was terrible
The first thing he did afterwards was get himself a knife to carry, at all times
(looks at Ted Minton) March Sixth would have been no different
98
,  -
Mrs
Windsor, you seemed pretty exact, about when your son started carrying around this, this weapon, a five-inch folding knife
am
The incident took place on June ninth, two-thousand-one
Mick watches Ted, carefully
Cat and mouse
Was it in the newspapers
No
Or, do you somehow remember because the police came to talk to Louis
There was no police investigation
Then how can you remember the exact date so well
(sly look at Mick) Were you given the date before testifying here
know the date because 'll never forget the day  was attacked
The news falls on Ted
She goes on before he can rally
(cont'd) Louis will never forget it either
He found me in that house, tied up
Naked
It was traumatic for him
She's perfect: a strong woman, unused to showing emotion
Mick smiles, impressed
When, with some sarcasm: Mr
Minton-- anything else
Ted, still thrown, stares down at his notes
99
As Louis's mother, you'd do or say anything to save him, wouldn't you
wouldn't lie
Not about what happened that day
We have no police or hospital record that it even occurred
never reported it
Why not
was ashamed
If you don't understand that  can't explain it to you
And yet  live with it every day
But it's only you who says so: Mary looks at Ted, and at the Judge, as if confused: Is that a question
Off Mick, admiring,  , - -,
Mick packing his stuff-- looks up, as Ted approaches
've been thinking about the thousand razors
- Louis waits on the steps, Mick comes out
Where they're alone
We've had an offer
Want to spend six months in county jail
100
told you from the beginning-- know: The only verdict's Not Guilty
Okay
We'll get there
Grateful for this, Louis puts a hand on Mick's arm
But: (') Don't touch me, Louis
You want to show your gratitude give me my gun back
Louis grins: meaning No way
(') thought so
() You still sure you want me to put you on the stand
insist on it
Then get some rest tonight, you're up next
Leaving Louis, Mick continues down the steps, to where the Lincoln waits
He gets in
- Earl in the front seat
There's something  need you to get me, Earl
tone Earl never heard him use before
Earl turns around
,
-   -
Mick steps past Ted on his way to his desk
As he passes-- Did you talk to your client
Yes
No deal
101
Ted feigns surprise-but-acceptance
While,   : (') The defense calls Louis Ross Roulet, your honor
,  -
turned toward the living room, the way she pointed
, has a floorplan of the apartment, on an easel
And what happened when you turned
Something hit me and  blacked out
don't know for how long
That was all
Then when  woke up these guys were on me, telling me not to move couldn't anyway
was too scared
Mick moves toward Louis, as if determined to find flaws
But, there was blood on your jacket and your left hand
Someone put it there because didn't
Are you left-handed
No
You didn't strike Ms
Campo with your left fist
No
102
Threaten to rape her, or kill her
-- No
You're angry
Why
(passionate but simple--) Do you know what it's like to be accused of something like this
To listen to people tell lies about your having done something so sick and awful
,  understand  had to be quiet and wait my chance and not say anything-- but if guilty people have rights, what about innocent people
am innocent
Mick
Meets Louis's eye, communicates: You were perfect
Nothing further, Judge
Ted already up & moving, passes Mick as he takes his seat-- According to you, Ms
Campo punched herself or had a man she never met before punch her lights out as part of a set-up
All  know is that  didn't
And this knife you always carry, how did she know she'd find it on you as part of the set-up
("") She couldn't, could she
mean, never took it out or showed it to anybody-- so she must have just found it when she went into my pocket for the money  had that was going to pay her with, right
-- 'd really prefer it if  ask the questions, and you answer them
(then calming himself) Would you look at this, please-- Goes to the easel, :  of Reggie's beaten face
(') Please tell us again if you think Regina Campo would or could have done this to herself
don't know who did it, but it wasn't me
Nobody deserves that to happen
(seizes on this) What do you mean by "deserves
" Do you mean crimes of violence come down to a whether a woman gets what she "deserves
" (right back at him) mean no matter what she does for a living or who she is-- No woman deserves that
Ted keeps staring at the photo: Wants the jury looking there
have no more questions
At which, suddenly there's a wave of movement-- --- Louis dismissed from the chair-- Ted returning to his seat, passing Mick as Mick rises-- Louis gives Mick a "How'd  do
" look, Mick nods, unmistakably, "You did fine
"-- Mick's look finds Ted-- Mick and Ted holding each other in a gaze-- Mick's face in a kind of smile, Ted grim-- As Mick brings out, speaking to the Judge but his smiling eyes fixed on the unhappy Ted--    for Mick's confident, fateful words: Your honor, the defense rests
104
Ted hears this, sets his jaw
Fullbright turns to him
Mr
Minton
Ted is uncertain
Your honor
(She waits
) The state needs the night to decide, your honor
To decide what
Frankly  wasn't anticipating the defense would rest after two witnesses
-- 'd like the night to consider calling a rebuttal witness
(reacts, "objects--") Your honor, first we've heard of -- said `-consider
"  need to find out if the witness is even -- The state still has an obligation to disclose the identity-- Not if  decide not to use him
(a note of pleading) 'm begging the court's indulgence, your honor
Fulbright doesn't like it
but weighs, yields
Go to, :
, ,
It's the vast view from Mick's porch
He has a drink in his hand
And holds a phone to his ear
' There's a rumor in the office
105
How 'm the one who shot Raul
'  - In the  we  , in pajamas, jumping on her bed
Maggie closes the bedroom door so she can speak
Haller, is this serious
:    , / 'd say so
'm being set up for his murder
Couple of detectives from Glendale are following me around, just waiting for the go- ahead to hit me with an arrest warrant
Could be any minute
How is this possible
Bad timing, bad client, me being dumb
Is it Roulet
Is that the client
can't talk to you about my clients
How is Hayley
Fine
But Haller, if she ever hears anything about this-- She won't
Not if  play it right
What are you going to do
long beat
Then he says, just as he told Raul-- 'm working on it
have a plan
106
,
() -   - , in the back seat
Looking out at the rain
His look a little different: close shave, neat suit
Fade up sound of Earl, meanwhile, rattling on
when Not Guilty Two gets to four thousand miles, that's two cars ready, that's enough to start the airport runs
Scene we saw at the opening
Mick absorbed
Earl notices
(') You gettin' any of this, Mr
Haller
Mick opens the file (back-seat office extraordinarily neat)
Top of the print-out: vs
,  - Earl holds an umbrella over Mick, they hurry into the building
- The items in his briefcase checked, wand passed over him
-  -  '
As he moves down the hall
Everything counts today
Enters: - ,  - Ted prepares at his table
Look at each other without greeting-- as Mick moves to the , who shuffles papers
Bill, 'm getting coffee
Any for you
No man, 'm off caffeine
107
Hey, is that the custody list
Can see if any of my no-good clients are on it
Bill lets him have it
Mick, casual, looks over the names
-   - , she's paying for a take-out coffee, when Mick scoops her up by the arm, urgent, he's been looking for her-- Minton's putting on Corliss
He's got him in lock-up already
But Gloria still hasn't let us know if she got to him
You said she had mealtimes to work it
Yes but
'll take my chances
Meantime did you serve Kurlen
Moving her    ,   -- hushed & fast-- Yes but  didn't like forging the judge's signature
Yes you did
Yes  did
Just then, approaching, he sees  & : Are they coming for him
No, they turn into the courtroom along with others showing up for the trial's last day
Relieved-- Now go, and be ready for my call
Lorna starts to go-- then pauses
108
'm crazy about the power suit
Extra flip to her hips as she goes because Mick's watching
- No sooner enters than 's in his face, waves a document
What shit is this, Haller
got nothing to do with your case
Mick, "innocent," inspects the papers
With surprise-- Subpoena to appear as a witness
You'll just have to wait and see
It's a legal document, Detective
Cursing, Kurlen takes himself off to a corner
Leaving Mick with the "legal document
" He tucks it away-- And continues to the front-- Past   and , to , at the defense table
, -: (
0
) Mr
Minton-- ,   - '
Does the state have any rebuttal
(rises, ready) The state calls Dwayne Jeffrey Corliss as rebuttal witness
Judge
Who is this witness
Why wasn't  told before now
fair question
Mr
Minton
Dwayne Corliss is a cooperating witness who spoke with Mr
Roulet in custody, following his arrest
109
(shouts, suddenly--) Bullshit
didn't to talk to-- Quiet, Mr
Roulet
Mr
Haller, control your client
Mick bends over, to Louis, sotto voce-- That was good
Now leave it to me
(to the court) do share my client's outrage, your honor
'd at least like to know how long the state has been sitting on this testimony
Mr
Corliss did not come forward until yesterday
() This is incredible
Do you want to go back and talk to him
Given the timing 'd allow it
No, Judge, we all know what this is, this is a jailhouse snitch, and anything he'd say would be a lie-- That's groundless, your honor-- -- just want my objection noted
Then 'm going to rule he can -- Can  ask one indulgence
Can step into the hallway and make a call to an investigator
For whatever good it will do at this late date
110
- Mick already dialling-- Lorna answering-- ' Yep, here
Put your watch at quarter of
At ten fifteen you enter the room
' Got it
With the printouts
' Mickey,  know the moves
He snaps shut his cell-phone
,   - Prison jumpsuit
We recognize him: the holding-cell junky
Mr
Corliss, are you incarcerated at this time
Um, no, now 'm just in the courtroom
Dumb answer draws laughs
, seething
But you are currently held in the jail-ward at  hospital
Yes
Since  got arrested
For burglary and drug possession
That's right
Now
Do you know the defendant
Yes
met him in lock-up
We was bussed over from jail, and then we was together in the tank when we came for first appearance
And did you talk at that time
Yes
we talked about how bad we needed cigarettes
Anything else
You know, "what are you in for
" Like that
Did he say what he was "in for
" He said, "For giving a bitch exactly what she deserved
" Those were his words
Reaction Louis, stirs like a caged animal
Mick steadies
have only one more question
Have , or has anyone, made you promises to get you to testify
No
It's the right thing to do
Ted sits
Judge turns to Mick-- who's just staring, angrily
Then rises
Like he doesn't know what to do
Louis, the others, watch anxiously
Mick crosses to the front, steals a glance at the rear,   standing against the wall, seated in front of him
Then
How many times have you been arrested, Mr
Corliss
About seven in
Couple of times in Phoenix if you count those
112
So you know how the system works
try to survive
And sometimes that means ratting out fellow inmates, is that it
Objection, your honor
Take a seat, Mr
Minton
gave you leeway bringing this witness in
Thank you, your honor
But 'll rephrase: How many times have you snitched on an inmate
Testified against a fellow inmate for the prosecution
This makes my fourth
( ) Four times
People just come up and tell you they committed crimes so you can testify against them-- People talk to me
'm a friendly guy
Mick, walks toward Louis, indicates him-- So you and my client were friends-- That's right, we was friendly-- And he just said what you said he said, about what the woman "deserved," and then you went back to talking about cigarettes
113
Not exactly
He was like, bragging
He told me he did it before
Mick freezes
Like he's in a mine field and can't move
(') He said the other time he killed the bitch
He got away with it then and he would get away with it now
(staring at Corliss) You
Wait
All eyes on Mick
The Judge prompts
Mr
Haller
No more questions, your honor
Re-direct, your honor
Fullbright nods permission
While Louis leans over to Mick
What the hell is this
You tell me
What did you say to this guy
(through gritted teeth) Nothing
This is a set-up
You're doing this
How
How am  doing this
But Louis has no answer
Meanwhile Ted's taken the floor
You said he was bragging
How
Well, like, he told me the details
About the other one, that he killed
() 114
(') He called her a snake dancer
She danced in some joint where she was like in a snake pit
,   , he leans forward at this
,  at the defense table: Mick, "alarmed," low to Louis-- How does he know this
Do you think  know
If you didn't tell him this shit somebody did
Who
Start thinking
Ted, moving closer to Corliss-- Is there anything else he told you
No, that snake-girl stuff was it
(after a beat) Then no further questions, your honor
Ted sits
The look he gives Mick in passing is one of abounding confidence
Mick stews
Swivels around
Covert glance, ' , looks to see if Kurlen is where he was, against the wall
He's not
He's gone
So is Lankford
And the courtroom door still swings slightly, as if they've just left
While  : Any re-cross from the defense
Mick rises to answer, hesitates-- and just then turns to see Lorna enter and approach down the aisle
moment with my staff, Judge
Be quick
He meets Lorna at the gate
Brings his head close to hers-- 115
This is where  whisper in your ear, tell you stuff
(takes a file from her) It's all here, right
You go now, don't want anyone talking to you
Damn
She goes, he returns to the table
Before Louis can speak: don't know what's going on here, but it won't matter if it's two murders or a hundred if  can show he's a liar-- If you set me up  swear 'll-- Just tell me if there's anything else he knows
Anything else  have to stay away from
don't know because  never talked to him
'm not that stupid
It doesn't matter
If  destroy him none of it counts
(from his gut) Then destroy him
command
Mick nods
Returns to the witness Corliss-- Dwayne, if  can call you that-- It's what people call me-- Don't they also call you
For example, down in Phoenix, right
116
Maybe
He's a bit wary
Mick looks through the file Lorna brought-- Because you know, my assistant, she was just reading on the internet about
Corliss-- arrested in Phoenix, 1989 on drug charges-- Hometown of Mesa, Arizona
Yeah, that'd be me
But-- You remember Fred Bentley, right
Corliss, darkens, stumbles at this-- Ted's quick-- object, your honor, where is the defense going with this
Connect the dots soon, Mr
Haller
But the witness can answer
don't remember any Bentley-- Sure you do
You testified that he confessed to you the crime he was charged with-- rape of a ten-year- old girl-- even though he denied his guilt in court
Am
ringing any bells,
Uh-- 1989,  was high a lot, there's not much  recall-- Then 'd like you to read this to us,
It's a printout of a news story from the Arizona Star, 1997, that's eight years after he was convicted
ask that it be admitted into evidence-- Your honor
news report
117
Let's see where it takes us
The state can object later
Mick hands printout to the bailiff, who gives it to Corliss
've marked the paragraph
ain't too good at reading
(clears his throat) " man, Frederick Bentley, wrongly convicted of rape, was released Saturday after con-- () --conclusive  results cleared him of the crime
The case was bolstered at trial by testimony from an informant,
Corliss of Mesa, who claimed Bentley had-- bragged to him about the rape while together in a holding cell--" That's enough
(takes it from him) Were you charged with perjury for that incident,
No  was not
Was that because the police were complicit in your confession
(rises, angry--) Judge, how can the witness know what went into the
's decision
(ignores, over--) Were you promised the same deal here, Mr
Corliss
To say that Louis Roulet "bragged" to you in the "holding cell
" Alright, Mr
Haller, that will do
118
(Ceases
Angry
) Sorry
have no more questions
And Mick sits
Courtroom's hushed
Until-- 'm excusing the jury for an early lunch
Bailiff, see them out
Maintains a smile as the jurors leave
Then her smile dies
'  - No sooner through the door-- than Fullbright wheels on Ted: Mr
Minton do you know what you have done
You've put a documented liar on the stand, a man with a record of putting innocent people -- Your honor, -- You shut the fuck up when 'm talking to you
can think of nothing more prejudicial or corrupt than what  just saw out therel (in a rage now--) Do you realize what you've done to my trial
- As Mick and Ted exit into hall-- Ted hurrying off, angry-- Mick to , , and  -- tells them re Ted: He's going to see his boss
To decide what to do before the judge comes down with a directed verdict
What's a directed verdict
She takes it out of the jury's hand and declares an acquittal
119
(/) Oh my god
We'll know in a few minutes
And heads off
Louis's cold stare, watches him go
- ' Mick at the urinal
Louis enters in and slides behind him
'm not celebrating just yet, Mick
Yeah  can see that
want to know how Corliss got that shit he was saying
Let it go
You're getting what you want, 'm getting you off
What  want is get off for good
Leans into him
Pushes a hand into his back
threat
(') You'd better understand that
You've got enough reasons to be afraid of me already
When--  -- the courtroom , , enters
It's starting
,
-   -
just spoke to the District Attorney, your honor
The state wishes to dismiss all charges
Here's a motion
Mick, Louis, watch Ted hand it to Fullbright
120
(') It acknowledges that the procedures which guarantee justice were not followed in this case
(as she reads) This is a motion to dismiss with prejudice
No coming back
Ever
( ) Yes, your honor
,  -  -
tearful at the news, grips Mick's hand
she and Dobbs
Mr
Haller, thank you for my son
You were splendid-- And Louis
Private, a few feet away
Smiles
knew  wasn't wrong about you
want the gun
Of course you do
No more can be said, because Mrs
Windsor-- descends on Mick-- Mr
Haller, this time  insist you come to Orso for a celebration-- don't think so
Mary would insist, but before she can, comes -- with
Mick freezes, expects the worst-- but they move  him and   : Louis Roulet, you are under arrest
Turn around and place your hands behind your back
121
(as Kurlen cuffs him) Mick
This shouldn't be happening
Mrs
Windsor rushes Kurlen-- Sobel tries forcing her back-- No
Take your hands off my son
Mother
Louis' voice controls her
Stricken, Mary gives up
Then-- What are you arresting him for
(starting to take Louis) Suspicion of murder
The murder of Martha Renteria
That snake-dancer nonsense
Are you crazy
Everything that man Corliss said was a lie
Which stops Kurlen
He grins, confirmed
If it was all lies, how'd you know meant the snake dancer
Dobbs sees his mistake
Kurlen begins again to take Louis-- moment with my client, Detective
Kurlen nods, why not
Mick leads Louis a few steps away
(') This is it, Louis
got you off
Now get yourself a new lawyer
You're forgetting  have the gun
Yeah, and you'll have to explain how you got it
But you know what
've stopped giving a shit
You're going down, and Martinez is getting out, and that's all  care about
() 122
(') When they stick that needle in your arm, that will be me
And what if  don't go down
But Mick's finished, ready to leave, though Louis persists
(') Because  don't think they have enough to hold me
could be out by tomorrow
You've got women, you've got a daughter
At this, Mick's head snaps to him, angrily
(') You can't protect everybody
Kurlen arrives, takes Louis's elbow
Mick's already moving to the elevators
watched by
-  -   -  - catches up as  reaches the Lincoln
Stops him
They move to beneath an overhang, where they're almost dry
Please tell me you've got enough on Louis for the murder of Renteria
We will
We have the ticket
What ticket
The parking ticket, that Raul found
That was the phone message he left you
(Sees Mick doesn't know) Raul checked
Louis got one at a meter outside the victim's place, same time she was murdered
What about Raul's murder
Do you have him for that
123
No
We still don't know how he could have slipped the tracer anklet
(before Mick can ask more) Haller
Leave it alone
He hesitates-- but goes
Into the rain
Gets into-- () - He watches Sobel hurry back to courthouse through rain
When: Mr
Haller
Got that thing you asked for
And he hands Mick something wrapped in a towel:
Mick, puts it away, in the armrest

Cut to, -
Out steps Hayley, safe into Maggie's arms
Sitter looks on as Maggie hugs her

Where he was shot
He's alert but still
130
Then rouses more as he  feet come up the front steps
' (forces out the words) They're down

Suddenly  &  are through the door-- Lankford sees Mary on the floor, while-- Don't move, Haller-- She rushes to him
Lankford's already on his phone-- This is Lankford, we've got a shooting, twelve-twelve Creek off Laurel, we need paramedics, ambulance transport for two-- During which he's checking Mary Windsor's body, revises-- (') Transport for one
Rings off
Sobel takes Mick's hand, presses it to his wound-- Press hard and keep pressing
Mick's hand is on a blood-soaked hole, hurting like hell
while Lankford makes another call
Yeah, it's Lankford again
Tell them it's over, they can grab Roulet and bring him in
He what
(-- ) So, bring him to the Emergency Room first, then bring him in
(rings off; to Sobel) Dig this
The uniforms had some help picking up Roulet
Some motorcycle gang was already beating the shit out of him
(figures it out--) The police were tailing him

(She levels
) We thought he'd come after you
We couldn't tell you
The truth is we had plenty on him for killing Renteria

But we wanted Roulet for Levin, too

The tree off Mick's porch
Hayley's skinny legs climb nimbly from branch to branch
From the angle, we can tell someone is watching her

Nimble
And so pretty
Watching is: -    - Recovering, but not fully there beside him
didn't know you were awake
He looks at her
Questioning
(') Don't worry, we haven't been living here
We did, for a while
When you were touch and go
Mick
Returns his gaze to-- , going branch to branch
(') 'd better get her down, she can get hurt up there-- You can get hurt anywhere
Let her climb
An almost normal tone of voice
She smiles
