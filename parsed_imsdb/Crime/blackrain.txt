href <b>// --> </b> by Craig Bolotin Warren Lewis November 1987 : Various voices:	  "Big six"
"That's six the hard way"
"Seven or eleven"
"Play two"
: -    - One of the pristine blocks of brownstones where even the garbage seems gift wrapped
The  continue over as we move in on a particular building where a  is holding open the door for a dowager and her poodle
The voices continue:  "Hit me"
"Double down"
"Let it ride"
"Hit me"
"Anymore for the come out"
"Card"
In contrast to the outside of this sedate, quiet brownstone, we go inside to find
a miniature Las Vegas, complete with music, drinks, tuxedoed dealers and croupiers:  roulette, craps, Black Jack
Wall to wall people
The fact that casino gambling happens to be illegal in New York doesn't stop these Connecticut slummers, hollow-cheek nightlifers, and junior wiseguys from having a good time
, holding a dollar cigar, is trying to pull a winning hand
In his late thirties, Nick has the sort of quiet good looks that takes an extra glance to appreciate
His Moe Ginsburg rent-a-tux is too tight, his ruffled shirt, out of date; Nick could care less
Two other players are still in the game
One of them is a lithe  surrounded by an entourage of giggling friends and tuxedoed men
The pot is huge
Nick flips two one hundred dollar chips onto the pot
One, and one on top
House sees
(hesitates) 'm out
Disgusted, he throws down his cards
It's down to Nick and the debutante
The cocky deb gives Nick a long look, confident she can win
(her eyes still on Nick) see the deuce, and one to chase them home
She throws her chips on the pot
Nick hesitates, then decides to match it
Call
(showing her hand) Ladies, aces wired
Sorry sport
Nick turns over his cards, Jacks and tens, not good enough to win
Elated, the deb gets up from the table and joins her giggling friends
Nick walks over to her
Very nice, Barbie
(pointing toward her boyfriend) Now, 'd take Ken over there and go home
Why's that
It's time
That's all
The lady wants to play
Someone should teach you to be a better loser, loser
Listen, Ken -- My name is not Ken -- -- 'm offering you the benefit of my experience
Looks like you have a lot of experience in places like this
It was nice of them to relax the dress code for you
That draws a laugh from her friends
The entourage heads for the bar
, twenty-three, steps in front of the debutante, blocking her path
She steps to the side
Charlie steps with her
Charlie's pushing it, he's always pushing it
She's not amused
Finally, Charlie lets her pass
He comes up to Nick
Typical New York woman, big attitude, small apartment, no tits
Only two things count to Charlie:  his job and his women, but not necessarily in that order
think she got to you, pappy
(checking his watch) You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor
And don't call me 'pappy
' (glancing at the door) Still, you gotta wonder how she'd look in handcuffs
Nick, wary, eyes this kid
Charlie shrugs, spreads his arms defensively
The  of pounding on the front door
splinters
The bouncer steps back as four helmeted emergency service officers -- the first members of the raiding party -- rush in
Pandemonium
People rush for the exit -- any exit
Nick and Charlie hold up their glasses
(calmly) Alley oop
They down their drinks, then set them down
Charlie pulls out the Binaca, offering Nick a spritz, but Nick is already pulling out his   and hanging it around his neck
Charlie quickly follows suit
line the patrons up against the wall
The Asst
, , climbs onto the crap table
petite, nervous woman, Patty has dressed in a Channel suit for the occasion
Settle down
Hey, quiet
Please
Not a prayer
,
That quiets them
My name is Conklin
Let's do this fast so  can go home
Zachara, annoyed, looks at Nick
(softer) It's all yours
(reads) Under section 216 of the New York State Penal code,  serve notice that this premise and it's occupants
catches the Debutante's eye across the room
She smiles at him, he was right
He shrugs, spreads his hands
That's life
well groomed middle aged man, who we'll come to know as , suddenly bolts from the crowd lined up against the wall
Charlie spins around to stop him -- Whoa -- where do you think you're going, hotdog
Cavello butts him with his head, sending Charlie to the floor
Then, crosses his arms in front of his face and plunges through the
Nick, not missing a beat, gives a small sigh as he follows
(sighs) Fabulous
He takes off after him
- Nick, short of breath, chases Cavello down the residential street, past the dog-walkers, past the doormen, past the fur-coated women climbing out of taxies
Unfortunately, Cavello has a good half block on him
From nowhere, Charlie blasts past leaving Nick a half block behind, silently cursing his age
a limo jerks to a halt, and Cavello jumps in
The limo streaks away
turns to see Nick, hands on knees, gasping for air
: -    - Now in their street clothes, Charlie and Nick stand in front of the mirrors
Charlie is working his brush and hair dryer as if his life depended on it
Nick, in contrast, shoves his hair back with his fingers and glowers at himself in the mirror
(over the dryer) It's not like you were slow or anything
think you did just fine
think you did great
Thanks
Nick turns to leave
Hey, hey, where you goin'
Home
- Nick strides out the door
Charlie hurries after him
Wait up
You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window -- -- Cavello
Ronnie Cavello
Charlie trails Nick to his motorcycle:  a Harley hog complete with wide gleaming fenders and twin tanks
The bike is held together with tape and baling wire
You know him
Nick tries to kick-start this behemoth, but it's not easy
He works for Frank Abolofia
Atlantic City
Casinos
So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust
Charlie puts his foot up on Nick's fender to tie his shoe
Nick, spotting an ankle holster peeking from Charlie's sock, grabs Charlie's foot
Charlie teeters
What's this
Let go
Nick pulls out a Beretta 32
Back-up
Get rid of it
Why
It's not regulation
And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat
(looking at Nick's bike) 'll get rid of it when you get rid of the egg-beater
The Harley comes to life spitting a cloud of blue smoke
Nick puts on his paint-flecked helmet, slides down some ski goggles
Nick, let's go hunting
Bag Cavello
Charlie
Nick pops the bike into gear
You still got shaving cream on your ear
Nick rolls out and disappears in a haze of blue smoke
-   - Nick, a lonely, solitary figure bobbing in and out of the lights and shadows
The  of wind whips through his helmet; cold air stings his cheeks
The tail lights of Nick's bike disappear into the night
-   - Civil service heaven
Nick hits the cut switch and glides past the manicured lawns and well kept houses of this development
basketball net in every driveway, a Buick or Chrysler in every garage
One house sticks out
The lawn is brown, paint is peeling off the garage door and newspapers are scattered on the driveway
Nick glides once around the cul de sac looking at the house
His house
It's as inviting as an open grave
He shoots away
-   - hanger sized roadhouse, wall to wall red velvet
Nick's the sole figure at the counter, coffee and the Daily News in front of him
walks in and sits down a half dozen seats away
Nick look up
Short shift
Yeah
came to save you
If you're hopeless, 'll pull the plug
: '  -  - Nick and Connie are in bed
They're both looking up at the ceiling
They've just made love
It's getting too cold even for me, Nick
Connie
All right, how's the new partner
High spirits, desire, commitment
You'll take care of that
Give me a break, would you
If you give me one
Nick kisses her
The first suggestion of real affection
The  of someone  on the door
Reluctantly, they stop
Connie gets up and puts on her robe
Are you expecting anyone
wasn't expecting you
She disappears down the hallway
We  the door open, then telling someone to wait
(poking her head in the room) Imagine a small, greasy Boy Scout
: ' Nick, wearing only his pants, is doing a slow burn
Charlie is holding his hands up defensively
found the goombah
Cavello
He's -- --  should tear your head off
Whoa,  knew you were going to say that
absolutely anticipated that, Nick
But  said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus
He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him -- -- Hey,  got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up
Charlie looks away momentarily, letting it slide
He knows he's on sensitive ground
Look
they told me at the Greek's you were here
'm sorry, never imagined
(buddy buddy) like her
She's nice
(lowering his voice) For her age
The bedroom door opens
Connie enters, dumps Nick's clothes on the couch, tosses his gun on top of the pile
Without a word, she goes back inside and slams the door behind her
Nick, pissed, slowly turns to face Charlie
Charlie shrugs
Nick's got nothing better to do than go
: -  - The Lime House is a little piece of Italy in the heart of Chinatown, and tonight, it's packed
Any selection on the jukebox that isn't Frank Sinatra is Jerry Vale
Behind the bar are two fat
One pours drinks, the other dishes out Scungilli
It's three a
m
It's always three a
m
at the Lime House
Our man  is unloading steaming Scungilli onto an already heaping plate in front of an imperious looking The Japanese Man, in his mid-fifties, wears a gray suit, and not a strand of his jet black hair is out of place
Japanese , doing his best to translate Cavello's heavily accented English, sits between them
Charlie is looking straight ahead, afraid Cavello might peg him
Nick is at ease
What are they doing now
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked
Who do you think the Jap is
Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru
How would  know
don't blame you for being sore
It'll pass when we bag him
Charlie, trying to relax, gestures toward his foot
Whatdaya think
'Bostonians'
Eighty-five bucks
(lowering his voice) Girls go for shoes
Second place they look
(off Nick's reaction) Hey,  read it in a magazine
Nick's attention is drawn to a trio walking in the door
(dead serious) Charlie, don't do anything
Promise me
What
:    are making a quick sweep of the bar
, s stocky man with silver grey hair, sweeps in behind them
Abolofia has mitts like a meat packer and a fifty dollar manicure
heavyweight Mafioso
Frank Abolofia
The Wolf
Abolofia walks to Cavello's table
All rise and shake hands
The two hitters take seats at the bar
The two brothers scramble to serve their distinguished guests
(in a whisper) Some party
Maybe we should do something
Charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm
Nick turns away, resumes his drink
'       :  two new Japanese men step in the door
Early twenties, spiky hair, dark Versace suits
wears tortoise shell shades
He coolly checks out the room then nods to -- who pulls a Spas 12, automatic shotgun from under his coat, and spits out three rounds
window shatters
Everyone hits the floor
slowly walks toward Cavello's table
covers the floor
Abolofia's bodyguards show their empty hands
on the floor
They don't have the artillery for this guy either
Our Japanese businessman knows these people
He eyes them contemptuously
Abolofia has put enough people in this situation to be philosophical about it
He stops chewing
tiny hand motion to his bodyguards is enough to stop any precipitous action
(in Japanese) Give it to me
The Japanese businessman looking straight ahead
long, silent pause
Then, still not facing him: (in Japanese) Go to hell
Number One slips his fingers beneath his shades, massaging his eyes
, he pulls a shuto from under his coat
The 18 inch blade gleams like a neon tube
He presses the tip of the blade against the businessman's throat
his hand close around the grip of the Beretta
He unsnaps the ankle holster
The  can be heard across the room
Nick's hand closes around Charlie's and squeezes till the knuckles turn white
(in a whisper) What are you doing
Saving your life
levels the scattergun at Nick and Charlie
- calmly holds the blade at the man's throat as he reaches into the man's jacket and removes a small, rectangular, plastic-wrapped parcel
He feels its weight, then flips it to
Abolofia, realizing that whatever is going on doesn't affect him or his, resumes eating
You people are wild
Wild
backs the blade off
The man raises his napkin to the small wound
droplet of blood has stained his shirt collar
turns around as if to leave
What happens next could be a whim, an after thought
Number One spins around and  the blade deep into the man's chest
He withdraws it with a half twist, and in the same motion fatally slashes the translator's throat before the old man's body hits the floor
Blood pours from the businessman's mouth onto his Scungilli, spreading across the white cloth and onto the floor
reaches for a gun under his coat
But   pumps two rounds into his face
At this range, there's not much left
The killers slowly back out the door, covering the room with the scattergun
The minute the door shuts, Nick leaps up, pulling his shield and revolver
(shouting) Police officers
Everybody stay put
(to Charlie) Get back up
Abolofia's eyebrows rise at this development
Nick bolts out the door leaving Charlie in charge
He's never been in charge before
(nervously showing shield) Police
- Lincoln tears around the corner to pick the killers up
Nick flies out the Lime House door and hits the ground
Number Two pumps out shells as fast as he can squeeze the trigger
He's wild
The front windows of the Lime House shatter
The   jerks to a halt
Number Two tosses the package to him
Nick empties his revolver
Number Two goes down
The driver floors the accelerator, leaving Number One to take off on foot
Nick follows, reloading as he runs
Everyone's frozen on the floor
Call 911
Tell them an officer needs assistance
Say ten thirteen
Nothing from the owner who looks at Abolofia
Charlie grabs the owner by his collar and shoves him toward the phone
Do it, you dumb bastard
Suddenly Charlie feels something wet at his feet
He looks down to see that he's standing in a pool of blood from the massacre
So much for his new shoes
He wheels around, then quickly backs out the door
- Deserted
The wail of police sirens in the distance
Charlie has his gun out
He's drenched in sweat
Where is his partner
Shit
: -  - Nick, gun drawn, slowly rounds the corner to the alley: it's the ad hoc drugstore for the night
Drugs going up and down in pails, two dozen junkies buying, shooting, slumped on the ground
Everyone scatters -- the one's that can
swings slowly back and forth from three stories up
Nick cautiously moves down the alley, holding the gun in both hands
Junkie steps out of a doorway, Nick swings his gun and nearly blows him away
We see his eyes first as he steps out of the darkness at the back of the alley
From now on we'll call him
His sunglasses are on his forehead; his hands dropped casually at his side
very cool character
Kobo slowly raises his hand, and making a gun with his finger, slowly points and "shoots" at Nick
He lowers his hand
On the ground, man
Kobo cups his hands around his ear
He doesn't understand English
Nick, keeping his gun fixed, comes up to him and kicks out his legs
Kobo falls flat on his chest
Nick pulls out his cuffs
But Kobo lunges for Nick's ankle and yanks it toward him
Nick stumbles backward; Kobo's on his feet
Before Nick can stand, Kobo lands a brutal kick to the side of Nick's head
Nick gets up, barrels into him
Kobo knees Nick in the solar plexus, then lands two more well placed kicks in Nick's back
It's not that Nick's a bad fighter, it's that this kid is so damn fast
Nick slowly gets to his feet
lands two more brutal shots to the side of Nick's head
He's a bloody mess
stop at the end of the alley
climb out
joins the cops as they run down the alley to find Nick getting pummeled
Charlie shoots at Kobo
Misses
Kobo turns to see the five cops, guns drawn
Nick, on one knee, spits out blood and a few teeth
Kobo calmly slips the shuto out of his coat pocket and drops it next to Nick
The blade gleams in the light
That was next
Nick got lucky
Kobo towers imperiously above Nick
Their eyes lock
We hold then
: '   -   - There isn't a stick of furniture, but that's not the half of it
In the middle of the room is a motorcycle on a centerstand
drop cloth is spread around it, tools neatly aligned
It's a Harley -- but this one is in perfect condition
phone  insistently from off screen, then stops
(
) Yeah
sure, sure 'll be down
Nick walks in, naked
Every muscle aches
One side of his face is completely swollen
He has a band-aid over his right eye; some blood caked on his earlobe
He stops to twist a spark plug in with a ratchet, but it snaps
: -   - , early forties, walks between Charlie and Nick as they head toward the Medical Examiner's room
Oliver doesn't face Nick as he speaks; no love lost between these two
How big a package we talking about
(holding up his hands) This by this
Dope
Not in that company
The old man was a Japanese paper manufacturer
Hotel room and rental car were full of it
Full of what
(annoyed) Art and stationary paper
Cavello had five hundred thousand in his attache case
Nick rubs the back of his neck in obvious pain
One guy do all the damage
Yeah
Thought you knew your way around dark alleys, detective
Oliver goes through the swinging doors into the Examiner's room
Charlie shoots Nick a look
Nick let's it slide
is showing the night's harvest to Charlie, Nick and Oliver
They're standing over the body of the middle- aged Japanese man
The old man's suit was Japanese
The hitter's was Saville row
No We're doing a peel now
Another techie is carefully removing the skin from Number Two's fingertips
Charlie shuts his eyes and turns away, trying not to throw up
There's something you got to see
He whips back the sheet, the body is nude
towel covers the genitals
Except for the feet, hands, neck, and face, the body is covered with elaborate tattoos:  flowers and blood, dragons and snakes
What's wrong with this picture
(nervously) got a tattoo
Birdie on the ball
We all got them when we finished basic at Camp Lejune
Charlie
thought you guys were trained observers
They look up surprised
The techie picks up a hand
The third and forth fingers have been neatly amputated
Eight fingers
(ironically) Hey, it was a trick question
: is seated in chair next to his
Nick, Oliver, and a third detective are grilling him
He was with a friend, sure
shake hands with the guy and a minute later he's bleeding all over my socks
Will that do officers
My client has had a terrible shock
Yeah, he's not used to seeing other people do the killing
won't tolerate harassment
What about the package
We know nothing about it
Silence
Abolofia looks at Nick, then at Oliver
Hard to believe a trained police officer could let this kind of thing happen right in front of his face
did make a mistake
let the wrong guy get hit
Abolofia doesn't blink an eye, goes for the jugular
Cheer up, Nick
'm sure it's easier to pick a dead man's pocket
Nick springs from his feet
Oliver grabs Nick before he can get close to Abolofia
That's it, we're through
: the Japanese killer who smashed in Nick's face last night
He's sitting in an interrogation room an hour later with a and a
He won't talk
Nick and Oliver watching through the glass
Doesn't speak a word of English
And he won't speak Japanese either
No papers
The Japanese embassy is very interested
Why
He's wanted in Japan
They want him first
Then we can have him
What
Oliver nods
That's the way it is
he turns and looks at Nick
He can't possibly see him through the one way glass but he knows Nick's there
looking at him
making a cutting mark across his forehead, right where Nick's bandage is
It's uncanny
: '  - Nick is sitting in front of Oliver's desk
The sunlight makes him wince; wincing makes his face hurt
Japanese embassy talks to state department
State talks to police plaza
They to me and me to you
Shit rolls down hill
Oliver drops a file folder on the desk
Nick opens it: petty cash, vouchers and plane tickets
You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight
What
What if  say no
Check your gun before you leave
They're not allowed in Japan
It's a nice, safe country
Why me
They said send a detective if could spare one
(then) can always spare you
Nick bridles at the insult
Oliver's had a hard-on for Nick for years, and Nick's tired of it
(soft) You got something to say to me, Captain
Oliver doesn't want to get into it
Yeah
Have a wonderful flight
: on the tail of a Japan Airlines 747
driving rain storm
The plane taxies down the runway and disappears into the black rain
Kobo, handcuffed and shackled, is in the center seat
Nick and Charlie sit on either side
Charlie is holding "Bachelors Japan" in one hand
Nick's in a sour mood
Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere
was thinking the Poconos, Charlie
Maybe Vegas
What are you missing
Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house
That shit is sadder than Ethiopia
Beats forty hours on a plane
They say we got to turn around and come right back
That's what they say
got a plan
The last thing Nick wants to hear -- too late
call, right
say  got the dreaded thirty six-hour Asian shits from some raw clam and we stretch it into three days
You and  become a driving force on the local Geisha scene
Not a prayer
(grinning) Hey, come on, big guy like you, cop from New York
You're gonna be the biggest thing to hit town since Godzilla
Nick can't help but smile at this kid
Charlie looks down at the guide book
Says here, it's very impolite to touch someone while you're talking to them
(nudges Kobo) Guess that means you can't talk and screw at the same time, huh, hotdog
What's the matter, no -- speaky-the- language
Understand this:  You will never ever fuck with my partner again
Nothing from Kobo who is looking straight ahead
He doesn't understand
Shut-up, Charlie
beat, then Charlie reads a Japanese phrase from the book
slight facial response from Kobo
Charlie tries it again
This time Kobo laughs openly
What'd you say
Where is the subway station, please
Kobo keeps laughing; it's obviously not what Charlie said
Get a new book
: - The cabin is now darkened
Kobo and Nick are asleep
Not Charlie, he's still at his book, and listening to U2 on his Walkman
Nick rolls over and opens his eyes to see Charlie watching him
He shuts them hoping to avoid talk
Too late
Nick
You up
No
Charlie removes his headphones
Nick, have  been a good partner
Number five with a bullet
Nick shuts his eyes
just want you to know
mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me
Go to sleep, Charlie
You didn't take, did you
You hear things
Nick opens his eyes
worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie
(surprised) didn't know
The lieutenant was on the pad along with the rest of the squad
was new, didn't know shit
When the feathers flew,  got called in front of the special prosecutor
It's on the top of my personnel file
They think 'm dirty or  cut a deal
Doesn't leave you with a lot of friends either way
Nick shuts his eyes
might as well have done something
've been paying for it every goddamn day since  got transferred
on Nick then
: -  - Nick and Charlie, with Kobo between them, are a strange sight in a sea of Japanese faces
Kobo's hands are cuffed behind his back
Nick also has Kobo cuffed to his wrist
The cops are rumpled, exhausted, showing two days of stubble
Kobo looks sharp and wide awake
pair of attractive teenage girls walks past them
Whoa
Nick, we're in paradise
of white gloved hands belonging to a Tokyo police officer holds up a small, hand letter sign that says: /
The man holding the sign is
Two other police officers in spotless tan uniforms stand at his side
Nick, holding Kobo by his arm, steps up to the police and show his
Nagashima bows
Officers Conklin and -- and
(he can't say Charlie's name) gentlemen, welcome
am assistant inspector Nagashima
They show their
You going to take this crap off our hands
(confused) Crap
Oh, the prisoner
Yes
He barks some orders to the officers who immediately take Kobo by the arms and put cuffs on him
Nick unfastens his cuff when they're through
In contrast to Nagashima's gentility, the cops are rough with the prisoner
(extends his hand) Charlie
Kon-ich-iwa
Nagashima shakes his hand
Bows
Charlie bows back
Nick wouldn't bow if his life depended on it
Nagashima hands Nick an official looking document
If you will please give this to the customs inspector he will expidate -- expedite you
We have a car and a driver outside
Right
(bows) Arigato
Nick grabs Charlie by the arm and starts for the customs line
Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun
Hey, when in Rome -- In Rome, 'll bow
: - and  make their way through the crowd toward the head of a long line
They dump their bags on the counter
The , furious that they have taken cuts in line, barks at them in Japanese
Inspector Nagashima told me to give you this
He hands the Inspector the official looking document
The Inspector scans the paper
Hands it back to them
(broken English) You must get in line behind the rest
We're cops
Pol-ice-men
The Inspector signals a nearby
The Inspector says something in Japanese
Hands the policeman the document
The policeman shakes his head, amused, points to the end of the line
Fellas, get serious
From off screen someone  : (
) Nick
Nick and Charlie turn to see , their prisoner, standing on the other side of the thick plastic divider
The handcuffs are off
The three alleged 'policemen' are heading out the door behind him
It was a set-up:  Nick and Charlie have been had
(perfect English) Thanks for the ride, detective
He slowly backs away from the glass as if he had all the time in the world, finally disappearing in the crowd
: trying to shove past the customs inspectors who are wrestling them aside
Cops
He's our prisoner
Two more policemen arrive
Nick and Charlie are thrown up against the wall
Out come the cuffs
What's going on
We're the good guys
: - Fifty identical desks
Fifty identical phones
Fifty identically dressed men in white shirts and ties working under the fluorescent lights of this large open room
We   the rows of desk to find  , mid forties, sitting behind a perfectly arranged desk
Ohashi prides himself on order
Nick and Charlie are standing in front of him
Get me something like an Identi-Kit and 'll give you a description
Ohashi remains poker faced
He continues to arrange papers and apply his hanko (personal seal) to the bottom of a stack of official papers
There must be some witnesses from the airport
Still nothing from the good inspector
What is it, tea time
Still nothing from Ohashi
Finally: (quiet rage) You lost a man we wanted for some time
It was very incompetent on your part, officer
Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents
Ohashi bows slightly, we're not sure why
want a gun
It is not allowed
We're police officers
You're foreigners
Work with me
want your best detective
Pause
Ohashi returns to his papers
Nick can't believe it
Hey, inspector,  don't intend to take the rap for this
(not looking up) Do you know what this is
Ohashi holds up the document that was handed to Nick at the airport
It's a laundry list
Go home, detective
Nick studies him for a beat, then turns away
To Charlie: Let's go
Nick, we can't just -- said let's go, Charlie
Reluctantly they head towards the door, passing long rows of bureaucrats, telephones ringing off the hook
Nick stops at the door, spots a fuse box nearby
He glances back to make sure no one is looking
Nick pulls out his handcuffs
Charlie can't figure out what the hell he's doing
Nick attaches one cuff to the main lever then yanks it down
The lights go out
The fan's stop; so do the typewriters; so does the air conditioning
Dead silence
Nick attaches the other cuff to a pipe, snaps it shut
Now it's impossible to left the main lever
From the far end of the room: What are you doing
Nick drops the key down the water fountain drain
Your best detective, Ohashi
: - Nick and Charlie cross the street
Charlie's trying to read the name from the piece of paper Ohashi has given them
Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto
Hey, we're getting Mr
Moto on our side
Let's grab some food
First decent idea you've had
Charlie pulls out his 'Footloose in Tokyo" book, flips through the pages
Food
Food, here we go
Tokyo offers a wide variety of food
It's best to sample the local specialties, including sashaimi, soba, and world renown Kobe beef
Nick goes into a restaurant
Charlie drops the book, disgusted with Nick's choice
Charlie reluctantly follows him in
it's a Shakey's Pizza restaurant
: -   - Rows of post-modern buildings of odd shaped windows and brightly painted concrete walls
Nick and Charlie are searching for the Japanese cop's building
They can't speak the language; they can't read the signs; and half the buildings don't have numbers
It's a nightmare
This should be it
You said that in the last two places
Charlie holds out the paper to a passing man
Kore
Doku
Kore doku
The man gestures toward the building Charlie was pointing to
Okay, you were right
Charlie grins, satisfied
-  - The boys are knocking on a door
Nick turns the handle
It's unlocked
four tatami room
An unholy mess:  Food packages, beer bottles, stacks of papers and file folders
Framed pictures of long dead relatives hang on the wall
This the right place
hope not
now appears at the door
Middle aged, wizened face, in a full traditional Kimono
Konichiwa
Ichiro Matsumoto
The woman babbles bird-like in rapid Japanese
She bows
They're in the right place
: -   - The jammed streets are barely wide enough to get a motorcycle down
It's a bad neighborhood, one of the poorest in Tokyo
We spot the small kimono clad , clip-clopping on wooden geta, leading Nick and Charlie through this labyrinth
(looking around) Getting very weird
'd feel better if we had some heat
Maybe we should bail
Seeing they've stopped, the woman gestures for them to hurry up, then disappears around the corner
(looking at the maze of streets) Think we could find our way back
: - poor man's idea of a bar
The woman points inside, chirps away in Japanese, bows, then hurries off leaving Nick and Charlie on their own
Nick and Charlie disappear into darkness as the woven flaps shut behind them
vintage wurlitzer juke box glows across the room
An Enka plays
(Haunting Japanese blues
) '  (  ) Big shots from New York
like your style
steps into a pool of light just inches from them
He is a short overweight man looking every minute of his fifty-five years
His white short sleeve shirt is too tight; his narrow tie spotted in the middle; his collar soaked in sweat
He's not drunk yet, but he's been at it a while
Call him Ich
(bowing) Detective Ichiro Matsumoto
'm the man you're looking for
This is Ohashi's best man
Well, at least he speaks English
The man you are looking for, Kobo, was a member of the Samaguchi-gummi
Yakuza
Ich nods, offers them what's left of his Sapphoro beer
They shake their heads
Ich finishes it
Where do we start looking for this guy
Where would you look for the mafia
The back room at Lombardi's after the Columbus Day Parade
Under the bed
In the mayor's office
Everywhere
Ich heads for the door without saying a word
Where're you going, Ichiro
(stops, faces them) The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's
(tucking in his shirt tail) And call me Ich
: -   - Imagine an ultra modern indoor shopping mall, except there aren't any stores
The only product sold here is pleasure:  Bars, hostess clubs, Turkish baths
post- modern red light district with music piped in and automated doormen
Hip, younger Japanese are wedged together at the long chrome bar
The  sport leather jackets and Raybans
The  are decked out in fifties American party dresses and short cropped hair
Jerry Lee Lewis wails in the background
Nick, Ich and Charlie are at one end of the long bar
Ich is drinking them both under the table
(singing) "Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire
" (raising glass for toast) To the killer
Jerry Lee Lewis
(checking his watch) Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's
Let's book, Charlie
If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night
No, this is the place for the young Yakuza
That's what you said in the last three piss pots
Ich sets down his drink, pours more sake for Nick and Charlie then for himself
He's having a great time
love you people
The music, the clothes, the movies
Japanese respect only what is Japanese
Nick glances at Charlie
It's incredible
Hit him or something
don't think he'd feel it
(beginning to slur his words) Americans change everything
When was young the city was wood and paper
was ten when the bombers came
lived underground for three days
When  came up, the city was gone
ball of fire
Nick gets to his feet
Ich grabs him by the arm, stopping him
It began to rain, Nick
You know what color the rain was
Ich doesn't give him a chance to answer
Black
It was black from the ash
Very impressive
You Americans, you could make black rain
Ich polishes off his drink
An awkward silence
Charlie, wanting to lighten the mood -- (leaning close) Say Ich, between friends, where can grab some squish around here
Nick sighs, digs in his pocket for some yen for the bill
Squid
Pussy, ass, soft personnel
Ich looks up to see a picturesque, blood-haired American in a tight silk blouse and skirt
She works here and has obviously heard Charlie
Ah, Joyce
(in Japanese) How are you tonight
(in Japanese) Hello, Ich
Johnny Walker
Ich nods
Joyce's Japanese is impeccable
She's a part- time bartender, translator, model
One of Japan's western wanderers
She's sliding past thirty, but only her weary eyes give it away
She is about to pour Ich another drink
Don't give him any more
He gets as much as he wants
Charlie extends his hand to Joyce
She ignores it
Hello hello, Charlie Skloaris
New York City
She refills Ich's glass
My partner and  are cops
(lowering his voice) We're on a very big assignment here
(nothing from Joyce) When do you get off
Right when you're being tucked into bed
Cold
You should be nicer to my American friends, Joyce
They wouldn't appreciate it, Ich
Trust me
She says something in Japanese to Ich as she eyes the cops
Then, she walks off
Joyce can be nice
(brightening) What'd she say
(big smile) That  should let you pay for the drinks
(raising his glass) Kampai
: - Charlie and Nick are trying to help a besotted Ich find a taxi, but no one will take him
Ich is shouting half English, half Japanese phrases
We got to keep looking
Track him down
Great balls of fire
(frustrated, to a cabbie) What's the problem here
The cabbie ignores them
(
) You don't speak the language
'll drop him off
They turn to see Joyce standing behind them
Ah, Joyce
The rest is slurred Japanese
Joyce speaks to a cabbie in Japanese
The rear door swings open
She helps Ich in
Joyce climbs in
(out the window) See you tomorrow
The taxi pulls away
Nick and Charlie watch it go
Not a prayer
: -
An early morning wind jostles the red paper lantern and plucks at the tails of dragon-like banners hanging outside the shops
Nick and Charlie are walking down this narrow sidestreet on the way back to their hotel
He's a sorry old guy, but  like him
He couldn't find his ass with both hands
brand new Kawasaki 1000 motorcycle with windshield and full farings gleams under a street light
Now that's the kind of motorcycle want to see you on
(muttering) Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket
Nick, how we gonna bag this guy without any help
Maybe  should work on that girl Joyce, she speaks the language
Nick glances over at his partner, smiles
But before he can respond -- The   of a half dozen motorcycles in the distance breaks the pre-dawn stillness
() on their multi-cylinder high tech street bombers, creep around the corner and slowly ride toward Nick and Charlie
We get a better look at them:  turbo punk Elvis-samurai hybrids -- some wearing a slipper under their headbands, courtesy of their girlfriends; some in leopard skin pants
And tattoos
They head straight for Nick and Charlie, then, at the last moment, split and float away   , as if the cops didn't exist
Suddenly, the street is empty again
Silent except for the  of the wind beating against paper lanterns, rustling the wind chimes
Hold on Nick and Charlie standing in the middle of the street, realizing just how far away from home they are
: - rocket shaped building:  a mixture of Dutch Gable and Japanese Minka roof
The mid-day sun beats down on a particular room
Nick and Charlie are sacked out
They never bothered to pull the curtains
at the door
(
) Nick
Give us a break
(
) It's Ichiro
Ich
Leave the rice cake outside and go home
But Ich persists
As Nick opens up
Ich bows
He's now clean shaven and has put on a clean shirt
There's been a murder
Yakuza
You should come
: - The murder scene
: in the claws of six foot working robotic
The tattooed covered legs swing back and forth like a pendulum
is wedged in between two enormous printing rollers
is resting in the middle of a conveyer belt
It's been drenched in black printer's ink which has begun to congeal
Ich, Charlie, and Nick, watching
Charlie has the dry heaves
as we reveal the full crime scene
Instead of the usual cigar smoke, camera flashes and radio chatter, there is order and quiet
slow underwater dance
quietly gives an order
Someone turns off the robotic
The severed legs stop swinging
Nick, Charlie and Ich walk over to Ohashi
Ich bows deeply
Ohashi doesn't acknowledge any of them, talks to a man holding a tape measurer
Could you fill me in
Why don't you ask your chief detective
Ich looks down at the floor
Because  want you to tell me
The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here
Can we skip the poetry, inspector
Ohashi pauses
Ich looks at Nick as if to warn him he can't speak to Ohashi that way
There's a war, detective, between two rival groups
The man who escaped, Kobo, leads the younger group
They did this
Kobo's a wild boy
He was a lieutenant in the Sammaguchi-gummi
(in Japanese) Excellent, Officer Matsumoto
How is your investigation going
(in Japanese) Well, sir
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to work with these distinguished gentlemen
He bows
It's pathetic
Looking for clues in the bottom of a sake bottle, Matsumoto
Laughter all around
He's an officer of great distinction
Another sarcastic dig
Ich stoically stands and takes it
Hey, Ich has been helpful
(ignoring him, to Nick) Have you changed your mind and decided to go home, detective
Not until one of us bags Kobo
(looking at the corpse) And it doesn't look like you're doing so hot
Ohashi coolly flicks the ashes of his cigarette and we -- : - Ich, Nick, and Charlie are threading their way through the crowd toward the subway entrance
, their hair slicked back, watch the trio from the top of two different subway entrances
As soon as Ich, Nick and Charlie go down the steps, they climb off their bikes and follow
Nick, Ich and Charlie are riding the people mover that stretches the length of this endless tunnel
They're sandwiched between the legions of  (white collar workers) who all wear identical blue suits and white shirts
Nick looks over at Ich, who is still suffering in silence from the recent humiliation
You know, Inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever
(beat) don't deserve Ohashi's respect
Why the hell not
don't, that's all
Ich looks away, obviously uncomfortable
You cool, Ich
Cool
You all right
You okay
Ich nods
What does Ichiro mean, anyway
(smiling) What does Charlie mean
Hey, all right
Charlie slaps Ich on the back
smiles at Charlie's remark
He can't help but like this wide-eyed goofy kid
Something makes Nick's smile fade
' , their escaped prisoner, hurrying in the opposite direction
His Kamali suit looks like it just came from the cleaners
Charlie
Charlie spots him
In a flash, the two men jump the railing and charge after him, leaving Ich in their wake
Ich can't possibly make it over the side
He furiously shoves his way through the Salarymen, trying to get to the end of the walkway
-- Nick barreling through the mass of faceless Salarymen
-- Kobo, hurrying ahead, occasionally glancing back
-- Charlie catching up to Nick
They've lost him
They spin around
half dozen tunnels spin out in all directions
-- Nick and Charlie spotting Kobo
He's waiting for them near the turnstile
Nick suddenly realizes it's a set-up
Before he can say anything, Charlie sprints ahead, recklessly shoving people out of the way
(calling after him) It's a set-up
Charlie
Charlie hasn't heard him
Kobo hands a ticket to the turnstile guard and disappears onto the platform
Charlie doesn't have a ticket
The guard points to the automatic ticket machine
Screw it
Charlie leaps over the turnstile
The  blows his shrill whistle to signal the subway police
Charlie pushes through the crowd -- a wall of blank faces
Kobo is gone
shoving through the crowd
He spots Charlie
Shouts at him to wait
Charlie can't hear his partner
pulls in
An immaculately uniformed  blows his whistle and waves his white-gloved hands to keep the crowd back
shoves Charlie from behind; he stumbles forward toward the track
Someone catches him at the last moment
Charlie turns around to see it's Kobo
Kobo smiles, it's all a big joke
What follows happens in a flash: Charlie
Nick is close enough to see, too far to do anything
He's blocked by
He tries to shove past, but they grab him
holding Charlie by his coat lapels
An express train tears into the station
Kobo casually glances at trying to struggle free
his eyes still on Nick, drops Charlie in front of the speeding express as if he were a sack of laundry
woman
The train barrels through the station
Kobo starts toward Nick
He's next
pair of   burst through the crowd searching for Charlie because he vaulted the turnstile
manages to break free of the leatherboys holding him
They flee into the crowd as the police close in
- slips into the wave of commuters being shoved into a train by white-gloved
It's their job to shove commuters into the already packed cars
Nick goes for Kobo, but the crowd closes in front of him
He can't get through
slam shut
The train pulls out leaving Nick standing on the empty platform
streaks past him
Kobo stands in the rear window, getting smaller and smaller until the train disappears down the tracks
Nick
Ich, out of breath, is standing on the platform
Nick looks at him with disgust -- where the hell was he
on Nick, his head bowed, being surrounded by the sea of blue-suited commuters
: '  against a white wall
That's all we see
Ohashi's voice
(
) You ignored me
don't care about what you want
Get on a plane, detective Conklin
Go home
We  a door open and  shut off screen
Hold on Nick, frozen in place, then: : -
- Again, the fifty desks, fifty faceless men working
Typewriters , phones
We  down the rows to find Nick sitting behind one of the desks
He's on the phone to New York
(
) () It's not your job
He was my partner
(
) () They're blaming it on you
Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner
planned on catching him, Captain
(
) () How
You don't know the place
You don't know the language
Get on the plane
He killed a police officer
(
) () Your plane's at nine a
m
Be on it
That's orders
Period
Oliver hangs up
moment of long distance hum cross talk
Nick doesn't move
Pull back through the rows of cops busily working
Charlie Parker's alto sax   as we -- : - The  continues
The sax screams as the melody is abandoned
Nick is drunk
Roaring angry drunk
He doesn't know where he is
He doesn't care
He plows down the street, occasionally grabbing a passerby, then letting them go
Nick begins to laugh
couple is staring at him, Nick yells at them, but we '
He stumbles on
drop back to find
following in his wake
He bows and apologizes to the offended
: - Nick is thrown onto the street
He tries to reenter and is thrown out again
We spot  inside watching; she turns back to her customers
- Nick is hassling a news vendor who pointedly ignores him and continues selling his papers
Ich appears and apologizes to the news vendor
-
Nick's sitting on the curb, his head in his hands
People step around him
Across the street, out of Nick's sight, Ich is watching his partner, feeling every barb of Nick's shame
Charlie Parker continues over the slow
: -- asleep, the futon tangled around him
He opens his eyes
woman is making tea in the kitchenette
This is the kimonoed woman who led Nick and Charlie to Ich the other night
is on softly in the background
The Charlie Parker tune we've been listening to over the previous cuts ends, and the announcer comes on: That was the Bird, from the Blue Note years
1230 hours and 72 degrees in central Osaka
This is specialist Doug Dale, Tapestries in Jazz, on the Far East Network, armed forces radio
Nick slowly sits up to see seated at a low table looking at him from across the room
Nick spots his clothes and luggage stacked in the corner
Nick now realizes he's in Ich's apartment
It's spotless
Everything is now in its proper place
What happened
They made you leave your hotel
(looks away) you caused a disturbance
Nick's eyes fall on Charlie's things:  his sports clothes, his tour book, his shoes which Ich has stacked on the table
It may be too soon to talk about it
When someone we care for dies we
(beat) keep something of their's tie, a pen
Why weren't you at the platform
couldn't keep up
My shame is complete
Nick slowly shuts his eyes, his head pounding
: - The neighborhood bathhouse
Thick with steam and neighborhood kids
Nick walks toward the huge pool of water
Ich is beside him
Nick's about to climb in when Ich stops him, hands him a pail and a washcloth and points to the faucets along the wall where a dozen men squat on small stools as they wash themselves
: as he pours a pail of water over his head, it runs down his face in slow motion
: Nick soaking, on one side
Ich is soaking nearby
You must leave
Yeah
'll get him for you, Nick
Nick looks at this thick bellied, alcoholic cop
Not a very reassuring thought
carrying plastic pails cross in front of the tub
Young, muscular Yakuza, their bodies covered with exquisite tattoos
They stare openly at Nick
One makes a joke
Both laugh obscenely as they slip into the hot tub
Yakuza
Ich nods
Nick eyes them for a long beat, then climbs out of the tub
: Nick tossing two bags into a taxi in front of Ich's apartment building
Ich watching Nick through the window from inside his apartment
He glances back and sees Charlie's "Members Only" coat hanging on a hook
When he turns back, Nick's taxi has disappeared
The brightest object in the frame is a yellow forklift carrying a jostling aluminum coffin toward the open belly of the cargo plane
Nick watches it from the edge of the tarmac
Nick hands the clerk his ticket
Smoking
Aisle or window
Nick spots a folded newspaper someone has left on the counter
He can't read it, of course, but there's a picture of the subway platform where Charlie was killed, swarming with police
Nick continues to stare at the paper
Aisle or window, sir
(looks up) want to cash it in
Yen
: '  - Nick steps in, drops the two suitcases
Ichiro
The woman steps out of the kitchen, babbles something in Japanese
Nick doesn't have a clue
: - Only a handful of patrons
Joyce is straightening bottles behind the bar
(
) What's tricks
She looks up, surprised to see Nick standing in front of her
Ich said you left
There was a change in plans
Beat
'm sorry about your friend
Nick's surprised at how fast she heard
Dead gaiijin's are big news
Gaiijin
An outside person
foreigner barbarian
You, me
(beat) More you
could use some help
Show me around
'll pay you for your time
don't give tours
Nick smiles
You can count on the truth from people who don't like you
You have a helluva way of asking for help
You have a helluva way of answering
Draw
Look, you need Ich
've been here five years and  still can't read all the street signs
Maybe 'm a quicker learner
don't think so
From  : (
) Nicklaus-san
Nick turns to see Ich, leaning against the door frame
He's already had a few drinks too many
He's delighted to see Nick
've continued working on the case
can see that
Ich ambles into the room, slips down into a chair
He spills the contents of the large manila envelope he's been carrying onto the table:  a wallet, a set of keys, playing cards, etc
(signaling to Joyce) Joyce
drink please
(to Nick) Kobo has disappeared
My superiors don't trust me
Nick walks over to the table and looks at the items
Kobo's
Taken off him when he was arrested in New York
Nick sits down
Joyce gives Ich his scotch
knew you'd come back
You feel you have a debt you can never pay
But you will, even if it costs you your life
Giri
Honor
Nick picks up various items off the table
How'd you get this
stole them
Ich drapes his arm over Nick's shoulder
Partners, Nicklaus-san
Ich reaches for his drink
Nick gets there first
He holds it up as if he were proposing a toast, then purposefully spills his drink out
Partners
Ich has just had his last drink on duty
: - All the contents of the envelope are spread out on the table:  credit cards, matchbooks from New York City, choice clipping from Screw magazine, sugarless gum, cuff links
Nick's holding up a series of photos
of a naked women and Kobo screwing on a Tatami mat
Another photo
Then another
Each photo is more pornographic than the next
Joyce picks them up as Nick sets them down
Busy man
Nick holds out several of the same girl in various poses
Know her
(shaking his head) We can ask someone  used to work with
criminal
Someone  pay money to
snitch
: - The largest in Tokyo
Endless rows of men sitting in front of the machines (horizontal pinball games) furiously punching the flippers
The  from the metal balls is deafening
in a Hawaiian shirt, his arms covered with tattoos, is starting a new game
Ich moves up to the vacant machine beside him, puts in his change
Ich doesn't face the man as they speak in Japanese
The man in the Hawaiian shirt walks off
as the man in the Hawaiian shirt walks past him
This is the snitch
Nick glances back at Ich
Ich nods -- they're in business
: - We  the clattering of the machines outside
The man in the Hawaiian shirt, mid-fifties and badly in need of a shower, is sitting on the floor studying the photos
Ich and Nick tower above him
The man says something to Nick in Japanese, then continues to study the photos
What's he saying
(looking up) He says they're very nice
He wants to know if you have anymore
Nick sighs
'll ask him again
Ich asks in Japanese
The man shrugs
My turn
He grabs the man by his shirt collar and shoves him against the wall
The photos spill to the floor
Who is she
He bangs the man's head back against the wall
The man starts babbling in Japanese
Ich, horrified, tries to pull Nick off him
Nick, stop
Nick bangs the snitches head against the wall again
Ich gets Nick away
The man is terrified
This man must be treated with respect
Ich bows to the man, apologizes in Japanese
Aw, for Christ's sake
They continue speaking in Japanese
They bow to one another again
Ich gives the man a glass of water, then motions for him to sit down
Nick, impatient, starts for the guy again
Ich stops him
The snitch holds up one of the photos, and starts babbling
(to Ich) Now we're making progress
: - behind the cosmetic counter
She is wearing the store uniform:  blue and white dress and white gloves
doll
We shouldn't recognize her at first
Then -- one of Kobo's porno pics
It's the same face
holding the photo, standing in the crowded store
Ich is beside him
That's Kobo's girl
He's sure
Ich glances back at the man in the Hawaiian shirt standing by the door
The man nods
He's sure
They watch the girl help a customer choose an eyeliner
Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three days
He might not even be in Tokyo
Only one way to find out
Get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night
: - is struggling with his chopsticks and bowl of noodles
From
The sound stops, then starts again
Nick can't eat
He sets his bowl down and looks over at slurping his noodles
It is considered polite to slurp soba noodles as loud as possible
Ich stops
Looks at Nick, then resumes his slurping
Think you could keep it to a dull roar
They're sitting by the window across from the Seibu department store watching the entrance
It's good manners
Nick nods
Picks up his bowl
Again the  slurping off screen
Nick starts to eat the noodles
He can't continue with Ich slurping
He sets the bowl down
Ich grins, resumes slurping and we -- : -
The  are lined up at the door bowing and thanking the last customers for shopping in their store
Standard practice
The  whom Nick and Ich have been watching comes out wearing her uniform and heads down the street
waiting in the restaurant, get up to follow
: stepping out of the laundry carrying her wash
She walks past a doorway where
is standing
now walks past his partner picking up the tail
No acknowledgement between them
There are dozens of street cars waiting to pull out
The girl is on one of them
Ich has lost her
Nick and Ich hurry from car to car
You said you could keep up with her
'No problem, Nick-san
' (cutting Ich off) No
Don't say anything
Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize
Nick
Nick hurries toward another car to check it out
What'd  tell you
There she is
They spot the girl sitting in the window of one of the street cars, about to turn onto the main street
The two cops race for the car
Nick leaps on
Ich is a few steps behind
Nick sticks out his hand, pulls Ich up
They stand looking at one another, both breathing hard, both out of shape
: - Narrow streets with exploding neon ideograph signs as far as the eye can see
We spot our girl hurrying down the street
Nick, a half block behind, is bumping into people, trying not to lose her
She crosses the street and Ich picks her up
Nick drops off
around the corner the girl disappears into a three story apartment building above an electronics store
: '   - We're watching our girl inside her apartment
She flips off the  and climbs into bed
: - We've been watching the girl from a window across the street
It's a storeroom full of shipping crates, not much else
Ich is sitting on the floor, legs crossed, back erect, watching Nick
Nick glances over
Ich continues to watch him
Nick returns to the window
You dislike me
Nick keeps looking out the window
Did  say that
You toler -- yes, tolerate me
Are we getting married
Pause
'm a joke
They sent you to me to make a fool of you
Nick looks over at Ich
Ich is looking away
Nick looks out the window, then back at his partner
You're doing fine, Ich
Now drop it, okay
Sure
The girl switches off her light across the street
: - Ich is sleeping on his back looking like a grounded whale
Nick, exhausted, is sitting by the window his head resting against the sill
' as the girl, dressed in her store uniform, comes out of the apartment and heads for work
nudges the sleeping Ich with his foot
Ich opens his eyes
Let's book
Ich is groggy, nonplused
Let's go
: - ' Ich, tucking in his shirt, comes down the hall to see -- Nick, on his knees, examining the lock on the girl's apartment door
He slides his  card into the jam and lightly raps the knob plate
You can't do this
Nick uses his sleeve to wipe prints off the knob and jam
Call a cop
The door swings open
Nick walks in
: ' cheesebox with a few vintage pieces of American deco furniture
Ich, very uptight, stands at the door while Nick goes over the place
Nick opens the closet
It's packed with expensive dresses, pants, sweaters
Nick
(facing him) If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside
Nick goes through her chest of drawers:  on the top, a lot of high quality lingerie
:  The girl and Kobo posing in a vintage Corvette
Nick replaces the picture, and carefully rearranges the drawer so it appears untouched
He pulls open another drawer
Then another
Under the jeans and Mickey Mouse -shirts, he finds: in hundreds
The bottom of the drawer is lined with stacks
Nick holds them up for Ich to see
Not too shabby for a perfume pusher
Ich, shocked, tries to play it cool
Too bad it's not in yen
Nick shoves the drawer shut
: -  - The  buys fruit from a stand as  watches from one end of the block; , listening to his transistor radio, waits at the other
suddenly turns and finds herself facing a few yards away
Nick smiles, then walks into the store, hoping he hasn't been made
: '  - Rain pours down
- Nick, leaning against the wall, watches the girl's apartment across the street
The girl walks in, turns on her light, then disappears into the bathroom
Ich walks in, exhausted, soaked to the skin
He tosses his cap in the corner
Struck out again
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry
Fabulous
(looking back out the window) Four goddamn days
This is going nowhere
at the door
(
) It's me
Ich opens the door
Joyce, dressed for work, is carrying two odons (box dinners)
Joyce and Ich exchange greetings in Japanese
What's the latest
Nick shrugs
We'll get him, Joyce
Joyce peeks out the window
The girl is getting undressed
She ever pull down her shades
(right back at her) Sure, but then  just pull out the photos
Ich opens one of the box dinners and sets it on the ledge in front of Nick
(enthusiastically) Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki -- Ichiro -- (realizing) Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue -- Smells like Bayonne at low tide
Joyce hands Ich a flask of hot sake in tinfoil
Whoa whoa
Nick grabs the flask
Dumps it out the window
Don't be an ass
He's on duty
paid for that
Nick tosses a few thousand yen on the table
Then, spotting something out the window
Alley oop
Nick grabs his coat and goes out the door
Joyce slips Ich another flask of sake
: -   - It's our  standing alone on the corner of the street but you wouldn't know it at first
She's wearing tight leather pants, red leather jacket, earrings, bright red lipstick, and she's dumped the pony-tail, allowing her hair to fall to her waist
watching in a doorway down the block
Nick's shivering, his hands thrust in his army surplus jacket
Ich doesn't mind the cold
He's had his sake
riding their bikes come around the corner drive past her, then circle back
One of the  stops to talk to her, then drives off
She hurries off in the opposite direction
Yakuza
Good
Very good
: The girl waits until the last minute, then after glancing back, steps in the car
The train pulls out
The cars race past until we see -- Nick and Ich standing inside of the last car
It disappears into the tunnel
: - The girl, on the move, pushing through the crowd
Drop back to find Ich twenty yards behind
She crosses the street
Nick, pretending to be looking in a store window, picks her up
Nick has lost her
It's a cul de sac with a dozen buildings
He's standing in the middle of the street
Ich catches up to him
She disappeared
shit
You were too far behind
Nick does a double-take
(recalling Nick's words) Don't say anything more
Don't do anything
And, for Christ's sake, don't apologize
: -   -  - dropping another cigarette butt to the ground
There's a small pile at his feet
He's leaning against the wall watching one end of the block
over to reveal Ich, his back to Nick's, watching the other end
Ich glances back at Nick
Nick ignores him
Ich turns back
Nicklaus-san
Nick turns to see the  walk out of a bath house
She's wearing her ponytail again, with a black dress
She climbs into a taxi
: - The girl climbs out of the taxi and goes inside
Nick and Ich are watching from across the street
Packed with Salarymen from the nearby brewery and hostesses in silk dresses selling cheap champagne at expensive prices
Walk in
Everything seems normal
The  in a white tux, stops them
This is not a place frequented by Gaiijin
Ich beseeches the Bouncer to let his good friend in, promising that his friend will spend lots of money
Nick, thinking he's in, takes a step forward
The Bouncer shoves him back
Hey, no hands, huh
He bats his hands away
Ich grabs Nick by the shoulders, preventing a fight
You can't come in
They don't want -- Gaiijin
'll check it out
Nick, unsure, turns to go, but before he does: If  smell one drop of Scotch on your breath, my friend -- You can trust me
Nick hesitates, he's not so sure, then shoves the door open
Nick waiting under the pink neon sign
- Ich is sitting at the crowded bar
has her arm around his neck
He checks out the room, searching for the girl
He notices two  standing outside a sliding door
Ich finishes his drink
(in Japanese) Let me up
(shoving him down) Sit, sweetie
(to bartender) Another Seagrams
Ich relents
Then, spotting something across the room: :   rice paper door slides open, momentarily revealing a  men with close cropped hair sitting on tatami mats, playing poker
Some have their coats off, revealing arms covered with tattoos
Yakuza
hostess, serving drinks, steps but leaving the door partially open
The hostess slides the door open to the adjacent room, but Ich  see inside
She slides it shut
Ich's hostess wants him to buy another drink, but Ich shakes his head, gets to his feet, and pretending to be drunk, stumbles toward the sliding doors
Ich bumps into a table; slaps a stranger on the shoulder; then starts singing along with Frank Sinatra on the stereo
He's a little too loud, a little off key
The bodyguards eye Ich suspiciously
He stumbles past them, then grabs the sliding door and yanks it open
low table
Kobo is at one end
An older, distinguished, sliver-haired man in his seventies whom we will come to know as  is at the other
Ich can't believe his eyes:  Sugai is the head of the largest Yakuza syndicate in Japan
half dozen  sit on either side of the table
Half are older, dressed in conservative suits; the other half are younger wearing $700 Issy Miyake jackets
are having a heated discussion
The  Ich and Nick have been following walks over to Kobo and sits beside him
This makes Sugai even more irate
He's on his feet, red faced and screaming
seeing Ich, pull out their Beretta's
Two more grab him and fling him head first against the wall
(drunken, in Japanese) have to piss, gentlemen
'm so sorry but  have to -- The bodyguards hurry him towards the door
Nick checks his watch, it's been an hour - where the hell is Ich
Ich comes stumbling up the steps, still affecting his drunken, pigeon-toed walk
Nick, of course, thinks Ich has gotten drunk again
Two of the bodyguards are watching from inside
don't believe it
(grabs him) Son-of-a-bitch -- Ich, knowing they're being watched, grabs Nick by the sleeve and drags him off still pretending to be drunk
(under his breath) 'm not drunk
We're through
mean it
This is the end of the line, Matsumoto
Nick -- Shut-up
No longer fearing he's being watched, Ich abruptly stops his affected walk, and sounding very sober -- You shut-up
(then) Kobo is inside
He's with Sugai, the head of the Summaguchi-clan
Ich is dialing on the police call box as he fills Nick in on Sugai
Godfather
His man was killed at the printing plant
want to yank Kobo
Not without a small army, Nicklaus- san
Ich quickly speaks on the police phone, then hangs up, pleased with himself
Ich, my name is Nick
Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san
Nick
San is an honorable title
Ich realizes it's better to drop it
: - Drunken Salarymen spill out the door
are standing across the street waiting for the cops to arrive
Nick freezes
they've been following steps out and lights a cigarette
She looks up and spots the two men through the traffic
Nick turns away, afraid he's been made
When he looks back, she's gone back inside
Shit
Nick races across the street toward the club
Horns (doesn't understand) Nick
Nick reaches the curb just as the front doors to the club He's too late
Three bodyguards burst out, checking the street
red and white Debonnaire pulls up
Sugai, surrounded by a half-dozen additional bodyguards, comes out and slips into the car
It tears off down the street
from either end of the street peel around the corner
It's a madhouse
The remaining lieutenants and bodyguards fan out, trying to elude arrest
Nick hurries down the steps
The patrons are still in place, but the two side rooms are empty
Nick spots  going out the rear entrance
He starts after him but is confronted by the bouncer who stopped him earlier
Nick connects to the guy's jaw before his adversary can raise his hands
The bouncer staggers back
Nick flies out the rear door
: - Several lieutenants and bodyguards toss their guns -- possession is a felony in Japan -- as the police close in
- Ich hurries in, but Nick's long gone
-   - The narrow streets are deserted
Nick slowly makes his way down the street
The  of a
Nick ducks for cover -- it's a car
He continues on
Nick's  of a woman giving a man a blow-job in a narrow alley
The man's face is hidden by the shadow
Nick continues on
(  ) People like Charlie are a dime a dozen
Nick turns back to see Kobo as he steps into the light
Kobo tosses a handful of change at Nick
Keep the change
'm taking you back
The girl takes off down the block
Here  am
From across the street, a dozen bodyguards appear from various doorways and alleys
Charlie was a rookie
Kobo traces his finger across the spot where he cut Nick in New York
But you can take care of yourself
You're 'the biggest thing to hit this town since Godzilla
' Nick glances at the guards, then back at Kobo
He is unarmed
To make a move would be suicide
More in the b
g
closing in
What's the matter
'm right in front of you, Nick
(takes a step closer) But  was right in front of you when you let Charlie die
Kobo takes a step forward
His face is inches from Nick's
Walk away again
Maybe you'll get used to it
Nick doesn't budge
, then
Nick turns and slowly walk off
After a dozen yards Nick looks back
The street is empty, except for a street sweeper pushing his wet broom down the block
- half dozen bodyguards are being frisked, then shoved into police cars
Ohashi is talking to the enraged nightclub owner
Nick steps up to him
Ich hurries over
Nick
(to Ohashi) few minutes faster, we might've nailed him
Ohashi doesn't say a word, hands Nick a document
What's this
Your visa has expired
Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch
Look
Ohashi directs Nick's attention across the street where a is parked
The rear doors are open revealing a van full of surveillance equipment and cops
You ruined an on-going investigation that could have gotten us more than one runner
(to Ich, in Japanese) want a full report in the morning, officer
Ich bows as Ohashi walks off
Maybe if you'd work with us -- Ohashi ignores him, continues walking toward his waiting car
(shouting) Hey
(Ohashi keeps walking) , '   ,
(his back toward Nick) Twenty-four hours, detective
Ohashi slips into his car
Nick storms up to the car and slams his fist on the window
Ohashi
Ohashi faces straight ahead, ignoring Nick
Nick takes the extradition paper and spikes it on the car antenna
Ich grabs Nick by his arm, pulling him back from the car
The car pulls away
Nick, stop
Nick whirls, and before he realizes what he's doing, punches Ich below his left eye
Ich stumbles back over the curb and lands on his ass
Damnit, Ichiro, 'm tired of people telling me what  can and can't do
No one ever solved anything sitting on their ass
Nick, beside himself with frustration, watches Ohashi's car disappear down the block
looking up at who walks off without looking back at his partner
: '  - Nick, standing beside the tub, dumps a pail of hot water over his head, rinsing himself off
He grabs a towel and walks out of the room
' Ich, holding an ice pack to his face, is lying on a tatami mat against the wall looking up at the ceiling
An open bottle of Seagrams beside him
Nick stretches out on another tatami on the opposite side of the room and looks up at the ceiling, too
The ice help
Nothing from Ich
Where does this Sugai live
(cold) resort city, Beppu
want to go talk to him
What
Why
Because he knows how to get to our man
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin
'll be a nice Gaiijin
Nick gets up and goes to the closet
He slides open the door
All of his and Charlie's clothes have been neatly hung up
He shoves Charlie's jacket aside
Something's wrong with the way it hangs
He pulls the jacket out, runs his hand over the coat, feeling something heavy in the lining
Nick rips the lining open
Charlie's
32 Beretta and a spare clip tumble out
The little bastard
God bless him
Ich takes a drink from his bottle
It's very small
Big enough
It's illegal, Nick
It's a new deal
(putting it in his waist band) coming with me tomorrow
Sugai's not going to be impressed with your gun, Nick
(beat) No
won't put myself in danger for you anymore
Nick picks up the liquor cap which rolled across the floor
He tosses it to Ich
Ich reaches for it, but misses
Sure, pal
You've got better things to do
Nick walks out shutting the door behind him
Stay on Ich watching the door, then -- : - The last customers find their way to the street, some with a little encouragement from a
Joyce steps out
Nick comes up to her
You know where  can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night
'm buying
Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice
Joyce takes off down the street
Nick watches her for a beat
need your help, Joyce
Where's Ich
Unavailable
: - On the stage, a young professional looking man is singing along to "" blasting from the stereo
The Japanese way of letting it all hang out
We find Joyce and Nick at a corner table having a drink
've heard of Sugai
've also heard of the emperor
They're both national treasures
One's a hood
need someone to translate for me
My Japanese isn't that hot
Besides, you'll never get in
It's my last shot
have to be on a plane home tomorrow night
And 'm supposed to care
You could fake it
Joyce finishes her drink, sets it down
: - The neon flickers on the rain slicked pavement
Nick and Joyce walk down the deserted street
She's carrying an umbrella
You're wrong to sell Ich short
He drinks
He's got a reason
Nick shrugs, everyone's got a reason
His son hooked up with some bikers
Yakuza kids
cop shot him running from a robbery
Nick looks over for the first time
father doesn't out live that kind of thing here, much less a police officer
Pause
Where's the wife
You met her
Nick looks surprised
The woman in the apartment
She won't speak to him
But she won't leave either
Japan
Nice, huh
Before Nick can respond, something catches his eye:  What he sees -- partially shadowed, standing in the alley
Nick grabs his gun
The man steps out zipping up his trousers
It's a drunken Salaryman
Nick lowers his gun
The Salaryman staggers down the street singing to himself
Not wound too tight
: '   - three story modern building on a quiet street
She's searching for her keys
'd invite you up but  know you'd hate the incense
(as if to explain) chant
What do you chant
'Nam oyo ranged kyo
'  You think it's dumb of course
Not if it works
(holding the door open for her) 'll meet you at the train
don't remember saying yes
don't remember you saying no
Joyce smiles, heads inside
: '  - Ich is sleeping
Nick slips into his leather motorcycle jacket
He drops Charlie's gun into his pocket
He glances down at Ich, seeing if he's awake
He's not
Nick walks out
Ich opens his eyes
He's been awake the whole time
: - Ich, wearing a blue suit, is pouring water over a simple stone with a wooden dipper
Next, he places incense in a holder and folds his hands in prayer
The photo on the stone is of a young man wearing a school uniform
Ich's son
: - It's bull's-eye nose cone scuds across the endless rice paddies west of Tokyo
Women in straw hats stand in the knee deep water pruning the rice by hand
Old Japan rubbing shoulders with the new
- looking out the window as the countryside shoots past at 140 mph
From
several children chanting:  "Harrow, Harrow
" Nick looks over to see three uniformed school children thrusting their notebooks and pens at him
is sitting across from Nick
They want your autograph
Who am  supposed to be
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford
the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson
Tell them 'm not
She does, but the kids insist
They'll never go away
Nick, reluctantly signs
Joyce takes one of the kid's notebooks before passing it back
Mick Jagger
Joyce smiles, surprised at his choice
Then, she looks up shocked to see -- carrying a gift wrapped package under his arm
He's wearing his hat, blue suit and tie
Ich sits  the aisle from Nick and Joyce
He doesn't say a word
Faces straight ahead
Nick looks at Joyce, then back at Ich
'm sorry, Ichiro
lost it last night
shouldn't have hit you
Still nothing from Ich
What's in the box
(still not facing him) For Sugai
Caviar, French cheese, ham
If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you
So  bring some cheese
Gifts are expected here
Nick nods, looks back out the window
He'll never understand this country
He looks back to see -- Joyce looking annoyed at him
Nick gets the message
Hey, Ich
Thanks
'm glad you're here
mean it
Ich still won't acknowledge Nick
The Bullet Train disappearing into the foothills
- Plumes of white steam spindle skyward from every street corner
If you didn't know it was steam, you'd think the city was on fire
Beppu is a resort famous for it's geothermal baths
' The only traditional house we'll see in our story
It's surrounded by a pool of blood red steaming water from the hot springs
1000 yen bill as it is dropped on the ground
pair of dice rolls over it
handful of  wearing suits and ties are playing craps
Ich is sitting on the ground leaning against the wall, sound asleep
Nick is standing nearby
He checks his watch
Tired of waiting, he walks over to -- reading the Manichi Daily
(impatiently) They took the gift an hour ago
The phone rings inside the gate
guard picks it up
(certain it's bad news) All's not lost
There's a famous temple here
We could chant
The guard hangs up, calls out to Joyce
Joyce responds in Japanese
The guard opens the gate
We're in
The cheese
' vast, austere, traditional room with sliding rice paper doors and tatami mats on the floor
Ich and Joyce, drinking tea, are sitting with their feet beneath them in the traditional manor
Nick, smoking, is in a semi-sprawl; using his tea cup as an ashtray
enters
He says something and beckons
They all rise
He says something else
(to Nick) Just you
- ' Nick enters, ducking his head in the low doorway
the shoji slides shut behind him
The furnishings are minimal but elegant
There's a butsudan, a tokonoma, and a low, long table in the middle of the room
No chairs
Nick sits on the floor
door slides open at the far end of the room
Sugai, wearing a kimono over western style suit, walks in
Nick stands up to shake his hand
Sugai ignores it, and sits in the traditional position:  feet tucked beneath him
'll spare you the ritual
He tosses him a palm sized bundle
Nick catches it
Inside, are brand new greenbacks:  hundreds
This supposed to impress me
He sets it down
Pick it up
Look at it
Nick hesitates, then picks it up again
He runs his fingers over the face of the bill and snaps the paper
Seven years work by the finest engraver
Mass produced, sequentially numbered
The best there has ever been, Mr
Conklin
'm impressed
But let's use the short form
'm looking for -- -- Kobo
know
He killed two of my partners
One in New York, one at the printing plant
Sugai fills a cup of tea for Nick and hands it to him
don't drink tea
Sugai hands it to him anyway
took Kobo from the street
gave him a home, a future
But my ways were too slow for him
served seven years in prison for my boss when  was a young man
Kobo wouldn't serve seven minutes for his Oyabun
(sipping his tea) He was supposed to take over this syndicate when  retired
want him
He'll be dealt with
Sugai sets a plastic wrapped object on a table before Nick
Nick recognizes it from the restaurant massacre in New York
:  Nick's fingers tear at the plastic
block of black iridescent polymer
The negative image of a $100
00 bill
printing plate
Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us
The families who control the casinos
Yes
Unlike our syndicates, your criminals don't understand the words 'honor' and 'duty'
We can't afford not to deal with them
Sugai takes the plate back
Imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar
The Feds would be onto you in a month
Not with these bills
And even if it only took them six months, do you know what our profit margin would be
Nick looks at a child playing near one of the hot pools in Sugai's garden
Why tell me this
The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man
Find it for me
You trust me
'll pay you
Nick laughs at Sugai's audaciousness
(indicating the counterfeit bills) With these
Swiss bank deposit
Gold bullion
Whatever you want
You know the city and the police
If  say no
You're smarter than Kobo
You know the price of deceit
Think about it
don't have to
Sugai cools
Without a word he gets to his feet and starts toward the door
have ten hours to grab my man
still walking with his back to Nick
(
) You won't get hurt
Sugai turns to see Nick, across the room, pointing the Beretta at his head
: - '  - The room where Ich and Joyce are waiting
Sugai enters
Their surprise turns to shock when they see Nick behind him holding a gun to the old man's head
No
Let's go
Him first
Nick, you can't do this
It's done
(to Joyce) You don't have to come
She hasn't moved a muscle
'  - Sugai watches calmly as Nick, Ich, and Joyce put their shoes on
Nick keeps the gun on him
: ' Nick steps out of the house
He now has one end of a wire coat hanger loosely wrapped around Sugai's neck, the other end around his wrist
His gun is pressed just beneath Sugai's ear
If nick gets shot, so does Sugai
handful of guards stand in the courtyard, one is polishing Sugai's Debonnaire car
They spot Nick and Sugai coming, and immediately pull their guns
Explain to them
They shoot me, they kill you
(Sugai hesitates) Sugai explains to his lieutenants
They stand helpless as Nick walks Sugai toward the car
Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside
No
Not now, man, okay, not now
Work with me
Ich takes the keys from the man polishing the car
He gets inside
Joyce hurries in bedside him
You don't know what you're doing
Nick slides Sugai in the back seat, carefully reaches over and shuts the door
Start it
(terrified) can't
Slide over
Joyce, furious at Nick, starts the car, gets behind the wheel
Ich gets in on the other side
She spins the car around
The gate opens
They tear off
: -  - The car bursts through the funnels of steam from the hot- springs beneath the street
It tears down the narrow block dodging traffic
Joyce is concentrating hard on the road
(to Ich) Where's somewhere safe
Nothing from Ich
He's still apoplectic
(angrily) You came up with the first part
: - four story concrete hotel, strictly for making love
"Love Hotels" exist all over Japan
Each have various themes:  western, fifties drive in, Star Wars, etc
, each complete with music and lighting effects
Western style
Plastic five foot cacti in front of the western vista on the walls
hitching post at the head of the bed
Cowboy hats and boots at the other end
Sugai hangs up the phone and turns to Nick and Joyce who are sitting nearby
Ich hangs up the extension
Kobo will meet me here tomorrow
Ten a
m
Ich nods, confirming that what Sugai says is true
Good
He'll find out you took me
'm unprotected
He'll kill us
All of us
You don't stand a chance
Ich, knowing Sugai is right, looks at Nick
Nick flips Ich the gun
Not if we're careful
Ich checks to make sure the gun is loaded, then watches as Nick escorts Joyce out of the room
: Fifties theme
The front end of a pink chevy curves around the bed
"Drive-In" movie screen along one wall
Nick is dropping change into the vintage Wurlitzer
Joyce steps in, leaving the door open
You're out of your mind
'm leaving
Nick doesn't respond
You'll get Ich killed
No one's keeping him here
Bullshit, Nick
And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie
It's not
Why would you care
That pushes her over the line
Bastard
She moves toward him, enraged
Nick grabs her arm
Let go
He won't
You're out of your mind
He grips her tighter
: - Nick and Joyce, only partially undressed, are making love on the floor
The Drifters singing "Under The Boardwalk" can be heard on the Wurlitzer
The fifties decor, the music, it's all pretty incongruous
: - Nick is putting Joyce in a taxi
He shuts the door
still think you're a bastard
What if  chant
Wouldn't help
(beat) Watch out for Ich
He nods
The cab drives off
Nick watches her taxi until it is out of sight, around a corner, then heads inside
: - walking into Sugai's room
Sugai's asleep on the bed
Ich is vigilantly sitting awake in the corner, the gun resting on the table in front of him
Better wake him up
: - Quiet
The wind twirls a discarded newspaper in the parking lot
- step out of a door, arm in arm, and disappear down the hall
from one room
from another
the closed elevator door
It opens, Kobo steps out, followed by a half-dozen more men all carrying Sig-Saur assault rifles -- very heavy artillery
: wearing his hat and coat is sitting on the couch, his back to us, facing out the window
Drop down to -- couple are making love in the Hawaiian theme room
The door burst open
Two men, cradling Sig-Saur rifles in their arms, step in
They aim at the ceiling, blasting into Sugai's room above
starts screaming
The men ignore her and continue to pump bullets into the ceiling
stop in front of every door long enough to blast into the room
They make their way down the hall
naked man steps into the hallway and is matter-of-factly gunned down
Kobo and his men stop in front of Sugai's room
' Sugai, wearing his hat, is slumped down on the couch which has been splintered by the bullets from below
Kobo signals the men
All six open-up through the door
The door, what's left of it, is kicked open
The six men step in, shooting in all directions:  into the bathroom door, into the closet
Windows shatter, mirrors fall, total destruction
They stop
Kobo walks up to Sugai who is slumped on the couch
He lifts up his hat
It's a cowboy mannequin wearing Sugai's clothes
opens
of Sugai's men carrying machine pistols come out
Nick and Ich lie on their bellies, guns out
Kobo's men turn
Sugai's men open-up
Three of Kobo's hitters go down
The others try to flee into the adjoining room
Kobo goes for the balcony
as Kobo steps out
He steps right into -- who slams the side of Kobo's head with the butt of his gun
Nick and Ich drag Kobo in by his jacket collar
Sugai, very much alive, walks in from the hallway
Nothing is said
Sugai looks at Kobo for a long beat, then walks out
: '  - standing alone in the middle of a tatami room
His face is badly beaten
His hands are bound
Two guards stand near the wall
Nick and Ich stand across the room
wearing a western suit, is asking Kobo questions in Japanese
Sugai barks at him again
Kobo refuses to answer
Sugai pulls up a shuto -- an 18 inch knife -- from it's scabbard
(in Japanese) Contact your associate in New York and tell him to hand my plate over to Abolofia
Nothing from Kobo
You have betrayed the syndicate and personally dishonored me
would rather the deal fell through than
The guards walk over and turn Kobo around
His back is to Sugai
Sugai runs the sword across the nape of Kobo's neck drawing blood
The guards tighten their grip on Kobo's arms
can't believe Sugai's going to kill him
Nick starts to get up, Ich stops him
Kobo realizes Sugai isn't just threatening him
No
'll arrange it
: - Kobo is led back into the room by two guards
The guards shove him down to the floor
His hands are still bound
Nick walks over and stands above him
He doesn't say a word
Just stands above him
Then, Nick pulls spare change from his pocket and slowly drops the coins, one by one, in front of Kobo's face, like Kobo did to him
He walks away
Sugai steps in
Abolofia's person has received the plate
It's done
door opens at the far end of the room
It's Kobo's girlfriend, the one Nick and Ich had been following
She starts toward Kobo; a lieutenant intercepts her
(in Japanese) wanted you to see him like this
(in Japanese) Let him go, father
realizing she's Sugai's daughter
(in Japanese) You're too old
(in Japanese) That's enough
Sugai turns away and picks up the sword
The guards clutch Kobo
Sugai's going to kill Kobo after all
The girl screams at him to stop
Sugai's oblivious
(
) That wasn't our deal
You want him dead too
After a court convicts him
He belongs to me
There's a long pause
Then, something unusual happens
Sugai tells the lieutenant to unfasten Kobo's wrist
When he does, Sugai hands Kobo the sword and demands that he cut off his finger
This is Yubitsume:  the ritual act within the Yakuza of slicing the joint of the little finger to atone for a mistake
Kobo, not believing in this ancient tradition, refuses
Sugai nods to a guard who places Kobo's finger on the table
stares defiantly at Sugai
He doesn't even wince as the blade slices off his finger
The guard hands Sugai the finger in a handkerchief
(looking at Nick) If anything happens to Abolofia or my plate, detective
on Nick then -- : - as it bursts out of a tunnel on it's way to Tokyo
- Kobo is sitting by the window, his hands cuffed in front of him
Another pair of cuffs chain him to the arm rest
Nick pours a drink from an airline-sized bottle of Scotch
He holds it out to
Ich
It's his first drink in a week
Just one, compadre
Kampai
Kampai
They clink glasses
Ich drinks it down
It took 12 years to make it, you could take five minutes to drink it
Ich slows down
You did great, Ichiro
called Ohashi, he'll be waiting
(smiling) like him waiting
Ich gets up
Needs ice
He heads for the bar car, leaving Kobo and Nick alone
Kobo looks out the window at the people working the rice paddies, then back down the aisle at the Salarymen in their identical suits, then at the women separated from them
Ugly
couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules
Looking in
Always afraid
Ugly little lives
Save it,  already took the tour
You are a lucky man
Where you come from a man can stand out
It's expected
Here a man is made to look a fool for standing out
Nick isn't paying much attention
like your friend, Joyce
You're lucky
Guess 'm on a roll
She's such a long way home for you
Time, 've got plenty of
raucous  comes down the aisle, singing an Enka, swaying with the train, bumping into seats
common enough sight and ignored by the rest of the passengers
The Salaryman stumbles and falls across Nick's lap
(helping him up) Hey, hey, come on, blow
The Salaryman bows deep
Nick ignores it
The man moves on
Kobo looks out the window, the train begins to as it approaches the next station
(matter-of-factly) This is my stop
'm amused
Don't be
Nick looks up to see Kobo calmly fingering a lock of blond hair tied with black ribbon
Joyce's ribbon
Joyce's hair
have her
Nick looks down the car
The drunk Salaryman who stumbled over Nick is quite sober
He made the hand-off to Kobo
Kobo holds out his wrists
Nick hesitates
(matter-of-factly) 'll kill her
Nick, reluctantly, unlocks both sets of cuffs
The train pulls into the station
want the plate from your pal, Sugai
When you get it, you get her
Kobo gets up, starts down the aisle
Sugai won't give it to me, you know that
Then take it from him
Kobo gets off the train
follows him to the door
Kobo get into a waiting Jaguar
Four guards nearby
Nick runs down the length of the car trying to keep the Jaguar in sight as the train pulls out
the car is gone
bursts into the packed bar car
Ichiro
Everyone turns around
No Ich
: -   - It slows into the station
Nick shoves past the passengers lined up in the vestibule, ignoring a conductor's angry shouts
- The train stops
Nick flies out and starts running, dodging the crowd
Three uniformed policemen, including Ohashi's assistant, hurry toward him; they're dismayed to find that Kobo is gone
Where's Ohashi
Instead of offering him help, the policemen grab him and slap a pair of handcuffs on Nick's wrists
What the hell are you doing
: - Nick, waiting alone in the cell
It's been hours
door at the end of the hall opens
Ohashi stops in front of his cell
Your plane leaves at six
Two officers will escort you
For God's sake, Ohashi,  need your help
Let me out of here
You had my help, detective
If anything happens to her while 'm here -- -- Do you know where she is, detective
Do you know how to find her
Even where to start
We will find them
have to get to Sugai
Goodbye, officer
Ohashi keeps walking
The  clank of metal on metal
Ohashi's gone
(yelling at the top of his lungs) on Nick, his fingers squeezing the bars in rage, then -- : - Flood rice paddies stretch to the distance on either side of the road
We  over to Kobo at a phone kiosk outside a gas station
(in Japanese) Yes
Do it
'  - Kobo's girl, Sugai's daughter, hangs up the phone
She's been on the other end of the line
' The door swings open
Sugai is sitting on the floor
The girl is carrying a tray of tea
Beneath the tray, we spot something else -- the butt of a short-bladed tanto
: -  - police car rolls through the service gate
We see Nick inside the car along with two police guards
- white room
No chairs
Jet engines can be through the walls
Nick is sitting on the floor, defeated
He doesn't look up when he hears someone enter
(
) 'll tell you one thing
You can't solve a thing sitting on your ass
Nick looks up
Ich is in uniform
revolver and batton hang from his white web gear
His undershirt bulges through his khaki shirt
He looks ridiculous
Nick has never seen a more beautiful sight
: Ich is driving
Nick is seated behind a cage in the back seat
His hands are cuffed
Ich is driving through the freight area towards a perimeter guard
was ready to have your ass for taking off on me
followed them
An hour from the train station
How many men
couldn't tell
Joyce
don't know
We need the plate to negotiate with
Ich nods
- The car slows
Ich speaks rapidly to the guard showing him his papers
The guard takes a good hard look at Nick
Time stands still
He waves them through
Nick can breath again
You know, Ichiro, you just burned your bridges
Ich is silent for a moment
He hands Nick's Beretta back through the partition
So it goes
Rest
Nick looks for Ich's eyes in the rearview mirror
The little cop keeps driving, his eyes on the road
: -  - Nick and Ich are standing outside their car
The Police radio crackles from inside
: large crowd gathered outside of Sugai's estate
Police have cordoned off the area
An empty ambulance is parked out front with various other cars:  Debonnaire's, Cadillac's
boy in shorts is endlessly bouncing a ball against the compound wall
Whatever happened is long over
Ich flips off the radio
Someone attacked him
Now we've got nothing to negotiate with
: - The police car streaks across endless fields
Nick is at the wheel
He rubs the sleep from his eyes
Ich is slumped down in the seat watching the road
Ich pulls out a cigarette
Nick lights it for him
Joyce told me about your family
It's tough
Ich looks up surprised
Thank you
(beat) You have one
wife
She left
'm sorry
Me too
Ich glances over at Nick, then back at the road
Nicks rubs out his cigarette and presses down on the accelerator
: '  - small, contemporary house perched on a dry piece of land
paved road, lined with dense foliage runs on a berm between the flooded rice paddies
sitting in the car watching from a hillside turnoff
There's no easy way in
Let's go
Ich hands Charlie his shuto -- an 18 inch long knife
What's that for
Luck
Nick tucks the shuto inside his jacket
Thanks
Nick opens up his door and climbs out
You know, Nick, we can't lose
(stopping) Why's that
Because we're the biggest things to hit this town since Godzilla
: leading to the house lined with foliage
The rice paddies on either side
: making their way through the waist high water
with their hoes make their way into the water
They don't see our cops
making their way along the edge of the road
The  of a motorcycle coming
slows and drops a gear as he turns off the main road and onto the dirt berm toward the house
He's one of Kobo's Bosozoku -- a long way from the streets of Tokyo
The rider comes around the bend to see -- standing in a uniform
Ich
For a moment he doesn't know what to do
Then, he draws a pistol from his belt and accelerates toward Ich
stands his ground as the bike closes in
The biker takes aim
Ich drops off to the side as -- rises from a ditch and swings a hoe at the rider as he passes, catching the man across the face
The rider drops like a swatted fly
The biker's momentum carries it a few yards before it falls and skids to a halt
Nick hurries to the bike
Ich drags the biker off the road, then catches up to his partner
raise the heavy bike
Nick mounts
He takes the riders helmet and goggles from Ich, and puts them on
What are you going to do
Nick doesn't know exactly
He taps the bike into gear, it torques like a mule
There's a lot more juice here than he's used to
Nick fishtails for a minute, then gets the hang of it
Ich heads off taking another route
' are putting the last of their belongings into a suitcase
She hands him the plate -- Sugai's plate
Kobo kisses her as he slips it into his breast pocket
The  of a motorcycle approaching from outside
Kobo steps out, and not recognizing Nick, raises his hand to greet what he thinks is one of his men
bearing down on Kobo
as Nick keeps coming
He is unable to see clearly until Nick is almost on top of him
dumps the bike at the foot of the stairs and leaps on Kobo
Nick and Kobo roll off the narrow porch
Nick breaks free
He isn't fighting fair this time
He slams his foot into Kobo's face and ribs
Kobo tries to get up, but Nick knees him in the chin
woman cries out in Japanese
Nick turns to see standing at the top of the steps
biker is pressing the muzzle of a Sig-Saur assault rifle on her
Kobo's girl is beside them holding a small pistol
gets to his feet
The biker tosses Kobo the rifle
Kobo works the charging lever and holds the weapon at his side
He has all the time in the world
Kobo whirls and kicks Nick in the groin
Nick falls to his knees in agony
Kobo towers above Nick as he did in the alley in New York
Still on your knees, Nick
Kobo walks off, his back to Nick
There's nothing you can do for me anymore
have the plate
Sugai's dead
No there is something
He walks up to the steps to Joyce
You can tell me who  should shoot first
Nick struggles to get to his feet
Kobo turns and faces Nick at the foot of the steps
appears behind Kobo and takes him down with an amazing display of baton work that shows a lifetime of training
He grabs the gun
biker bursts out of the door
Ich fires, hitting him in the thigh
He drops his gun
' grabs the gun
tackles her, and wrestles the gun away
She grabs for it
Nick slugs her
Ich is hit in the back of his shoulder, falls onto the porch
the shooter, is holding a pistol -- a Glock 17 automatic
He fires at who scramble for cover
continues firing as he climbs onto a motorcycle
He pops the clutch and flies off down the road
Nick fires after him, but Kobo's gone
(to Ich) You all right
Yes
(to Joyce) Call for help
Nick mounts the other bike, and puts the turbo charged rocket into gear
Rain pours down as Kobo turns onto the main road
He opens up the throttle, and in less than a second, he's a screaming dot in the distance
comes around the same corner
His bike fishtails and slides out from under him
Kobo tears past a police car
The police car takes off after him
series of steep switchbacks traverse the steep, densely forested hills
Kobo's bike flies up the road
The police car can't keep up, begins losing ground
going flat out, falling further and further behind
Kobo's going to escape
Nick, bent low, shoots past the cop car
His left arm is scraped and bloody
glancing back, to see Nick gaining on him
Kobo's pleased
He gives it more gas
pulling eight-five
ninety
one hundred
The rain stings his face
It's hard to keep his eye open
Kobo leaning into one of the steep turns, climbing higher and higher toward the clouds clinging to the top of the peak
is gaining on him
He  something coming up behind him
the one Ich shot in the leg, is closing fast on his tail
as the biker draws even
pulls out his long knife and slashes at Nick's shoulder
Nick drops back causing him to miss
The biker drops back
Nick tries to speed up, but the biker sticks with him
He's a good rider, this boy
Very, very good
The biker moves in again, blade drawn
something the biker doesn't
coming around the corner
swerves to avoid it at the last moment
The biker reacts too late and runs -- radiator of the two ton truck, and disappears beneath its wheels
around the bend, glancing back
Empty road
He eases up on the throttle -- a free man
He circles back only to see burst around the corner charging toward him at a hundred- and-twenty miles per hour, in the driving rain
waits and waits
Nick draws closer
Then, Kobo tears off back down the mountain, shooting past Nick
Nick brakes
He slows down, and starts to turn, but the wheels whirl on the gravel and the bike goes into a skid, heading right for the edge of the road
: ' flying over the edge of the road, and down the cliff
: Nick, lying on his stomach at the edge of the cliff, his arm is probably broken
He tries to get up with a one arm push up
It's hopeless
His head falls into a puddle of water
The  of an approaching motorcycle
Kobo has come back for him
Nick, in excruciating pain, struggles for his gun
bearing down on Nick
struggling to get his gun
Finally he does
But it's caked in mud
If the barrel is stuffed it will explode
Nick has to take the chance
Closer and closer
aims as best he can and fires
The mud caked gun explodes in his hand
Nick screams in agony
pulls his bike up inches in front of Nick's head
Nick seems to be bleeding everywhere:  his hand, his nose, his mouth, the side of his head
Kobo's face and neck is caked in blood from when Nick beat him
The rain pours down
He picks up the gun
Points it at Nick, squeezes the trigger
(slowly) Bang
bang
He tosses the gun in front of Nick's face
You're dead
The sound of approaching Police
Kobo swings the bike around, goes a hundred yards down the road, then swings back
Kobo guns the engine
He gain speed
thirty, thirty- five
struggles to get up
He can't
opening the throttle
crawling a few inches, that's it
twenty yards away
reaches into his coat and pulls Ich's 18 inch shuto out
He rolls away at the last moment, slashing Kobo's ankle as he races past
screams in pain
He tries to stop too suddenly
The bike flips over
Kobo flies into the air then hits the pavement on his side and rolls a few yards down the road
He stops on his back
It's lucky he's alive
The  of fast approaching police
has fallen out of Kobo's jacket
It rests in the road, halfway between the two men
crawls toward it on his belly
mustering all his strength, struggles across the road on all fours
crawling snake-like
still moving, his arms and legs feel like lead
' as they reach for the plate
grabs Kobo's wrist forcing him to drop the plate
Nick picks up a rock
It looks as if he's going to smash Kobo's head
Instead, he brings it down on the plate, shattering it in a half-dozen pieces
Nick tosses the pieces in front of Kobo's face
Keep the change
Nick, exhausted, slowly falls onto his back
He looks over at Kobo, their faces are inches apart
Nick makes a slashing mark with his index finger above his eyebrows
The same gesture Kobo made to Nick through the two-way mirror in New York
Nick passes out
His eyes shut
the screen
The  of three police cars screeching to a halt
The of the police  winding down
The  get softer mixing with the  of phones,  typewriters,
: Fifty identical desks
Fifty identically dressed men in white shirts and ties work under fluorescent lights
is at his desk studying a report
Suddenly, the lights go out
The fan's stop, so do the electric typewriters
Ohashi looks up to see -- walking toward him down the long aisle, his left arm is bandaged, his right hand handcuffed to Kobo on crutches
Ich silently leads the captured man down the long aisle to Ohashi's desk
stops in front of the desk and snaps to attention
Constable Ichiro Matsumoto presents captured prisoner Kobo, Chief Inspector Ohashi
Ich salutes
Inspector Ohashi will take charge of the prisoner
Ich uncuffs Kobo and steps aside to reveal -- standing at the far end of the room by the fuse box
He's also bandaged and on crutches
Nick looks at Ohashi without saying a word, then flips the main switch up
The lights and fans start working
He turns and walks out the door
: - small decoration ceremony
getting two golden suns pinned to the lapel of his dress uniform
In the far corner , Ichiro's wife, dressed in a formal kimono, watch the ceremony
: -  - Joyce and Nick are sitting alone at a table
Nick's left arm in in a sling
Can't make you change your mind
Last time you asked me to come along nearly got a hole in my head
Might be different in New York
Maybe
If  come visit, we can find out
'd like that
Ich sits down with two fresh bowls of soba noodles
Nick hesitates
You can do it
Nick picks up his chopsticks with his good hand
He begins to slurp the noodles
Louder, pal, louder
Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you
As Joyce refills all their cups we
: -    - It's raining
sun shower
Capt
Oliver is standing by the window watching the rain pour down
Remember, counterfeiting is the Feds
They'll be all over Abolofia's place
Stick tight
You
the other plate, he does real time
Right
Reveal Nick sitting in front of Oliver's desk, his one arm is still in a sling
Nick gets to his feet
(still not facing him) You know, Nick, if you'd held on to that plate, you could've been a very rich man
Oliver turns to face Nick
Nick just looks at him, then: Never crossed my mind
Oliver nods; he believes him
Be careful on the run
: - In contrast to the Japanese police station -- it's chaos
Cops are in every imaginable kind of dress, trash cans over flow, a handcuffed prisoner screams abuse to anyone who will listen
a dozen men in all, are donning flak jackets and windbreakers with  and  stenciled on the back
walks in with two heavy bullet proof vests slung over his shoulder
He squeezes past the raiding party to find sitting at a desk, thumbing through a Frommer's guide to New York City
Nick drops one of the vests on the desk
It lands like a ton of bricks
Ich continues to read
Sergeant walks in
Saddle up
Hard team in the first unit
Conklin, your  awaits
The cops and treasury men, grabbing their gear, head for the door
Nick is struggling to get into his vest using one arm
Sure you want to come
Probably better than the Greyline Tour
Ich stands up, shoves the guidebook in his back pocket
He helps Nick fasten the strap in back
You wouldn't make it without me
Nick smiles, takes the Frommer's out of Ich's pocket and tosses it into the trash
Nick hands him a shotgun, takes another one off the rack for himself
We watch from behind as the two men head down the long hallway toward the exit
Think we'll get him, Nick
We can't lose
How can you be so sure
Nick opens the door at the far end of the hallway
They step out into the sunlit rain
Cause you're the biggest thing to hit this town since
Before Nick can finish his line, the door behind them
