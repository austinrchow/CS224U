"Sleepy Hollow", early, by Andrew Kevin Walker Sleepy Hollow Being the true storie of one Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman Kevin Yagher and Andrew Kevin Walker Based on "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" by Washington Irving Screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker Third Draft 4/10/95 pleasing land of drowsy head it was, of dreams that wave before the half shut eye
-- An   charges through on a horse, holding a lantern forward on a long pole
He looks back, terrified
: 1799 Sleepy Hollow, New York are  behind
The ugly man glances back again
His lantern swings wild
against a tree
The jammed-up pole  the ugly man off his horse
He hits the ground
He runs, trips, falls and scrambles up
, we glimpse the source of the : a on a   , already gone
The ugly man pushes through thorny bushes
Jagged branches slit his hands and cheeks
He bursts from the briar patch and tumbles to a trail
He lifts his bloodied face
He runs
: the hooves of the black horse rip underbrush
spur digs into the snorting steed's already bleeding flank
The pursuer's gloved hand draws a , blade
, the ugly man runs on
The shrill  of a is  as the pursuer blurs past
The ugly man is still running when his head lolls back, at an impossible angle
tumbles off his shoulders
His headless body hits the dirt
-- Empty cobblestone streets
Crooked buildings breaks the silence from afar
: New York City clamor round a corner, lanterns held high, listening
They rush into an alleyway
, piers border the Hudson River
The  is The two constables arrive, searching
No one around
Constable One hefts his pistol, scared
Where are you
'  (o
s
) Here
Over here
They hurry to the river's edge
Down a hill, the , another constable, stands with his back to us
He's waist deep in water, tossing away his
need your help with this
Constable Two crosses on the peir above
Constable One moves forward, wary
The  grunts, lifting something
Constable Crane
Ichabod Crane
is that you
The  turns
Meet  , handsome, eyes piercing
Yes, it is me
But, not only me
(lifting, struggling) found someone here
He drags a bloated   up from the murky water
Someone quite dead
/ -- The elderly   lifts a blanket off the corpse on a wheelbarrow manned by Constable Two
snobby looks, disgusted
Constable One and Ichabod wait
Burn it
Yes, sir
Constable Two wheels the corpse inside
Ichabod's dismayed
Just a moment
if  may
It is possible this man was murdered
He drowned
Anyone could see
There are surgical ways of telling how he died
by the water in his lungs
Ichabod follows the High Constable and Magistrate in
,    -- Constable Two wheels the body ahead past many "booking" tables
moves to unlock a massive door
He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health
could determine if he were dead before he went into the Hudson
Must we again hear these heretical rantings
Yes, must we
There is nothing heretical about science, sir
The Chinese have written on it for hundreds of years
procedural study used to solve seemingly unsolvable crimes
The door is opened
The corpse again leads the way
,  -- two-tiered prison, alive with  of  and  of Cells are full of wretched men in chains and iron gags
Many are against the bars, watching
Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement
Have they nothing to fear presently
Without disrespect, look around you
(motioning to cells) We overflow
As do our courts
And, with disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure
But, how many innocents rot here
And, how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets
The High Constable reaches a desk, taking a seat
Guards wait to process beaten, bloody prisoners
Very few, if any
Even though  have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism
Not Liberalism
Equanimity
(to High Constable) Um, sir
might  suggest
The Magistrate  in the High Constable's ear
Ichabod notices with worry that Constables One and Two wheel the corpse onwards into another room
The Magistrate finishes
The High Constable smiles faintly
(to Ichabod) There is a farming community upstate, Constable
ten days journey north in the Hudson Highlands
It is named Sleepy Hollow
Within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there
Each with their head lopped cleanly off
(holds up papers) The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment,  have chosen you
Chosen me
These "methods" of yours
there has been no practical application
Not for lack of trying
Just so
Granted
And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place
Bring him here to face our good justice
Will you do this for me
(swallowing doubt) shall, gladly
Excellent
Then, you are excused till morning
Ichabod moves away, heading to where the corpse was taken
Oh, and, Constable
(off Ichabod's look) Do make certain that you meet with success
Otherwise
perhaps you should not come back at all
The High Constable smiles a sardonic smile
,   -- The corpse burns in a raging furnace
Flesh sizzles
Constable One pumps bellows which fan the flames
Ichabod steps from darkness nearby
He watches with bitter regret as the corpse is consumed
-- Market town streets bustle
Filthy
Pigs roam free
' ,   -- Decorated in Early-American Mad Scientist: books, papers and jars of chemicals
Charts of anatomy above a small bed
(o
s
) Such a day for such a sad farewell
But, this is goodbye, my sweet
At the window, Ichabod holds a bird cage with a red inside
He opens the cage
The bird flies free
Ichabod watches it go, then looks down
halts in the street below
The forlorn  looks up
'  -- In motion
Ichabod absently studies his hands, touching the strange  on both palms: evenly dispersed, tiny dots of tissue
Many scars
Ichabod lifts a  , checking its contents
-- of   travel a path, leading over- burdened horses
Ichabod's coach approaches from the other direction
Ichabod looks out, unnerved
One   watches Ichabod pass
There is a dead, worried look in the man's eyes
Others stare at Ichabod
,     -- Ichabod faces two massive, vine-covered , unsure
He turns to watch the driver lead the coach away
Ichabod walks between the pillars to a long straight road
He does not notice, above:    hang from a tree limb, twine wrapped round their necks
,   -- Ichabod walks on with baggage
The square is empty, a and  at one end
The road ahead is bordered by businesses and homes
from a tavern
criminal sits in stocks
quiet  is
Ichabod hears
He looks for its source
It's from a window above,
like the  of an
-- '
: a  stands tall, like a mast pole with a crow's nest basket atop
There's a man in the basket and a huge
Ichabod ponders this as he continues
Ahead on a hill: the grand Van Tassel Manor House
,   -- , in a circle, taunt a spun round by the handsome, barrel-chested man, few   and  watch
Brom releases the woman
Everyone quiets and avoids her searching hands
This is such a silly game
Be a sport and stop complaining
The woman moves to Brom's voice
He backs away, flanked by peers  and
Children laugh
Ichabod enters, clearing his throat
No one notices
The blindfolded woman keeps grasping
One   sees Ichabod and goes to him, finger to her lips
Play along
You must
She tugs him
Before Ichabod can protest, he is placed in the blindfolded woman's grip
There,  have someone
Am finished
You have to tell who it is
The woman touches Ichabod's face
He is uncomfortable, affected by this caress
Brom watches jealously
At least make a guess
don't know
Is it Brom Bones
Certainly not
Excuse me, Miss
(takes her hands) They have a laugh at your expense
She takes the kerchief off to reveal a stunning beauty: Ichabod tries to compose himself
Forgive me,  didn't know
am looking for Baltus Van Tassel
We haven't heard your name yet, friend
Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine
Brom grabs Ichabod's collar, pissed
Ichabod's baffled
You need some manners
Brom
Brom looks at her, then reluctantly releases Ichabod
'  (o
s
) What is this, then
, 45, has entered, a working-class aristocrat
, 40, stands behind, a mix of home-spun wife and well-kept lady
Can  help you, sir
Ichabod's relieved to have a proper focal point
Children gather around Katrina and hide behind her
have been sent from the city with a letter of introduction
am told you offer me room and board
Ichabod hands over papers
Baltus reads, furrows his brow
If we could speak alone
(nods, looks to Katrina) This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it
Am  mistaken
They're only children, father
Baltus snorts, then exits with Ichabod
The others huddle to gossip, except Katrina, who moves beside Lady Van Tassel to watch Ichabod and Baltus walk down the hall
,  -- , 50, dour and always sweaty, takes a seat by the fire, joining Baltus and three other elders
pretty servant, , brings a pipe cradle while Lady Van Tassel sets down food
Ichabod is standing
That will be all, ladies
(waits as they exit) We are joined by Doctor Thomas Lancaster, Constable
And to his left are, Clergyman Steenwyck and our able magistrate, Samuel Philipse, both keeping order in their own ways
is youngest, eyes bloodshot, mug in hand and pipe in mouth
is formidably built, wearing a constant look of disapproval
myself am in charge of financial matters and the regulation of currency in our commonwealth
And, lastly, this fine fellow is James Hardenbrook, our Notary
is oldest, ancient, with one eye pale and blind
An honor, gentlemen
In time will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now,  ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be
Excuse me
say, is there any one person suspect in these acts
was afraid of this
Philipse shoots a look to Baltus
Angst amongst the elders
Well, Constable
are you aware
to be honest, you are not what we expected
We sent for the militia
The militia
Why not tell us what you have heard
Hmm
How much have your superiors bothered to tell you
All  know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies
The heads were not found severed
The heads were not found at all
Withered Hardenbrook leans forward, his voice cragged
Taken
Taken by the Headless Horseman
Taken back to hell
Pardon me
You have not been well informed of our troubles, sir
If you would
Baltus gestures for Ichabod to sit
Baltus lights his pipe
The Horseman
he was a Hessian mercenary, sent to our shores by German princes to help keep Americans under the thumb of England
However, unlike his compatriots who came as muscle in trade for currency, he came willingly
For love of carnage
--   -- The   rides his black steed into a gory, close-quarters clash, his cloaked uniform adorned with edged weapons
He cuts down Americans left and right
(v
o
) He was infamous for taking his horse, Daredevil, hard into battle
chopping off heads at full gallop
He dismounts, hoisting a battle axe
With sword and axe, he annihilates
Blood gushes
Bones crack
(v
o
) Just to look on him made your blood run cold, for he had filed down his teeth to rapiers
to add to the ferocity of his appearance
The Horseman lets out a war cry
Jagged teeth
Grotesque
-- Winter
can be   from afar
Daredevil lies dead in red snow
away
(v
o
) He would not finally meet his end till the winter of seventy-nine, when New York City was held by Henry Clinton and Washington occupied West Point
It was between those two places, not far from here
The Horseman flees, cloak flowing, chased by  rag-tag Ahead, a steep, rocky area prevents escape
Soldier one aims a rifle and
Blood explodes from the Horseman's arm as he runs
His sword falls from his now functionless hand
Soldier Two grabs the sword
At the rocks, the Horseman faces the men
Another Rifleman raises his rifle
The Horseman reaches over his shoulder to grasp a sheathed knife,  -- The Rifleman jerks back, knife in his eye socket
The Horseman readies an axe
The Revolutionaries move in with swords
They battle,
The Horseman fends off blows from all sides
Soldier Three lunges, stabs his blade deep into the Horseman's side
The Horseman roars, brings his axe
the sword at the hilt
An  stroke sends Soldier Three head over heels in a fountain of blood
The Horseman staggers, howling, trying to pull the blade from his ribs
The remaining soldiers close in
,   -- Pipe smoke wafts from Philipse's mouth
Cut off his head with his own sword
It's a legend told for twenty years
But, only recently has the Headless Hessian been seen prowling the Hollow, in search of a head to suit his shoulders
Just a moment
(sits back, incredulous) Are you saying it is he
(aggravated, loud) When a goblin leaps from the nether world, others follow
Poltergeists of the air, water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations
Hardenbrook  his cane on a table
Baltus puts a calming hand on senile Hardenbrook's shoulder
No one knows why he chose to now to climb out from his grave
It is very clear why
Citizens here have long tried to hide sins behind closed doors
Their failed faith has saturated the soil and called forth one of Satan's own
Excuse me, gentlemen, but
who has seen this Horseman
Many have
Then, name one person who has seen him with their own eyes
long wait
No reply from the elders
Ichabod rises
While  will do everything  can to find your assassin,  will look for a man of flesh and blood
Not some goblin-demon from hell
-- The Belltower is covered in defensive spikes
man climbs down a rope ladder
Below, many   gather
Everyone grim
Philipse moves to the center, on horseback
Gather round
Gather and quiet
The hour has come to choose for this night
Each man's name is in this box and has been checked
box is handed up
Ichabod and Baltus arrive on foot at the back of the mob
Ichabod looks
At a nearby forest, men light   in a line bordering the forest edge for at least a half mile
Philipse draws a folded paper from the box, holds it up
May the Lord watch over him
(unfolds paper) "Jonathan Masbath
"  Are you here
(o
s
) am
take my responsibility
The crowd parts as  , a dirt-poor farmer with a bow and quiver of arrows, moves forward
His son, , 14, grips his arm
No, father
Wait
(up to Philipse) He's already been up once
Why does he go again
It is a lottery, son
It just as easily might have been one of them
Then
go with you
No
You obey my wishes
(looks to crowd) Brom
Look after him, will you
Brom steps up, nodding
Jonathan kisses his son's cheek, then heads to the rope ladder
Men pat him on the back
Someone leave him a horse
Young Masbath watches his father go
Brom coaxes him away
At the back of the crowd, Ichabod watches skeptically, looks to Young Masbath as he and Brom pass
You worry for naught, little man
Nothing will harm him there
(looks up, sotto) It is problems here on the ground you people need begin to worry about
Ichabod watches Jonathan climb, very high above
, '  -- Ichabod makes notations in a
(v
o
) You will dream
Katrina strolls in, sits on the bed
Ichabod is nervous
Did they tell
It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone
According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds
You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you
Feel free to form your own opinion
(facing his ledger) Though it appears you already have
Well,  intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems 've made matters worse
(getting up to go) 'll leave you to your business
Excuse me
should apologize
, um
have no great love of
Other people
Small talk
It might have been more
Might have been positively grand talk
Ichabod offers his chair, backing away
Seeing it is the only one, he remains standing
Katrina sits
Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women
Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat
My suitor
The massive fellow
Brom
For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy
He has proposed to me twice
Which may explain his temperament
To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once
Katrina looks down, discards this with a smile
've read a great deal about your New York City
Do be a dear and tell me all about it
Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life
Extra ordinary, yes
But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman
-- The torches burn bright
, in the Belltower, Jonathan Masbath loads a rifle
Jonathan stands, looking to a sky that is all stars and moon
is
Below, the horse tied at the base of the tower is spooked
is , ground rumbling
Jonathan grips a rifle, cocks it and moves to look
At the forest edge, a herd of deer stampedes out
They sprint past the tower and across the field
Jonathan crosses to watch the herd scatter
He crosses back to peer at the forest
Bad news
thick  creeps from the woods
As the fog overtakes the base of each torch, a tentacle of mist snakes up to the flame, killing it
All along the forest, arms of vapor snuff torches
one by one by one
Above, Jonathan sights the rifle along the trees
Come out, devil
come
, '  -- Ichabod leans on a dresser
Katrina's still seated
Not all think it is the Horseman
Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons
Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute
And, still others believe none of it
Are you so superstitious
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black
There is no such thing as magic
Really
Then
what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop
Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions
(laughs) You are funny
Ichabod doesn't get what's so funny about that
The of a  is
Katrina looks fearful
She goes to open a window
The
,  -- mournfully over farms and forests
-- as a  comes from his barn, listening, then sprinting towards his home
-- across the deserted square
Windows go dark
Shutters are slammed shut
-- Ichabod bounds out to the lawn, halting to listen
Katrina and Baltus come out on the porch
Constable, where are you going
then,
Ichabod chases away
Come back, sir
(watches him go) Madness
Baltus ushers Katrina back in
The door slams
-- Ichabod charges across the rocky field
He slows, awed
The Belltower is down, its mast is splintered
The horse is gone
Ichabod moves to where the crow's nest lies smashed
No sign of Jonathan
-- Jonathan runs past, gripping his bow
It's
till are  in pursuit
Trees are silhouetted against the sky
As  get , branches bend like arms and fingers yearning to touch
As   , the trees relax
, Jonathan runs
begins to
, in motion,   Daredevil's snorting visage; eyes lizard-like, with vertical slits literally aglow
The Horseman's hand yanks a wooden   from a saddle mount
(No clear view of the Horseman
) '
: closing in on Jonathan
Jonathan is overtaken
The Horseman swings the hammer -- sends Jonathan sprawling
Jonathan tries to get up, but pain shoots through him
He crawls to retrieve his bow
Against a tree, he takes an arrow from his shoulder quiver and readies it
Waiting
metal  is
Jonathan pulls the bow taut, pained, lips bloody
Elsewhere, Daredevil approaches slow
The Horseman taps his sword on his spur,
Foliage moves as the Horseman's form pushes through
Jonathan releases -- the arrow
-- imbeds in the Horseman's chest
continues -- Jonathan readies a second arrow
Pulls and releases --
Jonathan cries out, crawling away desperately
Crawling through underbrush, over roots and rocks
Jonathan gives up, spent, face to the dirt
He closes his eyes
Daredevil halts astride Jonathan; two legs on each side of Jonathan's body
-- Baltus and a large,   ride
Behind, Ichabod rides with Magistrate Philipse
Ichabod is not adept at riding his old nag, Gunpowder
The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants
And the Widow Windsor was next
And now Jonathan Masbath
(looks back, ponders) Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover
He would not have gone into the Western Woods
No sane man would
Philipse drinks from a whiskey flask, sees Ichabod watching and offers some
Ichabod declines
Van Ripper there
Ahead, the dullard,  , sloppily spits tobacco
found the body this morning
(pause) You do believe now, don't you
Believe
You said yourself
What mere man could have downed the Belltower
It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical
You need less big words, and more common sense
Philipse fingers an   talisman he wears on a cord
What is that you wear
My talisman
It will, protect against the Horseman if  show a brave face
But,  cannot run
If run in fear, it is worthless
Well
so much for common sense
,   -- Brom and Baltus stand at a '  amongst jagged boulders
The flesh has been stripped, guts exposed
Philipse and Ichabod arrive and dismount
Was this Jonathan's
Yes
Seems he panicked across here and broke two legs
Who took the meat
Must have been the Redman
Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods
These woods of yours sound a bit crowded, what with all the witches, ghouls and Indians living there
Brom climbs up onto his own horse, a black beauty
There's only one Lenape
He eats small animals and lost children
and the occasional constable when he can get it
Brom rides
Ichabod goes to the dead horse, digs in his satchel for a thin iron tool, which he uses it to pry off one is
Everyone looks far ahead to where Van Ripper has ridden
The doctor and others are there
Van Ripper waves
,    -- Doctor Lancaster stands with
coffin on a cart is covered by a blanket
Ichabod is crouched nearby
Why did you move the body, Doctor
To place it inside its coffin
Ichabod, nods, vaguely annoyed
He puts the horseshoe into a hoofprint in the dirt
It fits
Ichabod rises, walks, studying the ground, kicking up leaves
Brom, Van Ripper, Baltus and Philipse watch
Ichabod finds a deep hoofprint
Huge
He compares the horseshoe
The hoofprint is much larger
Ichabod pulls his satchel off his shoulder, takes out a bowl, bottle of water and bag of brown powder; begins mixing water and powder with a fork to make plaster
The others watch, finding this bizarre, whispering
Brom comes up to stand over Ichabod, irritated
What the hell are you doing
(ignoring pause) You are the blacksmith
Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large
Never
shoe that size  would have remembered
Ichabod starts to fill the print with plaster
Van Ripper
Can you show where the body lay
can show exactly
Van Ripper dismounts, wiping tobacco drool
Ichabod rises to follow with his satchel
Here
in front of this oak, facing north
Horrible
To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall
Van Ripper points
Ichabod takes a  of from his pocket
He uncorks the bottle, cautiously pouring powder in an x on the dirt there, then waiting
chemical reaction causes the powder to bubble a bit
There was not much blood, was there
didn't see none
Ichabod stands, puzzled
He walks to the coffin cart, rolling up his sleeves
Others come to watch, but keep distance
Ichabod removes the blanket
Reveals Jonathan's headless corpse
Philipse can't look
Ichabod takes strange spectacles from his satchel; wire-framed with many lenses He examines the gross neck wound, sniffs it
He pokes the flesh and severed spinal cord
No bleeding
What is that
This should have bled by the pint
Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh
How
Whatever weapon was used
it cauterized somehow
Ichabod straightens, eyes weirdly big in the spectacles
It instantly burnt the wound shut
-- coffin in a grave
Headstone reads ", 1799
" gathered
Young Masbath broods
Clergyman Steenwyck steps forward to take a handful of newly dug dirt
Men with guns stand at the outskirts, like on guard
Steenwyck sprinkles dirt into the grave with prayerful words
In the crowd people whisper
They steal glances at Ichabod, who stands with the Van Tassels
, /  -- Dining room
Sarah and two other servants collect plates few people still sup, including Van Ripper, his warty and two kids
Van Ripper guzzles ale, laughs at something his also-drunk wife says
the  and , funeral goers socialize quietly
, in the  , men smoke
Young Masbath is confronting Ichabod, who is leaving
am not here for revenge
am here to bring justice
Whatever
You still need a second to tend to your things
manage fine alone
deserve to help you
Don't you see how much this means
My father
he
he was a good man
(faces Masbath) Young Masbath,  am sorry for your loss
It is a great and sad tragedy
However
cannot be the one to look after you now
(angry) did not ask you to, did
Young Masbath exits
Ichabod remains impassive
,   -- Ichabod comes out
, a dashingly rustic man, carries his son, , 5, and chats with Baltus
Doctor Lancaster peers off at something through a
Hail, Constable
How are you
Well enough
Your gathering does honor to the deceased
(still using spyglass) We must be a curious sight to him
What are you spying on
(offers the spyglass) The Lenape
He comes to gawk at civilization from time to time
'    -- Searching a line of trees and foliage far away
(o
s
) Do you see the Redskinned bastard
There he is -- the
towering savage with misshapen features covered in tumors
He ducks away
Ichabod lowers the spyglass, a little awed
He is a behemoth
diseased monster
If you gentlemen will excuse the doctor and
we have financial matters to discuss
Ichabod and Killian nod as Baltus and Lancaster head in
Master Crane, sir
'm glad we have time alone
You've been told plenty about the Horseman, 'm certain
More than enough, actually
(tired laugh) beg you, no more, please
No, sir, no
If you ask me,  say you just laid eyes on our murderer through that glass
Ichabod ponders, folding the spyglass
Tell me something
(pause) What becomes of Young Masbath
Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take him
They have children and a good home and good land
Ichabod nods
He turns to look
In the , Van Ripper rises, ill
His wife questions his health, but he holds her off and vomits
Ichabod notes this with a deep sigh
-- Ocher dusk
Ichabod rides to Young Masbath, seated on the ground, miserable
Young Masbath does not look up
Find yourself a place in the servants' residence and wake me before dawn
Our first task will be an unsavory one
Ichabod rides
Young Masbath runs to his horse and follows
-- Steenwyck is on horseback, looking down at Ichabod, furious
It is sacrilege
cannot proceed without examining the previous victims
Steenwyck looks to men with shovels
Killian's there
Philipse, hung-over, stands beside Young Masbath
Magistrate Philipse, surely you can stop this
Philipse just looks up with a helpless expression
will not allow it
will not
Protest to my superiors if you like
Your superiors are two days away
Then, you should have left two days ago, because  have men willing to help me today
Ichabod motions
Killian leads the men to the graveyard
Steenwyck watches, enraged
He kicks his horse and rides
Philipse looks worried
--   ( ) is   by
while a coffin is exhumed
Ichabod guides the lifting
The coffin is put near the headstone "
"  Ichabod looks
At the church, Steenwyck faces about fifty people who now take up the
Across the cemetery, two coffins, one small, one large, are pried open
" , 1799
"  Killian leads the effort with Young Masbath's aid
The lids come off, revealing the   of a  and a little
Young Masbath backs away
At the "" coffin, nails creak as Ichabod opens the lid
inside, but when Ichabod does, he is aghast
He looks to the men, angry
Why was  not told of this
No answer
Killian arrives, nods solemnly
The Widow Windsor
Is that all you say
Look at her
It's not something people speak of openly
She did not remarry
Ichabod kneels, studying
Now,  : the belly of the headless corpse is bulbous, because the Widow Windsor was very far along in a pregnancy
Ichabod notices: a tear in the cloth of widow's blouse
He reaches through the tear, feeling the stomach
He straightens, greatly troubled
' ,   -- Scissors cut open the widow's blouse
There's an inch-long on the moldering belly; a sword puncture
Ichabod examines the corpse on a table
Lancaster watches, anxiously mopping his face
Young Masbath's in a corner
Ichabod goes to write in his ledger full of notes
What is the common thread between these victims
'm sure  don't know
We must discover it
The reason the murderer chose these persons
Ichabod goes to look at the widow's corpse, pondering
The wounds are the same
Cauterized
No chopping or half-measures either
One stroke took the head
Have you seen, doctor
(pointing to it) Even the spinal bone
sliced as smooth as butter
do not care
You are welcome to use my work area, but  beg you
return her to her resting place
In time, doctor
Soon as  finish
Ichabod picks up an iron knife
He looks to Young Masbath
You should step outside
-- Ichabod and others restore graves
Ichabod looks to the church, where Clergyman Steenwyck stands in the door
The devil sent you, Ichabod Crane
The Lord will not forgive your sins
Steenwyck shuts the creaky doors
, '  -- Ichabod sleeps, dreaming
'  --  -- young , 10, stands in a wheat field with his back to us
is  , getting
(
) Ichabod
Ichabod
come along
The boy,  , turns, smiling
He runs
We to a clearing behind a frontier home
waits
Lovely woman
She kisses him
'  --  '  -- Dark
Young Ichabod, in bed, has one eye open
Across the room, Mother has her back to him
She's  something to no one
She turns
Young Ichabod pretends he is asleep
is
Mother exits
Ichabod gets up, curious, opens a drawer
finds something behind clothing
It's a piece of reed grass, woven into an elaborate pattern with shafts of wheat twisted into the center
Young Ichabod replaces it, closes the drawer
'  --   -- busy, muddy street lined by wares and produce
Young Ichabod walks with , an emotionless man
Father stops to examine tools
Young Ichabod stays by him, but something captures his attention
Across the way, Mother is involved in a argument with a -
They shout
People stop to watch
Can't make out words, but Freakish Woman is furious
'  --   -- flashes over tree tops
, '  -- Ichabod jerks awake in his bed
,  -- Ichabod enters with a lantern and his ledger
He sits, studies notes, then notices there's a light down the hall
,   -- Opposite an elaborate loom, Katrina reads by candlelight
She looks up, seeing Ichabod enter
Sorry for disturbing you
thought a forgotten candle was burning
Katrina self-consciously closes her shabby book, puts it with another on her lap and covers them
You do not disturb me
Please stay
Having trouble sleeping
May  ask
why do you cover your book that way
You pay great attention to small things
hide these as  hide all my books
Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible
, um
have something to show you, if you have a moment
Ichabod sits, looking through his ledger
These are strange
may
She takes his hand, spreads the fingers to the palm
She touches the many evenly spaced scars
These scars
How did you get them
have had them since childhood cannot remember what from
It would be interesting to find out
Their eyes meet
Ichabod gets back to the ledger
Katrina seems to relish the effect she has
Ichabod finds a paper disk on string, illustrated thusly: Here it is
bird on one side
His cage on the other
Now, stare at it
(spinning it) The bird seems to be in his cage
Yes, he does
May  try
Ichabod gives it
She spins it, smiling
He only appears to be inside the cage
The point being
You made this, and the drawings
Yes, but listen
The illusion is easily explained
The eye retains each image, till they combine
And yet, some would call this toy magic
Don't you see why
Look closely a moment
Put your intellect aside
(spinning it) Can't you see what is inexplicable
Ichabod watches it spin
He shakes his head, unimpressed
Oh, you are hopeless
May  keep it at least
If you want
But
Then,  also have a gift for you
True magic which even you will not be able to deny
She hands him a book
"
"  Ichabod stands, offering it back, but she will not take it
Thank you
No
Here
insist that you have it
(resigned, leaving) Very well
But, it will only sit gathering dust
That would be a pity
Those words might show you something you've never seen before
Ichabod stops at the door, looks back
He exits
-- light glows in Ichabod's window
: Ichabod's in bed, fully dressed
He sits up
Pause
He crosses to pick up "Romeo and Juliet
"  He begins to read
'  -- Ichabod walks with Philipse
Young Masbath follows with the horses
from a vast corn field
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse
For stealing a horse
And, you dig up our dead
Are you saying  should be frightened
Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck
The   go
Young Masbath notices
We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables
Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson
know it
Um
excuse me, sirs
(still to Ichabod) Because of the Horseman, our migrant workers flee for their lives
There is a danger that our crops will rot
So, if you are going to help us, you stop the Horseman
That is your task
to kill an undead thing
Young Masbath looks to a fenced grazing area, worried
The sheep there are agitated, all running one direction away
Listen to what you say
No, you listen
You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards
At times  do
Sirs
please
What will it take for you to realize this is no laughing matter
The horses go crazy, braying and rearing
The reins yank Young Masbath off his feet as the horses flee
Ichabod and Philipse look to Masbath
is , distant:
Wind kicks up seem to come
Philipse looks to the corn field
flock of birds alights; a great sheet of black against the sky
Oh my
oh my oh my oh my
Philipse runs towards his house, past Masbath
are ,
Ichabod faces the corn field
The field explodes open, stalks bending to make way as the Headless Horseman gallops into view atop Daredevil
Young Masbath runs, following Philipse
Ichabod's stunned
He looks down to draw his flintlock pistol, but the Horseman blows by before he can raise it blast of air knocks Ichabod off his feet
The Horseman chases Masbath and Philipse
Ichabod follows
The Horseman draws his sword
Young Masbath falls in the grass
Daredevil's pounding hooves will certainly crush him
Daredevil leaps over Young Masbath, continuing the charge
Philipse has a long way to go before home
He looks over his shoulder
No way he'll make it
Ichabod, running, watches Philipse slow
Philipse gathers all his courage and stops, turning
The Horseman is closing, sword held high
Philipse raises his talisman
Philipse
Philipse holds the talisman up, trying to be fearless
The Horseman swings --   the  of sword on talisman
Philipse's severed head spins
His body falls and folds
Ichabod runs past Young Masbath
The Horseman halts just as Ichabod reaches a point in front of dead Philipse, aiming his pistol
Daredevil lets out a The Horseman rides toward Ichabod
Ichabod gets on one knee, trying to steady his pistol
The Horseman closes
Ichabod sweats bullets
The slug  the Horseman dead center -- bursts through and rends his uniform without slowing him
The Horseman is almost on Ichabod
Ichabod cringes, arms up
as the Horseman passes
The Horseman leans to skewer Philipse's head with his sword
With the head as his prize, the Horseman races away
Ichabod gets up, watches the Horseman head to the forest
Ichabod looks to Young Masbath, finds his legs will not support him, falls, trembling
,    -- Lady Van Tassel comes to a door, knocks
Sarah stands behind with a tray of food
Young Masbath is seated near
(to Young Masbath) Has he not come out at all
Young Masbath shakes his head
, '  -- is
Ichabod sleeps restlessly
'  --  '  -- and   blast open a window
Mother comes to it, then moves to comfort fearful Young Ichabod in bed

Young Ichabod's eye peers in
'  -- Mother is kneeled before flour on the floor
She draws patterns in it, whispering
She blows the flour away
'  --  '  -- The Freakish Woman (who argued with Mother) walks towards the home, supported by a
She weeps, carrying something in a blanket
Young Ichabod comes a window, watching, scared
The Freakish Woman is so weak that she falls
The blanket opens
the corpse of an infant tumbles to the dirt
The Freakish Woman's

She looks back, fearful, pulled along
in black follows
Young Ichabod struggles as Father restrains him
No

no
The Third Man peers back, a gray-haired, Cotton Mather-ish man with a villainous face
(v
o
) The night of the great storm,  saw her cross my windows
'  --  -- Many people in the gallery
The Third Man stands in front of the tearful Freakish Woman in the witness box
You are certain it was she
In the lighting,  did see her
(points) Her
Lady Crane
Mother sits in shackles
will never forget
The next moment, found my infant dead
with the blood welt on his breast
Those in attendance cry out at this
Ichabod is seated beside Father, eyes filled with tears
'  --  '  -- As before, a
Ichabod is in Mother's arms

Don't be afraid

Ichabod looks at his hands balled into fists
He opens them -- has   of '  in each palm

The  is
, '  -- Katrina enters
Ichabod sits at his work table
Are you hungry
Ichabod shakes his head, won't look up
Katrina crosses
She begins picking up pieces of the which lies shattered on the floor
You promised justice
If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am
People have put their trust in you
They have done nothing of the sort
Won't they still have that justice
(patience waning) Or, was it a vain promise
Ichabod stews, head in his hands
Someone is Young Masbath enters, frightened
Constable Crane
something has happened
-- The Lenape Indian hangs dead in a tree, lynched are gathered
Ichabod makes his way through, followed by Young Masbath, looking up
(o
s
) We do not need you, Constable
Brom strides towards Ichabod from a group of men spreading a sheet under the tree
Van Ripper's there
The men who did this have been taken
We do not need you here
Brom points to where    in chains sit in a horse-drawn cart
An armed man guards them
You should thank us
The killings will end
We saved you all
The armed man shoves the filthy man to shut him up
They spend two days in chains
Two days
For murder
For poaching
Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost
Does that look like an animal hanging
Looks like an Indian
Van Ripper cuts the noose rope at the trunk
The Lenape corpse free falls, landing hard
The Lenape lies in a heap on the sheet
Van Ripper and others come to lift the sheet with the Lenape in the middle
Ichabod watches, noticing
The Lenape wears a   of   a cord on his loin cloth, twisted in a pattern
Wait
Give me a moment
Ichabod kneels
He removes the woven piece, looking across the diseased Lenape's body
Something else
The Lenape's mouth is agape; teeth rotting
Ichabod looks around, finds a twig
He uses it to pull the Lenape's mouth open
gets close to peer inside the Lenape's mouth
, '  -- of the Lenape's   in Ichabod's ledger
The piece lies near
Ichabod sits staring at it, trance-like
Masbath waits
Long silence
The Lenape Indian had much to tell once  opened his mouth
How could he
His teeth
Someone had cut them and chipped off rotten pieces far back in his mouth
The Lenape could not have done that for himself
(closes his journal) Someone out there cared for him
Ichabod rises, deciding
He picks up his satchel and exits
Young Masbath is surprised
He follows
-- massive, wooden , raised off the ground on a 7' center post
Ichabod and Masbath walk to it
-- Ichabod and Young Masbath enter via a ladder from the underbelly
Gears and counter wheels turn millstones
few men work in the grain powder filled air
Ichabod leads the way to a staircase, up twists and turns
Where are we going
Up
-- Ichabod and Young Masbath climb out a door to the roof
The rotors spin nearby
Ichabod searches the countryside
Below,   are ride up the long straight road
What is it
It's payment day
Loan monies are given to Baltus the last day each month
Almost everyone borrows
for tools or to hire workers
Ichabod sits, takes a bowl from his bag and gives it to Masbath, then produces a bottle of water
fills the bowl
(points) Out there
What do you see
The Western Woods
Look again
plume of smoke rises from woods, far
Smoke
Chimney smoke
Ichabod holds a piece of straw in his mouth, rubs the point of a sewing needle against a small
Are you familiar with magnets
What kind of nuts
Not for eating,  assure you
Watch here
Ichabod shows the magnet grab the needle
Young Masbath is amazed, reaching for it
Ichabod watches him play with it
It's spectacular
(smiles, pause) Yes
suppose it is
Keep it
No,  couldn't
have others
All  need is this
Ichabod takes the needle, poking its butt end into the tip of the straw
Young Masbath studies the rock, pockets it
Thank you
(nods, almost shy) Now, hold the bowl steady
Back to business
Young Masbath lifts the bowl
Ichabod drops in the needle/straw which floats and turns compass-like
If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves
(uneasy) Father said witches live there
Witches do not exist
However
Ichabod uses a knife to notch the bowl lip where the needle points, then surveys the smoke, making a second notch
Not long ago,  would have said the same for Headless Horseman
(o
s
) Constable
Katrina's on horseback below, unhappy
need to speak with you
Alone
-- Ichabod and Katrina lead their horses
heated argument
Why would you do such a thing
No stone may be left unturned
It may appear harsh
have misjudged you  think
did not imagine you were so cruel
You are not regarding it in full
The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword
followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path could not comprehend till  had seen the Horseman with my own eyes
What are you on about
The child she carried was eight months grown at least
near to birthing
The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly
Must  hear this
There was no blind stabbing
This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother
And this gives worth to butchery
It was not butchery
What is it then
Scientific method
How can any of this matter in the slightest
have no solution for its meaning yet, but  could not just ignore it
Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane
He follows with you to avenge his father's death
That  understand
But, what do you want
To avenge his father, and the others
But, why
Tell me why
Ichabod struggles for a reply
You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it
Can't you see
You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it
(fed up, growing anger) If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it
Not for a moment
So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl
on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours
And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber
Katrina storms away
Ichabod's already regretting
-- Ichabod and Young Masbath ride to the Western Woods, horses loaded for expedition
At the Belltower remnants, Ichabod slows, looking to the wreckage
At forest's edge, Young Masbath waits
Ichabod circles the tower
With a sigh, he rides to join Young Masbath
They head into the woods
-- Dark, dense and creepy
Ichabod and Young Masbath move through
Young Masbath halts his horse and looks around
What is it
Listen
(listens, looks) hear nothing
No crickets or cicadas calling
No bird songs
Stark quiet
Ichabod notes this unhappily
-- Ichabod's hand drops the needle/straw in the water bowl
The needle spins
The bowl is turned to match notches
Ichabod points the way to Young Masbath
,  :
them as they ride,
,   -- Ichabod and Masbath reach a hill crest
They stop, uneasy
Below: a  with a rock archway
An ill-fitting door covers the mouth
The chimney spews smoke
We have apparently arrived
-- The horses are tied to a tree
Ichabod walks to the cave door
Unsure, he hesitantly knocks
-- Ichabod and Young Masbath step in
Walls are hung with skins and skeletons, dry flowers and reed grass in patterns
An   sits facing away
The old Crone, a mountain woman with matted hair and grey features, sits disinterested
Ichabod edges closer
Pardon
You did not answer when knocked
Are we intruding
You are from the Hollow
In a way, yes
Ichabod looks at tables of gourd bowls of dead insects and acorns
Knifes, scissors, yellow bones
He takes the Lenape's piece of reed grass from his pocket
The Lenape who lived in these woods
do you know him
The Redman
(uncomfortable wait) should tell you
he has been murdered
Leave me
You are not welcome here
The old Crone places something on a table beside her -- a dead cardinal, bright red
Ichabod is afraid, backing away, but Young Masbath takes the woven piece and steps to the Crone
Were you a friend to the Indian
(waits) You should have this
if you were his friend
Young Masbath puts the woven piece beside the cardinal
He walks to join Ichabod in leaving
You seek remedy against the Horseman
The Old Crone reaches to pick up the weaving
She stands, faces them
Tall
Ichabod nods
(to Young Masbath) Go out and keep away, child
(to Ichabod) You stay
Follow with me
The Old Crone takes a candle and walks, deep into the cave
,   -- The Old Crone comes through a passage in the wet walls
Ichabod enters, scared, bent under low ceiling
hear him
He rides to the Hollow and back
The Horseman
Yes
Sit
Ichabod sits on crooked stool
The old Crone kneels with her back to him, gathers straw in a pile on the floor
Can you help
You want to see into the nether world
can show you
Whatever you see, do not move or speak
will hold him
She gathers bowls, putting grass and powder on the pile
What
what are you doing
(turns, furious) Close your mouth
Keep silent
She takes two jars from a table, pours ashes on the pile from one
She shakes the other roughly, takes the lid off and upends it
baby bat squirms on the floor, dazed
The Old Crone holds the bat, using a knife to cut off its head
She soaks the straw with blood,   , guttural
Using a wick, she lights the straw
She grasps two   with chains attached, slides these onto her bony wrists, then bends to inhale smoke
He comes now
Ichabod would like to leave now
-- Young Masbath, waiting by the horses, looks up
Through the trees, black clouds billow and block the sun
,   -- The old Crone slumps, still with her back to Ichabod
She does not move
Wind howls through a hole/window
Rain
Candles blow out
Ichabod stands, worried
Excuse me
um
She remains motionless
The  outside intensifies
the skin of the Crone's wrists transform; swelling in the cuffs, hardening, cracking and bleeding
Some thing Ichabod cannot see
He inches closer
Are you alright
The Crone turns, hideous, leaping erect -- a half-human, half-demon
Its black clawed hands reaching
Ichabod recoils, crying out
Chains on restraining cuffs yank the creature back
Ichabod hits the floor, knocking over a table of bones
The creature is chained, but still wants Ichabod
It
The Old Crone's face seethes from transformation, eyes blood red, nostrils dripping, teeth now jagged
/ You seek the warrior bathed in blood
the Headless Horseman
Ichabod slides back as far as possible while the creature claws the rock floor, yearning
/ Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies
Follow to the tree of the dead
The creature pulls, testing the chains
Behind, the holding the chains to the wall slips
The wall cracks
/ Climb down to the Horseman's soulless place and let loose his silent shrieking
Do you hear
Do you hear
Ichabod nods, quaking, aghast
He glances to the exit
The chain bolt gives more
coming loose
/ He who holds fast the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand
Catch hold of his desire
Ichabod bolts for the door
The creature , leaping
The chain bolt breaks
Ichabod cries out, tackled to the floor
It is the Old Crone who landed on him
She has returned to human form, semi-conscious
Ichabod shoves her off
-- Ichabod runs out into the howling storm, past Masbath
We are leaving
What happened
Ichabod scrambles onto Gunpowder, heading further into the woods, glancing back
Young Masbath follows
,   -- No rain
Dark
lantern's glow creates shifting shadows as Ichabod and Young Masbath ride
Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies
To the tree of the dead
(looking back) Maybe we passed it by
How could something named "the tree of the dead" fail to draw attention
Ichabod's startled, looking up
The is
Leaves float downwards
We should not go much further in this murk
Should we go back
We are far from the Hollow
(dismounts, troubled) Loath to say it
better to get our backs against a tree and stay till morning
( ) -- Horses are tied
Ichabod is seated against a tree campfire burns
Young Masbath lies on a blanket, rifle cross his chest, staring to treetops
Leaves and branches shift in the wind
Bats fly wildly
What does it mean
climb down to the Horseman's soulless place
"Let loose his silent shrieking
" Who knows, till we work at it admit not being anxious to find out
(pause) "He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand
" Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives
Ichabod raises his pistol
(to Young Masbath) Do not move
Ichabod rises
He creeps forward, pistol and lantern forward
Foliage is thick
are
Ichabod crouches, puts down the lantern and picks up a branch
He tosses the branch to the foliage
darts away, a running blur
Ichabod rises, following with his pistol
, : low to the ground, moving swiftly at Ichabod
Ichabod spins, blindsided
Young Masbath fires his rifle --
The  is   mid-leap, yelping
The beast lands, a mass of grey fur
Ichabod comes to stare down
Young Masbath arrives
They both look to the beast, horrified
The creature lies helplessly spastic; a - , with one head blown open to brain and gore
Its living head lifts,  sadly, eyes pleading
Ichabod step up with pistol
What God-forsaken hell is this
Ichabod swallows back sickness, looking away
Something catches his eye
Christ
Through the forest: the '
Distant fire
,   -- Ichabod and Masbath ride up, confronted by the Crone's cave vomiting flame out all orifices
Ichabod approaches
Embers swirl everywhere
The Old Crone's body lies amongst bloodied leaves
Headless
, '  -- Much commotion
in front of the home marked ",
"  Steenwyck addresses the rabble
You all stand idle, while this man goes about with a book of secrets and a bag filled with magic
You all stand idle, while the shadow of the Devil falls over our town
Baltus, Lady Van Tassel and Katrina watch at safe distance
say, if you do nothing, you share in the blasphemy of Ichabod Crane
Killian, on horseback beside his wife, , and son, Thomas, rides to one side of the shouting crowd
Listen to me
Do you want to save your crops
Or would you rather see your farms go to ruin
How is he saving our farms
How
Ichabod Crane has brought into our midst the soulless, moldering corpse of a heretic
' ,   -- Ichabod examines the Crone's neck wound with magnification spectacles
Young Masbath is seated, ledger in his lap
The wound is neither smooth nor cauterized, but jagged
She bleeds like a fountain
Ichabod lifts her dead hand to show bruises and cuts
She did not go quietly
' ,  -- Doctor Lancaster wrings his hands
His  rocks nervously in a rocking chair
The  outside  as a bonfire lights up the curtained windows
The front door is  open
enter
Lancaster stands, lips quivering
He points insistently to a door
' ,   -- Angry men break in
Ichabod looks up
Step aside, Constable
Step aside
Ichabod is shoved aside, spectacles knocked off
The group grasps the Crone
Masbath stands on his chair, clutching the ledger
Ichabod grabs one man
What are you doing
The man slams Ichabod back
Magnification spectacles are crushed under foot
-- Angry men carry the corpse to a raging bonfire
The mob makes way
Steenwyck cheers them
Let her burn
Let her burn
Ichabod comes out, followed by Young Masbath
The Crone's corpse is thrown in the fire
Cheers all around
At Ichabod's side, a man tries to grab the ledger Young Masbath holds
Young Masbath cries out, hanging on to the book
Ichabod joins the struggle
Katrina watches, emotions conflicting
Other men grab Ichabod
One punches Ichabod in the face
Katrina rides forward as Baltus calls for her to stop
Katrina leaps down, into the crowd, pulls men off Ichabod
Stop this
Leave them alone
Chaos halts
Everyone turns, quieting
The men around Masbath and Ichabod turn to face Brom Bones
Brom holds a smoking pistol, flanked by Theodore and Glenn
Let them go (pointing) Are you going to beat an orphaned child, imbecile
Masbath is released, along with the ledger
Steenwyck moves forward, pushing people aside
Are you Ichabod Crane's protector, Brom Bones
Only for the moment
You side with him in this
No
agree he has only made matters worse
But, that will change, if you listen
He trades with Theodore, pistol for a long rifle
Brom hefts the rifle, taking a round slug from his pocket
Theodore, Glenn and  offer to ride each day and night to watch over the Hollow
We will stalk the border of the Western Woods and haunt the Horseman for a change, with rifles like this
and slugs like this
Brom brings the slug to his lips, blows
It
Hollowed out and filled with powder
Brom smiles at Katrina, who watches unimpressed
Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side
fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing
You must have missed your mark
hit him square
(to the crowd) say
if the Horseman is solid enough to take the lives of our people, he's solid enough to feel this
Brom aims the rifle at a  down the road
-- the barrel is hit --
Smoke wafts
, '  -- In bed, Ichabod is having unpleasant dreams once more
(v
o
) The night of the great storm,  saw her cross my windows
'  --  -- Young Ichabod is seated beside Father, eyes tearful
We are back in the court where Mother stands trial
In the lightning,  did see her
(points to Mother) Her
Lady Crane
will never forget it
The next moment,  found my infant son was dead, with the blood welt on his breast
The evil Third Man turns to a jury of
You have heard it
The blood welt is the mark of Satan's touch
As the crowd murmurs in fear, Young Ichabod looks to Father, who sits with hands clenched, emotionless
'  --  '  -- In the quiet kitchen, Young Ichabod looks across the table
Father stares into his food
She was with me, father
Nothing can be done against them
She was with me that night
Father doesn't even look up
'  --  -- Empty church
Young Ichabod carries a lantern past pews soldier is seated near the altar with a rifle
May  see her
The soldier exits through a white door
Young Ichabod waits, looking up at the vast church
The white door opens and the Third Man steps out
Go home
May  see my mother
You do not want to be here
Go home to your father
She did not do it
please listen
She is guilty
No, sir, please
she is innocent
She has confessed
No
She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession
Do you know what confession is
(off Ichabod's nod) All that is left for you now is to pray for her soul
The Third Man leaves through the white door
'  --  '  -- Young Ichabod buttons his shirt
'  --  '  -- Young Ichabod comes out, looks to the lawn, not understanding
Father loads a wagon full of belongings
We are leaving
(long pause) She has gone away
Realization comes to Young Ichabod
He runs, away across the lawn as Father calls after him
'  --   -- Young Ichabod runs, weeping
(v
o
) She has confessed
'  --  -- Empty
Doors are thrown open and Young Ichabod enters
He goes down the aisle, towards the white door
(v
o
) She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession
Mother
'  -- ,    -- Young Ichabod enters, halting
The room contains : iron cuffs, thumb screws, knifes and needles
(v
o
) Do you know what confession is
He walks, numb, eyes locked forward
In the corner is a  , adorned with sharp iron spikes
Hundreds of spikes
It is fitted with straps for holding down the "accused
" Tears stream down Young Ichabod's face
He kneels, hands on the spikes of the chair, pressing hard
As he sobs, blood runs down from his hands
, '  -- In bed, Ichabod opens tear filled eyes
He sits up, bringing his trembling hands to wipe his cheeks
His hands trail blood
He looks to them
The old scars are bleeding
,   -- Katrina comes to the door
Ichabod is seated by the fire, eyes bleary, palms wrapped with bloodied cloth
Constable Crane
Katrina comes beside Ichabod's chair
Allow me some time
have spent every hour in the company of others
need to be alone
What troubles you
She moves in front
Ichabod gets up and crosses to sit facing away
Katrina takes the chair he deserted
The things  said to you before
was wrong to say them
No, actually, you were not
Every word you spoke had truth in it
What has happened
Ichabod sits silent, puts his head back, eyes closed
Lady Van Tassel
she is your stepmother, isn't she
She bears so little resemblance
What
She is not your birth mother, is she
No, but
why do you ask that
What happened to your mother
Is she still alive
She died
Her lungs were diseased
two years ago
What is this about
Memories have come back
had them forgotten, and wish  could forget them again
but they are here now
(pause) Lord, how  hate this place
If you want me to go,  will
Do you want me to leave
do not know
no longer know what  think or what  feel
Katrina walks to him
She touches his back
Why are you so afraid of that
Is there truly such harm in uncertainty
She kneels, smiles a little for him
She reaches to touch his face, holds his head in her hands
Leans to kiss him
He rests his head against hers, weary, putting his arms around her
They kiss passionately
-- Dawn light, is visible over forests pounded by rain
,    -- Ichabod exits his room, satchel in hand
He looks down the hall, then steps back in to take a white rose from a vase
, Ichabod comes to the last door
He bends, slipping the white rose under the crack of the door
,   -- Rain
Ichabod comes out
Across the lawn, Young Masbath is bringing the horses
(o
s
) Good morrow, Constable
Ichabod turns to see Lady Van Tassel in a chair, sewing
Returning to the Western Woods
Yes, actually
Use caution
(nods, studies her) Do you know
think those are the first words  have heard from you my entire time here
As my husband says, a wife should be always like an echo, and at the same time, quite unlike an echo
(off Ichabod's confusion) Like an echo, she should speak only when spoken to, and unlike an echo, should never try to have the last word, or, at least that is what he believes
Baltus comes out the door, irritable, skillet in hand
Constable
did you notice anything out of the ordinary during the night
Ichabod eyes the skillet, ill at ease, trying not to be
Um
did not
no
Why
Sarah has gone missing
my servant girl
Her things are gone
Damn it
She has joined the migration out of town
(to Lady Van Tassel) What about breakfast, woman
Or, am to starve to death
Lady Van Tassel gets up and goes in, taking the skillet
should be going
good day to you
Ichabod heads towards Young Masbath
Baltus watches from the porch, disgruntled
He goes in
-- Heavy rain
Ichabod and Young Masbath ride side by side
If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian
Someone only tried to make it look that way
You grow sharper by the minute, little man
It boggles my mind, but  begin to prefer your company over all others
Well
'm one of the few people who likes you
(laughs) True enough
Then, who murdered the Old Crone
And why
Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply
is
Ichabod looks back, then to Masbath
Quicken pace
Ichabod rides faster
Young Masbath keeps up
, they charge over a hill
Ichabod halts Gunpowder and climbs clumsily off
Ride on
Young Masbath obeys
Ichabod takes out his pistol and wades into forest growth, backtracking
, Ichabod bounds through underbrush, low is
He pushes through branches
Moving behind a      on horseback
Halt and turn
have a pistol aimed at your head
The figure stops, pushes off the cloak hood
Katrina
It is only me
Katrina
Why do you follow
apologize if  worried you
woman should not be out alone in these woods
But,  am not alone, am
only wished to see what you were up to, and
(takes out  ) To thank you
Ichabod softens, but doesn't want to
Come along
,     -- Raining still
Ichabod, Masbath and Katrina come into a clearing, mouths falling open at the sight of
monstrously huge    , at the clearing's center, with branches reaching far and wide, knotted and gross, like agony captured in wood sculpture
Ichabod dismounts, crossing a line beyond which grass and weeds will not grow
Young Masbath and Katrina dismount
You were right
it does draw attention to itself
Ichabod stares up into the endless, dead canopy of branches
He circles the incredibly wide trunk
There's a   in the bark, as if the tree once had a terrible vertical in it, now partially healed and disgustingly scarred
Ichabod approaches
He feels the mushy scar, picking at its scabs till much sap begins to trickle
It is red and Ichabod fingers it
Blood
What did you say
Ichabod goes to where Katrina and Masbath wait with the horses, digs in a saddle bag for a hand axe
What is it
Stay back
At the trunk, Ichabod thumps the flat end of the axe against the suture
It sounds hollow
Ichabod begins to chop
He pulls away loose bark
The tree drips more blood and a clear goo
Ichabod uses both hands on the axe to hack at the festering suture
What are you doing
Just
keep where you are
Ignoring, Young Masbath moves closer
Ichabod keeps chopping, then grips a large, loose flap of wood, trying to bend it
It's not easy
Ichabod struggles
Katrina follows Masbath's slow advance
Ichabod's pulling
the flap suddenly gives, revealing a blood-soaked, wide-eyed, gap-mouthed
Ichabod recoils
Behind him, Katrina stifles a scream, taking Young Masbath in her arms to keep him from looking
It is Philipse's head, hanging off the trunk flap, held by roots grown around and into the flesh
Ichabod reapproaches, back of his hand to his mouth
other ,   are held by ingrown roots within the dewy innards
My God
what has happened
He
he tries to take the heads
they will not pass
He looks to the branches towering above
Must be some sort of gateway
But, why this place
We should go
Why this tree
Ichabod begins looking at the ground, moving around the tree
He gets to his knees, pushing mud away
Uncovering a flush  carved with "666
" (to himself) "Climb down to the Horseman's soulless place
" (to Masbath) Bring the shovel
,     -- Rain
Young Masbath's crouched, muddy, rifle across his knees
He's watching the tree
Behind him, Katrina climbs out of the shallow grave near a pile of mud
Ichabod hands up the shovel
Masbath, we've found it
Young Masbath goes to the grave
Ichabod pulls at thick burlap cloth, straining as it comes away
Ichabod looks down, disbelieving
It cannot be true
: roots have gripped the Horseman's bones and tattered uniform
The skeleton is all there -- except the skull
Why is it every grave  open holds a new mystery inside
The skull is gone
Yes
did notice that, thank you
Ichabod climbs out, weary in body and spirit
He stares at the bones
This is his silent shrieking
and his desire, to reclaim his head
Ichabod turns, looking to the bordering forest
"He who holds fast the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand
" (pause) Someone controls the Horseman
(o
s
) Ichabod
Ichabod turns, looks
Katrina and Young Masbath back away, because the  in the grave are , further entwining around remains
Ichabod spins to the twisted tree
The vertical  , pulling inwards
sucking Philipse's head back in and closing, bubbling
Ichabod bounds over grave dirt pile, hastening Katrina and Young Masbath along as he flees
At the tree, the suture swells
Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath pass where their freaking horses are tied to a fallen trunk, heading for cover
is  from the twisted tree, which suddenly wide, spitting smoldering cinders
At the tree line, Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath cower, looking back
From the tree wound, a glow brightens, till the Headless Horseman and Daredevil  into existence
They hit the ground running
Ichabod watches the Horseman ride away with bolts of the
The Horseman disappears in the forest
His next victim is chosen
(to Masbath) Give me distance, then guide her back to the Hollow
Ichabod runs towards the horses
Constable
-- The Horseman rips past on Daredevil
-- Ichabod rides as fast as Gunpowder is able
' ,  -- Small home
Killian, Thomas and Beth have finished supper
Beth clears plates as Killian picks his teeth with a knife
May  be excused, father
Do you deserve to be
(shyly) think so
(smiles) Then, go
Thomas gets down from his chair
He goes to the fireplace to light a tallow wick, which he takes to the next room
' ,   -- Thomas plops on the floor and lights his  : a lantern with an outer sleeve of glass painted with silhouettes of lions and monsters
Thomas turns the lantern and looks to the walls where the creatures, shadows are thrown
He roars for them, imagining them real and having a grand time
' ,  -- Beth comes for more dishes
Don't pick teeth
You teach Thomas bad habits
Killian pulls her to him, playful
am a bad habit
There's nothing for it
(kisses him) No one knows better than
' ,   -- Thomas continues his fun, shadow animals circling him
In the shifting light, a baby spider comes from a crack in the wall
Then, another spider skitters out
More follow
-- black horse runs, hooves pounding the ground
is The horse slows and stops
it is Brom's horse, with Brom aboard
Brom looks skyward
The storm harshens, roaring through the trees
Distant can be
Brom takes his rifle off his shoulder
The  grow and , far away
Brom turns in the saddle and He kicks his horse and rides
' ,   -- Thomas still watches shadow beasts, but sees something else
He goes to the crack where hundreds of spiders flee all directions
Thomas is amused
' ,  -- Behind Killian, mantelpiece stones pulse, breathing almost imperceptibly
Demonic faces form, then disappear and reform again, shifting
' ,   -- Beth enters, looking at Thomas
What are you doing there
The magic lantern stops spinning
Shadow creatures freeze
' ,  -- The
Killian looks up
The   is

Spiders
Beth bends to see the swarming spiders
She looks up, noticing the  of the

The   again, then suddenly the
Silence
Beth

The magic lantern creatures begin spinning anew, all around

Killian looks
the fire shoots up the fireplace

Behind Killian, the
The Horseman steps in, a battle axe in each hand

Killian grabs a kitchen chair and hurls it at the Horseman
The Horseman swings, smashing it aside
Beth

' ,   -- Beth hugs Thomas to her as she backs away
(o
s
) (from kitchen) Get out
' ,  -- Killian grabs an iron skewer from the fireplace, swings it to fend off a blow from the Horseman
The Horseman swings the other axe
Killian ducks
The axe cracks fireplace stone, throwing sparks
Killian lunges, jamming the skewer into the Horseman
The skewer comes through the Horseman's back
The Horseman swipes with the flat of one axe -- pounding Killian aside
Killian hits the wall, bashing his head
Hits the floor
' ,   -- Beth kicks a carpet to reveal a trap door
' ,  -- The Horseman pulls the skewer out of his body, throws it
He goes to lift Killian by the hair with one hand, brings back the axe in the other
' ,   -- At the trap door, Beth lowers Thomas to stairs leading to the cellar
Thomas is crying
Don't let him get you
Mommy
You hide now
go
Beth closes the trap door, frantically replacing the carpet
The room's door flies open and the Horseman strides in, carrying Killian's severed head
Beth shrieks
The Horseman steps forward, knocks over the magic lantern
' ,  -- Beth's  are abruptly
Her  is the floor above
Thomas crosses the cellar, stumbles
He scurries into the shelter of a wheelbarrow propped against the wall

' ,    -- The Horseman's hands place Killian's and Beth's heads in a sack, cinching the sack shut
' ,  -- The Headless Horseman enters, bends to retrieve the battle axe he left
He stands
Pause
' ,  -- Thomas' trembling hands pull the wheelbarrow closer
He tries to control his sobbing
' ,  -- The Horseman turns, falls to his knees
He starts to chop at the floor with both axes
CHOPping,  CHOPping,  CHOPping
making quick work of it
' ,  -- hole appears in the ceiling as debris falls
Thomas looks up, terrified
He gets up to run away
The Horseman's arm shoves through above, grasping Thomas and yanking him up
'  -- Brom rides from the forest, charging across Killian's field
At Killian's house, Daredevil rides up as the Headless Horseman walks out with his sack of heads
The Horseman ties the sack to the saddle and leaps up
Brom puts his reins in his mouth, raising his rifle
The Horseman heads away, past the barn, as Brom gains
Brom aims
-- the slug , blowing the Horseman off Daredevil
Daredevil keeps going
The Horseman's smoldering body is left "face down
" Brom halts his horse
He climbs down, pleased
The Horseman moves
Brom backs away, satisfaction diminishing
The Horseman gets on his knees
Brom falls to one knee, begins reloading
He fills the gun from his powder horn
The Horseman stands, unsheathes his sword and turns
The blast has blown apart his uniform at the chest and shoulder, exposing rotten flesh and maggot-infested muscle
Brom readies his ramrod, jamming powder in the barrel
The Horseman charges
Brom stands, pulling out the ramrod
The Horseman is on him
Brom swings the rifle, blocking
Sparks fly
The battle is on, with Brom fending off the Horseman's sword with the gun --  --  --
, Ichabod and Gunpowder break into the open
, the Horseman makes a backhanded swing
Brom goes down, his rifle sent flying
Brom rolls to avoid as the Horseman slashes
Brom flees
The Horseman pulls and throws a knife
-- the knife imbeds in Brom's thigh
The Horseman runs towards Brom
Ichabod closes in, pulling an unlit lantern off his saddle
Brom tries to get up, bends to extract the knife
The Horseman, mid-run, changes his sword grip, blade down
He plants one foot on Brom's back, raising his sword, about to skewer
Ichabod arrives full gallop,  the lantern into the Horseman -- knocking the Horseman off Brom
, Theodore and Glen arrive on horseback
They hold a moment, watching
Brom runs, limping, to the barn, goal in sight: farm implements propped there
Brom grabs  with long curved blades, one in per hand
The Horseman rises
Ichabod turns Gunpowder and leaps off, runs to Brom
The Horseman moves towards them, hefting a battle axe in his free hand
Ichabod steps up, pistol aimed, furious
For what it's worth
-- the bullet rips through the Horseman's stomach to reveal putrid innards as he keeps advancing
At the forest, Theodore looks to Glenn, turns and flees
Brom steps up, scythes ready
He and the Horseman go at it
Brom blocks axe and sword, catching and deflecting blows
At the forest, Glenn follows Theodore away
Ichabod grabs a long handled
Brom swings the scythes
The Horseman avoids
Ichabod moves to the side, looking for an opening
He swings the sickle
The Horseman blocks
The Horseman battles both at once, catching blows
countering every strike,
Brom catches the Horseman's sword in one scythe, holding it off
Catches the axe handle in the other scythe
The Horseman flatfoot  Brom's chest, sending him down
Ichabod swings the sickle blade
Hits the Horseman, the blade embedding to the hilt
The Horseman drops his axe and grasps the sickle, jerking
The sickle handle  Ichabod's, knocking him away
Ichabod crawls, tries to shake off the blow
He looks up
The Horseman staggers, spastically trying to pull the blade from his body
Brom limps to Ichabod, yanks him to his feet
We cannot win this
They head towards the forest
Behind, the Horseman extracts the sickle, throws it
He strides after them, picks up his axe on the way
-- Ichabod and Brom stumble down a hillside
Brom points
There
They run to a  at the edge of a wide, rapid river
They jump into a   barge
Go to the front and guide it
Ichabod goes
Brom uses a scythe to slash the ropes
Ichabod picks up a
The barge lurches, set free
Ichabod struggles to push the boat out
it moves swiftly, caught in rain swollen current
Brom looks back
No Horseman
He leaves the scythe and moves to the front, hefting another pole to help guide
Let's see him catch us now
Ichabod looks to the shore
Horror
Look
-- ahead, the Horseman stands on the bank with Axe and sword
Daredevil near
We'll pass right by the son of a bitch
Ichabod and Brom push with the poles, trying for speed
At the bank, the Horseman walks directly to the water
Just as he takes a step onto the water, the rain churned surface  -- instantly  a  of
and supporting the Horseman as he advances
ahead of him, towards a point in the river where it will intercept the barge
My Christ
The Horseman's   engulfs the barge,
Ichabod and Brom are thrown
The barge is trapped
The Horseman nears
Brom runs to the rear to retrieve his scythe
Ichabod holds up the only weapon he has, his guide pole
The Horseman steps on board
Ichabod swings
The Horseman's axe cracks the pole in half
The Horseman thrusts with sword -- into Ichabod's chest -- clean through
It  as Ichabod screams
The Horseman lifts Ichabod up, flips him, pulling the sword out as Ichabod goes
through the ice and under
: water carries Ichabod, slams him against ice above
He's pulled down by undertow
, beyond the edge of the ice bridge: Ichabod comes up, gasping, choking on rain
He treads water, looking to the barge
'
-- Aboard the barge, the Horseman cuts Brom down
stands over him, chopping with sword
Our  grows , and
/ , '  -- Candlelight
Ichabod, shirtless, feverish, opens his eyes
The wound at the top of his chest is raw
Katrina inserts a needle in the skin around it
Lay still, Ichabod
Do not move
Doctor, he is awake
Ichabod tries to sit
Pain stops him
Lady Van Tassel helps bleed the wound with the needle and a tube leading to a of blood
(barely a voice) What
what are you doing
'm drawing bad blood from the wound
Doctor Lancaster comes to the bed
Keep still, Constable
You were half-drowned when they found you
Brom Bones
He is dead
You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut
Bring Young Masbath here
You need to sleep
Bring him
You need rest
Ichabod gives up, closes his eyes
Katrina, needle in one hand, brings her other hand to hold Ichabod's
Blood drips into the suction jar
, '  -- Ichabod is soundly asleep
Across the room, Katrina is at his work table
Ichabod stirs
Katrina looks to him
Once she is satisfied he will not wake, she returns to what she was doing, turning a page
She is reading his ledger
' ', '  -- Young Masbath lies awake
glint of light crosses the window
Masbath looks to it, gets up, peers out
, he can see the Van Tassel Manor House in the distance
Lantern  crosses the lawn
,  -- The lantern light moves through the orchard, away from the house
We cannot make out the person
Elsewhere, Young Masbath runs in pursuit
He hides against one tree, leans to look
The light enters forest
Young Masbath follows
, '  -- Ichabod's hurting
Masbath helps with a shirt
Someone left last night
Looked like they headed to the square, but lost them in the forest
Man or woman
All  saw was their lantern
Business, best hidden is hidden best at night
Ichabod goes to his work table, organizing his satchel
If someone has the Horseman's skull
if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet
Because,  serve a fine purpose alive
It is perfection for our murderer if return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul
(pause) We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted
What was taken from them
other than their lives
Who benefits by their deaths
Ichabod fumbles the bottle of white powder
It bounces, cork popping out
rolls under the bed
Damn it
Ichabod kneels, pained
trail of the blood-detecting powder has spilled
The bottle is out of reach
'll get it
Young Masbath gets down, ready to crawl for it, but Ichabod stops him, peering under
Wait
Far under, near the bottle, some powder is bubbling
Ichabod moves to the end of the bed and lifts, in pain
Young Masbath helps
They drag the bed to one side
Under the bed: a Satanic  has been
Ichabod stares, trying to grasp the implication
Masbath is about to speak, but Ichabod puts a finger to his lips
Ichabod moves to lock the door
(whispers) Who did this
Ichabod does not answer
He picks up a wash basin and dumps the water to wash the Pentagram away
/ -- ,  and  swarm
loots the town's general store
Provisions are passed along man to man and loaded on wheelbarrows
All up and down the long straight road, home owners board up windows with lumber
Ichabod and Young Masbath ride, passing many angry faces
Panic has set in
They stop, tying their horses and climbing stairs to the door of the "
"  Ichabod looks off
, at the far end, people head to the church
Much activity there as well
Sanctuary
Or, so they hope
Families put up tents all around the church within the bordering wrought-iron fence
Supplies abound
People work to build and erect massive wooden crosses
, '  -- Tidy room
Young Masbath watches Ichabod hand a slip of paper to the elderly Notary, Hardenbrook
Do you have these persons' wills
have everything
last testaments
birth certificates, death certificates
deeds
Yes, sir
but, do you have these
Hardenbrook studies the paper with his one good eye
Certainly
certainly
Hardenbrook nods, handing the list back, grinning
Ichabod stands waiting
Hardenbrook is still nodding
May  see them, Master Hardenbrook
Hmm
See them
May we look at them now
Of course
You want them
it shall not take long
Wait here
Hardenbrook heads across the room
Ichabod offers the list
Maybe you should take this
fine idea
Hardenbrook takes it and exits
Young Masbath sits
What good is this
To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place
Ichabod waits
After a moment, he looks uncertain
He crosses to the half-open door
,   -- Ichabod sticks his head in, not liking what he sees
Hardenbrook's amidst unbelievable disarray
Tables, shelves, and baskets of unevenly piled documents
Hardenbrook looks on a shelf, confused, then goes to a table, lifting papers, mumbling
Damn
damn
damn
Master Hardenbrook
Hardenbrook turns, a bit startled
Perhaps,  could assist in finding them
Well
that might be
helpful
,   ( ) -- Hardenbrook is asleep in a chair, snoring, blind eye open
Ichabod and Young Masbath face official-looking documents, with Ichabod focused on one will in hand
My father had farm land
It was the only thing we owned of any value
(still reading) And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus
heard him say it
Yes
Ichabod turns the will in his hand to Masbath
Then look here at your father's will, and tell me why you are not listed
Young Masbath takes it, boggled
Ichabod grabs another
Van Garrett had denoted his elder son in his last wishes; the same son murdered along with him
But Van Garrett's wife and two infant children are not written
and they were spared
(picks up another will) Do you see
Philipse had no family to bestow his farm to
But, here
(picks up another) The Widow Windsor was listed on her late husband's will
After her inheritance, she amended the document to include her bastard child
This is why the Horseman made absolutely certain to impale the unborn descendant
Ichabod sits back
Only the heirs were killed
Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment
But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away
No one yet, far as  can tell
It has gone intestate
In test
what
Intestate
Your farm
all the farms
they belong to no one
What does it mean
Ichabod stares off
Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to
And, who in this town is owed a great many debts
(realization) Baltus Van Tassel
Did your father take a loan
Yes
rode with him on payment days
Ichabod stands, grim, gathering wills and his ledger
Tonight, we answer questions
And, to discover who moves about the Van Tassel house after dark
all we need is a candle
is  from the other room
Ichabod looks
'  -- Ichabod bursts in
No one there
chair has been knocked over and the front door is ajar
Ichabod moves
-- Ichabod exits
All around is the commotion in the square as before
No telling who it was who just fled
, '  -- Young Masbath is seated, bored
Ichabod writes in his ledger
on the door
They both look up
(o
s
) (from outside door) Constable
are you there
(long pause) Ichabod
The knob is tried and found locked
Pause
At the bottom of the door, a red rose is passed under
This saddens Ichabod
-- Quiet night
The church is a sight, with a yard resembling an empty squatter's tent city, surrounded by crosses
Boarded over windows leak shafts of light
: many eyes peer out from the slats
,   are on watch
, '  -- Ichabod and Masbath are in darkness, still waiting
Ichabod takes the cover off a lantern, looks at a clock
Midnight, straight up
Ichabod stands, picks up an unlit candle
Midnight seems an appropriate time
,  -- Ichabod and Young Masbath look out, cautious
They move to the nearest door
Ichabod crouches, using the candle to mark the seam of the door and door frame
He's making a low, wax seal
If the door opens, the seal will break
They move to a second door, quietly
Ichabod makes another low wax mark
,   -- Ichabod and Masbath come downstairs to a hall
Ichabod continues his wax marking at each door
, '  -- Ichabod and Young Masbath enter, shutting the door
Ichabod walks to shelves at Baltus' desk, looks through ribbon bound and hands some to Masbath
Young Masbath pulls off the ribbon, pages through these " " parchments
Ichabod brings another pile
(whispering) They are alphabetical
Young Masbath has the 's
"," "," "
" Not finding what he wants
There is no Masbath here
My father's loan papers are missing
(regarding his documents) There are none for Magistrate Philipse either
"Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William
" Ichabod looks, blows out the lantern
He and Young Masbath stand frozen
Across the room, light comes under the door, stops, then continues
is   and
Ichabod crosses to follow, pointing back
Keep looking
Then, hide in my room and bolt the door till  return
-- Lantern light moves, far ahead
Ichabod follows
,   -- Ichabod stops, hidden
He can see the light ahead, but it is no longer in motion
He advances
-- lantern sits on a rock
On a blanket, a semi-naked  and semi-naked  are in the midst of rough
Ichabod crawls to peer from underbrush
The couple keeps coupling, with the man on top
His grunts and gasps are particularly desperate
He's all over the woman, who lays back
it is Lady van Tassel
Ichabod swallows, inches closer
Lady van Tassel pulls the man's shirt, exposes his flesh
She raises a small, sharp  behind his back
Ichabod's eyes widen
Lady Van Tassel brings the blade to her own hand, slicing deep in her palm
Blood flows
She rubs her cut hand over her partner's arching back, smearing blood
Lady van Tassel caresses the man's chest, neck, face
trailing blood
The man lifts his head, in ecstasy, sucks the woman's bloody fingers
it's Clergyman Steenwyck
Ichabod backs away, having seen more than plenty
, '  -- Young Masbath unlocks the door
Ichabod enters
was getting worried
Who was it
Lady Van Tassel
What was she doing
Something  really wish  had not seen
Never mind it
Did you find the victims' loan agreements
No
They are all missing
This troubles Ichabod
There is more, though
While you were gone,  could hear someone else walking through the house
,   -- Ichabod and Young Masbath creep round a corner
Going to the , Ichabod crouches, eyes narrowing
(whispers, to himself) Katrina
The wax seal is broken, flecks of wax on the floor
,    -- Ichabod and Masbath come downstairs, checking all the wax marks
Young Masbath finds one broken
Here
Ichabod comes over, pushes the door
,  -- They enter
The kitchen is empty
Ichabod crosses to another door, crouches
Another broken wax mark
,   -- They enter
the room with the elaborate loom
Ichabod moves his lantern to make a quick search, goes to table
He touches the top of a candle
His finger comes away with a bit of still wet wax
There are no other doors
This is as far as she could have gone
It is nothing
She comes to read books, so her father will not find her
(to convince himself) It is absolutely nothing
What books
Fiction plays and novels
Baltus does not approve
Now, come
It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns
But, sir
what books
Where are they
Ichabod stops, looking around
No books anywhere
If there is a secret place for books
it could be just as good for the missing loan agreements
Ichabod ponders this without saying anything
,   -- : - Drawers are opened and searched, quietly
- Young Masbath uses a candle to look up the fireplace
- Ichabod opens a linen cabinet, unfolding blankets
- Young Masbath looks in a closet filled with big spools of sewing thread, on his knees, pulls a wooden box forward
Inside it, he finds only old cups and silverware
Ichabod pulls up a rug, feeling along the floorboards
Young Masbath crawls, doing the same
He climbs under the loom, tapping on the floor
He crawls further under the loom hollow sound
He taps again
Constable
Ichabod comes over as Young Masbath lifts a loose board
Under the floor, there are piles of books
Masbath brings them up, handing them to Ichabod, who studies the spines
Young Masbath reaches in up to his shoulder
He comes up with "
" Fie
Here they are
Ichabod takes them
Names are near the top: "Masbath," "Van Garret," "Philipse," and "Killian
" Ichabod sits back, numb, his heart bitterly broken
,  -- Lady Van Tassel prepares food with two servants at the open fireplace/oven
Ichabod enters, rushed
Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel
Katrina is not in her room
No
She has gone out
Where
She has taken the last of our grain to be milled
(crossing to him) You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable
Very little
must be going
Lady Van Tassel holds out her cut palm, the gash sewn shut
Will you look at this
cut my hand this morning:  sewed it myself, but am afraid it will go bad
Ichabod takes her hand, distracted and nervous
It appears well
It has already clotted
Look closer
Do you have anything to clean it with
It is fine
Now,  must
Lady Van Tassel grabs Ichabod by the wrist, tight
(whispering, close) know you saw me
What
Lady Van Tassel glances to servants, keeps her voice low
know you followed last night
You must promise not to tell Baltus
Ichabod tries to pull away, but she grips tighter
The is
Ichabod is panicky
Have mercy on me
Please
have mercy
Ichabod pulls away just as Baltus enters
Lady Van Tassel goes back to work as if nothing happened
Constable, it is urgent that we speak
-- Baltus leads Ichabod to the porch
Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting
This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse
How did you hear this
He came to me
He promised great violence
Said  should cast you out for my own protection
(troubled pause) must speak honestly
There is no reason to think he will not meet with success
Ichabod looks to barn, sees Masbath bringing the horses
The is   far away
That is the meeting bell already calling
With the murder of Killian and Brom, no one sees any good from you
If
if you were to leave
you might be saving your own life
Ichabod studies Baltus, then offers his hand
They shake
appreciate your concern
thank you, sir
Ichabod hurries off, across the lawn, exasperated
He runs
Masbath runs to him
Ichabod takes Gunpowder and climbs up
(mounting his horse) What now
Where is she
Things have become complicated
Katrina is at the mill
Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church
Find her at all costs
Quickly
They ride, fast
-- conjuring pile of straw burns
Gloved hands unfold a paper filled with clippings of human hair
The hair is sprinkled on the fire
cloaked  is kneeled at the pile
The figure turns to remove  human  from a cloth bag
The skull is placed at center in the flames
It's teeth are sharp, cut to points
The '
-- In the church yard refugee camp, food is prepared over fire
People inhabit the tents
, '  -- : it's crowded with families
Pews filled with bedding and belongings
Steenwyck comes to  the of his quarters, turning, angry
You are astonishing, Constable
Do you truly think your ridiculous accusations frighten me
Ichabod is doing nothing to hide his disdain
Only if  repeat them outside this room
And,  will if  must
(points to doors) Out there, for all to hear
Or
you may speak, as planned
But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures
No
You will not run me out
No one will believe a word of what you say
Oh
Far as  can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here
Are you a deist
Is that it
free thinker who does not believe in divinity
It is only important what you are
An adulterer
am the Lord's voice in this town
Wallowing in sin and lust
They need guidance
Wallowing quite literally in blood
(snapping, quaking) Damn you, sir
God damn you to hell
He may
But, not soon enough for you, and not on your behalf
Ichabod walks
Steenwyck is humiliated
You are so upset now
and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night
You cannot do this
am a man of God
Climb to the top of the tallest ladder you can find, Father
That is the closest you ever come to God
-- Pews are packed
Steenwyck enters, walks to the altar
Steenwyck has composed himself, barely
My friends
dear friends
Those of you still on your farms,  thank you for coming
He sees Ichabod near the back
is
address unfortunate business
(pause) am forced to take my leave from Sleepy Hollow
will be moving on to do the Lord's work elsewhere
The   shock
Ichabod walks out
-- Raining hard
Baltus and Lady Van Tassel ride
Hurry along
The meeting has most certainly already begun
We do not want Steenwyck as our enemy
Lady Van Tassel trails
is
Just off the road, a tree falls
The trunk catches Lady Van Tassel's horse on its rear flank
The horse falls
Lady Van Tassel hits the dirt
Baltus looks back, halting
Lady Van Tassel looks up to Baltus in fear, then turns
Behind her, the Headless Horseman trots from, the forest on Daredevil, stops
Calm
He takes his axe in hand
-- Storming
The meeting is letting out
Near the churchyard gate, Young Masbath rides with Katrina following on a horse cart
Ichabod walks up as Katrina dismounts
What is so urgent
Come with me
Ichabod leads her to where they can talk away from others
Why have  not seen your face for so long
You look much better
She touches his face, but he takes her hand, places the loan agreements there
Explain these
found them secreted away in the sewing room
Katrina's expression changes just so slightly to guilt
Why
why have  scrambled and run and clawed in all directions, only to find you against me
He stares at her
Katrina stares back, in a small way defeated
She looks for an out, but there is none
have been reading your journal
'm sorry
found it too fascinating to resist
(pause, ashamed) rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity
Before found you though,  overheard what you were said
It was you there
When
when you spoke father's name along with accusations,  could not believe it
had to hide these
at least till  could confront him myself
And, what did he say
He did not do these things
If you knew him, you would realize
What did he say, Katrina
have not been able to face him yet
The loans give the land to your father
It does not matter survivors are still on their farms
They could be thrown off
tomorrow
a year from now
Yes,  have seen that, and  told you why  hid them
What would you have me believe
(tiring, angry) If you think  am behind this, say it
The name Van Tassel is blackened
You share that name
Call me a liar, then, and a murderess
Say it, out and out
Many people are starting to notice the confrontation
Katrina
Speak the words, Constable
What is stopping you
What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality
Emotions tear at him
Rain seems to pound down harder
Oh, no
No
Please
don't dare stand looking as if you still care for me, after all that you have said
If  were to confess, would that ease your suffering
Would that make it easier for you to hate me
is
Baltus comes charging through the square on his horse
The Horseman is coming
He's barely hanging on
He stops, practically falling off, running towards Katrina and Ichabod
Save me
Father
He killed her
Baltus grasps Katrina, fearful
are
The Horseman has killed her
Far behind, the Horseman rides to follow, axe held up
Instant mayhem -- people scatter all directions, screaming
Baltus runs headlong to the church
Father
Katrina runs after Baltus
Ichabod backs away, watching the Horseman come, then heads to the church with Masbath
Baltus pushes through the iron gate, into tent city, joining the swarm of townsfolk pouring into the church
The Horseman rides behind, closing the gap
Men, women and children run for cover all along the square
Amidst the churchyard panic, Ichabod looks back
The Horseman reaches the open gate and Daredevil suddenly rears up, snorting, unwilling to enter
The Horseman grabs Daredevil's reins, tries to move forward again
Same result
Daredevil freaks out
-- Baltus makes his way in, shoving
People are still clamoring in through the doors
Men pass rifles from stockpiles and climb onto pews at boarded windows
Women herd children into a cellar
Baltus searches for a hiding place
He looks across the church to see Steenwyck closing the doors of his living quarters
Baltus moves
Steenwyck
At the front doors, Katrina squeezes in with Ichabod and Young Masbath just as people are forcing the doors closed
It's madness
People outside begin pounding
Katrina searches
Father
Ichabod goes to a window, looking out between boards
-- Across the yard, the Horseman gives his axe an underhand toss to the ground inside the gate
The  instantly      in the rain
The Horseman rides, keeping outside the fence
-- Ichabod comes away from the window, looking to panicked citizens
He sees Katrina moving up the aisle
She's heading towards Baltus, who slams against the door to Steenwyck's room
Damn you, Steenwyck
Help me
Let me in
as men at the windows begin firing
-- The Horseman circles, under fire
Great clouds of gun smoke shoot from the church
Men fire down from the belfry
Parts of the Horseman and Daredevil splatter red into the rain as slugs hit without effect
, the Horseman comes around, heading to the town square
-- Rifleman shout to each other, running to the opposite windows to follow the Horseman
Young Masbath grabs a rifle and leaps to join the brigade
Baltus is still beating Steenwyck's door when a grips Baltus angrily and throws him
You'll kill us all
Baltus falls, knocking over pews
Katrina's nearby
You're the one the Horseman wants
Why should we die for you
The huge farmer picks Baltus up, dragging him and shoving Katrina aside as she approaches
Ichabod's pushing past people, trying to reach them
/  -- The Horseman brings Daredevil to a halt, yanking a large coil of  off a hitching post
-- The huge farmer shoves Baltus to the floor again
Get out
Others join the rage, pulling Baltus towards the front of the church, shouting
Ichabod struggles to push them off
Stop this
Ichabod gets to Baltus' side, trying to protect
The Horseman cannot enter
It does not matter who he wants, he cannot cross the gate
At the windows,   turns, crying out
He's coming back
More panic
The huge farmer moves towards Baltus
We have to save ourselves
Baltus pulls the pistol from Ichabod's holster, brandishing
No
Get away from me
-- The Horseman rides past the front, fired upon
He halts at the wrought iron gate, reaching to yank off one which is pointed on top, like an arrow head
-- Baltus holds everyone's back with the pistol
The next person to lay hands on me will have a bullet
Stand off
Father
No
We're safe here
(points at Ichabod) You said it
The Horseman will not have me
, the harpoon-like post  through a window, trailing rope tied to it
--  Baltus from behind, the bloodied point bursting out his breast bone
Baltus looks down, drops the gun
clutching the post with both hands
Blood streams out his mouth
Katrina screams
The rope yanks Baltus back
He  into the
-- Baltus  out, hits the ground, dragged
Outside the fence, Daredevil runs with the rope tied around his saddle pommel
The Horseman strides forward, sword out
Baltus  the fence and the rope snaps
He is held there awkwardly, gurgling blood
The Horseman reaches Baltus
chops off his head
-- The storm has passed
Empty forest
Long, peaceful pause, till Ichabod makes his way through, searching the ground
Ichabod comes to look down a small hill
The corpse of Lady Van Tassel lies headless, in a dirty, torn dress
Ichabod walks to the body
Lady Van Tassel's arm is twisted behind
The sewn cut on the palm of her hand faces up
(shouting back) Here
have found her
(looking at corpse, quiet and miserable) Here she is
,   -- Doctor Lancaster comes out from where Katrina is asleep
He closes the door, wipes his sweaty face
Ichabod waits
It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves
You will stay at her side
Doctor Lancaster nods
Ichabod walks
-- It's getting dark
Ichabod comes out and crosses the porch
few of the Hollow's residents are here
Young Masbath gets up and follows Ichabod onto the lawn
Ichabod walks without waiting
She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir
Sir
(no answer) need time for thinking
Without you hanging on my coattails for a change
Ichabod keeps walking
Young Masbath stops, wounded
,     -- Ichabod stands holding a torch, looking up
The whole area is bright from the light off a giant fire
There are broken lanterns and barrels around the agonized, twisted tree
The tree is aflame, fire dancing up the trunk, and through every branch to lick the sky
-- Dawn
Ichabod is seated overlooking the Hudson
He stares at the beauty around him, brooding through bleary eyes
Gunpowder is tied to a tree
The ledger is open in Ichabod's lap
He thumbs pages absently, just keeps staring off
--  ( ) fire burns in a circle of rocks
Ichabod's ledger is thrown in
The pages catch quickly
Ichabod watches, then walks away
He's about to climb onto Gunpowder, but on second thought he opens his satchel and digs out a
He walks back to the fire, throws it on
"Romeo and Juliet
"  Flames devour it
,     -- The clearing is silent
The twisted tree still stands, smoldering, impressive as ever, or perhaps even more so with the alien appearance its blackened skin now affords it
, '  -- Ichabod packs up baggage
Young Masbath is miserable
Won't you change your mind, sir
What can  say to convince you
Nothing
To hell with this place and all the people here
Ichabod closes a bag, throws it with others
Why
why are you like this
(pause, softening) You do not know all that has happened
(pause) You cannot understand
-- coach, with Gunpowder as one of its team, waits in the orchard
Van Ripper comes to meet Ichabod and Masbath
Half now
Half when we reach the city
Ichabod hands Van Ripper money
Van Ripper takes the baggage
Ichabod looks to the Manor House
Only one light shines, in a second floor window
Katrina can be seen there a moment as she closes curtains
Ichabod turns to Young Masbath, who is beginning to cry
This is farewell
Take me with you
There's nothing left for me here
cannot
(bends to Masbath) You should not worry
(pause, sorrow) Van Ripper and his wife will look after you
They will
You will be well cared for
Young Masbath hugs
Ichabod hugs back, swallowing
am sorry
(quietly) Forgive me
failed you
Ichabod releases and goes quickly away, finding this misery unbearable
He climbs in the coach
Do not go, Constable
How can you leave
, Ichabod slumps back in darkness and closes his eyes
He pounds twice on the coach wall
, Van Ripper whips the reins
The coach starts
Young Masbath follows
The coach picks up speed on the long straight road
Young Masbath stops, wiping tears
/ -- Ichabod's coach moves through the town square
few people in the churchyard's tent city come out to watch it pass
, '  -- The door is pushed open
Young Masbath enters, looks around the empty room
He goes to sit in a chair at the work table, crossing his arms and resting his head
,   -- plate of food sits untouched
Katrina is slumped down in a chair, heartbroken, staring into the fireplace
Behind her, a shadow moves across the room
-- Van Ripper leads the coach through the stone pillars marking the entrance of Sleepy Hollow
'  -- Ichabod takes off his hat, sets it on the seat
The window between him and the driver slides open
Sir
this is yours
(offering something) The Van Tassel girl said to give it to you after you were gone
Ichabod takes it
It is the bird/cage spinning toy
He studies it
What melancholy
,   -- Katrina sits with her eyes closed
is She sits up
Suddenly, a  in black is behind her as she turns
-- a gloved fist strikes
, '  -- dull  is  downstairs, like a body falling
Young Masbath takes notice
He moves to the door
'  -- Ichabod turns the strings on the bird/cage toy, ponders it
The paper disk spins, images flickering until the bird appears to be inside the cage
Ichabod keeps spinning it, looks out the window
tear rolls down his cheek
The bird cage toy's rotation slows
stops
Ichabod looks at it a long moment, then pockets it and leans forward to the window at front
Ichabod's face appears behind Van Ripper
Van Ripper, turn the coach about
What did you say
Turn around
Now
,  -- Young	Masbath comes down the stairs, looking around meekly
Hello
Katrina
Masbath starts down a hall
He does not see, in another room, Katrina's body is dragged across the floor
, '  -- The coach comes to Lancaster's
Ichabod climbs out before it even stops fully, satchel in hand
He hurries
' ,  -- Doctor Lancaster, half asleep, comes to answer  on his door
Ichabod pushes past, taking Lancaster's lantern
Pardon the intrusion
' ,   -- Ichabod enters
There are two coffins on the floor
never examined these bodies
Ichabod removes the lid from one coffin
Lancaster is about to say something indignant, but then just looks disgusted
help yourself, you pompous ass
will be in bed
Would you stay, doctor
may need assistance
Lancaster reluctantly remains
Ichabod stares at the dead Lady Van Tassel
The neck wound is covered by a stained brown cloth, which Ichabod unwraps
Stains of blood
What of it
Ichabod takes out one of the lenses that survived the magnification spectacles, bends to examine the neck
Jagged flesh
(pause) The Horseman did not do this
Ichabod moves to the side of the coffin, lifting the hand with the stitched gash on its palm
Here, Doctor
Hold this just so
Lancaster holds the lens so that Ichabod can study the cut through it
Ichabod takes a scalpel-like knife from his satchel, lifts the hand and cuts stitches
: the gash spreads easily, soft, bloodless
No clotting or gathering of pus
No healing at all
What
When this cut was made, this person was already dead
(stands straight) This is not Lady Van Tassel
,  -- Young Masbath enters
The door swings shut
Katrina
(steps forward) Is anyone here
Behind him, the door  open -- Lady Van Tassel reaches to grab Young Masbath by the throat
/  -- Ichabod charges up to the church doors, pounding
Open the door
Open up, damn it
(pounds, shouting) Lady van Tassel is alive
The Horseman is her puppet
Please
The door opens and Huge Farmer points a rifle at Ichabod
Frightened people peer out from behind
Aren't we rid of you
Listen to me
Lady Van Tassel has faked her death
need able men
She's dead, and you have gone mad
No
(steps forward) Get out
Isn't it enough that you have ruined this town
Go
Ichabod backs away from the gun, frustrated, runs
At the ' , Van Ripper is still on the coach
Ichabod sprints over, breathless, taking out his pistol
Van Ripper
do you have a gun
Yes
Here
Van Ripper hold up a rifle
Ichabod holds out his hand
May  see it
Van Ripper's confused, but hands the rifle over
Ichabod immediately points his pistol at Van Ripper
Get down
Hurry
Van Ripper climbs off
Ichabod climbs up, whips the horses
Sorry
Van Ripper watches the coach leave, still with his hands up
-- In a wooded area, Katrina lies unconscious
Gloved hands reach to her hair and cut off a clump with
conjuring pile has been made, containing a small animal's heart with an iron nail through it
Katrina's hair is added and the pile is lit to burn
Nearby, Young Masbath watches, on his belly with his hands tied behind his back
Lady Van Tassel whispers over the fire, her white horse tied nearby
She looks to Katrina, who stirs
Lady Van Tassel takes the Horseman's skull from a bag over her shoulder, places the skull in the flames
is Lady Van Tassel looks up, smiles
,     -- The wind tosses leaves in swirls
The twisted tree opens wide, with a  -- shafts of light shooting out
-- Ichabod drives the coach hard ahead
-- Katrina sits up, groggy
Lady Van Tassel looks down at her
You
you are alive
Am
Or, are you and Young Masbath dead along with me
Katrina sees Young Masbath, and beyond him, the dying fire
She commands the Horseman
And, quite beautifully done, wouldn't you say
It is almost over
again
Wind starts to pick up
(of the wind) He rides tonight
Father saw you die
He saw me thrown
saw the Horseman looming over me as  fled
Things wanted him to see
But, as long as govern the Horseman, he cannot harm me
Baltus did not stay enough to see that
He ran as a coward, unfettered by my fate
Then, whose body was it
The precious servant girl Sarah killed her and kept her body hidden, till  needed it
And, when return to the Hollow tomorrow, my version of the truth will come to pass
(faking meekness) mean, there  was that fateful day, following Baltus into the woods did not know what he was up to
where he was going
worried for his safety
Katrina cautiously moves the hand she's supporting herself with, feels a rock and clutches it
Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant
girl who had apparently become his secret love
No one will believe your lies, whore
This whore will see your mouth shut forever very soon
But
am not going to kill you
Not me
She picks up the Horseman's skull in her gloved hand
He will have that honor
-- The Horseman rides Daredevil, a freight train of moldering flesh, heading towards a chasm with no bridge
They reach it, galloping in mid-air to the other side
/   -- Ichabod guides the coach into the Van Tassel orchard
-- Lady Van Tassel admires the skull
(mock sorrow) Woe is me
that spying on my husband in his filthy indiscretion,  saw he and Sarah attacked by the Horseman
Oh pity me
so overcome was  that wandered in the Western Woods
dazed
nearly blind from terror
Lady Van Tassel crouches, rubbing dirt on her face
And, tomorrow is my grand performance, having barely survived the elements
(more emoting) By sheer luck  found my way back to the Hollow
But
what do  find here
My dear, sweet step-daughter Katrina is dead
Why has God forsaken her
Seeing that Lady Van Tassel lavish attention on Katrina, Masbath takes this opportunity to ease onto his knees
(of herself, pleased) No one will suspect this sad woman who has been through such an ordeal
With only the empty solace of her money and land to comfort her
-- Ichabod leaps from the coach, bounds up the porch
Katrina
-- is
Lady Van Tassel turns, astonished
Murderer
Katrina slings the rock -- strikes Lady Van Tassel in the head, a glancing blow that knocks her down
Katrina runs
Katrina grips Young Masbath, helping him up
But, Lady Van Tassel scrambles up, grabs Katrina and throws her back to the ground
Lady Van Tassel steps hard on Katrina's ankle, touches her forehead, bleeding, pissed
You've been a naughty girl
Young Masbath leaps to action, charging head first -- slams into Lady Van Tassel, sends her backwards
Katrina runs and pulls Masbath up
They flee
Ichabod
Lady Van Tassel rolls, recovering, not very concerned
Little bitch
-- Ichabod comes out the open front doors
hearing
(o
s
) (far away) Ichabod
Ichabod climbs back on the coach, taking off

Ichabod
Here we are
, Lady Van Tassel rides her white horse, in no hurry
Wind kicks hard
are
Run, Katrina
Fast as your pretty legs will carry you
It makes no difference
, Ichabod drives towards Katrina and Masbath

Nothing will stop him now
At mid-field, Ichabod reaches Katrina and Masbath
Climb up
Lady Van Tassel
know
Hold on
With Katrina and Masbath on board, Ichabod turns the coach
Katrina unties Masbath's hands
Olly-olly oxen-free
Ichabod looks back towards Lady Van Tassel
At the treeline, the Horseman breaks into the open, hell on horseback
Full speed ahead
Christ
-- The coach hits the long straight road, away from the house
Katrina and Masbath hold on as the coach shakes violently
Where are we going
do not know
Away
Here he comes
Behind, the Horseman can be seen on the forest bordered road
Closing fast
Breakneck pace
We might make it to the church
Masbath takes a lantern, crawls back to the roof
Masbath
He ignores, reaching the rear of the coach and throwing the lantern at the Horseman
It smashes on the trail
Damn it, boy, get back here
Young Masbath slides back
Katrina helps him
What can we do
Take the reins
Young Masbath takes them
Ichabod slings Van Ripper's rifle over his shoulder and starts back
Katrina grips him
Masbath is right
We must do something
She releases
Ichabod gets to the luggage area at the rear, struggling to open a storage box
Behind, the Horseman draws his sword, closer
Ichabod opens the box, hefting out a long, jagged
Ichabod
Ichabod looks
The Horseman rides up, swinging
Ichabod recoils --  -- just missed by sword
The Horseman lets the coach get ahead, shifting to the other side of the trail
coming along side
Ichabod backpedals, looking to Masbath
Keep him off
Block him
Masbath guides the horses over
The Horseman must fall behind to avoid the wheels
The coach hits a large, fallen tree trunk
Ichabod bounces, falling
He hangs off the side of the coach
Katrina climbs to offer her hand
Ichabod offers the saw
Take it
Katrina takes the saw
Now with both hands, Ichabod tries for better purchase
He grips the coach door
It opens
Ichabod clings to the open door as branches slam him
He's reaching to the coach threshold, reaching
Ichabod pulls himself inside
-- the door hits a tree trunk, bashed to pieces
Ichabod looks out from the coach, dazed
He climbs
Katrina looks back as Young Masbath guides the coach to block the Horseman again
The Horseman sheaths his sword, riding
reaching to grip the back corner of the coach
The Horseman dismounts, clinging, climbing
Ichabod takes the rifle off his shoulder, aiming
-- splattering the Horseman's hand point blank
The Horseman hangs on with his other hand
The Horseman re-grips with the blasted hand, amazing since it's now all mush and bone
Ichabod throws the rifle on his way to the driver's perch, taking the saw from Katrina
Move forward
Katrina looks to the horses, then at Ichabod
Go
Ichabod takes the reins from Young Masbath
Help her
Reins in one hand and saw in the other, Ichabod waits
The Horseman rises up and moves in, taking out his sword
Young Masbath climbs down to the wooden pole connecting the coach to the bridles, puts out his hand
Katrina takes it
Behind, the Horseman swings
Ichabod blocks with the saw
Young Masbath guides Katrina as she leaps onto one horse
Bareback
Young Masbath straddles the horse beside her

He shoves off with his feet
The Horseman swings

The horses detach from the coach, dragging Ichabod along
The coach careens out of control
It flies off the trail, hits an incline and sails off, throwing the Horseman
The coach hits a tree trunk and
, the coach horses stop
Young Masbath and Katrina climb off as Ichabod gets to his feet, hurting, clutching his previously wounded shoulder
What now
doubt that's the end
The church
He moves too fast
Ichabod unhooks a lantern off the bridle rail
The trail behind is silent, till a bone chilling  is
What was that
His horse
They start moving
Ichabod looks around
He sees
There
Through the tree line, the Hollow's massive windmill can be seen against the sky
Katrina and Young Masbath run
-- Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath book into this open area, heading to the windmill
Another   echoes
Ichabod looks over his shoulder
Heavy, low hanging  and  at the forest edge creep to life, parting
forming a sort of black tunnel
He's coming
The Horseman gallops out, throwing leaves in his wake
Hurry
The Horseman readies a battle axe
Ichabod gets under the windmill, helping Young Masbath up the ladder and in
Katrina next
The Horseman is almost there
Ichabod follows Katrina
He gets in, feet dangling
The Horseman dismounts
-- Ichabod leaps up and struggles with the heavy trap door
slams it
He closes the latch just as the Horseman hits
The door buckles
It won't hold

The sword withdraws
begins
-- The Horseman chops at the door with his axe
-- The grindstone shifts
Katrina and Young Masbath back away
Ichabod holds his lantern up, desperate for ideas, searching
Above, to the right, is the milling platform, where grain is ground and bagged
To the left is the crooked staircase
Ichabod picks up a bailing hook, a plan forming
He gives his lantern to Katrina and points
Get up those stairs
Open the door to the roof and wait
Katrina and Young Masbath obey
Ichabod crosses and climbs the ladder to the milling platform
He grasps a wooden lever, pulling it
Gears above begin to turn
-- The windmill's rotors  to life, spinning
, the Horseman keeps chopping
His axe exposes grindstone, throwing sparks
-- Katrina looks down from the stairs
The Horseman's axe pries at the seam of the trap door
Ichabod
Keep climbing
will follow
Ichabod pulls bags of grain, lining them up at the edge of the milling platform
(under his breath) Hopefully
, Young Masbath reaches the ceiling, throws open the door to the roof
, Ichabod cuts holes into the grain bags, so milled grain spills out and falls to the floor, creating dust
He grabs one open bag and dumps it
More grain dust
-- Masbath and Katrina come out
Rotors spin behind them
-- Ichabod sees below
the Horseman sticks a hand through, trying to push the grindstone aside, then withdrawing
The axe continues
Won't be long
Ichabod grabs one half-full bag of grain, swings it with effort, throws
The bag smashes on the grindstone, busting the door
-- The grindstone falls through,  the Horseman down
-- Ichabod slices into a sack hanging from a pulley system
More and more dust rises
Below, the Horseman enters
Katrina shouts from above
Look out
The Horseman moves toward the ladder milling platform ladder, but Ichabod grabs it, pulling it up
The Horseman just misses the final rung
Ichabod throws the ladder aside as the Horseman backs off
Ichabod looks to the staircase
No way to climb down from the milling platform and get there
The Horseman runs and leaps, grabbing a hanging chain
The Horseman climbs the chain, swinging
Ichabod runs across the platform, jumps
Ichabod grasps the frail rail of the staircase, barely
The rail creaks, about to break
Behind, the Horseman lands on the milling platform
Ichabod is losing grip
Young Masbath races down the stairs, grabs his hand
He pulls Ichabod up
Ichabod's pistol slips from its holster and falls
Ichabod and Young Masbath look
The Horseman, following Ichabod's lead, runs across the milling platform and leaps
Grabs the staircase rail, only a few feet from Ichabod and Masbath
Ichabod kicks the rail, breaking it
The Horseman falls in billowing dust, crashing below
Ichabod pushes Masbath up the stairs
-- Katrina helps them onto the roof
Quickly, close it
No
(takes lantern, points) Get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump
Jump
Jump where
-- The Horseman runs, agile, up stairs
-- Ichabod shepherds Katrina and Young Masbath to the edge where the rotors spin close
The blades will carry us to the ground
Face front and wait for me
can't do this
We have no choice
Ichabod moves back to the trap door
Katrina and Young Masbath look at the rotors, and down at the long distance between them and the ground
Be ready
Ichabod throws the lantern into the windmill and runs
Now
-- The Horseman continues up
The lantern falls past
,  -- Young Masbath jumps
Ichabod grips Katrina and jumps
They hit one rotor and cling to the frame and cloth
The rotor begins its downwards swing
-- The lantern hits the ground and shatters
Grain dust is consumed instantaneously -- upwards, filling the windmill
Engulfing the Horseman
-- The rotor is halfway to its lowest point
Masbath, Katrina and Ichabod hang on as the entire structure trembles
-- flames shoot out the windows, doors and seams, lighting up the night
On the rattling rotor, Ichabod struggles to hold the frame with one hand and keep a grip on Katrina
Masbath drops
Ichabod releases Katrina, then drops
They hit the ground
Ichabod rolls, gasping, holding his shoulder
They all look at each other in disbelief a moment
Ichabod lets out a sort of rasping laugh, standing
Okay
come on
Ichabod ushers them across the field, uphill
Running
Lightning flashes across the sky
bolt strikes the windmill, and it
The rotors bust apart
Splinters of burning wood spin all directions
, Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath keep running
There is a   parked ahead
, the Horseman rises, shoving off burning debris
His flame-ravaged uniform smolders
, Ichabod stumbles onwards, but notices something horrible
In the distance, Lady Van Tassel's white horse roams free
(as this registers) Oh, no
Young Masbath and Katrina are just past the cart when Lady Van Tassel rises from behind it, swings a plank
Ichabod in the chest and sends him down
Lady Van Tassel grabs Katrina's hair, drags her
Should have stayed away, Constable
Ichabod gets up slow, furious, reaches to his holster, only to find it empty
He moves forward
Keep back, or  kill her
She takes out scissors, holds them to Katrina's neck
Katrina ceases struggling
Ichabod keeps Masbath behind him, keeps his distance
Lady Van Tassel shoots a glance
See him
Par off, the Horseman strides from the wreckage
You cannot kill what is already dead
Let her go
Yes
yes
think  will
Lady Van Tassel spins and throws Katrina in the cart, shoving against it
No
The cart rolls downhill
Ichabod moves forward
Lady Van Tassel turns, brandishing the scissors, slashing and missing
Ichabod backs off
, the cart picks up speed, headed for the Horseman
The Horseman starts running to meet it
, Lady Van Tassel grins
Say goodbye to her
Lady Van Tassel lunges, stabbing
Ichabod avoids, puts all his fury behind his fist -- punches her in the face
Lady Van Tassel hits the ground and her bag falls open, sending the Horseman's skull rolling out
The skull rolls
rolls
landing far away
, Katrina leaps out from the cart
She lands hard
The Horseman shoves the empty cart aside, still on the move
, Ichabod sees the skull
He runs towards it
Lady van Tassel grabs Ichabod by the ankle
He falls
, Katrina runs back
The Horseman is catching up
, Ichabod tries to pull f ree from Lady Van Tassel
Young Masbath comes behind her -  - hits her in the head with the wooden plank
She's out
Ichabod scrambles to his feet
, the Horseman catches Katrina, taking her by the hair as she falls to her knees and screams
, Ichabod runs
grasps the Horseman's skull
He runs towards the Horseman and Katrina
, Katrina struggles, but the Horseman holds her ready by her hair
raises his sword
, Ichabod throws the skull
Horseman
The skull spins through the air
The Horseman drops Katrina, reaches up
Catches the skull
Katrina runs
Ichabod runs to meet her, grabs her as she falls, exhausted
Together, they back away from the Horseman
The Horseman holds the skull out, then brings it to his shoulders, to its rightful place
begins -- blood and flesh rise up from the Horseman's throat and grip the skull
Young Masbath drops the plank, watching in awe
The Horseman's reformation continues
Muscle forms
Liquids become solids
He is made whole once more, the same evil, human face we saw in Baltus' stories
He looks to Ichabod and Katrina, touches his restored face
Daredevil rides up,
The Horseman replaces his sward and climbs into the saddle
He rides towards Katrina and Ichabod, but passes them by
They are so exhausted they fall down
Young Masbath backs up as the Horseman comes, but the Horseman does not want him either
The Horseman leans to grab Lady Van Tassel's unconscious form, pulls her up across Daredevil's back
He rides away with her
Ichabod and Katrina watch him go
They look at each other, then kiss gratefully
Ichabod looks to Young Masbath
How are you
Tired
Ichabod smiles and holds out his arm
Masbath comes over
Group hug
Lightning brightens the farmland around them
,   -- The Horseman enters the clearing, keeping a hand on Lady Van Tassel
Ahead, the twisted tree awaits
Lady Van Tassel is awakening, face bloody
She turns her head and looks forward
She screams
The twisted tree's wound opens, wide and glowing
Daredevil picks up speed
Daredevil leaps just as a lightning bolt blasts down, striking the Horseman
For an instant, Horseman and horse are transformed, , entering the tree
Silence and smoke
At the tree, Lady Van Tassel's hand sticks out from the tight-shut suture
The sewn wound on her palm seeps blood
, '  -- bright, busy day in New York
coach pulls up to Ichabod's home
Ichabod is the driver
He gets off, goes and opens the coach door
He helps Katrina down
Next, Young Masbath sticks his head out
Ichabod goes about unloading bags
Katrina holds Young Masbath's hand, and they look down the street in wonder
