hand presses a cassette into a recorder and fiddles with a small microphone
Malloy sits over a table fiddling with the tape
He is young, half-shaven, dressed in -shirt and jeans
He looks too - , who stands by the window, looking out on the street, with his back to Malloy
Louis is dressed in an old-fashioned suit
So you want me to tell you the story of my life
That's what  do
interview people
collect lives
radio
just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who - (quietly interrupting) You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story
've had a very unusual life
So much the better
've got a pocket full of tapes
You followed me here, didn't you
Saw you in the street outside
You seemed interesting
Is this where you live
It's just a room
So shall we begin
(playfully, almost teasing) What do you do
'm a vampire
Malloy laughs
See
knew you were interesting
You mean this literally,  take it
Absolutely
was watching you watching me
was waiting for you in that alleyway
And then you began to speak
Well, what a lucky break for me
Perhaps lucky for both of us
Still in shadow he turns from the window and approaches the table
'll tell you my story
All of it
'd like to do that very much
Malloy is uneasy as he studies the shadowy figure, fascinated but afraid
You were going to kill me
Drink my blood
Yes but you needn't worry about that now
Things change
Louis stands opposite, hand on the chair
Malloy is riveted
You believe this, don't you
That you're a vampire
You really think
We can't begin this way
Let me turn on the light
But  thought vampires didn't like the light
We love it
only wanted to prepare you
Louis pulls the chord of the overhead naked light bulb
' Appears inhumanly white, eyes glittering
Inhuman or not alive
the effect is subtle, beautiful and ghastly
Good God
He struggles to suppress fear and understand
Don't be frightened
want this opportunity
The light appears to go out by itself and suddenly Louis is in the chair, dimly lit by the street-light from the window
The cassette is turning
How did you do that
The same way you do it
series of simple gestures
Only  moved too fast for you to see
'm flesh and blood, you see
But not human haven't been human for two hundred years
Malloy is speechless, frightened yet enthralled
What can  do to put you at ease
Shall we begin like David Copperfield
am born,  grow up
Or shall we begin when  was born to darkness, as  call it
That's really where we should start, don't you think
You're not lying to me, are you
Why should  lie
1791 was the year it happened
was twenty-four - younger than you are now
Yes
But times were different then was a man at that age
The master of a large plantation just south of New Orleans
: -  (1791) disheveled Louis, hair in pigtail, in deep pocket frock coat, rides his horse through the fields of indigo, passing an overseer and slaves at work
He passes slave quarters and the distant colonial mansion of Pointe du Lac
He comes to a small parish church and a graveyard
he dismounts and walks through the tombs to an elaborate one in Greek Style
(
) had just lost my wife in childbirth
She and the infant had been buried less than half a year
There is a marble angel above the tomb, feminine, with a tiny cherub angel in her arms
Louis looks from the angel, down to the inscriptions on the tomb: "     1763 - 1791 - 1791" Louis rips away the vines already covering the inscription, then drinks from a pocket-flask
His face is ashen
(
) was twenty-four and life seemed finished
couldn't bear the pain of their loss
longed for a release from it
- Louis in ragged lace and dirty brocade sitting between two whores at a gaming table, drinking absinthe
All around him flatboatmen, whores, gamblers, black African freedmen
(
) wanted to lose everything
My wealth, my estate, my sanity
But Lady Luck didn't oblige
Louis displays a hand of four aces
gambler at the table stands in fury, over turning money, cards, drinks
You're calling me a cheat
'm calling you a piece of shit - The Gambler pulls out a pearl-handled pistol and points it at Louis
The crowd hushes and draws back
Louis smiles drunkenly and stands
he rips open his lace shirt, exposing his chest
Then do me a favor
Get rid of this piece of shit
The Gambler's finger on the trigger
His hand shakes
You lack the courage of your convictions, sir
Do it
, a hooded figure in the corner, smiles from beneath the shadow of his hood
Gleaming blue eyes
(
) Most of all  longed for death know that now
invited it, a release from the pain of living
The Gambler lowers his gun, scowling
Louis pockets the fistfulls of coins he has won
- Loud, crowded riverfront taverns full of ruffians
Louis staggers down, an arm around a whore, drinking from a bottle
pockmarked pimp follows behind
My invitation was open to anyone
Sailors, thieves, whores and slaves
- Louis, quite insensible, being propped up against a wall by the whore in a dank wharf over the water
The pimp rifles his pockets, then pulls a knife, about to slice his throat, when a shadow falls over him
He turns, and we see the face of Lestat, who lifts him into the air by his throat, breaking his neck
the whore screams and Lestat's other hand clamps over her mouth
Lestat drags her towards him
Louis falls to the ground, supported no more, insensible
Close on his face, as we hear the last breaths of life of the whore, off
(
) But it was a vampire that accepted
The bodies of the thief and whore float by
Above on the wharf, Louis, now awake, stares down at them
He turns, to see Lestat, towering above him
They would have killed you - Then my luck would have changed
You want death
Is it death you want
Yes
Lestat floats down on top of him, then lifts him in the air, draws his head back by the hair and sinks his teeth in his neck
' Every muscle rigid, teeth clenched, as the blood is drained from him
Hovering above the ground, like two quivering dancers
billows through the ghostly white sails and rigging of the boats around the wharf
Floats higher, with Louis in his arms, draining his blood
One hand reaches out and grips a rope, hanging from a shipmast
The other holds Louis
He withdraws his teeth, and looks into Louis' drained face
You still want death
Or have you tasted it enough
Louis can barely get the words out
Enough
Lestat smiles and lets him go
Louis falls and plummets into the water below
' Coming to the surface, in the water lapping by the wharf
The bodies of the whore and thief float beside him
He looks up and sees Lestat way above him, dangling from the rope of the shipmast
- ' Captivated, terrified, enthralled
That's how it happened
No
The Gift of Darkness requires more than that, as you'll see
- Louis floating by mudflats, surrounded by dead fish, the carcasses of animals, eighteenth century rubbish
He gets to his feet and walks weakly through the mudflats
The sun is coming up over the sea behind him
(
) He left me half dead that morning
he wanted something from me
He came back the following night
- Louis is delirious in a four-poster bed, shrouded with mosquito netting
female slave, , bathes his face with a rag
She is crying
Other slave women hover in the shadows
Yvette puts out all candles save one by the bed, and withdraws, with the others
Candlelight flickers on the face of the bisque virgin
Louis tosses and turns, dreaming, murmuring incoherently
Then he opens his eyes
, exquisitely dressed in French clothing, stands by the bed smiling
In the light of the candle we see that he is not human; skin too white; eyes too bright
Lestat looks amiable, even mischievous, but impossible - and angel or monster
Louis grabs his pistol from the table and cocks it
Who the hell are you
What are you doing in my house
And a beautiful house it is too
Yours is a good life, isn't it
Louis takes aim
Lestat puts his hand over the barrel
Louis fires
The bullet tears a hole in Lestat's hand
Lestat is unfazed
He takes the gun from Louis' hand and throws it away
His hand begins to heal
You're not afraid of anything, are you
Why should  be
Louis reaches for his sword, hanging by the bed, and point it
Lestat laughs indulgently
He draws closer
Are you going to put that through me too
Ruin my beautiful clothes
He comes closer to Louis, right up to his face, so the sword passes through his waistcoat
Were all last night's promises for nothing
He reaches out with his now-healed hand and plucks out the sword
What do you want from me
've come to answer your prayers
You want to die, don't you
Life has no meaning anymore, does it
Lestat sits down on the bed, drawing up one knee
Louis is becoming spellbound
The wine has no taste
The food sickens you
There seems no reason for any of it, does there
But what if  could give it back to you
Pluck out the pain and give you another life
And it would be for all time
And sickness and death could never touch you again
The vampire theme rises, with the sound of a heartbeat
: - The camera drifts through the graveyard where Louis' wife is buring
Everything is lit with an eerie glow, as if seen through some unearthly eye
Vampires, that's what we are
Creatures of darkness, only we see it that darkness more clearly than any mortal has ever seen
Louis and Lestat drifting, dreamlike, through the overhanging vines, comes to the grave of his wife and child
Above the crypt, the statue of angel, mother and child
Wouldn't it be sweet to bid pain goodbye
To wave away anguish and grief
To embrace the peace of the unending night
The marble fingers of the child on the statue move
The angel raises her head and has the face of Louis wife, Diane
she raises her hand and touches Louis tear- streamed face
The child speaks
Papa
Louis reaches out to embrace them and finds himself touching cold marble
He cries out in anguish- Diane
They are gone, Louis
Death took them
Death which you can now destroy
- Louis, thrashing on the bed in a delirium
Lestat places a hand on his forehead and soothes him
You have to ask me for this
You have to want it, do you hear me
Give it to me
Vampires
We thrive on blood
want it
Lestat bends close as if to drink Louis' blood
Louis does not shrink back, but stares into his eyes
Lestat draws back, then stands up and goes to the French doors
Tomorrow night
You must prove yourself
will give you the choice  never had
He looks outside
The sun's coming up
Watch it carefully
If you come with me tomorrow, you'll never see it again
He leaves
Louis sits dazed, staring at the empty French window
The sun rises with unnatural beauty, over the swamplands and the plantation, filling the room, striking water-pitcher, glass, mirror, and the picture of his dead wife
(
) My last sunrise
That morning  was not yet a vampire, and  saw my last sunrise
remember it completely, yet  don't remember any sunrise before it
watched the whole magnificence of the dawn for the last time, as if it were the first
And the  said goodbye to sunlight and went out to become what  became
- Lestat and Louis walk through the slave quarters, huddles groups around fires, music, singing
The sound of whipping is heard
Your grief has unhinged you
You've let your estate rot
In the woods beyond the quarters, the white overseer is whipping a black slave, with horrifying savagery
You let your overseer run riot, work your slaves to the bone
We'll start with him
How do you mean, start
Call him
Louis calls
Carlos
The overseer turns and comes towards them, with the bloodied whip
Why the bloody whip, Carlos
The overseer looks into his eyes, shivers with terror, drops the whip and runs for the trees
Lestat is on him in an instant
He sinks is teeth in his neck
Louis runs to him, tries to pull him off
But Lestat turns to Louis and smiles, with his bloodied mouth
Let's call that a start
can't do it
You've just done it - Kill me if you will, but  can't do this
He flees, as Lestat ends to finish off the overseer
- Louis running up the steps leading to the gallery
He is crazed with guilt
He looks up and sees - Sitting collected at the head of the steps
Backs away as Lestat rises and descends the steps so fluidly he hardly seems to move
Don't worry
He was white trash, they come at two a penny
dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean
You're the devil, aren't you
That's who you are
(gently) wish  were
But if  were, what would  want with you
can't go through with it,  tell you
Your perfect
Your bitter and you're strong
But why do you want me
Because you're as strong as  was when  was alive
Louis takes out his flask and drinks
Drunkenly, he turns and heads for a nearby swamp
- Louis stops again in front of the crypt
Drinks from the flask, leans his forehead against the stone
Lestat appears beside him, radiant, beautiful
You really want to be with them
Yes
Kill me
Kill me like you promised - You asked for death
didn't promise it - In a quiet rage, Lestat raise his fist and shatters the marble face stone, revealing a coffin below
His fist shatters that in turn, revealing the half-rotted body of a women, holding an infant, no longer recognizable as individuals, a tangle of gruesome rotted hair, flesh, eaten away lace, insects and worms crawling over it
Louis gasps
It's not your wife and child my friend
It's death
Just that simple
Think and choose
It happens to everyone
Except us
Lestat stares at him, smiling, becoming a hazy dreamlike vision, then hyperclear
Louis again is spellbound
He drops the flask, which shatters on the stones
Lestat appears angelic in his radiance
We shall be this way always, my friend
Young as we are now
'm lonely for a companion, lonely for your strength
But 'm not that lonely
Do you want to come or not
Louis capitulates in one long sigh
Yes
Lestat comes closer, smiling
Did  hear a yes
Yes
Lestat embraces Louis, obscuring his face
He drinks his blood
We hear two heartbeats, out of sync, coming together
We see Louis' face, growing paler, paler, as his blood is drained
His eyes stare upwards, losing their focus
' The moon, through hanging vines
The marble statue of his wife and child smile at him, as if come alive
Her hair blows in the breeze, wonderful gold tresses, the child's fingers reach out
Lestat lets Louis fall down beside the broken crypt
Louis looks from the rotting bodies to Lestat above him
radiant
Lestat speaks gently
've drained you to the point of death
If you drink from me you live for ever
If  leave you here you die
Lestat lifts his hand to his lips and blows Louis a kiss
No
Don't leave me here
Give it to me
Lestat lifts his own right wrist to his teeth
Fangs slash his own flesh, blood falls
You're sure
Sure
Louis rises to accept the first drops with his open mouth
Lestat gathers him up, as Louis clamps his hand on Lestat's arm and drinks from the wrist
The   swells
Lestat watches him drink his wrist with wry amusement
Louis finishes, staggers away from him as if drunk
' Vampire vision
The world is transformed, the swamp, the moon, the clouds, the cry of the night birds all come to him with unnatural clarity
He looks down with pity at the corpses of his wife and child who appear beautiful in death now rather than repulsive
He closes the lid of the coffin and replaces it in the ground, astonished at the ease of it
He turns and stares at Lestat whom he sees now with vampire's vision
Lestat's eyes are brighter, his buttons are glimmering in the light
Everything is clearer, brighter, containing more facets of light and color
Stop staring at my buttons
Didn't tell you it was going to be fun
Lestat leads him into the swamp
Everything astonished Louis, as if he's never seen it before
Louis is suddenly racked by shudders of pain
You're body's dying
Pay no attention
It will take twenty minutes at most
Dying
Louis dry-retches
It happens to us all
Lestat wipes Louis' brow
Come, you're going to feed now
want a woman
Lestat laughs and his laughter echoes like bells in Louis' ears
That doesn't matter anymore, Louis
You'll see
Come
'   - Small high ground
Camp of runaway slaves
Several share a bottle of rum around the fire
male slave rises
gorgeous hunk of flesh in the moonlight and goes into the swamp to relieve his bladder
They're all beautiful now
Men, women, the old, the young
simply because they are alive
- The slave walks towards them in the darkness crucifix gleams round his neck
Take him
The crucifix - Forget the crucifix
Take him
Louis hesitates
Resist no more Louis
Feed
The slave looks up and sees them
Two gleaming white beings standing before him with devil's eyes
The he runs
Louis can resist him no more
He swoops on him with a vampire's rapid movement, brings him to the ground and sinks his teeth in his neck
Close on Louis feeding on the slave, the magnificent body shuddering in its death-throes
Lestat stands above, laughing
The slave dies
Louis rises from him, drunkenly, engorged with blood
What have  done
You have fed
You were made for this
Louis looks down at the body of the slave
Lestat's laughter echoes around him
Dear God, what have  done
You've killed Louis
And enjoyed it
Lestat laughs harder
Louis runs from him, screaming in anguish
- Louis reaches his wife's grave
He falls to his knees, throws back his head and bares his new fangs to the moon
Dear God, what have  become
- Malloy stares at Louis, terrified and enthralled
You said the slave had a crucifix
Oh, that rumor about crosses
You can't look at them
Nonsense, my friend
can look on anything  like
And  am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes
The story about stakes through the heart
The same
As you would say today
Bull shit
What about coffins
Coffins
coffins unfortunately are a necessity
- Louis walks up the steps to the mansion
He looks now like a fully-fledged vampire
Yvette, the slave girl stares at him from the open doorway
Cascades of harpsichord music come from the interior
(
) Killing is no ordinary act
It is the experience of another's life for certain
That night  had lost my own life and taken another's was drowning in a sea of human guilt and regret, with all the heightened senses of a vampire
Louis enters the mansion, following the harpsichord music, as if in a dream
Yvette draws back as he approaches
- Louis wanders into the parlor, where Lestat is playing the harpsichord rapidly and exuberantly
Louis goes to a full-length mirror and sees his own reflection there - quite the perfect vampire
Yes, that's you, my handsome friend
And you'll look that way till the stars fall from heaven
It can't be
Give it time
You're like a man who loses a limb and still imagines he feels pain
It will pass
And we must sleep now
can feel the sun approaching
Dawn spreading over the plantation
- brick walled storage room
Two coffins stand on the floor
Lestat enters with a lantern, Louis behind
Lestat is apprehensive and protective of Louis
He pulls back one lid ot reveal a satin interior
You must get into it
It's the only safe place for you when the light comes
And if  don't
The sun will destroy the blood 've given you
Every tissue, every vein
The fire in this lantern could do that too
Louis approaches the coffin, hands trembling as he peers into it
Don't be afraid
In moments you'll be sleeping as soundly as you ever slept
And when you awake 'll be waiting for you, and so will all the world
Louis crawls into the coffin, fearful yet fascinated
You told me something earlier
You said you didn't have a choice
Was that true
Lestat smiles bitterly and nods
Someday 'll tell you
We have a lot of time to talk to each other
You might say
we have all the time we shall ever need
He closes the lid
Total darkness
Sounds of Louis' panicked breathing
Of his prayer again
Dear God, what have  done
- Louis and Lestat sitting at a sumptuous table, piled with uneaten food
Lestat is going through sheafs of documents
(
) awoke the next evening to a different world
And  realized there are as profound differences between vampires as between human beings
Lestat, totting up figures on a piece of paper
Your wealth, dear Louis, is inestimable
Your income from cotton alone will keep us in comfort for a century
Louis just stares at him
(
) sat there staring at him with contempt
He had the soul of a shopkeeper, he was the sow's ear out of which nothing fine could be made
felt sadly cheated in having him as a teacher
Lestat looks up at him and grins
You'll get used to killing
Just forget about that mortal coil
You'll become accustomed to things all too quickly
Do you think so
Yvette enters, stands behind him, staring at Lestat with loathing
You are not hungry, sir
Au contraire, my dear
He could eat a horse
Lestat laughs loudly
Louis turns and looks at Yvette
Her beautiful forehead in the candlelight, the veins pulsing on her neck and her hands
(
) looked at anything mortal and saw all life as precious, condemning all fruitless guilt and passion that would let it slip through the fingers like sand
Yvette returns his stare, troubled
(
) It was only as a vampire that could see Yvette's beauty
Her fear of me increased my desire
Yvette reaches for his uneaten plate
Louis stops her hand
Holds it for a beat too long, looking at the veins in her wrist
will finish it, Yvette
Now leave us
She turns and runs from the table
Lestat leans towards him
Can't you pretend, you fool
Don't give the game away
We're lucky to have such a home
His hand snakes out under the table
It comes up holding a large grey rat
Pretend to drink, at least
He bares his fangs and slices the rat's throat
He pours the blood into a crystal glass
Such fine crystal shouldn't go to waste
He hands the glass to Louis
Louis drinks the blood and stares at it in surprise, then at the dead rat on the fine lace tablecloth
know
It gets cold so fast
We can live like this
Off the blood of animals
Lestat shrugs
wouldn't call it living
'd call it surviving
useful trick if you're caught for a month on a ship at sea
Lestat strokes the belly of the dead rat, studying it sadly
There's nothing in the world now that doesn't hold some
Fascination
Yes
And 'm bored with this prattle - He throws the rat away
But we can live without taking human life
It's possible
Anything is possible
But just try it for a week
Come into New Orleans and let me show you some real sport
He rises
Louis follows
- big, lavish drinking place with a raised stage
Italian actors in buffoonish costumes act crude commedia dell'arte on the stage
Plantation owners in soiled brocade, lace, crooked wigs watch the show as tavern wenches move about
(
) This was New Orleans, a magical and magnificent place to live
In which a vampire, richly dressed might attract no more notice in the evening than hundreds of other exotic creatures
Louis and Lestat by a table, in the shadow of a tree
Teresa, a tavern wench, sits on Lestat's lap, pouring drinks for the two of them
She lifts a fresh glass to Lestat's lips as he flirts with her
Come on, mon cher
The best in the colony
Once you touch this you'll never go to any other tavern again
You think so, cherie
But what if 'd rather taste your lips
My lips are even sweeter still
She kisses him
He lets his tongue play with hers, then runs it down her neck
She swoons with pleasure
Then he sinks his teeth gently in her neck, looking playfully behind at Louis, who if appalled and fascinated
Laughter rocks the tavern
Lestat slips the pale and dead Teresa into a chair beside him and folds her hands on the table
No one notices
He lays gold coins on the table and touches Louis' knee
Let's get out of here
Lestat rushes out, thrilled with himself
- crowded street
Louis and Lestat emerge from the tavern
Louis looks up at the moon
Have you ever been caught
Of course not
It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them
They walk down the crowded night street, full of ladies in their finery, freed slaves, whores, sailors etc
(
) Lestat killed two, sometimes three a night
fresh young girl, that was his favorite for the first of the evening
- Small orchestra plays for colonial couples in fine wig and garb prancing to a French minuet
Young women sit in chairs along the walls with their chaperones
Young men stand opposite
(
) But the triumphant kill of Lestat was a young man
They represented the greatest loss to Lestat because they stood on the threshold of the maximum possibility of life
youth of preternatural beauty, silhouetted against French windows
He is talking to an elegant widow, seated, holding two manicured poodles
Lestat stares at the youth with longing
The trick is not to think about it
See that one
The widow St
Clair
she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband
She's perfect for you
Go ahead
But how do you know
Read her thoughts
can't
The dark gift is different for each of us
But one thing is true of everyone
We grow stronger as we go along
He leads Louis closer to them
Take my word for it
She blamed a slave for his murder
And do you know what they did to him
He smiles at the young man, who smiles in return
The evildoers are easier
And they taste better
- Lestat walks the youth towards a copse of trees
He looks back at Louis, who holds both poodles on a delicate leash, walking with the widow
The minuet spills from the french windows
Now, young man, you really amaze me
'm old enough to be your grandmother
She leans towards him concquettishly
Louis, crazed with hunger, sees her as beautiful in the moonlight
He allows her lips reach his
He takes her in his arms, gently, romantically, and sinks in his teeth
She swoons
Yes, that's the melody,  remember it
Oh yes
Louis draws his lips away
She is weak in his arms, but still alive
He can't do it
The poodles growl
He shoots out an arm and grabs one, then the other
- Lestat, bending over the body of the dead youth scream pierces the night
Murder
Murderer
The widow on the grass, her poodles dead beside her
Louis is trying to quiet her
My little papillions
My butterflies
He killed them
Lestat comes from nowhere, claps a hand over her mouth and breaks her neck
He spits in fury at Louis
You whining coward of a vampire who prowls the night killing rats and poodles
You could have finished us both
Louis throws himself on Lestat with extraordinary force, pummeling him towards the trees
What have you done to me
You've condemned me to hell
don't know any hell - Louis hurls him against tree after tree with a strength he never knew he had
You want to see me kill
Watch me kill you then - He drags him to the ground an throttles him
Lestat looks up at him, amazed and amused at the same time
What strength, my friend, what strength
remember why  chose you now
Lestat squirms from his grip, seemingly effortlessly
But you can't kill me, Louis
Nor you
He ruffles Louis' hair, with wry affection
Feed on what you want, mon cherie
Rats, chickens, doves, goats
'll leave you to it and watch you come round
Just remember, life without me would be even more unbearable
He smiles
sly, pleasurable secret secret smile
- Their carriage draws up to the mansion as the first fingers of light spread across the sky
(
) Being a vampire to him meant revenge
Revenge against life- itself
Every time he took a life it was revenge
and the slaves with a wisdom that was denied their masters, began to notice
- - In a tiny cabin, a slave family
Kids sleeping on the floor, in cribs and cots
The parents sleep on the bed, young, beautiful, naked
Beside them is Lestat, who is drinking the husband's blood, his hand playing across the breast of the wife as he does so
She murmurs in her sleep
Yes
please
She grabs his fingers and kisses them, thinking him to be her husband
Lestat gently disengages himself and leaves
- - The woman's scream pierces the sky, as Lestat walks into the night
- - Every chicken is dead, bloodies necks hanging down from the cribs
Louis emerges from the entrance, blood on his lips
He hears the scream
- The sound of drumming is heard, African, primal
The woman runs through the quarters, screaming grief
Others gather at doorways, restrain and console her
- - beautiful, elaborate eighteenth century dove-cote
Every dove inside is dead, pierced at the neck
black hand throws in a flaming torch and it bursts into flame
- doll, made in the image of Lestat, is pierced with needles
- Bodies of slaves floating in the swamp, with the bodies of goats
Slaves at the edge throw ropes around the bodies, pull them towards the shore
The drumming grows louder
- - Louis walking through
The slaves hush as he approaches, gather in doorways and whisper
He turns and looks at them, sorrowfully
He looks truly like a ghost
Their eyes turn away when they meet his
He walks on
- Lestat and Louis sit at the table, the untouched food between them
Consider yourself lucky
In Paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons
Here all one needs is a pair of fangs
Paris
You came from Paris
As did the one who made me
Tell me about him
You must have learnt something from him
It had to happen for you as it did for me
learnt absolutely nothing wasn't give a choice, remember
But you must know something about the meaning of it all, you must know where we come from, why we
Lestat spits out in anger
Why
Why should  know these things
Do you know them
The drumming grows outside
(gripping his temples) That noise
It's driving me mad
We've been in the country for weeks, with nothing but that noise
They know about us
They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses
Come the New Orleans then
There's an opera on tonight
real french opera
We can dine in splendor
respect life, don't you see
For each and every human life  have respect
Respect me a little then
'm the only life you know
Louis stares
Lestat turns childishly, petulantly
You'll soon run out of chickens, Louis
He walks out, humming a French aria
Louis stares at his plate
- The slaves, gathered on mass around fires
Frenzied drumming, dancing
Lestat rides through, scattering the flames
The drumming stops
The slaves look towards the house
Slowly, they begin to move towards it
- Louis, sitting in despair by the table
Yvette, the slave girl enters
Michi Louis
You don't want any supper
Louis laughs harshly
No, ma cher
need no supper
Is all well at Pointe Du Lac tonight
Yvette draws closer
Light reveals her beauty
We worry about you master
When do you ride about the fields
How long since you've been to the slave quarters
Everywhere there is death
Animals, men
Are you our master still at all
Louis watches her sadly
He's getting hungry
Her throat is long and slender, her breasts are gorgeous
(dazed) Leave me alone now, Yvette
will not go unless you listen to me
Send away this new friend of yours
The slaves are frightened of him
They are frightened of you
She comes closer, and he can hear her beating heart
She touches his hair
He takes her hand and brings it to his lips
am frightened of myself, Yvette
He kisses her wrist
She suddenly gasps, sharply, withdraws her hand
She sees her wrist is red with blood
She sees the blood on his lips
She screams
Louis stands
Hush, Yvette - She screams even louder
Louis clamps his hand over her mouth
Her hand grips the table-cloth, pulls, bringing the empty glasses and crockery to the floor
In horror, Louis realizes he has broken her neck
He brings her cut wrist to his lips, then drops it, revolted
He carries her body outside, grief-stricken
The drumming grows louder
- Fires burning in the distance, round the slave-cabins
The slaves are gathered at the foot of the mansion steps
They see Louis come out, holding the body of Yvette
He is deranged with grief
This place is cursed
Damned, do you hear me
And your master is the devil
He places the body of Yvette in a rocking chair on the veranda
Get out while you can
You're free men
They don't move
They stare at him blankly
Unlike me, you are no free men
He turns behind him, and looks at the mansion, all candelabra and chandeliers lighted, all windows open
Do  have to convince you
He rushed up the stairs, snatches up the candelabra and sets fire to the drapes
He goes from window to window, lighting drapes, lace curtains, everything
- Setting fire to the house
They rush up the stairs with shouts of " , ' "
wall of flame gushes out from the interior, blocking their way
- Louis, wandering from room to room of the burning mansion
he sees paintings of his wife consumed by the flames
He is weakening with the fumes, the heat
We can see this in his face, the texture of his skin
Suddenly a large french window cascades inwards and Lestat stands there, whip in hand
Behind him we can see the morning sky
You fool, what have you done
What you wouldn't do
It's almost sunrise
It will be the sun or the fire
You said they can kill me
The sun or the fire
Louis stands there, weakened, then collapses onto the floor
Lestat darts forward and catches him before he drops
He runs out the shattered window, carrying him on his shoulder
- With many crypts
Louis, unconscious, carried over Lestat's shoulder
Darkness
Louis lying on the floor of a large crypt
He slowly comes to
Where are we
Where do you think, my idiot friend
We're in a nice filthy cemetery
Does this make you happy
Is this fitting and proper enough
Louis laughs softly
We belong in hell
And what if there is no hell, or they don't want us there
Ever think of that
- The vampire sits in silence, as if tired by his story
Malloy speaks, hesitantly
You loved Yvette
Can a vampire feel love
You loved your wife, surely
was human then
Might as well ask can an angel feel love
Both are blesses or cursed with a certain
detachment
Though whether angels take as long to learn it as , will never know
He looks directly at Malloy, shocking him with his gaze
Yes,  loved Yvette
As  loved Pointe Du Lac
And as with each thing  loved,  destroyed it
- From the sea, at evening, shrouded in mist
(
) Lestat  did not love
And he survived
- lavish little supper chamber with coffered bed, fancy French furniture
Open to rooftops of colonial city
Louis sits by an open window looking out over the city
Behind, we can hear the laughter of Lestat and tow female voices
Louis turns and sees - Lestat, in the main chamber with two drugged or drunked whores
One runs her finger down his chest
The other seems out of it
#1 You're skin's icy
Not always
He presses his thumb on her neck and holds her tight, sinking his teeth into her neck
After a time she falls to the bed, dead
he turns to the other
Your friend has no head for wine
She's stupid
can warm that cold skin of yours better than she can
Do you think so
He rubs her breast
Why you're warm now
Ah, but the price is pretty high
Your sweet friend -  exhausted her
He bites her in turn, drinks her blood
She does into the swoon
Louis looks on in disgust
He stands
'm leaving you
can't stand this any longer
Lestat pulls away from the whore
What, no flowery speeches
About what a monster  am
What a vulgar fiend
'm not interested in you
You disgust me
'm interested in my own nature and know  can't trust you to tell me the truth about me
What do you imagine you are Louis
don't pretend to know
Don't you understand, Louis, that you alone of all creatures can see death with impunity
you alone under the rising moon can strike like the hand of God
The girl moans
Lestat, she's alive
Vampires are killers
Predators, who's all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment
The girl moans again, open her eyes
The girl, Lestat - know
Let her alone
He slashes her wrist with his teeth, and lets the blood drip into a glass
You think you can be human
You think you can go back
But you can't
You live off the blood of rats now Louis
How human is that
The girls moans again
Lestat drinks that glass
Lie still, love
The girl begins to scream
Lestat picks her up
You're tired love, you want to sleep
He walks to his coffin, puts her inside and sits on the lid
We hear muffled screaming and banging from inside
Why do you do this Lestat
like to do it
enjoy it
Take you aesthete's taste to purer things
Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it
For now doubt, you are a killer Louis
Ah
He stands up
The girl pushes the lid off, hysterical
She looks at Louis
It's a coffin, a coffin
Get me out
Of course it's a coffin
You're dead, love
Louis screams at Lestat Lestat - finish this - You finish her - if you feel so much - The girl grabs Louis and pleads
You won't let me die, will you
You'll save me
But it's too late, love
Look at your wrist, you breast
He picks her up again
He turns to Louis laughing
Unless  make her one of us
The girl screams
Louis puts his hands to his ears
Then Lestat, in a fit of pique puts his teeth to her neck
She dies at last
terrible silence descends
Lestat looks at Louis
My God
to think you
are all have to learn from
In the old world, they called it the dark gift, Louis
And  gave it to you
Louis leaves without a word
- rat scurried down a gutter, then another and another
Louis' hand grabs the rat
We see him from behind, walking down the street, gripping one, then another
(
) Am  damned
Am  from the devil
Is my very nature that of a devil
And all the while, as these dreaded questions caused me to neglect my thirst, my thirst grew hotter, my veins were threads of pain in my flesh, my temples throbbed
smaller side street, in which every house is marked with an
The street is crawling with rats, and Louis is following them
man passes with a lantern
Don't go that way Monsieur
It's the plague
Go back the way you came
Louis smiles bitterly at these words, repeating them to himself
The way  came
He walks on, following the rats
(
) and finally, when  could stand it no longer,  stood in an empty desolate street and heard the sound of a child crying
house, the door slightly open, marked with an
The sound of a child crying inside
Louis walks towards it
- little girl, pulling at a figure in a rocking chair
Mama, please wake up
Mama, 'm frightened, please wake up
As Louis enters, he sees the woman is dead
Her eyes are being eaten away by rats
Louis gasps in horror
Claudia turns
She is a radiant doll or angel as she stretches out her hand to Louis
Monsieur, please help us
Papa's waiting for us at the ship
Please wake mama, Monsieur
She runs to him
Instinctively, he gathers her in his arms
He looks down pitying on her beautiful face
(
) And if  am damned, why do  fell such pity for her gaunt face
Why do  wish to warm her tiny arms
Comfort her beating heart
She snuggles into him, suddenly utterly secure
She tugs at his hair, brings his head down towards her
And we see Louis shiver, as his lips go to her neck
Her breathing becomes calm as she goes into the swoon
Gradually another sound replaces it
' ,
Suddenly Louis backs away, caught red-handed, the child in his arms
He sees Lestat slapping his knee and laughing in the doorway
Ah, my philosopher, my martyr
"Never take a human life"
Well you must admit it is funny
Or is it merely touching
'm not sure
Louis stares at the unconscious Claudia in horror, then lets her slip gently into a chair
Shamefully he wipes his mouth, sees the tiny wounds on her throat
Lestat snatches up the dead mother from the chair and begins to dance with her in great circles, humming and talking
Her head falls back
Black water flows from her mouth
Let's make some party of it, shall we
Maybe there's some life in the old lady yet
Louis flees into the street
Come back, Louis, you are what you are
The plague would have got her within hours anyway
Merciful Death how you love your precious guilt
- Louis running through an assortment of streets
All the night life of New Orleans flows by him
(
) For years  had not savored a human
And when  had Lestat's words made sense to me
knew peace only when  killed and when heard her heart in that terrible rhythm  knew again what peace could be
Yet even then  could not contenance it
- Fingers of light in the sky
Louis, pale and shivering, walks splashing through the water
He comes to a huge sewer-pipe, crowded with rats
He crawls inside
- The same sewer-pipe
Now the bodies of dead rats lie all around
pair of fine leather boots splash through the water - Lestat's
- - Louis huddled there, so pale and shivering he seems close to death
Lestat comes through
All  need to find you Louis is follow the corpses of rats
He bends down to him, surprisingly gently and puts his own coat around him
Pain is terrible for you
You feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire
You don't want it to go on
No
They emerge from the sewer and walk along the waterfront
Do what it is in your nature to do
And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms
Oh God Lestat
felt peace
felt an end to the craving
That and more
He puts his arm around Louis, to stop his shivering
Evil is a point of view
God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we
For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves
Is God merciless
Greedy and cruel
Ah, but we have even more in common with our creator
come,  am like a mother tonight
want a child
Louis is baffled
He follows
- Lestat enters
She's here, your wounded one
What are you saying
You need company, Louis
More congenial than mine
Lestat holds up a candle and walks towards a large four- poster bed
Claudia lies there, angelic, under the coverlet, two marks on her neck
Lestat
You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her - didn't want to kill her
Don't worry, Louis, you're conscience is clear
You left her alive
Lestat shakes her gently
Claudia, Claudia, listen to me
You're ill, my precious and 'm going to give you what you need to get well
Lestat, what do you mean
Louis runs at him, but Lestat brushes him aside effortlessly, so he falls to the floor
Lestat bites his wrist and presses the bleeding wound to the child's mouth
He winces in pain
That's it dear
More
You must drink it to get well
Claudia sucks on the wound, reviving, making little noises like a person waking from sleep
Louis rises to his feet as Claudia clutches Lestat's arm, sucking the blood fiercely
Lestat moans
Stop, that's enough
No more
He pulls her loose and she growls and stares at him with big clear astonished eyes
want more
What have you done
Lestat puts her down on the bed and sits beside her, holding his wrist, obviously in pain
More
Yes, cherie, of course you want more
And 'll show you how to get it
You drink from morals, my beauty, but from me
Never again
Still suffering, Lestat pulls the bell-rope
Being transformed
Becoming white yet robust, bright- eyed yet crazed
She shakes her beautiful curls and the dust falls from them
They are shining in the candlelight
Louis cannot stop looking at her
He does not notices as - The  enters
Ah, quelle Belle enfant
The maid comes near the bed, kneels in front of Claudia
Lestat lays his hand on the maid's throat and Claudia watches keenly
Gently, cherie
They are so innocent
They must not be made to suffer
Claudia lunges for the throbbing vein in the neck, locking on to the flowing blood
The Maid is transfixed
Close on Louis, his anguish, his fascinated horror
You are the devil
You are the instrument of Satan
That's enough, cherie
Stop before the heart stops
He lets the dead maid onto the floor
Claudia looks at the corpse
want some more
It's bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it
yes, that's it
My child
My beloved child
Lestat and Claudia sit on the Louis  settee
Claudia is a vision, a doll made out of pearl
Animated, voice crisp
Where is Mamma
The words echo in Louis' head, as he puts his hands to his ears
Mamma's gone to Heaven, cherie, like that sweet lady over there
They all go to Heaven
And you did very well, cherie
Not a drop spilt
Very good
You're going to be our child now
Lestat takes out his comb and begins to comb her hair
Your mama's left you with us
She wants you to be happy
(whispers) You are the devil
You are the instrument of Satan
Shhhh
Do you want to frighten our little daughter
'm not your daughter
Yes you are, my dearest
You are mine and Louis' daughter
You see Louis was going to leave us
He was going to go away
But now he's not
He's going to stay and make you happy
Claudia runs over to him
She smiles at him
Lou
eee
Louis is conflicted
He cannot leave her
He touches her cheeks, her hair
Same as his
Vampire skin and hair
He draws in his breath, shocked by her beauty, then he embraces her as a father might a daughter
He looks over her shoulder to Lestat
You fiend
You monster
Lestat smiles One happy family
- Malloy is open mouthed
child vampire
He sees the tape has run out
He rapidly and clumsily sticks in another
Shall we go on
He did it to make you stay with him
Perhaps
He knew me
He knew would love her more than the waking world
But there was more to it than that
Perhaps in the end he did it - to show me that he could
For he lavished affection on her, there was no doubt about that
Life was very different with madame Claudia, as you can imagine
- ( ,  ) Two husky movers bring in furniture through the back courtyard, past the fountain and the banana trees, up the back stairs and into - Striped wallpaper gives way to flowers in the bedrooms
Huge four-poster beds in the bedrooms, and large chests, as big as coffins standing against the wall
Everywhere there are candles and pretty Louis furniture
Lestat gives instructions to the movers
We see Claudia draped in lace standing on a petit point chair as a  measure out a garment
Louis can be seen, in an inner room
Monsieur,  need more light shall go slind if you do not bring me a lamp, or let me fit this child during the day
Ouch
She has pricked her hand
spot of blood appears on her finger Claudia takes her hand
Let me kiss it better
Claudia brings the hand to her lips
The dressmaker abruptly pulls her finger away, in pain again
- her finger, two holes showing
(
) little child she was, but also a fierce killer, now capable of the ruthless pursuit of blood with all a child's demanding
Lestat walks through - sees the dressmaker lying dead at Claudia's feet, Claudia still on the chair in the half-finished dress
Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn
Who will we get now to finish your dress
little practicality, cherie
'  - (
) She would sleep in my coffin, daily, curl her child's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of know not what
Claudia and Louis, sleeping in a coffin together, Claudia's fingers curling his hair
' Claudia playing with dolls, each as perfect and beautifully dressed as she is
(
) Mute and beautiful, she played with dolls, dressing them and undressing them by the hour
- Claudia tinkling with her child's hands on the piano, picking out a hesitant tune
(
) Mute and beautiful, she killed
And to watch her kill was chilling
- The tinkling of Claudia's piano is heard, over - well-dressed lady, walking through a square lit by gaslight
The lady hears a child's sobbing and stops, turns
Claudia, the picture of lost innocence, sitting on a bench and crying
Why are you crying, child
The woman, all solicitude, goes to Claudia
Are you lost, my love
Mama
Hush now, don't cry, We'll find her
Mama
The woman takes Claudia in her arms
Claudia nestles her head in her shoulder, her teeth near her neck
(
) They found death fast in those days, before she learnt to play with the, to delay the moment till she had taken what she wanted
- stern, stiff - (male) beating time with a ruler as Claudia picks out scales on the piano
He raps her on the knuckles
- The thumb girl
Mind the thumb
Claudia glares at him, then returns to playing, improving rapidly
- - Piano music over
Mozart, now well played
Claudia staring at a glass case, inside of which are an array of eighteenth century dolls
An old looks down on her
They are expensive, my dear
Maybe too expensive for a young girl like you
- Claudia walking along, clutching the doll
- - The dollmaker lying dead, two puncture marks in his throat, his dolls scattered all around him
' - Claudia and Louis looking through the window at a display of coffins
Claudia point at the smallest one
(
) She grew, yet stayed the same
She wanted a bed of her own, yet would climb back into mine
'  - The child's coffin on the floor
The lid lifts
Claudia emerges, yawning, wanders through the flat into - ' Where his coffin sits
She slides the lid off, and curls in beside him
- Claudia playing the piano, now with remarkable dexterity
The piano-teacher sits mute beside her
As she plays, he topples over and falls to the ground
We see the puncture-marks in his neck
Lestat, hearing the noise, comes in
Claudia, Claudia
Didn't  tell you, never in the house
Claudia smiles to herself, keeps playing
'  - sing in a cage, above a child's coffin
Claudia is writing at a secretaire
She is writing in a diary with a quill pen in an adult hand
She murmurs the date as she writes
September 21st, one hour after sunset
The sky is still violet, the way Louis loves and as always Lestat was gone when we rose
She looks up and sees Louis in the doorway, watching her
How did you learn to write, Claudia
The way  learn everything
By watching you
She closes the diary
But you never let me see you kill, Louis
Lestat taught you all you need to know about that
Infant death, he calls me
Sweet daughter death
You know what he calls you
Merciful death
He jests
Why does he call you that
Hush, Claudia don't talk about such things
Show me your book
She opens it
Inside there is a beautiful pen and ink portrait of Louis
Claudia
You did that
Sit still
It's not finished - She begins to fill in the sketch
(
) Time can pass fast for mortals when they're happy
With us it was the same
-  (1800') Street lamps are oil at this period
Houses are now tall two-story Spanish style
Streets are flagstone
Passing carriages are black
(
) It was a very different life
And a new century was beginning
what had once been a small godforsaken French colony was growing into a great port, giving us an endless train of magnificent strangers
Claudia, Louis and Lestat, dressed in the same clothes walking through a raucous carnival with sideshows
Crowd milling around, sailors, whores, children, thieves, freed slaves, Indians
They pass a Wild West display, jugglers, fire-eaters, three-card tricksters
(
) All human life was here, for the taking
And we took, all three of us, in our different ways
They come to a raised platform where a troupe of perfectly-formed midgets do a burlesque show
Claudia stops
She stares, at these small, perfect creatures like herself, intrigued and troubled
Louis and Lestat walk on, not noticing as - Circles the troupe
She comes to a small tent, behind it
At the entrance stands a midget youth
You want to come inside, lovely
Claudia walks up to him
Ever been kissed
Claudia shakes her head
He kisses her
Claudia allow her to be kissed, then bites his tongue
he youth struggles, as Claudia holds him and drains him
She lets him go as Louis appears behind her
She's like me, Louis
Small and yet not small at all
Like me
Louis hurriedly draws her away
(
) watched her grow yet stay the same, her doll-like face possessed of adult eyes, eerie, powerful, seductive
- Claudia playing the piano, now like a demonic Liszt
Louis writing
Lestat appears in the doorway
He has a big box in his arms
Another doll
have ten, you realize
early 19th Century French dolls - wood, glass, wax, bisque - all around the bedroom, on chairs, on the bed
Some newish, some tattered old
Well,  thought you could use another
He hands her the box
It is a fine Parisian Jumeau doll
She likes it and stokes its face
Why always on this night
What night
What do you mean
You always give me the doll on the same night of the year
didn't realize
Is this my birthday
He examines the other dolls
Some of these are so old and tattered
You should throw them away
have
Or there would be twice as many
But you're the fairest by far
You dress me like a doll
You make my hair like a doll
Why
Lestat doesn't answer
Claudia stands up quickly, and strides out into the - Where Louis is reading by the window
She walks to a mirrored cabinet, takes out a scissors and begins cutting her hair
You want me to be a doll forever
Claudia - don't - Why not
She continues cutting
She sees Lestat emerge from her bedroom in the mirror behind her then turns to him, an angelic little boy's face now with soft curls around her face
Can't  change, like everybody else
She walks past him, back into her bedroom and slams the door
beat
Louis looks from the mass of blonde hair on the floor to Lestat
Then a   pierces the silence
More screams, which become roars
' She stands before the dressing-table, all her long hair grown back over her shoulders
She holds it with both hands, screaming and screaming
Lestat and Louis come through the door
Which of you did it
Which of you made me the way  am
What you are
You would be something other than you are
And if  cut my hair again
It will grow back again
But it wasn't always so
had a mother once
And Louis - he had a wife
He was mortal the same as she
And so was
Claudia - She turns on Lestat
You made us what we are, didn't you
Stop her Louis
She runs at him with the scissors, scoring his face
The cut heals
She scores it again
It heals again
She stares at him in horror
(whispering) How did you do it
And why should  tell you
It's in my power
Why yours alone
Tell me how it was done
Be glad  made you what you are
You'd be dead not if  hadn't
He storms out
Louis goes to Claudia and picks her up in his arms
(tenderly) We're immortal
You've always known that
Tell me why
you've got to tell me
Louis carries her outside, onto the porch
There is an old flower-seller going by
You see the old woman
That will never happen to you
You'll never grow old
You will never die
And it means something else too, doesn't it
shall never, ever grow up
She clutches Louis desperately
hate him
But  cannot bear to lose you
You're the only companion have, forever
You taught me everything  know
Please tell me Louis
Tell me how it came to be that  am this
thing
Louis strokes her beautiful face, her hair
Come
've something to show you
- Louis walking, holding Claudia as if he was about to lose her
(
) Though everything was changed, through the years had warped the contours of the streets,  found my way there, aware that 'd always known where it was and avoided it, not wanting to pass the doorway where 'd first heard Claudia cry
Louis back in the same street, outside the same house
He stands with Claudia at the window
There is a family inside, a picture of domestic tranquility
heard you crying
You were there in a room with your mother
You were hugging her for warmth, crying pitifully as you had been for days
Because your mother was dead
Claudia stares at him, suddenly very cold, very alert
opened the shutters
came into the room
felt pity for you
Pity, but something else
He can't go on
Claudia's eyes are remorseless
You
fed on me
And he found me with you
ran, sickened at what 'd done
Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him
tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then
And have been every night hereafter
You both did it
took your life
He gave you another one
Claudia speaks through indrawn breath
And here it is
And  hate you both
She runs
Malloy and Louis
But why did you tell her
How could  not
She had to know
And did you lose her
Did she go
Where would she have gone
She was a child, and beautiful, heartbreaking merciless child
And had made her that
- Louis, walking the streets, shivering
walked all night
walked as walked years before when my mind swam with guilt at the thought of killing
found myself at the Cathedral
cathedral rising out of the mist, the doors open
thought of all the things  had done and couldn't undo
And longed for one second's peace
Louis walks towards the doors, inside
- Louis enters
The dim lights of candles
sacristan tending the altar, an old woman praying - otherwise empty
had no fear
If anything  longed for something to happen, for the stones to tremble as  entered the foyer
Louis walking down the nave of the church
He stops by the alter
almost genuflected from old habit
almost prayed
Louis sits in a pew
And then it struck me
' The cross, the statues, the tabernacle
What if the statues gave an image to nothing
What if  was the supernatural in this cathedral
The only immortal under this roof
And felt nothing but loneliness
Loneliness to the point of madness
Suddenly a hand is laid on his shoulder
Louis almost jumps
He turns and sees the face of a grey-haired priest
You wish to go to confession
was about to lock up the church
Louis stares at him, tears in his eyes
You are troubled, aren't you
Can help
It's too late, too late - No, it's never too late
Come
The priest gestures to the confessional
Louis rises, slowly
Louis, kneeling in the darkness
The hatch slides back
Bless me father for  have sinned so often and so long,  don't know how to change nor beg for forgiveness
Son, God is infinite in his capacity to forgive
Tell him from your heart
Murders, father, death after death
The woman who died two nights ago in Jackson Square,  killed her
And thousands of others before her
have walked the streets of New Orleans like the Grim reaper
And fed on human life for my own
am a vampire, father, and have turned the one  love most of all into on too - The hatch slams down
Louis rises, confused, and the door is flung open, the priest stands there
Do you know the meaning of sacrilege
Louis rises
Walks out
Then there is no mercy
His face comes into the light
The priest steps back, open-mouthed
You talk of sacrilege
Why if God exists does he suffer me to exist
He bares his fangs
The priest runs, screaming
Gets to the bellrope, begins to ring the bell
Louis swoops on him
Why does he suffer me to live
Louis takes him, lifting him from the floor, till his feet stop kicking
- Louis enters, silently, like a corpse
He hears a voice behind him
Locked together in hatred - He turns, sees her sitting in the darkness
She is wearing a tiny nightgown of stitched lace and pearls, weirdly adult and seductive
She comes towards him
But  can't hate you Louis
She sprays perfume over her body as she comes nearer
Is this the aroma of a mortal child
She whispers
Louis
Lover
She kisses his cheek
was mortal to you
You gave me your immortal kiss
You became my mother and my father
And so 'm yours
Forever
She takes his face in her hands
But now's the time to end it, Louis
Now's the time to leave him
He'll never let us go
Claudia smiles
Oh
really
-   - sailing ship, by the docks
Louis and Claudia talking to a shipping-clerk
(
) So we made plans
She was convinced there were others of our kind in Europe, that they would have the answers Lestat couldn't provide
Lestat whom she now hated, who she thought she could be free of doubted, but then she had a surprise in store
- Lestat playing the piano
Louis reading
Claudia enters, wearing a cape and hat
She walks to the piano, sits at the end of the piano and stares at him as he plays
What is it now
You irritate me
Your very presence irritates me
(sweetly) Does it
Yes
And 'll tell you something else
've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you
Is that supposed to frighten me
You're spoilt because you're an only child
You need a brother
Or do
'm weary of you both
suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us
Not you my dear
You're a liar
But you upset my plans
What plans
came to make peace with you, even if you're the father of lies want things to be as they were
Louis perks up, puzzled
Stop pestering me then
Oh, Lestat
must do more than that
've brought a present for you
Then  hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess
Claudia stares at him for a moment
Better than that
She takes his hand and leads him into an inner room
Louis follows behind
You haven't fed enough
can tell by your color
- Two beautiful youths, lying asleep on a couch, by a table full with a half-eaten meal
Lestat sighs
Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself
Where did you find them
Drunk on brandy wine
thimbleful
thought of you when  saw them
We forgive each other then
Claudia stares at him, sitting
She nods
Lestat bites into the neck of one of the youths, sucks greedily and horribly
Claudia watches him without expression
He finished one, is about to take the other when he staggers
He looks at Claudia
Absinthe
You gave them absinthe
No
Laudanum
Lestat stares wildly at her, tries to move towards her, then slips to the floor
Laudanum
Yes
It killed them, unfortunately
But it keeps the blood warm
Lestat tries to rise
Ah Louis, Louis, she killed them
and let me drink
Louis watches, appalled
He goes to move
Don't Louis - Louis, put me in my coffin
'll put you in your coffin
Forever
She pulls a knife out from under her shawl, walks rapidly to him and slashes his throat
Blood explodes from it
Claudia
Don't do this thing
Louis, Louis,  gave you the gift - help me - Claudia lacerates his face
Blood pours from everywhere
She plunges the knife in his chest
He falls back, fangs bared, clutching the knife
Claudia leaps on him then, bites deep into his neck as he dies
Louis screams, runs forward, pulls her away
What have you done, Claudia - He drags her off Lestat, tries to pull her out of the room
She hisses at him
Louis
Look what's happening to him
Louis looks
The floor is a sea of blood
Lestat has begun to shrivel, as if he'd been a bag of blood
His skin is shriveling against his bones like parchment, his eyes are slipping back into his skull-like face
His lush, beautiful hair remains unchanged
But his clothes are virtually being emptied of the body
It is no more than bones, wrapped in paper and the pupils of the eyes suddenly roll up into the papered skull
Lestat
Oh, God forgive us
Don't mock me, Louis
Help me
She stares at the shriveled skeleton in its skin wrapping
She is fascinated
She sees the vampiric blood flow all over the floor
She touches it and brings her finger to her lips
Goodnight, sweet prince, may flights of devils wing you to your rest
Louis walks forward, touches the skeleton, the blonde hair
He's dead, Claudia, dead
The one good lesson he taught me, Louis
Never drink from the dead
She stands up, all business suddenly
Help me
We must get rid of him
She drags the coverlet from the table, knocking the crockery over the dead youths, and wraps Lestat's skeleton in it
She takes a bunch of chrysanthemums and places them in his skeleton hands
Should we burn him
Bury him
What would he have liked, Louis
Don't mock, Claudia
The swamp
- Louis whipping the horses
Claudia beside him
Lestat's skeleton in the back, with the bodies of the two dead youths
In Europe, Louis
We shall meet our own kind
Find the one who made him
Learn what it means
And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing
And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge
The carriage pulls up by a swamp
Mist everywhere
Overhanging creepers
And if we find the one who made him
Do we tell him we destroyed his own creation
The vampire Lestat
Louis drags out the bodies of the boys
He slides them into the waters of the swamp
We see ripples in the water and the churning of alligators, as they attack the corpses
Louis takes Lestat's skeleton in his arms
He slides it into the waters
The alligators speed towards it
He belongs with those reptiles, Louis
He deserved to die
Then maybe so do we
Every night of our lives
He was my brother
My maker
He gave me this life, whatever it is
did it for us, Louis
So we could be free
He stands there, saying nothing
Louis, look at me
(bitterly) can't
Go away from me
Claudia is shocked to her core
She steps back
Louis stares at the rippling waters
Gradually the movement of alligators stops
Then he hears a sound he hasn't heard in years
Soft, choking
He turns, sees Claudia sitting by a cypress tree, like a little girl for the first time in years
She is weeping copiously
Claudia - You're crying - We see her face, tears of blood running down it
She is heartbroken, lost
You never talked to me like that - in all these years
And you never cried - can't bear it when you do - would die rather than lose you Louis
would die the way he died
Louis gathers her in his arms
Hush, Claudia, hush now my dear - Tell me you don't hate me Louis did it for you - Louis walks her towards the carriage
love you Claudia
Always
And we are free now, Claudia
No Lestat
Just the two of us, beginning the great adventure of our lives
He lifts her into the carriage and drives off, leaving the silent waters of the swamp
- Sturdy mulatto workmen lifting cases and trunks out of the apartment
All the furniture is covered in white sheets
Claudia dressed in a cap and hat, is playing the piano by the light of one remaining oil-lamp
Louis comes from her room with the cage of canaries
The birds
We forgot about the birds
There's nothing for it but to let them go
He opens the cage, and the canaries fly around the room
There is a knocking on the door
Claudia falters
What was that
The workmen must have a trunk - don't stop, cherie - He goes downstairs
Claudia plays a moment, then stops, perturbed
She goes to the window
Then sees something out there that makes her face go white
She screams
Louis
Louis walking to the door
The knocking gets louder
Claudia runs for the stairs, after Louis
Louis reaches the door
The knocking gets louder
He opens the door as - Reaches the stairs
She screams - Don't Louis - But Louis has opened the door
Nothing there
He looks back at Claudia, puzzled, then at the door again when, swooping into his vision comes the nightmare image of - In filthy swamp-soaked rags, robust again, but his flesh shriveled, covered in scars, his eyes riddled, bloodshot
he roars
Louis throws his body against the door, slamming it on Lestat's reaching hand
The hand withdraws, as Lestat roars
Louis bolts the door
Louis runs up the stairs, sweeps Claudia in his arms, watching appalled as the door shudders with the force of Lestat's body
Louis runs through with Claudia in his arms
It can't be - It is
Take the back stairwell - Suddenly Lestat crashes through the casement window, scattering blood everywhere, reefing himself on the shattered glass
He tumbles to the floor and gets unsteadily to his feet
Louis throws Claudia behind him and hurls himself on Lestat, who fights like a ravening animal, bits of his broken body coming off in the process
Then with a terrifying effort, Lestat hurls Louis off, goes for Claudia, who grabs the poker from the fireplace, scatters burning coals over him
He falls back, then comes at her again, as the drapes catch fire
Louis grabs the lamp
Stay back - for the love of God
or 'll burn you alive
Lestat lunges again at Claudia
Louis hurls the lamp, which explodes him in flame
Lestat screams in agony, whirls around the room, then comes on Claudia again
She hurls another lamp
Louis throws the flaming sheets around him, wrapping him further in fire
Lestat falls to his knees, choking, hands up over his face in the smoke
The whole parlor is afire
Louis gathers up Claudia, smothering the burning house, carries her down the back stairs, through the carriage way and through the gathering crowds of mortals into the street
- Louis running, with Claudia in his arms
He looks back at the flames of the house
Sound of a ship's horn
The ship is sailing without us
Not yet
Holding her tightly, Louis runs
- Louis stands at the railings in the morning mist as the ship moves down the river
He sees
With flame lighting up the sky
(
) Though the fire seemed to spread through the quartier,  stood on that deck until dawn, fearful he would come out again of the very river like some monster to destroy us both
And all the while thought, Lestat, we deserve your vengeance
You gave me the dark gift
And  delivered you into the hands of death for the second time
Louis and Malloy
Did he die in the fire
He was dead to us
We were free
That was all that mattered
- The ship, shrouded in mist
(
) Though the ship was blessedly free of rats, a strange plague nonetheless struck its passengers
body is slipped into the sea
priest reads last rites to a mourning family
Trunks and cases, creaking with the ship's movement
Dead rats everywhere
(
) Claudia and  alone seemed immune
We kept to ourselves, pondering the mystery of Lestat and the greater mystery of each other
- Passing through the Straits of Gibralter
(
) We reached the Mediterranean wanted those waters to be blue
They were black, nighttime waters and how  suffered then, straining to remember the color that a young man's senses had taken for granted, that my memory had let slip away for eternity
It was black off the coast of Italy, black off the coast of Greece, Europe itself was black
- Claudia, sitting with an easel and sketch-pad, sketching the bay of Naples
beautifully realized drawing, all in shades of grey and black
Louis observes
Louis, your quest is for darkness only
This sea is not your sea
They myths of men are not your myths
Their history isn't yours
The sketch changes to a sketch of - In the moonlight
(
) We saw the Acropolis by moonlight, shades of grey and silver
And longed for the brilliant white of those marbles in the hot sun of Homer
The sketch changes to a sketch of - And the traditional shapes of the vampire landscape
(
) We docked at Varna and searched the rural countryside of the Carpathians, for what she liked to term "our kind"
,
,
The quest for these Old World vampires filled me with bitterness
We searched village after village, ruin after ruin and  was glad when always we found nothing
For what could the damned really have to say to the damned
Malloy and Louis
You found nothing
Peasant rumors, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again
Bull shit
But one of our kind
Not a whisper
No vampires in Transylvania
No Count Dracula
Fictions, my friend
The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman
So we repaired to Paris
Crowds and gaslight everywhere
Carriages, horses, coming from the opera house
(
) think the very name of Paris brought a rush of pleasure to me that was extraordinary
was a Creole, after all and Paris was the mother of New Orleans, a universe whole and entire unto herself
18TH      - The high walls of the Louvre, dark figures walking in pairs through the shadowy tulieries
- Claudia, in furtrimmed muff and bonnet, peers through the glass at a display of dolls
Each doll in there seems to resemble her, with blonde hair and blue eyes
She peers deep into the shop and sees - , a young woman bent over a workbench painting a doll's face, oblivious to being watched
Louis and Claudia hurrying hand in hand with a crowd of mortals towards the sound of an beyond
Claudia and Louis standing in the deep shadows, looking at the branching arches
Louis is overcome with sadness, Claudia is fascinated
Louis and Claudia walk among a series of mythological nudes by Poussin
- Claudia, surrounded by discarded dresses and outfits, being attended by couturiers
All the clothes are tiny, to fit her frame, but have an adult cut and shape
We were alive again
We were in love and so euphoric was  that yielded to her every desire
Full of late 19th century furniture, lots of Empire style, Regency, gilt, velvet and brocade
Against a wall, solemn among all the light and glitter
By a large gilt mirror, in her new clothes
She is covered with jewelry, fixing earrings to her ears
Help me, mon chere
Louis walks over, helps her with the earrings
How do  look
Still my beautiful child
Claudia laughs
beautiful child
Is that what you still think  am
Yes
He turns away
Why do you turn away
Why don't you look
She twirls, looking at herself in the mirror, then stops, stares at herself
You want me to be your daughter forever, don't you
Yes
Well tell me, papa
What was it like making love
Louis is stunned
He blushes
You don't remember
Or you never knew
It was something hurries
and seldom savored
something acute that was quickly lost
It was the pale shadow of killing
But how will  ever know, Louis
She stares at him through the mirror
'll never find them, will
My own kind
- Louis and Claudia walk along a boulevard like father and daughter
All around them are bourgeois Parisian families on their evening stroll
Claudia points at the children that pass
Have  anything in common with her, Louis
She points to a beautiful French child walking by with her mother
Or her, or her - or any of them
Claudia, you torture yourself
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans
Whereas  must be the duckling forever
You are more beautiful than any of them
- - We see Madeleine, inside, painting a doll's face
Louis and Claudia arrive outside
All her dolls resemble me
Claudia's face, with the dolls in the background
The resemblance is uncanny
Are they my kind Louis
Dolls never change either
You are neither, Claudia
Now stop this - Madeleine sees Claudia from inside
She waves
You know her
Yes
Should  take her, Louis
Among her dolls
make a doll of her in turn
Come, Claudia
He takes her arm
But Claudia shakes him off, and moves into the shop
- Louis walks briskly, head bowed
(
) For a time we had been almost human, in the sensual whirl of what Paris had to offer
But the human delights of that city only served to remind her of the ageless child she had become
felt her pain as walked until  become aware that was being followed
- ' Walking
step echoes his
Louis stops
Turns, sees nothing
Then walks again
The echoing steps begin again
Louis again
Sees a shadow, flitting
Claudia
Nothing
He walks again, hears the same effect
Then he stops
He stares at a gaslamp opposite
(
) So it was when  had given up the search for vampires that a vampire found me
Santiago, a tall vampire, materializes under the gaslight
And Louis gradually realizes that this vampire has assumed the same attitude, posture, clothes and hair-style as Louis
Louis gives an involuntary shake of the head
Santiago mimics
Louis takes a step forwards
Santiago mimics
Louis folds his arms
Santiago mimics
& (simultaneously) Clever
You mean me harm
(a beat later) You mean me harm
Louis calculates
Trickster
Buffoon
Santiago echoes the first word, but not the second
Louis has broken his composure
He turns his back on Santiago, only to come face to face with Santiago right in front of him
Again Louis turns this back to find Santiago facing him
Louis turns, glowers, refusing to look at him
've searched the world for an immortal and this is what  find
Slowly he looks up
Santiago draws close, breaking the mirror trick and suddenly slams Louis back against the wall
Louis is furious
He regains his balance, strikes out at Santiago and when Santiago vanishes, to reappear behind him, Louis slams back his elbow into his midriff
Santiago staggers, amazed and then rushes at Louis, throwing him down
Louis rolls back to his feet, then to his amazement sees two vampires, on in front, on behind
He looks both ways, then sees one has vanished
He stares, awestruck, at this new one: He looks like an angel
You are all right
He reaches into his waistcoat, takes an engraved invitation out of his pocket and thrusts it at Louis
Louis reads it aloud, as we see: " By Special Invitation Friday, 9 p
m
" Bring the petit beauty with you
No one will harm you
won't allow it
Remember my name
Armand
Armand bows and vanishes
Louis listens to the silence
-    - Louis formally dressed with Claudia in rich attire on his arm
They pass people buying tickets for the theatre and go inside
Remember what 've told you
They'll have different powers
They'll read your thoughts if you allow it
They draw close to: Reading - " By Edgar Allen Poe" The posters are illustrated with cliched images of vampires overcoming damsels in distress
But this can't be real
This is nonsense
Nonsense all right
But something tell me it's going to be the strangest nonsense we've ever seen
Warily, they show their invitations to the mortal ticket taker at the door
He glances away indifferently
- Claudia and Louis look at the crowd as the lights go down
Mortals, mortals everywhere
And lots of drops to drink
They are here
know they are
Listen for something that doesn't make a sound
Stage: curtain rises
An elaborate painted set of an Italianate castle
Death standing before it, the traditional image of the Grim Reaper, complete with magnificent scythe
(whispers) It's a vampire
It's the one  saw in Rue St Jacques
version of the Poe story unfolds before them
All of the participants are vampires
All beautiful gleaming white, aged 20 or 30
They use no paint
And the audience think it is paint
How devilishly clever
spotlight uncovers a mortal woman suddenly forced out upon the stage
She's no vampire
No
She's frightened
She doesn't know where she is
The audience laughs uneasily, then stops as the Mortal Woman comes into the footlights
She is too beautiful, too confused
Santiago, as Death, advances on her
She backs away, terrified, then sees the other vampires, in a phalanx, advancing from behind, in a half-circle
don't want to die
She looks around in panic
Santiago swoons, arms over his breast as if he is hopelessly in love
We are death
The Mortal Woman steps to the footlights
Someone help me
Please
What have  done
Louis whispers to Claudia
This is no performance
And no one knows but us
We all die
Death is the one thing you share with all those here
Santiago gestures to the audience
Rapt faces
But 'm young
Death is no respecter of age
He can come any time, any place
Need tell you what fate has in store for you
would take my chance
Let me go
Please
And if you take that chance and live, what is your fate
The humpbacked toothless visage of old age
Santiago approaches her and tears the drawstring out of her peasant blouse
It opens completely and starts to slip
She tries to catch it, but gently stops her wrists
The blouse falls, exposing her young breasts
This is monstrous
Yes, and very beautiful
Just as this flesh is pink now, it will turn grey and wrinkle with age
Let me live, please
don't care
Then why should you care if you die now
She shakes her head, confused
he catches her wrists behind her back
Is awestruck by her beauty, her suffering
Draws near her cheek
And suppose death had a heart to love and to release you
To whom would he turn his passion
Would you pick a person from the crowd there
person to suffer as you suffer
young girl cries out in jest
Oh, yes, take me Monsieur Vampire
adore you
Audience roars with laughter
You wait your turn
The audience laughs again
The Mortal Woman shakes her head in panic
Well, have you a sister, a mother, a daughter you would send in your place
Even she is repelled by the cruelty
She shakes her head
Shakes her head
She is helpless
We alone can give death meaning
Do you know what it means to be loved by death, to become our bride
Mortal Woman looks up on the verge of hysteria or fainting
But then her eyes mist over
She is being entranced
We realize she is looking past Santiago at the divinely beautiful Armand, who has just stepped out of the wings
Armand has entranced her
He passes Santiago
Santiago stiffens, but yields the stage
No pain
No pain
Armand takes her by the naked shoulders
Your beauty is a gift to us
Armand gestures to the others who slowly, gracefully close in
Who deserves such a gift
He pulls the drawstring from her skirt and it falls revealing her nakedness
But she is spellbound
No pain
Armand embraces her, drinks, her naked body stark against her black clothes, then he passes her to the other vampires one by one
Who battles desire and hunger with anger
've seen enough of this
loathe it
Be still
The naked Mortal Woman lies dead on the floor
The vampires seem to vanish one by one
As the curtain draws across, the Audience loudly applauds what they presume are theatrical tricks
The audience, milling towards the exits
They talk in vacuous terms about the beauty of the show, the symbolism of it, the daring of it as they leave
Gradually Louis and Claudia are left alone in the empty theatre
Louis seems anxious to leave
Claudia whispers in his ear
Patience, Louis
Patience
He looks around the empty theatre, more eerie now than when the play was on
The red curtain shifts slightly in a hidden breeze, a candle sputters and dies in a box
Then the candle flares again, and we see Armand in the box, looking down on them
He stares with a dreamy expression, saying nothing
We've been searching for you for a very long time
His voice echoes eerily
Armand gestures for them to follow him
Armand leading, Louis and Claudia following
It opens into a - Walls are painted with famous copies of Durer, Brueghel, Goya and Bosch depictions of death
Fine wooden coffins line the walls
Candles burn in sconces, casting alternate shadows and pools of light
Armand walks through, gesturing Louis and Claudia to follow him
As they walk through, vampire man and women appear out of the shadows like wraiths, startling them, drifting around them, stroking them, touching Claudia as if she were a doll
Shrieks of preternatural laughter
Armand gestures to the vampires to back off
All obey but
Such a darling
She menaces Claudia, her breasts enormous, her fangs bared
Armand throw her a look, and she is flung against the wall
Louis stares around
The vampires faces drift towards him and away, always disclosing the face of Armand, who seems some distance away, but strangely close, staring at Louis with a constantly calm, hypnotic gaze
Then a young mortal boy comes from the shadows with a candelabra, which he hands to Armand
Armand and the boy come towards them, leading them along the walls, his candelabra illuminating the ghastly murals, his face gleaming like an angel above the candleflame
Monstrous
Yes, and very beautiful
Your lips, they didn't move
They did, but too fast for you to see them
No magic, just grace and speed
The boy is watching Louis
Armand's hand beckons and the boy draws up to Louis in the candlelight
He places his arms on Louis' shoulders
Louis glances at Armand, who smiles
Louis sees the puncture marks on the boy's neck
He wants you
Louis is utterly confused
Can't resist
Drinks his blood
The boy's body presses against him, sensual, willing
The other vampires appear all around Louis, who suddenly senses it and draws away, ashamed
Claudia watches warily, from a distance
Armand beckons at her and Louis and open a door in the wall which reveals a stone staircase
Medieval chairs, table, an old coffin, a bed in one corner, a blazing fire
medieval painting of Satan, being banished from heaven, above the fire
Armand places the boy on the bed, settling him so he sleeps
Disappointing, isn't it
To come so far and find so little
Jaded ingenues, amusing themselves with make- believe
We had feared we were the only ones
But how did you come into existence
He glances at Louis, then at Claudia, who averts her eyes
You don't want to answer
Two vampires from the new world, come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away
Are you the leader of this group
If there were a leader,  would be the one
Claudia stares at him constantly, guarded
So you have the answers
Ah
You have questions
What are we
Nothing if not vampires
Who made us what we are
Surely you know the one who made you
But the one who made him, who made the one who made him, the source of all this evil
Louis looks at the picture
Armand watches him
That is a picture, nothing more
You mean we are not children of Satan
No
He smiles at Louis
smile of infinite compassion
understand
saw you in the theatre, your suffering, your sympathy for that girl
saw you with the boy
You die when you kill, you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing
But does that make you evil
Or, since you comprehend what you call goodness, does it not make you good
Then there is nothing
Perhaps
He passes his finger through the candle flame
And perhaps this is the only real evil left
Then God does not exist
have not spoken to him
And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil
None that 've ever known
know nothing of God or the Devil,  have never seen a vision nor learnt a secret that would damn or save my soul
And as far as  know, after four hundred years  am the oldest living vampire in the world
He stares at them, his face angelic, hypnotic, young
His eyes hold them both in a trance
My God
So it's as  always feared
Nothing, leading to nothing
You fell too much
So much you make me feel
He stares from Claudia to Louis
He seems to be reading their souls
The one who made you should have told you this
The one who left the old world for the new
He knew nothing
He just didn't care
Knew
You mean he is
Claudia appears suddenly to Louis' shoulder, interrupting
Come, beloved
It's time we were on our way
'm hungry and the city waits
She stares hard at Armand
Armand looks from her to Louis
So soon to go
He seems genuinely regretful
But Claudia pulls Louis out
- Louis and Claudia feel their way through darkened corridors, trying to find their way out
(
) The place was dark as we left, a darkness that confounded even Claudia
And as we blundered through it, again came the thought: have wronged Lestat,  have hated him for the wrong reasons
Suddenly a light comes on
They see they are in the empty theatre
Santiago stands on the stage, under a candle
How did you wrong him
Louis is stunned
You read my thoughts
You said a name - name  don't want to say again
seemed to recognize it
Other vampires appear behind him
There is but one crime among us vampires here
He looks at Claudia
You should know, who are so secretive about the vampire who made you
Claudia laughs
Boredom
It is the crime that means death to any vampire
To kill your own kind
Aaaah
was so afraid it was to be born like Venus out of the foam, as we were
Come Louis, let's go
- Claudia and Louis enter the Lobby
loathe them
can't stand the sight of them
Stupid bourgeois Parisians, all dressed in black like some private club
've searched for them the world over and  despise them
What danger
can feel it from them
They want to know who made us, what became of him
They have their rules, their idiotic rules
They come to their room, enter
- Louis closes the door behind him
Claudia paces
Do you think  would let them harm you
No, you would not, Louis
Danger hold you to me
Love holds you to me
And we are in danger, not you
Love
She smiles at him
strange, sad, adult smile
You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you
Never
He wants you as you want him
He's been waiting for you
He wants you for a companion
He bides his time that place
he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do
That's not so
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word
When he put me in that trance
So you felt it too
Let him go, he said
Let him go
She touches his face
Is that what  should do Louis
Let you go
My father
My lover
My Louis, who made me
There are tears in her eyes
Louis lifts her up in his arms
He can protect us, Claudia
You really believe that
- - Claudia, staring at the dolls
We see Madeleine inside, painting a doll
She sees Claudia and smiles and waves
- Louis, sitting alone in the box, as the curtains draw back, to show Santiago as death, as before
Louis takes advantage of the darkness to slip away
'  - Armand opens the door to Louis' knock
was waiting for you
Listen to me
He follows Armand into the room
Claudia is dear to me
My
daughter
Your lover
No, my beloved, my child
If you say so
You are innocent
'm not innocent
But 'm afraid
She feels she's in danger from the others
She is
But why
could give you reasons
Her silence
Her youth
It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own
Then blame the one who made her
Did you kill this vampire who made you both
Is that why you won't say his name
Santiago thinks you did
We want no quarrel with him
It's already begun
If you want to save her, send her away
Then  leave too
Armand smiles
So soon
Without any of those answers you so longed for
You said there were none
But you asked the wrong questions
Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality
How quickly they perish of their own will
We can do that
You would never give up life
If the world were reduced to one empty cell, on fragile candle, you stay alive and study it
You see too clearly
You see too much
That's what the one who made me said
How he must have loved you
Armand suddenly grips Louis close to him
Louis,  need you more than he ever did
need a link with this century
The world changes
We do not
Therein lies the irony that ultimately kills us
need you to make contact with this age
Louis laughs bitterly
He
Don't you see
'm not the spirit of any age
'm at odds with everything and always have been
'm not even sure what  am
Armand smiles
But Louis, that is the very spirit of your age
The heart of it
You fall from grace has been the fall of a century
Louis is stunned
And the vampires of the Theatre
Like moths around the candle of the age
Decadent, useless
They can't reflect anything
But you do
You reflect its broken heart
Louis is speechless
Are these not the answers you came for
(softly) Yes
My God
vampire with a human soul
An immortal with a mortal's passion
You are beautiful, my friend
Lestat must have wept when he made you - Lestat
You knew Lestat
Yes  knew him
Knew him well enough not to mourn his passing
Armand stands
He takes Louis by the arm, leads him towards the back wall
But you must go now
You must get her safely out of Paris
He opens a hidden door in the wall
No-one else knows of this door
When you knock you will find me waiting
- Louis, in the street outside, as the door closes behind him
(
) felt a kind of peace at last had found the teacher which Lestat could never,  knew now, have been
knew knowledge would never be withheld by Armand
It would pass through him as through a pane of glass
And  knew Claudia must leave me
- Louis enters
There is unfamiliar scent in the air, a doll sitting by the mirror
Louis looks in the mirror and sees
The doll-maker, resplendent in green taffeta, sitting like a Madonna with Claudia on her lap
Claudia's arms are wound round her neck
The contrast between mortal woman and immortal child is plain
Madeleine
Louis is shy
Madeleine rises and comes towards Louis
She draws back the lace fringes round her throat, so he can see the two marks there
She says softly, dreamily
Drink
Louis turns away
Claudia speaks, icy, from the bed
Do it Louis
Because  cannot do it
haven't the strength
You saw to that when you made me
Louis turns to Madeleine
You haven't the vaguest conception under God of what you ask
Au contraire, monsieur,  have
Louis pushes her away
Claudia screams
You have found your new companion, Louis
You will make me mine
Louis grips Madeleine and shakes her
How do we seem to you
Do you think us beautiful, magical, our white skin, our fierce eyes
Drink, you ask me
Have you any idea of the thing you will become
Your evil is that you cannot be evil
And  will suffer for it no longer
Don't make me, Claudia
cannot do it
Yet you could do it to me
Snatching me from my mother's hands like two monsters in a fairy-tale
Couldn't you have waited
Six more years and  would have had that shape
And now you weep
You haven't tears enough for what you've done to me
She points to Madeleine You give her to me
Do this before you leave me
She begins to weep, sobbing like a child
Oh God
love you still, that's the torment of it
But you know must leave you Louis
Yes
And who will care for me my love, my dark angel, when you are gone
Louis looks at Madeleine You promise to care for her then
Yes
And you know what you ask for
She wraps her arms around Claudia
Yes
What do you think she is, Madeleine
doll
child who can't die
Her finger clutches a locket around her neck, Louis touches it, opens it
picture of a young girl, Claudia's age, wistful, beautiful
(softly) And the child who did die
My daughter
Louis takes her chin in his hand, gently
Look at the gaslight
Don't take your eyes off it
You will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive
Do you hear me
Yes
Louis pulls her to him and starts to drink her blood
- Louis on the balcony, weakened terribly
breeze blows on the gauze curtains behind him, through which we see
of Madeleine and Claudia
Madeleine her arms outstretched, now a vampire, a long moan of pain coming from her
Claudia comes through the curtains, alarmed
(whispers) Louis
Louis speaks without turning
She is dying
It happened to you too, but your child's mind can't remember
But if she dies
It's only mortal death
He turns to look at Claudia
Bear me no ill will, my love
We are now even
What do you mean
What died tonight inside that room was not that woman
It will take her many nights to die, perhaps years
What has died in that room tonight is the last vestige in me of what was human
She takes his hand
Yes father
At last
We are een
He bends down and kisses her
He looks up, at the wafting curtains
He sees - Silhouetted, coming closer
Looks up and screams
Are ripped aside
The vampires of the Theatre surge through
Time for justice, little one
The vampires close on them as Louis struggles, Claudia's scream pierces the night air
- In a press of vampires, Louis, Claudia and Madeleine are forced down the dark corridor
Into - Vampire chaos, as they are dragged through
Louis struggling like a demon
Armand
Get me Armand
he wouldn't countenance this - You can make no demands here
Buffoon
Bastard - Santiago strikes Louis to the ground
As he struggles to his feet, he sees the vampires part around a figure coming through
He gasps at the sight of - Dressed beautifully, but horribly scarred now, from the fire as well as the earlier stabbing
Lestat is confused, ancient, teetering, reaching for Santiago's shoulder to steady himself
Louis
Is he the one
Lestat shakes his head
No, the child
The child was the one
All the murderers
You are alive, Lestat
It can't be murder
Tell them how you treated us
Lestat reaches out to Louis
No
You come back to me Louis
Are you mad
The sentence is death
To all of them
Only the girl - it was the girl - The sound of something being dragged through the crowd
Horrible echoing, scraping - Lestat grips Santiago
You promised me -  could take him back to New Orleans - Louis - there's something  must tell you - about that night - that night  met you - He stares around him, confused
The scraping gets louder
You let her go, Lestat - you let her free - and 'll come back with you - Santiago grabs Louis by the neck
Death for the others
For you eternity in a box - We see now what caused the scraping
huge metal coffin being dragged through the vampires
Claudia screams
Walled in a dungeon
Your only company will be your screams
Perhaps it will take centuries
The vampires grab Louis
They force him towards the coffin
Lestat struggles with them
He's coming home with me - you promised - (laughing) We promised nothing
Louis struggles fiercely as he is forced into the coffin
Claudia weeps
They've fooled you, Lestat
You must reach Armand
Armand has the power
Louis, struggling in the coffin
Then the lid is forced down, huge locks closed over it
Louis, in the smallest imaginable space
Beating his forehead against the metal
Claudia, throwing herself on the coffin, crying
She is dragged away
Vampire hands drag the coffin across the stone floor
Louis, forehead pouring with blood, being thrown this way and that
The coffin is lifted, upside down, Louis' head crashes off the floor
Is thrust into a niche in the wall
Bricks being placed over, mortar trowelled on
Louis upside down
Sounds of bricks and mortar
Then terrifying, unearthly scream pierces the coffin, striking to his very soul
Claudia
He loses consciousness
Louis sleeps, upside down
Sound of bricks being broken, thrown aside
Then of locks breaking
Louis opens his eyes
The lid opens
He sees - Above him, reaching down to take his hand
Hurry
Don't make a sound
Louis gets out, into a vast long catacomb
Louis runs to the end of it, steps through a broken brick wall
Where is she
Where's Claudia
Follow me - that way - through my cell - He points to his cell at the end of the passage, the foot of the steps
Sound of rain beyond the door
Not without Claudia
Where is she
can't save her
You can't believe 'd leave without her
Armand
You must save her
You have no choice
Louis,  can't save her
will only risk losing you - Louis runs up the stone stairs
It leads to the ballroom
He enters
Estelle stands far off, looking at him coolly
She lifts the stage skull mask and laughs softly behind it
male vampire slumps in a chair staring softly at Louis
Silence
Indifference
Louis sees Lestat sitting in a far corner
he rushes up to Lestat, who looks up at him, confused
He's holding something crumpled, made of cloth
You'll come home with me Louis
For a little while
until  am myself again
Louis turns round and round in rage
Passive still faces
door bangs open and shut
Louis looks again at Lestat
He snatches the cloth from Lestat's hand
We see it is a small torn bloodstained dress
Claudia's dress
The door bangs again
Estelle laughs
Rain gusts into the ballroom
Louis goes to the door, holding the dress
Armand approaches, trying to pull him away, but Louis shrugs him off
He draws nearer and nearer and stairs at - On the stones lie Claudia and Madeleine, burn to ashes, in each other's arms, like the corpses of his wife and daughter in the New Orleans graveyard, embracing each other
Only Claudia's blond hair and Madeleine's red hair remain unburnt
Louis looks up at the walls of this airwell, many stories to the sky
He cries out in agony
Santiago appears behind him, staring
Louis roars in horror and attacks Santiago, scattering the ashes into the rainy wind
Claudia's golden locks fly up into the wind, they whirl around the warring figure
Armand appears, drags Louis free, pulls him screaming from the airwell, into the ballroom, towards the exit
Claudia's hair is sucked up by the wind through the airwell, towards the night sky
- Louis is slumped against the stone wall
Armand stands beside him like a guardian angel
couldn't prevent it
don't believe you
do not have to read your soul to know that you lie
Louis, they cannot be brought back
There are some things that are impossible, even for me
You let them do it
Louis climbs to his feet
You held sway over them
They feared you
You wanted it to happen
Louis,  swear  did not
understand you only too well
You let them do it, as  let Lestat turn a child into a demon
As  let her rip Lestat's heart to pieces
Well  am no longer that passive fool that has spun evil from evil till the web traps the one who made it
Your melancholy spirit of this century
know what  must do
And warn you - you saved me tonight, so  return the favor - do not go near your cell in the Theatre Des Vampires again
- Wet and deserted, the streets around the theatre are quiet
- Chiming five a
m
Looking at the paling sky
He is in an alleyway, outside of Armand's cell
He has a huge keg with him
he finds the door unlocked
He enters
Empty
The hearth is cold
The old coffin is gone
Louis silently closes the door to the passage and blocks it with an immense bar
He goes in the other door
Louis hurls kerosene all over the stage, the curtain, the sets, the seats below
He grabs the scythe from the playlet
He walks out
Dribbling a trail of kerosene behind him
Louis walking rapidly down, leaving the trail of kerosene
He creeps quietly into the - Leaking kerosene from the cask
He splashes over the coffins that gleam in the dimness
Then he strikes a match and heaves it into the kerosene
Everything bursts into flame
The trail of kerosene roars into fire through the ballroom over the coffins and up the stairs
We hear  of fire from above
Shudders all over, fighting the morning weakness
He readies the scythe, like the grim reaper
Rises from her burning coffin, screams and tries to run through the fire but Louis slashes her down with the scythe and she goes down screaming, her dress in flames
Stop him
It's morning
The sunlight
Stop him
Others rise, choking in the smoke
Screams from everywhere
They are burning
Louis backs up the stairs to the - He can see there a thin pale light under Armand's bolted door
Suddenly - Comes at him from behind
Louis turns
Santiago rushes him in a blur
Louis swings the scythe, too fast to see what he himself is doing
Santiago's head streaming blood flies through the air
The body drops, flapping its arms
come from everywhere
Another vampire rushes burning towards Louis
He decapitates him in turn
Then he staggers into Armand's cell, and bars the door the connects it to the ballroom behind him
He staggers to the outer door
There is a thin strip of daylight, beneath the door, blinding him
He throws it open, and staggers into the daylight
- Louis staggers out of the burning theatre, into the thin daylight
Great gusts of smoke cover the street
He staggers through the daylight, weakening, about to fall, when through the clouds of smoke comes - As in a dream, driven by Armand's human boy
The door of the hearse opens
Through the curtains enclosing the interior, we see Armand
He reaches a hand out to Louis and pulls him inside
The hearse vanishes through the smoke, leaving the spectacle of the burning theatre
- The gutted Theatre and ballroom, the roof collapsed, exposed to the evening sky
The life of Paris goes on around it, oblivious
- It is already a museum by this time and Louis and Armand, fancily dressed and composed, walk through it
They stop by a Gericault - The Wreck of the Medusa
You didn't even warm them, did you
No
And yet you knew what  would do
knew
rescued you, didn't
From the terrible dawn
You were their leader
They trusted you
You made me see their failings, Louis
You made me look at them with your eyes
He looks at Louis affectionately
Your melancholy eyes
What a pair we are
We deserve each other, don't we
We are a pair, and that's what counts
Armand and Louis walk slowly through the Louvre together
Camera follows them for a while, then comes to rest on a sunrise by Turner
(
) We left Paris shortly after
For years we wandered
Greece, Egypt, all the ancient lands
Then, out of curiosity, perhaps, boredom, who knows what,  took him home, to my America
- deco cinema of the twenties
Louis and Armand, dressed in the style of the period walk down the aisle through the crowded seats
(
) And there, a technological wonder allowed me see sunrise, for the first time in two hundred years
On the screen, Murnau's "Sunrise", in black and white
We see a montage of sunrises, from a whole range of movies, in black and white
(
) And what sunrises
Seen as the human eye could never see them
We would sit in the dark, night after night among nameless humans, entranced with the miracle of light
Silver at first, then as the years progressed in tones of purple, red and my long-lost blue
The  continue, in color now, and the backgrounds in them change to the fifties
(
) And in time parted
We had become so alike, we both wanted the certainties of loneliness once more
The lights come up in a different theatre
Louis sitting there, alone, in a half empty theatre, dressed in the clothes of the fifties
He rises, exits with the others
- Cars rushing by, twentieth-century madness
Louis emerges from the theatre, walks through the streets
(
) had returned to new Orleans
As soon as  smelt the air,  knew was home
There was sadness there, rich, almost sweet, like the fragrance of jasmine
walked the streets, savoring it like a long lost perfume
- Louis walks past the many Greek Revival Mansions
(
) And then on Prytania Street, only blocks from the Lafayette cemetery caught the scent of death and it wasn't coming from the graves
white-walled Lafayette cemetery and its surrounding mansions
(
) The scent grew stronger as walked
Old death
scent too faint for mortals to detect
Louis sees rats darting across the street
They rush into a great overgrown garden surrounding a ruined mansion
No lights
Louis stops at a rusted gate
He forces it open and enters - Of overgrown rose and oak tree and wisteria
he sees a faint glimmer of light coming from a distant glass window of a huge Greek Revival house
He approaches then he sees - Of a man, long dead and dried up, snagged in the thorny rosevines
Looks around
Walks on
Sees another corpse, almost nothing but bones, sinking into the wet earth, the roots of an oak overgrowing it
He looks up at the distant light
He passes a third corpse, caught in wisteria and rose vine, only bones and clothes
(
) They were like the doomed princess caught in the thorny vines of Sleeping Beauty's castle
knew what it meant
vampire had lured them here, but had been to weak to get rid of them
Louis sees dead rats lying near the steps
(
) It spelt weakness, madness, the behavior of a dying animal that pollutes its own lair
Louis treads carefully on the rotted steps
he moves along the porch
More dead rats
He sees through the floor-length window into rooms lined with stacked books
Virtually walled with them
Water seeps down from the ceiling, gleaming as it streaks over the books
The floors of the splendid rooms are bare, except for a rotten French chair by a dead fireplace single mirror reflecting the moon
Dead rats
He moves along the porch to the parlor windows
The candle flickers inside
He sees - Lestat lying on the floor
He is gaunt to near starvation
All his scars are gone, but he is almost a skeleton and his eyes are enormous in their sockets
His clothes are rags
Blond hair beautiful, as always
' (
) Lestat escaped the fire
(
) He hadn't even been there
And all those years  thought he was dead
One tiny candle stands beside him
He reads an early comic, from the turn of the century
Without turning his head, he speaks
'm so glad you're here Louis
've dreamed of your coming
Don't try to speak
it's alright
didn't mean to let them do it
that Santiago, he tricked me
That's all past, Lestat
Yes
Past
she should never have been one of us
He turns and looks at Louis
Old, fearful, broken
Still beautiful Louis
You always were the strong one
Don't fear me, Lestat
bring you no harm
You've come back to me, Louis
You've come again to me
Louis shakes his head
series of police sirens go by, piercing the night sky
helicopter goes overhead
Red flashes illuminate his face
Lestat shivers, covers his ears
He's terrified
Louis touches him, calming him, until the lights pass over
It's only a siren
can't bear it Louis
The machines out there, that fly and that roar
And such lights
They make the night brighter than the day
And they frighten you
You know  love the dark
But there's no dark anymore
It's false light, Lestat
It can't harm you
If you stayed with me Louis, could venture out
little by little
become the old Lestat
Louis shivers
He releases him
have to go now Lestat
You remember how  was, Louis
the vampire Lestat
Yes
remember
Lestat shivers
tried to tell you Louis
that night in Paris
when  first came to you
no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis
not even you
tried
And the more you tried, the more wanted you
a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart
And how you suffered
need your forgiveness, Louis
You have it
Louis walks slowly away from him
Lestat turns back to his candle, his magazine
You'll come back, Louis
take me out
little by little
and maybe 'll be myself again
bluebottle buzzes by him
His hand shoots out and grabs it, squeezes the blood
(whispering) Yes, Lestat
As he walks through the decayed house
His eyes are expressionless
(
) And my story ends there
But in fact it ended a long time ago, with Claudia's ashes in that theatre
My love died with her
never really changed after that
What became of Lestat  have no idea
go on, night after night
feed on those who cross my path
But all my passion went with her yellow hair
ma a spirit with preternatural flesh
Detached
unchangeable
Empty
-  () Malloy, staring at Louis
No
it can't end like that
But it has
There is no more to tell
But you talk about passion, about longing, about things 'll never know in my life
It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak
And then you tell me it ends like that
Just empty
It's over, 'm telling you
You need a new passion, Louis, a new reason to feel
what a story you've told, you don't understand yourself
Louis looks at the cassettes on the table
Do what you want with it
Learn what you can
Give the story to others
Malloy rises
You have another chance, Louis
Take me
Give me your gift, your power
Louis is slowly horrified, then outraged and angry
Is this what you want
You ask me for this after all 've told you
If  could see what you've seen, feel what you've felt  wouldn't let it end like this
You need a like to the world out there, a connection
then it won't end like this
He stares at Louis
You need me
Louis turns away
Dear God
've failed again, haven't
No
Don't say anymore
The reels are still turning
have but one chance to show you the meaning of what 've said
He looks at the boy
Then suddenly grabs him, lifts him off the floor, bares his terrifying fangs and brings them to his throat
Malloy screams, in involuntary terror
You like it
You like being food for the immortals
You like dying
Is it beautiful
Is it intense
Malloy, now terrified, whispers No
please
Louis drops him
Thank God
Malloy, falls on the floor, terrified
When he looks up, Louis has vanished
Louis
Louis
He looks up at the tape
It is still turning
Holy shit
He shakes his head
He gets up, and with shaking fingers gathers his tapes
He runs out of the room
- Malloy running for his car, a convertible
He leaps in and screeches off through the night
- Malloy whips the car through the tiny streets, in sheer, unfocused terror
Jesus
- Malloy driving with streams of traffic over the bridge
He breathes deeply, to calm himself
He takes a tape from his pocket, and with still shaking hands, sticks it in the deck
(
) (tape) 1791
That's when it happened was twenty-four
Younger then you are now
Suddenly a bony hand shoots out from the back seat, pulls his neck backwards - Sinks his teeth in his neck
' On the wheel, shaking, shuddering, losing their grip
' Bulging, as the life drains out of him
Lestat sucking him like a rat
Swinging free of Malloy's dying hands
Veers wildly into oncoming traffic
Drinks regardless
Coming towards them, about to crush the car
' Grabs the wheel, jerks it as he drinks
Misses the truck by inches
Throws Malloy to one side, climbs into the front seat
The tape is playing
(
) (tape) My invitation was open to anyone
Sailors, whores, thieves
But it was a vampire that accepted
At the wheel, the corpse of Malloy in the passenger seat
He smiles
We can see the blood renewing him
Dear Louis
will  ever forget
- Lestat drives on, the car a tiny speck against the bridge, the sea, the sky beyond, with the first fingers of light spreading through it
