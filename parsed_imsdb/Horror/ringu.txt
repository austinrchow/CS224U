Sunday
- on a
Theres a baseball game on, but the sound is turned completely down
Camera  to show two cute high school girls,  and
Masami is seated on the floor at a low coffee table,  in front of her
Tomoko is at her desk
There are all over the room, and its obvious there hasnt been much studying going on
Masami is currently in mid-story, speaking excitedly
They say that some elementary school kid spent the night with his parents at a bed and breakfast in Izu
The kid wanted to go out and play with everybody, right, but he didnt want to miss the program he always used to watch back in Tokyo, so he records it on the  in their room
But of course the stations in Izu are different from the ones in Tokyo
In Izu, it was just an empty channel, so he shouldve recorded nothing but static
But when the kid gets back to his house and watches the tape, all of a sudden this woman comes on the screen and says-- Masami points so suddenly and dramatically at her friend that Tomoko actually jumps in her seat
(contd) One week from now, you will die
Short silence as Masami pauses, relishing the moment
(contd) Of course the kids completely freaked, and he stops the video
Just then the phone rings, and when he picks it up a voice says-- Her voice drops voice almost to a whisper
(contd) You watched it, didnt you
That same time, exactly one week later
hes dead
Masami laughs loudly, thoroughly enjoying her own performance
Tomoko, however, is completely silent
She begins looking more and more distressed, until finally Masami notices
What is it, Tomoko
Tomoko comes out of her chair and drops onto the floor next to her friend
Her words are quick, earnest
Who did you hear that story from
Who
Its just a rumor
Everybody knows it
Youko told you
No, it wasnt Youko
Tomoko looks away, worried
Masami slaps her on the knee, laughing
Whats up with you
Tomoko speaks slowly, still looking away
The other day,
watched this strange video
Where
With Youko and them
(excited) So thats what Ive been hearing about you doing some double-date/ sleepover thing
So, you and that guy Iwata, huh
No, its not like that
Nothing happened
Their eyes meet and Tomoko half-blushes, looks away again
Her expression becomes serious as she resumes her conversation
Iwata
he found this weird video
Everyone was like, Whats that
so he put it on and we all watched it
(quietly) And
What kind of video was it
Just
weird,  cant really explain it
Anyway, right after we finished watching it, the phone rang
Whoever it was didnt say anything, but still
Silence
Masami curls up on herself, thoroughly spooked
Jesus
It's cuz, you know, we'd all heard the rumors
Tomoko looks seriously over at her friend
(cont'd) That was one week ago today
There is a long, heavy silence as neither of them says anything
Waaait a minute
Are you faking me out
Tomokos face suddenly breaks into a smile
Busted, huh
They both crack up laughing
Oh, my
cant believe you
Masami reaches out, slaps her friend on the knee
(contd) Youre terrible
Gotcha
(thinking) But hang on
you really stayed the night with Youko and Iwata, right
Tomoko nods, uh-huh
Masami dives forward, pinching her friends cheeks and grinning wildly
So, how far did you and he get
Oh
cant remember
You cant remember, huh
Masami laughs, then slaps Tomoko on the knee again as she remembers the trick her friend played on her
Man, you had me freaked me out
-- Just at that moment, the phone
They are both suddenly, instantly serious
Tomokos eyes go off in one direction and she begins shaking her head, -No-
Masami looks over her shoulder, following her friends gaze
Tomoko is looking at the , which currently reads 9:40
The phone continues to ring
Tomoko is now clutching tightly onto her friend, looking panicked
(softly) Was it true
Tomoko nods her head, still holding on tightly
Masami has to forcibly disengage herself in order to stand
The phone is downstairs, so Masami opens the bedroom  and races down the
Tomoko calls out to her from behind
Masami
- Tomoko and Masami run down the staircase, through the hallway towards the kitchen
Tomoko cries out again just before they reach the kitchen
Masami
- Masami has come to a halt before a  mounted on the wall
She pauses, looking slowly at her friend, then back to the phone
She takes it tentatively from its cradle, answers it wordlessly
The tension continues to mount as nothing is said
Masami suddenly breaks into a huge grin
Ill put her on
Still grinning, she hands the phone to Tomoko
Tomoko snatches it quickly
(softly) Yes
She is silent for a moment, then smiling widely
Oh, man
She is so relieved that all the strength seeps out of her and she sinks to the kitchen floor
Masami, equally relieved, slides down the wall and sits down next to her
(on the phone) Yeah, Ive got a friend over now
Yeah
Yeah,
Bye
Tomoko stands to place the phone back in its wall cradle, and then squats back down onto the kitchen floor
The games gone into overtime, so theyre gonna be a little late
They burst out laughing with relief again, and are soon both clutching their stomachs
Jeeezus, my parents
Oh man, Im tellin everybody about this tomorrow
Tomoko shakes her head, -Dont you dare-
Im gonna use your bathroom
Dont go anywhere
Masami walks out of the kitchen
Alone now, Tomoko stands and walks toward the , where she takes a  from the
She then goes to the  and sticks her face in, looking for something to drink
Suddenly there is the  of people clapping and cheering
Tomoko, startled, peers her head over the refrigerator door to check for the source of the sound
She begins walking slowly, following the sound to the adjacent the kitchen
-   - The lights are off, and there is no one in the room
Tomoko pauses a moment, bathed in the garish  from the , which has been switched on
Playing is the same baseball game they had on the  upstairs; the same game that Tomokos parents are currently at
The  is up quite high
puzzled look on her face, Tomoko takes the  from the coffee table and flicks the  off
She walks back to the kitchen
- bottle of  that Tomoko had earlier taken from the fridge is on the kitchen table
She picks the bottle up, pours herself a drink
Before she can take a sip, however, the air around her becomes suddenly charged, heavy
Her body begins to shiver as somewhere out of sight comes a popping, crackling  underscored by a kind of
Trembling now, Tomoko spins around to see what she has already felt lurking behind her
She draws in her breath to scream
The screen goes white, and fades into: The screen is filled with the visage of a nervous-looking
She is being interviewed by , a female reporter seated offscreen
(
) There seems to be a popular rumor going around about a cursed videotape
Uh-huh
(
) Have you heard what kind of video it might be
Uh-huh
The girl looks directly at the camera, her mouth dropping into an as shes suddenly overcome by a kind of stage fright
She continues staring, silently, at the camera
- , the cameraman, has lowered his camera
We can now see that the young girl being interviewed is seated at a table between two friends, a -  (#2) and a -  ( #3)
They are all dressed in the  of junior high school students
Opposite them sits Komiya and Asakawa, a pretty woman in her mid- twenties
stands to the left
Uh, dont look right at the camera, Sorry
Lets do it again
Asakawa glances over her shoulder, makes sure that Komiya is ready
Have you heard what kind of video it might be
What  heard was, all of a sudden this scaaarry lady comes on the screen and says, In one week, you will die
#2 heard that if youre watching late at night itll come on, and then your phonell ring
Watching  late at night
do you know what station
#2 Mmmm
heard some local station, around Izu
Izu
#2 Mmm-hmm
And, do you know if anyones really died from watching it
The girl flashes a look at her two friends
Well, no one that we know, right
Girl #2 nods her head
Girl #3 nods slowly, opens and closes her mouth as if deciding whether to say something or not
The reporter notices
What is it
#3 heard this from a friend of mine in high school
She said that there was this one girl who watched the video, and then died a week later
She was out on a drive with her boyfriend
They were in a wreck
#3 No, their car was parked, but they were both dead inside
Her boyfriend died because hed watched the video, too
Thats what my friend said
Girl #3 grows suddenly defensive
#3 (contd) Its true
It was in the paper two or three days ago
Do you know the name of the high school this girl went to
#3 No
heard this from my friend, and it didnt happen at her school
She heard it from a friend at a different school, she said
Asakawa is seated at her
The station is filled with , scrabbling to meet deadlines
Komiya walks up to Asakawas desk and holds out a
Mrs
Asakawa
Hm
Here you are
(taking the folder) Thanks
Komiya has a seat
This same kind of thing happened about ten years ago too, didnt it
Some popular young singer committed suicide, and then suddenly there was all this talk about her ghost showing up on some music show
But  wonder what this rumors all about
Everyone you ask always mentions Izu
Maybe thats where it all started
Hey, where was that Kuchi-sake Onna * story from again
>* Literally Ripped-Mouth Lady, a kind of ghastly spectre from >Japanese folk stories who wears a veil to hide her mouth, which >has been ripped or cut open from ear to ear
She wanders the >countryside at night asking men Do you think Im beautiful
then >lowering her veil to reveal her true features
Gifu, but there was some big accident out there, and that ended up being what started the rumor
big accident
Mmm-hmm
Something terrible like that is going to stay in peoples minds
Sometimes the story of what happened gets twisted around, and ends up coming back as a rumor like this one
Thats what they say, at least
Dyou think something like that happened out at Izu
Maybe
Well, anyway, Im off
See you tomorrow
See you
Asakawa gets up from her desk and begins walking towards the exit
She takes only a few steps before noticing a  of recent She takes one from the rack, sets it on a nearby
She begins flipping the pages, and suddenly spies this story: The bodies of a young man and woman were discovered in their passenger car at around 10
September 6th
The location was a vacant lot parallel to Yokohama Prefectural Road
Local authorities identified the deceased as a 19-year old preparatory school student of Tokyo, and a 16-year old Yokohama resident, a student of a private all-girls high school
Because there were no external injuries, police are investigating the possibility of drug-induced suicide
Just then two men walk by, a      and a youngish intern named
Okazaki is carrying an armload of
, Okazaki, Im counting on you
Yessir
The guy in the suit pats Okazaki on the shoulder and walks off
Okazaki turns to walk away, spots Asakawa bent over the small table and peering intently at the newspaper article
Miss Asakawa
thought you were going home early today
Asakawa turns around and begins speaking excitedly
Okazaki, can  ask you a favor
Sure
Asakawa points to the newspaper
Could you check out this article for me
Get me some more info
guess
Good
Call me as soon as you know more,
Maam
Asakawa walks off
Okazaki, still carrying the videotapes, leans forward to take a look at the article
- Asakawa drives her car into the lot and parks quickly
She gets out, runs up the  to the third floor
She stops in front of a door, sticks her  in the lock, and opens it
- of about 7 is sitting in an  facing the veranda
We can see only the back of his head
(
) Yoichi
Hearing his name, the boy puts down the  he was reading and stands up, facing the door
He is wearing a white   with a brown sweater-type  over it
He sees Asakawa, his mother, run in the door
She is panting lightly
Sorry Im late
Oh, youve already changed
Yup
He points over to his mothers right
(contd) got your clothes out for you
Asakawa turns to see a   hanging from one of the living room shelves
She reaches out, takes it
Aargh, weve gotta hurry
She runs into the next room to change
Asakawa has changed into all-black
Her hair is up, and she is fastening the clasp to a pearl
Yoichi is still in the living room
Did grandpa call
(
) Nope
Yoichi walks into the room and faces his mother
Why did Tomo-chan die
* >* -chan is a suffix in Japanese that denotes closeness or affection
>It is most often used for young girls, though it can also be used for >boys
Well
it looks like she was really, really sick
She takes a seat on the bed
Will you do me up
Yoichi fastens the rear button of his mothers dress and zips her up
You can die even if youre young
If its something serious
well, yes
Asakawa turns to face her son, puts an arm around him
As hard as it is for us, what your auntie and uncle are going through right now is even harder, so lets not talk about this over there,
Yoichi nods
(remembering) You and her used to play a lot together, didnt you
Yoichi says nothing
- mark this place as the site of a wake
Several in high school uniforms are standing together and talking in groups
Asakawa and Yoichi, walking hand in hand, enter the house
- There are many  milling about, speaking softly
seated at a counter is taking monetary donations from guests and entering their information into a
Asakawa and Yoichi continue walking, down a hallway
- Mother and son halt before the open  to the main wake room, where guests may show their respects to the departed
The room is laid in traditional Japanese-style tatami, a kind of woven straw mat that serves as a carpet
Two , their shoes off, are kneeling upon zabuton cushions
Kneeling opposite the guests is , Asakawas father
The two guests are bowing deeply, and Kouichi bows in response
Dad
Kouichi turns to see her
Ah
How is sis holding up
Shes resting inside right now
Shes shaken up pretty badly, you know
Its best she just take things easy for a while
Asakawa nods
Ill go check on auntie and them, then
Ah, Yoichi
Why dont you sit here for a little while
He grabs the young boy and seats him on a cushion next to the two guests
As the guests resume their conversation with Asakawas father, Yoichis eyes wander to the  at the front of the room set up to honor the deceased
It is made of wood, and surrounded by candles, flowers, and small paper lanterns
At the center is a  of the deceased, a teenage girl
small wooden  reads her name: Tomoko Ouishi
It is the same Tomoko from the first scene
Yoichi continues to stare at Tomokos picture
He makes a peculiar gesture as he does so, rubbing his index finger in small circles just between his eyes
Asakawa walks down the hallway, looking for her aunt
She walks until finding the open doorway to the kitchen
There are a few people in there, preparing busily
Asakawa sees her , who rushes into the hallway to meet her, holds her fast by the arm
The aunt speaks in a fierce, quick whisper
Have you heard anything more about Tomo-chans death
No,
But the police have already finished their autopsy
Well, they said there was no sign of foul play
(shaking her head) That was no normal death
They havent once opened the casket to let us see the body
Dont you think thats strange
Asakawa looks away, thinking
Yoichi has wandered off by himself
He stops at the foot of the steps, looking up-- and catches a glimpse of a pair of running up to the second floor
guarded expression on his face, Yoichi walks slowly up the stairs
-   - Yoichi has wandered into Tomokos bedroom
The lights are all off, and there is an eerie feel to it
Yoichis eyes wander about the room, finally coming to rest on the
Suddenly, he hears his mothers voice from behind him
(
) Yoichi
Yoichi turns to face her as she approaches, puts an arm around him
What are you doing up here
You shouldnt just walk into other peoples rooms
Without replying, Yoichis gaze slowly returns to the television set
Asakawa holds him by the shoulders, turning him to meet her
You go on downstairs,
He turns to leave, and Asakawa follows
- Just as Yoichi and Asakawa are about to descend the steps, Asakawas   rings
She opens the clasp to her
(to Yoichi) You go on ahead
He walks down the steps
Asakawa brings out her cell phone, answers it
Hello
Uh
this is Okazaki
Ive got some more info on that article for you
The girl was a student of the uh, Seikei School for Women in Yokahama City
Asakawa blinks at this, looks disturbed
(softly) Thanks
She hangs up the phone
- Asakawa stands now at the entrance of the house
Dazedly, she walks toward a large, hand-painted
The placard reads that the wake is being held for a student of the Seikei School for Women
Asakawa stares at that placard, making the mental connections
She turns abruptly, walks towards a nearby  of Excuse me
This is, um, kind of a strange question, but by any chance were you friends of that young girl that died in the car as well
The three girls turn their faces to the ground
Please
If you know anything
They all died the same day
Youko
Tomoko
Even Iwata, he was in a motorcycle accident
Because they watched the video
Video
Thats what Youko said
They all watched some weird video, and after that their phone rang
Tomoko-chan watched it, too
Where
Girl Left shakes her head
She just said they all stayed somewhere
There was a girl with Tomoko when she died
Shes had to be hospitalized for shock
They say she wont go anywhere near a television
- Asakawa and , another news reporter, are watching scenes from the Yokohama car death
In the footage there are lots of milling about, one of them trying to pick the door to the passenger side
Yoshino is giving Asakawa the blow-by-blow
The bodies of those found were Tsuji Youko, age 17, a student of the Seikei School for Women, and Nomi Takehiko, age 19, preparatory school student
Both their doors were securely locked
Onscreen, the policeman has finally picked the lock
The door opens, and a girls  halffalls out, head facing upwards
Yoshino flicks a  on the control panel, scans the footage frame by frame
He stops when he gets a good close-up of the victim
Her face is twisted into an insane rictus of fear, mouth open, eyes wide and glassy
Yoshino and Asakawa lean back in their seats
This is the first time Ive -ever- seen something like this
Cause of death
Couldnt say, aside from sudden heart failure
Drugs
The autopsy came up negative
Yoshino takes the video off pause
Onscreen, a policeman has caught the young girls body from completely falling out, and is pushing it back into the car
As the body moves into an upright position, we can see that the girls  are mid-way around her left thigh
These two, about to go at it, suddenly up and die for no apparent reason
He sighs
(contd) Do -you- get it
- Asakawas  is already halted before a modest-sized, two-story with a small covered parkway for a garage
She gets out of her car, closes the door
She stares at the house, unmoving
- Asakawa stands before her  , who is seated at the kitchen Ryomi is staring blankly away, making no sign of acknowledging her sister
The silence continues unabated, and Asakawa, pensive, wanders idly into the adjoining dining room
She takes a long look at the television, the same television that had puzzled Tomoko by suddenly switching itself on, sitting darkly in one corner
Her reflection in the screen looks stretched, distorted
(
) They tell me that Yoichi came to the funeral, too
Asakawa steps back into the kitchen
She addresses her sister, who continues to stare out at nothing
Mmm-hmm
They used to play a lot together, didnt they
Upstairs
Yeah
Ryomi lapses back into a silence
Asakawa waits for her to say more, but when it is clear that nothing else is forthcoming, she quietly gives up and exits the kitchen
- Asakawa climbs the steps to the second floor
She makes her way down the hall
-   - As if intruding, Asakawa walks slowly, cautiously into Tomokos room
The window to the room is open, and a single piece of folded white on Tomokos desk flutters in the breeze
Asakawa walks towards it, picks it up
It is a  from a photo shop
The developed photos have yet to be claimed
Asakawa senses something, spins to look over her shoulder
Her sister has crept quietly up the stairs and down the hall, and stands now in the doorway to Tomokos room
She appears not to notice what Asakawa has in her hands, as her gaze has already shifted to the sliding closet door
She regards it almost druggedly
(haltingly) This
this is where Tomoko died
(
) Tomoko
Ryomis hands fling aside the
Within, she finds the pale blue  of her daughter, curled up into an unnatural fetal position
Tomokos mouth yawns gaping, her eyes glassy and rolled up into the back of her head
Her hands are caught in her hair, as if trying to pull it out by the roots
It is a horrific scene, one that says Tomoko died as if from some unspeakable fear
Ryomi sinks to her knees, hitting the wooden floor hard
She puts her face into her hands and begins sobbing loudly
Asakawa says nothing
Asakawa leaves the camera shop clutching Tomokos unclaimed
She walks out onto the sidewalk and begins flipping through them
We see Tomoko standing arm-in-arm with Iwata, her secret boyfriend
Tomoko and her friends eating lunch
The camera had its date-and-time function enabled, and the photos are marked 97 8 29
The next shot is of Tomoko, Iwata, and another young couple posing in front of a  for a bed and breakfast
The sign reads: Izu
Asakawa continues looking through the photos, various shots of the four friends clowning around in their room
Suddenly she comes to a shot taken the next day, at check out
The friends are lined up, arms linked-- and all four of their faces are blurred, distorted as if someone had taken an eraser to them and tried to rub them out of existence
- Asakawa wears an , and is frying something up on the
Yoichi stands watching
Look, Im probably going to be late coming home tonight, so just stick your dinner in the microwave when youre ready to eat,
Mom
Hmm
Tomo-chan watched some cursed video
Asakawa leaves the food on the stove, runs over to Yoichi and grabs him by the shoulders
She shakes him roughly
What did you say
You are not to speak of this at school, do you hear me
(utterly unfazed) wont
Im going to school now
Yoichi walks off
Asakawa goes back to the stove, but stops after only a few stirs, staring off and thinking
Caption-- September 13th
Monday
Asakawa drives her car speedily along a narrow country road, blowing up in her wake
- Asakawa mutters to herself, deep in thought
Theres no way
Asakawas car drives past a sign reading: - Asakawa has left her car and is walking around the driveway of what is less a bed and breakfast and more like a series of cabin-style rental She wanders about for a while, trying to get her bearings
She pauses now in front of a particular cottage and reaches into her
She withdraws the  from the photomat, the one that showed Tomoko and her friends with their faces all blurred
The four are posing in front of their cottage, marked in the photograph as B4
Asakawa lowers the photo to regard the cottage before her
B4 She walks to the door, turns the handle experimentally
Its open
Asakawa walks in
-  B4 Asakawa lets her eyes wander around the cottage
It looks very modern, all wood paneling and spacious comfort
Her eyes rest on the / setup at the front of the room
Crouching before the  now, she presses the eject button
Nothing happens
She fingers the inside of the deck, finds it empty, then reaches behind to the rear of the , searching
Again, there is nothing
Asakawa presses the power button on the television, picks up the , and takes a seat on the
She runs through a few channels but theyre all talk shows, no clues whatsoever
She flicks the  off and leans back in the sofa, sighing
Just then, she spies a  on the coffee table
These things are sometimes left in hotels in Japan, so that guests can write a few comments about their stay for others to read
Asakawa picks the ledger up, begins thumbing through it
She stops at a strange obviously drawn by a child, that shows three rotund, almost entirely round personages
She reads the handwritten
"My dad is fat
My mom is fat
Thats why Im fat, too
" She smiles in spite of herself
Asakawa flips through the rest of the ledger, but theres nothing else of any import
She tosses it back onto the coffee table and, sighing again, leans into the sofa and closes her eyes
- Asakawa eats silently, alone
-   - Asakawa has returned to the bed and breakfast
As she walks in the door, the   rises out of his chair to greet her
Room for one
Um, actually Im here on business
She passes the clerk a picture of Tomoko and her three other friends
He stares at it for a moment
They would have stayed here on August 29th, all four of them
If theres any information you might have
Uh, hang on just a minute
The clerk turns his back to her, begins leafing through a guest log
(to himself) August 29th
While she waits, Asakawas eyes start to wander around the room
Behind the desk is a sign reading Rental Video, and a large wooden filled with
They are all in their original boxes, and she lets her eyes glance over the titles
Raiders of the Lost Ark, 48 Hours-- --and then, suddenly, she spies a  in a plain, unmarked sleeve, tucked away in the back of the very bottom shelf
She feels the hairs on the back of her neck rise
That
The clerk looks up
Hmm
Asakawa stabs a finger excitedly towards the shelf
That
What tape is that
The clerk reaches out for it, grabs it
This
Hmm
The clerk pulls the tape out of its  and checks for a label
Its unmarked
Maybe one of the guests left it behind
B4 - Asakawa flips on the
Its on channel 2, and there is nothing but static
She kneels down to slide the tape into the deck and pauses a moment, framed in the vaguely spectral  from the television screen
Steeling her nerves, she puts the tape into the machine, picks up the remote, and presses play
: This next scene is entirely visual
If you are reading this translation before watching the movie, do yourself a favor; reading this now and watch the scene for itself
Afterwards, you can come back here to check the meaning of the Japanese characters displayed
At first it looks like nothing has happened-- then Asakawa realizes that she is now viewing recorded static instead of broadcast static
She watches, waiting, but the static continues unbroken
Asakawa looks down at the remote, is about to press fast forward, when suddenly the picture on the screen clears and for a moment she thinks shes looking at the moon
Its not the moon at all, she realizes
The shape is round like a full moon, but it seems to be made up of thin  of cloud streaking against a night sky
And theres a , she sees, a face hidden in shadows, looking down from above
What is this
The scene changes now, and Asakawa notes that the tape has that kind of grainy quality one sees in 3rd or 4th generation copies
The scene is of a  brushing her long hair before an oval-shaped
The nerve- wracking grating as if of some giant metallic insect sounds in the background, but the lady doesnt seem to notice
The mirror the lady is using to brush her hair suddenly changes position from the left part of the wall before which she stands, to the right
Almost instantly the mirror returns to its original position, but in that one moment in its changed location we see a small  in a white
The woman turns towards where that figure stood, and smiles
The screen next becomes a twitching, undulating impenetrable sea of the kanji characters used in the Japanese language
Asakawa can pick out only two things recognizable: local     volcanic eruption Now the screen is awash in -- crawling, scrabbling, shambling masses, some of them moving in reverse
sound like moaning accompanies them
stands upon a shore, its face shrouded
It points accusingly, not towards the screen, but at something unseen off to one side
The insect-like screeching sounds louder
-- Close up on inhuman, alien-looking
Inside that eye a single character is reflected in reverse:  , meaning "chastity
" The eye blinks once, twice
The symbol remains
--- long shot of an outdoor, uncovered
---- Sudden loud, blinding  as the tape ends
Asakawa turns the  off, looking physically drained
She sighs shakily and slumps forward, resting on her knees
Just then, she glances at the television screen
She sees, reflected, a small  in a white gown standing at the rear of the room
Shocked, Asakawa draws in breath, spins around
The room is empty
Asakawa runs to the sofa to collect her jacket-- --and the  of the telephone stops her dead in her tracks
Zombie- like, she walks towards the telephone, picks it up wordlessly
From the other end comes the same metallic, insectoid  heard on the video
Asakawa slams the phone down and glances up at the
Its about seven minutes after 7
(to herself) One week
Asakawa grabs her coat, pops the tape out of the deck, and runs out the door
It is dark and raining heavily
Yoichi, Asakawas son, is walking to school,  firmly in hand
The sidewalk is quite narrow, and Yoichi comes to a halt when a second  comes from the opposite direction, blocking his way
Yoichi slowly raises his umbrella, peers up to look at this other pedestrian
It is a , a  slung over one shoulder
He has a beard; unusual for Japan where clean-shaven is the norm
The two continue looking directly at each other, neither moving nor speaking
Yoichi then walks around the persons left and continues on his way
The man resumes walking as well
Caption-- September 14th
Tuesday
- The bearded man, whose name is , reaches out to press the , but the door has already opened from within
Asakawa leans out, holding the door open for him
Neither of them speaks
Wordlessly, Ryuji enters the apartment
- Ryuji puts his bag down, looks around the apartment
The interior is dark, ominous somehow
He takes his  off and wanders into the living room
Asakawa is in the kitchen behind him, preparing
Ryuji spies the collection of   in living room
Yoichis in elementary school already, is he
His first year
What about you, Ryuji
How have you been recently
Same as always
She takes a seat next to him, serves the tea
On the coffee table before them is a  in a plain, unmarked case
And money is
Im teaching at university
Ryuji picks up his cup of tea but stops, grimacing, before it is to his lips
He rubs his forehead as if experiencing a sudden headache
Ryuji shakes it off and quickly regains his composure
Anyway
You said that the phone rang
Thats right
So if  watch it too, that phone over there-- He gestures with his mug (contd) --should ring
Ryuji, four people have already died
On the same day
(flippant) Well, why dont you try calling an exorcist
He takes a sip of his tea
Asakawa reaches quickly, grabs something from the bookshelf behind her-- a
She shoves it into Ryujis hands, then turns to look down at the floor
Take my picture
Ryuji raises the camera to his eye
Turn this way
(unmoving) Hurry up and take it
Ryuji snaps off a shot
It comes out the other end and he takes it, waits impatiently for an image to appear
When it does, all he can do is pass it wordlessly over to Asakawa
Her face is twisted, misshapen
Just like the picture of Tomoko and her friends
Asakawa stares at it, horrified
By the time she finally looks up, Ryuji has already risen from his seat and slid the videotape into the Again, the screen is filled with static, only to be replaced with what looks like the moon
Asakawa slams the Polaroid on the coffee table and goes outside onto the veranda
- Asakawa stares out at a view of the houses shaded in cloud and rain
There is a knock on the glass door behind her
moment later, Ryuji slides the door open
Its over
Asakawa re-enters her apartment
-   - Well, it looks like your phones not ringing
Ryuji pops the tape from the deck, hands it to Asakawa
Make me a copy of this, will you
Id like to do a little research of my own
Theres no reason to write us off as dead just yet
He dramatically takes a seat
(contd) If theres a video, that means that somebody had to make it
Theres the guest list from the cottage to look into
and the possibility of someone hacking into the local stations broadcast signals
Asakawa pulls a  from her purse and begins busily scribbling away
- Okazaki putters around
Caption- September 15th
Tuesday
- Asakawa sits by herself, reviewing the videotape
She is replaying the very last scene, an outdoor shot of a well
She stares at it carefully, and notices
The tape ends, filling the screen with static
split-second afterwards, there is a  on the door and Okazaki enters, holding a
Asakawa momentarily forgets about the video
(handing her the file) Heres that guest list you wanted
Oh, thanks
What are you gonna do with this
Uh
sorry, Im working on something personal
- Some quick shots of a  gushing water,  flapping away looking agitated
to Ryuji sitting on a
Hes deep in thought, writing in a
There are multitudes of  about him, and we can hear the sounds of their coming and going attached to a woman in white dress, hose, and pumps appears, heading directly for Ryuji
Her pace is slow, rhythmical, and as that pace progresses all other sounds  into the background, so that all we can hear is the ,  as those legs walk to stand just before Ryuji
The pumps are scuffed, dirtied with grime
gust of  rips by
Ryuji fights the urge to look up as in his ears rings the same hollowed, multi-voiced  heard on the videotape
The sound grows stronger
() So, it was you
You did it
The babbling fades, disappears as slowly the worlds normal background sounds return
Ryuji looks up, but the woman in white is nowhere to be seen
Ryuji rides up on a
He turns the corner towards his apartment and finds Asakawa seated on the steps, waiting for him
Hey
Asakawa notes in his face that something is wrong
What happened to you
(gruffly) Nothing
He enters the building, carrying his bicycle
Asakawa follows
- The two walk down the hallway towards the   to Ryujis apartment
He unlocks the door and they enter
Ryuji and Asakawa enter the living room
So, whatd you come up with
dont think any of the guests on the list brought the tape with them
couldnt confirm it face-to-face of course, but even over the phone got the feeling they were all being upfront with me
How about the other angle
Pirate signals or
Asakawa shakes her head
Therere no traces of any illegal television signals being broadcast around Izu
She reaches into her purse, pulls out a large white
Heres that copy of the videotape you wanted
Ryuji tears the package open
He squats down on the tatami in frontof his  and slides the tape in
Asakawa sits on the tatami as well, but positions herself away from the  and keeps her eyes averted
Ryuji glares over his shoulder at her
(sternly) Asakawa
She reluctantly scoots closer, looks up at the screen
Ryuji fast-forwards the tape a bit, stopping at the scene where the woman is brushing her long hair before an oval mirror
He puts the video on frame-by-frame
Have you ever seen this woman
Asakawa regards the screen intently
No
The tape advances to the scene where the mirror suddenly changes positions
When it does, we can again see the small figure in the white gown, a figure with long black hair
When Ryuji sees this his body stiffens, becomes tense
Asakawa notices but says nothing
She also notices something else
(excitedly) Theres something strange about this shot
She takes the remote from Ryuji, rewinds it a ways
Onscreen, the woman begins coming her long hair again
From this angle, the mirror should be reflecting whoevers filming
So, what does that mean
Asakawa lets out a short sigh
Well, if the person who made this is a pro, thered be a way around that,  guess, but still
The screen changes, showing the mass of squiggling kanji characters again
(reading) Volcanic eruption
Eruption where
He pauses the screen, trying to make sense of what is written
This is gonna be impossible to figure out on just a regular  screen, dont you think
They are both still staring at the screen when from behind them comes the  of someone opening the front door
Ryuji turns off the , ejects the tape from the deck
Come on in
Asakawa flashes a look at Ryuji and then turns her head back towards the front door to see who has entered
cute, nervous-looking young with short hair approaches slowly
She is carrying a filled with groceries
Asakawa, meet my student, Takano Mai
He turns, addresses Mai
(contd) This is Asakawa, my ex-wife
Ryuji gets up and walks conveniently away
Nice to meet you
Im Takano
Asakawa
* > * As you may already be aware, Japanese name order is the >opposite of Englishs, and even close friends may continue to >address one another by their last names
Incidentally, Asakawas >first name is Reiko
In this scene, Mai deferentially refers >to Ryuji as sensei, meaning teacher
Mai sets the bag of groceries down and chases after Ryuji
He is putting on his jacket and getting ready to leave
Sensei, the people from the publishing company called about the deadline on your thesis again
(brusquely) Whatre they talkin to you about it for
Because they can never get a hold of you
Ryuji picks up his keys, video firmly in hand
Ask them to wait another week
Sensei, ask them yourself, please
Ryuji is already headed for the door
His back is to her as he responds
,
Asakawa walks after him
They leave
Mai pouts unhappily a bit, and then breaks into a smile as an idea crosses her mind
She walks across the room to where Ryuji has set up a large  filled with mathematical equations
Grinning, Mai rubs out part of one equation with her sleeve and writes in a new value
- Asakawa and Ryuji stride purposefully
They stop before a  to the right, which Asakawa unlocks
They both walk in
-   - Asakawa and Ryuji sit in a completely darkened room, their eyes glued to the television
They are again watching the scene with the fragmented kanji characters, but despite their efforts have been able to identify only one additional word, bringing the total to three: volcanic eruption	  local	     residents This is impossible
Ryuji fast forwards, stopping at the scene with the kanji reflected inside an alien-looking
He reads the kanji aloud
Sada
Ryuji moves to make a note of this, notices the time
Is Yoichi gonna be all right
(sadly) Hes used to it
Short silence
Ryuji breaks it by gesturing towards the screen
Whoever made this had to have left some kind of clue behind
Theyre probably waiting for us to find it
Asakawa turns a  to bring up the volume, which up until now has been  on mute
The room is filled with an eerie, metallic , and Asakawa spins the dial again, shutting it off
Just as she does, Ryujis eyes widen
Wait a minute
He turns the dial again, punches a few buttons as if searching for something
He listens carefully, and when he hears that strange something again he stops, looks at the screen
It is paused at the scene with the figure, pointing, a  draped over its head
The figure now looks oddly like a messenger
Ryuji and Asakawa exchange glances
This could be it
Ryuji flips some more switches, setting the sound for super-slow mo
What follows is a strange, labored sort of speech- a hidden message-- framed in the skittering distortion of the tape in slow motion
Shoooomonnn bakkkkkarrri toou
boooouuuukonn ga kuuru zouuu
(repeating) Shoumon bakkari, boukon ga kuru zo
Did you hear that, too
Asakawa nods
Ryuji is already writing it down excitedly
What does that mean
Ryuji tears the sheet of paper off the notepad, folds it, and tucks it into his shirt pocket
Im gonna check it out
- Yoichi is walking to school
He looks back over his shoulder, just once,then resumes walking
- All the lights are turned off, and she is sitting on the living room couch watching the footage of her cafe interview with the junior high school girls
Caption-- September 16th
Thursday
Just when the girl in the interview mentions that whomever watches the video is supposed to afterwards receive a phone call, Asakawas own phone , startling her
She runs to answer it
Hello
(
) Ive got it
Its a dialect, just like  thought
means playing in the water and means monster
* >* Translated from standard Japanese, the phrase from the videotape >would initially have sounded like, "If only  then the > will come
"  These two capitalized words, later identified to >be dialectical, were at the time completely incomprehensible to Ryuji >and Asakawa
Dialect can vary dramatically from region to region in >Japan, to the point of speakers of different dialect being unable to >understand one another
>The phrase on the tape can now be rendered, "If you keep playing in >the water, the monster will come for you
" But, dialect from where
Oshima
And the site of our eruption is Mt
Mihara
- Ryuji and Asakawa are seated at cubicles, looking through bound of old newspaper articles
Asakawa sneaks a look at Ryuji, stands up and walks off a little ways
She has already pulled out her cell phone
(whispering, on phone) Yoichi
Im gonna be a little late tonight, honey
Ryuji looks over his shoulder at her, scowls
You can do it yourself, right
Sorry
Bye
She hangs up, returns to her seat at the cubicle
She resumes her scanning of the newspaper articles, and Ryuji shoots her another scowl
Asakawa turns a page and then stops, frowning
She has spied an article that looks like
Nervously, Asakawa puts the thumb and forefinger of each hand together, forming the shape of a rectangle
Or a screen
She places the rectangle over the article she has just discovered, its headlines reading: Mount Mihara Erupts 	Local Residents Urged to Take Precautions Ryuji notices her, leans forward excitedly
Ive got it
This old article
The two scan the remainder of the page, and find a smaller, related article
Did Local Girl Predict Eruption
young lady from Sashikiji prefecture
The two read over both articles, absorbing the details
Ryuji stands suddenly, gathering his things
What are you doing
Has your newspaper got someone out there at Oshima
think so
There should be a correspondent out there
need you to find out, and let me know how to get hold of him
Tonight
He begins walking briskly away
Asakawa chases after him
What do you think youre--
(angrily) Youve only got four days left, Asakawa
Your newspaper contact and  can handle this from here on out
You just stay with Yoichi
Ryuji strides off
Asakawa stands motionless
- car speeds along
to a gravel  leading up to a wooden, traditional-style
Kouichi, Asakawas father, is standing before the entrance and puttering around in his
The car from the previous shot drives up, comes to a halt
The passenger door opens and Yoichi hops out, running towards the old man
Asakawa walks leisurely after her son
Grandpa
Whoa, there
So, you made it, huh
Caption-- September 17th
Friday
Yoichi says hes looking forward to doing some fishing with you
Is that so
Yoichi begins tugging excitedly at his grandfathers arm
Cmon grandpa, lets go
,
Well get our things together and then we can go
Asakawa stands on a  while her father and Yoichi,  on, are ankle-deep in a shallow river
Yoichi holds a small , and Asakawas dad is pointing and chattering excitedly
There he is
Cmon, there he is, dont let him go
Yoichi tries to scoop up the fish his grandfather is pointing out
Oh, oh
Ah
guess he got away, huh
That was your fault, grandpa
Asakawas father laughs
Well, whaddya say we try again
He begins sloshing noisily out to the center of the stream, Yoichi in tow
Well get im this time
Asakawa looks away, pensive
-   - Yoichi is passed out asleep on the tatami mats
looms inone corner of the living room, but it is switched off
The to the adjacent guest room are open and we can see futons set out, ready for bed
Asakawa enters the living room and, seeing Yoichi, scoops him up in her arms and carries him over to the guest room
(sleepily) How was work, mommy
Asakawa tucks him into the futons and walks silently off
- Asakawa stands at the foot of the staircase, telephone  in hand
The phone rests on a small  by the staircase
Hello
(
) Yeah
Your Oshima contact came through
It looks like the woman who predicted the Mihara eruption is the same woman from the video
Ryuji is crouched in front of the ,  in hand
The screen is paused on the scene of the woman brushing her long hair
Her name is Yamamura Shizuko
She committed suicide forty years ago by throwing herself into Mt
Mihara
- Have you got anything else
(
) Im gonna have to check it for myself
Ill be leaving for Oshima tomorrow morning
Oshima
Ive only got three days left
(
) know
And Ive got four
Short silence
(
) Ill be in touch
Ryuji hangs up
Asakawa, deep in thought, slowly places the phone back in its
She turns around to walk back down the hallway only to find her father standing there, face full of concern
Whats happened
Asakawa shakes her head
Nothing
just had some things left over from work
She walks past her father, who glances worriedly after her over his shoulder
- The lights are all off and Asakawa is asleep in her futon
Her eyes suddenly fly open as a  sounding eerily like her deceased niece Tomoko calls out to her
(
) Auntie
Asakawa looks around the room, gets her bearings
Her eyes fall on the futon next to hers
Yoichi
There is a  in that futon, but it is full-grown, dressed all in black
It is curled into a fetal position and has its head turned away
Suddenly, the  from the video of the figure with its face shrouded springs to Asakawas mind
Just an instant, its pointing visage materializes, and then disappears
It reappears a moment later, pointing more insistently now, and disappears again
Asakawa blinks her eyes and realizes that the futon next to hers is empty
Yoichi is nowhere to be seen
Just then, she hears that high-pitched, metallic  from the video
Eyes wide with horror, she flings the sliding doors apart-- --and there, seated before the television, is Yoichi
He is watching the video
It is already at the very last scene, the shot of the outdoor well
on the screen now, and for just an instant we can see that something is trying to claw its way out of the well
The video cuts off, and the screen fills with static
Shrieking, Asakawa races over to Yoichi, covers his eyes though it is already too late
She scoots over to the , ejects the tape and stares at it uncomprehendingly
She is then at Yoichis side again, shaking him roughly
Yoichi
You brought this with you, didnt you
Why
Tomo-chan
Asakawa freezes, her eyes wide
Tomo-chan told me to watch it
are being kicked up by a large   as it speeds on its way
to Asakawa and Ryuji standing on deck, looking out over the waves
shouldve been more careful
When  was at your place that day,  could feel something there
thought it was just because of the video
You mean that Tomoko Thats not Tomoko
Not anymore
Yoichi
he can see them too, cant he
Ryuji nods his head, lowers it sadly
Its all my fault
First Tomoko died, then those three others
It should have stopped there, but it didnt
Because of me
wonder
Asakawa turns to Ryuji suddenly
How did the rumors about the video even start in the first place
This kind of thing
it doesnt start by one person telling a story
Its more like everyones fear just takes on a life of its own
Fear
Or maybe its not fear at all
Maybe its what we were secretly hoping for all along
The ship has docked, its  extended
Ryuji and Asakawa walk the length of the gangplank towards the shore
man named
is already waiting for them
He holds up a white in both hands
Mr
Hayatsu
Aah, welcome
You must be tired after your long trip
Please, this way
Mr
Hayatsu leads Asakawa and Ryuji to an awaiting minivan

Saturday
- Ryuji and Asakawa sit in the back
Mr
Hayatsu is behind the wheel, chattering away
Back in the old days, the Yamamuras used to head fishing boats out in Sashikiji, though they dont much anymore
You know, one of Shizukos cousins is still alive
Hes just an old man now
His son and his daughter-in-law run an old-fashioned inn
went ahead and booked reservations for yall, hope thats alright
Asakawa gives the briefest of nods in reply, after which the minivan lapses into silence
Asakawa looks dreamily out at the mountain-studded landscape, then suddenly snaps to
(to Ryuji) Why did Yamamura Shizuko commit suicide
She was taking a real beating in the press, being called a fraud and all sorts of names
After a while she just lost it
to a scene of the minivan speeding along a country road
Shizuko was getting a lot of attention around the island after predicting the eruption of Mt
Mihara
Seems that for some time shed had a rather unique ability: precognition
It was around then that she attracted the attention of a certain scholar whom you may have heard of; Ikuma Heihachiro
He was driven out of the university, wasnt he
Ryuji nods
This Professor Ikuma convinces Shizuko to go to Tokyo with him, where he uses her in a series of demonstrations meant to prove the existence of
At first shes the darling of the press, but the next thing you know theyre knocking her down, calling her a fraud
Hmph
Forty years later, the media still hasnt changed that much
Asakawa continues, ignoring Ryujis barb
Ive heard this story
But
Im sure  remember hearing that somebody died at one of those demonstrations
strange look crosses Ryujis face
He looks away, ignores her for a moment
After getting kicked out of university, Ikuma just vanished, and no ones been able to get hold of him since
Hes probably not even alive anymore
But, why even try looking for him
Because hes supposed to have had a child with Shizuko
daughter
Asakawa freezes
In her mind, she sees a small  dressed in white, its face hidden by long, black
It is the figure from the video
- Mr
Hayatsu leads Asakawa and Ryuji to the entrance
Hello
The , a middle-aged lady named  wearing a traditional , comes shuffling up
She addresses Mr
Hayatsu
Thank you
She turns to Asakawa and Ryuji
(contd) Welcome
Well, Ill be off then
He gives a little bow and is off
Kazue, meanwhile, has produced two pairs of , which she offers to Ryuji and Asakawa
Please
Ryuji and Asakawa begin removing their shoes
- Kazue leads Ryuji and Asakawa up a shadowed, wooden
And for your rooms, how shall we
Separate, please
Sir
- 2ND Kazue gives a little bow
This way
Kazue turns to the right
Almost immediately after reaching the top of the steps, however, a strange look crosses Ryujis face
He heads down the opposite end of the corridor, Asakawa close behind
(alarmed) Sir
Ryuji flings open the   to one of the older rooms
There, hanging from one of the walls, is the oval-shaped  from the video, the one used by the mysterious lady to brush her long hair
Ryuji stares at the mirror, almost wincing
He turns around as if to look at Asakawa,but continues turning, looks past her
Asakawa follows his gaze, as does Kazue
Standing at the end of the corridor is an old man,
Yamamura regards them silently, balefully
Breaking the silence, Kazue gestures for Asakawa and Ryuji to follow
(softly) Please, this way
Asakawa races past the innkeeper towards the old man
He keeps his back turned towards her
Please
If you could just answer a few questions, about Shizuko
got nuthin to say
Its about Shizukos daughter
The old man says nothing
She did have a daughter, didnt she
Yamamura regards her for a moment, then turns to walk away
Youre wasting your time
- The  is laid out with an elaborate-looking
Asakawa sits alone, knees curled up to her chin, eyes wide and frightened
She is whimpering softly to herself
Just then, the  slides open and Ryuji walks in
He sits at the table and picks up a pair of
Arent you gonna eat
Umm
Hm
Youll stay with me wont you
When its time for me to die
Oh, stop it
Asakawa scoots across the tatami mats towards the table, grabs Ryuji fiercely by the arm
Youll stay, wont you
If you stayed, maybe youd learn something that could help Yoichi-- said stop it
Have you forgotten There was a girl with Tomoko when she died
That girls now in a mental institution
Who knows what could happen
But you could stay with me, Ryuji
Youd be
(angrily) Why, because Im already not right in the head
Asakawa releases her hold on Ryujis arm, lowers her head
Ryuji slams his chopsticks down angrily
If thats the case, why not just let things run its course, get rid of father -and- son
Yoichi was a mistake, anyway
Stop it
Short silence
When Ryuji speaks up again, his voice is soft, reassuring
We still have two days left
Just then the  of the innkeeper calls tentatively out from the other side of the sliding door
(
) Excuse me
Come in
Kazue slides the door open
She stands hesitantly in the doorway, something tucked under one arm
Its about Miss Shizuko
Ryuji shoots a glance at Asakawa and stands up from the table, walks towards the innkeeper
This is all that there is
Kazue produces an old black and white
The photo shows a , seated, dressed in a
in a Western-style stands beside her
Is this Professor Ikuma
Hearing this Asakawa leaps up, walks over to examine the picture for herself
yes
This picture is from before Id entered the household
She pauses a moment
(contd) should go now
The innkeeper scuttles off, leaving Asakawa and Ryuji alone with the photograph
Unbidden, the  from the video enters their thoughts

Caption-- September 19th
Monday
Ryuji strolls up to find old man Yamamura sitting alone, staring out at the sea
Yamamura glances up to see Ryuji approaching
Ryuji takes a seat next to the old man, but its Yamamura who speaks first
The deep basso of his voice emphasizes the drawl of his accent
Yalld do best to be off soon
Seas probably gonna be rough tonight
What kind of a child was Shizuko
Shizuko was
different
Shed come out here by herself everday an just stare out at the ocean
The fishermen all took a dislikin to her
Oceans an unlucky place for us, ysee: every year it swallows up more of our own
You keep starin out at somethin ike that
Shoumon bakkari shiteru to, boukon ga kuru zo
If you keep playing in the water, the monster will come for you
Yamamura looks at Ryuji, surprised
Shizuko could see inside people, couldnt she
Down to the places theyd most like to keep hidden
It must have been difficult for her
Yamamura rises unsteadily to his feet, features twisted angrily
Please leave
Now
Ryuji stands, takes hold of Yamamuras arm
Ive got a little of that ability myself
It was you who spread the word about Shizuko, wasnt it
And you who first contacted Professor Ikuma
Whatre you--
You thought youd be able to make some money off her
You even got some, from one of the newspapers
Leave me the hell alone
Mr
Yamamura strides angrily off
Both Ryuji and Asakawa take pursuit, Ryuji calling out from behind Yamamuras back
Tell us about Shizukos daughter
Who was she
dont know
She was there, with Shizuko
She had to be
Yamamuras pace, which has become increasingly erratic, finally causes him to stumble and fall
Ryuji comes up behind him, grasping him firmly
At their touch Ryujis power awakens, and as he peers into the old mans mind there is a sudden blinding The setting is a large
number of people are seated in folding chairs before a , on which are a four  in and a  in a
hangs above the stage, which reads
Ryuji eyes widen as he realizes he is seeing Shizukos demonstration before the press
He also realizes-- (to Yamamura) You were there
, the woman in the kimono, is sitting at a onstage
Her face is calm and expressionless
Standing off to one side and peering from behind the curtains is a young Mr
Yamamura
(
) You stood there and watched the demonstration
back to the beach
Asakawa comes running up toward Ryuji and the prone Mr
Yamamura
Suddenly there is another Asakawa, her eyes wide, finds herself inside the scene, reliving it as if she had actually been there
She watches as Shizuko receives a sealed clay  in both hands
Shizuko regards the pot a moment and then places it gently on the table before her
She takes a calligraphy  from the table, begins writing on a thin, rectangular sheet of
The members of the press talk excitedly, craning their necks for a better look
Onstage, a  holds up the phrase written by Shizuko and the folded sheet of paper taken from the sealed pot
The phrase on both sheets is identical
Match
Cameras begin  excitedly
Shizukos features melt into a soft smile
The experiment is performed again, and again the phrase written by Shizuko corresponds to the sealed sheet of paper
Match
Again and again, Shizuko unerringly demonstrates her power to see the unseen
Finally, a bearded  explodes from his chair, begins striding angrily towards the stage
Faker
This is nothing but trickery, and the lowest form of trickery at that
The reporter stops at the foot of the stage, points his finger accusingly at Shizuko
What are you trying to pull, woman
sitting in the front row also rises to his feet
#2 Thats right
Professor Ikuma, youre being fooled
By now most of the press has risen from their chairs, pointing and shouting angrily
Onstage, Shizuko backs away, eyes wide and frightened
She covers both ears, trying to block out the increasing din
Professor Ikuma holds her protectively by the shoulders
The first reporter is still shouting angrily, his voice rising above the others
Suddenly, a pained look crosses his face and he collapses to the floor
The crowd, and Asakawa as well, see that the reporters face is contorted into a grotesque mask of fear
#3 Whats happened
#4 Hes dead
#5 (to Shizuko) Witch
Professor Ikuma begins leading Shizuko offstage
They stop as someone unseen steps up, blocking their passage
Shizukos eyes widen, her head shaking in disbelief
Sadako
Was it you
to Ryuji on the beach
He looks up excitedly
Sadako
He recalls the image from the video, the alien eye with the single character  reflected in reverse
* >* The majority of girls' names in Japanese end in either -mi ("beauty") >or -ko ("child")
Thus, Sadako means "Chaste child
"  Sadako is, of >course, the mysterious daughter of Shizuko and Professor Ikuma
Sadako killed him
She can kill just with a thought
Shes
a devil spawn
back to the demonstration hall
Sadako, her face completely hidden by her long hair, runs offstage
and heads directly for Asakawa
Asakawa instinctively raises her arm, and Sadako grasps it fiercely
All the nails on Sadako hand are stripped away; her fingers are raw, bloody stumps
back to the beach
Asakawa, still caught in the throes of the vision, has begun to swoon
Finally her legs give out and she crumples to the beach
Ryuji grabs hold of her supportively
He glances down at her wrist, sees an ugly, purple  already beginning to form
The bruise is in the shape of five long, spindly fingers
Mr
Yamamura slowly rises to a sitting position, and together the three watch the approach of ominous, dark
Asakawa is on the phone, her voice almost frantic
Thats right
After Yamamura Shizuko committed suicide, Professor Ikuma took the daughter and ran
No, no one knows where they went
Thats why need -you- to find out where they are
Even if the professors dead, Sadako should still be in her forties
Ill explain it all later, but right now just hurry
Asakawa slams the phone down
to show Ryuji slumped in one corner of the room, his back to the wall
Sadakos probably already dead
She could kill people with just a thought, remember
Her mother wasnt even close to that
(flustered) Well, what about that video
If Sadakos dead then who made it
Nobody made it
It wasnt made at all
That video
is the pure, physical manifestation of Sadakos hatred
Ryuji turns to regard Asakawa, his eyes blank
Weve been cursed
There is a moment of silence before Mr
Hayatsu slides the door open, almost falling into the room
He is out of breath, and speaks rapidly
Its no good
With the typhoon coming in, all ships are temporarily staying docked
What about the fishing boats
Tell their captains Ill pay
Fishing boats
Sir, without knowing whether this typhoon is going to hit us or not,  think itd be better to wait and see how things turn-- Ryuji interrupts him, slamming both palms on the table
Glasses rattle wildly
Fine
Ill try searching myself
Ryuji stands and races past Mr
Hayatsu out into the rain
Hayatsu takes pursuit, calling after him
Mr
Takayama
Mr
Takayama
Asakawa, left alone, stares down at the tatami mats
- White-capped waves roll angrily in a black sea
Asakawa sits at a table, alone, her hands clasped as if in prayer
Her eyes are wide and glassy
The phone  suddenly and Asakawa dives for it, wrenching it from the cradle before it can ring a second time
Hello
(
) Mrs
Asakawa
Im sorry
tried, but  couldnt come up with any leads at all
look of abject fear crosses Asakawas face
She begins retreating into herself
(
) Hello
(softly) Thank you
Asakawa slowly places the phone back in its cradle
Almost immediately, her face begins to crumple
She falls to her knees, sobbing into the floor
Yoichi
She cries a while longer but suddenly stops
Her face, eyes streaked with tears, shoots suddenly up, stares directly at the telephone
(softly) Izu
Asakawa stands looking down on the wharf, scanning
Several   are docked
The wind whips her hair crazily around
She continues scanning, and suddenly she spies-- (calling) Ryuji
Asakawa runs down onto the wharf, heading towards Ryuji
He is in mid-conversation with Mr
Hayatsu
Ryuji
The phone in my apartment never rang
It only ever rang at the rental cottage
Professor Ikuma mustve
And weve got no way of going back
Its too dangerous
The thought of anybody going out in this weather
The three fall into silence as they realize the powerlessness of their situation
Suddenly, a deep  booms from behind them
(
) Ill take you out
The three spin around to see Mr
Yamamura, his  flapping in the gusty night air
He begins walking towards them
Sadako is callin yall, reckon
Mayhap to drag you down under the water
Short silence
Ryuji shoots a short questioning glance at Asakawa, turns back to face Mr
Yamamura
Please
Take us out
tiny   is tossed about on the waves
Mr
Yamamura stands at the wheel, his face expressionless
Ryuji and Asakawa are crouched close together in the cabin
Asakawas expression is dreamy, faraway
Its funny
Im not afraid at all
Ryuji leans over, rubs her hand comfortingly
Suddenly he switches back into analytical mode
Sadako probably died back out there at Izu, before the rental cottages were ever built
So, Sadako was Professor Ikumas daughter
(nodding) Ikuma smuggled her out in secret
His relationship with Shizuko was already a scandal, and one of the reasons he got drummed out of the university
Weve gotta find Sadakos body
(excitedly) Is that going to break the curse
Will Yoichi be all right
Its all weve got left to try
Just one more day
Ryuji puts his arm around Asakawa
- Ryuji stands on deck, looking out over the water
He heads down below toward the captains area
Mr
Yamamura is at the wheel
We made it
Maybe Sadako doesnt have it out for us after all
Long pause as Mr
Yamamura says nothing
Shizuko
she used to -speak- to the ocean, just ramble away
One time  hid, listenin to one of her conversations
Mr
Yamamura pauses again
(contd) And it werent in no human language
Asakawa has climbed out on deck and is looking up towards the sunrise

Monday
Ryuji races out of the store, loaded down with supplies
He holds a pair of  in one hand and a  and  in the other length of  is coiled over his left shoulder
He runs towards a , passing by Asakawa who stands at a , receiver in hand
(
) Hello
Yoichi
Its mommy
just called to say Ill be coming home tomorrow
Ryuji shoots a look at her over his shoulder
(
) Im tired of it here, mom
wanna go back to school
(smiling) Yoichi, its rude to your grandpa to talk like that
(
) Hes laughing
You wanna talk to him
No, thats
Asakawa pauses, her voice hitching
She seems about to lose her composure
Im sorry, Yoichi
Ill
Ill see you tomorrow
(
) Whats wrong
Asakawas face scrunches up in an effort to hold back tears
Mommys got something she has to do
Say hello to grandpa for me,
Ryuji stands by the car, scowling over at Asakawa
He shuts the just short of a slam
to Asakawa hanging up the phone
She half- runs towards the rental car and enters the passenger side, staring blankly into space
Ryuji slides into the drivers seat, buckles his What time was it when you first watched the video
Asakawa glances at her watch
Seven or eight minutes past seven
No more than ten minutes past
If the rumors are true, that time is gonna be our deadline
Asakawa buckles up as Ryuji steps on the gas
Asakawa sits in the passenger side
Her face is almost angelic, with the faintest hint of a smile
Ryuji shoots a questioning look at her
The white rental car tears past the  reading Izu Pacific Land
The car continues into the , screeching around corners before coming to an abrupt halt
Asakawa, her face still oddly expressionless, gets out of the passenger side
Ryuji exits as well, the hint of a shudder running through him as he regards the series of rental cabins
-Here-
to Asakawa and Ryuji walking up the gravel  towards the rental cabins
Ryuji looks back over his shoulder as both he and Asakawa stop before cabin B4
The cabin is on , its underbelly fenced off by wooden
Ryuji drops most of his supplies to the ground, but keeps hold of the
He raises the pick over one shoulder and begins smashing away at the latticework
When he has cleared enough space for passage, he begins picking up supplies and tossing them hastily within
When finished, he holds a hand out for Asakawa
The two enter the earthen basement
B4 - Ryuji pulls a  out, flicks it on
The  arcs outwards, illuminating what looks more like an old mine shaft than a modern rental cottage
The beam halts when it suddenly encounters an old The well is badly chipped on one side, and sealed off with a solid-looking stone
Ryuji rushes quickly towards it
knew it
The well
He squats down beside the well, setting the flashlight on the lid
Asakawa sinks slowly down beside him
The well
Ryuji reaches out and takes Asakawas hand
He sets their enclasped hands onto the lid, and together they begin lightly tracing the surface of the lid with their free hands
Asakawa closes her eyes in concentration
and suddenly, as with the incident on the beach, Asakawa finds herself drawn into Ryujis psychometric
The picture is black and white, grainy like old film
in a   walks slowly towards an open well
She places her hand on the  of the well, peers curiously down
Asakawa looks up, her eyes wide open
There is now a second person in the vision, an   in an old- fashioned tweed  standing behind the young girl
He suddenly produces some  , and strikes the girl savagely across the back of the head
The girl falls forward
The man drops to the ground, grabbing the girl behind the knees and hoisting her limp  over the lip and into the well
The body falls into its depths
Panting heavily, the man leans forward and grasps the lip of the well with both hands, looking down
He flashes a guilty look in either direction, checking that his crime has gone unnoticed, and as he does so Asakawa realizes that she knows this face
The image from the videotape, like a face in the moon: it had been Sadako inside the well, looking up to see this man staring back down at her
This man whose name is Professor Ikuma Heihachiro
Her own father
The energy seems to drain out of Asakawa in a rush, and her body crumbles
Ryuji catches hold of her
It was Ikuma who put this lid on
And Sadakos still inside
Ryuji stands quickly, takes hold of the crowbar
He inserts it under the lid and begins trying to pry it off, face scrunched with effort
Asakawa digs her fingers in and lends her own strength as well
Slowly, the lid begins to move
Ryuji tosses the crowbar aside and the two lean the combined weight of their bodies into it
The lid slides off, dropping to the earth with a dull
Ryuji sits to one side, winded with effort, as Asakawa takes hold of the flashlight
She shines it down into the well, but it only seems to intensify the gloom
What she can see looks fetid and brackish
Ryuji sees her expression and begins removing his
Ill go
He walks off, leaving Asakawa alone
to an overhead shot of the well
is fastened to one side, and Ryuji has already begun lowering himself down
His eyes wander overthe grime-smeared , and with a shudder he begins to pick out human
Torn loose and spattered with blood, countless fingernails line the sides of the well
Sadako was alive
Shed tried to climb her way out
Ryujis face twists into a grimace as if momentarily experiencing Sadakosterrible agony
He waits a moment longer before edging his way down the rope again, finally  to rest at the bottom of the well
He holds his flashlight above the brackish water, calls up to Asakawa
Lower the buckets
Asakawa nods and lowers two plastic  fastened to a rope
Ryuji grabs one and scoops up a bucketful of water, tugging on the rope when finished
Take it up
Asakawa hoists the bucket up to the rim of the well
She walks a small distance and tosses the contents out onto the ground
She happens to glance through the wooden lattice to the outside, and with a start realizes that the sun has already started to set
nervous glance at her  later and she is back at the well, lowering the empty bucket to find another full one already awaiting her
Take it up
In the well, Ryuji glances at his watch
He looks at it for a long moment, the expression on his face saying Were not going to make it
Time passes as Asakawa pulls up bucketload after bucketload, her strength beginning to fade
She half-stumbles, glances up
and is shocked to realize that  has fallen
to Asakawa slowly pulling up yet another bucket, her strength almost gone
She looks at her watch and sees that it is now past 6:00
She calls frantically down to Ryuji
Its already six
(explosively) know
Hurry up and
The bucket slowly jerks into motion
Asakawa pulls it up to the rim of the well, holds it unsteadily
She takes one faltering step and falls, spilling the buckets contents onto the ground
to Ryuji in the well, standing ready with another bucketful
Take it up
Nothing happens
Asakawa
The bucket begins moving, even slower than before
to Asakawa, her body trembling with effort
By now its all she can do to simply keep her body moving
She glances behind her, sees through the wooden lattice that it is now pitch black
look of resignation crosses her face and she releases her hold on the bucket, her body crumpling and falling in on itself
to the bucket splashing back into the well, narrowly missing Ryuji
(fuming) What the hell are you doing
Trying to get me killed
back to Asakawa, her face dead
Ryuji calls out from the well
(
) Hey
Asakawa falls backward onto the ground, arms splayed
to the rim of the well
Ryuji pulls himself up over the rim, catches sight of Asakawa
Asakawa
She lifts her head up but says nothing as Ryuji walks over to her
Well change
Youre in no condition to keep this up
Asakawa suddenly springs into life
Her voice is frantic, fearful
: No
Who do you expect to pull up these buckets, then
But, we dont even know if its doing any good
Ryuji strides forward and slaps Asakawa painfully across the cheek
He begins shaking her roughly for good measure
And what about Yoichi, huh
Is his mother not coming to pick him up after all
He releases his hold on her
The two stare at each other a long time, saying nothing
to an overhead shot of Asakawa being lowered into the well now to Asakawa inside the well, her face and clothes covered with grime, body simultaneously limp with exhaustion and tense with fright
Unable to resist the impulse, Asakawa slowly looks over her shoulder and down into the well
The dankness, the claustrophobia seeps in and she draws in her breath in the first signs of panic
Dont look down
She returns her gaze, cranes her neck upward
to Ryuji leaning over the rim of the well, peering down at her
For an instant, everything becomes monochrome
Its not Ryuji looking down at her at all; its Professor Ikuma, checking to see if shes still alive or if the blow to the back of her head has finished her off
to Asakawa, her eyes wide with fright
Asakawa comes to rest at the bottom of the well
hangs from another rope, but its beam has almost no effect on the darkness
Asakawa crouches forward, hands moving searchingly through the water
She calls out pleadingly
Where are you
Please, come out
Asakawa straightens, unties herself from the rope
full bucket already awaits
She tugs on the rope and Ryuji pulls it up
She scoops up a second bucket, but something stops her from sending it up
Instead, she begins running her arms through the water again, her voice close to tears
Please
Where are you
Asakawa continues her blind fumbling, which sends up little splashes of stagnant water
With a start, she realizes that her fingers have caught something
Seaweed
Asakawa draws her hands close for a better look
and sees that is
thick clump of long, black hair
Suddenly a pale, thin  shoots out from beneath the water, catching Asakawa just below the wrist
Asakawas ears are filled with a like moaning as something slowly rises from its watery slumber
It is a , her face completely hidden by long, black hair
to a shot of Asakawas face
Far from being frightened, her features are oddly placid
She regards the fearsome thing before her with an almost tender look
Asakawa reaches out, lightly strokes that long hair
Its you
She strokes the hair again, and abruptly it peels right off the head with a loud
Revealed is not a face at all but a
Its sockets are at first menacingly empty, but then begin to ooze the green  it has pulled up from the bottom of the well
Like a mother comforting a frightened child, Asakawa pulls the skeletal remains to her breast, strokes the bony head comfortingly
Her eyes begin to glaze
to Ryuji racing up to the rim of the well, leaning down intently
Hey
Asakawa
Its already 10 minutes past seven
We did it
Down in the well, Asakawa continues staring blankly ahead
Her body suddenly falls forward, limp
B4 Three   are parked outside the rental cottages, crimson headlights flashing
few  walk by, two of them carrying something off in white
to Ryuji and Asakawa sitting on the curb
Asakawa is staring off at something, a draped over her shoulder
Why would Ikuma have killed her
His own daughter
Maybe she wasnt his daughter at all
What
Maybe her father
wasnt even human
The two exchange glances
Ryujis gaze falls to Asakawas , which he suddenly takes and holds close to his face
The ugly bruise where Sadako had grabbed her has disappeared
Its gone
He shakes his head, clearing his analytical mind of their ordeal
Enough, already
Its over
Cmon
Ill take you home
Ryuji stands, pulls Asakawa to her feet
- Ryujis white  pulls up into the parking lot
He and Asakawa get out, regard each other from opposite sides of the car
There is a long moment where neither of them says anything
Get some rest
He flashes her the slightest of grins
(contd) still have a thesis to finish
to a shot of Ryuji and Asakawa, the car creating an almost metaphoric distance between them
thank you
Ryuji nods silently by way of reply
He gets into his car and drives off
Asakawa watches him go, and then walks towards the entrance of her apartment
Asakawa walks into her room, sits on the edge of her bed
It is now morning, and she sits dazedly watching the sun come up
Ryuji sits busily scribbling into a
He stops writing a moment to regard his notes while taking a sip of
He glances over at his  for confirmation when a small scowl crosses his brow
Its gone a moment later as he chuckles wryly to himself
That girl
Ryuji stands, walks over to the blackboard
He fixes Mais little prank with a single chalk stroke
Asakawa emerges, taking in the dawn
At first her face is calm and tranquil
but her features change as the sun almost noticeably darkens and a  begins to kick up her hair
She now looks very anxious

: This next scene is entirely visual
If you are reading this translation before watching the movie, do yourself a favor; reading this now and watch the scene for itself
Ryuji is busy scribbling away at his notes again
His hand suddenly ceases, eyes dancing worriedly as he hears a faint
No
Breath rattling fearfully in his throat, Ryuji spins around to face the
He gets out of his seat for a better look, falling to his knees on the tatami
The image that fills the screen is the last scene from the videotape; the shot of the well
The  from before comes louder now, more insistent, a metallic screeching that both repulses and beckons him closer
Ryuji crawls on all fours towards the , stares at its unchanging image with terrible foreboding
There is a flash of  as something shoots out of the well hand
First one, and then another, as Sadako, still in her grimy white dress, face hidden beneath long, oily strands of hair, begins slowly pulling herself out
The television screen jumps unsteadily, fills with static as if barely able to contain her image
back and forth between Ryuji, who is beginning to visibly panic, and the television, which shows Sadako lurching ever closer
(almost frantic) Why
The  rings, and Ryuji spins round towards it, breath catching in his throat
He looks at the phone, over his shoulder at the television, back to the phone
Thats it
Asakawa
Ryuji scrambles wildly towards the phone
He takes the receiver but is unable to do more than clutch it fearfully as his gaze is drawn inexorably back to the television
Sadakos shrouded face has filled the entire screen
and then, television popping and crackling, she jerks forward and emerges from the television onto the floor of Ryujis apartment
Ryuji backs away, screaming in terror
Aaargh
Sadako lies prone, collapsed, hair splayed out like a drowned corpse
Only her  are active, crawling, feeling
The  of her fingers are little more than bloodied stumps, not a single fingernail on them
She uses the strength in those fingers to pull herself forward, coming jerkily to her feet
The joints of her body twist unnaturally, more insect-like than human
Ryuji flings the phone aside and begins scrambling about the apartment as if looking for cover
The strength has already begun to fade from his body, however, and his movements are clumsy, exaggerated
He falls to the floor, panting heavily
Sadako turns to regard him, and for just an instant we can see beneath her impenetrable shroud of hair; a single  burns with manic, unbridled hatred
Its gaze meets Ryujis, and his face twists into a grimace as he loudly
- Yoichi sits on the lawn, doodling into a large
He suddenly stops, eyes registering that he has somehow felt his fathers death
Asakawa clutches the  to her ear
She can still hear the sounds of metallic  coming from the video, though they are now becoming softer
Asakawa comes running down a side street, turning the corner and making for the entrance to Ryujis apartment building
There is a single  posted at the entrance
He reaches out, catches Asakawa lightly by the arm
Are you a resident here, maam
Im Takayama Ryujis wife
The guard drops his hand, and Asakawa makes for the entrance
Im sorry maam, but theyve already taken the body away
Asakawas spins around, eyes wide
Body
Mai is there, slumped against one wall
Asakawa comes running up, dropping to her knees and grasping Mai by the shoulders
What happened
Mai shakes her head dreamily
When  got here he was just lying there
Did he say anything to you
About a videotape
Mai shakes her head again, shakes it harder until the breath catches in her throat
His face
Mai falls into silence, curls up on herself
Asakawa leaves her and crosses toward the door to Ryujis apartment
- The front  opens wildly, noisily forward
Asakawa comes rushing in, eyes darting about the apartment
She thinks frantically to herself
() Ryuji
why
Does this mean that Yoichi will die, too
Is the curse not broken yet
Her gaze falls to the television set
She dives forward, presses the eject button on the
Sure enough, the  is still in the deck
She takes the tape and leaves
- Asakawa walks slowly, dreamily forward
She drops the videotape loudly onto the coffee table and slouches into a
Her eyes fall to the framed photographs of Yoichi on one of the shelves
This snaps Asakawa out of her daze and she begins whispering intently to herself, thinking
was the only one to break Sadakos curse
Ryuji
why
Something  did that you didnt
Something  did that you didnt
Asakawa gives up, lowers her face into her hands
When she looks up again, she happens to glance at the television screen-- and its  reveals that there is someone  in the room with her
It is the figure from the videotape, the silent accuser with the cloth draped over its face
With a start, Asakawa realizes that the figure is wearing Ryujis clothes
Ryuji
She spins around, but the room is empty
Asakawas mind races
The figure had been pointing towards her
She stands, rummages in her bag to produce her copy of the cursed videotape
She takes Ryujis  in her other hand, her eyes darting between the two tapes
Something  did that you didnt
It suddenly clicks home as Asakawa looks full-on at Ryujis version of the tape, plainly marked
What broke the curse was that  copied the tape and showed it to someone else
to Asakawa slowly pulling her  from the television stand
look of almost frightening resolve etches her face
of Asakawas car
We hear her  on the cell phone
(
) Dad
Its me
Im on my way over
Look, dad, Ive got something to ask
Its for Yoichi
on the  in the passenger side
to Asakawa at the wheel as time spirals forward, the decisions of the present already become rumor of the future
() They say theres a way you can stay alive after you watch the video
Youve gotta make a copy of it, and show it to somebody else inside a week
() But what about the person you show it to
() Well, then they make a copy and show it to somebody else
Again, inside a week
() (laughing) Then theres no end to it
() Thats just it
There -is- no end
But if it meant not dying
youd do it, wouldnt you
Asakawas eyes begin to well
Her car speeds along the highway, to the direction of menacing-looking
