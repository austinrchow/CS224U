Bloodshot blue
Her eyelashes tremble
tear rolls out
She blinks
-  filthy, coarse rope secures a dirty rag inside her mouth
- The same type rope binds her ankles together
-  mixture of blood, dirt - The Young Woman, 20s, wearing a handmade dress with a small crest embroidered over the heart, lies nailed to a wooden table

The Young Woman's breathing intensifies
She watches the light bulb, listens to the screams

The screams stop
Peace for a moment
But she knows that won't last

He's bloodied, bruised

They , sending  into the air
Brought together by
All that's visible are his hands
His left hand is  , , while his right appears normal
He touches the jumper cables together again
Please-please stop

The Concealed Figure ignores his pleas, connects the left cable to one shackle chain

Blood oozes out

She sits up, goes for the gag, but her fingers cramp in pain
Finally, she unties the knot, removes the gag
She coughs, tries to muffle the noise best she can
The
Lights return to normal
Half way free
She goes for the ropes at her ankles, unties them, slides off the table
She grabs a couple rags, ties them around her palm's wounds

/   #2                                   6 The Young Woman opens the door, checks to see if the coast is clear
It is
We're at the end of a long, dark hallway (more like a tunnel, really)
There are two more doors in the hall, one in front of her another to her right
The door across from her is slightly ajar
'    - The Young Man dangles from the chains
Suddenly, the Concealed Figure appears between the door and the Young Man
The Young Woman retreats, but realizes the Concealed Figure has his back to her

sees past the Figure,   with the Young Woman
No hope for himself, his eyes say: Save yourself
The Young Woman fights back tears, mouths the words " Love you"
She carefully opens the door to her right,  a rickety set of wooden steps
She heads up, just as

The Young Woman quickens her pace

In pursuit
: 12
-                                            12 races through the thick forest
Her bare, bloody feet and legs stomping over the hard dirt, branches, shrubs, anything in her way
Not too far behind
(the majority of him still hidden) follows her

pushes through some thick brush, but
trips, falls
She   , grabs her foot, notices Sarah turns, hears
approaches in the distance
wills herself up, limp/runs away

'  -   and a small  at the bottom, 200 feet below
flows steadily nearby
Before Sarah can fully digest the situation
exits the forest,    in his hand
Anticipating its use
Sarah  in her spot
Breaths get shorter, heavier
Her eyes dart in every direction
What to do
The Concealed Figure     and Rather that fate than the other
The Concealed Figure walks up to the edge, looks over
Sarah's dead body lays twisted and bloody among the rocks
The waterfall crashes next to her mixes with the water turning it a deep

() -                                   15 , late 20s, with a devilish grin and looks to kill, sits at the wheel
Even a flashy pair of sunglasses can't mask the twinkle in his eye
, late 20s, rides shotgun
This beauty's got it all: toned bod, sharp mind and a heart-stopping smile
An opened bag of chips sit in her lap
couple of Diet Cokes in the cup-holders
She cradles a cellphone MP3 player
5
Come on, hit me
(Flipping through tunes) Chill
gotta find -- alright
You got one
Sheryl hits the "Play" button
"Warning Shots", Thievery Corporation
Mike grins
Sheryl rolls her eyes
Come on
Next one
Sheryl scrolls again, hits play
"Bullets" by the Editors
Sheryl frowns
Mike grins and shoots her a wink
You loaded these songs
You don't need to be so impressed with yourself
know  don't have to be
haven't even heard of half these bands
It's called good music
You should try to familiarize yourself with it, instead of listening to the crap you do
listen to crap
Hurts me to be the one to tell you
'm sure it does
6
You gotta be more like me, baby
Think new, fresh, cutting edge
'm looking for the next Beatles, U2 or Radiohead
Sheryl scans through the MP3 player, spots one and smiles
So, where does this band fall into that group
The music starts
' ' , "     " blares
Fresh, new or cutting edge
Mike immediately begins to backtrack
How'd that get on there
You loaded the songs
You tell me
Must be a mistake
Says here you've listened to it 86 times
Busted
Is this true
Have you always wanted to be a cowboy
Sheryl spies more
You also got "Men Without Hats" greatest hits
didn't know they qualified for a greatest hits album
Can you break me off a little "Safety Dance"
Mike reaches for the MP3 player
Okay, give me that
The Passat speeds past a "West Virginia" state sign

The Passat turns into the park

,   -                       17 The Passat rolls into a dirt parking lot
Next to the lot is the Ranger Station

-                               18 Maps and local artifacts adorn the walls
display of some of the local animals, stuffed of course, including a giant bear, fill in the gaps
Mike and Sheryl enter
They take in the place
Mike heads toward the Ranger's desk while Sheryl eyes the decor
, 65, a round-faced  with a grumpy disposition, a hearing aid in his right ear, sits behind a desk
He continues working, scribbling on something as Sheryl and Mike wait
And wait
Then
Good morning
Sam holds up a "wait a second" finger
After a beat
Now what can  do you two for
Sheryl spots some fliers tacked to a bulletin board
Hiking gear for sale, Tour Info, National Park History, etc
Well
ah
First time here and you're not quite sure where to begin
Sheryl grabs a National Park Information flier
- There are pictures, an Emergency Contact Information, Guided Tour Info, etc
Something like that
Precisely like that
Sam stands, grabs his lower back, a recurring discomfort
As he digs around for something
17, 2006          8
Sheryl notices, on the board
-  flier for a young missing couple
Below that
-  photo of a girl: "Sarah Travers"(from the opening scene)
Sheryl studies it and shakes off any concern by locking arms with Mike at the desk
Get you started with one of these
Sam grabs a map and lays it out in front of the couple
How long you folks hiking for
Two days
Heading out early Sunday
Well, if you move at a decent clip, you could hit the summit by midday tomorrow
Should still give you time to take it all in and make it down
Any particular path
You folks experienced hikers
We've done some ah-- (interrupting) No
Nothing like this
For first-timers,  recommend either Willow Creek Bridge or Donner Trail
Donner Trail
As in "The Donner Party
" 'm not sure of the name's origin
They're the two paths we regularly patrol
Something happens and you're on one of the other trails, it might be awhile before we find you
9
Where do we camp
Unless it says not to, you can set up where you like
Just make sure when you turn in that you extinguish your fire
Oh, and this here's bear country
They're not animals to fool with
You see one, you head the other way, especially if he's feeding
If the bear thinks you're getting in the way of his food, that's all she wrote
Sheryl warily eyes the stuffed Bear in the station
(Sarcastic) Great
You got yourself a first aid kit
Nurse Betty here's my first aid kit
Sam looks confused
Don't mind him
'm a nurse
Good for you
The question was, do you have a first aid kit
Yes, we have a first aid kit
Great, see how easy that was
(Moving on) It's off-season, park's pretty quiet
Even more than usual
You may run into a few locals, but-- People live up here
We have a few generations of families that have called these mountains home
Most of `em are friendly
Respect their land and they'll respect you
10
Mike twangs and air banjos, "Dueling Banjos" from `Deliverance
' Sam is not amused
Sheryl fights her temptation to laugh
Sorry
(Moving on) Base is just outside, to the left
At about two miles up there'll be a junction where you can pick your path
Thanks
Mike and Sheryl offer a smile and quickly exit

-                               19 Mike and Sheryl exit
They burst out laughing
: 20
,   -                       20 Mike digs through his backpack, double-checking everything
What he doesn't show Sheryl
wrapped in some socks: a
38 Revolver
He tucks it discreetly away
Sheryl checks her bag as well
She clips a blue hikers' towel to her waist
Mike checks his cell phone
No service
You getting anything
Sheryl checks her phone and shakes her head "no
" 'll lock them in the car
'll take mine
Why
Just to annoy you
Seriously
17, 2006         11
In an emergency, 'd rather have a phone that may not work up there, than not have a phone that may work up there
Huh
Mike shakes his head, puts his phone in the glove compartment
Sheryl tucks her phone and the flier into a side pocket of her backpack
Zips it shut
- Mike's keys and his Boston Red Sox key chain
Mike locks the door
Okay, we all set
(Excited) Yup
Let's do this
Mike pulls on his backpack, starts walking
Sheryl doesn't move
She eyes their tent still resting on the car's roof
Hey, Einstein
What do you think, leave the tent or maybe take it with us
Mike swallows his pride and retreats to the car
was just seeing if you were paying attention
Mike comes back to the car for the tent
Sheryl shakes her head and smiles

#1 -                                    21 The mountain is breathtaking
Nature at its best
Mike and Sheryl have begun their ascent
It could be fun
Not a chance
High School reunions serve only two purposes
to try to () 12
(cont'd) rehash so-called glory days if you were popular or to gloat if you were a spaz and are now filthy rich, banging a super-model
So what were you
Me
was a stoner
So what does that mean
How the hell am  supposed to remember
was high all the time
Sheryl swallows some water, checks her compass
Sweat rolls down Mike's forehead, stinging his eyes
Sheryl doesn't have that problem
She's wearing a red bandana
Where'd you get that bandana
It's cute, right
stopped by that Army-Navy store on Grover yesterday
Keeps the sweat out of your eyes
And when you were buying it, you didn't think that maybe
Oh
well
it was the last one
The last one
Yeah
The entire Army-Navy store
sold out
Completely
There was some sort of run on bandanas at the last minute
Sheryl stifles a
Mike shakes his head, then
she pulls out a  , hands it to him
17, 2006   13
Here
You big baby
Sheryl turns, as she does
Mike pinches her behind, she playfully , hustles away from him, but he pursues her, as they both  , they spill off the trail
Mike and Sheryl continue their horseplay, when
,
,
The Steel jaws of the trap have sliced the body in two
The kill looks fresh
Fucking nasty
What is it
Looks like it's a, or was, a fox
Come on
Mike and Sheryl head back to the path
- The ,
21A
-                          21A Mike and Sheryl hike over a small wooden bridge
22
#2 -                                   22 Mike and Sheryl reach a small clearing
There are a number of signs pointing toward different trails
(Donner Trail, Willow Creek Bridge, Timber Falls, etc
) Sheryl grabs the map and some water
Mike swigs some water, munches on trail mix, takes a peek in the guidebook
What do you think
"Cannibal" Trail or the other one
Guidebook says a couple of these other trails lead to some pretty sweet views
We're not Lewis and/or Clark
We're gonna stick to one of the ones the Ranger said
14
() You folks need some help
, 40s, approaches, wheeling some supplies in a handmade wagon
She is worn, haggard, but has a friendly, smile
She wears a flannel shirt, old jeans and dirty boots
We're just going over our options here
Well, take it from me, any way you choose, you can't go wrong
The Ranger at base suggested Donner Trail or
Willow Creek Bridge
think Sam only knows those two trails
Well
Between those, 'd pick Donner Trail
Willow Creek will shoot you to the top, but there's not as much to see
Donner weaves through Peddler's Point, it's a better hike and prettier all around view
(To Mike) What do you think
Then, she notices a ring on Sheryl's finger
That's a pretty ring
Thank you
Not your traditional wedding ring, but it's all the same in the Lord's eyes
How long have you two been wed
Sheryl and Mike trade looks
Oh
we're not married
Not yet anyway
Mike shoots her a look: "not yet
" 15
It's a ring my father gave me for graduation
(embarrassed) Oh, 'm sorry
You just looked like you was married is'all
Both so beautiful
(Beat) 'm just an old fashioned silly-bird
need to mind my own business
No, it's fine
(changing topics) Which one of those trails got the best clearings
Clearings
Neither will give you much in the way of clearings
But, there's another path, this one here
(Points to the map) Timber Falls
Its got some beautiful vistas and one of the prettiest falls you'll ever see
Sounds perfect
(To Sheryl) Yeah
Well, 'll leave you to it
Last thing you need is me fussing'round you, taking you from your private time
Thank you
Yeah, thanks for the tip
Ida walks off, but stops only a few feet away
'm just gonna say it and go, but if you two were to marry
bet the Lord would bless you with a happy, healthy and handsome child
Good luck and God bless you both
16
Sheryl and Mike don't know how to respond
Ida leaves
Once out of earshot
suddenly feel the need for confession
(Still lingering on
) Not yet
Love taking your shots, don't ya
Sheryl shoots him a stern, but playfully sexy, look
When  see an opening
(Checks map) That path she was talking about winds through these falls
What do you think
think
if you get eaten by a bear and there isn't a Ranger around, 'm not carrying what's left of you down this mountain
And they say romance is dead
(Smiling wide) Timber Falls it is
They throw on their backpacks and head on their way
Who's Lewis and/or Clark
You really were stoned through high school
As Mike and Sheryl trek up the path
- The directional sign, "Timber Falls" 23
#1 -                               23 Looking back down on the thin path
- Sheryl and Mike continuing their trek
( ) Mike maneuvers around a massive tree
He freezes
Gestures for Sheryl to be quiet and mouths the words, "Don't Move
" 17
Sheryl stops, startled
Mike motions towards
, with magnificent antlers, chews on a plant in the distance
Sheryl quietly slides out her digital camera
Snaps a photo of the animal
The Stag stops chewing and looks at them
After a long beat, the Stag skips away through the trees
Sheryl watches the animal disappear, smiles
Mike removes his backpack and crosses to Sheryl
He helps remove her backpack and kisses her
She kisses him back
- Sheryl's heart-shaped locket through her shirt
You're going to lose that out here
It's fine
never take it off
Not since you gave it to me
Betcha don't remember
February 27, 2006
Sheryl stares incredulously, romantically at Mike
Speechless
remember every moment with you
've got you so whipped
They kiss
Sheryl climbs onto Mike's lap
He leans back, better positioning, places his hand down, when
Mike brings his hand back up
trickles out of a across his palm
What
My hand
Something stuck it
18
Sheryl quickly examines the cut
Mike quickly becomes flustered, woozy
He turns away from the wound
It's okay
It's not too deep
Let me get the first aid kit
Sheryl rummages through her bag
Mike, in more psychological discomfort than physical, looks away wincing
Sheryl returns, wipes the blood away best she can
She applies some peroxide
Fuck
That stung
Gotta clean the wound, baby
24     -  --                                24 From a distance
enters frame, pulls a branch aside
Sheryl attends to Mike's wound
The  narrows

25    ,  #1--                                      25 Mike looks at Sheryl, a twinge of embarrassment in his eyes
You know me and blood
we don't do so well
know
(She finishes) All done
:  of something stepping on a thicket
Sheryl glances toward the sound
Mike admires the dressing of the wound
Not bad, Nightingale
Not bad at all
Did you hear something
Mike follows her eye-line
There's a softer
It's probably the deer
19
The deer went in the other direction
Mike's demeanor suddenly becomes cold, creepy
Maybe it's someone, or something, stalking us
Quit it
Something inhuman watching our every move
said, knock it off
Something coming for you, Sheryl
Sheryl straps on her backpack
Just when  think there's hope for you
What
You're an asshole
Sheryl walks away
This is a joke
You're not really mad, are you
Sheryl
She turns the corner and is out of sight
'm sorry
(Under his breath) Unbelievable
Mike's in disbelief
He grabs his backpack, heads after her
Sheryl
He turns the corner, looks up, but doesn't see her
The path winds like a snake
17, 2006        20
Sheryl, wait up
Mike moves up the winding path
He stops, eyes searching
Something's wrong
The path opens up
Mike can now see a hundred yards ahead, but
No sign of Sheryl
(Calls out) Sheryl
This isn't funny
Silence
Two birds  and fly from their perch overhead
Mike eyes the birds, then takes off
Mike's heart-rate increases
He moves quickly up the path, a steep incline
He brushes past a bush and stops
Lying just off the path
'  '
He picks it up
Sheryl
No reply
His heart now
Mike moving faster
Up ahead, he stops again, finds
'
Sheryl
Silence
Mike picks up the bandana
He's flying
He cuts through some tiny evergreens, off the path
26
,   #1 -                26 Mike freezes when he sees
Sheryl's backpack lies against a tree
few feet farther along, her cut-off jean shorts
Next to them
her shirt
But no Sheryl, until
() Good old Hansel
Following the trail of bread crumbs
Mike turns to see Sheryl lying against a rock, wearing just her bra and panties
She smiles at him coyly
Mike exhales deeply
Relieved, but fuming
You bitch
17, 2006          21
Doesn't feel good to be teased, does it
Okay, he had that coming
Truce
Truce
He takes her in
She's quite a sight
He sits down next to her
They kiss
Then
Mike breaks the embrace
Don't disappear on me again
Sheryl mouths the words, " promise
"    Crosses her heart
He leans in, they kiss again
Soft and sweet at first
Then it deepens
Sheryl rubs his chest and removes his shirt
They kiss again
Harder this time
Their hands all over one another
Mike slides his hand under Sheryl's panties, between her legs
She moans softly
Sheryl unhooks her bra and is about to remove it, when: (
) Hey, Brody, Lonnie
Check this out
, 30, a skinny local with a twisted smile and , 20's, a slob, emerge from the forest
They are followed by
, 35, scruffy and unshaven, their ringleader
Brody clutches a shotgun in one hand and a weathered sack in the other
Looks like we got ourselves a little party
Brody and Darryl ogle Sheryl
She tucks herself behind Mike, who shifts quickly into protective mode
She snaps her bra back closed
We were just moving our way up the mountain
22
You were moving your way'round more than just that
Sheryl eyes her discarded clothes
Darryl spots them too
He grabs the shorts,  them
(Referring to the smell) Like a peach
Mike tries to seem relaxed and friendly
You folks best be careful about what you do up here
Never know who's watching
Appreciate the advice
think we learned our lesson
Brody nods as he looks them up and down
You city folk, ain't ya
Up from Charleston roughing it, seeing how the "other" half lives
No, we're from Virginia, just up for a weekend trip
And, uh
you folks live up here
Brody glances at Darryl and Lonnie, then back at Mike
It's easy to spot the city folk
It's like they're trying to be friendly, when really they don't want to be
think you just startled us is all
Sheryl looks over at
Lonnie sticks his tongue between his fingers, rapidly flails it about
Uncomfortable silence
23
We'll just be on our way
(Re: Sheryl's shorts) May  have those
bold move from Mike
Finders keepers
Long beat
Tension high
Darryl
Brody concedes, gestures to Darryl to give the shorts back
Darryl reluctantly obliges
Mike passes them to Sheryl who slides them on
Darryl and Lonnie soak in every inch of Sheryl as she does
Mike takes Sheryl's hand
They make a move, but
Brody stops them with the barrel of his shotgun
Where you runnin' off to
Yeah, we just getting acquainted and shit
Mike glances down at the barrel that runs across his chest
He can no longer hide his fear
We just want to get a little further along before the sun sets
Darryl eyes the sky
The sun beams down through the trees
Plenty of time'fore that
Look
We don't want any trouble
We just want to be on our way
And why do you suppose we mean to make trouble
Mike looks down at the gun
Brody smiles a yellow smile
17, 2006     24
You folks enjoy the spirits
Excuse me
The what
Spirits
Booze
Sure
Yeah
Brody hands Darryl the shotgun and drops his sack
Brody pulls a mason jar with clear liquid out of the sack
Why don't you try a taste of this
Brody unscrews the cap and offers the jar to Mike
Mike eyes Sheryl
Clearly she doesn't think it's a good idea
Mike accepts the jar, hesitates, then takes a sip
He squirms, winces, but forces it down
Mike turns red and coughs
Brody and Darryl are loving it
Betcha never tasted nuthin'like that
Darryl would win that bet
Fifty bucks
Mike has no idea what he's talking about
'll sell you the jar for fifty bucks
(Ogles Sheryl) Or maybe we could do us a little trade
Let me get my wallet
Mike opens a zipper on his backpack, rummages around
-
the
38 Revolver
25
Mike thinks about grabbing it
Sheryl shocked to see the gun
She tenses up
- Brody
The shotgun
Mike thinks, then
Fifty bucks sounds like a bargain
(To Mike) Pay the man
Mike reaches past the gun and grabs his wallet
He counts out the cash, hands it to Brody
Brody smiles, hands the jar to Mike
Pleasure doing business with ya
Take care now
Brody nods at Mike and Sheryl, walks off down the trail
Darryl grins at Sheryl, follows Brody
Should you tire of your present company
just holla and 'll come running with bells on darling
He smiles a creepy wide smile
He turns and catches up to the others
Once they are out of sight
Mike takes a moment to gather himself
Sheryl grabs her shirt still on the ground, puts it on
Are you okay
You brought a gun
No response
Sheryl picks up her towel and bandana
Why did you bring a gun
Same reason you brought your cellphone
Better to have it and not need it
To protect us
Lotta good it just did
26
Sheryl turns from Mike, walks back to the path
(Then, call out) You want to go back
(No response) Sheryl
'm sorry
We should have stuck to one of the patrolled paths
Sheryl charges ahead, back to the path
(Under his breath) Fuck
Mike gets up, grabs his bag and follows Sheryl
27
-  (2ND )                             27 The sun begins to set, basking the mountain range in a magnificent light
28
-    #2 -                 28 Mike and Sheryl move right along
Still not speaking
The path forks at a
Mike stops, faces the falls, turns to see
Sheryl behind him, catching up
As she does, she slips
You alright
(balances herself) Yeah
She's about to walk past him, but he reaches for Sheryl's hand and holds it
'm sorry
Do you know how many times 've had someone die on me
How many children
stopped keeping count
thought
wasn't thinking
What do you want me to do
27
Get rid of the gun
What
now
Out here
She holds firm
can't just leave it here in the woods, some kid could find it
Then get rid of the bullets now and when we get home, you get rid of the gun
Mike thinks about it
His instincts  not to do this, then
Please
Mike relents
He removes his backpack,  it open
He pulls out the gun, opens it, spills the bullets out
Mike    ,    into the woods
Was that all of them
Yes
Mike steps back to Sheryl, they hug
Thank you
strange sound, like wood snapping, startles Sheryl
Mike turns as well
Their eyes
The  emerges from the clearing, practically landing on top of them
It's
, a Park Ranger, mid-50's, friendly
He's got a weed cutter in his hands, wears a
He's just as surprised to see them
Sheryl and Mike breath a sigh and offer him a smile
Oh
Didn't mean to startle you folks
Just clearing some of the brush off () 17, 2006    28
(cont'd) the path
We had some heavy rains this past week, knocked some trees and branches down
One of the new recruits was supposed to do yesterday, but
if you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself
It's fine
We were led to believe this trail wasn't regularly patrolled
It's not, but
It's one of my favorite spots, so  often find an excuse to swing by
It's gorgeous
Yup
There are a couple more falls in the park, but none quite so
inviting as this one
Now don't take my word for it, you can see for yourself
How long's your stay
Just til Sunday
Yeah, no
The other falls are clear on the other side
It would take you a couple nights just to get there
Maybe next time
This is a quickie trip
Just getting out of the city for a couple days
The city, huh
Which
If it's Charleston,  wouldn't blame ya
Whole place smells like feet
gotta haul myself all the way down to the hospital there for my yearly because the darn 's rules and regulations won't let me visit the local Doc
Not my cup of tea at all, but if you like it there, then
No, we're not from Charleston
17, 2006             29
But apparently we look like we are
We live in Alexandria
It's just outside of
Oh
've been there, few years back
Now that city  like
Lotta beautiful churches if  recall correctly
Which congregation do y'all belong to
Um
Not sure
Sheryl keeps track of all that for us
Sheryl
Sheryl gives Mike the "you're an asshole" look
Then
Uh
We're between congregations at the moment
Awkward
Well
should get back to work
Sun'll be down soon and that path ain't gettin'clear on its own
Clyde walks off, until
Excuse me
Sir
Sheryl doesn't know his name
Clyde stops, turns back
The name's Clyde
Clyde, would you recommend a nice spot nearby to make camp for the night
Be happy too
Let's see
Oh, got it
"Five Corners" will be perfect
It's just a bit up the ways here, near the Lake
It's five large rocks which sit in a clearing with a view of the whole park
The rocks retain the heat from the day, so if you set up camp between them you won't be so cold
30
Sounds perfect
Thanks
Just doing my job
You have fun and be careful
Good evening
Clyde tips his cap and disappears
29
-                                       29 Mike and Sheryl hike up a steep slope
As they step through the woods, they look upon
, arranged in an awkward semi-circle
They walk into the circle, take off their backpacks
This is incredible
Mike opens the tent pouch, starts removing the many parts
Ranger said there's a lake near by
What
The lake
'd kill to rinse off
Sheryl makes a move
Whoa
Wait a sec
It'll be dark soon
Where's your sense of adventure
She takes off
Sher
Seriously
Let's wait `til morning
30    --                                                 30 On  as she stops
Looks out towards the water
31
-   '
Two different colors, with his left being void of almost all color
Also notice  around the left eye, there's no eyebrow and his skin is pale and splotchy
The Concealed Figure holds all his attention on
31    --                                              31 Sheryl realizes he's right and walks back over to Mike
Fine
Mike stares at the many assorted parts of the tent, the sheet of instructions laid out
He holds one of the poles, which consists of separate links connected by a string
He has no idea where to begin
Do you know what you are doing
think its pretty obvious that don't
Sheryl laughs
32
,     -         32 The Concealed Figure retreats into the forest
: 33
-                                  33 Crickets chirp, but aside from that, peace and quiet reign
fire
tent for two has been pitched
Dirty pots, pans litter the area
Dinner's over and done
Mike and Sheryl cuddle by the fire
sleeping bag wrapped around them
That was
the worst dinner ever
(Beat) You cooked
32
Yeah, 'm aware
(Beat) You know what would make this evening perfect
Moonshine
got a whole jar of it
There's a sentence  never thought 'd say
" have a jar of moonshine
" Matter of fact, 've got enough to share with our entire congregation
in Charleston
Our home city, of course
But should start with you
Would you like some moonshine
Sheryl smiles, shakes her head playfully
Then what would you like
'd like to fuck you
Not very Christian of you
'm more Old Testament
What's that mean
Not sure
But  think it's the nastier of the two books
Sheryl pulls Mike into her, they kiss
Strong and deep
Sheryl abruptly breaks the kiss, enough foreplay
She stands up, pulls Mike into the tent with her
34
-                                             34 Sheryl pulls off her sweatshirt, then the -shirt
Mike kicks off his shoes, drops his pants
Mike unbuttons Sheryl's jeans, tugs them off
Sheryl unhooks her bra, tosses it aside
Mike slides her panties down her legs and off
33
Few things in life can be described as perfect
Sheryl's naked body is one of them
Sheryl pulls Mike's boxers down, climbs on top of him
She reaches down and slides Mike inside her
Sheryl  Mike
He slides his hands around Sheryl's butt
Sheryl paws his chest, bites his lower lip
The lovers move in unison
Perfection
35
-   -                                  35 Inside the tent, Mike and Sheryl continue
Their campfire still burns
Suddenly
creeps into frame
Then a
Someone's outside their tent
36
-                                                   36 Breaths get shorter, stronger
Sheryl and Mike build to climax
They don't/ can't notice
passes across the wall of the tent
The last final moments before
climax
The lovers
Sheryl crashes on top of Mike
He wraps his arms tightly around her
: 36
-                                             36 The last  on the fire slowly
36
-                                             36 Mike and Sheryl spoon, their hands and fingers messed together as one
was good
mean, even better than usual
If you don't say so
if  don't say so myself, yeah
Top notch performance
What, you disagree
34
Nah, it was good
Do you think  had anything to do
No
All me
Fine
(Beat; cautious) liked what the old woman said about us earlier
What did she say
That she thought we were married
(Groans) You are relentless
Mike gets up, starts dressing
wouldn't be a proper girlfriend if didn't nag every now and then
get it, but it makes me feel like the bad guy every time
Which makes me feel like shit
'm sorry
didn't mean that
Where are you going
Do out there, what you did in here
What's that
Put out the fire
Mike exits
Sheryl lies back down, exhales in frustration
37
-   -                          37 Mike, now fully dressed, pours a bucket of water over the campfire
In the background, bags hang from a tree (just as Ranger Sam asked them to do
) 35
smoldering mist of smoke is all that's left of the fire
Mike drops the bucket, heads for the tent, when
He suddenly stops, notices
Mike compares his boot to it
It's not the same size
Mike surveys the area
All's quiet now
But an uneasy feeling has crept back into his bones
Mike climbs back inside the tent, zips it shut
: 38
-                                     38 The sun peeks over the horizon and through the clouds crows
39
-                                                 39 Sheryl's eyes  open
She's nestled comfortably in Mike's arms
He's still asleep
40
-   -                                  40 Sheryl, now dressed, towel in hand, bandana wrapped around her hair, vomits behind some trees
After, she takes a couple deep breaths, swishes some water in her mouth
beat later, she heads off
41
-                                                 41 Sheryl stands on the lake's shore, checks a couple times over both shoulders
Then, she takes her sweats and bandana off
Lay them on top of her towel
Sheryl, wearing only her locket, carefully steps into the water
it's cold
But nevertheless her desire to feel clean outweighs the temperature discomfort
On her own little count to three
She dunks her head below the water
As she drops out of sight, -- , ,
Sheryl  up, turns towards land and is gone
Sheryl comes back to land
She grabs her towel, dries her hair and pats herself dry
She pulls on her sweatpants, 36
starts to tie her bandana around her head, and turns straight into
-   / The sound resonates over
42
-                                              42 Mike opens his eyes
Something woke him up, not exactly sure what
He sits up and yawns, stretches his stiff body
He's alone in the tent
43
-   -                               43 Mike, now dressed, stands behind a tree, takes a piss
He shudders slightly
It's cold
Mike finishes his business, grabs his water bottle and takes a long drink
He peels off the bandage from his hand
It looks fine today
He looks around, but no sign of Sheryl
44
-                                              44 Mike walks up to the water, looks in both directions
Nothing
pang of concern registers
He kneels down, cups some water and splashes it over his face, hair
As he opens his eyes, he notices something
In the wash of the waves, sparkling in the sunlight
It's Sheryl's locket
The chain broken
He picks it up
(Calls out) Sheryl
Mike looks around
He's completely alone
The blood drains from his face
Mike pockets the necklace
He starts into the water
did she drown
Just as he gets knee deep
:
Mike stops, turns back looking at the forest
Sheryl
He hustles out of the water, heading for the woods
37
45
-                                   45 Mike hustles through the thick patch of trees and hits the steep little slope
He flies up the slope but loses traction and slips,  his knee
Fuck
(Top of his lungs) Sheryl
Mike pushes himself up, continues on
46
#2 -                                46 Mike's really moving now
He scoots through the first patch of trees and hustles down a slope
47
,    -                        47 Mike emerges from the woods, drops into a clearing
Looking around wildly
- Has he been here before
It all looks the same
Not even sure which direction he just came from
Sheryl
Still nothing
Mike swallows
What to do now
: 48
#1 -     -                   48 as he races through the trees trample over rocks, dirt, shrubs
Then
Mike , falls down
He lifts his forearm to reveal ,  and a    sticking out
The sight of it almost makes Mike puke right then and there
Mike grabs hold of the splinter, turns his head
takes about a thousand short quick breaths and He removes the   from his back pocket, wraps it around his wound
Mike lays back, stares up into the sky
Tries to catch his breath, calm down
Then
Faint sound of
38
Mike sits up
Again, faint sound of
Mike stands, takes a couple of steps toward the sound Mike's got the scent, takes off in its direction
49
#2,     -                   49 Mike follows the  through a thick patch of trees
He stops at the top and looks down
- Walking along the main path, obscured by the trees, is Darryl and Lonnie
They drink,  about something
Lonnie carries some fishing poles
Mike's about fifteen feet above them
He narrows his focus in on
'  - Darryl twirling something in his hand
It's Sheryl's blue hikers' towel
Mike turns red with fury
He looks back down
'  - Darryl, a  slung around his shoulder
Mike looks around and spots a large pointed stick lying near a tree, parallel to him
50
#4 -                              50 Darryl and Lonnie continue along, until
:
Darryl stops, turns
Lonnie looks at Daryl
What is it
Hear something
Darryl holds his look into the woods, then
Nah
It's nothing
Suddenly, Mike  from behind a tree,  the surprised Darryl across the face with the stick
Darryl drops like a sack of potatoes
Mike locks eyes with a terrified Lonnie
Where is she
Lonnie pauses, frozen
He then takes off, disappearing through the trees
39
Darryl lies on the ground,
He pushes himself up to his knees
from a fresh gash across his head
Mike grabs Darryl's shotgun, aims at Darryl
Whoa
take it easy
Where is she
Who
What the fuck you talking about
What did you do to her
didn't fuckin' do nothing
don't know
Mike  Darryl across   with the barrel
You have Sheryl's towel
What the fuck did you do to her
Darryl's a mess, his nose busted
He gags on blood and teeth
Mike stares at the bloody desight that is Darryl
Even Mike has to turn away for a moment for this
Then
Foun' towel
What
foun' the towel
You found it
That's you're fucking story, you inbred fuck
(Points gun at Darryl's head) Stop fucking lying or  will kill you
40
Don' kill me
Please
foun' it
Up
Up the paf back `dere
just a bit ago
fuckin'swear
Mike's finger itches the trigger
He's turning red
Breathing hard, heavy
Then
Mike relents
Lowers the weapon, turns his back to Darryl, stares into the woods
The tension fades for the moment
But only a moment
Didn't think you had dat in you, city boy
(Looks at his shirt; the blood) Shit
just got dis shirt
Darryl, while Mike is distracted, seizes his opportunity, reaches behind
- Darryl slides a   from his back pocket
Damn shame you lost dat fine piece o'ass
Something dat sweet don't come'round every day
Even for pretty folk like you
Shut the fuck up
- Still concealed from Mike, Darryl opens the pocket knife, the  fully extended
You best hope you find her'fore  do
`cause  will enjoy tearing her ass apart
(Mike turns, faces Darryl) And when 'm done there,  will cut her eyeballs out and skull fuck her
(Mike simmers to a boil) Any luck, Brody's already beat me to it
Sonofabitch
Mike takes a step towards Darryl, when
Darryl ,
Darryl misses with his initial swipe, but it's enough to knock Mike down, the shotgun falls to the side
41
Darryl pins Mike to the ground, tries to dagger the knife into him, but Mike grabs his wrist
They struggle
Darryl down, the knife    ' , until
Mike - Darryl, sending the skinny Hick off him
Darryl rolls away in pain
Mike scrambles, crawls for
the shotgun
He grabs it
Darryl regroups, turns around, but is met with
bashes Darryl's face with the butt
This knocks Darryl completely out
Mike stands over Darryl
beat
Then
51
-  (2ND )                                 51 The morning fog has dissipated as streaks of sunlight pierce the cloudy skies
52
-                                          52 Mike arrives back at their campsite, shotgun in tow
He freezes, completely floored
Everything is gone
The tent, the backpacks, the mess kits, everything
Even the fire pit
Mike looks around, turning, looking
completely helpless
He  open the shotgun - he's got two shells
He closes it, heads back into the woods
53                                                                 53 54
#3,    -                         54 Mike moves deeper into the woods
He's a mix of paranoia and determination
Mike pauses, catching his breath, when Mike wipes his face, looks at the blood
What the fuck
couple more  hit him
Mike
,      , secured by coarse thick ropes
42
Mike takes a terrified step backwards, unaware ,
Mike, still mesmerized by the blood and the deer, continues backing up
getting closer to the bear trap
closer
his foot
, Mike
He drops to the ground, stares at his leg, now a bloody mess of flesh and steel
Mike writhes in pain on the ground
His eyes watering
The pain
Then
'  - Someone or thing appears, stepping from the forest
They come closer The  keeping their identity hidden
Mike's eyelids flutter, can't determine who/what it is
The pain overwhelms him
He doesn't care any longer
Then
Ida bends down next to Mike
Michael, can you hear me
Michael
Her words fade out
He promptly
:
: 55
'  -                                        55 - Mike's eyes  open, dart side to side, blink
- Mike lays on a ragged couch
The place is dark and dusty
glance around
Gaslights hang in the corners
stack of logs rest next to an old fireplace
Just off the main room is a kitchen alcove, with a coal stove
On the stove a
Mike's memory slowly comes back
He leans up when
Ow
43
sharp pain shoots through his body
Mike reaches for his leg
The tourniquet conceals the damage
damn towel is wrapped around where the wound is
bandage has replaced the Gray Bandana on his arm
Ida enters the cabin from the back door, into the kitchen
She removes the teapot from the burner
The whistling stops
Look who's up
Where am
You're in my home, Michael
You gave me quite a scare
thought  lost you
Ida grabs a wet wash cloth, wrings it out over a basin and walks back to Mike
Lucky the snap didn't break the bone, just bruised it
know that's of little comfort now, but trust me, it's a good thing
That dirty trap however's prime for spreading infection, need to finish cleaning out that wound and then 'll get some "evening primrose" in you
Same stuff the Indian Tribes used it back in the day to heal, well
just about everything
So's do
Ida unwraps the tourniquet, examines the wound
Try and relax
Ida cleans the wound
Mike winces
He can't watch
Thank you
For saving my life
You don't have to thank me
Up here, we take care of one another
That's the only way any of us survive
Um
(Thinks
) 'm sorry, but  don't know your name
17, 2006      44
Oh for the sake of sunshine
how rude a host am
Name's Ida Foster
Ida moves to the kitchen, grabs a mason jar with clear liquid
It looks just like the jar Mike bought from Brody
Ida,  need some help
'm moving as fast as  can, sweetie
No, not me
It's Sheryl
My girlfriend
You met her with me yesterday
Something's happened to her
She was gone this morning when woke up
looked everywhere and couldn't find her
We need to call someone
Ranger
Somebody
We need to find her right away
Do you have a phone
'm sorry, but  don't
Never really had use for one
(Beat) do have a radio
We can call down to base if you'd like
Ida comes back to the couch
After we take care of you
'm fine, Ida, please
if you could call now
You want to lose this leg
Cause that's what you're risking
Soon as we're done, 'll call
Okay
Mike concedes
Ida hands a second rag to Mike
Bite down on this
ain't gonna lie
Lotta pain about to hit you sweetheart
45
Mike puts the rag in his mouth
Ida dips the used cloth in the moonshine
He closes his eyes , and
Ida applies the moonshine to the wound
Mike  through the cloth
It's okay
It's almost over
Ida repeats
Mike  again
His eyes water
Ida offers her palm
Mike opens his mouth
The cloth falls into her hand
Mike  , coming down from the pain
Ida crosses to the kitchen, disposes of the two wash cloths and grabs a larger towel
She walks back to Mike and wraps his calf with the towel
We'll get some of that primrose in you and you'll be good as new
Ida
The radio
Please
Can you call down please
'll take care of it right now
Ida heads to a closed door on the far side of the room
She opens and enters, sure to close the door behind her
Mike relaxes, as best he can anyway
Until
,
() Ida, you in there
'  - Through a small slit in the drapes, Brody waits outside
Ida exits the room, heads for the door
(Whispers) He's looking for me
(Whispers; concerned) Why's that
46
() Ida
(Whispers) think he had something to do with Sheryl going missing
,
(Whispers) 'll take care of it
() Ida, lemme in
'm coming
Ida helps Mike stand, re-directs him to the kitchen alcove
He winces all the way
She leans him up against the near wall so that he is out of view of the door
Ida goes to the front door, opens it halfway, revealing an agitated Brody, shotgun in hand
Suspicious, Brody tries to peek past Ida into the cabin
She doesn't budge
What took you so long
What do you want, Brody
'm looking for a man hiker
This "man hiker" alone or wit someone
He had a lady friend, but
'm just looking for him now
- Listening nervously
Well,  ain't seen no one in days
Brody glares at her
She glares right back
Brody again tries to see past her into the cabin, but she blocks him
47
What'd he do you for anyway
He busted Darryl's face in with a shotgun
Left him a mess of blood and teeth
Nearly killed him
(Beat) You spot anyone you don't know, you be sure to find me
Fine
Brody eyeballs Ida one last time, then leaves
Ida watches him go, closes the door and heads to the alcove
He's gone
Brody and those boys are a pain in the backside
'm sure that cousin of his had it coming
Ida leads Mike back to the couch
What did the Ranger say
Does he need to speak to me
When is he coming
Ida heads back to the kitchen, grabs a mug and pours hot water into it
She dishes a small spoonful of yellow powder into the hot water
Sorry,  wasn't able to reach anyone
Ida stirs the powder in as she walks back to Mike
God damnit
Ida pauses
then: Please don't take the Lord's name in vain in this house
She  ,  and  at Mike, until
'm sorry
Drink this
48
Ida hands him the steaming mug
Mike's mind races
Something's not right
'm sure they're just on rounds and will be back any minute
We'll try them again and we'll find Sheryl
You'll see
She probably just took a wrong turn up here, ended up in the middle of "don't know where
" Happens lots of times
(Looks to the mug) Please drink up, Michael, it will make you feel better
Mike holds the mug, stares at the drink
He puts it to his lips but then stops, looks at Ida
She stares at him
Unnerved by the stare, Mike lowers the mug without sipping
What's wrong
How did you know my name
(Confused) Excuse me
Michael
You keep calling me Michael
You did it just now
You did before, just after  woke up
You called me Michael
Nobody calls me Michael
'm sure you're mistaken
You musta told me before
No,  would have told you "Mike
" Only my grandmother, who's dead, ever called me Michael
Well, how else could  have known your name
- '
17, 2006    49
(Beat; thinks
) On my driver's license and credit cards, it says Michael
If you stole my wallet from the campsite
that's how you'd have known
Long beat
You're accusing me of stealing your wallet
saved your life
Twice
Why would  steal your wallet
(Mike doesn't respond) Now, just drink your primrose
Fuck the primrose
Mike  the mug across the room
It
Mike lifts himself up
Despite the pain, he heads for the room Ida went in to make the radio call
Where do you think you're going
want to call the Ranger myself
Ida springs to her feet, jumps in front of Mike
'm getting in that room, Ida
Mike maneuvers around her, when
Ida grabs the iron fire poker by the stove, holds it like a baseball bat
can't let you in there
Mike takes a step forward
Ida  the poker
Nearly hits Mike
Mike jukes left, she  again
Misses
Where is Sheryl, Ida
She's in that room, isn't she
You sinners are all alike
heard you last night
Spitting in the face () 50
(cont'd) of the Lord and his laws
Dining on the sins of the flesh
: 56
-   -                            56 Inside the tent, Mike and Sheryl make love
Their campfire still burns
Suddenly
creeps into frame
Then a
:
: 57
'  -                                          57 Suddenly, Ida appears in a new light
You and your bitch whore girlfriend will atone for your sins
Mike  forward, grabs hold of the poker before Ida can swing it again
,
The poker falls to the floor
Ida  on Mike's back, wraps her arms around his throat
Mike spins Ida around in circles, then  Ida up against the wall
The two fall to the floor
Mike pushes himself up, but before he can get away
,
Instinctively, Mike kicks Ida in the face, boot to nose

Mike is , glances at Ida
She's out cold
Mike pushes himself up, limps to the door
He grabs the handle,

He steps over to the radio, when he notices
17, 2006       51
He swipes it with his finger
This thing hasn't been used in years
Mike turns, steps on a throw-rug laying in the center of the floor

Mike tests the floor board again
It's

Mike grabs the latch, lifts it open

Carefully, Mike makes his way down the steps, into

Crosses, photos of Jesus, statues of Mary, etc
Don the walls, shelves

On the far side of the room
like an altar shrine -  , all in various stages of development and
Each jar is labelled with their own individual bronze nameplate (#1,

The nameplate reads, "

Next to the door, a light switch
He flips it
Sounding like small gunshots, a series of overhead lights illuminating a long, narrow, curved hallway
At the far end
( )  sound
It's distant, muffled
indistinguishable
Mike stirs, hearing the faint, muted sound from the end of the hallway
Mike staggers, leans against the wall for support
He's woozy, but determined
He proceeds down the hall, towards the doors
Just as Mike passes underneath a light ,   onto Mike
As he brushes himself off
52
cries out
Sheryl
Mike moves faster, reaches the end of the hallway, faces the door
He turns the knob, pushes it open, and

Sheryl, tied to a beam that extends from the ceiling to the floor, a coarse rope secures a gag in her mouth
She's bruised with a lot of nicks and scratches
Sheryl and Mike's eyes lock
Euphoria, pain all at once
Oh my God
Mike runs to her, touches her face
He checks the ropes tying Sheryl
They're very secure
need something to cut you down, baby
Sheryl tries to motion to the other side of the room
Mike follows her gaze
Searching wildly
scanning the room
a tool bench
tools

hammer, screw drivers, axes, a , then, finally
in the middle of bunch
'
Mike grabs the knife, hobbles back to Sheryl
He slides the blade between her cheek and the rope,
Several tense moments later
the rope breaks
Mike tosses the rope and gag away
They kiss
Are you okay
Get me out of here
Hurry
Mike starts cutting the ropes around her wrists
He'll be back soon
53
Who's he
:    resounds
Where did it come from
Not wanting or waiting to find out, Mike doubles the effort
Come on, come on, come on
Finally, the ropes tear
Sheryl's free
Just as
Sheryl lets rip a short, but loud
Mike quickly silences her
Mike and Sheryl take refuge in each other's arms
Then
Mike remembers
on the tool bench
He feels around for the bench, when
Fuck
He banged his injured leg on something
(Whispers) What are you doing
Mike reaches the tool bench, feels around
Finds it
(Whispers) Mike
Mike
Mike
The beam  through the darkness and onto
The Concealed Figure, stands face to face with Mike brandishing his axe/sickle
The Concealed Figure swings the axe/sickle, slices Mike across the forearm
Mike  in pain, drops the flashlight and knife
Sheryl, run
But Sheryl freezes

He comes at Mike again, but
he eludes the attack
Mike grabs the flashlight, the only weapon within his reach, and ,       , he drops to the ground
The Concealed Figure grabs Mike by the throat, runs him as hard and fast as he can against a wall
Sheryl's frozen in fear
He  his throat harder, tighter
Mike can't breathe
Mike smacks the Concealed Figure in the face, squirms, all to no avail, until
Mike  his
He ,  Mike
They both fall to the floor
The fallen flashlight's beam illuminates Sheryl backed in the corner
(To Sheryl) Get the fuck out of here
Now
Finally Sheryl runs out of the room

#1 - '                   64 As the Concealed Figure writhes in pain
Mike catches his breath, attempts to stand, only
his body buckles under the pain
He throws a look to the Figure, then crawls over to the tool bench
He pulls himself up using the bench for support
He haphazardly feels for a weapon
any weapon
He grabs a hammer, turns and
The Figure grabs Mike's wrist, then -  between the eyes
He falls to the floor
Out cold
The Concealed Figure holds his injured eye with one hand, grabs the / with the other

When she gets up, the first thing she sees
She coughs violently, almost pukes
She stumbles, hurries up the trap door steps
moment later
The Concealed Figure pops through the iron door
For the first time we see the Concealed Figure wholly
Half his body scarred, burned
He stands well over six feet tall, muscles rippling everywhere frightful sight
He peers up the trap door steps, pursues Sheryl

Runs after her

trips over some tree roots
She falls
She pushes herself out of the puddle
She's soaked, but doesn't stop
She resumes running
closing the gap

Has no idea where she's going
Then suddenly she hears something
She looks down a slight hill

She  Clyde tightly, starts crying
He looks at her

Oh my stars, what happened to you

My boyfriend came
And this man's chasing me
He's chasing me right now
Calm down
can't make heads or tails of what you're saying
He's coming
He's right behind me
Clyde looks up into the woods from where Sheryl came, but
all's peaceful at the moment
No Deacon
Look, miss, there's no one there
Oh my God, Mike
57
- Clyde, his back to us, consoles Sheryl
Deacon steps into frame
Sickle/Axe in hand
He starts toward Clyde and Sheryl
It's going to be fine, Miss promise you
Everything's going to be fine
Sheryl pries her face from Clyde's chest
'  - Deacon's five feet behind Clyde and closing
Off her look, Clyde turns The moment's frozen
For too long
Something's not right
Deacon, what's going on
How the heck did she escape
Sheryl looks at Clyde, in shock
Deacon lowers his head, ashamed
Want something done, gotta do it yourself
Clyde removes a black, wooden club from his belt

As it moves towards Mike
Deacon, a black ring surrounds his injured eye, steps in front of Mike, holds the blade  from Mike's eye
An eye for an eye
Mike wakes and
immediately freaks out
He tries to shake loose, but can't
Deacon stares at him, but
(
) Deacon
Clyde enters
He wears a long garment around his neck, carries a bible
That's enough
Get him ready
Deacon backs off
He undoes a slipknot on the far wall, which causes Mike to come  to the floor
Deacon lifts Mike to his feet, positions him
It's only now Mike gets a gander at the room
The   adorn the far wall
There's a giant hanging over a makeshift altar
anywhere and everywhere
An old phonograph, one that you  to play, rests in the corner
Clyde places the needle down on a record, The  kicks in,
It's hollow, full of static and futz
Mike watches

The iron door slowly  open
-
Ropes secure the ankles so movement's limited to inches at a time
Shimmying into the room, wearing a dusty, old wedding dress and a flower wreath in her hair is Sheryl
Her wrists still bound
Her mouth gagged
Mike and Sheryl take each other in
Tears spring to Sheryl's eyes
She takes another jerky step closer
Ida is visible behind her, guides her towards Mike
She positions her next to him so that both face the altar
Clyde glances to Ida who silences the music
And Jesus answered and said unto them, "Each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband
The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband
" Amen
And so, in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ,  ask you Michael
and you Sheryl, do you accept the sacred covenant of marriage
Mike and Sheryl stare at Clyde
Neither flinch
Clyde glances to Deacon, who immediately steps forward, touches the sickle blade to Sheryl's throat
'll ask again
Do you accept this covenant of marriage
Sheryl nods immediately
Mike nods too
Clyde signals for Deacon to step back
He obeys
Then by the power vested in me, pronounce you man and wife
Clyde signals to Ida
60
Ida removes Sheryl's graduation ring from her finger
She then slides    , one on Sheryl's finger, the other on Mike's
Clyde unties the rope securing Mike's gag in his mouth, removes it
Why are you doing this
We did nothing to you people
Let us go
You may kiss the bride
You fucking people are fucking sick
Clyde's temper flares
(Stern and cold) Do not use that type of language in this house again
Now
kiss the bride or
(Gestures to Deacon) he'll cut off your lips
Mike stares in horror at Clyde, turns to Sheryl
love you
Mike kisses her briefly on the cheek
Clyde smiles satisfied, nods to Deacon
He immediately lifts Sheryl up and throws her over his shoulder
What are you doing
Deacon carries her from the room
Sheryl
(To Clyde) Let her go
Please, let her go
Clyde pulls the ropes, hoists Mike back into a dangling position
He secures the knot before exiting the room
(To Ida) () 61
(cont'd) Please
Don't hurt her
Whatever it is you want, 'll give it to you
know you will
She stuffs the gag in, secures it in place with the rope
She ties the knot
Perfect
Ida exits the room
Mike is alone
Mike tries to yank his hands through the knot
His wrists and hands turn red, his face is flushed
the knot is too tight
He stops
Mike takes a breath and tries again
His face and hands are beet red
He pulls and pulls
but the rope doesn't budge
Mike exhales
It's no use
He dangles there, helpless

Clyde enters
Clyde unties the end of the rope on the floor
The rope , Mike  to the ground
Clyde picks him up, sits him in a nearby chair
Mike's wrists, ankles and mouth still bound and gagged
Gonna untie your mouth, now
Have a little "man to man" talk
Clyde undoes the gag in Mike's mouth
Please
It's not too late
Let us go
We won't tell anyone
(Beat) How well do you know your bible, Michael
Jesus Fucking Christ
Clyde  Mike across the face
62
told you before to watch that mouth, mister
Fuck you
Clyde  him, not once, but twice
He readies a third
You through
Mike spits some blood on the floor
Nods
'll ask again
how well do you know the bible
Not very
That's okay
It's fine
That's why am here

Still gagged
She wears a new outfit
handmade dress with a small crest embroidered over the heart
' (      )
Ida pulls tight the rope securing her wrists to the arms of the chair
Satisfied
'll be right back
Ida exits the room
Deacon stands by the door
He and Sheryl alone together
Sheryl tries not to make eye contact
Deacon stares at her
Longingly
'  - On Sheryl's chest, expanding and contracting with every breath
- '  - Sheryl, a heavenly glow encircles her (and her gag mysteriously gone), turns to Deacon
look of calm and lust in her eyes
63
want you, Deacon
(Jump Cut to
) want you to fuck me
Hard

Sheryl, the heavenly glow gone, her gag back in place
Watches Deacon
She squirms, cries

Lord knows the will of a man gets tested
Cruelly most times
But the righteous persevere
They do what needs to be done, even though they don't want to
It's what makes a man, a man
Let me tell you the story of Judas, he was one of Jesus's apostles
Judas led Roman Soldiers to the capture and eventual death of our Lord Jesus Christ
And now, is supposedly seated next to Satan, his soul burning in hell forever for this sin
But don't believe that's the case
have my own theory
The death of Jesus was predicted thousands of years before Judas ever came along
And for the prophecy to be fulfilled, Jesus had to die
If he didn't, the gates of heaven couldn't be opened for mankind
don't think, for an instant, Judas wanted to be the one, but
someone had to
Judas helped Jesus, so Jesus could die for our sins
Save us all
And  believe at this moment
Judas is in heaven, despite his sin, because it led to the greater good
(Beat) Relations prior to marriage is a sin
You and Sheryl are sinners in the Lord's eyes
And because of those sins, your souls are damned
But Ida and Me, we're gonna give you a chance to save your souls and do the right thing, but
as previously stated, you will need to persevere and show the strength and will of your character
But you'll do it
Because that's what needs to be done

Mike stares unflinching at Clyde

#1 -                                75 Deacon kneels before Sheryl who tries to move, but can't
- Deacon lays his scarred hand on Sheryl's thigh
Sheryl squirms, but that's all she can do
Then
(
) Deacon
Deacon jumps up, backs off
You get away from her
Git
Now
Ida sets a tray she was carrying down, chases Deacon from the room
She shuts the door behind him
'm sorry about that, Sugar
My brother, he's not well
She retrieves the tray, brings it over closer to Sheryl
It's not all his fault
Our father wasn't very Christian and then there was the accident
Along with the scarring, lost use of his vocals
Can't speak a lick
Now, 've spoken to him
What happened with the others won't happen to you
He's promised me that
What others
What did he do
'm gonna take that out of your mouth now
brought you some tea, got some primrose in it
Help you relax, get some rest
Okay
Ida unties the gag in Sheryl's mouth
She coughs a few times
Ida raises the mug of tea to her lips
Please don't do this
Please let me go
Please
just want to go home
17, 2006             65
(Cold) Drink the tea
Ida brings the mug to her lips again, pours some in Sheryl's mouth
She swallows a big gulp
That's better
Good girl
(Changing topics) almost forgot to ask
How does it feel being married
Why are you doing this
thought you'd be happy about that
All  ever wanted out of life was two things
to be married and to have a baby
The Lord blessed me with Clyde and  thank Him every day for that
Ida pours some more tea into Sheryl
But having a baby's been
complicated

-                                           76 Clyde walks over to the fetus jars
Stares at them sadness in his eyes
She can conceive fine
just
can't seem to make it all the way through
Timothy was the toughest
Made it to month eight
- The "Timothy" Fetus jar
The most developed of them all
City Doctor had some fancy mumbo-jumbo words for the condition
(Beat; turns to Mike) Breaks my heart every time
That woman was born to be a mother
It's her calling in life
Just like you and Sheryl have a calling
What exactly do you want from us

Her  heavy
The primrose "kicking in

You're young, strong
It's gonna be easy for you
Not like me

You're gonna have a baby, Sheryl
(Beat) My baby

Deacon drags Mike inside, Clyde right behind them
To Mike's horror
Oh my God
Sheryl lies unconscious on top of the table, Ida by her side
- Each of her limbs tied down with heavy rope
Her legs are spread apart
What have you done to her
She'll be out for hours, but she's fine
Ida'll come back in a little bit, check to see that the deed has been done
If it hasn't
the next time you see your little lady
a piece of her will be missing
() 17, 2006          67
(cont'd) (Cold) Don't test us on that one
Now, we know conception's not automatic
So don't feel like all the pressure's on right now
We're prepared to do this however long it takes
You give us the effort each time, eventually the magic will happen
You're out of your fucking minds
Clyde grabs Mike's wrist, turns over his palm
Clyde takes a knife from his belt,  '
What did  tell you about the language
Ida grabs a fresh rag, wraps Mike's hand in it
Deacon will be right outside that door
The only door
This room has no windows and is buried twenty feet below ground
Cutting to the chase
there's no way out and you can scream yourself hoarse, no one will hear you
We'll let you have your privacy now
(Remembers) Oh, almost forgot
Ida goes to the corner where the phonograph sits
She cranks the handle, places the needle on the record
The record crackles, Pachelbel's "Canon" fills the room
Deacon, Clyde and Ida exit
They  and  the door behind them

He pulls himself to his feet
He takes Sheryl in
She looks peaceful
He runs his good hand through her hair
Tears roll down his cheeks
Mike checks each of Sheryl's ropes
They are all tightly secured
Mike haphazardly checks every nook and cranny of the room
But Clyde was right
No way out
Mike stares at the phonograph

(He's hooked up the same way the Young Man was in the opening scene of the story
) Deacon secures the last of the restraints
Clyde enters, walks straight up to Mike
Was  at all unclear yesterday
No, but
Did you understand what was expected of you
Yes, but
How do you expect
Clearly you did not understand
You did not even attempt relations last evening
What you're asking to do is sick
You're sick
You didn't have a problem when penetration was a sin, but when it's your wife, it's sick
Unbelievable
Clyde glares angrily at Mike, then heads to the door
You knew the rules, Michael
warned you
Now, Deacon, here, will remind you
Mike turns to Deacon, who stands over the tool bench of sharp instruments of torture lay before him
Clyde shuts the door on Mike

Sheryl's tied to chair
Her hand is secured to table top
She can't move it
Fingers separated
What are they doing to him
You should concern yourself with what's about to happen to you
Ida opens a  , but instead of needles and yarn, she removes a

Sheryl looks at the cleaver, then
to her hand
the pinky finger separated and immobile
What are you doing, Ida
You think you're so much smarter than me, don't you
No
Yes you do
Admit it'cause  can see it in your eyes, darling
With your fancy schools and job and such
(Realizes) You think you are better than me
No,  don't
Yes she does
(Beat) Might surprise you, but  was quite the student back in the day
Straight 's
Every subject'cept for Science
Infuriated me how they tried to explain away the Lord's creations
Our teacher, Mr
Billings, once said
in the future, humans won't be born with a pinky finger'cause of evolution
(Frustration building) Of all the
shouted, "No
We are created in the Lord's image
not some nonsensical theory by Darwind
" Sheryl stares at Ida, terrified would be an understatement
suppose Mr
Billings and Mr
Darwind can stand up and cheer, because you, little lady
you're about to evolve

Deacon faces Mike, looks him square in the eyes
He walks back to the tool bench, lays the whipping device down
Mike breathes a touch easier, until
Deacon reappears,     in his hands
He dips one of his scarred fingers into the liquid and  touches a wound on Mike's body
The liquid stings

It's not your fault
There are a lot of women that can't carry a baby full term

Clyde stands on the banks of a algae covered swamp
He stares out, nervously watching
Brody, in his beat-up Pick-up truck, pulls to a stop
Exits the truck, approaches Clyde
Clyde
'morning, Brody
stopped by your place the other day
Ida mentioned
So have you seen or heard anything about that man hiker
(Beat) In fact  have
saw him and his lady leave
When was this

Yesterday
Just before dusk
Bullshit
Believe what you want
Clyde looks out at the swamp, then back to Brody, who never stopped staring at Clyde
saw their car last night in the parking lot at base
So they didn't leave, "Just before dusk
" Well,  was down at base this morning
car's gone now
Something don't feel right here, Clyde
Between you and Ida
don't have time for this
He starts to walk away, but Brody grabs his wrist tightly
Take your hand off me, Brody
What do you know about that hiker you ain't telling me
Brody waits a beat, then lets him go
told you, Brody
saw them leave
Let it go
Brody watches Clyde head off
He's even more paranoid now than before

Her hand/finger bandaged

Deacon throws Mike roughly to floor
He's tied per usual
:    the back of Mike's shirt  in blood
How do you expect me to do this
Like this
Do we need to provide you with some more motivation
You wouldn't want to put that lovely bride of yours through a day like she had today again, now would you
You'll never get away with this
We have friends and family
They know where we went
They'll come looking for us
They'll find us
That may very well be
but they won't find your car
Clyde dangles the keys -   - in front of Mike
Deacon, Clyde and Ida leave

Mike limps over to Sheryl, he sees her bandaged hand
Oh baby, what did they do to you
'm sorry
'm so sorry
(Without moving, barely audible) Are they gone
(Surprised) Yeah
You're awake
Their entire conversation is no louder than a whisper

Sheryl turns to face Mike
They kiss
didn't swallow that shit she gave me
Sheryl spies the back of his jersey in a mirror's reflection
Oh my God
Mike
It's okay
'm okay
You're not okay
We're not okay
What are we gonna do
don't know
Sheryl takes a moment
Thinks carefully about how exactly to phrase this
Then
Maybe
we should just give them what they want
What
If it stops them from hurting you and me
maybe we should
Absolutely not
No fucking way
Forget the fact, that the moment you get pregnant, they'll kill me
Then the moment you give birth, you're dead
Beyond both of those reasons
ain't no fucking way  am going to give them our child
Tears  from Sheryl
For all my coward marriage moments
've thought about our child
Is that stupid
picture what he'll be like
He

Wishful thinking
picture your heart
your eyes
And  picture us, raising him
Growing old with him

Good morning, Sam
Ain't no better than any of the other days, Evelyn, so bring the "glee" down some, would ya

Sam grabs some papers from his mailbox
Evelyn's used to Sam's moods
Hey, Sam, do you remember a Virginia couple pass through here sometime Friday
Friday
Well
There was one couple, but they didn't say where they were from
Gal's mother's called three times this morning
Said she hasn't heard from her daughter since before she left and she didn't show up for work yesterday or today
She sure this was the park they were coming to
Yup
Woman's already offering up a reward
Damn it
Have her fax some photos up here
Notify patrol
Been a while since we had a couple go missing
Twelve months ago the last
Sam crosses to the bulletin board by the door
He studies the flier of the missing couple that Sheryl had noticed

Nothing happened
Clyde and Ida are pissed

We do appreciate your honesty, Michael
And believe me, we understand your extreme situation, but
Punishment's going to have to be handed down
Suddenly, Clyde's walkie-talkie goes off

) Clyde, it's Sam at base, come back
Go for, Clyde
Mike screams trying to be heard while Clyde has button pushed

Deacon holds Mike, while Ida grabs the gag
(
) Yeah, morning, Clyde
Got a missing person's report
Young Couple out of Alexandria
We're printing up some flyers with their photos right now
told you
told they'd be coming
Ida shoves the gag into his mouth, ties it secure
(
) When you get a chance, grab some and let's start circulating, huh
Clyde throws a concerned look to Ida

Get rid of the dope

Morning, gentlemen
(She eyes her watch) Pardon me
Afternoon
Evelyn, damn, hurts looking at you
When you gonna give it up to me
Now with a line like that, it's a shocker  haven't already
You stone cold tease
Was wondering if either of you had seen any hikers pass by in the last day or so
Lonnie's about to respond, but Brody cuts him off
What's this about
Evelyn hands them a flier
- Photos of Mike and Sheryl, name, info, etc
Brody's eyes light up
These two are missing
It would seem so
Why, have you seen them
Brody hesitates and then shakes his head "no"
81
You talk to Clyde about this
All the Rangers are on the lookout
Family's even offering up a reward
(Beat) How much
Pardon
How much they offering
Don't exactly know
'm guessing it's a fair amount
Well, me and Lonnie will keep a lookout for you too
Anything we can do to help
Evelyn begins walking off
You change you mind, 'll ride you raw
Evelyn ignores Lonnie, moves on her way

Her bloody hands, sans one finger, tremble softly
Her remaining digits start to her restraints

Also, rest buried in the coals
All glow a think we have to have another
man to man discussion, here, Michael
But unlike previous moments, Mike is not begging or pleading
He holds a calm demeanor

Deacon takes something from his pocket, lifts his arms up towards Sheryl's head
She winces, expecting the worst
Deacon slides Sheryl's locket around her neck
The chain repaired
Deacon beams with pride
Deacon shifts her skirt exposing more skin and places his hands on Sheryl's bare thighs
She twitches instinctively causing Deacon to squeeze her thighs
Sheryl winces in pain, stops her struggle
Locks  with Deacon
Suddenly, an aura of  falls over her

She resumes untying the knots

Her smell, form

We're not violent people, Michael
It pains us to pain you
don't know
Seems as though Deacon and yourselves get a real kick out of it
Now see, this is what  am talking about
It's your attitude
It's the disobedience, the cussing
Sooner we get what we want, then no further harm has to fall upon you and your wife
Way  see it, you need us alive
You need us, period
And now that Park Services and State Police are looking for us, you're starting to panic, () 84
(cont'd) knowing your whole plan's crumbling down before your eyes
(To Ida ) So you can stop spinning those fucking irons thinking you're scaring me, cause you're not

Her hands are free
Deacon looks into Sheryl's eyes
He senses something different
Does he know
Deacon pulls himself closer to Sheryl
Their faces only inches apart
He  her gag out of her mouth, lets it dangle around her neck
Sheryl swallows nervously
Resists the urge to scream
She's frozen
Then
Deacon leans in
Knowing it's now or never, Sheryl
He falls over in agony
Deacon looks up at her, when
She  him right in the face
Sheryl springs from the chair, grabs the sickle, turns and
Deacon, already back on his feet,  Sheryl hard across the jaw
She hits the wall, then falls to the floor, drops the sickle

Sheryl, still stunned from the punch, only now starts to realize what is happening to her

But, you keep dragging this thing out

happen
sent Deacon away for a bit
He knows he done wrong
You say right now that you are ready to perform your marital duties, then 'll keep him away

That's why he fucking kills them before they're born
Because you're fucking insane monsters that don't deserve a child
Ida  Mike
You take that back
No
Take it back
Ida digs her hand into Mike's bear trap wound, squeezes
But Mike doesn't scream or squirm
He endures the pain

Go ahead and torture me
There's absolutely no way  would ever give a child of mine to you
How very brave
Fine
won't torture you
(Looks to Sheryl) 'll torture her
can bring back Deacon
Let him have her
Plenty of other holes he can go into where a baby can't be made
Ida grabs a nearby knife, walks up to Sheryl
Or maybe we can just start dicing
All we need is a healthy heart, brain and uterus
She don't need the rest of her fingers, or toes
or her nose, ears
could carve out her eye right now
Ida places the knife on top of Sheryl's cheek, just below the eye
The tip just centimeters away from the eyeball
No
Ida takes the knife away, gets in Mike's face
Then you will give me my baby
My child, born in wedlock, saved from its sinner parents and raised to fear God and give him praise
Sheryl starts
Inappropriate, but nonetheless, She's cracking up
Has she finally cracked
That's why you married us
So we could conceive our child in wedlock
The fucking joke's on you
'm already pregnant

You're lying

Deacon turns, looks up
Sheryl, a fresh tear in her dress, holds the in one hand, the moonshine jar in the other
The Moonshine jar has a torn length of her dress sticking out, a homemade Molotov Cocktail
She glares down at Deacon, lights the cocktail
Burn in hell you sonofabitch
She drops it

Mike's a bloody mess, his life slips from him by the second
Sheryl  Mike's shirt,   from his stomach
She finds the wound, but has nothing to stop the blood
You did it, baby
You saved me
You said you would and you did

Well, if you love me
Fight

She looks around wildly, spying

Sheryl jumps up, races for the wardrobe
-- On a shelf are some towels, linens, etc
Sheryl grabs the towels, but as she does
She sees, on the floor of the wardrobe
Sheryl quickly rummages through her backpack
She finds

The fliers with the emergency contact info

She leans in, listens for breath sounds, feels for his pulse, finds one

Once inside, the Ambulance's doors close
Sheryl watches the Ambulance pull away
She places her hand on her stomach
