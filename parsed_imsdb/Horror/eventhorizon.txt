" " Screenplay by Philip Eisner - vast field of stars
The gas giant Neptune slowly spins into view
Brilliant and blue and cold against the void
- stands out against the planet, tiny against Neptune's scale
- to discern the hard angles of a man-made craft
ship
No longer dwarfed by the planet, the scale of the vessel emerges: a vast labyrinth of steel
Its shadow swallows all in darkness
: - Shafts of Neptune's blue light enter through windows, illuminate debris suspended in the zero-gravity environment: shards of metal and glass
from the Corridor into: - cockpit for three
Neptune's blue light fills the chamber, reflects off immobile particles in the air
Thick quartz windows look down at Neptune
The cockpit lights are dark but for one blinking red light
An emergency beacon
Under-floor lights go on
The strobe of the red light reveals a man floating at the helm, slowly spinning
He is dead, perfectly preserved in the cold vacuum of space
His eyes are empty black pits and his mouth hangs open in a scream:
: Weir opens his eyes, waking from dream
Sweat beads his ascetic, etched face
Many years a scientist
He turns on the bedside lamp, revealing a couple's apartment
Decorated by a woman, but Weir is alone, unless you count photographs
His nightstand looks like a shrine to a beautiful woman
Weir reaches to the stand
Picks up
, The woman appears thin and haggard and wears a small brave smile
Weir lies back on the bed
Looks at the photo
Presses it to his forehead and closes his eyes
Trying to be with her, just one more time
(whisper) miss you
- Weir stands in front of the bathroom mirror, shaving with a straight-razor
The mirror reveals the bathtub just behind him
, ,
Weir turns to stare at the bathtub
Water wells up at the mouth of the tub's faucet, grows impossibly large, falls
Weir turns back to his shaving
- Weir stands in the kitchenette, staring at the microwave as it cooks his breakfast
- Weir stands before his window, chewing his oatmeal mechanically, forcing himself to swallow
He reaches out to open the blinds
as the blinds pull aside, revealing Weir, upside-down
- Weir's window is just one of many in a space station, a delicate combination of cylindrical habitats and solar panels
The structure hangs above the Earth in low orbit

(
) This is Weir
(
) (tinny) Dr
Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible
: - military office, United States Aerospace Command seal blazoned on the door
Views of the Earth
Admiral sits behind his desk, a gruff career officer and a good man
Weir enters, escorted by Hollis' adjutant,
You wanted to see me, Admiral
apologize for the short notice, Bill, but we've had something come up that requires your immediate attention
Lyle
Lyle activates a holographic display of the solar system box magnifies the eighth planet, Neptune, revealing a flashing red dot in its orbit
At oh-three-hundred this morning, picked up an automated navigation beacon broadcasting at two minute intervals in Neptune orbit
Lyle hands Weir a stack of hardcopy data
Weir reads the data with growing excitement
Incredible
These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared
this, this happened
This isn't some kind of hoax
wouldn't bring you here on a hoax
Houston confirms the telemetry and codes
(excited) It's the Event Horizon
She's come back
Hollis answers drily
That ship was lost in deep space, seven years ago
If the Titanic sailed into New York harbor, 'd find it more plausible
(beat) Houston wants Aerospace to send out a search and rescue team, investigate the source of the transmission
If it really is the Event Horizon, they'll attempt a salvage
(beat) We need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship's systems for the salvage crew
written briefing can't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this
have to go with them
Lyle looks at Weir, stunned by the request
Dr
Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures
designed the ship's propulsion system
am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive
You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed
That would be like
like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle
can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr
Weir, but it doesn't factor into this
This is not about my reputation
This is not about me at all
(beat, passionate) The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light
Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds
Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew
We lost the dream
(beat, quiet and relentless) have to go
It's not that simple
(off of Weir's expression) Lyle, play the recording for Dr
Weir
Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel
This was the only response
Lyle presses a button on Hollis' desk
An unholy  rips from office speakers:  and  and
Alone, each sound would raise the hair on your neck
Together, they are unbearable
The sound mercifully cuts off to
Lyle stops the tape
Weir sits there, stunned
Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact
Just the beacon, every two minutes
The crew
Could they still be alive
The ship had life support systems for eighteen months
They're been gone seven years
Someone sent that message
Admiral, you have to put me on that ship
Hollis stares at Weir, judging the man with his eyes
It's against my better judgement, but 'll run this by the Man downstairs
You'll know my decision by the end of the day
Thank you
Don't thank me, Bill
'm not doing you any favors
Weir leaves
The door closes behind him
You're not seriously considering sending him
You don't just dismiss Bill Weir
The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton
If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss
That doesn't mean a damn thing
They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill
But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship
Does he know that
What's on your mind
He doesn't belong on this mission
Responsible or not, he blames himself
He's too close to it
(beat) And then there's his wife
It's been two years since she died
He's over it
Some things you don't get over
Beat
want our best people on this
Where's Miller
The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt, she's docked in bay four
: / The Lewis and Clark pulls away from Daylight station, turns towards the depths of space
It is a tough-looking spacecraft, all engine
Sequence omitted from original script
- on thick quartz windows near the ship's nose: the bridge
Split level
Above: avionics, navigation, flight control
(female, Navigator, sharp mind, sharp tongue) checks the navigation data on her screen as  (male, Pilot, wrapped too tight) punches in the course
can't believe this,  haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit
Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women
Smith's right
Neptune
There's nothing out there
If something happens, we'll be on our own
The captain's chair drops from above, swivels to reveal (male, Captain, intense)
don't like it either, but you know the rules: we get the call, we go
Is the course locked in
Locked and cocked
We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready
Justin
Below: the bridge's "war-room" -- ship's systems and mission stations
(male, Engineer, young hot-shot)
Everything green on my boards, Skipper
Start the countdown
Ion drive will engage in
-minus ten minutes
Let's go
Miller slides down a ladder into the war-room
The others follow into
- Bulky  (extra-vehicular activity) suits line the walls
blares from a , built into a storage locker
An Emergency Tech stows safety lines:  -- male, the resident pain-in-the-ass
He  along with the music
(not breaking stride) Kill it
Cooper reaches up, turns off the box
Time to play Spam in the can
Don't start with me, Cooper
Cooper falls in as the crew continues into
- Evidence of long term habitation
Personalized lockers
Fold- down bunks, chairs, tables; currently stowed for docking modular galley
(female, Emergency Technician, the crew's denmother) and  (male, Doctor, a cold perfectionist) load CO2 scrubbers into a bin in the floor
Weir stands to the side like a fifth wheel
Captain Miller,  just want to say
The clock is running, Dr
Weir
If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks
Weir hesitates, then follows the crew into Medical
Miller hangs back
What's the hold up
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers
(to Miller, accusatory) Good for four months
put in for a replacement for you but no one
No, no, its alright
talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and 'll get him this summer
(beat) Goddam it, Skipper
haven't seen him in two months
am sorry
But now we have to go to work
: - high tech operating room
Modular equipment
Vertical tanks line the walls, each large enough to hold a human being: gravity couches
The crew stands before the gravity couches, almost nude, no room for modesty
Starck catches Cooper looking at her ass as she strips to her undergarments
Cooper grins
She flips him off, not bothering to turn around
Is that an offer
It is not
Miller disrobes
Two service tags hang around his neck
He does not remove them
Weir approaches him
Captain Miller,  appreciate this opportunity
Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to
We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why
've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space
Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way
Weir nods, moves to an empty couch bearing his name, written on a piece of tape
Peters watches him
First time in a grav couch
Yes
She checks Weir's couch, helps him climb in
Weir keeps one eye on Miller
(Off of Weir's glance) Don't worry about it
He's hard, but he's fair
You're lucky to be shipping out with him
He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach
He's been past Mars
He served on the Goliath
Wasn't that ship destroyed
(nods) They attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for Titan
The shuttle's oh-two tanks ruptured during the rescue, flooded both ships with pure oxygen
There was a spark and both ships were incinerated
The Skipper and three others just made it to a lifeboat
Captain Miller was able
(interrupting) He doesn't like to talk about it
swathes one of Weir's arms with alcohol
You didn't eat anything in the past twelve hours
Weir shakes his head
When the Ion drive fires, we'll be taking about 30 gees
Without a tank, the force would liquefy your skeleton
injects Weir
The scientist winces
've seen the effect on mice
The overhead lights change to red
Five minutes
hands him the breathing mask
Put this on
Weir does
checks the fit
You'll be fine
You'll wake up and we'll be there
Watch your fingers
closes the tank
It begins to fill with green gel
Weir's eyes grow large with fear and then the anaesthesia hits
His eyes close
His body draws into a fetal position
(checking the monitor) Heart-rate decreasing
body temp dropping to 80
70
60
50
40 degrees Fahrenheit
He's in stasis
: - at the aft of the ship begins to glow a deep red
- The crew hang inert in the gravity couches
- The engine flares white hot
The Lewis and Clark lances forward
: -   - The Lewis and Clark races  past
The engine at its aft holds a sustained fusion reaction like the sun
:
Lewis and Clark
56 days out
- immobile in the grav tank
He might be sleeping
He might be dead
distant  echoes though the ship, the unholy garble of human and inhuman voices -- it is the Event Horizon, calling to him -- the sound refines into a ' , no more than a : Billy
Weir opens his eyes
'm so cold
Weir's grav tank opens
the seven bodies of the crew, suspended inert in the gel
sound:
Weir slowly walks to the Bridge
'm so cold
- naked  sits at the helm, her back to us
Completely still
Her skin is very pale
Water pools around her chair
Weir stands behind her
(tentative) Claire
She does not answer
She does not move
Weir reaches out to touch her shoulder, then pulls his hand back, afraid
Claire
'm sorry
Claire
He reaches out again
He touches her hair
She doesn't move
Weir catches her reflection in the computer monitors
Something wrong with her face
He starts to spin her around
'm so cold
: - Weir awakes with a jolt, in his grav couch
His mask has slipped
His tank has filled with blood
He is drowning
: - Reality
Weir's eyes open
He presses against the glass of the tank, trying to force it open, panicked
The others are already stepping from open tanks
Weir's tank opens with a
He tumbles to the floor, gasping, fluid streaming from his mouth
Peters rushes to him
(gasping) Claire
(to Weir) It's okay
You're okay
Just breathe
Weir catches his breath
He looks up
The crew surrounds him, concerned
'm alright now
'm alright
helps him to his feet
Move slowly
You've been in stasis for fifty-six days
You're going to experience a little disorientation
Weir nods
Damn, Dr
Weir, don't scare us like that
Coffee
What
Coffee
No, thank you
Cooper, still butt-naked and proud of it, grabs a metal cylinder from the wall and pours a mug for himself
Hey, Starck
You wanna dry my back
Starck gives him a cool once over
Maybe when you finish puberty
Miller zips up
Starck, why aren't you on the bridge
just finished drying
Then what are you doing here
Come on, people, let's go
(to Cooper) And Cooper
Put some pants on
: -    - The Lewis and Clark drifts towards Neptune
- The crew has secured the quarters from flight status
Bunks have been folded down, each alcove personalized with photographs and pin-ups
moves around the cabin, checking the crew's radiation badges
Cooper and Justin sit on their bunks, tossing a handball across the cabin
Peters holds a "Watchman" video unit, watching a "video letter"
-  (' ) from , her four-year-old son, a paraplegic, grinning widely in his new wheelchair: (video) Play horsey, Mommy, play horsey
, Peters enters shot, scoops her child from the chair
(video) Want to play horsey, do you
(etc
) - Weir sits huddled in a blanket
Miller takes a seat next to him
Starck and Smith enter
Starck sits next to Miller
30 hours to Neptune orbit
All boards are green, everything's five by five
That's good to know
Justin, you wanna stow that
Justin catches the ball, holds onto it
Okay, listen up
As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew
Dr
Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer -- You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that
This is Cooper, what the hell do you do on this ship, anyway
Ballast
(to Weir) am your best friend
am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker
He's a rescue technician
Peters, medical technician
Trauma
And this is mission specialist Dr
William Weir
We all know where we're going
Dr
Weir is going to tell us why
Miller and the crew look at Weir, waiting
Weir clears his throat
What  am about to tell you is considered code-black by the
The crew look at each other: they haven't heard that in a mission briefing before
That means top-secret, Cooper
heard it
The  intercepted a radio transmission from a decaying orbit around Neptune
The source has been identified as the Event Horizon
Then everyone talks at once: That's impossible
She was lost with all hands, what, seven
Seven years ago, the reactor blew
How can we salvage
Let the dead rest, man
cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission
Let the man speak
In the quiet that follows: What was made public about the Event Horizon, that she was a deep space research vessel, that its reactor went critical, that the ship blew up
None of that is true
(beat) The Event Horizon was the culmination of a secret government project to create a spacecraft capable of faster- than-light flight
The crew stares at Weir: he has just dropped another bomb on them
You can't do that
The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel
Relativity, yes
We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it
The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away
How
Well, in layman's terms, you use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons; these in turn fold space-time consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics until the space- time curvature becomes infinitely large and you have a singularity
Laymen's terms
Weir thinks of another way to explain it
He rips a pin-up from Smith's locker
Hey
Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from "point " here
(marks it on the photo with a pen) to "point ," here
(marks point ) Now: what's the shortest distance between two points
The crew stares at him
Starck decides to play
straight line
Wrong
The shortest distance between two points
Weir folds the paper, lining up point  over point
then his pen through both, skewering the pin-up
is zero
That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point  and point  coexist in the same space and time
After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal
(hands the ruined pin- up back to Smith) It's called a gravity drive
How do you know all this
built it
Even Cooper is impressed
can see why they sent you along
So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened
It was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive
The Event Horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters
They received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive
(beat) And the ship vanished from all our scopes
No radar contact, no enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind
They disappeared without a trace
(beat) Until now
Where has it been for the last seven years
That's what we're here to find out
: - The Lewis and Clark flashes silently past, heading deeper and deeper into space
- The crew assembled
We haven't been able to confirm any live contact, but  did receive a single transmission from the Event Horizon
Weir punches a button on a console
The transmission from the bridge's speakers,  and  and, underneath all,
The crew listen, look at one another
The recording ends abruptly
What the hell is that
It doesn't sound like anything human
Houston has passed the recording through several filters and isolated what appears to be a human voice
He activates a different file
The resulting  is more human but no less terrifying, a cry of despair
The last message from a drowning man
Jesus
What is that
It sounds like Latin
Latin
Who the fuck speaks Latin
No one
It's a dead language
Mostly dead
What does it say
encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message
Weir plays the   for a third time
There: "
liberatis me
" They haven't been able to translate the rest, it's too distorted
"Liberatis me
" "Save me
" From what
(to Weir) You're convinced the crew could still be alive
After seven years
The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months
It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission
have to think that someone has managed to endure until now
Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this
You heard the tape, Smith
We're looking for survivors
: -    - The Lewis and Clark closes in on the blue planet
- The flight crew assembled
Data flashes across the main monitors on the bridge
Crossing the horizon
Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees
Come around to three-three-four
(echoing) Heading three-three-four
(continuing) Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees
One-four degrees
-   - thrusters pivot and fire as the ship enters Neptune orbit, dropping lower and lower into the dense blue clouds
- The ship begins to rock as it encounters atmosphere, a growing vibration
flash across the main window's
Neptune's dark shadow fills the screen
We have a lock on the Event Horizon's navigation beacon
It's in the upper ionosphere, we're in for some chop
Bring us in tight
Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening
(into radio) This is
Aerospace Command vessel Lewis and Clark, hailing Event Horizon, Event Horizon, do you read
This is the Lewis and Clark, hailing
(she continues
) (over Starck) Matching speed
now
Range to target ten thousand meters and closing
Skipper,  got a bad feeling about this
We're all on edge, Smith
We're a long way out
That's not it
That ship was built to go faster than light
That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know
What are you trying to say
"If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings
" Something like that, yeah
Miller grins grimly
guess we're about to find out
Keep us slow and steady
Yes, sir
Dr
Weir
Weir sticks his head into the bridge
think you want to see this
Weir climbs up the ladder to the flight deck
Where is she
Dead ahead, 5000 meters
Suddenly, the ship
Weir braces himself in the doorway, staring out the forward window into the roiling azure clouds
Smith grimaces, his knuckles white at the controls
We've got some weather
noticed
Starck, anybody home
If they are, they're screening their calls
Range 3000 meters and closing
can't see anything
Only turbid clouds of methane ice whirl past the Lewis and Clark's windows
1500 meters
We're getting too close
Where is it
(checking her console) The scope is lit, it's right in front of us
1000 meters
red warning light begins to flash in time with a shrill Proximity warning
900, 800 meters, 700
we're right on top of it, we're gonna hit
Starck
It should be right there
She looks up, trails off
My God
-   -  ' the clouds break, revealing
, right in front of them
black labyrinthine blasphemy against Neptune's arctic blue
Cloud banks encircle the ship as if it were the eye of a hurricane
- Reverse thrusters full
-     - The Event Horizon looms enormous as the Lewis and Clark hangs off the port stern, dwarfed by the giant ship
- The turbulence subsides
The bridge crew stares at the massive craft
The only sound, the
Finally: Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker
She's not ugly
Miller reaches over Smith's shoulder, turns off the proximity warning
Smith snaps back to business
Range 500 meters and holding
Turbulence is dropping off
Picking up magnetic interference
Put it through
Smith, you up for a flyby
(he is not) Love to
-    -   - The Lewis and Clark maneuvers in close to the Event Horizon, dwarfed by the dark ship
- Smith keeps a tight hand on the controls
The crew stare out the viewport at the abandoned craft
Look at the size of that thing
Weir explains the view out the cockpit window
Foredecks
Crew quarters, bridge, medical and science labs, hydroponics, what have you
That central section connects the forward decks to the Engineering containment area
Can we move in closer
Shit, Doc, any closer and we're gonna need a rubber
Do it
Smith grimaces
His hands move carefully over the controls
-    -   - The Lewis and Clark moves even closer
Vanishing into the shadow of the Event Horizon
- The crew stares at the ship rushing past the viewport huge spherical structure looms eerily ahead
That's the engineering containment
And there's the main airlock
We can dock there
Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster
Be careful
It's not a load bearing structure
-    - The Lewis and Clark carefully maneuvers in close to the Event Horizon's airlock
mechanical boom-arm extends from the smaller ship to latch onto the Event Horizon
Its clawed hand grabs the antennae cluster
The cluster buckles under the stress
- (to Weir) It is now
(to Miller) We're locked in
Starck, give me a read
scan of the Event Horizon appears across Starck's screen
The reactor's still hot
We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably
Nothing serious
Do they have pressure
Affirmative
The hull's intact
but there's no gravity and the thermal units are off line
'm showing deep cold
The crew couldn't survive unless they were in stasis
Find 'em, Starck
Starck frowns at her display
Something's wrong with the bio-scan
Radiation interference
There's not enough radiation to throw off the scan
'm picking up trace life forms, but  can't get a lock on the location
Could it be the crew
If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan
If they were in stasis, 'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship
It doesn't make any sense
Okay
We do it the hard way
Deck by deck, room by room
Starck, deploy the umbilicus
believe you're up for a walk, Mr
Justin
Go get your bonnet on
Yes, sir
Weir starts to follow Justin from the bridge
Dr
Weir,  need you on the bridge
Captain,  didn't come out here to sit on your bridge,  need to be on that ship
Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board -- (interrupting) That is not acceptable -- (overlapping) -- once we've secured the ship, that's the way it is
(beat) need you to guide us from the comm station
This is where  need you
Help us to do our job
Weir exhales
Very well
: -   - The docking collar umbilicus extends to the Event Horizon's airlock
- Miller, Peters, Justin and Cooper in ; Cooper and Justin, without headgear
come on, Skipper,  already put my shoes on
(muffled) You've had plenty , Coop, it's Justin's turn
Stay on station
If anything happens
'll be all over it
Miller nods to Peters
(muffled) Opening inner airlock door
The inner airlock door opens: -
Miller, Peters and Justin enter the airlock
Justin attaches his safety line
Miller and Peters do not
You still need the rope
thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins
'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it
Now step aside, old man
Cooper puts Justin's helmet on
It seals tight
(serious now) You just keep your nose clean, Baby Bear
Clear the door
Cooper backs out, allowing the inner airlock door to shut, through the ship
- Miller, Peters and Justin float down the brightly lit umbilicus into the Event Horizon, all in  suits
Justin's safety line trails out behind him
The    of the Event Horizon waits for them
- Weir has taken over Justin's station
He watches the monitors like a kid watching Christmas
Smith and Starck keep tabs over his shoulder
You've reached the outer airlock door
- Peters attaches a thumper -- a device using sound waves to measure pressure -- to the inner airlock door
We've got pressure
Clear and open on my mark
Three
two
one
mark
Peters inserts a zero- drill into the panel beside the door
The door slowly opens
: -    - The immense corridor stretches away into darkness in both directions
Distantly spaced windows manifest as remote pools of blue light amidst endless black, adding to the vast sense of scale
The light from their dual spotlights on the team's helmets reflects off tiny ice crystals of frozen atmosphere
They are ants in a tomb built for giants
Jesus its huge
Ice crystals everywhere
This place is a deep freeze
(
) (radio) You're in the central corridor
It connects the personnel areas to Engineering
Peters and  will search the forward decks
Justin, take Engineering
No hot-dogging, not on this one, alright
Not a chance, sir
-    - The group separates
Justin kicks off from the wall, shoots down the corridor at immense speed
-    - Miller and Peters move in the opposite direction
They use magnetic plates on their boots and gloves to cling to the walls as they slowly make their way down the dark shaft
Their journey seems endless
The darkness almost seems a living thing as it surrounds them
-    - Miller spots something at a coupling, where two sections of the corridor join
Dr
Weir, what's this
Miller indicates a box nestled against the coupling
The universal symbol for explosives is on the cover
(ahead at the next coupling) Here's another one
They're all over the place
(
) (radio) They're explosive charges
can see that, what're they for
- In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship
That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat
-    - Peters and Miller keep moving
That means they didn't abandon ship
So where are they
Starck, any luck with the bio-scan
- 'm running diagnostics now, Skipper
Nothing's wrong with the sensor pack, 'm still getting trace life readings, all over the ship
-    - Miller and Peters unconsciously look around
Sweat beads their faces
There's no one in the corridor but us
(
) (radio) Not according to the computer
Peters is right, no one's here
don't know, this place is really dark,  can't see a thing
She starts to wave her searchlight around wildly
(calming her down) Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay
Let's finish the sweep
(
) (radio) Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead
can see the hatch
Starck, you still showing those readings
(
) (radio) That's an affirmative
(to Peters) Keep your eyes open
She nods as he reaches for the hatch
- The hatch opens, allowing Peters and Miller entrance into the forward decks
These areas were intended for human habitation, and seem similar in design to the Lewis and Clark, only larger
Gravity couches line both walls, eighteen in all
Empty
We found the gravity couches
- Weir peers eagerly at the monitors
Any survivors
(
) (radio) Negative
Hope drains from Weir's face
No one
- They're empty, Dr
Weir
Moving forward
Miller and Peters split up, each taking a separate exit from the chamber
- Weir looks at Justin's  screen: a grainy image of the First Containment Seal
-    (  ) Justin stands before a thick pressure door
Justin checks the door with his thumper, his boots are now on
(
) (radio) You've reached the First Containment Seal
The engineering decks are on the other side
We still have pressure
The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour
(
) (radio) Background radiation
Perfectly safe
Justin touches a panel beside the door
It opens
He enters
- a long corridor shaped like a tube
It rotates like a turbine, causing vertigo
Justin's  echoes in his helmet as he moves forward
- Cooper stares at Justin's safety line in the airlock
counts off silently, passing 150 meters
- The corridor ends at a pressure door
Dr
Weir, what's this the door to
(
) (radio) You're at the Bridge, Ms
Peters
You still haven't seen any crew
- / Miller, moving through a deserted lab
Empty operating tables
Stainless steel surgical instruments float in zero-
glove floats up behind him, brushes his shoulder
He wheels
the glove is empty
It spins away
If we saw any crew, Doctor, you'd know about it
(looking around) 'm in Medical
No casualties, it looks like this place has never been used
He finds a computer console
- Peters opens the door
- Peters enters
Looks around: a small antechamber for crew briefings, with chairs and a display table
Red crystals float in a crimson mist around her
found something
- Weir peers at the monitors, trying to make out the red haze
Yes, we can see some kind of mist
What is that
(
) (radio) Blood
Looks like arterial spray
(nervous) Can you see a body
- (confused) There's no one here
(
) (radio) The blood came from somewhere, Peters
There's no one here, Skipper
Peters takes a sample container from her belt
Carefully tries to capture a suspended crystal
Come on
and the Container; Peters' brow furrowed with concentration
, , Someone died here in a violent and terrible way
Peters starts to look up but the flash dies away
She never saw the horror behind her
Peters turns her attention back to her tiny crystal
She traps the it, returns the container to her belt
She moves from the antechamber into
- Her helmet lights sweep the room
Every surface a control panel
Okay
'm on the bridge
(
) (radio) What you got, Peters
Peters examines the other consoles -- most are dark but for a few dim lights
Everything's been shut down
Conserving power,  guess
Green light on the hull, it's intact
- / The science workstation has power, 'll see if  can find the crew from here
- Weir stares at Peters' monitor
Ms
Peters, turn back and to your left, please
On her monitor, Peters'  shifts as she complies
What is it
Ship's log
(
) (radio) see it
- Peters reaches towards a small video deck
Touches the eject button
Nothing happens
It's stuck
- Justin's light bounces off an even larger pressure door, built like a bank vault
The Second Seal
've reached another containment door
This thing's huge
(
) (radio) That's the Second Containment Seal
Beyond that, engineering
'm going in
Justin opens the seal
It releases , inching open
Justin squeezes through
- Peters takes a small probe from her belt, inserts it into the video deck
small laser disc emerges partway from the deck
Peters pulls on it
It doesn't move
It's really jammed in there
shadow crosses the window behind her
Someone -- something -- is in there with her
Peters pulls harder
Nothing
Another effort
The disc pulls free
Peters spins in the zero-gravity, spinning into
floating at the helm, the face illuminated by Peters' helmet lights
His swollen tongue clogs his gaping, screaming mouth
His cracked and crystallized skin is crossed by a network of bloated veins
He has no eyes
Just like Weir's dream
- Peters' monitor shows the ' face, its mouth open in mute agony
Weir
- Peters pushes free of the body
(professional) found one
(
) (radio) Alive
Frozen
- The dead man's face leers from Peters' monitor
What happened to his eyes
Explosive decompression
Decompression wouldn't do that
Weir just stares at the ruined face, rapt
Starck notices
You okay
Weir nods, not taking his eyes from the screen
- Cooper, on station
He keys his radio
Hey, Baby Bear, Mama Bear got a corpsicle for ya
No reply
- / Miller looks up from the workstation, concerned
(
) (radio) Baby Bear, you copy
- Cooper stares out at Justin's safety line slowly counting off past 175 meters
Justin, do you copy
- The Second Seal is open
Justin's safety line snakes into darkness
the safety line into the dark
- An alcove, opening into a vast chamber
Once pristine, all the surfaces have been coated in a dark gray slick
Globules of fluid hang motionless, sticking to Justin's suit, leeching away his light and swallowing him in darkness
(
) (radio) do you copy
(quiet) Uh, yeah Coop, 'm still here
(
) (radio) Shit
Do not do that
Where the fuck are you
'm in the Second Containment area
It's pitch black in here
There must have been a coolant leak
Man, this shit is everywhere
can't see a damn thing
lighted console blocks Justin's view of the chamber beyond
He drifts over to it, wipes the console clear of coolant, revealing dim lights: the station has power
The reactor's still hot
Coolant level is on reserve, but still in the green
' (triumph) got it
His expressions changes as he looks past the console and sees
something
(trailing off in awe) Holy shit
Justin
think  found something
'  - massive sphere, 10 meters in diameter, dominates the center of the second containment
Intricate machinery surrounds the sphere but the globe itself is featureless, smooth; a enigmatic monolith
Black ice encrusts it, giving it the seeming of a living thing
- They stare at Justin's monitor
What the hell is that
That's the Core: the gravity drive
The heart of the ship
- (
) (radio) Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks
Peters
- (
) (radio) how's the client
Crystallized
- Justin examines the outer wall of the Core, looking for any cracks or ruptured seams
(
) (radio) Justin, finish your sweep
Almost done,  just gotta check one thing
Justin turns to the Core
- Justin's monitor fills with static
Justin, hold on a sec, you're breaking up
- (
) (radio) Justin
(static obscure her voice) Justin reaches towards the Core with his pressure sensor
His helmet light flickers
He hesitates
- / Miller's helmet light flickers
- Peter's helmet light winks out
- Justin, come in
Suddenly, the bio-scan lights up, from green to red as signals race across the display
What is it
don't know
The life readings just went off the scale
Something's wrong
- Justin places the pressure sensor against the Core
Touching it
The Core turns deepest black
darkness that light cannot penetrate
For a second, Justin's white suit is captured against the hungry void
-   () - Cooper stares in shock as Justin's safety line as it reels out at an incredible rate -- 250 meters, 300 meters
- surges out of the Core, bending light like a ripple on a pond, pushing coolant and debris before it
-    - The gravity wave surges forward, blowing out emergency lights as it comes, flotsam and jetsam swirling in its wake
- / Data floods Miller's workstation, flashing across the screen too fast for comprehension
--
- / What the hell
fills the ship
Miller rises to investigate
The door   as   , ripples through the Medical Bay towards Miller
Oh shit
Debris swirls around him
the wave sweeps him up him into a bulkhead
-  ' the briefest suggestion of a  , obscured by and  before the screen  to static entirely
The rest of the crew's  screens go dead as
the wave hits them, threatening to tear the Lewis and Clark apart
The ship shudders violently
Consoles with sparks
Weir and the others hold on for dear life
Miller, do you read me, Peters -- Get them back -- 'm trying, goddammit -- An equipment rack
Smith grabs an extinguisher, fights the blaze
- Cooper and , bracing against the bulkhead
Cooper hits the intercom
What's happening
(
) (intercom) don't know, the screens are dead
Cooper peers out the airlock window
' passes 350 meters and accelerating
350 meters
400 meters
He's in trouble
Go
'm gone
Cooper grabs his helmet
helps him lock the helmet into place with a
The inner airlock door opens
As Cooper enters the airlock, Justin's safety reel stops, the line jerking taut at 500 meters
- / Miller tries to get his bearings in the dark
Boarding party, sound off
Peters, do you read me
Peters
- Peters' light, too, remains dark, but Neptune's blue light fills the Bridge
The frozen corpse floats before her
No longer a man
young boy, maybe five years old
His legs are withered, useless things
The skin remains a crystallized surface, but the eyes look straight at her, alive
Denny
Peters reaches out to touch the body
It falls away from her
No longer her son, but the body of the astronaut
It hits the door and shatters
- / (growing desperation) Peters, do you read me
' , in agony,  over Miller's radio: (radio) Don't leave me
Justin
Justin, sound off
Justin
Miller trails off as   flickers across his visor
He turns
- / ( ) stands in Medical/Science, a human body wreathed in flame
The eyes are like sunspots
As the Burning Man moves, bones and black flesh poke through the fire
He raises one hand to point at Miller in accusation
- / Miller's  stops in his throat
His mouth works but nothing comes out
He
and the  is gone
Miller is alone,  hard
- Cooper enters at full speed, shooting through in a controlled fall
Hold on, Baby Bear
- into the Second Containment
He catches himself at the console
Cooper sees Justin's safety line, cut off abruptly by the darkness of the Core
Oh my God
The darkness of the Core ripples
Justin suddenly emerges from the darkness, a white figure riding a wave of impenetrable blackness
Cooper catches him, holds him tight as the wave carries them towards the wall
Cooper sees a control rod -- a long metal spike -- coming at them
He twists his body so that they miss -- barely -- before slamming into the wall
Justin, do you read me
Justin
Cooper pulls Justin close
Justin's head lolls to one side
Unconscious
Baby Bear, don't do this
Don't do this
- Weir, Starck and Smith continue to hold on tightly as the vibration builds
and builds
Here comes another one
Hold on
The second wave hits
Sparks fly as consoles
Deep in the ship metal , followed by the  of escaping atmosphere
An emergency klaxon  out:
Starck checks Justin's station: We lost the starboard baffle
The hull's been breached
The Bridge pressure door begins to close
and then stop
The safety circuit's failed
We're losing atmosphere
There are pressure suits in the Airlock
Go
Starck pushes Weir ahead of her, Smith follows hard as they run the length of the ship for the airlock bay
- / The vibration subsides
Can anybody hear me
(
) (radio) Skipper
Peters
- (
) (radio) you okay
Yeah
'm -- 'm okay
Her voice cracks as she says it
She looks anything but
- / The reports come, one on the other
(
) (radio) We have a man down
Coop, where are you
(
) (radio) The containment, Second Containment
Hold on, Coop
(
) (radio) Captain Miller
Smith, where the hell have you been
We have a situation here
- Starck and Smith already in suits
assists Weir
Smith has already locked his helmet into place
(continuing) We lost the starboard baffle and the hull cracked
Our safety seals didn't close, the circuit's fried -- - / Miller moves down the central corridor towards his wounded ship
Do we have enough time for a weld
(
) (radio) We don't have time to fart
- We're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked
In three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone
We are fucking dead
- / No one's dying on my watch, Smith
What about the reserve tanks
(
) (radio) They're gone
Beat
Miller closes his eyes, desperately trying to think of a solution
- across the faces of the astronauts
No hope
Except for Weir: The Event Horizon
The others turn to stare at Weir
What
It still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support
What if the air has gone bad
We can't wear these suits forever
don't think this is a good idea, we don't even know what happened on that ship
It beats dying, Mister Smith
- / Dr
Weir's right
Get on board the Event Horizon
'll meet you at the airlock
(
) (radio) But
You heard me, Smith
Peters, are you with me
- Peters at the life support console
'm ahead of you
Bringing the thermal units on line
Peters flips a series of circuit-breakers
Reaches for the final switch
Hold tight and prep for gees
Everything floating in the bridge  to the floor
- Justin and Cooper collapse to the deck, coolant splashing down all around them
: -    - Miller meets the crew as they evacuate the Lewis and Clark
Weir leads the way, eager; Smith hangs back
Everybody okay
We're all here
Okay
Let's find out how much time we just bought
Miller reaches for the catch on his own helmet
We haven't tested the air yet
It could be contaminated
No time
We need whatever's left in our suits to repair the Clark
Like it or not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers
Miller pulls his helmet off with a
He breathes deep
Starck does the same, coughs
It tastes bad
But you can breathe it
: -    - The Lewis and Clark and the Event Horizon, locked together in Neptune orbit
Lights shine from the Horizon as power is restored
No longer cloaked in darkness, it is revealed in all its hideous glory, a nightmare etched in steel
- Weir moves from station to station, restoring power to each
Starck sits at the communications workstation
Miller watches over her shoulder
The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain
No one's going to be coming to help us
How much oh-two do we have
Oxygen is not the problem
Carbon dioxide
(nods) It's building up with every breath we take
And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot
We can take the filters from the Clark
thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours
After that, we'd better be on our way home
What about the life readings you picked up
The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate origin
" Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels
What's causing the readings
don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew
So where is the rest of the crew
We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood
Dr
Weir
Any suggestions
Weir just stares at the bloodstained wall
What happened here
Miller follows Weir's gaze to the wall: a Rorschach test in blood
: - from the bridge windows
-    - the Event Horizon in all its horrific glory, hanging skew in the center of the hurricane like a mote in God's eye
The Lewis and Clark clings to the giant craft, as insignificant as a tick
An even smaller figure clings to the hull of the Lewis and Clark
- It's Smith,  in full protective gear
His magnetic boots hold him to the Lewis and Clark's hull
He kneels over a hole in the hull, where the metal has buckled and torn
Vapor still leaks from the hole into space
Captain Miller, you copy
(
) (radio) 'm here, Smith, how's the Clark
've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull
We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time
(
) (radio) We don't have time, Smith
In twenty hours we run out of air
Understood
Smith uses a foam applicator to fill the hole
The gel freezes in place
Smith reaches to his belt, pulls out a - Presses it to the patch and begins to rivet it into place
: - / Justin lies unmoving on a table
His eyes are open, staring at a smear of blood on the ceiling
needle slides into the skin below his eye
He doesn't respond
removes the needle
It glistens with blood
He looks up at Miller and Peters
How is he
His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli
He might wake up in fifteen minutes
He might not wake up at all
What happened to him
shakes his head
Miller eyes the bloodstain above them
, take samples from these stains, compare them to medical records, want to know whose blood this is
: - Gravity has scattered debris and freeze-dried blood about the room
The crew (Justin and Smith excepted) tries to relax on the chairs of dead men
Their faces are wan and haggard
Weir relaxes at the table
Unlike the others, he seems almost at ease
remains forever stoic; Starck, animated and nervous
Cooper bounces the handball on the floor, a reflex action
Miller stares at a video monitor, watching Smith repair the Lewis and Clark
He turns from the window
Okay, people, there's been a change in the mission
In less than eighteen hours, we will run out of breathable air
Our primary objective is now survival
That means we focus on repairing the Lewis and Clark and salvaging whatever will buy us more time
(pause) Our secondary objective is finding out what happened to this ship and its crew
Two months from now, fully intend to be standing in front of the good Admiral giving my report, and 'd like to have more than my dick in my hands
Grim smiles all around
Peters,  want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers
can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin
Fine
Starck,  want you to repeat the bio-scan
What's the point
'll just get the same thing
Not acceptable
want to know what's causing those readings
If the crew is dead,  want the bodies,  want the crew found
can reconfigure the scan for -12, amylase proteins
Do it
Dr
Weir
Yes
One of my men is down
want to know what happened to him
told you
He was inside the Core
Weir starts shaking his head
It was like
nothing was there
and then Justin appeared and the Core
became metal
(cutting him off) No, he didn't
You weren't there
saw it
Saw what, Mr
Cooper
What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible
Cooper throws the ball at him, hard
Weir ducks
It bounces wildly around the room
Miller catches it
Cooper
Enough
Cooper sits down
(turning on Weir) Dr
Weir, Justin may die
Whatever happened to him could happen to all of us
Beat
don't know what happened to Justin
'm telling you,  saw it
What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion
(turning on Weir) know what  saw and it wasn't a fucking "optical effect
" Hold on, what's this "gravitational distortion
" It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time
They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark
What could cause them
(Weir doesn't answer) What's in the Core
It's complicated
How much time do you need
We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes
Now: what is in the Core
Beat
Here comes another bomb
black hole
The crew stares at him, stunned
: - Miller, Starck and Weir stand before the Core
Dark ominous structures loom around them, glistening with coolant
The of the ship is loud here, a deep  that steals their breath
Weir's voice is a reverent : That's how the gravity drive works, you see: it focuses the black hole's immense gravitational power to create the gateway
That's how the Event Horizon travels faster than light
can't believe we built this
It's insane
"Insane
" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship
It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star
The Event Horizon could be there in a day
If it worked
If it worked, yes
-   - 3RD They stare at the Core, the surrounding machinery moving in a slow giant's dance
trick of the eye, or does the Core stare back at them
- want this room sealed
The Second Containment is off limits
There's no danger
The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control
Your black hole damn near ripped my ship apart
It may have killed one of my men
(beat) No one goes near that thing
until its darkness fills the screen
: - / Peters sits before the computer workstation, running the ship's log, forwarding through hours of boring footage
Rubs her eyes
The lights flicker
Peters hears something  behind her
She turns
Justin
Justin lies unmoving on the nearest examination table
Comatose
Peters reaches out and picks up a scalpel
Peters hears the sound again,
She moves past Justin
past several empty tables, covered with clear plastic
to the last table
She stares in shock
' She slowly reaches out
Lifts the cover
Her son  looks at her and
She
The scalpel drops to the floor at her feet
Denny reaches up to her, to be picked up
Mommy
but the plastic that still covers his withered legs squirms like a bag full of snakes
Peters drops the plastic and backs away
(
) Peters
She turns
stands in the doorway, holding blood samples
Peters turns back, but her son is gone
reads her expression
What's wrong
Nothing
It's nothing

Takes off his helmet
You been out there a long time
Trying to break my record
'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can
This ship is bad
It watches you
What
You heard me
This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel
Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me
You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you
It fell down
You're sucking too much nitrogen in your mix
: - Starck programs the sensor workstation
She glances over at Weir: sitting at a computer terminal, his face rapt as data flashes by
His lips move, muttering to himself
Why Dr
Weir,  think you're in love
Hmmm
Claire used to tell me  loved the Event Horizon more than  loved her
told her that wasn't true, just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all
Claire is your wife
Yes
It must be hard, being so far away from her
Yes
miss her
She died
Two years now
'm sorry
Weir keeps his attention focused on the screen
These things happen
(reacting to something on the screen) Wait a minute, that's not right
He fingers fly across the keyboard, double-checking the data
Miller leans over Weir's shoulder
You have something, Dr
Weir
The date
What about it
The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034
It's 2041
Exactly
The ship's internal clock is off by seven years
Maybe a power interruption crashed the system
No, there's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind
It's as if time just
stopped for seven years
Explanation
Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible
(beat) Black holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened
(he shakes his head) The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like Lazarus, returned from the dead
The  interrupts them: (

followed by an inhuman  of , like screaming hyaenas, almost alive
Through the swirl of static, the suggestion of movement
Miller freezes the frame
He squints at the screen
Obscured by static, the image is blurred beyond comprehension
What the hell is that
Dr
Weir
don't know
can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up
Do it
Suddenly, the lights fade out
Dim emergency lighting snaps on
What's happening
power drain -- We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it
The Core
Weir heads for the door
Wait
But Weir has vanished into the corridor
The rest of you, stay here,  don't want anyone else going near that thing
Miller follows after Weir
: - The Second Containment Seal opens
Weir is about to enter when Miller stops him
He checks a Geiger counter
It is silent
No radiation
What's causing the drain
Weir crosses to a console
Frowns
(shakes his head) The magnetic fields are holding
Maybe a short in the fail-safe circuit
'll check it out
Miller assists Weir in removing bolts from an access panel
The panel falls away, revealing a cramped duct leading into the ship's circuitry
Weir climbs into the duct
Miller hands him a flashlight and a toolkit
We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad
Check the Core for radiation
Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries
Weir begins to crawl into the depths of the ship
- ' Weir's breath  in the cramped shaft
He counts off circuit panels as he goes: -three
-five
-seven
where are you
- Miller slogs through the coolant to the Core
Stares at it
It remains metallic, mundane
He pulls out a Geiger counter and crosses to the reactor shell
Examines a gleaming weld
The Geiger counter slowly: no leak
- yellow light starts flashing on the engineering board
Starck's eyes widen: the engineering sections flash yellow
and green
What the hell
' as the bio-scan goes wild
(into intercom) Skipper, the bio-scan just went off the scale
- / Justin shakes on the bed in an epileptic fit
rushes to him
Justin
Can you hear me
Justin
Justin's eyes remain unfocused, unseeing as he tries to speak
leans in close, trying to hear him speak
Justin arches in agony and the words come in a strangled, tortured voice: - ' Weir stops before module -12
Hears a faint  and There you are
He uses a screwdriver to open up the module
Reveals a series of circuit boards
One
Weir plucks the damaged chips and starts running a by-pass
His flashlight flickers
He bangs it against the duct wall
It grows dimmer
Goes out
Um
Captain Miller
, uh,  seem to have a problem with my light
single  of water in the darkness
(beat, hushed) Captain Miller
Another , then a woman's  like a distant echo: Billy
Weir starts at the sound
He recognizes the voice
She speaks again, no longer far away, but a close  in his ear: (
) Billy
Help me
'm so cold
Weir's eyes open wide in hope and fear
- Even the emergency lights go out
Total darkness
We just lost all power in here
Dr
Weir
Miller's voice trails off as he looks towards the Core red glow reflects across his eyes
He takes a few steps away from the reactor
He stares
at the  , standing before the Core
The deep of its conflagration fills the containment
It slowly turns and raises its arm and points at Miller in accusation
Don't leave me
Miller stares as the Burning Man turns and vanishes into a bulkhead, leaving the wall blackened and burned with his passing
- ' Total darkness
Weir's breath  in the cramped metal space
(a whisper) Claire
Weir bangs his flashlight
Again
Again
(
) Help me
'm so cold
The flashlight flickers
Claire's face is inches from Weir's
So cold
His flashlight flickers again, snaps on
She is gone
Weir lets his head fall to the floor of the deck, breathing in ragged
: - The crew, except for Cooper
whets a scalpel against the leg of his jumpsuit, an unconscious gesture
Carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations, impaired judgement
Goddammit, , it was not a hallucination
saw a man, he was on fire
And then he disappeared
Maybe one of the original crew
No
It was someone else
Who
(ignoring the question) Dr
Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something
No
saw nothing
did
All heads turn to her
About an hour ago
In medical
saw my son
He was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were
(she trails off) Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge
've seen bodies before
This is different
She falls silent, unwilling to say more
Peters is right
Its like something reaching into your mind
Seeing your thoughts and making them real
Smith, did you or Cooper experience anything unusual
Smith, leaning against the doorway: didn't see anything and  don't have to see anything
This ship is fucked
Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith
(exploding) Hey
You don't need to be a scientist figure it out
Smith
Weir's face is stone
you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price
You already killed the first crew
That's enough
lays one hand on Smith's shoulder to calm him
Smith reacts violently, turning on , shoving him back uses Smith's momentum to spin the pilot into the wall
He presses his scalpel just below Smith's ear
freezes
The scalpel falls from his hands
He releases Smith
'm sorry,
don't know why did that
(wry) Carbon dioxide
Smith goes for Weir
He's fucking lying, you know something
Miller heads him off, grabs him
That's it, that's enough for one day, Smith
need you back on the Clark,  need you calm,  need you using your head, you make a mistake out there, none of are getting home, you understand
Smith calms
Sir
Get outside, go back to work
'll join you shortly
Smith leaves
We're a long way from home and we're in a bad place
Let's not make it worse
If anyone has any constructive suggestions, now is the time
think  can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain
Do it
To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity
Anyone who can should get some sleep
don't need sleep,
need answers
Miller exits
Starck follows

The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin
(simultaneous) "
bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me
've got a theory
Miller stops
Go ahead
There was a another surge in the bio- readings right before you
you saw what you saw
We picked up a similar readings right before the Clarke was damaged
What if there were a connection between the two
The gravity waves, the hallucination, all part of an defensive reaction, like an immune system
Miller starts walking again
don't need to hear this
She rushes to follow
-
2 Miller and Starck enter the Airlock Bay: You've got to listen
To what
What are you saying
This ship is alive
didn't say that,  said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us
We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories
She grabs him by the arm
It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports
Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds
It's impossible
know that
Beat
Miller allows himself to relax
If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time
thought you wanted an answer
And that's the only one  have
Miller pulls an  suit from the wall, starts putting it on
What  want is to survive the next ten hours
(checks her watch) Nine hours and twenty-two minutes
'm going outside to work on the Clark
And Starck
don't tell anyone what you just told me
We've got enough to worry about
She nods
He locks his helmet into place
: - Establish
- The ship seems to breathe
The lights flicker
-    - The ship seems to breathe
The lights flicker
-    - The ship seems to breathe
The lights flicker
- / Peters has fallen asleep in her chair
On the threshold of hearing, a distant
Not a heartbeat
Metal on metal
Something trying to get out
Something trying to get in
Peters wakes with a start
Justin
She turns
Justin lies on the floor in a heap, completely covered by his sheet
She crosses to him
Pulls back the sheet
Revealing empty nitrogen tanks
Justin
She looks up, eyes widening, as
The  bottles fill with blood
Blood fills the -ray lightboxes, it surges up from gutters in the floor
And the pounding grows louder
almost to Medical
The spell breaks and she
- Peters sprints, the   after her, almost on her heels
- Peters darts into the Bridge Antechamber
She  the pressure door shut behind her,   the sound
She turns
Weir, , Starck look up from their work, staring at her
What's wrong
You didn't hear it
You must have heard it
Heard what
Beat
Peters starts to , part hysteria, part relief
Oh
nothing
crosses to Peters, concerned
Sit down
As he reaches out to touch her
Peters
clutches her to him, backs away from the door
The  grows louder
The door vibrates with each blow Starck puts her hands over her ears
Peters at the door
Stop it
Stop it
But the  intensifies, metal  under incredible pressure
(shouting to be heard) What is it
Weir slowly walks to the door
What are you doing
It wants me
have to go
He reaches for the door
No
Starck grabs him
He tries to shake her off, but she traps his arm in a wrist-lock
He turns on her, his face furious
and the  stops
They remain frozen for a moment
Afraid to breathe
Weir shakes the trance
In our current environment, Dr
Weir, self-control is an asset
'm alright
Please
In the distance, the  begins again
Moving away from them
The ship systems station
warning light flashes on the console
What is it
The forward airlock
(into radio) Miller, Smith, Cooper, any of you in the airlock
(
) (radio) That's a negative, Starck
(realization) Justin
Peters, Starck and  rush from the Bridge, leaving Weir behind
-
2 - Peters leads Starck and  down the corridor towards the Forward Airlock bay
They round a corner in time to see a figure moving in the Airlock
-
3 They race into the bay even as Justin steps into the Airlock
He is naked
Justin, no
-
3 Justin turns and stares through them with cold eyes
He reaches out to the airlock control
The pressure door shuts with a
: - Miller, Smith and Cooper cling to the Lewis and Clark's hull
They carefully remove an access panel, revealing scorched wiring
We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the
What about the accumulator
Starck's  breaks in: (
) (radio) Miller, come in
What's going on in there, Starck
(
) (radio) Justin's in the airlock
-
3 Starck at the intercom
The others huddle by the door
(
) (intercom) What
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit
- (to Cooper) Stay here
Don't stop working
But Justin
'll get him
Miller swings his body around, heads across the umbilicus to the Event Horizon
He moves in great leaps, using the magnetic plates in his gloves and boots to keep from drifting off into Neptune's thin atmosphere
: -
3 Starck works the airlock control panel without success
He's engaged the override
Can you shut it down
She opens the Airlock access panel
'll try
, you better get your bag of tricks
nods, runs off
Peters bangs on the Airlock door
Justin
Open the door
-
3 Peters' voice barely penetrates the pressure door: (muffled) Open the door
Justin turns off the artificial gravity
He begins to float gently
: - (' ) Miller moves like a frantic spider across the surface of the Event Horizon
'm on my way, Starck
(
) (radio) You better hurry
He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door
Miller curses under his breath, moves even faster
: -
3 Peters, against the window: (muffled) The door, Justin
Open the door
He fixes his gaze upon the outer airlock door
And beyond it, space
He speaks in a flat monotone: Did you hear it
-
3 They are stunned to hear his voice
Peters answers: Yes
Yes, Justin, we heard it
Keep him talking
Do you know what it was
(muffled) It gets inside you
It shows you things
horrible things
-
3 can't describe it
there are no words
- Weir sits alone, listening to the  on the intercom
(
) (intercom) What, Justin, what shows you
(
) (intercom) It won't stop, it goes on and on and on
(
) (intercom) What does
(
) (intercom) The dark inside me
escapes Weir's lips
He cradles his head in his hands
- (' ) Miller races across the surface of the Event Horizon, the only sounds, his  , and Justin's tortured , patched through on his radio: (
) (radio) It's inside and it eats and eats until there's nothing left
(
) (radio) "The dark inside
"
don't understand
(
) (radio) From the Other Place
: -
3 The other crew, they're there, they're waiting for me
They're waiting for you
won't go back there won't
-
3 Peters presses her face against the Airlock window, trying to calm him: Justin, look at me
Look at me
Open this door
runs up with his medkit
don't think she can talk him down
We need a sedative
If he opens the outer door he'll turn inside-out
Starck's hands fly as she re-wires the circuits
Sweat beads her face
Almost got it
-
3 (
) (muffled) Come on, Baby-bear, open this door
Justin looks at her with dead eyes
He reaches out to gently touch the glass between them
If you could see the things 've seen, you wouldn't try to stop me
You'd come with me
Justin's hand moves to the    control
Hesitates
then floats to the   control
Hits it
(muffled) yellow warning light flashes
warning klaxon , deafening
Justin jerks his hands to his ears, closes his eyes
Stand-by for decompression
Thirty seconds
Justin opens his eyes as if waking from a dream
Hey, Mama-Bear
what are doing
And then he realizes where he is
and what is about to happen
Oh my god
-
3 Starck
can't
The inner door can't open once the outer door has been triggered, it would decompress the entire ship
(muffled) You gotta open, you gotta stop it, please
We have to do something, oh God
(into radio) Skipper, Justin just activated the door
It's on a thirty second delay
- (' ) Miller moves through the Event Horizon superstructure, recklessly leaping from one beam to another, trying to build up speed
Patch me through to him
-
3 (
) (radio) Justin
Skipper, you gotta help me
Twenty seconds
tell them to open the door
(
) (radio) They can't do that Justin, now listen carefully
-
3 Miller moves faster and faster, his  echoing in his helmet
He can see the exterior airlock just beyond a deep chasm in the ship's superstructure
If he misses this jump, Justin will not be the only man to die today
He doesn't hesitate but leaps, soaring across the chasm towards the airlock
(radio) don't want to die
You're not going to die
Not today
want you to do exactly as  say and 'm gonna get you out of there, alright
-
3 But  can't
gotta get out of here
Skipper, please
(radio) Justin
won't let you die
Miller's words give Justin hope
He regains some control
Okay
okay
Justin breathes hard and follows Miller's hurried instructions: (radio) Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can
Five seconds
-
3 Miller lands on the superstructure opposite the exterior airlock
(radio) Exhale everything you got, Baby Bear, we can't have any air in those lungs, blow it all out
--
3 Justin goes into a fetal crouch and covers his eyes
Oh god -- He wheezes out all his air
--
3 Miller squats on the girder, ready to push off
He focuses on the 5 meters of space between him and the airlock
The outer doors
The rush of escaping atmosphere carries Justin's body out
Miller pushes off
catches Justin's body
sending them both back towards the open Airlock
Ice forms on Justin's body
His veins bulge
Blood fountains from his noise and mouth, forming a red icicle over his face
Miller pulls him into the Airlock
Five seconds have passed since the airlock door opened
--
3 Miller closes the Airlock behind them
Air  into the chamber
Justin's body hits the deck as "normal" gravity exerts itself
Miller opens the Inner Door
Peters and  rush in
Oh God
Justin
puts a tube in the Justin's mouth immediately, feeding him oxygen
've got a pulse, he's alive
Pressure
90 over 50 and falling
He's crashing
Blood bubbles from Justin's mouth and eyes
He , then , spraying blood from his mouth
He can breathe
That's good
Let's get him to Medical, go, go
Starck helps  and Peters carry Justin from the Airlock
Miller sits there, exhausted
Reaches up and pulls his helmet off
: -- Weir listens to (
) (intercom) Intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood
(
) (intercom) His peritoneum has ruptured
(
) (intercom) One thing at a time, let's keep him breathing
Start the drip, 15cc's fibrinogen, Christ, he's bleeding out
: -- One of the tanks has been activated
Swaddled in bandages, Justin floats within, suspended in green gel
The others -- , Starck, Peters, Miller, Weir -- look exhausted
He'll live
if we ever make it back
We'll make it
CO2 levels will reach toxic levels in four hours
Peters stands, looking at Justin's ravaged form floating in the tank
(gently) Peters
We need to know what happened to the crew
Before it happens to us
(weakly) 'll get back to the log
But on the bridge,  won't go back, back in there
Thanks
Peters exits
Justin said something about, "The dark inside me
" What did he mean
It means nothing
Is that your "expert opinion
" The only answer we've had out of you is " don't know
" Justin just tried to kill himself
The man is clearly insane
How would you explain your own behavior
What
On the bridge
You said "it" wanted you
Weir glances at Justin
--    -- But it's not Justin in the tank
It's his wife , naked, wet, dead
Weir stares at her
-- said that
Yes
You did
Weir blinks
Justin floats in the grav couch
Weir turns back to the others
don't remember saying that
(covers with a joke) Maybe 'm insane, too
Weir exits
-- Miller follows Weir out of the Gravity Couch Bay
want to know what caused that noise
want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock
Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations -- (exploding) That's bullshit and you know it
You built this fucking ship and all 've heard from you is bullshit
What do you want me to say
You said this ship creates a gateway
Yes
To what
Where did this ship go
Where did you send it
don't know
Where has it been for the past seven years
don't know
The "Other Place," what is that
'
(beat, calm again) don't know
There's a lot of things going on here that  don't understand
Truth takes time
That's exactly what we don't have, Doctor
: - Miller moves through the maze of the ship, heading for the Bridge
As he reaches a junction, he hears
(
) Don't leave me
Miller wheels like a cat, staring wildly down the branching corridors
Nothing
He is alone
Miller leans against the wall, sinks to the floor, rests his head in his hands
- The grotesque ship continues it's orbit as the moon Triton eclipses the sun
Darkness swallows all
: - enters, checks Justin's display
(
) Any change
turns, surprised
Miller sits, barely visible in the dark
No
No change
(beat) 've analyzed Justin's blood samples
There's no evidence of excessive levels of carbon dioxide
Or anything else out of ordinary
grim  from Miller
Of course not
Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it
Just one of those things
(beat) swore 'd never lose another man
came close today
Real close
"Another man
" Who
Miller nods, pulls his service medal from beneath his jumpsuit
It was on the Goliath
There was this bosun, Corrick, a young guy, a lot like Justin
Edmund Corrick, from Decatur, Georgia
He got caught when the pressure doors sealed, one closed on his arm
Severed it at the wrist
The pain of that must have been
He passed out and
Miller trails off
waits patiently
Finally: ,  tried to go back for him, to save him, but  couldn't get to him in time
The fire
Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity
It's like a liquid, it slides over everything
It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire
And then he was gone
(beat) never told anyone until now
But this ship knew,
It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick
It knows our secrets
It knows what we're afraid of
(beat, wan smile) And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide
No
Miller sees something in 's expression
What is it
've been listening to the transmission
And  think Houston made a mistake in the translation
Go on
plays the recording again
Stops it abruptly
They thought it said, "Liberatis me," "Save me," but it's not "me
" It's "tutemet:" "Save yourself
" It's not a distress call
It's a warning
It gets worse
Miller stares at him
It's very hard to make out, but listen to this final part
He plays the recording again
Do you hear it
Right there
Hear what
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi
" "Hell
" "Save yourself
From Hell
" (beat) What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed
No
don't believe in that sort of thing
(beat) But if Dr
Weir is right, this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe, of reality
Who knows where this ship has been
What it's seen
(beat) And what it's brought back with it
looks at Miller
He does not have an answer
The intercom : (
) (intercom) Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark
(into intercom) On my way
: - Miller stands in his  suit in the darkened bridge
He twists a manual valve
Alright, Cooper
- Cooper looks at Smith
Cross your fingers
- moment later, mist flows from the vents into the bridge, filling it with atmosphere
Miller watches the pressure rise on his suit gauge
(
) (radio) It's holding
She's holding
(
) (radio) We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole
You got it, Coop
Miller removes his helmet
Breathes deep
Back in business
: - Peters sits in front of the screen
The log is still distorted
Frustrated, she types in a series of instructions
Get to her feet
You got any coffee
It's cold
don't care
Behind Peters, the process refines, accelerates
pieces coming together like a jigsaw
Peters turns around
Sees the screen
The coffee slips from her hand to the floor
(tiny voice) Starck
Starck turns, sees the screen
Sweet Jesus
Miller
: - Miller, Starck,  watch the video
Peters turns away, miserable
Unable to watch
- still distorted by static and roll, but finally lucid: of the Event Horizon
On the Bridge
dislocates his shoulder with a   sound as he shoves his arm down his own throat
Blood bubbles from his nose
With a  sound, he pulls his stomach out his mouth
Behind him, a  and  fuck, covered with blood
She bites through his neck
His head lolls to the other side
She buries her face in the torn flesh as he thrusts into her again and again
Presiding over them,
His eyes are bloody holes
His hands reach out in offering
In the palms of his hands, his eyes
Kilpack opens his mouth and speaks with an
Liberatis tutemet ex infera
- Miller switches off the video
No one says anything
We're leaving
You can't, your orders are specific
"
to rescue the crew and salvage the ship
" The crew is dead, Dr
Weir
This ship killed them
And now it's killing us
You're insane
You've lost your mind
Maybe you're right
But it's still my command, and  have leeway to abort when  feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew
And think there is
(beat) Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers
Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark
(stammering) Don't
don't do this
It's done
: - Peters enters, carrying heavy CO2 scrubbers
Smith stops her
What's going on, sweethearts
CO2 scrubbers for the Clark
Miller pulled the plug on the mission
Smith smiles
About goddam time
Sequence omitted from original script
-    - Weir follows Miller down the Corridor
What about my ship
We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until am satisfied that she has been destroyed
(beat) Fuck this ship
You
You can't do that
Watch me
Miller turns to walk away
Weir grabs Miller, wheeling him around, almost frenzied
You can't kill her,  won't let you
lost her once,  will not lose her again
Miller shoves Weir back into the wall
The two stare at each other
Adversaries
The lights cut to emergency lighting
(
) (intercom) Miller, come in
Miller finds the intercom: Starck, what the hell is going on
- Starck peers at the Engineering board: (into intercom) We just lost main power again
-    - Miller and Weir are barely visible in the darkness
Goddammit
Starck, get those files and vacate
want off this ship
He releases the intercom
Weir's voice is a  as he backs into the shadows
You can't leave
She won't let you
Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll find yourself looking for a ride home
Weir is swallowed by the darkness
(
) am home
snaps on
Miller looks around
Dr
Weir has vanished
Weir
He slams the intercom: All hands
Dr
Weir is missing want him found and restrained
- Starck gathers all the files and disks
Shuts down the consoles, one by one
- Smith and Peters finish removing CO2 scrubbers from panels in the walls
Let's go, let's go, this place freaks me out
Last one
- Peters follows Smith down the First Containment towards the Main Access Corridor, carrying the last case of scrubbers
She begins to lag behind
echoes down the First Containment
(whisper) Denny
She turns back to the Second Containment
- dashes through the darkness in the Second Containment
Denny
- Smith
Peters turns, but Smith is already out of sight
She hesitates
Moves back towards Second Containment
Again, Peters hears the  of a child
The  of metal on metal
She slowly moves forward
- into the darkness of the Second Containment
Peters sees an open access panel
She looks inside
'  - narrow tube, vanishing into darkness
' echoes from far away: (
) Mommy
ducks her head and enters the access duct
Denny
: - Miller sits at Justin's engineering position
Flips a series of switches
- Cooper works on the patch as the ship's running lights come on in sequence
- The bridge lights flicker, illuminate
(to his ship) Thank you
(
) (radio) Captain, we got a problem
Now what
: -    - She was right behind me,  turn around, she's gone
She could be anywhere
Alright
Prep the Clark for launch
'll find her
: - ' Peters moves through the duct
Reaches a junction
Anything could be with her, there in the dark
child's , too faint for words
Peters turns
Behind her, , a   dashes across the corridor
Peters turns back
Too late to see
Again, the child's draws her onward
Denny
Denny, come to Mommy
is her only answer
She follows the sound, now climbing into a vertical shaft that takes her higher and higher
Hold on, Denny, Mommy's coming
- '  - Peters pulls herself up from the vertical shaft onto a catwalk that snakes between huge oily machinery, just in time to see
running, disappearing into the gloom ahead
Denny
She runs forward into a junction
The lights flicker red
Denny
Mommy
Her son can barely be seen in the flickering darkness ahead
You can walk
Denny, you can walk
oh, my baby
Wanna show you, Mommy, wanna show you something
He reaches his arms out to her
Peters steps forward, reaching for her son
falling into an open access hatch, hidden in the dark
'  - ( ) a twenty meter drop
- Peters hits hard, lies before the Core, an offering of flesh and blood
Her legs twist beneath her, shattered; blood pools around her head
Her chest heaves: still alive
(bloody gasp) Denny
- '  - Denny peers down from the top of the shaft and his hands in childlike glee
: - Weir wanders into First Containment, brooding
(to himself) won't
won't leave
This is my ship
- Weir enters the Second Containment
Freezes as he sees
Peters body lying twisted and broken before the Core
Oh no
Peters
He rushes to Peters
Reaches out to touch her but pulls his hand back
Her eyes are black, eight-ball hemorrhage darkening the irises
She is dead
Why did you do that
You didn't have to do that
(
) Billy
Weir looks up from Peters' corpse
stands before the Core
She is naked
Her skin is pale and beautiful and cold and wet
Her hair hangs in her face, covering her milk-white eyes
Claire stands naked before the bathroom mirror
Behind her, the tub steams
-   - ( ) Weir stares at Claire in shock
She walks to him
Slowly
She stops in front of him
Her arms hang at her sides
He must reach for her
He does, putting his hands on her hips
He slides from his chair to the floor to his knees
He presses his face to her pale belly and cries
wrack his body
and in the bathroom, she clutches Weir's straight-razor
- She reaches down
Slowly, her arms cradle his head
She slides down on him
Straddles him
Claire slips into the steaming water
- He raises his head to her breasts
His eyes, closed
She remains unnaturally still, only her hips rocking back and forth
Weir's mouth opens,  as he enters her
and the razor bites her skin
- She caresses his face
Lifts his face to hers
Her mouth is slack
Her hair hangs in front of her eyes
Claire floats dead in the red water, eyes open, hair billowing around her head like a halo
- Weir gazes up at her, transfixed
He takes her hand and raises it to his face
She caresses his cheek
And reaches for his eyes
- rips through the Second Containment Seal
It begins as a human sound and ends as something else, an alien  of rage
-    - The  echoes down the Main Corridor
- / packs up blood samples
He raises his head at the sound of the
- Starck  as the  resounds through the bridge
-    - Miller turns in the direction of the
He begins to move down the Corridor, towards the source
- Cooper examines the weld on the baffle plate
It's solid
Solid as a rock
(into his radio) Hey, Smith
- (
) (intercom) Smith, clear that airlock, man, 'm coming in
Roger that
Smith carries another load of supplies
Movement out of the corner of his eye
He turns in time to see Weir disappear around a corner inside the Event Horizon
Dr
Weir
Hey, get your ass back on board
Dr
Weir
No response
Smith keys the radio
Skipper, come in
-    - Miller jogs down the Main Corridor
An  gets his attention: (
) (intercom) Skipper
(into intercom) What is it, Smith
(
) (intercom) just saw Weir,  think he was messing around on the Clark
Something  and  in the dim light, catching Miller's eye
He looks up
One of the   has been removed from the its mounting in the Corridor
Smith, get out of there
(
) (intercom) Come again, Skipper
One of the explosives is missing from the corridor
think Weir may have put it on the Clark
- Smith's eyes open wide
(
) (intercom) Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock
No, no, we just got her back together
(
) (intercom) Get out of there now
But Smith has already left the airlock
- entering the Quarters, tearing through storage lockers
Where is it, where is it
-    - Smith
Smith
Fuck
Miller races down the corridor towards the airlock, towards his ship
- sound catches Smith's attention
He follows the sound to a storage compartment
Rifles through it
gotcha
gotcha
The  are coming closer and closer together
Smith grabs a duffel
gotcha
Opens it
He sees the   from the Event Horizon even as the  become a steady
He closes his eyes and
- -
1 - ( ) Miller enters the docking bay even as a   knocks him back
Safety doors close, sealing off the airlock and preventing loss of pressure
- The   tears the Lewis and Clark into two pieces, spiralling away from each other and from the Event Horizon
Metal shards, like confetti, fill the space between them
- Cooper clings to the forward section, watching the Event Horizon recede as he tumbles into space
His is the only sound
-
1 - ( ) Miller gets to his feet
Stares out the window upon the wreckage of his ship, spiralling away
He hits the intercom with his forearm
The Clark's gone
Smith and Cooper are dead
- / What happened
(
) (intercom) Weir
He used one of the explosives from the Corridor
The door opens behind
The lights go out
turns
Face to face with Weir
Blood crusts Weir's cheekbones, his mouth
He has no eyes
Only clotted, empty sockets
opens his mouth to
Weir grabs  by the throat, cutting him off
-
1 - ( ) , you read me
does not answer
The  of glass and steel resonates over the intercom
- / Too dark to see
glimpses of violent motion in the stainless steel cabinets
the sounds of  continue
then something
and the struggle stops
(
) (intercom) , come in
Finally, Weir emerges from the gloom
He searches among the surgical instruments until his blood caked hands find a needle
and thread
-
1 - ( ) Miller, at the intercom
He tries another channel
Peters
- Peters body lies before the Core
The intercom
(
) (intercom) Peters, are you there
-
1 - ( ) (growing panic) Starck, do you read me
Starck
But it is Weir who answers
His voice sounds thick, choked with dirt
(
) (intercom) told you
She won't let you leave
Son of a bitch
Miller yanks open a storage locker full of zero- tool
Lifts a nailgun
Chambers a round
: - Cooper watches the Event Horizon fall farther and farther away
He checks his oxygen gauge
One tank full, one tank at half
Cooper twists his backpack around, giving him access to the oxygen tanks
He seals off his primary hose and disconnects the full tank
His gauge immediately goes to "Yellow - Reserve
" Cooper points the full tank away from the Event Horizon and The blast of pressurized air pushes him towards the ship, leaving the wreckage of the Lewis and Clark behind
: - Miller races through the corridors to Medical
- / and finds , suspended above the table, neatly dissected
His organs have been laid out carefully before him on the steel table
Oh my God
raises his head
(whisper) Please
Oh, God, , what do
how do Please
kill
Oh God
Miller raises the nailgun with trembling hands
: - Miller approaches the door to the Bridge
It is open
- Miller stands in the doorway
figure sits at the helm
Miller aims the nailgun
Weir
The figure doesn't move
Miller slowly circles around the helm
It's Starck
Bound with wire in a sadomasochistic pose, unconscious
Hold on
Get you outta these
Miller kneels in front of her, puts down the nailgun, loosens the cords
She  in ragged gasps, opens his eyes
Then stops
She stares over Miller's shoulder like a deer caught in the headlights
Miller looks behind him
,
Miller reaches for the gun
Weir hits him, sending Miller across the bridge into a bulkhead
Weir picks up the nailgun, examines it
Miller slowly gets to his feet
Your eyes
don't need them anymore
Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see
What are you talking about
Do you know what a singularity is, Miller
Does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is
(beat) It is
Absolute and eternal And if God is Everything, then  have seen the Devil
(a dead man's grin) It's a liberating experience
With his free hand, Weir reaches for the navigation console
Flips a series of switches with gore caked fingers
-  ( ) The display lights up
Gravity drive primed
Do you wish to engage
- What are you doing
Weir grins as he flips the final switch
Gravity drive engaged
Activation in -minus ten minutes
Miller lunges for the nailgun
Weir raises the nailgun to point at Miller's face
Miller slowly backs away
If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull
You'll die too
What makes you think 'll miss
Miller sees something out of the corner of his eye
- Cooper
Outside, braced in the viewport bracket
- Weir spins and  at Cooper
The nail lodges in the thick quartz glass
web of cracks spreads out from the bullet, the glass  under the pressure
Weir takes a step towards the window, raises the gun to fire again
- Miller dives for the door
Before Weir can fire, -   ( ) the window  outward
- The ship  as air rushes out, ripping Weir off his feet
Weir catches himself in the broken window, trying to pull himself back in
monitor tears free,  into him
Miller pulls himself through the door as it begins to shut
He is safe
(
) Don't leave me
Miller turns
Starck clings to a console, barely able to resist the winds that try to suck her into the void
(gasping for air) Please
help, help me
Miller hesitates, looking from Starck back into the safety of the ship
The door continues to shut
In seconds, he will be safe
And she will be dead
Miller  and rips a compressor from its mount, wedges it in the door to keep it open
He keeps one hand on the door, reaches the other hand to Starck
Give me your hand
Your hand
She does
Frost forms on their bodies as the air cools
Their veins begin to bulge, blood pulses from their noses
He with exertion
drags her to the door
through the door
as the compressor tears free, sucked into space
and the door  shut, missing them by a fraction
- Starck and Miller collapse against the door
moment passes between them
Just happy to be breathing
and then the   goes off
The forward airlock
- Starck and Miller race towards the Forward Airlock Bay
-
4 They enter, see a humanoid shape moving in the strobing light of the airlock
Weir can't be alive
Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir
Miller looks around for a weapon
Pulls a zero- bolt cutter from the wall
Wields it like a bat
Stay behind me
The inner airlock door releases with a
Swings open
Cooper tumbles through, clawing at his helmet
Cooper
Starck rushes to him, takes his helmet off
He  air in,  it out
Let me breathe, let me breathe
You're okay now, it's over
(sees something) It's not over
It's just starting
Starck follows Miller's gaze to a workstations's flashing display:
00:06:43:01
Weir activated the drive
He's sending us to the Other Place
We've got to shut it down, we've got to
How
The Bridge is gone
There must be a way
What about Engineering
Can you shut it down
don't know the process, Dr
Weir was the expert
don't want to go where the last crew went
'd rather be dead
Blow it up
We blow the Corridor
Use the foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it from the rest of the ship
We stay put
and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before
: - You prep the gravity couches
'm going to manually arm those explosives
Will it work
It worked for Weir
Prep the tanks
Cooper nods, heads for the gravity couch bay
Starck follows Miller to the steel pressure door
'll do it -- No
'll be right back
Miller opens the door
Close it behind me
Just in case
Beat
Starck stares at Miller as if memorizing his face
Don't be long
Miller smiles wanly
The door slides shut with a dull
-    - Miller runs down the corridor
Stops at a bulkhead coupling
Kneels down to remove the cover from an explosive charge, switch it to  detonation
Miller runs to the next coupling
Repeats the process
- Starck and Cooper check the gravity couches
One by one, they slide open
'm gonna activate the emergency beacon
Hurry
Cooper exits down a ladder
Starck turns to the console, activates three gravity couches
Behind her, two begin to fill with blue gel
and one begins to fill with blood
the hint of dark shapes moving within
Starck doesn't see it, concentrates on the console
Starck turns
Sees the bloody tank
Sees something moving inside it
She slowly crosses to the tank
Peers at it
-    () , Bone and muscle are exposed where the skin hasn't finished forming
- Starck  and backs away
Cooper
The glass  in an
- corridor beneath the Gravity Couch Bay
Cooper searches through circuit panels until he finds the breaker
He runs a by-pass, activating it manually
The lights begins to
bloodstain spreads over his shoulder
He follows the drip to the ceiling
Starck
No response
He slowly moves to peer up the ladder
as Starck  down, bloody but alive
What
Run
She shoves him away
Weir appears at the top of the ladder, crawling down headfirst like a spider
Starck gets to her feet, staggers away
-    - Miller kneels, removing the cover from the last explosive
Flips a switch
small cover pops open
Miller reaches in, removes a He arms the explosives
Watches the red lights on the explosives wink on in the darkness
He reaches for an intercom
We're armed
This fucker's ready to blow
-   - () (
) (intercom) repeat, we're armed
Miller, he's back, he was in the tank
-    - Slow down, Starck,  can't understand you, who was in the tank
-    - figure seems to coalesce from the shadows behind Miller
(
) (intercom) You have to get back here now, he's out there now, if he finds you
The figure moves forward into the light
Arcane runes etch Weir's face; his eyes, now restored, blaze with unholy zeal
-    - Who
Who
(
) (intercom) Weir
He's dead
Miller glances over his shoulder
His jaw drops in surprise as he sees
-    - Weir grinning at him
then  the intercom with his fist, cutting off Starck's
-    - Miller backs away
-    - Weir stands between Miller and safety
-    - You're dead,  saw you die
Weir is dead
Then who the fuck are you
Your fear
Do you remember the Goliath, Miller
-    - ' , Do you remember me
Corrick
You left me behind
That's not true
begged you
begged you to save me and you did nothing
You stood there and watched me burn
The Burning Man  and raises his arm in accusation
and      , flowing over the walls, the ceiling, the floor, racing for Miller like a rising tide
-    - Miller runs
Dead ahead, the First Containment
- Miller runs fast
The fire is faster, flooding in behind him
Miller dashes for the Second Seal as
The fire gains on him, surrounding him
Miller dives through the Second Seal
- barely makes it
into the engineering console
Miller looks back at the Second Seal
It's still open by a fraction when the fire hits it
stabbing out towards Miller
He rolls aside as the fire hits the console
The console The Second Seal shuts tight, cutting the fire off
The paint on the Second Seal begins to bubble and scorch
and then cools as the fire subsides
Miller gets to his feet
Almost allows himself to relax
Then he sees his shadow before him, dancing in the growing red light
He turns
- The Second Containment is a holocaust
Fire swarms over the walls
Burning jelly drips from Control Spikes
The Core itself is a blazing orb; the gyroscope that holds it glows red-hot
Miller stares at the blazing Core
(
) Don't leave me
Miller turns
The Burning Man stands
He  Miller with a backhand that ignites Miller's clothes and sends him flying
The detonator falls from Miller's grasp, lost beneath two feet of coolant
Miller comes up  and
The Burning Man stalks towards Miller
The coolant and  at his feet
Miller stares at the Burning Man as he approaches
Slowly rises to his feet
You're not Edmund Corrick
The Burning Man's flames wane, revealing Weir's misshapen form
Miller throws a wicked right
Weir catches Miller's fist
until blood wells up between his fingers
Then slings Miller against a cooling tank with   force
Miller collapses into the slime, barely able to raise his head to breathe
Weir slowly approaches
What are you
You know
You want me to believe you're the Devil, well,  don't, that's bullshit
'm not the Devil
Then what, what are you
Tell me
Better if  just show you
Weir's hands reach down and he grabs Miller by the skull
Miller  as he sees
Faster than the eye can see
More than mind can accept
-  (  ) The   writhe naked and bloody in carnivorous frenzy
-   (  ) Peters' bloody grinning child, devouring his mother
- writhes in Weir's grip
His hands flail out to the sides
One hand brushes a long steel cannister sunk in the muck
CO2 scrubber
: - / (  ) 's dissected body, except that here,  looks up, and smiles
-  (  ) , red and bloated and dying
-  (  ) ; a sluggish, oily, black sea
hand reaches from the oil
(  ) floating dead in a bathtub filled with the thick black fluid
-   (  ) Justin, Starck and Cooper, crucified upside-down upon the Third Seal
- His hand closes on the scrubber and he swings it across Weir's head
Weir reels back, stunned
Miller gets to his feet
You can't have them
He hits Weir again
Blood gushes from Weir's skull, filling the runes on his face
Weir staggers
Miller attacks
Again and again and again
This time Weir is ready
He catches the scrubber and tears it from Miller's grasp
Miller to the floor with a single blow
Miller
'm not the Devil
'm much, much older
watched the Beginning and will see the End
am the dark behind the stars
am the dark inside you all
Miller gets to all fours, trying to get up
not the Devil
Weir kicks Miller savagely
Miller slides through the coolant, comes to rest beneath a walkway
He attempts to rise, collapses back into the sludge
Weir slowly stalks towards him
There is no Devil
There is no God
There is only
You're lying
'm not asking you to believe me
You'll see for yourself
and so will your crew
You're all coming with me
Starck
Cooper
Weir's grotesque face is inches from his
He reaches down and pulls Miller from the dripping ooze
They are mine
And so are you
as Miller clears the surface, he holds something in his fist
Miller stares dead-on into Weir's hellish face
and raises his right hand
'
(a grim smile of triumph) You can't have them
Go to hell
- small, silent  blossoms in the aft section of the ship
-    - followed frames later by a sequence of  that rip the Main Access Corridor apart and propel the foredecks away from the containment section
-  ( ) The  knocks Starck and Cooper down
They hold on tightly as
- Waves of distortion ripple over the Event Horizon's containment section
dark sphere of energy spreads out from the containment as the gateway opens
The black hole begins to shrink, imploding
As it collapses, it sucks Neptune's blue clouds with it, creating a with the black hole at its center
The  winds carry the foredecks back towards the whirlpool, towards the black hole
-  ( ) Cooper and Starck slide across the floor as the deck tips at a terrific angle
- The foredecks teeter on the edge of oblivion
The black hole collapses utterly, vanishing to a point
An enormous  rips out from the point of implosion
The foredecks ride the wave away from the implosion and out of Neptune's atmosphere to safety
- The  subside
Cooper and Starck stagger to their feet
Look out the window
-  / Neptune recedes, the ugly hole of the implosion already being erased by Neptune's violent winds
- Starck's voice is tiny
Miller
: - Black planets silhouetted by a dying red giant
The Engineering Containment of the Event Horizon drifts in the eddies of gas that swirl and spiral into the bloated star
towards the ship until its shadow consumes all
- Starck awakens but the  continue as the Event Horizon calls out to her
she
hands on her body
the stop
Starck looks around uncomprehending at the faces around her
' Cooper pushes them aside
She clings to him,
It's over, hush now, it's over
