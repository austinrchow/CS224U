She totes a skateboard under one arm (itself a berserk Jackson Pollock chaos of band stickers, silver marker and graffiti, with day-glo wheels), and transfers her impromptu bouquet so she may unzip a flap and hike up a ragged hood against the rain

Almost reverent

as Elly takes a single white rose and places it atop the grave near Shelly Webster's

Rain spatters the granite, darkening it

as it takes wing from it's unseen perch
Lands stop Eric's headstone
It pecks tentatively at the top of the monument
-   ' She hasn't gotten too far before she notices the bird
Oh, scary
The bird blinks at her from the headstone
What are you, like, the night watchman
Another blink from El Birdo

Brutal building facades, like dead eyes, and bad alleyways, like hungry mouths, are gradually revealed as we continue   to unveil that the cemetery is smack in the middle of the city

He grabs the dog from Mickey
Mickey puffs his cigar while he cooks
Albrecht methodically spreads a napkin and performs surgery on the hot dog, coating the bun with mustard, rolling the dog in the bun
Flashes Mickey a "gimme" look
Come on

Don't cheap out on me
Lotta onions
- Heyyy -- it's the Elly monster
How do you ride that thing on a wet street
Talent
Hi
Care for a hot dog

Elly grabs the stool next to Albrecht
They`ve done this routine before
No onions though, okay
(horror) No onions
They make you fart
Mickey laughs
Spots Elly a Coke
What's goin' on, Elly
went to see a friend of mine
Well, how's your friend
She's still dead
Albrecht and Mickey exchange a look re:  Elly's matter-of- factness

The crow pecks the top of the stone again and a chip of granite flies off, bang
- as the crow pecks again and draws blood from the rock
- - dot of blood on its ebony beak
- thin, watery trickle of blood wanders from the top of the stone towards the earth
Rain does not interfere
Lightning plays in the rolling cloud cover, b

as it takes off from the gravestone, into the rain
- - It slowly fills the name Eric Draven into the rock
- - like the  introducing Elly's boot
This time we see cowboy boots, leather chaps
The foot taps
Waiting
- as lightning strikes
Just enough for us to see a figure in a long duster and a cowboy hat
' fills with blood
Blood continues groundward

This is the
We glimpse the deathshead, beneath the brim of the cowboy hat

Magically, a slim white parts the earth to grasp the rose

Clad in cerements: cheap black burial suit, slit open in back
WHite shirt

No shoes
Rain sluices mud from his upturned face

Looks o

's  - water-blurred, through the rain, standing with the crow perched on his arm like a hunting falcon
He releases it and it flies to the tree

Wipes mud from his eyes, tries to clear vision
The crow lights in the tree and they meet eye-to-eye
Eric looks back o

and we  to include the Skull Cowboy
What the hell are you
Interested
Follow the crow
The Skull Cowboy speaks in nicely distorted, buzzlike charnal house whisper
Unsettling and hackle-raising
Eric turns back to the bird, which takes wing in the rain, His eyes follow it
He looks back, disoriented, doubtful, but the Skull Cowboy is gone
- Taking wing in the rain, showing the way
- alone in the cemetery
After a moments hesitation, he lurches off, following the crow

Skank notices the captive woman's handbag on the floor
Picks it up
Looks through it for valuables
What about working girl
the woman's increasingly horrified reactions
- What about her
say we leave her here to fry, man
-Bird looks casually at the woman
Smiles hideously
- No
Let's take her with us
- Her eyes bug in a terrified
-  - As the -Bird fishtails wildly around the corner and eats street
- -  - drives
One eye on his digital watch (doing an equally fast countdown)
Skank wrestles their captive, the woman, in the back seat
(pissed off) Skank, shut her the fuck up
SKank punches her and she sags
Then he looks forward
Whoaaa -- -Bird, red light, red light
- - As the -Bird slews wide, cutting sidewalk, scattering nightwalkers, immediately attracting everybody's attention
-  -  - Reacting, with a mouthful
Goddammit
Mickey grabs the counter phone instantly
Call it in
Albrecht is off and running for the corner already
Yeah, do it
(to Elly) Stay right there
He points at Albrecht's hot dog
Yecch

- The car slides to a nose-down panic stop
(
) Dump her, man, dump her
The woman comes tumbling from the car, which blasts off with a war hoop from the guys inside
-  - Gun out, hauling ass on wet pavement
Aims at the departing car
Gives it up
Still too far away
Pedestrians in the way
- hurting, cut, bleeding, tottering toward the dumpster
Duct tape stuck to her face but cut away around her mouth
With her as she falls into the alley darkness
straight into the arms of - - Their eyes lock
Eric stiffens with his first
:  Eric's flashes of past memory are conditioned by the nature of things with which he makes physical contact
Hints and fragments in fierce, super-saturated
Puzzle pieces he must assemble
Each flash keynoted by a   and accompanied by a degree of pain
It hurts to remember
:
- - ' The faces of Skank and -Bird are murky, ephemeral, their voices hideous, distorted echoes
knife snaps open
We see the blade
Blood
Skank hits her, pow
and -- - An airborne crow  spiralling up and away from them
: - perched on a fire escape, high above, watching and waiting
- She fades
He lets her drop away, horrified
And staggers back into the cover of the alley
Her blood is on his hands
- Skidding in, spotting the woman
Kneeling to her
Here now
You're gonna be okay
Can you understand me
'm a police officer
The woman is no longer in pain
Deathly calm now
He touched me and it stopped
The pain
What did you say
saw a ghost
Her eyes roll back and she dies in Albrecht's arms
Oh no
don't go, darlin', you stay with me, now
shit
- from Albrecht, the woman, onlookers, as police units screech up to assist
-   - Eric in lurching flight, panting
Stops and steadies against the wall across from the backside of Arcade Games
-   () Circling, then lighting on the fire escape above Eric
- ("") "" is what the crow "gives" Eric to see
Visually distinct and immediately identifiable
'  - Which he's already seen through the crow's eyes
- looking up at the crow
Disoriented
Doesn't understand
Suddenly he cottons, and covers his eyes just in time to shield from: - The rear windows  outward in a spray of fire and debris
- he reels back, crashes into a dumpster
Falls
- landing on the dumpsters edge near a pair of discarded combat boots in the trash
Flames
- The blood from his hands mars his burial shirt
He tears the shirt away, leaving his tie absurdly intact
Wipes his face with his shirt
Discards it
Stops, held by his discovery -- as his fingers explore the five puckered bullet punctures in his chest
Almost a circle
Comically, he feels his back foe exit wounds
Then hauls himself upright, coming level with the crow
His glance at the bird is almost accusatory
- THe Inscrutable
We should get the idea that some silent communication is taking place
- ' bare, muddied, frozen
to Eric
His gaze moves from the crow to the boots in the trash
He grabs them, pushes them onto his bare feet
His eyes catch the firelight

In the rain
: - We are now within the neon techno-depths of Club Trash
The music is hard, savage, primal:  a doom-laden Radio Werewolf band rules
Cabaret Blitzkrieg, packed with Death-to-Yup trendazoids
We'll see more of this circus later
Right now the   is our biggest clue to the flavor of this establishment since we are -- -   8X10 Thinly filmed in dust, mounted among dozens of other band shots
Visible among the posed members of a group called Diabolique is Eric, wielding guitar on the club stage
as people , 45-50, powerful, a seasoned assassin, cruel but loyal
His facade remains stony as he leads three other men briskly down the corridor
:   , 50ish, clad Chinese gangster style - white topcoat, white scarf, tinted shades - and two body guards supplying a power perimeter around him,lean, dark-haired Asian killers who would gladly die for Ngo Nwa, which they will in just a minute
They have just passed the Diabolique 8X10
Ngo Nwa's gloved fingers, in passing, leave little skid tracks in the dust that clear the eyes of Eric in the photo
As the foursome reaches the , Grange turns doubtfully -- suspiciously -- to Nwa
He will see me
unannounced
- As Grange keys in the enter code the door hisses open
Without a word, Nwa passes inside and the door is pulled shut in Grange's face by the Bodyguards, who post themselves to either side
'   - The door  and the   is
Through a large window (mirrored on the club side) all sorts of activity is visible through automatic mini-blinds
fly-vision bank of 12 monitors is hot with surveillance
, a painfully clean-cut, Armani-clad Asian, impeccable, almost dashing, but the dynamic here is crystal clear: Nwa is the King: Lao, the dark prince in this hierarchy
At the desk, Lao is startled from his contemplation of a tiny, perfect rat skeleton by Ngo Nwa's unheralded entry
The desktop is bare except for and Arcane Vietnamese fighting knife, half a meter long with an ideogrammed blade, dramatically positioned beneath an Artemide lamp
Lao rises and feigns servility
:  The following exchange will play , and entirely in (formal greeting) (dismissiveness, contempt, then chastizing anger as:) Nwa  the blade with some ridicule
(phony assuagement) (knows it's bullshit) Lao turns, staring out the blinds, fighting for control
Deep breath
He turns back to his "master
"  Nwa gestures broadly at the oppulent office, indicating that Lao should be grateful, but is somehow errant (respect is required) (begrudging agreement) Lao sees the blade
An idea
He lifts it reverently, bears it the Nwa hilt-first in both hands, as if bestowing a thing of immeasurable worth
(why give me this
) Nonetheless, Nwa accepts the blade
It gleams
Hypnotic
Even Nwa has to admire it
Turns it so the blade is pointed at his sternum
His attitude indicates Lao is too far away to do anything untoward
(sinister punchline) Lao spins through the air and - the blade  Nwa's chest, pinning him to the door
It's over so fast the gasp of astonishment never escapes Nwa
Lao is much more than merely treacherous, he is extremely capable
(in perfect English) When  spoke of an offering, didn't mean an offering to you
-  () Grange, standing out of arm's reach in the corridor, kills both Bodyguards with a double headshot as they turn in greeting as the door
-  - , , Lao exchanges a look with his right arm; Grange nods affirmatively
You gonna smoke his bones now, or however it is you do it
Lao smiles indulgently
He wipes the blood from the blade on the jacket of his ex-lord
Lao now bows to no one
-   - Eric, wearing the combat boots, climbs as the crow leads him
Up
He jams his hand on a rusty wedge of metal
Ouch
- - ' Blood flows from the gash
He vises his fist shut
- Eye-to-eye with the crow
Opens his hand
- - ' The blood flows back into the wound, which closes itself, leaving another scar
- Vising the rail
Speaks to the night
Almost a mantra
"My kitten walks on velvet feet, and makes no sound at all
And in the doorway nightly sits to watch the darkness fall
think he loves the lady night
" (to crow) Am  alive
Am  dead
Something else
Something in between
- - Inscrutable
No answer here
Almost bemused
Steadier
hint of friendliness
Thanks for sharing that

Menacing
'   - junkyard of loot and dusty discards
Junkie thievings and other people's stereos
Behind a wire-meshed security counter reads a racing form, chain-smoking throughout the scene
He is pear-shaped, stubbled, unkempt
Food on his shirt of doorbells
Gideon lowers his paper to reveal Skank and -Bird on approach
Ahhh, jesus, the creatures of the night, here they come
Tweedledum and Tweedledummer
Skank riles Hey, blow me, fat boy
Just as quick, Gideon cocks and levels a Magnum at Skank
Blow yourself, bigmouth

He lifts a small carton onto the counter
Whatcha got
- Transaction time
-Bird passes items through the screen slot and Gideon gives each one cursory, doubtful inspection
- Coupla more rings

18k
Crap
- necklace

Nineteen bucks at Sears
Fake, - Leather purse
He hands though the bag rested from the woman
What's this -- a little, ah, bloodstain, right
(doesn't matter) Fifty bucks for the box, and 'm doin' you a -- - Yeah,  know, fatso
Do us all a favor
Make Top Dollar smile
You wouldn't want Top Dollar not to smile
Mention of Top Dollar clams Gideon efficiently up
He hands over the cash to -Bird with a grimace
-   - Eric stares upward at the crow as it drops like a bomber from the night sky, flying past him, skimming the roof, leading him on
Eric exhales, shrugs, feeling mocked by the bird
All right
And he takes off on a run
Only to stumble and fall
But the falls turns into a   that lands Eric back on his feet still moving
He looks back as if to ask: "Did  do that
" and runs out of the frame
-
as he squints towards the crow and does his best to keep up
to the edge of the roof, heavily misted in rain
He jumps a negligible gap to the next lower roof
The next roof-top is a one-story jump down
Eric clears the jump with a of air
Keeping his eyes on the flying crow; gaining strength
His next leap is more like a broad-jump
Athletic
- keeping airborne, keeping ahead
- Eyes confidently on the sky as he arches out into space
- As Eric is seen to jump across the gap at least three stories up where there is no connecting building
- as Eric smashes into it, just missing, hinging at the waist, grabbing for purchase, suddenly panicked, gravity pulling him downward
- Eric falls but manages to grab the bracket one-handed
He hangs for another deadly moment, then slowly, to his own astonishment, executes a one-handed pull-up that will save his ass
Gotcha
He completes the pull-up, bringing his chin level with the ledge
As he reaches for it with his other hand the bracket rips from the wall and Eric plummets, with a howl of defeat
- ' It's a looooooong way down
- as Eric lands and splits a trash can in two
beat as we wonder if any bones are left unpulped
as Eric rolls from facedown to his back
- ' as he completes the roll, gasping, amazed he's still in one piece
-  - It flies easily down to inspect Eric as he slowly sits up, examining his hands
Frustrated and pissed off
Thanks

It waits

The crow lands simultaneously b

The crow lights on a scarred banister knob
Eric's footsteps come down into frame

Dark, chilly, damp

Glass blown out
Shards poking
Jagged

Extends his hand
The cat nears; likes Eric

Sudden white jolt - a

Shelly and Eric, once upon a time
- as the cat, dropped, hits the floor and scrambles out of the way

Don't look

No
He whirls unexpectedly and punches his fist completely through the masonry wall

Funboy pops the bullet, like a contact capsule and washes it down

Into it, almost jazzed, Tin-Tin downs his bullet and shot, and -Bird does likewise
Points to Skank
- No
'm not the lunatic
He is
Skank riles, pulls a huge Auto Mag and sticks it in -Bird's face, cocking
Fuck you, -Bird
Just as lightning fast, -Bird has his own gun out and jammed right under Skank's jawbone
He makes a kissy face

They all crack up laughing like ax murderers
Skank drinks, Tin-Tin spot checks the satchell from Top Dollar's
Darla delivers more shots and funboy feels her ass

Pushes himself up

Pushes himself up

He reaches to touch the dark stain of old blood

-Bird instantly on top of her, rough

where he cuts open his hand on jags of glass

Five bloody bullet holes in Eric's chest

Skank backhanding Shelly
Shelly blowing bubbles from a clawfoot tub full of suds
Eric catching Funboy's first slug high in the chest

More fun than a torture chamber

Eric's paper mache masks of Comedy and Tragedy still hang there
The Skull Cowboy steps out of the dark and into the vague blue light
Shadowy as ever
Having fun yet
No
(beat) 'll give you a hint
Remember whatshername
Shelly
Miss her
Yes
Kill the men who killed you both, and the Day of the Dead will be your reunion
The Skull Cowboy prestidigitates a flat throwing knife(like Tin- Tin's)

He points to the crow

As he  out of the path of the knife he sees through the bird's eyes
He rolls
It hops out of the way as the knife embeds in the wall
Eric's finishes him up nearby
Goddammit
He grabs for the knife as if to use it on the Skull Cowboy, but the knife causes an unexpected painful
:  Eric bouncing off the bedroom doorframe, Tin-Tin's knife stuck in his shoulder
vising his head with his hands, in pain
Too much pain
Get it
Leave me alone --
He looks up, the Skull Cowboy is still there
(contempt) Do something about it

horrible beat between them
The Eric runs full tilt across the room, bounding to the open window and then leaping
- as close to surprise as he gets
Steps out to watch as -- - feet first out into space
- - Eric's fingers smash into grip the tiny mortared gaps
-     - High above, Eric's feet shoot out the window, knocking loose stray shards that fall toward frame
He swings into an upside- down pose, impossibly holding himself rigid against the building's side, face down
by his quarter-inch finger grip
- - Every muscle rigid, quivering with tension
Hold
Then he relaxes, and swings back inside
-  ,    - He arches, flips, to land on his feet
The Skull Cowboy is gone
No knife either
The crow watches
"meow"
- guess 'm not ready to leave
just yet
He picks up the cat -- wary of flashes, which don't come this time -- and returns to the window
Feeling safer
(') The last time we saw each other, didn't do so well
(holds cat up) Huh, Gabriel
He moves to the fireplace
With his free hand, lifts the Tragedy mask off its hook
Puzzles it, fact-to-mask
(') bet you need some cat food
right
-  -: Eric walking, the Tragedy mask hanging from his hip
An occasional  passes without comment, brutalized by the city
Eric, more confident, smells the night's bouquet

-   - As Eric reacts to what the crow has just seen
Slows
Stops
And directs his attention toward the mouth of the alley
-   - - He pulls the nickel plated revolver from the satchel
as he hands it across to , who removes the suitcase-sized boom box (the source of the music) from his shoulder to accept
Ratso is a feral skull-head; street trash
- Three hundred and your a gunslinger
- - and As the crow is still watching, yet perched
brief shove-and-standoff
The gun deal has gone bad
Please, TIn-Tin, you know 'm good for the money, man,  promise, Leslie put me up to it, please, man, don't -- (choking scream) Tin-Tin has just up-rammed a throwing knife into Ratso
- Ratty -- shut the fuck up
Tin-Tin lifts Ratso on the knife, gutting him
Ratso goes slack, deader'n hell
Tin-Tin reaches around to click the boom box
then let's Ratso`s corpse fall
(
) Another satisfied customer
- - galvanized by the surprise voice
He automatically draw a fresh knife from the bandolero of knives across his chest inside the coat
Can't yet track the source of the voice
- Who the hell is that
(beat, venomous) Come on out man,  won't hurt you
- He steps out from behind another flaming trashcan
Wearing a long black scarf and the Tragedy mask
Hello, Tin-Tin

And cover
And buy time
- Little early from trick-or-treat, homie
(re: Ratso) This dick trying to bushwack me
Murderer
Tin-Tin blows out a breath
No bluff
Time to kill again
- Guess you got that goddamn right
He shrugs
The shrug becomes the launch of a knife
-  - His black-gloved hand slaps away the incoming knife and inch from his nose
It
Eric continues striding toward Tin-TIn
Try harder
Try again
-   - as Tin-TIn throws another knife
Eric closing in
He claps hand together, immobilizing the next knife
Opens his hands, almost an "oops" gesture
Keeps on coming

Tin-Tin attempts a roundhouse
Eric blocks it and smashes Tin-Tin into the alley wall

Halloween
man and a woman
In a loft
You helped to murder them
- Last Halloween, eh
Yeah
(beat) Yeah,  remember
fucked her too,  think
You cut her
You raped her
(rage) You watched
- Hey,  got my rocks off, so fuck you in the ass, man
They're face-to-face now, sweaty and tense
Eric peels off the Tragedy mask
want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin
- don't know you
But, as Eric bears down on Tin-TIn, Tin begins to recognize him
Fear
Sweat
For the first time, Tin-Tin starts to loose control
- (') Holy shit
you're dead, man

Aren't we all

,  -  () Shelly's vanity
Dusty, disused
The mirror spiderwebbed with cracks but still hanging precariously in its frame
Eric is seated, his image crazily split into many
He pulls on a long- sleeved, tight-knit, black shirt
to reveal the loft now lit with dozens of candle stubs
Placed all around
Ceremonial and weird
- - Halloween is coming
The Day of the Dead
In the mirror, multi Eric's
He touches the glass, tightening up as he realizes he's in for another -- :  Shelly, sleeping on her divan, a year ago, wakes as Eric (
) says "Boo"
She cracks an eye open
Your scary quotient needs work
- Considering old cosmetics
Everything he touches will hurt him
But he's ready to eat this pain
He grabs a lipstick
:  Shelly at the vanity in happier times think red's my color, don't you
wincing
He drops the lipstick on the floor
Grabs a hairbrush
:  Eric smashes into the street after his death-fall, trailing broken glass
- Later
He's wearing white pancake makeup on his cheeks
Shaky
:  Eric sucks up Funboy's gunshots in the chest
1-2-3-4
his face a crazy warpaint maze of white streaks, not blended yet
He looks at his own reflection
In one cracked, triangular facet of the mirror is not a multiple of his face, but the Skull Cowboy
Just one
Glad to see you're finally with the program
Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, 'm busy
You work for the dead
Forget that, and you can forget it all
The Cowboy tips his hat and isn't there
Eric sees the crow perched on the edge of the mirror now
Forget this
He smears the streaks until his face is uniformly grave-wave white
- coming in to sniff around the clutter at the foot of the vanity
Eric looks down towards him
and toward the lipstick he dropped
- - ' as it glides down to pick up the lipstick

- She always red red was her color
- We see only a reflected corner of Eric's mouth as he duplicates the blood trail in red lipstick, making one one half of a crow harlequin smile
-  - as lightning strikes; a storm brews
-  - - - ' crossing the floor
Tin-Tin's knife slotted to the bucklework

Thunder rumbles long o

- The storm boils
Eric framed in broken window
- Eric all in black,  Firm-wrapped
Tight-wired
The trenchcoat flutters, cloak-like
His shadowy face framed by the upturned collar, his hair punkish and spiky
- as he moves forward in the light
The crow lights on his shoulder
All right, bad guys
- Full crow regalia
Face makeup streamlined
Eric's eyes flash

Funboy's not here, neither is -Bird -- none of Top Dollar's number ones
You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper
Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment
This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin
Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names
He was a runner for Top Dollar
Just muscle
Was
(sigh) This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway
This was somebody else
Somebody new
Albrecht lights a fresh smoke
Torres waves the smoke away
And you're gonna tell me who
Who ever made that
Albrecht points

If you want, you can call it graffiti

s
Irritated
Piss off, we're closed
As the outside security gate rattles, Gideon draws his magnum and approaches the front door
Fucking creatures of the night; they never goddamn learn
Sudden surprise as he sees the silhouette of the gate  back against the frosted glass of the front door
(') And he hustles to close up the distance between himself and the door, gun up
Before he can touch the door, the crowbar comes rocketing through the glass, pegging Gideon in the forehead and knocking him flat on his ass
He loses the pistol
Eric walks through the door, causing the fractured glass to disintegrate around him
He disclaims, thespian
"Suddenly  heard a tapping, as of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door
" (pause) You heard me rapping, right
- reacting to Eric's weird appearance and looking for his gun
Oh, bullshit
You're trespassing asshole, you're breakin' and enterin' and you just bought me a fucking door
During Gideon's rant, Eric brushes glass cubes from his shoulders, nonplussed
Now he flings Gideon across the room
Gideon crashes into the counter cage
As Eric advances on him: 'm looking for something in an engagement ring
Gold
As Eric comes up behind him, Gideon reaches through the open cage door and pulls a big combat knife from beneath the counter
You're looking for a coroner,shit- for-brains
And he tries to nail Eric with the knife
-   - No Eric behind him
to reveal Eric hanging off the cage above Gideon
Eric slams the cage door against Gideon's head
Drops down like a spider and collects the knife
repeat: a gold engagement ring
It was pawned here, a year ago, by another gentleman whose name, believe was
"-Bird"
Eric twists Gideon's sail-like shirt and Gideon turns bright red
(') Cute nickname, don't you think
(gasping) ain't got no fuckin' ring
Wrong answer
Eric nails Gideon's hand to the counter top
Gideon howls
All's  got is in a box
Behind the counter
Eric jumps through the cage door
Gideon's eyes bug as he sees his own pierced hand, immobilized
- scans the shelves
Rows of boxed ammo
Kerosene tins
shotgun
Knives and assorted knuckle duster curios
And the ring box
- -     '
Dozens of gold rings
Eric's fingers sift through them
He brings each ring to his face
with Gideon's feeble struggles and invective, o
s
No
no
no
no
He tosses each rejected ring over his shoulder
Until: - -    ' Obliterated by a stab of brilliant white light -- :  Shelly's face
perfect vision
He closes his fist tightly around the ring
moment of decision
Then he draws the shotgun from beneath the counter
Uses the butt to knock the knife free of Gideon's hand
It goes spinning across the countertop
Eric shucks the shotgun and rams it into Gideon's nose as the big man slumps to the floor
Tin-Tin confided in me, before he ran out of breath
You have one chance to live
No fucking way
He'll kill me
Who would waste time killing you
besides me
Gideon sweats, pants, contemplates the hole in his hand
(cowed) Top Dollar
Another jolly nickname
You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar
-Bird
Like the car
He hangs out with Skank
that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there
Ask Top Dollar
whole club of pirates, with pirate names
Eric seems to go berserk,  and  cans of flammables and powder while Gideon flinches, nursing his holed hand
Blows just miss Gideon's head
Soon he's cowering
- Looking down at Gideon in revulsion
You feed off the living
as another tin ceases to exist next to Gideon
Then Eric is gone, past him without further word, ignoring him entirely
As he exits, shotgun shouldered, he pauses to admire a white Fender Strat hanging among the pawnables
He reaches for it
As he summons some last minute budget bravery
You walk outta here Top Dollar will erase your ass
Top Dollar owns the fucking street here and you can't dick with me, you son of a bitch
- The guitar now bowslung across his back, the shotgun levelled at Gideon's position
One chance to live
Take it
as he realizes what Eric means
Hauls ass and bangs through the rear door with a bleat of terror
- as he cuts loose with the shotgun
'   - as seen from across the street
Eric silhouetted, unmoving as the whole store front blows hellaciously out around him, raining glass and debris
Stirring his hair
Eric is the black eye of the fireball
-     - lit by flames and residual explosions
He hurls the shotgun into the inferno
Casually brushes flaming/smoking detritus from his own clothes
(
) Don't move
said don't move
- as he turns slowly, to see Albrecht, out of reach, gun drawn
Eric's attitude lightens; Albrecht is not the threat here
thought the police always said "freeze:
Albrecht divides his attention, jumpy, between the odd sight of Eric (guitar on his back), and the raging instant inferno of Gideon's
'm the police and  say don't move, Snow White
You're under arrest;  don't care what else is wrong with you
You move and you're dead
Eric has begun to pace towards Albrecht
Palms up
gesture of submission
Albrecht's battle calm begins to waiver
And  say 'm dead
and  move
No further
'm serious
Eric bows, bringing his forehead in line with the gun's muzzle
Then shoot, if you will
- He gives it up
Can't shoot
This is too weird for him
Are you nuts, walking into a gun
-   - You must listen carefully:  the Fire Department will be here soon
There is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance
(meaningfully) As Shelly Webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance
Albrecht gestures casually, almost comically, with his pointed gun

Eric listens to them, to the night
Listen:  Top Dollar

Fucking , my friend
The others are called Skank, - Bird

Eric lifts a chunk of glass from the sidewalk
Slow and easy
Albrecht doesn't completely trust him
Up comes the gun
Watch it
Eric slices open his palm
Blood flows
To his fingertips

then exhibits the gashed hand to Albrecht
- - ' as the blood retreats and the wound seals itself up
and the silhouette
Mouth hangs

If you're not some kinda child molester

Who, me
Genuinely amused
He shakes his head no and sits down next to Elly
- The music  and smoke is everywhere, like incense
of the clientele, retro, robotic, clove cigarettes and rubber clothing; fetish casual wear

As Albrecht's hand moves the photo we can see in the file several band shots of Eric as a member of Diabolique
including the shot on Lao's wall gallery of past performers at Club Trash
on a paper plate suddenly touches down in the middle of all this research, startling Albrecht
- Don't thank me
Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit

Both are naked in a shabby bed
Bare lightbulb above
Ooh, baby -- gimme all of it

- As the crow quite unexpectedly arrives and perches on the sill, scaring the shit out of our two dopey friends
Funboy pulls a giant auto pistol; mock aims, calms down, doesn't fire
It's a big fucking bird
She falls back against her pillow, eyes dreamily defocusing
Funboy giggles
Relaxes the gun, which half-disappears into the sheets at his side
It's a squab
Here bird, Here, birdie
- Except that Eric now stands near their bed, across from the bird's position, the guitar bowslung
Here Funboy
Contained panic as Funboy and Darla both startle
The needle flies and lands at Eric's feet
Empty
Funboy struggles to maintain against his high
Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do that, man
nearly had a fucking heart attack
Fun -- look at that guy
It's just the dope, don't worry Fun, he's not going away; he's scaring the piss outta me
Not me
Funboy draws the gun from underneath the sheers
Suddenly he seems totally focused
(') Time for you to take your bird and leave, freako
Eric rips open his shirtfront to reveal a circlet of bullet punctures
This gives Funboy pause
Take your shot funboy
You got me, dead bang
Funboy tilts the gun off target
Grins as Eric flat handedly past his chest, indicating where to shoot
You are seriously fucked up, man
Just look at yourself
In a blur, he sighs, and shoots Eric through the heart
(') He shoots, he scores
Then his expression drags a little bit
- Looking down and daubing his hand in the bullet wound on his chest
Bull's eye
Good shot
- who starts scrambling to get out
Grabbing clothes on the floor around herself
she runs right into Eric's outstretched hands
Stay
Eric twists her arm
- - '
where we may clearly see the needle tracks
- Morphine is bad for you
He holds her arm captive
Tight, and we    to see the dope evacuating from the punctures, a reverse of Eric's, Blood trail
The dope drips from Darla's arm to the floor
Darla's eyes roll up into the unconscious
She slumps
-   - How the hell did you do that
Magic
Funboy regards Eric's battlescars and guitar
Either die or do a solo
Eric looks briefly to his chest wound, wincing
He can't seem to make it tie off fast enough
He turns his attention back to Funboy
But his strength is mysteriously ebbing
Neither
Yeah,  got a more fun idea myself
Funboy lashes out and broadsides Eric across the temple with the gun
Eric falls, rolls back to a stance, but Funboy is right on top of him, howling like a lunatic and pistol-whipping Eric relentlessly
hate trespassers
(whack
) hate prowlers
(whack
) hate peeping toms
(whack
) And right now  hate you
- as Eric, caught off-guard by Funboy's hyper high and weakened by his wound, comes slamming into the wall, losing his footing
Here comes Funboy, and we   from Eric's position as he looms, cocking the pistol, which now has Eric's blood on it
Ahh, the hell with it,  still got five shots left
In a blur, Eric grabs Funboy`s gun hand
Twists to the crunching of bones
Funboy's skewed-around gun hand blows a hole in his own thigh
Funboy fall back across the bed
Owwwaaaa -- fuck me
Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit
AAAAaa
Goddd
Does it hurt
Does it hurt
You dead-ass, clown-faced fuck, of course it fucking hurts
What the shit are you gonna do about this
Eric sits on the bed next to Funboy; inspects the ampule of morphine on the nightstand, the needle of the syringe already inserted
have some pain killer right here
And he fills the syringe all the way
as he begins to see the light
He can't get away
Growing terror
No, wait, no , that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it --
Your pain ends now
And Eric rams the needle into Funboy's heart, driving home the full dose
Funboy begins to convulse
Eric falls back on the bed, his force spent
Darla   in the corner, shock-traumatized
On
, and Eric opens his eyes
The Skull Cowboy, standing in the room, tips his hat
Howdy (beat) You look a mess
Like an ole cooter dog
- ' streaked with -- mostly -- his own blood
- Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we
Go away
You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going
Shut up
Maybe  was wrong about you
The Skull Cowboy seems saddened or disappointed
All we get is a little shake of his skull-head
Darla makes a  and Eric turns toward her
She's really confused
She's looking to Eric for some kind of answer
Your daughter is out there, on the street, waiting for you
She's stunned, utterly speechless
All she can do is look in Eric's eyes, try to ponder the phantoms there
Go
Now
Darla shoves helter-skelter past Eric and out the door without a glance back at Funboy
Eric, recovering, follows slowly, staring at the open door, stooping to lift the guitar dropped during the fight with Funboy
The Skull Cowboy has vanished
Grimly, Eric takes a syringe and begins to draw blood from the late Funboy
- As a hastily dressed Darla  out through the fire stair door behind Grange and  the Pit
Hey, g'night, Darla
(to Grange) That there is Darla
Funboy
Bartender indicates  with his thumb
Grange moves to the fire stairs door
'  - Grange has seen the door ajar and now  gun-first
Freezes when he sees: - Half-sheeted, bloody, a hypo hanging out of his heart
Eyes darting, drawn to -- '  - crow silhouette spray-painted with a syringe of Funboy's blood
thin outline, drippy
whirling with his gun to bring it to bear on -- - The crow is no longer in the room
Eric is perched on the sill, guitar and all, looking right at Grange as if waiting from him
He winks, holds a finger to his lips -- sshh --and jumps out into the night
- He almost fires, but doesn't
We see instead the priceless expression on his face as we -- : - Albrecht lights another smoke, quitting for the night
Waves to the late-working Annabella en route
- Albrecht hasn't gone three steps before Eric appears behind him, cat silent, matching pace
:  Eric has got a new black rock-n-roll shirt on
and a shell casing from Funboy's gun tied in his hair
Freeze
Albrecht startles; drops his file
Nearly draws his gun
Jeezus
Don't ever do that, man
Albrecht pants, hysterical but calming down
Eric waits
(') told you cops don't say "freeze"
He retrieves Eric's doctored photo from the spill of papers
(') You, my friend, are dead
saw your body
You got buried
saw it, too
Albrecht gathers up the file
Eric stands there
We realize he is hesitant about touching the file
(') Walk with me
As Albrecht comes up with the file as they walk
- You died, man
can't believe it but here you are
Last year, you and your girlfriend -- need you to tell me what you remember
What happened to us
You went out the window
She was beaten and raped
She died in the hospital
They stop
Eric didn't know this
Fixes Albrecht with a look
(') Hey, you asked, man
(beat) She held on for thirty hours in intensive care
Hemorrhage, trauma
He body just finally gave it up
(beat; regret) saw it and couldn't do jack for her
Eric has grown increasingly distraught over Albrecht's lines
Now he turns to Albrecht and, holding Albrecht's temples with his fingers, puts his thumbs over Albrecht's eyes
- We see Eric react to a brutal Flash
but we don't see the Flash
- And Eric tears from Albrecht; staggers back, now holding his own head
His crow face slacked in realized horror
You okay, man
mean, what just happened
The venom of bad memories
You were there; you saw her
saw you seeing her
Understandable nervous, Albrecht lights up a cigarette
You gotta understand --  was hoping she'd talk, give me a lead, a clue, something to work with
But she only said one thing to me before she died
Eric lowers his head, penitent
My name
(fizzles) 'm sorry as hell, man
Thirty hours
day of life, plus change
- - Eric plucks the cigarette from Albrecht's lips, taking a single contemplative puff from it
Halloween is coming, soon
You will have Top Dollar if you watch for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night
should be trying to stop you
Eric nods, keeping his eyes on the cigarette
Thank you
For giving a damn
My pleasure
Don't smoke these
As a bus grumbles past on the street, Eric pitches the butt and simultaneously ducks out of frame
- to see a blank building wall
Fire escape
Darkness
No Eric
He does a full 360 degree turn
Eric is gone again
Damn,  wish he wouldn't do that
- Coat flapping, Eric is standing on the bus roof as the bus moves away from Albrecht's position
- Lao has the partially disassembled rat skeleton in front of him, as well as a mortar and pestle with some bits of crushed bone, and is smoking powdered rat bone in a pipe and Grange reports to him
The son of a bitch winked at me
The he jumped
Three stories
Lao seems strangely unaffected by the bizarre nature of Grange's tale
Did you see an animal of any kind
Did you see a bird
(puzzled) No
saw a guitar
(beat; irritated) This isn't some rock-n-roller you forgot to pay, is it
(beat) There was a drawing on the wall that looked like a bird
In blood
Lao's expression is one of sublime content
Good

Look at each other and sanctimoniously cross themselves
Tin-Tin's big
moment
-Bird indicates the liquor store
- We need some smokes and some road beers
Got it
Skank hustles toward the store
-Bird crosses to the car
- - - to include the car as he nears it
Behind him, two 12-year-old ,  and , enter the store after Skank, one wearing a long duster
- as the  enter and split between the counter and magazine rack
East Indian
Two boys fight video game wars in the corner
Skank browses, grabbing odds and ends
/
-   - as -Bird climbs in, digs the last cigarette from his pack, snaps his Zippo and in the sudden orange light, sees: - Eric's purloined Strat in the back sear reflecting the light
- - He tries to spin and draw his gun but Eric is upon him, nestling one of Tin-Tin's throwing knives right inside -Bird's ear
- What the fuck are you supposed to be, man
:  Eric liberates -Bird's automatic from the shoulder holster; Eric's hand closes -Bird's door for him
'm your passenger
You drive
And stop talking
- -' on ignition key and gearshift, making ready
As ordered
-     - He looks outside and sees Eric as the car fires up, pipes and glasspacks grumbling
Skank moves,
What's all this happy horseshit
And the car peels out maniacally
Skank tries to pursue -- but the two  draw weapons and freeze everyone in the store
Alright, alright, alright -- everybody be cool and stay exactly where you are
Chopper hustles up to the counter and relieves Skank of a gigantic Auto Mag
Whooooa, cowboy
Cool gun
Off Skank's look of total outfoxed disgust
-- - -   - Vertiginous windshield  of onrushing street, highspeed
(
) Faster, -Bird
Faster
You're a hell of a wheelman; you know you can drive faster
-   - Eric now holds -Bird's own gun on him
Eyes locked on -Bird
-Bird's jump between Eric's nightmare visage and the roadway
- You call it, blood -- you got the gun
You just tell me where you want to go
Clearly -Bird would relish bisecting Eric with a meat cleaver as he says this
He's nervous and needs to hold the road
That's good
We're going someplace you've never been before
-    - - as the car burns up the obstacle course of pavement, kicking wake of litter
scurry to clear the way
- Parked in an alley, facing the street
Two cops work on large styro cups of steaming coffee
(driver) and
Smells like rain
Smells like a septic tank
You got that cream stuff
In the bag
Speeg rummages inside the takeout bag
hate this cream stuff
They can't even call it cream, legally
They snap to as the -Bird blazes past, doing ninety
What in the crap
floors the pedal, drenching Speeg in coffee on takeoff
Ow
Owowoowowoowo, goddammit
-   - as the cruiser roars out to give chase
- -   - Eric lends the chase car a backward look
You caught one
Drive faster
- Man, you gonna get us killed dead and  don't even know what you want
Eric cocks T_Bird's pistol and levels it at his face
want you to stop talking
And drive
Drive faster
Eric rifles the glove box, tossing items out the window: clips for the gun
Sunglasses
giant dildo (brief eyebrows-up to -Bird)
Then: a roll of (previously established) gaffer's tape
What Eric needs
- - as he sees a second cop car join the high speed pursuit, (') You're very popular
Thought you could handle this thing
-Bird macho calcifies
He's going to win
- To hell with you
(wry) Naturally
- Climbing swiftly toward the 100 mark
-   -   - 3-way pursuit until the -Bird reaches the outskirts of the city
- All quiet
until the -Bird  past frame
The lead cop tries to duplicate the -Bird's corner-cut and starts spinning
It clips a light pole
Rebounds into the path of 's unit
-     -  - as  stands on the brakes
Collision imminent
They howl
- as 's unit broadsides the first cop car
- The -bird careens through dockside silence, alone, then fishtails, , to a lung-compressing halt
- -    - - -bird respirating like a jackhammer
Eric holds stoic
- So what -- you gonna rape me now
Time for your reward,
Payback with interest earned
Eric rips a long strip of tape from the roll
- of the car as Eric opens the trunk
'  - The Trunk
loaded with plastique, canisters, timers, arson paraphernalia
- -  - - starting with -Bird's foot, firmly taped to the pedal
Mummified into his seat
Hands taped to the wheel
Throat taped hard against the headrest
The car is now in gear, idling
- He drops an incendiary right into -Bird's lap
-Bird squirms
No go
Eric reaches in with a bungie cord
little restrictive
Good
(chilling) You held her down and raped her
You were the first
She burned while you were inside of her
(re: bomb) What's the lag on this
About twenty seconds, would you say
-bird thrashes, but he's immobilized
Can't even budge the wheel
(') 've comrades in hell, -bird
Give them my best
Eric activates the timer
Yanks up hard on the bungie cord
: - The bungie cord pulls -Bird's foot all the way down on the pedal
-  , Eric steps back, plucks the guitar out as the car starts to move
The car roars for the edge of the dock, about a distance of a football field
Eric examines -bird's auto pistol and pops the clip
:  as the car speeds for the water's edge, Eric thumbs bullets from the clip, one by one
- -   - -bird's eyes bug in horror and he goes
- -    ' thumbing out the final bullet
-   - All gone
- - Lifting off and blowing all to hell, a billion smithereens of phosphorescent firs pattering into the dark water
It hits
Sinks
Weird flare glow as the car quickly submerges
- heaving the gun into the distant water
Plosh
He produces - Bird's accelerator
Squirts it into the ground
He prestidigitates and -Bird's Zippo appears in his hand
He flicks it and drops it into the flammable puddle
- walking slowly out of the scene as the firepool coalesces into a burning crow shape
'  - - of a frying pan busy burning some pretty firebombed looking eggs
Kind gross
-
never was too good at this domestic shit
- staring outside at nothing in particular
Yet
Don't say "shit"
(beat) That's okay
Corn Flakes are okay
Anything
She pauses as she hears a lilting, faraway
Across the street she can make out the figure of Eric on his roof playing the guitar
of a Pignose Amp
More soft  strokes as a patchwork a taped-together, jerry-rigged cables to: -    -- shirtless, crosslegged, his Crow make-up streaked by the night's work
His fingering is unsure and he tries the tune again
- We she Shelly's engagement ring on a leather thong around Eric's neck
Like an amulet
- He's got it right this time
Strong, sure
Passionate
We can almost imagine him conjuring Shelly via musical sorcery
He holds a stroke, letting it ring
Sun rises behind him
(
) Hey, shut the fuck up
Eric's eyes, closed with the moment, dart left
Funny
- - Later
Elly is seated on a stool
Mickey gives her a chili dog
Chili dog for breakfast
it's original
Mom tried to cook
Oh
(
) Hey, Mickey,  need a special with everything
No sawdust
(to Elly) Everyone's a comedian
Enjoy
Mickey
(
) You're Elly, right
know your mom
Elly turns
Grange sits next to her
Lao's mirrored-windowed car is parked across the street, b
g
lot of people "know" my mom
Grange points o
s
, indicating he wants coffee from Mickey
know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star
don't know you
(easily) 'd like to get in touch with him
Elly sizes Grange up
You're not a cop, either
What do you want him for
'm looking for a good guitar man
Right
Grange withdraws a $10 bill from his wallet and slides it across the countertop to Mickey
(') You buying
(cuts him some slack) He kinda wanders around
You'll see him if you pay attention
need to find him kind of soon, Elly
-   - No shirt, the ring on the thong around his neck -- workout mode
He twirls and performs odd Crow moves of increasing complexity in the big open living room
On purpose, he stretches hard against the bedroom doorframe
:  Shelly stands in the blue moonlight near the picture window wearing a rococo Victorian gown
as she is embraced by a nude Eric
He undoes the last few remaining ties that hold the gown in place
as it crumples down the length of Shelly's (also otherwise nude) body to the floor
-     - hanging there, inviting the pain the  bring
Breathing as though he is pumping iron, pumping up
-  - embracing a ragged full-length dress that used to be Shelly's
: Eric and Shelly (wearing the same dress), exchange an extremely passionate and intimate  in the moonlight
- as he drops the dress
Absorbing the pain and memories
-  - executing a complex roll that winds him up at the windowsill
He grasps it with both hands
:   series of   of Eric and Shelly's , each moving along the other's body
Curves and dips and contours
But Eric's gaze never leaves SHelly's eyes
- His  similarly
Bringing his hands away and clapping them together, deep breath, fingertips pressed to his face, like Kung Fu prep
When he opens his eyes, the crow is there before him on the sill
That's better
He wipes his torso down with a towel
(') It's almost time
He holds his hand in front of his face and he flexes it
We can tendons  like a harness
Closes it into a powerful fist
'  - on Skank as he slams his fist down on the table
He has a black eye and facial scuffs from his liquor store encounter
Top,  made the sumbitch
Face all painted white like some kinda fuckin' kabuki homo
to include all present:  Lao, Grange, Lao Guards #1 and #2, Top Dollar, and a Sentry
Top dusts up a line and rinses his nostrils with brandy
Sounds like our "Crow" is out-maneuvering you
"Our" Crow
Come now
You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims
What about your turf, Top
(mockingly) You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet
(pissed off) The night is young
(hot) The found -bird flash-fried to what was left of his fucking car
Top is angry too, but won't show it to Lao
He rises and goes to the window
Neon glow
Top sees something outside, below, that really torques him off
-  (' ) phantom   is spray-painting a crow shape on the condemned building right across the street
'  - Top whip-drawing an auto pistol and shooting below
Hey, you little fuckweed
That's against the law
His gun smoking
Momentary empowerment
(') don't give a shit what kinda bird this guy is
- As Top turns from the window,    to incorporate the chunky shadows where the lights don't fall
Eric is there, perched on the narrow exterior ledge
but we don't know it until he opens his eyes, two dots of white in the blackness
'  - -- angered by this macho horseshit, annoyed at his time being frittered
am sitting over here
He  a palm on the table and the room goes silent
Top looks sheepish
(') Do you think this childish machismo impresses me
(regains composure) When  was a boy in Saigon watched my country change one block at a time,  one building at a time
Whole lives erased way of life, polluted
Today, no one forces me to move
use my powers to change your country, one block at a time,  one building at a time
Nice speech
What's it supposed to mean
Your comprehension is not required
Your cooperation and, indeed, your ability are the issues on the table
Top rallies to this
Whatever you say,  can do
Skank looks around, nervous and jumpy, a contradiction to Top's guarantee
That's reassuring
- - '    ' from the ledge
Endstamp is for a
45 caliber
- He sniffs the cartridge
We can see Funboy's cartridge in his hair
He fists the shell casing tightly
- -, Jittery, grabbing a clip for his own automatic
What was that --
It wasn't anything
Skank loads, stands and jacks the action on his gun
Lao looks questioningly to Top Dollar
Too many poppers, Skank
Relax
Heel
- black blur as Eric arches through, spilling Top
- Eric back flips the length of the table and kicks the gun from Skank's hand
All react
Weapons out
- - ' spinning mid-air to land in Eric's open hand
-    - () Death cleans house
Standing on the table, Eric fires rearward under his own arm to clip Lao Guard #1
He pivots, shooting, and takes out Lao Guard #2 -- who slams backward into the steel door as it being opened by the Sentry outside
Crash
The door is shut again
- Grange sprays the room with a Calico 950 Auto, shoving Lao beneath the table for cover
- Bullets hit him and demolish everything behind him
Skank hits the deck again
Eric fires and Lao Guard #1 sucks three hits across the chest, firing convulsively against the ceiling, blowing the lights
- springing up from behind table
But Eric is gone from the field of fire and one shot strikes Skank, rising at the far end
- making for the door, Grange as shield
Lao draws a pistol
The door opens and Lao shoots a Sentry to clear him out of the way
- last look back toward Eric and Grange hustle Lao out
Door  o
s
Top is out of ammo as Eric lands from above frame right in front of him and slaps the gun from his hand
(awed but maintained) You want my attention, man you got it
- Wounded but clawing toward Eric just the same
It's him, Top
He dusted -Bird
-    , -- You have to be SKank
(to Top Dollar) One moment
As he speaks,   as he turns and grabs the incoming Skank by the hair
Thank of a snappy comeback for me on your way down
Without a beat he pitches Skank right out the window
Skank howls all the way down
-    - Damaged from the wreck, limping home, piloted by our pals Speeg and
Skank smashes down into the roof, imploding the flashbar and windshield
drenches his lap in fresh coffee
OwwwAAHHH son of a
-     - who watches with slow marvel from the shadows Jesus Christ
He runs to assist the demolished cruiser
'  -  - Just Top, Eric, corpses, and lazily drifting gunsmoke
Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air
Five large, in the drawer right over there
never saw you
Do you know what you destroyed
Take the dope, too
Eric backhands Top into the wall
Gets in his face, seething
year ago
very nice lady circulated a petition
She died
Last Halloween
Answer yes or no
That's ancient history
It's yesterday
Do you know what you destroyed
Top Dollar yells right back at Eric's anger
Who gives a fuck
'm a businessman
You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face
You don't even remember
never forget anything, dickhead
That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition
It got a little rowdy
end of story
Rowdy
Let me fill in some gaps for you
And he grabs Top's head the way he grabbed ALbrecht's earlier, slams Top into the wall
Nose-to-nose
:  Shelly backing away from oncoming Funboy in the loft, trying to retreat, nowhere to run, her home invaded, scared
- Top is quivering, almost helpless in Eric's hypnotic grasp
Eric winces, hard, and -- :  Shelly cut, bleeding, struggling against -Bird
Wild
- Viciously close, more intimate and lethal than anything
You're a detail man, Top -- you need to see more
This time Top tries to twist from Eric's grasp but it's no good
: Shelly, comatose in , eyes fixed and staring, hoses darting in and out, cold blue refrigerator light
Bloody, bruised and broken (from Albrecht;s memory) - - arching, stiffening in pain
- - All of her pain, Top
Thirty hours
All at once
Eric bears down on Top Dollar again
Top screams
Blood begins to leak from his eyes, nose, ears
(') all for you
:  Rapidfire -
jagged compound fracture, jutting, Shelly's eye, blood-red sclera, purpled and sunken
Her scraped-raw hand clawing at air
Icebox lighting of her monitor going flatline: eeeeeeeeeeeeee
- -
as Top sags in Eric's grasp, terror fixing his wide-staring dead eyes
Eric lets him drop like a laundry sack
didn't think you could handle it either
of impact, heavy against the steel door
Eric turns
- as it is battered down by a squad of police using a power-ram
All weapons snap up to bear on Eric
That's all she wrote, Bozo
You stand down now, and that's an order
- using his foot to shove the massive conference table at the incoming  while launching himself into the air, flipping toward the window and arching through cleanly as the cops open fire on command
Bullets tear the room to pieces
The fire escape's covered
-    - Picking up Eric on his dive through the window, bullets chasing him
Immediate police fire from below sparks off the ironwork
Eric ducks slugs balletically and scampers to the roof
- Eric somersaults over
Bullets chip brick in his wake
-
Showtime girded police cars and , Eric a distant shadow figure above
Here comes a   with a bullhorn
() On the roof
Keep firing
Keep firing
fury of law enforcement ordnance cuts loose all around him
forearm up against the fusillade
Below him -- - Here come Lead  and his Merry
-   - Eric runs for it
Half a story higher
He hits the wall and skitters up, gripping tiny cracks in the brickwork
-
Lead  hesitates -- because of what he sees
Holy shit, it's spiderman
He tries to pull a bead and fires too late
(') What're you boy scouts staring at
Let's Go
Let's go
Let's go
- He sprints to the far edge and dives to the next lower rooftop
As he lands he is nailed by a helicopter spotlight, boring in from behind and above the row of buildings
- below,  in the chopper, everyone rushing parallel to Eric, trying to keep up
'  -  , to the next ledge
right behind him on the roof as well
-
and finds a void waiting there
No connecting building
- staying ahead of the search light
fantastic series of artful moves that wind him up at the rear edge of the roof
- sighting Eric as the light picks him out
Eric glances at them
then jumps
(
/) He's off the roof
We can't see him
- - pulling his weapon off target, because there is not target
Dammit to hell
(beat; to men) Come on
-  - Eric lands like a falling safe, scattering garbage
But he's okay, up and running
- '   - as his escape is cut off by a police car that screeches to a stop, blocking the exit
- as he backpedals, scanning for an alternate escape
(from car) Come on
- We can see Albrecht
Eric dives inside and the car burns rubber
'  -  - Albrecht harried and frantic, but in control
Keep your head down
He twists and turns the car, glancing rearward for pursuit
Gradually he calms down
(') figured you might need a ride home
Eric looks up at him from his half-concealed crouch
It's done
figured as much
Did you cap off Funboy
Funboy had to leave this mortal coil
Yeah, among others
(sees Eric's condition) Hey, man -- you're hit
It's only a flesh wound
It's only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds
Eric sits up as the car gains distance
Grabs the cigarette out of ALbrecht's mouth
Takes his single puff
You shouldn't smoke these
He pitches the smoke out the open car window
Great
Litterbug of the Living Dead
Eric turns back to Albrecht
'm finished
Eric shoots him a doubtful look
(') mean, 've done what  came to do
It shouldn't hurt this much
But it will pass
(not buying it) Right
(beat) You sure  can't just take you to the emergency ward
-  -  ' It hangs a turn and their escape is made
(
) They couldn't do anything for me
(
) How 'bout the morgue
(
) No
have one more thing to do
-      - Lonelier, less traffic, more deserted
-       - You're gonna kill somebody else
(beat; no response) We're gonna stop and get a shit-load of Band-Aids
Eric is obviously fighting to stay centered, stay conscious
His last fight has caused him a great deal of damage, taken a lot out of him
He needs to recharge
have to prepare for an anniversary
This coming night
on their two kinds of determination
as we : - High blue sky
It might even be pretty if it wasn't Detroit
'   - The  flybank pulses with videotaped images of Club Trash's of various performers -- including Diabolique
On several screens, one-by-one, various images of a guitar-playing Eric Draven - as we   to the desk
Lao has the 8x10 from the corridor gallery
He places it within eyeshot and resumes work on the desk  ;  we can't see it yet, among other scattered research and inconcubula
- Entering and crossing to the desk
As he comes up to the desk, he
What
the hell is that
(calmly) This is a cobra, Mr
Grange
Yes, it is real
- Revealing Lao with a sealed cage, holding a large, live cobra in his hands
The killing blade is nearby
That thing is poisonous
Extremely so
(beat) You and  are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow
Grange makes a face
Can't keep his eyes off the cobra
Give me a break
That guy's a wacko
intend no slight to you, but cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is
suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury
Not a Plymouth Fury,  bet
Lao chuckles indulgently
Do you know of spirit assassins
You do know the dead can rise
Properly motivated, of course
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip
Mmm
But tonight  can take what is his
Only thing you'll get from that clown is a faster way to die
To the contrary
Lao smoothly  the snake with the Blade against the stone surface of the desk and discards the writhing body
He squeezes behind one of the eyes and a   protrudes like a dark pimento
pulls it free of the milky, clinging tissue and
Off Grange's stunned expression
(') all the dying tonight will be done by the former Eric Draven
Lao exhibits the blade to Grange as though it explains all
(') Who is only invulnerable so long as he cares about the dead
When he begins to care about the living, you'll find his heart can bleed
and  want it to bleed for me
Kill a dead guy
Lao  the second venom sac; swallows it
Pleased
Truly kill him
So  may crush his skull and smoke it
Lao
Grange can handle it
(') Let it suffice that  need him
and to get to him, we'll need his little friend
Finally, an assignment Grange can comfortable understand
- Eric, barechested, emotionally tapped, clean of makeup and blood but exhausted, his movements retarded and slack
Staring fixedly into the fireplace,  where he burns everything he could find of his past:  the junk from the makeup table, the masques, photos of himself and Shelly
-  - Moving with Elly as she nears the open loft door
She cautiously inside
Without looking toward the door, he speaks
What's going on
remembrance
(beat) closure
And Eric consigns to the fire the  we saw earlier
Holds a photograph in a broken frame
Cracked glass
Subject: Eric and Shelly, goofing for the camera
He chucks it into the fire
Draws a deep breath
Better now
feel good
How are you, Elly, my friend
Elly is clearly uncomfortable, groping for an excuse just to see Eric
Eric is staring at her, intently
What is it
knew
knew  knew you
Even with the makeup and stuff you wore
(beat) You really loved her, didn't you
- - The photo burns and blackens in the grate
You brought flowers
As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives
(upset) She's dead
She's gone
And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too
hate this place; it isn't fair
Elly
He draws her close
Wipes away an errant tear with his thumb
(') Sometimes the people we care about are gone, for no reason
Sometimes that's really tough
cry
But if the people we love are gone, we keep them -- He taps Elly's temple, then his won
(') -- right here
It's a big responsibility
And that makes it okay to mourn
(beat) know that if you weren't here, 'd be very sad
Elly gives Eric a hug
You look funny without your white face on
Like it's your day off or something
He quizzical expression amuses him
Somebody here wants to meet you
Gabriel
Gabriel the cat has wandered near the fireplace to join them
Elly is immediately smitten
Happy
remember him
Here, Gabriel
here kitty
Gabriel
Is he still yours
think he's yours, now
The cat seems to like that idea
Elly wraps him hugely up in her arms, talking to him: "How're you, Gabriel, whatcha doin'" - While Elly is preoccupied with the cat, Eric gives up his last bit of Shelly to the fire - a portrait photo of her, small and creased
He puts it in the fire, watches it burn for a beat, then turns to Elly
(') have something else for you
as Eric lifts off his neck Shelly's ring for Elly's inspection
The ring twirls large in f
g
Nobody ever gave me something like that before
Ever
Eric places it around her neck
Elly
Shelly would've wanted you to have it
This way, you'll think of her every time you see it
And she'll be alive
Up here
Elly  her own temple with a smile, keeping one hand on the ring
: - Blowing wind
-- wisp past
Ghosts, witches, demons out for Halloween
- walking home with Gabriel zipped up inside her coat is Elly fire engine wails past in the opposite direction
- Strictly downscale building
Elly to Gabriel" You're gonna like it here
car curbs across the street as she enters the building
- as the window cranks down to reveal Grange at the wheel
'  - Darla nervously smoking, doing her best to stay clean, but jittery
Elly enters the shabby living room with Gabriel in her arms
was wonderin' where you'd gotten to -- (she sees Gabriel) Oh, Elly, honey, a cat
Here
He was a present
Besides, we're moving anyway
You said
We'll discuss this later
Obviously
You left the door open
points
As Elly goes to close the door it opens
- Grange enters accompanied by two Asian martial arts (Lao Guards #3 & #4)
Grange looks around, bemused, his manner avuncular
Hi, Elly
Remember me
Elly's surprise is evident
Darla is just plain pissed off
don't remember you
And  don't remember inviting
(to his ) If she opens her face again, shoot her in the head
- Mouth stalling in the  position as Lao Guard #3 pulls a gigantic gun, draws and cocks
(panicked) Mom --
-  #4 as he scoops her up, captive
- He strolls the circuit of the room, stopping near the window
You should listen to your mother
She said no cats
Grange pitches Gabriel right out the window
Gabriel
Grange pulls out a compact Polaroid camera
Now that's the expression  want
-    #4 As she struggle mightily, to no avail, as Grange moves in to snap his shot
(') Say cheese
He snaps
On the -70  and flash white-out, we -- - Dark clouds have gathered to highlight the sunset
Eric plays the guitar - , the SHelly theme in a major key
Where before it was wandering, uncertain, now it's bold and heartbreaking
Definitive
Pain replaced by strength and a sense of homecoming
As Eric gets to the end of it, the notes are flying out
At the climax, rips the guitar up over his head and brings it down --  -- on the Pignose
He's finished here
- as the broken guitar   over the building edge
- As Eric comes down the stairs
Notices the open door
- He enters, cautiously, to find an envelope laying in the middle of the floor
He opens it
- with a note
- The crow flies past behind him as his expression hardens
-     - Eric brutally crisscrosses his arms with black vinyl tape
- Pulling on black night-fighting clothes, skintight
- as Eric (seen in mirror) jabs his fingers into the white makeup and smears it on
: - Eric marches along in plain view since everyone around him seems to be in costume
The wind whips his coat
bustle around him with trick-or-treat bags
The crow perched on his shoulder
'  - Somewhere, a few blocks over, a building is burning
- fire engine races past on the street
He steps out in its wake and crosses over to -- - waiting for him as he crosses to the fence
Beyond the fence, in the distance, the church looms
- He pauses
in a Creature from the Black Lagoon mask comes, passes Eric, then comes back for a touch
Trick or treat
Eric smiles
Not tonight
- Eric is standing over the grave of Shelly Webster, looking down
He holds for a moment then moves on
- Eric ascends toward giant oak doors, tres Gothique
The crow flaps past, leading him
-    -- where waits the Skull Cowboy
As Eric approaches, the Skull Cowboy interposes himself between Eric and the huge double doors
Eric glares up, defiant
Moves up the steps
The Skull Cowboy extends a skeletal hand
Stop screwing around
Angry, ready to battle:  You talking to me
(') Your job is done
You interfere with the living again
Tell me 'll get hurt
That might die
(beat) 've already done that
don't need anyone's help
Yours included
- Eric lower, Skull Cowboy superior, the storm wild around them
Do this thing and you will be vulnerable
The blood will not return
(beat) No powers
No reunion
Nothing
Fine with me
He  a step up; the Skull Cowboy Hold fast
You'll be alone
'm already alone
- Through a castle keep-like slit, Grange monitors Eric's arrival
He speaks into a headset
We've got company
(
/) Is he inside
'  - Eric Talking to dead air
Almost arguing with it
Eerie
As he talks into his mike he hefts a nightscoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle
He's just out front talking to himself
You tell me
-     - Eric, eyes steely, stares down the Skull Cowboy
Don't waste my time
Very well, it's your ass
And the wind kicks up around them both, powerfully
-   () As the force of the storm dust-devils around him and begins to disassemble him
The fire in his eye sockets goes out
His hat flies off an is pulverized by the wind
The garments begin to disintegrate and blow around, rotten cerements falling apart in mid-air
-    -- transfixed by this unexpected development
shard of the Skull Cowboy blows past Eric's face and transmutes to dust
() Transparent, ancient bones, crumbling and blowing away
- As Eric lunges for what's left of his mysterious, smart-ass mentor - - ' Meeting only a swirl of vaporous dust where the Skull Cowboy's heart would have been
- He has time to register the dust in his palm before it, too, renders down to nothingness,  leaving a vague green glow that dies
And as he looks to the sky -- - flapping down to land on Eric's shoulder
Eric is astonished
But why are you still here
- - No answer in the crow's eyes
That's good enough for Eric
He marches to the double doors and shoves them back
-       - The high breeze blows in with him, disturbing dust in the disused Gothic dark
Hollow cathedral  to sounds giant 27"  positioned on the alter, broadcasting static
-       - ("") Leery of potential danger from a thousand dark places
-   - Onscreen:  Elly, gagged with duct tape and handcuffed to an iron ring bolted to a flagstone wall
Could be anywhere inside the church
(
/) believe our friend Elly call you Mister Crow
(beat) Please acknowledge; the mike will pick you up
can see her
Of course you can
-     --  in darkness
The running lights on his night-scoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle which vague sprays of eerie red and green light
(';
/) Don't permit your rage to cloud the issue
believe in barter
propose a simple trade
Grange sights his weapon
- Bluring as Grange resights
Eric is not the target
Blur the crow at the far end of the nave, perched in front of a giant stained glass window
-  -- squeezing off two quick,  shots
-    -- the first shot blows a hole in some pastoral religious presentation
of glass
-  -- Spinning at the quiet
pfut
sound, to witness
-   - ("") SPinning and hissing venomously
- As before, but the crow is not as fast
- As it catches the dart and goes down in a flurry of feathers
-    - His knees buckle
Sympathetic  from the hit
(
/) You intended to finish this evening in the cemetery
am here to help you on your way
- Swapping his tranquilizer gun for a more lethal rifle, similarly scoped
He sights the fallen Eric in a spray of green light
-   - Groping for support to drag himself back to standing
(
) 've got him if you want him
(
/) No shooting
(into headset) Move in, guys
-   -- as Lao Guards #3 and #4 move into light, closing on Eric's position in the center of isle
Both wield calico's and one bears a sword
-  -- Lao makes his entrance from shadow wearing a brisk pugilist get-up, a practical fighting outfit
Makes a show of drawing the killing blade
wish to possess what you have now
want the girl
Unharmed
Now
know
That is why  will prevail
Mr
Grange
Eric  ,  his throat in obvious pain
- Holding the crow by the neck,
He plucks the tranq dart from the its body
- Crashing to one knee, invisibly bludgeoned, struggling to breathe
Lao has no fear, walking around the stricken Eric
Sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine Fury
And it turned out to be you
At last
appreciate your abilities as few mortals can
That's why  desire them
You're too late
There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to
But he turned to dust and blew away
(beat, gasping) don't have any power for you to take
don't believe that
Lao motions to Grange with the killing blade
Grange his deathgrip on the crow
on Eric so we may perceive a palpable degree of relief
(') Time for you to die for me
(beat) Funny, how the dead can still bleed
How they need air
Eric  as Lao   the Blade
To Grange: (') Break its neck
-     as he prepares to do dirty on the bird
Over his shoulder, we  in to the  from the first dart until we're in  - of an eye watching through the hole
-    - Albrecht digs through a sling bag of weaponry, trying to simultaneously monitor the peephole, muttering sotto to himself
Had to go get yourself hip-deep in shit, didn't you, my friend
It begins to rain
Albrecht glances resentfully toward the sky
(') Give it a rest, huh
hefts a machinegun, clipped over and under
on full auto into the Madonna on the window
- As the window  toward Grange and he sucks big hits from behind,  the crow
The bird hits the ground, flapping weakly
#3 & #4 exchange a look and whip up their Calicos, - Albrecht takes cover as a lot of religious stuff is noisily destroyed all around his position
Chunks of the window continue to disintegrate
() Eric tuck-and-rolls out of the way as we go  on Lao, screaming
said no shooting
Then he's ducking bullets himself as Albrecht   through the blown out window, the machine gun stuttering on slugs
The sanctuary comes apart around Lao
He  to the alter and  whence he came
--   just as Guard #4 comes after him with the sword, which chomps into the wood and gets stuck there
Guard #4 releases it and cross draws his Calico as  springs back into the frame --
#4 as Eric's lancing foot propels him backward before he can fire
--    #3 scrambling to reload
Guard changes magazine; Albrecht swaps clips
-     -- Guard #4 slides
Sits up with his gun as Eric, down-pew, grabs the sword
-     firing now with a gun in each hand
#4, who eats it from Albrecht's gunfire, but not before he puts a round through Eric
Eric staggers back from the impact but keeps his feet
as he tosses away the dry pistol
His machine gun jams, he fights to get the clip
-  #3 -- reloaded and rising, having caught Albrecht dead-bang in the open by the window
-   --   complex leap with the sword flashing
He lands near Guard #3 and  , blade up
- -  #3 -- screaming in pain, gaping
- looking , following the trajectory of something  toward him
- -  #3' Calico spinning mid-air with Guard #3s still attached, severed mid-forearm by Eric's devastating strike
-  drops Guard #3 -- to  Eric in the background
Eric salutes Albrecht with the tip of the sword
as he moves into the nave, which has been torn apart by gunfire
Hazy smoke
Two dead guys
And Eric
You sorta looked like you might need my help
This isn't your place
This isn't your fight
And  don't need your help
You're welcome
Leave here
Don't do this don't want you here
The hell you say
This isn't just about you any more
Eric stares dead-on at Albrecht, acidly, then  the Guard's sword, dropping the pieces and turning his back on Albrecht, who pursues Eric to: -    - The crow   through the void
Eric grabs the thick bellrope, testing it
final look to Albrecht
Don't interfere
You're bleeding, man
You can't make it
Eric shinnies up the bellrope, ignoring Albrecht
Watching as Eric dissappears from view, fast
Grumbles
You won't mind if  just take the stairs, then, smartass
He hefts his arsenal bag of hardware and begins to plod up the steps
-       --  weird perspective of speed climb
Zip
All the way to the top
-   - Slanted, shingled, slippery, dark
Lightning deep in the turbid clouds
The crow circles as Eric
Here  am
lightning  the ornate   (large, Victorian, lance-like) at the far end of the roof from the bell tower
Lao and Elly standing in front of it
Elly flinches at the strike
Can you fly, Crow man
- He stops his ascent to light a cigarette
ain't cut out for this superhero shit
-   - Lao  Elly's free handcuff to the dimly glowing  lightning rod and advances, one foot on either side of the peak of the roof, his blade brandished
-  -- Hands up to grapple, but weaponless
He spiders to meet Lao, suddenly and  along the precarious peak
Lao sees him coming, braces to strike, but Eric executes a right over Lao's head
, , sprawls sideways, clinging to the peak of the roof
Lao hurries in to slash with the blade, as Eric averts
The steel
Eric converts his dodge into a low spin kick that  Lao
Eric - to keep from falling
Distantly, Lao similarly saves himself
--   -- Here comes Lao, crabbing back toward the peak
Eric  to Elly's position,  the lightning rod and tries to wrest it loose
as Eric's hands are scorched: the metal is still blue-hot
as Eric battles to free the lightning rod
Lao closes up distance, gives a warcry and prepares to swing as - Eric  the rod loose and turns to deflect Lao's blow
The weapons spark as they meet
and there goes Elly, her handcuff freed,
--   --    as he dodges Lao by using the lightning rod to vault down to where Elly is about to slip off the roof
With the rod embedded in the roof, Eric hangs on, and elly hangs on to Eric
-- , a dark figure against the night sky, raising the sword
Face me
Eric guides Elly to the top of one of the flying buttresses
When he looks up, Lao is gone
-   -- Albrecht's head pokes up at last
Looks around, finally spots Eric below and to the left
, serio-comic
Is he dead yet
- '  as Lao's hand draws Albrecht's gun quickly
-    --Lao has blindsided Albrecht
No
You are
He jams the gun into the base of ALbrecht's neck and fires three times
-  - He's too far away to matter
Shock
- '  as it rolls down the slope, trailing sparks, snuffing out
-  holding onto the lightning rod as lightning  the night above him
--    , triumphant and a bit wild,
You've caused another death, Mister Draven
The girl will die as well -- because of you
- The base of a triangle - Lao, Eric, Elly
You go to hell, you pervert
Rage over the loss of Albrecht
He , hurting but mad as hell
toward Lao
And how many lives have you destroyed
took yours from you
Your little girlfriend
took hers, too
Your meaningless, petty life
took it so that tonight your existence might gain a purpose
You're no avenger
You're mine
Eyes alight with hatred for Lao
(to himself) You're right, 'm not an avenger
Not any more
As lightning strikes, Eric Fires his gaze
-    - ("") the crash dive toward Lao through the row's eyes
- As the crow wings down   and lights on Lao's head,
- --    '  slashing with its claws
Pecking out Lao's eyes
-- on the roofslope as he totters but maintains his climb, the crow/Lao
-- as the crow abandons him
Lao down the roof - toward Eric
--    -- Eric  Lao's fall, fisting lapels and bringing him nose to nose
Fury
Time for a sacrifice
Lao's face is a hideous bloody mask with black holes where the eyes used to be
He smiles gruesomely
don't need eyes to take what want from you
He  Eric and  the killing blade deep into Eric's back
as he looks down to see the blade protruding from his sternum
Tight grimace
lot of pain
Can you fly
He pulls Lao into a   down the roof, --  -- Eric lands on his back, forcing the blade  himself and Lao
Eric completes the roll and  Lao off  , the killing blade still embedded in him
as crashes, sliding, sprawling down  Elly's position
Gets to his knees atop the flying buttress
Sees the blade in his own chest
- -  - she sees it all happen
- a regretful look toward Eric
He  off the roof edge
-     --  He slows, stopping when Elly is in frame
He clutches his own chest
Regards his own shaking hand, drenched in his won blood
Glazed
, as she finally gets the duct tape off her mouth, trying to get to Eric
She flails and cries out
Don't let me fall
- -- their hands finally meet and
-  () () low angle   (as when we first met Elly)
Eric's and Elly's feet pass graves
Eric's pace is slow, crippled, limping
They  at a grave where elly    to steal the flowers there
Eric is bloody and out of it
She helps him walk
Now do you get to see her
Shelly,  mean
In a better place
hope
You're not gonna come back, are you
Eric's response is halting and uncertain
But he tries to give her hope
He reaches for Shelly's ring around her neck, holds it up to her
don't know if  can
But you have this
and you know where to come
You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave
Euww
Eric is amused by this in spite of his grievous injuries
He grasps Elly's face in his hands and bends, painfully,to kiss her on the forehead
For you, 'll try
Promise
Spent, empty, he holds the rose determinedly, but he's never going to make it the few yards back to his own grave
So close
His legs finally go and he collapses onto the humus
One groping hand tries to drag him further
Leave me now
- Tears on her face
She can't watch this
She  and drops the flowers on Shelly's grave
'  - Still too far away to matter
He gives it up, his face sinking into the wet grass for a beat before '  intrudes   to  his hand
No ethereal glow, no heavenly choir
just a near-dead Eric's blank-faced astonishment, and he moves forward
-  - ' She struggles to get her hood up against the rain and roughly wipes the moisture from her face with her sleeve
She turns toward Eric's grave
Then, surprised, she looks close
- ' Eric is gone
The white rose lies neatly on the top of the undisturbed  earth there
- Emphasizing that Elly is now  in the graveyard
on Elly,  in the foreground -- She walks
the rose
: '  -  () grey day but no rain
Elly stands wistfully by the window, her doll on standby
The apartment is in order and perhaps we notice a few new items
Gabriel the cat, miraculously , is sprawled on a chair, licking himself
Darla Her wardrobe more upscale, her hair done
Her manner is hectic but natural
Worktime, kiddo
First day, new job, gotta go
This does not get the expected smile from Elly
(') You sure you're gonna be okay
Elly turns from the window and  silently
'  - The aforementioned grey day in the city
-
Darla comes up
Arm around Elly
Cheer up; he attitude much more connected and loving
so we know she is clutching SHelly's ring tightly in her hand
Darla looks past Elly, out the window
At least it finally stopped raining
It can't rain all the time
Darla kisses Elly on the temple and it out the door
Elly her hand to consider the ring
She looks back out the window -- - Elly is looking right at it
Same crow
We're positive
So is Elly
It   and flies away
- An   from Eric's grave toward the tree as the crow and perches there, shucking water
on the crow
Watching
Waiting
