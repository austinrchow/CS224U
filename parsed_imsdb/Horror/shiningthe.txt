He's looking forward to the hotel,  bet

Pleased to meet you
Pleasure to meet you
Grab a chair Bill, and join in

&  sit down
Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter
would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through
Fine
Jack is a schoolteacher
: Eh - formerly a school-teacher
() What line of work are you in now
'm a writer um
Teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet
: Well this ought to be quite a change for you
: Well, 'm looking for a change
() Our people in Denver recommended Jack very highly, and, for once, agree with them
: 7
Let's see, where were we
Yes was about to explain that eh
our season here runs from oh May 15th to October 30th and then we close down completely until the following May
: Do you mind if  ask why you do that
It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic
() Oh, it sure would be : (') but the problem is the enormous cost it would be to keep the road to the Sidewinder open
It's a
It's a 25 mile stretch of road - gets an average of 20 feet of snow during the winter, and there's just no way to make it economically feasible to keep it clear
When the place was built in 1907, there was very little interest in winter sports, and this site was chosen for its seclusion and scenic beauty
: over  &
Well, it's certainly got plenty of that
laughs
That's right
And did they give you any idea in Denver about what the job entails
8
Only in a very general way
Well
: (') the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to
to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur
And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold
: Well, that sounds fine to me
grunts off
: Physically, it's not a very demanding job
The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh
the tremendous sense of isolation
: Well, that just happens to be exactly what 'm looking for
'm eh
'm outlining a new writing project, and eh
() 9
(') five months of peace is just what want
: That's very good Jack, because eh
for some people eh solitude and isolation
: () (') can of itself be a problem
Not for me
: How about your wife and son
How do you think they'll take to it
: They'll love it
() Great
: Well, before  turn you over to Bill, there is one other thing think we should talk about don't want to sound melodramatic, but it is something that's
() 10
(') been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job
: 'm intrigued
: don't suppose they eh told you anything in Denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970
: shakes his head
don't believe they did
: () Well, my predecessor in this job : (') hired a man named Charles Grady, as the winter caretaker
He came up here with his wife and two little girls of about eight or ten
And he had a good employment record, good references and from what 've been told,  mean, he seemed like a completely normal individual
But at some point during the winter, he must have suffered some kind of a complete mental breakdown
() 11
(') He ran amok and eh
killed his family with an axe, : () (') stacked them neatly in one of the rooms in the West Wing, and then he um
then he put eh both barrels of his shotgun in his mouth
: sitting behind desk
(') The police eh
they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are : () (') shut in together over long periods of time
Well, that is eh quite a story
: laughs
Yes, it is
Oh, it's still hard for me to believe that it actually happened here, but it did and eh
think you can appreciate why wanted to tell you about it
: 12
Ah,  certainly can, and eh also understand why your people in Denver left it for you to tell me
laughs
: laughing
Well, obviously some people can be : () (') put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened
Well, you can rest assured Mr
Ullman, that's not going to happen with me, and eg as far as my wife is concerned,  am sure she'll be absolutely fascinated when  tell her about it
She's a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict

What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth

' : sitting on bed beside

Now Danny, can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth
: Talking to Tony
: Is Tony one of your animals
: No
It's the little boy that lives in my mouth
: Tony is his imaginary friend
17
() Oh, : (') if you were to open your mouth now, could  see Tony
: No
: Why not
: Because he hides
: Where does he go
: To my stomach
: Does Tony ever tell you to do things
18
don't want to talk about Tony anymore
: sitting on bed beside
She pats his leg and stands up
at foot of bed
Okay
That's fine
All right Danny
puts case and stethoscope in her shoulder bag
Now 'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day
Okay
Do  have to
Yes, 'd like you to
We're just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk - then 'll come back and check on you, okay
Okay
Goodbye

Yes

points to sofa
Please
Thank you
moves to sofa and sits down -  sits in chair cam
Mrs
Torrance,  don't think you have anything to worry about
'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with Danny
: Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine now, but you should have seen him
: over
leans back on sofa
Oh  know
Kids can scare you to death, but believe me these episodes are not at all uncommon, and they look much worse than they are
: over
But eh what was the matter with him
Mrs
Torrance, most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained
They are brought on by emotional factors, and they rarely occur again
: 20
They're more akin to auto-hypnosis, a kind of self induced trance
If it re-occurs which  doubt : takes cigarette out of packet
() (') you can always think about having some tests done
holds cigarette packet out towards
() No thank you
She puts packet down on table
Oh, 'm
'm sure you're right
She lights cigarette from lighter
: Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs
Torrance
: Only about three months
Eh we're from Vermont
My husband was teaching school there
: Did the appearance of Danny's imaginary friend
: 21
over
Tony
Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here
: No, um let's see  guess Danny started talkin to Tony about the time we put him into nursery school
: over
Did he adjust well to school
: - she shakes her head
No
He didn't like it too much at first, and then he had an injury, so we kept him out for a while, and, yeah,
guess that's about the time when  first noticed that he was talking to Tony
: over
What sort of injury did he have
: Ah he dislocated his shoulder
inhales
22
() How did he manage to do that
Well it's just one of those things
You know
purely an accident, um
My husband had oh
been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night
And well Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room
and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from them
It's
it's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know, in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just
used too much strength and he injured Danny's arm
: () (') Anyway, something good did come out of it all because he said: : (') "Wendy, 'm never gonna touch another drop and if  do you can leave me", and he didn't and he hasn't had any alcohol in eh five months

24
There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times
They got snowbound one winter in the mountains
They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive
You mean they ate each other up
They had to, in order to survive

She called it shining, : ()(') and for a long time  thought it was just the two of us that had the shine to us

But there are other folks, though mostly they don't know it, or don't believe it

About the Overlook Hotel

Think
: over
Maybe he showed me something
: Try to think what it was
: over
Mr
Halloran, are you scared of this place
: Shooting across table onto  &
No, 'm scared of nothing here
It's just that you know some places are like people, some shine and some don't
guess you could say the Overlook Hotel here has something about it that's like shining
Is there something bad here
: 44
Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind
say like is someone burns toast
: () Well, maybe things that happened
leave other kinds of traces behind
: Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see
Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet
Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good
: What about Room 237
: Room 237
: You're scared of Room 237, ain'tcha
: 45
No  ain't
