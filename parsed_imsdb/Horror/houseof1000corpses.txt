"  1000 " Written by Zombie Revised 3-31-00 : -   - We see a   dancing around in a grainy super 8 home movie
wearing a monster  enters the frame
He struggles to lift a double barrel shotgun
He points it at the girl and pretends to
(
) (whispering slowly) Once  had a cat, he was the sweetest little guy
Then one day he got sick and died
My heart was broken
My whole body hurt
She continues dancing
The little boy imitates her
(
) After that,  saw things differently, everything could be summed up with three simple words
fuck the world
The camera swings over to some ugly, toothless relations watching the show
They laugh
' - We open on a dark, lonely stretch of two lane blacktop
Off to the side of the road we see a rundown gas station
(
) Hey, welcome back to 93
5 's Halloween monster weekend
'm Jimmy Ray and 'll be bringing you the oldies, the goldies and sometimes the moldies
The good, the bad and the uglies straight from the vaults
weathered wooden sign proclaims  ' , sits atop the building
smaller sign below reads
(
) Hey, kids still trying to decide on the right costume
Well why not head on down to Randall's Penny Save located on Kimball Rd
just off route 1 in Mackin County
Choose from a wide array of ghosts and ghouls, jeepers and creepers
(scary sound effects) everything you need for your Halloween needs
, a tall southern good old boy, leans against his dusty cruiser smoking a cigarette, pumping gas into his tank
' - Inside is a poorman's Ripley's Believe It or Not
Bizarre props and treasures of killers and monsters cover the dirty walls
Wax figures of    stand guard before oil paintings by
(
) Alright let's get back to our monster music marathon with this classic called The Teddy Bear's Picnic
Perched on a stool behind the counter sits  , a crusty looking old man in a filthy clown suit and smeared make-up
The word  is tattooed across his right knuckles and  is tattooed across the left
He is reading the newspaper, crunching on crackers from a paper bag and halfheartedly listening to a small, nerdy man wearing coke bottle glasses named
Stucky thumbs through a stack of autographed 8x10 photographs
(speaking through voicebox in his throat) got back a stack today
Some nice shots
(holds up a picture of June Wilkinson) See, a good topless June Wilkinson
unfortunately she personalized it
(looking at the photo) to Stucky, love June
Hmmmmm
Shit, this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it was a fixin' on trading it to Jackie Cobb
The retard over at Molly's fruit stand
Yeah, he's all hot on her after he found some of his dad's old nudie books hidden in the basement
He keeps 'em taped inside his school workbook
Spaulding brushes cracker crumbs off his paper and continues reading
Fascinating
That kid is one horny retard
Christ, ain't they all
All them retards wanna do is fuck and eat
Well, yeah
think that if you knew him
mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something
Worse than a fucking rabid baboon
Yeah,  guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes
What
Yeah, doesn't hurt himself, just spins it around next to his eyeball
'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils
Naw, he don't do anything else with 'em, but he did get caught once with a Planet of the Apes doll hanging out his asshole
(laughing) Goddamn
Had to take him to the hospital
Kid had Dr
Zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn't get it out
always loved that mute broad that Chuck Heston was shacking up with
Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman
Can  get some stamps off ya
(slapping down his money) Did you fix the toilet yet
Opens a drawer and tears off five stamps
Yes,  did
so don't you go stuffin' any goddamn paper towels down that hole
just snaked the shit out of that thing
Spaulding  the  attached to a cow skull across the counter
Stucky grabs it
Spaulding hangs on
Ya hear me
You bust that crapper and 'll beat your ass
hear ya
He lets go of the key
' - From a '  we watch through the window, Stucky for the restroom
Sheriff Huston finishes pumping his gas, gets in his cruiser and drives off
(
) All clear
Let's go shopping
(
) Right
From this  we  across the highway towards the front door of the
We  through the door
' - The moment of impact
The door  open
Spaulding's head  up to see: a masked gunman, , wearing a  +
Behind him stands a second gunman, , wearing a rubber Mary fucking Moses
Get the fuck out of here
Hold it, clowney
Keep your paws where  can see 'em
Yeah, don't move or 'll blast a hole the size of a Kansas City melon through your ugly-ass Bozo face
Spaulding obeys and raises his hands
Go get that other asshole out of the shitter and drag his ass back in here
Right
Rich exits
Miserable little cunts with guns ought to jump right over this counter and bash your fucking balls in
Killer Karl steps up and puts his gun against Spaulding's face
Alright Tippy, hand over the cash box and  might leave your brains inside your skull
Spaulding smiles wide, his teeth are yellow and rotted
Spaulding's foot kicks a red switch, triggering a silent alarm
That's what you bitches need reality check courtesy of my boot in your ass
That'll be a fucking cash box you can cry to mamma about
' -  - silent
In the dim glow, we see , a large hunched figure, sitting on the edge of a bed
The figure is heavily bandaged
Ravelli reacts to the flashing light, he  and puts a huge mask over his head
He  the room
- Stucky sits on the toilet pasting stamps on large yellow envelopes
Killer Rich   the stall,  Stucky by the neck and  him out
Come on, fatboy
' - We move around the outside of the building watching the scene inside unfold
is heard
Rich  Stucky into the main room
' - Karl grows increasingly , knocks a candy display over, raises his gun over his head and fires into the ceiling
(screaming) That's it
'm gonna count to ten and you're gonna hand over the cash or 'm gonna splatter your grease paint mug across the stateline
one
Fuck your mother
Two
Fuck your sister
Come on, man
Just shoot him
(recognizing Rich's voice) Hey,  know you
We were in high school together
Wood shop, right
Richard Wick
right
He looks nervously at Stucky
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Quiet down
three
Fuck your grandmother
Yeah,  remember Mr
Alacard the shop teacher use'ta call you Little Dick Wick
Hey, wasn't there a song we made up to go with that
(temper rising) Shut up
(singing) Little Dick Wick, play with his prick Don't his smell, just make you sick
' - From Ravelli's  we watch through the window, as everybody inside starts  at each other
Suddenly, Rich  Stucky
Stucky   against the wall, screaming in pain
We move  towards the entrance
' - Suddenly
Ravelli  through the front door knocking Karl to the ground
In the light we see that Ravelli is wearing an
In his hand is a sledgehammer
Rich  toward the
The Captain quickly a  and
Rich falls dead
Ravelli lunges at Karl, smashing him over the head with the hammer
Ravelli's clown head comes loose and falls to the floor
We now see that Ravelli is a bald pitbull of a man with badly scarred skin that is painted white and red
Karl hits the floor and begins  violently
Spaulding   from behind the counter, puts his foot on Karl's throat and points his pistol at Karl's head
And most of all
fuck you
Spaulding  Karl in the head
The screen  , then
(
) God damn it, that motherfucker got blood all over my best clown suit
Strange paintings of demons, monsters and bizarre creatures fade up and move across the screen
- We see a  painted on the side of an
The sign reads
We turn to face the road as a car drives by
Alright then, out of all of Charlie's chicks who do you think is the hottest
-   - Fast food wrappers and road maps clutter the car's dashboard, a swinging monkey head dangles from the rear-view mirror
Behind the wheel, the driver,  , 29, downs the last sip of coffee before crumpling the paper cup and placing it among the other trash before him
guess if  had to choose 'd say
mmmmmm
Sandra Good
She seemed like a nice girl,  mean in a psycho kind of way
Beside him rides,  , 30, slumped down in his seat, reading a magazine with a flashlight, feet hanging out the window
Really
Huh,  thought for sure you'd say Lynette Fromme
She's got that snooty vibe  know you dig
Sqeaky
No way, she ain't that hot
She's pretty cute
Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that  remember from fourth grade
called a
shit, what did we call her
(thinks for second) Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants
when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling
(laughing) There always one kid with no bodily controls
We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker
The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself
Better than pissing
anyway so, what's your choice
If we're talking cute
like regular cute, 'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot
Yeah, no shit
As far a hot
goes  gotta go with
Ruth Ann Moorehouse
Oh yeah,  forgot about her
She was pretty hot
Fuck yeah, she is
'd join a cult to get some of that
and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around
thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution
'll let it slide, she was only seventeen
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit
Yeah,  guess
hot chicks are always nuts
Hot has got nothing to do with it
- in a cheap skull mask and white robe stands hidden behind a billboard off to the side of the road
Bill's car drives past
(yawning) Hold on, 've heard this before
but  can't remember the end
So, the guy goes to Hell and the devil says, "do you smoke
" The guy say, "yeah"
the devil say, "great cause Tuesday is cigar night, sweetest Cuban cigars you ever had
" Shit, we really need to find some gas
(not listening) Then the devil asks, "do you drink
" Guy says, "yeah"
devil say, "wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks night, best booze you ever had
all made from the finest stuff
" Yeah
Then the devil says, "are you gay
" Guy says, "fuck no"
Devil says, "Well then,  guess you're gonna hate Thursdays
" Oh yeah,  remember now
Yeah, no shit  just told ya
(looking at magazine) Hey, you think this place called Alien Ed's  Welcoming Center is still around
It says, "Where the Fact is separated from the Fantasy
" dunno
we'll ask around as we get closer
Man,  really don't want to run out of gas out here in the middle of Petticoat Junction, man
(sitting up) Don't panic yourself, way too much caffeine guy
see a sign
(reading the sign) Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters
cool
Also
fried chicken and
gasoline
next exit
Perfect
hope this place is cool
We could use something interesting to liven up chapter 12
The car drives past
We turn and hold on the billboard
We see the happy smiling face of a young Captain Spaulding
' - The car pulls up to one of the gas pumps
Bill and Jerry get out
Inside we see Spaulding, now in army pants and a hunting jacket, mopping the floor
'll pump the gas
Go inside and see if it's worth thinking about
(salutes) , Boss
Jerry walks inside and immediately comes back out
Holy crap
You gotta see this place
It's awesome
How awesome
Really fucking awesome
Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome
Hell yeah
Jerry sticks his head back inside the car
Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey
-   - dark haired girl,  , 27, sleeps curled up under a blanket
Come on, babe
Me and Bill found a kick ass place
She opens her eyes
Huh
Grab Mary and come inside
Denise shakes a lump of jackets and sweaters lying next to her
She removes a sweater from the top of the pile to the face of  , 29
Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work
(half asleep) Sleeping
Rise and shine
(groggy) No please, let me sit this one out
(removing the blanket) Let's go
You're the one who wanted to be a photographer
resign
Too late
You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug
(opening her eyes) Christ,  hope this isn't more crappy folk art
It's so quaint
it's so primal
it's so crap
Aw, it ain't crap
it's
cute
(sarcastic) and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa
Aw, shit
(exhales deeply) gotta pee anyway
Grainy super 8 footage shows us an   standing in front of a small shack
His name is Lewis Dover
The shack is painted white and covered with
ain't no rich man, but  see the truth
You do not have to go to Hell
You are in Hell
This is Hell
All American Hell
(holds up a gun) true heaven in my hands
'm gonna blow Satan back through the door to Hell
Surrounding the shack are strange sculptures of various half- human/half-animal creations
' - Spaulding swabs up the last remains of blood from the floor, he drops the mop into a bucket filled with water and blood
Bill pays no attention, he is distracted by a strange object in a glass case over the counter
In the case is a shriveled up looking half human and half fish figure
It is the size of a small child
banner above reads: -
How long have you been running this place
How long is a piece of string
Too God damn long, that's how long
Spaulding slides the mop and bucket behind the counter
No, really
Shit,  don't remember exactly took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar
The Duke
Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that
You mean John Wayne
Hell, boy there some other Duke you know about
(rolls up his sleeve to reveal a John Wayne tattoo) great American
Yeah,  was never that big of a western fan
like science fiction
figured that much
Why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for
You see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions
You know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country
don't drive cross country
But if you did
don't
But suppose for a second you did
(fake hick accent) 'all find us country people real funny like don't ya
well, God damn pack up the mule and sling me some grits, 'ze a gotta get me some schooling
No, no  think it's really interesting
Well fuck me Side Sally, who want to read about all that horse shit anyway
Jerry  Bill's and Spaulding's conversation and joins in to help
You'd be surprised
Would it be if we took some pictures and included this place in our book
Hey, knock yourself silly
You got some really rare stuff here
(pointing to Aqualina) dig your Feegee mermaid
' -  - The restroom is gray, dingy, a single exposed light bulb hangs from the ceiling
The peeling walls are plastered with newspaper clippings and faded photos
Mary is in the stall, sitting on the toilet, staring straight ahead at a poster of  , a -  that suffered from acromegalia
Denise standing at a tiny sink, splashes water on her face
She looks at herself in the mirror
(water running down her face) swear 've aged five years since this trip started
Tell me about it
(takes a paper towel and wipes her face) God,  hate falling asleep in the afternoon
Now 'll be up all night
(stretches) ugh, my back is killing me
Yeah, hey how far do you think we are from your Dad's
Mary flushes the toilet and exits the stall
don't know
Couple hours  think
've got to call him
Mary washes her hands
Denise ties up her hair
It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate
This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal
Yeah,  hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place
Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous
know, that was some crazy shit never in a million years would have believed it if  hadn't seen it
decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap
If  never eat at another Waffle House again,  can die a happy girl
Scattered, smothered and covered
Exactly
well,  guess a couple more photos won't kill me
' -   - Jerry knees over a box of magazines labeled   $1
00, he flips through an issue, tosses it back
Bill leans against the wall next to him, sipping a hot cup of coffee
The girls return from the bathroom
Jerry jumps up with excitement
Great, you're back
Let's go
We already paid for the tickets
Tickets for what
This isn't everything
Get ready for this
there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem
don't want to see that
How about if we skip it and just hang out here
can get some great shots of this stuff
Jerry  Denise over and puts his arm around her
Aw, come on
It will be fun
Oh yeah, murder museum
sounds fun
Bill grabs Mary by the hand and kisses it
(smiling) We'll need pictures of the inside too
Alright, alright
know
wanted to be the photographer
Bill and Mary kiss
Spaulding waits, unamused
He rolls his eyes
Anytime this year, people
Alright line your asses up in front of the black door
The tour is about to begin
Spaulding disappears through a curtain behind the counter
The kids wait
The black metal door  open
They enter the darkened room
' -  - Darkness
blue light comes on
Spaulding is standing on a He begins the tour, speaking through a small megaphone
Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to enter a world of darkness
world where life and death are meaningless and pain is God
(pointing with a cane) To your left you see the infamous Albert Fish
lifeless wax figure  forward with a loud metal
Mary jumps back with fright
Sadist, masochist, child killer and most of all importantly cannibal
Born in 1870, Mr
Fish enjoyed burning himself with hot pokers, spankings with nail-studded paddles and embedding needles in his groin
On the right, notice the -ray
- - showing clearly 29 sewing needles inserted in to his groin
Mr
Fish was executed in 1936 at the age of 65
Spaulding rolls backwards and continues the tour
: a dummy face of a grizzly looking old man in hunting attire
To your right
One of our most popular crazies, the psycho of Plainfield, Ed Gein
Behind the figure of Gein hangs an inverted corpse of a slain woman
Mary recoils in disgust
Murderer, cannibal and momma's little bitch boy
Mr
Gein found special pleasure in playing with the dead bodies of women, especially their sexual organs
He was quite a handy little dandy, fashioning lamp shades, jewelry and human skin suits from his victims
Mr
Gein was discovered when the decapitated body of Bernice Worden was found gutted like a deer, hanging in his barn
: wax figure of a young man in doctor's scrubs
He is covered in blood
And now  would like to introduce a local hero,
Quentin Quale, a
k
a
The Butcher Boy, a
k
a
Nurse Nellie and most famously a
k
a
Dr
Satan
Another wax figure, of a bloody corpse,  up
Murderer, torturer and most of all master surgeon
Mr
Quale an intern at Willows State Mental Hospital, nicknamed Weeping Willows for its neverending cries of pain, took great pleasure in control
Through primitive brain surgery
Mr
Quale believed he could create a race of superhumans from the mentally ill, or so the story goes
His terrifying experiments continued until 1952
Jerry stares fascinated
At which time he was discovered and turned over to authorities for observation
Unfortunately, Mr
Quale was abducted from his cell by members of the victims' families
Vigilante justice prevailed and Dr
Satan was taken out and hanged
The next day his body was found to be missing
Some say he survived, rescued by his loyal slaves, others say they hung the wrong man
To this day no sign of Dr
Satan has ever been discovered
But who knows
Maybe he lives next door to you
:  big metal door opens to the outside world
Please exit through the door
The kids exit
The door shuts
' -   - Denise leans against the glass walls of the phone booth
Various flyers are taped to the inside: free kittens, phone sex ads and a missing poster for a girl named
light rain begins to fall
Denise puts some change in the phone and dials a number
- The camera moves down a quaint quiet little street
We come to rest at a modest two-story house
The house is decorated for Halloween
Parents and their children roam from house to house, trick or treating
We hear the sound of a phone ringing
-  - grey haired man sits at a small table eating a ham sandwich and drinking a beer
This is  , Denise's father
He stands up and walks to the phone hanging on the wall
Hello
(brightens up) hey Denise
what, what's wrong, did you break down
' -   - No, nothing like that
yeah, we're gonna be a little late
We stopped for gas at this place called Capt
Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule
- Oh yeah, yeah 've driven by that place before
seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place
- Yeah, well he's still here
think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies, you know Jerry
yeah, he's gotta see everything
yeah, know
thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner
- Well, don't take too long, the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix
know, know  forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight
got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid
' -   - Hopefully  can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home
yes, Dad 'm kidding
-  - Well, just promise me you'll be careful
alright, alright see ya soon
good-bye
- Bill, Jerry and Mary wait for Denise
'm gonna go ask him
Aw, come on Jerry
We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain
Shit, it is only sprinkling and it's worth the trouble
Hold on for two seconds
Jerry goes back inside
- Jerry knocks on the glass as he passes
Denise waves as he walks by
Yeah so
, expect us more around eleven or so
yeah,  will
love you, too, bye
She hangs up the phone, opens the doors and heads back to the car
' - know it's hard to understand, but really want to see this tree
, alright 'll draw you a map, but still say it is a waste of time
Great
- Through the window we see Jerry talking to Spaulding
Spaulding draws a map, explaining as he draws
Geez, he never gets tired does he
Never
swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me
He's always working on 10
Maybe he's a cyborg
(wearily, sips his coffee) like sleep
Here he comes
Jerry comes bouncing out towards the car and jumps in
He is holding a map and a box of chicken
We hit the jackpot
Let's roll, good buddy
We got ourselves a convoy
Huh
Ugh, what's that smell
Fried chicken
(holds up a drumstick) Anybody want some
No one responds
- An   and his  stare directly into the camera
don't know where that skunk ape sleeps
Maybe in the trees and all
all  know is he eats squirrels to survive and he had impure relations with my wife
That's true
He performed lurid acts upon me and my person while my husband Russell was a fix'n to our hound Clarence
If  see that thing again
'm a gonna kill that skunk ape
(off screen) What does it look like
It looked just like that chubby fella from McHale's Navy
Ernie Borgnine
Hold up the picture
The wife holds up a pencil sketch of a Bigfoot like creature and a newspaper photo of Ernest Borgnine
- Bill's car moves past empty farmlands
is now falling
- Jerry directs Bill from Spaulding's hand-drawn map
Keep straight on this road here
How much further
'm not exactly sure
it looks close
Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet
don't know
Mary and Denise sit bundled up in blankets
Let's just skip it
It is probably nothing anyway
Aw Christ, Jerry
We can't see anything now, it's too dark
Let's forget it
Come on, we need something like this
It could be the real deal
It's too far out of the way to come back to
What's that
Through the windshield we see a   hitch-hiking by the side of the road
It is a girl, , 27, in a worn cowboy hat and long fur coat
She is soaked to the bone
It's a hitchhiker
Way out here
Well, don't even think about playing the good samaritan, there's way too many psychos wandering loose these days
(looking closer) It's a girl
Hey, maybe she knows where this is
(sarcastically) That seems likely
Should we stop
We can't leave her out here in the rain
maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area
She looks like a freak
Stick her in the front, if you want to pick her up so bad
She's soaked
She looks like she stinks
(imitating Mary) She looks like she stinks
(makes cat noises) Cat fight, cat fight
Hardy har, har
The car pulls over and Baby jumps in
The car moves off
- Once inside the car they see that the girl is a bit odd
Whoa, thanks for stopping
been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years
Really, that's a long time
Yeah, most people just whiz on by like  was invisible or something
or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty
Yikes
Yeah, icky
This one guy stops and look in and he's got his thing out waving it around like a drunk monkey
Well, hitchhiking ain't the safest way for a girl to travel
Yeah, but it's fun
Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland
Where ya headed
Aw,  was going home to my Mamma's house
yeah,  was out doing this thing
Where's that
Couple more miles up this road
Hey, you might know
(shows her the map) you know where this tree is at
It's an old hanging tree from
The Baby   at the mention of the tree
Yeah,  know where that is, it's right by my house
It's Dr
Satan's tree
can show ya
Really, wow, so it's really a real thing
Yeah, it's a tree
used to play there all the time
But, you can't find it without me
Outsider can't find no deadwood
Deadwood, is that what it's called
Cool, will you show us
Maybe, maybe, maybe
hey, you know what word  hate
What
Cone
Huh
what cone
Any cone, yeah
(looking out the window) hate that word
sounds ugly, don't like crumple either
always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken
smile, say cheese
know  hate Swiss cheese, the holes make me nervous
What about the tree
Oh yeah, the tree
This is crazy
She don't know nothing
Baby turns her attention toward Mary
Oh,  know
'll show you where it's at, sweetie
Aren't you just so cute all bundled up like a cinnamon roll of Christmas love
Cool
Which way
Go straight up about another mile
til we hit Cherrypicker Road and turn right
it ain't far from there
The camera  through the hallways of the Peabody Mental Institution
It is
wander the stark halls dressed in hospital gowns and cheap plastic masks
Some are laughing, some are screaming
We move into a private room
Where we see completely covered except for his eyes, hovering over a We move off the doctor to a crayon child's  of a - '-
Tortured screams fill the room
-  - From a '  we see the car  down a dirt road
- Everyone rides in silence, music plays on the radio
The song ends and a   comes on
(
) This is  News at the top of the hour
Investigators in Clairemont County are no closer to identifying the body of a young woman found crucified to the doors of St
Mary's Church yesterday morning
Baby lights up a cigarette and takes a drag
Excuse me, could you not smoke in here
Baby puts out the cigarette on the back of her hand
(
) Local police and State Officials have released this report
What's that
don't know
Looks like some kind of animal
Bill stops the car
-  - Sitting dead center in the middle of the road is a The dog stares straight ahead
Long strands of drool hang from its mouth to the ground
- Why are we stopping
There's a dog in the road
Honk at him
Scare him
(honking horn) He won't move
Go around him
There's not enough room
Then run him over, he'll move
No
He's one of God's creatures, he can't help it if he's dumb
'm just crazy about animals
(to Denise) The animals have got nothing to do with it
'  - gun barrel is raised and we are looking through the sight at the car
Pop
Pop
Pop
The  fires   at the car's rear tire
The stranger whistles and the dog moves to the side of the road
- The  of the heavy rain  the gunshots
Hey, he moved
Let's get going before that thing tries to eat the car or something
As the car moves past, Denise stares at the dog sitting calmly to the side of the road
The dog blankly stares back at her
That reminds me of a film  saw once of a guy who got out of his car at Lion Country Safari to take a picture of a lion cub and got eaten by the lions
Oh yeah,  heard about that
always thought it was bullshit
No
yeah, they ripped him to pieces while his family watched from the car
The wife is screaming, the kids are crying
Some dude in another car filmed the whole thing
'd like to see that
Nice
The lions were totally covered in this guy's blood
think they ate his face off, tore open his rib cage, pulled his legs off
it was a wild scene
Things like that get a lot bloodier than ya think
Without warning the car lunges to one side
What was that
Fuck
think we blew a tire
Don't even say it
You got to be fucking joking
God damn it,  knew this witch-hunt was fucking bullshit
, let's relax
'll check it, maybe 'm wrong
Don't everybody freak out just yet

Yeah,  fixed it
Well,  ain't
um,  can't remember

Jesus Christ, Jerry
Well, technically  did what ya said
You're a real fucking piece of work
Bill stares at Jerry in disbelief
- Baby is leaning on her chin staring at Mary and Denise
The car radio plays in the background
Can  help you with something

Wondering what
Are you two gals all funny with each other
What
You know
a couple of queers
Do you believe this fucking girl
(turning her attention to Mary) was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you
like a real pussy licking bitch
Denise tries to  defuse the situation
No
No pussy licking here, but thanks for your concern
Bill and Jerry slide back into the car
Well,  got some bad news and some bad news
What
(fake Scottish accent) Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man
There's no saving it now
And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage
For fucking sake Jerry, what the fuck are we gonna do
Baby starts laughing
What the hell are you laughing about
just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching
Oh, wonderful
(muttering to herself) Fucking psycho
guess 'll try to back it out on the rim
at least to the main road
If you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate
it's easier
Just back up
think we should go straight mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right
Oh wait
love this song
Baby reaches over and   the
She loudly sings along with the song
Fine
'll go straight
What
(over the loud music) Fine
'll go straight
The car moves forward
After about fifty yards the car something hard and gets stuck in a deep mud bog
Fuck
We are fucked
Turn that fucking radio off
Bill shuts off the radio
Now what are we gonna do
We can walk to my house from here
My brother's got a tow truck, he can come get your car
silence falls over the car

, whatever
Let's go get your brother's truck
Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here

Screw that, no way,  ain't letting you go by yourself
Don't worry, 'll be quick
Just stay here, no sense everybody getting drenched

Yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down
Baby jumps up and gets out of the car
Don't worry, 'll be right back
Come on
Don't forget the flashlight, it's pretty dark out there
Thanks
No problem
Bill kisses Mary good-bye and
Mary watches Baby and Bill head off into the
Baby turns and makes a kissy face at Mary

But what about us
We'll always have Paris
We didn't have, we lost it

Well, yeah, kind of
- Jerry is stretched out across the front seat, reading a book on Freak Shows
Denise and Mary sit in the back, curled up under layers of blankets and clothes
Fuck, it's freezing
Hey, listen to this
think this is related to our Dr
Satan
Oh, yeah
Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show
It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder
Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree
It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility
" So
Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16
Why
(scanning the book) Blah, blah, blah
it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder
Says she, "criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946
" Yeah
These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr
Satan working at the looney bin
'll bet he amputated her arms
So what
don't know,  just thought it was interesting
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point
don't
(to himself) just thought it was weird
(bursting in) God damn it,  must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch
Huh
That stupid hillbilly slut
Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion
You didn't see the look she threw me
She's up to something
Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us
When
When you were outside with Bill
She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that
Yeah, she said we looked queer
Aw, get over it, she's just some dopey redneck, she ain't smart enough to be up to nothing
mean anything

- An old Gothic  stands atop a hill at the end of a long sloping dirt road
with pumpkin heads hang on crosses lining the drive
Everything is severely overgrown
Bill and Baby enter the gates of the , they walk up the main drive
Baby runs forward and begins jumping around in the huge mud puddles, then runs up onto the front porch of the old house
The front of the house is covered with strange junk art
Hundreds of dolls faces are nailed to the walls
These are all my dolls
use to like to chop their heads off
Broken bottles and cans are cemented together in weird ,   stretched over bone armatures form a makeshift roof
Glowing down from the upper windows are grinning -'- The door's locked
'll gotta go around
wait here
Baby   around the side of the house
Bill stands looking off into the distance at the desolate farm grounds
The rain continues to hammer down
From '  we see a silhouette of a   walking in the distance
The shape of a large dog follows behind him
Bill , startled by the sound of the heavy front door opening
Christ, you scared the shit out of me
Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet
Is your brother ready to go
Oh
yeah, he already left
We'll wait inside, come on
He left
Yeah, come on
Baby  Bill by the arm and pulls him into the house
The heavy iron door slams shut
- Denise and Mary sit facing one another, playing cards
Mary deals from a deck
Jerry naps in the front seat
How long has it been
don't know
about half an hour
metal  is faintly heard
What was that
What
didn't hear anything
Wait
quiet
Turn off the radio
Mary reaches over the front seat and turns off the radio
Now
listen
They sit in silence
don't hear anything
(whispering) Shhhhhh, quiet
still don't
Turn on the headlights
See if anything is out there
Mary turns on the headlights
Denise lets out a blood-curdling Jerry bolts up
What
what
Standing dead center in the road is the   of a holding a heavy chain with a huge hook on the end
Lock the doors
quick, quick
Everybody scrambles to lock the doors
Holy fuck, holy fuck, holy fuck
On closer inspection, Jerry notices the chain is attached to the back of a
Hold on, hold on
Everybody calm down
It's the tow truck guy
What
Jesus Christ
think 'm gonna have a fucking heart attack
(Scottish accent) lassies,  think it's time you get to gripping reality
Enough with the stupid voices
The brute man attaches the chain to the car and begins raising it with his truck
on the side of the truck reads
: - We are watching a scene from ,   and   are standing in the rain pounding on a huge wooden door
Knock again louder
should of thought that was loud enough to wake the dead
that's an idea
What is
Wouldn't it be dramatic, supposing the people inside were dead
All stretched out with the lights quietly burning about them
'm sure it would be very amusing
We pull back from the  to see Bill's clothes drying by the fireplace
Bill, now wearing overalls and a flannel shirt, is sitting on an old over stuffed sofa
So, you live here alone
mean with just your brother
(speaking from the next room) No
There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere
think Mamma's sleepin'
She sleeps a lot, now
do you want marshmallows
Um, yeah sure,  guess
You sure do a lot of guessing
Baby sets down the tray, making sure to bend over close to Bill
She hands him his drink and sits down next to him
Thank you
You're welcome
Baby moves closer to Bill, he begins to get nervous
Hey, um
(pointing to the mounted animal head over the fireplace) what kind of animal is that
dead one
(sipping his drink) Mmmmm, this is tasty
(scoops out some marshmallow with her finger) Ain't the only thing tasty in this house
(licks it off) wonder what time it is
Seems kind of late
Don't worry, sugar
It ain't past my bedtime
are you flirting with me
What
No, 'm was worried that was just wondering what's taking so long
Oh
Maybe
got into a crash and killed everbody
That's not something to joke about
(rolls her eyes) , sorry
maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up
Finally, the     pulling up can be

Hey, great they're back

He looks like a cross between the  and in

Stay tuned for more creature craziness from channel 68's Halloween eve movie marathon
'm your host
your ghost host with the most, baby
Dr
Wolfenstein and will be with you until the end
Aaaaaaahooooooh
- Bill stands on the front porch watching as the truck roughly jerks the car to a stop
Jerry jumps out, opens the back door and helps Denise
(looking at Bill) Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob
Thanks for coming to get us
Little brother almost scared us to death
(quietly to Bill as he passes) Dude, your chick's a little high strung
Mary is the last one out of the car
She says nothing as she walks to join the others on the porch
Her look says it all as she walks by Bill and into the house
Mary, 'm sorry but he left without me
Mary
come on, you don't think 'd leave you stranded out there
- Everyone stands around at the fireplace, trying to dry off
Look
gotta call my Dad and tell him we're gonna be late
Can  use your phone
Baby sits silently watching
Excuse me, may  please use your phone
(sarcastically) Bill, why don't you ask her
she's your special friend
from upstairs answers
Ain't got one
comes into view from the darkness above
She is in her fifties, but looks younger
sleazy white trash queen
She slowly descends the stairs
Huh
Oh, hi
You really don't have a phone
No, none
had one once, back in '57 maybe
don't know
Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more
Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr
, but we all call him
Oh, right
What do they call you, sweety
Um, 'm Jerry
that's Bill
Denise and Mary
Yeah, maybe

mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles
Oh, you ain't no troubles, no, no, no fuss
(claps her hands) Baby
go see what Rufus Jr
is doing with these nice folks' automobile
Baby slowly rises like a defiant child and walks out of the room
In the meanwhile please make yourselves at home
: Gruesome crime scene photos flash across the screen

Eat the flesh and pick the bones, Drink the blood when you get home

Gather 'round the people said, Where do you go when you are dead
-   - Mother, Jerry, Denise and Mary are all seated on the sofa
Bill sits in an easy chair
So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks
Well,  thought 'd maybe take in a hoedown
(flirting) Oh, really
(puts her hand on Jerry's knee and winks) well, 'm a pretty good dancer if you know what  mean
bet  got a few moves you ain't never seen
don't doubt that
No, he's just joking
We don't really have any plans other than spending the night at my Dad's house
(glances at Jerry) which is where we were headed when our car broke down
That's nice
Yeah,  guess 'll just help him hand out candy to the trick or treaters
And 'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples
'll bet you are
you are a naughty little thing aren't ya
was just kidding
Bill and Mary snicker at Jerry's comments
Denise tries to keep a straight face
Oh,  get it
guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween
No, just a little too old
Oh really, well  hope something changes your mind some day
Baby returns from the garage
Tiny's home
What about
Oh, he was already gone before seen him
but Tiny saw him and said he said he was going out to the yard to get a new wheel
The yard, what's that
It's an old auto junkyard out in Baldwin
How long is that gonna take
He should be back in a couple hours
couple hours
Can't Tiny drive us to a phone
Mother and Baby laugh
(laughing) Tiny ain't got no car, he ain't even got a bicycle
How's he get around out here
He walks, duh
Fucking great

Sorry
Well, even though  know it seems childish to you all
Tonight is Halloween eve and it special to us so you are all invited to stay for dinner
Under the circumstances they realize they have no choice
They grin and bear it
Thank you
(imitates Elvis) Yes, thank you
Thank you very much
(Mother touches Jerry's shoulder suggestively) You're a strange one, aren't ya honey
think you and me are get on like
(she thinks for a second) like something real good
Camera moves over to the
fades up on screen
Dr
Wolfenstein appears over the credits
There well, who knew there was love to be found in The Old Dark House
Coming up next, do not move a muscle, an artery or a vein as we venture into another creepy classic
are you ready for  , baby
- Bill, Jerry, Mary and Denise are now all seated around a large dining room table
thick mountain of candles sits burning dead center on the table, giving off a warm glow
Dozens of Halloween decorations dangle from strings over the table, spiders, bats and black cats
There is a hand-made    sitting on each plate
(holding up the witch mask) hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things
Whatever it is just do it
The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here
Really, now is not the time to make waves
Hey, 'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up
Shhhhhh
Mother walks in holding a covered serving tray
You sure you don't need any help in there
No dear, 'm fine
Now what kind of host would  be if  put my guests to this kind of work
She sets the tray and goes back in the kitchen
The sound of the front door  shut is heard, followed by the  of heavy footsteps
Mother's and Baby's shouting is heard
(
) Ma, Tiny's in
(
) Go tell him to get your Grandpa
- ' Baby is standing in front of her closet staring at her clothes
The walls of her room are covered with + photos of movie stars
(whining) Ma,  can't, 'm busy getting dressed
- and removes his coat
Everyone is speechless
Tiny is over    and weighs
He is wearing a black sweater with a big red skull stitched into it
red knit ski mask covers his face
Black gloves cover his hands
Tiny sits at the table, looks down at his plate and says nothing
Mother comes to fetch Tiny
She relays a message to him with strange hand gestures
Tiny gets up and leaves the room
You'll have to forgive Tiny, he can't hear so much
Oh
Yeah, my poor baby
It's his Daddy's fault
mean Earl was a good man
mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all
What happened
Oh, 'm sorry, it's none of my business
He tried to burn the house down, said it was possessed by the spirits
Tiny was sleeping in the basement where the fire started
don't think Earl ever meant to harm us
but Tiny was badly burnt, his ears were destroyed and most of his skin
Is that why he wears the mask
Yeah, my baby boy gets shy around new people, but he'll warm up to ya
especially the ladies
Great
thought  felt a certain attraction between Mary and Tiny soon as he walked in
Maybe
He's a real lady killer
Didn't ya think, Mary
Mary just smiles, then gives Jerry a dirty look
Well, we'll see
the night is young and so are you
oh well, couple more minutes
Mother returns to the kitchen
(elbows Jerry) Don't be such a fucking smart ass
Yeah, it's really your fault that we're stuck in this shithole in the first place
Oh, don't worry she didn't get offended by what  said
You two got to lighten up
right, Bill
Whatever, at this point all  care about is food
'm starving and got a fucking killer headache
Hey,  asked you if you wanted some chicken
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat
(shrugs) Tasted pretty good
- '  - In a cramped, darkened room we see the huge shape of Tiny hovering over a  containing the hunched, fragile old body of
Grampa struggles to sit, then slowly slides his legs over the edge of the bed
Tiny helps him to stand
God damn it,  can do it
can do it myself, ya big monkey
ain't dead yet
so don't you and your sister start counting out my money yet
Grampa steadies himself against Tiny
They slowly walk out of the room
God damn, my dogs are barking
As they move into the light of the hallway, it is clear that Grampa is in his late 80's
Grampa quickly grows tired
Tiny picks him up in his arms and carries him down the stairs to the dining room
As they move past, the camera comes to rest on a sitting on a shelf
containing a
The pickled punk looks to have a small second head growing from its temple

Oh, yeah

- The feast is on
Mother, Tiny, Grampa, Jerry, Bill, Mary and Denise are gathered around the table
, everyone, put on your masks
We can't very well eat with our everyday faces exposed
Mother puts on her mask, Tiny and Grampa follow
Jerry, Bill and Denise slowly raise up their masks, Mary hesitates
(to Mary) Christ kid, put it on
She ain't letting any of us touch the grub 'til you're wearing the damn thing
Mary rolls her eyes and complies
've been meaning to ask you, Mrs
Ummmm
(hesitates) Firefly
Firefly
mmmmm odd name
Mrs
Firefly, do you know anything about the legend of Dr
Satan
Here we go
Grampa shifts his eyes onto Mother
(nervously) Well, 'm not much for local gossip an this and that, but 've heard it mentioned in passing over the years but

It's all talk, yakty yak, like a bunch of hungry chipmunks

Satan
That takes the bull's nuts alright

Otis sets the disturbing jar of Wolf on the table
He leans forward onto the jar, resting his chin
Now,  don't know where you heard all your little fairy fables about Dr
Satan but
From a Captain Spaulding down at some museum

He tells cute little tattle-tales to sell his junk, but he don't sell no Yankee boys no truth
But something happened, right mean the story is based on a real incident, right
(mouth full of food) What are you, Jimmy Olsen cub reporter for the Daily Asshole
Grampa

It's better you go home still dreaming about your kitty cats and puppy dogs

Hey, the kid wants to know
Enlighten him
Boy,  bet you'd stick your head in the fire if  told ya you'd see Hell

Grampa hobbles out of the room
What's he so excited about
Yeah, showtime for what
For the show
It's Halloween eve and time for our show
Oh, you mean on
No, no, no it's so much more special than that
you'll see, you'll be the first to ever see

Great
-  - Billy, Jerry, Mary and Denise stand waiting in front of an old barn
Tiny unlocks the huge doors of the barn and swings them open
Standing inside waiting is Mother
She is all dressed up for the occasion
Please, come in
how many in your party
(she counts the heads) one, two, three and four
right this way
Mother hands each of them a folded piece of paper, which serves as a program book
Hand drawn on each is an orange pumpkin
-  - We follow Mother inside
Thousands of red Christmas lights hang down, strung through the rotting wood rafters
Crates, barrels and an odd assortment of chairs face a large quilted curtain
Filling these seats are
Please be seated
Mother motions toward four empty seats in the front row
(whispering) This is way too fucked up for words
(loud whisper) know the words
fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words
Just grin and bear it
That food
(holding stomach) ugh,  feel like 'm gonna puke
Jerry, Bill, Mary and Denise take their seats
Mary flips open the program
Inside, written in crayon, are the words:   -- starring the Comedy Legend  and the World Famous
(to Bill) Check this out
Well, ya can't complain  never take you anyplace
The sound of a warped crackling record fills the room
Lounge music
small spotlight hits the quilted curtain covering the stage
Mother Firefly stands behind the controls
She is smiling proudly
The curtain clumsily parts  : stage set pieced together from amusement park wreckage
giant painted plywood devil looms over the stage, surrounded by dancing skeletons and demon girls
microphone stands center stage
(quietly) can't believe what 'm seeing
know, this is fucking nuts
This is starting to make me real uncomfortable
Just sit back and enjoy the show
The sound of   fills the room
Bill begins to applaud, Jerry and Denise join in
Mary does not
(
) Ladies and gentlemen, straight from his smash six week sold out run at Tiki-Ti Club
the Stardust lounge is proud to present Mr
Sexy himself
Grampa Hugo
Grampa walks out to center stage, mic in hand and begins to speak
Hey, let me tell ya a story
so 'm hanging out with my buddy Hal Jackowictz and 'm like, hey Hal let's go get some booze and chase the chickens
fucking Hal says no, no the old battle axe at home will break my balls
gotta get my ass home
The kids stare in shock at Grampa
Jerry begins to laugh
So,  tell 'im
Hal, here's the secret
Go home tonight, crawl into bed, get under the covers and eat your wife's pussy
mean jam your face right in the bush
Jerry starts to giggle
(quietly) What are you laughing at
don't know,  think he's funny
This isn't funny, it's twisted
So, Hal goes home, jumps in, starts chomping and licking away at her pussy, she's screaming and howling
totally passes out from the experience
Dear God, let this end
Now, Hal
He's feeling pretty good, so he goes into the bathroom for a quick shave
(pauses) suddenly he lets out a horrible scream
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
The recorded crowd chuckles
Sitting there on the toilet is Hal's wife Gloria
and she says, "Quiet down, you'll wake Grandma
" The recorded crowd screams with laughter, as does Jerry
Bill, Denise and Mary look at him like he's crazy
Thank you, you're too kind, too kind
stay in your seats, coming up next we got something special for you men out there
The curtains close and the stage goes dark
Shit, 'm all for being a sport, but this is ridiculous
(looking at his watch) Man, it's already ten thirty
'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid
Negative
Shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero
Yeah, 'd say at this point all we can do is just wait it out
There's nothing else
suppose
mean they're obviously all bonkers, but  guess they're harmless
fucking hope so
The stage lights come up
The recorded applause and music begin
Baby enters the stage
She is dressed in a home-made showgirl outfit
She begins to dance clumsily to the music
She appears to be somewhat intoxicated
The vocals come on and Baby begins to lipsync to the song
You gotta be kidding me
This chick is wasted
Shhhhhh
How much is a person supposed to stand
(motioning for Mary to keep her voice down) Quiet
(sarcastically) Oh, 'm sorry, bothering you
Was disturbing your viewing pleasure
Baby makes her way down from stage on to floor level
She gyrates and seductively  one of the dummy audience members
Baby moves over to Jerry
Stroking her hand down his face
Denise tries to look amused
Jerry smiles uncomfortably
Baby strolls past Denise and stops in front of Mary
Baby pauses and pinches Mary's cheek and winks
Mary is Baby moves over to Bill
Mary watches like a mother hawk
Baby sings and dances with all of her attention focused on Bill
Baby puts her arms around Bill's neck and sits on his lap
Mary   and  Baby off of Bill
Baby crashes onto the floor
Take that, you fucking slut
(Mary spits at Baby) Fucking redneck whore
You shouldn't a done that
Why
You gonna do something about it
(standing up) Yeah, 'll do something
Baby takes out a straight razor from behind her back
'll cut your fucking tits off and shove 'em down your throat
Baby
Stop
Mrs
Firefly runs down from her position behind the spotlight and intercedes
Come on, ma
this bitch's got it coming
No,  told you
The garage door slides open
Rufus has returned
(interrupting) Car's done
Thank God
suggest you kids leave now
Don't worry, 'm gone
- Bill, Jerry, Denise and Mary climb back into their car
Don't look back, just get in the car
Lock the fucking doors
- Bill begins to pull the car down the long dirt driveway towards the road
The heavy rain makes visibility difficult
(straining to see through the darkness) Almost there
Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you
(leaning her forehead on the window) Of course she was gonna cut me, she's a fucking nut
(closes her eyes and takes a breath) knew she was crazy from the second we picked her up
Suddenly, Baby pounds her fist against Mary's window
Mary jumps back in terror
(screaming) You're in Hell, bitch
You're gonna die like a dog
Baby disappears into the darkness
Go
Go
Go
Get us out of here
Bill pulls the car up to the front gate
It is chained shut with a huge padlock
, illuminating the crucified scarecrows
-  - of grinning jack-o-lantern faces peer down from above
- Bill opens the car door, starts to get out
(hysterical) What are you doing
gotta open the gate
Drive through it
It won't work
Holy fuck, hurry up
Jerry, Mary and Denise watch through the windshield as Bill struggles to unlatch the thick iron gates
, one of the   down from his cross and  Bill over the head with a
Bill drops to his knees
Bill
Help him
Jerry throws open his door to get out
He's   into the car by another, larger scarecrow outside his door
This scarecrow begins smashing the car's windows with a Bill lays motionless, face down in the mud
His attacker turns his attention on the car
He also begins smashing the car's windows
- From a distance we see Jerry pulled from the car and beaten
The girls are helplessly trapped inside the destroyed vehicle
The scarecrows continue to pound on the car
As we fade out, the sound of a   can be heard
: - From a long shot, we see the farmhouse in the early morning sunrise
All is still
The sound of an engine starting breaks the early morning silence
Rufus's tow truck is seen pulling away from behind the house
The   of Bill's car are towed behind it
- Darkness, except for the face of an alarm clock
The time is 7:00
, ,
The alarm goes off
hand reaches over and turns off the alarm
We hear a deep groan
light turns on
'   - Don Willis wakes up, having fallen asleep in his easy chair
He sits up and wipes the sleep from his eyes
He runs a hand across his head, smoothing out his thinning grey hair
He picks up a phone next to his bed, dials a number, waits
Hi
Lieutenant Broekman please
Donald Willis
He holds
Hey, Phil
(listens) Yeah, 'm alright
but  need you to check on something for me
Willis stands, walks to the window, opens the shades, morning sun fills the room
shelf by the window is cluttered with framed photographs
+ memories of Denise at the beach,  the dog
High school graduations and Donald Willis in uniform with the other members of 56 Precinct
Donald is a
'm a little worried about Denise
She called me last night from the road, out by Ruggsville at some joint called Spaulding's or something like that, said she'd be here about eleven
but she never showed up
Paces
Yeah, if you could run a check on up that way and see about any accidents or road closing or anything, 'd really appreciate it
(listening) yeah, yeah,  know
'm sure nothing happened but, you know me like to worry
thanks
bye
Hangs up the phone
- '  - Mary opens her eyes, squinting into the light
Sunlight peers through filth on the windows, fractured by the tattered remains of rotted curtains
Peeling yellowed newspaper serves as wallpaper surrounding the window
Mary's eyes move across the walls to a painting of a She stares at it and smiles
look of horror begins to appear on her face
She begins to scream uncontrollably
(off screen) Shut your fucking mouth
She is hysterical
said shut your mouth
to see Mary wearing a dunce cap, tied to a chair, facing a corner in the farmhouse's attic
This is Otis's art studio
Otis, standing before a large canvas, sets down his paint brush and calmly walks over to Mary
He spins her chair around, clamps her mouth shut with his hand and leans his nose against hers
(slow and sinister) Listen, you Malibu Barbie middle class piece of shit
'm trying to work, you got me, work
you ever work
Mary's eyes scream with terror, she nods yes
Yeah, 'll bet you did
Scooping ice cream to your shitheel friends on summer break
well,  ain't talking about white socks with Mickey Mouse on one side and Donald Duck on the other
shit, you ain't reading no funny books, mamma
Otis raises his paint covered hand
This is blood and guts, Suzy
Our bodies come and go, but this blood is forever
(pulls a small book from his breast pocket) let me read you something, listen and learn
you listening
Otis pulls back his hand, ready to backhand her across the face with the book
She nods again
He lowers the book
(gesturing dramatically) And the angels, all pallid and wan, Uprising, unveiling, affirm That the play is the tragedy "Man" And its hero the Conqueror Worm
(pauses) you get that
Art is eternal, you get me, mamma
Mary stares dumbfounded
Now, 'm gonna remove my hand
you make a sound and  swear 'll slit you open and make you eat your own fucking intestines
you get me
She nods again
He slowly removes his hand from her mouth
Mary tries to remain calm, but starts to hyperventilate
Tears roll down her face
(whispering) Why
Why are you doing this
Doing what
Messy up your day
Well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand
than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit
Where's Bill
(chuckling) Well, Bill
he's a good guy, he's been great help to me
a real blessing
couldn't have asked for a better specimen
mean you don't know what a dry spell 've had, total block
(slaps his forehead) total block
but Bill he's
Mary looks confused, but relieved
(softly) Where is he
Let's go see
Otis grabs the back of the chair and drags her across the room towards a curtained off area
Whoosh
He pulls her through the curtains
From behind the curtain we hear Mary  and Otis
(behind curtain) Bill
No, no, no
What have you done
Bill
- '  - Ugliness
Decay
Pain
Carefully arranged on a model's platform is the severed torso of Bill sewn to a large homemade fish tail
He is lying on his ride side posing
Bill's face is frozen in a death scream
Behold
The Fish-Boy
(repeating to herself) This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real
Oh, it's real
as real as  want it to be, mamma
(grabs his canvas and holds it in her face) look, see the magic in my brush strokes
Painted on the canvas is the gruesome scene of Bill as the Fish-Boy
(crying) Fuck you, you fucking freak
Oh, come now
we're all creatures of God and freaks in our own way
(twitches and shakes) but if you'll notice
(points to a blank spot in the painting) right here, needs a little something, heh
Otis slowly puts down the canvas, turns and picks up a huge hunting knife
What are you doing
(squirming) no, stop
please, please
You, my dear worm feeder, are about to become immortalized
Otis draws back the knife
(screaming) Noooooooooooo
Otis swings the knife forward, directly into the camera
- Ravelli's clown head bobs back and forth
: Ravelli, wearing his clown head, stands by the road side waving to passing cars
' - police car drives past Ravelli and comes to a stop , 42, a big, slightly paunchy man with a big mustache and mirrored sunglasses, steps from his car
Following close behind,   , 29, tall athletic
(pauses, looks around, pulls up his belt) Well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us
Right
They walk to the door
' - The door swings open
Wydell enters slowly, putting on his best cowboy attitude
Naish follows suit
Wydell, hands on his belt, struts up to the counter
No one is around
rusted bell sits on the counter, taped to it is a handwritten note, "ring for service"
Wydell rings it once, waits, no response
Rings it again, waits, no response
(looking around the room) Get a load of all this crap
this is one sick place
Wydell begins ringing the bell non-stop
Spaulding shouts from the backroom
Whoever's a jerking off on that bell better be gone when  get out there
'cause 'm gonna rip your nuts off
Spaulding enters from behind the curtain, angry
He sees the troopers and puts on a phony grin
Officers, officers what can  do for you today
ain't fried up the birds yet
if that's what you're ring a ding dinging about
(pulls a paper from his pocket) What  need are some answers
(unfolds the paper to reveal a picture of Denise) Well, 'll try but  don't know nothing 'bout nobody
'm a guy who likes to mind his own business, if ya get what 'm saying
(holds up picture) You seen this girl
Say
within the last 24 hours
Spaulding reaches out and grabs the picture
(studies the picture) Yeah, yeah  seen her
Good looking kid, but not really my type
(gesturing with his hands) like meaty, eh
(losing patience) Hey ass clown, how 'bout some answers
He ain't interested in your love life
Come on, get with the facts
Hmmmmmmmmm
What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going
Aw, she was with some nosey, smartass high-rise kids
They were poking around
asking stupid questions
Questions about what
This and that, mostly some tired Dr
Satan bullshit
they got a gander at the display back there and thought they could solve the great Deadwoods mystery
And
And  gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row
figured what's the harm
Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit
Is that all
think real hard
Yeah, they weren't here but a few minutes, didn't really have time to get as up close and personal as  do with most of the assholes that wander through here
How's about you give me those same directions
Yeah, yeah, sure
You don't have to get all True Grit all over my ass
'll give'm to ya
you can knock yourself silly for all  care
(hands him a note pad) Enough talk, write
- We are cruising down the road
bobbing head skeleton toy glued to the dashboard wiggles with each bump in the road
Behind the wheel is Rufus Jr
, riding shotgun is Baby, dressed in her Sunday best
The radio is blasting
(screaming over the music) We're gonna have fun tonight, bro
Yeah, fun
They speed off
-  - The police cruiser maneuvers down the rough dirt road
- Wydell and Naish scan the surrounding woods for any sign of Denise and her friends
Boss, the way  see it is these kids probally stop off somewhere, bought a bunch of booze and are off getting shitfaced
hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different
Your Spidey senses tingling
Yeah
(realizes what he just said) huh, what the hell are you talking about
You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses
like Spider-man
(pauses) you know, like in the comics
How old do you think  am
know who the fuck Spider-man is
Get to your point
You know, his senses start tingling
when he was approaching danger and shit
always favored the Hulk
Hulk was dumb as shit
Aw, fuck
What
-  - Bill's car is down in a ditch, run off the side of the road
- Naish checks the license plate number with his sheet
Plates match
Call the chief
We found 'em
- small, crummy liquor store stands next to a sleazy motel
filthy looking hooker leads her customer to a waiting room, a homeless bum stands screaming obscenities in the parking lot
- The store is decorated for Halloween
Off to one side is a curtained room
sign reads " 8mm loops", sex noises can be heard inside
Baby and Rufus stand at the counter waiting for the , a skinny geek with glasses, to total up their purchases
The counter is loaded with bottles
The cashier is packing the bottles into cardboard boxes
You all having a Halloween party tonight
Now, what makes you think that
You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people
Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what mean
Yeah, yeah
(giggling) like to fuck shit up
'll bet you do
how much we owe ya
(looks at his name tag) Goober
(looking down at his tag) Actually it's
Ober
Gerry Ober, but the guys drew in the other , fucking assholes
(uninterested) Great story Goober, how much
Ummmm
two hundred and eighty-five dollars
Baby throws down three hundred dollars
Keep the change and get yourself a new name
Holy crap, thanks
Rufus picks up the boxes from the counter
He and Baby start to walk away
Come on, bro
Let's go
(holding out a flyer) Hey, wait take this
Baby stops and grabs the flyer
What's this
missing girl
use'ta go to school with her, she just up and disappeared some day
real weird
The flyer reads ,  , 18
The picture on the flyer shows the smiling chubby face of a young girl
Now isn't she a happy little cherub
oh well (stuffs it in her pocket) nobody just up and disappears
(mutters) Aliens
Yeah, maybe it was fucking aliens
- Baby and Rufus exit
Rufus loads the boxes into the back of the truck
Baby sits on the curb and lights a cigarette
-  - Bill's car is now sitting in the middle of the road
The back is attached to a police tow truck
An additional police cruiser arrives on the scene
Sheriff Huston steps out from his cruiser
What'd we here, Georgie
vehicle registered to a William
Hudley
Holy Jesus, somebody had themselves a field day beating the shit outta this thing
Yeah, no mercy here
Recover any bodies
Not yet
(inspecting the car) Shit,  wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time
That's the understatement of the year
Yep,  suppose it is
'  -  - Naish is digging around under the front seat
Hey,  found something
Naish crawls out of the car
-  - What'd ya got there
Keys
Well Christ boy, don't stand there like a prize dog dick with his butthole caught up a tree
Huh
Open up the trunk
Yes, sir
Toss 'em over here
Naish tosses them over the car to Wydell
Wydell fishes through the keys, finds the trunk key and opens it
(winces) God damn
You find something, Georgie
(disgusted) Yep,  found something
We move around the car to see the nude body of Karen Murphy laying in the trunk
Her arms and legs are hog tied
She is dead
The word  is carved into her side
- '  - Water drips down from the leaking pipes above
Scavenging rats scurry across the concrete floor
In a far corner a single light burns, a child's Humpty Dumpty lamp, illuminating -- Denise is strapped to an old wooden bed
She has been stripped of her own clothes and is now wearing a blue checked little girl's dress
Her hair is tied in pigtails
She is cold and shivering
The basement door opens, heavy footsteps lumber down the creaking stairs
It is Tiny
Tiny is wearing an orange -shirt that reads, "This is my Halloween costume"
For the first time we see the skin on his arms, it is severely deformed from burn scars
He is holding a small tray
On the tray is a box of cereal, milk, a bowl and a spoon
Tiny goes over to Denise, sets down the tray, and proudly displays his -shirt
(hoarse and dry) Please
Tiny, please
Let me go
help me
Tiny sits down on a stool next to the bed, he stares down at Denise like a confused dog
(crying) Please, God please
Tiny begins preparing her food, carefully pouring the cereal and milk into the bowl
He stirs it with the spoon
Tiny gently lifts Denise's head and feeds her like a baby
Denise swallows the food, trying not to choke
After a few spoonfuls Tiny stands up and walks over to a dark corner of the room
He pulls a string and turns on a swinging ceiling light
In the light we see a rusty cage, inside are three rail-thin female bodies
Tiny throws the remainder of the cereal into the cage
One of the bodies moves to eat the scraps, the others do not
They are dead
Tiny turns off the overhead light
- Wydell and Naish are pulling into a large truck stop parking lot
You sure this guy's supposed to ride with us
Seems kind of weird
(scanning the parking lot) Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house
Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help
Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way
Yeah, well  guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing
besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop
guess not
That must be him
- rundown gas station sits off to the side of the road
filthy mechanic works on one of the many junked cars
Two fat greasy men sit in the hot sun playing cards
Chevy Nova sits parked next to the station
Willis leans against the side of the car, drinking coffee from a styrofoam cup
police cruiser pulls up
Wydell and Naish step from the car
Mr
Willis
Yes, sir
'm Wydell
this is Naish
Wydell extends his hand, they shake hands
Hey
George Willis
(to Wydell) any leads
Well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town
closest thing we got to a lead at this point
That's it
Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr
Satan
Dr
Satan
Yeah it's horseshit, just some boogieman crap that the kids like to scare each other with
Anyway, there's not much else out that way
so,  figure maybe there's a chance the kids broke down and found their way over to one of the farms
What about the body you found
(slightly surprised) Oh, yeah, you know about that
Hmmm, that's a strange one
Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway
Fit the profile
No, not really
Good kid, never been in any trouble
Her part in this  can't figure
but  will
(wipes his brow) Christ, you know it's crazy
(gets choked up) lived through so many other people's nightmares, you know
Always cool and calm, but
but  never thought 'd be the one needing help, ya know
Don't worry, we'll find her
Let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her
Willis dumps out the remaining coffee, tosses the cup into the trash and opens the back door of the police car
He gets inside
Wydell and Naish climb in
The car drives off
- '  - on a bloody, bandaged face
As we pull back to see Jerry, completely bandaged like a mummy, strapped to a wall
His arms and legs are spread
Knives stick in the wall next to the body
(off screen) God damn bitch, what the fuck are you waiting for
Charles Nelson Reilly don't know shit
We pull back further to see Otis pacing wildly back and forth in front of his , watching
Grampa sits eating a  dinner
(gesturing at the with a knife) Watch that bitch, she's thinking about that Klugman bangin' Brett Sommers, pick motherfucking Richard Dawson
Otis throws the large hunting knife at the wall next to Jerry
He's the fucking slick jack Match Game man, mamma
Where do they find these people
- Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something
My Denise is a smart girl, she wouldn't do anything stupid, and her boyfriend, he always seemed like a good kid
'm sure there's a logical explanation
pray to God there is
Turn up this road
Where we headed
seem to remember another farm set way back off the road where the car was found
'm not sure if anyone lives there anymore, but it's worth a look
- Wydell's cruiser turns up the road to the Firefly farmhouse
It moves past the scarecrows and comes to a halt
The doors swing open and Wydell, Naish and Willis get out
'm gonna see if anybody's home
You and Mr
Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything
Right
(to Willis) come on
Naish and Willis head off around the back of the house
-  - Dirty dishes overflow from the rusty metal sink onto the surrounding counters
large cat walks across piles of food left to rot on a table
Boxes of trash and old newspapers are stacked to the ceiling
Music from a crackling radio is heard
Mother stands stirring a large pot on the stove knocking interrupts her cooking
She sets down her spoon and walks to the front door
Before opening the door she peeks through the curtains of a small side window
She sees Wydell and runs from the kitchen
- Wydell walks up the front steps
-  - Mother runs toward a door at the end of the hall
She swings open the door
- '  - Mother bursts into the room
Otis
Otis
Come quick, there's cops outside
What
God damn, how many
(watching ) What
How many
Don't worry about it
Otis jumps up and goes over to an old dresser and opens a drawer and pulls out an automatic revolver
don't know
only saw one
'm sure there's more than that
fucking pigs always travel in packs
(handing the gun to Mother) here, take this
(takes the gun) What should  do
Go down stairs and play nice
'm a gonna go 'round back and handle things like  always fucking do
- Naish and Willis move through the cluttered back yard of garbage
Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away
Shhhh
you hear that
The soft sound of moaning can be heard
Yeah,  hear it
where's it coming from
Over here, inside the smokehouse
Naish and Willis stand in front of a brick smokehouse
The thick door is chained shut
(knocking on door) Anybody in there
The moaning gets louder
We gotta break it open
ain't got a warrant
Willis picks up a broken axe handle and begins prying open the door
Tell it to my daughter
(grabbing hold to help) Shit
fuck procedure
Together they struggle to open the door
- Mother slowly opens the front door
The revolver is behind her back, tucked in her apron strings
(trying to be sexy) Well hello, officer
(holding up his badge) Excuse me, 'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon
Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think
My name is Lt
Wydell, 'd like to ask you a few questions
Questions
Well, heck, 'll tell you anything you want to know
appreciate your cooperation
'm looking for a missing girl
(holds up picture) this girl here, Denise Willis
have you seen her
Well,
mmmmm
no,  ain't seen her, sorry
She begins to close the door
Wydell stops her
Please, could  please come in and talk to you for a minute
Maybe you could take a better look at the picture
might stir up something
um
no,  don't think so
Please, just a minute
Oh, alright
guess  can trust you
being a man of the law and all
She opens the door
Thank you
Oh, you are very welcome
Lord knows how  love a man in uniform
She closes the door
- Naish and Willis bust open the door to the smokehouse
Hanging upside down inside is Mary
She hangs from ropes strapped to the ceiling
Large hunks of meat hang around her in the cramped room
Jesus Christ
Call Wydell
- Wydell and Mother sit opposite eachother at the kitchen table
Pictures of Denise and her companions are spread on the table
Wydell takes notes as Mother talks
Think
do any of these kids look familiar in any way
No,  can't say that  ever seen 'em before
(points to the photo of Bill) he looks familiar, is he on
Suddenly, Naish's voice comes over Wydell's walkie-talkie
Wydell
Excuse me for a second
Pulls walkie-talkie from his belt to respond
Over
We found one
Click
Mother points the gun at Wydell's head and fires
He falls dead to the floor
- Naish hears the commotion over his walkie-talkie
(into walkie-talkie) Wydell
Over
Wydell
Over
No response
Fuck, go to the car
call for backup
Tell 'em officer down
Right
Willis runs to the car, he gets about halfway there before he is hit in the back by a bullet
He stumbles and falls to his knees
He kneels silent, stunned
We hold on his face and watch as his life passes before him
quick , we see the following images flash by: father and daughter together in happier times
child's birthday party
baby crying
Willis and his deceased wife
Otis fires another shot
Willis falls forward into the mud, dead
Naish sees Willis fall
Before he can react a voice calls out from behind him
Hands up, bitch
Naish raises his hands
Turn around, real slow
piggy-pie
Naish turns around
Interlock your fingers behind your head
(Naish hesitates) do it
Naish obeys
Kneel
Naish kneels down
From a distance we see Otis standing over Naish, execution style
white puff of smoke comes from Otis's gun and a distant popping sound is heard
Naish falls over on his side
The scene fades to blood red
- The house stands silent in the darkness
Lightning crashes, a heavy rain falls
Burning -'- beam from every window
Smoke rises from the chimney
It is Halloween night
- - Dr
Wolfenstein is on screen smashing pumpkins with a giant hammer
It is midnight my little boils and ghouls, the witching hour
Time for all monsters, murderers, maniacs and madmen to go to work
so lock your doors and bolt your windows, sit back and prepare for a fright night classic
(lightning crashes) The House of Frankenstein
The movie begins and we move off the  to see: Hundreds of  are lit, illuminating everything with a flickering light
Music blares from a cheap stereo and    are draped from ceiling to floor
Dead center is a   standing seven feet tall, it is completely covered in paper Halloween decorations
long chain connects the object up into the rafters
This is the Halloween party from Hell
An intoxicated Grampa, dressed as  , sits in his wheelchair watching the , drinking  from an unmarked bottle
(slurred drunken yelling at the screen) Get those motherfucker
those high water bitches and rocketship daisies
kill 'em, kill 'em
Tiny stands in a corner tunelessly banging on a large oil drum
He is dressed like a low budget , in grey long johns and a black bat mask and cape
drunk Rufus, wearing a bloody police uniform, stands on a table  along to the music through a
Mother and Baby, both dressed as , dance around the covered object
Both are swigging moonshine from jugs
(shouting through megaphone) Show me, show me, show me, show me
Mother and Baby start   the paper covering from the object in the middle of the room
They  at the paper, spinning and dancing around in a wild pagan ritual
As the shreds of colored paper fall to the floor we see: Denise, Jerry and Mary tied back to back hanging from the chain, each are dressed in a different animal costume
Denise is a pig, Jerry is a donkey and Mary is a rabbit
They are gagged
Mother and Baby laugh at their helpless victims, splashing moonshine in their faces
Drink up, it's party time
Enjoy your last night
(looking around) where's Otis
Oh, he's coming, he got something real special this year
Rufus jumps down, begins to spin the bound captives around and around
Otis, Otis, Otis, Otis
Quiet, quiet, you know he won't come down with all this hoop-dee-doo bouncing off the walls
Now, calm down
shot an elephant in my pajamas this morning
how he got in my pajamas 'll never know
Grampa, shhhhhhhh
Then we tried to remove the tusks, but they were embedded in so firmly that we couldn't budge 'em
(gesturing at Grampa) Let him finish
Of course, in Alabama the Tuscaloosa, but that's entirely irrelephant
The room goes silent
All eyes are focused on the stairs
robed figure, Otis, appears at the top of the stairs, he begins to descend
Rufus waits at the bottom of the stairs
As Otis reaches the last step Rufus hands him the megaphone
Denise, Mary and Jerry struggle to watch as they in turn rotate past the scene unfolding
(through the megaphone) 'm the one who brings the Christmas candy
now tell me (pauses and raises his arms) Who's your Daddy
Otis walks closer to the rotating captives
'm the one who brings the devil's brandy
(waits) Who's your Daddy
Yes
'm the one who beats you when you're bad
Who's your Daddy
Who's your Daddy
Otis stops the spinning of his prisoners and stands directly before Denise
He drops his robe, underneath he is wearing a sewn together from pieces of Denise's father
Denise stares in horror, tears stream down her cheeks, barely able to comprehend the madness around her
Otis moves in close and licks her across the face
'm the one who loves you when you're fucking dead
Everyone chants "Who's your Daddy
" (imitating Willis) Now,  say my little darlings
(rotates the chain to Mary) maybe prancing around where you don't belong ain't such a winner of an idea
(slaps Mary across the face) Slowly turns the chain to face Jerry
And you, the great rusher of fools, what were you after
(slaps Jerry) Huh, speak to me
(slaps him again) Oh, that's right, Dr
Satan
everybody got to know about Dr
Satan, Jesus Christ, let the old dog rest for fuck sake, he's already got one foot in the grave and the other's tap dancing around the edge
(gets nose to nose with Jerry) well,  can see the disappointment on your sad little puppy face
so 'm gonna do you a favor, a big, big favor
You owe me, boy
'm gonna let you meet the old bastard
That's a horse's ass alright,  told you
Jerry's eyes widen in fear
Baby, roll that old love machine over here, so this boy can meet his hero
Baby rolls Grampa over to Jerry
(lifts his skin mask) You see it's all true, the boogieman is real and you found him
(Jerry stares in shock) why so sad
Isn't this what you begged for
There he is, the living legend himself, ta da Dr
Satan
Now, don't get shy on me
ask your hero some questions, don't blow this last in a lifetime opportunity
Zarkoff,  will conquer the sea, the air, the earth
the universe
Mother moves in close to Jerry
Look at the way he lights up
Grampa just loves meeting his fans
Otis grabs Jerry's cheeks and makes his face move like a ventriloquist dummy, provides Jerry's voice
Aw gee whiz, 'm so excited really think you're the coolest
you're tops on the playground, cooler than the Fonzie
Baby grabs Mary and does the same ventriloquist routine
Oh, oh pick me, pick me
have a question
Baby rotates Mary around to where Gramps is seated
(squeezing Mary's face, hard) was wondering Mr
Satan sir, do you like to kiss on the first date or is that considered slutty
What the fuck are you saying
Who the hell is talking to me
Tiny, growing restless, begins banging on his metal drum
-  -
Rufus joins in, clapping his hands
Come on, my babies are getting restless
Dump in the pit, dump in the pit, dump in the pit
Mother, Baby, Grampa join in chanting with Rufus
Alright, alright
Cut 'em down, it's time they get what they came here for
- The rain pounds down
heavy fog hovers over the dense growth of the field
In the distance, silhouetted by moonlight, a gruesome caravan slowly moves through the night
Otis, lantern in hand, leads the way
Followed by Baby and Mother together under a large black umbrella
Next Rufus holds the leash connected to Jerry, Denise and Mary
Bringing up the rear, Tiny, shotgun focused on the prisoners, and Grampa
Grampa is strapped to Tiny's back like a child
He waves a flashlight back and forth like a search beam
The group comes to a halt at a huge wooden structure
(handing Baby the lantern) Hold this
Point it over here
Baby directs the light at Otis
We see that he is trying to unlock a huge padlock attached to an iron door embedded in the base of the wooden structure
Otis unlocks the door and swings it open
He reaches down into the blackness and pulls up an iron hook and wench, attached to the hook is a chain
Otis parts a section of the overgrown grass next to the pit to reveal a rusty metal crank
He begins to turn the crank
Slowly, from out of the pit, rises a coffin hanging from the end of the chain
Otis pulls the coffin over and lays it flat on the ground
He flips open the lid
Hey happy-boy, step your ass up here
Rufus cuts loose Jerry, but holds him steady by the neck
Take his gag out, it's more fun with the screaming
Yeah,  like the screaming too
it's so much more exciting
Rufus cuts loose the gag
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us
(imitating Jerry) Please don't kill us, please don't kill us
Bitch, shut your mouth and get your shit in the box
Let us go, please
let the girls go
(imitating Jerry) Let us go, please
let the girls go
Otis pulls out a gun and points it at Jerry
Get in
now
Wait,  want to say good-bye
Mother grabs Jerry by the collar and gives him a big kiss
Bye sweety, we could of been great together
Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody
Aw, honey you know  can't do that
We won't tell anybody
Otis cocks the pistol
Jerry starts to slowly move towards the coffin
Christ, ain't this fucking a hoot
alright mamma,  ain't got all fucking night
Please, please this is insane
You can't do this
Rufus pushes Jerry into the coffin
It is and  can
next
Denise starts kicking and fighting with Rufus
Rufus tries to hold her steady, when suddenly Mary breaks free and starts to run
(laughs and raises his pistol) Where's she think she's a gonna get to
She's gonna run all the way home
No
Let me get her
(turns to Mother) Ma, Otis is having all the fun
can  get her
That's true, Otis
not that we're having a bad time, but
(rolls his eyes) Well, go get her
Baby jumps with excitement and runs off across the field after Mary
Mary trips and falls over a small gravestone
She gets up and stumbles back into a wooden cross
She tears the gag from her mouth and gasps for air
(
) There once was a woman who lived with her daughter in a cabbage garden
Mary turns toward the voice but sees nothing but wooden crosses
She is in a homemade cemetery
(
) along came a rabbit and ate up all the cabbages
The woman said
Mary turns 360 degrees, but finds nothing
(
) "Go into the garden and drive out the rabbit"
Mary is hit from behind, she falls forward
Baby on top of her and sits on her back
Baby is holding a large hunting knife
"Shoo
Shoo
" said the maiden
Mary screams in pain, as Baby  the knife into her
Baby  Mary again and again and again
Mary lets out a long gurgling scream, then goes silent
"Come maiden," said the rabbit
(leans down) sit on my tail and go with me to my rabbit hutch
Baby, covered in blood, licks the knife clean
- Otis shoves Denise into the coffin with Jerry and locks the lid shut
Through a -  in the coffin we see them crushed together
Rufus  the coffin into the pit
Once the coffin is inside Otis slams the door shut
Otis opens a small window in the door and lowers in a lantern and a small tape recorder playing music
- Enter Hell
The dim light of the lantern shines off the slimy wet filth of the rotted wood walls
The stench of death and decay hangs heavy in the thin air
Denise and Jerry, cold and shivering, hang half submerged in thick maggot infested sludge
Bits of animal and human skeletons float in the muck, broken bones lay in piles along the walls
- Through the dim light, we see the tightly packed forms of Jerry and Denise
(hysterical) We've got get out of here, we got get out of here
Think, think
Try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood
(crying) can't
can't move my arms hurt so much
know, but we can make it out of here
We can do it
Boom
is heard against the side of the coffin
That was good babe, just keep doing that
, ,
That's not me
didn't
'm not doing that
Someone is out there
(shouting) help, we're in here
Help, help us
Suddenly, an arm breaks through the side of the coffin
Another smashes through the top of the lid
The coffin begins to violently shake
Denise screams
Another reaches through, grabbing her feet
The coffin is ripped apart and Jerry is pulled away from the destruction
He lets out a quick scream before disappearing into the darkness
Jerry
Jerry
Jerry
-  - The spastic light of  static strobes across the sleeping face of Grampa
Beside him, Mother sleeps peacefully
- The rain has stopped
Tiny opens the doors to the barn
He goes inside
He exits a few moments later, dragging a huge wooden stake
He sets the stake down carefully and closes the barn doors
He then picks up the stake and drags it away
- Behind the farmhouse is a camouflage jungle, an intricate system of ropes and netting is strung together to hide the many automobiles beneath
Rufus moves through the jungle
He stops and begins to remove the netting from a car, it is Wydell's police cruiser
He climbs inside the car, puts on Wydell's policeman's hat and starts the engine
He drives off
- Rufus is driving like a maniac through the open farmland
He turns on the overhead flashing lights
- The police cruiser twists and turns in the barren fields
- Denise stands knee deep in the sludge
Broken bits of the coffin's remains are scattered around her
Jerry please answer me
soft moaning sound is heard coming from the other end of the pit
Jerry
(moving slowly forward) is that you
Denise cautiously makes her way to the bend at the end of the tunnel
As she approaches, the moaning sound gets louder
She turns the corner to see: in filthy hospital gowns hunched over a shadowy object
Denise gasps
They turn towards Denise, revealing the partially devoured dead body of Jerry
The two bone-white ghouls are dripping with Jerry's blood, they stare at Denise, then return to their prey
Denise screams in horror and runs, turning down another twist in the underground maze
She turns the corner and runs straight into
The ghouls are of the same deathly white complexion, hair-less with flaked, cracking skin
Their yellow eyes shine in the darkness
They reach for her, but she breaks free and continues to run into the endless stretch of tunnels before her
- Primitive wooden crosses form a circle around a burnt piece of land, approximately twenty feet in diameter
Laying flat in the center is the large stake, Mary's body is draped across it
Tiny is securing her to the stake with rope
- Through the windshield, we see Baby jumping and dancing in the fields with several large dogs
She is firing a gun as she dances
- Baby sees the car and raises her gun
She aims it at the car driver
She waits, as the car gets closer she sees the face of Rufus behind the wheel
She lowers the gun and begins to laugh
The car stops and Baby climbs into the passenger's seat
The car drives off
- Tiny lifts the stake with Mary firmly strapped in place
He implants it into the ground
Her body hangs like a doll
Tiny opens a gasoline can and begins splashing gas onto the stake
- Otis, face painted like a  and wearing a priest's robe, walks solemnly through the tall grass
- Denise, waist high in sludge, wanders lost through the endless tunnels of the pit
In the distance she hears high pitched animal sounds
rises up from the sludge behind Denise
It stands silent
It reaches out a   with long curled fingernails and grabs her hair
Denise screams and tries to pull away
The ghoul grabs her with his other hand and pulls her closer,  at her face
Denise fights her way free, but loses her footing and falls backwards, slipping under the sludge
She quickly resurfaces and starts to run
- Otis stands in front of the bound Mary, holding a pumpkin
Otis places the pumpkin over Mary's head
Tiny stands behind him holding a lit torch
- The police car drives wildly through the fields
- Baby motions to Rufus to steer the car towards the fire
- beaten Denise struggles down a long tunnel
She gets to the end to find that it is a dead-end
Behind her, move silently towards her, blocking her only exit
The ghouls slosh through the muck, moving in closer
Denise frantically looks for an escape, nailed into the wall next to her are planks of wood forming a ladder
The ghouls are only a few yards away
Denise climbs up the ladder
They move in, clawing at her legs and feet, trying to pull her down
Denise digs at the wood and mud ceiling above her, trying to break free
Denise is bleeding severely from the chunks of flesh being torn from her legs
She digs wildly at the ceiling, suddenly a board falls free and mud rains down to reveal: , the sky above shines through the hole
Denise smashes her fists at the rotted wood planks, pulling free another piece
With all her might Denise grabs hold and pulls herself up through the opening
- Denise fights her way through the earth and pulls her body up into the night air
The cool air rushes to her lungs
She crawls free of the hole, gasping for air
She is safe
Suddenly
ghoul has broken through the surface
He grabs Denise by the leg and begins to pull her back into the hole
Denise screams and begins kicking violently at the ghoul
She breaks and crawls from the ghoul's reach
- Rufus and Baby have pulled the police cruiser up by the stake
Rufus and Baby stand on the hood
Otis finishes his sermon, he raises his arm
Tiny raises the torch
Otis drops his arm, signaling Tiny
Tiny throws the torch onto the stake
The stake ignites into a huge
- Denise pulls herself to her feet and begins to run
The flaming object burns in the distance behind her
Denise stumbles toward the road on two badly injured legs
- Rufus, Tiny and Baby jump up and down in celebration, smashing the police car
Otis stands transfixed by the flames before him
- Denise makes her way out onto the road
No cars are in sight
In the distance headlights break through the darkness
Denise stands in the middle of the road
The  comes into view, it is a small cube truck
Denise stands in the headlights, waving her arms for it to stop
The truck comes to a halt
She runs toward the passenger's side door and climbs in
- Behind the wheel of the truck is Captain Spaulding
Denise is shaking from shock
Go, go
Drive
drive
Hold on, girly, what's the problem
(becoming hysterical) Murdering
blood and Jerry
(starts to cry uncontrollably) monsters
got away
Well,  don't see what the fuck you're getting at, but  got some friends that live just up this road
Starts to turn the truck up the road back towards the farmhouse
(screaming) No
No, that's it
that house is
(tries to open the truck door) gotta get out,  gotta get out
Boom
The metal door leading to the back of the truck slides open
Ravelli grabs Denise and pulls her back into the back of the truck
The metal door shuts
- The truck quietly turns onto the dirt road leading up to the farmhouse
The jack-o'-lanterns still burn in the windows, grinning their evil grin
