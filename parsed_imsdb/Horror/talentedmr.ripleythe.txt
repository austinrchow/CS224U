'
Fade up on Ripley, as in the final scene of the film, sitting, desolate in a ship's cabin
The camera rotates around his face, which begins in light and ends in darkness
(/) If  could just go back
If  could rub everything out
Starting with myself
Starting with borrowing a jacket
Ripley is at the piano, accompanying , a young soprano
begin
() Ah, such fleeting paradise such innocent delight to love, be loved, a lullabye, then silence
The song finishes
Applause
They're the entertainment at a cocktail party to celebrate a silver wedding anniversary
Some partygoers congratulate Fran on her performance distinguished looking man, pushing his wife in a wheelchair, approaches Ripley, offers his hand
Most enjoyable
Herbert Greenleaf
Tom Ripley
Thank you, sir
(pointing at Ripley's borrowed jacket) see you were at Princeton
Then you'll most likely know our son, Dick
Dickie Greenleaf
We couldn't help noticing your jacket
Yes
Class of '56
(hesitating) How is Dickie
Fran, Ripley, Mr and Mrs Greenleaf and others emerge from an elevator
Emily talks to Fran, Herbert to Ripley
(to Fran) hope you'll come and see us
That's very kind
Both of you
Of course, Dickie's idea of music is Jazz
He has a saxophone
To my ear Jazz is just noise, just an insolent noise
Ripley shakes hands with Herbert Greenleaf as he gets into his Rolls Royce
They are making an appointment
Ripley crosses the street to Fran, pecks her cheek
She hands him his share of their fee
Gotta run
'm so late
(he hands Fran's boyfriend the jacket he's been wearing) Thanks for the jacket
Sure
Thanks for filling in for me
From Greenleaf's point of view he sees a couple embracing
Darling couple, aren't they
Yes
An exceptional young man
From another vantage point Ripley hurries on as Fran gets into her boyfriend's car
piano quartet starts up
Ripley runs past the droves of arriving concert-goers and heads for the theater
Music continues
' ,
The interval :  thick mass of men in tuxedoes grooming themselves at the basins
Ripley turns on faucets, offers towels, brushes off dandruff
Men talk over, round, and through him
Put coins in a bowl
The concert continues
Ripley peers through the curtain at the performances
haughty woman in the box turns round and he closes the curtain
1:30
An empty auditorium
Ripley plays Bach in the blue ghostlight
caretaker emerges from his rounds, flips on the house lights
Ripley jerks up from his playing, waves apologetically
Sorry, sorry
know
Sorry
,
Greenleaf and Ripley walk through one of the drydocks huge void in the shape of a boat, swarming with workers preparing the shell of a new liner
If Central Park is where the money is spent, this is clearly where it's made
And a lot of it
Workers nod deferentially to the man with his name over the buildings behind them
Mongibello
Tiny place
South of Naples
Marge, his uh, the young lade is supposedly writing some kind of book
God knows what he does
By all accounts they spend the whole time on the beach
Or his sailboat
That's my son's talent, spending his allowance
Ripley, in his green corduroy jacket the very model of a sober young man, listens attentively
(cont'd) Could you ever conceive of going to Italy, Tom, persuade my son to come home
(Ripley looks doubtful) 'd pay you
'd pay you 1000 dollars
've always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but
Good
Now you can go for a reason
' ,
vinyl  revolves in close up An exuberant and mysterious  is scat singing
Wild
Then the sound slides into a raucous big band jazz number:  Dizzy Gillespie's The Champ ejects the record
When the camera finds the man's face it is He's hot
He's wearing an undershirt
He's trying to identify the recording
(/) don't know
Count Basie
Duke Ellington
don't know
Count Basie
The man pulls of the blindfold, examines the record cover of the disc he's been trying to learn, needs to put on glasses to do so, is irritated by his mistake
He ejects the record
pile of other jazz records are strewn across a cluttered table which includes classical sheet music and a paper keyboard
One hand idly mimes at the keys
'
Another song for Ripley to identify is on the gramophone
Chet Baker's My Funny Valentine Signs everywhere of packing
suitcase
Books about Italy
Ripley paces in this room, which is bathroom, kitchen, living room and bedroom all in one
Tiny, tidy, squalid and sad
The windows give onto bars and a wall
Don't even know if this is a man or a woman
There's a violent row going on in the room above his head
He flinches
'
Ripley, shining his shoes, packing almost done, is testing himself on another piece of music
Free jazz saxophone: Charlie Parker's Koko He listens hard, recognizes the track
That's Charlie Parker
Bird
He skips over to the gramophone, checks the record
He's right, he smiles
'
Ripley studies an old photograph of Dickie Greenleaf in a Princeton Yearbook
He shoves the book in a bag, picks up his suitcase and takes a last look around the dingy apartment before closing the door behind him
'
Ripley hauls his luggage up the stairs and into the sunlight
He is met at the top of the stairs by Mr Greenleaf's chauffeur
Here
'll take that
Thanks
(nodding towards the apartment) That thousand bucks should come in handy
Yes, sir
(interupts Ripley, who is about to open the car door) 'll get that
Thanks
(as he holds open the door for Ripley) Sir
(Ripley laughs excitedly) You're gonna have a great trip
Mr Greenleaf is personal friends with the Cunard people
'
Ripley luxuriates in the back of the Greenleaf limousine
He opens up an envelope he's carrying with Greenleaf stationery
Inside a First Class Cunard Ticket, some traveler's checks and dollars
can tell you
The Greenleaf name opens a lot of doors
,
The liner leaves New York en route to Italy
,  &
Brilliant sunshine
The Queen Mary has just docked
Passengers can be seen disembarking through the huge windows
Coming from the First Class gangways they are greeted, escorted, fussed over into the hall
Their bags have been unloaded ahead of them, and are now being sorted in the hall under the initials of their owners are dotted about, and trunks and suitcases of all shapes and sizes form small hills around them
Ripley enters and an Italian Porter approaches, wants his name
Ripley
Ripley
Ripley
he repeats in the hubbub and joins the crowd around the letter striking young woman () is nearby
She notices him
Ripley proceeds to the Customs area, where he's held in a line as a large suitcase is opened and searched
Meredith catches up with him
Her luggage a mountain next to his
What's your secret
Excuse me
No, it's just - you are American, aren't you
- no,  just,  have so much luggage, and you're so, uh, streamlined
It's humiliating
Ripley shrugs
Now they're opening a second case of the passenger ahead
Hard not to converse
(cont'd) 'm Meredith, by the way
Meredith Randall
Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf
Hello
Hello
They are passed through immigration, head down the long stairs towards the street
Meredith catches up with Ripley
(cont'd) You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's
(thinking quickly) Trying not to be
Trying to jump ship
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile
It's just - upstairs - weren't you under the stand
thought saw you there
My father wants me in New York
He builds boats
'd rather sail them
travel under my mother's name
Which is
Emily
(Meredith's bewildered) Just kidding
The funny thing is, 'm not Randall either
'm Logue
(nods, recognizing the name) As in the
As in the Textile Logues
Trying to shrug off the dress
travel under my mother's name, too
Randall
Right
They've arrived at a crossroads on the stairs - graphic signs explain the choices: one way for Buses, Taxis and exits - the other for Trains: , , They're going in different directions
(cont'd) (offering her hand) So - partners in disguise
(looks at the signs) Bye
rolls around a coastal road cut into the side of a cliff, mountain above, blue sea below
Ripley sits surrounded by teeming life
The bus slows at a new town
People get off
/
Later, the day ending
Ripley looks out as they continue on their journey
Arriving at a small fishing port they wind down through a square, passing the local church
, '
And then the bus is in the heart of a wharf
On one side there's evidence of the fisherman's life, nets, old men working
Opposite there's a tiny cafe spilling out onto the street, young guys hang out, play table football, lounge on their Vespas
The Driver chants - Ripley gets out, lugging his cases, as the bus continues on its way
He looks around him
He feels completely foreign
/
has slid into his view, now drops anchor, drops the sail
couple dive off and swim towards shore
, who's watching the events through binoculars from his tiny balcony in the Miramare Hotel
An Italian Vocabulary Book is perched on his knees and, during this, he continues his study, mouthing the Italian words
(looking at a long, lean girl about to dive) La fidanzata a una faccia
The fiancEe has a face
La fidanzata e Marge
Her partner,  , dives too
They're brown, beautiful, perfect
Ripley notices the name of the boat: ""
(cont'd) Questo e la mia faccia
The golden couple emerge from the sea
Dickie shakes off the water, grins
(cont'd) This is my face
He double-checks himself with the vocabulary book
(cont'd) Questa
e la mia faccia
Questa e la faccia di Dickie
Ripley emerges from one of the beach cabins, and stands on the edge of the sand on a wooden walkway
He's wearing -
He loathes beaches
couple of boys turn laconically and watch him
Ripley puts on his shoes and scurries to the sea
He feels ridiculous, his skin alabaster against the brown bodies
Finally, the shame is too great and he pulls off his shoes and dashes to the water, where he luxuriates in the coolness of it before wading out of the sea, and walking straight up to Dickie
Dickie Greenleaf
Dickie squints at Ripley, who holds his shoes, lamely
Who's this
It's Tom
Tom Ripley
We were at Princeton together
Okay
(he sits up) And did we know each other
Well,  knew you, so  suppose you must have known me
(to Marge) Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog
(to Ripley) This is Marge Sherwood
Tom - sorry, what was it
Ripley
Hullo
How do you do
How do you do
What are you doing in Mongi
Nothing
Nothing much
Passing through
(finds this idea absurd) Passing through
You're so white
Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge
Gray, actually
It's just an undercoat
(Marge laughs) Say again
You know, a primer
That's funny
He shares some intimacy with Marge, makes her laugh
Ripley stands as they wrestle around him
Marge looks up
You should come and have lunch with us, before you go - Dickie
Sure
Any time
And be careful in the sun
Your gray's in danger of turning a little pink
Thanks
Well, a coincidence
Church Bells ringing
Dickie, dressed in shorts, comes bumping up the cobbled path towards the square on his
He stops by a steep flight of steps
, a book in hand, unseen, walking up a hill, catches all this and, intrigued, watches as a young Italian beauty, , has a spikey, flirtatious exchange with Dickie, then climbs on the scooter, behind him
've been looking for you everywhere
Ah, today you're looking for me
And where have you been the rest of the week
Pig
With your American girl
hate you, you know
What
hate you
And  watches them as they rattle down the hill towards the sea
'
Dickie appears in Marge's garden, the sea behind his head
Marge is sitting at her outside table surrounded by some of the remnants of lunch
Dickie's sheepish, showered, late
Sorry, sorry, sorry
know, 'm late, 'm a swine
Did you forget where  live
It's four o'clock
just woke up
'm sorry
You just woke up
Fausto and  - we took the boat out, we were fishing, and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing
Well, we ate everything without you
We
Yes, Tom Ripley's here
As Ripley appears with the tray to collect more dishes
Who
Oh, Tom, hello, how are you
We thought you'd disappeared
We were going to send out a search party
No, still here
Tom was telling me about his trip over
Made me laugh so much  got a nosebleed
Is that good
Shut up
Marge flicks him with a napkin
They start to wrestle, excluding Tom
'm intruding
Can you mix a martini
(hesitant) Sure
(going inside) 'll do it
make a fabulous martini
Everybody should have one talent
(to Ripley) What's yours
(without a beat) Forging signatures
Telling lies
Impersonating practically anybody
(enjoying this banter) That's three
Nobody should have more than one talent
Okay, do an impression
Now
Okay
Wait a minute
Talent - (his voice ages, his face changes) The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance
(absolutely thrown) What
What's this
like to sail, believe me,  love to sail
Instead  make boats and other people sail them
(incredibly impressed) Stop
It's too much
You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up
(relishing it) Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise
feel like he's here
Horrible
Like the old bastard is here right now
That's brilliant
How do you know him
met him in New York
Marge
You've got to hear this
(returning with the drinks) What
What
Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st
Pleasure to meet you, Dickie's made a fine catch
know Emily thinks so
What's going on
Uncanny
don't get it
Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back
What
'd pay you
If you would go to Italy and persuade my son to come home
'd pay you $1000
/
christening is over and now the whole village is pouring out of Church for the Passeggiata in Sunday best
Girls arm in arm parade
Boys arm in arm evaluate
New babies are compared and fussed over
Old people smoke, talk, shrug
Dickie is walking with Ripley, seething about his father's scheming
'm never going back
To actually hire somebody to come all the way here to drag me back home - got to be insane, hasn't he
comes out of church arm in arm with a man, her fiancee, as part of a foursome which includes Dickie's pal Silvana's eyes flick towards Dickie, otherwise there's no acknowledgement as they all greet each other
Dickie introduces Tom, then they move on
(cont'd) 'm never going back
No,  think your mother, her illness - It's got nothing to do with my mother
She's had leukemia for -
This is what makes me boil about him
wants me back
- it's got nothing to do with my mother
don't know, Dickie, 'm just telling you what  - (interrupting) Go back
Go back to New York or call him if you can find a telephone that works, and tell him wild horses wouldn't drag me back to him or his shipyard
' ,
Ripley appears, with his meagre luggage at Dickie's front door
He's carrying his tote bag under his arm, the bottom of which seems to be unstitched and held together only by his fingers
Marge is on the terrace, she looks down to see Tom talking with Dickie
Hi Tom
(looks up) Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye
'll come down
(to Ripley) Did you speak to my father
You were right about the telephones
There are no lines, there's some problem
(coming out of the front door) Hello Tom
You're off
What are your plans
Back,  suppose, slowly as  can
He goes to shake her hand and as he releases the tote bag the seam splits and records spill to the ground, scattering
He bends down, starts gathering them up
Marge helps
(cont'd) Oh, damn, sorry, this bag's - Dickie's delighted when he sees the Jazz titles
You like jazz
(gathering up the records) love jazz
(holding up a Chet Baker) This is the best
Marge says she likes jazz, but she things Glenn Miller is jazz
never said that
Bird
That's jazz
Bird
Ask me the name of my sailboat - don't know
What's the name of your sailboat
Bird
Which is ridiculous
Boats are female, everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man
He's not a man, he's a god
(excited) Okay, we're going to Naples
There's a club, it's not a club, it's a cellar
It's vile
Yes, it's vile
Don't worry, you don't have to come
(to Ripley) It's great
You're going to love it
,
cavern blue with smoke
surprisingly good  blast out their version of ' Dickie and Ripley arrive and make their way to a table where Fausto is sitting with friends
It's too noisy for conversation, but Dickie shouts introductions and they shake Ripley's hand
Dickie is instantly absorbed in the music, Ripley absorbed in Dickie
An attractive Italian Girl, , comes over, kisses Dickie, pulls off his hat, puts it on, there's no room for her to sit, so she sits on Dickie's lap, smoking his cigarette
Dickie raises his eyebrow at Tom, but it's clearly no hardship
Then the band strikes up the intro to Tu vuo' fa' 'Americano - a hit which reflects the current craze for all things American - and Fausto pulls a protesting Dickie up onto the stage
(improvising in Italian) Ladies and Gentlemen
Dickie Greenleaf, all the way from America
etc
Fausto starts to sing
Dickie joins in the chorus
Everybody claps
Dickie talks off-mic to Fausto
(cont'd) And a big round of applause for a new friend from New York - Tom Ripley
Ripley's mortified, but Dickie jumps off the stage and pulls him up
The song continues and now, at the chorus, it's Dickie and Ripley who have to sing
Ripley, of course, can sing well, if not confident in this arena
Soon the audience is clapping, standing on tables, dancing, Dahlia prominent
(/) (reading) have bumped into an old friend from Princeton - a fellow named Tom Ripley
He says he's going to haunt me until agree to come back to New York with him
'
Dickie, in his new dressing gown, is sitting at the table, typing
Ripley's head emerges from behind the couch on which he has been enjoying a blissful sleep
(grins) Good afternoon
What time is it
(puts on his glasses and checks his watch) Oh God
Do you always type your letters
(points at the letter) That should be two s
can't write and  can't spell
That's the privilege of a first-class education
You're upstairs at the back
think Ermelinda made the bed up
This is so good of you
Don't say it again
Now you're a Double Agent and we're going to string my Dad alone,  was thinking we might buy a little car with the expense money he's sending you
What do you think, Marge
a little Cinquecento with my Dad's money
Marge has appeared, carrying Camparis
Dickie, you can't even drive a car
No, what we need urgently is an icebox
What do you think, Tom
Agree with me and 'll be your friend for life
absolutely agree with Marge
' ,
Ripley locates his room, puts down his luggage in what is a comfortable and simple room, then heads back downstairs only to be tempted by the open door of Dickie's bedroom
'
Ripley explores the casual elegance of Dickie's bedroom - the Louis Vuitton chest, the closet's open door spilling out shirts, ties
On the dressing table there are toiletries, cufflinks scattered, a silk tie
Ripley picks up the tie and walks towards the open window below which is a terrace where lunch is being laid
Marge and Dickie are chatting
Shreds of conversation float up to Ripley
It'll just be for a little while
He can be
he makes me laugh
Okay, darling
You'd say if you mind
No,  like him
Marge, you like everybody
don't like you
Then 'll go to your place and you can move in with Tom
Above them, Ripley repeats these phrases, carefully, testing the cadences, No,  like him
Marge, you like everybody, until he's as accurate as a taperecorder
'
Ermelinda is clearing away lunch
Ripley is changed and sitting at the table with Marge while Dickie works on the coffee
Ripley watches him, studying everything: the way he uses the expresso machine, the way he wears no socks, his pants, his rings
Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast
It's not love it's the coffee machine
It's the one task Dickie can do on his own - make coffee
Shut up
Oh darling - is that for me
No it's for Tom as he didn't complain
(as Dickie hands him his cup) That ring's so great
The green one
(delighted) Tom,  love you
(to Dickie) See
(to Ripley) bought it for him, for his birthday
It's superb
had to promise, capital , never to take it off - otherwise 'd give it to you
(flicking a crumb at him) Bastard
(to Ripley) Isn't it great, Tom
found it in Naples
bargained for about two weeks
hope it wasn't cheap
Oh, it was
(to Marge) have to find a birthday present for Frances
Perhaps you can help me
Frances
My fiancEe
You're a dark horse, Ripley
Engaged
Your parents met her
Oh God -  can just imagine - if only Dickie would settle down
doesn't every parent deserve a grandchild
Never swear on your ring, Marge
am never going back
The Bird is sailing off the coast of Mongibello
There's a manoeuvre going on with the sail
Captain Dickie supervises his crew of Marge and a painfully awkward anxious-to-please Ripley
Dickie goes over to help him
'm doing this wrong, aren't
You're doing great
We'll make a sailor of you yet
You're doing really well
Dubious but special honor, Tom - crewing Dickie's boat
Alright, bar's open
Yes please
She heads for the cabin
Dickie settles down beside Ripley
Could we sail to Venice
Sure
love Venice
have to go to Venice
See Venice and die, isn't that right
Or is it Rome
You do something and die, don't you
Okay, Venice is on the list
And Rome
Do you ski
(Ripley frowns) Don't tell me - you're a lost cause
That's the next thing to deal with
We're planning to go to Cortina at Christmas
Excellent skiing
Excellent
(as Marge reappears) Marge - Ripley can't ski
We'll have to teach him that, too
Have you ever known such low class
Poor Tom
Good thing we're not getting married
We might have to invite him on our honeymoon
Marge and Ripley are on a shopping expedition
They walk down the hill towards the grocery shop, next to the bar in the little square
Ripley has asked Marge how she and Dickie met
Oh  hated New York - that Park Avenue crowd - so  fled to Paris to work on my book, and  was always going to this cafe with Jean-Jacques, and Dickie used to play his saxophone outside and  would see him and he would see me, and he would play My Funny Valentine
It was only later that  realised he only knows about six songs
They've arrived at the Grocery Store
Alessandra, the woman who owns the store greets them
Silvana, who's her daughter, is also there, and less comfortable
She waits for Marge's order
(cont'd) (to Silvana, in Italian) Buono Sera, Silvana
Por favore: arance e pane, e del prosciutto
fichi
Come sempre
Si
Come sempre
Grazie
Silvana goes inside for the meat and bread
Marge frowns
(cont'd) (back to Ripley) Anyway, then one day, we go in,  see Dickie, he starts playing My Funny Valentine, and then all of a sudden he just walks into the cafe, right in front of Jean-Jacques, and grabs me
Now  had never spoken to him in my life - he said 'm going to Italy, tomorrow, and  want you to come with me
So  did
At the edge of the square there's   , where men throw metal balls along a track, aiming to get closest to a small cue
Dickie is there, playing intensely with Fausto and two other guys, one of whom we've seen before with Silvana
Ripley and Marge loop back towards home, taking in the Bocce en route
Dickie waves
They wave back
Marge calls to him
(cont'd) If you're not at my place by 7
00, Tom and  are running off together
Okay
'
Dickie and Ripley are leaving
They're fooling around
Dickie jumps on Ripley's shoulders
Marge watches from the top of the garden
Dickie and Ripley, still horsing about, pass Silvana's grocery store
Dickie dismounts, goes over to Silvana, who's tense, a little troubled
They huddle, Ripley isolated
Did you get my message
want to talk to you
want to talk to you too
Smile for me
And Dickie's already gone, back to Ripley feinting to box him then dancing, satyr-like, down the hill
Dickie and Ripley on the Vespa
There's a steep incline where the road winds down towards Naples and, as the Vespa gains speed, Ripley is happy to cling to Dickie
You're breaking my ribs
What
You're breaking my ribs
,
Ripley's really singing, carrying the burden of My Funny Valentine in a flawless imitation of Chet Baker
Dickie is playing some sax
After a verse, there's spontaneous applause
Dickie, impressed beams at Ripley
'
, incongruous in pride of place in the living room, casts its glow on a delighted Dickie as he pulls out a couple of beers, handing one to Ripley who is paging through his copy of the Collected Works of Shakespeare
could fuck this icebox  love it so much
(considering Ripley) What were you actually doing in New York
played piano in a few places
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs
few places - that's a few jobs
Anyway, don't want to think about New York
The mysterious Mr Ripley
Marge and spend hours speculating
(drinking) Cold beer
Thank you Dad
Copy out from here
He hands the book to Dickie, pointing out the lines
(staring to write on the back of a postcard) love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes
Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night
Is that true
No
've got more than one shirt
She can do that stuff for you
Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient
(he's finished writing) Now your signature
(watching him write) Not "Dickie"
Your signature
Dickie writes his signature at the bottom of the postcard
Ripley studies the writing, takes off his glasses to clean them
Dickie looks at him
Without the glasses you're not even ugly
(takes them, tries them on) don't need them because  never read
How do  look
Like Clark Kent
(takes them back, puts them on beaming at Dickie) Now Superman
Dickie cuffs him
Ripley looks down at the postcard
know
write like a child
Pretty vile
See this: The and the do you see
- fine, vulnerable - that's pain, that's secret pain
It must be a deep secret, cause  don't know about it
Your handwriting - nothing more naked
See - nothing's quite touching the line - that's vanity
(flattered) Well we certainly know that's true
'
Dickie's in the bath
Ripley, dressed, sits on the stool next to the bath
They're in the middle of playing chess, the board propped on the bath tray
Ripley puts his hand in the water, checking the temperature
He turns on the faucet for a burst of hot
Ripley is absurdly happy
He pours some wine
Do you have any brothers
No, no brothers, no sisters
me neither
Nor does Marge
All only children - what does that mean
He looks at Ripley who looks at him, a little too long
Means we never shared a bath
'm cold
Can  get in
No
didn't mean with you in it
(standing) Okay, you get in
'm like a prune anyway
He gets out, walks past Ripley, who doesn't turn around
But Dickie's reflected in the mirror
Ripley looks, then Dickie turns, holds his look momentarily before flicking him with his towel
/
,
An  is studying Dickie's passport photograph
It's not a recent picture
The official looks suspicious
Dickie is used to it
It is me
It's an old picture
(sighs at Ripley) Every time - 'is it you
Doesn't look like you'
He's signing for his allowance
He has a smart document case with his initials prominently embossed
Ripley watches him sign and collect a large wad of notes
Letters - Greenleaf, and for Ripley
Ripley collects and studies his mail
As they walk outside he holds up one letter to Dickie
Fran
(anticipating her letter) miss you, where are you coming home
Stop telling me what a great time you're having, how you love Dickie
and Marge and
(the next letter) And this one,  think, is your dad
Ripley sits reading the  from Herbert Greenleaf
He frowns, stops reading, looks out of the window
What does he say
He's getting impatient
He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving
You've got to get a new jacket
Really
You must be sick of the same clothes
'm sick of seeing you in them
can't
can't keep spending your father's money
love how responsible you are
My Dad should make you Chief Accountant or something
Let me buy you a jacket
There's a great place when we get to Rome, Batistoni
Ripley loves this idea and mouths the word, "Batistoni"
(cont'd) Andiamo a Roma
We're taking Tom to Roma
' ,  ,
Ripley and Dickie sit outside at a Cafe in the Piazza Navona
Very smart, very sophisticated, very young crowd
There are already several empty coffee cups and a half empty bottle of Frascati
Ripley has his guide book out and is incredibly impatient
Dickie, meanwhile, has stretched out for the duration
Where do we find a carozza for the Forum, or can we hire any of them -
Relax
It's just there's so much to do in a single day
Relax
The most important question is where to eat
hope Freddie made a reservation
Freddie
Freddie Miles
You know - he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip
Ripley hates the idea of having this special day invaded horn makes him look up as   illegally parks his open top sports car opposite the cafe, sees Dickie and bustles over
He's a heavy-set American with a reddish crewcut
Ripley finds him disgusting to look at
Dickie is delighted
(cont'd) Frederico
Ciao bello
(noticing a beautiful woman in an open-topped car) Don't you want to fuck every woman you see
Just once
They kiss cheeks, continental-style
This is Tom Ripley
Freddie Miles
(mugging) Hey, if 'm late, think what her husband's saying
He fills Dickie's glass with wine and drinks it standing up
(cont'd) So let's go
got us a table outside at Fabrizio's
And Dickie's up, leaving Ripley to pick up all the tiny checks to work out the bill and pay it
'll tell you -  am so cabin-crazy with Mongi
Freddie and Dickie link arms Italian-style and cross the street to Freddie's car
know
was there
(looks back to see Ripley struggling to settle the check) Tommy
It's
Two seater
Standing Room Only
Chop, chop, Tommy
Ripley, abandoned, goes over
There's no room in the car
He has to crouch in the rear
(cont'd) You're going to have to sit between us
But don't put your shoes on the seat, know what  mean, put them one on top of the other
Okay
This record store is hidden away down a cobbled alley, and stuffed with the trendiest Romans, all of whom rifle the stacks under a fog of cigarette smoke
There are two , one of which has Freddie and Dickie crammed into it, sharing a set of headphones
Ripley stands outside the booth, holding both of their jackets like a manservant, while inside and behind the glass doors they chat animatedly
He looks longingly at the street, where the light is fading
Dickie catches his hangdog expression and pushes open the accordion doors
Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's
The best thing is - if you want to be a tourist - grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station
(absolutely crestfallen) What club
Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd
Come if you want but thought you wanted to see the Forum
did
And then maybe get the jacket and what have you
(from inside the booth) Dick - you've got to hear this
(oblivious to Ripley's pain) Listen, just take one of mine when we get back
Don't worry about it
did the Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is enough in anyone's life
Ripley hands him the coats, turns away
Ciao
Have fun
Ripley heads for the door, then comes back, raps on the booth
Dickie pushes it open
You said to make sure you didn't miss the train
It leaves at eight
Ripley hikes up Michelangelo's Arcoeli Steps
Then he's looking down from the Campodoglio at the Forum below
Then he's walking by the oversized fragments of the Colossus
This is the real Ripley, the lover of beauty, inspired by art, by antiquity
He's awed
He's cold
He so much wishes he weren't alone
It's past eight, Ripley stands, one foot on the guard step of the Naples train, waiting forlornly for Dickie, then giving up as the train pulls away
He pulls the door to his compartment closed, and sits inside the train alone
'
There's music playing, Bing Crosby's "May "
Very loud
Ripley dances to the mirror,   and ,
He adjusts his hair, catches one of Dickie's expressions
There are clothes abandoned everywhere
He's been having a big dressing-up session
He sings along with Bing
(/) What are you doing
Ripley turns, horrified, to see Dickie standing in the doorway
The music thumps away
Oh - just amusing myself
Sorry, Dickie
(pause) didn't think you were coming back
Dickie turns off the record player
wish you'd get out of my clothes
Ripley starts undressing, his fingers clumsy with mortification and shock
Dickie looks at his feet, shakes his head
(cont'd) Shoes too
(lame, ashamed) You said  could pick out a jacket and just
Sorry
Get undressed in your own room, would you
thought you'd missed the train
Freddie drove me back in his car
(horrified) Is Freddie here
He's downstairs
was just fooling around
Don't say anything
Sorry
Dickie lets him leave and then sits amongst the debris of the dressing-up session, not amused
'
Ripley comes down, apprehensive, to find Marge and Dickie and Freddie having a jolly breakfast on the terrace
Dickie looks perfectly happy
Hi, Tom
Come join us
want this job of yours, Tommy
was just saying - You live in Italy, sleep in Dickie's house, eat Dickie's food, wear his clothes, and his father picks up the tab
If you get bored, let me know, 'll do it
,
The boat is drifting
Freddie and Dickie and Marge are swimming, then Marge climbs back onto the boat, where Ripley is sitting alone, reading
You really should go in, it's marvellous
'm fine
She approaches him, conscious of his isolation
She's in a red bikini, and she towels herself dry as they speak
Are you okay
Sure
They watch Dickie and Freddie fooling around in the water
The thing with Dickie - it's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious, then he forgets you and it's very very cold
So 'm learning
He's not even aware of it
When you've got his attention you feel like you're the only person in the world
That's why everybody loves him
Other times
There's a yell from Dickie as Freddie wrestles with him
(laughing and choking) He's drowning me
It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life - Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley - he's wonderful - did you meet him, he's a musician
- and especially you, of course
and that's only the boys
They watch as Freddie pushes Dickie under the surface
(cont'd) Tell me, why is it when men play they always play at killing each other
'm sorry about Cortina by the way
What about Cortina
Didn't Dick say
- he talked to Freddie
apparently it's not going to work out - (Ripley's devastated, Marge notices, can't look at him) Freddie says there aren't enough rooms
,
and now the boat is sailing again
Ripley is sitting in his spot
Dickie and Freddie are at the tiller
Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back
At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna
don't think so
Come back with me to Rome
There's this great new club
Have some drinks, lotta ladies
Marge, still in her bikini, disappears into the cabin
Dickie makes a face at Freddie
Do you think you can steer this thing
Sure
Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks
What are you doing
Marge-maintenance
Aye, aye
Dickie heads towards the cabin
Freddie takes over the tiller
There's a breeze and the sailboat cuts through the water
From where Ripley sits he can see Capri in the distance, but he can also look down into the cabin, its porthole offering him a restricted view
He looks down and there's a flash of flesh, then nothing
Then as the boat swings with the waves, he glimpses the bikini top flung over a chair, and then Marge's bare foot kicking out rhythmically, the red-painted toes straining
Ripley's mesmerized, aroused, and absolutely betrayed
(cont'd) Tommy - How's the peeping
Come on Tommy, you were looking
Tommy Tommy Tommy
Shamed, Ripley looks away
He stares at the water, parting before the boat, its turmoil reflecting his
'
The Bird returns to the mooring by Dickie's House
Dickie as ever Captain of the Ship, clambering around, shouting instructions, with Ripley, Marge and Freddie as crew
Ripley looks back at shore
Silvana stands watching, staring
Dickie notices her too
'  suddenly breaks the surface of the water
It's a statue of the Virgin Mary, life size, adorned with flowers and a lace veil
As she is revealed, wooden, staring, four men emerge, lifting the statue on a palette, wading towards the shore, the Madonna aloft on their shoulders
The whole town of Mongibello is in attendance for this Annual Festival of the Madonna del Mare, either standing in their fishing boats, or on shore and flanking the Parish Priest and altar boys and incense
,  and  watch from Dickie's terrace
There are hymns and, as the statue is carried to the shore, the men's heads barely above the waves, the congregation applauds at the illusion that the Madonna is walking on water
Suddenly   appears on the surface of the water, about fifty yards from the statue
There's a scream from among the crowd as someone notices the body
It's
One of the  carrying the statue turns first towards the direction of the scream and then towards the floating corpse
It's Silvana's fiancee, and in a second he has let go of the palette,    , and - in absolute grief - wades, swims, splashes towards the body
in the crowd, which breaks up, with other people splashing, fully clothed, into the water
From the terrace, Ripley turns and looks at Dickie, catching his eye
'
Marge and Ripley and Dickie watch from the terrace as below them an  takes away the body
It seems as if the whole town looks on - fiancee, parents, brothers, sisters, police, priest, etc
As the corpse is loaded into the vehicle occurs between Silvana's fiancee and her brother
They are pulled apart
Then the ambulance pulls away
What's the fight about
That's her fiancE, isn't it
Are they blaming him
(sharp) don't know
Why are you asking me
(agitated) How can it take an hour to find an ambulance
(conciliatory) Well, she was already dead, darling, wasn't she, so  suppose - don't know why people say this country's civilised
It isn't
It's fucking primitive
And with that Records, machine, chair go flying across the terrace
Dickie storms inside
Dickie
'll go and see what's the matter
'll go
'
Later, Dickie is slumped in an armchair at the open window overlooking the slipway
He's playing sax
forlorn, keening phrase from  '
Ripley appears, begins tidying the mess in the living room
He picks up empty bottles, an abandoned bikini top
know why you're upset
(Dickie continues playing) know about Silvana, Dickie
About you and Silvana
Dickie stops playing
What about us
He now has an armful of dishes and glasses and bottles
(cont'd) (losing his temper) You don't have to clean up
Really
Ripley disappears into the kitchen
(cont'd) (as Ripley returns) She was pregnant
Did you know that
Do you know what that means in a place like this
'm prepared to take the blame
What are you talking about
You've been so good to me
You're the brother  never had
'm the brother you never had
She came to me for help, she needed money, and  didn't help her
didn't help her
Now she's dead and it's my fault
'm not going to say anything - to Marge, or anybody, the police - It's a secret between us and 'll keep it
And he disappears again, leaving Dickie to resume the sax, somehow in thrall to Ripley
(/) Dear Tom,  think the time has come to discontinue your expense checks
,
Ripley and Dickie are walking out of the American Express Office, Dickie pushing the rest of his money into his case, Ripley - despondent - reading aloud extracts from a letter from Herbert Greenleaf - The thousand dollars, of course, was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing Dickie home
Naturally, hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way
You can't blame him
You could hardly expect this to go on forever
thought you might write again
Now that we're brothers
can't, how can , in all decency
We've had a good run, haven't we
(increasingly miserable) What about Venice
Can we stick to that plan at least
don't think so, Tom
You can't stay on here without money
It's time we all moved on
Besides 'm sick of Mongi
Especially now with everything -  really want to move to the North
need to check out San Remo next week, find somewhere new to keep the boat
But it would be great, though, if you came with me
Our last trip before you leave
There's a jazz festival - we could say goodbye in style
What do you think
last trip
Dickie and Ripley travel up to San Remo
They sit next to each other
Dickie's asleep
Ripley lays his head on Dickie's shoulder , but as he does that, the ticket inspector announces the San Remo stop, taps on the window and Dickie stirs
Then Ripley plays his familiar game of studying his face in the reflection of the train window, so that he can move his head and see his reflection, then back and see Dickie's
Dickie suddenly catches him staring
Ripley looks away
(terse) Why do you do that thing - with your neck
On trains you always do that thing, it's so spooky
,
Dickie and Ripley walk through the terrace of an hotel which lips out towards the sea
There's a restaurant and palms and a   playing, American
Very cool
They pass the band
Dickie's captivated as they head for their table
They pass some girls at a table
Dickie smiles greedily
This is more like it
Didn't  tell you San Remo was crazy
They're shown to a good table
Dickie watches the band while their glasses are filled with champagne
Ripley looks happy
He's got Dickie all to himself
To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life
To Mongi
You're cheerful tonight
'm suddenly quite happy to be going back
That's good
've got plans
Ripley's plans
Esatto
'm always planning
Did  know you at Princeton, Tom didn't, did
Why are you asking all of a sudden
No reason
Because you're leaving, guess
don't think you were there, were you
Why
mean it as a compliment
You've got such great taste,  don't know
Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste
Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick
Freddie's the perfect example
Then 'll take it as a compliment
knew it
had a bet with Marge
(a beat) Ha
Do you even like jazz - or was that something for my benefit
(conceding, without guile) 've gotten to like it
've gotten to like everything about the way you live
It's one big love affair
If you knew my life back home in New York
Dickie's distracted by the drummer who's playing an extrovert solo, doesn't hear the confession of love
'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums
What
So cool
He mimes a high-hat and snare
Ripley can't quite credit this - it's superficiality
The bay of San Remo
and  have hired a motor boat
That's how  found my place in Mongi
Took a boat out round the bay
The first place  liked,  got it
The motor boat is ploughing the waves
Dickie exhilarated by the speed
Dickie, slow down, come on
Ripley grips the oar, his knuckles white
Dickie cuts the motor, and the boat slows to a crawl, miles from the shore
(ecstatic) love it here
Gonna live here
Dickie takes off his jacket, then drums against the edge of the boat, developing a rhythm with his lighter and fingers, already on the way to becoming Buddy Rich
wanted to tell you my plan
So tell me
thought  might come back
In the New Year
Under my own steam
(suddenly tight) Really
To Italy
Of course
Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here - perhaps we could split the rent on a house - 'll get a job - or, better still,  could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here - Oh God,  don't think so
- you see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me
Marge and  are getting married
(appalled) How
How
Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married
It's absurd
love Marge
You love me and you're not marrying me
(cold) Tom,  don't love you
No, no, it's not a threat, 've explained all of that
'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest
think we've seen enough of each other for a while
Ripley stares at him, his eyes suddenly reptilian
What
You can be a leech - you know this - and it's boring
You can be quite boring
(volcanic) The funny thing - 'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are
'm absolutely honest with you
've told you my feelings
But you, first of all  know there's something - that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious - (incredulous) What evening
Sure -  know, that's too dangerous for you, fair enough, hey
we're brothers, fine, then you do this sordid thing with Marge, fucking her on the boat while we all have to listen, which was excruciating, frankly, plus you follow your cock around like a - and now you're getting married
'm bewildered, forgive me
you're lying to Marge then getting married to her, you're knocking up Silvana, you've got to play sax, you've got to play drums, which is it, Dickie, what do you really play
Dickie, furious, gets up, and lurches towards Ripley
(attacking him, administering tiny slaps as punctuation to his tirade) Who are you - some imposter, some third class mooch - who are you to tell me anything
Actually,  really really really don't want to be on this boat with you,  can't move without you moving, which is exactly how it feels and it gives me the creeps
(he goes to rev up the engine) can't move without - "Dickie, Dickie, Dickie" - like a little girl
You give me the - ,
Shut up
Just shut up
Just shut up
The boat slows as Dickie releases the tiller
Dickie looks up at Ripley wearily and slides onto his back
For God's sake
Ripley, shocked at himself, goes to Dickie, rocking the boat, catches him up, then is horrified to see Dickie's face, apparently unmarked,   , a line of blood and then a peeling like a fruit bursting
Ripley's appalled terrible roar issues from Dickie as he launches himself at Ripley
(cont'd) 'll kill you
Ripley finds himself pushing him away, picking up the oar, kicking off Dickie's hand around his ankle
The boat is rocking and swerving crazily as Dickie falls against the tiller
Ripley almost loses his balance
His glasses come off
They struggle, locked together in a life or death wrestle to get control of the oar
Dickie's blinded by his own blood, loses his grip
Ripley, terrified, hits Dickie again and again, the oar like a carpet-beater banging down flat, blood on the blade, blood on Ripley, until he's on his knees, heaving for breath, letting his arm drop, then realizing, disgusted, that he's let it rest in a pool of blood
He starts to sob, sprawls there, sobbing, next to Dickie, horrified by what he's done
Nobody's in sight
The boat rocks, gently, the sun sparkling indifferently on the waves
Ripley lies by Dickie in the bottom of the boat, in the embrace he's always wanted
The pretty blue-and-white boat rocks peacefully
The sea calms
deserted cove, several miles along the coast
Ripley clambers onto a rock over the shore
He's watching the boat slowly sinking
Shuddering from the exertion, the cold, he finds Dickie's jacket, puts it on and watches as the boat disappears under the surface
Ripley walks back towards the hotel, still wearing Dickie's jacket, cold and wet, his bag over his shoulder
Ripley approaches the front desk
He's shivering
He's not wearing his glasses
Can  have my key, please
(at the key rack) Of course - But you must be very cold
Signor Greenleaf
Yes
- (mind racing) No, it's - 'm
Ripley sits on the bus as it rumbles towards Mongi
He stares out of the window, full of what he's done
No idea what to do
, '
The  comes into town
Ripley gets out, looks calm, very together
'  ,
Ripley walks into the living room, slowly approaches Dickie's saxophone which is on its stand on the table
He can't get close to it, it evokes Dickie too much
'
Ripley has Dickie's Hermes Baby typewriter on the desk and is busy writing letters
He has finished a letter to the Greenleafs, now he's at the end of one to Marge
We can read part of it - / American Express, Rome 9 November 1958
Dear Marge, this is a difficult letter for me to write Ripley produces the Shakespeare and Signature page and '  at the end of the letter
' ,
Ripley stands at the entrance to Marge's garden where she is working at her book on the outside table, surrounded by references and notes, held down by bricks
He looks at her until she looks at him
She's startled, gasps
Hello Marge
Tom, you startled me
You're back
How are you
Sorry
Is your book going well
Yes - 'm on a good streak, thanks
was just looking at you - (looking at her tenderly) - so quiet
Where's Dickie
think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days
(looks at him) Ha
Did he say why
don't know
don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine
What does that mean
Well, one day 'm invited skiing, the next day 'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone
You tell me
Is that what he said - he wanted to be alone
He was thinking of you, Marge - he asked me to deliver this
He hands her a package
She pulls at it, it's perfume
Thanks
he knows  love this, although why it couldn't have waited
Errand number one - deliver Marge's perfume
Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone
(alarmed) How long's he staying for
Search me
guess we're abandoned
,
Marge is walking along the beach and out onto the jetty, forlorn, a bleached figure on this winter morning
'
As Ripley walks down the stairs, Marge is at the icebox in the living room
She's fixing herself a drink, has the icebox open for ice
She's ashen, and might have been weeping, walks back into the kitchen area
There was a letter from Dickie in with my perfume
You realize it's more than a few days
He's thinking of moving to Rome
She bangs out the ice onto the counter, cubes falling everywhere
Ripley drops to the floor and starts to clear them up
She's got the letter, shows it to Ripley
He puts fresh ice into her glass
(cont'd) The thing is, the night before he left, we talked about moving, together, going North - and  suppose  put some pressure on him, about getting married,  just might have scared him off
There's a side to him, when our heads are on the pillow, know no-one else sees it, which is really tender
(unravelling) think  should come with you to Rome and just confront him
Ripley lights a cigarette
Marge loses confidence
(cont'd) He hates being confronted
think you're right
,
'   are carried into the tiny lobby of this small hotel
He exchanges his passport at the desk for his room key, then makes his way, carrying his own luggage to the metal cage elevator
: '     is pulled along on a baggage trolley by a liveried
Dickie's passport slides across the marble desk
key comes back, collected by a hand sporting Dickie's two distinctive rings
As , the Front Desk Manager, inspects the passport, he looks at the owner
Ripley wears a terrific suit, his hair parted in the Greenleaf style, no glasses
His voice, when he speaks, has the same, lazy, confident drawl
Welcome back, Signor Greenleaf
(walking away) Thank you
' ,
The  takes the cases and opens them as Ripley walks around the suite
It's large and splendid
Ripley breathes in its opulence
He immediately picks up the telephone
Yes, 'd like you to telephone the Hotel Goldoni
Yes
want to speak to Signor Thomas Ripley - No ipley, , yes
Grazie
He produces Dickie's pen and signs the blotter quickly - Greenleaf Then he pulls out a postcard from the writing case to reveal Dickie's Stars, hide your fires handwriting specimen
He compares the two signatures, is pleased
The telephone rings
(cont'd) Pronto
Signor Ripley is not there
'd like to leave a message
Yes
Please call Dickie - Dickie Greenleaf - at the Grand
'  ,
tiny, cell of a room, single bed
Ripley on the phone
He's not there
Very well
'll leave a message - Got your call
Dinner tonight sounds fine
Ripley (listens as it's read back) Dinner tonight, yes, is okay
Yes, thank you
,
Ripley has bought some more   - a briefcase and overnight bag
He is at the counter, signing checks
'd like these to have my initials - embossed,  don't know the word in Italian
embossed
Embossed, of course, Signor Greenleaf
There's an excited rap on the window and a shout of
Shocked, Ripley looks over to find   outside, alone and delighted to see him
He grins and mouths hello
(entering the shop) Dickie
Oh my God
Ciao
'
Ripley and Meredith walk across the Piazza towards the cafe
But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you
What
At Christmas
To Cortina with Freddie Miles and - (interrupting, astonished) How did you know that
Everybody knows Freddie Miles
(unsettled) Is Freddie in Rome
Now
don't think so
But 've met him, of course, and we've chatted and  know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are
Freddie said you were a rat and  thought to myself now know why he travels under
've left Marge, Meredith
And Mongi
So the rat's here now, in Rome
Sorry,  wouldn't have made a joke if - Don't be sorry
've never been happier
feel like 've been handed a new life
,
Meredith and Ripley walk down the Spanish Steps and head inside the office
The truth is if you've had money your entire life, even if you despise it, which we do - agreed
- you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it
know
've never admitted that to anyone
,
Ripley's signing Dickie's allowance receipt
Meredith is with him, signing her own counterfoil
He is, of course, endorsed by her presence
She goes to the window ahead of him
She takes her money, turns to him
He hands over his documents
The Clerk compares Ripley's signature with the one on the passport and then looks up at him
Ripley is cool as a cucumber
don't want too many large bills
Nobody will change them
' ,
Where   is finishing the fitting of a cashmere jacket for Ripley
Bolts of cloth everywhere as Meredith adjudicates the possible materials, which the tailor holds up against Ripley
Show me the other one again
(the Tailor obliges) like them both
'll take them both
Ripley goes inside the bedroom to change
While he's inside, Meredith shows the Tailor out
As she returns she notices the open sax case, peers inside
(/) know you're a jazz fiend but do you absolutely hate the Opera
've been trying to give my tickets away, it's tomorrow, but if you were prepared to be dragged
She looks up to catch him bare-chested
She's intoxicated by him, the romance she feels to be in the air
(emerging) You could drag me
,
On stage is Act Two of Eugene Onegin
Lensky sings his aria before the duel with Onegin
Ripley's in a tuxedo, in a box which includes a glamorous Meredith and her
He knows what comes next
Lensky is shot by Onegin
Blood pours from his neck into the snow
Onegin, horrified at the death of his friend, goes over, wraps Lensky in his cloak, the silk lining flashing, kneels holding him
Ripley can barely hide his emotion
Meredith watches her sensitive friend, entranced
,  ,
The Interval
Ripley and Meredith exit their box with Meredith's Aunt and Uncle (who heads for the interval drinks)
Thanks so much for inviting me tonight
Can you bear it
We hear you're a friend of Freddie's - he has hate Opera tattooed on his chest
There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest
(laughs) 'm sure we've met
They reach the console where Uncle Ted has their drinks
(cont'd) was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted
This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy
Thanks, yes,  think we did
One minute you people are children and the next you're getting tattooed
,
Ripley heads past the Beautiful People on his hunt for the Men's Room, and walks straight into a young and cultured Englishman
They greet each other and suddenly  is beside them
(as if she's seen a ghost) Oh my God
Tom
Marge, how are you
What are you doing in Rome
Is he here
Are you with Dickie
No
(to Smith-Kingsley) Hello, 'm Tom Ripley
Peter Smith-Kingsley
've heard about you, of course - from Marge, and Dickie
(works out what's strange) No glasses
He fishes out the glasses
(to Peter) Ditto
Where are you hiding him
He's impossible, isn't he
Is he really not here
Marge, you know Dickie has hate Opera tattooed on his chest
You were going to Venice
Yes, what happened
heard you were desperate to come
was looking forward to rowing you around
am
really am
And 've been travelling
just can't seem to get that far north
Well hurry, before we sink
(reaches into his jacket) Should  give you my telephone number in Venice
Thanks
The  ' ringing
Peter hands over his card to Ripley, sees Meredith
Look there's Meredith thingy - who's that, Marge
- they're in textiles
Meredith - (embarrassed at not remembering) God, how awful, 've spent Christmas in her house
don't know her
(to Ripley) He hasn't called, he's hardly written, just these cryptic notes
You don't just dump people
The last
There's a mini-stampede to return
Will we see you later
can't later
And tomorrow
Tomorrow's possible
Do you know Dinelli's
Piazza di Spagna
know the Piazza di Spagna
What time
Ten thirty
We'll be there
Okay
Marge, see you tomorrow
(to Peter) It's really good to meet you
,
Ripley goes straight to Meredith and grabs her
Let's go
thought you were enjoying yourself
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon
You're crazy
It's freezing out there
He's looking past her, where a mirror reflects Marge wading through the audience, Peter's elegant head getting dangerously near as they approach their seats
'mon,  need to talk to you
Just the two of us
(quite taken) Okay then, you're crazy
,
Meredith shivers in the raw night as they cross the Tiber
Ripley as Dickie is confessing his heart belongs to Marge
Don't worry
Really
Don't worry
You're such a pal to understand
It's as if Marge is here now -  look at you and see her face - and  can't, whatever 'm feeling towards you -  just can't
No,  absolutely understand
Of course
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off
Beating you away
' ,
They arrive at the courtyard outside Meredith's Apartment Building
Ripley jumps down, collects her
She makes to go inside, then looks at him
Will you meet me tomorrow
Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly
So it's not just this, it's too
you should always save pain for daylight
Oh Meredith, 'm sorry
Of course 'll meet you
Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's
(fluttering) don't - is that by the Spanish Steps
Exactly
10
30 - (instantly correcting himself) 10
15
He gets back into the carozza
It moves off

Meredith sits waiting in a cafe at the bottom of the Spanish Steps
Ripley, dressed as Ripley, is at the top of the steps, among early tourists, watching as she drinks her coffee at an outside table
Then Marge and Peter appear walking up the Via Condotti, head for another table, don't see Meredith
She acknowledges Peter who hasn't noticed her
Peter
Hello, it's Meredith Logue
Of course it is, Meredith, hello, 'm sorry, half-asleep, how are you
This is Marge Sherwood
Meredith Logue
Hello
Hearing Marge's name Meredith reacts, freezes
Join us, won't you
We're just waiting for a friend
Do you know,  wonder did we see you at the Opera last night
won't actually, although  think this might - are you waiting for Dickie
Well no, as it happens, although
(stunned at the mention of his name) Dickie
Do you know Dickie
You were at the Opera
Well, that explains - yes  was there
was there with Dickie
(to Peter) told you
knew it
(moving over to them) Marge,  don't know you, so  have no right, but Dickie loves you
He's - think you'll find he's coming home to you
(proprietorial) How would you know that
He told me everything
was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so
'm going to go now,  think
Unless he meant us to meet - which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it
No, we're meeting another friend
Tom Ripley
Do you know Tom
Ripley
No
heard about him, of course, but no,  didn't meet him
The  has arrived to take orders
Meredith indicates she's leaving
(cont'd) Not for me
No, grazie
Marge is on the edge
Peter lays a hand to comfort her
(cont'd) hope  didn't complicate matters, but nothing, nothing untoward happened, nothing to prevent you from welcoming him back, from marrying him
Goodbye
Goodbye Peter, please don't get up
Peter gets up
Ripley, from his vantage point at the top of the steps, watches Meredith leave and walk off into the crowd
He begins the slow walk down towards the square
As he becomes visible to the cafe, he starts to hurry
He's apologising to Marge and Peter as they see him, in his element, lying and believing in his lie
Sorry, sorry
Had to renew my papers
Italian bureaucracy - never one stamp when they can make you line up for three
Have you been waiting long
Not at all
Morning Tom
Hi
(to Marge) Sorry
You okay
You look as if you've seen a ghost
Dickie was at the Opera last night
don't believe it
Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to - He was there with someone
So  suppose she must have dragged him - that's not fair
'm going back to Mongi
think Dickie's coming home
(to Peter) 'm going to go home
Really
That's swell
No,  was just - you're way ahead of me
Great
We think he's had a change of heart
(to Marge) So we should be celebrating
hope so
(to Marge) That was moving, wasn't it
When Meredith said - (to Ripley) Meredith's the American girl  saw last night,  know her, at the Opera, she's been seeing something of Dickie - My God
But the point is Dickie - well we know this - Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses
It's fantastic
(to Peter) feel guilty
Marge doesn't understand this, but anytime Dickie does something feel guilty
,
Ripley is being shown an    in the Palazzo Gioia by a dry-witted older woman,
Ripley explores, relishing the decor
Accendo il riscaldamento
('ll turn the heating on
) (mimes playing sax) Mi piace suonare
( like to play music
) (shrugs) Io sono sorda
Quelli di sotto, una coppia, sono sordi
Allora, ti piace
('m deaf
The couple below are deaf
So, do you like it
) '
Ripley is in the apartment, fire burning, wearing pyjamas
There's a small Christmas tree
He kneels on the floor with some festive, gift-wrapped packages
He opens a package
It's a marble head of Hadrian
gasp from Ripley
He picks up a glass, pours himself a drink
'
Ripley plunges into Bach's Italian Concerto on his new and precious toy, a
His doorbell rings
He stops playing
He doesn't get visitors
He rises, a little nervous
Hello
(/) Dickie
Who is it
(/) It's Freddie
Let me in
He's faint
(/) Dickie, come on, it's me
Ripley can't think what to hide, where to hide
He opens the door
Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley
(confused, not pleasantly) Oh hello, where's Dickie
How are you
Yes, 'm good, thank you
Dickies at dinner
He's at Otello's
Do you know it
don't think he's at dinner at 6
30pm
If you said he was still at lunch 'd believe you
Incredible
The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth
guess
The landlady - as far as  could tell, the landlady said he was here right now
He's gone to dinner
Search the place can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you
Because he's been hiding from me - what happened at Christmas
What about Christmas
He was supposed to come skiing
didn't get a cable or a call or a note or, frankly, a fart
Ripley has his hands behind his back
' '
Ripley wanders into the kitchen, turns on the tap to sluice his fingers
(/) Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he
think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly
Which is horseshit
Have you heard him play that thing
(gesturing at the sax on its stand) He can't
(/) (casually) How did you find him
It's such an out of the way apartment
Can  fix you a drink
No thanks
(explaining his detective work) Some kid at the American Express Office
(he starts to explore) Are you living here
Now he starts to hammer a nasty boogie-woogie on the piano
(returning, flinching) No
No, 'm staying here for a few days, in Rome
That's a new piano, so you prob - (/) Did this place come furnished
It doesn't look like Dickie
Horrible isn't it
- so bourgeois
Now he's poking at the Hadrian bust
You should watch that
In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you
Hardly
Have you done something to your hair
Ripley starts to smile, his eyes darting around the room
Freddie, do you have something to say
What
think 'm saying it
Something's going on
He's either converted to Christianity - or to something else
suggest you ask Dickie that yourself
Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso
Is it on "delle Croce, just off the Corso" You're a quick study, aren't you
Last time you didn't know your ass from your elbow, now you're giving me directions
That's not fair, you probably do know your ass from your elbow
'll see you
'
Ripley shuts the door, smooths the silk runner on the table where Freddie's hand had rucked it
He goes back to the door, opens it and looks over the rail
, '
Ripley can't make out the text but there's some discussion about Signor Greenleaf and Signor Ripley Ripley hurries inside as Freddie's heavy shoes start to clump up the stairs again
' ,
Freddie knocks on the door which pushes open
As he marches in, he launches into his interrogation
Ripley
There's someth - - , Freddie falls like an ox, first to his knees, groaning, then to the floor as Ripley brings the head down again, beating him downwards
As Freddie slumps away, Ripley loses his balance and the head sends Freddie a glancing blow before slipping from Ripley's grasp and smashing on to the floor
It's deserted
Ripley hauls Freddie out of the shadows towards the car
couple walk across the square
Ripley talks to Freddie, berating him for his drunken stupor
He pushes him over the door and into the passenger seat
(mimicking Freddie's voice) Hey, if 'm drunk, think what her husband's saying
The Fiat noses along
Black fragments of tombs punctuate either side of the poorly lit road
Inside the car, Ripley looks to left and right for a place to dump the body
He slows near a clump of trees
' ,
Someone is  urgently at the door
Ripley opens it, finds himself face to face with Signora Buffi and One of them offers his hand
Dickie Greenleaf
Yes
Inspector Roverini
Can we come in
'
Ripley sits with his head in his hands at the table
Roverini and his sergeant, , watch patiently
It's a terrible shock, eh
What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday
can't be absolutely sure - 8
9
We'd both taken on far too many drinks - but it was dark, it was certainly dark when walked him down to his car
So Signor Miles drove away and you did what
went to bed
Freddie's a big man, but 'm in trouble after a couple of drinks
've suffered all day
Who found him
Roverini has walked over to the bust of Hadrian
Senta
We have to ask you to stay in Rome
Yes, if it's going to help, certainly
So, the Doctor, he has to make the - (looks at Baggio) - come se dice
Postmortem
Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening
Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car
No
,  ,
Ripley comes through a dark tunnel in the Ghetto on his scooter
He drives past a furniture store, spilling out onto the street
He glances sideways, sees his reflection fractured into several images and, for an instant, it seems   ' Ripley screams and swerves, crashing into the pavement, the scooter falling onto him and pulling him along the cobbled passage
The man he thought to be Dickie, an Italian, runs up concerned
,
Ripley emerges from the American Express Office
Across the street at the cafe, as once before, sits Marge
Ripley slips Dickie's bag into his knapsack as he approaches his scooter
Marge spots him and strides across the piazza
She is in no mood for pleasantries
Did he kill Freddie
Marge, when did you get here
Tell me the truth
Did he kill Freddie
'd swear he didn't
Of course he didn't
tried again, waiting here, watching for him
Instead it's you
Whenever  look for Dickie  find you
(focusing on Ripley's cuts and bruises) What happened to your face
Dickie did it
(suddenly tense) Dickie
My face
There was an argument
said some things  shouldn't have
About you
About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us
And the next thing know he's launched himself at me
(he pulls the scooter off the stand) Are you getting on
What
Get on
'll take you to him
Ripley and Marge come round the corner on the scooter
The entrance to the Palazzo is blocked by a couple of police cars
Inspector Roverini emerges from one of them
Ripley, startled, drives straight past the entrance
,
Ripley pulls up several hundred yards later, in a different piazza full of book stalls
Marge is confused
Where does Dickie live
We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were
The Palazzo Gioia
They don't even know 'm in Rome and 'm not going to incriminate Dickie - Perhaps  shouldn't go either
(thinking hard, distracted) No, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the Police about my face - they find out he hit me - he's got a temper - he could've hit Freddie
(sincerely) Good luck, Marge
'll catch up with you later
And he drives off
At the first opportunity and roars towards the Palazzo
Ripley drives towards the entrance
As Ripley gets off and pushes his scooter through the doorway  , '  come running out and swarm around him with questions about Freddie
One of them gets off a photograph
It's chaos, a Police Officer shouts him away as Ripley puts up a protective hand and runs inside
,
As Ripley hurries inside he encounters officers conducting more thorough forensic investigations in the stairwell
On a landing is Roverini
Ripley hurries towards him
Can we go up
Do you mind
Of course
What happened to your face
My scooter
fell off
Getting chased by photographers
He hurries up the stairs, Roverini in tow
(cont'd) (agitated) The telephone, the press, 've been, 'm feeling hounded - do you think you could not give out my address
Never
We've had many requests and, of course, we say no - even to your fiancEe
really don't want to see anybody
Even your fiancEe
Even her
What about Thomas Ripley
What about Ripley
Ripley's way ahead and has reached the door of his apartment
He waits nervously for Roverini
He unlocks the door and can barely wait for Roverini to catch up
'
Roverini follows Ripley inside, Baggio hurries in behind him
You and Signor Ripley went to San Remo, is that right
Ripley is appalled
He smiles
Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo
That was months ago
November,  thought
Was it
Did you speak to Tom
November 7th is my information
don't remember the exact date
And when did you last see Signor Ripley
few days ago
Does he stay with you here
No
No
Here is a pattern
Two days ago Freddie Miles is dead - he leaves your apartment and is murdered
Yesterday a little boat is found in San Remo full of rocks, and the owner tells the Police it was stolen on November 7th
We look at hotel records and we see oh
Dickie Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then our boatman remembers two Americans taking a boat
It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence
There must be fifty hotels in San Remo, there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day
31 people
31 people
Baggio appears
Speaks to Roverini
Ripley is getting cranky
That is Miss Sherwood now
Marge Sherwood
(appalled, defeated) Let her in, what's the difference
Let her in
(Baggio is on his way to the door
) No, actually, no, 'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later
Roverini nods, mutters to Baggio, who heads out
(cont'd) Thank you
(watching him) May  ask
why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancEe
think  just said
Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me
Nor did he ask me every day if  would marry him
And when
Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley
'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends
Now  think  have upset you
My English perhaps is coarse
It is a little coarse, yes
Sorry
No-one has seen Signor Ripley since San - have
You have, yes
No,  have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her
and if  could remember which hotel he was staying at - the Goldoni
- Tom was staying at the Goldoni
Good
The Goldoni
Yes - you're right coincidence
(he gets up to leave) look forward to our next meeting when will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone
Alto
Absolutely
(suddenly turning) have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car
She wants to identify you in a - confronto line-up
(ominously) Tomorrow then
(thrown, scrabbling) Tomorrow
Ripley lets them out, heaves a heavy sigh, then peeps through the door, looks down to see Roverini speaking to Marge on the stairs
(/) Buongiorno, Miss Sherwood
He's in but really don't think he wants to see anyone
Ripley leans against the door, the noose tightening, then suddenly a voice shocks him upright
Dick
Dickie
know you can hear me
What am  doing, chasing you around
was going to say  would count to three and if you didn't open the door, but won't count any more
On you
won't count on you any more
Whatever it is, whatever you've done or haven't done, you've broken my heart
That's one thing know you're guilty of, and  don't know why,  don't know why,  just don't know why
Ripley listens, there's a silence, then Marge's footsteps as they ring out on the stone stairs
The tapping sound resolves into the tap-tap of a manual typewriter
' ,
Ripley's at the typewriter, he begins to type
(/) My dear Tom, 'm getting out of this
Freddie's death, Silvana
've thought about going to the police, but  can't do it,  can't face it
can't face anything anymore
' ,
Ripley is working quickly, selecting clothes, dividing them into   - one for Dickie's trunk, one for his own battered suitcase
He puts the license plates from Freddie's car in Dickie's luggage
He has placed one shirt on the Ripley pile then checks again, and - on seeing Dickie's initials, places it with the bigger pile, then picks it up again and holds it briefly against his cheek
He takes Dickie's rings, opens up a   of buttons and needles and cufflinks and sadly tosses them in
Dickie's leather writing case goes on the big pile, too, as do cuff links, ties, the Mont Blanc, Dickie's passport, which he opens to scratch at the photograph , obliterating the face
(/) wish  could give you the life took for granted
You've always understood what's at the heart of me, Tom
Marge never could
suppose that's why 'm writing this to you, the brother never had
The only true friend  ever had
In all kinds of ways you're much more like the son my father always wanted
realise you can change the people, change the scenery, but you can't change your own rotten self
Now  can't think what to do, or where to go
'm haunted by everything 've done, and can't undo
'm sorry,  can't go on
've made a mess of being Dickie Greenleaf haven't
He's finished the letter, signs it, puts it in an envelope marked Tom Ripley and places the letter on top of the piano next to Dickie's passport
His head is reflected in the distorting curve of the lid
As he puts on his glasses there's a moment when there are two heads slowly separating, as Ripley leaves behind his brief life as Dickie Greenleaf
,
Ripley carries Dickie's luggage down into of the Gioia, a wretched place full of shadows and gloom and the overflow from thirty apartments
red plush couch sits on top of a mound of furniture
He finds some dustsheets and shoves the cases under them
Then Dickie's saxophone
Outside the small window, Ripley sees uniformed feet and the revolving blue light of a Police Car
He shrinks back, turns off the light and disappears into the dark, illuminated fitfully by the strobe of cold blue
,
Ripley, familiar battered luggage in tow, appears at the entrance of the building next to his own, glances at the police car parked opposite the big doors, then hurries off into the darkness
Ripley's briefly silhouetted as he scuttles down an alley, hurrying towards a gate, and disappears behind it
,
Ripley sits next to his battered luggage at the prow of a as it surges towards Venice at dawn
Peter Smith- Kingsley waits on the quay
Ripley waves
Peter waves back
(indicating the taxi stop) 'll see you over there
,
Ripley and Peter walk through the square, the pigeons scattering
Ripley breathes in the atmosphere, the beautiful grey
Peter, 'm really sorry to put you through this
just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten
Don't be daft
It's fine
'm delighted you finally made it to Venice
'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece
What rumour
That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport
know, ridiculous
,
Later
Ripley sits in the middle of a bustling Police Station, where thefts, tourists, thieves and complaints are being processed
The Station is in an old brewery or armory
It's a horrible, monochrome, oppressive place
Peter is in conversation at a desk, turns and walks over to where Ripley waits
Welcome to Venice
This place reeks, doesn't it
Can you smell it
Ugh
Sorry
Not the best way to spend your first day
It's okay
Anyway 've got to the bottom of the delay
Finally
We're waiting for someone from Rome
(completely thrown) What do you mean
They're sending someone from Rome
That's good, isn't it
(as if suffocating) No, but  thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate
was sure that was the - You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here
American tourist murdered - It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned the stench  can hardly breathe
door opens
, fresh from Rome, and a sullen wedge of a man, comes in, scowling at the couple
Ripley dare not look up in case it's Roverini introduces him
Colonelo Verrecchia della Polizia di Roma
(to Peter, in Italian) Qui e Ripley
Who is Ripley
(in Italian) Lui
Him
Verrecchia strides past them and into a smaller, interview room at the back of the station
His manner is ominous
,  ,
This room is not at all friendly
There is evidence of a locked area for cells at one wall
small, sour window gives onto a canal
The main station is glimpsed through some internal windows
Peter and Ripley come through
Verrecchia sits down
Verrecchia talks in staccato Italian, during which Peter translates
Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in seguito alla negativa valutazione delle disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con il mio predecessore Roverini che come e noto non e riuscito a impedire il verificarsi della scomparsa del signor Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona al momento passibile di incriminazione del reato di omicidio del signor Miles
(translating) He's taken over the case because
they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie
disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder
Quando e stata l'ultima volta che il signor Ripley ha visto il signor Greenleaf
(When was the last time Ripley saw Greenleaf
) Ripley forgets he's not supposed to have much Italian and answers
In Rome, about three weeks ago
(shrugs) knew that one
(giving Ripley a look) Roma, circa tre settimane fa
Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora
(translating) Where have you been since then
've been backpacking
don't know how to translate that
(he tries) difficile
il signor Ripley dormiva all'aperto, con un
All'aperto
Col freddo che ha fatto
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali
Are you a homosexual
(then as himself) Interesting non-sequitur
No
(translates for him) No
(as Peter, drily) By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals
Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient
Tell him  have a fiancEe, Dickie has a fiancEe and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them
(translating) Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha molte fidanzate
(laughs) Mamma mia, quante fidanzate
They all laugh
What did he say
He says so many fiancEes (suddenly very tough) Lei ha ucciso prima Freddie Miles e dopo Dickie Greenleaf
Vero
As Peter translates Verrecchia watches intently
He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf
(outraged) No  did not
did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf
Is he accusing me
(Peter clearly doesn't ask) Ask him if he's accusing me
He's already angry,  don't think - (interrupting, heated) Just because he doesn't like Americans
Non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private
(This is not the place for your private conversations) (appeasing him) ragione
ragione
(You're right
You're right
) Hmm
'e questa
(There's this
) Verrecchia hands over a letter
It's opened
Ripley's name on the outside
Ripley stares at it
(cont'd) Questa lettera e stata trovata nell'abitazione del signor Richard Greenleaf a Roma
They found this in Dickie's place in Rome
You opened this
Of course
He stands and takes the letter out
Begins to read
He has the look of a man whose privacy has been violated
(to Peter) It's a suicide note
(to Verrecchia) You ask me all these questions and you've already read this suicide note
-'
There's music everywhere - and stands - and posters of performances and
Peter is an opera repetiteur
Ripley is sitting at Peter's piano, playing from the score of Vivaldi's Stabat Mater Peter's made supper
He's setting the table
Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like
To wake up every morning, how can you
Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee
Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful - it all makes sense, doesn't it
inside your head
You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel
But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody
Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there
Because that's what  do
Probably
In my case it's probably a whole building
Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside , but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was
Peter's come over, stands behind him over the piano
That's the music talking
Harder to be bleak if you're playing Knees up Mother Brown He vamps this vaudeville song over Ripley's shoulder
keep wanting to do that - fling open the door - let the light in, clean everything out
If  could get a huge eraser and rub everything out
starting with myself
the thing is, Peter, if
(as Ripley falls silent) No key, huh
,
the soprano part of Vivaldi's
piercingly pure sound in Vivaldi's own church
The orchestra - rehearsing - is conducted by Peter from the organ
Ripley slips in at the back of the church
He stands and listens
Peter sees him, smiles
Ripley smiles back
,
appears on the steps, carrying an overnight bag
Ripley and Peter have come to meet her
(kissing him warmly) Hello Peter, so good to see you
Hello Marge
(coolly) Tom
They walk towards the Vaporetto
(cont'd) So you found Peter
think we sort of found each other
Marge smiles enigmatically
Ripley registers
(cont'd) Where's Dickie's father
He's not coming till the morning
Evidently his stomach -  don't think the food here is agreeing with him
was looking forward to seeing him
Dickie hasn't killed himself
'm sure of that
There's a private detective on the case now - a Mr MacCarron - Dickie's father's employing him
That's a terrific idea
He's American
He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared
They step onto the Vaporetto
(cont'd) Is that what you do before you jump in the Tiber
don't think so
' ,
The boat arrives at the entrance to the house
Peter opens the door as Ripley collects Marge's bags
(to Peter) Is this you
No, it's Tom's
Splendid, eh
Golly
Who's paying for this
Peter found it for me
can afford it because it's damp and, and falling down
' ,
Marge, entering the living room, is astonished at its grandeur
She walks around as Ripley heads for the bar
This is spectacular
That's why Tom wanted you to stay
It's better than squeezing into my room, and know how you hate hotels
hotel would've been fine
(to Ripley) We'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf how far his dollar has stretched
Ripley is shaking a martini
Marge laughs, helpless, somehow raging
Peter turns What's funny
No, nothing
'm just thinking about when Tom arrived in Mongi
(to Ripley) And now look at you
Look at me what
To the manner born
,
St Mark's Square is buzzing with life - tourists, balloon sellers - a man playing saxophone
sits out in the colonade on one of the many tables at Florian's Cafe, cradling a glass of hot water
He gets up as Marge and Ripley arrive
Mr Greenleaf
Tom
How are you
You look well
'm well, thank you
Far cry from New York
Yes it is
Marge, good morning
Unusual weather
Very
And you, sir
Any better
Pretty good
Sticking with hot water
Where's Mr MacCarron
San Remo
The police are amateurs
Well, my boy, it's come to a pretty pass, hasn't it
Yes
What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo
He's being thorough, that's all
'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing
'm learning a great deal about him
hope you can fill in some more blanks for me
Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello
'll try my best, sir
Obviously 'll do anything to help Dickie
Marge looks at him in contempt
This theory, the letter he left for you, the Police think that's a clear indication he was planning on doing something
to himself
just don't believe that
You don't want to, dear
'd like to talk to Tom alone - perhaps this afternoon
Would you mind
Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow - Such as
What a waste of lives and opportunities and - saxophonist is blaring away in the piazza
Greenleaf suddenly explodes
(cont'd) - 'd pay that fellow a hundred dollars right now to shut up
'
Herbert Greenleaf sits on a chair, Ripley pours him some tea
(reading, plunging into gloom) No, Marge doesn't know the half of it
think it might hurt her to know
And his passport photo
Did you hear
To scratch out your own face like that - can you imagine - the frame of mind you'd have to be in
(reading) 've thought about going to the police but  can't face it
can't face anything anymore
feel guilty
feel like  pushed him away
spoke and he heard you
(such a disappointed father) Well, if we all pushed him away what about him pushing us away
You've been a great friend to my son
Everything is someone else's fault
We all want to sow wild oars
Somebody's got to - what's the word
(Ripley shakes his head) The moment someone confronts him he lashes out
He lashes out
You know, people always say you can't choose your parents, but you can't choose your children
' ,
Ripley wakes up from an awful, chilling nightmare, his head full of ghosts
He's cramped up in an armchair, his arms in sine foetal protection He surfaces thickly, stumbles to the door
It's Peter and Marge
'm sorry
was asleep
must have fallen asleep
You look ghastly, Tom
Are you okay
Did Dickie's Dad go
He's having an early night
Poor man
(she heads to her room) We were knocking on that door for ever
(she fiddles inside the sleeve of her dress) think 've broken my strap
Not guilty
'll fix some drinks
You walk in Venice
She takes off her shoe, examining her feet for wear and tear, then disappears into the bedroom
Peter walks over to Ripley, a little concerned
Are you okay
'm fine
(a hand on his shoulder) Do you want me to stick around
It's okay
Or  could come back
Ripley looks at him
That's never happened
He digs in his pocket, finds his key, gives it to Peter
Peter smiles
(cont'd) Your key
' ,
Ripley's in the bath
Marge knocks on his door
(/) Tom
Marge, 'm in the bath
Won't be long
(/) Tom,  need to talk to you
It's urgent
Ripley, irritated, opens the door, his towel wrapped around his waist
Marge is white
She's wearing a robe
She's slightly breathless
found Dickie's rings
What
You've got Dickie's rings
can explain
He can't
His eyes dart
Marge holds up the evidence
Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring
Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this
have to tell Mr Greenleaf
have to tell Mr Greenleaf
have to tell Mr Greenleaf
Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical
He promised me
swear 'll never take off this ring until the day - Shut up
Shut up
His towel slips off from his waist
(cont'd) 'm wet, Marge, 've lost my towel, 'd really like to put my clothes on
So go and pour us both a drink, will you
She goes off obediently, a zombie
He shuts the door
Immediately he starts looking for something, anything, to kill Marge with
He's got a shoe but it feels too light
He opens cabinets, drawers - nail scissors, nothing - then picks up his straight razor and considers it in the mirror
'  ,
Marge is leaving, coat on, as Ripley comes out of the bathroom
Marge
Where are you going
(like a creature caught in headlights) was looking for a needle and thread wasn't snooping
was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra
The scent you're wearing
bought it for you, not Dickie
The thing about Dickie
So many things
The day he was late back from Rome -  tried to tell you this - he was with another girl
'm not talking about Meredith, another girl we met in a bar
He couldn't be faithful for five minutes
So when he makes a promise it doesn't mean what it means when you make a promise
Or  do
He has so many realities, Dickie, and he believes them all
He lies
He lies, that's his
half the time he doesn't even realize
is appearing on the pocket of his robe
As he speaks the stain spreads
He looks at it absently
(cont'd) Today, for the first time, 've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie
He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him - well, you know that
Marge
loved you - you might as well know -  loved you, and because he knew loved you, he let you think  loved him
Didn't you see, couldn't you see
don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day
Tom loves me
(as if she'd heard nothing) Why do you have Dickie's rings
His hand goes to his pocket
'
told you
He gave them to me
Why
When
feel as if you haven't heard anything 've been saying to you
don't believe you
It's all true
don't believe a single word you've said
Marge is shivering
Ripley, ominous, advances, she retreats
You're shivering, Marge
Can  hold you
Would you let me hold you
Marge panics, backed up against the door
She screams and turns straight into the arms of a startled  who's come back to visit Ripley, and is unlocking the door
(sobbing uncontrollably) Oh Peter
Get me out of here
Ripley storms off
His hand comes out of his pocket from the razor
Peter notices, appalled
Tom, are you okay
You try
You try talking to her
(calls after him) Tom
Tom
Tell me, what's going on
(not turning around) give up
,
Peter has just put a band-aid over Ripley's cut hand
You can't be angry with her
She's upset and needs someone to blame
So she blames you
'll go home and talk to her
As for you - either get a safety razor or grow a beard
,   ,
Ripley hurries through the gleaming marble entrance
' ,
Ripley knocks on the door
It's opened by a face he doesn't recognize
middle-aged heavy set man
It's MacCARRON, the private investigator
Is Mr Greenleaf here
Mr Ripley
'm Alvin MacCarron
(/) don't know,  don't know,  just know it
(/) Marge, there's female intuition, and then there are facts - Greenleaf sits with a scrubbed Marge, her hair pulled back, as if newly-widowed Tom
Hello, sir
(smiles thinly at Marge) Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you 'd come by and pick you up
Marge has been telling us about the rings
You know  feel ridiculous  didn't mention them yesterday -  clean forgot - ridiculous
Perhaps you didn't mention them because there's only one conclusion to be drawn
Ripley worries about what that conclusion is as Mr Greenleaf heads into his bedroom
(cont'd) 'm going to take Marge for a little walk, Tom
Mr MacCarron wants to talk with you
(feeling caged in) We could go down to the bar - no need for you to - No, he should talk to you alone
He helps Marge to her feet and leads her out He waits for the door to shut
Aimlessly he walks out onto the terrace, with its staggering, beautiful and indifferent view
,
Ripley stands, steels himself for MacCarron's charges
could probably see my bedroom from here
can see my house
When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it
(coming out) don't care for
don't care to hear it
don't care to speak it
Okay
Why do you think Dickie's father sent him to Europe in the first place
Did you know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half- killed a boy
Ripley turns, shocked
(cont'd) At a party
Over some girl
He kicked the kid several times in the head
Put him in the hospital
The boy had a wire fixed in his jaw
The Rome Police didn't think to ask Mr Greenleaf
MacCarron gets up
(cont'd) Nor did they think to check whether a Thomas Ripley had ever been a student at Princeton University
turned up a Tom Ripley who'd been a piano tuner in the music department
Ripley's head drops
(cont'd) See - in America we're taught to check a fact before it becomes a fact
We're taught to nose around when a girl drowns herself, find out if that girl was pregnant, find out if Dickie had an embarrassment there
Ripley doesn't know where this barrage is going
(cont'd) Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty
He really does
Marge, she's got a hundred theories, but there are a few things she doesn't know
We hope she never knows
hope she never knows
Three different people saw Dickie get into Freddie Miles' car
man who won't identify himself because he was jumping someone else's wife at the time saw Dickie removing license plates from a red sports car
The Police know about this man because he happens to be a Policeman
He walks out of the room, returns carrying from Freddie's car
(cont'd) found these in the basement of Dickie's apartment
They belonged to Freddie's car
Mr Greenleaf has asked me to lose them in the canal this evening
Ripley can't believe what he's hearing
It's like a dream
(cont'd) Mr Greenleaf also feels there was a silent promise in Dickie's letter to you which he intends to honor
He intends to transfer a good part of Dickie's income from his trust into your name
He doesn't intend to give the Italian police any information about Dickie's past
He's rather hoping you'll feel the same
There is a silence in which this strange compact is agreed
Ripley stands with Marge, Mr Greenleaf and MacCarron at the water's edge -   growling
They shake hands, and then MacCarron and Mr Greenleaf get into the launch
Herbert Greenleaf carries the saxophone case
(to Marge) feel  never should have said those things to you the other evening
was pretty flustered, the rings and - and you looked so,  don't know
Marge shakes her head to silence him
(cont'd) But  hope that note goes to New York in your purse, for a rainy day
What are you going to do now, Tom
don't know
Peter has a concert in Athens next month - and he's asked if want to go along, help out
He says goodbye by the way - he's in rehearsal, otherwise - Why do  think there's never been a Ripley rainy day
What
(lunging at him) know it was you -  know it was you, Tom
know it was you
know you killed Dickie
know it was you
Oh Marge
He puts his hand out to control her
She pushes it away
, the frustration too much, so that Ripley has to cover his face
MacCarron comes off the boat to restrain her
Ripley looks at him as if to say: what can you do, she's hysterical
MacCarron nods, pulls her on to the boat
Greenleaf catches Ripley's eye, guiltily
Turns away
They stand silhouetted as the launch revs up and surges off towards open waters, passing the little fleets of gondolas
,
week later and Peter and Ripley are on the deck of the ferry, the , as it sails towards Greece
They're laughing
Ask me what  want to change about this moment
What do you want to change about this moment
Nothing
'
Peter's in a bathrobe organising his currency, his traveller's cheques
Ripley knocks on the door, comes in
Hello
What are you up to
All kinds of things
Making plans
Plans - good, plans for tonight or plans for the future
don't know
Both
My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset
Come with me
You go
don't want to get dressed yet
Come back though
Come back
(smiles at him) You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person
Well, that's entirely your fault
And, if  fall overboard, that'll be your fault too
Ripley stands on deck, staring at the magnificent sunset
Then a voice shakes him from his reverie
Dickie
Dickie
He turns
He's caught
Suddenly he's Dickie
(cont'd) Dickie, my God
Hello Meredith
was looking at you, your clothes, wouldn't have known you
Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward
What
Just kidding
Are you alone
Hardly
couldn't be less alone
Meredith points to the    where are walking around the deck
Of course
Aunt Joan
And co
lot of co
Oh, God, 've thought about you so much
've thought about you
And now he's thinking can't kill them all
When  thought about you  was mostly hating you
Where've you been hiding
haven't been hiding
've been in Police custody
They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer
You're kidding
They're letting me have this vacation
Which is why the get-up
Which is why you haven't heard from me
You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie
It's terrible
know
Look,  can't talk now
Later
Later
He kisses her
Full of future
So - are you travelling under
You know what -  am
Dickie, are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley
bet you are
My aunt thought she saw him
(horrified) Peter Smith-Kingsley
haven't seen him in months
No, 'm alone
(and he understands this is not any kind of lie) '
Peter's working on his score, lying on his front, apparently engrossed
Ripley knocks and enters
Looks long at Peter
How was it
Good
But  think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip
Was that Meredith
(sighs) Was who Meredith
Meredith Logue
You were kissing somebody
Looked like Meredith
Hardly kissing
Kissing off
Didn't look that way - you know - from a distance
lied
To her
She thought she'd seen you
Why lie
Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it
Or Tom and Peter even
Well that would be even better gossip
Really, why
(completely lost) Sorry, 'm completely lost
know
'm lost, too
'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't , that's my, that's my - terrible and alone and dark - and 've lied about who  am, and where  am, and so nobody can ever find me
What do you mean lied about who you are
suppose  always thought - better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody
What are you talking about - you're not a nobody
That's the last thing you are
Peter,
(conciliatory) And don't forget
have the key
You have the key
Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley
Don't get up
Just tell me some nice things
He sits on the bed, leans against Peter
His eyes are brimming with tears
He takes the cord from Peter's robe and begins twisting it in his hands
Good things about Tom Ripley
Could take some time
Tom is talented
Tom is tender
Tom is beautiful
(during this, and tender) You're such a liar
Tom is a mystery
Ripley is pressing against him, moving up his body, kisses his shoulder, the cord wrapped tight in his hands
'
Ripley returns to his cabin
Sits on the bed, desolate
(/) (cont'd) Tom is not a nobody
Tom has secrets he doesn't want to tell me, and  wish he would
Tom has nightmares
That's not a good thing
Tom has someone to love him
That is a good thing
(feeling Ripley's weight on him) Tom is crushing me
Tom is crushing me
(suddenly alarmed) Tom, you're crushing me
The door of his closet flips open with the swell and he catches his reflection
It swings shut
Open then shut
Through the porthole the weather's changing as the light dies
There's a swell as the horizon rises and falls in the round glass
Ripley, alone, in a nightmare of his own making
Lullaby for Cain From the silence from the night comes a distant lullabye Cry, remembering that first cry Your brother standing by and loved both loved beloved sons of mine sing a lullabye mother is close by innocent eyes such innocent eyes Envy stole your brother's life came home murdered peace of mind left you nightmares on the pillow sleep now Soul, surrendering your soul the heart of you not whole for love but love what toll Cast into the dark branded with the mark of shame of Cain From the garden of God's light to a wilderness of light sleep now sleep now
