Haze clings to the lake as we float across it, clearing to bring the opposite shoreline into view
few scattered streetlights
Dilapidated cabins
An abandoned campsite
We continue to drift towards it, hearing the faint sound of seductive music and an occasional giggle
small floats into our foreground, its interior light flickering as   move around inside
- teenage boy and girl,  and , are slow-dancing
Jim's lips softly touch her lissome shoulders
Well
how do you feel
Ask me in about five minutes
She bites his ear, giggles, then kisses him fully
'm talking about graduation
Being totally free to do whatever we want now
Her hands slip inside his Pendleton shirt
He sighs
It feels excellent
Her mouth finds his again
After a long kiss, he gently pulls away from her with a teasing smile
Gotta throw the anchor over
He leaves the cabin
She slips under the bed sheets
- as Jim tosses a small anchor overboard
as the weighty object splashes, sinking into black oblivion, pulling its cable down with it
glances at the lake, at their eerie surroundings
He feels a chill, heading back inside
-  () as the anchor drifts to the lake bottom, dropping a few feet from a    which rests in the lake silt
- as Jim returns with an uneasy expression
He crawls on top of the bed, kissing her again, but not with the same enthusiasm as before
What's wrong
Nothing
He starts to pull off his shirt and join her
She senses his anxiety
'mon, Jimmy
Something's bothering you
Jim pauses, turning off the mood music
It's just that we're right around that old summer camp where all those murders took place
The boat creaks
She's instantly nervous
What murders
Never mind, you don't want to know about it
Tell me
There's nothing to worry about, Suzy
The guy's dead now, somewhere at the bottom of this lake
if you believe the stories
(beat) Let's drop it, okay
He starts to kiss her again
She stops him
What stories
He doesn't want to go into it but Suzy's face insists
There was this boy named Jason Voorhees who drowned in Crystal Lake
Eight year old  is desperately trying to tread water, flailing his arms like a marionette to get attention as he gulps down gallons of mossy lake water
Hhhhelp
me
'm drowning
(
) None of the counselors heard him
Mmmmmmommy
And Jason finally slips under the surface for good
- bunch of years went by and everybody forgot about it
(beat) That's when the murders started
() as our senses are bombarded with   of assorted teenagers just about to die, their screams echoing over each other
We do not see the attacker
As the cacophony reaches a screeching crescendo,   : - as the silence hits us hard again
Jason did it
' That's what some people thought
But they were wrong
() as
comes directly at camera wielding a huge knife and a primal scream
- His mother blamed the counselors for his death and tried to kill them all
(dramatic pause) She got her head chopped off by one of them
We don't need to see this clip
Suzy's reaction is quite sufficient
So the murders stopped
He gives her a long, penetrating look
No
() We're bombarded with   of a hockey masked wreaking havoc on assorted teenagers
brandishing everything from hatchets to knives to chainsaws
Just as Jason is about to stab us,   : - Suzy flinches as if she were getting the knife
Legend has it that Jason came back to avenge his mother's death, vowing to kill every teenager from the area
(beat) And every now and then, the murders start up again
The boat lurches slightly, tugging at the anchor cable
She's scared: he's frightened himself a little, too
Forget about it, Suzy
They're just stories
He brushes her hair back, kissing her cheek gently, finding the nape of her neck again
She closes her eyes, trying to dismiss what he's dredged up
But she can't
Suzy begins to rationalize
We're the last graduating class, right
Jim's kissing her body, putting Jason behind him
Right
mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right
Right
So there's no reason for him to come back because there won't be any of us around
right
Jim stops, looking her squarely in the eyes
Right
Except that Jason isn't real so none of it matters anyway
She starts to relax, returning his kisses
-  () as the anchor drifts along the lake floor, tugging hard on the power cable
Camera  along the cable, coming to a
- as Jim slides on top of Suzy
Thoughts of Jason are starting to slip away along with their clothes
-  () as the chains emit a dull tinkle due to movement from the tugging anchor
Camera continues to  again
and we find to our horror that the waterlogged, fish-eaten body of

) - Teenagers in love, lost in not-so-innocent passion
At the same moment: -  () The anchor tugs one last time and

chases up the anchor cable, sparking across the hoist
- as the electricity feeding the streetlights is abruptly extinguished, plunging the campsite into darkness
- as Suzy's eyes flash open
Did you hear that
Hear what
He pulls her back down
'mon, 'm serious
He knows the mood is broken
All right, 'll check it out
He slips on his jeans, exiting the cabin
She pulls the sheet up around her fearfully
-  () as the cable smolders, void of electricity now
to find the chains again
but they're dangling loosely
- Suzy is tensely kneeling on the bed now
The black void of night is all she sees out the cabin door, which Jim has left open
An uncomfortable amount of time passes
Jimmy
No answer
Her heart starts to pound
Jim
Again, nothing
She wraps herself in the sheet, moving towards the open door
The ship creaks again
' as she grows closer to the doorway, nothing but pitch- black beyond it
Stop screwing around, Jim
mean it
And just as she reaches the door: leaps out, clutching a
Suzy barely has time to scream before
stands there in speechless shock, looking down at her mortal wound
But there's no blood
pulls the knife back out, pushing the blade in and out with his hand
It's a retractable rubber knife pulls off the hockey mask with a huge grin, tossing it aside
Gotcha good, baby cakes
She doesn't know whether to hug him with relief or kick him in the balls
He pulls her back onto the bed, laughing
- sitting dormant on the deck, where Jim tossed it followed by a , The hand grabs it like it's an old friend, pulling it away
- as Jim holds his angry girlfriend down on the bed, trying unsuccessfully to kiss her
All right, all right -- 'm a major ass
And you'll never do it again
And 'll never do it again
Forgive me
No
She's resisting only for effect
Her legs curl around him, finally giving in
- deadly-sharp   rests in its rack outside the cabin
'
- The sheets begin to roll like waves as they work each other
Thoughts of Jason are nonexistent now
- Nothing there for a moment
then a pair of moss-covered closes her eyes with pleasure
- and camera  from the mossy feet, up the bloodless legs and torso to ultimately reveal the hockey-masked face of our anti-hero:
lets out a broad smile, her eyelids fluttering
They stay open long enough to regard the visitor in the doorway
She tries to choke out a warning to Jim, who's just collapsed himself
JJJJJJJJason
He doesn't follow her glance, smiling instead
Uh-huh
You must really think 'm an ass
But she continues to stare in horror as: raises the spear, taking aim
- Hs starts to kiss her but she bolts up with a blood- curdling
second later,    , ,
Jim stares point-blank at his dead girlfriend, not able to assimilate it quickly enough
He spins around to see the monster himself
Ohmygod
Jim springs off the bed, looking around for anything to defend himself with, grabbing the bedside lamp
He '  which has little effect
Jim scrambles to get past him, but Jason ,
- as the  silently drifts onward
The lone silhouette of Jason emerges from within, taking the helm
He's back

: -  - Only the faintest sign of daylight can be seen through a thick blanket of gray fog
In the distance, speckled lights outlining a smaller intermittently appear
- Standing at the boarding ramp is  , clipboard in hand
He's just finished checking off a pair of new-agey
McCulloch is approaching fifty, wearing a tie and unwrinkled clothes, as well as the disposition of a stern puritan
Remember girls, the shuffleboard tournament will start at six p
m
sharp
non-attendance will restrict your time in port, understood
They nod for his benefit, exchanging derogatory whispers as they head up the ramp
Camera  to find a small parking lot adjacent to the docks, where several cars are just now arriving -- parents dropping off their high school seniors, hugging them bon voyage
as   walks toward the ship with pal Sean's a tall, nice looking, somewhat serious guy; Miles is shorter, athletic and more extroverted
You're telling me this boat has a pool with a three meter board
It's a ship and that's right
Plus a disco, gym, game room and a lot more
think 'm gonna blow off New York and just stay on this thing
You'll do no such thing, Mr
Wolfe
Camera  to reveal McCulloch, holding his list, checking off their names
Your itinerary has been carefully planned and make no mistake, it will be executed accordingly
(under his breath) Of course
wouldn't want to risk enjoying this trip
McCulloch gives him a frown
Sean steps up to him tentatively
Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr
McCulloch
Rennie's not coming
He's devastated
But  thought
She changed her mind
(eyeing list) Let's see
Mr
Wolfe is in stateroom one-eleven and you, Mr
Robertson, are in two-twenty-five
booming  from above interrupts them: (
) Sean -- where the hell have you been
We're already into early departure protocol
Standing on the upper deck is a no-nonsense, uniformed Navy man,
The captain of the ship
And Sean's father
Sean's sadness about Rennie's absence is immediately replaced with anxiety
Be right up, Dad
He and Miles head up the gangway, both boys giving McCulloch one last glare
'76  2002 - Behind the wheel is    , thirties, attractive, a progressive attitude
sits next to her -- she's seventeen, pretty, slightly withdrawn
Rennie's dog , a border collie, rides in the back seat
'm glad you decided to come after all
Me too
But 'm not sure Uncle Charles will be
You let me worry about him, okay
(pause) Personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers, Rennie
You made the right decision
What about not-so-great writers
Rennie smiles self-deprecatingly, Miss Van Deusen grinning back
But Rennie's smiles are few and far between, this one disappearing as she glances out the window
'    ( ) as the countless gallons of harbor and lake water spread out before her, eery in the bog
small  grazes across it occupied by two indistinguishable people
Rennie's eyes show a hidden terror
She quickly turns away, shivering briefly
Miss Van Deusen notices
She turns a corner, heading into the parking lot
Everything okay
Just felt a little chill
Rennie rubs her arms, faking coldness
Did you know that 'm giving up teaching
Really
Since the school is closing anyway, 'm going to write that novel 've been threatening on everybody
That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen
what's it about
She parks the car, turning off the ignition
senior class cruise to Manhattan, laced with romance, adventure and murder
(beat) Or a Gothic cook book
haven't decided which
She's coaxed the smile out of Rennie again
Miss Van Deusen pulls a small wrapped box from her glove compartment, handing it to Rennie, who seems utterly surprised
Go on, open it
Rennie pops off the lid, revealing an antique ink-dip pen
Stephen King supposedly used it when he was in high school
don't know what to say
Rennie, you're the best student  ever had
you have a real gift
If anybody can make use of that pen, it's you
Rennie hugs her teacher
Camera  above the car's window, finding a Mercedes 560  pulling in a short distance away
- sexy, money-dressed blonde is behind the wheel She climbs from her leather seats as a trio of walk by, offering enthusiastic hi's and hellos
She's obviously Miss Popular
Tamara crosses to a cute Japanese girl unloading luggage from a beige Honda, Are you ready for drugs, sex and rock 'n roll or what, girl
Eva gives her a warning glance, nodding to her left
Eva's  appears by the passenger door, forcing a smile at Tamara
Hello, Tamara
Hi, Mrs
Watanabe
Just kidding
Yes, 'm sure
Embarrassed, Eva hurries to her Mom, rushing a kiss goodbye
Don't worry about a thing, Mom
'll have a terrific time and  won't do anything stupid, okay
Before Mrs
Watanabe can squeeze a word in, her daughter is gone
She waves a bittersweet goodbye to her graduate
love you
Once they're out of Mrs
Watanabe's earshot -- hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties
Really
'm sure we'll have no problem getting them to party with us
especially with this
Tamara unzips her purse, revealing a baggie filled with fine white powder
Eva looks very nervous
It's my graduation gift from Daddy
It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best
He bought you that
More or less
It's part of my college fund
She grins coquettishly, walking on
Camera  on the calm, foggy harbor
where the faint image of a is aimlessly drifting into port
- Sure enough, it's the same one we saw  on last night
but no one is behind the helm
It seems to be a ghost ship
- as Tamara tries to slip past McCulloch, busy with another pair of seniors
You can stop right there, Miss Mason
He motions the others onward
Busted
Tamara instantly hands Eva her drug-filled purse, paralyzing Eva
MCCULL40CH Only graduating seniors are allowed on this cruise
What are you talking about
You never turned in your final biology project, so 've had your diploma rescinded
You can't do that
It's already been done
(turning to Eva) Congratulations on the 3
9 average, Miss Watanabe
You're in stateroom two- fifty-five
Eva smiles awkwardly, reaching for her luggage, stalling to see what happens with Tamara
Look, Mr
McCulloch,  got in a car accident yesterday and missed our appointment
It's okay, no big deal, just a bruised arm
(squeezes her arm) so  brought my project along today
It's in my suitcase
Really
He looks at her suitcase, not buying a word of this
She's telling the truth, Mr
McCulloch
saw her pack it
He's surprised to hear this
and so is Tamara
All right
But if it mysteriously disappears en route, 'll have you sent back home the minute we dock
Understood
Perfectly
She grabs her purse back from Eva, quickly moving on before he changes his mind
Their voices become whispers
major prick
What are you going to do
Improvise, of course
- as the  haphazardly bumps into barnacle-covered dock pilings, still around fifty yards from the cruise ship
The window is splattered with blood, but still clear enough to make out Tamara and Eva walking up the gangway, along with a half dozen other teenagers mingling on board
' --or rather the remnants of it
It's a piece of frayed woven metal charred by extreme electricity, severed just above water level
Suddenly there's blurry movement behind it; camera   just in time to catch a glimpse of     , - as McCulloch impatiently checks his watch and list again
Miss Van Deusen walks up to him
Hello, Charles
Has everyone checked in
Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up
'm a little concerned
Don't be
They probably decided to explore each other rather than New York
He gives her a disdainful look, starting up the ramp
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late
Charles, there's someone else coming along too
He stops, following her glance
His face tightens
Rennie is walking toward them with a small suitcase, her dog Toby striding next to her
She walks up to him, starts to say something, then decides against it
Rennie heads up the gangway
on McCulloch and Miss Van Deusen
He's livid
You have no right
And neither do you
It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do
She doesn't know what she wants
She's never had a stable life
And she sure doesn't have one now, either
She needs to live
'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and  alone know what's best for her
End of discussion
No,  think it's just the beginning
She walks past him
/ - as she reaches the top of the gangway, her heart pounding
Rennie pauses, working up the courage to look out at the lake again
' The  she saw earlier is still there, even closer now
' contract, her blood pumping faster
Then she hears a (
) Hhhhelp me
Rennie looks straight down at the water beneath her and sees: floundering in the water
It takes us only a moment to recognize him -- '
He's gasping, sucking in huge amounts of liquid, exactly like he did in the prologue
Hhhhelp me
'm drowning
leans back in terror, falling into Miss Van Deusen
What's wrong, Rennie
Rennie frantically points over the ramp edge, unable to speak
Miss Van Deusen quickly looks and sees: ' The water is calm
No Young Jason
as Rennie gets a hold of herself
just got a little dizzy
'm fine
She continues up the ramp
on Miss Van Deusen, watching her go, somewhat troubled by it
to McCulloch below her, also watching
Extremely concerned
continues along the starboard side, not risking another glance overboard
She passes an older, very deranged , mopping the deck
on him, his bloodshot eyes following her like a crazed raven
-    - Sharp and rusty, mounted on the wall amidst jagged scaling knives, shark jaws and other artifacts
to reveal they are surrounding a navigational chart on the cruise ship's bridge
Admiral Robertson and his are preparing for departure, checking the satellite computer as well as the
(checking watch) Let's take in the brow
Yes Sir
(into intercom phone
) Take in the gangway and single up all lines
and  enter the room; Sean gets a glance from his Dad
Miles is very impressed with the bridge
Hello, Dad
Hey, Admiral Robertson
Love your ship
She's a beauty, isn't she
should've retired from the Navy ten years ago
You've really been generous to give us this cruise
know  speak for everybody on board
Everybody
with the possible exception of Sean
He avoids eye contact with his father
Hell, there's just twenty or so of you -- we only need a skeleton crew and it's a pleasure to sail her anyway
(beat) By the way, congratulations on winning the intramural diving championships, Miles
'm sure you made your old man proud
Admiral Robertson gives his own son a glance; maybe Sean should think about doing the same
Have you decided on your departure protocol, Admiral
Actually,  thought 'd leave the honors to my son
Dad,  don't think
(to Chief Engineer, ignoring Sean) Relinquishing command of the Princess Ruby to Captain Sean Robertson
Sean has no say in the matter
Miles can feel his friend's nervousness as well
But before you take the helm, take this
He tosses Sean a wrapped box
Sean opens it
Inside is a navigational computer the size of a calculator, sitting next to a rusty old sextant
Something old and something new used the sextant when  was your age, but now they have these goddamn computers to do all the work for you
(to Sean) Have you decided on a plan of departure, Captain
Sean's nervous
He eyes the Omega, quickly glancing at the , briefly referring to the navigational chart
How about if we start up the forward engines and come around
180 degrees
Aren't you forgetting something
Sean looks flustered
Admiral Robertson storms to a large button, pressing it three times, piercing the air with three long blasts of the ship's horn
It underscores his frustration
We're in foggy weather
Send out the international maritime signal that a vessel is backing down, followed by a security broadcast warning other ships
He shoves the mike out at Sean, but he doesn't grab it, leaving the bridge, humiliated
There's an awkward moment for Miles, unable to find any appropriate words
He exits as well
Admiral Robertson stares out the bridge window, saddened and frustrated
It wasn't supposed to go this way
- as he continues away, his retreat blocked by the The crazy old man pierces a dead serious stare at Sean
This voyage is doomed
Yeah, tell me about it
Sean sidesteps him, moving on
-  ( ) Parents and relatives wave gleefully from the docks as to find eighteen or so teenagers 1ining the upper deck, happily waving back
The ship begins to slice through serene water
The voyage has begun
The water begins to ripple as the ship's speed increases
All seems normal
until '  , He slithers up the side towards the deck as dense fog breezes past him
- as Sean continues along, hands in pockets
He turns a corner and collides with , walking her dog
His eyes instantly brighten, as do hers
Rennie
Hi, Sean
heard you weren't coming
(glances at Toby) We changed our minds
Sean pats her dog
There's an awkward pause
they are obviously in the early stages-of a relationship
Sean reaches into his coat pocket, bringing back a small necklace-sized box
got you a present
But  didn't get you one
Forget it
It's a dumb little thing anyway
Rennie opens it up, exposing a petite silver necklace with a Statue of Liberty pendant on it
She's touched
Sean
it's beautiful
Sean takes it from her, snapping it around her neck
thought maybe we could hike to the top of the Statue when we got there, if you felt like it
It's supposed to be 22 stories tall
'd love to
(
) Your father was looking for you, Mr
Robertson
McCulloch appears behind them
The mood has been broken
guess 'll see you later
Sean leaves
McCulloch steps up to Rennie, pointing out to the foggy sea
Her respiration increases as she psyches herself up to look
There's a storm predicted tonight
Rennie looks at the ocean, forcing herself not to turn away
You're making a big mistake, Rennie
It's not too late to put you back on land
'm staying
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of
She didn't push me into coming
Why are you doing this to yourself
don't even know why 'm afraid, Uncle Charles
can't even remember when it started
Don't you think it's time  found out and got over it
He takes a measured pause
Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it
'm staying
He's not going to change her mind
-    ( & / ) through a porthole window
and through the viewfinder of a video camcorder
McCulloch shakes his head, turning away from Rennie and walking away
sinister electric guitar solo screeches out
with McCulloch as he passes the window, coming around 180 degrees into a of

She's wearing a black leather corset, with wildly teased deep red hair
Holding the camcorder is  , -acclimated, wearing the latest hip prescription glasses
Too cool,
Your parents came through
She pops out the guitar cable from her practice amp
No lie
hear there's a big power room down below where  can get supreme concert hall echo
Come down and shoot a basement tape on me, okay
Sure
but  gotta shoot some shockumentary footage first
He avoids eye contact when he says it
She gives him a look
Man, don't tell me you're still trying to scam on Tamara
His non-answer means yes
walks over to him, grabbing his cheeks, shaking them like jello
How long have we known each other
Don't be a dweeb, Wayne
She's not interested in you, only what you can do for her
She's a user
She's sexy
So's this guitar
So what
'll catch you later
He exits
She mumbles something under her breath, coiling up her amp cord
- as he walks onward
to find his  as he passes a
which happens to have leading into it
Camera the footprints,  again and with dim recognition, our eyes fall on
Lurking in the shadows
But not for long
- Massive, very dark, backlit steam seeping from a maze of pipes overhead
No windows
wall of circuit breakers and voltage meters decorate one wall, quietly humming generators on the opposite side
appears with her guitar, amp and ghetto blaster, appreciative of the surroundings
This place is aching for a video
Wayne, you're an asshole
She finds an outlet and plugs in her equipment
' We're peering at
predatorially through the steam, moving through it, behind the generators
pops a cassette into her blaster, jamming the "play" button
loud rock 'n roll rhythm track blasts out
' moving around the generators, eyeing her sleek leather pants as she bends over to plug in her axe
as
snaps the male end of the plug into the female
receptacle
' appears for an instant through the vapor, then vanishes
screams out the opening licks of her solo in sync with her playback
The generators are causing a breeze which makes her hair dance, steam flowing between her legs
She's lost in her music, building to a crescendo, bending the high "" string above the upper octave fret
She opens her eyes with the pleasure of it and sees: emerging from a cloud of vapor like her worst nightmare
- as
's  echoes from an exhaust duct
to find the crazed   standing just below it, reacting with dread
He's the only one who has heard it
- as Jason tears the guitar off her body, raising it in the air like a hatchet
The horrified girl flees down a narrow maze of steel steps, forced back against a generator with nowhere to go
on her face for one last look at her before: swings the guitar downward and buries it in
's skull
- as the Deck Hand flinches upon the thick, dull sound of her demise, followed by discordant feedback from her guitar
and eventual silence
He reaches into his breast pocket, his hand shaking badly as he sips from a flask of Early Times
-  () as   over a gray, choppy sea
storm is imminent
The Princess Ruby finally appears, cutting through whitecaps, no land in sight
- as Rennie's hand carefully dips it in India ink, moving to a blank page in her journal
She hesitates for several beats
'  - No inspiration
She puts down the pen, looking at her dog, who's curled up on the bed
What do you think
time for some personal experiences to fuel our minds
The dog's eyes blink, but no more than that
agree
Rennie moves to her closet, finding a silk blouse and some black satin pants
- Wind is picking up, sweeping thick mist past a row of decorative flags
One of them flaps back '  (  ) as the flag whips our faces
We  through it, down the empty passageway, coming to a porthole window
Rennie's window
We peer through it with unnerving intensity at the backside of Rennie as she pulls off her -shirt, slipping on the blouse
Camera continues through the tiny round window, floating across the room, over Toby and the bed
until we're '
She suddenly spins around in fright, facing us point-blank, and: Nobody is there, her porthole window empty
But there's something surreal about the window
() Empty grayness
then ,
The porthole has become a window into the depths of Crystal Lake
feels her throat catch with terror and an instant later: begins to bark vociferously, rushing to her cabin door, scratching to get out
' are distracted to Toby for a second; when she looks back at the porthole, she sees: No water, no drowning boy
snaps out of it, moving to the door, where her dog is frantically clawing with his fur up
Okay Toby, calm down
She's talking to herself as much as the dog
Rennie closes the curtains on her window, then steps to her door
She swings the door open for Toby
and exposes an empty hall
Toby scrapes his way out of the room, dashing off down the hall, snarling
- as Toby runs straight toward us
with him as he rushes around a corner, leading us into a view of and , disappearing down a staircase
- strong seventeen year-old black kid,  , is going a few rounds with another senior boy who's clearly losing the boxing match
Julius dances around him on the mat like he's Mike Tyson, several other boys cheering them on
- as Tamara and Eva step into view
Eva glances around, feeling out of place in the men's locker room
'm not sure we're supposed to be here, Tamara
couple of skinny boys wearing only towels walk by
But Tamara doesn't notice them, her face pressed up against the glass, watching Julius
Is that a muscular bod or what
Tamara puts on a sexy smile
The other boxer sees her instead, instantly distracted
Julius lays him out with a left-right-left combination
The onlookers applaud
Julius pulls out his mouthpiece, giving Tamara a wicked smile
He's undefeated, you know that
(beat) Julius is the only senior 'd even consider doing it with
If he wasn't black, that is
(awkward) My parents are open minded about that sort of thing
My stepmom couldn't care less, but Daddy would have a shit fit
(lets it slip out) He might even pay some attention to me
Tamara quickly puts up her veneer again, spotting something
Gorgeous guy at ten o'clock
Look sensual
Both girls slip into instant sultry as a   in his mid-twenties passes them, wearing a tool belt
Very masculine
He gives the girls a pleasant smile
Tamara turns around to check out his back side
think it's time for some recreational activity, girl
Sounds good
hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool
You're joking, right
She wasn't, but Eva tries to act like she was
Tamara walks on, Eva following
- as McCulloch steps from Rennie's room, looking very worried
Wayne Webber passes by, his eye stuck in his viewfinder
McCulloch yanks the camcorder away from his face
Have you seen my niece anywhere
Yeah, motivating downstairs,  think
What's the problem, Mr
McCulloch
Senior predictions started five minutes ago and she hasn't shown up
Some of us don't want our futures predicted
In your case 'm sure that's true
He brushes past Wayne angrily
- as Tamara drags Eva into a secluded service area, pulling out her mirror, straw and baggie
The night time is the right time
Tamara hands the straw to Eva
(nervous) No thanks
What
Don't be a lightweight
this is top dollar toot
It's not that, it's just that
(beat) It  get caught, 'll lose my science scholarship and everything
You're talking to the prom queen, Eva
Do you really think 'm going to risk getting caught
(a pause) guess not
Do you realize how many people would kill to be sitting here right now
Come on, it's grad night
You've got your whole life to be uptight
Eva takes the straw
as we move down the corridor, in and out of shadows, hearing giggles from Tamara and Eva up ahead
Jason's coming
- as Eva takes a nosefull, sneezing badly
Is that unbelievable or what
Tamara giggles, getting ready to tap out another line
But the snickering stops upon the sound of They both look up, every muscle tensing with fear as: appears from the shadows, just as startled to see them
It's not Jason at all
Rennie can't help noticing the cocaine, trying hard to ignore it
Jesus, you scared the hell out of us
Have you seen my dog
think he came this way
No, we haven't
(awkwardly) Care for a hit
No thanks
Rennie continues on
After she's gone
real space cadet
wonder if she'll narc on us
have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice
Nobody related to McCulloch can be nice
Tamara puts the straw to her nose
- as she presses on, the corridor getting darker
Toby
No reply
She walks on, turning down the left hallway
but camera turns down the right hallway
Suddenly , quietly stepping from the
He's holding a pool cue, which he proceeds to snap in half, providing a splintery sharp shaft
- as Tamara finishes off her line, wiping her nose with a sniffle
Oh yeah
Ready to party and then some
She rolls up her baggie, stuffing it into her purse
as we come down a corridor, turning into the Service Area, stomping right up to Tamara and Eva
They both ; Tamara drops her mirror, which  on the ground
They are facing McCulloch
What are you doing in here
Nothing
He eyes the broken mirror
He wasn't born yesterday
Are you girls using drugs
Do you think  would use drugs, Mr
McCulloch
We were just exploring the ship
He doesn't want to believe Eva is a druggie
But Tamara is a different matter
He levels his eyes on her
'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss Mason
You'd better have your biology project ready or 'm phoning your parents
They're out of town
Then 'll make sure you remain on board while your classmates see the sights
He's gotten to her with that one
McCulloch storms away
What are you going to do
Relax, 've got McCulloch covered
but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter
(calculating) Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid of the water
as a body pierces the surface of the deck swimming pool
It's , having just completed a dive from the high board
Miss Van Deusen and several others stand at poolside, giving him some applause
Poetry in motion, Miles
half-twist short
'll hone that dive yet
He swims to the side, leading us to a view of Rennie
She's very cautious about getting too close to the pool edge as she approaches Miss Van Deusen
Rennie --  was just on my way over to your room Have you seen my dog anywhere
No, but 'm sure Toby's fine
The ship's only so big and there's certainly no way off it, is there
She smiles reassuringly, but her words are less than comforting
-    - as the canine continues to sniff out Jason through the maze of corridors
with the dog as he slows his pace, knowing he's getting close to something
'    () Low to the ground, creeping past a steam vent which obscures his vision, then turning down a metal staircase, weaving into another passageway
Then with absolutely no warning,     , rears back with teeth bared, but: is quite dead: Toby is snarling at the corpse of the who lost his bout against Julius
He's still in his boxing shorts
' - as they walk along the edge of the pool
So, are you having fun yet
(lying) Yeah
a lot
seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone
(beat) In other words, level with me
(a pause) There's something  haven't told you
But before she can begin the next sentence, Rennie is shoved from behind
as she    '
spins around, seeing Tamara standing there with Eva
Wow, sorry
flounders at the surface, nobody realizing the terror she's experiencing
She's too scared to even cry for help
isn't looking at Rennie, her attention on admonishing Tamara
Why on earth would you do something like that
It was an accident,  swear
Eva avoids eye contact, feeling awful
Sean comes walking up, seeing Rennie
What happened
(to Rennie) Rennie, are you okay
' She's can't even hear Sean, her vision being splashed by the chlorinated water
She sinks under the surface, turning around The eight year-old corpse ' as Rennie sinks under the surface, all alone, thrashing in terror
realizes she's in trouble
He immediately dives in after her, pulling her to the pool's edge, where Miss Van Deusen helps to lift her out
quickly move on
That was truly excellent
(feels like shit) Yeah
Time to check out the waiters
think 'll pass
See you later, okay
But
wait a minute
Eva walks away
Tamara acts angry, but deep down she's hurt
Some friend you are
- as Sean climbs from the pool to join Miss Van Deusen, who is trying to comfort Rennie
(to Sean) Bring her a towel, okay
Sean nods, hurrying off as others start to crowd around
Miss Van Deusen looks up at them
She's fine -- everybody go back to what you were doing
They disperse
Rennie slowly starts to cry, holding tight to her teacher
Care to talk about it
After a moment to compose herself
can't swim
gathered that
Rennie says nothing else
Miss Van Deusen knows she's holding out
had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg
It took three winters before  would even look at the snow again
but the solution kept eluding me
(beat) finally took lessons
've never broken a bone since
It's not that simple
Maybe not
But you're not telling me everything, are you
(long pause) Whenever  get near the water,  see this young boy drowning
He tries to pull me down with him
The teacher didn't expect this, taking a thoughtful pause
When did this start
About four years ago
at Crystal Lake
spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school
After your parents passed away
Rennie nods somberly
Did you have an accident in the lake
No
It was just a normal summer
've never been able to figure it out
Only one young boy ever drowned in that lake, and that was before you were even born
His name was Jason Voorhees
The name has triggered some deep memory
but the recollection vanishes upon the sound of her uncle's voice
(
) Dear God
as McCulloch rushes over to Rennie, seeing that she's soaked
He's livid
She's fine, Charles
Take it easy
Oh,  can see that
You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen
It wasn't her fault
He gets Rennie to her feet just as Sean runs back with a towel
McCulloch grabs it from him, wrapping it around his niece, facing both Miss Van Deusen and Sean
Stay away from her
both of you
He starts to lead her away
The crazy   blocks their path, slipping his flask away
He's come back and you're all going to die
Rennie gazes at the Deck Hand, then back at McCulloch
Just
leave me alone
She pulls away from him, hurrying off, confused and frightened
McCulloch's retinas pierce the Deck Hand with scorn
He checks his watch, then storms off
'  - as a loud, firm  punctuates the silence
Then comes a sultry voice
(
) The door's open
McCulloch swings it open
'm in no mood for any more stall tactics, Miss Mason
Where is your final project
as Tamara fills a pair of champagne glasses with a bottle of Dom Perignon
She's wearing a full body robe
Wouldn't you like a glass of champagne first, Charles
He's about to lose his temper
McCulloch steps closer
Where did you get that alcohol
packed it
Just for us
- as we approach Tamara's porthole window, peering through it
We can't hear the words but we can clearly see the people
'  - as McCulloch takes the bottle from her, setting it down on her nightstand
That's it
You're not setting foot off this ship until we return home
But  haven't even shown you my biology project
Tamara unties her robe
to the floor with it as it softly piles at her bare feet
- as the   quickly blurs past the window
McCulloch is flabbergasted, too stunned to fully react
Tamara is wearing a layered teddy, which she's beginning to unsnap, exposing her lithe body
but that's not all
Tamara has drawn all her major organs on her bare skin
Take a closer look, Charles
want to make sure  labeled all my organs correctly
'  - as we approach her door, still cracked open from McCulloch's entrance
We get there just in time to see Tamara slip her arms around McCulloch, planting her lips on his, pressing her nubile flesh up against his stiffly starched shirt
'  - as she holds him tight
He finally breaks away in a fit of anger
Oh, you've done it now
Not only are you going home, 'll see to it that you spend next year back in a high school classroom
He storms for the door, swinging it open, coming face to face with: who casually lowers his camcorder
don't think so, Mr
McCulloch
(to Wayne) Did you get anything good
His eyes are unable to leave her nakedness
Oh yeah
She quickly slips on her robe again, all business
McCulloch realizes what has just transpired
You'll never get away with it
(eyeing Wayne) And you can forget about ever attending any film school
(serious beat) You're both going to be very, very sorry
He storms off
Wayne looks very, very nervous
Tamara steps over to him, cuddling up
Relax, Wayne
He won't risk doing a thing
(beat) Can  have the tape
He pops the eject button, absently handing it over
Wayne steps into her room, nervous and excited to be there
He lifts the glass of champagne she poured for McCulloch
This is going to sound supremely lame
but 've had the major hots for you since our sophomore year, Tamara
He gulps down the fizz
She forces a smile, stashing the incriminating videotape
That's sweet, Wayne
Look, 'd love to chat but 'm really pressed for time
(ushering him to door) Let's try to get together later, okey- doke
But  thought
Thanks for the camerawork
And out he goes, the door shut in his face
Wayne stands outside her room, realizing he's a major chump
Wayne, you're an asshole
He despondently exits
'  -   () as Tamara heads for the bathroom, slipping off her robe
She moves to the shower curtain and we're right behind her
Her hand reaches up, grabbing the curtain, yanking it back
Nothing is there
-   -  () as Rennie enters, her eyes reddened
She moves to the sink, looking at herself in the mirror
So much for the silk blouse and satin pants, not to mention her soaked hair
Rennie runs some warm water, rinsing her face
When she starts to fill her hands a second time, Rennie gasps, jerking up and seeing ,
It's not real, it's not real
'  - as water from the shower head   for a beat before Tamara turns it off
as Tamara reaches for her robe, slipping it on
Her body paint has been washed off
She steps from the shower, glancing in her vanity mirror Tamara spins around, looking face to face with
Just as she : -   () Young Jason reaches out to grab Rennie, Right when Rennie : '  - The real Jason  ' He grabs a sharp chunk of it, advancing on a whimpering Tamara
Please
please don't
Jason raises the shard above her and just as she - as it blasts loudly in the bleak stormy night
It begins to rain
- as Rennie comes rushing out, right into the arms of
Sean
She clings to him, sobbing as the rain falls over them
It's okay
you're going to be okay
want to go home
want off this ship
After a moment
Me too
(beat) Let's go talk to my Dad
He puts his arm around her, leading her toward the bridge
- as wind and rain pummel the bridge window
Admiral Robertson turns to his Chief Engineer
Let's kick in the stablilizers, Mr
Carlson, and get the seas off the quarter
These kids are in for one hell of a storm
Yes Sir
Activating comfort cruise mode
The Chief Engineer moves to a bank of toggle switches, flipping a row of them
- as a bloodstained  silently removes the rusty harpoon hanging above the map
gets a reflective look in his weary eyes
- How olds your boy now, Carlson
Nineteen months
tremendous age
Take some advice from a salty old man: don't push him too hard
The Chief Engineer nods with a sympathetic smile as the Admiral steps off the bridge, onto the stormy deck, contemplating the sea
The Chief Engineer moves to the radio/intercom console
He lifts a telephone, punching in a three digit number
This is the bridge
Approaching weather suggests we secure the main deck and
His sentence is sharply cut off, his head jerking from excruciating, instant pain
His mouth contorts with words no one will ever hear as he stares into the face of: holding the opposite end of the harpoon
He shoves it forward with one more staccato jerk and: -  ' -- The harpoon's bloody, corroded tip pierces through his once-white uniform
returns to the bridge as  flashes outside
Better have them doublecheck the lifeboat stations as well
Admiral Robertson stops cold upon the sight of Mr
Carlson
He hurries over to him, kneeling down, freezing as a pair of
Admiral Robertson bends his neck upwards to face: hovering over him, now clutching one of the scaling knives
- as Sean and Rennie walk up the corridor leading to the bridge
Can he really take us home
Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for
But  think can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you
What about you
If  go with you, he'll never speak to me again
(beat) But 'm never going to live up to his expectations anyway
so maybe it's the right thing to do
He's made a big decision
Sean takes her hand as they walk on
moving closer and closer to the bridge door, having not the slightest inclination of what's in store for them
knocks on the bridge door
No answer
He's confused
He pushes the door open but something is blocking it
Sean puts his weight into it, shoving hard
as the door slides open, Sean stepping inside
His eyes roil downwards upon seeing    , Oh Jesus
Dad
Sean looks over at the helm
where his father is still sitting in the swivel chair, his back to them
Silent
Sean sidesteps the Chief Engineer's corpse, moving toward his father as Rennie remains frozen in shock
' Slowly walking toward Admiral Robertson
at least he thinks it's his dad because he's unable to see his face
Is it Jason now wearing the uniform
When he's about two feet away from him
reaches out and swivels the chair around
It is his father
Sean staggers backwards, uncomprehending, his senses overloaded
We with him until he's backed into Rennie, clutching onto him tightly
He's
he's dead
'  - as Miss Van Deusen steps up to Rennie's door, gently knocking
Ronnie
just came by to see how you were feeling
No answer
She knocks harder
and it creaks open, unlocked
Rennie
Suddenly the door is jerked from her grasp and swung open
is standing on the other side of it
thought  told you to stay away from her
(holds her ground) Where is she
(accusing) That's a very good question and 'd appreciate an answer
blares out of an intercom speaker next to their heads, causing the teachers to both jump
Sean's unsteady voice immediately follows
(
) Attention everybody, attention
This is Sean Robertson
- Miles is toweling off under the shelter of a gazebo as Sean's voice blares out of a rain-pounded megaphone speaker nearby
(
) There's been
(swallows) What  mean is, this is an emergency
Miles knows he can't be joking around
Wayne comes walking by, covering his camcorder with his jacket
Miles -- have you seen
She was supposed to be jamming down in the power room but
Miles gestures for him to be quiet, listening very worriedly
(
) Repeat, this is an emergency
- as  and two other senior boys finish dressing after a shower, hearing Sean's words reverberate around them
(
) want everybody to meet on the bridge
What the fuck is this
The others shrug, concerned
- The wooden shuffleboard disks are drowning in precipitation
Eva stands alone in the rain, staring at the court as Sean's voice continues
(
) Stay calm, but get here as quick as possible
Walk with a friend if you can
Eva wipes the rain from her face, then walks away
- trying his best to keep it together
He glances at his dead father, still unable to believe it
(
) God,  wish this was a joke, but it's not
Sean slowly puts down the phone
He's lost in a daze
Suddenly the  , a huge swell Admiral Robertson's body falls from the swivel chair
What is happening
Sean regains his balance, moving to the computer console, looking at the  and  like he's never seen them before
don't know
we've gone off course or something
What do you mean
Another wave hammers the bow
She's in a state of awful panic
don't know what  mean
All's  know is that there's no one guiding this ship anymore
Sean is starting to lose it
The fear of the ocean guiding her, Rennie rushes to him, gripping and shaking him
Can't you call for help
Sean tries to get a grip and assess the situation, pacing frenetically
think so
But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any further
Where are they
The bow
front of the ship
There's a hoist on each side that lowers them She starts to exit
didn't mean for you to go
Just radio for help, okay
She hurries out the door, working on terror-induced adrenaline
Sean rushes to the radio console, depressing the keying button, speaking into the mike
Mayday, mayday, mayday
as  arrives with the others from the locker room
They react to the dead bodies while Sean continues at the radio
Please
can anybody out there hear me
No response
and  rush in
Sean, what's going on
Then he sees the corpses
He needs no further answer
Jesus Christ
He's too scared to even videotape it
Sean is bombarded with questions as he tries to figure out the radio
Who did this, man
Is the radio even working
Isn't there some international
thing you can do
(suddenly remembers) Channel 16
the distress frequency
(dialing knob) Mayday, mayday, mayday
this is the Princess Ruby
Please, somebody answer
-  () as a    tracks through stormy seas
(
) This is Coast Guard cutter Dallas
What is the nature of your problem, Ruby
- as they hear the voice, reacting, relieved and thrilled
The Captain and Chief Engineer
they've been
they're dead
(
) (a grave-pause) What is your location
don't know
(
) Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or
Yes
(
) The  has a digital printout of your latitude and longitude
Give me the coordinates and we'll be there as quick as we can
Sean hurries to the , reading the numbers
-   -   () as   above it in the night sky
Camera slowly  to find the
second later, '    ,
- as Sean hurries back to the radio, pressing it against his spitless mouth
've got the numbers
(
) Give me the degrees first, followed by minutes and sec
Suddenly his voice is  , followed by
Hello
Are you there
No response
lump sinks into everyone's throat
- as Jason drops the cable he's just torn out, marching onward
- as McCulloch bursts onto the bridge, followed by Miss Van Deusen
demand to know what is going on
Oh dear God
She's seen the bodies
McCulloch follows her glance, paling
He quickly takes charge, pushing through the students
Where's the radio
It's
dead
(
) You're all going to die
All heads spin as the deranged   treads out from a shadowy corridor
You're the last ones
He's come back for you
What are you talking about
The Deck Hand takes a final swig from his flask, dropping it with unsteady hands
Jason Voorhees
There is a collective, disconcerting silence triggered by the infamous name
You're insane, old man
Jason Voorhees has been dead for over thirty years
He walks this ship, here and now
killer walks this ship indeed
And it's certainly none of us
The crazed old man gets his drift
Everyone looks at him suspiciously
McCulloch grabs a   off the wall, taking a step towards him
You're the one who's insane
The raving man flees back the way he came
McCulloch raises the flare gun; Miss Van Deusen grabs McCulloch's arm, stopping him
What are you doing
That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded
(eyeing bodies) It's no coincidence
But that doesn't prove that he's the one
Walking corpses are not real
Yeah, well these dead bodies are sure enough real
(to the others) say we regroup and find this motherfucker before he finds us
There's a murmur; it makes sense
You'll do no
such thing and watch your mouth, young man
'm in charge here
They all look at McCulloch defiantly
School's out, McCulloch
(to the others) Let's go
Julius walks off the bridge; all the seniors follow except Sean
Please everybody, stay here
They don't listen
McCulloch starts to go after them
and then it hits him: Christ
where's Rennie
She's
she's dropping the anchors thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if
What
You sent her out there with a murderer running around loose
- as Rennie moves past wet, empty lounge chairs towards the bow
She passes a row of translucent windows
The first three are normal
but the fourth has the He begins to stride parallel to her, then disappears when the windows end and a wall takes over
- as Julius and his followers continue on, passing Eva, who's coming up from a staircase
She stops Wayne
What's going on
heard on the
system that
(interrupting) The Captain's been murdered
The buzz is that Jason might be on board
Jason
Voorhees
She knows the legend as weld as everybody else
Wayne nods gravely, moving to catch up with the others
Eva rushes up to him again
Have you seen Tamara
No
And 'm not losing any sleep over it
But she might be in trouble
So what else is new
(beat) Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason
Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend
don't care about being hip anymore
She means it
Wayne nods with understanding
'm sorry, but 've gotta find
He hurries on
- as Rennie appears, fighting the wind and rain to get closer to the anchor hoists
- --spying on Rennie like a wolf watching a lamb
We  a few windows down, getting a better view of her
- deciding that the time is right to strike
His hand moves to the bow entrance door knob, slowly turning it, pulling it open
- moving closer to the right anchor hoist, her back to us as well as Jason
She climbs behind the hoist, looking at the consoles
Then suddenly a
Toby
She turns, catching a glimpse of her dog running down the side of the deck
Rennie leaves the hoist, going after Toby
' through the crack in the door, watching Rennie unexpectedly take off
He's about to move after her when ha hears: (
) Tamara
Are you around here anywhere
Jason quietly closes the door
Rennie will have to wait
- as she cautiously walks along, poking her head in every alcove
Tamara
' moving down the same corridor, catching a glimpse of Eva before she turns a corner and disappears
/'  - () Eva steps into the hallway outside Tamara's stateroom
She walks up to Tamara's door, knocking on it
It swings open, unlocked
Tamara
(no response) just want to talk with you
She steps into Tamara's room and we go in with her
The quarters are empty
Eva stands there for a beat, confused and scared
She's about to leave when a causes her to look back at: It slowly swings open
splashing Eva's eyes with grotesque multi-images of Tamara: ,   - shrieks, running back out the door
and sliding to a abrupt halt because He moves toward Eva like a bulldozer
She turns a rapid 180 and sprints in retreat
( ) Gasping for oxygen, Eva has no time to even scream as she flees from the monster, erratically turning down a spiral staircase and running on
'    () chasing after her with the smooth determination of a shark, never letting her get too far in the lead
- Empty for a second, then Eva appears, weaving her way through a maze of corridors and passageways
She races past a sign directing passengers to "
" - --entering the same corridor a beat after Eva exits it in the direction of the disco
He tramples onward
/ () The thudding low frequency of a mesmerizing dance tune precedes Eva as she tears open a door, entering the corridor
as she rushes forward, curving through the shallow passageway and emptying out onto a high tech
flashing Star Wars lighting system assaults her all directions along with the music
She's all alone in here
The lights strobing across her face only accentuate her terror
She spots another door on a small stage, rushing to it
It's locked
- as Jason enters the corridor, decides this is the wrong place to be
She moves for the corridor again and: appears on the corridor steps for a brief second
The spotlight goes black, then flashes on again
Now he's gone
backs away, sliding along the edge of the dance floor like she's on a building ledge
Chaser lights and mirror balls fondle her body as she moves as far away from the point where she last saw him
But: illuminates only ten feet from her, a crimson strobe assaulting his hockey mask
She's on a collision course with him
whirls dizzily to the center of the dance floor upon the sight of him
Camera  with her in 360 degree arcs, on her face
' spiraling counter-clockwise on the dance floor, flashes of Jason materializing where she least expects to see him
And getting closer
Finally at the point of exhaustion: stops, looking everywhere
' He seems to be gone
She catches her breath
then sensing his presence, she revolves a half-turn to face: exploding under a pin spotlight, standing directly before her
His forearms recoil with lightning speed as he grips her throat
- Thundering music
Frantic lights
And Jason and Eva at the center of it all
- , Finally Eva's legs go rag doll limp
Jason flings her to the ground like a sack of flour
This dance is over
- Rennie appears again, scanning her no-visibility surroundings
Toby
Where'd you go
No sign of her dog
She remembers her mission, heading to the anchors again
- as Rennie arrives on the bow, climbing into the left hoist box behind the huge anchor cable
moving up to the bow door like Jason did before, cracking it open, seeing Rennie from behind
And moving towards her
is oblivious as she reads the directions above the controls
-   ( ) as Rennie's hand grabs it, shoving it forward
-    ( ) moment later, her thumb finds it and depresses it
-   ( ) as the massive black chain links thunder to life
He's now within ten feet of the unaware girl
remains in the hoist box, making certain it is operating correctly
second later, we see the fleeting outline of a   appear behind her
Three feet from Rennie
She spins around to climb out of the hoist box and
She's facing
He immediately reaches past her, yanking the lever back to its center position, and: ( ) grinds to a halt
as McCulloch faces her, angrily grabbing Rennie's arms, shouting over the storm
You had me worried to death
But Sean said
'm the one you should be listening to
Do you think dropping an anchor in the middle of a storm makes any sense whatsoever
She tries to find some defense, but McCulloch leads her off before any wards come forth
- as a pair of  , three  , a and several   are dumped onto the foam padded plastic
- where Julius has gathered his small group of vigilantes, including Miles and Wayne
managed to scrounge this shit from the game room and hallways
Grab what you want
Wayne takes one of the rifles; Miles grabs the axe
What are you taking, Julius
(flexes fists) Nothin'
(dead serious) We're talking the possibility of Jason Voorhees here
Julius pauses
He's not stupid
Nothin' but this gun
He reaches down, picking up the other rifle
And they move
/'  - as McCulloch guides his niece down the hallway, swinging her door open
Can't we at least talk about it
refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship
But what about the drowning boy 've been seeing
He avoids eye contact
McCulloch takes her hand, ushering her across the threshold
She's standing inside her room now; he's in the hallway
Whatever you've been
imagining
has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees
(pause) want you to be safe, Rennie
That's all  care about
'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles
This isn't a request
He closes the door on her face, pulling out a key, locking the dead bolt
She pounds on it from the other side
(
) Uncle Charles
He ignores her, briskly walking away
'  - as she throws her fists against the door a final time, realizing it's futile
- Steam continues to seep from the maze of criss-crossing pipes
Wayne appears on one of the catwalks
He's holding the skeet rifle under one arm, using the sun gun off his video camera to guide him
-- you down here
as Wayne carefully lets his light guide him down the precarious walkway
An unexpected blast of steam scares the crap out of him, causing him to stumble
- '  ( ) --They slip off the bridge of his nose, skittering down through the catwalk and pipes to God knows where
lies helplessly on the metal grid work, realizing his bleak predicament has just been squared
He pulls himself to a standing position again
We got a major problem, Wayne
' His vision now gives him shadows and shapes rather than crisp images
He raises the gun and continues unsteadily forward
as Wayne inches forward
Camera slowly , watching him from a catbird seat
takes another step, almost tripping on a set of stairs leading down to the next level
And when he arrives there
' , instantly raises the rifle and
' and the body goes down
He's hit him
stands there, breathing some relief
He gets an idea, looking through his camcorder eyepiece
Wayne begins to adjust the eyepiece diaptor
'    ( & / ) as the figure on the ground slips in and out of focus, finally becoming crisp
-- the same good looking one Tamara and Eva ogled earlier
He's holding a screwdriver from his waist band tool set, not a knife
slowly lowers his camera as his heart rises into his throat
No
He raises his camcorder again, hoping a second view will reveal a dead Jason rather than this young man
'    ( & / ) He gets half his wish: a but Jason is far from dead
Wayne catches a split- second glimpse of Jason's fist coming towards him, then the camera is screams, blindly running as fast as he can
He trips, picking himself up, stumbling down the catwalk stairs
Wayne makes it about ten feet before he stumbles over something, bringing with it a harsh strum from an - ' Sure enough, his left shoe is resting on the pickups of a blood-streaked Gibson Flying
--sprawled out on the metal floor
He gropes around, his hands feeling something
It sends chills from his groin up through his scalp
No no no
Wayne's hands are touching
'  , He doesn't have time to scream or cry because hoists him off of
's body and flings him into: () which shorts out with a fanfare of ,
- as the overhead lights briefly flicker, then resume normal operation
Sean stands opposite the navigational chart, ping-ponging between it and the ship's computers as Miss Van Deusen paces nervously
What was that
(very worried) don't know
(trying not to panic) What happens if we don't get control of the ship, Sean
want you to tell me the truth
(beat) We could hit a reef, collide with another ship
we could be out here for weeks before anybody spotted us
They are suddenly jolted with a   as McCulloch storms onto the bridge
Did you find Rennie
She's locked safe in her room, no thanks to either of you
(like Sean isn't even in the room) Has he brought it back on course yet
Sean doesn't look at him, still trying to assimilate the wall of components
He's doing the best he can, Charles
He's the son of the Captain, for Chrissakes
You'd think he'd be able to operate this thing
Sean closes his eyes, trying to keep from losing his mind and temper
fierce  slaps the windows in front of Sean's face, motivating him to get his shit together
He checks the Omega and
Well
Sean doesn't answer, moving to the seat behind the helm
His father's seat
Sean takes the chair, adjusting the wheel, watching the compass
He studies a series of buttons on the console
- We  across them, stopping on one labeled "  - " Camera continues around to find we are in the  ,  on the bridge
Our vision suddenly lands on , staring at the alarm button, considering
He glances back over his shoulder
'    () Wayne's body is - as Sean makes up his mind, flipping several toggle switches
- as Sean flips the last toggle and a green light illuminates, indicating the   is in effect
It worked
we're back on course
Sean feels his confidence instantly rejuvenated
Miss Van Deuten immediately embraces him
But a fraction of time later: Jason's fist  the alarm button
- and a   cries out across the entire vessel
The blood drains from Sean's face
What's that
The fire alarm
- as the shrieking alarm assaults the main deck, hallways and corridors, giving Julius, Miles and Wayne deep pause for thought
'  - as the alarm bombards Rennie's ears like everybody else's
She hurries to her curtained porthole window, working up the energy to look outside
Rennie gets a grip on them,
The  ' Rennie screams; a second later he hurries off
- as McCulloch tears open a cabinet door labeled The siren continues to blast
Can you shut that damn thing off
Sean moves to a bank of switches, his eyes darting around for the appropriate switch
Miss Van Deusen sees McCulloch remove the   from the cabinet
We already thought of that -- nobody could possibly see it in this storm
There's only one person who needs to see it
And 'm going to find him
What about the fire
doubt very much that one even exists
What are you talking about
Use some common sense
Setting off a fire alarm causes panic
the same kind of panic caused by suggesting Jason Voorhees is on board
(resolved) Enough is enough
He marches out the door
Sean finds the alarm kill switch, flipping it
The excruciating siren vanishes
He grabs a pair of rain jackets, tossing one to Miss Van Deusen
We have to get everybody together just in case the fire's for real
Sean heads for the door, shoving it forward
- as it slams open
and  steps out, not Sean, from a different deck door
with him as he treads along the side of the ship, skeet rifle raised
' walking past the lifeboat stations, the wind and precipitation battering the small boats
With no warning, ,
shoves the gun stock into his shoulder and takes instantaneous aim
but he doesn't shoot
He slowly lowers the rifle
as  lowers the axe
They've just scared the shit out of each other
'll take the upper deck
Julius nods
They separate
Neither boy notices the smoke which is starting to emerge from a deck vent
-  () Filled with black smoke
The fire is spreading dangerously close to a series of hoses attached to a fuel pump, leading to tanks below
sign over them reads: -
- --steaming and far from calm as the weather blitzes it
Miles appears, climbing a ladder to the upper deck level
Someone is spying on Miles from below, watching his every step
- as Miles arrives, axe raised
He pauses to regard his surroundings, then moves on , having followed Miles up the stairs
Only darkness and rain for a beat, then Miles materializes, curving around the gargantuan smokestack
He passes us and we  , now looking at the back of his head
He takes three more steps and Miles senses his presence and ,   ,     ' but Jason easily grabs the axe handle before it makes contact, flinging it away
- He's pacing along when a clattering noise from above makes him stop
Suddenly ' Julius gazes at it, jerking his head upward
Miles
His answer is a
At the same time: He's scrambling as fast as he can across the slippery deck as the monster relentlessly pursues him
' He's having no problem catching up to the defenseless teenager
- as Julius zooms up them to aid his comrade
- as Miles slides up to the mast and begins scaling it
He glances downward and sees: ' Jason is right at his heels
slips on a rung, regains control, and continues upward
He makes it three more steps, almost at the uppermost point when       , Miles cries out as he  , somersaulting and twisting like he's doing one of his better dives
- ' Empty space for a half-second, then ' with a look of ultimate agony
Something has abruptly stopped his fall
Something quite fatal
- coming around a corner, stopping dead in his tracks, his stomach wrenching as his eyes fall on: () who is staring right back at him with dead pupils
doesn't get the chance to grasp the reality of it because '    , The force of it sends the boxer
() and Julius
He's quickly swallowed by the torrential waters
'  - as Rennie's  jiggles her doorknob again, confirming that it's locked tight
to find her desperate face; she begins furiously pacing and we but Rennie stops cold upon hearing: (
) Hhhhelp
me
Rennie whirls into a  , staring with disbelief at: () who is standing on the oval rug in her stateroom, his hands reaching out to her
But then comes the inexplicable: He's drowning in the middle of her room, choking on murky water
Hhhhelp me
'm drowning
stands frozen, feeling herself drawn to him like a magnet
She crawls to the edge of her rug, which is now a deep lake, and extends her arms to him
grabs her hand, pulling hard, then grinning wide
feels the skin on her face crawling off her skull, her eyes expanding because she's now looking at: Rennie is holding onto herself, about four years younger in a bathing suit, drowning in the lake
Hhhhelp
me
screams with guttural fear, letting go of herself, watching her younger self drown in the hole in her room
disappears under the surface of the water
which seconds later
as Rennie moves away, tears rolling down her face, utterly confused
She backs against the wall next to her porthole window and   ' ,
Rennie struggles, gasping for air as he attempts to strangle her
' groping for a weapon to stop him, her fingers skittering across her table like a spider
- Her head is pulled taut against the wall just below the porthole, with Jason's hideous mask framed in the circular shattered window
She's slowly dying
' Her movements slow as the oxygen leaves her system
But Rennie's fingers miraculously find a recognizable object: the ink-dip pen given to her by Miss Van Deusen
She seizes it, getting a firm grip
as Rennie    , Jason instantly releases her, reeling backwards
sinks to the floor, scrambling on all fours to get as far away from the porthole as possible
She makes it across the room to her stateroom door just as: is
She shrieks in terror but it's  who is standing there
Rennie
(pointing) The window
Sean rushes to the shattered porthole, looking out, seeing nothing
He steps back to her
don't understand what is happening to me
She breaks down; he holds her
It's gonna be okay
-  () but Sean couldn't be more wrong
The flames are lapping at the fuel pump and hoses, furiously burning down into the tank
second later the whole thing -  (/
) as a huge  is blown through the thick steel hull: '  - The ship noticeably rocks from the explosion
Rennie clings to him fearfully
What is it
One second later, the lights begin to flicker
The power room
-   () as huge amounts of water rush in from a gaping hole in the hull
- as the overhead lights flicker over McCulloch
There's some fear mixed with the anger as he grips his flare gun, moving onward
Someone is crouched behind a massive convection oven, spying on McCulloch
almost flinches when the lights die and he's plunged into blackness
He moves forward, every step tentative
He passes the convection ovens and we  on them, spotting the frightened face of the   in the shadows
The deranged old man is very sober now, clutching a    for defense
'  - Sean paces feverishly in the blackness of her room, trying to think, talking to himself
Rule one, don't panic
Rule two, assess the damage and act accordingly
Is the ship going to sink
He returns to Rennie, the panic settling back in
don't know
Her ultimate fear is staring her straight in the face
Suddenly the dim blue lights flicker on
The emergency lights just kicked in
Sean makes Rennie look into his eyes
His words are meant to convince himself as much as Rennie
We'll be okay
want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case
(terrified) 'm not going near any lifeboat
But Rennie
'm not
- as Miss Van Deusen gathers a handful of students who are panicking, sitting them down
Everybody wait right here until  come back with the others -- understand
They nod, frightened to death
She dashes away, carrying us into a view of the dining room windows
No one notices the    passing by on the outside desk
-   () Sea water is pouring into the ship's motors
Clouds of steam and black smoke fill the room as the engine bearings begin to
- as McCulloch rushes up to Rennie's already open door, cautiously entering with flare gun raised
Rennie
' The room is empty, shards of the porthole glass scattered across her rug
He steps over to it, bringing his head up to the gaping hole, peering outside
We wait for his attack
but it doesn't come
McCulloch's eyes take us to something across the room
The bathroom door is afar
cautiously steps up to the door, silently grabbing the knob and
It's empty
He hears something, spinning around
Again, nothing is there
McCulloch quickly moves to the telephone and dials
few seconds pass
Come on, answer
- on the bridge telephone, ringing repeatedly , ignoring the phone, scrutinizing the deck below through rain-streaked windows
' Miss Van Deusen is darting across the deck, gathering up a trio of terrified seniors
Jason methodically moves to the bank of switches, studying them
- In large, unmistakable letters over a red button are the words "
" He flips back the plastic safety cover, exposing the button
- horrible grinding sound echoes through the narrow corridor
Sean and Rennie appear at the opposite end, coughing on the black smoke which clouds their passageway
Sean looks down, seeing that they are standing in a puddle of water
Water has gotten to the engines
(coughs) We have to get everybody off this ship
- as Jason presses it with firm deliberation, and: - blasts through the passageway
Sean and Rennie have no time to react because: -  () sealed compartment door () and a
, Sean fights to pull her up, but not in time for her to witness: '   () which bobs up in front of her
Rennie cries out, scrambling to grab onto Sean as what's left of Wayne's body washes past them
- as a door opens and Miss Van Deusen guides a half-dozen over to the
(shouting over storm) Everybody climb in
They follow her orders as the Abandon Ship alarm wretches on
But little do they know that: Someone is briskly moving towards the group and Miss Van Deusen
Just as we are within a few feet of her
--It's  who's approached them
He grabs Miss Van Deusen, shaking her violently
What did you do with Rennie
Nothing
went to her cabin and
McCulloch rushes off before she can finish
Miss Van Deusen turns back to the other kids, helping them into the boat
Everybody hurry
please
-     - We slowly   until Miles'  comes into frame, still stuck in the mahogany decking
beat, then '
- as Sean climbs up from below, soaked to the bone, pulling up a half-conscious Rennie
Sean carries her around a corner, where he collides with McCulloch
McCulloch pulls Rennie away from him
She never should've set foot on this ship
This is your fault
This is Jason's fault
(shouting) Not another word, do you hear me
- as Miss Van Deusen throws the "down" lever and the lifeboat hoist begins to lower the boat
Camera - - One of the students screams, the others clinging together upon the sight of this infamous monster
But the boat is already over the edge, past the point of return
And lowering at a snail's pace
turns to see
She backs away but Jason ignores her, heading directly for the hoist
He arches back with his weapon and -   ( ) as Jason's axe     , and: / () The bow cable , They last about five seconds before succumbing to a drowning death
sees it all, her intestines constricting in agonizing knots
She summons all her rationale and sends it down to her legs, running away as fast as she can
' --knocking down deck tables, chairs and chaise lounges as she flees
The creative writing teacher swerves around a column, heading for an interior door, sliding to a stop as it
McCulloch steps outside, carrying Rennie, with Sean right behind her
Rennie is conscious now, squirming free of her uncle upon the sight of Miss Van Deusen
as Rennie rushes into Miss Van Deusen's arms
The teacher holds her, beginning to cry herself
Why aren't you with the others, woman
Finally the message comes forth: Jason
he has an axe
His face grows taut with anger
Jason Voorhees is dead
immediately cries out behind them, the words unintelligible
They turn around to witness      , raises the flare gun with zero hesitation and
-   () and the charge
He stands there with his chest smoldering, almost like a gargoyle in effigy
second later the poor old man falls forward, and: () They all see that ' McCulloch gazes with utter disbelief
Dear Christ
We have to get off this ship
They back away from the horrid sight and begin to run, the Abandon Ship alarm still attacking their ears
- as McCulloch, Miss Van Deusen, Rennie and Sean scramble to the closest lifeboat
Everybody in -- 'll get the hoists McCulloch has no time for politeness, moving to the lifeboat ahead of the women
Rennie stops cold, gazing classy-eyed at the small boat
Come on, sweetheart -- get in
But she doesn't budge
McCulloch levels wild eyes on her, quickly climbing back down
Get in the boat, Rennie
can't
(shaking her) You can and you will
He tries to slap her out of it, dragging her over to the boat, ignoring her terror-stricken frenzy
Stop it
Leave her alone, Charles
Miss Van Deusen quickly moves to a hysterical Rennie and holds her, eyeing McCulloch vehemently
-      - as rain begins to wash the blood from his back
' then his   , '
- as Rennie clings to	 Miss Van Deusen, crying
It's the only way, Rennie
Let's get in the boat now, okay
Please
for me
Rennie finds herself nodding
Miss Van Deusen helps the trembling girl up the steps, an angered McCulloch right behind
- as Rennie climbs over the boat edge, Toby is curled up in the corner of the lifeboat, teeth bared
Toby
She climbs in, moving to her equally, relieved dog, McCulloch and Miss Van Deusen right behind her
-   ( ) as Sean jabs it and the hoist motor kicks in
-   () just as a huge    cracks over the smoke stack and upper deck
steps out from behind it, gaping down on them with frightening omnipresence
Gripping the bloody axe
- Sean climbs in the boat as it continues to lower
He takes one look back at the ship and sees: rapidly moving down the staircase towards them
Sean's view is   as the lifeboat sinks below deck level
as Sean's eyes dart around, down to the sea, up at the hoist
Come on
faster
' trampling towards the hoist, about thirty feet away now
The boat has already disappeared over the edge
/  -  () as the lifeboat continues to lower, about ten feet from making contact with the tumultuous ocean
The ship's hull is crooked and sinking
as he relentlessly moves to the hoist cable, raising his axe
/  () as the ship finally touches water, and: -   ( Jason's axe blade
/  () and the hoist cable falls limply over them
Jason's too late
Sean looks up and sees: standing by the hoist, hovering over the edge
Very angry
() grabs an oar, turning back to McCulloch
Start rowing
McCulloch takes the oar as Miss Van Deusen holds onto Rennie tightly, the girl's eyes squeezed shut
Sean looks up at the ship again, and: ' Jason is none
/  () Sean looks around with confusion as huge waves, wind and rain pummel them
He's gone
() or is he
We're moving towards the lifeboat at water level, almost like a shark preparing for attack
() Sean breathes with some relief, resuming his rowing with McCulloch
They get about three strokes apiece before: () lunges from under the ocean surface, grabbing onto Sean
Everybody
but it's , gasping for oxygen, spitting up seawater
Sean pulls him over the edge
It's Julius
Miss Van Deusen moves to help him and we: : -   -  ( ) The ship is gone now, the lifeboat a speck in the ocean
-  (
) The water is less rough now, the rain replaced with fog
Julius has taken McCulloch's place behind an oar; McCulloch is flanking his shivering niece with Miss Van Deusen
(miserable) If we don't find the shore soon we're all going to die
Sean tries to ignore him, keeping his mind on rowing
(unable to hide fear) Do you know where we are, Sean
Sean pauses, utterly exhausted
He thinks for a moment, remembering his father's gift
Sean reaches into his coat pocket, removing the pocket navigational calculator
He stares at it long and hard
Julius looks over at him, seeing that Sean is on the verge of tears
He grips his shoulder
Hey man, if  can make it, so can
you
Sean slowly nods, turning on the calculator
: -  () as the lifeboat rows into frame, the water relatively calm
-  () McCulloch, Rennie and Miss Van Deusen are asleep, Sean and Julius rowing on sheer will power
Sean takes one more stroke, feels himself passing out, then regains his coherence again
Julius glances off the side of the ship for no particular reason, then does a doubletake
'    (  -
) They are rowing right past    , illuminated in all its glory
() Julius feels his eyes widening and a huge smile taking control of his haggard face
He tugs on Sean's sleeve, his eyes never leaving the monument
Hey man, wake up
Check it out
The other stir as well, opening their eyes, not sure if it's some kind of vision or if they are genuinely here
God damn, we're in New York
You did it, my man
Julius howls with delight, Miss Van Deusen hugging Rennie as Julius gives Sean the high-five
Toby barks
-    -  (  -
) as the lifeboat rows toward the very famous skyline of Manhattan, twinkling in the near distance
We can hear the faint sound of Julius singing "New York, New York," relieved to be alive
They're going to make it
-   () as the sound of Julius' voice grows fainter
The water begins to ripple
then the top half of a ,
And swimming onward
- as Julius and Sean row the lifeboat up to a narrow barge beneath deserted dock warehouses
They are not in the safest part of town by a longshot
as they climb onto the barge
Rennie breathes with relief as she steps off the boat
She takes a final glance back at it and sees: flailing her arms in the water right next to the lifeboat, drowning
Hhhhelp
me
Suddenly a      , ,
- She gazes in utter shock, screaming: No
They all follow her eyeline
but the water is calm, nothing there
(holding her) It's okay
you're safe now
McCulloch grits his teeth
Come on -- everybody up the ladder
He's the first one up
Sean looks at Rennie, concerned, then hoists Toby up in his arms
They all begin climbing the ladder
- as the last pair of feet disappear over the top edge of the dock
Camera  back down the rungs, finding the lifeboat and barge again
Suddenly ,
He gazes up at his new surroundings, quite different from all the years he's spent at Crystal Lake
But an item at the far end of the dock causes him the longest pause
' tattered billboard over one of the warehouses advertises the     , featuring a full shot of the -
looks at it long and hard
He tears off his life preserver wits renewed ambition
-     - as Jason heads up the ladder
He's about to take Manhattan
- as our survivors head into an isolated, foreboding group of dock warehouses and alleys
There must be a phone around here somewhere
wonderful choice of places to dock a boat, Mr
Robertson
Sean looks away, trying to keep from losing his temper
'    - We're spying on them from behind a stack of crates as they come in our direction
Waiting for the right moment
as they move towards the stack of crates
Without warning, a      , Nervous young druggies
#1 Hands up
#2 Do it
All hands go up
Gang Banger #2 grabs McCulloch's watch and wallet, skimming through a wad of bills and credit cards while #1 keeps them covered
#2 Got some good shit here, holmes
#1 (eyeing Rennie) You got that right
He steps over to Rennie, brushing her hair back with the barrel of his revolver, spotting the Statue of Liberty pendant Sean gave her
# Now ain't that sweet
He tears it off her neck, pocketing it
Sean angrily moves toward him and Gang Banger #l shoves the barrel against Rennie's temple
#1 Go ahead, superman
Be a hero
Sean has no choice but to freeze
Julius flexes his fists, but he too has Gang Banger #2's gun leveled on him
McCulloch stares at the thugs with obvious contempt
It doesn't go unnoticed
# You got a problem, Dad
McCulloch offers some rare silence, shaking a "no" to the gun-toting kid
Rennie's dog-begins to growl, backing away, ready to defend her
Gang Banger #1 points his barrel at Toby with zero conscience, cocking back the hammer
No
She pushes his arm to the side just as the bullet - as the bullet tears up asphalt next to the dog's paws
Toby sprints off into the darkness
Gang Banger #1 grabs Rennie by the hair, brutally jerking her head back
Please, don't hurt her
# Hurt this princess
(beat) Would  do that
They cough out laughs
Gang Banger #1 looks into Rennie's eyes, his barrel still on her skin
#1 You look like a party girl, princess
How'd you like to go on a date with me and my friend
If you're free, that is
More phlegm-filled laughs
He drags her away, Gang Banger #2 backing away with him with his gun still trained on the others
#2 You follow and we'll blow her fuckin' head off, comprende
The others watch helplessly as Rennie is abducted
We can't let those gang-bangers get away, man
Julius starts to move after them
McCulloch grabs him
You heard him
We have to call the police Julius jerks away from McCulloch's grasp
But he knows McCulloch	is right
Everyone split up -- we'll cover more ground that way
don't think that's such a safe idea My niece's life hangs in the balance right now
Every second counts
No more rebuttal
They hurry off
'  - It's a narrow passageway between warehouses
decrepit brownstones with shattered chicken-wire windows, moss growing on the bricks
The Gang Bangers appear with Rennie, dragging her down some concrete steps
# Welcome to the casbah, princess
with them as they walk through a thick blanket of  which pours out of a factory vent
We through the mist with them, revealing a tattered, rain- soaked couch and chair, upholstery shredded
spool once used for telephone wire functions as their coffee table
They splash through puddles, throwing her down on the couch
--looking back at the steam vent - as a yellowish liquid squirts out the dirty needle to find Gang Banger #2 holding it with transfixed eyes, his compadre holding a squirming Rennie down on the couch, tearing back her jacket to reveal a bare arm
Please don't
#1 Loosen up, baby
It'll feel way better if you're stoned
'  - Amongst the slime and cigarette butts is a discarded syringe
Jason picks it up
- just as Gang Banger #2 jabs Rennie with the needle
Gang Banger #1 wrestles off his torn leather jacket, pushing Rennie back on the exposed foam padding as his friend watches excitedly
#1 Slang us some more 'caine, JoJo
We're in for a long night
Gang Banger #2 runs out the back way

Just before contact he ,
Jason is standing right behind him, shoving something into his back, out of frame
He thrusts it again, bringing with it one more horrific grunt from the kid
Jason goes for number three and: -   #1'  () Jason's syringe gets shoved completely through him, the needle sticking out his front side
opens her eyes, looking into the dead boy's face as blood drips from his mouth
He collapses in front of her, giving way to a view of
At the same time: #2 comes around the corner
#2 Forgot my money, holmes
Ha stops dead in his tracks at the sight of Jason
#2 Who the fuck are you
Jason paces toward him
The kid glances at his dead friend arched over the couch, quickly whipping out his 38
#2 You're dead, fuckhead
but Jason keeps on coming
Five shots later and Jason's still standing, easily picking up the slime ball and
The kid falls in a bloody heap
shoves Gang Banger #1 off of her as Jason returns his attention to her
She grabs a loose brick and ,    , momentarily disorienting him
Rennie sprints away
#1 -  ( ) as Julius runs into view, looking down a menacing alley, spotting a phone booth
He hurries for it
' Like a cat watching a bird, we watch Julius head for the booth
slams open the booth door, grabbing the receiver, punching the "operator" digit
on him as he waits for an answer
Several more rings
'mon
Finally a click and muffled words from the operator
Get me the police -- this is an emergency
as '      , Julius grips Jason's scaly arm with all his strength, staring at the cracked hockey mask framed in the shattered window
Julius summons all his strength, tearing free of Jason's grasp and running out the door
The phone is left dangling
( ) with no apparent direction
Literally running for his life
He's just as quick, but smoother and more methodical
'    ( ) heading up the alley, spotting a fire escape, diverting his course straight for it
- as Julius   , dragging himself up, climbing as fast as is humanly possible
- but Jason is-far from human, easily negotiating the wrought-iron stairs and rapidly catching up
- as Julius' head appears, clawing his way onto the tar- papered surface, running to the opposite side
second later,
as Julius soon learns the awful truth that the only way up is the only way down
with the exception of a head- splitting freefall
No way is he gonna jump
Julius turns back to Jason, raising his fists, psyching himself up for the fight of his life
He whispers to himself: Use the combos and keep the feet light
, man against monster, each sizing the other up
Jason takes the first swing, Julius deftly dodging him and countering with left-right-left combination
They have absolutely no effect
Julius follows up with a round of kidney punches
Again, nothing
Julius finds himself being forced back against the rings, which in this case is the edge of the roof
He risks a glance backwards and sees: ' It's a long, rough way down
It's do or die time
as Julius      , forcing him back to the center of the rooftop, spending every last ounce of his energy in doing so
He throws one more feeble punch, knowing it's his last
Take your best shot, motherfucker
Jason gladly obliges, winding up and recoiling with a punch none of us expected
'  () gets literally knocked off his shoulders, cascading off the edge of the rooftop, and: - --the decapitated head lands on a sloped roof below, rolling down towards street level and falling into a garbage-filled dumpster
#2 - as Rennie dizzily runs down the alley, the effects of the drugs kicking in
'    ( ) Blurry, disoriented, erratic
Suddenly It's
He rushes to her, sensing her disorientation
Rennie
what'd they do to you
Drugs
(serious pause) Then Jason came
He's here, Sean
Oh Jesus
He never expected this
We have to find the others
Together they run off
#3 -  ( ) as Miss Van Deusen briskly walks below us, far from relaxed in this threatening environment
She moves forward, the only sound being her shoes against wet asphalt
Four more steps, then a , Freeze
to find a uniformed   standing there, service revolver raised
McCulloch steps out from the alcove as well, recognizing Miss Van Deusen
It's okay -- she's with me
She turns around, lowering her hands, utterly relieved
My apologies, Miss
My unit's right over here
They head through an    towards a concrete wall with stairs; about six feet above the wall is an upper street, where his patrol car is parked
They get halfway through the lot when they hear: (
) Hey
as Sean and Rennie run to join them from the alley
McCulloch rushes to his niece
Rennie, thank God
But Rennie goes to Miss Van Deusen instead
It's a bitter pill for McCulloch
Jason's here in New York
Don't be ridiculous
Is it true, Rennie
She nods, unable to repress her fear
Is this the lass in question
(stewing) Yes
Who is
Jason
He's a walking corpse, a phantasm from hell
The others stare at McCulloch angrily
Miss Van Deusen turns to the confused policeman
'm afraid you'll have some trouble believing us
So try me
- parked above the abandoned garage, the interior dark
The Cop and our heroes appear in the background, coming towards it
You're right --  find it a tall tale indeed
But you seem like honest folks so 'm inclined to believe at least some of it
(relieved) Thank you
The first thing we' have to do is find Julius
'm sure he'll pop up soon enough
Why don't you climb in the back while radio for backup
but even in this darkness, we see that it's empty
They climb in
The Cop opens his drivers door, and
-   ( ) The car dome light blinks on, and
- Our four survivors' faces are brightly illuminated, because: () Julius' severed head is resting on the dash board, staring back at them
- reacting to their terror, seeing Julius' head, quickly grabbing the radio mike
But he has no time for a message because         , ' ,
The radio is still in his grasp
-   ( ) as the radio cord grows taut, finally snapping
The Irish cop's awful yell echoes over it, silencing after a sick
- The foursome instantly try to flee the car, but police cars have no door handles in the back
There aren't any handles
Cocaine flowing through her veins, Rennie acts hyperkinetically, scratching her way over the seats just as: appears at the parking lot stairs, - There is no time for escape
Rennie finds the ignition and fires it up, jamming it into drive and Julius' head rolls off the dash, onto the floorboards
'    ( ) Her vision is still a stoned one but clear enough to set her target
We come straight at the abominable creature and: () Jason is mowed down
slams on the brakes, jerks it into reverse and () as the automobile grinds back over him a second time
stomps on the brake pedal and the tires They all take a moment to catch their breath, looking out the front window
Jason lies dead on the asphalt
For about two seconds
He desperately throws it into forward again, gripping the wheel and
( ) Jason's standing there for one second, but the next moment he is
( ) and the squad car      , #3 -  ( ) as the car bottoms out, then swerves into a sharp right turn, racing down the alley
( ) as Jason appears at the end of the alley, blocking their retreat
- as Rennie stomps the brake pedal, jerking it into reverse
#3 -  ( ) as she backs up, changes gears and races down an intersecting alley
( ) speeding towards an escape when
He's everywhere all at once
- slamming on the discs one more time, flooring it into reverse
-  ( ) as the squad car's rear tires smoke and spin, finally gripping pavement
( ) as we fly backwards
and
--Rennie's terrified face filling it, seeing that Jason is in back of them
( ) as they screech to a halt one final time, rapidly rotating in the opposite direction and speeding out of frame
- Rennie is almost maniacal now, her knuckles white around the vinyl wheel, her foot practically mashed through the floorboard
Rennie, for God's sake slow down
She doesn't hear him, or anything for that matter
Her eyes remain straight ahead, never blinking
'    ( ) There's a  standing in the distance
But it looks too small to be Jason
We   , The figure is a dripping wet boy with a sinister smile
-     () as the front of the squad car     - ,
as the front passenger door is shoved open by Sean, who drags out Rennie
McCulloch follows close behind, helping Sean carry her away from the wreckage, over by a row of old oil drums filled with slime and rainwater
Then it suddenly hits Sean
Miss Van Deusen
He takes two steps back to the car when: () The squad car interior is
opens her dazed eyes, seeing Miss Van Deusen's body charring inside the wreckage
It's incomprehensible
She numbly gets to her feet, stepping towards it
Something makes her hesitate: she peers down at the asphalt
- '    ( ) pool of gasoline has collected, flames dancing across its glassy surface
Suddenly a    , not unlike the lifeboat she was so afraid of
The rowboat glides across the surface of the burning gasoline,
The flames and asphalt '  -   - Shimmering water, clouds and pine trees reflected in it
The rowboat floats into view
The two occupants are and
She's wearing a bathing suit and an innocent smile
And not an inkling of fear about the water
She stands, letting the sun soak into her
What a beautiful day
Perfect for a swim, isn't it
She frowns at him, looking away
You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how
'll take some lessons this time promise
She bends over, splashing the water
That's what you said last year think the time for your first swimming lesson has just come
The splashing stops
You don't want to end up drowning like that Voorhees boy, do you
She's instantly tense
He never learned how either and he's still at the bottom of this lake
He is not
Oh, he is indeed
And ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't swim
You're telling a lie
Am
Let's find out
And quicker than she's able to react to it, as Rennie's body violently disrupts the calm surface
She immediately begins to flounder
McCulloch calmly leans over the edge
Better swim before Jason drags you down, Rennie
Come on, you can do it
but Rennie thrashes in the water, struggling to keep from sinking under the surface
' Her uncle's face blurs and clears as water splashes her eyes
can't
You can and you will
Swim, Rennie
is too panicked to obey
Hhhhelp
me
She coughs on some water then disappears
() The world above her ceases to exist, murky lake water taking over
Rennie looks-down, and to her horror
'    () Young Jason is grabbing her ankle and dragging her down
The whole image    and we: : - as the gasoline continues to burn, the rowboat gone
to find ' , the flames of the car wreckage flickering over her glassy eyes
She looks up at Miss Van Deusen's body one last time before: -   () The auto's fuel tank , #4 - She looks up at her uncle with knowing eyes
Eyes that tell him she's remembered everything
You pushed me
(defensively) was only trying to teach you
But pulled you out, Rennie
saved your life
Rennie just stares, incredulous
You son of a bitch
She lets it build until she's ready to explode
then: He was down there
And Rennie runs off
McCulloch starts to follow but Sean grabs him, shoving him down
You keep away from her
Sean chases after Rennie
Camera methodically , crumpled on the ground
very bitter man
He wipes his hands, getting ready to stand when His skin fades to porcelain white
You
are
But possible, and actual, he is ,
as the walking corpse lifts a screaming McCulloch over his head, carrying him over to one of the scum-filled ,   -
Jason grips McCulloch's thrashing legs as bubbles rise to the surface of the slime, a pathetic gurgling reverberating out the drum
At last McCulloch's appendages go limp
Jason releases him, moving on
#5 - as Sean runs into view, glancing around, spotting Rennie, crouched against a crumbled brick wall
No tears
only hate
Sean sits down next to her
After several moments
was at school when they told me
'Rennie, we have some very bad news
your parents have been killed in an auto accident
' Sean gently takes her hand, sharing her internal agony
It seems like everybody  care about ends up
She can't finish
as Sean kisses her on the forehead, then makes her look into his eyes
Not this time
He caresses her face; it develops into a tender kiss
Finally she holds him back, letting it out
At the same time: Somebody is creeping at a low angle towards them
are lost in their shared quiet moment
until the becomes audible
They look up, seeing: cautiously approaching them
Rennie stands, absolutely relieved
Toby
She starts to move towards him and her dog ,
What's wrong, boy
Another protective growl, then: as Jason stampedes through a stack of crates and garbage cans behind them
, abruptly flee down the alley, Jason in mad pursuit
/  - as Rennie, Sean and the dog run straight towards us, Jason swiftly catching up
over to a deserted, rain-slicked
-  () as they bang through the glass doors, sailing past us
Three beats later,  , not bothering to open the door,
-  (
) Sean, Rennie and Toby sail down the escalators past a few scattered
Again, Jason appears, looming tall at the top
He starts down the "up" escalator
'    (
) as an   rises toward us
Their reactions grow more bleak the closer we get, finally registering terror as we plow right through them
-   (
) Sean and Rennie hop over a metal turnstile, Toby crawling under it
leans out his window, shouting at them
Hey
The teenagers are soon forgotten as , The Ticket Taker reacts speechlessly, deciding not to press his luck
-  (
) as Sean and Rennie slide up to the edge of the track pit, which is taking too long to get there
Come on
but Jason arrives before the train
Toby barks and snarls, trying to protect them
Jason is unfazed
He treads toward them and: leaps onto Jason, sinking his teeth into the monster's throat
Jason wrestles the animal into submission just as: streaks into the station
fraction of time later: heaves the dog in front of the train
shrieks in horror as Toby disappears inside the pit just as the train roars by
- They're New Yorkers, but not callous enough to stomach this, quickly scattering
Even a group of severe decide they can wait for the next train, quickly heading up the escalators after seeing Jason in action
makes Rennie look away, dragging her with him along the platform edge in retreat as Jason returns his attention to them
They reach the end of the platform, having no choice but to board the front car
(
) as the doors whoosh shut
but Jason
The glances back from his booth, seeing Jason making the improper entry
Hey pal, you can't do that
second later he's gotten a good look at Jason
It's too late for a retraction as - as the Engineer's arm
-  (
) and the train begins to move, racing into the black tunnel
-  (
) as Rennie and Sean run for their lives, arriving at the end of a car, jamming the separating doors open and entering the next car
Jason follows right behind
-  (
) as the train thunders through the station without stopping, baffling several waiting
- '    (
) --seeing Sean and Rennie disappear through another connecting door
We storm our way through it into the next car right after them
handful of  cower away from us
-  (
) as the train rapidly speeds past us, showing no signs of slowing down
-   (
) as Sean and Rennie come through another set of separating doors, rushing through
finding they're in the last car
They look back, seeing Jason enter at the opposite end
The monster stalks forward
Sean's eyes dart around
He spots the -  (
) and the train
-  (
) The sudden stop throws Jason on his back
Sean throws the rear door open, jumping out with Rennie
-  (
) as Sean and Rennie sprint down the center of the tracks toward the light of the next station, running out of strength
-  (
) as they emerge from the darkness, up to the edge of the pit
Sean boosts Rennie up, starting to climb up himself when: fires out from the tunnel, grabbing onto Sean's ankle
Rennie screams as Sean is dragged down
but he manages to latch onto a chain securing a garbage receptacle
Jason pulls harder, stretching Sean to his limit as Rennie watches helplessly
runs straight towards the track pit like a football punter,     , () trips backwards and    ,  , His body smokes and convulses, finally sizzling out
He appears to be terminated
- as they get to their feet, holding each other tight, looking down on the now-dead undead creature
-  (
) ( ) as our heroes arise into the neon-filled big city wonderland, relieved to be alive, gazing around at the awesome spectacle known as Times Square
huge tells us it's a quarter to midnight
Sean wraps his arm around her
It's over, Rennie
It's finally over
Camera   ,
Guess who has just made an encore
with more energy than ever
look all around them, having never been to a city as big as this
They finally turn far enough around to spot in a series of three quick cuts, each one closer than the last
God
please no
But Jason keeps on coming
Somebody help us
He's going to kill us
But the heavy Times Square foot traffic ignores her, bustling onward
Rennie and Sean have no choice but to flee again
shoves his way through the preoccupied pedestrians; they've certainly seen weirder characters than him here
He moves past a group of   listening to some rap from their ghetto blaster
His foot obliterates their stereo system with one stride
They instantly pull out switchblades and chains
You're dead meat, slime bag
Jason stops, turning around, towering over the kids
He has blood and gore caked everywhere, his skin charred from the electrocution
Jason starts to remove his mask, facing them squarely
as Jason's mask comes off out-of-frame
Their tough faces turn to putty, scared completely shitless
Hey man, it's cool, it's cool
They turn tail and race like the wind
Jason steps forward so that we're looking at the back of his head, never seeing his naked face
He slips his hockey mask on again, turns into a  , then exits
- filled with noise, smoke and derelicts
tough, redheaded  with a thick Brooklyn accent stands behind the countertop, a wall of mirrors behind her
The front door bangs open with the entrance of Sean and Rennie, rushing up to the waitress
(out of breath) You have to call the police
Please, hurry
telephone sits right next to her, but this is New York
There's a pay phone in back
They start to run
but it's broken
You don't understand -- there's a maniac trying to kill us
(blase) Welcome to New York
There's no time for further response as , Sean and Rennie run out the back as the Waitress eyes Jason with complete disbelief
as the   comes out to confront him
Jason picks up the telephone, really pissed off
climbs off his counter stool, revealing a Jason plows straight for him and the Biker Jason has little reaction, pulling it out, tossing it aside
The Biker's face goes wan, backing away
stops in mid-dial
Fear is starting to register now
lifts the very large man and feels the phone receiver slipping from her grasp, her mouth trembling
She backs away from the beast as far as she can
Jason has no time to waste on her, trampling out the back after Rennie and Sean as the other patrons shrink from him
- as Sean fumbles to unlock three deadbolts and two chains, finally getting the back door open and springing into: - They run about ten yards before realizing the alley is a dead end
Sean and Rennie start to head back the other way when
Their vision scatters everywhere in search of a retreat
Look
She's spotted a  , slightly ajar
They haven't the luxury of thinking about it, Sean sliding the cover back as Jason comes forth
-   - as they descend into hell
a massive chamber consisting of tall columns, slimy catacombs and three feet of stagnant water
Their alternatives are nil; Sean and Rennie join hands, wading through the swill, splashing deeper into the labyrinth
as the dim streetlight glowing in the above world is eclipsed by , making his way down after them
#1 - An oval tunnel slanted downward into pitch blackness
Dim overhead lights illuminate salt deposits and eery rust formations
Rennie and Sean appear at the far end, wading from the sewage as the tunnel rises toward us
as they come forward at a brisk but cautious pace, strangers in a very strange land
- sloshing through the slime
All is silent until Sean's foot     labeled
vaporous green substance oozes out the rusty end of the container, sizzling on the around
carefully sidestep it, continuing on
They make it another ten yards when       , Rennie's scream echoes through the tunnel
but it's a middle-aged   who lowers the wrench, as frightened as they are
What the hell are you kids doing down here
Can you help us get out
sure can and we don't have a minute to waste
He begins quickly packing up his tools
What do you mean
Toxic waste, son
This sewer floods out with the stuff on the 13th of every month, right at midnight
(checks watch) And that's less than ten minutes from now
Rennie looks down the dark tunnels in all directions, swallowing hard
Follow me
He clicks on his high powered flashlight and quickly leads them down: #2 no less threatening than the one they just left
When they pass a lightless intersecting corridor, , rolls through the muck, its beam splashing erratically across the polluted walls
begins  '      but the monster drags the kicking and screaming man into #3
tries to help up Sean but he's been knocked into the opposite wall, barely conscious
Run, Rennie
She's struck with indecisive shock, looking into Tunnel #3, seeing: Jason arches his back with wrench in hand, hammering it over and over into the Sanitation Engineer's skull
backs away but does not run
The time has come to face her fears
-    #3 as Jason takes one more vengeful stroke, finishing him off
He steps from Tunnel #3 with the scarlet-coated tool, his shadow becoming flesh
He moves straight for Sean, who has no hope for escape
Jason cocks the wrench over Sean's skull
and suddenly his hockey mask is Jason stops, turning directly into it
' Rennie is blinding us with the sanitation Engineer's flashlight, giving us only brief glimpses of herself in the reflective wet surroundings
You never got me in the lake, Jason
And you're not going to get me now either
Her voice is defiant
She carefully backstops, the irritating light never leaving us
has been sufficiently taunted
He moves after her
' as the bright beam leaves our eyes, Rennie dashing down the intersecting tunnel (#1)
' stomping through the sludge, picking up speed
He's wanted to kill Rennie most of all
# as Rennie dashes up to the    Sean tripped over, using the back end of the flashlight to crush in the can's rusted lid
The metal is flimsy but still resists her blows
She frantically hammers harder
#2 - He's moving like a freight train now, an addict rolling after his fix
- as the butt of the flashlight dents the metal, ultimately causing it to cave in
- ' --Looking through his unblinking eyes, whipping into Tunnel #1
where we catch a fleeting glimpse of Rennie flinging the contents of the oil drum
half second later a   /
( ) and his hockey mask is    , '
He careens back as if her were a rabid dog receiving a load of point-blank buckshot
drops the can, fumbling for the flashlight again
-  () as the radiant flashlight beam finds his mask, the plastic beginning to bubble and melt , : rotted flesh, some of it sizzling from the chemical
Worms slithering out his nostrils
And his eyes
or lack thereof
They're like two raw quail eggs frying in liquid green pollutant
and the yolks just broke, running down his face
as the beam begins to waver in her quivering grasp ' , reacting to the stomach-turning sight of Jason's visage
She grabs hold of her senses and as Rennie skirts past the blinded creature: as she turns down Tunnel #2, heading back toward Sean
until we've come around 360 degrees and are back on , in no way ready to give up
He staggers after Rennie
#2 as Rennie skids up to Sean, still dazed
She grabs him, shaking hard
Get up, Sean
His eyes blink, only half coherent
Then an inconceivable terror registers in her ears
, ,
Her head jerks in the direction of her planned retreat: ' An ominously empty tunnel, soon to be filled with the unthinkable
The sound of   is growing at leaps and bounds
as her trembling chin rises, looking at: -  #3  () The dim overhead lights are beginning to vibrate from the approaching flood
rotates her head and sees: vision or no vision, he is lurching towards her relentlessly
She is literally sandwiched between hell and high water
drags Sean to his feet with the strength of a possessed woman, pulling him over to a   attached to the intersecting alcove wall
(screaming) Climb
She shoves him up it from below, Sean summoning everything he's got to obey her
Rennie shoots a stare back down the tunnel
'    () The overhead lights are banging around like an earthquake has just hit; the liquid will be arriving any second
Her vision   180 , groping around with his scaly arms like the claws of a roto-tiller
- as Rennie starts up after Sean, looking down and seeing: within ten feet of them, shifting directly for the ladder like he's working on some kind of radar
slips on the rusty ladder, regaining her footing
and rushing higher
She takes her final glance into the tunnel, the ultimate horror registering in her corneas as she sees: #3 ( ) million gallons of green-brown toxic waste splash into the far intersection,   , has just started to climb the ladder when the wind and smell of the rushing toxic waste bombards him
His decomposed head swivels to face: #3 ( ) Tons of lethal sewage, stopping for no one
Arriving in seconds
'    (/  ) He doesn't need vision to confirm what his other senses already know
Jason's mouth begins to quaver , : Mmmmmmmmmommy
'   , Camera speeds toward his gaping mouth and as lightning arcs off his mucous covered insides
We sink deeper into his guts, fire and smoke flaring into our eves, eventually coming to a ,
and Hhhhelp me
split second later: #3 () ( ) The wall of deadly toxic liquid
#3 -     () The powerful flood thrashes the ladder about two inches below Rennie's feet, the force of it fiercely shaking their rusty support
They are clinging to the ladder with their eyes squeezed shut
Praying for survival
#3 ( ) We are drowning in a chunky cloud of sewage, rushing over and under us
-  () The digital clock we saw earlier abruptly , -    () as the sewage level begins to drop
Rennie opens her eyes, glancing straight down and seeing
'    () The ladder beneath them reappears
which gives way to a The liquid drops further, unshrouding the now-dead corpse of He's a relatively normal looking boy, probably the way he looked back in 1957
right when he drowned in Crystal Lake
Jason Voorhees has finally been put to rest
-  (
) Rennie and Sean stagger out from a side street, holding each other up
relief etched in their matured faces
hear there's a statue here that's 22 stories tall
Rennie would smile if she could
She kisses his cheek
They amble on
coming out from another alley, creeping up behind them through a crowd of pedestrians
About the height of a small child
walk arm in arm, exhausted and oblivious to their pursuer
But something, some innate perception causes Rennie to slow
and stop
Her eyes register a horrid fear and she
Limping on all fours, filthy with grease-matted fur
The whimpering dog crawls up to her, Rennie bending down, hugging her animal like she'll never let go
Oh Toby
(
) as Sean bends down too, ruffling the dog's fur, standing again with Rennie
The three survivors enter the collage of pedestrians, bright lights and skyscrapers
It is finally over
