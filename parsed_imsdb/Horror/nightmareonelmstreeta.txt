Then we  a ' , dirty and nail-bitten, reach   and pick up a piece of

Their blades are thin, curved, gleaming sharp

We never will

as  , a strong girl of fifteen in a thin night shift, moves towards us down a dark concrete corridor
Her steps quicken as  appear in the portion of frame she leaves free
subliminal  of  threads in and out of the
Distant insane
Slamming iron
bleating animal , white and blank-faced, skitters across her path and on into the dark
No reason why it's there
Then another , much nearer -- the slithering  of something like fingernails across slate
It sets our teeth on edge, twists the , and sends  running

Suddenly 's a tiny figure running among huge boilers steam pipes and catwalks -- a shadowed forest of iron and stone
She stops, listening intently as the  of tiny hooves suddenly turns into the rattle of
Then she hears
Someone is shouldering behind a ragged screen of dirty canvas, approaching
The long curved fingerblades suddenly punch through, flashing in the firelight, and begin ripping through the thick fabric, as easily as scalpels through flesh
They make a hideous, extended
rushes away, hands over her ears
-- as the blinded girl stumbles backwards
Then the canvas flaps free
The blades are gone
The  , and everything goes silent
until 's looking right into our eyes
The light from a nearby boiler pours through her thin night dress, leaving her naked and vulnerable
Then a deep, ragged whispers at her as
(
) One two, Freddie's coming for you
opens her mouth to scream but only a dry, yellow dust pours out
And at that precise moment a huge shadowy  with a grimey red and yellow sweater and a weird hat pulled over his scarred face lunges at her
And it's his fingers that are tipped with the long blades of steel, glinting in the boney light and giving the hulk the look of an otherworldly predator
dodges away, her legs suddenly elephantine and slow
The seizes the trailing hem of her nightgown and hauls her back
The  shrieks as  manages to tear free -- the  lurches after her with a hoarse  as we -- : 4

Someone is  on her door
'  (
) You okay, Tina
'  sticks her head in with a worried look
sits up and blows out a breath, groggy
Just a dream, Ma
(more to herself) Damn dream, is all
The woman, once attractive, ventures a step into the room hovers
' mother waves him away without looking, shoving a strand of bleached hair from her eyes
She appraises her daughter
' Some dream, judging from that
She nods at 's nightshift
looks down at her nightgown, only now aware of the chill penetrating it from the room
There are four long slashes up its middle, cleanly cut as if by scalpels
() (distant, annoyed) You coming back to the sack or what
' Hold your horses
(lower, to Tina as she stands to leave) You gotta cut your nails or stop that kind of dreaming, Tina
One or the other
The woman shuts the door behind her
looks back to her nightgown
(low) Oh, shit
She suddenly snatches up the cross that hangs over her head, her face white as her sheet

this large highschool and its crowds of ,  climbs out of a cherry-red 1959 Cadillac convertible with two other students, best friend , and Nancy's boyfriend and owner of the car,
several  are playing jump-rope, and the old ditty they sing continues unbroken from 's bedroom
Seven eight, gonna stay up late
Nine ten -- never sleep again

She's a pretty girl in a letter      7
sweater, with an easy, athletic stride and the look of a natural leader
, holding her hand, wears one of the school's football jerseys; a good-natured, bright kid
Tina's in mid-conversation
(referring to kids' song) That's what it reminded me of -- that old jump rope song
(shudders) Worst nightmare  ever had
You wouldn't believe it
Nancy nods
Matter of fact  had a bad dream last night myself
turns to , but before either can say more,  , a lean, Richard Gere sort in black leather and New Wave studs joins up with them and interupts
(to Tina) Had a hardon this morning when woke up, Tina
Had your name written all over it
Tina cracks her gum with a look of withering indifference
There's four letters in my name, Rod
How could there be room on your joint for four letters
The guy's stopped in his tracks
Hey, up yours with a twirling lawn mower
He cuts off across the lawn
Rod says the sweetest things
He's nuts about you
Yeah, nuts
makes a face and rakes her fingernails across a tree as she passes
() (yawns) Anyway, 'm too tired to worry about the creep
Couldn't get back to sleep at all
(beat) So what you dream
Forget it, the point is, every body has nightmares once in a while
No biggy
Next time you have one, just tell yourself that's just all it is, right while you're having it, y'know
That's the trick
Once you do that, you wake right up
At least it works for me
looks at  sharply
He kisses  and darts off for class
Hey
You have a nightmare too
But 's gone

Nancy and  are watching, giggling
can't believe his mother let him come over here
Right
Well, she didn't, exactly
shoves a cassette into 's Ghetto Blaster
(to ) See,  got this cousin who lives near the airport, that it's okay for me to stay with, right
So found this sound effects tape at Licorice Pizza, and
The phone is answered
jerks the tone arm off the record with a
() Hello, Mom
(pushes the 'play' button) Yeah, out here at Barry's
begins to make itself heard on the tape
moves the machine closer to the phone
It's a big plane -- sounds like a 747 coming in for a landing
() Huh
Yeah, noisy as usual
Glad we don't live here -- huh
Yeah, Aunt Eunice says hello
The Jet is   now, full flaps and howling like a monstrous banshee
and  dissolve into muffled giggles
() (shouting over the din) Right, right -- 'll call you in the morning
Right
Huh
Yeah, sure, , huh
Suddenly the tape goes silent
blanches
Next moment another  is heard, but this one is a   screaming by at 180 mph
() (reacting to his mother's reaction) Uh
some kid's drag racing outside,  think
The sound effect changes abruptly to a   -- and the ages-old  of , last-second  and horrible gamely tries to find the right button to turn it off, but misses
There's a loud  of fast-forward mayhem -- Glen improvises desperately
() Listen, Mom,  got to go -- think there's been an accident out front --  -- jumps back from the cassette player --    bursts out at top volume --  ,  , and  of charging Huns
makes a last-ditch dive and flings the cassette out of the machine
Blessed silence at last
() Right
'll call the police
No, just some neighbors having a fight, guess
'm fine, 'm fine
Call you in the morning
He hangs up and sags back
Worked like a charm

We see poking at a flame in the hearth as  comes  to draw the drapes
Nice to have a fire
Really

turns a nearby valve handle, and the gas fire climbs brightly over its artificial log
joins her, heartened
Maybe we should call Rod, have him come over too
He might get jealous
Rod and  are done
He's too much of a maniac
He should join the Marines, they could make something out of him
Like a hand grenade
laughs despite herself
brightens
See
You've forgotten the bad dream
Didn't  tell you
shakes her head, wishing she had forgotten
All day long  been seeing that guy's weird face, and hearing those fingernails
looks up with a flinch
Fingernails
(blinks, laughing) That's amazing, you saying that
It made me remember the dream had last night
looks up
What you dream
dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; dream in color, y'know; he walked into the room  was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me
Sort of obscenely
Then he walked out through the wall on the other side
Like he'd just come to check me out
The story has left the room deathly quiet
Especially  seems effected
(quietly) So what about the fingernails
remembers, imitating the frightful coincidence
He scraped his fingernails along things -- actually, they were more like fingerknives or something, like he'd made them himself
Anyway, they made this horrible nose -- (imitates) sssssccrrrtttt pales
Nancy
You dreamed about the same creep  did, Nancy
The girls stare at each other
That's impossible
They look at him
He looks away, as if suddenly listening
What
Nothing
There's somebody out there, isn't there
didn't hear anything
Then there's an unmistakeable
distinct  against the house, just outside the window
Something multiple, thin and sharp
Something like metal fingernails
's mouth opens a fraction of an inch

10
as a  , a  , a  is At last the door swings open and  swaggers out
'm gonna punch out your ugly lights, whoever you are
No answer but a slight  in the bushes
does a 180 and walks right back inside
The girls prod him right back out, giddy with giggling fear
It's just a stupid cat
Then bring us back its tail and whiskers
The girls push him farther
edges towards the shadows
Then the  again
stops;  edges back into the house
Anyway,  don't have a cat
Turned from the girls,  sobers, listening
we see the street
Silent houses
Motionless trees on empty lawns
Kitty-kitty
Chow chow chow
Not a living, or dead, soul
turns back to the girls with a shrug
Instantly, a large  pounces and throws him to the ground with a shout
The girls  in panic and run for the house
11
--  leaps up and shouts like a sportscaster --          11
And it's number thirty-six, Rod Lane, bringing Lantz down just three yards from the goal with a brilliant tackle
And the fans go wild
dances into the light, flashing a wild gypsy's grin at
The girl's relieved and frightened at the same time
What the hell you doing here
Came to make up, no big deal
Your ma home
Of course
What's that
takes the spindly hand rake he's found and scraps the house's wall
It makes a terrible
He grins and tosses it aside
Intense, huh
(sizes up the three) So what's happening, an orgy or something
Maybe a funeral, you dickhead
wheels, a knife suddenly in his hand, as if ready to take Glen's throat out
breaks between -- -- Just a sleep-over date, Rod
Just Tina and me
Glen was just leaving
eyes , laughs and flips the knife closed and away, putting his arm around 's shoulder and laughing as if it's all a great joke
You see his face
(lower) Your ma ain't home, is she
(to Nancy & Glen) Me and Tina got stuff to discuss
He pulls  inside without further ceremony
Rod
But 's already got himself and  halfway through the living room, heading into the darker part of the house
We got her mother's bed
You two got the rest
We should get her out of here
darts to the front door, her blouse half out
Hey -- you guys're hanging around -- right
(fake laughing/whine) Don't leave me alone with this lunatic -- Pleeeeze,
She disappears
looks at
Too innocent
So we'll guard her together
Through the night
(moving closer) In each others' arms like we always said
Glen
Not now
mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves
She kisses him lightly, then pushes him back
(frustrated) Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway
Because he was scary, that's why
Who was scary
turns and looks at him
Don't you think it's weird, her and me dreaming about the same guy
( looks away; stares closer) You didn't have a bad dream last night, did you
gives her a funny look
Me
don't dream
He takes her inside

It's just past 2
the cold hearth and darkened living room to   on the couch, cacooned in sheets
He's listening miserably to the coming from the next room
peaks, howls
Then silence
Morality sucks

This is a slightly larger room than 's
Adult
Female
Spare in its appointments
The streetlight throws the narrow bed into broken shadow and light
lie in each other's arms in the middle of the big bed
Satiated
knew there was sometihng about you  liked
yawns into the pillows, happy
You feel better now, right
Jungle man fix Jane
No more fights
No more fights
(sleepily) Good
No more nightmares for either of us then
He pulls the covers over his head
He's almost out already
(beat) When did you have a nightmare
(under the blankets) Guys can have nightmares too, y'know
You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something
He rolls over, practically snoring, and pulls another cover over his head
dirty red and yellow cover
(sleepily) Where'd you get this snotty old thing
from
yawns, turns off the light and snuggles against , pulling the cover gingerly over herself, too

across the room of the original nightmare to find alone in 's bed, staring at the slanting ceiling above the bed
Thinking
We can just hear her  beating
She sighs and turns on her side
Immediately the wall above her head turns a faint reddish hue, with a broad yellow smear across its center
All unseen by , the wall begins to pulse in exact time with her heart's beat
'
She closes her eyes
presses against the surface from the inside
The plaster buldges out as if suddenly elastic, taking the shape of the thing pressing from inside -- taking the shape of a man's face The face opens its mouth
The knives rake through the surface
-- as plaster dust snows down on her
She jerks awake, sitting bolt upright
The face retracts suddenly -- the wall is normal
as she looks up to the ceiling, touching her hair and feeling the plaster dust
There are three parallel cuts in the plaster there
About eight inches long
As if cut by sharp knives
Nothing else
Back on
She draws the covers around her and shivers
Eyes wide open

Not a car or person in sight
stricken breeze dies in the trees
17
on the window of the room where  sleeps
By the time  17
we're    on it, the air is again still as death moment later a  bounces off the pane
The appears in the lower registers and holds its breath
Another  strikes, with a sharper

The   ; the trees brush the window with their shadows
Then another pebble slips to the window

'
21
She looks out on an old yard with a patch of bananna trees rattling in the Santa Ana winds
It seems deserted, though the welling dark won't let her be sure
Then another pebble --
-- hitting with a sharp
22
as  jumps back, startled
She hadn't    22
seen that one coming
But she's drawn back to the glass out of curiousity, straining to see in the dark
It's as if the stones are materializing out of thin air
23
' '
23
This time a heavier stone, and a thin crack bristles across the glass
(low) Who the fuck you think you are, whoever you are
24
'
24
appears in the doorway
(listening) Somebody there
She can see through the backward to a yawning gate and the back alley
No one there
But a word is spoken, as if by wind
(garbled) Tina
straightens, unable to swallow
There's a ragged, obscene Deep in the throat
Phlegmy
Who the hell is that
charges across the yard and through the gate, the chasing after
25
25
She brakes in the middle of the alley and whirls around
Listening
Shivering in the same thin slashed nightgown
sharp crank of , and fifty feet down the alley the lid of an ash can rolls from the dark like a huge tin coin and spirals noisily down
26
Despite herself she comes over    26
and touches it
She comes up with long worms on her fingers
Next moment the exact same shambling  from her nightmare staggers into view fifty feet behind her
falls back into the shadows, shaking the worms off her fingers in repulsion
The turns and starts directly for her, something shining on his right hand as he spreads his arms wide
He starts scraping the steel  along a cinderblock wall
Orange sparks spurt out -- his arms elongate until they reach from one side of the alley to the other -- and  is cut off from her home
as the  of the blades gets louder and closer
She begins to shake uncontrollably
Oh, shit, please God
(softly, approaching) This is God
He holds up his steel-tipped hand like a surgical-steel spider
runs for her life
27
-- a terrifying, all-out footrace         27
between the girl and her pursuer
The  is fast; the distance between them closes with each heartbeat
overturns ashcans -- claws her way through a rotten back fence, hammers against a window
Ashen  appear, recoil, pull curtains closed and disappear in fright

'

runs out onto front lawns,  for help
No help comes
In fact, the only response is for all the porch lights on the block to be turned off
The  roars out from behind a tree -- a tree too narrow to have hidden him -- nearly upon the girl
runs in panic -- at last making her own home, only to be trapped against its locked front door
She hammers against its thick wood
Nancy
Open the door -- Nancy
The  slows
He has  now and knows it
She's still awake
Nancy can't hear you
turns and looks full at the approaching
Smudged by deep shadow, he's big and hideous
He wears the same dirty yellow sweater from the first nightmare -- from the wall-hanging and blanket too -- and has the same sagging hat and leering grin over his misshapen face
And on his fingers are the steel talons
29
as he takes the blade on the end of his right index   29
finger and lopes off one of the fingers of his left hand
Then another
We  the    fall past ' face in of the  squirming on the ground, one flopping onto 's naked foot
leaps back, sickened, and begins stamping on then as if they were huge bugs
The  snaps up his arm and the  fly back into place on his hand
He leers at  -- then suddenly lunges at her, sweeping with his cutting hand
's no weak sister -- blocks his arm, deflecting the spines, and grabs the 's ugly face with her other hand
But the face only slides off to the bone The  presses in, and contorts in horror as the knives slash across her shoulder -- cutting her deeply
29A
staggers backward, , her foot now inexplicably        29A
caught in bedclothes
She falls over her bed's conformter, twists away from the man and, like a child, pulls the cover over her
The skull-faced  crushes down, and there's a fierce grappling -- punctuated by his  and the girl's   -- and they both become totally wrapped in the comforter -- until they're beneath it, fighting for life and death

'

lurches up into   in the lightless bedroom, half-awakened by the tremendous struggle somewhere, somehow inside the dark bed
grabs groggily, lifting the blanket
30A
we glimpse the dark underside of the blanket -- see     30A
flailing and clawing under the bedspread -- and the  -- or a shape that could be a man -- raging against each other
drops the blanket and leaps from the bed, scared full awake and terrified
Then the horrible 's  change to the of a terribly wounded victim
instantly jerks back the bedspread
we   struggling and flailing along on the sheets, the  nowhere in sight
-tina
Suddenly  -- eyes turned inward to her tormentor -- give an awful jolt -- her arms and legs are spraddled as if by overwhelming force and pinned to the bed
Next instant, her nightgown flies apart and four long gashes chase across her torso
From no visible instruments
huge irrigation of blood floods the bed
Terrified,  dives for the light -- but at the same moment something invisible grabs , wielding her body in the air and bringing it around in a swift blow that knocks  crashing into the light -- smashing it to bits
31
as he struggles around
In the blue        31
sees  sliding up the bedroom wall in a dark smear, dragged feet first -- paralized by terror
'   -- moving with her up the wall and bumping around the corner onto the ceiling
She's just looking at who's dragging her, eyes glazing
-- to the shadowy, horrendously ugly , dragging her with fierce glee across the ceiling, literally swabbing the ceiling with her bloody body
in , the  carries her across a great distance without seeming to get anywhere -- as if the ceiling is an endless plane
-- on his hands and knees -- the lamp next to him blurting blue  and  the nightmare room
' screaming up at ' invisible tormentor
What the hell's going  here
Tina
-- upside down, clawing at the hanging swag lamp above her mother's dressing table -- desperate for some anchor
But she's dragged away from it
The lamp swings back, it's wires gushing more
along the ceiling as  rakes a long furrow in the ceiling with her fingernails
But her eyes are glazing, glazing
And then they fall closed
,    , as her body suddenly flops loose, hanging for an awful moment by the feet over the bed
-- staring like a terrified child
Tina -- -- as the body falls like a sack of rocks onto the devastated bed, in  , striking with a huge splash of blood
sick, awful  floats around the room, then off into infinity
staggers up, staring around as if hoping to see this phantom
You motherfucker 'll kill you for that

32
is sitting straight up in bed, terrified
The  of are ringing through the whole house
She forces herself to move -- bolting from the bed despite her terror and sense of dread
33
33
flies into the dark hall -- crashing directly into who lurches out of the dark before her
She  and jumps back -- What the hell's going on
Oh -- jeez -- Glen
Rod's gone ape
() (sobbing) 'll kill you
grabs the door; it's locked; she pounds on it
Things fall into sudden, awful silence on the other side
's voice cracks with fear
Rod
(silence) Rod, you better not hurt Tina
erupts into terrible
Then they hear
barrels into the door like the football player he is
The frame splinters and they're in

Just inside the door  slips and goes down hard
finds her in the dark more by touch than sight
You okay
Yeah
Something slippering all over here
(feeling) Tina
No answer
The room is quiet as a tomb
Except for a stead , from all over
Then  finds a
On the  the devastation is revealed
There's everywhere: up the walls, over the clawed ceiling, soaking the killing floor of the bed, and pooling in the dark red puddle where  has slipped and fallen
Oh, shit
wobbles up and sees  in the center of the ravaged bed
Unmistakeably and utterly dead
presses against the wall, then contorts and chokes
() (numb) 'm gonna call the cops -- He bursts from the room

She turns away from the body in repulsion,        35
sticking her head through the shattered window   used for his escape, sucking in the cold night air and moaning

and  as an unmarked   speeds to the curb

His shaken aide, a uniformed patrolman named , greets him

Sorry to wake you, but -- 'd've canned your ass if you hadn't
What you got
stumbles to open the door for  as the man bulls into the station at a furious pace
Her name was Tina Gray
It was her home
Father abandoned ten years ago, mother's in Vegas with a boyfriend

Hi, dad

(hotter) But 'd sure would like to know what the hell you were doing shacked up with three other kids in the middle of the night -- especially a delinquent lunatic like Lane
weaves
Rod's not a lunatic
You got a sane explanation for what he did
The girl is shredding a Kleenex, staring off
Apparantly he was crazy jealous
Nancy said they'd had a fight, Rod and Tina
(quietly) It wasn't that serious
Maybe you don't think murder's serious -- sits bolt upright in her chair, her eyes flashing
She was my best friend
Don't you dare say  don't take her death seriously
(lower, near tears) just meant their fights weren't that serious
The girl holds the woman's eyes a moment, then looks away
() (to herself) She dreamed this would happen
What
She had a nightmare about somebody trying to kill her, last night
That's why we were there; she was afraid to sleep alone
tear splashes off the arm of her chair
She's been through enough for one night
You have her statement
The mother and daughter rise;  raps on the door and opens it
(to ) suggest you keep a little better track on her -- she's still a kid, y'know

The girl looks a little better than she did in the Police Station, but her eyes are still red-rimmed, and a vacant stress masks her face

She cocks her head, puzzled, as if sensing something

a newspaper, but really watching her

from the opposite direction, clamps over ' mouth and drags her into the bushes

struggles, twisting against the powerful assailant
-- barefoot, clad only in jeans and leather jacket, still caked with dark blood
The rest of his skin is pale as a ghost's
'm not gonna hurt you
He releases her warily
makes no move to run or scream, even though several  pass on the nearby sidewalk
This reassures  just a little
Your old man thinks  did it, don't he
He doesn't know you
(eyeing the blood) Couldn't you change
The cops were all over my house
(shivers) They'll kill me for sure
Nobody's gonna kill you
He runs his hands down his face, trying to believe that
The two study each other
never touched her
You were screaming like crazy
says this without accusation, just cool observation
Someone else was there
The door was locked from your side
grabs her hard
His muscular body tenses
Don't look at me like 'm some kind of fucking fruitcake or something, 'm warning you

) Morning, Mr
Lane

The boy jerks around

38 leveled right at    42

Now just step away from her, son
Like your ass depended on it

Then he dives out of the bushes and runs like hell
snaps his revolver to fire -- but instinctively jumps between -- No
jerks his gun into the air, furious
Jesus -- are you crazy
He plunges past the girl

races like a frightened animal across the lawns -- but is soon cut off by the   saw watching her before -- and then   , who close from another angle
The chase is short and pitifully off-balance, and  is soon wrestled to the ground

You used me, daddy

Hey
But she just keeps going

an   and ,  among the kids, trying to concentrate
According to Shakespeare, there was something operating in Nature, perhaps inside human nature itself, that was rotten -- a canker, as he put it
The ' eyes glance across the room
; yawning but listening
() Of course Hamlet's response to this, and to his mother's lies, was to continually probe and dig -- just like the gravediggers -- always trying to get beneath the surface
The same was true in a different way in Julius Caesar
Jon, go ahead
She nods to a  who's been waiting uncomfortably in front of the class
He squints at his book and begins, the recitation a struggle between baked and salted brain and the poetry of the Bard
(reading aloud) Uh, In the most high and palmy state of Rome
(
) California's the most high and palmy state, man
The  halts with a grin;  snicker
Can it
She glares them back into silence
The  starts over, as we She's nodding off now, barely able to keep her eyes open in the warm, close boredom of the classroom

) In the most high and palmy state of Rome, a little ere the mightiest Julius fell

weight
By the time her cheek's against the desk, the ' is  and
But another voice, ', is very near, very much present
sad, thin plaint
(
) Nancy
gives a start
Her eyes lock onto something
45
,   ' , we look straight     45
out through the open doorway of the classroom into the hall
There, standing in a black pool of fluid, is a full-sized rubber body bag
Dark red and yellow
Weaving slightly, the merest suggesting of movement within it
46
, sitting upright, wiping the sleep from her eyes,    46
shaking her head like a punchy prozefighter
She looks back out the door
47
''  -- the hallway is empty
But there's a    47
dark smear on its floor tiles
48
looks nervously towards the rest of the class
No one else  48
has noticed a thing outside the door
All are dumbly spellbound by the , who now recites like a deep-voiced robot, his face wreathed by white hair
God,  could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that  have bad dreams
49
She slips from her seat, eye warily on the   49
teacher and class
But no one turns as she disappears through the doorway

turns and looks both directions
No sign of anybody

) (distant) Nancy
wheels and sees the bag, prone on the tiles at the far end of the hall, at the end of a long snail's trail of slime
pale hand thrusts out of it
moment later, as if pulled by invisible gravity, the bag slides out of sight into an intersecting corridor
Tina
starts running for it
51
as  races blindly around the turn and     51
smashes straight into a  lunging at her from the opposite direction
Both go down

dazed freshman  cranks herself up  52
on one elbow
She wears a plastic plaque on her red and yellow sweater that reads 'Hall Guard'
Her nose is bleeding from the impact
-you're not supposed to run
-where's your pass -- you got a pass
leaps up -- Screw your stupid pass
53
She turns -- sees the body bag halfway down this darker, narrower  53
hall, upright again
But just as she sees it, it tips and pitches headlong through a doorway -- like some godawful rotten tree finally timbering down
She can hear the sickening of it falling down a long flight of stairs
runs for it again
The  staggers up , bleeding profusely from her eyes and ears
Hey, no running in the halls
The  raises her hand and we see it's tipped with long metal spikes
as  runs up
turns to check out the
She's vanished
turns and looks down through the open door
The  sweeps through a strange, brooding movement of strings, mounting towards the 54
54
edges into the stairwell and looks down
Looks like there's a fire somewhere down there, from the way the orange light dances
But there's only a low
Tina
No answer
starts down the stairs
55
55
comes off the stairs into a dank boiler room
The smear trail is there
It runs behind a cracking, red-hot boiler the size of a diesel locomotive
Everything about the place feels dreadfully wrong, and the  is deep into the when it pauses
Slow terror moves into her face
There's a low, sinister
56
-- we see a tangle of pipes, shadows, and the   56
tainted fire of the huge boiler
Then from behind this, deeply shadowed but still identifiable, steps 's
The same filthy red and yellow sweater and slouch hat, the same melted face twisting into a smile, the same   as he slides the long blades from beneath his shirt and fans them on the ends of his bony fingers
Who are you
Gonna get you
57
The leering  brings the bloodied scalpel-fingernails across     57
his own chest, splitting a nipple
Yellow fluid pours out
and
forgets the question -- jerks around and flees in blind panic into the first opening she sees -- a dark pipe tunnel
58
58
In the  the killer shambles towards her;   breaks into a run
The killer sprints --  tears ahead into darkness
She flees deeper and deeper into the labyrinth of steaming, pipes, squeezing through smaller and smaller openings
The killer is just yards behind her, and soon she's trapped, just as  was before her
She presses her back to the wet bricks
There's no hope of fighting him off, for  is not as strong as
But she is smart as hell, and thinking even in this nightmare
So by the time the creep has raised his knives to strike,  has realized something
She wheels and shoves her arm against one of the scalding steam pipes
In the sme split second we  her flesh scald, we : 59
59
lurches up , arm raised to ward off the invisible blow, books clattering to the floor -- other  nearby in surprise as she stumbles over them
Then she stops, confused and groggy from the nightmare
is staring at  as if she's gone mad
The   rushes over, herself frightened by the terror in the girl's eyes
Okay -- Okay, Thompson
Every- thing's all right now -- Nancy
60
jerks around with panicked eyes, expecting the killer to     60
leap from any direction
But there's only the sea of staring eyes
begins methodically picking up her books
'll call your mother
No
No, really, 'm fine
'll go straight home
'm okay
She marches for the door
You'll need a hall pass
But the girl's gone
61
61
walks out of the building, shaken
Then she pauses at one of the big pine trees out front, stops and rests her head against its bark, teeth set
starts to shake, and next second she's sobbing like a broken-hearted, frightened child
61A
61A
62
But she shakes herself silent
Wipes the tears away with a slash  62
of sleeve
She rubs her arm absently, lost in thought, then reacts in surprise and pain
She lifts her arm and stares at the spot she's touched
and the  there; about the size and shape of a half-dollar
Utterly, chillingly confused

Decide to take a day off after all
Dad,  want to see Rod Lane

Only family allowed, Nancy
You know the drill
Just want to talk to him a second
He's dangerous
You don't know he did it
No,  know, thanks to your own testimony, that he was locked in a room with a girl who went in alive and came out in a rubber bag

How could somebody get under the covers with you guys without you knowing it
How the fuck do  know

studies his encrypted eyes
Surprisingly, she looks like she just might believe him
She leans closer with a new thought
What he look like
You get a look at him
He looks away
No
Well then how can you say somebody else was there
Because somebody cut her
While watched
Now the place is so quiet you can hear heartbeats
Somebody cut her while you watched and you don't know what he looked like
smiles an insane smile, stuck with a reality no one will buy
You couldn't see the fucker
You could just see the cuts happening, all at once
gives a twitch
What you mean 'all at once'
(low) mean, it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time
But invisible razors
She just
opened up
By now he's picking at a clot of dark blood on his jacket, as if it was a scab on his own body
Then he catches  watching and turns away to the back of the cell
He smashes his fist into the wall -- bone-crushing blows that scare the wits out of Rod
He stops, and his fist is dripping blood as he says in a small, sad voice
probably could've saved her if 'd moved sooner
But thought it was just another nightmare, like the one  had the night before

67
The house is in shadow
Alone,  scrapes the last of the evening's dishes and slips them into the dishwasher
Neither she nor her daughter has touched the food
But  is well into a bottle of gin; her appetite for that is growing, right along with her dread
She turns and looks up the stairs, calling
Nancy, don't fall asleep in there
() won't
Get into bed

' in the tub, so drowsy she can hardly rinse without falling asleep
The water in the tub is opaque with suds
Luxurious
,
Her eyes droop
She slides closer to the surface of the water, letting its heat sooth her nerves
Her eyes stare straight up, glazed; her breathing deepens
, across to her legs, crooked, one knee on each side of the tub
There's a ripple in the water between
Then something tiny and shiny breaks the surface between them
It pops up with a slithering   and catches a sliver of light
Then it begins to rise
Higher and higher it rises, soon accompanied by another, then two more shining, gleaming blades, and then the full glove and dark hairy hand and then the wrist and arm, straight up light an evil sapling between the girl's knees, the knives bloosoming into a bright flower of razor sharp steel in the air, moving over the girl's belly
The hand rears back, the claws arch to strike
(/) Nancy
raps on the door
The instant she does  jerks up, opening her eyes groggily
The dark wet arm, hand and knifes are gone

You could drown, you know
Mother, for petesakes
() It happens all the time

Why don't you jump into bed
(fading) 'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too
'mon, now
(then she's gone into another room) (low) Warm milk
Gross
She slides down to water level again, and sings softly, thoughtfully to herself
() One, two, Freddie's coming for you, three four, better lock your door, five six, grab your crucifix, seven eight gonna stay up late, nine ten, never sleep again
The next instant she's jerked with incredible violence straight down beneath the surface of the tub -- as if the bottom had suddenly dropped out and she was in a bottomless well
68A
68A
we   pulled sharply down into really deep water, the dim light of the surface and bathroom beyond receding with each yank
And yet she somehow flails and gasps and struggles back towards the surface, managing by pure panic to break the surface with her hands

rushes to the door and listens, alarmed at the wild audible through the locked door
Nancy

'  reaches to the girl, who thrusts up through main force and breaks the surface with her head and shoulders

Gasping and choking,  breaks the surface of her bathwater, like a drowning sailer getting one last chance
Her mother's booms over her,  and frantic -- and the loud on the door finally opens her eyes
She turns and calls gasping to her mother -- Mommy
-- as , using the old hangar through the doorhandle truck, makes it into the room
She rushes across to the tub
is staggering up in the bathwater, again with solid porcelain beneath her feet
told you
Hundreds of people a year drown like that
The mother throws a towel around the gasping girl, helps her from the tub and begins drying her like a child
looks like she's likes paralized with some sort of weird dread
You okay
Great (not believing it for a minute) To bed with you, c'mon
rushes out to get the room ready
turns and looks at herself in the cabinet mirror, then opens the medicine chest and begins a quick, furtive search
as she takes out the box of No Doz and slips it into her robe

Sorry
Saw your light on

There's no maliciousness in his voice, and the familiar frankness is actually comforting to

looks her over
You look dead and rained on, if you want the ugly truth
And what you do to your arm
She shrugs, trying to keep it casual
Burned myself in Englsh class
She hazards a look in the mirror, and her jaw drops
'god,  look twenty years old

Slept like a rock

We  with her
But nothing, not even the dog barking earlier, is there now
peers into the darkness of lawns and trees behind her
(stage whisper) You still there
Across the street and a distance away,  steps from behind a tree
Yeah
So
Just checking -- keep out of sight
throws up his hands in exasperation and walks back out of sight
turns and looks down between the houses, deep into a dark alleyway
Then she forces herself to walk into it
79
79
as she makes herself go deeper and deeper into shadows
Each time she pauses and waits, the  grows more threatening and expectant
The feeling is of immense tension -- we're sure the killer will come screaming out on her at any second
But he doesn't
In fact absolutely nothing happens, and emerges from the far end of the alley unscathed
The only thing strange is that she now finds her self looking across the mall to 80
80
The Police Station
It takes her a little by surprise, it just seems to have appeared
creeps into the   as  whispers hoarsely back down the dark alley

It's a low, barred basement window, and  reacts as soon as she looks through it

The boy is on his rough cot, twitching in disturbed sleep
And a long  is sliding across the wall

The from all of their nightmares
And this giant shadow of a man passes through the bars of the cell, like so much evil Jello
Halfway through he pauses, turning to check over his shoulder
We see the bars clearly penetrating his body, going in his head, passing out his ankles
Then he turns back to  and moves forward, and within another heartbeat is beside the boy

Without thinking,  bangs against the glass

Look out
The  wheels around, locking eyes with
The girl goes white
The man's face is in the light, and it's horrible -- seething with hatred and a twisted, insane intelligence
The hold of those eyes is only broken when  rolls up on an elbow with a deep, troubled
The instant  does this, the  fades into the shadows in the cell
But even then his eyes hold on 's until the last second he's visible
looks around the cell groggily, runs his fingers through his matted hair, then collapses back on his pillow
No matter how hard  screams,  never once looks at the window
He just pulls the twisted covers about his shoulders and succumbs once more to sleep

Suddenly  feels utterly exposed

She can't move
It's as if some great nerve between her instincts and body had been severed
And she hears the  behind her
sort of filling-vibrating Scrriiitchh sneaks in -- the unmistakeable  , creeping over her
forces herself, by sheer will, to look
90
Ahead of her perhaps twenty-five feet, covered with a thick        90
plastic body bag through which we can barely see her face, is Standing square in the middle of the street
dark ooze of   roil out of its bottom, and at its top, the zipper down and the greenish-white face of  lolls out
She gestures, supplicating, her watery eyes desperate to convey some desperate message

The girl intinctively pitches back, then scrambles up and runs like hell

Glen

at full gallop, running blind
She crashes through a sawhorse into a new sidewalk, sinking into the wet cement over her ankles
The stuff sticks to her legs in long gluey globs and she can barely pull her feet loose
The  looms nearby, mocking her -- his scalpel claws gleaming in the streetlight
He just misses the girl as she wrenches free and flees again, now so winded she can only stagger
Time after time  just barely manages to elude the shadowy form, leaping from his reach by inches and pouring on more steam
It's too close to even bother screaming now; and besides, that would take breath she doesn't have

Safe at last
She listens at the door
Nothing
She crosses to her bed
Next second the  dives through her window and seizes her in a shower of shattered glass twists and manages to grab the wrist of his knife hand with both of hers, barely keeping the blades from her throat
The two fall backwards in a terrible, gasping struggle, crashing onto 's bed
Her grip is broken -- the  stabs -- twists away, backed into a corner of bed and walls
Defenseless, she snatches a pillow up; the  lashes out -- disemboweling the pilow and sending a great gush of feathers flying dives for escape in a virtual blizzard
The  manages to snare her with his other hand, and the two crash across the bedside table to the floor, the table and all its contents cascading around them in a whiteout of feathers
--   '   '
The blades inch towards the girl's face -- the drool of the grizzled shadow with the horribly scarrred face spills into her eyes
Feathers are everywhere;  is absolutely insane
But just when the points of steel are less than an inch from her eyes, the old fashioned alarm clock thrown to the floor next to 's head goes off with a jarring

Wary and furious, her voice hoarse
Glen, you bastard
The boy looks at his friend in groggy alarm
She's absolutely livid, more angry than he's ever seen her, and more strange
What  do
He reaches for her -- she flattens against the wall, eyes hard, and terribly hurt, too

Just stay awake and watch me -- Just wake me if it looked like was having a bad dream
(eyes wild) But you
You shit -- what do you do -- you fall asleep

Just see if he's okay

Dad -- what you doing here
It so happens  work here, and there's an unsolved murder don't like unsolved murders, especially ones my daughter's mixed up in -- what are you doing here at this hour
You're supposed to be getting some sleep
Listen, sir, this is serious
Nancy had a nightmare about Rod being in danger, or something, and so she thinks
He trails off, loosing it under  's glare
Besides, he doesn't know exactly what the hell's really going on himself

Take my word for it, Nancy
The guy's sleeping like a baby
He's not going anywhere

He's asleep, all right, but not safely so

The door's locked; she hauls on it in desperation
Now look , Nancy, don't push it
You've already rubbed my nose in sex, drugs and violence -- don't start throwing in insanity

She wheels on him and pleads, her intensity sobering even to him

By now the girl has an extraordinary look
Her hair is ashen, her skin transluscent, and eyes dark-ringed

But no movement from the kid at all

He refocuses his eyes, takes off his earphones
How can you listen to Carson and a record at the same time

Wasn't listening to the tube, just watching

Her eyes remain closed another beat, then open wide
She quietly jumps out of bed and shakes herself savagely to scatter the sleep settling so quickly
Still in the dark, she fishes a full electric coffepot from under her bed and pours herself a fresh fix into a mug she digs from beneath her pillow
The face illuminated by the neon light on the pot is set in absolute determination
drains the cup, then crosses to her closet, retrieves a pitcher of ice water from behind a heap of clothes and splashes her eyes and the back of her neck

On the bedside table with the nearly empty Pyrex coffee maker, the empty cup and the empty box of No-Doz, is her old fashioned alarm clock, and a phone

It's changed from a normal telephone mouthpiece to an actual mouth -- Fred Krueger's mouth -- and his long, slick tongue flicks out and darts into the startled girl's mouth -- as  explodes from her micro-dream -- absolutely mad
She jerks the telephone away from her and smashes it against her wall, then attacks it with her feet and hands, smashing it to smithereens

But there's no getting through
She staggers back, stymied and furious

The boy lies sprawled, still clothed, in the middle of his bed
Save for the bedside lamp, the room is dark
looking down at him as from the eyes of some great fly hung on the ceiling -- There's a heartbeat's pause
Then with tremendous force, two powerful arms shoot up beneath the red and yellow bedspread and grab  around the waist
Next moment the young man's body is dragged straight down into the bed, as if some huge beast had grabbed him and heaved him down
His feet and his arms shoot up -- there's another hauling yank -- and the boy disappears except for his hands and fingers -- down into the pit in the middle of the bed
His hands are last to go, clawing for a hold
But soon they vanish as well, dragging blankets and bedsheets, wires and stereo across the caved-in bed and into the abyss
There's   of  jamming in with 's -- then an unholy, sudden silence
Next moment what's left of  is vomited up from the pit of the nightmare bed

The man is even more hideous hatless, his bald head and tormented face veiled in skeins of ruined flesh, his ragged teeth barred, the great spider of razor-blades flashing from his fingertips
He leaps, but the girl leaps just as fast, a fierce jump, that sends her out over black space and down into a huge, dark sump of blackness

Suddenly the complex, glittering skein of light that is the San Fernando Valley seen from the air slides  , and we see she's falling from high, high over the earth

Just a few seconds from zero
She staggers for her house's front door -- but a moment later crashes down atop her

She sits on the bed, turns on the bedside lamp and re-examines her room

The  steps out of the bathroom peeling bloody rubber gloves
Pale and sweating
Found you something, Donald
Should remind you of something
The man shoves out his hand to
stares at it without touching it
long, thin steel blade, razor sharp, attached to some sort of ring and armature -- broken off
The  gives a sweaty, grim smile
() Only place  ever heard of such a thing before was ten years ago
Remember that fucker Fred Krueger
has just knocked  sprawling in his race to the stairs
Hey -- your daughter's acting kinda --
(' gone) Strange

as  breaks another window and presses against the bars
The house shudders and glows orange behind her
She sees her father bursting out the front door of Glen's house
Oh, Jesus -- Nancy
(to his men) Hey
We got a fire
202
'
Many  batter the door down as     202
black smoke pours from the windows and 's  and fill the air
Within moments they've destroyed the door and has pulled his daughter into the safety of his arms
But  immediately fights free and darts right back to the front door -- beckoning him to follow -- gesturing like a wild woman
got him --  got Fred Krueger
stares at his wild little girl in astonishment, then runs in after her
The others follow, coughing and choking
203
203
collides with  as she brakes, frozen , but whoever was locked in there certainly isn't now
The door is flat on the kitchen floor
What the hell are you talking about, Nancy
wheels without answering
series of tiny, isolated fires burn across the living room and up the stairs
Firesteps
() He's after Mom
Come on
She darts across the living room, following the flaming footprints of   up the stairs before  can stop her

-- a ragged gold-red light splashing her horrified face
205
--  , literally a man of fire, has   205
a screaming  pinned to the bed and is crawling all over her
gives a banshee's howl, snatches up a chair and brings it down over the back of the firey beast, stunning him
By the time   races into the room ' seized a heavy blanket has thrown over both of them, fighting the flames
The father joins his daughter without a second thought, heaving another blanket over the bed and smothering the last of the flames
He's under there
Watch it
206
pushes the girl back -- yanks out his
38 and pulls off   206
the first cover
No movement
He pulls back a second one, ready to fire
But the only thing he sees is the blackened half-skeleton of his ex-wife, smoking and seething and sinking into the fluid-like mattress, sinking right down through it as if she were sinking into a lake
blackened, gnarled hand goes last, then the bed solidifies over the place she's disappeared
And it's as if no one was ever there
turns and looks at  , her face white as her ghostly hair
shoves his
38 back in its holster and finds a cigarette, his hands shaking so badly he can barely manage
Now do you believe me
barges in
The room is filled with smoke, the bed is stripped, but other than that, the place seems normal
You find him
(looking closer at ) Sir
just walks by him
chases after
( ) (fading) Sir -- here, let me light that for you -- Lieutenant
What happened
(gone) ,   alone in the room
She turns and looks at the bed
slips in and builds
The bed has changed color It's now an ash-darkened red and yellow 207
from the direction of the bed
207
, and the surface of the red and yellow bed gets a bump in its center that keeps raising, raising until it's a hump that's a head and shoulders, still raising until it looms over
Then  's entire shape sweeps up into the yellow and red mass -- and the garish head, smoking and seething, pops through
-- , a burned, sizzling black hump of a killer, clumps onto the floor between  and the door
falls absoltely still, and her face goes through a strange, almost sublime transformation
(quietly) know you're there, Krueger
She turns and faces him
You think you was gonna get away from me
shakes her head
know you too well now, Freddie
smiles bitterly
Coming closer
And now you die
There's a   at his side, and he raises the only thing on him not charred -- the gleaming steel talons
208
simply shakes her head again, as if seeing a light at the    208
end of her long, long tunnel
And the way she says the words, they might be appearing on the inside of her eyes
It's too late, Krueger know the secret now -- this is just a dream, too -- you're not alive -- the whole thing is a dream -- so fuck off
want my mother and friends again
grins insanely, confused and amused at the same time
You what (even, firm) take back every bit of energy  ever gave you
You're nothing
You're shit
And then she turns her back on him
bunches his fingers, producing a single ragged bundle of razor talons and raises his hand over the back of her head and neck
closes her eyes and steps to the door
, touching the door knob
' - poised
then  as  stabs down, right through -- as if she were an optical illusion -- loosing his balance and falling down, down, down
And he's gone

'     jerks it open and blinks in the bright, diffused light
The   on a transitional note, into light
We hear
playing
Early morning
(to herself) God, it's bright
sticks her head out, squinting, and nods
Sober
Gonna burn off soon or it wouldn't be so bright
turns and looks her mother over
Feeling better
They say you've bottomed out when you can't remember the night before
(shakes her head) No more drinking, Baby, suddenly just don't feel like it any more
She touches
() Didn't keep you up last night, did
You look a little peeked
smiles
Nah
Just slept heavy
The girl gives a wave and goes off
calls after
See ya
turns and waves
See ya

as she walks to the curb
The whole scene is       210
wrapped in an unseasonal tule fog, bright yet diffuse
We notice that 's house no longer has bars on its windows
Then we see a familiar convertible pull up at the curb, top down and  are in the back seat
They all wave to  as climbs in
(calling) You believe this fog
(laughs) believe anything's possible
slaps five with
Lookin' good, girl
slips into the seat next to Someone else is driving, it seems
looks up to the The big  turns and grins at , a terrible, scarred, hideous leer of a grin --  ' grin
as its top clamps over the kids within -- a bright red and yellow top that closes as fast and hard as a beartrap
' frightened face flies to the window, pressing against the thick glass as the car roars away from the curb and into the thick fog
211
a group of  , half-hidden by the fog,    211
jumping rope and singing gayly
One two -- Freddy's coming for you
Three four -- Better lock your door
Five six -- Get your Crucifix Seven eight -- Gonna stay up late
Nine ten -- Never sleep again
