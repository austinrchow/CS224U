14, 1998 : - The hanging sign says 'Entering Cherry Falls, Ohio' We see Cherry Falls -  small town in rural Northeastern Ohio
This is Norman Rockwell land, red barns on dirt roads, a square in the center of town
But things are hidden here
The barns are locked, the shades are drawn
Dissolve to: ' romantic turn-off used exclusively for parking
river gushes by
Crickets chirp
The trees blow in the autumn wind
single car sits on the lonely road
The muffled sound of a young couple making out drifts through the streamed up windows
teenage boy's hand is under a teenage girl's shirt, gently massaging her breast
He pulls his hand out from under her shirt and places it on her bare knee
As he starts to slide his hand up her leg, she grabs his hand and gently pulls it away
She places it back on her breast, sliding it under her shirt
We pull back
and , two healthy sixteen year olds, are passionately making out in the proverbial back seat of a big American car
Rod smiles seductively, kisses Stacy, and places his hand back on her knee
Once again, she stops him, this time just squeezing his hand tightly
No
He doesn't give up easy
He playfully wrestles his hand free and slides it under her skirt
She grabs his hand again
said no
But you don't really mean it
He struggles to free his hand
Yes  do
Keep it in your pants Rod
He gives up, aggravated
Maybe it won't stay in
Maybe you better just drive me home
He starts the car, glares at her for a second, then turns it off
Let me just ask you a serious question first
What
Aren't you worried you could die a virgin
(sarcastically) Yeah
'm extremely worried about that
It's right up there with global warming
On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield
Terminate us instantly
We'd never experience what it means to make love
If sheep don't count
That wasn't me
know
'm kidding you
Chill out
Well 'm trying to be real here and you're mocking me
(softening) 'm sorry, but you're not going to die a virgin Rod
' There is another car around the bend, hidden from sight
It's an old beat up Imperial from the late sixties
Someone is watching them
It's probably a psychopath
' Rod leans in and starts kissing Stacy again
(cont
) don't wanna take that chance
want my first time to be with you
She kisses him back
He slides his hand under her skirt again
Stop it
He doesn't
Rod
(exasperated) You're being unfair
Unfair
Yes
Unfair to me
He begins to overpower her
This is quickly turning into date rape '
,   him savagely across the face
This catches his attention
He jumps back, cut slightly, surprised
She opens the car door and quickly escapes
She runs away from the car, down the road, very upset
Rod catches himself
He looks at his bloodied face in the rear view mirror and realizes what he's done
He starts up the car
Stacy runs down the road alone, still very upset
Rod pulls up next to her and rolls down his window
Stacy
'm sorry
She pays no attention to him
Please get back in the car, Stacy
She turns and heads down a path into the dark woods, purposely going where he can't follow
Rod, frustrated, hits the steering wheel and floors it
As Rod's car tears off, down the road, the other car that was parked at lover's lane drives up and pulls over, lights still off
Stacy heads deeper into the woods
When she finally stops to catch her breath and wipe away her tears, she hears someone approaching her
Suddenly, the footsteps stop
Stacy senses that someone is watching her
Rod
No answer
Is that you Rod
Still no answer
little frightened, she starts to walk again
Again she hears the footsteps following her
She stops again
Whoever is out there stops too
She looks around in every direction
Come out Rod
This  bull shit ain't gonna work with me
No answer
Even the birds have stopped chirping
(terrified) Rod
You're freaking me out
Game's over
lose
Come out and we'll fuck
She hears the footsteps behind her and quickly turns around
She sees the silhouette of someone standing a few feet away
The wind picks up
Stacy realizes it isn't Rod
All she can see is that whoever is there is carrying a small sledge hammer in one hand and a very long, jagged, steel nail in the other
(in full panic) Stacy starts to run
The killer starts after her
' Rod is sitting in his car in front of Stacy's house at the edge of the woods, waiting for her to appear
He checks his watch
Stacy runs for the edge of the woods but she isn't quite fast enough to elude her pursuer
Help
The killer catches Stacy from behind and savagely smashes her head against a tree, cracking a branch
Stacy falls to the ground, dazed
Rod sits up in his seat, thinking he's heard something Stacy, half conscious, bleeding from the head, is dragged back deeper into the woods
' Rod gets out of the car and cautiously moves to the edge of the dark woods
Rod's  - The woods are pitch black
Stacy
(
) (struggling, in the distance) The killer kicks Stacy in the side, instantly shutting her up
He gags her and ties her to a tree trunk
She struggles, but she's no match for the killer
Rod grabs his flashlight from the glove compartment
Rod's flashlight beam frantically cuts through the woods
Rod charges through the woods, desperately looking for any sign of Stacy
Stacy's right hand is raised above her head and placed, palm out, against a tree trunk
Rod searches for Stacy, his flashlight jaggedly cutting the darkness
The huge nail, extremely sharp and jagged, is placed in the center of Stacy's outstretched palm
The hammer is pulled back, aimed at the head of the nail
Rod stops and frantically looks around, knowing he's fighting a losing battle
Stacy
The hammer descends on the nail
Stacy screams out in pain, even through the gag, as he hand is nailed to the tree
Rod hears her muffled cry and runs toward the sound
Stacy's left hand is now placed up against a different tree
Another nail is readied
Stacy tries to free her nailed hand but it's useless
She goes into shock
Rod's flashlight continues to cut through the night
His feet trample fallen branches
Suddenly, he stops
He's found her
Stacy is stretched out between two trees, gagged, one hand nailed to each tree
She almost looks crucified
Rod, starts toward her, not sure what to do
He looks into Stacy's terrified eyes
She's looking behind him
Rod quickly turns around but he's too late
knife comes plunging down toward Rod's chest
Stacy frantically tries to free herself but she only succeeds in ripping her palms on the nails
Rod falls to his knees, blood streaming from his chest and mouth
Stacy can't even react anymore, she's so horrified
The killer's hand rips open Stacy's shirt and feels her soft ripe stomach
Stacy looks down, terrified of what the killer has planned
small but extremely sharp razor attached to the end of a pencil is placed up against Stacy's bare stomach
The killer's hand grips it like it's an ordinary pencil
Stacy's eyes grow abnormally wide as the carving starts
She's never experienced such pain
Blood drips to the ground
Dissolve to: The full moon looks down on the town
Another romantic turn off
view from the top of a hill overlooking the sleepy town
lonely car sits there, the sound of a teenage couple making out drifting through it's steamed up windows
It's almost a repeat of the first scene
The boy pulls his hand from under the girl's shirt and unsnaps her jeans
She pushes his hand away but he puts it right back, wriggling a finger down into her pants
, a pretty all-American sixteen year old girl, strong willed but still innocent, stops kissing her boyfriend , trying to hold him off
Kenny is also sixteen
He's thin and a bit shaggy, but very cute nonetheless
His hair is shoulder length, his stare intense
He takes himself seriously, all rebel
Cut it out
Why
was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago
So
You're already late
few more minutes won't matter
He slides a second finger into her pants
She closes her legs, making his probing much more difficult
got to get home
Fuck your curfew
Most sixth graders can stay out later than you
He starts kissing her again
Kenny
She pulls his hand out of her pants
He stares at her for a second, completely exasperated
He sits up and starts the car
The car squeals away
Jody and Kenny drive home, not talking
He pulls up in front of her house
You know, maybe we ought to start seeing other people
What
Jody, we've been going out for over a year
love you but 'm all out of patience
Jody doesn't know what to say
She didn't expect this
Jody gets out of the car, very upset
Kenny takes off, not even waiting to see if she gets inside safely, leaving her all alone on the dark street car backfires in the distance
nearby noise  startles her
Something's behind the garbage cans
She heads quickly up the driveway, disappearing behind the house
'  - All is quiet in the house
The back door opens
Jody tiptoes up back staircase
' Jody appears on the second floor
It's a family house, politely decorated and immaculately clean
She quietly creeps down the hallway toward her room
As she passes her parents' room, she looks down
She's relieved that no light is coming from under their door
' Jody creeps into her bedroom and quietly shuts the door
She's made it
She sits on the bed to catch her breath
Something moves in the corner of her room
Jody jumps, scared
Someone is sitting in her rocking chair
It's almost ten o'clock
Daddy you scared me
You're grounded Friday night
What
' gets up and heads to the door
He's a big man, 45 years old, well built
He's dressed in a  tree-shirt and jeans
Your curfew is 9:30 and you know it, little miss
It won't happen again
You said that two weeks ago
Dad
Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends
They're not all the sheriff's daughter
Goodnight
He leaves
Jody is furious
She lies down on the bed to stew
She might at well have stayed out
The phone in the hallway rings
She leaps up
Jody runs up to the phone but waits for it to ring a second time before picking it up
She crosses her fingers, praying it's Kenny
Hello
(beat) One second
(to her dad) Hey Adolph, it's the station
Brent comes out and picks up the phone as Jody heads back to her room, disappointed
Jody flops on the bed
(
) Hello
(beat) What
Brent it shocked
Where
, Jody's mother, comes out of the bedroom, sensing something terrible has happened
Marge is a couple of years older than Brent
She's a bit lifeless, a pretty woman who's whole life is her daughter and a bottle of Peachtree Schnapps
(') 'm on my way
' Jody sits up on her bed, also sensing something big has happened
Brent buttons up his shirt
What happened
Two kids were found mutilated in the woods
Lock the door after me
Brent grabs his gun belt and heads down the stairs
Jody appears
She and her mom share a concerned glance
: ' Brent pulls up
lot of official cars are already there
trail of flares eerily light up the woods, leading to the crime scene
The murder sit
Police cameras flash
Stacy is still nailed to the tree
Rod is dead on the ground below her in a puddle of his own blood
Brent walks up, immediately repulsed by the gruesome sight
His deputy, , sidles up next to him
Her parents reported her missing about an hour ago
flash bulb momentarily lights up the scene
Brent pulls out his flashlight to better survey the carnage
He starts on Rod, throat slit, chest gutted
He then moves to Stacy, looking at one nailed hand, then the other
What kind of a person wakes up in the morning and says to themselves, 'Think 'll nail a sixteen year old girl to a tree today'
The same type that decides to carve into her stomach
Brent finally shines the flashlight beam on Stacy's stomach
Carved into her flesh is the word ''
: High school kids are getting ready for school
Body parts are being covered
Pants and stocking are pulled up over bare teenage legs
Shirts and bras cover bare teenage chests
Zippers are pulled tight
Buttons are buttoned
The school bell rings and the kids arrive in cars, on bikes, walking
'   small town American high school, somewhat repressed but alive
The news spreads quickly about the double killing as the crowd splits into its various tribes: punk rockers, jocks, potheads, cheerleaders, nerds
The killing is on everyone's mind
Jody rides up on her bike and glances across the schoolyard as she locks it in the bike rack
Jody's  - Kenny is leaning against a tree, talking with a busty girl, Jody is upset to see Kenny flirting with someone else
As she starts toward the front door of the school, a few other  run up to her
She keeps glancing over at Kenny but he doesn't notice her
1 Jody
Hi
2 Was Stacy raped
dunno
My dad never came home last night
Jody's  - Kenny takes Sharon's hand for a second
1(
) bet she was
heard someone stuffed a tent spike up her ass
2(
) Gives new meaning to the idea of getting 'nailed'
1(
) Ha-ha
So funny
Sickfuck
Jody doesn't respond
She stares at Kenny
Jody's  - Kenny walks into school with Sharon
: Jody enters her homeroom, still upset
Her teacher   is lecturing the class
Leonard is twenty- five and quite hip looking for a teacher
He has long somewhat stringy brown hair
He is a bit thin and is dressed casually, almost in hippy attire
He wears wire-rim glasses and lace-up boots
No one understands what leads people to do irrational things
We only know that unpunished violence festers, then explodes
Jody sits down in the back
(') Witness the
Riots
Years of police brutality in forty-eight hours
Jody
Yes Mr
Marliston
Your dad's in the principal's office
He wants to see you
' Brent is talking to  , the principal
Tom is a wiry, hard featured man in his mid-forties
They have known each other for a long time but are not really friends
Brent knows Tom too well
Tom's a cynical bastard
Tom is examining the photos taken at the crime scene
You aren't planning to tell these kids that 'virgin' was tattooed into both Stacy and Rod, are you
No
Good
But  am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends
Fine, just don't mention the carving This is going to be a tough enough day as it is
There's a knock at the door
Jody enters
Hi honey
Hi Daddy
Hi Mr
Sisler
Hi Jody
just wanted to check that you were okay
'm fine
've just never had someone my age die before
It's so weird
How well did you know Stacy and Rod
've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything
Had either of them broken up with someone recently
Hurt someone
No
Those two were together before Kenny and  started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now
want you to head right home after school
will
Is that all
Could you tell Mr
Marliston we'd like to see him
She leaves
Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston
The kids adore him
They confide in him
His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins
Why didn't you ask Jody that
She's my daughter, Tom
So
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex
Why not
You worried you might find out how much she actually knows
Brent gives Tom a 'keep your cynical shit off my daughter' look
You rang
Come in Leonard
Have you met Brent Marken
No but 've always wanted to
He shakes his hand firmly
Nice to meet you too
My daughter speaks highly of you
Leonard examines Brent's face carefully
Brent is a little taken aback by his intensity
We have the same color eyes
guess we do
: , a seventeen year old, rail thin pothead is sitting at a table in the crowded cafeteria eating lunch
The place is a zoo
, a cute, mini-skirted brunette, and ,  a frizzy-haired, tattooed, pierced, punk- rocker, are sitting with him
Jody is standing at the door with her best friend , looking for a place to sit
Sandy is thin and a little underdeveloped for her age
She is wearing very little make-up, a baggy shirt and baggy jeans
Although she looks much more tomboyish than Jody and a year or two younger, she is still quite cute and curvy, just lacking a  bit in self-confidence when it comes to boys
Sandy is staring at Mark
Go sit next to him
Who
Mark Shale
Why
Don't you want to talk to him
You watch him eat everyday
don't watch him eat everyday
You stare at him non-stop, like every lunch
Like this
Like most people stare at car accidents
Jody imitates Sandy
The seat behind him is open
Come on, can eavesdrop too
You eventually have to talk to him
Why
All my mom and dad ever do is watch each other eat and they've been married for twenty years
Cindy sees Jody approaching and motions her over
Jody
Jody starts toward her table
No
That's his table
You're going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now
The other three kids look up as Jody sits don
Sandy has no choice but to sit down next to Mark
She immediately freezes up
Did your dad question you this morning
Just a little
Did he ask you if Stacy and Rod has ever exchanged bodily fluids
No
Why
He asked Marliston
If they had ever gone all the way
Yeah
Chris wonder why it's so important to know if they fucked
Sandy is completely frozen
Jody realizes it
Mark is paying no attention to her
What  don't understand is why they asked Marliston if Rod was a virgin
They could have asked you Cindy
never fucked Rod
Exactly
Then he must be a virgin
Jody nudges Sandy under the table, trying to prompt her to say something
Sandy can only stare at Mark as he eats
(
) If 'm so all-used-up Ben, why do you try to hook me up non-stop
(
) As fucking if
Across the cafeteria, a sophomore  storms in very upset
She confronts , her junior boyfriend
You're a shitsucking liar
(taunting) Better than being a 'cocksucking' liar
Shut your face
Annette leaps on Dylan and starts violently scratching him
Mr
Marliston runs over and pulls her off
He drags Annette away
He's been telling people
You can tell me all about it in my office
Calm down
We're all on edge today
He guides her out
Sandy gets up her nerve and makes eye contact with Mark
What's up with that
Mark opens a  and starts to eat it
Dylan's been telling people that Annette gave him a blow job
And she didn't
Ben and Mark laugh
There's a better chance that he got head from all five Spice Girls
That's horrible
Cindy laughs at Sandy
Sandy doesn't appreciate being laughed at
think it's funny
Me too
'm going to start telling people that  saw her drop to her knees and latch on to his unit vector
Cindy laughs
The first meeting hasn't gone well for Sandy
Jody feels for her and jumps to her rescue
You wouldn't
would if Dylan paid me
The bell rings
It's the end of the day
All the kids charge out
Jody walks out with Sandy
(flustered) What am  supposed to say
'Nice sweater Mark'
'Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer's
' (teasing a bit) You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff
You are 'sp fucking' wrong
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton
Everyone wants to meet you
Party with you
Have sex with you
But you can't do any of it
So it sucks
always have to 'set an example'
Jody stops, noticing something
Jody's  - Kenny is walking to his car with Sharon
Sandy sees how upset Jody is
He's just trying to mess with your head
Ignore him
Does she fuck
(trying to comfort) doubt it
Who'd want to fuck her
She probably reeks worse than the docks down in those panties
: Jody is slowly pedaling her bicycle next to Sandy
(frustrated) Mr
Jenkins called on me in class today
It was so embarrassing
was seriously spaced
'd been thinking about Kenny for over twenty minutes
When  snapped out of it,  looked pathetic
was teared up
Everyone was staring at me
What did you say
That  was sorry
'd drifted off
That 'd been thinking about Stacy and Rod
Oh nice save
was desperate
It was gross
Kenny'll come running back
This is just his way of pressuring you
He says he loves me
Personally  think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you
But  suppose that's a type of love
certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me
(musing) Maybe  should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out
No
You're the one always saying 'Just do it'
That was before he pulled this 'Dick me or  dump you' shit
say fuck his best friend
Jody laughs
don't know what 'm so scared of
Want to come in for awhile
Log onto , flirt with some married men, head into a private & chat room
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you
keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference
Jody laughs
promised 'd go right home after school
increase the peace
Sandy hip-hops up her driveway and into her house
Jody jumps on her bike and pedals off down the street
Dissolve to: - Night has set again on the town
An
The killer's car, the black , lurks in the shadows of a suburban street
The killer is staking out a specific house
' Annette, the girl who flipped out in the cafeteria appears at the front door
Her  and  are going out
They kiss  goodbye, get in their car and drive away
Annette heads back inside and double locks the door
Annette's parents pull up in front of a restaurant and head inside
'   up across the street
The killer's car drives away
' gloved finger pushes in the back doorbell
Annette opens the back door
It's chain locked
She peeks through the chain, Someone is standing there in the shadows
(
) Annette
It's a '
: Annette has never seen this woman before
still don't see the killer's face
(suspicious) Yeah
(
) 'm Lisa Sherman
Dylan's aunt
He asked me to come talk to you
Why
(
) He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school
(really angry) He should
Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating
(
) think  know how to restore your reputation
(excited) You do
(
) Can  come in
'll need to use the phone
Annette isn't sure what to do but this is too important to pass up
Sure
Annette unlocks the chain
The killer heads inside
closes behind them
Wine is being poured into already half-filled glasses
Annette's parents and the other couple are now a little tipsy, much looser than when we saw them earlier
They are laughing, rubbing each other, getting physical
The other  leans in and kisses Annette's' mother on the nose
Annette's father is at first taken aback but then he responds by kissing the other  on the ear
They all laugh
It's getting fancy for Cherry Falls
- comes charging down the hallway, groggy, bleeding profusely from the side of her head, terrified
Help
More wine is poured
The two couples eye each other, giggling
Annette charges into her bedroom and slams the door behind her, locking it
She quickly pulls her dresser in front of the door
The door handle moves
The killer is on the other side
Annette picks up the telephone
it's dead
The killer kicks the door a couple of times
Annette backs away from the door, all the way to the window
She grabs a sharp pen, holding it like it's a knife
The kicking stops, All is momentarily quiet
Suddenly the killer's shadow appears in the window behind Annette
The window smashes an d Annette's neck is pulled towards the shards of glass that remain in the broken window
Annette struggles but she's not strong enough
Under the table, the other man puts his hand on Annette's mom's knee
Annette's mom smiles at the man, drunk and interested
The killer lowers Annette's throat closer to the shard of glass
Annette's mom pushes the man's hand under her dress
Annette's throat touches the glass
She's all but lost
Annette's mom lets out a huge  laugh, knocking over her red win, soaking the white tablecloth in red
Annette's eyes roll up into her head
Annette, half alive is dragged out the window
Out come the hammer and nails
: Annette's parents pull into the driveway: They are still giggling
It's been a great night
They are sauced
Annette's parents come inside
Annette
We're home
She notices a red spot on the carpet and leans over to inspect it
Annette's mom starts down the hallway, noticing the trail of blood leading to Annette's door, realizing something is wrong
(concerned) Annette
She tugs at Annette's door
The door is still barricaded
Her mother frantically tugs at the door
Her dad appears
Annette
Her dad lifts his foot and starts kicking at the door
It begins to splinter
They break through
Annette's dad pushes the dresser out of the way and they barge in
The room seems to be empty except the window has been broken and blood's splattered around it
Annette
She notices the shade to the other window has been drawn and is flapping oddly, caught on something
She walks over, frightened, gathers her nerve, then pulls the shade up
Annette has been nailed to the outside of the house, her dead eyes looking in
'' is carved deeply in her forehead
Her mother screams
: Cars are everywhere
Brent is staring at the word '', carved into Annette's forehead
He's really worried, He's figured out that his town is under siege
Annette's parents are downstairs, shocked
They hug each other, having nowhere else to turn
: Brent enters his own house
Marge is waiting for him
Is Jody still awake
She just turned off her light
Brent darts up the stairs
' Jody is in bed
There's a soft knock on the door
She rolls over
Come in
Brent walks in and seats himself on the edge of the bed
Hi honey
What's wrong
have a question to ask you
personal question
Jody sits up, pulling the covers up over her breasts
(uncomfortable) How personal
Brent takes a deep breath
He's really uncomfortable
need to know how far you and Kenny went
Jody is really uncomfortable with this question
What do you mean
(gently probing) Well,  assume you let him kiss you
Well yeah
Of course
Everyone kisses
'm not criticizing
(very uncomfortable)_ Did you two get any further
little
How much further
Daddy
' wouldn't ask if  didn't have to
Not much further
You never went, uh, all the way
(sighs) No
Brent nods, worried
He's obviously upset
(very worried) Ok
(confused) Daddy, are you upset that 'm still a virgin
No honey
You are upset
'm not
(upset) thought you'd be pleased
am
'm so very proud of you
Go back to sleep
He kisses her on the forehead and heads out
She is very confused
Brent comes down the stairs
Well
She's still a virgin
Did you warn her
No
Let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep
It's a new day
As the kids arrive at school, rumors are flying
Everyone is a little more on edge
The same tribes exist but kids are starting to glance and listen to kids from other tribes
The social structure is starting to fray
' Brent is upset, confused
If 'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today
Oh  Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about
is there anything you do
Focus on the present
You always want to change the past
Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday
'm going to tell them everything  know
'm calling a town meeting for eight p
m
You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands
Better than a pile of dead teenagers
The town bell rings in the steeple
It's eight o'clock
The shops close down
All the townsfolk head toward the assembly hall
The parents arrive
They are all concerned
They've all heard rumors by now
They hurry into the school, whispering to one another
The parents are seated, whispering, buzzing
Brent walks up to the podium
He's very nervous as he looks out at the crowd, realizing he's going to really, really upset them
He takes a deep breath
think you all know why Town meeting
In the last two days, three of our children have been murdered and it appears that we have now established a common link between the killings
The crowd grows still
Everyone is interested in this information
Brent pauses
1 Well, what is it
All three of the victims attended our public high school and all three were or appear to have been
um
virgins
There is a ripple of confusion that runs through the auditorium
1 So
2 (very concerned) You're almost positive that's who this monster is targeting
1 Virgins
We found the word 'virgin' written at both crime scenes
1 Why didn't you tell us this yesterday
We didn't think this was a serial killer
We thought it was an isolated incident
This is all very upsetting to everyone
3 Are you close to an arrest
can't say we are
2 What are we supposed to do
What do you mean
2 What are we supposed to tell our kids
2 To go out and get laid if they wanna feel safe
think that's' up to each and everyone of you
3 can't lock my daughter in the basement
2 wouldn't worry about it Victor
few other parents laugh
3 What's that supposed to mean
2 Nothing
3 What are you saying about my daughter
Father 3 starts towards Father 2
Tempers are short
2 (getting worried) Calm down
was joking
Father 3 pushes Father 2
3 Hell of a time to be joking about a thing like that you sick bastard
Father 3 swings at him
fight ensues
Other parents start to jump in
Tempers are short
Brent leaps down to break it up
match lights a long fuse
Fire crackles along the ground toward a huge string of firecrackers and Roman candles
They ignite
The firecrackers explode as balls of fire shoot into the night sky
howl
' Jody is talking on the phone to Sandy
Sandy's room is typical teenage room, identical in feel to Jody's
(really worried) What are we going to do
' Jody is lying on her bed
Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins
He can't butcher all of us
There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night
The killer's imperial pulls up across the street from Jody's
' Not that many
You watch
There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow
Maybe 'll finally talk to Mark Shale
There's a sound on the phone
Sandy's brother  has picked it up
Andy
'm on the phone
' , Sandy's thirteen year old brother is on the line
(  ) just wanted to offer my services to Jody
Your services
'm willing to help save her life
Jody, if you want to come over right now
We could slip up into the attic for a few minutes
There's an old mattress up there
Andy hangs up laughing
' Jody chuckles but all of a sudden the line goes dead
Hello
Jody tries to call back but the phone isn't working
This spooks her
The doorbell rings downstairs
Now Jody is more than spooked
She's
She goes to the window to see who it is
Someone is standing in the shadows below
All Jody can make out is that it's a woman
Jody, dressed only in her nightshirt, cautiously heads downstairs to the back door
looks through the back door window
There's someone in the shadows
Jody opens the door a crack
Yes
(
) Are you Jody
Once again, a woman's voice
Yeah
(
) 'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa
Kenny's aunt
(
) Yes
He asked me to come over and talk to you
Jody senses something is off
On what side of the family
(
) His mother's side
His mother's an only child
Jody suddenly gets it and tries to slam the door closed but the killer is too fast, sliding a hand and foot in, pushing her way into the house
Jody fights to push the door shut but she can't
The killer is stronger
The killer's hand gropes for the lock latch
Jody frantically looks around for a weapon and spots an electric screwdriver sitting in the back pantry
She grabs for the screwdriver with one hand as the killer pushes harder
Jody drills the killer's elbow
The killer screams and lets go
Jody slams the door shut, double locking it
Jody runs to the front hall and double locks the front door
Jody picks up a phone but it's dead downstairs too
She looks around
She notices a shadow move across the back window
The killer hasn't left
The killer seems to be following her
Jody grabs a baseball bat from the front hall closet
The killer's shadow appears outside
Jody runs into the kitchen, grabs a knife
The window above her breaks
The killer is right outside
Jody runs into the dining room, not sure where to go
Suddenly the window breaks there
The killer is stalking her from the outside
- is under siege and Jody is trapped in it
She runs from room to room, turning the lights out but windows break wherever she goes
It's terrifying
Suddenly there is a silence
Jody stops running
She realizes that the killer must be climbing in somewhere
Jody isn't sure what to do
She hears something in the family room
Jody enters
She sees the killer's shadow cross the window
She runs out
Jody creeps through the dark house, unsure where to go
Jody creeps back into the den
The killer doesn't seem to be there either
The window is broken
The curtains flap in the breeze
She moves toward it, wondering whether it's safe to climb out
She looks in the mirror
In the mirror, Jody can see the killer's shoes peeking out from under the drapes
The killer's in the room
The drapes start to move
Jody turns around and swings the bat, hitting the killer squarely in the head, sending her to the ground, pulling the drapes down
Jody tears for the front door
Jody's too nervous to unlock the front door
She hears the killer coming so she tears up the stairs
Jody scampers up the staircase but she's not fast enough
The killer grabs her leg through the wooden slatted banister starts pulling her off the staircase, breaking the wooden slats
Jody grabs one of the jagged slats and rams the sharp end into the killer's hand, freeing herself
Jody charges up the stairs and into the bathroom
Jody closes the bathroom door and locks it
The killer starts kicking it in
Jody opens the small bathroom window to climb out on the roof
The door starts to splinter
Jody tries to wriggle her way out but it's tight
Behind her she hears the door splintering open
Jody squeezes through and grabs hold of the chimney, using it to pull herself out
The killer's hand grabs Jody's leg just as Jody's pulling herself free
The killer closes the window on Jody's leg, trapping it inside
Out comes the razor
Jody fights for her freedom, tugging at the chimney, kicking and screaming: All of a sudden she feels a surge of pain
She screams and kicks with all her might, freeing herself, her momentum sending her rolling down the roof
She rolls off the roof, barely grabbing hold of the gutter, hanging from it
The gutter starts to break
Above her she can hear the killer coming out onto the roof
The killer's silhouette hovers above, ready to grab her
Jody knows she has no choice
Jody lets go of the gutter
Jody falls twenty feet to the ground below
Help
Jody smashes to the ground
' neighbor hears the clatter and comes running out to see what's going on
Jody lies still on the ground
The killer, still in silhouette, looks down from the roof
Jody's neighbor runs over to help her
Jody rolls over, still groggy
Jody looks up to the roof
Jody looks back down at her bloody leg
There is a '' carved into it
: Later that night
Police cars are lined up outside the house
Police are scouring the house
Jody is trying to sup some hot chocolate but her hands are still shaking
It was a she
Are you sure
She said she was Kenny's aunt Lisa
Her mom comes in with a bottle of cognac, ready to pour a little into Jody's cup
What are you doing
This will relax her
She's underage
Brent motions towards the cops, his co-workers, who are scurrying around the house
Mom gives Brent a dirty look and pours just a spot into Jody's glass
Sandy enters
She sees Jody and runs to her
Oh my god
Jody breaks into tears
They hug
Someone tried to kill me
The phone just went dead
called the police and ran right over as fast as  could
Sandy is really terrified too
Dissolve to: Another morning in
The town may look peaceful but it isn't
' Sandy is getting dressed in her usual manner but he hand is shaking
She's still terrified
She looks at herself in the mirror and decides to make a change
Lipstick goes on
mascara and eyeliner follow
Sandy examines herself in the mirror
She's all made-up
wears a tenth as much
' Sandy slides into a slightly provocative dress
She looks much hotter than she did when we first met her
Sandy starts down the stairs
She stops to check out where her mother is
'  is making breakfast
Sandy hurries downstairs, grabs her coat and heads out the door, hoping her mom won't notice how she's dressed
Her mom hears her and catches a glimpse of her new outfit
You're wearing a skirt
Sandy doesn't want to get into it
She charges right out the door
Bye mom
' Sandy goes tearing up the street as her mother opens the door after her
No way is Sandy turning around
The kids arrive at School
Everyone is freaked
The word spreads fast about Jody's attack
Many of the kids, like Sandy, have worn a little extra make-up or a little tighter jeans
There's a sexual electricity everywhere mixed in with a lot of fear
The normal tribes are disbanding
What are forming in their place are sexual tribes
Today, at the high school, sexual history bands kids together
Not aesthetics, popularity, or wealth
Punkers chat with nerds, cheerleaders with potheads
In the parking lot, we see that Aunt Lisa's  is parked
The killer is close by
Sandy arrives at school
She looks around
She spots Mark talking with Cindy and
She gathers her confidence up, unbuttons her top button to reveal what cleavage she has, and starts towards them
Cindy is laughing at Ben
'm not fucking you
Not for all your
You want me to die
thought you and  were tight
that impress you
that what it takes to impress the empress
Your mind is just twisted enough
believe you'd do all this just to get a dip or two
Sandy walks up
Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben
Hi Sandy
They all stare at her for a second, noticing the change in her appearance
Did you want something
Sandy freezes
She doesn't known what to say
(almost frozen) Yes
(beat)  was just curious Mark, if you brought a Twinkie today
Ben and Cindy crack up
That was a really lame, stupid question
(sarcastically) You wonder about that everyday Sandy
Shut up Ben
(to sandy) Actually, my mom always packs two
You got a great mom
'm lucky to get a zucchini stick
Did you want one
(trying to cover) Yeah  was talking about Twinkies the other day and  realized  hadn't had one in years
Then  remembered seeing you with one
They're tasty
He gets out the Twinkie and gives it to her
She unwraps it and takes a bite
Ben and Cindy watch, amazed and entertained
Thanks
Sandy gets  a little cream on her cheek and licks it away with her tongue, a little embarrassed
The sight of her tongue turns Mark on
You can have both if you want
No, you keep one
Cindy laughs
The pairing up has started
: Jody is sitting in the police station working with a
little larger nose
The artist makes a change
How's that
Jody re-examines the picture
She's spooked
That's her
The artist picks up the phone and dials
Brent, we got a sketch
Brent comes into the room and picks up the sketch, we see a picture of the killer
She looks about eighteen years old and has her hair done in an old fashioned wave
She looks like your average small town girl from the late sixties
Brent's face goes white when he sees who it is
Jody notices this
You know her
It can't be
Who is she Daddy
Never mind darling
You go back to school
don't want you missing anymore classes today
He picks up the picture and heads quickly into his own office
Jody watches through his window, sensing he's very, very upset
Brent picks up the phone and quickly dials a number
Jody has never seen her dad like this
She quietly picks up the phone and listens in
Her dad is talking to the principal, Tom Sisler
'
But she still looks like we're eighteen
(on phone) That's impossible
(growing frantic) swear to God
It's her
She told Jody she was Kenny's ' '
'm getting this sickly feeling
Calm down Brent
Brent looks out and sees that  is on the phone, eavesdropping
'll call you right back
Jody, busted, hangs up
Brent comes storming out
is livid
' You were eavesdropping
(a little scared) No  wasn't
What did you hear
Nothing
just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you
You didn't say goodbye
Ok
Goodbye
Now get back to school
She nods and heads out, freaked
Her father's never treated her this harshly before
As Jody approaches the high school, she's still on the edge, given the attack of the night before as well as he dad's reaction to the picture
She hears a moan coming from behind some bushes
She stops and notices a Girl's shoe sticking out from under the bush
Worried it might be someone badly hurt, she cautiously starts toward it
Suddenly a couple of more feet pop out
Jody jumps back, frightened, but then realizes that it's just a  couple of her classmates having sex in the bushes
Jody heads toward the main school entrance
She starts noticing a lot of kids are outside, a few more hidden from sight, having sex
Something's up
Jody opens her locker
Sandy comes running up to her, very excited
You ok
(noticing Sandy's attire) Are you
Hurricane Hormone
it's flattened the whole school
Guess what
What
(whispering) Mark invited me to the party
What party
Shh
Ben's party
Tonight
Haven't you heard
No
Sandy notices that a teacher is nearby
Sandy pulls Jody into a stairwell
Jody is now really intrigued
(whispering) You can't tell your parents
Ok
Especially not your dad
won't
(whispering) It's like a pop your cherry party
Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight
Unless he makes a move during seventh period
Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time
(very excited) kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night
It'll be a lot less scary
You have to go
Stag
Kenny'll want to go with you
Cindy's holding a  and session at the bleachers
Come on
can't right now
Jody, you have to go to the party
For your own safety
Sandy takes off
Cindy is setting with a group of girls, the center of attention
You all are such hypocrites
All year long you sit on your judgmental little butts and call me the slut from hell
, quaking in fear, for advice
1 Yeah
2 What were we supposed to call you Cindy
1 The slut from heaven
3 Just answer our questions please
Sandy runs up
(loving the role) What do you want to know
3 What to do
You have to do everything Boys are totally clueless when it comes to sex
This answer terrifies the audience
(cont'd) It starts with them trying to unhook our bras, fumbling around, and never changes
Wait until they try to put their dicks in you
2 Please don't say they need our help with that
Always
Unless you want them to just poke around endlessly
The girls had no idea
Three stoners are smoking a bowl in their car
They are not nearly as collaborative or supportive of one another as the girls were
1 Romeo here asked me if chicks has two holes or three
2 did not
1 You did so
2 was kidding
3 Were not dude
1 know it's a total bummer that three kids are dead, but, 'm sorry, this is kind of great
3 'm way into this
This may be the best of all possible worlds
2 No
The killer could be offing chicks who haven't given head
They all laugh again and nod, slapping hands, Beavis and Butt-head style
2 Then 'd only have to worry about one
They all laugh again
Two  , one rail thin, the other slightly overweight, walk back towards the school
1 We'll meet someone at the party
2 You don't know that
1 If we don't, we sit back and watch everyone else camel
That's got to be better than hanging at your house
2 'm not going
They notice a group of kids huddled around a car
1 What's that
They walk up
'' has been written in blood on one of the windshields
mutilated boy looks out of the driver's window of the car
The girl's faces go white
'
More and more kids gather around the murder site
The kids are all freaked, giving each other the eye
No one wants to be next
All of a sudden the body moves, screaming to the heavens, freaking all the kids out
The dead body leaps out of the car and runs away as other kids and teachers run over
Everyone heard the scream
Homely girl 2 whispers to her friend
2 (whispering) Ok
Pick me up at seven
Chaos has taken over the school
Hardly anyone is still going to classes
Kenny is standing in the hallway, looking for Jody
He knows her class schedule and that she'll be passing by
Jody appears from her classroom
She starts toward Kenny, at first not noticing him
Jody looks up and she sees him
She stops
She knows what he's there to talk to her about
He runs over to her
(very concerned) Are you
'm fine
heard you got attacked
did
was worried about you
Did you hear about the bash
Yeah
think it's really sick
Why
Three of our classmates are dead
That's not really the occasion for a party
Nobody wants to be the fourth
Please go with me
Did Sharon say no
You know  want to go with you
'm so flattered but  can't
'm grounded
Everyone's grounded
There's a killer on the loose
No 'm really grounded
When  got in late the other night, my father was waiting up for me
He grabs her passionately
If you don't want to go with me just say so
Say 'Kenny,  ' ' but don't use your dad as an excuse
'm so sick of it
'm not using him as an excuse
Yes you are
You always do
It's why we broke up
You always hide behind him
do not
feel like    ' permission just to kiss you
Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl
An individual
'm going to this party tonight
Jimmy's my ride
Come over to my house after school
We'll go together
have to go home after school
have something really important have to ask my mom
They're not picking me up until six
'll think about it
Yes
He kisses her full throttle
She's into it
She smiles at him as he darts off
She's happy but scared
She's got her guy back, at least for the moment
The clock strikes three
The bell rings
Kids charge out, ready for a memorable evening
' Jody's mother is in the kitchen, preparing dinner, watching
(on ) series of savage killings has turned this small community of Cherry Falls, Ohio inside out
In the last two days, three teenagers have been killed, a fourth attacked
The killer seems to be targeting high school virgins
Here's our  reporter Mike Stanton outside the local high school with an up to the minute report
turns around toward the high school to report on the day's events but before he can get a word out a young  who has recognized him, walks up to him
Her  giggle behind her
Hi
Hi, 'm Mike Stanton
know
She grabs him and kisses him
He's shocked
She runs off giggling with her friends
boy walks through in the background and makes a lewd hip humping gesture at the  camera
Jody's mom can't believe what she's seeing on the news
Jody walks in the back door
Her mom flips off the   Jody enters the kitchen
Hi mom
Hi princess
Mom
Yes
need to ask you something
You can ask me anything
Have you ever heard of someone named Lisa Sherman
Mom's cutting hand starts to shake
She pretends that she doesn't know who Lisa Sherman is but she obviously does
Lisa Sherman
Yeah
Who is she
don't know
Where did you hear that name
overheard daddy mentioning her to someone
he thinks she's the killer
What
That's what he said
Did he say anything else about her
No but he got really weird
Like 've never seen him act
angry and super uptight
(lying) 've never heard of her
Maybe something else was on his mind
No
think she lived her a long time ago
Like twenty-eight years ago
When dad was eighteen
Not that  know of
Jody is suspicious
Jody thinks for a moment, then picks her coat back up
Where are you going
The library
'll be fine
Jody heads out the door
Her mother goes to the window, very concerned and watches her ride away
She picks up the phone
- ' is on the phone
His deputy is with him
What's the address
Thanks
He hangs up the phone
You found her
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here
Over the Indiana border
'm going
We need you here
can bring her in
No
'll handle this
Brent and the deputy head into the main station area
Brent grabs his gun
The   is on the phone
Sir, we're getting calls from other towns
Boys throughout the country have heard about what's going on here and they're heading our way, apparently, looking for girls
Put a squad car at every entrance to town
The desk sergeant picks up another call
Your wife's on line three
can't talk to her now
There's a problem with Jody
Tell her she has to handle it
He heads outside
The deputy walks Brent to his car
As bizarre as it may sound, seems someone is planning to have a big party tonight
No
Should we close down any eruption
Are you sure
We're seeing all the signs in town
like the idea of all the kids in one place
If it happens, just keep a man outside until you hear from me
'll be back in a couple of hours
He jumps in his car and speeds away
The gray old ivy-covered town library
Jody rides up and heads inside
Jody enters the vast library
It's empty
Almost spooky
seventy year old lady,   is behind the desk, robotically stamping the back flaps of books
Hi Jody
What can   for you
Hi Miss Dunlop
Where do you keep the old town papers
They're all on microfiche
What year are you looking for
Twenty eight years ago
Follow me
- They head up the stairs and into the microfilm room
This place is empty
Everyone's getting ready for the party
You heard about that
Of course Kids were whispering about it all day
Don't you think it's sick
Not at all
In fact,  thought about going
You Miss Dunlop
She hands Jody the microfiche
Unfortunately  qualify
Think 'm too old
(lying) No
You're sweet
really wish someone had thrown a party like that when  was your age
My life might have been very different
cut to: - The newspaper headlines from 1970 pass by
Jody is watching them flash by
She slows down, then goes back
She's found what she's looking for
picture of
It's her yearbook picture
She looks eerily identical to the picture that Jody drew
The headline reads 'High School Senior Attacked In park'
Jody hears footsteps coming up the stairs
She looks up
The footsteps stop
The old library is still
She senses that someone is watching her
(a little scared) Is that you Miss Dunlop
No answer
She hears a bit of rustling from behind one of the shelves of books directly behind her
book accidentally drops to the ground
She realizes that someone is right there, watching her
Who's there
She sees a pair of shoes behind the book shelf but she can't see the face
The shoes start around the book shelf, toward her
Jody leaps to her feet, ready to run
Her mom appears
Mom
You were spying on me
Mom looks at the monitor, at the picture of Lisa Sherman's face
want you to come home with me right now, Jody
Who is she
She's nobody you should be concerned with
Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all
think that concerns me
Don't make me order you
Jody sits back down
You going to drag me out and me in my room until  go to college
Marge sits down next to Jody and takes her hand
If  have to
Please let me protect you
Jody is at a crossroads
Jody doesn't know what to do
Her mother hugs her, puts her arm around her, and almost lifts her out of her seat
She leads her down the stairs, away from the old newspaper
Jody's mom leads her across the vast hallway
They come to the door leading out of the library
Jody stops and looks back
She sees the old spinster Miss Dunlop, stacking the books
Wait
What
(asserting herself) 'm not leaving
want to know why you and dad are so freaked out
Three of my classmates are dead
Mom doesn't like this at all
: beautiful garden on the edge of the library
The autumn wind is blowing
The leaves are at the height of foliage
Jody and her mom are seated on a carved stone bench
Years ago, something horrible happened in this town
When was still in high school
girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors
Attacked how
She was raped
At least that's what she claimed
You didn't believe her
(confessing) No,  believed her
She was in pretty bad shape
Inside and out
But the boys were never formally charged
Why not
They were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team
And she was  a loner
An angry girl that no one really liked
She'd called them 'queers'
People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'
They were proving to her they weren't
They were very drunk
Things were different back then
You think kids are sexually bottled up today
And the police did nothing
How could you
don't know
We just did
guess was kind of scared going against the gain
Against the whole town
The word is Mob
've regretted it ever since
Never run with the herd just because they're the herd
Who were they
Marge freezes
She didn't want to be asked that
Who
The men
Do any of them still live around here
Two men left town right after it happened
You're not telling me something
Marge takes a deep breath, unsure what to say
Mr
Sisler was one of them
(shocked) The principal
Yes
Who was the fourth
Marge is stricken
She looks down
God
It's like everything that was ever repressed in this town is suddenly bubbling up through the ground
Jody gets it
Dad
Her mother can't deny it any longer
(') (horrified) ' why he called Mr
Sisler first
He was one of them
Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened
We both have
Jody gets up
He dedicated his life to law enforcement after
Jody runs off, very upset
Jody jumps on her bicycle and speeds off
Marge sits down and stares straight ahead, crushed
The rusty old mailbox on the forgotten dirt road reads 'Lisa Sherman' Brent's police car turns into the driveway
Brent pulls up to the house
he sits and stares for a moment
' It's a dilapidated old house, uncared for, overgrown, a 'For Sale' sign stands crookedly in the front yard
Brent gets out of the car and heads to the front door, stepping over rusty tools and old auto parts
Brent lifts his hand and is about to knock
He can't
He walks around in a circle, composing himself, preparing himself to face Lisa Sherman after all these years
He draws the gun from his holster and knocks
No one answers
He knocks again
No one answers, again
,  , appears from the side of the house
Hello
'm looking for Lisa Sherman
She's not here
You know where  can find her
St
Michael's
She works at a church
She resides there
Out back
She died a year and a half ago
Brent feels terribly guilty about what he did to Lisa Sherman, but also terribly relieved that he'll never have to face her
It's been a  long time since he's confronted his hidden past
He puts his gun away
Of what
bullet to the right cerebellum
She was murdered
No
She ate a pistol for lunch one day
Brent can't help but feel responsible
Can you describe her
How old was she
never met the woman
'm just taking care of the place until they sell it
Can you get inside
can
knew Lisa Sherman long ago
It's extremely important that get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here
don't give a fuck what your reasons are
You pay me ten dollars, you can go inside Otherwise, get a warrant
He pulls out his wallet
Cut to: ' Jody rides up to Kenny's house
Kenny sees her from his bedroom window
Kenny comes tearing downstairs
Kenny, opens the front door, very excited
Jody
(he kisses her) Yes
You're here
Jody wipes a tear from her eye
Kenny notices how upset she is
(') What's the matter
Jody bursts into tears
She hugs him
He hugs her back and leads her inside
An old rundown house
The clutter smells
Whoever lived here had little to no self respect
Garbage is piled up in every corner, order is nowhere
Brent is repulsed by what he sees
he wasn't expecting such chaos
He knows he helped create this mess
Is there a picture of her somewhere
No pictures
No mirrors
Was she a crazy woman when you knew her
(feeling very guilty) No
Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh
No, you couldn't
've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest
Really
Yeah
You should check downstairs
Why
People always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements
All the weirdness in this house took place in the basement
The woman flips on the basement light
There are several locks on the door
Brent is very scared of what he's going to find down there
Brent steps down into the basement
It is a combination prison/bedroom
It looks like it hasn't been cleaned in years
Water drips for the ceiling
Rat traps are everywhere
Old broken child's  are stacked in one corner below some handcuffs which are bolted into the wall above a cot
The cot is small, the mattress rotted
Old shit lies dried on the floor piss stains line every wall
Huge nails and odd iron objects sit in one corner
Brent walks over to the dresser and looks in it
He pulls out a pair of grown man's trousers
He examines them
They look like they'd fit you
Three bucks
Brent things for a moment then throws the pants down
He darts back up the stairs
The caretaker laughs
' Jody and Kenny are in Kenny's bedroom, sitting on his bed
All our parents are weirdoes
think my dad is into hookers
know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid
(all wound up) My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist
(compassionately) think this is a big part of growing up
It's losing your spiritual virginity
It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were
They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends
can't believe  listened to one word of his shit
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody
So  should feel happy that he got away with it
don't know
kind of am
Jody, still crying, stares at Kenny for a second then leans in and kisses him with everything she's got, Ready for action
Are you coming to the party
Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now
Jody quickly takes her own shirt off, rips off his, and pounces on him
He's taken aback by her sudden aggressiveness
He has no idea how to respond to it
Brent comes storming out of the hall of records
Frantic dialing
Brent is on the phone
' The phone rings
The answering machine picks up
(leaving a message) Tom
Lisa Sherman is dead
But you'll never believe what  found out
Meet me at the Roadhouse on Route nine in a half hour
We need to talk in private
As Brent finishes his message the camera moves across the principal's desk, first revealing a few blood drops on a piece of paper and then the killer's hand, holding the razor
The killer has been listening to the message
Tom, the principal, is sitting in the corner in  a large puddle of his own blood, tied to the radiator
He's barely alive
His tongue has been cut out, his foot cut off at the ankle and shoved into his mouth
One eye is missing, the other one has been left in only so that Tom can look into the killer's face as he's tortured
The razor blade is lifted off the table
Tom braces himself, gripping his hands, preparing for more pain
The camera moves back to the phone as we hear Tom gag and then the killer walking out of the room
' Jody is all over Kenny
He's really weirded out by her aggressiveness
She reaches for his crotch and finds that he's soft
She rolls over, embarrassed
(worried) What's wrong
Am  doing something wrong
Just making me feel like a piece of meat
'm making you feel like meat
Yeah
Jody rolls over, a bit pissed off and very confused
You break up with me because won't fuck you
That's not why we broke up
You flaunt some slut in my face
Sharon's far from a slut
And when  finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat
Jody, you're only doing this to get back at your dad
It doesn't have that much to do with me
She gets up angry, and starts putting her clothes back on
That was the wrong note to play
The truth hurts
Please don't go
Please
Stay, We'll just talk
Then go to the party
This party is sick
She heads to the door
Jody
Wait
What
'm scared
Three kids are dead
want to go to this party
Then go to the party
Run with the herd Kenny
Just don't spew out all that 'be an individual, assert yourself' crap anymore
She heads out, very upset
-  condom slides across the counter
The register rings it up
teenage boy is standing there buying the condom
The camera pulls back to reveal another teenage boy behind him, also holding a condom and then another and another
All told, the store is completely jam packed with over a hundred boys, all standing in line, all buying condoms
: Sandy is getting ready to go to the party, making herself look as hot as possible, and she looks hot
There's a knock on the door
She's scared to answer it, considering how she's dressed
Her dad comes in and sits on the bed
Sandy turns away from and buttons her top shirt button up

(concerned) You do
Your brother told us
Daddy
Shh
'm not going to tell you not to go
You're not
No

He places something on her dresser, smiles at her, and leaves
She looks at what he's left
It's a condom
: Carloads of kids head toward Cherry Falls, howling out the windows, guzzling beer
Police cars screech to a stop, barricading the entrances to town, preparing for the onslaught
Brent is driving out of the Indiana town when he sees something out the window
It's
church
Brent pulls over
Lisa Sherman's headstone
It's a modern one
Her picture is on it
It's the same woman as the sketch artist drew
Brent stares at the headstone, alone in the cemetery, feeling ashamed
Lisa, 'm so sorry

Her mom bursts into tears

Purely preventive
Cut to: kid raided his parent's liquor cabinet, pouring five different types of liquor into a pickle jar
Another kid raids his parents weed stash, grabbing a handful of buds
third kid raided his parents medicine cabinet
Lots of barbiturates in this house
- Kids are climbing out their windows, climbing down trees and sheet ropes, trying to get out, sometimes being chased and caught by their parents
One kid is locked in his room, another driven far from town
everyone's grounded but everyone's going to the party any way
Kids from other towns park cars at the edge of town and try to sneak into Cherry falls through the woods
Police try and cut them off
Jody pedals quickly down the street
She's going nowhere
She starts to cry
Brent pulls into the roadhouse to look for Tom Sisler
As he walks inside we notice the killer's Imperial is parked there as well
Brent's in trouble
Mark's car pulls up in front of the party house
Sandy squeezes his arm, excited
Music blares from the house
They all hop out and head up to the bash
All sorts of kids make their way across the front lawn
They are carrying pillows, sheets, blankets, anything and everything that will make the wood floors more comfortable
One couple runs towards the front door howling
Another boy pulls his obviously frightened girlfriend into the house, reassuring her that everything will be fine
Lots of kids are milling around outside because two big football players and their dates are guarding the front door
There's a big sign that says "Couples only"
Lots of hooking up is taking place on the front lawn
' Two computer nerds are hidden behind a tree, watching the other kids arrive
They spot the two homely girls we saw earlier
1 There's Jan and Heather
Let's grab them quick before someone else does
2 Ok
1 Hide your laptop here
2 No
1 You can't bring it
2 'm not leaving it here
Nerd 2 heads toward the girls, taking his laptop
Nerd 1 follows, pissed off
They walk up near the homely girls and make eye contact
After several uncomfortable moments, someone shouts for an upper window
Marisa
Find someone fast
Floor space is almost gone
This only heightens the uncomfortable ness outside
One of the homely girls looks at the laptop
2 Ever play
2 What's that
2 computer game
The four just gravitate toward each other, now 'coupled'
They enter the house next to each other, all four terrified, none even acknowledging yet that they're all in danger
Ben and Cindy arrive
(finalizing) get all your CDs
Not my imports
Ok not your imports
All your other  and your K2 snowboard
That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting
Don't flatter yourself
You'll be lucky to last ten seconds with me Ben
She kisses him passionately, and gets out of the car
He follows her, smitten, like a puppy dog
Kids file through the house, creating floor space, moving furniture, piling it high
keg of beer flows in the corner
Rock n' Roll blares from all directions
Everyone's excited
: Jody rides down the street, just pedaling fast, as fast as she can
She's in her own world, very upset
car comes toward the intersection on the other street but doesn't slow down, knowing the light is about to change
boy in a passing car whistles at Jody, waking her out of her stupor
Jody looks up just as the light turns red
She hits her brakes and skids into the tail of the oncoming car
She glances off it and goes sliding off the road, into a few garbage cans
The car nicks another car and pulls over
Across the street, we see that the Killer's  is stopped at the red light
Jody gets up, shaken
He knees and elbows are badly scratched
The  of the car comes running over to Jody
Are you
'm ok
Are you sure
Yes
(
) You don't look
Jody turns around
Her teacher Leonard Marliston is there
The killer's is parked behind him
Jody wipes away the tears
(starting to cry) am
My house is just a couple of blocks away
Why don't you come on over and clean those cuts up
Ok
Should  put my bike in the back of your car
Can you just follow me
The back is full
Sure
: Kids are still arriving from all over but there's no more room in the house so the party starts spilling out into the backyard
One couple spreads out on the roof
cop car has pulled up in front and the deputy is just keeping a watch on the house
Kids are starting to gather and hook up in the town square
As the police try to break up one gathering, another one starts
: Leonard drives down the road
He smiles into his rear view mirror
In Leonard's rear view mirror we see Jody pedaling behind him
couple of boys lean out of their cars and invite Jody to the go to the party
Sirens scream out in the distance
' Leonard pulls into his driveway
Jody pulls in behind
She leans the bike on the front porch and they head into the house
You aren't going to the party
You know about that too
' Mr
Leonard opens the door to his house
Jody walks in behind him
of
You're not scared
Of course 'm scared
Then you should go
You think  should go to the party, Mr
Marliston
really do
For your own safety
Jody doesn't know what to make of this
It's not what she expected to hear from her teacher
Leonard goes into the kitchen
Jody sits on the couch and looks around
She's immediately sensing that something is off about the place
It's certainly not the way she imagined a teacher's house to look
It has all sorts of city plans, maps, and drawings on the walls
Years of Cherry Falls yearbooks and newspapers are stacked in piles
He reappears with two beers and a pot filled with soapy water
He hands her a beer
just feel so manipulated
By everyone
My dad, my boyfriend, and now some psychopath  don't even know
, surprised he's giving her alcohol
He kneels down in front of her and begins to clean the wound on her leg
We're all manipulated
From the moment we're born
The event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before  was even born
Really
Yes
We have no real freedom
You of all people should understand that
This may sting
Jody is beginning to feel strange
There's something off kilter about this whole encounter
Me
Why me
Because of your father
The way what his sins shaped you
He starts putting a disinfectant on her wound
What do you know about my father
He's a rapist
Like mine
She grimaces
The disinfectant hurts
(a little scared)_ Your father raped someone
Lisa Sherman was my mother
Do you know who that is
Yes
was born nine months after she was raped
One of the four men who raped her is my father
have no idea which one
You're the killed
Yes that's the whole point
This is what  was put on this earth to do
Rape the town that raped my mother
Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers
've planned this since  was a very little boy
You have no real freedom either
Your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded
Jody gets up and starts backing away from him but he gets up quickly
He's not letting her get away
Jody bolts for the door but she doesn't have time to open it
Leonard grabs her and throws her across the room
Jody smashes into a  table
He bends down to pick her up, but she pulls a book case over on him, narrowly escaping
She runs for the back door
Jody opens the back door and gets halfway out when Leonard runs up to her, pulls her away from the door, and slugs her in the face, sending her sprawling to the ground
He picks her up and punches her a second time, breaking her nose, knocking her half out
He picks her up by the waist and carries her to the basement stairs
Leonard throws Jody down into the dark basement
She tumbles down the stairs, hitting her head on the cold stone floor
He comes charging down after her, closing the door behind them
: The  is now skipping
Kids are in every corner, bed , and closet, making out
Every square inch of the house is being taken as the party shifts into higher gear
It's a sea of sheets and blankets rippling with bodies under them
Giggles and moans are heard every second
Sandy and Mark are gently kissing in the closet, still standing up
Mark studies Sandy's face for a second, then slowly lifts her dress, sliding his hand on to her thighs
You're so beautiful
So are you
Now don't be nervous
You're the one who's hand is shaking
Mark smiles, embarrassed
They kiss
They're falling in love
-  beeps come off a computer screen as a warrior armed with a huge plasma gun fights his way into a dark cave, shooting plasma everywhere
The nerds and the homely girls are in the corner playing the computer game,     a move
People around them are shushing them as they blow up monster
One guy finally has had it
gets up, grabs the laptop and tosses it out the window
2
2 Hey
That was a 3k machine
1 Told you to hide it
Homely girl 2 starts to laugh
It was kind of funny
Then they all start to laugh, even  2
There's nothing left to do but laugh
Except kiss
And that they do
Cindy and Ben are naked under a blanket in the corner
One more time
(negotiating) get the imports
Ok
He's all over her
She's into it too
Sharon turns up the heat on Kenny, running her hands across his bare chest
Kenny breaks off the kiss, not really into it
You ok
Just thinking about something
What
There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday
It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught
guess so
Luckily we won't have that problem
She kisses him again
He stops her again, buttons his shirt
What are you doing
got to go
What
'm worried about someone
He puts his clothes on
You can't just leave me here
' Stay put Sharon
'll hop on over when 'm done here
' You will not
Others laugh
Kenny looks around
Jody was right, this party  sick
Kenny buttons his shirt and heads out
Sharon is pissed
: As Jody comes to, she finds herself gagged, tied to a chair in the dark basement
She can't see much but she can hear the sounds of water dripping and a rat scurrying around
She tips her chair over and falls onto the cold floor
She tries to removes her gag by rubbing her head against the ground
' Leonard goes to his station wagon and opens the back
body is hidden under a blanket
Leonard picks it up
It's too heavy
Jody can't undo her gag but she notices a piece of glass under a dresser
She turns herself around to grab for it
She squeezes her hand under the dresser, reaching for the shard
The door at the top of the stairs opens
Leonard appears in silhouette carrying the body wrapped in a blanket
He throws it down the stairs and turns the lights on
The basement is almost an exact replication of the basement in his mother's house
cot in the same spot
The dresser as well
The Lisa Sherman costume is neatly hung from big metal hooks
Leonard sits Jody back up
little blood drips from Jody's closed hands
She has the shard
Leonard ties the other body to a chair facing Jody
He starts singing (singing) 'It's a family affair, It's a family affair
' He undoes the blanket revealing the battered but still breathing body of Jody's dad
Brent's bleeding from the forehead, nose, and mouth
He's badly beaten up
Jody gags on her gag
Her dad looks her in the eye
Well, we may be family One in four chance
Leonard picks up his razor and starts towards Jody
Sheriff Brent, you will be the second of the four horsemen of the apocalypse to die
But first you will watch as  slice up your little girl
Brent starts frantically shaking no, trying to escape as Leonard kneels in front of Jody and runs his hands up under her dress, exposing her shaved, nubile leg
The '' is still fresh in her calf
Leonard starts to cut an '' next to it
Jody's face grimaces in pain
Blood drips to the ground
Her leg starts to shake
You're shaking too much
If you don't stop shaking Jody, 'll have to kill before  carve
We wouldn't want that
Jody concentrates on trying to show no pain, not to flinch
It's tough
Her father watches, horrified
Cut to: Kenny runs down the street, heading toward Jody's house
He stops to catch his breath for a second
He notices something
' Jody's bicycle is still leaning against Leonard's porch
Kenny crosses the street to Leonard's house and inspects the bicycle
It's hers
Leonard continues to work on Jody's bare leg, starting the ''
Jody and her father stare at each other, helplessly
My mother said, after you and your three droogs raped her Brent, that people in town refused to let her use their bathrooms
Is that true
Did people really call her a slut and tell her 'you can't shit here'
She used to snarl that at me
That's all she really did, at least in my direction, was snarl
When she looked at me, she saw only you
Jody gags in pain
Brent looks away
Open your eyes Brent
Watch
Or will  cause her much more pain
Brent opens his eyes
More blood drips
Jody starts to lose consciousness, barely able to stand it anymore
The doorbell rings
Leonard looks up, concerned
Kenny rings it again
No one answers
He walks over to the window and looks through a crack underneath the curtains
Kenny's  - Jody's coat and purse are still on the couch
Kenny senses that something is really off
He rings again but no one answers
Worried, he pops the screen
It's breaking and entering time
Kenny climbs into the living room and looks around
Hello
Jody
Leonard hears Kenny
He can't ignore him any longer
Who the fuck is breaking into my house
Leonard checks Jody's and Brent's ropes are tight, then heads up the stairs
As soon as he disappears, Jody wriggles toward her father and starts cutting his ropes with the shard of glass
Leonard comes out of the basement and peers into the living room
Leonard sees Kenny opening Jody's purse, checking it out
Leonard keeps the razor hidden behind his back
My wallet's on the mantle when you've finished your rifling, Kenny
Kenny looks up, startled
(nervously) Oh, hey Mr
Marliston
-What's Jody's bike doing on your front porch
That all depends Kenny
Depends on why the  you've broken into your history teacher's house
Alright, Marliston,  know she's here
What are you talking about
No one here but us chickens
Jody cuts through her dad's ropes
Her dad immediately takes Jody's gag off
Kenny heads out the door
(
) Help
Kenny hears the cry and turns around
That was Jody
Leonard says nothing
He just stares at Kenny
(
) Somebody help
Kenny heads toward the basement door to investigate
Brent starts kicking on the other side of the locked door
Jody
Leonard moves towards Kenny with the razor
Kenny turns just in time
He grabs Leonard's arm as Leonard tries to slit his throat
They struggle
The door lock starts to shake as Brent continues to kick the door open from the other side
Leonard picks up a  lamp with his free hand and smashes Kenny across the head
Kenny falls to the ground
The door pops open
Brent charges out
Leonard turns to him and slashes him across the chest as Brent sprays red paint in Leonard's eyes
Leonard screams, and lunges at Brent
Brent grabs Leonard
Using every ounce of energy he has, he throws Leonard down the basement stairs
Leonard grabs Brent as he tumbles down the stairs
The two roll to the bottom, smashing their heads along the way
As they come to a stop, Brent smashes his head hard on the floor
Leonard ends up on top of him
He raises the razor and slits Brent across the face
Jody run
Jody crawls up the stairs, dragging her bad leg
Instinctually, Brent hangs on to Leonard, as Leonard tries to get to Jody
Leonard slashes Brent across the face again
No
(dying) Run
Jody crawls to the top of the stairs
Leonard does everything he can to get away from Brent but Brent hangs on
Jody watches, horrified, at the top of the stair
Kenny appears at the top of the stairs and pulls Jody away from the gruesome sight as Leonard continues to slash Brent's body open
Brent rolls over, a bloody mess
Kenny slams the door shut as Leonard charges up the stairs
Kenny holds the door shut with all his might
My dad's down there
He's dead
We've got to get the fuck out of here
Kenny pushes a dresser in front of it, trapping Leonard
can't walk
think he cut right through a tendon
Leonard starts chopping through the door with an axe
Kenny helps Jody out the front door
Jody and Kenny limp out of the house
Kenny grabs Jody's bike
Climb on
Leonard breaks through the door
Leonard runs into the kitchen and looks out the window
Kenny and Jody are peddling away down the driveway
Leonard bursts out of the house and jumps into his car
Leonard starts the car
The car squeals out of the driveway, rims sparking wildly
Kenny frantically pedals the bike up the pristine suburban street
Jody hangs on for dear life
Go to the police station
Deputy Webber's at the party
It's only three blocks away
Leonard's car squeals around the corner behind them
Fuck
It's him
Leonard steps on the gas
Kenny peddles as fast as he can, going up onto the sidewalk but that doesn't stop Leonard
He comes screeching up on the sidewalk right behind Kenny, ready to run him over
Kenny tears up onto a lawn, Leonard follows him, grass spewing up everywhere
Kenny cuts hard between two trees and back onto the street
He heads onto the other sidewalk
remains in pursuit, knocking into several cars, flattening several fences, and mutilating a cat along the way
Leonard gains on them as they zigzag up and down the pristine street, destroying it
Leonard pulls up right behind them
He hits the gas
Kenny has to turn hard to avoid getting hit
Kenny can't hold the bike upright and it slides out from under them
Kenny and Jody tumble up someone's driveway, smashing into their fence
Leonard can't hold the car straight and it 360s across several lawns
Finally stopping, smashing into a parked car
Kenny helps Jody to her feet
The   that lives in the house comes charging out of the dog door towards them, barking and snarling
Shit
Kenny helps Jody over the fence, then leaps up on it just as the German Shepard snaps at him
He jumps down on the other side, safe
The German Shepard smells something else and tears away
Leonard gets out of his car and takes a step toward the house when the German Shepard comes charging out the open fence
Leonard screams
The dog pounces on him, starts humping his leg
Leonard rolls his eyes
The dog thrusts away
Leonard raises the razor, contemplates, then rolls his eyes
He pushes the dog off of him
It lets out a panted growl, almost like it's saying 'going so soon lover boy
' Leonard hops back in his car, speeds off down the street
The dog barks wildly up at the night sky
Talk about being left with a hard-on
The house is dark
The lights are all out
The deputy checks his watch
policeman comes running up
We just found another body
Who's
Tom Sisler
He was murdered at school
Two kids went into his office to fuck and they found him, with his tongue cut out and his foot jammed into his mouth
Killer also chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his pencil holder
Jesus
Any word from Brent
Nope
The switchboard is lightning up downtown
Kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks and at the high school
It's turning into  except there's no concert
Call Brent on the horn
See where he is
What he wants us to do
'll head over to the school
Ok
The deputy jumps into his car
Don't leave this party until you hear from me
The policeman looks up at the house
But  shouldn't shut it down
No
Hell, it's the quietest goddamn party 've ever seen
Jody and Kenny climb over a fence into another backyard
Jody is limping badly
Kenny is helping her along
Thanks for coming back for me
love you
She kisses him
He kisses her back
Leonard has pulled over down the street from the party
Kenny and Jody appear from a backyard, across the street from the party
The officer sits in his car, trying to call Brent
Brent
(no answer) Come in Brent
There's a knock at the car window
The officer looks up, startled
Leonard is looking in the window
The officer rolls down the window
Jesus Christ had balls in his soup, Marliston, what'd you do, eat out a pizza or something
What the fuck happened to your face
Hey, look, Elvis
Where
You really are a god damn rube
Leonard slashes the officer's throat open in one savage swoop
He slumps over the steering wheel, throat cut beyond repair, blood squirting everywhere
(humming) 'Family affair
Oh yes it's a family affair'
Jody and Kenny limp up to the party
There are no police outside
Where are the police
Jody looks down the road, lets out a blood curdling scream
is slowly limping towards the house, gore dripping razor in hands
Oh  '
Quick
In the house
He won't look for us in there
Kenny and Jody limp toward the front door
Kenny and Jody limp through the front door
Couples are everywhere
There's no room to even walk
The party has reached it's 'climax'
We see the faces of teenage boys and girls as they lose their virginity
They run the gamut of emotions
Some are terrified, some are ecstatic
Some are concentrating as hard as they've ever concentrated, some are closing their eyes, trying to fade out
We see Sandy, Mark, Cindy, and Ben all having a blast
Sharon has managed to find a new partner and the nerds are riding the homely girls
It's orgiastic
Kenny and Jody can only marvel at it as they limp through the maze of bodies looking for a place to hide
a sheet off the ground and carries Jody up the stairs
Kenny carries Jody into the huge bedroom
couple of kids look up as the door opens
There must be over a 100 teenagers in the room, adjoining bathroom, and closets
The room is just a sea of kids humping two deep, under blankets
There's no room in here
Yeah
Get lost we're packed
Kenny pays no attention to them
He shoves his way into a corner,  pissing off everyone on the way, stepping on a few hands and other appendages
He puts Jody down and starts unbuttoning her shirt
(whispering) What are you doing
Pretend we're just another couple
He pulls her under the sheet
- Leonard comes in the front door, his razor in hand, the policeman's blood still dripping from it
He looks around, wondering if they're here
No one seems to notice Leonard as he hunts for Jody and Kenny, walking through the sea of bodies, dripping blood on the backs of a couple of kids
serial killer at a fuckfest
Leonard smiles at the sight of all the teenagers copulating
Kenny and Jody curl up next to each other
Kenny kisses her
She kisses him back
They're into each other
They can't keep their hands off each other
They start to really make out
Leonard moves into one of the bedrooms
He switches the lights on
The kids look up pissed off
There's not an inch of floor space
Hey
Turn that off
Mr
Marliston
Hi Samantha
Excuse me
He steps over a thrusting hairy ass, surveys the room
No Kenny
No Jody
(freaked) What are you doing here
The girl breaks into orgasm before she can barely finish the sentence
Leonard flips the lights off and heads out of the room
Through out the entire proceedings, everyone was fucking like no one entered the room
Homeostasis remains stable
Leonard heads up the stairs, still looking for Kenny and Jody
couple of kids on the staircase notice him
He almost trips on one
They start whispering to each other, freaked out that a teacher is there
More and more kids start looking up The party has definitely been disturbed
Jody hears the disturbance
She stops Kenny and listens
Leonard checks another bedroom
He flips the lights on
No Jody, no Kenny
He leaves
More and more kids notice him
Jody and Kenny know he's close
Leonard appears in the doorway
(whispering) It's him
Leonard accidentally steps on a boy's hand as he enters the room
The boy, , is pissed off
He looks up and realizes who it is
Pay no attention to me
What are you doing here
He's looking to get laid
' Mr
Marliston
She grabs her clothes, embarrassed
Jimmy gets up
He's very drunk
Kenny and Jody peek out from under their sheet
You fucked me up
What
You gave me a ''
'm sure you should have failed
was grounded for two fucking months because of you
Jody knows her friend is in danger
Jimmy leave him alone
He's imbalanced
Leonard sees Jody
He starts toward her but Jimmy stupidly jumps in his way
Please get out of my way or 'll have to hurt you
knew you were a pervert
Always wearing those fucking doofy glasses, and driving a station wagon
He's dangerous Jimmy
So am
'm gonna rip your cock off Marliston
Touche' Leonard winds back, slashes at Jimmy, lopping off his dick
Blood flies up, splatters across Jimmy's face
Jimmy screams
Leonard slashes open his neck
Blood splatters everywhere, on kid's backs, faces, butts
His girlfriend screams as Jimmy falls to the ground, dying
Leonard begins to panic
So do the kids
Leonard sees Jody across the room and starts toward her as the other kids in the room rise to their feet and stampede the fuck out of dodge like a herd of frightened elephants
Kids in other rooms hear the commotion and break their embraces
(
) Run
Mr
Marliston's here
And he's horny
Panic sweeps through the whole party
Everyone wants out
Leonard can't get to Jody because too many kids are trying to get out the bedroom door, pushing toward it, sweeping him up in their flow
It has turned quickly into chaos with a teenage logjam at the door
Leonard keeps his eyes pinned on Jody across the room, through the bodies
He can't make headway so he raises the razor to slash way to her
Jody sees him raise the razor
No
Leonard starts slashing his way toward Jody
He slashes a girl across the stomach, a boy across the face, a  girl across the breasts
It's a bloodbath, everyone's screaming
' bodies fall to the ground, tripping people, creating even more chaos
Leonard loses his balance and is pushed to the ground as kids stampede over him
Jody and Kenny try to make it to the door
Leonard tries to get up but he can't
He starts crawling toward Jody, slashing the legs of a couple of kids who are in his way, sending them to the ground
One kid does a back flip through a glass coffee table, exploding it, sending a shard of glass out his throat
Blood sprays across the ceiling like a lawn sprinkler
Through the sea of legs, Leonard sees Jody's leg, the '' still freshly carved
He slashes his way towards Jody
Half naked kids come streaming out of the house, it's a bizarre sight
Some of them stop and scream, noticing the deputy (his body has been hung upside down from a telephone pole, and disemboweled)
The house is almost bursting as kids climb out the windows and appear from the back
Too many kids are trying to get out at one
The staircase and all the hallways start totally backed up but all the kids keep pushing forward
Something's got to give
Leonard keeps crawling toward Jody, getting closer and closer
He scrunches over Jimmy's severed penis, staining his khakis with gore
Come on
These are eighty dollar khakis
Limited Edition
God damn it
The pushing continues
There's nowhere to go
boy gets pushed over the balcony, falling to the ground below
Leonard is just a few feet from Jody's leg
Jody and Kenny push closer to the door
Leonard reaches for Jody's leg
He can't quite grab it
Kenny and Jody reach the door
They're almost out
Leonard lungs and grabs Jody's leg
Jody screams out in pain, falls into the crowd
Kenny
Kenny tries to grab for her but he can't reach her
The force of the mob pushes him out the door, through the vortex
Kids jam the staircase
There's too many trying to get down at once
Everyone's still pushing
The kids on the staircase can't keep their position and start falling forward, pushing harder
Leonard keeps hold of Jody's leg and pulls her toward him
Kenny tries to get back to Jody but there's no way he can make headway back into that room
Jody
The staircase is now jammed with people, starts to buckle
The banister breaks
Kids start falling off the balcony and staircase, onto kids below,  , breaking bones
Lamps smash to the ground
Tables are trampled
Basically, the entire inside of the house is destroyed in the stampede which puts something out of fucking  to shame
Leonard gets hold of Jody's waist and pulls her towards him, razor ready
Everyone gives one final push out
Kenny is swept on to the staircase
It can't take the pressure and finally cracks
Kids tumble on top of each other falling to the floor below as the staircase splinters
Hurt kids are everywhere as more and more get pushed over the edge
It's a disaster
Broken boned teenagers litter the floor like it were a battlefield
Kenny manages to grab hold of the second floor as kids fall past him
The whole house begins to buckle
The room empties as the kids push out
Leonard pulls Jody up next to him and puts the razor to her neck
He draws the first spot of blood
Please
You wouldn't kill your sister, would you
You think you're my sister
Kenny manages to pull himself back up to the second floor
Jody turns to look at  as Kenny appears in the doorway
We have the same color eyes
He looks into her eyes
You're right
We do
Leonard stares at Jody for a moment, relaxing his grip, giving Kenny just the break he needs to dive for Leonard's arm, surprising him, knocking him over
They struggle for the razor but Leonard overpowers him and grabs it, cutting his own hand
He turns and slices Kenny down the side, cutting him deep
Kenny fights off the pain and leaps on Leonard's back, grabbing his arm around the neck
Leonard stands up and twirls around, trying to knock Kenny off his back, smashing him into walls
Kenny screams in pain, but doesn't let go, pulling at Leonard's face and throat
Leonard spins faster
struggles to her feet, holding her neck, still losing a little blood
Kenny's grips start to slip as Leonard reaches back, to slice him across the face and neck
, backs up towards the window, slips over a dildo
He screams, loses his grip on Kenny, goes crashing out the second story window
Leonard crashes to the ground below, landing on his back on the front steps
Jody looks out after him
He looks up to her
Their eyes meet
start circling Leonard
Leonard gets to his knees, still holding the razor
They start taunting him
1 It's the freak
The kids inch closer to Leonard
1 He's still got the blade
One kid kicks him
Leonard slashes at the kid, but misses
Another boy kicks the knife out of his hands
third picks it up
3 Come on
It's fuck him up time
One boy kicks Leonard in the face
Another kicks him in the ribs, another in the balls
Leonard tries to fight back for a second but slowly they all descend on him, taking turns kicking and beating the ever living shit out of him
It's a feeding frenzy
He disappears under the angry mob of teenagers
Jody helps Kenny to his feet
Come on
Lets get out of here
Police cars screech to a stop out front
The kids are all disappearing off down the street
emerge out the front door, look down at , barely alive, lying at bloody mess at the base of the steps
-Jody
-please help me
Please
Leonard spits up blood
Jody squeals
Kenny covers her eyes
on the  overhead
The railing breaks off and the balcony comes crashing down, falling on Leonard, killing him
Jody embraces Kenny tightly
It's all over now
dissolve to: Cemetery- Brent's coffin is in a grave
People are leaving the funeral
Jody is with her Mom
They are the last ones there
They watch as the workers start to throw dirt on the coffin
Jody takes her mom's hand in her own
They're close again
Dissolve to: '  - It's night
Jody is asleep
Someone is in the shadows outside, climbing up to her bedroom window
Intruder's  - Through the window, Jody is sound asleep in her bed, vulnerable
The window opens
Someone steps in and moves quietly over to the edge of the bed
She wakes, startled
She looks up
'
(smiling) 'm all out of patience
He climbs in her bed and takes her
She lets him
She's into it
pair of eyes peer through the slates of Jody's closet door
Someone is hidden in her closet
'  - Jody and Kenny are now in the middle of making love for the first time
It's getting hot
Oh God, this is the way it should be
The closet door opens
The real   is there
Maybe she wasn't dead after all
She starts toward Jody, raising a huge butcher knife over her head
Jody sees her and screams
The knife comes down toward the center of Kenny's back
His face contorts as the knife enters his body
Jody screams as he coughs up blood all over her breasts
He looks helplessly at Jody, dying as the knife comes down again
But now it's her father who's doing the stabbing
' Jody wakes up from her dream, startled and shaken
She looks next to herself in bed
Kenny is lying there asleep, smiling, probably dreaming of her
The window is open
He must have climbed in
There is a little red spot on the sheet next to her
She cuddles up next to him as the sun starts to rise outside
Dissolve to: The entrance to the town
The hanging sign reads 'Entering Cherry Falls, Ohio'
The beautiful town is now peaceful again
The crickets are chirping, the robins begin cooing
Suddenly a window comes up and the hanging sign begins to sway back and forth, almost on its own
