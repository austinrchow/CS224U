She's a plain-faced girl with a haunted expression
As she stares out the window, she winds colored yarn around a pair of Popsicle sticks to create a "god's eye
" Out a single window, we see an imposing nine-foot Next to Needy, we see a pile of unopened mail scattered casually on the floor
There are letters, packages, even creepy little gifts and totems sent by admiring "fans
" Every day,  get letters
think get more letters than Santa Claus, Zac Efron and Dr
Phil combined
'm kind of the shit
, a counselor raps on the door and sticks his head in cautiously
Rec time in five minutes, Needy
Grassy-ass, Raymundo
Needy stands up and begins changing into an institutional gym uniform
As she slips off her pajamas, we can see a series of puffy, slash-like  on her body
Sometimes the letters are from people who say they're praying for me
They tell me everything will be okay if  just accept Jesus Christ into my heart
say the words, but nothing ever happens
Nobody comes back
Nobody gets off the cross
She glances sadly at a     on her dresser
She touches the frame wistfully, her eyes full of remorse

They think they can take me away from all this

: (') Like 'd really date some perverted Chester with a hard-on for jailbait
might be insane, but 'm not desperate
We see a morbid "hall of fame" of creepy photos sent in from guys
They line the mirror, grinning at us
There's even a   tucked in there
Needy pulls on her threadbare uniform -shirt
It hangs down to her knees, covering her shorts
(') lot of people ask me if 'm sorry  did it
Needy picks up a paper cup of   on her dresser, dumps the meds into her mouth, and dry-swallows them
() 'm sorry  didn't do it sooner
She saunters out of the room in her   and - Several badminton courts are set up in the gym
As an intense   plays over the public address system, the   enthusiastically--almost violently--whack at the flying shuttlecocks
The patients appear to be varying levels of crazy grins as she dives with her racket, clipping her partner in the leg
In the corner, one forlorn patient nurses her injured arm while another hurls her racket against the wall again and again
Counselors look on approvingly, despite how miserable their charges appear
In the background, a few sulking patients jump rope
Needy enters the gym unnoticed, padding along in her bunny slippers
Welcome to the Mental Olympics
They're big on recreation here
Supposedly it helps us vent our aggressions
We've traded in our hatchets for rackets, our Drain- bombs for double dutch

: (') Even the cutters get in on the action when they're fully conscious
We see a  swinging a jump rope who has a ladder of fresh bandages on her arms and legs
(') Me
'm just trying to stay invisible
Nelly shuffles over to a tetherball and takes a furious at it
- The freshly showered  assemble for breakfast
They grab trays and settle into noisy cliques
Needy selects a single toaster pastry from the breakfast line and sits down, alone
Personally,  think they're trying to wear us out
Keep us sluggish so there won't be an uprising
Well, those
tactics won't work against me
'm a kicker

It even says so on my chart
We briefly cut to Needy's chart, on some doctor's clipboard
We see her name:  ""  and a few brief details about    and Beneath that, we see a triple-highlighted warning in bright ink:
with a clipboard approaches Needy casually and eyes her breakfast plate
Just one Toastem, huh
() like Toastems
That's good
But 'm not sure a Toastem can provide you with sufficient energy for your day
'd recommend more complex carbohydrates

: Needy scrambles to her feet and delivers a sudden, powerful   to the nutritionist's face
' The nutritionist is    -- as if she's been kicked by a far mightier creature than Needy-- and collapses, clutching her bleeding nose
We see that the bone has
The patients shriek
Chaos
As Needy is restrained by staff members, she thrashes like a trapped fish
Needy snorts up a killer  and hocks it at the prone nutritionist
The glob nails her in the eye
It takes four   to haul Needy away as she hollers in protest
The nutritionist curls up on the floor, cupping her bleeding nose as a ring of curious patients surrounds her
She spits out a
" " - Needy is tossed into seclusion
Her hair is wild and her face is wet with tears
The heavy door slams behind her, leaving only a shaft of light
wasn't always this cracked used to be normal-- well, as normal as any girl under the influence of teenage hormones
But after the killings began, started to feel,  don't know
loose around the edges or something
was coming undone like those jeans  made in Home Ec
Falling to pieces like Patsy Cline
Shredded like moo-shu pork
Dead inside
Needy cringes as she briefly hallucinates abstract in the darkness
Grinning skulls
Faces drained of life, half eaten
Grimaces of terror
Suddenly, soft music   is piped into "the hole," ostensibly to calm the patients   in solitary
Needy shudders and recoils at the sound   of it
It's a that we'll soon hear   again
() 5
: "Through the trees,  will find you
Heal the ruins left inside you
And the stars will remind you, we'll meet again
" God,  hate this fucking song
Needy plugs her ears as if it physically hurts her to listen to the song
She curls up in the corner and steels herself for solitary confinement
: : ' ,  -  ( ) Devil's Kettle is a quiet farming community, surrounded by dense woods and mirrored lakes
It's the kind of town that has one high school, one pizza joint, and one stoplight
On an overgrown rural route we see a rustic sign that reads "  ' - Pop
7,036
Come See What's Cookin'
" This is where it all went down
"Devil's Kettle" sounds twisted, know, but the place just is named after a dumb waterfall
-  ( ) We see the titular falls, surprisingly powerful, gushing over a rock face
Well technically, it's two waterfalls
One of them is normal-- it empties into a river basin
But the other one goes into a hole
And it doesn't come out
The scientist guys can't explain it
They've dropped all kinds of things down there--bouncy balls, red dye, radioactive slime-- but nothing ever surfaces

: (') Maybe it's another dimension
Or, you know, just really deep
'  ( ) - The sprawling ranch house is dark from the outside except for a single   -- Jennifer's-- still illuminated
There's a chicken coop and a wire livestock pen in the backyard
We're definitely in deep north country
've probably spent years of my life in this house
Hundreds of sleepovers, thousands of aimless homework sessions, a million phone calls
've climbed through Jennifer's window so many times
But tonight, only one of us is going to come out
'  - lies on her bed, fidgeting as she watches She's a girl of 16 with ,   and a thin, frail body
Her features are gorgeous, but she looks sick and haggard
She picks at her skin with yellowed, Nosferatu-like fingernails and chews idly on a limp lock of hair
Jennifer wears a tight -shirt that says and underwear
An `80s   flickers on the
Jennifer half- watches, distracted
Jennifer didn't always look this rough
Actually, she was the prettiest girl in Devil's Kettle when she wasn't so
hungry
Some recent photos on a corkboard reveal that Jennifer was indeed
(') She hadn't fed in weeks
Jennifer rolls over and glances at the window briefly
We see the  of the house again
It's dark and silent, but for the nearly inaudible snapping of twigs
() 7
: Jennifer turns her attention back to the
Suddenly, we see '  pop up against the window, white and startling
Before Jennifer notices, the face disappears
Outside the house, the bushes rustle
Needy is crouched below the window
We hear the pulsing of her  as if via ultrasound
It's a wet, rhythmic sound: Sploish, sploish, sploish
Inside, Jennifer stretches and shuts off the
She turns out the light
beat of silence
Then, the sound of cracking near the window
Huh
Needy  through the window, screaming and brandishing a
She takes a  at Jennifer's head, but misses and     , specifically in Jennifer's Fall Out Boy poster
Needy throws herself on top of Jennifer
She Jennifer and grips her throat, throttling her
You'll throw me a bone, huh
Huh
You killed Chip
You goddamned monster
You
Jennifer struggles to fight off Needy in the darkness
Her clawlike fingernails rake Needy's back and arms
Needy pulls a   out of her waistband and flicks it open like a switchblade
Kshink
() Do you buy all your murder weapons at Home Depot
God, you're butch
Know what this is for
Cutting boxes
She takes a swipe at Jennifer's
Jennifer instinctively  herself and rears up in defense
We see Jennifer's mouth come down on Needy's neck
Needy shrieks as if , but continues to strangle Jennifer, straddling her and bearing down
() 8
: (2) Jennifer's -shirt slides up to her armpits, exposing her breasts
For a moment, her eyes meet Needy's and she grins
It's as if she has control over Needy for a split second, sexual control
Needy recoils and  Jennifer's body left and right with the box-cutter, marking a gory, oozing "" on her torso
(') () Jennifer gasps, staring at her wounds in shock and disbelief
She looks back up at Needy
beat of silence
Suddenly,  ' They wrestle in a bloody, screaming airborne heap, their figures entwined
Their bodies , collapsing back onto the bed with a thud
Needy raises the box-cutter and plunges it into Jennifer's
Blood  from the wound
() My tit
Suddenly, the room is flooded with  , revealing a Needy straddling Jennifer's
Jennifer's breathing is a raspy death rattle
, a middle-aged woman in bad sleepwear and a worse perm rushes into the bedroom
Jennifer
What is it, baby
Oh my God
Oh my God
She pulls Needy off her daughter
Jennifer rolls over, gasping and bleeding
(') () Needy
Needy drops the boxcutter
It lands on Jennifer's copy of Flag Team Quarterly, splashing the model with fresh gore
Is she dead, Mrs
Check
Did  get her

: (3) Mrs
Check cradles her maimed daughter on the floor like a white-trash Pieta
Jennifer takes one last breath, vomits blood, and

'  - Three police cars squeal up to the curb with sirens and lights engaged
, 22, a muscular young , jogs authoritatively toward the house
He shakes his head, dumbfounded
Christ, Needy, what have you done
- Needy, innocent-looking in , is hustled into the back of the squad car
Her clothes and face are smeared with blood
Officer Duda starts the ignition
His partner, a hard- faced  , slides into the front seat
Her cap is pushed back to accommodate a huge round pouf of shellacked
Hi, Roman
How's the Force treating you
like that jaunty cap
Blue like your balls
How could you do this, Needy
() You killed Jen-- Jennifer-- mean, the victim
Are you on something
Everything's going to be okay now
rule
Shut your mouth back there
Hey
Didn't you used to baby-sit me in like 1998
When my mom worked the overnight at Hormel
The female cop fidgets uncomfortably
() 10
: (') Yeah
Gracie, right
Gracie really like your hair, Gracie
How many cans of Salon Selectives did it take to erect that monument
The cop reaches into the backseat and  Needy, who hiccups with laughter
(') Watch it, Puffy Combs
That's police brutality
You're one to talk about brutality, Ms
Lesnicki
You're looking at attempted murder
Ugh, don't say attempted
That sounds so
Small time
Teeny- weeny, just like Officer Duda up there
And trust me-- 'd know
Roman swallows nervously, eyes on the road
Officer Warzak glances at him
(') Let's get our facts straight: successfully committed a hard core, fully premeditated murder back there
fucking destroyed that brat,
, Needy Lesnicki, put a stop-payment on Jennifer Check
She slumps down in the backseat
(') Why am  even in these cuffs just saved every guy in this town from becoming Satan Chow
'm a hero
She's delirious
() This is going to be a circus
() 11
: (2) At least we've already got a confession
Confessions are for pussies
You've got a declaration, Grace
She giggles maniacally
Roman turns on the radio, violating protocol
It's a soaring rock anthem-- the   we heard being piped into solitary confinement
Both cops  when they hear the song
Roman cranks the volume
God,  love this song
know
And they've done so much for this town
They're way more than a band, really
They're heroes
Wait, this is my favorite part
Roman and the female cop begin to sing along with the uplifting, corny song: (in unison) "Through the trees,  will find you
Heal the ruins left inside you
And the stars will remind you, that you are home
" Needy stares out the window at the sun creeping up over the forest on the horizon
So  killed her
Whatever
It won't undo anything
Three pulses-- three lives-- all stopped cold by adolescent bloodlust
It's hard to believe that just two months ago, me, Jennifer and my boyfriend Chip were completely normal people
() () 12
: (3) (') We were our yearbook pictures
Nothing more, nothing less
We see a brief montage of black-and-white yearbook stills:  executing the splits on a football field, her smile bright
inspecting a school newspaper layout, pen in hand, glasses on her nose
And finally,  , playing a strap-on snare drum at a school pep rally, his head bent in concentration
(') Jesus, Chip
The photo fades into the pep rally itself
is animated, drumming in full color
- drums on the sidelines of the Devil's Kettle High basketball court
The stands are packed with for a pep rally
Chip is 16, clean cut, and an awful drummer
Chip couldn't drum for shit
He only knew "Land of a Thousand Dances" and the solo from "Wipeout
" Lucky for him, the pep band gig wasn't too demanding
Sure enough, the band is playing "Land of a Thousand Dances
" Nearby, the   claps with gloved hands, picking up their flags for a choreographed stunt
Jennifer steps forward in her flag team uniform, breathtakingly beautiful
She hoists her flag aloft, twirling it
Time  as the flag unfurls
(') If you can believe it, that's Jennifer
Yeah, the same girl iced with the box-cutter
Only back then, we were tight
Sisters, practically
People found it hard to believe that a babe like Jennifer would associate with a dork like me
But we'd been the Wonder Twins since we were practically preverbal
Sandbox love never dies
Jennifer finishes her maneuver and  to the stands
Needy waves back at her excitedly from the bleachers, small and owlish with glasses and lank hair
() 13
: , a similarly geeky-looking girl standing next to Needy, rolls her eyes at this display of affection
You're totally lesbigay
What
She's my best friend
The geeky girl mockingly imitates Needy's excited wave
You stare at her like you want to dry hump her
Needy ignores her
(') Like, hump her through pants
() Are you jealous
Of what
That rich bitch
She's not rich
- Needy digs through her locker, carefully selecting textbooks to take home
Jennifer skips up to her, smiling
Hey, Monistat
What's up, Vagisil
You and me are going out tonight
She checks herself out in Needy's locker mirror
Tonight
Why
Soft Shoulder are playing at the Carousel
() () 14
: (') And it's all-ages, for once, which means  won't have to play Hello Titty with the door guy
What's Soft Shoulder
They're this indie band from the city
saw their MySpace and the singer is extra salty
And there will be lots of other salty morsels there for you
Come on Needy, it's the weekend
It's Thursday
Thursday counts as the weekend in college
And we're going to be in college twenty-three months from now
University of Northern Minnesota Duluth- woo
Needy continues loading her backpack
(') Please, please you're a social disease
have to study
Jennifer pouts
With an outstretched finger, she draws a dramatic  in the air over Needy and boos loudly
() Boo
Cross out Needy
Needy blushes, shrinking self-consciously
She obviously hates to displease Jennifer
Fine
What time is the show
'll pick you up at 8:30
My mom has a date with that guy who owns the ham store
He seems nice
() 15
: (2) () Yeah, Mom says he's got a huge
heart
So huge he gave her a recurring bladder infection
Wear something cool, okay
Okay
'  - 8:45
Needy is standing in a small, dingy bathroom, trying on different configurations of clothing
"Wear something cool" meant something very specific in Jennifer-speak
It meant couldn't look like a nerd, but couldn't upstage her either could expose my stomach, but never cleavage
Tits were her trademark
Needy wiggles her jeans a bit lower, exposing her childishly round tummy
She walks out of the bathroom into her bedroom, a frilly pink hell complete with canopy bed
is sitting on the bed, looking lost in all that pink
He raises an eyebrow at Needy's abdomen
Those jeans are hella low
can almost see your front butt
Chip, it's a rock show
This is my rock look
can see, like, your womb
Needy sighs and hoists up her pants
(') Why are you blowing me off for some dumb concert, anyway
We were supposed to have Movie Night even rented Orca
It's like Jaws, except with a harmless whale
() 16
: Jennifer needs me
She really wants to go see this band
It's extremely important to her
've never even heard of Soft Shoulder
Which one is Jennifer stalking
The lead singer, of course
Girls like her don't go out with drummers
Thanks a lot
No offense
mean, she'd probably make an exception for a drummer who was also the lead singer
Like Phil Collins
Who's Phil Collins
Forget it
He's seminal, but whatever
Anyway, this singer guy is like 22, so he could get locked up in the state pen if he actually dated her
But Jennifer says he's extra salty, so
Salty
You guys ever going to stop using that secret language
"Salty" means beautiful
Then you must be soy sauce, babe
Needy and  start
unbuckles his belt eagerly even though they've barely begun
Needy stops
() 17
: (2) Jennifer's here
How do you know
Needy shrugs
beat of silence
Then we hear the door swing open
'  floats up from downstairs
(
) Needy, quit tampooning yourself and get down here
That's fucking weird
(straightening her ) 'd better hurry
You always do what Jennifer tells you to do
Needy pulls her  out from beneath her shirt and flashes a heart-shaped "
" charm at Chip
She's my best friend, Chip
Remember
This necklace is no joke
sighs, resigned
They head downstairs
'  ( ) - Jennifer is waiting in the front hallway
She's heavily made-up and dressed in a predictably sexy outfit
She dangles a set of car keys in front of Needy and
() Guess who's got the whip `til 11:30
2003 Chrysler Sebring and it's all mine
Wow
() 18
: You're lucky you get to ride with me to the club in style
She does a sexy little dance in the doorway, then notices (') Oh, hi Chip
Do you like puppies
She grabs her boobs and thrusts her chest outward at him, giggling
Needy watches jealously and think you forgot, like, two buttons
think she remembered two buttons
Jennifer sniffs the air
It smells like Thai food in here
() Have you guys been fucking
You're gross
She shoves Jennifer and they begin wrestling playfully
slumps against the wall, staring awestruck at Jennifer's cleavage
Okay, let's go to the club
The three of them shuffle onto the porch
Needy locks the door
The Carousel is not a club
Eat my ass, Chip
You're just jello `cause you're not invited
'm not jello
That place is gross
Everyone there has a mustache
() 19
: (2) You're totally jello
You're lime green jello and you can't even admit it
The girls scamper toward the car
(calling after them) Stop kidnapping my girlfriend
- is a run-down tavern at the edge of town, the kind with  posters, wobbly chairs and strands of plastic pennants crisscrossing the ceiling
It's a busy night and the bar is teeming with locals
bartender sells a    to a customer and passes it over the bar
Chip was right
The Carousel is definitely not a club
Clubs are for attractive people in populous urban areas
Clubs have DJs and champagne and separate bathrooms for guys and girls
All we have is a broken jukebox, a few domestic taps and the Sticker Toilet
: - We see a lone, nasty-looking  covered in : Needy and Jennifer enter the bar
Every guy in the joint stares at Jennifer, who snaps her "" wristband distastefully
God,  can't wait until 'm old enough to get wasted
Have you ever had peach schnapps
don't think so
() 20
: Peach schnapps are excellent
They even taste good when they come out of your nose mid-puke
teenage guy, , passes by and waves
Hi Jennifer
You look nice
(without enthusiasm) What up, Craig
She elbows Needy and makes a
(') He thinks he's cute enough for me
No wonder he's in retard math
Jennifer pulls out a pack of Camel Wides and lights one awkwardly
Needy notices   , a , standing by himself away from the crowd
Hey, it's Ahmet from India
The foreign exchange guy
He's all by himself
can't believe we traded a cute hockey player for that
He seems okay
He's got that cool elephant statue in his locker
Do you think he's circumcised always wanted to try sea cucumber
Ew
saunters up to Jennifer, swigging a bottle of beer
He snatches the pack of cigarettes away from her
You're smoking dicks now, Jen
What
like the Wides
() 21
: (2) She sticks the fat cigarette between her lips and inhales pointedly
just bet you do
should arrest you for possession under the legal age
Arrest me, pfft
You're not even out of the academy yet, Roman
Two more months and 'm on the force for real
Then 'll be able to cuff you whenever the hell want
He grips her wrist and twists it behind her back
How will  wait that long
She paws Roman's crotch discreetly
Needy winces
Not here, babe
gotta keep my nose clean
() Look, there's the band
group of skinny    are setting up their equipment on a pathetically tiny stage-- it's more like a dais
The   has intense, spooky eyes, nearly obscured by a shock of hair
The locals, mostly good ol' boys, eye the band suspiciously
You can tell they're from the city
Yeah, `cause they look like a bunch of faygos
You would think that
You're such a small-time Gomer
wish we had more guys like that in Devil's Kettle
All stylish and shit
Needy nods dumbly
She stares at the band, awestruck
() 22
: (3) They look so-- so cool
She gazes at the stage, hearing only the whistling rush of
In  , the  unsheathes his Fender Jaguar from its gig bag
He notices her staring and runs the tip of his tongue over his lips
Needy swallows hard
Hey,  think they need two groupies
Come on
It'll be like Almost Famous
'll be Penny Lane and you can be the other girl
She grabs Needy's hand and enthusiastically tries to drag her toward the stage
No
Don't be
, Needy
They're just boys
Morsels
We have all the power, don't you know that
She plants her hands on Needy's
(') These things are like smart bombs
Point `em in the right direction and shit gets real
Needy shrugs free of Jennifer's grasp and follows her reluctantly across the room
The lead singer of Soft Shoulder,  , is already striding forward to meet them at the lip of the stage
His gait is as smooth as his shock of dyed-black hair
(') Hi
Um, we just really wanted to meet you or something
'm Jennifer Check and this is my friend
'm Nikolai Wolf, and this is my band
He reaches down and pumps Jennifer's outstretched hand
() 23
: (4) () Yeah
Soft Shoulder, right
've heard you guys are super, super good at playing your instruments
hope we can live up to such
high praise
Hey, if you don't mind me asking, why did you want to play all the way out here in Devil's Kettle
You live in the city, right
Yeah
But  think it's so important to connect with our fans in rural areas
Plus, the audiences in small towns really appreciate us
Can  show you my appreciation right now
Needy looks at the floor, embarrassed
Jennifer's voice scales up nervously
(') Like, 'll buy you a drink mean, 'll see if  can get you a drink
They make this great 9/11 tribute shooter
It's red, white and blue, but you have to drink it fast or it gets all brownish
() Mmm
Jennifer hurries off toward the bar
Needy moves self-consciously into a nearby corner, not wanting to continue the conversation with Nikolai alone
plugs a Loretta Lynn tune into the jukebox, with a challenging stare at the band
begins two-stepping in front of the stage
Nikolai walks up to the guitar player, , and pulls him aside
Needy pricks up her ears and listens
() 24
: (5) (') Dirk, what about her
(gesturing to Needy) Who, Training Bra Jones
Needy looks offended
No, the hot one
The one who just walked away
She's it, man
She's exactly what we're looking for
You're sure she's
She's a kid
We're in God's country, man
Everyone out here's a fundie bible-banger
Of course she's a virgin
Dirk hesitates
(') Dirk, we didn't haul our asses out to this corn palace for nothing
Fine
Okay
You know,  know 'm not "just the bassist
" 'm a person who happens to play the bass guitar
And  would like some respect
Nikolai is already ignoring him
Needy, alarmed, emerges from her hiding place and discreetly rushes over to the bar where Jennifer is arguing with a jealous-looking Roman
He shakes his head in disgust and leaves the bar
Jennifer walks over holding an ostentatious She laughs when she sees Needy's concerned expression
What
Are you scared of rock stars too
Those guys are rank, Jen
Just forget about it
() 25
: (6) think the singer wants me
Only because he thinks you're a virgin
heard them talking
Yeah, right
'm not even a backdoor-virgin anymore, thanks to Roman
By the way, that hurts couldn't even go to flags the next day
had to stay home and sit on a bag of frozen peas
Oh my God
Well, if Nikolai wants innocent, can do innocent
'll be Little Miss Fucking Sunshine
He's way too old for you
Don't cock-block me, Needy
Piercing  signals the beginning of the set
Nikolai takes the mic and smiles broadly
Good evening, Devil's Lake
Someone in the back shouts "Devil's Kettle
" (') Sorry
Anyway, we're Soft Shoulder
And we just want to make you happy
He  at Jennifer
The band launch into the same intense, soaring song we heard in the   and the
Jennifer's eyes never leave Nikolai's
She's hypnotized, clinging to Needy's arm
Even the locals look charmed
Suddenly, a lick of  appears on the wood paneling next to the stage
Needy is the first to notice
As she watches in horror, the fire is reflected in her glasses
() 26
: (7) The flames quickly climbs up to the ceiling and begin to blaze uncontrollably
People  and scatter
Someone ineffectually tries to throw a pitcher of beer on the fire
Nikolai turns and sees the fire spreading
He and Chas exchange glances
The   pitches his guitar aside and jumps off the stage, and the drummer abandons his kit
Nikolai seems perfectly cool and composed as he watches from the stage
is he smiling
Everyone is trying to get out of the bar at once, causing a stampede
woman's clothes and hair and she falls to her knees
We see a  fall from the roof, nearly killing
Jennifer stands still in a dreamlike state
(to Jennifer) know where to go
Needy grabs Jennifer by the elbow and pulls her into the tiny
Choking on smoke, they climb onto the Sticker Toilet (which now sports a giant sticker on the tank) and boost each other out the Hundreds are still trapped inside, screaming
- Jennifer collapses in Needy's arms, coughing
Needy hugs her fiercely, almost romantically
She cups Jennifer's flushed face and looks into her eyes
() It's so hot, Needy
think 'm on fire
Oh God, 'm burning
You're okay,  promise
You got burned worse when you wore that tin-foil bikini to the beach
Everything's fine
Suddenly, a  clamps onto Jennifer's shoulder
Both girls jump
It's Nikolai, his forehead creased with false concern
Are you girls all right
() 27
: Needy is less than thrilled to see him
We're great
Maybe you should try to find your band
Those guys
They were the first ones out the door
Ran for the van like a bunch of Marys
Frankly, 'm ashamed of them
Needy narrows her eyes suspiciously
Muffled  rise up from the flame-engulfed building
Jennifer covers her ears and cowers, sweat rolling down her face
(') God, it feels like hell out here
Come and hang with us in the van for a while, just until they hose this place down
Okay
okay
She slumps against Nikolai's chest
You're in shock
Here, drink this
You'll feel better
He smoothly retrieves a plastic bottle of from his coat and holds it to Jennifer's lips
She swigs it cooperatively, dribbling down her chin
Needy blinks in disbelief at the coincidence
Aren't you a little freaked out about this
What about all your stuff
It's probably melting, and when you get to the next stop you'll have to do like, a crappy acoustic set
Nobody likes that
We'll be able to afford new gear soon enough
have a feeling we're gonna blow up
() 28
: (2) () want to see your van
'mon Needy, let's go to the van
Why
Why should we
We have the Malibu
Let's just get out of here
We can go to El Ojo and get Northwoods Nachos with extra Badger Sauce
Please
'm starving
Needy, stop it
Just stop it
She defiantly follows Nikolai toward the  , which is parked a suspiciously safe distance from the bar
Needy staggers after them slowly, watching
Behind Needy, the bar
Screams
Flames
Silence
Needy doesn't even look back as she watches Jennifer get into the van
Ash drifts into her hair like snowflakes
Nikolai takes off his shirt as he enters the van, revealing his slick, muscled white torso
watched her get into that van and  knew something awful was going to happen
But for some reason,  felt drawn toward them
Toward him
He was pale and twisted and evil, like this petrified tree  saw when  was a kid
- () We see  , about five years old, staring up at a petrified tree in the darkness, horrified yet compelled
The tree seems to stoop forward, cracking
: Needy's face is fixed in the same haunted expression
Nikolai turns to look at her, his teeth bared in a vicious smile
Needy turns and sprints off in the opposite direction, away from the van and the fire
29
'  - 11:00
Needy stumbles into her bedroom, overwhelmed
Her clothes are smoke damaged and her cheeks are sooty
She grabs her cheap, taped-up cell phone and dials 's number shakily
: '  - Chip's bedroom is pitch black until a cheap cell phone lights up under the covers illuminating his sleeping form, clad only in jockey shorts
() Hey, Niedermeyer
Thank God you're there
hoped you were sleeping with your phone
What's wrong
Jennifer's gone
She ran off with that rock band
And the Carousel burned down
sits bolt upright Like, burned down
To the ground
Is everyone okay
No
think they're mostly dead
Shit
You're okay, right
We went out the bathroom window
Everyone else was trying to use the door
It was like a stampede
The people who fainted got run over and you could hear their bones breaking
() () 30
: (') There was all this screaming and popping, like a million Black Cats all going off at once
And the smell
This is real, right
This isn't just, like, some crazy dream like last time
No
Anyway, it took me like an hour to walk home
But Jennifer's still with those creeps
They had one of those white molester vans with no windows
The back was all blacked out
Who cares about Jennifer and those douchebags with douchebag haircuts
People just burned to death
In our town
The  chimes
() Oh cheese and fries
Someone's here
'm alone, Chip
'm freaked out
Where's your mom
Swing shift
Listen, 'll call you in a minute
Stay awake
() Holla back
Needy hangs up the phone and rushes downstairs
As she passes through the shadowy kitchen, appliances  all around her
The silence is menacing
'  ( ) - Needy opens the door
Nobody there
She slams the door, turns around and
() 31
: Jennifer is standing in the dark hallway, looking ghostly pale and smiling
Her clothes are tattered and stained-- her entire front is soaked in blood
Her makeup is smeared, and her eyes are bruised and sunken like a zombie's
She looks , especially with that ghastly, clownish grin
Um, Jennifer
Jennifer says nothing and continues to smile with blood- tinged teeth
(') What happened
Utter silence
Then a dripping sound
Needy looks down and sees large drops of blood spattering the linoleum
Jennifer continues to smile, staring directly at Needy
(') () -Jen
Jennifer lets out a horrifying banshee , wailing at the top of her lungs
She vomits a torrent of evil- looking black bile all over herself and Needy and staggers wildly down the hallway
The bloody black bile hits the wall, splashing a framed school portrait of Needy
Needy screams and watches in horror as it slides down the wall
The bile has hundred of tiny  sticking out of it, like little porcupine needles, and it appears to move by itself, oozing across the linoleum, creeping into the corners
It's truly revolting
Needy grabs Jennifer blindly and claps a hand over her mouth
Jennifer falls to her knees, her screams turning to jagged, insane laughter
Needy tries to run, but Jennifer grabs her and  her against the wall with superhuman force, pinning her
Jennifer slowly, tantalizingly brushes her face against Needy's hair, her earlobe
Needy doesn't move a muscle
Jennifer's hand slides up Needy's ribcage
She presses her lips against Needy's carotid artery
We hear Needy's blood pumping, swishing
() 32
: (2) () Are you scared
Needy nods
Jennifer parts her lips
Then suddenly, she stops and , pushing Needy to the floor
Jennifer bolts out the front door and takes off running down the street
Needy is motionless for a moment, then stumbles toward the doorway
(screaming after her) Jennifer
But she's long gone
- Moments before the first morning bell
Needy is sitting at her desk in English class, still visibly bruised from her scuffle with Jennifer the night before
She looks like she hasn't slept a wink
The mood is quiet and somber-- kids whisper about the fire and gather in groups
() heard Needy and Jennifer were there and they had to fight their way out with a machete
Look, she's not even moving
It's called Post Traumatic Stress Disorder
Suddenly, a figure steps in front of Needy
It's , looking absolutely gorgeous-- and remarkably unscathed
She smiles brightly at Needy as if nothing happened the night before
Happy Friday
, -bag
You-- you're all right
() 33
: Yeah
Why wouldn't  be
Last night
At my house
You were hurt
You had two black eyes and blood everywhere and
Needy, you're delusional
got a little banged up when you made me go out that window, but 'm fine
() We had to go out that window
The bar was like, engulfed in flames
You do have a tendency to overreact
Remember at Girl Scout camp when you thought there was an earthquake and it was really just two guys with a ghetto blaster
lot of people died, Jennifer
They burned to death, or they choked, or they just got trampled
More than half of the people there didn't make it out
It's like, all over the news
National news
Kids are dead
Parents are dead
Anyone we know
We know everyone
Sucks to be them,  guess
She giggles and reaches for her knockoff designer purse
don't get it
What's wrong with you
Jennifer applies lip gloss and smacks her lips together
What's wrong with you
mean, besides the obvious surface flaws
() 34
: (2) Needy rubs her eyes, stunned
(to herself) There's no way  dreamed it
No way
She looks down at her hands
There's   under her fingernails
Her blood was still under my nails
See, 'd been up all night scrubbing the carnage off the linoleum
'  ( ) -  () We see Needy on her hands and knees in the eerie blue light of dawn, sobbing as she diligently scrubs blood and bile off the floor with a dirty sponge
The black, spiny vomit repulses her, and she gags
She reaches for a Swiffer WetJet mop and pulls the trigger
No solution comes out
She curses, hysterical and sleep-deprived
Work, you
twat
Swiff, darn it
Swiff
Swiff
She collapses in tears on the floor
- (') (softly, to herself) Shoot
Don't talk to yourself
It's one of your more freakish Needy behaviors and it makes us both look like total gaylords
Needy raises her hands desperately to Jennifer, spreading her fingers to display her filthy fingernails
(') Eww, you need a mani bad
You'd better find a Chinese chick to buff your situation
() 35
: , a middle-aged teacher, enters the room
He has a gnarly-looking robotic hand and moves awkwardly
(') () Here comes Handi-Snack
Mr
Wroblewski clears his throat
His voice quavers
'm sure those of you who made it here today have all heard the news
It's a dark day for Devil's Kettle, a day we can never, ever forget
single, stifled sob rises from the class
Needy glances around the room and sees students fighting back tears huge  weeps openly, tears spattering his swimsuit- model decorated notebook
Jennifer smirks, barely able to contain her laughter
(') The administration here has decided that today will be a unstructured day of support and remembrance
We've lost nine precious students-- including Ahmet from India-- several parents, and a teacher, Ms
Parrish
He fights back tears
No way
Parrish ate shit
Needy shushes her, appalled
This tragedy is obviously beyond anything we can measure
More than ever, we need to band together and draw strength from each other
Mr
Wroblewski painstakingly retrieves a tissue from his pocket with his robotic hand and dabs at his face
(') (his voice cracking) We can rise up
We can overcome death
Needy eyes Jennifer warily
() 36
: (2) The jock collapses in sobs
tiny, acne-scarred leans over and folds the jock into an unlikely hug
() Oh look, they're united in grief
That'll last
- The automated bell rings
Needy slings on her backpack and hurries over to 's locker
He's packing up a pair of drum mallets
No band practice today
No anything today
It's surreal, right
mean, when just one guy dies in Devil's Kettle, it's like time stops
And now so many people are dead, nobody knows when it's okay to start again
feel guilty just breathing
Word
Chip,  need to tell you something kind of weird
It's about Jennifer
What
You know last night when we were talking and someone came to my door
That was Jennifer
But she didn't talk
She just stood there, smiling at me, but a bad kind of smile
She looked like she'd been beat up or shot or something
She was all bloody
() () 37
: (') And then she barfed up this disgusting prickly stuff that was like roadkill and sewing needles all mixed together
She shudders at the memory Yuck
Like those porcupine meatballs my mom makes with the rice sticking out
Yeah, like almost that bad
and Needy ponder the grotesque image in silence
It was probably because she inhaled a whole bunch of smoke
No
It was something evil
You might want    to talk to the school shrink,    Needy
'm not saying that to    be a dillhole
'm actually kinda    concerned
Chip, 'm a National Merit Scholar
don't tell whoppers and 'm not crazy
didn't say you were crazy
It's just that everyone's a little messed up about this
It's okay to feel
Discombobulated
Yeah, you know
Fucked up
As they prepare to leave,   approaches Needy
He's a cute / guy wearing black nail polish, a lip ring, and full wardrobe by Hot Topic
Hi Needy
() 38
: (2) Chip blatantly scoots closer to Needy, eyeing Colin suspiciously
Oh
Hi, Colin
() heard you were there last night
In the fiery trenches
Uh-huh
Well, 'm glad you made it out
Really
Thanks
Colin walks away
Chip looks jealous
How are you friends with Colin Gray
thought Colin Gray only talked to the Dead Girls
We see a group of   splayed against their lockers in full regalia
One wears an  for no reason
just am
We have Composition together
He's a really good writer
You know-- he's so dark and emotional and all
Oh
can relate
'm also like that, even if 'm not all obvious about it like a poseur
Walk me home
You know it
- , the  we saw sobbing earlier, is standing at the deserted football field
() 39
: It's a gray, overcast fall day and the wind whistles eerily through the trees
The football is set back a good a distance from the school, and Jonas is all alone
In the distance, a tiny figure slowly approaches, It starts a dot on the horizon
As it draws closer, we see it's
Her bright, lipsticked grin is eerie and unmistakable
Jonas glances briefly over his right shoulder, indifferent
few seconds later, he glances again
Strangely, Jennifer '
Jennifer suddenly appears on Jonas's left side, startling him
Hi
() Oh
Hey, Jennifer
'm crazy-sorry about your profound loss
You are crying about Craig, right
He was my best friend
Jennifer puts her arm around him sympathetically
know
was close to him too
You know,  was there last night in that horrible place
saw Craig a few minutes before the fire broke out
You-- you did
Yeah
was probably the last person to talk to him
Like, ever
Literally
Wow
What did he say
() 40
: (2) Well, we got to talking about you, actually
And do you know what he said
He said you were like a brother to him
Not a bro
An actual brother
Jonas's lip trembles as he unsuccessfully fights back tears
Jennifer cuddles closer to him
(choking up) just can't believe he's gone
know,  know
() Hey, you know what else Craig said
What
Forget it
It's too intense
What
Please, Jen, you've gotta tell me
Well, he said he always thought you and me would make a totally bangin' couple
Isn't that so weird
He said bangin'
Jennifer reaches for Jonas's hand and slides it slowly up her shirt, placing it on her left breast
() Feel my heart, Jonas
think it's broken
(choking up) Mine too
() 41
: (3) Come with me
Just for a while
We'll help each other get through this nightmare
It's what Craig would have wanted
Jonas nods dumbly, brainwashed
Jennifer leads him away from the field, toward the  bordering the school campus
They vanish into the woods
In the distance, we see the  rushing into the lake
- Needy and Chip are walking home from school, still deep in discussion
The whole night must be a total blur, right
That's the thing, it's not a blur at all
remember everything, in like ultra-high-def detail
The band, the fire, everything
Especially what happened after
"After" is the part  don't really get, to be honest
Please,  need someone to believe me
Jennifer was-- she was destroyed
She was dying in my hallway, Chip
saw
used my training to check her pulse
And  felt her dying, on the inside,  mean
've known her so long that it's like sometimes can feel what she feels
We're like
and Elliot Ness
believe you
Chip takes Needy's hand and squeezes it
Thanks, Chipper
42
- Jennifer and Jonas are in the woods
Jennifer efficiently whips off her top and bra and begins kissing Jonas hungrily
As Jonas touches her, he recoils
You feel so warm
Why are you so warm
(firmly covering his ) Shutties
She pulls off Jonas' shirt and digs her nails into his arms, kissing him with renewed ferocity
The woods are dead silent
few squirrels approach the clearing, and Jonas watches them warily with one open eye as Jennifer kisses him
Then a deer wanders into the clearing
Then a fox
The animals pause in their tracks and watch, motionless
It's an eerie, unnatural tableau
Animals continue to gather
() Jennifer
Jen
Jennifer is annoyed
What
Look
He gestures to the , who are watching, still as statues
few crows alight on a nearby tree
Mm-hmm
They're waiting
Uh, okay
Jennifer unzips Jonas's jeans and smiles, reaching down and working him with her hand
Jonas moans, still eyeing the animals
Do you miss Craig
() 43
: () Of course
Don't worry
You're going to see your buddy again
You mean like in heaven someday
No
She smiles and shakes her head
Jonas jerks back, creeped out
He tries to pull away from Jennifer, but she's too strong
She  him to the tree
We see her jaw begin to , like some horrible snake
Her eyes cloud over with blood
- horrible  of agony rises from the woods
Mr
Wroblewski is exiting the school, briefcase in hand
He stops in his tracks when he hears the scream
He shakes his head sadly
(to himself) God, they're feeling so much pain
Another scream, this time weaker
(') Let it all out, kids
He heads for his Ford Festiva, then pauses as if thinking better of it
Something isn't right
He puts his keys back in his pocket and walks toward the woods to investigate
'  -  - Needy is preparing herself a fried bologna sandwich in the kitchen
Needy's   chases a ball across the cracked floor
Needy scrapes the sandwich out of the skillet and takes a bite
() 44
: Fried bologna is the bomb
(to ferret) You want some, Greedo
She tuns on the kitchen radio and is surprised to hear a very familiar song: "Through the Trees," by Soft Shoulder
Suddenly, she pauses, a look of  and even crossing her face
She stops and braces herself against the counter, her
Something isn't right
She drops the sandwich
Greedo goes straight for it
(') Something's wrong
As Needy sinks to her knees, she stares straight ahead at the
photo magnet of  leers back at her
She closes her eyes
brief, near-subliminal  of the carnage in the woods
The song ends, snapping Needy out of her reverie
That was Soft Shoulder, the local band who became the unlikely heroes of the tragedy in Devil's Kettle last night
Eyewitnesses say the boys helped numerous people escape the inferno, risking their own lives in the process
That's rock n' roll with a conscience, ladies and gentlemen
Had a lot of requests for that one
- Mr
Wroblewski ventures into the woods, heading toward the clearing
At first, we can only hear mysterious sounds-- scratching and smacking
Birds and animals are closely gathered in a circle
Suddenly, Mr
Wroblewski clutches his arm and gags, realizing the animals are feeding on a huge
looks up, its snout soaked in blood
Mr
Wroblewski begins to scream
The animals scatter
() 45
: glimpse of the : It's Jonas, of course
His entire torso has been torn open, exposing his ribs and guts
Blood and viscera everywhere,  strewn about the forest floor like party streamers
Virgin Mother
Mr
Wroblewski falls to his knees, hollering
'  () - Needy is seated at the kitchen table
She accidentally drops the remains of her sandwich on the floor, where the ferret quickly pillages it
Crap
Needy's mom,  "" , has quietly entered the kitchen in her pajamas
She's pale and sweaty, as if she's been spooked
You said it
Oh, hi, Mom
didn't know you were awake
just had one of my night terrors
It's four o' clock, so technically you had a day terror
Right, right
'm all mixed up since  started working swing again
What did you dream about
dreamed some bad people were trying to nail me to a tree with hammers and big stakes and shit
Just like Jesus
She crosses herself piously
() 46
: (') They were trying to get to you too, but  wouldn't let `em
'm a hard-assed, Ford-tough mama bear
() Yes you are
It's like, don't y'all touch my daughter
'll piss on you like Calvin
You know,  can take care of myself, Mom
That's what you think
One of these days you're gonna be crying out for me and  might not be there
Hey Mom
Did you get a chance to catch the news after you clocked out this morning
No
just did my scratch tickets, snorted a few Lunesta and went straight to bed
Is something going on
Nothing
Forget it
Don't nothing happen in Devil's Kettle
She watches the  skitter across the kitchen floor
(') Anita, that ferret stinks
He needs to be washed from craw to cornhole
Yes ma'am
Toni shakes her head and heads upstairs
47
- hysterical  pierces the twilight
The sun has begun to set
An ambulance and four police cars have pulled up near the woods, which are cordoned off with yellow police tape
Near the woods, ' are crying
His  screams and begins beating the ground with her fists
stretcher is being loaded into the ambulance
exits one of the police cruisers
Her signature giant poofy bangs are in full effect
She rushes to comfort Jonas's bereaved mother
We will get the man that did this to your son
You hear me
We'll get that sick
' 'll get him myself
will
You hear me, you bastard
'll cut off your nutsack and nail it to my door
Like one of those lion doorknockers rich folks got
That'll be your balls
- The sound of Jonas's parents screaming carries across the lake
The water is eerily calm
Suddenly, a  breaks the surface of the lake
It's Jennifer, gliding through the water
She looks calm and serene
The  continues across the lake
The sirens, shouting and chaos contrast sharply with this peaceful scene
Jennifer paddles to the shore and hoists herself onto the pier, naked and dripping wet
She runs her tongue over her teeth briefly and nonchalantly picks something out from between her two front teeth, like she's just finished a delicious rib dinner
Jennifer wrings out her sopping hair and reaches for her clothes, which are neatly folded on the pier
() 48
: Once she's dressed, she walks off into the woods, as if nothing out of the ordinary has happened
'  - Needy is sitting at her lamp-lit desk, reading an old horror comic and eating a banana
The phone rings
Needy picks it up
Needy speaking
: '  - Jennifer's hair is still wet from the lake, but she's changed into shorts and a tank top
Music blasts from her stereo
She admires herself in the mirror, popping her ass
feel sooo scrumptious
She picks up a Soft Shoulder button and  her arm hard with the pin without flinching
Blood spurts from the wound
Good for you
You know, like when you kiss a hot guy for the first time and your whole body feels like it's on vibrate
Yeah
It's that good
Jennifer gazes at her arm, transfixed
She wipes the blood away-- the wound has magically
() 49
: Lucky you
See, 'm still kind of depressed about, you know, the giant smoldering funeral pyre in the middle of town
Move-on dot org, Needy
It's over
Life's too short to mope over some white-trash pig roast
She flicks a Zippo lighter and touches the  to her tongue-- first tentatively, then confidently
That's really nice
tell it like it is
Besides, you should be happy for me
'm having the best day since, like Jesus invented the calendar
Jesus didn't invent the calendar
Jennifer giggles maniacally and sighs with happiness
Needy's call-waiting beeps
(') That's my other line
So blow it off
She casually lights her  on fire
The flames leap up, then die down, leaving her entirely untouched
It'll just be a second
Pooh
'm crossing you out
She draws a mini- in the air
Needy clicks over
It's
We get a nice trifold pie- chart illustrating the intersecting calls
is panicked and sweaty in his living room
In the background, Chip's little sister  bangs on a piano
Red police lights flash outside the picture window
() 50
: (2) need to see you right now
can barely hear you
Camille is playing piano
Knock it off, Camille
You knock it off
Can you meet me at McCullum in ten
You knock it off, Chip
You're penis cheese
Fifteen
Back on : Jennifer is impatiently dragging a razor down her arm
Blood drips onto the rug
She smiles, in awe of herself
Needy clicks back over
(') have to go
What could possibly be more important than me and my godlike powers
have to meet Chip at McCullum Park
Chip is looking cute to me lately
So tell me, is he packing some serious pubic inches
What's the story down there
() gotta go
() 51
: (3) Needy hangs up the phone abruptly and grabs one of her many cardigan sweaters, heading for the door
- The park is dark and tree-lined and appears to be a popular clandestine meeting spot for the youth of Devil's Kettle
The abandoned sand volleyball pits are full of couples making out
Needy runs past them skittishly
As she ascends a grassy hill,  is revealed, silhouetted against a backdrop of twirling police lights
Needy squints at the lights, sees 's house in the distance
Why are the cops at your house
They're not
They're at Jonas Kozelle's house
He got murdered
What
Like, he was shot by gangbangers
() No, Needy
Do you see anyone rollin' on dubs around here
() Someone ripped Jonas limb from limb in the woods behind the school
Ate parts of him
They found teethmarks on him-- on the body
His voice cracks
We see a brief, terrifying  of Jonas's mutilated body and pain-stricken face
Needy doesn't want to believe it
Some animals must've got to him
Human teethmarks
Who would do that
() 52
: don't know
It just happened after school
No one's supposed to know yet, but my dad went over there and talked to the cops
Jonas's mom is catatonic
She's just staring out the front window like a zombie mannequin robot statue
This can't be a coincidence
What do you mean, Needy
fiery death trap last night, and now a cannibal eats our starting tight-end
Come on
Don't get spooky on me, babe
Seriously Chip
Most small towns only have something gruesome happen like, once every decade maybe
Devil's Kettle gets two nightmares in 24 hours
It's freaktarded
It's not right
What, do you think it's, like supernatural
don't know
'm extremely intelligent but  obviously don't know everything
Well, the bad luck's gotta be over now, right
It can't get any worse, right
Obviously it can't
It can't
mean, you agree, right
There won't be another victim
You're shaking
'm cold
It's very cold out here
() 53
: (2) Want my sweater
It's pink
Pink is cool
Rap guys wear pink
She's shaking now, too
Chip leans forward and kisses her
She closes her eyes
In the chaste space between  and Needy's bodies, the volleyball-pit couple fuck like rabbits
: The familiar Soft Shoulder ballad plays as we see a dreamy montage of headlines
The headline of the Devil's Kettle Sun-Post simply reads: "
" The headline of the Minneapolis Star Tribune reads: "'': Devil's Kettle youth brutally murdered in wake of devastating fire
" smaller headline on the front page of the New York Times reads: "Minnesota town rocked by grisly murder, blaze
" We were famous
We were saints
Our town's only bar had burned to the ground and our star quarterback was somebody's Quarter Pounder
The whole country got a huge tragedy boner for Devil's Kettle
And the press-- God, they couldn't get enough of our little world of shit
We see Devil's Kettle citizens holding a tearful candlelight vigil by the former Carousel site
They softly sing along with the Soft Shoulder song
() Through the trees,  will find you
() 54
: We see weeping students shoving flowers through the slats of Jonas' abandoned locker
The hallway floor is covered with teddy bears and bouquets
We see the    as the bouquets wilt and the blooms droop
The pile of discarded scratch-off tickets next to Needy's mother's bed grows steadily as the days go by
Another Star Tribune headline
This one reads: "Two weeks later, cannibal killer still at large
"  smaller subhead reads ": Local band Soft Shoulder sign to major
" The days marched on as usual, but most of us were too numb to enjoy ourselves
Most of us
We see Jennifer cheerfully skipping down the school hallway in a sleazy Technicolor outfit
The rest of the kids look grey, ashen and depressed, but Jennifer pops like a Roman candle
(') Still, we were healing
Like , we figured things could only get better
We had faith
We see clusters of cautiously optimistic kids in the school courtyard
They smile, then laugh, as if they're re-learning how to be happy
(') We were fucking idiots
- It's late September
Leaves are beginning to drift off trees
The surrounding woods are still blocked off with yellow police tape
- Mr
Wroblewski stands solemnly in front of the class, his mechanical hand tensing and releasing nervously
Needy and the rest of the class fidget
Before the period ends,  have an announcement
() () 55
: (') As you know, this is the one month anniversary of the Carousel fire and also the murder of Jonas Kozelle
Bo-ring
We see Jennifer
She looks haggard, thin, and cranky
() Are you okay
No
feel like boo-boo
My skin is breaking out
My hair is dull and lifeless
God, it's like 'm one of the normal girls
Needy smooths her own hair self-consciously
Are you -ing or something
isn't real, Needy
It was invented by the boy-run media to make us seem crazy
Oh
Mr
Wroblewski clears his throat, annoyed by their talking
As  was saying, Needy and Jennifer,  finally have some good news to share with all of you
The members of the rock group Soft Shoulder have decided to extend a helping hand to our community
ripple of excitement in the room
girl seated in the front row is wearing a Soft Shoulder -
(') As you know, their song "Through the Trees" has become our unofficial anthem of unity and healing
So, they've decided to release it as a benefit single
() () 56
: (2) (') 3% of the profits will go to local families who have been affected by loss
The class is happily abuzz-- except Needy, who looks appalled
What about the other 97%
Excuse me
The other 97%
mean, that's just crass
Right
She looks around for support, finding none
(') Crass
It means scummy
Greedy
Am the only one who actually does the vocab drills
, the girl in the Soft Shoulder -shirt, turns to face Needy angrily
Soft Shoulder are American heroes
No, they're not
was there, Chastity
They didn't actually help anyone escape the fire don't even know how that rumor got started
Rumor
It's true
It's on their Wikipedia page
Oh, that's crap
-- They've milked our pain-- our loss- - to get a stupid record deal
No one would even know who they were if they hadn't been playing here that night
They used us
() 57
: (3) (growling, almost ) You take that back, Needy Lesnicki
We need them now more then ever
That's enough
The  rings
Students get up and gather their books for the next period
- Needy and Jennifer slowly head toward their respective lockers
'm already sick of that song
Yeah
It's poorly produced
Could the bass be any lower in the mix
No offense, but you look kind of drained
Is everything all right
'm fine
It's just, like, wearing off or something
What's wearing off
() Are you on pot
No, dick ridge
Just forget  said anything
, the punk/goth boy we met earlier, approaches Jennifer nervously as she exits the classroom
Needy drops behind them, eavesdropping
(to Needy) Hi
(to Jennifer, more ) Hi, Jennifer
() 58
: Oh, hey Colin
Listen, can  copy your bio lab again
never got around to dissecting that kitten fetus
Sure
Actually,  sort of wanted to ask you something
Oh
You want to know if 'll go out with you
No
Well-- yeah
() How did you know
Just go ahead with the pitch
Colin fidgets awkwardly
Well, we've been having a lot of fun in class, you and , and just thought maybe we could go to a movie or something
There's a midnight showing of Rocky Horror at the Bijou next weekend
don't like boxing movies
It's not
fuck it
Never mind
He turns to walk down the hallway, dejected
Jennifer watches him leave
Wait
Colin turns around
(') Why don't you just come by my place tonight
just got Aquamarine on
It's about this girl who's like, half-sushi guess she has sex through her blowhole or something
() 59
: (2) Oh
Great
Okay
'll text you my address
Colin walks away, grinning triumphantly
That was random
'm used to guys asking me out
Colin's a really nice guy
He's into maggot-rock
He wears nail polish
Chip appears behind Needy and drapes his arm over her shoulder
Needy jumps, startled
Hi
() Hi Chip
Needy puts her arm around Chip protectively
(') gotta go parlez French
Slam you later
Jennifer walks away
(to Needy) Talking to your good pal Colin Gray again
No
He was just asking Jennifer out on a date
Chip looks relieved
Can  come over tonight
() 60
: (3) Sure
'd like that
went to Super Target and bought more condoms
Thanks
Not that that has anything to do with my coming over
didn't assume that
Well, 'll see you tonight
Needy waves as Chip walks away
- Colin Gray drives down the street in a big old boat of a classic car
He's blasting punk music on an iPod that's been rigged to the ancient  radio
Colin holds up his   to re-read the directions Jennifer texted him
The street is extremely dark and silent, occupied only by a new townhouse development
The identical units still appear to be under construction
There aren't even any streetlights
The plastic sheeting over the windows flaps eerily in the breeze
Colin's brow furrows in confusion-- it doesn't even look like anyone lives here yet
He checks the phone display again
: The   reads: "trn lft on camerford and your there
first house on rt
1004 camerford
-ya
xoxo jen" Sure enough, the house number is 1004
Colin throws the car into park and walks up to the porch
He looks up and notices a glow coming from an upstairs window, () 61
: Colin presses the doorbell
Nothing happens-- the house isn't wired for electricity yet
'  - Needy and  are kissing on Chip's water bed
Chip fumbles for one of those "fragrance plug-ins" and it into the wall
Needy looks over
For ambiance
It's Jammin' Jasmine
Mmm
My mom has Holiday Scents too, if you're interested
No, this is nice
1004  - Colin enters the house tentatively
It's dark, vacant, and very creepy
There's a very faint glow and soft music coming from upstairs
Yo
He stumbles over a stray 2 x 4
There are piles of sawdust and building materials everywhere-- the house is definitely still under construction
Colin looks confused
skitters over his sneakers
(') Jennifer
Anyone there
The music upstairs grows slightly louder in response
Colin squares his shoulders and heads slowly up the creaking stairs
62
'  - Needy has eased off her top to reveal an endearingly plain white bra, complete with center bow
, also shirtless, cops a feel
He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a fluorescent orange
Needy looks at the wrapper
() "Sensual Swirl
" It's supposed to make it feel good for the girl
Oh
Cool
1004  - Colin follows the music into an empty bedroom
The dark room is filled with blazing candles melting and pooling into bizarre shapes
single  is spread out on the floor
Colin shivers
Behind him, in the doorway, Jennifer appears, her smiling face hellishly aglow
You made it
What's going on
This isn't really your house, is it
No baby
This is our house, just for you and me
We can play Mommy and Daddy
Colin is totally dumbstruck
Do you even know my last name
Silly
've been sending you signals all year
Couldn't you tell
You give me such a wettie
() 63
: She starts  Colin on the neck
We can see confusion-- and fear-- in his eyes
'  - Chip fumbles below his waist, obviously struggling with the condom
Needy leans forward for a closer look
Oh
It's got little bumps on it can hardly wait
1004  - Jennifer grips Colin's face in her hands and forcibly kisses him on the mouth
Colin succumbs, but stiffly
We hear a  noise
Colin pulls away instinctively and sees  and  emerging from the walls, skittering over surfaces
Jennifer
Jennifer looks over her shoulder and giggles
You scared
thought boys like you were into vermin
She unbuttons his jeans
They fall noisily to the floor-- they're the baggy Hot Topic kind with chains and buckles galore
(') Nice hardware, Ace
Colin into Jennifer's eyes
There's something horrible about her face
like she's become almost corpselike
() No way
Oh, don't you dare pass out need you to be conscious
gotta go
() 64
: need you frightened
Colin tries to jerk away, but Jennifer easily disengages his arm from its socket
sickeningly moist
Colin cries out in pain
(') need you hopeless
She slams him to the ground and mounts him
Her jaw unhinges, opening her mouth to a horrifying, inhuman degree
Her teeth are razor-sharp and grotesquely crowded, like they belong to some horribly deformed dog
She descends on him, feeding ravenously
We see their shadows against the wall: Jennifer lunging hungrily, blood spraying up from Colin's jugular
We can hear him screaming and gargling on his own blood
'  - is doggedly pumping away on top of Needy, his eyes closed in concentration
Needy's vacant eyes are suddenly brimming with tears
() Hopeless
hopeless
opens his eyes
What
Am  hurting you
Needy starts weeping
(') Am  too big
Tears roll down Needy's cheeks
She begins moaning, then at that top of her lungs
She hallucinates liquid seeping through the walls, blood and lymph oozing in at the corners and windows
Then the infamous spiny black bile
Pixelated nightmares emerge from the darkness
Skulls, jesters, demons, death
It's the worst acid trip imaginable
Needy rubs her eyes frantically and continues to scream
() 65
: immediately rolls off Needy, concerned
He grabs her and tries to shake some sense into her
(') Needy
What's wrong
Needy continues to shriek hysterically, her voice growing ragged
1004  - We can still hear Colin making inhuman sounds of pain
We can only see the carnage in shadow, but it's clearly unspeakable
'  - Needy clutches her throat, hyperventilating
She stands up and struggles to get dressed
Her breath rasps
Chip is freaking out
Is it something  did
() It's her
Do you need more foreplay
1004  - Colin's thrashing limbs finally go limp
Jennifer is hunched over his remains like a jackal scooping blood into her mouth with cupped hands
We see his eyes, flecked with blood, pupils dilated white  crawls over his face
'  - Needy races toward the door with Chip in pursuit
Needy
() 66
: have to go
'm sorry
just
feel like something
something terrible
You feel-- What does that even mean
'm worried about you
'm so sorry, Chip
'm so sorry
Everything is just wrong
She bolts out the room, leaving Chip naked and alone
He pulls his knees up to his chest, vulnerable
'  - Needy runs toward her mom's , a beat-up Kia parked on the curb
She climbs into the car and starts the ignition, trembling and crying
She pulls out onto the street and guns it
She swings a hard left
The streets are all almost identical, lined by working-class homes
She turns on the radio
The song is, of course, "Through the Trees" by Soft Shoulder
She pounds the dashboard, hysterical
Fudge
Fudge
Maple fudge
Needy seizes the wheel drives recklessly down a dark, tree-lined street
Then, she sees something bright emerge from the shadows
Her eyes widen
It's , creeping toward the curb like an animal
She's pale in the moonlight
The entire lower half of her face is covered in blood, like a ghoulish beard of gore
She flashes a huge, deranged, toothy  at Needy
Needy screams and
The car fishtails out of control and slides into a ditch
Needy slams her foot onto the accelerator, trying to get out of the trench
She glances desperately out the side window
Jennifer is gone
Panting, Needy tries to accelerate again
() 67
: Suddenly, Jennifer appears from out of nowhere and her body against the windshield, her long limbs splayed like an insect's
The windshield
Jennifer grins at Needy through the cracking glass
Needy screams again, puts the pedal to the floor, and manages to rear up out of the ditch
Jennifer's body tumbles off the car as Needy goes roaring down the street
That was, of course, Soft Shoulder
They're going to be playing a benefit concert in Devil's Kettle next month
Talk about giving back to the community
Generous guys,  tell ya
'  - Needy throws the car into park and races up the front walk
She unlocks the door, shaking and fumbling
She bursts into the darkened house
'  - Mommy
Mommy
Please be home
No reply
Needy braces herself against the kitchen counter and bawls
She falls to her knees and curls up on the floor, exhausted
Her eyes drift shut
've always been able to feel what she feels
Just not like this
-  - Little Needy and Little Jennifer are playing Barbies in a sandbox
Needy holds a brand new, immaculate Barbie doll
'll be Perfect Prom Barbie and you be her
She tosses Needy a naked brunette doll with its hair chopped off and an arm missing
() 68
: Why do  have to be Ugly Ashley
You can be Ugly Ashley or Ken
Choose
She puts her hand down in the sand emphatically and suddenly  in pain
What's wrong, Jennifer
Jennifer lifts her hand
There's a  stuck in her palm and it's bleeding
(trying to swear like a grown-up) Damn
Ass
Needy grabs Jennifer's hand, pulls out the tack and wipes away the blood
It's still bleeding
Panicking, she leans forward and instinctively puts her mouth to the wound
Jennifer watches quietly
Needy pulls away
Better
We should get a Band-Aid though
We're sisters now, you know
Needy nods
(') Don't tell my mom about this
She'll make me get a shot
never tell on you
- (  ) Needy   in a cold sweat, gasping
She's still on the kitchen floor
She peels herself up off the floor, disoriented
69
'  () - Needy trudges into her dark bedroom
She strips off her clothes and stumbles into bed
' What's up, Monistat
Needy flicks on her bedside lamp, petrified
Jennifer is curled up in bed beside her, reclining casually
She's freshly showered and wearing one of Needy's dorky - shirts
Needy screams at the top of her lungs and leaps out of bed, pulling the covers with her
God, enough screaming already
You're such a cliche
Get out
But we always share your bed when we have slumber parties
She winks conspiratorially at Needy
What the fuck is happening
Whoa
have never heard you drop the -bomb before
What's buggin'
saw you
saw you
The car
the
() Buh-buh-buh
Slow down, tardy slip
You sound like a sped
'm calling the police
Go ahead, narc me out
've got the cops in my back pocket
'm fucking a cadet, remember
() 70
: What do you want
want to explain some things to you
You've already seen too much and besides-- best friends don't keep secrets
Right
Needy nods, terrified
(') Remember the night of the fire
Yeah, it rings a bell
Well,  got pretty messed up almost died
You know those guys in Soft Shoulder
Totally evil
They're basically agents of Satan with awesome haircuts
figured that out as soon as  got into their molester van
'  () - Jennifer is crouched in the back of the van
None of the band members are speaking
Nikolai Wolf drives down a gravel road, away from the fire site and deep into the woods
Guys
Where are we going
Shut your mouth, object
() Nikolai
Jennifer looks around the van, wide-eyed
There's glow-in- the-dark Satanic imagery painted all over the walls: goats heads, pentagrams, and strange coded writing
She sees a few books sliding around on the floor: "Spells and Incantations," "Summoning the Beast," and a copy of the Black Mass
Jennifer springs to her feet and tries to escape out the side door
, the drummer, grabs her ankles, taking her down
() 71
: Are you guys rapists
You wish
Jennifer struggles again, but Mick holds her down
(to band members) Hey guys
Do we even know if she's a virgin
in Jennifer's eyes
Maybe if she lies she can save herself
Yes
yes
Of course 'm a virgin
've never done sex ever
don't even know how
So maybe you should find some other girl who does
Know how
Told you, Dirk
You owe me a beer
() Sure, man
() - The van rumbles down an uneven forest path, deep into the woods
They arrive at the real Devil's Kettle-- roaring, ominous waterfalls
There's a crude stone altar illuminated by moonlight
'  ( ) - Needy is still cowering on her bedroom floor, captivated by the tale in progress
Jennifer is reclining in the bed with a relaxed, supernatural glow
What did they do to you
Just let me finish
So they drove all the way out to the falls tried to figure out an escape, but it was so dark out there
72
() - The door of the van slides open
Nikolai pulls Jennifer out of the van and hustles her into the clearing
He looks up into the sky
We got a waxing moon
Perfection
You're the man, Wolf
The four band members surround Jennifer, looking statuesque in their sexy rock n' roll ensembles
Without warning, Nikolai hauls off and  Jennifer
She yelps and falls onto her back on the dirt
Dirk looks apprehensive
don't know if we should go through with this
() Do you want to be rich and famous like the guy from Maroon 5
Or do you want to be a huge suicidal loser
() Maroon 5
Then grow a pair and fetch me the ritual
God
Dirk obediently heads over to the van
He pushes the intimidating-looking magical books aside and retrieves a single folded piece of computer paper
That's it
What
found it on Google
He unfolds the piece of paper and clears his throat
() 73
: The guys have dragged Jennifer onto the makeshift altar and are holding her down
She struggles and screams, but Dirk slaps her again
(') We come here tonight to sacrifice the body of
He tries to remember Jennifer's name and fails
(') this chick from Devil's Kettle
() My name is Jennifer
That's fascinating
Dirk and Mick exchange nervous glances
Please let me go
'll do anything
Anything you want
Nikolai examines her with an appraising eye
only hump nines and tens
You're a seven at best, even with the chicken cutlets
He reaches into Jennifer's bra and casually pulls out a , tossing it aside
Jennifer rears up and  in his artfully rumpled hair
Nikolai smooths his `do, enraged
(') 'm gonna carve you like a pumpkin, bitch
Don't you know that me and my boys are in league with the Beast himself
He wiggles his menacingly pointy fingers in her face
(') We've spent months making offerings to the "man downstairs," and whaddya know
Satan delivered
We went from college radio to being courted by the majors in two months
() () 74
: (2) (') But that's not enough, Jenny
We want designer drugs
We want groupies that have their own groupies
We want speedballs and stadium tours and Skittles sorted by color
In short, we want more
And to get more, we have to butcher you
And bleed you
() Maybe you could just hire a publicist
Make some -shirts or something
Hey,  could be on your street team
Sorry, darling
Please
() Start chanting, boys
The group begins chanting jibberish in unison
Jennifer struggles, watching as their eyes go hollow and black
(') With deepest malice, we deliver this virgin unto thee
He unsheathes a huge, gleaming knife and raises it Psycho- style, admiring his reflection in the blade
Dude, that is a hot murder weapon
It's a bowie knife
Bowie
Nice
Snickering, Nikolai begins to sing "Starman" by David Bowie
The group joins in merrily
"There's a starman waiting in the sky
" "He'd really like to meet us, but he thinks he'd blow our minds
" () 75
: (3) As the group sings, Nikolai brings the knife down with a grin
We hear Jennifer , sounds of violence and clothes ripping as Nikolai relentlessly beats her and stabs her, his face contorting demonically
The band continues to sing, their voices carrying over the trees
Nikolai walks over to where the "devil side" of the falls rushes into a black hole
He drops the murder weapon into the churning water, smiling
'  ( ) - Needy's expression is both incredulous and horrified
Jennifer is totally matter-of-fact
She picks at her nails with a wooden cuticle stick from Needy's night stand
Being tortured would make most girls black out or something
But 'm so hard core,  was with them the whole time
could feel them gutting me Under my ribs, up into my belly, then right through my heart
They
killed you
'm here, aren't
She shakes her head, annoyed with Needy
(') mean, yeah
They went Benihana on my ass
It should have killed me
But for some reason, it didn't
() Maybe it did
Whatever
Anyway,  don't really remember what happened after that
just-- woke up a few hours later and found my way back, somehow
76
'  () - We see Jennifer staggering down the street, battered, mutilated and bloody
She spits a few  onto the curb, clutching her chest
We see her wander toward Needy's house
'  ( ) - remember
couldn't bring myself to hurt you
mean, 'm a really good friend
But  felt so hungry had to do something
() - Jennifer is wandering down a rural road in a daze
She hears a faint
Jennifer stops and sees a hunched walking down the opposite side of the street
It's , the foreign student
He's covered in soot and looks traumatized
Jennifer takes a step
Ahmet takes a step
Jennifer stops
Ahmet stops
Their eyes meet
Jennifer crosses the street
Ahmet stares at her, frightened
Jennifer addresses him in a quiet, gravelly voice
Ahmet
You made it out
Ahmet coughs
(') Are you lost
Ahmet
(') Does your host family know you're alive
Ahmet shakes his head
(') Does anyone know you're alive
() 77
: Ahmet shakes his head again
(') Come with me
We'll sort this out
She takes Ahmet's hand
As her   dig into his wrist, his eyes widen
'  ( ) - Ever since then,  just somehow knew what  needed to do to be strong
And when 'm full--like am right now--'m like, immortal
can do stuff like this
Jennifer jams the   into her own forearm and drags it through her flesh
Needy screams and covers her mouth
(') No biggie
Watch
She pulls out the stick
The wound seals over instantly
Needy gasps and touches Jennifer's unmarked arm
(') That's some -Men shit, right
What do you mean, "when you're full"
You know
Full
Like full of tasty morsels
Needy shakes her head, not comprehending
(') Forget it
You'd probably tell on me anyway
Not that anyone would believe you
You always think the world is coming to an end
What about my mom's Kia
Why did you attack me out there
Why were you covered in blood
You didn't even look human
Jennifer rolls her eyes
() 78
: You should talk to someone about these disturbing thoughts you're having
We're all concerned
Especially Chip
think he's having second thoughts about you
() Leave
My, aren't we a --Next-Tuesday
Come on
Let me stay the night
We can play "boyfriend/girlfriend" like we used to
She smiles seductively
Needy crawls further away from her, shivering
Jennifer rolls her eyes and gets out of bed
She walks over to the second-story window and cranks it open
What are you doing
You said to leave
So 'm outtie- 5000
She climbs onto the windowsill
Needy watches, confused
(') See you at school
She  gracefully out the window
Needy watches in stunned silence for a few moments
Then she creeps over to the window and looks out
Nothing there but the wind
Jennifer's gone
- We're in a small Catholic cemetery
small, neat gravel path runs through the stately old monuments into a small valley where a funeral is taking place
() 79
: Faint moaning and sobbing can be heard
Then, a procession of 6 or 7 /  appears on the crest of the hill
They move forward into the cemetery, flamboyantly dressed in black capes, chains, cloaks, neon hairpieces, fishnets, mesh, 18-hole combat boots, etc
These are Colin Gray's friends
One girl scatters blood-red rose petals dramatically on the path as she stumbles along, weeping
At the bottom of the hill, Colin Gray's very conservative- looking family stands next to the fresh grave, surrounded by sympathetic mourners
stands near the back, looking shell-shocked
There are also a few press photographers snapping photos, and of course, a Catholic priest
We gather here today to celebrate the life of Colin Gray, who was plucked from the prime of
The priest and family are momentarily distracted by the motley crew of Goths descending on the funeral
The priest clears his throat disapprovingly

No, Kevin
Those are just his fleshly remains
He's among the dark angels of the realm now
Fly, Colin
Fly into the firmament
She lights a bundle of  and waves it in the air
Colin's father gags, appalled
Is it cool if we camp here for a few days
We want to commune with his corpse
He was our spooky homeboy
() 80
: (2) Children, this is a private service for family only
(to Colin's mother) Oh, right
need to ask you something, Mrs
Gray
It's really important for me to have closure
Young lady, have some respect for this family
(waving him off) No
It's fine
Is it true that Colin had a date with Jennifer Check the night he was killed
She says "Jennifer Check" as if it were the most disgusting name imaginable
Needy covers her face
(') Because Jennifer Check is a social disease
She's not like us
She thinks she's so special just because she's popular and and is what "society" considers "attractive
" But she's not sincere
She's about as emo as a breast implant
And she listens to Jessica Simpson and shops at Hollister
And  just know Colin would never go out with someone like that, and  just need confirmation
From you
So did he
Did he
Have a date with Jennifer Check
Colin's parents stare at the ground
(') Oh God
Oh God
knew it
That will erase her
'll put a freaky Druid spell on her
() () 81
: (3) (') 'll spell her preppy ass right into the ground
The parents flinch
Um, Chloe
Maybe you should be mad at the person who murdered Colin
All Jennifer Check did was invite him over to watch Aquamarine
That's
She throws herself to the ground, crying and pounding the dirt like a toddler
Colin Gray's mother buries her head in her hands and begins weeping
Mr
Gray attempts to comfort her
Colin wouldn't have liked this
(losing it) Oh, you think so, Powder
Yeah, you're right
'm pretty sure my son wouldn't have liked being eaten by a fucking  and buried before his eighteenth birthday
Wow, you must have known him so well
Jill
The goth boy looks terrified
But Mrs
Gray's not done ranting yet
By the time they found Colin in that godforsaken house, he looked like lasagna with teeth
'd know-- had to identify the remains
My boy's not in the realm of the undead
He's not flying around in the firmament with magical wings of flame
He's in an overpriced rosewood box that's headed six feet downtown
She kicks the coffin to illustrate
() 82
: (4) (') So you can take your pain and shove it up your asses, kids
got the monopoly on pain
The kids stare at her in awe
Needy watches as Mrs
Gray collapses into Mr
Gray's arms
- Two girls are hanging an homemade banner on the fence surrounding the football field
It says " 5 --
" Needy walks briskly toward school, huddled in her parka
She looks totally fucked up, like she hasn't slept in days
There are hollows beneath her eyes
They did a big memorial assembly for Colin at school, and we had to watch another presentation about curfews and the buddy system and how to deal with grief
But nobody seemed to care anymore
Sorrow was last week's emotion
We see Jennifer a few yards away, talking and laughing with some other flag team members
(') Jennifer and  hadn't spoken since our encounter in my room
Actually,  hadn't really spoken to anyone
was busy with research
Paranormal research
Needy gazes off into the distance with bloodshot eyes
As she stares at Jennifer, she see has a series of brief, gruesome : Jennifer as a grinning death mask
Jennifer as a corpse, the lower half of her face rotted away
Jennifer as a harlequin monster
Needy hears the rush of her own blood, the barely audible buzzing of flies
Chip jogs up next to her, jolting her out of her reverie
Hey
Did you buy Turnabout tickets yet
don't get paid until next week
() 83
: gotta show you something
What is it
Not here
Behind the school
What is it

Yes, but  promise you this is the last thing  need to show y-- () Needy,  care about you

As a person, not just a girl  made love to for four minutes the other night
And 'm scared of what's happening to you
You're acting really fucked up
Please just let me show you
Her gaze is so intense and crazed that Chip has no option but to submit
He nods reluctantly
- Needy and Chip walk to an alley behind the school
Melting snow drips off the eaves
Needy pulls out a large black binder and opens it
It's full of copies from the library and Internet printouts
The spine reads " " Look at this
She thrusts a piece of paper into 's hands

Those guys from that band were trying to sacrifice her in the woods
But what they didn't realize is that she hasn't been a virgin since junior high
Jennifer's a total cum-dumpster
It all makes sense now

She grabs the piece of paper from him
(') () "If the human sacrifice is impure, the result may still be attained, but a demon will forever reside the soul of the victim
She must forever feed on flesh to sustain the demon
" See
looks more dubious than ever
Uh-huh
She's eating boys
They make her strong
Really strong
And when she's hungry, she gets weak and cranky and her hair is all full of split ends
And look at this
She holds up one of the printouts
(') It says that before the demon feeds, it vomits a gruesome substance on its prey
Like  saw
() 85
: (2) You--you really think Jennifer killed Jonas and Colin
And possibly Ahmet from India
Needy is silent for a moment
She realizes  will never believe her and that she'll lose him forever if she continues babbling
Really
You think she ate those guys
No
No
Of course not
Is that what you think
No
Listen, 'll make an appointment with Mr
Feely

It's all right, Needy
This has been a crummy school year, Chip
No shit
Needy turns and pitches the black binder into a Dumpster
Listen, 'm done with all that devil stuff
Do you know what you're wearing to Turnabout
was thinking a suit with black shoes and a boutonniere, right here

Needy laughs

Only  wasn't actually crazy
Everyone else was crazy
But when you're the only sane one, you might as well be crazy
It's subjective, you know
What color dress are you gonna wear

How about magenta
You're definitely a winter
My mom says winters should wear regal jewel tones like magenta
Or possibly teal

Well, 'll try to find something magenta
That'll look dope

The theme is "Through the Trees" and there are papier mache trees everywhere
'  - Needy stands in front of a full-length mirror, wearing a big `80s-style magenta prom dress
It sags on her flat chest and looks ridiculous

: Greedo the ferret circles her ankles
Toni, Needy's mom, appears behind her with a curling iron
You look beautiful
look pork stupid
No, you've got that tiny waist, like a fashion model
always thought you looked like Cindy Crawford
She gently takes off Needy's glasses
Who's Cindy Crawford
One of the great beauties of our time
She's even got a mole like you, except hers is on her face
She takes a section of Needy's hair and wraps it around the curling iron
Smoke rises
Ow
You're too close to my neck
Well, if Chip gives you a hickey, you can just tell everyone burned you
Gross, Mom
Chip isn't that ostentatious
Now that's a word you don't hear every day
Hold still
What are you doing to my hair
Hooker helmet
() 88
: (2) () Aw, jeez Mom
If you can't have big what-nots, you might as well have big hair
Needy stares at herself in the mirror
Despite Toni's best efforts, Needy looks like the walking dead

Suddenly, there's a loud  on the door

We hear the voice of '  through the door

Hang on
Chip puts on a robe and opens the door
Chip's mom is holding a

Chip reluctantly accepts the spray

'm gonna walk
It's so warm outside
It's like 40
' want pictures with your sister before you go
Yes, ma'am
'  ( ) - Needy is fully dressed and garishly made up
Toni holds a digital camera at arm's length and takes a shot of the two of them together
The mother/daughter photo looks ghastly
Toni's eyes are closed and Needy pouts miserably
'  ( ) - Chip's mother snaps a series of stiffly posed photos of Chip and his little sister, Camille
We can see the   tucked into the interior of Chip's jacket
' One more
Back to back
Big smiles
Camille, we don't touch ourselves down there
That's our lady garden
90
( ) - The gym is decorated to look like an enchanted forest large banner reads "Through the Trees- Turnabout Dance" There are streamers and balloons everywhere in sickly shades of green and purple
plays badly-mixed pop music
Couples drift into the gym
The   who were at Colin Gray's grave travel in a pack, sulking
The goth girl who loved Colin wanders through the decorations and pops every balloon she passes with a pin
As she pops them, she narrates dramatically
(popping balloon) This is my heart
(') (popping balloon) My soul
(') (popping balloon) Everything  once believed in
Another  , looking exasperated, grabs a balloon, shoves it under her babydoll dress and pops it
#2 () Your abortion
She rapidly shoves another one under her dress and pops it again, smirking
#2 (') Your other abortion
hate your guts, Madison
The girls glare at each other
Needy walks in, looking small and apprehensive in her bad `80s dress
She looks around for Chip, but he's not there yet
few mean kids point at her dress and snicker
Needy ladles some juice into a paper cup and leans against the wall, waiting anxiously for her Prince Charming
91
- Chip is cutting through the park on his way to the dance
He whistles to himself
Across the park, he sees a   trotting toward him
The dog pants aggressively
tries to smile, but looks uncomfortable
few  emerge from the trees, gazing curiously at him
'    - Couples are beginning to grind against each other on the dance floor
Needy watches them longingly
She checks her Mickey Mouse watch
- Chip picks up the pace, jogging down the path
In the distance behind him we can barely make out Jennifer's form
She looks more spectral then we've ever seen her
Chip speeds up instinctively
Suddenly, Jennifer's about ten paces closer
Then she's closer again, as if she can fold space and time
She's ethereal, flickering
turns to look over his shoulder
'    - The music fades out and there's a squeal of feedback from the sound system
Mr
Wroblewski walks onto the stage in a bad suit
He awkwardly picks up the mic with his one good hand and pats it with his robotic one
Can  have everyone's attention please
The students turn to look at him, annoyed by the distraction
() 92
: (') Welcome to the Turnabout Dance hope you've all had an opportunity to consume the Pecan Sandies and Cran-Grape that were so generously donated by the Parents Club
Murmuring and applause
(') But the real treat is yet to come
It's happening right about now, this treat of which  speak
We have some very special guests tonight
They were kind enough to take a break from their sold-out national tour and play our dance for free
Needy gags on her juice
- Chip continues to hurry briskly along through the park
makes an incoherent noise and jumps as Jennifer appears, improbably, right in front of him
She's wearing a gorgeous white formal gown and looks perfect
(') Didn't you hear me calling your name
You weren't calling my name
Yes,  was
couldn't hear it
think you were maybe spacing out
You were like this: Derrrrr
She mimics a blank, drooling expression
was
() 93
: Yes, exactly like that
Listen, need to talk to you about you-know- who
Our little Needy
know
Are you worried
`Cause 'm super- stressed about her
God knows how even sleep at night
She hasn't been the same for weeks
think  know what's wrong with her
In fact,  know  know what's wrong with her
Then tell me
feel bad telling you this
() Okay, you know Needy's been a total Lithium candidate since the night Colin Gray died
But that's not just because he was brutally murdered and stuff
It's because
don't wanna say this
Say it
Needy and Colin were intimate
By that  mean he was poking her donut on a semi-regular basis
looks astonished and hurt
(') know this must be hard for you to hear
Needy's not like that
() 94
: (2) That's what she wants you to believe
But trust me, her and Colin were doing stuff you haven't even heard of
Total varsity moves
But you were with Colin the night he was killed
Well, apparently he had a thing for me-- no surprise there
And figured Needy was busy jumping your jock that night, so  agreed to a little pity date
Colin brought me to that empty house so we could have some privacy
But he wanted to go too far, so  left after a few minutes
Next thing knew, they'd found
She sniffles, wiping her eye
(') what was left of him
(to himself) Eye-talian
Huh
Never mind
'm sorry you had to hear this from me
'm just so worried about Needy
She's losing her shit
Colin was her everything
looks miserable
(') wouldn't be surprised if she winds up in the nuthouse
just can't believe this
() 95
: (3) Well, you've been talking to her more than  have
How bad is it
It's bad, man
It's bad
can only imagine the paranoid theories she's come up with
Oh, you have no idea
just can't believe she would do this to you
care so much about you, Chip
glances up at her
She's earnest, beautiful
(') More than 've ever had the guts to admit
- Mr
Wroblewski pauses dramatically for effect
Boys and girls, please welcome
Soft Shoulder
The heavy stage curtains part to reveal   in all their glory
Success has treated them well-- they're glowing and wearing designer rock n' roll couture
They look like the young Rolling Stones
Needy drops her cup
Juice splatters onto the ground
Good evening, babies
Are you ready for some bad vibrations
The students rush the stage, shrieking
Nikolai raises his fist and the band launches into a heavy, uptempo version of "Through the Trees
" Needy looks as though she's had a revelation
look of pure horror crosses her face
Chip
() 96
: She rushes toward the gym exit, tripping in her high heels
- is hypnotized in the glow of the streetlights
Jennifer leans forward and kisses him on the neck Needy didn't deserve a boy like you
- Needy is running toward the park in her gown
She takes off her shoes and tosses them aside, her arms and legs pumping furiously
One thing people don't know about me is that 'm fast
just never went out for track because  look bad in shorts
Also, Jennifer told me track was for lezzies
But am
Fast,  mean
Even in that fucking afterbirth of a dress, could really tear up the asphalt
She picks up the pace, cheeks puffing
(') had to
was running for his life
- Jennifer is kissing Chip
She pulls him down onto the damp, muddy grass
Ooh, you're so salty
Yeah, you too
Say it like you mean it
You're so salty
need water
It burns
The salty burns my mouth
() 97
: Say 'm better than Needy
What
Why
We really shouldn't be doing this
She pulls away from him, feigning a guilty conscience
() You're better than Needy
Jennifer smiles, satisfied
Natch
She resumes kissing him enthusiastically
This feels weird
Can we go somewhere else
have just the place
She stands up and starts to lead Chip toward an abandoned, fenced-off
It's drained and spooky and looks dangerous
Murphy Pool
don't think we can go in there
knew some skater guys who went in there
They got in big trouble and now they have to pick up garbage for 100 hours
Jennifer giggles and pulls him along
You're in big trouble anyway
Come on
She begins to climb the chain link fence
'  - Needy jogs toward 's house
Exhausted and sweaty, she presses the doorbell
She falls to her knees on the front stoop, panting and wheezing
() 98
: Camille answers the door
() Well, hi there Camille
Is Chipper home
Camille has no reply
She eyes Needy suspiciously and licks a Popsicle
's mother appears and shoves Camille aside
' Needy
Is something wrong
Where's Chip
' () He left for the dance at least twenty minutes ago
He certainly should have been there by now
He walked
Mrs
Dove, you mean to only tell me that in these dangerous, godless times-- you let your only son walk alone at night
' Well, it's only five blocks
My God, your hair is
Which way did he go
' He usually cuts across the park
She turns to scold Camille
'  (') Camille, let's sit like a lady
No one wants to see your kiki
She turns back to address Needy
'  (') Why don't you try
But Needy's gone
() 99
: (2) '  (') Anita
- Murphy Pool is even eerier from the inside
The fenced-in deck area is littered with garbage, abandoned pool furniture and graffiti
Someone has spray painted the word "" on a wall
shivers and looks around nervously
Jennifer nonchalantly unzips her dress and shimmies out of it, revealing her bra and panties
Aren't you cold
Never, Trevor
'm hot like magma
She prances over to the abandoned pool and begins to climb down the ladder on the side
The pool is full of filthy, freezing water
What are you doing
Swimming
Ha ha
Come on in, Chip
Show me your breast stroke
The water looks disgusting
It's not so bad
Are you kidding
It's totally bubonic in there
think  see a dead possum with a Doritos bag in its pouch
And that looks like a used syringe over there
He slaps away a
() 100
: 'm sorry
was just trying to make you laugh
think now, more than ever, we need laughter
We've both lost a close friend
nods sadly
know
feel so empty
Me too
Please come here and kiss me again
Make all this madness go away
Chip tiptoes forward tentatively and sinks to his knees
He leans in and kisses Jennifer, who's still clinging to the ladder
The sound of buzzing flies grows louder
Suddenly, Jennifer opens her eyes
She hooks her arm around Chip's neck and lunges backward
They tumble off the ladder, into the pool
Chip
- Needy runs into the park and scans the dark horizon
Her bare feet are bloody from running and her face is shiny with sweat
() Chip
terrified  in the distance
Needy whips around, hikes up her skirt and starts running toward Murphy Pool
She reaches the fence and starts climbing it
She slips and cuts her hand on a broken link
screams again on the other side of the fence
() 101
: (') 'm coming
She flings herself over the top of the fence, her body slamming against the concrete pool deck
Her  snaps
It's a compound fracture, the bone thrusting through the flesh of her arm as she screams
- Needy staggers toward the pool, which is surrounded by an extraterrestrial glow
Chip's moaning is almost unbearable
Needy stares into the abyss and claps her hands over her mouth
Jennifer is waist deep in the  , flinging Chip against the wall like a rag doll
He's still conscious, but his skin on his chest has been   to expose his ribs
Jennifer is  happily
Chip looks at Needy, his face a mask of agony
() Needy
Holy crap
Jennifer begins gnawing on Chip's neck, so engaged in the task that she doesn't notice Needy
Needy climbs up on the diving board and crosses herself
(') Saint Jude, patron saint of hopeless causes: Please give me the power to crush this bitch
Jennifer looks up with demonic, bloodshot eyes just as Needy leaps off the diving board
Needy lands on Jennifer's shoulders, taking her out
She wraps her legs around Jennifer's neck and drags her under the water
Jennifer emerges
Needy grabs her by the hair and girly- slaps her furiously across the face
Then she spots the lying by the side of the pool
She grabs it and sprays it in Jennifer's eyes
Jennifer shrieks and vomits ,   all over Needy and Chip
() 102
: Fuck this
shit
Jennifer  straight up into the air like a goddess, hovering ten feet above the pool
Her eyes burn
Her skin is corpselike
She's drenched from head to toe in the prickly ooze
() She can fly
She's just hovering,
It's not that impressive
Jennifer speaks in a metallic, demonic-sounding voice
God, do you have to undermine everything  do
You're such a player-hater
Needy glares at Jennifer, surprisingly fearless
You're a jerk
Nice insult, Lizzie McGuire
Got any more harsh digs
You know what
You were never a good friend
Ever
Even when we were little
You used to steal my toys and pour lemonade on my bed and make me be Ugly Ashley when we played Barbies
And now 'm eating your boyfriend
See
At least 'm consistent
Why do you need him
Huh
She begins to weep
(') () Why do you need the one guy who's ever liked me
You can have anyone, Jennifer
() () 103
: (2) (') The cutest guy in school
The mailman
teacher
You could probably even have a huge star like Chad Michael Murray
So why Chip
Why him
Is it just to piss me off
Or is it because you're insecure
Jennifer floats in midair toward the pool deck and drifts down, landing on her feet
Needy crawls out of the pool and faces her down
am not insecure
God, what a joke
How could  be insecure was the Snowflake Queen
Yeah, two years ago
When you were socially relevant
You were skinny then, too
look of   on Jennifer's face
She reels back against the chain link fence, her eyes blazing
'm gonna eat your soul and shit it out, Lesnicki
Her voice is now an unearthly growl
In the background, Chip is slowly, painfully pulling a   with an eight-foot handle off the pool deck
() thought you only murdered boys
go both ways
She  herself toward Needy, roaring, her eyes white- hot, her jaws agape
She's monstrous
Chip suddenly stumbles in front of Needy and holds the of the   in front of them like a spear
As Jennifer flies forward at demonic speed, she on the handle
Needy screams
There's a beat of deafening silence
() 104
: (3) Chip collapses on the pool deck
Jennifer rises uncertainly to her feet, "shishkebabbed" on the giant skimmer
With effort, she pulls the handle out of her body in several stages
(') Ow-Ow-Ow
Needy watches, and realizes Jennifer is injured
Blood drips onto the pool deck
() We hurt you
Blood trickles out of Jennifer's wound
She tries to plug the hole with her hand
Got a tampon
Needy shakes her head mutely
(') Thought 'd ask
You seemed like you might be pluggin'
She begins to climb the fence, wincing in pain, then glances over her shoulder at Needy and Chip
Where are you going
Fuck this noise
'm out
You losers are more trouble then you're worth
She continues climbing
() Why give up now
He's almost dead
Get your bulimic ass back here and kill us both
Nah
mean, you say 've been a bad friend all these years might as well throw you a bone
() 105
: (4) She smirks and jumps over the fence, stumbling off into the distance
Needy watches her, her eyes narrowing with hate
Once Jennifer has disappeared, Needy turns her attention to Chip, who is barely alive
She stares in horror at his torn arm and exposed ribs, then falls to her knees over his body
Oh, Chip
Needy
You saved me
'm gonna call for help
She reaches into Chip's pocket and pulls out his beat-up cell phone
She wipes off the prickly ooze with her hand
Oh no, 'm out of minutes
think 911 is always a free call
Oh yeah
You're right
Needy dials to no avail
The phone is hopelessly clogged with ooze
She knocks it against the deck
It's not working
It's full of Jennifer-goo
Chip begins gagging and coughing
He rolls onto his back, his eyelids fluttering
() Hey, 'm going somewhere
No
You're not going anywhere
'm toast, Needy
'm definitely gonna die
think  already died before you were here, but  woke up when  heard your voice
() 106
: (5) love you
Yeah me too
And you look hot in that dress
You're clearly delirious
No
When you're dying, you can see everything a lot clearer
You can see what's true and what's not
The things that are true have this glowing halo of light around them, like a picture of the Baby Jesus, or Barbara Walters when they use the special lens
And  know for sure that you're totally hot
Needy begins to sob hoarsely
(') You'd better get out of here
The police are going to come and don't want them to, you know, make a mistake
'm never leaving
But  have to go
No
Chip's eyes close
His face relaxes
He's gone
Needy wails at the top of her lungs
She rests her head against his mutilated chest, oblivious to the blood and bone
'    - The dance is in full swing and students are slow-dancing
Girls rest their heads against boys' chests, only under far less macabre circumstances than Needy and 's deathbed tableau
Soft Shoulder are still playing onstage, their guitars chiming melodically
() 107
: The bass player, Dirk, turns toward Nikolai Wolf
This sucks old-man balls
Shut up
It's good
He accidentally speaks into the mic, attracting unwanted stares from the kids
(') (to audience) said, it's so good to be here
The students cheer approvingly, their faces bright and hopeful
Nikolai bares his teeth in a frighteningly fake smile
C0RVALLIS  - Illuminated by lamp light, Needy limps toward the gym entrance
She's completely covered in demon-goo
Her face is bloody, her hair is full of blood and guts, and her looks gruesome
In the background, yet another oblivious  are making out
Needy stops to stare at them, her gaze calm but obviously insane
They break apart and stare back at her
What are you looking at, Clumpy
() Just watching your old man try to suck the ugly off your face
What did you say
Needy bends over, casually holds one nostril closed, and does a "farmer blow
"  bloody clot flies out of her nose
The guy takes a good look at Needy and blinks, startled
(') Are you supposed to be Goth or something
() 108
: Did you know the original Goths were a Germanic tribe that settled in Rome
They didn't wear black
They wore regular linen tunics don't know why nobody else knows that
The couple have already resumed making out
Needy rolls her eyes, turns away, and continues limping into the gym
- Needy enters the gym and slams the door shut behind her
People ignore her as she slowly walks toward the stage
They're too busy slow dancing and laughing in their respective cliques
She looks up at the stage, where Soft Shoulder are playing an insufferably long coda
Nikolai noodles through a guitar solo, then looks up and sees Needy looking directly at him, her eyes full of hate
Nikolai gulps nervously and elbows Dirk
Needy points to her eyes with two fingers, then points at Nikolai, as if to say, Gotcha
She looks completely possessed
(to Dirk) We gotta get out of here
Why
think this girl's flipping out
What could she do to us
Look at her
Dirk takes one look at Needy's face and takes off his guitar
Nikolai motions for the rest of the band to leave the stage
The music stops abruptly
The kids in the gym murmur and complain, confused
() 109
: Needy tries to follow them
She limps blindly toward the stage and climbs up
Everyone watches, gasping in horror
By now the band is disappearing out the side door of the gym
(into the mic) You didn't play your hit yet
But they're gone
Needy looks out at her classmates
They stare back
She '  -  ( ) They found Chip the following morning
The police couldn't find an explanation for the "substance" in the pool, so they chose not to mention it to the press
In fact, they treated the whole incident like a bad dream
'  ( ) - We see the  (including newly minted officer ) informing Chip's mother that his body has been found
She collapses onto the floor, curling up into the fetal position
Trouble was, some of us would never wake up
'  - Needy is lying in bed, shaking, her arm in a cast
Her mother tries to rouse her
never went back to school after that
Didn't talk much either
My mom bought some books so she could teach me at home like crazy Christians with 14 kids do
But wasn't a very cooperative student
Needy pulls the covers over her head
() 110
: Toni shrugs, resigned, and tosses the book on the floor
'  - Needy is crouched outside Jennifer's window, hiding in the shrubbery
She looks almost feral, with wide eyes and a hungry expression
Through the window, we see Jennifer sitting at a vanity and combing her hair, oblivious to the intruder in her yard
What nobody realized was that was doing a different kind of homework
was watching her every night
Waiting
We see Jennifer putting the comb down and examining her hair with a appraising eye
(') Waiting for her to get weak and dull
Waiting for her to burn through the life-force she'd stolen from Chip
Needy creeps away from the window
(') It took weeks, but  finally made my move
Remember
'  - We're seeing a  of the night Needy slaughtered Jennifer
Needy plunging through the window
Jennifer thrashing
The blood
The struggle
The levitation
The arrival of the police
Even in her last moments of life, she somehow managed to be cooler than me
We see, for a moment, Jennifer's sly, challenging smile as Needy raises the boxcutter to slash her
That signature look of mastery and control
() 111
: She left an insanely hot corpse
We see Jennifer's mother holding her again, screaming, though all we hear is  and
Sure enough, Jennifer's bleeding body seems to be artfully, sensually draped in her mother's arms
She almost seems to be at us
" " - We're back in solitary confinement, where Needy has been narrating the whole sordid tale
She hasn't moved a muscle since beginning her story
Only a single shaft of moonlight illuminates the room
An orderly shoves  through a slot in the door
It's a pile of mystery meat
Needy wrinkes her nose
don't even know who Needy Lesnicki is anymore
'm a different person now
person who uses curse words and kicks orderlies and and sees things that aren't there
very bad, very damaged person
Needy reaches up and distractedly pulls back the neckline of her shirt
(') But sometimes, change can be good
For instance, most occult scholars don't know this, but if you're bitten by a demon--and you live-- you just might absorb some of the demon's abilities
In the moonlight, we see Needy still has a infected- looking  near her shoulder
She scratches it, wincing
(') You just might get lucky for once in your miserable life
to reveal that Needy, still cross-legged is five feet off the floor
Effortlessly
With visible concentration, she slowly flies up toward a narrow  positioned up near the ceiling
To anyone with normal abilities, it would be impossible to access
() 112
: Needy reaches the window, gazes at it for a moment, then it with surprising strength
- Needy strolls across the grounds in her bunny slippers
She heads confidently toward the   and passes through it after casually mangling the bars
Only a Needy-shaped hole remains
9 - Needy is striding purposefully down a dark country road
The hospital recedes in the background
few  gather by the side of the road, watching Needy as she walks past
whizzes by with its windows rolled down
"Through the Trees" blasts from the radio
Needy begins to sing, a lopsided grin on her face
() "Through the trees,  will find you
Heal the ruins left inside you
" - Devil's Kettle citizens are gathered around Murphy Pool, crying
It's a   for Chip
Their faces are weary and sorrowful
Photos of Chip have been arranged around the edge of the fence
We see a picture of    on the end
Someone has brought a  player, and the mourners sing along, their voices soaring
() "
And the stars will remind you, we'll meet again
" 9 - Needy holds her thumb aloft as she walks down the remote country highway
() 113
: () "
We'll meet again
" small creek emptying into a stream   runs parallel to the road
Needy seems something glinting   at the mouth of the creek and stoops to pick it up
It's   Nikolai's , the one he threw into Devil's   Kettle, never to be seen again
Needy picks it up and tucks it into her waistband
comes rattling up the road
Needy sticks her thumb out again
The wagon pulls over to the side of the road
The driver, a grizzled older man, rolls down the window
He eyes Needy lasciviously
Where you looking to go, young lady
East, toward Madison
East, huh
Guess 'm headed that way
But 'm gonna need you to pay me in ass, gas or grass
Got that
No free rides in this wagon
don't have any money or drugs, so you'll have to settle for ass
Fair enough
Hop in my chariot
Needy gratefully hurries into the driver's seat
(') So why you headed East
'm following this rock band
Huh
Must be a hell of a group
Tonight's gonna be their last show
() 114
: (2) Needy smiles blithely and pops the clear Lifesaver into her mouth
The station wagon pulls off
As it sputters off into the distance, we see a road sign that reads, ironically, We hear the song on the radio end, segueing into the 's bumper
What a song
Thought we'd play that one in honor of Soft Shoulder
They're playing in Madison tonight
Should be a night to remember
The 's voice fades out as the car vanishes into the horizon
