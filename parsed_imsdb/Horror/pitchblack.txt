"Pitch Black", shooting draft, revised by David Twohy Screenplay by David Twohy Based on material by Ken and Jim Wheat Revised First Draft 3/3/98 : "" :          - "  " Though mentioned often in the script, the creatures in   are seldom seen at length; rather, they are glimpsed, they are heard, they are felt
They are, really, the embodiment of your nocturnal fears:  howling coyote that jars you awake; the painting on the wall that comes to life when stared at too long
the sway of your bed just before the earthquake hits
Chimera of the night
The point is made so the reader appreciates that the focus of the finished film will not be on what the creatures do, but on what the creatures do to reveal the inner nature of the characters
For   is, at its heart, a story of humanity and courage -- and lack of the same
David Twohy : -  , spitting out
She hits the deck of the main cabin: Four crew lockers in a forward section, countless more in back
But the deck is canted at a sick angle and   everywhere: The world is dying around her
Legs wobbly, shivering like a flu victim, Fry stumbles to the next forward locker
It's riddled with holes
One is seen through fractured plexi, body pocked and bloodied
But in the next cryo-locked
The  is struggling awake
Fry's face floods with relief
Slapping an intercom: Hear me
Cap'n
Some kinda compromise to the hull
holding for now, but
Goddamn, 'm glad you're alive
Gotta pull your -release
no, red handle, red handle
'll get the warm-ups out while -- ---: Particles bore through the cabin blasting open the captain's chest, shattering plexi, on the opposite wall and leaving in the air
Fry lands on her ass, horrified
Suddenly
Another
body falls right on top of Fry -- but this one's still alive
Disoriented, frantic: Why did  fall on you
He's dead
Cap'n's dead
Christ,  was looking right at him when -- mean,  mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19
mean,  mean, mean, why did  fall at all You hear me
Captain's dead
Owens too
Oh, no
Not Owens, not
Wai', wai', wait
'm Owens Right
They swap nightmare looks, momentarily unsure of their own identities
Cryo-sleep
Swear to God, it sloughs brain cells
- - They stumble into nav-bay
Fry grabs warm-up suits out of storage, pitches one to Owens, checks her screens
1550 millibars, dropping 20  per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air
Somethin' took a swipe at us
Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane
Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space
Owens activates an exterior view: planet rushes up at us That's why they have gravity
Jesus God
- '  - The   through the upper atmosphere, antennae pylons already disintegrating
Heart battering her ribs, Fry runs forward, using hand-holds to steady herself
Over a headset: (
) They trained you for this, right
Fry
She doesn't answer
- Fry harnesses in, starts running switches -- but fumbles a few times, making mental errors
Finally she gets crash-shutters open to reveal
sweeping up past the windscreen like floor-lights on a dropping elevator
We're shedding big altitude
- - crisis program selected Number Two of this system because it shows at least some oxygen and more than 1,500 -- would you (hammers a button, ) -- more than 1,500-millibars of pressure at surface-level
Okay, so maybe the ship did something right for a change
- As Fry runs more switches
- As    around the ship
- As Fry flips up a security-latch -- and thumbs the switch below
- '  - :   - around the ship's skin, blowing away non-essentials that hinder aerodynamics -- including big deep-space drives
But this last separation puts the ship into a dangerous roll
- Out the windscreen, cloud strata roll vertiginously
Fry throws actuators
- '  - And airbrakes deploy
She manages to kill the roll
But the ship's still coming in nose-high
- - showing no major water bodies
maximum terrain, 220 meters over mean surface
largely cinder and gypsum with some evaporite deposits
behind Owens, segregating him from the passenger compartment
It scares him for a new reason
Fry
What're you doing
- Fry flips up a new security-latch
: Fry
Can't get my nose down
too much load back there
You mean that "load" of passengers
So what, we should both go down too
Out of sheer fucking nobility
Tortured silence
Fry's thumb moves to the switch that will jettison the passenger cabin
Jettison 50 people
of faces inside cryo-lockers, among them
He's prime-of-life, badge on display, some kind of cop
Shaken awake, he clears condensation to check the locker directly across from his, finding
Small black goggles hide his eyes
metal bit wedged in his mouth lends a perpetual grimace
read-out admonishes "- " - Look, Fry
Company says we're responsible for every one of those -- Company's not here, is it
When captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not
Now they train you for this, so -- And there wasn't a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site
That's how they train you
On a fucking simulator
Owens unbuckles from his chair
Don't touch that switch
Overcome by guilt, Fry retracts her thumb of mass destruction
But a   puts the thumb right back
'm not dying for them
She pushes it But this time
- '  - No bolts fire
Nothing separates from the through the clouds
- - Now we see why: Owens reopened the jettison doors locally -- and blocked them open
Owens
70 seconds
You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out
- Seething anger and guilt, Fry pops more airbrakes, shedding more speed, more heat
The ship does level -- but it's still being pounded hellishly
She tries to get a stable view out
The windscreen
We're breaking through cloud-bottoms
There's just a glimpse of landscape before
- '  - An airbrake fails It shears off and pinwheels into
- The windscreen
It cracks into a thousand spiderwebs -- but impossibly it holds
For now
(
) What the shit was that
Sunlight flares from every fractured edge: It's like looking into burning diamonds, and Fry can only get an impression of the outside world
Now she has to rely on
ground-mapping display
120 meters altitude
And dropping
- - Johns
Realizing he's in some kind of shit-storm, he claws at safety restraints
- Ground-mapper: 60 meters
kick in
Out the fractured windscreen, we see a huge dark mass rise up into view
Land 40 meters
30
20
10
Fry braces
The
in
- - Chairs rip from their moorings
Strapped into one, Owens slams into the ceiling
- Johns   of his locker -- and wishes to God he would've stayed inside, because just beside him
The hull is cracking open :  huge section of the cabin tears free
skitters and  along the planetfloor behind us
and disintegrates out of sight
40 cryo-lockers vanished with it
40 lives
- Hammered by , Fry opens her eyes experimentally
' :  vortex of motion, of speed, of blurring debris
But the ship is burrowing in
Burrowing under Fry pivots her chair 180 degrees a nanosecond before
Dirt avalanches into the cockpit It buries
-   - Choking yellow dust
Ghostly silhouettes are , , to other survivors in English and, surreally, in Arabic
Soon we find
Johns
Ears running blood
Stumbling his way to
Riddick's cryo-locker
Empty
Johns reaches for his holster
Gone, torn right off his belt
No prisoner and no weapon -- spooky combination
Nearby he sees
The light of a cutting torch
Someone's using it to open a jammed cryo-locker
The plexi is torched away to reveal
, 12 years old
Unscathed
Somethin' went wrong, huh
Johns searches for his pistol
Behind him, two chained feet lower into -- and then attack, swinging over Johns' head
getting the chain on his neck
twisting hard, using the chain as a choke-collar
Johns flicks open a baton, swings it up at
Riddick
Still in body chains and mouth-bit
Clinging to a ceiling support
Riding out the baton blows
Seconds from blacking out, Johns strains forward
forward
and finally breaks Riddick's grip on the support
He keeps hold of the chained feet so that
Riddick   into the deck
Johns lays the baton on his neck
One chance and you blew it, Riddick
Never cease to disappoint me
-   - Darkness
light beam sweeps the dusty air of the cockpit
It's packed with dirt, no signs of life
About to search elsewhere, Johns turns back at
(
) Hey
Hey, who
(
) Hey, me
Over here
His light finds a headrest sticking up from the dirt
Johns crawls closer, checks the other side of the headrest and finds her
Fry
Buried to the gills
Amazing
'm Johns
Carolyn Fry
'd shake hands, but
He manages a smile and starts digging her out
Almost dreading to ask: Are there any others, Johns
-   - Johns helps Fry through the carnage
She's stunned by it all -- but especially by the blast of sunlight where a hull used to be
Realizing she's in nav-bay, Fry starts digging like a search dog to uncover
Owens
Still strapped to his chair
Metal rod piercing his chest close to the heart
Dead
Fry reaches out to touch him
Out, out, out,
She recoils hard
He's still alive The other survivors bungle over
Ten seconds of pure chaos: Pull it out of him
No, it's too close to the heart
You gotta do it, just do it fast
Fry grabs the rod
Don't touch it
Don't touch that switch
You'll kill him, 'm tellin' you, shit, just leave it alone
delirious
doncha you got some drugs for this poor man
Don't touch that switch
Awright, awright, someone
there's Anestaphine in the med-lock, that end of the cabin
next to
But there is no more "that end
" In exquisite pain, Owens screams on
of Johns, Audrey
Seldom are human beings witness to such raw suffering
Get away
Everybody
The others leave -- except for Audrey, staying behind to watch in morbid fascination
Johns doubles back and collars her
Leaving, they pass
Riddick, cuffed to a bulkhead
His eyes, still hidden by goggles, track Johns and Audrey toward daylight
- The survivors straggle outside
new faces: and
Male-female team of bushwhackers, partners in life
Shazza has a tough sexiness
Zeke's face shows aboriginal blood
(30s
) Overfed, overgroomed
puff pastry of a man
(40s or 50s
) Four male "Chrislams": The pillar-steady  (50ish), and , young and excitable (late-teens)
(: The Chrislams represent a union between Christianity and Islam
They have the iconography of Christians yet the physical look of Arab Muslims
) : All around them is stark and unforgiving terrain
The valley floor is relieved only by low hills to one side, spiked with earthen spires
Scorching down on everything are two suns -- one red, one yellow
Well
Our own little slice of heaven
The Chrislams fall to their knees
Confusion as they try to orient themselves
Please
which way to New Mecca
We must know the direction in order to pray
North
South
East
West
Nobody knows
Johns snaps open a compass, finds the needle swaying rudderlessly
The inside the ship finally ends
- As Fry holds Owens, now dead
- The four Chrislams have devised a way to pray: Backs together, each faces a different compass point
- Fry climbs onto the back of the ship
Johns Paris, Zeke, Shazza, Audrey are already here
Big talk about a scouting party
Fry sees the huge smoldering scar in the ground behind the ship
One glance confirms that there are no other survivors
(') then we saw this
Anyone else having breathing problems
Aside from me
Like  just ran, or something
Feel one lung short
All of us
Well,  tend toward the asthmatic
And with all this dust
Faces turn to Fry: They're looking to her for answers
It's the atmosphere
Too much pressure, not enough oxygen
Might take a few days to -- So what the bloody hell happened, anyways
Somethin' knocked us off-lane
Maybe a rogue comet
Maybe we'll never know
Well,  for one, am thoroughly fucking grateful
This beast wasn't made to land like this
But cripes, you rode it down
(to others) 'mon, you lousy ingrates, only reason we're alive is a'cuzza her
Others  , laying thankful hands on Fry's shoulders
on Fry, her face betraying nothing as they anoint her their savior
-   - Breaking out pressure suits: Liquid oxygen canisters inside
Start ripping them out
Quick hits only -- try to make it last
Well, is someone coming for us
Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse
(off their looks) Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me
We're worried you'll scare us
(ushering her away) Name's "Audrey," right, love
And you're goin' to Taurus Three like we were
Yeah, but
do we even have enough food to get there
Or will we have to resort to cannibalism
(to Fry) 'll see 'bout makin' this air go a bit further, cap'n
With your permission, a' course
Fry blinks
"They actually think 'm the captain
" Zeke and the others get to work
Fry finds herself staring at another problem
Riddick
And him
Big Evil
We just keep him locked up forever
Be my choice
Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on -- don't need his life story
Is he really that dangerous
Only around humans
Riddick has his mouth on the hull, virtually licking the metal
Fry moves closer -- and now sees it sheeting down the hull
Oh, Christ
They're losing water Suddenly Fry is running, snatching up an emergency light, climbing wall-rungs
-   - And crawling through dusty superstructure to reach the water cistern
She opens a crank-hatch -- and finds light invading the interior
Her face dies
(
) (shouting) Well
Is it just the pump
Ask if anyone has anything in cargo
Anything to drink
- Oversize   open
Fry, Johns, and Paris climb into this dark corridor lined with cargo containers
Each container has an access door
Mine here
As Paris unlocks, Johns steadies himself, suddenly light-headed
'matter
Little swamp-flu from the Conga system
Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep
Paris opens his container to reveal
'  -   - Tiffany chairs stacked 10 high
Bronze eagle lecterns
Oriental umbrellas
Neo-Egyptian castings
King Tut's tomb
Be surprised what these will fetch in the Taurus system
Here
This Wooten here -- easy, easy
Very rare
They open the Wooten desk
Cubbyholed inside are dusty bottles of sherry
Vintage Port
Glenfiddich
Bicardi 151
This is it
Booze
That's what you have to drink
(educating her) 200-year-old single-malt scotch is to "booze" as foie gras is to "duck guts
" (cracking a bottle) toast to whatever he just said
'll need a receipt for that
(to Fry) For all these
Top of my list
She joins Johns for a drink
Entering, the Chrislams watch with both envy and aversion
don't suppose
One of the Christian habits we didn't adopt -- perhaps unfortunately
We'll have to wait
For what
There is no water
You understand that, don't you
All deserts have water, somewhere
God shall lead us there
-   - on the cutting torch, abandoned in wreckage
Staring at it is
Riddick
With his hands cuffed behind him and around a bulkhead, he can't get near it
Or can he
Near the ceiling, the bulkhead is fractured -- a slim spot where maybe chains could pass through
Riddick stands
With a  , he dislocates both shoulders
carries his arms overhead
passes the chains through the broken spot
and brings his arms down in front of him body-flex    back into joint
Free, he reaches for the cutting torch
- Pistol in hand, Johns runs into a  , eyes sweeping
Nothing on the horizon
But something lies on the ground nearby
It's Riddick's mouth-bit
Like we needed another way to die
- : Hands pillaging storage lockers, pulling out anything that might qualify as a "weapon
" It all gets hauled back and dumped into
-   - Nav-bay
Gathered, the survivors take inventory: Johns has a pistol, shotgun, baton
Zeke and Shazza offer up a pick-ax, digging tools, hunting boomerang
Imam shows a ceremonial blade
Paris straggles in with antique curios
What the hell are these
Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India
Very rare
An' this
Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea
Very very rare, since the tribe's extinct
'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess
Well, what's the need, anyway
If he's gone, he's gone
Why should he bother us
First, because he can only live out there for so long -- he's gonna come back and take what we got
Second, for the sheer thrill of the kill
beat
They all grab for weapons
- Johns stands atop the crash ship, scanning with a scope
He fixates on
blue glow on the horizon
"What the hell is it
" Zeke and Shazza modify breather units, adding straps and tubing and ball-floats
The prototype is tested on Audrey
She sucks on the mouthpiece -- and finds that it works, supplying oxygen on demand rather than in a constant flow
Chrislams convert to traditional bedouin head-gear, readying for travel
Fry finishes wrapping Owens' body
She looks to the yellow sun, low on the horizon
The red sun seems inclined to follow
Imam
We should leave soon
Before nightfall but while it's cooler
What, you're goin' off, too
Johns is leaving you a gun
Just do me a favor, huh
Get my crewies buried
They were good guys who died bad
'course we will
#1 (
) Imam
Imam
(: "Imam" is pronounced "el-ee-
") Fry and the others round the ship to see
blue star flaring into view It's rising as the other suns are setting
My bloody oath
Three suns
(to Fry) So much for your nightfall
So much for my cocktail hour
We take this to be a good sign -- a path, a direction from God
Johns swings down from the top of the ship
very good sign
(re: blue sun) That's Riddick's direction
You do not wanna be caught in the dark with this guy
Thought you found his restraints over there
Toward sunset
(nodding) Which means he went toward sunrise
- Trekking, the Chrislams waft incense pots and as they head toward the blue star
Johns provides shotgun escort; Fry carries Paris' second war-pick on a shoulder
Silhouetted against the alien sky, the scouting party is an odd, odd sight
Already sun-battered, Johns crafts an eye-visor out of plexi
Fry tries to wrap her head like the Chrislams
Imam helps
So quiet
You get used to the sounds of the ship, then
You know who Muhammad was
Some prophet guy
"Some prophet guy
" And a city man
But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God
You were on a pilgrimage
To New Mecca
(nodding) Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage
To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well
Frightening thought
(finishes wrapping her) We're all on the same hajj now
Fry notices Johns scope-locked on something
What
(hands her scope) Tell me it's not a mirage
: Beyond a distant rise, strange branches
Trees
- Paris has taken over as look-out atop the ship
He deals with the heat by erecting a "misting" umbrella: He fills a reservoir with liquor, dials up a regulator
Umbrella spars shoot bursts of cooling alcohol vapor
Paris luxuriates in it
(
) Comfy up there
Zeke appears below
He loads a scrap-metal sled with tarp, cable, pick-ax
Amazing how you can do without the essentials of life -- so long as you have the luxuries
Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes open
Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up on me bloody-fuckin' arse
He drags the sled toward the spired hills
Keeping one eye on Zeke, Paris eases into a chair, lays the war-pick across his lap, pours himself a spot of sherry
As he sips, a blade touches his throat He'd probably get you right here, right under the jaw
And you'd never hear him coming
That's how good Riddick is
Paris eases the hunting boomerang away
Now did you run away from your parents
Or did they run away from you
- The scouting party approaches a rise
The trees loom just beyond
Allahu Akbar
Allahu Akbar
The young pilgrims break into a excited run, anticipating an oasis
But Fry hangs back, taking a harder look at the trees
They don't move in the wind
The pilgrims scramble up the rise -- and go motionless
Fry, Johns and Imam catch up to behold
The "trees" are actually the dorsal bones of a titanic skeleton, tinted green by lichen
Beyond is a sea of bleached animal bones Impossibly, the bones seem to
All told, it's like Hell overflowed right here
Is this whole planet dead
pilgrim questions Imam
He asks what could have killed so many great things
- Moving into the boneyard: Some
communal graveyard, perhaps
like the elephants of Earth
Fry touches one of the towering bones
It shows cut-marks -- almost as if the bone was hacked by a sword
"Graveyard
Or killing field
" Long time ago
Whatever happened
-  - Pilgrim #1 reaches a huge skull laced with baleen-like combing
Wind hitting the comb makes a
By moving a hand over the comb, the pilgrim can "play" Wanting to show off the trick: #1 Ah
He looks for Pilgrim #3 but can't spot him
And when he turns back to the skull -- a face is staring through the combing But it's only
-  - Pilgrim #3, inside the skull
Johns enters and chases him out
About to leave, Johns notices
Bone-chippings piled on the ground
It could be nothing, but still
Johns double-checks shadows, probing with the muzzle of his shotgun
Satisfied, Johns exits
Now   to reveal
Riddick Hidden in a sinus cavity
-  - Trailing the others, Fry pauses to change out the O2 on her breather
-  - Riddick drops to the ground
His arms and hands are now pierced with shards of boneyard ivory -- fashionable little body talons
Spotting a shadow on the combing, he draws closer
And sees Fry
Alone
-  - Johns doubles back to Fry
He takes a hit of scotch, offers her some
Probably makes it worse
Dehydrates you even more
Probably right
They drink anyway
Moving out of the sun, Fry leans up against the combing
It brings her within arm's length of
-  - Riddick
He pulls a bone-shiv, freshly chiseled
(
) You know,  woulda played road dog for these guys
You could've stayed back
Pro'bly should've -- because, you know, if we don't find water
"We may not make it back
" (
) No, no,  wanted to get away
(
) So  noticed
Never seen a "captain" quite so ready to leave her ship
Just as Riddick eases his blade toward Fry's neck
-  - She steps away
Better keep moving
What'd Owens mean
'Bout not touching the switch
Fry searches his eyes, wondering if she can trust him -- and again she leans back on the combing
We can actually see Riddick now
They could too, if they would just
(') Hey
You can tell me, Carolyn
Promise me
Swear to me you won't -- You see anybody else here
Just between you and me
During the landing
when things were at their worst
Owens was at his best
He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin
Johns blinks, stunned
"Are you shittin' me
" -  - Trying again, Riddick reaches out with his shiv -- and deftly slices off some of Fry's hair
locket
souvenir
That's all he wanted
(
) So now you know
(
) Fuck
Guess 'm more glad to be here than thought
Riddick watches them move off -- then looks at the scotch bottle, left behind
It's still got one good swallow
- Leaving the boneyard, the scouting party reaches a cleft in the hills
Ahead is a canyon
Hold up
He jumps onto a rock, puts the scope to an eye
(') Didn't bite
What
Thought he might be coolin' it in the boneyard -- could either double-back to the ship or slip in behind us
So  left the bottle out as bait
:  the boneyard
the bottle
It's still got that one swallow
(') But nah
Didn't bite
- on the bottle
Only we see that the scotch has been emptied -- and replaced with sand
-   - Working under the shade of a tarp, Zeke digs a communal grave
Three wrapped corpses wait nearby
He keeps a sight-line on
The crash ship
Shazza waves
Zeke waves back
-   - The scouting party transits a narrowing canyon
Lined with rib bones, it makes us feel like we're in the belly of some beast
Fry squints at the ridgetops
More of those spires are visible on the canyon rims, looming like silent sentinels
"What are they
Just mineral deposits
" #1 Captain
captain
The Chrislams have found what appears to be a small desert plant
Leathery petals are spread wide, revealing a round stringy core
Desert fruit
Is it edible
Wait, wait, wait
Fry takes the "plant," pushes the "petals" back down over the core
They all stare
It's a baseball We are not alone here, yes
They look ahead, wondering what awaits them
But Johns is looking back
Never thought we were
- : An old    in the wind
Fry, Johns, and the Chrislams enter  far below
#1 Assalamoo ahlaykum
The   through the settlement, built from stacked shipping containers
Tattered sun-shades flap in the wind rusty bike lies on the ground
#2 Assalamoo ahlaykum
Long gone
Whoever they were
They move around a building -- and pull up short
Before them looms a moisture-recovery unit, a hulking machine in disrepair
Old jugs litter the ground
Water
water there was here
Allahu Akbar
(translating) "God is Great," yes
'm born-again
Fry manages a weary smile -- but soon her eyes revisit the abandoned buildings
"Who were these people
Why did they leave so much behind
" -  - Through a window, we see the Johns and the Chrislams crawling over the moisture-recovery unit, assessing repairs
to include Fry inside the settlement, inspecting
Refectory table
Place settings out
Years of dust
Photos on the wall: Settlers working modest gardens
Playing baseball
Posing with children
-  - Fry enters a dark room
Lights
No response to her command
She pats around for old-style wall switches
Nothing
Perceiving black-out blinds on a window, she throws them open to reveal
man standing right outside (through window) Hey
Don't go too far, huh
Fry nods
Johns smiles, leaves
Just as her heart settles, behind her
It's an orrery, a mechanical device that shows the motion of the planets around their suns
Solar powered, the orrery starts turning,
One planet seems always to have sunlight
No darkness
No lights because no darkness
-  - Fry reaches a porch
It looks out over the rear of the settlement and more unforgiving terrain
She starts back inside -- but something glints at the edge of her vision
Fry turns back
parts clothes on a laundry line
and sees the source of the glint
Excited hits on her breather
Fry vaults off the porch -- and starts walking as if on magnetic bearing
Soon she's running
- (
) Allahu Akbar
Allahu Akbar
Johns and the Chrislams trade looks
- Allahu Akbar
Fry stops on a groomed runway, out of breath
The others catch up
They too marvel at
The skiff , a light-duty vehicle of hybrid technology -- part bush plane, part space craft
Its fabric wings are wind-torn -- but the hull looks intact
- on caviar being added to toast-points
stops Paris in mid-bite
He eases out of his rocker, moves to the rear edge of the ship and looks down on
shadow ducking under him
Small rocks still trickle down a dirt rampart just climbed by
someone
This now qualifies as the worst fun 've ever had
Stop it No response
- War-pick in hand, Paris eases to ground-level
He checks the perimeter, looks inside the ship
Nobody
Is he being fucked with
Again
He hopes
Audrey
Oh, Audrey
(
) What Paris spins
The voice came from the cargo hold -- and not where he expected
- Blades of sunlight stream in through cracks in the hull
Paris enters to find Shazza and Audrey cutting open containers, searching for usable goods
Tell me that was you
Okay, it was me
What'd  do now
Assailing my fragile sense of security, that's what
What're you goin' on about
She's been right here for the last
They all see it: Sun-blades are momentarily blocked by something passing outside
Some one (a quiet probe) Zeke
No answer
Audrey springs to the other side of hold, puts an eye to a crack there
- : Far away, Zeke finishes digging the grave
He starts toward the ship
Audrey whirls back, mouths a silent alarm: "
" Paris goes bloodless
Shazza grabs the war-pick out of his frozen hands, moves catlike to the main doors and poises there, ready to strike
Audrey follows with the hunting boomerang
All eyes watch as
The sun-blades, winking off and on, chart Riddick's approach: We feel like we're inside a magician's sword box, watching the blades shave closer and closer to us
Suddenly he appears And Shazza swings hard
No
Facing them is a   -- burned, half naked, one hand still clutching the emergency-release lever of his cryo-locker
Shazza stopped one inch short of killing him
thought
my God,  thought  was the only one who
He lurches toward Shazza, trying to embrace her -- and sees blood and brain-bits - against her
His own The stranger sinks bonelessly to the ground
to reveal Zeke in the background, pistol leveled
He reads Shazza's horrified face -- and understands what he's done
Oh, Lord
It was just somebody else
From the crash
He was just
Cripes galore,  thought it was him
The murderin' ratbag
thought he was
He rushes over to check the dead stranger
As he bends down, to reveal Riddick in the background He stands 20 paces off, still unseen by the others
His goggle eyes covet
Zeke's breather
- Fry exits the skiff
No juice, looks like it's been laid up for years
But we might be able to adapt -- Shut up
Outside, Johns has an ear cocked to the wind
(') Sorry
Thought  heard something
Like what
Like my pistola
-   - on the drag-sled carrying Corpse #4-- the stranger
Zeke reaches the grave
The sun-tarp has fallen on one side, blocking the sight-line between ship and grave
Zeke starts to unload the body -- but sees something he didn't notice before: There's some kind of opening at the bottom of the grave
Now what the bloody hell
Zeke hops down into the grave
to reveal Riddick hidden among the spires
He's been waiting for a chance just like this
- Zeke drops to all fours
Looks into the tunnel
There seems to be some kind of burrow beyond
: Staring back at Zeke
Zeke takes a handlight off his belt, shines it into the burrow
It's the last thing he ever does
/
- As   jar Paris, Audrey, Shazza
- : Zeke fighting for his life
Something slashing at him
Blood dancing on air
- Shazza sprints across hard-pack, heading for
-   - The grave
She slaps aside the tarp to find
Riddick
Bone-shiv in hand, he just stands on the other side of the grave
Shazza looks down
And
- Riddick as he lopes through the spires, running from the scene of the crime
He turns a blind corner -- and at close range
He hits ground
boot steps on his neck, keeping him there
Same crap, different planet, huh
- Sucking on their breathers, Fry and the Chrislams make it back to the ship
They find Johns beating Riddick like a chained dog
don't play that
don't play that so just try again
'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie
Ease up, ease up
Just tell me what
She hauls him off -- only to have Shazza start punching Riddick
What'd you do with 'im
You bloody sick animal you, what'dja do with me Zeke
-   - Fry and Johns stand over the grave
It's a gory mess -- but no sign of Zeke
Johns has Riddick's confiscated shiv
He used that
Sir Shiv-a-lot
He likes to cut
So why isn't it all bloody
assume he licked it clean
-   - Riddick is back in chains, face pulpy from the beating, listening to    outside
Fry enters, looks at him hard
So where is he
Riddick turns away, revealing a broken goggle-lens
The eye beneath is closed: For some reason, he won't look at her
Tell me about the sounds
You told them you heard something right before
(no response) If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull
'Mean the whispers
What whispers
The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down
The abdominal aorta
What a gusher
Had a cup on his belt, so  used it to catch a little run-off
Metallic taste to it, human blood
Coppery
But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away
Course, that's more for winter
Summertime,  take mine straight
Fry stares
Riddick gets a black satisfaction from his role as Boogeyman: If fear is the only kind of respect he can get, Riddick is going to grab some with both hands
Why don't we try the truth now
head-shaking beat, then: All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, 'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now
Show me your eyes
Again he turns away
She strips the goggles off
He sits with lids shut tight, anticipating the pain
Show me , Riddick
Imagine a virgin undressing in front of someone for the first time
That's how Riddick opens his eyes, startling us: No irises, just huge black-pool pupils
And from deep within, a jewel-like eyeshine
His eyes are as beautiful and unsettling as those of a starved jaguar
You did this
To yourself
Slam doctor
Well, we called him "doctor
" Heard about it
Just never seen it
Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say
Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here
Three ass-kick suns
(replacing goggles) Maybe  did do a few people
But not this one
No ma'am, not this time
Then where is he
He's not in the hole
We looked
Look deeper
He    at her
- Chain looped over one shoulder, Fry heads back to the grave site
Johns, Imam, Shazza, and Audrey keep pace as
know what happened -- he went off on the guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and now he's trying to -- Let's just be sure
am sure
Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame
He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has
And you're playing right into -- We're gonna find the body , Johns
Christ, you're a cop
Why am  tellin' you this
We gotta go down and find it
Well, don't ask me to
Thought you didn't believe his story
don't
But that ground looked none too stable, and  don't want anyone -- If you're afraid, 'll go
He shoots Audrey a scowl
Nobody else is going down but me, okay
(pulling her aside) Hey
Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid
What, you think 'm doin' this to prove something
You said it, not me
Let's just not let one bad call lead to another
Thanks for the tip, Johns
"Now get outta my way
" - Chain hooked to her web belt, Fry drops into the grave
She peers into the burrow
looks back up at the halo of faces above her
then slithers out of sight
- Letting her eyes adjust, Fry pats around lightly
Quickly she finds Zeke's handlight, tries it
Broken
- -   - on the chain slithering through hands, playing out as Fry moves deeper underground
- Fry makes an uphill turn
Sees a spray of light ahead
Worms forward to reach
- Another chamber, wide and just large enough to stand in
Shafts of daylight bore down into the room
More old bones litter the floor
Fry moves into one shaft and looks up at
An earthen funnel
The inside of a spire
They're hollow
-
Fry slow-turns toward the sound
--
There's something here , something just beyond the cusp of light
Something unfolding
An icy hand grips her heart
Soundlessly, Fry backtracks her chain, but
Something shadows across the exit It stops her cold
Her hand finds something new
She angles it to the light
It's one of Zeke's boots -- with a bit of Zeke still in it --
The whole chamber is coming alive around her, shadows unfurling, skulking the perimeter, circling
Something impales the boot out of her hand , reclaiming it
It was faster than a lightning-strike
paralyzed beat before
Fry makes her move, rolling back into the shaft of daylight and springing straight up into
- The spire
Bracing against the walls, Fry tries to "walk" her way up -- but her chain goes taut
Did it catch on something
Or did something catch it Fry starts pounding the earthen walls
Here
'm in , ,
- -   - Did you hear
They drop down and suspend their heads over the bloody grave, listening
Nothing now
- 'm over here in the -- Something tugs on her chain
Oh, God
on her feet
Kicking hard at the walls, trying to gouge out footholds
stronger tug
Fry loses altitude, slipping closer to
The    below
She tries to jettison her belt -- but can't brace herself up and undo the belt
Suddenly
Something explodes near her head Daylight appears, followed by faces, human faces
They're breaking through the spire with the pick-ax
Hands reach inside
- and birth her into daylight
Overlapping: We got you
it's okay, it's okay
we got you now
The child heard you before any of us could even
Did you find him
You find Zeke
(half insane) wasn't Riddick
it was
it was
goddamn, that was stupid
but wasn't Riddick
Somethin' else down there that got Zeke and nearly got -- Her She flies back into the spire
Something's still got the chain The others grab at flailing limbs
It's a tug-of-war now, human hands on one end, unseen "hands" on the other -- and the humans are losing
Until
Imam unsheathes his blade
And slices through Fry's belt
- As the chain falls down the spire
Without Fry
/
- : Survivors packing up O2, liquor, umbrellas, the Koran -- whatever qualifies as "essential" on this planet
Amid the activity, Audrey pauses to look at
The spired hills
-   - Fry and Imam pull a power cell from the ship's battery bay, it down on the deck
One is all
For now
- At his personal locker, Johns digs out a box of shotgun shells
He bypasses the blue-metal shells for a red-metal one
There's something special about it -- though what, we can't be sure
-   - shadow falls over Riddick
He doesn't look up
Found somethin' worse than me, huh
We're movin'
And 'm just wondering if shouldn't lighten the load right now
Now their eyes meet
Johns    and points it at Riddick's head
Woof, woof
The
off of Johns to show Riddick still alive
The shotgun discharged next to his head and blew off his wrist chains
Want you to remember this moment, Riddick
The way it coulda gone and didn't
(deaf) Say that again
Here's the deal
You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs
You help us get off this rock
For what
The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell
Truth is, Riddick, 'm tired of this head-up shit
wanna be free of you as much as you wanna be free of me
beat
The future rearranges in Riddick's head
You'd cut me loose, Boss
Only if we both get outta this alive
And there may be a way
He offers a hand to help Riddick up, to seal the deal
(staring at hand) My recommendation: Do me
Don't take the chance that 'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass
Ghost me, Riddick
Would if  were you
If you were me, 'd kill us both
'mon, you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not
beat
Riddick reaches out for the hand -- and grabs the shotgun with his off-hand blur of movement
Suddenly Johns is staring at the eyes of his own shotgun
Want you to remember this moment
He pumps shotgun, spitting blue shells over Johns
He drops the emptied gun and walks away
- : Blue sun setting, yellow and red sun rising
The survivors trek for the settlement
Fry and Imam lug the power cell between them, but the real load is shouldered by
Riddick
Promoted from murderous monster to beast of burden, he tows a drag-sled heavy with cargo
(to Johns) So just like that
Wave your little wand and he's one of us now
Didn't say that
But least this way don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up
Well,  feel we owe Mr
Riddick amends
Oh, right
Let's all line up and beg his forgiveness
Right you are
At least give the man some oxygen
He's happy just bein' vertical
Leave him be
So  can talk to him now
/ (in unison) No Paris drops a wine bottle
Trailing, Riddick collects it
Paris
Ogilvie
Antiquities dealer, entrepreneur
(shaking hands) Richard
Riddick
Escaped convict, murderer
Instead of returning the bottle, Riddick opens it and drinks
Paris hurries to catch up to the others
You know, if  owned Hell and this planet
believe 'd rent this out and live in Hell
- ' : Of spires high above us
The group falls silent as they transit the canyon, all eyes on the spires
Fry stops short, hearing
-
Neck hairs rise -- but soon the sound vanishes
The group starts moving again, faster
--
Are they being stalked
Nervously, Fry traces the sound back to
Beads dangling from the belt of Pilgrim #1
Whenever he moves, the   together
- mean, usually  can appreciate antiques, but, uh
The survivors have reached the settlement
Fry is trying to get the power cell aboard the skiff as the others walk its exterior
Little ratty-ass
Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts
Not a star-jumper
Doesn't need to be
Use this to get back up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick out a thumb
You'll get picked up
(to Fry) Right
Fry looks from Riddick to Johns
"How did he know that
" Little help here
They muscle the power cell aboard
Riddick starts to follow, but Johns blocks
He doesn't want Riddick inside
Check those containers for me
See what we can patch wings with
- With religious fervor, the Chrislams are repairing the moisture- recovery unit -- the machine Allah led them to
- on the battery bay
Hands are adapting the power cell to the skiffs older electrical system
Soon
Lights wink on throughout the ship
Okay, that should buy us a sys-check
But we'll need more cells
How many
15 6-gigs here
90 gigs total
other ship carries 20-gig cells, so
five
Five total to launch
25 kilos each, huh
Old sand-cat outside
See if  can't get it up and chuggin'
Do it
And if you need an extra hand, tap our problem child out
(looking out) Where's Riddick
- He's walking the ghost town, finding dead gardens
upended chairs and furniture
broken skylights
Behind his back
Audrey and Pilgrim #3 (the youngest Chrislam) scurry through , stalking this curious monster in their midst
-  -  - on the other Chrislams, faces charged with anticipation while awaiting
The first drop of water
It appears at the bottom of a pipette
Tongues fight for it
Another drop forms in its place
Now another and another
It brings
-  - on Paris' hands
Getting ready to celebrate, he unwraps crystal goblets
dusts off the refectory table
and rehangs an old Christmas garland
-  - Hands digging in dirt
Covertly, Audrey and Pilgrim #3 watch Riddick digging near the entrance of a tall windowless structure
He excavates a pair of broken eyeglasses
a shattered light
and a child's tin robot, timeless
Riddick thumbs a solar panel clean
The robot's language program warbles to life: "
to all intruders
am the guardian of this land
will protect my masters at all cost
Death to all intruders
" Riddick stands and tries the doors
Locked
He peers through a small filthy window
Is there something moving inside
Nothing now
Riddick removes some windblown trash from a doorside sign
"Coring Room
" (
) Missin' the party
'mon
It's Johns, keeping him on a short leash
Leaving, Riddick kicks a trash bin
Hard
Missin' the party
'mon
He leaves
on the trash bin a beat
(
) Talkin' to me
- ' : Of Audrey exiting the trash bin and running after Riddick and Johns
Pilgrim #3 is at the window of the coring room
He's found a way inside
By the window's feeble light, he starts exploring
Just visible at the center of this room is a vertical coring drill
-  - and for this, our gift of drink, we give thanks in the name of our Prophet, Muhammad, peace be upon him, and to our Lord, Jesus Christ of Nazareth, and to his father, Allah the Compassionate and the Merciful
(to himself) The strangest religion
Pilgrims finish pouring cloudy water into goblets
Riddick gets the last of it -- the part with sediment
as they drink
Nothing ever tasted finer
Perhaps we should toast our hosts
Who were these people, anyway
Miners
Looks like geologists
Advance team, moves around from rock to rock
Musta crapped out here, huh
But why did they leave their ship
Silence
It's a question no one has chosen to deal with yet
Imam notices one water glass unspoken for
- on the "Coring Room" sign
An attached solar panel begins moving, orienting toward sunlight
When it catches the full brunt of the suns' rays
unlatch on the roof
- Pilgrim #3 hears   overhead
That sound brings another sound:  strange
The pilgrim looks up
Is there something in the rafters
-  - (answering Audrey) Well, just a skiff
Disposable, really
Like an emergency life-raft, right
Sure
Coulda had a real drop-ship take them off-planet
Long gone
toast to their ghosts, then
Goblets rise
Didn't leave, these people
Whatever got Zeke got them
They're all dead
It's like he just pissed in the punchbowl
(') What, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines
Photos on the walls
Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know
know you don't uncrate your emergency ship unless there's a fucking emergency
Rag it, Riddick
Nobody wants your theories on -- (to Riddick) So what happened
Where are they, then
Fry is the only one willing to look at reality -- or at least glance its way
At the window, Imam scans outside
Has anyone seen the young one
Ali
(to Fry and Imam) Has anyone checked the coring room
- Now the storm shutters start yawning open, spreading daylight over Pilgrim #3 and
The ceiling rafters
They're encrusted with thick nests of
something
The  grows louder, more agitated
Sensing trouble, Pilgrim #3 hurries for a sliver of daylight in a wall -- the breach he entered through
He never gets there: Sunlight hits the first nest
It
/
-  - As Imam hears the
Ali - : More   into individual creatures, winged hatchlings moving like bats in a fire, talons hacking and slashing
His exit blocked, Pilgrim #3 veers into
dark supply room
He slams the door,    and waits for the storm to pass
He's been cut -- but at least he's still alive
- As the survivors run for the coring room
-  - As Riddick stays behind to drink their water
- The door caves in
Imam shoulders past Johns to enter and find
The empty coring room
Ali
from the supply room
Is it Ali
Just too scared to come out
Imam opens the door
And hatchlings pour out Moving with a gang-intelligence, they circle the room in a wave, soar high into the rafters -- then plunge into the coring shaft, to infinity
Shocked silence, then
Pilgrim #3 tumbles to the ground
He's been shredded into bloody kite-tails
There was a nest inside the supply room
Imam falls on him in grief
Johns and Fry inch forward to peer down
The coring shaft
It's littered with human bones
The skeletons of the settlers
Scattered about and picked clean
- Against a blue sunrise, the Chrislams hold a prayer service
Paris and Audrey attend
Riddick watches from afar
- Why was the door chained up
Why the bloody hell would they lock themselves in like that
Not sure, but tell you what: Chrislams better not be diggin' another grave out there
(
) Other buildings weren't secure
They turn
Riddick enters
(') so they ran here
Heaviest doors
Thought they'd be safe inside, but
(looks down shaft) Someone forget to lock the back door
Shazza joins him at the shaft
Gazing on the human remains: So that's what come of me Zeke
An' you saw it
You was right there
Riddick nods
(') You were tryin' to kill him too
(shrugging, "not necessarily" Just wanted his -2
(a beat) Though  notice he tried to ghost my ass
When he shot up that stranger instead
Shazza can't deny it
She looks at him differently now, the man she once beat while in chains
She takes off her breather
Take it
(suspicious) What, it's broken
Startin' to acclimate, anyhow
Take it
Riddick accepts it awkwardly, sucks down some pure O2
Johns watches the exchange closely, not much liking the idea of Riddick being promoted to oxygen-breathing human
(to Fry) Let's board this up and get the hell gone
They seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be all -- 60 years ago
Wha'
Coring samples line the room, laid out on counters
Fry's been scrutinizing them
Core-samples are dated
Last one is 60 years ago
This month
Yeah
What's special about that
Dunno
Maybe nothing, but
But now Fry remembers
-  - The orrery
The year-counter clicks over to "45" as
Fry opens the drive box and starts turning the main gear, accelerating the orbits
on the counter
"56
57
58
59
60
" They all see it:  giant ringed world eclipses the suns and plunges their planet into darkness
Persistent darkness
Are you fuckin' kidding me
Not afraid of the dark, are you
- Crossing the yard in wide strides: need those cells from the crash ship
Shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings -- Let's wait on the power cells
Wait for what
Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to -- We're not sure when it happens, so let's not -- Get the fucking cells over here , Johns
What's the discussion
beat
Ever tell you how Riddick escaped
- Alone inside the skiff, Johns and Fry continue with more privacy
(jarred) He can pilot
Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore  tracked him down
(with faint hope) Okay, maybe that's a good thing
Maybe can use him to help with -- He also figured out how to kill the pilot, Fry
mental shiver
You said we were going to trust him now
You said there was a deal
That's what  said
He challenges her to read his mind
Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy
Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free
But if he stops believin' -- You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over
(') -- we need a fail-safe
Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we know we're ready to launch
Fry looks at him with new eyes
You know, he hasn't harmed any of us
Far as  can tell, he hasn't even lied to us
Just stick to the deal, Johns
Let him go if that's what it -- He's a murderer
The law says he's gotta do his bid
Shaking her head, she looks off
Dancin' on razor blades here
won't give him a chance to grab another ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat
-  - Johns descends the gangway -- and finds Riddick erecting a field table in the shade of the skiff
He seems out of earshot
Now, anyway
As they trade looks, another flu-like shiver runs through Johns
Bad sign
Shakin' like that in this heat
Johns moves on
The Chrislams appear, shouldering a roll of Vectran (wing-fabric material)
They drop it on the table
Ready to cut bindings, Imam pats his hip for the knife that was just there
(looking after Johns) 'll cut
He has the knife
- As Shazza and Audrey repair the sand-cat
- on the knife slicing through the Vectran
Riddick hands the trim to Pilgrim #1
as he scampers onto the skiff
balance-beams over wing-struts
and delivers the piece to Imam, who stitches the fabric like an old Berber rug-weaver
Pilgrim #1 pauses to check on
The setting blue sun
Nothing unusual
Yet
- The hatch closes, seals
on a monitor
"  " is underway
Fry scans rising pressure gauges
(
) Looks like we're a few shy
Fry whirls
Riddick is aboard , staring at the depleted battery bay
And he has Imam's blade
(') Power cells
They're coming
Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet
(half-beat) Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape
got the quick-and-ugly version
An' now you're worried about a repeat of history
Entered our minds
asked what you thought
You scare me, Riddick
That's what you wanna hear, isn't it
There,  admit it, Can  get back to work now
She finds the courage to turn her back on him
Riddick moves closer -- and takes a beat to scan the controls
The cabin pressure builds
Think Johns is an do-right man
You think  can trust him to cut me loose
beat
Does Riddick already know
Is he testing her
Why, what'd you hear
Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd just do me, huh
Then again
am worth twice as much alive
(reading her face) Didn't know
Johns ain't a cop
Oh, he's got that shiny badge an' all, but nah -- he's just a merc and 'm just a payday
That's why he won't kill me
The creed is greed
It knocks her off stride, but
Save it, Riddick
We aren't gonna turn on each other -- no matter how hard you try
Riddick moves right up behind her
don't truly know what's gonna happen when the lights go out, Carolyn -- but do know that once the dyin' starts, this little psycho family of ours is gonna rip itself apart
So you better find out the truth
Come nightfall, you better know exactly who's standing behind you
monitor chirps the news: "  --100%
" , the hatch opens automatically
Oh, ask him 'bout those shakes
And ask why your crew-pal had to scream like that 'fore he died
-  - : Hands select a red-metal shotgun shell from a box
pull the shell open
remove a glass ampule hidden inside
drop the ampule into a injection syringe
The syringe touches an eager arm vein
(
) Who are you
Really
Shirt off, Johns looks up
She's in the doorway
(') You're not a real cop, are you
Just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like -- never said  was
Never said you were a hype, either
She moves closer
Rummages through his stuff brazenly
Finds a shitload of red shells with the hidden ampules
You have a little caffeine in the morning, have a little morphine
So what
And here you got two mornings every day
Wow, were you born lucky
Not a problem unless you're gonna make -- (lashing) You made it a problem when you let Owens die like that
When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team
Owens was already dead
His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact
Anything else we should know about you, Johns
Christ, here  am lettin' you play games with our lives when -- He catches her hands -- and moves them around his body, forcing her into an embrace
We understand why when we see a of her hands: They find a jagged purple scar beside his spine
My first run-in with Riddick
Went for the sweet-spot and missed
They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there
can feel it, sometimes, pressing against the cord
(giving her hands back) So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business
You coulda helped
And you didn't
, we hear the Chrislams   and calling for "Captain, Captain
" Yeah, well, look to thine own ass first
Right, "captain"
It cuts deep
- Fry and Johns move outside
The others have gathered, all eyes gang-locked on
An arch in the sky Luminous, ominous, it grows from the horizon
What do my eyes see
It's starting
They watch hypnotically as the arch rises, inching toward the two suns
Shazza shakes out of the trance first
(to Fry) If we need anything from the crash ship -- suggest we kick on
That sand-cat's solar
- : Shazza cranking the sand-cat
hands snatching up lights, water, ropes
Chrislams piling aboard the sand-cat
'
Sand-cat moving
Riddick jumping onto the rear bed
Paris and Audrey running, catching up
We stay together
'mon
-  - Johns doubles back, grabs his shotgun shells, swings out the door
-  - and catches up to the sand-cat
Riddick reels him aboard
Don't wanna miss this
Lookit
Lookit
They turn back to see the rim of a giant planet
It's cresting over the horizon
The luminous arch is the planet's rings
-   - The sand-cat storms through the canyon
As it passes through the massive ribcage
The     some low-bridge bones
- The sand-cat reaches the crash ship
Bodies leap off
Paris steals a look at
The rising planet
It threatens to blot out suns, sky, universe
-   - Johns yanks the first power cell and starts dragging it over the deck
Riddick yanks a second cell and, carrying it on his shoulder, passes Johns with a suck-my-ass grin
Johns shoulders his cell and stumbles after
- Shazza wheels the sand-cat around, getting clearance between it and the ship
The Chrislams lash a scrap-metal sled to the sand-cat
Riddick drops the first cell onto the sled, Johns the second
They're racing the eclipse and each other
- As the rings of the planet eclipse the yellow sun
- It's like God just closed a blind: Daylight dims
The change in light brings a  -
Don't stop, don't stop
But Paris can't help himself
He squints to see
- The spires
seems to come from there
- As the rings eclipse the red sun
- second darkness sweeps over the survivors
Now they all stop, beholding
- Something pouring from the spire-tops
Backlit by coronal light, it first seems to be smoke or ash -- but soon we realize these are living things,     over their first nightfall
- Jesus, how many can there
They keep coming, filling the sky with thick waves
Mercifully, the hatchlings seem to be moving away
But now one wave cleaves from another -- and does a quick about-face
Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee
Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold
lesgo, lesgo, lesgo
They run
Reach the cargo hold
Turn back to see
Riddick and Shazza still coming
Hearing the descending on them
Riddick and Shazza hit to the dirt
Hatchlings torrent just inches overhead
on Shazza
Horrified
Hard to breathe
Like being underwater
on Riddick
He watches in awe, no more frightened that a kid lying on his back looking up at the stars
Experimenting, he eases a bone-shiv into the hatchlings
Instantly it's whittled down to nothing
It's like a river of razor blades The hatchling keep coming
Shazza whips a panicky look at the cargo hold
Can she make it
Should she even try
Tell her to stay there
Stay down
,
Shazza starts worming toward the cargo hold
Suddenly the hatchings vanish
beat
Is it safe
Shazza gets to her feet
No, no, , ,
and the wave is back, enveloping Shazza /
- Standing in the mouth of the cargo container, the others get a last glimpse of Shazza as she flies by the doors, caught up in the funnel-cloud of hatchlings
Then she's simply gone
- Still on the ground, Riddick checks left and right like someone about to cross a busy street
Now he gets up, smacks his hands clean, strolls for the hold
Behind him
rising -
on Fry
She knows the sound better than anyone
- The spires are crumbling, torn down from within
- Reaching the cargo hold, Riddick turns around for one last look
as he sheds goggles -- and looks at the world with his jaguar eyes
' : In degraded image, we see the predators -- adult hatchlings -- emerge from the spires
They're large, mammalian, hammer-headed
They  with echo-location, sounding out the world they haven't inhabited in 60 years
What is it
What's happening
' : The predators launch from the hills, gliding, , searching
Like  said
Ain't me you gotta worry about
- The rim of the planet overtakes both suns
The world goes dark
- Vault-like
The survivors are locked inside the only secure part of the ship
Somehow they've been reduced to neanderthals huddling in their cave, listening to the howls of the sabertooths
What if
what if she's still out there
still alive
Well,  don't want to jump to conclusions here
but 'member that boneyard
These just might be the fuckers that killed every other living thing on this planet, okay
Chances of Shazza knockin' on that door anytime soon are just about zero squared
(agreeing) saw the cut-marks on the bones
Wasn't a natural die-off
Quiet, please
Everyone
Imam is listening at the cargo door
The others pile up alongside, ears tuned like radar
outside
(whispering) Why do they do that
Make that sound
Perhaps the way they see
With sound, reflecting back
(realizing) Echo-location
That's what it is
Now   -- behind them
Lights whip around to find
Nothing
Only the door of an open container about halfway down the tunnel-like hold
volley of looks
"How the fuck could one get in here
" Breach in the hull
dunno
More
Johns realizes they expect him to check it out
'd rather piss glass
Well, you got the big gauge
Wanna rag your fat mouth
Maybe it's just their beads again
Imam, are you still -- No, no, no,  do not believe -- 'mon, man, you're drivin' everybody bugfuck with those things
Why don't you just lose the goddamn
More  -- along with the sound of
Big beads
Butching up, Johns sucks on his breather and shimmies toward
The open container
Leading with his shotgun, he  blindly around the door
Something  -- then silence
Johns eases his head and a light around the door to spot
Hatchlings on the ground, blasted into dog food
(to others) Okay
We're okay
Just some small ones that musta -- Something  for his head , swinging like a scythe
It catches his shotgun,  , giving us
flash-image of an adult predator
Up close
In one thin second, Johns is back with the others
Very big beads
Not staying in here another
He goes for the main-door lever, ready to flee into the night
Fry lunges for him
Christ, you don't know what's out there
know what's in here
Everybody come, this way and we should be safe
Hurry, please
-   - Imam shepherds them into a container
The door slams closed
At first, only the sound of
Then a Johns fumbles with a cutting torch
Gets it burning
Adjusts the gasses to illuminate
The door
Scythe-like blades are probing joints
Suddenly drive everyone back
(to Johns) Can you do sumpin' else with that
'Sides holding it in my fucking face
Taking the hint, Johns starts cutting the common wall between containers
It's a race between the sparks of his cutter and the blades of the predators
-   - An burn-outline appears in the common wall
Johns kicks out the escape hatch
Audrey speed-crawls through first as
-   - Predators shred into the container right behind them, , sweeping, hunting
/  -   - : Again and again, they burn a new escape hatch just as the predators break into the container being vacated, always entering darkness
-   - Inside their fifth container now, Johns torches away
Fry and Paris use cargo to block the entrance hole -- then block the cargo with their bodies
Riddick adds his weight -- until he notices pepper-shot in the cargo
Suspecting the worst, he leaves the others behind
Hello, hello
and moves to the front of the container where darkness prevails
Something  underfoot
He slips off goggles
' : Of dead hatchlings on the floor
This is the open container , the one where Johns found predators
Sensing energy, Riddick lifts his face
' : Of an adolescent predator
It squats atop cargo, eating a hatchling
heavy bone-blade crowns its skull
Sensing Riddick, it sweeps the area with
: Of Riddick
(: The   is a crude image that gives impression without detail
We're "seeing" what the predator hears with echo-location
Think of a sonagram that strobes and wraps its subject in 3- space
) Oblivious, the others kick out the new escape hatch
Audrey, Fry, and Johns worm through
Imam and Pilgrim #2 hang back
"Where's Riddick
" He's in a stare-down with a predator Searching, Pilgrim #2 rounds a corner -- and finds his head caught in a vice-like grip
Don't
Move
' : As a second predator appears above them
This one reaches down with its scythe blade
And gently probes the two men
It wants know what they're made of
on the pilgrim's shoes
Over-running with piss
More blades descend, moving over them like surgical instruments
One test-slices Riddick's shirt
-   - In the next container, Fry waits anxiously
Hissing through the escape hatch: Imam
Where are they
-   - on a predator's scythe blade
It test-slices the pilgrim's skin
Blood wells up
All
(
) Hasan
(
) Riddick
on the pilgrim -- more scared now that the clicking has stopped
Losing his nerve, he bolts
No
The predators are on him , just blurs in the dark
-
' : third predator appears above him
Making his move, Riddick darts around cargo and heads for the escape hatch as
Fry's light catches him square in the face
Blinded, Riddick and stumbles forward
Fry's light leaps deeper to hit
The predator right behind him With a similar reaction, the beast  and flails back
on Fry for a time-stopped moment
What stopped it
Was it really her
Suddenly a   beside her head
Jacked up, Johns is  shadows
Stop it, stop it,
'Sokay, 'sokay
killed it
They give him a look
"Sure you did
" Suddenly a to the floor , sending everyone jumping back in a perfect splash- pattern
"Christ, he did kill one
" Fry reclaims her dropped light and beams it on the carcass
Wherever the light strikes it, the flesh chars and steams
There
Like the light is scalding it
It hurts them
Light actually hurts them
from the two
adolescents, fighting over the scraps of the pilgrim
Is that
Hasan
Riddick nods
We'll burn a candle for him later
'mon
-   - Cargo has been shoved against the door and walls
The survivors gather around Fry's handlight
Audrey -- tough little Audrey -- has been reduced to a shivering lump of mush
one cutting torch
one handlight here, two more in the cabin think two more
Spirits
Anything over 45 proof burns well
How many bottles
Not sure
Ten
Those umbrellas, the ones that mist
Would they burn
(reading his face) If you got a receipt
Possibly
Awright
So maybe we'll have enough light
Enough for what
Now she challenges him to be the mind-reader
(') Oh, lady
If you're in your right mind, pray you go insane
(to others) We can stick to the plan
If we get four cells back to the skiff, we're off this rock
hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at night
We'll have to carry the cells
drag them
whatever it takes
Troubled faces
Is it just our imagination
Or is the light on the floor growing dimmer
You mean
tonight
With all those things still out there
Oh, sure
Why not
Sounds like a hoot
Back it up
How long can this last
Few minutes
Couple hours
No one knows for sure
had the impression
from the model
that the two planets were moving as one
That there would be
a lasting darkness
Those suns gotta come back sometime And if these animals really are phobic about light, we just sit tight till then
'm sure that's what someone else said
Locked inside that coring room
persuasive thought
Eyes swing back to Audrey
Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially
How scared is she gonna be out there
Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen
Smoke screen for what
For your own fear
(eyes narrowing) Hey
Why don't you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that doesn't involve
Two seconds pass
How much you weigh, Johns
What the hell's it matter
How much
79 kilos
Because you're 79 kilos of gutless white meat, and that's why you can't come up with a better plan
He makes a move for her
Riddick blocks
Johns' shotgun bumps the underside of Riddick's chin
Think about that reward, Johns
'm willing to take a cut in pay
How 'bout a cut in your gut
Johns looks down
to reveal the shiv Riddick holds, poised for evisceration
Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this
Please
this solves nothing
please
Johns backs off first
The light grows dimmer
(to Audrey) They're afraid of our light
That means we don't have to be so afraid of them
And you're certain you can find the way back
Even in the dark
No, 'm not
But he can
She's pointing, of course, to Riddick
- The eclipsing planet dominates half the sky
In whatever coronal light remains, we see clouds forming
- Cargo doors crack open
Mixed for maximum flame, the cutter is pushed outside and swept around
Fry appears behind it
Moving like hostages, the survivors cross open ground, trying not to heed the   beyond their light
Soon they reach
The main cabin
Blackness inside
Riddick
He lifts his goggles
' : Checking the cabin
Finding a lot of wreckage but no life
Looks clear
Johns shoulders ahead and crawls in first
Just as he stands up inside
over his head , fleeing the cabin, taking off into the night
Fuck me You said "clear
" Said "looks clear
" Well, what's it look like now
(rechecking) Looks clear
Just get the goddamn lights on
They scramble aboard
Riddick - behind Johns
He isn't amused
-   - : We see the survivors powering up cabin lights
yanking three more cells from the battery bay
threading nylon cord through Paris' misting umbrellas, filling the reservoirs with high-octane liquor
swapping out O2 canisters
-   - Reloading his shotgun, Johns finds himself shaking again
He unpockets a shell -- a red morphine shell -- and gives it a lover's look
Behind him
Ready, Johns
He palms the shell
He'll lead you over the first cliff
You know that, don't you
We're just burnin' light here
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you
He will leave you all out there to die
don't get it, Johns
What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing
Huh
Is there anything at all
Besides your next hype
(no response) Got no right to be so scared
Neither one of us
-   - As hands yank the last power cell
-   - Cabin lights die
Still brooding, Johns finishes loading his shotgun in the dark
- on a burning wick
Alcohol mist shoots across the flame to create
Two umbrella torches, fabric already burned away, into the night
By this light and more, we see
Imam chained into the first harness of the drag-sled
Beside him, Johns fumbles with a second harness
Hands help him into the chains
The hands belong to
Riddick
Both men recognize the irony of the prisoner helping his captor into chains
(to all) Keep the light going
That's all we have to do to live through this
Just keep your light burning
Riddick loops a handlight over his neck, places it to shine light down his back
beacon
(to Fry) Be runnin' about 10 paces ahead
want light on my back -- but not in my eyes
And check your cuts
These things know our blood now
on Audrey
Overhearing, she goes stone-faced
Riddick
was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal
Just in case, you know, this actually -- (shaking head) Had it with deals
But  just wanted to say -- Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose
fuckin' knew better
It worries Fry
"If he doesn't expect to go free
" (') Been a long time since anyone's trusted me
That's somethin' right there
We can, can't we
Trust you
Actually
(completely genuine) That's what  been askin' myself
He walks away
on Fry -- wondering if she hasn't made a terrible, terrible mistake
The drag-sled begins moving
: Riddick running point, goggles off, eyes flashing
Johns and Imam pulling the drag-sled like malamutes, handlights sweeping
Pilgrims #1 at the first side- guard position, Fry and Audrey at the second, each position carrying an umbrella torch,
Paris stumbling along at rear-point, sweeping the cutter back and forth, every shadow a threat
They are a train of light
on the sled
Holding four power cells and eight bottles of booze
on Fry
Looking down
Noting sand-cat tracks underfoot
Below us run the survivors
so that their lights become insignificant
so that we include, in , the silhouettes of gliding predators
They're following from above, awaiting their chance
' : Of the ground
The sand-cat tracks have vanished
So you noticed too
Riddick
Riddick The procession grinds to a halt
Everyone sucks hard on breathers as they muster inside the light
Where are the sand-cat tracks
Why aren't we still following them
Saw something  didn't like
Such as
Hard to tell, sometimes
even for me
but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off
Thought we'd swing wide
Okay by you
Paris looks over his shoulder
"We went around what " Nearby breaks up the confrontation
Let's move
(to Audrey) Just a detour
He'll get us there
Can we switch
What, switch what
think  twisted my ankle running backwards like that
And 'm not sure can
(off their stares) Okay, that's a lie
just don't want to be alone back there anymore
If you could just give me a few minutes up front here -- She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells
Oh, so 'm disposable
'll switch, 'll switch
Christ, just get this train moving
They trundle on, Fry the new tail-gunner
At side guard, Paris relaxes a bit -- even though the never seems far from earshot
weak   from his torch
He checks the reservoir
Almost empty
Light, please, need light here
Still moving, Johns and Imam train lights on Paris while he refuels
For a brief moment, Audrey strays from the light
' : Dive-bombing the girl
- : It's like an incoming missile
Imam lunges at the last nanosecond
And flattens Audrey to the ground
Scythe blades swing
the harness-chains on Imam's back Johns whirls,
Light-beams leap around
But the predator is long gone
(trembling) Please
have we been cut
Can someone tell me if
He finds his dropped light, thumbs the switch again and again
Broken
In the confusion, Paris has been left in the dark
Something slashes him from behind It's like the night has claws
Oh, sweet Jesus
The bottle drops
The blood flows
The
Oh, sweet Jesus, Faces whip around
But before their lights can rescue him
Paris is gone , snatched away by a swooping blur
Light-beams jump fitfully, vainly
' : Of predators feasting on Paris
Carrying a youngling on its back, a female predator arrives late and can't find a place at the trough
With shocking apathy, it whips the youngling off its back and begins devouring it
Other predators start in-fighting, killing themselves for food
to a pair of predators, closer,  out new prey to include the object of their desire
Audrey on Riddick
Trying to figure it out
on Audrey
Listening to the
Oblivious to all the attention she's getting
What do you see
Riddick
Hunger
see 60 years of hunger
- As clouds mass
Into a rising wind, the survivors range on
Audrey now carries Paris' torch, refueled and at regular intervals
Fry seems to be handling rear-point fairly well, until
The cutter sputters and dies
She ditches it and takes the torch from Audrey
Bottle-count
Four fulls, one half
That mean we're halfway there
hope
Good question
They've just been blindly following
The light on Riddick's back
Can we pick up the pace
Working like a mule, Johns growls to himself
"If you think you can do better
" Abruptly he slaps an arm across Imam's chest, spotting
sled-track
In front of them
Fry hears a
She spins to see
Johns out of his chains
Moving forward
Jamming the shotgun into the back of Riddick's neck
We aren't completely stupid
Stay in the light
Everybody
Stay in the fucking -- We crossed our own tracks
He's running us 'round in circles
Look for yourself
Look
Riddick
What the hell are you -- Listen Imagine a hundred Geiger-counters next to a truckload of plutonium
That's the  that rides the wind now
Canyon ahead
circled once to buy some time to think
Think about what
About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff
Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick
(answering Fry) About the girl
What about her
What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon
With her bleeding
What're you jaw-jackin' about
Girl's not cut
(agreeing) No
She's not
It hits Fry like a two-by-four
She looks at Audrey
(confessing) didn't want you to leave me there
back at the ship
that's why  didn't say anything
No, we'd never
Oh, God, honey, you shoulda told me sooner
(finally getting it) Aw, this can't be happening to me
They been nose-open for her ever since we left
They go off blood
Well
we must keep her close, then
Here, she'll be safe if we put her between -- (scanning) There is no "safe
" An epic beat
The wind gusts
the
their ears fill with
It's not gonna work
We gotta go back
Johns brays
Hey, you're the one who got me out here, turned me into a goddamn sled dog
An' now you 'spect me to go back like a whipped dog
was wrong
admit it
My bad, okay
Now let's just go back to the ship
dunno
Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, 'm startin' to enjoy myself out here
Are you fucking high again
Just listen to -- No, no, you're right, Fry
What's to be afraid of
My life is a steamin' pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow
So  say mush on
Canyon's only couple hundred meters, after that we're in Skiff City
So why don't you just butch up, stuff a cork in that kid, and get -- She's the captain, we should listen to -- Listen to her
Her When she was willing to sacrifice us all
beat
Eyes turn to Fry
She wants to protest -- but can't
What's he talkin' about
During the crash, she -- (a warning growl) This does not help us, Johns
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us -- Just shut up, okay
-- tried to kill us in our sleep
Paris had it right -- we are disposable
We're just walking ghosts to her
Would you
She rushes him, ready to rip his eyes out
He shunts her aside
We're not alive because of her -- we're alive in spite of her
He swung below the belt -- and connected
Fry's chin quakes, her knees fail
The undertow of events finally pulls her down
We cannot go through there
(lording) How much you weigh right now, Fry
Huh
(pushing him back) Fine, fine, you've made your point
We can all be so scared as you
Johns snatches a light away from Imam
(to all) Verdict's in
The light moves forward
- They trudge on, slower now, building reserves for the canyon-run
At rear-point, Fry follows like a broken rudder
Pilgrim #1 now draws the sled with Imam
And up ahead
- Johns falls in step with Riddick
Ain't all of us gonna make it
Just realized that, huh
nearby
Johns  the night, driving the sound away -- and reminding everyone of who carries the Big Gauge
Six of us left
If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh
good thing, right
Not if 'm the one
What if you're one of five
Riddick stares
"'m listening
" - What're they doin' up there
Talking about the canyon,  suppose
How to get us through
Overhearing, Fry looks
It's odd to see Johns and Riddick walking side by side, like equals
Like partners
- Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies
It's called "triage," okay
Kept calling it "murder" when  did it
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto
(doping it out) Sacrifice play
Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon
Like a bucket of chum
Trawl with it
There's a cable on the sled
We can drag the body behind us
Nice embellishment
Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent
(looking back) So which one caught your eye
Don' look, don' look, don' look
- Fry spots Riddick's look -- and Johns' non-look
Imam
Slow down
What
Don't stop, just slow down
Little more space 'tween us and them
would rather we all stay-- Do what  say
Please
- What's her name, anyway
What do you care
Riddick shrugs
" don't
" Then let's not name the Thanksgiving turkey, okay
assume you still got a shiv
What, you 'spect me to do it
What's one more to you
Like this is the one that sends you to Hell
Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns
They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere
Or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you
- As Fry and the others keep slowing
- Awright
You do the girl, 'll keep the others off your back
Riddick stops
Reconsiders
(') Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples
(shakes head) Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum
Like who, Mr
Chrislam
on both men: In their eyes, we see the new partnership splintering apart: "Like Mr
Johns
" Riddick makes a play for the shotgun It  skyward
- As the fight erupts: Bring the light
What're they doing
What're we -- Leave the sled, let's go, go, go
- : Johns' light hits the ground, creating an arena of illumination
nearby
Still struggling, Riddick and Johns somehow manage to gang-aim the shotgun and The shotgun goes free
Johns lunges for it, but Riddick kicks it into the night
And then pulls his shiv
Gotta stay in the light, Johns
That's the only rule
Johns circles inside the light
Fucking with him, Riddick starts poking and jabbing, backing him up against the wail of dark
Johns stumbles over something
bone
club
Riddick finds his own bone-club, and now they go at it like two cavemen
Riddick beats on Johns' club-hand, breaking fingers, forcing him to drop the bone
Just trying to get away now, Johns makes a desperate lunge for the light, but
Riddick shivs open his back
Remember that moment
Gushing blood, Johns starts crawling pathetically with the light
Riddick dogs him
Shoulda never took the chains off, Johns
You were one brave fuck, before
Now look at you
Oh, yeah, you were Billy Bad-ass with your gauge
with your chains
Johns finds the shotgun "And 'm still Billy Bad-ass
" He sweeps it around with the light, ready to kill
Blackness
Where'd Riddick go
behind Johns
He whirls to see
Something big coming for him Johns   back into the night, dropping the light as he does
Eyes in the back of his head, he whirls again and takes aim on
Another bull-rushing predator
Johns triggers a bad round
Crazed, he ratchets and levels the shotgun for another try
He's too late
as the ejected shell rolls to a stop
It's red
Johns loaded a morphine shell in the dark
' : With Johns skewered by the armpits, the predator lifts him off the ground and "stares" with a deceptively gentle -
' : Of Johns' final expression
' : The predator rears back its head -- then slams forward, hitting Johns with the full force of its skull-blade, splitting him in two
Fry, Imam, Audrey, Pilgrim #1
They're running, stumbling, trying to backtrack the sled marks
Checking for pursuit, Fry looks over her shoulder
And crashes into Riddick He was just standing in the dark, waiting for them
Back to the ship, huh
Get out of our way
So everybody huddles together till the lights burn out
Until you can't see what's eating you
That the big plan
Where's Mr
Johns
Which half
You mean
Conflicted, they all look back
Audrey starts to puddle up
Gonna lose everybody out here
He died fast
And if we got any choice, that's the way we should all go out
(to Audrey, softly) Don't you cry for Johns
Don't you dare
-   - We hear the canyon in full cry now --
-
the and
Far below, twin flames appear as the survivors reach the gauntlet
Predators perch in , just hulking silhouettes "watching" from a canyon rim
- They are but five: Fry, Riddick, Audrey, Imam, and Pilgrim #1
on each face as they listen to the
There must be countless predators ahead
How many you see
One or two
Audrey
Three full bottles
But almost time to refill
Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on, does it
Only see one way
Turn the sled over and drag it like that, girl down low
Light up everything we got -- and run through like dogs on fire
beat
(understanding) The sled as a shield
And what about the cells
'll take those
She looks at him hard
We're just here to carry your light, aren't we
Just the torch-bearers
Let's drop back an' boot up
- on the power cells
They're been lashed together into one queue
Working amid the giant bones, Riddick crafts a new harness from the old straps
Close behind him, Imam is
What're you doin'
Blessing you like the others
(off his look) It's painless
And pointless
(a beat) see
Well, even if you don't believe in God, it doesn't mean He won't be -- You don't see
Riddick shrugs into the harness, snugs it down
(') 'Cuz you don't spend half your life in lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth and not believe
And you surely don't start out in a liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck and not believe
Oh, absolutely  believe in God
And  absolutely hate the fucker
He will be with us
Nonetheless
Give my blessing to the girl
She needs a spare
- The torches
Maxed out
Burning non-stop
Fry and Imam
Sled chains on
Lapping up O2
Each holding a torch
Pilgrim #1
Clutching a handlight
Audrey
Rolling under her sled-shield, becoming the turtle in a metal carapace
Riddick
Goggles on
He has no desire to see what horrors will surround them
There's just one path, anyway: Straight through
As fast as you can
You sure you can keep -- As fast as you can
- : Fry and Imam on the move, dragging the shield fast
Audrey speed-crawling beneath
Pilgrim #1 tripping along behind the shield
And Riddick behind them all, face already tortured, pulling 200 pounds of stubborn-mule cargo -- yet somehow keeping pace
The torch flames, stretched by the wind, flank them in fire
-   - As predators launch from the rim
- First come the hatchlings, streaming right into their faces -- then veering away at the last second, repulsed by light
Next come   overhead
Don't look
Thin blue liquid spatters them
Do not look up
More spattering
Fry looks up -- and stumbles when she beholds
ceiling of predators At the cusp of light, they dive and weave and dart, slashing each other in a rabid desire to the humans below
It's like looking into a bucket of angry eels
Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going
His voice whips them like the Devil's coxswain
Chastened, Fry keeps her eyes down and speed up
More blue blood showers down -- followed by entrails dropping out of the sky
Could this be Hell itself
(a muttered mantra) "So dark the clouds around my way cannot see, But through the darkness  believe God leadeth me
gladly place my hand in His when all is dim, And, closing my weary eyes, lean hard on him
" Now      around them, victims of in-fighting
Fry and Imam start slaloming through the ghastly mess
Pilgrim #1 passes too close to a corpse:  blade slices his leg, drawing blood
He keeps his mouth shut
- -   - The passage narrows into a choke-point
Fry sees it first
Riddick
Ahead, a clot of dead predators blocks the canyon What
What is it
It's a fucking staircase
Go over it
Steeling themselves, they start climbing
But Audrey, on all fours, has to discover the corpses with her hands Then, taking exception at being walked on
One "corpse" snaps at her Audrey recoils sideways
And tumbles down the mound of corpses
She's exposed
' : Rapid-fire images of Audrey
Flashes from 10 different predators
Audrey
Audrey shakes out of it and scrambles for the shield just as
predator kamikazes onto the shield , its bone-blades piercing the metal
And nearly skewering Audrey beneath
Caught in torchlight, steaming, the   as it tries to rip free of the shield
Beneath, Audrey hangs on and takes a thrashing
The predator tears clear, spins, pounces blindly at
Riddick, standing at light's edge
Stunningly, he catches the beast under its scythe blades , blunting the attack
The predator at him
' : Of Riddick's face
The predator rears back its head, ready to bisect Riddick with its skull-blade
Switchblade fast, Riddick drops a hand
yanks his shiv
and sweeps it over the belly of the beast
, the predator falls, disemboweled
of Fry and Imam
Stunned
Didn't know who he was fuckin' with
They regroup
Imam's head swivels back and forth: They're one person short Suleiman
Get the girl back under
Keep going
Suddenly Pilgrim #1 reappears , thrust back into the light by unseen forces
He's still alive -- but shouldn't be
He makes a feeble attempt to grab onto Imam, to anyone, but he's gone again before they can even react, jerked out of the light
Out of existence
- They flail on
And now, finally
finally
The canyon widens, opening up like some door to Heaven
The fall behind
We can see it in their sweat-sheened faces: The faintest hope that maybe they've survived the Seventh Circle of Hell
But then
The
Audrey hears  on the metal shield
Blood falls anew
One torch dies -- yet somehow comes back to life
Imam upturns a hand, checking the liquid for color
But this blood has no hue
Oh, no
No, no, no
Rain
- : Water rilling, running, flowing over rocks and ground
- Caught in a downpour, the survivors slog to a stop
One torch goes out -- and won't relight
So where the hell's God now, huh
(no answer from Imam) 'll tell you where
He's up there Riddick
How close
Riddick sheds goggles to look ahead
We don't know what he sees -- nor what he's thinking
Tell me the settlement is right there
,
We can't make it
on Fry's anguished face, rendered in dying torchlight
Somewhere behind, the
Here
hide here
He's found a crevice in the canyon wall
Inside
inside
-   - They crawl into the fissure
The second torch dies behind them
- There's just one light left now -- the one Riddick wears on his back
By its glow, we watch him lift the shield, muscle it over to the crevice
-   - and slide it over the opening
black beat
(a beat) Why's he still out there
Fry's not sure
Is he protecting them
Or entombing them
-   - Working like Sisyphus, Riddick hauls the cells up a muddy rise
He stops at the top, peers through the rain
' : Of the settlement
Riddick disappears over the rise
The four cells follow, slithering through the mud like a serpent's tail
-   - He's not coming back, is he
Fry checks Imam's face
Did Riddick say anything to you
" Imam wags his head
bleak beat -- before Fry realizes she can see his face
There's light in here
It's a soft glow from above
Imam climbs higher to discover small blue-white lights clinging to rocks
He plucks a few
What are they
on the lights in Imam's palm
They writhe with life
Larva
Glow worms
(mind racing) How many bottles we got
Empty ones
- Riddick boards the dark craft
Connects the power cells to the battery bay
Watches the ship come to life
-   - on a liquor bottle
It's half full of glow-worms
More, more, we need more
They climb higher
Little by little, the bottle brightens their world
- Drenched in light, Riddick stands in the hatchway of the skiff, looking out into dark rain
Is he struggling with a decision
Or just savoring the safe harbor
Then very deliberately
Riddick smashes his handlight on the hull
He steps inside and closes the hatch behind him
-   - Something claws its way up the rise
Standing, we see that it's Fry, a bottle of glow-worms strung around her neck
Ahead she spies
The settlement
Silhouetted by engine-light
- As the skiffs
- As Riddick dabbles with flight controls
- As Fry, running, splashes past buildings
-   - Audrey and Imam huddle around a bottle of glow-worms: This is all they could harvest
Presently   on the shield
Imam eases one eye to a small hole in the shield
He can't see much until
blade rushes through the hole Imam recoils hard, snatches up the glow-worm light to see
More predator blades exploring the edges of the shield
The light drives them away
For now
- Riddick dims interior lights, activates exterior lights
He's actually startled by the sight of
Fry
Standing in the skiffs headbeams
Daring him to run her over
Eye-lock
Riddick opens the hatch
- They meet at opposite ends of the gangway -- Fry in the rain, Riddick in the light
Strong survival instinct
Admire that in a woman
You're not leaving
Not until we go back for the others
He laughs at that
(') promised them we'd go back with more light
And that's exactly what we're gonna do
Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck
What, you're afraid
Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was his monkey
only deal in life and death
All that stuff in between
Some shade of grey my eyes don't see
trusted you , Riddick
Goddamn, trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race
Truthfully
wouldn't know how
Fry realizes it's impossible to shame a shameless man
With desperation edging her voice: Then wait for me
'll go back myself
Just give me more light for them
He tosses her a light
The broken one
Just come with me
Got a better idea
Come with me Fry's mouth moves but nothing comes out
(') They're already dead
Get on board
You're fuckin' with me
know you are
'Course  am -- but doesn't mean  won't leave you here
If you believe anything about me, better be that
No, you see, promised them
have to
have to go and
She's bleeding resolve
Riddick can see it -- can smell it -- and he keeps slashing away
Step aboard, Carolyn
(tortured) can't
can't
(approaching, extending a hand) Here
Make it easy on you
Don't do this to me
Just give me your hand
But they
they could still be
No one's gonna blame you
'mon
Take my hand and save yourself, Carolyn
beat
She takes his hand -- and jerks him down the gangway They sprawl through mud
She gets a knee on his neck
will not give up on them
Will not leave anyone on this rock with those fucking things, even if it means -- In a blur, Riddick rolls and slaps a shiv on her neck
Is history repeating itself
Riddick's face, though, is strangely calm
Curious
Even gentle
You'd die for them
would try for them
You barely know them
But 'm human
know you view that as a weakness, but 'm sorry -- do feel fear, theirs too
Goddamnit, Riddick -- yes
would die for them
-   - at the shield
Imam cocks his blade back, ready to do battle with
Fry
She heaves the shield aside
Behind her, Riddick
(big-eyed) You came for us
Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed
Anyone not ready for this
- Protected by the meager light of two glow-worm bottles, the four remaining survivors head out
Tighter, tighter
-   - Stop
They pile up awkwardly
Fry listens hard
Only
don't hear -- He covers her mouth
' : Water has pooled at the base of the muddy rise
predator drinks there
(on his breath) Doesn't see us
wait for it to leave
' : Another predator lands to drink
Then another
Their backs are to us, but the pool is turning into a major gathering place
Soon they all can hear  above the
Their nightmare is far from over
Get behind me
' : Of a half-dozen predators shifting places at the pool
slim gap appears
When  go, we go
Full-throttle
on their hands, gripping each other
Ready
ready
' : The gap between predators widens into a passage
gauntlet within a gauntlet
Riddick runs Linked like paper dolls, the others follow blindly
' : Of a predator turning to "stare" over its shoulder
' : Of Riddick bearing down fast
The survivors hit the water like lawn mowers on legs, crashing through, scattering water and predators alike, managing to reach
The muddy rise
Audrey loses her grip on the others
And starts back-sliding She  , turning the head of
Riddick
He catches Audrey as her legs hit the pool
He muscles her back up the rise and heaves her over the top, sending her slip-sliding down the other side
You know the way
Not waiting for him, Fry and Imam disappear over the rise
' : Of the predators
Regrouping
Crawling up the rise at us
Fry, Imam, and Audrey run hard, glow-worm lights bouncing wildly
' : Chasing them
' : Chasing Riddick - Fry, Imam, and Audrey reach the settlement
They spill around a corner and see
The light of the skiff
- ' : Ahead of us, we see Fry, Imam, and Audrey vanishing around the corner
, we follow in their steps, storming around the same corner
Suddenly a predator is right there , right in our face
' : Of Riddick skidding to a stop
He snaps a look up
' : Of another predator perched gargoyle-like on the building
It - at us
' : Of Riddick slowly pulling two shivs
Bracing himself
Ready to blade it out
- Imam and Audrey stagger aboard
Safe in the light of the headbeams, Fry turns back, panting, waiting
Waiting
Captain
He wants her to board the skiff
Fry gives it another beat, eyes sweeping the dark rain
And just when we think it's over for Riddick --   are heard from both man and predator: There's a helluva fight going on out there
Close out there
Fry snatches the glow-worms off Imam's neck
And plunges into the darkness, homing in on the  until
blade flashes in her face She ducks and spots
Riddick
Bloody, muddy, he's down on his knees, still trying to fight off the shadow-beasts that swirl and slash all around him
Around them both It's me, it's me, it's me
She gets the light around his neck
Now we see his face clearly -- and see a very human expression there: Fear
Fry grabs his armpits and tries to pull him up
'mon, Riddick -- said 'd die for them not you
He gets his feet under him
Gripping each other, they start moving, turning like dancers in a macabre waltz, hoping the predators can't fix on Riddick's blood
Just 10 steps
keep turning, keep turning
that's right
others're already 'board, waitin' for us right now
five steps
c'mon, almost there, Riddick
almost there
we're almost -- Something jolts them
: Searching each other's eyes
Someone just got slashed from behind, slashed bad
But who
Not for me
In an eyeblink she's gone, ripped from his arms
There was no scream
No cry
No final words
Just
Blackness
'  - Out of the blackness, a spot of fire races toward us
It resolves into the skiff, fabric wings burning off as it hits escape velocity
- on a bloody hand
It toggles through nav-charts, plots a rendezvous with "Sol-Track 17B" shipping lane
In the cockpit, Riddick finds Audrey beside him
She stares hypnotically at the stars ahead
Probably okay to talk to me now
Not sure where to go
was just runnin' away when this whole thing started
(a beat) Where you goin'
Not sure
was just runnin' away when this whole thing
Interior smiles
Stars sweep the windscreen as the skiff makes a course-correction
One very bright star comes into view
Might interest you
Imam moves forward
Seeing, his face lifts
New Mecca
Think a soul could get lost there
With all those pilgrim-types
It's more a place where souls are found, Mr
Riddick
As Riddick ponders the possibilities, we
'  - The first sun flares out from behind the eclipsing planet
Its light feels cleansing
Renewing
Life-giving
