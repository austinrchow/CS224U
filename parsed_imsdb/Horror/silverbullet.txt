: Crickets
: - rail-rider comes chugging along the tracks
Aboard is , a big man in a strappy -shirt and chino pants
He is drinking beer
(sings) My beer is Rheingold the dry beer
Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer
He drains the rest of his own bottle of Rheingold and tosses it to one side
Up ahead we see a switching point
throws the rail-rider into neutral, opens the toolbox on the back, and brings out a big five-cell flashlight
He shines it on the switch
He gets a crowbar from the toolbox, plus a big wrench, a pair of pliers, a hammer, and a pair of work gloves
He also gets another bottle of beer and sticks it into his back pocket
jumps down and approaches the switch
, He drops his tools, pulls on his work gloves, and trains the light on the switch for a moment
During this: (sings) It's not bitter, not sweet, it's a real frosty treat, won't you try, won't you buy Rheingold beer
He tries the switch
No go
It's frozen
Stuck tighter'n dogshit in a deep freeze
He takes the bottle of beer from his back pocket and fishes a churchkey from one of the front ones
He pops the cap and drinks deeply
He burps
Then he screws the half-empty bottle of beer into the cinders so it won't fall over
Then he picks up his crowbar
- There's a  of bushes shaking
Something comes out - something huge
It leaps limberly onto the rail-rider
It is a werewolf with greenish-yellow eyes
Tatters of clothes still hang from it
What kind of monster, exactly
It is humanoid as well as wolfish
and when we learn who it is in its human form, we should be able to spot the resemblance at once
and kick ourselves for not knowing earlier
It crouches there, huge and bushy and fanged and deadly, on the whole rail-rider
He's working the crowbar into the junction point just as hard as he can
Swearing at it under his breath
Suddenly, both the tracks and the switch move
Hot damn
Now
a little oil
He turns back toward the rail-rider
,    - It's not bitter, not sweet
it's a big fuckin' treat
- bushes rattling; cinders clinking and rattling
looks around
, ' Nothing there
His bottle of beer stands by the litter of his tools
,   - He's rooting around in the toolbox, back to the switching point
'   , hairy hand/paw closes around it - we see huge curved claws on that hand
' , Glaring green-yellow eyes; a savage, beastial face which is still half human
That's all we see
The rest is in shadow
It opens its mouth and upends the bottle of beer
Foamy Rheingold begins gurgling down the werewolf's throat
- He comes up with an old-fashioned oilcan, the kind with the long spout
He starts back to the switching point, waving the can
(sings) My beer is Rheingold the dry beer
Think of Rheingold whenever you fry beer
He arrives, looks down
and stops singing
His eyes widen
, ' We can see the hole where  put his beer, but it is of course empty
Beside it are two huge prints in the cinders, half wolf, half human
He's beginning to be afraid
Beginning to look around to see what might be out here with him
Beginning to realize he is in extremely deep shit
:  , It rises up on its hind legs, eyes glaring an ugly yellow green
Its snout wrinkles back, revealing those teeth
He's craning back to look at the thing, his face a grue of horror
Oh n- huge clawed hand/paw comes sweeping down
's head is granted an immediate Reno-style divorce from the rest of his body
- of the beast approaching
hairy arm and taloned hand reaches into the toolbox bolted to the back and rummages
The hand is dripping blood
It comes up with a bottle of Rheingold
The  begins to sing
It is a bizarre funny-horrible grunting, the words hellishly recognizable
(gutteral; subhuman) My beer is Rheingold the dry beer
No bottle opener for this thing; it brings the neck of the bottle down sharply on the edge of the toolbox
Beer foams out
' , He/It rams the jagged neck of the bottle deep into its mouth and drinks
Foam drizzles down its pelt
It's grinning
(snarling voice) Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer
, The bottle is empty
There are   as it begins to eat the bottle
Blood begins to run out of its mouth; its face wrinkles in pain and fury
It spits out broken, bloody jags of glass
Looks up

'    - We're looking at Main Street of a small country town - might be New England, might be mid-South
Might be 1984, might be 1981
This is Tarker's Mills, and in places like this, time moves more slowly
Cars - not too many - move back and forth
No one is in a hurry
We see the Methodist church (and the parsonage next door); Andy's Sporting Goods; Owen's Pub, with its Narragansett neon sign
We see a barber shop with a striped pole; we see the Holy Family Catholic Church and the rectory next door
We see the Gem Theater, which is showing a revival of Sophia Loren in "Two Women
" It's Our Town,
(voice-over) This place is Tarker's Mills, where grew up
and this is how it was when was fourteen - a place where people cared about each other as much as they cared about themselves
This is how my town looked as, all unknowing, it approached the rim of the nightmare
The killing had begun

We hear the HOWl
and  looks up uneasily
b
) In the barber shop,  McCLAREN, the barber, is just taking the apron off the Methodist minister,
'
They both look around
c
) Folks are coming out of the Gem Theater
They pause at the sound of that  and look toward the edge of town
, As  speaks, we see the moon sink below the horizon
(v-o) The killing had begun, but at first no one knew it
Arnie Westrum was a chronic drunk, and what happened seemed like an accident
-  ' Slowly the view improves, grows lighter, as we - :  train is approaching
We hear its horn
Here is a shattered Rheingold bottle
There is a litter of ' tools
And here, on the cheek of ' severed head, a few ants are checking things out
: The train's horn,
(v-o) The county coroner concluded that Arnie passed out on the tracks
There wasn't enough evidence to conclude anything else
And suddenly the train comes smashing into the frame, horn blaring
The rail-rider goes flying
' body disappears underneath
We see something flopping and moving under there
It could be a bundle of rags
Could be
but isn't
: ' The common is more or less in the center of town, either surrounded by Main Street commerce or backed by it on a big tent that's been erected on the Common - looks like a revival meeting tent, almost, but the banner draped over the entrance reads: '
Behind or to the side, on the grass, picnic tables have been set out end-to-end
Women are putting salads and home-baked breads on these - just about the whole town is going to sit down to a meal when the meeting's over
Further off, men are tending barbecues, roasting corn, etc
(amplified voice) 'd like to give you Father Lester Lowe, of Holy Family Catholic Church
Enthusiastic applause greets this
Most of the town is here, seated on folding chairs
We're looking particularly at three people -  , her husband , and their fourteen-year-old daughter,
It is  - a slightly older  - who we have heard speaking
She is now a bit bored with the meeting, which has been going on for some time
As the  , she leans toward her mother
'm going out for a while, 'kay
All right
Stay close
And make sure your brother's all right
As  gets up, the applause starts to fade a bit
:  is wearing a silver crucifix, and will continue to wear it through the whole movie
To one side is a big black-and-white photograph on an easel
It shows a van which has been customized into an emergency medical unit
Behind the podium are four chairs
' sits in one of them
sits in another, red-faced and beaming
, the town constable, is just returning to his;   is just approaching the mike as the applause dies
' face shines with love and goodwill
For the last ten years
No amplification
He taps the mike
She is making her way down the row to the aisle (the people should be seated in folding chairs)
She passes a  of about her own age who has overheard ' parting shot
(mocking) "Make sure your brother's all right
" (low) Marty's a booger
She reaches the aisle and starts out
, He taps the mike again
, (good-natured) Just pretend you're in your own church askin' for money, father
It'll work fine
Good-natured laughter greets this
bit flustered, he taps the mike and is rewarded by a For the last ten years,  have had a dream
dream of a time when modern medical care would come to this small community, which sometimes seems so far from Durham, with her lifesaving hospitals
hope that this meeting, at which  see so many of my friends gathered, will be the start of making my dream come true
: Enthusiastic applause
, It's a blacksnake
harmless, but big
It goes wriggling through the grass toward a stream
In the b

- (voice) Holy
Brady, are you sure they're not poisonous
(voice) Little old blacksnake
Hell, no
Hands - the rather grimy hands of a boy bent on mischief - grab the blacksnake
, holds the snake up
Both boys gaze at it with respectful wonder
:  is wearing a silver St
Cristopher's medallion, and will through the whole movie
Lemme hold him
hands it over
As  looks at the snake, sees: , (v-o) was almost fifteen that summer
My brother Marty was eleven
Marty and his friend Brady Kincaid were the crosses had to bear
Brady was actually the worse of the two, but  was rarely disposed to see that
Not when my younger brother was so constantly thrown in my face by my parents
(v-o from the tent) $32,000 is a lot of money
But when you think of the lives this unit might save, it seems very inexpensive indeed
Applause greets this
Again we are fairly tight on the boys - we see them from waist or chest height
snatches back the snake
got an idea
What
looks toward
follows his gaze
His eyes widen
You wouldn't
grins
assesses the grin
You would
, An endeavor like this seems to me to be the very definition of community - all of us pulling together as one, farmers and merchants
Protestants and Catholics
She is walking slowly toward the picnic area, and is passing under a tree
There's more applause from the tent
(teasing voice) Jane
Jane
She looks up
The blacksnake dangles down toward her, almost touching her upturned face
shrieks and bolts
She gets a little way, trips over her own feet and falls down hard
She's wearing what was a nice jumper and nylons
Now the jumper is torn and the hose shredded at the knees
, He's lying over a limb with the snake in his hand, laughing wildly
She gets up, looks at her clothes, her bloody knees
She's near tears
,      , The shot's from the chest up
He looks sorry he was a part of this little stunt, as he ought to be
It was just a blacksnake, Jane- She looks around at him in a fury of embarrassment and something very close to hate
Look at my knees
Look at my dress
hate you
, Did wittle Janie make wee-wee in her teddies
Stop it, Brady
, He throws the snake
She dodges the snake with a little scream
She's beginning to cry, but she flips  the bird just the same
, Ooooh, naughty
He moves toward  - there is something queerly unnatural in this movement, and in a moment we'll understand, but for the time being we must be puzzled
Jane, 'm sorry
It was just a joke
We didn't mean- He's reached her
is sobbing now, hysterical
Oh, no
You never mean to
hate you, you booger
She runs away
, He swings down and comes over to
(with satisfaction) Really got her goat that time
He's in a wheelchair, looking glumly after
Oh, shut up, Brady
You're warped
, She's walking slowly along, still crying a little
Now she steps behind some bushes, looks around, hikes up the skirt of her jumper, and wriggles out of the wrecked panty hose
(voice) Wait
Don't go
Startled,  looks around, instinctively yanking her dress down
No one in sight
(voice; rough) Just leave me alone
Now she looks toward: , ' man who looks like he might be a traveling salesman who has just stepped whole and breathing from a dirty joke about the farmer's daughter comes striding down from the bandstand
, a plump but sweetly pretty girl, comes to the stairs but does not descend them
She is also crying - but these are real tears, folks
is a human Niagara Falls
(calls) Please
You have to help me
(keeps walking) It's your oven, but it ain't my bun you're baking in there
Sorry, babe
g
: More applause
We can hear  sobbing as  walks slowly toward the bandstand with her panty hose still balled up in one hand
looks suddenly aware that she's not the only one in this sad world who has troubles
She reaches the foot of the stairs going up to the bandstand and tosses the hose absently in a litter can
mounts the steps timidly
Stella
Is that you
has retreated to one of the benches, where she is bawling into a handful of Kleenex
Pudgy and twenty-two, she is both funny and terribly sad
She looks around at the sound of 's voice
(alarmed) Who -
(approaching closer) It's Jane, Stella
Jane Coslaw
sees it is, and turns away from her, still weeping
stands, uncertain what to do next
After a moment she approaches closer and touches ' turned back timidly
(tenderly) What's wrong
(weeping) He's going away
know he is
Who's going away
turns to her, weeping still and distracted
What am  going to tell my mother
If he won't marry me, what am  going to tell my mother
(bewildered) Stella,  don't know what- Oh, leave me alone
Just leave me alone, you stupid thing
lumbers across the bandstand and down the steps stares after her, bewildered and perhaps even a little frightened
,
' ' Let us pray
Most of them bow their heads
', ' May the Grace of God shine upon those gathered here
and lift them up
and grant success to the endeavor to which they have so openheartedly declared their support
Amen
They raise their heads
Some echo the "Amen
" Others cross themselves
People are coming out and getting ready to chow-down
Traveling along a country road
Headed home
and   are sitting up front
and  are in the backseat
is as far from  as she can get
She's still mad as hell
Band-Aids crisscross her knees
' wheelchair is collapsed in the cargo area of the wagon
turns around to look at the kids - and it's really she's mad at
want you two to bury the hatchet
You're being very silly, Jane
(hot) Did you see my knees
Jane, - think you're being mean as well as silly
Your brother has never had a scraped knee in his whole life
Well, here it is - the chief source of ' animus against her brother and the source of most of the tension in the family
winces and turns away a little, embarrassed - this always happens
He doesn't like it, but he doesn't know how to make his parents - his mother in particular - quit it
You always take his side because he's a cripple
Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea couldn't stop him
Brady's a booger and so are you
Jane Coslaw
(roars) Stop it or 'll throw the whole bunch of you out
In this traditional family unit,  is the Voice of Authority
They all heed, although the atmosphere remains thundery
Train tracks run near the road
, (points) That's where poor old Arnie Westrum pitched his last drunk
He crosses himself and they all look toward: &   ( ' ) They had to pick up what was left of him in a peach basket
Oh, Daddy
Gross
Did he really get his head cut off, Dad
That's what Brady said
If you don't stop it 'm going to vomit
mean it
(no sympathy) You're not going to vomit, Jane
And think we've all had quite enough of this horror-movie talk
, Craning back to look at the spot where  bit the dust
His face is thoughtful, solemn
: is lying in bed, her face to the wall
Dim light falls on her unhappy face as the door is opened
(v-o) Janey
Are you awake
says nothing
' , He is in his "house wheelchair" - not the Silver Bullet (he was in the Bullet during the Common scene, but we didn't get a very good look at it)
He has some stuff on his lap box, for sure
Can  come in
Her eyes are open but she says nothing
Just looks at the wall
He rolls across to her bed and puts something on her night table
of change and a rattle of paper
She rolls over and sees he's put about three bucks on the table
Plus a can of mixed nuts
What's the money for
new pair of panty hose
Is it enough
don't want your money
You're a booger
It was Brady's idea, Jane
Honest to God
Please take the money
want to make up
She looks at him and sees he's sincere - honestly contrite
She softens
There's hope for these two kids yet, maybe
can get a pair of 'Eggs down at the pharmacy for a dollar forty-nine
Here
She pushes the rest back to him, then looks at the can
She picks it up, curious
That's for you, too
Uncle Al gave it to me- (scorn) That drunk
-but  want you to have it
He gives her a warm, melting smile
When your little brother is being good to you it's time to watch out - but  has been lulled
She starts to open it, then looks questioningly at him
Yeah, go ahead
She opens it
long paper snake - the kind with a spring inside it - leaps out
She shrieks
You booger
backs up the wheelchair so he's out of her reach
(grinning) It really is for your birthday, though - try it on Brady
He'll wet his pants
Go to hell
, (smiling) love you, Janey
, She tries to be angry with him
and cannot (this is a response, we'll find, that both  and his evoke)
She smiles at him a little
He reverses his wheelchair, also smiling a little, and leaves
' , We're looking down at a brave little nestle of lights
:
There's one light on upstairs and another downstairs
also downstairs is the bluish flicker of  light
An ivy trellis climbs one side of the house
: Canned laughter;  dialogue
' , asleep in front of the
, whole bunch of capsules are dumped into it
to show us , sitting by her vanity mirror
The rest of the room is reflected in the mirror, including the window - we are upstairs
[: It would be nice to see that fat moon floating in the window
] There's a framed picture of 's ex-boyfriend on the vanity beside the dish of pills
sets down the empty prescription bottle the pills came from beside this picture
We can clearly read the word "Nembutol" on it
There is also a large glass of water on the vanity table
turns the picture facedown
She might be crying but probably she's not
She takes about five of the pills, starts to lift them to her mouth- outside
closer
looks around for a moment, then takes the pills with some water
She pauses, looking at herself
Suicides go to hell
Especially if they're pregnant
And  don't even care
She takes another five pills
And another five
: Rattling foliage
Claw-hands are seizing it and climbing
of hoarse, guttural breathing
She takes another handful of pills
and the window behind her shatters inward
There is a bellowing roar as the werewolf throws itself through
, She sits up, startled awake
From upstairs: ' , She runs
and a huge claw-hand rips through the back of her nightgown
, Oh my dear God
Stella
She runs for the doorway and the hall
From upstairs comes a confusion of : roars, breaking furniture, shattering glass
' , One of those deadly claw-hands sweeps down the bed, ripping through the sheets
the mattress
the spring itself
Hairy, muddy feet with protruding talons leap onto it
' ,  - The werewolf leaps out - it's graceful, savage, animal
:
, She's found an ancient pistol somewhere and is lugging it gamely along
Stella
Stella
She reaches the closed door of 's room, vacillates there for a moment
and then pushes it open and goes in
long beat of silence as we hold on the door
' , She shrieks again
' , It's a total shambles; blood is splattered everywhere; the mirror is broken, the picture of  the gay deceiver is broken; the bed is torn in two
There are big, muddy wolfprints on the remnants of the bed
lies propped in the corner with Nembutols all around her
Suicide may have been what she planned, but it sure isn't what happened

puts out his paper rack - just the "Press-Herald" this morning
He looks shocked and grim
The scare headline:

) Through the window of Robertson's Luncheonette, we see the proprietor,  , talking earnestly with a bunch of men
Among them:  ,  , ,  McCLAREN, and  , a farmer we'll meet later

) At the Methodist parsonage, a '53 Dodge pulls slowly out and   gets out, weeping
As she approaches the parsonage door,   comes out and embraces her
The sign reads: '
,      - Neatly lettered on the panel: '
And below this:
(voice) Okay
yes
Oh, fuck off
' , slams the phone down with an angry bang
He looks like a guy who has been up all night
, his pudgy deputy, looks like a high school athlete who has suddenly found himself batting in the World Series
What'd they say, Joe
They said they'd be here by noon
(nervous) Maybe it wasn't such a good idea telling that Smokey Bear from the Detective Division to fuck off, Joe
(morosely) waited until he hung up
Jesus, what a mess
wish 'd stayed in the army
Let's go on out there
He gets slowly up
' It's a comfortable red-brick building on a side street
Ivy climbs up the sides
Two or three rows of bikes stand along one side of the building
: The bell rings
beat or two, then the doors bang wide and a billion kids spill out
It's the end of the first day of school, and they are excited
They range from Grade 1 to Grade 8
Most kids book it for home as fast as they can, getting on their bikes and riding or just running
Everyone has a pink report card
, and  are riding bikes
Now there is the  of a gasoline engine, and  catches up
He's got the Silver Bullet's motor running for the first time in the movie
Later on it will sound extremely powerful, like a racing car, but now it just sounds like a big lawnmower engine with a muffler on it
It's pretty cool, though - a bright metallic silver with flame decals on the motor housing
Looks sort of like something Big Daddy Roth might have thought up
On the back is a license plate which says Look out
Look out
It's Madman Marty and the Silver Bullet
laughs
You glad to be back in jail, Marty
Sure -  like school
You booger
That's what my sister says, too
Pretty soon 'm going to start checking the mirror to see if 'm turning green
gotta split - see ya, Marty
Tammy
, and  watch as  zooms off toward home on his bike
pushes in a hand clutch and moves a small lever
He bumps down over the curb and they cross the street side by side,  on her bike,  in his wheelchair
, He pops up over the curbing with a bounce
He shoves in the little hand clutch and revs the engine
Va-room
Not bad, huh
My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb
What's that
Glasspack
He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine
but now  dunno
He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother
For getting a divorce
Well
it is his third
, The other kids are gone; they are alone
The sidewalk has ended and they roll slowly along the dirt verge of the road
They look toward: ,   ' The driveway is blocked off with a sawhorse bearing the stenciled words
The yard is filled with cop cars - ' constable car, plus a number of state police vehicles
Uniformed men come and go
We can see a large black wreath on the door
Thanks for coming with me, Marty-  was scared to go past her house by myself
(matter-of-fact) Yeah
it is a little scary
mean,  saw her
All the time
stops her bike
She's on the verge of tears
used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did
mean  know how stupid that sounds, but
Hey, take it easy
know how you feel
He gets the Silver Bullet moving again, and she has to pedal along to catch up
, They stop at the end
There's something else scary
What
(points) That
,   ' It stands a bit behind the house itself
creepy place
Many of the glass panes are broken; some of these - not many - have been blocked with cardboard
The inside is a jungle of plants that have run to riot
In the f
g
is a mucky-looking garden patch where nothing much is growing
She is quite deeply troubled
've been hearing noises in there
What kind of noises
Rattling
Rustling
Rats
And my dad says it's kids
But it's not rats and it's not kids
It's- , Oh my suds and body, here is the Great American Alcoholic for sure - the rural version
is wearing a suit of pee-stained thermal underwear
He's wearing a baseball cap with the word "Caterpillar" on the front and has a bottle of beer in one hand ('m pretty sure that his beer is Rheingold the dry beer)
With his other hand he is busily scratching his crotch
Tammy, you get on in here and do some dishes
Sinister
spooky
(voice) 've got to go
'd go out and take a look myself, but think the Bullet'd get stuck in the garden
It looks sorta greasy
She smiles at him, bends over, and kisses him on the mouth
is stunned
but happy
You would, wouldn't you
(Joe Cool) Sure
No sweat
Well, it's probably nothing
'm just spooked since
you know
Yeah
but if you hear any more noises, tell your father
Okay
Okay
Have you got enough gas to get home, Marty
(Startled) Jeez
"," ' There's a gas gauge here, and the needle is almost on "
" 'm always doing this
gotta go, Tammy
(voice) (calls) Coming Daddy
(To ) Bye
thanks again for coming home with me
She waves and goes biking down the driveway as  motors back onto the street and turns toward town
She brings her bike to a stop by her father
'Bout time
Why you want to hang around that cripple
like him
Goddamn cripples always end up on welfare
Ought to electrocute all of 'em
Balance the fucking budget
Having delivered this pearl of wisdom,  goes inside, now scratching his ass
pauses a moment and looks toward , her face troubled and scared
, ' : He's buzzing along toward downtown, which is still some distance away - but at least he's made it back to the sidewalk again
(prayerfully) Come on, baby- He looks down at: , ' Now the needle is lying all the way over on "
" ' pulls in
The wheelchair motor starts to pop and lug and misfire
The chair makes it to the first pump on the island closest to the street and then stalls as comes over
Well, Marty
see you lucked out again
Yep
Would you fill it up, please, Mr
Cutts
Want me to check the oil
Sure
Wipe the windshield an check the driver's bullshit level
laughs;  starts carefully pumping gas into the Silver Bullet's small tank
Overhead is the moon, three days past the full

He's thirty, good-looking, raffish
He's also drunk
He's got both whiskey and beer
An ashtray beside him overflows with butts
He and  are playing draw poker for ' baseball cards
Each has a pile in front of him

his eyes just glow when he looks at him
Okay, okay

He tosses in three baseball cards
Wait a minute, wait a minute
He grabs one of ' cards, looks at it, and tosses it back

You can't bet a manager
Stone the crows
Okay, okay
Dwight Evans
Piss on him
Piss on all the Red Sox
He swallows whiskey and chases it with beer
, comes briskly over
She's seen and heard enough
She favors   with a glare and then looks protectively at Come on, Marty- bedtime
She starts to wheel him away
Mom-
Let the boy finish the game, Nan
He means it, drunk or not
She reluctantly rolls  back to the table
Make it quick
lays down his hand
Three kings
(delighted) got a straight to the queen
Bullshit luck
(outraged) That's enough
(as his mother wheels him away) Aww, Mom-
is sitting in a stair chair that rises slowly to the second floor
He looks dejected and glum
of  hectoring her brother
don't think we can make out all of what's going on, but we've all known women like  and  think we can fill in the blanks
"Christian household
you come here drunk and expect
can't even bother to call ahead
" Etc
, etc
wheelchair stands on the second-floor landing
This one is no Silver Bullet, only the more humble sort that moves by arm power
When the stair chair clicks to a stop, hoists himself from it into the wheelchair and rolls down the hall toward the bathroom
Below, ' rant is still going on
, is clearing up in a kind of drunken stupor- and mean he is really drunk
He's smoking one cigarette; another is smoldering away in the heaping ashtray
He drops a pile of baseball cards on the floor and bonks his head on the table bending down to pick them up
don't want you drinking around Marty
That's too much
If you can't stop it, you better stay away
straightens up
There is a sort of command force in this man, and here he is partly able to rise above his abysmal drunkenness so we can see it
come here because Marty needs a friend
Yes
you've always been that to him
But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away
She leaves the room, almost crying
looks after her, and then his attention is drawn to the smoldering ashtray
He pours beer over the mess, putting out the fire but creating something that looks even worse
He begins drunkenly picking up again
(to himself) Another wonderful time at Sister Nan's house
Heeyyy
, now in pj's, is brushing his teeth
comes in- she's wearing a nightie
Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she
What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed
Stop it
He lunges at her, but  steps back easily overbalances and falls out of the wheelchair
His toothbrush clatters across the tile
(sleepy voice) Hey
That you, Marty
He's okay, Dad
She looks around swiftly, then bends down
, One of ' cheeks is pressed against the floor
His eyes are shut
He's weeping
(low) Marty, are you all right
Yes
Go away
Let me help you up

throws a quick look back over her shoulder and then helps  up in his chair
He helps by pulling on the sink counter
has time to give  one quick look- "Please don't tell on me," it says
comes in
Jane, have you been teasing your brother again
She wasn't, Mom-  dropped my toothbrush and fell over when  tried to get it
Jane helped pick me up
He bats his eyes at her
(syrupy voice) Jane's wunnnderful
picks up his toothbrush
(hands it to him) Here
Brush them good, Marty
Some of that shit in your head might leak down into your mouth and poison you
Jane Coslaw
But  stalks off
is grinning
It was a good put-down
We can see the moon in the sky beyond the ruined greenhouse

' She's deeply asleep
"Big-time Wrestling" on the
of a refrigerator door closing

He's wearing his long johns with the designer pee stains and has a quart bottle of Rheingold the dry beer in each hand
He sits down, looking at the

Wring his neck
More noises
There is a beat of silence, and then something- one of those earthen plant pots,  think- falls over and , He looks up briefly- he's heard something- but the crowd on the  is loud and the match is reaching its climax
(all eyes again) Give him the sleeper, you fuckin bugwit
, Plants shake and shiver
Another crash,
, Looks toward the window
He gets up, goes over, and looks out
, - (' ) of another crash
Plants move
, He takes a shotgun from the wall, breaks it, and looks inside
Let's see if you want to come back and break my pots all to shit after  put some rock salt in your asses
The door at the end   and , still holding the shotgun at port arms, comes cautiously in
This place is really overgrown
advances slowly into the jungle of plants, and the director will shoot it as he likes to build the suspense
'm sure that plants brush his face, and a bug or two- maybe even a big plump spider- will land on him
He hears a   and whirls
(shouts) Who's there
, ' mouse goes running across the warped boards (which have pulled apart from each other, showing deep cracks between)
He relaxes and starts forward again
We keep expecting it to happen, but it keeps not happening
Then, as  is starting back toward the door, two big, hairy arms come up through the floor- bursting through two of those cracks and shoving the splintered boards upward- and grab ' legs at the knees
:
screams and triggers off the shotgun- unfortunately, it is pointing straight up
Glass showers down on him
He is pulled down into the shattered hole- now we can see him only from the knees up
' She sits up in bed
of  and   from the greenhouse

Tammy, where's your father
: Another  from the greenhouse
, He's now waist deep in the hole in the floor, surrounded by broken, splintered boards
:  ,
He is abruptly jerked downward again
He is being eaten from the feet up
As he's jerked down, one of the leaning, splintered boards rams into his chest
collapses over it like an old Roman collapsing on his sword
hairy arm reaches up and grabs his neck
is jerked all the way into the hole, board and all

They are hugging each other, terrified, by the window
, - The police cars are now here
There's also a meat wagon
As we watch, a number of cops-   and are among them- approach the wagon
Many are carrying canvas bags

' At a f

table:  ,  , , and his brother
Behind them, at the bar, we see   having a beer with McCLAREN
As we look around the bar, we will also see , sitting at an unobtrusive corner table, nursing a beer and listening closely to the conversation
(to ) Don't tell me an animal can't rip a man up the way Milt Sturmfuller was ripped up
But the woman's bed was ripped right down the middle, Elmer- it's take a chainsaw to do something like that
Damn straight
Shut up, Porter
(To ) What about the tracks
has joined the group
He sits down uninvited
That could be something to throw off the cops
And it ain't animals that try to confues the law; it's people do that
Law around here don't need much confusing
looks around at this
Being the deputy constable and ineffectual by nature, he's pretty sensitive
(deep disgust) Joe Haller couldn't find his own ass if someone rammed it full of radium and gave him a Geiger counter
(comes over) Could be  know a fella who's still 'd over getting fined two hundred bucks for that little fender bender out on the Ridge Road last year
Could be  know a fat old fella who ought to take care of his mouth before someone comes along and turns it inside out
pay Joe Haller's salary to keep the people in this town safe, and he ain't doing it
McCLAREN, He's looking toward the table where the Fairton group sits
(mildly) Last town report said you was in arrears your taxes, Andy
Guess you must have paid up, huh
What are you, trying to be smart
comes over
You guys turn down the thermostat or 'm gonna turn you all out
Now who's drinking
(sulks) Bring me a Schlitz
,  ' - of panting
comes into the frame, pulling himself up by the arms
His arms are very strong, although his legs trail limply behind him (like the tail of a kite)
He sits on a branch, untangles the kite and the string, and looks down
(calls) Here it comes
, Drop it
As the kite flutters down,  comes biking up
Marty Coslaw, you get down out of that tree
, He descends, then hangs from the lowest branch
Push the Bullet over, Jane, okay
(makes no immediate move to do so) Supper was an hour ago, Dumbo
(hanging) Oh, Jeez
forgot
Is she mad
They both are
At me, for not getting you sooner
ought to let you fall
But she pushes the chair over and  drops into it
He pushes the starter and the Silver Bullet fires up
, (voice) Hey, Brady
You coming
(looking into the sky) In a while
could give a shit if ' in trouble
He just waves vaguely
He's into the kite-flying experience, as the folks in Marin County might say
He's looking toward the common, frowning and uncertain
Come on, Marty
She starts biking away
starts after her, pauses, and looks at: , to the yellow smile-kite in the bluish-purple sky
' The former patrons are still here, with the exceptions of ,  McCLAREN, and
Many others have appeared; this is Happy Hour
Among them we see
, the principal, and , the druggist barmaid, , circulates with drinks and beers
Speaking of beer,   has gotten through a fair amount of Schlitz
It hasn't mellowed him, however; he's more belligerent than ever
(holding forth) This whole investigation has been as efficient as a Polish fire drill
It- (bravely) 've heard enough out of you, Andy
If you don't shut your mouth, 'm going to shut it for you
' It opens and a man in a business suit-  - comes in
He is carrying a briefcase and he looks worried
(astounded) What did you say
, Jesus wept
He reaches under the bar and comes out with a baseball bat
Burned into the side of the bat, so it reads vertically toward the handle, is the word "peacemaker
"  hurries around the bar with it

You heard what  said, motormouth
gets up, infuriated
There's apparently going to be a brawl
Behind them,   has approached the table
hasn't even noticed what's going on; he's got problems of his own
He clears his throat
This is a mild, timid man- he doesn't like to speak in public, particularly not in a bar, but the imperatives of the situation demand it right now
(quite loudly) Has anyone in here seen my son Brady

Conversation stops
and freeze with their fists balled up, like little kids playing statues tag

All have turned toward the door and the windows; all hear the
Deep fright overlies each face
drops her tray
Glasses and bottles shatter
comes out of the constable's office in a hurry, letting the door bang the wall
He's buckling on his gun belt
' kite, torn in a couple of places, flutters on the steps leading up to the bandstand
The yellow smile face grins eerily in the darkness
It is streaked with blood

He breaks for the door
grabs him
Get out of my way
He pushes  aside
is out the door, chased by and several of the others
(low voice) Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee
Blessed art thou among women
He comes out of the shadows, his drawn gun dangling by his side
This man has had an extremely bad shock
The legs of his uniform pants are splashed with blood
He makes it down two steps and then sits heavily by the remains of ' smiling, bloody kite
He looks straight ahead
He looks at nothing
(low) and blessed is the fruit of Thy womb
Jesus
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now

He looks at the kite, then looks away
He puts a hand over his face and starts to cry
, number of men - not all that were in Owen's but quite a few of them - are running toward the bandstand is in the lead, screaming his son's name over and over
:   , now at some distance
, As   approaches
Stay off the bandstand, Herb
Is it my boy
Is it Brady
Don't go up- (lunges past him) Brady
Brady
Disappears into the dark

Joe, is it- (not looking up) Shhh
Is it the Kicaid b- (not looking up) Shhh,  said
The men look uneasily at , at each other shoves forward

The men flinch back

Now, from the darkness on the bandstand,  begins to
The men shrink back further, looking more uneasy than ever

Now  gets up and joins the other men
(voice; laughing) That's what we'll have to do; we'll bury his shoes
Maybe in a couple of Roi-Tan cigar boxes

He is laughing
He is smeared with his son's blood
In each hand he holds one of his son's shoes
We'll bury his shoes because his feet are still in them and they're the only part of him that makes sense anymore
laughs harder
It's gonna be the cheapest funeral this town ever saw

, :
: : An organ is playing that sweet old hymn, "Bringing In The Sheaves
" There are lots of cars parked in front of the church, but there's a space left just big enough for  '
' Silver Bullet is strapped to the back
(v-o) My mother and father- my mother in particular- did not much care for Uncle Al
' chair is at the back of the church
Most of the mourners are crying
is playing the organ
' coffin is on a bier at the front - closed of course
There are lots of flowers
(v-o continues) but when it came to such unpleasant duties as taking Marty to the funeral of his best friend
, , , As we look at them, from left to right:  , , ,
unobtrusively takes a small silver flask from his hip pocket
Engraved on it in Old English letters is the word "rotgut
" He spins the cap and takes a quick knock
He pauses and glances at , who looks deeply stunned
(v-o continues) they didn't at all mind drafting him
As to the sort of comfort Uncle Al may have been able to offer him
hands the flask to
looks at him questioningly for a moment, and then drinks
looks at , who looks frankly terrible
Her mother is looking away
nudges her
She looks around at him
He offers her the flask
Her eyes widen
(v-o continues) now believe that was best kept between the two of them
After a brief moment's consideration,  takes the flask and has a deep swallow
She hands the flask back to , who hands it quickly back to   as  coughs
Her mother looks at her
then at  and smiles sympathetically, hiding the flask with one hand, as if to say, "Isn't it a terrible thing
" looks distractedly back toward the service
(v-o concludes) or among the three of them
pockets the flask just as the organ stops playing
, Mr
and Mrs
Kincaid have asked that there be no mass said here this afternoon
There will be a requiem mass for Brady Kincaid this Sunday
They did ask me to say a word of comfort to you, if  could
He looks out at them
They look back at , hoping for some help in understanding this awful thing
, If there is any word of comfort  can give you, it's just this: the face of the beast always becomes known; the time of the beast always passes
He is struggling with this, trying dreadfully hard
If there are times when we feel alone and afraid, only small creatures in the dark, then these are the times when we must turn to one another for our comfort and our hope
To our neighbors
To our community
To our love for each other
alone cannot ease the pain for Herb and Naomi Kincaid, nor can ease your pain, nor you ease mine
But if believe anything it's this: we can comfort each other
We can heal each other
We can go on together
, The kids are crying
puts an arm around  and she puts her head on his shoulder
The Bible tells us not to fear the terror that creepeth by night or that which flieth by noonday, and yet we do
we do
Because there is much we don't know, and we feel very small
But we must not be alone
We must not allow ourselves to be alone, for there is the wide gate to the hell of terror
Turn to each other
Join hands in your sorrow and try to remember that the face of the beast always becomes known
(Pause) The time of the beast always passes
(Pause) Let us pray
, and  look at each other miserably
begins to cry- for her father as much as for , one would think- and she and  embrace
, He looks at the kids with deep sympathy and deep love
' sports car passes
He's taking home
, You all right, Marty
Yeah
There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick
You ever hear that one
No
Well, 'm not sure that was
Christ
They better get the guy
Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy
Huh
What if it's some kind of monster
(laughs) Jesus, Marty
Come off it
' , It cruises past Owen's Pub
There are cars parked out front, but there are also lots of pickup trucks
, What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al
bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood
Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies
' car turns in and parks
, Tammy said she'd been hearing noises in that greenhouse
Growling noises, like a big animal
Her father was killed that night
looks at him doubtfully for a moment, as if almost believing
Then he shakes his head
Marty, you have to get this idea out of your head
Psychotics are more active when the moon is full, and this guy is a psycho
He's going to turn out to be as human as you or me
(Pause) In a manner of speaking
Now let's get you inside
He opens his door and gets out
, He would like to believe
but he doesn't
' Okay, you all know what group you're in and what area you'll be covering, right
Damn straight
Shut up, Porter
The men are all dressed in hunting clothes- red-and-black-checked shirts, orange caps, etc
They all have guns
Among their number are a few women as well, looking tough and determined
We see almost everyone we've met up to this point
is there, looking deeply troubled
is standing on the bar
These are his vigilantes; he has organized them
radiates male macho football-coach confidence
He's mesmerized the crowd: they really believe they are going to go out and Shoot One for the Gipper
Groups one through four are in the woods north of the Sturmfuller place
Five and six west of Carson Creek
The door at the back opens;  and  come in is in extremely bad shape
He hasn't come back much from the murder of
believe he is having some sort of spiritual crisis, and while it is not our purpose to explore what it might be- this is, after all, a horror movie and not a John Cassavetes film- we can see that it has seriously weakened his authority
(continuing) Moonrise at 8:52 p
m
Some nervous laughter greets this
Meanwhile,  and are working their way to the front, where they end up next to a grim-faced
(continuing) If he comes out to stroll in the moonlight tonight, we're going to get the sorry sucker
, (happily) Damn straight
Shut up, Porter
Just remember, it's the psycho we want, not each other
So look before you- , want all of you folks to go home
disgruntled murmur meets this
moves forward a bit, and turns to face them
can't remember deputizing a single one of you
That's right, Joe- the only deputy you got is that fat shitbag beside you, and neither one of you has done a damn thing about solving this case
There is a mutter of agreement
, hops off the bar to face  directly
In the b
g
we see   (, by the way, should be wearing a black armband- he's come directly from his son's funeral)
(without much force) We'll catch him
You couldn't catch a cold
looks at him for a moment, then turns to look at the crowd
They look rather like a lynch mob; on their faces we see an uneasy mix of shame and eager determination speaks with a kind of haggard, fading desperation
The law has a name for what you men are planning
It's private justice, and private justice is about a step and a half away from lynch mobs and hang ropes
'm no Edgar Hoover, but  am the law in Tarker's Mills, and  want you men to go home
They shuffle their feet uneasily; many look down
He is getting to them
Don't let this guy scare you
What's he done since this thing started but hang his face out
It's not working
Many of the men look disgusted with both and themselves
(louder) He ain't got so much as a fingerprint
Ah, shut up, Andy
Don't tell me to- steps forward
Yes
Correct
Shut up
, surprised and bewildered, does
turns and looks grimly at  , who can barely meet his gaze
(quietly) just came from my boy's funeral
Herb
know how upset- how grief-stricken you must be
but- (quietly) He was torn apart
Utter silence in ' place now
The others are staring, rapt
Yes
Yes, but- (still quiet) Upset, you say
Grief-stricken, you say
Constable, you don't know what those words mean
My son was torn to pieces
To pieces
turns to the others in the pub
Tears stream down his face
My son was torn to pieces
(turning back to ) You come in here and talk to these men about private justice
You dare to do that
Constable Haller, why don't you go out to Harmony Hill and dig up what's left of Brady and explain to him about private justice
Would you want to do that
makes no reply
He looks down at his feet
No
thought not
(to the others) You folks stay here if you want
wouldn't ask anyone to do anything that runs counter to his conscience
As for me
'm going out and hunt up a little private justice
has swelled up again
He grins poisonously at the slumped
He pushes off after
Other men start to follow
' Men are streaming out, getting into station wagons and pickup trucks
Engines roar into life
They begin backing out even as more men come out of the pub
We even hear some high-spirited yells; they are on their way and their blood is up
' , looking more distressed than ever, pushes his way through the men toward the door, and
He grabs  McCLAREN
Billy
Billy, this is a bad idea
Joe can
(not looking at ) Joe's had his chance, Father
Leave me be
He pushes outside
looks around wildly; his face says he can't believe this is happening
He grabs , then, as  shoves by him, at a couple of others with mounting desperation
makes his way to  through the thinning crowd and draws him aside
Let them go
But- This is that spirit of community you were talking about
Grand, ain't it
Maybe they'll shoot a hitchhiker or something and Andy can mount the head and raffle it off
To benefit the Medcu van, of course
laughs
But can't we do anything
hurries past them; he has a rifle over one shoulder in a sling
In his left hand he carries the peacemaker bat
Sure
We can pray to Christ that none of them get killed
' More cars and trucks pull away
There's a big old Ford "woody" wagon still there, with   standing impatiently by the driver's side door
McCLAREN and are with him, and a big, solid-looking woman named
comes out and crosses to the woody
Well, it's about frigging time
They'll have his hide tacked to somebody's barn door before we get out there
They pile into the car,  behind the wheel
He throws it into gear and backs out onto Main Street
, We see a parade of cars and pickup trucks headed out of town
He's standing on the curb and watching them leave town in procession, some honking their horns, others yelling cheerfully
The expression on his face is dark and brooding
, is lying on his belly, stuck halfway under a barbed-wire fence
The seat of his pants is badly snagged
The brothers are on the verge of a wooded area
We can see ground mist creeping around the bottoms of the trees
Help me Porter, goddammit
grabs ' right arm and pulls
There's a screams
Don't pull me
You want to rip the right cheek of my ass right off
Well, Elmer, there are folks that'd say you've been half-assed most of your- Are you going to unhook me or be a wise guy
begins to pick the barbed wire out of ' pants
,
' ' looks rather amusing in his hunting gear- like that priest from "The Exorcist" on safari
:  , Jesus, that was close
Uh, pardon me, Rev'runt
' Come on
Be careful
They move slowly ahead, ' still a bit in the lead
as the reverend pushes into some knee-high brush
:    , followed by a
' begins to scream and struggle
Rev'runt
What is it
' (screaming) My foot
My foot
lunges to him and looks down
'' , ' medium-sized trap- something in which one might reasonably catch a wild cat or a coydog, let us say- has its rusty teeth sunk deeply into the reverend's ankle
' ' () Get it off me
Get it off me
(flustered) Sure
okay
He kneels down
He muscles the trap open, a little at a time
' Relaxing
:
Startled and unnerved by the , the trap slips out of his hands and snaps shut on '' mangled ankle again
' He screams
, It slides behind a cloud
:
' ,  McCLAREN,  ,  , and have been joined by two other men-
and
They have drawn close together, listening as the
We can tell by their uneasy faces that some of the joy has gone out of the evening
They are standing on one side of a ravine
The bottom is filled with a still ground mist
few bushes poke out of it
There are woods on the far side
(pointing across) It came from over there
As far as  could tell, it could have come from anywhere
We'll spread out in a skirmish line
If the bastard tries to go around us, we'll hear him
dunno- think Bobby Robertson here's making lemonade in his pants
That lemonade got ice cubes in it, Bobby
and   laugh
and McCLAREN smile a little
(quietly) Let off him, Maggie
'm scared, too
(stoutly) ain't scared
Let's go
Okay
Spread out on me
Five feet apart
' , Reading from right to left:   (his gun is still over his shoulder; it is the peacemaker baseball bat he is holding),  , ,  , McCLAREN,   and
They come slowly down toward  , alert and ready for anything- at least, they think so
' , They reach the bottom of the ravine and begin to make their way across it
The mist is waist to chest deep
They push toward the other side
Now they are about halfway
:  ,  ,
They all stop, scared
McCLAREN Where's it coming from
Other side
No- it's behind us
told you you couldn't trust- It isn't on either side
What are you- is looking around, his eyes widening with fear
It's under the fog
It's right in with us
The
There's a beat of silence
Then: :
as dinner is served
:
, He's the one screaming, and if he reminds us of ', that's okay, because  has also been caught in a trap
He tries to run, stumbles, falls into the ground fog
He goes on screaming
We can see his back for a moment, and then it disappears
His hand and arm come up like the hand of a drowning man
Then it's gone
is gone
They stand there, chest deep in mist, a conspicuous hole in the ranks where  was
, (moaning) can't move
Christ Jesus,  can't move
, The The mist swirls, hiding whatever's beneath
, (low) think we better start backing up, Andy
Real slow
Real- The   rises to a snarl
And from below the mist, snarling and bestial but understandable, mocking ' voice: (voice) "Real slow
Real slow
Real slow
" :
and tries to run
He falls into the mist
There is another
When he flounders up, half his face is gone
(voice) "Real slow
Real slow
" hairy arm rises from the mist and yanks  down
' They panic and break for it- , , and  for one side,  and  for the other
, ' - this is like being in an airplane that's skimming the top of a cloud
(voice; laughing) "Real slow
Real slow
Real slow
" He's hit, as an unlucky swimmer might be hit by a shark
He whirls around, raising the peacemaker bat
Come on, then
You want to rock and roll with me
, ' For a moment there's nothing- and then the werewolf rises out of it, eyes glaring green, muzzle and pelt slimed with gore
"
" (shrieking) Look at it
Holy God, Andy, look at that thing
(groaning with fear) don't want to look at it
He runs, while  stares, mesmerized, at: The  closes in on , who belts it a good one with the peacemaker
The  swipes at him
ducks and slams it again
The  roars with anger
Come on, come on
You want to do the bop
'll bop you, motherfucker
Come on
The  dives under the ground mist
Uncertain,  begins to back up, holding the bat in his hands
is jerked down into the mist
He
The peacemaker rises out of the ground mist and comes down
Bonk
The  roars in pain shrieks
(voice) Come on, you bastard
The peacemaker rises out of the mist again
The hands holding it are bloody
Blood runs down the bat
It descends
Bonk
The  roars again
There is a from
and then a curious   as the sinks its fangs into the bat
as the  moves below, escaping down the draw
Pause
,
- low but slowly getting louder: a congregation singing "Bringing In the Sheaves" to the accompaniment of a pipe organ
(sing-songy voice) Bringing in the sheaves
bringing in the sheaves
we shall come rejoicing
bringing in the sheaves
; human voices singing the same hymn overwhelm it and we : , It's an almost exact reprise of #167
Most of the mourners are crying;
playing the organ; ' chair parked at the back
We can see  , , , and , exactly as they were at  ' funeral; in fact, this seems to be an instant reply of that event
One difference: we can't see ' coffin
It's below us
The hymn ends
, Mr
and Mrs
Kincaid have asked that there be no mass said here this afternoon
They did ask me to say a word of comfort to you if  could
, He sits in the first pew
In his grief he looks dead
There is no comfort, Father
Only private justice
, He's thrown off his stride
Beginning to sweat
He's like an actor trying to remember his lines
Uh, if there's any word of comfort  can give you, it's just this: the face of the beast always becomes known; the time- He looks down
His eyes widen in fear
, ' Yes, that's coffins- plural
Where ' coffin was formerly, there are now six coffins, smothered with flowers
, He is badly scared now; sweat is dripping off him
The time
the time of the beast always passes
There are answers
ways
ways to
to cope
if we turn to each other
(bestial voice) Father- looks toward: ,   , ' He's looking down at something in his hands
Now he looks up and we see his face has become bestial
His eyes are green
As we look at him, the transformation cotinues
He's turning into a werewolf
(snarling) It tore out his heart
And sure enough,   holds ' dripping heart up in what were hands but which are now rapidly becoming paws
, He staggers back, in terror
(shrieks) No
, ' begins bringing in a few more sheaves on the church organ, and the congregation begins to sing
Sowing in the morning/sowing seeds of kindness/sowing in the noontide/and the dewy eve
We pan their faces, stopping on
Now something is happening to ' face
It is bulging, changing
He looks up from his hymnal and his eyes glare green
The pupils are split
He grins, showing big teeth
They are all changing
Among the things we see are: , who is a church deacon, rushing down the aisle, changing, snarling
He grabs   and the two of them grapple in the aisle
with a baby in her arms turns back the blanket covering the baby's face and we see it's a wolfling; already the  ' own hands are turning into claws
changing;  the druggist changing; the   changing
At the organ,
is now a werewolf clad in tatters of a silk bombazine dress; she/it is still wearing a veiled hat on her head, and she is beating the shit out of the organ keys with her clawed hands
She sounds like Jerry Lee Lewis after swallowing about a dozen bennies
And now the tune changes from the remnants of "Bringing In The Sheaves
" It changes into the Rheingold jingle
(snarling chorus) My beer is Rheingold the dry beer
Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer
goes stumbling backward, dropping his hymnal
The man is in an extremity of terror
No
No
No
, ' Some are tearing their hymnals apart and throwing them at each other
One guy-  McCLAREN, maybe- wings one of them through a stained-glass window
Some of the werewolves- for they are all werewolves now- fight or make love in the aisles
The rest sway back and forth, grinning ferociously, singing
(snarling it out) It's not bitter, not sweet, it's a real frosty treat
He looks toward: , She grins ferociously up at him, playing the Rheingold jingle on the pipe organ with her claws
Now blood begins to bubble up between the keys
Won't you try, won't you buy
The church is a wild shambles of lurching, fighting, singing werewolves
It's like a New Year's Eve party in hell
(big finish) Rheiinngold beer
Suddenly a clawed hand burts up through one of the coffins
And  , who now looks as wolflike as any of them, bites the hand's claw off
, He's seen all he can stand
He whirls for the back, where there is a small door
He pulls it open
and a werewolf, half torn apart but still somehow alive (a zombie werewolf, if you can dig it- George Romero would like it,  think) leaps out and seizes
buries his muzzle in '
, He sits up into   and
Sweat is running down his face
He stares at us for a moment, his eyes buggy and crazed
and then he closes them
There is an expression of huge relief on his face as he does so
(praying) Let it end, dear Lord
Let it end
Please let it end
An old sedan cruises slowly down the street
and are in the front seat
It's piled high with possessions and is towing a jackleg trailer with more stuff in it
(indifferently) Anne Sturmfuller and her little girl
Yeah
but what are they doing
Putting on my Sherlock Holmes deerstalker cap,  deduce that they are leaving
,  ' They are headed out of town all right, but the thing which perhaps strikes us the most forcibly is how empty this place is now
Main Street looks like a ghost town
, She's not the only one
Lot of people leaving town
And  guess if we want a beer, we'll have to drink it at home
He nods toward: ' ,  (  ' ) sign hangs in the door; above it is a big black wreath
Joe, what's wrong with you
ain't never seen you like this
(thoughtful) lost my guts
(startled) Bullshit
It was the Kincaid boy
looked at him
and  felt it happen
It was no big deal
No worse than pissing down your own leg
You ever do that
Maybe when you were real scared
, distressed, does not respond
One minute  had me some guts- as much as the next man, anyhow- and then, poof
Gone
' looking at him in a kind of terror
Joe
you are going to feel better than this
This
this feeling of yours
it's gonna pass
Is it
He walks away, back toward the Municipal Building (the sign out front reminds folks to
) while looks after him, very deeply troubled
It's deserted
Rides stand still
The midway is deserted
slowly to a sign which reads ' 1    10c cheerful enough sign, except for the strip of paper glued diagonally across it:
(voice) It's not fair
It's parked across the road from the sign
(voice) Look out, world
Marty the Great didn't get something he wanted
They are distributed just as they were when they arrived at this same fairgrounds earlier
All of them have ice cream cones; they are coming home from a family outing
Stop it, Jane
Well,  don't see why everybody just about breaks down and cries whenever he- Stop it, your mother said
They've just paused for a quick look at the sign; now pulls out onto the road again and heads toward home
sticks her tongue out at him
looks away
' sports car is parked in the driveway
We hear the of a wrench on the cement inside
and  are working on the engine of the Silver Bullet
has a six-pack of beer that he's working through
He and  sit on the floor
As they talk, unscrews the last bolt holding the Bullet's carburetor and pulls it off
It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady
Now he's got them to cancel the fair
And the fireworks
Hand me that box, Marty
hands him a medium-sized carton with the words "Speed Shop" printed on it
Yeah, okay, the fireworks
Jane thinks that's all 'm mad about, but it's not
Them doing that is just a
a
It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town
Not bad, huh
read Sherwood Anderson in college
can jive that shit all day
Well
like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al
'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that
Don't call me dear boy
But you are, you know- you are my dear boy
He gives  a kiss and smiles at him
smiles back
Look at this
He pulls out a brand-new carburetor- it's a chrome-plated four-barrel
(gleeful) This is gonna turn your wheelchair into a fucking -14, Marty- He looks around quickly, guiltily
Your mom's not around, is she
She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue
Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain
Like always
Uh-huh
Only in her case  guess it would be Queen Shit of Turd Mountain
Hand me that adjustable
does
slides the carb onto the gasket and starts attaching bolts
The guy killed your best friend, drove your girl out of town, and stole the second-best holiday in the year
Have  got it right
(glum) You got it right, Uncle Al
Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that
but  got something that just might cheer you up
What
Wait, dear boy
Just wait
Hand me those pliars
, He peeks into the backyard
,  ' and  are fussing over the barbecue
is hitting a badminton birdie
', is sitting in the Silver Bullet
comes hurrying back from his look-see
All is cool, Marty-boy
Go for it
pushes the starter
The engine starts at once, but the tone is entirely different
Before, ' wheelchair was a poppety-popping pussycat
Now the engine rumbles like a hood's street rod idling at a traffic light
looks startled
(grinning) Gun it
guns it
The engine roars
Jesus
Not too much
(awed) Wow
You got a pilot's license, Marty
Do  need one
We're gonna find out
Take it down the road a ways and back
Be careful
puts the Bullet in gear and pulls away
, up the road
He goes slowly at first, but he lets it out a little after a while
He's really moving along- thirty, maybe forty miles an hour
The wind blows the hair off his forehead
He begins to grin
He's enjoying this
, He drinks some beer
He's grinning, happy for
, He slows down, turns, stops
He revs the engine
' , lot of changes back here
It looks almost like a motorcyle engine now
That chromed-silver carb predominates
:
, Grinning
Looking at: , ' It's about a quarter of a mile away
, He winds the engine up and pops the clutch
The Silver Bullet doesn't so much accelerate as blast off
It tilts back on its wheels
swivels into a position like that of an astronaut on lift-off
The Silver Bullet looks like a motorcycle popping a wheelie
has a great big grin on his face
, - Roaring down the highway at fifty or better, blue smoke jetting from the exhaust
is plastered back in the seat with the footrest pointing up at an angle
He's laughing like a lunatic
, (to himself) The kid's dead meat
What have  done
(shouts) Put a rock in it, Marty
He uses the hand brakes
of braking and squealing rubber
The Silver Bullet comes to a screeching, sluing stop near Blue smoke drifts up from the wheels
guns the engine once and then lets it idle
You gave me a heart attack, Marty
'm dying
hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man
It really goes fast
Thanks, Uncle Al
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty,  will have a new job
Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir
don't get you
know you don't
But  want this to be our secret
You get that, don't you
Sure
Good
, The last bit of daylight is just filtering away
The barbecue is over
and  are putting lawn chairs on the back porch
, , and   are all in the f
g
've got to go, Nan-  had a wonderful time
He kisses her cheek affectionately, and she smiles at him
So have , actually
wish it could always be like this
See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure stay out of trouble at least that long
Okay
He and   go around to the driveway
looks at them with troubled love
, Now  said  had something for you, as believe you will recall
Yeah
What is it
unlocks the trunk of his car and brings out a paper shopping bag
He places the bag in ' lap
opens the bag, but it's really too dark to see inside
He reaches in and brings out a handful of assorted fireworks- crackers, Roman candles, twizzers, smoke bombs, etc
An expression of sublime delight fills ' face as he inventories these goodies
You're gonna have the Fourth of July in October, Marty
Just don't blow your head off
(Pause) And remember that it isn't just the fireworks
It's because no crazy shithead should be able to stop the good guys, if you can dig that
(respectfully) can dig it- thank you, Uncle Al
Thank you
Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people
have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know
Yeah,  know
It's great
One of the reasons  love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as  am
Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay
Just bright colors
Can you tell the difference
Yeah
sure
Save this one for last
He brings out a short rocket with stubby vanes on the end fat fuse sticks out behind the head
What is it
tracer
You'll like it
Thanks a million, Uncle Al
You're welcome a million, Marty
Stick 'em in the bushes for now
motors over to the side of the garage, where there's a line of bushes, and conceals the bag in them
gets in his car and starts it up
comes back
(grinning) Have a good time, dear boy
And watch out for the werewolves
He leaves
sits in his wheelchair, waving
There's a downspout outside one of the upstairs windows
Now the window goes up and  leans out
He grasps the downspout and begins working his way down
This should not be too hard for us to believe; we've already seen how strong ' arms are
His legs dangle limply, but he's doing just fine
When he reaches the bottom of the drainpipe, they simply crumple under him and he uses his arms to pull himself over to the back porch
hoists himself over the porch rail
Here, under a tarp, is the Silver Bullet
pushes the tarp aside and gets in
He uses his hands on the wheels to get over the porch ramp and rolls silently down it
At the bottom he looks up at: , ' Still a light on up there
, (whispers) Shit
Thinks a bit, then starts to hand-roll the Bullet toward: comes slowly up the path
We hear soft grunts of exertion; he's still hand-turning the wheels for the sake of silence, and it's hard work
He stops at the line of bushes and gets the bag of fireworks
He puts it on his lap and starts moving again
, The driveway has a slight downslant, and  coasts easily out to the road
He turns right and begins to roll slowly along the verge of the highway, still using his hands
We can see that the light is still on upstairs
turns back once to verify this himself, then keeps on going
He's not going to be deprived of his treat
He decides he's far enough away to be safe
He pushes the starter button
The engine cranks, coughs, and cranks some more
frowns, and pulls out a wire- a rudimentary choke,  suppose
He pushes the starter button again
It cranks, but doesn't start
pushes in the wire, looking concerned now, and tries again
This time, after the engine has cranked over a few times, it starts
(softly) All right
He puts it in gear and starts off
,  , What we see is a tiny boy in a tiny wheelchair moving along a dark, empty ribbon of road under a vast dome of stars
: The Bullet's engine
: Fast-rushing water
The turnout is packed dirt
There's a grove of trees with picnic tables spotted among them at the back
The sign in the extreme f
g
reads    at the top; in the middle;   '  at the bottom
: The Silver Bullet approaching
turns in and rolls to the back of the rest area
He stops by one of the picnic tables and dumps the bag of fireworks out onto the picnic table and takes his time selecting the first- he's like a wine fancier with a whole cellar of rare bottles to choose from
At last he chooses a twizzer
He takes matches from the pocket of his pajama top and lights the fuse
When it starts to fizz,  tosses it high into the air
(soft) Here's one for the good guys
It flies in an arc over the drop
, onto some rocks at the edge of the waterfall's catch pool
: Growling
, It has been drinking from the creek
It looks more than half human now- we would be able to recognize it for sure, but its face is in shadow
It turns from the creek and gets up on its hind legs
, It's guttering out
hand-paw touches it and draws back quickly
: Hurt, angry growl
, He's getting ready to light one of the fountains
He pauses and looks toward the cut
He's heard something- but the waterfall muffles it
He lights the fountain's fuse, sets it on the ground, and rolls the Bullet back a few feet
The fountain bursts into a shower of light
(delighted) All right
, The waterfall is in the b
g
The  is climbing the rocky slope
, It goes out
He rolls over to the picnic table and gets a Roman candle
He plants the stick in the ground and lights the fuse
The Roman candle shoots into the sky
Bursts into colored light
,      , It
and shakes its fists at the fading light in the sky
He's holding another fountain in one hand and his matches in the other
He's looking toward the cut and the waterfall
Is someone there
, It freezes,
With a little shrug, he lights the fuse on the fountain and sets it on the ground, as before
, Claw-hands settle over the top
, It throws off fiery swirls of sparks, then begins to die down
He's checking out the stuff on the table for his next choice when he hears a clear :  ,
, It's run into a low-hanging branch
Instead of pushing it aside or ducking under it, it simply rips it off the tree
Although the branch is pretty big, the  does this as easily as a hungry man might rip a drumstick off a Thanksgiving turkey
It throws the branch aside and advances, hunched over on two legs
(terrified) Who's there
, ' The grove is a darkened shadowland
He punches the Bullet's starter
The motor cranks and cranks
No go, though
pulls out the choke wire, alternating terrified stares at the grove of trees with terrified stares at his rudimentary dashboard
, ' Here it comes, out of the shadows, closing in
Working that starter for all it's worth
but the motor only cranks
Still no start
, He gives up on the motor
He looks toward the picnic table where the fireworks are
He grabs up the tracer
He gets the matches out of the breast pocket of his p
j
's and promptly drops them in his lap
He scrabbles for them
, ' We can't see its face in the dark, but it's closer
much closer
He tries to hold the tracer and strike a match at the same time
He can't; to do that he'd need at least one more hand
He puts the tube of the tracer between his teeth and tries again
' He strikes the match
too hard
It bends, the neck broken
(voice; moaning) Oh, please
, He is in an extremity of terror
' , He pulls a fresh match from the book and strikes it
It lights
It recoils- we still can't see its face except for a vague shadow
(:  keep emphasizing the shadowed face, because this is not a full-moon period
've been going on the assumption that the guy kind of works his way up to full wolfiness, toothiness, hairiness, etc
, starting with a partial change at about the second quarter
It's a process like the tide coming in
Thus, if we saw ' attacker clearly at this point,  think we would recognize him
) , He takes the tracer from his mouth and applies the match to the fuse
It splutters alight
, The  is less than twenty feet away
The tracer flares alight and shoots out of ' hand, leaving a pink-orange trail of smoke behind it
The missile flies at the 's head
The tracer strikes it in the face, and we see a flash of fire
The  screams and blunders away
, He punches the starter again
The motor cranks
The motor coughs and fires; a big blue flame jumps from the fancy carb
and the engine starts to run
It's staggering away,  and
The tube of the tracer is sticking out of its face- from its left eye, in fact- like an Indian's arrow
The  smashes branches out of its way
He wheels the Bullet around and heads for the road, gasping and weeping with fear
, It's blundering through the trees
It pulls the tube from its face with an   and drops it
, It lies smoldering on the ground
The end is slick with blood
, The Bullet is really wheeling
is panting, out of breath, still deeply frightened
, We see it blundering along, holding its face; blood bubbles through its fingers
(snarling voice) Bastard Marty
Bastard Marty
Kill you
Reeeal slow
, He powers up it, and along the path to the back
Perhaps he has enough speed to cut the engine and coast
' His bed is by the window
His hands appear on the windowsill, and  pulls himself in
He falls over onto his bed and lies there, spent and exhausted and trembling
, :   () , He's sitting in the "house" wheelchair in the living room, holding the phone tensely to his ear as the goes on
as the phone is picked up
(muzzy voice) 'Lo
Go away
It's a werewolf
saw it
Last night- ' Not a really spiffy place- the decor is Early American Alcoholic
There's a mostly unclad lady asleep on one side of the bed
is sitting on the other in his skivvies, phone to his ear
There are a lot of bottles and heaped ashtrays around, and   has a big old hangover
You dreamed it, Marty
(voice) No
went out late last night- and- There are no such things as werewolves
Please, dear boy, have some pity
He hangs up and falls back into bed
(muzzy voice) Whowuzzit
Obscene phone caller
Go back to sleep
, He's sitting on the Silver Bullet, just looking at the yard
comes out
Marty
You okay
You've just been sitting here all morning
Where's Mom
Went shopping
Why
Jane,  have to talk to you
(mistrustfully) About what
looks at her earnestly
need you to help me
Uncle Al won't believe me, and if you won't help me,
has to stop
He's almost crying
(concerned) Marty, what is it
,  , is pushing a supermarket shopping cart with a lot of beer and soda bottles in it
On the side is a sign reading - plus an outline drawing of the Medcu unit
(voice-over) He told me something that was clearly unbelievable
and yet, somehow believed most of it
And  understood one thing with total clarity: Marty himself believed it all
She turns into a yard and pulls her cart up the walk to the door
She mounts the steps and rings the bell
,  , sheer curtain at one side of the door is pulled aside and a fearful face- that of
- looks out
Then we hear bolts being pulled and locks- at least three of them- being unlocked
The lady is taking no chances
Jane
(politely) 'm collecting returnable bottles and cans for the Medcu Drive, Missus Thayer- just wondered if you had any
Her husband comes up the hall
Who is it
Jane Coslaw
What we see mostly are her eyes- bright, inquiring
Hi, Mr
Thayer
, What we see mostly are his brown eyes
Hello, Jane
, Bring your cart around to the back, Jane- we'll look in the garage
Thank you
She starts down the steps and we : , Amazing how deserted Tarker's Mills looks
is pushing her cart
Even more bottles in it now
(voice-over) Uncle Al hadn't believed him, but Uncle Al was thirty-five that summer and  was fourteen
at fourteen you can still believe the unbelievable, although even then that ability is growing rusty, is preparing to squeal to a stop
She is passing the Holy Family rectory
is out front, digging in his flower garden
He is shirtless, back to  and to us; his black shirt with the turned-around collar hangs informally on a bush
(calls) Hi, Father Lowe
(without turning) Top of the morning to you, Jane Coslaw
'm going to bring in a monster load of bottles in an hour or so
(still digging) That's great, Jane
'll be waiting
, She stops at Robertson's Luncheonette, leaves her cart outside, and goes in
; we see  explaining about the bottle campaign to  while a few men seated at the counter listen
, Wide eyes, mostly
, Mostly eyes
', As she turns away, her eyes sweep the men at the counter
, ' Some of them- ,  - are familiar
Others are not
, ', She grabs the handle of the cart again and proceeds down Main Street
She goes into the barber shop
(v-o) Marty had seen where the tracer had struck home, he said, and  went out that day doing more than just looking for returnable cans and bottles-  was looking for a man- or woman- with only one eye
As  enters,  McCLAREN is giving one man a trim
Another man is tipped back with his face wrapped in a towel
Two or three other townies are waiting on tonsorial beautification, reading magazines
None, of course, has only one eye
checks them all out carefully
know what you're after, Jane, and you're out of luck
Little Toby Whittislaw was in yesterday, and  gave 'em all to him
Oh
okay
But her eyes have fixed on the towel over the face of the man in the other barber chair
She walks over to him
, That you, Mr
Fairton
(muffled) No- it's Ronald McDonald
came in for a shave and a burger
The men laugh
smiles politely
And pulls the hot towel away from his eyes
His two eyes
(sweetly) Got any bottles, Mr
Fairton
No
(just as sweet) Oh
okay
She puts the towel back and    as she returns to the door
'Bye, Mr
McClaren
(amused) 'Bye, Jane
(muffled) Jesus
goes out
, She pushes the shopping cart up to the gate, opens it, and goes up the walk to the foot of ' porch steps
She leaves it there and climbs to the porch
, The screen door is shut, the inner wooden door open
, ' Dark and empty
in the kitchen
, maybe- or maybe we can't tell
, She knocks on the screen door
Father Lowe
'm ready to turn in my bottles and cans
is standing by the refrigerator door
He's holding a raw leg of lamb and tearing at it with his teeth
Lamb blood smears his face and runs down his arms
He is as human as you or me (in a manner of speaking, as   would say), but when  speaks, his head snaps up and his eye flares- his one eye
The other is covered by a patch
(voice) Father
Take your cart around to the garage and unload, Jane
Then bring me your tally sheet
, Okay
, She goes down the steps and starts to push the cart around the house
, He crosses to the window over the kitchen sink, the bloody chunk of meat still in his hands, and looks out
, ' She pushes the cart along a path toward a combination garage and utility shed at the back
, Still watching , he begins to gnaw ravenously at the meat again
,   - She opens the door and slowly pushes her cart inside
-, This is a creepy little place, now filled with bottles and cans that have been crammed in helter-skelter, every which way
obviously doesn't like it
She begins to unload her cart rapidly, mumbling numbers to herself
:
looks down
- , ' good-sized mouse comes out from between a pile of stacked bottles and runs across ' shoe
She utters a litle scream and shrinks back against the wall, bumping it quite hard
Hard enough to knock something off an overhead shelf
It falls into the bottles, several
screams again- not terribly loud- and then slowly bends toward the object and picks it up
holds it, both puzzled and scared
approaches it, holding a piece of paper in her hand- her tally sheet
She knocks
Waits
There is no answer
She knocks again
Waits
No answer
She tries the door
It opens
Father Lowe
No answer
After a moment of interior debate,  enters the kitchen
, She looks around
No one here
But there is a bloody spot on the counter-  must have set his grisly luncheon down here for a moment
She walks slowly across the kitchen and into the dark hall
Father Lowe
've got my tally sheet
Farther into the hall
hand drops onto her shoulder
(voice) Very good, Jane
She jumps, and so do we
She turns around and looks up at: , Featuring his eyes- his eye, rather
The left is covered with a black eye-patch
(grins) Good, Jane
Very
very good
He holds his hand out, and  puts the tally sheet in it like one in a dream
She can't take her eyes off that black patch, which tells her everything
, (concerned) Jane
You're trembling
don't feel so well,  guess maybe  got too much sun
Would you like to come in the parlor and lie down for a bit
Or have a cold drink
have some soda- No
(softer) That is,  have to get home and help my mom with lunch
'll give you a ride
is retreating down the hall toward the front door
No- she
she was going to meet me at the market
'll be fine
, How much does he know
How much has he guessed
Hard to tell from his face, which now seems sinister, with its eye-patch
Give my best to your brother, Jane
, will
She bolts
, , standing silent and enigmatic
(soft) Real slow
, His eyes are wide
He's leaning forward in his wheelchair
(almost moaning) Oh, Jeez
What did you do then
She's changed into shorts and a blouse
ran faster than  ever ran in my life- what do you think, dummox
By the time got back here,  really thought  was going to faint
(Pause) What are we going to do, Marty
If we tried to tell anybody- grown-ups,  mean- they'd laugh
What are we going to do
(thoughtfully) think  know
, hand- '- comes into the frame and prints: ,
' , He's sitting at his desk, a pool of light from the lamp focused on the sheet of paper before him
He thinks a moment, then begins to write again
, He is adding:  '
, He studies this for a second, and seems satisfied
He opens a drawer, brings out an envelope, and folds his letter into it
, She has the letter in her hand
She approaches the mailbox, opens the mailbox door, and then glances at the envelope again
, ' Addressed in pencil, it says:   / ; 149  /' ,
, She drops the letter in with the air of a girl lighting the fuse on a packet of high explosives
She turns away toward home
, He's standing at the window and looking out
The torn-open envelope is on an end table beside him
He's holding the lined sheet of paper in his hand
An expression of bitter hate twists his features, and he slowly crumples the paper in his fist
, She drops in another letter and walks away
(v-o) mailed another letter for Marty the next day
a third the day after that
Then, on Saturday
'  , Parked at the curb is  ' sports car
(v-o) we told Uncle Al what we'd been up to
(Pause) His reaction was less than serene
, ,  , Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-
Uncle Al- (to ) From him 'd expect it
sometimes think his common sense got paralyzed along with his legs
But you, Jane
You
Little Polly Practical
(quiet) You don't understand
(wildly) Oh,  understand plenty
understand that my niece and nephew are sending the local Catholic priest little love notes suggesting that he gargle with a broken light bulb or eat a rat-poison omelet
It came for me
shot it in the eye
Now he's wearing an eye-patch
called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty
Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution
That's a fancy way of saying eyewash
He's got a corneal inflammation
Was it a prescription
What the hell does that matter
It wasn't- 'll bet you it wasn't
Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself
Well
was it a prescription
don't know
But  know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty
You had a dream, that's all
An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town
What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed
You know who used to have a baseball bat like that
Mr
Knopfler
He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade
Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick
You want to know what  think
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face
Watch it, dear boy
think it was a hallucination
Probably a broomstick, or something
(indignant) It was not
You want me to show you
Come on
'm not afraid
'll show you right now
No thank you, Jane
'm a little old for palying the Hardy Boys Meet the Catholic Werewolf

Never mind, Jane
He'll have gotten rid of it by now anyway
' The Silver Bullet stands outside
The door opens and , , and  come out
is carrying piggyback
has an ice cream cone
is holding two
squats, depositing  in the Bullet starts the engine as  hands   his ice cream cone
The three of them start up the street and If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters
don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane
Because  don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair
Why hasn't he picked up the phone and told Constable Haller that someone is sending him poison-pen letters
stops
He hasn't thought of this
He looks toward: ,  -  ' is mowing the lawn, eye-patch and all
,   , , (a bit perplexed) Well
he probably did
mean, he could make a complaint without taking an ad out in the paper, couldn't he
'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription
And 'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to Mr
Haller
Marty, do you see your suspect
, Keeps on moving
drives by and waves waves back
,   , , (grim) Yes,  see him
Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn
He'd either be in the hospital
or dead
didn't shoot him when he was a man
shot him when he was- When he was a werewolf
Yes
Right
Jesus
Jane, you don't really believe this madness, do you
don't know exactly what  believe
But know that what  saw was a baseball bat and not a broomstick
know there was something strange about the way the house smelled that day
It smelled like an animal's den
And believe in Marty
mean- there are times when he makes me so mad  could kill him, but still believe in him
(Pause) You used to believe in him, too, Uncle Al
looks momentarily ashamed of himself
Then he throws his hands up in disgust
Kids
He walks ahead of them
bats his eyes sweetly at
She walks on, miffed
gooses the Silver Bullet to catch up
It's midafternoon
bunch of kids are playing baseball
In the extreme f
g
we see one small boy- - sitting back to us in his wheelchair, watching
It draws slowly along a tree-lined lane and stops is behind the wheel
,  , ' '
(quietly) Little bastard
, The field team heads in
Kids start streaming back toward town
The  who caught the fly trots past, and glances his way
You comin' down to Robertson's for a soda, Marty
No-  guess 'll go home
think that here we are seeing a rare moment of depression in - they can run and play ball
He can't
Okay- seeya
Yeah
seeya
He fires up the Bullet and starts away alone
' He starts it up
, ' He bumps up a grassy slope to a tarred road
The last of the other kids are headed back the other way
is alone
' It turns out of the lane where it was parked and onto the road
' , ' ' back is to us
The wheelchair draws rapidly closer to   as  bears down on it
,   ' He leans over the wheel, grinning sadistically
(whispers) Bastard
, He's daydreaming his way along- maybe, inside his head, he's playing center field for the Dodgers
: Winding roar of a car engine
turns around
' , ' , ' opens the throttle wide and the Bullet swerves across the road
The coupe's bumper actually clips it on the way by, jolting  and almost overturning the Bullet
' coupe veers over the embankment and partway down into the ditch
, Oh, you bastard
He floors the engine
' Spinning helplessly in the dirt
, He speeds past the coupe, and thumbs his nose
, He's in a teeth-grinding fury
He jams the gear-shift lever into reverse and floors the gas pedal again
It roars backward in a cloud of ditch dust and bounces onto the road
Then it screams out after the rapidly disappearing Silver Bullet
, He hears the   of  ' coupe
He looks behind
Roars toward
, He twists the throttle and the Silver Bullet responds
The director will shoot it as he likes- the basis is simple: is chasing 's hopped-up wheelchair along a country road at speeds approaching fifty
should have a couple of near misses, and perhaps we could actually have him pass one car
At one point we should have a on  ' coupe, featuring two bumper stickers: and As the chase goes on it becomes apparent that  is gaining
looks increasingly desperate
And now he looks down at: '  , ' The needle is all the way over on "
" He groans
of the coupe's engine
charges, rapidly closing the distance
swerves from one side of the road to the other, escaping  for the moment but almost overturning in the process
They are now running beside a river- the Auger River, in fact
' Now the needle is actually past "
" Come on, baby
come on
His face registers hope as he sees: , ' 2000 , He twists the throttle as far as it will turn- he's going for broke
The coupe chases him- and now the Silver Bullet's motor
, ' It's pretty ramshackle
big orange sign beside it reads: brakes, hits the shoulder of the road, and somehow makes the turn
We see him holding on for dear life as the Silver Bullet bounces and jounces down the dirt road to the mouth of the covered bridge
' It overshoots the right turn  just took, screeches to a halt, backs up, and turns onto the lane
It bounces up the incline to the bridge, It comes to a sliding, dirt-digging stop
, His face is so full of frustrated hate that it has become the face of a gargoyle
, ' /
, It's dim and spooky in here
Cracks between the boards of the side walls allow dusty fingers of daylight to shine through
More light rays up from the cracks in the floor
The floorboards are warped and uneven; ' wheelchair sways drunkenly from side to side
The total inside passage is about seventy feet
About halfway across, the Silver Bullet coughs its last cough and splutters its last splutter
It rolls along silently, going on its dying momentum
, ' Drawing closer
We hear the  of boards rumbling under the Silver Bullet's tires and the Auger River beneath
, Rolling ever more slowly, the Silver Bullet approaches and stops
is covered with sweat
His hair is in a wild tangle
He's panting
He looks at: , ' This is an extremely rustic lane
Pretty, but hardly the sort of place in which one would want to find oneself when one has a part-time werewolf and a full-time homicidal maniac close behind
, (soft voice) Marty
' head whips around
, ' We see a brilliant square of light
In it stands ' silhouette
The silhouette begins to move
of footfalls on the loose floorboards of the covered bridge
' Sensible black Oxfords
'm very sorry about this
don't know if you believe that or not, but it's true would never willingly hurt a child
You should have left me alone, Marty
of footfalls resumes
He's nearly paralyzed with terror- even if he wasn't, he wouldn't get far in a powerless Silver Bullet
, (soft; soothing) can't kill myself, Marty
You see, our religion teaches that suicide is the greatest sin a man or a woman can commit
Stella Randolph was going to commit suicide; if she had done so, she would be burning in hell right now
By killing her  took her physical life but saved her life eternal
You see, Marty
You see how all things serve the will and the mind of God
You see, you meddling little shit
He begins to walk forward again
, ' He's halfway across the bridge now, walking slowly, not hurrying
You're going to have a terrible accident, Marty
You're going to fall into the river
:
stops, alert to possible danger
' face fills with hope
He looks from  toward: , ' gets louder still, and here comes on a John Deere
The tractor is hauling a manure spreader which is mostly empty

Zinneman
Mr
Zinneman

Stay and try to bluff it out, or beat it

Well
it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws
Also,  checked on the otic solution
It was counter brand
No prescription needed

Shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed
(sits down) Did you talk to the constable
After Marty called me with his latest Thrilling Tale of Wonder,  did
(Pause) He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all
told you
Shut up, Marty
(reluctantly) There's something else
What is it
What other thing
probably shouldn't tell you- you're both hysterical on the subject
'm starting to feel like a guy handing out free Arthur Murray coupons to victims of the dancing sickness
Uncle Al, if you don't tell me- He makes strangling gestures
(reluctant) went out to that rest area
(triumph) You found the tracer
No
but  found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove
There
You see
It could have been anything, Marty
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down
You don't think that was a dream, do you
No

In it, becomes steadily more uncomfortable
That's just about the craziest damn story 've ever heard, Al
know
could have edited out all of the completely crazy stuff, but  thought you deserved to hear it with the bark on

Now, the next question: Do you believe any of this
You do, don't you
Let's just say  believe Lester Lowe should be checked out

That can be arranged
They shake hands

We want the audience to notice these boots, remember them- probably  should wear them all through the picture
He goes up the walk
rings the doorbell
No one comes
rings the bell again
Waits
No one comes
He leans down and looks through a side window
, ' No one there
He goes down the steps, stands on the path for a moment, and then goes over to the shed-garage
He opens the door and looks in

There's just room for it amid the shadowy piles of bottles and cans

He lights it and looks at: , One of the turn-signal lamps is broken

' fingers come into the frame and touch the scratch
They stop, and to a small streak of silvery paint
As has a scrape of blue car paint on his wheelchair, so does have a scrape of silver wheelchair paint on his car
His eyes widen

The three of them are sitting in the grove of trees
Mr
Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what
No one sees him again
And what do you suggest  do about it, dear boy
slips off his St
Christopher's medallion and hands it to
want you to turn this into a silver bullet
You're not going to let it go, are you
saw what  saw
Marty, the moon wasn't even full
(quietly) In the made-up stories, the guy who's the werewolf only changes when the moon is full
But maybe he's really that way almost all the time, only as the moon gets fuller
(finishes) the guy gets wolfier

Take mine, too
Jane
you don't have to do that
Don't tell me what  have to do and what don't, booger-brains
Will you marry me, Jane
Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with
don't know
Maybe he doesn't know, either
No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it
The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit
French Jesuit

Not just because  know who he is, but because  hurt him
Only  don't think he'll try again as Lowe
Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind
Will you do it

We can see one cowboy boot sticking out of a wall of sand
It's bloody and chewed
The wagon pulls in

Will you
The St
Cristopher's medal and the crucifix are hanging from the rearview on a fine silver chain

All right

Yes
All right

Thank you, Uncle Al

)   pulls up to a city store front with a sign reading '
He takes out the St
Cristopher's medal, looks at it, and shakes his head, as if still ruing his own credulity and stupidity
He goes inside
(voice-over) Uncle Al's friend Mac was more than a gunsmith; he was, Uncle Al said, an old-world craftsman, a sort of wizard of weapons
b
) In the gun shop interior, we see   talking to , who really should look like an elderly white wizard- a kind of Gandalf figure
In the b
g
window we see a paper skeleton and paper jack-o'-lanterns: our first clue that All Hallow's Eve is nearing
is speaking animatedly, using his hands a lot; we don't know exactly what the tale is, but it must be a whopper
In the course of it, he hands the medal and the crucifix to , who tents the silver chains over his fingers and looks at them
(v-o continues) God knows what sort of story my uncle told him, but  think that for men who have been married as often as Uncle Al, invention on short notice becomes something of a specialty
c

(v-o continues) The gunsmith confirmed the high-grade silver content of my crucifix and Marty's medallion

(v-o concludes) and molded them into a silver bullet

He puts it down on the glass counter top
Here it is
, ' hands open it, disclosing a single bullet resting on dark velvet plush
It is a
22 short round, and it gleams a pure silver
It would be great to hype this bullet optically- not much, just a little- to make it look absolutely magical
Almost holy
picks up the bullet almost reverently, holds it to the light
Nicest piece of work  ever did,  think
It's got a low-grain load so it won't tumble
Should be pretty accurate
It's just a gag, that's all
What would you shoot a silver
22 bullet at, anyway
(joking) How about a werewolf
(Pause) Happy Halloween, Al
, It nearly fills the screen, swimming mysteriously in the warm summer air
(voice-over) By the time Marty's silver bullet was done, it was Halloween
and the full moon had come around again
Earlier that afternoon, my grandfather, who had been dying of cancer for over seven years, finally finished the job
to the  house
There's a carved jack in the window and a corsage of Indian corn on the door
'  is in the driveway
The  station wagon is just backing out
and  stand in the doorway; is slightly behind them in the Silver Bullet
leans out of the car
She's wearing black, and she has obviously been crying
Remember, Al
we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston tomorrow night
Or at the funeral parlor
It's Stickney and- -and Babcock,  remember
Now go on
The station wagon backs farther and  leans out again
And don't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come
We won't
The station wagon backs out into the road and  pops out again
You kids go to bed on time
You've got school tomorrow
If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy
Give my love to Mama- tell her 'll see her Thursday
will- be good, kids
'Bye, mom
Bye, dad
We will
'Bye
The station wagon accelerates away
Can  tell you kids something
Sure, Uncle Al
When me and sissy were kids, we were just like you two
Yeah
Really
Yeah
Really
The bitch of it is, we still are
Learn from your elders, dearies
He ushers them inside and closes the door
, can't believe that you'd agree to leave the kids with him
year ago  would have laughed at the idea
You used to almost breathe fire when Al came in the house
He's changed
Just this summer
Or something's changed him
Marty, maybe
And the drinking-  think it's almost stopped
Whatever it is, it's wonderful
And they'll be safe with him
'm sure of it
know they'll be safe with him
but will he get them both into bed by nine-thirty

,  ' He is also dozing
There are three or four empty beer cans in front of him, and a cigarette with a long ash is smoldering between his fingers
There's a
22 pistol in his lap
, The  breaks from the woods and runs across the side yard to a line of high bushes that runs along the side of the house (this is the opposite side from ' bedroom)
, There is a space in here between the house and the bushes- it's like an animal's run
The  creeps along this, its one eye flaring
,  , , jumps up and cries out as the cigarette burns up to his fingers
The
22 falls onto the rug
and  also wake up, startled

Foam begins to drip from its jaws
It creeps slowly along toward a window ,  , , is shaking his burned hand; he picks the cigarette out of his lap and puts it out

You kids ought to go up to bed
But Uncle Al
You said- know what  said, Marty- but it's ten past one

The moon's not down yet
Damn near
Now 'll sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because  promised, but you two are going to bed
Go on, now, scoot

What if  say no
Then 'd have to kick your ass, dear boy
(more kindly) Go on, now
begins to roll the Silver Bullet toward the stairs, where the stair chair awaits
is waiting for him at the living-room doorway
sees the gun on the floor and stops
If that'd gone off, it would have been the end of our silver bullet
He prickles a bit at the unstated criticism
He bends down and picks up the pistol
He opens the cylinder
Five chambers are empty; in one there's a bright silver circle
He pushes the cylinder plunger, dropping the silver bullet into his hand
See, dear boy
Totally unimpaired
Behind him, the ' head appears in the window, its green eye flaring

(shrieking) It's him
It's the werewolf

She's pointing at the window
He jumps up and looks around at the window- at this point has the
22 with its cylinder open in one hand and the silver bullet loosely held in the other
Nothing in the window but darkness
turns back to the kids
(sharply) You see it, Marty
(shakes his head) was looking at you
His shoulders slump a little with relief- now that the scare is over, his relief is tempered with irritation
They're just a couple of hysterical kids after all, and  is actually worse than

rolls a little closer to her and attempts to put a comforting arm around her shoulder
Don't you touch me, snotbrains
Jane- Would you kids go to bed
My head's starting to ache
, We see a clawed, hairy hand reach into the frame and close around a thick wire
(voice) Reeeal slow
It yanks
, The lights go out
It's here
It's outside
Jane, it's just a power fai- He's starting toward her
At that moment most of the wall- not just the window it was looking through before but the whole wall- crashes inward as the  bulls its way through, roaring
whirls, raising the pistol automatically to fire- but the cylinder is rolled out and all the chambers are empty
He has time to register surprise before the smashes him aside
, He goes flying backward
The pistol goes one way, the silver bullet another
It spins into a living-room corner
, We see it rise in the air, turning over and over
It comes down, hits the floor, and rolls

is a heating vent
The bullet is rolling toward it
Get the gun
He uses his hands to propel the ungainly Silver Bullet into the hall
(  )  , The silver bullet rolls slowly toward the heating vent
In the b
g
we see a frantic  in his wheelchair
He heaves himself out of it and falls full-length, grabbing
His fingers touch the bullet, but that's all
It falls in the heating vent
, It's roaring, furious, its one eye flaring
, lies senseless against one wall, the front of his shirt bloody
runs into the corner and grabs the pistol
The  picks up the easy chair and throws it through the hole it made coming in
It picks up an end table and hurls it through the
Then it sees  and starts toward her
, , Comes toward her
She makes as if to run one way
It's only a couple of feet from her now, but again, it is toying with her- it's making this reeeal slow
, bloodstained hand grabs a poker
As it tenses down to leap at her,   leaps at it and strikes it across the back
It turns,
hits it between the legs
It  and grabs the poker
It bends it and tosses it aside
The glaring, savage expression on its face says that now it will bend   and toss him aside
She breaks out of the corner and runs across the room toward the door
Most of the way there she trips and falls
, Its head whips around
, He's lying full-length
He's got the heater vent's grille off
One arm is down inside
(scream) Janey
The gun
She tosses it awkwardly
, It slides down the hall floor to  like some strange, awkward shuffleboard disc, its cylinder still open
(snarls) Maa-aaa-rty
It begins walking slowly across the living room, smashing things out of its way
, The gun slides into his hand
Now he reaches into the heating duct again
, There's an elbow bend just below ' twisting, grasping fingers- the silver bullet lies here
It's less than half an inch out of reach
, (foaming) Maaa-aaa-rty
, (sobbing) Don't you hurt him
Don't you hurt my brother
She bites one of the ' hairy ankles as it passes
It roars with pain and kicks her aside
Then it looks back into the hall
It is grinning
believe it is thinking this is going to be better than a Thanksgiving dinner you don't have to pay for
Reeeal slow, Maa-aaarty- , He's reaching desperately into the duct and staring at the approaching
, ' fingers brush the bullet once
again
seize it
, He rolls over on his back and sticks the silver bullet blindly into one chamber of the cylinder and slams the cylinder closed
, Bastard Marty
He points the gun and pulls the trigger
There's only a click
An expression of dismay on his face
, Kill you
He drags himself so he's half propped against the hall wall
He pulls the trigger again
Click
Dismay becomes fear
It's reached the Silver Bullet
It smashes it aside
The Bullet hits the wall
Holding the gun in both hands now, he pulls the trigger a third time
Click
The ' shadow falls over him

It bends down, reaching
, Craning back as if to drive himself into the wall, he pulls the trigger again
22 - The bullet flies from the barrel, gleaming silver
The silver bullet strikes him in his one remaining eye
He flies backward, hands clapped to his gushing face
and crashes into ' Silver Bullet wheelchair
It sits there, roaring
and then it begins to change
, She lies there, sobbing
(voice) You okay, Janey
is bloody and staggering but on his feet
He helps up
'm all right
but Marty
Ma- :
, Its hands drop from its face
It is now blind in both eyes; it is half  and half
It  again, convulses
and dies
, (calls) 'm all right
He's dead
Here's a creature that is mostly   collapsed in the remains of ' wheelchair; beyond it,  is lying on the floor
goes by the corpse
starts by
and  sits bolt upright for a moment, grasping blindly at her
She shrieks and darts aside
falls back, now really dead

Until the sequel
,   , , puts a comforting arm around , who is sobbing again- hell, 'd be sobbing after that last one, myself- and draws her down beside himself and
(to ) There
told you there weren't any such things as werewolves
They smile at each other with love
(nervous) Are you sure it's dead
Or him
Or whatever it is
If it isn't now, it will be after  pound one of your mother's silver candlesticks through its heart
(grimaces) Oh Uncle Al, no
(grim) Oh yes, Janey
When  believe something, believe it all the way
He gets up and leaves
Are you all right, Marty
All except my legs
don't think  can walk
You're a real booger, you know it
(smiles) love you, Jane
' , Quiet
Sleeping
(voice-over) It wasn't always easy for me to answer that
but  could answer it that night, and  find  can say it now that the terrible events of that fall have receded to memories which seem little more than dreams in my mind
, (hugging him) love you, Marty
' , (voice-over; no more than a whisper) love you, Marty
good night
to the full moon
