Suddenly, for no apparent reason, In confusion, he taps on the instrument attempting to stabilize it, but the radioactivity continues to climb
He looks up to the horizon obscured by the sand storm - still nothing in sight
He sighs
His colleague is probably right, the Geiger counter simply needs an adjustment
He turns it off when     ,  , comes out of nowhere and jumps at his face- ,
Scared to death, the scientist pushes him away and backs off
The man covered by blood falls on the ground and starts crying, begging for help
The scientist doesn't have time to - Terrified, the man covered with blood watches the scientist's dead body-fall to the ground revealing, for a quick second, : In the distance, the other scientists continue their work, oblivious to the attack

The shadowy figure continues the assault on Man 2, finishing him off
Powerless to stop'the massacre, the last scientist runs away in a panic

He doesn't have time to climb the rocks as he is pulled down, screaming in his mask

Somewhere else, prefabricated towns filled with test dummies are eradicated by atmospheric explosions

The sun begins to rise revealing- long deserted horizon stretching out endlessly
Nothing lives in this and wilderness

-  4 road curves through the desert terrain
On the side of the road, at the bottom of a hill, a gas station has survived years of wind and dust
Around the main building, a tool shed, three gas pumps, a dilapidated well, a water tower, and gutted carcasses of cars from the 1950's accentuate the desolate feeling which prevails in this place
sign reads "   200 "

5 : 5 - a metal grinding noise is heard outside

In the darkness we discover a room hardly furnished
The withered and yellowed wallpaper flaps slowly in the draft
On the dresser, dozens of empty liquor bottles

He grabs a , loading it swiftly

The door opens and the old man walks out holding his gun
Nobody
Silence has returned
The metal grinding is gone
The lever from the water well still moves
' Hidden behind the house someone or something observes the old station attendant walking slowly to the well

Worried, the old man scans the surroundings

The old man looks-around terrified
Diligently, he enters the house leaving the bag on the ground
On second thought, the door reopens and the bag is dragged inside

-  7 The shutters are all closed leaving the station in darkness
The old man throws the leather bag on the dining table and sets down the shotgun
He takes a cigar from an ashtray and lights it
He grabs a whisky bottle

7  : 7 After a solid gulp, he turns on a bare light-bulb hanging over the table, and stares at the bag in silence
One more swig for courage, and the old man empties the bag on the - Jewels, a Swiss watch, a  Cam, glasses, several cell phones, a pager, loose cash, credit cards, a wallet

He grabs the wallet and pulls out a photo already sticking out
On the bent picture, we see a young couple kissing
The young woman wears the same earrings found on the severed ear
The old man heaves a sigh before putting the wad of cash in his pocket
Outside, a voice is heard

My crazy husband absolutely had to see the desert
Nothing to see in the desert
Big Bob glares at the old man who fills up the tank while still chewing on his cigar
You know, it's illegal to smoke around a gas station
The old man bursts out in laughter revealing rotten teeth

Doug, please stop

Big Bob interrupts
Give

Sorry Bob, "duty calls"
Honey, you haven't put that phone down since we left

As the old man closes the hood, a familiar sound returns- -   - He leans over and catches Bobby and Brenda in the distance, playing with the well
Brenda is about to drink from her hands

Come on, sweetie
No answer
Cautiously, Lynn moves through the store to the beaded curtains
Above the cash register, an old sepia photograph of a miner stares at her

Lynn goes into the other room
In the darkness, among the old empty bottles, she finds Beauty standing with her front legs on a window sill and barking to the backyard
Lynn looks outside- Nobody
Only the desert and hills
Inside the room,       laying alone on the table awakens her curiosity
As she goes to inspect it, she hears the  starting and Doug calling out- (

The old man knocks on the window
Big Bob opens- ( ) Isn't it illegal to have people in a trailer while you're driving, "my friend"
He's right, Bob
'm fully aware of the driving laws
Have a safe trip
Big Bob smiles back and starts the engine
Everyone ready

18 : 18 The old man stops him- You know, it's not on the map, but if you take a right at the road a couple miles from here, it'll lead you through the hills
Probably save you three or four hours
Thanks for the tip
: The trailer drives off in the distance leaving the attendant in a cloud of dust
The old man looks to the hills, taking a deep breath

The binoculars pan across the deserted terrain before stopping on the Carter vehicle, a tiny dot at the end of the road
The car and trailer approach
Off screen, we hear   behind the binoculars

His pronunciation is poor and we cannot understand everything he says

Chevy and a trailer

-  21 We see the scenery through the window blinds
On a wall, photographs of other Carter vacations are reminders of the good times spent in the trailer home
The thermometer reads above 100 degrees
Sweating, Doug hangs on while the camper bounces over the rough road
Bobby works on the /
He has removed the face plate and tries to fix the motor with the screwdriver

Well, at least we can breathe now

Doug grabs a cigarette

( ) Does my sister know
(lighting it with a ) Fuck her
() Big Bob would kill you if he knew you were smoking in his "88 Airstream"
( ) Fuck him too
You want one
Doug extends the pack
Bobby hesitates before reaching for one, but Doug pulls the pack away at the last moment
(') Yeah right, if you start smoking your sister would cut my nuts off

It's a drag when it's just us and our parents
Hey,  like seeing your parents

(
) Dad, you shouldn't have listened to that guy
We're lost

) Look how beautiful it is here girls
The hills, the colors
It's amazing
Imagine the first people who crossed this desert

Don't drive so fast Bob, you might lose the camper

() Oh, stop it
She remembers

trap has been set: a long chain of retractable spikes have emerged across the road
few seconds later, the  drives over them at full speed
,
Big Bob loses control of the vehicle
The car rolls on the rims causing the trailer to almost flip over
Inside, Doug loses his grip and is thrown against the side of the trailer
On the road, the spikes retract, disappearing into the ground
Silence
The chain of spikes slithers away in the dust like a snake

24 : 24 The dead lizard, sliced neatly in half, bakes in the hot sun

Lynn jumps out of the car and runs to the trailer
Doug
Bobby
Are you alright
Bobby opens the door releasing the barking dogs
Don't worry, we're fine
( ) What the hell happened
Where's Catherine
She's fine
Mom has her
knew this wasn't gonna be safe for the baby
The heat must have caused a blow out
Are you all right
think so
Just a little shaken up
Bobby walks around the car evaluating the damage- The  tires are shredded - the rims buried into the ground
Holy shit
() hope they have triple  out here
() 25
25 : 25 On the other side of the trailer, Brenda has gotten out and regained her senses
She takes a few steps, taking in the land surrounding them
The lunar terrain of sand and rocks extends beyond the horizon
In the distance, only the jagged hills are cut out against the sky
Something    lives in this place
Behind the trailer, Doug walks off with his cell phone
97% nationwide coverage, and we have to find ourselves in that 3%
He searches desperately for a signal, extending his arm forward
Lynn grabs him tenderly by the waist
(') (staring to the lifeless ) Your father wanted to see the desert
Doug
hope he's enjoying himself
On his knees, by the  tires, Big Bob inspects under the vehicle
Not only are the tires flattened, but the front axel has buckled from hitting the rocks
( ) How am  supposed to drive with you talking my ear off
'm pulling a trailer on a dirt road and it's 200 degrees out here
Behind him, Ethel walks with the baby who has stopped crying
Oh, so now it's my fault
Doug joins them
So what's the damage, General
() 26
25 : (2) 25 The damn axel is broken
Can we fix it
With what
The frame is completely twisted
Give me your phone, 'm gonna call a tow truck

Can we use the /
That old thing
Give it a try, but this is mining country
Whatever metal is left in those hills will probably scramble the signal
What are we going to do
Without answering, Big Bob gets back on his feet, wipes his hands and grabs a bottle of water from the car
After a long - We're going to walk, that's what
Walk
But we're miles from - (cutting him off) So we wait here for someone to drive by
Have you seen a car in the last three hours

Beauty and Beast have stopped below a boulder extending twenty feet high
They bark and growl towards the top

If you get bit, you'll die in twenty minutes
Big Bob reaches into the glove compartment pulling out a 9mm and an extra clip
He hands it to his son
(') or was it five
Bobby grabs the firearm pointing it to the desert
Big Bob grabs another gun from the car,  44 (with a big smile) 'd like to see how they stack up against this
Ethel brings her husband's jacket and helps him put it on
Some things never change
(loading his weapon) 'll take my bullets over your prayers any day
You think we'll see scorpions and coyotes

Bob grabs his son by the shoulders, proud
They look like two kids getting ready to play Cowboys and Indians
Bobby calls out to Doug, offering the gun- (') Hey Doug, wanna try

29 : (2) 29 () Oh no
No thanks buddy
Come on, just one shot, it makes you feel kinda powerful
Big Bob answers for Doug- Leave him alone son
Doug is a liberal, he wouldn't touch a gun
Obviously, the two men disagree
Behind the trailer, Brenda sits on a lounge chair in her bra revealing a sexy body
She applies suntan lotion ready to kill some time
Behind her sunglasses, she observes the silent desert looking like Paris Hilton
Lynn exits the trailer and joins her
Catherine just fell asleep
How are you holding up
() Thrilled to be here
Yeah, this is a total drag, especially with a baby
don't care what they say, next year, 'm going to Cancun with my friends
No more "family trips" for me
We're not going to have many more trips like this together
As for Cancun, you're gonna have to find a job
'mon, with all the money your husband makes, you could at least buy me a plane ticket

29 : (3) 29 (') Don't you think
Please, for your poor little sister
Doug's voice interrupts
(
) Lynn, can you bring me my jacket honey
Lynn gets up and returns to the trailer
(imitating her sister) "Right away, honey
" Without turning around, Lynn gives her sister the finger
Brenda smiles with satisfaction
30
-  30 Lynn finds her husband's jacket and stops when she sees a cigarette butt in the sink
She's pissed
She picks it up and throws it away
catches her attention outside
She looks through the kitchen blinds and spots the quick reflection of light coming from the top of the hills when- Lynn falls back against
the kitchen table scared to death
Bobby laughs, pleased with himself
Annoyed, Lynn shuts the blinds in his face
31
-  31 Outside, Doug and Big Bob look at the road map laid out on the ground
'll keep walking north
This road's gotta lead somewhere
Lynn comes around with the jacket and sees Big Bob and Bobby both holding guns
What are you going to do with those
It's always good to be prepared
Right
() 31 : ( ) Are you taking a gun too
Big Bob answers for him
We've only got two and it's better if you guys have one here
You never know
Are you sure you're going to be alright
Lynn puts a fisherman's hat on Doug to protect him from the sun and kisses him tenderly
If you don't find any help in six or seven miles come back
'll go to the gas station
It's almost 3, you'll never be back before sunset
It's only about ten miles from here
'll borrow that crazy old man's truck and use his phone if he has one
Don't worry
'll be back with a tow truck before nightfall
Can  go with Doug
No
Stay here with your mother and sisters
( ) And you, don't tease your brother, he's in charge now
Holding the gun, Bobby winks at his sister who continues to sunbathe
Yeah, right
Ethel remains silent and worried
() 32
31 : (2) 31 We should pray before you go- Oh please
Is it really too much to ask
(turning to her husband) Bob
Bob finally agrees, and like a good family man, he gathers them around
Brenda slips on her shirt and joins them
() Thank God nobody's watching us
In a lowered voice, Ethel recites a prayer
Even though only Ethel takes it seriously, in that precise moment the arguing stops and the family seems united and strong
But seen from the surrounding summit, through Goggle's binoculars, the family looks small and vulnerable
Behind them the sun begins to descend
, 32
-  32 Catherine wakes up crying in her crib
Hey, little princess
Who doesn't want to sleep anymore
The baby looks at her mother, appeased

Lynn continues to feed Catherine
You shouldn't go from the bottle to the breast
At her age she should get used to one or the other
Mom, thanks for the advice, but she's my baby
Vexed, Ethel remains quiet
(') It's starting to get cold out here, isn't it
(trying to be nice) can't believe you're spending your anniversary stranded in the middle of nowhere

" This place isn't so bad
At least the air is fresh

34 : 34 Better than Cleveland
Anything's better than Cleveland

Please, Mom
Nothing can stop Dad when he thinks he's found a shortcut
Remember when we ran out of gas on the "shortcut" to the Great Lakes
How old was
12, 13
This family has certainly seen its share of adventures
If we had just stayed on the main road we'd already be in California
Yeah-what 'd do for a shower and a margarita
The beach
real bed
Bobby sits down at the table
Has anybody seen my grey sweatshirt
It was in the car
've looked everywhere
didn't touch your smelly sweatshirt
Beast has been pulling on his chain nonstop, while Beauty cries softly from inside the trailer

34 : (2) 34 Why are the dogs so excited
Probably some rattlesnakes not far away
() You know how Freud would've interpreted your obsession with rattlesnakes Mom
Ethel throws her kitchen towel at him
They laugh
beat, then Ethel becomes sentimental
Brenda's going off to college
And then, next year, it's Bobby's turn
The house is going to feel so empty
Lynn grabs her mother's hand- (') 'm really happy that we're all together on this trip
Brenda moves to the trailer
Beauty is still barking inside
That makes one of us
They glare at her as she opens the door

-  35 Beauty escapes to the hills
Bobby runs as fast as he can but cannot keep up
The dog gets further and further away, climbing up the side of the mountain
Beauty moves through the first series of rocks
Bobby loses sight of her and stops
Out of breath, he hesitates- Ahead, the rocky horizon shows no indication of a definite path
He spots Beauty climbing between some rocks and continues his chase
At the bottom of the hill, the rocks are too jagged for him to continue running
He slows down and begins moving past the first set of rocks
With much more agility, Beauty climbs quickly towards the top, disappearing behind some rocks
(-) Nothing
Only sharp rocks stand before him
, Bobby freezes
No doubt about it - Beauty found what she was looking for, and it was much stronger
In the distance, Bobby hears his mother calling
36
-  36 few feet from the trailer- -

Overcome with worry, she turns to her two daughters

36 : 36 (') You think he can hear me

She couldn't have gone that far
Brenda notices the revolver on the table
Bobby is unarmed
(') (back to the hills) -
37
-  37 Back on a threatening mound of rocks
Bobby must decide- Return to his family waiting by the trailer or continue his search for Beauty
Bobby hesitates, then gathers his courage and decides to confront the hills

Bobby is ready to give up when something attracts his - Someone or something is hiding behind a rock

Squeezing the stone, he lifts his hand to strike but stops when he - ,  14,
She is about five feet tall and frail
The hood covers her head, partly hiding her face
She is rather pretty, even with her
She trembles, frightened and intrigued by Bobby
What is this girl doing in a place like this

Don't be scared
won't hurt you
What are you doing here
The girl keeps silent
Bobby drops the stone to the ground but the young girl remains suspicious

The young girl smiles shyly
The ice is broken

The young girl hesitates and murmurs in a frail voice

The girl murmurs softly

He comes closer trying to make eye contact as she continues to murmur the same thing
She too is terrified- () The hills
The hills have eyes
The hills have eyes

Behind him, a small rock slide grabs his attention
He turns his head
When he turns back to Ruby, she is gone
Ruby, come back
Once more, Bobby is alone in the labyrinth
On the other side, he finds a trail of blood as if a body had been dragged on the rocks
The bloody trail is still fresh and disappears behind another set of rocks a few feet away
Bobby hesitates, unsure of what he might find
As soon as he's around the outcropping to the other side Bobby sees something that stops him dead in his tracks
Before him, on the ground, is Beauty
Dead
Disemboweled
Bobby drops to his knees, disbelieving, his face turning white
He touches the animal's head as if to convince himself that this nightmare can't be possible at all

Using his hand, Goggle devours something ferociously- '
Terrified, Bobby runs away
Goggle laughs from his rock
Bobby jumps down the hill
From the summit, Goggle continues feasting
few yards away, Ruby's slender silhouette slides between the rocks
Goggle stops eating, sees Ruby, and throws her the remains
Ruby looks at the half-eaten leg in disgust, and pushes it away

You don't like dog anymore

-  39 Moving at top speed, Bobby descends from the hills, occasionally glancing behind him
He jumps from one rock to the next
Anything to get out of this hellhole
He turns around one too many times and fails to see the sharp precipice ahead
He tries to stop, but it's too late
Bobby slides down a few feet before grabbing hold of a protruding rock
The rock tears his skin

The cars all seem to be in good condition, as if they were simply pushed into the crater
He leans down towards another car- Barbed wire is rolled around the flattened tires
As Doug looks around in confusion, trying to figure out what this place might be, - revealing five or six others craters

Wind blows around the dark gas station

By placing his hand on the spout, Big Bob stops the whistling and silence returns

Big Bob walks to the porch
No answer
He knocks on the door

faint light comes from the back room
The wind blows dust through the broken windows
Vigilantly, he moves through the empty shelves, behind the counter and past the beaded curtain separating the two rooms
The light bulb above the dining table is on
Somebody home
Hello
Big Bob pushes the last door leading to the back room
His hand feels for the light switch
- an old lamp comes on in the corner
He finds a wall mounted phone and picks up the receiver
No tone

Through the window, Big Bob sees a pick-up truck
He starts searching for the keys
Going through the different rooms, he discovers a drawer full of money, jewels, watches, credit cards
He spots a key chain hanging from a nail next to the desk
He reaches for the keys when something else grabs his attention- Partially hidden in the dark, he discovers a few family photos and a few newspaper clippings from the 1950s pinned to the wallpaper
Big Bob lights the desk lamp and turns it towards the wall- His face goes cold- On the aged photos, we recognize the old gas station attendant in his younger days, next to his wife and his - () 46

On a more recent polaroid, we can recognize Ruby at 6 years old
Besides her three fingers and big eyes, half of her skull is missing or caved in
Another polaroid - in a wheelchair, a little boy has difficulty holding up his hugely disproportionate head
The headline from the clippings makes Big Bob understand the origins of these horrors- "New Mexico- Nuclear enters a new age
" "
Miner town evacuated" "Miners refuse to abandon their lands by hiding in " "Military destroys miner's town
" The old man's family was
one of those families whose genetic lineage was forever changed by the nuclear fallout
Big Bob is shocked, never believing such a thing was possible

Worried for his own family, he grabs the keys and walks out
From the bedroom window, we see him running to the pick-up truck

Beast strains on his chain, a low growl of rage coming from his chest

Even with a blanket around his shoulders, Bobby shivers
Ethel soaks cotton in alcohol using it to clean his wounds
You're lucky Brenda found you

Bobby winces from the pain
Don't worry, Beauty will come back when she's hungry

Some sort of breathing
Bobby lifts his head

Mom, it sounded like a perverted crank call

His mother and two sisters are surprised by his agitated behavior

Behind him, Brenda sets the baby in her crib and starts a hanging above, setting off the music and rocking the baby to sleep
She disappears in the bathroom for a moment and comes out in t-shirt and panties
She turns to her brother- Can  listen to your iPod
Bobby is still focused on the door

Can  borrow your iPod

Brenda grabs it and cranks the volume

Pluto laughs stupidly, excited by the situation
His large smile reveals  -
Once the gas can is full, he waves at somebody hidden in the dark

This disturbed mind takes pleasure in dressing up in "Mama's clothes"
Then, famished, he eats everything he can find in the trailer
Raw meat, fruit, potato chips
He washes it all down with milk, orange juice
His eyes stop on the bird cage
He smiles
Lizard moves closer, opens the cage and grabs one of the parrakeets
The small bird looks around in confusion
Blood drips on his chin
Brenda's muted screams attract his attention
Lizard walks across the trailer
He pushes Pluto violently to the ground
Move
(with a smile) You gotta be a man to do that
Pluto is outraged and tries to stand up
He wants to talk but no words come out
Lizard savagely hits him several times
Behind them, terrified, Brenda watches helplessly as they fight
Lizard puts his foot on Pluto's face, pinning him to the ground, and then points the gun to his head

Ethel finally realizes it's too late for her husband and collapses into her daughter's arms
Just then, a muffled scream from Brenda pierces the night
Oh my god
Lynn runs inside leaving her mother alone

The gun stays pointed at the baby as- Lizard removes Ethel's sun hat and hovers over Lynn's breast
Seen from behind her shoulder, we can't figure out exactly what this mental case is doing
Is he nursing from her breast
Lynn trembles, but can only think of her baby and her sister, who are still threatened
Excited by what his brother is doing, Pluto fondles Brenda
Suddenly, Ethel jumps into the trailer with a broom and starts batting away at Lizard
For once, her adrenaline kicks in as she fights for the most important thing in her life - Her family
The broom has little effect and is almost comical

-  78 In the trailer home, Brenda takes advantage of the confusion to get away from Pluto and grabs the Phillips screwdriver from beneath the sleeper
Brenda slides the screwdriver to Lynn who raises it and is about to strike when- - Lynn is shot in the chest
Lizard turns to Brenda and aims at her head
He is about to shoot when Lynn, with her last breath- Lizard screams in pain and turns the gun back to Lynn- - He blows off part of her skull
Blood splatters throughout the cabin
79
-  79 Alarmed by the gunfire, Doug gets up and looks at the trailer in the distance
He doesn't know what to do
Bobby appears behind him- Come on Doug
They're in the trailer-
They both take off running
80
-  80 Witness to the slaughter, Brenda is petrified with fear
Lizard pulls out the screwdriver and stands with difficulty
He picks up the baby and hands it to Pluto
Take it
Pluto obeys
Lizard grabs Brenda by the hair and pulls her out of the trailer
() 69
80 : 80 (') Come on bitch
She screams and resists by grabbing at furniture and pulling off the curtains
Her nails scratch against the paneling

-  81 Brenda is pulled out by Lizard
When he sees Bobby and Doug approaching, Lizard changes his - '
Brenda is wide eyed
Without hesitating, Lizard pulls the - - no more bullets
Lizard drops Brenda
'll come back for ya
Lizard disappears into the night
Brenda lays on the ground trembling and crying
Doug arrives at the trailer, while Bobby aims the 9mm at the assassins
It's too late
They're gone
Bobby runs to his traumatized sister laying on the ground
He holds her in his arms, trying to calm her down
Doug approaches the open door
He notices bloody hand prints along the side of the trailer home- One of the attackers has been hurt
82
-  82 Doug enters the trailer unable to imagine the tragedy
() 70
82 : 82 Horrified, he discovers Ethel on the couch, not quite dead, but short of breath and in pain
Doug is stone faced- , ' ,   ,
His eyes fill with tears
He tries to keep from crying but his sadness is too deep
His hand approaches her face
His fingers graze her hair
, '      , Doug tries to breathe life back into her body, but death has overtaken her open eyes
He closes them and starts weeping
The music from the Fisher Price mobile is the only other sound
Doug turns around
() No
No
He squeezes his fist with rage
83
-  83 At the foot of the burnt tree, Big Bob's body is laid out on some rocks, the blanket over his face
few figures emerge out of the darkness and gather around the body like a pack of hyenas
: 84
-  84 Backlit by the moon, at the top of the hill, we find Goggle and his binoculars
Reflecting in the lenses, we see the carters' trailer glowing in the night
rustling noise attracts his attention
() 71
84 : 84 Before Goggle can turn around, a wild animal jumps at his face- '
The German shepherd tears at Goggle's face and locks deep into his throat
Goggle tries to fight it off, but the animal is determined to kill
Goggle grabs    out of his pocket and tries to cut the animal
The dog bites down tightening its grip
He drops the razor
Goggle's derby hat falls between some rocks
Someone calls him on the on walkie-talkie- (
) "Goggle
Goggle
" Goggle will not answer anymore
85
-  85 Laid out on the couch, Ethel agonizes between life and death
Brenda stares into space, saying nothing
Doug touches her head as he passes
Instinctively, she backs off terrified
Across the trailer, Bobby paces back and forth
() What are we going to do Doug
What are we going to do if they come back
Completely defeated, Doug comes back and goes to Ethel's side
(') Doug
Doug does not answer and takes Ethel's hand
She opens her eyes and looks at him as if nothing happened
This camper's so small
No matter how much you clean, it's always a mess
() 72
85 : 85 Doug nods in silence
(') Is Big Bob home
Not yet
Did everyone go to bed
Yes, Brenda is here and Bobby is in the kitchen
At the other end, Bobby turns away, crying
Brenda looks away as well
(short of breath) Is Lynn sleeping
Doug holds back the tears
Yes
(after a beat) Do you need anything
Ethel finds it more and more difficult to talk
Look in the closet Doug, 'm sure have another blanket
'm so cold
Doug tucks one of the blankets around her
() There's one here
Nice and warm
You've always been so sweet understand why Lynn loves you so much
She raises her arm to caress his face
Her hand falls on the bed
Lifeless
Brenda screams, bursting into tears
() 73
85 : (2) 85 At the same time Bobby pounds his fist against a wall
His eyes full of hate, he joins Doug
() Come on
'm not going to take this shit
Doug gets mad as well
'
' ,
Fine
You stay here
'm going after them
Doug gets between Bobby and the door, preventing the kid from leaving
(') Let me go
You want to die, too
don't care
Doug drags him in front of his mother's body
Look
Look at what they did to your mother
Look at what they did to your sister
He slams Bobby against the door
(') You're not a fucking child, alright
Think before you do something stupid
You won't make it three feet
We need a plan,
We need to think
Think about what
They have Catherine, Doug
Doug remains silent
() 74
85 : ( 3) 85 (') You know what they could to do to her, and you're not going to stop them
You're just a coward
Doug jumps back on Bobby grabbing him by the collar
() They all freeze
Doug releases Bobby and immediately turns off the light
Plunged in darkness, Brenda panics again- No
No
don't turn it off
() He swore he'd come back to get me
He swore it
Don't let him take me, Bobby
Outside, another noise, (') () '
' '
' Bobby picks up the gun- - With no hesitation, he shoots through the door
Brenda throws herself into Doug's arms
Bobby stares at the bullet holes in the trailer door
Suddenly, the sound of a radio is heard- (
) "Goggle, you copy
Goggle
" Bobby and Doug look at each other confused
() 75
/I12 85 : (4) 85 (
) (') "Goggle
" Doug silently moves closer to the door
From outside we can see Doug's eye through one of the bullet holes
Nobody, everything seems quiet
Get ready Bobby
Doug opens the door and jumps out ready to fight
From beneath the trailer, someone observes him
Doug bends down and discovers- '
In its hand, the walkie-talkie still works
(
) "Goggle
Goggle
" Doug grabs the radio
It's dripping with blood
Bobby is about to join him when Doug signals- '
Without a sound, Bobby aims the gun at the kitchen floor
Outside, Doug backs up to see who is hiding
Behind the step ladder, he sees an inert shape in the shadows
- Bobby shoots through the floor
Immediately, the shadowy figure jumps out into the light- Beast
The dog jumps into Doug's arms and begins licking his face
Bobby can't believe it, his dog has returned
Radio static comes back on the walkie
Bobby picks it up- (
) "Papa Jupe
Goggle is dead found him in the rocks
" "Dead
" () () 76
85 : (5) 85 (
) (') "They got him
He's all torn up
" Bobby is proud of Beast
Still in the trailer, Brenda looks at them, not as hopeful
Good boy
That's a good dog
/ (
) "'m gonna take care of those bastards myself"
Bobby exchanges a worried glance with Doug
Even though neither of the two has yet met Papa Jupe, something in his voice tells them that it's only going to get worse
Doug grabs the radio- (in the radio) No answer
Just static
(') ( ) Give me back my little girl
Give her back to me
More static
(') Silence
Suddenly we hear- '
Doug drops the radio, scared speechless
(') How much ammo do you have left
don't know, half a clip
: 77
86
-  86 On a dimly lit wooden table, Catherine lays, wrapped in a blanket
butcher's knife is planted next to her
Asthmatic breathing, and the sound of running water punctuate the silence
Ruby steps out of the darkness and moves towards the baby
She watches through her abnormally large eyes and extends her stringy fingers to touch the baby
large screen splits the room in two
strangely shaped shadow moves behind the screen: washed by
An empty wheel chair rests in a corner
Amused, Ruby looks at the baby who smiles back
She carefully takes Catherine in her arms when the invalid's voice - (
) Put that down Ruby
You know better than to play with your food
Ruby takes a step back, hugging the baby tighter
- Mama, pleaaase
(
) (weak asthmatic voice) Listen to your mother Ruby and put that baby down
Now
Frightened, Ruby obeys and quickly runs out of the room
The baby starts crying
: 87
-  87 Brenda sits by the / and retries the  calls
() 78
87 : 87 Mayday
Mayday
We need help Mayday
Mayday
can anybody hear me
Something has gone off in her eyes
She is absent, no longer living, just surviving
Doug is about to leave, taking with him anything from the trailer which might be useful
, ,
Let me go with you
No, you stay here with your sister and stay by the radio
Somebody's bound to hear us
Brenda continues her distress call
Mayday
mayday
Can anybody hear me
( ) The sun'll be up soon
One of them is hurt, 'm going to follow his trail through the hills
Bobby pulls out the 9mm gun and hands it to him
(') No
You keep it in case they come back
What about you
Don't worry about me, 'll take Beast
Beast sits at his feet ready to go
Doug straps the walkie- talkie over his shoulder
Doug
() 79
87 : (2) 87 Yes
didn't mean what  said
Doug hugs him like a brother
Before walking out, he bends down to Lynn's body and kisses her one last time on the mouth
'm going to find
our baby my love
promise
: 88
-  88 The first sign of dawn lights the distant horizon
The vultures perched on a dead Joshua Tree swivel their heads around, to see a distant, running  - , moving steadily among the rocks
89
-  89 Doug and Beast arrive at the old mine's entrance on the side of the hill
The trail of blood leads inside
Doug hides behind a rock
Sweating, he catches his breath
Beast breathes heavily as well
Doug remembers what his wife always used to say- (to the dog) told you to stop smoking
Doug sets a different frequency on his radio- (') (Into the walkie) Bobby
Bobby
You read me
(
) Yeah, Doug
followed the blood, 'm in front of a mine
() () 80
89 : 89 (') 'm not sure if 'll get a signal from inside
If you don't hear from me in a half an hour, you're on your own
( ) Bobby
Yeah
Good luck, Doug
He puts the walkie away and takes out the flashlight
( ) You ready big guy
hope you're not afraid of the dark
He pets the dog one final time and stands up
90
-  90 With the light from the entrance behind him, shadow enters the mine
The beam from his flashlight follows the trail of blood on the ground
The wooden pylons which have held up the walls for a hundred years threaten to crumble at any second
Only static on the radio
Doug turns it off
He moves further into the darkness, probing with his flashlight into the inky pit
Doug arrives at a fork splitting the tunnel off in two different directions
Doug lights each tunnel with the flashlight until he finds the one with-the blood trail, then continues on into that one
Tracking
Suddenly he stops
The beam of the flashlight has revealed that have been planted in the ground over mounds
That look very much like graves
The pickaxes look eerily like crosses, given the whole place the feel of
Hanging from the graves, dates and portraits of all the miners who have died here, including women and children
The flashlight dims
Doug taps it to no avail
() 81
90 : 90 Come on
You can't be serious
Then light goes
completely off, leaving Doug in darkness
Scratch
- He lights a match
Holding the tiny flame, Doug continues down the tunnel until he arrives at another fork
He can no longer see the blood trail
(') (to Beast, meaning ) Just stay calm, boy
gust of air kills the match
He immediately lights another- Again,
He turns around, looking for the source of the air, and notices a reflection of light at the end of the tunnel
He moves towards the reflection
91
-  91 On the other side of the hill, the collapsed wooden beams and stones block part of the mine's exit
Doug emerges with Beast
His eyes takes a moment to adapt to the bright sunlight
He
cannot believe what he sees
At the bottom of a hill, -   - 50'
Doug turns the walkie on
() Bobby, Bobby, it's Doug can't believe it
found a street and some houses
Maybe somebody does live here
The radio remains silent
() 82
91 : 91 (') Bobby, do you hear me
Bobby
Still nothing
Doug turns around and looks up- wall of rock towers behind him
He tries one last time, but the signal won't go through
92
-  92 Close up on the / radio in the trailer- Only static comes from the speakers
93
-  93 Brenda drags one of the tires from the  30 feet away
She douses it with lighter fluid and- Whoosh
- a match sets it on fire creating a thick, black, smoke signal
Brenda joins her brother who is busy planting wooden stakes in a circle fifty meters around the trailer
Maybe somebody heard our calls
Nobody's going to find us Brenda, even with that smoke
Nobody's coming
_
You heard what Doug said-We're alone now, just you and me
Let them come, 'm waiting for them
Now, Bobby stretches the nylon wire from the fishing pole around each stake
He sets the fishing pole next to the trailer, rigging to it one of Catherine's  - An improvised alarm system
94
-  94 At the summit, somebody observes the trailer and the thick cloud of smoke rising to the air
: 83
95
-  95 Doug runs down the hills towards the town
Behind him, from the mouth of the mine, someone observes between the rocks- it's Ruby
Doug slows his pace as he enters Main Street
The town is deserted
No sign of life anywhere
All the houses and cars are covered with a thick layer of dust
Taking a closer look, he realizes all the parked cars are from the 50's
Uncertain, Doug walks through the ghost town, with Beast at his side
No movement besides the wind blowing and lifting an occasional cloud of dust
Doug walks up to a house and knocks on the front door
No one to open the door
Doug wipes one of the windows- It's too dark inside to see anything
The door is unlocked, Doug pushes it
It squeaks open
He hesitates before entering
96
-  96 Sunlight passes through the dusty windows revealing a living/dining room decorated from the 50's
Doug can't believe his eyes- Through the kitchen door, he can see a woman doing dishes
man sits in the living room reading a newspaper
Children play in front of the blank  set
They have been dressed and placed into real life situations
Doug spots a telephone behind the staircase and checks for a dial tone
Nothing
He picks up the phone casing
, '
84
97
-  97 Doug quickly crosses Main Street to visit another house
98
-  98 New interior- New surreal setting
Around a table, a family of test dummies eat dinner
99
-  99 Stupefied, Doug enters yet another house
The door remains open as we see another family of dummies living a perfect little life 50'
Around the corner of a house, a little girl dummy is sitting on a swing, her face half broken
second later, Doug thinks he hears
He - Nothing but the wind blowing through the houses
Doug takes Catherine's bib from his pocket and lets Beast get its scent
Find her, Beast, find Catherine
With his nose to the ground, the dog pulls Doug straight ahead
Doug walks away through the streets, pulled by the dog
On the outskirts of town, we discover a fence buried in the sand
On it, an old metallic sign reads- 3B -   - The scent leads Doug into an alley off the main street
He sees an old generator on full throttle
thick smoke pours from the exhaust
His daughter could be there
() 85
99 : 99 Doug tries to see into the windows, but they are caked in filth
He decides to go around when- Immediately, Doug backs away
The man drags a cadaver by its feet
Half of the dead body is missing, having apparently been torn off
Beast
The man turns around, revealing his horrible face- is screwed on four sides of his head helping him stand straight Let's call him ""
Cyst traces back his steps, trying to find what caused the noise
He holds the gas station attendant's shotgun
The alley is empty
The generators are still motoring
All seems normal
Cyst turns back towards main street
Cyst passes an old'parked car without seeing Doug and the dog hidden inside
Doug breathes a sigh of relief
Close call
Quietly, Doug gets out of the car
He hesitates as to whether he should bring Beast with him or to leave him in the car
The dog could be his best weapon but, on the other hand, he also represents a_bigger risk to be spotted
(') () You wait here Beast
Come on, sit
Good boy
'm gonna find Catherine
The dog is confused and whines through the half-opened window
(') Shhhh
Quiet Beast
Don't move
'll be back
He closes the car door and starts down the alley, lowering his head
() 86
99 : (2) 99 From inside the car, Beast watches Doug getting further away
Doug sneaks along the side of the building towards the front door
He hesitates, unsure of what awaits him inside- 102
-  102 Doug crosses a doorway without making a sound
He enters the front hall squeezing the bat in his hands
Something in the air,   , catches his attention
Doug moves slowly and discovers, in the dining room, sitting amongst the dummies- '
His father-in-law's arms have been torn off and devoured that used to adorn his  is planted Doug approaches terrified
- (
) "Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light, What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming
" Doug jumps and quickly lifts the baseball bat, ready to swing
Nobody
Just the fake living room filled with inert dummies
No trace of his baby
An electrical fan turns in a corner, close to a shelve full of old books
Doug moves forward, gripping the bat tightly
(
) (') (feeble and asthmatic) "
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight
" He can hear his own heart beat as he searches through the house
In another room, close to the window and in the shadows, he sees someone sitting in a wheelchair
() 87
102 : 102 (
) (') "
And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air
" Doug gets closer- ray of light shines on the skull of whoever sits in the wheel chair
The wheel chair moves forward revealing a most horrific sight- - We recognize the handicapped man whom we have seen before, bathing behind the screen
Big Brain's body is skeletal
He was born with a genetic disease giving him a head ten times bigger than his face
head so heavy, he is unable to hold it up
It rests back on his chair, forcing him to stretch his eyes to see from side to side
Big Brain is maybe the most representative character of the damage done by nuclear fallout in this area
Doug threatens him with the baseball bat- Where's my baby
Where's Catherine
Big Brain does not answer
(') What did you do with her
() Nothing
Doug is beyond his breaking point - Where is she then
He raises the bat
(weak and asthmatic) don't know where she is never leave this place
Big Brain moves away from the window wheeling himself to the couch
His hands are thin and pale, like a child's
() 88
102 : (2) 102 (') You should've read the signs before taking that road
What signs
() Boom
Boom
Boom What the hell are you saying
(weak and asthmatic) You people settled on our lands, you destroyed our homes, destroyed our silver mines
You 'ye made us what we've become
One day my father went into town begging for your help, and you know what the doctors did
They sterilized him like a dog
You thought that in the desert no one would see anything, or say anything, but the hills
The hills never forget
B000M
don't know what you're talking about
All  want is my daughter
Please
Big Brain remains silent
(') What do you want
Money
can give you money
Maybe a trailer
Yeah, a pretty trailer, just like yours
Where are the others
Where is my baby
Big brain starts laughing a high pitched sound
() 89
102 : ( 3) 102 (') What
What's so funny
'
At the same moment- - ,    , Like a wild animal, Pluto charges Doug, destroying everything in his path
Doug retreats in the living room, throwing the dummies at his assailant
The giant comes closer and closer
Dummies are chopped into pieces
Doug dodges away and tries to escape, using the stairs in the hallway but the giant grabs him by the feet and pulls him down
The axe swings through the air missing him by a hair each time
103
1950  -  103 Sensing his master is in trouble, Beast jumps around inside the car trying to find an exit
The passenger window opening is too small for him to break out
104
-  104 Doug runs into another room, escaping from Pluto and his axe
Instinctively, he uses the first piece of furniture he can find,  , to block the door behind him
He looks desperately for an exit
No way out
The axe penetrates through the door
The chest won't be enough to hold back Pluto
Second axe blow- This time the axe tears up the boards of the door, allowing Pluto to stick his gruesome face inside
Seeing Doug trapped in the room, the bald giant begins to laugh stupidly before turning around and walking away
() 90
104 : 104 The house is now silent
No sign of the giant
With his heart pounding through his chest and the baseball bat in hand, Doug moves towards the half-broken door,
-     , Doug loses his bat but slides away before the axe comes swinging down
Desperate, he picks up the bat and uses it as a shield
The axe splits it in half
Doug throws himself at Pluto plunging the splintered bat into his abdomen
The sharp piece of wood enters Pluto's stomach
Completely out of his mind, Pluto removes the piece of wood from his abdomen and beats Doug in the face with it, sending him across the room
Pluto lowers his head, charging Doug like a bull
Doug crashes into one of the walls
He can't even take a breath before the giant grabs him by the leg like a rag doll and throws him through a wall
Doug falls to the ground in the living room
Wounded and exhausted, he is also defenseless
He has lost his glasses
Not far away, Big Brain savors the spectacle
The giant walks to him spinning the axe in his hand like a baton
His foot crushes Doug's glasses on the floor
The axe swings through the air
Doug jumps out of the way
- ,
Doug stares wide eyed at his amputated fingers and screams with pain
Blood is everywhere
In an act of self preservation, Doug crawls under the table
() 91
104 : (2) 104 Pluto destroys it with the axe and advances to finish him off
His asymmetrical eyes stare coldly- Doug is at his mercy
Pluto slowly caresses the axe's blade on his victims throat and face
The sharp blade moves dangerously across Doug's skin
Pluto stops when he sees Doug holding his
Pluto laughs like a dumb child at the feeble weapon
Behind him, Big Brain joins in on the laughter- Disfigured by his wounds, Doug is frozen with the screwdriver pointed at the giant
He looks ridiculous and starts sobbing like a terrorized child
Please, 'm begging you
Don't kill me
(making fun of him) Loook at-t hiiis fa-ace
Loook at- at hiiis fa-ace
Even the frozen faces of the test dummies seem to mock him
- Doug stops crying_instantly, it was a trick
He turns the screwdriver around and slams it into Pluto's foot
The screwdriver goes through the shoe nailing Pluto to the floor
Pluto screams in pain
Doug rises and moves behind him
In a swift movement, Doug takes the American flag from Big Bob's forehead, stabbing Pluto in the back of the neck
'
Pluto screams again, dropping the axe
Outraged, Pluto tears the flag from his neck and turns to Doug
() 92
104 : (3) 104 - The blade swings through the air and slams into Pluto's skull
Pluto's eyes freeze and his body falls to the ground, his skull half open
, Big Brain watches Pluto die without showing any emotion
Silence returns to the destroyed house
Doug tears off a piece of Pluto's shirt and uses it as a for his hand
He picks up his half broken shattered glasses on the floor and put them back
- Doug removes the bloody axe from the corpse
He turns to Big Brain, who backs off- The baby
the baby is in the last house on the left
: 105
-  105 The back door to the  opens, revealing Bobby and Brenda carrying Lynn's body inside where Ethel's body has been moved
Not far from the car and above the fishing pole, Catherine's shaker remains still and silent
106
-  106 Still imprisoned in the car, Beast barks, desperate to find a way out
hundred yards away- Cyst crosses Main Street toward Big Brain's house still holding the shotgun
Through the broken door, Cyst spots Pluto in a pool of blood
Hatred fills his eyes as he loads the shotgun and prepares to shoot
() 93
106 : 106 He looks for Doug but sees no one
Cyst moves in between a few cars, failing to see Doug hiding behind one of them
Doug hits the man in his knee with the axe
Cyst screams in agony
In one swift move, Doug removes the axe from Cyst's kneecap swinging it into his back
Cyst falls on the ground
The fall pushes the axe further into his back
Cyst reaches for the shotgun lost in his fall
Doug steps on his chest and pushes slowly- Crack - The axe finally hits the spine, killing him instantly
Doug picks up the shotgun
107
-  107 From the broken window, Big Brain watches Doug walk away down Main Street
He picks up a walkie-talkie hidden in his - Lizard
Kill the baby

'  -  108 Lizard enters the house holding a
The wound Lynn had given him before she died still bleeds through his improvised bandage
He moves to the kitchen with a limp
There, he comes face to face with Ruby
Behind her, the baby is wrapped inside a blanket on the table
The kitchen walls are covered with dry blood
Severed human remains are scattered about and hanging like slabs of meat
Ruby blocks his way- Get out of the way Ruby

Lizard lifts the machete threatening his little sister

Lizard approaches the baby, who moves inside the blanket

He looks for his baby in every part of the house
Nothing but dummies
Doug enters a room and sees a crib
Catherine
He goes to the crib and discovers a plastic doll
() You want to play with us mister
Doug turns around and sees two children playing in the shadows
They smile at him kindly- Doug backs away terrified

Catherine is calm and moves slowly under the blanket

-  122 Behind the trailer, Brenda helps her brother squeeze out of the back window
They both run and hide behind a rock

They did it
: 127
-  127 With Catherine held tightly in her arms, Ruby runs on the edge of the mountain
Seventy yards behind, Lizard gives chase with a limp and the chain of spikes in tow
Ruby
Ruby
You come back here right now
You hear me, you little bitch
The road on the edge comes to a dead end
Ruby is stuck, the only way out is to climb
Without using her hands, she attempts to ascend
It's close to impossible
,
She tries to fight him off, but he is too strong
Ruby kicks him in the jaw enraging him more
He pulls her down swiftly when- The animal shows his teeth, advancing towards Lizard who backs off
() 100
127 : 127 Lizard is amused and almost excited with this last confrontation
Discreetly, he grabs the chain of spikes while keeping his eyes on the barking German Shepherd
,
Beast sees the weapon and leaps towards Lizard
Too late
The chain strikes the dog in the air, sending him over the edge
Ruby refuses to hand over the baby, holding it tightly to her chest
(') Give me that baby, Ruby
With no time to react, Lizard is brutally struck in the face with the shotgun butt- Taking no chances and screaming like a wild beast, Doug beats Lizard repeatedly pushing him away from the baby
With a bloodied face, Lizard can hardly stand
Doug turns the weapon around and- - He shoots Lizard in the chest
Lizard is thrown back with the force
Doug reloads still screaming- Lizard is hit in the throat and falls
to his knees
Blood sprays everywhere
Doug reloads again- - hit in the shoulder, Lizard falls back in the dirt
His face slams into the dust
Exhausted, Doug walks over to his adversary
He is dead
Disfigured with wounds, Doug turns to Ruby, who extends the baby
() 127 : (2) Doug can barely comprehend it - the nightmare is finally over
He
drops the smoking gun and opens his arms to embrace his baby
He cries tears of joy as he holds Catherine close to him
My baby
My little princess
It's me, it's daddy
He kisses the baby and hugs her tightly, elated
Ruby is moved
She smiles when suddenly her face freezes- ,
Trembling, he lifts the weapon towards Doug and the baby
Instinctively, Ruby moves to stop him
-
- Lizard reloads
His finger squeezes the trigger
At the last second, Ruby jumps on Lizard changing the direction of the blast
They both fall off the mountain into the emptiness
Their bodies plunge a hundred feet down, splattering on the rocks below
130
-  130 One of the   of the carters posing with their dogs is slowly burning away in the flames
Pieces of the trailer still burn in the middle of the desert
Surrounded by debris, Papa Jupiter's body is impaled
on a darkened metal siding
Still alive but entirely burnt, his skin is raw and unrecognizable
With every breath, blood spits from his mouth
Facing this post atomic creature, Bobby hesitates to take it out of its misery
Brenda comes to his side- () 102
130 : 130 Come on, Bobby
Let's get out of here
Bobby's face has changed
He is no longer the innocent kid of just a few hours ago
His eyes are now filled with rage and a determination to survive and succeed no matter what
Brenda and Bobby walk away from the burning trailer
On the other side of the smoke, they see- ,
Exhausted, wounded, disfigured, but still alive
131
-  131 From a distance, next to the fiery trailer, we see Doug, Brenda, and Bobby gathered around the baby
Reunited again
