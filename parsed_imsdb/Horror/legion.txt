' When  was a little girl, my mother would remind me each night before bed to be sure to open my heart to God, for he was kind, merciful and just
Things changed after my father left a few years later, leaving her to raise me and my brothers alone in a little place out on the edge of the Mojave Desert
She never talked about a kind and merciful God again
Instead she spoke of a prophecy
Of a time when all the world would be covered in darkness and the fate of Mankind would be decided
One night  finally got up the courage to ask my mother why God had changed, why was he mad at his children
" don't know," she said, tucking the covers around me, " guess he just got tired of all the bullshit
" And with these words the last trace of sunlight is , leaving us in: darkness filled with the sounds of , ,

Might just be the smog that's making it that ominous color
Then we notice something moving in the reflection
dark shape, growing, coming down at us fast
Beat

land hard in the water
and we're in: 2
- in a tattered trench coat tumbles onto the pavement, hands out to slow the impact
beat then slowly he climbs to his feet, recovering from what seems to have been quite a fall
He has chiseled features, shaved head, deep-set eyes
Looks like he's been through one hell of a fight
His name, we will come to know, is
He quickly checks out his surroundings, nothing but brick walls above him
Where'd this guy jump from
of thunder
then  starts to hammer down
Seems to motivate him
Michael pulls his overcoat tight around his body and dashes toward the mouth of the alley
He reaches the  just in time to see a     tearing around the corner, , heading this way
He reels back into the alley way, ducks down behind a trash dumpster, as the     of the   whip past
Michael waits for the lights to disappear, then he pulls a from his jacket
Considers it grimly
Runs his finger along its edge
Blood beads up
Razor sharp
Michael begins to peel off his overcoat, revealing his bare chest underneath
and skin literally covered with Hard to see what they are in this light
As his coat falls to the ground, we  over to the behind him where we see '  crouch over, and then
, The   harder, as if punishment from the heavens
The glint of the  coming down fast
' And then
,      , , 3
- Michael, face tight with pain, trench coat back on, steps out of the alley, stares with determination at a dark storefront across the street
" &  " &   - Cavernous
Costco for survivalists
Quiet except for the sound of , then
Michael drops down through one of the skylights in a shower of glass
&   -  - Michael bursts in
Tosses a first-aid kit into the sink
His trench coat falls to the floor and here in the fluorescent light, we get a better look at him
His thin but stunningly well muscled body is shoulder to ankle with
The man's flesh is a living book
But the writing is in no language we recognize
He turns his back to the mirror, revealing two running down between both shoulder blades
He threads a needle not with thread, but with  , and begins to  the wounds closed
on the cement floor around his feet
&   - Trench coat and a shirt back on, Michael races along the , searching for just the right weapons, his every movement precise, as if he's trained his whole life for this
Weapon after ferocious weapon gets tossed into rifle bags
Whatever this guy's preparing for, it's big
Rifle bags filled, Michael heads for the exit
Stops cold
The place is locked up tight
Metal gate over the front doors, bars over the windows
How the hell's he going to get out of here

-  - Two , world weary, cruise through downtown
That's behind the wheel,  riding shotgun
The   is
Busy night
Burton stares out at the city's rain soaked denizens with a deep hatred, the shadows looming in doorways, the streetwalkers
Goddamn' animals
Nights like this wish  could take a match to this city just so  could watch all these motherfuckers burn
() good ol' boy barbecue, huh
Burton doesn't even smile
He's dead fucking serious
fresh start
That's what this place needs
He holds his finger up like a pistol
Aims it at the people they pass, picking them off one by one
Pow
Pow
Pow
Now Burton laughs, a dark, mean laugh
Estevez eyes his partner, wary
Jesus
You know Burton, 'm so happy we get to share beautiful moments like this
They really brighten my da-- Through the , we see a storefront just ahead, raining fiery debris onto the squad car
Burton slams on the breaks and the cops look up just in time to see
&   - Michael, bulging rifle bags in each hand, stepping brazenly out of the   he's blown in the front of the store
5
(
) Freeze
Estevez and Burton are already out of the squad car, crouching behind the open doors,  trained on Michael
Drop the bags
Hands on your head
In the distance, the - of
The with
"Shots fired
Code Three
Officer down
" The cops shift about nervously, trying to stay focused
(sensing their unease:) It's starting
There isn't much time
The cops shoot a quick, anxious glance at each other -- "what the hell
" -- then they turn back to Michael
Shut the fuck up and drop the bags now
Michael lets the gun bags hit the ground
Hands on your head
On your head
Michael slowly places his palms on his skull
Turn around
Turn the fuck around
Michael slowly turns around
Calm
Estevez rushes in to restrain Michael, grabbing his wrist, Michael closes his eyes, a terrible decision made
And that's when he moves, a fucking blur
In an instant Michael's broken the cop's arm, spinning him helplessly around, turning him into a human shield
Now it's Michael who's in charge, gun to Estevez's head, facing off with Burton
Burton struggles to find a shot, can't
Let `em go
6
Take the shot, Burton
said let `em fuckin' g-g-g-g-- Suddenly Burton starts to , the words stuck in his throat like a skipping record
Burton
, adding to the confusion
Burton squeezes his eyes shut in pain, his , heels  the pavement, as if some massive pressure were building inside him
And with the horrific sound of  , ' His eyes  , focused, the force inside him now fully in control
Burton looks at Michael with calm recognition, his voice man possessed
What are you doing, Michael
These weren't your orders
Estevez looks at his partner with confusion
What did you say
Michael, however, seems to know exactly who he's talking to
'm following my own orders now
Then you will die along with the child
Burton, you fuckin' know this guy
Burton shoots his partner in the head
Estevez drops, leaving Michael without cover
Burton re-aims, but Michael's faster, already  back
Bullets rip up the concrete
The squad car window , Burton's chest
7
And down he , leaving Michael the only one left standing
Smoke rising from his gun
With soldier-like efficiency, Michael picks up the rifle bags and begins to load them into the trunk of the squad car
He gets in the car and  ,  , as the , a wave chasing him,
: ( ) Bolts awake
Breathing hard
Covered with sweat
'  - Jeep switches on a lamp, illuminating this incredibly cramped bedroom
Not much larger than the bed itself
He's got shaggy hair, a sensitive face, clearly not big on sunlight
- - couple of ancient   are bathed in the eerie blue light of night's final moments
It looks like the trailers haven't moved from this patch of barren ground in decades
single strand of colored Christmas lights dot the trailers roof lines, marking the season
One of the trailer doors  open and Jeep steps wearily out into the cool western morning
Home
Nothing but desert for miles in all directions, save for a two lane  and a weather beaten    that Jeep and his father will open for business in a few hours
Jeep gazes up to the diner's slanted roof where a large sign glows like a beacon in the darkness: "   `' " beat as Jeep contemplates the sign
(
) You okay, Jeep
Jeep turns to see , a very pregnant girl of about twenty, standing in the trailer doorway, rubbing the sleep from her eyes
Even with the trailer-trash veneer, she's strikingly beautiful
8
Sorry to wake you, Charlie
(stepping out of the trailer, hands on her ) Wasn't you
He's been kickin' up a storm all night
Must know somethin'  don't
She approaches Jeep
Sees the strain in his eyes
Another bad dream
He struggles for a moment, nods
It's just stress, Jeep, that's all
You do too much worryin'
About this place
About your dad
() About me
glimmer of a smile crosses Jeep's face
You're the only thing  like worrying about
See what  mean
You're worried about a girl eight months pregnant and it isn't even your baby
Now that's enough to give anybody nightmares
Jeep turns away, dejected
Go ahead, make fun of me
Everybody else does
(turns him back around) 'mon,  was only kiddin'
You know how much  appreciate everything you and Bob are doing for me, but a month from now, this baby'll have a new family and 'll have to start thinkin' about what the hell 'm doin' with my life
This is not news Jeep wants to hear
9
So you're still going through with it
Jeep, 'm not ready to be a mama
Christ,  can barely take care of myself as it is
could help you
We could do it together, you know
want to
Charlie smiles sadly at him, touched by his sweetness, but this just isn't where she's at
You gotta stop carryin' the weight of the world on your shoulders
Jeep nods, tries to hide the fact that he's dying inside
(rubbing her arms) Now can we go back in
'm freezing my ass off out here
Go on
'll be right there
Charlie kisses him on the cheek and heads back to the trailer
He watches her, longing in his eyes
With the clank of the door, she's gone
And over Jeep's troubled look, the perennial holiday cheer of ' "'   "  up
(
) don't know whether  like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings
: ' Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey has just met Clarence, his guardian angel-in-training
The signal  and  in and out
We hear a , which causes the image to momentarily improve and then slowly roll back the other way
( ) Oh, 've got to earn them and you'll help me, won't you
10
`'  - (late 40's), owner and proprietor of this fine roadside establishment, attempts to fix the old  hanging in the corner above the counter by banging the shit out it
The restaurant itself has the kind of grungy diner charm you'd hope to find in a place last renovated in 1963
An old plastic Christmas tree strung with flickering lights and tinsel occupies a lonely corner
Next to that, a faded diorama of the
The kind you might order off the Shopping Network
Bob considers the  with a frown
He deftly rolls an back and forth over the nicotine stained fingers of his right hand
Must be a nervous habit
You can tell just by looking at the man that he's a beer drinker
Behind the counter, a black man named   (60's) is cooking up a storm on the grill with spectacular one-handed dexterity
You do get pretty good at this sort of thing when your other hand has long been replaced by a
The dog tags around his neck tell the story
His white cook's hat has been temporarily replaced by a red Santa hat
Lord as my witness, Bob, one of these days that thing's gonna hit you back
Whaddya talkin' about, Percy
We got a special relationship here
Yeah, they got names for that kind a relationship
The  on the other side of the diner starts up with the tune "'   "
stunning looking sixteen-year-old  with dyed-black hair and a piercing or three, is leaning seductively over the jukebox, swaying gently to the music
The headband doubling as her mini-skirt reveals her knock-out figure in a way that really doesn't leave much up to the imagination
She's a billboard of rebellion
(
) It's disgusting
11
(
) You're right
It is disgusting
Watching the scintillating action from a booth across the diner is a conservatively dressed and
Fish out of water
Really, how can she go out in public wearing that
don't know
Why don't we just ask her
Howard, don't
You'll embarrass me
(shouting across the ) Audrey, honey
Your mother was wondering if you got dressed this morning with the specific intention of showing your ass off to the entire world
The girl who we now know as   turns to Howard with a caustic smile
Yeah, that's cuz  woke up hoping to get double teamed by a couple of meth head truckers in the bathroom of some desert shithole
() Good thing we stopped here
And with that she turns back to the jukebox
Percy watches the exchange discreetly from behind the counter
Loving it
Howard turns back to his wife
Rigid smile
feel satisfied with that answer
really do
Sandra buries her face in her hands
'm being punished for something, know it
12
Across the diner, Audrey goes back to swaying dreamily to the music, which is suddenly overtaken by  ' -
: The noontime sun bakes the strip of highway slicing through this barren country
blazes a path
thunder from within
-  - The stereo in this rig could shake mountains (late 20's) handsome as hell, thug style
straight up bad boy
He passes a weathered road sign: "  ,   50 " Kyle's expression says this is not good news
He grabs his cell phone off the passenger seat
No signal
Shit
He spots the truck stop diner just up the road ahead
`'  - The Escalade pulls off the highway and rolls to a stop at the lonely row of old gas pumps
Kyle gets out and surveys the scenery with dismay
Now in the daytime we see this is truly a place time forgot
Attached to the diner is a '
Grease stains and rusty car parts litter the ground
Behind the place is the we saw Jeep step out of earlier
The only thing here that looks fairly new is the parked in front of the garage with its hood up
Kyle grabs a crumpled hand drawn map from the front seat and flattens it out on the roof of the car
He spins it around
Which way is north
13
Darren, your fuckin' directions suck, man
He checks his cell phone again
No chance of a signal way out here
So he shuffles around to the side of the diner in search of a pay phone
The good news is that he finds one
The bad news is that it's been broken for ten years
Leaning next to the broken phone, however, is Charlie wearing a shabby, faded  uniform stretched tight around her very pregnant belly
Adding to her perfect mother-to-be look is that cigarette dangling from her lips
The plastic name tag pinned to her chest says ""
Hey
She eyes him, mildly intrigued, takes a drag
You know that shit right there ain't good for the baby
She lets out a long slow exhale
Guess  should think `bout quittin' then
Now hold on, girl, let me bum one before you do
You can buy a whole pack inside
Tell ya what
You let me have one of yours, and 'll give you two from the new pack you're gonna sell me
She considers him for a moment, then pulls out a cigarette
Lights it off the end of hers then hands it to him
Kyle takes a drag, pulls out his crumpled map
Am  in the right place
(peers at the map) Only if nowhere's right, `cause that's where you are
14
Sonuvabitch
There another phone around here
You know, one that works
Bob'll probably let you use the diner phone if you ask him real nice
And pay `im somethin'
can handle that
You got pancakes here
Yeah, we got a buttermilk stack for three seventy-five
We also got french toast for four dollars if you're into that
personally like the pancakes though
(
) You okay, Charlie
They both turn to see Jeep behind the diner, wearing mechanic's coveralls and holding a
Charlie quickly hides her cigarette behind her back
Busted
Yeah, 'm okay
This guy's just lost
Jeep nods, uncertain, eyes Kyle another moment, then he shuffles along out of sight
Charlie brings the cigarette back up to her lips
An awkward beat
Three seventy-five, huh
`'  - The
Charlie and Kyle enter
Audrey's eyes light up when she sees Kyle
He notices her as well
How couldn't he
She's directing every ounce of sex appeal she has in his direction
Her parents, on the other hand, shoot a look of utter fear in Kyle's direction, as if he personified their worst suburban nightmare
Charlie heads to the register
Digs out a fresh pack of smokes from underneath the counter
15
hope Salem Lights are okay, `cause that's all we got left
If  can smoke `em, 'll take `em
(
) Where ya been, Charlie
Bob steps off the chair
This ain't a resort you know got orders stacking up here
In truth there aren't any orders stacking up, but it certainly makes Bob feel better to say it
(sees the two cigarettes Kyle's handing her) You best not be smokin' again
Not in your condition
(gestures to the diner) Bob, do you see where am  right now
Can my condition really get any worse
`Sides, you ain't one to talk
What
quit two years ago
Yeah, so why you still carryin' that fancy lighter `round for
It was a gift from my ex-wife, alright
'm sentimental
don't wanna forget how much  hate her guts
Hey man
Bob turns to Kyle
Doesn't like what he sees
Can  use your phone
My cell doesn't get a signal out here and the pay phone outside is busted
Bob is about to respond when: 16
(
) Excuse me
Howard approaches, oblivious to the conversation he's interrupting
Any news about when our truck might be fixed
You said your boy would have us on the road two hours ago
The rate we're going, we'll be lucky to make it to Scottsdale by Christmas
Bob's expression darkens at this news
Goddamn it
Where the hell is Jeep
: cloth wipes away the dirt, revealing the partial image of an  carved into the surface
'  - Jeep is carefully cleaning the old wooden crib on a workbench
There's an unsettling intensity in his eyes, as if fear itself were driving him
(
) Hey, Leonardo
Jeep freezes, knows he's in trouble He reluctantly turns to see his father standing next to the Anderson's broken-down Uhual
The fact that this truck's hood's up mean anything to you
Jeep stares at the ground
Couldn't be anymore uncomfortable
Yeah
(approaches, peering past him to the crib) () 17
(cont'd) Whaddya workin' on that's so goddamn important you're not doin' your job
Nothin'
Jeep tries feebly to block his path, fails
Bob looks down at the crib with dismay
Found it under a bunch of stuff in the storage shed
know you never like to throw anything away
Bob considers him, softens
Whaddya doin'
What
Jeep,  like Charlie
do
And think it's real good of you to lend her a helping hand, but she is not your responsibility
(heard this before, pushes past him) Oh whatever, leave me alone
Don't walk away from me while 'm talkin' to you
`'  - Jeep walks out toward the gas pumps, but Bob's right alongside him, not giving up
How long you gonna follow her around like a puppy dog
Cleanin' up the messes she makes while she steps out with every guy around here other than you
Jeep stiffens
Turns to his father: Don't say that about her
She's not like that
18
Bob gives Jeep a hard stare
Yeah, she is
You really think she's gonna stick around here after that baby's born and off her hands
Jeeps shakes his head, burns
Look,  know it doesn't make any sense to you, but it's just something  have to do
Bob sighs, feels for his boy
(points up at the sign) See that up there
Your mother thought  was crazy for wanting to buy this place, middle of nowhere
But  just knew this was what  was supposed to do
Told your mom, "just wait
" Told her when they finally ran the freeway through here like they were plannin' on, this place would be like Grand Central Station
() But  was wrong
The freeway never came and now the only people who ever stop here are the ones who are lost
() And your mom
Well she got tired of waitin'
'mon Dad
You can't blame yourself for what she did-- Yeah,  can
And 'm sayin' you're about to make the same damn mistake made, believing in something that's never gonna happen
Or someone
() It's time for you to move on from this place, Jeep
don't wanna see you wake up one morning old and pissed off, realizing you're lost just like everybody else who stops here
19
Jeep looks up at his father, his words hanging heavily tough pill to swallow
Now get to work on that truck wanna have these people on the road by nightfall
Bob walks back into the diner
Jeep is about to turn back to the garage when he notices something off in the distance
Ominous   line the horizon to the south like a living wall
He shifts his gaze up the highway to the north
Same thing
are pushing their way over the distant mountains
storm is coming
`'  - Bob reenters the diner to find Kyle sitting at the counter, digging into a plate of banana pancakes
Kyle is about to address him again, when something else steals Bob's attention
(holding up a silencing ) Yeah, wait a minute
The  has gone on the fritz again
Only now the image is mostly snow
Bob climbs back onto the chair
Faces the
What's wrong with you today
The image flickers but doesn't improve
told you to get the satellite
But you don't wanna listen
What the hell do  need that crap for
History Channel, man
20
got all the history  can take
That's for sure
What's your problem now
Where do  start
You know this was the top-of-the- line model when  bought it
Yeah, in the Fifties
You shouldn't be watchin' anyways
(rubs his hands together) Okay, baby, this is gonna do it
Bob gives the  one final wallop --
And the picture snaps into
Only it isn't the picture he was expecting
The        and its accompanying   fill the diner
Everybody in the place stops and turns to the
See
Clear as day
Nice work, Bob
What the hell's that
It's just one of those test things
That'd be true, except for the words at the bottom of the screen, which read: "    " Bob switches the channels
All the same
Don't look like a test
21
Bob steps off the chair and backs slowly away from the  as if a little distance will bring some clarity
He bumps into Kyle
Yo, am  the Invisible motherfuckin' Man here
Do you have a phone or not
Kyle peels a five dollar bill off a serious
That gets Bob's attention
Bob snaps the money out of his hand
In the back past the kitchen
Make it fast
Kyle hustles passed Percy
Charlie is standing by the Anderson's table, clearing dishes
Everybody's eyes are locked on the
If there's a real emergency aren't they supposed to give us some information about what to do
'm sure it's a mistake
Hey, Percy, give that old radio of yours a shot
Maybe they got some news about the
Percy grabs an old battery powered radio off a kitchen shelf
Switches it on
He spins the dial until he reaches a clear signal
The same   of Emergency Broadcasting
Station after station the same thing
The diner is overwhelmed by a chilling chorus of Everyone goes very still
(
) Let me talk to him
-   - Kyle sits at a messy desk in this dark, wood paneled back office, phone to his ear
22
(') (on phone) Cuz a father should be able to talk to his son, that's why
Now put `im on the phone
(a beat then a smile) Is that my little man
Yeah, well 'm working hard, so that can be with you
You bein' good
(strange  can be ) Wait
You're breakin' up
Hello
(hangs up in frustration) Shit
Kyle stews a beat, then picks up the phone to redial
Frowns
No dial tone
What the hell
He keeps trying
Nothing
(
) Maybe there was an earthquake
- Everyone is looking at Howard
They keep sayin' we're overdue for a big one
Lot a folks could be hurt
Not if it was centered in the desert
Exactly
Could be nothing to worry about
So then why's the  out
Maybe it just hit the relay stations
Aren't those usually in remote areas
23
Yeah, `cause of the radiation they give off
There ain't no radiation comin' from those things
Plus that don't explain the radio being out too
Some of those stations broadcast over hundreds of miles
Any quake that big and we would a felt it
Percy's right
didn't feel nothing
Maybe it's a terrorist attack or something
(covers her mouth) Oh god
Everyone considers that grimly, then: Well, for cryin' out loud
There's no use in speculating
'll just call my brother up in Needles
He must a heard something
(
) don't think so
Kyle has reappeared in the diner
Whaddya talkin' about
Phone's dead
Just tried to make a call
You're shittin' me
Kyle shakes his head, sits down at the counter
Oh, this is just great
Relax, Mrs
Anderson
Nothing to get excited about
Probably just working on the lines
() 24
(cont'd) Sides, 'm sure Jeep'll have your truck fixed up quick as can be, and then you'll be on your way
''  - Jeep is buried under the Uhaul's hood, working at something with a socket wrench
It's not going well
Damn it
He pulls himself up
Grease covers his face and hands
The sound of a   catches his attention
He watches as a beat up    pulls off the highway and rolls to a stop at the pumps
It's a mystery how anyone could see through the    on that windshield
After a moment the car door pops open and the swing down to the ground, followed by the metal frame and wheels of a walker
The    gets out of the car, steadies herself on the walker, and then slowly makes her way toward the diner with the rickety frailness of an old turtle
Jeep watches her disappear inside
He then looks toward the horizon again
The are growing ever closer
''  - as the old lady enters
She surveys the scene as if feasting on paradise
Maybe her eyes aren't so good
Have a seat wherever you want, Ma'am
Specials are on the board
Thank you, dear
The old lady settles at a table across from the Andersons
She smiles at them pleasantly
Charlie is about to hand her a menu, when: Oh,  already know what  want
Okay, what'll it be
25
'll have the steak, please
And how'd you like that cooked
Rare if you would
And water, no ice
Coming right up
Charlie, is it
Yeah
What an unusual name for a girl
So they say
'll be right back with your water
The old lady turns to the Andersons
Hello, 'm Gladys
Gladys Foster
Nice to meet you, Gladys
'm Sandra and this is my husband Howard
What a nice young couple you are
What brings you out to these parts
We're moving out to Scottsdale
But our truck broke down, and so we're stuck here while it's being fixed
Oh, what a nuisance
begins to buzz around Gladys's head
She doesn't seem to notice it
Say, Gladys, it seems the lines are down around here
The phone and , you know
() 26
(cont'd) And  just was wondering if you might have heard something on your way up
You know, about what's going on
Gladys smiles strangely
Oh, don't worry yourself about that, sweetheart
It'll all be over soon
Sandra nods at the old woman, unsure of what to make of that response
The fly that was circling her head, now lands on ' It crawls across her cheek without her reacting in the least
Howard and Sandra exchange looks
Creepy
The door  and Jeep walks in
He heads straight for a quiet huddle with Bob
All the while though, he keeps one eye fixed on the old lady sitting at the table near the Andersons
Something about her
The carburetor's shot
Don't know why
Looks brand new
(glances over at the ) Ah, shit
They're gonna be pissed
could try to rebuild it, but it'd take a while, and  don't think we have all the parts
If we call right now, we might be able to get a new one down here tomorrow morning
That's not gonna happen
Goddamn phone's out
What
Across the diner, Charlie places a bloody red steak in front of Gladys
Thank you, dear
How far along are you
27
Charlie rests a hand on her belly
Just about there
The father must be very proud
wouldn't know
You mean he's
Out of sight
Out of mind
Oh,  see
So you're not married, take it
fly lands on Gladys's steak
Charlie tries to wave it away
But another one lands in its place
Nope
Gladys starts to dig in to the steak with a real ferociousness you wouldn't expect from an old lady
More begin to land on her body
On her food
Charlie is still trying to wave them away
That's too bad
No,  prefer it that way
don't a need a man tellin' me what to do
But what about the baby
've got it under control
Yeah, but it's gonna burn
Charlie freezes
The Andersons turn to look as well
Kyle glances over from the counter
What did you just say
28
(all smiles) said your fucking baby's gonna burn
Charlie shakes her head at the woman, not giving in
Go to hell, lady
She slaps the check down on the table and walks back toward the kitchen, passing Jeep and Bob
What happened
Total fucking Jesus freak
Gladys begins to laugh innocently as she continues to devour her meat
Red juice drips down her chin
The flies are swarming now
How did so many get in here
Sandra and Howard are mortified at this sudden turn of events
All those babies
They're gonna burn
Gladys, please
There's no reason to -- Gladys's head suddenly whips toward her
Shut up, you stupid fucking cunt
All you do is complain
Complain
Complain
Sandra covers her mouth in shock
Everybody in the diner is now focused on the old lady
Howard gets up from the booth
Howard, it's okay
Don't listen to her
But Howard's already standing over Gladys
Who the hell do you think you are, lady
Now, 'd like you to apologize to my -- 29
as Howard crumbles to the floor
Gladys rockets to her feet, knocking her table over
Blood covers her face and chest
You're all going to fucking die
Percy is the first to react
From behind the counter, he whips a heavy metal frying pan at Gladys that knocks her head sideways
Impossibly, Gladys is still standing
She lets out an   and , knocking tables and chairs over in her wake
Bob pulls a shotgun from behind the counter
Don't move
But Gladys not only moves, Bob can't believe his eyes
But he gets over it real fast, as the crab lady rushes toward him --    -- , trying to take her down, but he can't track her fast enough
Instead he blows   in the ceiling, a rain of plaster
Gladys drops down right in front of Bob
(struggles to cock the ) Fuck
Gladys smiles sweetly before The shotgun clatters to the floor at Jeep's feet
He snatches it up and aims it at Gladys who turns calmly to face him
Shoot her, Jeep
Jeep's about to fire, when the old lady's
30
(a sickly sweet smile) You'll never save her
Jeep freezes, stunned by her words, overwhelming fear paralyzing him where he stands
Gladys rockets straight at him
But Jeep's too afraid to move
He clamps his eyes shut, bracing himself for the end
, taking her down like an animal
Jeep slowly opens his eyes
His gun's still cocked
Gladys lies dead in a smoldering, bloody heap at his feet
He turns to see Kyle with smoke rising from the barrel of his silver plated   45
If everyone wasn't so shocked, they'd probably be wondering why this guy is packing such serious heat
(
) Somebody help me
Sandra is on the floor with her husband
Blood pours freely from his neck
Kyle stares at the dying man -- a moment of hesitation -- then he rushes to help
Press your hands over the hole
Sandra looks fearfully up at Kyle, at the gun still in his hand
Don't look at me like that, lady
'm tryin' to fuckin' help you
Now put your goddamn hands over the hole before your husband bleeds to death
Obeying, she cups her hands over the hole in his neck, desperately trying to stop the flow of blood leaking out between her fingers
Percy scrambles over with a first-aid kit and together he and Kyle get to work on Howard's neck
31
few feet away, Charlie helps Bob, bruised and bleeding, to his feet
The fuck was that
What the fuck was that
Across the diner, Audrey is pushed back into a booth, her knees pulled tightly to her chest, shivering
Her adult facade giving way to that of a frightened child ' , causing her to look up and see Gladys's
An ungodly horror
''  - Kyle, Percy, Sandra and Audrey frantically carry Howard, his neck bandaged, to the back of the Escalade
- Howard lies in the back seat
Sandra by his head, clasping his hands in hers
Audrey by his feet
Percy rides shotgun
Kyle struggles to get the key in the ignition
The engine  to life
`'  - The Escalade fishtails onto the highway
- Kyle grips the wheel
Picking up speed
How far to the hospital
Seventy, maybe eighty miles
Kyle shoots him a look
Eighty miles
Pedal to the floor time
Audrey leans forward from the back seat
What's that on the road
Up ahead, the   Jeep saw earlier have finally closed in, descending onto the highway like a
32
They're fuckin' clouds
What the fuck do they look like
Not clouds
Clouds don't buzz
She's right
They're black
Undulating
Suddenly     begin to  the windshield -- And that's when they realize it
Those aren't clouds
'
The Escalade enters the
The car is  by insects, the windshield instantly covered in bug guts
Driving blind
The sound of   and  is deafening
Everyone  as hell surrounds them
- Bob is hunched over the steaming sink, pounding a can of light beer
Jeep is leaning against the wall, looking like he's about to puke or faint
don't understand how she was still standin' after Percy hit `er with that goddamn fryin' pan
Broke her fuckin' neck
saw it
swear  did
() And did you see that kid's gun
The hell's he doin' with a gun like that
Bob looks over at Jeep, sees him trembling
It's okay, Jeep
It's okay
But for Jeep it's not okay
He's hurting real bad inside
couldn't pull the trigger froze
saw what  needed to do, but  was afraid
(breaks down) She could've killed you
() 33
(cont'd) Or Charlie
She would've killed me if it wasn't for
He can't get the words out
Bob rests a hand on his boy's shoulder
There's nothin' to be ashamed of, Jeep
() Not everybody can play the hero
Before Jeep can respond, they hear the sound of the front ''  - Bob and Jeep appear from the back, as Kyle, Percy, Audrey and Sandra carry Howard into the diner, all of them stumbling, gasping for air
Charlie moves in to help
Percy races for the back
(catching Percy by the ) Where you going
To get my bible
The hell you need that for
Well somebody's gotta start prayin'
Bob's about to respond when he hears the
Bob, Charlie and Jeep slowly approach the windows to see the '
Everything in the diner is suddenly cast in   as the day's remaining sunlight filters through the swarm
Apocalyptic
No one breathes
: 34
Revealing a bloody mess of muscles and tendons chewed down to the bone
''  - Percy and Charlie are tending to Howard
Sandra is holding her husband's hand, trying to comfort him, while Audrey watches from a distance with grim fascination
(raises a bottle of ) Okay, hold `em steady
(nods, peakish, to ) Oh god, please don't throw up
Howard writhes as Percy pours alcohol on the wound
Sandra can't help but stare at Percy's hook
Meanwhile across the diner, Bob and Jeep peel back the tablecloth to examine Gladys' bullet riddled corpse
Kyle stands over them with Bob's shotgun trained on the body -- just in case
Gladys is a real horror show
Bones jut out at obtuse angles from her neck -- a result of the blow to her head from Percy's frying pan
She's cold as a freakin' ice cube
If  hadn't just seen her walk in here, 'd say the old bag's been dead for hours
Bob rolls Gladys over, revealing her face -- her enlarged mouth filled with dozens of razor sharp baby teeth
Well,  don't care how long she's been dead, the bitch ain't stayin' in here with us
''  - Bob, Kyle and Jeep quickly drag Gladys's body wrapped in the plastic table cloth a short ways from the diner
They warily eye the curtain of  no more than a hundred yards out
35
don't get it
Why don't they come closer
How the fuck am  supposed to know, man
You askin' me to explain the behavior of a motherfuckin' pestilence
and Jeep notices the old lady's car keys have dropped to the ground
(holding up the keys) You guys
' Its windows are completely caked with dust
The men a layer of brown from the glass, allowing them to peer inside the car
You see anything
No Twilight Zone shit if that's what you mean
Jeep slips the key into the driver's side door
Unlocks it
Careful
Old lady could have some kind of rabid poodle locked up in there
Jeep slowly swings the door open and that's when the smell hits them
Agh
What the fuck is that
Bob covers his nose
Jesus
Kyle opens the passenger door, looks in
Dark, dirty
But nothing unusual
Nothin' here
36
How `bout the trunk
They go around to the
Jeep slips the key in
The trunk  open, revealing a
Bob quickly slams the trunk closed
The guys are reeling with disgust
Kyle's trying to blow the stench from his nose
Bitch's got motherfuckin' dead cats in her hoopty
What the fuck is wrong with white people
Least now we know where that smell was coming from
Yeah, it was a real motherfuckin' necessity we figured that out, man
(sees something up the ) Hey
They turn to see  growing larger in the dim haze
careens off the highway and skids to a wild stop in front of the diner
Its   as the dust clears around it
No movement can be seen behind its bug splattered windows
Okay, now we're talkin'
Wait a minute
Check it out
It's What's an  cop doing way out here
Bob and Jeep look over at Kyle
'm from Nevada, man
They consider the police car a moment more
See the , the
37
Give me the shotgun
Kyle hands the shotgun over to Bob
''  - Charlie's face lights up when she sees the police car
Oh, thank God, the police
''  - The door of the    as Charlie races from the diner
The three men see her moving toward the car
Jeep's face goes slack
Charlie, wait
The men begin to run toward her
While out of the police car steps
Charlie freezes a few feet from the car when she sees those piercing eyes already familiar to us
Michael looks at her, as if she was exactly who he expected to see
In moments Bob, Kyle and Jeep form a protective shield in front of Charlie
Bob raises the shotgun
Take one step closer and 'll drop you right here
long beat as Michael considers Bob
Icy cold
That how you greet all your customers
Mister, after what we've been through here today, you're lucky we didn't shoot you first and greet you later
Now let me see your teeth
Michael stares at him blankly
38
Your teeth goddamn it
Lemme see `em
Michael offers up a dangerous smile, revealing a not so well kept but definitely normal set of teeth
Bob and the others ease slightly
No, shark teeth, Pop
Bob lowers the gun
Okay
Suppose you tell us your name then
Michael
Sorry about all that, Michael
This old lady just went crazy inside my place here
She had these teeth
Never seen anything like `em
Practically bit a man in half
Michael remains silent
Doesn't seemed shocked in the least by what he's heard
So what are you doin' out here
Gotta say you don't exactly look like a police officer
Even one from
Then again, you have to be, right
mean, who the hell'd be crazy enough to steal a cop car
Bob chuckles for a moment
When Michael doesn't respond in kind, Bob falls silent
Anxious
He slowly raises the shotgun again
Michael sizes up this raggedy group
His gaze drifts over to the loosely wrapped body in front of the diner
The plastic table cloth flaps wildly in the wind
Turning back to Bob: You don't know, do you
Know what
39
We don't know anything
Nothing's working here
The , the radio, the phone
Michael just shakes his head
'm running out of time
Michael steps toward Charlie with a sense of purpose, but Bob blocks his path, brandishing the shotgun
Back off, fella
() Now,  don't care if this is the second coming of Jesus fucking Christ,  say it's time for you to either get talkin' or get the hell outta here
In a   , Michael rips the shotgun from Bob's hands
It all happens so fast that Bob is stunned to find himself holding air
He's even more stunned to now have the barrel of the gun pressed to the bridge of his nose
Everyone freezes
Easy
Easy
Michael's expression is totally calm
Merciless
'mon, Dad, tell `em you're sorry
Tell `em you were only kidding
But Bob can't even speak, he's so scared
He squeezes his eyes closed
Let `em go
Michael's eyes flit momentarily in Charlie's direction
Considering her
The diner door opens and Percy steps cautiously out with hand and hook held up to show no threat
He's followed by Sandra and Audrey
Michael sees them, but offers no indication that he cares
40
Now, son, 'm sure you don't wanna go spillin' blood for no good reason in front of all these decent people, do ya
Our friend Bob here ain't worth the trouble it'd cause ya
() So whaddya say `bout just lettin' `im go and then you can be on your way
Nice `n' easy
But Michael doesn't seem to register this plea
It's not looking good
No one
That's when Kyle notices something out in the direction of the road
What the--
Michael turns, sees the lights
They're here
Michael whips the gun away from Bob's head and thrusts it back into his hands
Bob's looks down at the gun, speechless
You're going to need this
Michael walks swiftly around to the trunk of the cruiser
Pops it, revealing a staggering
Percy stares out at the lights, eyes wide
Lord, have mercy
(waving back Audrey and ) You ladies best get back inside
What is it
What's happening
Who is this man
Why's he driving a police car
Shut up, mom
41
Audrey pulls her mother back into the diner
Michael hands an MP5 -  to Kyle
Another one goes to Percy
Finally he places a third one in Jeep's hands, who stares down at it anxiously
Wait
don't think that's such a good idea
Dad,  can handle it
(to Michael) He's just a kid -- said,  can handle it
Michael's eyes narrow, studying Jeep
He can handle it
He doesn't have a choice
Michael pulls out twin MP5s for himself
9s are tucked everywhere they can go
Michael tosses clip belts to the men
Boxes of shotgun shells
The works
If you want to live, you'll do exactly as  say
He slams the trunk closed and approaches Charlie
He cocks a Glock and hands it to her
When you fire, you keep your thumb off the slide
Don't hesitate
Don't do anything brave
There's no safety
He gives her a hard look
She nods nervously
Trusting him but not sure why
Michael marches into the diner
Kyle glances quickly at the others, then he bolts after Michael
Percy follows
Then Charlie
Now it's only Jeep and his father left
'mon, Jeep
We gotta go
42
And Bob rushes into the diner
moment as Jeep looks out toward the road
He contemplates the sub-machine gun in his hands
Fuck it
And races after his father
: Thrown
Locking the diner door
''  - Frantic activity
Kyle and Michael push a booth in front of the door, sealing off the entrance
Tables are turned on their sides to form makeshift shields
Window blinds are snap closed
- Jeep races in, locks the back door
Then he pushes a desk in front of it
- The place is transformed
Locked up tight
The outside grows ever ,
Sandra huddles on the floor with Howard, his head in her lap
She's running her hands gently through his hair, trying to keep calm
He opens his eyes
Pale, weak from blood loss
Sandra
What's happening
It's okay
Everything's okay
Sandra closes her eyes
Struggling to believe it
Suddenly the   , dipping the room into 43
We hear
Chaos
(
) Jeep, get the flashlights
(
) Everybody just stay still
(
) Now that we're locked in here, what the fuck are we supposed to do
flicker of
And then coming to rest on Michael's pale face
Michael looks up at the ceiling
''  -  - hatch opens and out comes Michael followed by Bob, Percy and Kyle
They quickly take their places behind the "Paradise" sign
Pitch black surrounds them
The    is gone, leaving only the coming up off the desert
Where the hell did they go
Bob turns to Michael sharply
Alright, Rambo
You got us up here
Now you mind explaining what the fuck we're fighting
Michael is about to answer, when: Listen
Over the wind, another sound becomes audible
The delicate chime of a
You hear what 'm hearing
Yeah
The hell is that
The   grows louder, the melody more distinct
Now we recognize the song:
But instead of filling them with cheer, it fills them with dread
44
It sounds almost like
Ice cream
appear in the   darkness
And sure enough, an rolls slowly   toward the diner
The emanates from   a speaker on its roof
It's too dark to see who's behind the   wheel
You've got to be fuckin' kidding me
Alright
There's a safety switch on the side of your gun
Push it all the way down
Two clicks
The men quickly do as they're told
Now when this starts, you hold on tight, you hear me
If you don't, you're going to blow your hand off
Understand
Kyle, Bob shoot quick anxious looks at Percy
The fuck y'all lookin' at me for
''  - Jeep faces the boarded up front door, awkwardly holding the MP5, trying to assume a tough guy posture
If only he could stop shaking, it might be believable
Charlie and Audrey peer between the slats covering the windows
The   '  fan across the diner
Audrey and Charlie back away from the windows
Charlie stops next to Jeep
Senses him shaking
Rests a hand on his arm
And that seems to help
a little
Howard smiles weakly at the familiar sound of the
Oh, honey, listen
It's the Ice Cream Man
45
''  -  - The Ice Cream Truck pulls to a stop with its headlights facing the diner
Everyone aims their guns at the truck
Tense
From the Ice Cream Truck
a     to the ground
up the long grey pant leg spotted with blood stains to reveal a skeletally thin man in tattered coveralls
Say hello to
He looks like he's been through hell -- literally
As he steps into the beams of the headlights we can see him even more clearly
He's tall
Too tall
His clothes don't seem to fit him
And he's unnaturally thin as if he's been stretched like taffy
If he got down on all fours, you might mistake him for some kind of spider
He surveys the diner, the garage, the roof -- assessing the situation
On the roof, the men wait for something to happen
() Ah, he don't look that bad
The Ice Cream Man's gaze snaps up to the roof
He heard
Oh, shit
Oh, shit
Oh, shit
That's when the Ice Cream Man's  , with the sickening sound of
From his new mouth, the Ice Cream Man lets out an earth shattering
Everyone except Michael is practically hyperventilating with fear
Get ready
And the     for the diner with His movements aren't at all like those of a normal man, but rather like some kind of
Michael aims
46
Bullets rip into the creature's body, knocking him flat on his back
Still
Arms and legs in a twisted, twitching mess
Michael keeps his aim
Waits
The  music continues to play
Is that it
Not even close freeway full of  of every variety punch through the wall of dust, racing toward the diner
They are Now
Shoot now
The men let loose with
Vehicles swerve and
bolt from the burning vehicles, scattering
In the    we catch glimpses of them: All deformed by some demonic force
Many mere    drifting through the darkness
Spread out
Don't let them get close to the windows
The   converge on the diner from all directions
They move so strangely fast it seems that their feet don't actually touch the ground
From the roof it's a full-on turkey shoot as the men follow Michael's instructions and cut down everything in sight
Their faces lighting up with each
spray from their weapons like water drops from a sprinkler
and crumble to the dirt
The creatures don't seem to be afraid of dying
Their strategy appears to be in their sheer numbers
With each wave, the dark figures get ever closer to the diner
47
firing madly
Then
Oh, no
He's out of ammo
Shells
Percy tosses him a box of shells
But Bob fumbles the catch and the box slides halfway down the sloped roof
Fuck
With the gun still in one hand, Bob reaches frantically down for the ammo
Stretching
Further
- Her hair must have been in curlers before most of it
Her nightdress hangs in tatters off her body
Her jaw  , as she clatters up at Bob like a
Bob tries to pull back, but he has no traction and he starts to slip down toward her
She's coming fast
Percy sees his friend in trouble
Bob
Bob swings the shotgun like a club --
-- knocking the bitch clear off the roof
But the move has made his slide even faster
He drops the shotgun, trying to hold on, but he can't stop
She doesn't even have a chance to react as Bob does something akin to a swimmer's push right off her body
The creature goes flying back off the roof and the opposing force halts Bob's slide
(extending his hook) Grab my hand
Bob reaches up and clasps Percy's hook, praying that it stays on
But this chick ain't finished yet
Up she comes once more
Her razor sharp fingernails claw up the metal roof
Gun
48
Percy tosses Bob a Glock
Fortunately this time Bob deftly catches it with his free hand just as the deranged woman pounces on him
(jamming the gun in her ) Fuck off
The back of her head
Her body goes limp
Bob struggles to push the corpse off of him
Pull me up
Percy extends his hook hand, helping Bob ascend to safety
`'  - Hiding in the shadows
listening to sounds of  just outside
Sandra squeezes her hands over her ears
few feet away, Audrey clutches a butcher's knife
Jeep's eyes darting from one window to another
Trying to keep it together
Charlie is crouched down behind the counter, holding the handgun close to her pregnant belly
Distant rattle the plates on the shelves
Charlie peers out from behind the counter to look at the front windows
Momentary  of intense light outline the closed blinds
Another  lights up Charlie's face
Staring
''  -  - Percy is swivelling left and right, firing like mad
Come on, motherfuckers
Come on
Closer and closer the creatures come
Most are eviscerated by the fire from the rooftop

''  - staring at the window
Charlie's eyes go wide as -- crashes through the window
Glass, sand and dust swirl in
Audrey and Sandra
Charlie springs up from her hiding place, gun ready
Jeep spins around, pointing his gun, searching frantically for the intruder
It's so dark
Where is it
Audrey shakes her head, tears streaming down her cheeks
She looks over at her mother
Sandra's eyes are closed
It's too much
Mom
Open your eyes
can't
can't
Suddenly Howard's body is   from Sandra
Something's got hold of his legs
That gets Sandra's eyes open
(springing after her ) Howard
Howard screams deliriously as he's dragged rapidly through the diner toward the broken front window
He flails about, desperately trying to grab a hold of something
Sandra scrambles after her husband
Reaching for him
Daddy
The creature reaches the window
Sandra dives for Howard's outstretched hands
She has him
The creature's progress is abruptly halted at the shattered window
It turns back toward Sandra -- a shaft of light falling across its face, reveals: of about Audrey's age
Her skin is a deathly blue
Her pupils a
50
Deep human fingernail scratches have torn open the bloated flesh on her arms, neck and face
The self-inflicted wounds of a drug addict
Her voice is not
See what you made me do, mother
Sandra screams, holds on
No
Charlie and Audrey rush to Sandra's side, grabbing Howard's arms
Jeep is right behind them ready to fire at the creature, but with the women in the way, he can't get a clear shot
So he discards the gun and grabs Howard's arms
Howard screams as his body is torturously stretched
human tug-of-war
'  -- Howard's body lurches further out the window
Howard
Howard's torso is almost entirely out the window
Charlie daringly reaches for Howard's belt, desperate to gain leverage
'
Charlie screams as she's yanked painfully toward the window, losing her grip on Howard's belt
Through the broken window, she sees the face of a He smiles at her like a father coming home to his baby girl
() There you are
And he starts to pull her arm even harder
Other creatures suddenly notice her as well, focusing their attack as if she alone was their target
Jeep immediately let's go of Howard and dives for Charlie, grabbing her free arm just before she's pulled through
51
Without the help, Audrey and Sandra can't hold on any longer
Howard is ripped from of his family's hands and out the window
Daddy
`'  -  - The tide is turning
The men seem to have gotten their game on and the dark shapes are starting to pull back
They're running
We got `em
Kyle turns happily to Michael
Gone
Kyle looks around the roof with alarm
''  - Only a few more inches separate Charlie and certain death through the window
Jeep's losing her
Charlie and Jeep fall back into the diner, the claw like hands still grasping Charlie's arm no longer attached to their owners
Michael leaps over her, a butcher's knife in one hand, a machine gun in the other
He lights up everything in his path
The window blinds become a
Creatures and flee into the night, having successfully taken their first victim
Charlie flings the severed appendages off her and she and Jeep scoot away from the window
Hysterical, Sandra tries to push past Michael
She's going after Howard
He intercepts her before she can make it out
Let me go
He's alive
Sandra slaps at him frantically as he carries her away from the window and thrusts her down into a back booth
He's alive
No
Not anymore
Sandra breaks down
52
As Charlie climbs slowly to her feet -- a sudden pain
She clutches her belly
Winces
Jeep catches her arm to steady her
() 'm okay
'm fine
She glances back at Michael
He's watching her
Those eyes
Thanks
told you not to do anything brave
Charlie doesn't know how to respond
She's about to say something when -- Kyle rushes into the room
smile on his face
We got `em runnin'
Then Kyle notices the broken window, takes in the room, his excitement falling
Where's Howard
No one responds
Sandra and Audrey are huddled together
Crying
Bob and Percy follow Kyle in, still shaking from the adrenaline
Someone needs to be on the roof
'll go
Bob grabs Kyle's arm
Hold on
(approaches Michael, ) You better start talking
All eyes on Michael
These people want answers
Finally: 53
The first time God lost faith in Man he sent a flood
The second time
he sent what you see outside
Everyone takes that in for a moment, then: You sayin' this is the Apocalypse
'm saying this is an extermination
() Those things out there are vessels
The Possessed
The weakest willed are the easiest to turn
Possessed by what
Demons
No
by angels
That silences the room
(pulls out his bible) Son,  don't know what bible you been readin', but in my version, the angels are the good guys
Michael looks squarely at Percy
That's where your book is wrong
How come you know so much about them
know because until last night, was on their side
You mean you're
Michael considers Jeep, then: Not anymore
54
Right and yesterday  was the fuckin' Easter Bunny
You know, fuck this
don't even believe in God
That's fine, because He doesn't believe in you either
Bob stares at Michael, uncertain how to respond to that
'mon, Bob
Have you looked outside recently
Those aren't exactly our regular customers out there
How do we know he didn't bring them here himself
He brings them here and then he saves us from them
You're a genius, Bob
Bob falls silent, confounded
Audrey hesitantly approaches Michael
So you're here to protect us
Not you
(looks at Charlie) Her
Charlie reacts in shock, as all eyes are suddenly on her
Me
Why me
Because your child is the only hope humanity has of surviving
In response to that, Charlie does the only thing someone can do when told such a thing
She
No way
But Michael isn't joking and Charlie's laughter becomes genuine fear
55
() Jesus Christ
Exactly
Jeep stares at Charlie, as if suddenly his entire life is starting to make sense
You're sayin' she's the mother of the Messiah
Wait a minute, isn't Mary supposed to be a vi-- Go fuck yourself, Bob
Makes you wonder about Mary
(approaches Michael, panic setting in) Look, this is not possible
'm just a waitress
'm nobody can't give birth to the Savior of Mankind
(and finally) don't even own a car
None of that matters anymore
Either your child lives or Mankind dies
So what, we're supposed to just hold those things off until Mary over there squeezes one out
That's right
That can't be
'm only eight months pregnant
Oh we're fucked
We are so fucked
56
How are we supposed to survive here for a month
We won't have to
At this Charlie goes white, the realization hitting her
It's coming soon, isn't it
Michael nods
Charlie sways on her feet
Jeep rests a hand on her shoulder, steadying her
With a  Michael re-arms his weapon, turns to the group with finality
If you want to live you'll do what say
This first attack was a test of our strength
The next one will be a test of our weakness
() Something much worse is on its way
Everyone exchanges terrified looks
Finally, Kyle steps forward
Okay, what's your plan
We'll keep watch on the roof in shifts of two
Jeep, go get some tools
We need to close up this window before somebody else goes out
Jeep looks anxiously at Charlie, silent, scared, and then he follows after Michael, leaving Charlie to stare at the , the blinds flipping wildly in the wind
''  -  - Percy and Kyle keep watch, rifles at their sides
They're wrapped up from head to toe in blankets to protect them from the cold and the flies
Percy scans the horizon
Momentary   dot the darkness
57
They're out there
Sons of bitches
can feel `em
() Damn it's cold
Percy makes the unconscious motion of rubbing his "hands" together to keep them warm
Kyle notices
Sees the dog tags
You were in the Army
Navy, two tours
But the second one didn't work out so well, so didn't get to go back for a third
Suppose that makes me lucky in a way
Served with Bob, you know
That's how  ended up in this place
What was it like
Being in a war
Dark
Like this
Kyle nods
Scared
He takes out his 45
Nervously switches it from hand to hand
So what's with that gun
What
Your piece
The one you killed grandma with
Don't reckon it's for huntin' buck
No
uh -- keep it for protection
Protection from what
From people
Percy looks at him skeptically
People
58
Yeah, people who might try to give me a hard time, you know
Just regular people or uh
Yeah, well, no, not regular, regular people
Irregular people then
'm talkin' people whose job it is to give other people a hard time
Kinda person who doesn't get enough fiber in their diet, you know what 'm sayin
So it's a work thing, is it
Exactly
Strictly business
This business of yours
You like it
Kyle's eyes narrow
Who the fuck are you to be sweatin' me, man
got my reasons for doin' what  do
Percy just stares at him, penetrating
Finally: When  was a kid my father would sit by my bed every night before 'd go to sleep and he'd say to me, Percy, if you don't wake up tomorrow, if it turns out that today was your last day on earth, would you be proud of what you've done in this life
Cuz if you ain't, then you better start gettin' square
Kyle looks at Percy, fear in his eyes, then he turns back to the darkness
and the evil that surrounds them

rolls between dirty fingers
''  - Bob plays with his trusty zippo with one hand and grills up some steaks with the other
He pauses in his cooking every few moments to take a slug from a can of beer
Can't get it down fast enough
Sandra sits at the counter across from him, staring at a prescription bottle tipped in front of her, pills spread around
Bob glances over, sees the devastation in her eyes
He pulls another can of beer from underneath the counter, pops it and places it in front of her
On the house
She looks up at him
Smiles weakly
Takes a sip
Thanks
You hungry
Couldn't eat if my life depended on it
Well  figure just cuz the world's coming to an end, it doesn't mean a man's gotta starve
All  can say is thank heavens they left the gas on
Sandra takes another sip of beer
Considers it
Never much cared for beer
Howard's the beer drinker in the family
The moment the words leave her mouth, the grief hits her again
She gathers up some pills from the counter, tosses them back and downs her beer like there's no tomorrow
This is a battle she's losing
60
Meanwhile in a booth across the diner, Audrey is fiddling with Percy's old radio
Back and forth on the dial
Listening for anything
Nothing but
Up at the front of the diner, Jeep silently helps Michael nail broken table planks across the shattered window
He eyes the strange tatoos running down Michael's arms, the two jagged wounds visible above his shirt line
What did you do
you know, before you came here
Michael considers the question a beat, then: was a soldier, a general, in His army
Well, what changed
What made you leave
was given an order  didn't believe in
(off Jeep's look:) He lost faith
hadn't
Michael drives the last nail into place, securing the window
So what happens to you
after this is over
Michael pauses a beat, as if unsure how much to say, then: Sometimes we have to face the thing we fear the most in order to be free of it
Michael picks up his gun
It's almost time for the next shift
Michael heads for the roof, leaving Jeep to stare after him, deep in thought
: 61
`'  - The faintest glint of sunlight through the dark red dusty haze
new day has forced itself into existence
:   "December 24th - 6:05am" `'  -  - Michael is searching the horizon in front of the diner for movement
His expression focused, determined
On the other side of the roof, Bob keeps watch, struggling to stay awake
The beer taking over
His eyes droop closed
''  - Sandra awakens with a start
Howard
But Howard's not there
And everyone else in the diner is still asleep
The drugs have started to wear off
and her fear is returning
- Sandra splashes water on her face
Stares at herself in the mirror
living wreck
''  -   - Sandra steps out of the bathroom
(a whisper) Sandra
Sandra freezes
Who's there
beat then: Sandra
Sandra spins around
Searching
62
Howard
Is that you
It sure sounded like Howard
Help me
Please
This time, it's clear where the voice is coming from
Sandra turns to face the
desk blocks it
Sandra ever so slowly approaches the door
(from behind the door) Help me
Sandra
Sandra is stricken
What the hell is she going to do
That's when Sandra notices the   above the door
She climbs onto the desk and stretches up until she can see out
' : Howard
Her husband
Ten feet away from the door -
But wait
It gets worse
His skin is covered with horrible black boils
And even worse than that
Howard's boils are breathing
Sandra goes slack with horror
Help me, please
Howard's torn open shirt reveals the covering his body
He writhes in slow, excruciating agony
Howard
Sandra scrambles down off the desk and frantically pushes it away from the door
She's reaching for the dead bolt when Audrey and Kyle appear in the doorway
Mom
Kyle races to restrain Sandra
Let me go
He's alive
63
She struggles against him, throwing a wild elbow that tags Kyle in the face
Down he goes
Sandra is about to open the door when Audrey pounces on her
`'  - The  from the back office awakens the rest of the sleepers
Percy springs up
Charlie is shaking Jeep
''  -  - The    ripping off the plain is all that can be heard
as his head drops down with drunken fatigue
Sleep
Howard nailed to the upside-down cross below
`'  -   - Sandra and Audrey are locked in battle
Sandra slaps Audrey hard
Audrey stumbles over Kyle and hits the floor
Percy appears in the doorway
Now is her last chance
Sandra whips open the back door and that's when the world hits
Howard is there
few feet away
Alive
Sandra races toward him
Just behind her comes Percy
Howard
And that's when the speed    -- -- and the boils covering Howard's body explode -- spraying streams of dark fluid toward Sandra -- -- just at the moment Percy spins around her, shielding her from the spray, which hits him in the back
But he's not stopping
Percy pushes Sandra back into the diner, the door closed behind them
Percy releases Sandra, letting her stumble hysterically into the room
Kyle and Jeep grab her, forcing her to the ground
But she's not fighting anymore
Charlie turns to look at Percy who is still standing with his back to the door, breathing heavily
64
Percy
He takes a step forward, then falls to ground
The entire back side of his body is gone
Burned away
: covering a body
`'  -   - Percy's body lies covered on the table
Bob stares ruefully at his dead friend
broken man
Tears stream down his face
He rolls the Zippo between his fingers
Jeep watches his father from the doorway
We should get back out there
Just gimme another minute with him, okay
Jeep nods, quietly leaves his father at the side of his dead friend
: ' Catatonic
`'  - Michael and Bob are tying Sandra to a chair
Not like it looks like she's capable of going anywhere, but you never know
Across the diner, Charlie eyes Michael cautiously
Michael never goes for more than a few moments without looking up at her
It's not lecherous
More like a protective father making sure his child hasn't strayed too far
In a booth, Audrey watches, red-eyed, as Michael restrains her mother
Then she returns her attention to Percy's radio
Tuning
Trying to find something, anything in the
65
She brings her ear up close
Wait
Is that a
She adjusts the antenna, trying to bring the signal into focus
Hey
Yes
It's a
Hey
You guys,  think  got something here
Everyone drops what they're doing and quickly gathers around the radio
,  , battling has been fierce
The numbers of casualties are unknown but all indications are that they must be unimaginably large
() If you're just joining us, we're getting some of the first bits of good news, if you can call it that, since this apocalypse began just twenty-four ago
human militia has formed on the outskirts of Las Vegas and has begun to engage the enemy
Also down in the Four Corners area, we've been receiving unconfirmed reports of another resistance force gathering in Red Rock National in the northern Mojave Desert area
Red Rock
That can't be more than an hour up the highway from here
Does that mean we can leave
No
We're not going anywhere
What the hell are you talkin' about
This is our chance
66
We can't risk being on the move when the child comes
It's too dangerous
Bob looks over at Charlie, defeated
She shakes her head, anger building
She sweeps some plates off the counter and races for the bathroom
And as we fight this new enemy, may God give us the strength to survive and show mercy for those of us who are already lost
: being lit
- Charlie stands at the sink, cigarette to her lips, water running, stealing a private moment
She takes a deep drag, feels the smoke filling her lungs, defiant
Then she catches a look at herself in the mirror, runs her hand along the curvature of her belly
Tears well up in her eyes, fear and anger overtaking her
She stamps out the cigarette in a fit of frustration
- It's quiet
past sleeping figures to find Charlie, wide-awake, sitting at a booth, lost in thought
(
) Guess it's your turn not to sleep
Charlie looks up to see Jeep sit down across from her
Hey
Jeep sees the strain on her face
You okay
67
You mean besides the fact that just found out that 'm the mother of the Messiah
Jeep smiles, nods
Crazy thing is
didn't want this baby
even went down to the clinic, you know that
(off Jeep's reaction:) remember sitting there in the waiting room, absolutely sure  was doin' the right thing
And that's when the feeling started
Like was falling into the deepest, darkest hole imaginable couldn't breathe,  couldn't speak
kept thinking this must be what death is like
And when finally they called my name,  ran
() For a while after that  tried pretending that it was just cold feet, that  could go back if wanted to, that  could decide to end it like 'd planned
Then 'd start to have that feeling again and  knew  didn't have a choice
Somehow this had already been decided
And it made me hate this thing that's been growing inside me
long beat, as Jeep considers her, then: You shouldn't say things like that, Charlie
It isn't right
You'll get through this
know you will
She turns to him, the bitterness overtaking her: How come you have so much faith in me, Jeep
God knows 've never given you or anybody else a reason to
Or is it that you just can't find any other hard-luck case to follow around
Jeep's face hardens
He gets up
Hurt
Frustrated
68
You know, you're not the only who's suffered, okay
Let me know when you stop feeling sorry for yourself
And with that, Jeep walks away, leaving Charlie to stare after him, disturbed and surprised by his response
: ''  -  - Sand and wind
The   is sinking
Kyle and Audrey are bundled together on the roof, keeping watch
Kyle is showing her how to hold the MP5
Then you just flip this -- Audrey flips the safety
Yeah,  got it
All the way down
Two clicks
She points the gun out into the haze like she's been holding one all her life
Off Kyle's surprised look: Dated this guy last summer marine
Had a thing for guns
Parents hated him
bet they did
After a moment, Audrey switches the safety back on
Hands the gun over to Kyle
Audrey stares into the red nothingness surrounding them
Her expression growing distant
She seems to have aged years overnight
My parents hate everything  do
That's why we were moving
Yeah
69
They thought a more "wholesome" environment would help me "change my ways
" So fucked up
Only reason they care at all is cuz they don't want to be embarrassed in front of their friends at the country club
Kyle considers her thoughtfully
The only time my old man ever paid attention to me was when  was doing somethin' bad
So you know what  did
What
got really good at being bad
She smiles at this confession
Can obviously relate
He wipes a tear from her cheek
She leans in
Kisses him
Passionately
Desperately
His hands trace over her body
She claws at him
Her passion growing out of control
She's practically devouring him
Kyle can barely keep up
It's like something else beyond sensual need has taken over
She moves down his chest
Further
Kyle leans his head back
Further
Just then the   that illuminate the roof sign come to life
The young couple stops to look up at the brilliant red word "Paradise" illuminated above them
Down below, the gas pumps
The station's flicker on
`'  - All at once the entire diner
The jukebox  , filling the room with Merle Haggard's "'m a Lonesome Fugitive"
Bob's  glows with bright rolling
The electric fan spins on above the grill
70
Jeep and Michael move to look through the slats at the window
Charlie is giving Sandra some water through a straw
Bob wanders in, squinting at the sudden presence of light
We back in business
don't think so
''  -  - The truck stop is lit up like a Christmas tree
If you didn't know better, you might mistake the place for business as usual
Kyle and Audrey stand on the roof, taking in the dramatic change
Is it over
don't know
appear on the highway
(raising his gun) You better get downstairs
No,  can handle it
Kyle stares at Audrey's beautiful, determined face
Then he pulls out his silver 45
(handing her the gun) Just in case
The headlights become a   careening wildly off the highway to stop at the pumps
Get ready
They aim their weapons at the vehicle
well dressed  in his mid-thirties jumps out of the car
He looks around nervously, scared
Then, seeing that the coast is clear, he offers a calming wave to his  and who wait anxiously for him inside the car
71
He races around to the gas pump
(lowering his gun) Wait a minute
Kyle, are they
distant  from behind
Kyle and Audrey spin to look out over the back side of the diner
are swarming in fast
Kyle looks urgently back at the family
The father lifts the pump
Flips the lever
It's a trap
They saw them coming and turned on the lights
It's a fucking trap
Kyle and Audrey wave their arms frantically at the family
Hey
Get back in your car
It's a trap
But down below, the man can only hear the sound of as he pumps the gas
Kyle fires his gun in the air
At the sound of gunfire, the man looks quickly up to the roof
His family heard it too and they start to The man can only see silhouettes in this light, but he's not waiting around to see if it's friend or foe
Audrey watches in horror as the dark shapes reach the diner
They're not gonna make it
The father dashes to the driver's side
He throws open the door
But he's too late
He looks over his shoulder just in time to see a
His   the car windows
Kyle raises his MP5 to fire upon the dark shapes that surround the vehicle like swarming insects
The wife and boy scream hysterically as they are torn from the vehicle by skeletal hands
72
(pushing his barrel down) Wait
You'll hit them too
So Kyle makes a desperately courageous play
He leaps onto the roof's sloped overhang -- sliding fast -- he drops to the ground in front of the diner
Kyle
Kyle charges the dark mob
Creatures peel away from the woman and boy to confront Kyle head-on
He lets loose with a rain of bullets, eviscerating everything that comes at him
''  - The group gathered at the window sees Kyle racing out toward the pumps
Jesus Christ, what the hell is that boy doin'
We have to get `im back in here
Bob springs into action
Pushes the booth away from the front door
The sound of a gun
Bob looks over to see Michael pointing a gun at his head
Don't
You open that door and we could all be dead
''  - The Possessed move in from all sides, but Kyle is remarkably agile, dropping one after another in a stunning display
He closes in on the family, blasting back the creatures huddled around them
He finds the   curled up with his hands protectively covering his face
Kyle swoops down and gathers the boy into his arms
73
got you
Kyle moves on to the mother
But something odd is happening
The creatures have stopped coming at him
In fact, they're just standing there watching him
Waiting
Kyle freezes
as he senses something terribly wrong
(
) Mister
Kyle looks over at the boy in his arms stare back at him
() Fooled ya
'
Kyle drops to his knees
Up on the roof, Audrey watches helplessly as Kyle falls
Kyle
''  - Bob kicks over a table in disgust
Damn it all to hell
Oh, no
Audrey
Out the window they see Audrey drop down from the roof and run towards Kyle
''  - The young boy stands over Kyle, silently watching the life drain from his body
The boy looks up to see Audrey approaching fast
Tears suddenly appear in his eyes
He opens his arms pleadingly to her
74
'm sorry
didn't mean to
Fuck you
Audrey raises the 45 and
She keeps pulling the trigger
Nothing
The boy's tears stop instantly
He looks at her with an eerie calm for someone so young
You're gonna die now
The boy moves toward Audrey, stepping over Kyle's body
Audrey backs away
She looks toward the entrance to the diner
Blocked by advancing creatures
They're everywhere
She's trapped
She notices the open door to the
And so she
Audrey dives into the car as the throng of creatures rapidly closes in
She hammers the auto door lock
She moves to the center of the car as gruesome faces press against the windows
nightmare come to life
''  - Panic
Charlie rushes to Michael's side
Do you have no heart
She's just a kid
But he's immovable
You can't let her die
(grabbing a gun from the ) swear if you don't do something, will
Charlie  the gun, moves toward the door
Wait
75
Charlie looks back at him, defiant
No one breathes
Then: (raising his guns) Open the door
Bob springs into action, clearing the door and flipping the dead bolt
The door is opened and Michael charges passed Charlie and out into hell
''  - With stunning calm, Michael marches straight for the pumps
, Audrey screams as the windows begin to
She's running out of time
Michael grabs a gas pump, flips the lever and points it at the minivan
What's he up to
The creatures covering the car turn to look at Michael as if they've just now noticed him
And that's when he starts spraying gas at them
But wait, there's more to this trick
Up comes Michael's Glock in his other hand and
The spray of gas  into a
The  is engulfed in flames
Creatures tear away from the car like fiery comets through the night
The windows , showering Audrey with tiny shards of glass
Michael drops the gas pump
He reaches through a fire rimmed broken car window and unlocks the door
Audrey looks up to see Michael's expressionless face Come with me
Meanwhile, fire is spreading quickly under the car
Michael pulls Audrey from the flaming vehicle
Run
76
And together they run toward the open diner door
''  - Everyone's eyes go wide at the insanity they're witnessing
Audrey is the first one in
Michael is almost there
But the fire is faster, Michael
(pulling Charlie away from the door) Get back
, Michael marches confidently into the diner
Jeep slams the door  just as the Everyone hits the deck as the covering the windows like spindly fingers reaching for prey
Michael's clothes are a smoky, smoldering mess
Jeep and Bob rush to pat him down
Audrey's coughing from the smoke
'll get some water
Charlie dashes behind the counter to the sink
She fills up a pitcher of water
She turns away from the sink with the filled pitcher
And
The   with the lifeless white eyes stands before her wielding an  '
The pitcher shatters  on the floor
The boy swings the knife at her, slicing open the waitress outfit covering her pregnant belly
Charlie tumbles back to the ground behind the counter
She frantically pushes herself away from the approaching boy
77
But she doesn't have far to go before she'll run out of room to maneuver
'mon, don't be scared
just wanna play with your baby
That's it
She's backed against the end of the counter
The boy raises the knife to strike
Charlie grabs a baking pan off a shelf
Swings it out in front of her body like a shield, as the
The knife hits the pan hard and stops
But the boy's hands don't
They slip off the handle and run right down the blade
The knife  to the ground
The boy instinctively raises his hands to strike again, but there's no knife
Charlie watches in horror as the boy calmly realizes that his Blood sprays from the stumps
Charlie pulls her legs in close then rockets them out at the boy's chest
He's catapulted away from her
Michael leaps over the counter, landing in front of Charlie, guns ready for action
But the boy is gone
Are you hurt
Charlie shakes her head no
Where is he
That's when the electricity goes out once again, ' He's still in here
fan out across the diner
under chairs
Under tables
' Where the fuck is he
Everybody spins to track the location of the sound
78
As soon as they move in one direction, the  is heard in another
Jeep's He's bleeding
, Jeep raises his What the fuck
'
Bob flails around trying to pull the boy's small, but deadly strong arms away from his neck
Dad
Jeep can't get a clear shot
Bob's gasping for air
Michael grabs the boy and fiercely rips him off of Bob's back
He swings the boy around like a living shot put
Get ready
Jeep and Bob whip up their guns as Michael throws the wicked creature into the air
Sandra's vacant face flickers in the light as the fill the diner
And then in moments
All is
, Audrey helps Charlie to her feet
She Doubles over, clutching her stomach
Oh, no
Michael lowers his flashlight
runs down Charlie's legs
: 79
`'  - Inky darkness
flickering light emanates from within the diner
:   "December 25th - 3:33am" The sound of ' , carries us to: ''  - Charlie, drenched in sweat is writhing on the ground with Michael holding down her arms and Audrey kneeling between her legs
Pots of steaming water surround them
What am  supposed to do
Just `cause 'm a girl doesn't mean automatically know how to do this
Just do as  say
Yeah, but, how do you know how to do this
''  -  - Bob and Jeep keep watch
The   in the distance seem to be growing larger -- closer
Charlie's  rises up from below
What a way to bring a child into the world
(looks over at Jeep) She ever tell you his name
She's never said
just assumed it was Joe Danvers
You know how she's always had a thing for bad boys
Bob hears the spite in Jeep's voice
80
Jeep, sooner or later she'll realize you're the best thing that's ever happened to her
thought you said  should move on
Can't a father be wrong sometimes
Jeep considers Bob with a smile, then comes the sound
, ,    rising up off the plain, as if emanating from the largest  ever constructed
What was that
The   dot the landscape now with untold numbers
''  - Michael reacts to the sound
An urgency comes over him
Audrey arrives with more steaming water
What is that
He's coming
We have to hurry
Who's coming
Whaddya mean hurry
This isn't something you can exactly hurry, is it
Charlie,  need you to push need you to push as hard as you can
Michael, who's coming
Charlie pushes, tears streaming down her face, delirious with pain
It's a gruesome, bloody affair
It's getting close
We're almost there
81
''  -  - Jeep and Bob watch helplessly as the    has closed within a hundred yards of the diner
Their ranks stretch back seemingly without end into the darkness
We're not gonna make it outta here, are we
Bob looks at his son
The agony stretched across his face
'm sorry Jeep
This shouldn't be happening to you
Jeep rests a comforting hand on his father's shoulder
Bob pulls his son close and hugs him with all his might, tears filling his eyes
`'  - Amidst the dirt and darkness, Charlie lets out a final agonizing
and then comes a '
Audrey, eyes wide, holds up the
Stunned
Elated
Oh my god
we did it
Charlie, you did it
Audrey places the child in Charlie's arms
She stares at the baby, holding it at a distance, unsure of whether to embrace it or be terrified by it
commitment she's not yet ready to make, even at this late hour
() It's okay
The baby's okay
Charlie looks to Audrey, tears streaming down her face
don't
Audrey looks to Michael, unsure
Take him
Give her a minute
Audrey nods, takes the baby back from Charlie, tries to soothe him by pacing around the diner
82
It's okay
It's okay
Shhh
Another
Menacing
Closer
Audrey   reacts, crosses to the counter, turns on the radio, trying   to drown out the sound of the approaching menace
Out of the   , the haunting sounds of   singing fills the room
The quiet before the storm
Michael helps Charlie quickly clean herself up
She stares at him, a burning spite in her eyes
So are we safe now
Is it over
No
Killing the child would have ended the war before it had begun
Now, at least, he will have a chance to grow up, a chance to lead the world out of darkness
Those words provide her little comfort
And what happens until then
You'll need to teach him how
Charlie shakes her head, this is all too much
What makes you think  can do that
What makes you think  want to do that
If he's so important, why don't you take him
Each of us has a burden
This one is yours and yours alone
Maybe someday you'll understand what that means
Off Charlie's look, we move across the diner where Audrey approaches her mother, kneels down in front of her
Despite how much her mother pisses her off, it breaks her heart to see her in such a demoralized state
Mama
Can you hear me
(holds up the baby) We did it
The baby's alive
() 83
(cont'd) () Mama
If Sandra hears her daughter, it doesn't show in her face
Tears well up in Audrey's eyes as she moves away from her mother
But we  here and
Sandra's hands are loosening the bonds
from where the rope's cut through her skin
''  - the dark shapes as the ' reverberate up and down the ranks
They begin to look about frantically, agitated by the sound
Some even begin to back away from the diner
: - Off in the distance, the diner is but a dim flickering light above the plain
It could almost be mistaken for a stable in a desert town a long time ago
burn bright and low in the black sky
All around us the   are cowering from sound of the   whose wails seem to grow even  the further away from the diner we get
In the darkness below we see the lights of the legions of creatures dot the landscape and at the center of it all, the truck stop
The sound of
' ''  - Jeep and Bob enter the diner to see Michael helping Charlie to her feet, while Audrey continues to pace, the bundle of bloody blankets cradled in her arms
Something's happening
They're moving away
84
The Possessed can't come near the child, so He sent someone that can
Someone like me
Who
Gabriel
My lieutenant
He's come to do what  wouldn't
as the realization hits him
Your orders
Michael looks at Jeep
You were the one who was supposed to kill the baby
That was the order you didn't obey
Michael nods grimly
Charlie looks urgently at Michael
What's he talking about
The baby
Michael, what the hell's he talking about
There was never meant to be a Second Coming
But we've just changed that
The child lives
The future is unwritten
There's still hope
Charlie, shaken by this revelation, reaches out to Audrey
Audrey
Audrey moves to hand over the baby to Charlie
' '
Sandra backs away from them, moving toward the front door
Hers is the face of madness
85
Stay away from me
Don't come any closer
Mom
Don't do it, lady
You heard what he said
They just want the baby
Maybe if we just give it to them, then they'll let us go
Michael cocks his gun
Points it at Sandra
, , '
Charlie squares off with Sandra, panic in her eyes
Give him to me
Why
You never wanted him in the first place
Charlie stares at her in horror, the truth of those words rattling her to the very core
No
Sandra is almost to the front door
It's just one baby
Just one
brilliant   pours into the diner
Sandra is blinded
She raises a hand to block the light
And that's when Michael fires
Sandra staggers back, blood dripping from the hole in her forehead, and
Charlie screams and the
And everything suddenly goes very
86
Michael fires again
Blowing Sandra's body back through the doorway
Jeep watches the baby sail  through the air
The time for Jeep to act is now
Jeep  for the baby
catching the bundle of rags mere inches from the ground
And then he looks up to see
The dark     approaching from out of the spectral light
Jeep's eyes grow wide as the   steps into the diner
But this looks like no angel we've seen before
This is a creature built for war
Rough hewn, battle scarred
His body armor making him appear disturbingly insect like
His wings are not feathery or gentle
Rather they are hard, mechanical, an organic machine
The angel's wings retract with clockwork-like precision
And now that we see the his face clearly, we notice his striking resemblance to Michael
We might even mistake them for brothers
His name is
Gabriel raises a massive, ferocious, strangely mechanical looking  in his powerful hands
And the world returns to   as Gabriel brings the mace arcing down at Jeep
Jeep rolls
The weapon just misses him, hitting the floor in a spray of sparks, literally
Gabriel brings the mace up again
Jeep won't be so lucky twice
(
) Sonuvabitch
Bob charges at the creature, sub-machine gun blazing
Gabriel reacts by instantly    and launching himself into the air
The bullets clawing up the wall behind him
But Bob's heroic move has given Jeep time to get up and run with the baby for the back of the diner
He thrusts the child into Charlie's hands
And without even thinking, she pulls the child protectively to her chest
87
Gabriel drops down in front of Bob, whipping his wings around like a deadly,
Bob stops firing, a look of surprise stretches over his face
His gun falling from his hands
Blood begins to pour out of the slice across his belly
No
With a sweep of his hand, Gabriel sends Bob flying across the diner where he crashes down behind the counter near the stove
Michael  '  before the boy can rush back into the fray
No, Jeep
You must protect the child now
Me
What about you
My path ends here
You are the true protector
You always have been
Jeep shakes his head, panic setting in
But  don't know what to do
Find the Prophets
Learn to read the instructions
Michael lets go of Jeep's hand and turns away to face Gabriel, leaving Jeep to contemplate those final words
Prophets
What Prophets
What instructions
And that's when Jeep opens his hand to find the  to Michael's Police Cruiser
Jeep looks up from the keys to see Charlie, Audrey and the baby
The responsibility crashing in on him
Then he closes his hand around the keys, determination building
'mon
88
Charlie looks past Jeep to see Michael returning to the fray
Wait
We can't leave him
We have no choice
We have to get to Red Rock
He pulls Charlie past the counter toward the back office
Jeep stops when he sees his father's broken body lying on the ground by the stove in a pool of his own blood
Bob's half open eyes focus on his son
In his outstretched hand is that goddamn
and next to that, a leading to the stove
Jeep is terrified
Dad
Jeep tries to help him up
Leave me, Jeep
My place is here, remember
But Dad
Bob smiles weakly at his son and says simply: Run
And so Jeep, fighting back tears, does what his father says
''  -   - Audrey and Jeep push the desk away from the door
Charlie opens it
Sand swirls in around her
And Jeep leads the trio out the door
`'  - Michael and Gabriel square off in the diner, not like enemies, but like brothers on opposite sides of a terrible family conflict
89
knew he'd send you, Gabriel
You were always so eager to please Him
Unlike you
the rebellious son
(noticing Michael's scars) Pity about your wings
They would have helped you now
To not feel their burden
is a dream
You think you can defy Him and not pay the price
The child lives
What happens to me doesn't matter now
Yours is a fool's sacrifice
You can help them sneak out the back door, but they won't escape
() And neither will you, brother
Michael slowly approaches Gabriel
() 'm not running anymore
Gabriel hesitates, doubt clouding his face
This was not what he was expecting
() Join with me
You don't need do this
There's another way
beat, then Gabriel's expression hardens
There is no other way
He pulls back from Michael, raising the mace --
-- as if it wasn't bad-ass enough
And the fight begins
90
It's mace against machine gun and strangely enough, it seems under Gabriel's deft control, the mace is the vastly superior weapon
With the aid of his wings, Gabriel moves with staggering speed, defying gravity to avoid the rain of bullets
The place is getting absolutely shot to hell
Michael leaps from table top to table top as Gabriel brings the mace brutally down -- splintering everything it touches
Michael leaps onto the last unbroken table top -- spins to fire
Gabriel pushes into the air, jabbing a spike straight into the barrel of Michael's MP5
The gun explodes in Michael's hands, sending him rocketing backwards where he lands on the counter
Gabriel swoops in fast
Michael kicks him in the chest, sending him fluttering back
Michael thrusts himself to his feet
Gabriel recovers, jabs again
Michael grabs a hold of Bob's ceiling mounted  for support and lifts his body just above the deadly spike
Michael kicks Gabriel in the head, momentarily stunning him
Michael dives at Gabriel, landing an awesome flurry of punches
Gabriel is rattled back by the assault
He clumsily lifts his mace and thrusts with it
Michael narrowly evades the razor point, which drives into a wall
Michael smashes down on Gabriel's wrist,  the bones
swift kick to the chest and Gabriel is thrust crashing back, losing his grip on the weapon
Michael takes a running leap onto Gabriel's back
Gabriel launches wildly into the air, trying to throw Michael off
They hit the ceiling, but Michael hangs on
Choking the life out of Gabriel
''  - Audrey and Jeep help Charlie quickly move around the side of the diner where the cruiser is parked
They are buffeted by winds and sand
Jeep puts Charlie and the baby into the front passenger seat while Audrey hustles in back

Jeep rounds to the driver's side
Hops in
- Jeep frantically tries to get the right key into the ignition
It's in
Jeep turns the key but the
Panic
Come on, Jeep

Jeep gives it some gas, but the '
The light catches it, revealing the disfigured face and beard of a , his oversized belly gruesomely distended
Charlie screams
Fuck
Jeep pumps the gas and the
The creature's about to punch a fist through the glass (throwing the car in ) Hang on
Jeep floors it, causing the cruiser to rocket backwards toward the highway
Jeep pulls the wheel hard and the cruiser whips around a full 180 onto the road
Jeep throws it in drive just as the   rises from the pavement
Pedal to the metal
92
The creature doesn't have a chance as the cruiser  into him
as a flash of red and white is sent sailing over the car and tumbling down onto the road behind them in a cloud of dust
Jeep clenches the wheel, pedal to the floor
Okay, we need to figure out our weapon situation
Hopefully Michael didn't take everything out of the car
Jeep places his Glock on the dash
He sees that he's got a police issue shotgun in the front seat rack
Charlie searches under her seat
Pulls out a
Is this what  think it is
Yes
Now just put it down
Slowly
Charlie places it onto the seat
Audrey fishes around in the backseat
(holding up each item) Okay, all  got is a flare gun thing
Looks like we got a box of flares to go with it
Okay
Okay
Handgun
Shotgun a flare gun
And a grenade
Alright
(hands Charlie the Glock) Load this
() Audrey, can you figure out how to load that flare gun without killing us all
can try
Try real hard, okay
Audrey anxiously sets about loading the flare gun
93
`'  - Gabriel flies into a wall in an attempt to crush Michael
He fails that but succeeds in leaving a massive dent
Gabriel runs/flies for the opposite wall
This one doesn't hold and the two enemies crash through it into the bathroom
Unbelievably Michael is still holding on
Gabriel is up
He thrusts himself back into the bathroom mirror
It shatters painfully behind Michael
Gabriel rages out of the bathroom and into the diner
Michael continues to ride him like a wild bull
Gabriel slams Michael into a wall once more
It's a brutal struggle
Gabriel spots his mace sticking out of the wall within arms reach
He grabs it, holding it futilely in front of him
From this angle he'd never be able to hit Michael with it
Gabriel's strength is giving way
Michael is winning
Gabriel lets out a tremendous  and plunges one of the mace's long spikes into his own stomach
Michael's eyes go wide with surprise, his grip loosens
Gabriel has run them both through
Gabriel rips the mace from his body and stumbles forward
Blood pours from a huge hole in Michael's chest
Right through his heart
Gabriel looks down at the hole in his own belly
Not nearly as bad as Michael's
Apparently there's not a lot of blood left in this guy
Michael falls to his knees
Weakening
Gabriel looms over Michael
Michael looks up at him, blood leaking from his mouth
You always wanted to live like one of them
Now you'll know how it feels to die like one of them
Gabriel raises the mighty mace above his head
Michael closes his eyes
Submitting
The mace comes swinging down

Nothing is visible beyond the windows

Jeep turns on the windshield wipers
Hits the brights
Driving blind

Go faster

Charlie's desperately trying to soothe her  baby
as  start crawling in
Oh, no

Something is happening to his skin
The is beginning - itself and
-  - Charlie is struggling to close the air vents to stop the inflow of  insects
It's not working
She looks to Jeep in desperation, but something more frightening catches her attention
The   is beginning to appear on Jeep's arm, snaking its way up from his wrists like
Jeep, your arm
Jeep sees it, eyes go wide
What is it
beat, as Jeep remembers Michael's parting words
95
The instructions
`'  - Gabriel watches as the last of the writing  from Michael's body when he hears a faint  sound from somewhere in the diner
Gabriel moves gracefully through the destroyed diner, toward the source of the
He steps behind the counter and finds Bob lying in a massive pool of blood
It takes the creature a moment to realize that the sound is coming from Bob's
Bob is focusing every last ounce of life in his body to lighting that lighter
Bob looks at Gabriel
Sorry
We're closed
And with one last brush of his thumb, Bob's trusty Gabriel's eyes go wide as the    in front of the stove's broken gas line
Gabriel spins and runs like hell as the gas explodes
-  - The   rocks the slow moving vehicle
In the rearview mirror, Jeep sees the in the sky behind them
It's eerily magnificent
The swarm, it's fading
Jeep looks back to the road as, sure enough, the suddenly dissipates all around them, revealing a of the highway ahead
Jeep knows at what price this good fortune has come

Thank you
'    "" Oh, shit
- The cruiser  through the burning "Paradise" sign, smashing it into fiery pieces
The cruiser charges on down the endless highway, burning bits of sign swirling in its wake
-  - From the back seat, Audrey watches the fire recede into the distance
can't believe it
Is it really over
Up front Jeep stares out at the dark road ahead
No
It's just starting
''  - Burning wreckage everywhere
until we settle on the - stuck firmly in the ground
Flames ring the handle
- The cruiser blazes down the highway
-  - Charlie cradles the baby, apprehensive
The baby looks up at her, smiles
She can't help but smile back at him
Jeep eyes her
97
Better not hold him too long
Might get attached
Charlie looks over, feels his lingering anger
Look, 'm sorry for what  said to you earlier, `bout you following me around
didn't mean it
Nothin' to be sorry about
It's true
did follow you around
At least now  know there was a good reason
Charlie's reacts, a bit stung
Jeep tries to hide his pleasure that the tables have turned at least a little
Charlie is about to respond when Audrey leans in from the back seat
We're here
She points ahead to a beaten up road sign that says: "Now Entering Red Rock National Park, Next Rest Stop 30 " Okay, all we gotta do is -- The roof buckles above them
The windows
- ' ,
-  - Jeep, Charlie and Audrey slip frantically down in their seats as the roof presses down at them
The windows
Jeep grabs the Glock and fires wildly up at the roof
98
-  - Gabriel takes a direct hit in the thigh, causing him to slide off the roof and onto the trunk where he grabs a hold of the rear window frame for support
-  - With tremendous strength, Gabriel pulls his upper body through the broken back window toward Audrey
Jeep
Jeep swings the gun around
Duck
Gabriel takes one in the shoulder, but it doesn't slow him down
Audrey, the flare gun
Audrey desperately tries to load a flare while avoiding Gabriel's grasp
Jeep can't get off another shot without the risk of hitting Audrey
Gabriel is almost entirely in the car now
Audrey swings the flare gun toward Gabriel, but he knocks her hand aside just as she pulls the trigger and the flare goes off
Jeep ducks
The
The flare through the cabin, lighting it up like the Fourth of July
Gabriel lunges for Charlie just as the flare bounces off the windshield -
- and nails him right in the face, And that gives Jeep the chance to swing around and
Gabriel is blown back partially through the rear window
He holds onto the car with an iron grip
Starts to pull himself back in
Nothing slows this guy down
Jeep pulls the trigger again and
No bullets
Audrey frantically reloads the flare gun
Brings it up to fire, but he's too fast
Gabriel knocks her into the side of the car with a sweep of his hand
She's out cold
99
Now he's clawing his way unobstructed toward Charlie again
Jeep knows there's only one thing to do
Get down on the floor
Charlie pushes herself and the baby down on the floor in front of the passenger seat
Jeep
The speedometer leaps ahead
70
80
90
Gabriel's now completely in the car
They're helpless
Gabriel lunges over the passenger seat, grasping for Charlie, his ferocious hand only inches from her and the baby, when
(
) Get off her, you fucking asshole
Audrey leaps onto Gabriel, pulling him away from Charlie just in time
He flails wildly about but this young girl rides him like one helluva a cowboy

Do it, Jeep
Do it now
, The intertwined bodies of Gabriel and Audrey hit the road with a sickening crunch and
- The Cruiser spins out of control, swerving off the road and careening into a large rock formation
This ride is over
- Jeep's side of the car is crushed
Blood is running down his forehead
Charlie crawls up from the floor
'mon, Jeep
100
He tries to focus on her
Jeep
She kicks open her door and begins pulling him out
The baby
Alive
And what about
Nothing could have survived that
() Audrey
She saved us, Jeep
Audrey saved us
Now c'mon, we gotta go
Charlie, the baby bundled in her hands, leads Jeep away from the demolished Cruiser
- - Jeep and Charlie, battered and bruised, struggle to make the long climb up the ridge
Charlie looks up
completely fill the pre-dawn sky
Breathtaking
How can this happen
What
How can this happen in a world so beautiful
Jeep follows her gaze to the sky
Endless stars
Confounding
Jeep shifts his eyes to the     just ahead
101
'mon, we're almost there
They are only a few steps from the     when -- Charlie screams
Jeep pushes her and the baby out of the way just as Gabriel comes down hard in front of them, kicking up a cloud of dust
Gabriel's mechanical wings haltingly retract
The crash has done some serious damage
Much of his skin has burned away
Chunks of his armor and flesh are missing as well, including a large part of his head, revealing that under his human visage is a
Gabriel charges at Jeep fast
Jeep whips up his Glock,
Gabriel takes the bullet, then slaps the gun out of Jeep's hand
Jeep throws a wild punch, connects with Gabriel's chin, rocking him back
More annoyed than surprised, Gabriel knocks Jeep savagely to the ground
Jeep struggles quickly to his feet, comes right back at Gabriel swinging
But Gabriel simply knocks him to the dirt again
Jeep slowly gets up once more, bleeding, hurt
Raises his fists
This kid will simply not give up
Jeep moves in again, swinging hard, but Gabriel blocks it, shoots out a hand and grabs Jeep by throat, lifting him clear off the ground
So brave
So pointless
You should have worried more about saving yourself
Jeep's feet dangle
His eyes bulge out
He claws at Gabriel's iron-fast grip, but there's no hope
Charlie watches in horror
Stop
Please
Don't kill him
But Gabriel is doing just that
Jeep is rapidly losing consciousness
The battle is lost
Go to sleep
Jeep's eyes flutter
He's almost gone
102
Stop it
'
This gets Gabriel's attention
Charlie climbs to her feet, holding the bloody bundle out to him
don't want this responsibility
Tears run down her face
She's dead fucking serious
Gabriel lets go of Jeep
He falls to the ground, gasping desperately for air
Charlie, no
Gabriel takes the bundle from Charlie, turning away from her
"And as the child's cries are extinguished, an eternal darkness at last descended upon the world
" He peels the cloth back, revealing
He spins around to face Charlie
She's holding the pin
The creature is gone at last
The sound of a
Charlie picks the child up out of the brush
She helps Jeep to his feet and together they slowly make their way to the top of the ridge
- Jeep and Charlie stand overlooking the desert valley below
, reacting to what they see
Charlie takes Jeep's hand in hers
103
We made it
Yep, we sure did
And now we see it too: - Vast
Barren
No signs of life
No resistance force
No nothing
Taking it in
Breathing hard
'm sure they're just over the next ridge
He glances at Charlie
Worry in her eyes
What if we're on our own now
Don't be afraid
We'll be okay
() Believe me
At those words, Charlie looks deep into Jeep's eyes
Sees a confidence in them she's never seen before
And she leans in and kisses him
Tender
When they part, Jeep stares back at her with surprise
Then the surprise melts into a smile
And they descend the ridge
out of sight, leaving us with a view once again of -- - rises behind the distant mountains
The unbearable cold will soon become an unbearable heat
And we're back where we started
'
Solemn
Weary
Determined

' '
' Someday when my son is older, will tell him about the time of his birth when all the world was covered in a great darkness
: -  -  - Jeep is at the wheel
He looks aged, scarred from the experience
His exposed arms are completely covered with the The Instructions
The boy he once was is gone at last and the warrior protector has replaced him
' And how just at the moment when everything seemed lost
Charlie sits across from him, the baby cradled in her arms
It's strange, but you might actually mistake them for a happy family
Of course you'll have to ignore the in the back seat
'  (') a mighty warrior fell in order to save me
Jeep glances over at Charlie and the baby
He smiles at the image of maternal bliss
'  (') And a boy faced his fear and rose up to save us all
The sun shines through the car windows, filling our eyes with its fiery light
