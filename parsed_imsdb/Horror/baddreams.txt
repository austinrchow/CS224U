-                                          1 serene landscape, mist collecting as the red ball of a sun dips behind the mountains
In the middle of a field stands a bare-chested man facing the sunset
He is , forty-ish, greying but handsome, and very fit
His hands are outstretched as if embracing an invisible entity
He seems filled with some sort of transcendental power
Now, an air of fulfillment and resolve settles over him
He turns and walks away from us and reveals-- 2
-   -                              2 Once the home of Victorian Gentry, a few seasons of amateur repair work have not compensated for decades of neglect
But now as Harris walks towards it, the fading daylight and long shadows turn it into a fantasy castle
faintly from within; it's "In--Gadda-Da-Vida" by Iron Butterfly
If the music didn't place the era for us, the battered parked outside the house does; it's covered with flower paintings, slogans, and the ubiquitous peace sign
As Harris approaches the house, a dozen or so rush to greet him and embrace him
Extending his arms out to enclose them all, he goes inside

-                                          3 This was probably a stately parlor in its day
There is a funky assembly of odd handmade furniture
There are muslin curtains on the windows, crude paintings, and quilts covering ripped chairs and couches
Despite the squalor, there is a neatness to the place
Now, the  begins to through the room and down the hallways lined with fading wallpaper

Cynthia, come on, honey, we need you
Cynthia, come out, come out wherever you are

:             (') Hey, mellow out, we got ten minutes,  like, checked the almanac, okay
Ready or not, here we come
All these comments are made in relaxed and good natured tones
Finally the    to a little storage alcove beneath the servant's stairway
reaches in and opens the door, and inside we  cartons, antique toys
and then , a pretty 13 year old girl who wears funky clothing and a haunted, nervous expression
(') There you are, you naughty girl
You almost made us lose the sunset
Come on, honey, time's wasting
She shrinks back from the  that are pulling her up and out, but they prevail, and she's up and on unsteady feet
The  stays with her as she's led back down the hallway
(faintly) No, please

Can't  just wait for you

Easy, Cyn, easy
You don't want to do this, that's okay
right, Harris
The  stop as everyone awaits an answer across the common room, to the end we haven't seen yet
In the center of the room is a big cistern or font
As we watch, Harris has just  someone in it
The person steps out, laughing, sloshing in amber liquid
Standing around are other people, some already dripping wet, others awaiting their turns
Some are clothed and wet, others in varying degrees of undress
It all seems slightly off, slightly eerie, despite their smiles and cheer
Harris splashes himself with the amber liquid from the tub, pushes his hair back

Here at Unity House, some things have to be done
(slight smile) in Unity
This is one of them
He   to the , within reach of Cynthia, Victor and the others
Smiles again
It's the kind of a smile that inspires trust
(') Cynthia, do you trust me
She nods immediately

She shakes her head

The people around Cynthia begin to   the tub
Some remove their clothing; others get in clothes and all
Toddlers and infants are held by their parents and playfully splashed
(') Then  say to you now
to all of you now
that this will be the Ultimate Joining
of man and woman
parent and child
humanity and Godhead
He looks at Victor, who reluctantly lets Cynthia's hand go, gets in
Now only Cynthia remains
(') Cynthia
Come
There is no shame in this
No crime
No sin
Just the final break with the old world
As night falls, we start a new day
a day of Unity
(a command, but warm) Come to me
my lovechild

Moving like a sleepwalker, she steps into the tub, wades forward
Then she stops, looks down at the fluid lapping at her jeans
runs her hand through it
Her eyes widen

Even the battered  van looks good in this setting
It's beautiful

She's in a leotard and leg warmers, and there's real color in her face for the first time

: Drop down to first gear, honey
It's Miller time
She fumbles on her tray for the cup marked "Weston," hands the pills to Cynthia along with a cup of juice
What are these
Vitamins
Beauty secrets from the orient
Look what they've done for me
Cynthia laughs, takes the pills
Hettie moves over to Ralph, who's just finished doing bench presses
Ralph, you in a cooperative mood, or do  have to tie you up again
Promises, promises
He takes the pills she gives him, smiles
She just looks at him, taps his mouth
Open
Of course the pills are still under his tongue
Hettie gives him a shot in the solar plexus and he
Hettie hands him the juice

Ralph moves over to Cynthia
She's crazy about me

You're making this up

He just grins
She slips down to the floor, does some stretching exercises
(') Sounds like a complicated world
How do you handle it
Well, whenever it gets to be too much,  just let all of the negative stuff out of my body
You mean with meditation, yoga, what
Nah
just make a little hole and let it all escape
He pulls open his shirt
On his chest and arms are dozens of scars in neat little rows
Cynthia swallows, stunned
Nonplussed, Ralph buttons back up
(') Uh-uh, here comes the assistant Ayatollah
See ya
As Ralph exits, Cynthia looks around, puzzled
"Ay-a-toll-ah
" Then she sees Alan
Buy you some lunch
Sure
() 26
: (3) He starts to help her up
She pushes him off gets up with a theatrical hop
'm impressed
They walk out of the therapy room
Impressed enough to call me a cab
'm not sure  follow you
've been talking to Ralph
He told me about his
personal therapy program
(as Alan winces) And 've been watching the others
Dr
Goldman, they belong here
don't

The two women patients wave at Cynthia, who smiles
(as they walk) Please, call me Alan
Doctor Goldman is my father
(thinking) and my grandfather
think my first baby toy was a stethoscope-- You're changing the subject
(trying it out) --Alan
'm feeling stronger
'm getting used to things like esses and MCDs
want to leave
(carefully) Your parents died when you were a child
We haven't been able to locate any relatives
He stops at the elevator doors, hits the button
() 27
: (') Where would you go
guess 'd just look up some of the old hands from Unity House
crash with them for a while
(thinking) do people still say "crash"--
Cynthia
(gently) There aren't any old hands left
The fire that injured you
It took everyone also with it
They're all gone
Cynthia reacts as if struck
has to loan against the wall to catch her breath
knew there were deaths
but
everybody
'm afraid so
Look, Cynthia
'm not saying this to upset you, but the sooner you realize that that whole phase of your life is over, and move on, the better off you're going to be
Why don't you bring this into the open
talk about it in group
Oh, here's our ride
Saying this, he turns as an elevator
It's pretty crowded
He holds the door for her
(confused) Talk about it
Seeing he's waiting, she straightens, moves into the elevator

Thanks
() 28
: (to him) "Talk about it in group
" Is that the answer to everything around here
The doors
Everyone huddles in the compact space silently, politely
The elevator heaves into movement
It as it whisks down the shaft
The overhead fluorescent light in the car is weak
It flickers off and on momentarily
Nobody ever said it would be easy
And it works for a lot of people
(gently) It's not working for Ralph
or his chest
(pleading tone) Can't you at least transfer me
get me in a group of people with problems a little more like mine-- Cynthia, we don't have a lot of patients who've been in a coma for over a decade
The light gets weaker
Finally it just goes out
There is a general  of annoyance from the passengers
The light  on every few seconds giving off the effect of a strobe light
You'd think with what they charge here they could pay their electric bills Relax
They're probably giving shock therapy
(for Alan's benefit) "It works for most people"

Then Cynthia is  by the sight of something across the elevator

Another
Harris is gone
Suddenly the , but the doors '
Passengers , annoyed
Oh, great-- The emergency  starts sounding
Cynthia, still confused, gets shoved against the back wall as the passengers busy themselves pushing buttons
Cynthia bumps into the man next to her
She looks up at him
It is Harris
Harris reaches out to Cynthia
She  , jerks away, slamming into Alan, falling to the floor
(') Jesus, lady, relax
We're on the ground floor-- Let me out
Let me out--
Cynthia is on the floor
She raises her head
Someone is on the floor right across from her
It's Harris
His face is burned and skeletal
He Unity, Cynthia
Now and forever
He has no eyelids or lips
Cynthia , struggles to her feet, knocking over another passenger
Now it's chaos in here
Let me out, let me out
Alan, help, help--

You belong to us Forever--

Alan runs out to aid her
The passengers get off the elevator, looking at her oddly runs up and turns off the alarm
Cynthia, what happened--
It's him
It's him
He's alive-- Who's alive
(pointing) He's alive
Right over-- She stops
The elevator is open and empty
The passengers watch her, some concerned, some voyeuristic
Now they drift away

Alan just stares at her

: --hallucination, flashback,  don't know what to call it- How about psychotic episode
No, no, she doesn't fit the pattern-- Addictive personalities can be borderline
You know that-- (patiently) She has no history of drug abuse-- There's other kinds of addictions
(standing, pensive) we see it in these fringe religious groups
these instant creeds with pseudo-Messianic delusions
You've heard how she talks about Unity House
Perhaps that's her drug
Perhaps she's going through a--withdrawal of sorts
Her memory lapses about Unity House are equally symptomatic
There's some violent turmoil under that pretty little facade
(skeptical) You put her in the Borderline Group and she became one
No

Cynthia sits on the bed, watches as Hettie counts out pills for her
Cynthia swallows them, hesitates at a red one
This one's new
It'll help you sleep
(explaining) Sort of a post-elevator cocktail
Cynthia scowls, takes it
Hettie goes out
Cynthia lies down on the bed, stiff
Turns over once or twice
Sighing, she picks up the  remote, shakes her head at the myriad buttons
Finally she finds the right one,
39    -
39 She's come in on the middle of a group therapy scene from (: Or maybe    or ) 40                                                        40 She watches until she realizes what it is, then  it off

'  -                                      42 Cynthia lies restlessly in her bed
She hears footsteps coming closer
They stop at her door
She looks over
There is a  moving in the crack under the door
The doorknob
Cynthia sits up
Who's there
She reaches for the button to call the nurse, but then the door is , and the figure stands there silhouetted
(whisper) Cynthia
The figure comes forward
Cynthia backs off the other side of the bed and turns on a light
It is Victor, the boy we remember from the opening scene
The years have been kind to him
He stands there, the dim light spilling on his Army field jacket and bell-bottomed jeans
Cynthia
It's me
Victor
(amazed) Vic
Oh, my God-- She practically leaps across the room, hugs him with all her strength
Look at you
(marveling) Little Cyn
(impressed) Not so little anymore
Vic, this is just
fantastic, it's the most incredible
(hesitating) But
how can you be here
Yeah
It is after visiting hours-- () 34
: mean
they said that
that everybody died
(smiling) Do  look like a ghost to you
(rapid-fire) How did you survive
How did you find me
Is anyone else-- Whoa, whoa
It's a long story
(looking around) Let me tell it somewhere else feel like 'm in, like, the Pentagon or something
Cynthia grins, grabs a light jacket
Then let's go
43
43 Victor peeks out the door
An orderly passes, then disappears
Victor and Cynthia tiptoe out, sprint down the corridor to a stairwell marked "", and they are gone
44
-                                        44 Victor takes her hand, and they run towards a battered van
We recognize it and its slogans
Zeke
You've still got Zeke
She runs her hand along the dusty side lovingly, and then they hop inside
45                                             45 Rusted, dated 1973

"Zeke" pulls up, rattling to a coughing halt
They get out, head up the steps
47
'  -                                    47 They come in, turning on lights
It's a dingy couple of rooms, but lush with its variety of objects
Everything looks like it came from the Age of Aquarius: beanbag furniture, paper "Tiffany" shades on hanging lights, blacklight posters, hanging macrame planters
Cynthia loves the room and everything in it
But she is particularly drawn to a canvas on an easel in the far corner
48    -                                                  48 It's of her, sitting serenely in a meadow, the Unity House perched prominently on a hill in the distance
(In the doorway, the bare-chested  of a man may--or may not--be barely visible
) Cynthia's clothes in the painting are the ones she wore in the opening scene
But her face is that of today's Cynthia

what you'd
look like today
Guess  came pretty close
It's beautiful
More beautiful than  ever was
(softly) Then you need a new mirror
she smiles, flattered
Suddenly a  jumps up on a crate
(') That's Chairman Meow
Cynthia picks him up
Victor takes out a bottle of tequila and two glasses
() 36
: You still haven't told me how you lived
really can't remember anything about the
accident
It wasn't an accident
She stiffens
His eyes are far away
(') lot of people back then, they hated Unity House
Hated Harris and his dreams
dreams of peace
of oneness
That hate fed negative energy into the cosmic vortex
Something bad was bound to happen
That hate was so strong
so envious of what we had
He has  the shot glass in his hand so hard that it Cynthia , and that's when he notices it
(') (very normal) Oh, fuck-- You've cut yourself-- She comes over, binds his hand with a dishcloth
He holds onto her
guess talking about the past can be a little dangerous
He pours a shot into the remaining glass
(') Let's drink to the present
(pause) To us
He
Passes the glass to her

Unity
He pulls her close
They
she seems to malt in his grasp
The cat jumps down
Slowly they kiss and touch each other
They stop and stare into each other's eyes
He moves his hand over her shoulders, neck, through her hair
She is completely his
: 52
-                                       52 Half a dozen candles illuminate the room
Cynthia and Victor are making love
Not violent, but slow, passionate, dreamlike
They are completely enjoying each other
The satisfaction seems spiritual
They stare into each other's eyes the entire time
They are lost
Gradually Victor's rhythm builds
As his momentum increases, as the ecstasy nears, Cynthia accelerates too
Heaving, gasping, they are approaching a beautiful climax
But just when it seems Victor is on the verge, the very threshold, he stops and  violently out of bed
Oh Jesus
Victor
Victor paces around the room, practically bouncing off the walls
Oh, my God
can't believe it
What a great idea
Too amazing
Too amazing
Is something wrong
() 38
: Not wrong, Cynthia
right
The most right thing in the world
He goes to his closet and pulls out a shoe box
He holds it with a coy expression, like a kid hiding a frog
Cynthia's annoyance with the break in mood fades in light of his exuberance
Their tone with each other remains loving, kidding
Are you going to tell me your little secret, or should  just got dressed
'm sorry, Cyn, but  just got the most incredible idea
It's absolutely beautiful
Do you want to know what it is
(exasperated) Yes
He sits on the bad
was just thinking about what we were doing here together
should hope so
Wouldn't it be incredible if, right at the perfect moment right when we're coming, if we did it
Did what
What we were meant to do, of course
(puzzled) meant to do
() 39
: (2) That sunset
That last night
At Unity House
Remember
No
No, Victor,  don't
(distant) They all got to go
You and me
we got left behind
while they went on
(chuckling) Guess that's why they say life ain't fair
Well
He opens the box
Inside it are
(') --we can fix that
(stiffening) My God, Victor
Put those away-- He ignores her, checks the cylinder on the revolver, the clip on the automatic
This is so great
mean, 've been living with all this shit, thinking about you, searching
going nowhere
And you, hell, you don't fit in with Ralph and Miriam, those other flakes
Berrisford and Goldman, they're a waste of time-- -how do you know about them never-- He  the clip home,  the cylinder
Yeah
We had the answers, way back then
Unity
Unity, now and forever
Cynthia, this is our second chance
She shrinks away from him on the bed
He bounces closer like a kid at a pajama party, holds out one of the pistols
() 40
: (3) (') Okay, you do me, and 'll do you-- but wait until  say go
Hey, get rid of the sheet
Let me see that grown up body
He grins, puts the gun to her head and gets an top of her
No, Vic
Please
Please
don't want to do this
Yes, you do
You know you do
No
He's holding her down
He's getting into it
Oh, Cynthia, it's so beautiful
God, God, no-- We're on the edge of space and time
He spreads her legs under the sheets
She's struggling against him, but it's no use
He's too strong
He's coming closer
(') Oh, good
good
ummm
ummm

Put the gun to my head
Jesus, Vic, no
Yeah, oh yeah

The candles are out
Victor isn't in the room
Cynthia, drenched with sweat, slowly catches her breath
She looks around, confused
(') Vic
She goes into the other room

54 No Vic
It is dark except for a  in the fireplace
The flames  oddly on the slick surface of the oil painting of Unity House

She checks in the kitchen
Nothing
She looks back in the bedroom
The apartment is empty
She's just calming when--
The   out of nowhere, startling her, and then running out of sight
She swallows
Very nervous now, she sits on the couch and starts pulling on her jeans and shoes
The her, revealing the entire apartment
We see It is completely quiet and still

Where are you going
Cynthia  from fright
Jesus, Vic
thought you
left
Me
Leave you all alone
He pulls her into his arms
She hesitates

Vic, are you
happy
That
(kissing her) has to be
(kissing again) the stupidest question  ever heard
He keeps kissing, caressing

with
life
With
being alive
He looks at her oddly
What are you talking about
(relaxing) Never mind
had this
bizarre dream
Welcome to reality
He touches her soft face
He runs his hands down her neck

Their embrace is so all-encompassing that, when she opens her eyes, it's only then that she 55                                                                55 She is kissing a It is Harris' face, the face we saw in the elevator

He's Victor again, normal again

It's spilled all over the floor
She is speechless
He picks the bottle up

Please let me out

What did do
Nothing
It's not you, it
it's me

Look, what we were feeling
it was special

Lieutenant, if called the police every time one of my patients experienced a fantasy or a delusion, you'd have to move in here-- () 48
: (sharp, stepping forward) It was not a delusion
Victor Lunes was here-- The security guard didn't see anyone-- Then the security guard needs glasses
Alan, tell them-- (on the spot) The apartment did match her general description-- --a one bedroom flat with a beige rug
that's rather
generic
--Victor isn't generic-- Victor is dead
Dead for fifteen years-- --you've seen his body
--it was burned beyond recognition-- but there was

Look
we've all done it

: (2) No one's denying you flow the coop, Miss Weston
You wanna prove the rest
Lemme get a policewoman to stand by while a gynecologist checks out your plumbing
We'll see soon enough if your ghost left a calling card-- Cynthia hauls off and gives Wasserman a tremendous
You bastard
She goes to the door, looks at the doctors
(') You

She goes out,  the door
Wasserman rubs his jaw, checks his mouth
Wonderful
Wonderful
've been waiting and waiting for her to finally show real anger--real emotion
This could be a breakthrough
(sincere) Thank you, Lieutenant
Wasserman holds a filling in his fingertips
Hey
Anytime
: - past a row of
We , see that each member of the group has a big pillow in front of them
Okay
First off, we're all going to feel a little silly and maybe look a little silly

As Alan continues speaking, he occasionally looks at her, but--to her relief-- deliberately doesn't single her out
(amused, but pushing on) --but this technique works, and we're going to release some of our hidden aggression
Who's going to go first
Lana
(pause) How many helpless goose had to die to fill those stupid pillows
(as everyone groans) None, Lana
They're polyester
Ed
Want to start
Nah
Let's talk about the geese again
Nice fat ones, with all the trimmings-- All right, how about if we all start together and eliminate the wimp factor
Come on
He starts  his pillow with a steady beat
Gradually, self-consciously, the others  in except for Cynthia
(') (standing, walking around the circle) Okay
What are we feeling
(as she pounds) We used to do something like this in the royal palace in Atlantis
But we used bags of dried kelp

Miriam

No, maybe my third

Please, people, let's work at being serious
He moves behind Cynthia, who's still unmoving
Leans close, whispers
(') know you had a rough night
But you have to participate
She sighs, starts to pound the pillow
At first she's very distracted, but then she gets into an unconscious rhythm

(') Okay, that's better
Now let's hear some emotion
Let it out
yell
Scream
Miriam gives a very theatrical scream
There's some laughter, but others try, too
Gilda begins to give little angry yelps
Ralph is really punching some ancient enemy
Connie does a respectable if modest
Ed  with more anger than we'd expect

They are oblivious to the change around them
Now their pounding gradually , becomes a background voodoo- like
Cynthia is speechless
She looks at then in amazement, but none of them notice her
Suddenly she sees 75A                                                                75A He's across from her,
Again, he sleeks back his hair in that amber liquid
You failed me, Cynthia
You failed all of us
Harris holds a wooden match
With it he presses back a fingernail
It snaps off and bleeds
Harris watches Cynthia

in this world
and in the next
to take in the cistern of liquid
We  the dripping wet Unity members

You shouldn't have run

She looks over at Alan, who seems not to see any of this
Now, eyes widening in horror, Cynthia   and sees a It washes against the pillow, her knees

The room is decorated in comforting tones, with Sierra Club posters and outdoors-y souvenirs
The late afternoon sun steams in through the partially closed blinds
Alan sits beside Cynthia on the couch, concerned
Berrisford sucks on his pipe, makes notes
Wasserman, rocking on the legs of his chair, jots in his own little notebook
(softly, tense) They
they sang songs as they stacked up the white containers

happy
Because it was going to be their break with the world
a world that didn't understand them

decided
But they all agreed
They were

Hettie appears in the doorway, tray in hand, raises her eyebrows inquisitively at Alan
Alan nods immediately: Hell, yes
Hettie comes in, gives Cynthia her medication
Wasserman closes his book, looks thoughtful
(to Wasserman) If that's what happened, why didn't you find any evidence of arson
The plastic jerry cans would've burned up before anything else
We knew there'd been an explosion
We just didn't know how or why
Berrisford stands, approaches Wasserman as the police officer closes his book, moves to the doorway
Well
You must be pleased
Closing a case after
what is it, twelve years
Who says it's closed
The medical people look at him
Cynthia's thoughts are elsewhere
What's that supposed to mean
When the fairy princess here woke up, she said she didn't remember anything about 32 deaths
Now she remembers they committed suicide

She passes Lana and Miriam
Miriam is dressing, and Lana is putting on a swimsuit
Nothing like a hot shower, huh
Cynthia doesn't hear or see them
She settles on the far end of the bench
She sits there blankly
Lana nears, with great trepidation
Cynthia
Cynthia
Are you okay

Are you all right
After that session today, -- 'm fine

(distant tone) All my friends are dead
Rattled, Lana backs off, on the verge of tears, rushing past Miriam, who has observed all this
Lana, wait a minute, she didn't mean it--shit
Miriam closes her locker and comes over to Cynthia
(') know Lana's a mealy-mouthed little prude, but she means well
probably pull her chain too much
She's reaching out, like all of us
Try and help her

Harris stands waist- deep in the pond
The Unity House Members all sit or stand on the shore
Harris holds his hands out in a gesture girl comes forward through the group out into the water
It is Cynthia, the younger Cynthia, with long hair in a braid
She smiles at Harris as she nears him
He clutches her hands
Behind the tree, Cynthia watches "herself," absorbed
Harris looks into Cynthia's eyes
He touches her face

Alan watches, concerned
Cynthia flails on the bed, already reacting to the sedative qualities of the drug
--He killed her--he killed her because  broke my word
He said he'd take someone else, and he did
She wanted my help
my friendship
That's why
he took her
She's out cold
Behind the doctors, in the doorway, the other clinic patients press close, curious
Hettie pushes them out and down the hallway
Move it, people, this ain't a sideshow
Get back to your rooms
Alan looks down at Cynthia with genuine concern
But Berrisford eyes her totally clinically
(thinking aloud) Fascinating
() () 61
:             (') She's a textbook specimen from a collective environment, an immersion philosophy, run by an extremely manipulative figurehead with Messianic delusions
Unity House at its apex must have been a classic matrix of belief impression overlaid on collectivity-- (exciting himself) That would indicate she's symptomatic of a hypothetical Borderline Personality syndrome among cult followers, all externalizing their anxiety

Alan looks at him disbelievingly
(exploding) think she's fucking freaked out about Lana
(a shrug) Possible

They look unsettled
(aside to Ralph) Did you see the swimming pool this morning
The cops are all over it
Fingerprints, photographs
Next they'll send in the fucking coast guard
Lot of good it'll do Lana

Hettie looks at him
Ralph, we're gonna start billing you for these outbursts

Connie sits in a sunbeam, looking ethereal
Gilda is nearby, unmoving
tear stains on her cheeks
Drowning isn't so bad remember when  died in Atlantis
It was like failing asleep
You know what's bad
Burning
When was in the great Fire of London, well, let me tell you-- Hearing this, Cynthia chokes back a sob, jumps up and leaves the room
Miriam whirls on Connie
Connie,  don't know about your previous lives, but in this one, you're a shithead
She follows Cynthia

Miriam comes in, sits beside her

Honey, you can't blame yourself
Lana was an unhappy girl
Sometimes unhappy girls do foolish things
She didn't kill herself
Cynthia sits up

Harris

: From Unity House
He comes to me, Miriam
He talks to me
He reminds me that  was supposed to go with them that night-- Go with them-- Through the fire
To the next world
They waited while  was in a coma
He told me that if didn't join him, he would take someone also
and he did it, Miriam, he did it
Miriam gets up, her face a mixture of sympathy
sympathy and something else
She lights a cigarette
Involuntarily, Cynthia  at the spark
(') You
you don't believe me, do you
believe that you believe it
And also believe that shooting you up every time you get the heebie- jeebies ain't gonna do shit for your real problems
We gotta get you out of here--get you to some nice place at the beach or the mountains where you can fight your demons in your own way

Maybe this is the time

Hell, you're not an article, you're a goddamned mini- series
() 65
: (3) don't know
Cynthia, let me be honest
This is a great story, and it means a second chance for me, so, okay, there's some self interest here
But  really think you need to tell people about Unity House
about the way decent ideas and dreams got twisted into something sick and poisonous
You owe it to the world
You owe it to yourself
It's your life, and you have to ask yourself how you want to live it
(sharper) --if you want to live it
Cynthia turns, mind made up
Let's do it

He heads off in the opposite direction
Cynthia watches him

Miriam is alone in the elevator except for one other person

Cynthia
We want you to stay with us
You mustn't be afraid
She is in total panic, running blindly

: Please, no
Branches thrash her face
She can barely see where she is going, but she comes to a halt when she reaches a dark precipice, a cliff which seemingly has no bottom--just black as night
The people are getting nearer
She's over here
We see someone nearing through the brush
No pain, Cynthia
There's no pain
Come with us

The door is just closing, but it opens again against a purse--Miriam's purse

Berrisford addresses a pack of about thirty  and and
Dr
Berrisford, what would you call two suicides on your promises so close together
'd call it a tragic coincidence
Unfortunately, Borderline Personality Disorder is indicative of a pre-existing disposition towards suicidal tendencies
What about the commune girl

As that is a police matter,  am not at liberty to comment on it

Alan looks over
The room is dark, except for the red light flashing on and off
Cynthia is crouched in the far corner by the open window

Berrisford's been tampering with the medication for everybody in the group--that's why they've been committing suicide--he's been making them crazy-- But Harris comes to me
He speaks to me-- () 106
: drug induced psychotic state is very suggestible
All we've hearing for days is "Harris, Harris,"
so that's what we all saw
That's what  saw when took Ralph's pill
It's all part of Berrisford's plan--he has this fucked-up theory about how you still think you're part of the Unity House, and the only way he can prove it is if you want to kill yourself
Behind Alan, the dark shape of Berrisford emerges from outside the window
It is climbing inside from the ledge

He's going to want you to kill yourself
He's recreating the whole thing for you
But you can't listen to him

He clutches bloody bandages to his hand, tries to hear Cynthia
It's okay
It's over
It was Berrisford
He killed them
Then all those other things
Faces
voices
They were
in my head
It was Berrisford
He shot you up with hallucinogens
What he didn't do, you imagined
There is joy through her delirium
She is just able to clasp hands with him briefly before she disappears behind a set of double doors

They both look relaxed
They both have bandaged hands
Go right if that's the interstate
Yeah, it is
207
-                                                207 Through the greenery are the charred and overgrown remains of Unity House
chiseled sign embedded into a tree verifies it
Alan and Cynthia pull up, park
Cynthia gets out and looks around
She goes to the front entrance
Alan follows her in

Daylight pours in through the faded, burnt slats of wood
Patches of woods have sprouted up
Cynthia wanders in and marvels at it all
Only piles of charcoal signify where furniture was
Alan meanders in from the other and of the house
Victorian
Looks like it was a nice house once
Yes
guess appearances can be deceiving
She moves out upstairs
He follows her up onto the risky- looking steps
209                                                            209 She reaches a point at the top that looks out over the meadow and pond
She looks out
Alan joins her
Cynthia takes in the view contentedly
(') It's dead
It's really dead
What
() 115
: She gestures to the house around them
It's over
Alan smiles
He pulls her close to him
They look into each other's eyes
Neither of them is completely at ease with the other, but there is honest affection
They hug, then kiss

He's talking to his  as the police officers enter
(in mid-speech) --letters of support could have an influence on the court
You know, from your peers--

(turning) Hello, Lieutenant
(smiling) Forgive me for not getting up
Real funny, Doctor
Try this for laughs: As soon as you're ambulatory, you're going in front of a Grand Jury, and you're going to be charged with six counts of obstruction of justice and two counts of assault
() () 116
:             (') Then it gets choice: five counts of murder in the first degree, one count of murder in the second degree
Add the civil liability to all that, and you're going to have plenty of time to write that book
Well
don't agree with your definition of justice, but suppose  obstructed it
All in the name of science, of course-- (appalled) Doctor Berrisford-- (hushing him) --but as to murder, well, Lieutenant,  beg to differ didn't kill anyone
Why would
'm only interested in knowledge
Cynthia is a unique girl--the product of an environment and a philosophy unrivaled in its purity
wanted to understand the depth of her commitment, the link between psychosis and total immersion philosophies, the dark terra incognita of the human psyche-- (fed up) Hey, go chow on a Latin dictionary, okay
You can bullshit all you want, but how do you account for six bodies
Clearly some unknown variable was a factor
Yeah
Well, if you didn't kill off the therapy group, who did
Lieutenant, 'll put it in terms even a policeman can understand
He smiles, shrugs the best he can in his plaster cast

Cynthia pulls away
What's the matter
was just thinking about Gilda
Somehow, she knew
She kept talking about "him," but  didn't know what she meant
She said the answer was inside me
Why would she say that
Alan doesn't have an answer
She sighs
Let's go
You go down
'll be out in a minute
just want to
bury some memories
You sure
She nods
He goes
Cynthia gives a final look around at the deteriorated structure and turns down the stairs
She stands at the top of what remains of the stairs
We
Just as she nears the bottom, the of a clock is audible
It gets
Cynthia reaches the last stop and turns into 118

The foyer is new now, completely untouched by fire, just as it was at the beginning of the film
candelabrum is lit
Cynthia turns and we
It is new, unburnt
Two  come scrambling down the stairs laughing
The entranceway, the archway to the front room, the staircase are all intact, just as we saw them in the opening scene
peers into the kitchen
Two  in work aprons are kneading bread dough, chopping vegetables
They smile at Cynthia
1 Cynthia
Are you staying for supper
Cynthia is silent, wide-eyed, taking it all in
She turns towards the front door
Victor is coming in
Cynthia
It's good
Come in
She in unable to resist
216
-                                            216 They walk in
The room is filled with people
There is a fire in the hearth
Children play
Candles illuminate the space
Unity Members smile and great her casually as she passes them
Miriam in talking with a   intently
Cynthia, 'm so glad you're here
Ed and Connie are by the fireplace with some others
They smile at Cynthia knowingly
Lana is sitting contentedly on the window seat reading with some children
Ralph is crouched with victor in a corner
They are laughing warmly
() 119
: Gilda comes up to her
She is ebullient, happier, healthier looking than we've ever seen her
Cynthia, it's so wonderful here, but we miss you terribly
Cynthia nears Harris
He smiles at her and kisses her
Everyone in the room turns to her
Harris holds up a shiny and sharp knife with ornamentation on the handle
Cynthia doesn't see it yet
He puts the pointed tip against her chest
It's time, Cynthia
It's finally time, isn't it
Yes
(fighting the vision) You don't exist
wouldn't say that
(he touches her) Go on
Take the knife
She can't escape his gaze
(') Do it
You know you want to
You know you do, Cynthia
You'll see how beautiful it is
You will
Cynthia clasps her hand around the knife at her chest, Harris lets go
She holds it there by herself, completely hypnotized by his words, by his eyes
Cynthia, we're only telling you this because we love you
() 120
: (2) Beautiful lovechild
All will be in balance when you've joined us
All will be right when daughter is with father
You're special, Cynthia
Scared blood
daughter of the father
Cynthia in mortified
'm
Now you remember
Yes
My own beautiful lovechild
Everyone has proven their love to me
Now you must
She is weak now
She is about to do it
Her grasp tightens around the knife handle
She's trembling
She takes a deep breath
No
She jams the knife into Harris' throat and pulls it out
(') No  don't
don't love you don't need you
She is crazed
She flies around the room brandishing the knife at everyone
They back off
(') never loved any of you
hate you
hate you all
What you did was wrong
() 121
: (3) She swats the knife at them all
Victor's arm gets cut
Gilda has to dive away from her
Cynthia is knocking over lamps and chairs in her rage
She is crying hysterically
(') It was
It was stupid
(saddened) Oh, Cynthia
never needed you
Any of you
We are
She is winding down, crying with her face buried in her arms
(') never did
She is still
Gradually, the silence fills with a quiet Cynthia
She drops the knife
The knife is all rusty and corroded
The floor is a charred mass
Cynthia turns around
Alan comes in the front door
The room is again its empty, skeletal self, blackened and silent
Cynthia is trembling
She walks out of the room
(') Are you all right
Let's go

-                                             217 She stands on the porch, holding onto a post, trying to calm herself
Alan comes out
As he starts the car, a gust comes up
The trees are thrashed around
The   through the house

Cynthia descends the stairs
The station wagon pulls up
She gets inside

Slowly we see Cynthia collect herself sense of hope is evident
It's going to be okay
'm going to be okay

The winds kicks up again

(far off) Come on, where are you
hope you're not in that house
You always got like this and make stupid threats that you don't mean
The girl peeks out the corner of the window

She whirls around

You're upset
She nods

Eternal bliss

It begins to transform from its rusty and corroded state into a new and shiny knife
burned, skeletal hand reaches   and takes it
