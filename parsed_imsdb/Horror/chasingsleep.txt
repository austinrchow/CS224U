- Ed lies awake in bed
He is sweaty and nervous
His eyes are wide-open, blood-shot and tired
He picks up his bedside clock which is ticking loudly
It is 3:37
He looks over at the other side of the queen-size bed
It is still made
He picks a long, blonde hair from the pillow and examines it curiously
There is a noise outside and Ed gets up to investigate
- Ed walks through the dark hallway and into the living room of his small house
By the front door, hanging on the wall, is a framed picture of Eve, Ed's wife
Ed passes by it and looks outside through the window
There is some wind outside, but nothing else
Ed looks longingly at his reflection
Ed Saxon, 45, is a morbid, insecure man
His frustration with his life has tinged his sense of humor with an acerbic bite
His early success, a few publications of his poetry, has given him a professorship at the University
He is well-read, intelligent, a bit pompous and occasionally condescending
But mostly, these qualities are restrained and his outward appearance is a little sorrowful
There is an unquestionable charm about him, and its effect is evident in the people around him
He searches through the medicine cabinet, which is full of women's items, and takes out a Cosco-sized bottle of sleeping pills
He reads the back and takes two
He hears something bang against the front door
He opens the front door and takes a step outside
- He looks down by his feet and finds the morning paper, wrapped in blue plastic, lying on the doormat
He picks it up and goes back inside
Ed stands helplessly in the empty living room
Ed's desk sits on one side of the living room, crammed into the corner
He searches quickly through the stuff on the desk and finds a small address book
He finds a name in the book and dials the number
(over phone) Hello
Susie
Hi, it's Ed
'm sorry  woke you up
Is something wrong
Eve isn't there, is she
No
She's not there
No
She didn't come home after work
Oh, no
Didn't she call or anything
No
She was supposed to be home around six
cooked her dinner
Could she have gone anywhere else
don't think so
Do you
don't know
'm a little worried
bet
Did you call Harborview
No
Do you think  should
Yeah
If she got into an accident of something, they would take her there
You don't think that's overreacting
Don't be silly
Just call them
It can't hurt
Alright
But if she comes home later and it turns out to be nothing, don't tell her  called the hospital,
Call me back
Alright
Ed finds the Yellow Pages and finds a page of "non-emergency" numbers
His finger runs down the list: Trauma, Fire, Disaster, etc
until he comes to Hospitals and then Harborview
He dials the number
Harborview
Hello
wanted to find out if someone had come in
In an emergency, maybe
Hold on
She transfers him and the phone rings again
Emergency room
wanted to find out if someone had been brought in
What's the last name
Saxon
Eve Saxon
Are you a relative
She's my wife
One second
No
No one with last name Saxon
Are there any other hospitals that  could check
Well, we serve as the emergency room for King County, so unless they specified a hospital, they would have been brought here
In an emergency
Thank you
He calls Susie back
What happened
Nothing
Jeez
Did you guys have a fight
No
No
Did you call the school
Yeah, a while ago
No one answered the phone there
It's not like her to not call, is it
No, she would have called
Why don't you call the police
The police
Maybe they know something
Like if she was in an accident
It's going a little far, don't you think
don't know
If you're worried
It's not like the police have anything better to do
guess
'll call you tomorrow
Sorry to wake you up
It's
Call me tomorrow
He hangs up
- Ed looks around the kitchen, searching lazily for something to eat
He opens a cabinet that is full of boxes of fat-free Skin-( chocolate-marshmallow cookies
He opens the fridge, looks around and takes the plate of food he made for his wife
He takes off the cellophane and starts to eat
He sits at the table, but after a few more bites, he loses his appetite
- Ed sits at his desk, staring at the phone
He takes a breath and calls 911
911 emergency
Hi
don't think this is an emergency
What's the problem
My wife hasn't come home and,  don't know
wanted to check with the police to see if there was an accident
When was the last time you saw her
This morning
She was supposed to come home from work, but she didn't
When does she get off work
Around six
Usually
She hasn't called since then
No
Do you have any idea where she might have gone
Maybe to a friend's house
don't think so
called the only place  could think of
But you were expecting her home
Yes
cooked dinner
could send a police officer to your house
Do you think that's necessary
Maybe  should wait
Until when
It's five in the morning
Maybe she went somewhere
Where
don't know
Should  be worried
would be
Yes, 'm worried
So, do you want me to send an officer to your house
don't think so
think  should wait
Do you think she's going to come home soon
hope so
So do
How long are you going to wait
little longer
think  may be overreacting
She might have gone somewhere  can't think of
Sometimes  worry too much
It's up to you
My name is Paul
'll be here if you change your mind
Ed hangs up
Ed takes the sleeping pills from the medicine cabinet and takes two more
Eve has a small room in the house that Ed is cautious about entering
He walks in and looks around, as if he hasn't been in there for a while
' The room is painted sky-blue and the ceiling has clouds painted on it
On one side of the room, there is a console piano with some sheet music resting on it
On the other side of the room is a small, antique writing desk
Ed sits down and looks at some of the items lying on it
There are a couple of letters and an address book
There is a box containing paper clips, etc
There is an open box of Skin-( cookies
There is a drawer in the desk which he tries to open, but finds that it is locked
He searches around the desk for a key, but can'' find one
He presses a little harder at the drawer, but it won't budge
He takes a letter opener from a jar on the desk and starts to fidget with it, but he still can't open it
Then he hears some distant voices coming from outside
He looks out the window where he can see the house next door
There is a light on in the neighbor's window, where the voices are coming from, and some vague shadows move around inside
Ed turns off the lights in Eve's room, so that he can see more clearly
From the muffled sounds, it is soon clear that the couple next door is having an argument
Only the woman's voice is clear
hate you
Stay away from me
Don't touch me
Just go to sleep
'll scream
am not screaming now
You don't know anything about me
Then the noise dies down and the woman can be heard sobbing in the distance
- Ed picks up the phone and dials 911
911 emergency
Hi
called before
think  was talking to Paul
Hold on
Paul comes on the line
This is Paul
Hi
called before
My wife hasn't come home
Yes
remember
You want me to send an officer over
Yes
What's your address
4523 East Street
He should be there in a few minutes
Yes
Thank you
You did the right thing, sir
Ed hangs up
Almost instantly, he sees some lights pass by the window
He looks through the window and sees a police car pull up
He opens the door and watches the officer as he approaches the house
is a youngish patrolman
He is relaxed, caring and formal
You called the police
Yes
It was me
That was fast
Thank you
Come in
Stewart is led a few steps into the living room
He looks around
Your wife didn't come home
Is that right
Yes
When was the last time you saw her
When she left for work this morning
She was supposed to come home after work
cooked dinner
And she made it to work, right
Yes
think so
don't know
What time does she usually come home
Around six
Yes
Usually
What does she look like
She's blonde, straight hair
What was she wearing
Do you remember
think it was a red sweater and a dress
What kind of car does she drive
Volvo
Gray
'85,  think
Stewart lets out a sigh of relief
Well, you had me worried
There was a blonde woman involved with a car-jacking around six
Apparently she was hit on the head by one of the perpetrators and then wandered away from the incident in a daze
Nobody's seen her since
When  got the call on the radio,  thought that must have been your wife, but this woman was driving a Pathfinder and was wearing jeans, so it probably wasn't her
You had me worried
She drove a Volvo
Drives a Volvo
That's a relief
Do you know anywhere your wife might have gone
called the only place  could think of
And  called the hospital
Harborview
Yes
Stewart takes a couple of pills from a bottle and takes them, chasing them down with a coffee he has with him
'm afraid there's not much  can do now
By law, we can't put out a missing persons until 72 hours has elapsed since the last time she was seen
72 hours
Usually in these cases, it was something stupid
Maybe she was upset about something, had to get away
Who knows
What  can do is take the license plate number of her car and if it shows up for some reason, we'll give you a call
Do you have your wife's license plate number
Yes
Actually, it's easy to remember
007
James Bond
Right
And , For Every Child
And what's her name
Eve
Eve Saxon
And your name
Ed
Saxon
Like  said, it was probably something stupid
Did you have a fight
Not at all
Well, you should try to get some sleep and, if she doesn't show up tomorrow, give us a call and we'll see what things look like then
Yes
Thank you
Usually, they come back
Yes
Thank you
feel much better now
Thank you for coming
No problem
You have a good night
Or morning,  guess
Yes
You too
Ed shuts the door
He's a little wired so he sits at his desk and picks up a pile of his students' papers
He reads the one on top, marking it with a red pen as he does
He hears a gurgling noise coming quietly from the bathroom
He gets up and walks into the- He looks around the bathroom, tracing the sound to the bathtub drain
It gets louder as he approaches it, but before he can investigate, there is a knock on the front door
- When Ed comes out to answer the door, it is now bright daylight outside
The sun is streaming in through the windows
Through the washed-out sunlight outside his window, Ed can see a police car parked in front of his house
Someone knocks again and Ed answers the door
As he does, he picks up the mail that has been dropped through the slot in the door
, 46, stands outside in plain clothes
Derm is, above all, a nice man
Experience has given him a knowing stare, but he is affable, not suspicious
He is consistently professional and genuinely concerned
Hello
Mr Saxon
Yes
Sorry to wake you up
wasn't asleep
Oh
called a few times and when there wasn't any answer  thought  better come over
What time is it
About 3:30
3:30
Maybe  did fall asleep
Damn
'm Detective Derm of the Seattle Police Department
You called last night about your wife
Yes
We found her car this morning
On Capitol Hill
Actually, somebody called it in
It was running
Running
Did your wife come home last night
No
Did she go to work today
don't know
haven't called
Do you have a number for her there
Sure
Ed picks up the phone and dials from memory
Why don't you let me
He hands Derm the phone
Hi, this is Detective Derm of the Seattle Police
was wondering if Mrs Eve Saxon had come into work today, or called in, any word from her
Yes
Since yesterday
Did you see her leave yesterday
Yes
About what time was that
'm not sure
Is she calls, or comes in, could you please ask her to call me
My number is 734-9722, extension 38
Thank you
Bye
He hangs up
She hasn't been in today
My God
She hasn't called here at all
No
Any messages
He points to the answering machine
It is blinking, full of messages
must have been asleep
That happens
was up late last night
understand
Why don't we listen to these messages
Alright
Ed pushes the button on the machine
The first message is from Eve's work
(on machine) Hi, this is Celeste, calling for Eve
We're worried about you
You don't come in
You don't call
No, seriously, we just want to make sure you're
Don't worry about your students
Marie's covering for you
But give us a call,
Bye
That's the school where Eve works
She's a piano teacher at Franklin High
Then there's a message for Ed
(on machine) Hello, Mr Saxon
This is Mrs Mastrioni from the University
You didn't show up for your morning class and 'm calling to see if you'll be in for your other classes so that  can make the proper arrangements
assume you remember how to use the phone
Damn
You're a teacher too
professor at the University
The next message is Derm
(on machine) Hello, this is Detective Derm from the Seattle Police Department
Derm takes a small pill box from his overcoat, while the machine plays in the background
That's me
Do you have a glass of water
Sure
Ed goes into the - - and fills a glass for the detective
When he comes back, he sees Derm casually looking over the woman's magazines on the coffee table
Derm picks up a filled-in New York Times Sunday Crossword and looks it over
Your wife did this
Yes
Smart woman
The acrostic, too
Ed hands Derm the water
Thank you
Meanwhile the next message comes on
It is a girl from Ed's class
(on machine) Hello, Mr Saxon
This is Sadie, from your creative writing class
Anyway, you didn't show up today and  just wanted to see if you were  and, you know, if there was any reading or anything you wanted us to do
My number is 323-4854
hope you're alright
Bye
student
Yes
Do they call you often
No, but they all have my number
The next message is from Susie
(on machine) He, Ed
just wanted to find out what happened last night
If Eve ever showed up, or what happened
Call me at work, 672-5695
thought she might have gone over there last night
Excuse me,  better call the University
The next message is Detective Derm again and it plays behind Ed's conversation
Hi, Mrs Mastrioni
(over phone) Yes
This is Ed Saxon
Oh, yes
Didn't make it in today, huh
guess not
There were students waiting for you
Yes,  know
It's a personal matter
personal matter, huh
That's right
So you'll be in tomorrow
Yes, tomorrow
Or you'll call
Or 'll call, yes
Hello
Hello
Ed hangs up, having been hung up on
He turns around to see Derm standing right by, listening to his call
The next message is from George Simian, a man who works with Eve
His cautious voice makes it known that it is weird that he is calling
Ed pays special attention to this call
Hi, Eve
This is George, from school
You didn't come into work today and  just wanted to make sure everything was guess 'll see you tomorrow
Who's that
Some guy she worked with
teacher,  think
see
Mr Saxon, does your wife have an address book
Yes
Could  see it, please
And a picture, if you have one
Certainly
Ed heads into - ' - and picks up the small address book from the desk
He hands the address book and takes a picture of Eve from his desk, removing from the frame
Great
Derm flips through the address book and a business card falls out
Derm picks it up and looks it over
George Simian
Is that the same George that called
Yes
This address, this George Simian lives on Capitol Hill, where we found your wife's car
Really
May  borrow this
suppose
'll call the numbers in here and see what  can turn up
Try no to worry, Mr Saxon
'll be in touch
Yes, thank you
Derm leaves
Ed shuts the door and locks it
The phone rings and Ed picks it up
Hello
(over phone) He, Mr Saxon
Yes
Hi, it's Sadie Crumb, from your creative writing class
Oh, yes
Hi
Are you
Is this a bad time to call
No
It's alright
was,  don't know, wondering if you were sick or something, when you didn't come to class
No, well, a little
Do you need anything
mean,  could bring you something
No,  don't think so
Really, it's no problem
Have you eaten
No, but
can bring you something to eat
It's no problem
Some soup or something
Really,  don't know if it's a good idea
Oh, 'm sorry
No, don't be
It's just that  don't feel too well
That's
used to volunteer at a hospital
Really
Yeah,  was a candy striper
You're kidding
What  mean is, 'm used to it
You know, sick people
Yeah
Where do you live
4523 East Street
'll be there soon
Oh
Do you not eat meat, or anything
No
eat anything
Great
Bye
Ed hangs up the phone
He walks into the - He looks in the mirror
His hair is a mess and he is unshaven
He looks tired
He turns on the shower
Ed takes off his clothes and walks back into the - He puts his hand under the water
It isn't warm yet, so he picks up his toothbrush and puts some paste on it
Then he hears a piano playing, behind the sound of the shower
It can hardly be heard
Eve
' He looks around Eve's room quickly
There is no one there
Ed goes back to the - He comes back into the bathroom
The music has stopped and all that can be heard is the shower filling up the tub
The water is about ankle-deep
Damn
Ed reaches into the drain and pulls out a clump of Eve's hair
He throws it into the toilet and then gets in the shower
The drain is obviously still clogged up
He is up to his knees in soapy water
- As Ed comes out of the shower, he sees that it is completely dark
There is a knock on the door
Hold on
One second
Ed grabs Eve's robe from the back of the bathroom door
- Ed answers the door
, 18, is the kind of girl who always has something to say in class, who has always done her homework and who has definite ideas about her future and the future of the planet
She is innocent and naive, nice and well-mannered
But also pushy and manipulative, used to getting her way
Hi, it's me
Oh, hi
Are you
didn't think you'd be here so fast
It's almost eight
Oh
seem to be having a little trouble with time
know what you mean
'm one of those people who is always late
Come in
hope you don't mind me coming over like this
It didn't occur to me that it might be a little strange until after  hung up
It's just, well, at my high school,  went to boarding school, and we were pretty close with our teachers
It's nice
Kindness
Very refreshing
brought you some soup
better get some clothes on
Make yourself at home
Ed gets dressed
As he does, he notices a pile of Eve's clothes on the floor
He picks them up and puts them in the closet, on top of a pile of Eve's dirty laundry
When Ed comes out, Sadie has put the soup in a bowl and set a place at the table
put it in a bowl for you
hope you don't mind
Thank you
Ed sits down and tastes the soup
It's good
got it at my favorite place
You don't mind me hanging out for a little while, do you
No
could use the company
Like  said,  haven't been feeling very well
Sadie notices the pile of papers on Ed's desk
Oh, you graded our papers
Some of them
Can  look
Sure
Sadie looks through the papers
She finds hers marked with a  minus
Oh
What is it
just
guess  though this one was better
Let me see
Ed looks over the paper for a second
He takes a pen and crosses out the  and changes it to an
was in a bad mood when  graded these
Don't change it if it's not good
It's just a grade
Please don't
No
Don't
Please
Sadie takes the paper away from him
Sorry
didn't mean to
It's just
don't think you're doing me any favors by letting me off easy
mean, 'm hear to learn
It means a lot to me to do well in your class
You're the best teacher 've had since  came to the University
How long has that been
Well, 'm still a freshman, but 've met a lot of teachers and 'm very discerning
Before  took your class  went to the library and looked up your work
You're kidding
No
read all your poems, or all they had
The ones in the New Yorker and in Poetry Magazine, and two short stories
What did you think
loved them; the poems especially
mean, they're dark, but they're so
true
Really
really got into them photocopied one and put it on my wall
hope you don't mind
Which one
"The Passion of my Youth"
It is so intense
"Her eyes blew gently, purposefully by my ears, echoing gentle pulses of bliss which bounced and fired like a chill on my whole being, leaving just a trace to fuel my longing
" My wife like that poem
You're married
Yes
Where's your wife
She's at her mother's
She's gone for a while
Oh
There is an awkward silence
May  use the bathroom
Sure
Go ahead
Sadie takes her purse and goes into the bathroom
Ed finishes his soup
The phone rings and he picks it up
Hello
Is this Ed
Yes
This is George Simian
Yes
Where's Eve
Why do you want to talk to Eve
What have you done
Excuse me
You've done something
know you have
What are you talking about
The police found her car near my house
They think  have something to do with her disappearance
Maybe it's because you were fucking her
You son of a bitch
What did you do
If you hurt her,  swear, 'm going to kill you
Look, she disappeared
haven't seen her
Why do you think  called the police
'll kill you
'll kill you, you bastard
swear
Ed hangs up
He is shaky, but also strangely exhilarated
He turns off the ringer on the phone and turns down the volume on the answering machine
He brings the rest of the soup to the sink, scrapes it into the garbage disposal, and flicks the switch
When the food has gone down, he starts to wash the dishes
He stops and looks back to the bathroom
Ed walks over to the bathroom door
Sadie
There is no answer
He knocks on the door
Sadie
Is everything alright
There is still no answer
'm coming in
Ed opens the door
Sadie is lying on the floor, passed out
Her pants are around her knees, as if she passed out while standing up from the toilet
Her nose is bleeding, like she might have hit it on the way down
It has bled on her sweater
The air from the open door wakes her up, but she is in a heavy daze
Are you alright
My God
What happened
Ed comes over to her and lifts her head
She stares at him strangely
Can you stand
Do you understand me
'll help you to the bedroom
Sadie notices her pants are down
Oh
'll wait outside
Ed waits outside and, a second later, Sadie comes out, still reeling, clutching her purse
She leans on Ed, who leads her into the bedroom
Sadie lies down on the bed
You want some water
Yes, please
Ed goes into the - He takes a glass from the cupboard and fills it up
He stops, having noticed something on the glass
He holds the glass up to the light
Eve's lipstick is clearly marked on the rim
He puts that glass down and fills another
When he comes back, he finds Sadie digging through her purse
She pulls out an asthma inhaler and takes a couple of big hits
Then she sits on the bed and drinks a little water
'm so embarrassed
No, don't be
God, my nose
Does it hurt
No, but the blood
Maybe you hit it when you fell
It was so weird
heard someone's voice, a woman's voice
Like a scream
And then it was like all my blood left my body
Sometimes you can hear the neighbors
It was like it echoed around the bathroom
Maybe  imagined it
've been taking these caffeine pills to stay awake
Just relax
should go
can't let you leave like this
didn't mean to be such a burden
'm such a loser
am so sorry about this
It seems that her nose has stopped bleeding, but her sweater has a surprising amount of blood on it
'll get you a towel
Ed leaves and then comes back with a wet towel
He starts to wipe the blood off her nose
feel better now
Thank you
Do you want me to drive you home
'll be
Maybe you want me to call your roommate
My roommate moved out
She hated me
She said  was immature, do you believe that
Your friends, then
don't have any friends
don't know what it is
People don't like me here
thought it would be a good idea to go to a school far away from home, but since 've been here, it's like,  spend all this time on my own
At my high school, my friends and  were so close
just don't get along with people anymore
don't know what it is
You get along with me
You're the first person 've met since 've been here that talks to me like a real person
Ed walks over to the closet and takes out a sweater
You can borrow this, if you want
It's my wife's
She wouldn't mind
No
bled so much
Ed gets up to give her some room
She slips out of her sweater and puts the other one on
Sadie looks at a picture next to the bed
Is this your wife
That's my mother
That picture is older than it looks
She's so pretty
She was young when that was taken
She died a few years ago
That's awful
How'd she die
Cancer
It was quite an ordeal
She died very slowly
That's so sad
better go, huh
It's getting late
Ed walks her to the door
'm sorry about everything
Don't be sorry
'm glad you came
'll see you tomorrow
Tomorrow
In school
You'll be there, right
Oh, yes
'll be there
Bye
Sadie kisses him on the cheek and then leaves
Ed locks the door after her
Ed looks at the tub in the bathroom which is full of water
He sticks his finger deep into the drain, trying to free whatever is in there
There is another tuft of hair, and again he throws it into the toilet
The gurgling sound that he heard before has come back, resonating through the soapy water from the drain
Ed follows the gurgling sounds into the basement
He takes a flashlight from behind the basement door and shines it at the pipes that lead from the bathtub drain
He can hear the gurgling sound running through them
It sound like they ate something they can't digest
He reaches up and touches the pipe
It seems to be leaking a little, or maybe it is condensation
Ed traces the noise to a larger sewage pipe that runs down into the basement floor
He watches the pipe, but slowly, his attention is drawn to the shadow next to the pipe
As he stares intently into the darkness of the shadow, a figure begins to emerge in the distance
The darkness begins to change into a long hallway
small figure is walking towards Ed and his footsteps echo in the distance
Ed watches, mesmerized
The basement fades into the blackness, and now, the hallway becomes more clear
It is a very long hospital hallway, and the figure walking toward Ed is a doctor, carrying a clipboard
Mr Saxon
Yes
There's nothing we can do for her now except to alleviate any pain she may be feeling
We have her on a morphine drip and we'll keep increasing the dosage as she shows any signs of pain
see
Can she understand me
At this point, probably not
She has so much morphine in her,  doubt she can even recognize you
But you never know
Actually, in cases like this, where the end is inevitable,  recommend that we increase the dosage on the morphine drip at an accelerated rate
There's no point in making this last longer than it has to
Whatever you think is best
The doctor nods, then walks into the hospital room where, we see now, Ed's  is lying in a hospital bed, hooked up to a digital
She is old, but looks older - she's been through chemotherapy and radiation and they have all taken their toll
She stares at Ed with confused and desperate eyes
It is hard to tell if she is looking at him or not
The doctor, at the door, has a few words with the , who then looks into the room
Ed sits next to his mother and takes her hand
She stares at him
The nurse comes in and pushes a button on the digital
Ed watches the  numbers on the digital  go up
The nurse smiles an attempt at comfort, then leaves the room
Mother reacts to the higher dosage of morphine
Her eyes get wider and more delirious
She sits up a little and tenses her muscles
She lets go of Ed's hand and starts moving her arm up and down
She starts shouting something
At first, it is completely unintelligible, but slowly, it becomes clearer
'
'
'
Ed stands up and backs away
He backs out of the hospital room as his mother continues to scream
Ed backs into the hallway, which is now blackness
As he backs away, another noise starts to echo around him
banging
loud banging is coming from upstairs
Ed backs away and then runs upstairs
- As Ed opens the basement door, he sees that it is bright daylight again
Ed opens the front door and before he can react, a fist hits him hard in the face
Ed falls to the ground, next to a pile of letters that has been dropped through the slot in the door
walks in, wearing a track suit
George, 35, is a stronger man than Ed
He is better looking, too, or, at least, younger
He has a genuine honesty about him, like a big boy
It is this boyish quality that makes his anger seem uncontrollable
You son of a bitch
Get up
Ed staggers to his feet
He tries to get a swing in at George, but George grabs him by the collar, hits him again, then throws him over the coffee table
Ed hits the phone and the answering machine on the way down
When Ed doesn't say anything, George starts searching around the house
(
) Ed can hear George searching around in the other rooms
He gets up and sits on the couch, nursing his wounds
After a minute, George comes back into the living room
What have you done
Don't hit me again
You son of a bitch
George sits down on a chair across from Ed
You son of a bitch
What did you think would happen
Nothing
You did something
did what  always do
woke up, went to my shitty job, came home and cooked dinner for my wife, who was too busy bouncing up and down on your bedsprings to cook it herself
Not exactly what had planned for my life
The same boring shit as always
Why don't you leave
love her
'm sorry
know she's your wife
George is crying
Ed, despite himself, is moved
What
Am  supposed to feel sorry for you now
Well, won't
People think they can just carry on
They don't think that there might be consequences to their actions
You won't find sympathy here
Why don't you just leave
What did you do
didn't do anything
She didn't come home after work
George gets up and starts to leave
Don't come back here again
George stops when he hears this and turns towards Ed with and angry look on his face
He grabs Ed's collar, picks him up from the couch and slugs him hard across the head
Ed lands on the floor, stunned and not moving
swear
If  find out you did something to her, 'll kill you
Ed watches George leave and stays lying on the floor as George's car can be heard driving away outside
The telephone is lying on the floor, knocked off its cradle, just out of Ed's reach
Ed stares at it for a few seconds
It is making that beeping noise that phones make when they are off the hook too long
He slowly gets up and limps into the bathroom
He looks in the mirror
His eye is swelling up already and his lip is bruised
He washes his lip off, and then takes a towel from the bathroom
He fills the towel with ice and holds it to his head
He picks up the phone as he walks into the living room and places it on the coffee table
He sits on the couch and stares at it for a second
Then he brings the phone over to his desk and finds Derm's business card
He sits down at the desk and calls Derm
Hello
Detective
Mr Saxon
Yes
've been trying to call you
You found her
No
need to talk to you
Detective
George Simian was just over here
He hit me
Are you
think so
Do you want me to call an ambulance
don't need an ambulance
'll be right over
He hangs up the phone
He sits at the desk, resting the ice on his forehead
Then he notices something under the sofa
It grabs his attention
He gets up for a closer look
There are dust bunnies and dust under the edge of the sofa, like it hasn't been swept for a while
Ed kneels down and tries to peer under the sofa
It is dark underneath and he can't see anything
He reaches his fingers under and sweeps out a few dust bunnies
Then he reaches a little further under the sofa and sweeps out Eve's pinkie finger
He recoils at the sight of this
The finger has been neatly cut, as if by a sharp blade
Dust has clung to the clotted blood around the stump, but it is unquestionably a woman's pinkie finger
He stares at it for a second, curiously disgusted
He goes to pick it up, decides he doesn't want to touch it, then uses a tissue to pick it up
He hurries to the bathroom
He drops the finger into the toilet with the tissue and flushes it
He hurries to the edge of the couch with a sponge and cleans up the small amount of blood and dust left there
He squeezes the sponge out until it is clean, then puts it aside
He lets out a huge sigh of relief
Much of the ice has melted and the towel it was wrapped in is now soaking wet
He takes the towel into the bathroom and rings it out
Then he looks over at the toilet
The finger is still there, floating like a cigarette butt
The water is pink from the blood, the tissue is gone, but the finger floats there defiantly
He flushes the toilet again, but this time stays to watch
The water goes down, but the finger stays buoyant and won't go down
There is a knock on the front door
Ed takes a bunch of toilet paper from the roll and tosses it over the finger
He flushes again, but the tank hasn't filled up yet and, if anything, this makes it longer until it will fill up again
There is another impatient knock at the door
One second
Ed sits there waiting, listening to the toilet tank filling
The knocking outside is becoming more impatient
The tank finally fills
Ed flushes and watches
This time the paper he threw in clogs the toilet and the bowl quickly fills up with water
Ed reaches behind the toilet and turns off the water, stopping it from overflowing
He looks in the toilet and can't see the finger through the mess of toilet paper
There is another knock on the door
Ed closes the toilet lid
Ed shuts the bathroom door firmly, takes a breath, and hurries out to meet Derm
Ed answers the door
Derm comes in with two assistants,  and
Snyder is holding Ed's morning paper
Damn
You did take a couple of blows, didn't you
was just putting some ice on it
That's the best thing for it
Try to keep the swelling down
It's going to look worse tomorrow
You don't want to have a doctor examine you
It's not necessary
Mr Saxon, Officer Mazurek and Officer Snyder
They'll be assisting me
Hi
How's it going
Here
brought this in
Snyder hands Ed the newspaper
Thanks
You say it was George Simian who hit you
Yes, he did
He came barreling in here and hit me
Several times
Do you have any idea why he would come here
Because he's a fucking asshole
should say that 'm concerned that he would come here
Mr Simian has a history of violent behavior, in regards to domestic disputes
What kind of history
Nothing too serious
No felonies
But enough,  think, to warrant some concern
With your permission, 'd like to fill in a complaint report for his assault on you, and as soon as we're finished here, 'll send these two over to arrest him, assuming he can be found
You think he did something to Eve
We don't have any evidence that he's even seen your wife she left her office and disappeared
We'll be arresting him solely for his assault on you
But Eve's car
You said you found her car near his house
It does no one any good to jump to conclusions
guess  misunderstood
We're going to have to take some pictures of you for the complaint report
The pictures will be used as evidence against Mr Simian if this matter does, eventually, go to trial
Fine
Derm turns to Snyder, who has heard this conversation, and Snyder begins to take pictures of Ed
Mr Saxon
These investigations can be quite demanding, especially when experiencing the trauma of loss
Do you understand what am saying
Yes
If you feel that you need someone to talk to, at any time, there are people, sometimes victims of similar situation themselves, who are will to listen and would like to help
He hands Ed a business card which reads Human Support Services, and has some address and phone information on it
Are you aware that your wife has been having an affair
With George Simian
Yes
The
teacher
guess  should have known
Apparently your wife has been seeing him for some time
Almost a year, in fact
year
Do you consider that you and your wife have a normal relationship
don't know
Normal relationship
We get on each other's nerves, have sex a few times a year, order pizza on Fridays
We've been married for ten years
It doesn't stay rosy forever
Maybe it isn't paradise, but that doesn't mean that  don't love her
Are you having any other relationships
No
Does your wife keep a diary
No
She isn't the type
Mr Saxon
May  be frank
Yes
Please
Cases involving missing persons are not uncommon
In many cases, and that is not to say in every case, but in many cases, the results are unfortunate
My God
'm not saying that you should give up hope, but my experience tells me that you should prepare yourself for the worst
Now, having said that, we will do everything in our power to find your wife
understand
Now, it's best if we can gather as much information as possible, as quickly as possible
'm sure you understand the urgency here
Of course
It will be necessary for us to search through some of your wife's personal items
'm sure  can find whatever it is that you want
It's really in your wife's best interests if you allow us to do it
We won't disturb anything or touch anything without your permission
Alright
How about we start in the bedroom
The bedroom
Yes
Right
'll show you
Ed stands up and leads them into the bedroom
They pass by the bathroom
The gurgling noises from the plumbing echo around the hallway, and while the police don't seem to pay it any mind, Ed can definitely hear it
Ed looks around the bedroom quickly before they go in
Here you go
It's sort of a mess
Do you know where your wife keeps her credit card receipts
Yes
Sure
This way
Ed leads Derm to Eve's room, leaving the two assistants in the bedroom
' Ed goes over to Eve's writing desk and looks over the papers lying on top
Nice room
You like it
Yeah
Very Magritte
It's like a nursery
guess it is
always through it was more of a conservatory
With the piano
Right
She plays in here sometimes
It's nice
We always wanted to fix up the whole house, but, this is the only room we got to
Things always cost more than you think
Yeah,  don't know what happened
Anyway, we share a credit card, but she mostly uses her own
If someone has taken your wife, there's a chance they might have used one of her credit cards
Or she might have used it herself
Ed pulls at the locked drawer in the writing table
think she keeps the receipts in here, but  don't have a key
Derm looks at the lock
Let me try
Ed gets out of the way and Derm sits in the chair to examine the lock more closely
He presses his thumbs against the desk and breaks the wood around the lock, forcing the drawer open
There we go
could have done it if  wanted to break it
'm sure she'll understand
She won't
promise
Ed sits back down and searches through the drawer
He finds some credit card receipts and sorts through them
Detective Derm
Mazurek comes into the office carrying Sadie's sweater, which has blood all over it
Snyder follows Mazurek in and looks over Mazurek's shoulder
It was under the bed, sir
Derm takes the sweater and looks at the blood on it
Is this your wife's
No
There's blood on this sweater, Mr Saxon
Yes,  know
student
Detective, this is going to sound awkward,  guess, but a student of mine came to the house yesterday, after you were here
She was nervous,  suppose
She had a bloody nose
Why would she have been nervous
don't know, but she seemed nervous
That is awkward, isn't it
suppose it is
gave her one of my wife's sweaters to wear home
She must have left that one by accident
By accident
Under the bed
don't know
What was her name
Sadie
Sadie Crumb
Derm finds a small, printed name-tag reading Sadie Crumb sewn into the collar
Derm shows it to Mazurek and then indicates for him to go back to the bedroom
Derm shows the label to Ed
Do you have this girl's phone number
'd like to talk to her
don't think so
Maybe
Ed gets up and walks into the - - where his desk is
He searches around and quickly finds a photocopy of a hand-written list of phone numbers
should call her
Sure
Here
He hands him the phone
Derm dials the number
didn't tell her about my wife
didn't see any reason to
Derm reaches into his pocket and pulls out a roll of Tums
He takes a couple and chews them and it obviously puts a bad taste in his mouth
Could  trouble you for a glass of water
Sure
Ed walks into the - He passes by the bathroom and stops by the bedroom door
He looks into the bedroom where the officers are searching through his stuff
They find a copy of Hustler Magazine and they chuckle about it, before they notice Ed watching them
As he watches, he can hear Derm talking to Sadie
(
) Hi
May  speak to Sadie Crumb, please
This is Detective Derm of the Seattle Police Department
Can  ask you a few questions
The officers turn and stare at Ed until he leaves
Ed takes a glass from the cupboard
He takes it over to the sink and fills it with water
The tap makes enough noise so that he can't hear anything else
As Ed passes the bathroom door, the gurgling noises from the plumbing get louder
He makes sure the door is firmly shot and then brings the glass of water to Derm
Derm hangs up the phone and drinks the water
Thank you
Well
She sounded very nice
You know,  think she left her sweater under your bed on purpose
Why would she do that
So that she'd have a reason to come back
see
Derm sees an open box of Skin-( cookies
Hey
My wife loves those things
swear, she eats them by the box
think they taste like shit
know
hate them
Sometimes  think she eats them just to spite me
Detective Derm
Derm looks at Ed, then goes into the other room
Ed follows
Did you go to work today, Mr Saxon
No
guess  didn't
If you'd like,  can call the University for you and explain the situation
It might help
'm sure they would understand
don't think it's necessary
Well, the offer stands if you change your mind later
It's just that,  don't want them to know anything about all this
At least not yet
understand
They walk into the - Mazurek is holding a small, fabric-bound writing book
What's that
Looks like a diary, sir
Let's have a look
Derm looks it over, reads the last couple of entries quickly
Where'd you find this
Behind the bedside table
didn't know
We have to keep some things to ourselves, or we'd go crazy
This is your wife's handwriting
He shows him the diary
Yes
Can  look at that
Of course
Ed takes the diary and wanders into Eve's room, flipping through it as he walks
' Ed flips through the last pages of the diary
He reads for a minute
Some distant noises are coming from the neighbor's house
While we can't hear exactly what is being said, it is clear that a man is saying something funny and a woman is laughing hysterically
Ed reads for a minute until, astonished, he puts it down and looks up at Derm, who is standing in the doorway watching him
guess you never really know anyone
You didn't know that you're wife is pregnant
No
'm sorry
talked to her doctor yesterday
thought you knew
Mazurek comes up behind Derm and says something inaudibly in his ear
Is it alright if Mazurek uses the bathroom
Excuse me
The bathroom
May we use the bathroom
We might be here for a while
No
The toilet is stuffed up
Actually
Do you mind leaving
just would like to be alone
Mr Saxon
'm sorry about the intrusions into your privacy, but you must understand: my first priority is finding your wife
There is still a great deal to go over
We might want to notify the press
The press
In cases like this, when we don't have many substantial leads, getting a picture of your wife on  can be invaluably helpful
don't know if 'm comfortable with that
We still have options left, but without a thorough search of your wife's belongings, those options are extremely limited
want to be helpful, but  really don't see how, if you think she was kidnapped,  don't see how it helps you to search around our things
We don't know that she was kidnapped
We can't draw those kinds of conclusions
She could have simply decided that she needed some time alone
We have to consider every possibility
just don't see how it helps
don't want to argue with you
We're trying to help you
This is our job
understand
It is in the best interest of your wife that you let us do that job without impediment
don't want to get in the way
just would like some time alone
You can comes back tomorrow, but, please
'm very tired know it might seem irrational, but  haven't slept in a long time and this is all extremely overwhelming
Please
need to be alone
Certainly
If  could just take those receipts
Sure
Here
Take them all
The receipts are on the desk in front of him and he hands them to Derm
Derm reaches out for the diary
'd like to keep this
There are some things it may be better not to know, especially if your wife comes back
can give it to you tomorrow, if you still want it
Ed leaves the diary on Eve's writing table and walks the officers out
Mr Saxon
Is there something wrong with your answering machine
Yes
It broke when  fell on it
You haven't been answering your phone
It hasn't rung
Derm looks at the phone and sees the ringer is turned off
The ringer is off
Oh
must have turned it off
What if your wife calls
Yes
Of course
wasn't thinking
Could you please leave the phone on from now on
Yes
thought  was
Thank you
'll be calling to let you know how things go with Mr Simian
Yes
Thank you
Derm and the officers leave
Ed lets out a sigh of relief
He touches his forehead and it obviously hurts
He goes back into the bathroom
He opens the medicine cabinet and searches through the plethora of over-the-counter medicine crowding the shelves
He takes a bottle of Midol, or some other feminine pain-killer
He takes a few of them and chases them down with a handful of tap water
Then he turns to the toilet, lifts the lid and looks at the stuffed-up mess
He rolls up his sleeve and sticks his hand in the bowl
He searches around for the finger
The phone rings
He gives up searching and, with some wet toilet paper stuck to his arm, hurries to answer the phone
Ed picks up the phone
Hello
Mr Saxon
This is Mrs Mastrioni, from the Dean's office
Yes
Mr Saxon
You are supposed to call us when you plan on missing class
There were students waiting for you
Yes
know
'm just having some personal problems
Anyway, the Dean wants to see you
The Dean
Yes
Can you come in today
No
What does he want to see me about
don't know
Is it about me missing classes
It might be
What's that supposed to mean
It means that if  was the Dean, and  wanted to see you, that is what it would be about
What kind of bullshit is that
There's no need to get upset, Mr Saxon
Am  being fired
Is that it
Look,  don't know
The Dean said he wanted to see you
Well,  can't see him
Personal problems
That's right
Yes
That's too bad
Yes it is too bad
Because  know what you're trying to do
Really
What's that
You know what
Why don't you tell the Dean to go fuck himself
Mr Saxon
And you go fuck yourself too
Does this mean that you won't be coming to class tomorrow
Fuck you
Ed slams the phone down
Ed takes the bottle of Midol from the medicine cabinet and takes a few more
Then he notices a trail of pink water leading from the toilet, along the bathroom floor and into the hallway
He follows the trail
The trail leads up to the pinkie finger
Ed watches while the finger moves, inchworm-like, across the floor, toward Eve's room, leaving a wet trail behind it
Ed watches for a second while he decides what to do
He quickly grabs the finger and takes it to the kitchen sink
He drops it in the sink, pushes it down the drain and flicks the garbage disposal on
He turns the water on and leaves it running until it sounds like there is nothing left of the finger
When he turns it off, he sticks his hand in, searching for any remnants of the finger
It appears to have gone down
He takes the sponge and wets it
He wipes up the trail of the finger, following it back into the bathroom
He looks at the toilet, which is still stuffed up
Ed searches around the basement for a plunger
The basement is full of strange sounds, all ruminating from the exposed pipes
He finds a plunger among some other tools and starts back upstairs, but on his way upstairs, he finds that there is a puddle of water on the floor
He traces the source of the puddle to the pipe that was only moist before
It is now dripping slowly and a large pool of dirty water is collecting in the shallow recess of the cement floor
Ed stares into the murky, black pool
There is a knock on the door upstairs and Ed turns to answer it
- Ed answers the door and sees that it is now dark outside
stands outside
Geoffrey, 54, is a wise, patient man
He is formal and calm in his manner, but these qualities belie a warm emotional vulnerability
Physically, he is not small or weak
One gets the impression that he wasn't always so kind
Mr Saxon
Yes
Hello
My name is Geoffrey Costas
'm from Human Support Services
'm not interested
Detective Derm asked me to stop by
He hands him a business card
Ed takes the card and looks it over
You've been hit
'm fine
don't need a doctor
He tries to hand the card back
Oh, 'm not a physician
'm a psychiatrist
But 'm not here on business
This is my time off
This is a personal visit
don't understand
Human Services is a volunteer organization
We offer assistance to victims of traumatic crimes
What kind of assistance
Advice, support, a shoulder to cry on
Why would  want to cry on your shoulder
Maybe you just want someone to talk to
It can be a lonely world when those you love are taken from you
No
don't think so
Well, you have my card
If you feel like talking at another time, please feel free to call
Actually, there is something you can help me with
've been having trouble sleeping
That's understandable, under the circumstances
Is there something you can give me
You mean a prescription
You're a doctor, aren't you
Yes
can't seem to find anything strong enough
You're anxious
Yes
can't sleep
It makes me anxious
Or maybe  can't sleep because 'm anxious
don't know
How long has this been going on
long time
Weeks
Oh, yes
You must have slept some
Maybe  do
But  don't seem to get the benefits never feel rested
There just doesn't seem to be the time to relax anymore
'm always two steps behind
have to stop the thinking
The longer  stay awake, the more my thoughts become frantic, irrational
If  don't get some sleep soon, nothing is going to make any sense
see
May  come in
Yes
Come in
Geoffrey comes in and places his briefcase on the table inside
There are times when the pressures of everyday life become overwhelming
As a doctor,  notice more and more of my patients experiencing similar symptoms
'm afraid it's a sign of the times, as much as anything else
Can you help me
Like  said, 'm not here on a professional basis
Your insomnia is merely a symptom of a greater unwholesomeness
lasting treatment may be extremely hard to come by
There's very little we can hope to accomplish with pharmaceuticals alone
However, under the circumstances,  can give you something to help you sleep
Do you have health insurance
Yes, through work
Geoffrey takes a prescription pad from his briefcase and scribbles out a prescription
The prescription 'm going to write for you is expensive, so  recommend you save the receipt for your insurance company
'm sure they'll cover it
These pills are quite new
've been prescribing them to my patients who travel a great deal, for their jet lag
They will help stabilize your internal clock by chemically suppressing certain amino acids in your brain
Will it help me sleep
Oh, yes
Now, take two at night, and don't take more than six in a day
Yes
Thank you
Geoffrey shuts his briefcase and starts to leave
'm glad  could help
How about  check in on you tomorrow afternoon
Tomorrow
To see how you're doing
don't know
For what it's worth,  understand your position better than you think
Don't shut it all out
Sometimes that fragile connection to the rest of the world is all we have
sincerely hope things turn out for you
Tomorrow then
Tomorrow
Ed shuts the door behind Geoffrey
Ed works the plunger in the toilet
The water is still pink from the finger, but also might be pink from the pink toilet paper that is now broken up and mixed in with the water
He plunges the toilet a few more times and then stops to see if it is working
The water slowly goes down
He reaches behind the toilet and turns the water back on
He flushes it and it seems to be working again, albeit weakly
He sits on the edge of the bathtub and takes a breath
The water in the tub hasn't gone down, so he takes the plunger and starts to work it over the drain
After a minute, he sees that it isn't working
He reaches into the drain and pulls out a huge clump of scum-filled hair
It is repulsive to Ed
He throws it into the toilet
The water in the bathtub still hasn't gone down
He searches under the sink through an exhaustive supply of cleaning supplies
He eventually pulls out a king-size container of Drano
He reads the back of the container quickly, then pours the whole thing down the drain
He watches it for a second, waiting for it to go down
Slowly, then softly, the piano can be heard playing in the other room
Ed listens to it before following it down the hallway
The lamp on Eve's writing desk is on and it lights up the end of the hallway
The music still seems to be coming from her room
' Ed comes in and looks around the room
There is no one playing the piano, but the music continues over the rest of the scene
Ed's attention turns to the diary, which is still sitting on the desk where he left it
Ed sits in the chair and starts paging through Eve's diary
The piano continues playing
We hear Eve's voice as it must have been when she was writing
(
) More than three weeks late
Damn
'm so stupid haven't told George because 'm sure he would use this as an excuse to pressure me to leave Ed
And how can  tell Ed
There's no way he could be the father
We haven't had sex in months
He would know it isn't is
Ed flips back a few pages
As he does, the camera starts to travel around the room, passing the piano, and then a few pictures from Eve's past, then some souvenirs on a shelf
(
) Saw a movie last night with George
It was awful; just the kind of movie Ed hates
wanted to tell him about it, but couldn't
told him  was at Susie's
George loved it, of course think he likes every movie
Still, it was nice to go out on a date like that
It was fun
Now the camera has turned to the empty hallway
It slowly moves toward the bathroom
(
) Ed came home in a shitty mood and started picking a fight with me about a coffee cup  broke last week
It was the last thing  needed, today especially
Sometimes  fucking hate him
He can be such a shit
The camera pans over the glass that has Eve's lipstick on it
(
) can't believe what a jock George is
knew he worked out, but he really takes car of himself
After we had sex,  was embarrassed to let him see me naked
How could  have gotten so fat
'm going back to the gym tomorrow
've really let myself go to pot
Maybe 'll get him a softball bat for his birthday next week
The camera comes into the bathroom and passes over all of Eve's things sitting on the back of the toilet
(
) Ed doesn't sleep anymore
He's beginning to scare me
He takes all these pills to help him sleep, but they only make it worse
And he hates me
can see it in his eyes
He blames me for everything that went wrong in his life
Maybe he's right
Maybe it is my fault
feel so guilty about George that  can't argue with him anymore
can't keep this up much longer
Fuck it
'm going to tell him about George tomorrow
He knows anyway
He must know
He's been acting so weird
Poor Ed
He used to have so much ambition
And he's so talented
just wish things had turned out better
The camera turns toward the bathtub, and focuses slowly in on the drain
few bubbles pop out from under the water and the water starts to drain out
As the camera dollies in on the drain, the last of the murky water disappears
Ed, now standing in the bathroom, strikes a match and holds it up to the diary until the corner finally catches on fire
He fans out the pages so that it will catch more
When he can't hold it anymore, he drops it into the bathtub and watches it burn
He watches it until it has burnt itself out, burning into a pile of thick, black ashes
Ed looks up at the smoke alarm
He tries to pull it down, but it is out of his reach
Ed grabs a chair from the living room and stands on it so that he can reach the alarm
He pulls the cover off the alarm and then the battery out and the alarm is finally silenced
Then he hears voices coming from outside the front door
He approaches the front door cautiously, then puts his ear up to the door and listens
The voices are muted and whispered, but Ed can still hear what is being said, although it is hard to tell who is talking
(
) No
won't
(
) You are so crazy
(
) 'm crazy
What about you
(
) Quiet
He's going to hear you
(
) So what if he hears me
Who is he, anyway
(
) God, you are being such an asshole
Ed opens the door quickly
- Sadie and Harvey freeze like caught children
, 19, looks younger than his is; his facial hair isn't capable yet of filling out his meager goatee
He seems hurt, like a spoiled child who hasn't gotten his way
What's going on
Christ
'm so sorry
Who's this
Is this him
Will you shut up
He's so old
Excuse me
Can we just go inside
Please
Ed lets Sadie inside
So that's it
You're going with him now
You really don't understand anything
You said you loved me
Jesus
Would you shut up
You are so embarrassing
Embarrassing
'll tell you what's embarrassing
You with this fucking geriatric old man
That's embarrassing
You little shit
Ed makes a move toward Harvey, but Harvey backs away quickly
Don't touch me
Let's just go in,
He'll leave
User
Stalker
Psycho
Slut
Sadie slams the door on him
Sadie stands staring at the floor
can't believe that
You know, he followed me here
He followed you
Yeah
Do you believe it
Oh my God
What happened to you
Somebody hit me
Are you alright
'm fine
Who hit you
really don't want to get into it
nearly had a heart attack when the police called me
What did they ask you
Just about me being here
About what happened
But nothing happened
That's what  told them
They found your sweater
It has blood all over it
You're kidding
You left it under the bed
Oh, yeah
Damn
don't know why  do things like that
What if my wife had found it
Oh
Is she here
No
Look, Sadie
don't want you to get the wrong idea
Don't be mad
It's just that  worry too much
You didn't come to class again
And you said you would
started getting all these ideas
called you, but nobody answered
meant to bring your wife's sweater back, but  forgot it
Actually, 'm glad you're here
Can you do me a favor
Sure
Anything
have to get a prescription filled
No problem
Ed finds the prescription on his desk
'd go myself, but 'm expecting a phone call
Sure
He hands her the prescription
There's a twenty-four pharmacy on Market
know the one
go there all the time
It's like my second home
'll give you my credit card
Ed finds his wallet and hands her the card
'll be back in a minute
Thank you
Sadie skips out the door and Ed shuts it behind her
Ed turns on the shower, washing the ashes down the drain
After he's watched them go down, he takes a sponge and cleans off the burnt mark in the tub as best he can
He turns the shower on, rinsing it out
He turns the shower off and hears the phone is ringing
Ed picks up the phone
Mr Saxon
Detective Derm
Yes, hi
wanted to let you know that we've taken Mr Simian into custody
understand
We found him at his place of work
At the school
Yes
We arrested him there
He'll come up for arraignment tomorrow morning and then, as far as  can tell, he'll probably be released on his own recognizance
see
It's just standard procedure, but  thought 'd keep you informed
Yes
Thank you
Did he say anything about Eve
Try to rest, Mr Saxon
We have a lot of ground to cover tomorrow
will
Thank you
Good night
Ed hangs up the phone
Then he hears some sounds coming from Eve's room
' Ed takes a few steps into Eve's room
He traces the noises to the window and looks out at the neighbor's house
The light is on in the neighbor's window, and there are some vague shadows moving around on the closed curtain
As the noises get louder, it soon becomes clear that the neighbors are having sex
Ed peers out at the light in the window, listening to the woman's increasing moans
The woman seems to be in some sort of painful, orgasmic delight
In other words, it mostly sounds like she is having a good time, but there should be a growing suspicion that not all is right
(
) Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Ed backs slowly away from the window
He hears someone knocking on the front door
Ed opens the door and Sadie comes in holding a colorful paper bag
Thank you
Ed takes the bag from Sadie and goes into the kitchen
Sadie follows him in
Ed opens the pills quickly and swallows three of them with a glass of water
Those pills cost a lot
They must be strong
They're sleeping pills
've been having trouble sleeping
You must have anxiety
can never get to sleep when 'm anxious
am anxious
Yes
Sadie takes some other stuff out of the bag
One of the items is an individually wrapped Skin-( fat-free cookie, chocolate, chocolate chip
got you some peroxide and stuff
And a cookie
haven't eaten today
You put it all on my credit card, right
Actually,  paid for it
They wouldn't take your card
Why not
They said you hadn't paid your bill, on the phone
They called the credit card people when it didn't go through
Damn
Well, 'll pay you back
It's
charged it to my Dad
don't even pay the bill
No, those pills are expensive
And my insurance will cover it anyway
Pay me back later, then
Really, it's
Are you sure
It's fine
swear
Sadie looks at the cuts on his face
Your face must hurt
No
don't seem to feel anything
It's nasty
Sadie takes a closer look
Here
Sit down
She sits Ed down at the kitchen table, under a light, and sits across from him, then takes the peroxide and some cotton swabs she bought at the pharmacy and starts to dress his wounds
've never been hit before
Me neither
It's not so bad, really
It's humbling, but  like the effect it seems to have on people
It seems to make them more compassionate
There's a competitive market for suffering in the world
It's difficult to stand out from the handicapped and the homeless and the politically oppressed
Sometimes a little advertising helps remind people that you're a human being
It does make you look sort of cute, in a pathetic kind of way
Sadie
Are you really married
What
You think  just made it up
don't know
Some people just say they're married, you know, because maybe they think it's more respectable or something
'm not one of those people
didn't mean to imply anything
It's just that you act sort of weird
act weird
Not weird, really
Worried,  guess
Secretive
Like you're worried  might find out something about you
You don't want to get involved with my problems
Maybe  do
Believe me, you don't
didn't mean to pry
Well, maybe  did
'll just put a band-aid on it
Would you like a drink
'm going to have one
1tt1He finds a bottle of wine
You're not supposed to mix wine with sleeping pills
It increases the amount of medicine that's absorbed into the bloodstream
1tt1Ed searches for a corkscrew and starts to open the bottle
need all the help  can get
It's dangerous
It's just wine
'll only have a glass
1tt1He offers her some and she nods
He pours her a glass
Sadie takes her glass into the living room
Ed downs his glass of wine and refills it quickly before following her
1tt1She sits down at his desk
Are you working on anything new
No
don't write anymore
Why not
just don't have the time
have to work all day
Time just slips by
know what you mean
There's not enough time in the day
Not as much as there used to be
There used to be more
Yes
Before  had to work there was plenty of time
But you had all that stuff published
Sure, but it didn't pay very much
had a lot of debts from school that needed to be paid off
And then, credit cards
And then  got married, bought a house
Life comes with all these expenses
And poetry just doesn't pay
thought working at the University would at least give me summers off
Doesn't it
Not really
No
1tt1There is a knock on the door
The idea that someone else might see them together makes it awkward for both of them
1tt1Ed freezes for what seems like a long time; long enough for whoever it is to knock again
better see who that is
Yeah
1tt1Ed goes over to the door and opens it cautiously
It is Eve's friend,
Hi, it's me
Oh, hi Susie
1tt1She is about to walk in, when Ed blocks her way
She can see Sadie sitting at Ed's desk holding a glass of wine
Eve's not here
Oh
She came back though, didn't she
No, she didn't
Oh no
Can  come in
- 1tt1Ed, rather than let her in, pushes her outside and shuts the door behind her
No
'm busy right now
called the police
What did they say
They're working on it
You can call them if you want
1tt1Ed finds Derm's card in his pocket and hands it to her
Aren't you worried
Of course 'm worried
'm just working right now
This girl is one of my students
She wanted some help on an assignment
She doesn't know anything about Eve being missing
What happened to you
George Simian hit me
George
You know him
It figures
1tt1Susie starts crying
Ed stares at her helplessly, then goes back inside
Wait
1tt1Ed stops
Can  come back later
It's late
just took some sleeping pills
haven't slept much since this all started
Why don't you come back tomorrow
Tomorrow
Good night, Susie
Ed walks back in, leaving Susie standing on the porch
- Ed waits by the door until he hears her footsteps walking away outside
Sadie stands up, looking nervous
2t2Is that your wife
2t2No
It was a friend of hers
2t2I should go
2t2No
Why
2t2You must be tired
Those pills must be working
2t2I don't think they're working at all
2t2Still
You're married, right
2t2Yeah, but, please don't go
Please
Time has a way of slowing down when you're around
2t2Really
For me, too
2t2So you'll stay
2t2If you want me to
Ed comes over to her and kisses her
2t2Can  ask you something
2t2What
2t2Do you think my writing is good
2t2You've done some good work
2t2Yeah
minus good
2t2I told you,  was in a bad mood when  graded that
2t2I guess so
She is unresponsive at first
(to herself) 2t2What am  doing
They kiss for a minute, then Ed slips his hand under the back of Sadie's sweater
She kisses him again
Sadie turns the lights off and we can only see by the light coming in from the hallway
Ed lies on the bed and Sadie lies next to him, under the covers
Ed slips his hand under the back of her sweater and fiddles with her bra while they kiss
The gurgling sound starts up again, and while Sadie doesn't notice, or doesn't hear it, it becomes increasingly distracting to Ed
He looks to the bathroom where the noise is coming from
The camera focuses in on the drain
The water in the bathtub starts rising again
Sadie breaks away from him, sits up and takes off her sweater
Ed takes off his shirt
Ed's kisses move around the side of her neck
As he reaches her ear, he looks up and notices Eve's clothes sitting on the chair
The water is rising slowly, but we can see solid stuff (the ashes from the diary are clearly part of the muck) seeping out of the drain with the water
It is a cloudy, dark, disgusting water which probably stinks too
Ed is trying to concentrate on Sadie, but he notices the closet door is open and there are some dresses blowing around inside
And the noise from the bathroom is getting louder
He turns Sadie onto her back, turning himself away from the closet
His kisses run down her chest until he gets to her jeans
He unbuttons her jeans and starts to pull them off, kissing as he goes
Ed has taken her pants off, but his passion and enthusiasm has faded, and he stops and stares off into space, towards the bathroom
He is spooked
2t2What's wrong
He looks down and sees Sadie staring at him
2t2I don't know
Maybe it's those pills
don't know
2t2Just relax
Lie back
Sadie gently pushes him back and starts to go down on him
Ed get more uptight
2t2No
Please
Just stop
She keeps trying until Ed is forced to push her away
2t2It's just not working
2t2Alright
'm sorry
Sadie turns away
She's upset
2t2Maybe  should go
2t2No
Please, don't
It's my fault
Please
Don't go
2t2Damn, 'm so stupid
2t2No, it's me
Please
2t2This was a mistake
Sadie gets up and puts on her shirt
She grabs the rest of her clothes and goes into the living room
Ed stares after her, listening to her finish dressing herself and then leave
The clock next to the bed is ticking loudly and the sound of the ticking continues of the next few scenes, as indicated
Ed pours a few more pills into his hand, swallowing them with some wine from the bottle
Ed looks at the bathtub, which is full of the murky water
He picks up the plunger, which is still by the toilet, and starts working it on the drain
More stuff is coming up, making the water darker, but as he relaxes the plunger, the water doesn't go down
If anything, the gurgling sound is louder
He works the plunger some more, more vigorously and then, again, relaxes it and watches the drain hopefully
The gurgling noise seems closer and the water still does not go down
Then he hears something hit the front door
Ed opens the front door and picks up the newspaper which has just been thrown
He puts it with the other newspapers, which have piled up in their plastic wraps on his desk
He comes back into the bathroom and looks at the bathtub
He puts the plunger over the drain and works it much harder and, this time, after a few seconds, there is a loud knock in the pipes, as if he hit something
He takes the plunger away and watches the drain
Suddenly, a large air bubble bursts out of the drain
He watches, but the water shows no sign of draining
Then, slowly, blood starts to leak into the tub from the drain
Ed is naturally terrified by this
He watches until it is clear that it is blood and not just more gook
He puts plunger back on the drain and pumps it a few more frantic times
More blood seeps out of the drain
He seems to be making the problem worse
He shuts the shower curtain and backs out of the bathroom
He spills the pills on the kitchen counter and counts them quickly
There are about ten left
He pours them into his mouth and swallows the rest of the wine
Then the ticking stops
Ed looks at a clock on the wall
The second hand has stopped
He hears voices in the other room
' He looks out of the window in Eve's room
He sees that the light in the neighbor's window is on
The couple next door are having another argument, but this one is much more intense than the last
(
) 2t2Why do you care
You don't care
You know nothing about me
hate you
Stay away from me
'll scream
am not screaming now
You think you're the only one
Yes,  do
You never do that
You do not
You never do anything
You think that nothing's wrong
You think we live in paradise
This is what  think of this fucking house
There is the sound of things breaking
(
) '
'
' ' This ends with a loud, terrifying shriek
It seems to echo around the room as Ed watches
Then the voices stop
Ed watches the window and sees a featureless man stick his head through the curtains to see if anybody is listening
Then he closes the window and curtains
The phone rings in the other room
He hurries to answer the phone
While he is on the phone, a new sound is coming from the bathroom
It is like the gurgling sound, but also subtly different
Hello
Mr Saxon
Yes
It's Detective Derm
'm sorry to call you so late, but  thought you would want to hear this
Yes
'm afraid  have some bad news
What is it
It's your wife
We've found her
You found her
We found her body
Her
Yes, sir
In the woods, near George Simian's house, where we found her car
'm afraid she's dead
Ed drops the phone
He walks trance-like into the hallway
He follows the noise into the - The noise coming from the bathroom now sounds more human, like a baby gurgling
As Ed walks into the bathroom, he can see that there is something in the bathtub
The shower curtain is closed, but behind it, there is some sort of body moving
Ed pulls the curtain back
He reveals a baby, just born, lying in the tub
Most of the murky water has drained and left a dirty ring around the tub
The  is a newborn, except that its eyes are maybe larger than they would be
The Baby is also
It's immense frame fills the bathtub
It is naked (it's a boy)
Ed watches with amazement
The baby looks incredibly real, except for its size
The stare at each other for a minute
The baby looks a lot like George Simian
It has his eyes
Other than this, it behaves like a baby
It is lying on its back, gurgling peacefully with his feet in the air and his left hand gripping the shower curtain
The baby reaches out for Ed lovingly
Ed backs away
Seeing this, the baby starts crying
Ed, panicking, approaches the baby
It is still crying
Ed reaches out to touch it
He touches its arm and the baby's crying starts to subside
The baby moves with typical, quick, chaotic movements that, because of the baby's size, are almost threatening
Ed puts his hand in the baby's hand
The baby grips it as baby's do, but this baby's hand is about the size of Ed's
The baby stops crying and returns to its curious gurgling
Ed tries to pull his hand back, but the baby won't let go
The baby, it seems, is incredibly strong
Ed pulls harder
He still can't get the baby to let go
Ed tries to pry the baby's fingers off, and this time manages to get his hand out of the baby's grip
But as soon as he does, the baby starts crying again
He backs out into the hallway
Ed is in a panic
The baby's cries echo around him as he backs away from the bathroom
Ed finds himself in the kitchen
He looks at his hands which are covered with bloody muck from the tub
He washes them off in the sink
He looks over at the kitchen knife which has been drying in the dish rack
Ed walks slowly, purposefully to the bathroom
The crying baby gets louder as he approaches
He comes into the bathroom, but in the tub, instead of the baby, there is a grown man's body
It is Ed, staring up at himself from under the water
We only see a very tight shot of 's head and part of his neck
His head is under water and he looks up, unable to move
We then see the reverse shot of this and it is also of Ed, so that Ed is, in effect, looking up at himself through the cloudy water
The baby cries continue, although the baby is no longer in the scene
From Bathtub Ed's point of view, we see the other Ed takes the kitchen knife and lean forward and to the right, off-camera
Bathtub Ed, who can move his eyes, tries to look to his arm, where the other Ed is cutting
Soon, blood starts to mix with the water, diffusing over Bathtub Ed's face
The blood also diffuses over Bathtub Ed's , as he looks up at the other Ed cutting him
When the other Ed is finished cutting, Bathtub Ed sees him put the knife aside and then reach down, off-camera
After a short struggle, the other Ed pulls up Bathtub Ed's severed arm and slips it into a garbage bag he has already prepared
The blood from Bathtub Ed's cut fills the water with dark blood, turning the film red
The red dissolves into a pool of blood that is in the hallway
Ed, with a bucket and sponge, is cleaning pockets of blood from the floor and walls
He is crying while he does this
He squeezes the sponge for the last time, then inspects the hallway as closely as he can, searching for any spots he might have missed
Then he picks up the bucket and takes it into the bathroom
He dumps the water from the bucket into the bathtub
The water is pink and dirty
He sits down on the edge of the bathtub and watches the water go down the drain
He stares at the drain in a trance until he hears a knock on the front door
He turns to listen to it in the other room
- As he opens the bathroom door, he sees that the sun is shining in from the living room
Geoffrey stands patiently outside as Ed opens the door
He carries his briefcase and looks dressed for work
His appearance is a stark contrast to the half-dressed, blood-shot Ed
Hi
wanted to see how you were getting along
Getting along
have to say, you don't look well
'm not well
Have you slept
don't know
Maybe
It's difficult to tell
have these lapses, but 'd hardly call it sleep
Did you take the pills
The pills are fucking useless
But you took them
Yes
see
May  take your blood pressure
, fine
Geoffrey comes in and places his briefcase on the table
He takes a stethoscope and the rest of his blood pressure kit and starts to take Ed's blood pressure
feel like a lab rat
Like one of those lab rats they drug up and study
You know what  mean
You feel like a rat
They put them in a maze and they give them shocks and drugs and they see what they do
They try to prod them in the direction they want them to go
Try to relax
feel like a rat who took all the turns, took all the drugs, went down the right path and then, when  got to the end, they shocked me anyway, right up the sphincter, like it was all just a big joke
guess they thought 'd be too drugged up to notice
It's been a few days, hasn't it, since your wife disappeared
Days
Yes
guess
Has there been any word from the police
Haven't you talked to them
No
But if you'd like me to,  will, on your behalf
They know me and 've been through this before
With others
With others, and myself
My wife was taken from me about three years ago
What happened
It was a similar situation to yours
The police found her car in the parking lot of a mall
They found her body about a week later in some woods nearby
She was murdered
Yes
Did they ever catch the man who did it
No
Why would somebody do that
Sometimes a man, when faced with his own problems or inadequacies, takes it out on someone weaker than themselves
'm sorry
Do you feel responsible at all for your wife's disappearance
Why
People often blame themselves for events that they have no control over, especially when the events seem so random and cruel
Action leading up to tragedy tend to become more significant
Details weigh on the conscience
do seem to be having problems with my conscience
see
Do you think that's why  can't sleep
Could be
Is there anything you can give me
prescription
For your conscience
Of course not
Then what's the point
There are other ways  can be of help
shoulder to cry on
Would you like me to call the police
There might be some news
The police called last night, late last night
They found Eve's body
Oh, no
They found her buried in the woods, near where they found her car
'm sorry
didn't know
Geoffrey's watch alarm goes off
He looks at the time and then, habitually takes a shiny silver pillbox from his pocket
He takes two pills out
Excuse me
never knew  could feel so alone
Geoffrey takes a thermos from his briefcase, pours some hot tea into the lid and swallows the pills with a mouthful of tea
He hasn't called since last night
No
It's been a while
Why don't you let me call him
Maybe there's some news
When Ed doesn't object, Geoffrey takes his address book from his briefcase, along with a cellular phone and dials the number
Detective Derm, please
Hi, Charlie, it's Geoffrey
'm over at Ed Saxon's house
Yeah
He was hoping to get some information on his wife
Uh-huh
Well, he said you called him last night and told him that you had found her body
Uh-huh
see
In the woods, near where you found her car
don't know
Yes
Well,  did give him something to help him sleep
Right
Yes
Then Geoffrey turns away from Ed and says a few words quietly, so that Ed can't hear
Then
Yes
Yes
'll tell him
Yes
Bye
Geoffrey hangs up and turns back to Ed
What
He says he never called you last night
What
He told me to tell you to wait here for him; that he's coming over
don't understand
It is possible that you did fall asleep, that you dreamed the phone call
have to say that  was surprised when you said you hadn't slept
Those pills are very effective
The pills
Yes
Maybe
Still, this is better, isn't it
mean, now there's still a chance
Your wife could still be
There's still hope
Yes
Hope
But why is he coming over here
He said he had some questions to ask you
What questions
He didn't say
If he had some questions to ask me, he could have asked me on the phone
Calm down, Mr Saxon
Why did you turn away from me when you were talking to him
What did you say
said you were very tired and anxious and that you seemed to be under a great deal of stress
You're lying
have no reason to lie
Don't you
No
Why do you think 'm lying
Because you're scared
Geoffrey does look scared
He has quickly packed up his briefcase
Mr Saxon
Please
understand you're under a lot of stress
You don't understand anything
came here to help you
Then help me
Please
've done all  can now
'm sorry
can't do any more
But, you'll come to see me again, won't you
No
don't think  will
Geoffrey leaves
Ed shuts the door
The phone rings
Ed picks it up
Hello
Is this Ed
George
What did you do to Eve
didn't do anything
know you did
saw her before she left work
We met in the parking lot, like we always did
She told me she was leaving you
She was going to tell you when she got home
You don't know anything about it
Yes,  do
know you
Eve talks about you
She tell me things
What things
know about the fights you have
She's my wife
We fight sometimes
That's bullshit
know what kind of a son of bitch you can be
She's told me
What don't you tell it to the police
did
You think she was some sort of angel
She was cheating on me
love her
loved her
Ed listens to George break down
'm sorry
There is a long pause
It's not enough
George hangs up
The bathroom is completely clean
There is no sign of any of the activity from before
Ed finds the bottle of prescription sleeping pills
It is empty
He takes a couple of Midol and swallows them dry
Ed sits down at his desk
He looks over the papers on his desk
Sadie's is on top
He looks it over
The phone rings and he picks it up
Hello
Hello
Sadie
wanted to apologize
No
Don't apologize
It was me
shouldn't have left like that
don't know what came over me
It was understandable, under the circumstances
really wanted you to like me
wonder if you'll still feel the same way when you find out what kind of person  really am
'll still keep your poem on my wall
Yes
think it's a beautiful poem
really do
Are you still there
Yes
wish things had turned out better
She hangs up
Ed stays on the phone, listening until the dial tone clicks back in
Then Ed hears a car pull up outside
He follows some quiet footsteps as they walk up to the front door
He sees the door knob turn quietly in the door
The door is locked
Ed approaches the door slowly, but suddenly, there is a crash against it
Someone is trying to knock the door down
The door is strong, and doesn't open, but the wall around it shakes
After a few seconds, there is another crash against the door
This time the wall shakes so much that Eve's picture, which hangs by the door, almost falls off its nail
Ed looks out of the window
The window is positioned facing the street, but not the porch, so he cannot see who it is, but he can see a car parked out front, with the door still open
Inside the car, there is a softball glove lying on the passenger seat, along with something that George Simian was wearing when we last saw him
George crashes against the door again
This time Eve's picture falls off the wall
It hits the ground and smashes, spreading broken glass around her picture
The door is starting to loosen around the lock and jamb
Ed backs into the hallway
As he passes the bathroom, he can hear the gurgling sounds from the plumbing starting up again
Ed backs into the kitchen
He searches around, quickly finding the kitchen knife
He grabs it out of the dish rack and starts walking toward the front door
There's another bang on the door
Ed passes slowly through the hallway, watching the door, holding the knife in front of him
The gurgling sounds in the bathroom are deep and resonant, echoing out of the drain, around the bathroom and into the hallway
There is another hard crash against the door, which breaks the jamb
The door is only being held on by the splinters around the lock and George starts kicking the door with his foot
Ed backs into the basement door
He opens it and goes into the- He hurries down the stairs into the darkness of the basement
The pipes surround Ed with hysterical, thick, watery sounds
There are metallic creaks and strains which reverberate around the walls of the basement as the pipes seem to expand and contract
couple of inches of dark, dirty water have collected on the floor and Ed's feet get wet as he steps off the last stair
Ed finds a place to hide in the shadows behind some boxes
He stares up, as he hears the door breaking open upstairs and someone walking into the living room
With his eyes, he follows the footsteps as they search the apartment
Ed has hidden under a large pipe, which is dripping drops of dirty water onto his face
In the darkness of the basement, the color of the water is unclear, but as he wipes some onto his fingers, he can see it is murky and dark
The basement door opens slowly, and from the light upstairs, Ed can see the silhouette of George Simian standing with a softball bat
Ed grips onto his knife and watches as George comes down the stairs, step by step
The water keeps dripping on the top of Ed's head, running down the side of his face, but he holds still
Ed watches George come down the stairs
George reaches the bottom and steps into the shallow water
He peers cautiously into the shadows
He starts walking toward Ed
Ed withdraws as much as he can into his corner until he is in complete darkness
He watches George approaching him and he slowly raises his knife
George raises his softball bat
He takes a few more steps up to Ed, but then steps blindly past him and into a deep, dark shadow
Ed watches him disappear into the shadow and then, makes his move
He rushes into the shadow with his knife raised and both he and George are engulfed in darkness
After a few seconds, Ed emerges from the shadow
He drops the knife into the water at his feet
As he does, blood runs out of the shadow, mixing with the water in the basement floor
Ed walks slowly upstairs
The noises around him in the basement are now at their loudest
Ed takes a long look at himself in the mirror
He is wet with blood and dirt
He opens the medicine cabinet and finds the sleeping pills he was using before
He opens the bottle and empties it into his hand
There are only about five pills left
He takes the two toothbrushes from a toothpaste-crusty glass and fills it with water
He takes the pills
Unsatisfied, he searches through the rest of the medicine cabinet
The selection, though not particularly toxic, is a good representation of standard, over-the-counter pills and tonics
He finds the Midol and takes the last few from the bottle
There is a bottle of cold medicine which he finishes off
He drinks down a nearly full bottle of pink diarrhea medicine
He finds a bottle of multi-vitamins and takes a handful of those
As he finishes each one, he drops the empties onto the floor of the bathroom
When he stops, he notices blood seeping out of the bathtub drain
It is pure, thick, dark blood
He backs away into the hallway
Ed backs into the wall and then, losing strength in his legs, lowers himself to the floor
He keeps watching the bathtub
Piano music starts to seep through the gurgling noises
Ed turns towards Eve's room
On the other side of the house, outside the broken door, Ed can hear Derm's car pull up
Ed watches the living room as Derm comes in carefully, flanked by Mazurek and Snyder
Derm comes over to Ed and kneels down in front of him
Ed looks up at him helplessly
It wasn't me
Derm looks at Ed's hands, which are covered in blood
It wasn't me
Ed watches Derm looking at him
Then he notices, behind Derm, blood seeping over the rim of the bathtub
Ed turns to Eve's room, where the piano can still be heard
