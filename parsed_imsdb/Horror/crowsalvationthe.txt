He didn't order that

Despite himself, Alex looks up

Alex staring at the photo, taped to the wall
What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace

No parents, no dough

Unable to touch, but he reaches for them, a gesture of solidarity
Mercer catches up with the group, flanking Alex cell-side
Alex drops his hand, cut off even from that

The warden steps to the side of the room, nods to the executioner who lifts a  off a large switch
The New Arrival pulls his shirtsleeve back over his forearm, exposing a scar for Alex,  , an odd zigzag pattern of raised welts, a pattern deliberately formed of skin
The Executioner throws the switch

Cruel, who's to say, but it sure was unusual

That, my friend, is a deterrent
They  past, Alex's charred remains visible a moment, parts of the helmet fused on his face and head, his body convulsed in a pugilistic attitude

Mercer opens the locker door

The body hits the open door
Convulsed as it is, the body won't really fit through the door
Whoops
The sound of something breaking as the  Alex into the cubby hole

Why do they even autopsy these guys
Cause of death is pretty fucking obvious
The door slams shut

He secures it to the lid of the case already containing the neatly packed chess set
Closes it
Bows his head

They look up as the Randalls emerge shaken from the Witness entrance
He speaks softly to Erin, who's leaning against him
(to Erin) 'll meet you atthe car, honey
She continues on and Randall crosses to the cops, who wait patiently to see what he'll say
Finally
We all wish this had ended better
Sir
Randall nods
Like that's all anyone could say
As he walks off the Cops fall into easy chatter

Just an eye, peering

His body looks less misshapen now
He looks at his arms, hands, no longer burned

His body miraculously , covered by shredded clothing

He slowly approaches the mirror on unsteady feet

Tommy's wife returns, holding a fifteen month old
Alex unfolds "The List," passes it to Tommy, blank side up
Write down their names
All of them
But Tommy takes a look at "The List" and flips it over
" " Tommy points to the Police Witness list
Dutton, Erlich, Larkin, Toomey
You already got 'em
Right here
These cops said the needed an eyewitness, or Corvis would walk

All clear now
He laughes gently at the sound of  approaching, still blocks away
: - toward the by now familiar Mystery Man, bent over his work at the table across the room
lineup of short (2") rods
One selected with a pair of surgical forceps, through a hole in human flesh, raising a considerable welt
Some bleeding
As the man reaches for a cotton ball, he notices an empty among the taxidermy specimens
Marked "Corvus brachyrhynchos
" He scans the table, searching, then throws up his hands, shielding his face as a Crow flies out of the darkness, right at him
The man turns toward Camera but we never see his face as the Crow wheels mid-air, flying past him a second time
As the Crow flies up and out a  , the man stands, hands on the desk
on the man, on
of raised welts on the underside of his forearm, in high relief under the Draftsman's lamp

"Dutton, Philip" with a picture of the same face   working a bad comb- over in the rearview mirror
, almost sixteen, dressed for nightlife, sees Dutton primping in her rearview mirror
He's getting out now
Oh no
She jostles her friend , passed out in the front passenger seat, trying to rouse her
No luck
motions and Tracy buzzes down the window
(') Anything wrong
Let's hope not
License and registration please
Tracy tries hard to keep her smile going as she looks through her purse
Not finding anything
(') What's with your friend there
She's
sick
(off Dutton) Actually she never had Mai Tais before
But you, you've had them
Not tonight
Honest
Tracy paws through her purse some more
Vamping
If you had a license,  bet 'd have seen it by now
How old are you
Fifteen
Look, 'll tell you the truth
Jannie drove us and was supposed to drive us back, she has a license, but  mean
look at her
Dutton leaves that dangling
Circles around to the passenger side
(') (whisper to Jannie) Get up, get up
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 27
Dutton opens Jannie's door, leans in, slides a hand between her slightly parted legs
Dutton smiles at Tracy
Why don't you get out
High overhead
Tracy steps out of the car
Dutton shuts the passenger door, points
Tracy moves behind the Seville
Dutton closes in
She's getting very nervous
You want me to walk a straight line
want you
to bend over
Look, can  just call a cab
What did  say
Tracy bends over the car trunk
Dutton eases her feet apart with the tip of his boot then pulls out his , uses it to lift her tiny skirt slowly up over her butt
As he does, she stands back up, shakes her head "no
" (') Maybe 'll ask your friend
Tracy's frantic, about to call out as Dutton moves to the passenger door, opens it and
-  sits in the passenger seat now
Jannie shunted inward
(mimicking Dutton) want you
to bend over
Officer Dutton
Dutton pulls his 9MM  on Alex
Where'd you come from
Out of the car
Now
With insolent slowness, Alex finishes writing
" " a red line drawn through Dutton's name
gets out of the car
Dutton  the door and Janie stirs, coming to
At least a bit
(') Hands on the car
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 28
Question
These hands
Alex advances on Dutton
You're dead, ditch weed
Dutton's finger squeezes the trigger
The shot blows Alex back at the Seville passenger window
Slumped face against the car
Omigod, omigod
Jannie's head pops up inside the car
She  at
'  Alex right in her face, nice and dead
Dutton lowers his gun
Tracy in a panic
Suddenly, Alex opens his eyes, smiles
Face distorted against the glass
She screams again
You're up
wheels around, wrenches Dutton's wrist, vise gripped
Dutton's gun falls to the ground
(') Ladies
Drive carefully
Tracy rushes to the driver side
(') You might want to call 911
Report an officer down
Tracy  off leaving Dutton in shock
That was a fucking hollow point
guess it's true
Guns don't kill people
Alex draws the --the murder weapon--from his costume
(') Think maybe knives do
Keep that thing away from me
This is not just some "thing
" It's   zero zero five
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 29
You're the skel broke into the evidence room
The knife moves and
Alex yanks the sleeve off Dutton's uniform, revealing a
(') Fuck
What do you want
scar
On the arm
Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car
There's no scar, you freak
The Corvis kid made it up
Alex glitches, hearing this a second time, then  Dutton into a wall with a great  of trash cans
Alex all over him, holding Dutton's head firmly in his two hands, like he could crush it in an instant
He was innocent
You framed him
You
And Erlich
And Larkin
And Toomey
What do you think, Officer Dutton
An eye for an eye
Alex's thumbs inch toward Dutton's eyes, grazing Dutton's eyelids now and a wild thing happens
'   Dutton's Nightstick lifts Lauren's skirt
Then flashs of a bloodsoaked struggle, Lauren's death
And the surprise
of a shot fired
Alex thrown by this
Relaxes his grip on Dutton
(') You were there
All four of you
Dutton kicks him off, smashes a garbage can over Alex's back then pulls a  - from an ankle holster
(') You killed her
saw it
Bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg
If she' just acted like a girl nothing would have happened
(then) So you're right, spooky
Happy
Alex barely slowed by the shot, advancing, Dutton starting to panic
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 30
Alex keeps coming, right up to the gun
Pointed right at his face, then
Alex flips it around,  the gun in Dutton's mouth
He couldn't talk if he wanted to

Madden continues cautiously toward -   - The door is cracked open
Madden moving very quietly now, scowling as he peers through the slight opening
Three guys and whirring machines counting stacks of money
Guns on the tabletops, in holsters, out of reach
The door flies open
Police
moment of panic as the guys bent over the machines freeze
Raise their hands, slowly turn
Then lower their hands
You fuck
Don't do that
It's Erlich, Larkin and Toomey
Three cops we met at the execution
Erlich's cane nearby
How's the month end
Oh yes
Never been better
Where's Dutton
Probably parked near some high school with a hardon
Fuck never showed
Anyone at all curious why
Erlich, Larkin and Toomey exchange a look
Madden goes to one of the money counters and grabs
tossed violently at the ceiling
Larkin and Toomey scramble as the bills flutter down like leaves, picking them up
(') You leave the door open with two hundred strangers out there
What's it take for you guys to learn a goddamn lesson
No one saw anything, Mad
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 32
You know why Dutton's not here
Rigor mortis
He's dead
The Three exchange looks
(') One shot to the head, then fifty three stab wounds with a six inch blade
Any deja vu here
Think Corvus knife, missing from the evidence room
Since when
Since last night
As usual, you're right on top of things
It was supposed to end when Corvis died
Remember
The kid no one would miss
Don't look at me, asshole
Hey,  didn't kill anybody
Back off
mean it
Shut up
Erlich and Larkin settle down
(') Crime scene's a goddamn clusterfuck
Every reporter in town's trying to get a look at Dutton's body suggest we get a line on this before someone else does
Who'd give a shit about Corvis at this point
Kid didn't have a friend in the world even when he was alive
can think of one
Erlich and Madden share a look
On the same wavelength
Erlich picks up his weapon off the table

#1 - large   marked off by tape, Dutton's cruiser where he left it
Several other cruisers nearby, lights flashing
An ambulance, stretcher being unloaded now
the one we've seen before, Barbara Gonzalez frontman, speaking into a mic, too far away for us to hear
- '  - on a
Gonzalez audible now
rumors multiply as officials refuse to confirm or deny reports of multiple, multiple stab wounds
Gonzalez   as
Dad
Come in here
The  of footsteps racing down the hall
What is it
The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car
Randall riveted by the  now
They're moving him now, body covered
It would appear that thirty seven year old Phillip Dutton is dead in the line of duty
the Newsteam and Gonzalez  back by running defense for the stretcher
Gonzalez grabs for the sheet covering the body and
on Dutton, as the sheet pulls down, partially uncovering

Blood dripping from crude letters carved in his bald pate--the word "

Out of here
Now
but through a digital miracle the "Daisy" frame has been grabbed, and appears as a still now behind Gonzalez
-   struck dumb by this
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 34
Shocking even for these mean streets, the word "Daisy" apparently cut into his head by the perpetrator, still at large name
Perhaps a message
Gonzalez   as Erin backs away from the
What
What is it
Lauren called me that when we were little
Daisy
No one knew but us
Honey
It's doesn't mean anything
It's not a message
That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren
It still doesn't mean
He said he'd prove it
Off Randall, as he sits on the bed, thoughtful

Continuing upward,
The Crow, perched high on a building
It takes flight
-  - The Crow soaring through this lousy part of town
-   - The Crow swoops in, lands on the roof of a low end brick building, peers down over the edge
Camera   the side of he building finding a light, someone burning the midnight oil
a   mid-game near the open window as
'  - Erlich's  knocks a pile of papers to the floor off a desk piled high with briefs
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 35
don't know about any knife
'm trying to forget that case
Well someone isn't
They killed Dutton
It wasn't me
No shit
You couldn't get close to him
But 'm betting you know who did
Who's into Corvis
Huh
Erlich flips through a Rolodex, knocks it to the floor, then picks up a   off the desk
(') Not a lot of calls
Business slow
He tosses the phone log out the window
-   - Watching the phone log fluttering down
, sitting where the Crow was perched, wearing Dutton's badge on his evolving costume
Alex winces at the voices faint but audible from below
' You're the only one gave a flying fuck about him when he was alive
' Lauren Randall did
' Hey
Bitches are crazy
Richer they are, crazier they get
" " The name "Erlich, Vincent" crossed off now by Alex
'  - Erlich limps through frame toward Walsh, grabs him roughly by the collar
Maybe if you hadn't fried an innocent kid
Who is it
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 36
How about the real killer
You think of that
Erlich violently tosses Walsh crashing back toward the window, falling by the chess board
If you're covering for someone, that's jail time
got my eye on you
Erlich exits, slamming the door behind him
Walsh starts to get up, stops
Looking at his own eye level
'   set up identically to the game in Alex's cell, a piece of   protruding from under the board
Walsh pulls it out
It says "-->B5"  makes the move, Queen to Bishop Five

Looks at

arms around each other in the woods, smiling
sensing something, a presence

Walsh moves cautiously to the curtains, draws them back
Nothing
He leans out the window

handful of gravelly  lands on the windshield, starts to get smeared around
pounding the window from inside
(') No
Shit
The bum is giving the driver side window the same treatment
Hard to see anything now
Erlich throws up his hands in disgust, reaches for the door handle just as
The driver side window  as something enters at high speed  Erlich across the car
Erlich's head bounces off the passenger window, leaving a Alex in the driver seat now
The Germans really know how to make a car, don't they

It looks huge in the cramped sports car
(re: Lauren knife) heard you were looking for this
You're the guy killed Dutton
want you to think of me as the guy who killed you
Erlich pulls a
380 - stashed between the two seats
Points it at Alex
Stop the car
Alex  it and
Erlich blows a hole through Alex's  , a yawning aperture through which Erlich watches the passing scenery a few improbably seconds
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 38
Ow
The  closes
Knife still in Alex's hand
Fuck
Me
What happened to your leg there Officer
Hunting accident
In one swift move Alex impales the knife ' , into his thigh
Erlich , tries to remove the knife, but Alex keeps a firm grip on the handle
(') Lauren Randall shot you trying to get free
The fifty three stab wounds she died of came from you
Am  right

Erlich tries to stay steely, yells louder as
#2 - The Corvette bumps over a sidewalk, runs a red light
going the other way pulls a stunt , flips on its lights
In hot pursuit
-  - Bumpier now as Alex's driving gets more and more erratic
In Saudi Arabia they cut off the hands of petty thieves
What price for a life
Two lives
Alex yanks the Knife out and , slices through the left arm of Erlich's jacket, sawing into the
Erlich's arm bleeding
Not my arm
What you fucking want
want Lauren
want my life back
want
to know why
Why
Why's anything happen
It's all money, man
Money
The girl just got in the way
Alex grimaces, then , he yanks the sleeves off Erlich's arm
Erlich looks down, surprised to see his arm intact
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 39
The scar
Which of you has it
Nobody
Alex poises the knife for another descent
(') swear
It's a bullshit fucking story the loser boyfriend made up
This gives Alex pause
He shakes his head, clearing the reality glitch, looks up
Cop cars, lights flashing
#4 - The Corvette slides around a corner, screams into a final straightaway that dead ends into the sloping concrete side of an overpass
The cops not far behind
The Porsche bottoming out on a bump now ant
-  - Alex's sun visor falls partway down from the jolt
He reaches to push it back into position and notices
The

Alex suddenly calm

The volume on the Elvis song pumped up
relaxes back in his seat as they scream toward the abutment
Are you out of your fucking mind
We're going to die
How can you die if you're already dead
You're him
Corvis
was talking about you
Alex smiles as the   pops out
He grabs it and the  vanishes as he closes his fist around it
Erlich turns front in horror
The microsecond of terror realized as Elvis climaxes, the retaining wall zoomes in
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 40
My dream
comes true
right now
/  - The Corvette hits at a million mph
Crumpling, disintegrating, and hurling two bodies bouncing off the abutment
-    Too late
half dozen cars bearing down all lights and sirens
Screeching to a halt by what used to be a silver Porsche
The ruptured gas tank spurting
screeches to a halt
Both doors fly open
Toomey and Larkin step out
Toomey on his radio as Larkin looks up the embankment, catches a glimpse of
battered but alive, jerkily unclenches his fist, still holding the Lighter, glow fading
He tosses
arcs down onto the ex-Corvette
- Cops shield themselves as the Crash scene explodes in a huge  that engulfs a cruiser stopped too close by
-   the  rams the car into Tires squeal as the fireball hits and
-  Engine compartment ignites, a second fireball racing backward into another Cruiser
Total chaos now
focussed on Alex, seen vaguely through the flames
Moving toward him
as he arrives at the top of the enbankment, draws his weapon
Hyperalert
Alex is gone, but he finds
'  two hundred broken boned bagged by bruises
Larkin pulls something out of Erlich's shattered fist
It's

Erin turns, sees the Crow perched on the window ledge
As she moves to the open window, the Crow flies off

looks, wondering, then spots something closer to hom
She moves off,  through frame
Alex
He looks down now, at the front door where
-   - Erin exits the front door and we see her framed against the huge house, a rich-man's castle built in the twenties of quarried stone, quarter sawn oak and leaded glass
Erin, like her sister, a child of privilege
She approaches Alex
Daisy
How did you know
told you,  knew your sister
You killed that cop Dutton
And another one
There
Erlich
Took a wrong turn
Alex points at the distant crash site, the vague flashing lights
know who you are
(no response) That's why you paint your face
To hide
'm not hiding
'm right here
You killed Lauren
You killed her
Erin shakes her head, trying to absorb what's going on, then  , screaming, beating on him, fists of fury
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 42
Not me
Dirty cops killed her
Dutton, Erlich
Alex tries to handle her flailing arms but she's too manic
He's getting hit in the face, the chest, and it's hurting
He grabs her roughly, gets her to stop
(') 've been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt
But what you're doing now, does
don't know why
My dad was right
He said you'd ruin her life
No
Listen to me
Lauren found out something they didn't want her to know
(then) This
He holds up a Card, the Registration from the Corvette
(') From the bonfire over there
Look at it
No
Why are you haunting me
Because you need to understand
And you need
to be careful
He tries to give it to her one more time, then flips the card through the air
She turns, watching its flight all the way to the landing by the front door
(') 'm sorry
Your father wasn't right
She turns back and
He's gone
Erin walks to the door
Despite herself reaches for the Card on the landing
It's
which we see clearly for the first time
Owned by a company called
The address is 4201 Forestview Drive
spins around horrified, holds up the Registration

- 4201  matches the numbers two feet away from her--the address plaque on her own house

Not yours
You didn't testify
You're not on the list

Madden shakes his head like this is bad news, rises and leaves

She's got a heavy mascara trailer park vibe, looks up from her eyelash curler at the sound of approaching
-     Madden approaches
Stops
smiles, hits a  under the counter
The door to the Captain's office swings open
Glad 'm not you
Right back at ya
She checks out Madden as he moves past her, then puts the eyelash curler away in a  containing a couple of razor sharp

Madden produces "The List," flips it over to show the Crow doodle in blood
No shit he leaves a sign
He's a goddamn Picasso
The Captain slaps down a crime scene photo--the Crow emblazoned huge on the top of Dutton's cruiser

Do you know this
The Captain  a file down in front of Madden, who lets things cool out a moment before looking at it

The eyewitness in the Corvis case
Some hooker phoned it in
There was a riot at his apartment yesterday
Guy dressed for Halloween
Good for you
You do know something
They look up as the Secretary enters, holding the door open, like it's time to leave
Madden starts to speak and
(') Don't say
Just do
Before it all comes tumbling down
The Secretary gives Madden a look as he exits, then joins the captain who's standing

holding glass bowls and trophies presented to the Captain over the years for Civic Service
The Secretary wraps her arms around him from behind as he looks at his loot
(') Idiots
Sssshhhh
You're the only one who makes it go away
As he turns toward her embrace,   to point up something we may have noticed
-   , on one of the glass shelves
: - toward the large stone house
light comes on at one end of the lower floor, shining through the window
- '  - Erin works at her father's desk under the light of an antique floor lamp
Using a   to  open

Takes it out
lays the file open on the desktop

Judging from the paper spaghetti in the basket underneath, recently used
scoops up the shreds of paper
No way to reassemble this
(trying to be casual) What are you doing there
Erin's a terrible liar, spooked as he approaches

Looks like you have them both on

Cops did
Didn't they

Never

don't believe you

Get away
He edges away from the car, reluctantly
She starts to get in, anger giving way to extreme sadness
(') (crying now) They killed Alex for something you did, daddy
You killed both of them
She gets in the car
Starts it
She peels out backward down the driveway

The Neighbor shakes her head at Nathan, goes back inside

With a pet bird
Tommy nods
(') Turn down that fucking baby
The baby's gets quieter as the mom rocks it

Larkin helps Tommy to his feet
Places "The List" on the table
Then  Tommy's face down on top of it

It's fucking next
Larkin hauls Tommy back upright
Dazed

Think before you speak
Cause at this point  got to hear something besides the crap you're been spewing

Toomey cycles his 9mm
Everything dead silent
He said the whole trial was a setup
That  caused an innocent kid to die
Is that true
Larkin grimaces
The only question is how to end this

The two guys look at each other a long moment, cross the few steps to hug
Walsh blown away
(') 'd like to say you're looking good, but
Walsh leans in, examines Dutton's  on Alex's costume
Two down
Two to go
"Down
" Wait, don't tell me
The cops from my trial
They killed Lauren
The whole thing was fixed
() ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 51
(') (off Walsh) You think 'm crazy
'm thinking
that explains a lot
Walsh sits down
Disturbed
Lauren's father's involved
He bought the cops fancy cars,  don't know what else
It's a company called ---
think Lauren found out
What do they do that they had to kill her
was hoping you'd find out
Yeah
sure will
They both turn as the Crow lands in the window,
(') (at the bird) Boo
The Crow flies off
Walsh goes to the window and looks out
(') What's the deal with this bird
It's been hanging around
Alex
He turns toward Alex, who's gone
double take as Walsh gets it, whips around, looks out the window again
: -  - Far above a solitary car winding through an old-growth forest, its headlights stabbing the darkness
The Crow soars into frame, watching
: - simple   illuminated by the headlights of the Big Benz as it pulls off the road into the grove of huge trees dripping with moss
Erin blank as she turns off the car, leaving the headlights on
Silence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 52
as she steps from the car, walks toward the cross
Partway there
Erin looks up, finds the Crow fluttering in to perch high overhead
Alex emerges from behind a tree, near the cross
This is where it happened
Right over here
Yeah,  know
She stays where she is
Alex quiet, affected by the place
Erin's about to lose it
Are you ok
When Lauren was missing the police came to our house
They said they were looking for her, right
(breaking down) But  know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you
No
is that  sent them here told them she came here sometimes
With her dirtball boyfriend
That's exactly what  said
She's crying softly
He draws nearer
Erin
It's not your fault
(losing it now) It's all my fault
Oh God
wish were dead
No
You don't
Yes  do,  really do
Seeming to lose patience, Alex lunges at her, like an attack
There were four of them
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 53
No
He's holding his hands over her eyes, transferring that shake them both
/'   Jolting
Plainwrap stops where the Mercedes is now
hand slams the car into Park
Doors open
Four men get out, seen dimly, but they're Dutton, Erlich, Larkin, Toomey
Erlich reaches back in to drag Lauren out of the back seat, her hands cuffed in front of her
Dutton flips up her skirt with his nightstick
' Four large men
And still
Lauren stumbles into Erlich, grabs and
He takes a shot in the leg from his own, still holstered weapon
'  (') She grabbed one of their guns
Got off a shot, then ran, ran for her life
-  Erin's covering her face, like trying to avoid seeing some horrible thing
don't want to know
Alex grabs Erin, forces her to run with him, awkwardly, like a three legged race
Tracing the path Lauren covered
She ran
Them breathing down her neck
Erin stumbling as Alex pushes, cajoles her, the two of them running toward a large tree,  to
/'   Lauren stumbling, her cuffed hands hindering, tree limbs hitting her face
Her own panting subsumed in the panting of the cops on her heels
' all the way from the road to this tree
-  Erin still trying not to see
Alex forcing her
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 54
This tree
Here's where it happened
don't want to see
Alex spins her up against the tree and we  to
/'   Lauren an adrenaline crazed fighter destined to lose
Her movements , strobed
Discontinuous and jarring
' She turned and faced them and went down kicking and punching and fighting them, fighting death as they stabbed her and stabbed her
Fifty three times
The brutal cops overwhelm Lauren
She drops to the ground as
Erin drops to the forest floor, convulsed in sobs
She fought for her life because life is worth living
Alex panting
Fierce
(') Think about that
And then tell me how much you wish you were dead
Off Erin, sobbing, heartbroken
Alex's fury waning as he looks at her, wonders if he did the right thing
: -  - Armed men and barbed wire
The Spotlight  and we're
-   - An odd foursome approaches from the far end of the hall
Mercer escorts Madden, the Captain, and the Secretary who hangs on her bosses arm, gawking like a tourist
Why wasn't the incident reported
Nothing to report
All inmates were present and accounted for
So you pretended nothing happened
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 55
Hey, Corvis fried
don't really see how it could be him
No
wouldn't expect you to
They all enter
-  - Mercer goes to the locker where he left Alex
Be forewarned
Nature takes its toll
(opens locker) Bon appetit
The all look inside
The locker is empty
Mercer's the only one shocked
He noisily opens and shuts the other lockers looking for Alex
You lost him
Now lay off the fucking doors
Mercer stops, backs off, gives the power trio some space
They botched the execution
Could say that
Christ
It was Corvis
Tommy Leonard was right
Maybe you were a little harsh on him
They watch now as the Secretary moves, drawn to the mirror
(') Babe
She's looking at Shards of glass selectively removed forming, we see now, a
Fucking crow
Sign of the dead come back to life
Madden turns, not comfortable with the concept
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 56
How about sign of a big black bird
The dead can return, given sufficient motivation
And Corvis has that
This guy David Jenkins came back as a ghost because my uncle owed him four dollars
Followed him everywhere
Ruined his life
Time out
You really saying he's back from beyond
The Secretary nestles into the Captain, who whispers in her ear
He nods
(') Cause if you're losing your mind, got a right to know
He's looking for something
Won't stop until he finds it
(then) Sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want
The man
with the scar
: - Erin sits cross-legged in the  of the Benz
Alex perches Crow-like on the hood
took everything  ever cared about
Left me with nothing
So you're going to kill him
Have to find him first
He closes his eyes
Pained at a memory
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 57
(') You know what Lauren and  were fighting about that night
She had a secret, wouldn't tell me
My father
All  knew, she was pulling away
It made me crazy
used to be so proud of him
My big deal daddy
And now, he's just a crook
Worse even
And the weird thing is
She fights back tears
Gains strength
(') wish  could hate him but  can't
He said he'd never hurt either of us, and  know it's true and
'm going back
It's what Lauren would do
Erin nods, takes the Locket off her neck
want to forget
Forget what know
Forget myself
Forget everything
She winds up to toss the Locket away and Alex hops down off the hood
Stops her
Takes the Locket (') (re: Locket) Keep it
Because it connects you to Lauren
And it connects you to me
He fastens the Locket back around her neck
covenant
(') No matter what happens 'll make sure everyone knows
That you're innocent
That you loved her promise
Erin pulls some makeup out of her jacket pocket
Dumps it on the ground
Finds a pot of dark eyeshadow among the containers

Make me like you

Erin's face blasted  by
She closes her eyes as Alex begins the first bold lines around her eyes and for a moment in the gauzy white light, she could be
opens her eyes a second, smiles, shuts them again
Alex paints Erin's face in the Benz headlights, the two of them kneeling in the forest-cathedral
Camera creeps , leaving the two of them connected by ritual
And touch
And a promise to each other
: '  - '  - mess of documents
Nathan nervously writing, assembling a tell-all at his desk
You know it doesn't work this way
Nathan gets up
Tries to subtly herd the Captain off
'm out of this
Partnerships don't end like that
Friendships don't
Our friendship ended when Lauren died
The Captain circles to the desk now, past Nathan
Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan
Because there's a ghost threatening us
You mean Alex
mean Lauren
The Captain flips through some of the papers on the desk
Frowns
He closes a file folder
(') Because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident
You killed my daughter
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 59
An accident, Nathan
(exploding now) She was eighteen years old
There were four of them
They stabbed her fifty three times
Where's the fucking accident
Huh
Where is it
Nathan furious
The Captain keeps a preternatural calm
watched her grow up
Just like you
know how her mind worked
She kept snooping around because she was worried about you
What you'd gotten yourself into
So stop blaming me
And blame yourself
(beat, quietly) do
Every day
Erin knows, doesn't she
This catches Nathan off guard
He starts to say something
(') Don't even bother
You never were a good liar
The Captain flips through the papers on the desk again
(') Look at this
Everything we worked for
You tell me
what are we going to do
: -   - approach from down the street
The Big Benz pulls into the empty driveway
Erin alone in the car, her mood tough to judge in the Crow mask

Then she calls out
Dad
You home

She listens up
Grabs a Towel to blot the water on her face
We begin to hear with her
She tightens the sink faucets
The sound continues as she moves to
Faucet not dripping, but the sound is louder
Erin grabs the shower curtain, whips it back
behind the tub, face a mask of gore, blown off point blank by the   on the tile next to him

'  - The Chess set
few pieces moved off the board now
Alex not looking at it
He's looking at the picture of himself and Lauren taped in the lid of the Chess box
It's like a bowl of spaghetti

But in turn owns a dozen other corporations
big mess to wade through, so  checked out Tommy Leonard
Alex picks up the
Leonard, Dutton, Erlich

We're getting there
Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "The Hole

Owned by

Alex places the picture of himself with Lauren back in the box of chess pieces, against the open lid
(') Places like that, they're about unreported cash, processing money from drugs, prostitution
(then) took a chance, called asking for Larkin and Toomey, the two other cops
Whoever answered said "they're not here
(meaningfully) this is the front office
" They look up
shadow banging on the door
Leaving on the outside of the frosted glass
Alex
Walsh opens the door and Erin enters, wild and blood smeared, remnants of the Crow mask around her eyes
(') They killed my dad
It all catches up with her now, the flight, the exhaustion
She throws herself into his arms
It's ok, it's ok
It's not
can't take it
Erin
Who
don't know
found him lying there
Alex immobilized by this
He turns to Walsh
Where is it
This place

What
Call the police
What is this
Where are you going
Alex waiting for an address
Finally

1315 Berkeley Street
Don't leave me
Please
Alex turns to her, comforting
Holds her face in his hands
It will be over soon
(then) Watch out for each other
He heads off and we - sexbomb death metal
: " " - More debauched than our previous visit
Darker, more crowded
Patrons propositioned in front of our eyes by girls barely eighteen
The room writhing
the "Cop" strippers we saw before, but dangerous seeming, as they pantomime an interrogation, a handcuffed "perp" manhandled between them
Alex blows past people waiting to get in, creating enough disturbance that   greet him
Toomey and Larkin
They're expecting me
The Two Bouncers give each other a look
One points to a on the wall: "You must be 21

The audience turns as

The First Bouncer goes flying above the heads of the crowd, getting off a dramatic  while airborne, inducing
Patrons stampeding as
Alex taking bullets, the miracle lost in the chaotic exit
The Bouncers out of sight underfoot

Buffeted, stationary as everyone flees
With the exodus still at flood stage

He's nervous, ill-suited for this cloak and dagger stuff, chattering
We'll be safe in my car
Nobody will recognize it
Let's move yours in back, no, down the block
Hope it's nothing fancy
There's a chop shop around the corner
She's looking elsewhere, at the door that has quietly opened
The Captain stands there
Somber reptile
Holding a sheaf of papers in one hand
You followed me here
No
Erin,  put out a bulletin on your car because
there's bad news
And  thought you should hear it from me
She stares at him expressionless
(') Your father got involved with some bad cops
On my force, so  take responsibility
(beat, then) He killed himself
She talks with great difficulty
How
How did he kill himself
She nods
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 64
(') With a gun
Is that what you mean
No
mean
how did he kill himself How do you figure he killed himself--with a gun, right--when it wasn't anywhere near where you found him
He takes a step toward her
She pulls out the Blood Pistol
Seems crazy enough to use it
(') You killed him
Erin
Don't
Back the fuck off
Now
The Captain stops, gently tosses the sheaf of papers toward her, onto Walsh's desk
The papers Nathan was preparing
Walsh looks at them while
He left this
Names, addresses, a note to you
These people he was involved with killed Lauren
He couldn't bear it anymore
My God
He's right, it's all here
The note
Show it to me
Erin has one eye on the papers now, recognizes her dad's hand
The Captain inches forward
(') (to Captain) Not you
(to Walsh) Show it to me
The Captain steps forward, right to the desk
Erin backed into a corner now
It's right there, under that paper

Look
She holds a hand out for the note, taking her eye off the situation for one second as she reads

Not a suicide note

chunk of the ceiling falls as the weapon discharges
The Captain throws her in a chokehold, her finger still on the trigger

She fights as the Captain wraps his own hand over hers, wrestles her arm toward Walsh, in the sights now
blown backward, collapsing by the Chess Board
Trying to pull himself up
Erin struggling
As
enters from the hall, in a hurry, gun drawn
You need help
He nods toward Walsh, who is moving, barely
Hurry
We don't have much time

The girl cuffed onstage
Alex goes up to the terrified girl
Close up, she looks way underage
He gathers her clothes, spots a key on the floor
How old are you
She listens as he unlocks the cuffs

Take it

He watches as she hightails it out the front door, still half naked
As she leaves

Alex takes a deep breath, as if it hurts
The casualties

As Alex gropes for a lightswitch, a Toomey and Larkin lean in, light up in synch
Alex takes in the dark fringes, dim reflections off lots of eyes
Not taxidermy specimens
dozen police officers lining the walls empty cartridges into Alex in an angry,  fusillade
In the silence that follows
(after the fact) Don't move

Larkin makes his way to a light switch by the door

Larkin flips on the low-watt   hanging down past industrial pipes and conduit, casting a dim light on the cinderblock space

He   as bullets from below  all around him
Alex scampers across framing as
The   burst, all but one, plunging us back in to near darkness as Alex drops to the ground near Larkin's fallen body

tears the "No Admittance" curtain completely off its rod, arriving at the fantasy sets just in time to see
Toomey (frozen) scurrying through
Gone now as the monitor updates
Then Alex appears, following him through the set
moving to the rear of the "dungeon," on Toomey's heels
Toomey hits him full force with  , sending Alex sprawling backward,  the flimsy Shower set
Toomey swings again, misses Alex, but connects with
to the water heater ripped out by the blow
The sound of gas, loud, as the line breaks
Alex straddles Toomey, just as Toomey manages to get his gun pointed in Alex's face
Hissing gas nearby
Toomey cocks the gun
(') Spark, gas
bad combination
And it's not this leak here, that's the least of your worries
Alex swings Toomey's pipe  at a much bigger right behind the gas heater, leaving it badly cracked
The hiss magnified 100% nos

What fucking scar

Forced back by too- intense flame as another beam falls, the rubble shifts and
skeletal now, baked down to bones

He yanks a large piece of glass from his flesh
Painful
Alex registers that the rules have changed
He finds a necktie of Walsh's, uses it to bind the wound, staunch the flow
He scans the room again looking for
Something

(') But the face, well, makeup can work for you or against you
Right
The Secretary applies a last flourish of polish, then stands, kisses Erin gently
(') All done
Very nice
(then) You're a good listener
The Secretary moves off
'    shut in a rough zigzag stitch, like the scar
Her eyes dart as
opens
The Captain and Madden carry Alex in
Madden sweeps the   back with his hand, clearing a space for Alex on the table
Among them

on its Corvus Brachyrhynchos stand takes a small hop backward, this sign of life unnoticed as
Alex heaved onto the table
So was he dead
Or alive
The Secretary puts her ear to Alex's lifeless lips
've seen birds stuffed and mounted so lifelike you'd swear you saw them breathing
This reminds him
he looks at the Crow on the stand
Lifeless, stuffed
As it should be
(') Maybe we had a case of that here
(to Secretary) Get me my kit
You two are majorly demented
Anyone ever tell you that
The Secretary steps off to grab thekit, leaving Alex's lifeless open eyes pointing toward Erin, reflected in his eyeballs first before
-  looking up at her own hands, bound above her as she eases them apart and
The    slips from between her palms and she closes them again in time to catch the chain, the locket swinging
-
The locket reflected in Alex's lifeless open eyes a second before
The Secretary returns, blocking the sightline
Lays out the Kit, nasty looking tools left over from the Inquisition
Then unbuttons Alex's tattered shirt, undressing him for the procedure
Stab wounds everywhere
Fifty three
In all the excitement  kind of lost count
(then) think 'll mount him with his head up his ass
large , the Lauren murder weapon, angles in at the base of Alex'sneck where the Secretary's head was
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 78
-  moves on the table
Takes flight
turn toward the commotion
(') Grab it
-  Snatched in midair by the Crow from Erin's praying hands
/'
Dim memories from the woods
Anamorphic and dark
Two figures--Alex and Erin--kneeling
- released from the Crow's beak, passing through the ' uncaught, bouncing off Alex onto the table, in front of his open eyes
/'
Alex fastens the  around her neck
The distortion lessening, becoming Alex's
it connects you to me
No matter what happens
you're innocent
promise
Alex painting her face
Alex
The Captain reacts--oh shit--starts to bring the knife down, a hurried strike at Alex's chest
Alex grabs the Captain's arm in his hand, stopping the movement on a dime
All lies
Everything you ever showed me
pulls a gun, points it at Erin
jumps up, flying the gun as it goes off
They tumble    into the Captain's office while
cuts down the rope holding Erin
She collapses
strewn with blades, secreting one between her hands, in the second before
drags Erin off
The Secretary flails at the Crow with a metal , while
'  Madden has the gun on Alex now
No effect
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 79
Madden sweating it now, continuing to shoot with no effect as
The Secretary finally connects with the Crow, batting it against the wall, noticing this coincides with
Alex goes flying against the desk, winged himself
Madden c Onfused, not understanding
(
) It's the bird
Kill it
Madden wheels, points the gun through the busted-out picture window into
The  dives for cover as bullets explode around her
The Crow dancing, sprayed with debris
: -  - Floor lights sequence above the door, heading for underground parking
"5 - 4 - 3
" The Captain watches the lights
Erin is slumped face first against the side of the elevator opposite him
You brought him back
Good
He owes you
We'll stick together, you and
face pressed against the elevator wall, intent
(') Seen but not heard
They ought to make it a law
Erin winces, looks down
emerging from her sleeve as she tries to hold it with her two bound hands
The elevator jerks to a stop
grabs her off the floor and she  the blade into his abdomen with the force of the entire body
Twists it
The elevator doors open
pulls out the blade, claws her way out the door, the Captain hanging on to her, finally getting free as she swipes at him again, drawing fresh blood
Running now, into
-   - Erin stumbles between cars in the dark underground garage, cutting the cord off her hands, leaving it behind as
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 80
Behind her, the Captain unsteady on his feet, a wounded animal
He pulls out a  9MM and -
Cycles it
Erin dives between cars, scrambling on hands and knees
Looks around
-  a small garage with a few police cruisers by a   and no people
barred  over the exit
No way out
winces
Then stifles a cry as she cuts the stitches off her mouth with the knife
Drops the threads on the floor and moves off
: - '  - Alex runs past the glass  , takes a flying leap behind the desk, seeking cover as Madden empties a clip at him
The slide ratchets back
Madden  another clip in, advances on Alex, hidden behind the shredded desk as
clears stuffed birds off the table trying to expose the wounded crow cowering back against the wall
Here pretty bird
Here birdy
She grabs it, the Crow flapping desperately as
'  Madden creeps up on the desk, peers over it
Nothing
Out of nowhere
Alex rushes Madden, bulldozing him across the room with a pained cry of brute force toward
Glass shatters as Alex hurls Madden, who swivels around in time to get off a last shot
That collapses Alex to the floor
The Crow squeezes out of the Secretary's grasp, leaving her holding a couple feathers
'  Alex hauls himself off the floor as the Crow joins him
Seeing
'  has taken its place among glass bowls and trophies, half decapitated by the glass shelf it now rests on
Down the shelf from the stuffed bird
rushes through the blown out window into
Seeing for the first time that Erin is gone, the rope hanging from the ceiling, finding

(') sitting on the floor, painting her own toenails , leaning up against the wall
Where'd they go
Alex eases the Secretary to her feet with a hand around her neck, her back to the wall
She looks , smiling at
-    hangs high overhead from some kind of hook
His arm has been crudely removed
Underneath him, on the table, a  of 2" surgical stainless steel rods sits by a pool of blood
yells, reeling, as
The door flies open
half dozen cops in, all targeting Alex as
plunges the Lauren  in Alex's back
He spins violently  her  against the wall
Surprise
-she sticks
, she's impaled on , hanging off the wall
Her head drops, looking down as a stream of blood flows down her legs, drips off her toes
(dying words) My nails
The new arrivals open fire
Alex reaches over his shoulder, yanks out the knife with an odd slurping sound as
: - The sound of  filters down from above as the Captain hunts his hidden prey
He stops, studies
'  -       The Captain's feet, joined by his hand as he picks up the thread she left on the ground
reproving herself as she turns toward camera
She looks back under the car, but
The Captain's feet have moved off
Where
She listens, hears nothing
Slips off
-  takes refuge in the service area, crouching behind stacks of
Knife at the ready
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 82
The Captain's  audible
between stacks of tires, the Captain, Glock at ready,  , moving out of sight
Footsteps Then silent
Listening, neurons firing
Cranes her neck to see
Nothing
the Captain appears  , over the stacks of tires
She's oblivious, then
Erin wheels, slashes across his wrist
The Glock falls, Erin grabs it, levels it at the Captain
Her finger tense on the trigger
(re: gun) know you too well
You won't do it
You don't know me at all
She pulls the trigger, simultaneously wrenching the gun, aiming just enough off that
yells in pain, rushes his hand to his ear, a bloody mess
He starts advancing again toward her and Erin pulls
again, again, again
No click, no blast
the Captain takes the gun from her
Shows her the he's carrying in his hand
Slams it into the gun
One in the chamber
That's all you get
Erin  as he drags her off now and
: - flies  toward the small entry window
Alex follows, bullets exploding around him as he hauls himself up toward the windowledge
- The  of a car in a hurry audible as Alex hauls himself out the small window
Runs to the edge, spotting
a dark sedan leaving in a rush, wrapping around the corner of the police station now
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 83
-   - The Captain nervous at the wheel
He looks over his shoulder
Erin's in the back seat, cuffed to the door handle
- The Sergeant and crew utterly speechless taking in the carnage
(crossing himself) Holy mother of God
The devil himself
He looks up, where Alex vanished
Starts to climb
-  - Alex dashes over the articulated roof, trying to keep in sight
partially obstructed, of the sedan below
Speeding around another corner now
alters course to cut the sedan off, jumping up onto a where he totters over the vertical face as the sedan turning onto the street below
emerge on the roof
Acquire target Alex Corvis
Stop or
Don't jump
as he takes a flying dive off the building, intercepting
-  # The Dark Sedan careening up the street leaving the city
-  - The Captain nearly jumps out of his skin, barely keeping control
What the fuck
Erin perks up in the back seat
Battered
Ever hopeful
#6 - As the speeding car passes under a streetlight, we see a   standing on top of it, legs spread, arms upstretched
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 84
The Figure, Alex, strikes downward, right  the glass moonroof
the Captain horrified as Alex's hand yanks his own right off the wheel and up, through the moonroof
Alex kneels now, holding the Captain's arm up as he jacks the sleeve down exposing
,    held in Alex's hand like the trophy it is
'  -   - Alex's voice appears
Calm
Unhurried
' The Jolt, eight amps at two to three thousand volts
It lasts a few seconds
The current surges and is turned off
'  in the darkness
Moving as he performs some unseen task
Intent, focussed
'  (') They wait for the body to cool, then check to see if the heart is still beating
, in the darkness, listening to Alex's voice
She touches her mouth, little drops of dried blood where the wounds are already healing
'  (') If it is
ba-boom, ba-boom
another jolt is applied
as our eyes adjust to the dim light
'  (') Experts say unconsciousness occcurs before pain has time to register
They agree electrocution does not "hurt," could not hurt
But it does
Unimaginably
Believe me
We're in the death chamber
Dark
Claustrophobic
The only light a few panel indicators and spill from the door open from the adjacent observation room to the outside
Alex looks at the phone on the wall
Silent
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 85
don't expect a call from the Governor
Any last words
Captain, my Captain
the Captain in the chair
private execution
Erin slumped along a side wall
Totally inscrutable
Intense
Yeah
Fuck you
long beat of silence
Was that it
Well, ok
'm not dying for your goddamn illusions
You got that
You think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you
Bullshit
She was already bored, why do you think she was looking around
You're nothing, Corvis
Less than nothing
Figure wipes through frame moving toward the switch
The Captain's voice rising as he senses time running out
(') You can't do this to me you little fucks
'll come back, just like you, a big fucking shit spewing bird and three guesses what little bitch 'm taking out first
The switch thrown
off the switch to
You are so dead
She glances at the Captain, fibrillating in the chair, starts to move off
Then stops, near Alex, looking with him at
-    fibrillating, as we  into seething detail
Writhing bodies, human suffering, a hellish miasma that draws us in until we turn our heads away, released
: -   - Alex and Erin exit the visitor's entrance, met by the Crow and the first rays of morning light
He puts his arm around her and she places her hand over his
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 86
You want to get some breakfast
(then) What  mean is
don't know how this works, but
He stops, face to face now
(') In the woods you said you had nothing
But you wouldn't, and wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go
Please
At least not right away
Erin
'll always be with you
For a split second, she's
Smiling
Sublime
She kisses him
As the break off, it's
She hangs on a long moment before letting go
Then she spots something
-   carried by one of the protestors
"Remember the Victim
" With a picture of Lauren
Someone has written a bold "s" after it
"Remember the Victims
" picks up the sign
Alex
Look at this
She turns to Alex
But he's gone
She tries to keep it together as
up leaving her alone outside the prison walls, with her memories, and her conscience, and her hopes, which is alot
As a  whips up in the parking lot, she drops the sign, and starts to
' In that moment when Alex went
wherever he went
when he made that choice,  knew  was making a choice too
To be alive
In the world
And it made me cry
: - Walsh, laid out on the table now, missing arm mercifully away from us
The  alights nearby, something in its beak
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 87
' Maybe the world is a bad place but the Captain gone has to be some improvement
And that hope, that tomorrow will be better, is enough to keep me going
The Crow flaps off,  the  , laid by Walsh's head
keeps ,
The Crow, on the stand marked Corvis Brachyrhynchos, stuffed and mute
Its eyes blink a last time, then are motionless
: -   ' -
not-too-loopy feminine hand, writing the words we are hearing
' When  think of Lauren fighting and dying, it tears me apart, but it also reassures me
That Lauren and Alex were meant for each other
Erin is writing the journal, but she's a radically transformed wild child
shock of vividly colored dreadlocks, some of the holes that stitched her mouth shut kept permanently open by studs
'  (') That they're together now
Fighters
United by love
And anger
That they've given also to me
She's leaning up against a new headstone
"Alex Corvis 1981-1999 Always With Us
" love Alex
As my sister always hoped  would
And  love Lauren
And  know, because of this, that love does not die
'm alive
Thinking of them
Hoping that, sometimes, they're thinking of me
Erin stops writing, closes the journal, stands
She takes the Locket off her neck, drapes it over Alex's headstone, like the one already over Lauren's
She stares at the two a moment, then puts her index finger to her lips, transfers kisses to the two stones
And leaves
