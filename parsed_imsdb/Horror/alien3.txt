Alien Screenplay by John Fasano Story by Vincent Ward & John Fasano March 29, 1990 "But how will you die when your time comes, Narcissus, since you have no mother
Without a mother, one cannot love
Without a mother, one cannot die
" - Hesse pinpoint of light appears
Red
An ember
Unseen  blow
The embers glow
Flame
The fire
Heated by the furnace to over 1,300 degrees fahrenheit
White Hot
Flickering flame casts dancing shadows on wooden walls
Coarsely grained wood
Moisture blasted out by years of intense heat
Timbers split
Patched with new wood, it too now old and dry
Billows up the walls
Hangs as an angry, black cloud amongst the rafters and beams of the vaulted ceiling
Almost obscures -- On a narrow , twenty feet about the Glassworks' floor
His clothing is Medieval
rough textured cassock
He is a
are set into the wall
He angles them open
The smoke begins to escape
The Monk turns, raises arms and  from his lofty perch -- Gently gliding down to the floor with the aid of a   -- a primitive hand-held pulley that runs down a rope
He lands next to the glass furnace, surrounded by -- By their dress
With Blowing Iron and Pontil
They blow and shape the molten glass
Crack off the finished pieces
The old way
Black skinned, early fifties
Stirs his five foot long blowing iron in the molten glass, but he is watching something else
It moves him to song
Lilting tenor lifts high into the air
This is
Well would he guess the ascending of the star, Wherein his patient's fortunes settled were
He knew the course of every malady, Were it of cold or heat or moist or dry
Brother John, would-be Doctour of Physick
We see the object of his song: Not yet forty
Strong features, but fear behind the eyes
The fear that comes from a lack of inner confidence
good face, nonetheless
He stirs a thick mixture in a mortar
Next to him another  sits holding his arm out in front of him, cassock sleeve rolled up, revealing a vicious
Tend you quickly he will, with bottles from a shelf
But heals not, so easily, The ills which plague himself
Brother John stops stirring
(to Kyle) Enough
He scoops the salve out with his fingers and applies it to the Burned Monk's arm
The Burned Monk  sharpley as the cool mixture contacts the injured area
(to the burned Monk) Relax
(to Kyle) Put those lungs of yours to better use
Yes, Doc Tor
Kyle laughs, removes the blowing iron from the molten glass -- a  of white hot glass hanging on the end
He rolls the blob on the Marver, a flat, polished piece of iron, then begins to blow a bottle shaped container
John wraps a fray-edged cloth bandage around the burn
Keep this from getting wet
Go home at late afternoon mealtime and don't come back to work today -- But John -- 'll tell the Abbot
Just rest today
You're lucky you only burned yourself on the side of the furnace
If some of that glass had gotten on your arm -- He points to the top of his forearm
-- it would've burned clean through to the other side
He mimes a drop down from the bottom of his arm
The Burned Monk shudders at the thought
toll
That's late afternoon
Now get on
Thank you, John
-- You're welcome
Go
The Burned Monk trundles off, injured arm against his chest
John gathers his mortar, pestle, and extra bandages into a burlap sack
Kyle comes over
Good work
All right, but 'm no Father Anselm
You're yourself, that's better
Kyle pushes him through the door
The Hallway is alive with cassocked monks
Their   reverberates throughout the building
The wooden floorboards creak beneath their combined weights
This is obviously a
The Abbot will be pleased
Don't
Don't what
Please don't tell him
At least until know if there's an infection
You want to be the Abbey's Physician, and you haven't learned the first rule: Don't worry about the patient
John's face drops
shouldn't have
Sorry
Look,  know how you must -- You don't, but thanks anyway
wide stairwell
constant stream of monks all moving down the stairs
Coming from floors above
Headed for lunch
Kyle starts down
John starts up -- Not coming down
have someone waiting for me
Kyle disappears into the crowd
John moves up
river of brown cassocks running downstream
John is the only one moving against the flow
He exits the stairwell -- narrow corridor lined with doorways
John moves to one in particular
He doesn't even look as he grabs the door knob
This is his room
He opens the door -- ' An old, worn out  lays in wait on an old, worn out cassock which is now serving as its bed
At the sight of John it stands
Come on, Mattias
The dog, , joins him in the hall
Monk and pet disappear up a flight of stairs
Past another dozen or so Monks who are on their way down
vast room filled with rows of wooden tables with low benches between aisle after aisle of floor-to-ceiling wooden shelves jammed to capacity with  of all shapes and sizes
Millions of books, from the looks of it
From each book hangs a long , long enough to allow the book to be carried only as far as the nearest table
- In his fifties, and the Librarian by his stern affect, his position behind a broad, but also old oak desk, and the large hanging from his belt
He watches the few stragglers return their chain bound volumes to the shelves and head for the door, then rises and joins them
John leans against the wall as Philip exits
Mattias is nowhere to be seen
Brother John
Brother Philip
Feeding the mind instead of the body again
My training has taught me to feed what's hungry
Philip pats his broad stomach and heads down the hallway
As did mine
As long as you're alone
Enjoy yourself -- and remember, no book leaves the library
How could  forget
Have a good meal
John watches the corpulent librarian head down the stairs
When he's gone from sight John lifts the bottom of his cassock to reveal Mattias
Perfect
They move into the library
The oldest books
John moves to the stacks
Mattias trots over to a particular bench and sits
This is his regular place
John stands on toe tips to retrieve an ancient Tome
He runs his fingers over the familiar leather binding
smile plays across his lips
He carries the book, places it on the edge of the table so there is slack in the chain
Sits on the bench next to the dog
Clears his throat, opens the book, begins to read
John (reading) In the year of our Lord 1348 , Brother Gerhado of the Minorite Abbey helped bury the Abbot and my sixty fellow monks -- / Sometimes,  think you'd like that
John turns to find -- Leader of the monastery
In his seventies but looks younger
His Cassock is adorned with a large, ornately carved, wooden in place of a rope belt
He crosses to the table
John closes the book and stands, head bowed in respect
John Abbot,  --  didn't think anyone would -- Mind
Just Philip, if he knew
passed him on the way up
He said you'd come in alone
knew better
He scratches the back of Mattias' neck
Hello, Mattias
How are you, boy
The dog snuffles in response
You know what Philip says about Mattias' hair and his breathing
You'll have to take him out of here
He likes when  read to him and -- can't -- John looks down sheepishly
Though nearly forty, he feels almost adolescent in the presence of the Abbot
The Abbot pulls a large key from his pocket
(smiles) Someone must have left this one unlocked
Take the book with you
He hands the key to John, who is shocked -- this is a great honor
Father,  --
Kyle tells me you did a good job at the glassworks today
'll reserve judgement until the patient lives
John crosses to the shelf and unlocks his book
He returns the key
It will get easier
Father Anselm was
an unexpected loss
You'll do fine
The Abbot walks towards the door
Just have it back before the end of lunch
Oh -- And  didn't see you in here
Thank you
(to Mattias) Let's go upstairs, boy
John takes his book -- Moves to a spiral wooden staircase
Mattias at his heels
Goes  -- The mechanics of the bell tower -- all ropes and wooden cogs cast scary shadows
doorway leads to -- Thick with sandy dust
The wood shows through thin patches
We     what we think is the roof of the Abbey is actually -- - The door has opened onto the
The curving horizon broken only by the very top of the Abbey bell tower poking through from the levels below
curls from vents set into the surface
Sunken areas of the planet's sirface are
This is
An manmade orbiter
shell of lightweight foamed steel, five miles in diameter
Constructed by The Company on Special Order with habitable level within finished in whatever material suits its end user
This orbiter, for reasons to be discovered later, has been sheathed in wood
Walks to the shore of an inland
Sits on a bare patch of wood
Looks up
His eyes grow accustomed to -- - Freckled with tiny dots of light
Stars
Spread across the inky void
Bathe Arceon's surface with their celestial glow
John smiles at Mattias, breathes deep
The atmosphere up here is thinner, but fresher
He opens the book
Reads aloud -- In the year of our Lord 1348 , Brother Gerhado of the Minorite Abbey helped bury the Abbot and my sixty fellow monks, day by day, one by one, until  am the only one left
stayed as long as  could bear it, then with my dog -- Mattias lifts his ears at this part
His favorite part
- fled
have put this to parchment lest this pestilence - this Black Death - stay my hand
(beat) This was finished by another hand
John closes the book
Something catches his eye -- Something among the myriad points of light in the sky
Millions of miles away: Brighter than the rest
Fast enough to leave a faint trail
Across the stars
And down
comet
John stands
Watches -- Growing brighter
Drawing nearer
Joined by three other
They are older than he
The Four men watch the sky
Brighter still
Closer
Two dozen
hundred
They come up through the planet's surface
Out of wooden trap doors
Join the others
Days pass
Now three hundred
Necks bowed back
Mouths agape

Burns brighter still as it hits the planetoid's atmosphere
Hundreds of Monks shield their eyes as the ship -- the star -- over their heads

The water boils
Fish bob to the surface
Bloated
Dead

Small leather and wood fishing boats tossed by the wake
His coracle is the first into the water

He cannot hear the  of warning

He tears off a piece of his cassock -- Rips it with his teeth -- Wraps the bloody hand

Sulaco escape vehicle #4 rocks on the water
White metal skin blackened by the heat
Rows right into it
His coracle pitches in the choppy surf
He scrambles onto the ship's cracked tile surface
Teeters -- balances -- moves to the unmistakeable
Looks around for a knob, a handle -- small panel door whose black and yellow stripes denote urgency
John hesitantly opens the door, revealing a shiny metal
He stares at it
a beat
Then quickly pulls it down
-
Hull door
The doorway is a black maw
John crosses himself
Begins to lower his foot into the hatch -- / Watch it
He almost falls backwards off the ship
Looks back -- Are rapidly approaching
Kyle gestulates wildly -- John
Wait --
Don't go in
John turns back to the open hatch
Machine recirculated air flows out
He feels it on the skin of his face
Cool
Cool, and artificial
It calls to him
He steps in
Swallowed by the blackness -- - -
The door closes behind him
#4 - Dark
Dim red lights
John stands still as his eyes adjust to the darkness
He sees: ' glass and metal  -- pneumatic piping twines around its base
The glass lid is
Small   pulses at the head of the tube -- a soft  and , like your seat belt warning -- is audible
(sotto) Seal broken
seal broken
John finds himself moving towards the tube
Looks through the broken lid: There is a splattered   on the sterile white interior
, turned rust-brown
Whatever happened here happened a while ago
Rust colored drips trail down to -- Drag marks
His eyes follow the stains to a pile of Bloody clothing against a control panel
jumpsuit
Torn
Child size
The head of child's , but no body to be found
Looks back towards the door
Part of him wants to get the hell out here -- but he fights back his fear
He is a doctor - or trying to be - someone in here may need his help
He presses forward -- Averts his gaze from the clothing,  to the blinking and glowing instrument panels and their myraid -- Pressure lights
Data lights
Warning lights
Thousands of lights
Like the stars in the sky
It's been decades since he's seen technology like this -- and never this close up
He steps further into the ship, his fear now replaced by fascination, follows the lights

The   of the Woman's message rekindles John's fear
He moves more hesitantly around the periphery of the ship, following the trail of blinking instruments -- Drawn to touch a button

Just an oxygen mask
John feels his rapidly  heart as he pushes aside the plastic, dangling object and continues around the shuttle
His hand brushes over a  which responds by lighting and -- -

Humming gently
Still operational
John approaches it cautiously
He can make out the occupant through the lid
The woman from the screen
This is
In hypersleep
Wearing a white cotton tank top and boxer-type shorts
Christ, she looks beautiful
John looks from Ripley to her image on the monitor, then back
Sinks to his knees, reverent
Fascination has replaced fear again
Moves his face closer to the lid
Closer to hers
spills in -- John's head  towards the source of the light -- Open
Kyle and the other monks
John - what is it
Is this a Supply ship
No
No supplies
Kyle, there's someone in here -- The Second Monk looks at Kyle
This is forbidden
John
Just get the hell out of there -- don't want to stay
have to get her out before this sinks
You come in, give me a hand -- Her
Look, this is not the supply ship, so this is technology forbidden to us
Get out of there now
John looks down at Ripely
is mounted at the head of the tube
red button:  "-" That's plain enough
All right -- He presses it
The Tube opens with a loud  of compressed air
The Monks at the door recoil at the sound
: -    - Ripley has been lowered into a large coracle
John holds her in front of him
Unconscious
Her head lolls as the boat rocks on the waves
The monks start to row back to short
(reverent) space ship
(even more reverent) woman
You shouldn't have gone in -- 'm supposed to be a doctor
He pushes Ripley's hair away from her forehead
She could've been lost
Been a long time since  saw either
It isn't sinking
Look at it
What are we supposed to do with it
What was it like in there --
Lights
So many lights -- Tow it in
Bring it in
It's evil
It's just technology
Evil technology
Look at these fish -- The Abbot will know what we should do with it -- Just lights
Machines
Buttons
Metal
See
Just look at the fish
The Abbot will know
They're boiled
These fish are boiled
Thousands of lights
Like the stars
Like Heaven on Earth
Ripley stirs in John's arms
Groans
Fights to come out of her fugue state
Looks around through half-lidded eyes -- She is surrounded by rowing, cassocked Monks
She closes her eyes
Tries to clear the imagine
Opens: They're still there
She looks down at the bloodied hands around her waist -- realizes she's sitting on someone's lap
Looks back over her shoulder -- He smiles at her
Friendly, not sexual
Shakes her head
Tries to speak -- Her lips form soundless words
She looks over her other shoulder, sees -- - Bobbing on the surface
Growing small with each stroke of the oars
Brows knit
Fights the cobwebs in her brain
Tries to focus on the ship -- Remembers
Turns to John, tries to speak -- Wait
New
She loses consciousness
- '  - Streaks of light move across the darkness
Form patterns of light and shadow against the wooden walls
There is a sublime stillness, but coming through the walls are the muted, far off  of the Abbey -- The  of wood
prayers
song
We move down off the wall to a hand-made wooden bed
Ripley in restless sleep
- The waters grown rough with the approach of night
Wind whips across white wave tops --  the dozen Monks who  their boats to Ripley's  with thick hemp ropes -- Start to tow it to shore
'  - Ripley is sleeping -- but struggling against some unseen foe -- She tries to sit up -- can't
Tries to shake off the effects of the suspended animation
looks up through half-lidded eyes: Sits next to her
Quite asleep
Hands swathed in white bandages
Book resting on his lap
She squints to make the figure standing in the shadows behind him -- it's skin picks up and reflects tiny points of flickering cangle light - seems to ripple as it moves -- Big, black shiny-smooth head moves into the taper light
It moves towards her, cable-like arms held out at its side -- moving out of sync with its feet -- Ripley tries to move - to cry out -- She can't
She can only move her eyes
She looks over at John, sleeping peacefully
He doesn't notice the Alien -- The Alien moves closer
She can feel his breath -- it evaporates the sweat  on her forehead -- a  runs through her but she still can't move -- The Alien stands alongside her bed
Extends a six-fingered hand
Gently rests it on her stomach
Cocks its head -- like it's listening to something
The implication is clear
Ripley finds her voice -- Her eyes open wide -- She sits bolt upright
hand moves to her forehead
Gently pushes her head back to the pillow
John's
You're out of it
Out of it
Ripley falls back, eyes glued to where the alien appeared
John sees her focal point, looks back over his shoulder: Nothing
Ripley's eyes roll back into her head
She tries to speak -- It was there
Her hand, at her side, tightens into a fist -- John's hand covers hers
Eases the fingers open again
She feels the coarse bandages against her palm
He starts to read quietly from Saint Augustines' Confessions
She begins to drowse again as his soft voice flows over her like waves lapping against the shore
- has kicked up
The monks wear small round goggles, have rags tied over their noses, as they work at a huge    arrangement -- Hundreds of ropes grow
Timbers
They  Ripley's  --  it over to a large portal -- '  - Ripley lays with eyes closed
Muffled  outside her door: How is the woman, John
don't think she's here yet
At the sound of John's voice the  smile plays across Ripley's sleeping lips
She is close, though
As they continue talking, Ripley wakes
Opens her eyes
Rolls over onto her side -- There is a window right next to the bed
Ripley lifts herself up on one elbow, looks out: Garden of Earthly delights
Monks laboring under a beautiful, celestial blue sky -- picking apples, fishing on the water on small inland lakes
Working with hammer and saw on small wooden cottages
Lyrical
It makes her feel good
She scans the countryside
Sheep graze around wooden ladders stretching hundreds of feet up to the -- Ripley does a take -- With crude brushes at the end of poles --  the sky blue
The Abbey, the cottages, the fields outside her window are all on one level -
The vaulted , painted to look like the sky with huge glass "windows" to allow the sunlight in, is actually the of the planetoid's outer shell
Ripley looks back at the Monks on the ground: Instead of repairing, they are taking the cabins apart, stacking the wood onto push carts -- What the hell --
-- The Sulaco Escape ship  in front of her
past her window suspended by ropes
Then disappears up, out of sight
Ripley checks her pulse
This must be a dream
bad one
She rolls back onto the bed
Stares up at the ceiling
- Monks scurry around the Ship as it is lowered into place on a flat area of the roof above the libaray
It seats with a deeply resounding
Hears the  and then another - her door
She turns to find the Abbot and John standing in the doorway
John waits in the doorway as the Abbot crosses to the chair by the bed and sits
Who are you
am the Abbot
Leader of this Colony
And you
He smiles
Open
Friendly
Ripley
How did  get here
Your vehicle crash landed
(indicates John) Brother John found you and brought you here
Where is here
This is the Minorite Abbey within the manmade orbiter Arceon
Can  use a radio to -- We have no radio here
We are a monastic order that has renounced all modern technology
We live the old way
The pure way
She shakes her head
Uh,  -  still don't feel 100%
Whoever took me out of the stasis tube must not have run the full - program
Where's Newt
The Abbot looks at her blankly
There was a little girl with me -- You were alone
No
She was with me
put her in her stasis tube -- We launched when the -- You were the only living thing found aboard that vessel
The Abbot watches Ripley as the terrible truth overcomes her -- (slowly) Oh, God
Newt
She stops -- gets that chill up her spine -- She realizes that she  have brought the Alien with her
It came with us
The Abbot leans in
What came with you
Listen -- there is a danger here
It came with me
How long have  been here
Almost two days -- (calculates) Loose for two days
This planet could be overrun within the week
Ripley grabs the Abbot by his cassock -- Look, there's a xenomorph -- (sees his confusion) An Alien creature
killer
monster
And now it's here
The Abbot looks at her the way you look at that guy on the corner of Santa Monica and 3rd who's babbling about Judgement Day
The guy with his pants down around his kness
She sees this, releases her hold on him
Calm down, Ripley
Okay,  was with a platoon of Colonial Marines on a mission to planetoid LV426
We left Earth six months ago - maybe a year -- (interrupts) Wait a moment -- The Abbot becomes aware of John's presence in the doorway
Turns over his shoulder at him
Leave us
John waits there a beat, then backs out and closes the door
Continue
We launched in the Cruiser Sulaco from Gateway sub-orbital space station -- Not possible
What do you mean
When we left Earth seventy years ago, it was on the brink of a New Dark Age
Technology was on the verge of destroying the planet's environment
computer virus was threatening to wipe away all recorded knowledge
There didn't seem to be any way it could be averted
In the almost forty years since we were towed out here in hypersleep, the news that came with occasional supply ships only got worse
Finally, the ships stopped coming
We had to resign ourselves to the fact that worst had come to pass, and the Earth no longer existed
Now she gives him that look
(slowly) Uh
All right
Forget the Earth - How many people do you have here
Let's worry about them
Warn them -- new look overtakes the Abbot's face
look of fear
Now she's getting to him - or is she
He abruptly stands
Your mind is troubled
You need to rest some more
don't need rest -  need to get to your people
You've got to get to them -- tell them about the alien -- He heads for the door -- have had enough for now
Enough
Didn't you hear what  said
It could wipe out the entire population of this planet
It may have started already - Have there been any unusual deaths since  got here
The Abbot stops in the door - No
And there won't be
The Abbot  the door behind him
'  - John stands nearby as the Abbot addresses two Bolt it
The guards move to bolt the door
What is it -- What's wrong
Your patient is in a dangerous mental state
Nobody gets in or out until say so
But
Her meals -- Nobody
Father,  don't understand -- The Abbot turns and disappears down the hall
John looks from the departing Abbot to the two Guard/Monks
- John has his head buried in his hands
His back rises and falls with the rhythmic breathing of sleep
Mattias curled up on his feet
Asleep as well
The Library door  open --
John sits bolt upright -- bursts in
Rushes to John's table
Brother John
You're here
The Abbot said you'd --  need -- you're the medic -- What
My Sandy -- she's ill -- John tries to rub the fitfull sleep out of his eyes
Huh
woman
Sandy
My ewe
John returns his head to the table
One of your sheep
Jesus Christ
Call a vet
Father Anselm was the vet
John looks under his arms at Mattias -- The dog just stares at him
You're no help
Okay, let me get my bag
All creatures great and small
'  - small structure housing a handful of sheep and a few chickens in wire cages
The wooden walss are full of gaps where boards have been ripped off
The Hysterical Monk holds a torch to illuminate the scene
One of his sheep is laying on its side
just gave her dinner and she keeled over
So would
It's freezing in here
Been using the wood from the walls for the fire in my cabin
Haven't we all
John kneels at the ewe
She's breathing heavy
Rapidly
John puts his left hand down on the hay covered floor while he checks the animal's neck pulse with his right hand
She gives a weak "Baa-ah
" May be pneumonia
Pitch some of that hay around her
Stop this damn cold breeze
The Hysterical Monk props the torch up in an empty bucket and retreives a crude iron pitchfork from the wall
Starts to pile hay around the fallen animal
First, 'll -- He sits up to reach for his back, then stops when he sees what's on his left hand -- - Wait a minute
The Hysterical Monk stops on mid-pitch
John rubs the material between his fingers
Brings it close to his nose
Sniffs
What is it
don't know
It's all over the ground
Some sort of -- -
The ewe starts to  -  -- John tries to hold it down -- The Hysterical Monk, at this juncture, goes completely apeshit
What
Jesus
Help m -- The ewe is shaking so violently that John is thrown back -- He knocks over the bucket -- the torch falls into the hay -- The light is cut off as the torch almost smothers
Then the hay starts to burn -- Weak fire light revealing: BAAaa-Aha---
---
Stomach  -- the two Monks with entrails and blood -- They start
The flickering   grows as
- out of the jerking and twitching carcass
It shows the characteristics of the animal in which it has gestated
Tiny razor sharp teeth and black, glass-like eyes peer from a enlongated head covered with downy, but gore-matted quadroped, its shrunked hind legs struggling to free itself from the cooling morass of intestines
John can only  as the most horrible nightmare he can imagine tries to slough off the animal's mortal coil
The Hysterical Monk, fear overcome with  at the loss of his beloved Sandy,  steps in front of the near catatonic Medic and instinctively  his pitchfork into the creature -- The sharp prongs  its still forming body -- The a high pitched  - half alien, half sheep as it is roughly  from it's nesting place -- The Monk lifts -- It  at the end of the fork, acid blood dripping onto the wood floor -- each drop bursting into a little pool of
The Hysterical Monk turns to the now raging hay fire -- The entire corner of the barn is ablaze -- the abomination in -- The Sheep/Alien  and  as tongues of flame leap up to lap at it's struggling body -- tiny tail whipping about -- The creature dies, its fading screams are soon the only sound heard within the barn
The Hysterical Monk holds his fork in the flame as he looks back to check on -- Face contorted, eyes glued to the burning creature
Heaving lungs push air through his diaphram, but no sound comes from his open mouth -- The Doctor in training has seen the devil
'  - Wooden walls collapse inward as the building becomes a pyre
Acrid black smoke curls up to the ceiling and spreads out across the rafters
We pull back from the sight  a window
Into '  - Ripley, watches the burning barn
Frustrated, she climbs out of the bed on unsteady legs, wearing her tank top and shorts
Pulls on a coarse wollen cassock, ties the rope belt -- Idiots
'll -- The door   -- What the -
Four   rush in and grab her
her out of bed -- - Ripley is dragged down the darkened hallway
An evil has come to Arceon
- As he continues we move down a row of stern Monk faces, ending at the Abbots
You heard Brother Graham tell of the devil inside sheep's wool -- He motions towards the Hysterical Monk, sitting in the crowd
An evil brought by this woman in her vessel of technology
large circular room with wooden walls stretching thirty feet high
Light creeps in through stained glass windows
Hundreds of monks sits in a gallery that looms over the floor of the Tribunal
On the floor: The Abbot and the five eldest Monks sit at a long table facing the witness stand
On the stand: Considers the faces that surround her
Fear
Hate
This can't be happening
You have no voice in this tribunal
You must listen to me
You're all in terrible danger
It came with me on the ship -- We know that
At first we believed its arrival was a good omen
But it has only brought pestilence
Dead sheep
Dead fish
Evil
Ripley turns to the Abbot
Yes, the ship brought it
Not evil
It brought the Alien
told you, it's here
We know the name of the evil it brought
It brought technology
Technology to destroy our planet, as surely as it destroyed the Earth
Destruction
was on the Earth less than a year ago
It's still there
People, cities, all still there
murmur through the crowd
Some are listening to her
The Abbot looks around
He must be in command
(matter of fact) All dead
(screams) It's still there
The Abbot smiles to himself for making her crack
He stands and begins to pace
You could not have been on the Earth a year ago, because there is no Earth to be on -- for at least twenty years
haven't been floating in space for twenty years
Let me get to my ship and 'll prove it
No
Who knows what new evils she'll release if allowed back into that infernal machine
No
Don't let her
This woman is a danger
She denies The New Dark Age
She denies reality
This is reality
There is a Xenomorph loose on this planetoid - a alien -- it must have stowed away on my ship -- must have killed -- (swallows hard) Newt
Killed the girl  brought with me
You can't stop it
It goes inside you like an egg - grows - (mimes) Explodes out of you - keeps growing into some sort of monster
Kills you -- Kills all of you
She looks at the Medieval people around her
They stare at her in complete confusion
To them, she does sound like a madwoman
Who are you people
Look at you -- all of you -- the way you're dressed
This isn't the Middle Ages
You're in space -- on a artifical planet
What are you doing out here
There, in the upper tier -- John
They make eye contact
She looks to him pleadingly
Isn't there anyone here who will listen
John looks from Ripley to the Abbot
The Abbot stares him down
John turns away
(defeated) guess not
can't believe this
The gavel
The Abbot sits in a moment of contemplation
Then there is no choice
The Four Monks grab Ripley roughly -- Bind her arms
(to Ripley) The evil is inside you
cast you down
To be sealed away
And God have mercy on your soul
: - Medieval elevator shaft
The "elevator" is a wooden cage lowered on thick, rough hewn ropes
Ripley, bound, is led to it
She looks back at the monks who have gathered at the door -- You won't be able to fight it
You don't know what it is --
She's put into the cage
The door is secured
Two monks begins to pull the ropes
The cage is lifted out over the abyss -- a vast cavernesque space
The other Monks move closer
Crowd around the edge -- John pushes through them - right to the edge -- Watches as the cage is slowly lowered down
Ripley looks directly at John -- You've sentenced yourselves to death
John watches as she disappears down into the darkness
Then turns and pushes his way through the crowd -- Down the hall -- Empty now except for the Abbot and the Tribunal Members
They speak in hushed tones
John appears in the doorway, but pauses - strains to hear what they are saying: they'll have started before she gets down to the Hermitage level
No trouble
Only finding the wood for the ship
But Anderson's hut was about that big, and he's dead three months now
had that wood earmaked for the Cloister next winter
Well, we might not get to the winter if we don't take care of this
By winter time we can start taking the penitent cells apart
No one in them
The wood isn't going to last forever
Neither are we -- He becomes aware of John's presence, and motions the other Tribunal members out of the room
John moves to the Abbot
The Abbot knows what's coming
Go ahead
This woman
Ripley
tended her -- Yes, and you did a good job
You shouldn't feel responsible
You couldn't have known -- Please, sir, let me finish
feel that there may be something to what she says
There isn't
The Abbot moves to his table, begins to gather up his gavel, notebook
John follows him -- don't understand what you are doing
This colony is my responsibility
am protecting the colony
From what
This woman
You never gave her a chance
How can you be so sure you're right
better question is what makes you think 'm wrong
You didn't see this thing -- this demon -- Brother Graham and  -- we both saw it
(realizes) That's right
You both did
(beat) And what was it
--  don't know what it was
But don't think Ripley was a party to it
She admits she brought it
But she tried to warn us -- You know that's how the devil works
Deception
But  believe her
don't know how to describe it --  feeling
You haven't seen a woman in thirty years
Where does this feeling originate, John
(points to his head) Here
Pause
believe you
But your feelings are fooling you
It's - It's her conviction
just think -- The Abbot snaps at him -- Don't think
John takes a step back at the Abbot's tone
tone he's never heard before
The Abbot runs a hand through his thinning hair
Forces a smile
It's been a long night
For all of us
You really don't understand what you're dealing with here
That's what she said
The Abbot chafes
These are ideas which threaten the very system we live under
The creature is dead and the woman is gone
Forget them
Both
Go read
Go fishing
Go anywhere, but leave this alone
But  -- Alone
'll get Philip to let Mattias into the Library, all right
For your own good, just stay out of this
John looks like he's going to protest
mean it
(slowly) Yes, Father
John turns and leaves the room
The Abbot stares after him
- Dark
Dank
Dreary
is hammered into a board
Then another
The board is old, twisted
The grain is pronounced, splintered
Another board is lifted into place, a nail held -- -- - in tight
Drab, torn gray clothing
Hammer the boards over the opening in the wall
Methodically covering up -- Watching them work
--
Defeated
() dozen Monks frantically hammer planks up around the Sulacco escape ship -  frame of wood -- begin to wall it in
The two   continue their carpentry
The planks cover more of the opening
--
Covers more of Ripley
--
She stares
Planks are rising around the ship
Covering it
Locking away the good omen turned evil
John and Mattias sit before an open book
He doesn't read
He can hear the  of the hammers
It seems to reverberate  the planet
Through his
He closes his eyes in pain
Only her face is visible
Another board
--
Then just her eyes
Just before the last plank is put in place -- Here you go, woman
Something from your ship
Something to keep you company -- He tosses it into the cell
Ripley catches it
Watches as the last of the light is covered over
-
She continues to stare at the once open wall as her eyes grow accustomed to the darkness
The little light creeping between the planks grows in intensity until it is soon enough to see what it is she has caught -- ' '
Ripley looks around her cell -- actually a narrow space behind other cells, one wall curved out -- like a narrow slice crossways towards the edge of the pie
Looks at the Doll's head in her hand
beat
She   --
You fucking idiots
You're dead
You're all dead
the walls
her  against the wall
Again
Her nose starts to bleed
Her hand goes to her nose
She squints in the darkenss
Sees the
Tastes the iron taste in her mouth
Death is with her again
(sotto) Dead
The "widest" part of her cell, the middle, allows her to slide down into a sitting position
She does
Christ
Jesus Christ
It's here
Here
Shit
Here
can't get rid of it
Looks at the Doll's head -- Newt
This isn't what  wanted
She throws the doll's head away -- It bounces off the wall and rolls back to an upright position so that it is staring at her
(snaps) Don't stare at me
Beat
/ Sorry
Ripley looks down at the base of the wall facing her -- Where it meets the floor, in the rotting timbers: In it: ' Bright, wrinkled eyes beneath a snowy white crew cut
He's looking back at her
- The Sulaco escape pod #4 is now a memory as the Monks have finished walling it up
Now just another part of the Abbey
As the Monks move down the thin wooden ladders we follow -- Pass them -- down to an open window and into
-    - John is here, Mattias asleep at his feet
The tables, the benches, the floor are  with hundreds of books he's pulled off the shelves, their chains all
All open to -- Different representations of Evil through the ages -- Lucifer, Shaitan, Ahriman, Asmodeus -- Satan
"The Temptation of Christ" from the Master of Schloss Lichtenstein
Satan roasting on an enormous grill from "Tres riches heures du Duc de Berry
" The devil as a serpent
As a semi-humanoid
Gruenwald's "Temptation of St
Anthony
" Pacher's "Saint Wolfgang and the Devil
" miasma of Medieval Monsters
Picks his way through the mess
Like a man possessed he fumbles through book after book
The first golden rays of daylight filter through the huge stained glass windows
John rapidly flips through the Medieval tome in front of him - past an illustration of Satan depicted as having a  on his  -- further still -- then stops
This is it
We can't see what the illustration is, but we see his : His eyes open wide as saucers
the book closed as if the image would strike blind
He turns to Mattias as if to say something -- Decides not to wake the sleeping dog
John wraps the book's chain around his hand and puts one foot up against the shelf
Pulls --
The old chain gives way
Face set, he loops the shoulder strap of his burlap medical bag over his shoulder
Clutches the book to his chest, gently pets his sleeping dog and goes
'  - John strides down the corridor purposefully but stops and flattens himself against the wall when the door to the Abbot's office opens suddenly -- , The Hysterical Monk, is forcibly led from the room by two burly Monks, taken down the corridor in the other direction
He is gagged
third Burly Monk moves out of the doorway with the Abbot
Now find John and have him brought to me immediately
Yes, Father
Start in the library
And keep it quiet
The Third Burly Monk nods and moves off
The Abbot watches him leave, then goes back into the room and closes the door
John stares at the closed door a beat and then makes up his mind
He turns and runs back down the hallway
- The first Monks straggle in for the morning shift
Kyle is among them
He lifts his blowing iron from a wall mounted rack and moves towards the glass furnace as two other Monks begin to stoke the fire
John enters
Looks around the room and for a frantic moment cannot find -- At the glass furnace
About to dip his blowing iron into the John runs over to him
Almost knocks him over -- Hey
Watch it
He sees that John is agitated -- What
What is it
The other monks begin to notice the commotion, start moving in for a look
-- Abbot
Must -- John tries to catch his breath
He gestulates wildly
Kyle puts down his blowing iron
John - relax
Take a deep breath - Christ, now  sound like you -- He sees the book clutched in John's white knuckled hands
Is that it, John
Is it the book --
(panting) Yes
Devil
Kyle moves closer to him
Cautiously
John sees the other monks gathering around -- Closing in on him - whispering -- He's got it
Like the Comet Woman
He found her
He's infected
John sees one of the Monks run out -- undoubtedly going to tell the Abbot
John looks into his friend Kyle's face -- Fear
Everything's gonna be fine
Now, let's see the -- Don't humor me -- 'm -- Sure
Everything's gonna be fine
If only he could explain - he can't
John  the book away -- spins -- Bursts through the crowd
Wait --
- The cage is still down, the ropes stretching into the abyss
John runs in
Moves to the ropes
Places the book on the floor
Tightens his scarred hands on the rope -- Mind racing: The woman will know
Know what it is
How to combat it
He  -- There's no tension against the ropes
John  back on his ass
The ropes  through the rusty pulley overhead
Pile on the floor in front of John
He lifts the end of the rope
Stares: : - John  through the building
Through the upper half of the planet
through the many levels, past dozens of Monks oblivious to the previous night's events and the danger they face: Monks working at Looms
Monks in the Tanning Room
Monks in Morning Prayer
Past them all, to -- - Mops and brooms
John enters
His hair is wild, breathing heavy
He shoves the book into his medical bag
Pushes aside a box of kindling wood to reveal a set into the timbers of the floor
He opens the door: Extending down through huge open areas beneath the upper level
Past vast underground viaducts that held up by wooden rafters
Beyond that - a great underground sea that marks the center of the planet - below that, the cells
And Ripley
Can smell the dank air from the lower tunnels
He  go down -- The hard way
He climbs into the darkness
- An enormous room, over a football field in length, consisting of at least a hundred open toilet  facing a hundred wall mounted
Their condition, though, bespeaks the awful truth - The stalls furthest away from us are
Some have had the side walls stripped for fire wood
Of the original hundred sinks, maybe twenty are still functional -  facility created for a much larger number of colonists than are left
washes his hands
Moving down the row of stalls (chest high, thank you) past a few empty stalls and several grimacing faces, the second to last being The Abbot -- Cold tonight -- -- continuing to the last, Bald Tribunal Member
Gets colder every night
And every day
Never this bad
Taken so much wood out of the structure the surface wind blows right through the colony
Right under the floor -- The Bald Tribunal Member  as a cold breeze runs along the waste trough under the floor and chills the air in his bowl
Right up your bloody backside
Nights like this make me miss plumbing -- Ack --
He feels a  at his bowels - it's not piles
beat
/ What
don't --  -- The Bald Tribunal Monk  as something  him from below -- (note: the left half of the following 5 pages is cut off
have completed the text to the best of my ability
) Something  up his rectum and hooks into his lower intestine
He convulses in spasms of agony
There is a terrible   as the Bald Tribunal Monk is down -- out of frame -- We   down the row of stalls tight on each sitting Monk and see their   as they feel the  drag the Bald Tribunal Monk's body away under them
in his stall He pounds on the wall -- Matthew
Matthew
Jesus, what's wrong
washing his hands, sees all this
Looses control of his bodily functions as blood sprays from the faucet -- In their stalls as the toilets reject a torrent of gore
Blood and viscera spraying the walls -- converting the Abbey into an abattoir
: Angle on the Orbitor Arceon: An orb of wood hands peacefully against a tapestry of celestial seas
Death
'  - Darkness
Somewhere water drips into a puddle
Ripley lays on her side on the floor with her head resting near the hole in the floor
Her eyes are closed
Wherever  go
pushes a crust of bread through the hole
She opens her eyes to look at the food
The White-Haired Man's head appears -- - Take it
Thanks, but no thanks, Anthony
She knows his name
You waiting for meat
They don't bring me meat because they know 'm an android
Really don't need it
Bread's better for you anyway
Harder to digest, so it makes you feel fuller than you are
Not hungry
Anthony takes a bite
Mmmm
Just a little crunchy
Ripley twists onto her back until she's staring up at the ceiling
Waste of time
You don't eat, you'll starve to death, girl
That was the plan when they put me down here
And why should you care
Because 'm a synthetic person you don't think  can care
Believe me, that's a discussion you don't want to have with me
You told me you had a bad experience and a good one with androids -- That's one of each
That means you could go either way
'm tired of talking about this
He pushes the bread towards her again
You've still gotta eat
You gotta fight the bastards -- 'm tired of fighting
Maybe 'll be dead before he finds me
Maybe he won't get the satisfaction
He
You make it sound like this Alien has a personal score to settle with you
The biology you describe:  Queen laying eggs, larvae, drone -- that's very insectoid
Insects usually don't bear grudges
And Androids usually aren't the prisoners of lunatics that believe they're ancient Greeks
Medieval Monks
Whatever
And they've only chose to live the life style, they don't believe they're -- (hears something) What's that
Ripley strains to listen
In the distance: Someone is knocking on the walls
calls out -- - (hoarse) Ripley
He moves down the hallway
his fist against the walls every few feet -- Waits a moment for a reply, then moves on
' Anthony gets off the floor - Moves so she can see into his cell: The walls of Anthony's cell are covered with charcoal sketches - Different versions of demons and the devil
She rolls her eyes - This guy is an Android
Anthony crosses to his cell door, peers through eye level
- John coming towards him, knocking on the doors of boarded up cells
Hey -- you knocking -- cut it out -- You're going to wake everybody up
John moves to Anthony's door
Looks at him through the slot
Anthony recognizes him
Brother John
John unbolts Anthony's door
Picks him up by his cassock -- Anthony
Thought you dead fifteen years
Made too good for that
What're you doing
-- 'm looking -- the Abbot -- What
You look like you've seen the devil
/ He has
Anthony turns to look back at Ripley -- moves aside so John can see her face at the hole -- You mean he -- Anthony turns back - John is gone
As John begins to  the outermosk planks off
was right, wasn't
You've seen it, you've seen the Alien
John pauses at that
His eyes tighten at the memory
can tell you have
was right
It came with me
(to the wall, sharp) Go away
John stops
Looks at the wall
Ripley's voice comes clearly through the wood
Listen, priest, or whatever you are, know what you want
can't help you
couldn't help any of the others
Just stop what you're doing
Go away
Do you understand
John has opened a crack that exposes Ripley's eyes
He stares at her a beat, tries to think of what to reply -- He goes back to work as she continues her confession
You going to stay, Father
But you're not going to talk
Okay
Then you can listen
You should listen
Your Abbot was right
am guilty
But not of heresy
Of murder
John stops again
Just stares at her eyes
The murder of the crew of the Nostromo
That was when  first met the Alien
That reminds him of why he's here
He doubles his efforts at the boards
No, not the same one that's here now
Or maybe it is
Maybe they're all the same one
couldn't save my crew then
should have been able to
But  couldn't
When  went the second time -- Her eyes soften
Then  met Newt
Newt
fought -- stayed alive to keep Newt alive
Hoped maybe that would make up for
She trails off
Slides down the wall
Now he got her too
What's the point
(hard again) Just go away
Leave me in here
If you let me out you'll want me to help you and it will start all over again
Let it end
John breaks through, flickering torch light streams in the mote filled air around him
Ripley looks up at him
can't help you
John, heaving and panting from the excertion
Swallows
Puh
(pant) Please
It never ends
-   - long, twisted-plank-floored corridor with a torch every twenty feet
There is  at the far end
Something is coming towards us -  in and out of the light and shadow -- / Sheep
, Running together
Anthony carries a long wooden staff like a spear
John has his bag
Ripley a torch
We move with them
It must be able to take on some of the characteristics of the animal it grows in
Maybe they are from some sort of aggressive soldier race -- warring parties drop the eggs on opposing planets -- And the alien takes on the form of the creature that finds it, assuming that animal is the dominant life form on the planet
So when it gestates in a man -- Ripley shudders at the memory
It's a biped
In a sheep or cow, a quadroped
Shit
just didn't think it could do that to animals
Wait a minute -  thought you were the expert on this monster
Is that the only reason you came to get me out
Because  knew about this thing
Yes
mean no
mean, that was part of it
Look
never thought you were wrong
was wrong not to say anything
was afraid to speak up
It's hard to be a monk, you know
Ripley stops
Looks at him
long beat
Thank you
If anything, you're honest
We all are
Took vows
don't know about the Abbot
'm sure he thinks what he did was right
Is that speaking up for someone
No
Charity
She smiles
They turn a corner
- This hallway slopes downwards a few degrees
The three find themselves trotting, leaning backward to keep their balance
All right, let's forget about the past and get on to our survival
No more prisoners behind us
Not for years
Okay -- If the Alien's had a few days to lay his eggs our only hope is to get off this - What is this
Arceon
Satellite
Get to my ship and get off this Satellite
We can't
We can't what
Leave Arceon
Can't leave the library -- Tape Library
Books
So
The reason we are out here
Like the Monks who guarded Monastery Libraries on remote islands off England during the First Plague -- There must be books on other colonies -- Some of these books survived the burning of the Libraries of Alexandria
They contain knowledge that exists in no other record
Their value is unestimable
He runs his hand along the spine of the book in his bag
We're supposed to protect them
(to Anthony) And what does an android have to do with all this
He's a spy
The Company planted me here
The Company
What does the Company have to do with this
They built this prison
Prison
Colony
Prison
They are all political heretics
Ripley looks at John
You left that part out
The order was more of a counter culture, a reaction to the Technology that was beginning to take over everyone's lives
It was a simple enough idea - Read, don't watch disk
Walk, don't pump more carbons into the air
The earliest members renounced technology
Started to collect the remaining books
Nobody would have noticed if it hadn't been for the Virus
Your Abbot talked about that
The New Plague
computer virus
bad program
By this time the Corporate structure was transglobal, all the world's data storage systems were linked
It spread through two countries before it was stopped
After a scare like that, thousands flocked to our retreat
People started clamoring for written information
For our books
They abandoned the modern ways -- think  can see how this comes out
They gave up their possessions
This was a threat -- To the Company
They sold the technology
movement to live simply was quickly twisted by Federal agents into a political movement against the Company-controlled World Government
Too much was at stake
Too much profit
We were sentenced as political dissidents
This orbiter is our gulag
All the men were packed up with all our books, and towed into space
Ten thousand men
The eldest died very quickly
The Company had such a sense of irony
Sending you out on this wooden tub
was placed among them as a sensor
Keeps tabs on the movement
So how'd they find out about you
told them
After the supply ship's stopped coming  saw no point in keeping up the charade
Since  was a sort of walking reminder of technology, they cast me down
Join the club
(to John) figured this wasn't planned
You don't have to be a genius to see it wouldn't be prudent to try to preserve man's written works for generations -- without women
John looks embarrassed
And  don't know about your New Plague, but  was just on Earth and everything's fine
John has a doubtful look
was right about the Alien, wasn't
Means  must be right about the Earth
The logic behind her argument is uncomfortable
(beat) Perhaps
That's better than nothing
Come on
They reach the end of the corridor
It opens into -- - An enormous open space between "cell blocks
" The Wall behind them is honey-combed with corridor openings going up four stories, connected by aged, warped wooden ladders reminiscent of Indian cave dwellings
Only wooden
The room stretches several football field lengths ahead of them -- falling off into gloom
They stand silent for a moment, dwarfed by the size of the room and the task ahead of them
Finally -- At any rate, let's forget about the Earth completely - whether you're right or 'm right what's important is getting the hell out of here
From here my ship is
John points up at the ceiling
In Heaven
Right
And this is
Anthony and John nod
This orbiter was patterned after a medieval concept of the universe -- (makes a circle in the air) They call the top half "Heaven - " The Abbey, the fields -- The bottom half is "Hell
"  Where we are
Aptly named
What's in the middle
The sea
Really
Work with me here
How far is it back to the surface of the planet
As a stone falls --- Five miles through the center
And the elevator -- the thing they lowered me down in
Ropes cut
It's smart
First he cuts their escape off, then works his way down through the monastery level by level until there isn't a thing left alive
Interesting
Well, you start appreciating him more than me and 'll find a way to shut you down, capisce, Andy
How do we get up
There are ladders
She stops
John and Anthony continue on a few steps and then stop and walk back to her
Five miles with the Alien between us and there
Good luck, boys
She turns and heads back towards her cell -- John catches her shoulder -- You can't -- Can't what
Not help you go to your deaths
've had my fill of that
need you
can't do it alone
've fought these creatures twice before
It take a lot to kill these things
Heavy artillery
We don't have weapons here
How about something we can make weapons from
Do you have anything like that -- any modern things here
John  his head vehemently -- We renounced technology
It was those things that caused the Plague
This is a man-made planet
Something has to be recirculating your air, your water
God
Please
don't know
just took it for granted
Most people do
Without some sort of technology we haven't got a chance
From behind them: There is technology
John and Ripley turn to look at him
room
Technology room
Fresh air and water come out
An atmosphere processing plant -- The heart and lungs of Arceon
Where is it
One level beneath the underground sea
That's five levels up -- (points into the gloom) On the other side of the orbiter
John looks at Ripley -- chance
Ripley looks from John's earnest face to the darkness and back
All right
You've got me - so far
But here's the deal:   don't know how many of your brethren are going to be alive when we get up there, but if we make it to my ship, you're all coming with me
We'll take as many of your precious books as we can carry, but we're going
'm not going to fight this thing again to end up alone again
Understand
John nods his head
We're all dead anyway
We might as well go fi -- She feels a  in her midsection -- Doubles over
Anthony and John each take an arm -- Ugh - 'm all right
She takes a deep breath
Still thawing out
hate hyper sleep
Come on
: -   - The formerly idyllic landscape has been reduced to a scorched battlefield
Wooden huts leveled
Small fires dot the land
The air thick with ash and greasy smoke
swarm across the countryside like ants on a mound of spilt sugar
In one hand a taper or torch held high, in the other hand their : scythe, pitchfork, hoe, whatever they could get ahold of, seem pitifully out of place
Some pound sharpened stakes into the ground, others push carts into rough barricades
"Platoon" of Monks huddle around trap doors open on the wooden "ground
"  More ladders
They climb down to -- - Just beneath the Monastery level of the satellite: an Underground Wheatfield
Tall golden grass stretches out for miles, swaying gently around huge wooden columns that support the Abbey fifty feet above -- lattice-work of suspended troughs and wooden pipes -- the "plumbing," the understructure, of the Monastery
Descend the ladders single file
Fear is in all of their faces though most have only heard the stories
They move cautiously into the wheat
Spread out through the field in the jaggedly drawn skirmish line
The Bald Tribunal Monk's dried blood splattered on his cassock, stands atop an empty wooden wagon
From this vantage point he watches and  their way forward leaving trails through the high grass
Their attempt at an orderly progression quickly falls apart as they get strung out all over the field
(sotto) Stay together
Together
Then another movement catches the Abbot's eye -- of the Monks - the wheat waves against the wind
Begins to ripple -- the wheat flattens
a  forms
SomeTHING is  in the long grass
Moving towards the Lead Monk --
The Abbot opens his mouth as if to shout a warning - even though the Monk closest to the moving trail is too far away to hear him - before he can make a sound The Alien closes the gap - Feeling horribly helpless he can only watch as -Aa -
The Lead Monk gives one strangled  before he disappears beneath the surface of the long grass
His taper falls among the long, dry stalks -- begins to
The Abbot can see the trail moving towards his men before they can
He finds his voice: Run
The Monks in the field turn from the spot where the Monk screamed towards the Abbot --    to the now moving again trail -- No -
The -- The Alien hits the skirmish line at a flanking angle -- through five Monks like a scythe through wheat
His tail, arms  out -- their spines like kindling
Lost torches ignite the wheat
The field
Smoke fills the air
In the smoky commotion the Monks break rank and start running
Weapons in front of them --  wildly -- Screaming
Crying
One Frightened Monk runs through another with his pitchfork
Another hears something crashing through the grass towards him and buries his scythe in his best friend's chest
And through it all the Alien seems to be everywhere
Using the chalky smoke for cover as it  and  its way across the field -- Frozen in terror to the spot
Squints through the smoke to see what has happened to his flock
Hears the  of defeat rising up from the wounded
The waving grass is flattened as The Alien moves towards him -- He can finally pry himself from his perch on the wagon
He climbs down
As his feet hit the wooden floor he feels a shadow fall over him
The little hairs on the back of his neck stand up
He slowly turns
Rises out of the grass in front of the Holy Man
Slowly rises up to its height of almost three meters
It's long, smooth head is no longer black and slimy
It is golden
It's cable-like arms are sheathed in a straw-like covering
It has adapted to the environment of the wheat field
Its now grass-like lips draw back into a ghastly parody of a smile
The Abbot  and
/ It isn't your fault, you know
- They move across the huge room
Anthony a few paces ahead
Their candles throwing only enough light to see several yards
Wind whistles through the huge room, timbers creaking like some gigantic old house settling
What
Those things you said before -- Ripley remembers her "confession
" read about it in psychology books
Sometimes when people outlive someone they cared for, they transfer some of the guilt for that person's death to themselves
got a belly full of that from the Psychtechs when  was on Earth
Yeah
"Survivor Guilt syndrome," or something like that
But that's not what  was thinking about
was thinking about my "friend" up there
She looks up
He was on the pod
He killed Newt but not me
Why not me
It's almost like he's playing with me
Maybe they have some sort of race memory
Maybe he knows what  did to his "mother
" That's why he didn't just kill me
That would be too easy
He has to torment me
You make it sound human
Hell,  don't know what it is
John unconsiously fingers his book
think  do
- -   - At the end of the space a rough hewn wooden ladder leads to another block of cell corridors four stories up
Years of damp air have warped the ladder
Ripley leads the way, torch in her left hand
They climb
-   - Dark
Ripley is the first one up
She raises her torch and heads down the new corridor alone
The cells here have no doors
She holds her torch in one -- An old skeleton sits in quiet contemplation
John is just climbing off, Anthony right behind him
Anthony is winded
He reaches up for a helping hand
John looks back and sees that Ripley has moved ahead without them, then reaches down to help Anthony
Their hands clasp -- "" He is seemingly standing in an open field, sheep grazing peacefully at his side
he is  by a horde of Medieval demons
Fish faced demons
Man-headed bird demons
They fly about him, grab hold of his limbs
The Sheep nearest him opens it's mouth to reveal a horde of razor sharp fangs,      -- Anthony  -
Down the corridor  the scream, turns back -- sees Anthony fighting with himself, struggling against John's grasp - Balanced precariously on the top of the ladder in the real world as he fights against the demons in his android mind -- He  -- Pulls his left ankle out of the grasp of the   -- the ladder - forty foot drop waiting below him
Struggles to keep his death grip on Anthony's hand
It's all that keeps Anthony from falling back down the shaft -- Jesus Christ
Ripleeeee -
He  with all his might
a horrible - grasping his hand in its beak -- through his wrist
He waves his staff in the air -- He aims for its head: -
John's hand with his staff -- John  in pain -   -- Anthony     , arms waving in the air -- Ripley's hands   -- Anthony's cassock -- his fall
Anthony's eyes open wide at the sight of this new horror -- terrible, wet, black cable-armed  that's latched itself onto his cassock -- Long, shiny head
Ripley has become the Alien
Anthony  the Creature with his staff -- Ripley on the head
Again
In the face
John tries to take hold of Anthony's staff arm -- The cane  against the side of his head, knocking him back
Ripley sets her feet and pulls on Anthony's cassock -- Opens her mouth -  -- sees the terrible Alien open it's maw to devour him
His staff connects with the bridge of Ripley's nose
She sees flashes of light -- loses her balance -- Pitches forward, starts to go over with Anthony -- Wraps his arms around the struggling pair and like a sumo wrestler  and  backwards - carrying the three of them into the corridor --
They land on the floor in a heap
Anthony continues to   -- Ripley and John pin him to the floor between them
Finally, the vision leaves him
He loses consciousness
Breathing heavy - opens his eyes -- He's staring right into Ripley's face
Less than an inch away
He's laying on top of her
She's breathing heavy too
long, uncomfortable moment
Thanks
You're welcome
They roll off each other
Her hand goes up to her nose
Blood
'm all right
John reaches into his bag, withdraws a small cotton bag
Hold this against your nose
It'll stop the flow
She looks over at him questioningly
'm a doctor
She holds the small bag against her nose
The bleeding stops
They move over to Anthony - try to help him to his feet
He shakes them off
No - please
Just let me sit
Awhile
He rubs his temples
White, milk-like sweat runs down his cheek
Damn it
What was that
The reason 'm down here
John points to his own eyes
Visions
Dreams
Androids can't dream
That's probably what they thought when they built me
But my brain is cyber- organic - patterned after the human brain - it functions the same way a human brain does
It accumulates random images and sensations during waking hours, but unlike the human brain that sloughs them off during sleep -- Androids don't sleep
Right
Maybe they've fixed this on later models, but  don't
Do you know what happens to the human brain when it is deprived of sleep
It starts to run off the dreams while you're awake, as hallucinations
Same thing with me
For twenty years  absorbed data on this planetoid
little after we lost contact with Earth the visions started
They thought  was insane
had to explain that it was because  was an android
They liked that even less
What did you see
What  always see
Images of Monsters
Demons
They're portents
They stand for an evil yet to come
Just images 've absorbed from those old books and have no way to get rid of
saw the inside of your cell
(shrugs) My head is full of them
try to get them out any way  can
His eyelids droop
You need sleep
know that
'll settle for rest
He closes his eyes
Ripley recovers the torch
Stay with him
Ripley tried to stand - John takes her arm, pulls her down
No
We all need rest
You especially
Ripley considers him
Doctor's orders
She smiles and sits
Besides, you see what happens when you get ahead of us
We should stay together
All right
He's still above us, anyway
What do you mean
've faced this evil twice before - guess 've gotten sensitive to it -- (beat) You're really a Doctor
John pats his canvas bag
See my bag
What's that book
Just a book
don't buy "just a book" from a guy who says we can't leave the planet without the library
It's just
a medical book  might need
You don't have any food in there, do you
Only if you can eat bandages
Ripley rubs her midsection
In a few hours that's going to sound good
Going in and out of suspended animation - Christ  probably haven't eaten in a year
(without opening eyes) You should've eaten the bread
Rest
Ripley lets her head loll back against the wall
Closes her eyes
Time passes
Her brow knits
John sees this
You all right
Aces
You weren't hurt when  landed on you
Bruised a rib
He reaches over and puts his hands beneath her cassock
Feels her midsection
His hands are warm
Are you sure you're a doctor
He withdraws his hands
Sort of
My father passed on when we first came here
The Abbey's Physician - Father Anselm - took me in
He really raised me -- (pause) Taught me what he could before he passed away
He was schooled on Earth
Well, 'm just hungry
You haven't eaten since  took you out of your tube
You did that
She reaches out and takes hold of his hands
Turns them over
You burned yourself on the escape pod
Her hands on his makes him feel
uncomfortable
Thank you,  guess
They look into each other's eyes -- / You should've eaten the bread
Ripley, embarrassed, releases his hands
Looks at Anthony
He's trying to stand
Enough rest
There's beasties afoot
They start into
Ceiling so low their torches must be held out in front of them
Ripley makes an effort not to move faster than the two monks
great long ladder hanging in the middle of nowhere
Seems at least a mile long
The group climbs
Liquid drips through the ceiling planks over head
Falls into  puddles on the slanted floor
John kneels, dips his fingertips -- Blood
(sniffs) Mixed with sea water
We're getting close to the center of the arc -- near the sea
Blood
Getting close
John  somthing
Raises his hand -- "stop" The group stops
Flatten themselves against the wall
John takes Anthony's staff
Moves forward with it held out in front of him
around a blind corner -- something against the wall -- Thump
It struggles -- Ripley and Anthony run up -- raise their tapers -- Revealing: The Abbot
Cassock torn, dirty
Hair, eyes wild
Anthony's staff across his throat
John pulls back
Father -- (sarcastic) What are you doing down here, father
You look like you've seen something that doesn't exist
The Abbot runs his fingers through his hair
Smoothes it down
was their spiritual leader
was not prepared to lead them in battle
Not against that thing
No one could be
thought you said the evil was inside me -- that sealing me up was the answer to all your problems
Destruction
The destruction  brought to us
only tried to warn you
What are you doing with this woman --
We are going to the Technology Room
Trying to find some way to fight -- You don't join the devil to fight the devil
She's helping us -- Look who defends the deceiver -- the one who isn't even human
John, can't you see what is happening
On ancient Earth, during the Black Death - many believed that God had abandoned them, so they appealed to the Devil
Flocked to him hoping to save their bodies - losing their souls in the bargain
Father, we're all on the run from the same monster so let's not resort to the fire and brimstone routine
've been enlightened about your "movement
" Pretty funny to be tried for heresy on a planet of heretics
Please
The time for pretense is past
All right
was trying to keep you quiet
Sir --
do what  have to do to keep the Brotherhood together
We all gave up believing in Earth a long time ago
How do you think they would feel if told their exiled was in vain
That the holocaust they were trying to avoid never occured
Those men up there have grown to live with it
And with you as their leader
The Abbot smiles
Ripley is sharp
You threatened the status quo
So you, protector of knowledge and truth, lied to them
Only about you
The rest  still believe
If Earth still orbits its sun there is no way it could have survived being reduced to Barbarism
You're as bad as the Company
Ripley -- That's why you ran
After all your talk death stared you in the face and you were afraid
Not afraid of death
The Alien
The Organism
The Devil
The now four refugees work their way into the final corridor
Dark
Turns at sharp angles
Blind alleys
The floor is uneven, wood aged and twisted
Warped by years of water dripping from above
The group strings out as it moves into the darkness, candles held high
Bringing up the rear, puts his walking stick down -- Everybody stops at the sound
What was that
Anthony pulls his stick from the grasp of a-- Man trap
They lower their candles
Look to: Interspersed throughout the timbers -- Spring jawed, steel toothed,
Rusted
Open
And all around them
In case anyone tried to get in and tamper with the technology
The four of them are standing in the middle of a mine-field of man traps
Nobody moves
What do we do
Don't move
Don't breath
We can't just stand here and wait
Floor's too unstable to try to walk around them
John pulls a loose board from the corridor wall
Turns and kneels at the trap in front of him
Pokes the end of the board into the jaws
The others jump at the sound -- John - what are you doing
John pulls the stick out of the rusted jaws
Moves to the next trap -- Snap
He's thinking like a leader
Everyone: Grab wood
Spring the traps
Clear a path
(proud of him) Good work, Father John
Brother
Brother
Let's go
Ripley pulls a plank from the wall next to her
Exposes a bit of the surface underneath -- It's
She touches the cool, familiar material
Smiles
Now she knows this is not a dream
She turns and  the trap in front of her -- Slowly make their way down the corridor, one hand holding a candle high, the other poking a piece of wood into the trap in front of them
-
walking carefully around the yet unfired traps
huge wooden door with no knob or handle
Looks like it could almost be part of the wall
John and Ripley are the first to it
They put down their planks and begin to feel around the edges of the door for some purchase
The Abbot joins them
Anthony lags behind
He senses a presence in the hallway
Hears a sound behind him
We see a  of something -- He turns towards the sound -- Empty hallway
He thinks
Starts forward again -- with his ear cocked to the rear
Ripley, John and The Abbot knock on the door, walls
Ripley leans her head against the wall in frustration and exhaustion
To get this far, and be locked out
She feels sick to her stomach
How long since she had food
She looks over at John
He is staring at her
He turns red at being caught
Cute
just - are you allright
Tied
Without sleep, food --  just feel my age
(smiles) Figuring hyperspace time, 'm almost a hundred
She wipes her brow and goes back to knocking
Hello
The wall beneath his fist sounds hollow
Fingernails find the edge of the plank and pull -- The plank slides aside on tiny, rusty pneumatic pistons
primitive
Circa late twentieth century
think this is it
Ripley and the Abbot move over to see
Technology
Yeah - a hundred years ago
An antique
(to Ripley) Go ahead
Go ahead and what
Open the door, woman
'll get to it, but listen to me -- you may dress like you're living in the middle ages but you can't treat me like your chambermaid, or whatever Monks had
- Hears the sound again
Turns
Nothing again
He pauses
Turns back quickly -- The wooden wall  - steps forward -- Adapted itself to look like
It's body changes -- transmutes -- Cable-like sinew snaking over grained limbs to approximate the more traditional bio- mechnoid alien appearance
The weary android sees the Alien as a conglommoration of his many Medieval images of demons
He hears the Alien's hollow, raspy breath
It glides towards him
Anthony steps back directly    as his mind goes -- The   spring shut on his left ankle
Milky blood-fluid starts to flow
He finds himself in the same predicament as his vision -- Ankle pinned, the Alien's appendages circling him -- He screams
--
Ripley is trying to work
She punches numbers into the keyboard
She is too exhausted to see straight
They  the scream -- John  back -- Traps  around him -- Ripley turns towards the sound -- The Abbot pushes her back to the keyboard -- Ripley knits her brows
Forces herself to focus
Her fingers punch the keys
Steps towards Anthony -- Snap-snap---
Traps snap closed on its tail, its legs -- - His cassock is snagged in a trap
He  right out of it -- Anthony is in the clutches of the Alien
He  at the Beast with his staff, but his blows fall like drops of rain on an elephant
The Alien  him up to face him
Anthony  as his left leg is stretched agsinst the tension of the trap's chain -- Blood pouring as white ribbons from his almost severed ankle
Anthony drops his staff and grabs each of the alien's arms with his own android arms
His extra-human strength keeps them from squeezing him any tighter, but he cannot avert his gaze from the smooth, eyeless face
The Alien considers him
Its thin, almost translucent lips pull back to reveal rows of splinter-like teeth
The jaws spread, making room for the distended tongue: The Alien  -- Anthony's  with a thin stream of   -- Artificial skin    -- Picks up Anthony's staff
Begins to  away at the demon
Ripley is getting no response from the keyboard
What's wrong
Ripley slides the keyboard out of the wall compartment
The wires are so old they've broken
Shit
She  the ends off the wires - spits out the insulation
the bare wire ends together
Sweat runs into her eyes
the Alien with Anthony's staff -- Again
Again
The creature will not let Anthony go
The Android writhes in its grasp, his face now a blistered, pulpy mass, eyes gone
Finishes hot wiring
The keyboard hums to life
Her fingers  across the keys -- Tail wraps around John's waist -- Pulls him towards it -- him - turns him upside down -- Lips   -- John's hands  at the floor -- Sharp metal teeth  -- Lights: Ripley's head whips towards the corridor -- His hand closes around the end of one of the traps -- He brings it up -- It  closed on the Alien's extended Tongue -
The Beast bellows
Whips its head from side to side -- Can't shake off the trap -- sprays out --
Lands as pools of  on the wooden floor
Opens with a strained blast of dust -- -
The Abbot  inside -- It's open
Anthony's ankle out of his trap
Scoops up his staff, drags the moaning Android -- Back up the corridor -- Stands in open Technology Room doorway -- Close it -- close it -- it's coming - We wait
John
John and Anthony appear out of the shadows -- Run/hobble towards the door -- Acid Blood  the traps' steel jaws
itself free
Head whips towards the escaping Monks -- if it had eyes they would narrow to slits in anger -- up the hall -- Follows John and Anthony into the Technology Room
On the other side of the doorway: another keyboard
She punches keys -- Hurry -- Yards away -- Limping
Hissing
Acceptance tone "bings
" The Door starts to slide down -- The Alien is feet away -- The door seats itself closed with a solid
Ripley, panting, rests eyes closed against the rough wooden door
beat
She turns to the room for the first time and finds -- Real Man of LaMancha wood and cloth windmills
Two story high arms slowly rotating
Moving enormous volumes of air through the wind tunnel-like room
As far as the eye can see
Turning, creaking
But no electronics
No radio
No weapons
This is the Technology Room
Ripley collapses to the floor and loses consciousness
: #4 () Yellow warning lights
Those goddamned  are flickering on and off
Steam blasts out overhead pipes
The blue-spark pilot light muzzles of a   shyly pokes out from behind a console
It's owner cautiously follows
She's breathing heavy
She's wearing a sweat soaked tank top
Her eyes flit from side to side
Then up
Then down
She pokes the weapon out ahead of her and moves into the pod
She silently crosses the distance to Newt's sleep tube: Newt sleeps peacefully
Ripley allows herself one maternal smile, then remembers
Her grip  in the Flame Thrower in her hands
She flips a switch to
Moves around the sleep tubes
noise to her left
She  -- Pulls the trigger on the flame thrower -- click
Nothing
She tries again -- a half-hearted burp, but no flame
She begins to panic -- Senses the Alien's presence
Looks left, right, up - no Alien
Looks down: The Alien's tail is
She turns -- Right into it's grasp
The useless flamethrower  across the floor
She  the beast with balled up fists
No
beat you
beat you mother fucker
The Alien spins her -- pushes her over across the sleep tube -- Like it's taking her from behind
Ripley looks down into the sleep tube: Newt is gone
Her doll's head lays in a pool of blood
The Alien wraps his arms around Ripley
Thin lips pull back for a kiss
She
-  - Ripley opens her eyes
She's still in the room with the windmills
Somehow this place seems less real than her dream
She looks around: John is sitting next to her, writing on a piece of parchment
He smiles a relieved smile
thought we'd lost you
What are you writing
Last will and testament
(beat) Just kidding
She looks to her left: Anthony is lying on his back, cotton bandage wrapped around his eyes
His ankle is a swollen mess
Wires are hanging out
Is he --
Resting
(shakes his head) He'll be fine
No  won't
He's a terrible liar
'm sorry
It's ironic
guess my visions were prescience after all
How will  ever resolve that with my artifical con- science
creaking floorboard to Ripley's right draws her attention to The Abbot
He's pacing
Do you see what you've delivered us into
Yeah
Lead me not into temptation to kick your -- ahh -- Ripley tries to stand - her head spins
Oh shit
The entire room  with the rhythm of the wind
Where is the Big Boy -
The Abbot points to the door
On the other side of that door
Waiting for us to starve to death
Ripley moves to the door and feels it's cold surface
It's playing with us
It could get in here any time it wants
Why should he enter
He knows that one of the people in this room is in league with him
Sir
We're all in the same coracle, so to speak
Maybe more than one of us
Let's talk about the facts, Mr
Abbot
She looks at the windmills
This is your technology
Even this is forbidden to us
Well then, the facts are that we're screwed
She moves into the room
Walks around one of the Windmills
An Eco system
Nothing to recycle your atmosphere except the green plants
Winds generated down here -- (looks at the floor) Windmills use the natural surface winds to turn wheels underground, create tides on the seas to recirculate your water
More than that
There are pumps beneath the floor -  can feel their vibration
Probably pumping this air through charcoal filters
It gets colder all the time here, right
John looks at her questioningly
Yes
Your wood burning fires throw soot into the atmosphere, building the cloud layer - cutting off the sun's rays - cooling the planet, forcing you to burn more wood
The Greenhouse Effect
It's how the Earth almost destroyed itself in the late 20th century
Don't you see
This is a planet set to self destruct
Not in ten minutes or two hours but soon
Your atmosphere here is finite
If the plants die the fires will eat up all the oxygen - this planetoid will be dead - Everyone will die
The Abbot has the look of a man who has been beaten in the last few meters of a Marathon
It's here
was just hoping  would be dead long before it came to this
What
We're supposed to die here
That's the point
Wait a minute -- you were exiled --
The punishment for our crime was death
Anthony sits up
This planet is the supreme triumph of planned obsolesence
certain amount of primitive materials with an atmosphere processing system as fragile as a real environment but not replenishable
The Abbot has a faraway look in his eyes
Poetic justice for the anti-technologists
The Company's best work
You know,  used to be a corporate executive
Middle range Then my wife got hit by a speed craft
chucked it all and joined the order
Be a monk -- see the world
Being here, being chairman of the board
No, now  understand why  landed here
To join you happy lunatics in your deaths
Ripley moves away
John starts after her
Ripley, wait -- The Abbot stands, blocks his way
Where can she go
She's trapped
(beat) Trapped inside her own prison
prison in her mind
Inside her mind
Dancing
Sparklets of light - dance with the june bugs in the recesses of ourmindstheyare coming to danceintheshadowof
John and Ripley turn to look at the Abbot
He begins to speak faster
Faster
He shakes
Vibrates is more accurate -- trickle of  runs from his left ear
RidingthewildwindsofchangeNoescapeNo escapeforthewickedEvilEvilthynameis woman

Heiscoming foryouuuuuuuuu --* ---
The Abbot's   --
Like a ripe melon dropped ten stories onto pavement
Blood, bone, hair and brain matter  John
John
Is all that sits atop the blood spurting neck of the Abbot
It keeps it's hold on the Abbot's spinal cord -- The Abbot's body continues to stagger around, arms jerking mechanically as lack of fresh nerve impulses from the brain works its way through the system
Ripley
The Infant Alien-headed corpse stumbles towards her -- She plucks Anthony's staff from the floor and  -- -- Like a child hitting a baseball from a  -- - -
the Chest/head burster across the room -- It hits the floor
Scuttles down into where the Windmills meet the floor
Disappears
It came out of his fucking head
didn't have to see that to know what that means
He sent him to us
That bastard outside
can't get away from him
He's fucking with my mind
He's my punishment
'm confused
Before you said it came out of the torso, not the head -- don't feel like a discussion of Alien biology
John comes up next to her
Ripley, don't -- She pushes him away and sinks to the floor
should just wait for the air to run out
believe -  know - that we can win -- there is an answer in our books
Your books
Your books are gone, Brother
Your world is gone
Once that thing starts to lay its eggs, all your brothers - if they aren't already - are dead
If that's true, then all of us, the books, are consigned to ashes
He clasps his hands and bows his head
The Abbot's blood drips off his hands
Plip - plop
Into a little puddle at Ripley's feet
She stares at the blood
Aahk
Feels the  again
Runs her hand across her chest
/ Ripley
What
There are several inconsistancies between this and the other Aliens you described
Give it up
think this is important
This may help us fight it
The creature that  fought in the hall - when  first saw it, it had camoflaged itself to look like wood
Ripley looks up
Wood
When  saw it in my room it looked the way it did before -- black, mechanical -- unless that was a dream
don't think it was
think that this creature, if it is the efficient predator that you say it is, has the ability to adapt to its environment
Then the reason they've always looked the same to me is that  only ever saw them in the same environment
Or this may be an as yet unseen stage of development -- you saw a queen -- This could be like a King ant -- more highly advanced than the drone, bred for survival -
How does this explain the thing that came out of the ewe's chest
The Abbot's head
Maybe it can deposit different types of eggs
The chest burster is probably dormant until the host eats - The first one  ever saw came out of Kane after he started to eat -- And in one horrible moment she realizes: She hasn't eaten
The pain in her chest
No
Anthony "looks" towards her - does he realize as well
No what
No, we're not beat yet, Father -- Brother -- Ripley gets up
Brother
Not yet
If he's taunting me, then maybe we can use that
We can beat this bastard
We can get to my ship
We can live
: John stands by a ladder that runs up to a trap door in the ceiling
Holds a torch
Ripley is on the ground with Anthony, his injured leg splayed out in front of him
Skin is palid
Don't have second thoughts
Blind and crippled  would only slow you down
Give him time to figure out what you're doing
Just leave me my staff
Okay
Good luck
She shakes his hand
He pulls her closer
Anthony's empty eye sockets seem to see as he looks at Ripley
Ripley,  know
Good luck
Sit tight
Ripley crosses to John
Poised at the bottom of the ladder they look up at the trap door on the ceiling
He could be waiting on the other side of that door
We might not get ten feet before he kills the three of us
He shakes his head
We had better go, then
He smiles
She smiles back
They move up the ladder
It leads up a damp, short shaft, walls  with algae, to - The ladder shaft opens onto a barnacled pier
Ripley and John climb out onto the wooden structure
Before them: stretches the width of the entire planet, over five miles across
The floor of the lowest level of the top half of the orbiter makes a ceiling that looms a hundred feet overhead
The water sparkles with a golden glow
Must be day on the surface of the planet
Where is the light coming from
Mirrors
Reflect the outside light down great shafts -- through lenses
That's what they make in the glass factory
Lenses
Look -- She turns: Lit from within by daylight beaming down from above -- pours into the sea a short distance from them
Opens to the surface
Water flows in and out
don't know how
There's one at either end
came down on the other side
What do we do
John points to three small leather and wood coracles bobbing at the end of their ropes
We cross
- Anthony has dragged himself to a sitting position against the bottom of one of the windmills
He winces as he prods his tender ankle with the end of his staff
It
The large canvas arms of the windmill rotate above his head
The wind blows through his hair
Feels good
Anthony reaches up and waves his hand of his "eyes
" Now the seer can only see what God wants him to
Forty years on a planet of Monks and 've finally found religion
floor board
Anthony strains to hear: John
Ripley
He knows it is not
Well come then
haven't got forever
shadow falls across his face
He can feel it
He doesn't have to see what is here
- The leather boat makes its way across the sea
John rows while Ripley holds the torch aloft
As night falls she takes the oars
The Ocean is dead calm
The coracle glides across the glass- like surface
John flexes his scarred fingers
Your hands okay
They'll be fine
You've been on a boat before
Ripley squints ahead of them
The ocean seems to go on forever
was a warrant officer on a ship -- but  did all my sailing in space
Father Anselm used to take me on his coracle when  was little
Ripley leans forward - scans his face
How old were you when they towed this satellite out here
Five
The Abbot said they put us to sleep for the thirty years it took to get here
We've had almost forty more
Until now
What happened to your mother
Never had one
mean, never knew her
mean,  did, once
She left my father when he joined the movement
If she hadn't  wouldn't be here
They kept the other children with the women, on Earth
That was too long ago now
Like a dream
Ripley's face grows strangely dark
She turns to the water
Did you know that  was a mother
The girl in the ship with -
No
On Earth
never mentioned my daughter
My daughter
have - had guess, by now - a daughter on Earth
Kathy
She was nine when  signed on to the Nostromo
Mommy will be home before you know it  said
My shares would have set us up good
Then  lost sixty years floating around in a rescue pod
Thanks to the Alien
came home to face a bitter, 70 year old woman
My daughter
little girl who's mother never came home
Jesus Christ
They said  should have been happy to be alive
Funny, huh
That's why  went back the second time
Not so  could fight it -- You can't fight it -- So could let it kill me
She rubs her chest -- You didn't choose to get lost in space
Thanks for the try Father -- Brother
Brother, but 'm not looking for absolution
couldn't be a good mother to my daughter
couldn't be a good mother to Newt
But can be a good mother to you
can make sure you survive
Suddenly they feel rain -- Ripley holds out her hand
Her eyes open wide at what she sees
John takes the oars as she holds the torch over the side: The Ocean has become red with
Blood  down from the ceiling around them
Blood
John looks up
From the levels above
His face goes white
He must have slaughtered all -- Don't think about it
Don't think about what's up there
Just row
As Ripley takes the torch away from the water, tiny ripples move across the surface
She doesn't notice
Passes underneath the boat
swimming
The Alien
Thanks to the reflective qualities of water, it appears
Dwarfs their coracle
- All the windmills are
Flaming arms lazily turning
Anthony is not in sight
Whoosh
Whoosh
- Another dock with ladders going up and down
Ripley and John climb out of the coracle
Don't waste time tying off
They go  -- hundred foot climb
The wood is twisted
Rungs have been torn away in some places
They pull themselves up sections that have only the tiniest foothold
The temperature rises as they do
Sweat runs into their eyes
Soon they can see the floor above them: by intense heat
They climb
- Ripley and John come up from the level below
Holy shit
John crosses himself
Another testament to the terrible battle with the Alien
Reduced to just a huge, blackened floor
All the crops burned to ash -- Their charred stalks mingled with the corpses of roasted Monks
Their nostrils assailed by the stench of the dead -- Ripley would puke if she had any food in her body
There's Andrew
And Raphael
Peter
Stop
How far
We're right below the Abbey now
They cross the smoldering field
The scorched floor threatens to give way under John's feet -- Ripley pull him to one side
Heaven has become
The ground, the buildings, the Sky-timber - all blackened
burn everywhere
Air choked with gray smoke and dust pouring in from the Orbiter's surface through rends in the vaulted ceiling
Climb through a hole where a trap door has been torn off it's hinges
They look at the grim tableau: Monks impaled on their own pikes
Tangled together in their own pungy stakes
Alien cocoon material cobwebbed over their bodies
Flickering fires lit the first few floor windows
Ripley takes a step towards it -- Reaches back and pulls John
- The Glass furnace boils almost to the point of overflow
Small fires burn out of control around the room
Finished glass pieces  from the heat
Ripley and John enter
This is the glassworks
They have tools here -- (spots) Kyle -- He runs across the room -- Sits calmly at the Marver table
He places playing cards on the table in front of him
Solitaire
He sings to himself quietly
(sotto) Can't see my baby
Don't see my baby
Bay be
John grabs him by the lapels - pulls him to his feet
The playing cards fall to the floor -- Kyle watches them, not John
Kyle
Brother Kyle
Cards on the floor, fifty two pickup
Black king on red queen, put the ace up -- John  him
Kyle goddammit
Ripley moves closer
John - it's too late -- Kyle begins to sing faster
Faster
Ace up
Put the ace up
Redaceupup
Blackaceup
Up
Pup-pup-pup-chaka- boomloommawhacka -- Booomalooma looma -- Ripley and John look at each other
They know what this means
John pulls a length of rope off a nearby table
Moves in front of Kyle
Looks into his glassy eyes
tear runs down his cheek
Keep singing, my friend
John loops the rope around Kyle's neck
Strangles him
Eases the lifeless body to the floor
Stares at it
Pulls a blowing iron from the rack
Feels its weight and balance
reasonable weapon
She crosses to John
killed him
'm a doctor and killed him
You had to
You're supposed to end suffering
She hands him a pontil, a pointed iron spear used to form the molten glass shapes
Let's get the hell out of here
- Ripley and John move up the stairs
Flickering orange lit from below
Smoke and soot rise from the first on the lower floors
- They enter carefully
The room is exactly as John left it, books out of shelves, hanging on their chains
He's made a mess
John pushes ahead of her
No
He hasn't been up here yet did this
He moves to the nearest shelf and uses his pontil to pry open the lock -- Here - philosophy - we'll start here -- --
flies out from between the stacks -- Knocks John to the floor -- Licks his face
Mattias
The happy dog leaps all over his master
He waited
Ripley, this is Mattias
My dog
Good fellow
Ripley crosses to them
'm glad
Really
But we've probably only got a few minutes before this entire place goes up in flames
Just grab whatever books you want and -- Ripley leans in to pet Mattias
Mattias draws his lip back
Growls
He's looking over Ripley's shoulder
She turns around slowly
Standing in the open doorway
It's in bad shape from the man traps
Lost a foot
Tongue hanging out, useless
Parts of it look like wood
Parts of it look like wheat
It carries Anthony's waterlogged, limp body -- off his head like a grape from the bunch
Tosses the corpse at Ripley's feet
could swear it's trying to smile
Back against the book stacks
John grabs Mattias' collar
The Dog  at the Alien intruder
Easy, boy
Is there another way out
Not that will do us any good
Limps into the room dragging one foot
It's breathing is labored
Dripping acid blood leaves a thin trail of fire behind it
We hurt it
The Alien draws itself up to its full height -- Even wounded it is one dangerous mother fucker
You wanna give it a bandage
Look -- Where is my ship from here
On the roof directly above this room
Here's the plan -- But the books -- Forget the books
Mattias pulls free from John's grasp -- Runs to the Alien -- Shit
Snaps and barks at the Alien -- Leaping about to dodge its claws
Draws its attention -- at the Alien
It is trying to spear the dog with its tail
John swings the iron rod --  -
the Alien across the back of its bulbous head -- It turns to him -- -
Ripley  the blowing iron into the Alien's torso
His acid blood  out the end of the hollow tube -- Ripley's cassock - she  it off -- John grabs Mattias -- pulls him back
The Alien  in a circle -- Blood  around him - Creating a    about him -- the books -- No
Don't --
John steps forward -- Ripley grabs for him -- The   through the wooden floor -- The Alien, John and Ripley  down -
the next floor -- The Alien  into the molten glass vat -- - arms flailing as it sinks beneath the surface of the thousand degree liquid
Finds himself  over the bubbling glass vat - Caught - on the Flying Fox rope
Five feet away - the ledge the Flying Fox is launched from
He looks down: He can see the huge open vat of molten glass below him
To its right, the Water   - a large wine cask-looking affair where finished pieces are cooled
He looks up: Ripley holding onto the edge of the broken floor above
Are you all right
Ripley grunts an affirmative response
At least is she falls, it will only be a twenty-foot drop to the floor
John is looking at instant par-boiling
John starts to move hand over hand  the rope
He begins to sweat
drop of sweat falls
as it hits the surface of the molten glass -- Tries to pull herself up to the floor above -- The next level is a raging fire
She can only hang and
She  -
Falls the two stories
Bends her knees and  on impact
Has reached the ledge overlooking the furnace
He stands
Sees Ripley slowly rising -- Ripley -
Ripley shakily gets to her feet
Hops on one foot
Aargh
'm fine
Let's get the fuck out of -- ' head breaks the surface of the molten glass
It is white-hot - translucent -- covered with -- It looks like
Hook-like hands grasp the edge of the tank -- It tries to climb out -- Ripley turns to run
Tender ankle gives out
She falls face down on the floor -- Rolls over -- is going to climb out of the vat -- She  -- Grabs the Flying Fox handle
down the rope - across the room -- the Alien -- It turns away from Ripley - She scrambles across the floor
John lands
Points -- Ripley - the lever
Ripley looks next to her:  a burning wooden lever
The Alien has one foot out of the glass furnace -- grabs the lever -- Hssssst
Putting out the fire with her hand -- Pulls -- Empties a thousand gallons -- on the Alien
It  in pain -- The Molten Glass instantly  -- The rapid extreme temperature change causes the beast to -THWOOOoooOOM -
into a million pieces
Ripley helps John off the floor
They are battered
Bloody
They look into the vat
The steam clears
The room is littered with Alien Bits
Each piece is encased in glass -- Trapped like a fly in amber
Saw that happen to a bottle once
(panting) Beat
Beat him - ugh -- She grabs her stomach as her knees give out
John gives her an arm for support
We've got to get to the Library -- Don't worry
Ship
Just -- They look up: Mattias looks down through the hole in the floor
- An
Every bookshelf ablaze
The floor dotted with pools of flame
Ripley and John are at the door - held back by the heat -- John tries to enter the room -- Ripley grabs him -- Don't be stupid -- Some of them
've got to save some of them
Mattias
Mattias yelps in response
Threads his way through to them
Ripley spins him to face her
Tears stream down his cheeks
They're lost
You did your best
If you get out, it wasn't in vain
We've got to live
She  him into the hallway -- : -   - Ripley's good foot  down the burning planks that surround the escape ship
John and Mattias stand behind as she climbs through to the ship
John looks around: The   is devastated
The air is filled with smoke
The Abbey is burning
The Library is in flames
John looks down at his medical bag
Torn, bloody, scorched, it still hangs from his shoulders
Inside: The only remaining book
/ Come on in
John and Mattias step through -- #4 - Ripley  on the lights
John lifts Mattias into the hatch
The Library -- told you -- the Earth is still there -- Ripley checks an instrument:  Elapsed travel time
Her brows knit
She  the gauge
Not working
What does that mean
It means  don't know how long  was in hyper sleep
It means the Abbot could've been right -- It means my clock isn't working
We have to get out of here
Even if he was right this ship's onboard computer is filled with man's knowledge
Not everything
Some things will be lost forever
Then man starts over
He's done it before
She pushes a few buttons
Somewhere under the floor a propulsion source  to life
through the soles of John's feet
Ripley is absorbed in her work
Okay
The seals weren't broken so we're probably clear
But those dead monks out there are going to start hatching soon
Let's get ready to take off
What can  do
Here,  need a compressor tank from in that compartment
She motions towards an open door
John enters the compartment
Whoosh- -
The door closes behind him
Hey
What
He looks out the window in the door
Ripley is staring at him, punching keys on a pad next to the door
Hey - 'm locked in
Mattias scratches at the door
know
locked you in
What
'm not going with you
've got one inside me
What
You can't -- She runs a hand across her midsection
figured it out
That's why it didn't kill me
He must have impregnated me when  was in the stasis tube
(remembers nightmare) It hasn't come out yet because haven't eaten, It's still dormant
So either  eat and it kills me or  don't eat and  starve to death
Either way die
John pulls the Medieval Tome out of his medical bag
My book --  know what to do -- What, an exorcism
No good
You can't do this
Ripley - listen to me - you're confusing feeling of guilt for actual sin -  can help you -- (ignoring) 've set a time lock
When the pod escapes the Colony's gravitational pull this compartment will open
Then all you have to do is get into the Stasis tube with Mattias and press the blue button
With any luck a freighter or something will pick you up
Good luck
He pounds his fists against the door
No, Goddammit - you can't do this
You can't let it win
She turns away from the door
It always wins
We killed it, but it's still inside me -- You're my last chance
If  can keep you alive it'll make up for all those 've lost
Listen to me
You have to let me try
Ripley:  You're  only chance
She's listening
told you Father Anselm raised me
He raised me and when he was dying couldn't do anything to save him didn't know enough
It was my fault he died
If you don't let me try to save you my body will live but my soul will be dead
Ripley turns and stares at him
Please
: Monk vomits up the devil
Pull back as John lowers Ripley to the pod floor
John closes his eyes
Closes the book
He pours some water into a small plastic cup
Retrieves a small pouch of herbs
Opens it
Wrinkles his nose - they smell -- pours these ancient medicines into the space age cup
What is this stuff
(forceful) Something that will make you well
Something that will make you sick
don't -- Shut up and drink
He lifts the back of Ripley's head -- the drink down her throat
John swings his leg over her midsection
her
Presses his two hands together in prayer
Then balls them into one fist
Takes a deep, preparatory breath
Ripley starts to  -- Cough
Her body starts to  -- John        -- -
Ripley  -- has the dry heaves -- --
John  Ripley's diaphragm
She sputters --  a thick mucous-like substance -- -- Ripley's back arches -- She  a gut wrenching  -- Her torso  as the creature is forced upwards
John  down -- Pushes  under her ribs -- the chest-burster up her throat -- Ripley fights for air as the alien  halfway up her esophagus -- She's choking -- John crosses himself -- takes a deep breath -- Lowers his mouth to hers -- Inhales
Exhales
out of Ripley's mouth -- '
Reptilian tail whips about before disappearing down his gullet
John falls back against a computer console
Gagging
Fights to speak
Ripley raises herself up on one elbow
Alien mucous drooling down her chin
Hair matted against her forehead
Why
Choking
It was the only way
He drops the open book in front of her: She sees the etching
Gulps back the oozing slime
Struggles to his feet
They knew
But you -- Ripley tries to stand - to go after him -- She can't sit up -- feels like a rib might be cracked
You'll die -- John stumbles to the Pod door
Turns back
That's idea
Join
my brothers
If we were right, Heaven
If we were wrong -- either way, where we belong
World of books
Pages
He draws the parchment out of his bag
Drops it to the floor
You
are from the real world
He starts to step through the door -- Mattias tries to follow
Stay -- both of you
He exits the Pod
Ripley drags herself across the floor
No - wait
John
To the Door
Looks out: Dawn's rays are peeking through the battered ceiling as he walks slowly across the smoking roof
Into the inferno that is the burning Abbey
Ripley watches as John and the alien horror inside him are The heat of the flames grows
She must pull back -- Reaches up for the door handle
It closes with a
She rolls onto her back
She weeps
For the first time in years
She's been absolved
CREeeek -
The escape pod
Ripley's eyes  open -- The Roof beneath the Pod is beginning to
Ripley rolls onto her stomach and drags herself to the pilot's chair
Pulls herself into the seat
Straps herself in -- #4 Blasts  the wooden outershell of the Orbiter Arceon
towards us - past us
#4 = Ripley places Mattias into the Hyper sleep tube
Rubs under his chin
Is about to climb in with him when she spots something on the floor -- ' Ripley picks it up and unrolls it
She hears John's voice: , Brother John Goldman of the orbiter Arceon, Minorite abbey and gaol, know the Abbot was wrong
There is a great evil here
have seen it
put pen to paper now lest this plague - this creature stills my hand
have gone down below - both to try to warn the others and get the woman - Ripley - get from her some clue as to how to battle this evil, or at least to make my peace for not defending her
She believes there is still and Earth and  hope she is right
hope she will be able to find out
hope she can find some rest for the devils that torment her
Ripley looks at the elapsed time counter on the command console
Pulls a pen from it's holder
She adds: Whether the Earth exists or not, whether we end up in Heaven, or Hell, or the cold vacuum of space, she has
She sets her course
Gets back into her tube
Closes the lid
The escape pod moves through the jet-black void
Dwindles into the darkness behind her, a smouldering, slowly dying ember
Teenager in the back of the movie theater shouts, "It's in the dog
