href <b>// --> </b> " " by Stephen King " " by Stephen King that most persistent summer : crickets in high grass-- ree-ree-ree-ree
This in dark which slowly : It's a plywood cross leaning aslant
Written on the crossarm in black paint which has faded:
The letters are faded
They are also straggling and ill-formed--the work of a child
child's printing again, this time on a chunk of warped crating: 1971-1974
think all these shots are
All is silence but for the crickets and the wind stirring the grass
Around the markers themselves, the grass has been clipped short, and by some markers there are flowers in cheap vases
Crisco cans, Skippy peanut butter jars, etc
These two markers:          1, 1965 (on a wide flat board) and   (
) 1958 (another board)
We can't read all of them; some are too faded (or the "gravestones" themselves too degenerated), but we can see now that this woodland clearing's a rather eerie -- and well-populated -- animal graveyard
We can see: , 1953 and ' tombstone is part of an old Chevrolet hood, painstakingly hammered flat
From here we can see most of the clearing, which is surrounded by forest pines
We can see that the graves--maybe 80 in all--are arranged in rough concentric circles
On the far side of this clearing is the end of a path which spills into this graveyard clearing
The end of the path is flanked by wooden poles which hold up a crude arch
We can see no writing on this side -- the words on the arch face those arriving along the path
,    , Written on the arch in faded black paint is the work of some long-gone child:
, to look through the arch
From this angle we are looking across to a deadfall--a tangle of weather-whitened old dead branches at the back of the graveyard
It's maybe twenty-five feet from side to side and about nine feet high
At either end are thick tangles of underbrush that look impassible
,      on the deadfall
And as it does, we realize that there is a horrible snarling face in those branches
Is this an accident
Coincidence
Our imagination
Perhaps the audience will wonder and then we : And a white title card:
of crickets: ree-ree-ree-ree
To the left of this house: a big empty field
Behind it: the woods
Before it: a wide two-lane road
The house is a pleasant two-story New England dwelling with a shed/garage attached
In front of it is a sign which reads 292  ,
big  strip, like a bumper sticker, has been plastered across it diagonally
: the rumble of a truck
big, big truck
It belts between the  and the house -- a tanker truck with a silver body and the word  written on the side in blue letters
Its short-stack is blowing quantities of dark brown smoke
Behind it comes a Ford wagon, which slows, signals, and turns into the driveway of the house we've been looking at
As   brings it to a stop we get a good look at the license plate (Illinois) and a bumper sticker ( ) The   stops
For a moment or two we hear only the ree- ree-ree-ree of crickets
Then: (voice) Is this our new house, daddy
(voice) This is it
, The two front doors and one back door open
, about 32, gets out from the driver's side
, his wife, gets out from the passenger side
From the rear door comes  , a girl of 6
They are staring, fascinated, at the house
They come together, the three of them, by the front of the wagon, still staring at the house
is clearly nervous
So
what do you think
begins to smile
She turns to  and hugs him
It's gorgeous
Am  really gonna have my own room
Yes
Yaay
She looks toward the side lawn and sees a tire on a rope hanging down from the bough of a tree
(to ) Is that a swing
Yes, but the rope might be-- Yaay
She goes running toward it
gives  a tired smile
Let her go
It's cool
Louis, the house is beautiful
They kiss--gently at first, then more passionately
As he draws her more tightly against him, a baby----begins to cry from the car
and  break the clinch
The Master of Disaster awakes
This  is joined by the unhappy yowling of a pent-up tomcat
And Buckaroo Banzai
Come on--let's parole 'em
They walk to the car,  going to one of the back seat doors, to the rear of the wagon
, is sitting in his car seat, not exactly crying but certainly yelling to be let out
The seat, dash, and floorboards are littered with roadmaps, soda cans, Big Mac boxes, and similar crud
These folks have driven all the way from Chicago to Maine in this station wagon, and the wagon looks it
Decided to wake up and see what home looks like, huh
She begins to unbuckle the straps and harnesses
is just wearing a t-shirt and a diaper
He's fifteen months old
, He opens the doorgate and lifts out a cat carrier
We see a big tomcat inside--mostly what we're aware of are shining green eyes
(voice) Daddy
Mommy
see a path
, cat carrier still in hand, turns toward: She's got it penduluming back and forth in long wide arcs
, ' We see the field, and a clearly marked and mown path leading up its flank and into the dark woods
as  swings
(   ) (irritated) Not so high, Ellie
You don't know how strong that rope is
She puts  down
He totters a bit on his little legs and then stands there, looking at his sister
, The bark has rubbed off the branch--it looks like a bone peeping through decayed flesh
The rope is old, discolored
And it is fraying away as we look at it
Soon , like Humpty Dumpty, is going to have a great fall
(   ) He's set the cat-carrier down and is straightening up
(raptuous voice) Wheee
Ellie, you heard your m--- His eyes widen
Wh-- :  heavy twang
as the rope breaks
The tire swing--with still inside it--goes crashing to the grass
screams and begins to cry--a little hurt and a lot surprised
and  run to her
Ellie
Are you all right
Honey
Are you okay
, , , ' parents reach the tangle of tire, rope, and six-year-old girl
Hurrts
It hurrrrts
Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee
Nevertheless, he begins to rapidly disentangle his daughter from the tire
helps
He's standing in the driveway by the front of the car, utterly forgotten in the heat of the moment
His diaper is sagging quite a bit; the boy needs a change
He stares toward the scene of the accident for a bit, then loses interest
as he walks down the side of the station wagon, little bare feet slapping on the asphalt
He stops for a moment at the back, looking at the cat-carrier, which  never got around to opening
is staring hopefully out through the mesh
Hi-Durch
Waow
bends down and tries to open the cat-carrier's door
No soap
Either he can't solve the latch or his fingers don't have the strength
Anyway, he stops trying after a moment
: Growing thunder of an approaching truck - a big one
(' ) big tanker truck--silver body,  written on the side in blue letters--blasts by
, The windlash if the passing truck blows ' hair back from his forehead
We should be scared here--not by the truck, but by ' lack of fear
He's smiling, happy
Druck
He starts down the driveway toward the road
, ,  (  ) has been disentangled from the swing
She's sitting by the wreckage at the end of the driveway, weeping hysterically (as much from tiredness as from pain,  think) as  and  examine her scraped knee
The wound doesn't look too serious
(to ) Would you get the first aid kit
(screaming) Not the stingy stuff
don't want the stingy stuff, daddy
suddenly looks around toward: (' ) No one there
, , , Gage's gone
Jesus, the road
They get up together
, truck is coming
great big one
, The grille looks like a tombstone that's learned how to snarl
He takes a step into the road
and then big, gnarled hands grab him
looks rather surprised at this, but not worried--this kid is used to being picked up and treated humanely
To  strangers are as interesting as
well, as interesting as Orinco trucks
The fellow who has picked  up is a man of about eighty in old blue jeans, a faded Bruce Springsteen t-shirt
Over this he wears a faded khaki vest with bright silver buttons
His face is deeply wrinkled and kindly
(to ) No you don't, my friend--not in that road
But he softens this with a grin
grins back at him
Drucks
(low) No shit, Sherlock
carries him up the driveway to the station wagon
Here he's joined by  and , out of breath and really scared brings up the rear
She's still sniffling
Gage
(hands him to her) He was headed for the road, looked like
corralled him for you, missus
Thank you
Thank you so much
Yes--thanks
'm Louis Creed
He sticks out his hand and  shakes it
takes it easy--no crushing JayCees grip, or anything like that--the old guy looks as if he might have arthritis
Jud Crandall
live just across the road
'm Rachel
Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here
No harm, no foul
But you want to watch out for that road
Those damn trucks go back and forth all day and most of the night
He leans over toward
Who might you be, little Miss
'm Ellen Creed and  live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan
(Pause) At least,  used to
And now you live on Route 9 in Ludlow, and your dad's gonna be the new doctor up to the college,  hear, and  think you're going to be just as happy as a clam here, Ellen Creed
(to ) Are clams really happy
They all laugh--even
Excuse me, Mr
Crandall--'ve got to change this kid
It's nice to meet you
Same here
Come over and visit when you get the chance
As , carrying , moves away: (worries) Daddy, do  really have to have the stingy stuff
No- guess not
Yayyy
She goes belting off
(amused) guess your daughter there ain't going to die after all
(also amused) guess not
House has stood empty for too long
It's damn good to see people in it again
:  truck engine, gearing down
It blinks and comes lumbering into the Creed's driveway
Hey--they actually found the place
Movin' in's mighty thirsty work usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner
Come on over and join me, if you want
Well, maybe ---- (voice) Louis, what's this
has been changed, and  is following him as he explores the nearest edges of the new homestead
They are fairly close to the wreckage of the tire swing, and here is the head of the path has already glimpsed
They cross to the van
The  and   are just climbing out of the van
You Mr
Creed
Yes
Just a second
, She's holding  on her hip now, and both of them are looking at that strange (and oddly enticing) path which disappears into the deepening twilight
and  join them
The movers-- Yes-- know
This path, Louis
Where does it go
don't have the slightest idea
When  saw the house, this field was under four feet of snow
(smiling) bet Mr
Crandall knows
nods
He smiles, too, but underneath the smile we sense that he is serious
Oh, ayuh
know
It's a good story, and a good walk, too
'll take you up there sometime, and tell you the story, too-- after you get settled in
He smiles at them and they smile back--it is a look of understanding and real liking, in spite of the age difference between the  and
: Crickets
Ree--ree--ree-ree
There's one light upstairs, one downstairs
Perhaps we see the path, glimmering away into the field
Either by virtue of it being mown, or by virtue of some gentle optical trick
Maybe
There's a light on in the kitchen, but it just casts a dim glow in here
The room has a fireplace and a lovely wooden floor
It's going to be nice, but now it's just a big bare box with movers' cartons stacked all over the place
is drinking a can of Pepsi, and he looks pretty damned tired--anyone who's ever moved house and can remember the first night in the new place will understand
He finishes the last of the Pepsi and surveys the living room
He sits on one of the bigger boxes, takes cigarettes from his pocket, and lights one
He drops the spent match in the empty can, and taps into the can during the scene
: Feet coming down the stairs
The door on the far side of the room opens and  comes in, wearing a nightgown
(crossing to ) Kids are asleep, doc
Great
He hugs her
She hugs him back warmly--for a moment they are just two good people in all the big darkness of their new house
You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you
Well, 've got a million questions about the area, and--- ---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and--- Did you see his shirt
(giggles) Sure
Bruce Springsteen
really do have a million questions about the area
but the thing 'm really curious about is how come this octogenarian Yankee is decorating the slumped remains of his pecs with the Boss
She laughs
Pervasive  of the crickets as  comes rather hesitantly up the crazy-paved path from the road's edge
(voice) That you, doc
- We hear the  of a rocker; we see the dim red fitful glow of ' Pall Mall
We see by its glow that he is wearing Walkman earphones
It's me
, The Walkman is in his lap
He switches it off and puts the headphones casually around his neck, like a kid
Well, come on up and have a beer
, comes on up
has got a pail of ice beside his chair with some cans of beer in it
He opens one and hands it to
You need a glass
Not at all
Good for you
drinks half the can at a draught
God, that's fine
Ain't it just
The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself
What were you listening to
Allman Brothers
What
The Eat  Peach album
God, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them
Listen to this, Louis
He passes the headphones over
puts them on
presses the Walkman's  button
: Ramblin' Man blasts us out of our seats
winces and rakes the spidery earphones off his head
'm sorry
Wait
He turns it down
Try that
puts the earphones back on and listens for a few moments
It's the instrumental break
Gregg and Duane Allman dueling hot Fenders
takes the earphones off
Nice
like rock and roll
No
guess that's too mild
love it
Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music  can really hear
And since my wife died
dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night
Not always, but sometimes
(Pause) One more time--welcome to Ludlow
Hope your time here will be a happy one
(great sincerity) Thank you, Mr
Crandall
He drinks again--they both do
There's a moment of companionable silence here, broken by the  of a big truck
They look toward: /
(   ) One of those big tanker trucks goes rumbling by--now there are little amber running lights on top of it
It's going fast, too-- sweeps by in a blast of air
, (wincing) Jesus
(lights a cigarette) That's one mean road, all right--you remember that path your wife commented on
The one that goes into the woods--sure
That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there
What's at the end of it
(smiles) Another day--after you get settled in a bit
Meantime, doc--- Here  raises his glass in a toast
(continues) Here's to your bones
clinks his glass against '
And yours
They drink
9 crosses from the  side to his own, and the as he walks slowly up the driveway and past the wagon
He pauses for a moment, looking thoughtfully--hopefully--at his new house
Then something--the  of an , perhaps--draws his attention the other way
toward the path
He walks to its head and stands looking out at it--it glimmers in a wide cut swath that's a bit ghostly in the dark
suddenly lurches out of the high grass at him, and recoils with a startled, muffled cry
The cat, sure; who--or what--else
We see his big green eyes in the dark as he cries his strange feline hello: Waow
, Church
God, you scared the life out of me
Waow
bends and picks up the cat
As he does, that truck comes again and he looks toward: , ' Another Orinco tanker drones by, fast
(to the cat) know one thing that will keep you home, good buddy
He starts toward the house
And in that blackness, we see a second title card: , Written on it is:  1
)   10 ,
And below, in even bigger letters: 2
) ' , showing us the kitchen
There are still a few cardboard cartons around, but the place is getting in shape
We look out the window and see the , led by  , climbing the path toward the woods
has got  in a Gerrypak
, They are also at the edge of the woods
stops and lets them catch up
Take a look behind you
They turn around, and their faces express their wonder
My God
It's beautiful
It is indeed beautiful
The  house is in the f
g
, Route 9 just behind it (with one of the ever-present Orinco trucks droning along), but behind that is the great sweep of the Penobscot river valley, dozing under a fall sky of clear blue
, You folks ready to go on
Sure
But where are we going, Mr
Crandall
You'll see soon enough, hon
They go into the woods, still following the path
These are old woods indeed--huge trunks with dusty sunlight shafting through them
It looks as though man has never made his mark here
to them, on the path
Here it is carpeted with pine needles, but it is just as clearly marked
stops
looks glad of the rest; he's sweating and there are wide dark patches under his arms where the Gerrypak's straps are
Who owns the woods up ahead
Paper companies
Nope
The Micmac Indians
What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands
(giggling) Micmac, Ricmac, Kickmac, Sickmac
(smiles) Ayuh, it's a funny word, ain't it
You tired of totin' that yowwen yet, doc
Not yet
how much further is it
Aw, you'll be okay
Less than a mile
He starts off again, fresh as a daisy
scampers after him
rolls his eyes at his wife and  rolls hers back
Then they press on
, (stopping) This is the place, honey
is of course second
Se tries to read the words on the arch but can't
She whips around to look at her mother
What's it say, mommy
strange expression has come over ' face--she doesn't like this
Not a bit
It says Pet Cemetery, hon
It's misspelled, but
that's what it says
She runs for the arch
starts; looks more uneasy than ever
Ellen--
She's almost under the arch
She looks back, questioning
, , (a bit lame) Be careful
She goes racing into the Pet Sematary
, , lights a cigarette with a wooden match, using his thumbnail
told you it was a bad road, Louis--it's killed a lot of pets and made a lot of kids unhappy
But at least something good come of it
This place
(excited voice) Mom
Dad
'oughtta see it
, She surveys the rude markers with puzzled delight, then runs toward the center, pausing to investigate some of the markers as she goes
We clearly see the symmetrical pattern of rings
, , They are walking slowly toward that rude archway
is extremely interested in all this, but it's becoming clearer and clearer that  is troubled
They stop and look in
How can you call it a good thing
graveyard for pets killed in the road
Built and maintained by broken- hearted children
Well, but Missus Creed
It ain't quite that way, deah
think it's rather extraordinary
Extraordinarily morbid, maybe
She's growing more and more upset
looks at her curiously
Well
they have to learn about death somehow, now don't they, Missus Creed
The little ones
(coldly) Why
Well
well, because-- (voice) Mommy
Daddy
Look at me
, She has begun to climb it, and this looks like an extremely dangerous proposition
, however, is having the time of her life
branch breaks under one of her feet and she switches nimbly to the next one up
, (alarmed) No, honey
You don't want to go climbing on that
Come on down
He hurries in
, She looks back at
It's okay, Mr
Crandall-- ' , The branch she's on breaks with a dry
Her foot drops down suddenly
She totters backward, pinwheeling her arms, and  catches her as she falls
Not much of a catch because she wasn't too far up
joins  and
jounces along on his back
Have you got a death-wish, Ellen
Well,  thought it was safe-- Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite
Bite
Ayuh
, Her discomfort makes one thing very clear--she doesn't want to come in
(calls) Is she all right, Louis
, , (calls back) Fine
Come and see
, (calling) think 'll sit this one out, doc
, , -- want to look around, daddy-- may
For a little while
looks toward: (
) has retreated a bit
She sits on the pine needle carpet of the path, opens her purse, and draws out cigarettes
looks at  as if to say "What's all this about
" looks away
(voice) Dad
Daddy
Look
goldfishie
She runs from one tombstone to the next, cheerful as maybe only a kid could be in such a place
She looks at ' tombstone; at '
They are walking slowly toward her
is looking at the tombstones
can hardly read these
Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle
(Points) Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there
(points) the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got
and  think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years  can't tell for sure
(calling) Missy Ellen
Come over here just a minute
She runs amid the tombstones--they have worked their way near to the center and there are quite a few of them--and joins the adults
see you're quite a reader for such a little girl
Can you read that
He points again, and Ellen goes over for a look-see
, It is a small slate marker slanted to one side
reads the words laboriously, tracing them with her finger
"Spot a good fellow we love you boy
" (Pause) "Owned by Judson
Judson
" Gee,  can't read the rest
Last name's Crandall, little missy
looks at him sharply as  rejoins them
That's where  buried my dog Spot when he died of old age in 19 and 14
Dug it good and deep
By the time  finished,  had blisters all over my hands and a hell of a crick in my back
Soil's stony up here
looks awed
looks a little awed, too
sweeps a hand around, indicating the whole sematary, but is still looking at
Do you know what this place is, Ellie
Oh,  know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much
Do you know what a graveyard really is
Well
guess not
It's a place where the dead speak, Missy
He sees her startled, uneasy expression and laughs
He ruffles her hair reassuringly
No--not right out loud
Their stones speak
or their markers
Even if the marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks
Ain't that so, Louis
think it is so, Ellie
What if you can't read what's written on there anymore
Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it
Yes-- And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot
To remember
(smiles) Yes
To remember
This ain't a scary place, Ellie
It's a place of rest and speaking
Can you remember that
(a little awed) Yes, sir
They start to walk slowly back toward the arch
, It's clear she's impatient and out-of-sorts with the whole thing
(calls) Louis, can we go
'm tired
, , Mommy
This is a place where dead animals talk
Mr
Crandall said so
But  is not amused
She doesn't like any of this
(soft) Did he
My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind
As you may have noticed
Me neither
But  believe in knowing your enemy
looks at him, startled, then decides this is a joke
He laughs
smiles, a trifle thinly
, The men rejoin  and
(voice) Did we take too long
(curt) Well, if supper's burned, 'm not the one going out for pizza
They move away
, The face we saw at the beginning of the movie wasn't there when the visitors were there
but it's sure there now, leering at us
There are two greasy boxes poking out with   stamped on them
Guess dinner was burned
and we se  sitting at the kitchen table
The table is covered with newspapers
On it,  is putting together a complicated model boat, using glue and tweezers
He's wearing glasses
comes in, wearing a nightgown
She watches him for awhile
(not looking around) Hi, babe
Daddy, that Pet Sematary is there because of the road, isn't it
looks around at her, surprised
That's what  think
heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much
Well, it's always better to take precautions--but 'm sure Church will be all right, honey
is coming along with some dirty dishes
She hears voices and stops, listening, her face troubled and afraid
(voice) No he won't
Not in the end
He won't be all right in the end no matter how you fix 'im
Ellis has started to cry
In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he
Lovey
Church might be still alive when you're in a high school
and that's a very long time
It doesn't seem long to me
It seems short
think the whole thing about pets dying s-s-sucks
Poor kid's bawling her eyes out now
folds her into his arms and she hugs him tightly, wanting his comfort
If it was up to me 'd let Church live to be a hundred
but  don't make up the rules
(muffled) Well who does
God,  suppose
But he's not God's cat
He's my cat
Let God get His own, if He wants one
Not mine
Not mine
Not-- She breaks down completely, sobbing, and  rocks her back and forth
, She is crying silently
' She is a dimly perceived hump in the darkness
An oblong shaft of light falls on her, illuminating her more clearly
She's asleep with her teddy encircled by one arm and her thumb corked into her mouth
, looks at her daughter with infinite love and then quietly closes the door
'  ' is in his pajamas, propped up on pillows on his side of the bed
There a number of medical books scattered around him and he's making notes from one as  comes in
She's finally asleep
She was a little over-excited, that's all
Poor kid
It was that place
That creepy cemetery up in the woods
Whatever disease the kids in this town have got,  don't want Ellie to catch it
Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you
Do you think  didn't hear her tonight, crying as if her heart would break
Here she is thinking Church is going to die
It should be clear to us by now that, despite her words,  is much more upset than  was
slowly puts his notebook aside and caps his pen
Rachel
someday Church is going to die
(whirls on him) That is hardly the point
Church is not going to die today, or tomorrow-- Never mind
can see you don't have the slightest idea what 'm talking about
She stalks to the bathroom, which adjoins
follows
She goes in and slams the door
He goes for the knob
Rachel--
:
stares at the door, bewildered and upset
9 Here comes a big Orinco truck, droning along, headlights glaring
'  ' The headlights of the truck illuminate the room and we see and  asleep, each as far over to his/her own side as he/she can get, with a big empty space in the middle
Lights and   slowly fade
Cheerful little clots of scrambled eggs are scattered all the way across the tray of his high-chair--it looks a little like a map of the Pacific islands done by a guy who only had a yellow crayon
Now he scoops up a handful and throws them
, Splat
Eggs on the serving plate of toast
Yee-uck
Gross
, is at the sink, doing dishes (we see the blackboard with its message near her)
comes in, wearing a sport-coat and slacks, ready for his first day on the job
and  is in a pretty first day of school dress
He can't help it, babe
Emily Post is going to be beyond him for a few years
Here is the cat-carrier with  inside it
He waows unhappily
, gets down and goes across to the cat-carrier
don't want him to get his nuts cut, daddy
What if he dies
, looks shocked and amused by ' colorful choice of words
Good God
Where'd you hear that
Missy Dandridge
And she says it's a operation
, tries to kiss ' mouth
She turns her head slightly so he gets her cheek instead
She's still mad
' amusement dies
Honey, Church will be fine
, But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary
, She gives him a look as if to say: "There
Now do you understand what you did
" Don't be silly
Church is not going to die
According to what Mr
Crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation
Church will be just the same
Well--almost the same--and we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks
At this  tightens up still more in that funny way--she's actually angered by ' reference to catburgers--but under the anger we sense she is deeply shocked, as a prudish woman might be shocked by a dirty joke
For , that's just what death is
That's enough of that kind of talk
just said-- know what you just said
Ellie, clear your place
goes slowly back to the table
(sets the plate down) 'm scared
What if school here isn't like in Chicago
'm scared and  want to go h-h-home
bursts into loud tears and puts her hands over her face
,    (   ) as they go to the table to comfort
You'll be fine, Ellie
Now you can be excused
Go and wash your face
And Church will be fine
(anxious) Do you promise, Daddy
Well, honey
you know that
Don't shilly-shally, Louis
Give the little girl her promise
(reluctantly) Church will be fine
promise
Yayyyy
She runs off, cheered up
And  is cheered up, too
Thank you, Louis
Oh, you're welcome
Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her
He gets up and leaves the table
She looks after him, stunned and a little frightened
(conversationally) Here, Durch
He picks up a large glob of scrambled eggs from his tray and throws it in the direction of the cat-carrier
- is close to the mesh, looking out
Scrambled eggs hit the mesh, driving him back, surprised
The school bus pulls up, red lights flashing

Bye-bye
climbs aboard
The red flashers go out and the bus pulls away
The station wagon is parked there
comes out with a heavy briefcase in one hand and the cat-carrier in the other
He opens the wagon's doorgate

rather sour-looking middle-aged woman gets out and crosses the front of her car
Her color is bad
This is
She looks at the cat-carrier
Gonna get his-- --nuts cut, yes
Thank you, Missy, for introducing that colorful phrase into my daughter's vocabulary
Don't mention it
She opens the passenger side door of her car and we see a big neat pile of folded sheets
She reaches for them, then winces and presses her hands against her midriff for a moment, as if with an attack of indigestion
(sees this) How's that belly-ache of yours
(gets the sheets) No better and no worse
You ought to see a doctor about it
It'll pass
They always do
She starts toward the house with the sheets
hurries past , who turns to look and then goes on into the house
has just put the cat-carrier into the back of the wagon and closed the doorgate as  reaches him
(anxious) Still friends, doc
appears to consider this seriously for a moment
and then he smiles and hugs her
They kiss
Thank God
was a little worried there
Have a great first day at school, doc
No broken bones

They are all yelling at each other not to joggle him, not to drop him
small knot of horrified college kids moves with the bearers

Fixed eyes stare
Half of his head has been shattered inward
Before the catastrophe he was a husky male of about twenty
He's dressed in a  of  muscle shirt and red jogging shorts

The lookers-on break to either side
The infirmary doors open

Blood leaks from ' mouth

At first he can only gurgle
It's not the real cemetery
(Long pause) The soil of a man's heart is stonier, Louis

How do you know my name

He closes the eyes
, It's the leading edge of Maine fall, sunny and wonderful
Here comes ' station wagon
As it reaches  , it swivels to
(voice-over) Tragedy struck on the first day of the University of Maine's fall semester when Victor Pascow, a nineteen-year-old sophomore-- , He still looks shocked by the tragedy
The dying man's bloody handprint is partly visible on ' shirt in spite of his sport-coat
abruptly turns off the radio and swerves over to the side of the road
comes to a slueing, shuddering stop, almost going in the ditch
, He said my name
heard it
He said my name
He stares blankly through the windshield
All lights are off
It's late
and  are asleep, each on his/her own side of the big double
: Loud, hollow
It's very loud--loud enough to wake the dead
sits up
Beside him,  sleeps on
' eyes widen in terror as he stares at: , He's exquisitely dead
Now pallid as well as smashed up
Come on, doc
We got places to go
He is in terror
but he is also in a state of near-trance
Come on, doc--don't make me tell you twice
He glances at
Although  has spoken in a fairly loud voice--and the opening door was like a bomb--she's still fast asleep
looks back toward
and then gets out of bed
He's naked except for a pair of pajama bottoms
He turns and leaves the doorway
He reaches the bedroom doorway himself and looks back at: , ' is sleeping as before, and  himself is also in bed asleep, although his rest is uneasy
as if he's having a bad dream
, (relieved) Oh
Thank God
(Voice) Hurry up, doc
enters and crosses toward the door which gives on the shed/garage
This door stands open
pauses by it
(low) Come on, doc
goes into: / The station wagon is a dark hulk
crosses to it and stands, perplexed
looms softly behind him and puts an arm around him turns
and suddenly his face is less than an inch from ' mutilated face
Let's go, doc
(moans) don't like this dream
Who said you were dreaming
He begins to move toward the garage door
After a moment follows him
, We can see two shapes moving up the path toward the woods-- and, behind him,
,    as  passes under the arch
, He looks around, obviously afraid
, ' We can see why
By starlight this is one scary place
He suddenly sees something else, and now his fear is close to terror
, ' The face is back in the tumbled branches
It yawns and snarls
He walks toward the deadfall as if hypnotized
' hand falls on his shoulder
turns, terrified
, He really is a dreadful mangled mess
This is the place where the dead speak
He closes his eyes
want to wake up
want to wake up, that's all
-- The door must not be opened
The barrier must not be crossed
Don't go on, doc
No matter how much you feel you have to
There's more power here than you know
He points at: That grinning face--and perhaps now there are other effects as well, subtle but there
Dim red light
misty smoke drifting through the tumbled dead branches
The director will know
After a moment there is a    from the woods behind the deadfall--it sounds like no animal we've ever heard before
There is the sound of something huge shifting and snapping a tree like a toothpick
has crumbled to ' feet
His eyes are squeezed tightly shut
Please,  want to wake up
Leave me alone
It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in-- The power of this place is old and always restless
Sometimes the dead do more than speak
Remember, doc
Leave me alone
Remember
(voice) --another beautiful day in Maine
This is Michael 'Hara sayin' that the git-go ain't gonna be that bad
Temps are going all the way up to 70
We got the Ramones for Ludlow
here's "Sheena
" As the Ramones start blasting "Sheena Is  Punk Rocker": , His eyes snap open
He's in his own bedroom
As he sits up so we can see that he's in bed alone; the covers on ' side are thrown back
After the initial confusion and fear,  looks deeply relieved; he looks the way  suppose we all look upon waking up and realizing our worst dreams were only dreams after all
(calls) You up, doc
Getting there
got eggs down here
Good d-- He throws the covers back and freezes
' , ' They are covered with mud and pine needles
The sheets are greased with woods-muck
, Utter terror
, ' hands enter the shot and dump a bundle of sheets into the chute
, He's naked but for a towel around his waist
He's obviously fresh from the shower
He starts down to the bedroom to dress
And on it a third title card:
Over this the  of a
(voice) Hello
There's a bowling match on
, dressed in his Saturday afternoon grubs (jeans and a Maine sweatshirt), has the phone to his ear
(phone filter) Louis
'Fraid you may have a spot of trouble
(frowning) Jud
What trouble
, He's on the phone, looking out his window
Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days
, For Ellie's birthday, yes
didn't go because her old man thinks 'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated
they'll be back tomorrow night
Jud, what's this about
, Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis
think it might be your daughter's
, Church
Oh
Oh, Jesus
, - We're looking across from the  lawn
waits for one of those trucks to go blasting by and then crosses
It's cold and windy
Downed autumn leaves fly
and  stand over a small furry body like mourners
(voice) Well
' It's lying on its belly and doesn't look much damaged
Hands-- '--come into the frame
He puts one hand under the cat's head and lifts it so the open eyes, now a dull green, stare into There's some blood on its ruff
That's all
, It's Church
'm sorry
At least it don't look like he suffered
Ellie will, though
She'll suffer plenty
From his jacket pocket he takes a green plastic garbage bag and hands it to
holds the bag's mouth open on the ground while  kind of shoves the body in
During this: Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she
Yes
twists the bag shut and puts one of those plastic ties on it
Then he holds it up
Bagged cat
What a mess
You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary
(a little bitter) guess that's what it's there for, huh
During all of this  has grown peculiarly intense
Going to tell Ellie
don't know
Seems like you told me about a promise you made-- is in his high chair
, in her first-day-of-school dress, is in her place
is sitting at his own place staring, hypnotized, at the middle of the table, where there is a large serving dish
On the dish is scrambled eggs, strips of bacon, and ' corpse--staring eyes, bloody ruff and all
(impatiently) Don't shilly-shally, Louis
Give the little girl her promise
, (defensive) That was a mistake
But Rachel
she doesn't like to talk about death, or even think of it
Her younger sister died of spinal meningitis when Rachel was eight
Rachel was there when it happened
Alone
guess you could say it made a complex
Cat's just as dead, Louis
(snaps) Well that's a big help
(Pause) 'm sorry, Jud
No need to apologize
Maybe when they call 'll just tell Ellie  haven't seen the damn cat around
You know
(after a long pause) Maybe there's a better way
, and  cross the road from the  side
is carrying the plastic bag in one hand and a flashlight in the other
has a pick and shovel in one hand and a flashlight of his own in the other
Evening shadows have grown long
It's maybe an hour until dark
and  stop near the replaced tire-swing
has a Walkman clipped to the belt of his pants and earphones slung around his neck
Jud, this is crazy
It's going to be almost dark before we get back
It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis
But we can do it
and we're going to
But-- Does she love the cat
Yes, but-- Then come on
He puts the earphones on, effectively forestalling further argument, and pushes the  button on the Walkman
We can hear Marshall Crenshaw singing "Crystal Girl
"  starts away
After a moment,  follows
The  of crickets
ree-ree-ree
The  of footfalls
Faintly, the  of Huey Lewis and the News, singing "Working For  Living
" It's now almost twilight
and  enter the Pet Sematary
is looking around curiously
Well, folks, here we are, in Louis Creed Dreamland
snaps off the Walkman and puts the earphones around his neck again
What say, Louis
Nothing
(Pause) Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one
We're still not where we're going
He walks past  and toward the deadfall
follows
What do you mean
The place we're going is on the other side of that
He points at the deadfall
We can't climb over that
We'll break our necks
No
We won't
have climbed it a time or two before, and  know all the places to step
Just follow me
move easy
don't look down
and don't stop
If you stop, you'll crash through for sure
'm not climbing that
Give me the cat
'll take care of it myself
He holds out his hand and  sees the old man means exactly as he says
After a moment he says: Let's go
starts up one side of the deadfall, and in spite of its snarled tangles, he mounts as easily as a man climbing a flight of stairs
After a few second,  follows
(low) Thank God my Blue Cross is paid up
First ' pass  , then ', partly obscured by the swinging cat-bag
Their feet unerringly find the right branches and just as unerringly miss holes which look like ankle-breakers
He's grinning, exhilarated
God, this is amazing
There are beads of sweat on the old man's face
He looks both stern and a little scared
Just don't stop and-- He looks down
' dead branch snaps under one of them like a gunshot and that foot plunges down maybe six inches
He lurches to the edge of balance, then regains it
And don't look down
Right
He continues
, reaches the top and starts down the far side
reaches the top
(amazed) Holy
, ' In the dying glow of twilight, this should be a mystic, awe- inspiring shot
There's no more scrub underbrush and junk pines and juniper-bracken here; ancient firs rise almost like Sequoias
The sunset light shafts among them
This is a real forest
an old forest
And winding upward among the trees along that needle- carpeted floor, clearly marked by large white stones, the path goes on
He's stopped on top of the deadfall, still surveying all this with frank amazement
(turns to look) Come on, Louis--don't stop
, (grinning) 'm all right
'm f-- ' One of the branches snaps
' foot plunges
His cuff rips
, ' We're looking up at a fairly steep angle as  staggers off- balance
He steps with his other foot, misses, and goes flying
, He does a half-somersault in the air and hits the deadfall on his back, the green garbage bag flying out of his hand
His flashlight also goes
Branches crack
White dust puffs out from under him
, thumps to the ground nearby
kneels beside him
Louis
You all right
sits up groggily
His pants are torn
His sweatshirt is torn
His ankle is bleeding
(dazed) Sure
guess  just lost my happy thoughts for a second there
gets slowly up and retrieves the bag, which is rather shredded now--and we can see catfur through some of the rents
(continues) shouldn't have stopped
and it does bite
He whaps the flashlight against his palm a time or two and the light comes on
Satisfied, he shuts it off
No, you shouldn't have stopped
But you got away with it
Important thing is are you sure you're all right
Yes
(Pause) Where are we going, Jud
You'll see before long
Let's go
He starts off up the path
After a moment  follows, carrying the bag
, Again, there should be a sense of awe and mystery as they go tolling up the path into the twilight, dwarfed by those ancient firs
,  at first, then   : Ree-ree-ree
: , Lots of undergrowth here, and creeping ground-mist, too
The is now only a part of the soundtrack:   , Swamp-sounds
looks frankly doubtful
This next bit's like the deadfall, Louis-- you got to walk steady and easy
Just follow me and don't look down
, '  ' Mysterious
awesome
scary
Dead trees poke out of the murk like twisted hands
There's scummy water standing around tussocks covered with long grass, most of it dead
There's a lot of choking underbrush
All of this fades away into a grim, obscuring fog
Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp
Is there quicksand
Ayuh
(nervous; joking) Are there ghosts
looks at him expressionlessly
Ayuh
starts off, stepping to the first tussock
After a moment, follows
, His face is set, strange
There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis
, You're telling me
(still walking) The air's heavier
more electrical
something
You might see St
Elmo's Fire
what the sailors call 'foo-lights
' It makes funny shapes, but it's nothing
looks up and his eyes widen as he sees: , ' faintly glowing, ethereal shape hangs in the branches of one of the dead trees
It looks a bit like a corpse
In fact,  think it looks quite a bit like ' corpse
As we watch it fades
fades
is gone
He's somewhere between being mystified and puzzled and being scared
Now a weakly glowing fireball rolls slowly across the surface of the standing water toward him
and then just fades into the thick mist
It's funny, all right
Just don't stop, Louis
You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God
(Pause) And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear
, We see them moving through the mist like wraiths,  with his digging tools,  with his light and his Hefty-Bag coffin
The whole swamp is glowing dimly
In the extreme f
g
we can see firm ground sloping up
Ahead is a thick white mist
And here comes  and  slogging through it and out of it
Both of them are wet from the knees down
They head into the woods on the far side
, In the book this is described as being almost a cliff, but a rocky hill rising out of the woods would serve just as well
We can see steps cut into the side, and two figures-- and --toiling up them
, ' panting and out of breath;  is, if anything, in worse shape
Almost there, Louis
You keep saying that
This time  mean it
He tops the last step and stands on a rocky level under the stars, the wind blowing his hair off his deeply lined brow
few moments later  joins him and stares with undisguised wonder
,   ' The top of this hill or bluff is rocky and bare, but there are a number of rocky piles
But for every pile of rocks we can see, there are ten littered heaps, as if the neat piles had been burst apart
There's a shape to all of this, and it is the shape of the Pet Sematary: concentric circles
: The wind, blowing ceaselessly
, (awed) What is this place
This was their burying ground, Louis
Whose burying ground
The Micmac Indians
brought you here to bury Ellen's cat
Why
For God's sake, why
had my reasons, Louis
We'll talk later
All right
guess so
but
You want to rest a bit before you start
No, 'm okay
Will  really be able to dig him a grave
The soil looks thin
Soil's thin, all right
But you'll manage
He hands him the pick and shovel
'm going to sit over yonder and have a smoke
'd help you, but you've got to do it yourself
Each buries his own
That's how it was done then
walks away, leaving  with the digging tools in one hand and the flashlight in the other
After a minute,  walks out into the burying ground
: The wind
It blows ceaselessly up here
The hole's about two and a half feet deep
Stubby rocks protrude from the sides
The pick comes down, hits a rock at the bottom, and flashes fire
He drops the pick and sticks his hurt hands in his armpits
Beside him we see a low pile of rocks and earth
(voice) Should be deep enough
He joins
He's got a lot of rocks in his arms
You think so
He notices the rocks
What are those for
Your cairn
, ' Those tumbled piles of rock are very obvious
,  ' Doesn't look like they last long
Don't worry about that
Jud, why am  doing all this
Because it's right
He walks off again
looks after him for a moment, then kneels down
, He opens it and looks in at ' stiffening corpse
Pax vobiscum, Church old buddy
You were a hell of a god cat
doubt if you were worth all this aggravation, but you were a hell of a good cat
He tumbles the bag containing the body into the grave, and then begins pushing the stony soil over it with the spade
, ' hands come into the frame and add a final two or three stones
, He looks at it for a moment and stands up
is right there
That's fine
You did real good
looks at him
There's a light on in the kitchen, but that's all
There's silence at first, and then the
' and  are coming down the path with their tools and their lights
They are both clearly fagged out
, : The telephone
Oh, shit
Rachel
He drops the tools and sprints
'  , runs into the side yard
of the phone is louder
, He runs to the door and inside
, He stands there, eyes inscrutable
, It stops
beat later  enters the room
He picks it up, although he already knows it's too late
He listens to the of the dial tone and then drops it back into the cradle, disgusted
He starts to dial a number from memory
(voice) Louis
/  , When you talk to 'em, not one word about what we done tonight
''far's you know, the cat's still fine
, After a moment he lowers it into the cradle
You'll understand
In the meantime, keep your peace
What we did, Louis, was a secret thing
Women are supposed to be the ones who are good at keeping secrets, but any woman who knows anything at all would tell you she's never seen into a man's heart
The soil of a man's heart is stonier, Louis--like the soil up there in the old Micmac burying ground
man grows what he can
and tends it
During this, he's come across the room to  and dropped his hand on ' shoulder
But-- No buts
Accept what's done, Louis
What we done was right
Another time it might not be, but tonight it was
at least  hope to Christ it was
Now you make your call
but not a word about tonight
, : Boops and beeps of a touch-tone telephone
Ringing
Then: (voice) Goldman residence
Hi, Dory
it's Louis-- During this, another  has been growing: an approaching truck
As  gains his side of the road, he looks back, and we read fear on his face--no matter what he said to , he's sorry for tonight's piece of work
moment later a highballing Orinco truck cuts between and
, He's on the phone, smiling and happy
(voice) You want to talk to the birthday girl
That'd be real fine
(voice) Hi
daddy
(sings) Happy birthday to you/Happy birthday to you/Happy birthday, dear Ellie/Happy birthday to you
(voice) That was awful, daddy
Yeah,  know
how are things out there in Chicagoland
Fine
except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair
(grinning broadly) Way to go, Gage
(voice) What
said that's too bad
What did you get for presents from Gramma and Grampa
(voice) Lots of stuff
got two dresses
and a Chatty Cathy doll
, She's dressed for bed, in fuzzy pink pajamas
Her Chatty Cathy is crooked in one arm
In her lap is a Garfield transistor radio
and a Garfield radio
How's Church, dad
Does he miss me
, The smile fades off his face
It's replaced with a look of combined guilt and unhappiness
He's looking at his hands, which are still dark with the dirt from ' grave
Well
guess he's just fine, Ellie
haven't seen him this evening, but-- , , holding , sits on the arm of ' chair
Well, make sure you put him down cellar before you go to bed so he can't run out in the road and get greased
And kiss him goodnight for me
(voice) Yuck
Kiss your own cat
Want to talk to Gage
Before he can answer, she puts the phone in ' hand
and watch, amused, as  gobbles into it
Perhaps encourages him to say a few words
, From the telephone comes the sound of  talking and chortling
is not listening
His eyes--and his mind--are far away
is raking leaves on the side lawn, near the tree with the tire swing
After a moment or two of this he props the rake against the tree and starts toward the garage
He goes in
, It's dim in here
is crossing to the door which communicates to the kitchen
As he passes the station wagon, he hears a cat He turns
, He's on top of the car, but at this point we probably don't notice;   is so close that  looks like he's coming right down our throats
He's hissing angrily
He recoils and stumbles backward with a cry
He hits a tool-rack on the wall and a lot of them fall down with a , He jumps down, frightened by the noise, and the   as he goes flying out the garage door into the sunlight
He gets slowly to his feet again
He's getting over his fright but we can see he's totally freaked out by what gave him that fright
He goes to the garage door and looks out
(calls) Church
, ' Grass and fallen leaves
No sign of
'  , , He's spooning cat-food into a dish
He goes to the door--there should be a total of three doors in the kitchen: one to the living room, one to the shed/garage, and one which leads directly outside
uses this latter door now
, He puts the dish of food down and sits beside it
Food, Church
food
: Miaow
, ' comes slinking out of the bushes and comes slowly toward He stops, looking mistrustful
Come on, Church
Chow down
He crosses to the stoop and begins eating the food
(to himself) Christ
don't believe this
He picks  up
miaows again--he wants the food
(wincing) God, you stink, Church
is looking at the food, trying to get out of ' arms
In a second
He tilts the cat's head back so he can get a look at ' neck
' ,  (' ) There's some sort of mark here--a clear remnant	of the crash line of white fur, or perhaps a dark red scar where no fur at all grows
, sees something else as he lets the cat's neck go
He tweezes something out of ' whiskers
' , It's a shred of green plastic
Chewed his way out
Jesus Baldheaded Christ, he ch-- suddenly claws at his face
Ow
He claps his hand to his face
leaps for the food slowly takes his hand away
There are claw marks on his cheek, welling blood
He looks at the cat
' , The garden is a plot of about half an acre
comes trundling slowly along a row, pushing a wheelbarrow
There are several pumpkins in it
is wearing old khaki gardening pants and a Ramones sweatshirt
He's wearing his headphones and we can hear the Romantics doing "What  Like About You
"  is singing along and bopping a little--as much as his arthritis will allow, if you can dig it
He sees a real big pumpkin, stops, and bends over to get it
He takes out his pocket-knife and slits the pumpkin-vine
He gets the pumpkin in his arms and stands up
He turns
and  is right there (kind of a cheap jump, but always fun), looking totally stunned
, startled, drops the pumpkin
reaches out and slides the phones off ' ears
What did we do
is sitting at the kitchen table
is at the fridge comes back with a couple of long-necked bottles of beer and opens them
most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception
What did we do, Jud
Why, saved a little girl from being unhappy
that's all
Drink up, Louis
drinks about half the beer
tried to tell myself  buried him alive
You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat
But
Wouldn't wash
No
'm a doctor
know death when see it, and Church was dead
He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive
and  feel like 'm going crazy
It was that place, wasn't it
Ayuh
It was the rag-man told me about the place--Stanley Bouchard
Us kids just called him Stanny
He was half Micmac himself
drains his beer
Can  have another one
guess it wouldn't hurt
He gets up and goes to the fridge
, The Micmacs used to bury their dead up there long before the whites came
He returns to the table with the beer
They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried
Then something happened
Half the tribe died in a season
The rest moved on
They said a Wendigo had soured the ground
Wendigo
Spirit of the north country
Not a good spirit
Wendigos are great liars and tricksters, according to the stories
And if one touches you
pauses, perhaps a flustered, and gathers his thoughts
Maybe it really was a Wendigo-- ain't the one to say it wasn't-- or maybe it was just some disease
Whatever the reason, those that were left moved on
But they left that place
the way it is now
shrugs, and drinks
, / The time here is about 1910
is wearing short pants
He's crying, not in any big-deal histrionic way, but as if he means to keep doing it for a long time
mean he looks really sad
(voice) loved my dog a lot, Louis
When Spot died,  thought  was gonna die
is sitting on the front stoop
It's the same house  lives in now, but the porch hasn't been added yet, and the road is dirt rather than tar
Along this road comes a horse-drawn wagon--
' wagon
The wagon's full of junk, rags, bottles
stuff to sell and swap
Strung across the top are bells, and we can hear their but faint, like bells heard in a dream
is old and drunk
Dust spumes up behind the wagon as he draws up to the  house and stops
He gets down, almost falls, takes a bottle out of his back pocket, drinks, and approaches
We can see him speaking
' , You and this old Indian rag-man-- Stanny
did for me what  did for you last night, Louis
Only  wasn't alone when Spot came back
/ '  is back to  , hanging sheets on the line
The sheets billow
And suddenly, pushing out from behind them, quite near her, is a small mongrel dog
He's covered with graveyard dirt
His eyes are red and rolling
He splashes the sheets with the muck of his passage
(voice) My mother was with me
She sees who it is--what it is--and backs away, screaming, horrified
, / (voice) He'd got caught in bobwire that infected
You could still see the marks on him
And so we can, around his neck and along the side of his head
These marks are the counterpart of the marks we've already seen on of '
Like the bells, these are screams heard in a dream
/ The   comes running out, dressed in a night-shirt
' / (' ) She's cringing against the fence at the rear of the yard stands in front of her, swaying from side to side, as if doped
'  (dim; far) Get your dog, Jud
He stinks of the ground you buried him in
Come here and get your dog
She is in utter terror
/ Horrified
ashamed
' / '  (terror) ,  ' How did your mother take it, Jud
How did she take it when your dog came back from the dead
' face is a complication
He's lying to , certainly--but is he also lying to himself
Yes,  think so
Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why  thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night
you did, didn't you, Louis
Yes
Why, then, things should be fine
little upset is all she was
Because 'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown
She got used to the idea
Spot lived another four years
He died peacefully in the night that second time, and buried him in the Pet Sematary
where his bones still lie
, We see them crossing
(voice) You still haven't told me why you did it
, man doesn't always know why he does things, Louis
think  did it because your daughter ain't ready for her favorite pet to die
What
Ellie's a little scared of death
And the main reason Ellie's that way is because your wife is a lot scared of death
Now you just go ahead and tell me 'm wrong
But ' reaction tells him he's not wrong--in fact,  has hit the nail right on the head
, ' hands come into the frame and turn the spigots
, He starts to undress, still looking troubled
We should notice that the door behind him is firmly shut
The bathroom has no windows
The hot water is steaming
' hands enter the frame and turn off the faucets
of  climbing in
big sigh and an expression of exquisite pleasure
He relaxes in the hot water
After a few moments he puts a wet washcloth over his face
, Don't shilly-shally, Louis
Give the little girl her promise
is in his high chair
is at her place, crying
In ' place sits  , bloody and wrecked
sits in his place
On the platter of bacon and scrambled eggs is ' mangled body
The door must not be opened
The barrier must not be crossed
You don't understand-- , The washrag is slipping, but it still covers his face
(mutters) --'m a doctor
In attendance: , , ,  in his high chair
Lying in the middle of the table, clotted with dirt and blood, eyes staring, neck a gory mess of infected wounds, is
He's also dotted with clots of scrambled egg and bits of bacon
Sometimes the dead do more than speak
Remember, doc
, (with great force) Don't shilly-shally, Louis
Promise me
Promise me
Promise me
, The washcloth has slipped enough so we can see his eyes are closed--he's dozing
Promise
To , , , , and the corpse of  enters , his eyes shocked and staring
(to ) You do it for all the best reasons, but that ain't why
You do it because it gets hold of you
you do it because you have to
,   , The washrag has worked its way down to his mouth by now
His doze is deepening; he's started to snore a little
:  splash
Something has been dropped into the bath
opens his eyes
Looks puzzled
Looks down
Eyes widen in shock
, ' very large and very mangled dead rat floats in the bath, actually brushing against ' chest
Blood has begun to stain the water
Turns his head, preparatory to leaping out
, Its mouth yawns open
It hisses, showing bloodstained teeth
leaps from the tub
Grabs a towel and begins to rub himself frantically
He's grossed out
The cat tries to arch against him and he hits it
falls to the floor, hissing
looks at the closed door
How the hell did you get in
He may not know that, but he knows how it's going to get out
He opens the door to the upstairs hall
If  doesn't go at once, helps it with his foot
Then he looks down at: , ' Staring at the rat
Over this:
727 Its landing gear unfolds preparatory to touching down at Bangor International Airport
Lots of people making their way up the jetway
, He's looking anxiously for his people
In one hand he's got half a dozen roses
His face lights up
, ' Here comes ' family
is a little ahead
is pushing  in his stroller
sees  and lights up
Daddy
She runs for him
comes belting up to , weaving among the deplanees like a slalom skier
She leaps into his arms
swings her cheerfully
Hi, sugar
She smacks him noisily
He smacks her back just as noisily
Daddy, is Church all right
' face changes
All at once he's watchful
Yes
guess so
He was sleeping on the front porch when  left
Cause  had a bad dream about him
dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr
Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary
(trying to smile) That was a silly dream, wasn't it
Is he really all right
Yes
Because you promised
know
reaches them
She's pretty tired
Hair hanging in her face, good travelling clothes now looking a bit wrinkled and a bit stale
Want to take your son, doc
does
is ecstatic
kisses  deeply
, at the door, waiting to be let out
does the honors
oils out into the shed/garage
closes the door
She looks distressed
She crosses the kitchen again
, , in a flannel nightgown, is watching
is reading a medical tome and making notes
, zipped into a warm blanket suit, is sacking on the couch
(entering) Can cats have shampoos
Yes--you have to take them to someone who grooms animals, though
think it's pretty expensive
(still upset) don't care
'll save up my allowance and pay for it
Church smells bad
've noticed it, too
'll cough up the money, Ellen
hate that smell
, He looks both grim and sad--a man discovering that what you pay for you own, and what you own always comes home to you
Yes-- hate it, too
And on it, a fourth title card:
:  pen scratching over paper
, single sheet of lined paper is spotlighted by the glow of the desk-lamp
On it, ' right hand is just finishing: "Dr
says Intestinal Cancer
Cannot face this Pain
Sorry
" The hand puts the pen down
It tears the paper in two, leaving just the half with the message
, light comes on and we see a hangman's noose strung over a beam
It dangles above a kitchen table which has been relegated to cellar duty
: Descending footsteps
, of  climbing onto the table
Her face enters the frame
She looks very sick
She puts her head into the noose and rakes it tight at the hyoid bone
, One light on
a cellar light
: Ree-ree-ree
then
: Kick
: Ree-ree-ree
, She hangs limply, hands dangling at her sides, above the table, which now lies upon its side
We can see the note clearly
She pinned it to the bodice of her housedress
: Car engines starting up
People are coming out and getting into their cars and turning on the headlights, even though it is only mid-morning
In the immediate f
g
is a hearse
Four pallbearers are loading a coffin into it
, They're all turning on their lights
Daddy, why are they all turning on their lights in the middle of the day
, dressed in a rusty old black suit and a black tie, comes out and stands with them
He looks haggard and old
They do it to honor the dead, Ellen
Is that right, dad
Yes
To honor the dead
More cars start up; more lights come on; the back doors of the hearse swing closed
[: In the book  finds it difficult to enter at night because of a high iron fence
Here we should see there's no such problem; there's only a low stone wall between the graveyard and the public road
] The mourners are of course gathered around the grave of The coffin rests above it on runners
(voice) May the Lord bless you and keep you; may the Lord make his face to shine upon you, and comfort you, and lift you up, and give you peace
Amen
, , As the mourners begin to break up, these three start back toward ' car
Rachel not feeling well
Well
a touch of the flu
She's in bed
She was throwing up
Ever since Mrs
Rogers called and said Missy-- That's enough, Ellen
They've reached the  station wagon
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis
This babe has said enough
He opens the front passenger door
Hop in, Ellie
She does, and  closes the door
Poor Missy
God,  was sorry to hear
remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust
don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on
My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits
" Ayuh
how is your cat, Louis
It's Ellie's cat
Nope
He's your cat now
opens one of the back doors as  goes around to the driver's side
has tilted over in one corner and is snoring
His Walkman 'phones are on and we can hear the tinny sounds of Billy Idol little old man's drool trickles down from one corner of his mouth
:
, Tears are spilling freely down ' face
Ellie
What's wrong
No more chocolate chip cookies
Huh
Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world--even Mom said so
Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever
She cries harder
reaches out and strokes her hair
, Moving up the country road toward home through blazing fall foliage
, On it is a scene from "Night of the Living Dead
" Bizarre as it may seem, it now seems almost beyond doubt: the dead are returning to eat the living
(voice) Daddy
There's a  on top of the ;  has been watching "Night
" Now he quickly uses the remote control to shut down the
She's dressed for bed, and comes toward him slowly
What's up, sugar
Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven
What
, She's putting away the last of the supper things
She hears this and moves toward the living room door to listen
She doesn't look at all well
Her eyes are red from crying and her face is haggard
, She's gotten up into his lap
At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell
Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell
Well,  think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear
, She smiles a little at this
, But don't you dare say that
won't
is Missy in heaven, do you think
don't know, honey
Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die
Some believe in heaven or hell
Some think we're born again as little children-- Sure, carnation
Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea
And some people think we just wink out
like a candle flame when the wind blows hard
Do you believe that
looks toward: ,  , ' is sleeping
think we go on
'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- have faith in that
You believe in it
Oh, faith's a little more than just believing
, Listening intently
(continues) 'll tell you what faith is--it's the evidence of the heart; the assurance of things not seen
don't get it
Well, here we are, sitting in my chair
Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow
Yeah, sure
Then you have faith in that
But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right
' giggling
, She's smiling, too
but tears are running down her cheeks
But we plan on that chair
We believe in that chair
And  plan on going on somehow as Louis Creed, after  die
believe  will
(awed) You have faith in that
Yes ma'am
Just like  have faith that it is now time for Ellen Creed to get ready for bed
So buzz
He gets her off his lap
'm not tired
'm sure you're not
Then why do  have to go to bed
Because your mother and  need the rest, sugar
Now buzz
She heads toward the stairs
' is in bed, reading
, wearing a robe over her nightgown, comes in
heard you tonight
thought maybe you did
know you don't approve of the subject being raised-- That's not true
The subject scares me
Because of Zelda
puts his book down and looks at her thoughtfully
Your sister,  know
sits down on the end of the bed
She's clasping her hands nervously together
Sometimes you're so good with her, Louis--so straight with her--that you make me ashamed of myself
sits up and scoots down the bed to her
He tries to put an arm around her
She rejects it--but gently
'm sorry  couldn't go with you to Missy's funeral
And that blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard
That's forgotten
Not by me, it isn't
know how badly  acted, how unfair  was
It's just that
you know
Yes,  guess  do
He makes a place for her beside him and hugs her
They lie silently together for awhile, taking comfort from each other
'm going to try to do better
You're doing fine
: And on it, a fifth title card:
: An idling truck motor
It looks monstrous
as high as a mountain
, It's an Orinco tanker
The driver, a young man in khaki fatigues and a baseball cap, climbs up into the cab
He slams the door and jams the truck into gear
(voice) knew something like this would happen
The truck comes rolling slowly toward the main gate
stops so the driver can look both ways
and then pulls slowly out onto 9
(voice continues) told her when you were first married
'You'll have all the grief you can stand, and more,'  said
, There are others here, but they are in the b
g
, and concentrating on the scene the old man is making
He's ' dad
is sitting in the aisle seat of a pew-like bench
He looks terribly shattered--they both do, actually
He's staring at the old man as if he cannot in the least comprehend what he's saying
(continues) And now look at this
He gestures toward: Here, half-buried in floral tributes, is a child-sized coffin
'
(weeping) Run over in the road like a
a chipmunk
9, / Getting up to speed
, There's a hand holding it--'
The kite begins to move and It flaps and flutters
, He runs with the kite beneath a gorgeous fall sky in which fat clouds move like airy ocean liners
(voice) Go, daddy
The remains of a picnic lunch are spread here
Looks like everyone ate well
In attendance: , , , and
Go, dayee
They all laugh-- ruffles the kid's hair
, He's paying out string--and the kite is going up
(voice) Where's Rachel
, looks toward: , They are by the sign-in book
Both are dressed in black
Both look haggard
But  looks more than haggard; she looks damned near insane with grief and horror
(leaning forward) With her mother
Where she should be
As for you,  hope you rot in hell
In hell, do you hear me
We should; by now he's screaming his head off
The driver is whistling
transistor radio hangs from the rear- view mirror on a strap
He turns it on
The Ramones
"Sheena
" Hey-ho, let's go

' Stamping the pedal closer to the metal
Belting toward
of the
, has clearly gotten it up okay
, He's holding the string, looking up at the sky
Now he looks back at the picnic table
Hey, Gage
gets down and runs toward his father
9 Belting along fast
of the Ramones
, runs to his dad, chubby legs working
He reaches him, and transfers thee ball of string to ' hands
Dat
String
You're flying it, Gage--you got the hammer, my man
Gage fline it
Bet your boots
Look-- puts his hands over ' hands and pulls them down
It dips in the sky
See
Gage fline it
(tenderly) Bet your ass, little hero
He kisses his son
They look up at: Dipping and drifting in that gorgeous fall sky
(voice) Where were you while he was playing in the road
Thinking about your stupid medical articles
You stinking shit
You killer of children
, You-- But there is no way he can express his outrage with mere words
As sits staring numbly up at him,  punches him in the nose
sprawls backward, falling out of the pew onto the floor
, screams and starts forward
pulls her back
Louis
Daddy
Stop it
is getting up groggily
Hs nose is pouring blood
How do you like that, you son of a bitch
should have done it sooner
punches him in the stomach
"oofs" and doubles over
Among them we see   and
(getting up) Hey
is slowly straightening up
is in a sour frenzy of glee
How do you like that
How do-- pushes the old man with both hands
He goes stumbling and flailing backwards
strikes the coffin
knocks it off its bier
goes up from the mourners
screams
Her mother struggles to hold her but  easily breaks free and goes running down the aisle
, Stop them
Right now
gets up and goes toward: , He's picking himself out of a tangled mess of coffin and overturned floral tributes
His suit is wet from spilled water
He's weeping
has just reached him, and that stunned look is gone
think he intends to do the Cool Jerk all over  ' puny little body
strikes a Gentleman Jim Corbett pugilistic pose
Come on
'm ready for ya
'll take y'apart
As  wades in,   gets between them
at the last possible moment
Stop it
swings
manages to block the punch with his body
Stop it
Jesus, what's wrong with you, Louis
It's your son's funeral, not a boxing match
That gets to
He drops his fists
That stunned expression creeps over his face again--that look that says he doesn't have the slightest clue as to what's going on or how it could possibly have happened
(voice) The soil of a man's heart is stonier, doc-- turns toward: , , bloody and ruined in his jogging shorts and muscle shirt, has the pew to himself
except for , who is sitting on his lap and
man grows what he can
and tends it
, sense of horrible awareness comes into his face
and then he covers it with his hands and begins to
,  :
The trucker is singing along with the radio
It's closer to the floorboards than ever
, We are at some distance--far enough to see that the two of them have moved quite close to the road
,    (' ) We can see their faces upturned to us--we can hear the of the kite itself
--to the road
And we can see the truck, fairly close by now, and coming closer
,  , , ' lighting a cigarette
His Walkman 'phones are around his neck
want to fly it
Can  fly it now, mommy
In a minute, hon
Let Gage finish his turn
This is the last moment of happiness in this man's life--so let's make it very happy
As he and  stare up at the kite: (voice) Jesus
Louis
'm sorry-- The fight has gone out of  and  has backed away--but cautiously
He's ready to jump back in if one or the other goes mad again
But  is shuffling toward , hands out-- everyone else has gathered in a knot near the front of the chapel
Among them is  and her mother, weeping in each others' arms
don't know what happened to me
Louis, please-- brushes by him with no acknowledgement that  even exists
He kneels down slowly by the coffin and puts his head against it
(weeping) 'm sorry, Gage--'m so sorry, little hero
, There's a strong gust of wind
The ball of string falls out of ' hand
, It got away from him
That numb shit
(outraged) Ellen Creed
It is bouncing and unraveling
More importantly, it is being carried directly toward the highway
He takes off after the ball of twine
Kite fline too fast
: The oncoming truck
Slamming toward us--a brutal leviathan on eighteen wheels
He's looking--looking toward his people at the picnic table
(shrugs, good-humored) What can you d- Alarm hits ' face
He rises
Don't let him go in the road, Louis
looks; registers terrible alarm
(screams) Get him, Louis
He's still scampering after the bouncing ball of kite-twine, which has now almost reached the road
The  is loud enough so he's having trouble hearing
(cups his ear) What
(shrieks) is running toward the road, although he'll never get to in time; only  has a chance
Horrible understanding dawns on his face
He whips around and sees: , ' The kid's almost in the road; the ball of twine is in it
, (cheerful) Geddit-geddit-geddit
, ' reaches the middle of the road as the truck comes around the corner
is running across the field, getting close to the side of the road
is clutching  by the picnic table
is helplessly trying to wave the truck down as it passes him
, As he reaches the broken white line he grabs the ball of string
turns his head
(not afraid) Druck
, ' Suddenly  ' face turns into a Halloween mask of horror
He   -

The other photos (the good ones, that is; not the screamers--those, we may assume, exist only in ' tortured memory) are scattered on the table
We only saw a few; there are actually hundreds
puts the photo down as  comes in and crosses to the fridge
' nose is badly swelled
He also has a black eye
gets a couple of beers and comes back toward the table
Your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old guy
He and his wife gone back to Chicago
No
squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures
He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them
Her and Ellie
Louis-- The swing door opens
They look toward: She looks dazed and shocked
There are brown circles under her eyes, but otherwise her complexion is much too white
She's wearing fuzzy pj's
She's carrying the picture of her pulling on the sled
, (coming to the table) want to go back to my own room
can't sleep with mommy
She keeps stealing the covers
What you got there, Ellie
At first she doesn't want to show him, but  is very kind
(studying it) Why that's real nice
you pullin' him on a sled
Bet he liked that, didn't he
nods
She is starting to cry
is also leaking at the eyes
(crying) used to pull 'im a lot
, looking down at his hands, nods
'm going to carry this picture, Mr
Crandall, until God lets Gage come back
reacts violently
And  looks up, dully curious
but hasn't the thought already passed through ' mind
Yes-- think it has
Ellie
God doesn't do things like that
know you loved y'brother, but-- He can if He wants to
He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on
But  have to keep things ready for him, that's what  think
've got his picture and 'm going to sit in his chair-- Ellie-- And 'm going to eat his breakfast cereal, too, even though it tastes like boogers
And
and
She bursts into tears
Louis, take care of your little girl
she needs you
, His face is stricken
' comes in with  in his arms
He puts her gently into her bed and pulls the covers up
She's already mostly asleep
(kisses her) Good night, Ellie
'night daddy
He starts for the door
, God could take it back if He wanted to, couldn't He
If He really, really wanted to
Can  have faith in that
, He stands looking at her for a long time, apparently thinking about this quite deeply
Yes-- suppose you can
Good night, Ellie
He steps out, closing the door
, In some sense comforted--it may be a poison comfort but she surely doesn't know this--she turns over on her side to go to sleep
We can see the picture of  under her arm
, The light here is fairly dim
goes down and opens another door
He pokes his head in
, He reacts first with surprise, then a species of horrified disgust
' , ' is crouched on ' sleeping form
, comes in and swats the cat a damned good one
(low snarl) Fuck off, hairball
, It hisses at him through a mouthful of fangs, its eyes big green balls
and then it flees
out the door
, stirs and mutters thickly, then lies still again
she's doped to the gills
bends over and kisses her gently
He leaves the room and closes the door behind him
, He tries the door a couple of times to make sure it's firmly on the latch (his face wears an expression of "How'd he get in there in the first place
")
Then he walks down the hall to the stairs
, The cat is on one of the risers
trips over it
, For a moment he's pinwheeling madly for balance, on the verge of falling
He regains his balance as the cat goes shooting across the dining room toward the kitchen
regains his equilibrium after a bit and continues on down
, As  enters through the swing door from the dining room, is just letting  out the back door
As  closes the door: (slightly antagonistic) thought you'd be gone by now
got you a fresh beer out of the fridge, Louis
He indicates the table, where there is indeed a fresh beer
Jud,  buried my son today and 'm very tired
wonder if we could just-- You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis
'm thinking about going to bed
But he begins pouring the beer into a glass
You never asked me if anyone had buried a person up there in the Micmac burying ground-- ' hand jerks
Beer goes foaming across the kitchen table
--but  think the thought has crossed your mind
Shit
Look at this mess
Ayuh--it's a mess, all right
As  goes to get a cloth to wipe up the mess: know the Micmacs thought it was a holy place
and then they thought it was a cursed place
That's why they moved on
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground
And because the dead walked
stops sopping and looks at him
, Oh, ayuh
It's been done
What you've been thinking of has been done
/ The time is the late summer of 1944, although  don't believe we need to know that specifically
The sign on the station reads There are a few 40s cars parked near the station--they have gas-ration coupons on the windshields
And a hearse
train is coming
,     / We can see the  is trying to talk to  , a man in his forties who periodically wipes his brow with a bandana
walks away
He doesn't want to talk; he doesn't want comfort
He's a grief-stricken, bitter man
(voice over) Timmy Baterman was on his way home from the war with his Purple Heart when he got killed in some stupid car accident down in Georgia
,     / The door of the mail-car is open
The  and three trainmen are unloading  ' coffin, which is draped in a 48-star flag
stands by, watching balefully as they carry his son's final apartment to the back of the hearse and load it in
(v-o continues) Bill was bitter--his son had been in the thick of it two years and then got shot in the leg--a clean flesh-wound
He was supposed to be coming home safe and sound
Instead, he come home in a box after all
/ The doors close
The hearse pulls away , who stands staring balefully after it and mopping his brow
(v-o continues) He wasn't able to get to the bottom of the truth, Louis
, is now sitting down, drinking a beer, staring at

Why

That's all
Sometimes dead is better

It ain't your wife and little girl that's got me worried, Louis

It stops, and   gets out

(voice-over) Timmy was buried on July 22nd, as remember
/ He reaches in
and brings out a pick and shovel
: ,   / She's a middle-aged woman dressed in mid-forties style
She's got a rug-beater in one hand; the other is up to her eyes to shade the sun
She's staring at something, horrified
(v-o continues) It was four or five days later when
,   / young man dressed in jeans and a plaid shirt is shambling up the road
His eyes are vacant
His shirt is half untucked
His hair is sticking up in a wild crow's-nest thatch
There is an ugly mess of healed scars on his neck and one side of his face
think one of his ears may be gone--torn off in the accident
(v-o continues) Margie Washburn seen him walking up the road toward Yorkie's Livery
/ She's screaming--we hear her faintly
/ He turns toward her and we see a green light like the St
Elmo's fire in the Little God Swamp glow dimly deep in his eyes
He grins at

(v
o
) Lots of people saw Timmy Baterman walking back and forth between the home place and the town line
But it was Margie
,  / She's in a hallway in front of a door with printed on the frosted glass
After a moment she opens it and goes in
(v
o
continues) who finally got up enough guts to talk to the town fathers about it
She knew it had to be stopped, Louis
' / and four men are grouped around a desk
She's talking; they're listening

George Anderson, the town postmaster, was there
and Alan Purinton
Hannibal Benson

/ It's a ramshackle old farm which looks remarkably like the estate of that gentleman farmer Jordy Verrill
An old Ford pulls into the driveway, and the four men get out
: Most of all the
They go to the door, and  is wordlessly elected as the prime honcho
He knocks
No answer
Again
No answer
: Crazy laughter
(voice) Stop that, Timmy
The four men look at each other
Come on
They start around to the back
,    / is staring directly into the setting sun, his eyes glowing with green fire
He's laughing like Goofy gone insane
, scared, is trying to make him stop, to turn away from the sun
,   / The four men come around the side of the house
They freeze when they see  and
Oh holy Jesus lookit that
whirls around and sees them
You men get out of here
heard your boy was killed down Georgia
(agitated) That was a mistake
Was it
You see him standing there, don't you
Now get out
Get the Christ off my land
Now  turns around and comes shambling forward
(laughing) Ge ow
Ge Cwise off eye an
(revolted) Oh Jesus, Jud
He's dead

He ain't dead
Give him a day or two and he'll be fine
Don't you say that
Bill, this ain't right--you can see that yourself-- (screaming) / (laughing) Dead
We love dead
Hate living
Abruptly he reaches up with both hands and scratches down his cheeks, goring deep grooves in his flesh
Blood flows sluggishly out
Very weird blood
/ grabs , who's still laughing wildly, and gets him turned around
shambles back to where he was originally standing
goes with him like a man who has charge over a trained baboon
stupid trained baboon
(over his shoulder) You want to get out of here before  get my shotgun
You boys are trespassing

(voice) Who's there
(laughing, screeching voice) Ooo air
Ooo air
Get out, Billy--the place is going up

Burning
Going up fast
You think Bill's gonna get out, Jud
(stony) If he don't, he don't
It bursts open
We see two men struggling at the forefront of an inferno--correction, one man and an undead monster
is giggling and screaming, trying to pull his father back into the flames
(struggling) No
No, Timmy
Let me go
(laughing) Love dead
Hate living
He sinks his teeth into his father's arm
screams
beam falls on , lighting him afire
breaks free and runs down the porch steps
, He's burning and laughing
And into the fire he goes, still shrieking and laughing
is collapsed on the lawn as sparks drift down around him, his face hidden against his thighs, weeping
on the four men, who are grouped at the end of the driveway by the road and staring with awe at: : , (softly) Sometimes dead is better, Louis
And on it, a sixth title card:
:
jet plane rises into the sky from behind the building
' This is the final call for United's flight 61 to Chicago

we can see  and   waiting by the jetway with  as the last few passengers board
looks confused and grief-stricken
She also looks punchy, doped up imagine she's floating on a sea of Valium, and that makes her easier to deal with
' battle-scars are fading a little
The   is standing by the jetway with a mike in one hand and a bunch of boarding passes in the other
(concludes) All passengers should now be aboard
You better get going, hon
Oh Louis,  just don't know about this-- told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks
If something good doesn't come of Gage's death,  think 'll go crazy
Louis, are you sure
'm sure
, don't want to go to Chicago, Gramma Dory
Why not, darling
had a bad dream last night nightmare
(kindly) About what
About Daddy
(Pause) And Gage
and  exchange a knowing, sad glance over the child's head
And someone named Paxcow
guides her to the jetway
Come on, you guys--before you miss the boat
He kisses
hugs him
Louis,  am sorry
What can  say
That  lost my mind
It's the truth, but no good excuse
(hugs him back) We all lost our minds, Irwin
kisses
Then he kneels and hugs
Be good to your mother, darlin'
She needs you
Come with us, daddy
Please come with us
'll be there in three days--four at the most
've got to get the electricity shut off and square things with your school so the truant officer ain't after you, and-- , (crying) Please, daddy
'm scared
Of what
(crying harder) don't know
(great emphasis) Everything's going to be all right, Ellie
Now go on--get aboard
Do you swear
swear
The Voice of Authority has spoken
We can tell by ' face that while things are still not all right, they are a little better
She joins her mother
The four of them--, , and  --start down the jetway
looks back once, as if begging him to come
and then they're gone
, ' face changes
Now it is a stony and contemplative face
Not, when you get right down to it, a very nice face
He turns and strides away
, The family station wagon is in the f
g
We hear the , and as  reaches the wagon he turns and watches: ,, ' From behind it a United Airlines jet lifts into view and banks away
, Face set, he gets into the wagon and drives away
15 The CREEDmobile pulls up across from the Brewer Tru-Value Hardware and  crosses to it
, On it:  six-cell flashlight, Duracell -batteries, a pick, a shovel, and a nylon drop-sheet in cellophane packaging
Now the ' hands come into the frame and drop a pair of heavy work- gloves into the pile
( , -) Anything else for you today
(after a look) think we got it all
The  starts to ring things up
Looks like heavy work
It could be
The quality of ' reply is somehow unnatural
The  looks at him, momentarily unsure and uncertain
Then he starts ringing things up again
, is in the window-seat, asleep
is holding a paperback but not reading it
Her eyes are red
She's looking into space
Her sleep is not easy
Her head turns from side to side, as if in negation
She becomes steadily more upset
She's starting to mutter
Suddenly her eyes flare open and she screams
, We can see the  in the seats behind the
They are startled
So are other passengers
stewardess comes running
Paxcow says it's almost too late
Ellie
Ellie
what
Paxcow says it's almost too late
We have to go back
Paxcow says it's almost too late
The  wagon turns in and drives up one of the lanes
It stops and  gets out
He walks to a fresh grave on which the first flowers are already starting to wilt
He sits down and takes a flower
He plucks it, looking at the grave steadily
He says nothing for a long time
It's wrong
(Pause) What happened to you is wrong
, He runs toward  , happy and laughing, in
,  ' is now weeping, but he seems calm just the same
(voice) Remember, doc
looks at: , ' , bloody and mutilated, is standing by it
The barrier was not meant to be crossed
The ground is sour
,  ' He is not put out of countenance in the slightest by ' appearance; he probably knows  is just a figment of his conscience or imagination, and so do we
'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour
Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong
Timmy Baterman
That was wrong
,  ' Don't talk like an asshole even if you are just a bit of underdone potato or a blot of mustard
, He stands mute, just looking
(weeping) He was my son
He wasn't even two and he was run down in the fucking road and he was almost in pieces, and if you don't think 'm going to try
, has put on his boogie shoes
,  ' He's crying harder
Abruptly he reaches out at the floral tributes and knocks a bunch of them over
If it doesn't work--if he comes back like Timmy Baterman--'ll put him to sleep
But 'm going to try
(Pause) And if it doesn't work
they don't ever need to know
, along this hallway, which is lined with pictures of ,
and  (there may even be a couple in which  is featured, but damned few)
Near the end of the hall a door is open and light spills out
(voice) Honey, you just had a bad dream
You know that, don't you
(voice) It wasn't a dream
It was Paxcow
and into the room where  is staying
She's in bed, still badly upset
is sitting on the bed beside her
There's a single lamp on the bedside table
Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad
He-- Who is this Paxcow
Is he like the boogeyman
He's a ghost
But he's a good ghost
turns off the bed-lamp
There are no ghosts, Ellie
want you to go to sleep and forget all this nonsense
Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay
Of course  will
She kisses
Now will you try to go to sleep
(turns over on her side) Yes, Mom
gets up and leaves the room
is here, halfway down the hall to the stairs, bloody as ever
doesn't see him
She looks perplexed, a woman trying to think of something
She stops very near him
(to herself) Paxcow, why do  know that name
Pascow
suddenly straightens
She looks startled and afraid
Pascow
Was she saying Pascow
She suddenly heads for the stairs, fast
:  car starting up
The station wagon backs out and heads down the driveway
As it passes  , we see  driving
The wagon turns onto Route 9 and heads off
beat of silence
Then: the telephone starts ringing
and  are watching  with some anxiety
is holding the phone to her ear
We can hear the   of one ring after another
She hangs up
He's not home
Why, he probably went out for a hamburger or a chicken dinner, dear
You know how men are when they're alone
Good old ' face says that maybe  went out for a couple of grams of coke and a whore in Nazi  boots
is dialing another number
: Phone starts to ring
, He shuffles to the telephone
His Walkman 'phones are around his neck
He's got a bottle of beer in one hand
(picks up) Hello--you got Judson
, It's Rachel Creed, Jud
'm calling from Chicago
(surprised voice) Chicago
Is Louis with you
No
we're going to be here awhile, and he wanted a few days to wind up our affairs there
just wondered if he was with you
, His face says this is very serious
No--but if he drops by, 'll tell him to call you
Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work
The one that was hit by a car
(voice) don't-- Was it Pascow
, Ayuh,  think 'twas
If  see Louis come home before  go to bed, 'll tell him to-- , Don't bother
'm coming home
(alarmed voice) Rachel
Thank you, Jud
Goodbye
She hangs up
, No
Rachel
Don't do that
Rachel--
The buzz of an open line
Connection broken
slowly replaces the receiver
The man looks very grim
comes down the stairs, dressed for travelling
She's carrying a suitcase in one hand
Her parents meet her at the foot of the stairs
Rachel
darling
you're upset
a night's sleep
have to go
The connections are tight, and  have to be at 'Hare in forty minutes
Will you drive me, daddy
You know something's wrong, don't you
You know
And Ellie does, too
Yes
'll drive you
(voice) Mommy
They all turn to: , Please hurry
will
Come and kiss me
races into her arms
Of a car engine,
It cuts off
on the low stone wall between the cemetery and the road
Beyond it we can see the roof of the  station wagon
appears, dressed in dark clothes
He looks both ways, then tosses a big duffle bag over the wall
Stuff clanks inside
climbs over the wall, grabs his bag, and checks out the scene
, ' quiet city of the dead
Spooky
of crickets: Ree-ree- ree
He heads for ' grave
, 'll come with you if you want, honey
(shakes her head) 've got three planes to catch and got the last seats on two of them
It's like God saved them for me
'   ,  ' ' car heads for it
approaches it slowly and sets down his bag of grave-robbing equipment
He sets aside the remaining floral tributes and then opens the bag and takes out the spade
He looks down at the grave for a long second
(low) Gonna bust you out, son
He starts to shovel
, Digging
throwing
digging again
Already the shape of the excavation is beginning to show
The work is easy; this earth is new and fresh
,   - , Everyone looks impatient, but  looks half crazy
(voice) This is the Captain speaking
'm sorry about this delay, folks, but we've got a real low ceiling tonight and air traffic control's playing it safe
Looks like it's going to be about half an hour before we get on a roll, so 'm turning off the   sign
: Bing
There's a general groan
, who has closed her eyes
think she's praying
' Now it's pretty deep
Four feet, maybe
is standing in it
We see his feet as the shovel goes up and down, up and down
He's sweating and dirt-streaked
He's tossing dirt on a big pile
Suddenly, as he takes another shovelful, we hear a
He tosses the shovel aside and squats
, There's a white streak on the bottom of the grave--the top of ' coffin
swipes his hand through the loose dirt, uncovering more, and then he begins to sweep off the top of the coffin with his hands
comes out
He's wearing a light jacket
His Walkman 'phones are around his neck
He's got a six-pack
He looks at: , ' It's dark
, He sits down
You done it, you stupid old man
now you got to undo it
He puts his earphones on
Cracks a beer
Lights a cigarette
Pushes the  button on the deck
Faint  of The Clash buzz-sawing "Rock The Casbah
" begins to watch
He climbs out of the grave and opens his duffle bag
He starts to pull out the pick
of an approaching car
freezes
police car comes cruising slowly along
The spotlight on the driver's side comes on and runs along the graveyard's stone wall
Watching
Waiting
Hardly breathing
It reaches the end of the wall
Everything looks jake
The spotlight goes out and the police car speeds up
He relaxes perceptibly
He gets the pick and drops back into the grave
, inserts the tip of the pick in the flange of the coffin and levers it
Again
More
Again
And the lock breaks
The coffin lid comes up a little, dirt gritting in the hinges
, Here's a man on the thinnest edge between sanity and madness
' Think you'll make your connection in Boston
have to
,  ' He's lying on his stomach, reaching in
We hear the  of dirt grating in hinges again
, We're looking up into his face
If  had a , this would be it
' face fills with a terrible grief
Oh, Gage--oh, honey
, His chin slips to his chest, even though we hear Creedence on his 'phones and to him the sound must be at blastoff levels
There's a long round ash on his cigarette in the tray
couple of empty beer cans on the table beside him
truck blasts by, startling him out of his doze
He jerks his head up suddenly
and slaps himself
He's okay
for now
, He is sitting on the edge of the grave, holding his dead son in his arms, rocking him
is back to us
We see only a small limp figure in a dark suit
Hair flops limply
It's going to be all right swear it's going to be all right
The canvas tarp has been spread open to the right
begins to lay his son down on it
, It's littered with flower petals
One limp hand appears among them
He closes the tarp over , making a roll
He then produces rope from the duffle bag
He cuts the rope and begins to tie one piece around one end of the canvas roll containing the corpse of his son
(voice) Good evening again, ladies and gentlemen
, Her seatmate is knitting something
Across the aisle sits , bloody but serene, hands clasped in his lap, looking straight ahead
looks around tensely
(continues) 'm delighted to tell you that we've got a strong tail-wind tonight and we expect to arrive at Boston's Logan Airport almost on time
clenches his fist in a "That's one for our side
" gesture
(softly) Thank God
Her  looks at her a bit strangely
, He's got the bundle containing his son and the duffle-bag with the tools
He runs bent over
He reaches the wall and there's the of another motor
He crouches at the base of the wall
Here comes that same police car
The spotlight runs along the wall
Crouching against his side of the wall and sweating
It stops
The  gets out
He walks slowly toward the wall
Crouched
Now we see the  looking over the top
If he looks down
but he doesn't
Instead he turns around so we see his back
looks up, miserably scared, pouring sweat
Silence
Then:  of the cop taking a whiz
Ah
Relief
of his fly being zipped
He looks back at the cemetery for a moment
ain't afraid of no ghost
He walks back to his cruiser, gets in, and hauls ass
, He collapses with relief
Then he gets up and looks cautiously over the wall
Nothing there but his car, parked a little way down on the other side of the road
He tosses the duffle bag over the top of the wall
He puts the canvas roll containing  on top of the wall
Then he vaults over
, He takes the roll, gets the duffle bag hooked over his shoulder by the string, and runs across the road like a soldier crossing enemy territory
He goes to the rear of the wagon
, He puts the body down
He feels in his pocket for his keys
No keys
Mild consternation
He looks around, feeling exposed
The other pocket
Still no keys
More consternation
He begins to hunt feverishly through his pockets
Maybe in his jacket
Nope
: An approaching car
civilian--not the ubiquitous cop
He turns his pockets out, spilling change everywhere
Nothing
Suddenly a little light goes on in his eyes
He goes to the driver's side of the car and looks in at: , ' The keys are in the switch
He snatches the keys and returns to the back of the wagon
He uses the key to open the doorgate
He puts ' body in gently, then the duffle bag
He closes the doorgate and returns to the front of the car
He opens the driver's door and freezes
returns to the rear, gets his keys from the doorgate, comes back to the front, gets in, and drives away
People are debarking into the gate area
Through them comes , running fast, pushing some people, excusing herself incoherently
is walking near her
There's just time
If you run
Without looking at ,  takes off her shoes and runs
, She's sprinting down the concourse--look out, Joanie Benoit
27, The    is starting to close the jetway door
Don't do that, babe
The   looks puzzled, as if she just had a thought (or maybe a gas pain)
She stops closing the door
runs into the area
She sees: /
, It is just starting to swing ponderously away from the jetway
(  ) Make it come back
can't-- bolts down the jetway
The   stares after her, and then runs for her stand, where we can see  61 and  on the slide-cards
She picks up her mike
stands all alone at the end of it
(screams) ,
, ' It starts to swing back to pick her up
appears behind her and puts a hand on her shoulder
You're doing just fine
, He's fast asleep with the tinny sound of Graham Parker coming out of his Walkman 'phones
: An approaching car
The station wagon turns in and parks
gets out
He opens the back, removes the body in the tarp and the duffle bag filled with tools
He manages to get everything together and walks to the edge of the path
He looks at: , ' Off it goes, glimmering in the dark
He holds the corpse of his little boy to him
Please God--let this work
He sets off
, Zonked out
He missed the whole thing
Nice going, Jud
, Louis passes under like a ghost
, is crying
He crosses to the deadfall
Ain't gonna stop, Gage
Ain't gonna look down
He begins to mount the deadfall
, He reaches the top
And woven into the deadfall, behind him, facing the Pet Sematary, is that snarling face
descends the other side
, reaches the bottom and looks at: , ' The path winds onward through those gigantic trees--it glows slightly
, , That phosphorescent glow is a lot more pronounced
of and
The water is mucky and still
Hummocks stick up like knobs on the back of a creature best not seen
Fog drifts through the dead trees
doesn't want to go in there
Smart man
wouldn't either
But he does
,      -- is lounging back against the rack of folders--and getting some of them bloody
'm sorry
it's been very busy tonight
really don't have anything
What about the Aries  with the scratch on the side
The  starts looking through her papers
do have an Aries , but it came in sort of beat up--there's a long scrape up one side-- 'll take it
, He comes walking toward   with  in his arms and the duffle bag over his shoulder
Mist swirls around him
The landscape is weird, surreal
,
In fact there are a lot of swampy, marshy --too many
It sounds almost prehistoric
: , stops
He looks slowly around at: -, ' demonic face takes shape in the mist and It runs out a tongue that's about nine feet long
Its eyes blow out
Blood and thick, gooey stuff runs from the sockets
He closes his eyes
After a moment he opens them
, ' Nothing there
See
Just imagination
Just-- ' We can barely see them because they are thick in mist, but he is standing on a couple of low, marshy tussocks
Suddenly a thick tentacle slimes its way out of the standing water and slithers around his ankle
, Nothing
there
He turns around and begins to walk again
' The tentacle falls away
, , none of them pleasant--laughter, gobbling howls, screams
Sounds like the swamp has been invaded by a pack of escaped lunatics
continues on regardless
comes into the frame
He's obviously tiring now, but he keeps moving along
: Approaching footsteps
Big ones
Thudding ones
Something is coming which sounds approximately the size of a Tyrannosaurus Rex
And it just keeps getting louder and louder and louder looks plenty scared
:  falling tree
, ' Those  keep getting closer and closer
Another tree falls-- we see this one
And now we see a --just a
He's scared almost to death
His face turns up
up
up
--  , ' It is vaguely manlike: perhaps sixty feet tall, perhaps eighty
We don't see it very well, nor do we have to--'m not even sure it's flesh and blood
But there is a clear suggestion of a head
Now it turns and looks down
looks at
We see great yellow eyes the size of lighthouse lamps
It makes a huge
and then walks on
The    is slowly diminishing
It was the Wendigo
Dear God, think the Wendigo just passed within sixty feet of me
Slowly he begins to walk again
, In the extreme f
g
is a tree which has just fallen--it is no small tree, either, but a great big old fir
approaches it
Stops
Looks at the tree
Looks down at: , ' Here is a gigantic animal track--if it was full of water, could swim in it
It looks like no animal track we've ever seen before
Three big claws at the end of it
Looks up again
His face is set and hard
It doesn't matter
Come on, Gage
He starts to walk again
: The wind, lonesome and keening
toward the slope, dreaming its way over those rocky cairns
most of them burst apart
: Tortured breathing
Panting
toils his way into view, carrying his bundle
He reaches the top
He makes his way slowly into the burying ground
He stumbles over a rock
Falls down
Slowly gathers his things together and gets up again
He goes a little further and then stops and looks at: , ' We can also see the shredded remains of a green garbage bag
He slowly kneels down
He puts the canvas tarp to one side and slowly takes the pick and shovel from the duffle bag
By now he is clearly a man approaching total exhaustion
, It tracks past
Both of them look tense
is bolt upright behind the wheel
Suddenly,
as one of the tires blow
It goes skidding and slueing across the road, the rear tire half off the rim
climbs the curb and hits a tree
She lurches forward, but she's wearing her seat-belt--good girl
She unbuckles it and gets out
She looks at the car, which now has quite a bit more wrong with it than just a scratch up the side
slumps, near tears
isn't the only one who's been through a lot tonight
Now what
comes from around the tree as  walks to the road, looking for cars, or something
He looks urgent and upset
It's trying to stop you
Do you hear me
It's trying to stop you
looks around uncertainly
a little afraid
As she scans the scene she looks at--and through--
Is anyone there
After a moment of silence she turns back to the road
Lights appear and brighten as a car approaches
steps to the shoulder and after a moment she sticks out her thumb, surely for the first time in her life
The car sweeps by her without slowing
' , ' hands enter the shot and put a few more rocks on it and we see him surveying his work
Beside him is the canvas tarp, now open and empty
Absently,  stuffs the tarp into the duffle bag (where his tools have also been replaced) and stands up with a wince
One hand goes to his lower back
He looks down at the cairn
Come back to me, Gage
Come back to us
He turns away toward the stairs
,   9 She's walking down the shoulder with her high heels in one hand
Lights
An approaching car
She turns, thumb out
The car blasts by
(shouts) ,
She starts walking again
' is moving down the path
As he passes the tire swing he pushes it, setting it in motion
slings the duffle bag wearily to one side and goes into the kitchen
is under the table but  Doesn't see him
of  slowly plodding up the stairs
He comes into view, dirty and exhausted, his hair hanging in his face
He walks down the hall toward the master bedroom
The clock on the bedtable reads 2:17
falls face-first on the immaculate bedspread and lies still
In this shot we should note the closet door is standing open
,  ' Holds
Nothing for a beat
Then: small white hand slams up through the rocks, hopefully scaring the living shit out of us
as the hand begins to feel around
It takes one of the rocks and pushes it aside
Another
Another
Another
The  are not encouraging
It is  and
There is nothing human here
Rocks begin to tumble as  starts to come out of his grave
, Fast asleep on the coverlet in his dirty jeans and black sweater
My babe is still takin' a hike
But here comes another vehicle
on that snarling face
:  coming
Dead dry breath
Low snarling noises
Now we see small feet in dirty black shoes walking down the deadfall
Suddenly, as the lights appear, she does a Claudette Colbert, pulling her skirt up and exhibiting a very lovely leg
Lights--it's an Orinco truck, naturally--spotlight her
The truck stops
The driver leans over and opens the door
Hop in, baby
Thank you
She does

think he loves dead, hates living

, as those gritting footsteps approach
Then we pan to the closet
On the floor is ' little black bag
We hold on this as the footfalls near
small white hand enters the frame and pulls the doctor-bag out of the closet
Now another hand enters the frame and opens the bag
The hands search around inside and bring out a scalpel
They hold it up
The - makes a contented

Lady,  got nine points on my license right now

It's just that-- She looks at him, pleading
The  speeds up
Thank you
If you only understood how important this is-- That's all right, babe
Only if we get stopped, next time 'll be the one hitchin' and you can give me a ride
, More deeply asleep than ever
Suddenly, from inside, comes the sound of Quiet Riot singing/screaming "Bang Your Head
" It's the stereo, and boy, is it cranked
straightens up so suddenly he almost falls off his chair
His hands go first to his earphones--his first thought on waking is that it's coming from there--and then he hurries inside
to small muddy tracks on the porch floor
, He hurries in, turns on the light, and rushes across to his stereo system, which is state-of-the-art digital--it looks like a flying saucer among the more traditional furnishings of the room
He shuts it off and looks around, frowning
: Todd Rundgren, singing "Bang on the Drum All Day" at the top of his voice
' head snaps toward the
, as  hurries across the kitchen to the counter, where the radio is
He turns it off, looking around, more bewildered than ever
(sharply) Who's here
He walks toward the door which gives on the hall
, It's dimly lit by light-spill from the living room and kitchen
Come on, stop playing games
: Molly Hatchet, "Flirtin' with Disaster," being played top end, from upstairs
hurries up
Let me suggest that there is a certain psychology at work here--for the moment he's more concerned about waking the neighborhood with all this high-decible rock and roll than with the prowler
and he would certainly know who--or what--that prowler was, if he had time to think
' He enters and turns on the light
We see a portable phonograph with the record, turning
rushes over and turns it off
He looks around, and we see by his face that he knows
Gage
(Pause) Are you the one playing games
He goes to the window and looks out at: /
,    , ' , He turns slowly and walks toward the bed
Gage
Come on out
He reaches in his pocket and brings out a pocket-knife
He unfolds the blade
want to show you something
: Miaow
,  , ' , (to the cat) How did you--
' small hand holding a scalpel shoots out from beneath the skirt of the coverlet and slashes ' calf, He screams with pain and staggers backward
' The other hand shoots out
grabs one of ' ankles and pulls
With a startled yell, he falls
This one's gotta be pretty rough
George will know what to do
We finally see , but it should be clear to us that it's not really  at all
Some daemonic presence is riding inside the mouldering, disfigured shell of
There is a struggle

Perhaps he gets  a time or two with the pocketknife

sits on top of him
and then bites into his throat
9, Headlights
' truck has arrived
It pulls up
opens the passenger door, which is on ' side
We can see  sitting in the passenger seat where  just was
Thank you so much
didn't get a ticket, so you're welcome, lady
(And, more seriously) Whatever your problems are,  hope they work out
It's the end of the line for me, too--'m not allowed any further
(to the trucker) 'm sure things will be fine
'm not
She closes the door and steps down
The truck starts off with a
As it pulls past her,  starts across the road, when: (soft voice) Mummy
She stops, startled
Her face wears a "did  hear that
" expression
She looks back toward ' house
(soft voice) Mummy
walks halfway up ' paved walk and looks at: ' , ' The one place in the whole world we do not want  to go
She goes
Up the steps to the porch
All through this she's been travelling with two bags: her handbag and a light tote with her initials on it
Now she sets the tote down on the top step and opens the porch door
She looks very uncertain
This is the wee hours of the morning, and someone else's house
But
that voice
(voice) Mummy,  need you
looks stunned--rocked
She steps onto the porch
Who-- The door to the house swings open
After a moment  comes into the doorway and sits down
Miaow
Church
(voice) Mummy,  need you
She crosses to the open door
Gage
Gage
No answer
steps in
, He's restless, having a very bad dream, from the look
He rolls back and forth
Closer and closer to the edge
Finally, with a wild yell, he goes over onto the floor
, He comes awake
Sits up
Ouch
He's aches from top to bottom and side to side
but his back is worst
His hands go to it
Jesus
He starts to get up very slowly, and this his eyes fix on: '     , ' They enter the house, go to the closet, then leave again
Gage--
He scrambles for the closet, his aches and pains forgotten
He stares in wildly
- It's open
He pulls the doctor-bag out
His original hope is now tempered with the first signs of fear
He begins to go through the doctor- bag
Suddenly he brings out a case and opens it
The case is empty, but the indented shape is clear
There was a scalpel in this case
but not anymore
Oh my God
(Pause) Gage
, Gage
stands there, tensely listening, for a moment or two, but there's only silence
He rushes down the hallway and opens the door to ' room
' , ' Empty
, He goes downstairs, yelling ' name
, Nothing
The phone
almost jumps out of his skin reaching for it
Hello
(voice) Hello, Louis--it's Irwin
just wanted to be sure Rachel got back all right
As  says this, ' eyes fix upon something
,     -, ' One set comes in from the shed-garage and heads for the parlor and upstairs
The other comes out of the parlor and crosses to the kitchen door giving directly on the outside
, In his eyes we suddenly see that he understands everything
or almost everything
(voice) Louis
are you there
(slowly) Yes--'m here
(voice) Did she get there all right
Yes, she's fine
(voice) Well, put her on at that end and 'll put Ellie on at this one
Ellie's very worried about her mother
(Pause) She's almost in hysterics
She
Rachel's asleep
(an edge in his voice now) Then  suggest you wake her up
Ellie
think she had a dream that her mother was dead
'll call you right back
(voice) Louis--
But , whose last few responses have been almost trancelike, hangs up
He looks at the tracks, then goes into the parlor
, Tiny bloody hands lift it off the cradle
tiny bloody finger dials
The phone starts to ring
After two or three ringy-dingys, , looking extremely upset, comes out of the parlor and picks it up
Irwin, you'll just have to-- (voice) 'm at Jud's, daddy
Will you come over and play with me
is dumbfounded
slack-mouthed with terror
(a bare whisper) Gage
(voice) Mommy already came
We played, daddy
First  played with Jud and then mommy came and  played with mommy
We had an awful good time
Now  want to play with you
begins to giggle
a really awful sound
What did you do
What did you-- The - hangs up, still giggling
, He puts the doctor-bag down on the bed and roots through it
He comes up with three syringes, still wrapped in paper, and puts them aside
Then he roots around some more and comes up with several ampoules
He holds one up for inspection and we can read the word  on it very clearly
, He carries the syringes and ampoules of morphine over to the window
His hair has gone partially white
He fills all three syringes with morphine (using two ampoules for each syringe--i
e
, enough to kill a polar bear) and puts them in the left breast pocket of his shirt
He puts the spare ampoules in the right breast pocket of his shirt
is slowly going insane
What remains of his rationality is like a rapidly fraying rope
What you buy is what you own, and sooner or later what you own comes home to you
Wasn't that what you said, Jud
Wasn't that pretty much it
He leaves the room
comes out the door
In one hand he's got a raw pork chop
In the other he is carrying a pair of Playtex rubber gloves
He walks to the soft shoulder and waits for an Orinco truck to pass
Then he crosses
, He walks most of the way to the house, then stops
, " He gets up, humping his back warily
Hi, Church
Want some grub
He tosses the pork chop onto the grass
He hurries down the steps, goes to the chop, sniffs it, and starts to chow up
He looks up at: He is pulling on the rubber gloves
Don't mind me
Eat it while you can
Eat all you want
He starts worrying the chop again
Smack-smack-smack
Eat all you can
all you want
that's right
today's Thanksgiving day for cats, but only if they came back from the dead
He finishes with the gloves, gets one of the loaded syringes out of his breast pocket, holds it up, squirts a drop out of the tip, then moves toward
looks up
stops moving
starts eating again, and  starts moving again as soon as he does
All the time he talks to the cat in that soothing voice
He bends down
and grabs him
begins to squall and fight
holds onto him
He tries to get the syringe into the cat and  almost gets away
No, you don't
, The syringe plunges into his haunch
The needle is still dangling out of ' haunch
The cat looks dazed
It tries to walk and falls over on its side
It tries to get up
and then falls over again
Go on
Lie down
Play dead
Be dead
He walks to the porch steps and picks up the tote-bag
-, ' Any doubt he might have allowed himself the luxury of having is erased by the initials--
, same as the cola
Twang
One of the few remaining strands of sanity has now parted
He looks back at: ,   , ' Dead
He climbs the steps and goes onto the porch
, He strips off the rubber gloves
He tosses them onto the table beside ' beer-cans as he goes inside
, It's dark in here, and spooky
Rachel
(Pause) Jud
(Longer pause) Gage
No answer
He looks down and sees: , ' One of ' shoes
It lies by the foot of the stairs
He goes over and picks up the shoe
It's a three-quarter heel, and it's pretty badly scuffed
, after all, did some pretty hard travelling to get here
There's a spot of blood on it
:  low giggle
looks up: , ' Mighty dark
Mighty shadowy
: Another giggle
, Gage
(voice) Let's play, daddy
Let's play hide and go seek
He takes one of the loaded syringes from his pocket
All right, Gage
let's
He begins to climb the stairs
, arrives on the landing
We begin the nerve-wracking business of checking rooms
First, the bathroom
and the shower curtain is of course pulled
yanks it back
Nothing
He checks the linen closet
Nothing
Goes back to the hall
Looks down it
He walks slowly along it
He checks one room
It's a guest room
Shadowy and empty
Down the hall
closet door
bag falls off the top shelf, and a bunch of ceramics inside it
flinches back
Down the hall
Now he's at ' room
He goes in
' , He checks the closet
No go
He steps around the bed and sees: , ' bloodstain
He gets down on his hands and knees and examines the bloodstain
He sees the skirt on the bedspread
He lifts it
He is nose to nose with , who is dead with his eyes open, an expression of incredible horror on his face
The
bolts to his feet as  fade down the hall
Slowly, he kneels down and speaks to the skirt of the spread, which has mercifully fallen back into place
'm sorry, Jud
'm so sorry
'm-- There's a ,
turns around
He gets up again
He starts for the door
Then he turns back and speaks to  again
'm going to set things back in order
know just what to do
He goes out
, He takes one of the two remaining loaded syringes from his breast pocket
Gage
Another
And another
starts slowly forward
He gets about halfway down the hall-- and our nerves are tuned to the breaking point--when there is a and a   from overhead
This happens fast
The trap--which presumably gives on the attic with a set of folding stairs--rises, and ' body plunges down through and then hangs, swinging: she has been bound around the armpits and as become a grotesque parody of
Half her face is gone
Eaten
He  and backs against the wall
Twang
The last silver thread parts
, He leaps down, crashes on the floor, and then picks himself up
He is waving the scalpel
(screeching) Allee-allee-in-free
allee-allee- in-free
Allee-allee-in-free
won't choreograph all the moves, but  slashes his stunned father up pretty badly with the scalpel
He's screeching the whole time
finally begins to react
He grapples with the little critter, and tries to get the syringe into him
No good
It's batted out of his hand just before he can do it
It breaks
and  fall to the floor
gets the other syringe out of his pocket, but it's also knocked out of his hand
Only consolation is this one isn't broken
It rolls off along the floor
finally manages to get it again as the struggle goes on, and plunges it into ' neck
No fair
He gets to his feet, clawing for the needle lolling out of his neck
He's lost all interest in his father
He goes staggering away
He's slowing down
He goes to his knees
and falls on his face
watches this
and then his vacant, half-catatonic gaze goes to: , ' She swings slowly back and forth
Time has passed
It's late afternoon
comes out with a sheet-wrapped form in his arms
, of course
He sets the body down and goes back inside
, He's splashing around a can of coal-oil
When he's got the room wetted down to his satisfaction, he goes to the door, lights a match, and tosses it
Flame runs across the floor
The fire is slow at first, but then it begins to gain rapidly
goes out
, He picks up the sheet-wrapped form of his wife and walks around the side of the house as flames shoot through the kitchen windows
, appears with his shrouded burden and approaches the road
--- 134 --- , then rises and looks toward the house
There's one light on--in the kitchen
: Three
four
five
, is filthy, covered with dried blood
He is playing at Patience
He holds a handful of cards
: Six
seven
: The back door opens
: Crickets from outside
Ree-ree-ree
: Gritting footsteps
looks up
He doesn't look behind, at what's coming
He looks straight ahead
And what you own always comes home to you
He flips up one card
: Eight
It's the Bitch, the Queen of Spades, she who supposedly poisoned the laddies in the Tower
' hand falls upon it
: Nine
ten
, hand clotted with grave-dirt falls on his shoulder
woman's hand
: Eleven
