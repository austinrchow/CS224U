The desert hills are clearly visible in the background, with only a slight darkening to suggest day-for-night, but the car's headlights are on so we clearly understand that it is pitch black in the dead of night

They are searching for an ancient have a pitch black background and dark shadows across the car
Shirley is leaning over in her seat toward Bob, who is driving
We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery
Let's turn back
No
It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind
But does it have to be in a cemetery
You wouldn't understand
Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story
But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob
Sure there are--and 've tried them all
Plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories
Huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about-- (interrupting) But horror stories
Why all the time horror stories
Shirley,  wrote for years without selling a single word
Bob lets go of the wheel with his right arm and puts it around Shirley, who leans closer against him
My monsters have done well for me
You think 'd give that up just so  could write about trees, or dogs, or daisies
Huhuh--Daisies
That's it, 'll write about my creatures who are pushing up the daisies
Shirley looks up at Bob and smiles
He tilts his head down and they kiss
Your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing
That's life
My kisses are alive
Who's to say my monsters aren't alive
of the car driving down the road back to   of Bob and Shirley All of my books are based on fact, or legend
Thats perhaps why they're more interesting and sell in the top spots
Well, fact or not,  don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight
can't see a thing
Let's turn back
There's an old cemetery on this road
've been there before
of car driving up a desert road with a sandy mountain in the background
'm getting the jitters
Let's turn back
(reluctantly) Okay
Bob takes his arm from around Shirley and puts it back on the wheel
Just as soon as  find a place wide enough to turn around
of   -
- Bob and Shirley Not so fast
We hear sounds of tires squealing on the road
of car wheel racing along the road
- Bob and Shirley (desperately) Not so fast
-
Bob steps hard on the brake, then pumps the brake repeatedly
- Bob and Shirley
Shirley screams and hides her face with her hands
on a high dirt bank at the roadside, then the screen swirls and spins quickly to suggest a dizzying automobile crash
: - Bob and Shirley are lying on their backs, unconcsious, on the ground
The ground is covered by scattered leaves
Misty fog swirls over them
(beat) Shirley wakes up and sits upright groggily
She looks around, then looks down at Bob
She moves toward him and cradles his head in her lap
: - Cemetery is filled with fog
We see a large stone throne framed by ornate columns, with an altar beneath it
There are tombstones in the background, and skulls and bones on the ground
across a small clearing to the
() It is said on clear nights, beneath	the cold light of the moon, howl the dog and the wolf, and creeping things crawl out of the slime
It is then the ghouls feast in all their radiance
The Mausoleum doors creak open on their own, and Criswell quickly stalks out across the clearing, hiding his face behind his long black cape which is held up with his bent elbow against his face, in Dracula fashion
( - Continuing) It is on nights like this most people prefer to steer clear of, uh, Burial Grounds It is on nights like this, that the creatures are said to appear, and to walk : , Criswell walks up the steps to the altar, across the altar, and then sits down on the stone seat
He then slowly lowers his cape from his face and regally looks off to the right (at his cue card)
The day is gone, the night is upon us, and the moon, which controls all of the underworld, once again shines
in radiant contentment
(beat) Come forth, come forth, o Princess of Darkness
Criswell repeatedly beckons slowly toward himself with his right hand, staring across the clearing at the mausoleum
The    is standing in front of the Mausoleum
She walks into the clearing with an entrancing demeanor, her arms outstretched straight in front of her
She is wearing a long black low-cut dress with long open sleeves
The sleeves are lined with red and hang down a couple feet from her wrists
She walks slowly over toward Criswell's throne
The Princess of Darkness stands beside Criswells throne, crosses her forearms in front of her chest, and bows toward him
He nods toward her
She reaches out and places her left hand on Criswell's right hand
() Time seems to stand still
Not so the ghouls, when a night of Pleasure is at hand
Criswell continues to hold the Princess of Darkness's hand, and she looks at him seductively
If  am not pleased by tonight's entertainment,  shall banish their souls to everlasting damnation
The Princess of Darkness again crosses her arms in front of her chest and slowly bows to Criswell
shot of the   with dramatic cymbals crashing, then back
And who is to be first
The Princess of Darkness claps twice, summoning the first of the night's entertainers
These poor souls must dance for Criswell's approval
If he is pleased, they can continue to entertain him for centuries, but if not, they will be banished to everlasting damnation by the All-powerful Criswell
Huge flames rise from the ground in front of the clearing
The   enters the clearing and begins to Dance
She is wearing a red Native American- style dress and headband
One who loved flames
Her lover was killed by flames
She died in flames
The    begins
The Indian Girl dances around for awhile, then dances away into the foggy background
- Bob slowly wakes up and sits up
Bob and Shirley look around
- The Princess of Darkness points dramatically toward the mausoleum and begins to speak without moving her lips marvel of filmmaking art
(out of sync with picture) One who prowls the lonely streets at night in life is bound to prowl them in eternity
The    begins
The   walks into the clearing wearing a pink dress and purple feather boa, and beckons with her finger as if to say, "Come here, Criswell
" At the car accident scene with Bob and Shirley, slow jazz music is audible from the nearby festivities in the cemetery
Bob and Shirley are still sitting on the ground, looking toward the source of the music
() Ahh, the curiousity of youth
on the road to ruin
May it ever be so adventurous
'm so frightened
Well we certainly can't stay here
'mon
Where
In there
It frightens me
Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of
Then
then what's that music
That's what  want to find out
We have to get help
What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night
Something's making that music
'm not sure  care to find out what it is
All right
Don't worry, 'll be right beside you
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead
Not dead
In a cemetery
can't imagine anything dead playing that music
Well, it's probably just the caretaker, and that's exactly who we want to find
They'll have a telephone
'mon
Bob helps Shirley up from the ground and leads her into the thick bushes
, Criswell nods repeatedly, smiling at the dancer in approval
The Street Walker's clothes have suddenly disappeared
Bob and Shirley creep beneath the bushes, crouched down low
They reach the edge of the clearing where Criswell and the Princess of Darkness are watching the Street Walker Dance
Could it be some kind of college initiation
It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and  know them
Nothing alive looks like that
Can't we get out of here
'm not sure
What do you mean
'm not sure, myself
It's just a feeling 've had since the crash
Like feel a cold chill all over
Now this
The Street Walker dances with a Skeleton that is hanging by the door of the mausoleum
The Street Walker dance ends
would see for approval, the one who in life worshipped gold above all else
The Princess of Darkness points dramatically toward the mausoleum again to start off the next dance
The giants walk to the doors, now wearing red and white horizontal-striped miniskirts (or ancient egyptian garb
)
They pull the iron doors open slowly, and we see the lying on her back on the altar inside
(pointing toward the mausoleum) Look
Be careful
--They'll see you
The Gold Girl Dancer rises slowly and seductively from the table, then stalkingly dances out into the clearing
She is wearing a metallic gold tunic-like dress
We see a shot of Bob and Shirley watching, and suddenly the Gold Girl's dress has disappeared
The Gold Girl Dance continues
Throw gold at her
The giants pick up a bucket of gold doubloons and begin slowly sprinkling them over the Gold Girl as she dances
She sits on the ground and reaches for the falling coins
More gold
The giants continue dropping gold coins on the Gold Girl
She picks up the gold coins, rubbing them over her body, in ecstasy
(excitedly) More gold
The giants continue, to the delight of Criswell
The Gold girl tries to scoop all the scattered coins closer to her
(impatiently) More gold
The giants continue
Criswell is thrilled, and begins to loudly
(to the Princess) For all eternity, she shall have gold
The Princess of Darkness laughs in acknowledgement, then claps her hands twice, commanding the Giants to finish the ceremony
The Giants walk toward the Gold Girl, who is still on the ground playing with the gold coins and rubbing them on her body
The giants pick up the Gold Girl, who resists, trying to maintain contact with the gold
She reaches for it as they lift her up
of a    full of a substance that is supposed to look like gold
The Giants dip the Gold Girl feet first into the cauldron, submerging her entire body
few seconds later, the giants lift the Gold Girl out of the cauldron
Her body is now entirely gilded, and she is stiff
They lift her onto their shoulders, carrying her like a board, walking in front of Criswell's throne, then back into the mausoleum, laying her body on the altar
We see Bob and Shirley, looking dismayed
() And both couldn't help but remember a line from one of Bob's stories:  " sudden wind howls
The night things are all about me
Every shadow, a beckoning invitation
to disaster
know  should think of other things, of pleasant things, but  can't
How can  think of other things, of pleasant things, when  am in a place surrounded by shadows and objects, which can take any shape, here in the darkness
Any shape my mind can conceive
" Deep in the woods, we see    and  , walking quickly
Suddenly, Bob and Shirley are grabbed from behind by the and the
The Wolf Man and The Mummy drag Bob and Shirley over to the clearing near Criswell's throne
The Princess of Darkness is now seated at Criswell's right side with him on his throne
Bring 'em in
The Princess of Darkness stands and walks to the end of the altar below Criswell's throne, then sits on the lower seat at the end of the altar and crosses her legs
The Wolf Man and The Mummy drag Bob and Shirley over to the center of the clearing to face Criswell, The Sole Ruler of the Dark World
They are live ones
(with audible tape hiss added) Yes, Master
Live ones where only the dead should be
Yes, Master, and we caught them, him and me
The Mummy motions toward the Wolf Man
You shall both be rewarded
(To Princess) My Dear Empress of the Night, put these intruders to the test
Medium Shot of Princess of Darkness
(Suddenly the Princess of  Darkness is beside the throne again, several feet from the seat at the foot of the altar) But they are not yet one of us
(happily) situation easily remedied
Tie them that they may watch
back to long shot of the entire throne and throne altar
The Princess of	Darkness is now seated again at the end of the altar
The Wolf Man and The Mummy tie Bob and Shirley to very tall grave stones
to medium-close shot of Princess of Darkness, whose chest is heaving excitedly as she grips the handle of the long sacrificial dagger tucked into the belt at her waist
(desperately, to Criswell) Fiend
Fiend
To love the cat, is to be the cat
Criswell motions toward The Princess of Darkness, who then walks back up onto the altar and then sits down beside Criswell again
The    begins
(jovially) pussycat is born to be whipped
The Cat Girl Dance ends
(excitedly) It will please me very much to see the Slave Girl with her tortures
interior of the stone mausoleum
The Ancient Egyptian is chained from her wrists to a high hook on the wall
One of the "giants" pretends to whip her with a cat o' nine tails
back to
(excitedly) Torture
Torture
It pleasures me
The slave girl pulls with all her might and the chains suddenly pop off the hook
She then pushes the iron doors open and dances out into the clearing
The Slave Dance concludes
'm so frightened
You've got a right to be
We're trapped by a bunch of fiends
Those creatures
Don't let them hear you
What can we do
don't know
just don't know
But don't give up
We're not finished yet
Shirley closes her eyes and sighs
Easy Shirley, Easy
Panic won't do us any good
Let me think
We've got to stall for time
'm afraid 'll faint
Whatever you do, don't do that
The Camera zooms back and we see that the Wolf Man and The Mummy are hiding behind Bob and Shirley
The Wolf Man has his hand up to his ear so he can hear what Bob and Shirley are saying
The Wolf Man and The Mummy then creep over toward Criswell's throne
The Wolf Man whispers into The Princess of Darkness's ear while The Mummy and Criswell watch
The Princess of Darkness gets up from the throne and walks over to Shirley
Shirley grimaces
The Princess of Darkness unbuttons Shirley's blouse, then marks Shirley's abdomen with a red (blood
) cross using her long sharp fingernail
Shirley screams
The Princess of Darkness pulls her long dagger out of her belt and raises it, staring into Shirley's eyes
Suddenly, Criswell yells: The Princess of Darkness pauses and looks back at Criswell
Let her continue to learn
The time is not yet right that they should join with us
The Princess of Darkness reluctantly puts her dagger back in her belt and tucks Shirley's blouse back in
The Princess of Darkness walks back to Criswell's throne
He pulls a human skull out from behind his seat
And what is this
symbol, Master
What kind of symbol
She loved the bull ring and the matador
She danced to their destruction
Now she dances to her own destruction
Her dance is of skulls
The Princess of Darkness takes the skull from Criswell and throws it dramatically into the clearing
The   ( ) ensues
She came to us on the Day of the Dead
El Dia De Los Muertos celebration in her country
Her dance has pleased me
The Princess of Darkness snaps her fingers, starting the ( )
With the loss of her lover, this one cast herself into the Volcano's fire
couple times during the dance, there are abrupt cuts to of a rattlesnake in a bright daylight shot in tall dry grass
(Looks like it was from a documentary) She was
As  said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames
Oh, yes, a religion of sorts
It would seem so, Master
Hawaiian Dance continues, then cut to The Mummy and The Wolf Man
don't like snakes
remember the one Cleopatra used
Cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue, and those two sharp fangs
You'd never think such a little thing packed such a big wallop
Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh
Hurt her
Hell, it killed her
(in agreement) Aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn
Hawaiian/Snake Girl continues to dance
We had lots of snakes in my ancient Egypt
slimy, slinky things
Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn
AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
When  was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of
Aaarrrgggaahh
The Hawaiian Dance ends
She pleases me
Permit her to live in the World of the Snakes
(audible cue card flip) (continuing, after finding his place on the next cue card) Now,  will talk
to The Wolf Man
and The Mummy
As you wish, Master The Princess of Darkness motions for The Wolf Man and The Mummy to come
He wants us
Aaahhnnnahnnnn
What do you suppose for
Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh
Did you do something to get us into trouble again
Aannnnaahhnn
Did you howl off-key at the moon again
Aannnnaahhnn
can't remember doing anything wrong either
We better go before we make him mad
The Wolf Man and The Mummy walk over to Criswell's Throne
(apprehensively) We are your servants, Master
The Wolf Man bows to Criswell
Of course you are
The Wolf Man and the Mummy crouch in fear as they face Criswell
Have we in some way made you angry, Master
You know better than that
We don't know of anything, Master
Then why do you shake so
It's not often an Emperor like you calls on creatures like us
Well rest easy, 'm not angry with either of you
(relieved) Aaaahhhh
The Mummy Sighs in relief and the Wolf Man nods
Then it is some service you desire of us
You are the keepers of the Damned
You two know them all
And  am tired of this usual type of entertainment
want
a decided change
The moon
is soon gone
The Princess of Darkness points up at the full moon
There is little time left for the remainder of the evening's pleasures
The Princess of Darkness gets up from the seat at the end of the altar and walks around beside Criswell's throne
Yes, yes yes  know all that
At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone
suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon
It would seem so, Master Ahh, but  declare there is still time for some thing
There are one or two which should complement the night's entertainment, Master Ahh, good
Then  will see them
Dismiss the rest
Yes, sir, Master
Bob's hands are wiggling, trying to loosen the rope binding his wrists behind his back around the stone column
The ropes are coming loose
Be careful
am--It's our only chance
Nothing is worth your life
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway
'm frightened
'm so frightened
Hold on just a little longer, Shirley
Be careful, oh please be careful
We'll never get out of here alive,  know it
just feel it
You do
Yes  feel it in my bones
You're talking nonsense
Oh, no 'm not
These heathens probably have an open grave for us
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- or would they
should hope not hate you
That sudden
Yes, that sudden
If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this
It's all your fault
(dejected) And  thought you loved me
The Princess of Darkness is leaning over, covering her mouth and whispering into Criswell's ear, looking over her hand back at Shirley
Not yet
perhaps have other plans for such a pretty one
No matter,  will tell you when and if you may have her
The Princess of Darkness crosses her forearms and bows to Criswell
The Wolf Man informs me that the next one is the woman who murdered her husband on their wedding night
Now she dances with his skeleton
The   begins
The   , wearing a white dress and long wedding veil, comes into the clearing with a skeleton
She dances with the skeleton, then dances in the clearing for Criswell
The Skeleton Dance concludes
(to Shirley) Have you not enjoyed the evening's festivities
Shirley is silent and looks downward
Ahh, that will soon change when you become one of us
The Wolf Man leans back and howls
(He tilts his head back so far his fake rubber wolfman mask comes up and you can see his skin at the bottom of his neck) - AAAAAAAAAHHGGGGGHHHHHHHhhhhhh
It would seem that The Wolf Man would have you for his own
have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward
It could be that you are that reward
You need not worry
Not just now, anyway
Leave her alone, you fiend
Fiend is it
You will not be so fortunate
Your existence will cease within moments
No one wishes to see a man dance
(looking at Shirley) And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come
If  could get my hands on you
Oh, You could do nothing
(to Shirley) can save you much pain
Leave her alone,  tell you
(to Shirley) do not joke in my proposal
She is to be mine
It is so spoken
The Princess of Darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain
(beat) Yet  am inclined for one as lovely as you, to be more lenient
have but to touch you with my finger, and it would mean the end of you, all over, quickly and painlessly
No
No
No
repulse you
Very well
It seems you have chosen your own fate
Live with it
should say die with it
Bob looks down somberly, then looks over at Shirley
've got the ropes loose now
've got my hands free
Be careful--Don't change your expression too much
They must not catch on
What can we do against them
don't know, yet
We'll just have to watch our chance
When it comes 'll know what to do-- hope 'll know what to do
still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you
All right
Put it on heavy
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this
At least he's got brains
Him
'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on
Maybe so
shot of The Mummy talking to The Wolf Man could make her another Cleopatra
Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn
Without the snake, of course
(impatiently) Well
Ahh, she will be yours
(impatiently) When
At your discretion
But first,  desire more entertainment
The moon is almost gone
Ahh, there is yet time
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light
(getting annoyed) know the laws of the night
state there is still time for yet another
(forcefully) would have time for my own pleasures
(angrily) Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when  desire it
am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World
There is no one to challenge my authority here
My word is the law--all powerful
No one is to challenge that authority, no one
Is that understood
It is my command
understand, Master Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair
Now are there others
There are others
Well then let us proceed
The Princess of Darkness snaps her fingers three times, summoning the Zombie Dance Girl
She lived as a zombie in life, so she will remain forever a zombie in death
The    dances
Easy, Shirley
Easy
The Zombie Dance concludes
The moon sinks lower into the hills
We must hurry to the finish
will decide the conclusion
(impatiently) You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session
(interrupting) Then cancel my order
The moon is almost gone
There is yet time
Don't you want your own pleasure
Oh, if there is only time
Hahh, there is always time
All in good time
there is always time
You shall have your pleasure
decree (looking at Shirley) All others were but infinitessimal bits of fluff, compared to her (toward the Dancer) This one would have died for feathers, furs, and fluff
and so she did
The   Girl dances for approval
The Fluff Dance ends
Criswell looks over at the Princess of Darkness
The time
is short
For what
Your pleasures of course
You mean
You may take her now
Is there time
You better hope there is
Thank you, Master
Thank you
Now hurry, hurry
will watch
Your desires may be my pleasure also
Our fitting climax to an evening's enter- tainment
You must
hurry now
The Princess of Darkness begins ceremoniously dancing with her long sacrificial dagger, slowly moving toward shirley, gazing back at Criswell seductively
She finally gets to Shirley and cuts the button off of Shirley's shirt, which was so tight it was about to burst open anyway
She unsnaps the front of Shirley's bra
Bob sees his chance and makes his attempt at a "move," merely stepping forward
He is instantly hammer-fisted on the back of the neck by The Wolf Man, and falls down unconscious
The Princess of Darkness raises her long dagger high above Shirley's head
But suddenly, the sun rises (it is already high overhead), and the night creatures lose their power
The Princess of Darkness clings to Shirley's arm, as she slowly sinks down to the ground, losing all strength
The Camera pans around, showing Shirley and Bob's faces, then back to the ghouls, all of whom have turned to steaming skeletons
Only their clothing and bones remain
Quick Zoom in on Criswell's throne
Criswell's steaming skeleton still sits, surveying the cemetery, wearing his cape
- At the clearing in the woods near the car wreck, Bob and Shirley are lying on their backs on the ground, just as they were after the crash, before they got up to investigate the strange music that led them to the ghouls
There are two  examining Bob and Shirley
In the foreground, we see a 's shoulder and hands
He is writing down details of the accident in a small paper pad
#1 Easy, Miss, everything's gonna be alright
Bob
Bob
#1 He's right here beside you
He'll be alright too
The reporter walks around and crouches beside Shirley and #1, and continues writing in his pad
Newspaper  crouches in the foreground to get a shot of the accident scene and victims
Where are they, where did they go
They tried to kill me
#2 What's this you say
Who was going to kill you
The ghouls--they all turned into skeletons
#2 Take it easy, Miss
#1 What she needs is a good rest
It's true,  tell you, it's true
They all turned into skeletons
She-she cut me here
Shirley points to her abdomen where The Princess of Darkness had made the  with her fingernail
crouches down and pulls out a length of medical tape, then hands it to the doctor
She cuts another piece of tape, but the Doctors don't realize this and leave her hanging
#1 Probably was bruised in the crash
#2 You know, you two were very lucky
love you Bob
really do
Forgive me
There's nothing to forgive
It was all a dream
You love me then
Of course  do
The doctors put Shirley onto a stretcher while the photographer takes more pictures
They put her into the back of an ambulance
Then after the doctor listens to Bob's neck with a stethoscope, Bob just gets up and walks into the back of the ambulance
() As it is with all the Night People, they are destroyed by the first rays of the sun
But upon the first appearance of the deep shadows of the night, and when the moon is full, they will return, to rejoice
in their evil lust, and take back with them any mortal who might happen along
: ,
Criswell is back in his coffin, sitting upright
Yes, they were lucky, those two young people
May you be so lucky
But do not trust to luck, at the full of the moon, when the night is dark
Make a wide path around the unholy grounds
of the Night People
Who can say that we do not exist-Can you
But now, we return to our graves, and you (pointing at audience) may join us soon
Criswell reclines back into his coffin, crossing his arms, and returning to the slumber of the undead
