The street-lights are a joke - three out of four are dead
Only a large moon and some cloud-streaked stars illuminate this dark and derelict street
Once the hub of an industrial area, now the buildings are abandoned, the sidewalks choked with litter and debris
Stores are boarded-up, windows are glassless, walls are graffitied
At various points, several  warm their hands at trash-can fires
- as their eyes move, following something moving down the street
Heard  is the sound of a smooth and powerful engine
Down this boulevard of decay and despair drives an incongruously expensive car - a Range Rover
rich kid is going shopping
The car cruises the ruins until it pulls up outside the only open store on the block
dim light bulb shines within - the only indicator that the store is still trading
Its windows are grimy, its door defaced
Above the door - barely legible through the accrued dirt of city years - a sign; '
The side door opens - helped on its way by the kick of an expensive leather boot - and   steps out
is 24, rich, handsome, and spoiled
His hair is slick with designer-grease, his slim frame is wrapped in a $600 leather jacket
For a moment he surveys the store and casts contemptuous glances up and down the ruined street
He shows no anxiety at being in this twilight part of town
Cocooned in the confidence of wealth, he's never felt threatened in his life
Satisfied he's in the right place, he walks confidently through the doorway
' The store itself looks like an antique - old wood panelling and shelving, Victorian display cases, and faded wallpaper
It is grimy, dusty, and dimly-lit - and apparently unattended
It is packed with merchandise - shelves and aisles overflow onto the floor making the place a maze to walk through
The stock is a strange surreal mix
Discarded items from 50's America (Norge fridges, toasters, Frankie Lymon albums) share space with older items; framed pictures, Victorian automata, wax dolls, and (a specialty of the store
) items of punishment; stocks, iron boots, chastity belts, whips
Could that really be an Electric Chair glimpsed in the shadowed back of the room
He wanders through the merchandise, casting appraising glances at some items
Some he even runs his hands over - grimacing at the dust and grime they leave on his fingers
But his manner suggests he is looking for something specific
Near the room's center is an old hoarding from the dead days of vaudeville and travelling shows
It is tall and broad and is leaning against something behind it
- which is colorfully and garishly decorated and full of hyperbolic come-ons to long-dead punters: '
, - as he moves the hoarding aside
Wow
is a six-foot tall black rectangular pillar, covered in beautifully detailed 3- carvings all in the same matt-black finish as the pillar itself
The pillar is extremely bizarre, as if a New York avant-garde sculptor has interpreted a Totem Pole for jaded modern tastes
The carvings are of dead rats, copulating skeletons,  filigree-patterned boxes, and faces
One of these faces - recognizable to the audience but not to - is the ossified visage of , the demon from the first two  pictures
- as he leans in to study this face, already fascinated by its calm cruelty and promise of dark wisdom
voice  startles him
You want it
whirls round in shock
is standing close to him
He has long matted black hair and a similarly greasy beard
His eyes are a piercing, excited blue
Otherwise he is indistinguishable from those we saw on the street outside ragged, tatty clothes, features blackened with grime
- as he glances round the store and past the bum to the door beyond; has this character just wandered in from the street
Is it yours
The Bum smiles, shaking his head knowingly
No
Not mine
Yours
nods, still a little uncertain
How much do you want for it
Whatever you think its worth
digs a hand into his back pocket and pulls out a wad of cash
Without counting or checking, he proffers it
The Bum's hand flies out and siezes 's, pressing the money between their palms, making the exchange into a handclasp
In the background,   , is Pinhead's face on the pillar
() Enjoy
The  switches so that the hands in foreground  and Pinhead's frozen face becomes , as if he is silently watching this deal take place
The Bum's hand moves away with the money as we Voice
It's a mystery to me
- to full-frame   image of , standing and looking directly into camera, as if we are watching a  broadcast
In shot behind her is a quiet hospital Emergency Room - no patients, no staff, just beds and intensive-care equipment
Joanne - or , as she prefers to be called - is 23 years old, an attractive and clever brunette, with a quiet sadness in her eyes that she usually manages to keep almost hidden
Dressed in the stylish but sedate garb of a  newsperson, she holds a microphone marked with the logo of her station, -
Her direct address to the unseen  camera continues
Most nights this inner-city Emergency Room would be a chaos of blood and panic and grace under pressure
But tonight, as you see, it's like Death took a holiday
It's a mystery to me mystery how those assholes at Assignments knew it
This is Joey Summerskill for -
Emergency Room
No story
Really, really pissed off
Despite the nature of her last few words, Joey has ironically kept up the manner and delivery of a newscaster
Now, she breaks mood, looks away from the camera, and, with a dismissive wave of the hand, begins to walk out of shot
Ah, break it down, Doc
It's a bust
- to reveal that we are not watching a broadcast at all but are in the  in real time
As well as Joey, the room contains her cameraman ("" ) and an
Doc - a 45 year old with a weight problem, a nicotine addiction, and a cynical attitude - lowers a shoulder-mounted Video camera and watches Joey walk to a water-cooler against a wall
His expression is a mix of exasperation and sympathy
The Nurse is a middle-aged woman of Asian ancestry
She has a puzzled expression as she addresses Doc
She can talk like this on television
She can say this thing
This assholes
Doc replies but keeps his eyes on Joey as he crosses to her
No sweat, sweetheart
It's for the European satellite
Joey; rein it in, kid
They couldn't've known
Joey sucks angrily at water from a paper-cup and then crushes and bins the cup like an act of revenge
know
know
But it's just so
neat, isn't it
The first gig that isn't cute kids or diet gurus and it's taken away from me
Yeah, well like you said - it's a mystery
But that's all it is
Mystery
Not malice
What, you think the station paid off every accident victim in the city to
Doc is interrupted by the  of a cell-phone he has holstered at his waist
He picks it up
Speak
Doc
24th and Cedar
Fast
Hostage situation
Listen - Joey's here
Shall
No need
Martin's already there
Hurry
You've got ambulances to beat
The line goes dead
Doc looks at Joey
She heard it all
He shrugs apologetically
Better hurry, Doc
real story
With a real reporter
Joey
Look, you wanna ride
can go by your place
You'd lose the money-shots
No
'll catch a bus
Or a cab
Don't worry about it
Go
Be careful
And lighten up
Story of your life could be right round the corner
That is the story of my life
With a rueful smile, Joey watches Doc leave
Joey and the Nurse exchange glances - Joey's impassive but vaguely friendly, the Nurse's a little disapproving; if the camera's gone, what the hell are  still doing here
Joey makes her solitary way along a medium-length corridor that has two sets of double swing doors at either end, one set giving on to the , the other toward an exit
Joey is heading for the latter, her mood sad and defeated
Suddenly -
- the doors burst open from the other side
The mood is suddenly fast and urgent as a gurney is wheeled rapidly through the doors
Two , both male, both about Joey's age, are pushing the gurney at a run and talking rapidly to each other
They completely ignore Joey and also ignore the   who is running beside the gurney
The girl -  - is 18 or 19
She is a pale-faced blonde dressed as if for a Desperately-Seeking-Susan party and is keeping up a stream of chatter as if rehearsing excuses
As Joey flattens herself against the corridor wall to let them pass, it is neither the paramedics nor Terri that get her attention
It is the  on the gurney
/ The teenage boy lies flat on his back semi-conscious, his eyelids fluttering, his breathing shallow
Horribly, shockingly, dangling from his face and body are long, heavy chains that drag and rattle along the corridor floor
There are at least sixteen of them and they seem firmly buried in his skin
The  as the gurney is rushed to the  doors is - and , the Paramedics responding only to each other and ignoring the two girls comments and questions
It wasn't my fault
It wasn't my fault
1 10 milligram  Valium stat
How the fuck did this happen
It was outside
wasn't even with him
2 You ever see anything like this before
He must have stolen it
What's going on
1 Yeah, sure
Five times a fucking day
Just push
Once the gurney has passed her, Joey runs along behind it
It was off the statue
In the club
What happened to him
2 Think they'll get him back
It's nothing to do with me
1 Worst case of status 've seen
Even money at best
The foot of the gurney slams into the  doors and the Paramedics slide it rapidly through
Wait
'm a reporter
Tell me where he was
The Nurse and a middle-aged  are seen through the doors preparing emergency equipment
The Doctor already has fibrillator pads in his hands
The Paramedics follow the gurney through and, turning rapidly, push the doors closed from the inside
Joey and Terri are alone, excluded from the  activity
Joey turns to speak but Terri is already halfway to the other doors
Joey runs after her
Hold on
Hold on, please
need talk to you
(over her shoulder) It's nothing to do with me
wasn't even with him
Joey catches up with her a couple of yards short of the doors
She grabs at her arm to slow her down
Terri turns, snatching her arm away in a sudden moment of fierce anger
She backs toward the doors, making gestures of dismissal and denial with her hands
Look, lady
told you
It's not my problem
was just there
Where
Under The Underground
Can  like now
Under the Underground
What's that
Where is
Suddenly, the conversation is interrupted by a shatteringly loud , agonized and terrified, coming from the
Both girls freeze but then their reactions are very different: Joey turns instantly and runs back toward the
Terri watches her for a beat and then heads through the other doors
The  continues, a howling horrible sound
Joey reaches the  doors and throws them open
And freezes in terrified shock
- is on the floor, as if flung there by some powerful force
The fibrillator pads are still in his hands and his expression is awe-struck and disbelieving
- is cowering behind a mobile tray of surgical instruments, muttering to herself and making the gesture of the cross
- are flattened against the far wall, terror on their faces
The Boy is on the emergency table
It's him that's screaming
His body is arched tight in shock, eyes and mouth wide open
He's wired up to an  and the  shows a heartbeat that should be measured on the Richter scale
The chains - all still connected to his face and his body  are rigid and tight, being pulled straight up into the air as if tugged taut by invisible hands
The boy's skin is stretched and pulled at those points where the chains are connected to him and it seems horribly possible that his flesh will burst if the pressure continues
10 The scene is held for a terrible frozen moment
Then suddenly the chains drop, the scream stops, and the boy's body slumps
There is a massive
The  flat-lines before it and the other monitors go haywire, sparking and spluttering
The lights in the room flicker and strobe
The fibrillator pads arc angrily
The Doctor flings them away
seems to run along the slumped chains and they disappear as if dissolved in some impossible electric meltdown
Lighting and machinery return to normal ( still flat-lining) and the medical staff stare thunder-struck at the dead boy
For the first time, the other people in the  become aware of Joey's presence in the doorway
Who's that
Get her out of here
The Nurse heads for the doors
Joey is already backing away
- as Joey backs away, an expression of numbed shock on her face
The doors close over, blocking her out
- still arcing
- - on flickering neon light in the bus cabin
- glancing at the light from her seat
'  - The bus is almost deserted
Three other passengers -  , , and   - are spread out around the interior
All seem lost in worlds of their own but their vacant alienated stares highlight Joey's isolation and tension
Fear has entered her life
11 The bus moves through the neon-lit loneliness of downtown streets
- her face, lit by reflected store-signs and street-lights, is lost and distant, as if she is submerged in some dream-sea of memory and sadness
, wall of  monitors, each monitor showing Joey sitting on a couch with a painfully thin older woman -
Brittany's probably 50 but her face is as tight and smooth as surgery can make it
She is dressed in the standard uniform of the health-avatar; brightly-colored leotard over black tights
Joey has a big paperback book -  ; - which she holds to camera
She smiles and, turning to face Brittany, crosses her legs
The image freezes
And replays
Joey crosses her legs again
And again
And again
(over) See
This is what  mean
Your technique is all wrong
Joey (in real time) is sitting in an easy chair in the editing suite looking at the wall of monitors
, a techie in his late-twenties, and   are in swivel chairs immediately in front of the video console
All three are drinking coffee
Doc is smoking a cigarette
(guardedly) What do you mean
mean hardly any thigh
'm telling you, Joey; shorter skirt, more lift on the leg-cross
and you're made
Doc chuckles in a half-friendly, half-sleazy way
Fuck you
12 What, you think 'm kidding guarantee it
An inch more flank
Boys upstairs get hot
Bingo, you're an anchor-woman
(to herself) Jesus Christ
Ah, give her a break
Doc leans over and stops the tape
(to Doc) What's with you
He swivels his chair round to face Joey
'mon, Joey
'm just trying to help you hit a home run here
Yeah
Well, you just struck out
It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but want to do it the right way
Not tight skirts
Tight stories
Right
Like last night's doozie
know what  saw
And  believe what you say
But this is No pictures, no story
Yeah, too bad  had to go and
and cover something on Planet Earth
See, you gotta remember, Joey; this is a station
As in local to this galaxy
Joey slams her coffee mug down and stands up
There's a story out there
13 (jumping in warningly) Not on station time
No
Not on station time
My story
My time
Joey exits
Brad watches her leave with a half-smile on his face then turns to Doc
Lot of attitude there, Doc
He starts up the video tape again and, on the monitors, Joey once again crosses her legs on the couch
but great legs
on a screaming male face, twisted as in pain or fury
rapidly to  the face belongs to the lead singer of
He is on a nightclub stage with the rest of the band, all of them dressed in that shit-poor-white-trash-on-dope look favored by all such rich young businessmen with guitars
tatty banner across the back of the stage proclaims: The  ends, replaced with the roaring thunder of drums and guitars as Thanatos kick into some thrash-metal
The dance-floor of the club is packed with  dancing to the incredibly fast, incredibly loud music
Many of the kids favor the same look as the band but it's not exclusive; college types are there too, along with some  male and female - sporting the glitz-meets-sleaze look of Terri
The club itself is of course dimly-lit and the basic decor is black
Where it is distinguished from hundreds of others is in the bizarre sculptures and pieces of artwork that hang from the ceiling and walls, all in tones of black, silver and gray: headless, armless torso wrapped in barbed wire
pair of male and female heads
Bonsai-like trees grow out of every orifice - eye-sockets, nostrils, ears, and mouths
14 human arm with the skin and flesh of its upper half peeled open and pinned out to reveal inside - instead of bone and sinew - an entire miniature metropolis, beautifully detailed
black bird cage containing a fetal skeleton
Kids also crowd the bar and the tables on the outskirts of the dance floor
It is a hot, sweaty, faintly aggressive atmosphere - people jostling for position, shouting to be heard, etc etc
The camera finds Joey - incongruous by dress and demeanor pushing her way among the crowd
The music is too loud and overpowering to hear Joey's voice but it is clear as she moves through the confines of the club that she is approaching various people and enquiring after Terri
- shake their heads and shrug
- stares blankly and blinks
- giggle, purse their lips, shake their heads
- catches sight of a blonde figure moving across the dance floor and pushes through the crowd to follow
She taps the figure's arm but, as it turns, she realizes it is a man  some 70's revivalist -
He looks quizzically at her
Joey's mouth moves and this time she seems to get some response
The Glitter-Rocker mouths a name
Joey can't hear him
She hands him a business card and a pen
He scrawls a name on the back of the card and Joey nods her thanks as he moves on
- as Joey reads the name "Terri" on it
She flips the card to reveal her name and number and writes "Terri - Please call
"
15 - as Joey pushes to the counter and hands the card to a who looks at it, nods, and puts it beneath the counter
- as Joey makes her way out
Camera moves into the tightly-packed throng on the dance floor, making its way slowly toward the previously unseen center
The crowd parts slightly to reveal, in the direct center of the floor, the tall black pillar from the opening sequence
The pillar is mounted on a plinth and spins as the clientele dance around it
It seems very in keeping with the decor of the club but even so it is a strong unsettling presence
The pillar has been mounted upside down, so that it looks even odder than our first glimpse of it
Near the bottom the inverted face of Pinhead, black and frozen, can be seen
The camera begins to spin around the pillar in contrary motion to the pillar's own movement and, as it does so, draws closer and closer making for a disorienting, vertiginous image
As this happens, the raucous sound of the band Thanatos begins to fade into a whirl of  and to be replaced by a whirring, spinning, sound which we only recognize fully as we (' ) The screen is filled with dense jungle foliage
The chugging spinning sound is now identifiable as the sound of Helicopter blades, one element of a   conveying the sense and feel of a Jungle War; Helicopters in flight, machine gun fire, distant explosions, confused shouts and cries
camera pushes its way through the lush, humid greenery
The camera seems to be searching for something, glancing this way and that, shoving leaves and tall grass aside
Voices begin to emerge clearly from the   off-screen as if the unseen seeker is getting nearer to his or her goal
1 (off) Call for a Medi-Vac
16 2 (off) Don't die, man
Don't fucking die
The dialogue prompts a more furious effort on the part of the camera
Pushing frantically through the obscuring foliage, it finally gains a clearer view and stops, looking ahead
In a tiny clearing, ten feet from the camera, still partially obscured by the jungle, two camouflage-clad  lean over the prone body of a third
It is unclear due to distance but there is a lot of blood on the Soldier's body and uniform
new sound joins the   - a persistent, rhythmic, ringing sound
The other elements die away until only this is left and we recognize it as the sound of a telephone as we , ' Joey jerks upright in bed as the ringing continues
Confused and disoriented, her eyes fly around her darkened bedroom as if she's trying to understand where she is and what is happening
Finally, she registers the phone and leans toward her bedside table to pick it up
- favoring the luminous display of an alarm clock next to the phone
Its warm green figures show the time is 2:35
(off
Sleepily) God
This better be birth, marriage, or death
- as she picks up the handset and puts it to her ear
Uh-huh
(on phone) Uh
Hi
Is this
er
Joanne Summerskill
Joey
Yeah, who is this
17 You like
left me a card
At the club
Right
Right
Joey swings out of bed to sit on the edge, much more alert now
Right
So
Well, what do you want
want to talk to you
We met
now, listen, don't hang up,
We met at the hospital last night
Oh yeah
Yeah
Well
Look, 'll make a deal with you
My boyfriend threw me out, right
'll trade you
You give me couch-space
'll give you talk
Joey can't resist another glance at the clock
Yeah
Sure
You mean
tonight
(Surprised at Joey's surprise
Bit of a culture clash here) Of course tonight
Is that a problem
Like, if you've got a guy there or something
No
No
It's fine
Come now
was having bad dreams anyway
, ' on the front door of the apartment as it opens to reveal Terri leaning against the doorframe
Clad identically to how we last saw her, Terri clutches a well- stuffed leather bag, containing all her worldly possessions
Hi
How're you doing
Not waiting for either reply or invitation, she moves forward
18 - as Terri walks past the dressing-gowned Joey and heads straight for Joey's sofa and sprawls on it, laying her bag on the floor beside her
You got anything to drink
Joey closes the door, raised eyebrows registering her slight disapproval at Terri's cavalier attitude
Her voice, however, is polite
put some decaf on
Er
make yourself comfortable
Right
Joey walks past Terri and through to her kitchen, from where we hear the sound of
Terri looks around at Joey's room
The large and spacious room suggests that even if Joey is dissatisfied with her job she's at least being paid enough to make it bearable
The room is very ordered, very neat, but stops short of being prissy
very large picture window takes up all of one wall
At the moment of course the drapes are closed
Another wall is taken up by a huge shelf unit packed with books, videos, and CDs
Joey's obsession with "getting the whole story" seems to be true of her personal life as well as her professional
- having finished her quick examination, she calls out
So
what was your bad dream
Joey re-enters, carrying two mugs of coffee
What
Your dream
You said you were having a bad dream
Oh yeah
19 She hands one coffee to Terri and sits opposite her
well, 've been having it for years
It's not a nightmare or anything
It's well,  know what it is
What is it
Why are you so interested
Sorry
No
No, it's
It's my father
(sympathetic, knowing) Oh, right
Did he used to
God, no
Nothing like that
No, he died before  was born
He died in Vietnam
never knew him
Never met him
We don't even know the details dream of battlefields
Of searching
Of trying to find out
That's great
What
No
mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything
It's just  don't dream
Never have
Maybe it'd help if  slept sometime
Just kidding
No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams
'm jealous
It's like everybody has another world except me
You know what  mean
know what you're saying but
Never
You've never had a dream
No, you know, you do
You must
What you mean is you don't remember them
20 Whatever
All  know is - this is it for me
Just me, my bag, and a series of shithead boyfriends
It'd be good to see something else
Have a nighttime life
Be somebody different
Terri pauses, then smiles like she's just realized something
Hey
this is great, isn't it
Just girls talking
Like having a conversation
Good coffee
You got a cigarette
Joey waits, letting herself catch up with Terri's good-natured but marginally strung-out personality
She looks around the room as if trying to remember where there are cigarettes
Uh
yeah
Yeah, somewhere
Wait a minute
Joey crosses to the big shelf-unit and pulls out a concealed pack of cigarettes, a Zippo lighter, and an ashtray from behind a shelf of videos
We notice that the videos are , volumes 1 thru 26
She brings the smokes to Terri
Great
Thanks
You gonna have one
'm trying to quit
Oh, go on
Have one
Fuck it
You think you're going to live forever
She smiles and proffers the pack to Joey who shrugs, smiles, and takes one
Terri picks up the Zippo and sparks it
huge leaps out of the lighter, producing an instant of terror from Terri
Joey pulls the lighter back from Terri and closes the lid extinguishing the flame
Terri draws a book of matches from her pocket shakily attempts to light her cigarette
Sorry
It was my father's
It's temperamental
It's okay
It's just someone burned me once
21 Joey takes the book of matches from Terri's hands and lights both cigarettes
Terri takes a long, fearful look at the burning flame and then takes a deep, calming drag of her cigarette
Wanna know how  look at it
Way  see it is
you give up, right
Three days later, you get hit by a fucking truck and you know - you just that your last thought as you go under those wheels'd be "Jesus
Christ, coulda smoked another three packs
" She lays the book of matches down
Joey's eyes go to them
Black letters on the dark-grey cover:
Terri's eyes flick to the match-book and her mood changes, becoming subdued and a little sullen
Oh
You wanna talk about that stuff
Yes  do
Terri, something awful happened to that boy
have to find out what it was
But  don't know anything
Really just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street
He
Did you know him
No
'd seen him in there a few times before
He was just a punk
'd never like danced with him or anything
Anyway, he was a thief
He must've taken it from the statue
Taken what
The thing
He was lying there in the street, moaning
But he pointed at it 22 Wait a minute
He was already
wounded
when you found him
Yeah
That's what 'm saying
And it was lying next to him
And he pointed at it before he passed out and
Wait
Wait
The chains
Where did the chains come from
That's what 'm trying to tell you
Terri rummages in her bag, getting hold of something
He said they came out of this
She holds her hand out and the camera  in to meet it
' / Resting on her palm is a black cube about 4 inches square
It has the same matt-black carbonized look as the pillar and is recognizable as one of the "carvings" we saw on it
There is fine filigree pattern-work over each of its surfaces and, to audiences familiar with the  movies, the box is recognizable despite its black coating; it is the Lament Configuration, the puzzle box that opens the doors to Hell
There is a stubby shard of material protruding from one side of the box - presumably where the boy from  had broken it off the pillar
Camera favors this jagged shard as we - on its upper left section
We are looking at a hole in the pillar that matches the pattern of the shard on the Box
The club is empty
The dim lighting of working hours has been replaced with the sickly gleam of one or two fluorescent tubes and the club has that eerie not-quite-right look that all night places have when subjected to a harsher light
23 Two  are in the final stages of clearing the night's debris - emptying trash into big black plastic bags, wiping down tables and bars etc
Work completed, they head to the main exit
One of them hits the light switches so that the fluorescent clarity is again replaced by the more appropriate dim lighting
The other shouts across the apparently deserted club
All done, Mr
Monroe
They stand a second but no response comes
The first turns to the second and shrugs
(mouthing silently) Ass hole
His co-worker grins and they let themselves out
beat
Another door opens into the club and  Monroe  the club's owner and the man we saw buy the pillar -  walks into the main room of the club from his private room at the back
walks out into the shadowed darkness of his small kingdom
He describes a circle around the dance floor, throwing glances at his odd sculptures, and finally walks into the center of the room to stand before the pride of his collection, the pillar
The pillar of course is stationary at this time, though it is still mounted upside down
smiles possessively at the pillar - and then registers the mutilation where the Box has been ripped away
What the
He leans in closer to stare at the hole
Suddenly, jarringly, there is a quiet but distinct  that seems to come from within the hole
starts back a little, a small expression of anxiety on his normally supercilious face
He glances to right and left, gets a grip, and leans forward again
/ - as, again, the noise comes
Is it a squeak - or is it the creaking shifting of hidden machinery, hidden chains
24 's hand moves tentatively into shot, approaching the hole
Slowly, slowly, it reaches wrist-deep into the blackness
on 's face - quizzical, enquiring
and suddenly contorted in pain
Aaaaaahh
/ - as 's hand whips out of the hole, shaking in shock and pain
rat is hanging on to one of 's fingers, its sharp teeth buried in the flesh
swings his arm violently through the air, dislodging the rat with the force of his swing
spray of blood is seen to come from 's wounded finger
- as it lands heavily in a shadowed corner of the club and scurries away deeper into the darkness, squeaking furiously
- as he looks down at his finger, face snarling
Son of a
Blood seeps from the tiny teeth marks
(off) bi
's voice is cut off by a strange   heard
's face moves up to look at the pillar
look of awe and shock crosses his face
Some small drops of blood stand out bright red on the blackness of the pillar
The sizzling noise is coming from them
Suddenly the drops draw together magically into one large ruby of blood - already larger than possibility would allow
Then it gets wierder; the blood suddenly dissipates into six or seven little rivulets that begin to run down the pillar
25 The streams of blood don't simply fall straight
They seem to follow some pre-gouged pattern, running down the pillar tracing the blackened organic contours of the carvings
They all culminate at the point of Pinhead's chin - and then separate again, running over his frozen black face along the carved scar lines that make a matrix across his features
When every canal line on the demon's face is filled neatly with blood, a   seems to glow from within the pillar through Pinhead's face, giving it temporarily the blue tone he had enjoyed in (un)life
on his awe-struck face - bathed in reflected blue light
- as gradually the blueness subsides again, the visible blood vanishing with it, leaving the same frozen implacable blackness as before but charged now with a waiting power
, '
( ) (off) Oh my God
frying pan sits atop a burner
it contains the ugliest mess of scrambled eggs you have ever seen
or perhaps it's an omelette
There are other ingredients in there but they're burnt so black they're unrecognizable
At least half of the mixture lies all over the stove top instead of in the pan
(off) Did  sleep through an earthquake
- showing the chaos all around the kitchen: Spilled flour on work surfaces; Egg-shells on the linoleum;  knocked-over glass of orange juice, the juice soaking into a piece of kitchen roll; Coffee as black and thick as a mix of Indian ink and molasses
26 Joey, in her dressing-gown, stands in the doorway with a shocked expression on her face
Terri, in an oversized man's shirt, stands by the stove holding a fish-slice and smiling nervously
figured 'd make breakfast
Right
That's
er
that's nice of you, Terri
Can  ask
Is it always this
exploratory
Ha
don't know yet
First time
Kitchen virgin, that's me
Joey nods slowly, crossing to a cabinet and taking out some instant coffee
'll boil some water
'll do it
No
No, that's
like to
love boiling water
It's a specialty of mine
Why don't you go watch cartoons
Joey watches Terri walk out of the kitchen, sighs in relief, and grabs the kettle
, ' '
Joey sits, drinking her coffee, as Terri walks round the room with hers
This is great
And it's yours
You like own it
The bank owns it
But 'm working on it
Jeez, 've never owned anything haven't even had a room of my own since was fifteen years old
27 How have you
Guys
Sometimes friends
Mostly guys
Terri walks past Joey's  set (sound down, cartoons playing)
The Box is on top of the
In the warm light of morning it seems innocuous and harmless, like just another ornament
- as Terri walks on, pausing by the shelves of books
Wow
Lotta books
You read all these
No
buy them to impress people
Of course 've read them
Cool
read a book once
It was like all these people discovering who they used to be
You know, like reincarnation
It was really good
You ever read that
don't think so
But it's a fascinating subject
Did you
But Terri has already moved on
She is by the big picture window
The drapes are now open
Great view
Great view
Look at this
Joey stands and walks to join Terri
Actually, 'm pretty familiar with the view
'  - Joey's apartment is on a high floor and her window overlooks many lower buildings, giving a view of the city beyond
28 (off) but it is good
You know, over to the left, you can
(looking to right and pointing) Who's that
On the flat roof of a nearby building, a sits motionless in an old rusty deck chair next to a small Jerry-built pigeon coop
Its door is open and it is empty
The boy is some distance from the girls but his solitude, his stillness, and the empty coop beside him lend the scene an atmosphere of sadness and loss
As Joey tells his story, we  between the  of the roof and the girls at the window
don't know his name
saw the whole story
wounded bird was on his roof
could hear its cries from here
He went straight to it
couldn't've
'd be frozen between pity and fear
But he wasn't
Its pain spoke directly to him
He picked it up
Nursed it
Fed it
And it got better
Everyday he'd watch the pigeon
Everyday the pigeon would watch him
saw him learn
Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete
And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away
Didn't look back
But he heard the sound of its wings
And he still sits there
Every day
Maybe he thinks it'll come back
No
He knows it won't
It was his final act of love and part of him knows that and part of him doesn't yet
29 Bullshit
He should've kept it
It'd live longer
It's dangerous out there
People get hurt
- as she realizes she has a wounded pigeon of her own
What
wasn't talking about
Do you want to stay
You want to stay here for a while
Terri shrugs, gives a nervous smile
Joey crosses to the , picks up the Box and weighs it in her hand
It's a done deal
But look you have to help me
've got to solve this thing
've got to know what's going on
Terri follows across the room and sits on the sofa
But  don't know what's going on
Maybe not
But you know more than  do
You know something about this box
Something about a statue
Yeah
found it
knew held like it and  figured
Woah
Wait a minute
Who
The kid
No
My last boyfriend
He like owns the club
You know
You were there
He bought the statue
That you found
What do you mean you found it
30 was downtown looking for a
a friend
guy  know
Anyway, there was this store
Like real old
Lotsa weird shit in there
saw this statue
Pillar
Thing
knew he'd love it
You've seen the club
Would you know this store again
Sure
Why
It's Saturday morning
Let's go shopping
Joey's Mazda 323 drives down the street
The daylight street is still creepy but in a different way; No bums, no trash-can fires, nothing
It has the feel of a ghost town, as if nothing has breathed here for years
Joey, at the wheel, has a disbelieving look on her face
Terri, smoking, flicks ash through her wound-down window
Jesus
Are you sure this is the street
Yeah
Happening, isn't it
What on earth were you doing down here
An evasive silence
Terri
Buying some drugs, alright
Oh, Terri
31 For somebody else, alright
Not for me
don't do that shit anymore
Then you shouldn't even be around it
You know, it's
Here
Here
Pull over
Joey brings the car to a halt outside the antique store
Terri scrambles out of the passenger door
Yeah
See
told you it was here
- as she looks at Terri from behind, her face worried for her new and screwed-up friend
Joey and Terri enter the store
The store is different, its selection of merchandise reduced
The 50's and 60's junk hardware is still there, along with some of the more mundane Victoriana, but it seems more "normal" none of the odd items of punishment memorabilia are there
Also, because it is daylight, the store seems merely old, interesting, and musty, not creepy or odd
There seems to be no-one in attendance
- as they walk through the store
(off) Can  help
The voice startles the girls and they jump around to face the counter as   moves into view from beneath it
Mama, an ancient and slightly eccentric Italian-American woman eyes the girls with the suspicion of somebody who hasn't had a customer in decades
Not aggressive, just surprised
32 Yes
Thank you
We were wondering
Terri, show her the box
Terri removes the box from her purse and holds it up
No
Sorry
Not interested
Not for my customers
Have you tried
No
No, you don't understand
We're not selling it
It came from here
We want
Everything sold as is
No guarantees
No returns
No
We want
took back everything bought on a whim, 'd have no business
Lady, will you shut the fuck up and give her a break
sudden silence
Both Mama and Joey stare at Terri in surprise
Mama looks back at Joey
Quite a mouth
So what's the problem
You tell me
You  like
Joey smiles
Terri raises her eyes to heaven
Mama waits
Thank you
This came off a
statue
pillar
We wondered if you knew anything about the piece
About where it came from
Mama squints at the box, as if trying to recognize it
Oh
yeah
Yeah
That thing
Ugly
Real ugly
sold that
Mama's eyes scan the store
33 Never mind
'm glad it's gone
Made the store feel strange
Who'd make such a thing
Fine
Fine
But can you tell us anything about it
It was part of a job-lot
Some loony- bin they shut down
Unclaimed stuff
What else came with it
Anything still here
Sure
Just papers, photos
Stuff nobody'd ever want
Can we see
You gonna buy
don't know
Maybe
Right at the back there
Middle shelves
Coupla folders
Nice stuff
'd do you a good price
: Joey and Terri approach an old shelf unit along the rear wall
shaft of sunlight throws a square of light on the wooden floor a few yards in front of the shelves
Joey takes up a big bulging manilla folder from the shelves and begins to look through it
Terri, check out the other folder
Terri, still holding her purse and the box, looks around for somewhere to put them
All the shelves are full
She lays them on the floor in the square of sunlight and joins Joey at the shelves, grabbing up the second folder
34 What am  looking for
God knows
Anything
Contacts
Clues
Terri opens up the folder and begins to pace the floor as she flicks through the contents
Jesus
You're gonna pay her for this shit
It's like fucking business papers for God's sake
Bored, Terri wanders off to lean against another shelf-unit
' - as she flicks through the contents
Terri's dismissive summary seems justified
All Joey sees are obscure and meaningless case-notes and paperwork
Each item is letter-headed
Joey's hand reaches a large envelope
Scrawled in hand across it is the phrase
-
Joey draws the contents out and begins to sift through them
The first item is a dusty, black-and-white photograph of an officer in English Army uniform, circa 1920
Joey blows the dust from the photo
- - which sits on the floor in the shaft of sunlight, the dust from the photo settling next to it
The next photo is that of a beautiful young woman
Joey flips it over
Gummed on the back is a type-written slip that says ,
5719
The sounds of the girls flicking through papers is heard and then  as something strange begins to happen
Suddenly, the dust around the box begins to move as if blown by an invisible wind
It is drawn up so that it forms an impossible spiral in the air
Spinning like a miniature hurricane, it hovers over the box
The sunlight seems to grow brighter
Is it just reflections on the metalwork designs or is the box itself glowing and shining
35 ' - as her eyes flick back and forth as she scans
Joey turns another item and her face registers surprise at what she is seeing
The next item in the folder is a Xerox sheet, a reproduction of what appears to be an ancient document
It is a diagram, like a designer's drawing or plan
And it is of the box seen from various angles
' - as she realizes what she is looking at
(softly) Alright
Joey turns, folder in hand, to look at the box on the floor and compare it to the diagram
Joey gasps
The miniature tornado of spiralling dust suddenly disappears inside the apparently sealed box as if sucked down into it
As if on cue, the shaft of sunlight disappears behind a cloud as the last particle of dust disappears into the box
Joey, mouth open in shock, lets the folder drop from her hand
The sound of its splayed contents hitting the floor alerts Terri, who walks back round from the other shelf unit
Terri looks at the dropped contents and then up at Joey
Joey
(still staring at Box) Help me pick 'em up, Terri
think the lady just made a sale
, ' Joey is sitting behind a desk
She has a phone in one hand and a pen in the other
Spread out over the desk are various documents - the photo of Kirsty, the diagram of the box, type-written transcripts etc - and a scratch-pad on which Joey has scrawled several numbers
36 Joey is in mid-conversation on the phone
Yeah
yeah
yeah
No, it's important that  speak to
What
No, don't
(a beat)       Put
Me
On
Hold
You
Stupid
Bitch
Joey slams the phone down
She stares at the papers, at the scratch pad, takes a deep breath, and punches out a number on the phone
This time Joey's voice is different
Hi
Now listen
And listen good
'm the Station Manager at -
For the last half-hour you've been dicking around with my assistant
Let me tell you something
With or without your co- operation we are making this expose assume you're smart enough to guess which version is going to make you look good
Now, if you can't put one hand on that cassette and the other on a FedEx man's butt within thirty seconds then you damn well better put me through to somebody who can
pause while somebody jumps through hoops at the other end
Joey's voice transmogrifies again; now it's a seductive, persuasive purr
Dr
Fallon
How nice of you to take my call
understand you're in charge of video archive from the Channard Institute
Another night in Under The Underground Kids dance
Customers jostle at the bar
Couples neck in shadowed corners
Loud Metal music blasts out from speakers next to the various sculptures on the walls and ceiling
37 The center of the dance-floor is packed
The pillar is missing
Sitting alone at a bar stool - though surrounded by tightly- packed customers - is , a very pretty teenage girl
She is the same basic type as Terri; blonde, frail, young
Too young, in fact, to be legally in a club like this
Sandy stares at her empty glass - and stares at it wistfully enough to suggest she doesn't have the money to get it refilled
She is trying to keep up a cool impassive face but her eyes betray her basically vulnerable character
Sitting at the opposite end of the bar, his eye-line confirming he is looking at Sandy, is  Monroe
The bar-stool beside  is occupied by a   who has his back to the bar and is talking to a  of his
has a speculative, predatory look on his face
Without shifting his gaze, he raises his hand and within seconds the is leaning over to hear his request
on Sandy as a full glass is placed in front of her
Laid alongside the glass is a beautiful long-stemmed red rose
Sandy looks surprised at the drink and then smiles in delight at the rose
She raises her eyes and looks across the bar
returns the smile
He turns to the Boy beside him and murmurs something unheard
The boy glances round, as if ready to argue with whoever is speaking to him
On recognizing , however, he vacates the seat without an argument and stands to join his friends
looks back across the bar at Sandy and gestures at the empty stool beside him, an attractive welcoming smile on his face
Sandy gets up and, carrying the drink and the rose, makes her way across to sit beside
The deafening music playing in the club means that they have to lean in close to hear each other speak
Welcome
38 You're  Monroe, right
Uh-huh
And this is your club
Great club really love it here
Great club
Thank you
Thank you for the drink
And the rose
Wow
That's
really nice
It's yours
You won it
It's a prize
prize
For what
You see, everyday  have my friend John here bring
The barman
thought he was called Rick
He's a barman
Whatever
Do you mind if  continue
'm sorry
Everyday  have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar
And  award it to a woman of exceptional beauty
Oh come on
There're lots of girls here who look better than
Don't do that
Don't put yourself down
If you have a quality, be proud of it
While talking, and without taking his eyes off Sandy, gestures at the barman and their glasses
39 Let it define you
Whatever it is
Most of the roses die behind the bar
This is the first 've given out for nearly a month
No
Really
Two full glasses join the still half-full ones on the bar
Yes really
Wow
Thank you
No
Thank you
- Now there are six empty glasses on the bar and two half-full ones
- except they're not there
The two bar-stools are empty
' The music  from the club is dull and muffled
JP1s private room is the size - and shares the general appearance of - an expensive studio apartment
His room looks like an annex to his club - black walls, black fittings, artworks of elegant cruelty - show that 's taste for the bizarre is not just professional
Camera explores the room as the sound of  grows
- now the right way up, it stands in a corner of the room
As usual, it looks jarring and impressive but it doesn't really seem out of place in 's room
The Breathing  becomes mixed with  and
40 and Sandy, both naked, are on the bed making love
Well, maybe Sandy's making love
's having sex
It is a selfish, phallocentric scene, concentrating on 's concern only for his own gratification
It may be an erotic sight, but it's not a pretty one
is on top
He has hold of both Sandy's wrists in one of his hands and his body is working away rhythmically
He is half- upright, looking down at her
No kissing
on 's face - his eyes open, staring down at Sandy
on Sandy's face - her eyes closed, half in pleasure, half in shame
- on Pinhead's face
Suddenly, horribly, the monster's eyes fly open and his frozen face stares down at the lovers seems to pulse from within the pillar, lending color to Pinhead's face
Pinhead continues to watch the love-making until it comes to a climax
As   out his orgasm and collapses forward onto Sandy's body, Pinhead's eyes close
The   disappears and the pillar is just the pillar again
, ' -  the telephone/answering machine, its red message light blinking in the darkness of the apartment
Heard  is the sound of Joey coming in to her apartment - doors opening and closing, bags being put down, footsteps etc
Joey's hand comes into frame and presses the message button
- as Joey waits for her machine and glances around the room for Terri
Terri
- ' 41 The sofa is empty
Joey looks puzzled and is about to call again when the machine kicks in
(on ansafone) Ms
Summerskill
Joanne
Hello
This is Dr
Fallon
Martin
Your reference material is on its way to you
very much enjoyed talking to you and  hope that if 'm ever in town you'll do me the honor of (sqwaaaaalk) Joey has her finger on the fast forward button
In your dreams, pal
The chipmunk-squeal of Fallon's voice is replaced by the warning-beep of a second message
Joey lets it play
(on ansafone) your number from your resume
Which was very impressive, by the way
My name is Sharon Leech and you can reach me here at - in Monterey, area code 805
(sqwaaalk) Joey stops the tape
(to herself) Shit
Why now
Why not last week
Oh
She glances round at the empty room again, troubled by Terri's absence
She crosses to her bedroom door
' Joey enters the darkened room - and then stops a few feet from the door
Terri - lit only by the moonlight through the blinds - is lying on one side of Joey's bed fast asleep
Apart from her shoes, which she has kicked off, she is fully dressed
Joey approaches the bed and watches her sleeping friend, her face sympathetic, affectionate, and troubled
Joey reaches over, takes one of the pillows from the other side of the bed, and lays it at the bottom end
42 She slips off her shoes, shrugs off her jacket, and - delicately, carefully - climbs on to the other side of the bed, laying her head on the pillow she had moved
(whispered) Goodnight, Terri
' , on his bed in his shorts enjoying a post-coital cigarette, blows smoke-rings at the ceiling and all but ignores Sandy
Sandy has put some of her clothes back on and is wandering around the room, admiring it and chattering
So cool
She approaches the pillar
leans in close
closer
and nothing happens
Radical
She walks on to look at a painting on one of the walls
It's a painstakingly rendered but crudely imagined piece
The kind of crap you'd buy in a Melrose gallery
Perhaps it's called Biker Crucifixion
Night-time, somewhere rural
Hell's Angel, arms outstretched and stripped to the waist, is tied to a tree by cruelly-tight barbed wire wrapped around his body
At the foot of the tree his biker friends party, drink, and fuck, Harleys parked in the distance
The crucified Angel's eyes are raised to the Moon
He's smiling
Wow
You've got great taste
This
well
this really says it, you know
It's really
dark
Still staring at the ceiling,  pulls a pained face - like he's heard this embarrassing shit a hundred times
Don't you think
43 Mmn-hmnn
Sandy turns to look at , troubled by his unresponsiveness
Do you mind me talking about your stuff
Unh-unh
beat
Sandy stares at
stares at the ceiling
If it bothers you, just say so
sighs
It doesn't bother me
'm just not interested
Oh
Like 'm not an interesting person
blows a smoke ring at the ceiling
Sandy walks back across the room to stand at the foot of the bed
( And yes, fright fans, this does put her in front of the pillar - though hopefully the blossoming argument will distract audience attention
) But you gave me a rose
And tomorrow 'll give one to somebody else
Get dressed
Get out
You shit
Who do you think you are
'm  Monroe, you stupid little bitch
Now get the fuck out of my life
You
can't fucking believe you, you bastard
You get me in here
Right
Like you were hog-tied or something
44 Look at you
You think you're some God damn Prince or something
With your shitty little Kingdom out there and all this ugly shi
Sandy is waving her arms to illustrate her point and, halfway through her last line, has turned to indicate the pillar
Suddenly -
- two blackened arms fly out from the center of the pillar and grab Sandy's gesturing arms
The   burns from within, illuminating Pinhead's face as his eyes open, filled with demonic glee and hunger
An impossible  begins to whistle through the room, as if an echoed glimpse of a storm in Hell
Sandy screams in mortal terror
jumps from the bed, cigarette falling to the floor
He backs away to the opposite wall, face shocked, scared shitless
Jesus Christ
Pinhead smiles sardonically
Not quite
Pinhead's arms pull Sandy tight against the pillar and his face, stifling her scream
flattened against the far wall, watches in horror as Sandy, held tight against the pillar, suffers a horrible death: Sandy's life-force is sucked from her
Drawn into the pillar
Into Pinhead
It is a matter of seconds only but, in those few seconds - Her body begins to collapse in on itself, turning grey and lifeless
It is made worse by the fact that until the very end Sandy keeps struggling, writhing in the grasp of the monster
The wind keeps blowing through the room
Finally, a dry lifeless husk, she is dropped to the floor
The Blue Light fades from within the pillar
The wind disappears
45 The pillar is again black and stationary
But its contours are different, more rounded
It looks more organic, as if shifting its raw material into new alignments, new configurations
The pillar seems to be in a process of becoming
And the obvious suggestion is that what it is becoming is Pinhead
Pinhead's head, arms, and torso now protrude from the pillar
They are not completely free and - now that the "eating" of Sandy is concluded - seem incapable of independent movement but there is plainly a lot more of him than there was before
Even though the blue light has faded, Pinhead's face is noticeably different
It is blue-tinged and more fleshy in appearance
Capable of movement
And speech
- who has sunk to the floor, staring at the pillar
What
What
What did you see
The same as
Appetite sated
Desire indulged
You saw the working of the world in miniature
shakes his head in denial
But he's already a little more together than he was: after all, the pillar can't move and he's several yards from it
That had nothing to do with the world
Not this one, anyway
On the contrary
It has everything to do with the world
And our dreams of how it will succumb to us
You enjoyed the girl
Yes
Good
So did
And that's all
No
No
It's not the same
No
What you did
it was
evil
Pinhead laughs
46 How uncomfortable that word must feel on your lips
Evil
Good
There is no Good, Monroe
There is no Evil
There is only the flesh and the patterns to which we can submit it
You will help me to
shakes his head in furious denial
No
No no no
No fuckin' way
'm gone
Grabbing at his jeans,  heads out of his room
Rapidly
, The sun is high
It's about noon
Like most clubs of its type, Under The Underground's exterior is far from prepossessing
It's set in an old brick warehouse in a run-down section of town
's Range Rover pulls up and  gets out, carrying a long slim black bag
He glances round the all-but-deserted street and enters the club
' on Pinhead's face; in repose, back to its statue-like state
The sound of the door  opens the monster's eyes
enters, closing the door behind him
He doesn't look at the pillar
He stays by the door and keeps his eyes on the long black bag he has brought in with him
He unzips it
His manner is that of a man who has made a decision and is not about to listen to contrary argument
(off) Another offering
doesn't respond
He draws a double-barrelled shotgun from the bag, cocks it, and loads it
turns to face the pillar, drawing a bead on Pinhead
Pinhead's expression is wearily amused
47 'm touched
That is the gun you used to kill your parents
visibly staggers as Pinhead lets slip this knowledge
Pinhead smiles
understand
Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional
What else could you do
Fuck you
He pulls the double trigger
massive  resounds around the room but that's about it; the 30 ott six is absorbed magically into the pillar
Thank you
Now, shall we talk sensibly
lets the useless gun fall from his hand
Don't flee from yourself
If you have a quality, let it define you
Cultivate it
It is you
By helping me, you will help yourse
What
What are you talking about
Why should  help you
Because you want to
You've always wanted to
Look at your pictures
Look at your sculptures
Look at those tawdry representations and then
Imagine
Imagine a world of the body as canvas
The body as clay
Your will and mine as the brush and the knife
Oh,  have such sights to show you
It's working
's eyes are glittering with excited interest
What are you
48 dark star rising
was bound to another's system by a soul  once possessed
friend relieved me of that inconvenience
Now 'm free
Born again of Blood and Desire
Hey, that's what makes the world go round
Pinhead raises an amused eyebrow at 's little joke
You see, we're not so dissimilar
But how in God's name
God
My God was diamond and black light
And  was his Dark Pope
All that is changed
terrible beauty is born
With a place at my right hand for a man of your tastes
cruises the room, contemplating this
How do we start
It has already begun
, Many screens fill the frame, all of them crackling with snow
Joey is alone at the control desk
She has a video tape in her hand and feeds it into the master machine
She looks up at the still-ghosting monitors and then presses a few buttons on the console
The snow is replaced by blackness on every monitor with a time code ticking away at the bottom of each screen
(softly) Alright
Let's see what we got here
49 The blackness on the monitors gives way to multiple images of , the girl in the picture in the antique store
The video image is primitive, shot with a non-professional camcorder, and is a simple medium long-shot of Kirsty, dressed in a simple white smock, sitting in a hospital room
Kirsty addresses the camera directly, though occasionally looks up to the side as if speaking to an unseen doctor
through Kirsty's monologue between:  single monitor image, the wall of monitors, and the watching and listening Joey
(on video) don't know what the Box is
But know what it does
(looks up to side)     've said all this before
Do you
(blinks, nods, as if listening
Looks back to camera)   saw it open
opened it
saw what came out
don't know what else to call them
Demons
Demons live in the box
Or come through the box from somewhere else
It's a gateway to Hell
Or the South Bronx
(smiles ruefully at her own joke
Looks up to side as if chastised for kidding around
Nods
Continues)      know you don't believe me
know what it sounds like
But what else
Jesus, talk to Ronson, talk to the other cops
They saw the house
They saw my
my father
Kirsty breaks down into sobs
- - whose expression shows distressed sympathy
She too has lost her father
The video image breaks up into white noise and then comes back in, as if the camcorder was turned off for a few moments
When the image returns, Kirsty is smoking a cigarette to help calm her
50 (on video) Solving the puzzle means opening the box
Opening the box means opening doors
And there are some doors you don't want to open
And it may be metaphorical to you, Doctor, but you haven't had some blue-faced bastard come at you with hooks and chains
It isn't delusion, it isn't psychosis
It's reality
It's reality
(Pause
Long drag on the cigarette
)   Maybe not this reality
but there are others
've seen them
Joey's face shows horrified fascination at Kirsty's story
There is a conviction in the telling which is working on Joey
, ' The room is dimly-lit
The floor is littered with video-boxes and tapes
Other tapes are piled on top of the
It's like somebody has been viewing constantly for a week and hasn't put anything away
Many books are lying on the sofa, the table, and the floor
Some are lying open, most are closed
Also on the coffee table are three different soft-drink cans, a half- empty cup of coffee, and a very full ash-tray
Terri is standing by the bookshelfs, running her eyes and her finger along some titles
Now we understand the chaos in the room
Terri's home alone
She's bored and trying to find something to hold her interest
She looks away from the shelves and walks idly over to the
The Box is back on top of the
Terri's hand hovers near the on/off switch of the
Then it hesitates and picks up the box instead
Terri holds the box and looks at it
Her face becomes puzzled and she crosses the room to flick on a
She wanders back to the  looking at the box
51 It looks different
Its edges are more sharply defined
The shard where it was broken from the pillar is smaller, smoother
The detailed metal-work has some color back and is shining
Jeez, Joey musta polished you up some
Sometimes  think she's wierder than me
Terri's voice trails off as she continues to look at the box
She turns it in her hands, running her fingers over its filigree surfaces
in slowly as she cups it in both hands, her eyes moving from puzzlement to fascination and concentration
She rubs her thumbs over the designs
continues
It's tense
Is she going to try and work the puzzle
Suddenly
the phone rings
Terri jumps in shock, nearly dropping the box
She puts the box back on top of the  and crosses to the phone
She picks it up
Joey
(on phone) Not quite
Live and in the flesh
How're you doing, babe
What do you want
' on 's face as he speaks into a phone
God, always questions
What do  want
don't want anything
Just concerned about you
Just checking in
52 Yeah right
How'd you get this number
Will you relax
Your little girlfriend left a card, remember
Oh
Yeah
Yeah
Well

Things are great here
Joey's going to get me a job at the  station
'm meeting lotsa new people
It's really great
Really
Yeah really

No

Because 'm concerned for you, sweetheart

'm sorry we split up
'm sorry
You're apologizing
Hey, it has been known

Don't tell me you haven't thought about me
Huh
Well

Oh, , you were so horrible
You really hurt me

It's bad
'm a bad person
But  try not to be, Terri really do
And  really miss you

That's so good to hear, sweetheart
It really is
You know,

Yes
53 Good
Good
Look, why don't you come over
You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk
Just see how we both feel
Oh,  don't
'mon
It'll be great
, ' on Terri's face - we can almost see her summon the will- power to refuse
No
No
can't
just can't
She slams the phone down quickly before he can persuade her
She takes a couple of deep breaths and walks away from the phone
Shit
Shit
Shit
Shit
Shit
She looks around
She looks at the books
She looks at the videos
She looks at the table
She looks back at the phone
- as it  again
- shakes her head and turns the ansafone on
After two rings, the machine responds
(ansafone message) Hi
You've reached Joanne Summerskill
In spirit at least
Please leave a message
Thanks
54 (on phone) Hello
Ms
Summerskill, this is Sharon Leech again from - in Monterey
Sorry to call so late but  was wondering if you got my other message
Look,  probably shouldn't say this on tape but what the hell
there's a job here if you want it
Late-night news reader
We think you'd be marvelous
The machine  and cuts her off, leaving the message light on Terri's face - disappointed and sad
, Joey is still at the desk watching the bank of monitors
As Kirsty speaks,  between Joey and the monitors
(Looks to side)  Again
(Shrugs
Looks back at camera)  The box
don't know where it came from
don't know who made it or why
only know what it does
It hurts
It hurts
(Looks off to side as if listening
)  How
(Looks back)   don't know
It kind of opens itself
Your fingers move
You learn
It wants to open, that's the thing
And it knows when you want to open it
And it helps
And it opens
And then they come
The Cenobites
The demons
Multiple images of Kirsty speaking those last few lines
Suddenly, one - and only one - of the monitors suffers a -
Joey glances up at the one ghosting monitor, puzzled - and then freezes in shock
- as, on the one monitor, a new image suddenly appears: hazy, black-and-white image (very grainy, like early experimental  images) of a thirtysomething man in early twentieth century military uniform
55 The man -  - stares directly out of the monitor screen and, just as Kirsty finishes her last line ("The cenobites
The demons
"), he speaks (in an English accent)
(on monitor) She's telling the truth, Joey
Another  of   and the image is gone
Kirsty is back on that monitor, just like all the others
Look, you can have me tell this
Joey remains staring at the haunted monitor, numb with shock
What the hell is going on
Kirsty's voice plays  as Joey stares
as often as you want
There's not going to be any breakthrough
You might think it's delusion, but it's not saw them
looked into their eyes and they looked back at me
Creatures from Hell
24- late-night coffee-shop in the early hours of the morning
Classic American Diner
Empty booths
quiet counter
perches on a stool drinking coffee
in a booth by himself bites methodically on a donut, his eyes staring off into the vacancy of the night
In a corner booth,   nurse cokes and smoke cigarettes
black coffee sits by an ash-tray holding a burning cigarette
- sitting at the table staring at the coffee
She waits
She takes a drag on the smoke
She waits
She sips her coffee
She waits
She looks up across the diner
56 ' The double doors of the diner's entrance
She looks back down at her coffee
The sound of doors opening
Terri looks up again
- as somebody approaches Terri, whose face breaks into a nervous, ambiguous smile of welcome
- ' - as  walks confidently to her table, smiling
Hey, babe
Thanks for coming
sits down opposite her
He reaches over and pats her hand
, ' Joey enters the unlit main room
She glances across at the sofa
It's unoccupied
Joey puts the light on
She grimaces at the chaos of the room - the piles of videos and books - and crosses the room to the bedroom door
She opens the door and looks in
Terri, we can't bunk up every night
People will
The bedroom is empty, nobody on the bed
(off) talk
Terri
Joey leaves the door and walks back into the main room
She looks around and then walks over to the phone
Something has caught her eye
hand-scrawled note by the phone reads  , registers the note
57 Oh shit
Joey shakes her head sadly
What can she do
It's the early hours of the morning
She has no idea where Terri is
She walks back to the bedroom and closes the door behind her
(' ) Thick green jungle foliage obscures the view of a  camera
The sounds of confused battle are heard ; helicopters, gun- fire, distant explosions, screams of the dying and the wounded Leaves and branches  against the frame as the unseen dreamer rushes confusedly through the dense forest
The voices of the Soldiers - distant, echoed, repeated - are heard over the roar of battle
1 (off) He's going
He's going
He's going
2 (off) We're losing him
We're losing him
We're losing him
The sound of their voices seems to prompt the  camera to more furious endeavor
It turns rapidly left and right, forcing its way through the greenery until suddenly, with one last push through foliage thick enough to be a single bush, the view changes completely
( )         (' ) The  camera (Joey) walks out into another battlefield, one of a different character
It appears to be early morning
The skies are grey and overcast
In the distance plumes of black smoke spiral upward No jungle, no trees or grass
The ground is baked mud disfigured with deep trenches, re-inforced by wooden slats
The atmosphere is post-conflict; guns are silent, there are no cries or sound of machinery
Scattered around are corpses of many khaki-clad soldiers
58 Nothing moves
No birds sing
It is a horrible, desolate image from the bloody pages of history
The fields of Flanders in World War One
noise begins to be heard
low angry
cloud of buzzing flies are feeding on the flesh of his poor dead face
(off) Noooooooooo
The buzzing and Joey's anguished cry both   as we ' Joey sitting up in bed, eyes wide, still screaming
Nooooooooooo
The cry cuts off abruptly as Joey realizes where she is
She catches her breath and then freezes as she realizes that the buzzing sound from her dream is present in her bedroom
Are the flies still feeding
She glances around her room
- ' Her  set is on
The buzzing sound comes from white noise
Joey is puzzled and scared
Is somebody here
Is somebody here
Terri
She half gets out of bed and then stops, transfixed, as the screen's white noise is replaced by an image
As in the editing suite, the image is grainy black-and-white
The buzzing continues, now joined by  and  that fades in and out as if unseen hands are trying to tune into an impossibly distant station
59 Somewhere in the sound-montage we can almost hear whispering; "Joey, Joey, Joey
" On the screen, an English Officer - Elliott - is sitting cross- legged on the floor of a Quonset hut
On the floor in front of him is something at which he stares - something that the image is not sharp enough to show
- Fear vies with fascination in Joey's expression
What
What's going on
What's happening
The image disappears in a burst of  which in turn is replaced by another image, still monochrome and grainy;  head- and-shoulders of Elliott, staring directly out of the screen
You have to help me, Joey
burst of  and the image disappears completely
The is obviously not turned on
The room is silent
Joey stares at her dead  in numbed silence
She falls back into bed, pulling the covers protectively around her, staring at the ceiling
' is heard  and the room is lit,   by the door, his finger by the light-switch
He smiles into the room and walks in, looking behind as Terri hesitates by the door
Come on in
Terri moves past him
locks the door with a key he draws from his pocket
Terri registers this
calms her
60 Not a good neighborhood
People disappear
(a beat)  Feel like home
It's just like you left it
Terri moves into the room, glancing around herself cautiously
She registers the pillar
It's plainly different from the last time Terri saw it but - despite what the audience knows about it - it still seems inanimate; a black frozen carving, disturbing but harmless
Not quite
This wasn't here
No
But, as you can see, 'm having some work done on it
You found a real treasure for me, Terri
hope  can show you how grateful  am
Yeah
yeah, it looks different
Yeah, a girl  know helped smarten it up
Put her heart and soul into it
girl
Anyone  should know
Not now, no
mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what  mean
has been cruising the room as they speak
Now he's standing close to the pillar
Terri is still some distance from him
Yeah right
Look
Terri, listen
(a beat)   Why don't you come here and kiss me
mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right
Is it going to happen
Isn't it going to happen
Let's get it out of the way
See how we feel
Then we can relax
Talk
You know
61 pause - a tense one for the audience who know that  has obviously decided who Pinhead's next meal is
Terri looks at , half suspicious, half attracted
don't think so
Not yet
'm not ready yet
Sure
Sure
understand
It's cool
mean, we've got all night
smiles winningly and warmly
nice guy
nice smile smile a girl can trust
The pillar stands behind him, its dark inhabitant still and silent, waiting for the sacrifice
Series of shots (maybe all -) of kids dancing and drinking in the club to establish the passing of time - and to highlight the tension of the scene in 's room by its proximity to this (relative) normality
'         ( ) lounges against his wall, smoking, close to the pillar
Terri is sitting on the bed
She's upset
She's been telling about Joey and the phone message
That's terrible
What a bitch
She was obviously just using you, Terri
Ready to dump you the second she had what she needed, interfering little whore
No
It isn't
she wouldn't
It's like  must have done something wrong, you know
Freaked her out
Just fucked up something good again
Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me
You know that
It was my fault, babe, it really was
And you know 'm sorry
And 'm sorry to see you upset now hate to see you in pain like this
Terri looks up at him, her eyes vulnerable, on the verge of tears
She really wants to believe that he's being a nice guy
62 Really
Yes
God, yes
just want to hug you
To hold you
To tell you it's alright
God, the bastard's good at this
Terri breaks into small sobs and holds her arms out for him
No
No, sweetheart, you come to me
It's not fair
come over there
You know
We're on the bed
just
'cos you know how much you excite me
God, just looking at you
You're so beautiful
come over there and 'd just want to touch you
Feel you
Kiss you
And that isn't what this is about
'mon, babe, come to daddy
Let me make it better
Terri wipes her eyes, gives a small shy smile and stands up
She's walking toward
And the pillar
puts a hand out
He smiles
Re-assuring
Loving
Terri walks
Vulnerable
So in need of reassurance and love
-, , She's getting closer
closer
closer
- as he blows it
sidelong glance at the pillar
sudden naked hunger in the smiling eyes
single bead of sweat
Some tiny little thing that takes the lid off his game
Terri stops dead
She doesn't know what's happening but suddenly this doesn't feel right
No
Wait a
, smiling mask wiped off, leaps at Terri
Terri flings herself backward, screaming in shock and fear
Pinhead: suddenly animate and furious; eyes wide open, face contorted in frustrated rage, black arms clawing at the air
63 Bring her to me, boy
furious, confused scene of tension and struggle
has hold of Terri, trying to drag her to the monster
Terri fights back, screaming her disbelief and struggling and kicking against him
They are perilously close to the pillar
Pinhead is furious - roaring, tearing at the pillar with his hands as if trying to physically rip himself
free of it
Slowly, 's size and strength is telling; Terri is being dragged nearer and nearer to the demon
At the last possible second - when it seems it's all over, when Pinhead's snatching fingers are centimeters from Terri's flesh - Terri snatches up a heavy ornament from a shelf by the pillar and smashes  right across the head with it
collapses semi-conscious at the foot of the pillar
Terri throws herself back from the monster's grabbing arms
Pinhead snarls in frustration, hands clenched in fists of rage
Terri - safely feet away from the pillar - stands, shaking and breathless, eyes wide in horror and shock as she stares at this creature from nightmare
And suddenly Pinhead changes tack; he slides from the roaring beast of a moment before to his more usual persona - the glib, articulate Black Pope of Hell
Wait
Why run
Where to
Do you know where you are
'm
'm
You're at the door of dreams
And you can open it
What are you talking about
64 There are two keys in this room
On is in the pocket of this fool
You could take it out without me reaching you
(a beat)  Probably
And you could use it to let yourself back in to the world you know
The world you've always known; banal, hopeless, dreamless
Pinhead, as ever, is hitting the right buttons
Terri, as we know, has dreamed of dreaming
And
like
the other
The other is the key to dreams
To a world of black miracles and dark wonder
Another life of unknown pleasures
It's yours
Complete the pattern
Solve the puzzle
Turn the key
- as she looks at the monster
And smiles
Where is it
Pinhead returns the smile
It's lying bleeding at your feet
is on the floor, semi-conscious, bleeding from the head
(delerious
Ad-lib) Unhhh
Terri
what
no
Terri edges around the pillar to grasp one of 's limp arms
- - as the bond between tempter and tempted is strengthened
Terri holds 's arm out
Pinhead stretches his own arm forward
And  finally - for one brief second of terrifying clarity - realizes what's happening
65 (screaming) No
Terri
Please
didn't mean to
Too late
Pinhead's hand closes around his wrist
Terri leaps back out of harm's way
Pinhead - with awesome strength - yanks  up to his feet and pulls him close
He stares into the terrified face of
have such sights to show you
is sucked dry by Pinhead
And Terri watches, her face perversely excited by this - the first of the dark miracles that the monster had promised
/ - as the transformation of pillar into Pinhead is completed
Pinhead, fully-fleshed and incarnate, stands in the room
At his feet are the dry husk that was  and the steaming, hissing remnants of the pillar like a pool of black toxic oil
He turns and looks at Terri
Slowly, elegantly, he walks toward her
Terri backs away across the room
But she backs off slowly, sensuously, like an eager but nervous virgin bride ready for her groom
Camera moves in  on her glowing eyes and excited face
, ' on the Box
cloud of dust spirals out into the room in a reverse action of the dust in the antiques store
' on Joey's sleeping face
shows beneath her eyelids and she murmurs in her sleep
Very faintly  is the sound of distant music
Joey's eyes snap open and glance from side to side
She sits up in bed and registers the music, which seems to have grown in volume on her waking
66 It is strange, old-fashioned music;   palm-court string orchestra playing a sentimental waltz tune reminiscent of the 1920's or earlier
Joey looks around the room
There is no-one in the room
The  set is still dead
But
the bedroom door is open a crack and a very strange is creeping in from the main room
And that seems to be from where the music is coming
- as she gets out of bed
She's cautious and careful, moving slowly and quietly as she wraps a robe around herself and moves to the door
The music continues to play
She opens the door slowly and walks through
, ' This room too is empty
The music is louder and the soft warm pulse of the orange light is more distinct, bathing the walls and the furniture
- ' - as Joey tries to locate the source of the music and the light; The sofa
The bookshelfs
The  - with the still and inactive Box
The closed drapes over the big picture window
Finally - Both the music and the light seem to be centered on the closet door across the room
They're both coming from behind it
Joey approaches the closet, still tense, still careful
She opens the closet door and looks in
67 The closet is where Joey has stored her past
But she's stored it neatly
Boxed and piled on shelves are old magazines, old greetings cards, old photographs, old soft-toys, college diplomas, clippings from small-town newspapers ("Death of a Local Hero: Tommy Summerskill lost in Vietnam", "Joanne Summerskill Class Valedictorian: looks to career in Media") etc etc
Also in there, stuffed away at the top of the closet, is an old radio - a big old wood-and-wire-grille valve driven beauty from which the lilting music is coming
At some stage in its life, part of its casing was smashed away and the pulsing orange light is its flickering vacuum tubes
It's an old mains-powered model and its mains cord dangles off the shelf of the closet
This radio isn't plugged into anything except the paranormal
on Joey; staring at this broadcast from the beyond
How
Joey reaches up and brings the radio down from the shelf and out into the main room
She sets it down on the coffee table in front of the sofa
Formal, classical framing from a low angle - Joey and radio in foreground, big picture window and its closed drapes in the background
Joey kneels up in front of the table
She stares at the radio with the same kind of trapped fascination with which we have seen characters in the previous movies stare at the Box
Her fingers are drawn to the tuning dial as if to a puzzle
She plays with the dial, moving through various "stations"
Joey's face is open with expectation as she moves through them, as if she is waiting for clues
Or instructions
The music gives way to various ; An Indian voice giving some kind of commentary
The English words "" and "World Service" are heard amidst the punjabi
(Joey turns the dial) tired sad English voice; 68 and the King has sent a personal message of sympathy to the parents of those brave men who
(Joey turns the dial) resonant French voice; 'Oiseau chante avec ses doigts
Deux fois
(Joey turns the dial) Another burst of music, this time more raucous and syncopated
ragtime tune from the birth of Jazz
(Joey turns the dial) Dead Air
An ominous pause
And Elliott's voice
Joey
Look out your window
Joey shrinks back in nervous shock at this direct address
The radio goes dead
The tubes stop glowing
The room is now a dimly-lit place of shadow and suspense
Joey glances back over her shoulder at her closed drapes and then at the silent radio
She stands up slowly and crosses to the drapes
The camera rises and  in as she walks, framing those drapes like curtains in a theater
With one strong gesture, Joey sweeps the drapes open
And gasps
Instead of neighboring roof-tops and a view of the city, Joey is looking directly into the interior of a Quonset hut
It is the image from her  set though full-size, full-color, and apparently real
At the far end, Elliott sits cross-legged on the floor
In front of him on the floor is the puzzle box
Elsewhere in the hut;  camp-bed on which lie a gun-belt and an Officer's peaked cap
And an old-fashioned radio - the same radio that is still in Joey's room
69 - as she stares beyond her window into this impossible scene
Tell me
Tell me
Hello
on the elements in the hut, as we (and Joey) realize that everything in there is frozen in time
There is no movement, no sound
Wonderingly (but carefully) Joey stretches her arm out before her
When her arm reaches the threshold of the Quonset hut, it disappears into the space once occupied by window glass
She pulls her arm back sharply with an intake of breath
Maybe she even takes a half-step backward
'm seven floors up
'm seven floors up
can't
But she can
She summons her courage, steps over the sill, and walks into the impossible
We are looking at a solid wall
Then, through the wall, Joey walks into the Hut, still bewilderment by the sights around her
Still the image does not move
Everything is very real, very present
But frozen
Joey approaches the immobile Elliott and looks from him to the box and back again
(: Joey's speeches to the frozen Elliott are bravado; her face and body language betray her awed nervousness at the bizarre situation in which she finds herself
) Now what
'm here
Now what
just walked into madness for you
Talk
Joey looks back behind her
- ' There is no window back into the apartment, just a fourth wall
70 Great
That's just great
You bring me here
You freeze up on me
And now there's no way out
've had dates like you before
is heard
Joey looks up
' At the far end of the Quonset Hut, behind Elliott, a door has creaked open an inch or two
Joey looks from the door back to the frozen Elliott
Thanks
think
Joey crosses to the door and opens it
She walks through
Joey walks out onto the World War One battlefield of her most recent dream
She stands there - an incongruous vulnerable figure in her nightdress and robe - amidst the corpses, the trenches, and the distant plumes of smoke
What's going on
Is this a dream
She glances back at the door of the hut she has just left
'  - Within the hut, the frozen Elliott still sits
- as she turns from looking into the hut and gasps, her eyes wide in shock
Standing on a hillock, framed against the grey battlefield skies, is Elliott
Joey walks toward him
Elliott stands calmly and smiles at Joey
Joey
How kind of you to come
beat
Joey (and the audience) take in Elliott's impossible presence, as she and he stand amidst the corpse-strewn field
71 Wait
wait
You
you have to help me
don't understand
Am  dreaming this
You have to help me
You will understand
And no, you're not dreaming
Do you know where we are
It's
don't know
First World War, right
Correct
The fields of France
And many dead flowers
Oh
Forgive me
My name was Spenser
Elliott Spenser
Captain
He extends his hand
Joey - slowly and nervously - puts her hand out to shake his
Joey Summerskill
Elliott smiles understandingly as he releases her hand
Well done
Brave girl
You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am  right
Captain Spenser
Elliott
What the Hell is going on
Hell is precisely what is going on, Joey
And we have to stop it because of a special obligation, you because you're the only person who can help
And because you know what is right, and just, and true
Will you walk with me a while
He gestures with his hand and they begin to walk
72 There were days in this war, days right on top of each other, when the newly dead were numbered in the tens of thousands
They called it the war to end all wars
Though it didn't
You know that
There were more wars
More dead
Your father's war
Your dream search for your father led you here
To me
Joey, we need to talk
Elliott does nothing dramatic - he doesn't clap his hands or snap his fingers - but somehow, magically, he and Joey, without moving or changing position are back in the Quonset hut
The frozen Elliott is still sitting on the floor before the box
The mobile Elliott gestures at his frozen self as he speaks to the bemused Joey
The war pulled poetry out of some of us
Others it affected differently
This is me a few years later
We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921
was like many survivors
Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification
We'd seen God fail, you see
So many dead
For us God, too, fell at Flanders
We adjusted to the loss
And if we mourned, we mourned in silence
Thousands drank themselves to death
Others went further
went further thought  was a lost soul
But, until this frozen moment,  didn't even know what the phrase meant
And what is
this frozen moment
The cusp of my life
What  was, what am, what  will be
past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision
was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures
Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery
And what did you discover
73 Something bad
And why are you back
Why are we here
Again, no signal from Elliott but the background changes magically once more; Elliott is once again framed dramatically on the hillock, Joey standing close
Because something worse is coming
(a beat) opened the Box, Joey
found the monster within it
And it found the monster within me
For decades  served Hell with no memory of my former life until a friend released me
You saw her
Kirsty Cotton
Yes
But
if your soul was freed, why are you back
Because - monster as  was -  was bound by Laws
The protocol of Hell
The Box had to be opened to let me out
The truly innocent were safe
That's no longer true
The shell of the beast has been fleshed
What  was is out there, Joey
In your world
Unbound
Unstoppable
What will he do
What does he want
He'll do what he does best
But he'll do it unfettered
He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering
What can we do
74 like you, Joey
You ask all the right questions
There is something we can do but it will require great courage
don't know
Elliott reaches out and strokes her cheek
Gently
Lovingly
We see in Joey's eyes that there is a response there response beyond the comradely
Joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another
You're stronger than you think
Then tell me what to do
This is his first night on Earth
He wants to close the door behind him
Like all Lieutenants, he covets command
There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back
He has to destroy it
So where is it
Your apartment
Joey gasps
Wha
The Box, Joey
He wants the Box
Lights flash
Music pounds
Kids dance
It's a wild night at Under The Underground and it's about to get wilder
The source music (thrash metal) builds and builds, as if heading for a climax
And then the climax comes
' 75 The door  open explosively from within
The pieces of the shattered door  across the dance-floor, accompanied by chunks of plaster and brick from the door-surround
( ) Flying wood and masonry hit people
One chunk  into the  console, bringing the music to a scratching, screeching end
Various  are heard  through the ensuing silence
In the confusion, kids scramble for the main doorway
Is it a bomb
Is it a street-gang attack
The Main Doorway  supernaturally shut, bolts flying into place untouched by human (or inhuman) hand
Confused and frightened faces turn back to look at the source of the explosion
' Lit from behind by blinding beams of  , Pinhead emerges through the doorway
Slow
Elegant
Terrifying
Pinhead surveys the scene before him and the terrified and awe- struck crowd look back at him
For the most part, the crowd are stunned into silence but there are a few murmurs from them; (ad-lib) Oh My God
Jesus Christ
What the
No no no no no no no
Pinhead scans the club
He looks at the terrified humans
The cruelly beautiful artworks
The humans
The artworks
The humans
The artworks
small smile forms on his face
He's just had an entertaining idea
76 , ' The view through the big picture window is entirely normal again; the cityscape by night
Suddenly, Joey seems to appear behind the glass - translucent, like a reflection - and comes through the window into her apartment, "solidifying" as she steps in
Her hands are at her head and she staggers forward a few steps
It's as if the enormity of her trip thru realities has just hit her
She falls forward onto the floor of her room, unconscious
- as the ringing of a phone grows in volume
Joey raises her head, bleary-eyed, and glances round the room trying to locate the source of the noise that has woken her
She crawls the few feet to the phone and snatches at it
The hand-set falls and she has to gather it up from the floor
Maneuvering herself into a sitting position, she speaks
Hello
(on phone) You wanted a story
You got it
Turn on the  now
And then get your ass down here
(click)
Doc
Doc
Hello
She puts the phone down and rushes across to turn on the
/' : , The images are confusing, with the rapid pans and temporary loss of focus or light that characterise raw news footage
Doc's Camera weaves amongst a mass of uniformed people, trying to catch clear pictures of-what's been happening
Sirens howl, red emergency lights flash
77 It becomes clear we are looking at the aftermath of a disaster
Or a massacre
The club building looks like a bomb hit it
Smoke and debris litter the street
So do corpses
Some of the dead bodies are simply dead bodies
Others - glimpsed fleetingly and tantalizingly as Doc is jostled and bustled - seem to be mutilated decoratively
In fact they bear hideous similarities to the artworks that used to grace the club: armless torsos wrapped in barbed wire; flayed limbs with machinery inside instead of muscle
(off) Judas Priest
Will you look at
Suddenly, the images are blocked by a very   pushing at the camera and talking directly into it
Move it
Now
No pictures
(off) -
don't give a shit
Move it or lose it
, ' on Joey's face as she reacts in horror to what she is seeing
( with Doc's footage) Oh my God, it's happening
Doc's camera pans around the area, past rubbernecking crowds, past shadowed alleys, past Police cars and ambulances vehicles and then whips back to an alley in the distance
thought
what's
think there's something up there
Joey's eyes widen in horror as she speaks uselessly to the screen
78 No
No, Doc, don't
don't
The hubbub and noise has died away
Doc's camera is advancing up a very dimly-lit alley
Hardly any detail can be seen
The camera creeps forward
forward
forward
Then suddenly a barely-glimpsed movement very close to the side and the camera swings wildly toward it
Shit
What was
The face of Pinhead, almost lost to the darkness of the alley, is glimpsed on the screen as it looms toward the lens
The image disappears to darkness, over which Doc's  of mortal terror and agony can be heard before the blackness is suddenly replaced by a station identification card and then a very harried anchorperson at a studio desk
Well, we've
er
yes, we've temporarily lost our pictures there and and
Joey has her hands at her mouth in horror
Doc
Joey leaps to her feet, grabs the box from the , and stares at it in her hand
- /    ' / Joey's hands grip her steering-wheel tightly
Her face is drawn and grim
The Box is on the seat beside her
She is driving very fast
She has to slam on the brakes at a red light
She pounds at the dashboard in frustration
'mon
'mon
79 on a terrified face
The face belongs to , a 20 year old runner for a drug gang
His head is pressed tight against a brick wall
His nose is bleeding and his eye is red and ready to bruise
'll get it

fist slams into Eddie's face
- An alley
Eddie is being held against the wall by two uniformed , one in his 40's, one in his 20's
The elder cop has just punched Eddie in the face
Don't promise me shit, you little fuck
You know what your promise is worth to me
Huh
Fifty per cent of fuck-all
Give him the money, Eddie
don't
big back-handed slap from the Elder Cop
Give him the money, Eddie
Just listen to me, Please
The Elder Cop gut-punches him and Eddie doubles up
'm done listening, shit-brain
Where you been all day
They shut the school
Kindergarten closed
No customers
Huh
Huh
Give him the money, Eddie
Tell ya, 'm gonna puke if he beats on you any more
Just give him the
The Younger Cop pauses, looking beyond them down the alley as a long black shadow falls over them
80 money
What the
The Elder Cop, at the change in his partner's tone, looks up
Standing in the center of the alley at its far end, light coming from behind him so that he is unclear, is Pinhead
(Calm
Expecting obedience) You, fuckoff
He turns back to Eddie
Get your head outta your stinkin' ass and look at me, boy
(still looking down alley) Hey
Pinhead is moving up the alley towards the action
Elder Cop shoves Eddie away
(to Eddie) Get lost
Eddie doesn't waste time with questions
He's gone
The Cops straighten up and start walking to meet Pinhead
Pinhead advances- still in the shadows, still just a black shape moving forward
have the distinct impression  told you to fuckoff
Unless  miss my guess, you've just disobeyed an officer of the law
Pinhead emerges into the (dim) light in the alley
am the Law
Cops halt in shock at this awesome presence, both of them instinctively drawing their guns
And both instinctively beginning to back up
You're one butt-ugly son of a bitch and you're about to dead meat
81 am the son of eternal night and you are about to discover pain has no ending
Well, that's enough of a direct threat for any officer of the law
Both cops fire their guns
Once
Twice
Three times
Pinhead keeps walking
He spits out the bullets that his body has absorbed
Oh shh
They empty their guns - useless - and then they turn and run down the alley
And then stop short
There is a sudden wall of impenetrable blackness in front of them as if the world simply comes to a stop four yards from their feet
The cops turn, terrified, to look back
Instinctively, they spread apart - each walking near to opposite walls
The younger cop is standing beneath a fire escape
He glances up as if he might be able to jump up to safety
No
Too high
Pinhead's head flicks upward as if in a gesture of command
Suddenly, the Fire escape ladder zooms downward with impossible speed and force
The Younger Cop doesn't even have time to scream
The ladder smashes right through his body, impaling him
His corpse stands there twitching and shuddering, wrapped around the ladder
Elder Cop stares in terror at his partner's fate
No
No
No
No
No
No
Pinhead stands very still and speaks very calmly
Curb your tongue
The Elder Cop's body starts to move involuntarily
His movements are jerky and spasmodic as if his mind is trying to fight what his body is trying to do
Pinhead's head moves through various positions
His face is calm, showing no particular pleasure at what he is doing but only a fascinated concentration as if experimenting with new- found skills
82 The Elder Copts shaking puppet-like hands draw his handcuffs from his belt
His eyes show terror
Everything else is beyond his control
He raises the cuffs to head level and springs one of them open
His mouth suddenly jerks open and his tongue protrudes
The fear in his eyes increases
He moves the open cuff over his tongue
He's making panicked moaning noises as if trying to scream
He drives the cuff closed right through his tongue
And  (as best he can)
Pinhead looks beyond the Cop to the wall of blackness and makes another commanding gesture with his head
Chain flies from the darkness and wraps itself around the other cuff
The chain pulls taut and then suddenly retracts into the darkness, hauling the Cop off his feet and dragging him along the alley into the blackness
The Cop screams and moans all the way until he is enveloped into the darkness and then the sounds suddenly stop dead
, Paramedic is attempting to hold Joey back
In the distance behind them is the wreckage of the club
They are standing near the alley into which Doc's camera disappeared
But  have to see him
'm his friend
Lady, trust me
You really don't want to go
But Joey has slipped past his obstructing arm and runs on into the alley
And pulls to a horrified stop
No
- ' 83 The scene is well-lit by Police emergency lights
It is taped off by yellow    banners
Paramedics and cops stand around in various states of shock or disgust
In the middle of it all is Doc
Quite dead
The body is kneeling up, its cold hands resting on its lap and holding its severed head which stares up at its shoulders
The camera has been shoved deep between the corpse's shoulder blades and is angled down as if filming its dead face
on Joey's devastated face
- An establishing shot of a church at the top of a small hill
- The Church is in semi-darkness
Some candles at an offertory, some others on an altar, provide the only light
On the very front pew a  sits, head bent low in prayer
The Priest is a young man
Probably a good man
We're not really going to have the time to find out
shadow seems to pass over the Priest's bowed head
At first, it seems he hasn't noticed
Then he looks up, a little puzzled
He looks to his right, his left, then shifts in the pew to look back along the central aisle
There are rows and rows of empty pews and, in the distance, the Church door
which is ajar
The Priest stands, walks to the start of the aisle, and looks back along it again
(calling down aisle) Is there anyone there
Hello
Silence
beat
The Priest looks puzzled
We see his mind work
He's looked right, looked left, looked down
How about
He turns right round to face the altar
' 84 To the Priest, it's an image of nightmarish blasphemy
Even to us heathens, it's pretty shocking; Pinhead in all his dark glory is standing behind the altar
How dare you
It gets worse
Pinhead, staring at the Priest all the while, reaches his hand to the back of his head and begins to extract one of the pins from his skull
The pin is horribly long and, sickeningly, the last few inches aren't metal at all but some kind of infernal worm - dark, slimy, and befanged
Pinhead presses the worm against his palm and it instantly burrows through his flesh pulling its pin-tail behind it
He repeats the operation with the other palm
He turns his palms out to show the Priest in a blasphemous parody of Christ's stigmata
am the Way
The Priest rushes up to the altar to Pinhead
You'll burn in Hell for this
The Priest reaches him
Pinhead's hand is on his throat instantly, squeezing silence from him
Burn
What a limited imagination
The choking Priest kicks and struggles as Pinhead forces him to his knees before him
Pinhead towers over the Priest
He smiles
With his free hand he gouges out a piece of his own flesh from the decorative wounds on his chest
He holds the bloody piece of meat up
This is my body
This is my blood
Happy are they who come to my supper
Pinhead shoves the disgusting lump of blue and bloody flesh into the Priest's aghast mouth
Pinhead flings the priest away from him
85 The Priest lands heavily on the floor
Pinhead walks forward, smashing the altar aside
All the candles flicker as if an unheard wind is blowing through the Church
Pinhead walks up the aisle toward the semi-conscious Priest
And all the candles go out
/   ' / Joey is driving again
And this time she's not even stopping at red lights
She steams across junctions, leaving cars swerving and horns honking in her wake
Something catches her eye and she throws a glance to her side
(appalled) Oh God
' () Up a side street, atop a hill, is the Inner-city Church
It's on fire
Joey swings the car up the hill
- : Joey getting out of the car nearer the burning church
Off to her side is a smaller building, the Church Hall
Joey shakes her head at the desecration
She has no doubt who's responsible
Having fun en route, you bastard
Suddenly, a  noise from behind her
Joey freezes in terror then slowly - very slowly - turns round
'  - The Priest - now mercifully dead - is crucified against the side wall of the smaller building
Pinhead's nails protrude from his palms and his ankles
86 of   of Joey's car tearing through the darkness heading back to her apartment
, ' Joey rushes down the corridor to her apartment door, hurriedly turns the lock and rushes in
, ' Joey closes her door and switches on the light
The mood is suddenly different after the frenzied drive across town
It's very still, very slow, very quiet
Perhaps it's too quiet:  Joey moves into the room slowly, clutching the Box in her hands and glancing round
Her manner makes the mood suddenly creepy
Is the monster already in the house
Very slowly, very carefully, Joey begins to move round her apartment
Hardly breathing, making no sudden movements, she checks her doors
The kitchen
empty
The bedroom
empty
The bathroom
empty
Joey stands back in the center of her main room, facing out to her big picture window
Slowly, she lets out a big breath and then draws an equally slow one in
Maybe it's alright
maybe the monster isn't here
maybe
Magically, eerily, slowly, the Box begins to rise from Joey's hand
Her eyes stare in horror as it ascends through the air
Oh shit
Maybe there's one place she hasn't checked
Swallowing nervously, Joey tilts her head up and back, her eyes rising up in their sockets
The camera tilts low
low
lower
taking in a wider view of the room and its ceiling and the ascending Box
And the audience screams
Like a spider or a lizard, Pinhead is flat against the ceiling, arms stretched out for balance, his face staring down at Joey
Joey throws her hands to her mouth and screams
87 Pinhead, angling down feet first, floats elegantly to the floor to stand facing Joey
The Box lands in one of his outstretched hands
He holds it out to show Joey
and then suddenly closes his powerful hand on it, apparently crushing it
He flings the remnants from him and they land on Joey's floor - Chunks and splinters of wood, whirring and spinning machinery of gold and silver, and scores of tiny writhing worms
No
Watch
Thanks to the miracles of trick photography, the remnants suddenly come back together and reassemble themselves into the Box which sits there intact on the floor
The Box can't be destroyed
Like pain or the poor, it is always with us
But as long as  have it, no-one can open it
Now come here and die
You have friends in Hell waiting to greet you
Joey begins to back across the room toward her window
You'll have to come and get me, you ugly bastard
Spirited
Good
'll enjoy making you bleed
'll enjoy making you enjoy it
Pinhead starts across the room
Joey looks at her window
It's the normal view
with the normal seven-story drop
Pinhead closes
She bites her lip, goes for it: in a literal and metaphorical leap of faith she runs headlong at the window and jumps at it
The window shatters
Pinhead's arm reaches out after Joey as if to grab her and pull her back
88 - shows his arm entering the shattered window and also shows the night-time cityscape beyond the window
What it doesn't show is the front of the monster's arm
That's somewhere else
on Pinhead's arm, still clutching at the air
Suddenly, a khaki-uniformed arm moves into shot and grasps Pinhead's hand, arm-wrestling style
(  /) Elliott literally pulls Pinhead through from one reality to another - we see parts of the monster appearing and disappearing in front of the Hut wall as if glimpsed through tears in reality
It's like a tug-of-war which Elliott wins - Suddenly Pinhead's there on the floor of the Quonset hut
And his other self - Elliott - still has hold of his hand
Pinhead throws a glance around the Hut
He recognizes it
and the frozen figure at the top end perched before the Box
(furious rage) Aahhhh
Joey
Back to the wall, quickly
Joey runs around then to the far wall - just in time because now the pyrotechnics start
Elliott tightens his grip and (with a nice series of - of these two alternative selves) the life-forces of Elliott and Pinhead begin to erupt
begins to play over both their bodies
It's apparently agonizing, both figures arching with the pain, both faces grimacing
Joey watches, wincing in sympathetic agony
Elliott
No
What about you
Where will you be
Elliott grunts his answer through the agony
89 Back with the damned
No more hope of heaven
But  drag this monster back with me
You stupid interfering foo
- , , The essences of Pinhead and Elliott - drawn from their bodies as sweeping, glowing, spitting arcs of   - crackle in the air of the Hut like a miniature electrical storm
Until they suddenly lock together in one more powerful arc which flies at the body of the seated Officer and disappears inside him in a
And suddenly, as vision returns, there is only the seated officer   (and, at the far end of the room, Joey)
And, almost as suddenly, the frozen scene comes to life; The radio near the camp bed is playing
bead of sweat falls down the Officer's face as he reaches forward to pick up the Box
The Officer, apparently completely unaware of Joey's presence, begins to work the Box
As the process works through, we 1)  The Officer's hands and the movements of the Box here in the Hut in 1921
2)    movements of the Box back on the floor of Joey's apartment in 1992
Moving on its own, linked across the years to its earlier self
3)  Joey watching the movements in the Hut
Elliott
Elliott
You can't hear me, can you
It's 1921
'm not really here
Suddenly, small patterns of   arc across the Box, shocking the Officer who drops the Box and then stares in shock and fascination as
On the floor, the box begins to open
The Officer kneels up and leans over the Box
90 And the chains fly
Shooting up from within and hooking themselves cruelly into the Officer's face and chest
the Officer's face, howling in agony
Joey's face, sobbing in distress
She throws up her hands to hide the unbearable sight from herself and, when she lowers them,
, ' she's back in her room
Alone
Window intact
Normal view
Joey stares around, her face a mix of sadness and relief
The mood now is very down, post-cataclysmic, post-adventure
Joey takes a deep slow breath and crosses the room toward the kitchen door
She crosses the floor without glancing down at it
Why should she
Everything's over
But we notice, even if she doesn't, that the Box is no longer there
But we hardly have time to register this before
Joey opens the kitchen door
(
) Pinhead is framed in the doorway
Behind him, instead of her kitchen, is the black space of Hell - like the Torture Rooms in  and , it is full of shadowy pillars and chains
Oh, no kiss of welcome after 70 years
Joey backs away, shaking her head in shocked denial
Pinhead moves forward, very leisurely
This will be so good, Joey
You loved him, didn't you
can feel him inside, weeping for you
He can watch through the centuries as we discover the things that make you whimper
Joey's mood breaks and she turns and rushes for her front door
She reaches it, throws it open
and screams
91 Monroe is in the doorway - but he's only just recognizable
He's now a  - blue-skinned, scarred, mutilated, and decorated with metal and leather
You never met, did you
This was Monroe
Have you seen what they did to me
Have you seen what they did
You interfering little whore
The  Cenobite moves into the room
Joey, now near hysteria, rushes across the room again to the one remaining door - her bedroom
She throws that one open
And Terri, the new  , walks out at her
She has the open Box in her hand and several cigarette protruding from different holes in her cheek and face
Terri
Oh no
Oh, go on
Have one
Fuck it
You think you're going to live forever
Pinhead and  are advancing across the room toward Joey and Terri
Joey only has seconds to act
Wanna light, you bitch
Joey pulls her father's Zippo from her pocket and sparks it up as she swings it through the air close to Terri's face
huge  shoots out of the Zippo (as in the earlier scene) and scours across Terri's face
Terri howls in terror, throws her hands to her face
and the Box flies from her hands
Joey catches it, spins it, closes it
An arc of   zaps across to Terri and she's gone
Still in one movement, swinging on her heels, Joey twists the box again
And another Arc of  zaps  away
92 Joey completes her turn
She's facing Pinhead
She holds the Box before her like a weapon
and she's got the monster in her sights
Wait
His hands are raised palms out
He's stopped advancing
Joey holds the Box ready, breathing heavy, waiting
You can send me back
But why
can help you, Joey
can give you what you want
You'll never know what  want
(Despite what she's said, we see Joey's face register every word of Pinhead's reply, every nuance, every promise
) Respect
Power
You and  can put your name on the World's lips, your face on it's screens
Camera  closer to the Box in Joey's hands as Pinhead speaks
Closer and closer until it's side fills the screen
- ' on the face of the Box, still filling the screen
to reveal that the Box is mounted on a plinth within a glass bell-jar
continues
The bell-jar stands on a tall thin wooden sculpture stand
continues
The stand is next to a large impressive desk in an even larger even more impressive office
And seated behind the desk is
well, we can't really call her Joey - she's far too impressive for that
is Ms
Joanne Summerskill
Her hair is different
Her make-up is different
Her clothes are different
Everything about this woman speaks of power and sophistication
