' Written by Danilo Bach rev 1st draft July 30, 1986 -    - The sparkling waters
The chirping spring day
We are on an isolated stretch of country shore , and a quiet, sheltered island is visible distantly across the Sound
There is asense of anticipation, excitement
can be heard
is the  of a , and a group of college kids wait just o
s
On-screen, however, for the moment, a proper, sweet-faced young  faces the camera and -- reluctantly, under the urging of her friend behind the video lens - - sets the scene
() Hi
My name is Mary 'Reilly 'Toole 'Shea and
over there is the island my friend Muffy owns
It's spring break
and she's invited us over for the weekend, and we're waiting for the ferry now to take us there
(blushing, mortified to cameraman) don't know what else to say
(' ) Tell us something about yourself
Something about myself
Oh, Gee
(composing herself, earnestly) Well,  want to work with handicapped children
My parents are my best Friends
Next semester  start convent school, and
fuck on the first date
her friends explode with
Brassy former deb gives us a big, wet wink, dropping the act
/ April Fool
' Whoo
Outrageous woman
Nikki, you are my kind o' gal
He    over to -- a pretty, unaffected, natural beauty, bright and very much aware
' 'mon, Kit, how about you
Kit waves him off, laughing in spite of herself
She's got nothing to say
Pass
' 'mon , Arch
Skip
He  over to the other two college boys on the dock here - , a big, good-natured, easygoing  jock (rugby and crew); and , Mr
Preppy, the perfect image of the lazy spoiled, indulged, and reckless upper-crust kid
Skip also happens to be Muffy's cousin
(ponders it with due consideration) Yeah, sure
fuck on the first date
Skip cracks up
Arch's laughter follows
(
) Where's Rob
Chaz - the camera back to Kit, following the action
' (teasing, with innuendo) Yeah, Kit, where is he
(
) ( ) Oh, Kit
Concerned, Kit keeps her humor anyway, waving the lens away again
Oh, c'mon, Chaz, give me some room, will you
He does, finally shutting down the videopak
The image reverts to again
(looks at her, persisting) Well
-   - : The driver -- a still great-looking, turned-out Fairfield County-type -- and the passenger,   a cleancut, goodlooking, 20 year old public school grad sit in uncomfortable silence on opposite ends of the front seat
(gestures, awkwardly) Here'll be fine, thanks
- The Volvo wagon pulls over
Rob drags out his daypack, too
() Thanks
for the lift,  mean
(smiles, no reason for disappointment) It was a real lift for me, too, hon
late model Detroit sedan slows at the intersection, turning off the highway to take the junction in the direction Rob is going
road sign indicates: "   " in another direction
Rob hefts his gear, hurrying to flag the sedan
The Volvo wagon continues on, braking for the next undergraduate male hitchhiking down the road
-
- a wall calendar
reaches  , tearing off "" to begin ""
, the middle-aged housekeeper and offseason caretaker for the house
With her overcoat and purse on one arm, she drops the "" calendar page in a wastebasket, then crosses to the pantry where a door and wooden steps lead down to the basement
() The rooms are all in order, double- and triple-checked, and 'm on my way
She hears a  from down below
- drags a woman's body across the floor
The arm comes off in her hand
Shit
' Need any help down there
Clara comes clopping down the steps
Muffy turns, the mannequin's arm still in her hand
Old workclothes and a head kerchief take the place of Muffy's normally impeccable prep Seven Sisters outfit (including the regulation penny loafers) in all this dust
Early 20's, pretty in an off-beat sort of way, Muffy is every inch a blue-blood
(puffing with the effort) No, Clara, thanks
Just trying some last minute straightening down here
god,  don't think 've ever worked so hard in my life
Sure you don't want me to stay
There's nobody gonna be around here to help till first ferry back Monday, y'know
(continuing with her work) Nope, you're a peach, Clara
But this one's mine
told my father 'd do it, and  will
My way
don't want him to have any excuses
(dubiously , turning to go) All right, then
Have a nice party
(a buoyant laugh) Nice
It has to be better than nice
it's gotta be bloody unforgettable
Clara climbs the stairs
Good luck
() Bye, Clara
See you Monday
Soon there's the upstairs  of the kitchen door closing behind Clara
Muffy finally props the mannequin, clearing away the remaining clutter
She goes to open a basement window for ventilation
It is a ground-level transom, hinged at the top
Through it Clara is visible departing the grounds
Then Muffy hears a
She turns, hesitating, and follows the sounds
Part of the basement, an old washroom and more, with tub, slop sink and large incinerator
Muffy enters, pulling the chain on the bare, overhead bulb
It illuminates the room, and the tub underneath -- slightly rusty at the drain, but otherwise spotless -- and the slowly dripping faucet
-  - , the videocameraman and the only member of the group we haven't seen till now, is the first to spot the ferry approaching
Here she comes
He's a real hi-tech freak and Ivy League wiseass, a free spirit in neo-punk neck curl and button-down shirt
He shoulders his lightweight videopak again, taping it
Arch and Skip watch with him from the end of the pier
But Kit and Nikki, waiting nearer the office, are distracted by the  of an arriving car
- It's not Rob, though
It's , another newcomer
She pulls her car next to the others in the gravel lot behind the landing office and - gets out quickly, dragging a hefty suitcase out of the back seat
She is an unfamiliar face to Kit and Nikki --a shy, earnest, small-town girl, overdressed for the occasion
() Hi
is this the ferry to the St
John house
Any second now
Oh, thank goodness
didn't know if  was on the right road
Kit smiles welcome, lending a hand as Nan struggles the bag up the ramp
Hi
Kit Graham
Nikki Brashears
Nan Youngblood
(needling, about the suitcase) Planning on staying a while
(flushes, embarrassed) Oh, no
just some work for finals, when we get back
you don't know how far behind  am
Arch outhustles Chaz for her bag
Her simple attractiveness exerts an appeal
Hi
Arch Cummings
've seen you around
Jewett Hall, right
Chaz Vyshinsky
You got great legs
(pointed1y, reminds him) Chaz, Arch already has her bag
Meaning, Chaz is Nikki's man, especially for this weekend
(volunteering, happily) Well,  only met Muffy this term in Drama Society
volunteered to do their costumes
like to sew
Did you see her in Ghosts
She's so talented
She was wonderful
(to Nan, approvingly; in greeting) Congratulations, on finding your way
The landing , the ferry touches down
They look up
() Stand clear
The large, raw-boned  holds open the wooden stile for the one and only passenger from the island  Clara -- to disembark
Clara passes them , giving first Skip and then the others a look, shaking her head in sad appraisal
(cont
) () Ok, let's go
It's not the friendliest greeting in the world
The ferryman keeps the stile open for them to board singly
There is also a younger assistant on board -- , a pleasant, openfaced townie in his 20s
(cont
) To the rear
Outa the operator's way
Nikki clutches at Skip's arm
( -) This is it
No going back
Trapped for days on an island where men are men, and women oughta know better
( ) Try to control yourself, Sister 'Toole
( ) You could tie me in chains
Chaz boards, passing Buck, the assistant
(a low whisper) Your fly's open, and your Hostess Twinkie's hanging out
The assistant gapes, falling for it, groping his fly
Which is closed, of course
He looks up, grinning
Chaz kisses him on the cheek, winks and moves on
Sh -i-i-t
Kit is hanging back on the dock
Come on if you're coming
() Excuse me
But we're still waiting for somebody -- () It's Friday
My last run of the week
don't get paid overtime
But you've got to wait
They said it's the only way over
If he misses this
Arch  loudly, seeing and alerting them
- late model Detroit sedan (the one we saw earlier turning off the highway) pulls to a fast stop in the lot
Rob hurries out; a comes up from the group on the ferry
Kit closes her eyes in relief
Rob comes hurrying up the ramp
followed closely by  '' ,
Wait up
Harvey is the driver of the sedan, and after he carefully locks up, he comes running with his bag, too
He is a rangy, straight-arrow Ivy League farmboy from the Border South, and he's the last of Muffy's invited guests
He also, somewhat incongruously, sports a Bruce Springsteen badge
(to Kit, kissing her) Sorry
Nik, Chaz
(to Skip and Nan whom he doesn't know) Rob Ferris
They return greetings
(  ) Hi
Harvey 'Hal' Edison, Jr
, but please call me Hal
Only my folks call me Harve
and  can't stand it
Boy, this sure is a pretty spot
Stylistically, he's a Martian
Chaz stares at him
You're friends with
Muffy St
John
() Sure am
We sit together in Econ 345
let her copy my marginal utility curves
get it
That's a joke
Preppy Skip adds his greeting
(an ironical nod) Harve
(correcting him, blithely) Hal
(noticing interest his badge) Springsteen, he's still the Boss
() Ok, c'mon,  don't have all day
He slams the stile down after Harvey, the last to board, and gets busy with the stubborn motor
His assistant helps
Chaz tapes
(enthusiastically, putting down his fear) all buddies
Except for Skip and Nan
Them we just met
() But we will be
( ) Watch what you say around him, though
He's Muffy's cousin
(tickled, to Skip) No kiddin'
Distant
Over the horizon
Otherwise,  wouldn't be invited
(frowns, tellingly) Old money never mixes family with friends
This is true
For as long as 've known her
() To protect her family,  guess
() To keep her friends
He turns to Arch, holds up his hand, and , a switchblade opens into the lens
(cont
) Choose your weapons, big guy
(nervously, a laugh) Hey, what's this
You up for a game of stretch
(still taping, to Skip) Your fly's open
Eat it
(undaunted, to Rob) Your fly's open
() Ok, so don't believe me
He keeps the tape rolling
Rob discreetly looks down
His fly is open
Kit looks at him dubiously
Rob zips
Chaz beams, getting it all for posterity
The engine finally engages
The ferry lurches
(smiles weakly to Kit) We're off
They are indeed
-   - The ferry pulls away from the mainland
- The sturdy, barge like ship craft makes progress
The Ferryman and Buck remain at the stern
- As Skip's knife flies  , it bites into the boards and holds
at their game
Arch stretches, can't reach the knife, and topples over
Skip hoots triumphantly
First round, the champ
Nikki, much to her chagrin, finds herself the object of Harvey's attentions
'know what  find amazin'
Muffy's her real name
mean, 'm Harvey, but they call me Hal, so  thought, 'Muffy', it must stand for something
Muffin
Muffers, Moffo, Muff-child , Muffin' stuff, the Muffster
() bet you're her oldest friend
() Actually, she's three months older than  am
You know what  mean
Harvey
are you planning a career in politics when you grow up
've given it some thought
Why
Oh, just a hunch
First, though, 'm hopin' to interview with her daddy's company, Southern Regional Sales, next year before graduation
'know, he's worth more'n 50 mill over the counter
She just stares at him
- digging into the deck again
(
) Jesus
and The knife is at an impossible distance
() Go for it, big fella
Arch swallows his pride and makes a hopeless attempt
fastens onto Nan, immersed in one of her books
He carries his own
(sitting beside her) Whatcha readin'
Milton
Paradise Lost
For Professor Russo's course on the English epic
It's a shame
It's a dying form
Not too many people read it nowadays, even in college
What's yours
( ) Suck and fuck
Naked bodies writhing in heat
Women with their tongues sticking out in desparate desire
Nan tries to control her reaction to his stack of graphic pornographic video catalogues and magazines
() The origins of American pornographic film
'm taking an independent study this term
(the passion and commitment show) My advisor's really behind me on it
We're not gonna be sheltered college kids all our lives
Someday 'm gonna have kids -- you're gonna have kids  and someday that kid's gonna come up to me and say, 'God, Dad, porn's really a major part of our lives
You were there, how'd it get started
'  wanna be able to answer their questions
() Besides, it's research  can do by myself
They keep their voices low
( ) That's not my point -- You don't want me to hitch, you want me to buy a car
, but 'm a state university boy,  don't have the perks like some of you private college kids do
Oh, c'mon, don't pull that
Rob just drops his arms in frustration
(cont
) mean, it may show something about your attitude toward me, always being late
Kit
Arch's voice interrupts
' (annoyed, loudly, overriding the other conversations) Hey, 'm really not interested anymore -- 'mon, just one more The others look up at the interruption
Arch pushes the knife back into Skip's hand, tired of playing knife- toss
said, enough's enough-- One more try, double or nothing
He flips the knife to Arch, handle first
( ) 'mon, give it a fuckin' rest
He flips it back hard
Something happens
Skip looks up stunned
Arch's voice catches in his throat in horror
Skip stares back, disbelieving, looking down and pulling his hand away from his chest, where the blood begins to seep and the jackknife sticks out, buried hilt-deep between his ribs
() Oh, fuck
Nan screams
Skip stumbles, teetering there at the edge of the ferry
Rob and Chaz leap to their feet
The ferrymen both look up in disbelief
Arch steps forward to help
But Skip, weaving, topples and splashes overboard
He goes under
(panicked, hurrying to the side) 'll get him, 'll get him
But he stops just at the edge of the ferry, immobilized by fear
Rob rushes forward, with Chaz in reserve, pulling Arch out of the way
But Buck, the assistant ferryman, pre-empts them all, diving in
Arch, frozen, watches from the deck with the others
Buck resurfaces, but without any sign of Skip
Rob doesn't wait any longer
He pulls off his shoes and dives in
Chaz gets ready to follow suit
The panic mounts
Suddenly: ' Hi, this what you're looking for
; Skip pulls himself up, dripping, on the other side of the ferry
He holds up the knife -- and the padded sash beneath his shirt he used to imbed the knife -- and grins from ear to ear
The others stare, totally freaked
Arch lets go, jumping in the air
Rob and Buck surface, to see as well
We got 'em
Whoo-ee, did we nail 'em
(as it dawns, to Skip) April Fools
you crazy jerks
You crazy motherfuckin' jerks
somebody could've gotten hurt out there
Relief descends
Rob isn't laughing
But nobody's more impressed than assistant Buck, still treading water
() ---- You maniacs
you almost gave us a heart attack
Kit glowers at them and gives Rob a hand to get out
( ) Well, at least we don't go in for this your-shoelaceis-untied crap
(dripping, to Arch and Skip) owe you one
(smiles, to Buck in the water) How's it goin' out there
That was great
was really counting on these other turkeys to save my ass
Oh, too bad
Skip extends a hand to Buck to help him out
Sorry about that
But Buck's in no hurry
The ferryman steps forward
(unamused, to Buck) Ok, c'mon, get out
They are approaching the landing dock on the island
(
) (to Buck, gruffly) 'mon 'm gonna need some help here
Buck obeys, but his way, enjoying it, ducking under the craft to swim to the other side to help
() And watch out for the wire
Too late
There's a sickening   The young assistant suddenly breaks the surface qf the water, panicked and stunned, gasping for air
It happens too fast for any of them to do anything
Buck thrashes, dazed, off-balance, falling back into the path of the ferry as it glides toward the landing
Buck, look out-- ( ) Oh, shit
The ferryman grabs the controls, but it can't help
The ferry, unstoppable, plows into Buck, pinning him against one of the piers
Buck screams
Buck
The ferryman rushes forward to help
For a moment the others are spared the horror of it as the Ferryman's back blocks their view
But then Buck, thrashing in the water, tears himself, loose, screaming and bobbing
up, his head and torso covered in blood, the side of his face and his shoulder hideously deformed
It is awful
It is ghastly
And it is unforgettable
( ) Oh, god
-  - , the middle-aged township constable, hears the cries and the screams
He drops what he's doing in his outboard and comes running
-  - The ferryman jumps into the shallow water, pulling Buck onto shore
Rob, Chaz and Arch jump after to help, but the ferryman pushes them angrily away
Get away from him
Buck is hysterical
The gashes of torn flesh seem to drip from his skull
Seeing Rob and the others, he screams, lunging vainly at them in agony
They did it
them
( ) Easy Buck
it's
There's time for Later
easy
But it's hard for him to restrain his own rage
Constable Potter arrives, throwing the ferryman a towel to use
The ferryman catches it, pressing it against Buck's torn face
One maddened, glaring eye still stares out hideously at the group
( ) Get him to the hospital, Cal
Take my boat
He helps the ferryman lift Buck
But the powerful ferryman needs no further help, carrying Buck to the Constable's motorboat moored nearby, laying Buck in, untying the line and pulling the motor to life
Buck continues to shriek, terrifyingly
The ferryman cast one last glance back
The  of the motorboat fades away
Potter turns back to the stunned group, eyeing them
All right
Let's have it
'   - Muffy drives up
She slows, seeing, through the windshield the somber scene at the pier
her friends in troubled conversation with Constable Potter
- Muffy gets out, parking the new van beside an old island pick-up which is kept at the dock
She's clean, and dressed in her more usual preppy garb
She approaches
What's going on
Sam
what's wrong
( ) Tricks
Pranks
Better ask your friends
Buck's been hurt
'Cal just took him on over to the mainland
Just lucky  was here
She returns his stare in dread silence
He boards the ferry
(
) came over to check on a report of some unauthorized activity in the area
Your dad around
She startles, the question 50 unanticipated
No, he's in Sutton Place
Why
No word from him, or anybody else
( ) No
He tries the engine
Nothing
Just like  thought
Burned out
Worthless
He steps back onto the shore
(
) 'll have to borrow your outboard to get back to shore
We keep all the keys on the board in the kitchen, but think there's an extra one underneath the cushion there
She points to the boat seat
Potter is much obliged
- (to the others, sternly) 'm glad you're stuck here, all o' you
If there's anvthin' else, or anything happens to Buck
want to know where to find you
The van moves slowly along a narrow road through the forest
From what we can see of its occupants, the mood is pretty grim
Behind it, the old island pick-up truck follows
- Rob drives with Kit and Skip beside him in the cab
Nobody says anything
Skip is off somewhere in his own private hell
Finally he reaches over to roll down his window, but the handle rotates uselessly in his grip
These goddamn windows
He starts banging violently on the door, on the window
They've never been fixed
Look, Skip, it wasn't your fault
It was an accident
You didn't know
() Sure
He leaves off his banging
Pause
() What a way to start a weekend, huh
Muffy
Nothing bad ever happens to her
It is a truly grand affair, two stories at least, rambling and picture-perfect with extensive tended grounds, garage, and outbuildings
Muffy gets out first, hopping around to the back to open the rear van gate for the bags
Nan beholds the house for the first time
() Oh; Muffy
Rob pulls the pick-up right behind them
- As they come in with their bags
Well, there's an awful lot to be done with this place
You sound as if you own it
She helps with bags, shepherding them on ahead
will, if all goes well
Next month when  turn 21
It's my first- stage inheritance
() First stage
What's your second
() Texas
You might be talking to your future boss, Harve
Mom,  am home
They all look to see him standing in the entrance to the living room
as they follow Chaz into the room
series of picture windows give a spectacular view of the sound
Yeah,  could get real used to this
We used to spend our summers here before my mother died
() This is a very special place to me
It's like a dream
On a clear day you can see the Kennedys
' (from the dining room) Wow, look at this
The others enter to see what Chaz's shout is all about
Chaz stands before a large, beautifully polished dining table that is set for each of them -- each place carefully marked with a name card and a Ken or Barbie doll with the person's name on it
The settings themselves are idiomatic and economical -- plastic spoon-and-fork combination sets and paper cups, plates, napkins, etc
, (in mock awe) Look
Our very own place settings
with our very own place cards -- with Ken or Barbie
Outasight
() Just like in Agatha Cristie
(in the spirit) And sporks
() Sporks
And napkins with little Hallmark bunnies
Gee, Muff, you really spared no expense
( ) Why not
How do you think father made all his money
() The old-fashioned way
He inherited it
(meaningfully, with her Barbie) used to have all her outfits
Don't anybody move
Chaz jumps back from the table, whipping out his videocam to record the moment, and panning them all at
their respective places
() One of us in this room
(bellowing a mystery laugh) pulls his wang
He ends the pan on Arch, who gives him the finger
- - dropping onto a hot skillet
Muffy, Nikki and Kit cooking a dinner of hot dogs
baked
if only the choices weren't so limited
God, 'm so ready for a change
Any kind of change
Well, you know, everything they say about older men
It's true
Kit and Nikki stare at her, open-mouthed
Muffy
Like how much older are we talking about
Twenty-six
Add about thirty years
don't believe you, St
John
( ) don't want to hear about this
Come on
It was only a weekend
It's over now
(beat, shrugs) was curious
He wasn't married
() How should  know
Kit and Nikki just drop everything and continue to stare at her
It was quite a weekend
Nikki starts to laugh
Come to daddy
They all start to laugh now, wickedly, conspiratorially
Come sit on daddy's knee, little girl
Nikki falls to the floor in hysterics
My goodness, daddy, what big ( ) what big
teeth you have
The better to eat you with, my dear
- richly paneled room with a fireplace, desk, leather-upholstered chairs and lots of books
door opens and Harvey steps through, looks back over his shoulder and enters
He is just snooping around
He surveys the books, the framed diplomas on the walls along with autographed photos of
presidents and other heads of state
He steps over to the desk, opens a cigar box sitting there, takes out a cigar and slips it into his pocket
- Arch and Chaz are in the back lawn overlooking the sound
They are fooling around with Chaz's camera, maybe clowning a bit
- 'broad veranda which runs along the entire length of the back of the house
Skip and Nan are sitting on the railing, gazing over the sounds
Skip has a drink
(quietly, with deliberation) The poor boy can say, "Fuck you, Dad
'm my own person
" What is his father going to do
Kick him out of the house
Disinherit him
His life won't have changed that much
He's got nothing to lose
His father's love
That's already been lost
Died a long, long time ago
() Skip, you're giving up
You're giving up before you've even gotten started
() Look at how young we all are
How young and foolish and innocent and stupid
Skip raises his glass and gulps down the rest of his drink
- secluded area halfway down between the house and the shore
Rob sits alone on a wooden bench and thinks
the dinner bell sounds
- With bell in hand, Muffy turns and heads back into the house
Chaz and Arch come up onto the porch and follow her in
~ Rob is just coming in from outside as Muffy enters from the kitchen with the hot dogs and beans
Everyone else is standing around the table
Boy, Muff, you sure know how to make a guy look forward to dessert
Please, God, let it be ding dongs
St
John hospitality taken to the extreme
think it's real friendly
Makes me feel right at home
Everyone starts to sit down at his designated place
How friendly will we feel once we've finished with those beans
As soon as her ass hits the seat, she lets slip an outrageous fart
She springs to her feet, her face turning beet red
All conversation stops, each person looking for the guilty party
Nan discreetly sits back down: but again, as soon as her tail meets the chair, another blast escapes her
All eyes are on her as she reaches beneath her and pulls out a whoopee cushion
You guys
Everybody laughs
So it's going to be one of those dinners, huh
Arch is laughing the loudest when suddenly his chair collapses beneath him and he drops sprawling onto the floor
- Skip is searching through the darkened living room for something, while in the adjoining room dinner is proceeding quietly
- - ' as he grabs the salt-shaker and spills some of it out onto the table
He samples a couple of grains
It's the real thing
He starts salting his food
wonder how Buck is doing
Do you think we should call or something
() 'll call later
think we should change the subject
Well, Harvey's got his job interview all figured out, but what about the rest of us
Anybody know what they're going to be doing come graduation
They sit dumbly
Another
Good choice, Arch
can't decide
'd like to go to graduate school in English
love the sound of our language
But 'm afraid there's not much future in it
mean, what are you' supposed to do with a liberal arts major anyway
You fill out a lot of forms, and then some friend of your family gives you a job delivering mail in his corporation
This is really incredible
Look at us
Here we are
privileged, independent, the hope of the future
and most of us still don't know what we're going to do with our lives
() Rob knows
He's going to medical school
Rob looks up from his plate
Kit
() Hey, no shit
You got early acceptance
(reddens, to Kit) We can talk about it some other time
Why
You had your meeting with your counselor, didn't you
() Kit
don't think Rob really wants to talk about it in front of everybody
She gets up from the table and steps over to the sideboard
() No,  don't mind
( ) Why not
We're all friends
() Well, sorta
He said to forget it
Kit looks up in surprise
They all stare, quieting
(
) ( ) He said my grades might be ; but that basically  possess an essential lack of seriousness, and that's what they look for
Oh, shit, him too
That's what my guy said
An'  said, you're kidding
How can anybody be serious about anything when some moron can steal a bomb or push a button and blow the rest of us right into Mad Max
He wasn't impressed
He's right
That's bullshit on parade
Well fuck you
It sounded good at the time
Muffy turns from the sideboard and sets a tray of champagne glasses in the center of the table
There are eight of them
Each one is filled with a pinkish, bubbly liquid
Everybody reaches for a glass
What is this
Dom Perignon sparkling rose
It smells like Ripple
You've outdone yourself again, St
John
The back screen door slams shut o
s
behind Skip, leaving the house
They look up
Who was that
() Skip
() Can  make a toast
They turn attention toward her, and she stands, emboldened by their acceptance
(
) Well
Someone once said to me to cherish the friends you make in -- cherish all the friends  make
() Because
they'll be the friends you cherish most the rest of your life
So, well, here's to us
here's to my life
because 'm very glad to be here, and to be a part of all of you
Muffy, anything you want to add to that
Why me
Because you're the hostess
Muffy thinks for a moment, then adds
In his "Life of Johnson" James Boswell said, "We cannot tell the precise moment when friendship is formed
As in filling a vessel drop by drop, there is at last a drop which makes it run over; so in a series of kindnesses, there is at last one which makes the heart run over
" Arch has started to make snoring sounds
(cont
) So with this toast may our hearts run over and our friendships be formed
They stand unanimously, raise their glasses in agreement, start to drink and spill it all down the front of their shirts
Dribble glasses
Everybody groans
( ) April Fool
Muffy shows Nikki, the last of them, to her room
Nan says goodnight from her door
Goodnight
Goodnight
Muffy leads Nikki to a narrow, sparse single, popping open the door
Oh, great
Quarantine
() Just holler if you need anything
Another room
() Muffy
Muffy turns back to her
(cont
) (beat, seriously) know you and Arch had something going before  met him
() Arch is sweet, but he's only got two expressions
Collar up and collar down
found that out-- () guess what 'm trying to say is
you always seem to get there first
but this time Chaz is mine,
() What about Hal
' Harvey
Mr
Junior Achievement
Oh please
Muffy returns her smile,continuing down the corridor
'  -  - Arch throws his duffle bag on a bed, delighted
It's a private suite with two beds
Hey, all right
ladies, we are qonna have privacy
He turns his collar up on his polo shirt, then eagerly pushes the two beds together
The other door (to the connecting bathroom) swings open
Arch's face drops as Chaz walks in, lugging his gear
(
) You gotta be kiddin'
(unloading his gear)
Unless Muffy knows something about us we don't
He blows Arch a kiss, pulling the two beds apart again
'  - a match flaring to life
Harvey lighting the cigar he took earlier out of the study
He puffs on it contentedly, imagining himself a man of power
Then he steps over to the bed and opens his suitcase to begin unpacking
(to himself; rehearsing) Don't tell me you've never thought of me in that way, Muffy
felt a spark between us the very first moment we laid eyes on each other
in Econ 345
Why, just think of it, Muffy
with my talent and your
money
He crosses to the closet with his navy blazer
() Why just think of it
Muffers, with my raw
driving talent and your
He opens the closet door
(
) and your
- newspaper , circled in red marker, of a garish car accident is pinned to the inside of the door
He puzzles, taking down the clipping, putting it down on the dresser as he moves there to put away his rolled socks
He opens the top drawer
The same thing
Full of newspaper clippings of awful, fatal car crashes, all circled in the same accusatory red ink
getting nervous
Suddenly, Chaz burst in on him
Harvey turns quickly, shoving the clippings back in the drawer and slamming it shut
They stare at each other for a long, uncomfortable moment
() Wrong room
He ducks back out the door, pulling it quietly closed behind him
- Outside Harvey's door
Chaz sighs, shakes his head, starts to move away when suddenly there is a   o
s
from inside Harvey's room
Chaz turns quickly back to the door, reaches for the handle, stops himself, thinks better of it and moves away again
'  - Nikki steps up to the sink in the adjoining bathroom, turns the faucet and is squirted by a spray of water jetting out of the rigged plumbing
She quickly shuts off the water and just stands for a moment, dripping
trying to control her anger
Like, enough with Muffy's, jokes already
She comes out of the bathroom with a towel, drying her face, and walks to the dresser
She strips off her shirt, pulls open the top dresser drawers and sees
an eyeless black rubber bondage hood and other miscellaneous & accessories
She picks them up in disbelief
'  - Arch, unloading his shaving bag, which mainly contains a 30-day supply of rubbers, opens the medicine cabinet
On its shelf
a kit neatly filled with hypodermic syringes, needles, rubber tubing, razor blades everything you could ever want for fixing
Jesus
- Muffy, on her way down to straighten up, passes Rob and Kit on their way up
Goodnight
'night
' the shower head on the bathroom gushing water
Nan is taking a shower
slowly out of the bathroom and into the bedroom
the shower is turned off
All is quiet
Then, very faintly at first,   something -- it sounds like crying
As it grows gradually louder we realize that it is crying -- a baby crying
Nan appears suddenly in the bathroom doorway
towel is wrapped around her
She listens
The crying is louder now, but muffled -- a baby crying for its mother
It seems to come from a large mahogany wardrobe on the other side of the room
Nan tenses, slowly approaohing, then flinging open the wardrobe door
small cassette recorder plays
The tape runs out
The baby's cries stop
Nan rips out the cassette, and sinks back onto the bed, burying her head in her hands
and '  - Rob and Kit are standing together staring
to see the object of their attention
Hanging on the wall in front of them is a large oil portrait with the eyes out out
Something is moving behind the canvas watching them
Rob steps forward and lifts the painting off the wall
Behind it is an inset bookcase
Sitting on one of the shelves, at the proper height to have lined up with the holes in the portrait, is a child's Felix-the- cat nursery clock
The eyes of the plastic cat move back and forth, like a pendulum marking seconds
- Rob sets the painting on the floor outside their bedroom door, leaning it up against the wall
for a   of the portrait
It looks much creepier with the now vacant eye sockets
'  - They are undressing on opposite sides of the bed
The silence between them is thick enough to be cut with a knife
Kit sits down slowly on the edge of the bed and quietly slips under the covers
Rob gets in on his side
They sit in silence for a moment, making no move to join each other in the middle of the bed
Rob
No answer
You still angry with me
About dinner
No
'm sorry
'm not angry with you
'm just angry
He leans over, turns off the bedside lamp
and the light in the bathroom comes on
Beat
He gets out of bed and crosses to the bathroom, reaches in and turns off the light
and the overhead light comes on
Kit starts to laugh and quickly covers her mouth
Rob walks to the door, turns off the overhead light
and the bedside lamp comes on again
Kit laughs harder, but still tries to stifle it
Rob shoots her a look, then goes and sits on the edge of the bed
He reaches to turn off the bedside lamp again, then thinks better of it and starts to unscrew the bulb instead
(burning his fingers) Ouch
Jesus
Kit can't stop herself any longer
She laughs out loud
Rob perseveres, finally unscrewing the bulb enough to plunge the room into darkness
Silence
Very funny
Kit breaks up laughing again
To her it is funny
And soon Rob is laughing too
He swings his legs up under the covers beside her
- Muffy turns off the last of the lights downstairs, leaving the porch light on for Skip
- Muffy moves through the quiet to her room
Arch grabs her
She jumps
( ) Arch do you know what time it is
Um-hmm
(turning down his collar) Goodnight, Arch
Gently but firmly, she extricates herself, closing the bedroom door behind her
Undaunted, he scuttles down the hall to Rob and Kit's closed door to listen in
He frowns, the slides farther down to Nikki's room, knocks once softly, and enters
Nikki is already occupied, however, with Chaz
She catches Arch's stare, signalling him to get the hell out
Arch valorously steps back, closing the door and returning to try Nan
The light underneath her door flicks off, however
The door is also locked
Arch curses, returning to his large but empty room
He slams the door for everybody's benefit
'  - Muffy, undressing, hears, and smiles
'  - Arch is pacing the bedroom, horny and alone
He gets an idea, goes and rummages through Chaz' stuff and comes up with a video cassette of a porno movie
Carrying -the cassette he crosses to the door and turns the handle
The doorknob comes off in his hand
He throws it down in disgust, goes and sits in a chair and broods
The chair collapses beneath him
- Skip makes his way boldly, carelessly, drunkenly along
Overgrown weeds and tall spring grass choke the path, shadowing his way
He takes one last drink, killing the bottle, and hurls it out into the night
After a long pause there is the distant sound
of the bottle landing in water with a splash
,  - Skip emerges from the overgrowth
The abandoned old structure and its dock squat ahead at water's edge
Beneath the boathouse, floating in the water, is a grungy old skiff covered by a tarp
Skip turns away from the dock, and flicks his lighter among the weeds, finding marijuana growing there
He  with triumph
Something  nearby
He doesn't pay attention, taking out his knife to cull the dried leaves
He cups them in his hand against the wind, douses his lighter, and hurries out onto the dock to the boathouse entrance to prepare his joint
- as Skip enters
It is pitch black in here, and aside from the gentle lapping sounds of water against the pilings down below
, all is still
Skip flips a lightswitch in the darkness and nothing happens
He edges slowly along a wall away from the door
Then he becomes aware of another living presence in the boathouse
It is a slow breathing sound--completely inhuman
Hello
There is no answer, but the breathing continues
Then a sharp rapping sound very near, like a foot striking the wood flooring
Who's there
Pause
No answer
We hear in the darkness the sound of his switchblade clicking open
And then he waits, straining his ears to hear
Finally, Skip reaches into his pocket, puils out his lighter and flicks it on
Something snags him from behind
Skip gasps, helpless, as a thick rope controlled by powerful, shadowed hands tightens around his neck
His knife, dried leaves and lighter cascade to the floor
-  - Only the porch light remains glowing
The house is dark
'  - Rob wakes, hearing the  from Muff's room
Kit, naked against him, wakes too
They hear the muffled cry again
It is not from lovemaking
Rob throws off the covers
- Rob wraps himself with a towel, stepping quickly out to Muffy's door
Everything else is dark and quiet
(hushed, at door) Muffy
No answer
He tries her door, but it's locked tight
beat
Then: (cont
) () Muffy
' () Yes
You
' () Yes
Thank you
He pulls back from the door
(reluctantly, puzzled) well, goodnight
No response
He turns back for his room, catching sight of Chaz, who has come out of Nikki's room, to investigate, too
- Harvey is out on the second floor balcony exercising vigorously
No one else is in evidence until a bedroom window flies open and Nikki, naked from the waist up and believing herself unwatched, leans out and stretches, breathing in the sweet morning air
Then she sees Harvey grinning at her
She quickly covers herself and pulls back inside
Rob and Kit are the first ones down
They enter from the dining room, surprising Muffy at the stove
() Good morning
Muffy turns abruptly, startled
Rob and Kit stop abruptly, too
Muffy is barefooted, dressed in an old, worn chenille robe
Her hair, normally carefully groomed, is unkempt, wild and stringy about her pale face
Talk about unguarded moments
Her present appearance, is the last way one would ever expect to find Muffy St
John
She shrinks back from them with a frightened, apologetic smile
Scrambled eggs bubble in the skillet on the burner
was hungry
She bumps against the stove, backing away
She self-consciously runs a hand through her hair
(cont
) must look a mess
She scuttles out the door to the utility room and the back stairs beyond, leaving the eggs to burn
Arch encounters her, too, as he comes bounding down in his workout shorts
Morning
She backs away from him, scurrying up the stairs
forgot to get dressed
- Arch enters, joining his wonderment to Rob and Kit's
Who made her night
-  - : Arch, Chaz, Harvey and Nikki burst out the door in old clothes, sweats, shorts, whatever -- an unlikely foursome for some informal soccer scrimmaging
(always in search of more players) Where's Skip
That depends on what he's on
Rob and Kit cross their path, heading down to the water in their swimsuits and overshirts
You gotta be kidding
(teasingly, an invitation) Nan
What about it
Nan watches from the porch, book in hand
Oh, no, thanks
() Besides,  thought 'd wait and see what Muffy wanted to do
Arch shrugs and the soccer free-for-all begins in earnest, with special attention given to the interplay between Harvey and Nikki
Up on the porch, Nan finally sees Muffy emerging from the distant tool shed
Muffy is dressed plainly, oddly conventional, with a perceptible sense of disorder about her
She keeps to herself, turning toward the woods beyond, with cutting blade and mushroom basket in hand
Nan puts down her book, hurrying off the porch
But by the timeshe looks up again, Muffy is gone
- Rob and Kit are standing together on the dock
He is dripping wet and covered with goose flesh
She has not been in yet
And while he is vigorously toweling off his arms and chest, trying to get the blood circulating again, she stands behind him with another towel and gently, lovingly dries his back
She finishes and he steps away from her and gazes out across the sound
Rob
What's wrong
Pause
swear it wasn't this cold yesterday
This isn't what she meant, and he knows it
Are you giving up
(turning to her; gently) What about you
What about your future
You're the one with the four point
() maybe it's crazy--you investing so much energy in me
() don't know
'm scared
don't know if  want what Mom and everybody else expects of me
don't want to go to law school
() You've got a great mind only it's not made up
Smiling sadly, he crosses to her, puts his arms around her
Great
Do you realize how perfectly unmatched we are
It's made up about one thing though
Yeah
What's that
She looks up and kisses him softly
Will you feel the same about me a year from now
Two years, five years from now
She takes his hand and leads him down the pier and into the boathouse
- As they come inside
Kit closes the door, and immediately they are in each other's arms
The surging waves swirl beneath them, visible through the shrunken floorboards
Rob and Kit stretch out
All the passion, all the tenderness, all the intensity makes them oblivious to the fact that something is moving on the water below
And when Kit finally opens her eyes to it, Skip's face bulges gruesomely up at her through the slatted floor
Kit screams and scrambles to her feet--Rob completely uncomprehending until he sees it too: Skip's body, pale and bloodied, draped within the grungy skiff passing beneath them on the waves
- By the time he pulls on his swimsuit and comes rushing out with Kit, however, Rob's shock has turned to rage
Skip
You sonofabitch
But there's no response, Skip's body unmoving on the self-powered skiff which continues bobbing out to sea
starts to wonder whether it really is a joke
He hurries forward, plunging 'into the water to reach the boat
Skip
Skip
But it's too far and getting farther, and the waves are too strong
- Rob and Kit come struggling up the path
Chaz trains his videopak on them from the porch
He, Arch, Harvey and Nikki unwind with beer and sandwiches after their sweaty workout
(commentary while he tapes) Respectable young Quaker couple returning after quiet afternoon of nonviolent sex
( ) Well, how was it
Where's Skip
Anybody seen him
Who wants to know
Goddammit, can't you give me a straight answer
They sit up with the force
Nan comes out on the porch, hearing
() We saw him
on a boat
drifting by the pier
He wasn't movinq
He looked dead
unless he was joking
Well, if it was Skip
saw his face
() Has anybody seen him since last night
They all realize they haven't
(cont
) Jesus Christ
Rob turns, rushing into the house
- Rob stops as he notices, near the foot of the stairs where he'd parked it upon first entering the house yesterday afternoon, Skip's overnight bag
He turns and bounds up the stairs
- Rob runs down to Skip's door and flings it open
cheap rubber hobgoblin drops suddenly in front of him, suspended from the ceiling on frail, metal springs
Rob jumps back with a startled cry, then angrily tears the thing out of his way and throws it down
This is the last of Muffy's little April Fool's gags, and as with the overnight bag, it signifies that Skip has been nowhere near this room
But Rob steps inside and looks around just to make sure
The room is untouched, the bed unslept in
- Rob hurries out, as Muffy finally appears, emerging from the wooded grounds, basketful of mushrooms in hand
She approaches
(noticing their distress ) Something wrong
Rob rushes by her
Wait
'll go with you
Me too
- As Rob, Arch and Chaz come running down to the water
They stop and look around, seeing nothing
No answer
(aloud: for Skip) Hey, asshole
Wait a minute
Look at this
He has found on the little pebbled beach beside the dock, Skip's switchblade
It is in pieces
There's blood on the broken blade
This was Skip's
What do you think
That guy on the ferry
don't know
don't know what to think
say we go looking for him, him or Skip
One of them's bound to still be around
somewhere
You mean split up
Let's not take any chances
He was
He was pretty big
No sucker's taken me yet
He rips a loose board off the dock for a club
- In the gathering twilight, Muffy puts the basket of mushrooms away on a shelf
Someone grabs her wrist
She gasps
It's Nan
Nan steps from the shadows
know why you're avoiding me
() guess it's your idea of a joke
that's why you invited me
How'd you find out
From one of his preppy 'friends'
Who else have you told
Who else knows, except the father
() don't know what you're talking about
Oh
The tape just got there
You know very well
my abortion
She comes apart, in tears
Muffy stares, uncomprehending
(cont
) thought you wanted to be friends
you think you can play with people's feelings just because you're rich and can do what you want
Well, you can't
She rushes out the rear door
Muffy tries to recover, confused
She continues on to the back entrance to the kitchen
- Swinging open the door, she almost runs into Harvey
() Sorry
was just checkin' to make sure everybody was all right
He beats a hasty retreat the other way, passing Nikki on her way in Nikki raises an eyebrow at Muffy, misinterpreting the tension in the air
Harvey
No kidding'
Maybe that explains your clothes
() What d'you, mean
Oh, c'mon
Muffy exits hurriedly, upset
- The path is narrow and tortuous
Arch uses his club to clear the way, trying to follow its twists and turns
He also tries to make vocal contact
Hey, shithead
chickendick
yeah, you
Skip
He moves deeper and deeper into the forest
Up ahead on the pathway a thick, black viper slithers out of the undergrowth, stops, sensing Arch's presence, and coils itself against his approach
as Arch stalks forward, not looking at the ground
( ) Skip
Arch steps right over the snake and continues on
as Arch hears a noise
He stops
is here with him, very nearby
Skip
He turns and moves back along the trail, peering into the dense foliage on either side
as he steps over the snake again going back the other way
He stops again, looks all around him, then turns once more and starts to move very slowly with short little steps back in the other direction
Skip
He is edging closer and closer to the snake
He is bound to step on it this time
The snake coils itself to strike
Arch's foot comes down just missing it, less than six inches away, when suddenly the ground seems to move
noose springs up, tightens around his ankle, and Arch is lifted into the air upside down, swinging wildly, dropping his club
Now the viper strikes, and Arch sees it
He is shrieking with horror as he tries to bat the creature away from him
But he keeps swinging into it, and the snake keeps striking at him, trying to find an opening
Suddenly a long, gleaming blade   and chops the snake in two
Arch looks up, his face white and frozen into a mask of sheer terror, no longer able even to scream - Kit, Nikki and Harvey are waiting on the back porch when Rob emerges from the woods nearby
(calling to him) No Skip
Chaz now comes out of the woods on the other side of the yard
No luck
( ) Where's Arch
He isn't with you
don't like this
definitely don't think  like this
think it's about time we called the police
The screen door  again
They look up
It's Muffy
She returns their stares stiffly, without expression
She holds flowers cut with hand shears
Eight-two-four-eight
Constable Potter has an office at his home
( ) don't think we should wait any longer
Rob moves into the house past Muffy
Kit follows him
(to be played like Muffy) Who wants some tea
() It'll calm our nerves
She exits toward the kitchen
Nikki
perplexed by her behavior, looks strangely after her
- Nan sits alone on a stone bench beside a small Buddha statue in a secluded corner of the garden behind the house
She has been weeping
Her face tells the story
Now a gentle wind springs up rustling the leaves of the thick bushes surrounding her
She looks up
Rob is on the phone trying to reach the Constable
He hangs up the receiver, then lifts it and starts to dial again
Kit, standing beside him
now wanders silently off into the dining room
-  - As Kit enters, Muffy comes in from the pantry, breathless and apologetic, her hands full of tea boxes
didn't know what kind anybody would like so  just
got them all
Let me help
() Has he reached the Constable
Rob
No, we haven 't been able to get through to the mainland yet
Muffy eases
Kit turns the tap to fill the kettle
The pipes begin to The tap sputters and coughs out a spurt of brown water before running dry
L1UFFY Oh
the main
it's probably broken
() No water
Nikki and Harvey enter, having heard the pipes banging
What's happening
No water
What
It happens sometime
But there's still the well all the island homes have some kind of pump
or well
for emergencies
Nikki reaches for a large flashlight beam
Jesus
'll go
Just point me in the right direction
() Not without me
Harvey accompanies Nikki out the back door, leaving Kit and Muffy alone again
(bearing up under Kit's stare) 'm not worried
'm sure those two
Skip and Art
they're just up to some kind of stupid trick
Kit moves out of the kitchen uneasily
- Nikki milkes ghost sound8, following Harvey out through the dark
It makes him nervous
() don't think you should really do that
() Is that it
The well is the old-fashioned kind
(cont
) Boy, when she said `well,' she really meant 'well'
who dug this thing
Pocahontas
She reaches for the wooden bucket attached by metal nook to the thick rope
Harvey pre-empts
Here, let me do it
've probably had more experience than you
You mean, back home on the farm
know you think 'm a hick, but 'd like to change your mind about that, if you'd only give me the chance
Why
Because, 'd really like to plow your field
(" ) Draw me some water
He's glad to oblige, opening the hinged wood well cover and lowering the bucket slowly
The dark hole seems to go on forever
Suddenly, there's a muffled  deep within the well
Aw, crap
What happened
lost the bucket
Harve
Hal
The rope was rotten, any fool coulda seen that
You didn't
Here, shine your light down so  can get a fix on it
She rises on her toes, flashing the powerful beam down the dank hole
Harvey bends over to look
rotted piece of the well cover breaks off in his hand
He lurches forward
Oh
oh, Jesus
He slams back in ashen horror
(} what
Stay back
Don't look
'm a big girl now
think  can handle a few spiders and --- She shines the beam down again, bending in for a look
-- She should've listened to him
Nan's body lies twisted and jammed among the slime
Her dress is torn, revealing a white breast with veins of blood streaming across it and into the water
Next to her, Arch's severed head gapes up in a rictus grin, joined in its leer by Skip's decapitated head
It's like the very guts have been torn out of her
She screams, stumbling back
as Rob runs up, everyone else is already there
() What is it
() You don't want to know
( ) In the well
Oh, God, the well
Rob grabs the flashlight from Chaz's hands and leaps up to take a look
After a long, horrifying glimpse he has to step back to control his overwhelming nausea
He shudders violently
( ) We have to leave, all of us, we have to get away
(closing the well cover) We can't get away
Everyone back into the house
Now
( ) Let's go
- Looking in through the windows we can see Rob alone in the living room still trying the phone
to the dining room windows, we see Nikki seated at the table with Kit and Chaz on either side of her
Harvey stands behind them against the wall
- Kit is trying to comfort Nikki who is still in shock
It's okay, Nikki
With the others
they were outdoors
But we're inside now, and we're safe
() It's all because of what happened on the ferry, isn't it
( ) It was an accident
Don't they know that
Muffy enters from the kitchen with a glass of water
Harvey pulls her quietly aside
Muffy, where do you keep your guns
() Guns
We don't keep guns in this house
The others turn and look back at them
There is an uncomfortable pause
(handing Nikki the glass) Here
, Oh, God
Not the water
It's all right
It's Perrier
Suddenly the phone rings
They all look toward the living room
- as Rob snatches up the receiver
() Hello
He listens for a moment, then almost collapses with relief
(cont
) Constable Potter
Thank God it's you
The others stand and start drifting in from the dining room
- Constable Potter is calling from a pay phone near the reception desk
He listens for a moment, then
What are you talking about
() That ain't possible
() And 'm telling you, 'm here at the hospital now visiting Buck
He came out of surgery last night--It might interest you to know he'll be all right-- and Cal's been here too, the whole time
to reveal the ferryman Cal standing anxiously beside him
Rob looks like he's just been clubbed on the back of the head
( ) Constable
() Here
She's all right
() With Muffy
What do you mean
He looks up at the others who have gathered around him expectantly
() Yes, all right
Please
Please hurry
He hangs up
Pause
(anything, but jubilant) He's on his way
We're supposed to wait here
to stay together
What about the ferryman
It isn't him
They've been together all day
What
don't understand
They look at each other ominously
() don't either
() He's going to send up a flare as he's nearing the dock
Then we're to go down as a group to meet him there
( ) In the meantime
we just wait
He goes out of the living room
- Rob bolts and double-locks the front door
He also fastens the chain just for good measure
&   - Chaz and Nikki secure all the doors and windows to the outside
- Kit enters, checks and locks the windows
She turns on the lamp
On the desk -- prominently displayed and catching her eye -- a - It is a black-and-white picture, probably Muffy as a child
But what's confusing is there's another little girl next to her in the picture, who looks just like Muffy, too
doesn't understand
She glances at the walls for more pictures
Muffy enters suddenly, interrupting her
Kit startles, turning
They face each other
( ) It's my father's study
() just came in to make sure everything was secure to lock the windows
Good idea
Sometimes
with the tides
it can take someone all night to get here from the mainland
and even then, sometimes they don't make it
'  - Harvey is unlocking his suitcase which is back up on the bed
He reaches in and pulls out a small revolver
He drops the cylinder, checking to see that it's loaded, then snaps it back in place
He tucks the weapon into the waistband at the small of his back, then slips on his navy blazer
- No one is around and no one has been down here since earlier in the day when Muffy apparently brought down the painting with the vacant eye-holes from outsid~ Rob and Kit's bedroom
off the painting, now hung on a blank wall, to the transcan window which is still propped open to the outside
Chaz, Nikki, Kit and Harvey are here, trying to wait it out
(peering out the window) What's taking him so long
(quietly; without conviction) It could be the tides
Wait a minute
Aren't we supposed to be staying together
Where're Muffy and Rob
Rob's checking the back of the house
And Muffy
She's been acting less than normal anyway
(picking up on it) What do you mean
You mean all day and you haven't noticed
Well, who isn't
and those nurse's shoes
What nurse's shoes
The clodhoppers she's been wearing today
crepe soles
It's as though some common nerve of suspicion has been touched
They all stir
She was arguing with Nan in the hall, before you and Rob
before you came back alone
They turn full attention on him
About something Nan found in her room
What
() Something about an abortion
They all pause
found somethin"g in my room, too She reaches into her bag and pulls out the black rubber bondage hood
only  don't think it was intended for me
( ) Oh, really
(to Chaz; defending Nikki) And What did you find
didn't find anything
We're supposed to believe that
That's right
( ) spent the night with Nikki
() What about you
What about me
What's your little secret
() don't know What you're talking about
Oh, come on, sport
walked in on you last night , and you were acting like your ass was on fire
It wasn't anything
Just some clippings
of some car accidents
() Nothing personal in that,  suppose
No
Who hasn't been in a car accident
It's a common thing
haven't
There is a slight pause
Rob comes into the living room, holding a flashlight and stands just inside the doorway
The others shift uncomfortably
() What 'd like to know is, how did Muffy find out about these things and why --
Stop it
Just stop it all of you
() What is wrong with us
Nhat happened to all our talk about friendship, and undying loyalty
(looking from one to the other) Do you know what we're saying
That we're actually sitting here discussing the possibility that Muffy, a generous friend, has invited us all here to -- She stops suddenly, freezing in mid-sentence, and they all turn, following the direction of her look, to see Muffy standing in the entryway behind Rob
'm going upstairs
Muffy
We should all stay together
This is my house
() 'll be in my room
She turns and heads up the stairs
Pause
() She's got a point
() We're starting to get on each other's nerves
As long as we all stay within shouting distance of each other
( ) You coming
He joins her, and they quietly head for the stairs
'm goinq to find the way up to the attic
Why
'm sure we can watch for the Constable better from up there
Kit hesitates
It's all right
can keep watch on the stairs
Rob ho1ds out his hand to her
She takes it and they walk together toward the stairs
'   - Muffy enters, closes the door quietly and locks it behind her
She crosses to her bed, slowly sits down and loses herself in troubled thought about everything that is going on
Harvey steps up to the halfway landing and sits down
He looks above, looks below, then opens a magazine and begins thumbing through it
'  - Nikki's suitcase is open on the bed, and she is moving nervously about the room, gathering her things and cramming them into it
Nikki, come on
What do you mean, Nikki, come on
Don't give me any of this Nikki, come on
What are you doing
Look, stay if you like
Lock your door
Dig a trench
Hang out
But once  leave this place, 'm never coming back
She walks out the door, and Chaz follows her to
- They cross the hall
(catching up to her) We're all supposed to stay together here
Yeah, that's been real effective
She goes into
- and starts to collect all her stuff from in here
Chaz comes in behind her
So what are you going to do
Just waltz on down to the pier
By yourself
Check your bag with the porter
Then wait for an ocean liner to happen by and pick you up
Is that it
, (pushing past him) can't stay here any longer
She goes back out into the hallway
Chaz follows
- as they cross back to Nikki's bedroom
What if the Constable never even comes
Then 'll swim all the way back to the mainland
can be strong if have to
'  - as they re-enter
Look, just relax-- Three people are dead and you're telling me to relax
Nikki, now just hold on a minute, and look at me
Look at me
She stops and looks at him
(
) Now, am  nervous
Yes
Maybe even a little bit scared
Yes
Am  running around like a chicken with its head cut off
Nice image
No
() mean, come on, babe
Lighten up a little, huh
He quickly slips the & mask over his head, clowning around
(
) () Look at this
What, me worry
Very funny, Chaz
() You've got to look on the bright side of things
Everything'll be all right
Huh
Huh
Don't be a jerk
() Oh
Now 'm turning you on
Right
, Take that thing off
() Why
kind of like it in here
(moving blindly toward her) Kiss me, you savage she-devil
Get out of here
She pushes him and he falls backward across the bed
() Ooooh, stop it some more
love it when you're rough
She turns and goes out of the room again
Chaz remains lying across the bed
() Course it would help a little if  could breathe in here
For when things start to get really passionate
() Nikki
the open bedroom window for a beat
The curtains luff slightly in response to a gentle breeze wafting in
- Nikki comes down the hall with some more clothes on her arm
She arrives at her door, opens it (she had not closed it the last time she went out), and goes inside
'  - Chaz is still lying across the bed as last seen, except that now his hands cover his crotch
() Real subtle, Chaz
She continues packing, moving around the room
(
) Now 'm supposed to throw off my clothes and jump on you
Just wind her up and watch her go
You've got a lot to learn, buddy
No response
Chaz lies perfectly still
Not even his chest appears to be moving
(looking at his crotch again) What is this
Show and tell
() 'll show you mine if you show me yours
() Well, forget it
You may as well just stick it back in your pants
() Chaz
Chaz
( ) Say something, goddammit
She swats his hands away from his crotch
Beneath them, on his pants, is a slowly growing blood stain
Nikki gasps, her mouth contorting into a scream that will not come
She turns suddenly in response to
a
, and sees a stepping out from behind the slowly closing bedroom door
- It is almost pitch black
there is the sound of a lightswitch being flicked on and off
(
) No lights
Suddenly a flashlight beam pierces the darkness, and Rob and Kit can now be seen ascending the stairs to the attic
- as they arrive at the top
Rob sweeps the one large room with her flashlight
Piles of old furniture are stacked here and there, covered with grimy sheets
No one's been up here in years
Rob crosses to the garret windows overlooking the sound
Can you see him
There must not be a light on the boat
Or
he's chosen not to use it
Kit
He said something else on the phone, about Muffy
What
He said not to trust anybody
That's why we were to stay together
No one was to be left alone with anyone else
Then he said, especially not with Muffy
So that's why you let her go upstairs
That's why  let her go
() What did he mean by that
don't know
He wouldn't explain it
But that's ridiculous
Is it
He's known her longer than we have
He sweeps the flashlight back toward the stairs
Rob, wait a minute
What's that
Where
She takes the flashlight from him and aims it on something near the door--the Barbie and Ken dolls from the previous night's dinner
It's just the dolls
She's been up here
So
She moves toward them while Rob stays by the windows looking out
As she gets closer to the dolls, however, Kit realizes that they have not just been stuck there haphazardly
() Rob
Rob comes over to join her as we  : of the dolls as the flashlight moves across them, slowly revealing them one by one
The last to be seen are a Barbie and the heads of two Kens stuck in a bowl of water
KlT staring at them, frightened and astonished
Jesus
( ) Rob
It's Arch and Skip and Nan
Rob
Wait
He takes the flashlight from her and reveals two more: a Barbie and a Ken lying next to each other with no clothes on, both of them splattered with bright red nail polish
What are these other two
Suddenly the room is flooded with light
Rob turns sharply and sees outside the window the Constable's flare hanging in the night sky
He's here
there is a   from downstairs
Kit screams
Come on
He jumps to his feet, grabs hold of her hand and pulls her with him out of the attic
- as they come racing down from the attic
Rob heads for the main staircase
Hal
while Kit runs down the hall to Nikki's room and flings open the door
Nikki
She isn't there
Kit backs into the hallway
Downstairs
she can hear Rob moving about, calling for Harvey, but up here all is quiet and threatening
She hurries silently down to Chaz' room, opens the door and steps inside
'  - It is dark again in here, but the video camera is still operating
Kit closes the door behind her and leans forward, barely whispering
Chaz
Nikki
She turns on the light and sees the bed, both beds: they are drenched in blood
Kit reaches for the doorknob
It comes off in her hand
Rob
She's frantically pounding on the door and trying to jam the doorknob back in, to get it to work
There's a  outside the window
She turns aghast
Suddenly the door flies open
() can't find Hal-- He stops in mid-sentence as he sees the beds
Kit is already through the door
Rob follows her out
- Rob is running with her toward the stairs
Rob, what about Muffy
Forget her
( ) She's my friend
She breaks away from him and dashes down to Muffy's door
Rob has no choice but to follow her
() Muffy
Muffy
She tries the door, but it's locked
(pulling her away) Let's go
Rounding the corner to the shadowy back stairs, Rob suddenly bumps into something, someone there
He screams aloud, dropping his flashlight
It is Harvey
His body dangles from the rafters high above the top of the rear stairs, a thick rope around his neck
Now Rob has become unnerved, and it is Kit's turn to take the lead
This way
And they head back toward the main staircase
-- The flarelight wanes
Constable Potter looks up anxiously
Soon he will be waiting in darkness
(Unlike the previous night's scene, now there are no outdoor lights on here
) - Rob and Kit burst out of the dining room as if the house were on fire
Kit stops to pull the doors shut behind them
(yanking her away) Forget the doors
Within moments they have crossed the back yard and disappeared into the brush leading down to the water
- The night is a landscape of terror
As Rob and Kit race through the darkness, the forest seems to fold in on top of them, completely enclosing them within itself
- They arrive at the water's edge and slow down abruptly
Though they can see Potter's boat rocking gently in the water, moored to the dock, they cannot make out any sign of the Constable
(in guarded approach) Constable
Mr
Potter
No answer
The silence is chilling
They proceed out onto the dock
They come to the boat
() If there's another flare, we can signal him
Maybe he went on to the house
Rob unlashes the mooring, grabbing hold of the line to pull the boat in
It won't budge, the line snagged in the water where it dips in
Rob tugs harder, freeing something to the surface
It is Constable Potter, his body turning once before sinking again under its tethered weights
An animal cries out behind them
Rob wastes no more time, pulling the rope and the boat quickly toward them
They jump in
There is a flashlight in the toolbox
Rob grabs it, shining it onto the controls
But there's no key in the ignition, and no other way to start it
Shit
no key
Kit, meanwhile, picks up the  that's lying on the bottom of the boat
Rob
He turns
(cont
) Look
She presses it into his hands
He shines the flashlight
Its waterstained, but still legible
The letterhead reads, ' ,' and it is dated ' 31,' addressed to Potter, and reads: "
Pursuant to our previous communication, please be advised that the patient under discussion has still not been found and returned to custody, and it now believed to be attempting to return to her home in your jurisdiction
If encountered, exercise extreme caution and notify us immediately, as Miss St
John has been a patient here for three years and is still considered incorrigibly unstable and extremely dangerous
" Kit looks up, frantic
Miss
St
John
What's it talking about
Muffy hasn't been in any state mental institution for the last three years -- she's been at Vassar
don't know
but we've gotta get this boat started
How
The house
Didn't Muffy say there was another key back in the kitchen
( ) Oh, no
We've got no choice
know
Shit
Rob
Huh
Rob,  really don't want to go back there
know
Shit
Another pause
Neither one is making the move to go
'd have you stay here, but-- No
() Listen, Kit, we'll get out of here,  promise you
We've been through so much together
She has started to cry softly
(cont
) it isn't going to end here
( ) Okay
He kisses her
Pause
Well
Yeah
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Brief pause, then he turns to go
Shit
They move slowly off the dock
- Rob and Kit move up to the shrubbery skirting the back lawn and gaze across at the house
It is completely dark within and remains wrapped in silence as before
Rob, look
The doors
They've been closed
Sure enough, the doors they come out by minutes ago, the ones they didn't stop to close, are now shut tight
Come on
They move stealthily through the bushes around to the side of the house
They stop
There
He is pointing toward the open basement window across a thirty foot space of clear lawn
That's how we're going in
Kit swallows hard
She nods
Are you with me
They break from their cover and run, keeping low, to the side of the house
Rob peers through the window into the darkness inside , pushes the transom all the way open, and then drags himself through on his belly
- He drops to the floor, turning to give Kit a hand
She enters the same, dusting herself off next to him
Rob turns on the flashlight, using it cautiously
(moving through darkness) The stairs
Where are the stairs
What's that
They pause, hearing in the darkness , comi ng from the depths of the utility room
Rob leads the way, cautiously, toward the sound
The flashlight cuts through the dark, revealing the tap  in the tub
Before, the tub was clean
, however, stubborn crimson  smear the basin, like blood that has refused to be washed away
Other stains darken the floor
Kit's eyes widen in growing horrow
Rob turns the beam toward the stains that track across the floor, following them
() Rob
The trail leads out of the utility room to the large, cast-iron incinerator
Rob steps forward, slowly opening its door, angling the beam inside
- Inside, Muffy's characteristic attire -- the clothes we saw her wearing yesterday after their arrival -- lie stuffed inside, bloodied and charred
Muffy's clothes
() don't get it
The beam momentarily sweeps the wall next to Kit
She sees something
(an urgent whisper) Rob
She gets him to turn the beam back to the wall where she is
She helps train it on what she saw
- It is a growth chart that has been marked in ink faded over the years
There are growth measurements for ''
and for a child named '"
with similar heights on similar dates
She gasps, finally connecting it
Oh, god
oh no
He doesn't yet understand
the picture of the girls in the study
the letter
what the Constable was trying to tell you
It's not Muffy it's her twin sister, Buffy
She has a twin sister
Rob's eyes have a glazed look
They are fixed somewhere else
Rob, don't you see
() Rob
She follows his look and sees, on the wall near the growth chart, that he has trained his flashlight beam on the eyeless portrait from the night before
Only now, there are     , () Rob
He casts about for a weapon, coming up with a length of lead pipe
Pull it away
(too frightened to move) Rob
Pull it away
They advance together on the painting, Rob keeping his flashlight on the eyes the entire time
Kit slowly reaces out, lifts the painting from the wall and drops it, jumping back
just as '  rolls forward from a shelf behind the painting, right into Kit's lap
Kit screams as she bobbles the head in her hands like a hot potato, trying to get rid of it
Suddenly a loud  slams at the basement window
Rob grabs Kit, covering her mouth and snapping off
the flashlight
The head falls to the
floor at their feet
They turn
just in time to see the window they entered being nailed shut from the outside
All else they can make out are Buffy's hands and her tell-tale nurse shoes
Then these two move of sight around the outside of the house
Rob clicks on the beam in the direction they went and sees the stairs
They race to them, up them, the door to the pantry is not locked
It gives way under Rob's pressure
Kit scrambles up behind him
They can hear Buffy outside in the yard the kitchen door
- Rob and Kit hurry in
Rob searches frantically for the key board
The boat key
it's gotta be here
His flashlight sweeps the walls of shelves
Suddenly, Buffy is at the kitchen door
Though the door in locked, there's no bolt or chain to fully secure it
The knob  furiously under Buffy's grip, the door
Rob spots a walk-in cupboard
He hurries to it
Kit gropes along the shelves, searching the objects hanging along the distant wall
long, ugly-looking knife blade slips in through the crack in the door
Buffy is using it to try to pry open the door
Rob opens the door
Success
His beam falls on the key board on the inner wall
Kit He steps in, following his beam into the darkness
The cupboard door shut behind him
He turns, trapped
- The door springs open
Kit spins, crying out as she sees: The shadowed figure of , barefooted, disheveled, in a smock, dagger in hand
She advances, breathing heavily
stumbles back desperately
No
Rob is desperately trying to break out, but the door won't open
Kit
Let me out
Let me out of here
Kit
He is kicking the door, hurling himself at the door, but all to no effect
He barely has room to maneuver
(
) Rob
Kit turns to Rob's voice, takes a step toward the cupboard, but suddenly Buffy is there, cutting her off
Kit backes away, into the dining room
( ) Kit
Run, Kit, run
Kit reels back under Buffy's steady advance
Kit can't see her clearly in the dim light, but she can make out, beneath Buffy's wild, stringy, dangling hair, the madness, the likeness of Muffy -- the familiar face somehow twisted by hate and madness into a stiff, hideous, unnatural deformation
Buffy closes in, readying the long, greedy knife
Rob, still struggling, knows Kit is about to die
Kit
love you
Cornered, helpless, Kit stumbles back toward the closed double doors that lead to the living room
Buffy
please, we didn't mean any harm
we're leaving
we just want to go home
please
please
Buffy raises the dagger in hand
No longer trying to escape
It's hopeless
(for all he's worth) Kit
love you
love you, Kit
man's  reaches out from the side, lightly touching Rob's shoulder
Rob jumps, turning
It is Buck, standing practically right beside him, staring at Rob
His face is the same bloody, hideous mess it was the day before, after the accident
Rob screams
love you too, babe
Rob swings at him, but only succeeds in smashing his knuckles against the door
Buck grabs him and violently plants a kiss on his cheek
Kit slams back against the double doors, nowhere to go
No
Oh, God
and Buffy strikes
The knife jabs into the door, close to Kit's head
Kit gasps, momentarily spared
She pushes apart the double doors and stumbles back into
All the lights are on, and when Kit takes her eyes off Buffy long enough to find out why, she discovers everyone is here -- Skip, Chaz, Nikki, Arch, Harvey, Nan, even the Constable and the ferryman
They sit or casually stand, quietly talking or reading magazines, taking no notice of her whatsoever
Rob is screaming uncontrollably
Buck calmly peels all the blood and gore right off his face and slaps in onto Rob
Rob keeps screaming
Then Buck reaches out and unlatches the door
It was right there the whole time
Kit is totally bewildered
( ) What
Then she looks back at Buffy who steps into the living room, and smiling, holds up the knife and plunges it into her own hand
The blade is retractable
(wrought with emotion) Oh, fuck you
Fuck you, you guys
Suddenly everyone in the room comes to life, roaring with laughter
Rob stumbles out of the cupboard, Buck's gory make-up still stuck to his face
Kit
Still frightened and confused, Rob hasn't put it together yet
He runs out of the kitchen
through the dining room and into the living room where he stops dead cold upon seeing everybody
Ki--
The group laughs louder at the sight of him
Buck walks up behind Rob and claps him on the shoulder
Rob jumps and screams involuntarily
The group laughs louder still
-- Muffy is wiping off the last of her "Buffy" make-up
You guys are really terrific
love you all
And  thank you from the bottom of my heart for being such good sports
( ) Oh, sure
Quite welcome
Any time
He sits, or rather lands, on the sofa next to Kit
Laughter
Rob, you and Kit, you two were the best
You figured it all out
The clues really worked
What clues
What's this all about
And don't anyone say "April Fool's" or 'll smack them in the teeth
How about if  told you it was the script for a weekend special that's going to help me keep this house
Rob and Kit stare, mystified
() Look, next month  get the house as part of my inheritance, it's true, but only if  can show my father that it can carry itself
what with taxes and expenses
Otherwise, he'll just sell it out of the family
So, 'm planning on turning it into a country inn
Not just another stuffy old run-of-the-mill country inn, but one that specializes in offering once-in-a lifetime Whodunit Weekends
needed a rehearsal had to try out the idea on somebody
( ) And you guys played along
Don't look at me
We all got sucked in just as bad as you
Once they were killed off, yes
Everybody had to cooperate
Otherwise, none of it would have worked
So  guess there's no crazy twin sister Buffy
Oh, there's a crazy twin all right, but his name isn't Buffy
His name
Muffy smiles, directing attention toward "cousin" Skip
Skip
He's your brother
You bastard, you were in on the whole deal, too
() Only the set-up
Muffy told me to say  was her cousin and to pull that prank on the ferry
had no idea what was going to happen with Buck
() Buck Williams
make-up artist par excellence, from Hollywood
Buck reaches down and tosses Arch's decapitated head to him
Here, catch
Arch bobbles the head nervously
The others laugh
Just some old props  redressed with the help of photographs Muffy sent me
It sure fooled me
( ) So what castle are you going to inherit
() Well, first he's got to prove he can manage his own allowance
(to the Constable) Which means,  guess, that you're no constable either
Kit Graham, meet my Uncle Frank St
John of St
John et Freres, Wall Street
Uncle Frank smiles and waves at Kit, but Harvey steps right over to him and starts pumping his hand
Hi
Harvey "Hal" Edison, Jr
Pleased to meet you, sir
Usually we don't even see Uncle Frank in the summer, he's so busy
But this time he made an exception
haven't had this much fun since my Hasty pudding Show sophomore year at Harvard
God, lowe you kids
() How'd  do
never did no acting before
Boy, was  shaking
Cal's our regular ferryman between the mainland and the islands around here
but  thought he was up to the dramatic challenge
(: ) Well, that's it
Now you know it all
We have been had
You're lucky you didn't get yourself killed
() almost did with Harvey
And who could know there would be a snake out in the woods with Arch
But with the paying guests, they'll know what they're in for: and the scenario won't be nearly so extreme
Otherwise, even Lloyd's of London won't cover you
And  regret that, well, some of those fake clues  planted in the bedrooms  guess were taken too seriously
'm sorry about that
She avoids looking at Nan so as not to draw attention to her
(cont
) But we had fun, didn't we
mean, come on
She starts passing
out chilled champagne bottles to the men to open, and setting up glasses on a sideboard
(cont
) know 'll never forget this weekend for as long as  live
You're telling me
Man, when  was swinging around out there in the woods,  nearly crapped my pants
What do you mean, nearly
was there, remember
Silence
Arch turns red
() Arch
You browned your trousers
(; ) Well
(-) It's all right, Arch
They'll be out of the dryer soon
Suddenly everyone roars with laughter
Champagne corks start popping, and before you know it, the scene is resembling the locker room of the winning team of a championship series
- Breakfast
Spirits are high
Friendships rekindled, and the spread is incredible
Muffy enters with a fresh basket of piping hot biscuits
Only Nikki, Harvey, and Cal are not present
Great ham
Great eggs
() Just what we need
Another country inn
Well, if the food's any indication, it's already half-way there
Pass the toxic wastes, please
Uncle Frank frowns at Skip as Cal enters
() The St
John Island Bar Harbor ferry leaves in thirty minutes
No stragglers, please
- Rob and Kit are the first ones in, busing their dishes
Boy, what a difference being alive makes
(; ) don't care what Columbia says about you
do
() Is this the road to med school
think it is
'm going to try
He takes her by the hand and gazes at her
But if  make it or not, no matter what happens, we'll be together
You and me
() If that's what you want
( ) That's what  want
Muffy enters with a stack of dishes, followed by Nan who quietly sets her plate on the counter and leaves
Where's Nikki
don't know
Too much champagne
o
s
they hear a muffled cry
'  - as Harvey finishes plowing her field
They lie still for a moment
( ) God
don't tell me that was something you learned on the farm
- Uncle Frank is hugging Muffy
(nothing seedy)
They are alone out here
'll make a full and glowing report to your father tomorrow so he can draw up the deed along with the other trust papers for Wednesday's signing
'm so proud of you
() wish  could say the same about your brother
Oh, Uncle Frank, he's been a great help this weekend, really
Let me get him out here so you can-- 've already spoken with him
The screen door opens, and Rob steps out onto the porch
He comes over to them, but does not butt into their conversation, and Uncle Frank just keeps going as if Rob weren't even there
(cont
) His conduct and his academic performance remain inexcusable
He knows your father can't be expected to entrust him with anything until he shows some signs of responsibility and initiative
(embarrassed to be overhearing) Excuse me
He turns and walks back into the house
a horn honking
- The van and the old pickup are idling out front
Uncle Frank is honking on the van horn
Come on
Let's go
Cal is alone behind the wheel of the pickup
Skip walks casually up to the van, then pointedly turns away and heads over to the pickup instead
Uncle Frank scowls
- Rob and Kit come out the door and stop beside Muffy
More honking
Well,  hate to say it --  still ought to kill you -- but thanks
( ) See you back there
Come on
If time is money, we're losing a fortune
Nikki now runs out followed closely by Harvey
They say their quick farewells and move along to the waiting vehicles
Harvey discreetly opts to ride in the pickup, while Nikki climbs aboard the van, passing Chaz who just glares at her
He knows
Finally Nan comes out of the house
With a curt nod to Muffy, she heads on toward the van when
Nan
She hurries to catch up with her
Let me say again how sorry  am
It wasn't intended
And now all is forgiven
played along, didn't
What's done is done
() 've learned a lot, Muffy,  really have
suppose  should say thank you, but  don't think  would be able to without it sounding false
So 'll just say goodbye
(beat; an afterthought) Thanks for showing me your house
She turns and crosses to the van and climbs aboard
The others callout their last goodbyes
Muffy waves, and then they are gone and Muffy turns and walks forlornly back into her house
- Cal and Uncle Frank are the first ones onto the ferry
Cal,  want to thank you personally
You've been a real sport about this
Aw, it was fun
know you've had your eye on that p1ace ever since we were kids
And 'm sure we could make a deal with you
know you haven't been spending your money on anything else all these years
But
this time it just isn't in the cards
It's still in the family
Yes, that's the way
He moves on
Others are passing them now
Chaz stops and wags his finger at Cal
This time, no funny business
- Muffy stand, overlooking the mess
Not knowing exactly where to begin, she starts emptying ashtrays into each other, then just stops
She walks out of the living room and through the entry hall and slowly climbs the stairs
From far away the ferry can be seen chugging away, slowly returning to the mainland
- closer now we can see what's happening on board
Rob and Skip lean against the rail and talk quietly
Kit and Arch and Buck sit together and chat
Chaz sits alone, and Nikki sits apart from him, also alone
Nan is up front, gazing out over the bow, while Harvey stands beside her trying to make conversation
Finally, he gives up and strolls to the back of the craft, pointedly passing Nikki
He alights next to Uncle Frank, who has his briefcase open on his lap
Now Nikki stands and goes and sits down next to Chaz
() Feeling better
() 'm okay now, thanks
Pause
Chaz, 'm sorry
Why
What do we mean to each other anyway
More than this a couple of days ago
( ) couple of days ago
couple of days ago  was a great, young, budding filmmaker who was going to turn pornography into high art
Today 'm just a stupid college kid with a toy camera and about as much idea as where he's going as
as
He gives up
() Don't be down
Sure
Pause
'll tell you what 've learned from all this
'm tired of having one fling after another
don't want any more of that
want a boyfriend
() Chaz
Will you be my boyfriend
He looks at her, slowly softening
Yes, he will
Rob turns away from Skip now, steps over and surveys the quiet group
Some party, huh
() You know what  think's weird
how, when we thought 'Buck here got hurt because of Skip's prank, and when things started happening and we thought maybe some of us were getting killed, how we all just kind of naturally accepted the fact that it was 'oh , yeah, sure, because of the prank
' () What're you talking about
Well, it's like pranks really piss people off
It unleashes things, you know
Makes any kind of behavior possible, and we accept it
When anything g
oes, everything goes
Yeah
What really amazes me is how easy we made it for her
Everyone was just out for himself
We could've stopped Muffy cold if we'd only stuck together, if we'd only worked like a team
Yeah, she really got us good
Well,  know what 'd do, if  wasn't her brother
(almost without thinking) Go back and give her a taste of her own medicine, that's what we should do
Nikki steps
Leeks up, hearing herself
Skip returns the stare
(shrugs, smiling) Did  say anything
The others look at each other, a beat, registering
Hey
Go back and scare the shit outta her for a change
Outrageous
She sure wouldn't be expecting it
( ) Well,  don't know
got a stack o' books this high
(stepping into the fray) Harvey's right
(to them all) Look, what're you talking about
We've had our fun
Now we got work to do
Yeah
Enough's enough
At least for me anyway
Pussies
Well,  kinda like the idea -- and  don't have work to get back to
She squares her shoulders
(looks up, in surprise) Kit
( Muffy can dish it out
It might be interesting to see if she can take it
All right
real catfight
(open-mouthed at her) don't believe you
() Just because you've decided to get serious about your life, doesn't mean the rest of us can't have our fun (whoops, turning) Buck, got any spare professional tricks you could throw our way
Buck looks up, confused, only now plugging in
So how many does that make us
( ) Much as 'd like to
() No,  don't think so, thank you
Nikki continues count
Rob makes it easy for her
() Four
He meets Kit's stare squarely, giving her time to change her mind
But Kit smiles back, victorious
(one of the four) Outasight
Cal, we want to get back to the island
Now
You just left know
[) Well, not in this
( ) but you might find something around after we dock
-  - The big ferry drifts into the slip, and the passengers begin to disembark
'  -  - The phone on the bedstand
Muffy answers it on the second ring
() 'lo
: - Skip is talking on a pay phone
() Hi, it's me
Surprise
(grumpily, stirring) What'd you forget now
Nothing
Just calling to tell you the party's not over
She moans
know
The clean-up's going to take Clara and me at least a week
No,  mean, some of the gang's planning on coming back to give you some of your own medicine
Coming awake
You're kidding
Does a bear shit in the woods
Those bastards
Hey, they're your friends
Which ones
That wouldn't be very sporting if  told you, would it
() Skip
Rob and Kit and Nikki and Chaz
Figures
Thanks
Well, Uncle Frank told me about his recommendations
So,  didn't want you to think there were any hard feelings
() Oh, Skip, you dope
You know Daddy'll come around just as soon as you decide to buckle down
Yeah
() Anyway, don't let the bastards eat you up
'll try not to act too surprised when they arrive
love you, Sis
You too, goofball
Skip hangs up
(
) Asshole
beg your pardon
to include Arch, who has been standing beside Skip the entire time
It was even your idea
petty consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds
Bullshit
St
John blood is thicker than water, that's what you mean
( ) Don't you know
Old money sticks together
Arch goes to his car and drives away
At some distance, Harvey is chasing down Uncle Frank as the latter closes in on his Mercedes sedan
Well, can  look you up in a couple of months
Maybe you could arrange a job interview for me
Sure, sure
(reaches into his pocket) Here's my card
( ) Thank you, sir
Thanks a lot
sure appreciate it, and it's been a real pleasure meeting you
But Uncle Frank is already in the car and starting it up
Harvey looks down at the card
-  ' It reads simply: Franklin St
John, St
John et Freres
Hey, wait a minute
There's no phone number here
No address
No nothing
Too late
Uncle Frank is driving away
He speeds past Skip who is walking down the road further along
He doesn't even stop for his own nephew
Harvey kicks the dirt angrily
behind him a horn toots
Harvey turns and scowls at Nan, who would like to get past
He steps aside, and she peels away but she stops for Skip
They exchange a few words
Then he climbs into the front seat beside her, and she drives off
Now Harvey is alone
He looks around for a beat, then tosses the card away and moves toward his car
- Rob and Chaz are trudging along
What the fuck was he talking about anyway
We might find something around after we dock
They walk out onto a private peer and eye the boats moored there
What the fuck do you think he was talking about
Oh
(
) Hey
What are you two doing down there
Rob and Chaz look o
s
in response to the voice
-   - Still trudging
Well, now we've been identified
Swell
It's getting late
What a great idea this was
They round a bend and stop dead
In the distance, Kit and Nikki are climbing into a boat
Nikki sees them and waves
(} We got one
Rob and Chaz
thought we looked there an hour ago
Who cares
Let's get this show on the road
He starts running to the boat
Rob reluctantly follows
(calling back to them) Did you find a key
How're we going to get the motor started
- The house stands quiet, the dying rays of sunlight reflected off the large bay windows overlooking the sound
- as, huddled together in a rowboat, Chaz, Nikki, Rob and Kit arduously make their way back to the island
- Looking at the front door
Someone is visible through the translucent glass pane coming up to the door
knocking sound
- as o
s
the knocking continues
No sign of Muffy
Muffy finally emerges from the study, crosses to the door and opens it
Nikki walks in
() Muffy, hi
Surprise
Nikki, what on earth are you doing here
Is something wrong
No, no, nothing's wrong
Chaz and  just figured there was nothing we had to get back to that couldn't wait and you could probably use a hand with the clean-up
It's our way of saying thank you
Oh, great
Where is Chaz
Nikki is already moving into the living room
Putting the boat up in the old boathouse
He'll be up in a minute
Nobody around and no sign of a boat
- still and waiting - Muffy and Nikki are seated across from each other
wonder what's keeping Chaz
He should have been up here by now
Maybe he stopped to shit in the woods
You know Chaz
Still
'm beginning to not like this
By the way, where did you get the boat to come back here
The boat
Oh, Cal gave us one
see
Listen,  need a drink of water
() You just stay here
can get it myself
She walks out of the living room
Muffy looks after her and smiles to herself
- as Nikki enters
She doesn't turn on any lights, but simply crosses to one of the kitchen windows and opens it
She gazes out into the night for a moment, then backs out of the kitchen
- pulling the swinging door closed behind her
She turns, takes two steps toward the living room and stops; remembering her water
She goes back to the kitchen door, but suddenly it will not open for her
Frustrated, she heads back through the dining room, but stops dead halfway across and turns slowly and looks back at the kitchen door
She goes out of the dining room
- and walks up to the other door into the kitchen
It too it's closed and will not yield
- as Nikki returns
What about your water
Oh', uh,  drank 'it in there
() Listen
Muffy , 'm really getting worried about Chaz
think we should go out and see what's happened
That's okay
You go
'll wait here
No, really
don't want to go alone
'm still scared from last night
Please come with me
'm sure Chaz is fine
'll stay here by the phone just in case
It's safer this way
() Do you want a flashlight
() No, that's okay
'll be fine
She strides out of the living room
- as Nikki comes out the front door and heads off into the woods
() Shit
- Muffy sits quietly a moment, thinking
Then she gets up and goes toward the kitchen
- She comes to the kitchen door, pushes it open
no sweat
and enters
- Muffy doesn't turn any lights on either
She goes to the sink, sees that there is no used water glass, then' she notices the open window
She smiles
She does get herself a bottle of Perrier out of the fridge, opens it, pours it and walks back out of the kitchen, leaving the window untouched
- Nikki stumbles through the darkness
Suddenly she disappears from view with a loud
Fuck
She comes up sputtering to the surface of a small forest pool she has fallen into
Fuck
Who dug the goddamn swimming pool
She drags herself out
(o
s
) Nikki
( ) Yeah
She walks, dripping wet, into a clearing nearby where Kit it making Chaz up to look bloody and gruesome
We have to go to plan
She wouldn't come out
Doesn't she care about me
No one answers him
(cont
) How do  look
lot goddamn, fucking better than  do
- No one is here as' Rob pops his head up outside and slips in through the open window
He stops in the middle of the kitchen and listens
Then he goes into
- He creeps down the hall, then turns and starts to tiptoe up the back stairs
further down the hall to
- just as Nikki bursts in through the door
, Muffy
Muffy
Come quick
It's Chaz
- ( ) he's hurt
Oh, Godl
She stops suddenly
Muffy isn't here
Frustrated, Nikki runs back into
- She looks around
Muffy
She dashes into
- Muff--
and stops short
Muffy is lying face down in a pool of blood
Her throat's been cut
The useless phone receiver is clutched in her hand (making that constant phone company noise that lets you know the phone is off the hook)
( ) Muffy
Her throat gags a couple of times, as if she is about to be sick
She turns and flies out of the room
the front door slams shut behind her
- (
,) () Chaz
Chaz
She runs into another clearing (the  has been here waiting for her) where Chaz is revealed lying on the ground, looking much more hideous than Muffy
Chaz, get up
Hurry, Chaz
come on
He doesn't move
Chaz, stop playing around
Get up
She starts kicking him in the side
Chaz
Chaz doesn't stir, but he does speak now without moving his lips
(hissing, pretending to be dead) Will you quit kicking me
It hurts
It's supposed to hurt
The game's over
Get up
(still not moving) No
'm dead
You're blowing the whole thing
Where's Muffy
() Muffy  dead
In the house
() Oh, God
(sitting up suddenly) What
(turning to the woods) Kit
Kit, come out
There is rustling
, then Kit starts to emerge
What's going on
- Muffy is still lying face down as we saw her last
She hears footsteps going upstairs
- Rob is creeping up the attic stairs when he hears footsteps o
s
too
He pauses, his face draining of color
- as Chaz, Nikki and Kit come racing up to the door and run inside
- as they come charging in
She's gone
Nothing left, but the pool of blood and a thin trail of smeared drying blood to indicate that she's been dragged away
What
Look, she's been dragged away
() Chaz
somebody's still in this house
We could follow the trail
() Oh, no
what about Rob
( ) Rob
She races out of the study
- The three of them come clambering up the stairs, Kit in the lead
They turn a corner
Then they see him
dead on the floor
Rob
They run over to him
(dropping to her knees) Rob
Rob
(shaking him: wailing) Rob
(dissolving into tears) It was only a game
( ) What the fuck is going on here
() Chaz, look
Clutched in Rob's lifeless hand is a leather bookmark we may have noticed before
Chaz slips it out from beneath his fingers
() This was Nan's
() Nan
Suddenly there is a loud  beneath them
They all look up
Someone is coming slowly up the stairs, the loud footsteps
that could only be made by a heavy boot, thundering closer
and closer
Kit and Nikki and Chaz huddle around Rob's body and await their approaching doom
Suddenly a dark figure fills the doorframe at the top of the stairs hand with a knife is raised
Nikki screams
Chaz spies a lamp on the floor
He turns it on
Muffy
Muffy walks into the room , lowering the knife
Good job, you guys
'm really scared
( ) The fun's over, Rob
(tears in her eyes) Muffy, he's dead
Somebody else is here
In this house
Sure
Sure
( ) Let's see if the dead are ticklish, shall we
(pulling her away; screaming) Don't you touch him
Okay, okay, take it easy
Muffy, it's not a game anymore
Just then there is a loud  o
s
of glass breaking down on the first floor
After the slightest pause there is another crash o
s
, and another
Someone is smashing in all the bay windows along the back porch
Nikki screams
() What the--
And she runs back down the attic stairs, followed quickly by the others
- as Muffy bursts out of the stairway and into the hall
Then Kit
Suddenly the door to the stairwell slams shut on Nikki and Chaz cutting them off
key turns in the lock
Muffy and Kit turn back to see a male figure in the darkness who'd been hiding behind the door
Kit is nearest to him, and without warning, he lunges at her and buries a knife into her stomach up to the handle
Kit screams and chokes, trying to fight him off: but he stabs her again, and again and again, plunging the knife deep into her with every thrust
Muffy
Stop him
Help
He's killing me
Oh, God
He's killing me
Muffy, initially paralyzed with fear, now runs for her life, down the hallway, down the stairs
- and to the front door as Kit's screams
fade to silence
Muffy yanks on the door handle, but the door will not open
She pulls again and again desperately, but it won't budge, She turns and runs out of the entry hall
Just as she  , the front door swings silently open
- Muffy is racing past the back stairs toward the kitchen when reaches out from the pantry and hooks her around the face
She is pulled backward, screaming, through the swinging door into the darkened pantry
It is Skip
He pulls her head back, exposing her throat
He raises a knife to it, still stained with Kit's blood
() It's all over, Muffy
Everything'll be mine
Skip
No
He makes a move to slit her throat, when Muffy kicks open the swinging door and sees
standing on the other side, smiling, in various states of fake blood and mess
Rob, Kit, Nikki, Chaz and Nan
Muffy's eyes pop out
Skip's hands relax
And the others burst out laughing
being lifted into the air
It reads: Just Another Country Inn Proprietors: St
John et Frere to see Muffy supervising the raising of the sign in front of the house, while Skip drives up in the van, bringing the first customers to the door
