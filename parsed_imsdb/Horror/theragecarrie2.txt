He moves toward a shattered window, through which some  escape
But  turns her head slightly and
travels across the row of at the bar, exploding them one-by-one, spraying alcohol which douses
erupts from the fireplace
Striking the alcohol-drenched , setting a blazing trail and lighting the curtains on fire, creating a wall of before the windows
Stop it
You don't want to-- And  snaps her head around, launching another  from the fireplace which strikes  in the back, whose alcohol drenched clothes catch flames
and she ,

screaming  pitches forward, rolls on the floor to put out the flames, but caly succeeds in lighting another trail of liquor which creates a barrier to the backyard windows
In the eye of the storm is , shaking her head in denial, muttering, as her mental state rapidly deteriorates
No, this isn't happening
It isn't happening, isn't happening

Utter , but  calmly turns into the hallway, following , as if in a trance
lowers his shoulder, crashes through a closing door into
where the walls are decorated with deer heads and hunting trophies
and  are smashing a standing glass case containing pistols and rifles
leans panting against the wall
slips a  into his belt
Screw that, get the shotguns
Shaking, freaked out, they gather weapons

They take off in the other direction, bringing up the re Barrelling shoulders first into a door, the boys burst through and into

Toting their rifles, ,  and  turn to find , at a gunfighter's distance, coming towards them
and  cock their weapons and bring them to their shoulders

Wait till she's closer
tightens her finger on the trigger
's eyes narrow and
's glasses shatter into her eyes, spewing blood milky fluid
Aaaaa
She staggers, fires her shotgun into 's groin and he lands sitting next to the pool
dying  stares at his shredded lap, then falls over
looks at his dead friend
Oh, shit

But his rifle goes sailing over his head and into the grass twenty feet behind him
He makes eye-contact with a grim  advancing toward him, and hauls ass
glances at a coiled   and it springs to life, slithering through the grass and across the concrete at high speed to wrap around 's ankle and trip him up
He hits the ground hard and rolls over to find the hose twisting around his legs and up his waist like a python
grasps for the rifle, but falls short as the hose pins his other arm to his side, then curls around his windpipe in a stranglehold
104
His eyes widen as the life is squeezed from him and he sees standing over him
He gropes for the shotgun again
and finally grabs it
looks at the rifle and it flies from his hold, splashing into the pool
But she jolts on two
looks down
had pulled the handgun from his belt with his pinned hand and fired
She's holding her belly, gutshot, staggers and falls into the pool, disappearing amid a swirl of blood
yanks the hose from his neck as it goes slack
He gasps, points the gun into the pool and  until it's silent and he's left pulling the trigger on empty chambers
He gets his breatking under control, leans over to look into the water of the deep end
He Aar on the sound of a mechanical whirring, and turns
starts to unfold
At that moment

grabs her forearm as her other arm yanks him into the pool
-- As  drags  down, he kicks and pummels her, but she holds on
The   steadily closes over them, shutting out the light from above
finally frees himself and lunges for the surface, but the   blocks his escape
He desperately pushes at it, eyes bulging, lungs burning, as his feet kick to keep him afloat
-- The   closing as , hauls herself from the water, barely making it out

His fingers slip under as the cover completely shuts

Then

He sees the gunshot wounds in her stomach, then follows her gaze to

And all the  fade from her face and body Love
Her face is serene

pulls  over the debris ridden floor toward the back windows, but stumbles and goes down
Her eyes flutter open
Leave
Get out Instead of leaving her,  hugs  closer
The sleeve of his jacket catches flames
And he accepts his fate

An all-night study session
