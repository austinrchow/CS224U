Written by David Leslie Johnson February 5, 2007 : --   ( 30S ) She's a simple beauty and very pregnant, propped up in a bed, wearing a hospital gown
heart rate monitor
She touches her swollen belly, flush with excitement, her eyes full of wonder
'  (
) Okayp, just relax
now
This'll be over Caitti before you know it
Kate looks up
Her smile falters-as we : - Harsh lights overhead
- rumbles outside
Kate's on a
delivery table, legs already in the stirrups
sheet hangs- across her belly so we can't see what's going on below her waist
and  snap pn gloves, prepare instruments: and ,  and
Kate is stricken
She tries to sit up
Wait, 've changed my mind
don't want to do this anymore
The Doctor gives the Nurse an exasperated look
The Nurse takes Rate's hand, eases her back onto the table
Your baby is dead
There's nothing
else we can do
Kate reels, her world turned upside-dowp
Emotional free-fall
No, this isn't what's supposed to happen
My baby's alive
We're so sorry
terrible loss, we're so sorry
But it's still alive
It's moving
Feel it, you can feel it
Kate tries to put the Nurse's hand on her
belly but the-Nurse- pulls away and hands the Doctor a pair of gleaming
blunt-tipped The Doctor leans between Rate's spread legs, disappearing behind the curtain
Rate gasps
No, stop

-- late for anesthesia
'' The baby's coming
You're
going to experience some pressure now
- Kate winces and bites her lip as the Doctor goes about his unseen work
-  in surgical scrubs stands behind him
Bizarrely, he's videotaping-the whole thing
He's Kate's husband, (late 30's)
He smiles at her from behind -the camera
It's okay, honeys You're doing great
The Doctor hands the scissors, now slick with gore, to the Nurse

The Nurse - presses a button on a vacuum pump and the machine begins to
Kate tightly closes her eyes
This isn't happening
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Suddenly -- the thin wail of a
Rate's eyes go wide w ith horror as the smiling Nurse approaches with a wriggling bundle wrapped in a blanket
Blood seeps through the pink fabric
e can't see what's inside, but it's moving
And it's
Congratulations, Mrs
Coleman
It's a girl
The Nurse offers her the bloody, blanketed bundle
Kate screams - '  - -- then snaps awake
She's been having a nightmare
John lies n ext to her in bed
Be stirs, but doesn't wake
Kate slips out of bed and quickly pads to the bathroom; '  - Kate closes the door
We now see that she's not pregnant in reality, only in her nightmare
She slides to the cold floor in t he dark, a hand on her flat belly as she starts to cry
'  - Water  in a little Zen fountain
Kate sits across from -
-, a mousy-haired woman in her 50's
lot of women experience difficulties around the anniversary of the miscarriage or the baby's expected due date
It's perfectly normal

really thought 1 was doing better
You are
Think about where you were just four months ago
- (off Kate's look) Are you still sober
Kate hesitates
Dr
Browning gives her a penetrating look
drove by the wine shop,on my
way
bome the other day
Did you stop
really wanted to
The thought went through m' head, you know
it wasn't for me, it just might be nice to have a bottle handy in case we had guests
But you didn't go in
No
That's all that matters
Let's try to stay focused on the
positive
Grief is different for everyone
You have to take it at your own pace
Keep writing in your journal
You're doing fine
Rate smiles weakly
unconvinced
- Rate hangs curtains over a beautiful picture window
She steps' back to admire her work, then sighs
Now what
Now that she s done, the house suddenly seems-quiet and lonely and too big
- Kate sits in a rocking chair, gazing out a distinctive '
We realize that she's -In a fully furnished and decorated nursery
Crib, changing table, baby swing
No baby

Max shows her an art project she's bringing home
Wow, did you make this

'  - Kate's' driving
She stops at an intersection crosses the street in front of them and stops at the corner
Kate watches her for a long beat as if transfixed
In the backseat, Max- her hands to get Kate's attention
Kate turns and sees Max pointing to the traffic light

Kate snaps -out of it and drives off
- Kate sits at a baby grand piano,'trying to compose a piece of
music
She plays a few , frowns, tries again, takes a pencil and erases what she's written down
She pauses to look over-at a beautiful  in an ornate plants= by the window
For a moment, she just stares at it
Then: 13 1 She's startled by something outside  off the side of the house
She closes her eyes, frustrated

- Max is playing basketball in the driveway, but the ball's too big for her and the hoop's too
high
Every time she tries to shoot, the ball falls short and  against the house

Kate opens-the door, angrily signing as she speaks: Stop banging that against the house
'm trying-to work
Max gives an abashed look
Kate sighs
She knows she was too harsh with her
-No, 'm sorry
But just
take a break for a little while, okay
Max nods
Kate goes
back inside
pulls into the-drive
It's John and eleven--year-old-, Rate and John's other child
Daniel's blonde, brash, and-cocky, the all-American kid
He's wearing
a Little League uniform
Daniel runs toward Max
He steals her ball and dribbles-it around her in circles
-Max watches glumly
He offers her the ball, but when she reaches for it, he snatches it away and shoots a lay--up
- Boo -yahl He shoots
He scores
Nice one, champ
- Daniel pumps his arm and runs inside
John walks up the drive, carrying a bouquet of
He hands Max the ball and lifts her up to the basket
Max happily puts the ball-through'the hoop
All right

She smiles and gives him a high-five as he carries her inside

-  - Kate has just sat back down at the piano when she hears Daniel tear into the house and run upstairs
She slumps her shoulders and closes her notebook
No more work today
John enters
Drapes look'nice
Curtains
(off his
look) They're curtains, not drapes
And haw exciting is my life that - now know the difference

He offers her the flowers
That's this for
Just love you
He kisses her as she takes them
Some of her gloomy mood melts
'  -- Kate tucks Max into bed
Ore story
Then bedtime
Okay
Max nods
happily and picks up a book from her nightstand
Kate groans inwardly when she sees what it is
It'
s called
"We were Going To Have  Baby,
But We Had An Angel Instead
" You want to hear about the baby again
Max nods
Kate hesitates, then gives Max a sad smile
'  -  () Kate sits on Max's bed, reading and showing her the pictures: "People send us flowers and cards, but we still miss our baby
If this just happened to you, 'm sorry you got an angel instead of a'baby
think a baby would have been more fun
" The last picture is a      watching over them
Yes, she is
She's with us every day
Kate gives Max a gentle kiss on the forehead

She swallows the pill-with a Dixie cup of water

'  - John watches  in bed
Kate enters from the bathroom in a nightshirt and sits on the bed
She
rubs lotion on her feet
John watches her, then reaches out, runs his fingers uup and down her back
Kate freezes
He can't see the-nervous look that crosses her face
He moves closer, pushes her hair aside, kissing hex-
neck
Kate responds stiffly, trying to get
in the mood
He slides a hand around her waist, moves it up to her breast
'm sorry
can't
Shit
She moves away, tears suddenly in
her eyes
He gives a concerned look, lets her have her space

'm so sick of feeling like this
Christ, the kids must thing 'm crazy
Will you stop worrying about what everybody else thinks
How can
saw a pregnant woman today on the way home and  almost lost it
Just burst into tears with Max sitting right there
Daniel barely talks to me
You and  haven't had sex in over a year now
What if
never get better
don't want to lose you
You're never going to lose us promise you
just wish
(off her look) Have you thought any more about adopting
can't even be a mother to the children we already have
That's not true
The kids understand
They just know you're not happy
But  should be
- Do you want another child
You Snow  do
More than anything
Even if it can-'t be'biologically ours
- Then what are we talking about this -for
Let's do it
You-don't just adopt a child because you're lonely and depressed
That's not why we'd be doing
it
We wanted a child a year ago and we still want one, now
We can't replace our baby
No, 'we can't
But we can take the' place we made for her in our hearts and our home and give it to a child who needs a family
() Kate, we love being parents
We're good at it and'it makes
us happy
What better reason-do you want
Kate looks at him for a beat, then smiles and lets her tears fall

The Lawyer turns to Kate
Kate hesitates

(') With your background, you could have a newborn in as little as a year
We've'alread y waited a
long time
:We'd lake a child as:quickly as possible
Well, 'getting an older child-As definitely quicker, not to mention cheaper, but- there's a reason for that
lbt of these kids- have serious behavioral problems

Trust me, we're ready for anything
You must have a lot of love to give
Are you looking for a boy or a girl

We'd like a little girl

} '  - John is driving
Kate is studying pages and pages of photocopied records in a manila folder
-John gives her an amused look
You're not worried about being prepared
- There's not gonna be a pop quiz
Kate smiles
She closes the folder and looks at a Polaroid of a happy, seven-year-old Puerto Rican girl stapled to the cover
The name next to the photo is

From-2L ,   looking out a second floor window, we see Kate and John get out of the'car
Someone in watching them
Kate senses movement and looks up
but there's no one there

-  - Yolanda; the girl from the Polaroid, is playing with a dollhouse
The door-opens
Kate and John are led inside by  , an African-American nun in her 50's
Yolanda, look who's here to see you
Yolanda, smiles at Kate and John
She runs over to greet them, but stands just out of their reach
-Kate kneels in front of her
Don't you look pretty
6ister Abigail put ribbons in my hair
See
Wow, that was nice of her
Look, we brought you something for the trip tomorrow
She hands her a bag of activity books and a "Travel Turtle," a kid- sized lap desk for coloring in the car_ Yolanda's face lights up
What do you
say
Thank you
Kate reaches out to her, but Yolanda pulls-away, focusing all her attention on her presents
Rate gives her a sad 'smile
-  --  () Yolanda is drawing a picture, "Travel Turtle" on her lap
Kate and Abigail sit nearby, watching
Kate seems worried
Abigail notices
She speaks in a low voice so Yolanda won't hear: Nervous
Yeah
And happy
And excited
: And proud
And scared shitless
It' s funny
All the same feelings  had when  was pregnant with our others
That's what really worries you, isn't it
Something bad happened, the last time you felt this way
(off Kate's look) () ') Yolanda's doing something similar
She's afraid of :getting hurt again,
too
Bit  have a-good feeling'about you two
You can help
each other heal
And you're lucky
You have a wonderful husband who can be there for you both

-  - 'John emerges frcaitthe '
The walls of the hallway are lined -with Children's-artwork
He glances at it as he walks by
Suddenly, he stops short
Amidst the crude watercolors and _macaroni mosaics are several beautiful ain s, s'% surprisingly sophisticated, more Like the works of Henri ' usseahan the o crayon-and-stick-figure scribbles surrounding them
Then he hears something: a  ' , softly =  a tune
We know the words
When  was juuust a lii

HOM13   -   - John follows the  to a stark, white room
Light slants in from a big-window, shining on    in a lacy white dress
Her
back is to us, so
we can't see her face, just curls of platinum blonde hair spilling to her shoulders
She sits at an easel, all alone, painting another extraordinary picture
John watches, curious
Suddenly; she senses his presence
She- stops humming, the paintbrush freezes mid-stroke
She turns
She looks about eight years old, with pale skin and-bright, doe- like eyes, her delicate features framed by Shirley Temple curls
It's the face- of a porcelain angel, a perfect little laving doll, friendly and inviting
She wears a thick black velvet ribbon around her neck and one around each wrist
Her'name is
Hi there
Hello
- She speaks with a strange accent
Sounds Eastern European
Are these , paintings all yours
Yes
Do you like them
Very much
They're remarkable
- 12
h  ank :you
My name is Esther
What's yours
John
It's nice to meet you
She smiles and demurely offers her hand, giggling as he takes it
She blushes, then turns back to her painting
It's a half- finished jungle scene with a   crouched beneath a tree
So what's this one going to bo
My paintings are stories that come from my imagination
-This one'-s about a'sad mother lion who can't find her cube
She's smiling
She's dreaming about her babies
It's the only thing that makes her happy
Well,  hope she finds them
She will
,bok
As she speaks, Esther dabs her brush and paints little lion cubs curled up in front of their sleeping mother: They were lost'in the jungle 'and they were so scared because they didn't'have a mother or father
But just when they thought they'd be alone forever, they found their mother sleeping under this tree
And they felt so safe that they fell asleep too
Now when-the mother lion wakes up, her dream will have come true
She has her family again
Where did you learn how to do this
've just had lots of time to practice, guess
It's so boring here
You don't play outside with the other girls
Sounds like they're having fun
13
like staying inside
That way don't get my clothes dirty
(amused) - Well, that's very responsible of you, but 'll- bet the sisters could find something else for you
to wear
You
don't like my dress
- Don't you think it's pretty
- Your dress is
very pretty
'm ,just saying
you could -probably go outside if you really wanted to
- (a beat, hesitant) don't like laying with the other girls
'm different from everyone
There's nothing wrong with different
Yes, there is
Everybody says there's not, but it isn't true
don't care
If 'm sad or lonely,  just come in here a nd paint a story with a happy endingg And when people say they like
my paintings, it makes me feel better
(off his look) think
peo le should always try to take the bad things that happen to them and turn them into something good
Don't you
John is taken aback
Who j t1m1s )dc
Before he can respond: -  (
) There you are
Rate and Sister Abigail stand in the doorway
John waves for Kate to enter and Esther sits up eagerly when she does
Abigail's expression darkens when she sees who John has been talking to
Hey, 'd like you to meet someone
- (to Esther)
Esther, this is my wife, Kate
Kate smiles and offers her hand, but instead of shaking it, Esther lovingly presses it to her cheek
14
- - Motta
Kate'and John exchange a beumsed look'
She painted these all by herself
' Wow, you're quite the little-artist
' Thank you
You smell nice
Kate laughs
Sister Abigail shifts uncomfortably
Would you like me to paint you a picture
You can watch me if-you want
'm normally a little shy, but -- ' Esther, 'm sorry, they don't have time for you to paint them a picture
(off Esther's look) They have to come with me now
Yolanda's going home with them tomorrow
isn't that wonderful
Esther wilts
She releases Rate's hand and musters a weak smile
Yes
'm sure she'll be very happy
It was nice meeting you
- The pleasure was mine
(to Sister Abigail) You've got a real talent on your hands here
Yes, we're very lucky to have her
But there's something -strange-in Abigail's voice -- she definitely doesn't un -lucky
Esther watches them go
-  - Sister Abigail walks Kate and John to the front door
I5
The notary will be here at
ten for-you- to sign the placement agreement
Thank you so much for all your help
Kate gives her a warm hug
But mid-embrace, she notices something: Esther is at the end of the hallway, peering at them from around a corner
Abigail and John see--her,' too
What did she say to me
back there
It sounded like
"motta
" It's Russian
It means "mother
" JoHN'  - John whistles "Whatever Will Be, Will Be" to himself as he drives
Kate gives him an amused look, then Jokingly sings along: - When you were juuust a liuittle Sorry, 've got that stuck in my head now
She
made quite an impression on
you
wish you co'uld've heard the things
she was saying before you c&me in Jatow adults who aren't that mature
() wonder' why they didn't show us her case file
She probably wasn't there when we were first ,looking
It just blows may mind, a kid could go through as much-as she must have and still turn out like that
You sound like you're sorry we're not adopting her instead of Yolanda
16
No, of course not
just hope she
gets the right break
(off her look) wouldn't trade our littl'e' girl for the world
You )maw that
Rate gives him an adoring look and squeezes his hand
-  -
The sun is just rising,
warming the sky with an idyllic light
-
- The  (5-7) are busily getting dressed and making their beds
The  inspects each of-them in turn
One bed remains unmade, its occupant missing
The Housemother turns to the room, ready to give a scolding, but can't find who she's looking for: Where's Yolanda
-  - The   (8-12) are-brushing their teeth and washing up
The Housemother enters and looks around
Have any of you seen-Yolanda
Nobody has
--  - Sister Abigail leads the  and   in a search of the home, looking for Yolanda
The playroom, art room, chapel, classrooms, laundry room, rest rooms
-- they're all empty
-  - young-nun,  , walks downstairs into -a dark storage- area
Lots of hiding places
- Yolanda
Are you hiding-down here
Then she notices a closet behind her
The door
is ajar
She reaches out, opens it
and nearly gags at what she sees inside
- child's bare feet dangle in mi , , a
,im3
The "Travel Turtle" is on the floor beneath them
-  chair lies on its side nearby
17
--  - Kate dries her' hair in the bathroom
The
She pauses, suddenly concerned for some reason
She opens the door
As John reaches for-the phone,    on Kate
She watches from the doorway, her  face already registering dread
She knows
Even before he answers the phone, somehow she knows
(0,-) Bello
- The sky has turned gray
Kate stares out at the hotel parking- lot, smoking a cigarette
- Her eyes are red;- but she's long since cried-herself out
John stands by the open-sliding glass door
The birth family is claiming her body
They're planning a private service
He looks to Kate for a reaction, but she has none
He continues: Sister Abigail thinks she might have been playing something called "The Choking Game
" It's a kind of schoolyard dare
You try to get a rush by having someone choke you until you almost pass out
There have been cases where kids have tried it alone and accidentally hanged themselves
beat
Kate's voice is distant, as; So that's it
She just vanishes from our lives
We can have our awn-service
think it's important that we - 've been' in grief counseling for almost a year-and-a-half
If you say the word "closure,
" 'm going to-claw your eyes out
She's not angry, just matter-of-fact
Be wants to say something, but holds his tongue
Silence hangs heavy between them
Maybe we're not supposed
to do this
18
-
No
Don't say that
- - - we -try to
have a baby and  have a 'third-trimester miscarriage that leaves
me sterile
'We try to adopt and she dies the night before we bring her home
That doesn't sound like' somebody's trying to tell us
something
- Yolanda didn' t the to
teach us a lesson
We didn't make this-happen
' It doesn't make
anndifference can't go through this again
so let's not
Let's adopt
Bather
This brings Kate back to reality
She eyes him coolly
Her body's barely cold and you're already thinking about replacing her
We can't replace Yolanda any more than We can replace Jessie
But we can't help her anymore, either
Esther is alive and needs a family
Right now
We have to at least wait until
-- -Until what
don't want to waste a nother year of our lives wishing for something that we
can't-have
(beat)
want us to feel like a family again
Kate regards him for a beat, conflicted
Then: Let's see what Sister Abigail thinks
-  '  -  - Sister Abigail hands Rate and John a folder with a Polaroid of Esther stapled to it
Her- case file
19
For the most -part, she's an'ideal child
She's originally from Russia, but her English is flawless, Smart as a
tvhip and very mature Afor her age don't think 've-ever had to tell her anything-twice and 've never had to clean-up after her
She's a bit of a- nQat-freak
think we can handle that
She's also fiercely independent
, Whatever the other-children want to do, she wants to
dc the opposite
She told me they make fun of her
'm sure they do, but she doesn't make- things any easier on herself
She just doesn't seem interested in friends
She doesn't even play like a normal child
She just reads and paints
Most of the time she barely-speaks
Why do'you think that is
Well, like most of the girls here, there's been no shortage of hardship in her life
- She's been orphaned twice-- her birthmother died of , then the American family who adopted her was- killed in
a house fire
And  strongly suspect that she's been sexually abused as well
By who
don't know
There's nothing in her -history, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything
Russian adoption - records
are notoriously unreliable
Then what are you basing this on
Sister Abigail hesitates
Deciding how much to say
20
wish  knew
There's just something missing with her
-spark you see in a child's eyes that isn't there
've only seen that-before in cases where the child had been severely traumatized
It might also explain - some of her idiosyncratic behaviors
Like what
She refuses to shower or change clothes with the other girls
' She won't even allow the housemother in-the bathroom with her
She
'
s also very concerned with her physical appearance for her age
She's like a teenager getting ready for a date every morning
She insists on wearing dresses-every day
The ribbons around her wrists and neck stay on day and night
The only trouble we ever had with her was when we tried to take them off
She kicked two of Sister Francis' teeth-out
Kate and Tohn are taken
aback
Abigail sighs
'm sorry
'm 'not trying to discourage you
If you're serious, 'll do everything  can to-expedite the process, given the circumstances
() My one reservation is
this
When-an adoption fails, it's usually because the parents didn't know what to expect
-And'in this case,  can't' tell you what to expect because the plain fact of the- matter is that- don't knaw
:    - Esther is happily-helping a  clean the sanctuary
Kate and John sit in a pew near the back of the empty chapel
She really did open up with us, didn't she
She latched
right onto you
We're probably the best chance she has at a
normal life
Esther looks up from her work and waves at them
They wave back
21
normal life
' That sounds really good,',doesn't it
- She smiles
and takes John-
's hand
-
Esther's feet, saddle shoes  on -the walk
Kate walks beside her, holding her hand
In Esther's free hand, she clutches a -  held together with a rubber band
Activity on the playground stops as the girls watch Esther leave
None of them look sorry to see her go
She ignores them
John puts
Esther's things ---- a small suitcase and her-paintings in the trunk of the car
Sister-Abigail sees them off
- If you ever need anything, please don't hesitate to call
Before Kate
can respond, Esther tugs on her arm
_ESTHER Come on
Let's-go) Kate laughingly lets Esther drag her away
(to Abigail) We wills Sister Abigail happily watches them go
Rate and Esther smile and wave goodbye
' She'waves back
but once the car pulls out, her smile fades
She seems'vaguely troubled as they drive away

'  - Headed for home
Kate is showing Esther some
Esther makes the sign for each letter as she says it aloud: --- Put your thumb here
She makes the sign for '

Perfect l 22
Esther smiles and practices=it a few times
- Outside, the have turned color
Esther gazes out in-wonder
- It's so beautiful, motta
Sweetie, here we say "Mont" or
"mommy
" Kate and John exchange-a warm look
- John's car turns at a  and drives down the road leading-to their private community
The secluded road winds through the forest and crosses the little  we saw earlier
' - The Coleman's neighborhood 3
s surrounded by forest,-an upscale community of big houses and manicured lawns
delivers the mail
pushes a  in a stroller
tend someone's flowers
Esther -soaks it all in
- They pull into the driveway and get out
Esther's mouth practically hangs open at the sight of their beautiful house
The front door opens and Max runs out to meet them
Daniel appears in the doorway-with   (arid-60's), their grandmother
Daniel stands aghast at the sight of the strange, pale girl with the Goldilocks curls and frilly white dress
() -Holy shit:
Max
runs straight into Kate's arms and gets a big hug
Oh, we missed you so muchll Kate gives Max a kiss, then turns to Esther: Max hangs back, a little shy
Esther signs' to Max without speaking: - ,
Max gives Kate an excited smile
She's been practicing the whole way
23
Kate takes the girls' hands and they all walk up'to the house
Esther notices Man's hearing aid
- - What's that
That's a hearing aid
It helps her hear
a little so she can read lips
John gives Doris a Use on the cheek
Hi, Mont
Thanks for watching them
(to Esther) Esther, this is Grandma Doris
pleasure to meet you
Esther surprises everyone by giving her a perfect ltttle rtse Daniel fails to suppress a laugh
Kate silences him with a look
How precious
It's a pleasure-to meet you, too
(to Esther) And this is our son, Daniel
Esther smiles and puts out her hand
Daniel grudgingly takes it
Hello, Daniel
Hey
-  - Esther walks from room to room, in awe of her luxurious new home
Kate and the rest of the family follow her
Everything's so bigi As Esther moves on to the next room, Daniel hangs back and whispers to John, too loud: Why is she dressed like that
Don't be rude
24
Esther overhears them, but pretends she didn't
Kate sees this- and tries to distract her
- Would you like to see-your room
Esther smiles and nods eagerly
But on the way up the stairs, she eyes Daniel furtively, sizing him up
'  - Kate pushes the door open and Esther enters
We recognize the room by the arched windows -- this used to be the-nursery
- It's been completely made over as a little girl's room, complete with a lacy white canopy bed covered with a mountain of

Then he and Kate turn out the light and close the door
Esther watches them go

They close their door, leaving the hallway empty and dark
Then: back down the hall toward

Then we hear the lock  shut

Esther pins up some of her paintings
Kate spreads out a selection of wallpaper borders
Okay, which one do you like
These are for a'younger child
Did you pick them out for Yolanda
Kate is taken aback
She stammers for a beat
'm sorry
'll take them back and pick some just for you
It's all right
rather like this one
Esther points out her
favorite and goes back to pinning up her paintings
Kate sighs
As she rolls up the samples, she notices the same Gothic mansion in several of Esther's older paintings
'1s that a real place
No
just made it up
It's a haunted castle where a beautiful- princess was locked away
She waited so long and was so sad that she filled the moat with her tears, but then a handsome prince swam ,across it and rescued her

Don't you

- Sliding doors open
Rate and the girls enter
Esther looks around, dazzled by three stories of glass-ceilinged extravagance
It's totally alien to her

of children's clothes
Kate pulls a pair'of jeans with
flowers embroidered on the pockets
These are cute
-Jeans are ugly
But sweetie, you have to have something you can play outside in

- Kate leads the girls through the mall, carrying  of purchases
Something catches Esther's eye

You like fish

Esther kneels in front of his cage for a closer look
Kate stands behind her
Max beams proudly
Max

It's her big girl responsibility
Aaaww,-can  pet him

Sure
But you have to promise not to- let him out of his
cage
unless- Hcumey or Daddy is,here to hold him
Why
- Because he's very delicate and you could hurt him
Okay
Esther xiods

Too fast
So what are your plans now
Well, we'll get Esther settled, then 'll probably go back, to work
Oh, so you think

, This is perfect
Thank you

John distractedly glances over his shoulder at him and Daniel does a huge cannonball into the pool
Suddenly, Esther squeals with glee
She's unwrapped an and
By the time Daniel-'s smiling face pops out of the water, he's disappointed to find that Esther has drawn John's attention again, barraging him with-hugs and kisses

Daniel fumes

Max shakes her head, confused
Then-how did it get in your room

Kate watches them, a little hurt
- Rate sits with Esther, watching her open a gift-wrapped box
Inside is a  like the one we've seen Kate writing in

She smiles, but it looks forced
'  - Kate and Esther sit on the floor
Esther
removes the rubber band from around her Bible and takes out a few battered photographs
They're all of Esther with a rural family -- the man
Kate saw in the photo at church, his ,
and  , aged 6, 10, and 14
In one, they're all posed together in front of a farmhouse
These are the Wallaces
That's James and Hannah
And that's Micah, Luke, and Isaiah

Esther nods'
They're candid -family snapshots full -of
laughter and hugs

The last one is of him and
Esther, the same photo Kate

It's okay, sweetie

(beat; considers) You know,  lost someone who was very special to me once, too
Esther wipes her eyes and looks up, interest piqued
Really
- Kate shows Esther the orchid in its ornate planter
We don't have any pictures of Jessica because she died while she was still in my tunny
But we spread her ashes in here and as long as
this flower grows, part of her will be alive inside it

about the people we've lost
And it
's okay to iniss them, too
Esther nods
They'smile at one another through their tears

She looks around
-Spots it

Esther's Bible lies on the floor at Someone's feet

and picks it up
It's Brenda
Is this a Bibl
Give it back to me
She reaches for it, but Brenda laughs and raises-it over her head
Jesus-freak brought a Bible to school
Esther angrily swipes at it again, but one of Brenda's friends grabs it first
Esther takes a deep breath, trying to calm down
I3STUER May  pleas
have my Bible
The girl hesitates, shrugs and offers Sather the Bible
but snatches it away again at the last second
Brenda laughs
8sther reaches for it, but the girls keep passing it between them
Esther and Brenda grab it at the same time
There's a brief tug- of-war, then the rubber band  and the Bible flies apart, pages and hp otos scattering everywhere
Esther gasps in horror and dives to the floor, desperately scooping up the loose pages
"crowd gathers, watching and snickering, Daniel and Trevor among them
Esther looks to Daniel for help, but he just stands there, watching uncomfortably
Brenda laughs at Esther crawling around on all fours
Look at the cute little doggied Is this your collar, little doggie

1W-
'  - The drive home from school
is silent and tense
Esther stares out the window
'Kate eyes her in the rearview mirror, concerned
- The minivan is'parked in the drive and the kids are climbing out
As Daniel and Max head to the house, Kate takes Esther-aside
Mrs
Grosse told me what happened today
Do you want to talk
about it
Daniel-hangs back to see if Esther is going, to tell on him
She "sees him standing there, then turns to Rate with a smile
- There's nothing to talk about
We were -just playing a game, that's all
She walks away, passing Daniel without, a look
Kate is
dubious
'  - Max enters, throws down her "Hello Kitty" bookbag ---- and stops short
Hodgenodte's-cag
is empty
Max stands frozen for a beat, then starts looking for him
Esther appears in the doorway
What's the matter
Max turns and tries to block the cage, but Esther sees that it's empty
Esther gasps
Where is he
Were you playing with him
Max frantically shakes her head
Esther quickly shuts the door
You left his cage open
Look
Sure enough, the door of the cage is wide open
Max shakes her head, frightened tears in her eyes
'
Then how did he get out
' XNOW41  ' ] 38
You have to think
Mommy's not going to believe your
She didn't
believe you about the necklace and she's not going to believe you about this
Max is devastated
She's sobbing now
Esther tries to calm her
It' a okay
Don't cry
Look 'at me
She takes Max by the shoulders
Max looks up, breath hitching
'll tell Monmy-it was-my fault
You won't get in any trouble
'll tell her  took him out of the cage without your permission and he ran away, okay
Max gives a grateful nod
Esther smiles and strokes Max's hair
- Don't worry
It'll be our little secret
:Max nods again and gives her a-hug
She doesn't see the calculating look in Esther's eyes
- -glassed-in terrace off of Kate and John's bedroom filled with plants
Kate is wearing only a long -shirt, watering the plants before bed
John enters in his pajama bottoms, snuggles into her from behind
Kate smiles and
leans into him
'  - The lights - are off
Kate and John are in bed, making lave
Slow, passionate, intense
When they're finished,- breathless and trembling, she cradles his face in her hands gazing lovingly up at
him
Then something catches her eye in the moonlight: Ethel Jg

Oh, my God
They hurriedly pull the sheets up and Kate turns on the bedside lamp
Esther stares at them blankly
Esther, honey
What is it
Are you okay
Esther just glowers at'her, then turns and walks away

''  - Esther
Sits at her easel, painting
Kate enters and sits down on' the bed
Esther doesn't look:at her
She's painting a sophisticated, stylized
-Other  of the family -arealready pinned to the wall
Kate shifts uncomfortably
We need to talk -about last night
Do we
Yes
There are certain things that
grown-ups do
that kids aren't supposed to see
And that was one of them
Esther keeps painting
She still hasn't looked at her
- Esther,  need you to listen to me
Esther pauses
She deliberately sets her paintbrush down and turns to Kate
An awkward beat
See, when two grown-ups love each other very, very much, they like to
show that love to each other -- Iknow
- They fuck
Kate is dumbfounded
Esther regards her with a bored, aloof-look
'  - John is troubled by what Kate has told him
- She could nave picked it up anywhere
Bell, she probably heard it at school
This wasn't something she overheard
She knew what it meant
And the way she said'it
don't even think she expected to get in trouble over it
We'll talk to her about it tonight
You think that's enough
40
' What do you suggest
' could take her to Doctor Browning
It was one dirty word
don't think we need to call in the shrink just-yet
Maybe
It just reminded The of what Sister Abigail said
We really don't know that much about her
'- The last 'family she-was with could have been - like, "Pass the fucking potatoes" at the dinner table for all we know
' Iget it,  just- don ''t want to make a bigger deal out of it than it is
If she's saying "fuck" to my face, what's she doing when we're not around
We have to be thinking about what kind of influence she's having-on Daniel and Max
Particularly Max
wouldn't worry about it
You're right, we don't know how she was raised, but we do know she's a good kid
if Danny and Max want to start acting
like her, that's fine with me
- Esther and Max pick wildflowers along the edge of the forest
Let's pick flowers for Daddy
Max
nods happily
'Then Esther notices something that makes her stop short
girl approaching on a bicycle
It's Brenda
She pretends to not see Bather, just rides right by
Esther watches, her face strangely slack
then starts to follow her
Max gives Esther a confused look, but tags along
-- Esther finds Brenda's bike parked at a neighborhood playground ---- swings carousel, jun7le gym, and a-tall corkscrew slide made-tor look like a rocket ship
There are  playing
watching
41
with a shopping cart full of stuffed garbage bags asleep by a tree
doing pilates
Esther ignores them all
Brenda is climbing on the jungle gym with some other kids
Esther walks over with Max in tow and just watches Brenda play
Brenda sees her and makes a face
Esther just stands there
Staring
What are you looking at
No response
Max tug on Esther's arm, but she's rooted in place, staring blankly at Brenda
Finally, Brenda can't take it
She climbs off the jungle gym and walks away
Esther watches 'her go
Brenda gets on a swing, but just as she starts to get some height, Ester' right there,
star n ,_p a her again
Max happily grabs a swing for herself, but Esther is fixated on Brenda
Stop staring at
mel Stop ital
But Esther is unwavering
Can't take her eyes off of her
Brenda gets off the swing and runs away
Esther calmly walks after her
Go-away
Stop following me, freak
Max sees Esther following Brenda and grudgingly gets off the swing, hurrying to -catch up
Brenda gives them an angry look
" Why don't you two,go home and change each other's diapers
Esther and Max follow Brenda across the park,, Max still uncertain about what's going on
Brenda heads for
the tall corkscrew slide
Steep stairs lead to the enclosed top, the tip of the rocket ship
Brenda starts up the stairs, then pauses
She turns to Esther
You go first
Esther doesn't move, but Max gladly takes her turn
After a beat, Esther follows Max up the stairs
Brenda stays behind, watching
Max goes down the spiraling slide, but Esther just stands at the top, looking down at Brenda
Gol
Esther, continues to stare down at her for a beat, then turns and -disappears from eight
only
then does Brenda climb up
Max runs to the stairs for- another turn
Brenda reaches the top and looks around
She sees Max
' But where's Esther
She turns
42
Suddenly, Es er is right in , of her
She didn't' go down the slide, she was just crouched out of sight
Brenda gasps -- -- then Este spits Jn her face acrd ush hex dawn the airs
Brenda  as she falls,-limbs flailing, out-of-control
She lands hard in the dirt and just lies there crying, clutching her arm and bleeding from a gash in her forehead
Brenda's scream draws alarmed looks
The Homeless Guy startles awake
one of the playground mothers comes running to help
But Max stands frozen, gaping at Esther in total shock
Esther stares blankly down
at Brenda from atop the slide
Utterly emotionless
-  () '  arrives on the scene
Brenda says something
to -him and points at Esther and Max, who watch from a distance
Are you going to tell on me
Max shrugs
didn't mean to hurt her
just wanted her-to stop picking on me
(off Max's look) Don't you hate it when someone is mean to you for no reason
Wouldn't you do almost anything to make them stop
best
Max nods
Esther offers her hand and Max takes it
- Esther and Max sit at the table
Kate and John eye them sternly
Brenda says you pushed her
That's not true
We were just playing and she tripped

(to Max) Did you see what happened
Esther eyes Max expectantly
Max hesitates
Then: Kate sighs, not entirely convinced

Kate carefully tends the memorial orchid, spraying it with a fine mist of water

She looks under one of the plant tables to'see what's attracted them: It's Hodgepodge
He's been dead for several days, his body swarming with ants and

Kate, John, Esther, and Max stand around it

John starts shoveling dirt into the bole
Esther and Max exchange a knowing look
'  - Esther and Max are giggling and playing dress-up
Clothes are strewn everywhere
They're both trying to look grown-up
They're even wearing makeup -- heavy mascara and pink, painted cheeks
Daniel walks by and sees Max putting on lipstick
He takes it away from her
Hey, you're not allowed to wear makeup
Does mom know you have this
Give it-back
, Make me
Give it back'or 'll tell Daddy, that you hit her and then you'll be in trouble
Max smiles
Daniel-scowls at Esther, then gives Max the lipstick
He leaves
Max gives Esther a hug
Best friends forever

- Kate waits in line -at the check-out
Esther and-Max are with her
Aw
Kate pushes her cart up to the-counter, she looks over and sees the nearby'" & " aisle
No big
deal, just a passing glance, a flash of idle distraction
Her eyes unreadable
Then: (
) What kind of sex do men crave most
Kate-looks back, shocked
Esther has picked up a "" from the newsstand and is'reading the cover aloud-to Max
Put that away
Don't look at those
Kate puts the magazine back
There are several others just like it at kids-eye level
"Orgasms
" "Thrill  - Of Him " Kate'sighs and-'starts putting groceries on the conveyer

Esther has picked up the same magazine
Kate angrily snatches it and pulls Esther toward her
Max startles
Stand where  can see yowl The  and a couple  turn to look at her
Kate ignores them
Esther can't suppress a little smile
- The family is eating dinner
Esther makes a face and pushes her plate away half-finished
May  be excused
At least eat your chicken
'm not going to eat something that don't like just to make you feel better
That's ridiculous
Esther, stop it
Eat the chicken and then you can be excused
Yes, sir
Esther starts eating

Well

It's been nowhere near as bad as we expected
What kinds of things is she doing

Purposefully disobeying

That was the biggie

Sister Abigail is suddenly apprehensive, tries to cover
Really

She broke her arm and had to have something like eleven stitches, think

sound very lucky
She's lucky she didn't break her neck
Sister Abigail seems troubled by this

'm Daddy's little girl, aren't
That's right
You both are
As they head home, they see  ' (late 30's) jogging toward them
blonde with dark roots and an overdone boob job
, wearing a skimpy sports bra and mini shorts
She waves to tem
- Look at these three cutiesl How're-you doing
Hanging in there
Hey,,

a chair  want moved upstairs
You think you could come over and give me a hand
John glances toward home
Kate's at the door, waving goodbye to the College Student
- She sees John talking to Joyce and gives them an unreadable look before going back inside
Uh, yeah
Maybe Kate and  -could help you -out
Okay, 'll call you
John and Max start off again, but'Esther doesn't move
She's openly looking Joyce over from head to toe
You have a l ovely body
Come on, Esther
Let's go
Esther reluctantly follows
Joyce eyes her dubiously

-- John acid the girls enter
Kate has juice boxes for the girls
look passes between John and Rate
Esther notices
How was the
iide
Did you have fun
Max nods'and heads off; but Esther hangs back, eavesdropping: Didn't waste -arty time-turning that divorce settlement-into a tit job, did= she
didn't notice
Yeah, right
She's teasing, but there's something biting underneath it
Esther walks away, sipping on her juice box
-  '   - After hours
Sister Abigail is at her desk
She opens a file and reads
We see a Polaroid of Esther stapled to the cover
- Midway rides and boardwalk games have been set up in the parking lot of Daniel and Esther's school
banner reads "" " The place is packed with excited children in Halloween costumes
The school is at the'top of a steep hill
Kate and John walk up it with the kids
Daniel's dressed as a ninja, Max is a " " fish, and Esther's an angel, complete with a shiny halo
John gives Daniel some money to hang out with Austin and Trevor
On the , playing games, winning prizes
Esther shoots BBs at balloons with a toy rifle
She's pretty good at it
On the , Esther and Max are whirled around on the Scrambler, screaming and laughing
Kate and John watch and take pictures

The girls ran up to John and Kate
We want to go in by ourselves) 49
- Okay, just make sure you hold her hand

- The girls
run inside
John smiles, but Kate watches anxiously
'  -  - Esther leads Max through the dark', winding fun house corridors
Max starts to look cared
She nearly leaps
out of her skin when a --  jumps out at them
But Esther just laughs at it
Max sees that she's not afraid and soon they're both giggling at the   that try to scare them
- The girls emerge frtn- the'maze, clutching each other and laughing
Let's play "hide and seek
" You go first
Max excitedly runs off
Esther watches her vanish into the
Moments later,-Kate and John appear
Rate-nervously looks around
Where's Max
don't know
was trying to hold her hand, but she pushed me and ran away
Oh,
my God
It's okay
Did  see where she went
This way,  think
She points the wrong way
Kate takes her hand and they quickly move through the crowd, looking for Max
John stands on a bench for a better vantage, Kate grabs passersby: Have you seen a little girl in-a fish costume
She has short brown hair
Nobody's seen her
Kate grows frantic
Esther watches with a nonchalant smile, enjoying the drama
- She tugs on Kate's arm
i Mommy,  want scene cotton candy
- 'i12 'ti 50
Not now, Esther Ia " Kate, please
Take it easy
She's gotta be around here Then Kate spots Daniel approaching, holding Max's hand
' Kate breathes a sigh of
relief and rushes to give Max a fierce hug
Are you all right
- Don't you ever run off like that[ What were you thinking
They were playing "hide and seek
"- - saw Esther let her run off
Esther gives him a sharp look
John turns on her,
angry
Did you lie to us
What did  tell you about'holding her hand
'm sorry, sir
She looks like she's going, to cry
John sighs, then turns to Kate and Max
Esther gives Daniel a hateful look through her tears
- The kids pile into the minivan for school
As Daniel climbs in, Esther' drops something behind him and pretends to find it
What's this
She shows Kate a little
Daniel blanches when he sees it
His
treehouse staah
'  - Kate and John confront Daniel
wasn't taking it to school[ Then what was it doing 'in-your backpack
- don't knowl" She just put it there to
get me in troubles 51
Where would'Esther have gotten pot
(a beat reluctant) She saw me wCth it in the treehouse
- Is that what
you're doing- out
there with Austin and Trevor
Smoking pot
Daniel stammers
John stews-
- John screws a hasp to the treehouse-door with -a   and slaps a  on it
Daniel stands below,-watching
John climbs down, shows Daniel the padlock key, and pockets it
- Off limits until further notice
Be heads to the house; Esther is playing in the backyard
She takes John's hand and walks inside with him
Daniel watches them

'  - Kate pulls out of the driveway with Esther in the back seat
As they leave the neighborhood, Joyce Patterson Jogs by in her skimpy workout clothes
She-waves
Kate gives a polite nod
Why does she have to'dress like that
- She just likes the 'attention
Well,  think it's immodest
don't know why Daddy -likes her so much
(a beat, apprehensive)- What do you mean
He's always smiling at her and talking to her
She wants him to come over to her house
Did you know that
(off Kate's look)) Please don't tell Aaddy  told don't want him to be mad at me
- Kate doesn't respond, clearly disturbed
52
'  - '  - Kate gets out Of the minivan, but Esther stays put'-in her seat
Rate sighs, frazzled and distracted
Esther, come on
told you,  don't like the de ntist
There's nothing to be afraid of
- know
Because 'm not- going- Esther, get out of the cart Righ t now
For a moment, they just glare at each other
Mexican stand-off
Then Esther sticks her nose in the air and does as she's told
-'  -   -- The  lowers Esther back in the chair, pulls on rubber gloves
The  clips a dental bib around Esther's neck
She hasn't had a check-up in about two years, so she's a little nervous
- she doesn't look to me
Now let's have a look at those co ppers
Esther just looks at the ceiling with her mouth tightly shut
Come on, darling, open wide
-Esther eyes him anxiously; then reluctantly opens
Just a bit
That a girl: Little wider
She opens more
He leans in to take a look
Suddenly, she SHdMPS dawnn his jinx s hard Pnou h to draw blo-mss fr and locks i12n like Rottweilei12] The Hygienist is frozen in shock
Aaagh
Goddammit
Help me with her
The Hygienist holds her down while the Dentist tries to pry her mouth open
Finally, he yanks his fingers free, cradling them 53
painfully
Esther  at ldm like a cat, lips flecked with blood
The Dentist and Hygienist exchange a startled
lock

Kate bits waiting
The Hygienist enters
- Mrs
Coleman
Kate gives her a confused look
Then she notices Esther htanding behind the Hygienist with a-smug grin on'her face

'  - Driving home
Kate stews, on her last frayed nerve
Esther gazes out the window, seemingly oblivious, singing a little nonsense song under her breath: "La-la-la, la-la-la-la
La--la-la
" Kate stops at a traffic light
Glances outside
She's stopped next to a
Kate quickly looks
away, her temptation real enough to startle her
The light turns green and she drives off without looking back
Esther keeps
few blocks later, they pass a
Then a bus shelter with a big
Kate probably drives by them every day, but now they're popping out at her, sly old enemies that never really left, re-emerging from the shadowy recesses of her mind
She tries to focus on the road, Esther's  grating in her head
"La-la-la, la-la-la-la:
La-la-la, la-la-la-la
" -- Kate and Esther enter
Esther skips upstairs
Kate sighs, angry and frustrated
She plays a message on the
(
0
) Hello, this is Sister Abigail calling for John and Kate
Please call me as soon as you get this message
have
something that we need to discuss in person
It's regarding
Esther
Esther stands at the top of the stairs, listening to-the message- She's heard everything
And she's scared
Scared and pissed
'
- Kate and John get ready for bed
He's been our dentist for ten years
Why would he lie to us
54
didn't say he's lying
just think Ws-blowing it out of proportion, saw the bite marks
We're lucky he's not suing us
Fine, but  don't believe for a"second that she just did it for no reason
That's because she's always on her best behavior with you
' That's
not true
've had to deal with her at her worst
- What you think is her worst is what she's like with me all the time
She's completely- different with me than she is with you'
, So you've seen her haul off'and bite someone like an animal
No, but she threw that fit at school Yeah, because the other kids were harassing her
It's the same thing here
(off her reaction) She's from a completely different culture Kate
She has to be taught that this
behavior isn't appropriate but there's nothing malicious about it
If'she says she bit him because she was scared and he was hurting her,  don't see any reason not to believe her
beat
Kate looks at him
She's stewing hbaut something
So should
1 believe her when she says you've been hitting on Joyce Patterson
' (taken aback) Did she say that
t
55
] Is it true
of course not
Did-she invite You over
' She wanted me to help her move a chair
Oh, - come on
All right, she was obviously coming to me
But  shut her down
Then why didn't you tell me
Because  knew how you'd reactl Really
You sure it wasn't because you were coming-on to her so obviously that an eight-year-old picked upon it
long-beat
John sighs, resigned
- How-long are you going to keep this hanging over me
It was ten years ago
You keep-saying that
But it's only been about two years since you told me
(a tense beat) Having another child was -supposed to bring us together
'm sorry  didn't tell you-about it- x just feel like 've earned a little trust here
- don't know what you expect from me
might never completely trust you again
Not like before
gave you a second chance
i124 56
Kate stops short
IIis words-are like a phybical blow
-  - That's not fair
So-you can keep bringing uP my
mistakes over and Over, but we're not even allowed to discuss yours
was sick
You were just an asshole who wanted to fuck somebody else
You were a danger to our children
If didn't want to
make this work, could have left months ago and nobody would have blamed me
Nice
Is that-what-your mother told you
Angry tears well in her eyes
He realizes be went too far
Kate goes into the bathroom and  the door
'  -  - It's late
Esther and Max sit on the bed in their nightgowns
Only the bedside light is on
They're signing to one anothe r
Comm
'
' 1 Max anxiously nods her head
Esther smiles
' '- The room is dark
The girls sneak in, still in their nightgowns, and close the door
Esther turns on a :reading lamp
' Look for the key to the treehouse
' -Max nods and they start searching the room
Esther rifles through John 's desk
- Nothing
She looks in a closet with Two  on it catches her eye
57
Max opens a
keepsake chest and finds   on:a ring
She excitedly shows them to Esther
Esther smiles and takes them
As they're about to leave,
Esther
Uses
She looks back at the- closed closet
Then looks at the keys
Max eyes her curiously
Esther slides a chair over to
the closet and opens it
She stands on the chair, pulls down the case with the padlocks on it, and sets it on the floor
She tries a couple of
keys
Then --
There's a  inside
shiny revolver and a
Esther's face lights up
She
carefully picks up the gun{-turns it over, looks at it
Max's eyes nearly pop out
Esther gives her a sly look, then loads a single bullet,
the cylinder
and points the cmn at ax
Ri
aht between the Bye Do you -want to_ play
- beat
Max shakes her head
Esther smiles, fingers the trigger
After a long, awful, pants wetting eternity, she lowers the gun
You're right
We'd better not
() Not yet
- -- Sister Abigail sits across from Kate and John with a grave look
When you first asked about adopting Esther,  expressed some misgivings
But  wasn't completely straightforward with you
You see,  love children
've worked with them my entire life
And the thing about love is that it sometimes clouds your judgement
() But the truth is that  knew there was something wrong with Esther from the moment  laid eyes on her
Kate sits up, concerned
John bristles
- You said you suspected, some kind of abuse
Yes, but there was something else
It was hard to say chat it was at first
Just-a feeling that she was a profoundly damaged little girl
() 58
' (' ) (beat) s eemed Then  notaced that she - always k_ to
be around whenever ther' wwasa get kind of trouble
- Two girls iii a fight
And there she'd be
Someone would get caught stealing
And ell she'd - myself it Was But never really
believed it
(beat) l who After you told me about the gir broke her arm, -: -started wondering again
called the achool:Esther went to while she was with the Wallaces and asked if there'd been any serious accidents while she
Was there
One incident was still fresh in everyone's minds
boy in one of her classes was stabbed in the throat with a pair of 'scissors
All the kids-who saw it happen said it was an accident, that he was running with the scissors and fell
But once again, Esther, was there
- is eavesdropping from around the corner
She slips away
But none of these things were her fault
That's; g  was reluc
tant to t anything bef ore
Now' think th at may a have been a mistake
(off their-looks) Children like Esther, who've spent their entire lives-in institutions, have never had' a chance to 'form normal, lasting bonds
The longterm effects of 'this- can be devastating
In the very worst cases, children who fail to form early attachments are unable to learn the difference between'right and wrong
They can lie, cheat, steal --- or worse -and and have no remorse whatsoever for their actions
' They view other human beings as objects, pawns for their amusement
And they can-be potentially very dangerous
'  - white s gloves, like she's Esther pulls on -a pair of
dinty hurCh services dressing for morninga 59
- '- JOEt7- This
doesh't sound like Esther at all
severely character-disturbed child can appear to be -completely normal, -even exceptional
It's like they have two faces one-they show the outside world in order'to get what they want, and the other, their true face, lying just beneath the surface
'  - Max sits on her bed, wearing a jacket and clutching her "Bello
Kitty" backpack
Anxious and waiting
Esther enters
- - E5T_HBR Let's go
-  - What about the orphanage in Russia where she was raised
Wouldn't they have been able to tell
- 've put in a call to the director there, but she could have easily slipped through the
cracks
- So the bottom line here is that you don't have proof of any of this
That's true,- don't
But  believe the circumstantial evidence is enough to warrant taking the next step
Which is what
- - Get Esther out of'the house
Kate and John are stunned
You want to disrupt the adoption over this
- 60
- If 'm-wrong, she-can come back home
But you need to get her to a therapist who can tell you what you're dealing She's just a kids - She's also the sole-survivor of a house fire that killed her last family
(off their looks) It was arson
did some checking
Someone deliberately set that fire
They-never caught who did it
Wait a minute, you're not suggesting -- Pyromania is one of the warning signs of a character--disturbed child
Rate blanches, realizing: Do you think she had something to do with'what happened to Yolanda
long beat
Sister Abigail hesitates, reluctant to answer
- The thought that a child could cougnit such a monstrous crime flies in the face of everything  hold dear
But in my opinion, at'a a possibility that you need to take very seriously
-
Esther slides the door open -on  rails and steps inside
Walks over to John's workbench
Looks at the   above it
- Kate and John are stunned by what Sister Abigail has told them
We can take her to Doctor -Browning
- Kate suggested doing that weeks ago
But  don't want to send her away
Not without at least some kind of proof
Sister Abigail
sighs, frustrated
Kate turns to him: 61
But what if 'the doctor says she's dangerous
beat
He considers, uncertain and emotional
JOH1 Then  guess we
won't
bave any choice
- Daniel sits near
the brook, sullenly throwing rocks in the water
He hears something behind him and turns
Esther and Max are running off through
the woods, leaves  under their feet
' Neither of them ree him
He eyes them curiously
- Sister Abigail ie leaving
Rate and John stand by the front door, 'troubled, watching her go
-- Esther and Max run toward'the bridge where
the road into the neighborhood crosses the brook
They climb an embankment and crouch
by the bridge abutment, out of breath
Esther looks both ways
There's no traffic
She and Max hide behind the abutment
/
'  - Sister Abigail drives away
, troubled
She takes a pack of cigarettes from the glove compartment and lights one
- The girlb wait by the abutment
The only sound is the brook
Max looks nervous
Esther gives her a reassuring smile
- It's going' to be fine
Just wave your arms and make sure she stops
Max nods
Then Esther hears a  coming
She peers out'from behind the abutment
It's Sister Abigail's car
Esther quickly ducks out of sight
Here she
comes
Wait until she gets close
Max nervously peers out from behind the abutment
Esther stands behind her
The car starts across the-bridge
Suddenly -- -- sthe pusbes Max it into the Load
stumbles and falls ri ht ,m
on of the _speedi12 car
62
Sister Abigail gasps and  on the brakes, ' , stopping the car mere feet from where Max lies in the road
She frantically
jumps out of the car and kneels next to Max
Dear Lord
Are you okay, honey
Max looks up at her,-stunned, but unhurt
Sister Abigai1 is taken aback
She recognizes her
- Max
- - falls on Abigail from behind
She turns and looks "up
Esther looms
over her, a   raised above her head
efor is a Abigail Va e a , Esther angrily hits her in tie ' l head as hard as she can with the hammer
#
Max startles,'eyes wide with shock
Sister Abigail falls and lies twitching on the pavement
Eyes staring blankly, one pupil wide from the head trauma
Blood trickles from under her headdress
As Max stares at
the body, paralyzed with fear, Esther scurries into Sister Abigail's car and finds her purse
She flips through her wallet
Cash, credit cards
Takes it all
Finds her rosary beads
Grabs them, too
Then she hurries back to the body
Help me get her off the road
Max looks up blankly, then staggers
to her feet
They each take a hand and start dragging Sister Abigail's body, but she's heavy and they're little
It's all they can do to slowly move her
Then Esther hears something
There's   coming
It's still out of sight through the trees, but closing
Esther and Max hurriedly drag the body, struggling it to the side of the road, just as the car rounds the bend
Esther gives the' body a kick,, sending it rolling down the embankment
The car is almost on them
Esther and Max quickly hide under the bridge
Esther grabs Max's backpack and pulls u wig _cm
The car reaches the bridge
Esther listens to it cross, tense, gun
ready
but it passes Abigail's car and continues without stopping
Esther breathes a sigh of relief
Suddenly, there's a CROARING_noise from behind them
' Esther turns
It's Sister Abigail
She's still alive
She's trying to speak, but all that comes out is an awful'
Esther scowls and grabs the hammer
Sister Abigail looks up at her,' moaning louder
Then Esther brings-the hammer down
The moans stop
Esther hits her  and

Max shakes her head, pale and shivering
Good
Let's get her covered up
Esther starts scooping leaves and debris onto Sister Abigail's corpse
Max just watches fora long beat
then shuffles over like a zombie and helps her
Esther smiles
- Esther is wearing a clean dress
-- She stuffs Max's "Hello Kitty" backpack under the looUe floorboard where Daniel
used to keep his weed
Max is huddled in a-corner, still dazed
As the y talk, Esther laces the bloody from Sister"ibigails car i a lastic grocery bag s ade ties kit
off
If you tell on me, you'll get in trouble, too
,
That doesn't matter
'They'll send you to jail just for helping me bury her
Max starts to cry
Esther moves closer, comforting
She wanted to take me away from you
() Now we eau be together forever
-- Daniel heads home on the path through the forest
Be hears a up ahead and sees Esther and Max emerge from the treeh ouse
He quickly hides

selling a SpongeBob popsicle from a cart the SpongeBob pop as
the vendor hands it to a little girl

It's Esther
She smiles  at the
vendor and walks away
She- spots the Homeless Guy across the park and casually heads toward him
As she approaches, we see that she's carrying the -plastic yrocery bag with the bloody hammer and sister Abigail's things in t
She carefully looks around to snake sure nobody is watching, then nonchalantly tosses the incriminating bag into the Homeless Guy's shopping cart and keeps walking, sucking on her SpongeBob pop
'  - Rate hangs up the phone and turns to John
She's canceling some appointments-so we - can get her in-tomorrow
They hear Esther  upstairs and exchange a disgiuieted look
-- Esther
-Her black velvet ribbons have been removed and laid out in a row on the counter
'   to the bathtub, where Esther is taking a bath
The water is faintly red

Esther and Max
You saw them
Oh-huh
The treehouse is still locked
Esther had the-keys
You mean these keys here
He goes over tothe keepsake chest and opens it
The   is there
He holds it up
Daniel flusters
You're not lying to get them in- trouble,
are you

No,  swear
(sighs, exasperated) don't know what's got into you lately
Just go to your room
Daniel leaves, dejected
and trudges upstairs

Alone now, John looks at the
key ring, considering
Be goes to the closet, looks at the'gun case
Takes it down
Unlocks it
The gun
is right where it belongs
He sighs and closes the case
'  - Daniel is in bed, sound asleep The doorknob turns, the door open
Someone sneaks into his room, approachinbglh1ss-bbed

Kate and John) You can come on in- '  - Dr
Browning's manner is serious
Kate and John sit, anxious
- ' o Well, let's start with what youca me here for
You don't have anything' be worried about with Bsther
John breathes a sigh of relief
Kate gives-a dubious smile
She's not dangerous
No, of course not
Thank God
It's
not all good news
You do have a serious problem in
your home
() But the real issue is with you, Rate Kate reacts, stunned
67
'  -  - Esther
fidgets, impatient
She turns to the Secretary: May  go to the restroom
'
- Dr
Browning continues
Kate' can't believe what 'she's hearing: was able to coax her into admitting that there's been some tension between the two of-you
She's really tr
ing very hard to please you
The problem is that you're blocking her attempts-to attach-with you
That's why whenever something bad happens, you blame her, whether it's really her fault or not
But that's not what's
been happening
doubt you're even aware that you're doing it
But subconsciously you t aunt her to be bad because' demonizing her is your way of covering your own feelings _ of inadequacy as a mother
don't feel inadequate
But you do have doubts
You worry that' you Could relapse
What does that have to do with'Esther
Frankly, everything
Your guilt over what happened with Max is preventing- you from bonding with Esther
Kate turns to John, aghast, but he's taking this very seriously
It's made you doubt your fitness as a mother
And that terrifies you
So you're having trouble with Esther, alonV comes Sister Abigail with these stories about her being some kind of monster and you believe them because () 68
(
') it f s easier than with yojW fear ,that there's something hwrong th you
What the hell did she tell you
Let's not m4ke this about herana m a d dne real progress with her today tell you with complete certainty that Esther is not to blame here

Esther clutches her head, rocking back and forth

You just have to learn to be more patient
You're really very lucky to have her
: Esther's fit has passed
She neatly composes herself and emerges from the stall
and sees that there's a  at the sink
She eyes Esther warily
Probably heard everything
Esther hesitates , then walks right by with
her nose in the air
- John pulls the car in out of the
They get out and Esther
goes Inside
When Kate is sure she's out of earshot: Thanks for the support back there

Hey, 'm not a psychiatrist

Kate glances up, sees Esther crouched on the stairs, watching
fAMiLY  - Daniel sits in a big recliner, sullenly playing a   - -
Kate is researching- on the Internet
We get of some of her Google
results,  Ctfs with Daniel at alien baddies, his face angry and intense: "Character-disturbed Children

" Esther enters holding Max's handy leadin her around like a pet
Max numbly follows
They walk up to Daniel'in the recliner
We want to sit there
Esther, Daniel was there first
- Daniel eyes Esther
Wary, but defiant
She sighs and makes a -"cutting" motion with two fingers
Daniel brusquely turns off th e game and gets out of the chair
- As' he leaves, Kate calls out, Daniel
Daniel
He ignores her and stomps upstairs
She watches him, concerned
'  - Kate shows John some pages she's printed out from the Internet
This is what Sister Abigail was telling us about
Character-disturbed children, 'Look at the, symptoms
() "Superficiallycharming
Difficulty making and keeping frinnds
Cruelty to pets
Bossy and controlling
Overly affectionate with strangers
" "Extended period of bedwetting
Speech pathology
Abnormal eye contact
" She doesn't have half of these
still think Doctor Brow have missed something
iner couldd () 71
(') have just told her what she wanted; to hear
Look
(flips ages, reading) "Character-disturbed children are adroit manipulators
They can be exceptionally charismatic, oftentimes playing people off one another to get what they want
" save you showed this to Doctor
BAowiiing
(hesitates)- 'm not 'seeing her anymore
You're not going to therapy
When did you decide that
When do you think
John sighs
tense-beat
know you were
upset
But we have to at least consider the possibility that she's right about this
No, we don't
Why does everybody around here get the
benefit of the doubt fro m you except me
That's not true
'm just
worried about you, that's all
We can hire someone to help you with the kids if it's getting to be too much
don't need help
All  want is for a doctor who knows what they're doing to give us a second opinion
: '  - All the lights are out except for the   in the aquarium
Bather is touching up the      we saw when -we first met her, but we can't see what she's doing to it
The black light causes some of the paints on her palette to fluoresce
John and Kate's  carry, up through the heating vent: 72
We're-not going to
keep taking her to doctors until you hear what you want to hear
- That's not what 'm trying to dal -want this to work just as much as you do, but there are
serious questions
that we still don't havethe answers to
If Sister Abigail was right about Esther,
then people are dead because of - She didn't really believe that
She didn't want to believe it
But she was worried enough-to think we should put her in foster care until we found out for sure
For all, her good intentions, sister Abigail was not a trained psychologist
She'had certain suspicions about Esther and they turned out to be wrong
Why is can't you accept that
(a beat, thin)ts) What if somebody else thought there was something wrong with her
Like the director of the orphanage in Russia
Esther stops painting and listens, suddenly apprehensive
if it's a dead end, 'll drop it
- But if they say the same thine, then we'd have to get
a second opinion
John considers
He doesn't want to be unreasonable
He nods
All right
- See what you can find out
: Esther' fumes
She angrily throws her painting across the room
rNT
'  - John-is shaving with his shirt off
He sees Esther in the reflection, slyly watching him
She smiles at him
73
Will, you take me to school today
You'll have to get ready early, = don't mind
- Kate is on the
phone
She has pen and -paper ready to take notes
Sister Judith
Hi, this is Kate Coleman
teas
wondering if you'd heard from anyone at the Sludianka Orphan's Shelter in Russia
sister Abigail said that
- Oh, you did
_ (listens, troubled) What do you mean
Well,  don't understand
How could they not have any record of her being there
() Yes, please
Call me the moment you hear anything
Thank you
She hangs up, disturbed
'  - John drives
Esther rides next to him
She  and he realizes that she's holding back tears
What's the matter
don't want to go to school
Why not
hate it
Nobody likes me there
Nobody ever likes me
She stares forlornly out the window
Big sad eyes
John sighs
You want-to play hooky
(off her look) can call in- sick and we'll go to -the zoo
What do you think
Esther smiles through her tears
74
'd like that very much
r Kate drives up the steep hil1 in front of Daniel and Esther's school and stops at the end of a long'line of parents dropping kids off
Daniel
gets out without looking at Kate
Daniel, wait a minute
He hangs back
Rate gives him and Max a concerned-
look
- How are you guys getting along with Esther
- , Daniel freezes
An apprehensive look passes between him and Max
Fine,  guess
Does she ever make you guys feel uncomfortable or do things you know she's not supposed to
Has she ever hurt either of you
Daniel wants to say something, but the frightened look on Max's face stops him
Rate realizes she's struck
a nerve
Please
You can tell me anything
- gotta gu
Before Kate can stop -him, he closes the car door and runs off
-- John and Esther walk by the  exhibit
- She takes John's hand and presses it to her cheek
You don't know how-long 've waited for a 'daddy just
like you
And a monany, too
Right
Esther hesitates
John notices
She gives a sad shrug
don't think
'Tommy likes me very much
75
John is taken aback
An awkward beat
- That's not true
- Mc=my loves 'you
It's all right
understand if she doesn't
It must be difficult to love an adopted child as much as- your own
Sweetheart,
you are just as much a part of this family- as Danny
and Max are
Mommy doesn't love'you any less because you're adopted
Do you understand
She nods, but doesn't look convinced
John thinks
Why don't you do something special for her
So she can see what a good girl you are
'll bet she'd like that
Esther's face brightens
That's a wonderful idea
think know just what 'm
going to do, too
- After dinner
Kate is loading the dishwasher
John is brig ing in dirty dishes from the dining room
Esther enters, all smiles
Hands hidden behind her back
John gives Kate an expectant smile
have a special surprise for you, Mommy
Kate eyes her warily
No idea what to expect
You do
- picked this flower just for youl It's Kate's memorial orchid
Kate gasps
John is horrified
Kate reaches for the flower
Estherl Put that down --l Esther laughs and playfully pulls it away
Kate grabs her by the wrist and Esther suddenly drops the flower,  in pain
76
- You're,hurting me
's eaction
Esther runs from the room,-cr her wri wrist- e ying, and startled clutching Esther What the hell did you do to her
just grabbed her arm
aohn hurries after Esther
Kate hangs back, picks the orchid-up" from off the floor
it's ruined
- Esther sits
on the nofa, still crying
john comforts
her
Kate looks in on them
John shoots her an angry look
- Darkness
Esther slips inside, closes the door, turns on a light
Goes to the workbench
There's a  bolted to it
She finds some rags and wraps them around her wrist where Rate grabbed her
Then she places her wrist in the vice, puts the handle of a between her teeth, and bites down on it
She takes a couple of deep breaths and sta s clo in the yicg of her are
Grimacing in agonyy screwdriver clan ed between her teeth against the pain, she twists the vice tighter and tighter
- Rate sits at the table
John has calmed down, but is still angry
She knew what it meant to me
She did it on purpose
, It wasn't even her idea
(off her look) 'm the one who told her she should try to do something nice for you
He leaves
" '  - It's late, The room is dark
Esther plaintively calls out: Daddy
Daddy
77
The door opens
John,
blearily -enters in his pajamas
what in it, sweetheart
My arm huits
' - - Okay
Let me see
He turns on a bedside lamp and sits on the bed
She pulls up
hex` sleeve, cringing
Heir wrist is mottled with -   -- camera flash
Esther is in a hospital gown (still wearing her black ribbons) while a   photographs the bruises
,
--   - Rate and John sit across from a harried
An x-ray of Esther's arm is clipped to a light box
_ It's a hairline fracture in her radius
swear,  barely touched her
() You'll need to talk to the social - worker about that
She's going to come in here- and ask you some questions
But
it was just an
accident
It's routine
We're required by law to file
a report
Child Protective Services will be in touch to schedule a follow-up visit at your home
Kate is shocked
John shoots her a dirty look
-- Home from the hospital
It's very late
The kids are wearing coats over their pajamas
Esther's arm is in a fiberglass cast
John is carrying Max, who has fallen asleep
As they start upstairs, Kate reaches out to John
He hangs back
Daniel and Esther go to their rooms
When they're gone: 78, You know  would never hurt any of the-
kids on purpose
know
It's not what you do on purpose that scares me
Kate watches him go
Be turns away and takes Max upstairs
1 -  - Kate site curled up on the window seat by the planter, holding the wilting orchid and sobbing inconsolably, old wounds re-opened
''  - Dark
John is asleep, alone in the bed
The door is ajar
Esther appears in the
doorway
She peers in, watching him sleep
After a beat, she gathers her courage and quietly enters, tiptoeing toward the bed
She pulls back the covers and
climba in next to him
John doesn't stir
Esther curls up beside him
'  - It's raining
Rate sits in the parked van
No sound except the roof
She's looking out at something
It's the   she drove by earlier
She's-parked in front of it, staring at it through-the rain-streaked windshield
- Kate puts     on the counter
The  rings them up
She's anxious, guilty, already hating herself
We're having guests over for dinner
The Cashier nods
Like be gives a shit
Kate lowers her eyes
- - The two wine bottles sit on the kitchen counter
One bottle is
open, a  already poured
But Kate's not drinking it
She's just standing these, arms folded, looking at it
The house is
quiet
She's alone here
Only her demons to keep her company- long moment of
awful indecision passes,, Kate paralyzed
Then she looks up, her gaze moving past the wine glass to the window
, Through it, she can see the backyard
It's the swimming pool that holds her eyes, its cold-surface rippling in the rain
But- she's seeing something else there, something awful
Impossible to know- what she's thinking, but whatever it Is, it moves her to action: 79
She, abruptly grabs the glass and quickly empties it in the sink before she-can change hex mind
-Then she grabs the
open wine' bottle and pours it all down the drain
She runs the water and scrubs the sink with her fingertips, removing every trace
Tosses the empty bottle in the trash and ties up the garbage bag
- Kate hurries out in the rain and stuffs the kitchen trash in the garbage can, burying it under-another bag
-  - Kate re-enters, dripping wet
There's still the other wine bottle
The unopened one
She 1}esitates
' '  - Rate's
in the walk-in closet
She hides' the wine bottle in a cubby in her shoe rack and turns out the light
'  -- Driving the kids to school
Kate looks drawn and weak
Daniel and Max stare off into space
Esther holds a stack of her paintings in her lap, obliviously prattling: can't wait for show-and-tell
hope Mrs
Grosse
likes my paintings
did one especially for her
Nobody responds
Kate's blocking her out
Esther doesn't mind
/
'  - Kate drives up the hill and pulls to the curb
Daniel gets out, but'Esther struggles, her wrist cast making her clumsy, and she awkwardly fumbles her paintings
They land in the gutter and start-blowing away
She gives Kate a horrible,-pleading-look Moumiy
My paintings
Kate eyes her accusingly
You dropped them on purpose
No,  didn't
swear
- Kate doesn't believe it for a second, but sees a and a   hurrying to grab the paintings as they're carried off by the wind
Kate shoots Esther a dirty look, then sets the parking brake with an exasperated sigh and gets out to help

- Rate sits across from John and Dr
Browning
The mood fa grim: set the brake
Bven if  hadn'tr the police said it wouldn't have

But Max says she didn't see Esther do anything wrong
Max is cover
ng for her
And  don't think it's the first time
It also-wouldn't be the first time that you've tried to blame Esther for
something that was really your fault
This
isn-'t all in my head
Sister Abigail was right
There is something wrong with Esther
And  don't care anymore if  can't prove it
'want her out of this house
John and Dr
Browning exchange a dark look
' So you're at a place where you would actually let somebody take her away
'll do whatever  have to,do to protect my children
56 will 1
(re: Dr
Browning) That's why she's here
something in his voice makes Kate apprehensive
An uneasy beat
have an opening held for you at a residential rehabilitation clinic about forty-five miles from here
They specialize in extended treatment for women who are relapsed alcoholics
Kate is stunned silent
She gapes at
them
with a mix of anger and fear, unable to stop' a flash of guilt
How much do they know
82
What are you talking
about
- 'll stand by you through this for as long as it takes
My mom'a already agreed
, to 'help look after the - kids
Tell her not to bother
(to Dr
Browning) 'd like you to leave now
Kate, don't
John stands and takes something from inside the sideboard
Ile : sets it on the coffee table between them

Kate is stricken
She looks at it like it was a poisonous spider
The girls found it while they were playing in your
closet
The girls
" You mean Esther found it
Yes, Esther found it
Does that make a difference
Is she lying
beat
Kate's silence-is answer enough
didn't
bought two bottles poured the other one down-the sink
But not this onie
Again, no answer necessary
Kate looks defeated, tears welling
'm not going to rehab
'm not going to leave you-alone with the kids again until you do
-
haven't had a drink in almost a year
John sighs, frustrated
- Dr
Browning intervenes, her voice infuriatingly even
and calm
' 83
Relapse is very common in early sobriety
We can help you
But not until you drop the charade
- It's not a charade
wanted to- drink i t
You have no fucking idea how
badly wanted to drink it
But  didn't
(off John's look) know 1 should have told you
was just afraid of what you'd do
wanted you to come to me
That's why , didn't confront you with it last night
If Max had gotten hurt this morning, it
would've been because trusted you tell me if there was a problem
What happened this morning had nothing to do with this
l f ow do you expect me to believe that
Max and Daniel are the only reason 'm still sober
would never do anything that would hurt them
You don't think this behavior effects them
You know damn
well what 'm talking about
_ Her voice is brittle now, barely controlled
beat
The tears sta rt to spill
When  look out at the pool and think
(to John) When  try to imagine what would have happened if you hadn't come home early that day
it makes me want to kill myself
would the before  let something like that happen again
Then why-not throw both bottles away
84, - Becauso" need help
i thought  could handle it myself, but  can't
'll go back to-therapy
'll start going to meetings
That's not enough anymore
'  told you last time what 'd do if this'ever happened again
'm trying to give you another chance
- You haven't heard
a word 've said
've heard enough
If it was just the two of us, that would be one thing
But  can't let you be in a position where you could hurt the kids
'm not the one you need to be worried aboutt Seven people close to Esther have died in the past year
Max was almost the eighth
now many more coincidences are you willing to ignore
Kate, stop it
You're talking about an eight-year-old girl
And right now she's making a lot more sense than you are
know  haven't given you any reason to believe me
But you have to
'm begging you
'm sorry
Maybe if you'd been honest with me from the start
But not now
-- peer around the corner, watching them argue
Max is crying
You either check into rehab this week or  leave and  take the kids with me
Esther leans close and whispers into Max's hearing aid: 'll kill her it you tell
85
Max gives her a frightened look
- Just then, Doris
appears with a bowl of popcorn
She quickly ehoos the girls away
Come on, you two
Let's go watch
Max wipes her eyes
Esther takes her hand and leads her away
--  - John walks Doris out to her car
-He gives her a hug
- You sure you don't mind
She's not going to appreciate your being around
don't care what she appreciates
You can't leave those kids alone with her while you're at work all day
(off his look) You're doing the right thing
Don't let her change your mind
'll see you tomorrow
Doris gets In her car
John looks conflicted
- Bedtime
Esther can be heard  through the closed bathroom door
Daniel listens as he sneaks down the hall in his pajamas
'  - Max's eyes are red from crying
She's drawing a picture, but hides it under some other papers when Daniel enters
Be closes the door
Esther's  can be heard
tense beat
Are you okay
' Max nods
Daniel sits down next to her
He lowers his voice
Did Esther do something to the van
Max turns away and shakes her bead
It's okay
You can tell no
saw her jump out before
it started to roll
Max gives him a startled look, suddenly frightened
86
:
3ER
No way
Dad won't believe me
You have to do it with me
Max shakes her head and starts signing, but Daniel can't keep up
Slow down, ' don't understand
Did she make the van crash
long beat
Max reluctantly nods'
- Then we have to tell Mom and Dad
Max starts crying
She signs, but Daniel doesn't understand
Frustrated, Max starts hitting him
Daniel grabs her arms -Stop it
- She's going to kill us if we don't tell
Morn and Dad can protect us
Max
shakes her head
Daniel releases her
Why not
Daniel stops short
Max hesitates, then gets up and shows him the pictures that she hid from him when he first came in
They're crude crayon drawings of Max and Esther
In the first, Esther stands atop the rocket ship slide and pushes Brenda down the stairs while Max watches
The= next one turns Daniel's blood cold
&'s of Sister Abigail's murder
Esther stands over Sister Abigail with a bloody hammer wh e r e Max cowers under the bridge
The last one is of Esther and Max in the treehouse
Esther is covered in blood
What did she do in the treehouse
Suddenly, Esther's
"humming
Daniel looks up, alarmed
r She's coming
87
'Max quickly hides the
pictures-
Daniel scrambles to the door, but -pauses and signs to Max as best he can
Everything's going to be all right
'  - Daniel hurries back to his room and closes the door, just as Esther emerges from the bathroom
She pauses, suspicious
'  -r Kate and John are in bed
It's 3:23 a

' They both appear to be sleeping
Then Kate
moves
She's still wide awake
She looks over at John, slowly push the covers back, and inches out of bed so that he doesn't wake u es' p
She quietly dresses
tIPSTAIRS  - Kate emerges from their bedroom with a small   and cree ps into the dark hallway, careful not to make any noise
She stops by the
door of Max's bedroom, and slowly opens it
'  - Kate slips inside, closes the door; and starts toward Max's bed
- Suddenly, a desk light comes on
It's Bather
She's been sitting there in the dark
The light casts strange shadows on her face
Going somewhere, Kate
Kate startles and whirls to check on Max
She's
fast asleep
She's fine
Lot's not wake her
What are you doing in here
1-couldn't sleep
was-afraid you might try to take Daniel and Max away
Kate stands frozen, frustrated and'angry
Go to your room
() Honestly, we're past that now, aren't we
86
t 'um not going to let you hurt my children
- 1m not the one who passedouutt drunk
and let hear the first step is (on
ffideannttially) -admitting that
you have a problem
(a beat, stricken) Who told you about that
- Esther holds up Kate's journal:: Kate blanches
It's in your journal
found i12it a few weeks ago
It's very intimate
3 learned so much about you
Your marital troubles, your drinking problem
Where you hide your wine bottles
You have lovely handwriting, by the way
Would you like to bear my favorite part
Esther has a page marked
She reads: "Eight weeks before my due date, Jessica died-from several undiagnosed birth defects
hadn't felt her move for days, but now that  knew she was dead,  started-to feel her kick again
It's called phantom fetal movement, like the pain felt in a missing limb
was an amputee and my baby was the lost part of me
Because of other complications, Doctor Kosgrove didn't want to induce
So  had to wait to go into labor
For sixteen days  carried Jessica's body and felt her ghostnow a kicking in my-belly
y womb coffin and inside me slept a corpse
" (to Kate) How perfectly hideous
No wonder you turned into a nasty, smelly drunk
Kate is dumbfounded, trembling with impotent rage and raw emotion
Kate
You don't know how lucky you are, 'll never have children of my own
My father paw to that while  was still-in diapers
actually don't"remember a 7 time when he wasn't fucking
me
() 89
('  ) (off Kate's look) don't want your pity
' He did it to make me strong
So 1 ,wouldn't turn out weak and 'pathetic like you
'mi pot weak
Please
You're soft
Like,& worm
Losing your baby could have
made you stronger
But for you it's alwa s
more therapy and more- pills and more booze
Anything so that you don
't have to actually face the so state of your miserable existence
And why should you
You've got John to carry your dead weight around
But you know something
You don't deserve him
And sooner 'or later, he's going to figure that out
Esther stands up to leave
Kate-blocks her path
What are you going to do
Hit me
-Kate
looks really tempted

She puts out her hand for the journal
Esther gives it to her with a smile
Kate steps aside
See you tomorrow
She leaves
Kate glares after her

She curtly hangs up- - Doris plays a game with the kids
Esther feigns' nonchalance, but
the tension is thick between Dani

Doris is oblivious

Its dress has been flipped up, revealing ,g slit, cut in he doll's pack

Something has been hidden in the stuffing
Tt's a 'i12 Bible
Kate pulls it out and quickly looks through the pictures that-Esther keeps inside
They're the same photos of the Wallaces that we saw earlier
With one new addition
It's the missing page from Esther'

But the face that Esther cut out, from the other picture has been glued over Kate 'a

It's the same Gothic mansion from Bather's paintings

Kate gets up and rushes into Daniel's room in time to see the Nurse cover his body with a sheet
Kate collapses to the floor, weak with horror and grief

Then slowly, Kate's eyes turn steely and her grief burns into rage
She pushes
John away and stands up

He waits for Dr
Rajan and the Nurse to leave, then walks over and looks,down at Kate
She's fighting to stay awake
Mom's driving us home

Kate weakly grasps his hand, her voice a thready whisper: John
Please
Please don't let her take my family

John hesitates, conflicted
Then he places her hand back on the bed and turns away
She tries to call out, but doesn't have the strength
- She sees the girls waiting in-the hallway
Max has been crying
She looks scared
John leads them all away
And the last thing Kate sees-before blacking-out again is Esther's devious smile
-  - flashes in the distance
There's a storm coming
'  - John tucks Max into bed
When he leans down to kiss her, we see Esther watching from the doorway
Max eyes her warily
What's wrong, sweetheart
- She's thinking about Daniel
(to Max) Aren't you

Max reluctantly nods
John gives her a sad look

Esther enters and stands next to john at Max's bedside

After -a thoughtful beat, she starts cutting its rufflesoff
- Esther's  can be heard
John trudges downstairs,
exhausted and emotionally devastated
He-goes into the, living room, slumps in a chair, buries his face in his hands, and cries
, revealing the unnoticed answering machine in f

The light on it is
One new message

Kate stands in rthede
doorway
The bed Daniel was lying in is already-empty and as if -he was never here
streaks down the window
]Cate enters and sits down heavily next to the bed
She touches the place where her son lay dead only bourn before
She brehks down and sobs inconsolably, but we can't hear it, only the of Esther's lighthearted, melodic tune
103
- Back to
John sits on the sofa, eyes red anti teary, watching a videotape-of Daniel pla'irig soccer
There's a from the kitchen
Be_pauses the video, listens
moment later, $' starts vlayin3
An old, crackly recording from the forties of The Ink Spots singing "' " Sentimental, bittersweet, and a little creepy
Baffled, John goes to the kitchen
- and stops short at what he sees
Esther stands on a chair, cutting slices of cheese with a -She's prepared a plate of fruit, cheese,-and-crackers
She's wearing the dress we saw her choose, but with some alterations
The ruffles are gone, so are-the sleeves
It's low cut and too grown up
Her hair is perfectly curled and her face is caked with makeup --- powder, red lipstick, thick mascara, dark eyeliner -- giving her a grotesque, woman-child, eight-year-old- beauty-queen look
JonBenet Ramsey by way of Angelina Jolie
John is stupefied
She szailes at him
Outside,
4 Hello, darling
What are you doing
- - Making you a snack
You skipped your dinner
Get down from there
That knife's too sharp for you to be playing with
Esther climbs down from the chair and nonchalantly carries the cheese and cracker plate to the dining room, as-if he hadn't said anything
John follows her, dumbfounded
- There are   and a bottle of   on the dining room table
Dim lighting and romantic
John is completely nonplussed
'Esther sets the cheese plate on the table
What is this
- 104
-- wanted to do something special for you
don't like my daddy to be unhappy
- But why are you dressed like that
$ Don't you like it
No,  don't
- You're not supposed to play with Mommy's makeup
'm sorry, sir
just want to be as' pretty for you-as she is
You don't need makeup to be pretty
Esther is touched
She gazes up at
him lovingly
You really mean that, don't you
of course
Why don't you go wash your face and we'll tuck you back into bed
- But-1 worked so hard
Can't we stay up just a little longer
She gives him the big, sad eyes
They're a little disconcerting under all the makeup
John sighs
' -All right
We'll have a little snack and then off -to bed
Esther beams
John sits down, reluctantly humoring her
Esther starts pouring sparkling water into the glasses
We really
should be drinking that bottle-of wine, but  couldn't find it
Little girls aren't allowed to drink wine
'm not so little
To family
105
She raises a glass in toast
: John gives her a sad look, but goes along with it
They- their
glasses together and drink
But
instead of sitting down,'Esther continues to stand next to 'him
She picks up a piece of cheese and tries to feed it to him
John eyes her uneasily'
'Be takes the cheese from her
and eats it
Why don't you sit down
like being close to you
She gazes into his eyes and
touches his face
John moves her hand away, suddenly very uncomfortable
She hesitates, nervous
then eans saes Qn h
John grabs her arms and abruptly pushes
her away xn-shock and near-panic
What's wrong
Don't ever do that again
thought you loved me
You said  was pretty
Of course,  love you
But not
it's different than how  love Mommy
You're my little girl
Will you stop saying that
We can be together now, don't you see
She can't come-between us anymore
Who can't
You mean Mommy
She's not my inormyl Please, sir, 'll do anything for you
She reaches out to touch his face again, but he grabs her hand
Esther, stop it

This is wrong
Am  being bad

'll let you
won't, evn cry
Unless you want me to
106
John gapes with-disgust and horror,
He looks like he-might vomit
God ouoin beat
Esther looks heartbroken
Suddenly, she tries to kiss him again, desperate this time, throwing herself at him, pushes her to the floor
She frantically crawls back to him
Be hurries to the other side of the table
Please

Kate's mind is reeling
This can't be

Does she have the scars
What scars

She glares at her reflection, her mascara smeared down her cheeks

Veera murdered them both

With her scars revealed, her face scratched, her mascara streaked down 'to her chin, and her awful, yellow, snaggletoothed sneer, she looks like a monster
