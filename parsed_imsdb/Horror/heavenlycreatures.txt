The hymn finishes
Sit
Everybody sits

All the class have name cards hanging around their necks denoting their chosen "French name

The imperfect subjunctive, like the imperfect indicative, indicates action in the past

"He wanted her to give him some money
" (Angry) Put your hand up
will not have girls talking out of turn in my class
The door opens and Miss Stewart brings Juliet into the room
The presence of the headmistress causes the class to stand up
Good morning, gels
(In Unison) Good morning, Miss Stewart
The class sit
Miss Waller
class
this is Juliet Hulme
Juliet is joining us from St
Margaret's, and prior to that she spent some time at Queenswood in the Hawkes Bay
Juliet looks at Miss Stewart haughtily
am actually from England, Miss Stewart
Of course
Juliet's father is Dr
Hulme, the Rector of the University
Miss Waller looks impressed
Pauline is quietly drawing horses at the back of the class
Juliet's travelled all over the world, and 'm sure she'll be very eager to share her impressions of exotic lands across the seas with the gels of 3A
'll leave you to it, Miss Waller
Juliet
Miss Stewart leaves
Miss Waller smiles at Juliet
You can sit over here, Juliet
Miss Waller gestures to a desk at the front
She gives Juliet a cardboard name card
We use French names in this class
You can choose your own
Miss Waller returns to the blackboard and starts writing
Now, irregular verbs in the present subjunctive
"qu'il vienne"
Excuse me, Miss Waller
you've made a mistake
Miss Waller turns to Juliet-who now has the name "Antoinette" hanging around her neck
"Je doutais qu'il vienne" is in fact the spoken subjunctive
It is customary to stand when addressing a teacher
"Antoinette
" Juliet stands
You should have written "vint
" Miss Waller frowns, glances at the board, and hastily rubs out the offending word
(Embarrassed mumble) Oh
must have copied it incorrectly from my notes
Juliet stands again
You don't have to apologise, Miss Waller
found it frightfully difficult myself
until  got the hang of it
Miss Waller turns to Juliet, her face clouded with anger
The class looks terrified
(Icily) Thank you, Juliet
Open your text-book to page 17
Pauline is smirking
: - The teacher,
, comes in, carrying a pile of paper and a box of paints
She starts to distribute them around the tables
Right,  thought we'd do some life drawing today
Pair off into twos and decide who wants to model and who wants to draw
The girls around Juliet turn to each other, seemingly eager not to be partnered with her
They pair off and Juliet is left alone
Oh, Juliet
you haven't got a partner
That s all right, Mrs
Collins
'm sure  can manage without one
Mrs
Collins scans the class
Pauline
are you with anybody
Pauline shakes her head
Good
You can come here and pair up with Juliet
Pauline reluctantly comes up to Juliet's table
of  showing   sketching their partners
Most of the posing girls are seated in contrived positions with rigid grins on their faces
Mrs
Collins patrols the class, commenting to different girls
You might want to change the colour- make it a bit darker
that's very nice, Joan
to reveal Pauline's "pose"
slumped in the chair, arms crossed, a sullen look on her face
She stares intently at Juliet, who is drawing furiously
but doesn't refer to Pauline at all
Good heavens, Juliet
What on earth is this
Mrs
Collins picks up Juliet's drawing
It features an armoured knight on horseback, fighting a dragon
St
George and the Dragon
Mrs
Collins studies the detail in the drawing
Where's Pauline
Oh,  haven't gotten around to drawing her yet
was going to pop her on a rock, but  seem to have run out room
Juliet glances at Pauline
Sorry
don't know if you've noticed, Mrs
Collin but 've actually drawn St
George in the likeness of world's greatest tenor-Mario Lanza
Yes,  know it's very clever, Juliet, but when  set you a topic,  expect you to follow it
Now put that down and start again
Mrs
Collins moves on
Juliet looks up at Pauline rather grumpily
Pauline leans forward, an intense look on face
(Whispers)  think your drawing's fantastic

She pauses, wide-eyed

Pauline puts her bike on its stand
She pulls the Mario Lanza album out of her bicycle bag
Pauline is about to approach the house when she glances across the garden, and is transfixed by an enchanting sight: Juliet on a sunlit bridge that spans the Ilam stream
She is wearing a shredded chiffon dress, with a Christmas tinsel crown and a necklace made from tinfoil
Sunlight filters through the trees, lending Juliet a magical quality
She's casting flowers onto the water
Pauline stands transfixed
Juliet sees her and smiles
Hi, Paul

He is dressed in a "prince's" costume

Jonathon runs away
Juliet gives chase, yelling to Pauline
The evil Prince Runnymeade is escaping
Get him, Paul
Pauline joins in the chase after Jonathon, careening through garden and bushes
Juliet and Pauline lose sight of Jonathon
They pause in a clearing, catching their breath
The blighter's gone to ground

Jonathon drops from a tree, onto Pauline, sending, her sprawling
He whacks her on the bottom with his wooden sword
God

Hilda looks up as Juliet bursts into the room from the garden, followed by Pauline
Hilda smiles at Pauline
Hello
Jonty broke Paul's record
Oh, dear
We must buy her another one
Juliet drops to the floor, hauling records out of the radiogram cabinet
Pauline looks around, taking in the sumptuousness of her surroundings: ornate fireplace, paintings, antique furniture
Would you like a cup of tea
Paul
No, thank you
Well, Juliet's told us all about you
hear you're fond of opera
Before Pauline can reply, Juliet fans Mario Lanza albums across the floor
Which one shall we play
Pauline shrugs awkwardly
Henry looks up from his papers, rather annoyed at this intrusion
Pauline notices a row of beautifully sculpted Plasticine horses adorning the mantelpiece
Juliet puts a record on the turntable
Juliet
your father's trying to study
Daddy can study while we're playing records
Why don't you go back outside, mmm
'll be finished soon
The record drops on the turntable
The arm swings across

Dying breath escapes from Pauline's mouth
she goes limp
Juliet shrieks
(Crying) Paul
Juliet collapses over Pauline's body, crying
Pauline's eyes flick open
She sniffs and pulls a face
Urrrgh
You've been eating onions
Before Juliet has time to react, Pauline pushes her off, giggling maniacally
She leaps to her feet and attempts to run
Juliet grabs Pauline's cardigan, pulling her backwards
You toad
Pauline sheds the cardigan and runs through the bushes, with Juliet in hot pursuit
Juliet tugs at Pauline's blouse and the buttons pop off
Pauline is laughing too hard to run anymore
She pulls off her skirt and waves it around her head as she dances around the bushes, singing "The Donkey Serenade
" (Singing) "There's a light in her eye, Though she may try to hide it, She cannot deny, There's a light in her eye
" Now Juliet is cracking up at the sight of Pauline spinning around in her underwear, shoes and socks
Pauline circles around and around Juliet, singing
Juliet hurriedly starts undressing down to her underwear
Juliet giggles and starts jumping up and down
Pauline suddenly breaks into a run and races through the bushes
Juliet follows
Both girls are screaming and hooting loudly
Pauline and Juliet burst out of the bushes and

They find themselves face to face with a , mending a fence
without missing a beat, they continue singing

" then break down into convulsive laughter
They turn and flee back into the bushes
Mario Lanza picks up "The Donkey Serenade" at the point that Pauline and Juliet stopped
The song builds to a rousing final chorus as
Pauline and Juliet collapse on the ground, rolling and tumbling in an embrace
As Mario sings the last exhilarating notes

Bricks have been stacked to form a miniature temple, decorated with flowers and tinsel
Pauline and Juliet are kneeling on the ground, clipping pictures from film magazines
Clipped-out photos lie scattered about
Pauline holds James Mason's photo
(Enraptured)  wish James would do a religious picture
he'd be perfect as Jesus
Daddy says the Bible's a load of bunkum
Pauline reacts with a degree of shock
But, we're all going to Heaven
'm not
'm going to the Fourth World
It's like Heaven, only better because there aren't any Christians
Pauline giggles
It's an absolute Paradise of music, art and enjoyment
Pauline is entranced
Juliet plucks up some photos
James will be there

Only they'll be saints

This is really quite incredible

In an alcove beside the gate, the Plasticine figure of Diello is lurking in the shadows, dagger in hand
Beside him is the rope winch that operates the portcullis
Footsteps approach
Diello presses himself back into the corner
Nicholas walks briskly
As he nears the portcullis, he espies something twinkling on the ground
Nicholas stops, looks down
Directly above him are the jagged teeth of the portcullis

It is lying on the ground, as if dropped by somebody
Diello slashes the rope with his dagger
Before Nicholas can react, the portcullis crashes down on him
His Plasticine body is crushed
Nicholas's twitching fingers release the brooch

Your daughter's

All those nights she spends over-she's assured us that you don't mind
It's rather more complicated than that
Since Mrs
Hulme and  have returned home, Juliet has been behaving in a rather disturbed manner
surliness, short temper
general irritability-most uncharacteristic

Hulme

Your daughter appears to have formed a rather

No

She doesn't answer
Or is it because you want to be with Juliet
No answer
Do you
like girls
No
Why not
They're silly
But Juliet's not silly
(Emphatic) No
Yvonne
there's nothing wrong with having a close friend, but sometimes things can get
too friendly
Such associations can lead to trouble
It isn't good to have just one friend

But what about the vomiting

Dr
Bennett shrugs
Physically,  can find nothing wrong

can only attribute her weight loss to her mental disorder

Mario Lanza singing "You'll Never Walk Alone
" explains what happened subsequently: In the hours following Honora's murder, a police search of the Rieper house unearthed Pauline's dairies
This resulted in her immediate arrest for the murder her mother
Juliet was arrested and charged with murder the following day
After Pauline's arrest it was discovered that Honor, Rieper had never married
Pauline was therefore charged under her mother's maiden name of Parker
In August 1954, a plea of insanity was rejected by the jury in the Christchurch Supreme Court trial and Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme were found guilty of murder
Too young for the death penalty, they were sent to separate prisons to be 'Detained at Her Majesty's Pleasure
' Juliet was released in November 1959 and immediately left New Zealand to join her mother overseas
Pauline was released two weeks later, but remain New Zealand on parole until 1965
It was a condition of their release that they never again

Illustrations (c) 1995 Paul Hamlyn Writing and Directing Heavenly Creatures Talk with Frances Walsh and Peter Jackson Peter Jackson and Frances Walsh were both born and raised in Wellington, New Zealand
Jackson's first film, Bad Taste 1988), was made by the director over a period of several years while he was working as a photo apprentice at a local newspaper
Jackson's two following films, Meet the Feebles (1990) and Braindead (1992), were co-written with Walsh and Stephen Sinclair; the latter was a hit on the film festival circuit, winning 16 international prizes including a best picture award from the Academy of Fantasy, Science Fiction and Horror
Jackson and Walsh (who had previously written for episodic television in New Zealand) co-authored the screenplay for Heavenly Creatures, which went on to garner nominations for both an Academy Award and a Writers Guild Award
Their latest collaboration is The Frighteners, executive-produced by Robert Zemeckis and starring Michael
Fox; it will be released in 1996
Jackson and Walsh live in Wellington with their son, Billy
The version of Heavenly Creatures published here is a final draft, completed in March 1993
The screenplay was 107 pages long
Fran, my understanding is that you were the first to become interested in the Parker/Hulme murder case as a film subject
It seems to be a popular topic in New Zealand
Frances Walsh: Well, popular topic-'m not sure about that
But it's certainly a piece of New Zealand criminal history that has entered into the realm of myth
And as a young girl growing up,  knew about it, and had read lurid newspaper accounts- "Lesbian killers' rampage"
: Yes, yes
And  also got my hands on a novel called Obsession, which  read when  was about 14
thought at the time that it was extremely good
[laughs] It takes a very damning view of the girls-it's written by two English journalists who came out here to cover the trial
It was something of a hack job that set out to sensationalize the case
And there was also a play, wasn't there
: Yeah, there's been a play, and there have been nonfiction books written about it
There's also been a great deal of coverage over the years in newspapers and magazines, so it's always had a profile here
Since it had already been treated in all of these different ways, what compelled you both to explore the subject again
Peter Jackson: Well, we didn't really think it had been treated that well
Nothing that we had read did we particularly like
And also, the other various treatments all seemed to have a specific agenda, which attempted to make political statements about the murder
What interested us was to show these two 15-year-old girls with no other agenda than to be as accurate as we possibly could, and to somehow imagine what was going on inside their minds
know that all of Pauline's voiceovers from the film are from actual diary entries
You made an interesting comment awhile back about how they actually informed the structure of the film
Could you elaborate on that
: Well, the structure was fairly apparent once we started to do research
It wasn't just the diaries themselves, it was the general research
We read as much of the diaries as we could-we haven't actually ever seen the full, unedited diary-but we gathered as many of the excerpts that were releasedat the time of the trial as we could, which amounted to quite a few pages
And we read the newspapers, and interviewed people, and then the three acts sort of materialized quite neatly
You know, act one is when the two girls meet and become friends, and the turning point is at the end of the first act when you realize that they are now bonded
: It's when they have their first delusional experience together at Port Levy, where they go into the Fourth World
You know these two girls have an imagination that's going to lead to something interesting happening
The second turning point comes with the decision to murder Mother, which tips the story into the third act
Whom did you interview to cull together all of this information
: Well, we went through about 35 or 40 people
We wanted to interview as many people as we could find
Several refused
We talk to about 15 or 16 of their classmates, which was experience
These were 55-year-old women spread out around the country, and they all had changed their names because they'd gotten married
It was quite a detective job to find them
read somewhere that the school was not particularly enthusiastic about this; did they help you locate the ex-students
: No, the school didn't want anything to do with it
Christchurch Girls' School had erased these two girls from their history
The yearbook that had the class photograph with Pauline is no longer available
If you go to the school library, they have all the yearbooks available apart from 1953's, which has her photo in it
It sort of cleansing of the books
The school didn't recognize what it was we were trying to do, which was to redress the issue
Why wipe these girls off the school records
mean, they were human beings
: Peter and Jim Booth, the producer of the movie, went to see the headmistress of the school, and after they explained what we wanted to do, and allowed her to read the script, her only comment was, "Why can't you make a film about pupils of whom we are proud
" : We also heard from several sources we interviewed that on the day after the murder happened, the headmistress at the time stood up in front of the assembly and said, "No girl is to discuss a certain matter
" This was, like, the day after two of their pupils had murdered somebody, and they couldn't even refer to it directly
Forty years later, we got the sense that the school was exactly the same
And that really gave us all the more reason to make the movie, because we felt that these people were still living in the 1950s
We found that with a lot of the people we interviewed-that even though 40 years had gone by, they were still presenting attitudes of the '50s: this was some dark, sordid little thingthat was best kept quiet and should never be mentioned
Many times we got, "Why on earth would you want to make a film about this
" We should just forget about it, and hope it will somehow disappear
" And we actually thought about doing that
But within 20 or 30 years most of the people connected with it will be dead, and at that point in time we'll never know anything about it
We felt it was a good time now, while there were still quite a few people alive, to do the interviews and try to get something accurate, for the record
We were also aware of the responsibility we had, because film is such a persuasive medium, and we knew that, unlike any other medium-the newspaper accounts, the play-itcan give an audience visual images, which, in a way, almost replace the real event, especially if you weren't born at that time
So we thought if we made a film now, perhaps people in New Zealand would look upon this case in a different way
That was a responsibility we felt that we didn't want to take lightly
Pertaining to that quest for accuracy, how does one go about reconstructing, for instance, conversations between Pauline and her mother, or other scenes for which there is no direct documentation
: Well, all you can do is attempt to find out as much as you can about the people involve-the type of people they were, their class background, etc
So to that degree, we spoke to people who knew the Riepers, for example, who had good knowledge of the girls
Did you interview any of the boarders in the Rieper house
: Yeah,  did, very briefly
We found one of the boarders, who spoke to me on the telephone
did the interview, and then the following day  called him back to ask him some more questions and he clammed up; he didn't want to talk to me anymore
He'd obviously gone home to his wife, and she'd wound him up about the whole thing and told him he shouldn't be involved with it
:  think our understanding when we set out to write this was that we would never be able to re-create the right interiors, with characters who precisely reflect the people who were really there
Our intention was to be true to what we understood of the girls' friendship, and the nature of that friendship and the nature of those families from which those two girls came
It was never an attempt to re-create reality
We could never do that, obviously
So we went into those things with the spirit of trying to reflect the situation, rather than reality
: The Hulme family were a lot easier to research than Pauline's family, because the Hulmes were public figures at the time
Henry Hulme being the rector of the local university, there were obviously a lot of university people we could talk to professors, students-who worked with him
Hilda Hulme was also quite a public figure
They were, in some respects, the royalty of Christchurch, because the English class system was and still does exist down there, and they all take these things quite seriously
There used to be garden and tennis parties at Ilam, and there were a lot of people who had social contact with the parents and Juliet at the time
The research actually carried on through the shooting of the film
remember when we were in England, auditioning actresses for the part of Juliet before we found Kate Winslet, and we found out that [the late] Anthony Quayle, the English actor, had actually visited the Hulmes in Christchurch in the '50s, so we tracked down his wife and spoke with her
The research just kept on going all the time
We had trips to Christchurch to do our research, but once we started working on the film, we moved there for nearly five months, so it was an ideal opportunity to find others
We'd hear things about this person who had sat next to Pauline in typing class, and we'd rush around to see them
'm sure the production got a certain amount of notice in the local media, so people probably approached you
: To an extent, but not as much as what we had hoped
Pauline's people were actually quite difficult to research, because they just weren't public; they were quite private people
: We have heard, subsequently, that Pauline's sister, Wendy, has seen the film
She still lives in Christchurch
Her con meets were that the film managed to capture the atmosphere of her home at that time, but her criticism was that the family was "better" than that, we had portrayed them in too shabby a light
And that really touched me
: She thought that the portrayal of the tension between Pauline and her mother was very accurate
It was nice, because Wendy is one of the few key people alive who refuses to talk about it
She absolutely refuses to have anything to do with journalists, with anyone, so it was actually very sweet of her to get the message back to us
It was quite amazing to us that she had even gone to see this film
She thought it was good, but incredibly difficult to watch
In gathering all of this material, 'm sure there were certain things that didn't "fit" dramatically
Was there anything you were tempted to use but didn't, because it was either too sensationalistic or too ethically questionable
: There was one area we deliberately steered clear of that we felt ultimately didn't have a relation to what we were wanting to tell, and that was that in the Rieper household there was actually a younger sister, named Rosemary, who had Down's syndrome, who is still alive; Wendy still looks after her
At the time of the murder, Rosemary was only 8 years old
This made Honora's life all the more difficult: the daughter lived in a special home, and would come home on the weekends
Pauline writes about Rosemary a lot in her diaries; she was very fond of her
But it was one area where we felt that we were being too invasive into the privacy of this family
As you say, there was quite a bit of stuff we had to leave out for structural reasons
Pauline's diaries are very, very funny
We ended up using a lot of the more dramatic material in the movie, in the scenes in which she's talking about murder and suicide, but unfortunately we had to leave a lot of the funny things out
She records hilarious conversations that she and Juliet had, and it's all very witty
Sometimes we used diary entries and just dramatized them, as opposed to using a voiceover
Like the sequence where they go into the Fourth World, where the hilltop changes into a magical landscape
That is described in detail in the diary
So it was a case of having to be very selective, and at the end of the day, it was the more dramatic selections that made it through to the movie rather than the funnier stuff
The girls ' sense of humor does manage to come through in the film, though
'm thinking, for instance, of the last scene in the Rieper house, when the family is having lunch with Juliet before the two girls and go to Victoria Park
Were their snide comments about Sir Edmund Hillary in the diary, or were they invented by the two of you
: That was out of our imagination
We were told that they were extremely jolly at that last meal-it was actually in the court records-and that they were cracking jokes, and saying silly, outrageous things, on a sort of giggly high
And we knew that Wendy had worked at Farmer's, the localdepartment store, and also what had been very big in the news that year was Sir Edmund Hillary, a New Zealander, climbing Mt
Everest
He had been knighted, and became a huge national hero; he still is
Because he'd also spent time in Christchurch, we felt that this was an appropriate thing for them to send up, because whatever they did, they were terribly irreverent
If the Queen was visiting, for example, they wouldn't bother to go out unless it was to take note of the decorations, the pomp and ceremony, to enrich one of their own royal celebrations
They really had no respect for the icons of the day; their interior world was much more important to them
The film critic for Time, Richard Corliss, likened you to a "physician who assumes a patients fever in order to understand her illness
" At what point did you two decide that this was going to have to be presented from the girls' point of view
:  think from the beginning
That was one of the motivations for doing it
None of the accounts we came across were from the girls' point of view
Like we'd said before, they all had other agendas, so we felt that telling the girls' story was important
It did take us a long time to be able to do that, because it took us a long time to learn who they were, and what was driving them
We were a bit confused-there was a bit of mystery at the beginning-but the more we read, the more we talked to people, we gradually began to formulate who these people were
Ultimately, there was a lot of Pauline that  could recognize in myself, which was very useful
You, too, Fran
:  felt that the diary: offered the first insight into the friendship, and into Pauline in particular
It was an extremely interesting account of her life, documenting both dramatic and mundane events with a great deal of literary flair
She was a very imaginative, funny and clever young woman who had some quite pretentious ideas, as teenagers do, and  warmed toward her immediately
Reading the diary made me wonder about the huge discrepancies between this young woman and the monster who was portrayed in the newspaper accounts and everything else
And  thought it would be great to take that journey to find out who she was
Because no diary of Juliet's survived-we have heard from people that she did keep a diary, but it was destroyed- thought it would be harder to get to know her, but that really wasn't the case, because she appeared to be someone who more readily shared her life with people; she was much more of a social creature than Pauline
So it was a combination of the private world that they shared and the understanding that we got from talking to their school friends, inparticular, that gave us insight into the nature of these two girls and the way they appeared to the rest of the world
think it's fair to say that both Peter and  felt hugely sympathetic toward Pauline and Juliet, and we did start to identify and empathize with them, all the while trying to keep in balance the knowledge of this terrible act
It was that dynamic, of really liking them, but feeling abhorrence at what they'd done, that kept the thing alive for so long in our minds, and gave the film inner life
Peter, your camera work, in all of the films you've directed, is extremely dynamic
In 'Heavenly Creatures,' the almost hyperactive camera seems to have an organic relationship to the girls' euphoric state
've noticed in this script that a lot of these camera directions are written in, with more detail than most other screenplays 've read
Do all of your scripts read like this
: In this particular screenplay, camera movement came quite readily during the writing stages
At the end of the day, the script is not the document we want to go out and sell; it's the document that the cast and crew have to read
When we write a script intended for me to direct, it's right from the beginning a shooting script; a document for technicians to use
You know, the grips put a circle around the word "" so they remember on that particular day of shooting they're going to have to have it on the truck
With this movie, probably more than any other 've done, the camera moves were integral to the scriptwriting
'll tell you where that came from: the music
We read very early in our research that Pauline and Juliet were both obsessed with Mario Lanza
Neither of us were familiar with his music, so we went out and got some of his records, and before we started writing we played through them and came across several songs that we really liked
One of the very first ones we heard was "The Donkey Serenade"- : Well, we knew that was important to them because Pauline had named one of her novels "The Donkey Serenade
" : When we heard it, just the life and vitality in the song immediately indicated Steadicam
[laughs] It immediately told you you had to have a moving camera
We chose all the songs that were in the movie, and, in the case of "The Donkey Serenade," wrote scenes around them
found it a great visual tool
It's never happened before in anything 've done- mean, 've never had the music in advance
We had these songs playing while we were working to get ourselves psyched up to write a scene
At the same time, the music helped me visualize, so that visualization ended up going down on the page
Of course, once you actually arrive on the set, and you have the actors and the camera people there, things can change
don't regard anything that's written into a script in terms of a camera direction asbeing locked in stone
How long did it take the two of you to finish a first draft
: Not really long
think the first draft was written in probably 10 or 12 weeks
But we didn't start to write until we'd uncovered several months' worth of research
And the draft we're publishing is the shooting script
: Yeah
think that's about draft number five
We did an interesting thing
We did a certain amount of research first, while we were still working on Braindead [Dead Alive in
], and then we wrote the first draft from the position where we felt we knew some of the facts, but there were a lot of gaps
We thought if we wrote a draft we would know where the holes were, and we would know what we had to pursue in terms of research
For instance, Fran and  had never been down to Christchurch when we wrote this first draft, and Christchurch is such an integral part of the story
Then we made the trip down there before the second draft and were able to modify a lot of things, interview lot more people
We actually did that on purpose, because we wanted to nail the story before overlaying it with a lot of historical detail
How do the two of you handle writing collaboratively
: Well, it depends
You know, if Fran's working on some re-writes while we're shooting, and 'm on the set, she'll show me some work that she's done when  come home and we'll revise it together, but generally, when we're actually writing the initial drafts of the script, it's always together
think that we both have a good understanding of structure, which helps, and 'm obviously very visually oriented, and Fran is very good on dialogue and character, so we complement each other quite well
think the best advantage that we have in writing scripts together is that we write a script that  go and make, which is,  think, a wonderful thing
It would be a strange experience for us to write a script that someone else was going to make, because we've never actually experienced that loss of control that so many other writers have
So right from the very beginning, it's a movie
It's not a piece of writing that's going to go out to the marketplace and may or may not sell
Just one little thing
Even though Heavenly Creatures was very much written by the two of us, my favorite scene in the movie was written by Fran by herself
Which one is that
: Well, it was late one night, and we were hoping to finish the first draft of the script-it was, like, ten o'clock already-and we had arrived at the sequence in the tearooms where they're having their last cup of tea before they walk down the track
We sat there wondering how on earth we were going to write this scene
We knew they'd actually gone there to have tea because we'd spoken to this very elderly woman who had served them
She said they were talking quite calmly to one another
But what dialogue do you put in their mouths at this particular moment, when this woman's about to be murdered
Well, the phone rang, and  got up to answer it and ended up stuck on this call for about 45 minutes, and  came back and Fran had written something
She asked me to check it out, and it was never revised: it's where she slides the plate with the last cake over to Honora, and says, "Go on, Mother, treat yourself
" It was perfect
know you found Kate Winslet at an audition in England
How did you come across Melanie Lynskey, who played Pauline
understand she was not a professional actress
: Well, it's one of those stories that sounds like it's not true
We wanted to cast someone in New Zealand, and we'd auditioned a lot of people-five or six hundred-who were either videotaped or photographed
wanted to find someone who was young, around 1S or 16 years old;  didn't want a 23-year-old in a school uniform
And we wanted someone who was physically very much like the original Pauline;  have a thing about being as accurate as possible
So we quickly exhausted the professional actors in New Zealand who happened to look like Pauline-there's only about one or two
[laughs] We knew we were looking for someone with no experience, but we just had to find them
We kept saying, "Somewhere in New Zealand there's somebody who's perfect for this role
"We were actually about four weeks away from beginning shooting, and we had one or two people on the short list, neither of whom we were happy with, but we were coming under enormous pressure to cast one of them, because, you know, the wardrobe department needed to make costumes, and so on, and Fran said to me, "You're not really happy with the choices, are you
" And  said, "No
" And she said, "This is crazy; we've spent all this time and energy on this film and we haven't found Pauline
This is something close to a major tragedy
"  was in Christchurch, so Fran decided to drive with a casting person around the lower half of the North Island of New Zealand-she was prepared to drive as far as she had to
They'd visit every small town, go to the local school, visit the principal's office and show a photo of Pauline Parker
She'd say, "We're making a movie about Pauline Parker; do you have any pupils in your school who resemble her who might be interested in this
" : We were in a rusting Ford Cortina, and we had no official
We'd roll up to these provincial schools, and we'd be greeted by some curious teacher
Although no one ever once questioned our authenticity, we would always get asked about the car: "If you're in films, why aren't you driving a Porsche
" [both laugh] So then  would pitch the story to the entire classroom, scanning the room the whole time, looking for sullen, brooding school girls, all the while thinking, "What would she look like with her hair dyed black
" :  guess that went on for about a week
Every night 'd get a call from Fran
Anyone that was vaguely appropriate was videotaped, and  got a couple of tapes in Christchurch, and it was a bit depressing
Finally, Fran called from a small town called New Plymouth, and said, " think 've found someone very interesting
' And this was Mel
We flew her down to Christchurch and gave her an audition and a screen test, and we cast her two weeks before the film started shooting
called her mother up on a Friday night and said, "'d really like Melanie to do the film
" And she said, "When does she have to start
" And  said, "Well, she's got to come down here on Sunday
" The poor girl didn't even get a chance to go back to school to clean out her locker
Do you think there was any correspondence between the two actresses and their backgrounds and those of the characters they were playing
: One of the things that we knew about Pauline was that she was incredibly witty and intelligent, and Melanie was very similar-she was the top student in her province in many subjects
And we knew if we cast an intelligent person, then they were going to hit it
Melanie's also very enigmatic
The character of Pauline doesn't have an enormous amount of dialogue
In a sense, the real Pauline Parker speaks for her, through the diaries
So what we were looking for was an actress who has that kind of aspect to her that's a real movie-star thing: where you can film somebody sitting in a room, doing nothing, and they're still fascinating to watch
We found that in Mel
've read that you used actual locations for some of this
: As much as we could
The only location we couldn't use was Pauline's house, which had been torn down
Fortunately, the school is now a community center; the actual school moved to a different location, so they no longer had control over the buildings; otherwise we'd have definitely been refused permission
The school buildings are now owned by the Christchurch City Council, which has done nothing to them; they're as they were 40 years ago
They just rent out the various rooms to community groups
We found out what classroom Pauline and Juliet actually were in, and it was the Canterbury Women's Embroidery Guild-it sounds like something out of Monty Python-and we went into the room and right down one length of the wall was this huge tapestry that had been stretched out on this massive frame
thought they would never want to take it down, but we managed to get them to do it
So that was the actual classroom where they were, down to the seating
The Ilam house, where Juliet lived, is still there
It's owned by the university, and they were very happy for us to use it
As for the doctor's surgery, where Pauline is interviewed by the doctor, we found out the address, and-you know, this is 40 years later, so you have no idea what to expect-it was just, like, a suburban house
We thought that was strange, in that it didn't seem like a doctor's office
Anyway, we knocked on the door, and the woman who answered happened to be the doctor's daughter-the doctor's long since dead-and we asked her where her father's office had been, and she said, "Oh, he had rooms out the back of the house here; we've never really touched them
" We went into this doctor's surgery which was almost exactly the same as it had been 40 years before
So we ended up filming those sequences in the actual room where Pauline was interviewed by the doctor
We also spoke to the woman who was working at the tearooms at Victoria Park and found out exactly where they sitting, and filmed that scene there
Actually, about two months later, that building was demolished
And what about the murder scene
: Well, we went to the murder site, and we just felt uncomfortable about filming there
It was very strange, and maybe it was just our imagination, but it was very quiet, very tranquil
mean, all the way down the path you hear the wind and the birds, and suddenly, when you arrive at the spot, you hear nothing
So we filmed the murder scene at Victoria Park, but it was on a different track, about a hundred yards away
There is one sequence of scenes in this script which didn't appear in the film
it begins with the tennis party at Ilam, in which Pauline and Juliet are watching from behind some shrubbery as Walter Perry and Hilda Hulme play tennis
: Well, that sequence was actually shot, and exists in the version of the film that was screened here in New Zealand
When Miramax released the film in the
, they had screenings and felt that the film was too long
We had final control over the film, but they pleaded with us to take out about 10 minutes' worth of footage, convinced that it would be tighter
We looked at it, and we actually, ultimately, agreed with them in a funny sort of way
That sequence slows the momentum down
It's quite a fun one to read-and it's fun in the film as well-but it does slow things down at a point where we didn't think things should be slowing down
Although we've had control over the film's release all over the world, we've requested that the sequence be cut out of the versions screened in every other country
When you're writing a script, a part of you thinks, "Oh, this is perfect, we mustn't change a word of it," but once it's finished it takes a life of its own
We felt that the sequence wasn't telling us anything wedidn't already know about the characters, and at a time where the tension in Pauline's house was really growing, going over to Juliet's house to watch a tennis game was not necessary
:  think when we wrote the script we felt it was very much Pauline and Juliet's story
After the edit, however, it became very evident to us that it was Pauline's story which was the through line and the audience's focal point
Whenever we veered too much into telling the Hulme story and Pauline wasn't on the screen, the pace started to flag
That was something we had to look at after the first assembly-we had to trim and cut Hulme scenes because they weren't as fundamentally interesting as the Rieper scenes
Although this film is very different from Braindead, both take place in the New Zealand of the 1950s
'm not that familiar with your country, but from watching these two films  would have to assume that it was, at least in that period, a fairly repressive kind of society, acting almost as a breeding ground for transgression, for explosive kinds of behavior
: Well, the script for Braindead was set in the modern day up until the very last minute
was worried going into the movie that the hero of the film, named Lionel, acted in a fairly nerdy kind of way-he doesn't socialize, he takes care of his mother-and yet we wanted him to be the empathetic character in the film
was afraid that if it was set in the modern day, the audience-especially a young audience-would really jeer at this character, and not be able to relate to him at all
If we set it inthe '50s, people might actually feel more sympathy for him, because they would think, "Well, that sort of thing happened then
" With Heavenly Creatures, it was really just a coincidence that the actual event had taken place then
: But that repression is still very much in evidence here: we're  not expressive, we're not demonstrative, we're scared of showing, saying too much
When you go to New York, for instance, and people are yelling and the horns are blaring-if that happened here, someone would get out of theircar, rip open your door and bash you up
There's a level of violence, a subtext of violence, running through New Zealand society that comes out in our movies
We have a veneer of being easygoing, but underneath, we're full of rage
It's an interesting social dynamic
and it makes for interesting art, but it's not so pleasant to actually live in it
It's very much to do with a link with England- : Christchurch in particular
: Christchurch suffers from it more than any other city in New Zealand
It's always been described as "a little piece England"; it's considered to be more English than England
It's always aspired to be that, and it still is in some ways
: The thing with this murder, too, is that the sense you when you talk to the older generation in Christchurch is that it was an embarrassment to the city, that it was somehow shameful and somehow humiliating
Which is ridiculous, because the story is ultimately a family tragedy
: It's been said that Christchurch was more appalled by revelation that Pauline's parents were not married than by the murder itself
And some uncharitable souls even suggested that one sinful act led on to the other
Speaking generally about your films, you both seem to have a certain love of campiness, which is apparent in the use of caricatures for many characters, as well as in an overall sort of extremism reminiscent of the work of someone like John Waters here in the
What's interesting about Heavenly Creatures is that while it remains a fundamentally "realistic" docudrama, some of the figures of authority, like the doctor, the vicar and the headmistress, are hilariously overplayed
: Well,  like movies to be entertaining, to be a little larger than life
With something like Braindead, obviously there's no problem doing that
But with 'Heavenly Creatures,' we were telling what we hoped would be a fairly accurate story
At the same time, however,  still wanted to make a movie;  didn't want something totally tied to real life, and totally dull
So we did have a little bit of fun with some of those characters
guess if you were trying to justify it you could say we were presenting them from the girls' point of view, but that's not strictly true
just think that there were really only two people who we needed to be realistic with, and they were Juliet and Pauline, both of whom were slightly larger than life anyway
That's something that came across in the interviews with their classmates
They were remembered as being sort of terrifying: Juliet was so confident and loud, and Pauline was brooding and dark
So, in a sense, the film was a perfect one for us
don't Like doing stuff that's totally naturalistic
just like having a little bit of fun
The fantasy sequences are written pretty much as they appeared on film
Were you aware of how, technically, you were going to handle these special effects as you were writing
: Pretty much
We hadn't used any optical or digital effects in Braindead, and with Heavenly Creatures,  knew that if  actually wrote digital effects into the script, then it was a great excuse to go out and get this new equipment- have my own special effects company
So right at the beginning we wrote stuff that could only be done with morphing
We got one computer and hired someone to figure out how it all worked
What about your use of the Plasticine figures
Was that something you'd heard the girls were interested in
: Yeah, we interviewed several people who remembered that they used to model figures in Plasticine, and  think Rieper refers to it in his court testimony
We also interviewed an old guy who had been round to the Hulme's place and had seen Juliet's Plasticine horses on the mantelpiece
And, of course, there are endless passages in the diaries about Borovnia, and Diello, the murderous prince and all of that
When we thought it would be fun right at the beginning to go into some of these fantasy sequences, the last thing  wanted to do was dress up actors in medieval costumes and crowns and have them looking like something out of a school play
So we decided it would be really fun to tie the Plasticine figures and Borovnia together
And we knew they'd sculpted figures like Diello, so we just thought, why not have those figures come to life, as it were
What about the linking of certain actors to certain figures, like Orson Welles to Diello
: Well, that was something that we devised ourselves
But again, that springs from the fact that the girls used to give pet names to people
Like one of the boarders in the diary, for instance, is referred to as John for a while, and then his name changed to Nicholas
That's referred to in the scene in Pauline's sleepout
: Yeah, and for some reason, Pauline refers to him as Nicholas in the rest of her diary
That happened with a lot of people
They were clearly using real, live people as prototypes for some of their fantasy characters
We figured that Diello had a lot of qualities that they seemed to fear in Orson Welles
He seemed to represent some sort of dark, sexual force, so we figured that giving his features to the figure of Diello was appropriate
Could you talk about the fact that, during production, Anne Perry, the mystery writer, was "outed " as being Juliet Hulme
: Well, where do you start
We knew that would be a possible outcome of making this film-that someone might try and track down either Pauline or Juliet
Which was a very good reason not to make the movie
We had more compelling reasons to make the film, however, because if we didn't, anotherone was going to get made anyway
There were, at the time the film was being funded, five competing projects in various states of preparation
Didn't Dustin Hoffman have something in the works
: His company, Punch Productions,  believe, had a script written by an American writer; Peter had, in fact, been very tentatively approached to read it, that was how we found out about it
At that point we were about a week away from starting to shoot
And then someone was trying to do a film version of the play we've already spoken of, and other people were developing a very politicized lesbian version of the story
Then there'd been a screenplay written by the late English novelist, Angela Carter, that was with a production company in Auckland, and there was someone in Australia developing a screenplay
So we knew that this story was going to come to the screen, soon-there was no doubt someone was going to make it
And we felt that, in that climate, we would proceed, despite the possibility that these women might be exposed
We knew that in Pauline's case it was less likely
We'd heard a lot of rumor and gossip about Juliet, but we'd heard nothing about Pauline, and  think she has very carefully hidden her identity
Juliet went to no such trouble: she took her stepfather's name-Hilda Hulme ended up marrying Walter Perry-as a novelist, and proceeded to write a series of crime novels
You can look up any contemporary author index in any library, and there is Anne Perry, and her birthdate is the same as Juliet Hulme's, her mother's maiden name is the same, etc
There is a gap in her personal history, where she leaves out New Zealand, but it picks up again after she left the country
So it didn't take a huge amount of detective work from the journalist here in New Zealand who had heard that Anne Perry and JulietHulme were one and the same
That rumor sprang from a production of the play that had gone on here a year before we started shooting, where a friend of Juliet's, who was still writing to her, confided in one of the actors that Juliet Hulme was now writing murder mysteries as Anne Perry
That rumor hew around the acting community here in New Zealand, and it reached our ears on the set, and it was something that we wanted to entirely disassociate ourselves from, because we knew it would damage the film, and we knew it would damage us
It was inevitable that we would be accused of exploiting this woman's situation in order to promote the movie
When this journalist rang Peter and asked what comment he had about the story, he just begged her not to print it
Of course that was a hopeless situation, because she was a tabloid hack who was going to go ahead and make her name, and she has dined off it ever since
We felt an enormous amount of dread, because the movie hadn't had a chance to stand on its own before this was made known, and it's now been inextricably linked with this revelation
So we've been battling that ever since
But given that it's happened, we've had to deal with it, as she has
:  mean, we were absolutely disgusted by some of the ads Miramax ran
On the day that this was released in America,  rang Miramax and said, "For heaven's sake, don't associate this film with any of this because we don't approve of this publicity
" And a couple of months later, lo and behold, we get sent by a friend in the States clippings with these ads saying, "Murder, She Wrote," and these other references to Anne Perry that Miramax had been running, and we were just very, very angry
Did you fever consider using the coordinates of the actual event, but changing enough of the particulars to push it into the fictional realm
: No, because the case is so well-known in New Zealand; it would be like- : Fictionalizing the
Simpson case
: It's unnecessary
mean, sure, if it was just a movie for international consumption, then, yeah
But the fact is that we weren't actually making this film for an international audience
We were very much making it to try and rectify 40 years of misunderstanding about this case within New Zealand
In a way that was our main motivation for making the film, and in doing that, we obviously had to use their real names
But having said that, "Pauline Parker" and "Juliet Hulme" ceased to exist as people in 1959, because they both took different names
In a sense,  don't think there was any moral problem with using those names, because they themselves stopped using them some 30-odd years ago
Were there any other films you looked at as inspiration before writing this
: Well, we looked at movies like Let Him Have It, which was based on the Craig/Bentley murder case in England [Bentley was an 18-year-old with a low
who was hanged for murder]
Although  think that film has quite a lot of merit, in the end it comes across as a grim, dark, true-life murder story, and similarly Dance with a Stranger, which was about Ruth Ellis [the last woman to be hanged in England]
We felt that if there was one thing we didn't want to do, it was to make a depressing murder film
We really wanted to tell a tale of a friendship, rather than a murder story
Sure, the movie ends with a murder, but for the most part, it celebrates friendship
: We wanted to make it a lot funnier than those films
And people have said, "It's such a serious subject; why did you try to make it funny
" Well, obviously the murder wasn't funny, and we never attempted to make it funny, but the friendship was funny
Life is funny: generally, human beings like to enjoy themselves, and there was no doubt that Pauline and Juliet had a hell of a good time, most of the time
: But the other reason why it was important that we tell this as a true story is that it has a kind of universal truth for anybody growing up
When you're at that age, you become very focused on things in an extreme way
And  don't think Pauline and Juliet are so very different from anybody else;  think several things went wrong in their lives-Juliet's parents broke up, and Pauline became very alienated from her family (she was an obsessional manic-depressive character)-and  think it was this terriblecombination of things that led to this extraordinarily horrible act
But it's not something that can be precluded from anybody's experience in growing up
Adolescence is such a crazy time
:  lot of women have come up to us and said, " was Pauline
That was me
That was my childhood
"  don't think it's that unusual
think what is unusual about the whole thing is that these aspects of Pauline's character led to the murder, and  don't think the sort of person she was was particularly unusual or freakish or weird
When we hear things like that, it's the best possible endorsement we could get
