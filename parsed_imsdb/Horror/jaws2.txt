" 2" Final Draft Screenplay by Carl Gottlieb Based on a Story by Howard Sackler : - Dramatically lit by sunlight filtering down from the surface
dim shape, massive, threatening, swims towards us from the distance
Then it divides -- what was one is two, and the shape becomes reality; two divers in Scuba gear swimming side by side
They are wearing minimal rubber, considering the cool New England waters: "Farmer John" wetsuits with cut- off legs, assorted sport-diving paraphernalia, including an expensive camera with a flash attachment
One motions "Down there," the other signals ",  see it," and they dive deeper, into darker waters, where the shafts of sunlight pour into the depths, broken up by seaweed and floating vegetation into cathedral-like columns of illumination
- The wreck of the working fisherman's boat "," formerly under the command of the late Captain Quint, deceased these four years
Buried in the sand near it, still connected by rusting strands of cable, the mangled remains of a shark cage, glimmering with stainless steel highlights
fitful flash of yellow from under a mossy beard -- a battered barrel, similarly tangled
The divers, Bert and Ernie, appear
They're fascinated by the find, and Bert, with the camera, snaps a few flash shots
The rapid sequence of flashes signals the presence of a motor drive camera
Distant flashes, obscured by vegetation in the foreground
, Ernie is exploring the abandoned cabin; doors open and shut, moved by invisible currents stirred by his passage
An occasional "Flash
" lights up the bottom as Bert continues snapping away souvenir shots of this local landmark
'    -   () Ernie floats up out of a hatch, sees the camera, and strikes a pose, clowning for the photographer's benefit
big hand, f
g
, motions him up into clear water for a formal portrait
He obliges
Now he floats in front of us, gently paddling his flippers to maintain vertical stability
One flash
Another
Then a large, dim movement in the b
g
Something's out there, moving towards us
Flash
It's bigger, bearing down like a train in a tunnel
Flash
It's on us
Flash
Teeth
Blood
Flash
Blackness, Death
, The camera floats gently down and settles in the sand dark red mist eddies by
last weak flash
: - Flash
An expensive cabin cruiser, the "Diver Working" flag fluttering limply in the breeze, is riding alone at anchor
Flash
distant lighthouse beacon winks at us
The boat rocks in the ceaseless swell
On the stern, "Elizabeth
- Newport,
"  long way from home
: - blue-and-white police jeep is bouncing over the sand figure in civilian clothes driving alone on some urgent mission
It's Martin Brody, Chief of Police on Amity
The jeep slows to a stop, and he takes a flight of stairs leading to a concrete patio two at a time
classical trumpet solo is playing in the background
Brody charges through a door, then abruptly slows and starts moving warily through a hotel interior: The Holidome, a three-story extravaganza of a motel, where some sort of formal ceremony is already in progress
banner announces: "Grand Opening Ball -- Amity Scholarship Fund Benefit
" Brody crosses under a High School band, arranged dance-band style on a balcony; the trumpet player, Polo, is finishing his solo, the assembled crowd applauds politely
Brody is taking his place with some dignitaries on the dais, as the presiding authority, Amity Mayor Larry Vaughn, begins speaking
Thank you, Paul Lohman, for that eloquent solo
Now, for that point in the ceremonies where we formally dedicate this magnificent resort- hotel complex, a worthwhile addition to the recreational paradise we call Amity
Seated on folding chairs, wearing their good suits, several of Amity's Selectmen, Real Estate Developer Len Peterson, and Ellen Brody, very chic
Brody slips into the vacant chair next to her
The following is conducted in urgent whispers, sotto voce, while Vaughn drones on
Where the hell were you
Late
can see that
Don't you know this is a big deal
Couldn't help it
Hendricks over there
(he indicates his deputy) still has the keys to the jeep in his pocket, and  couldn't find the spares
Terrific
Act as if you've been here all along
How'm  supposed to do that
Look bored
(droning along) Holiday Inn joins the Amity Shores development condominium complex in a welcome expression renewed interest in Amity Island as the hub of the Northeast Recreational Vacation Wonderland
We're happy once again to be in the center of things, where the action is
We've had our share of hard times and long winters and the past few years have not been easy
But today, the sun is rising on a new Amity, a new island filled with promise
(applause) Len Peterson's Amity Shores Development is an exciting addition to our island
The Holiday Inn we stand in is likewise a new friend who we welcome as family
Amity means 'friendship' and our community extends its friendship to all who seek her shores in peace and harmony
(applause) Brody settles into polite attentiveness, acknowledging a wave from Hendricks, a politely bland young town cop in his idea of civilian finery
Hendricks is fussing with the banner on an attractive young lady in a bathing suit
And now, Tina Wilcox, this year's Miss Amity, will cut the ribbon that officially opens this luxurious new hotel
Tina (the girl in the bathing suit) escapes Hendricks' attentions, and teeters on high heels towards the ribbon, while Phil Fogarty, the local photographer, snaps away
Tina was selected from more than 20 of this island's lovely young ladies in the Miss Amity competition held every spring, and she'll represent Amity Island in the Miss Massachusetts Competition in Worcester next month
When she cuts this ribbon, she will be opening our island to growth, to development, to planned expansion with full employment for our thriving community
Paul Lohman ("Polo" to his friends) is exchanging whispers with Lucy, a flute player nearby
don't think she's such hot stuff
When are we going out
You and me
Not tonight
You going with Patrick
Lucy nods, Polo shrugs, and turns to Jane, a girl nearby
Listen, Jane -- you want to dance as soon as we get out of these monkey suits
She nods happily, they whisper together, while we: : Martin and Ellen have been joined by their youngest son, Sean
Mom, Michael won't talk to me
(to Ellen) Shouldn't he be at home
Mrs
Silvera couldn't come
This money tree, you may have noticed, is made entirely of twenty-dollar bills, donated by Len Peterson, the builder of Amity Shores Condominiums, as a gesture of goodwill towards the community
$500 as a special gift to the Amity township scholarship fund
Applause from the crowd, Len takes a bow
(prompting) Go ahead, Tina
as she reaches out with the scissors
Something catches her eye, and she winks at her boyfriend, Ed Marchand, smirking in the crowd
He winks back, and makes "Cut it" motions with his fingers
Tina cuts the ribbon, and Tom Andrews, a local diver, pushes a decorated float out into the pool; sparklers sputter, balloons drop from the ceiling
Thanks to Tom Andrews, of Amity Aqua- Sports, for contributing the special decorations
And now, the Amity High School band
Refreshments on the patio, everyone
The band swings into "Downtown," and the crowd gets up to dance, to eat, and to break into small groups to talk
: - Ellen is dragging Brody over to where Len Peterson and Larry Vaughn, the mayor, are in conversation
They pass vignettes: Tina and Ed, Tom Andrews and Jane, Marge, other interesting Amity townspeople
(seeing Peterson and Vaughn) Do  have to talk to those two
My boss and your boss
Sure
Hello, hello
It went well,  thought
Very impressive ceremony
Good speech
Thank you, thank you
You know my son, don't you
He beckons over their heads to Larry Vaughn, Jr
, a young man uncomfortable in his correct tie and blazer
They exchange perfunctory greetings
The speech was right on the money
(to Ellen) Be a love and make sure the bar's open, will you
He puts his arm around her, a little too familiarly for Brody's liking
(to Brody) Fantastic lady
Don't know what 'd do without her
Me neither
(looking around) 'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town
All of us thank you, okay
Watch Sean for a minute
And she hands Sean off to Brody, leaving him with an over- active 10 year old, while she's gone
Can  go swimming
No
Find your brother, okay
Sean nods and runs off, happy to have a mission
: - He is talking to Brooke Peters, a mop-maned teen-ager with a pleasant face
Timmy Weldon, a grade behind, lurks nearby
plumpish, curly- haired buddy, Andy Nicholas, is enjoying a cup of punch
How old is your cousin
Seventeen
She's a senior
'm not crazy about blind dates
They're okay, if they got little white canes and tin cups
That's awful
What the hell
(to Mike) Did your mom put all this together
Yeah, it's her job
Is she responsible for the punch
No
Good
It's terrible
My cousin will be here tomorrow
Great
Sean finds them, and bursts into their group
Michael, Michael, Dad said to find you
Okay, you did that
Come on, Mikey, come on
He tugs at Mike's sleeve; Mike allows himself to be dragged off
Okay, okay
Got to go
Andy and Brooke are left standing together, Tim moves in
(to Brooke) Want to dance
(she shakes her head "no") Okay
Later
On her shrug, as she turns to Andy: : /
/ - It's later; night has fallen, the band is playing its version of "When  Fall in Love
" Many teen-agers are dancing out on the patio, some adults are dancing inside, the buffet is ravaged, Timmy is watching Brooke, who's dancing with Polo
Douglas Fetterman ("Doug") joins him, after asking Marge for a dance and striking out
Get a dance yet
Nope
Me neither
Who'd you ask
Tina Wilcox
You're crazy
She's Ed's girl friend
Doesn't hurt to ask
Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest
That's a crock of shit
know
Bob Burnside, a tall pal of Larry Vaughn Jr
's, turns up by their side
Same tired old faces
You see Vaughn
The mayor
Larry Vaughn Junior
(Doug shrugs) If you see him, tell him  got a six- pack, a blanket, and the Brebner twins
He exits, on the prowl
No class
None at all
(pause) wonder what the Brebner twins are doing tomorrow night
Can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man
Why
Because they're playing our song
And sure enough, they are -- the band has turned to a Fifties slow-dance standard: " Wish You Love
" Peterson approaches
May  have this dance
Sorry, 'm all booked up
(taking Ellen) Come, m'dear
They slowly fox trot out onto the terrace
Both of them nodding greetings to townspeople and kids -- everyone knows the chief
Remember 1959, the Jersey shore
And how
thought you wouldn't respect me
did,  did
The music and the summer moon are working their magic
Listen -- what are you doing later
Fooling around
Right
He dips with her; they look up and notice Sean, sound asleep on a bench
Let's get the kid home
Home it is
He crosses to the sleepy Sean and hoists him with a grunt
(to the kid) You're getting a little big for this
Sean murmurs sleepily and hugs his dad
Mike, dancing with Marge, waves good-bye
The Brodys start to leave, passing a bucket with a bottle of champagne still in it
They exchange a look, nod agreement, and Brody boosts the bottle, sneaking it out of the building while Ellen giggles
: - Brody and Ellen are snuggling under the covers while early morning light streams under the blinds
It's The Morning After, and the clothes from the night before are scattered all over the room
Brody rolls against Ellen, spoon-fashion, morning-horny
Mmmm
MMMmmmorning
They start to move a little, then turn face to face
Outside their door, the sounds of little feet; Sean padding downstairs
Sean's awake
Door's locked
(kissing) Good
Their bodies move under the blankets
There's a crash from the kitchen
They stop for a beat
As they resume, little feet return
' The milk fell out of the 'frigerator
(whispering) Put a towel down
And shh -- daddy's sleeping
' Okay
His feet paddle off
Brody and Ellen start to slide together, passion resumes
'mere
Bigger feet go downstairs; Michael's up
The Brodys kiss, trying to ignore the sounds of spirited discussion between brothers over who's responsible for spilled milk
Then the sound of a car pulling into the driveway, and a horn beep
Mrs
Silvera
Mrs
Silvera
They try to kiss again, there's a door slam downstairs, and talk between the boys and Mrs
Silvera
The Brodys look at each other and break up laughing at the morning, and themselves
As Ellen and Brody, with the practice of 18 years of marriage, swing back-to-back, and put their feet on the floor, each on their side of the bed, still chuckling, up for the day
Need a ride
As far as the office
: The police jeep is driving through the picturesque streets, Brody behind the wheel, Ellen and Sean passengers
It slows near the foot of the street, dockside, where a real estate office marked "Amity Shores Development, Leonard Peterson, Pres
" sits
Peterson's big Cadillac is parked illegally at the curb
It has the Amity Shores logo on its side
Some people
What's daddy doing
Writing a ticket
Brody is out of the car, his pad in his hand
Hey
That's my boss
Better yet
Peterson, in shirt-sleeves and a tie, hustles out of the office Wait a minute
Too late, it's written
Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer
(to Ellen) Don't you have any pull with the chief, here
Do  have to
(taking the ticket) Better get a sales kit together for after lunch
'm taking some prospects out
Ellen kisses Brody, and starts in for her day's work
See you later
(to Brody) Can't we fix it up to get this made into a green zone or something
Len, pay the two dollars
Peterson shrugs and goes inside his office
Brody's attention is drawn by some noise by the dock
,  - Hendricks and an old codger, Red, are working on Amity's newest bit of police equipment; a blue power launch for patrolling local waters
The boat is Hendricks' personal pride and joy
(to Red) Tie it off on your left
Your other left
As Red complies, Hendricks spots his boss
Good morning
(walking onto the dock, Sean tagging along) Aren't you off-duty
Till noon
This is on my own time
(to Sean) Hi, Shorty
'm not short
'm eleven
There's a hoot from a passing boat horn
Sean waves happily
It has slowed to a halt in front of the police berth; it's a scruffy working fisherman, back from the banks with a full load
The Skipper hails Brody
Yo
Chief
What
You got a gold-plater drifting in the main channel
Big cruiser
Whereabouts
Off the Point
No running lights, just a diver's flag
(aside to Brody) Want me to run out there
On your own time
Happy to do it
Then check it out
'll be in the office
Hendricks nods, and starts the engine importantly
Cast off your bow line
And your stern line
Spring line
While Red grumbles, Brody and Sean are walking up to the street
Michael and some teen-agers are headed down to the dock
It's Mike, Polo, Patrick, Lucy, Brooke, Ed and Tina
Where to
No place special
Just hanging out
Sailing
Mike nods
Watch your kid brother, huh
He gets into his jeep, leaving Sean with the teen-agers
Bye, Mr
Brody
The others ad lib appropriate greetings/good-byes, as Brody drives off in his jeep
- The Kids busy themselves with their boats while Sean hovers around Mike, who's not happy at baby-sitting his kid brother
Anyone want to sail to the lighthouse
Machs nix to me
Anyone got a spare mooring line
Mine's shot
've got one
Can  go too
No
Please
said, 'No
' Tina's in her boat, "Tina's Joy," a neat sloop
Mike is going over his "Green Machine," a sleek catamaran
You're not going out right away, are you
Waiting for Andy
want you to meet my cousin
will,  will
want to go out with you
You need a crew, don't you
Before Sean can protest further, Mike spots his crew: Andy Nicholas, a round-faced, frizzy-haired pal, wearing a bathing suit, and carrying some scuba gear from an early-morning diving class
Marge and Denise, two other divers, are with him, with their gear
They ad-lib "good-byes
" don't need you
Andy's here
You always go with Andy
(to Andy) How was dive class
Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble- bubble, stroke-stroke
There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean
Shells and lobsters and stuff
Mostly old garbage
Today we found a '48 Hudson
Do  have to play with the little kids
Yeah
Go on, beat it
Sean mopes away while Andy and Mike get their boat ready for sea
Up on the street, where a pretty girl with a sexy face and a provocative post-pubescent walk is asking him directions
He points down at the dock
The Girl, Jackie Peters, waves at her cousin, Brooke
Brooke
Hey
One of the boats has a portable radio going
It's playing some medium-hot salsa
Jackie does a couple of dance steps on her way down the dock
Who's that
Quick -- 'm in love
hope that's the cousin
Over here
want you to meet somebody
Lucky
Lucky, lucky, lucky
As the four teen-agers come together in a tight quartet, the music rocks up and we: : - Later in the day, sailboats with bright colored sails and ornately painted hulls tack back and forth
Lots of chatter between boats, horseplay, splashing, and general good times
It's cruising, on water
,  '  - with Mike, Andy, Jackie and Brooke
How fast does this go
With the right wind, 15-20 knots
What
Real fast
He sheets in, heeling the boat over in the stiff breeze
Far out
Jackie screams in excitement; for a city girl, this is more fun than a roller coaster
, "" overtaking Mike's boat
It's piloted by Larry Vaughn, Jr
, the Mayor's Son; with him is his good friend, Bob Burnside
Coming up
Gangway, Turkies
It's immediately a race between the red boat -- "Sizzler," and Mike's "Green Machine
" The Kids ad-lib -- "Faster," "Lookout," "Gybe, gybe
" We're carrying weight
We'll take your supercargo
Is that me
That's you
've never been supercargo
Donny and Denise's boat cuts in, stealing the Sizzler's air
Hey, get out of our air
Want a passenger
Denise hops nimbly from one boat to the other as Danny sails tight as a tick to the red cat
Way to go
: The sailboats cutting up, cruising the harbor, the local teen-agers partying with each other: --  Patrick and Lucy's Sol Cat, flying its hull
--  Susie's Laser heeled 'way over' in a stiff breeze
--  Polo and a pretty girl in his sloop, "Sea Witch
" --  Timmy Weldon and Doug Fetterman playing catch-up in their respective boats, the Doughdish and the Inflatable
--  Marge in her Lightening, sailing close to Ed and Tina in Tina's Joy
: - Silent, green-blue depths
diver, Crosby, working the bottom, running a search pattern
Another diver, Tom Andrews, running close
They signal to each other, and make another pass
Follow Tom Andrews as he skims the bottom, near the wreck of the Orca, half-buried in the silt
diver's line runs up and , : - Bobbing on the surface are three boats: the Amity Police launch, the deserted Elizabeth
, from Newport, flying a diver's flag, and the ScubaVue, a local diveboat operated by Tom Andrews and his partner, Crosby; it has "Amity Aqua Sports" lettered on it somewhere
Hendricks and Red are on the deck of the police boat, peering at the cruiser
Rich or poor, it's nice to have money
Figure they split
Happens every season -- someone takes off
Once we had a schooner for a month while the owners went fox hunting
sudden eruption in the water nearby startles them -- it's Andrews, surfacing, holding up the underwater flash camera
This is all there is
Crosby pops up next to him, shows empty hands
If that's it, that's it
The divers head for their boat, Hendricks fires up his engine, and we: : '  - Brody is trying to reason with an indignant fat man
can't watch the news,  can't watch a ball game,  can't watch movies -- all  hear is that rotten kid with his rotten radio
"Breaker, Breaker
" 'll do what  can, but you're talking about a federal jurisdiction
(leaving in a huff) So call the
Black, two sugars
Thanks
What else is out there
One petty theft, one domestic disturbance, and an exhibitionist
'll take the exhibitionist, you handle the others
Chief Brody
want you to do something about my first husband
Brody is caught in the open
- Martin, you have got to demand that Grace Kinney keep her shades down
2ND What about enforcing the "No Parking" ordinance on Beach Road
In a minute, in a minute -- talk to Mrs
Prendergast, please
(continuing) Albert keeps coming around when 'm with gentlemen friends and he throws mud on their cars
2ND (eager to be heard) Every time there's an out- of-state car in my driveway, lose another mailbox
Those little iron sailboats cost thirty-two dollars each
(to White Haired Man) Talk to me about Mrs
Kinney
- Her bedroom window faces my oldest boy's bedroom, and she's teasing him, dancing around in a towel, or less
Dancing
Hendricks has entered, carrying the camera brought up from the bottom by the divers
Chief
Hendricks
want to go over your reports and your Form 908
They go into Brody's inner office; the uproar continues behind the door, but it's calm in here
never heard of a 908
just made it up
It means, "Get me out of there
" (notices the camera) What the hell's that
Diver's camera
Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser
Abandoned
It's a little early in the season for that
Rich people
Home port is Newport, Rhode Island
If  had a $100,000 boat,  sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel
If you had a $100,000 boat there'd be an investigation
Hendricks puts the camera in an informal "Lost & Found" box sitting in the office
Brody makes the mistake of opening the door, revealing the White-Haired Man
- Grace Kinney is driving my boy to distraction
Hendricks, get a description of that dance
(to Brody) Chief Brody
want to talk to you about my daughter
she's 15, but mature for her age
Chief, 've been telling Mrs
Prendergast that it's no good just talking about Albert, she's got to do something
2ND Look -- the township is responsible for protecting life and property, and my property is unprotected
As Brody turns to deal with the mess, we: : Looking up at the surface, where a hull floats in silhouette against the daylight
There's a commotion, and a water ski drops into view
Then another one
Pale legs churn the water
: - Off Amity Beach, a bilious green lap-straked boat is bobbing in the water, the engine idling
Two girls are fooling around; the one in the water is Terry, the one driving the boat is Diane
Did you ever see a dolphin
Sure
They like to play
We may see some today
Great
She fumbles with her skis
Whoops, almost lost one
Can't play with the dolphins without skis
Ready
Hang on, hang on
Okay, go
Diane goes to the controls, and puts the engine into gear, starting forward
Terry waves "okay," Diane opens up the throttle, the boat surges forward, pulling Terry upright
wake boils out from under her skis
Ed and Tina are camped on a blanket, necking in the shelter of the dunes
There's a portable radio, a cooler with some beer, and some sandwiches -- a perfect afternoon alone
Above the dune, behind them lies the ocean, where the girls' ski boat can be seen, raising a big wake
Tina disengages, and sits up, brushing sand out of her hair
Take a break for a minute, okay
Huh
Tina stands, and looks out to the sea, where the boat is towing Terry on the water
Eddie, can we do that
(no reaction) Can we go skiing
We can use my Uncle's boat
Eddie
Next week
With you, everything's next week want to go skiing soon
Tomorrow
Ed grunts non-comittally
Tina takes a beer from the cooler, and goes up on the dune to watch Terry and Diane
She waves to them, and to someone down the beach
- An old lady, Grace Witherspoon, is rocking on her porch, also enjoying the view of young people enjoying themselves
She acknowledges Tina's distant wave, and turns her attention back to the skiers
having a wonderful time
Terry is good, criss-crossing the wake, showing off
rushing through the water, waving, stunting
Faster
Faster
She waves at Diane, who leans over the controls, to coax more speed out of the old engine
following the skis effortlessly, closing in on the turbulent wake
Terry whipping along; a fin raises near her
She glances at it, waves, thinking it's a porpoise
Porpoise
Look
dolphin
The fin slides low in the water, heading towards her
She puts the rope around her waist, leaving both hands free
Closing in on the wake, crossing it
- The fin cuts across her path
Too late to maneuver, Terry hits the looming gray back of the Shark
The skis bump, leave the water, Terry takes a spectacular spill
The rope around her waist tows her helpless through the water, gagging her, preventing her from shouting
She flounders as Diane slows the boat to see what's happened
turning back to see if her friend hit a submerged log or hurt herself
Terry
You okay
Help
Help
Okay, okay, coming
She still doesn't realize the gravity of the situation -- she hasn't seen the fin
hysterical, pulling herself hand-over-hand up the rope, trying to get to the boat
Closing in on the thrashing figure
Screaming, as the Shark rises from the deep and takes her
Suddenly she's gone, a swirl of pink froth marking the water where she went under
- Looking around for her friend, suddenly panicky
She pulls the rope hard, and tumbles backward as it comes up with nothing on it -- just a cleanly bitten end
(screaming) Terry
Then the Shark appears, blood on its mouth, lunging up and butting the stern, jarring the engine loose
Fuel spills from a ruptured line
Help
God, help
She throws things at the Shark, which slides back under the water
- Diane can be seen flailing in the boat, very distant screams floating across the water; at this range they sound like the normal shrieks of teen-age girls having fun
- as the Shark hits from a fresh angle, this time taking a chunk out of the boat, biting down with powerful jaws
Diane hurls seat-cushions, oars, anything she can lay hands on
She fumbles desperately in a compartment, produces a flare pistol
She cocks it and fires point-blank at the shark
The flare hits, wet fuel glistening on the water and skin of the Shark explodes in a sheet of flame
last flash before the gasoline explodes
No-o-o-o-o-o
sheet of fire, she's in the middle, screaming, aflame, the Shark forgotten
She falls into the water as the ruined boat overturns and there's an oily explosion
-  - Ed and Tina look up as they hear the distant "crump" of the boat blowing up
- Mrs
Witherspoon looks up, startled by the sudden tragedy
She gets up to go to the phone, indoors, and we: : -  - The launch is anchored at the site of the explosion, offshore
Red is fishing up bits of flotsam with a boathook
Hendricks is on the radio, talking to the shore
can't find anyone out here
They must've gone to the bottom, or drifted with the current
He's on the porch of tile Witherspoon house, using his portable walkie-talkie
Mrs
Witherspoon is waiting in the b
g
Nearby, we can see a sign: " : Call New England Light and Power Before Digging
" The cable itself surfaces in a chain-link fenced enclosure, and climbs a power pole for distribution to the island
Ed and Tina are also there, having given statements
There should be bodies
Witnesses say two people; one in the boat, one skiing
(
) (filtered) told you -- nothing here
Try dragging
(
) For how long
Current's moving everything around, and it's getting dark
Stay on it
don't care how long it takes
(
) 10-4
Brody turns to Ed and Tina, and takes out his notebook
We heard this noise, like a 'boomp' out there, and when we looked, there was just this cloud of smoke
That was the explosion
One minute they were having a wonderful time, the next, bang
don't know what could've done that
Brody stares out at the quiet sea -- what's lurking under that calm surface
Can we go now
Brody's still looking past them, towards the ocean
Chief Brody -- can we go
Please
Oh, yeah
Sure
As he gazes at the ocean, we hear the sound of a distant siren, and : - An ambulance, siren wailing and red light flashing, drives on its melancholy way through the picturesque town
: - Hendricks has the winch in operation, the cable in his hand, with big grappling hooks attached
The boat is lit by its powerful worklights
Hendricks heaves them out, watches as the current takes them, then puts the winch in gear, hauling back
How much longer
Until we find something
don't care about the overtime, 'm hungry
And cold
And most of all, bored
- It goes taut with a sudden strain
He sees it, too
think we got something
Red moves to the winch, watching warily as it slows to a near stall with the weight
About damn time
What the hell is it
There's a strain on the cable -- it's pulling the stern of the boat down as it struggles with the weight
Here it comes
lit by the harsh worklights on the deck of the launch
The cable from the winch is taut, pulling something up from the black depths
What
The coupling appears, then the hook, and an oily cable
Oh shit
Drop it
What is it
Power line
Oh, great
He hits the release on the winch, and the cable whines as it spins out and settles back on the bottom
Red jiggles the line, trying to free it up
It comes here from Cable Junction
Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island
(at the winch) Now you're talking
Let's get out of here before we do find something
: - The next morning, the Brody family is downstairs, each getting his own special breakfast
Mike gets cereal for himself and Sean, Ellen is cracking some soft-boiled eggs, Brody is drinking coffee and smoking
You have to smoke so early in the morning
It's good with coffee
So's a donut
want Fruit Loops
Eat Cheerios
You eat Cheerios
want Fruit Loops
Eat Cheerios
What're you guys doing today
(indicates Sean) don't know about him -- 'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing
Every day
What else is there to do
You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school
Do  have to
You'll have to make up your own mind about that
Where's my day book
In the den
Ellen passes them on the way to the den to look for it
He doesn't have to work all the time, it's his vacation
Mrs
Silvera enters from the service porch
Good morning -- everyone up early today
There's a lot going on
He follows Ellen into the den
- Ellen is rummaging around the papers on the end table, looking for her book
Why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up
Because, 'm in the middle of a boating accident,  got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat
He's another one
One what
(she finds the book) Ah-ha
Boat nut
What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating
It's an island
(she pecks him on the cheek) Got to run
She heads out the door for the office
Mike approaches
'm going
What about tennis
Riding
Fixing up old cars
Bartending
Bartending
'm 17
Okay, not bartending
Why on the water every day
Because
Look, humor the old man -- just be careful
(going) 'll be careful
'll see y'later
Mike passes through on his way out, nodding to Mrs
Silvera who acknowledges his passage
Brody is close on his heels
Don't go out if it's rough or anything, huh
We've had a lot of trouble
Okay, okay
The back door slams behind him
Can  go with you today
You stay with Mrs
Silvera, Tootsie
Okay
Sean nods, resigning himself to the inevitable
(to Sean) You can come with me to the market
All right
'll be at the office
Mrs
Silvera nods, and pours Sean a glass of milk
Brody sighs, and heads out the door
Sean calls after him
Bye, Daddy
'm going to be careful, all day
: - Sitting snug and ship-shape on Mike's Green Machine are Mike, Andy, Brooke, and Jackie
They are heeled over in a brisk wind, making good headway; sailing nearby in the b
g
are Patrick and Lucy and Donny and Denise, in their boats
(from her boat) Where're we going
Oh, out a ways
Maybe the lighthouse
The lighthouse
No big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic
We got some stuff at the store
Ed and Tina are going to be there
Oh, sure, they would be
What's the lighthouse
It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse
We sometimes hang out there, you know
Great
got some wine
She opens her big floppy bag, revealing the top half of a jug of Mountain Red
Brooke slides over to her
(aside) The lighthouse is a make-out spot
Now  really want to see it
You going to fool around with Mike
(Jackie shrugs) Well, 'm not doing anything with him
She indicates Andy, who pretends great indifference
Well, maybe  will, then
Andy does about a triple take before he regains his cool
Mike concentrates on his sailing, Jackie grins an impish, vixen grin, Brooke shrugs
: - spectacular view from the top of the old lighthouse, showing ocean, sandy beach, some of the Kids' catamarans pulled up on the sand, other pleasure boats cruising in the b
g
Ed and Tina are running down the stairs, laughing
Come on back up here
Nope
Give me back my hat
Double nope
where Andy, Mike, Jackie, and Brooke are camped around a blanket listening to a portable radio
Ed and Tina run by
Why'd they decide to move
Too hot in the lighthouse
Too hot for those two
can't believe it
Is there something  don't know about
told you, remember
Oh, yeah
So why aren't they doing it now
There's a little round of giggling
Maybe by now they are
They're moving pretty fast
He's cute
& running towards a dune and over it
in f
g
, covered with birds
Ed and Tina appear over the crest of a dune, and the frame explodes in a flurry of seagulls, suddenly disturbed
The whir and drumbeat of wings, and the shrieking of the gulls is a jarring shock
- reacting
Yech
The huge hulk of a beached, decomposing dead whale, a few birds still pecking at scraps of blubber and entrails
Big festering red holes mark its sides
: - From the top of the lighthouse, we can see a group of interested spectators, clustered around the whale like ants at a picnic
few more boats are beached and riding at anchor just off the shore, including the Amity police boat
Three Ants are walking towards the crowd, one of them gesturing
: , She's Lureen Elkins, a marine biologist from the Oceanographic Institute, and she's skeptical
Brody is the ant whose antennae were waving in the long shot
As soon as  heard about it,  called you
This thing is big
His arms indicate big
After we've looked, we'll talk
This is it
He moves forward to clear the crowd
Some kids are poking the massive hulk with sticks
tourist couple is snapping away with a Polaroid -70
The whole mess stinks, too
Move back, please
back off
open it up a little
The crowd edges back, giving way to Brody and Elkins
See
What'd  tell you
Brody is holding a handkerchief to his nose as he approaches the dead thing, indicating a huge open wound on the side
Look at that
First things first
She produces a tape measure and gives one end to Brody
From the tip of the snout, please
Elkins is measuring the length of the creature
She calls off numbers to Hendricks, who is officiously writing it all down, repeating numbers as he hears them
Length, 22 feet, 8 inches
Come on, let's check the bite radius
(cold) The what
Bite radius
You know, the size of the mouth
The whale's mouth
The Shark's mouth
What shark
Brody pitches his voice low, so that the crowd won't listen
The shark that did this
It was a shark, wasn't it
We don't know that, do we
But that's what we're here to find out, right
You don't tell me my job, and  won't tell you about yours, okay
can't hear you if you're going to whisper
Can we go now
He turns to join the kids as they slip through the crowd to return to their blanket, ad-libbing good-byes
(to Mike) You stay here a minute
Oh, c'mon
You heard me
We'll be over by the lighthouse
'll be right there
Wait up
They hang around, waiting for him
Elkins has reclaimed Brody's attention
Could be a shark
But maybe not
Look,  know a little bit about sharks
Do you
know that this was probably a Great White Shark
Car-cadon
Caradan
He fumbles for the correct Latin
(helping out) Carcharadon Carcharias
That's it
Okay, so that's it
Is there one in these waters
What makes you think there might be
Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish
This is a mammal, not a fish
Jesus, don't quibble with me
want to know if a Great White Shark did this
Probably
That's it
Probably
Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around
And sound
(this is a new one) Sound
Sound
Like sonar, or radar
They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low-frequency vibration
So there's one around here
Not necessarily
These wounds could've been inflicted 30 miles out to sea, or more
None of them are immediately fatal
Currents could've carried the body 10 miles further
(chiming in) We got a helluva tide this month
Could you just keep that crowd back, please
(fidgeting) Pop
You stay right here
You're going in with me
As Elkins examines the whale, calling her observations to Hendricks
We came out in my boat
Andy can sail in it
got a date
She'll understand
She won't
Lower jaw displaced and lacerated by predator attempt to seize the tongue
Additional large tissue loss in the dorsal and sub- dorsal areas, as well as the caudal
Oriamal bite radius 37 inches, allowing for salt-water erosion and subsequent small predator and scavenger tissue attacks
The Kids have moved a little closer to hear what's going on between father and son
don't want to discuss it
Elkins crosses to Brody
It's either a Great White, or another killer whale
Can't you tell
Not when it's like this
This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least
Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite
Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate
Send out signals, or something
You know, take revenge, sense an enemy
Don't be ridiculous -- Sharks don't take things personally
Dad, please
Brody turns on him
This at least, is something he can do something about
No more sailing
You come back with me, and that's it
Why me
Because  say so
'll tie up at the town dock, don't worry, man
See you later, Mikey
Later, bye
(ad lib) : - Vaughn and Brody enter, walking through the spare, empty town meeting hall, towards the conference table
They are alone
'm showing summer rentals
We got a helluva season going
We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone
We're alone
Larry,  don't know how to say this, but  think we got a shark problem
real one
Vaughn stares at him, then unlocks the door to his private office -- "Mayor" -- and leads Brody in
'  - Small, expensively furnished in antiques, with a few symbols of Amity boosterism cluttering one wall: a photo of the beach, featuring a shark tower; an architect's rendering of the new Holiday Inn, some charts and graphs showing upward progress, a few stills of businessmen's luncheons, plaques, awards, etc
Are you serious
Of course
Look -- 've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing
Be realistic
got a feeling
have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you
Of course  can, but can't it wait
These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money
We have to do something
We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know
know,  know
And  stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches
In New England
We all lost on that one
It's still a good idea
Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have everything you want; right now, the town's broke
Please, Larry -- there's good reason
Those water skiers
(interrupting) tragedy
But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident
Two of them are still missing
There's always deaths in these waters that never turn up
Are they all shark victims
Maybe they are
Brody's overstated his case, and he realizes it
Bullshit
(shouting) Bullshit
'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it
(shouting back) What am , an ass
When you called me,  called Elkins, and her bosses
Nothing she saw is proof of anything
Someone has to do something
(back in control) Don't push it this time
If you do, it won't turn out the way you want, guarantee you that
The two men study each other for a long moment
Then, 've got to get back to work
He holds the door for Brody, who walks out as Vaughn lags behind, locking up his sanctum
: -  () Brody is alone in the jeep, headed for the safety of home and family
He drives past the town's billboard: it's covered with an architect's rendering of the Amity Holiday Inn
The sign reads: "  ,
" Plastered across it is an added streamer: "
" Barely visible underneath are older notices: " ," and "
" As Brody passes the sign, he impulsively swings off the main road and heads down towards the beach
- Brody is on restless patrol, checking the water's edge as he continues on home
As he drives along, he sees: a clambake; some teen-agers in a group, necking and dancing; and a few solitary surfcasters and fishermen
The beach is deserted, the sun is setting, and Brody and his jeep have the sand to themselves
It's then that he sees something: ' big bow section of a ruined, burnt boat is bobbing in the surf just off the beach ahead
It's a piece of the waterskiers' boat; Brody heads towards it
As Brody slows his jeep just short of the water, and gets out to look at the flotsam
His shoes get wet
He backs up onto dry sand, then tries to edge closer to examine this object
It bobs up and down in the surf; Brody makes "Get in here" motions
The junk resists
Come on, give a guy a break
No response
He takes off his shoes and socks, and rolls up his trouser legs
silly sight
He wades into the water after it
Come on
Here boy
Come to Poppa
It eludes him, and he flounders after it
big wave breaks across his crotch
Hoo
Cold
He's almost there, it's just beyond his reach, he's got it, he's lost it, he has it again, it's slippery
(ad lib) Come here
Come on, Sweetheart
You bastard
little closer
Here y'go
Then, he's got it --- (exultant) Gotcha
As he grabs the ruined wood, and pulls it towards him
Suddenly, the mass of wreckage breaks apart, and something lunges out of the mess and into Brody
- " " Brody is suddenly pinned under a soggy charred horror; the gory remains of Diane, burnt beyond recognition,: flesh peeled away, discolored, charred, ruined by days in salt water
He screams, and scrabbles in the wet sand, trying to get out of the dreadful clutches of the half-human thing he's dredged from the water
Extricating himself, puking, retching, splashing water on his face, washing his hands frantically, just behind him, The Thing lying on the sand, a gruesome joke played by the sea
: '  -  -   - Macro close on a pharmaceutical bottle of Sodium Cyanide, from which a syringe is withdrawing a healthy dose
Follow the syringe and reveal Brody, working at his desk in the deserted office
He is injecting the deadly chemical into some jacketed
38 hollow-point ammunition; a dozen cartridges are lined up in neat array, he is filling the last of them, sealing the points with wax from a burning red candle
The radio scanner is monitoring the local police band: routine reports faintly in the b
g
-- a slow night in pre-season Amity
As a sound at the door makes him look up
He hides the odd gear as Hendricks enters, starched and crisp in his uniform
Chief
In here
missed you at the funeral home
Santos said you were here
You didn't miss much
Christ, what a mess
Positive
The woman passenger on the boat that blew up
Oh
There's an awkward pause
Brody sees the box with the divers' stuff sitting where it was left earlier
What about that camera
What camera
That one -- from the wreck
You brought it up, did you look inside it
Hendricks' guilty look confirms he didn't
Well, what the hell -- might be something worth seeing
Take it somewhere and see if there's film in it
(catching on) If there is, develop it
You got it
The Deputy rummages in the locker, happy to be on the trail
know just where to go
Not the drugstore
Of course not, They're closed
Phil Fogarty's place
He'll do it for me
The drugstore's closed
What the hell time is it
Nine-thirty, ten maybe
Shit -- 'm late for dinner
Close up, okay
And he runs for the door, the speed-loaders with the Cyanide bullets safely in his pocket
(at the door) Oh yeah -- 'm expecting a long distance call, very important
Give them my home phone
Right
Brody pats his pockets to make sure the speed-loaders are safe inside, then exits
As Hendricks watches him go, : - Brody's jeep pulls up, and he gets out, beat
He is slouching towards the door when he hears the phone ring inside
He perks up, and starts to move faster
: - Ellen is on the phone in the den as Brody enters the house
The Kids are on the floor in front of the , playing an electronic video game that pings and beeps softly under the following
(into the phone) Thank you
'll tell him
For me
(hanging up) Sort of -- Matthew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring
Damn
He starts upstairs, casually concealing the towel-wrapped package of gun and ammunition
Is Hooper coming to dinner
Not till next year
He goes upstairs, Ellen waits a few beats, then follows him
: -  - Brody comes up the stairs and goes into the bedroom, where he carefully puts the gun in the bed table
Ellen finds him
Oh, hi -- How was dinner
Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair
Where were you
(getting up) Santos' place
They both know what that means -- the morgue
Brody goes into the bathroom and starts scrubbing his hands compulsively
-    - Ellen follows Brody, watches as he washes under too-hot water
Oww
Careful
What's wrong
Nothing
Nothing, huh
That's what  said
Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff
Use the little brush there
Why were you at Santos'
Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal
Oh
Want to talk about it
No
Terrific
Mike comes up the stairs, and is starting into his room when Brody spots him; Sean is just behind him
Michael
Yeah
You want to come here a minute
Mike shrugs and crosses to his father; Sean whizzes past on into his room
Hi Dad
Hiya yourself
What is it
He expects something: this is a formal audience with the Head of The House
got something for you to do tomorrow
kind of had plans
Sailing
(Mike nods) Forget it
You're beached
Grounded
No more boats
Hey, come on
No backtalk
spoke to Upton, at the beach, and he's got a job for you there
You can work until school starts
All summer
He wanted a job, he's got one want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night
We see Sean's door opening as he peeps into the hall to see what the fuss is about
' It opens a few inches, he looks out at the grownups and his brother, decides he wants no part of this, and quietly closes the door
(
) Dad, please
(
) Tomorrow night
Out of the water
Mike silently storms into his room, not-so-silently slamming the door as he exits
From inside the room, loud rock music muffled behind the door -- an expression of teen-age rebellion
Not so loud
The music lowers its volume
Brody turns to go into the bedroom, to take his shoes off, to go to bed
know what you're going to say
Do you
(on the bed) In the city, it happened all the time -- some Kid o
d
's on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies
Call the cops
What are we, immune
It was bad, wasn't it
The goddamn smell is always the same
(he shudders at the recollection) Are you going to be able to sleep
Yeah
think so
(he raises his voice) Mike
Keep it down, for chrissake
Ellen gets up, and quietly closes the door
The upstairs hallway is empty, the doors closed
The Brody household compartmented and closed for the night
: - The familiar striped cabanas flank the white sands; there's a crowd of midweek seasonal tourists and locals oblivious to the tall steel tower that dominates the beach
classy van outfitted for passengers pulls into the parking area, followed by Vaughn's Cadillac; the parking attendant waves them into a preferential area, where they disembark: Vaughn, Peterson, Ellen, and some more prospects, including a woman named Bryant and her daughter, Renee
This is the town beach; the development naturally has its own private access, but  wanted you to see the concession area
Look at that sand -- like sugar
He scoops up a handful of the fine powder
Ellen directs the attention of the photographers
During the summer, the sun sets right there
(she points) Over the water
Beautiful
(to Ellen) 'll say hello for you
Ellen nods, preoccupied
Vaughn strolls away, headed in the direction of the cabanas
Mary Nichols, a local Selectwoman, emerges from behind the counter of one of the concessions
Hello -- selling some more of the good life
piece here, a piece there, it all adds up
Your husband's been here all morning
What's he doing
(good-naturedly) His job
Michael Brody, dressed in township workman's coveralls, is repainting some flaking woodwork
Sean is happily mixing paint
Vaughn joins them
Your dad got you working
Yeah
He continues his chore, without enthusiasm
'm helping
You know where your dad is
Up there
He points at the tower
Oh, for Christ's sake
He crosses briskly to where Peterson is finishing
And if you have any questions about recreational possibilities, Ellen Brody here will be happy to answer them
Len, can  see you a minute
Peterson excuses himself and joins the Mayor
think we got a couple of live ones
Brody's riding his tower
(looking up) Oh, shit
sweeping the water with binoculars, restless eyes trying to scan everything, a grim watchman high over the heads of the unseeing crowd
Larry Vaughn, Jr
comes skimming in close to the surf
Bob is handling the sheets, Larry is giving young Jackie sailing lessons -- at the moment he's showing her how the tiller works
He's on her like glue
This is fun
Can we go faster
(to Bob) Trim
Bob does, Larry trims the main, and the hull lifts
Yay
She snuggles in Larry's arms
He waves to someone
That's my dad
Jackie waves without seeing
Vaughn waves back, preoccupied
Near him, Mike Brody looks up, his face grim, jealous, and now a little nuts
He splashes paint onto the wood with angry abandon
(to Peterson) Wave to my son
(waving) How the hell do we get him down from there
Maybe nobody will notice
Let's get them back in the bus
Mrs
Bryant approaches them, tugging her daughter
Renee wants to know what that man is doing way up there
He's, ah, watching
lookout
For what
(a precocious little girl) It's a shark tower
saw one in Florida
He's looking for sharks
It's an observation platform
That's our Chief of Police
He's just checking it
Normally, it's used for, ah, bird watching
Nature observation
Weather measurements, that sort of thing
(a little desperate) Ellen, we're running late
Okay
Folks, if we could get back on, we'll show you the country club, and stop for lunch
At the mention of lunch, the prospects, all hungry, begin flocking back into the van
Peterson herds them along
The country club has an 18-hole course, putting greens, and twelve tennis courts
: still scanning
His body suddenly tenses
There's something out there
He mashes his binoculars to his eyes, trying to get a better look
() Through the binoculars, something big and black, moving under the buoys and into the swimming area
He can't believe it
But looking past him, we can see it with the unaided eye: a seething dark mass, moving through the water towards the unprotected bathers
(screaming) Out of the water
Everyone out of the water
No one can hear him
few little faces look up, unable to catch what he's saying
He starts climbing down the ladder shouting
Get out of the water
Tell everyone to get out
Now
Out of the water
, , reacting
(recalling another panic) Oh, my God
What the hell is he doing
Oh, no
, , Looking up, startled at Brody's sudden panic
The dark mass almost on top of the swimmers, who are starting to look around
Most of them are oblivious to what's happening on shore
as his feet hit the sand and he starts running for the water, fumbling for his gun and the speed-loader with the cyanide bullets
He is bumping into people, knocking little kids over, stepping on blankets and umbrellas, a madman
Out of the water
Now
Everyone
Running too, half-stumbling, half-believing, remembering
Moving after her husband, while Mike steadies Sean, holding the impulsive kid back
(seeing something) Martin
No
The gun is out now, he's trying draw a bead on the shape in the water; chest heaving, he tries to steady his shaky grip
People see the gun and scream, throwing themselves flat on the sand, running, some of them going into the water
No
Don't go in
Stay out
Stay clear
He fires
Again
Bullets ricochet off the water, howling towards the horizon
Real panic now
Four more shots
Reloading, ejected rounds falling bright into the sand, Brody on his knees, fumbling with bullets
standing on his platform, shocked, watching the Chief of Police fumbling with his gun
It's bluefish
It's a school of bluefish
Chief
It's bluefish
It is bluefish -- a tight mass of them, churning up the water in a dark, dense group
The swimmers look around, confused by the shots and excitement
What's going on
Fish
Anyone got a net
3RD Someone get me a rod and reel
Laughter defuses the tension in the water; bathers move around, some getting closer to see the fish, others leaving the water to join friends and families on the sand
where Brody is now standing, panting, coming down as a crowd collects at a safe distance around him: Ellen emerges from a group that includes Vaughn, Peterson, and Nichols
Sorry
'm sorry
False alarm
Curious crowd murmurs as they watch this lunacy
Brody realizes he's fired his weapon, that spent shells litter the sand at his feet
Okay, it's all over, go on, it's over
No trouble
Ellen joins him
It's okay
It's over
Brody drops to his knees, fumbling for the cyanide bullets in his gun, trying to put things in order, scrabbling in the sand for the empty shells
The crowd is curious and embarrassed
Some turn away, others drift back to their blankets, talking about what's just happened, others stare rudely
Brody is coming apart
It's all right, everything's all right
Sean emerges from the crowd, and helps his daddy pick up the bullets, Ellen moves to disperse the rudely curious
(
) Let's go, everyone
Mrs
Bryant, Len, please
He sees Sean, his eyes fill with tears, and he grabs the kid in a fierce hug
: - hurriedly called meeting of the town's Selectmen is in session: Vaughn, Peterson, and three others: Kaiser, an old man still in his grocery clerk's apron; Sansom; and Nichols, the woman on the beach
Brody's a good man
Nobody says he isn't
You should've been out there
You should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac
There were shots fired
He thought he had a good reason
But that's not rational behavior
That's what 'm saying
How many people were there
Hundred
Literally hundreds
What are they going to say about us
(to Vaughn) Larry, 'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else
So
So
So it can't be done like that
The man's a menace, plain and simple
Look, what am  supposed to do
It's done, it's over
We have to deal with the consequences
That's what we're here to do
All right
Let's go into my office, where we can have a little privacy
' as the selectmen troop into the cramped quarters
Vaughn deliberately closes the door as they find seats around the room
believe we have a quorum, and informally,  suggest we call this meeting an executive session and dispense with minutes
: '  - Brody, alone, is sitting at his desk, morosely studying a little gold statuette of a pistol marksman
What's done is done, and Brody is trying to figure out how to live with it
The phone rings, is answered in the other room
The buzzer sounds
Brody picks up his end
Polly, no calls, please
(she insists) Okay, okay
(he punches a button) Hello
Phil
Fogarty
What pictures
'll be right down
He slams down the phone and gets up to go, suddenly possessed with a purpose
: - Amid the equipment, clutter and proofs, some shots of the holidome opening, drying on wires
Phil Fogarty, the indignant fat man and town photographer, is locking the door behind an impatient Brody
don't know what you did, but that kid stopped
haven't heard one peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for days
Believe me, it's a pleasure
You said something about a camera
Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and  didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in-law, in Montauk, he works at a hi-fi store, and they sell cameras, so he
(interrupting) Did you get any pictures
Well, yeah,  did, that's the funny thing
You can't tell much from the negatives,  was going to blow 'em up
Here's a test  did
He holds out an 8 x 10 proof, Brody snatches it from him
- Brody stares down at it
Sure enough, the ghostly outlines of the Orca, underwater, a diver on the deck making a gesture at the camera
(
) Oh, Jesus
That boat
Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1
4
Look at the diffusion, though
What else you got
Let's see -- you got a minute
Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around
Okay, okay -- stand over there
He gestures, Brody steps to one side of a table with some big enamel pans for washing and developing prints
Phil switches to a red light, and takes some printing paper, putting it under the enlarger
: --  Enlarger light going on
--  Timer ticking, the hand turning
--  Quick negative images: water, boat, diver, hand, boat again, tantalizing fragments of the opening sequence projected on the enlarger's flat base
--  Hypo and Developer sloshing in a pan under Phil's hands
--  Brody staring down
() Quietly gaining contrast in a pan of developer, a print of what at first looks like seaweed, then is unmistakably the grinning jaws of the Great White
- quick nightmare vision of Brody, alone in a sinking Orca, trapped in a battered cabin interior; a Great White crashes through the glass, its head huge as it lunges
() The close-up detail of this otherwise blurred and unreadable photo is unmistakably a detail from a very close view of the snapping jaws of a Great White; if you hadn't seen it as a memory, it would make no sense at all
For Brody, the meaning is all too clear; for anyone who's never seen the monster face-to-face, it's nothing
(
) (shaken) That one there
That one
Phil's hands, holding plastic tongs, gently slosh the print in the bath
The shark's features are indistinguishable from the surrounding detail
: - Brody walks into view, and starts up the steps into the town hall, already lit from within
He's carrying a large envelope
- The Selectmen (Kaiser, Sansom, Nichols), Len Peterson, and Vaughn are seated informally around the big table
(looking up) Speak of the devil
Brody enters, carrying the envelope with the photo
Thank God you guys were all together
got something for you
Proof
Martin, this is kind of an official meeting Perfect
Look at this --- He fumbles with the envelope
Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer
(preoccupied) What
Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim Chief of Police in your absence
Temporarily
Uh
sure
The question's out of left field
Why are they asking
So Jeff could handle things
He knows the routine, he has the authority
Yeah
Why
It came up during the meeting
Look --  just got this from Phil Fogarty
It was in the camera belonging to the missing divers
It proves  was right, all along
He throws the picture down in front of them
They bend over to study it, pass it around, look at it
Seaweed
It's underwater, isn't it
That's why it's so dark
don't know -- what is it
It's a shark
Great White
Jesus, it's right there
He snatches up the photo
Just as before, an ambiguous pattern of light and dark; not proof of anything without Brody's inner vision
(
) It's nothing  can see
waving the picture
What are you all, blind
It's a shark
Look -- teeth, jaw, gills
Is that what it is
You're damn right that's what it is
'm sorry,  just don't see it
Sansom and Kaiser agree, ad lib, "That's nothing
" Martin, it could be anything
(exploding) What the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls
Jesus, it's right there in front of you
know what a goddamn shark looks like, 've been through it, don't you understand
've seen this sonofabitch before
The Selectmen look at each other in the face of Brody's agitation
Tempers are running high
What have you seen before
This is nothing
Seaweed
Mud
Something in the lens
My ass
Be reasonable, please
(to Vaughn) Forget it, he won't listen
There is nothing to discuss
(blowing up) Will you listen to this man
Will you just listen to him
(to Brody) You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody decides to sue us
That could ruin us
Is that what it is
Dollars
Money
'll pay for it
Take it out of my salary
You don't make enough
Maybe  don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but  don't work the same way
What's that supposed to mean
It means  don't like all that grab- ass and heavy breathing with my wife, it means  know who's out to screw me here, and it means that  know something none of you know because 've been there -- and  don't want to go through that horror again
Ever
There's a long pause
Martin, could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something
Go ahead, whatever it's worth
The Selectmen file into Vaughn's office, leaving Brody alone in the room
The last one in the door very carefully makes sure it's tightly shut
Brody sits alone at the table
: '  - They are sitting there, deliberating
won't mention his personal attack on me
've never seen him like this
And Hendricks is qualified, you heard that from his own mouth
We made a motion and it was already seconded
(official) Very well then
It is moved and seconded that Martin Brody be relieved of his duties as Chief of Police, his contract with the township be terminated, and that Jeff Hendricks be appointed Acting Chief in the interim
Those in favor
All the hands go up
Anyone opposed, or is it unanimous
Vaughn's hand goes up, the sole dissent
They stare at him
'm sorry, but  respect his convictions
The motion is carried
He goes to the door, and opens it
Martin
Could you come in please
: - The police jeep pulls up and stops; although the engine's shut down, Brody still sits quietly inside the car
Then his hand appears at the window, and he drops an empty beer can onto the lawn
Clink
After a while, he drops another beer can, then another, until the "clinks" tell us he's polished off a six-pack on the way home
Not too steady on his feet, Brody climbs out of the car and starts for the door to his house
: - Ellen is working at her desk in the den
She is looking towards the door, expectantly -- it's been an unusually long pause between car arrival and husband arrival
Brody enters
Hi
closed a sale today, without Len
That's $1200 commission, if the papers go through
That's great
Sean's asleep
That's great too
Gorgeous
He takes a long look at her
You look about 22 years old sitting there
Like you were doing homework
He goes to join her, bumping into some furniture in the dimly lit room
Ellen has a beer and sandwich half-finished on her desk; Brody takes a healthy swallow from the beer
(sensitive) What's wrong
Ooohh, nothing
just got fired, that's all
He tosses the photo sloppily on the desk
What
What'd  say
That you were fired
Then that's what  meant
Fired
Canned
Out on my fanny
The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police
Just like that
Because of today
The beach
(expansively) No sweat
blessing in disguise
Back to the city, you can go to Bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat
we're surrounded by water here, you realize that
Me, surrounded by water
Ridiculous
Stop that
We're not going any place
You love it here
Tell me what the hell happened
Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life
They didn't see it
Not like me
Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture
He's out there, somewhere
shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me
(studying the photo) Honey, this is nothing
don't know what it is
What did they
(going on) Everybody wants the job
No one wants the authority
Except Hendricks
Fine
He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me
Call me in New York
tell him to kiss my ass
(seeing his pain) They have no right to treat you like that
You've given them everything
For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island
Fired me
(at Ellen) 'm not a hysterical man
'm responsible
know what  saw
know you did
try
Goddamnit,  tried
Now, 'm tired
can't keep fighting it
'm too tired
'm
'm
Brody's slipping under; the beers and the day have finally overcome him
He slumps in Ellen's arms
You're drunk is what you are
She eases him onto the couch, tucking a comforter over his inert shape
Take it easy
Easy
Sean comes down the stairs, sleepy, in his pajamas
Is dad home
heard something
He comes into the darkened den
Shhhh
Go back upstairs
Daddy's sleeping
Sean finds the photo, and stares at it idly
What's this
Nothing, sweetheart
Seaweed
She takes him by his sleepy hand and leads him out of the room, leaving Brody tucked in on the couch, dead to the world
: - This is the Amity teen-ager's hangout -- a newsstand and pinball arcade with a minimal refreshment counter where soft drinks and submarine sandwiches are dispensed
jukebox is blaring some n
d
rock music
Present are Donnie, Doug, Timmy, Bob, Larry Vaughn Jr
, Brooke, Marge, Denise, Jane, Andy, and Mike
The boys are passing around hot-rod van and custom boat magazines; the girls are looking at Silver Screen, Tiger Beat, People, and Time
Andy and Mike are at the counter, splitting a sandwich
(holding a book) That's what  want -- a gaff rig
Gaff rigged
Why not a staysail schooner
Go anywhere
Look at this -- the Mayan, an Alden schooner
Hey, Mike --  saw your dad over at the town hall
know
(innocently) Did he really freak out at the beach
don't know
Hey, it's all bullshit
Anyone want to play pong for money
No one does
There's a bustle at the door, and some couples enter from the movies: Patrick and Lucy, Ed and Tina, Polo and Jackie
There are a lot of ad-lib greetings; How was the show
Yech
It was okay
'd rather go the lighthouse
Who wouldn't
Anyone want to go the lighthouse
Now
At night
Nah
Tomorrow
Early, spend the day
My folks left two cases of beer in the garage
Is it still there
Nope
Got it in my boat
All-right
Let's go for it
There's a general ad-lib agreement to organize a day's sailing picnic
Mike, you going
Why shouldn't
thought you might still be painting the restrooms at the beach
Laughter from the gang
Anyone want a coke or anything
They break up into pairs and trios, some going for the soda fountain, others hanging out by the magazines
'd like to go out to the lighthouse with you
'm not sure  can
It'll be fun, come on
Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach
No way
Everybody's going sailing
If you don't want to take me, just say so
That's not it
My dad told me not to go
You do everything your parents tell you
No
Good
'll be on the dock at eight
(to the gang) Eight o'clock, everybody
They ad lib agreement
(aside to Mike) really want to to be there
(to the crowd) Who's bringing the wine
And who's got a quarter for the box
Brooke takes Mike aside, as Jackie goes to the jukebox
Larry is right there with a quarter, standing next to her as they select a tune
She just likes to tease
think she really likes you
Great
Some rock music starts, and we: : - Ellen is asleep under the covers, Brody, still in his clothes from the night before, is sprawled on top; obviously he's stumbled upstairs sometime during the night
There's a noise down the hall, from Mike's room
Brody stirs, but doesn't wake up
: '  - Mike is holding a lamp that's almost fallen -- the noise we just heard
He's almost dressed, but not quite satisfied with his image in the mirror
He takes off his clean shirt, and checks a more comfortable, worn shirt
brief sniff to make sure it's okay for another day, and he puts it on; he tiptoes to the hall, where a noise stops him in his tracks
- Mike is frozen in his part-opened bedroom door
Sean's door opens, and little Sean, also fully dressed, comes sneaking out
(whispering) You're going out
Yeah
You're going sailing
Maybe
Take me
No
(louder) want to go with you
Quiet
Shhh
(even louder) Michael
Okay, okay
Close your door
Sean does, and happily tiptoes with exaggerated stealth to Mike; the two of them start downstairs
: Michael and Sean are walking away towards the road into town
: - Brody emerges from the bathroom, dressed in sweatshirt, and cutoffs: no uniform today
He starts downstairs, stopping only to look into Mike's room
It's empty
Good morning, America
grin crosses his face -- "My son, the Don Juan
" He goes downstairs
: - Brody enters from upstairs
He heats coffee
Ellen enters dressed for work
He pours two cups
What're you going to do today
Turn in the car
Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss
'll give notice
Don't rush into it -- we may need the income
She pours the coffee, they drink it for a moment
Mike left early
Couldn't wait to make out
Must be a morning man
Ellen and Brody sip their coffee quietly for a few moments
Mrs
Silvera arrives, carrying groceries
Morning
Anything special today
Sean's not up yet
You know what he likes, just some Fruit Loops and milk
No candy
The sink upstairs is busted
Try some Drano, or a plunger, maybe
Or call your brother, the plumber, what's his name
Frankie
He's my cousin
Frankie
Okay
Ask him if he needs an apprentice
Brody and Ellen are at the door
Have a nice day
They leave
: - The Kids are into their boats, fitting out for a day of recreational offshore sailing
Mike and Andy are readying his Tornado, while Sean gets in the way
In the b
g
, Hendricks can be seen puttering around on the Amity police boat
If you're beached, why are we doing this
For practice
Yeah
Then why are we futzing around the dock
We can make a few bucks working at the beach
Sean knocks something over, Mike snaps at him
Look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home
'm not in the way
Andy, am  in the way
You're always in the way
Marge joins them, scooping Sean up
This guy giving you any trouble
Put me down
Put him down in the water
(to Sean) You want to go out in my boat
Yeah
Would you take him
Sure
You've just made someone very happy
Marge and Sean go over to her Lightening
Brooke and Jackie come down the dock, dressed for sailing
Mike
Are you going out
Maybe
thought you were grounded
can go out if  want to
You can
You going to the lighthouse
Why not
could give you a dozen good reasons
(to Andy) Shut up
Okay, okay, don't say  didn't remind you
Is there room on your boat for all of us
Mike looks: Andy, Jackie, Brooke, himself
Timmy moves in, sensing the chance of a lifetime
Well, we're pretty crowded, and don't know when we're leaving
Timmy makes his move
've got room
Great
(to Andy) That's okay -- 'll go with Timmy
You will
Sure
And she walks towards his boat, looking back for him to follow
He's dumbstruck by his sudden good fortune
Fan-tas-tic
He runs to join her, untying mooring lines like crazy; they're together again at last for the first time
Andy is left shuffling with Mike and Jackie
'm ready
And she plops down in Mike's boat, ready to be taken
Anywhere
Come on, you guys
Well,  don't know
Jackie flashes him one of her pouty little smiles
Why break one heart when you can break two
Or more
Please come with us
Mike is glaring
The message is clear, if unspoken
For me
What the hell
For you
Andy joins them
Mike casts off, while Andy helps, and Jackie sits there, looking cute
watching what's going on
thought you said she was going with us
Let's just go sailing, okay
(casting off) Want to talk about it
Want to swim home
Bob gets the message and shuts up
The Sizzler fills its sails, and points out of the harbor
Lots of day-sailing Kids, a few bigger, adult boats, some working fishermen and sport fishers; a typical recreational boating mix
The Kids are finding the same general direction, pointing out of the harbor
-- Sails being trimmed
--  Brooke and Timmy, staring into each other's eyes as he sets a course straight for the lighthouse
--  Larry, lifting a hull, almost losing Bob
- The Kids' boats, in a loose bunch, slipping out to sea
- The dive class boat, isolated near the channel, a group of Kids in wet suits and tanks assembled with three adult instructors: Tom Andrews, Crosby, and Sparky
- Andrews and his assistant instructor, Sparky, are addressing the class, when Mike and Andy's "Green Machine" sails by, close
Hey
Nicholas
You're supposed to be in class
Today 'm staying topside
You dive for me
'm going for lobster
Great
Find one for me
With butter, if they got any
Andrews dismisses them with a good-natured wave
So long, turkies
He turns to his class
Sparky will take you down today
If everyone's got a buddy, we'll drop
The class dutifully lines up and starts going in, while in the b
g
the Kids sailboats head out to sea
Andrews' two partners, Crosby and Sparky, get ready to follow the class over
(to Andrews) Let's get some dinner
He goes over, Andrews following
Sparky is with the class, signaling "Down;" they submerge like clumsy seals
: The class, paired up, is drifting down; Sparky offering encouragement as they descend
Andrews and Crosby are already disappearing, swimming away with strong kicks
as they go over the edge of a shelf and drop into darker, deeper waters
Crosby checks his depth, his watch, looks around
far above him, the class, going about their business
Below him, murk, depth, and suddenly, a big lunker bass
Andrews sees it, too
- Assuming Crosby is following, he takes off, following the big lunker
Crosby, hung up in some minor equipment problem, misses seeing him go
The two men are separated
Follow Andrews as he twists and turns after the bass, going deeper, losing him in the rocks, suddenly rounding a boulder, and meeting, almost face-to-face, horror: The Great White Shark, taking the striper in a single gulp, it's looking up at Andrews with one glassy doll's eye; it turns to face him directly, and we see the scar; ugly, red and black, charred flesh from jaw back on the right side, eyes and teeth gleaming like raw bone in the massive, uncaring face
Andrews' mouth clamps violently on his mouthpiece, then goes wide as he screams in fear into the water
Finning backwards, he ditches his weights, gulps for air, and yanks the cord on his safety vest
It balloons out, and pulls him up, surging towards the surface
The mouthpiece, useless, falls away from his lips
Eyes closed, hose dangling, Andrews hurtles upward, holding his breath in a final, fatal panic, passing a startled Crosby
look over at the rocketing ascent
What's wrong
Sparky signals "up," and they begin to carefully follow him towards the surface
Crosby's already surfacing
: - Andrews is on his side, bloody froth on his lips
One of the class is clinging to his legs, trying to arrest his convulsions
Sparky is holding his shoulders, trying to administer mouth-to-mouth
Get us in
For Christ's sake, get us in
In his arms, Andrews writhes, pain knotting his limbs
Behind them, in the water, the fin surfaces, and casually turns towards
the ocean
The Shark is headed for the sea
And for the now distant Kids in their sailboats, dotting the horizon in their familiar bright colors
: -   '  - They are alone
In the middle distance, the rest of the Kids' sails can be seen, headed for the lighthouse in the distance
The Sandpiper's sails are luffing, they're making no headway
You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this
(snuggling close) Just like this
What about sailing
The tide's running
It'll take us to the light
It'll take us to Budapest if you're not careful
Ed is lashing the rudder as they continue to drift with the current
First things first
He fumbles in a cooler chest, produces a bottle of wine
What about the others
They'll be there when we get there
Might even have a fire started
What're we going to do in the mean time
dunno
We'll think of something
He pours the wine into the two paper cups
But first, a little juice
And second
(kissing her) Mmmmmm
(resisting) Wait a minute
Promise me something
Anything
Anything
That you'll put down a blanket
've got black and blue marks all over my butt, and my Mom's getting uptight about them
You got it
And he fumbles for a blanket in a locker, thumping and banging gear around as he rummages for it
Tina sips wine contentedly, satisfied to wait
The Sandpiper's hull, alone above us, as the Shark rises with dreadful certainty, attracted by the erratic sounds of Ed's hasty search
- The terrible fin breaks the surface, about 20 yards out, then dips and disappears
Then, impossibly fast, the entire Sandpiper is lifted from underneath by a powerful surge, as the Shark lunges up against it from below, an unseen horror
Ed is knocked over the side, into the water
as he breaks the surface, shaking the hair out of his eyes, trying to orient himself, finding the boat
He starts to swim for it, Tina extending an arm to help him climb aboard
, He has barely taken two strokes when a powerful force takes him from below the surface, rushing him towards us through the water
Tina screams
Before Ed can react to the pain, he is slammed face first into the boat
His jaw breaks, blood smears his nose and lip
His hands grab the wooden-cap rail with a death-grip
Tina is staring down at the water, terror-stricken; Ed's arms and head are f
g
, as he locks onto the boat with desperate hands
Ed's hands on the rail, knuckles white, an iron grip
With awful finality, the force pulls down, and the wood shatters and splits away as Ed's hands are pulled down and under by the awful force
her mouth working silently, unable to scream, staring down at the blood and froth on the water, swirling in a grim eddy under her, the Sandpiper rocking gently in the diminishing swell
-  - On the way to the lighthouse, but away from the harbor, the Kids are sailing in fairly close order: The sloops (Polo, Timmy, Marge) heeled well over in the stiff breeze, the faster cats (Mike, Larry, Donny, etc
) skimming around, tacking more often, faster and more maneuverable
Faster
Faster
Coming about
She ducks under the boom, handling the jib sheets with easy familiarity
They come about and scoot off on a new tack
Reading the wind, trimming sail expertly, competent and alone
(to a near-by boat) Great day
think the wind's going to change
He comes about, she slides into him, he holds her to steady her, she snuggles into his arms
True love, at last
He's thrilled
In his inflatable, poking slowly along
Marge passes him, Sean hooting with glee
Coming up
Slowpoke
Slowpoke
Marge is faster
'm getting new sails, then watch out
Just a question of modifying the rigging
' " " Jackie, Mike and Andy, clipping along, Larry Vaughn and Bob in the Sizzler nearby
Mike lifts the hull, Jackie squeals in delight
Wheee
Faster
How fast is enough
want to go faster
Hang on
He trims his sheets, the cat heels more, one hull flying, Andy and Jackie clinging to the trampoline
Larry is carefully adjusting his tiller, Bob senses what he's doing
You coming up on him
You bet
Hang on
They gybe sharply, running up behind the green cat
Coming up
Give way
Like hell
We're on the starboard tack
" " Running close to each other; very tight two-by-two
Don't let him pass
Faster
Mike and Larry silently fight for clean air, racing
Water splashes over them
My hair's getting wet
So's mine
' He veers onto a less dramatic tack, sparing Jackie's hair
Larry and Bob speed by, yelling
When do we get to the lighthouse
Soon, dark eyes, soon
The tide's turning
Andy reveals a knowledgeable side to his character
We're going to be fighting the current
(he looks up) Wind's backing around a few points, too
Jackie snuggles against Mike
can't wait to get there
But of course
He goes forward to trim the jib, leaving the lovebirds snuggling astern
They pull away from us, and we: : - Ellen and Brody are in the jeep; he's driving her to work
There's a crowd at dockside, and the town ambulance's now familiar blinking red light
Brody, out of force of habit, wheels the jeep towards the action, nudging through the crowd, which gives way to the official blue-and-white vehicle
Hey -- it's not your job any more
'm going to be late for work
Just one minute
He gets out, and pushes through the crowd, Ellen following
The dive boat is moored at a clumsy angle next to the Police Boat, where Hendricks has been pulling routine maintenance
The Police launch is cluttered with tools and spare parts; some non-essential piece of gear is stripped and laid out on the deck
Hendricks is on the dive boat, kneeling next to Andrews
Andrews is shaking, bloody froth on his lips and chest
The shaken divers are huddled together, an ambulance attendant is wheeling a gurney into position
Crosby and Sparky are stunned
What the hell happened
Embolism
Air bubbles in his blood
Came up too damn fast
Held his goddamn breath
He is near collapse himself
Easy
He panicked
Something scared him
An Ambulance Attendant is putting a blanket around Sparky
It's okay
We're taking care of him
The other attendant holds something out to Brody
Brody examines it; a scuba mouthpiece, bitten in two, useless
How'd this happen
Bite reflex, like a spasm
When
Right after, the Kids went out
What Kids
Who went out
All of them
Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang
Mike
Our Mike
Yep
Looked like they were headed to the lighthouse
How long ago
About an hour, maybe two
(thinking) Let's see --  came on about eight
Brody is gone, pushing through the crowd
Brody is casting off lines
Ellen is on the dock, watching him
What're you doing
Going out
Uh, Chief -- look
You're not Chief any more
Brody keeps working, making ready for sea
can't let you take her out
You can't stop me
Ellen is climbing aboard, taking off her heels
Mrs
Brody, look -- if he can't go, then you can't go
Neither of you can go
'm going
Mike's out there
But  signed for the boat
You're not authorized any more
Brody starts the engines with a roar, and slams it into reverse
The boat starts out of the slip, then lunges to a halt, shuddering on its still-fastened bow mooring line
Untie that rope
Please
It's my job
'll do it
And she moves purposefully towards the boat cleat
Mrs
Brody, please
Brody is shifting gears, the boat is crabbing sideways as he puts the helm hard over
It bumps the dock, hard
You're too close
Back off
Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there
Hendricks goes to the bow, jumps aboard and frees the bow line
The boat slips into reverse, the water boiling as Brody guns it away from the dock
Let me
Please
He takes the wheel, eases off on the rudder, and comes about, pointing the launch out to sea
Hurry, please
What the hell, they can't fire both of us -- someone's got to be in charge, right
Which way are we going
Find the Kids
The lighthouse -- you said something about the lighthouse
Get us there
The Amity Police Boat, Brody, Ellen and Hendricks aboard, is headed under full power out to sea
Hendricks is pumping the horn, warning boats out of the way, ignoring the rules of the road; as small boats scatter out of the way, we can see the ambulance, red light flashing, pushing out slowly through the crowd at dockside
: - As they clear the harbor mouth, Brody is on the radio, Ellen is crouching in the shelter of the deckhouse, Hendricks is steering
Amity Launch to Harbor Patrol, over
(
) (filtered) Harbor Patrol
Is that you, Brody
Affirmative
Can you get your chopper airborne
10-4, in a few minutes
He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse
Right now
What for
There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way
Turn them back to port
That's it
That's it
Just do it, all right
10-4, soon as  can raise him
If they're not at the light, look for them
don't want them out there
Get them back to port
(exasperated) Affirmative, affirmative
Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port heard you
Patrol out
As Brody's eyes sweep the horizon anxiously, Hendricks pours it on, and the police boat surges forward
: -  - Donnie and Denise and Susie are sailing close to each other
Hungry
Starving
Let's go eat now
(shouting to Susie) We're going in to eat
She nods agreement, their boats veer off from the rest and head towards the lighthouse
: as it sails close to the Green Machine
Hey
Brody
Want to race
(confident) Sure
How about a side bet to make it interesting
That's fun
Let's race for something
Name it
Loser sails home alone
(aside to Mike) You're betting what you already got
don't care
love it
Sure you do -- you win either way
(simply) 'm supposed to
It's a bet
Once around the marker buoy
That's the pin -- the buoy
Larry is confident -- he's got the air, but Mike suddenly gybes without warning, snapping onto a new fast tack, downwind
Larry and Bob are caught by surprise, and lose precious moments as they fumble with their sails
(pulling away) Turkeys
Eat wind
Yee-hah
He pounds with glee on the canvas trampoline as their boat moves ahead, a drumming sound
The twin hulls of a catamaran's hull, the muffled, eerie sound of drumming, as the water carries the tempting "thud- thud-thud" sound down to the deep
falling behind as the boats change course for the marker buoy, following Larry and Mike's lead
Hey
Wait for the
Invincible
Brooke and Timmy sail by him, laughing; Polo with them
Can't -- we're watching a race
Since when
Who's racing
Larry and Mike
Pat and Lucy are trimming sail, moving faster
Mike and Larry are racing
Loser goes home alone
If we beat them, they can both go home stag
Single-
Alone
Jackie can come back in this boat
What about me
Uh
Well
Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in
(snapping him with a rope) Your ass  will
Besides, the wind's turning with the tide
Sailing back is going to be a bitch
- --  Ropes and sails rattling through blocks
--  Sails snapping taut, filling with wind
--  Catamarans heeled over, racers hanging over the water, dangerously suspended in trapeze harnesses
--  Skippers' faces, concentrating on boat handling
- It's the chopper's point of view, as the Harbor Patrol copter from the Cape flies towards the Kids, following Brody's previous instructions
He sees the sailboats and fly that way
(filtered, into his mike) Air Patrol to Base
have visual contact on the Kids
Going down to use the loud hailer
It approaches the sailboats, losing altitude fast, rotor blades chuffing up a storm
The Pilot has his microphone to his lips, and his voice is blaring down at them
(
) This is the Harbor Patrol
Return to port immediately
Return -- to -- port -- immediately
The Kids look at each other, some coming about awkwardly, others luffing, wondering what this is all about
(to Mike) Your dad must be really pissed
We better go back in
It's not going to be easy
What's wrong
We're fighting wind and current though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide
Putz -- that won't be for hours
was counting on hours
(
) Return -- to -- port
We're trying, we're trying
He waves acknowledgement, and puts about
The others take their cue from him, and set a rough course back, but without much success
Heading back
Might as well
Polo, Timmy and Brooke, Marge and Sean
They see the faster catamarans come about and try to beat back
They're turning around
Coming about, then
Are we going back
Going to try
Lighthouse, everybody
She puts about, the three of them start back towards the lighthouse, not making much headway
Doug's inflatable is the slowest, and he is now, by virtue of his position, at the head of the line beating back towards the island
' The others in the b
g
Make way for the Carrier Enterprise
- It whistles and visibly leaks under the strain
looking down in dismay
Make that the Titanic
He rigs a little foot pump, and begins thumping away, trying to breath air back into the raft
- Patrol One to Base
Looks like they're turning back
All right, Patrol
Go back to work
You've wasted enough time
Looking up at the scattered hulls of the sailboats, the turbulence from the low-flying chopper making a vast circular pattern of irregular vibrations
It wheels around, and heads back towards land
: - Rushing through the seas under full power
About three hundred yards ahead, a small, seemingly empty sailboat; Ed and Tina's Sandpiper
Further off, a day-sailing power cruiser, sport fishing
Michael
It's not his boat
Hendricks maneuvers closer, slowing the engine, reversing in time to bring them alongside with a gentle bump
Ellen watches apprehensively as Brody drops into the little boat
Be careful
Anything
(on the Sandpiper) Nope
(he sees something) Hold on
Brody moves around on the deck of the Sandpiper, until he discovers Tina, cowering in shock; a sudden revealing of a terrorized victim
Tina
(a moan) -o-o-o-o-o-o
It's okay, it's okay
What's the matter
Tina
Honey
Hey -- No
It's still there
What is it
What's there
It's still there
(to Hendricks and Ellen) need a hand here
Hendricks has gotten a blanket, and he steps over, putting it over the shivering girl's shoulders
Ellen comforts the girl
Tina, baby
what is it
Sh
Sh
Shark
- knew it
goddamn well told them
He moves abruptly, stepping up onto the police launch, snapping on the radio, leaving Hendricks, Ellen and Tina on the sailboat moored alongside
Amity Launch to Harbor Patrol
(
) (filter) This is Cape Patrol -- what is it, Brody
heard you weren't chief anymore
Skip that
What about those kids out sailing
(
) It's all okay -- Colby got to them
They were turning back when he left 'em
He left them
(
) Sure
He's got work to do in Bay Channel
Get him the hell back there
We got possible fatalities
Brody out
His eyes wild, Brody looks over at the Sandpiper, then scans the nearby waters with sudden tension
' Ellen and Hendricks comforting Tina on the Sandpiper
Nearby, a big cabin cruiser casually trolling by
Brody pulls the police boat's air horn, the cruiser's passengers look over, Hendricks and Ellen jump at the unexpected blast
'm going out there
Hey -- you can't do that
What is it
What's the matter
Mike's out there
Brody starts the launch's motor, throwing clear the mooring line that ties the two boats together
(to Hendricks) Get her in
Get them both in
Martin, please
Chief, be sensible
Where are they
About 10 degrees off your starboard bow, take a heading leeward of Sand Island, and lay her north by northeast
Never mind that shit
Just point
Hendricks complies
(pointing) See where Cable Junction is
Look to the left
The lighthouse
That's it
Got it
And he kicks the engine into gear, moving the launch away and out toward the sea
Come back
Martin
He guns the engine as soon as he's clear
Hendricks gives his jacket to a suddenly chilled Ellen, and hails the cabin cruiser, already changing course to pick them up, sounding its horn
Ellen stares after the receding boat
My purse is on that boat
: -  -  ' They are trying to beat back towards the lighthouse, fighting wind and tide
Only Doug's inflatable, with its clumsy little motor, is making any headway
playing at being Charles Laughton
Mr
Christian
Mr
Christian
Pump up this boat
And shave that silly moustache
Pumping, steering, he's floundering along
- The Shark has fixated on something -- one outlying shape, the easily identifiable outline of Doug's inflatable, thumping and putting
It homes in on the sound
The other kids exchange banter with Doug in his raft, as he clowns for their benefit
England expects every man to do his duty
You may fire when ready, Gridley
Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead
Despite his pumping, the bulging patch bursts with a loud bang
Oh, shit
Someone pop your balloon
No problem, no problem
Want a lifesaver
How about a skyhook
You sail your boat, 'll sail mine
fin rises partially, almost invisible to most of the kids, but Mike notices it, believing it to be a porpoise
Hey, Fetterman -- You got company
Company
The place is a mess
Before anyone can react, the shape rises behind Doug, striking his raft a terrible blow
Whoops
: , Not making any headway themselves, they casually watch the class clown, wondering what he's up to this time
' a distance from the rest
It shakes, then blows up as big teeth grip it from below
Doug goes flying into the drink
The Shark has the inflatable in his teeth, and is shaking it from side to side
Doug's eyes bug out as he sees what's going on
He begins treading water, backing away as fast as he can, waving his arm in the air frantically -- "pick me up, quick
" ' Doug's down
He sails to where Doug is being carried along by the current
The inflatable is a mess -- shredded rubber and dead engine; the Shark didn't like it
Doug
This way
Doug carefully -- oh, so carefully -- strokes over to where Mike and Andy can pull him abroad
Some of the others sail closer to get a look
What was that about
You okay
What was that
So much for the rubber duck
, This incident hasn't yet touched them -- no one actually saw what it was, except Doug, who's never been serious about anything
Until now
shark ate my boat
Come on
'm telling you, a goddamn shark ate my goddamn boat
If he liked your boat,  got some sneakers he'll love
There's nervous laughter from all around as they examine the remains of Doug's inflatable
Some of those jagged rents could be made by teeth
(ad lib) Jeez -- what did that porpoise, maybe
Nah, killer whale
think he snagged it
hate to pop his balloon
(Etc
) ' Doug's inflatable is draped over the tip of one hull, forward
Without warning, the Shark hits
Screams, terror, confusion
Mike, Andy, Jackie into the water
His head bangs on a metal fitting as the boat turns over
Patrick and Lucy ram into Timmy's boat, locking into it, knocking Timmy into the water as Brooke screams
As the following events take place: --  Larry's red cat rams and locks onto Mike's Tornado
--  Marge's boat capsizes, putting Sean and Marge into the drink
--  Marge scrambles up on the over-turned hull, pulling Sean up with her, just in time
--  Polo, under full sail, scoops Mike out of the water before the Shark can get to him
--  The Shark dips out of sight
,      ' showing the results of the turmoil: As they make ineffectual, frightened moves towards grouping together, Andy is the first to gain any composure
Raft up
Raft 'em up
He reaches towards a drifting line, and pulls Timmy's Doughdish towards them, tying it off as it comes close
Tie off to your strongest point
Anyone need an extra line
Polo has Mike and Timmy aboard his boat
Timmy is looking up from examining Mike's dazed body
Mike's bleeding
Can you sail
(testing his rudder) Yeah
We'll take him in
He starts to make sail back towards the lighthouse, on a severe, but manageable tack
Polo, Timmy, and the injured Mike sail towards safety, leaving the others behind
Tackle the job at hand, concentrating on survival
Jackie is strangely quiet; things are out of control
: - clearly marked: Amity Island, Amity Lighthouse, Cable Junction
Brody's nervous finger traces an approximation of his course
It fumbles, pauses, stops
- Brody, looking up from his chart, scans the ocean
Ahead is the Lighthouse, his immediate destination
Out of sight to the right, Cable Junction, and beyond that, 2500 miles of cold Atlantic
Brody looks up from his chart, and grabs the radio
(on radio) Amity Launch to Patrol Air Unit One
Harbor Air, where are you
(
) (filter) This is Air One
That you, Brody
It's me
Any fix on those Kids
(
) Negative
'm still down
For Christ's sake, get going
'm all alone out here
(
) Brody,  got to switch frequencies, call my boss
We'll meet you over by Francis Shoal
Harbor Air out
Where the hell is Francis Shoal
Static
No answer
Brody realizes something 'm all alone out here
The Amity Police Boat, under full power, surging through the heavy swell, Brody very much alone at the helm
,    - We can see Brody's boat approaching
It slows as it nears the island
staring, perplexed
Which way
Shit
He puts the wheel over, slewing the boat around
To the left -- the wrong way
,
It barrels off to the left
: floating in the current, drifting away from the lighthouse, towards the open sea
Floating on the wreckage and tangled boats are:  Doug, Andy, Jackie, Patrick, Lucy, Larry, Bob, Brooke, Marge, and Sean
Anyone know what time it is
3:30
Damn
Larry, Bob, Patrick, and Lucy (the practiced sailors) ad lib equal dissatisfaction
What's wrong
Tide doesn't turn for three hours
Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p
m
What'd you do
Memorize the tide tables
can't help it, it sticks in my mind
(making light of it) Anyone want to play charades
No one does
As long as we're drifting, might as well go with the flow
Not funny
Three knot current
At least
And an offshore wind
What's after Cable Junction
The Atlantic
Then Ireland
Can't we stop
Silence from the group
They're probably looking for us
What about the fish
Maybe it's gone
They tend to follow moving things
Maybe it's following Polo and Timmy
They consider this
So all we have to do is land at Cable Junction and wait
First we got to get there
How're we going to do that floating on this garbage
Anyone got another set of sails
The Kids scramble to rig whatever canvas is available
Is that big thing still out there
Shhhh
: () - panorama of open ocean; a quick fly-by to orient us: First, Cable Junction, then, a mile or so ahead, the raft
More sail, some improvised rigging, Patrick and Lucy trimming what there is, trying to steer the clumsy contraption
From afar, the distant sound of an approaching chopper
Hey
(waving) Over here
The Kids react with enthusiasm to the arrival of the rescue chopper
Don't everyone jump around
But they ignore him
The copter is descending
- one-man light spotter; the space next to the pilot cluttered with tools and floats, lashed in place
Below, seen through the plastic bubble, the raft growing larger as the chopper sets down
Air One to Base
have a positive location on that sailing party
Disabled and adrift
(he checks chart on his knee board) about 3/4 miles west of Cable Junction, wind and current carrying them just about due east
count ten juveniles
The helicopter is creating a lot of turbulence as it sets down, a huge circular pattern of prop-wash on the surface as the rotors slow to a halt
The Kids are waving and jubilant
As the Pilot unbuckles, opens the door, and steps out on one pontoon; he speaks through a bullhorn
Everyone okay
Any injuries
The Kids ad-lib in the affirmative
Can you put us on Cable Junction
got no room for passengers
How about a tow
Can you rig that
The Pilot nods
Larry heaves a line to him, the Pilot catches it and makes it fast to a convenient tie-off on the undercarriage
As soon as you get us on the island, you got to call in
My dad's the mayor
(interrupting) There's a shark
The other Kids all chime in, adding their ad-lib shouts describing what happened, calling for help, etc
It's all a noisy jumble, the Pilot ignores it, trying to do his job
The Kids all shouting at once; Jackie is screaming
You have to take us off
You have to
Why don't you take us
(calming her) It's an observation spotter, he doesn't have the room
He finishes tying off, and yells through his bullhorn at the Kids
Listen
'm going to give you an assist to get you on Cable Junction
Then 'll call in, and get the Coast Guard to send a cutter
Hang on to something
He climbs into his bubble, shuts the door, gives the Kids a "thumbs up," and starts the engine
- Engine turning over
line tied off to one of the ringbolts on an overturned hull; it pulls taut out of the water
,
The raft, Kids watching in fascination and anticipation
The whole operation, getting under way
looking up at pontoons, wreckage, wind turbulence on the surface, the heavy "thud-thud-thud" of chopper blades
In the f
g
, the fin rises, and starts for the scene
Follow it
as it starts to lift, inexplicably
The Pilot reacts as; attacks one of the pontoons, biting down on it, clamping great scarred jaws onto the bulbous floats
Kids screaming
--  Rotor blade spinning wildly
--  Pilot's hands jerked on the delicate controls
--  Med
shot, copter shaking
--  Closeup engine and gas tanks, rotor head spinning
--  Med
closeup Pilot in buffeting cockpit
The Kids watch, horror-stricken, as the giant Shark hangs on the roaring copter; in the b
g
, Cable Junction is looming closer
The copter tilts dangerously, the Shark bites deeper, harder
as it tilts
Then, the unspeakable -- the blades touch the water and explode
Chunks of murderous steel break off the shattered blades and whistle through the air like projectiles
reacting, ducking in terror
Huge chunks of disintegrating rotors are flying all around
Masts and sails left standing before are chopped into a deadly salad
Screams
as blades skip and crash, the bubble of the overturned copter, Pilot trapped inside, sinks into the sea
- Pilot struggling with his safety harness, trying to hit switches, working on instinct
Some air in the bubble, but water too, and sparks as electrical connections short out and burn
Then, the Shark, powering out of the murk
- as grim death batters at his fragile bubble
Screaming
The bubble cracks
Water floods, teeth snap at the slippery plastic, the Pilot fumbles for oxygen as the Shark veers off into the murk
- The Kids, reacting as the broken copter sinks beneath the waves
Calm for a moment, then: Look out
(screams) No-o-o-o
The Shark reappears, and batters at the raft
The raft shudders, and begins to break up under the pounding
The Kids cling for their lives to masts and wreckage
Marge's overturned hull is struck a fierce blow from beneath
Help
He and Marge topple into the water
Don't struggle
Sean is bobbing in his life-vest, Marge strokes to be near him
in the water, swimming for the apparent safety of the raft
Then, the fin, and the massive bulk of the killer, heaving up through the waves
Sean
She heaves him up out of the water, hurling him with desperation towards the safety of the floating hull
screaming, hands and feet scrabbling like a monkey as he struggles for a grip on the slippery surface
Behind him, Marge helping as much as she can from the water
Then, behind her; rising like grey doom, then dropping out of sight
Marge is gone
Marge ducking under the bulk of the Shark, shoving off with panicky reserves of strength, swimming away underwater, while the Shark takes a massive crunching bite out of a submerged hull
Follow Marge as she swims
Huddled in the cracked plastic bubble, the Pilot is sucking air from his oxygen tank
He sees Marge, and slips out of his bubble, headed for her
As the Pilot overtakes her -- a moment of horror, as she thinks the Shark has found her, then relief, as the Pilot motions to the bubble, and indicates "Air
" She follows him
Scuttling like two crabs into the shelter of the broken chopper, buddy breathing as he passes her the oxygen tube
The chopper tilts, and moves, breaking up on the bottom as currents move it
They struggle silently
as it slips across the bottom, the current pulling it, broken parts breaking off in slow motion, dirty swirls of oil and hydraulic fluid clouding the water
: - parallel struggle for survival, as the current separates Sean from the other Kids; Marge is gone, the little boy is clinging alone to the free-floating Lightening
Sean
Sean
Don't move
Andy
Please help
Help
- Copter wreckage is bubbling up from underneath, like a submarine destroyed by depth charges; an oil slick, pieces of broken blade, a seat cushion, then, suddenly, the Pilot, and Marge, almost choked to death, their air run out
They cling to a section of pontoon, panting, looking around with oxygen-starved eyes
They are alone on the ocean; a half-mile away, the distant sails of the broken raft, and the low-lying shape of Cable Junction
Safe, for now
: -      - He throttles down, and the boat slumps in the water
He looks around, sees nothing, in all directions
He hits his radio
Harbor Air, this is Brody
Air One, come in
Static, no answer
He tries a couple of times, checking the knobs and dials to make sure the unit's working
Harbor Air, do you read
Over
Brody
This is Patrol Base
The familiar voice is tinged with annoyance
He's had a long shift, and nothing's going right
Where the hell is Air One
That's what 'd like to know
Lost transmission at Cable Junction
Did he raise the Kids
Last transmission said ten juveniles
Yeah
Then what
Then nothing
If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself
Did you say Cable Junction
That's what he said
When
1530 hours
Might still be there
Base out
Brody revs up, and powers out, headed for Cable Junction
: -  - Sean is crying on his isolated perch, clinging to the upturned keel
The other Kids are throwing a rope, trying to get him back
Patrick heaves, and misses
Sean
Catch the rope
The rope
The rope
The others shoot fearful glances at the waters
He's got to help or it won't work
Sean, baby, please
Sean is ignoring the efforts to rescue him, paralyzed by fear, he shivers alone
Jackie is near catatonia herself, Brooke and Doug trying to soothe her
It killed her
It ate her
Shh
Shhh
It's okay, it's okay
Sean
Listen
Listen to me, Sean
The kid looks up dully
Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me or  will kick your ass, do you hear me
Listen to Andy, Sean
We're throwing a rope and you better catch it, hear
Sean nods
The other Kids are encouraged
The rope is thrown -- it misses
(to Bob) Keep an eye out for that fish
Bob climbs to a vantage point, watching
Throw it
Sean
Catch it
Another miss
In his haste to help, Larry overreaches to fish the trailing rope out of the water, and falls headlong into the sea
Shrieks of fright from the others
Larry
He scrambles out, hardly wet, that's how fast he's moving
Finally -- Patrick takes the crucial throw, and the rope practically knocks Sean off his perch, but he clutches and holds it
As Andy carefully calls instructions, Sean secures the rope and the others carefully, carefully begin to pull him in
- as they pull
The slippery rope is undoing itself
With the kids reaching out hands, sticks, rope, anything to pull the little one to safety
The ocean swells rise and fall with hidden menace
--  Hands gripping rope
--  The knot, pulling apart
--  Anguished faces, concentrating, as Patrick, Lucy, Larry, and Andy struggle to bring him in
Success
He's pulled to safety
They lash his little hull as tight as they can to the rest of the floating wreckage
Bob sees something
Cable Junction's ahead
Can we make it
don't know
' looking over the wreckage to Cable Junction, now much closer
Beyond it, miles of empty Atlantic
It's off to one side, and unless they can slow down or alter course, they will miss it
(to Jackie) You okay
She's not
Shaking, silent, eyes glazed
(alone) Dear Jesus, Holy Mary, Mother of God, help us, please
(her lips move inaudibly) (to Doug) Keep her warm
(to Jackie) Jackie
Baby
Can someone help me rig a jury rudder
We might steer this
Andy joins him, and they try to make a sweep or a rudder out of whatever wreckage they can use
By 7:46, when the tide turns around, we'll be twenty miles out
More, with this wind
Shut up
can't stop thinking
(praying aloud) God, please help us, Merciful Father, in Christ's name, we beg you, help us, please, Dear God, save us, help us, please, God, help
: '   - He is rounding a sand bar off the lighthouse when he looks ahead and sees the bright sails of some of the survivors' boats
Thank Christ
He puts the helm over and heads for them
: - Polo's sloop is beating back towards the harbor when the police launch bears down, Brody leaning on the air horn
The Kids signal and wave
Over here
Yo
'm coming alongside
The launch slows clumsily
Timmy gets a line around a cleat, and pulls them fast
Mike
Is that you
Pop
'm sorry
It's okay
What happened
shark hit us out there
Mike got knocked over
Brody goes for his radio, to report in, to call for help
passed out, but 'm okay
At least you're safe
What about the others
The three boys look at each other
Jesus, don't freeze on me
What about the others
(tears in his eyes) Sean's still out there
What
He stops in his tracks, radio forgotten
heartsick
Mike goes on, He wanted to come
It was okay, wasn't it
It was okay before
The others are ratted together
Drifting
Which way
With the current
Towards Cable Junction
Brody jerks the mooring line holding them together, freeing it
He starts for his controls, obsessed
Dad, 'm sorry
Stay here
Don't go anywhere
Just stay here
He indicates the lighthouse, then guns his engine
Stay at the lighthouse
He roars off, headed towards Cable Junction
: -  - approaching Cable Junction the rafted boats are drifting towards the Cable Junction
Larry, Patrick and Andy are working on improvised tiller lines to a jury rudder made out of wreckage
Lucy has another line out to a sea anchor, trying to slow their drift
Bring her to port a little
That's it -- steady
think we're changing course a little
Can we land on it
If we can get to it
We're going to die
(comforting her) It's all right, we're okay
More to port
It's all the way over
Shit
Are we going to go on the island
You bet, kiddo
(the realist) don't know
What the hell, we're steering for it
The wind drift is lateral
What's that mean
Sideways -- For every yard we go this way, we also slide sideways this way
His hands illustrate the predicament
But we had it
We were headed right for it
Shit
Shit, shit, shit
We're going to miss it
The others are silent
It's true
Larry, Bob and Brooke try to alter its course by padding
Don't
Stop paddling
But the island
The Shark
They freeze, as the raft grinds against something
The inverted mast of one of the wrecked boats is snagged on the rocks on the bottom
as it slows, then stops, hung up from below
What is it
We're hung up on something
Maybe the bottom
(hysteria) It's that thing
It's going to kill us now
We're going to die
Shut up
Just shut Up
Leave her alone
Lighten up, man
It's bad enough without her freaking out
She's hysterical, goddamn it
Don't yell at her
The group dissolves in bitter exchanges
No one is rational
Lucy is the first to notice something
Wait a minute
Listen
Listen
The group subsides, only Jackie is left, keening to herself
There's a distant sound of a boat's engine
Bob spots it first, and waves
The others follow his pointing finger
Over there
Coming this way
- ' under full power, heading straight for them, go crazy, waving, yelling, screaming, "Over here
" "Help
" "Hey
" It's Dad
in the boat, coming up on the Kids fast
He throttles back, his bow wave almost swamping them as he slides past
Easy, easy -- you'll swamp us
Back down
Brody fumbles with the throttle, manages to hold his boat steady between the raft and Cable Junction island
We're hung up here
Snagged
Can you get us a line
Brody finds a coil of line, makes one end fast, then throws it to the Kids on the raft
They catch it, and tie it off to a cleat
We got it
Go ahead, slow
Be careful
Brody throttles forward, the police boat shudders under the strain as the line goes taut
where the rope is tied off to a cleat
The wood groans, screws pop -- Whoa
Too late
The cleat rips out, Brody's boat leaps forward
Come around again
' as he repositions; he's now between the raft and the island, preparing to throw his line
He heaves, the Kids grab, they have it, they tie off again, Hang on, hang on -- we got it
You're on
Dad
Help
Brody starts to pull the raft again, when: surfaces, and moves purposefully towards the gap that separates the police boat from the raft
It lunges at Brody as it passes the launch; the fin hits the taut rescue line, snapping it
' Brody recoils in horror as the beast rushes past, he spins the wheel and hits the throttle, sending the launch hard to port
Out of control, it runs up on the rocks of Cable Junction
as it tips up on the rocks
Brody falls, equipment and loose material breaks loose and falls
- held by only a few screws, it pulls out of its mount and shatters on the deck
lifting high out of the water, the screw turning in air
Their horrified reactions
picks himself up, and staggers to the rail, sees his predicament
Hang on
Dad
Dad
'm okay, baby, 'm here
It's okay
He climbs over the rail, onto the slippery wet rocks, trying to get to where he can help
The Shark patrols the gap, waiting
Can you get a line to me
the Kids find some line
Andy coils, and throws
- Brady catches the Kids' line
He heaves on it with all his might
Nothing
Jackie is hysterical, some of the other Kids are screaming
The Shark's fin catches the taut line, it slides up and over, Brody and the Kids are nearly pulled into the water
The raft doesn't budge
the mast bends under the strain, but holds the raft stuck fast
- He sees the winch and hooks on his launch, and makes the towline fast to the steel winch cable; puts it in neutral
The Kids haul their line, trying to bring the steel cable to them
The shark rams their raft, impatient now
Screams and scrambling as they let go their line and try to avoid the beast
Brooke huddles with Sean, Jackie cowers alone
Larry is lashing his big buck knife to a pole, an improvised weapon
Unattended, it drops into the water
Get the cable in
Pull
They do, but now the winch cable is snagged under the surface
It comes taut, but doesn't budge
Brody watches, helpless for the moment
Son of a bitch is stuck
climbs back onto the boat, starts the winch engine, trying to pull the cable free
on the offensive now, takes an outrigger pontoon, biting it, tearing it off the raft, shaking everything
the Kids react to this fresh attack
It's killing us
don't want to die
Mommy
The winch smokes and stalls, the weight it's pulling almost too much
Come on, you bastard, come on, pull
Pull
bursts apart from the center as the Shark lunges up through the canvas trampoline of the Sizzler
The Kids, screaming, fall into the water as the attack forces the fragile structure into pieces
Only Sean, Brooke, and Jackie are left on the remaining segment
watching the destruction, seeing Sean practically alone in the water
Sean
Hang on
He looks around the deck frantically, spots a rubber emergency inflatable in its case
He wrestles it off its brackets, and breaks the seals urgently
He hits the auto-inflate
'    - Alone on the raft, Brooke and Jackie helpless nearby, the other Kids flailing in the water
The huge bulk of the Shark, fin cutting the water as it closes in on the confusion
While Brody inflates the rubber raft and throws it in the water, the Kids scramble for safety, swimming for their lives
Each one is sure this moment is going to be his last
Get on the rocks
Swim for it
Andy is pulling himself towards the boat, scrambling up on the exposed wooden hull
Lucy
Look out
As she looks over her shoulder and screams -- the monster is sliding past her, intent on Bob
The rough hide scrapes her, tearing her clothes, leaving raw bleeding lacerations on her torso
'm bleeding
Larry and Patrick help her towards the rocks
Help
He's clinging to a piece of broken boat; the Shark lunges at him
- grinding, smoking, hauling something out of the water -- heavy, slimy, dripping metal cable, the main powerline from the mainland
paddling the raft towards Sean with desperate strokes, heedless of the danger around him
Hang on
Just hang on
He fights to see in the gathering gloom
Suddenly, a strange glare snaps on, then more illumination, in a series of escalating clicks
Silhouetted against the evening sky
Automatic timers are turning on navigation and worklights, illuminating the barren rocks and rusty steel with their glare -- throwing dark shadows, putting the surrounding water into black limbo by their contract
straining to see what's going on
Looking for his son
(
) Dad
Help
Daddy
'm coming
He looks around desperately, sees Andy safe on the launch
Andy
Use the lights
The lights
soaked, clinging to the rail of the launch, hearing Brody, fumbling in the cabin, turning on worklights, the boat throwing erratic shafts of powerful light from its many lamps and searchlights
Andy grabs one and sweeps the water with it, trying to help
Where are you
Chief
His light pokes and sweeps through the gloom
He hears the horrendous sounds of wood and metal breaking, as the raft pounds to pieces on the rocks
He is blinded by the sweeping searchlight, the confusion of terror-stricken teen-agers screaming
It's the middle of The Inferno
'    - Sean, standing up, reaching out to him, the Shark hitting his fragile perch, Sean tumbling backwards, towards what seems to be certain death
(
) Sean
as he hurls his paddle at the Shark, anything to get even, to distract it
You bastard
He looks around him wildly, searching for a weapon, finding a steel boathook
He screams at the unfeeling Shark
Come here, you son-of-a-bitch
The huge gray hulk obligingly turns towards this new irritation
Brody bangs on the raft, yelling, creating a commotion
lunges at the raft, Brody sliding desperately away, smashing at the snout with his steel, the tail fin bashing him as it passes
Brody is drifting close to the cable, drawn heavy and wet cut of the water
He reaches up to it
dangling his feet in the water, holding onto the cable, seeing it, inspired with a lunatic idea
Over here
You bastard
Over here turns, bleeding from a superficial cut on its snout, its scar glistening wet and terrible
It heads for Brody
Possessed, yelling at the top of his lungs
Come and get me
Come and get me
Attacking
Missing Brody, who hauls himself up out of the way in life-or-death spasm
The great jaws close, fastening onto the thick cable
Shaking it
The cable resists for a moment, then splits, layers or insulation and armor crack open, the jaws clamp harder -- 20,000 tons of pressure -- then the live copper core is reached
Zap
dying
Leaping and convulsing as hundreds of thousands of volts surge through its body, grounded in the salt sea
Hot white fire shimmers like a halo, the fish smokes and stinks, sputters, and dies
watching, cowering on the rubber raft to which he fell when the shark hit the cable
It's strangely silent
The lights on Cable Junction flicker and die as circuit breakers shut down the mains, protecting the line
Only the boat's worklights provide light now
Sean
No answer
Water lapping at the rocks, some Kids sobbing quietly
Brody listlessly paddles towards the wreckage of the raft, expecting the worst
Timmy's Doughdish, where we last saw Sean
There's a scrabbling from inside, and Sean appears, soaked, from under the seat where he'd fallen
Dad
Brody moves toward him, holds out his arms, taking Sean onto his raft
They paddle back towards the rocks
with the Kids clinging like drowned rats to the rocks; they're wet, scared, exhausted, but safe
Sean hugs his daddy as they step onto land
They made me go with them
Sure they did
He kisses the damp forehead
