and  shake hands
Well Brad,  guess we made it huh
Well  don't think there was any doubt about that - You and Betty have been almost inseparable ever since you sat in on Dr Scott's refresher lectures
Tell you the truth Brad, she was the only reason  came in the first place
Science was never one of my favourite subjects but  sure with Dr Scott could have made it today
Yes, Janet and  are both fond of him
We drove over to see him last vacation
It's a shame his new job took him away from Denton

It swings around revealing the
He is in his smoking jacket
He speaks directly to us
would like if  may to take you on a strange journey
He crosses to the bookshelf
He selects a dossier
We see the title: "The Denton Affair"
He returns to his desk and places it on a bookstand
He puts on his reading glasses
It seemed a fairly ordinary night when Brad Majors and his fiancee Janet Weiss (two young ordinary healthy kids) left Denton that late November evening to visit Dr Everett Scott, ex
tutor and now friend of both of them
It's true there were dark storm clouds, heavy, black and pendulous, toward which they were driving
It's true also that the spare tyre they were carrying was badly in need of some air
But they being normal kids and on a night out, well they were not going to let a storm spoil the events of their evening
On a night out
He closes the book marking the place
Thunder is heard distantly on the sound track
It was a night out they were going to remember for a very long time
Lighting cracks on the sound track
19 windscreen wiper working under strain
Torrential rain on the windscreen
concentrating on visibility
eating chocolates and listening to the car radio playing an Orson Welles serial - The Shadow
motorcycle roars past them
Gosh
That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us
They certainly take their lives in their hands
What with the weather and all
Yes, Janet
Life's pretty cheap to that type
takes another stick of gum
Offers  some
He declines
The car slows to a halt
What's the matter Brad, darling
Headlights on sign reading: " "
think we took the wrong fork a few miles back
Oh dear
But then where did the motorcyclists come from
Hmmm
Well,  guess we will have to turn back
20 Car reverses
puts his foot on the accelerator
The wheel skids and explodes
21 What was that bang
We must have a blow-out
Oh
Pause 22 bolt of lighting strikes a tree
23 You'd better sit here and keep warm while  go for help
But where will you go
We're in the middle of nowhere
Didn't we pass a castle back down the road a few miles
Maybe they have a telephone  might use
He unbuckles his seatbelt
'm coming with you
There's no point both of us getting wet
'm coming with you
(she unbuckles her seatbelt) Besides, darling, the owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come back
laughs
thunderclap
commences and she alights from the car and follows him, newspaper over her head
24 :		"    " The rain pours off the newspaper down 's face
She walks along, catching up with
She sing plaintively
In the velvet darkness Of the blackest night Burning bright
We see the two of them -  striding ahead,  nearly catching up with him
Behind them on the side of the road, sparse trees and rock formations
There's a guiding star No matter what or who you are
They have passed a row of trees
rock formation in the shape of a castle is silhouetted against the sky
It has a flag flying from the turret
Lightning strikes
glow of light appears in a window
It illuminates a path to the castle
and  turn
The castle is in the distance between the two of them
& There's a light The castle looms in the distance
Over at the Frankenstein place
stares hard
There's a light
The castle looms closer
Burning in the fireplace
(looks to Brad) There's a light, a light In the darkness of everybody's life Taking  by the hand,  moves off the roadway towards the house
can see the flag fly can see the rain Just the same There has got to be Something better here For you and me
Lighting strikes
jumps towards
& There's a light
The castle seems to move forward
Burning in the fireplace
There's a light
25 motorcycle convoy roars by revealing a hidden road to the castle
light In the darkness of everybody's life
The convoy drives up and disappears into a secret entrance in the rock
26 We see a cell-like window near a massive lighted window
tortured face appears squinting into the darkness
The darkness must go Down the river of nights dreaming Flow morphia slow Let the sun and light come streaming Into my life
27 Lightning strikes
28 moves to the lighted window where his hunchbacked shape becomes a giant shadow
Into my life
29 and  start moving down the driveway
& There's a light
30 Shadow turns in the window
Over at the Frankenstein place
31 and  approach the gateway to the castle
& There's a light
32 The shadow slowly covers the whole window
Burning in the fireplace
33 There's a light, a light
and  are at the gate
There is a rusted sign
& In the darkness of everybody's life
bolt of lighting illuminates the sign which reads:
- 34 The  is in his armchair
He leans forward with some urgency
And so it seemed that fortune had smiled on Brad and Janet and that they had found the assistance that their plight required - or had they
Thunderclap
35 rings the doorbell
It makes a strange sound
Oh, Brad
Let's go back
'm cold and 'm frightened
Just a moment, Janet
They may have a telephone
The door opens
Throbbing music is heard in the background as if there is a party going on in the distance
The figure we have seen at the window emerges
He is a hunch-backed servant,
Hello
Uh - oh - Hi
My name is Brad Majors
And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss
- ah - wondered if you could help us
Our car has broken down about two miles up the road
Do you have a phone we might use
You're wet
Yes, the rain has been very heavy
Yes
Yes
36 bolt of lighting illuminates a row of vehicles parked by the castle
37 sees them and reacts with surprise
realises  has seen them
think you had better both come inside
You're too kind
They enter apprehensively
38 leads them down a stairway and beckons them to follow
The  has become louder
(sotto voce) Oh Brad, 'm frightened
What kind of place is this
(sotto voce) Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos
39 They arrive at a hallway at the bottom of the stairs
Another servant, , who bears a striking physical resemblance to   is vacuuming the stairs
This way
steps over the vacuum lead
Are you - giving a party
No
You've arrived on a rather special night
It's one of the master's affairs
Oh, lucky him
He's lucky
and  look at , surprised by her voice
You're lucky, 'm lucky, we're all lucky
40	:		"  " and  are rather unnerved by this outburst from the domestic
They look back to
He is now standing by a set of mirrors reflecting to infinity
It's astounding Time is fleeting Madness takes its toll But listen closely Not for very much longer 've got to keep control
gives   a strange signal
starts to dance in an extraordinary fashion
remember doing the Time Warp
and  are amazed
Drinking those moments when The blackness would hit me
half closes her eyes in pleasure
clings to
And the void would be calling
opens a set of double doors marked
41 and  find themselves on a balcony of a huge black and silver ballroom
At the furthest end is a throne-like chair and, surrounding it, a theatre proscenium
In the body of the room are
They are the people  and  passed on the road
They are the Transylvanian Secret Agents - assembled on this special occasion from all over the earth
It is the Annual Transylvanian Convention - announced by an official banner suspended over the Ballroom
They are all dressed in strange but elegant evening wear
They are a distorted version of the  from the Denton wedding
party spirit prevails, they throw their arms out in a plea to   on the balcony
Let's do the Time Warp again
falls into 's arms
is ecstatic
revives
(repeating action) Let's do the Time Warp again
faints again
42 The  moves from his desk to the wall behind him
He pulls down a chart with illustrated dance steps on it
He gestures to the appropriate section of the diagram with the pointer
It's just a jump to the left
43 The  leap to the left in one giant step
(dancing) And a step to the right - right - right - right - right
44 points to next step on the chart
With your hands on your hips
45 have hands on hips
You bring your knees in tight
But it's the pelvic thrust
The rows of  open out with pelvic thrusts
(Cont) They really drive you insane
We see them from the balcony and they open out in formation
(Cont) Let's do the Time Warp again
revives
The  re-form
Let's do the Time Warp again
and  make a run out the door
46 They collide with  who has blocked off the corridor with her vacuum
She sings with menace, waving the cleaner hose dangerously
It's so dreamy Oh, fantasy free me So you can't see me No not at all
and  look at each other in alarm
In another dimension
(she forces them back towards balcony) With voyeuristic intention
blushes
Well secluded  see all With a bit of a mind flip You're into the time slip Nothing will ever seem the same
They are back at the balcony
You're spaced out on sensation
They are at the edge of the balcony
Like you're under sedation
They force  and  into the Ballroom proper
The  turn on them
Let's do the Time Warp again
and  are completely dismayed
Let's do the Time Warp again
, a young girl, is the household groupie
She sings with the band at the end of the Ballroom
47 Well  was walking down the street Just having a think When a snake of a guy Gave me an evil wink
Well it shook me up It took me by surprise He had a pick-up truck And the devil's eyes He stared at me And  felt a change Time meant nothing Never would again
48 Let's do the Time Warp again
and  are reeling
Let's do the Time Warp again
49 He has now become rather involved in the dance and is standing on the blotter on the top of his desk
It's just a jump to the left
He jumps to the left
50 And then a step to the right
The  take one
51 The  dancing on the desk
With your hands on your hips
52 You bring your knees in tight
But it's the pelvic thrust
between their legs
That really drives you insane
Let's do the Time Warp again
Everyone reverses direction
Let's do the Time Warp again
All the  fall to the floor like flies exhausted
53
/ Oh
Say something
Say
Do any of you guys know the Madison
No one laughs
turn nasty
53A
/ and  retreat to the hall
Behind them a lift slowly descends bearing a figure in a black cloak and a diamante stiletto heel - beating time to a rhythm the band has started playing
Brad, please lets get out of here
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet
But it seems so unhealthy here
It's just a
a party Janet
Well  want to leave
We can't go anywhere until  get to a phone
Then ask the butler - or someone
Let's wait awhile Janet
We don't want to interfere with their celebrations
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad
They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own
-  They may do some more folk dancing
Brad - 'm cold, 'm wet, and plain scared
'm here, there's nothing to worry about
rise, staring mesmerised at the lift
sees the shoe, looks up at the face of its owner
faints
-------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------- 54
/ The figure turns and throws open lift cage door
As camera zooms in to the death mask above them the film changes from black and white to colour
However the only colour in evidence is the red lipstick on the mouth of their host
:		" " How do you do
see you've met my faithful handyman
He's a little brought down - Because when you knocked He thought you were the candyman

Don't judge a book by its cover 'm not much of a man By the light of day But by night 'm one hell of a lover

lets the cloak fall onto the throne, which reveals his transvestite attire
The  scream with delight
'm just a sweet Transvestite From Transexual Transylvania
He slowly moves back to  and , doing leg kicks
Let me show you around, maybe play you a sound You look like you're both pretty groovie
He circles them and forces them into the Ballroom
Or if you want something visual not too abysmal We could take in an old Steve Reeves movie
clumsily attempts to circle around
meanwhile ignores him and greets his other guests
'm glad we caught you at home Ah - could we use your phone We're both in a bit of a hurry
joins
Right
We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry
turns on them
You got caught with a flat Well how about that Well babies don't you panic By the light of the night It'll seem alright 'll get you a satanic mechanic
turns his back on  and  and splitting the ranks of his , departs for the other end of the Ballroom
Streamers fall
'm just a sweet transvestite From Transexual Transylvania
From the throne he gestures towards  and  rather slowly over the next verse
Why dont'cha stay for the night & "night" Or maybe a bite & "bite" could show you my favourite obsession 've been making a man With blonde hair and a tan And he's good for relieving my tension
We view from  as the  surround him adoringly
'm just a sweet transvestite From Transexual Transylvania
storms down the Ballroom to the lift
'm just a sweet transvestite
"Sweet Transvestite" From Transexual Transylvania
"Transylvania" 55 So come up to the Lab

The  applaud ecstatically
and  close in on  and
They remove  and 's wet clothes
moves down from the bandstand and crosses to  and
She witnesses the undressing
Slowly, slowly
It's too nice a job to rush
The  moan softly as each piece of clothing is removed
and  stand shivering in their underwear
There is complete silence
The  and  are motionless
and  are the total object of their attention
68
/ Oh Brad
(confidentially) It's alright Janet, we'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right
He turns to  who has been staring at his underpants
Ah, hi
My name is Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss
You are
You are very lucky to be invited up to Frank's laboratory
Some people would give their right arm for the privilege
has opened the cage doors to the lift
The  rush for positions
People like you maybe 've seen it
escorts them to the lift
throws two  to the floor to make room for them
He slams the cage door
The two discarded  cry and claw at the cage door as the lift moves off under  's control
and  are squashed, arms by their side
They stare straight ahead
(to Magenta) It he - Frank - is he your husband
General amusement
The Master is not yet married
Nor do  think he ever will be
We are simply his servants
Oh
The lift grinds to a halt
They have arrived at the laboratory
69 The laboratory is somewhere between a student observation operating theatre and a Greek gymnasium
It is pink-tiled throughout, facing the lift entrance is a circular area containing a  on pedestals which though screened at this stage will be revealed to contain the body of submerged in chemicals, the wall to one side contains a raised dias area for the , and facing one end of the tank, the operational controls, monitor and a giant refrigerator
chandelier hangs above the tank
On the podium in front of Frank's chambers there is a stand microphone
Near the podium are some weights
Behind the tank is a vaulting horse
These are wrapped in sellophane - Rocky's presents
The  are waiting as the lift arrives
, now in surgeon's outfit stands in the middle of the room gets out of the lift first, with a glass of champagne which he hands to
Magenta, Columbia, go and assist Riff Raff
As he speaks her name each one steps forward out of the lift
They cross to   behind the tank
will entertain
ah
&  step out of the lift
'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice
Weiss
Weiss
(Taking Janet's hand to kiss) Encante
How nice
(he circles them) And what charming underclothes you both have
(He takes two dust coats from Riff Raff and hands them to Brad)
But here, put these on
They'll make you feel less vulnerable
&  cross to the podium
(continues) It's not often we receive visitors here
Let alone offer them hospitality
(Moving towards Frank) Hospitality
All we wanted to do was use your telephone
reasonable request which you have chosen to ignore
(Hurring after Brad) Don't be ungrateful Brad
(Stepping closer to Frank) Ungrateful
The room falls silent
All eyes are on , waiting for his reaction
smile breaks on his face
How forceful you are Brad
Such a perfect specimen of manhood
So dominant
&  laugh
You must be awfully proud of him Janet
Well, yes  am
oh and ah appreciatively,  laughs, a little embarassed
Do you have any tattoos Brad
Certainly not
Oh well
How about you
(He laughs) has approached behind , looming over his shoulder
Everything is in readiness, Master
We merely await your word
drinks his champagne then hands   the empty glass goes to the control panel and  to the podium Tonight
One, one, one
Can you hear me at the back
Tonight, my unconventional conventionists
,  and  laugh politely
Tonight you are to witness a breakthrough in biochemical research
There is a gasp from ,  and
And paradise is to be mine
and everybody applaud
claps too, but  indicates that she shouldn't
It was strange the way it happened
One of those quirks of fate really
One of those moments when you seem irredeemably lost:  you panic; you're trapped; your back's against the wall
There's no way out, and then suddenly, you get a break
(He cracks the bones in his hand)  All the pieces seem to fit into place
What a sucker you'r been
What a fool
The answer was there all the time
It took a small accident to make it happen
An accident
&  step forward one each side of him
&  (softly) An accident
That's how  discovered the secret
That elusive ingredient, that spark that is the breath of life
applaud
(Moving to tank) You see, Brad and Janet, you are fortunate
For tonight is the night that my beautiful creature is destined to be born
Everybody applauds
then pulls the cover from the tank is at the control panel
70 The tank is revealed
There is something inside it is immersed in clear fluid
The  are astonished
Throw open the switches on the sonic oscillator
flicks the switch to activate the oscilloscopes in the panel
And step up the reactor power input three more points
presses a button three times then begins to unwind a wheel
watches excitedly from behind the tank as the chandelier is lowered
It spurts different coloured liquids into the tank
The liquids bubble and change colour
The thing inside begins to look like a human form
Brad
It's alright Janet
The liquids drain away
The form begins to move
climbs the ladder at one end of the tank,   the other
sits up, raises his arms, finally stands upright with both arms outstretched
removes the bandage from 's head
looks at then at
With a gasp he leaps for the chandelier above
At the same time   is down the ladder making for the handle
He winds up the chandelier and
71 :
with only his head unbandaged, is hanging on to the chandelier which   is winding upwards
The Sword of Damocles is Hanging over my head
runs down the ladder and kicks   who starts to lower the chandelier
climbs up the other steps to meet his creation coming down
&  cross to the tank
And 've got the feeling Someone's going to be Cutting the thread
Oh, woe is me
My life is a misery
Oh, can't you see That 'm at the start Of a pretty big downer
As  gets level with him,  lunges for him but lands inside the tank
because
simultaneously abandons the chandelier, lands between  and who now each have a pair of scissors with which they will snip his arm and leg bandages

Riff, Magenta & Columbia) That ain't no crime
And left from my dreaming Was a feeling Of un-nameable dread
That ain't no crime My high is low
'm dressed up With no place to go
And all  know Is 'm at the start Of a pretty big downer
, in the tank behind , puts his arms round 's neck
spins away

No no no, no no

He strikes a pose
During the last sequence,  climbs out of the tank onto  ' shoulders and purses , but they fall

Rocky needed peace of mind
He didn't know He was doing just fine
He was the product Of another time
And as for feeling down - Well that's not a crime

74 picks himself up
is sitting at the top of the ladder above him, with his perfect limbs near Frank's face
Well
That's no way to behave on your first day out
looks hurt
But as you're such an exceptional beauty 'm prepared to forgive
crosses behind  to stand next to   behind the tank

The end of the  turns into Mendelssohn's wedding march and leads  to his bridal chamber
The  throw confetti
and  look at each other in amazement
80 There are some people who say that life is an illusion, and that reality is simply a figment of our imaginations
If this is so, then Brad and Janet are quite safe
However, the sudden departure of their host and his creation (into the seclusion of his sombre bridal suite) had left them feeling both apprehensive and uneasy
feeling which grew as the other guests 'departed' and 'they' were shown to their separate rooms

Oh, Brad, come in, darling

Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what if
It's alright Janet
Everything's going to be alright
Oh,  hope so my darling

You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad
Nothing
Why, do you think  should
You tricked me -  wouldn't have - 've never - never know
But it wasn't all bad was it
In fact,  think you found it quite pleasurable
Mmmmm so soft, so sensual
He re-commences making love to her
Oh - Oh - no - stop -  mean help

Ssssh
Brad's probably asleep by now
Do you want him to see you like this
Like this - like how
It's your fault
You're to blame

His eyes are full of hate

He releases the chains

Janet's probably asleep by now
Do you want her to see you like this
Like this

It's your fault - you're to blame
thought it was the real thing
Oh come on, Brad, admit it
It was enjoyable, wasn't it
There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure

Janet needn't know,  won't tell her
You promise you won't tell

"If" and "Only", two small words
Words which kept repeating themselves again and again in Janet's thoughts
But it was too late to go back now
It was as if she were riding a giant tidal wave
It would be folly to fight against it
Her only chance would be to ride it out - adapt - and perhaps also to survive

She becomes aware of the sound of someone crying inside
She pulls the cloth back to reveal  lying in the tank - exhausted and bleeding

You returned here for one thing - security

The wheelchair hits the floor
Don't play games, Dr Scott
You know very well what Brad Majors's doing here
It was part of your plan was it not that he, and his female, should check the layout for you
Well, unfortunately for you all there's to be a change of plans

But it was to be in a situation which none of them could have possibly foreseen
And just a few hours after announcing their engagement, Brad and Janet had both tasted forbidden fruit
This in itself was proof that their host was a man of little morals - and some persuasion
What further indignities were they to be subjected to
And what of the sonic transducer and floor show that had been spoken of
What indeed
From what had gone before, it was clear that this was to be no picnic

My my my my 'm a wild and an untamed thing
'm a bee with a deadly sting
Get a hit and your mind goes ping
Your heart'll thump and your blood will sing
So let the party and the sounds rock on
Gonna shake it till the life has gone
Rose tint my world Keep me safe from my trouble and pain
dives into the pool
During the chorus the whole group are diving in and out of the pool in a frenetic water ballet
'm a wild and an untamed thing 'm a bee with a deadly sting
Get a hit and your mind goes ping Your heart'll thump and your blood will sing
They emerge from the pool and form a kick line
So let the part and the sounds rock on Gonna shake it till the life has gone
Rose tint my world Keep me safe from my trouble and pain

They applaud slowly
has a ray gun
The characters on stage freeze - terrified
It's a showdown across the ballroom
Frank
Furter It's all over Your mission is a failure

Your life style's too extreme

You are now my prisoner
The  scramble for the safety of the wings
We return to Transylvania (he turns to Magenta) Prepare the transit beam

During the song he adjusts footlight controls to give him what effects he requires
The others help  out by singing from the wings

closes silver curtains
On the day  went away
Goodbye Was all  had to say Now Want to come again and stay Oh my, my, Smile and that will mean  may He kicks on cloud projection
Blue skies appear
've seen blue skies Through the tears in my eyes And  realise 'm going home 'm going home falls on his knees
Everywhere it's been the same Feeling Like 'm outside in the rain Wheeling Free to try and find a game Dealing Cards for sorrow, Cards for pain
switches on wind machine
've seen blue skies Through the tears in my eyes And  realise 'm going home 'm going home
'm going home
164 who during all this has been filing her nails, looks up at who is in an attitude of supplication
How sentimental
moves slowly to the stage
And also presumptuous of you
You see when  said "we" were to return to Transylvania,  referred only to Magenta and myself
looks appalled
The  are deeply troubled, realising that they also are not part of the "We"
You see, you are to remain here, in spirit anyway
He produces a ray gun
Great Heavens, that's a laser
Yes, Dr Scott
laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter
You mean you're going to kill him
What's his crime
You saw what became of Eddie
Society must be protected
Exactly, Dr Scott
Now Frank
Furter, your time has come
Say goodbye to all this and hello to oblivion
raises himself to his full height
Do your worse - inferior one
As   pulls the trigger,  dashes between them
She is killed instantly
fires again at
takes a leap fro the rope on the curtain
The entire proscenium crashes under the weight
And  is crushed to death among the velvet and glittered facia
breaks down completely
Although he despised , he was all he had in the world
He rushes to the body and cradles it in his arms
can stand no more
He fires a blast of laser beam at  who starts climbing the stairway towards the fox skyline
fires again and again
With the body of  in his arms,  beats on his chest and lets out a wild sound like a giant beast of the jungle
fires a sustained beam
climbs to the top of the Fox sculpture
fires again and again
They crash to their deaths
Good God
Yes
You've killed them
has found the entire sequence of events quite distasteful
thought you liked them
They liked you
They didn't like me
They never liked me
(he tries a calming hand) You did right
decision had to be made
(the big sell-out) You're  by me
Dr Scott 'm sorry about your nephew
Yes, well perhaps it was for the best
You must leave now Dr Scott while it's still possible
We are about to beam the entire house back to the planet of transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania
Go now
The  flee down the ballroom and out the door
We see the laughing figures of   and  making a special sign to each other
165 We see  and  fleeing with   following behind
165A and 's laughter has subsided
Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet
Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains
To take that step to the right
But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane
And our World will do the Time Warp again
165B There is a huge explosion
166 We see the entire castle surrounded by a giant beam of light and then vanish into space
During the explosion sequence the film reverts optically to black and white
167 :		"-" , , and  's bodies are scattered on three sides surrounding a crater where the castle once was
The scene is arid and deserted
There are remnants of  's wheelchair, 's coffin and broken objects from the laboratory
, tattered and bleeding, lifts himself up
've done a lot God knows 've tried To find the truth 've even lied But all  know is down inside
drags himself to his knees
& 'm bleeding
(revives) And super heroes Come to feast To taste the flesh Not yet deceased And al  know Is still the beast Is feeding
The three of them stand shakily on the perimeter of the crater
All that is left is dust and sand and wind and the sun
The   from face to face in a circular movement getting faster and faster as the trio sing a chorale of hopelessness
168 The  has spun into a blur but focusses on a spinning globe of the earth on the 's desk
The  puts his hand on the globe, stopping it
He is standing over his lectern reading from his book like a preacher in a pulpit
And crawling on the planet's face Some insects called the human race Lost in time, and lost in space And meaning
He turns and goes to the door of the study
He switches off the light
Meaning
He leaves the study, shutting the door
It's almost dark in the study
Only a sinister glow inside the globe of the earth remains

> As scripted up to;  What further indignities were they to be subjected to
Then please add:	And what of the floor show that had been spoken of
In an empty house
In the middle of the night
What diabolical plan had seized Frank's crazed imagination
What indeed
From what had gone before it was clear that this was to be no picnic

Oh no my baby - don't be upset - it was a mercy killing
He had a certain naive charm - but no muscle
