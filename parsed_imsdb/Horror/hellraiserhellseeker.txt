: Written by Carl Dupre 10/27/2000 - looks out the passenger window as the trees go whizzing past
She's attractive, late twenties, warmly sophisticated
Something makes her smile
She turns to the driver and thinks real hard as she says this
Okay
Cubic root of nine thousand two hundred and sixty one
is her husband, late twenties as well
God gave him brains and beauty
He has used them both prodigiously
Twenty one
Why do we have to do this now Kirsty
Shut up and play darling
Your turn
Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four
Uh
eighty two
Eighty four
Kirsty takes a calculator out of her purse and double checks the math
You win
Okay pull over
(looking at his watch) But
thought
(laughing) If what 've heard is true this could be the last time for a long long time
Besides we've got a whole seven minutes before the next one
Clock's ticking
Tick-tock
Trevor waits a moment to see if she's kidding
(through clenched teeth) () 2
: Then pulls over to the side of the road
Kirsty reaches over, quickly unzips his pants immediately goes down on Trevor He reacts accordingly
little pleasure, utter shock
' (from  ) Honey what's wrong
Kirsty rises   once again
What isn't wrong
Why are you doing this anyway
(self-conscious) 'm
'm doing a very special thing here
And you can't even
respond
Sorry honey the present situation isn't exactly fodder for an erection
Shouldn't we be getting to the hospital
Kirsty
For the first time   her big pregnant belly sticking out
She looks at Trevor innocently
was going to keep breathing you know
You think 'm an amateur or something
Trevor stuffs himself back in his pants, puts the car in gear and presses the accelerator
Just concentrate on the task at hand please
Listen to me
You should be giving  this lecture
You've been cheating on me haven't you
Yes  had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction
Roughly two thirds of married men who cheat start during the eighth month of their wives' first pregnancy
() 3
: (2) would never cheat on you
Not while you're pregnant now you know that
(features tightening) Okay
uh oh here comes another one
Share the pain Kirsty
She takes Trevor's hand and squeezes as hard as she can : '  sitting between them
Do we need this vision of the solved rubics cube
- The car is approaching a bridge
- Trevor takes his hand off the wheel to look at his watch
(') One fifteen
(in dire pain) Oh God
Trevor,  think my water just broke
Trevor grabs the wheel again
Kirsty
(') Oh my God
It's coming out
What
Trevor looks at her, trying to stay calm
Okay Kirsty don't panic
Just keep breathing
'
Put the seat back and hold on to something
Were almost there
() 4
: Kristy's hand moves down the along side the seat between the door and she plunges back with the seat
She looks at Trevor wide eyed
Shes about to give birth in a Chevrolet
It hurts
(breathing heavily) oh my God, Oh my God
Trevor, It's coming out
This isn't happening
Kristy starts to convulse with pain
She begins to tremble and her arms flail about in an attempt to ease her discomfort
She grabs Trevors arm for support
Honey, take it easy
Your gonna be alright
Kristy becomes more violent, kicking her legs up onto the dashboard
She starts grabbing Trevors arm a little more violently, causing Trevors to weave a bit on the road as he recoils
- The car lunges to the side of the road and weaves a bit in the gravel
Up ahead a bridge approaches
- Trevor regains control of the car
(cont'd) Kristy
Take it easy
everythings gonna be alright
Com'on, start the breathing, with me
come on
One, two-three, and blow
Trevor starts the lamanns method alone, as Kristy appears to have passed out from the pain
She has her head leaned away from him and is limp in the passengers seat
(cont'd) Krist
Honey
Kristy
Kristy doesn't answer
Trevors puts his arm on her and shakes her
She doesn't react
() 5
: (cont'd) Kristy
Honey wake up
Trevors attention is now on his unconscious wife rather than the two lane road which stretches across the bridge
(cont'd) Honey, wake up
Please wake up
And with that Kristy's does exactly that
She lunges toward him in a violent spasm and scares the shit out of him (and us) which causes Trevor to now completely lose control of the car
/
- The rest is a blur
Trevor loses control of the steering wheel
Kirsty Their car skids from one side of the bridge to the other-careening toward the guardrail-
The car is plummeting toward the river below
Trevor and Kirsty brace themselves
The car hits the surface
,  - Trevor flounders through a disoriented flurry of bubbles
He breaks the surface and gasps for air
Getting his bearings he see the car bobbing on the surface, the current is separating him from his wife
Treading water, he looks out at the car and there she is trapped inside
Kirsty Still belted to her seat
Her eyes are wide with desperation, breath quickening, sinking fast
Kristy pounds the window with her hands, trying to get out
She's trapped
Apparently giving in, she presses a hand against the windshield just before the car disappears under the surface
- Trevor paddles hard to the shore
Exhausted, he crawls onto the shore underneath the bridge they just jumped
Trevor stands trying to process what just happened in the last fifteen seconds
He screams out for his wife, and to what has just happened
() 6
: Kristy
Kristy
Trevor drops to his knee's in distress
(cont'd) Oh my God, Kristy
Please Kristy
(frantically) 'm so sorry, Kristy
He hears something from above and looks up
chunk of the bashed-up guardrail from the bridge has just snapped off and is sailing right down toward him- - Trevor's eyes blink open, darting left and right
He is on a bed, his head bandaged
the room, walking up to Trevor's bed
Where is she
Where's Kirsty
The Nurse grabs Trevor's right arm and straps it to the side of the bed
She isn't exactly one of God's gentler creatures
Hey, what are you- She moves to Trevor's legs, strapping them down as well, then his other arm
By now    the room, features obscured by surgical masks
The Nurse fastens a clamp around Trevor's head, attaches it to the bed
Trevor is completely discombobulated
The surgeons gather behind Trevor's bed
'  as he struggles to see what's happening back there but it's useless
() 7
: He cannot move a muscle
He hears a sickening  noise and his eyes bulge in horror
as the doctors calmly lift Trevor's freshly sawed cranium from his head exposing his brain
The  - a large unshaven man with magnifying lens alreaday in place make his eyes enormous and his face grotesquely distorted
He walks up, presented with a tray full of evenly arranged pins
He cranks up the magnification of his lenes which make his eyes appear even larger
Though no one speaks his name his name tag reads Dr
Barker
What are you people doing
The Chief Surgeon takes one of the pins and gently pushes into a Trevor's frontal lobe
(') What's happening to-
Trevor's eyes glaze over and his jaw relaxes
The chief surgeon speaks in an english accent
As you can see  just accessed the speech center, temporarily shutting down all verbal ability
As the Chief Surgeon continues he takes several more pins off the tray
(') The goal is find the exact point in the brain where moral decisions are made, the place where right and wrong is distinguished
In exploring this Morality Center  will most likely be triggering memories, disrupting the unconscious
Our patient may experience some distress during the proceedings but they are not due to pain
It is merely our patient- recalling his past
Chief Surgeon slips another pin into Trevors exposed brain
(cont'd) As he was thrown into the lake, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown
The Chief Surgeon voice lowers and his eyes turn black
The eye magification no at a hideous level, showing jet black eyes
() 8
: (2) (cont'd) Where you will be tormented day and night for ever and ever
(rev
20:10) Trevor looks at the frowning nurse who is watching over him
Chief Surgeon sticks a needle into another spot on Trevor's brain
' : The nurse is suddenly a pale gargoyle with blackened eyes
Trevor opens his mouth to scream and- -     ,    is now standing before him
She is bathed in a haze of white light
Well
What do say Trevor
Que pasa
Trevor relaxes
His bindings are gone
The gargoyle nurse is gone
The surgeons are gone
And his brain is sitting safely within his inviolated skull, upon which now sit a few electrodes
The bandage is no longer there
But from his pain wracked expression we know the pain in his head is still very real
He reaches for his head, makes sure its all intact
Where do  start
How's the old noggin
Any change in the intensity
She touches him gently
(cont'd) Can you describe the pains
Trevor looks up
The angelic woman smiles back at him
She's in scrubs, a stethoscope dangling from her neck
Trevor winces
'm not sure
How about a jackhammer in the Occipital lobe
She picks up a pad and scribbles something on it
Trevor notices she's wearing a nameplate
Dr
() 9
: (3) Are you a dream too
Still hallucinating as well
Hmm
What just happened to me anyway
It looked like a dream but it felt like reality
It's the morphine Trevor
You're on so much of it, you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open
Terevors quickly recalls the accident
Fearing the worst
Where's Kirsty
Where's my wife
(confused) Your wife
walks in
He gives Trevor an icy look, then looks at Trevor's chart
(to Ambrose) Still a little hazy
He's still in pain too, even after the morphine
recommend we admit him
At least for another day
(leaning in, sotto) He just asked for his wife
Well  can't find any abnormalities think we're ready for discharge
But, Dr
Ambrose- (looking up at Trevor) think it's time to ween you off these painkillers too
Wouldn't want you to develop a dependency to them
You might do things like come to the hospital for no reason other than to get a fix, wouldn't you
() 10
: (4) Ambrose gives Trevor a fatherly smile then , not even looking at Allison
Allison watches him go, then turns back to Trevor
then smiles perkily
Well looks like you're going home
Hope you brought your bus pass
- Trevor starts nodding out
The bus is practically empty a boy and a girl sit across from Trevor sits further back, knitting something
causes Trevor to wake again up, wincing at the sound
As the church passes the  becomes louder and louder
Trevor hears  and looks up at the children
The girl and her brother seem to be play-fighting over a toy they hold between them
Trevor looks at the toy getting stretched this way and that
Do you kids mind keeping it down
The creepy old woman speaks up
Aww let them be
They're only kids
Trevor notices what the Old Woman is knitting is a baby's bootie
As the children continue to laugh at him Trevor stares at the bootie tears welling up
'
- Trevor lives in a dingy place, one step up from poverty- level
Funny thing is this used to be a nicer place
We see remnants of a feminine touch long since past
Dirty dishes sit in the sink
cockroach skitters across the kitchenette
Trevor sits at his  playing an extremely violent videogame
We're talking heads getting blown off, bodies exploding, limbs being severed
As the end ends a   chuckles from the
The screen flashes
Trevor takes a swig of beer and sits back in the easy chair looking at something atop the
picture of Kirsty
11
'  - Trevor looks through an old photo album
Pictures of him and Kirsty
Some pictures of him
lot of pictures of Kirsty
Smiles, smiles, smiles
He stops at one close up of them mugging at a camera they've pointed on themselves
All we see is their faces, the rest is dark and blurry, except for one thing
small shadowy object Kirsty is holding
- Dressed in a button down shirt and tie, Trevor walks up to the pale utilitarian box-like structure
,  - It is a maze of cubicles iced by harsh fluorescence
It is a mill of data research, where the  of fingers on computer keypads never ends
'  - no thanks to Trevor, who has already resumed his head-in- hands position at his desk
He rubs his eyes, seemingly blinded by the screen staring back at him
Trevor's age rolls up on his office chair beside Trevor, banging into the desk
Trevor's co-worker and cubicle mate
Trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today
Hey Bret
Christ, my head feels like a split coconut
Dude there is a track on the carpet between here and the bathroom
It was made by your ass
You've been dragging it all fucking week
What happened to you yesterday
Bret eyes Trevor suspiciously
Then smiling
(cont'd) You never came back after lunch
Did you get a piece o'ass, you bastard
() 12
: Give me a break
checked back into the hospital- amongst other things
Hospital
You haven't been to the hospital since uh
Since what
(getting uncomfortable) Look never mind
Just get some numbers going- any numbers at all will due
The hills have eyes remember
Bret casually gestures to a surveillance camera overhead that sweeps across the room like a prison spotlight
(') 'm just looking out for ya
Bret slides back over to his work station
Trevor puts his hands on the computer keys and starts to type
jolt of pain rips through his cranium forcing him to stop
Bret stops typing and breathes an exasperated
Sixty five point three percent of all headaches are due to low sugar levels in the bloodstream Trevor
light bulb seems to go off over Trevor's head
- Inside the narrow room blasted in fluorescent light, Trevor eyes a vending machine, examining its wares
He peruses the sundry sugary snacks, looking for just the right fix
It's so quiet in here we can almost hear his head pounding in pain
He shuts his eyes
couple of the fluorescent bulbs over his head wink out and the rest flicker weakly
When Trevor opens his eyes again he notices the room has gotten considerably darker
He looks up at the weakening lights and grunts in disgust
() 13
: The light is just dim enough now so that he can't see what's in the vending machine
He goes right up to the glass and peers into the machine, using his hand as a visor
This strain on his eyes intensifies his headache
It's still pretty murky inside the glass case
Trevor squints and just when he thinks he can read a wrapper on
what is it
candy bar
- suddenly presses against the glass from inside the machine
Trevor jolts backwards
The hand is gone
But in the reflection of the glass Trevor notices someone has been standing behind him
He whirls around- -and is face to face with our worst nightmare:
It's too late
Pinhead lashes out at Trevor striking his face with a clawed hand the rips his face clean off
The lights are back up as Trevor slams against the machine and grabs his face
It's still there
Where Pinhead was standing is   who just slapped him
She is attractive and studious
Her sensible business attire can't hide a very curvaceous body
This is Trevor's supervisor
Jesus what the hell was that
It's like you saw a ghost or something
Trevor slowly peers into the vending machine
Nope
Nobody here but your average every-day candy bars
Trevor is dumbfounded
(') (angrily) Come on speak up, Gooding, 'm trying to run a business here
can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks
Sorry  just kind of
spaced for a second there
() 14
: (2) Well don't let it happen again
Or  may have to spank you
Gwen grins sinfully at Trevor and pushes his shoulders back against the vending machine
Before he realizes it, she's kissing him real hard
He gently ducks out from under her, freeing himself
(') Get back here, junior bean counter
This is your supervisor speaking
Please, Gwen
You're- you're all over me
How do you think you got this job, cock
(cozying up to him) Mmm
'm still tingling all over from our little midnight swim
Trevor looks constipated
He has no recollection of this
Gwen strokes his face
(') What's wrong, Trev
Nothing, look
Gwen  really like you- And it shows
Least it did last night at the quarry
In a big way
Trevor gently pushes her off him again
Please you're going way too fast for me here
' giving  a speeding ticket
Mr
Mario Andretti himself
Gwen, my wife's dead
Oh  see
That again
Trevor
realize it must be hard
But Christ how long does it take someone to move on
() 15
: (3) That was cold
No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months
That's cold
This goes through Trevor like a shot
Here we go- Dolly in zoom out
In Close up of Trevor we
of Kirsty's hand pounding on the windshield, the car sinking into the lake, a quick cut of a dark figure with a bright ring, and shots of two naked bodies slamming against each other in climax course through Trevor's mind
Finally, over the images of erotica we hear Gwens voice as one of the characters
(cont'd) Yeah, Trevor thats it
Thats it
And back in the real world, Trevor is now locking lips with a very ready Gwen
His hand is up her skirt
He stops abruptly and pulls back
'm sorry Gwen
don't know what's happening to me
(zipping up)  think it's the painkillers, really
Gwen rolls her eyes
She re-adjusts her self and now getting a little pissy
She's heard this one before
(') They mess with my head
Yesterday gets blacked out and a memory from months ago is played out in vivid technicolor
Like the accident just happened you know
Gwen softens up
Trevor is so earnest, so vulnerable
Why don't you let me take you out tonight
promise to make it the most memorable night of your life
She kisses him
He braces himself
She grabs his butt, then goes for the door
() 16
: (4) (') Pick you up round seven
And Gooding
Get some fucking work done
'  - Trevor relentlessly crunches numbers at his computer
He pauses a moment to stretch and rubs his eyes
from his computer announces he has an  -
Trevor goes to the mailbox on his screen, clicks
Up comes a jpeg slideshow
Each picture is of Gwen dressed in a piece of sexy lingerie
The caption underneath reads Looking around his cubicle, he then takes another look at the jpeg
Trevor stands up in the cubicle and we see him peer the outer office looking for Gwen
He sits back down
Embarrassed Trevor closes the memo at least for now
'
Startleing him(and us)
He picks it up
(into phone) You got Trevor
' (from phone) Trevor hi this is Detective Lange from homicide
It's about your wife
Push in on to a bewildered Trevor
' ,  - It is a dank crumbling room
place where sunlight is not welcome
, a handsome graying gentleman who's plagued with a chronic case of post nasal drip, sits at his desk
Trevor sits across from him
Behind Trevor is another empty desk
As Lange speaks he  wetly every so often
(to Trevor) Thanks for coming down Mr
Gooding
Has your head healed okay by now
Where's my wife
Okay then
Here's the scoop
() 17
: Lange takes out nasal drops and squeezes some in each nostril as he speaks
(') (cont'd) We still haven't been able to locate your the body in that river
And missing persons turned up some evidence that qualified the disappearance as foul play
What evidence
For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either
Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally
It should all in the report
told you guys everything
She was giving birth in the fucking car
She grabbed the wheel and  lost control
did read that, yes
(flipping through the report) What hospital were you going to
mean the Lodovico Street Bridge isn't exactly on the way to Mercy General
Trevor looks numb, unable to answer
Lange poker faced, keeps looking through the reoport
(') (cont'd) Listen we really are at a stalemate here until we find the body itself
Is there any way you did not tell missing persons everything that happened just before that accident
Why wouldn't  tell you everything
(impatiently) Look, 've been fully cooperative
(quick to add) to my recollection
() 18
: (2) 'm sorry Mr
Gooding,  meant no disrespect
'm just doing my job here, mean between your head injury and the fact that you are on very strong pain medication, you might not be remembering a few details about the crash which might help us here
Lange takes a deep hit of the nasal spray
(cont'd) What you're recalling could be a fabrication you've made up about it
Do you follow
'  as he wrestles with this notion
: '  - Kirsty's eyes are closed
She is motionless
Trevor tries to look at her while watching the road at the same time
Kirsty
Jesus, wake up
This time she doesn't wake up
- The car fishtails
Trevor loses control and the car skids from one side of the bridge to the other- careening toward the guardrail-
The car is plummeting toward the river below
The car hits the surface
- Trevor flounders through a disoriented flurry of bubbles
He swims up to the passenger door and tries the handle
It won't give
Unable to breathe Trevor finally swims up
- He breaks the surface and crawls onto the shore
He looks out at the car to where she should be trapped inside
() 19
: Trevors eyes are wide with desperation, breath quickening, The car is sinking fast
He looks at the car and calls out, but there is no Kristy insight
The car disappears under the surface
Trevor hears something from above and looks up
chunk of the bashed-up guardrail is sailing right down toward him- '  - Mr
Gooding
You still in there
Trevor blinks and looks around him
Lange is sitting just where they were when he saw him last
Only now there's a very wary look on his face
Whoa
Uhh
Yes detective, sorry
Just trying to recollect, you know
Lange nods
(') Okay
From what  remember now, maybe my wife was thrown from the car when it hit the water
Maybe she wasn't trapped inside
Lange checks the report again
He believes Trevor
or does he
' That's a start
'll tell the people trawling the river maybe it makes a difference maybe not
Thanks for your help Trevor
If we have any more questions you'll get a call from myself or my partner Detective Givens
Lange stands up and backs up awkwardly to a file behind his desk
Trevor stares at him suspiciously
You guys know something  don't
() 20
: All things considered we probably know a lot less than you do
Have a good afternoon, Mr
Gooding
Trevor exits, both men maintain eye contact as the door closes between him
- The bus pulls up to the curb
Trevor climbs out and starts walking down the empty street
As soon as the bus pulls away, the only sound heard is Trevor's footsteps
: We see Trevor's back from a slight distance
Someone is following him
Sensing this, Trevor looks behind him
Nothing but an empty sidewalk
Trevor hurries his pace, almost there at his apartment building
He glances behind him again
Nope, nobody there
then suddenly- -   passes under a streetlight on the opposite side of the street
Trevor turns a corner no picking up the pace a little
The   follows, it picks up it's pace as well
Trevors walks an d approaches a small alley way
Should he take this home
enraged Pitbull nearly rips his nose off as it Barks and lunges to the end of a heavy chain leash
Trevor (and us) about piss our pant's
The dog continues barking, Trevor regains his composure
Suddenly the dogs attention moves toward the direction of the
Amazingly, it stops barking and actually cowers back into the shadows
Spooked, Trevor rushes up to: '
- He hurries up to his apartment building and lets himself in
'
- He looks out on the street
The figure is walking up the building opposite his
It's features are shrouded in shadow, but it is definitely staring at Trevor, who slams the apartment door behind him
He peers out at the street from inside the front hall
The figure is gone
() 21
: Trevors looks around the apartment
He opens the fridge, it lights up the darkened room
He grabs one of the three items sitting on the wire racks
About to twist off the cap off a cold beer, when a light out his window urges him to investigate
He draws the curtain open and
: Staring back at him, from a dimly lit window in the apartment building across the street, is the that followed Trevor home
The man's face is shrouded in shadows but Trevor can see he's holding something bundled up in a blanket
The light in the window winks out, rendering it dark again
Trevor can almost still see the figure somewhere in the darkness still gazing at him
Trevor looks a little sick all of a sudden, like he can't breathe
begins to peel
Trevor opens his mouth to draw in a breath but instead spits out a massive amount of water
Trevor falls to the ground, arms and legs thrashing, heaving up mouthfuls of water
Trevor is drowning
In the puddles of water, we see bits of debris: leaves, pebbles, etc
Finally, a hideous eel-like creature's head pokes out of Trevor's gaping mouth- it escapes and slithers across the floor, up the window sill and out into the night
-the ringing bell stops abruptly and he takes in a humongous lungful of sweet oxygen
He then notices he is completely dry
Stunned, he looks about him
Trevor is now laying on the easychair, nursing a beer
His videogame is flashing
Whoa
The -
of his doorbell startles him
Trevor gets the door to find a striking young   on the other side
Black hair, lipstick, fingernails
She smiles (too brightly for someone with such somber appointments) then summarily lifts her shirt to just below her breasts for Trevor
() 22
: (2) Here it is, what do you think
Trevor looks down at her stomach, the lower half of which contains tattoos which just break the surface of her jeans
At its center is a navel pierced with a studded black pearl, which Gothic Woman then plays with
Trevor looks a little confused
(') saw it on the counter, looked at the name and the rest is history
It's like, named after me
Well
(getting uncomfortable) Oh
Uh
it's beautiful
'm sorry, 've just been having a weird day
totally understand
Listen  don't know if you're into incense but,  bought some, it's called Witching Hour
To inhale it is to love it
mean the stuff'll clear your head big time
Come on over, 'll burn some for you
If you can't sleep tonight
She jabs a thumb down the hall behind her
(') knock on my door, 'm a total insomniac
No, thanks 've got a
a date tonight- His eyes roaming her, he finally finds a tattoo on her shoulder reading: (') -Tawny
(eyebrows raised) Whew
You bounce right back don't you
What do you mean
Didn't your like
whole life get totalled last week
() 23
: (3) Last week
The car accident
Any of this ringing a bell
Trevor eyes her nervously then: It's not that kind of date
Hey even if it is more power to ya
(awkwardly) Alrighty then
Have a good time
Tawny ambles off to her apartment
Trevor closes the door and leans against it
He slides down the door and covers his face with his hands
Another headache coming on
'
- Trevor paces in his living room
Looks at watch
Then the door
Still no sign of Gwen
'
- Trevor rummages through a closet
Reaching up to a shelf above him, he tugs at a big cardboard box and pulls
The entire box comes crashing down and out spill about fifty tapes, all hand-labeled:  & , then the date
He puts one in the , hits play
It's his wedding video
Trevor watches the festivity of the wedding   , he smiles for the first time
The wedding portion of the tape ends and a not-so-clean edit takes us into the honeymoon
: '
- Trevor holds the camera on Kristy who is under the covers in a generic hotel room
She looks into camera as Trevor adjusts focus and squares up the frame
Well Trevor
It's been one year
Three hundred sixty five days
() 24
: ( ) Eight thousand seven hundred sixty hours
Five hundred twenty five thousand
Kirsty watches Trevor roam the room
She very comfortable on camera
How does feel to be Mr
Kirsty Hughes for a whole year
( ) In a word
Lucrative
The best business decision if you ever made 'll bet
( ) Enjoyable too
The merger never even felt work for one second
You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day
( ) What
Never to put you in my will
( ) Really
Why
Because you'd be staying with me for me and not because you'd get rich if  died for some reason
But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan (prvb 21:30) They share a moment
Kristy stares at him quietly through the camera
() 25
: (2) (') And besides,  thought, to hell with it
it's okay if you only married me for my money
( ) Really, why's that
only married you for your body
They laugh
The camera now looks away from Kristy and into Trevors suitcase
Trevors pulls out a wrapped present small tightly wrappped, perfectly square gift
(') What are you doing
The camera now back on Kristy
And the present comes up into frame
( ) Happy Anniversary, Mrs
Gooding
For me
Trevor
How romantic
Come here, you
The camera begins to wobble as Trevor climbs onto the bed
Its lands sideways, and we see sheets and covers rustling, accompanied by the sound of giggling and kissing
The tape ends
'
- Trevor watches this
Any of this ringing a bell
Trevor gets up and pops the tape out
He slowly walks toward the door
He opens it to find a pitch dark hallway
Hello
Who's out there
suddenly comes out of the darkness clamping her mouth onto his and examining his tonsils with her tongue
() 26
: Sorry 'm late dear
Trevor looks like he'd be more turned on sitting bare-assed on an autopsy table
Gwen you scared the living shit out of me
She pushes him toward the chair and sits him in it
You are turning into an old fuddy duddy
Shoe
Gwen puts one foot on his chest
(') Come on don't make me beat you
Trevor pulls the shoe off
(') Other shoe
Trevor does the same for the other leg
(') Good boy
(looking around) Where's is it
What
Our little toy
You usually have it up and running by now
Do  really want to know what you're talking about
: The cable from the camera runs all the way to the  where what's happening as well
() 27
: It's intense
Gwen is on top
Gwen aggressively pulls Trevor's shirt off then goes for his belt
Trevor suddenly grabs her hands
You're kidding me
'm sorry Gwen
just can't
Gwen climbs off the chair and throws her jacket back on
You have definitely got a screw loose, Trevor
Goodbye
Stuffing her feet in her shoes, Gwen's out the door
Trevor , relieved the attack is finally over
About to turn the  off and stow away his camera
He looks at the  and freezes
shows that Gwen is still there, undressing Trevor
Only video Trevor is giving in, kissing her back, pulling her clothes off
Trevor looks at the camera
The red "record" light is flashing
Trevor turns back to the  walking closer and closer to the screen
What the hell
He waves a hand in front of the camera and his hand actually appears on the  in front of the sex image
Trevor and Gwen make love in video
Video Trevor turns to the the camera (to Trevor) and gives a menacing smile
Video Trevor looks back up at Gwen, who smiles down at him carnivorously
She licks her lips
There's one thing  should have told you right from the beginning Trevor
Video Trevor doesn't see a knife she manages to slip out of her purse
() 28
: (2) (') like it pretty rough
To Trevor's shock Gwen suddenly drags the knife right across his throat
Blood shoots up at Gwen's grinning face
Blood pours out of Trevor's mouth and down his chest
Trevor, having just seen himself get murdered, shouts: - No
Allison stands above him Bic razor in her gloved hand
The bottom half of Trevor's face is covered with shaving cream
Sorry  thought you were going to stay under longer
His face is clean shaven, a little shaving cream remains around his chin
He now has several electrodes attached to his cranium
They're connected to an  which
The noise bothers Trevor
His eyes dart this way and that
He focuses on the Bic razor
What's happening to me
What are you doing
You came in for your
You fell asleep and well,  took the liberty of
'm sorry
You looked like a wreck Trevor
Trevor seems to like the attention
just had the most vivid dream
was sure  was dying
Well you can relax now you are quite alive
And as long as you're awake, chin up
Trevor puts his chin up and Allison continues shaving his neck
Trevor studies her face
() 29
: (') Well
What do you say Trevor
Que pasa
(groggily) Let me see
Oh yeah
My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder
'm not sure if 'm dreaming or
(interupting) That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor
Listen,  don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse
There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life
Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time
You might see things a litlle differently from now on
Your insight is enlightening
No wisdom, no insight, no plan
Allison gives him a wink, disarming Trevor
My wife said that exact same sentence to me the day we got married
She even winked too
Allison smiles and puts her hand on his
Do you use this wife thing to hit on all the interns
(smiling) No
just you
Allison wipes his face clean with a towel
There
Just like a baby's butt
Allison gets up, grabs a clipboard starts filling out a report
Trevor stares at her
() 30
: (2) Allison
Why can't remember what happened to my wife
Is it something 'm on that's
that's making me forget
Easy there Trevor
You need to relax
No  need to remember
Look whatever it is take me off it
can handle pain can't handle not knowing
You need to get better first Trevor
Way better
(scribbling in the chart) It's okay to miss somebody
It's okay to still love someone after they're gone
But you've got to quit blaming yourself okay
Okay
Allison looks up and notices Trevor's body has slackened, his eyes empty
She drops the clipboard and starts snapping her fingers over his eyes
Trevor
He is unconscious
sounds from one of the machines behind her as blood begins to leak out of Trevor's ear
Allison jumps up and hits call button above Trevor's bed
(') She yanks Trevor's johnnie down, wheels a defribulator over to his dying body and grabs the paddles
(') It's okay Trevor 'm coming for you
Allison rubs the paddles together, presses the paddles against Trevor's chest and- '
- -Trevor sits bolt upright in his bed
His alarm clock is making that same  noise
() 31
: Trevor is completely disoriented
He sees a note laying next to him on the bed
It says iYou're an animal baby
you-know- who
i He finally looks at the clock
Seven forty five
Shit, 'm gonna be late
'  - Trevor is on his computer typing madly he has accessed the local newspaper
He calls up an article reading:
He looks at a newspaper picture of the bridge, which is humming with rescue activity
Trevor's head is pounding
He goes into his desk drawer and pulls out a bottle of aspirin
Trevor empties the last of the bottle's six tablets into his hand, downs them, chases them with what's left of an economy sized bottle of Mylanta
Trevor can't seem to even look at his computer screen
He hears a - and looks up
He has an instant office message waiting
Trevor clicks
The instant message reads: iIT'
i Trevor rapidly types up
iWHO
i The same message is repeated
iIT' '
'
i Trevor stands up and looks around mazelike structure of cubicles as far as he can see
All of his co-workers are slaving away on their keypads
Trevor sits back down and cancels the instant message
He ruminates for a moment
From behind Bret's fingers  on the keyboard seem to get louder, more frustrated
They finally stop and Bret stretches momentarily
Must be nice
What
Getting paid for doing shit
Bret goes back to work again, fingers  away
Come on, Bret
() 32
: Seriously man, you oughta work for the government
You've got the sense of urgency for it
Trevor himself begins to type, slowly, reluctantly
Look, 'm doing my best considering okay
Hey if the boss doesn't notice who cares right
Just slack all the live long day if you want
The boss won't notice me doing a bad job because 'm not
Even if the boss thought was slacking 'd know right away
Yeah, how's that
(smug) have my connections Really
Do tell
(smiling) Gwen
Bret freezes
He then looks at Trevor, eyes bulging
crap you not
She was all over me yesterday in the break room
And she was a total machine last night too
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night
The supervisor
Serious as a heart attack my friend think she literally fucked me brains out
() 33
: (2) (super sarcastic) Wow that's quite a feat Trevor congratulations
Must be really tough to get your brains fucked out by a
Trevor stops and looks at Bret
What are you talking about
Me
This is your sick joke man
Gwen was murdered here six months ago
The security guard found her all over her office
Her head was in the waste paper basket
Her stomach was in the filing cabinet
Her ass was on the copy machine
Trevor is speechless
(') They never found the sicko who did it
remember
Trevor still can't speak
He goes into his computer mailbox and re-opens the file he'd received from iYou Know Who
i He stifles a scream when he sees the jpegs have changed
Sure they're still of Gwen
Pieces of her swimming in puddles of her own blood
Where it once said iWork harderi it now says iPolice File
i (to himself) Jesus Christ
Trevor looks behind him to make sure Bret hasn't seen any of this
He's facing his own computer typing away
Man are you ever out of the loop
Either that or you've got the worst sense of humor this side of Jeffrey Dahmer
What is your problem anyway
Trevor quickly deletes the entire file
Finally
() 34
: (3) Honestly Bret
think  lost my mind
And now 'm finding pieces of it, like pieces of a wrecked car, scattered on the side of the road
beat
Bud you need to decompress
told you you came back to work too soon after the accident
Trevor says nothing
(') Hey you know what Trev
'm going to hook you up man
Here
Bret wheels across the cubicle on his chair and hands something to Trevor
It's an oddly designed postcard bearing some sort of voodoo mask
The font is faux-Oriental, the kind they use for Chinese take-out menus
He looks closer
It's an appointment card for an acupuncturist
Sage
(') This woman will take one look at you and know exactly what you need
'  - chart of all the puncture points on the human body is tacked to the wall
Trevor lies on the table
, a gorgeous ethereal Indian woman is at the far end, hovering over the soles of his feet, sticking pins into the appropriate places
She looks up at him slyly
These headaches you've been getting
Do they happen in conjunction with the hallucinations
Sage walks over to one of the cabinets, gathering more acupuncture needles
Trevor can't help but notice her shapely body, her feline gait
Sage throws a sultry glance over her shoulder at him, prompting him to finally answer her question
(unsure of himself) Yes, sort of
() () 35
: (cont'd) My head's been in constant pain since the
accident
And the pain increases whenever , uh
slip into another, don't know what to call them
Sage comes back to him, several needles in one hand
She looks into his eyes
Dreams
was going to say dimensions
But guess technically they are dreams
You should always listen to your subconscious
It's trying to tell you something about your waking life
Sage begins applying the needles fluidly to his upper body now
(') But  never feel like 'm sleeping
It's sort of, waking narcolepsy
'll be somewhere and then- (snapping his fingers) -it's like  was never wherever  was to begin with  was really somewhere else entirely
Sage puts the last needle in
For the first time Trevor actually feels a releief of pressure in his head
(cont'd) Ok, whatever that was
do it again
That just set me free of the worlds longest head ache
Is this making any sense
(') None whatsoever
Now just relax
Let the needles do the driving
Sage looks up at the door
(') (patting his cheek) Don't go anywhere
'll be right back
Trevor watches Sage  the office
He lies there a moment, bathing in warm sunshine
He is relaxed, pain free
() 36
: (2) Behind him, an acupuncture anatomy chart on the wall
Which begins to change its shape
It morphs (or economically changes) into
Trevor is oblivious as  approaches, doll eyes betraying no feeling whatsoever
Then, Pinhead reaches up to his head and begins pulling out one of those infamous pins
It takes a while to come out
Because it is a foot long
Once out, the needle drips with black ooze
Trevor hears a noise and believes its Sage who's reentered the room
'm thinking this might just be what needed
Pinhead speaks but in Sages voice
As he pushes on of the pins into the tip Trevors skin in his back
No matter what happens just remember
Before Trevor can react, Pinhead suddenly jabs the pin down into Trevor's back, pinning him to the table
It sears his skin
In Pinheads recognizable voice
(') We're all here for you Trevor
As Trevor reels in terror, Pinhead pulls another foot long needle from his head and thrusts this one into his neck the needle come right out the other side, nailing itself into the table
Trevor can't believe he's still alive
Pinhead pulls one more out, aims this one at Trevor's arm, and swings down
quick cuts: - Allison pokes Trevor's arm with a hypodermic
She places a reassuring hand on his chest
Machines behind her are and  like crazy
Allison looks a little worried
Shh
It's okay
Go back to sleep
Allison blurs out of focus
() 37
: then briefly comes back into focus
only now it's
- ' : Buried in the murky shadow, all that can be seen are his hands, lit by a shaft of sunlight beaming through a blinded window
ring on the man's left pinky finger glimmers eerily, almost too much
We saw this man in an earlier He's holding something
The cube
He speaks in an  and know
Divorce isn't good enough
Abandonment isn't good enough
There's only one way to do it and do it cleanly, without leaving a trace of evidence
The darkened man pushes the cube across the desk towards us
(') Open this and your problem will disappear forever
And no one will ever suspect you
word of caution though
certain side effect of the box
Pleasure
Pleasures that would redefine the parameters of sensation
Trevors picks up the cube
(') Once the cube is opened there is no turning back
Ever
drowning out the darkened man's words as we: dissolve to: '  - Trevor quietly wakes up to the sound of his alarm again
He stares at the ceiling
- Trevor pushes through the front doors and a greets him with a big smile and a business card
() 38
: Afternoon doll-face
Hey, a police detective was just here to see you
(looking at the card) Some guy named Givens
She hands the card to him batting her eyelashes
Trevor looks at the card as she checks out his package
Trevor reads the word
Uh thanks this looks a little important
Could you let the folks upstairs know 'll be late
For you bubbalicious
(winking) 'd lay across a bed of nails
Trevor walks back  and the receptionist watches him go
Another female employee walks by staring at Trevor
She looks at the receptionist and they both nod in agreement
(') You know it girl
That ass is a three- hummer baby
Mmm-mmm-mmm
'  - Same office only Trevor is sitting at the other desk across from a hawklike  who is playing with a yoyo
This is If good cop bad cop is the scheme here, he's the latter
'm sorry
still
don't understand how this is a homicide case
mean nobody was murdered here
Her body's been missing for  don't know how long now and
What did you just say
said she's been missing for- No
No you said  's been missing
What's the difference
() 39
: Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive
You seem to certain she's dead
(tearing up) saw her drowning inside the car, detective
read up on you, man
You're a smart guy aren't you
mean with numbers
Right
You could say that
Zero's a number right
As in one minus one equals zero yes
Where are you going with this
How many zeros was your wife worth
Brow furrowing, Trevor stands up
need to talk to my attorney
Now
Givens pushes his phone toward Trevor, who takes it and dials furiously
Givens remains poker-faced
Trevor dials a number
(') (into phone) Yes  need  ' office please
He says the lawyer's name like it's supposed to intimidate Givens
He couldn't care less
(') (a beat) Yeah this is Trevor Gooding  need to speak with Larry
Trevor
Kirsty Gooding's husband
(another beat) see do you know when he'll be out that meeting
Fine 'll uh
call back then
Okay you give him the message and he'll call me that's great
() 40
: (2) With that Trevor hangs up the phone and  the office
Givens
'  - Trevor types bitterly on the computer crunching numbers like a madman
don't know what pissed you off but it's nice to see you getting the job done for a change
'
- Trevor plays his videogame with venom
The cries of his kills emanate from the , building to a crescendo
Finally we hear a '  come from the
' '
Trevor flicks the  button
'
- Trevor stares at the self-taken picture of him and his wife mugging at the camera
What is it that Kirsty is holding
'
- The  is on
Trevor flips through the channels
He stops on the Nature Channel
goat is casually munching on some nuts and berries
' (from ) -at the dawning of the agrarian age goat's milk would be considered a suitable substitute for a mother's breast milk
And the sacrifice of a goat would appease an angry god and ensure a bountiful harvest
But in time the ritual would become associated with less hallowed purposes
:      , '  (') Goat's blood is said to hold supernatural properties linked to black magic
() () 41
: '  (') In conjunction with the pentangle- the five pointed star- the spilling of goat's blood is considered to be either an aphrodisiac that can be used in demonic orgies, or a means by which a high priest may summon Satan himself
of a goat with many eyes appears on the screen
'  (') (from ) The Book of Revelations speaks of the anti-Christ as the beast with many eyes
For centuries illustrators have chosen a goat to represent this beast
His eyes hurting too much to watch any more, Trevor turns the off
Out of sheer instinct he suddenly turns to look- -  : The apartment across the street is lit
is standing in the window
Trevor jumps up and rushes over to his window
He looks at that same shadowy man he saw earlier
The man's face is still obscured and is still holding something in a blanket
Squinting Trevor is able to make out what it is: The stranger pulls the baby's blanket over the baby's angelic face
Then the light in that apartment goes out abruptly
Trevor stares at the darkened window breathing heavily
Is the stranger still in there, watching Trevor in the dark
Trevor cannot tell
makes him flinch
Trevor goes to the door, opens it to find: Only now she's dressed in a skintight black rubber dress
She smiles accentuating a fresh coat of black lipstick
Hey
Can  borrow something
Uh
sure, Tawny
what
You
() 42
: (2) Tawny grabs the back of his neck, pulling him to her as she kisses him deeply
She grabs his collar and pulls him out to the hallway
- She turns around, leading Trevor through the hall like a horse
very confused horse
Tawny
What's- what are you doing
Trevor eyes her gorgeous body and decides not to resist quite so much
'  - Trevor leans against the counter, sipping at a glass of wine nervously
Right next to him, Tawny's at the stove, stirring a pot of something dark and bubbly
She looks up at him, smiling seductively
But Trevor's still a few lengths behind
You okay
'm, uh, not sure
Feeling kind of weird actually
Really
Tawny grabs Trevor's balls and he jumps away as if jolted by a cattle-prod
(') 'm kinda feeling nuts myself
've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other
(grinning) God
Sometimes you can be such an animal
Other times you are the ultimate tease
She holds up a spoonful of what she's been stirring
It looks like stew
() 43
: (') Taste this
Keeping a hand below his waist Trevor leans toward the spoon, tastes, licks his lips
Then squints
Wow
That's good
Lots of capers, huh
For starters
It's also got fennel, asparagus, olives, some more of mother nature's aphrodisiacs
Back in college, me and my roommates used to call it hard- on stew
Not a very appetizing name
Have some more
Trevor takes another sip of it
(') If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid
You must have been very proud of yourselves
It's getting hot in here
Tawny summarily unzips her rubber dress and whips it off
Trevor is speechless
Tawny's body is covered with bites and bruises
Jesus
who did that to you
Tawny
You're kidding right
Trevor shakes his head no
() 44
: (2) (') You did
God, you are funny tonight
Tawny approaches Trevor who tenses up
(') Almost like 'm with somebody else
Trevor starts looking very ill
Tawny  think 'm going to be sick
Well now there's a compliment
Trevor grabs his stomach, lurching over
He can't breath
Trevor looks up at Tawny
But it is no longer her
Tawny has changed into something else entirely
The Cenobite rips Trevor's shirt open, and we can see movement within his abdomen
Like a baby kicking
Whatever's in their shoots up expanding Trevor's chest cavity
The Cenobite pins Trevor to the wall and hovers in his face as if about to kiss him
Before Trevor can scream he is choking
The Cenobite watches with glee as something begins to move up into Trevor's throat, expanding his neck, forcing his jaws open and finally
a   pokes its head out of Trevor's mouth
The Cenobite opens its own mouth and the eel starts to crawl inside it
Meanwhile Trevor's about to pass out from asphyxiation when- - -he takes a deep grateful breath through an oxygen mask
The various pieces of monitoring equipment around him are and  like slot machines
Allison walks around the room pressing buttons that silent each machine one by one, then walks up to the bed, looking surprisingly calm
Sorry about that
There was a blockage in your oxygen hose
Won't happen again, promise
() 45
: Trevor looks relieved
Shell-shocked but relieved
'm certainly keeping you busy huh
(smiling) Too bad  hate my job
She strokes his forehead
(') Feeling better now
Trevor shakes his head
These hallucinations 'm having
think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way
Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it
If they're blocked memories
'm starting to realize the reason why blocked them out
Allison  think really
screwed everything up
Shh
Don't blame yourself Trevor
Please
miss her
miss my wife
Trevor takes her hand
Allison looks briefly around her then
climbs onto the bed with him
If you need to cry, go ahead
won't tell
Holding her hand to his face, Trevor closes his eyes, squeezing out a tear
'
start to  subtle differences about Allison's hand
It is very pale, the fingernails black
Trevor opens his eyes
46
' ,  - He is now lying on Tawny's bed, which is surrounded by unlit candles
Sunlight streams through her open window
It is her hand he is holding to his face
The rest of her is sitting under the sheet, covered head propped against the headboard
Trevor drops her hand and it falls lifelessly to the bed beside him
Breathing quickening he reaches up to the black silk sheet covering her head
He yanks it back and covers his mouth in horror
She's been bound to the bed and gagged with a white cloth that is soaked with blood
deep vertical incision has been made in her neck, collarbone to chin and her tongue is pulled through the wound so it sticks out the bottom of her jaw
And that's just for starters
When Trevor looks down he gags when he sees her ribcage has been opened like a set of French doors and her insides sitting in her lap
The coup de grace
Trevor now sees he is covered with blood
'
,  - Trevor splashes his face with cold water, trying to get his composure back
He stares at the water rushing down the drain for a moment
His breathing stabilizes He finally looks up at his reflection in the mirror
to see  staring back at him
Trevor jolts backward in shock and does a double take
It's him now, looking completely unhinged
Outside the
The answering machine picks up with a
' (from answering machine) This is Lange
We need to talk as soon as possible
It's about your little
dilemma
Give me a call
- Cleaned up now Trevor carefully makes his way back to Tawny's apartment
He tries the door
It's locked
This can't be right
He jiggles the door knob violently, then finally the door
() 47
: Suddenly- - answers the door, looking utterly pissed off
Though still in Goth mode, she's dressed much more conservatively now
Can  help you
Tawny
- you're- Trevor goes to embrace her
She shrinks back, startled
Whoa,  have serious space issues, dude
What do you want
think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on
(a look of recognition) Hey you're the guy from down the hall
Come on, quit fucking around
Listen it's about
what we did together last night
(utterly shocked) comes from somewhere behind her
Who the fuck is that
It's that guy from down the hall
He thinks we did something with him last night
Who's- who's in there with you
Tawny looks aghast
Are you cracking up or something
() 48
: (2) Suddenly an enormous  of a , wide as he is tall the doorway
He's wearing a black tee, black jeans and, Trevor can't help notice, black nail polish
on fingers and toes
Obviously Tawny's significant other
What can we do for you, chief
who are you
Brute takes a sideward step through the doorway, forcing Trevor back two steps
You know Tawny, you better know me, pal
Okay
don't want any trouble
was mistaken
'll see you later
Much
Trevor turns and hurries off
Brute turns to Tawny who shrugs and makes a twirly motion at her temple
The two go back into her apartment
'
- Trevor paces in his apartment telephone to his ear
He lets out a heavy breath and looks at his watch
Finally: (
) City police main switchboard how may direct your call
You already asked me that ten minutes ago just before you put me on hold
'm looking for defective-  mean Detective Lange
Oh he and his partner just stepped out to lunch, can -
Trevor hangs up
49
- Trevor sits at the front of the bus agitated
He folds and unfolds Detective Lange's business card in his hands like some frustrated Origami artist
The  from a passing ambulance drills his ears
The irritating sound eventually fades away but the pain in his head is still there
The  of a distant cathedral's bell makes him pause
He looks around
Toward the rear and sees a familiar old lady knitting a baby's bootie
He looks again
The bootie is bright red and dripping
blood
Trevor follows the strand of bright red wool down to their source: laying under the seat
It's insides have been ripped out
Its veins and tendons are serving as the old lady's yarn
Trevor's eyes bolt back up to the old woman
She continues sweetly, her lap speckled with goat's blood
Trevor pulls the wire and an   goes off
Trevor hurries up to the bus driver as the bus pulls over
Just open the doors 'll jump off
Not while the bus is moving, sir
Trevor clutches his head in pain and waits for the bus to stop
The doors open
He jumps off, knees nearly buckling from the pain
He looks up as the bus speeds off
the little black girl seen earlier pops up
She's holding her little doll
She pushes a clothespin into its head
Blood drips from the puncture
At the same time Trevor feels an incredible pain sear through his head
He squints at the bus again
The little girl is gone
'  - Lange is at his desk eating a sandwich
Trevor comes in angrier than a hornet in a beehive
Where's my wife Detective Lange
What the hell did you do with her
() 50
: Mr
Gooding  assure you we are doing everything within our- Why did you leave me that message
don't know what you're talking about
Trevor  his hand down on Lange's desk and gets right in his face
Trevor immediately turns around and walks
'  - is a somber but handsome young attorney
At present he at his desk poring through several books on child custody law
He makes notes on a pad beside him as he talks
(not looking up) Basically they know where your wife's body is and they're not telling you as a tactic to get you to confess
Yet neither of them has come out and told you that you're a suspect
Is that what you're trying to say
Trevor sits on the other side of the humongous office in a chair so big it practically swallows him whole
Look Larry  know you never thought too much of me
And  know this all sounds a little fucked up
little
Try unbelievably
swear these guys are like playing mindgames with me
think they got a hold of my e-mail address at work too
Larry is not buying this for a nanosecond
He trims some brown leaves off a small plant as he speaks
() 51
: Trevor barring the more outrageous aspects of your claim you are not the only widower the police have questioned when foul play is suspected
Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge
But this wasn't murder it was an accident- (concentrating on his notes) And as far as hiding a body goes
find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess
It's absolutely preposterous
Now 'm not saying  don't believe you, 'm
ambiguous
There's quite alot of money behind all this
How much do  stand to inherit if Kirsty is presumed dead
Larry sighs and walks over to his desk
He presses a button on his intercom
Rosie can you bring in the Gooding papers
' (from intercom) Right away Mr
Ellis
Uh
Ballpark would be fine Larry
In the vicinity of eight million four hundred fifty thousand
Or is it sixty- What happens if 'm convicted of Kirsty's murder
Well they'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing- () 52
: (2) Please Larry
Pretend you like me and humor me
Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and 'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city
Hello
City
Cops
It's a fucking conspiracy
Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic
The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type
You're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse
Thanks for your concern Larry
And fuck you too
Trevor gets up and heads for the door
(to Trevor's back) never thought your late wife was the sharpest knife in the drawer
But marrying you was the dumbest thing she ever did
On his way out Trevor nearly runs down Larry's  who was just coming  with a large file
Trevor's gone
- Trevor looks despondently out the window
The cab stops and Trevor hands some money to the  up front
You can go
'm going to be here a while
- Trevor gets out of the cab, which drives off leaving him on the bridge looking down at the water below
53
- Police tape  between the trees
Other than that there is no sign of an investigation
Trevor walks out of the woods on the shore, through the police tape and to the water's edge
He begins to walk the shore looking out at the still water
He scans the area where the water meets the land, trying to remember
Something on the surface few feet away catches his eye
It's a rock sticking up
No it's something else
Trevor walks right up to the water and puts his feet on a couple of large rocks breaking the surface
He bends down and looks at
He quickly reaches down, tries to pick it up
It seems to be stuck just below the surface
Trevor pulls harder and finally it gives
Trevor slowly lifts the black cube out of the water and  when he sees- -
Trevor  and lets go
And just as the cube (along with its owner)  under the surface- -   breaks the surface grabbing Trevor's wrist
As Trevor Struggles he looks up to see the dark figure standing above him holding a rock over his head
Just as he swings down towards Trevors head- smash cut to: '  - Trevor jumps scaring the hell out of Allison who has just gotten done taking his pulse
Jesus  wish you would stop doing that
Trevor looks down at himself
He's on an examination table in his normal clothes not a hospital johnnie
That's a good sign
Allison
Trevor tries to put his thoughts together
() 54
: Well Trevor
What have you got to say for yourself
Que pasa
(voice quivering) Allison we have  to talk about this medication you've got me on
'm all over it
Allison shines a penlight in his eye
(') Blink
Trevor blinks
Satisfied, Allison sits on the bed next to Trevor and takes his hand
(') Okay
What we're going to do is up the Topomax to two per day instead of one, see if that takes care of these hallucinatory seizures you've been having
The extra Topomax won't interfere with the painkillers either but
You're going to be thrilled to hear this part but we have been told by some patients it affects the memory somewhat
(weary) Really
Does it affect the memory
Allison looks concerned
Then her features soften
You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding
You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round
Some call it resilience
Others, stupidity
Allison lets a lapse in the conversation last too long
That look of concern returns as she lingers on his face
She's trying to say something
(') Everything okay Allison
() 55
: (2) (surprised at her own emotional outflow) Of course, yes
The way you just looked at me
know, my bedside manner's horrendous
Allison finishes writing a few notes, and Trevors rolls down his sleves
He's intrigued
So, 'm done
Thats it for today
All finished
Neither of them want this visit to be over
(cont'd) How bout some lunch
- The two share the end of an empty cafeteria table, eating off pastel colored trays
Think about it
In the entire world where's the most life-threatening place you could possibly be at any given moment
don't know
Beirut
New Orleans
Hint
It's not a geographical location
'm stumped
It's inside a moving car
Bull
() 56
: 've got numbers to back me up
Over the course of one year more Americans die in car accidents than did during the entire span of World War
Okay so
what's the safest place
Statistically speaking
Inside a moving bus
Allison
(') Millions of people around the world get on busses every day
When was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus
Okay Mr
Statistics 've got one for you
What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen
Please
Heart attack
That was easy street
Second most common
Skin cancer
Eighty third most common
Pitbull attacks
You just made that up
Like you're gonna check
They both chuckle, Trevor's expression gets serious
After a moment of silence
Where you two happy together
() 57
: (2) We startred off to be
She was,  guess was
just sort of
butchered up the relationship somehow
(to himself) Bad choice of words
understand,  think
Other women
Yeah
It's like  was a different guy then  am today
can't remember that guy
see these women, they think 'm someone else, and 'm not that guy anymore
'm not sure who Kristy knew
You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing
did more then that
Allison reaches accross the table for Trevors hand
quiet moment
Com'on
How bout some fresh air
- Trevor and Allison sit in a couple of chairs looking out at the other rooftops around them
Lucky for us these chairs happened to be here
Oh  knew about the chairs already
This is where the emphysema patients come to sneak cigarettes
She points to the ground at myriad butts scattered at their feet
Trevor smiles and looks at his hands
(') Don't tell me
Kirsty used to smoke
No
She just would have loved it up here
Allison when  was under
did ever talk
() 58
: Sure plenty of times
Was there anything  said that made you stop and wonder, you know, "where did that come from
" Sure plenty of times
Well
Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming
So practically everything say is going to sound strange
Did  ever talk about the accident
No
Did  ever talk about Kirsty
No
But at one point you did repeat something though
phrase
You must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over What was it
You said, "Jealousy arouses a husbands fury, and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge
" (Proverbs 6:34) Does that mean anything to you Trevor
It means  have alot more questions
Trevor stares off into the distance
Times up for today
've got to get back
() 59
: (2) Allison  and pats Trevor's knee
He melts and puts his hand on hers
She slowly takes it away and fixes her hair
(') Sorry
If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control  had
Trevor,  never date patients
understand
won't- No you don't understand
That's why 've been fighting to get you better
So you wouldn't be a patient anymore
Why didn't you tell me sooner
would have switched doctors
Just get better okay
She caresses his face then looks at her watch
(') have to get back to work
And so do you
- Trevor walks through the maze of cubicles a big smile on his face
He's actually having a good day
'  - Bret's already looking up at Trevor as he
Don't say a word, Bret
Trevor's smile disappears when he sees someone's already sitting in his chair
He's on Trevor's computer surfing the internet
(to Lange) Guess 'll leave you two alone
() 60
: (concentrating on the computer) Nice chatting with ya
Bret gets up and  as Trevor approaches Lange
(') Sorry 'm in your seat aren't
No please make yourself at home
Trevor sits in Bret's chair as Lange logs off and swivels to face Trevor
How's everything, Mr
Gooding
Can't we dispense with the games for once
thought you loved games
'll just stay out of this conversation until you come out and tell me why you've disrupted me at work
You and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident weren't you
Where is she
Where is my wife
Lange shakes his head and pulls something else out of his pocket
It's The Cube sealed in a ziploc
Trevor cannot conceal a feeling of dread
We found this curious little object not too far from the site of the accident
No prints but forensics scraped a little dark residue that was caked on one of the corners
It was blood Trevor
Matched some blood we took off your car seat too
Can you tell me anything about it
() 61
: (2) (to Lange) It looks familiar
think it was in the car
Gee you think so
Lange puts the cube back in his pocket and stands up
(') Sorry to take up your time like that Trevor
Don't work too hard
Oh, before forget
talked your neighbor out of pressing charges
What
The whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall
She wanted you arrested for harassment
told her to chill out and smoke a joint
'd look the other way as long as she did you know
Thanks
We're all here for you Trevor
Lange gets up and
Trevor satys seated, after a beat he stands up looking over his cubicle and sees staring back at him from the door
Trevors sits back down
Trevor suddenly clutches his head as if it's been killing him this whole time
He goes to his chair picks up the phone and dials
(
) (from phone) We're sorry the number you have has either been disconnected or no longer in service
If you feel you have reached this recording in error- Trevor hangs up
We can almost hear his head throbbing in pain
He turns around and there's    his desk eating a frozen yogurt
Staring at Trevor
() 62
: (3) Frogurt guy's here
They're all out chocolate vanilla swirl or 'd have gotten you one
'm sure you would have
Bret nods, tosses the frozen yogurt container out and sits down
Hey if you're not doing anything 'd like to buy you a beer after work
Be just like old times
What's the occasion
quit
Today's my last day
This hits Trevor like a ton of bricks
- The place is practically empty
Bret and Trevor play darts and work on a pitcher of beer
Country Western plays on the jukebox
've got a better offer
More time off sort of career shift, more in the engineering line of work
How much time off
As much as he feels like
Its a much more pleasurable line of work
As much as he likes
Yahtzee
Were all in this together Trev
Trevor there are people who are doing exactly what we're doing but they don't need to wear a tie, punch a clock or have some tight assed supervisor breathing down their necks
Its all about the pleasure Trevor
() 63
: So you're just packing it up just like that
Almost that fast
got a few loose ends to tie up first
Came into a shitload of money recently
've always wanted to go to take a trip
We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there
Yeah
You and who else
Someone special
Bret throws a dart with extra mph
It misses the board entirely and hits the wall
Trevor winces in pain suddenly
He touches his head and looks at his fingers
Fresh blood
Trevor in the car in the water
Thrashing about, he bleeding from his head in the flashback as well
Where's Kristy
He looks in the passenger seat
She's gone
Trevor takes the cube from the man with the ring
He fumbles with the puzzle box in the darkness
box
It starts to move
Trevor driving with Kristy, She's going down on him while he's driving
Okay pull over
(looking at his watch) But
thought
Trevor waits a moment to see if she's kidding
(through clenched teeth) The car comes to a stop
() 64
: (2) Trevor gets the goods while he watches himself in the rear view mirror
Someone approaches
Trevor zips up, pulls Kristy up out of his lap
Its a cenobite
Trevor screams and opens the door of the car to make a frantic exit
He dive out onto the pavement and looks back
All is quiet
He's alone a quiet road
He stands up and into an eerie world of slow motion
Trevor looks up the road and back to find- beautiful vision of Allison walking toward him
Walking gracefully, she approaches Trevor
Raises her hand to his face
Trevor smiles, then slowly looks back towards the car
Inside the car he see's Kristy playing with the puzzle box
Trevors calls out to her
Kristy noooo
And he makes a move toward the car, as the box comes to life
This stops Trevor in his tracks, and he looks toward Allison
Who is now
There is no reprieve for you
Not even in her
She's only a vision 'm afraid
Tervors looks dumbfounded
(cont'd) The truth hurts doesn't it
- Trevor raises his head from the bar
The beers are there but Bret is gone
Trevors stares at himself in the mirror opposite the bar
He looks like shit
He thinks hard about the flashback
Out the door he goes
65
- -Trevor's holding the phone up to his ear agitated beyond belief
He'd pace if he could
Instead he just fumes
(into phone) Yes 'm trying to reach one of your interns
Allison Dormere
She works in the emergency room there
What do you mean
just saw her today
Yes 'm sure she works there 've been in and out of that place five times in the last month
Well good day to you too asshole
-  on Trevor's hand searching through the 's in the white pages
He slams the book shut in frustration
-He's on the phone again
(') No such listing
Could you at least tell me  she has an unlisted number
What do you mean there are no Dormeres at all there have to be
(a beat, more timidly) -hello
Trevor  the phone down and touches his head again
He looks at his hand
The blood is gone
But the headache is back
Its crippling at this point
He's at his wits end
He reaches into his pocket and finds Pages card
Maybe as a last resort
Trevor presses his palm against his eye
Trevor picks up the phone
(') (into phone) Hello
(from phone) Goodbye
Kirsty
You miserable sonofabitch
66
'  - Trevor is out of breath as he walks up to the last resort
The entrance to Sage's building
The front door is locked
He presses a three digit code on the alarm box
The phone picks up
He's deperate
' Hello
Sage it's me Trevor
You've got to help me
'  - Trevor's head hits the pillow on the acupuncture table
The feeling is very distinct
It's like somebody stuck a shard of glass through my eye and it's embedded halfway into my brain
Sage nods, patient look on her face
Trevor your body has been completely healed
All the nerve endings have repaired themselves
If there is any pain in your head it's
in your head
Jeez it's getting awful crowded in there
You are physically better
It's your soul that still hurts
Sage grabs a bunch of needles from the table
(') My teacher told me once there's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it, even after you're dead
So that when you die you're trapped inside your body, watching it corrode for all eternity
Look, whatever your Marharagi, told you, forget
You've got to get this fuckin pain to stop
() 67
: It was an analogy
Your soul is locked up inside you
You need to free it Trevor
You've blocked it from the healing process
That's what we need to do now
Heal your soul
And to do that  you have to give in utterly and without any hesitation or doubt
Do you know what mean by giving in
It's about trust
Do you trust me implicitly
don't even know what's real and what isn't how can  trust anyone
You can trust me
Your wife is dead and you need to move past that
And the only way to move past something completely is to go straight through it, not around it
Surrender yourself to your wife's death
Let it chew you up and spit you back out on the other side
It's the only way you can become whole again
Sage looks Trevor dead in the eye
(') Are you ready
surrender
Trevor closes his eyes of Sage dimming the lights so that the room is nice and dark
placing needles into Trevor's body
his shoulders
his chest
his neck
his legs
his face
Trevor finally opens his eyes to find
he's completely naked on Sage's table
And she's making love to his body, which is now filled with needles
(') Wait
what the hell is this
(whispering) Surrender yourself
surrender yourself
() 68
: (2) She holds up a small chunk of ice and begins rubbing it on Trevor's chest
He catches his breath at the cold and begins to shiver
- Trevor wakes up shivering
He is in the passenger seat, head resting against a baby blanket
hand touches his
Kirsty's
Kirsty
Kirsty
It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all
Trevor looks at Kirsty
She is breathtakingly beautiful
You're alive
Yes
Now go back to sleep
You're driving the rest of the way to gramma's remember
Trevor looks in the back and for the first time sees an sleeping in a car seat behind him
(') Trevor 've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's
This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds
So, 've been thinking, what about Daisy
(looking at the baby) It's perfect
Well that was easy all of a sudden
Trevor looks back at Kirsty
Kirsty
'm glad you're alive
, piercing Trevor's ears
() 69
: Trevor winces in pain and blocks his ears from the noise
Kirsty looks at him, puzzled
He can only read her lips: "Honey what's wrong
Honey
" - Trevor's eye rivet open again
is snapping his fingers in front of them
Another paramedic is readying a hypodermic
Can you hear me
Just nod
Trevor nods
(') Do you know where you are
Ambulance
We're just gonna take some blood here
The other paramedic sticks a needle in Trevor's arm
(') You know what day it is
Trevor shakes his head
The paramedic holds up two fingers
(') Okay how many fingers am  holding up
Two
Can you follow them
Paramedic moves his hand left to right
Trevor keeps his eyes on it
(') Perfect
Hey you remember what happened back there
You mean
when the car went off the bridge
(laughing) Wow you are out of it
() () 70
: (cont'd) No it was nothing that extreme
You were riding on the bus and just collapsed onto the floor
Out cold
Remember being on a bus now
No
maybe
don't know
It's cool
Here we are
The ambulance comes to a stop
- couple of orderlies wheel Trevor into the exact room he's been coming to this whole time
The orderlies  and who should  but Dr
Ambrose
and the   who readied him for the brain surgery at the beginning
Hello 'm Dr
Ambrose
know
Have we met
've been in here before
Take no offense Trevor
see many patients a day and have an awful memory
Join the club
Ambrose holds a penlight up to each of Trevor's eyes and nods
(') Right
Trevor you just had a seizure brought on by a severe migraine
Things could be much worse
In the next few days you need to take plenty of aspirin, stay out of the sun and make sure you've had at least eight glasses of water by the time you go to bed at night
Trevor just stares at Dr
Ambrose
() 71
: (') Why don't you relax for the next couple of hours
Barring any relapses you should be able to go home after that
Where's Allison
Dr
Ambrose looks a little confused
Who's Allison
Allison Dormere
Your intern
Ambrose looks at the nurse, who shrugs, then back at Trevor
Uh we have no intern by that name here Mr
Gooding
Listen 'll be back in a few hours to check up on you meantime relax try not to move around too much
Ambrose pats Trevor's shoulder congenially and
There there Trevor
Get some sleep
Trevor tenses when the nurse smiles
(') If you need anything give myself or any of the nurses a call okay
We're- Don't tell me
eWe're all here for you Trevor' right
Go ahead say it
You know you want to
The nurse looks taken aback
What the hell are you talking about
Trevor suddenly jumps up yanking electrodes and  tubes from his body
The nurse is back to normal and very disconcerted
(') Trevor
Mr
Gooding lay back down- Trevor runs out of the woman mowing the woman down in his tracks
72
- Trevor rushes down the halls of the hospital nearly knocking down Dr
Ambrose
Hey
Trevor races as fast as his feet can carry him easily losing Dr
Ambrose
- Trevor runs down a corridor through another doorway and into another wing of the hospital entirely
He arrives at the door to Allison's office and throws it open
It's actually a janitor's closet
- Dressed in janitorial garb, Trevor bursts open the stairwell door and comes out on the roof
An   in a johnnie is sitting in one of the chairs not too far away
An oxygen tube trails from his nose to an oxygen tank at his feet
(wheezing) Okay ya caught me
He brings a cigarette to his lips and takes a long drag
(') Least let me finish will ya
Got one puff left
don't work here
Music to my ears
The old man lights a fresh cigarette with the one he's just finished
Trevor turns to go back and '  standing in the doorway
Trevor
heard you were looking for me
Is everything all right
() 73
: Allison
Am  glad to see you
(changing his tone) No
everything's not right
Not at all
Come here
Allison holds him
The old smoker turns and watches with curiosity
Allison  think  did some very, very bad things
mean very bad
Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss
Everybody does things they regret
You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system
'm telling you
You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death
Maybe  wasn't responsible for the car accident
The old man calls out to Trevor wheezily
Hey buddy
(ignoring him) but 'm starting to think  was was going to
Hey buddy
Trevor turns to the old man
What do you want
(wheezing) Who the hell are you talking to
Trevor turns and Allison is gone
Vanished into thin air
74
- Trevor sits at the front of an empty bus rubbing his head
He stares at the spot where the creepy old lady knitting the baby's bootie used to sit
He looks under the seat
There is nothing there
The   as the bus comes to a stop
This is it mister
Trevor gets up and hurries off giving the driver a cursory glance
The driver doesn't look at Trevor as he speaks
(') Have a good night now
Trevor  the bus
- Trevor steps out of the bus and faces the He ascends the steps
- Trevor sits in the booth across from the tiny screen, behind which is a    who is still in his pajamas
don't know what 'm doing here
'm not even Catholic
just had to tell somebody
It's like, ever since my wife died  don't know what 've actually done or what 've imagined
But  do know if one tenth of what's happening to me is reality
've done some really awful things in my life
Things that 've guess 've blocked out
What things do you think you've done
Wow
Let's see
So many sins so little time
For starters  was responsible for the death my wife who by the way was carrying my unborn child
That was so could collect her eight million dollar estate
think  killed several women was having mindless sex with behind her back
() () 75
: (cont'd) But  did those murders just for the hell of it
Finally
think  made some kind of deal with the devil and now he's come to collect my soul
Only he's decided to mess with my head first
How many Hail Marys do you recommend for that one father
Trevor 'm sure you killed no one
You are very distraught over your wife's death and rightfully so
You did the right thing by confessing to me here tonight
And you should keep praying for the wisdom that will set your soul at ease
That being said, you are still in a highly emotional state right now
It might do you some good to get some professional help
Confess to them the way you confessed to me
In time you'll probably find that the real killer has already been caught
Or better yet
that these murders never happened at all
But  saw these women
saw their mutilated bodies
saw their ghosts just know it happened  can feel it
All you've got is the here and the now Trevor
That's all anyone really has
Maybe this will make things easier to understand
man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly
In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man
And at the end of the day does it even matter
All these events you're describing
How can you be sure any of them really happened
But that's what  need
To be sure
to be absolutely sure
Shh
It's okay son
There is but one truth
One thing you can be absolutely sure of
And that thing is this: The priest moves closer to the screen
() 76
: (2) (') '
The Priest begins to chuckle ominously
Resisting the urge to scream Trevor bolts out of the confessional
- Trevor rushes out of the confessional begins to
Eardrums getting battered by the Trevor blocks his ears and rushes toward the exit- -coming face to face with a gargoyle blocking his path
Though he speaks softly his voice is heard easily over the bell
Still in the dark  see
Who are you
Poor Trevor
This game is over do you hear me
hear everything
And soon you will know everything
More than you ever wanted can guarantee that
But  want you to think for a minute first
Think about all you've seen
All the clues you've been given
Pinhead opens his cloak revealing the darkness within
To Trevor's shock his sucked right into this void inside Pinhead
,  - Trevor is thrust into the interior of his office building
Everyone's gone for the day
The only light is coming in from streetlights outside
Trevor races past the cubicles running out into a hallway
He looks down one end then the other
where he sees an office light is on
He cautiously approaches the office
He looks inside
77
'  - Gwen's hacked up body is strewn about the office
Her arms are atop the filing cabinet
Legs under her desk
Ass on the copier
Trevor hears someone coming
He looks down the hall to see , blinding him
It's bearer begins running toward Trevor
Trevor bolts the other direction heading for the exit
He pushes the door open and slams it behind him only he's not still outside yet
' ,  - Tawny lies on the bed, dead, tongue sticking out of her neck, ribcage violated
Trevor hears someone coming toward the bedroom can see the flashlight beam jittering as its bearer approaches
Trevor rushes toward the window, opens it and leaps out onto the fire escape
- Trevor's about to climb down the fire escape when he is bathed in the flashlight's beam from inside
Trevor looks down and sees a garbage dumpster full of trash bags below
He jumps
Trevor sails down three stories and lands in the dumpster
He climbs out and runs to the street as fast as he can
He races down the sidewalk trying to get his bearings at the same time
Hearing footsteps from behind Trevor turns to see: The Stranger in the Window not half a block behind Trevor, keeping Trevor's pace
Then
Trevor stops
And turns
The Stranger stops as well
This has never happened before
Trevor shouts down the empty street
(') His voice echoes off the darkened buildings
The Stranger stands there
Trevor begins walking toward him, blood in his eyes
The Stranger backs away
() 78
: Trevor bolts into a run and the Stranger takes off running the other way
The stranger darts into an alley
- Trevor runs into the alley, seeing no signs of the stranger
The end of the alley is pitch black
'
Trevor hears something at the end of the alley
He grabs a broken bottle out of a garbage can and heads toward the darkness
Trevor's teeth are bared now
(') '
Something  in the dark just before the razor sharp edge of a switchblade touches his left jugular
Trevor freezes
comes
(') Bret
what the fuck
Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor
Remember
couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it
Bret
What the hell is going on
We were gonna be millionaires you said
Nobody'd suspect a thing
had never even met her
No connection
Then you went and had that fucking car accident
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever
followed her Trevor
got to know her life
And what a boring one it was
Six a
m
gym, nine a
m
trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home
And wait and wait and wait
Nine o'clock get ready for bed
() () 79
: (cont'd) Ten o'clock fall asleep in front of the She did that every day  followed her
Every single day
While you were out fucking your concubines
Every day  felt more and more bad for her, man
And hated you more and more
Trevor is absolutely speechless
(') Then  find out you're having nooners with my
That was all  could take
didn't want to kill your wife anymore
wanted to kill you
Even before that little accident  decided to do it on the day we'd set aside for her
Bret presses the blade against Trevor's neck a little harder, drawing a rivulet of blood
(') But now that ain't gonna happen either fell in love with Kirsty Trevor
The day she died it was like my soul had been ripped from my body
Not just because lost someone  loved
It's because the child inside her
was mine
Bret then puts the knife to his neck
No
Bret drags the knife across his own jugulars slicing them open
Blood pours out of his smiling mouth
Then something really weird happens
Cuts begin to open up all over Bret's face and his hands
Blood pouring to the ground in buckets
Bret lifelessly falls into the pool of blood
Before he can process what's just happened, Trevor hears a  behind him and turns to see
several of those slithering sewer monsters coming toward him, surrounding him
And behind them,    walking slowly toward him
We don't need three guesses to figure out who they are
Panicking Trevor reaches down and grabs the knife out of Bret's hand and readies himself for the inevitable attack when- -the      car illuminates the alley
First Trevor notices the sewer monsters are gone
() 80
: (2) Then the figures we thought were Cenobites are actually and several police officers
Lange looks disappointed
Okay Trevor
Put the knife down
Trevor does so
rush up to Trevor and one swings his baton down just over Trevor's eye-
- Trevor's nose has been bleeding
His eye is black and blue his lip cut
Trevor looks out the window
The streets are deserted, foreign
Trevor looks at the rear view mirror
The cop staring back at him averts his gaze
Trevor thinks he sees something crawl into the cop's eye
Lange sits next to the cop, staring back at Trevor
He takes out his antihistamine and sprays some up his nose
- The doors burst open and the two cops, Lange escorts Trevor The lobby is entirely deserted
Trevor looks around
There are cups of coffee sitting on desks, jackets thrown over backs of chairs
Signs of a recently bustling workplace that has vacated
- - The cops hustle Trevor up to a counter, finger print him, sit him in a chair
One of them sits at a computer terminal
Despite being indoors both cops keep their sunglasses on
#1 Full name
Trevor Alan Gooding
#1 Age
Thirty one
(beat) () () 81
: (cont'd) Don't you guys ever take your sunglasses off
smaSH  : - The cops hurry Trevor down a dank corridor toward a line up room
Trevor sneaks a peek inside one of the rooms
:   have some strapped to some odd looking electrical contraption
told you  don't know
#1 Wrong answer
Detective#1 hits a button and a shock races through the Hapless Soul's body
Just then the other detective notices Trevor looking in and  the door shut
The trio comes to the line up room
- Trevor is shoved into the cramped booth-like room with four other strange looking  who all stare at him
Silence for a moment then: is heard and the door on the other side of room opens
#1 Single file
Trevor follows the other men
The  just ahead of Trevor turns to him
We're all here for you Trevor
#1 - Trevor walks  with the rest of the gentlemen
Hugging the nearest wall they go up a small set of stairs onto a stage
Trevor hears Lange's  overhead
' Stop and face the mirror
() 82
: The five men do as they're told, facing a large two-way mirror on the opposite wall
An awkward moment
'  (') Thank you
The door to the room opens again and Trevor turns, leading the other men back through the anteroom
- The cops hustle Trevor out into the hallway
The next door down opens and out come two more detectives and
' , the brute, looking fit to be tied
He sees Trevor and fills with rage
hope they fry your ass mutherfucker
He lunges at Trevor
It takes the detectives he's with and two more cops to keep him from pummeling Trevor
As Trevor's lead away the brute begins to sob uncontrollably
(') (to Trevor) '
#1 Got quite a fan club don't you, hotshot
- Trevor sits at a tape recorder
Lange sits across from him
For the last time
honestly don't know how any of them died
Lange stands, squirting antihistamine in his nose
He nods at Trevor and
No sooner has the door closed when it opens again and Givens walks
Givens gets right in Trevor's face
Now  want you to tell me what you remember happening- in your own words- exactly the way you told Detective Lange
But this time  want you to make one small adjustment
What's that
() 83
: Givens whirls around revealing Lange's face on the back of his head
'
Trevor thinks a moment
He is absolutely numb
He smiles a little insanely
did it
killed them all
confess
- Still handcuffed Trevor is escorted toward the detention area by the cops in the sunglasses
He's silently praying he'll wake up from this one somehow
No such luck
Trevor and the cops round a corner and there's Lange running up to them
(to the cops) Quick detour through the morgue boys
Lange leads them to a set of elevators
Morgue
That's right Trevor
The timing was impeccable wasn't it
It's been eight months two weeks and three days but we finally found the body
Just need you to it for us
Where was it
(') That's the weird part
It just magically turned up in the river less than thirty yards from where the car had landed
Like somebody put it there while we weren't looking
The elevator doors open and they get in
- It's a long ride down
Nobody speaks
Trevor looks at the cops in the sunglasses
One of them takes his pair off
His eye sockets are empty
We can see brain
() 84
: The cop cleans his shades then his mouth smiles at Trevor before he puts the sunglasses back on
Finally the doors open
Lange unlocks Trevor's handcuffs and the cops push him out the door into a dark corridor
- Trevor looks back to see Lange and the cops staring back at him
Just keep walking Trevor
You can't miss it
One of the cops waves bye-bye to him
And with that the elevator doors shut
Trevor turns around and faces the long corridor
He begins his hike towards its end where an ominous set of double doors awaits
He arrives at them and pushes them open
- As soon as the doors open fluorescent lights flicker overhead illuminating two walls of metal drawers and between them: a large slab of marble upon which rests a human form covered with a sheet
Trevor
He makes his way toward the body and stares at it
low  noise coming from a dark corner just beyond the slab distracts him
Trevor looks and freezes when he sees: laying on the floor in a pool of blood
It's still breathing
One of the goat's slatted eyes is staring at Trevor as if begging for mercy
is heard
The goat  in pain then its eye rolls up
Dead
The animal's body begins to quiver as a tiny wound on its back widens spitting out streams of blood
Trevor begins to back away as the wound stretches open, giving birth to a rising form
He rises completely from the goat, stepping out of the wound
He is red with blood for a second
Then his skin and robe absorb the blood like a sponge
Pinhead approaches Trevor blocking him from the body on the slab
() 85
: How is our little student doing
Has he learned his lesson yet
don't know who you are or what you want
just want to know what's under that sheet
Use your mind for something other than numbers dear Trevor
Think about people for a change
People other than yourself
Like the women you slept with behind your wife's back
You were always so confident you had covered your tracks
Always confident your wife actually believed your fervent denials
Part of you must have known she would find out
flaSH : '  - Gwen has Trevor on her desk riding him like a hobby horse
Rain pounds against her window
- Kirsty sits inside the car looking up at the window, eyes narrowing
(
) Jealousy arouses a spouse's fury
And no mercy will be shown when that revenge is given
'
- Rubbing the baby that's growing inside her, Kirsty sits in front of the  watching Trevor having yet another romantic rendezvous with
to Trevor in bed with yet another woman
and another
and another
: - That fatal  begins to
With each peel the walls of the morgue shakes
It's walls begin to rumble and crack
() 86
: Even a mind as narcissistic as yours must have wondered: What unspeakable acts was your wife committing behind back
- : Kirsty, Trevor's lovely wife, raising a rock above her
(to camera) Goodbye you miserable sonofabitch
And  a rock down on us
bacK : - What's under that sheet
You probably don't remember the night we played
Your first year as husband and wife
flASH : '
,  - Trevor and a very pregnant Kirsty sit on their bed, passing the cube back and forth
Trevor's the one with the magic touch
The cube begins to open in his hands
Kirsty's eyes light up as she watches
(
) It must have seemed like we were uninvited guests crashing your little celebration
the walls as shadows begin to flail in pain and panic are heard as blood begins to shower the walls of the bedroom
(
) But someone was expecting us Trevor
And everything went according to plan
baCK : 87
- We were about to come for Kirsty
When we were offered a deal
We don't usually consider bargains but this one was too good to pass up
tribute to the resourcefulness of a parent hellbent on protecting its spawn
The deal we were offered was this: three more souls in exchange for the life of the unborn child inside Kirsty
The three souls had already been picked out
Needless to say we were very impressed
The lights dim
Drawers behind Pinhead begin to open
We see Gwen's body, Tawny's, Sage's, Bonnie's
(') Two of your favorite companions, most supple and delicious as you already know
And the man you had at one time conspired to kill Kirsty with
Until you found out she was with child
smASH  : of Gwen, Tawny, and Bret being rent to pieces by the Cenobites,  in vain
- (') They were all real screamers too
We had a blast
And there was one more
You've seen many things you wished you hadn't
Many nightmares from which you never awoke
They were all clues in our little puzzle
Can you guess now Trevor
Can you guess the fifth soul chosen for us to torment in this little agreement
The lights flicker overhead, reddening with each strobe
Hundreds of those little sewer monsters come slithering out of the cracks in the walls, racing toward Trevor
He doesn't care
'
() 88
: (smiling) Welcome to the worst nightmare of them all, Trevor
Reality
Pinhead grabs the sheet and whips it back
Trevor's jaw drops in disbelief
' '
It is blue, bloated and mutilated
The corpse's skull has a massive crack in it
(') No
no
flASH : '  - Kirsty sits across from Lange, who slides the cube across the desk towards her
Open this and your problem will disappear forever
And no one will ever suspect you
- Kirsty drives
Trevor sits in the passenger seat, in the same position we saw him in during his last flashback
Only now it is clear the reason his head is resting on the baby blanket is to keep his brains from spilling out his split open skull
'  holding his
It is now covered with blood
Shhh it's okay
- The car goes off the bridge landing in the water
Kirsty's head breaks the surface
She watches the car sink into the river
baCK : Trevor stares at his own dead body in utter disbelief
The sewer monsters begin crawling up his legs
Pinhead smiles
(') () 89
: The scream  over Trevor's dead self, which seems so tranquil in contrast
on the corpse
After a beat the bells stop, as does the rumbling and the cracking
The lights brighten
Serenity
Then: ' Yes
Yes that's him
on Kirsty looking down at the corpse wiping her eyes
She looks over to the other side of the body where Trevor and Pinhead had been standing
Where now and the coroner
had been standing
The two gentlemen look at each other
Well  guess that's it then
Thank you Mrs
Gooding  realize that must have been tough
Lange escorts Kirsty to the door
They  but not before Kirsty gives her late husband a parting glance
Ambrose covers Trevor's body and looks
Alrighty
Let's get started folks
on two other  who are busying themselves collecting instrument
and
They walk over to Trevor's body and get to work
Sage sticks a needle in Trevor's arm
Collecting 40ccs of serum
Examining cranial fracture
Allison at his side, Ambrose checks the wound on Trevor's head, pauses to look inside Trevor's eyes
' : Ambrose closing the eyelid again
(') Checking oral cavity for blockage
Ambrose opens Trevor's mouth
(') And we have a winner
Ambrose pulls a long black dead lamprey out of Trevor's mouth
Looks at the slippery creature for a moment
() 90
: (2) Looks like an eel of some kind
Guess it was murder after all
Yeah all we need is the eel's motive
Allison holds out a large freezer bag, into which Ambrose dumps the dead lamprey
still don't get it
He's been missing for almost eight months
But this body hasn't been dead more than twenty four hours
Makes you wonder what he was up to between the time he disappeared and when he died
Allison walks right up to the corpse's face
Well
What do you say Trevor
Que pasa
(shivering) Allison what on earth possesses you to converse with cadavers
(looking at Trevor's corpse) It's simple, Dr
Ambrose
What if there is no afterlife
What happens when we die
Do we just stay stuck inside your bodies for eternity watching ourselves decompose
'm not following this
Well if that's the case
wouldn't you want someone to talk to you like a normal human being one last time
You two are creeping me out
And 'm a coroner
() 91
: (3) Allison fixes a stray lock of hair on Trevor's forehead
: Allison slipping a tag on Trevor's toe; sliding Trevor's body into the morgue drawer; her hand turning the lock on the drawer
(
) Adios amigo
'  - Lange sits across from Kirsty, who signs some paperwork on Lange's desk
would have come in sooner but  had an important errand to run last night
Out of town
Figures you'd find his body the minute  decide to go off somewhere
Well you made it down here that's the important part
Thank you for your patience Mrs
Gooding
She nods teary eyed
She slides the paperwork across his desk and gets up to leave
(') One last thing
When they found him he was holding something
Not to get too graphic but they had to wrench it from his hand
Lange reaches under his desk then stands revealing: inside a ziploc bag
Lange and Kirsty exchange a knowing glance
(') Figured you might want it
Of course
That was my
last anniversary present to him
token to remember him by now
Goodbye Mrs
Gooding
She takes the cube
() 92
: Thank you detective
Lange takes out his nasal sprayer as she walks
She closes the door behind her and Lange looks up at the closed door
He sticks the sprayer up his nose
- Kirsty walks toward the exit
On her way she passes a trash can
She discretely tosses the cube into it and rubs her hands together
- The birds are chirping
The sun is shining
Kirsty Gooding walks out the door and takes a breath of fresh air
She skips down the steps of the police station toward the street
She stops in the middle of the sidewalk looking both ways
up behind her
It's the  Trevor had seen out his window
He grabs her shoulder startling Kirsty
She turns to see  , shit-eating grin on his face
He's holding an eight month old
The one he was drawing
Looking for someone, Kirsty
(taking the baby) You bet  was
Kirsty plants a multitude of smothering kisses on the laughing child as   comes up behind Larry pushing a stroller
Kirsty gently places the baby in it
(') (to Nanny) Okay we're on our way
Remember her- Lactose intolerance
've stocked the fridge with Lactaid
See you in a couple of weeks
You've got my cell number right
The Nanny pushes the stroller away, nodding, waving good-bye
Larry smiles as he watches the baby go
() 93
: Daisy is getting so big
(beat) still can't believe  was her father
Kirsty smiles to herself
Counselor can we not mention  anymore
Can we just start spending  money instead
They walk slowly toward the curb
've always wanted to go to Madagascar
You mean the place with bats
They're called flying lemurs
Yeah that sounds like a real blast
They put their arms around each other
(cont'd) 've been thinking about it
This has to have been the best eight months of my life
Larry sees a cab and rushes out to hail it
(') Something out the corner of her eye scares Kirsty
She turns to see Lange standing there
You forgot something
Lange holds up the cube she tossed out
Kirsty's expression falls
But
how
Oh
Thank you
Kirsty takes the cube
() 94
: (2) (') No Mrs
Gooding
Lange turns and Kirsty's shock there's Givens' face
on the back of Lange's head
Thank
Givens smiles at her then walks away
She slowly walks toward the cab where Larry has opened the door for her
After you my dear
- Kirsty slides into the cab looking at the cube in despair
Larry slides in after her
(to the cabbie) Airport please
He grabs Kirsty's knee
She just stares at the cube
(') (cont'd) What's up
Larry looks down at the cube
It has magically risen from her palms and begun to rearrange itself in that way we've come to know and love so well
The cabbie, looking back at the sight, slowly slides the window between the driver and passenger compartments shut
Time, Larry
Time's up
- As the cab drives off into traffic we see   from within it
The cab passes a cathedral
