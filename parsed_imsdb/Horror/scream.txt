( ) by Kevin Williamson Rewrite July 31, 1995 hand reaches for it, bringing the receiver up to the face of , a young girl, no more than sixteen
friendly face with innocent eyes
Hello
' (from phone) Hello
Silence
Yes
Who is this
Who are you trying to reach
What number is this
What number are you trying to reach
don't know
think you have the wrong number
Do
It happens
Take it easy
She hangs up the phone
The    to reveal Casey in a living room, alone
She moves from the living room to the kitchen
It's a nice house
Affluent
The phone  again
Casey grabs the portable
Hello
'm sorry
guess  dialed the wrong number
So why did you dial it again
To apologize
You're forgiven
Bye now
Wait, wait, don't hang up
Casey stands in front of a sliding glass door
It's pitch black outside
What
want to talk to you for a second
They've got 900 numbers for that
Seeya
Casey hangs up
grin on her face
'  -  - big country home with a huge sprawling lawn full of big oak trees
It sits alone with no neighbors in sight
The phone  again
Popcorn sizzles in a pot on the stove
Casey covers it with a lid, reaching for the portable phone
Hello
Why don't you want to talk to me
Who is this
You tell me your name, 'll tell you mine
(shaking the popcorn) don't think so
What's that noise
Casey smiles, playing along, innocently
Popcorn
You're making popcorn
Uh-huh
only eat popcorn at the movies
'm getting ready to watch a video
Really
What
Just some scary movie
Do you like scary movies
Uh-huh
What's your favorite scary movie
He's flirting with her
Casey moves away from the stove and takes a seat at the kitchen counter, directly in front of the glass door
don't know
You have to have a favorite
Casey thinks for second
Uh
You know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters
What's yours
Guess
Uh
Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers
Yeah
Freddy Krueger
Freddy-that's right
liked that movie
It was scary
The first one was, but the rest sucked
So, you gotta boyfriend
(giggling) Why
You wanna ask me out
Maybe
Do you have a boyfriend
No
You never told me your name
Casey smiles, twirling her hair
Why do you want to know my name
Because  want to know who 'm looking at
Casey spins around like lightning facing the glass door
What did you say
want to now who 'm talking to
That's not what you said
What do you think  said
Casey  on the outside light
flood light illuminates the backyard
Her eyes survey the grounds
But it's empty
No one's there
She turns the light out
On the stove, the popcorn
have to go now
Wait
thought we were gonna go out
Nah,  don't think so
Don't hang up on me
Gotta go
Don't
Casey hangs up
She checks the glass door making sure it's locked and then moves to the stove as
She slides the popcorn from the stove, reaching for the phone
Yes
told you not to hang up on me
What do you want
To talk
Dial someone else, okay
You getting scared
No-bored
She hangs up
The phone  again
She grabs it
Listen, asshole
(deadly serious) ,  , ' Total silence
He has gotten her full attention
Is this some kind of a joke
More of a game, really
Casey eyes the glass doors, then looks up the hallway to the front doors
moving to it
It's unlocked
She bolts it
'm two seconds from calling the police
They'd never make it in time
Casey moves her face flush against the door, her eye looking through the peephole
distorted view of the front porch
It is empty
She relaxes a bit, relieved
What do you want
(pure evil) Casey's jaw drops as total fear storms her face
She hangs up the phone, throwing it down on a side table when
Casey leaps out of her skin
She turns to the door as it chimes again
(calling out) Who's there
Another
She moves to it
(louder) Who's there
No answer
Fuck this
It's time for the police
She goes for the portable phone
Just as she picks it up
Casey almost drops it, losing her breath
She brings it to her ear with trembling hands, saying nothing
listening, waiting
long silence
And then
You should never say "Who's there
"
Don't you watch scary movies
It's a death wish
Casey clutches the wall, nearly collapsing
She tries her damndest to hang tough
Look, enough is enough
You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else
Or else what
her face, her mind thinking, calculating
My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when  tell him
thought you didn't have a boyfriend
Busted
She holds steady
lied
do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone
Sure
swear it
And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you
'm getting scared
'm telling you the truth
lied before
believe you
So you better leave
His name wouldn't be Steve, would it
Silence
Casey buckles at the knees, losing it
How do you know his name
Go to the back door and turn on the porch light--again
Casey, terrified, forces herself to move
staggering to the kitchen
to the glass doors
Her shaky hand finds the light switch
she hits it
The back yard is lit
Sitting in a lawn chair in the middle of the backyard is a big, line backer of a guy, her boyfriend
tied and gagged
He's been roughed up, but he's alive
his eyes
wide in fear
staring at his girlfriend, pleading with her
Oh Goddddd
Casey
Her hand moves to the lock on the door
wouldn't do that if  were you
Terror rides Casey's face
She's petrified
Where are you
Guess
Her eyes search the yard, combing bushes, trees
He could be anywhere-anywhere
(begging) Please don't hurt him
That all depends on you
Why are you doing this
Tears find their way, streaming down Casey's face
wanna play a game
No
Then he dies
Right now
Which is it
long silence
Casey touches the glass
staring at
this big jock of a guy is crying too
What kind of game
Turn off the light
Her hand goes to the switch
Steve tugs and pulls at his straps
as if begging her
his face sweat and tears
He disappears in the darkness
Casey moves away from the glass, back toward the living room, unbelieving, horrified
Here's how we play
ask a question
If you get it right-Steve lives
Three curtainless windows line one wall
Casey crouches down behind the couch, tipping a lamp cord from it's socket, darkening the room
Her body quivers
Please don't do this
Come on
It'll be fun
No
please
It's an easy category
Movie trivia
(begging) please
'll even give you a warm up question
Don't do this
can't
Name the killer in
No
Come on
It's you favorite scary movie, remember
He had a white mask, he stalked the baby-sitters
Casey goes silent
a nervous wreck
she can barely speak much less think
don't know
Come on, yes you do
Please
stop
Casey is
What's his name
can't think
Casey has officially reached hysteria, petrified beyond all reality
Steve's counting on you
Suddenly
through tears
Godsent
(a whisper) Michael
Michael Myers
Casey
relieved
Now for the real question
But you're doing so well
Please go away
Leave us alone
Then answer the question
Same category
Casey is a blubbering, wet mass on the floor
please
no
Name the killer in   13TH
mad smile purses Casey's lips
She knows this
She leaps up, through tears, screaming
Jason
Jason
slight
'm sorry
That's the wrong answer
No it's not
It was Jason
Afraid not
It was Jason
saw that godamned movie twenty times
It was Jason
Then you should know Jason's -Mrs
Vorhees was the original killer
Jason didn't show up until the sequel
Casey is stupefied
You tricked me
Lucky, for you there's a bonus round
But poor Steve
'm afraid
he's out
This implication sends Casey running to the kitchen
to the glass doors
She flips on the porch lights to see
eyes wide, sitting in the lawn chair
his belly gaping open
a mass of blood and ripped flesh
his insides lay on the ground between his feet
steam rising
erupts from the bottom of her soul as Casey collapse on the floor
nearly passing out
her face
pale and ghostly white
She
Final question
Are you ready
She doesn't answer
long, maddening silence
Casey reaches up and  off the light, making Steve go away
wishing, hoping
leave me alone
please
Answer the question and  will
Casey is curled up on the floor like an infant, rocking slowly back and forth
What door am  at
What
There are two doors to your house front door and a back one
If you answer correctly-you live
From where Casey sits she can see both front and back doors
She deliberates
with her last bit of strength she tries to strategize
Eyeing both, the front door
the back door trying to decide between the two
Don't make me
can't
won't
Your call
In the darkness, Casey crawls to the kitchen counter-she leans up and grabs a long, sharp knife
Casey looks around her
she looks down the hall to the front door
then turns back to the kitchen glass door as it suddenly
as a lawn chair come flying through it
Exploding glass sprays everywhere
This incites Casey like fire
She springs to her feet
bolting out of the kitchen as a  moves quickly through the shattered doorframe
Somewhere in the house, back flat against a window, listening to She turns and unlocks the latch, quietly sliding it up
She can hear him move through the foyer
to the front door
Casey lifts herself up and puts her legs through the window
She holds the knife in one hand, the phone in the other
Casey eases out the window, fumbling, dropping the knife back in the house
She starts to reach for it
Fuck it, she takes off
Casey it at the back corner of the house
can hear you
know you're here
Casey eases along a narrow path between a tall fence and the side of the house
going for the front yard
She must pass the three curtainless windows
She gets to the first one and peeks in
The  has pulled open the foyer closet, searching for her
Casey creeps along, to the next window, she looks in
the is completely on the other side of the room moving toward the hall that leads to other parts of the house
She moves further along the house
squeezing by hedges
to the third window
she peeks in to the
His face covered with a ghostly white mask, inches from her
his eyes piercing through
soulless
Casey    as a hand
through the glass window grabbing hold of her neck
she beats at him trying to free herself
her nails dig into his arm
she wrenches from side to side
finally breaking free as the hands disappear inside the house
Casey sails around the corner of the house, eyeing the front door
It remains closed
Her eyes cover the sprawling country yard when suddenly
in the distance, coming down the road towards the house
she recognizes them instantly
Mom
Dad
she tears off across the yard toward them
moving like lightning
The car turns into the driveway
Casey , waving madly, rushing by a tree as
Casey stumbles back, catching her balance
the  moves on her, arm poised high
a flash of silver
and Casey is struck, across the chest
She looks down to see her shirt blossoming red
a look of bewilderment as she drops to one knee
The knife rises again
Casey throws her hand forward
the blade comes down
but it's blocked by the portable phone still in her hand
She turns staggering to
-  emerge from the parked car
They move to the front door completely unaware of what's happening to their daughter, only feet from them
Casey stumbles forward
her parents ten feet away
she opens her mouth to scream but no sound resonates
she is beyond words
staggering, swaying
the  moving behind her
Her parents approach the door That fish smelled strong
told you to send it back
The father discovers the front door ajar
puzzled look
Casey is right behind them with one arm outstretched
If they'd only turn around
They enter the house and close the door as
Casey collapses on the ground, clutching her bloody chest
the upon her
The father sees straight back into the kitchen
the shattered patio door
Jesus
What is it
Where's Casey
(calling out) Casey
Casey
In a split second they're both panic stricken
The father begins searching the house frantically
The mother is hysterical
Casey
she's dragged by her feet through damp soil
the life going fast from her body
her hand still clutching the phone
Back in the house
Where is she
Call the police
The mother moves  to the phone in the foyer, picks it up
There is no dial tone
She jiggles the base
(searching) Casey
Where are you honey
Call the police, goddammit
The phone's dead
The
the softest
faintest voice is heard
(from phone) help me
She's here, God,  can hear her
Where's my baby
The husband returns to the foyer finding his wife clinging to the phone
Where is she
can hear her
Oh Mother of God, can hear her
The father upturns the living room
Casey
Casey
Not my daughter
not my
The husband grabs hold of his wife
Get in the car and drive down to the Mackenzie's
The other throws the front door open and rushes out
the father moves through the house when a  echoes out
That of his wife
He tears off for the front door
The father rushes out the door to find his wife, on her knees, bent over, retching
His eyes move beyond to a tree in the front yard
his stomach fails him
his dinner rises
as he bares witness to the single, most horrifying sight he'll ever see
That of his only daughter as she hangs from a big oak tree
strung up
very much dead
her stomach ripped open
: - teenage girl's room
Neat and pinkish
On the bed, amongst age- old stuffed animals lie opened school books
The   to a desk against the wall where
a young girl of 17, sits, her face glued to the computer monitor in front of her
her face
Sharp and clever with deep, lonely eyes
She's comfortable in a plain, flannel nightgown
Her hands are at work, typing feverishly, when suddenly
- noise behind her
She turns abruptly, eyeing an open window across the room
sound
She stands and moves toward it
Sidney sticks her head out the window
The late night wind hits her face as a  appears just to the left of her, a hand reaches out, grabs her and suddenly a  is on top of her
Sid
pulling away from the figure
breaking free, falling back onto the floor
(o
c
) Hey
it's just me
Sid looks up to see
young, strapping boy of seventeen
Handsome and alluring star quarterback/ class president type of guy
He sports a smile that could last for days
Billy
What the
'm sorry
Don't hate me
What are you doing here
You sleep in
Billy pulls himself through the window
(whispering) My dad's in the other room
'll only stay a sec
Suddenly
The bedroom door  open
The doorknob catches on the open closet door behind it jamming it, holding it in place
(from behind door) What's going on in there
Billy quickly rolls out of sight behind the bed
Sidney unjams the door to reveal
, late 40's, a severe presence
distracted man, nervous and pre-occupied
Are you okay
Can you knock
heard screaming
No you didn't
No
Oh, well
'm hitting the sack
My flight leaves first thing in the morning
Now the expo runs all weekend so won't be back til Sunday
There's cash on the table and 'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton
out at the airport
so call if you need me
Got it
He gives the bedroom a quick once over
coulda swore  heard screaming
Sidney distracts him, giving him a peck on the cheek
Have a good trip
Sleep tight, sweetie
He gives her a wink and pulls the door closed
Billy reappears
Close call
What are you doing here
Billy takes a flying leap and lands on the bed
It just occurred to me that 've never snuck through your bedroom window
Now that it's out of your system
And  was home, bored, watching television,   was on and it got me thinking of you
Oh it did
Yeah, it was edited for
All the good stuff was cut out and  started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "" rating on our way to an NC17
And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of
edited for television
So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would  have little bump- bump
No, no
wouldn't dream of breaking your underwear rule
just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff
She snuggles up next to him, planting a kiss on his lips
Passionate and gentle
He, however, reacts like a shark, moving on top of her, his hands everywhere as he presses into her
Sidney breaks away
Time to go, stud bucket
Billy sits up
His heart isn't racing
it's
See what you do to me
Sweat has popped out all over his forehead, his breathing heavy
You know what my dad will do to you
'm going
'm going
He moves to the window
She follows, motioning to his wound
appreciate the romantic gesture
She gives him a kiss goodnight
Sweet and simple
(whisper) Hey
about the sex stuff
'm not trying to rush you
was only half serious
She kisses him again as he eases through the window
Would you settle for a -13 relationship
What's that
She pulls her flannel gown open for a split second
flashing her left breast
His mouth drops open
surprise, shock
Their eyes meet
They share a smile
Get outa here
'  - on Sidney snuggling her pillow, sleeping peacefully when
from the night table loud enough to wake the dead
Sidney bolts up
(from radio) found brutally murdered
Sidney, quick with the reflexes, shuts it off instantly
car trunk  shut outside
Sidney pulls herself out of bed and leans to the window just in time to see her Dad jumping in his car
She half waves down at him but he doesn't see her
He's as good as gone, pulling out of the driveway and disappearing down the road
moment as Sidney stands at the window, staring out after him
- "
" a picture perfect small town school
Old and charming
Students come and go, moving about
Nothing unusual, except for the
six police cars, four news vans, flashing cameras, and crowds and crowds of lookie-loo's gathered just off campus
Sidney approaches the school seeing the commotion
Four different stand in front of four different cameras giving four different news reports
She moves passed a policeman standing guard
Her interest peaked, she stops at the first reporter who is
Thirties
He smart face is overshadowed by a flashy smile and a massive mane of chemically enhanced hair
(for the camera) The small town of Bayboro, North Carolina was devastated last night when two young teenagers were found brutally butchered
Authorities have yet to issue a statement but our sources tell us that no arrest has been made and the murderer could strike again
Moved, disturbed
From behind, a finger taps her shoulder
She spins around to see
Tatum Riley, same age, feisty, carefree
Do you believe this shit
What happened
They break away from the crowd and head for school
Oh God
You don't know
Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night
No way
And not just killed, Sid
We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end
Casey Becker
She sits next to me in English
Not anymore
Her parents found her hanging from a tree
Her insides on the outside
Do they know who did it
Fucking clueless-they're interrogating the entire school
Teachers, students, staff, janitors
They think it's school-related
They don't know
Dewey said this is the worst crime they've ever seen
Even worse than
(stopping herself) Well it's bad
They're bringing in the feds
This is big
Sidney looks back at Gale, her face deeply pained
- frumpy old woman,
, faces her class
Her hands clasped together
tragic look upon her face
a terrible tragedy
An unbearable loss
It's days like today we need prayer in school
Sidney sits near the rear of the room
The desk in front of her sits vacant
Sidney can't take her eyes of it
The door opens and a student opens with a slip of paper
He hand s it to Mrs
Tate
Sidney
It appears to be your turn
' The room is at capacity
wall to wall with police, and the likes
Some sit, stand, lean
, a round man in his fifties, wipes the stress from his face
Who's up next
young officer looks at the clipboard
This is  , better known as
He's a big guy, 20's, handsome in a scrubbed-clean boyish way
Sidney Prescott
Sheriff Burke gestures to bring her in
, 50's, an old codger of a man wearing a sour face speaks up
Sidney Prescott
She was daughter of
We all know Sidney, Mr
Himbry
How she doin'
She's adjusted well
Maintains an "" average
You never know she
Himbry stops short, seeing Sidney in the doorway
He rises and seats her
Hi Sidney
Sheriff Burke
Dewey
Dewey shakes his head seriously
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid
How is everything
Good
And your Dad
How's he doing
We're fine
Thanks
We'll be brief, Sidney
The police have a few questions they'd like to ask you
Sidney eyes them all nervously
- Students sit at outdoor tables eating lunch
Crowded at one table is the "gang"
This consists of Sidney, Billy and Tatum
Next to Tatum, sits her boyfriend , with his arm draped across her back
He's a Billy wannabe
Almost the jock, almost handsome, almost cool
He tries way to hard
Across the table is the fifth wheel,
tall and gangly kid with no such Billy-like aspirations
witty jokester who elevates geek to coolness
Hunt
Why would they ask if you like to hunt
don't know, they just did
Because their bodies were gutted
Sidney flinches
Thanks Randy
They didn't ask me if  like to hunt
Because there's no way a girl could have killed them
That is so sexist
The killer could easily be female-
That was an ice pick-not exactly the same
Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out
Takes a man to do something like that
Or a man's mentality
(quiet, almost to herself) How do you gut someone
All eyes turn to Sidney
serious silence
And then: You take a knife and slit from the groin to the sternum
Sidney shivers down to her soul
The whole table rolls their eyes at Stu
What
She asked
It's called tact, you fuckrag
Sorry
Remember in  when they caught the wrong shark at first and Richard Dreyfuss cut it open to look foe body parts and all they found was a licence plate and all this white milky goo
Stu leans over and socks Randy in the arm
You heard Billy-shut the fuck up
Hey, Stu
Didn't you use to date Casey
Stu's taken back, a little off guard
For about two seconds
Before she dumped him foe Steve
Tatum turns to Stu, surprised
thought you dumped her for me
did
He's full of shit
And are the police aware you dated the victim
(offended) What are you saying
That  killed her or something
It would certainly improve your high school
Stu was with me last night
Oooooh
before or after he sliced and diced
Fuck you, nut case
Where were you last night
Working, thank you
thought Blockbuster fired you
Twice
didn't kill anybody
No one's saying you did
Besides- (perfect Stu mimic) "Takes a man to do something like that
" 'm gonna gut your ass in a second
(to Stu) Did you really put her liver in the mailbox
hear they found her liver in the mailbox
(eyeing Sidney) Randy, you goon-fuck, 'm eating here
Stu nibbles at Tatum's neck
Yeah, Randy, she's getting mad
think you better liver alone
Stu cracks up at his own joke
The others just
Sidney is about to crawl out of her skin, trying hard to ignore it all
'  - huge two story country home with a spacious lawn
yellow school bus stops in front of the house and Sidney steps off
The house looks big and lonely as Sidney moves up the walk to the front door
- Sidney is on the telephone
(into phone) You sure  can stay over
My dad won't be back til Sunday
(through phone) No prob
'll pick you up after practice
Tell your mom  said thanks
Yeah, yeah
are you okay
Uh-huh, it's just
you know, the police and reporters
it brings it all back
'll be there by seven
promise Thanks, Tatum
Later
Sidney hangs up
She takes a seat at her computer and boots it up
She sits in front of it staring at the blue screen
her own reflection staring back
- Sidney comes down the stairs, her arms carrying a change of clothes, toothbrush, make-up
She opens the hall closet and pulls a small overnight bag from the top shelf
Moving into the living room she loads it up, plopping down on the sofa, hitting the  remote
news reporter fades in
#1 (on ) The entire nation was shocked today by the teen murders in North Carolina
Sidney switches channels
#2 The State Bureau of Investigation has joined forces with local authorities to help catch what the Governor has called the most heinous
The channel switches again
Gale weathers appears, standing in front of the school
Her white teeth gleaming
This is not the first time the small town of Bayboro has endured such tragedy
Only a year ago, Maureen Prescott, wife and mother, was found raped and murdered
An old black and white snapshot fills the screen-a woman, beautiful and familiar
eyes frozen, mesmerized by the image
Suddenly she  the off
Her eyes go to the clock on the end table
5:45
Her eyes then move to the framed photo next to it
the same black and white photo stares at her
a healthy, vibrant woman
An older version of Sidney
Sidney curls up on the sofa closing her eyes tight
- The clock on the end table reads 7:15
Sidney is fast asleep on the couch
The phone
Sidney leaps up grabbing the portable phone
(from phone) Practice ran late
'm on my way
(eyes clock) It's past seven
Don't worry
Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten
'm not worried
Good, 'cause  wanna swing by and get us a video
was thinkin' Tom Cruise in You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis
Whatever
Just hurry
Bye
She hangs up the phone
It immediately  again
(into phone) Tatum
' (from phone) Hello, Sidney
'
Hi
Who is this
You tell me
Sidney thinks, trying to place his voice
It sounds a little distorted
have no idea
Scary night, isn't it
With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away
Are you calling from work
Tatum's on her way over
Do you like scary movies, Sidney
like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy
It's sexy
What's your favorite scary movie
Don't start
You know  don't watch that shit
And why is that
(playing along) Because they're all the same
It's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl-who can't act-who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door
They're ridiculous
brief silence
Are you alone in the house
That is so unoriginal
You disappoint me, Randy
Maybe that's because 'm not Randy
So who are you
The question is not who am
The question is where am
So where are you
Your front porch
This gives her pause
She moves to the window and pulls aside the drapes
Why would you call me from my front porch
That's the original part
She can't quite see all of the porch
Oh yeah
Well  call your bluff
Sidney goes to the front door
She unlocks the bolt, unsnags the chain, and pulls the door open
revealing the front porch
She steps out onto it, phone still in hand
single light shines overhead illuminating the porch, but little beyond
Darkness is all around
So where are you
Right here
Sidney peers out into the darkness past thick shrubs that grow on either side of the porch
Can you see me right now
Uh-huh
What am  doing
She sticks her finger up her nose, pretending to pick
Silence
No answer
Good try, Randy
Tell Tatum to hurry
Bye now
If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother
Sidney stops dead in her tracks, speechless
(deadly) Do you want to die, Sidney
Your mother didn't
His seriousness unnerves her
Sid flies off the handle
She hangs up on him
Moves back inside the house
Locks, chains, and bolts the door when
rushing her, ramming into her side
the phone flies
the  is on top of her as she goes down
She looks up to see the , darkly dressed with a pale, distorted face, white and ghostly
a mask
Her instincts surface and she kicks up with her foot making the contact with his leg
he topples over
coming right at her, his hand finding her neck
Suddenly, along, silver blade appears above her
Sidney pulls, jerks, twists
finally she lifts her torso forward knocking the  off her
sending him reeling into the living room
Wasting no time, Sidney leaps to her feet
She moves to the front door, unlocks it
pulls it open
it catches on the chain
Shit
She pushes it closed again looking behind her
the  has risen, knife in hand
Sidney pulls on the chain and then-inexplicably turns and
The  right behind her
The  leaps at Sidney taking hold of her foot, she grabs madly at the wall
her hands grasp a framed painting-a quiet country home, subdued colors, done in oils-she rips it from the wall swinging it behind her
It catches the  head on, smashing against his skull, sending him backwards, tumbling down the stairs
Sidney races to her bedroom
She locks the door shut, the pulls her closet door open, placing the edge right at the door knob just as
ramming it, it rips open, but the closet door catches it in a crazy vice-like hold
Sidney grabs the desk phone
It's dead
off the hook downstairs
The figure rushes the door several times
the frame splinters
but won't give
Sidney is at her computer, she punches at the keypad madly
9-1-1 The knife slashes through the crack in the door wildly
34 Sidney presses  when it occurs to her-all is quiet
The is gone
fearful silence
She looks around
the only sound her own rapid, terrified
"Stay calm
Police enroute
" Suddenly a  at the window
Sidney looks up to see
her boyfriend, staring at her, surprised
Oh Billy
Please
God
heard screaming
The door was locked
Are you okay
He's here
He's trying to kill me
Billy pulls himself through the window
As he does, a small black object falls from his dark jeans
It hits the floor as Sidney eyes it
a sleek, compact cellular phone
Sidney stops in her tracks
Their eyes meet
an eternity is heard in the distance
Sidney bolts
Hey
wait
what's goin
Billy reaches for her
Sidney unblocks the bedroom door and tears out of the room
Sidney nearly falls down the stairs
She rips the chain off the door, pulls it open, coming face to face with a white, ghostly mask
massive  erupts from her gut as
to find Dewey-Deputy Riley, holding it
Red lights flash, sirens vas car after car surrounds the house
Sidney falls into the safety of Dewey's arms
- The yard is a whirlwind of activity
An ambulance, squad cars, cops everywhere
' as it  against the hood of a police car
His hands are being cuffed, his rights being read
(screaming) didn't do anything
Sid
where's Sid
Ask her, she'll tell ya
Dewey holds a car door open as Sheriff Burke steps out
We got him, Sheriff
Billy Loomis
Hank Loomis' kid
Aw
Jesus
He's her boyfriend
They approach Billy as he's being placed in a squad car
Sheriff
didn't do it
please, call my Dad
please
The squad car disappears with Billy as another car comes to a stop in front of the house
Tatum gets out, freaked beyond belief
Back to the Sheriff and Dewey as they storm across the yard
was first to respond
What were you doing out here
Drive by patrol
How is she
She's tough
Have to be
The shit she's gone through
Across the yard sits Sidney, in the back of an ambulance as check her out
Sheriff Burke and Riley approach
We're seeing a lot of you today
She tries to smile but fails
You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit
yeah
appears, barreling past an
What happened
Oh God
Tatum rushes to her, grabbing hold of her
(to Tatum) What are you doing here
Oh, God, Sid, 'm sorry  was late
You can't be here, Tatum
This is an official crime scene
It's okay
She was supposed to pick me up
Her dad's out of town
She's staying with us
Does mom know
Yes, you doofus
Two news vans come driving up the street
The vultures are coming
Let's get you out of here
big, white news van comes to a stop in front of the house
The side door slides open and Gale Weathers hops out just in time to see Sidney being escorted to a squad car
'll be damned
Jumping from the driver's seat is , Gale's cameraman and flunky
An earnest young chap on the chubby side
What
What
Jesus
The camera-hurry
But it's too late
Sidney is as good as gone
Gale sees Tatum moving quickly to her car
Excuse me
Tatum looks up to see Gale Weathers rushing her
Was that Sidney Prescott they took away
don't know
Tatum hops in her car, ignoring her
What happened to her
'm not talking to you
Tatum's car peels out as Kenny comes running up with his camera
Where'd she go
Gale spins around, flashing her pearly whites
Look, Kenny,  know you're about fifty pounds overweight but when  say hurry please interpret that as Gale moves back to the van leaving Kenny miffed
small town station
The bull pen is a little square room with four desks and tonight--it's hopping
Cops everywhere
' Sidney sits at a desk drinking a cup of water
She wears the Sheriff's jacket over her shoulders
Dewey approaches
Did you reach my Dad
You're sure it was the Hilton
At the airport
He's not registered
Could he have gone to another hotel
don't know
guess
We'll find him, Sid
Don't worry
Sidney stares blankly, numb
' Billy sits opposite Sheriff Burke
Next to Billy, sits his father,  , an older version of Billy
What are you doing with a cellular telephone, son
It's my phone
He was just playing around with it
You got some ideas of playing around, boy
didn't call anyone with it
just took it for fun
Everybody's got one now
Why don't you check the phone bill for chrissakes
Call my carrier--AirFone Comp
They'll have records of every number dialed
Thank you, Hank
We're on it
What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight
just wanted to see her, that's all
You rode your bike out there
Yes, sir
And last night
Sidney said you crawled through her window last night too
(surprised) You were out last night
watched  for awhile but the  felt like going for a bike ride
Did you ride past Casey Becker's house
No,  didn't
didn't kill anyone, Sheriff
We're gonna have to keep you, Billy
The governor's got , , and god knows who else on their way down here
Billy fights tears
This is crazy
didn't do it
Sheriff Burke eyes him up and down, very carefully
- Tatum has joined Sidney
The sheriff's door opens and Billy is led out by a coupla
Burke and Dewey appear in the door watching Tatum comfort Sidney
That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart
Neither of which keep purchase records
What about the cellular phone bill
They're pulling Loomis' account
But it'll be morning before we see something
You think he did it
Twenty years ago  woulda said not a chance
But these kids today
damn if know
(o
s
) Hey
Dewey
Can we go now
Hold up a sec
She staying with you
We haven't located her Dad yet
(o
s
) Goddammit, Dewey
Dewey turns to her, his face red
What did Mama tell you
When  wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law
'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go
Use the back way
Avoid the circus
- The door opens and Sidney, Tatum, Dewey, and a coupla exit avoiding the horde of  that can be seen around the corner waiting anxiously at the front entrance
'll get the car
Wait here
Dewey takes off
From the darkness of the alley, Gale Weathers appears with Kenny and his camera
They've been waiting
Hello Sidney
Sidney spins around to see Gale, standing, smiling at her
Sidney's body tightens and her face goes taut
Some night
Are you alright
Their eyes meet in cold familiar stare
Sidney says nothing
She's visibly shaking
What happened
She's not answering any questions
Just leave us alone, okay
It's okay, Tatum
She's just doing her job
Right,
Yes, that's right
Dewey, in a squad car, turns into the alley and pulls up
The other news people have wisened up
They begin to flock the alley
How's the book
It'll be out later this year
Sidney tries to contain herself
squeezing a clenched fist
'll look for it
'll send you a copy
In a blurred, unexpected instant, Sidney brings her fist forward, it hard into Gale Weathers's face
The impact sends Gale reeling backwards, knocking into Kenny as they both tumble to the pavement
breathing deep, a sense of satisfaction on her face
'  - spacious bedroom
Typical
Tatum and Sidney lay on the bed
They both wear night shirts
God,  loved it
"'ll send you a copy
" Bitch went down
"'ll send you a copy
"
Sid--SuperBitch
Dewey appears in the doorway holding a bag of ice
thought you might want some ice for that right hook
Sidney sits up, takes the ice, and puts it on her hand
'll be right next door
Try to get some sleep
Dewey moves back out the door
Any word on my Dad
(turning to her) Not yet, but we're looking
If you need anything
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Dewey smiles, pulling the door closed on his way out
Sidney lies back down
Just another sleepover at the Riley's
Just like old times, ain't it
No, nothing's like it used to be
Sidney rolls over at her side, away from Tatum
telephone  somewhere in the house
Do you really think Billy did it
He was there, Tatum
knew this guy was too perfect
He was destined to have a flaw
at the door
It opens and a friendly, graying woman pops in
This is
She wears a comforting smile
Telephone, dear
Who is it
It's for Sid My Dad
Mama Riley shakes her head sadly
Take a message
It's alright
'll get it
Sidney takes off out the door
Mama Riley motions to Tatum
(whispers) How is she
Tatum shrugs
Sidney grabs the phone at the end of the hall
Hello
(from phone) Hello Sidney
'
The  does a Hitchcock as Sidney's entire body goes weak
his  moving through her
invading her
She Mama Riley turns in the doorway
Tatum comes bolting out of the bedroom
(from phone) Poor Billy-boyfriend
An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy
again
Who are you
Hang up, Sid
Don't worry
You'll find out soon enough
promise
Mama Riley  on a closed bedroom door
Dewey
Dewey
This is gonna be fun, Sidney
Just like old times
Dewey flies out of his room wearing only his boxers
holding his gun
What
What
The phone goes dead
Sidney stands frozen
-  - The morning sun shines high over Bayboro Townsquare
Cars come to life, townsfolk stir as the picture postcard community awakens from a restless sleep
- Sidney and Tatum sit at the kitchen table, dressed and ready for school as Mama Riley serves up breakfast
small television sits on the counter
Dewey, in uniform, stands near the door, talking on the phone
think you girls really should stay home today
Your objection is duly noted
'd rather be around a lot of people, Mama Riley
From the , Sidney hears her name, "
"  All eyes go to the television
(on ) who escaped a vicious attack last night was the daughter of Maureen Prescott who was brutally killed last year when convicted murderer Cotton Weary
of  , in prison fatigues
once handsome man, now haggard and worn
(cont'd) broke into their home and savagely raped and tortured the deceased
Cotton Weary is currently awaiting appeal for the death sentence handed down after the young Sidney testified against him
She was the key witness in the state's prosecution
It's never gonna stop
Is it
Dewey is off the phone
Billy was released
His cellular bill was clean
He didn't make those calls
Somebody called me, Dewey
'm not making it up
know
We're checking every cellular account in the county
Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross- referenced
It's gonna take time but we'll find him
And my Dad
Any word on him
Riley shakes his head "no"
- Once again,  line the street attacking students as they make their way to school, asking questions, hungry for that teenage insight
Dewey's patrol jeep cruises by
Sidney watches from the passenger's window
Dewey pulls up in front of the school
Tatum hops out while Sid lingers, suddenly unsure
Dewey takes notice
Hey, it's school
You'll be safe here
Sidney forces herself out of the jeep as a microphone is shoved in her face
How does it feel to almost be brutally murdered
Dewey leaps from the car, intercepting the reporter
Leave the girl alone, will ya
She wants to go to school
Sidney eyes the newsvan that's pulled up behind her
The side door slides open and Gale Weathers steps out
Come on, Sid
Just a sec
need to talk to someone
She heads over to Gale
- Sidney, puts her head down, hiding her face
avoiding other reporters as she makes her way to
Gale who sits in the open door, checking her face in a mirror
Makeup tries hard to hide Sid's handwork-a swollen black and blue right cheek
Gale spots Sidney immediately and leaps to her feet
Stop right there
Sidney throws her hands up in surrender
'm not here to fight
Just stay back
want to talk to you
(calling into the van) Kenny
Camera
Now
Kenny's head darts out from the van
Off the record
No cameras
Forget it
Sidney contains herself
Please
You owe me
owe you shit
Gale moves inside the van
But Sidney is relentless
You owe my mother
Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case
Somebody was gonna write a book about it
And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories
What is your problem
You got what you wanted
Cotton Weary is in jail
They're gonna gas him
book is not gonna change that
Do you still think he's innocent
Gale's interest is peaked
She eyes Sidney suspiciously
He was convicted in a court of law
Your testimony put him away
It doesn't matter what  think
During the trial, you did all those stories about me
You called me a liar
think you falsely identified him
Yes
Have you talked to Cotton
Many times
Has his story changed
Not one word
He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all
He's lying
She wouldn't have touched him
He raped her, then butchered her
Her blood was all over his coat
He was drunk that night
He left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him
saw him leaving wearing it
But couldn't it have been someone else you saw wearing that coat
The same person who planted it in Cotton's car, framing him
The same person who really killed your mother
long beat
Sidney considers this for the millionth time
No, Cotton murdered my mother
But there's doubt in her voice
Gale's face lights up
You're not so sure anymore, are you
Sidney clams up
No, it was Cotton
Tatum comes waltzing up
(to ) Nice welt
Gale ignores her, zeroing in on Sidney, half realizing
The killer is still on the loose, isn't he
These murders are related
Yo--let's rock
Sidney starts to fidget
'm sorry  mangled your face
She take off with Tatum
Gale calls after her
Wait, Sidney, don't go
But Sidney and Tatum have already disappeared in the crowd of students moving across campus
Gale looks to Kenny
Jesus Christ
An innocent man on death row
killer still on the loose
Kenny, tell me 'm dreaming
You want to go live
Gale's mind races with possibilities
No, not so fast
We have nothing concrete
When did that ever stop you
You can't sit on this
This is huge
If 'm gonna blow this up- need hard proof
But it's so much easier when we make it up
Not this time
owe Cotton that much
Hell, even  thought that man was guilty
- Tatum and Sidney make their way across campus
Just relax
You're at school now
No one can get you here
But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody
He could be here at school right now
They move up the walk as a  falls in step behind them, sporting a
Serial killers are smart by definition
They minimize their risk
They plan and pre-calculate everything
Showing up here would be the most lame-brain move he could make
He promised me he'd be back
As easy as the figure appeared, it disappears-falling out of site, unseen by either of them
wouldn't put too much stock in a psycho's promise
They move up the front steps toward the main doors of the school as the    reappears
standing at the top of the steps
Sidney sees it first, stopping dead in her tracks
She steps back, spinning around to find
behind her as well, both of them approaching, closing in on her
Sidney starts to  when the two ghosts bust up , tearing off across campus
In front of the school we catch up a  doing a live remote
He holds a mask in his hand
This morning several students, in what appears to be a prank, have been spotted wearing masks
School officials have yet to comment but this is the same type of mask worn by the killer
- Just before the bell
The hallway is congested with students heading to class
Tatum is at her locker with Sidney
This is a mistake
shouldn't be here
want you to meet me here right after class, okay
Billy appears in the crowd, with Stu tagging behind
Tatum spots him first
Shit, what is he doing here
bet he's pissed
Just ignore him
You had good reason to think what you did
Billy and Stu approach
Billy's face is solemn
Hi, Sid
Can we talk a sec
Sidney says nothing
She can barely look at him
Tatum intervenes
You know if  were accused of carving up two people, 'd take the opportunity to skip school
Hey, go easy, Tatum
He didn't do it
Talk to me, Sid
Suddenly, a  erupts
All eyes go to a running down the hall, screaming wildly, running amuck
Why are they doing this
Are you kidding
This is like Christmas
Billy punches Stu in the side
Owwww
You open your mouth and stupidity pours out
Sorry
Sidney, clearly upset, takes off down the hall
Billy races off after her
(yelling) Stay away from her, Billy
Tatum  her locker door shut as the bell
- With first period underway, the halls have cleared
One or two struggling students can be seen rushing to class
Sidney moves quickly down the hall, rounding a corner, running smack into
They collide hard catching Sidney off guard, scaring the life out of her
She falls backwards, but Billy catches her fall
Jesus,
Hey, hey, it's just me
Sidney pulls away from him quickly
Billy feels the slight
What
You don't still think it's me
Sidney catches her breath
No
don't
it's just
Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me
The police say  scared him off
It wasn't me, Sid
know
He called again last night at Tatum's house
See, it couldn't have been me
was in jail, remember
'm so sorry
please understand
Understand what
That  got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me
You know that's not true
Then what is it
Is there somebody else
No
Is it the sex thing
Am  being too pushy
No, it's me, Billy
need time
'm still adjusting to my mom
It's been a year since she died
(correcting him) Tomorrow
One year tomorrow
When are you gonna let that go, Sid
When my mom left my dad-- just accepted it
This is the way it is
She's not coming back
(sharply) Your parents split up
It's not the same thing
Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere
You have to move on, Sid
Sidney starts to walk away but turns back, angry
'm glad to know you're coping so well with life, Billy
But some of us aren't so perfect
Some of us are just trying to hold on
Sidney disappears through a door marked ' , leaving Billy alone in the hallway
He  his forehead, pissed at himself
' Large and spacious
Closed bathroom stalls line one wall facing a row of sinks and a huge mirror
Sidney enters as   tinkle and talk--each from their respective stalls
#1 She was never attacked
think she made it all up
#2 Why would she lie about it
#1 For attention
The girl has some serious issues
Sidney listens intently
toilet
Sidney quickly jumps in a stall, hiding, just as  #1 appears from a stall
She looks like that voice--a snotty little twit
#1 What if she did it
What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve
#2 And why would she do that
#1 Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed them both in a jealous rage
Another toilet
#2 Why would Sidney want to be with Steve
She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy
#1 Maybe she's a slut just like her mom
Sidney listens
Her face weakening
#2 You're evil
#1 Please, it's common knowledge
Her mother was a trollop
#2 appears from her stall--another twit
They both stand in front of the mirror adjusting two snotty faces
#2 Cut some slack
She watched her mom get butchered
#1 And it fucked her up royally
Think about it
It makes perfect sense
Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc
Completely suicidal
And one day she snaps
She wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year
And homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression
From the stall, Sidney listens, her heart pounding, jaw quivering
#2 Where do you get this shit
#1 Ricki Lake
The two girls exit
Sidney moves out of the stall, catching her reflection in the mirror
Pathetic
Water  somewhere from a leaky pipe as wind  in from the cracked transom above the bathroom door
It sound almost like a whisper,   "Siddneey
" Sidney spins around
What the
She checks out the bathroom
The doors to the stalls are all closed
She bends down and scans beneath them, looking for feet
No one
Nothing
Sidney turns back to the mirror
Suddenly
(o
c
whisper) Siddneey
Unmistakable this time
The  strikes Sidney like a nail through the eye
It comes from one of the stalls
She stands thunderstruck, eyeing the stalls thru the mirror
Is someone there
long, morose silence
And then: (softly, simply) It's me, Sidney
Sidney spins around
Fuck no
'
Terror floods her face
She eyes the exit door, then the row of stalls she must pass to get to it
She checks under the stalls again
Nothing
where the fuck is he
She takes a step forward when
step down from a toilet onto the floor in the last stall
Sidney's face draws tight as the stall door begins to  open
She bolts forward, making a break for it
but slips on the wet floor
her feet flying out from under
Sidney reaches out
grabs hold of a sink
saves herself from falling
she glimpses a   in the mirror coming for her
hand grabs her shoulder as she  her body through the exit door
narrowly escaping
- Sidney flies out of the bathroom door
burning up the hallway, not looking back
, hearing her , peer out from an open doorway
as Sidney sprints by him, not stopping
running madly
'  - on a red-faced Principal Himbry as he reads someone the riot act
'm sickened
Your whole havoc-inducing, thieving, whoring generation disgusts me
The    to reveal two standing at attention
Mr
Himbry rips the mask off of one of the student's heads
Two students have been savagely murdered
And this is how we express our compassion and sensivity
He rips the mask off the other student
We throw on a mask and dance around campus just hoping someone else gets butchered before we get bored again
You're both expelled
The  doth protest
#1 Aw, come on, Mr
Himbry, it was just a joke
#2 Yeah, that's not fair
deep rooted hostility has taken over Mr
Himbry's face
Neither student budges, scared to even breathe
No, it's not fair
Fairness would be to rip your insides out and hang you from a tree so you can be exposed for the desensitized, heartless little shits that you are
Suddenly the door  open and Sidney appears, hysterical
(crying) He's here
saw him
he's here
Mr
Himbry rushes to her, arms outstretched
Easy child
Sidney collapses in his arms
- Dewey's patrol jeep is parked in front of the school
He stands in the open driver's door talking on the radio
(from radio) She's okay
Looks like some boys were teasing her
Himbry's shutting down the school though
want you to take look around
Yes, sir, sheriff
Dewey shuts the jeep door and heads for campus when Gale Weathers appears, her fake face aglow
Hi
Gale Weathers
Field Correspondent, know who you are, ma'am
How's the eye
Productive
So they're closing down the school
Well
uh
yes ma'am
For the time being
Dewey heads for the school building
Gale scurries along side him flirtatiously
And why is that
Has something happened
You're not supposed to be here, ma'am
know,  should be in New York covering the Sharon Stone stalker but who knew
Please, call me Gale
You look awfully young to be a police officer
Dewey's eyes wander down to Gale's long legs, the way her hips move as she walks
he's clearly distracted
'm twenty-five years old, ma'am
Twenty-five, huh
In a demographic study proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24
just missed you
Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area
Does the force require that you work out
Dewey looks away, blushing a bit
No, ma'am
Because of my boyish good looks, muscle mass has increased my acceptance as a serious police officer
They approach the school's front entrance
Suddenly, Mr
Himbry's in amplified through intercoms across campus via the system
They stop to listen
(via ) "Your attention please
Due to the recent events that have occurred and until it comes to a resolve--effective immediately--all classes are suspended til further notice
The Bayboro Police Dept
has also asked me to announce a city wide curfew beginning at 6 o'clock repeat
" Gale speaks over Mr
Himbry's voice
Boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer
Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am
The killer has yet to strike twice
Well, we can hope, can't we
We certainly don't have any leads
ghost mask, a cellular phone--not much there
We're tracking the cellular phone bill
Really
You small town guys are good
And have you located Sidney's father
No, not yet
He's not a suspect, is he
We haven't ruled out that possibil
Dewey, realizing he's said too much, clams up
If you'll excuse me, ma'am
Am  keeping you
'm sorry
That's quite alright
If  may say so, ma'am, you're much prettier in person
Dewey starts up the school's front steps as the bell
So you do watch the show
He turns to her earnestly as  come pouring out the front doors
just turned 25
was 24 for a whole year
You are precious
Please, call me Gale
She smiles deliciously, gives him a wink, then struts off as Dewey, like a nervous little school boy watches her go
- School is clearing out
The halls have begun to empty as Tatum escorts Sidney down the hallway
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh
It was him, Tatum
know it
Tatum wants to believe her but
You are not to be alone again
Is that clear
If you pee-- pee
Stu appears
Is this not cool or what
Hey, Sid, what happened
For once, Stu, drop it
Okay, but whatever you did--the entire student body thanks you
Stu moves to Tatum and gives her a kiss
And to celebrate this impromptu fall break,  propose we have a party
Tonight, my house
Are you serious
My parents are out of town
It'll be like my hurricane bash last year
Nothing extreme
Just a few of us, hangin'
Tatum warms to the idea
This could be good
What do you think, Sid
don't know
Come on
Pathos has it's perks
Sidney considers trying hard to be good spirited
Remember, there's safety in numbers
(giving in) Yeah, okay
whatever
Cool
See you guys tonight
Bring food
Stu speeds off, sliding down the empty hallway
'  - Mr
Himbry sits at his desk staring at the ghosts masks before him
He picks one of them up, snickering
Damn
He stands and moves to the closet next to his office door
He pulls it open to reveal a mirror hooked inside the door
He tries the mask on, pulling it over his face, looking in the mirror when
stops him
He rips the mask off his head, turns to his office door and opens it to reveal
He pokes his head into the outer office area and looks around
But no one's there
Yes
Hello
The place is empty
little suspicious he closes the door, catching his reflection in the closet mirror
He looks at the mask in his hands
Jesus, even he's jumpy
Two seconds later
Himbry grabs the door quickly, this time throwing it open
Again no one's there
He steps out into the outer office determined to catch a prankster
- Completely empty
Mr
Himbry moves through the outer office and into the school corridor
The overhead lights have been turned off and the corridor is now dark and deserted
He looks up and down the hall
Only a  is seen in the distance pushing a broom
Little shits
Mr
Himbry returns to his office
- Himbry reenters his office, moving to his desk, when he spots the closet door
This gives him a pause-he had left it open
Hadn't he
Suddenly, he can't remember
He shifts uneasy, reaching for the door knob, pulling the door open to reveal
He stands still a moment, suddenly realizing someone could easily now be standing behind the open closet door
Nervously, he pushes it shut to reveal
Himbry shakes away his jitters, realizing he's spooked himself
He continues to his desk, pushing his office door shut when
lunges from behind it
knife in hand
Quick and easy
Three quick jabs to the stomach and Himbry goes down
The    towering above him
'  -  - The late afternoon sun is quickly disappearing
Tatum and Sidney rock on the front porch looking out into the small town neighborhood
Dewey's patrol jeep is parked in the driveway
Despite loud music,  from an inside stereo, this is a quiet moment
Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth
Maybe he was having an affair with your mom
So you think my mom was a slut too
didn't say that, Sid
But you know there were rumors
Your dad was always out of town on business
Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman
If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court
You can't prove a rumor
That's why it's a rumor
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers
(delicately) It goes further back, Sid
There's been talk about other men
And you believe it
Well
you can only hear that Richard Gere-gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it
long silence as Sidney agonizes over all of this
She stands up and moves to the edge of the porch and stares out onto the neighborhood
If  was wrong Cotton, then he's still out there
Don't go there, Sid
You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick
Don't freak yourself out--we've got a long night ahead of us
You're right
'm cracking up
Ignore me
Come on, let's rock
Sid follows Tatum inside the house never seeing the that stands across the street, under a tree
His presence so subtle and unobtrusive you'd have to see this movie a second time to know he was there all along
- Stu is moving along main street when Billy comes barreling up next to him
How'd you do
Piece of cake
She'll be there
Thanks, butt wart
You did good
So you gonna try and make up with Sid
Duh
that's quick
was just asking
Why are you always at me
Because 'm trying to build your self- esteem
You're far too sensitive
Oh
Billy thumbs Stu's forehead
You ready to party hard tonight
You know it
They come to a building centrally located in the heart of Main Street
huge, blue monstrosity that's bigger than the local bank and post office combined
The sign in front reads - You typical Blockbuster--huge and crowded
Randy, in his Blockbuster get up, is busy reshelving returns when Stu appears-- knocking the videos out of his hand
Jesus, this place is packed
(picking up videos) We had a run in the mass murder section
You coming tonight
Yeah, 'm off early--curfew you know
(looking off) Now that's poor taste
What
Randy refers to Billy who stands down the aisle talking to (The twits from the bathroom perhaps
) If you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section
It was all a misunderstanding
He didn't do anything
You're such a little lap dog
He's got killer printed all over his forehead
The why'd the police let him go
Because, obviously they don't watch enough movies
This is standard horror movie stuff
revisited
Randy moves down the aisle, reshelving videos
Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend
There's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend
That's the beauty of it all
Simplicity
Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience
So what's his reason
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him
She's saving herself for you
Could be
Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me
think her father did it
How come they can't find his ass
Because he's probably dead
His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere
eyes gauged
See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch   they'd save time
There's formula to it
very simple one
Everyone's always a suspect--the father, the principal, the town derelict
Which is you
So while they're off investigating a dead end, Billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition
(o
c
) How do we know you're not the killer
Randy spins around to find Billy right behind him
Busted
Uh
hi, Billy
Maybe your movie-freaked mind lost it's reality button
Randy shrugs, laughing it off
You're absolutely right
'm the first to admit it
If this were a scary movie, 'd be the prime suspect
And what would be your motive
It's 1995--motives are incidental
- Dewey's patrol jeep makes it's way down mainstreet
It's almost dark
The street is close to deserted
- Dewey's behind the wheel having a heated conversation with Tatum while Sid stares out the window
party
Mom's gonna kill you
Then me
Don't be so self-righteous
It's just a little blow out--we'll be perfectly safe
Sid stares out the window
fill the storefronts, a few people rush to their car, in a hurry to beat curfew
God, look at this place, it's Hey,  saw that movie
True story, 'bout some killer in Texas
Hey, Sid
Just think if they make a movie about you
Who's gonna play you
Oh, god
Dewey comes to a stop, parking the car in front of the police station
He looks to Sid with a brotherly smile
see you as a young Meg Ryan myself
Thanks, Dewey
But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling
- They pile out of the jeep
Dewey heads for the station
'll just be a few minutes
Don't go far
The girls take off for the local supermarket that sits across the street
Is Billy going to be there tonight
He better not be
told Stu to keep his mouth shut
think we can live without '   for one night
They approach the grocery store
Small and simple
Sid and Tatum grab a shopping cart from the bin and enter the store, pushing the cart through two sliding glass doors
lone   behind the counter, big and frumpy, looks up from counting money
You girls gonna have to hurry it up
We're under curfew
Two minutes tops
They make a bee-line for the junk food section just as the automated doors slide shut behind them and a
appears, out of nowhere, standing just outside, watching, quietly through the glass store windows
- ' Sheriff Burke's face heats up as Deputy Riley marches in, hurriedly
Dewey
Where the hell you been, boy
Keeping my eye on Sidney
Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad
Real bad
Aircomp just faxed us
The calls were listed to Neil Prescott--Sidney's father
He made the calls with his cellular phone
It's confirmed
Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned
There's more
Guess what tomorrow is
The anniversary of his wife's death
It all fits
He's our man
Have you contacted the bureau
They believe he's out of state by now
We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night
If he's not picked up by morning--we'll do a house to house
You think he could still be in town
He'd have to be crazy
Where's Sidney
She's with my sister
Should  bring her in
Hold off for now
Just stay close to her
She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight
Watch her
Don't let on--just keep your eyes out
Yes, sir
- Sidney and Tatum push a basket through the junk food section
The store is completely empty
The girls gab freely
Billy's right
Whenever he touches me, just can't relax
You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death
It's no big deal
You'll thaw out
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum
You know, with all the sex stuff
How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic
Billy and his penis don't deserve you
Sidney grabs some chips and salsa from the shelf
Down the aisle, through the storefront window the    still stands watching their every move
Sid pushes the cart out of the glass door with Tatum riding it
The    is nowhere to be found
What do you think about when you're having sex
With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect
But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood,  think about Grant Goodeve
Sid pushes the cart and Tatum across the street
Who
Grant Goodeve--the oldest brother on Remember that show
He was the one who lived off alone
He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love
" He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from
God, was in love with Grant, he was so hot
The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years
Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman
How does that get you in the mood with Stu
During foreplay,  sing the theme song to myself
"Eight is enough to fill our lives with love
" It's a real turn on
No way
Grant wrote the song himself
'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "Eight is enough
" Sid pushes the cart up to Dewey's jeep
Tatum hops off
What secret meaning
Like a Satanical thing
Watch the show, Sid
His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing
Oh, Sidney
guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie
Watch out
Sidney stops just short of a laugh
Tatum pulls the back jeep door, loading the groceries in
Behind her, the appears, just out of their sight, behind the jeep's open back door
There's that sense of humor
knew it still existed
Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight
Deal
Sidney moves to the back door and closes it shut, when from behind
stands
Sid jumps, startled
You girls ready
Yeah
Looks like 'm your personal bodyguard tonight, Sid
No, Dewey
You'll ruin the whole night
Sorry, police orders
'll stay out of the way,  promise
Shit
Tatum kicks the shopping cart out of the way, blindly
It rolls down the road by itself, gaining speed on a decline running smack into the    who stops the cart cold with one hand
- Dewey's jeep makes it's way down a long, winding road
Headlights illuminate the thick woods that line each side
Following behind them at a discreet distance is a huge white newsvan
Dewey comes to the end of the road
It dead ends at
'  which sits alone in a clearing, big and ominous with no neighbors in sight
huge old home just ripe for a night of fun and
terror
From the looks of things the party has already started
Music is few  hang on the porch
- big room with  sprinkled throughout-smoking, drinking, cutting up
stereo  music while the  airs around the clock killer coverage
Tatum and Sid enter with groceries
Various  greet them
Caterer's here
The girls carry bags through a hallway that opens up onto an enormous kitchen
Stu and some  are leaning over the sink drinking beer through a funnel
That's mature
Where you guys been
We had to start without you
'  - The newsvan pulls up and parks unobtrusively on the side of the road a few feet down from the front yard
Kenny and Gale move around inside the van
Kenny hovers over a control panel complete with video monitors
What's the plan
Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities
Kenny picks up a compact video camera the size of his fist
He checks its battery pack
The control board's glitched
You know we can't carry a live picture
What's the delay
About thirty seconds
As long as it records  don't give a shit
We're not doing a remote
Gale slides open the side door and steps out into the darkness, not seeing the  that stands behind her
hand grabs her shoulder, Gale's heart stops as she spins around to find
Dewey, smiling, extremely pleased to see her
Evening, ma'am
Deputy
good evening
What brings you out to these parts
You never know when or where a story will break
Not much story here
Just a bunch of kids cutting loose
Then what are you doing here
Keeping an eye on things
Checking the place out
Mind if  join you
Dewey considers for a whole two seconds
Not at all
Gale leans in the van, grabs the camera from  Kenny's hand, and throws it in her bag
She gives Kenny a wink
a microwave
Popcorn  inside Sid, Stu, and Tatum moving about the kitchen, preparing a junk food feast
Other  pop in and out
Randy appears amongst them
He carries an armful of videos
thought we'd make it a night
He lets the videos splatter across the kitchen counter
Stu and Tatum dive in
thought everything was checked out
had 'em hid in the foreign section
Sidney peruses the videos
,  , --How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies
She's the Scream Queen
With that set of lungs--she should be
(to Sid) Tits--see
- The party is going strong
Ten maybe fifteen people stand, sit, lean
Some crowd around the floor in front of the television
Randy is taking a vote
How many  '
(hands go up) How many '
Hands go up
-, etc
The doorbell
Stu goes for it
got it
Tatum get me a beer
They're in the fridge in the garage
What am
The beer wench
(o
c
) Hey, guess who's here
It's that chick from
They look up the hallway to see Dewey and Gale standing in the foyer
Shit, Dewey
Everyone perks up, eyeing Gale
What is she doing here
She's with me
just wanted to check on things
The  in the room are drooling over Gale
Including Stu
So you did--now leave
and take your media muff with you
Tatum takes off for the kitchen
Gale has quickly become the focus of the party
All eyes are on her
watch your show regularly
This must be big news to be on Huge
Wanna interview us
We could be like two grief stricken students and we'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly
can cry on cue
Gale eyes the bookshelf above the television
Maybe later
Suddenly, Gale starts to
Can  trouble you for some water
How 'bout a beer
Randy--get the lady a beer
You get it
Gale slips the camera from her bag--hits the  switch and holds it behind her
waiting for the right moment
Have they found my father
Afraid not
Should  be worried
Not yet
Tatum is alone in the kitchen
She empties popcorn into a bowl, then pulls open the refrigerator
looks quickly, then remembers
She moves through the adjoining laundry room to the
The kitchen door opens and light floods the darkened garage
Tatum stands in the doorway searching for a light switch
She finds a button and hits it
The electric garage door starts to rise
Wrong switch
She hits it again and it closes
She finds another switch
small lightbulb overhead comes on, barely lighting the large two car garage, leaving pockets of shadows along the wall
Tatum spots the refrigerator against a far wall and heads for it, not seeing the kitchen door, quietly, slowly, closing behind her, sealing her off from the rest of the house
Tatum stumbles to the refrigerator and throws it open
Its light casts a glow across her face
-
Tatum jumps, spinning around just in time to see a cat escape through a large pet door that's built into the garage door
She smiles at her jumpiness
Tatum loads up with as many beer as her hands will carry and heads back to the kitchen
At the kitchen door, she juggles the beer, reaching for the knob
It's locked
She  it with her foot several times
Hey, Shitheads
moment
No answer
,
Tatum leans over and, with her elbow, hits the garage door button
It begins to rise
She moves towards the rising door, beer in hand
Suddenly, - The garage door , reversing direction, moving down, closing
What the
Tatum spins around to see
Silhouetted in the dark, next to the kitchen door, his hand on the switch
Tatum at once , taken back, but then relaxes
Is that you, Randy
Cute
The  stares at her, blankly
And what movie is this from Tatum takes a step towards the
Lose the mask
If Sidney sees it, she'll flip
The  shakes his head slowly from side to side
Oh, you wanna play psycho killer
The  slowly nods
Can  be the helpless victim
The  slowly nods again
Okay, let's see
"No, please don't kill me, Mr
Ghostface
want to be in the sequel
" Tatum takes a step to move around the , but he steps too, blocking her
Cut, Casper
That's a wrap
Tatum moves again, sidestepping the , but he's faster and cuts her off
Tatum juggles the beer against her chest with one hand and with the other pushes the  hard, knocking him aside
Randy--will you stop
But as the  intercepts, lunging forward, grabbing her wrist hard, Tatum stumbles
beer cans hit the floor, spewing
You little shit
Tatum yanks hard, releasing his hold when a flash of silver catches her eye
She looks down, glimpsing a long sharp blade as it darts forward, cutting into her forearm
Tatum pulls back, horrified, as the moment turns deadly serious
The  advances on her--knife out, ready
She staggers backwards, holding her bloody arm, backing into the refrigerator, Who are you
The  lashes out with the knife
Tatum dodges it, leaping back against the fridge
The  advances
Instinctively, she rips the top freezer door open,  the  in the face, sending him backwards, reeling
Tatum bolts to the
In a panic, she and on it, trying to make it lift
She eyes the
he's recovering
She goes for the pet door, dropping to the floor, diving for it
she wedges her upper body through, her head, shoulders, torso just as the
pounces, grabbing hold of her feet
Tatum goes crazy and  trying to get through
Tatum is half in/half out of the pet door
She  and wildly, unable to see the  on the other side
true fighter, Tatum kicks hard, making direct contact with the , knocking him away
She takes the moment to pull herself through further
but she stops
stuck
She pulls and tugs but can't move
She listens but hears nothing
Where did he go
An agonizing silence
And then
-
The garage door is activated
It begins to rise upward, taking Tatum with it
She
Tatum's arms and legs fly about violently as she tries to free herself from the door, but it moves too fast, carrying her up
She looks above to see where the door rolls back into garage rafters just as her neck hits the first beam,  instantly
- It's getting late and   leave through the front door, muttering, "parents and curfew", etc
The door hangs open wide
Sid moves to close it when
appears in a classic fake scare
Billy
Jesus, you scared me
Stu appears
(with a wink) Dude
What are you doing here
was hoping Sid and  could talk
If Tatum sees you--she'll draw blood
You guys can go up to my parents room
To talk and
whatever
Subtlety, Stu
Look it up
It's okay
We need to talk
Sid grabs his hand and leads him up the staircase
Randy appears from the kitchen just in time to see Sid and Billy disappear upstairs
What's Leatherface doing here
He came to make up
There goes my chance with Sid
Like you had one
Kenny fidgets at the control board
He hits a coupla buttons, bangs the side of the monitor and a picture emerges
the living room
The camera is positioned just above the television
The party is in full swing
Several  sit right in front of the television
Because of the camera's position they appear to be staring right into the lens
Suddenly, the van's side door slides open and Gale pops in
Got a picture
Perfect placement
We can see everything
Gale is ecstatic
Tell me, Kenny, has a cheesy tabloid journalist ever won the Pulitzer
large, master bedroom with glass doors that lead out onto a balcony
Sid and Billy stare at each other for a long moment
Awkward
So
So
'm sorry
've been a selfish shit and 'm sorry
No, Billy
'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress
You lost your mom
But you're right--enough is enough can't wallow in the grief process forever and  can't keep lying to myself about who my mom was
Billy bows his head quietly, knowingly
think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way 'm scared 'm gonna turn out just like her, you know
Like the bad seed or something
Oh Sidney
Everytime  get close to you  see my mom
know it doesn't make sense
Sure it does
It's like Jodie Foster in when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father
But this is life
This isn't a movie
Sure it is, Sid
It's all a movie
Life's one great big movie
Only you can't pick your genre
Billy moves to her
They embrace, tenderly
wanna let go
do
Ssshh
everything's gonna be okay promise
Sidney takes the initiative, acting on impulse, kissing him long and hard
She breaks away passionately, out of breath
Why can't  be a Meg Ryan movie
Billy nibbles her neck
Sshh
it's okay
Or even a good porno
(shocked) What
She stares at him, her eyes sexually charged
You heard me
(incredulous) Are you serious
(surprising herself) Yeah
think so
They smile at each other
- The camera sits on the book shelf lodged between two knickknacks, completely inconspicuous
The   to reveal several watching the --the horror diehards
#1 Look, here it comes
#2 The blood's not the right color
Why do they do that
It's too red
Here comes another
#3 Predictable
Knew he was going to bite it
How can you watch this shit over and over
Shhhhh
wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts
When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts
Not until   in '83
Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies
She didn't show her tits until she went legit
No way
That's why she always lived
Only virgins can outsmart the killer in the big chase scene in the end
Don't you know the rules
Stu finishes his beer
What rules
Randy hits the pause button on the remote and stands in front of the television, explaining
There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie
For instance: 1
You can never have sex
The minute you get a little nookie--you're as good as gone
Sex always equals death
2
Never drink or do drugs
The sin factor
It's an extension of number one
And 3
Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say "'ll be right back
" Wanna another beer
Yeah
'll be right back
Everybody "ooohhs"
There he goes folks--a dead man
Wave bye-bye
- Gale and Kenny watch the monitor
The party is clearing out some at the van door
Gale pulls it open to see Deputy Riley standing, his face all smiles
Sheriff just radioed me
'm gonna check out a possible lead
Thought you might like to join me
What kind of lead
car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road
'd love to
If you're sure it's alright
Ma'am,  am the Deputy of this town
Can  bring Kenny
(too quickly) mean
should probably take just you
Gale steps out of the van turning back to Kenny
'll be back
She slides the van door closed
- Gale heads for Dewey's patrol jeep
Actually,  thought we could walk
It's not far
Gale appears skeptical, but smiles anyway
She's genuinely smitten by this young guy
- fills the room
The party is reduced to the diehards in front of the television
(pointing to ) Look, here comes the obligatory tit shot
Beautiful
Finally
- Billy and Sidney are going at it
passionately
He has his head buried in her neck
(to herself) "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love
" It's working
Sidney pushes Billy off her as she pulls her shirt over her head
She fumbles with the clasp of her bra as the
on her breasts
Just as Sid's bra straps slide of her shoulders
Billy moves in front of the , pulling his jeans off, Blocking Sidney from view
- Back in the living room, the horror fest continues when the phone Everyone ignores it
It  again
Finally, Randy grabs the receiver from the side table
Hello
Yeah
Randy, freaked, drops the phone, finds the  remote and pauses the movie, the others protest "Hey, Put is back
" etc
Listen up
They found Principal Himbry dead
He was gutted and hung from the goal post on the football field
This stills the room
Complete silence as the news sinks in different faces
a moment of devastation
disbelief
And then: #1 So what are we waiting for
#2 Let's get over there before they pry him down
And in seconds the room is empty as everyone bolts for the door
' and '
leaving Randy, near drunk, alone in the living room
He returns to the movie
We were just getting to the good part
- Kenny is barely watching the monitor, he reached boredom some time ago
He finds a bag of Cheetos and chows down when he hears from outside
He peers out the window to see the last of the   pile into two cars and race off down the road
He chews a Cheeto slowly, his interest piqued
- The sex is over
and both Sid and Billy are dressing respectively
That post-sex awkwardness
Sid brushes out her hair as her eyes come to rest on the telephone on the nightstand
it puzzles her as a stark reveleation crosses her face
She turns to Billy who sits on the floor, putting on his shoes
Who did you call
What
When you're arrested-you're allowed one phone call
Who did you call
called my dad
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad
saw him
Yeah
and when  called no one answered
Uh-huh
You don't still think it was me
No, but if it were you, that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track
Using your one phone call to call me so  wouldn't think it was you
Billy stands up
What do  have to do to prove to you 'm not a killer
He makes a move toward her when
from behind, in a split instant, from the open balcony doors comes
Sidney sees the  immedietely,
Billy tries to calm her, oblivious to the advancing
Billy barely turns as a long steely blade rises high in the air
It strikes down with force
hitting his chest as blood sprays the air
as red crimson splatters across her face
as the knife is thrust in and out of Billy who tries hard to put up a fight
but it's useless
he never had a chance
His body falls to the floor
lifeless
as he watches Billy's body come to a still before quietly, calmly turning his attention to
who stands, numb
scared to death
And only when the takes a step forward does Sidney break
She takes off like a rocket
leaping over the bed and out the door
- Sidney tears out the door and down the hall, coated in Billy's blood
as he catches up with her, grabbing hold of her collar
She pulls away from him
her shirt ripping down the back
Her hands find a door knob and she goes for it, pulling the door open
moving quickly inside
locking it behind her
- Total darkness
Sidney's hands scour the wall for a light switch
The doorknob turns
the lock holds
as the door is nearly from it's hinges
and then
All goes silent
Only Sidney's rapid  fills the space around her
Sidney, trembling, shaking, reaches above her, feeling, until she finds a string
She pulls it
as a lightbulb  on overhead
She's in a small box of a room
The door is on one side, a small, narrow staircase on the other
She eyes the doorknob, then the staircase
contemplating
but it's an easy decision
There's no fucking way she's going up to the attic
She unlocks the door and pushes on it
But it won't give
she pushes on it again
It's locked from the other side
Shit
She turns to the staircase
- long, deserted country road
In the distance, a single flashlight beams ahead, the only light in the black night
Gale and Dewey can be heard
So is Dewey your real name
Dwight
Dewey was something  got stuck with a long time ago
like it
It's
sexy
Nah
it's just this town's way of not taking me serious
What about Gale Weathers
sound like a meteorologist
Gale and Dewey, walking closely, side by side- flirtatiously
Gale is surprisingly nervous
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism
don't think you're so bad
Gale smiles
Are all the local boys as sweet as you
Dewey blushes
He starts to say something when headlights appear behind them
They both spin as   loaded with  come racing right at them
Dewey grabs Gale and pushes her off the road
just as the cars speed by, oblivious to them
Gale lands face up with Dewey right on top of her
He steals a glance in her eyes before rolling off her
You okay
Something takes Gale's attention
What's that
Dewey looks to where gale points
He finds the flashlight and aims it into the bush
The tail end of a car is just visible
Looks like a car
Dewey helps her up and they move to it
He shines the flashlight on the plates but it's already obvious to the
This is the same car we last saw Sidney's father driving away in
Shit
It's Neil Prescott's car
Sidney's father
We gotta get back
Jesus
He's here
What the fuck is he doing here
Dewey is panicked
He grabs Gale and they race off down the road
- Randy continues to watch
He is now sloppy drunk, completely involved in the movie on the screen
, filling the room
(to ) No, Jamie
Look behind you
Watch out
Behind you
And if he followed his own advice, he would see the that stands directly behind him
knife poised
- Kenny finishes off a soda and crushes the can in his hand
He tosses it to the floor when a movement from the monitor catches his eye
is Randy, still on the couch, engrossed in the movie
Directly behind him
the
Kenny does a double- take
No fucking way
He watches as the  stands still, unmoving, knife raised
The  takes a silent step forward
(screaming at the monitor) This kid needs help
Kenny bolts out of his seat and goes for the side door
He slides it open and sticks his head out as
, comes at Kenny, fast and furious
slicing into his throat
Kenny falls forward
out the door as the    is upon him
just in time to see the    turn away from Randy, leaving him unharmed, moving instead, out the front door, on a thirty second walk to the newsvan
- The attic is long and narrow
cluttered with furniture, boxes, and the likes
moonlight filters in through a small raised window on the front wall of the house
Sidney moves through the attic
into this,  over that
she passes a dusty mirror, jumping at her own reflection
She cringes at her image, drenched in Billy's blood
She stares long and hard
something about the blood, the redness of it
She moves on, determined
She eyes the raised window above her
a way out
if she could only reach it
Gale and Dewey come running up the drive, frantic
'll call for backup
'll get my camera
They split up
The    as she rushes to the newsvan, throwing open the door
Kenny
Camera
Quick
The van is empty
Kenny
goes off
Gale spins around
It came from the patrol jeep in the driveway
(calling out) Dewey
She moves across the yard to the jeep, the door hangs open
Dewey is nowhere to be found
Dewey
Where are you
look of pure dread comes over Gale
- Sidney has stacked object after object building a ladder to the window
She climbs to the top, holding onto the window frame
She spots Gale almost immedietely
She  , looking for the window latch
But there's not one
It doesn't open
Sidney starts beating on it
trying to break it
- Gale, hanging tough, approaches the front door, unable to hear Sidney's  three floors up
Gale reaches for the door just as she hears ,   from just inside
She backs away
- -      through the empty living room as the horror movie on  comes to it's horrifying climax
Randy is now gone
- Gale races across the yard putting distance between her and the house
She moves back to the van
- Sidney has found an old tennis racket
She swings a solid forehand at the window
Sidney moves quickly, lifting herself up over broken glass and pulling herself through the window frame
Sidney wastes no time
She looks for Gale, , but Gale is gone
Sid lowers herself down the ledge, sliding down a sloped portion of the roof onto
'
Then she eases herself over the railing and lowers herself, letting herself hang as low as she can
then she lets go, free- falling the rest of the way
but in a split instant
grabbing her wrists in midair
Her body hangs, dangling against the side of the house
The begins to lift her, pulling her back onto the balcony
Sidney jerks, pulls, twists
but the  have her, hoisting her up
Sidney
yanking one last time, freeing herself
, a good seven feet, landing on her back, hitting hard
She grabs at a pained leg and brings herself upright
- Gale is frantic
She starts the engine up and hits the headlights when she discovers she can't see out of the windshield
Gale rubs at the glass
Sure enough, something is on the windshield outside, blocking her sight
Gale hits the wipers as across the glass, it drips down from above
Gale  as a  reaches in through the open window
she looks up to see
, staring at her madly
What's going on
sheer moment of fear as Gale hits the gas plummeting the car forward, into a ditch
She hits the
Randy is thrown forward, away from the van
Gale reverses, backs up, hits the brakes again
just as Kenny's face comes sliding down the outside of the windshield
eyes wide, face distorted, blood everywhere
Gale hits the gas, and yanks the wheel, sending Kenny's corpse flying off the top of the van
Gale spins the van around, onto the road, hits the gas madly, gaining speed just as
in the middle of the road, drenched in blood, very much resembling a young Sissy Spacek
Gale swerves to miss her, but she turns too sharp and the van veers off the road at top speed
flipping over on its side, sliding off into the thick foliage
- Sidney races to where the van lay on it's side
Sidney peers through the windshield
Gale's body lay limp and bloody
, turning, limping to the driveway
She sees the patrol jeep with it's open door
she goes for it
Sidney hops in, reaches for the ignition
Shit
Just then, Sidney's eyes go to the front porch
She watches as the front door opens and a  appears in the darkness, undetectable
Sidney throws the headlights
illuminating the front side of the house, revealing
Sidney opens the jeep door, moving to him, noticing his body, slumped, knees buckled
And then his body falls forward, slowly, deliberately, hitting the porch hard
Standing behind him is
Sid jumps back inside the jeep, closing the door, locking it
She reaches over and locks the passenger's door and then she
waits
And watches as the  leans over Dewey's still body, fumbling with something
Then the  stands upright, in his hands he holds
They jingle in the wind, the  toying with her, enjoying this
Sidney, hysterical, locks eyes with the  as he moves to the door, Sidney leaps on it, holding the lock button down, making it impossible to unlock
Her face is pressed against the glass
inches from the
She uses every ounce of strength when suddenly, the , dropping down, below the window, out of her view
Sidney moves to the center of the jeep, trying hard to listen over her own  , every sound
Then she hears it, the soft  of keys near the passengers side door
She pounces on the lock, holding it down
shadow cuts the beam of the headlights, unseen by Sidney
The lock turns on the other side
Sidney leaps over and holds it down, securing it
This is beyond nerve-racking
Sidney is certifiable
Her eyes spot the police radio for the first time
She grabs the mouthpiece and hits the switch
Help
Please
'm at Stu Maker's house on Turner Lane
Please, ' through front windshield
Sidney  into the police band
She doesn't see the
open the tailgate door of the jeep and slowly crawl in behind her
The   reaches out and grabs hold of Sidney's neck
Sidney, with surprising strength, spins around and attacks the She falls back against the dash, legs out, kicking wildly at him
Her hand reaches for the door, finds the lock, the door lever, she pulls
The door swings open
Sidney falls out of the door, hitting the ground
- Sidney, on her stomach, squirms away from the jeep
She brings herself up to her hands and knees, looking behind her to see nothing
Sidney's eyes roam the yard but he's nowhere
Completely gone
Vanished
Sid crawls to the front porch where
' Thinking quickly, precisely, she reaches to Dewey's holster and grabs his gun when a  ' behind her
(o
c
) Sidney
She turns to see Randy racing to her, limping
He appears stone cold sober
Jesus, Sid
We gotta get out of here
Sidney throws the gun forward
Stop
Right there
Don't shoot
It's me
Don't come any closer
Listen to me, Sid
found Tatum
She's dead, she's been killed
think Stu did it
He takes a step forward when another
(o
c
) Don't believe him, Sid
Sidney spins around to see Stu moving up the walk
He's lying
He killed Tatum
And Billy
Stu moves closer to Sidney
Stay away
She aims the gun in his direction
His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid
He's gone psycho
Don't listen to him
It's him
He's the one
Sidney has lost it, she doesn't know who to trust
She aims the gun at Stu
then Randy
then Stu
Come on, Sid
Give me the gun
No, Sid
They both move toward her
There's no time
She must act now
Finally
Fuck you both
And with that, Sidney steps back into the house and  the front door shut
/ Sid locks and bolts the door
From the other side she can hear Randy
,
'
His fists  against the door
Sidney, stumbling in the darkness, rushes to the phone in the living room
Just as she reaches for it
it
It scares the life out of her
She , yanking it up
Please
God
Help me
(from the phone) Having fun Sidney
Sidney falls apart,
She throws the phone down, disconnecting the call
Sid moves back to the door
'
She eyes the lock, deliberating
(at the door) Sidney looks up the staircase, into the darkness, her face to see
emerging from the shadows, stumbling down the stairs
Very much alive
Oh God
Billy
He's blood-soaked and dazed
Sidney meets him in the landing, grabbing him, holding him
thought you were
'm alright
Gotta
get
help
Billy goes for the door
He's out there
Randy continues    , (through door) Please, you gotta let me in
He's gonna kill me
Billy goes for the door
Sidney blocks him
Don't believe him
It's okay
Give me the gun
Sidney hands him the gun
Billy turns and unlocks the door, opening it
Randy rushes in, grabbing Billy, pleading
Help me
(calming him) Shhhh
It's okay
Stu's flipped out
He's gone mad
Slowly, a small smile creeps across Billy's face
"We all go a little mad sometimes
" Randy squints, confused, as Billy aims the gun at Randy and pulls the trigger
The  throws Randy's body against the wall before sliding to a heap on the floor
still
Anthony Perkins-- Who stands only feet away, face aghast
Fuck, no
this can't be happening
Billy's eyes are on her, unmoving
He sticks his tongue out and slowly licks the blood dried to his face
tasting it
Corn syrup
Same stuff they used for pig's blood in
Sidney is dumbfounded
Slowly, she takes a step back, moving into the dark refines of the kitchen
Billy, lurches forward in a fake-out, baiting her
She takes another step back--petrified
'
It is no longer familiar to Sidney
There is something inhuman now about his features
His expression is pure evil
She takes another step back, shrinking into the dark kitchen
as the outline of a  appears
She continues to back up, moving right into the arms of
Sidney spins around
her mouth open in speechless horror
Stu
please
help me
Stu stares back at her, eyes wide, lips curled in a subtle smile as he holds a small compact   up to his face
(whispering into phone) Surprise, Sidney
His  sounds affected now
the  of the killer
Sidney looks back to Billy, then to Stu, then to Billy again
It becomes all too clear
She stands between them, her mind racing, calculating
If for no other reason than to put space between her and them
they stand in the entryway, trapping her in
Where ya going
It's not over yet
We've got one more surprise--Stu,  believe it's your turn
Oh yeah Stu disappears into the kitchen
(to Sidney) What's wrong
You look like you've seen a ghost
Sidney stands, trying hard to hold a calm resolve
comes from the kitchen
low dragging sound
Stu reappears from the front hall
wrestling with something
someone
he has a body in tow, he thrusts it forward and it rolls into the living room
Sidney looks down to find
bound and gagged
His eyes wide in fear, very much alive
Daddy
She starts for him
Close enough
Stu places the cellular phone in Mr
Prescott's shirt pocket
Guess,  won't be needing this anymore
Why are you doing this
It's all part of the game
It's called   '
Fuck you
We already played that game
You lost, remember
You have to play, Sid
Don't want to disappoint your dad
He's been waiting around all night
It's an easy game
We ask you a question
If you get it wrong--you die
And if you get it right--you die
You're crazy--both of you
The official term is "psychotic"
You'll never get away with this
Tell that to Cotton Weary
You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him
Yeah, we just watched a few movies
Took a few notes
It was fun
Billy and Stu relish their madness, proud of themselves
Sidney looks to her dad, sees the tears in his eyes
She looks back to Billy, unflinching
a determined look on her face
Why did you kill my mother
Why
Did you hear that, Stu think she wants a motive
Hmmm
don't really believe in motives, Sid
mean, did Norman Bates have a motive
Stu plays along, shaking his head
Nope
And did they really ever explain why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people
Don't think so
You see, it's scarier when there's no motive, Sid
(fighting tears) don't understand
We did your mom a favor, Sid
The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something
(laughing) so we put her out of her misery mean, let's face it, your mom was no Sharon Stone
Stu cracks up over this while Billy turns very serious
Is that motive enough for you
Or how about this
Did you know your slut mother was sleeping with my dad and she's the reason my mom moved out and deserted me
sudden silence
Sidney is rigid with shock, his words resonant with truth
What
Even Stu is surprised with his seriousness
Think about it
On the off chance  get caught-a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think
You took my mother, so  took yours
Big sympathy factor
Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior
It certainly fucked you up
It made you have sex with a psychopath
That's right and now that you're no longer a virgin
You gotta die--those are the rules
Billy sits the gun down on the table near the foyer
And then moves to Sidney with the butcher knife in hand
Pretend this is all just a scary movie, Sid
How do you think it's going to end
Sidney doesn't respond
(excited) This is the best part, Sid
Billy's got it all figured out
Why do you think we kept your father alive so long
Why did we save you for last
You know what time it is, Sid
It's after midnight
It's your mother's anniversary
We killed her exactly one year ago today
Billy turns to Stu with the knife
They eye each other
Ready
Yeah
Billy pulls the knife back and brings it forward quickly, slicing into Stu
He stumbles to ho his knees,  in pain
Jesus
Sidney
as blood gushes
real blood, a dark, deep red
Stu inspects the wound to his side
then he smiles
Good one
My turn
He takes the knife from Billy
Don't forget-stay to the side and don't go too deep
Stu stabs at Billy's belly, puncturing him
Billy doubles over
Jesus
fuck, that hurt
Stop it
(squelching the pain) Got the ending figured out yet
Time's running out
Come on, Sid
Think about it
Your father is the chief suspect
We cloned his cellular
The evidence is there
Billy takes the knife and slashes at Stu's arm, two quick cuts
he doubles over
What if your father snapped
Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone
(in major pain) Except for me and Billy
we were left for dead
And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head
It's a perfect ending
Everyone dies but us
We get to carry on and plan the sequel
Let's face it, these days--you gotta have a sequel
Stu takes the knife and cuts at Billy
You sick fucks--you've seen one too many movies
Billy looks at her, bent over, crazed
Oh Sid, don't blame the movies
Movies don't create psychos
Movies just make psychos more creative
Stu staggers a bit
That's it, Billy
can't take any more
'm feeling woozy
Get the gun
'll untie Pops
Billy moves to Sidney's father
Where'd you put it
Stu is searching the foyer for the gun
It's on the table
No, it's not
Billy hobbles over
The gun is gone
Where the fuck is it
(off camera) Right here, asshole
Billy and Stu look up in unison to see
- standing in the front door way, gun in hand
Her body tattered and bloody
Her hair a mess
thought she was dead
She looked dead
Still does
Gale holds the gun firm, in total control
've got an ending for you
The reporter left for dead in the newsvan comes to, stumbles upon you two dipshits, finds the gun, fumbles your plan, and saves the day
Sidney steps forward
like that ending
Billy lunges at Gale, but she holds steady
Billy and Stu eye each other
She can't get both of us
Odds are--she'll miss anyway
In a mad rush, they storm Gale, heading straight at her
She pulls the trigger, but nothing happens
the safety is on
Billy charges forward, grabbing hold of the front door, It catches Gale in the face, knocking her backwards out the door
She goes down
out
Cool move
Billy steps out the front door and retrieves the gun from where Gale lays
Then he turns back inside the house to find
Where'd she go
Stu looks around, staggering now, bleeding heavily
Sidney has completely disappeared
Only her father, bound and gagged remains in the living
don't know Billy but 'm hurtin'
Where the fuck did she go
Suddenly, the phone
Billy and Stu look at each other
Completely surprised
Billy scrambles over to the phone
(picking up phone) Hello
(from phone) Are you alone in the house
Billy looks to Mr
Prescott
The cellular phone is gone
You bitch--where the fuck are you
Not so fast
We're gonna play a little game
It's called Billy looks around the living room
Find her
Billy is fuming now
slightly staggering
and starting to lose it
He  at Stu who has fallen to his knees
can't
'm bad off, Billy
You cut to deep
Billy throws the phone at Stu
He mouths to him, so Sid can't hear
"Talk to her
"  Then Billy takes off for the kitchen
Stu takes the phone
(aware) So Stu, what's your motive
Billy's got one
The police are on their way
What are you going to tell them
Peer pressure
'm way to sensitive
Billy flies back in the room, grabbing the phone from Stu
He's completely nuts now, staggering, bleeding, totally insane
( in phone) 'm gonna rip you up bitch
Just like your slut whore mother
Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy
Billy starts ripping the room up, overturning furniture in a mad fit of rage
when he notices the hall closet
Touche
He smiles deliriously, heading for it, ripping it open as
strikes from within, with an umbrella, the sharp end hitting him in the chest as it fans out
Billy stumbles back, stunned, as the  comes at him again
the umbrella lodges in his chest, and he goes down
Sidney rips the   off her head
She looks at Billy, disgusted, throwing the mask on Billy's now still body movement behind her sends her reeling around to find
slowly sitting up
His body drenched in blood
He's alive
barely
He looks to Sidney
through pain
You know what  hate most about horror movies
The final scene
it just goes on and on
and it gets so stupid
Randy manages to stand when a    at him, completely unexpected
it's Stu
barreling into him
they fall back into the living room
Sidney grabs the gun next to Billy and turns to the living room to find
Randy and Stu rolling across the floor in a dead lock, fighting, both seriously injured
Sid tries to find aim when a
of Sidney's ankle, toppling her to the floor
once again she finds Billy on top of her
Randy and Stu pound at each other, beating and clawing
as she fights viciously, attacking with everything she's got
Randy is desperately trying to pry away from Stu
he grabs hold of the television set and tries to pull himself off the floor out of Stu's clutch
His hands find the top of the
the
he yanks on it, gripping it with his hands, bringing it around with force- the  into Stu's head
Stu drops
as she digs her hand into Billy's open chest wound
He Her other hand brings the gun up to his face
but he head bunts it out the front door
suddenly a flash of silver appears above Sidney
Billy has grasped the butcher knife
he rises it high above Sidney ready to strike
when a bullet striking Billy knocking him back into the living room
Sidney looks up to see
, holding the gun in a death grip as smoke rises above the gun's chamber
Sidney sits up as Gale moves to her, helping her
Their eyes meet
life truce
- Billy and Stu lay face up, head to head
Sid and Gale move over them, staring down
Randy joins them
Sid, you found me out
'm a virgin
And pretty happy about it right now
Sidney nudges their bodies
They both stir
Careful
This is the moment when you think the killer's dead, but then he springs back to life for one last scare
Sidney grabs the gun from Gale
Not this time
She positions her foot on Stu's chest and aims
This is for my Mom, asshole
She  him in the forehead, a clean and perfect shot
The she aims the barrel at Billy who's eyes suddenly open, blinking up at her, blood bubbling from his lips
He's not yet dead
Their eyes lock
And this Billy stud-bucket is for having an incredibly small weenie
She  another perfect shot
They're both goners
Sidney drops the smoking gun, standing silent over the bodies quiet moment when suddenly
Both Sid and Gale and Randy  in epic, final scare proportions as Mr
Prescott leaps forward, still bound and gagged
Sid catches her breath, relaxing
Oh Daddy
She rushes to him, untying him
while Gale moves to the bookcase and retrieves the hidden camera
wanna close-up
Randy appears by Sidney's side, helping her untie her father
This is probably an inappropriate moment, but you think you'd want to maybe go out with me sometime
like on a date
Sidney looks at him, dumbfounded
Maybe catch a movie
long moment as Sidney's face goes from disbelief to resignation to the slight trace of a smile
Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie
You got it
He smiles at her
watching as Sidney grabs hold of her father, holding him tight as Gale Weathers, with camera in hand, gets one hell of an ending to this
