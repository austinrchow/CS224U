: 1
112 We slowly pan through a suburban neighbourhood located on the south shore of Long Island
The still shroud of night blankets the village of Amityville in the early morning hours
Appears: Thursday, November 14, 1974
Dissolves
Stray house pets are the only signs of life as families and neighbours slumber
We reach 112 Ocean Avenue, a large Dutch Colonial house
The home is a classic piece of Americana, two stories plus an attic, several rooms, and a boathouse on the Amityville River
There are quarter round windows on the top floor that give the appearance of eyes staring back at us
signpost in the front yard reads " ", a testament to what the home symbolizes for the family that live there
: 2
112 We move slowly through the basement, past various crushed beer cans and a table full of drug paraphernalia, until we reach a bearded man in his early twenties , known to his family and friends as
He sits on a ragged sofa, dozing off in front of a small Television that displays white static
There is a digital clock on a small table by the side of the sofa
It reads 3:14am
We hold on the clock and the time changes to 3:15am
We can see DeFeo's breath drift from his 3
lips as cold air sweeps through the room
His eyes snap open
hooded figure, face shrouded in darkness, steps from the shadows
The figure carries a
35 caliber lever action Marlin 336C rifle
Hands clad in black leather gloves, the mysterious person holds the rifle out in front of Butch voice emerges from beneath the hood that is so deep as to be : Kill them
Kill them all
Butch stands and takes the rifle
The figure retreats back into the shadows
: 3 The house is silent
Butch quietly stalks the hallways, the rifle grasped tightly in his hands
: 4 Butch quietly pushes the door aside and observes his parents as they sleep
, age forty three, is a heavy set Italian American man and his wife   is a slender woman, aged forty two, with flowing blonde hair
Both are lying flat on their stomachs
Without hesitation, Butch raises the rifle to his shoulder and pulls the trigger
The  is deafening
The first shot rips into his fathers back, tearing through his kidney and exiting through his chest
Butch fires another round, again hitting his father in the back
This shot pierces the base of Ronald Senior's spine, and lodges in his neck
Louise DeFeo's eyes open, but she barely has a few seconds to react
Butch aims the weapon at his mother as she lays prone on the bed, and fires two shots in quick succession
The bullets shatter her rib cage and collapse her right lung
Both bodies now lay silently in fresh pools of their own blood
: 5 Butch, in an almost trance like state, walks down the hall and quietly nudges the door to another bedroom
: 6
' Butch enters the bedroom that his two brothers , aged twelve, and , aged nine, share
He walks between their two beds as they lie on their stomachs, sleeping soundly
Standing directly above his two helpless brothers, Butch fires one shot into each of the boys as they lay sleeping
The bullets tear through their young bodies, ravaging their internal organs, laying waste to the lives that lay ahead of them
Mark lays motionless, while John, whose spinal cord has been severed by his brother's heartless attack, twitches spasmodically for a few moments after the shooting
: 7 Stangely, the loud shots have not roused the remaining members of the DeFeo family, and Butch skulks unchallenged to his final destination-the bedroom shared by his sisters , eighteen years old, and , aged thirteen
: 8
' As Butch enters the room, Allison stirs
She looks up just as Butch lowers the rifle to her face and pulls the trigger
Butch then aims his weapon at Dawn's head and squeezes the trigger again, literally blowing the left side of her face off
Both girls die instantly
The white sheets and walls are splattered with blood and brain matter
Butch is unmoved and expressionless
He surveys the carnage for a moment, then calmly walks out of the room
: 9 5
Butch walks past a photograph hanging on the wall in a red frame
It shows all seven members of the DeFeo family in a group, hugging each other with smiles on their faces
The sound of children singing the nursery rhyme "Ring Around a Rosie" in a slow, haunting manner echoes through the house
We push in on the photograph and: : 10 car drives through the village of Amityville on a cold winter's day
appears: ,   - 2013
Dissolves
: 11 young girl in her mid twenties is driving the car
She is attractive yet she dresses very conservatively in a thick sweater and baggy combat trousers
This is
She consults a crumpled piece of paper
Directions are scribbled on it
: 12 The car turns the corner and heads down a long driveway surrounded by trees
The car approaches a large imposing building which casts a dark shadow over the grounds
Outside a sign reads
: 13 Lisa is sat on a bench in a long empty corridor
She has a file in her hand and taps her fingers on it nervously door opens and a middle aged man dressed in a crisp white shirt and tie steps out
He is well groomed and his eyes are warm and inviting
This is
Lisa Templeton
Lisa stands abruptly, dropping her file in the process
Me
Sorry- Lisa scrambles to pick up the file and papers fall out of it
Shit
Mixter smiles
Oh God, 'm sorry,  didn't mean to say that
It's quite alright
'm Doctor Elliot Mixter
Come into my office
Lisa manages to retrieve the file and papers from the floor and compose herself
Mixter holds the door open and Lisa enters the office
: 14
' Lisa stands in the office
Mixter enters and shuts the door
Please, take a seat
Lisa sinks into a chair next to a large oak desk
Mixter walks to the opposite side and sits in a large leather chair facing her
've uh
brought my resume and some references
know  already sent a copy with my application but just in case
7
Thank you
Mixter takes the file from her and opens it on his desk
He glances over it
Very good
see you've had lots of experience cleaning private homes
Yes,  uh
've done a lot of them
Well an institution such as this one is a very different proposition
Oh yes
Yes  know
You'll see 've also worked cleaning a school, so am used to big areas
Yes 've seen that
When  say this is a different proposition  mean in terms of the sensitivity required due to the nature of what we do here
Oh yes, yes of course
You would mainly be working night shifts at a time when patients are on lock down
But many of our patients here have psychological disturbances so there may be situations where you have to clean up things you may not be used to cleaning up
If you know what 'm saying
know what you mean, yes
Would that bother you
It may be strange at first but actually have some experience in that area
would clean my mother when she lost control of her bodily functions during her illness
It's something  got used to very quickly
It became routine
see
How is your mother now
Well
she passed away
'm sorry to hear that
So
it's important to me that every employee here, whether they are a psychiatrist, an orderly or a cleaner, needs to fully understand what our mission statement at this hospital is
Okay
High Hopes was only built two years ago and as an institution we have only been running for just over a year now
So we're still building our reputation
But  am very clear on what  want that reputation to be
intend to make this institution one of the foremost centres for mental health treatment in the country
If you look into my history you'll know that  have a stellar reputation in the field of psychiatry and  want to use that to help others
That is why  have put my own money into the creation of this institution
We are only just starting out but we have a long term ambition to be considered the best
So what  require is that every person who works at this institution, in any capacity, must be professional and sensitive to the needs of the patients
Unlike other institutions, the welfare and care of our patients comes first here
9
really admire that and  promise would not let you down if  was given this job
'm sure you wouldn't
Lisa's face quickly contorts
Mixter looks puzzled
Suddenly Lisa sneezes
It shoots out so rapidly she has no time to cover her mouth and nose
She sneezes all over Mixter
Lisa looks horrified
Oh my God, 'm so sorry
Lisa rushes to Mixter's side and grabs a tissue from a Kleenex box on his desk
She frantically wipes the saliva and snot from his face
It's quite alright, please sit down,  can take care of it
Lisa, completely mortified, sits back down
An unimpressed Mixter wipes the spittle off his face with a tissue
When he's done he stares at Lisa
Okay
well thanks for coming in
'll let you know
Look 'm so sorry,  really am
It's fine
We'll be in touch
Such is her embarrassment, Lisa can't get out of the office fast enough
: 15
'  - Lisa is lying on her bed watching , flicking endlessly through the channels
The phone on the bedside table rings
Lisa picks up the receiver
Hello
10 (
) Hey hun
Hey Nancy
(
) How did it go today
It was a total fucking disaster
(
) Oh 'm sure you're just being silly hun
Whenever 've gone for an interview  always come out thinking it's gone really badly
But  bet it went better than you think
sneezed on the head of the institution
(
) You what
sneezed on him
It was one of those sneezes that just sneaks up on you,  didn't have time to cover my face
Before you know it he's covered in my snot
(
) Oh God 'm sorry hun
Long silence on the line
Go on, go ahead
You know you want to
(
) [ ] Laugh it up, it's gonna be your last chance because 'm not going for any more job interviews
'm done, 'm always so damn nervous and  just don't make a good first impression
11
(
) You should take my advice and show a little cleavage at these interviews
Trust me, you'd get the job then
That's just not me Nance wouldn't know where to start with flirting or any of that
Christ, if wore high heels to one of these interviews 'd probably trip over
'm a clumsy dork
(
) So what are you thinking of doing
dunno
Thanks for not disputing that dork remark by the way
(
) [Laughs] Sorry, hun
guess 'll have to sign on welfare to make the rent
Long term, maybe  should go back to school
Get better qualified for something
(
) How come you don't do something with your writing
You could try and get something published
Or write a book or something
dunno,  just
it's like  just haven't been able to bring myself to write since
you know
(
) know
It's a cliche, but time really is a healer
'm sure the passion you had for it will come back
Maybe
(
) You wanna talk about it
12 Not really
just think 'm gonna get myself a nice big tub of ice cream from the freezer and watch some
(
) Comfort eating
[Smiles]  know but if there's ever a good time for ice cream it's today
(
) Can't argue with that
Give me a call tomorrow, let's go for coffee soon yeah
Sure
Night
: 16
' Lisa is rummaging in her freezer for some ice cream
She pulls out a tub and tosses it on the counter
She opens the cutlery drawer and grabs a spoon
The phone rings
: 17 Lisa walks over to the phone and picks up the receiver
Hello
(
) Lisa this is Doctor Mixter at High Hopes Hospital
Really
Oh,  uh
Hi
(
) Hello
'm just calling you to say it was great to meet you today and 'd like to offer you the job
13
Lisa is stunned into silence
(
) Are you there
Um
is this a joke or something
(
) No joke, 'd like to offer you the job
Seriously
(
) Absolutely
Oh my God
can't believe it
(
) 'm pleased to welcome you to High Hopes Hospital
If you can be here at 9am tomorrow for an induction please and we'll go from there
Oh God, thank you so much
really appreciate this,  won't let you down
(
) know you won't
We'll see you tomorrow
Okay, see you tomorrow
Lisa puts the phone down with a smile
: 18
- Lisa enters the hospital
man in his thirties dressed in a boiler suit is stood on a step ladder
He is attempting to change a light bulb in the hallway but seems to be making hard work of it
The bulb drops from his hand and smashes to the ground
Lisa looks up at him
14 Gswno
Lisa averts her eyes but the man is now aware of her presence
He has a Polish accent but his English is very articulate
Can  help you
Yeah, 'm here for an induction into the cleaning job
You must be Lisa
Yes, that's right
Doctor Mixter said you would be coming
'm Delaney, we'll be working together
Oh great
Delaney climbs off the step ladder and shakes Lisa's hand
We work nights so today we'll just show you around, okay
Okay, thank you
'll clean this up and we'll get to it
: 19 Delaney opens the cupboard door and for a moment he and Lisa are silhouetted in the doorway
Delaney pulls a string hanging near the door and a light comes on
The cupboard is packed with various cleaning products
This is the storage cupboard
Everything you will need for each 15
task is here, each shelf is labelled
Okay
The most obvious task is hoovering
This is our hoover here, it's straight forward
You'll be surprised that although it's powerful it's very quiet, because we are working when everyone's in bed so obviously we don't want to wake them up
It has a Telescopic suction tube and six stage filter system
So a lot more powerful than you may be used to
Okay
The mop and bucket is here, we usually use standard bleach to mix with the water so that's straight forward
But there is this specialist stain remover that you must use if there are any stains on the floor or carpet
It needs to be sprayed and left to set for twenty minutes before scrubbing or mopping
It's a special formula for tea, coffee, water marks and other yellow and brown discolourations on the carpets or floors
It's pretty strong so wash your hands after you use it
One of the worst parts of the job is we have to remove chewing gum from lots of surfaces
They don't just stick it underneath the tables, it ends up everywhere
Gross
16 Yes
think a lot of the time it's the staff doing it, not the patients
But we have this GumCart, which is a bit complicated but it's easier than just scraping the gum
The steam is super heated to one hundred eighty degrees and delivered at seven point zero bar pressure
It can produce a hundred and fifteen litres of superheated steam per minute
Is it okay if  watch you use it a few times first so  know exactly what 'm doing
don't want to end up burning myself or any furniture
Delaney smiles
No problem
Now here we come to the most dangerous chemical we have
This is a concrete cleaner, very toxic stuff, so you have to wear the face mask and gloves we have here, okay
Okay
This is for cleaning and descaling brick, stone and concrete and for metal de-rusting
For concrete you must mix it one part to four parts water
Brush or spray it on with the equipment here then leave it five to ten minutes to set, then rinse it off
But for those stubborn son-of-a-bitch marks use it neat
Okay
Don't worry if anything seems complicated, you'll get used to it
But you'll mostly be mopping and hoovering in your first few weeks
17
Yeah that's fine
: 20 Lisa follows Delaney into the communal area of Ward
The walls are white and clinical
Various patients are scattered across the room, each with a look of resignation in their eyes
Many stare blankly out of the window
This is Ward , one of two wards you'll be responsible for cleaning each evening
Essentially the main duties will be emptying the bins, hoovering the carpeted areas and mopping the hallways
The patients in here are Category
They're mainly people who have had nervous breakdowns and those who are catatonic
They're harmless
Like Missus Hardesty here
Delaney and Lisa walk over to an old woman who is sat still in the chair
Her eyes are open yet she appears lifeless
Hello Missus Hardesty
No response or acknowledgement of other people's presence
She hasn't spoken a word in all her time here
The orderlies just lift her from the bedroom to the day room and back again every day
Why did you just talk to her
We've still got to treat them like human beings
Otherwise they just become like furniture and we all lose our humanity
like to think she can hear me, even if she won't talk to me
See you later Missus Hardesty
18 Missus Hardesty continues to stare into nothingness
Delaney and Lisa exit
: 21 Delaney and Lisa stroll down the long corridors
The patients are locked in their rooms on our night shift, but now and again they might have an accident we gotta clean up
Okay
In the day time there are nurses who often clean up but in the night we may be called to provide fresh linen or mop up
Not the most pleasant of jobs but it happens from time to time
Yeah  understand
Delaney and Lisa arrive at a doorway
Now here we come to the most difficult part of the job
Cleaning crap up isn't the most difficult part
Delaney smiles
Oh no, that's very easy compared to what's behind this door
What's behind it
This leads down to Ward
19
Sounds ominous
You could say that
It's where Category  patients are held
The criminally insane
Really
Doctor Mixter didn't mention that
Yes, well, these patients are beyond help so they've become athe hospital's secret
Many of them were transferred from prisons and other institutions
Doctor Mixter probably thought he could help them
He can't
The staff call this place Blood Row
Delaney opens the door
: 22 Lisa follows Delaney down a winding staircase
As they descend down the steps, the light fades
: 23 Delaney and Lisa enter a long dark corridor with a row of thick metal doors either side
Two light bulbs hang from the ceiling at each end of the corridor, providing only minimal illumination
Lisa's nose twitches
What's that smell
It always hangs in the air
No matter how much we bleach the floor there is always that smell of death
20 Lisa looks concerned
These patients are dangerous
Yes
But don't worry, we never have to interact directly or anything like that
You will just be mopping the corridor and dusting
Delaney walks over to the first door on the right
There is a hatch on the door
Delaney slowly slides it open and beckons Lisa over
She peers inside
The cell is very basic, white walls with the only furniture being an uncomfortable looking bed and a toilet without a seat
There are thick iron bars on one small window
skinny man in his thirties sits on a basic bed in a white vest, rocking back and forth
He has wild hair and a scraggly beard
That's Jerry Kimble
He was convicted of stabbing a young mother forty-nine times in front of her two year-old son, then killing and sexually assaulting a woman before smothering her four-year-old daughter
They call him the Green Chain Rapist
He was in Sing Sing but was certified insane and his lawyer got him transferred here
He doesn't make any noise or fuss, but he is a dangerous man
Especially towards women
This next inmate is even worse
Delaney slides the hatch shut and walks over to the next door
He slowly slides open the hatch and Lisa peers inside
Another basic white cell with only a bed and toilet
man stands in the centre of the room with his hands behind his back
His hair is slicked back, as jet black as the eyes that stare at Lisa
He smiles
Delaney slides the hatch shut
That's Dennis Palmer
Also known as The Long Island Cannibal
He was abused as a child so his targets were always paedophiles and rapists
He'd track them down and torture them
He would eat parts of their body while they were still alive
21
That's horrible
The most horrible thing is that a lot of the public thought he was a hero
Delaney walks over to a door on the opposite side of the hallway
He slides open the hatch
Sadie Krenwinkel
Lisa looks inside
Inside the basic cell a woman sits cross legged on her bed
She has long flowing black hair, intense eyes and a pentagram carved into her forehead
She looks up and smiles at Lisa
Delaney slides the hatch shut
What's her deal
She was a member of a Witchcraft cult
They kidnapped six people for a demonic ritual
Five were killed but one got away and led police to the cult
She turned her trial into a circus, talking about lots of crazy stuff
The media enjoyed it but she got certified insane by the court
She's been around a few institutions since
Now she's here
Some strange stories here
Well those aren't the strangest
Really
This last patient is the strangest case
Delaney walks over to the last door on the left
He slides open the hatch
singular shaft of light coming from a tiny barred window barely penetrates the darkness of the cell
Lisa peers inside to see a man sat in the shadows
This is our resident John Doe
Sometimes we have people with 22 amnesia
Often we find out who they are
Not so with this man
Why is he down here
They first brought him in about six months ago
No one knows where he came from, he literally just turned up late one night
An orderly found him wandering the grounds
First of all he was like Missus Hardesty upstairs-catatonic
Then a few weeks later he started to respond to Doctor Mixter and the nurses through facial expressions and gestures
But soon, he got violent
Very violent
He'd have bursts of rage and beat other patients
One day he appeared to have a seizure and collapsed
young doctor tried to take his vital signs
Patient here throttled him so hard he crushed his larynx
It took six orderlies to restrain him
Now they won't even let him out for the obligatory hour a day exercise
We still don't know who he is
Oh God
Delaney stares at Lisa
God has nothing to do with this man
Delaney slams the hatch shut
Lisa looks disturbed
haven't put you off have
guess not
it's just a lot to take in
've obviously never been around stuff like this before
This is the reality of this place
We don't deal with these people directly but we may have to clean up their mess
If you can't handle 23
that then  understand
You know that it's not too late to back out
Lisa considers for a moment
'm not a quitter
: 24 The hospital is bathed in moonlight
: 25 Lisa hoovers the carpet in the empty communal room
She then empties the bins
Clock on the wall ticks towards 3:15am
: 26 Lisa is mopping
As she reaches the end of the hallway a young girl walks around the corner carrying a teddy bear
Lisa is
Ooh, you made me jump
Should you be out of bed this late
don't know
The girl has flowing blonde hair and an angelic face, yet there is a haunting sadness in her eyes
don't think you should be
Do you want to play with me
'd love to sweetheart, but it's very late now
think you better go back to bed
24 Okay
The girl walks away
: 27 Lisa is returning the mop and bucket to the storage cupboard
She knocks a bottle off the shelf and leans over to pick it up
: Someone is approaching Lisa, edging closer and closer
hand stretches out and touches her shoulder
Lisa and  her head on the underside of the bottom shelf
Fuck
Lisa turns around to see Delaney standing there
Sorry,  didn't mean to startle you
It's okay
Lisa rubs her head
Are you okay
Yeah, just hurt that's all
Sorry
'll live
Do you want to grab a coffee
Sure
25
: 28 Delaney and Lisa are sat on a bench in the hallway sipping coffee from plastic cups
Did you change the bins in the Day Room
Yeah
Good
've got a light bulb to change in Room Twelve upstairs soon
We're making good time
Cool
It's funny,  never thought 'd get this job
The interview didn't go well
Doctor Mixter told me you were the only person he interviewed for the job
Really
Yeah
'm sure he felt you were right for the job and didn't need to interview anyone else
Cool
Lisa looks down at a distinctive tattoo on Delaney's wrist
Nice tattoo
Delaney pulls his sleeve down to cover it up
Oh yeah
forget  have it sometimes
26 What does it mean
Well
it represents a lot of wrong turns in my younger years
Like what
Delaney doesn't answer and takes a long sip of coffee
Sorry,  didn't mean to pry
It's okay
Let's just say the past is better left there
Fair enough
So how is the first night going for you
Not bad
ran into a young girl in the hallway earlier
Sweet little girl, she was only about twelve or thirteen
told her to go back to bed
guess they don't lock the kids in at night huh
Delaney appears confused
You sure it was a young girl of that age
Yeah definitely
She was carrying a teddy bear
She was about thirteen at the most
Umm
okay
What
Well
there are no children of that age here
27
Now it's Lisa who is confused
What
In fact, there are no children of any age in this place
think our youngest patient is about twenty
You're kidding right
No, 'm serious
Then who was that girl in the hallway
Delaney contemplates for a moment
You sure you saw a girl that young
'm positive
better tell the orderlies
This is no place for a little girl to be
: 29 Lisa is polishing a table
Delaney walks in with ,a well built man with a skinhead and visible tattoos on his arms
Did you find her
No
So you're the one who saw the little girl huh
28 Yes
You sure you saw a little girl
Of course
Well 've had to pull staff off other wards to search this goddamn place top to bottom
We found nothing
That's strange
big fucking inconvenience is what it is
Do me a favour, the next time you think you see something be absolutely sure before you go running to Jumpsuit here
ain't got time to be running around this place looking for shit that isn't there
You understand
Yes
Hardcastle exits
Lisa looks embarrassed
Sorry
Don't worry about it
Better safe than sorry
: 30
- Lisa walks tentatively down the staircase carrying a mop and bucket
clock on the wall reads 3:15am
: 29
31 Lisa walks into Ward
She looks down the dimly lit hallway and pauses for a moment
Overcoming her nerves, she places the bucket on the floor and starts mopping
As she edges through the hallway Lisa notices a light flickering from underneath one of the cell doors
She walks over and slowly reaches for the hatch
Sliding it open Lisa peers inside
In the centre of the floor she sees a needle, a piece of paper and a piece of red wool surrounded by Six lit candles
She looks around and nobody seems to be in the cell
Suddenly  jumps up right in front of the hatch
Lisa backwards, letting out an involuntary
She stumbles to her feet as Sadie laughs
Lisa slams the hatch shut and rushes towards the exit
: 32 Delaney is sifting through a tool box
Lisa stands in the doorway
Hey, can you do me a favour
What
Can you empty the rubbish in Doctor Mixter's office
've got to check the boiler, there's been complaints about the heating not working
No problem
Lisa grabs a roll of bin bags from the shelf
: 33
'  - Lisa knocks on the door
30 Doctor Mixter
Hello
She knocks again
No answer
Lisa tentatively turns the handle
The door slowly creaks open
The office is empty
Lisa walks in
: 34
' She looks around for the bin, finally locating it by the side of the desk
Lisa pulls the full bag out and ties it up before replacing it with a new bag
With her task complete, Lisa's curiosity gets the better of her
She looks around the office
There is a shelf full of psychology books and a filing cabinet
Lisa touches the top drawer of the filing cabinet and it opens
Lisa looks at all of the names on the files and finds one marked 'Patient '
She reaches for it and suddenly a grabs her shoulder
startled Lisa turns around
An orderly in his thirties is stood in front of her
He is thin but muscular, with slicked back hair
This is
What the hell are you doing in here
Uh
was just emptying the garbage
Funny,  don't remember Doctor Mixter keeping the garbage in the filing cabinet
Look
it was just open and
dunno
Well, y'know 'm gonna have to report this
Oh please don't,  didn't see anything  just opened it
Pemberton smiles
31
Well new girl, it's hospital policy to report this kind of thing
But 've only just got this job and really need it
Pemberton looks her up and down
Perhaps we can come to some arrangement
What do you mean
Well, 'd be doing you a big favour if  kept this to myself
So perhaps you can do me a favour
What kind of favour
blow job
Lisa's face contorts with disgust
You're disgusting
Lisa tries to leave the room but Pemberton stands in her way
Oh come on,  bet you'd love it
Look, you better get out of my way or 'm going to report you for sexual harassment
You've been working here for five minutes
You really think Doctor Mixter is gonna believe a fucking cleaner over a medical professional
Pemberton
32 Pemberton spins around
Delaney is stood in the door way
Leave her alone
Pemberton laughs
She ain't no prisoner here
was just talking, what's the problem
No problem
Lisa, come with me, we've got a job up on Ward
grateful Lisa brushes past Pemberton and exits the room
Delaney glares at Pemberton for a moment before leaving the room
Pemberton smirks
: 35 Delaney catches up with Lisa, who is a little emotional
You okay
'm fine
It was just a little bit intimidating, y'know
Pemberton can be like that
He works nights with that other son- of-a-bitch Hardcastle
They like to throw their weight around
You'll get used to it
People like that shouldn't be in charge of patients
Let's get a coffee
You sure love your break times
Delaney laughs
33
like to pace myself
Lisa smiles
: 36
: Passage from night to day and back again
: 37 Lisa is stood on a step ladder dusting in the hallway
She steps down and walks past a clock on the wall
The time hits 3:15am
Lisa walks into the day room and is  to see Mrs Hardesty sat in a chair
Missus Hardesty, you scared me
What are you doing up at this time
No response from the catatonic pensioner
Sorry,  forgot you don't talk
'll just go and get an orderly
Lisa heads for the exit
Missus Hardesty's head turns to look at her and her mouth opens
An unnaturally deep voice : You're going to die in here
Lisa stops in her tracks
She slowly turns to face Mrs Hardesty, who stares blankly into space
What did you say
Lisa stares at her but there is no response
'll
'll go get an orderly
34 : 38 Lisa walks down the hallway
At the other end of the corridor  and  are leaning against the wall having a conversation
Lisa approaches them
Hi
Well look who it is, Miss Sexual Harassment
Bite me
Hardcastle laughs
What are you laughing at
This one's got a big mouth
First ordering a search of the hospital for a little girl, now she's busting your balls
Look,  don't want any trouble just came to tell you there's a patient whose out of their room in Ward
You won't get no trouble from me, 'm a professional
Unlike this useless bag of bones
Fuck you
Hardcastle walks down the hallways with Lisa
He looks back at Pemberton with a shit eating grin
Catch you later sweetie
Pemberton raises his middle finger
35
: 39 Lisa and Hardcastle walk into the day room
The room is empty
Where is this patient huh
She was right there, in that chair
Who
Missus Hardesty
Missus Hardesty
Yeah
She even spoke to me
Hardcastle bursts out laughing
Missus Hardesty was here and she spoke to you
Yes
Just a second
Hardcastle steps out into the hallway
few moments later Hardcastle re-enters the day room with Pemberton
The new girl here says that Missus Hardesty was just sat in that chair
Says she even spoke to her
Pemberton chuckles
Look  know she's supposed to be catatonic but  swear she said something to me
36 That's not the strange thing, sweetheart
What do you mean
Missus Hardesty died this morning
The blood drains from Lisa's face
But  could have sworn
Listen newbie, how about you just get on with the cleaning and stay off the crack pipe
Okay, honey bunny
Pemberton and Hardcastle both laugh and leave the room
: 40 Lisa is sweeping in the hallway
She looks up and just catches a glimpse of someone turn the corner up ahead
Hello
Lisa looks around
The hallway is empty
She walks forward and turns the corner just in time to see the young girl, carrying a teddy bear, push open the door
She enters the staircase that leads down to Ward
Little girl, wait
Lisa drops her brush and rushes forward
She throws open the door
: 41 Lisa looks down and sees the young girl at the bottom of the staircase, heading for the entrance to Ward
37
Don't go in there
Lisa rushes down the stairs after her
: 42 Lisa pushes open the door to Ward
She peers down the dark hallway
The girl is nowhere to be seen
Little girl
Lisa slowly walks down the hallway, passing the cell doors
She can hear whispering
Lisa is drawn to the last door on the left
She approaches with caution
Stood in front of the door she slowly slides the hatch open and peers inside
John Doe sits in the corner, cloaked in shadow
Lisa peers down and in the centre of the floor, illuminated by a single shaft of light from the small window, is a
Lisa slides the hatch shut and walks backwards
She is seriously unnerved
As she steps back from the door she hears a whispering from Kimble's cell
She edges closer to his cell door and listens
(
) Palmer
Hey Palmer
Palmer can be heard from the next cell
His voice is calm, in stark comparison to Kimble's which sounds extremely agitated
(
) Yes
(
) My cock is so hard Palmer
It's so hard that  can't contain it any more
'm going to break through this wall and do bad things to you
Very, very bad
(
) must advise you Mister Kimble- threats will not be well received
(
) 'm touching myself Palmer
You wanna watch
You fucking faggot
38 (
) Stay out of my psyche Mister Kimble and 'll stay out of yours
Kimble starts to chuckle
Then he stops suddenly
Lisa leans closer to the cell door and she hears Kimble sniffing
Lisa jumps back as Kimble kicks the cell door
(
) know you're out there girlie can smell your pussy
How about you join me in here
Come on
Kimble bangs the door continuously
The racket echoes through the corridor
Sadie soon joins in, her and Kimble laugh maniacally as they thump on the doors
horrified Lisa rushes towards the exit
: 43
- ' An exhausted Lisa changes out of her work clothes and into a large t-shirt
The morning sun bursts through the window, filling the room with an orange hue
Lisa shuts the curtains and slides under the duvet cover into the welcome sanctuary of her bed
Lisa drifts to sleep
: 44
' Lisa is sleeping fast as night falls outside
All we can hear is the rhythm of her breathing and the gentle ticking of the clock by her bedside table
Suddenly her  snap open
We pull back and see that Lisa is now stood in front of
The doors open and she steps inside
45 Lisa enters a Church full of powerful religious imagery
On the right side of the entrance she notices a Font
drop of blood pierces the blessed water
As Lisa walks down the aisle we realise that everything has slowed to a crawl and she is moving in slow motion
White feathers cover the aisle, bouncing around her bare feet
An open Bible rests on the Lectern, the pages fluttering as if there is a strong breeze blowing them
Lisa looks up at a crucifix on the 39
wall, the contorted face of a crucified Jesus Christ stares at her
Blood seeps from the crown of thorns and runs down Christ's face
As Lisa gets closer to the altar she sees a female figure sat in the front pew
Lisa ebbs closer
The figure turns
It's '
' Don't you grieve for me
Of course  do
Suddenly tears of  run down Lisa's cheeks
Lisa's mother reaches out a hand
Lisa stretches her arm out to grab her mother's hand
Everything is in slow motion, it seems to take Lisa forever to reach her mother's hand
Suddenly a    grabs her outstretched arm
She turns to see a  , face shrouded in darkness, standing next to her
deep voice echoes around the church: Kill them
Kill them all
: 46
' Lisa's eyes  and she sits bolt upright
She is pale and soaked with sweat
It takes her a few moments to compose herself and realise that it was just a nightmare
: 47 The rain lashes down outside the institution
: 48 Lisa is walking with Delaney
Okay, next thing is mopping the floor in Ward
40 Umm
could you do that
Why
dunno
just need a break
Does Ward  frighten you
little
That's normal, it frightens me sometimes
But 've got to go up to a patient's room in Ward
Apparently they've had a little accident
Surely you wouldn't prefer to clean that up
Well
maybe not
know Ward  is a scary place
But you'll get used to it
can hear them talking
It's kinda unnerving
know,  hear that too when 'm down there
But trust me, once you get used to it things will get easier
: 49 The door creaks open
Lisa looks nervous
She walks in with her mop and bucket and heads to the end of the corridor
She begins mopping the floor
As she mops past Sadie's cell she hears a knock on the inside of the cell door
can hear you out there
41
Lisa is creeped out but she makes an effort to ignore it
She continues to mop the floor and starts moving past Sadie's cell
've been talking to your mother Lisa
Lisa stops dead in her tracks
She looks back at the cell door
She's here with me Lisa
She's told me all about you
Lisa walks over to the cell door
know you're out there Lisa
Talk to me
What
what do you expect me to say
Perhaps you can tell me all about the summer trips to Key West with your mother
Those were your favourite memories of your mother weren't they
Or perhaps you'd prefer to tell me about when you sat at your mother's bed side for six months, watching on helplessly as the cancer ravaged her body and sucked the life out of her
Lisa is horrified
She is shaking
How
how do you know all this
Because your mother is speaking to me from the flames of hell
You sick fuck
Tears stream down Lisa's face
She has a message for you Lisa
Want to hear it
42 Lisa wipes away the tears and tries to compose herself
Want the message
What is it
There is a pause for a moment before an unnaturally deep inhuman voice emerges from Sadie's throat on the other side of the cell door: distraught Lisa rushes towards the exit
: 50 Lisa rushes into the bathroom
wave of emotion rises to the surface and she sobs into her hands
After a few moments the tears subside and she takes a deep inhalation of breath, desperately trying to compose herself
Lisa walks over to one of the sinks
She looks at her tear stained face in the mirror above it
Lisa turns the tap on and water rushes out
She leans down and splashes the water on her face
Lisa looks up and is  to see her face reflected in the mirror as an
Lisa clutches her decrepit face in horror
She closes her eyes and opens them again
Her reflection has returned to normal
Lisa hears Sadie's maniacal chuckle echo around the bathroom
She rushes out
: 51 visibly upset Lisa rushes down the hallway towards Delaney
What's wrong Lisa
'm not going down to Ward  again, 'm really sorry  just can't handle it down there
43
Okay, just calm down okay
Tell me what happened
They say things to me through the doors
Horrible things
know, they've done it to me too
But that woman Sadie, she says things she couldn't possibly know about me
Like what
Lisa checks herself
sound crazy don't
Delaney smiles
No
This place just gets under your skin sometimes
'm starting to wonder if 'm losing my mind
Well it's not healthy to think too much about what those crazy son-of- a-bitches say
Believe me you don't want them inside your head
It's hard to keep them out sometimes
Listen, take a break from Ward for a while
'll go down there for the next week or so
'm really sorry about this, didn't think it would effect me so much
44 Don't worry, it gets to everyone at first
But the last thing  want is for you to dread coming to work
Delaney puts his hand on Lisa's shoulder in a comforting manner
Thank you
really appreciate that
Delaney smiles
No problem
: 52
: Passage from night to day and back again
: 53 Continual thumping on one of the cell doors echoes around Ward
Pemberton enters and walks over to Palmer' cell
He slides open the hatch
What's with all the fucking racket Palmer
Sorry to bother you Mister Pemberton
But  wondered if it would be possible to get some medical attention
Palmer holds up his arm and it's been slashed open
Blood pours from the wound
Now how the hell did that happen
Palmer holds up a makeshift knife
believe it was this rather crude weapon that did the damage
45
Jesus Christ Palmer
Now put the weapon on the floor and back away
Palmer obliges with a smile on his face
Pemberton unhooks a truncheon from his waist belt
Put your hands on your fucking head and face the wall
Now
Palmer willingly follows the instructions
Pemberton takes a set of keys from his belt and unlocks the cell
'm coming in dipshit, one fucking move from you and 'll cave your fucking skull in
You understand
As you wish Mister Pemberton
: 54
' Pemberton walks in with the truncheon raised above his head
Don't you fucking move
nervous Pemberton fumbles at his belt, trying to unhook a pair of handcuffs
Palmer slowly starts to back into him
said don't fucking move
Palmer moves faster
Pemberton swings for him but Palmer ducks it and spins around, pushing Pemberton into the wall knocking him to the floor
Palmer aims a swift and savage stamp at Pemberton's head
His skull crushes against the cold hard floor
Blood spatters all over the white cell
'm terribly sorry about this
Palmer reaches down, takes Pemberton's keys and exits the cell
: 46 55 Palmer stands at the entrance to Kimble's cell
He selects the key marked with the corresponding cell number
Palmer puts it into the keyhole and opens the door
Good evening Mister Kimble : 56 Hardcastle strolls down the hallway
: 57 Hardcastle looks down to the base of the staircase
Pemberton
Pemberton, what's taking you so long man
No response
Hardcastle rushes down the steps
: 58 Hardcastle enters
He sees the door of Palmer' cell open and slams a large red button on the wall next to the entrance
Hardcastle takes out his truncheon and cautiously approaches Palmer' cell
Looking inside he sees Pemberton crumpled on the floor in a pool of his own blood
Shit
emerges from the next cell
Hardcastle rushes over to Kimble's cell door
Five orderlies rush onto the Ward
We got a major code six over here
The orderlies rush to Hardcastle's side, truncheons at the ready
Hardcastle puts a key in the lock and prepares to open Kimble's cell
47
Stay alert
Hardcastle turns the key and kicks open the door
They are met by the sight of 's corpse positioned upright on the toilet
There is a hole in his head with part of his seeping out
Palmer stands next to him, with blood on his lips and a plastic spoon in his hand
He smiles, blood covering his teeth
Good evening gentleman
believe we will be one short at roll call tomorrow morning
Hardcastle and the orderlies charge Palmer
He doesn't resist as they viscously tackle him to the ground
: 59 Lisa is walking down the hallway
She hears a  emerge from one of the rooms
She puts her ear to the door and hears the  again
Lisa kneels down and peers through the keyhole
In a clinical white room Palmer is strapped down on a table
His face is severely cut and bruised but he is conscious
Four orderlies hold his arms and legs while a fifth smears conductor on Palmer temples
#1 Do we need to put the bit in his mouth
#2 No
We're not giving him the methohexital either
The orderly places electrodes either side of Palmer' head
He then turns the dial on the  device up to full power
Palmer  as he violently convulses, salivating heavily from his mouth
Suddenly the saliva turns to blood as he bites his own tongue off
Lisa is horrified as she watches the orderlies laugh as Palmer experiences a severe seizure
Shot: Someone is approaching Lisa as she crouches in front of the door
hand reaches out and  her by the hair, her to her feet
Lisa
She turns to see Hardcastle standing in front of her
He invades her personal space in an intimidating manner
What the fuck are you doing
48 just heard something so
was just curious
What are you seeing in there
Oh nothing,  didn't see anything
You make sure it stays that way
That guy is a fucking menace and he deserves everything he gets
So you don't talk to Mixter or anyone else about anything you've seen in there
You understand
won't say anything
Good
Now don't you got some cleaning to do somewhere
Of course
Lisa walks down the hallway
Hardcastle's eyes burn into the back of her head
: 60 Lisa rushes towards the entrance
She's running late
: 61 Lisa rushes inside, nearly knocking someone's coffee out of their hand in the process
She looks across the busy coffee shop and there's an attractive young blonde girl waving at her
Lisa rushes to the table
'm so sorry 'm running late Nanc
49
Don't worry about it, have a seat
latte yeah
Good, 've ordered it
They'll bring it over soon
Thanks
Lisa looks pale
Black bags under her eyes
God hun, you look like shit
Oh thanks
Sorry,  didn't mean to be blunt but you do
The night shifts getting to ya
The whole job's getting to me
My body clock's all out of whack but it's not just that
There's something seriously wrong with that place
What do you mean
waitress brings over the Latte and places it in front of Lisa
Thanks
Lisa proceeds to put four sugars in her coffee
Wow, you like a little coffee with your sugar
figure it'll wake me up a little
So what's wrong with the place
50 lot of things
The way they run things for starters, the orderlies are complete bastards
They usually are in those places
Some of the patients are extremely violent
You haven't been hurt by anyone have you
No, nothing like that
Some of the things they say though
it's pretty frightening
The weirdest thing is
Oh  dunno, maybe it's just me
wonder if 'm seeing things
What do you mean
think the place might be haunted
Either that or 'm losing my mind
Well  wouldn't be surprised if it was haunted
What do you mean
told my father about your new job
Yeah
Well, y'know they only built that Asylum a couple of years ago
Yeah
51
He says it was built on the site of One Twelve Ocean Avenue
What's that
You never heard of it
No
It was a famous house
Or should say infamous
Some guy shot his whole family there back in the seventies
Parents, brothers, sisters
Wiped out his entire family with a shotgun
Then the next owners of the house only lasted there about a month
They said they were driven from the house by evil spirits
The house became known around the world
That's why the recent owners sold the land, they had enough of all the media interest and constant tourists
Have you seriously never heard of the Amityville horror house
vaguely remember hearing some stuff a while ago, but  never really took it in
honestly didn't realise that the hospital was on the same land
Yup, right on the spot where the house was demolished
You really think the place is haunted
Either that or 'm going crazy
Well you're not crazy, hun
Perhaps the stories about hauntings at the house were true
Maybe the house is gone but the spirits stuck around
52 You believe in ghosts
dunno, never seen one
But  like to think 'm open minded
Plus you're the most intelligent girl know
If you say you've seen something,  believe you
Lisa smiles
Thanks Nanc
So what are you gonna do
Are you gonna quit
Part of me says  should
There's a lot about the place that frightens me
But  dunno
think 've seen too much to be able to just walk away and forget the place
If  was you 'd just walk away
Who wants to work at a place that frightens them
Well  need the money for starters
But now it feels like  need to find out more
Maybe you are crazy after all

' Lisa is sitting on her bed studying a laptop
On screen she : "Ronald Joseph "Butch" DeFeo, Jr

appears: November 1974

""   approaches him
Hey Pop
You come to help
'm going out
Again
Boy, you better not be turning up for work tomorrow like a goddamn zombie again
Yeah, yeah Pop
Don't yeah yeah me boy
You're on a last warning
seen you got Mark a wheelchair
Mom says it cost five hundred bucks
What of it
Well how come you're spending five hundred bucks on Mark and  gotta come beg you for money all the time huh
54 What's the matter with you, boy
Your brother's broken his leg, he needs that wheelchair
Well  need money too
Butch, you get a wage from the auto dealership every Friday and it's gone by Monday
Why is that
gotta live
What you spending that money on huh
Cos it ain't rent or food
You get everything you want for nothing 'round here
know what you're really doing with that money
You don't know shit
Boy, you better shut that mouth of yours
Ronald Senior stands there, axe in hand, eye-balling his son
This ain't over
Butch storms back towards the house
Ronald Senior brings the axe forcefully down on a piece of wood, splitting it cleanly in half
: 64 There is a knock on the door
pale looking man in his twenties opens the door to reveal Butch standing in the door way holding a brown paper bag
Hey Mick
55
Butch,  told you man, you can't get no shit on lay-away any more
Your credit's all used up
Butch pulls a wad of money out of the paper bag
You accept cash
Mick smiles
My man
Come on in
: 65 Butch uses a lighter to boil a spoon full of heroin
On his right arm is a belt
He then loads the heroin into a syringe
Butch tightens the belt and taps his arm
He sinks the needle into a prominent vein and plunges the heroin into his blood stream
His eyes sink and he lies back onto the crusty carpet of the apartment, staring up at the ceiling
From a bird's eye view we slowly move down towards Butch
Suddenly a chorus of voices chatter around his ears
#1 (
) It's kill or be killed
#2 (
) Why haven't you killed that pig
#3 (
) They are plotting against you
We have decided that you must take action
#4 (
) Kill them
Kill them all

Suddenly a large hand  the back of his jacket
Butch swipes the hand away and spins around to see his father red with rage
56 Nineteen thousand dollars boy
Nineteen thousand
What
You stole that fuckin' money from the auto dealership
What the fuck you talking about was robbed
Didn't Brigante tell you huh
Some fuckers car jacked me Pop
told the police about it
You expect me to believe that, boy
You think 'm fuckin' stupid
ain't saying your stupid pop, 'm telling you the truth
was robbed god-damn it
Ronald Senior grabs Butch by the scruff of the neck and him against the door
rushes in
What the hell's going on
Our son's a fuckin' junkie thief, that's what's going on
He robbed the fucking dealership
Don't listen to him Ma,  ain't done nothing
Ronald Senior and Butch fall to the floor and start grappling
Stop it
Stop it now
Louise attempts to pull Ronald Senior off Butch
Her nails dig into her husband's neck and draw blood
An enraged Ronald Senior grabs his wife's arms as she starts to slap him
Butch scrambles to his feet and rushes down the hallway
Ronald Senior remonstrates with Louise who is still trying to slap him
57
Why do you always have to get involved huh
You've always been too soft on that boy
Don't you touch him
He needs some fuckin' discipline
Stay away from him
Suddenly Ronald Senior feels cold metal pressed against the back of his head
Louise  and steps back
Ronald Senior freezes
Ronald Senior slowly turns to see Butch, his eyes bloodshot and his face emotionless, aiming a at his head
've had enough of you fat man
Ronnie, don't
Please
Ronald Senior's trembles with fear as he stares into his son's cold eyes
Butch places his finger on the trigger
No
Butch pulls the trigger
Louise
The gun
Ronald Senior breathes a sigh of relief
Butch lowers the gun and storms off towards the basement
Louise embraces Ronald Senior, who appears to be in shock

112 Butch is quietly stalking the landing
He can hear whispers from his parents' bedroom and cranes his neck to listen
(
) want him out of this house tomorrow
He's gone
(
) guess you're right
He's twenty three now, he just doesn't belong here any more
58 (
) His age ain't the problem Louise, those goddamn drugs he's taking are
'm not having that going on under my roof

) We'll talk to him tomorrow

' Lisa scans down the web page and looks at photos of Butch DeFeo and his family
Suddenly she reaches a picture of 13 year old Allison and her blood runs cold
She recognises Allison as the little girl she encountered in the hospital hallway
: 69 Lisa and Delaney are sat on a bench in the hallway drinking coffee
Do you know the history of this place
59
There's not much history
We've only been open a couple of years
No,  mean the history of the land
You mean
what was on the land before the hospital
Yeah
know a bit about that
One Twelve Ocean Avenue
The Amityville haunted house
Well  don't know that it was haunted
Lots of people think that's lies
know about the kid that killed his family
That's true
didn't know about it until a friend told me
Really
It's a famous case
How come you never mentioned it
You seem spooked already
didn't want to make it worse
'know why 'm spooked
Because of the patients on Ward
It's not just that Delaney
think this place is haunted
In fact, 'm sure of it
60 You've seen something
Remember  said  saw a little girl roaming the hallways here
know who she is
She's one of the DeFeo children who were killed
You ever seen her
No
Honestly
To be honest  don't believe in all that ghost stuff
Well  wasn't a huge believer, but know what 've seen
believe that you've seen something
Some people are more open to that kind of thing, y'know
But me
'm closed off to that extra terrestrial stuff
Extra terrestrial is aliens
Whatever it's called,  don't know
So what do you believe in
Do you believe in God
Serious questions tonight
'm just curious
Why do you ask
It's something 've been thinking about
How can evil exist in a 61
world that many people believe was created by a loving God
don't believe that God is a bearded man who lives in the sky
Or that the Devil is a red demon with horns
believe God and Satan are within all of us
God is our human side
Satan is our animal side
Whether we become good or evil depends which side of us we feed
It's a frightening thing to believe that if God exists he is not powerful enough to stop evil
Free will in the hands of a person who feeds the Evil inside them
That's what frightens me
Lisa ponders for a moment
Doctor Mixter must have known what stood on this land before the hospital
Of course he did
He bought the land and organised the demolition of the house himself
Why would he build on this land knowing the history of the place
He's not superstitious
He's a doctor, they don't usually believe in those things
Amityville is full of local legends, going back even before the DeFeos
Like what
There's stories about the Native Americans being slaughtered on this land many years ago
Some people 62 even believed the Indian Chief possessed that kid who killed his family
Really
don't think that's true
If 've learnt anything from the patients on Ward , it's that some people have a mind that works in a different way to other people
Those people who do bad things have fed the evil within them more than the good
It's not possession, it's sickness
Sickness of the soul
don't know what to think
Just don't let your imagination run away with you Lisa
You're a person who feeds that good within you
Don't let this place feed the evil
: 70 Lisa enters the Library
She approaches a stuffy looking middle aged woman with glasses perched on the end of her nose
Hi, sorry to bother you but my name's Lisa Templeton
rang yesterday to set up a meeting with Gloria Branco
Yes, that's me
Oh great
Thank you for agreeing to meet with me
No problem, nice to meet you
've set up a table in the back
've 63
got a few books that may help you with your inquiries
Thank you, that's great
Lisa follows Gloria to the back of the Library
: 71 Lisa and Gloria are sat at a table in a secluded corner of the Library
Various books are spread out on the table
So you wanted to know about the history of Amityville dating back to the Native Americans
Yes that's right
'm writing a college paper and  had heard some rumours in the neighbourhood about Native Americans being killed on the land down on Oceans Avenue
Gloria's demeanour instantly turns from jovial to serious
Well that area has quite a dark history
You mean the DeFeo murders at One Twelve
Yes
Terrible business that
Those young children
Breaks my heart to think about such a tragedy
Yeah it's awful
You know most of the town was very upset when they decided to build that mental institution on the land
That used to be a nice suburban neighbourhood, now there's this big eye sore there
We had a 64 thousand names on a petition
But guess that Doctor who runs the place has enough money to pay off the people in high places
So what about the native Americans
Is that story about them being killed on that land true
There's something on that here
Gloria flips through one of the books
Ah yes, here it is
(Reading) In the 18th Century there existed a group of Native Americans in Amityville known as "The Satchem Tribe" led by Satchem Takapausha, the Chief
The tribe had fled Salem in Massachusetts to escape persecution by the Christians who were persecuting members of the tribe because of their Witchcraft practices
These practices included a ritualistic human sacrifice of six people (The significance of Six being related to the biblical number of man and creation) in order to induce the spirit of their God, The Dark Master, who they believed manifested his powers through his devoted followers, giving them immortality
The hundred strong tribe settled in Amityville but were later chased off the land by local Christians
Satchem accused the Christians of not properly compensating his tribe for the land
war started and the Christians hired a hunter called John Underhill from Salem
At the site where One Twelve Oceans Avenue was later built in Amityville, Underhill killed all of the tribe
The Indians were buried in a mass grave on the site
Before he died Satchem vowed revenge
According to local legend, Chief Satchem is believed to have subsequently haunted the land
Various parapsychologists and mediums have 65
claimed that Satchem's vengeful spirit influenced the 1974 DeFeo murders at One Twelve Oceans Avenue and the haunting of the subsequent owners
Although such assertions are widely disputed
So the legend has basis in historical fact
Absolutely
: 72 Lisa is sat with Delaney, both nursing a cup of coffee
You told me the other night that you think evil is within us all
But do you think that people can be influenced by an evil that comes from outside of themselves
Are you still thinking about this
guess  am yeah
worry that you're thinking too much
This place is getting to you
There's something going on in this place
Something sinister
And don't just mean the patients on Ward
Have you not noticed that
've noticed some things
Why haven't you said anything
Or done anything
66 Delaney contemplates for a moment
It's like the honey bee
What do you mean
The honey bee is fine when it's just flying from flower to flower
Then they think that a person is a threat and they sting them
They might leave a sting but the person will recover
The bee dies
So ask myself
is it worth it
Delaney returns his attention to the cup of coffee in his hands as Lisa disappears into her own thoughts
: 73
' Lisa is sat in an armchair with a laptop resting on her thighs
On screen she is reading a Wikipedia entry: "The Satchem Tribe was a tribe of Native American origin that existed in the 18th Century
They fled Massachusetts and settled in Amityville where they were ultimately murdered over a land dispute
The Tribe was renowned for practices in line with Witchcraft and worshipped a God called The Dark Master
In 2009, it emerged that a modern cult incarnation of the tribe existed
They have adopted the traditional beliefs of the Satchem tribe but the modern followers are not required to be of Native American origin
" Lisa scrolls down to the References section
She clicks on a link
Blog appears on screen entitled The Dark Master: An Ancient Vision for  Modern World
She reads the latest Blog : "Our time is at hand
On November 13th 2013, 6 souls will be sacrificed so that The Dark Master's devoted followers may be blessed with immortality
As non-believers perish on doomsday the Master's loyal subjects shall live on and be bestowed with great power and responsibility for the direction of the New World

The first result is a Wikipedia entry
Lisa clicks on it
She reads: "Sadie Krenwinkel is a convicted murderer and former member of The Satchem Cult, a modern incarnation of a Native American tribe who practiced Witchcraft in the 18th Century
In 2009, Krenwinkel led ten members of the cult to 1005 Dennison Drive where they subsequently tortured and murdered five individuals
One potential victim managed to escape and lead police to Krenwinkel
At her trial in 2010, Krenwinkel outlined the beliefs of the Satchem Cult, claiming the human sacrifice of six individuals would have given them immortality
As a result her lawyer submitted a plea of insanity and Krenwinkel was subsequently sentenced to indefinite incarceration in a mental institution
" Lisa reads further down the page and notices that the name of the Doctor who testified to her insanity at her trial: : 74 Lisa rushes towards the hospital
: 75 Lisa enters Ward
She walks down the hallway and bangs on Sadie's cell door
know what you're doing
No response
've seen that blog
How are you getting access to the internet
Lisa slides open the hatch and looks inside
The cell is covered in lit candles with Sadie sat cross legged in the centre of the room
Are you allowed to have all this stuff in your cell huh
68 The Dark Master is near
It's too late to stop it now
Tonight will behold a great becoming
What's going to happen
You're planning on a human sacrifice aren't you
All good things to those who wait
Tell me
Sadie stares directly at Lisa with intense eyes
An unnaturally deep voice escapes her lips: Our time is at hand
Lisa slides the hatch shut
She walks over to the last door on the left
Lisa slides the hatch open and peers in
The resident John Doe sits in the shadows
Suddenly he sits forward and a bright shaft of daylight illuminates his face
Lisa is shocked to see a face she recognises from the internet article staring at her
The face of  "" Lisa slams the hatch shut and backs down the hallway, her mind racing as fast as her pulse rate
: 76 Lisa knocks on the door to Doctor's Mixter's office
(
) Come in
Lisa pops her head inside
Doctor Mixter
Oh Lisa, Hello
What brings you here
69
just wondered if  could speak to you for a moment sir
It's very important
Of course, come in
: 77
' Lisa enters and sits down opposite Mixter, who is sat behind his desk filling out a form
What can  do for you Lisa
Well
what 'm going to tell you will sound really strange but need to tell you
Okay, go ahead
Do you know the history of the land the hospital is built on
What are you referring to exactly
Well, first of all
The DeFeo murders and the infamous house that people said was haunted
am aware of the DeFeo murders yes
The hauntings
well  think it's common perception now that a lot of that was exaggerated by the media
Maybe
Are you aware of the history of the land dating back to the eighteenth century
No,  can't say that  am
70 There were a group of Native Americans in Amityville known as "The Satchem Tribe"
They were massacred by Christians after a dispute over the land
Okay
'm sure there's a point to all this
Yes
Sadie Krenwinkel down on Ward She shares the beliefs of the Satchem Tribe
have reason to believe that somehow she has access to the internet and Witchcraft paraphernalia and she's planning on a human sacrifice tonight to try and raise the God she believes in, The Dark Master, and become immortal
Mixter chuckles
'm serious
Have you been reading up on Sadie
It's rather outlandish stuff isn't it
But  can assure you she has no access to the internet or anything else
Go on the internet and check out the Blog
She signs herself Sister Sadie
Well that could be anyone called Sadie couldn't it
Go down and search her cell
don't believe that will be necessary
The patients on Ward spend twenty three hours a day in the cell
They get an hour of exercise in a small yard guarded by six of our staff
There's no way 71
that any of those patients have access to the internet or any paraphernalia
Then someone is helping her get access to this stuff
Someone who works here
Please Doctor Mixter
Just check out her cell and speak to her
If 'm wrong about this and it's all just her delusions then fine
'll accept that
But  had to tell you
You testified at her trial didn't you
Yes  did
What are you implying
Nothing
just meant you know how dangerous she is
Yes,  understand how dangerous she is and  appreciate you coming to express your concerns
One thing you need to bear in mind Lisa is that there are some very sick patients at this institution
We do our best to help those who can be helped but unfortunately the patients on Ward  are beyond help
Their personality disorders are too advanced, their delusions are too grandiose
worry that perhaps you have been rather taken in by one of those delusions
know that it might sound like that
But can you check her cell and speak to her
Look at the blog on the internet, see if you can connect the  number of the writer with a computer here at the hospital
Okay look
That does take time and resources  don't necessarily have
But as you've come to me with a concern of patient infraction and potential threat of violence,  am duty bound to investigate
72 Thank you
In fact, 'll order a cell search immediately
Stay here for a moment, 'll be right back
Mixter exits
Lisa leans forward and a file on the desk catches her eye
She stands up and reaches over for it
Her is on it
Lisa opens it up
Inside is a form Committing her to the hospital as a
Lisa looks down and the reason stated is
The date on the form is November 13th
Today
Lisa slams the file shut and the office door opens
She turns to see Mixter stood there with Hardcastle and another orderly
What the hell are you doing
This is for your own good Lisa
You need treatment
The orderlies approach her
Lisa lashes out but the two men overpower her, grabbing her arms and then tripping her
She hits the floor with a thud
Mixter produces a syringe from behind his back
This is for your own good Lisa
Fuck you
Mixter plunges the needle into her neck
: Lisa looks up at Mixter and the orderlies and we
: 78 Lisa awakens, sat in the corner of a cold white cell
She tries to get up before realising she's strapped into a straight jacket
Lisa
The hatch opens and Mixter peers in
The hatch then closes and the door opens
Mixter enters
Let me out of here you sick fuck
73
Now Lisa, let's talk calmly or you will be sedated again
Mixter walks over and sits on the edge of the bed
Why are you doing this
You're having paranoid delusions
'm also aware that you've been having disturbing visions
'm not having delusions,  know what 've seen
Well you think you know
The human brain is a powerful thing and 'm sure you do believe what you've seen
But it's all in your mind Lisa, it's not reality
You're a very sick girl and you need treatment
You do this to all your staff huh
The minute we speak out we get fucking committed
Staff
You were never staff here Lisa
You're a patient here
You've always been a patient here
Lisa appears confused
No, no
You're lying to me,  know who  am
'm afraid not my dear
You've always been with us here
Initially as an out patient but now the delusions have progressed  feel it's time for you to become a full time resident
74 Lisa becomes upset
Tears stream down her face
But
but
Look,  understand it's a lot to process now
'll leave you to think about it and then we'll begin counselling sessions tomorrow
Okay
Lisa sobs
Listen, how about  take this straight jacket off so you're more comfortable
Thank you
First you must take this
It will help you sleep
Mixter hands Lisa a red pill and a bottle of water
She takes the pill and pops it in her mouth before taking a gulp of water
Good girl
know it's a lot to take in but together we'll get through this
Now 'm going to take your restraint off
Remember though, if you're violent then promise you it will go straight back on
Okay
Okay
Mixter unties the straight jacket at the back and lifts it off
That better
Yes
Thank you
75
No problem
'm going to leave you get some rest now
Tomorrow we start the healing process
Mixter exits
The echo of the steel door closing reverberates around the tiny cell
We hear Mixter's footsteps as he walks down the hallway
Lisa's upset demeanour disappears immediately
She spits the red pill into the palm of her hand

The lock of the door turns
Patient 's eyes snap open
The door opens
Mixter is stood in the doorway, dressed in a hooded black robe
He holds the Marlin rifle in his hands
He approaches Patient  and holds out the rifle and a box of shells
Patient  takes them
Mixter walks out

He punches in a combination of numbers and all of the doors unlock
Patient  is stood in the doorway of his cell, rifle at his side
Sadie rushes out of her cell and sees him
broad smile spreads on her face
She turns to Mixter
We did it Elliot, we did it
Our time is at hand
Immortality is ours
Patient  raises the rifle and squeezes the trigger
The rips through the back of Sadie's head, blowing half of her face away
She is killed instantly and her lifeless corpse drops to the floor
Mixter smiles and leaves the Ward

84 Lisa has her ear pressed to the door
She can hear and
She starts to panic and rushes over to the small window
She slams her hand into the window but the glass doesn't break
The lock on the door snaps
Lisa slides down the wall, terrified
The door opens and  walks in
Lisa breathes a huge sigh of relief and rushes over, throwing her arms around him
We need to get out of here
One of the patients is running around with a shot gun down on Ward

The lobotomised Palmer is lying face down on his bed
Patient aims the gun and a  tears through Palmer' back
Hardcastle and another orderly rush onto the Ward
Patient takes aim and shoots Hardcastle in the chest, killing him instantly
The other orderly turns to run and is  in the leg
: 86 Delaney and Lisa run through the Ward
They turn a corner and are suddenly confronted by a large group of patients in white gowns
Fuck
Delaney and Lisa run back the other way and turn the corner
Two orderlies, brandishing truncheons, are approaching
Please help us
The patients are loose
#1 We'll take care of them
78 The orderlies turn the corner and see the large group
The orderlies look at each other, fear in their eyes
They turn to run but the patients overpower them in a flash, grabbing and scratching, deep wounds tearing into their skin
Delaney and Lisa look on as the helpless orderlies
Shouldn't we help them
We need to save ourselves
Let them reap what they've sewn
Delaney grabs Lisa and they run down the hallway, as the patients beat the orderlies with their own truncheons
: 87 Lisa and Delaney rush down the hallway
They turn a corner and are stopped in their tracks by the  of stood in the centre of the hallway clutching a teddy bear
She has a  bullet hole in the centre of her forehead, blood dripping down her face
Why don't you want to play with me

Lisa and Delaney rush back down the hallway

They burst through a door
: 89 Lisa and Delaney find themselves in the shower room
Mould covers the walls and all of the showers are on, gushing dirty water
They spot another door on the other side of the 79
shower room but blocking their path to it is a thin middle aged man in a white vest and white shorts, facing the wall
He is whispering to himself
Lisa and Delaney stop
Hey mister, you need to get the hell out of here, there's a patient going crazy with a gun
The man turns around
His face is weathered and his eyes are wild and bloodshot
My
my skin's on too tight
What
My skin is on too tight
Delaney grabs Lisa and they start ebbing past the man towards the door
The man is getting increasingly more agitated, scratching at his face
My skin's on too tight
The man reaches into the pocket of his shorts and produces a scalpel
My skin is on too tight
The man  his cheek with the scalpel
Lisa
The man drags the scalpel around his face in one continuous motion, blood seeping from the circular gash
As Lisa and Delaney watch on in horror the man  the skin off his face, exposing muscles and veins
His white vest and shorts are now saturated with blood
The man sighs with relief
That's much better

They're locked
Delaney fumbles for a set of keys
Come on, hurry, please
Delaney finds the right key
He checks the lock and realises that a key has been snapped off in it
Kurwa
What, what

Delaney rushes to the reception desk and grabs a chair
He rushes over to a window next to the door and raises the chair

She tries to lift the window
After an unsuccessful attempt at opening it she realises the window is nailed down

Everything is quiet
Suddenly the door as Patient   on it
The door cracks as Patient against it
Lisa crouches down with the knife at the ready

Patient  leans through the hole, peering down at Lisa crouched on the floor
He aims the gun through the hole and prepares to fire

The blade  through Patient 's right eye
He  and drops the gun in the cupboard before stumbling backwards into the staff room
Patient  clasps his hands to his eye which is now gushing with blood

He looks at Allison and they share a peaceful smile
Allison walks with Patient  through a doorway filled with a blinding
They disappear and the light slowly dissipates

- Lisa, covered in blood, walks through the hallway with the rifle by her side
She reaches the door to Doctor Mixter's office and kicks it open
Mixter is sat behind his desk, now dressed in his usual shirt and tie
Lisa aims the gun at Mixter whose hands are beneath the table
Get your fucking hands up you sick fuck
: Mixter presses a red button beneath the desk
Mixter raises his hands
see we've dispensed with the usual pleasantries
Come in Lisa
Lisa enters, kicking the door shut behind her
83
: 97
' Mixter is very calm
Lisa is trembling, the rifle visibly shaking in her hands as she aims it at Mixter's head
You gonna tell me it's all in my head now huh
Wanna tell me 'm the crazy one
Well maybe it is, maybe it isn't
How would you know
Get the fuck out of my head you son-of-a-bitch
know who  am and know what 've seen
You're part of all of this
know you are
You're the crazy one
You're the one holding the gun on a well respected doctor, my dear
Why did you do this
Why
You are part of a great becoming tonight
rising of The Dark Master who blesses all of his followers with power and immortality
You fucking believe that do you
Sounds like a bunch of bullshit to me
You're no better than those fucking fundamentalists who kill innocent people because they've twisted shit they've read in some Holy book
It's all shit
The plan for the becoming is almost complete
Just one more sacrifice, that's all we need tonight
84 How about if  blow your fucking head off then huh
Suddenly  can be heard outside
The screeching of car wheels
Mixter smiles
Lisa, still holding the gun at Mixter, shuffles over to the window and peers through the blinds
The car park is full of police cars
dozen armed police officers rush towards the building
Lisa looks back to see Mixter chuckling
What the fuck are you laughing at
It's all falling into place
The cops coming here
'm gonna tell them everything about you and your little sick plan
They're gonna lock you up and throw away the key
If you say so
Outside they hear the police rushing down the hallway
Tell me something Lisa, would it help your grief over your mother if you knew she was a slut
What did you say
Yes
That's why she's burning in hell
Lisa, her teeth clenched, moves forward and places the business end of the rifle against Mixter's temple
You shut the fuck about my mother, you don't know anything
know that sometimes you wonder why you don't cry enough for her know you feel guilty for not doing more for her when she was alive
You feel guilty for moving on with 85
your life and forgetting about her
have not forgotten about her
Face it Lisa, you never cared for her
You never cared for anyone but yourself
She's looking up from the bowels of hell now knowing that you never loved her
Tears stream down Lisa's face
She's crumbling
She was a whore
Lisa  Mixter over the head with the butt of the rifle
He falls to the ground and looks up at a crazed Lisa
Your mother's in hell and you don't care
Fuck you

Her body is riddled with  and she falls to the floor in a blood soaked heap

: 86 98 glamorous woman addresses the camera
And we're back with our next guest
year ago he was a survivor of the High Hopes Hospital mass murder when cleaner Lisa Templeton ran amok with a rifle, claiming six victims and injuring many others
Doctor Elliot Mixter has written a new book entitled 'Shattered Hopes' which provides an account of that fateful night as well as some background into the mind of the murderer
Doctor Mixter, good morning
Mixter is sat opposite, in a very expensive suit
Morning Katherine, how are you
'm good thank you
So Doctor, can you tell us a little more about the book
Well, it features a blow by blow account of the evening
It was obviously a very harrowing experience and for me it was rather therapeutic to deal with my feelings about what happened in writing
How has it affected the hospital Doctor
Obviously we were all left very numb by events for a long time and know a lot of people in the town felt we should close the institution
But that never occurred to me
feel that people should be brought closer by tragedy and the Staff and  have definitely become closer, both as colleagues and friends, since the incident
That bond makes for a better 87
institution in my opinion, so we will continue to go from strength to strength
You mentioned there that some people wanted the place to close know many were also resistant to the opening of the institution in the first place given that it was built on the site of the infamous house, where Ronald DeFeo murdered his family in the seventies
know a lot of people associated with that case were accused of exploiting it for their own ends
You've also faced some criticism for that, particularly as we heard last week that you have sold the movie rights to this book
How do you respond to that criticism
Well  know that some people accuse me of hurting the memory of the victims but  feel 'm helping the memories of those involved live on
Granted, some victims were criminally insane but other victims were loyal staff who had families and 'm determined that they not be forgotten
Each staff member gets their own chapter in the book so that the readers can get a full picture of what wonderful people they were
always say that all forms of media, whether it be books, newspapers,  or movies, are a preservation of life
Our physical bodies may die but our images live on when we are famous
Our work and our passion is preserved, therefore it's as if our souls are preserved
Through all of these forms of media we are, in effect, immortal
Mixter looks straight into the camera and smiles
88 The sound of children singing the nursery rhyme "Ring Around a Rosie" in a slow, haunting manner echoes around our ears
