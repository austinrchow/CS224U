Death, destruction, fear
All images taken from the previous ten Friday The 13ths
,
: The year is 2455
The place is Old Earth
Barren, void of life, a hazardous and violent planet
The sky is blood red with spiked clouds of dark gray
It is beautiful, but frighteningly foreign
as several figures rush through a below
Small groups of people, wearing thick dusters, goggles and masks, work nearby
Some dig in the cracked earth, others take assorted readings with strange devices
This is an archeological expedition
: The dust storm rages outside
Two figures are looking closely at a small object buried in the dirt
One of them pulls a device out of their pouch and slowly, gently picks up the object
The other uses a magnetic tool to remove the dirt
Careful
know
They take off their masks and goggles
They are both young female (17) watches as  male (18) studies the object closely
(reading) Not guaranteed, if used After 2198
of the object
It's an unopened condom
(smiles) You thinking what 'm thinking
Stoney tosses the high tech equipment over his shoulder and rips open the condom as Adrienne rips her clothes off
They are in a half buried mini-van
It rocks violently from the raging storm outside and from the raging lust inside
(breathless) What about Kkinsa
is desperately trying to take off her bra
It's over between us
You're the only one for me
They fall some ten feet,   down on top of them
rusty metal ladder
Debris everywhere
Half inch layers of dust cover everything
Dead
Lifeless
You okay
Adrienne sits up, shines her light down the long metal corridor
She turns her light on  then sees something over his shoulder
We  , out of the tunnel, through the van as the sounds of the storm drown out '
: The digging and readings have stopped
group approaches a time scarred shuttle and begin loading their packs into the cargo belly
(40), rail thin, possible female, pilot, appears at the top of the shuttle ramp
(yelling over the wind) Let's go
Time to load up
(33), a professor of archaeology lowers his veil
(yelling) 'm missing two
Shit
Temp's dropping
We should have left this rock an hour ago
(eyes a device) North three clicks
: - - and the rest of the group run into view
(18), husky, physical; holds out a device and checks the reading
He points to the rusted out mini-van sitting on its belly
(yelling) There
(30), bulky, short on temper, rushes up wearing futuristic military garb - Yo, Teach, what the fuck
We're missing two of the kids
Get your ass back to the shuttle
'll check it out
moves past the group and into the Van
Not without me
The rest of the gang look at each other and climb into the Van
and the others climb down a rusted ladder
Metallic walls, graffiti, cluttered floors
No Stoney or Adrienne
sign from the ceiling states - They all take off the goggles and masks
The rest of the group consists of (18) good looking, smart ass; (17) sexual, scheming (17) , ; (16), insecure, problematic; (17), a nerd but doesn't know it
Amazing
But, how
've been coming here for ten years
We never picked this up on our
-
- 14, a cybernetics science droid, removes her veil
She's gorgeous, but there's something off about her look
Something synthetic
- 14 The air's laced with type two ozone, it reads as a solid
Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden
- 14 In twenty-eighty-two many of the survivors moved their facilities underground to escape
All right, all right, enough with the history lesson
Lets find these two quick
so  can kick some little punk ass
Kkinsa shines a flashlight around the dark tunnel
have an idea, why don't you go find them and we'll get the hell out of here
turns and finds herself face to face with - - Easily two-hundred years old it hangs from the wall, impaled through the forehead by an iron spike
Kicker yanks a weapon from his back, locks and loads as falls back and lands in the lap of another corpse
She screams
- 14  at the top of her lungs
Everyone looks at the droid
- 14 Was that out loud
Thorgan, have you been screwing with
grabs the head off the , with the spike through it's head
Cool
This is an automatic ""
Azrael dumps the contents of his bag on the ground, an old boot, some cds, and an ancient box of
starts shoving the corpse into his pack
've got my project
What are you losers gonna do
Back to the shuttle
All of you
'll find them
Relax, Soldier boy, this is amazing
These remains are two hundred years old
Yllo's light hits a sign hanging from the ceiling
Creepy
Cool
Okay, 'm outta here
Kay-Em, any thoughts
- 14 Girth is better than length and women prefer a shaved scrotum during oral sex
Yllo glares a Thorgan
'm trying to give her some personality
Well stop messing with her
don't want a science droid with a personality
Now let's find them and get back
want to get clearance to stay back and study this
No way
'm not staying here any longer
have a life you know
radio crackles
(
) Hey teach
This rock's starting to freeze
Get your ass back hre
(into radio) Keep your shirt on
'm working on it
You won't believe what we found
(calls out) Adrienne
Stoney
Yllo rushes past the corpse
The others reluctantly follow
They pass another hanging sign - Danger - , it's torso separated from it's legs
And this is just the beginning
As they move down the corridor there are bodies everywhere
There was a hall of a battle down here
they move further they break a laser beam
sparks fly sounds
Dan-danger
Do not enter-er
But the group keeps moving
feel compelled to ask why we are ignoring that
corpse lies on the floor before them, it's skeletal hand beneath a warning written in ancient blood
Suddenly another   at them, screaming like a banshee
Everyone  - It lands on Kkinsa, who totally freaks trying to get the corpse off her
and  help Kkinsa fight the rotting corpse
They hear hysterical laughter and look up to see - and
emerge from the shadows laughing uncontrollably
Damnit
What the hell are you two doing
Kkinsa eyes Adrienne, then glares at Stoney
You're toast, mister
You're both toast
You gotta see this
They turn down the right corridor, passing beneath ceiling consisting of a jumbled mess of jagged metal
(re: ceiling) That's a strange design, don't you think
We don't have time for this shit
As they pass we see a section of the jagged metal ceiling twitch and squeeze together
That can't be a good thing
and Adrienne stop at a huge metal door
Above the door
Adrienne points to a small window in the door
Yeah, so
had Cryo 101 last year
Check it out
With a smirk, Adrienne wipes the condensation from the small window in the door
Drawn from the inside, in blood, is a final warning - So don't open the door
Look beyond it, yesterday's news
Yllo pushes his way to the window
Shocked faces
the blue tinted room we see a huge domed Cryo cylinder
It's massive, but our attention is pulled to the corner of the room
Curled up into a ball, is a body - female, young
Is that
- 14 The room's still operational
She's perfectly preserved
Yllo's face lights up, grabs his radio
(into radio) Fat Lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates
Call Grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century
Now wait a minute
don't think you should open that door
This is a science excursion corporal
Just stay out of the way
Yllo turns to the kids
He's very excited
Okay, no screwing around
This is the real thing
Do exactly what  say
Okay Thorgan, open it up
Thorgan pops the cover from a control panel and hooks up a small gadget
You're opening the door
What about the
She points to the skull and crossbones
'm thinking we should call in some experts
This is your find people
You want to give your credit away
was just saying
The cryo unit leaked
The computers sealed the room
No airborne viruses no hazardous materials
've shut down the until
Alright, stand back
- 14 Hold your breath
Initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious
Knock you on your ass pal
They don their face masks as
Fshhhhhshshsh
The metallic door cracks open causing a powerful backdraft
The freezing cold air mixes with the air outside the chamber creating a strange gray gas
Ice crystals crack and fall to the floor
Kay-Em
Kay moves into the room ahead of the others
-' They are not human
Mechanical, digital, but alluring
They dilate, open up
Colored lasers shoot forth, slicing through the gas, scanning the body
--which itself is slumped over
An icicle of frozen blood from, the wound in her shoulder, props the body up
The other enter the icy chamber
speak on behalf of the group when  say
that's fucked
- 14 Female, nineteen years old, eight months
34-26-34
bitch is built like a brick shit house
Thorgan
Sorry
'll fix her when we get back
- 14 Time of hibernation 2049
Crystallization at seventeen percent
Suggest extensive Nanotech
Chances of rejuvenation eight-one percent
What's going on
She's dying
Bitch looks dead to me
The
(
) Yllo, Sergeant Brodski
Get your ass back to the shuttle
Janessa, stretcher
(into radio) Keep your shirt on, sergeant
We have a medical emergency here not tot mention the discovery of a lifetime
(
) Kicker
Get them the hell out of there
Janessa removes a Metallic cube from her backpack, clicks a button and a flat stretcher expands and hovers a few feet off the ground
Kicker grabs Yllo
We're outta here
Yllo pulls away, leans over the frozen girl, grabs the frozen string of blood and --breaks it off
Fine, grab that end
Kicker sighs and helps Yllo lift the frozen girl and place her curled body on the stretcher
As thorgan stands at the massive Cryo-Unit - Hey check this out
Protruding from the door is the tip of a machete
This caused the leak and there's an occupant
Thorgan yanks the door open
Don't touch that
Gas rolls out
Suddenly   and
This is bad, no
Relax, it's only a  glitch in the system
First field trip and you think you're a Scientist
Move out of the way geek
moves to look inside the chamber
As the gas and steam clear - we hear the sound of  , see a jagged mass of frozen crystals
and within it
a body
chunk of ice  and falls tot he floor then   of looms forward
screams as ' , stiff as a board,  to the ground sending ice shrapnel everywhere
Jesus, used to make the suckers big didn't they
Again, Kay-Em's eyes scan the frozen body
- 14 Subject was dead prior to incubation
Yllo moves to get a good look at Jason
My God, look at him
Why would they freeze a dead body
(a beat) Alright, load him up, and let's get out of here
- pair of three foot metallic spiders drop on thin wires to the floor
One of Boeman's gadgets starts to
Er, guy
'm picking up some movement
Azrael screams as a laser slices into the room
His left arm falls to the ground
Kay-Em rushes to him
Her finger pops open
needle appears
She injects him
The drugs take immediate effect
Cool
check out my arm
- , , ,
The metallic spiders, lasers attached to their bodies,  towards our heroes
Kicker
Defense droids
'm on it
Kicker slams the Cryo door shut as lasers slice into it
There goes prom night
Kicker clicks at a gadget attached to his forearm
They're only class two
can handle this
No problem
Not a problem
Kay-Em injects him again
'm missing a fucking arm heeeerrrr- (re:shot) Oh, that's dreamy
The lasers begin strategically slicing through hinges
Okay rent-a-cop, do your shit
gotta date tonight
Stand back
He pulls a gadget from his pack, punches in a series of buttons
We have to get these two back in one piece
Kay-Em turns to the frozen girl
- 14 Subject is critical
Needs nano stabilization immediately
Kicker
Do something
Oh Gawd
wish it would stop doing that
At her feet, Azrael's arm twitches spastically
(drugged up) That is soooo cool
Kicker cracks the door and tosses his gadget
Come on
Kicker throws open the door and starts
Yllo and the kids follow him into the hall, the two stretches in tow
They disappear around the bend - towards the exit
beat then
screaming
They run back into view
Behind them - - , , , ,
dozen laser wielding spiders make chase
Some are old and rusty, other slump over and short out, but those that work
work well
Kicker is running backwards,  with his weapon
Lasers all around our group
Have  told you guys how much  hate this class
We need another exit
'll hold 'em off
Teach, find a way out
'm on it
Sorry kid, leave this to the pros
(re: gadget) Left at the end of the hall
laser strikes the body of Jason Voorhees, breaking off a chunk of ice
(reading from device) They're not after us
Their sensors are locked in on
him
Thorgan points to '
Leave him behind
No
He's coming with us
They round a corner
Here
We're one meter from the surface
Then duck
-
he cocks his grenade launcher and fires at the ceiling
Rocks and falling debris reveal the violent surface above
It's too high
Kicker rolls around the corner and starts blasting
Make it happen
They're just subclass  droids
'm so not impressed
Stoney, you catch
Stonet leaps, grabs the lip and tosses his feet up and over in a very acrobatic move
Boeman kneels, cups his hands to make a step
He begins tossing his friends up to Stoney as Kicker makes war in the hall
Soon, Boeman and Kicker are the only two left
We're clear
Let's go
Boeman leaps up, grabs the lip and pulls himself to safety
He spins around and holds his arm out for Kicker
Kicker leaps, grabs Boeman's hand
Boeman strains to pull him up as spider's cover the floor below them, then - spider crawls up Kicker's leg - a spike shoots out into Kicker's thigh
He screams
They've got me
Let go
No
Boeman  and pulls harder
Kicker's pack  from his body - the spiders falling with the pack
- The sand storm is raging on the surface
Kicker lands on top of Boeman
That wasn't so bad
Kicker bites the pin from a grenade, tosses it into the hole
(yells) This will be
The others dive for the ground as -  - rises up out of the hole
Nice touch
And you said high school was boring
Our team fights the winds and rushes up the ramp of the waiting shuttle
is waiting at the ramp
He looks at the two stretchers
Oh my God
what the hell is
Just get us to the ship
Azrael stops in a panic
Oh shit  forgot my arm
Here
Dumbass
She hands him the severed limb as they race up the ramp
The door closed, the      and soars into the sky
: - maneauvers through the junk that now floats in orbit
Old satellites, the front quarter of a Space Shuttle, etc
Navigating through the debris,   grabs a radio mike
This is Beowulf approaching from sector fifteen
Through the front windshield we see - - , a class  Catamaran Transport
It looks like two huge torpedoes attached by three thin walkways
Not new, but by no means old
(
) 've got you, Beowulf
Proceed with docking
And by the way, Brodski's pissed
The shuttle doors open revealing   and six - standing with weapons at the ready
As the group gather their equipment and begin to move the two stretchers, Brodski stepsi n front of
What the hell were you thinking
ignores him, turns to his team
Get them in the lab
Not so fast Yllo
There's a protocol here
The - Grunts step in front of kids
(to the grunts) Back off
(back to the kids) Get them to the labs
Now
The team moves through the Grunts
What the hell are you doing
Brodski looks down at the stretcher with the young woman's body on it
My god
This is way over your head, pal
We need to call some experts and
am an expert
You're a teacher
Brodski 'll talk slow so you can understand me
She's thawing
If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head
What if they're carrying
Did you even check
- 14 Subjects scan virus clean
Brodski attempts to shove Kay-Em out of his way
she stands her ground
grabs his crotch
- 14 Mmm, you like the rough stuff don't you, big boy
Brodski and Yllo look at Thorgan
Thorgan
Sorry
'll fix her
promise
How do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesn't carry something metal tits can't detect
Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her
Damnit, Yllo
don't like it
don't give a shit
This one's prime for decryonization
We're brining her back
still think we should send for a team of real scientists
am a scientist you asshole
This could be the most important discovery in 400 years
Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean
Right now,  care only for the safety of this crew
You don't know anything about these two - The stretcher with  moves by them
Brodski looks down
Jesus what the hell is that
That's exactly what we need to find out
Check your orders, Sergeant
out rank you where discovery is concerned
Now step aside
have a medical emergency to deal with
Reluctantly, Brodski steps aside
As the kids follow, Azrael bumps into , one of the -
Azrael glares at him, brandishing the severed limb
Watch it punk, 'm armed
Punk
Dallas slaps Azrael across the back of the head as he passes
You'll pay for that
Dallas and the grunts laugh
: and , a synthetic pilot existing only from the waist up in his pilot's chair, set course for home
Gravitation nominal
Thrusters engaged
(into radio) Grendel to Grendel's mother, we are enroute
' (
) Copy that, Grendel
Computer ovverides deployed
See you in two days
: Dark, quiet, until the lights glare on
doubles as a Medical Research center and Sick Bay filled with some of the strangest creatures ever seen cover the back wall
Yllo and the students bring the girl in
Their movements are hurried and economical
but they're excited
Get her prepped for the soup
(to Adrienne) Take the other one to lab two
Yllo, this is my find
My project
want to be in here
know, dear, but this is too big a discovery
need you to prep the second body
But,  want
This is a discovery that we will all share
We have to work as  a team
Now go
Stoney go with her
Thorgan and Delongpre lift the Girl onto the rejuvenation table
Stoney whispers something to Kkinsa before he exits with Adrienne
Kkkinsa nods and wheels a huge   over to the Girl
She starts the scan as Delongpree and Thorgan cut the clothes off their "find"
Have  told you guys how much  love this class
Delongpree brushes some of the melting crystals from her face
She's beautiful
Thorgan cuts her shirt off
Damn
Talk about your hard nipples
Adrienne and Stoney push Jason into the lab
is smaller and less high-tech than  one
They shove ' body onto the
Fucking Yllo
Thinks he can push me aside
This is my find
She removes chucks of ice from '
You know even though we both found this guy , 'll let you take the credits
You can take it from here
Oh thanks
fine go
It's just another dissection
You'll only get in my way
Cool
Besides, you're into this shit
Stoney leaves Adrienne alone with Jason
and he is
Yllo walks around the room, overseeing all the action
He's excited and cocky
Hands on training is rare
You should consider yourself lucky
Lucky
Azrael sits in a large machine
This is
The - 2000
It can repair non-fatal injuries with the use of Nano-Technology
Azrael is scanned by the -2000 and so is his injury
It goes into action as articulated mechanics begin to re-attach his arm
Another hour and 'd have lost the arm
Oh, was that the hand you beat off with
better get extra credit for this shit
Delongpree, Status
How you doing
Delongpree cuts her underpants from her body and tosses them over his shoulder
(swallows hard) 'm Okay
Well she's definitely a blond
Oh that's scientific
You think all girls from the past looked this good
She's not that great
400 years
bet she'll be horny
Okay, people, we need to Learn everything there is to learn about our two guests
And if all goes well, 'll mention each one of you when  make my nobel prize speech
(underbreath) Yeah, right
Delongpre presses a button on the table
The edges of the table to create a clear dome around the table
hot gel-like substance shoots out of small tubes
The   is covered in the -
Thorgan checks a monitor
Everything looks good
Yllo smiles - gushing self-satisfaction
Turn up the heat
Adrienne is wearing a metal eyepiece while staring at a computer screen
No hands
Done
Crystallization remains seventeen percent
Adrienne scans Jason with a machine identical to the one Kkinsa was using in
Crystallization at sixty percent Subject classification
deformity
Put it on the screen
monitor lights up with a scan of Jason's body
The internal organs are distorted and bloated
She keys into the next lab
Back to lab one
(
) (over speaker) Guys, check out beef-cakes scan
Jason's 3- scan appears on one of the big monitors
(
) Look at the brain
Within Jason's skull is a brain the size of a golf-ball
It's just like Thorgan's
What do you think this means
Thorgan grabs his crotch
This is what it means right here
Small brains make your balls itch
And what's with the headgear
- 14 The mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty-twelve
Hockey
- 14 medieval sport where two teams club one another with elongated sticks
Very sexy
What do you expect from a culture that sucked its planet dry of resources
She eyes Stoney
He smiles knowingly
This bores me
She's red
Body temp 98
6
This is so cool
Prep defib and start the cell reconstruction
- 14 presses a series of buttons
long needle punctures the '
Jason's scan is replaced by the girl's
We see Nanotechnology going to work replacing her wounds and damaged cells
Cool
Kkinsa and Stoney back out of the room unnoticed
Is she stable
- 14 Subject is stable and cell reconstruction has begun
Now what
We wait
need about fifteen
Call me if there are any changes
If she farts  want a full report
Don't  deserve a sick day or some shit like that
Yllo exits
: ' The door swishes open
Stoney enters with Kkinsa close behind
Kkinsa raises her hand
Adrienne
Of all people
You're jealous
Stoney moves back
Kkinsa moves close hand raises above her head
Adrienne
It's over between us
You're the one  want
Kkinsa grabs the back of her shirt and pulls it over her head
Bed
bed slides out from the wall, hitting Stoney in the back of the legs, causing him to fall on the bed
Kkinsa straddles him
Stoney grabs her
The two fall into a feverish kiss
: Adrienne is prepping various medical tools
'  is laying on an autopsy table
Steam rises from his body as thick ooze drips from his thawing flesh
She turns on a computer monitor
Prepare organ vats
Two metal sinks hiss as liquid nitrogen flows
Okay big boy
She picks up a long, sharp chrome tool and walks over to Jason's body
(continuing) let's see what you're made of
: ' Yllo enters and approaches a computer console
The door behind him opens
Janessa enters
All this science shit, makes me horny
(removes her shirt) Take off your cloths, we don't have much time
She drops her shirt to the floor
Yllo retrieves it, hands it back
You're quicker than usual
Later
You prefer an apple
He forces her into the hall, closes the door, locks it
He returns to the console
(to console) Secure line
Perez, Joshua, Solaras Space Lab
Connect
-
huge cylindrical ship, floats quietly
We hear a  sound
- Joshua Perez rolls over, clicks on a light
He fumbles for a button, presses it
wall monitor lights up revealing Yllo's face
You son of a bitch, you know what time it is
We just left old Earth
You'll never believe what we found
Yllo inserts a disk into the console
'm sending you the files
(testy) Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari
Trust me
'm bypassing regular channels
See what kind of payday we're looking at
(begins download) Alright, 'm
(reacts to file) No way
is this a joke
Yllo smiles
: Adrienne leans over '  body
Oozing goo drips from the slab
She is inches away from his steaming mask
She taps it with her tool
She begins working at the straps of the mask, cutting the overgrown flesh away
' Yllo studies a monitor
On screen: a document entitled, He talks on the secure line
Hypothetically, how much are we talking
(
) If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone
Doesn't include touring and guest lectures
When can you get them here
'll reset our course
3 hours
(
) See you then
doctor
Yllo's face glows with thoughts of fame and fortune
: ' Janessa has hooked up a small device to the door
She's heard every word
' Kkinsa rips off Stoney's shirt
Stoney grab her and rolls on top of her
'  - it curls, the frozen joints
Adrienne turns from Jason's mask
large wad of goo hits the floor
She turns back to her work
Slicing flesh away from the mask
' Stoney and Kkinsa kiss passionately as they wrestle to get each other's pants off
Adrienne tries to pry the Mask off
but it holds firm
She stick s a long sharp tool into an eye hole
We hear disgusting noises as she probes '
She removes the tool, and on the end is Jason's eye
Holding it close she looks at it
It is bloated and distorted
She drops it in a specimen jar and takes it over to her work station
' Kkinsa rolls on top of Stoney
She holds his arms down as she whispers in his ear
How bad do you want it
Stoney gets his arms free and rolls on top of her
'
Adrienne turns again, then approaches
Interesting
Record
Thawing has caused possible muscle spasms
She frowns at the disgusting ooze
mixture of swamp waters, blood, and other thawing bodily fluids, puddle around Jason's body
She moves back to her work station and picks up '
She takes out an autopsy laser and cuts through the center of the eye
The laser slices through the fatty tissue as thick black goop drips out of the eye
Adrienne stares into a microscope
This is all very interesting
' Stoney lies on top of Kkinsa
Yes
yes
that's it
a moment, then both  as he enters her
sits up
on  as she studies the dripping eye
She puts the laser down and turns to the slab and freezes
She spins around only to find Jason standing behind her
He grabs her by the throat
She can't scream
She kicks wildly as he studies her
: Delongpre, Boemen, Kay-Em 14 and Thorgan wait and watch girl in the -
Thorgan is getting impatient
He can't find something
Anybody seen the reticulator
Adrienne is thrown into a work light
The room goes dark
Try next door, there was one there yesterday
Thorgan exits
' The lights go
Thorgan looks around
Through the thick glass, where is killing Adrienne, is blackness
Wakey wakey love birds
Yllo's gonna be pissed if he catches you fooling around instead of working
Thorgan roots through a drawer, his back to the glass
Through the glass beside him we see Adrienne screaming
But
All rooms are air tight
Her head is smashed on the glass
Still screaming, her face recedes back into the darkness as Thorgan looks over his shoulder
Bye, lovebirds
Stoney, you dog
He exits
As he - - Adrienne's head
Her body goes limp
He pulls her head up and stares at her frozen head, eyes open, mouth locked in a scream
He thumps the head against a wall
Jason drops the body with a thud then turns to the - - He chooses a long silver cleaver
'
Jason walks into the corridor from  , steam still rising from his cold body
He heads away from   as soon as he's out of sight, appears
Delongpre wakes as Yllo enters
All right, lets do this
Thorgan begin the Defib program, Delongpre, ready the drainage units
Boerman get the others in here
Boeman grabs a wall mike
' Kkinsa straddles Stoney
(
) We've got a heartbeat
Her back arches in ecstasy
No shit, we've got a heart beat
(
) Stoney, you copy
She's awake
You coming
Hell yeah 'm coming
No
not yet
(
) Yes, right now
(
) Stoney, put your pants on and get your ass down here
They jump up grab their clothes and rush to the door
Stoney hits the door release and the door  open revealing - - Standing in the hall
He swings the silver cleaver
Stoney sidesteps as Kkinsa
Stoney  his palm into the door panel
The door  to close but Jason's hand reaches out and stops it
as   to force the door open
Stoney keeps  the panel, trying to make the door close but Jason's too strong
Jason grabs Stoney by the arm, jerks him into the doorway and releases the door
The door closes
Splitting Stoney from forehead to crotch
Splashed with blood, Kkinsa falls to the floor cowering
mumbling nonsensically
Yllo, Janessa, Thorgan, Boemen and Delongpre anxiously huddle around the Frozen Girl's body
Probes dangle in the gel
It's time
What about the others
Shouldn't we wait
've waited long enough
Kay
you know what to do
Kay presses buttons
We hear the whine of something powering up
Brodski enters the lab
What the hell are you doing
My job
Fine, just stay out of my way
(turns to Kay) Hit it
An electrical noise flares    : : Running, freshly killed bodies at our feet
Small fists beat against a door
' Mom
Dad
It's loose
He's loose
The door swishes open revealing the dead bodies of a couple in their forties
We recognize her as the frozen girl
Her name,  (18), pretty
She screams
Turns
Standing at the end of the corridor, back lit and ominous is He marches towards her
She runs
Snatches a headset from a wall mount
Help me
Anyone
Somebody help me
from the radio
Jason closing
She reaches down and grabs a shot gun from a dead Security Guard
Chick- chick
Jason keeps coming
She runs
As she rounds a corner, we  see - - She opens the door and enters the cold room
Slips on the wet frozen ground, nearly falls
as he rounds the corner, sees the open door
Jason enters, his machete held ready
He stares at the Huge Cryo unit
Door open
Otherwise the room is empty
(
) Hey
Jason turns
Rizzo is standing in the hall, the shotgun ready
You son of a bitch
Jason slides backwards on the slick floor
Further, he nearly falls
He stumbles, falls backwards into the cryo-unit
Rizzo slams her palm onto a console, the Cryo-unit door closes, tosses the gun to the floor and types on a keypad
Steam , engines hum to life
The Cryo-Unit, Bucks violently
Cryo-Unit activated
Slowly the unit goes silent, still
Rizzo stares at it, approaches slowly, staring at the fogging glass - -
The     , slicing into Rizzo's shoulder
The cryo lab's main door  shut
Cryo-Unit leak
Lock down in progress
Security measures on line
Nooooooo
She rushes toward the door
It won't budge
Somebody
No
Gas filters into the room from the leak in the Cryo-Unit
Subject in computer unit has reached full incubation
Rizzo begins to fade
She stumbles
No
Cryo gas rolls along the floor
As blood pours from her wound, she reaches her bloody hand to the glass window and draws - -then passes out
'  pop open
She gasps for breath
Coughing and splitting the Gel-like substance
She's sitting in a foot of gel, naked; Yllo, Brodski and the kids around her
That one did it
Yllo moves close to Rizzo
We should expect a moment of disorientation
Rizzo punches Yllo in the nose
Spunky
She broke my fucking nose
- 14 Again proving that your ancestors were savages
like her already
- 14 Live signs full strength
Heart rate above normal - Rizzo's disoriented, confused
Gel slops all around her
Where
Who
(shock) 'm alive
You brought me back
(rubbing his nose) Obviously so
Rizzo looks down at her body, gel dripping off her naked flesh
What the hell is this shit
Delongpre gives her a blanket
She covers herself
How did  get here, how did you bring me back
Nanotechnology
Nano
but nanotechnology is impossible
We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years
30
How long was  out
Rizzo finally takes a good look at where she is
Something is very wrong in her world
The year is 2455
You've been frozen for the past four hundred years
Rizzo gasps -- a shocking revelation
Now lay back we need to do some tests and  have some questions
The hockey player
He a friend of yours
Hockey player
He's not a
He's dead
Everyone's dead
Old Earth is dead
Old Earth
We need to do some tests
'd like to ask you a few questions
But
400 years
That's right, now if you could
Delongpre frowns at Yllo and moves to Rizzo
It can wait
Let's get you cleaned up
Delongpre helps Rizzo off the table
Wait a minute
need
Give it a rest Yllo
She needs some time
Come on
Rizzo stands at a small window looking out into space
Cleaned up she is quite beautiful
(
) Rizzo
Rizzo is startled
She looks around
Yeah
Delongpre comes through the door with a plate of food
thought that after 400 hundred years, you just might have a little bit of an appetite
He puts the food on a small table and moves to the window
You're on Grendel, a class  Catamaran transport
It's basically a school bus
We're on our way back to Earth
It's finals week
She turns back to the window
You're telling me 'm a friggen class project
Delongpre flinches, expecting to be hit
(a beat) Sort of
mean, no, not really
She collapses onto the bed
'll give you a moment alone
Do you want me to come get you when we start the dissection
Rizzo shrugs
She's lost everyone and everything
She's lot 400 years
Delongpre backs out of the room, closing the door behind him
Rizzo stares at the pile of her old clothes
She reaches into the pocket of her tattered jacket and removes a set of keys
The key chain holds a picture
a picture of her parents
She sits on the bed and starts to cry
As Delongpre enters all eyes turn to him
Well
She needs a little time
More time
shit, she's had 400 years
Yllo laughs at his own joke
That's really funny
'd want her statements before we reach porch
Jesus, women
Yeah, like you'd be a rock after everything she went through
(
) Dissection
Theyturn
Rizzo approaches Delongpre and Yllo
Jason
He's on this ship
Of course he is
He's the most relevant find in 400 years
except for you, of course
Look if you're worried about  don't be
You're walking and talking
He's a stiff
You'll get the publicity
(glares) Are you finished
Yllo nods then -- Rizzo punches him again
God damnit
Will you stop doing that
Oh  like her a lot
'm with you kid
Where is he
(points) Lab two, relax
What's the matter
He's dead
No, you're dead
You're all dead
She shoves Delongpre out of the way and out the door
- The others enter to find Rizzo leaning over Adrienne's headless body
Jesus
Oh my God
Adrienne
What have you done
What have  done
Idiots
Thorgan throws up
(into a mike) Brodski
Get to Lab two
We have an emergency
Er, guys
Where's the Hockey Player
'll tell you where he is
He's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves
Maybe she tripped
Brodski and Kicker burst into Lab Two, they react to the carnage
Jesus, God
Oh man, what the hell happened
Jason
Can't you see
He did this
Impossible
He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis
There is no possible way he could be alive
didn't say he was alive
: 52 Azrael moves through a maze of walls and pipes
Stea,  lights He's dressed in full military garb, a huge gun strapped to his hsoulder
Something watching Azrael, his back to us
Azrael moves
The stalker closes in
Suddenly Azrael hits, rolls and comes up Blasting right at us
, fangs, claws and so on, leaps at him
THe big blaster hits home
The alien
Sitting on the floor, Azrael sighs and wipes his brow
SUddenly, another alien rises up behind him with a hideos Screech
There's nothing Azrael can do
He's a goner
Then -- blast from elsewhere -- , the grunt Azreael had words with earlier
That's nine to four, geek-boy
You got lucky
You got lucky
could have waited until he ate your head
Speaking of which, duck
Dallas hits the deck as Azrael , disintegrating another
Beyond it lunge a half dozen more
Dallas and Azrael scramble to their feet, take aim, when -- squirts from its body
What the
another alien, splitting it down the middle
Then another
He's good
Azrael smiles knowingly
He takes aim and lets loose a blast at Jason
Aliens scatter as the blasts hits Jason dead on
Dallas joins in unloading on the hulinking terror
THeir assault has no effect on Jason whatsoever
That sucks
Why won't he go down
Pause play
Suddenly the aliens freeze in place
Jason stares at them, then turns to Dallas and Azrael
He's not part of the program
Hey cool
They brought ancient hockey guy back to life
Jason walks up to them
Titls his head like a dog hearing a high-pitched whistle
Why aren't they running
Hey
We're playing a game here
Get off the court
Jason raises his silver blade high
No, we're playing a game
not you numbnuts
The blade slices through Azrael's shoulder to the bottom of his rib cage
Blood spurts as his right side pulls away from his body
Azrael does not seem hurt, only pissed
Asshole that does not count as a kill
Yes it does
Oh, come on
is confused
He spins and slashed taking Dallas' head clean off
The head falls to the ground, then Dallas speaks
Okay, enough of this shit
Alright, asshole
The sound of an
Jason finds himself standing alone on a huge open court, all white, sterile
No creatures, no Dallas or Azrael
both ends of the white garganuan room we see a small tinted glass
Azrael's voice booms over a loud speaker
(
) Clear off the court, asshole
Azrael sits before a huge console wearing a virtual reality suit
Dallas is in his own suit from the opposite booth
don't have all day, kid
Yeah yeah  better call the labs, see what the hell is going on
Jason stares at the tinted glass of Azrael's booth
(into mike) Lab
this is  in the game grid
Your guy got out and runined our game
: The reaction to the broadcast
Azrael can you repeat that
Get him out of there
(into mike) said the guy in the mask is in here ruining our game
Jason starts to close in on Azrael's pod
(continuing) Send someone to the grid to pick him up
He looks lost
That's impossible
told you
Get them out of there
(grabs mike) Get out of there
Get out of there now
(into mike) All right fine, we'll head back-- Suddenly,  shoves his fist through the glass
Jesus
The sounds of Azrael's  broadcast over the lab
When Jason retrieves his hand, he holds a bloody mass of Azrael's insides
, Brodski takes charge
Dallas
That you
Come back
(into mike) Sarge
Get the fuck down here
We got a real shitstorm in the -- fights to get out of his virtual reality suit and get himself into combat mode
hears the movement
Turns, flings his silver blade
It flies across the room, throught the glass and impales Dallas' throat to his chair
The blade shrots out the electronics in the grid and plunges the room to black
As the connection goes to static
(into mike) Dallas
Dallas
Do you copy
Nothing
Finally
He's dead
They're both dead
You don't understand what is on this ship
This is a being that kills
That's what he does
That's all he does
And he is very good at it
Kicker, Sven
Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on
She gets up and heads for the door
Where are you going
We have to get off this ship
Yllo who has been losing control takes on the lead again
That's ridiculous
You're overreacting
Why don't you get it
He's going to kill us all
doubt that
think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us
Look
Just get everyone together, get off the ship
and then blow it to kingdom fucking come
That's the only way you're going to live
You just need to relax
Rizzo ti's the future
We have soldiers on board, - Grunts, the baddest of the bad
and their weapons
'm sure are slightly more advanced than what you're used to
hope so
Sven and Kicker approach the door
Casually, weapons slung low
The doors hiss open, the black maw of the game grid on the other side
Damn
Are they playing
Dallas
Azrael
Their combat sense perks up a bit
Something's not right
They turn on their lights and ready their weapons
:  Hard beams of light search for anything
Sven, as his beam hits Azrael's pod
Oh shit
From inside pod as Sven and Kicker approach
THe blood splattered inside the glass glows in the throws of their lights
Kicker breaks off to inspect the other  Sven tries to hold down his lunch
Sarge, this is bad
The kid's His guts are ripped out
(over radio) Dead
Oh yeah
Kicker reaches the other
the darkness looms behind him as he finds his friend
(into radio) Sarge, this is Kicker
Dallas got it to
Real slice and dice
What should we do
Everyone is in shock except Brodski
he's a pro
Report to weapons
We're going on a hunt
Roger that
(to himself) Time to kick some ass
From behind him a shape materializes
hand reaches out of the darkness
Spins around with his weapon at the ready
'
Sorry
Don't friggen do that
Brodski is in assault mode
Yllo, what's your head count
Looks like we're missing two
Stone and Kkinsa
You know, Stoney's done everyone on this trip but me
what's up with that
Brodski scans the room - a tactical assessment
This place should be safe
Get them back here
don't want to be hunting around and kill one of your kids by accident
As much as 've dreamed of doing that
Brodski goes to Rizzo while Yllo buzzes Stoney's cabin
need to know what you know about this guy
Don't go out there
You can't win
We need to get off this ship
That's all there is to it
Not an option
'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down
Rizzo shakes her head
She can't get through to this guy
've been a grunt for fifteen years
There's not a problem  can't fix with enough ammunition
Yllo is getting no response
Stoney
Stoney if you can hear me, get your ass down to the lab immediately
(beat) 'm going to see if  can find them
Yllo opens the door and Kkinsa is there
Half-naked, covered in blood
Janessa  and the others gasp
Kkinsa falls to the floor
whimpering, in shock
Boeman rushes over to her with a blanket
Sstoney's dead
They all look to each other, searching for what to say or do
Rizzo puts her head in her hands
not again
Brodski double-checks his sidearm as Yllo follows him down the hall
'm saying is dock with Space Lab, couple of hours no more
Let them take a look at our friends
Not a chance
JUst don't go in there half cocked
You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later
You got that right
They arrive at the door of the
This thing could be worth a great deal
scientifically
not to mention what the fat cats on Earth  would pay for it
Look, 'll split it with you 50/50
The door opens
The - Grunts are all there
Weapons in a rack on one wall
They are in various states of battle dresss
Yllo follows Brodski in
Brodski turns and faces him, his men behind
You sumbitch
Three dead
On my watch
If that
that thing is out there, it's dead
You got it
Fuckin
Now get out of our way
get back to the lab and baby sit your snot nosed brats
we've got a job to do
Yllo enters pissed off
The others are standing around not sure what to do
That bastard
Boemen turn on the tracking monitors
Rizzo walks over to Kay-em 14
Thorgon is working on her
Robot huh
- 14 Kay-em 14
Barbie from hell
- 14 Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six
Yeah 3cpo,  saw  , now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie
- 14 'm afraid  cannot assist
Rizzo is very frustrated
'm surrounded by idiots
- 14 You need to get laid
Thorgon looks up from his work
Sorry, 'm working on it
Are all twenty-first century girls like you
He'll kill us all
You know that, don't you
(re:monitor) There's been an unauthorized entrance to the Cargo Bay
Got it
Let's move out girls
Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs
(into the mic) At least try to get him alive
will ya Brodski
(v
o
) 'll try
: - kicker, sven, , , and  are locked and loaded
Dressed in full armor, packing massive high tech weaponry, they are a sight to see
Jason may have met his match
Alright, the teach requests we take this guy out at the knees
say shoot to kill
The boys fidget with excitment
Bout time they see some action
So after you've killed him, put one in his knee so we can say we tried
The men  and high five
Go to infrared, stay in radio contact
(into headset) Teach you there
Yllo walks in and sits at a bank of monitors
Through one, we see the team standing at the cargo doors
Yeah,  got ya
don't see anything inside though
(
) You just keep an eye out
Yeah yeah
Got it
Yllo removes his head set and quickly turns to a separate console
He has his own agenda
- Let's move out
The doors  open
massive room
Boxes stacked hihg, some to the ceilin,g creating a maze
Two teams, Port, starboard
They split up
The kids are standing at a schematic of the ship
Several small blips are entering the cargo area
(
) Kicker, anything
(
) Negative
Rizzo stands over Thorgan to see the monitor
Each blip represents a trained killer
It's men like that fought off the pirates on Earth , battled Jauntuns on the solar moons
For the moment, Rizzo looks distantly hopeful
So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff
They could hack him to pieces
Exactly
- Briggs and Geko move side by side
Condor brings up the rear
Suddenly he is jerked out of view
' , jason's hand around his throat
The eyes go dead, the neck broken
Rizzo sees something
Her hopes fade
' All eyes turn to the schematic as one of the blips  and
- 14 -x Grunt Condor has flatlined
(into mic) Sergeant, this is Boemen
- Sergeant Brodski stops
(v
o
) You've lost Condor
Briggs, Geko, talk to me
- Briggs and Geko stare at each other
He was
he was right here
to hell
We're coming to you
flashes for a second on the screen
You see that
Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage
- Got it
and  split up, moving around a large metallic tank
Gun ready, he moves around the crated fuselage slowly
don't see anything
The blip flashes again
- (
) He's right there
In front of you
reveal  moving toward him
That's
mAYBE you kids should stay out of this
Briggs removes his gogles only to find Jason standing before him, holding Geko's body
impaled onto his silver blade
fires
screams
(
) He doesn't show up on
then two more blips disappear
(turns) Jesus, is this what it was like on your
Rizzo is cowering on the floor, her hands over her ears
She's sweating, convulsing
Sergeant, you've lost two more men
BAy - Brodski and his remaining men double-time-it to the slaughter
Briggs and Geko lie dEAD Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing
Teach
Where the hell are you
Where's our visuals
Yllo is talking on  aseparate mike
Unwaakre of the slaughteri n the next room
Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab
(
) 'll need the sergeant's okay on that
We've got a situation here
Just do as  you're told
(
) Alright, relax
20 minutes
Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction
Thank you
Yllo disconnects, and turns to the other console
(into mic) Ok Sarge, what's your status
(
) wHAT' My status
've lost three men and your worthless fuck
After kill this asshole 'm coming your Yllo
But  didn't see
- (
) got him
got him
from everyone except Rizzo who knows better
She shakes her head
Yes
Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing
Duck fuckers
He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead
Okay, you know , that's it for me
'm outta here
Outta here
Isn't there an escape  on this ship
Something
There's a shuttle
Alright, been nice knowing you
Who's with me
'll go
Yllo said stay here
Fuck Yllo
They got him
You're not leaving
- Sven is kneeling over Jason's body
Big sucker too
Suddenly, Jason reaches up, grabs the back of Sven's head and  it into his mask
Sven's forehead shatters
As he races around a crate
Sven's body is within sight
His killer nowhere to be seen
Kicker
Where are you
Elsewhere we hear  followed closely by a
Kicker crawls across the floor, blood spews from his mouth
He's been split in half at the wait
his entrails dragging behind him
machete throught the back of the neck puts him out of his misery
Do something
Don't look at me
'm in high school
Brodski runs
He's spooked
Twisting and turning in every direction
Find Crutch
Set up an ion field around the cargo bay
We'll torch the sucker
Yllo
you're a dead man
Brodski races toward the Cargo exit
We see Brodski racing towards us
We also see Jason, lying in wait, hidden by one of the crates
Sergeant
(stops) What
Yllo considers then
Nothing
On the monitor we see Brodski move forward
He never saw Jason coming
Yllo turns his head
The kids stand in shock, silently staring at one another, listening to the static of the dead communications
Boeman reaches over and clicks off the radio
Silence
Rizzo leaps to her feet
Lesson number one, kiddies
You wanna get home safely then we get off this boat
Kkinsa starts t cry
don't understand
what does he want
He wants to kill you
and me
and everyone on this ship
Rizzo looks at everyone
Any questions
side door
Yllo enters
You're not going anywhere
You wanna die
(ignores her) Are we locked down
That door's the only way in or out and it won't open without the code
Then we wait
We're docking with Space Lab in less than an hour
What good will that do
They can deal with this sort of thing
More soldiers
Scientists
Very intellegent men
That's great
bet they'll kick Jason's ass at a spelling bee
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this
Try to calm down
Just think, you're going to be famous
(to kids) Guys, please come with me
4You're not going anywhere
Rizzo starts for the door but Yllo grabs her arms, holds them behind her
Now hold on
We should hear her out
She's obviously dealt with this guy before
Shut up
She just wants this thing dead
No shit
got no problem with that
Janessa readies a hypo
Maybe if we knew a little bit more about what we're delaing with here
Janessa moves behind Rizzo with the sedative
Suddenly Rizzo throws her head back, Salmming it into Yllo's nose
He   in pain
Janessa lunges with the syringe but Rizzo snatches her wrist, grabbing the hypo, burying it into Janessa's left breast
tNighty-night
Janessa collapses
Yllo rushes Rizzo again, but this time Boeman stands, blocks his path
Leave her be
Ok, who do  gotta fuck to get off this boat
Thorgan timidly raises his hand
Listen to me
Please
Let's get off thsi ship
Come with me
Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space
We'll die oout there
Rizzo rushes the door
There's a code box on the wall
How do you open the damn door
You're crazy
Kkinsa punches in the code
The door  open
Rizzo, he's out there
Yeah and he'll be here soon enough
(looks at Delongpre) Last chance
The others stare at her
She's crazy
Fine
Bye
She and Kkinsa exit, the door   behind them
(favoring his nose) Pack your shit
We'll disembark in an hour
The guys at Space Lab have the necessary equipment to contain this thing and then we can study it
But the kids aren't so sure
Yllo enters, makes sure he wasn't followed then approaches a console
Computer on line
series of beeps
(
) What are you doing
(jumps) Jesus
Can't you knock
(back to console) Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf
Power to Beowulf disengaged
(to Janessa) She's too valuable
She's not leaving this ship
: Fat Lou and Bernie prepare for course corrections
Disengage auto-pilot
Disengaged
New , seven-eighty-one
She banks slowly to the right
On course
36 minutes, 34 seconds
Engage auto pilot
Suddenly, Bernie is ripped from his chair
Electricity  through the console as Bernie's  becomes jibberish
En-en-en-en
Eta-Eta
Fat Lou stares up in shock just before   Bernie's torso ontop of her
' upper body has disappeared
In other words, Bernie now has legs
Little good they'll do him
Far in the distance we see a tiny space station --
monitor reads
00:35:59 and counting
: Rizzon and Kkinsa enter
Which way
Kkinsa points
They head in that direction
Then Rizzo suddenly stops
What
Ssh
Rizzo pulls Kkinsa close to one of the crates
He's in here
Kkinsa opens her mouth to scream
Rizzo slaps her hand over Kkinsa's mouth
You scream 'll snap your neck
Got it
Kkinsa nods
Rizzo releases her
(whispers) How do you know
(dread) just know
The crew has packed their essentials and now wait to dock with Space Lab
Yll is standing before the others holding Jason's machete
We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey
'm thinking Rizzo was right
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre
Maybe we should go with them
Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing
At least we'll be safe
They are not going anywhere
cut power to the  shuttle
The kids and Crutch stare at him
Cold hearted
Rizzo and Kkinsa approach
Open the doors
Kkinsa punches in a series of buttons
Nothing
Something's wrong
Keep trying
Everyone ready
Yllo grabs a mike from a console
Fat Lou, what's the
Lou, goddamjnit
Bernie, where's Lou
Boeman moves to one of the consoles, clicks a few buttons
We see the view from the bridge security camera
Lots of blood and the mangled combination of Lou and Bernie
Yuck
We're screwed
The ship doesn't need pilots to dock
We'll disembark and you'll see
Everything will be fine
Uh
that's gonna be a problem
The ship's not on auto-pilot
We're flying blind
(a beat) Thirty minutes till impact
All eyes turn to Yllo, for guidance, his back to the outer door
guess
we'll have to go to the bridge
But
Jason is out there
Then -- --
The outer door bucks and dents
Everyone jumps
--
- : Over the headsets, Rizzo and Kkinsa hear the
Damnit, he's got them
Kkinsa keeps trying the code box
Nothing
Rizzo,  think Yllo must have done something
The door won't open
It's alright
He can't get in here
But the door is starting to give
Through the confusion, Crutch moves to one of the consoles
Clicks away at the keyboard
The shuttle hums to life
The power's back up
Then open the doors
Thirty seconds
What do we do
Crutch
Help me up
Boeman helps Crutch to the top of a table
Crutch goes to work on a ceiling vent, removing screws
Okay, 'm guessing you should hurry
The top corner of the door bends
Jason peers through
Jesus, tell this asshole  don't play hockey
Okay
Our group starts climbing the table and into the ceiling space
Will that take us to the bridge
It's a maze up there, but yes
We'll engage auto-pilot
Everything'll be fine
With that, the door gives
Boeman heaves Crutch into the crawl space then follows himself
Jason pauses, staring at Kay-Em -- - 14 Heart beat irregular
no blood flow
impossible
this
this
does not make sense
Jason's heard enough
He swings his cleaver, but Kay-Em ducks
Turns and leaps through the hole in the celing
Yllo grips the ledge
Move it people
Then Yllo screams
Jason has him from below
Boeman grabs his arms
Help me
DeLongpre grabs hold and pulls
Suddenly Yllo is jerked out of their grasp
They fall onto their backs breathing heavily
Yllo leaps to his feet
Jason looms over him
Now hold on
Have you considered how valuable you are
Credit, fame, you can have it all
And ladies mean, how long has it been
Jason stands there, but his attention isn't on Yllo
It's on the machete sticking through Yllo's belt
Jason reaches for it
Yllo backs into a wall
Jason slowly removes the machete from Yllo's belt and stares at it
He drops the cleaver to the ground
(chuckles) That's all you wanted
The shuttle doors slide open as we hear over the headset -- (
) It's okay, he just wanted his machete
(knowingly) Three
two
one
Yllo screams
Yllo's  turn to
All eyes stare at the opening in the walkway, then -- '    '
- 14 Now that's just gross
,
, ,
They race down the walkway, over huge pipes and through electrical wires, Crutch in the lead
Kkinsa enters the shuttle, turns to Rizzo
Rizzo, come on
But, Rizzo hesitates
We can still hear the   over the headset
(
) Go-go-go-go-go
(
) He's right behind us
Damn
(to Kkinsa) Close the door
'll be right back
(panicked) What
gotta go back
But
Rizzo turns and races through the maze of boxes and crates leaving Kkinsa nearly insane
- 14 'm quite sure  wasn't designed for this
Crutch comes to a fork in the walkway
Okay, we need to
You forgot didn't you, you old fart
At the back of the line, Delongpre turns as Jason rounds the bend behind him
Shit
Move it
He's coming
Delongpre leaps forward creating a pile out of Janessa and Thorgan Go
Racing forward the group stays just out of Jason's grasp
Leaping over and under and through whatever blocks the path
Faster
Jason swings his machete at DeLongpre
It just misses him
Crutch comes to ascreened panel
Boeman kicks it open
They leap down onto a catwalk crossing the -- They are twenty feet off the ground as -- Rizzo stops, stares straight up
the group races across the catwalk as Json leaps down behind them
He's right on my ass
Then Jason grabs Delongpre, who screams
, spots a gun left by one of the marines
She snatches it, points it towards Jason and Delongpre then aims a little high
It slices through a metal cord holding the catwalk to the ceiling
The catwalk jerks
Everyone tumbles
Jason loses his grip on Delongpre
Suddenly,  , as the catwalk gives under the weight
It in half,dumping both heroes and Jason
dives out of the way as a pile of metal and bodies crash to the ground
Janessa sits up rubbing her head
That was fun
Kay-Em 14 sits up, sings
- 14 got a brand new pair of roller-skates, you got a brand new key
Thorgan
didn't do it
The fall scattered her programming
wait
Where's
Shit
He's lying on top of Jason
He scrambles to his feet
But Jason doesn't move
Hey,  think the fall killed him
The group slowly gathers around
Jason sits up and swings at Thorgan
Boeman pulls him out of the way just in time
Jason starts to stand when  comes up behind him
-
She brings the barrel of a high tech gun down on the top of Jason's head
He collapses
The surrounded faces look happily suprised
Trust me, it's temporary
Boeman takes the gun from Rizzo
Better let me
Where'd you get the gun
Rizzo gestures at what's left of Geko's body
The bridge is this way
They take off running
Wait
Everyone stops, turns -- - 14 There's not enough time
Rizzo catches up
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting
(to Kay-Em) What do you mean, not enough time
- 14 (switches voice) You know what you get if you shove two bananas up your ass
Two shit covered bananas
think your metal lover's losing it
- 14 (normal voice) Impact in ten minutes
It will take fifteen to reach the bridge
(switches voices, sings) Mamma's little baby love shortnin, shortnin, mamma's little baby love shotnin bread
Well, 'm not hanging out here with Ms
Showtunes
Guys
The shuttle
The kids look at one another as if this were a stroke of genius
Idiots
This way
Crutch again leads them through the maze
Delongpre stops at another Grunt body, removes a chain gun
THorgan takes a high tech laser from another
feel better
Now how do you fire this damn thing
Just go
've a feeling he's right behind us
(jokingly) Just around this bend
Jason steps out in front of Crutch, his machete held poised in front of him
Crutch runs right up onto the blade
Nooooo
Alrhoguh he's meat on a stick, Crutch doesn't give up
He  his fists into Jason's torso
Thorgan turns to fire --Boeman  the barrel high
You'll hit crutch
Boeman tosses his weapon to Janessa and leaps on Jason's back, locking his arms around his neck
What are you doing
You can't save him
Delongpre smashes the back of Jason's knee with the chaingun
Jason topples on top of Boeman
Crutch is thrown free
Janessa and Thorgan help Crutch to his feet as Jason sees Rizzo for the first time in 400 hundred years
It's either love at first sight or one hell of a grudge
He leaps to his feet and races towards her
Don't just stand there
Shoot him
(to Jason) No you don't
The chaingun dances Jason backwards
He  through the side of one of the cargo boxes
Don't stop
She jerks the gun from Delongpre and races to the crate
You never stop when he's down
But the crate is empty
Shit
They spin around, searching
(weak) Forget him
Come on
Carrying Crutch, they move toward the shuttle bay
panel, clicks some buttons, then -- Uh-oh
What
Kkinsa
Open the doors
Kkinsa sits in the pilot's seat
She's terrified
(
) Kkinsa
He's coming
Open the doors
DeLongpre shoves Boeman out of the way
Kkinsa, open the goddamn door
Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work
(
) (calming) Kkinsa, it's me, Rizzo
He's not out here right now, so please let us in
Kkinsa doesn't move
(
) Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt
We need access to the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die
Med-kit
guessed
Kkinsa considers
She reaches for a button marked hesitates
(
) We're going to be okay, Kkinsa
Just relax
Kay-Em 14 steps forward
- 14 Allow me
'm trained in all aspects of the human psyche
Rizzo backs away -- as Kay-Em nears the mike
- 14 Kkinsa, dear, it is , - 14
open the fucking door you silly bitch
Rizzo shoves Kay-Em out of the way
- 14 didn't say  was good at it
(
) Oh shit
There he is
Jason is standing at the entrance to the Cargo Shuttle Bay
Kkinsa leans forward and presses -- The Shuttle  to life and begins pulling away from the ship
Kkinsa
No
The shuttle moves slowly away from the docking position
Rizzo opens fire
Thorgan and Delongpre join in
As boxes and cargo shatter under the heaby fire
Smoke rises
It's impossible to see where Jason is
stops
'
But, they don't let up
Boxes explode, crates collapse until -- Thorgan's gun clicks empty
Then Delongpre's
The smoke slowly clears revealing the rubble
Did we get him
Suddenly, Jason again steps into the Cargo entrance
We're screwed
400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do
They are trapped
Jason blocks the only exit
He slowly moves towards them
Just make a break for the door
He'll get some of us, but that's the breaks
We're not leaving Crutch
We don't have time to argue
But Jason has locked in on Rizzo
He moves towards her
Okay, tell you what
You die, we'll run
Rizzo and the others back into a corner
Jason has them
There's nothing they can do
Rizzo holds the gun steady, waiting for point blank range
, which was only a dot the last time we saw it, suddenly looms toward us
Collision eminent
The left side of Grendel  into the side of Space Lab
Suddenly everything shifts toward the bridge
Boxes, cargo, kids, and Jason
Grendel  along  , ripping huge chunks of metal from both
fly
There are interior  on Space Lab, then -- -
Space Lab
The entire ship shifts upwards
Cargo, crew, and Jason fly into the air
fires sprout up all over
Cargo boxes , contents loses her gun
Debris from Space Lab  into the side of the ship and beyond
One huge chunk heads right towards the Shuttle
Kkinsa stares out the window as the huge chunk flies toward her
Everything piled and in tatters
Our heroes slowly regain their bearings
Everyone okay
think  broke my arm
- 14 seem to have misplaced mine
Kay-Em 14's right arm is missing, wires sticking out of the stump
You geeks wanna gimmie a hand
Janessa is buried beneath a pile of rubble
Boeman helps her to her feet
(quiet) We lost crutch
Rizzo stands and watches as the other sgather around Crutch's body
It's battered and twisted all out of place
Boeman falls next to the body
Goodbye old friend
Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out
(snaps) Could you show a little compassion
Rizzo stares at Boeman
Look, 'm sorry
really am, but aren't you forgetting about
a pile of rubble
Jason rises, his back to them
Back to the labs
But Jason has other plans
Seemingly unfazed by the past events he rushes after them
Dam-damage port side 59 percent
Decompression 40 percent
Gravity-y rotors failing
Our kids race toward the door, Jason right behind them -- Thorgan slams the door panel with his good arm
fly
The door won't open
Oh shit
They turn as Jason looms toward them, then -- Cargo and debris
Our heroes
Jason
The loss of gravity and Jason's steamrollering momentum  him into the cargo doors,  them open and sending him tumbling backwards
This is just great
- 14 Engage magnetics
Kay-Em 14's left hand magnetically locks to the Cargo frame a Jason grabs Rizzo's ankle
Boeman, floating close, punches Jason in the back of the head
Still holding Rizzo's ankle, Jason topples, spinning the two out of frame
The force of the punch sends Boeman in the opposite direction
This is crazy, we can't do anything like this
Rizzo  Jason in the top of the head, sending him  into the ceiling
floats past DeLongpre
There's a chain gun still clutched by the  hand
Delongpre grabs both and turns the gun on Jason
Jason is sent further back, but the force of the chaingun Delongpre into a back wall
He's knocked unconcious
As Thorgan manages to grab Kay-Em 14 around the neck
Grab my hand
Janessa takes his hand and in turn reaches out and snags the unconcious dELONGPRE'
Boeman, can you reach DeLongpre
We'll push you in
- Jason is floating toward the other end of the Cargo Bay, unable to stop himself
reaches for DeLongpre
Inches away
Finally he grabs Delongpre by the locks of his hair, pulls himself closer
Hey
That hurts
Rizzo is floatin g up near the ceiling
She manages to grab hold of a hanging piece of busted catwalk
(to Rizzo) Push off toward us
Forget her, she's a pain in the ass
Let her hang there
Crutch's body floats into our heroes, his intestines spilling from his open gut, tangling around our heroes
'm gonna spew
That ought'a help the situation
Do it Rizzo
We'll catch you
' Rizzo stares at the human rope that consists of Thorgan, Janessa, Boeman, and Delongpre
What if you miss
What if we don't
steadies himself against a wall, focuses in one Rizzo, then pushes off with his feet
toward her
He's coming right at you
Rizzo spots Jason and pushes off
But her aim was
and bad
She's gonna miss them
Boeman flips in the air
(to Delongpre) Grab my feet
Delongpre does and Boeman reaches out and snags Rizzo
The momentum spins the human chain into a near wall ---- nearly breaking it apart
Okay that hurt
Thorgan, pull us in
Jason  into the ceiling, then careens off of the wall -- As Thorgan pulls the group out of the Cargo bay
What now
They watch as Jason grabs a hold of the walkway
Shit
He's gonna send himself right at us
Jason takes aim
: System repair activated
Back up power on line
Jason again     -- when He drops to the cargo floor like a rock
Falling cargo -- huge crates, gargantuan machines, a forklift -- buries him
Our heroes tumble to the ground
(to Rizzo) Get off of me
They stand slowly, eyeing the rubble
(rubbing his arm) You think it killed
(off Rizzo's stare) Yeah,  guess not
Let's just get out of here
The ship's in bad shape
Back to the labs
Let's check out status
Our group makes their way back toward the labs
fires are everywhere
Systems are shorting out all over the ship
Rizzo, in the lead, enters the lab, when the ship  and portion of the hall collapses behind her
Boeman and the others dive back out of the way
Shit
The hull's imploding
Rizzo
Can you hear me
Yeah
Are you guys okay
Boeman peers through a crack in the collapsed hull
There's a red lever on the wall beside you
Pull it
Rizzo turns, spots the red lever
It's bolted
It's locked
Then break it
If you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize
Rizzo kicsk the metal leg from a table
the bolt with it, until it breaks
Hurry Rizzo
You have to reverse the pressurization
She grabs the lever
then hesitates
Backs away
What are you doing
If the ship goes, so does Jaso
Rizzo pull the fucking lever
No
Rizzo
It's better this way
If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship
You want him on your precious Earth
Boeman and the other start tearing the debris out of the way
Hurry
She's lost it
So what else is new
Boeman climbs through a hole in the rubble
He grabs the lever
Boeman don't
You know 'm right
Are you crazy
Pull the lever
Boeman yanks the lever
As the others climb into the lab -- Depressurization inconclusive
- 14 We've lost too much pressure
An hour, tops
(to Rizzo) You happy
You've killed us all
Thorgan rushes over to the big Nano-tech machine
Places his broken arm on the slab
The machine quickly goes to work
schematic of his arm appears on the wall
Janessa stares at him
What's the point
Delongpre shrugs
So that's it then
It seems it is
Janessa stands over Yllo's decapitated body
It's obvious their relationship went beyond just teacher/student
There is a loud   from the ship's hull
What's that
THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship
- 14 No
(signing) That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang
Are there any other shuttles
No
Teleportation
Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge
You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you
little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it
- 14 'll never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod
Damn
Am  in there
- 14 Sory
Hey
That's a good fantasy, though
Kinky, but good
Hey
All heads turn to Rizzo
She's staring at a schematic of the ship
The left hull of the two hulled ship is lit up with blinking light denoting the various system failures
Rizzo points to the right hull
What's this
It's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom
Rizzo points at the thin walk-ways connecting the two hulls
Can we get through these
Sure but what good will that do
When the left hull goes, so will the right
What if we blow the walkways first
Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship
They stare at her
You know, Yllo seemed to think we could catch this guy alive, well, he'd be worth millions
The others stare at her as if she were crazy
Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental
'm just saying
(to others) Come on
You got all these gadgets and shit
Why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up the doors and blow the walkways
We'd need charges
We could convert fission transistors
We're not supposed to do that
What are you gonna do, tell me
The engine room will have molecular welders
We could seal up the hull
moment of consideration
Could this actually work
YeaH,
And 'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job
Would you
- 14 Now this is getting exciting
Remember to roll his balls around a bit
You got a better plan
Obviously they don't
They got to work
Boeman grabs a number of devices from under a cabinet
'll need system four converters
They're back here
How many
Bring 'em all
Let's move
Thorgan's still hooked up to the Nano-Tech machine
Hey
'm not ready
Then you better hurry
'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there
Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there
You're so bossy
You're leaving me here alone
Delongpre tosses the chaingun next to him
Don't blow your foot off
They climb through the hole in the corridor and disappear
- 14 It's just you and me, then
Come here, might as well fix that arm
Boeman, Janessa, Delongpre, and Rizzo slowly move through the piles of debris
Still burning cargo creates a ghastly image of flickering shadows
See anything
They move toward the rubble that had buried Jason before
on the rubble
There is an obvious hole dug out from the middle
think  speak on behalf of the group when  say this is bad news
(into headset) Thorgan
You coming
Thorgan is fooling around in the back of Kay-Em 14's head
The nano-tech maching is doing a full diagnostics
(into headset) Almost done
- 14 Ow
Oh, hush
disengaged your pain programming
- 14 Sometimes  just wish  had a kitten
Boeman enters, throws his pack to the ground and goes to work ttaching a device to the wall of the huge glass connector
Janessa enters and goes through the same motions
Delongpre and Rizzo attach a device to the wall
Put your finger here
SHe does so
Delongpre connects several wires
Rizzo looks nervous
Delongpre notices
My father wanted me to be a businessman
Silence
That's why 'm here
So, you thought you'd be cool
Go against your father's wishes
Yeah, that's grown up
Delongpre looks at her like she's crazy
My father's company imports and exports
Archaeology is part of the business
We happen to get along just fine, smartass
Look, why don't you bust somebody else's balls for a change
thought you meant
You thought  meant
too tough to apologize, huh
You must have been a very lonely girl
Silence
Neither speaks
Thorgan rips a metallic sink from the wall
It  to the floor
Sorry, sorry
- 14(
) Who are you apologizing to
Good point
Boeman attaches another charge
He's sweating
Nervous
Keeps looking over his shoulder
Standing alone on this long walkway is a creepy sight
Janessa stops working, listens
- -- There's anoise in the Cargo Bay
She covers the mike on her headset and calls out
Thorgan, you little shit, is that you
No answer
She quickly turns to her pack and pulls out the bottle of tranquillizer and a monster syring
e She fills this rhino syringe with a massive dosage
Enough to bring down a Rhino
or Jason maybe
She starts moving down the walkway toward the Cargo Bay
Surely she's not that stupid
Rizzo is staring at Delongpre as he works on another device
Then -- When  was four, the ocean quit producing life
Too many pollutants
Nuclear testing, the occasional terrorist bombing
the atmosphere was shit by the time  was eight
We moved underground when  was twelve
Delongpre stares at her
He doesn't want to speak and screw up this rare moment of sharing
Janessa enters
Looks around
The cargo bay is dark and looming
Lights flicker
Emergency lights strobe
It's hard to make anything out
We hear Rizzo speaking Off Screen
(
) My father was an army Scientist
Genetics
The army thought they could develop humans able to survive the Earth we had created Janessa moves through the debris
We see Janessa come into view
(
) Jason seemed to have the right stuff
Physically, anyway
Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter
He just kept going
Were you close to your father
Thorgan interrupts over the headset
(
) Delongpre
What did you do with the chain gun
Delongpre frowns
(into mike) It's on the table where  left it
What the hell are you doing
Hurry up
(
) 'm on my way
(
) Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on
(
) 'm coming, 'm coming
Sorry, you were saying
' approaches the pile of debris where Jason was buried
(
) got along great with my father, my mother too
Dad and the others thought they could learn a great deal from this thing the army had been keeping on ice for over a hundred years
Janessa moves the debris around with her foot
(
) They were all wrong
They couldn't control him
And what happend to
Rizzo begins to tear up
couldn't save them
Well, we'd be dead without you
You know that, don't you
She stares at him
It's true
(chuckles) You caused enough stink that we were at least a little cautious
Of course this is the first field trip  went on that had a body count
She gives him a  half smile
'm not much, but  promise,  won't let this guy get you
Another half smile
It's a sweet gesture, but what can this guy really do
' He watches Janessa from a  distance
Moving slowly and silently toward her
She stands and turns as -- grabs her
She
He's covered in blood from a gaping wound in his gut
Where is everybody
What happened
Damnit
You scared the hell out of me
Give me a break
What happened
Jason
He's what happened
Then Grendel hit Space Lab
Space Lab
Wait'll  get my hands on Yllo
Yllo's dead
We
we thought you were too
Takes more than a steelbalde to take this old dog down
-
"   though Brodski's gut
Jason spins Brodski around and tosses him to the floor
Yup, that ought'a do it
Jason turns on Janessa
She stands frozen in fear
Jason raises his machete and -- Lights a flare, blinding Jason for the moment
Then she sinks the Rhino syringe into his chest
Jason stumbles
falls hard on his ass and sits there staring at her
Well go on
Pass out
Jason tears the syringe away and tosses it aside
Shit
Jason starts to climb to his feet
Janessa turns to run
(weak) He-help me
He holds his hand out to her
Then-- (
) 'm blowing Walkway One
Hold on
-
The
Janessa runs, leaving the sergeant behind
- Delongpre closes the door, then -- We're blowing three
Hang on
He throws a switch
- Boeman vaults over a pile of rubble
Janessa, we're on our way to you
Holding hands, Delongpre and Rizzo enter
They stop
stand
stare
The walkway is empty
Janessa is gone
Boeman rushes up behind them
Where is
You tell me
She's only set one charge
And it's not finished
With that Janessa tears into the walkway
She's out of breath
She can barely speak
Where have you been
He
He
He's coming
moves through the debris
He's coming straight for them
Run
They race down the length of the walkway
Jason right behind them
We can't lead him into the other hull
We don't have a choice
Boeman slams the door panel
The door slowly rises
Jason approaches, stops, stares at his future victims
If he could smile with anticipation
he would
He raises his Machete -- Then stops
Lowers it
-
-
-
He turns his back on our heroes
They crane their necks to see what has pulled his attention
marches down the walkway with - 14
The new and imporved - 14
Where her severed arm had once been, a chain gun is now attached laser cannon is mounted over her shoulder
Her body has been reinforced with steel from around the lab
Sinks, trays, you name it
She's the junk yard man's terminator
Then -- - 14 Do  have to
Yes, 've reprogrammed you
You are very brave
Bad ass
- 14 Oh, alright
- 14 We see a somewhat computerized image of Jason through Kay-Em's personal scan
One the display we see: : : 100 - 14 Come on, boy
Let's see if we can open up  can'a whoop ass
The chain gun rings
Jason is  into the
Holy shit
jumps up and rushes at Kay-Em who catches him and tosses him down the walkway -- Kay-Em opens up again
Kay-Em's weaponry shoves Jason out into the cargo bay witha  blur of bullets
What are we waiting for
Come on
Our heroes rush down the walkway toward the cargo bay
Boeman and Delongpre go to work setting the charges
(to Janessa) Where the hell were you
He came for me,  had to run
(into mike) Kay-Em, you okay
- 14 Don't worry about me
live for this shit
And with that, Kay-Em  the now standing Jason into another wall with the laser cannon
Toss me a chip
Delongpre pulls a trinket from his pack and pitches it to Boeman
Thorgan, you're brilliant
Have  told you that lately
Thorgan is standing at the end of the walkway staring into the cargo bay
He looks sad
(quietly) See you around
Kay-Em 14 marches toward the downed Jason, and starts singing an old Sea Shanty
- 14 She's the Yellow Rose of Taegu, the girl that  adore
Her cunt it smells like cock juice; she's a good two-dollar whore
You may talk to me of Seoul girls or whores from Tokyo, but the yellow rose of Taegu beats them all, 'd you know
Kay-Em blows Jason into -- She kicks him down the long corridor
The hull  from the exterior pressure
The ship
'd say we have about ten minutes tops
Then stop talking and work faster
Jason  through the debris that had been blocking the Lab
Kay-Em enters behind him
- 14 (still singing) She was a young and charming girl; her age was scarce sixteen
rushes - 14
- 14 She took me in and she kicked out a sailor and marine
-
His machete bounces off of Kay-Em's new armor
- 14 She had no titties on her chest; that didn't bother me, Kay-Em 14 back hands Jason across the room
He crashes into the glass speciments
Goo and formaldehyde covering him
- 14 For what she had between her legs was big enough for three
Boeman and Delongpre are finishing up
Okay, Janessa, give me your last charge
Janessa looks around, then -- don't know what  did
You lost the charge
He was chasing me
Can we blow it with just two
If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her
Then what do we do
don't know
Kay-Em stands over Jason
And for the first time in ten films Jason is in bad shape
But still climbs to his feet
slowly
- 14 Why you low life, scum sucking, rat dick blowing, sum bitch
Your mamma must'a had some huge balls
Of course, as anyone knows, you don't diss Jason's mother
Jason leaps, tacking Kay-Em 14
They roll into another glass case
Glass, formaldehyde and specimens rain down on top of them
Having lost his machete, Jason  at Kay-Em with his fists
and He catches a rhythm
Kay-Em is trapped below
Well, it was a good plan
They look at one another -- hopless
Then -- (
) You stupid bitch
Everyone jumps as Sergeant Brodski leans against the walkway door frame
He's bound his wounds with a make-shift tourniquet wrapped around his mid-section
Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die
Sergeant
We thought you were
Yeah, yeah
(to Janessa) Well, what have you got to say for yourself
don't know
sorry
Sergeant, we could use a big bomb
Bomb
Explosive
We're blowing the walkway
The sergeant tosses his pack to the ground
How much you need
of firststaking on this droid from the future
Finally, Jason stops
Straddling KAy-Em 14 he stares at his kill
until -- - 14 (condescending) That was very good
You should feel very good about yourself right now
Good effort
(tough voice) How could you hit a girl you sumbitch
Kay-Em 14 places the chaingun over Jason's chest
Jason is blown across the room
- 14 Okay, dip shit
Time to finish you off so  can go home and boink your momma with a corndog
The kinky bitch
Chaingun and laser cannon     on the fleshly body of The top portion of Jason's mask shatters
hIS         , then blown clean off for good measure
Jason falls on his ass
He raises his machete arm
last ditch effort
Could he be that lucky
To throw a machete and stop this onslaught
-
- 14 (singing) Bang, bang Maxewells silver hammer came down upon his head
Doo-pee- do-do
Bang, bang Maxewell's silver hammer made sure that he was dead
Jason climbs to his one good leg but i t only serves as a better aim for Kay-Em 14
-
The laser cannon blows Jason's left arm to hell
-
-
Two more blasts send Jason flying through the back wall and sliding across the floor
- 14' This time, Jason's body doesn't move
: : : - 14 Oh
my
god
What have  done
(crying) Thorgan
Kay-Em turns and races down the hall
- 14 Thorgan 'm a murderer
Boeman and Delongpre hustle to set the final charge
Blowing the walkway
You come up with that yourself
Rizzo did
-
-
Kay-Em steps into the walkway
She's covered in blood
Kay-Em
What are you doing back
- 14 (sad) Sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble
You killed him
- 14 (regret) Blew half his skull away, one leg, one arm and left his entrails stretched across the lab
And look at me
'm covered in his filthy blood
You did good, Kay-Em
'm proud of you
- 14 real mamma's boy that one
Dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum
Little good it did him
His mother
What
don't know
Nothing
Suddenly the ship's hull
The ship
Everyone tumbles
Hurry up people
We're running out of time
Jason's body is propped up against a machine in the same position we saw it before
This mass of torn flesh doesn't move
The ship  again
The machine  to life
and
Suddenly a laser scans Jason's body
Jason is leaned up against the Nano-Tech machine
Thorgan runs wire to each device
As long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance
Two more charges to go
- - We see a schematic of Jason's battered body on the monitor
Nano- technology is already at work
Hoses and wires now encircle Jason's body
We follow one of the hoses until it ends over -- nside we see pile of bullets
Stuff falls from the hose
Bullets from the chaingun, bullets from  every previous Jason movie
broken machete blade drops to the pile
The tip of an arrow
couple of knives
pair of pliers
An ink pen
The skeleton of a fish
The scanning lasers move to the stump at Jason's shoulder
We see the image as a new arm, fuzzy adn distorted, is being constructed
On the schematic, we see Jason's internal organs being repaired
By now  we've figured out
nothing good can come of this
Kay-Em 14 hits a button
The door begins to slide down slowly
Done
Let's move out
Kid, you ever thought about the marine corp
Delongpre calls fromthe far end of the walkway, welder in his hand
need another minute
Come on
Suddenly there is a
Engines  from behind them
The group stops and turns
The cargo door is starting to smoke
It  as it slowly opens
Well fuck me
- 14 No, fuck me
The door opens and Jason steps into the walkway
But he's no Jason we've ever seen before
His leg and arm are now His clothes are , no longer tattered
His mask is We can't see them, but we know
his insides are in better shape than ever
Kay-Em
Re-engage killer instinct
- 14 Yeeee-haw
Kay-em firs
But, this time it doesn't seem to faze Jason
fly as bullets vounce off of his metal limbs
Jason swings his new improved machete
It  off of Kay-Em's armor, removing a hunk of metal
Jason grabs her and swings her into the glass walkway
Glass
One of the wires, connecting two charges severs
Shit
Kay-em does a back flip, kicking Jason in the chest
He's shoved backwards
Boeman attempts to splice the wires back together as the battle ensues
'
Intellectual synthetic droid verses psychotic metallic killer
Then Kay-Em does a round house kick, but Jason uses his machete as a shield
Kay-Em's leg is nearly sliced off at the knee
She stumbles
falls to the ground
Kay-Em
Boeman splices the wires together
Done
Then turns to see Jason approaching
But Jason's too close
He grabs Boeman
- As her body separates from her legs mid-thigh
from her lower thighs
As Jason raises his machete to do Boeman in -- -
Kay-Em slams into him
Knocking Boeman free
Jason and the now hovering Kay-Em go at it again
Metal against metal
Kay-Em hovers up the walls, over Jason's head
but Jason has come into his own with these new body parts
She's no match
Finally -- -' Jason rears back and shoves his fist though Kay-Em's chestplate
his fist from Kay-Em's chest and wraps his metallic hand around he throat
Kay-Em
Get away
Thorgan moves toward his robotic love but Boeman grabs him and pulls him down the hall
- 14 That's the best you can do
Jason yanks his machete from the side of Kay-Em's neck
Severing her head from her body
It flies down the hallway behind the kids
- 14 Is that it
Come back and fight like a man
Turns his glare on our heroes racing toward Delongpre at the other end
Done
Delongpre lifts his welder's mask to call to the others when he sees Shit, hurry
Run toward the door
But, Thorgan stops
What
Thorgan turns, runs back toward Jason
What are you doing
Thorgan is running to retrieve Kay-Em 14's head
It lies between he and Jason
He'll never make it
Thorgan hits the floor, slides and scoops up the head
- 14 think 'm going to throw up
'
Jason raises his machete from his belt and -- (
) Hey, dickhead
-- -
Rizzo nails him with a metal ar
(to Thorgan) Go
Jason stumbles backwards then whirls on Rizzo
Oh, yeah, you remember me
He sure does
She turnsa dn runs
As the others race into the engien room they turn to watch
Hurry
Faster
Don't we have another gun
Rizzo catches up to Thorgan but they have a long way to go and Jason is gaining
They're not gonna make it
Close the door before he gets us all
They'll make it
Close the fucking door
leaps forward and hits the switch
The door begins sliding slowly shut
Damnit
Boeman hits the button again
(glares at Janessa) Forget it
had to rewire it
Once it's started it won't stop
Get ready to blow it
Rizzo dives, slides under the closing door
Thorgan follows her lead, but his slide doesn't have the same force
He stops with the door coming down on his lower back
Luckily, Delongpre snatches his arms and yanks him through
The door closes
Now
Boeman turns the switch
The charges
rushes toward the running
-
'
The walkway explodes, severing Grendel into two separate hulls
The left damaged hull, sinks out of view as the engine side begins to pull away
Then -- -
Grendel's   finallay
They barely amde it
The right hull  from the force of the blast
Our heroes are aireborne for a moment then crash to the floor
Damage
Boeman climbs to a console
Minimal
We made it
think
think maybe we did
Thorgan looks into Kay-Em 14's severed head
Kay-Em we made it
- 14 Oh, goody
'm so pleased
'd clap if  could
Boeman  on a console keyboard
've changed the course for Earth
And  sent a distress signal
(
) Roger, Grendel
What's the problem
(into mike) Our ship has been damaged, most of the crew dead
We need evac
Copy that Grendel
Rescue enroute
You should hit   orbit in fifteen minutes
Rescue  twenty minutes
We're going home people
More
Rizzo turns to find Delonpre staring at her
(big smile) See
We're not so bad
Not so bad
There's that moment when we think the two might kiss
She takes a step toward him
Yes, they are going to kiss -- The sound of
, still very alive shoves his fist through the imprinted door with his metal hand
As he rips a bigger hole to gain entrance our heroes are fighting to hold on to anything
The Hole is sucking everything not tied down out into space
Boeman is the first to reach the reactor room door
This way
He pulls Sergeant Brodski through the door as -- Fights his way through the opening in the hull
The engines  and begin to
The pressures cause the engines to overheat
Hurry
Delongpre helps Rizzo and Thorgan to safety
Janessa crawls across the floor digging her fingers into the steel mesh
Lying in the door's threshold reaches out and snags her hand
Pull me in
'm pulling, damnit
But Jason grabs Janessa's ankle and jerks
She's pulled from the Sergeant's grasp
She flops around in the sucking wind as Jason watches
He lets go
She flies toward the hole, slams into it
Everything goes quiet for a moment
As he body has sealed the hole then -- She's sucked into space in a most grotesque manner
Well, that's a shame
Hug cylindrical machines run the length of this enormous room
They  quietly as our group enters
We need weapons
Weapons
All this technology and what good has it done
It bought us some time
And now we're all out of it
Everyone stares at Boeman
He's standing at another console
The ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating
When it  reaches the core, we're done
Done
Kaboom
Again
Jesus
Why am  not surprised
Thorgan still clutches Kay-Em 14's severed head
- 14 You must shut down the engines
Then do it
The rescue ship can find us here right
Can't shut em' down from here
Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room
You ain't catching my ass in there again
Brodski, still bleeding, pale, struggling to stand -- 'll go
The kids give him the "are you crazy
" stare
You're too weak
'll go
-
Everyone jumps but this time it's only Rizzo
She broke a metal stand and has yanked one of the legs free
You know, this future shit sucks
'll fucking do it
You
(mumbling) Wait around on your asses all day
(turns to Thorgan) 'll need a distraction
What kind of a distraction
is pounding on the reactor room door
difficult act with the continued pressure trying to suck him into space
Jason turns to find Rizzo standing in the doorway behind him
You want some of me
Jason whirls around and lurches toward her clinging to machinery as he goes
Rizzo backs slowly as Jason closes in
As he reaches the corridor, she turns and runs
Come on, keep up
Jason barrels toward her
You want some of me or not
She stops at a door, but doesn't attmept ot open it
Jason comes closer
and closeer
but Rizzo doesn't move -- Jason moves in for the kill, raises his machete, and -- Take your best shot -- '
(laughs) 'm melting
'm melting
Her arm falls to the ground
See now that was stupid
Persistent, yes, but stupid
Jason shoves his fist, through her chest and into the wall
Not this time, asshole
This time 'm gonna watch you burn in hell
- The real  rips off her virtual reality helmet
Make it fast
He's coming
Delongpre is punching numbers into the keypad
Both are wearing headsets
Almost got it
As Jason returns to the engine room, none too pleased at being tricked
(
) Hurry up, guys
We've got the rescue ship on radar
Delongpre
Out of time
Got it
Rizzo jersk Delonpre and both spill into the reactor corridor
Rizzo slaps the panel
the door closes
Shutting out Jason's image
Damn that was close
door  in half
through
(into radio) Guys, he's right behind us
(
) It's okay
Okay
(
) Just come on, 've got an idea
They race down the long corridor toward the reactor room
Thorgan is typing like mad at small portable keyboard
Boeman stares out the docking bay window
There's damage, lots of it
(into radio) The docking bay was damaged after the explosion
Meet us at the airlock
corridor
Got it
(to Rizzo) You ever space walked
Oh sure, all the time
They leap through a door, closing it behind them, then keep running
-
Jason barrels right through the door
(into headset) Damit, Thorgan, whatever you're doing
you'd better hurry
(growls) hate the future
Rizzo and Delongpre enter in a  mad rush
Delongpre closes the door
Little good it'll do
kicks the door with his metallic leg
-
The door shatters and he stumlbes into -- Forest, cabins, the lake
Everything as we and Jason remember
But somehow distroted
strange hue covers everything
No, on second look, it's not exactly the way we remember
The trees are strange looking
Not the Pines and Oaks of Connecticut, but something foreign
The cabins look a little too advanced to be stuck in the middle of a camp
But the image will do
: - Thorgan stands at a keyboard clicking away
Boeman is wearing a space suit
He's helping sergeatn Brodski into his
At the other end of the huge room, Jason wanders
with confusion
Don't worry
He can't see us
Rizzo glances out the docking bay window
Is that
We see a planet much the same color as Earth, but the continents are wrong
Earth
(
) Suit up
Delongpre leads Rizzo to a suit
'll help you in
(into headset) Kay-Em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you
Kay-Em 14's head sits on the floor in the center of room
- 14 It was my pleasure, my love
Perhaps if all works for the best you can rebuild me and we can try that doggie style thing again
The others stare at Thorgan
he looks embarrassed to say the least
knew you were a little sick, but Geez
- - 14 (singing happily) get no kick from champaign, mere alcohol doesn't faze me at all, but  get a kick out of you
(under his breath) Goodbye, my love
(
) Thorgan, suit up
(to Rizzo) This is gonna work
If he sticks to the program
Will he
Stick to the program
His mother was killed before his eyes
That's what drove him insane
It'll work
That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit
Eat me
She smiles as she jersk the helmet out of his hand
Jason slowly walks beside Kay-Em 14
- : Jason is walking along the lake when he sees -- off in the distance
,
He takes off toward the campfire, then hears -- He turns
Within the distorted lake, someone is drowning
Could it be a little boy
little Jason from many years ago
Help me
(gurgles) Jason help me
Moves toward the beach
Steps partly into the water
,
' '
He turns toward the campfire, back to his mother
what to do
Then -- ,
Help me, Jason, please
Help your mother
Jason moves closer
Don't let me die again
As he draws near, she reaches out her hands to him
Pauses staring at the please for help
He stares into her pleading face
After all these years
He places his hand over her face, gently, then -- He holds her there
- : - 14 Uh-oh
That's not a part of the program
Thorgan, we've got a problem
Camp Cyrstal lake begins to jerk and fade
- Everyone is suited up
Delongpre, the last, is adjusting his helmet
(
) Oh, shit
He's going to see us
Well, do something
Thorgan grabs the portable keyboard and starts typing away
Suddenly the image solidifies then a number of the aliens from the game grid appear
But Jason's seen these guys before
He tears through them
- Shit
Boeman hits the door panel to the docking bay
It begins to slowly rise
Just a little more time
Jason stands atop a pile of dead alien like some strange Conan in space
The image flickers
he  catches a glimpse of our heroes at the end fo the room
He starts toward them
Then a huge white fluffy bunny with huge breasts appears before him
(sings; deep african american voice) 'm'a big fluffy bunny
a big white fluffy bunny
The bunny's head is severed
The image distortss
Again we see our heroes
Jason is closer
- The door is halway open
Our heroes start ducking under
Jason is almost on them
Thorgan
He's clicking away like a mad man
appears playing some futuristic metal
Then  in scantily clad outfits
Then a  in a cowboy hat riding by on a tricycle
We have now entered Thorgan's twisted streams of conciousness
Jason tears through the aboe
His goal now clear
The distractions no longer fool him
volley ball court appears with naked girls bouncing around
fat man wearing only a spiked leather Speedo
huge turtle
couple of goats
Nothing is stopping Jason
- Boeman reaches out and jerks Thorgan into the inner air lock
The image finally disintergrates
Jason finds himself staring at our heroes
He lunges for the air lock, but -- Sergeant Brodski dives, hitting Jason in the chest and knocking him to the floor
(
) Sergeant
(
) Get out of here
, still in Jason's clutches, kicks at the door panel
The door starts to close as Jason begins hacking with his machete
(
) That all you got
Jason hacks and hack, stabbing through the space suit, until finally, the tough old leather neck is silent for good
The door is sealed
He saved our lives
Boemen hits another button, and the outer door begins to open
Boeman, the ships not here
(
) Use the thrusters and you'll be fine
We'll huddle together out there
' ,
(
) Hey, easy now
He points to where her hand hovers over some buttons on her sleeve
(
) You wanna release your air tanks
(
) (nervous) Okay, good tip
(
) You'll be fine
(
) Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters
We'll be fine
(
) Why wouldn't we be
mean, look around
So far so good
Jason starts pounding from the other side
(
) Don't worry
He can't get through that door
Delongpre's right
This isn't some thin interior door or some walkway door reinforced by a high school kid
This is an air lock door
Built to withstand laser cannons and meteors
(
) Thrusters
Our group enters deep space
' Rizzo, Thorgan, Boeman and Delongpre look tiny next to the massive right hull
They thrust slowly into space
(
) Rizzo, you okay
(
) No 'm not okay
don't know what the hell 'm doing
(
) You're doing fine
won't let anything happen to you, remember
: Jason finally gives up with the massive pounding
He steps back
Turns, stares at the sergeants' dead body, then looks at -- He preses the button the ari lock door begins to open
Air is suddenly sucked out of the room
Sergeant Brodski's body flies out into space
Everything not tied down races out along with him
- 14' it skitters across the floor -- - 14 Ahhhhh
-- and right out the air lock holds onto a machine until the door is open, then lets go
He shoots out into space
Jason flies out of the air lock
He's rocketing right toward one of the space suits
(
) Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time
(
) think  had some when  was eight
(
) Did you like it
(
) think so, why
(
) He's trying to ask you out on a date
(
) Shut up, Thorgan
(
) Delongpre, you don't even know me
(
) know you
Suddenly Rizzo is  from behind
She and Jason go spinning away from the others
(
) Nooooooo
grapples with Jason, but
Jason holds  with his good hand and  his metallic hand back
He's going to punch a hole right through her helmet, most likely throat her head, when -- Delongpre rockets into Jason, but Jason's got one of his arms sticking through one of Rizzo's harnesses
THe three go tumbling
Delongpre clings to Jason's back
(
) Rizzo, pull away
(
) 'm stuck
Jason reaches back, grabs Delongpre and jersk him over his head until he's holding Delongpre around the thoat
He'll pop his helmet like a cork
Thorgan and Boeman thrust towards the tumbling mass
(
) We're too far away
he tightens his grip around Delongpre's neck
He can't fight back
is fighting to untangle her harness
We can hear Delongpre  over the radio
The three are spinning even closer and closer towards
Then, Rizzo reaches down
She grabs Delongpre's leg and  a button on her sleeve
-
But he's still tangled in Rizzo's hoses
And now she has no air
Jason turns
grabs the hoses and begins pulling himself toward Rizzo and Delongpre
He has them
when -- Still barely alive barrels into Jason, vlinging to his back
He turns, slashes with his knife and severs the hoses
Jason and Brodski tumble towards
Rizzo's turning blue
She's about to pass out, when -- Delongpre pulls a hose from his suit and hooks it into her tank
Rizzo takes a big
coughs
(
) You okay
(
) (breathing steadily) Oh great
yeah, having a great time, and you
(
) No thank you, you crazy old woman
(
) Old woman
(
) Well  mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great
(
) get it
Suddenly Boeman and Thorgan grab them
The four survivors huddle together
- 14 Hello
little assistance here
They turn to see Kay-Em's head floating close by
Thorgan graps at her and pulls her head into his arms
(
) Kay-em you okay
- 14 am now
missed you, Thorgan
(
) missed you too
- 14 love you
Those two aren't the only two
Their glass face masks are touching
They stare into each other's eyes
(
) Chinese, huh
They laugh and turn to stare toward
-- Suddenly Jason's body comes into view
It's racing toward Earth
Brodski riding it like Slim Pickens
Yeee---Haaaaa
Slowly they begin entering the atmosphere
Immediately Brodski is engulfed in flames and is gone
He was a good man
stay to the end to make sure the job was done right
Spread eagle and alone, facing the planet below, Jason continues his descent
His fingers wiggle as his chrome mask begins to heat up
It begins to glow
His metallic arm and leg glow
Flames build as he rockets towards Earth
Flesh  and
His legs and arms begin to flail as hunks of burning flesh fall from his body
Four kids sit on futuristic sleeping bags around an old fashion campfire
# 1 Hey
Check that out
They look up and see a blaze shooting towards Earth
# 2 falling star
# 3 It's a meteor dickhead
# 2 It's still cool
It  up the night, then -- # 1 Cool
From the explosion, one small smoldering chunk falls toward Earth
As the chunk falls closer and closer we see that it is a glowing chrome hockey mask
with a
# 4 Damn
It his the reservoir
# 1 Let's go check it out
The others agree as they grab their flashlights and head in toward what could be a wonderful new discovery
: The hockey mask washes down the stream, comes to a halt at a pair of grusomely charred hands
, , curl around the mask, lifting it off camera
