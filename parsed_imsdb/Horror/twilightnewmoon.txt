: Written By Melissa Rosenberg Adapted from the Novel by Stephenie Meyer Dec
21, 2008 : -- Luminous, tinged with gold
Slowly, a penumbral shadow begins to spread across the moon's surface, darkening it from left to right
(
) "These violent delights have violent ends
" until the moon is enveloped in shadow; a new moon
which disappears into the darkness
-    appears, isolated against the blackness
(
) "
And in their triumph die, like fire and powder
" the tulip as the background   around it to reveal we're now in -- -     - It's surrounded by the dark, lush, greenery of the forest floor
(
) "
Which, as they kiss, consume
" next to the tulip, nearly crushing it
As the foot immediately lifts off again, it grazes the tulip, knocking its petals off -- They abruptly change direction
Race on , desperately searching the woods -- , of her frenetic quest -- Edward
Ahead, through the darkness of the thick forest, she ; a clearing
She hurtles toward it -- - Edward

-- as Bella bursts into the sunlight
It's the meadow where Edward revealed his skin in the sun
But he's not here now
Instead, Bella  -- --   , white hair framing her withered face
Bella's eyes widen with surprise as she recognizes -- Gran
looks as surprised as Bella
Bella smiles and waves, as does Gran
Bella starts toward her but -- (
) Bella
She spins to the voice behind her to  -- emerge from the forest, his alabaster skin in sharp contrast to the shadows
She beams at him, relieved, in love
until he moves to edge of the shade, inches from sun's rays -- Stop - she'll see
But Edward just smiles and steps into the sunlight
Sunbeams  off his skin like a thousand rainbow shards, as if he were made of diamonds
An awesome sight
: Edward now inches from Bella, still glistening, entrancing her
She wraps an arm around his waist, then arranges her face into a calm expression
They turn to -- Gran, whose expression is calm, too
Gran's arm is extended, as if she also holds someone
: Bella and Edward, only feet from Gran now
Bella's about to present Edward, but then  that -- Gran mimics Bella's movement exactly
With growing horror, Bella reaches out to Gran
and touches glass
Gran is now surrounded by a
It's a , mounted on a wall with wallpaper reflecting a surreal dreamlike version of the forest behind Bella
Oh my God
-- as she realizes that's not Gran; it's Bella, sixty-five years older
3
Bella spins to her perfect, eternally 17-year-old Edward
He takes her now , age-spotted hand
Kisses it
Then he leans in very close to her 83--  and whispers into her ear -- Happy birthday
: '  - - her eyes snap open
She lies atop her bed book, "  ," lays open on her chest
Bella sits up, the dream still weighing on her
, cluttered with pictures of Edward, of the Cullens; memorabilia of all things Edward
on the door
enters carrying two gifts, one wrapped, one not
Happy birthday, Bells
Dad, we agreed, no gifts
At least mine's not wrapped
He hands it to her
It's a digital camera
Bella's pleased, despite herself
Okay, this is actually kind of great
Thanks, Dad
(re: wrapped gift) Goes with this one from your mom
We coordinated - well, she coordinated me
Bella opens the wrapped gift to reveal a
To put your pictures in, record your senior year -- man, senior year
How'd you get so old so fast
Not that old
4
don't know
Is that a wrinkle
Bella races to the mirror, searches her face
was kidding
So not funny, Dad
- An   of this lush, green, overcast landscape; the rainy world that is Forks
Bella's old truck as it lumbers down the two-lane highway
(
) It was just a dream
but also my worst nightmare
-   - Bella climbs out of her truck, shouldering her book bag
She looks around the parking lot, seeking Edward -- (
) Wherefore art thou, Bella
She turns as , ,  and  approach
You finish the Shakespeare assignment
He means will you finish his assignment
No,  don't -- okay  do
can help you with it -- but first -- (pulling out her camera) need a picture
My mom's expecting a scrapbook full of memories
(holds up her own camera) take `em,  don't pose for `em
You do today
5
She pushes Angela to the others; they arrange themselves -- You'll photoshop my nose if it looks big, right
Don't worry, 'm in the picture; no one will be looking at you guys
Jessica scoffs, Angela points her camera at Bella; Mike and Eric joust -- Bella aims -- -  ' It  on them, fun, delightfully carefree
but when the camera lowers, their playfulness has dissipated as they see someone behind Bella
She turns to see -- climbing out of his silver Volvo
(dry) Oh good
Cullen's here
(drier) Yay
The friends, uncomfortable, move off -- Check ya later
-- But Bella doesn't register their tone
She's transfixed by Edward who approaches, eyes never leaving hers
He reaches her, washing away all her concerns -- Happy birthday
-- except that one
Her face falls
Don't remind me
Your birth is definitely a day to celebrate
Not for me
6
Eighteen is a little early to be worrying about your age
It's one year older than you
Bella, 'm ninety
True
Maybe  should be creeped out that 'm dating such an old guy
(smiles, amused) Yes, it's the age that's creepy, not the fact that you're dating a vampire
Then he kisses her, tenderly, adoringly
She kisses him back
despite their restraint, the passion mounts
until he pulls away
As always, both are left wanting more
Edward nods toward the school building -- Class
Right
Class
Catching their breath, they start toward school
but Edward stops, hearing something in his mind
Irritated
Someone wants you
(
) Bella
, 16, jogs up, carrying a used car part, long, black ponytail wagging
He looks 18 due to his tall, muscular body, but the gregarious Jacob is a little klutzy, still catching up to his growth spurt
He nods to Edward, who moves off to the side but eyes them
God, Jacob, what are they feeding you on that rez, steroids
You're huge
Wouldn't seem so drastic if you came around more
7
will, soon
But isn't your school, like, ten miles that way
(re: car part) Just here buying this for the Rabbit
'm almost done with the rebuild
Gotta come take a ride when it's done
(as if remembering) Oh, and hey, happy birthday
Your dad told my dad
So
He pulls from his coat a small woven , feathers dangling from it
He hands it to her
saw it the other day and thought of you - it catches bad dreams
This,  need
It's great
The bell's about to ring
The bell
Jacob gives Edward an amiable smile, with just a hint of snark
Ooh, look at you, all psychic
don't have that particular gift
But  can read a watch
'm clever that way
They share a tight smile
Bella intercedes, squeezing Jacob's arm
Bye, Jake, and thank you
Edward guides her away
As they walk off -- How come Jacob Black gets to give you a gift and  don't
He's just a friend
8
"Friends" don't spend two weeks looking for the perfect dreamcatcher
Stop reading his mind if he bothers you so much
Little hard to tune out
She just laughs, but Edward looks back at Jacob with resentment
Jacob holds his gaze
-  - Edward and Bella enter the double doors -- suddenly a small, wrapped gift appears in Bella's face
presents it
Happy -- Shh
-- Alice whispers in her ear as she hugs Bella -- -- birthday
Over Alice's shoulder, Bella sees , keeping his distance
He offers her a pleasant nod
She tries to hide Alice's present, hoping no one noticed -- Alice, didn't  say no gifts
You did
didn't
've already seen you open it and guess what
You love it
You had a vision about my birthday
And about the green dress you'll be wearing to your party tonight
Great color on you
My party
9
Please
It'll be fun
(beat, confused) guess  can deal -- (hurriedly) -- Great
See ya at seven
Alice hugs her again and races off before she can change her mind
Which is when Bella realizes -- Wait, Jasper, no fair with the mood control
He offers an apologetic bow before Alice drags him away
Vampires
You can't trust them
: - Zeffirelli's `68 "Romeo and Juliet" plays
The suicide scene
Arms, take your last embrace, and lips,  you, the doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
-- -   - The room is dark as we   the class, some students entertained, some moved, Mike trying not to fall asleep
The teacher,
, mouths every word -- Here's to my love
(drinks) true apothecary
Thy drugs are quick
Edward and Bella in the back of the room, desks pushed together, whisper-talking
hate being
celebrated
10
Come on, the last real birthday any of us had was Emmett's -  think Bing Crosby was on top of the charts
(then) You'll be helping us feel normal for a night
Bella sits back, knowing she's trapped
He kisses her hand
There are worse tragedies than a birthday
Look at Romeo
He's responsible for his wife's death
Who could live with that
(looks at the screen) Though  do envy him one thing
(blanches slightly) Juliet's alright
if you like that obviously beautiful sort of thing
Not the girl - the suicide
(off her look) Nearly impossible for my kind
But humans, a little poison, dagger to the heart
There are so many options
(appalled) Why would you even think about that
He turns her wrist over, runs his hand over the horseshoe shaped  on her forearm
(shrugs) considered it
Once
When James had you trapped
"Twilight" - In the ballet studio,  grabs Bella's arm and  -- - pained
didn't know if 'd find you in time
If 'd gotten you killed -- It wouldn't have been your fault -- 11
Either way,  had a plan
What plan
There are
ways for us
At least one way
would have gone to Italy, provoked the Volturi
The who
Is there something you'd like to share with the class, Edward
(politely) Certainly not
But  apologize for being a distraction
Perhaps you should rewind to act five, scene one, line twenty-eight eighty-nine -- (reciting) "If you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight
" Mr
Berty just looks at him, then moves off, intimidated -- Eyes on the screen, people
Bella is too concerned to be amused
- Lights glow from inside the beautiful house
(
) The Volturi are a very old, very powerful family
- '  - 18TH   , depicting Grecian figures in swirling robes writhing among pillars and balconies
In a high balcony,    look down upon the bacchanal; two black haired, one snowy white, one golden haired
(
) The closest thing my world has to royalty
12
-- Edward and Bella (now wearing a green dress)
She studies the painting - the largest on a wall crowded with pictures
The other walls are towering bookshelves
Francesco Solimena painted this; he often depicted the Volturi as Gods
Bella examines the golden haired "God
" Is that
Carlisle
Yes
He lived with them for a few decades
He describes them as very refined - for killers
, Their features begin to fill in, become real - in the painting, turning to leave the balcony through an archway
We   into -- - It's centuries old, its marble cracked and weathered
The open oculus in the domed ceiling is the only source of light
The room is empty but for three large wooden chairs and half a dozen  in elegant 18th century attire
(
) The Volturi are also what you might call enforcers
(
) Of what
(
) The only rule they have: to keep secret the existence of our kind
Two of the Volturi,  and , take their seats, Carlisle stands beside them
moves to the center of the room where we  -- is on his knees
He looks feral compared to the others, and terrified
Aro puts his hands on either side of the Rogue's face
Compassion
13
(
) We don't make spectacles of ourselves, or kill conspicuously, unless we want to die
Aro then slowly, dispassionately,   '
Two Volturi Guards ( and ) appear on either side, holding him down as Aro easily detaches the head and tosses it aside
Aro calmly sits as the others tear the Rogue limb from limb
Carlisle has to look away
- '  - -- as Bella spins on Edward -- Don't even -- talk about that
You can't let anyone hurt you
The Volturi or anyone else
(sees she's worried) Who else would hurt me
You said there were more dangerous things out there than you
And  know you have at least one enemy -- '  - : --     , James, , the dread- locked  (from "Twilight") --    - fire-red hair, burgundy red eyes, feral, vicious grin (from "Twilight") (
) You said she'd come after you for killing her mate
Victoria
Yes, some day
But Alice will see her coming
And she won't win
Bella looks up at him, pained
hate that  can't protect you
He laughs, amused
She's decidedly not
14
That was me being serious
(kissing her face) know
But you do protect me
(kisses her nose) From boredom
(kisses her lips) And loneliness
(in between kisses) You give me a reason to stay
un- dead
But it's
my job; to protect you
-- but he stops, smiles, hearing something in his mind -- from everyone but my sister
-- as the door bursts open and Alice dances in
It's time it's time it's time
-    - Alice tugs Bella and Edward to the top of the landing, then skips down the stairs
They look down into -- - Hundreds of pink candles and rose-filled crystal bowls
, , , Carlisle, Jasper and Alice look up at her, all of them stunningly beautiful
Bella would love to disappear, but Edward leads her down to -- -- where Esme and Carlisle hug Bella warmly
Sorry about all this
We tried to rein Alice in
Like that's even possible
Happy birthday, Bella
Alice has snapped a picture of Bella with them
(re: camera) Found it in your bag
Mind
Emmett moves to Edward's side
Nudges him
15
Dating an older woman
Hot
Bella caught that
Edward elbows him sharply to shut up
What
Rosalie steps up
Shoves a silver package at Bella
It's a necklace
Alice picked it out
She walks away, bored
Bella has to smile
She sees Jasper across the room
They wave to each other
(aims the camera) Show me the love
Edward pulls Bella into an embrace, they look deeply into one another's eyes
For your scrapbook
Now open your presents
Alice drags Bella over to a table piled with elaborately wrapped gifts, a huge cake and a tall stack of china plates
Alice, 'm the only one who even eats cake
That thing could feed fifty
Hope you're hungry
Here, this one's from Emmett
The others crowd around
Jasper somewhat away
Bella, no fan of being the center of attention, opens the gift to find an empty car-radio box
Um
thanks
Already installed it in your truck
Finally, a decent sound system in that piece of -- 16
No hating on the truck
Thank you, Emmett
Open mine
Alice hands her a box
Bella starts to open it, but -- Ouch - paper cut
'  -  single drop of deep red blood appears
Bella thinks little of it, but then  a disturbing, grisly  -- she looks up just as -- '  -  lunges toward her
Teeth bared, eyes beyond reason -- -- Edward  Bella behind his own body, causing her to into the table, plates shattering as -- -- Jasper  into Edward; sounds like boulders colliding
-- Edward pushes him, hard; Jasper  backward, hitting the wall
But he  off it and comes back at Bella
-- Emmett and Carlisle  Jasper from the side, dragging him to the ground -- Alice helps hold him down -- (soothingly) Jaz
shhh -- But she stops, her head suddenly jerking toward Bella
Then everybody's eyes snap toward Bella as they catch the overwhelming scent -- - lying amid the shards of broken china
She looks at her arm, seeing now - it's been slashed by plate shards; bright red blood pulses out of her, pooling
She looks up -- '  -   ( ) All of them now, including Edward (but not Carlisle) stare down at her, at her blood, with fevered eyes
Six suddenly ravenous vampires
as -- Carlisle jumps to Bella's side
Edward, though white as a bone, snaps out of it and stands between her and the others
17
Emmett, get Jasper out of here
(no response) Emmett
Emmett reins himself in, elbows Rosalie
They drag the snarling Jasper out
Esme holds her nose, politely exits with the others
Alice looks at Bella, apologetic -- 'm sorry,
can't
She slips out the door
Edward's still on guard as Carlisle examines Bella's arm
'll have to stitch this up
'll carry her to the kitchen
He moves to pick her up, but his eyes dart to the blood
'll take care of her, Edward
(Edward doesn't move) Check on Jasper
Go
Edward looks from him to Bella
Then steps back, allowing Carlisle to lift Bella and carry her to the kitchen
But just before the kitchen door closes, Bella sees Edward's agonized face
He turns away, unable to meet her eyes
-  - Bella sits in a chair opposite Carlisle who mops up her blood as he removes glass shards from her arm
He drops one into a bowl;
She tries not to look at the blood
sure can kill a party
It's not your fault
Jasper hasn't been away from human blood as long as the rest of us
Seems like you're the only one it doesn't effect
Centuries of practice
18
Did you ever think of
living differently
enjoy   my work too much
Helping people,   saving lives
'm hoping there's   a point to my existence, even if  am   damned
Damned
You're not damned
Then you and  agree
But Edward doesn't believe there's an afterlife for our kind
(looking at her) He thinks we've lost our souls
(realizing) That's why he won't
He thinks he'd be damning me
(') If you believed as he did, would you risk it
Off Bella, no, not ever
'  - large red bow hangs from the new stereo in the dashboard
Edward drives in silence
Bella studies him
Finally -- Say something
What do you want me to say
That 'm a klutz
That  should have been more careful -- You got a paper cut
Normal people get paper cuts
And a normal boyfriend wouldn't have flung you into a stack of plates
normal boyfriend wouldn't have had to fight the urge to kill you -- 19
Stop
don't want normal,  want you
Edward doesn't respond, just pulls the truck into -- ' /
'  () - The truck stops
Beat
You can't protect me from everything - something's going to separate us -- accident, illness, old age
as long as 'm human
(appalled) That's your solution
My ending your life
Your giving me forever
He faces forward again, jaw tight, mind working, tormented
She reaches for his hand -- Carlisle told me how you feel, about my soul, but  don't believe that -- -- he subtly moves his hand away from hers
You should go in
It's late
He climbs out - instantly he's opening the passenger side door for her
She climbs out
He looks down at her face - he softens as he takes it in
Puts a hand on her cheek
'll leave my window open for you
(quietly) won't be coming back
Not tonight
Then
can  ask for one thing
It's still my birthday
(off his nod) Kiss me
20
He lifts her face to his, and kisses her
He begins carefully, gently
but it changes, he becomes urgent, with an almost painful edge, as if it were goodbye
Abruptly, he pulls away
With a last look, he turns walks off into the night
Off Bella
'  - - as a printer spits it out
It's the pic Alice took of Bella and Edward's embrace
Bella, troubled, puts it in her scrapbook, her bandaged finger running over it
-   - "Romeo and Juliet" lessons are on the board
Everyone's scribbling essays
Bella glances at Edward's desk; empty -- -- (previous scene in truck)   ' , hard, turning away from her
-  - Bella sits with Jessica, Angela, Eric and Mike
They joke, throw things
Bella's distracted, looking-out for Edward
-- (scene in the truck)   ' moving away from hers
'  , off which we go to -- '  - the photos on the wall
who studies them, his expression grim
He looks down at Bella's to  the photo of him and Bella
He pulls it out, takes a closer look
'  - of her truck as she pulls into the driveway
She climbs out, heads toward the house but stops, relief washing over her -- Edward
You're here
He stands by the house
Bella hurries toward him, but slows when she sees his cold, distant face; an unreadable mask
Walk with me
21
Edward gently takes her hand
Dread fills her, but she lets him guide her toward the woods
- Edward stops by a fallen tree
Turns to Bella
We need to leave Forks
What
Why
It's time
Carlisle's supposed to be ten years older than he looks; people will start noticing
But
when
Now
Bella reels, trying to take this in
Finally -- 'll have to think of something to tell Charlie, but  can be ready -- Not you
Us
(stunned) What
-- no -- Edward, what happened with Jasper - that was nothing
Nothing compared to what could happen
You don't belong in my world
--  belong with you -- -- You don't -- -- 'm coming -- don't want you to come
22
Bella is stung, as if slapped
You don't
want me
No
She steps back
Trying to understand this
'd like to ask one favor though
(looks up, hopeful) Anything
Don't do anything stupid or reckless -- do you understand
(adding) for Charlie's sake
Just
take care of yourself
yes
will
He softens ever-so-slightly
Don't worry
You're human
Time heals all wounds for your kind
Particularly if you're not reminded
Desperation wells up in her, overwhelming dignity
No, this is - don't do this
Please
He sees she won't let go easily
Takes a breath
His face turns cold again
Try to understand
Every second with you is about restraint
You're too fragile
'm tired of pretending to be something 'm not
Reining myself in so  can be with a human
Then take my soul
don't care don't want it without you -- 23
(sharply) -- You're not good for me, Bella
Bella looks at him
His hard face
His resolve
've let it go on too long
'm sorry
Tears sting Bella's eyes
This can't be happening
He steps forward
kisses her forehead
She closes her eyes
promise, it will be like  never existed
Goodbye, Bella
And here, for the first time, we  how truly agonizing this really is for Edward
But Bella doesn't see
By the time she opens her eyes - he's gone
She spins -- -- Wait -- She  a   to the ground where he grazed a branch; the only indication of his direction
She hurries down the path, then runs -- Edward
-- and she keeps running, going deeper into the woods
,   - Bella runs through the woods, searching, reminiscent of her opening dream
It gets darker and darker, until we're deep into night --  Bella's sharp desperate  -- Falls to the damp forest floor
She looks up, the trees spinning around her
-  - She remains on the ground
Curls into a ball
Darkness shrouding her
Devastation paralyzing her
- numb
the faint sound of her name being called in the distance
search party
She's too wrecked to respond
Rain begins to pour; she doesn't register it
24
-- , lying there, dazed
She begins to  an animal
It gets closer
It sounds large
Scary
Then she hears a whisper -- (
) Move, Bella
She lifts her head, looks for Edward
but  something else instead -- '  -   , huge, black
Nearing
Its reflect light for a split second; they're inhuman, savage
Bella, terrified, manages to  herself to a cluster of trees
She squeezes between them
Breathing hard
She closes her eyes, trying to disappear
- Bella's eyes open to find herself  several feet above the ground
Trees pass by
She's being carried
'  - Half the town is gathered - a tired rescue party that includes Mike Newton and Jacob Black
Charlie, beside himself with worry, pores over a map with (in wheelchair) and Quileute  , 46, (dark braids, stout, protruding belly, kind face)
'll call the Cullens again
Her note said she and Edward went for a walk
They left town, Charlie
Hospital said Doc Cullen got a big job somewhere else
Harry puts a reassuring hand on Charlie's shoulder
We'll find her, Charlie
Charlie is glad for the comfort of his two friends
Charlie
Charlie spins to where Jacob points -- 25
- , 20, emerges, a tall, strong Quileute Indian with cropped hair and a fierce expression
He's carrying Bella
It's Sam Uley
He found her
Charlie bolts to her; he's never moved faster in his life
He wraps his arms around Bella, lifting her from Sam's arms
Thank you, Sam
Thank God
Charlie carries Bella to the house, cradling her
Harry and Billy give Sam a nod of praise and gratitude
But Sam backs away, avoiding any accolades
- jogging alongside Charlie, peering at Bella with worry
Then Jacob slows, feeling eyes on his back
he turns to  Sam Uley staring at him
Jacob, uncomfortable, quickly looks away
up the stairs to the house -- What were you thinking, Baby
Why were you out there
He's
gone
Off her as Charlie carries her inside -- '  - - Charlie lays Bella down and wraps her in blankets
She's curled in a fetal position in the middle of the bed
Then at its foot
Under the blankets
On top of them
In various different arrangements
Meanwhile
begins to flood the floor, slowly swallowing everything in the room
It rises up the sides of the bed, higher and higher until it breaches the top of the bed and begins to engulf Bella
Off her, submerged in blackness
26
'  -  - The leaves have turned red and orange
a  in the upstairs window -- '  - Bella sits in a rocking chair by the window
Her face blank
Empty
, unchanging - but , we    behind her -- -- Costumed kids appear in the yard, trick-or- treating
--  (  and his ) bring Charlie a turkey
they glance up at Bella's window with concern
-- the trees' branches are now bare
-- Charlie drags a Christmas tree toward the house
worry has taken its toll on him
But Bella remains unchanged
(
) Dear Mom
'm
(beat) lost
the now blank walls of the exceedingly neat room; gone are all traces of Edward
(
) Edward took everything with him
Including my life
He promised it would be like he never existed
the scrapbook which lies open; the photo of Bella and Edward's embrace at the birthday party - gone
'  - , typing an e-mail to Renee
(
) But  need to know he did
,    : --
'  -   - Bella sits on the couch, blank, as the rain pounds
Charlie watches her, concerned
27
(
) It's like a huge hole has been punched through my chest
--
'  - In the darkness, Bella is curled up in a ball on her floor
(
) But the pain is my only reminder that he was real
that they all were
--
-  - Lunch
Bella sits alone, staring straight ahead Jessica, Eric, Angela and Mike, watching her with concern
Talking about her
She doesn't notice
(
) miss them
Especially Alice
'   - one-story contemporary home, surrounded by snowy, barren land and woods
Through a    we  Alice and Carlisle, arguing inside -- (
) But 'm sure it's better for them, not having me around
'   () - Alice faces off with Carlisle as the others watch on
Esme desolate; Emmett blank
He sits next to Rosalie who seems almost irritated
Jasper isolates himself in a corner
No
We promised Edward
But she won't do well without us
get flashes of her, but they're unclear -- Forget her, let's drag Edward home
He'll come back when he's ready
After Bella moves on
28
Yes
When she's living her life, safe from danger -- (with self-contempt) You mean safe from us
Alice wraps an arm around Jasper, soothingly
(pointedly to Alice) And when will that be
Can you see him, Alice
They all turn to Alice
a beat
She closes her eyes, trying to get a lock on Edward --     as -- The only decision he's made
: -  (' ) - (Visuals are jumpy, unclear)      in the middle of nowhere
to its peak on which we find
Standing still, face agonized
(
) is to be alone
-- and suddenly, he starts running, like he's trying to outrun his memories, faster and faster -- he races toward a ; a  hundreds of feet below -- Edward doesn't slow, just blasts forward faster; then he off the cliff, , but the pain stays with him -- '  landing hard on the other side of the ravine - as they hit ground we -- : ' -- as they hit computer keys -- (
) Time passes
Every tick that goes by
aches
29
'  - '  , as she types
(
) Like the pulse of blood behind a bruise
Bella stops
beat as she stares at her own words
Then she hits "select all" and "delete" -- -
She types: "Hi Mom, things are great, grades are up
Hanging with friends
Stop worrying
'm fine
" Bella presses "send", and the cheery e-mail disappears
Bella rises, returns to her rocking chair, staring out desolately
- -- Someone's watching her, pacing menacingly, hungrily
: '  - Bella exits to find Charlie out by the street, stuffing trash into the bins
He talks with neighbor, Bob Marks, who also attends to his trash: two old, beat up motorcycles
It's about time you got rid of those, Bob
Seen one too many bikers smeared on the highway
Save the lecture, Chief
Soon as the garbage truck hauls `em off, you and my wife can rest easy
(starts off, but stops) Oh, hey, what's the word on that bear problem
Folks are saying they're huge
(distracted) That's just
talk
-- as Charlie watches Bella walk to her truck, head down
Bob sees her, too -- How you doin' there, Bella
30
Bella, in her own world, doesn't respond
Bob gives Charlie an understanding shrug and heads off
as she opens her truck door
Suddenly, it gets slammed shut again by Charlie
That's it
That's what
You're going to Jacksonville to live with your mother
What
Why
just - don't know what to do any more
You don't act like someone left you; more like someone died
She looks away
That's how it feels to her
'm not leaving Forks
Bells, the bastard's not coming back
She nods
Knows this all too well
It's not normal, this behavior
And frankly, it's scaring the hell outta me, and your mother
(gentler) Go to Jacksonville, Baby
Make some new friends
like my old friends
You never even see them anymore
do, too
In fact, 'm
um
Jessica and  are going to Port Angeles tomorrow
Shopping
31
(suspicious) You hate shopping
That's how good a friend  am
(somewhat appeased) Alright
Shopping
(-) Hi Jessica, it's Bella
'  - Bella drives, talking on her cell (hands-free, of course)
Yes, Bella Swan
Hey, any chance you feel like shopping tomorrow
-   - Bella and Jessica exit the theater
behind them bears the title of a  film
don't get why are there so many zombie movies
It's, like, a metaphor
For crass consumerism or something
Bella glances at her
Not that you'd know anything about consuming
You didn't buy anything today
bought something
Socks don't count
`Course,  was surprised you even called
've been kind of
out of it
32
Kind of
mean, at first  was worried
Then 'm like, okay, she's still bumming
It's not like  wasn't going through things, too
Like Mike deciding he wanted to "just be friends
" That was really hard and -- '  (
) How `bout a ride, girls
As Bella looks   , time suddenly  -- '  -   , "  '" ( ) --  -  loiter out front next to their motorcycles
They're in shadow, we can't see their faces
-- : Bella surrounded by   ("Twilight"); Edward's Volvo skidding to a stop; Edward staring them down -- , a chill going down her spine,  her as she stares at the foursome across the street
Then suddenly -- a pair of lips lean next to her ear -- (
) Move, Bella
She turns to find Edward standing next to her
Or so it seems
But he's an illusion; an apparition - which becomes clear when -- Jessica steps right into him, dissolving him to nothingness, and -- Come on
know them
think
Can we just go -- Jessica pulls at her arm, but Bella shakes her off
want to see something
33
Much to Jessica's frustration, Bella begins to cross the street toward the Guys, frightened but drawn
#1 Alright, we got a taker
The apparition of   in her path this time
She stops
Turn around, Bella
This is dangerous
But when she steps backward, he fades
Testing her hallucination, she strides forward again -- Edward's apparition reappears, strides alongside her -- Stop
Now
She's almost smiling as she reaches the Guys, finally able to see them clearly -- and stops, realizing -- You're not them
And with that
Edward disappears
#1 We'll be whoever you want, honey
Guy #2 pulls up right next to her on his motorcycle
#2 Ready for a thrill ride
#2 extends his hand to help her onto the bike
She hesitates
(
) Walk away
Go
Edward's apparition appears on the other side of the bike
Bella looks at him with determination -- then climbs on to the back of the bike -- can break promises, too
#2 (confused) Okay
34
Bella
The bike  forward, going way too fast
As the wind blasts her hair back, she realizes this might have been a mistake -- Wait Guy #2 doesn't hear her, guns the engine, going faster -- '  - Edward stands in road, directly in their path, more present, more clear than ever
The bike's headlight illuminates him, racing toward him -- Stop - stop
-
The bike abruptly pulls up short
#2 Hey,  didn't force nothing on you
Bella scrambles off, stumbling in the process
Edward is gone
The four Guys then  their bikes and  out
Bella watches them go as Jessica storms up
What the hell is wrong with you
(almost to herself) saw something
You
Are insane
Or suicidal
(trying to figure it out) The more dangerous
the more real it was
So, what, you're like an adrenaline junky now
Go hang-gliding or bungie- jumping
Don't be a complete freak
35
An angry Jessica charges off
Bella watches the motorcycles disappear down the street as -- (
) He wasn't real
knew that didn't care
needed to see him
If danger's what it took, that's what 'd find
Off Bella, determination settling into her face
'  - Bella pulls up in her truck, a tarp covering something big in the back
Jacob comes out of the house
huge grin
Bella
Bella hops out, Jacob gives her a hug
Bella's surprised by his affection, but doesn't mind
`Bout time you came by
brought you something
Bella pulls the tarp back, revealing - her neighbor's two dilapidated, rusting
Scrap metal
You shouldn't have
rescued them from the dump
They'd cost more than they're worth to fix
unless one had a mechanic-type friend
Me, being the mechanic-type friend
(off her shrug) Since when are you into motorcycles
Recently
(studying the bikes) The parts alone will be pricey
have a college fund  can dig into
36
Charlie's gonna love that
Charlie won't know
Wow
Lying to Dad
Blowing through college money
Repairing dangerous machines - that 'm guessing you'll want to ride
really get it if you think this is stupid and reckless
Oh it's totally stupid and reckless
(leans closer, grins) When do we start
Bella face spreads into something we haven't seen in a while
a wide smile
As they pull the bikes off the truck, they laugh and joke; it's as though Jacob has brought Bella back to life
But -- - -- someone's watching as the two of them wheel the bikes into the garage
on the watcher to discover -- -   - Next to Sam stand two others, , 17, and , 18
All three have cropped hair, sleeveless shirts, cut-offs
It's unsettling how they watch Bella and Jacob; the ferocity in their eyes, the danger
Sam turns; the others follow his lead
The three slink soundlessly into the darkness of the woods
: - Two hikers,  and , 20's, as they tromp through the shadowy, mist-laden woods
Tim studies his IPhone  -- We're going the wrong way
Who cares
Enjoy the scenery
37
(slapping a mosquito) And the West Nile virus
Tim hears a
Stops
You hear that
If  knew you were such a wuss, 'd have brought my grandma
Could be one of those giant bears
There are no giant -- Nate stops
Then, from the opposite direction, another
Then another, and another, from behind, from in front
It's either more than one creature or it's moving with extraordinary speed
The guys are terrified
What the hell is that
don't know
The guys, faced away from one another, search the trees
as suddenly, there's an eerie
Beat
Think it's gone
No answer
He turns to find that Nate has vanished
Nate
Nate
Nothing
then the  starts again
And intensifies
Tim
- tearing through the woods, too scared to feel the branches  him in the face
Breath ragged, he looks over his shoulder -- '  -   - something gives chase, flattening foliage and bending thin trees in its path
Tim runs harder -- '  -      - couple cars pass
Civilization
Safety
Tim races for it -- 38
() Tim bursts from the tree-line, he's almost to the pavement, he`s going to escape -- Something  him out of frame at an unnatural angle
His  is abruptly choked off, leaving nothing but a disturbing silence
: '  - Motorcycle parts are spread out on blankets
Jacob moves among them excitedly, piecing them together
Bella watches
If we're going to be working on this every day, we should probably include some homework
Don't want the Dads to think 'm a bad influence on you
You influence me
Please
am older than you
Age ain't nothin' but a number
And  convinced you to secretly build us two-wheeled death machines
(sudden mock-horror) God, you're right, you're like Satan -- (
) Yo, Jake, you in there
Bella abruptly sits up, starts to pull a tarp over the bikes
It's cool, it's just my boys
and   enter, both 16
Quil is short, stocky and feisty, with short hair
Embry is tall, thin and laid back, with chin-length black hair
Hey, Jake -- 39
They stop when they see Bella
The two guys share a smile
Hey
This is Bella
Bella, that's Quil and Embry
So the bike building story is true
Taught him everything he knows
What about the part where you're his girlfriend
Oh, we're just friends
Ooh
Burn
(scrambling) said she's a girl and a friend
Embry, you remember him making that distinction
Nope
Bella rescues Jacob -- So  guess you guys have girlfriends
(laughs loudly) Right
Quil took his cousin to prom
Embry chuckles, as well
Yeah, that's still a riot
You want funny, Black
'll give you funny
Quil makes a run at him, he dodges; a playful scuffle ensues
Embry, amused, saunters over to Bella
got five bucks on Quil
40
You're on
The scuffle continues
Off Bella, enjoying them
'  - The bikes begin to take shape, the parts on the blanket thin out
(
) never forgot my reason for doing what  was doing
Jacob clowns for Bella's amusement, pretends to skewer himself with a pipe
She laughs
(
) But being with Jacob was a bigger perk than  expected
He constantly touches her, playful, affectionate
It's effortless in contrast to Edward's intense restraint
We can see her spirits beginning to lift
'  - Bella and Jacob exit, make their way across the yard to her truck
Bella seems lighter, happier than before
Quil keeps asking to come over think he likes you a little too much
Tell him 'm not into the cougar thing
What is it with you and age
mean, that Cullen guy was young, didn't seem to
bother you
He instantly regrets saying Edward's name as he sees it crush her spirits
Off Bella, retreating into herself
(
) Not even Jacob could keep away the nightmares
41
-  () Bella  through the forest, searching desperately
Then she turns -- finds Edward a few yards away, his face cold
She steps toward him -- but he  backward, suddenly twenty yards away -- (
) the terror, the loneliness
-- he rapidly retreats further until he disappears, leaving Bella utterly alone, darkness closing in on her
'  - Bella  in her sleep
The light turns on and Charlie hurries to her side, gently shaking her awake
You're alright, Bells
You're okay
Her eyes open, tears streaming down her cheeks
He doesn't quite know what to do, so hands her a glass of water from her bedside table
She sits up, sips
He pulls the dreamcatcher from her bedpost
This thing's not working very well
It's
not as bad as it was
Yeah right
(beat) know what it's like, you know
When your mom left me
had a hell of a time
Imagined doing all kinds of crazy things, just to stop the pain
She avoids his look
But hanging out with Jacob seems to help get your mind off
things
He's been keeping me afloat
That's good
He's a good guy
Off Bella
42
'  - Bella drives along the La Push cliffs
Jacob rides shotgun
He studies a grease-blackened motorcycle crankshaft
We got lucky at the dump
You know how much a new crankshaft goes for
Sure,  spend all my free time on crankshaft-dot-com
think that's a porn site
(then) These bikes are gonna be rolling soon
Where should we ride first
Someplace sunny
Like there's any place sunny around here
know a place above the cloud line -- The second she says it, she regrets it -- off her -- -  , Bella lying in the grass with Edward ("Twilight"), flowers surrounding them
(
) Where is it
- her face falls
Actually, it's
too hard to get to
He brings his easy smile and optimism to the rescue
So we'll find our sunny spot, right
She smiles, grateful
Then she looks out the window at the cliffs
and notices -- 43
'  - stand on the rocky ledge of the cliff (Sam, Jared, Paul, and a fourth)
They wear nothing but cut-off shorts
They push each other, rough-housing
Isn't that
Sam Uley
(bitter) And his cult
Suddenly, two of the guys throw a struggling Jared over the cliff
on the brakes
Jumps out of the truck -- Jacob climbs out after her -- Oh my God
Stop them
-- () - -- Bella runs toward them
But Jacob's laughter slows her
They're not really fighting, Bella
They're cliff diving
What, on purpose
Scary as hell, but a total rush
'  -   (Paul) takes a running start and himself into the air, twisting and cartwheeling down
Bella is intrigued, sees the potential for adrenaline - for Edward
Most of us jump from lower down
Think  could
Man, first motorcycles, now cliff diving
You said it was a rush
44
Maybe on a warmer day
And not from the top
We'll leave the showing off to Sam and his disciples
There's that bitter edge again
She looks at him
You don't like them
They think they run this place
Acting all bad ass, calling themselves "protectors
" What are they protecting
The tribe, the land, their right to be jerks
Embry used to call them hall monitors on steroids; now look at him
Bella looks closer,  the fourth guy is Embry, hair now shorn, thin frame filled out, laid back expression gone
It pains Jacob to see him
That's Embry
didn't recognize him
What happened to him
He missed some school - then, out of nowhere, he's following Sam around
Same thing happened with Paul and Jared
They weren't even friends, now Sam owns them
(beat) Sam keeps giving me this look, like he's waiting for me or something; it's kinda freaking me out
Maybe you should just avoid them
try but
She sees he's unnerved, instinctively hugs him reassuringly
Hey
If it gets worse, we'll go to my Dad
Or you can come stay with us
45
Thanks
(beat, holding her) If this is how you're going to react, 'll freak out more often
Bella realizes she crossed a line and covers, playfully shoving him
As they head to the truck, Bella looks back -- '  - -- but now he's looking directly at her
Then he turns and over the edge, cutting a clean line into the water
-  - Bella carries her tray to an empty table, but looks over at Mike, Angela, Jessica and Eric
Bella takes a breath, then casually joins them
They take note, but keep talking
'll kill Tyler if he gave me his flu
It's going around
My sister was so sick she couldn't come on our hike this weekend
so she didn't see it
(sotto) Ang, maybe you should keep that to yourself -- We saw something, Eric
believe you
No he doesn't
He's just trying to get lucky
(suddenly hopeful) Is that an option
(ignoring him) It was jet black and huge; on all fours it was still taller than a person
bear maybe
46
Or Big Foot
Or an alien
Lucky you didn't get probed
(quietly) We saw it
She's serious
And a little scared
Bella see that
You're not the only one
Everyone stares
Did Bella just speak
My dad's been getting reports at the sheriff's station
couple hikers went missing
People are scared
Now everyone's chilled
did hear some guy talking about it at the store
Last time you clowns doubt my girlfriend
As they continue, Angela mouths "thanks" to Bella
They share a smile and join in, Bella becoming part of the group
: ' -- just inches apart
You look scared
'm not
She's lying
to see she's straddling the now completed motorcycle
Jacob stands next to her, holding the bike up
There's an intimacy to their proximity
-- 47
-     () - The bike is aimed down a dirt road
Jacob runs through the instructions: Brake
(she taps it) Clutch
(she squeezes it) Right
Gas
(she grips it) You ready
Bella nods
Jacob grins
then - the bike
Slowly
release the clutch
She does
the bike moves forward an inch -- Jacob cautiously steps back
She moves forward another inch -- (
) Stop
Bella turns to find the apparition of  standing next to her
Her hand slips off the clutch, the bike  and falls on top of her
Jacob quickly lifts it off her as the apparition of Edward disappears
You okay
Bruises, breaks --
'm going again
'm not sure that's a good -- Bella quickly rises and hops back on
Guess we're going again
Now what are you going to do with the clutch
Release it
Slowly
Jacob nods
Then kick-starts the bike again
She releases the clutch and moves forward
Slowly at first -- reappears at her side, glowering
48
She keeps going, a little faster
appears on her left now; she passes him
He reappears ahead; she passes
'  as the wind flings her hair back
She gathers speed
and for a moment, experiences pure freedom, exhilaration
then she sees Edward standing at the curve in the road ahead, and realizes -- (yelling to Jacob) don't -- how do  turn
Bank it
Bank - hit the brake
Jacob races toward her
She reaches the turn, doesn't bank, goes straight
and flies right into a wall of trees
As she lies on the ground dazed, Jacob hurries up
What, are you training for the -games
She looks around for Edward
He's gone
want to go again
Forget it
'm revoking your motorcycle privileges
Man, look at your head
Indeed, blood drips down her forehead
He pulls off his shirt to mop it up
She shrinks away -- God, 'm sorry
You're apologizing for bleeding
It doesn't
bother you
It's just blood, Bella
He bends over her, carefully tending her head
She finds herself looking at him
His dark eyes, his bare chest and smooth skin
He glances at her
49
What are you staring at
Just, you're actually
good looking
He's surprised; there's a moment between them
He smiles
How hard did you hit your head
(realizing) Oh  - yeah
He offers her a hand, helps her up
She holds onto it, alarmed
Jake, you're hot
Upgraded from good looking
No, temperature hot
(feels his forehead) You're burning up
feel fine
He takes her hand from his forehead
Holds it
She tries to pull it away
What
can't hold your hand
It just
means something else to you than it does to me
One, that's my problem
But two
we have fun, you think 'm hot -- Good looking
know you like me
50
More than anyone
But
that's all
Because of Cullen
The name stings her
He takes both her hands now
Look,  know what he did to you can see it in your face every time his name comes up
But you need to know - would never, ever do that to you promise  will never hurt you
You can count on me
already do
You don't know how much
You're my best friend but don't think my feelings will change
He takes this in, it's hard
wave of something sweeps over him
He sits back
Closes his eyes, takes a breath
'm sorry
should've said something right from the start -- No
That's not --  just feel
weird
told you, you have a fever
Probably that flu everyone has
It doesn't
feel like flu
don't know what it is
Off Jacob, rattled, and Bella, concerned
'  -   - Bella does homework
Charlie watches a game
She's on edge
Anxious
-- (
) Hey Jake
Just checking to see how you're doing
And to say 'm sorry, about, you know
how  feel and
hope the flu passes fast
Call me
51
-   - Bella climbs out of her truck,  the empty spot where Edward used to park
Eric and Angela canoodling
Couples everywhere
She puts her head down, hurries to class
-- (
) Hi Jake
Your dad said you have mono
He won't let me visit but
would you call me
'  - Bella paces her room, not wanting to sleep/dream
She eyes the phone, waiting for it to ring
-- (
) Me again
just
need to hear your voice
'  -  - Bella's on the phone, leaving yet another message, her desperation having reached its peak
In the living room, Charlie and Harry check their fishing gear
Jacob
Please
Call me
She hangs up, leans her forehead against the phone
Charlie enters -- Harry and  will be back by three -- He stops when he sees her
Puts a hand on her shoulder
It's mono, Bells
He's too sick to even call
You just gotta wait it out
(then) You know,  don't have to go fishing
(forcing a smile) No, go
'll call Jess or someone
52
Good
But stay here or at Jess's
No hikes or anything
We're issuing a warning about those bears
Off Bella's nod -- - - Bella tries to navigate her way to the meadow
She refers to a map, a compass
(
) was more afraid of the hole in my chest than  was of bears
Without Jacob,  needed Edward more than ever
Bella tries a trail; it doesn't look familiar
Backtracks
Tries another
(
) needed to know he existed
There was only one place  might find him, or the feeling of him
-   - Edward and Bella lie in the grass surrounded by flowers, sunlight dappling them
They look lovingly into one another's eyes
- the memory and her desperation fuel her
Finally, she sees a clearing ahead, hurries toward it -- () - -- Bella steps into the clearing, hopeful
but her face falls
In contrast to the warmth of her memory, the meadow is cold, gloomy, cloudy
And no Edward
She closes her eyes, trying to force Edward here
Nothing
Her eyes open on the empty, overcast meadow
Bella sinks to her knees
Tears threatening
But then she hears a  noise
She turns toward it, peers into the woods
Another   comes from another part of the woods
She spins toward it -- nothing
Then she turns and when she finds -- Vampire  standing just ten yards away
Dreadlocks, chiseled face
Bella can't believe it
53
Laurent
Bella
She beams, realizing he's real
Laurent
must admit,  didn't expect to find you here
live here
But you -  thought you were in Alaska with Carlisle's friend
Tanya,  was
It was kind of him to arrange, given my association with James and Victoria, "The Enemy
" You tried to help us
Laurent begins to stroll in a slow arc around her, his eyes assessing her as -- went to visit the Cullens, but their house is empty
'm surprised they left you behind
Weren't you sort of a pet of theirs
Bella's smile falters, fear beginning to dawn on her
Um
something like that
Do the Cullens visit often
Suddenly, ' apparition appears between them
Lie
Absolutely
All the time
54
Lie better
'll tell them you stopped by
Edward fades (throughout, he'll reappear when he speaks, then fade again)
Bella tries to look relaxed
Will they be able to reach you in Alaska
don't think so
Tanya's "vegetarian" family was pleasant enough
But the dietary restrictions were difficult - living on nothing but animals
Suddenly, he's standing inches from her
She now sees his Dark blood-red
(conspiratorial) Tell me Bella
Do you ever feel compelled to
cheat
Bella involuntarily takes a step away from him
But that's not why  left
came back here as a favor to Victoria
You're still friends
(shrugs) More or less
She asked me to get the lay of the land with the Cullens
Because, well
'm afraid Victoria is quite put out with you
That's
too bad
Yes
She feels it's only fair to kill Edward's mate, given he killed hers
Eye for an eye, mate for a mate
And now Bella knows
Terror overwhelms her
Edward appears -- 55
Threaten him
Edward will know who did it
He'll come after both of you
don't think he will
After all, how much could you mean to him if he left you here unprotected
(then) Victoria sent me here for information
She won't be happy about my killing you
No, Laurent
(sincere) No, no, no
Don't be upset
'm doing you a kindness
Victoria plans on killing you slowly, painfully - whereas 'll make it very quick
(inhaling) And you smell so
mouth watering
He faces her, taking in her scent, bloodlust building
Her eyes dart around, escape is impossible -- The only thing she  is the apparition of Edward, looking at her with alarm
(whispering, barely audible) Edward
love you
Laurent is milliseconds from biting - then abruptly, his expression changes
He sees something in the forest behind Bella - and it terrifies him
don't believe it
He steps back
Bella's confused as she realizes he's no longer focused on her
she follows his eyes, slowly turning
to find behind her -- skulking out of the darkness of the woods
It stalks towards them, a low disturbing  in its throat, sharp teeth gleaming
56
Bella is trapped between the two killers
Edward whispers in her ear -- Don't
Move
The wolf slinks closer to Bella, a mere twenty feet from where she stands, then -- soundlessly emerge from the trees, flanking the black wolf
They're the size of small horses, all of different hues: dark silver, chocolate, ash and russet- brown
Their hackles are up, lips curling, bodies crouched, ready to spring
Bella is frozen with fear as they come toward her
The - is the closest and looks directly at her
Laurent continues to retreat - then suddenly, almost simultaneously -- -- Laurent  across the meadow -- -- The wolves  toward Bella -- and leap right over her in pursuit of Laurent
Their thunderous  and shake her as the pack sprint after the vampire, surrounding him before he reaches the treeline -- Laurent  at the dark silver wolf,  the wolf half-way across the meadow
Another wolf lunges at Laurent - he kicks it and it sails into a tree,  it
The two wolves recover, lurch back to the pack which closes in on Laurent
It's impossible to know who will prevail -- Bella doesn't stay to find out
She  into the woods -- () - -- Bella runs franticly, tearing down the hillside, tripping, quickly picking herself up -- running, running -- / - -- Bella  out of the treeline and to her truck parked on the shoulder
She jumps in,  out -- '  - Bella  in, out of breath
Charlie and Harry Clearwater are washing their fishing gear
Charlie spins
Bella
What's wrong
57
They're not giant bears --  saw them
Up in a meadow -- Damn it,  told you not to go into the woods
What did you see, Bella
Wolves
They're wolves, Dad
We might note, though they don't, that Harry Clearwater sighs ever-so-slightly
Five of them
The size of - of cars
swear
They went after -- something - - and  ran
Charlie grabs up the phone; as he dials -- Harry, can you get some men from the rez
Sure
Yeah
'll just -- Harry seems more concerned than gung-ho as he slips out
(into phone) Jerry
Put a hunting party together -- tranq guns, large caliber shotguns -- there's something dangerous out there
(
) Something dangerous
Victoria
Her eyes dart around the house, their vulnerability spinning in on her
As Charlie hangs up, goes to his gun cabinet -- (
) If she came after me, Charlie would try to protect me -- and he'd die
've gotta go to the station
Good
-- That's good
58
You okay here
You want to come with
Actually,  -- need to see a friend
'  - Bella knocks
Then knocks again
Finally, Billy answers
Hi, Billy
know Jacob's sick but -- He's out with friends
(taken aback) Oh
'll let him know you came by
Billy starts to close the door, but Bella stops him
Wait -- he's got mono, right
That's what you told my dad
(with compassion) You should go on home, Bella
And he closes the door
Off Bella -- '  - Bella climbs in, slams the door, pissed
Starts the truck
Then turns it off
Deciding, she tosses the keys aside and sinks down into her seat to wait
'  -
'  -    - now pours down
Billy, inside, pulls the curtain back, looks out at Bella with sympathy
Then closes the curtain
'  -   - Bella looks out the passenger window at Billy
Suddenly, there's a  at the driver's window
She spins to find -- standing there
But his face is shockingly different
His hair is cropped short
No friendly smile
59
No warmth in his eyes
Just a hard, brooding resentment
Bella is taken aback
She climbs out of the truck to  -- '  () - -- behind Jacob stand Sam Uley, Jared, Paul and Embry
They're oblivious to the rain, wear minimal clothes
You cut your hair
Go away
Jacob turns away
Sam leads the group toward the house
Jacob follows
She, and we, note his sure-footed strides; his awkward growth spurt disappeared overnight
She grabs his arm
What happened to you
He stops, turns back
The others wait on the porch for him
They're out of earshot, but won't leave him alone with her
(lowers her voice) can help
His face is hard as he shakes his head
He's not talking
Sam got to you
What did he do
Sam's trying to help me, don't blame him
Then who
(bitterness seething) How `bout those filthy, reeking bloodsuckers you love
The Cullens
(thrown) don't know what you're -- You know exactly what 'm talking about
He's shaking, almost convulsing with anger
She regroups
60
The Cullens are long gone
How are they to blame
They started all this by existing
Goddamn leeches -- Jacob
Jacob glances at Sam, who gives him a look
Jacob takes a breath, trying to calm himself
can't be friends with you anymore
Jake,  know  hurt you
should have been more up-front but -- needed you,  still do
don't know what that means yet, but if you give me time -- Stop
Don't
It's not you -- -- "It's not you, it's me
"     God
It's true
'm not
good
You're wrong -- It doesn't matter
This is over -- can't take losing my best friend, too
You already have -- Don't say that -- you promised -- Go home, Bella
Don't come back
He practically runs away, joining the gang who all disappear inside
Off Bella, standing in the rain
61
'  - Bella enters, dripping wet, too listless to close the door
Charlie's face falls when he sees the pain and lifelessness returned to her
He grabs a blanket, wraps her in it
Billy called, said you and Jacob had a fight
But, hey, you guys will work it out, 'm sure of it
'm
going to change
Bella heads upstairs
Charlie sags, helpless
He moves to the open door -- -
'  () - -- It paces, watching Charlie slowly close the door
: - Bella  through the forest again, searching
She turns -- finds Edward, cold, distant
But his face begins to
and becomes Jacob's
She reaches for him but he backward, suddenly many yards away
Why
He, too, retreats further, disappearing until Bella is alone
encroaches, the moonlight becoming a tiny spotlight on her
She searches the dark - then  a pair of , female, blood-red - coming toward her;  a loud -- '  - -- Bella tosses herself awake, slowly realizing it was just a dream
But she  the  noise again
Fingernails on her window
Bella bolts upright, looks around for a weapon -- (
) (whisper shouting) Bella
Ouch - damn it; open the window
Bella cautiously moves to her window to find -- 62
'  () - Jacob, shirtless, clings to the top of a tree which bends with his weight
Bella opens the window, whisper-yelling -- What the hell are you doing
Get out of the way
He begins to swing his legs, increasing momentum
She realizes what he's about to attempt -- No
He launches himself  the window with great agility -- '  () - -- Jacob lands on the balls of his feet
Bella is stunned
He freezes, listening for Charlie
Nothing
bitter, self- satisfied grin spreads on his face
It pisses Bella off
He takes in her room
pictured your room more
cluttered
Why are you here
had to talk to you
Alone
To kick me in the gut again
It was bad before, but you made it so much worse
know
And  want to explain
But
can't
Then leave
He stays put
She tries to push him but he's immoveable
You're done with me, remember
Get
Out
63
Bella,  literally can't explain
She becomes aware of her hands on his bare skin and muscular chest
The intimacy of their touch
She pulls away
broke my promise not to hurt you, know
But 'm trying to keep it now
need you to understand
even if you don't want to see me when you find out -- Find what out
He starts to speak -- but can't
It's agonizing
She sees he's in pain
Is concerned
What's wrong
can't do it
Yes, you can
'll help you
We can
we can leave
Leave home, leave Sam
It's not something  can run away from
(then) would run with you though
If could
(beat, realizing) Wait
Wait,  already --  told you
You know this -- you can guess
don't want to play games with you -- You have to
can't tell you, but if you remember - it was that day  ran into you at the beach
told you a story -- come on
told you a story
about
about
"The Cold Ones
" You said it was a stupid tribal myth
64
(pointedly) Was it
Are the Cold Ones a myth
She doesn't answer
What else did  say
That
the tribe made a treaty with them
They can't come onto your land and
don't know,  don't remember
Try, Bella
You have to give me more
Tell me where to look
Is there something should see --
No, that's too dangerous -- 'll take the risk
Jacob, show me
He looks at her, doesn't want to but knows it's the only way
Beat
Where was the last place you saw me
the way  used to be
The motorcycles - that clearing in the woods
He nods slowly, then turns to go
She stops him
Don't go
There are dangerous things out there; more than you know
He looks at her with a wry smile
Then pulls her into a hug
Her cheek against his bare chest
She takes in the closeness
then he soundlessly heads out her door
beat -- Bella starts pulling on clothes
'  - Bella drives through the darkness
65
(
) If  was going to lose someone else, needed to know why
She pulls off the road, and drives into the forest
-     - Bella parks
Climbs out of her truck
The moon eerily illuminates the clearing
Forest  encroach
She hears a  amid the trees
Spooked, she freezes -- then   emerge from the trees
moment as their eyes meet
Then -- Sam Uley, Paul, Embry and Jared step into the clearing, as well, half-clothed, movements almost synchronized
Their expressions simultaneously alter into fury when they see Bella
Paul spins on Jacob
What the hell have you done
didn't tell her
You'd know if did
She's here, isn't she
Bella, there's nothing to see here
You should go home
Not until  know what you did to Jacob
(advancing on Bella) What we did
Jacob moves in front of Bella protectively, facing Paul
Both of you, calm down -- Sam, she knows things about the bloodsuckers
She's been on the inside
She can help -- Like a leech lover's gonna help us
66
Watch what you call her
Get a grip, guys -- But Paul and Jacob are so angry, their bodies begin to shake, nearly convulse
It unnerves Bella -- It's alright, Jacob, 'll go -- Paul and Jacob are beyond hearing
All you care about is her -- (commanding) Paul, back off
-- and she doesn't give a crap about you -- Jacob flashes anger,  Paul, hard
Paul  backward
Jacob
Paul rises, outraged, throws his head back in a growl, vibrating violently -- Too late
Bella, get back
Paul   but halfway to the ground there's a loud noise and Paul explodes in silver-gray fur, becoming a massive wolf crouched and ready to spring
Bella, horrified, grabs Jacob's arm, pulling him -- Run, Jacob
-- But he yanks away from her, runs directly at the Paul-wolf -- Jake, no
Stop --
67
Jacob  headfirst into the air - with another sharp sound, shreds of cloth blast into the air, fur from Jacob's skin - he lands on the ground a gigantic russet-brown wolf, charging the Paul-wolf
Bella reels as the two wolves  into each other, snarling and  one another
The sound is
Their teeth flash at each other's throats
Bella stumbles backward as the fight carries the two wolves beyond the clearing and into the woods -- , as they fight deeper and deeper into the darkness
until they disappear
The horrible of the fight still  -- -- Sam starts after them, kicking off his shoes
Take Bella to Emily's place
Sam disappears leaving an eerie quiet
long silence
Guess the wolf's out of the bag
Off Bella, stunned
- '  - Bella's truck, driven by Embry, pulls up to a tiny, weathered house with a window box full of marigolds
Jared, in the back, jumps out, opens Bella's door
He and Embry head toward the house
She doesn't move
(to Jared) Pay up
She didn't puke
Jared, annoyed, hands Embry five bucks
Told you she was tough
She does run with bloodsuckers
Wait
We should go back, make sure Jacob's okay
hope Paul gets some teeth in him
Serve him right
68
No way
Jake's a natural
You see him phase on the fly
gotta fiver says Paul doesn't touch him
Easy money
Paul's been at it longer
Bella looks at them, appalled
They realize she's not following them
Come on in
We won't bite
Speak for yourself
Bella warily climbs out of the car, joins them
Embry pauses at the door -- Oh, hey, about Emily - Sam's fiance - just try not to stare
It bugs Sam
Why would  stare
-- -- But the guys are already entering -- '  () - Bella hesitantly enters behind Jared and Embry
She sees , 20, at a counter, popping fresh muffins out of a tin
only one side of Emily's beautiful face, draped by long black hair
You guys hungry
Like  have to ask
Emily looks toward them now --  the other side of her face:  scar runs from hairline to chin, three red lines that pull down her eye and twist her mouth
Who's this
As Jared and Embry beeline for the muffins -- Bella Swan
Who else
So you're the vampire girl
69
And you're a
you're all
Werewolves
'm just engaged to one
But these animals -- (slaps Embry's hand) Save some for your brothers
Bella cautiously approaches the counter, keeping an eye on the door for Jacob
Leave it to Jacob to get around Sam's gag order
He didn't say anything, or
couldn't
That's a wolf thing
Alpha's orders get obeyed whether we want to or not -- How `bout you shut up now, Embry
You know Jacob's gonna fill her in
Yeah,  know every stupid thought he has
(to Bella) Wanna know what he thinks of you
Like you need special powers to know that
(to Bella) It's another wolf thing
We hear each other's thoughts
Good for hunting
Embarrassing for everything else
Jared leans to Bella, challenging
Freaking out yet
70
(meets his look) You're not the first -- mind reader 've met
(grins) Jake's right
You are good with the weird
But  don't get -- how
Why
-- (
) -- Because there are bad things here
She spins - Sam is now standing behind her, the front door open behind him
And they're getting worse
Bella is chilled
Sam moves past her to Emily - the sight of her instantly warms his face
Hey, Em
He kisses Emily's scarred face adoringly
Bella has to look away
Their utter devotion is a painful reminder of what she has lost
Fortunately, she's distracted by -- Jacob and Paul's arrival
They laugh and jab one another
Bella is relieved to find Jacob unscathed
Jared and Embry crowd them, finding a scar on Paul's arm -- Ha
Pay up
As Jared reluctantly hands Embry five bucks, Jacob's eyes find Bella's
He nods solemnly to the door; we should talk
-  - The sun is just beginning to rise, reddening the clouds overhead
Bella paces by the cliff's edge, trying to come to grips with this new reality
Jacob keeps his distance, trying to control his anger
You just have to
stop
71
It's not a life-style choice
It's in my
Killing is in your
Man,  thought maybe you wouldn't be such a hypocrite -- what, 'm not the right kind of monster for you
Can't measure up to your bloodsucking friends -- (angry as well) Hey, they manage to survive without hurting innocent people
Jacob stops -- a beat as his anger is replaced by confusion
Wait - innocent
-- so
you don't care that  morph into a giant dog
Just that
kill people
(appalled) "Just
" Those hikers' lives mean that little to you
He bursts out laughing
(repelled, turns to go) Oh my God
Bella -- Bella wait
(he stops her) We're not killing hikers
We're trying to protect them
From what
The only thing we do kill: Vampires
(stunned, reels) Vampires
Jake, no -- 72
(steps back, bitter) Don't worry, we can't touch your precious Cullens - unless they bite someone and violate the Treaty -- That's not what  -- you can't fight vampires
They're too dangerous
Please
We took out that leech with the dreads easy enough
You
killed Laurent
(worried) He didn't seem like a friend
No, God no
But
how
It's what we do, why we exist
few "lucky guys" in the tribe have the gene
If a bloodsucker moves to town, our  kicks in, we reach the right age and the fever hits -- (realizing) "Mono
" wish
Next thing  know, they're telling me, this is your life now
That future you saw for yourself
Gone
Desolation fills him
She sees this
It's bad, huh
just hate feeling
out of control
Like maybe Sam is right; you shouldn't be around me
Like you could get rid of me
73
You've seen Emily
That lands with her
She nods
Sam lost it for a split second; Em was standing too close -- he's still messed up about it
(beat) don't want to be that kind of nightmare
You're not like that
You save people, right
You saved me from Laurent
Yeah, didn't mind taking him out
His red-headed girlfriend will be fun, too
Bella stops, chilled to the bone
Victoria
She's here
We chased her all the way to the border the other night
But she won't stay gone
Keeps coming back -- if we knew what she was after
(sees Bella's face) What
know what she wants
Me
: - with Canadian plates blasts down the highway at a blinding speed -- - , easily controlling the steering wheel with two fingers
She speaks to someone we don't see, her words laced with longing and fury
74
James hated cars
He liked being close to the ground
But 'd steal one occasionally, to throw him off the scent
See, we played hide and seek sometimes
No one can hide like me -- (grins to her passenger) -- but no one could seek like James
her barely conscious passenger, , 30's, a pretty bleach-blonde with expensive jewelry
She's just coming to, a bump on her head where she was knocked out
What -- what are you --
Some games   lasted months
but we always got   hungry for each other
(sly,   to Denise) So 'd let   him find me
Denise now lucid, looks around to  -- her husband, ' , well-dressed in a turtle neck, 40's, sits upright, his head tilted forward as if he's resting
Denise reaches for him -- Michael
Oh my God -- We never could get enough of each other
(seething) We would have had forever to try
Denise, scared, shakes Michael's arm -- Michael
-- which causes Michael's head to roll to the side, revealing his gouged, blood-soaked neck and his vacant, dead eyes
Denise starts
Victoria grins
James always loved a screamer
Victoria's hand jets out, grabbing a fistful of Denise's hair
She yanks Denise over, exposing her neck just as we -- : 75
'  - -- Excellent
If the redhead's after Bella, we've got bait
With stunning speed, Jacob grabs a four-pronged spading fork from some garden tools, and  it toward Jared's head - Jared easily, and amazingly, catches it
She is not bait
-  picnic table in the middle of this small, quaintly landscaped garden
Jacob, Bella, Embry, Paul, Sam, Jared and Emily are in the midst of a huge breakfast
should leave town
Victoria will follow you and make it harder for us to catch her
No one can catch her
She can escape anything
Ooh
She has special powers
Some of them do
They all look at her
She instantly regrets saying it
Like
what
Bella
The mind reader you said you knew
He was a suckhead
Can they all do that
That would blow
No,  -- shouldn't have - no
She's still protecting them
76
don't know why
It's not like they stuck around to protect you -- Guys, back off
Jacob looks apologetically at Bella
She shrinks, stung
'  - Jacob walks her to the door
Don't worry, we've got this place covered
She won't get near you or Charlie
Bella nods
He sees she's blue
Hey, we should do something fun
Like
cliff diving, right
could use the rush
Soon
After we catch her
He offers a reassuring look before jogging into the woods
- Bella tentatively approaches the large, modern glass home
She climbs the porch steps, approaches the door
-   () - Bella enters to find it perfectly intact, lived-in, warm, candles glowing
and the Cullen family enjoying the evening - Carlisle, Esme, Rosalie, Emmett and Jasper
Bella is overwhelmed with joy at seeing them
You're here
But they ignore her
Won't even look at her
She starts toward them but suddenly -- Edward appears and  Bella away, pulling her to the door and pushing her out, slamming it on her -- 77
- () - -- Bella runs to the window, peers in at the family who continue to ignore her as they gather around Edward -- '  - Bella awakens, tears on her face
She can't take it
Gets the hell out of bed, anxious to leave the dream behind
But it stays with her
'  - Bella knocks on the door, rain falling around her, wind blowing strong
Emily opens the door
Sees her
Bella
Are you okay
Yeah,  just
is Jacob here
He wasn't at home
Sam appears behind Emily
He's with Jared and Embry, keeping an eye on things
'm heading out soon
Should  tell him something
-- as Sam wraps an arm around Emily
Their deep love is achingly obvious
Off Bella's face -- to Bella and Edward at her birthday party, in a similar embrace, as Alice  their picture -- - pained
You want to come in
-- But Bella's already hurrying to her truck, determination on her face
- as it locks and loads
, who checks it, then notes the position of the   in his hunting party, all wearing rain gear
He  Harry at the end of the line, pausing, looking down
You got something, Harry
78
- he looks down at a large
Nope, nothin'
The hunting party moves forward
Harry lets them get ahead, stomps out the paw print
as he passes under a huge tree -- to find that  , crouching on a limb, is
She watches Charlie with a vengeful glare
She noiselessly  down to a lower branch, getting ready to pounce on Charlie -- - his eye catches her movement; he looks up, the back of her red head -- his breath  -- She  the sound, even through the rain and wind
Before Harry can raise his shotgun -- Victoria's standing next to him,  the gun out of his hands with superhuman speed
He , breath stuck in his chest
She grins, about to bite -- but suddenly -- - - smashes into her, knocking her away
She rights herself immediately and takes off -- give chase, disappearing
It all happened soundlessly, in seconds, unbeknownst to the others
- he still can't catch his breath, he clasps his left arm --   -- - of   - the wolves are right on Victoria's tail, blasting through the forest -- -   - He turns to  Harry clutching his chest
Charlie runs to Harry's side -- escaping at breakneck speed she bursts out of the trees to -- () - -- Victoria beelines for the choppy water, dives in -- when she reappears, she's hundreds of yards offshore -- prowl the beach in frustration as we go -- 79
-   - he falls to his knees just as Charlie reaches him
Off Charlie beginning
: -  - Bella's truck comes to a stop; she climbs out
Ignoring the wind and rain, she strides to the cliff's edge; looks down -- '  -   - steely gray
Rough whitecaps
(
) Step back
Bella smiles, tears of relief springing to her eyes
She turns to find Edward's apparition at her side
She steps back from the cliff's edge - which causes him to disappear
That's it
She starts pulling off her shoes and coat, adrenaline pumping -- Edward's apparition reappears, but she keeps going -- Stop this now, Bella
You won't stay with me any other way
She takes a last look at him
then with a running leap -- herself over the edge -- with exhilaration as she plummets down, down
then  into the water
'  () - No sign of Bella
beat
Suddenly, she  back up
Inhales deeply -- and laughs
Yes
She enjoys a moment of elation and empowerment
then turns to swim ashore
but her smile falters when she realizes how strong the current is
crashes over her head
She gasps for breath
Then hits her
Starts to pull her under
80
- Bella struggles -- - she pops up, looks around in a panic,  -- '  -    - something orange-ish, bobbing on the surface of the water -- Bella goes down - then comes up again -  - thing is suddenly thirty yards closer
Bella struggles to stay afloat but the current  her into a rock, the air goes out of her chest
She sinks
-  -- ' , floating effortlessly, hungry anticipation on her face
She dips below the surface, vanishing
-  , struggling at first
Edward appears in front of her, his eyes full of longing and love
He reaches to her, she to him, hands almost touching, things going dark
suddenly      -- : - - barely conscious
Breathe, Bella
'mon
Jacob hits her on the back
She spits up water, coming to
Bella
Can you hear me
Jake
She focuses, finally  Jacob hovering over her, relieved
Behind him stands Sam
She'll be alright
Sam looks out at the water, scanning it
Sensing something
What the hell were you thinking
needed
to see
something
81
What
The pearly gates
If we hadn't heard you scream -- Get her home
'm heading to the hospital
'll meet you there
Jacob nods
Sam jogs off
Why would you jump
Didn't you notice it's like a hurricane out here
know
It was stupid -- (realizing) -- Sam said hospital - someone's hurt
Harry Clearwater had a heart attack
Oh my God - does my Dad know
He and my dad are both over there
Will Harry be okay
don't know
Come on
'll find you something dry and drive you home
As Jacob helps Bella up, we   out to -- - where Victoria bobs, watching Jacob guide Bella away
then she disappears below the surface
'  - Jacob drives
Bella wears a fleece jacket but still shivers
He pulls her close, wrapping an arm around her -- Hundred and eight degrees over here
She tucks herself into him
Must be nice, never getting cold
82
It's a wolf thing
It's a Jacob thing
You're just
warm
(grins) Like the sun
(meaning it) Like the sun
Which always comes back
You can count on me
She nods
Awkward silence
He fills it
There are other cool things about all this, like --  heal fast
Wanna see me stab my hand
(no
) Yeah, `cause that would be fun
' /
() - The truck pulls up to the curb
It's pitch black outside
Jacob's still holding her close as he shuts the engine off
So
this wolf thing's not all bad
It's better
Now that you know
But
but
It just
comes so easily to me
More than the other guys
That's a good thing, isn't it
83
Maybe
Or maybe it makes me less
human than the others
(beat, quieter) Sometimes 'm scared  might
disappear, you know
Who  really am
Bella faces him, looks directly in his eyes
won't let that happen
Their faces are close
and stay close for an intimate beat
They could kiss, their lips near
but Bella blinks herself back to reality and pulls away
Thanks for driving - for everything
-- as she pushes open her door
wafts in -- Jacob reacts to a repugnant smell outside -- Holy crap --
He abruptly pulls Bella back into the truck,  her door shut and starts the truck
There's a bloodsucker out there
How do you know
can smell the stink
'm getting you out of here
As Jacob whips the truck around, the   -- '  -   -- a black Mercedes is parked in front
Bella spins to the rear window as Jacob floors it -- Stop
It's not Victoria -- Forget it -- It's Carlisle's car
They're here
Go back
-- 84
It's a trick -- He's still flooring it -- Bella cracks her door open while they're moving - he  on the brakes
She jumps out -- Damn it, Bella -- () - Bella hurries up the road toward her house
Jacob's suddenly standing in front of her, furious -- Stop
You gotta come with me
It's okay
They're my friends -- Don't you get it
If a Cullen is back here, this is their territory
The Treaty says we can only defend our own lands
-- It's not a war -- It is
And you'll only be safe in La Push
can't protect you here anymore
don't need you to -- -- You're about to cross a line -- Only if you draw one
She starts to move past him, but he stops her -- 'm not letting you do this
You don't have a choice
don't belong to you
Her words are a knife to the heart
She sees that, but can't take them back
He hands her the keys
85
Bye, Bella,  hope you don't die
She flinches at the stinging remark
He disappears into the darkness, leaving her alone on the dark road
She's closer to her house than her truck
She hurries forward
The   start to encroach, branches crackling, bushes rustling
She glances behind her
nothing but darkness
she faces forward again --- And runs directly into a
Bella  -- then realizes '
Bella is stunned
So is Alice
Alice
You're
alive
She's clearly confused, but Bella hugs her with tears of joy
Oh my God, Alice
You're here
heard voices -  didn't think it was you but - you're alive
You keep saying that
saw you - a vision of you - you jumped off a cliff
knew 'd be too late but -- (becoming angry) Why the hell would you try to kill yourself
didn't
was cliff diving
Why
Um
fun
That was fun for you
86
Until  hit the water
have never met anyone more prone to life-threatening idiocy
and what is that hideous wet dog smell
Oh
Probably Jacob
He's kind of a werewolf
Off Alice's horrified expression
'  -  - As Bella makes herself hot chocolate, Alice paces
Werewolves are not vicious
Until they lose their tempers
They saved me from Laurent, they're protecting me from Victoria -- (shocked) Victoria
didn't see her
didn't see you get pulled from the water either
It was Jacob who saved me
More than once
couldn't have made it without him
You have no idea what it was like
(softening) Yes
do
knew leaving wouldn't be good for you
tried to tell Edward, but he wouldn't listen
(hesitantly) Does he know you're here
No
He's been
away
87
-    - dump, empty but for a table and chair
On the table lie that once lined Bella's walls
Edward stands in the center of the room, stock still, staring out at the rising sun
His face is as empty and desolate as Bella's was after he left
on the table  jarringly
He doesn't move
It continues
Finally, he whips the receiver to his ear, exasperated
What
(
) Wow, Edward finally answered the phone
feel so honored
: '   - Rosalie, on the phone, stands at the picture window -- '  -
- Emmett, Jasper, Carlisle and Esme walk away from the house, over the snow to the treeline, on their way to hunt
None wear coats
'm hanging up now
Rosalie turns away from the window
Wait
You should come home
(no response) Esme's a wreck, Carlisle never smiles
Even Emmett's depressed
You've really done a number on them
(pained) 'm sorry
am
But they wouldn't be happier with me around
Trust me
just miss
us
The family
know
But the further away  am, the safer Bella will be
She deserves a shot at a normal life -- 88
But see, you don't have to worry about that, not anymore -- She stops realizing she may be making a mistake
But Edward caught it, sits up
Why, Rose
Did something happen
- uh -- Tell me, Rosalie
(rises, fierce) Tell me
-- (blurts) -- Alice had a vision
She saw Bella - - throw herself off a cliff
She's dead, Edward
Edward reels, uncomprehending
don't believe it
Alice is there now
Thought she could help with the funeral or something
as -- Come home, Edward
It's time
Edward
She's been disconnected
Off Rosalie, worried
'  - Bella walks Charlie to his cruiser
He wears a dark, ill- fitting funeral suit
At the car, Bella adjusts his tie -- Thanks for understanding, Bells
They wanted to keep the service small
Don't worry about me
Are you gonna be okay
89
Yeah
but Sue, and those kids -- Leah's only a year older than you
And Seth's, what, fourteen
Emotion threatens
She hugs him
He holds on a little too tightly for a beat
Then he bucks up, climbs into his car
There'll be a reception after might stay late, see if  can help
Bella nods, then waves as he drives away
She turns to head back inside but finds Alice suddenly at her side
She jumps
You're not going
'm not the most popular person on the werewolf rez right now
(saddened) Because you're friends with me
Bella shrugs
Alice hears something, then looks down the road -- '  appears in the distance
Huh
Didn't see them coming
Didn't see him pull you out of the water - maybe my visions are allergic to dogs
-- Alice
(jogging off) 'll go do some hunting
-- as it pulls up
Jacob drives, Embry in the passenger seat
Bella approaches, surprised to find in the back; same short hair and hard look as the others
Quil
you, too
(aggressive) Yeah
Me, too
Jacob climbs out
Embry takes the driver's seat
90
You alone
Yes
Shouldn't you be at the funeral
Had to talk to you first
(to the guys) 'll meet you there
Go on
They're wary
but pull out
Jacob follows Bella into -- '  -   - Jacob enters behind Bella
She turns to him
Look, Jake, 'm sorry  -- This place stinks to hell
She sees he's shut down, cold
She shuts down, as well
You're welcome to leave
In fact -- -- How many Cullens are here and how long are they staying
(snapping back) Just Alice
And she'll stay as long as she wants
Are the rest coming back
Not that 'm aware of
Anything else
That's it
Better go report to Sam
Jacob turns, starts to leave
He looks back, sees her anger turn to hurt
He stops
Beat
91
've done it again
keep breaking my promise not to hurt you
It doesn't have to be this way
He moves back to her, looks into her eyes with sadness
Yeah, it does
Am  gonna lose you this time, Jacob
He can't answer that, but he presses his hand to her cheek
It was easier when we were both human, wasn't it
They look at one another, Jacob's hand still on her face, his eyes searching hers
Slowly, he starts to bend toward her lips
She doesn't pull away
She misses him too much, needs him too badly
This time, she'll let it happen
kiss is a centimeter away
Suddenly, the shrill  of the phone makes them both jump
Jacob, the closest to it, doesn't move his face, just keeps looking into her eyes as he reaches for the phone, answers -- Swan residence
She smiles
But he instantly bristles, voice going cold
He's not here
He's at a funeral
Then the phone goes dead -- -    - -- Edward stares at his phone crazed, enraged, grief- stricken -- he  it against the wall, shattering it
'  -   - -- Jacob hangs up the phone
Filthy bloodsucker
92
Wait, who was it
(spitting it out) Dr
Carlisle Cullen
You should have let me talk to him
He didn't ask for you -- Suddenly, Jacob's eyes go wild, his body stiffens, starts trembling in the way that precedes a wolf-morph
Step away from me, Bella
Bella turns to see what he's reacting to - Alice
She stands in doorway looking empty, despairing
Bella immediately hurries to her side
Alice, what's wrong
Edward
What about him
What happened
just saw him in a vision
He
thinks you're dead
(realizing) That was him calling, not Carlisle
Bella, he's going to Italy
to the Volturi
'  --  of the  , the - the  of the rogue vampire -- : '  - The door  open and Bella races in, shoving clothes into a bag
Jacob dogs her, protesting
93
Why do you have to go
He won't believe Alice
He has to see that 'm alive
(stops her) He left you, Bella
He didn't want you anymore, remember
But  still love him, and 'm not gonna let him kill himself out of guilt
This wounds him
But she can't stop to soothe him
She pulls away and continues packing
What about your dad
'm eighteen, legally free to go
'll leave a note
Alice enters
Got the airline tickets
(squaring off with Alice) You Cullens might hunt animals but those monsters in Italy don't
'm well aware what the Volturi are
Then why are you taking Bella to them like a bottle of wine to a party
Right, she's better off here with Victoria stalking her
The one you dogs can't seem to catch
Jacob growls, a shudder ripping through him
Bella intercedes, stopping him from morphing by grabbing Alice
Let's go
94
'  - Alice flies to her car
But Jacob catches Bella's arm, not hostile
Just pleading
Please, Bella
Stay here
For Charlie
for me
Bella sees the love in his eyes; this could be last time she ever sees him
She hugs him, then pulls away
Bye, Jacob
He watches, agonized as she races to the car, climbs in
() - Bella tries to pull on her seat belt but Alice stops her -- Maybe Jacob's right
(Bella tries to interrupt) No
You need to realize - the Volturi could easily see me as Edward's accomplice
And you're a human who knows too much and tastes too good
They could kill us all
Bella's response is to yank her seat belt into its clip
Alice sees she won't change her mind
She shifts into gear and
Bella looks out the window for Jacob; he's not there
she turns toward the woods -- '  --   --    in the air as we  the      disappear into the forest
Off Bella, fighting tears but determined as hell
- walking down a seemingly endless corridor
Finally, he reaches a set of intricately carved double doors which open for him
He enters -- () - -- Edward finds himself facing three wooden thrones, on which sit the ancient Volturi: Aro, Marcus, Caius
Aro wears an expensive, contemporary, black Italian suit, long black hair in a loose ponytail to his waist
95
Marcus and Caius eschew modern clothing for rich silk robes, their long hair loose around them
All three have translucent, onion-like, white skin
Have you decided
It was an intriguing debate
We don't get many suicidal vampires
Pathetic
'm afraid your gifts are too valuable to destroy
But if you're unhappy with your lot, join us
We'd be delighted to utilize your skills
So you won't end this
Not without cause
Edward registers this, his face setting
Clearly, he's going to give them cause
He strides out
Off Aro
Such a waste
,  - Bella waits impatiently at the curb as -- -  with darkly tinted windows to a halt in front of her
The passenger door opens - Alice is behind the wheel, pulling off the chic, white, hooded coat she used for protection against the sun
As Bella climbs in, buckles up -- Where'd you get the car
Hope you're not opposed to grand theft auto
Not today
Alice  it and the Porsche   -- 96
- -    screams down a highway, cutting lanes, weaving through Peugots and Fiats -- - Bella grips the dashboard as Alice narrowly misses a car
How much time do we have
(
) He's waiting till noon, when the sun's at its highest
: -    -  (' ) It's jumpy, uneven --  stands in shadow, his shirt open, eyes shut
clock  as he steps into  -- He's going to make the Volturi change their minds
- (checking her watch) It's almost noon now
There's Volterra
Alice punches it as Bella  -- '  -     atop a distant hill
Volterra
- The narrow, centuries-old streets are crowded with festival revellers who all wear
They gaily head toward the town square carrying red pendants, balloons, scarves
The weaves through them, hurrying forward
-- Why are they all wearing red
97
San Marcos Day festival
The perfect setting
Large crowds
The Volturi won't let him get far enough to reveal himself - he's counting on that
We only have five minutes -- Alice screeches to a halt at a
Italian wave her back
Bella jumps out -- Where's the square
Follow that lane -- -- Bella's already running -- He'll be under the clock tower
Alice watches her go
then senses something, looks up -- '  -    - leaps from building to building, tracking Bella
As he disappears, off Alice -- -     - Bella races down the cobble-stoned alleys, stumbling on the uneven stones
Festival revellers head in the same direction, she maneuvers around them
-  flashes of the     -- As Bella nears the square, the alleys become more populated
She pushes past people   "excuse me," "sorry
" Finally, she emerges into -- () - '  - a sea of scarlet flags, dresses and jackets
On the other side of the crowded square -   ; it reads one minute before noon
Bella battles her way through the square; the crowd shoves back, shouting at her in Italian -- Fare attenzione
98
Bella charges forward to find herself blocked by -- - Suddenly,
The clock tower bells chime
It's noon
Bella jumps into the fountain, wades through the shallow water to the other side -- she jumps out and barrels through the crowd
Finally, she  -- '  - Edward, in the shadows, just inches from the sunlight
Edward
-- --
Bella's cry is drowned out by the
She pushes toward him, fighting to reach him as -- (  ) - as he unbuttons his shirt, exposing his bare chest -- (  ) - calling his name -- '  - he closes his eyes, welcoming death -- then slowly -- Edward takes a step into the sunlight, the rays hitting his shoe, but before the sun touches his skin -- into him - it's like running into a brick wall -- No, Edward
Don't
Edward opens his eyes and looks at Bella as the clock booms its final
He's amazed, already dead in his mind
Carlisle was right
heaven
No, 'm here
'm alive
(confused) You're
not real
Look at me
Alice was wrong
He begins to realize
she is real
99
Bella
Please, step back
'm alive, 'm -- He suddenly kisses her, stepping back into the shade with her
They soak each other in like starved people suddenly nourished
He pulls away to look at her
You're here
'm here
They share a long look, he's about to kiss her again
when suddenly, he stiffens -- and abruptly  Bella behind him, taking a protective stance in front of her -- They face the   that runs under the clock tower
Out of the alley's shadows emerge -- Both stunningly handsome males in their 20's: , huge, strong; and , slender, elegant
Both have unsettling burgundy red
won't be needing your services after all, gentlemen
Aro wants to speak with you again
No rules were broken
Demetri's smile suggests he doesn't agree
He's the more gracious of the two
But no less dangerous
We should take this conversation to a more appropriate venue
Fine
Bella, why don't you stay and enjoy the festival
The girl comes with us
That's not going to happen -- 100
suddenly appears, lightly tripping through the alley toward them, pulling back the hood of her white swing coat
Come on, guys, it's a festival
She reaches Edward and Bella, positioning herself in a protective stance, as well
We wouldn't want to make a scene
There won't be any scene
And we'll still win
But not easily -- (
) Enough
very tiny, young woman appears,
She also wears a dark overcoat, her Botticelli angel-like face peering out from under the hood
her
Felix and Demetri are back off immediately
Edward and Alice step back, as well
Bella can see they're afraid of this small girl
(nodding to her) Jane
(sotto to Alice) Who is she
(sotto to Bella) Just do as she says
Jane tosses Edward an overcoat
He dons it
Follow me
Jane simply turns and heads up the alley, confident they'll follow
Felix, smirking, gestures for them to go ahead of him
Edward takes Bella's hand
101
- Jane leads Edward, Bella and Alice through several narrow, dark alleys
Felix and Demetri bring up the rear
Edward never loosens his grip on Bella's hand
Their path dead ends at a
Jane just strides forward and, without breaking pace - drops down into an in the street; it's a drain
Alice follows Jane
Bella looks down, sees nothing but
It's alright
Alice will catch you
Edward takes her wrists, dangles her over the hole -- () - --   as she drops through the darkness, to be caught by Alice
Edward lands beside them, then Felix and Demetri
Edward pulls Bella close as they follow Jane through the sewer
He meets Bella's eyes, trying to look reassuring, but he's tense as hell
Finally, they reach -- Jane easily pulls it aside
They all enter
As the door  shut on them -- : They all exit into -- -  () - An elegantly decorated space with old world charm
They're greeted politely by  an attractive (human) receptionist
Buon pomeriggio
They head through the lobby to -- that Edward traversed earlier
Finally, they reach the carved double doors which open -- () - Bella, Edward and Alice enter to face the three ancients: Aro, Marcus, Caius
Eight   (including Jane, Felix, Demetri) line the walls in a variety of modern dark overcoats
102
'  -   - there's a depression in the center that leads to a drain
Bella shivers
Aro rises, greets them like old friends, taking Edward's hand and shaking it -- What a happy surprise
Bella is alive after all
Isn't that wonderful
Caius responds with a sour expression
Marcus could care less
Aro doesn't release Edward's hand, looks at him as -- Her blood appeals to you so much it makes me thirsty
How can you stand to be so close to her
It's not without effort
(laughing) can see that
Off Bella's look, Edward explains -- One touch and Aro can see every thought 've ever had in my life
You're quite the telepath yourself, Edward
Though
you can't read Bella's thoughts
Fascinating
He releases Edward's hand and turns to Bella
would love to see if you are an exception to my gifts, as well
He reaches for Bella's hand
She hesitates, does she have a choice
Aro laughs at her reluctance, further extends his hand
Bella finally takes it
beat as he holds her hand
confusion sweeping over him
Interesting
He releases her, moves back to his chair, deep in thought
103
wonder if -- (reading Aro's thoughts) No
Let's see if she's immune to all our powers, shall we Jane
Jane turns toward Bella but Edward springs in front of her -- Jane instead focuses her gaze on Edward which  him across the room where he collapses, writhing in agony
Jane concentrates on him with a small smile, enjoying his pain
Stop
Bella and Alice rush to his side
As soon as Jane looks away, Edward's pain ceases
Jane, dear
The girl
Jane's gaze now turns toward Bella who cringes, awaiting the pain
but nothing happens
Jane's grin is replaced by anger
Aro laughs like a child with a new toy
Jane, infuriated, moves toward Bella, but Aro stops her with a tiny gesture
Remarkable
She confounds us all
So what do we do with you now
(seemingly bored) You already know what you'll do, Aro
She knows too much; she's a liability
That's true
Unless Edward intends to give her immortality
(looks at Edward) But that's not your intention, is it
Shame
He nods to Felix who moves toward Bella, but he only takes a step before Edward tackles him
104
Edward, don't
Alice leaps to help but several Volturi guard hold her back, which is no easy job
As she struggles mightily -- Edward is David to Felix's Goliath
Edward will lose, but he'll go down fighting
-- Edward is fast, anticipating Felix's moves before he makes them, but Felix is stronger -- -- Felix grabs Edward, throws him into the ceiling, against the marble; he drops like a stone
Is then immediately  across the room
(to Aro) Stop this
Please
But Aro ignores her, leans forward to study Edward
Jane is itching to step in
Aro gestures her back
-- Felix takes some hits, but then lifts Edward overhead, him like a nut, then flinging him against a wall -- Bella runs toward Aro but a Volturi Guard flings her away; she flies  against the wall
The guard is then occupied by the thrashing Alice -- Bella, bruised, but not broken, makes another attempt to get to Aro -- finally reaches him, kneels in front of him -- Do it
Kill me
Just leave them alone
-- as she yanks her collar back, exposing her neck to him
Aro is surprised and intrigued
beat
Enough
Felix immediately releases Edward who manages to look up
He sees Bella kneeling in front of Aro
Get away from her --
Edward moves toward Aro but is quickly immediately pinned by Jane's invisible powers; he writhes in agony
Alice can no longer bear Edward's suffering -- 105
Edward, stop
've already seen it
(through gritted teeth) Alice, stay out of it
know what to do
Aro, intrigued, gestures for Jane to stop; Edward goes limp
Ah yes, the clairvoyant
saw your gift in Edward's thoughts
What is it you've seen
don't
'm the one who will change Bella
Bella is taken aback by this
Aro is surprised, as well
(beat, then gestures) Please
Be my guest
Not here
Her father is in law enforcement
If she goes missing, there will be questions
He is easily dealt with
It will happen, Aro
See for yourself
She thrusts out her hand
Aro nods to the Guards who release her
She gives him her hand
He closes his eyes -- : -  (' ) Edward hunts a deer
Matching his pace is another vampire - Bella
She's pale and beautiful - she and Edward smile at each other as they take a last grand leap for the kill -- : 106
- , utterly delighted
He releases Alice's hand
Mesmerizing
To see the things you've seen, that haven't happened yet
Alice moves to Edward's side, helps him up
'm so sorry
(to Bella) Your gifts will make for an intriguing immortal
Go make your preparations
Bella hurries to Edward's side, too
Caius is put out
You're letting them leave
Dear Caius, the girl's disappearance will be conspicuous at best
And surely you see her potential
(dispassionately) Let us be done with this
Heidi will arrive any moment
Aro gestures - Demetri throws open the carved double doors
Caius glares at them threateningly
We will make sure she follows through
would not delay
We do not offer second chances
Edward, recovered now, takes Bella by the arm and, with Alice, they cautiously back toward the door -- -   () - -- Demetri leads Bella, Edward and Alice out of the hall
As they make their way up the corridor, they see coming toward them -- , led by a beautiful vampire, Edward, Alice and Bella stop to let them all pass
As Heidi passes Demetri, he gives her a flirtatious smile -- 107
(sotto) Nice fishing, Heidi, save some for me
Heidi smiles
She gives Bella a curious once-over, then continues on
(to the group) This way, please
Stay together
and , 60's, cameras around their necks, pass Bella
The Husband winks at Bella -- Unusual tour, isn't it
Bill, get a picture of that bust there
As the Tourists file past, we  a variety of languages, German, Japanese, English
The group is moved toward the carved double doors which swing open for them
They file into the marble hall -- Edward pulls Bella forward, but she cranes her neck back as the last of the tourists disappear inside
As the large doors close
we begin to   -- Edward and Alice rush Bella out -    ' as the  gets louder
and louder -- : '  - '   as the   -- Bella sits bolt upright, yelling -- -- Stop
She catches her breath, disoriented, confused
Then she turns to find Edward lying beside her, looking at her
It
wasn't a dream
Go back to sleep
You've been through a lot
108
No, you might -- 'll be here when you wake up
Beat, she looks at him, wary
Why
Out of guilt
(realizing) You
think  asked the Volturi to kill me because  felt guilty
Didn't you
went to them because  thought 'd lost you
You didn't even want me
Now Edward takes her by the shoulders
Bella
The only reason  left was to protect you
wanted you to have a chance at a normal, happy life
But it was so easy for you to leave
had to be convincing
But easy
In my hundred years, 've never had a harder time than what  just went through
She's beginning to believe him
kept seeing you
Visions of you
Always protecting me
thought  was going crazy
Your own instincts were speaking to you
wish it had been me
But you're the heroic one
You saved me
109
He moves to kiss her
but abruptly stops
Suddenly -- swings open - she spins toward it as the flip on and Charlie enters
Edward is gone
You alright
Another nightmare
'm okay
You don't have to worry
Last time you said that, you disappeared
You want to talk nightmares
(sincere) 'm really sorry, Dad
Just
don't ever do that to me again
Okay
(off her nod) And you're grounded for the rest of your life
know
Get some rest so  can keep lecturing you in the morning
He kisses her forehead
Exits
beat
she turns to find Edward sitting on the bed
He won't forgive me easily
Nope
Will you
don't deserve it but hope you will
Because  honestly have no idea how to live without you
Bella melts in his eyes
He kisses her
You won't be able to get rid of me once Alice changes me
110
She won't have to
There are ways to keep the Volturi in the dark
(pulling away) They'll come after your whole family
You'd risk that just to keep me human
Just
You really don't understand what you'd be giving up
really do
They look at each other; an impasse
She decides something, grabs her jeans, pulls them on-- You're not the only one with a say in it
-   - -- You all know what Edward wants
And you know what  want
But  won't force myself on you
who surround Bella
The house has been restored to it's original warmth and beauty
Edward sits off to the side as Bella addresses them
think the only fair way to handle this is by vote -- You can't be serious -- (firmly) This is my meeting, Edward
Edward, frustrated, sits back
She faces the family again
However this turns out, 'm not letting the Volturi hurt you
'll go back to Italy alone -- 111
The hell you will
'm not missing another fight
That's not up for a vote, Emmett don't want you involved
We've always been involved, honey, and we're not going to stop -- No, please --  want you to seriously think about this
If  join you, you'll be stuck with me for a long time - forever
It's a huge decision
And  want -  need your honesty here
They nod or otherwise communicate agreement
Then let's take a vote
Alice
Alice jumps up and hugs Bella
Like you're not already my sister
Of course, yes
Bella smiles
Jasper rises, but keeps his distance
vote yes
It'll be a relief not to want to kill you
Um
Thanks
Okay, Rosalie
Rosalie, torn, looks at Edward who's stony toward her
Edward, 'm sorry for what  did really am
And  know you're not ready to forgive me
(to Bella) But this isn't the life 'd have chosen for myself
wish there'd been someone to vote no for me
(she exchanges a glance with Carlisle - then
) So
no
112
Bella takes it stoically
Emmett bounds over and lifts Bella into a bear hug
vote hell yeah
We can pick a fight with these Volturi some other way
Esme approaches and embraces Bella warmly
already think of you as part of the family
Yes
Thank you, Esme
Carlisle moves, not to Bella, but to -- Edward -- You can't go along with this, Carlisle, you know what it means
You've chosen not to live without her, which leaves me no choice
won't lose my son
(turns to Bella) But Alice has never turned anyone
It'd be safer if  did it -- The front door suddenly
Edward's gone
Bella blanches but turns to the family
Thank you
Thank you all
- --  '  watching the house down below
Off her seething fury -- : - has pulled over to the side of the road The , a middle-aged man smiles -- Where you headed
113
Seattle
(a slow grin) Sounds perfect
As she climbs in
'  - Edward drives Bella home
He is somber
She is resigned
When
After graduation
Just two months
It'll be best for Dad that way
can pretend to be at college somewhere
Carlisle suggested it
But
(quiet, emotional) wish you'd be the one to change me
(beat) Would you be willing to trade for that
(hopeful) Name it
Five more years as a human
The Volturi won't wait that long
'll settle for three
(sadly, shakes her head) won't risk it
It'll have to be Carlisle
He takes her hand
114
Why are you so willing to give up your soul
Because  don't believe you've lost yours
And  want to share mine with you forever
He looks to her, kisses her hand
then suddenly Edward on the brakes -- - -- Someone stands in the road directly in front of them -- it's
He glares, then turns and walks into the woods
What is he doing
He wants to talk to me
Well, he can talk to me first
She pushes out of the car -- - Edward and Bella tramp through the woods to  -- Jacob leaning against a tree
His expression is hard
You're still alive
've been calling you
Couldn't drop by
He thinks 'm keeping you away
(spinning on him) Stay the hell out of my head
Dad grounded me, Jake
We're trying to get back before he wakes up
115
Jacob doesn't buy it
Bella is frustrated
But Edward takes a step toward Jacob
Calm
Diplomatic
Jacob,  know you have something to say to me, but 'd like to say something first
Alright
Jacob leans back against the tree, arms folded, waiting
(sincere) Thank you
For keeping Bella alive when
didn't
No, you didn't
And it wasn't for your benefit, trust me
know
'm still grateful
(then) But 'm back now
And 'm not leaving Bella's side till she orders me away
She looks at him
He returns the look
Jacob sees the devotion between them
It wounds him
But he masks it
We'll see
Either way, we'll handle Victoria from here on out
She's been laying low
Ever since your freaky sister showed up
Guess she can't stand you Cullens either
She'll come back
She does, she's ours
She killed on our turf
We'll see
My turn to talk
'm here to remind you about a key point in the Treaty
116
(reads his thoughts, nods) haven't forgotten
Good
What
What key point
If any of them bites a human, the truce is over
That's bite, not kill
(realizing) But
if  choose it, it's none of your business
Jacob is horrified, starting to shake with rage
If you
what
No
No way won't let you -- -- Bella, step back -- You're not gonna be one of them
That's not your call -- (even more intense) You know what we'll do to you - won't have a choice -- We're done here -- Edward takes Bella's arm, starts to pull her away
Jacob lunges, trying to extract Bella from him -- You don't speak for her
Edward  Jacob away; he flies back ten feet in the air, but mid-air he
117
-- The Jacob-wolf lands on all fours, spinning to face Edward in an attack stance
Edward shifts stance, as well, readying for a fight -- Stop
Edward and Jacob circle one another, seconds from lunging -- (to Bella) Get out of here
Now
But Bella races between them, forceful, insistent
(to both of them) You do this, you'll be going through me
long tense beat, none of them backing down - it could go either way -- swear to God, 'm not moving
Both rivals see she's dead serious
Edward backs off, ever- so-slightly
the Jacob-wolf does the same
(turning to Edward) Give me a second
Please
Edward shakes his head
Doesn't move an inch
Read his thoughts
Is he going to hurt me
Edward does, and finally, reluctantly backs away
But his eyes never leave the wolf's
They glare at one another
Bella carefully approaches the Jacob-wolf, blocking his line of sight
Her voice is kind, pleading
Jacob,  love you
You're my best friend
But
can't change how feel
Please don't make me choose
(quietly, emotionally) Because it'll be him
It's always been him
118
Anguish sweeps through the wolf's fierce face
It's even harder to take than when he's in human form -- But you know how important you are to -- Suddenly, the wolf  out of there
- fighting tears as she watches him disappear
(
) There were problems ahead
Seemingly insurmountable
Edward's arms wrap around her from behind
(
) If  didn't become a vampire, the Volturi would kill me
If  did, my best friend would do the job himself, or get killed in the attempt
She turns to face Edward, looking into his loving eyes
(
) Victoria was still on the loose, putting everyone  loved in danger
He kisses her tenderly, washing away her concerns
(
) But 'd already survived the worst -- losing Edward
So  knew  could survive anything
'm here
Always
And she sees that's the truth, believes it
He takes her hand and together they turn, heading out of the woods
(
) And soon, 'd be like him
We'd face our fate together
Forever
Off them, hand in hand, inseparable
as we begin to -- : the agonized  of a wolf in the far distance
