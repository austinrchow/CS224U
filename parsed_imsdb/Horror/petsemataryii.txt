We hear the clap and roll of

Mid-30s
Cultured beauty
Her dress and face are smeared with grime and
is that blood we see too
God only knows what's happened to her
Genvieve ducks under a monstrous cobweb as she passes an open window
streaks across the night sky outside
We catch a glimpse of the  disappearing behind the clouds
Genvieve reaches the bottom of the stairs
The tomb itself
Water trickles in through cracks in the lichen-covered walls, pooling on the tomb floor
Genvieve moves forward, her lantern throwing distorted shadows over everything
In front of her is Anton LeMarche's stone sarcophagus
Genvieve kneels in the water, one hand resting on the spiked iron railing which surrounds the tomb
She reaches the other hand towards a scum-covered plaque, brushing the grime away
and  reach a crescendo as
rises out of the water, reaching for her
Genvieve
The lantern falls from her grasp, sputtering out
The hand reaches for her arm and inadvertently clutches her breast instead
Genvieve starts to laugh hysterically
(
) (exasperated) Cut
Thank you, Renee
Can we throw some light on the set
'm sorry
Suddenly it is lighter
Genvieve can't stop laughing
The groping monster hand disappears back beneath the water
,  - It's not 1865
The LeMarche Castle tomb is in fact, a 90s movie set
We are inside a soundstage, on a raised set, so the slugline should really read

Her name is actually   and her beauty is undeniable, even in such a disheveled state
This is great,  could've spent four months on a romantic comedy with Warren Beatty, and instead, 've got a horny zombie trying to cop a feel
The crew members
She's well-liked on the set
Renee grins
Wardrobe and make-up personnel move in to adjust Renee's appearance
Uhgh, there's water everywhere

The -  pulls a pack of cigarettes from her fanny-pack and offers Renee one
In a flash, a
appears with a lighter
Renee mumbles "thanks" as she fires up
She squints her eyes, trying to see past the set lights
(calling out) Geoff
(beat) Anybody see my boy
(
) Right here, Mom
, Renee's 12 year-old son steps into view
Renee's face lights up when she sees him
How long have you been here
Couple minutes
saw the last shot
That was pretty cool
Renee grimaces as the make-up girl spritzes her face with a spray- bottle
(casually) How did it go with your father last night
Good
He said he'd be over for dinner at eight
(awkward) mean
he misses you, Mom
miss him too
(continuing) just don't want you to get your hopes up, okay
We're trying to work things out, but
Her voice trails off
know, Mom
(affectionate) You know everything, don't you
Renee and Geoff are interrupted by a  who's spraying "atmosphere" about the set with a hand-held smoke machine
Renee coughs
Off-set, the
is trying to get the show on the road
Okay, people
Quiet
We're going to try this another time
Guess it's showtime
Yep
Renee kisses Geoff on the forehead
He takes the cigarette from her and moves off the set, standing near the camera
The director turns back toward Renee
Alright, Renee
Last time promise
We nail this and you won't have to do this ever again
That's what you said the first time
Renee turns and heads back toward the stairs
hands her a new lantern
As she reaches the stairs, the house lights dim, creating the proper atmosphere once again

It's cramped

Electricity surges through Renee
Her body jerks and writhes like some nightmarish marionette
- The electrician drags the puppeteer back
Sparks fly

We've crossed over into 220
Shut down the generator
- Crewmembers  and scramble back
All the circuits are blowing, lights  and showering sparks over the whole set
This is not part of the movie
It's awful
She shakes, her   frozen to the iron railing by the electricity running through her
Suddenly, Renee falls forward against the iron
Her face begins to The lights   , casting a strobic effect over the soundstage, adding to the chaos

He tries to rush forward, but someone restrains him

Suddenly all the circuits in the stage are blown and the Renee slumps back into the water, smoke trailing up from her still form
And we

He's good with the dog
He's kind
The retriever's owners: a  and her , look on

He's a very old dog
He has arthritis
He has cataracts in his eyes
Chase looks at the mother
He's always hated this part
He's had a good life
(to dog) haven't you, boy
Doctor Matthews, your son is on line one
He says it's an emergency
Chase breaks concentration, pulling his eyes away from the mother and son
,     - blur of activity converges on the movie set Medical equipment
Horrified crewmembers watch on, helpless
Geoff, momentarily blocked out and then revealed again and again, amidst the commotion of paramedics scrambling to save Renee
The director has his hand on Geoff's shoulder
Geoff's eyes dart about, taking it all in
Things are happening very fast: --Renee's hand is lifted
Someone checking her pulse
--Her eyelids parted
pen light flashing at her fixed pupils

) Run me down a line of normal saline
--An
needle plunges into the inside of Renee's elbow

--The monitor screen blinks to life

--The monitor shows erratic heartbeat

) She's in -fib
--There's a renewed urgency even amidst their rush
--Defibrillator paddles are pressed to her chest
Geoff looks to the monitor as
--It goes to flatline
(
) Clear
No
Geoff moves forward, pulling away from the director
The police officer moves in and intercepts Geoff, turning the boy away
Geoff's eyes fix on the monitor
An unbending flatline
You have to bring her back
Chase rushes onto the set, pushing past crewmembers
He freezes at the sight of the horrific commotion around Renee's still form
Oh Jesus
Chase's gaze connects with his son
(helpless) Dad
We pull back from Geoff, Chase, and the commotion around Renee
Farther and farther as the darkness around the set begins to close in

The baggage handlers laugh as they walk off into the distance
The fog closes around them and we

Off in the distance, a crowd of  are gathered around a grave

It reads, simply: 1955-1991 (
) She that believeth in me, though she were dead, yet shall she live; and whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die
is slowly lowered into the open grave
As it descends, Geoff and his father, Chase, standing at the forefront of the crowd
Renee's grave is next to those of her parents
Among the mourners is  , an attractive local girl in her early twenties
Further down the hillside, a wall of   are gathered behind a roped-off media boundary
There is a blinding flurry of as the press records the scene before them
'    cruises up the cemetery drive, pulling to a stop near the mob of reporters
Out of the car steps
Gus is nearly forty, with a Sheriff's uniform fitted to his solid, ageless frame
Gruff, maybe a little self-important: Gus likes being a big fish in a small pond
(drawing near) Let's keep it back, folks
Try to show her a little respect
ducks under the media boundary, moving in for a closer shot
He doesn't make it two steps before he's intercepted by Gus
Gus grabs the reporter and shoves him back
Hey
What did  just say
Gus means business
One look into his eyes reveals his intense, no nonsense approach
Ass-hole
The reporter backs off
- Beneath the gloomy, ominous skies, the lines on Chase's face shade him as a decade older than his thirty-five years
Chase gently places a comforting hand on Geoff's shoulder
Geoff inches forward, pulling free of Chase's touch
Drawn to his mother, drawn from his father
The only blemishes on his youthful, rosy cheeks are the tears, the endless tears
(
) know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth
Geoff looks upon the casket, gazing into the abyss of despair
The crowd has dispersed
Geoff is standing at the base of Renee's grave
His eyes fixed
Unmoving
Unaccepting
Chase is nearby, watching, not wanting to intrude on Geoff's private moment
Gus quietly moves in at Chase's side
Did she always have reporters following her around like this
Pretty much so
Gus glances at Geoff
hear you moved into town
wanted to get Geoff out of Just start things over, you know
Gus nods
Now his eyes fall on Renee's headstone
remember when Renee left
She couldn't wait to get out of Ludlow
She used to say that life moved too slow here
Chase forces a smile
That's Renee alright
suppose so
The sky above seems heavy with imminent rain and we
: 12 15 - Lazy oaks embrace a vintage, two-story Victorian home in the rural neighborhood of Ludlow, Maine
commercial   is parked out front
Marjorie, the girl we saw at Renee's funeral, is coming down the sidewalk
She checks the address on the front of the house, then heads up the driveway
Moving boxes clutter the downstairs
Chase is weaving through the maze, doing an inventory on the boxes
sweaty    are climbing up the stairs
Each is hunched  over, with a garment box balanced on his back
The side of each carton is boldly labeled:  -
(
) We've got six more of these
You sure you want them all in the attic
Chase is contemplating a compromise when Geoff appears from the kitchen doorway
Geoff, what if we just give the clothes to Goodwill
We'll keep the rest
Just the clothes
Geoff shakes his head, firm and deliberate denial
You're the one who wanted to move
Nobody would've touched them if you didn't want to move here
Chase weakens, giving in
All the 'Renee' boxes go in the attic
Sorry
Marjorie  on the open frame of the front door
Geoff recognizes her from his mother's funeral
She flashes him a warm smile
Hi
'm Marjorie Hargrove
Your new housekeeper
Marjorie has a naive, friendly quality about her
She's also blessed with eye-popping genetics
Standing there outside the door, looking more than a little nervous
we can't help but like her
Needless to say, she doesn't look like your typical housekeeper
(re: Chase's reaction) Is something wrong
Uh
no
You just
look different than you sounded on the phone
Please, come in
Marjorie enters
She grins at Geoff again
Yep
She's nervous alright
'm real excited about working for you Mr
Matthews
Well we're glad to have you, Marjorie
You can call me Chase, by the way
Marjorie passes her curious eyes over one of Renee's garment containers
've always admired Ms
Hallow
That scene she did in Blue Midnight, where her lover meets her at the train station
(she sighs) must've watched that movie four times
Chase smiles
Marjorie's enthusiasm is endearing
Just then, one of the movers loses his grip
garment box bounces down the slope of the stairs
When it reaches the bottom, dresses spill over the floor
Oh
'll get that
Marjorie moves for the spill
The first dress she touches is a beaded peach evening gown
Her fingers linger on the fabric
This is gorgeous
She wore this at the Emmys, didn't she
Geoff moves forward, acting overly defensive
Hey, don't touch her stuff
It made her crazy when people touched her stuff
Marjorie is taken aback by the oddity of Geoff's statement
Chase catches her eye, shrugging apologetically
17 19 - is parked outside
The rear side panel is masked off with tape and a stencil
Chase grabs the corner of the tape and carefully peels it back, revealing a crisp, new business logo: ,
Serving Aroostook County - Shops and businesses situated around a lazy town square
QUiet
Relaxed
As rural as they come
pick up Chase's van as it cruises by
- Chase pulls the van in front of an unassuming veterinary office
On the door is Chase's nameplate
And on the weathered wall is an outline of letters where the name and title "Quentin Yolander, Doctor of Veterinary Medicine" once was
Geoff is first out of the van
- Geoff and Chase move inside
The offices look like they were built in the 40s
dark corridor stretches down the center of the suite
Faded green walls are solid, with few exteriors
It's creepy in here
Heavy, grey plastic curtains absorb much of the light which does find its way in
Nothing looks like it's been updated in the past fifty years
This doesn't look so bad
Chase sweeps a curtain aside, revealing the interior to Geoff
Dust swirls in the air
How long ago did this guy retire
It's been a few years
Geoff takes a look around, growing uncomfortable
(skeptical) few
Geoff moves on down the central corridor which seems to grow darker and more dismal with every step
He moves on into the boarding room
- Rows of kennels are stacked along the walls, smothered with cobwebs
Ancient, rusted surgical equipment is scattered everywhere
The place is a mess
Windows are boarded up and shadows cloak the room
Over to the right, Geoff hears a
on one of the shelves jiggles
Something is moving around inside it
Geoff's eyes widen
Still, morbid curiosity propels him forward
The box rustles again
He reaches for it and
out at him,
Geoff  and jumps back
The box tumbles over and
crawls out
Behind the protective mother, are four of the cutest kittens we've ever seen,  away
Geoff sighs just as Chase rushes into the room
What's wrong
(embarrassed) Nothing
just got spooked by a bunch of furballs
Inside the box is a note
Chase reaches for it
It reads: "And a warm welcome to you
" Great, now 've opened an orphanage too
One of the kittens pads out of the box and looks up at Geoff with sleepy eyes
Her fur is striped
Well, 'll take one
If it's okay
Geoff lifts the fragile creature, cradling it in his arms
She looks like a tiger
Chase spies an old broom resting in the corner
Tell you what, you do some sweeping up here, and she's yours
Geoff nods and Chase moves back out into the hallway
Geoff sets the box back upright and lowers Tiger in with the other kittens
He reaches for the broom and goes to work sweeping away the cobwebs
Just as soon as he turns his back, Tiger climbs the side of the box, spilling over onto the floor
Chase is unpacking a shipment of medical supplies
When he places them in the cabinet, he stirs up a layer of dust
Tiger scampers by as Chase coughs his way out of the cloud of dust
Tiger sees the front door ajar
And as she approaches to explore what lies beyond-- The door swings open
,    is staring back at her
He's black and white with blue eyes, with a mask that is at once menacing and majestic
pudgy thirteen year old boy, , has a hold of the dog's collar
Zowie's  sends Tiger scrambling
Drew loses his grip as Zowie yanks free
strong, paternal command calls after Drew from outside
(
) Drew, you get a handle on that dog, now
Chase spins around at the commotion as Tiger darts across the floor with the barking dog in pursuit
Mayhem ensues as Zowie's big paws slip on the slick tile
Geoff rushes in from the boarding area
Tiger ducks beneath the back of a surgical gurney
Zowie's snoot wedges beneath the base, inches from Tiger's tiny, striking paw
Drew slides in on his knees, renewing his hold on Zowie's collar
He pulls the dog back
Geoff rescues Tiger from beneath the gurney
Drew shrugs sheepishly
Sorry
He gets kinda hyper
Drew's stepfather, Gus Gilbert, enters
The dreaded, domineering voice of authority in Drew's life
know him as the sheriff at Renee's funeral
Hell, he thought it was lunch
How ya doin', Chase
(a handshake) You haven't met my boy
(aside) Drew, where the hell are your manners
Drew steps forward and awkwardly offers his hand to Chase
Then Geoff
The boys shake
He's a cool lookin' dog
Zowie lurches forward, eager to shower affection on Geoff
Geoff strokes the dog's soft mane
What's his name
Zowie
Drew puts his palm under Zowie's chin and turns him for Chase to see
There are several scabbed-over gashes on his left cheek
Damn dog stuck his nose in on my rabbits and they ganged up on him
swear that dog's an idiot
Is he gonna be okay
With one eye on Zowie, Chase sprays some antiseptic on the examination table and wipes it clean
Let's have him hop up here
Drew prods Zowie
Zowie jumps up onto the table
Chase looks over the facial lacerations, then turns on a penlight and examines the dog's eyes
Gus passes a lingering look over Tiger
He reaches in to pet her, making sure it meets with Geoff's approval
When  was young  thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys
There are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes
Drew perks up at the thought, but Gus shoots it down
Not our home
Chase takes the light out of Zowie's eyes
He looks to Gus
Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly
'll give you som antibiotic cream-- --Drew, he's your dog
Are you listening to this
Chase turns to Drew and continues
His left eye is scratched, corneal abrasion
Eyedrops will help, but it's going to take som time
Try to keep him away from those rabbits, huh
Drew nods, casting a glance aside at Gus
(to Chase) hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now
How'd you know that
Gus gives Chase a knowing grin
It's a small town, Chase
Gus laughs and claps Chase on the shoulder
Hey Geoff, did you know your mother and  used to be high- school sweethearts
Geoff is surprised at this
Surprised and annoyed
Tact isn't a quality that Gus possesses in abundance
Really
(nodding) Homecoming
Prom
Whole nine yards
(to Chase) Course that was a lifetime ago
- are converging en masse for classes
Chase's van pulls up front
- Chase digs some cash out of his wallet
Geoff stares out at the school
He's dreading this
What's a lunch cost these days
You want ten
(unenthused) Sure
Chase looks at his son
You nervous
New town, new school
know it must be pretty hard for you
(cutting him off) 'll be fine, Dad
Geoff reaches for the door, but Chase stops him
He's trying to reach his son
He really is
(awkward) Geoff
you have to help me out here a little
"
" Chase drops his eyes to the bulge squirming around in Geoff's jacket
He can't help but smile
Are you sure you don't want me to pick you up
It's a long ride
Geoff opens the side panel of the van and slips out his That's what my bike's for
Before Chase can say another word, Geoff is gone
- As Chase pulls away,   the handmade sign taped in the back window: - Drew is among a small circle of
He recognizes Geoff walking his bike from the van
The largest of the boys, , takes notice of the unfamiliar face
Clyde is fifteen, going on twenty
You know the type: local bully, held back a year or two
Check it out
That's the new kid
The son of that movie star
Mischief gleams in Clyde's eyes as he watches Geoff's every move
The other boys follow suit
Clyde always takes the lead
Geoff fields their penetrating stares
For a second his eyes connect with Clyde's, then he moves on into the building
Among the boys, Drew is the reluctant participant
- is addressing a room of
Geoff is doodling in his notebook, feeling acutely out of place as he tries to avoid the curious glances the rest of his new classmates are giving him
People, this is Geoff Matthews
He'll be joining our class for the rest of the school year
As Mrs
Gordon points to him, Geoff drops his face even lower
This is the worst embarrassment a boy could ever suffer
He'd like to throttle Mrs
Gordon
freckle-faced boy, , fires off a question
Hey, what's Hollywood like
Do you know Eddie Murphy
(annoyed) No
Why don't we save that for later, Doug
girl with braces, , continues the interrogation
What about Julia Roberts
Susan
That'll be enough
Susan shuts up
Geoff sinks even lower in his seat
The kids turn their eyes back to the front of the room
But one classmate's eyes are still on Geoff
It's Clyde
Clyde shifts his stare to the squirming lump in Geoff's jacket
He catches a glimpse of Tiger's bobbing nose popping out
- Geoff joins the stampede of kids as the  releases them for the day
Almost immediately, Clyde and his cronies,   , fall in step behind him
Drew hangs slightly off to the side, not really wanting to be a part of the intimidation
What's the hurry, Junior
Where you off to
Clyde quickens his pace, pulling ahead of Geoff and stopping in front of him
Stevie and Brad move in on either side
Surrounded by peers, it's apparent how small Geoff is for his age
On the wall next to them is a bulletin board display
Clyde glances at it
Geoff follows his gaze
It's one of those corny school affairs with construction paper letters spelling out: "
" Beneath that are pictures of Renee clipped from various magazines
Cloyingly tasteless
(feigning remorse) Too bad about your Mom
Papers said it was pretty gross, getting fried like that
Guess you saw it, huh
Geoff nods
Clyde raises his eyebrows, pulling Geoff's jacket open
So, what are you hiding there
When you bring a friend to school you're supposed to introduce him
Geoff's arm tightens protectively around Tiger
Her name's Tiger
Tiger
Don't you think that's kind of a pussy name
(reaching out) Can  hold her
promise 'll be real careful
Clyde has a convincing way about him
Geoff reluctantly hands the kitten over
Clyde is so gentle with the creature that one would never question his sincerity
Geoff is just beginning to feel at ease when something changes in Clyde's tone, something sinister
Hey, Geoff
You ever seen a kitten run
've seen her run around the house
Clyde's eyes narrow
He takes a couple of steps back
Geoff's heart starts to sink
No,  mean really run
(beat) Like this
Clyde backsteps and bolts off down the hallway with Tiger
Brad and Stevie fall in behind him, laughing
Drew shrugs apologetically
He's torn, but he tears off after them nonetheless
Shit
Geoff runs off in pursuit of them
- Geoff rushes from the building, searching the dispersing crowd
There they are, tearing from the bike racks, pedaling for the street
Clyde sees Geoff and mockingly holds the kitten out for display as they ride by
Geoff runs for the bike racks
- Clyde and his cohorts break from the outskirts of town, riding out onto the open road
Clyde glances back toward the center of town
Geoff is so far behind he's barely visible
Clyde returns his eyes to the road ahead, raising Tiger nose to nose with him
Having fun yet
Clyde and his smirking buddies ride on,
giving the pedals all he can, struggling to keep pace with the boys
35 Scattered houses sprinkle the landscape ahead
Cochran Lake stretches into the distance beyond the housing
Clyde's clan cuts from the road and blazes a trail across a residential property
The two-story house is weathered and boarded up
It looks vaguely familiar
Creepy
And when   the mailbox post, we know why
The name is faded, but there's no question who once lived there
Five bold letters: "
" Geoff whips by in a blur, still in pursuit
- Clyde and his friends have abandoned their bikes
They've taken position on top of the slope of the hill, standing at the foot of 38 - Geoff pulls his bike to a stop short of the boys
He dismounts and leans it up against a tree
Just give me the cat, all right
devilish grin creeps over Clyde
He strolls down the path toward Geoff
Clyde grabs Geoff's handlebars and, backing up, pulls Geoff and the bike with him
would but
there was a little accident
(feeding off Geoff's alarm) She was trying to get away
You know, running down my leg
and her head got too close to the spokes
Pretty gross
What's left of her is up in the Pet Sematary
zip-lock bag might help
(shrugs) but  happen to be out of them at the moment
Drew shakes his head, disgusted he has to put up with Clyde's antics
Come on, Clyde, just tell him where the cat is
(turning on Drew) where the cat is
Now shut up, fuck-face
Clyde punches Drew in the arm
Drew shrinks back
Geoff flashes a hateful stare at Clyde
All of the boys but Clyde are uncomfortably silent
There's something frightening about Clyde
something that extends beyond the standard bully antics
We begin to get the feeling that this kid is genuinely deranged
(relishing the moment) You heard about the Creed murders yet
And the place where the dead come back to life
He motions to the path behind him
(continuing) It's just back there
Just down that path
(meekly) Clyde
it's not funny anymore
Oh
So you got a problem
What're you gonna do, fat-ass
You gonna sic big, bad, old Gus after me
Drew shuts up
Clyde turns back to Geoff, drawing closer
What do you think, Geoff
Maybe you could dig up your Mom and take her back there
Maybe if you pray real hard, she'll come back
With this last remark Clyde has pushed too far
Geoff's face is red with anger
(quietly) Just give me the cat, ass-hole
Clyde's grin falters a moment
Excuse me, maybe 'm a little hard of hearing
but did you just call me an ass-hole
Clyde pokes Geoff in the shoulder
You mad, Geoff
Cause if you are, you should take a shot at me
This time Clyde shoves Geoff back even harder
Come on, you pussy
What's the matter with you
Clyde moves forward again and Geoff suddenly  , catching everyone off guard
For an instant, Drew marvels at Geoff's tenacity
Clyde
He hammers Geoff with blows
Outsizing him by forty pounds, Clyde tosses Geoff to the ground
Geoff struggles, but Clyde's grip proves arresting
Clyde throws Geoff onto his stomach, forcing his face into the dirt
It looks as if he's ready to smother his opponent
Drew is the first to rush in
Brad and Stevie quickly follow
It takes all three of them to peel Clyde off Geoff
Clyde gets to his feet and backs away
There's great pleasure in his crazed eyes as he watches Geoff coughing and gasping
Fuckin' ass-hole
Satisfied he's handed out enough ill will for the day, Clyde turns away
Drew's attentions remain on Geoff
As Clyde strolls by, he grabs Drew's arm and swings him around
This way, fat-boy
Stevie and Brad follow
As the group passes Geoff's bike, Clyde gives it a kick, knocking it over
Then they're gone
Geoff pulls himself to his feet
Brushing off the mess, he heads up the path in search of Tiger
- The woods here have grown long with shadows
The air is still and the sound of birds is conspicuously absent
frames the entrance to the primitive graveyard
Scrawled across the weatherstained boards is a child's barely legible attempt at "
" Geoff trepidatiously enters the clearing of crude, crowded graves
Collars, leashes, bird cages and other accessories adorn the makeshift crosses and headstones
Geoff moves along the outer circle of markers, each crafted by a child's caring hands
As he searches, he can't help but notice the heartfelt epitaphs
On the outer circle, he sees a crate-board marker memorializing: , the markers are older
The ones he can still read convey a sense of the perpetual cycle of life and death
Here is a wide, flat, upright board planted deep in the earth: "In Memory of  our Pet Rabit Dyed March 1 1965
" The next three rows are illegible, the inscriptions are weathered beyond recognition
And then, chiseled into sandstone: 1929-1939
And now
"
" Faint
But very much alive
Geoff picks up his pace, weaving quickly toward the center
There, he finds Tiger
Trapped in a rusted old birdcage, its base swallowed by the grave
Geoff opens the door and frees Tiger, stroking the trembling kitten
Geoff's eyes are drawn to the far perimeter
to the deadfall
looms on the outskirts of the clearing like a pile of skeletal remains
An abstract stairway to things beyond
wind picks up just then, sending leaves skittering in waves across the ground
40 - When Geoff turns around, he finds Drew waiting for him under the archway
Drew smiles, full of respect for Geoff
've never seen anybody punch Clyde before
(shrugs) He pissed me off
(his smile fading) Sorry about your mom
(beat) couldn't handle not having my mom around
Just having Gus
He grimaces at the thought
My dad's not so bad
Drew glances around at all the makeshift grave markers
swear, sometimes  wish Gus was dead
(serious) You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad
Stepdad
Gus is my stepdad
Geoff nods knowingly
What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life
Nothing
It's just an old ghost story
Let's get out of here
They head off, full of childhood
- Marjorie is at the stove, fixing up dinner, while Chase scans the newspaper at the table
Geoff enters through the kitchen door
He moves past them without a word
(calling after him) Hey
How was your first day at school
(over his shoulder) It sucked
Now is that any way to talk to your father
Geoff stops for a moment, turns
You're not my mother
and exits through the opposite door
Chase looks to Marjorie and offers a sympathetic shrug
Sorry
'  - Situated alongside the garage
sign above the cages reads:   - $10
00
Bells positioned along the roof threaten to reveal foul play
Gus is rigging a wire along the base of the cage
Finishing it off, he hangs the plug next to an outside socket
Moving onto the next chore, he pours pressed alfalfa pellets into feeding slots for the hungry rabbits
Setting the feed aside, he takes a seat
Opening one of the cages, he grabs a rabbit and sets it on his lap, gently petting its soft fur
One of the cages starts to vibrate
Gus gives it a look:     aren't interested in eating, they're joined in fast and furious passion
Gus gets a chuckle out of the sight
Way to go, Romeo
Gus replaces the rabbit in the hutch
And before he goes, An   dances along the base of the cage, a deterrent for intruders
- Drew's mother, , withdraws a roast from the oven
Gus is at the sink, washing his hands
He turns to see Zowie laying at Drew's feet in the living room
Drew is watching a on
Drew,  don't remember inviting Zowie in for dinner
Just until he heals up
Gus is waggling his thumb toward the back door
Drew slumps in defeat
Gus reaches into the cabinet and pours himself a Bourbon
'  - Drew walks Zowie from the house with a dish of dog food
As they pass the rabbit dens, Zowie alters his path
Drew gets a handful of his collar and pulls him back
Across the yard is an enclosed dog run
Twenty feet long by ten feet wide
Drew puts Zowie inside with the dog food
Drew strokes Zowie's mane affectionately, then backs away, closing the wood-framed door to the dog run
'  - Amanda's about to put the roast on the table when Gus nuzzles up behind her, breathing down her backside
With his drink in hand, he sweeps her hair aside and zeros in for a kiss on the back of the neck
Gus eases his free hand around between Amanda and the counter and presses his palm firmly into her crotch, drawing her body tight to him
She stiffens at his intimate hold, uncomfortable with his timing
Gus, please
At the back door, Drew is watching from beyond the screen, disgusted by the sight of Gus pawing his mother
Drew swings the door open as loud as he can to signal his return
Gus plants a last kiss on the back of Amanda's neck and backs off
But before he goes, he snatches a chunk of meat from the serving platter
Leveling his leering eyes at Amanda, he stuffs it into his mouth suggestively
God damn, you're good
Drew rolls his eyes and takes his seat at the table, returning his attention to the , where another   is on
Gus glances at the , annoyed by the
He drops into his spot at the head of the table, blocking Drew's view
Drew leans to the side for a better look
Gus takes notice and leans to the same side to obstruct his view
You're breaking the law here, Drew
Really, Gus
It won't bother me
Gus ignores her, inching forward with a confidential, harsh whisper
Your mom's spent the last hour cooking
Stop being a little jerk and show her some appreciation
Drew aims the remote control at Gus, as if to shut him up, and silences the
Amanda approaches with the roast
The moment it's on the table, Drew starts dishing up a hefty serving
Gus spears Drew's fork with the serving fork
Not that much appreciation thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass
Hey, 'm so sorry 'm not the stud that you are
Knock it off, guys
Gus throws back a sip of Bourbon
(to Drew, quietly) You watch that mouth of yours, Drew buddy
46 '   - Zowie's enclosed pen,   no sign of the dog
the door,   that the wood around the bottom hinge has been chewed through
The base of the door is ajar, just enough for a dog to have slipped through
- In the still of the night, Gus' rabbit pens sit unattended
And then   the tinkling of dog tags
Snoozing rabbits awaken as Zowie lumbers
Zowie rises on his hind legs, pressing his paws to a cage
Blue sparks fly as Zowie is jolted with the electrical charge
'  - The
The dog's whimpering
And the reach Gus in rapid succession, rousting him from his sleep
He rolls out of bed and grabs his robe
Damn it, Drew
That dog is history
Amanda stirs, groggily focusing on Gus' departing figure
'  - Drew swings open the door to the hallway as Gus marches by, stuffing shells into a shotgun
Panicked, Drew takes off after him
- Zowie swings his head in the direction of the house as Gus bursts through the back door
Drew is one step behind
Gus swings the gun up and fires off a
Zowie bolts for the shadows of the hillside
Drew rushes in and deflects the aim of the rifle
Don't shoot him
Gus' eyes are wild with anger
What, Drew
What did you say
Gus throws Drew aside, brings the rifle back up and  another random shot after the fleeing dog
All the while, his eyes remain on Drew, as if this were the boy's lesson to be learned
He squeezes off one more
echoes from the hillside
Zowie's yelp
Drew whips his head aside in sickened shock
Even Gus is sobered by the unexpected hit
All they can hear now are Zowie's   diminishing in the night
Drew shoots Gus a look of such unbridled hatred that Gus is speechless
He backs away from Gus and darts off toward the dark hillside
When Gus turns back for the house, Amanda is standing there
Jesus, Gus, what have you done
Ah, come on, Amanda, stop looking at me like that
He's had ample warning about that dog
Amanda glares at him, an outpouring of pent-up strain
Gus defiantly marches past Amanda, entering the house without ever meeting eyes with her
- Drew pauses long enough to listen for Zowie
Nothing until a   drifts back at him
Zowie limps
Blood is flowing from the bullet wound in his left hindquarter, trailing from his suspended leg
Every step is a strain
comes upon a break in the trees
The hanging moon outlines the knoll stretching beyond
And then, the strained breathing, the hushed
Drew hesitantly approaches the crest of the knoll
Zowie is just beyond, lying on his side at the end of the bloody trail
His chest rises and falls almost imperceptibly with every effort to survive
Drew drops to his knees at Zowie's side and cradles the dog in his lap, shaking his head in denial
Zowie's weak eyes shift, gazing longingly at Drew
Drew strokes the fur under Zowie's chin, hardly able to see the dog through his glaze of tears
Zowie's eyes drift off
His chest falls and doesn't rise again
He falls limp in Drew's arms
Drew hugs Zowie even tighter and he begins to weep
the image of Drew with the dog cradled in his arms, silhouetted against the moonlit horizon
: 53 '  - Geoff appears from the garage with his bike and takes off for the road
catches his ear
Drew is at the edge of the woods, beckoning for Geoff
Geoff circles around and doubles back
was just going by your house
Where's your bike
The closer Geoff gets, the more he sees of Drew's despair
Then he sees the dried blood staining Drew's clothes
Zowie's dead
Geoff's heart sinks
An unspoken moment of sympathy passes between the boys
Fighting the emotions, Drew finally speaks
have to bury him
don't want to go out there alone
There's such grief in Drew's words that Geoff can't resist
He glances toward his house to make sure he hasn't been seen, then blends into the woods
- Drew carries Zowie's relaxed form in his arms
Geoff is following, balancing a pickaxe and shovel
Arriving at the graveyard, Geoff searches the outer perimeter for a vacant stretch of soil
Finding one, he lets the heavy tools fall to the ground
Is this a good spot
'm not burying him here
Why not
There's a better place
Drew heads for the base of the deadfall, with Zowie in his arms
It's back here somewhere, through the Indian woods
know we can find it
Drew continues up the deadfall, disappearing over the crest
Geoff gathers up the shovel and pickaxe and follows after him
Hey, wait up
- Geoff climbs over the peak of the deadfall
Beyond is a dark swamp,  , looking unlike anything one would expect in Maine
Tendrils of ground fog swirl about vegetation that looks almost prehistoric
Gnarled trees rise up from the murky earth, blocking the sun from view
Geoff hurries down the other side of the deadfall to catch up with Drew
Somewhere off in the distance we hear an
Not a bird
Not any animal known to man
Spectral shapes flicker at the edge of Geoff's vision, sinking back into the shadows as Geoff tries to focus on them
(uneasy) Drew, where are we going
Drew doesn't respond
He continues on without another word, hell- bent on finding this "better place
" - At the boundary of the bog,    ,   rises from the blanket of ground fog
Bordered by fir trees
Leading up the hillside
The final leg of Drew and Geoff's journey
This is it
wasn't sure if it even really existed
What did
The old Indian burial ground
Geoff's eyes move to the stairway of stones
Come on, that's just a bullshit story
You said so yourself
What if it's not bullshit
If bury Zowie there, and it works
(beat) he'll come back alive
Drew,  know your dog died, but
get a grip, man, you're freaking me out
Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try
Geoff feels for Drew
It's pointless to reason
Drew starts up the stone steps
Geoff has no choice but to follow
- Even in broad daylight, the flat-topped mesa has a sense of foreboding isolation
There's an almost palpable sense of "wrongness" about this place
As if the darkness of a dying black hole was seeping out of the ground and spreading across the earth
Drew and Geoff approach the circle of rocky soil
They stand at the border, looking it over in eerie silence
Somewhere off in the distance we hear the unearthly  again, only this time, it's closer
Look, let's just get this over with
Even Drew seems to have awakened from the haze he had fallen into
He gently sets Zowie's body on the ground
If this doesn't work
don't ever tell anyone  did this, okay
You gotta promise
Geoff nods and hands over the digging tools
Drew swings the pickaxe, sinking it into the ground
You want me to help
You have to bury your own
That's the way the Indians did it
It's like a rule
Backing away from the burial ground, Geoff takes a seat on a rock at the border of the forest
From there, he watches
Drew alternates the pickaxe and shovel as he clears a hole in the rocky ground
, who's looking on with skeptical intrigue as the rhythmic  of the tools continues
59 - cairn is complete: a conical pile of rocks over Zowie's grave
Drew is now sitting on the rock next to Geoff
Together, they stare at the cairn as if Zowie might climb from beneath at any moment
What if he really does come back
Geoff shrugs, pondering such a thought
Geoff digs into his pocket and produces a pack of gum, offering one to Drew
With only a quick glance away from the grave, Drew snatches a piece and he stuffs it into his mouth
Geoff does the same
They sit together in silence
Nervously chewing their gum
Watching the grave
've never had anyone die before
(beat) but  guess you get over it mean, eventually
(quietly) You never get over it
- The sun dips over the horizon, giving way to dusk
- Geoff's eyes shift from the grave to the darkening sky
It's getting pretty late
We better go
(disappointed) Yeah
They rise, leaving the burial ground
En route, Drew pauses for a last look at the grave
So long, Zowie
Geoff follows, glancing back at the burial ground
It looks magical in the twilight, not quite so sinister now
- Drew is walking home along the road, alone
Headlights blind him as a car approaches
It slows and pulls a - turn, stopping at Drew's side
It's Gus' squad car
He pushes open the passenger door
Get in
Drew takes a step back, shaking his head
Your momma's worried sick over you
You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school
What're you trying to prove
'm not trying to prove anything
(beat) was burying my dog
Gus turns his eyes away, focusing on the dark road ahead
Life is full of lessons
No one's above it
Not you
Not me
Now get in the car
After a moment, Drew approaches the car
Without another word, Gus drives off
64 - It's quiet now
And out of the silence comes the  of Zowie's dog tags
Zowie's   creeps over the cage, distorted to monstrous proportion by the flickering light
We move past the cages to the back porch
We see '  scratching at the door
'  - Amanda wakens with a start
She rises, eyes focusing on the dark bedroom
Gus is sound asleep next to her
Then, from outside, we faintly hear '
Slowly, Amanda rises from bed, pulling on a bathrobe as she heads for the door
- Amanda appears at the door
She unlatches it, stepping outside
Zowie
Amanda looks down and
'  - Photos of Drew with Zowie are tacked on the wall above the bed
The one photo of Drew, Amanda and Gus has been altered with a cut- out head of Zowie's pasted on Gus' shoulders
Drew below
He's fallen asleep with his Walkman on
Even with his ears covered, the  at the door jolts him awake
Half asleep, Drew peels off the headphones
(
) Drew, you unlock this door
Right now
(
) Unlock it, Drew
The anger in his mother's voice brings him off the bed
Gus' continues
Drew moves to the door
The inside is secured by a double dead bolt
Instead of unlocking them, he opens a tiny, customized window which gives him a view of the hall
What did  do now
Open the door, Drew
Drew unlatches the deadbolts and steps back as Gus bursts through the door
Where do you come off lying like that
"'m burying my dog
" You think a lie like that's never gonna catch up to you
Drew backs into the bed, taking a seat
Amanda comes through the door, and behind her is
This is our first glimpse of the resurrected dog
Fur shiny and wet, the gaping gunshot wound in his rear
Zowie's head hangs low, his eyes
The husky is covered with dirt from head to toe
Drew's eyes widen in astonishment
Zowie staggers across the room towards Drew, nails clicking on the floorboards
Drew shrinks back in uncertain horror as the dog moves closer
Zowie absently throws his arms up onto the bed, across Drew's lap
And slowly, perfunctory, his tongue licks Drew's cheek
This last action of Zowie displaces Drew's fear
Tears well up in the boy's eyes
(a whisper) Zowie
Say your goodbyes
Zowie's going outside
You're grounded, buddy
That's the new law
Drew lifts his hand from stroking Zowie's fur
His palm is covered with muddy blood
never knew an open wound could smell so bad
(beat) Honey, he should have been looked at this morning
don't know what you were thinking
It's a wonder he's still alive
Drew gazes into the dog's vacant eyes
It truly is a wonder
' ,   - Chase enters and stops in the doorway
Geoff sits in front of the television with a pile of videotapes next to him
He's scanning through Renee's old movies with the remote
The sound has been turned down and the effect is a little eerie
We see  move through a scene
Geoff hits the slo-mo button and the image winds down
Renee's face
stare out at us from the alien universe of the past
(gently) Geoff
Geoff doesn't respond
He's captivated by Renee
Chase moves into the room
Geoff
Geoff  the tape
Renee freezes, the image flickering ever so slightly
For an instant, we think we see a   Renee being electrocuted
But it's only an instant
Finally, Geoff tears his eyes away from the screen, resenting his father's intrusion
What
You alright
Geoff's face softens
He nods
Dad
do you think
(beat) you think you and Mom would've gotten back together
Chase draws closer
He takes a seat next to Geoff
The pain in his son's eyes is almost more than he can stand
think so
(continuing) Your Mom and  loved each other, Geoff
Don't ever think that we didn't
still can't believe she's dead
Chase moves to reach for his son, and suddenly the phone , shattering the moment
Chase hesitates, but finally he rises and answers the phone
After a moment, he returns
Who was that
Remember Zowie, Drew's dog
He got hurt again
'm going over to take a look at him
Geoff's eyes widen
He looks like a ghost walked over his grave
'm going with you
Chase nods and exits to get his coat
Geoff looks back at the  once more
The image paused
Renee staring at us from beyond the grave
'  - Gus, Amanda, Drew and Geoff are gathered around Chase's van
/
'  - Chase lays Zowie on his side on an examining table and shines an overhead light onto the wound
Geoff is looking in from outside, utterly bewildered by the living, breathing dog
How'd it happen
Gus casts a threatening glance in Drew's direction
(glaring at Gus) Some psycho hunter probably got trigger happy
Chase is too busy preparing a syringe to notice the nonverbal exchange
'm going to give Zowie a local anaesthetic so  can clean up the wound
'd like to take him home tonight for observation
Fine
Can you keep him at your place until he gets better
Sure
Drew tenderly strokes Zowie's mane as Chase administers the injection
Zowie stares up at Geoff with dull, blank eyes
Drew reads Geoff's bewilderment and joins him outside the van
Their words are clear, but whispered
Maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him
He was dead
You know he was
Geoff returns his stare to Zowie
You can't tell anyone, Geoff
Ever
Geoff looks into Drew's eyes and nods in understanding
69 75 '  - Tiger is curled up at the foot of Geoff's bed
Geoff climbs in, careful not to disturb the kitten
As he lays his head back on the pillow
(
) Sleep tight, darling
'll be with you soon
It's a woman's
familiar one
Now we hear the rhythmic of a rocking chair
And with it comes the voice again, humming a
Wide-eyed, Geoff turns his head toward the source
'   is seated in the rocking chair across the room
Rocking forward, her face passes into a swath of moonlight
It's Renee
With the rock of the chair, her face recedes back into the shadows
Her soothing  remains
And again, her face passes into the swath of light
And again it retreats
Geoff raises his hand, reaching out for her
Renee's hand rises from the shadows, reaching for him
But suddenly,
The rocking chair and the bed seem distanced like polar extremes, mother and son hopelessly separated by forces beyond their control
in the bedside window
Renee is falling farther and farther away
Mom
Geoff leaps from his bed as the darkness closes in and
bolts up from his pillow
Awake now, face wet with perspiration
It was a nightmare
Except, if it was a nightmare, why do we still hear
the steady  of the rocking chair
Geoff slowly turns his head once again, repeating the actions of his dreams
In the shadows, the chair is still rocking
As it comes forward into the moonlight, we see , curled up asleep on the seat of the chair
Tiger is not on the bed anymore
She's up on top of the bookcase now, wide awake, eyes fixed on the dog
She
Geoff stares at the rocking chair, petrified
'  - Chase strips off the bandage over Zowie's rear end
The wound is gooey and open
Geoff reads the concern in Chase's expression
Drew is right there at Geoff's side, looking on
What's the deal
don't know
He's had three days
His immune system should've responded by now
Chase puts on his stethoscope and checks under the dog's rib-cage for a pulse
He checks a number of places, then shakes his head, totally confused
can't seem to find a pulse
it must be so weak, it's not registering
Geoff and Drew share conspiratorial glances as Chase sets the stethoscope aside and extracts a blood sample
Chase labels the capped vial of blood "" and carefully places it into a packing container
When he closes the lid, we see the preaddressed label: School of Veterinary Medicine Lab Samples Enclosed Uncomfortable with Chase's investigation, Geoff reaches for Zowie
We'll take him back to the kennels, Dad
78A - , shrinking to the back of their kennel
Zowie stands motionless before their cage, gazing in at them
Geoff and Drew are nearby, putting the finishing touches on the bedding inside a larger boarding kennel
You think my Dad'll figure out why he's not getting better
You think he'd believe it if he did
One of the kittens  fearfully at Zowie
Geoff turns to stare at Zowie
How can he not have a heartbeat
(worried) Maybe it takes a while
Drew lifts Zowie into the kennel
Geoff secures the door, something that clearly must be done from the outside
Zowie immediately begins to pace back and forth inside the cage
He turns towards us and we
: , '  - rushing at us
Chase jumps back, frightened out of his wits and we realize
The werewolf is part of a group of   out trick-or- treating
The kids  at Chase's reaction and hurry on, dragging their candy loot bags behind them
Chase sighs and turns to lock the office door
He's closing up for the night
He climbs into his Mobile Vet Van
We   the new sign in the back window: "
" Beneath that is a pencil-sketch of a black arched-back kitten
'  - Marjorie and Geoff are at the kitchen table with the remnants of dinner
Geoff is doing last-minute touches on his costume
Marjorie looks over his costume
He's got a hockey mask pushed back onto the top of his head
So who're you going as, Wayne Gretzky
For effect, Geoff slips the hockey mask down over his face before answering
'm going as Jason
Jason
Who's he play for
He doesn't
He hacks people up
Geoff checks his watch
'm late
As Geoff heads for the door, Chase is just coming in for the evening
Hey
Where're you off to
'm going out, Dad
Geoff ducks out the door
Chase turns to Marjorie
Out
He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary
Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years
What do they do up there
Oh, you know
drink beer, tell ghost stories
They try and spook each other out, talking about zombies and things
(she shrugs) It's no big deal, Chase
did it when  was young
'  - Drew is at the bathroom mirror
Hold still
Hold still
Amanda puts the finishing touches of color on Drew's lips
She's done an alarmingly good job of turning Drew into
You make sure you're home by ten
If Gus finds out  let you go
(sighs) 'll be home, Mom
Don't worry
won't let Gus blow up again
Amanda looks Drew straight in the eyes
Drew,  know Gus isn't your father, but you never even knew your real father
He walked out on the both of us, and you remember that
(beat) Gus isn't that way
He has it in him to love us both
You just have to give him a chance
Drew nods respectfully
Amanda gives him a kiss
Drawing back, she rubs out the lipmarks she's left on his made-up cheek
83 - Dark clouds paint the foreboding sky
broken pulse of lightning streaks through the dense haze
Abandoning their bikes next to the path, Drew and Geoff approach the archway
The graveyard beyond is deathly silent
They pass beneath the archway, entering the clearing
And now, a soft, chilling  drifts over the graves
(
) Geoff, honey
Mommy's here
Geoff freezes in his tracks, awestruck as
' swoops down from the darkness above, materializing out of nowhere
fluttering negligee
Flowing blonde hair
'  appears out of the shadows, masked with sadness
Geoff swallows the lump in his throat
Renee's form keeps coming
But even as she approaches, her visage grows less distinguishable
Just a phantom countenance now shadow framed by golden hair, resting atop a veiled body
She's coming so fast that she's upon Geoff in no time
He fumbles back, startled out of his wits
is upon him now, flailing wildly
Geoff thrashes and struggles, screaming bloody murder
Gradually, he realizes the body isn't fighting back
Geoff eases his struggle, lets his scream fall off
Now he hears wild, mischievous
Drew pulls the body away
It's just a heavy wad of stuffed clothing:   dressed in a negligee, capped by a blonde wig
It dangles near the end of a slanted wire
Clyde, Stevie, Brad, and a half dozen other costumed  appear from the nearby cover of bushes, doubled over in laughter
Clyde tugs at a piece of twine that's connected to the back of the dummy's head and makes spooky sounds
The dummy jumps around on the slanted wire
Clyde drops the dummy and saunters forward
Look at this, Junior here practically shit his pants
Clyde drops down, nose to nose with Geoff, who's still recovering
Maybe you're too chicken to hang out with the rest of the boys
You gonna run home to Daddy now
Geoff brushes himself off and rises to his feet
He stares into Clyde's eyes
Fuck off
Geoff pushes past Clyde and moves on into the graveyard, somehow managing to keep his dignity intact
Drew follows, then the rest of the boys, leaving Clyde staring after them, standing alone with the dummy
'  - Gus' squad car slows to a stop outside
Gus swings open the door and ambles toward the porch
'  - Amanda draws back from the window, mortified
She nervously crosses to the refrigerator and grabs a beer, turning as Gus enters
You're home early
Nope
Just ran out of smokes
Gus opens a kitchen drawer and fishes for a pack of cigarettes
He fires one up
Where's the boy
Amanda squirms
Uh
in his room
Gus tightens his brow, casting a suspicious eye
sickened look flushes through Amanda as Gus pulls his eyes away from her and marches upstairs
(
) His feet  down the hallway
Silence for an instant
Then the powerful swing of Drew's door
Followed by Gus' hastened return down the hallway
And as he hustles down the stairs
God damn it, Amanda
You want me to be a father to the boy, and as soon as  lay down the law, you let him break it
Gus stops before Amanda
Where is he
One step away from terror, Amanda shakes her head
Gus loses his patience
He rips the can of beer from her grip and sends it flying across the room
Amanda sighs in quiet defeat
The Pet Sematary
Gus turns away and heads out the door
'  - Wheels spin as Gus' squad car streaks off into the night
The cherry top glows to life, bombarding the countryside
- By now, nearly     have gathered at the Pet Sematary
In the midst of the graves, a small story-telling campfire burns
number of the boys sip beer, trying to pretend that the bitter after-taste doesn't bother them
Clyde sits up front
At fourteen, he's the elder statesmen of the group
With a beer in one hand, and a cigarette in the other, Clyde is just finishing up a spooky yarn
yeah, that old Louis was one sick fuck
digging up little Gage like so, maggots pouring out of that kid's eyes
Clyde whistles
He drags on his cigarette and puffs out a smoke ring
Sees he still has an audience
Ellie was the only Creed that lived
Then one night a few months later, Ellie freaks out, and she hacks up her grandparents with an axe
(beat) Police found her licking their brains off the blade
They locked her up in a psycho ward and all she said were two words: 'Pet Sematary
Pet Sematary
' Clyde stares at the wide-eyed kids
He grins, takes a swig of beer, and moves in for the kicker
Oh yeah
Almost forgot
Here's the best part
Two nights ago she escapes
Word is, she was heading for Maine
Man  hope she doesn't show up out here
(feigning concern) Shit, we wouldn't even notice her, not if she's wearing a costume
She could be one of us
Clyde casts a suspicious eye on the group
The kids uneasily look at each other, making sure they know who's behind each and every costume
Suddenly Clyde drops his jaw in exaggerated horror
Oh my Goddd
Clyde lifts a trembling finger, pointing beyond the group of spellbound listeners
It's
It's
The kids are afraid to turn around, assuming Clyde's rigged up some unspeakable terror
And for an instant, a look of real horror washes over Clyde's face
Is coming up the path beneath the archway, rising out of the swirling mist
frightening silhouette, backlit by the moon
But then Clyde realizes who it is
Shit
It's Drew's Dad
It's fuckin' Gus
Drew and the others quickly turn around, realizing it's not part of the punch-line scare
89 91 - The kids quickly scramble for hiding places in the bordering brush, dropping their beer cans as fast as they can
As Drew leaps to his feet, he upsets the fire, knocking one of the logs
rolls to the base of one of the brittle old crosses
Drew and Geoff run for it
,  - Gus moves quickly up the meandering path, sending the blinding beam of his flashlight over the graves
You boys better not be drinking
- Through the thick woods, Drew is flanked by Geoff and Clyde
Oh man, he's gonna kick my ass
Drew starts to take off
Clyde trips him on his first stride
Drew hits the dirt
Thanks for fucking up our Halloween, dumbshit
Clyde recedes into the woods as Gus approaches the campfire
He scans the area with his flashlight, illuminating the various beer cans
Drew, you get your ass out here
Front and center
Geoff pulls Drew to his feet
Gus passes the flashlight over the woods
Kids duck away, retreating from their hiding places
The flashlight sweeps toward Drew
Drew freezes, spotlighted by Gus' beam
burst of floods Drew's horrified face
Get out here, Joker
Geoff remains frozen in the woods nearby, out of Gus' light
Behind Gus, the wooden cross is completely on fire now
You out here making a fool of me
Drew shakes his head in instant denial
'm warning you, buddy
You don't play by the rules, 'm gonna shadow your ass for eternity
Drew makes a break from his spot in the woods
He weaves through the markers, arcing around the outer perimeter to avoid Gus
but Gus is quicker
He zigzags through the crosses and headstones to intercept Drew
Gus gets a handful of Drew's collar and yanks him in
You little shit
Gus draws his free arm back and smacks Drew across the face
Drew goes down
is looking on from the woods, horrified
Torn
cowers on the ground, trying to scramble away
Geoff bolts out into the firelight, staring defiantly at Gus in silent accusation
Gus is beyond furious
flashes again
You get out of here, Geoff Matthews
This is between me and my boy
Geoff doesn't move
Gus starts to advance forward
but the  emanating from the woods gives him pause
Everyone turns
is heard in the bushes, and Zowie emerges into the building firelight, flashing his fangs at Gus
His eyes
Gus freezes, studying Zowie
Zowie inches forward, poised for the attack
Call off your dog, Drew
Drew shifts his eyes from Zowie to Gus, too terrified to heed such a command
Zowie brushes past Drew and Geoff, moving in on Gus
Gus' eyes shift to burning cross at his side
With a swift boot, he kicks over the cross and presses it into his grip
Swinging the cross like a primitive weapon, Gus connects with the side of Zowie's head
Zowie spins a full circle from the impact
But he lands on all fours
Unphased
Taking the next step toward Gus
There's something clearly not of this world in Zowie's vicious stare
(terrified) Drew, call him off
All Drew can manage is a faint appeal
Zowie
Zowie goes for Gus, launching into the air
and sinking his glistening fangs into Gus' neck
showers the closest headstone
Gus comes helplessly tumbling down with the weight of the dog
His are suddenly cut short as Zowie rips out his throat
His arms flail weakly at his sides, then grow still
Drew and Geoff stare at the scene, wide-eyed with shock
Zowie looks up from Gus' neck with dripping, red fangs
For a moment, his eyes settle on Drew
Then Zowie bolts off, disappearing into the night
Oh, God
Oh, God
Drew's eyes shift to Geoff, whose face is flushed with sickened fear
(a whisper) Is he dead
In dazed shock, Drew moves in for a closer look at the body
Gus' eyes are wide open
Blood is still pumping in rhythm from his jugular with each weakening beat of his heart
It's a gruesome image against the roaring fire
Drew kneels at Gus' side
He wants to touch him
To shake him awake, but with every attempt, he draws his hand back
Is he breathing
Can you hear him breathing
Drew leans forward, turning his ear toward Gus' gaping mouth
And as he inches closer
' His hand jerks up and closes around Drew's neck
Gus stares up at him with his crazed menace
Drew
His fingers claw at Gus' hand, desperate to pry it loose
but then, Gus' hand relaxes as his last, dying ounce of strength fades away
Drew shrinks back, crouching over the lifeless body as the blazing firelight dances over it
He turns his tear-filled gaze to Geoff
Oh man, Geoff
we killed him
we killed him
(beat) What're we gonna do
Geoff draws closer and looks down into the dead man's face
We could bring him back
Drew's eyes widen at the suggestion
And now,   on Gus' body, and on the boys, We move ever higher, until we are At the  of a shovel cutting into rocky soil, we
: 95 - Three quick shots: sinking into the earth
falling head down into the grave, landing with a heavy
covering Gus' lifeless face
'  - Amanda is pacing back and forth on the porch, checking her watch every few steps
She sighs with relief as
Drew appears from the darkness of the woods
Drew dismounts his bike and carries it up the front porch steps, strangely silent
His clothes and face are caked with dirt
Jesus, Drew, do you know what time it is
Did Gus ever find you
Drew moves on past her into the house
(calling after him) Drew
Drew, what happened
(trying not to lose it) Nothing happened, Mom
We just ditched Gus, that's all
Drew pauses and stares out into the unknown darkness of the night
'  - Chase is in the study, perusing some files
He looks into the hallway as Geoff arrives home, then glances at the clock
It's late
Very late
Chase rises
He's both angry and relieved
Right now, though, the anger's winning out
Were you drinking
Geoff absently shakes his head
He slumps back against the wall, drained from the night's horrors
Drew's Mom called hours ago, the rest of the kids were back by ten
Where the hell were you boys
Geoff shrugs, trying to mask his uneasiness
Just out
"Out
" Well that's great, Geoff
(beat) Look, 've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but 'm not going to stand for crap like this
don't care if it's Halloween
it's a school night, and if you do this again
(cutting him off) 'm really tired, Dad
can  just go to sleep
Chase stops and looks at his son
Geoff's exhaustion is self- evident
(sighing) Go on
we'll talk about this in the morning
Geoff nods and heads for the stairs
'  - is creeping up on 2AM
rumbles outside in the distance and rain starts to spatter the window panes
Geoff's eyelids fall beneath unbearable weight and he nods off to sleep
Tiger is sprawled out on the blanket against his chest
Slowly, we move back towards the window
In a flash of -- ' Washed in the haunting white glow
Streaked with mud
Caked with blood
Staring in at Geoff
Geoff is jolted awake by the delayed clap of  and whips his gaze to the window
Before he can focus
the pulse of lightning fades away
And with it, Gus' face
Only darkness remains beyond the window pane
Geoff returns his gaze to the bedroom, unaware of Gus' appearance
He sinks back to his pillow, already hurtling towards sleep once more
'  - the house,    a rain-obscured window on the ground floor, the window to Drew's bedroom
'  - Drew is sound asleep, curled up under the sheets
He clutches his pillow like a life preserver
(
) Drew
Drew's eyes flutter open
He turns towards the window
Now, he hears some activity outside
And then Gus' hushed voice
(
) Drew, buddy
lost my keys
Drew goes saucer-eyed
He swallows the swelling lump in his throat and rises from his bed
- Drew steadies his quivering fingers just enough to sink the key into the deadbolt on the back door
Drawing the  door open, he gazes out back
(scared shitless) Gus
Nothing moves outside
The longer Drew watches, the more eerie each shadow becomes
Spooked, Drew steps back inside, quickly closing the door
He locks it back up again
When he turns around, he's face to face with
Drew stiffens, backing into the wall
-how'd you get in
Gus offers a nightmarish grin and raises his hand, dangling his keys
Found 'em
Drew's eyes follow a flow of blood from Gus' neck to the floor
Gus looks down at his dirty, bloody footprints
He's tracked blood all over the linoleum
'm makin' a mess of your mother's kitchen floor
(beat) need a shower
Gus turns without another word and heads for the stairs
Drew's mouth drops in utter astonishment as he watches Gus clumsily climbing the stairs
After a moment, he returns his attention to the bloody kitchen floor
Tearing off a wad of paper towels, he wets them and begins to mop up Gus' tracks
103 - Gazing vacantly at his reflection, Gus covers his ravaged throat with a gauze strip, wrapping it around the circumference of his neck again and again and again
Behind him, the shower is running, filling up the bathroom with steam
Finishing the dressing off with a sloppy tape job, Gus reaches for the pajamas hanging nearby
He lazily buttons the buttons, failing to notice their alignment is off
He never did bother to shower
He's still covered with mud
'  - Gus enters from the steamy bathroom
The shower is still running
Amanda stirs, sleepy eyes focusing on him
Gus, hon
'm sorry about tonight
You coming to bed
Gus lifts the covers and climbs in
With him comes the chill of death
Gus presses up behind her
His hand moves beneath the sheets, finding its way over the curve of her waist, caressing
Amanda shivers
God, you're ice cold
(turning) and you smell
Lord, what did you get yourself into
It's then that Amanda sees the bandage around Gus' neck
Blood is seeping through the gauze
My God, Gus, what happened
Amanda reaches out to touch him, but Gus stops her hand short of the bandage
Instead, he leans forward and clutches one of her breasts
Amanda tries to twist away
Gus
stop it
What's wrong with you
But Gus doesn't stop
He throws himself on top of Amanda, roughly forcing her back onto the bed
Gus
Amanda's hands beat at Gus' face and back, to no apparent effect
With one arm forced against Amanda's throat, he rips open her nightgown with the other
We pull away from Amanda's struggles, back to the bathroom
The shower running on and on, cloaking the bedroom in steam
- Geoff is riding along the highway, his backpack full of school books
Drew is waiting on the shoulder ahead
When Geoff approaches, Drew hops on his bike, getting up to speed
- Geoff keeps glancing at Drew, waiting for him to say something
Drew maintains his enigmatic expression
Well
Drew nods
Geoff's eyes widen in disbelief
Picture this
Gus comes down to breakfast and he doesn't say a word
He even kind of smiles, like he forgot he hates me
And then you know what he does
He serves me an extra helping of pancakes
(beat) asked him if  was still grounded
"no
"  asked him if you could spend the night, and he nods
It's like we're a family
real family
The words have their own meaning for Geoff, who stares to the road ahead in deep thought
It's weird
What do you mean
It's like he's not Gus anymore
He's different
You know, like Zowie
They share a chuckle that ends in silent uneasiness
'  - Chase enters with a stack of files tucked under his arm
As he organizes them in the large filing cabinet with the others, he listens to his messages on the answering machine
The current caller sounds a little annoyed
Doctor Matthews, this is Elliot Rudman at the university
've looked over the blood specimen you sent us on canine Zowie
Chase abandons the filing and immediately returns the call
While it
(
) Knock, Knock, Doc
and   are standing in the doorway to Chase's office, trying not to intrude on his call
(quiet whisper) We saw your sign
Are there any kitties left
Chase studies them
They look like decent people
Take your pick
They're in the boarding area
You can go on back
Chase turns away as his phone call is answered
Elliot, it's Chase

'  () - has the phone tucked under his chin, in the midst of an autopsy
The  of the saw drowns out his words as he shaves the dome off a dog's skull
didn't get that
The pathologist turns off the saw
His words become audible
said next time it might help if you took the blood sample while the animal was still alive
The comment hits Chase out of left field
What
don't know what you expected to find, Matthews
There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death
Wait, there must be some mix-up
He was
the dog is alive
Not this dog
There wasn't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea
Chase is baffled, speechless
You took over for Doctor Yolander
Yes
why
Because the last person that sent me blood from a dead animal was Yolander
110 112 - The kennels have been cleaned up, but the room retains its eerie, dimly lit quality
The  of a faucet reverberates from the far corner
The mother enters with a toddler clinging to each hand
Their smiles fade at the unsettling surroundings
Slowly, they move down the row of kennels
Where are the kitties
'  - (into the phone) Look, this is ridiculous
Suddenly, -  pierce the air
Chase drops the phone and rushes out of the office
- The toddlers are screaming at the top of their lungs
Mom is burying their heads in her dress
Chase bursts in as the mother hastily retreats for the exit
Her horrified eyes flash by Chase
In an instant, she and the toddlers are gone
Chase remains alone, moving down the long row of kennels with mounting trepidation
Zowie's cage is empty
Chase shifts his troubled gaze to the
as a    forms on the floor
Chase raises his eyes
'  - Nothing but bloody ribbons of torn flesh are left of the kittens, dangling from the grid gate
Chase looks away as a new level of fear runs through him
Jesus
It's too gruesome even for a man of Chase's background
Fighting the gag reflex, he searches the room for the missing dog
and then he spots the broken glass window vent along the floor
And the pile of blood-spattered shards laying on the tile
,  - Clyde, Stevie, and Brad are loitering near the front bike racks
Clyde's smoking away
As Geoff and Drew come out of the school, the trio moves to intercept them
Hey
Just then, Chase's van pulls at the curb, interrupting whatever trouble was about to happen
Clyde looks from the van to Geoff, and falls back
Saved by the bell
Chase hurriedly rolls down the passenger window as Geoff and Drew approach
Can  sleep over at Drew's tonight
Chase is preoccupied with other concerns
Yeah
that's fine
(beat) Listen, Drew,  got the tests back on Zowie
He's not well
Don't ask me how, but he got out this afternoon
Geoff and Drew exchange concerned looks
If he finds his way home, call me, no matter what the hour, okay
And don't try to approach him
Whatever he's got might be infectious
Understand
The boys nod their heads
Chase masks his anxiety with a weary smile
With a wave, he speeds up, leaving the boys
'  - of Maine is unfolded on the passenger seat
Chase is on the car phone
Can  have the address for Quentin Yolander
Chase jots an address down on the map
He turns the van up a mountain road, winding through the towering pines
'  - remote, rustic dwelling nestled into the desolate backwoods
'  - rocks back in his thick hide chair
His world is closed off from daylight by the extensive blinds
He's holding a   in his lap
Its big brown eyes are staring back at him
You'd be so much more interesting with blue eyes
And now,    '
Yolander's finger comes through from beneath the eye socket
On closer examination,   that the dog is not alive at all
Yolander has his hand inside the hollowed-out carcass
He carefully looks over a container of glass eyes on his desk and selects the right shade of blue
shot of whiskey rests nearby
Yolander reaches up into the poodle's belly and fits the blue eyes securely into place
There's a  at the door
Yolander ignores it
Maybe he's deaf
Another
Yolander turns towards the door, annoyed at the intrusion
And behind that annoyance, there's a touch of madness
, we see the rest of the room
Stuffed animals are crowded from floor to ceiling
product of Yolander's obsession with
'm immortalizing a poodle
State your business
Yolander presses some stuffing into the poodle's gut and begins to sew up the stomach
(
) Doctor Yolander
This is Chase Matthews
've moved into your offices in Ludlow
Yolander's attention remains on the needle as he meticulously stitches the belly
(
) (continuing) sent a blood sample out for analysis
They tell me  sent them the blood of a dead animal
At this, Yolander breaks his concentration
The needle pricks his hand
Blood oozes from the puncture, dripping onto the dog's stomach
(
) a dog
Yolander rises from his seat and swings open the door
Chase stands in the doorway, startled
It doesn't take a genius to figure out that the good Doctor is drunk
(glaring) Why are you bothering me about this
Can't you leave it be
um
Chase glances to the right and steps back
is perched nearby, frozen in mid-pounce
It takes a second for Chase to register that the bobcat has been stuffed
Now Chase sees the rest of the room
a whole zoo of stuffed animals, looking like a rural version of the Bates Motel
(momentarily thrown) the pathologist
he said that you had reported a similar incident
with a cat
The Creed cat, that's right
Bastard's name was "Church"
(grins) Let me guess
Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating
maybe you can't find a heartbeat
Exactly
thought it might be some sort of blood condition
immune deficiency or
Quentin Yolander laughs
It's disconcerting
There's no "blood condition
" The dog isn't sick, it's dead
(drawing closer) And so was Creed's cat
And so was his wife the night she was killed for the second time
As Yolander moves forward, Chase backs up
He bumps into a whole shelf of stuffed creatures
To his right,   sits frozen on its perch
Chase regards Yolander as being completely insane
(menacing) You want some advice, friend
You get in your car, you pick up your family
and you get the hell out of that town
Well
uh
thanks
Chase continues to back out of the door
On his way out, he bumps into the stuffed raven's perch
only this raven isn't stuffed
It spreads its wings and Chase just about jumps out of his skin, tripping out of the doorway
116D 116F '  - Gus reaches into the cage and grabs a rabbit by the ears
He casually snaps the neck
Laying the limp carcass on a stump cutting board, he quickly skins it
Hanging above the cages, there is now a line of furry pelts
Half a dozen
Drew and Geoff are on the porch, looking on
guess we're having rabbit for dinner
Gus hangs the freshly skinned fur to dry and violently snatches another hare from the cage
'  - The dinner from Hell
Geoff splats a helping of mashed potatoes onto his plate, all the while keeping a wary eye on Gus
Gus is serving himself a chunk of rabbit
It hits the edge of the plate, teetering on the rim
He passes the dish on
Gus meets Geoff's gaze
For a moment, there's a deadened, vacant look in Gus' eyes
Then slowly, a limp smile creeps over him, sending a chill up Geoff's spine
Geoff averts Gus' stare
Gus helps himself to potatoes and passes the plate on
He lets go of it short of reaching Drew
Only Drew's quick hands save it from hitting the table
Amanda comes to the table with a dish of
She casts Gus a cold, hateful stare and sets the limas down
She's still angry over last night
Gus dishes a sloppy scoop and passes it toward Drew
Like before, he lets it drop too early
This time Drew doesn't save it
The lima beans shower the floor
God damnit, Gus
This isn't funny
Amanda fetches a dishtowel and kneels to clean up the mess
Geoff and Drew exchange quick glances
As Geoff reaches for the salt
Gus intercepts his wrist
Geoff gulps
Gus drops his jaw, revealing a gooey mass of food
But the frozen smile and the look in his eyes convey dementia rather than playfulness
Geoff and Drew can't believe their eyes
They laugh uncomfortably
There's no other response
Gus  too
awkward, terrible laughter
Spitting out food over his shirt and plate as he does so
The boys stop laughing, but Gus just keeps on going
Amanda stares at Gus and carries the mess out of the room
Through his laughter, Gus' bandage has slipped down, exposing part of his ragged wound
The wound glistens, oozing   and Drew hesitantly reaches for Gus' neck, readjusting the bandage
Grossed out, Geoff averts his eyes and sets his fork aside
'  - Geoff and Drew enter
Drew swiftly secures the deadbolts on his door
What was that all about
You think he's trying to scare us
don't know but 'm not taking any chances
Drew opens the chest at the foot of his bed and produces a box full of shells spill as he withdraws the gun
Cracking open the chamber, Drew loads two shells into the chamber
- moonlit horizon
Unmoving
Silent
The kind of silence that pulls at the darkest recesses of imagination
And now,    appears on the horizon
It's Zowie, moving at a deliberate pace
Zowie takes pause
The  of his collar tags resumes as he drops over the horizon line, cutting down the hill
'  - Chase sits in the den, looking exhausted and disheveled
In front of him, the t
v
is on
'  stares out at us
Chase hits the remote and rises, moving to the back door
He checks the deadbolt, then secures the chain link as a backup
From somewhere outside, we hear a
Chase's eyes drop to the  , a holdover from the previous owner
Chase bends down and latches the door
Now he pauses at his desk
considers
then pulls something out of the bottom drawer
It's a gun
- Chase moves to the front of the house, securing that door
Satisfied, he turns off the light and heads upstairs
- , shadow and form begin to take shape
We hear a low  and see a flash of
It's Zowie
Already in the house
123 '  - Coming through the door from the downstairs, Chase stops cold
is on the bed
Clothed in a negligee
Lying across a blanket of rose petals
Her eyes meet his with powerful longing
Chase
miss you so much
(dry-mouthed) Renee
Chase approaches
Slowly
Fearful that this is all a dream
Renee reaches out her hand
They touch
This is not a dream
Oh God
Chase absently sets his gun on the bedside table as Renee draws his body to hers
They kiss
Once
Twice
Not a dream
Renee rolls Chase over, forcefully climbing on top
Chase sinks down into the center of the bed as Renee straddles him
Slowly, Renee slips off the top of her negligee
(a whisper) can come back, Chase
and sinks down on top of him, kissing him hungrily
Her nipples graze his chest, then her breasts flatten as she grinds her hips against his
Almost instantly, the weight of her grows unbearable
Chase fights to pull his mouth from hers, to breathe
No
Too heavy
There is no pleasure in his words, just unmitigated horror as Renee's body comes down on him harder
can't breathe
can't
' pop open, frenzied,
Chase is alone on the bed, but he's still feeling the weight pressing down on him
is laying on his chest, staring back at him, rearing his teeth in a growl
Zowie  forward, jaws flashing, and Chase twists sideways
connect with Chase's shoulder, then with the pillows where Chase's head used to be Chase scrambles out of bed, flailing for the gun on the bedside table
spins out of reach and across the floor
Chase  for the gun and reaches it just as Zowie leaps to the floor
In a panic, Chase
Zowie abruptly turns and  through the bedroom window, sending glass flying
- Zowie slides down the room and leaps to the ground below, disappearing into the night
'  - Chase looks on in terror
Finally he pulls his eyes away from the shattered window
and catches a glimpse of something in the dresser mirror
Something that sends a chill up his spine
The flurry of down feathers is floating to the mattress
But intermingling with the feathers are a handful of  , slowly settling to the bed
- Chase is bare-chested at the mirror, applying a dressing to the dog bite on his shoulder
Marjorie appears in the doorway with a basket of laundry
She stops short at the sight of Chase standing there in his boxers
Chase catches her reflection in the mirror and is startled
didn't mean to
was going to empty the hamper
Chase turns, shaking off the scare
It's okay
Marjorie's eyes can't help but fix on the dog bites scattered over Chase's chest and arms
What happened to you
had a little run-in with Zowie
You sure did
Marjorie sets the laundry aside
Here, let me do that
Marjorie looks over the antiseptics Chase has laid out on the sink
Saturating a wad of gauze with hydrogen peroxide, she gently cleanses the gashes on his arms
There's nothing overtly sexual in her actions, but the gentleness of her touch doesn't go unnoticed by Chase
hope he doesn't have rabies
He doesn't
don't know what he has, but 'm hoping to God it's not infectious
Chase stops and looks at Marjorie's reflection in the mirror
Marjorie
what do you know about the Creed murders
Marjorie stiffens for a moment
Obviously the Creeds are a sore spot for the people in this town
Did you ever play that game where you pass a story down a row of people and see how screwed up it gets by the time it's done
People say Louis Creed's son came back from the dead and it drove him crazy
(she rolls her eyes) He killed his wife and himself, and that's the end of story
Anything else belongs in the National Enquirer
Marjorie tapes the bandage over Chase's shoulder too tight
Chase's groan snaps her back to the reality at hand
Sorry
Now tell me what that has to do with Zowie
Chase closes his eyes, shutting out the pain
wish  knew
- Chase approaches the counter, looking to the   for assistance
What are you looking for, Hon
Do you have anything on the Creed murders
can't find the microfilm from that period
The librarian's smile vanishes
She lowers her voice, focusing her attention on some paperwork
We don't keep anything on file from that far back
But you've got files from the previous years
We have nothing on the Creed murders, sir
Can  get you something else
Chase looks around and realizes that a dozen hostile eyes are on him
withholding a dark secret
Chase slowly backs away, eager to escape the field of hostile stares
127 129 ,   - Geoff and Drew have parked their bikes beneath the bridge
They sit on the bank of the creek below, watching the water run past
Geoff is lost in thought
Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus
don't know
(thinking) maybe it depends on what you were like before you
(finishing) Dies
Drew nods
He tosses a stone into the creek, then looks up at the sun and sighs
gotta go back and do my chores
Go later
Drew shakes his head
can't
Gus'd kill me if showed up late
The boys reluctantly rise and move to their bikes, walking them up the steep grade to the highway
See you at school Monday
Geoff nods
He looks at Drew
The boy is genuinely frightened
But there's nothing either of them can do
They're trapped in their roles as kids
Both boys mount their bikes
Drew turns
You ever think about running away
All the time
Drew smiles at this
He waves to Geoff and pedals off
(calling back) See ya
Geoff waves and heads off in the opposite direction
- As he moves down the road
Up ahead, we hear the approaching of a motorcycle
rips by on an old junkyard fixer-up , and he's heading in Geoff's direction
Seeing him, Drew brakes and pulls his bike into a -turn, pumping furiously to catch up with Geoff
- Now Geoff hears the  of Clyde's motorcycle
He glances back
Clyde's spotted him,  the engine
Geoff pedals like mad, but it's no use
Clyde is closing in on him, grinning sadistically
Clyde sweeps in next to him, calling out over the
Well look who's here
Clyde veers right, forcing Geoff towards the shoulder of the road
131 132 - The ground ahead drops toward a ravine
Geoff has nowhere to go but down the slope
Clyde is right there beside him
Laughing, Clyde reaches over and grabs ahold of Geoff's handlebar
He jerks it sideways
Oops
Geoff's front wheel turns perpendicular
The bike pitches forward, Geoff into the dirt ahead
Clyde broadies his bike to a stop
With the engine idling, he hops off
Before Geoff can get to his feet, Clyde has picked up Geoff's bike and planted it upside down in the dirt
Guess your Dad's not here to save you now, is he
Clyde gets a handful of Geoff's collar and drags him over toward the bike
With his free hand, Clyde cranks the pedal
The back wheel spins
Faster and faster
You ever seen a tire take off a nose
Through the blur of the spokes,   Geoff, eyes widening fearfully
Neither have
Clyde forces Geoff's face toward the spinning tread
Might even kill ya
Wheel might chew right into your brains
You could visit your mom
Geoff tries to get a hold on the frame of the bike for leverage, but his arms don't reach beyond the spinning wheel
Clyde is full of deranged glee, fueled by Geoff's fear
But now,   grabs the wool scarf streaming from the back of Clyde's neck and yanks him off of Geoff
Clyde reels, finding
standing there behind him
He looks bad
Real bad
His bandages are unwound and his ruined neck is still seeping
His face is unearthly pale
He's deteriorated considerably since yesterday
(startled) Jesus Christ, Gus
Gus levels a threatening gaze at Geoff
Go home
But Geoff remains frozen
Gus fixes him with a stare that could turn flesh to stone
said
Geoff snaps out of it and flips his bike over
He gets a running start, making a beeline for the highway without ever looking back
Drew stops short of the ravine, watching from afar as Gus steps toward Clyde
- Clyde throws up his hands
He's frightened, but he tries to muster up a cocky front
Come on, Gus,  was just fucking with him
(nervous laughter) What're you gonna do
Give me a ticket
mean, shit, Gus
Clyde grows increasingly wary of Gus' evil stare
Gus steps closer
You can't lay a finger on me
Wrong
Gus lashes out, backhanding Clyde across the face
Clyde falls to the ground, flat on his back, with his nose gushing blood
Terrified
Gus turns around and lifts the idling motorcycle
With one hand under the back of the seat, and the other working the accelerator handlebar, Gus advances toward Clyde
Gus kicks the bike into gear and  the accelerator
On the pavement it would be moving forty miles an hour
Clyde can't believe his eyes
Pleading
Gus
what are you doing
'm just fucking with you
Gus plants his foot against Clyde's chest, pinning him, and lowers the spinning rear wheel  '
The wheel  like a circular saw
Gus lowers the wheel
Then jerks it away, flashing a sadistic smile
Just when Clyde thinks Gus is backing off, the wheel comes down again
(wailing) Stop it, man
Stop it
Gus gets into the rhythm as he lowers and retracts the spinning wheel at the terrified bully
But this time, as the wheel comes down
'  , defying gravity, gets swept up, swallowed into the
And along with the scarf, here comes Clyde's  face
We can only imagine the gruesome instant that follows
sprays up over Gus' arms and chest
And then we hear the sound of   jamming the motorcycle's gears
(dead-pan) Whoops
He bares his teeth in a death's head grin
Drew has witnessed the killing
He's mortified
- Gus tosses the bloody motorcycle aside, slowly raising his eyes up to where Drew stands
His eyes meet Drew's
Drew hastily jerks his bike around and takes off
Gus starts after him on foot
'  - Drew rushes through the front door,  it behind him and throwing the deadbolt
- Drew climbs onto his bed and grabs his shotgun from the gun rack
His fingers shake as he flips off the safety
Oh man
Just then we hear the  of a
and Gus' amplified coming from the yard outside
(
) (mocking) This is the Police, come out of the house with your hands up
Gus finishes his words with a burst of  and then amplified Drew's eyes go wide with terror
He creeps out into the hall, clutching the gun
- Drew tries to look out the window
Then we hear a low, guttural Drew slowly turns
Zowie is standing down the hall, leveling a dead stare
Zowie takes the first step forward
(horrified) No, Zowie
It's me
Pleading, Drew slowly retreats down the hallway
Along the way, he backs right into
, grinning from ear to ear
Drew recoils against the wall, swinging up his shotgun
Stay back
But Gus just keeps on grinning
He takes a step forward
Drew pulls the trigger
And
Nothing happens
The chambers are empty
Forget something, Drew buddy
Gus raises his hand
He's holding the shotgun shells
He lets them fall to the floor
Suddenly Gus wrenches the gun from Drew's hands
He swings it and
Drew  and ducks beneath the blow, as the shotgun butt a hole in the wall above his head
Gus flings the shotgun aside and  for Drew
Drew races down the hallway to the back door
He turns the latch
The deadbolt has been locked from the inside
Drew's eyes whip to the keyholder on the wall
All the keyhooks are empty
Here comes the  of keys in Gus' pockets as he comes down the hall
Drew dashes away from the back door
Gus' eyes shift from Drew's fleeing form to     in the service closet
Drew jimmies the knob
Again, the deadbolt is locked from the inside
Tears are streaming down Drew's face now
approach
Drew spins around
Gus is advancing,    tight in his grip
(crazed) You have the right to remain silent
Gus  the hammer into the wall to punctuate his words
Plaster goes flying
(continuing) while  bash your fucking head in
Drew's eyes dart frantically, looking for a way out
The closest route of escape is
Down the hallway, Zowie starts running forward
Drew's caught between a rock and a hard place
You have the right to a lawyer, but you won't need one
He runs for it
Gus charges to intercept him
Drew gets to the stairs first
cause you'll be dead
Gus brings the hammer down with the claw end leading
It sinks into the stair below Drew's feet
Zowie  past Gus, tearing up the stairs as Gus wrenches the hammer free
Drew makes it to the top of the stairs with Zowie right on his heels
Drew  into Amanda and Gus' bedroom as
Zowie springs from the floor
Drew  the door shut, Zowie
Zowie collapses to the floor, dazed
- Drew throws the latch on the door
Almost immediately, Gus is outside,  at the door with the claw end of the hammer
Wood splinters fly as the hammer claw sinks through
Drew  and goes for one of the dormer windows
It's stuck; he can't get it open
From the hallway, Gus violently  the door again and again
The door is splintering apart
glimpses of Gus through the ragged holes
(
) Do you understand these rights, Drew buddy
Drew grabs a chair and  it through the window
(
) The bedroom door   and Gus claws his way into the room
Wasting no time, Drew climbs through the broken window
'  - Drew slides down the slant of the roof
He hits the lattice and takes it to the ground with him
Untangling himself, he gets to his feet
and here comes Amanda,
Drew runs for her car, waving his hands, throwing himself into her path so she'll go no further
She  on the brakes
Drew pulls open the passenger door and dives inside
Gus killed Clyde, Mom
He's trying to kill me
Just then, the   flies open
Gus steps out
Drew, buddy
Daddy's not done yet
Amanda spots the hammer hanging from his grip
Gus cracks a sick smile and    at the car
The hammer bounces off the windshield, causing it to spiderweb
Go Mom
Go
That's all the convincing Amanda needs
She puts the car into reverse and stomps on the gas
- Speeding down the highway
Drew and Amanda are mortified
Suddenly, we hear the  of Gus' patrol car coming up from behind
Amanda looks to the rear-view mirror
- Approaching from the road ahead is a
'  - Amanda hips her head back in front of them
The potato truck is blaring its
Gus' car swerves out onto the shoulder, speeding up to match her pace
Mom
Gus cranks the wheel, jumping back onto the road, forcing Amanda's car into the path of the oncoming truck
- stands on the
- '
Thousands of potatoes explode from the rear of the truck, obscuring our view
Gus' vehicle speeds past
on the mess of twisted steel
Clearly there are no survivors
'  - Geoff enters first
Wearing a dark suit
Looking pale and empty inside
Chase follows, dressed in black
It's obvious they've been to a funeral
Without a word, Geoff heads up the stairs
Chase watches on, feeling utterly helpless
- Chase exits from his bedroom, pulling a sweater over a more casual change of clothes
He cocks his head at the  of Geoff moving about in the attic above
The door atop the attic stairway is barely ajar
Chase wrinkles his brow, concerned
Turning away, he heads downstairs
- Marjorie is preparing dinner
Across the room, the kitchen  is playing
is the evening news
photo of Drew and Amanda appears above the
Friends and neighbors came to pay respects for Drew and Amanda Gilbert, who died in a head-on collision Saturday
Chase enters the kitchen, eyes moving to the
Those poor people
saw Gus this morning
he looked terrible
Chase pulls his eyes away from the broadcast as Marjorie sets dinner on the table
Chase yells upstairs
Geoff, dinner's ready
(after no reply) Geoff
(
) 'm not hungry
Chase gives Marjorie an apologetic look and rises from the table
Meanwhile, the news broadcast continues
photo of Clyde appears on the screen
in other news, the disappearance of a Ludlow youth remains a mystery
Clyde Parker was last seen on Saturday afternoon
His motorcycle was found off Highway 62
150 - Chase pushes open the door
spring coil pulls the  door closed behind him
One look at the attic and Chase turns pale
huge window at the far end of the room allows the moonlight to reach all corners of the spacious old attic
All of Renee's belongings have been unpacked
The entire attic has been converted into a museum-like room, down to the last meticulous detail
room in preparation for Renee's return
Gauzy curtains billow out from some unseen draft
Pictures of Renee rest everywhere
Awards
Memorabilia
is seated before the brightly lit, three-way theatrical mirror, casually setting out Renee's make-up
Geoff
what are you doing
There's an obsessive dementia in Geoff's gaze
'm getting things ready for Mom
Chase sighs
Obviously the strain of Drew's funeral has proven too much for Geoff
He moves closer
(gently) Mom is dead, Geoff
You know that
creepy smile flickers across Geoff's face
She doesn't have to be
Chase freezes as a chill runs up his spine
What are you talking about
can bring her back
The same way Drew and me brought Zowie back
At this, Chase is positively spooked
Geoff, this is crazy
Zowie didn't die
He did
We buried him
(intense) There's a place out in the woods
if you bury something there, it comes back alive
Chase stares at his son
This is insane
It must be
Just then, the   downstairs
Geoff continues to stare at his father
We tried it on Zowie first
And then we did it again, when Zowie killed Gus
Drew didn't want Gus to be dead, so we brought him back, too
It's too much for Chase
His mouth is hanging agape
(
) (outside the attic door) Doctor Matthews, you've got a call
It's the caretaker at the funeral home
Something about your wife's grave
Chase nods in private acknowledgement
He stares at Geoff as he backs away
Look, Geoff
Just
just relax, okay
'm going to take this call and 'll be right back
Okay
Geoff doesn't respond
Chase pulls open the door and leaves
- Chase is on the phone
The '  bring grave concern to Chase
What
Christ, 'll be right there
Chase hangs up, stunned
He turns to Marjorie, who's watching him with a concerned gaze
(hurried) Marjorie,  need you to stay late
Geoff is really upset and  have to take care of this
Don't let him leave the house, alright
Chase is out the door before she has a chance to respond
151B 151F - Geoff is laying on his mother's bed, weeping
Tiger sits at the foot of the bed
Suddenly she wakens and
From out of the darkness
' , gently touching Geoff's side
And with its arrival, so comes her eerie
(a whisper) need you, Geoff
slowly raises his head, bewildered
Renee's hand withdraws into the darkness
He reaches out for her, but she's gone
The remains, beckoning from down the attic stairs
The attic door slowly swings open of its own accord
Geoff rises from the bed and follows
- Geoff looks into the living room as he passes
Marjorie has fallen asleep on the sofa with the  on
155 - The lullaby drifts from beyond the deadfall
The fog rolls inward, towards the distant burial ground
As Geoff moves towards the deadfall, the fog converges around him
157 - The lure of Renee's lullaby pulls Geoff deeper into the woods
We hear the unearthly   once more
159 167 - Chase's van pulls to a stop behind a maintenance vehicle
Chase is greeted by the limping , who quickly leads him off across the rolling hillside
sorry to disturb you, Doctor Matthews, but  thought you'd want to come have a look for yourself
It's the damndest thing
'  - Chase stops cold, gazing at the ground before him in disbelief
The grave is a gaping cavity
The casket has been unearthed
Renee's body is missing
Jesus
(uncomprehending) Gus did this
(nodding) He stuck around after the funeral
Told me he had an order to exhume your wife
didn't think much of it until  saw him drag the body out of the coffin
(shakes his head) He put your wife in his truck and drove off right through Amanda and Drew's headstones
The caretaker points across the hillside
cut through the manicured grass, cutting a path of destruction right through the field of headstones and on through the fence
swear, nothing this weird has happened since Louis Creed dug up his boy
(beat) You want me to notify the authorities
Chase doesn't answer, he just storms past the caretaker
- The van is speeding down the dark, open highway
Chase is on the car phone, frantic, waiting as it
There's finally an answer
Doctor Yolander, this is Chase Matthews, we spoke the other day
Yolander cuts him off
' (bitter) You didn't leave town, did you
'  () Yolander sits in the darkness, a bottle of whiskey and a tumbler at his side
His "creatures" are all around him, eyes glowing with reflected moonlight
His voice is slurred
The voice of someone who's already damned
You sorry bastard
You stayed have nothing more to say to you, Matthews
' (desperate) Look, just tell me one thing
Did treat an animal that had been brought back to life
Did
What do you think
'  - Chase grips the carphone tightly, his knuckles white
(
) Believe what you saw, Matthews
The dog was dead
My God
(mounting horror) how is that possible
You have to help me, Doctor Yolander don't know what 'm dealing with here
They've dug up my wife
' (cutting him off) 'm retired from my practice, Matthews
It's your practice now, and it's your problem
(beat) God help you
(screaming) Wait
Don't hang up
But Yolander does
And now we hear the
Shit
Chase flings the carphone down, looking up as
An approaching potato truck  by
Blinding headlights Chase barely swerves out of the way
Recovering from the scare, Chase reaches over and opens the glove compartment
He pulls out his gun and sets it on the seat next to him
Geoff climbs the stone steps, reaching the flattop meas
He stops short, looking over the clearing
is standing in the center of the burial ground
He's , mimicking Renee's feminine tone
Now he stops and slowly turns, regarding Geoff with dead eyes
He's holding a pickaxe and shovel at his side
Gus looks to the ground at his side
Geoff follows his gaze
'   - Headstone
Manicured grass
Thriving flowers
As if it had been uprooted from her resting place at Pleasantville and set down right in the middle of the Micmac ground
And now, the vision of Renee's grave fades away
In its place is a bundle of white: '
Gus raises the pickaxe, offering it to Geoff
You bury your own, Geoff
Geoff slowly nods and approaches, seduced beyond reason
169 177 ' ,   - Marjorie stirs on the couch, blinking her eyes open at the of a  upstairs
Otherwise, the house is dark and silent
Geoff
- Marjorie starts up the long, dark flight of stairs to the attic
The thin night-shirt she's wearing does little to protect her from the sudden cold
She clutches herself, shivering
Geoff
You okay up there
- Marjorie cautiously pushes open the door
Her concern for Geoff is forgotten as she beholds the Renee Hallow memorabilia
She moves about Renee's unpacked belongings in bewildered reverence
The gauzy curtains billow about Marjorie like ghosts
And then she glimpses something beyond the curtains
stands in the shadows, wearing the    that Marjorie had admired earlier
For a moment we think it's Renee, but as Marjorie draws closer, we see that the dress has been fitted onto a dressmaker's model
Marjorie lays a hand on the fabric, feeling the contours of the design
'  - Chase's headlights sweep across the front of the dark house
Pulling to a stop, Chase opens the van's door
out of the darkness, sinking his teeth into Chase's shoulder
Chase is thrown back over the car seat, grappling with the nightmare dog as it tears into him again and again
Chase , reaching back for the gun
He grabs hold of it and swings it around
Zowie is  backwards, clear out of the car, spraying with
Zowie lands outside on his feet, looking stunned
His chest is a ruined mess
Zowie  and drags himself weakly towards the front porch
Chase stumbles out of the van, clutching the gun
He's bleeding profusely
179 - An old saw is laying in a pile of sawdust next to a square hole that's been cut in the base of the front door
Chase gives it a look as he tries the door
It's unlocked
Chase enters, bringing with him an illuminating swath from his headlights
'  - Chase's headlights stream through the windows, distorting the interior
The house looks like it's been through a tornado trail of    leads into the kitchen
The stench is repulsive
Grimacing, Chase has to keep himself from gagging
Jesus
As Chase moves forward, he catches sight of
standing in a swath of light
At Gus' feet is Zowie, tongue lolling out of his mouth
Dead for the second time
Scattered around the dog are various tools
Propped against the wall is the cut out square of wood
It's fitted with hinges at the top
Gus, what are you doing
Gus glances down at the dead dog
(dead-pan) was building a doggy door
God damn it Gus, you dug up my wife
What the fuck is going on around here
Gus brings a cordless electric drill up from his side, pointing it at Chase in a threatening manner
(grins) little drilling
little killing
As Gus moves forward, Chase gets a good look at him for the first time
He doesn't look even remotely alive
Holy shit
Chase levels his gun with a trembling hand
Gus stabs the air with the drill, feeding on Chase's horror
Chase pulls the trigger
bullet pounds Gus' chest explodes from his back
Unphased, Gus regains his balance
God  hate when that happens
Before Chase can squeeze off the next round, Gus rips the gun from his grip
You got a permit for that
Opening the chamber, Gus empties the remaining bullets and tosses the gun aside
Didn't think so
Gus fires up the drill
The bit spinZZZZZZ
He  at Chase, knocking him back against the counter
The drill bit '
Chase  as Gus withdraws it
Now, he presses it into Chase's shoulder
Chase is on the verge of blacking out now
The pain is unbearable
Gus withdraws the drill once again, aiming now for Chase's eye
(maniacal) No brain, no pain, Chase
Think about it
The whirling drill bit is millimeters away from Chase's eye
He clutches Gus' arm, trying to force the drill aside
At the last second, adrenaline kicks in and Chase diverts the drill
It   the counter-top nearby
Gus , lashing out, but Chase manages to duck away
Chase catches sight of   on the floor
He scrambles for it, scooping it up
are rolling across the floor every which way
Chase slaps his palm down on one and desperately fumbles with the chamber
Gus' hands   around Chase's neck
He swings Chase around and  him against the wall, lifting him off his feet
Chase  as the life is literally crushed out of him
He brings the gun up beneath Gus' chin and jams it into his ruined throat
Gus just keeps on throttling him
(insane) Just remember, Chase
had Renee first
and now 'm gonna have her last
The top of Gus' head  off
His  is thrown back by the incredible force, tumbling him to the kitchen floor with a Chase sucks in precious air, then his head snaps up
Geoff
'  - Chase stumbles from the house
It's a wonder he's even conscious
He swings open the van door and throws himself inside, sinking the key into the ignition
- Marjorie is now seated before Renee's theatrical make-up mirror, entranced
She's wearing the beaded peach dress
With the help of Renee's vast array of cosmetics, Marjorie has turned herself into a stunning beauty
The lipstick isn't quite right
Turning to the countertop magnifying mirror, she carefully touches up her ruby red lips
Her face fills nearly the entire mirror
except for one rim, which reflects the dark, shadowy attic behind her
joins her reflection in the distorting mirror
Marjorie nearly jumps out of her skin
She spins around
Jesus, Geoff
Don't sneak up on me like that
but no one is there
-  catches another glimpse
Renee's  , magnified tenfold
The lips begin to move
(a whisper) Did you really think you could be like me
Renee's fist swings in,  a panel of the mirror
Marjorie raises her hands to protect herself against the flying glass
And as her hands come down, she finds
Renee standing before her
Her ghostly form silhouetted by moonlight
Curtains billowing around her
We never fully see her
Marjorie's face goes white with fear
Such a young face
but you've got potential
Renee grabs a fistful of Marjorie's hair, viciously  her head back
We'll do the eyes first
You always start with the eyes
Renee lashes out,  a mirror shard across the skin beneath Marjorie's right eye
Marjorie
'  - Geoff awakens at the commotion upstairs
He rocks forward, rising from his bed
185 - Geoff pauses at the base of the attic stairway, looking up at the open door
All he hears are the faint  of movement
Marjorie
You know you're not supposed to be in the attic
Geoff starts up the stairs
- Geoff trepidatiously enters
He weaves through the maze of gauzy curtains
And then he sees her
Renee is standing in the midst of the attic
She's perfectly made up
Gorgeous
Just as she was on the day she died
She smiles warmly
Mom
came back for you, Geoff
We're going to be together again
Renee raises her outstretched arms to receive him
Through the haze of his tears, Geoff doesn't see the sinister, vacant gleam in her eyes
'  - Reaching the house, Chase  to a stop across the lawn
188B - Chase cautiously enters with the gun in his grasp
The spring coil swings the  door shut behind him
From Chase's vantage point, he can't see them yet
He makes his way around the stripped dressmaker's model, past an upright dressing mirror
And then he sees
Slumped against Renee's bed like a ragdoll
We can only see half of her face
It looks untouched
Chase reaches for her
Marjorie
Marjorie's head rolls sideways, exposing the other half of her face
The skin has been stripped from her skull and peeled back
Chase turns his head away
And that's when he sees them
Holding each other tightly
Geoff has his head buried in Renee's breast
Renee looks up from her son, meeting Chase's gaze
Her voice is both seductive and terrifying
Hello, Chase
Chase gasps
The word "horror" doesn't do the moment justice
Oh my God
We can try again, Chase
We can make it work this time
Chase sinks back against the wall
He's lost a lot of blood and his strength is leaving him
(shaking his head) No
Don't you love me anymore, Chase
You're not Renee
Renee's dead
(screaming) Geoff
Get over here now
But Geoff just holds his mother tighter
hint of annoyance flickers through Renee's eyes
She strokes Geoff's hair
(looking at Chase) Geoff, honey, why don't you go downstairs
Your father and need a moment alone
Do it for me
Geoff looks up at his mother, mesmerized
She releases him from the embrace
He brushes past Chase without a glance and heads for the attic door
Geoff
Geoff pauses at the door, looking back
Renee's words have a hauntingly familiar ring
love you
Geoff smiles
Turning away, he opens the door and
is standing there, an  perched on his shoulder
His face is torn to shit, bones and brain matter exposed
He's covered from head to toe in dirt and clotted blood
He looks worse than any of the undead we've seen
total walking nightmare
(grinning) Hey, Junior
Wanna play
Clyde swings the axe, sinking it into the wall just in front of Geoff's face
Geoff tumbles back onto the floor, snapping out of his trance
Clyde brings the axe down
and Geoff rolls to the side, barely avoiding decapitation
Geoff
Chase stumbles forward to rescue his son
As he does so, Clyde brings the axe back up,  Chase in the head with the blunt end
Chase goes down
Unconscious
Oops
Looks like Daddy got a boo- boo
Clyde turns his gaze back on Geoff
Now, where were we
Geoff shuffles backwards across the floor as Clyde moves into the room
Renee passes behind Clyde
She  the attic door shut and snaps off the knob with a jerk of the wrist, locking them all inside
Scared out of his wits, Geoff makes it to his feet
Clyde swings again and misses
Geoff grabs hold of the axe handle, struggling, and the two boys go down
Moves to the vanity
She sweeps a hand across it, sending everything crashing to the ground
Crystal perfume bottles , spilling their contents over the floor
Renee reaches for a lighter and flicks it on
She touches the flame to the perfume-soaked floor
roar into existence, racing across the floorboards, igniting the curtains
We see the flames reflected in Renee's soulless eyes
As they wrestle with one another across the floor
Bloody spittle drips from Clyde's face
He flashes a feral snarl
Clyde  forward and tears into Geoff's shoulder with his teeth
Geoff
His hands grope blindly for a weapon and close on a mirror shard
He  it up and into Clyde's eye
Somehow, Geoff manages to roll out from under Clyde
He rises to his feet
Clyde lets loose a
He charges,  the axe wildly, knocking aside curtains and dressing models alike
Nothing's going to stop him
Nothing
Flames are consuming the attic, licking the rafters, igniting the canopy drapings
devouring everything
is rolling across the floor
Geoff reaches a far wall
He's trapped in a corner
There's nowhere else to go
Behind Geoff is a run from the box down through the attic floor
Geoff turns
And here comes Clyde
Here it comes, buddy Clyde swings
Geoff ducks
The axe hits the circuit box behind him, severing the insulated cables
As Clyde rips the axe out of the wall for another try, Geoff reaches for one of the
Clyde raises the axe above his head
Eat it, ass-hole
and Geoff shoves the live cable into Clyde's mouth
shoot out of Clyde's eyes and ears
He jerks back and forth, writhing in a horrific replay of Renee's electrocution
Then Clyde's face   in a gout of ruined flesh and The circuit is blown and the   falls
Geoff drops the cable
The blazing inferno is closing in
He runs to Chase
Chase is barely conscious
Geoff drops to his knees and pulls his father to his feet
(
) Don't leave me again, Geoff
Geoff turns
is standing in the midst of the , reaching out
The make-up and mortician's wax she wears fall victim to the heat and her "face" begins to
Don't leave me alone
Geoff turns away, horrified
With Chase on his shoulder, he reaches the door
Locked
Geoff sets Chase against the wall
He spots the , still clutched in Clyde's hand
Geoff drags the axe free from the dead boy's grasp and goes to work on the door
Ignoring Renee's , Geoff swings the axe again and again, chopping the door apart
He coughs through the smoke
The flames are almost upon them
Finally, the wood splinters apart
Geoff reaches through and grasps the outside handle, pulling the door open
Then he turns and lifts Chase up once more
At the door, Geoff pauses for one final, tearful look back
Then his face hardens and he turns away, pulling Chase to safety
,
Alone in the fiery storm,
Flames devour her flowing white dress
Her face doesn't even look remotely human anymore
And as the inferno slowly closes in, we
: - We   from a sign on the door that says ""
Chase is just now locking up the door
He's bandaged up, looking a little worse for the wear, but happy to be alive
He turns, grinning
stands near the van, holding Tiger in his arms
All set
All set
Chase joins Geoff at the van and together they climb inside
Chase starts the engine, pulling away from the office
- As it moves off down the street, passing the familiar landmarks of sleepy Ludlow
- We follow the van as it sweeps out of town
Ludlow looks picture- perfect from our bird's eye vantage point
Charming and quiet
(
) So where're we going
Anywhere but here
We continue rising up into the brilliant blue sky, losing the van amidst the rolling Maine countryside and we : - over the woods, just above the tree tops
It's an ocean of swaying green beneath us
forest as ancient and mysterious as anything on the Earth
- The endless trees fall out from under us
We find ourselves above the flattop mesa of the Micmac burial ground, swooping downward
The ground surges towards us
We see Renee's
The quality of light is different now
We hear the wail of the , and perhaps, the  of something altogether alien
And on the unsettling note, we
