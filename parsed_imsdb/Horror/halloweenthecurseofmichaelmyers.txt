Beyond the clearing wisps of smoke,   wearing black ski masks usher   -- arms and legs shackled in heavy chains -- into the back of a white van
Mutely terrified, Jamie backs away -- into the arms of another figure, obscured by smokescreen:  the Mysterious Stranger
Jamie's scream is cut off as the Stranger descends upon her like the Angel of Death

Crushed under the boot of the Stranger

Standing at the threshold
Waiting to receive the child

Doors fly open
Suddenly Danny is swept up in the protective arms of his mother, , 22
Danny
The little boy holds onto her for dear life
Crying hysterically
Eyes clenched tightly
(continuing) Shh
Mommy's here
What is it
The voice man
He's here
Kara looks in the direction he's pointing
In the light there's just an antique coat rack -- "dressed" in a hat, rain jacket and old silver-tipped umbrella
Danny, no one's there
Danny dares to look -- but now only cries harder
Kara carries Danny back to his room, averting the steely-eyed gaze of her father,  , staunch, late 40s, wearing boxer shorts and a well-worn undershirt
Some of us have to get some sleep around here
What's with that kid
Kara ignores him as her mother, , careworn face with compassionate eyes, tries to lend a hand
Let me take him for you, Kara
It's all right, Mom
Go back to bed
Debra sighs resignedly
, 18, stocky and streetwise, wearing torn red sweat pants and "Ice-" t-shirt, casually replaces his Walkman headphones and returns to his room
'  -  (   ) Kara opens the closet and switches on the light
Satisfying Danny that it's empty, she breaks into her perfunctory routine
Stay away monters, stay away ghouls
Stay away from Danny
You jerks know the rules
(crossing to Danny's bed) Better
Danny giggles as his pretty young mother tucks him in
Mommy, when can we go home
Kara sighs
They've been through this one before
Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house
At least while 'm in college
Remember our deal
The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here
They did, did they
Since when did we start listening to the kids at school
But 've seen him
You've been watching too much
He says things
Bad things
Like what
Danny is afraid to tell her
(continuing) If you mean the things Grandpa says sometimes, ignore him
Once he gets to know you he'll come around
Let the bad things you hear slide right off your back
Kara tousles his blond hair and kisses his forehead
Then she goes to the closet, just about to turn out the light -- (sitting up; panicked) No, Mom -- keep it on
Okay
But just for tonight
Kara adjusts the closet door, causing one of Danny's school drawings to fly off the wall
She picks it up on her way out
(continuing) Good-night, Danny
Kara softly closes the door
Danny lies awake, blankets drawn up to his chin, eyes wide
Still very much afraid
'  () Kara yawns, removes her glasses and rubs her eyes, setting Danny's drawing on a pile of open books
Cliffs Notes and Diet Coke cans
Telltale signs of a late-night cram session
Adjusting the dial on her /alarm clock, Kara begins to move about the little room, slipping out of her clothes as the subtly-seductive voice of a  comes over the radio: (
) know this sounds crazy, Harry, but  love him

) Let me get this straight, Debi
Now you're saying that not only does this guy get you sexually aroused, but now you want to bear his offspring
Wearing only her bra and panties, Kara moves to a full-length mirror and lets down her long, flaxen hair
Beneath her studious exterior, she is quite attractive:  delicate features with an enviable, naturally-toned figure
(
) Deep down, he's just like you and me
He just needs someone to understand him
Someone to love him
(
) You're talking about one of this nation's most notorious serial killers like he belongs in some kind of Est seminar
What planet have you been on, lady

Kara suddenly whirls around, startled by a  of something -- a face -- in the mirror

) Now we've got someone who claims he's actually seen Michael Myers
Does this whacko caller have a name
Staring out the window at the Myers house,  , a strapping 25-year-old with reddish brown hair and intense eyes, cradles a cordless phone
My name's Tommy
was only eight- years-old when  saw him
But  was lucky
survived
Tommy paces nervously around his sparsely-furnished attic apartment
Classic horror movie one-sheets and mint first edition comic books share wall space with a chilling array of guns, knives, and survivalist weapons
(
) Sounds like you're a candidate for electroshock therapy, Tommy
Don't tell me after all this time you still believe Myers is alive
Tommy pauses, mesmerized by one of the newspaper clippings
Michael's work isn't finished in Haddonfield
Now it's just a matter of time before he comes home to kill again
But this time 'll be ready

Eyes closed
Deathly still
Suddenly an urgent, pierces the darkness: (
) Jamie
Jamie
Jamie startles awake to see the midwife frantically releasing her straps
Come with me if you want to save your baby
Jamie can't believe her eyes
Mary opens a threadbare knapsack -- revealing the baby inside
soul-shuddering  echoes throughout the cavern
Jamie leaps up, eyes wide with fear, sensing the evil presence
Oh, God
He's coming
We've got to move
Now
Pulsing with adrenaline, Jamie harnesses the knapsack over her shoulders and follows Mary out into the tunnels
Chains  over rusted pulleys
massive iron gate rises, revealing a pair of filthy work boots
Legs planted in bold stance as a tall, ominous shape begins to emerge
The terrified midwife leads Jamie with her baby on a breathless flight through the winding network of tunnels
Haunted by the of the rising gate
- Gliding forward into the hollow catacombs
Slow by determined
Sensing the way
Reaching a corner, Mary stops and sends Jamie off in the opposite direction
There
It's that way
No -- Save your baby -- go now
Jamie runs, disappearing down the dark tunnel
Mary quickly removes her shoes and tears off, now
surges around a corner
Mary

Mary turns in small circles
Fear mounting as she falters into darkness
Heavy, labored  fills the tunnel

Leaving her impaled like a fish on a hook, the Shape resumes its relentless pursuit
Eerie under the lighted torches
Jamie runs frantically
Methodical, heavy  behind her
She chances a look behind
The Shape is coming
Jamie vaults up a dark stairwell
trap door above
It won't budge
Jamie frantically  against the hatch
The Shape mounts the stairs
Strength fueled by sheer desperation, Jamie forces the door open
Tumbles onto muddy ground
- Jamie drags herself out of the hole and half-runs, half-stumbles with her baby through an ugly, charred forest
Sharp branches whip at her face
falls
streaks across the sky
As if hell-spawned, the Shape emerges from the underground chamber and trudges forward, bold and unstoppable
Jamie tumbles into a gully, nearly dropping the knapsack
She picks herself up, hands groping at rain-sopped earth
The Shape is right behind her
-  () slap-happy, overweight  sips coffee from a 7-11 cup, straining to see the road through falling rain and fogged-up glasses
Harry Simms keeps him mindlessly occupied
(
) Next up is Dwayne
What's on your feeble excuse for a mind, "Dwayne
" The Motorisft lets out a hardy , spilling his coffee
Shit
Fingers burning, he searches the glove compartment for a napkin
(
) 'd just like to say that  listen to your show every night, Harry
think you're the best
can't tell you how excited we are that you'll be paying a visit to our little town tomorrow night
(
) Do you have a point to make here, Dwayne, or should  just keep practicing my wrist exercises
(chortles) Harry, you're too much
'd just like to say that  understand how things have changed in the 90's
Gays in the military, cut off your husband's do- jigger, become a national hero
But  just can't see any sense in bringing Halloween back to Haddonfield
The Motorist looks up
Eyes go wide with panic
Startled
Jamie stands in the middle of the road,  bloody-murder
/
() Tires
The pickup stops on a dime
The Motorist just sits there, mouth agape as the shrieking girl throws open the door and clambers into the passenger seat
Drive
Goddamnit, drive
Through his side-view mirror, the unsuspecting Motorist sees the outline of a quickly-approaching man
Unrolling his window, he rubbernecks a look outside
Hey, what do you think you're -- and   as the Shape's hands shoot through the window, twisting the man's head off his shoulders
Jamie
Lunges for the steering wheel
Slams her foot down hard on the gas
The pickup bullets forward, fishtailing up the road, never slowing down as the driver's door flies open, dumping the motorists's headless bulk into a muddy ditch
() Jamie drives
Checks to see that her baby is safe
Then lets out a
hysterical release of fear and rage, drowned out by the squabble of  over the radio: #2 (
) You're coming here for this Halloween fair -- it's all just a game -- a publicity stunt for you, isn't it Harry
These kids -- they're not old enough to remember what Myers did here
They look up to you
Now you're just asking for trouble
(
) You people really get me
What are they putting in the water in that town
: '  -  () and  pelts the windows of a bucolic cabin
This is a man's retreat and has been for years
Dark wood, worn leather, a few tastefully-chosen antiques

, Ph
After a  , "The Harry Simms Show" resumes, tinny-voiced  blaring over a handsomely-restored 1928 Bremer-Tully
#3 (
) All these fanatics aside, Harry, 'd personally like to thank whoever did the masked one in
Saved us tax-payers a lot of money in the long run
#3 (
) Yeah, that sucker's been dead for six years
It's about time they had a Halloween revival in this town
Now my kids can stop driving me crazy
behind a bald, sharp-featured man, hunched over a can as he reminisces over a collection of framed photographs -- memories of his wife and children
#4 (
) What happened to that psychiatrist of his
Loomis,  think was his name
heard the old quack was dead
Turning at the mention of his name is
himself, wearing spectacles, a comfortable sweater and his trademark goatee
For the first time ever, we actually see him smile
The burn scars on his face have all but faded away
Last traces of the horrid past
Not dead
Just very much retired
Loomis hobbles to the desk and finishes cutting out a newspaper article
As he arranges the strips of paper in a leather-bound scrapbook, a sudden  at the door gives him a startle
'  -  () An ominous , clad in hat and trench coat, stands beneath the glowing porch light, silhouetted in the pouring
Loomis opens the door, eyes straining in the semi-darkness, trying to identify his unexpected visitor
(sudden recognition) What the devil
Come in -- come in
'  -  () Shuffling inside, dripping with rain,
, a well-dressed gentleman in his 50s, removes his hat and coat, quickly making himself at home by the crackling fire
Christ, what a night
Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road
That's the whole idea of living in the country
thrive on the seclusion
Wynn heads for the kitchen, rummaging through cabinets and drawers as Loomis dutifully wipes up his muddy trail
(
) Don't tell me that the reviled Rasputin of Smith's Grove has grown complacent in his golden years
don't buy it for a single second, Dr
Loomis
Loomis immediately senses that Wynn has an angle
And in all these years, 've never known you to make house calls, Dr
Wynn
Especially at this hour
Wynn returns with a bottle of Irish whiskey and two shot glasses
Thrusts one in Loomis's hand and begins to pour
Unlike you, Sam,  learned many years ago not to second-guess the motives of my fellow man
Remember what Freud said:  'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar
'  Or, in this case, a drink is just a drink
hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud
As always, your keen powers of perception astound me
And you're right
've come to celebrate
(raising his glass) After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff
But surely Rogers isn't -- Retiring
Loomis is abruptly stunned and delighted by the news
Why -- congratulations
can think of no one better suited for the position
The two old sparring partners drink to the occasion
But Wynn's angle soon comes to the helm
Of course,  need a new Administrator
Someone who can bring new life -- and some old blood, if you'll pardon the expression -- back to our program
Loomis prepares himself for the bomb
(continuing) We need you, Dr
Loomis
You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me
You're the only man for the job, Sam
Things haven't been the same since you left
'm recruiting the best psychiatric team in the country
Old colleagues
This is your change to finally make a difference
Loomis scratches his head and settles down into his comfortable easy chair, amused at the irony of Wynn's speech
Even after my stroke six years ago they practically had to hold a gun to my head to get me to retire
Now things have changed
've changed
The ghosts have been buried
Why on earth would  want to dig them up again
Loomis finally looks over at Wynn, surprised to find him standing at the desk, looking through his scrap book
Seems to me there's at least one ghost that's still lurking in your closet
We follow Wynn's gaze down toward the open page
blazing tabloid headline:  "  -

The  rages

Bone weary, fighting panic, holding one hand steady against the wheel, the other on the  infant

Glowing salvation
Familiar red-white-and-blue logo

" - The pickup drives into the glow of orange vapor lights
to a stop in a deserted parking lot
Jamie staggers out, cradling the knapsack as she runs toward the old depot
- Jamie blasts through double glass doors
But the bus station is devoid of life
Empty benches
Blank / signboard
The low hum of vending machines
Jamie moves toward the ticket counter
handwritten sign left by the attendant:  "  20
" Shivering, holding her baby, Jamie enters an old-fashioned phone booth
Picks up the receiver and immediately dials 911
(
) You have reached Haddonfield Emergency Services
Due to severe weather conditions, all circuits are momentarily busy
If this is not an emergency, please dial directly
Jamie slams the phone down in terrified frustration
Suddenly she becomes aware of the radio program
Piped in over ancient loudspeakers: (
) For anyone who gives a flying circus, this is Harry Simms -- the light in your night, the love of your loins -- and  want to hear from more of you bogeyman believers out there
So give me your best shot at 1-800-878-7274
That's 1-800-
The   cuts in
Jamie picks up the receiver and frantically dials the number
'  -  () Wynn doesn't give up the sales pitch even as Loomis leads him to the door
The radio program still squawking in the b
g
But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone, you'd make the rules
Just think it over
Please try to understand, Terence
've already made up my mind
As Wynn continues to talk, his voice trailing off into nothingness, Loomis's attention is diverted to the  on the radio
(
) So they're trying to kill you and your baby
Don't tell me
Your name also happens to be Rosemary
(
) (intense whisper) No -- please listen
They're coming
coming for me and my baby
Loomis's eyes widen; a man possessed
(
) Come on, sweetheart -- what is this
Who's coming
(
) It's
Michael
(releasing) Michael Myers
Loomis staggers
lifetime of nightmares coming back to haunt him all at once
'  -  () in bed
Listening through headphones
Sitting upright
Thunderstruck
(
) Somebody help me
Dr
Loomis, are you out there
Can you hear me
'  -  () Wynn watches with rapt attention as Loomis unlocks his safe and withdraws a metal case
He pops it open, revealing his trusted
357 Magnum and a box of cartridges
-  () bus has arrived
The  returns to his post
Jamie hangs up the phone, filled with trepidation as  file inside strung-out
pair of stern-faced greeted in the loving arms of her
Just as she is about to step out of the phone booth, a  , back turned, wearing a hat and black trench coat, moves to stand outside the booth
Jamie freezes
Securing her baby in the knapsack, Jamie throws open the door
Suddenly the Tall Man steps in her path
Are you all right, young lady
Shaking uncontrollably, Jamie shrinks away
Backing down a narrow hall through the door marked "
" -  () Water runs into a grimy basin
Unable to contain her tears, she washes the newborn
Takes a roll of paper towels and tries to rub the triangular blood mark off his chest
Suddenly the lights go out
Jamie gasps
Clutching her baby, she turns off the faucet and melts into the darkness
The door  open

has locked herself inside one of the stalls
Heart pounding
The grow louder
Jamie's eyes dart frantically
methodically past the row of stalls, pushing open each door, revealing that they are all empty

and  inside
pushes on the door
An open window above the toilet
Jamie is gone
-  () Jamie trembles off a stack of crates piled beneath the window and dashes around the side of the depot
Suddenly the bus  by, sending up a muddy wave as it pulls out, disappearing down the highway
Jamie moves swiftly across the parking lot, clutching the knapsack
She throws open the door of the pickup and jumps into the driver's seat
-  () Slapping down the locks, Jamie thrusts the key into the ignition
The engine  to life
She guns it, peeling out of the parking lot
Back toward the highway
She drives on, suppressing her tears, stealing glances at the knapsack bunched up on the passenger's seat
Then she turns and looks forward with concentrated attention

" Jamie sighs with relief, steadying the wheel just as -- flash on right behind her, a juggernaut roaring out of blackness
Jamie's eyes flood with terror
'
- The grill of a familiar white van shoots forward,  violently against the pickup's rear bumper
is jolted forward in her seat
Holding on the wheel with a white-knuckle grip as she's repeatedly hit from behind
- The unseen madman noses forward, veering sharply over the double yellow line, scraping sides with the truck
Headlights sear a path through the night, locked in neck-and-neck profile
flashing at 70-miles-per-hour
The van forces Jamie onto the shoulder
It leaves the road, tearing branches from trees
Jamie
- quick-cut , events ticking out in fractions of a second like a nightmare: The pickup springboards over a gulch and slams down hard, tires spinning in waves of mud, careening through a vast field pumpking patch
The van reappears in a glare of headlights
Its engine screaming with fire-breathing rage
The pickup puts on a furious burst of speed
Eating up pumpkins and spinning out chunks of splattering seeds and pulp
The van bears down hard, slingshotting across the field, whizzing past the pickup, cutting right in front of it
Something heavy is thrown from the back of the van right through the windshield
Glass
Jamie , hands going up instinctively to protect her face
Swerving wildly out of control
She looks to see a sprawling, mutilated corpse on top of her
Wide, cold, lifeless eyes -- Mary
No
() The pickup rockets at breakneck speed toward the edge of the field
Suddenly -- '
The Shape stands in the field, tall and unmoving, white mask glowing hideously in the rush of oncoming headlights
The truck plows into the Shape, dragging it under,  headlong into the trunk of a huge oak tree
Everything is abruptly and shockingly silent
Like a phantom in the night, the van is gone
The Shape nowhere to be seen
Steam billows from the pickup, engine , a heap of shattered glass and mangled steel
Pinned against the base of the tree is a shape in human form -- a scarecrow
on Jamie, face-down against the steering wheel
Coughing on the noxious fumes, she stirs back to life
Slowly, painfully, she shoulders the door
Falls onto the ground
ignites
as the gas tank , setting the truck ablaze
Jamie turns, her face a frozen rictus of horror
Debris rains down on her
Suddenly a grim shadow rises from the field
The Shape -- wielding an enormous butcher knife
Jamie rolls onto her back,
No --
Suddenly the knife plunges down and lands with a terrible
The knapsack catches fire
but inside there is no baby
Only a roll of paper towels from the bus depot
burns; mocking Jamie with its grinning, hand-painted face
: looks at us, white mask scintillating against blinding rays of Rivulets of blood drip off a large carving knife
, we see it is a life-sized, knife-wielding effigy of Michael Myers, sitting astride the "For Sale by Strode Realty" sign
Stage blood spells out the words:  "He's coming
" -  () John Strode looks up with disgust as he inspects the grim monument that's been left on his front lawn during the night
Puffing on a cigarette, wearing slippers and a flimsy bath robe, John raises a large axe

Gathered on the sidewalk
Gawking, whispering, tittering
John angrily swings the axe into the signpost
The kids jump with a collective start
Enough

Suddenly the sign crashes down -- and "Michael Myers" with it
The kids huddle
John turns on them, brandishing the axe
(continuing) You stinkin' kids got three seconds to get the hell off my property
One, two -- That's all it takes
The kids scatter, tripping over one another as they tear off down the black
Satisfied with himself, John stubs out his cigarette and hauls the sign and its now-headless rider to the trash
Then he trudges up the porch steps, dropping the axe as he enters the house
Uttering oaths under his breath
over the surrounding neighborheed

She came back, as  knew she would one day
And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well
After six years
Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the -- That's what someone wants us to believe, but tell you Michael is alive

Sitting behind these very same walls
Staring
Growing stronger

can't go through this again
Not alone

Cancel all my appointments
Get Dr
Loomis anything he needs -- files, tests, records of every treatment ever administered to a former patient of ours -- Michael Myers
(stunned) Michael Myers
Wynn stops abruptly before heading out the door
That's right
We think there's a very good chance he might still be alive
Loomis acknowledges Wynn's silent understanding
Wynn and Loomis move along a sterile white corridor
Wynn uses his key card to  them through a series of metal security cages retinue of  and  fall in behind

Or what's left of him

Bro',  knew Harry when we lived in the city
Don't worry -- he'll be there
We've got everything arranged
Get with me tonight at the fair and 'll hook you up
Peace
Tim hangs up, guzzling down his shake as Debra navigates around him, setting out the breakfast dishes as Kara tries to study

Shitheads
Defacing my property

Relax, John
They were just kids
Kids are what's ruining this country
Everywhere you go, it's the same
No goddamn respect
Tim lets out a huge  as he finishes drinking his breakfast

You'll never pass that exam on an empty stomach, Kara
Debra snatches the book out of Kara's hands
(continuing; reading) Cognitive Therapy and Emotional Disorders
What are they teaching in college these days
The art of going crazy
(indignant) It's called psychology, Mom
Living in this house is what's driving me crazy
Who the hell told you to come live here in the first place
Kara rises, collects her books, trying to avoid a confrontation
'd better get Danny to school
She don't show her face for five years, then expects us to roll out the red carpet
You think going to college is gonna make up for your mistakes, girl
John, please don't -- Yo', just lay off her, Dad
Suddenly Danny runs in, showing off in his dinosaur costume
loudly
Startling John
What the fuck -- Kara immediately seizes Danny's hand and ushers him toward the back door
Let's go, Danny
Kara, wait
John
Can't we all just sit down
Try to be a family for once
'm sorry, Mom
Debra reaches into her purse and hands Kara a couple of dollars
That's it, Debra, keep slipping her the cash
While you're at it, why don't you just give her all our goddamn money
John explodes, dumping the entire contents of her purse onto the floor
Debra recoils
Kara steps in
Danny is terrified
Stay away from her, you bastard
(re Danny) only see one bastard in this house
Kara flies at him with Medea-like rage
John instantly grabs her by the neck and shoves her violently against the counter
Dad
Let her go
John
Stop it
Stop it
Danny looks outside
Frozen in horror
whispers
(
) Kill him, Danny
Kill him
Danny moves across the kitchen
Mesmerized
Through the screen door, the Shape can be seen standing in the back yard
Kara's eyes bulge as John squeezes her throat
Choking her
You ever raise your hand to me again, 'll kill you, you understand
John looks down to see the tip of a butcher knife pointed at his groin
Danny is holding it -- his eyes dark, emotionless
Ever so slowly, John releases Kara
Debra and Tim watch in horrified astonishment
Suddenly there's a  at the back door
Kara dives toward Danny
The knife clatters to the floor as she picks him up, grabs her book bag and hurtles outside

We're supposed to go over the list of events for tonight -- Beth is taken aback when she sees the bruise on Kara's neck

Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house
Pig
What the hell happened this time
Suddenly Tim jumps out from behind a clothesline, locking his arms around Beth, attacking her with kisses
(continuing) Hold on, hot lips
We got work to do
Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin' fair
It's only Halloween
Beth shoves the clipboard at him, a champion of her cause
How many times o  have to tell you
It's not about Halloween
It's about being political
There are too many people with corn-cobs up their ass in this town telling us what we can and can't do
If we want change, it's up to us to set an example
-  () Debra is on the floor, stifling her tears, putting things back in her purse
John stares coldly out the window

Debra rises, facing him scornfully
thought inheriting your father's house
the business
moving out here might change things
But you're still the same, John
(with finality) Kara has come home, and 'll be damned if  let you turn her away again
Debra storms off
John bores holes into her with his eyes

Kara and Beth in front
Whatever happened to women in back
Reality check, dillweed
This is 1995
Pulling away from the curb, Beth honks at
, at least 80, owner of the student boarding house across the street
(continuing) See you tonight, Mrs
Blankenship
The old woman just stares forward
gardem hose in hand as she waters a garden of long-dead flowers
Kara shields her eyes, distracted, looking up at the old Victorian house

Beth drives down a shady, tree-lined avenue, unaware of the white van that is following them
Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you
Why
You interested
No
keep seeing him staring out his window
Watching me
You mean Tommy
Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven
Supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid
Messed up his head
He's harmless, though
Probably just lonely
Tim leans forward, ravaging Beth's neck
Or horny
Tim, do you always have to act like such an asshole
Only when you're around to dump on
Hey, chill, sis
'm just doggin' ya
Suddenly the van  by and cuts them off
Beth lays on the Slams on the brakes
Narrowly avoiding a collision
Speed kills, asshole
Suddenly the van swerves around to face the  head on
For a breathless moment the van and the  sit at opposite ends of the intersection
Idling
tense stand-off
Who is that
Kara strains to get a look at the van's driver
momentary glimpse of a pale white face behind the wheel

Danny sits frozen in the back seat
Suddenly the van shoots forward, tires
Startled
The van turns off sharply at the last second,  down the next block
(relieved) Happy fuckin' Halloween
Someone's trying to scare us out of having this fair
and it's not gonna work
Beth drives on, grimly determined
Kara looks back at Danny
He returns her frightened gaze

Dark circles under his eyes

Can  help you, sir
Can you tell me if a bus arrived from Russellville last night
The Attendant checks her roster
Sure did
About seven hours ago
You lookin' for someone -- (walking away) Thank you
The Attendant eyes Tommy suspiciously as he enters the phone booth in the corner
Inside, he picks up the receiver and pretends to dial a number
Makes a cursory inspection

Shock and amazement overcome him when he lifts out a baby -- Jamie's baby

Someone partially opens the door, peering in from the hallway as Tommy removes his jacket and bundles the baby inside
Okay, little guy
You're okay

No one there
Hiding the baby, cradling his jacket, he hurries through the crowd and slinks out the door marked

The Deputy gives them a vexed glance
Wait here
Loomis's eyes flicker with nervous anticipation
The Deputy whispers something to   , a brooding giant of a man who dons a Stetson, holstered
44 Special and steel-toed boots that give new meaning to the term "bad ass
" Even Loomis steps back as the sheriff lumbers toward them
(extends his hand) You must be Sheriff Holdt
Holdt responds by stubbing out his Marlboro at Loomis's foot
As a matter of fact,  am
And  take it you're the infamous Dr
Loomis
'd like to introduce you to Terence Wynn, the Chief of Staff at -- Smith's Grove
They told me you'd be coming
Now  suggest you fly right on back to your crackpot asylum
You people got no business in my town
Michael Myers is my business
Holdt towers above him
want you to listen and listen good, Loomis
Things have been quiet for six years and that's the way they're gonna stay
The last thing we need is you spouting off your ghost stories
As usual, Loomis isn't easily intimidated

Maybe that same ghost is lying over there right now
Holdt fumes, ready to boil when -- Sheriff
She's alive

They've been lining up all night just to see Harry

Armed with her clipboard, Beth is assailed by her
Inundating her with

Laurie Strode -- Jamie's mother -- she was baby-sitting for me that night -- Loomis suddenly recognizes him
It's been a very long time
Yes
Tommy
What are you doing here
Please -- just tell me the truth
Has Michael Myers come home
Loomis pulls Tommy aside into an empty alcove
What do you know about Michael

People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead
But  know

Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life
She is the last of his blood line

Darkness fills Loomis's countenance as we : - We peer    of the Shape, standing across the street

Then crosses to another door -- the cellar door

Slowly she descends the rickety staircase

clunker of a washing machine  in the corner
Debra makes space for the crate in a storage cabinet
Suddenly the washing machine stops
Nonplissed, she moves toward it
Lifts the lid

Great
Frustrated, Debra looks down to see a large puddle of water forming on the floor

Okay, okay, Kyle

Puzzled, she steps off the porch and makes her way around the side of the house,   as she peers into the windows along the way
() Kara walks along the billowing clotheslines, passing the blank spot where the blood-stained sheets were -- and are no longer
She reaches the back door
Standing ajar
Mom
Casting one last glance across the yard, she steps inside
-  () Everything in its proper place
Kara drops her heavy bag on the kitchen table and proceeds down the hall
/  -    () The room is quickly falling into darkness
The eeriness almost palpable
Kara advances into the living room, eyes roaming
Mom
Danny
Nothing
Kara moves into the foyer
Her mother's suitcase still sitting there
Beyond, the cellar door stands wide open
Kara moves toward it, peering into blackness
sudden  from upstairs
Kara jerks the door closed and looks up the deeply-shadowed staircase
(continuing) Mom
Are you there
muffled
Kara mounts the staircase
() Kara reaches the second floor landing and moves slowly toward the door at the end of the hall
Danny's room
An orange glow flickers around the edges of the closed door
'
Her hand grabs the doorknob, turns it
The door swings open
' Someone sitting on the edge of Danny's bed
man
His back turned
Dinosaurs  on Sega Genesis
Danny squatting on the floor, engrossed in his game
Kara stares at the intruder in horrified disbelief
Who the hell are you
The man watching over Danny turns toward Kara
It's Tommy
-'m your neighbor from across the street
My name's Tommy
Tommy Doyle
Panicked, Kara makes a wall of herself between Tommy and Danny
The little boy isn't the least bit fazed
What are you doing with my son
Where's my mother
Tommy backs off a tick, calmly trying to explain
She wasn't here when  brought Danny home from -- (fortissimo) Danny, go downstairs -- Now
Danny finally looks up, exasperated
Tommy's my new friend
We've been playing 'til you got home
He knows all about dinosaurs
One look at Danny's black eye and Kara goes ballistic
My, God
What have you done to him
didn't -- He got in a fight and  -- You stay away from him
Kara starts to drag Danny away by the arm
He resists angrily
It wasn't Tommy
It was the voice man
Kara sees Tommy hunkering down in the corner, lifting something out of a crate -- a makeship crib
He turns, his expression very grave
Holding the baby
want you to listen very carefully to everything 'm about to tell you
Kara's face is a melange of wonder and fear as we : '   - Jamie lies comatose, ensconced in the dim  of monitors
Sustained by
s and a breathing apparatus
on Jamie
registers rapid heartbeat
on her eyes, darting beneath closed lids
-   ( ) Blood-chilling  as we  rapidly through a Blurred, indistinct images
wearing long white coats flash along sterile walls
As we  around corners, we realize we are seeing from the
of a girl being pushed forward on a gurney
It is Jamie
Her arm injected with a sedative
Eyes lolling
Succumbing
'
-  ( ) Even more  now, images swirling at random
Cold, staring Flashing lights on a wall panel:  "3-2-1-" -- an elevator
Going down
Down
Beneath the basement level
The doors open
The gurney  out into
Lighted torches flicker on craggy walls
(
) Please -- don't let him do this to me
(
) We're not going to hurt you, Jamie
He chose you
Now it's time
'
Pacing back and forth behind iron bars, agitated, disturbed Jamie strapped to a table
Surrounded by robed figures
Weakly, Jamie reaches out toward the cell
Please, Michael
Help me
Suddenly a long  fills the room
The
becomes more restless as the Stranger glides toward Jamie and disrobes
The figures close the circle
Jamie  in terror
The Shape's hands  violently against the iron bars, a horrific of metal as we : '   -  () Jamie's eyes flash open
dark shadow fills the room
The Stranger descends on her
Gloved hand covers Jamie's mouth
switchblade  open
(
) Your work is done, Jamie
The glinting blade  across Jamie's throat, cutting off her soundless scream
Then the Stranger flows out of the room
Spurs
Like a thief in the night
The shrill sound of a  going off as we : -  - The dark blanket of night envelops the little town
The  of the fair twinkle in the distance, bright and beckoning
Families -- men, women and children alike -- turn out from their homes wearing , joining a growing procession along the peaceful streets of Haddonfield
large group of  carry   in front of the campus gates
Rallying against the celebration
Haddonfield's finest out in full force, squad cars sweeping alongside a black   as it makes its way through town
Tinted windows make it impossible to see inside
/    - Tim and Beth, standouts as punk versions of Frankenstein and his bride, stride purposefully toward the fair entrance
Beth is a jumble of nerves as she runs down her checklist of events
Seven-thirty is the costume pageant
Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight
Photos for the school paper at nine
Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty
just know 'm forgetting something
Relax
Everything's cool
Didn't  tell you Harry would be here
The limo crawls into the parking lot
stampede of overzealous surge past them
That's what worries me
Tim and Beth move into the fair, with all its noise and colorful movement
waving signs and -shirts
Throwing themselves at the windows
Frenzied
Harry-mania abound
The  van parks parallel to the steps of the library, adorned with   and a large golden throne
The side door opens red carpet is rolled out
tall, imposing figure emerges from the van and walks up the steps
Spurs  on black boots
"Jesse James" style duster
Hat cocked slightly
(
) Hellllo, Haddonfield
The crowd turns in a mass of confusion
Standing above them, waving from a microphone, is
Dark sunglasses
Gaunt, glacial features and an outrageous mane of black hair
Suddenly Harry throws open his duster -- flashing them -- revealing that he has nothing on beneath except his boots and a pair of bright orange boxer shorts that say "
" The kids go insane
Making his way through the teeming crowd
Walkie-talkie in hand
The helicopter zooms overhead
Wynn's voice squawks over garbled Conducting a surveillance by air
(
) (filtered) There's more people moving eastbound down Old Reservoir Road past the elementary school
(into walkie-talkie) Any word on the location of the Strodes
(
) No one's home
Checked it out myself
Good
want around-the-clock surveillance on that house
Suddenly Loomis is waylaid by a giant wall of a man -- Sheriff Holdt
Loomis meets his fiery gaze
'm warning you, Loomis -- stay out of my way
You may have had free reign when Ben Meeker was sheriff, God rest his soul, but 'm in charge now
And 'm not about to stand by and watch you turn this night into some kind of sadistic witch hunt
(
) Sam,  just got word from the hospital
You'd better get over there right away
(into walkie-talkie) What's wrong
What's happened to Jamie
(
) 'll meet you over there
Loomis tears off
Holdt stares brazenly, throwing down his cigarette
Crushes it under his boot and slowly follows him
: -  - Carrying the  baby, Tommy leads Kara and Danny into the lobby of the vintage boarding home
Polished wood
Framed old paintings
Wall-to-wall Tiffany lamps
Mrs
Blankenship sits behind the front desk, oblivious to the and  on the television as "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" reaches its horrific climax on the annual Horrorthon
Quiet around here tonight, huh, Mrs
As usual, the senile old woman doesn't reply
(indignantly; to Tommy) Do you mind telling me what this is all about
Tim and Beth are waiting for us
Tommy ushers Kara and Danny up the stairs
Mrs
Blankenship stares at the boy -- the kind of stare that would send most kids running for their moms
But Danny is undaunted
'  () The door opens
Kara is repulsed by the sight of Tommy's musty, unkempt apartment
Mom,  want to go to the fair
(to Tommy) You can't expect us to stay here -- Tommy adjusts the blinds on the window looking out on the Myers house
want you to watch your house
You can see everything from this window
Kara glares, reminded of last night
Do you know how insane this is
Who am supposed to be looking for
Him
Tommy flashes a newspaper article in front of her
One we've seen eariler:  "  -
" The baby's  are verging on overload
Tommy dashes to the recessed kitchen area and heats up another bottle
As Kara reads, Danny tugs at his mother's blouse
Come on, Mom
We're gonna miss all the fun stuff
(snapping) Danny, you're just going to have to wait
Danny plods off
Kara hands Tommy a nipple for the bottle
Their eyes lock for a beat
He takes it
Shhh
It's okay, Kyle
Just give me one more -- (the microwave ) -- second
There you go, big guy
Kara looks on as Tommy attempts to feed the baby
Despite his clumsiness, she's undeniably moved
Behind them, Danny's imagination kicks into high gear as he drives a Power Ranger over an invisible race track
On the floor
Across the windowsill
Glancing across the street
'
- Standing below on the front lawn is the Shape, silhouetted under a moonlit tree
Looking right at Danny
Danny backs away, terrified
Tommy and Kara are too concerned with the baby to notice
God, what's wrong with him
Here
Let me try
Tommy gingerly hands the baby over to her
Instantaneously, Kyle's subside
(continuing; fawning) There
All it takes is a mother's touch
For one fleeting moment, Tommy and Kara find themselves smiling at one another
Unaware as Danny glides silently out the door
Tommy's expression darkens once again
man possessed
Kyle's mother might be dead for all  know
Now 'm afraid he could be next
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby
Not just Kyle
All of you
His entire family
(reaching toward Kyle) Here
Look at this
Tommy opens the baby's quilt, revealing the blood mark smeared over his torso
Kara's face registers terrified recognition
(continuing) It was there when  found him this morning
It looks like some kind of letter or number or -- It's a rune
Thorn
: '   /  - on the scene
crying  gives a statement snapps photographs as Jamie's bloody corpse is covered over with a white sheet
Loomis stands frozen in horror
Tears in his eyes
Jamie
failed you again
never should have left you
He spins, pouncing on Sheriff Holdt
(continuing) Now will you do something
How many more innocent people have to die
Wynn restrains him
Pulls him away
The sheriff doesn't budge
Don't do this to yourself, Sam
Let's go
Come on
Wynn ushers Loomis out of the room
Holdt stares apathetically
() Wynn tries to calm Loomis down
Jamie's doctor approaches
Dr
Loomis
What is it
'm very sorry
You let it get to her
How could you
Dr
Loomis, there's something else you should know
During surgery, we discovered that Jamie's uterus was hemorrhaging
We found this
(displays a small vital) It's placental fluid
God in heaven
You don't tell me she was -- estimate she gave birth no more than a few hours before the attack
Then where's her baby
Jamie's covered body is wheeled out past them
Loomis regards Wynn with a look of abject fear
think  may already know
: '  () a chapter heading
"Thorn - The Devil's Rune
"  Beneath it, a bold depiction of the familiar Thorn triangle
to  Tommy poring over the old library book
Kara paces, rocking the baby, feeding him with the bottle
Runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in Northern Europe thousands of years ago
They were symbols -- carved out of stone or pieces of wood
Of all the runes, Thorn had the most negative influence
Cults used them in blood rituals to portend future events and invoke magic
Black magic
(reads) 'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause sickness, famine and death
Translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices
on the Celtic celebration of Samhain
' Halloween
'When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil
' Tommy jumps up, frantically moving around the apartment, collecting his jacket, his keys -- a gun
(terrified) Where are you going
To find the rest of your family before Michael Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him
An ominous  as Tommy loads a cartridge into his gun
He bolts toward the door
Finds it standing wide open
Kara freezes, noticing for the first time that Danny is missing
Oh, God -- Where's Danny
Kara flies down the hall, the baby in her arms
Tommy moves out right behind her
-  () Kara and Tommy barrel downstairs, searching frantically
Danny
Danny
Mrs
Blankenship, have you seen the little boy who came in with me and -- They find Mrs
Blankenship and Danny sitting side by side, watching the Horrorthon
bowl of popcorn between them
(grabs him) Danny, don't ever walk off without telling me where you're going
Danny looks at her
blank, hollow stare
The old woman's eyes glitter madly
The voice
He hears the voice
Just like the other little boy who used to live in that house
Tommy throws on his jacket and opens the front door
Take the kids upstairs, lock the door and wait for me
(beat) And Kara, whatever you do -- don't go back to your house
Kara watches fearfully as Tommy heads out the door
Leaving her alone with the children
/  - Wind
Dead leaves blow across the  lane as Tommy flies down the path of the Blankenship house and hops into his Explorer
The Shape suddenly
Watching him peel off down the block
Taillights disappearing
moment later, another car rambles up the street, swerving erratically into the driveway of the Myers house
The Shape watches
-  () The car parks
Sits in silence
Suddenly the driver's side door opens, emblazoned with the "Strode Realty" emblem
John spills out, collar unbuttoned, tie dangling
Picking himself up, he staggers out of the garage
Laughing
Singing
Pretty woman, walking down the street
Pretty woman, the kind 'd like to meet
() John's circuitous route across the front lawn, stumbling over one of Danny's toys on his way up the porch steps
Damn kid
this is my house
John fumbles wth his key, estimates the location of the lock
He turns the knob -- but the door's jammed
Chain-locked
(continuing) What the fuck
(yelling inside) Debra, open this goddamn door before break it down
You got to three
(no response) One
Two
(still no response) Two and a half
John slams his weight against the door
It doesn't budge
Grumbling, John totters off the porch, trying to hold himself steady
Skirting along the side of the house
-  () John sways in through the back door and flicks on a light
Strains for lucidity
No one in the kitchen
Debra -- 'm home
No answer
John shrugs and moves to the stove
Opens the lid on a pasta cooker
Nothing inside
(continuing; mutters) Work all day and not even any supper
Frustrated, John opens the freezer and removes a frozen dinner
Tears open the box and pops it in the microwave
Then he flounders down the dark alley, knocking picture frames awry
/ Darkness, save for a glowing jack-o'-lantern
John stands there, listing
Bewildered
Then he switches on a lamp, kicks off his shoes and crashes onto his lumpy old recliner
All right
You can all come out now
Still no reply
John sneers, flicks on the television with the remote control and settles back into his chair
- scene from another horror movie
boy shreds his pumpkin mask as a mass of beetles and snakes pour out of his skull
What is this shit
Disgusted, he switches channels to the local
shrill from the kitchen startles him
The microwave
John waddles to a drawer and removes a set of utensils
Then he reaches for the microwave, opens it
But his dinner is gone
Spinning around, he sees the piping hot entree already sitting out on the kitchen table
John double-takes, mentally retracing his steps
Shrugs
as he picks up his tray and plods back down the hall
Suddenly he trips over something -- the suitcase Debra had packed earlier, sitting smack-dead in the center of the hall
So this is the game you wanna play
Fine
Go ahead
Keep it up all night
John settles back into his chair and begins to eat ravenously
from the television
He reacts
- Someone has switched it back to the horror movie -  causes more masked heads to
John shakes the remote
Out of the corner of his eye, he catches a shadowy figure darting by in the darkened foyer
Is that you, you little brat
Danny
John rises, about to go for him when suddenly the power cuts out -- and the entire house is plunged into blackness
(continuing) When  get my hands on you, kid, you're gonna wish you were never born
John pulls a rechargeable flashlight from the wall and goes to the cellar door
It stands open
An invitation to enter
(continuing) Oh, 'm scared
'm really scared
With that, John steps down into the basement
() John tentatively descends the stairs
Barefoot
The flashlight beam preceding his every step
below
The cellar is lit only by a shaft of moonlight cutting through the single dusty window
John probes around, shining the flashlight over cobwebs, boxes -- the puddle of water at his feet
Now flooding the entire floor
John  through the water toward the washing machine -- which is running at full tact
What the hell -- He opens the washer lid and lifts out a water-logged sheet
It drips red onto the white appliance -- blood
John backs away, loses his footing, and slips in the water -- landing right at the Shape's feet
John  as the Shape grabs him by the neck, lifts him off the floor with one hand, then carries him across the basement and  him brutally against the open fuse box
The Shape's free hand lifts an enormous butcher knife
loud as it's driven to the hilt into John's chest, through the fuse box
Sparks wain from the wall
Electricity courses through John's writing body
() Lights flash on and off in the windows
Suddenly the entire house is plunged into darkness
-  () John's toes curl
The skin around where the knife penetrates The Shape steps back, head tilted,  steadily, curiously observing John's hanging, lifeless body
: - Tommy grabs the ticket he's just paid for, hands it to an and moves through the turnstiles amid a steady stream of
Loud , the aroma of apple cider and pumpkin pie fills the air
Boots selling food and crafts
Children carving jack-o'-lanterns
Parents beaming with pride
Trendy co-eds playing games
Ducking for apples
Shooting pumpkin-faced balloons with water pistols
Tim and Beth sit on either side of Harry as he interviews them during a live
large crowd gathered below
(into mike) 'm here with Tim and Beth -- the organizers of tonight's event
How does it feel knowing you've finally pulled Halloween out of the closet
(into mike) Yo, Harry, it's great
And having you here with us is dope
Totally raw
You're the ultimate juice
'll remember that the next time my wife tells me  didn't make her climax
(impassioned) What Tim means is that we've taken a firm stand against censorship
Not only for Haddonfield, but for every town in the nation
Our generation will not let the powers-that-be control our minds, dictate what clothes we wear, what music we listen to, or what holidays we celebrate
Beth's rousing speech is met by gales of enthusiastic
(off-handedly) Have you ever considered running for public office
: -   - The distant  of the celebration are carried on the wings of the
Howling through dark, empty streets
Rows of deserted houses
Not a soul in sight
Preternatural stillness
- Kara looks nervously out a window, then walks into the parlor where she finds Danny sitting in the dark, glued to the Horrorthon
Flames  in the fireplace, casting weird shadows
Mrs
Blankenship sits in a wooden rocker, cradling the infant, humming a lullaby
If we look closely enough, behind her in the window we can see the hazy shadow of the Shape looking in
Mrs
Blankenship, what did you mean about the little boy who used to live across the street
The old woman doesn't seem to hear her
Lost in her own world
(continuing; insistent) Mrs
Blankenship, please
This is important
Mrs
Blankenship looks up sharply, startling Kara
He heard the voice
Same as your boy hears
What voice
What are you talking about
The voice that spoke to Michael Myers
The one that told him to kill his family
Kara stares at her, numbed
She gazes over at Danny, his eyes riveted  -- not to the  screen
Looking past it
Across the street at the Myers house
The haunting  whispers to him
(
) 'm coming for you, Danny
'm coming
: - Tim and Beth ride high atop the Ferris wheel
Their smiling faces aglow in a dizzying whirlwind of

light  begins to fall
Walking, searching, hunting
Past a large tent where children are gathering
sign reads:
Tommy reacts to a terrified
Just a couple of teenage pulling an innocuously fightened  onto another ride
walks steadily past the bright lights of the Ferris wheel
pushes through a dense crowd
Suddenly he bumps shoulders with the Stranger
More people pass
There was something very sinister about that man
Tommy turns to look again, eyes widening in terror
'
- ' Branded with the mark of Thorn
removes his gun
Flows through the crowd like a vengeful wraith
People see the gun in his hand and back away
Tommy surges forward
The Stranger walks faster
Gaining ground
Toward the Halloween tree
hauling wheelbarrows loaded with jack-o'-lanterns cross his path
Tommy stumbles, pumpkins spilling out all around him
The Stranger is getting away
Tommy picks himself up, raises the gun and begins  shots into the air
People , scattering like insects, ducking for cover
Stop that man
Stop him
Tommy races through the horrified crowd
The Stranger keeps moving, never once looking back
Suddenly
Squad cars converge
Sheriff Holdt and a slew of surround Tommy
Weapons trained
Throw down the gun
Now
Tommy drops the gun
Puts his arms up in surrender
The cops swarm in, taking him
Stop that man
He's the one
Beth and Tim exit the ride and follow the crowd toward the flashing of the police cruisers
Who's gettin' busted
Beth is stunned to see Tommy being searched spread-eagle over the sheriff's car
Jesus, that's my neighbor
Tommy
Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister
(worried) Kara and Danny never showed up tonight
We'd better go home and check on them
There's nothing else for us to do here
But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes -- (suggestively) We can light our own tree at home
She brushes against Tim's crotch and saunters away
Tim glances back at Tommy, then follows her like a hungry puppy
: - '  - Kara rushes Danny and the baby inside
The old spinster close at her heels
Releasing her dark secret
was baby-sitting for him that night
Little Mikey Myers from across the street
That's when the voice told him what to do
Same as his great- grandfather
His what
Eighteen-ninety-five
hundred years ago to this night
All Hallows Eve
Murdered his family in that very same house
Then the townspeople burned him alive
Our mother always told us when we were children, 'Don't go near the Myers house
'  We never did
: -  () The Stranger glides unnoticed among a large crowd gathered for the lighting of the Halloween tree
People putting up umbrellas fast approaching
Hundreds of anxious kids stand beneath the oak tree with open bags and pillow cases, waiting for the candy to drop on them
behind the tree where a long-haired figure stands in the darkness
Waiting to make a presentation
turns, sensing a presence
knife shoots out of the darkness, jabbing him right between the legs
: is shoved into the back of the squad car
Suddenly Loomis appears
Prevailing upon the sheriff
Wait
This boy is being placed in my custody
Tommy looks out, stunned
What are you trying to pull now, Loomis
Uncuff him
This is a matter of life or death
: The knife is lifted straight up, splitting his torso in two, eyes bugging with shock
He slumps to the ground in a huge pool of blood
: The sheriff uncuffs Tommy and shoves him out of the car
You'd better as fuck have an explanation for this, Doctor
Loomis begins to usher Tommy through the gaping crowd
Dr
Loomis, there's something you should know -- Tommy is prodded forward by Loomis's
357
know enough already
Just shut your mouth and take me to that baby
They move swiftly through the gaping crowd
growing murmur of concern spreads
"Where's Harry
"  The children are becoming impatient, and the impending  isn't doing much to calm anyone's nerves
Harry's people are at a loss to explain their star's whereabouts
On the fringes of the crowd
Walking away
"Oohs" and "ahhs" as the tree suddenly comes to life with thousands of orange lights
From the boughs of the tree, ropes are pulled
Bunting tears open, dropping hails of  on the  kids
Tommy glances back
His eyes drawn to something
Grotesque and misshapen
In the tree
Oh my God -- Kids of all ages scurry around the stage, laughing and screaming as a rainbow of candy  down on them
Diving for it
Fighting over it
Scooping it up in big handfuls
Tommy instantly breaks away and tears back through the crowd
Tommy
Loomis goes for him
Sheriff Holdt sees what is happening and flies toward them in pursuit
looks down at her white pillow case in horrified astonishment
Her hands painted red as she reaches inside
All of her candy is covered with blood
The other kids back away in revulsion -- the entire stage begins to drip with blood
The adults don't seem to notice what is happening, more concerned with the sudden burst of
Tommy pushes his way through the crowd,
Get them out of there
Get out
Sheriff Holdt tries to intercept Tommy just as he leaps up onto the stage, pushing kids out of the way
Parents' faces register shock when they see their children running toward them,  hysterically, soaked with blood
Loomis sees what Tommy sees
Words cannot convey the horror in his eyes
Just then, a    ignites the tree
flash
Tiny pumpkin lights  in a startling chain reaction
Tommy helps the last of the kids off the stage when something falls from the gnarled branches:  a dangling, rotating, wrapped-up thing
The mutilated remains of Harry Simms
Horrified, Tommy dashes headlong off the stage
Runs with Loomis with the trampling crowd
Struck dumb with terror, Holdt looks out upon the mass destruction
The bloody corpse hanging from the tree
People running, , carrying their children toward the exits
() Bumper to bumper cars
Horns
Women
Men
Children
Pandemonium
Loomis and Tommy appear out of this jumble of confusion
More people running along the sidewalks
Oh, God -- Kara

Loomis right behind him
Running toward home
Once again, terror reigns in Haddonfield, Illinois
: - '  - Kara shivers as she curls up beside Danny on the futon, holding the sleeping baby close at her bosom
rattles the old house
Mommy, 'm scared
There's nothing to be scared of, baby
It's just another storm
Try to get some sleep
can't
The voice man is coming to get me
No one's coming to get you
Not while 'm around
Promise
(kisses him) promise
Kara stands up and goes to the window, looking out into the pouring

- Dark and foreboding
Beth's car parked in front
She stares at the car, puzzled
Quickly she moves away from the window, heads out the door
She  loudly on the door across the hall
sign that reads: "Beth's Place
" Beth, are you in there
She knocks again
No response
Another
Kara shudders, quickly returns to Tommy's apartment and locks the door
-  () Sounds of  as we  a trail of hastily-discarded costume pieces across the darkened foyer
Tim and Beth are on the stairs, half-naked, kissing fervently
(coming up for air) Guess they -- went to the fair after all
(hot and heavy) Guess so
Tim nuzzles his face in Beth's chest
She's feeling apprehensive
What if your parents come home
Then they can watch
Laughing, they heard up the stairs, kissing, fondling each other
Slowly we   into the foyer
and  , revealing the Shape, knife held at ready
Watching

We  the phone  on the other end

The
Tim ignores it, consumed by passion
Beth sits up nervously
Aren't you gonna answer that
Answer what
(fends him off) What if it's Kara
Frustrated, Tim jumps off the bed and stomps into the bathroom, taking a candle with him
Fine
You answer it
'll make friends with my soap on a rope
Tim slams the door
Beth deliberates her move, then goes to pick up the phone
(into phone) Hello
' Kara is frantic
Looking out the window at the Myers house
(into phone) Mom -- Who is this
(
) Kara
No, this is Beth
What are you doing there
Where's my mother
- '  () We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were -- (
) Is Tim there
He's in the bathroom
-  () lighted candle flickers
Tim waits for the running shower to warm up as he does a bare-ass jig over to the sink
Rinsing off his tooth brush, he elbows out a circle of steam from the mirror
He gasps
The Shape is standing right behind him
Before he can react, Tim's head is yanked backwards
The chilling of his neck is punctuated by a
' Kara can  Beth on the phone
Sitting by the window
'm across the street
can see you
Beth,  want you to listen to me
Get Tim and get out of that house
Right now
Unnoticed by Kara, Danny rises and crosses the room
Drawn toward the door by the irascible voice
(
) Come to me, Danny
Come to me
- ' Beth shifts nervously, looking out across the way at Kara
drowns out the sound of the bathroom door  open
The Shape advances
Kara, what the hell is going on
' Kara's mouth suddenly drops open
Her mind snaps into sensory overload
She can see the Shape walking up behind Beth
Raising a gleaming butcher knife
Beth, look out
There's someone in the room
He's right behind you

She falls,  against the vanity
Beth  unholy terror
But the Shape isn't through
' Kara stands frozen in pure horror, hearing and seeing her friend's vicious murder
Her eyes shoot down
little blond-haired boy is walking steadily across the street toward the Myers house
No, it can't be true
Kara wheels around
Danny is gone

Danny, no

- He glides up the porch steps and slips through the front door of the Myers house
Disappearing inside
shoots across the lawn
Up the porch steps
Right behind him
- Kara dives through the front door
shatters the house
Everything is frighteningly dark
Shockingly quiet
Inch by inch, she makes her way inside
Eyes wide
Savage
Shaking uncontrollably

She jumps out of her skin
Just the door  shut in the
(the faintest whisper) Danny
She advances into the hall
Old floorboards  beneath her feet
up ahead
Kara looks up
Danny is nearing the top of the stairs
Instinct propels her up the stairs after him
Then suddenly she stops dead
Reason taking over
And she turns back
Picks up a fireplace poker sitting in the corner
Then she heads back up the stairs
Mind-blown with horror
Kara reaches the top of the staircase, looking down the dark hallway
Summoning all of her courage, she moves forward
Suddenly Danny darts out from the adjacent hall and disappears inside his bedroom -- a fleeting, ghostly image
Kara startles
Follows him inside
' Danny stands in a corner
illuminates his toy dinosaurs
Kara goes to him, takes his hand
He resists her
(intense whisper) Come on
Danny, please
She picks him up, carries him toward the door
Kara stands paralyzed in the doorway as the Shape stalks down the hall
Eyes probing
Walking right past them
' Kara slips silently back into the room, carrying Danny through the bathroom
Adjoining on the opposite side into ' The walls are covered with blood
Kara stumbles over something on the floor
Cranes her neck to look down
Beth's bloody, mangled remains at her feet
Shock waves send Kara reeling backwards against the open bathroom door
Hanging on a hook is Tim's naked body, eyes open, staring at her in a horrified rictus of death
Kara
Drops Danny
Quickly covers her mouth
Realizing that she's given them away
Suddenly the bedroom door tears open, buckling off its hinges
The Shape bulldozes in, wielding its huge butcher knife
Danny, run
Danny ducks into the hall, evading the Shape's lurching hands
careens down the stairs
brandishes the fireplace poker at the killer
The Shape moves in, backing her through the bathroom
into Danny's room
Suddenly she  the door on the Shape
Kara tears off into the hallway
Turns
Waiting for the Shape to appear
It doesn't
Kara vacillates down the hall
Jumping at every sound
Training her weapon at things unseen
doors along the way, sealing off every passageway as she tries to find her way through the impenetrable dark tunnel
Suddenly something  down from above
Kara's mother, strung up on a bloody sheet, dangling upside-down from the trap door in the ceiling
The axe still protruding from her chest
Kara , shrinking away from the gruesome sight, faltering through the blackened doorway behind her
An unbearable moment of tension as we think the Shape's mask will be there
Suddenly the Shape shoots up directly in front of her
Tearing the dangling corpse from the sheet, dislodging the axe from Debra's chest with a repulsive
Kara wheels toward the stairs
The Shape advances
Swings the axe
Misses her by inches
Kara ducks, lurches behind the Shape
Swings the fireplace poker with everything she's got
it full-force over the back of the Shape's head
The Shape breaks through the banister and plunges off the landing, hard onto the floor below
Terrified, Kara chances a look down
The Shape doesn't move
/   -  () Tommy's Explorer skids to a stop outside the boarding house
Loomis and Tommy fly up the front path
Tommy glances back at the blackened Myers house for a moment, then follows Loomis inside
-   () Kara barrels off the stairs
Moves cautiously past the Shape
Sprawled face-up in the middle of the hall
Kara searches for Danny, keeping her eyes trained on the Shape
The little boy appears in the doorway directly across the hall
The Shape lying in between them
Danny, come to Mommy
Danny shakes his head
Too frightened to move
/ Ever so slowly, Kara moves toward the threshold
Hefting the fireplace poker, she steps right over the Shape
Instantly she snatches Danny up in her arms
Takes one step forward when suddenly -- Mommy
The Shape springs up, twisting Kara's ankle
She falls, splaying forward
The Shape claws at her leg
Kara fights back, kicking herself free of the vice-like grip
Scrambling to her feet, Kara rockets Danny through the foyer to the front door -- desperately trying to escape from this real-life house of horrors -- only to find that it is locked
The Shape rises, gleaming butcher knife in hand
Kara twists the deadbolt, but someone's secured the chain lock
Too late to remove it
The Shape is right behind them
Only one way to go
The cellar
Kara shoves Danny through
() Kara and Danny clatter down the rickety stairs and  across the flooded basement floor
soul-shuddering  on the door above
Kara ushers Danny toward the elevated window
The cellar door , the Shape's hand breaking through, splintering the wood as if it were paper
Kara  the Shape moving rapidly down the stairs
Lifts Danny up the wall toward the window
But it's not a wall -- it's John's electrocuted body, propped inside a storage cabinet
Danny , staring into John's lifeless eyes
Kara pushes him up
Danny reaches for the lock
Just an inch away
Kara can't lift him any higher
The Shape is coming
Danny hoists himself up just enough to twist the lock
He pushes the window open and clambers outside
Kara scrambles up old pressboard shelves
They break under her weight; she topples back to the floor
The Shape wades toward her
Reaching up for the window
- Danny watches his mother struggle to climb out of the crypt
Danny, help me
Kara's hand reaches toward him
Danny makes no movement
(
) Come to me, Danny
Come to me
Danny obediently turns and starts to walk away
Danny
- Kara's foot falls on the handle of the knife jutting from her father's chest
Uses it to springboard herself half-way through the window
Clawing at wet grass
The Shape's hand shoots out of the darkness below, grabbing at her legs
Kara writhes, kicking and
- Kara grabs chunks of mud as she is pulled back through the window
The Shape yanks hard
Kara catches herself on the window frame
Quickly losing her grip
- The knife swipes downward, swiping her ankle
- Kara reacts to the searing pain, releasing her grip on the window frame
Suddenly Danny appears, locking onto her collar, pulling her clear in one massive heave
Kara shuffles across the ground and picks herself up
Grabs Danny's hand and runs full-tilt around the side of the house
/ their frenzied flight across the street
Past Tommy's Explorer
Kara limping
Danny surging toward the Blankenship house
Kara , pounding frantically on the door
Please
Open the door
- ' Tommy and Loomis have turned the apartment upside-down
The baby -- where's the baby
Suddenly they  Kara's frantic pleas outside
Tommy bolts out the door
Loomis right behind him
() Kara  furiously
Please
Somebody help us
Danny huddles beside her, peering out across the street
'
- The Shape trudges boldly down the porch steps -- knife in hand
Kara sees the Shape -- walking slowly and deliberately toward them
Her become even more intense
Help us please
The Shape closes in
At the last second, Tommy throws open the door
Kara and Danny tumble inside
Into his arms
-  /  () Loomis slams and deadbolts the door
Get them upstairs
Now
Kara pounds against Tommy's chest
Hysterical
Where's the baby
He's gone
Kara holds Danny close to her side, backing away in horror as Tommy and Loomis go around the parlor, securing the doors and windows through the darkened room
(continuing) Who else knew  had the baby
No one
No -- there had to be someone else
Who knew
Only me -- (dark realization) -- and Dr
Wynn
Suddenly the window behind Kara
She , recoiling
Then the window in front of her
reach through
Tommy shoves her out of the way
shoots through the stained glass window in the front door, twists open the lock
Danny races across the lobby and up the stairs
Robed figures fill the doorways
Climbing through windows
Moving inside the house
Surrounding Loomis
(continuing) Wynn
The robed figures descend on Loomis
Drops his
357
Tommy lurches for it, to no avail
Loomis's  fills the darkness like a fever dream
(continuing) Run, Tommy
Run
No
Tommy backpedals up the stairs
Kara pulling him along as the cloaked figures glow toward them
Daggers raised
Kara reacts to the  of Danny's
Mommy
Please help me
Kara rushes through darkness to find him
Danny
Danny, where are you
Kara, no
Kara trips and falls
pair of silver-tipped black boots planted in bold stance
Slowly she looks up the long duster, the cigarette in the gloved hand of the nefarious Stranger -- Dr
Wynn
Danny stands by his side, staring dispassionately
Danny, no
please
Kara picks herself up, shaking her head in unmitigated fear, staggering back down the hallway
She turns to see the black figures overtaking Tommy
His swallowed by hollow darkness
Alone, Kara careens through another doorway into ' Kara slams the door, turns in desperate circles
Stepping out from behind the door is Mrs
Blankenship -- the baby bundled in her arms
Mrs
Blankenship -- Oh, God -- Hurry
We have to -- As Kara reaches for the baby, the old woman raises a dagger
Her eyes burning
Her wrist branded with the mark of Thorn
Kara
The old woman opens the door, allowing the figures to enter the room
Daggers drawn
a dark invocation
The coven forces Kara backwards
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Suddenly Kara makes a decision -- and takes a running leap toward the window
() Defenestrating herself, Kara , tumbling through the air, bouncing off the porch overhang before plunging to the front lawn below thousand grass fragments raining down on her
lies on her back, eyes close, hands folded over her chest in silent repose
She doesn't move
is still
Unearthly silence fills the cold October night
: '
-  - ring of faceless figures move in, completely surrounding her
Suddenly the feeling of
Glowing torchlight flickers across dank walls
is being pushed forward on a gurney
Strapped down
for God's mercy
is wheeled through another tunnel
His face a mass of bloody cuts and bruises
His eyes glazed over, trying to find focus
into darkness
- illuminates the cold, forbidding asylum
The white van pulls up to the security gate
Headlights illuminate the sign:  "'  - " The main gate cranks open
The van pulls through
pulls to a stop near the main building
The door slides open and Danny steps out, surrounded by Smith's Grove staff wearing white jackets
Leading him toward the entrance
The helicopter touches down
Wynn ducks out, moving in long, even strides toward the building
- Wynn through the series of security cages, using his key card to through
White coats bringing up the rear
Through tall mahogany doors, they cross purposefully into the adjacent wing
Dawn, Wynn's efficient secretary, rises with a congenial smile
Good evening, Dr
Wynn
Your -- appointment is waiting inside
Wynn picks up his messages, then heads straight into the office
Dawn resumes her typing
Something eerie in her grin
'  -  () Wynn and his staff file inside
Removing his hat and duster, he walks over to where Loomis is seated -- shackled to a chair, a bloody slash across his forehead
Seeing this, Wynn snaps angrily at two burly
What is this all about
Remove those
The guards comply
Loomis rubs his aching wrists, glowering
Where's the child
Sam, you know you never fail to amaze me
Yesterday happily retired, today right back in the thick of things
Somehow  knew you still had it in you
Loomis sees his
357 resting atop Wynn's desk -- only inches away
Wynn's hand covers it, slips it inside the top drawer
(continuing) Come now, Sam
This is a gathering of old friends
know how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your upbringing and integrity -- but now that 'm in charge felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth
(gestures to his staff) After all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were
This isn't the way  wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice
This is madness, Wynn
Your madness is another man's greatness
This is the way things have always been
You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see
(beat) But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways
(smiles) You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog
Finding him
Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work
Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time,  had to go after him myself
And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell
It was you
(lights a cigarette) Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar
Why did you take Jamie
She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins
Michael's mother had it, too
So for six years incubated her, prepared her for this night
Michael has served his purpose
And soon we will have a new progeny
Jamie's baby
There you go trying to make sense again
(grimly entranced) It's a curse
Handed down through countless generations
As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween
Samhain
And 'm its deliverer
(slams his key card on the desk) Its calling card, if you will
follow it
Protect it
Act as its guardian
In a sense, Sam, so do you
Loomis shudders, rocked by these revelations
(continuing) know you have more questions, my friend, and there's so much more for you to try to make sense of
Loomis is hoisted out of his chair and led out of the office
Wynn and his white coats flow out behind him
- tight, damp, claustrophobic space
Tommy is strapped upright to a crude metal rack, not unlike the one Jamie was bound to the night before
Feverishly he rubs his wrists against a jagged metal edge, cutting through skin, wearing away his bonds
Breaking through
-  () group of white coats, led by Wynn, usher Loomis off an old service elevator, leading him through the dark passageway
Wynn turns around, surveying the tunnel
As he walks on, we  something fall from his back pocket
As they disappear down another tunnel, a wooden door slowly  open
Tommy appears, cautiously stepping out into the catacombs
Edging along the dank, torch-lit walls
Rats scamper past his feet
Wynn has dropped his security key card
Tommy swipes it
() Loomis is led across a narrow precipice overlooking a filthy prison cell
The Shape lies inside
Dormant
Wynn stares down hypnotically at his most prized possession
Michael Myers
Look at him
So silent, yet so deadly
He moves when tell him to
Act on my impulses
Feels what  feel
Wynn demonstrates
Loomis looks on, spellbound
(continuing) Michael -- Rise
Below, the Shape slowly rises
Wynn takes out his trusted switchblade
(continuing) Michael -- Pain
Wynn cuts his hand
The Shape grabs his own hand in agony
Wynn smiles, sucking the bleeding gash
(continuing) Michael -- Kill
Suddenly Wynn whirls around, throwing Dawn -- his faithful secretary -- inside the Shape's pit
Wynn watches with hideous delight as her horrified trail away into blood-gurgling
Loomis closes his eyes in anguish
You've created a monster
Amazing, isn't it
even taught him to drive
Wynn carries on without remorse
Loomis is brutally shoved forward
(continuing) We're not the only ones, you know
There are many believers -- generous contributors to our church
You'd be amazed to know how far it reaches
- metal door  open
Tommy makes his way furtively inside, pocketing the key card
storage room filled with sawdust and wooden crates
Tommy pries one of them open
Eyes widening in startled disbelief
small arsenal of automatic rifles and ammunition inside
Holy shit
Tommy lifts a rifle, awed by its devastating lines, then slams in a cartridge and bolts out the door
Back into the tunnels
- large, amber-hued chamber
The  coven forms a circle around a primitive stone altar where Kara is tied down, wearing a white gown, her head adorned with a wreath of mistletoe
wooden symbol of Thorn, like an inverted crucifix, hangs in a place of reverence
Behind the altar, the Shape stands in its cell
Waiting
Loomis is led inside
Wynn glides through this macabre gathering, up to the altar
Looming over the terrified Kara
The  continues as Wynn dons a magnificent ceremonial robe
At Wynn's gesture, there is
The worshippers offer an obedient response, removing their hoods, baring the mark of Thorn on their wrists
We recognize many of the faces in the congregation
Wynn's staff
Dr
Bonham
Mrs
Blankenship
The cross-eyed attendant from the bus depot
People from all walks of life
Faces glazed with sadistic rapture
(prophetically) Behind, Disciples of Thorn
The final sign
The birth of the heretic child, delivered unto us on the eve of our great Feast of the Sun
as  have foreseen it
Jamie's baby is carried forth,  as it is lain inside a baptismal urn beside Kara
Ringed by candles and a circle of stones -- eleven in all -- etched with symbolic runes
Letting the rifle guide him, Tommy makes his way through the tunnels
Toward the sound of   up ahead
The coven  its invocation
Wynn draws a magic circle around the infant with blood from a silver chalice
Then he inscribes a pentagram in the air with an ornate dagger
Spirits and powers of the flame, attend and witness this ritual
Bear our gifts to Thorn
Open us to the path of Darkness
By these runes transform us
Open our eyes and show us the Chosen One to whom we offer this sacrifice of Innocent Blood
Suddenly Danny is issued forth up to the altar
His eyes dark, lifeless pools
Kara struggles against her bonds
Danny
Loomis lurches forward
Halted by massive, restraining hands
Tommy moves cautiously along the narrow wooden lip, looking down upon the evil ritual
Startled by the  of rusted chains
Pulleys
The Shape's cell being opened
The Shape emerges from its cell and slowly walks forward
Strangely calm
Hypnotized
Looming above Kara
She lets out a  of unbridled terror as he raises a gleaming dagger
Wynn stands behind Danny
Places the dagger in his hand and holds it aloft
Above the baby
Strong and fierce Thorn, Thundered, by thy hammer we summon thee and offer this sacrifice of innocent blood
Let thy Darkness descend on your son
Danny
Lord of the Dead
Danny drifts into the dark spell, holding the dagger above the infant
Wynn speaks in the ominous  : (continuing) Kill for him, Danny
Kill for him
Kara cries, appealing to the boy inside of Michael
Michael, please
You can make him stop
You remember, don't you
The Shape stares hard at her through the sockets of its mask
Listening
Reminded of his mother
(continuing) Remember what he did to you that night
What his voice told you to do
You can stop it, Michael
Stop the voice forever
Danny's eyes flash like fire
The  is insidious
Kill him, Danny
Kill him
Danny, don't listen
The voice isn't real
Danny turns sharply, seeing his mother
Suddenly terrified
Kill him, Danny
You feel the rage inside
You are Thorn
Suddenly Danny drops the dagger
Wynn flies at him,  like an enraged beast
The Shape raises its dagger and plunges it -- into Wynn
Wynn's eyes go wide with shock
The Shape lurches empathetically
Wynn staggers, yanks the blade from his stomach
-  rip through the chamber as Tommy lets loose a barrage of bullets from above
Taking out several coven members, the rest scattering, retreating into the tunnels
Loomis dives Danny a split second before he through Kara's bonds with the dagger
Kara springs toward the baby as the room is ripped apart by
The altar decimated
Candles falling
Setting the room ablaze
Wynn releases the supports which suspend the catwalk
Wooden girders down from the ceiling
Tommy pitches to the floor, dropping the rifle
The Shape staggers, trying to get to its feet
Slowly
Painfully
Flames lapping at its back
Loomis crawls toward the rifle
Grabs it
Rises just as Wynn seizes Danny, a dagger at his throat
Pulling him away
No
Stay away, Sam
Leave the boy
Take me
Loomis slowly places the rifle down in front of Wynn
Surrendering himself
Tommy drags himself toward Kara and the baby
Paralyzed with horror as they try to anticipate Wynn's move
(smiles trenchantly) Good-bye, Dr
Loomis
Loomis turns
Gasps in startled reflex
The Shape rises up behind him, swiping the dagger across his chest
Wynn retreats and flies through a doorway with Danny
Mommy
Danny
Tommy and Kara race across the flame-engulfed room, reaching the door just as it  shut
Cutting them off
The Shape, the trail of flames growing on its back, hurls Loomis over the crushed altar
Tommy sees Loomis writhing on the floor, about to go for him when -- The Shape turns on them
Tommy stands in front of Kara and the baby, backing away, propelling them out into the tunnels
The Shape walks forward in fevered pursuit, all but consumed by fire
Tommy, Kara and Danny race deep into the heart of the tunnel maze
painfully crawls away
Die, Michael
In the name of God, die
Tommy, Kara and Danny reach the tunnel end
Kara pounds frantically on the elevator panel
-- the  of fire as the Shape sweeps toward them
glides steadily through the tunnels
walking pillar of flame
Undaunted
Unstoppable
Hell-spawned
Finally the doors open
Kara and Tommy barrel inside
Mashing buttons until the doors close -- a millisecond before the Shape reaches them
Kara cradles the baby
Tommy waits anxiously as the old elevator  and toward ground level
The doors open
They barrel off the elevator and race down a long corridor
This way
Tommy leads her toward an exit sign
Behind them, the elevator doors close
The indicator light shows it moving down
They reach a dead end
The row of coded security cages
What now
(realization) Wait a minute
He reaches into his pocket -- withdrawing Wynn's key card
Suddenly the elevator doors open
The Shape emerges, totally engulfed in flame
The emergency sprinklers are activated
Dousing the flames as it walks after them
Tommy panics, runs the key card
The gate  open
They run through
The Shape's hands lurch through the bars, missing Kara by inches
They race toward the next gate
The gate behind them opens, and the Shape walks through
Tommy runs the card again
The gate
They slam it -- one step ahead of the Shape
The third and final gate
Tommy tries the card
Nothing
Come on
(tries it again) It's not working
The Shape moves through the last gate
Inside the cage with them
(continuing) Someone's controlling it
'  () Standing behind his computer, observing them on the security monitors, Dr
Wynn jams the card's access code
Then he grabs his satchel and strides quickly out of the office
Pulling Danny with him
On the screens, we can  the Shape approaching
Kara's  can almost be heard on the silent monitor
() Kara  as the Shape rakes Tommy against the cage
Kara cowers in the corner, protecting the baby
-  -  () Wynn races with Danny across the field toward the waiting helicopter
Getting ready for take-off as they duck inside
The Shape slams Tommy's head against the bars; he slumps to the floor
Then turns its murderous attention on Kara and the baby
' hand reaches into the top desk drawer, removes the
357 and  an entire round into the security console
Destroying it
The man holding the gun is Loomis
The door  open
Kara drags Tommy and the baby out
Slamming the door shut on the Shape
Trapping it inside
The Shape lurches against the bars in wild paroxysms
- Tommy comes to as he races with Kara and the baby across the windswept field
Suddenly they stop dead, watching in horror as the helicopter lifts off
Kara stands paralyzed with shock, looking skyward
The helicopter disappears into the gloom-filled night
Tommy drags Kara in another direction
vehicle parked nearby
The white van
() Kara lifts the baby inside
Tommy flops down in the driver's seat
Face bruised and bloody
key in the ignition
Kara holds Jamie's baby
Tears falling
How will we ever find him
Tommy's gaze terrifies her
He starts the engine and tears off toward the sanitarium gate
Kara looks down at the baby, then stares numbly forward
In the back of the van, we can  the the Shape's white mask
Glowing in the darkness
Emerging
Kara and Tommy drive on, unaware
And that, for now, is how we leave them
