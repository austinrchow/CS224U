Written by Lawrence
Cohen & Stephen King : From an absolutely glistening   an image which first appears to be a brilliantly shining glass globe, and then gradually becomes more of a piece of solid matter, less of a mystery
It's the ( ) 1
like a picture postcard
Modest, old-fashioned, spotless  a vision of small town normalcy and virtue
This is the home of   and her daughter
It seems to have been scrubbed from roof to porch; it is white
Even the lawn seems to have been washed and bleached
Antiseptic
We hear a woman's voice: (o
s
) Carrie
Carrie The voice is distant but insistent
It is heard, in perspective, through the following prologue, which initially involves: 2 An all-American sunbathing beauty of eighteen, getting the tan of her life with only a skimpy white bikini running interference between her skin and the sun
The     the expanse of her body  luxuriant, taking it in inch for inch as she dreamily rubs in suntan lotion and licks her lips
The  is coming from a transistor radio by her side; she's on a beach blanket in the Horan back yard
3 As she senses someone standing over her, someone staring at her body through the half- grown hedge which separates the Horan back yard from the White house next door
(
) What are those
4
' terribly appealing little girl, a child of indeterminable age
Pink cheeks, a halo of blonde- white hair which will darken in time
What sets her apart from other children, however, are a pair of bright button brown eyes; and it's these eyes that we notice as she peers at Stella through the hedge
Hiya, Carrie
Gee you gave me a fright
(turning down the radio) How long have you been there
(not smiling; pointing with her finger) What are those
Stella looks where Carrie is pointing; the top of her bikini has slipped, just barely revealing her breasts  white against the golden tan
Stella adjusts her suit  not out of any particular modesty of her own but as a reflex at being stared at so strangely
Those are my breasts, honey
(a beat; then solemnly) wish  had some
You will
`Course you'll have to wait a couple of years, but (a fact) No  won't
Why, sure you will
(emphatic) No,  won't
(glancing behind her) Momma says no
Momma says good girls don't
(at something of a loss) Well, 'm a good girl
And besides, doesn't your mother have breasts
5 Glances anxiously at the mention of her mother at the White house next door
She swallows her words so that all Stella and we hear is: dirtypillows
What
Momma calls them dirtypillows
Says she's got them `cuz she was bad when she made me
6 Incredulous
But she senses that Carrie is both perfectly serious and quite worried, and she too glances warily over at the White house just beyond the half-grown hedge
She kneels next to Carrie and tries to laugh it off
Now, honey, that's just silly
Listen  you must be real hot in that long dress
What do you say we go inside and get us some lemonade, would you like that
7 Clearly torn  tempted but in the clutch of some weird terror  as if she expected the earth to open and swallow her up
She shakes her head
'mon
(offering her hand) It'll be our secret
Carrie  now really scared  shakes her head and disappears farther into the hedge
can't
Sure you can
make it nice and sweet, and And just at that moment, a figure appears in the second-story window in the White house
Although Stella and we really can't distinctly see through the sun's glare, it's unmistakably The moment this big woman sees her daughter with Stella, she lets out a bloodcurdling scream: 8 , Both frozen by this terrible sound 9 ' As she sucks in her breath, quivering with fright, looking as if she might faints
She looks quickly to Stella, then back at the White house, then back to Stella
For the merest flash, she seems to smile  or is she about to cry
And then, she's gone  running around the hedge and then up the porch stairs and into the White house as fast her legs can carry her
10 Stands there, riveted
Not knowing what's happened, what to do
It's utterly silent for a moment
And then, an incredible  of strange sounds starts coming from the White house  an unearthly babble as Margaret White screams, rants, and screeches; as Carrie sobs that she's sorry, that she forgot
Mother
(louder) Mother
11 As
in an old housedress with the hem falling down in the back  rushes out to answer to her daughter's call
What in the name of God
What's the matter
(frantic) don't know
Carrie was just talking to me, and Mrs
White started screaming and
12 The sun glistening brilliantly on it as in the opening shot
Again, it should appear like a huge glass globe over which we counterpoint one mother/daughter dialogue with the less distinct babble of another: (v
o
) told you to stay away from there,  told you
(v
o
) 'm sorry, Momma
(v
o
) to stay away from that girl, that whore
(v
o
) Please, Momma
(v
o
) of Babylon
Which continues over: 13 Their eyes riveted on the house  trying, squinting to see through the sun's terrible glare
Don't you yell at her like that
Stop that
That poor sweet child
Mother, we've got to do something
What
Call the police
Mother, call the police
(not about to interfere; hopeless) The child
At this point, the hysteric babble reaches its crescendo; we should be able to pick out phrases in this cacophony as Margaret rants at Carrie to go into her closet and pray for forgiveness; as Carrie's frightened little voice proclaims that she forgot, that she's sorry
And then suddenly the screaming stops and it's quiet  dead quiet
14 As it becomes more distinct, visible
There's a low  sound, and then what appears to be a stone the size of a small pebble lands on the roof
Another, slightly larger one appears a second or two later
And then another, and another, and
15 squinting, blinking at the pebbles which are coming down like marbles
16 as it's pelted with what are now even larger stones  ,  in the air like miniature bombs
Stones from a perfectly blue summer day
Stones ranging in size from marbles to handballs
One of them hits a downspout, knocking it onto the lawn
, as these pieces of granite tear into the stucco roofing, leaving holes
The effect is that of a drum being bombarded
17 Frozen to the spot: Mrs
Horan with her hands over her ears, her screams blending with the of larger and larger stones as they pelt the house and we hear Margaret throughout screaming: ' Stop that
Stop that
Stella is clutching Mrs
Horan like a child terrified by the freakiest of summer storms  a healthy young woman as her figure in the bikini testifies, but a child nonetheless, this nightmarish moment
18 As still larger stones hail from the sky
And then just as suddenly and inexplicably as they started, they stop
19 Mrs
Horan with her hands still over her ears, her daughter standing next to her, transfixed on the lawn
Once again, it's quiet
20 As one final stone  this one the size of a mere pebble  falls from the roof and plops onto the lawn
The image grows lighter and lighter
All the color seems to bleach out, turning the screen once again into an incredible, silently blazing white
21 Now some years later  and no longer glistening so whitely or mysteriously
We see the front of the house as the door flies open
Carrie, now sixteen or seventeen, appears in the doorway, carrying school books
As she comes out on the porch, the screen door bangs behind her
She is wearing a shapeless, drab dress  much too long, not so much out of style as utterly without style
What remains in this adolescent girl that links her with the pretty child we glimpsed in the prologue are those remarkable eyes
As she comes down the porch stairs, we hear: ' Carrie
Carrie stops, turns to reply into the house
Yes, Momma
' You come straight home from school
moment of hesitation on Carrie's part, a very slight hint of rebellion, but: (sweetly) always do, Momma
Then she turns, walks to the street, gathering pace, quickening
22 As Carrie walks down the path from the porch and turns at the sidewalk, in the course of which she passes by where the Horans used to live
Only the Horans no longer live here
No one does
It's a vacant lot with a   sign out front, with overgrown weeds
From the looks of them, the house vanished a long time ago
23 Carrie is walking to school, the sun shining brightly above her
The farther she gets from her house, the livelier she seems
We sense that underneath this drab dress is a girl pushing out, an altogether different creature than her appearance would suggest
And to help persuade us about this possibility, there is
24 About five,  bikes on the other side of one of the streets, keeping pace with Carrie on a twenty-inch Schwinn with training wheels
Hey, fart-face
Hey, old praying Carrie
Praying, Carrie, praying Carrie, praying Carrie
Carrie favors him with a sweet tolerant smile and goes on toward the high school, in the background: Bobby, frustrated, stops astride is bike and screams after her
Bobby's face : 25 Or as he is known in school,
He is pathetically thin, myopic, weak-chinned, beak-nosed, almost a caricature of an adolescent reject
Over his face, we : ' What are you going to leave for us, You people in your big cars Spewing pollution into the air
We  the faces of adolescents, listening with various degrees of attention, indifference, or reluctance, to: ' You people with heavy feet Trampling down the wilderness
You people who peer into the back seats of our cars Hours after you come out of the back doors of your motels
Soon all we will have is each other, and that could be enough
26 Or, as he is known to his pupils,   , at his desk in front of the class, reading from an assignment paper
If you will let us have room enough And air enough And peace enough To love each other As you never could 10 He sets down the paper, and looks at the class
27 ' We will see, among others, Carrie
We also see    a mid-seventies version of the boy next door
Good-looking, clean-cut, intelligent, athletic
28 He is nodding his head slowly, affecting a kind of puzzlement
must say   must confess  this poem displays an extraordinary talent
(the knife) a talent extraordinary for you, Tommy Ross
29 All eyes are on Tommy, who doesn't seem very abashed
In fact, he turns, clasps his hands over his head, to the delight of his classmates
But you don't get the feeling he is a goof-off; he is a kid aware of his own popularity and comfortable with it
30 Tommy, this is slightly different from running for a touchdown
Any criticisms
31 The usual hesitation
Then Carrie's hand shoots up
32 He appears surprised to see Carrie, ordinarily shy, volunteering
Carrie White
33 11 Her volunteering has surprised her as well
But she's stuck with it
The eyes of the class are on her
And she has to say something
So she does
It's
beautiful
34 He leaves his desk, moving into the class area, seeming to pounce on Carrie
`Beautiful
' `Bee-t-ti-ful
' `Oh beautiful for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain
' Is that the beautiful you mean
The class is snickering
Carrie throws a despairing glance toward Tommy
Tommy looks at her, and away, embarrassed
Carrie looks down at her desk, almost burying herself
That isn't exactly a criticism, Miss White
(looking around) Anyone else
(no one else) Well, at least we've finally gotten Carrie White to say something
Tommy looks toward Carrie, with something suggesting compassion
Then he looks toward Fromm, and he is muttering something
Or to be specific: (muttering) You suck
Tommy
You said something
Yes, sir
(moment; "popular" grin) said
`shucks
' But everyone in the class knows
: 35 12 36 Two teams of girls, among them  ,  ,  and (sisters although not identical twins),   and Supervising the game is   wearing a warm-up suit and holding a whistle awaiting the next point
Among the girls is  anxiously watching for the ball to come her way
It has apparently been a close game, the competition building steadily
When the shot begins, Miss Collins has just blown her whistle to announce: Okay, now
This is game point
This is the final point of the game and Rhonda Wilson is serving (she is on the opposite team as Carrie)
(giving the score) Twenty  Twenty
The ball is successfully served and remains in play for some time as the girls skillfully volley it back and forth over the net
And then, just when the tension is its greatest, the ball comes over the net toward Carrie
It's evident that the outcome of the game depends upon her success
The little boy who decided to put his finger in the dyke had it easier
The other girls are ( ) shouting cautions and admonitions to Carrie
Carrie almost trembles with tension, about to bat the ball over the net, afraid to hit it
Carrie whacks the ball
She shacks it hard
And on a line  straight into the net
Another chorus of groans, with remarks like "Wouldn't you know
" and "Dumbo
" reinforcing them
Chris storms back toward Carrie
(low, harsh) You eat shit
Miss Collins blows her
: 13 37 Steam partially obscures the girls as they whoop and holler and cavort under individual showers
They banter little barbed pleasantries, bits of sexual information, family plaints, talk of college  all of which we hear from separate stalls
One by one the showers are turned off, the girls stepping out, removing pastel bathing caps, toweling, spraying deodorant, bras hooked, underpants stepped into
Steam hangs in the air
So do words, running into one another, tumbling, drifting
`
Tommy says he hated it on me
My sister's husband picks his nose
So does your sister
too cheap to spend a penny
we'll go after school
'm going with Billy, we'll meet you
Friday night
' We   Miss Collins as she steps among the girls, spies Carrie still standing under the shower
She claps her hands together once, smartly
What are you waiting for, Carrie
(as Carrie looks at her) Bell in five minutes
Oh uh
As Collins departs, and the other girls start to move toward their lockers, Carrie is left alone in her shower stall
She is soaping herself
In a virtual reverie, she begins at her shoulders, moving her hands over her breasts in small, regular, virtually erotic circles
Her hand goes out of frame, below her stomach
Slowly, it emerges back into frame  full of blood
And just as she and we see this, so do the girls
Peer-iod
Peer-iod
Carrie stares at her dumbly
The other girls are quick to take up the chant
Chris leads them
Peer-iod
Peer-iod
Peer-iod
Peer-iod
One voice chimes in: 14 Plug it up
Others take up this new chant
For a while, like counterpoint, he chants overlap; then the new chant emerges solely: Plug it up
Plug it up
Plug it up
Plug it up
Dime-sized drops are striking the tile floor at Carrie's feet
For God's sakes, Carrie, you got your period
(as Carrie turns toward her) Clean yourself up
Carrie seems bewildered
(furiously) You're bleeding
You dumb pudding, you're bleeding
Carrie looks down and wails, the sound is very loud
tampon strikes Carrie's chest, plops to her feet
Carrie just stares at it
She thinks they're for lipstick
Behind her, another girl pretends to throw up
Shrieks of laughter
Another tampon strikes Carrie
Another
The girls are bombarding her with tampons and sanitary napkins, some from purses, some from the broken dispenser on the wall
As they bombard Carrie: Plug it up, plug it up, plug it up, plug it up
We isolate Sue Snell at the moment she joins in the chant, and watch her beginning to be caught up in what can only be described as a fury
Carrie howls and begins to back away, howling louder and louder
The door is flung open by Collins
15 What is this
And she takes it in
She jerks the whistle to her mouth, blows and blows
The sound is louder than a shriek (which it resembles) or a howl (which it doesn't)
And there is sudden silence
(to girls) Get out
Get out
The girls retreat, Sue last
It must be her first
Out
As the girls slip out, Collins turns to Carrie, who has backed up and is whimpering
Collins slaps her face, not too hard at first, then with a flash of anger
Miss Collins
Stand up
Take care of yourself
'm bleeding
One blind searching hand comes up, clutches Collins' white shorts, leaving a bloody handprint
Damn you
She hurls Carrie part way across the room toward the broken sanitary napkin dispenser
Get over there
And take one
16 don't know
Never mind the coin slot
It's broken
It hurts
my stomach
(grabbing her) Do it
Now
can't
don't know how
There's a bright flash as a light  , fizzling out
Collins is surprised
What
And she looks at Carrie
Her anger seems to seep away
Her voice softens
Carrie, don't you know
(shakes her head, realizing and wondering) You don't
(reaches for Carrie) 'll show you
: 38A 38
' , the principal, a decent but somewhat plodding man in his mid-forties, is tapping out his pipe as he talks to Collins
Isn't she a bit old for her
Well, he can't quite say it
17 Her first period
Ah, yes
Morty, until a half hour ago,  don't think she knew there was such a thing
He hesitates a moment  noticing Carrie's bloody handprint on Collins' gym shorts
It's hard to believe in this day and age a girl in high school wouldn't know
something
the facts
Well, knowing that mother of hers
(cutting her off) Miss Collins, if you'd been with us longer, you'd understand we cannot interfere with people's beliefs
As for the girls Carrie's always been their scapegoat
So they
You'll have to do something
will
But  understood how those girls felt
The whole thing just made me want to take the girl and shake her
Ummm
It's just her period, for God's sake
(cutting in; uncomfortable) We'll send her home
(to intercom) Miss Finch, send in Cassie Wright
18 It's Carrie White
(fiddling with paper clips on his desk) Oh
The door is opened
Carrie stands in the doorway
Come in, Cassie
Collins starts to correct him, but: Close the door
No, wait
(up) Miss Finch, bring in a dismissal slip
(to Carrie) think you might take the rest of the day and go home and, uh, well
take care of yourself, Cassie
(hardly a murmur) Carrie
We're all sorry about this incident
, elderly, spinsterish, goggles in with the yellow dismissal slip, brings it to Morton who initials it
(to Finch, as she goes) Thank you
(to Carrie) Would you like to go to the infirmary
Carrie is shaking her head
lie down for a while
think Carrie can go home
19 Would you like a ride
Again, Carrie is shaking her head
We could call you a cab
'm sure she can walk home
And Carrie, you're excused from gym for a week
Take study hall instead
Morton picks up the dismissal slip, hands it to Carrie
We are sorry about this, Cassie
(sudden fury) That's not my name
Two things happen simultaneously; Morton recoils slightly and the ashtray quakes a little and then tumbles from the desk
Then Carrie goes out
Morton comes around the desk, stoops to pick up the ashtray, stares at it curiously for a moment, then looks at Collins
(slowly) That reminds me
light blew out while  was trying to calm her down
'll send a janitor to fix it
Okay, that's reality
He puts the ashtray back on the desk decisively, dismissing any "peculiar" thought he may have had
: 39 to show red circles of a traffic light
20 Carrie is standing at an intersection, waiting for the light to change
40 ' Cars are flashing by; they seem to leave blurs of light
41 Carrie's tormentors
42 Carrie
43 The girls throwing tampons and sanitary napkins
44 Carrie, hatred showing
45 Suddenly their motions are
Their images polarize; the girls disappear, except for Chris
Her image
46 Concentrating her hatred 47 ' It begins to shatter
And then explodes
48 Turns green 49 She walks across the street
21 50 quiet residential street in a lower middle-class neighborhood
Carrie is walking down the street, slowly
51 There comes Bobby Erbeter again on his bike, paralleling Carrie (as before) Hey, fart-face
Hey, old praying Carrie
52 She keeps on walking, ignoring him
53 Keeping pace with Carrie, shouting across the street
Fart-face, fart-face, fart-face
54 Turning toward him, her face contorted with rage
55 ' The bike wobbles on its training wheels
And the bike topples over, on top of Bobby, who screams 56 57 now, featuring her eyes most prominently
Her face is uncertain, confused
What just happened
She thought (that's right, thought) something and it happened
And we  another , more of an angry shriek, and then the strange sight and of: 22 58 As the stones pelt the White bungalow years ago
59 The stones pelting the roof
60 She is staring across the street at: 61 Screaming with anger (more than anything else) as he disentangles himself
He stands up, looks toward Carrie across the street, shakes his little fist
(defiantly) Fart-face
62 The boy's defiant chant can be heard as Carrie blinks, wondering
Then she opens her eyes, wider
She looks at the boy
She frowns for a moment
63 The stones
The light bulb exploding
The ashtray falling
We hear: ' Fart-face, fart-face, fart-face
64 faint smile, partly of wonder, partly of a strange kind of joy
She knows
23 : 65 Sue's mother
Out of a margarine commercial  a packaged, nice lady, neat, trim  a good mother, good wife
She is preparing dinner; in her line of sight, a television game show glitters
Eleanor frowns momentarily, leaves the kitchen
66 Through the middleclass, rather tasteful home, to the front door
Eleanor opens the door
67 Standing in the doorway
She is a large lady dressed in black, carrying a worn black leather sack, which we will discover is bulging with religious tracts
68 Margaret White is not a welcome visitor, but Eleanor Snell is a polite lady
Oh, Mrs
White
How have you been, Mrs
Snell
Fine
And the doctor
Fine
And your daughter
24 Sue is
fine
An impasse
Finally Eleanor feels constrained to open the door wider, put a smile on her face, and: Won't you come in, Mrs
White
Thank you
She steps inside and Eleanor closes the door behind her, saying: think Carrie is in some of Sue's classes
Yes
Perhaps some time Carrie might visit
'm here on the Lord's work
Yes, of course
Margaret is fishing tracts out of her bag
These will interest the doctor and you
Eleanor looks at the tracts with pretended interest 'm sure they will
And your daughter
(a smile) Well,  don't think Sue would be 25 (cutting in) Children are godless these days, Mrs
Snell
Margaret's voice is almost toneless  now and throughout
My Sue is a good girl
These are Godless times
'll drink to that
Humor  and she regrets it immediately
(continuing; quietly) We'll all read
these
The telephone
Excuse me
(retreating) Please sit down
Margaret doesn't sit, and Eleanor flees into the kitchen
69 As Eleanor reaches the phone
Hello
Betty, can  call you back
Margaret White is here
Right
right
Let me get rid of her and 'll call you back
She hangs up, opens a drawer, takes out some hidden household money (a couple of bills), and drags herself back into the living room
70 Margaret is still where we left her
26 We'd like to contribute ten
(a look at Margaret) twenty dollars
Thank you
'll give you a receipt
Eleanor shifts from foot to foot while Margaret writes out the receipt, gives it to her
Thank you, Mrs
White
'll pray you find Jesus before it's too late
What can one say
Eleanor stands there, completely exasperated but retaining her politeness like a steel, middle-class glove
She accompanies Margaret to the door and the latter leaves
Eleanor is about to close the door, stops, seeing: 71 Sue is coming toward the door
She passes Margaret with a quick (inaudible) greeting and hurries to the front door where her mother is waiting
That's Carrie White's mother
As Eleanor nods and closes the door
(apprehensively) What did she want
(indicating tracts) She gave us these (conspiratorial sigh) and  gave her a donation
Sue's face betrays relief, but Eleanor notices nothing
(brightly) Well, how was school today
27 Today
Like always
Sue, staring at the tracts on the table (or perhaps out the window as Margaret leaves)
long beat, then: : 72 Who is sitting in an old Boston rocker by the window in her room which overlooks the street
She is wearing just a slip or perhaps an old terrycloth robe  her plain dress and school books on the narrow bed
She is leafing through a teenage magazine on the order of "Seventeen"  absorbed in the mundane fantasies of models in their pantyhose and underwear; long gowns and mystery men
An escape of sorts
And we reveal Carrie's bedroom in the low attic of the White house: tiny, plain, severe
It's decorated with just the fewest embellishments (i
e
high school pennant) that Margaret would allow in exchange for her own prices  a crucifix above Carrie's bed, a small bureau with an equally small mirror, a Bible and plastic glow-in-the-dark Madonna and child, and various religious prints and plaster quotations on the wall
73 Caught up in the magazine, in the most normal of female fantasies courtesy of the slick Madison Avenue mind
And then, with that extra sense of perception apparatus that fears it's about to be caught doing something it shouldn't, Carrie glances out the window and down to see: 74 As this formidable vision of black strides down the walk
Another woman like this would be coming home from a funeral; Margaret actually seems to like black
75 Her heart pounding as we glimpse that look of terror we witnessed earlier  a scared little girl now encased in the body of an adolescent
As she hears Margaret close the front door and call out her name as she hangs up her coat, Carrie hastily stashes the magazine under the mattress
Then she begins to dress as we hear the  of Margaret in the kitchen, starting her daily afternoon ritual of making tea
28 And then the telephone   only to stop as Margaret picks up the receiver
It's just as Carrie dreaded  it's the school  and she stands by the door, trying desperately to overhear Margaret's muffled voice
And then Margaret hangs up, and in a deadly tone of voice  not yelling but enunciation with a terrible clarity  she calls up the stairs: ' know you're listening
Come downstairs
And defeated, Carrie braces herself and goes down the: 76 , ,  , As she hurries down toward her mother and into: 77 Where Margaret is standing by the stove, her back to her in stony silence
Hello, Momma
No response
The teakettle is just beginning to boil over the gas burner, and in this altogether strange little kitchen  a veritable arsenal of lace-tatted religious art  Margaret is a rock
29 Carrie sits down at the kitchen table, bursting with shame and the need to talk
Yet she recognizes her mother's wall of silence, knowing she won't speak until she's ready
They've been through this dance a thousand times
Finally, Carrie breaks
Who was it that called
(no response) What did they say
78 Point one and some grim satisfaction
Yet she doesn't respond immediately
Then she turns from the stove
(softly) You're a woman now
Oh Momma, why didn't you tell me something
was so scared
Margaret walks over to the table and sits next to Carrie
She puts on rimless glasses, then opens the Bible and starts to read with one of those strange Kathryn Kuhlman looks on her face: `And God made Eve from the rib of Adam
And Eve was weak and loosed the raven on the world, and the raven was called Sin  ` She pushes the Bible at Carrie, her finger on the place
and the raven was called sin
Why didn't you tell me
Oh, Momma (overriding) and the raven was called Sin
and the first sin was intercourse
30 was so scared
And the other girls, they made fun of me and threw things and Margaret's hand flashes out, backhanding Carrie into the wall
It's a wallop of a slap, the sting of it bringing tears to her eyes
Momma, please listen
It wasn't my fault
Another backhanded blow knocks Carrie to the floor
Momma
And Eve was weak and
say it, woman
Kick
Momma, please help me
And Eve was weak and loosed the raven on the world
They threw things
(overriding) and the raven was called Sin
Sin
and the first sin was intercourse
Momma, please listen
kick
And the Lord visited Eve with a curse, and the curse was the Curse of Blood
31 The teakettle starts to
You should have told me
Margaret clutches Carrie's wrist in a vise
(heavenward) Lord, help this sinning woman see the sin of her days and ways
Show her that if she had remained sinless No
-- the Curse of Blood would never have come on her
She may have been tempted by the Antichrist
She may have committed the Sin of Lustful Thoughts
The teakettle is  louder  a high-pitched scream
No, Momma
Don't you lie to me, Carietta, don't you know by now  can see inside you
can see your sin just as surely as God can
Momma, let me go
Margaret flings open the door of the kitchen closet
We will pray
We will pray, woman, we will pray to Jesus for our woman-weak, wicked, sinning souls
She switches on the light, and there is Jesus on the wall, rictus, crown of thorns, bathed in an ominous blue light
vision of a wrathful God
Throughout the following, Carrie struggles desperately, but she's no match for her mother
32 And the Lord visited Eve with a Curse, and the Curse was the Curse of Blood
And there was a Second Curse, and this was the Curse of Childbearing, and Eve brought forth Cain in sweat and blood
She propels Carrie into the closet, slams the door behind her
Margaret's voice continues, overlapping onto: 79 Very much the little girl now as she sinks to the floor of the closet  crying, disheveled, beaten
The closet is just what every child ever dreaded about the night
80 Looking down at Carrie
81 She looks away  and inwards
With her, we see: 82 Falling on the shower floor
83 Surrounding Carrie, jeering her, bombarding her
84 Impassive, impersonal, unconcerned  or so it seems
85 In the forefront of the pack
86 As the girls would see her, cowering, the bloody napkins pelting her
87 The blood seems to be streaming down his face; it moves
33 88 Tears are streaming down her face
She whispers: Please
: 89 on Tommy Ross' 1963 Ford, which is parked in the shadows on The Hill (something of a ridge which overlooks the town and is dedicated to Eros by high school students and occasional graduates)
The  swells as we
And finally, we into the car, where we see: 90
' Sue and Tommy have finished making love in the back seat
They are both putting their clothes in order, silently, slowly
Then they climb into the front seat
Sue takes out a cigarette
Tommy lights it with the dashboard lighter
They say nothing as Sue smokes for a few moments
Then Tommy looks at her closely
Hey
She turns away
Hey, what's the matter
He puts his arm around her clumsily
Nothing
What did  do
Nothing
It's not you
34 Hey, everything's all right
love you, honey
(silence) Did
(blurting) It's Carrie
Who
Carrie
Carrie White
Praying Carrie
(sharply) Don't call her that
(imitating Carrie) It's
beautiful
(laughing) That's what she said when  read that poem you wrote for me
Tommy, please
(going on) And Big Belly Fromm saying
(imitating) That isn't exactly criticism, Miss White
(exploding) Jesus
Sue has turned away from him
Hey, honey, it was a beautiful poem
wish  could have written it
(silence) Honey
35 Don't call me that
Don't call her that
Don't call me that
What the hell's the matter with you
She is crying, that's what
Hey, are you crying
(yes, stupid) Are you
He tries to turn her toward him
She struggles
Manfully, he forces her around
Jesus, Sue, what is it
(trying to turn away) told you
Told me what
About Carrie
That thing in the shower
(she's silent) Hey, it was a joke, wasn't it
mean, everyone was doing it
'm not everyone
You're special
was one of them
So you were teasing Carrie White 36 We were hurting her She's used to it
Jesus, you remember how she'd get down on her knees and say grace in the cafeteria
alone, for Christ's sake
And the way she dresses
Hey, Sue, she's asking for it
(vehemently) How would you like to be Carrie White
How would  like to be Carrie White
How would you like to be Carrie White
How would you like to be Carrie White instead of being Tommy Ross
big man, big jock, popular
What's the big deal about being popular
mean, one day 'll wake up and find myself working at my dad's car lot and out Friday nights and Saturdays at Uncle Billy's or the Cavalier drinking beer and maybe married with a bunch of kids
(stops) What's that got to do with Carrie White
Or anything
did something wrong and  feel bad about it
can understand that
Hey, back in seventh grade, there was this kid
(interrupting) 've got to do something about it
Like what
don't know yet
Apologize
Okay, you tell her you're sorry
37 That's not enough
That's like something my mom would do
What are you going to do
Kiss her, for God's sake
God,  hate you sometimes
What the hell do you want me to do
want you to help me
Or are you just interested in fucking me
(angrily) Don't say that
Fucking me, fucking me
Cut it out
Then help me
Tommy moves back from Sue
He is looking at her, trying to figure her out
He wants to do something, he doesn't want an argument, but
Okay, what can  do
want you to think about Carrie White
38 (incredulously) You want me to sit here and think about
Jesus
(moment) Are you serious
(moment) You're serious
(moment) What's there to think about
Think about it
Jesus
He stares off through the windshield
He is really puzzled
He steals a look at Sue
He starts to put his arm around her; she moves a little, subtly but clearly
Tommy stares off into space again
never thought about her
mean, she wasn't someone you had to think about
(beat) She was always there  keeping to herself in that stupid dress  that weird mother
(beat) You know what  mean
Sue glances toward him
Of course she knows
And he is beginning to understand
Tommy looks straight ahead again
He is starting to think
It's not all that easy
(almost under his breath) Carrie White
It does come out as a question
: 39 91 Margaret is at the sewing machine
She is either listening to a reasonable facsimile of Kathryn Kuhlman preaching on the radio, or instead, to an old Victrola which plays Tennessee Ernie Ford's "Let the Lower Lights Be Burning
"  Black Forest cuckoo clock, providing a sense of lapsed time
Suddenly the treadle on the sewing machine depresses itself
The needle begins to dip up and down; the bobbin whirs and jerks
Margaret turns around to see: 92 She is standing in the entrance of the living room
Her demeanor seems more peaceful, calm, almost too calm
93 touch of fear in her eyes
But: Go to bed
94 She crosses over to her mother, kisses her lightly on the (unmoving) head
Good night, Momma
Carrie goes to the stairs
95 With Carrie
96 Carrie goes into her room
40 97
' Carrie turns on a light
She undresses slowly, wearily
And then she stops and looks at herself in the mirror
close, tired inspection
Her eyes seem hollow, haunted
Carrie doesn't like what she sees; she doesn't like herself
Flex
Slowly cracks appear in the mirror, spiderwebs
Flex
The mirror cracks wider
And flex: the mirror shatters, crashes to the dresser in pieces, loudly; some of the pieces fall on the floor
Carrie
Carrie
Carrie
moment of utter panic  now what
98 As Margaret strides up them, past the landing, and tries the knob on Carrie's door
It's locked
She rattles the knob
But to no avail
Then: Carrie
Carrie, open this door
(a beat; nothing) Carrie
Another beat; then: ' (sweetly) It's open, Momma
Margaret tries the knob again, and it is, indeed, open
99  ' Where Carrie is kneeling by her bed, now in her flannel nightgown, praying
What was that noise
41 Nothing, Momma
Margaret peers around the room; she did hear a mirror break, no mistake about it
But there it is  whole again as her reflection in it testifies
Margaret walks over to it, rearranges the plastic glow-in-the-dark Madonna and child on the dresser
Go to bed
She leaves the doorway and we return to Carrie, who smiles sweetly
And then: Flex
The door slams closed
100 Down the class of twenty-five or so girls, still in their street clothes, lined up against the gym wall under their class numbers as: 101 Walks in front of them with a clipboard taking roll
Collins Shyres
(o
s
) Present Snell
102 ,  Sue Here
(o
s
) Watson
Present
42 The   to an empty space  without being told, we can tell it's Carrie's
103 Hesitates, then moves right along
and the Wilsons
Who're identical twins
Here
Miss Collins
(small smile; then, closing her book) Okay
Sit down
All the girls  except Chris  obey
You too, Chris
And spit out that gum
(overly sweet) Where'll  put it, Miss Collins
You can choke on it for all  care
Now sit down
104 Pausing for a second, then deciding it's better to go along without talking back
She sits down
105 Shifting nervously, unused to Collins' absolute no-nonsense tone
106 Taking a deep breath
43 Okay
just want you all to know that you did a shitty thing yesterday
really shitty thing
107 the freckled, slightly pudgy girl sitting next to Sue  giggles nervously
But no one joins her, and she clasps her hand over her mouth, trying to stifle it
108 Glaring at Helen, silencing her
Did any of you stop to think that Carrie White has feelings
Do any of you ever stop to think
No,  guess you've got your minds on your dates and the Prom
Chris,  imagine you can take your pick, who's the lucky guy
(mumbling) Billy Nolan
(loudly) Who
Speak up
can't hear you
Chris tries to control her anger  is barely able to
Billy Nolan Collins  eye-to-eye with Chris now, smiles
Well, isn't he the lucky one
She walks down the line, stopping in front of Sue
And what about you, Sue
Who's taking you
Tommy Ross
44 Right (beat; then) Okay
Now my idea for this little trick you pulled was three days' suspension and refusal of your prom tickets
109 As Collins' words sink in  groans of disappointment
110 ' Almost seeming o single Sue out as she continues  at least that's the way it seems to Sue
That would hit you where you live, now, wouldn't it
And you'd deserve it   don't think any of you have any idea of just how nasty what you did was
The office has decided that you're to have one week's detention
The girls sigh with relief
Chris has a particularly smug look
Collins takes in their reactions; then she reels in the line: But
There's one little catch
It's to be my detention
Right here in the gym
Fifty minutes every day
Get the picture
111 As they realize just how they've been had  indeed, getting the picture
112 Furious, defiant
won't come
113 No less determined, but cool
45 That's up to you, Chris
That's up to all of you
Punishment for skipping detention is three days' suspension and the loss of your prom tickets
Any other thoughts
114 Sober, slightly frightened
115 She is standing in the hall, looking into the gym through the small glass window cut in the door
116 Collins has finished with the girls, she stands in front of them, the victor
Right
Now change up
The girls start to turn
117 Carrie quickly pulls away from the door before she can be seen, hastens away
118 Collins watches the girls filing into the locker room, a small triumphant smile on her face
119 Carrie is now far down the hall, a small distant figure
Now she goes out of sight around a corner
The hall is empty and still; , then: : 120 As the girls change silently into their green gym outfits  quiet, subdued, most of them resigned to their punishment
Chris, however, is about to blow up; she tosses her skirt into her locker and slams the door shut
: 46 121 And then another, and another, and yet another flipping by us, one title following another as Carrie looms over the card catalog, searching
The title cards include , and   on this latter card, it reads: " ghost supposed to be responsible for table rappings and other mysterious, noisy disturbances
" It also contains a cross-reference see tele  and the rest of the word is blurred
121A Her face  curious, deciding to follow it up
121B As Carrie flips through the "" card catalog  passing everything from Talmud to Tarantula until she gets to: 121C On the word, and below it: `Thought to be the ability to move or to cause changes in objects by force of the mind, perhaps a genetic-recessive in origin
' 121D Her mind struggling with the words on the card, pondering, thoughtful
Her heart starts to beat
122 On the girls, all of them in the green gym suits, being run ragged, just as Collins promised
She's pushing them extremely hard, barking orders at them, using her whistle like a drill instructor
123 As she runs to position herself next to Sue
She can't get away with this
'm going to get her
That goddamn snerd Let it go, Chris
47 And Sue runs on, leaving Chris  red in the face, breathless, furious  behind
Chris deliberately slows down and then just halts
The period's not up, Hargensen
It is for me
There are ten minutes left
Stick them up your ass
Chris starts to stalk past Collins who reaches out and firmly pushes her back
Chris becomes immediately hysterical
You can't hit us
You'll get canned for this, you bitch
My father One more word from you and 'll throw you across the room
Want to see if 'm telling the truth
124 Appealing to the others now; flailing, out of control
She can't get away with this
Goddammit
If we all stick together, we can 125 As Chris looks to them for support, none of them quite knowing what to do
Norma
Helen
Sue
48 126 Featuring Chris and Sue (lifeless) Shut up, Chris
Just shut up
127 mutineer without a single ally now
She realizes it and heads for the door leading to the locker room, and this time, Collins doesn't even try to stop her
At the door: This isn't over
This isn't over by a long shot
The door slams shut, leaving the girls and Collins frozen by Chris's outburst
The gives a shrill , and we: : 128 The local after-school hangout
Clusters of students milling in and around booths
Pinball machines, a jukebox thumping "   " by Martha Reeves and the Vandellas
Sue is sitting, reading, alone in one of the booths as Chris enters, says hello to some of her clique, and spots her
Hey, Sue
Just who 've been looking for
Sue looks up and tries to force her face into a smile
Chris slides into the booth across from her and thrusts her John
Kennedy school yearbook across the table  an action which Sue involuntarily jerks away from out of nervousness
(continuing) wanted you to sign my yearbook
Hey, where's you old man, did he stand you up
(busying herself with the yearbook) Still at practice 49 Well,  guess you've heard 'm out of the prom
bet that cocksucker Morton loses his job, though
Daddy's suing them
Hey, Billee
Billee
Come over and say hi to Sue
Sue slides the yearbook back across the table to Chris, who examines it: (continuing) Hey, is that it
Just Sue Snell
Billy goons   next to Chris, glomming his arm around her neck
Hey, Suze
think we're going anyway, right, Billee
Sure thing, Charlie
Chris playfully jabs him in the ribs
You mean crash
Sure, why not
Hey, listen, 've got a good one
"Roses are red, violets are blue, sugar is sweet, but Carrie White eats shit
" Billy, goon that he is, cracks up
Sue finds it not at all funny, but doesn't know exactly what to do about what she's feeling
Chris, 've got to go
new tune comes on the juke  Shirley and Company whooping it up on ", , " (oblivious, her laughter turning to fury) That goddamn Carrie
If only the rest of you had walked out with me
Jesus, Sue, why didn't you
50 took the detention because  thought we    earned it
It was a shitty thing to have done
End of statement
Bullshit
That goddamn snerd and her batshit mother  saying we're all going to hell
(rising) What'd she ever do to you, Chris
Or to any of us
Why do you hate her so much
Hey, hey
tell me if 'm wrong, but who was that n there pitching with the rest of us
Me
(it comes out a pinched nerve) Me
But  stopped
(dawning on her; getting it finally) Oh
Oh, aren't you just it
Oh, my, yes
(imitating; prissy) You stopped
Hey, Billee, she stopped
Sue is scared now  she hears it coming
There's no question about it, though; the rumbles have already begun, and there's no stopping what's coming
(continuing) God, 'm dumb sometimes
Billee, hey, Billee, do you want to know why Suze here didn't walk out
Billy's over by the pinball machines with some of his goon squad
He boastfully struts around  much to their obvious delight  making the sound of a chicken in reply
129 Seeing this; feeling it all about to lurch out of control and turn against her
The bottom's falling out
51 'll see you around, Chris
130 Chris prominently  a bloodhound now sure of the scent
No
Wait
You stopped, remember
So just stop again
(uglier) Why didn't you walk out
Why didn't you walk out, Sue
Okay, Chris
That's enough
You didn't walk out, Sue
little Suze
little Suzy Creamcheese
because you didn't want to miss a moment of your precious prom
Bulls-eye
Sue fights back the tears and fury, trembling now
But she tries to muster up some dignity
And you don't
(not about to be put off) You're goddamn right,  don't
But we're on your case now
(beat) 'll bet you've got your dress all picked out, too
What color is it
Yellowguts
She's about to break, holding it in as best she can
Chris just as quickly as she spots the weakness, shuts it off, bottling up all the rage into he cruelest stainless-steel smile she can muster
(continuing) Okay
(dismissively) See you around, Sue
And that's it  shut up, shut down, shut out
52 Sue turns and starts to walk out of the Cavalier
In the background behind her, it's all out of focus, an incoherent babble of snickering and clucking laughter
She's crossed the line
: 131 Sue sits in the bleachers overlooking the field
She is preoccupied, still shaken by the afternoon's confrontation with Chris
The track team is moving past the bleachers (a coach in the field clocking them and shouting orders)
Tommy, in his track uniform, peels away from the group and comes running up to Sue
Hi
want to talk to you
Sure, what's up
To avoid the noise of the cheerleaders practicing down in front of them, and the other girls sitting in the bleachers half watching their boyfriends and half eyeing Tommy and Sue, Sue beckons Tommy to follow her away from the group behind the bleachers, and as they walk off together we hear the following: If  asked you to do something for me  something special  would you
(nodding) Uh-huh
No matter how crazy it sounded
Sure
What
The sound is muffled, and we don't hear what she says
But we do hear: (continuing; exploding) Are you out of your mind
53 : 132 big hangout-cruising night on the boulevard
Neon, convertibles, "Rebel Without a Cause" meets "American Graffiti" seventies-style
In other words, the works -- with
133 As a '61 Chevy leaves a sizeable patch of rubber on the street as it  to a hard stop, just barely halting before it almost went through a red light and collided with the traffic already in the intersection
134 which belongs to the aforementioned    a character whose life and brains stopped around the time he saw "Rebel" on television
He's Chris's boyfriend, and a huge cross swings around his neck
Right now, he's utterly amused by his harrowing driving, and turns to Chris who ignores him, still brooding over her afternoon losses
Billy takes a huge toke from a joint and hands it to her; she ignores that too, and proceeds to busy herself applying makeup in the visor window
So Billy looks out his window and strikes up some banter with a fellow cruiser idling beside them at the light
The light changes, and Billy peels out  an action with throws Chris backwards onto the seat
Goddamnit, Billy
He just laughs as he weaves through traffic
(continuing) Slow down
(as he pays no heed) Slow down, you stupid shit
Scared, Chuckie
No
You'll kill us, you stupid shit
Billy lazily slaps her, speeds up
54 Don't call me that
Stupid shit
He slaps her again
(continuing; under her breath) Stupid shit
(disgustedly) Oh wow
He slams on the brakes, and pulls into: 135
' (
) on a parking lot where cars are parked; a huge pullman's car which has been converted into a restaurant
This after-school hangout is called the Cavalier
136 As Billy reaches over, very confidently, to draw Chris to him
She lets herself be kissed, then pulls away abruptly
He grabs at her, and she pulls away
What's wrong
Can't you wait a minute
What for
You're so ignorant
That's what you like
55 Bullshit
No
'll show you what you like, Chuckie
Grab
No
Jesus
Grab
No
She pushes him away
He grabs her
She pushes; he grabs
struggle
Grabs at her tit
There goes the blouse; the buttons are ripped off
How you
gonna
explain that
Dumb shit
He slaps her
What'd  tell you
Silence
Then, after some time, he leans over and kisses her
She lets him
He kisses her again, and she responds
He goes at it
And she squirms away
(continuing) Hell is this
want you to do something
56 | What
(eagerly) Yeah, what
want you to do something for me
Something important
(warily) Something important
It will be very important to me
It will make me feel very good if you do it
She moves closer to him
Her hand dips down out of
She blows in his ear
Billy is beginning to writhe; he moves in on her, but she holds him off, playing him like a puppet
(continuing) Billy,  hate Carrie White
: 137 On which we see the opening, helicopter-credit-sequence from "Duel at Diablo
" The television is in: 138 Where the movie's  continues uninterrupted for a bit over an incredible silence between Tommy and Sue
They are sitting on a couch
The silence is finally broken by a reluctant: Okay
'll do it
And we: : 57 139 Margaret slowly opens the door to Carrie's room and enters
Light filters in from the street
Carrie is lying in bed, motionless, asleep
Margaret crosses the room quietly
She leans over the bed
On the table next to it is the glow-in-the-dark statue  not in its usual place on the dresser
Carrie's face, in the soft light, seems very innocent
(low) Carrie, did you pray
No answer
Margaret bends over Carrie
And with surprising tenderness, she kisses Carrie's forehead
The she straightens up quickly, as though she has violated herself, and leaves the room
Carrie opens her eyes
She pulls a book out from under the covers; then she stares at the Madonna-child figurine, it begins to glow brighter and brighter, illuminating the room
It's bright enough to read by now, and we leave Carrie expanding her education and: : 140 As Carrie examines a shelf of books with titles like "Cosmic Consciousness" and
Ogilve's "Hidden Powers of the Mind
" She decides on the latter just as a voice startles her: ' Carrie
Ohuh
She stares at him and quickly covers the binding of the book with her hand, covering the title
He looks as startled as she does
How're you doing
(after a beat; almost inaudibly) Okay
58 It's harder than he thought it would be; just trying to make small talk is agonizing
But try it, he does: thought you had gym this period
All she can do is shake her head
And a young man not easily deterred, he tries again
(continuing) What're you reading
(trying to cover, and not very well) It's about
um
sewing
Right
Check and stalemate
Which brings him to: Umm
if you don't have a date for the Prom, would you want to go with me
What
The Prom
Without saying a word, Carrie walks down the aisle of book shelves
He follows her into the main room where students are reading, working
(continuing) It's next Friday, and  know this is later notice, but they stop selling tickets soon, and The bell
don't like to be tricked
couple of students stare at Tommy talking to Carrie as they start leaving the library
Carrie
59 But it's too late  she's gone, already out the door
: 141 As Tommy weaves through the crowd after her
Gangly   spots him: Hey, Ross
But Tommy ignores him in his singular pursuit
Hey, Carrie
Wait
couple of other students watch this  is this their Tommy Ross actually trying to speak with Carrie
But he's oblivious of any looks now, any snickering  all he wants is to catch up with Carrie
Which he does; he manages to touch her arm, and it's a weird moment, this contact
She turns around, her head painfully ducked down
(continuing) Hey, it's no big deal
And she looks up and stares at him with that peculiar intensity that cuts through all the clamor around them
Quiet, quietly: Do you people think you can just go on tricking me forever
beat
Tommy stands there helpless, sensing just how much of a big deal it is
Seeing that she's on the verge of tears, he's feeling even worse, and all he can say is: Sorry
But it's too little, and too late
She's crying
And what's more, she's gone  swallowed up into the clamor of students rushing to beat the bell
Which  as we: : 60 142
' As Collins tidies up after one of the classes  throwing towels into huge cans, etc
Only to hear a mewing, whimpering sound and come upon Carrie who's huddled in one of the dark corners of the room, crying
It's almost as if she created her own closet of space
Carrie
(on no response) Carrie, what's the matter
(on still no response) Was it one of the girls
Did one of the girls do something to you
Do you want a Kleenex
No
It's all right
Just tell me, there's nothing to be afraid of
Miss Collins
That's it
When can  come back to gym
Not until Monday
Now what is it
Are you going to tell me
Come on, Carrie, tell me
got asked to the prom
That's great
Tommy Ross asked me
Tommy Ross  that's wonderful
He's cute
61 know who he goes around with
They're trying to trick me again
know
Maybe he really meant it
mean, maybe he really did mean it
Maybe you should think about it
It might be really fun
You might have a really good time
It would be a nightmare
'mon, Carrie
You should have a better image of yourself
You just think you're unattractive, but look at your hair
It's really beautiful
If you just fixed it up a little
here, 'll show you
: 143 144 where Collins and Morton are grabbing a quick cup of coffee
Carrie's been asked to the prom
Who
Carrie White
By whom
The Beak
By Tommy Ross
Morton goes into a coughing fit, accidentally knocking over his coffee in the process
Collins watches, slightly amused by his reaction
When he recovers: What about his girlfriend
Doesn't he date the little Snell girl
62 think she put him up to it
145 Where Collins is grilling a very nervous Sue  just Sue so far
Who's brainstorm was this
(no response) What are you trying to do
You've got it wrong
hope so
wouldn't have expected this from you, Sue
Not any of it
Well
What do you want to know
Why Tommy asked her to the prom
(after a beat) Well
(reluctant; able to go this far) asked him to
Why
(swallowing) asked him to
But, in God's name, what for
What could you possibly have in mind
146 Who's also in the office for this interrogation  ill at ease, trying to appear cool
63 You mean what good would it do
Maybe it'll
bring her out of
make her a
part of things
Oh, come on, Sue
None of us are that stupid
And neither is Carrie
Maybe not
And you're not going to go
You're going to stay home and miss your senior prom
Just as this point,    a prissy little pleaser with a mouth whose verbal discretion could make the telephone obsolete  enters the room with a sheaf of attendance sheets for the next week
All conversation ceases
(continuing) Yes, Norma
What is it
Just the attendance sheets, Miss Collins
Just leave them on the desk
(to Sue) You understand, you can't come without a date
Sue understands perfectly well, but with Norma there, she's not about to say a word
And Collins finally picks up on this: (continuing) Is there something else, Norma
(butter could melt) No, Miss Collins
And she exits as slowly as she can  trying to hear the last possible word
Then: 64 (to Tommy) Which brings us to you
Miss Collins,  have to get to practice
That's too bad
Look, this is between Sue and me
If you don't mind
Oh, but  do
Or would you rather we continue this discussion in Mr
Morton's office
(bluffed; then off-handedly  like we first saw him in Fromm's class) What's the big deal
Because it's a very big deal for Carrie White
And you know it
Anyway, she's already said no
You can make her change her mind
Don't overrate me
Just don't try
Okay
It's not okay
(to Collins) You can't order anyone not to take someone to the prom
65 can make sure you don't hurt Carrie
We're not trying to hurt her
We're trying to help her
How
Silence
(continuing) Tommy, when you come to the prom with Carrie White, don't you think you'll look a little ridiculous
Well
We don't care how we look
Sue looks over at Tommy
(continuing) Do we
Tommy says nothing; he's caught between a rock and a hard place
: 147 As Tommy's Volkswagen parks across the street, Tommy gets out and approaches the White house
Carrie is inside, watching him come up the stairs
She remains on the hall side of the screen door
So this is where you live
What
what're you doing here
66 (laughs) Aren't you going to ask me in
She shakes her head; he laughs again, a little nervously
Throughout this scene in which he remains on the porch side of the screen door, he catches glimpses of the weird house within
(continuing) Why not
Momma's resting
What do you want
Right to the point, huh
Okay, about the prom
already told you
(a little charm) Nothing to stop you changing your mind
Girls do it all the time
Why are you doing this
Hey, 'm asking you because  want to
No
Look,  don't do anything  don't want to
can't
Sure you can
In the background  in the kitchen, perhaps  Margaret calls out Carrie's name
67 Carrie glances nervously behind her; then back at Tommy
You better go
' Carrie
Who are you talking to
Don't you think you better answer
No one, Momma
You're going with me
can't
You're going
They'll laugh
No one will laugh
We'll see to it
Please
Please go
Not `til you say yes
Carrie swipes at her eyes with the back of her hand; helpless, honest, confused
She'd really like to go at this point, but that extra sense in her is resisting
Why
Why is it so important to you
don't know
Maybe it's because you liked my poem
68 (o
s
) Carietta
And in just these split seconds, she decides; had he not "liked" her poem, had Margaret not called, perhaps she could have held back
Yes
(beat) Okay
'll pick you up at eight
(whispering) Fine
(then) Thank you
Tommy smiles at her and, turning to leave, touches her hand against the screen door goodbye, nothing more
He goes down the walk toward his car
149 Watching him
She takes the hand he "touched" and brushes the hair back from her face little beautiful
You bet
' Carrie
Did you hear me
Coming, Momma
Coming
And as she turns away from the door, we: : 150 Why not
Why did you do it
God, everyone's talking
69 We   to see the gym
The entire back wall has been devoted to a giant mural of stars and planets  it seems the prom is to have a celestial theme, and the gymnasium is in the process of being hung with a great deal of crepe paper, moons, etc
asked Tommy to take Carrie
thought  owed her that much
Where does that put the rest of us
You have to make up your own mind
And Tommy went along with it
Uh-huh
(pauses) guess the other kids think 'm stuck-up
Well
they're all talking about it
But most of them still think you're okay
151 ' as thick as thieves, off in the corner, whispering

The lights are on downstairs; there's a slight drizzle and haze
, then: : 154 As Carrie and Margaret finish dinner
Silence  punctuated only by the slight outside and occasional flashes of  and lightning
Then: You haven't touched your pie, Carrie
It makes me have pimples, Momma
Your pimples are the Lord's way of chastising you
Momma
Yes
Momma, please see that  have to start to get
to try and get along with people
Whatever are you going on about
Have you been showering with the other girls again
've been invited to the prom
(a foreign language) Prom
It's next Friday, and 71 It's that teacher, the one that called
She'll be sorry
Momma, please see that 'm not like you
'm funny,  mean, the kids think 'm funny
don't want to be
want to try and be a whole person before it's too late to Margaret throws her cup of tea in Carrie's face
It's cold, wet, sticky
But Carrie holds herself in, she's going to be in charge this time
She takes a deep swallow and continues: (continuing) His name is Tommy Ross, and he's a very nice boy
He's No
-- promised to stop in and meet you before, and (overlapping) --  said no
-- have me in by midnight
've (shaking her head now; uncontrollable) No, no, no -- accepted
Pause
Margaret's shaking with fury, trembling
Carrie wipes the stringy wet hair from her forehead
(continuing) 've accepted, Momma
have accepted
72 The closet
No
After all you've been taught Everyone isn't bad, Momma, everything isn't sinful
Go to your closet and pray
Ask to be forgiven
You'll like this boy, he
And Margaret at this word shifts gears and winds up  in the grip of a weird babble
Boys
Yes, boys come next
After the blood, the boys come
Like sniffing dogs
Momma grinning and slobbering, trying to find out where the smell comes from, where the smell is
That
smell
Please stop
Yes, in cars
Yes
know where they take you in their cars
Roadhouses
Music
Whiskey
've seen it, all right
Oh, yes
Momma, you better stop
You're not going
73 've already said  would, Momma
Then say no
Say no
Or we'll move
No
We'll move from here and you'll never see that boy again
gust of wind causes the window to blow open
Margaret gets up and starts toward the window
Carrie is silent, watching herself being shut out
(continuing) The rain's coming in
Momma, sit down
'm going to close the windows
'll get them
Please sit and talk to me
No
Margaret continues toward the kitchen window to close it
Carrie knits her brow, and flex, the window closes
Margaret whips around, facing Carrie
'm going, Momma
And things are going to change around here
Flex

He ran away, Momma
Everyone knows that

The devil tempted him
He ran away with a woman, Momma
All men are the same

You can't stop me
: 155 & 156 75 157 Leading to Henty's farm
slight drizzle; or, the ground is still wet
little more than a crescent moon silhouettes a group of five: Billy and Chris in front, and Billy's twitchy zoo  a completely wrecked  , a very nervous   , and an occasionally giggling, goggled    trailing behind
De Lois is swinging a nine-pound sledge-hammer in the air; the other two goons are struggling with an ice-chest and steel pails
Henty's farmhouse and barn are in the distance
Hell of a risk for a joke
Trennant giggles inanely
Billy stops and glares at De Lois
You want out
(hastily) No, uh-uh
(then) It's a good joke, Billy
Trennant giggles again
Garson is stoned silly  zonked, deadpan
He greedily sucks the last remnants of a joint into oblivion before our eyes
De Lois angrily snatches the roach out of Garson's fingers
(continuing) Hey, piggie
Trennant just giggles inanely
Another long beat, then: (continuing) You sure Old Man Henty won't be around
76 told you
He's at a funeral
Trennant explodes into a fit of high-pitched laughter
Shut up, Henry
Whose funeral did he go to
His mother's
His mother's
Jesus Christ, she musta been older than God
Trennant lurches into another cackle
And in spite of themselves, Billy and Chris start laughing, too
Even De Lois starts laughing
The group passes a "No Trespassing" sign, prompting: (continuing) The bastard is going to shit where he stands when he comes back and gets a look
Garson drops one of the pails on the ground
Asshole
The sound of Trennant's high-pitched giggle
: 158 ' And   the harmonic chanting of De Lois, Trennant and Garson: Soo-ee, soo-ee Pig-pig-pig
Soo-ee, soo-ee Pig-pig-pig
77 And an old sleeping boar and two sows are
159 The face of five     on De Lois
Doan worry, piggies, doan worry
'm gonna bash your fuckin' heads in, and you woan have to worry `bout the bomb no more
Shut up and do it already
will,  will
'm not gonna give `em time to burp
The throat
But it's too late
De Lois has lost all conviction
can't
(then) You
He hands the sledge hammer to Billy
Chris, chilled to the bone, rubs herself to keep warm
Do it, Billy
Billy touches the ball of his thumb to the edge of the sledge hammer
(continuing) Do it quick
And Billy smiles
Yes, he actually smiles
As he raises the sledge hammer, we  : : 78 160 The sun is shining  perhaps the next day, a day later
The house is a picture postcard  under it, we hear the sweet, muffled sound of "Amazing Grace
" It's just loud enough for us to hear it  joyous, triumphant
: 160A Margaret sits beneath the plaster crucifix
The sampler, however, sits in her lap  unfinished, unminded
She's virtually catatonic
"Amazing Grace"  a sweet, contemporary rendition  is on the Webcor
pleasure after Kathryn Kuhlman
Carrie sits at the sewing machine, finishing work on the pattern for her prom dress
She removes the material from the sewing machine, which we now see is a lush crushed velvet
Red
might have known it would be red
The cuckoo clock is ,
Carrie stares at Margaret, then turns the sewing machine off
She looks back at Margaret, then turns her attention to the machine, her eyes sparkling
Courtesy of Carrie, the treadle on the machine depresses itself
The needle starts to bob up and down, up and down, up and down
, jerking
The side wheel spins
And then stops
(softly) Only clearing the thread, Momma
She smiles
Then rises and goes to start up the stairs to her room
Margaret looks after her
Hate
And fear
(abruptly) It's Satan
79 Carrie pauses
(wearily; pitying) Oh, momma
He has given you a power
Momma, it doesn't have anything to do with Satan
It's me
If concentrate hard enough,  can make things move
Satan is clever
Momma, there are other people
people with the power
It's a part of me
Satan
If it were, 'd know it
You poor child
He doesn't let you know he's working through you
Momma, 'd know
You are to renounce this power
You must give it up
You must never use it
'm going to do my homework, Momma
Another step up the stairs, stopping as Margaret hurls after her
There's going to be a judgement
There's nothing more to say
Carrie walks up to the stairs, and we: : 80 161 Very dark, shadowy, deserted
The night before the prom
Silence, then a  sound of a: 162 Being jimmied open
Behind the thick glass, we see a face  just whose isn't clear yet
The slip-lock comes free, the sill is being pushed up, and Billy's head appears
Chris is right behind him
163 As a flashlight is shined upwards  at the criss-crossing girders sheathed in crepe paper; at banks of lights which will later be used to shine down and highlight two areas in particular the huge wall mural and the chalked-in spot where the King and Queen of the Prom will be crowned
164 right behind them as they proceed toward the stage area  past the numerous tables set up for the prom-goers, past the twin bandstands
Billy is carrying the ice chest, Chris the flashlight
165 As they arrive behind the stage
Billy puts the chest down and takes out a pair of Playtex rubber gloves, snaps them on
Then he takes out two small pulleys and a coil of twine
166 ' Looking somewhat like a bizarre mountaineer, climbing a ladder which takes him up to a narrow platform overlooking the stage area
167 Shining the flashlight to guide Billy, her face flushed with excitement
168 As he disappears behind a short draw curtain which obscures the girders over the stage
169 81 unable to see him, suddenly feeling very alone
What's it like up there
(no response) Billee
(no answer; genuinely scared) Billy
And just at that moment, a piece of crepe paper floats into the  and lands in Chris's hair
She jumps, utterly unnerved
She looks up to see Billy staring down at her from the platform, grinning
Boo
You stupid shit
(still in good humor) Nice talk
Hurry up
Do you hear me, just hurry up
(blackface) Yes'um
Yes'um
Weeze doing the best we can
want to go home
Just keep your tits on and 'll let you pull it when the time comes

: 82 170 between the final arrangements for the prom itself and Carrie's preparations as the night approaches
The emphasis is on these two paralleling elements, although this montage scored throughout with happier and happier   will also feature some of our lesser characters
Among other things, we will see: )    as last-minute arrangements are made  more crepe paper hung, party favors put on tables, etc
; )   in a town store as she shops for makeup; )    under a hair dryer, her mouth going a mile a minute as a manicurist does her nails and looks utterly exhausted; )   picking out Carrie's corsage at the florist; )   at the sewing machine, finishing her dress (which we still don't see), a happy look on her face; )    as a bank of lights suddenly illuminate the mural on the stage wall; )   having dinner with her parents )    in front of their dressing tables; both of them putting on enormous fake eyelashes simultaneously; )   the class president  making sure the microphone on the stage works; )    among them, The Beak, setting up; )  , practicing her fabulous twirling baton act; )    which opens to reveal the twins in their high heels, both of them several inches taller than their depressed-looking dates; )     he in his tuxedo, she in her prom dress; a flash as Freida's parents take a Polaroid of this night to remember; )    with the adult chaperones  teachers, administrators  standing around, looking for something to do
83 It is now the night of the Prom  just minutes before it officially begins, we end this montage and: : 171
' Carrie sits in front of that same mirror, but this time, there's a different attitude
And a different girl, which pleases her
She looks different, very different, from before
She's dressed in her lush red crushed velvet prom dress, but the  is  in such a way that we don't see it
In any case, it is not prim
She is wearing some makeup
She looks
well, there has been a transformation
In the background, the door is opened by Margaret
Come in, Momma
Margaret advances into the room
Carrie opens a florist box and takes out a lovely corsage of tiny tea roses
Do you want to pin it on, Momma
can see your dirtypillows
Everyone will
Breasts, Momma, breasts
Every woman has them
Carrie's voice is calm; nothing, not even Margaret, will spoil tonight, and ever so slightly, this scene  and all that follow for a considerable period of time  has an edge of unreality to it
It's all been diffused a bit  a fairy tale through Carrie's eyes
What would look bad or tacky looks acceptable; what looked good before now looks spectacular
Take off that dress
No
84 We'll burn it together, we'll pray for forgiveness
No, Momma
The Black Forest   sings out downstairs
It's eight o'clock
He's not coming
Stop it, Momma
'm nervous enough
Margaret reaches up and pinches her cheek hard, leaving a red mark
She looks toward Carrie
Carrie is pinning the tea roses on herself
Margaret hooks her right hand into a claw, rips at her cheek, leaving a thin line of blood
Stop hurting yourself, Momma
That's not going to stop me either
Margaret strikes herself in the mouth with her fist
Go away, Momma
You know 'm right
He'll laugh at you
They'll all laugh at you
No
It'll be okay
Bur she's rattled, and nervously starts moving around a series of objects in the room
Cosmetics on the bureau, the florist box, the glow-in-the-dark statue
But it's sheer will at this point
It's after eight, and there's no sign of Tommy
It's not too late
You can stay here with me
No
85 'll answer the door and say you're sick, 'll say Momma, sit on the bed
Flex
Margaret is pushed back on the bed
Horrified, she rises again
'll say that you changed your mind, 'll say Flex
Margaret is thrust back on the bed
`Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live
' The words stop
But Margaret's eyes are fixed on Carrie, as Carrie leans toward her
Carrie's voice is soft and compassionate
You'll say nothing, Momma
You are going to have to learn that 'm not like you, not anymore
The  downstairs sounds
Carrie goes to her window and sees: 172 ' at the front door, the overhead light shining on his hair, making it glisten
He looks very handsome
173 She goes back to the bed and picks up her wrap; then, to Margaret: 'll be home early, Momma
The  downstairs sounds again
There's going to be a judgement
86 Momma, you will be quiet until 'm gone
(beat; then, at the door) love you, Momma
And she's gone, down the 174 ,  , Carrie who opens the door
175 Well, we know he's beautiful
And he's looking at Carrie
He didn't know: 176   ' He didn't know she could be beautiful
And she is
177 He reaches out his hand
Hi
Carrie takes his hand
178 Hand in hand, Carrie and Tommy walk down the path toward his car
They are observed by: 179 at the window of Carrie's room
180
' Margaret leaves the window as we  Tommy's car drive off
She goes out of the room
87 181 Down the stairs, through the dining room, into the kitchen
Almost the same path that Carrie trod, but trod so differently
While Carrie's pace had been light, nervously expectant, Margaret's is slow and heavy
182 Margaret crosses to one of the drawers
She reaches in and takes out a long carving knife; it gleams in the light
: 183 The school gymnasium is lit up brightly for the Prom; cars are pulling in, among them, Tommy's Ford
184
' as Tommy turns off the ignition
Carrie's staring at the other couples getting out of their cars
Tommy watches her taking it all in
It's like a dream
You can still change your mind, you know
She turns to him and realizes he's teasing her
Easier said than done
(grinning) 'mon
No
Please  not yet
Scared
88 Yes
(beat) Can we sit here another minute
Tommy laughs and nods
moment of silence
Carrie is miserable  she's happy to be with Tommy, she's trying to have a good time, but it's hard
It's like getting up to dance the first time
Perhaps it would be better to sit this one out
Tommy
(and then out it comes) Maybe
maybe this was a mistake
Hey, it won't be so bad
She tries to smile at him
It's not very persuasive
Really,  mean it
They're okay, you'll see
(beat; she's trying to believe him) Don't be nervous
Besides
(a little self-mocking) 'd look awfully silly dancing by myself
And that's just enough  he's taken her mind off her own fear just enough to make her laugh
: 185 where the prom is already under way, the band  an energetic version of "Harlem Nocturne
" From Carrie's  it's all magic  explosions of pastel color, everyone looking like they stepped out of an advertisement for happiness
Carrie just stands at the double-doors which are the main entrance to the gym, taking it all in as Tommy hands their tickets to ushers at the door
As Carrie stares at the giant mural on the stage wall  full of celestial moon, stars and rockets  a  bellows out behind her
Hey, Ross
Gawd, you look queer
89 186 The source of the salutation and Tommy's best friend
He bounds  , wearing a -shirt with a painted black tie under his dinner jacket
His girlfriend, Frieda Jason, tags behind
When did you come out of the treetops, Bomba
Ross, if 'd known you were going to look this good, 'd have asked you instead of Frieda
The two boys immediately go into a mock fight
Frieda comes up to Carrie
Don't let it bother you
If they destroy each other, 'll dance with you
Carrie smiles back at her nervously; there's an awkward silence
Hey, where'd you buy your dress
love it
(shyly) made it
(unaffected surprise) Made it
No shit
Carrie hesitates; realizes Frieda is quite sincere
No shit
Frieda laughs; so does Carrie, and the tension eases up
Behind them, Tommy keeps one eye on Carrie
He shrugs  it's working, goddammit  and he stuffs his hands into his dinner jacket
187 Carrie and Frieda, Tommy and George right behind them, head for their tables
90 The mural's nice
Yes
(confiding) 'm really nervous
'okay
We're sitting together
And she takes Carrie's arm
Norma Watson rushes over to them  all breathy taffeta and green chiffon
Carrie
(looking her up and down) That's a lovely dress, Carrie
Wherever did you get it
made it
Well, of course you did
can't get over it, you look so different
You're positively glowing
What's your secret
'm Don MacLean's secret lover
(a half-beat late, getting it, tittering) Don MacLean's secret
How funny you are
(cutting her) Why, hello Tommy
Aren't you excited
Cold sweat is running down my thighs in rivers
(smile slipping a full notch now) Well,  have to hurry back
Stan'll think  got lost
91 (King Kong; right on top of her) Bom-ba
(tittering, moving away smack into Frieda) And, Frieda, don't you look nice
(toothpaste smile) Get douched, Norma

George suddenly comes to life
Viiibes
He grabs Frieda, and they make their way out onto the dance floor, Frieda shrugging helplessly at Carrie
They're nice
George is funny
92 He's a good guy
(beat) See, didn't  tell you
(beat) Sure you don't want to dance
Could we just sit here for a minute
Tommy nods  it's okay with him
Carrie
Carrie turns around and finds herself facing Collins  dressed up, looking more like one of the students than a teacher
You look very pretty, Miss Collins
Thank you (beat) You too
Beautiful
It's awfully nice of you to say so
know 'm not
not really
but thank you anyway
Tommy  feeling like a fifth wheel  clears his throat and stands up
`scuse me
(to Carrie) Be right back, okay
He goes off into the crowd
(gesturing to his seat) May
Carrie nods, and she sits down, pulling the chair next to her
They're virtually alone at this moment; everyone else is dancing or occupied
93 Carrie, anything that happened before
well, it's all forgotten
want you to know that
can't forget it
(beat) But it's over with
It's over
Collins smiles; she looks at the dance floor and Carrie's eyes follow hers
At this particular moment, the band is  a quiet number  slow, romantic
remember my own prom
was two inches taller than the boy went with when  was in my heels
He gave me a corsage that clashed with my gown
But it was magic
don't know why
But 've never had a date like it, ever since
Is it like that for you
It's very
nice
(smiling) Just nice
No
There's more
don't know
(hesitating; then) it's like being on Mars
You'll never forget it
think you're right
And then, on sheer impulse, Carrie reaches out and hugs her, hugs her tightly
Thank you
Have a lovely time, Carrie
94 (o
s
) Hey, what's going on here
There is Tommy, looking "stern
" (to Collins) What are you doing with my date
Girl secrets
smile at Carrie, and she goes off
Don't let me catch you hugging any guys
You won't
Better not
Hey, listen, do you really have to be back so early
promised
Okay
understand
'm sorry
No, it's okay
Listen, the other kids are going over to Lewiston after the Prom (breaking in) That's okay
What is
You want to go with your friends
don't want to spoil anything
95 Hey, let me finish
What  was going to say,  mean if it'd be alright with you, what do you say we go to the Cavalier
(surprised; she'd love to) 've never been there
Hey, great
We'll have the place all to ourselves
Great
(he means it) Then it's settled
He takes her arm, turns her toward the dance floor
(holding back) Tommy
'mon
don't
can't
You can
He has his arms around her and half-spins, half tugs her out onto the floor
He is a young man of considerable confidence  the best part of his popularity  and it's a contagious trait
Gradually, Carrie gets caught up in the slow dancing, begins to follow him less and less awkwardly, begins to get less and less self-conscious, and, in short, starts to glide into her freedom
190 Tommy and Carrie dance into this corner; Carrie is a bit breathless and very happy
For some moments, Tommy keeps his arms around Carrie, looking at her
And then he leans forward, about to kiss her, impulsively
And impulsively and instinctively, she draws back
And is immediately embarrassed
Hey
96 'm sorry
It's just
No harm, no foul
They stand there for a couple of seconds
And suddenly and swiftly, Carrie kisses Tommy
It's a quick, awkward, frightened kiss bird peck
And again they stand there, until: don't know
anything
can't dance
You danced
don't even know how to
It's easy
And he kisses her
She breaks, looking up at him
Tommy
why
Why what
Why am  here
It's the prom
97 With you
Because  asked you
And
Why
Why did you
Because  wanted to
Why
Because
He pauses; he's on the edge
And steps back
you liked my poem
Only  didn't write it
Someone else did
Oh
She's puzzled
And she's about to ask something else
(quickly) Look, Carrie, we're here, we're together
and  like it, you know
mean,
But
commotion from the floor
Tommy turns
Hey, look
Carrie looks off, following his glance, at: 98 191 As the head Custodian supervises the sliding of two thrones from the wings onto pre-set marks on the stage apron
They're sheathed in white  strewn with crepe papers and flowers to match the prom's celestial theme
192 (uneasily) It's a fairy tale
(beaming; taking her arm) 'mon
He starts to lead her towards their table while: : 193 Sue Snell  unable to contain her curiosity about how all this has worked out  pulls up in one of her parents' cars, parks, and deliberates coming in
The lights of the gymnasium are glowing
While inside: 194 Class president Ernest Peterson makes his way to the microphone
He takes all this quite seriously
All right, ladies and gentlemen
Take your seats, please  it's time for the voting
This contest is an insult to women
couple of , scattered
It insults men, too
Louder , foot ,
99 (over the noise) Please take your seats
It's time to vote for the King and Queen
Several ushers go up and down the aisles, passing out ballots
195     ' as Norma Watson haughtily drops a ballot on their table in front of Tommy, another in front of George
Carrie examines the paper
Tommy
(looking up to see him smiling at her) we're on here
know
(seeing her concern) Want to decline
Do you want to
Hell, no
If you win, all you do is sit up there for the school song and one dance
And they put your picture in the yearbook so everyone can see we looked like idiots
Besides, it's the last year
Carrie looks up at the stage  at the massive thrones all in white
They're beautiful
You're beautiful
Carrie meets his eyes and blushes; it's all overwhelming her, and she has to look away  at the tiny party favor boat on the table in front of her, at the tiny pencil next to it
Who do we vote for
They're more your crowd than mine
100 Whatever you like
In fact,  don't really have a crowd
Let's vote for ourselves
To the devil with false modesty
She laughs aloud  the sound of her own laughter is so foreign to her that she claps a hand over her mouth, at her own daring
She takes the pencil and quickly circles their names  so quickly that the pencil breaks, bringing a small drop of blood to her finger
She gasps
Hurt yourself
No
(trying to smile) But  broke it and it was a souvenir
There's still your boat
(he pushes it gently toward her) Toot, toot
196 as Sue  hardly in formal attire  stares through the same small window in the gym door that Carrie stared through earlier  she stares inside as: 197 The ballots are being counted, Morton and Fish helping Ernest separate them into piles
We ought to notice either De Lois or Trennant hanging around the voting tables  perhaps Norma Watson as well
198     ' Carrie is holding Tommy's hand tightly  too tightly
Hey, hey
101 Sorry
Don't know your own strength
Whew
He sees she's taking him seriously
Sensitive to her reaction, he smiles at her
Hey, it's okay
In the background Josie and the Moonglows provide a flourish of drums
199 as Ernest walks up to the microphone and almost drops the ballots in the process
We've sort of hit a snag
Mr
Morton says this is the first time in the history of the Spring Prom that How far does he go back
1800
,
We've got a tie
Polka-dot or striped
Sixty-three votes for Frank Grier and Cora Wilson, and sixty-three votes for Tommy Ross and Carrie White
Silence, then the  begins and starts to swell as we

They're not applauding for us

' as new ballots arrive courtesy of Norma, who leans over them and whispers breathily: Good luck
As Tommy picks up the pencil, Carrie puts her hand on his
Don't
What
Don't vote for us
In for a penny, in for a pound
That's what my grandmother used to say
(swallowing) Don't
Please
Tommy hesitates for a second, seeing her face so full of premonition
Then he overcomes it, and scrawls their names on the slip of paper, folding it
For you
He hands it to Norma Watson, and it's off  spirited away, gone
104 Tonight you go first-class
Carrie stares at the receding figure of Norma as if she were the messenger of doom
: 209 Where we get a sense of exactly what Chris meant by favors as De Lois, Trennant, and a once again completely wrecked Kenny Garson plus Norma bring over more ballots
It's not exactly what one would call an honest ballot
210 as Sue manages to slip by Fromm, who's still lazily monitoring the door
She starts heading for the backstage area, trying to be as unobtrusive as possible
211 At the voting table, she spies Sue coming in, and finding it irresistible, blurts out the news, whispering to: 212 Who's just finishing the ballot counting
He looks in the direction that Norma's pointing in, seeing: 213 Going backstage, heading into the wings to watch: 214 as Ernest returns to the microphone
The  plays another
Ernest sees this as his big moment; he almost drops the ballots
He pauses for a moment, surveying the gym floor and the anxious prom-goers
An actors savoring the tension
Then he smiles, white teeth grinning: Tommy and Carrie win
By one vote
Begin 105 Silence
Everything a half-beat exaggerated, slowed
Carrie gasps inwardly; the candle in front of her blows out
Tommy grins, amused
He shrugs his shoulders at Carrie
And the applause begins  some of it, most of it, genuine, but some of it mocking too
The band launches into a rock version of "Pomp and Circumstance
" Ushers appear at Tommy and Carrie's table
George is pounding Tommy's back
An aluminum foil scepter is thrust into Tommy's hand; a robe with a fur collar is thrust over Carrie's shoulders
215 Peering out farther to get a good look
Unseen at first by her, there's a cord on the edge of the 216 Blocked by the clamor of the students, he's unable to make a straight bee-line for Sue in the wings
So he takes the long way around  back behind the stage
217 Dollying as they're led down the center aisle; past a blur of smiling faces, the They're being led toward the stage area  the thrones waiting for them
The lights get brighter; the  gets louder
218 As they pass by
The Beak winds conspiratorially at Carrie
219 as Tommy gives Carrie his hand, helping her up the steps, over tangles of black power cables
220 Where we finally reveal just where Chris and Billy have been hiding all this time
Chris listens to the footsteps (of Carrie and Tommy) coming overhead; grasping the cord that Billy has hooked up, holding it very tightly
106 221 as they're helped into the massive thrones; behind them is the huge mural of stars and ships
222 the showman now,
Barnum in all of his expansiveness
223 In the wings, watching this action
In the corner of the , the cord we glimpsed earlier the same one which Chris clutched beneath the stage  jiggles, and Sue notices it move
She traces its path with her eyes, seeing that it goes up to: 224 Concealing a single silver bucket; meanwhile: 225 Staring down at the gym floor; the lights are searing  so hot and bright that it's impossible to see clearly, and a new set of spotlights being shone on Tommy and her only makes it harder
226 as a piece of crepe paper lands in her hair
227 sea of faces, the spectrum of reactions
228 spreading his arms; a politician
Ladies and gentlemen,  give you he King and Queen of the Spring Prom
The Band starts playing the school , and we
: 107 229 The implications of the cord and bucket positioned over the throne just starting to dawn on her as everyone begins singing the school song: (o
s
) All rise for the John
Kennedy Hiyyyyh
And a hand comes into , clutching Sue's wrist
It belongs to: What're you doing here, young lady
(trying to head for cord under stage) Something's wrong
(o
s
) We'll raise your banner to the skyyyyh
But Morton has no interest in what Sue is trying to tell him: 'll say there is
230    ' From the throne, she sees Sue  and Morton and he pulls her toward the back exit
231 Chris is almost hyperventilating as the school song continues
What's the matter with you
Pull it
Chris is frozen  immobilized, terrified
232 ' As Morton firmly pushes Sue out the rear gym door
The door shuts, and as it closes: 233 Confused, wondering what's happening in the glare of lights and noise
108 234 locked out by Morton, trying to get back in
The door won't open
She debates going to try another door
235 as the song reaches its crescendo: (o
s
) With pride we wear the red and whyyyte
(leering) It can stay there until hell freezes over, Chuckie
Chris shudders involuntarily at the mention of this nickname
She violently jerks the cord with both hands, yanking it
sound  half-scream, half-moan  comes from her mouth, overlapping into: 237 high above the stage, slowly tipping over, the blood pouring from it
238 almost proscenium-like in this , from all the way in the back of the gym
Carrie and Tommy sit on their huge thrones as the buckets above them deposit their contents on top of them
239 The blood splashing down
240 Some of it splattering on the celestial cyclorama, running downward, streaking
241 As more blood splatters them in their white dinner jackets, the  halting
109 242 End
Tommy and Carrie, drenched with blood
243 Preparing to leave now that their mission has been accomplished, just about to crawl out as they spot: 244     ' realizing they'll have to stay put  trapped now
(panicky) Billee
(nervous too, hissing) Shut up
They crawl back under the stage, out of sight
245 As the singing stops, the students staring at the stage
246 Her eyes tightly clenched shut, looking as if she's been dipped in a bucket of red paint
She's gotten the worst of it
247 dangling on the pulleys over the throne, clanging back and forth
high-pitched ' 248 Splattered with blood
Below them, the sounds of hysteria begin ("My God, that's blood
") Tommy starts toward Carrie just as: 110 249 As the bucket falls and hits Tommy on the head; it knocks him unconscious, and he slumps to the floor
250 Watching this in pure horror
She starts to giggle uncontrollably, the kind of hysterical laugh that comes out of pure terror
It overlaps onto: 251     () As the hysteria begins to spread
252 as she starts toward the unconscious Tommy
253 as more of them start laughing
the sound of it becoming contagious
254 hearing the dreaded laughter
255 ' Through the harsh glare of the lights  laughing, pointing (see Norma Watson), doubling up in hysteria, utterly out of control
256 , , Laughing
256A reacting to their "success
" 257 Putting her hands to her blood-covered face, slowly getting to her feet
258 111 As Carrie makes her way to the stairs, tripping over the black power cords
horrified Collins is on her way up the stairs
Oh, Carrie  let me help you
Carrie hesitates at the sight of the teacher
But it's too late for help, and in the fastest flex we've seen to date, she jerks her head and Collins bounces backward  down the stairs, slamming into a wall
259 Laughing harder now, unable to stop
260 Where all is pandemonium
Morton makes his way to Collins, giving her his handkerchief; she has a bloody nose
(to Morton) Call the police
261 Tears streaming down her face, the blood streaking, as she takes in the sight of her tormentors
262 Helen Shyres is still laughing so hard that she's about to throw up or go into shock
George Dawson has climbed on the stage and is hunched over the slumped figure of Tommy Ross, examining him
Call a doctor
Hey, call a doctor, quick
He tries to pick Tommy up, and in the process the throne topples over on the stage
263 Frantic, rushing back into the school and down the hall toward the prom doors
112 264 Takes a deep breath, mustering her energy
She closes her eyes and sees: 265 All of them open, a few students milling around them as
266 Closes her eyes even tighter and flexes
And  in  : 267 slam shut
In the process, several things are accomplished at once
The prom-goers are trapped inside, and one or two of them get their hands or legs caught in the doors as they close, screaming with surprise and pain
268 who once again was just a little late, arriving just as the   ; she sees the screaming prom-goers unlucky enough to have been caught in the doors
269 Utter pandemonium as students rush toward the doors
270 Near the bandstand area, looking up at the stage and realizing that it's Carrie who's responsible for closing the doors
It's Carrie
It's Carrie
Fromm starts heading toward the stage to get control of the microphone, to stop the panic
The kids continue rushing toward the closed doors
271 small smile at being recognized by the Beak as the one responsible, the one with the power now
It's not what she wanted, but it no longer matters
They're going to know her now and never forget her
113 272 ' Between two sets of double-doors,  a huge firehouse installed in case of an emergency
273 Seeing the hose, getting the idea
:   begin here
274 as her eyes narrow and focus on the hose, zeroing on it
275 As it starts to unwind, to unspiral into the air, starting to spray a burst of water
276 As it becomes snake-like, water springing from the nozzle
277 Cries of surprise as it begins to spray water on them, ruining their clothes
278 As the velocity of the water increases, stronger and stronger
279 Eyes gleaming, a glimmer of triumph as she concentrates and surveys 280 Like rats in a maze  a slapstick chaos as they try to get away from the animated hose
The water forces the students back from the doors, backwards toward the stage
280A As they see students propelled toward them by the hose
114 281 smile of satisfaction
For the first time, she's showing them  they're the ones being made to look foolish
She's standing on one side of the stage
283 Level-headed to the end, making his way through the pandemonium toward the stage area and the bandstand as fast as he can
284 Still controlling the hose, she spots Ernest, seeing him move toward the stage area
285 knowing somehow  with some sixth sense  that Carrie's watching him
He feverishly hurries toward the area where the band equipment is plugged in
where the high voltage cables are hooked up to the electrical current
Behind him, Fromm has reached the microphone and is trying to be heard, telling everyone to remain calm
286 Realizing just what Ernest plans to do: (gently; determined) No
And she mentally fixes on him, jerking her head just so
so 287 Is flung invisibly and forcibly away from the area by Carrie's will
288 Big belly and all, trying to steady the mike
He puts his hand on it
The water, however, has reached him, and just as he touches the mic, he's electrocuted  his arm bursting into flame, unable to let go as his body goes into an electric dance, his mouth gaping open like a fish on land
115 289 Watching this; another flex, and: 290 Is propelled backwards from the microphone; he falls backward into the cyc, his flaming arm igniting it
celestial fantasy immediately bursts into flames
It prevents any of the students from using the back exit
291 Watching, riveted with horror, some of them screaming, others frozen to the spot as the cyc Utter pandemonium
292 Her face flushed, a vein in her forehead throbs, her heart pounding
She spots: 293   - hanging over the bandstand
294 as the prom-goers press against the opaque glass, straining to get out
Fish in an aquarium
295 moving toward the dazed Ernest, who's recuperating from his bout with Carrie
296 her heart pounding like an anvil
She's staring at: 297 298 She flexes
116 299 Collins and Ernest directly below the path of the lighting bar
We see the flaming cyc on the stage collapse forward
The light bar begins to shake
Plaster drops, and the light bar just short of Collins' head  as far as its wires carry it
300 Watching all this  a giggle (or is it a sob
) emerging from deep within her
Another flex
301 starts to swing recklessly around the gym
Back and forth, back and forth  it hits the ceiling, igniting it and the decorations
Flaming stars and planets begin dropping from the ceiling
302 seeing their chance to escape while Carrie is busy with the light bar
The back door (which Sue couldn't enter from the outside, and which the cyc flames prevented any of the students on the gym floor to get to) is now free, and Billy and Chris see their chance to escape
They burst out from under the stage as: 303 Spots them
In the instant it takes her to wonder what they're doing there, it's too late
They're out the door, and there's absolutely nothing she can do
304 As it swings, catching Norma Watson in its path, casually whipping this screaming girl in her green chiffon dress back into a wall
Helen Shyres is backed into a corner, giggling with horror, in shock, utterly hysterical
Students have climbed onto the back of the bleachers, trying in vain to pry off the screens on the windows so they can escape
Morton has grabbed a chair and is trying to smash it through another of the windows
All this to no avail
End
117 305 As she makes her way down the stage stairs and out onto the floor
She spots the cord going under the stage first, and realizes just how the trick was engineered
that Billy and Chris did it
306 Moving aside as Carrie walks through them  an endless series of blurred, hysterical faces
307 As Carrie makes it to one set of double doors, flexes them open, and exits
308 As Carrie exits, the doors swinging shut
Behind her, through the windows, we see a wall of fire collapse behind her
She passes Sue in the hall who's sobbing hysterically
And as Carrie exits, Sue runs into this inferno of fire to find Tommy
And then the town
and
It overlaps onto: : 309 Carrie's on her way home
At this point, she looks less like a girl that the survivor of a grisly car accident; wet, caked with blood, eyes glistening madly, almost shapeless
She goes down a hill, and then, from: 310 as a fire truck rushes toward the school, past Carrie
And then shortly afterward, out of nowhere, Billy's Chevy  it's headlights gleaming, lurches forward; it's headed right for her
311 Turns around and sees it coming toward her
312 Chris screaming "Get her
Get her
" at the top of her lungs, Billy grinning madly behind the wheel
118 313 As the Chevy heads right for her, standing in the headlights in its path, bloated, swaying back and forth, her arms thrown out
314 Almost right on top of her
315 Flexing, averting the car just as it almost smacks into her
It just misses her
316 Billy is livid, turning around to see Carrie in the back window
Goddamnit
Billy
Shut up
Just shut up
But the car is headed for an embankment
Billy realizes this and starts pumping the brakes
But the car's accelerating, not responding to Billy's efforts to slow it down
317 Her head pounding, flexing
318 As Billy attempts to turn the wheel; it, too, has turned traitor  it won't turn
They're heading right for the embankment
Billy's eyes are bugging out, Chris is screaming as: 319 Plows smack into the embankment and rolls over several times
It then bursts into a sheet of flames
119 320 Watching this explosion turn into a conflagration
We see the fire reflected in her puffy, exhausted face  brighter and brighter as we  the sound of the  merging with , and: : 321 The house is totally dark
Not even a porch light
In the distance, perhaps, the glow from the burning gymnasium
figure is moving toward the house
It is Carrie
322 Carrie tries the front door
It is unlocked
She opens it partially
(small voice) Momma
Momma
She opens the door wider
(louder) Momma
Silence
Carrie steps inside
(louder) Momma, 'm home
Silence
Carrie closes the front door
323 With the closing of the door, Carrie turns on a light
She looks around
The house is ominously empty, ominously still
120 Silence floods back in
Carrie moves to the foot of the stairs, turning on lights as she goes
She mounts the stairs, goes along the narrow hallway to her room
324
' Carrie turns on the lights, closes the door
She stares at the Madonna-child figurine on the bureau
Then, slowly, she removes her blood-stained clothing, letting it lie in a heap
Clutching a robe, she goes into the bathroom
325 Carrie turns on the shower, waits for it to get hot
It is almost steaming as she steps in
Very carefully, Carrie scrubs herself clean
Then she steps out of the shower, dries herself off briefly, puts on her robe, and turns off the bathroom light
What's important here is this gives us time to breathe, to focus on Carrie
326
' Carrie returns to her room
She is clean now; her wet hair hangs
feeling of despair about her or perhaps she is emptied out
Carrie almost mouths: Momma
It is a little child's voice and there is no answer
She goes out into the hallway
327 Carrie goes to the head of the stairs
Once again, she mouths the words: 121 Momma
Something  a movement
An instinct
-- makes her turn
She sees: 328 Coming toward her
329 She flings out her arms and cries out: Oh, Momma
And throws herself against her mother, holds her
movement from Margaret, a quick movement, hard to define
And Carrie recoils, her hands clutching her stomach
Briefly we see the knife in Margaret's hand
Then Carrie tumbles down the stairs
330 On Carrie, lying like a broken doll, huddled at the foot of the stairs
331 Carrying the knife, she stares down the stairs
It says in the Lord's Book: `Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live
' 332 Dazed, she sees her mother coming, dimly, everything distorted
She begins to crawl backwards, her eyes always on her mother, who is slowly but inexorably coming down the stairs
And now the devil has come home
122 (whimpering) Momma, it's not right
Carrie starts crawling to the kitchen
333 Carrie crawls farther and farther from the door, until she reaches the far end of the kitchen, just as Margaret, the knife gleaming in her hand, pointed toward Carrie, reaches the bottom of the stairs and turns toward the kitchen, mumbling all the while
Carrie flexes: the kitchen door swings shut
Margaret is coming toward the kitchen
Carrie flexes again  to hold the door shut
But it's no use  Margaret is relentless now, and the door opens
She raises the knife and starts toward Carrie, the door swinging behind her
should have killed you when you were born
Momma,  love you
Please help me
Sin never dies
There's nothing else to be done
Carrie flexes, and a serving fork  dangling from a hook on the way  suddenly hurtles through the air, piercing Margaret
It is followed by another and another as a rain of instruments strikes Margaret
Margaret collapses
Carrie, horrified by what she's done, starts toward her mother
And then she and we see Sue standing in the doorway, clasping her hand to her mouth, stifling her screams
You
You tricked me
123 No
Get out
We were just trying to
Get out
And then something hits the roof, rattling
small sound
stone
Then another
Then a third
Get out
Get out
The stones are beginning to rain on the roof, like hail
Sue is rooted to the spot, terrified
Get out, get out, get out
The stones are coming down harder
All sound as one or two of them break through the roof, rattle on the floor below
stone of fairly small size crashes through into the kitchen
Carrie flexes
And Sue stumbles backwards toward the door
Flex
Sue is whipped around, as though by a great wind
124 333A Stones are crashing on the house
Sue is hurtled out of the house
334 As a couple of larger stones crash into the room, Carrie heads for the closet
335 Sue, rising from the ground, see stones crashing into the house
She begins to run away
336 Carrie walks toward the closet; the figure of Jesus is illuminated  welcoming her
She goes into the closet
She closes the door
Stones crash down, obliterating the scene
337 Sue stops running
She turns to look at the White house
338    ' The stones are flattening the house
The house is being pounded into the ground
339 Terror and disbelief
Nightmare
340 The rain of stones stops
Silence
Then the house begins to sink  slowly, slowly, slowly  into the ground
125 And the ground is swallowing up the house
And covering it until  nothing remains
Not a trace
: 341 Some time later  a week, perhaps two weeks after the nightmares of Prom Night
342 home in the course of losing its family
White sheets cover furniture
Boxes in the midst of being packed
Eleanor Snell, looking incredibly tired, is attending to the last-minute details of moving
She sorts through magazines and books, discarding some, putting others into cartons
And she comes across the religious tracts left behind by Margaret White, forgotten until now
They have a momentary hypnotic effect on her
The phone , startling her
She rushes to answer it in the kitchen, catching it on the first or second ring
(hushed voice) Hello
Oh, thank God it's you, Betty
don't think  could have handled one more reporter
(she appears to hear a noise upstairs) Just a sec, dear
(she comes into the living room and looks toward the upstairs) Sue
(a little louder) Sue
(no answer, she returns to the phone) Sorry, Betty,  just wanted to make sure the phone didn't wake her
We're all a bit edgy
(beat) Better
Sleeping too much,  guess, but Schneider says that's to be expected after what she's gone through
He says she's young enough to forget it in time
Knock wood
As Eleanor's side of the conversation continues, the camera conveys her tension
Half of her is listening and talking to Betty; the rest of her mind is on Sue upstairs
With good reason
Because: 126 343 Where the Horan house used to stand, now vacant
Strewn with beer cans, overgrown with grass and weeds and wildflowers
And a   sign
We  over next door where the White house used to stand
It, too, is vacant but utterly bald  there's been no time for anything to grow here
There is another   sign put up by Born Realty
344 looking utterly haggard and perhaps a bit on the loony side from a lack of sleep stands staring at the lot
She's standing there in her white nightgown, barefoot
345     ' as she slowly walks toward it
Underwater, almost floating
We come closer on the sign which now starts appearing a bit odder  less like a simple   sign and more like a grave marker
And when we get close enough, we see that some graffiti has been hastily scrawled in chalk on the sign: And below it, in a second vandal's handwriting, some idiot's notion of one final joke: 346 as she kneels down, putting the wreath she's carrying next to the marker
She proceeds to try to wipe off the red chalk with the palm of her hand; it smudges badly
She stares at her hand, fixating on it, remembering Carrie in the shower
Suddenly, a second hand thrusts into frame, onto her nightgown
bloody hand
hand from the Earth itself
Carrie's hand It clutches a horrified Sue by the wrist
Tightly
vice
127 Sue begins screaming uncontrollably
The hand is trying to pull her into the ground
Her screams turn into howling
: 347 Still screaming
But now in her room, waking from what is, indeed, a bad nightmare
Upright in bed, screaming her head off, her face covered with perspiration
Eleanor Snell rushes into the room to the bed, embraces her hysterical daughter
It's all right, it's all right, darling
Mother
And we come in close on Sue's stricken face as her mother holds her, calming her, cradling her
Closer still on Sue's eyes
