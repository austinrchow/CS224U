Written by Clive Barker Fade In: Scene 1 Darkness
Then, a burst of sparks from a bowl held in a scaly hand
The light shows us a mural
We start to move along the wall
First we see stars and planets, painted in a primitive, stylized fashion on bare rock
voice on the track speaks softly to us
: We did not always live in hiding
We have come to the image of a huge family tree, which springs from a single seed but divides into two separate halves
On the left, ruled by the moon, the branches blossom into extraordinary creatures
On the right, by sunlight, the branches end in ordinary human beings
Upon the word Nightbreed the title comes up on the screen, against the image of a moon painted on the wall
2-2K Deleted 2L Cut to a real moon
Then cut wide to a moonlit landscape, through which the camera careens madly
The soundtrack, which was lush and almost sacred in the mural chamber, erupts into a tribal rhythm
We glimpse creatures in the darkness, moving through the reeds
They are barely more than silhouettes
We see teeth, and gleaming eyes; glimpses of naked, patterned flesh
Only glimpses
2M Cut back to the mural chamber
Now we have moved away from the tree to a more brutal scene
symbolic representation of a great apocalyptic war between Naturals and Breed
Terrible scenes of destruction
: But the Naturals made war on us
They feared us for our strength
They envied our powers
They called us monsters, killing us by whatever means their malice could invent, finding in each of us our particular vulnerability
We are scanning scenes of that war
breed being staked like a vampire
Another being shot like a werewolf
Another exposed to sunlight
: None of us was safe
The tribes of the moon dwindled
Our gods were slaughtered, our homes destroyed
It was the Apocalypse
2N Cut back to the landscape
The clouds roil above the heads of the creatures heading through the reeds
We see their destination now huge wall, with gates
2P And back to the mural chamber, and a final scene
The gates we've just seen are in the painting
Looking over them, calling the Breed in, is a vast indistinct form: that of Baphomet
His eyes burn; his arms are open in welcome
: Only one of our Gods survived the holocaust
Baphomet
Wounded and near death, he summoned us, the last of the last, into hiding
Into Midian, where we wait now
The battle is over but not the war
There will come a saviour
Now we've moved beyond the image of the gate into a new patch of wall on which the pictures are only vague sketches
We can interpret some of the images nevertheless: a man with a bloody hole in the middle of his chest
man wearing a mask like a skull
We linger on a faceless figure
: His name is Cabal
He will lead and give us back the Night
We are the tribes of the moon
We are the Nightbreed
The titles end
2Q Cut back to the landscape
Now we are at the gates, and the creatures slip through and away into the mist
Only one, a beautiful, ferocious female called Shuna Sassi remains, turning to look at us
She beckons
: Come
The camera retreats from her
: Will you not come
Now the last of the creatures, the Drummer, takes her by the arm, snatching her away through the gates
As she disappears, the camera follows again, stopping at the gates themselves, which close with an unearthly din
: 2R
' on Boone, closed eyes
He is dreaming
His gaze roves beneath his lids
Lori's lips come into shot kissing first his eyes and then traveling down his face to his mouth
: Boone
wake up
Boone's eyes flicker open
: Hi
You
Boone: Yep
Now Boone's eyes are fully open
He sits up
Looks towards the open window
Night beyond
She kisses him, distracting him from the sight of the window
: You want something to eat
: Sure
What time is it
: Nine-thirty
was letting you doze
: Thought you'd worn me out, huh
Lori smiles, and kisses him, then crosses the room to the kitchen area, picks up some fruit, and a knife, carrying both back to where Boone is lying on the bed
It is unmade
Both Lori and Boone are lightly dressed, clothes casually thrown on after an afternoon lovemaking
Lori: You know what
: What
: We should get out of Calgary for a few days
Just take off
: Anywhere special
: Somewhere we can be alone together
: More alone than this
: Yeah
Just you and me
No work
No telephone calls
No
: Bad dreams
: No bad dreams
: How did you know
:  know
always know
It's no big deal
: 'm going around in some crazy loop in my head
: You're not crazy
: No
: Say it like you mean it
:  believe it
'm not crazy
But  want this damn dream out of my head
He gets up and goes to the window
: Decker's started calling me again
: When
: All last week
Every day
: What does he want
:  don't know
haven't called him back
: If he can help, see him
Tell him it's all gone but the bad dreams
: They're not bad
That's what's weird
The more  have them the more  like them
Now  do sound like a crazy, right
: No
You sound like the man  love
little haunted, maybe, but the sanest man  ever met
: Keep going
: Will you see Decker
: You think  should
: Where's the harm
You tell him from me, 'm the only thing you should be dreaming about
:  don't think he'd get it
He never had a wet dream in his life
:  don't want to be competing with things  can't see, Boone
Can't share  don't want to be always feeling that something's pulling at you
: 'm not going anywhere, Lori
Except with you
:  can't hear that often enough
: 'll never leave you
Not ever
swear
He kisses her, passionately
: Can't remember a time when  didn't love you
: How about before we met
: Even then
They kiss again
We move past them into the darkness outside the window
Dissolve to the moon, clearing cloud
3-15 16 pleasant house in a pleasant neighborhood
Lights burn inside
17 Melissa Rickman emerges from the lounge, with a Dagwood sandwich, a work in progress
She is thirty-five, and going to seed in a gentle way
Her husband, Lou Rickman, a similar type, is planted in front of the television
: Okay, you want ham, cheese, pickle, mustard
: All of the above and a brewski, thank you
: You're getting porky, Lou
[amiable - tried to grab her]: 'm comfortable
like myself fat
like you fat too
[secretly amused - she hushes him]: Keep it down, Lou, you'll wake the munchkins
She hears something upstairs, goes to the foot of the stairs, looks up
Her eldest son, Lou Two, waddles into view
He's five
: Mommy
: Sweetie, you're supposed to be beddy-bye
:  heard something
: What did you hear
: Bad man
: No, everything's okay
You go back to bed, munchkin, 'll be up to see you in a minute
[
]: How's that sandwich coming
: Coming
Melissa disappears from the bottom of the stairs
18 Melissa enters, moves out of sight
We stay at the door
figure appears dressed in black, knives in both hands, and crosses to leave the screen again
We do not see his face
But we hear his labours: the sound of the blades slicing Melissa
She staggers into view, grabbing hold of her slit throat
Blood bubbles between her fingers
The figure appears behind her
She turns, as the knife descends
19 Lou hears a sound, rises and moves towards the kitchen door
: Melissa
At the top of the stairs, Lou Two watches wide-eyed
20 Lou Two's
- We see blood running along the highway
21 Lou reaches the kitchen door and sees Melissa laid out, dead, on the kitchen table : Oh God -
Lou enters, the figure emerges from behind him
While we remain at the door watching, detached, Lou fights back, throwing himself back and forth around the kitchen
But the figure is much stronger
We glimpse its face now, it is a mask, with a zipper for a mouth and buttons for eyes, blank
Devoid of compassion, hatred or regret death's head, made by a mad child
Atop the stairs, Lou Two listens
His baby sister cries in her cot
He looks her way then back downstairs
The sounds cease
Silence
Terror on his face
Then the child's perfect nightmare appears at the bottom of the stairs
The figure, heavy knife in hand, starts to climb, dragging Lou's bloody body after him by the hair
: 22 22A
' Empty
The phone rings
We move towards the answering machine, which clicks on
[on tape]: Hi
Please leave a message
[thru phone]: Boone, pick up will you
Boone
Are you there
Boone
Okay, so don't answer
See you tomorrow
'night
23 24 Three patrol cars, an ambulance, policeman restraining a small crowd gathered outside
n
d
sedan roars up, red bubble light flashing, and Inspector Joyce gets out and moves towards the house
He's greeted by the Medical Examiner, Dr Burton, just exiting, carrying a medical bag
[bitter]: Brace yourself, Inspector
: Same profile
: Unmistakable
Doesn't miss a trick
[anguished]: Kids
Two kids
: If it's any comfort, they went quickly
: Yeah
Makes me feel a whole lot better about the sick fuck
: Find this guy, Joyce
They say these guys want to be caught
think this one likes it too much
rookie patrolman stands on the doorstep, on the verge of tears
[gently]: Let's get these tourists back, Officer
: Yes sir
[to Burton]: If we can't protect the kids, what the hell use are we
25 26 The sun climbs above the horizon, behind the cityscape of Calgary
Another day begins
27 28 29
' Close on a pile of tapes, marked with dates over a period of two years
They're on Decker's desk
: 've been listening to the tapes of our sessions
All two years' worth
We move from the tapes to Decker, who gets up from his desk and moves around to the other side
Boone is sitting on the other side of the desk, his posture far from relaxed
He hates this room
As Decker moves, we take in the various pictures on the walls
Dance pictures, photographs of Decker with civic dignitaries, crippled children etc
: Why
: Most of my colleagues would have walked away from a case like yours
The most they would have done was drug you
But you
you intrigued me
All the talk of monsters
And Midian
Remember Midian
: That wasn't me
heard about Midian from other people
: But you made it part of your private mythology
:  suppose  did
It was a place of refuge
: When you imagined yourself being taken off to this invented city, to Midian, what crimes were you going to be forgiven
Boone's looking uneasy now
He wipes sweat from his upper lip
: You know what  used to dream
: Yes
There's a remarkable consistency in the images you see
Great detail
Almost as though the violence was real
: They were just bad dreams
Midian doesn't exist
Monsters don't exist
: But murder does, Boone
Murder's very real
It may start in the mind, but it ends up changing to flesh and blood
He picks up the envelope we saw in his previous scene, and takes the photographs out
[cont
]: Two days ago the police brought me some photographs
They wanted to know if  had any patients who might be capable of what's in these photographs
'm going to show you them
Are you ready for that
Boone nods
Decker lays the photographs on the table
Boone picks them up
We get glimpses of what they contain
Domestic horrors
Bloody scenes of corpses caught by the camera in grotesque positions, sliced up and bleeding
Boone's breath quickens
[cont
]: When you talk about murder on the tapes,  thought it was invention
Now 'm not so sure
Boone keeps staring at the pictures
The glassy eyes stare hard at him
His breathing is now rapid and shallow
One or two of the images seem to move
Bodies twitch
He drops the photographs
:  didn't
: Didn't what
: They were bad dreams
: What you describe in your sessions is very specific
Houses; faces
:  don't remember
: You want to hear
: No
Decker picks up the photographs
Boone, highly agitated, gets up and paces the room
[cont
]: You think  did this
: Six families killed over a two year period
All within driving distance of Calgary
[fury]: Do you think  did this
:  hope to God you didn't, for both our sakes
We've come a long way together
don't want to believe this any more than you do
: But you do
:  wouldn't put us through this pain if  didn't
if wasn't
afraid you had
[desperate; helpless]: What do  do
God, tell me what to do
:  can only go so far on your behalf
Patient confidentiality's one thing
Protecting a killer is another
[breaking down]: Jesus
Jesus
Jesus
Decker returns to his desk
Puts the photographs down and picks up a vial of prescription pills
He crosses to boone
: Listen to me
Take these, they'll help
Go home, and consider what we've talked about
'm going to give you twenty-four hours to go to the police and answer their questions of your own accord
That's as long as  can give you
if you haven't complied by then, 'm afraid 'll have to tell them what  know
Boone grabs the pills
[cont
]:  can't tell you how sorry  am
30 31 32, 33 34
' Boone exits into the hall, forces open the vial of pills, swallows a couple, shaking, trying to control his terror
35
' Decker sits at his desk, lifts his briefcase, opens it, tosses the folder of photographs into the case
Looking into the case he seems on the verge of some powerful emotion
Rage
Revulsion
He snaps shut the briefcase
The emotion passes
36
' Boone enters the apartment, his eyes wild
He slams the door and closes his eyes
: 36A
/' Boone studies the photographs in his hand, and they come to life
37 38 38A
' Boone opens his eyes
39 39A
' Boone chews the pills
He is now sweating and shaking violently
Boone strips off his clothes
40 40A
' Boone opens his drawers and pulls out photographs, his passport etc and starts to make a pile with them
He pours lighter fuel on the pictures, and watches them burn
Sitting against the wall still sweating he takes some more pills
We see Lori's love letters burn and hear her voice speaking the words as they are consumed
Boone cries
Then he hears Lori's voice say: : Boone
Lori is sitting on the edge of the bed
Boone looks round, sees himself against the wall and moves forward past the real Boone towards the bed
Boone watches as he and Lori make love on the bed
We close in on the love-making
Lori leans to kiss him
: 'll never leave you
Cut back to boone, his face all grief
: Stupid
: 40B
' Boone's hand pulls the shower curtain aside and turns on the water
The water pours on him
41 Another of the murder scenes comes to life
Corpses pulse with hideous animation
42
' With a cry Boone slides to the shower floor, panting, haunted, destroyed
[faintly]:
did it
did it all
43
' Behind him, the last of the fire flickers
He looks through the blinds at the sunset
Takes another pill
Puts on his leather jacket
Exits
The door slams
44 45 Lori is on stage, sexy, vivacious, fronting a tight  &  band in a hip rendition of 'Johnny Be Angry'
46 Lori's
looking though the crowd in front of the stage
Lori spots Boone standing near the entrance, his face in shadow
Her eyes light up with joy as the song builds to climax
It ends
Applause, cat whistles, foot stomping
Lori's in heaven
She looks out again
Boone is gone
47 Boone steps into view by the side of the road, watches the traffic
: 48 Confused and worried, Lori stands in the empty corridor, a note Boone has left for her in her hand
Boone edges out closer to the road
Spots a huge semi with a fully loaded trailer barrelling down towards him
Lori opens the note and reads: 'Keep this
Burn the rest
All wrong
' Tears burst from Lori's eyes
Boone flings himself in front of the oncoming truck
: : 49 blaze of light
bustling emergency receiving area
stern nurse goes through the pockets of Boone's jackets, which is lying beside him on a gurney
His eyes are closed, face and -shirt bloody
She fishes out the vial of pills
Boone moans, opens his eyes
Lucky you're in one piece, fella
[realizing where he is]:
can't even kill myself
: There's a cheerful thought
[to an approaching doctor] don't know what kind of fuel he's using, but this guy's cruising at about 35,000 feet
The doctor takes the vial of pills, checks the label
Opens Boone's eyes, shines a penlight flash on the pupils
Boone recoils
Doctor takes his pulse
: You don't hit that altitude on lithium carbonate
Let's get the prescribing doctor on the line
[finally - to Boone] Okay, we're doing all right, aren't we
Tell me, what've you been taking tonight, partner
: Lithium
The doctor opens the vial, looks at a handful of the pills
: Lithium
This isn't lithium, my friend
[to the nurse] Let's move him
Observation, let's get an , valium/saline, 200 milligrams percodan for pain, as needed
[quietly - hands the pills to the nurse] We'll have to call this in
She nods
With considerable effort, Boone sits up urgently and grabs the doctor's hand, holding the pills
: What was  taking
[patronizing]: Easy
We don't know until we run some tests
Looks like some kind of lab quality psychotropic hallucinogen
You're on what we used to call a 'bad trip' there, buddy
You relax now, you're gonna be fine
The doctor and nurse ease Boone back down onto the gurney
The doctor moves away
The nurse pulls back the curtain and rolls Boone across the hall into a semi-private room 50
- From emergency behind them, a warning buzzer sounds
[thru loudspeaker]: Code blue
Code blue
In an emergency room cubicle, a patient is having a seizure
The nurse rushes off, leaving Boone
Interns roll the cardiac cart towards the cubicle and curtains close around the scene
The door to Boone's room swings closed, shutting out the sounds
Boone exhales heavily
Closes his eyes
[
] [muttering - half mumbled ranting]: Shit
Shit
Take me, why don't you take me
Boone opens his eyes
Looks across the room at Narcisse, a wild man, half-derelict, half-punk, bloodied, his hand bandaged, pacing back and forth like a caged cat, staring out of a large picture window at the night
51 Looking in at the brightly lit window framed in the dark building, as Narcisse restlessly moves across it, peering outside
52
- [low and anxious]: They've gone, they've gone, they were here, they were coming for me, where'd they go
Shit
: Hey
[turns on him - viciously]: Shut up, shut up
They saw you, they won't come while you're here, they won't show themselves to the likes of you, don't you see that
[placating - knows the type]: Sure, okay
: Shit
've missed them, 've missed them
You scared them off, you kept them from me
Narcisse paces again, starting to sob and sniffle
Boone leans back
[cont
] [barely audible - between cries]: Midian
Midian
Boone's eyes open like a shot
: What did you say
:  said shut up, you want to ruin everything
Boone leaps to his feet, grabs and easily overpowers the smaller man
: What did you say, just now
[suddenly friendly]: What did you say, just now
: You said Midian
[coyly]: Did
Maybe
[hurting him - desperate]: What do you know about it
: It's where the monsters go
It takes away the pain
Narcisse reaches his hands into his pockets, then comes out with long, silver, razor-sharp artificial nails, curved like hooks, attached to his thumbs
He holds them right at Boone's throat, ready to cut
He smiles
[cont
]:
what do you know about it
[pause; cautiously]: They forgive you there
: Uh-huh
Ever kill anybody
: Yes
: See, they only take you if you're worthy
You know what they do to those that aren't worthy
Boone shakes his head
Narcisse draws one razor-nail lightly across his own throat
thin trickle of blood runs down his neck
He chuckles
: It's real
Midian's real
[Narcisse nods; carefully] And you know
where it is
Don't you
We could go there
: They sent you
They sent you to take me
: That's right
But first  need to know
you have to tell me
where it is
: It's a test
[Boone nods; Narcisse leans in to him - whispers] No maps
: But you do know
Don't you
[looks around; leans in again]: North of Athabasca
East of Peace River
Near Shere Neck, north of Dwyer
Satisfied, Boone releases him, go back to the bed, collects his jacket
[cont
] [ exhilarated]: You'll take me with you, 'm worthy, you ask anyone,  knew you'd come, they sent you to take me, was waiting
know,  know, first  have to show you, that's how it works
Boone is looking out of the window in the door, sizing up his escape
: Show me what
: My true face
That's what there are for
[he raises his bladed thumbs] So you can see
'm not a natural man
Underneath 'm a monster, that's how it works;  show you, then you take me with you
He puts the blade to either side of his face
We hear the skin pop
:
Blood pours from Narcisse's face, as he traces the outline of his face
53 Dr Decker, who's just arrived with Lieutenant Joyce and two policemen, is speaking with the doctor that examined Boone
[urgent - showing Boone's file]:
he was an abandoned child, raised by the state, first diagnosis of incipient schizophrenia at thirteen, juvenile delinquency, periodically institutionalized through early adulthood
some violent episodes, never criminally charged as an adult, he's been in my care for less than a year
bloodcurdling scream from the semi-private room rivets the attention of the emergency room 54
- Following the nurse and an intern as they burst into the room and are greeted with the sight of Narcisse, blood running freely, ripping the least of his scalp off his bare skull, laughing and crying maniacally
Boone stands near the door, horrified
[variously]:
'
Nurse [over - to Boone] What the hell have you done
Boone: Nothing
: Fucking junkies
[at the door - yelling into the corridor] Doctor
As the door swings open, Boone looks out into the corridor and at the far end of the emergency room he sees Decker and the cops looking his way
Medical support move towards the room, as the nurse and intern try to contain the ranting Narcisse
Boone grabs a loose doctor's coat off the back of the door, slips it on and backs out of the room
: Let's get some help in here
Pandemonium
Narcisse screams, as a half-dozen people struggle to subdue him
As help continues to rush into the room, Boone slowly backs away, out and around a corner
He stops beside a swinging door, sensing something
55
- Dr Decker moving through emergency towards the melee, stops on the other side of the swinging door, his senses lit up with alarm
He slowly turns to the door
Pushes it open
Empty
56 Boone moves rapidly away from the exit into the parking lot, tossing off the white coat, breaking into a run
He tries several car doors, finds one open, gets in
57 With a rush of adrenal intensity, Boone expertly rips open an under panel of the dash, locates and patches together the correct ignition wires and hot-starts the car
Closes the door
Puts it in gear
58 Boone slowly drives out of the lot trying not to attract the attention of the fleet of patrol cars sirens wailing, pouring into the area
: 59 Boone drives up an entrance ramp and onto the highway, past a sign that reads: ' 2/' : 60 Dr Decker, a few policeman and medical personnel wait outside the door leading to the semi-private room
Lieutenant Joyce exits and a surgeon follows a moment later
: What's he saying
: He's talking but he's not making any sense
Something about a place called Midian
: He's dying
think he wants to die
Pause
The surgeon moves on
[unobtrusively - to Joyce]: Lieutenant,  know Boone,  know how he talks, how he manipulates
Perhaps if the right thing is said to this man it'll trigger something
[consider]: No harm in trying
: 'll do my best
But 'll need privacy
Decker enters the room
61
- Looking in through the room, we see Decker cross the room to the bed where Narcisse is lying
Decker says something to the nurse
She exits
Decker moves closer to the bed
He reaches into his pocket for something and moves out of our sight
: 62
/
/ Montage - Boone drives through the night, and the following day, through a landscape which becomes increasingly more desolate
: 63 The road sign reads: ' - 56 ' Boone's car speeds past
: 64 Boone's car rolls to a stop
Boone steps out and looks at something in the dust
battered sign
It reads: '/ 63' There is no sign of life
: No
oh no
[in despair] No
His shout echos
The wind blows up a cloud of dust around him
He walks through the dust, on the verge of tears
And then
the dust clears, and he sees
: 65 Necropolis, lying on the other side of a thick expanse of reeds
Puzzlement overtakes despair
He squints to see more clearly
The Necropolis is vast
High walls, surrounded by reeds, with the tops of mausoleums, showing above it
ALmost a fortressed town
Boone starts towards it
66 The sun is low in the sky, the light golden glinting off the gates
The reeds sigh
Boone pushes one of the gates open and steps inside
His footsteps echo, unnaturally loud in this city of the dead
To either side of him, elegant and elaborate mausoleums, running away into the distance, with numerous smalls tombs set around and between them
The sun finally sinks out of sight
Its final glow dies on the tops of the mausoleums
There are already stars overhead
Boone walks on a little way, as the night sounds begin
Exhausted, he sits down on a tomb and leans back against the stone
[softly - a bitter irony]: Dead
all of the dead
He rummages for a cigarette in his jacket pocket
Pulls one out
Lights it
The flame seems to excite sounds around him
He looks up
The walkways are empty in both directions
There's a guttural sound at his back
He stands, drops the cigarette, backs away
From the darkness behind him steps a huge form
knife is put to his lower belly
Its wielder, Kinski, is a massive man, face distorted, his features grotesquely bifurcated
[whispers]: Move and  gut you
Boone stays still
The growling from between the tombs becomes words
[from the darkness]: You got him
:  got him
reptilian hand reaches out and picks up Boone's dropped cigarette
: Midian
Are you from Midian
: We should take him below, Peloquin
The silhouette of Peloquin, a were-creature, moves between the tombs
He draws on the cigarette
By its brightening point we glimpse an extraordinary face: more animal than human, but no recognizable species
: He's not Nightbreed
He's Natural
: No
've killed people, 'm like you, that's why 'm here
: Shut the fuck up
You're meat
: If we eat him we break the Law
: My God
my God, it's true
: Of course it's true
Everything's true
[he starts to emerge from the shadows] God's an astronaut
Oz is over the rainbow
And Midian's where the monsters live
And you came to die
:  didn't
didn't come to die
came to be with you, 'm one of you
Peloquin reaches out and touches Boone's chest
: No
Sorry
can smell innocence at fifty yards
: 've killed people
Fifteen people
: Who told you that
: What do you mean
: He lied, asshole
He lied
You're a Natural
And that means
you're meat for the Beast
Peloquin growls, throwing his head back and forth with a strange grace, the image flickering as he does so
Boone watches, amazed
In the blur of Peloquin's motion he transforms, the tentacles on his head lengthening and thickening, thrashing around as though they have a life of their own
He moves towards Boone, taking hold of him and tearing his -shirt open
: We mustn't
It's the Law
They'll exile us
: Fuck the Law
want meat
He bites Boone's neck, tearing at his flesh
: Peloquin, no
Kinski takes the knife from Boone's belly and pushes Peloquin aside
Boone slips away from them
: Damn you
He races after Boone, who runs blindly, his hand pressed to the wound on his neck
66A The Breed listen
We track running feet past the grille, and move close into grille, dropping through a dark rock face
67 67A In the deep darkness faces look up
The faces are strange and freakish
There is a woman locked in the embrace of a dark monster monstrous baby cries
68 Boone takes refuge against a mausoleum wall
He takes his hand from the wound on his neck
It is throbbing like a living thing, spreading across his muscle
He stares down at the wound, then touches it lightly
It gives him pleasure
sound above him
He looks up
Peloquin is climbing down the mausoleum wall, mouth opened wide to take off Boone's head
Boone throws himself forward as the jaws snap shut, missing him by inches
He runs
Kinski appears in his path
For an instant Boone thinks the game's up
: That way
The gate's that way
Boone sprints
69 The monsters watch and listen
70 Peloquin pushes Kinski aside and pelts after Boone, who is at the gate
He flings himself through, and slams it behind him
Peloquin is at the gate, when Kinski comes up behind and restrains him
: He's gone, give it up
You don't dare go out there
Peloquin stares at Boone through the gate
Panting, sweating, Boone stares back
Snorting with frustration, Peloquin recedes, he and Kinski disappear into shadow
Boone heaves a sigh of relief, turns from the gate and trudges away into the darkness, when suddenly
71 Harsh lights hit Boone from every side; police cars in the reeds all around, their searchlights focused on him
Two dozen cops, all levelling firearms
: Freeze
Right there
Boone squints against the glare
[cont
]: Aaron Boone, you're under arrest
Hands on your head
Boone takes a step back
The wound on his neck throbs and swells
At the edge of the light, Decker appears, stepping towards him
: Boone, listen to him, it's no use
[to Decker]: Stay back
[lowers his voice]: Lieutenant,  can bring him out
He'll listen to me
Joyce ponders, then signals him forward
Decker advances toward Boone
[cont
]: Boone, it's all right, 've explained everything to them
Rifles are cocked on every side
Decker stops a safe distance from Boone
[cont
]: They won't harm you,  give you my word
[hanging back]:  didn't do it
didn't hurt anyone
[lowering his voice]: Of course you didn't
: You
you believe me
: You wouldn't hurt a fly
[extends a hand] Come on, Boone
It's safe, 've seen to that
[taking a tentative step forward]: What, what about the pills
[pause; whispers]: What about them, Boone
: They weren't tranquillizers
look of alarm crosses Decker's face
Boone reads it
He gets the picture
[cont
]: You set me up
you bastard, you set me up
He lunges for Decker, who turns and throws himself to the ground as he yells
: He's got a gun
:
The bullets fly
Boone is about to pounce on Decker when he's hit by a barrage, thrown back, riddled with bullets
On the ground, Decker covers his head
Boone goes down
The volley ends
72 The sound of gunfire echoes through the walkways
73 In the shadows, a baby held in the arms of a woman with monstrous but beautiful features, begins to cry
74 Joyce hears the sound of crying and looks up
Boone's body lies on the ground
Decker rises, hearing the distant sobs on the wind
75 The mother hushes the child, her arms, which are tentacles, wrapping around it
76 The sound of crying is lost
Joyce moves forward, towards Decker and Boone
[trying to convince himself]:
just the wind
He reaches Decker, looks down at Boone's body
Looks around
[cont
]: Where's the gun
[seemingly dismayed]: He reached into his jacket
thought saw it,  swear
oh God, Boone
[quietly, to some cops, meaning Boone]: Get him outta here
77 We track towards a tomb, on which the epitaph reads: '  ' : : 78
/ Moving with Lori, flanked by Dr Burton the pathologist, and a grim Joyce
They enter a smaller room
Burton flips a switch
Curtains part in front of a thick glass panel, revealing a small, sterile viewing chamber
In the chamber are a morgue attendant and, lying on a stainless steel table, Boone's body
Lori looks at the body with heartbreaking sadness
She nods
Burton closes the curtains
Lori and Joyce exit
On the other side of the glass, the attendant rolls Boone on the table towards a door marked 'Pathology'
79 Dr Decker sits alone, looking into his briefcase
The door opens, Lori and Joyce enter
Decker closes the briefcase, rises, aggrieved, takes both of Lori's hands in his, speaks soothingly
: Lori, 'm Dr Decker
Boone was my patient
: Yes
Hello
: 'm so sorry for your loss
must tell you, you meant the world to Aaron
He spoke of you constantly
[withdrawing her hand - has the creeps]: Thank you, Doctor
Lori sits across a table from Joyce
Decker sits against the wall
: Miss Winston, are you sure you wouldn't rather postpone
: No
Let's get it over with
Joyce turns on a tape recorder on the table
[starting at the beginning]: What was your relationship with Aaron Boone
[pause]: We were lovers
We move in on the revolving reels of the tape recorder
: How long had you known Aaron Boone
: Two months
80 Burton and the attendant, instruments laid out, Boone's body on a brightly lit steel table, ready for the autopsy
Burton activates an overhead microphone
: Deceased is a white Caucasian male, late twenties
Suspected cause of death, multiple gunshot wounds to the thoracic cavity and extremities
The attendant lifts up Boone's jacket
Light streams through many bullet holes
: Jesus
They weren't takin' any chances
Burton picks up a small digging tool and zeroes in on one of the chest wounds
: Wound number one: entered between the fourth and fifth left ribs, impacted the lower rib, lodging in ligaments adjacent to the left lung
He digs
81 : So he never gave any indication
: No
: Surely there must have been something
[firm, angry]; Look, you can say whatever you want to about him
don't believe it
He never raised a hand to me, he never harmed anyone in his life
strained silence
Decker drums his fingers on his briefcase
: Miss Winston, everyone has their secret faces
: Drop dead
Annoyed at Decker, Joyce turns off the tape recorder
: We'll continue this some other time
Lori stands and heads for the door
82 pair of callipers drop a distended bullet into a steel bowl, containing at least ten other similarly maimed bullets
Fatigued with effort, Burton wipes his forehead, turns off the microphone
: Coffee break
The attendant turns off the bright overheads, he and Burton move into an adjoining lounge
83 Lori is putting on her coat
contrite Decker approaches her
: Miss Winston,  hope you didn't misinterpret what  said
Boone meant a great deal to me
: Where did he die
[pause] What was the name of the town
:  place called Midian
84 85 The bowl wobbles on the ground
The bullets roll off in different directions
Sound of glass breaking
86 Hearing the breaking glass, Lori and Decker turn back towards the autopsy room
: Boone
She runs towards the sound, Decker follows
87 In slow motion, a large first-floor window shatters out towards us
88 As Lori, then Decker enter, moments after Burton, Joyce and the attendant
The autopsy table is empty
: Someone's taken him
: My God
[looking around]: Where's his coat
89 Slow motion  distorting time, we see the rest of the shattering window and a dim figure crosses the moon
: : 90
' Lori hurriedly throws some belongings into a suitcase
We see some newspaper clippings beside the suitcase
headline reads: ' ' Another features a map, showing the location of Midian
91 Montage - Lori drives, at high speed, down the same roads Boone took previously
92 At sunset, Lori enters the town, past a sign that reads: ' /   ' 93 Lori pulls into the parking lot of the motel
neon sign reads: '  ' Above it, the moon
From the motel itself, sounds of revelry
94 wood-panelled, Western Frontier-themed bar
Country music banner welcomes rodeo participants
number of rough types clustered at tables, many of them wearing baseball caps adorned with buffalo horns
Lori enters, looks around
cowboy lassoes a waitress, ropes her in to general applause
Lori takes a seat at the bar and is approached by a bartender
: What'll it be, darlin'
:  draft and some information please
[taps a stein of draft]: There's the draft
[lays down a bill]: 'm looking for a town called Midian
: You're not the first
: No
: Had a bunch of  news folks passin' through, since they nailed that baby-slasher up there
: Baby-slasher
: Yeah, hell of a week for us
The rodeo this weekend
That scumbag gets blown away
hear it took thirty slugs to bag that sucker
Just goes to show you, don't it
People love a spectacle
Lori's hit with a burst of emotion
She doesn't want the bartender to see her cry
: Where's the bathroom
: Right around the corner there, darlin'
Lori rises, exits
95 Lori enters and leans on the sink as the grief hits her
She sobs stall door opens behind her: Sheryl, a girl in her early twenties, exits
Lori pulls a tissue from her bag and tries to compose herself, standing back to allow Sheryl access to the mirror, where she studied herself before starting to tease her hair
: Which is it, hon', men or money
[Lori looks at her] It's usually one or the other, ain't it
: Oh
[a tiny smile]
man
: Uh-huh
What'd he do, leave
: Not exactly
: Jesus, did he come back
That's even worse
In spite of herself, Lori's brightened by the girl's good humor
[cont
]: Some loser takes a shine to ya, you could toss 'em in the river tied to a piano he'll come back faster than a dog with a bone
Thing is, why go to all this trouble to look so good if there's nobody to admire the end product, am  right
: Can't argue with that, [likes her, feeling lonely] Can  buy you a drink
: Hell, yes you can
Better than gettin' hit on by some damn buffalo
: 186 Lori and Sheryl at the bar
Lori's nursing a beer
Sheryl's into her fourth Black Russian and is getting friendlier by the moment
[pause - just heard the story]: Lord
have seen men go to great lengths to walk out on a girl
But,  must say,  have never heard tell of a fella doin' it while deceased
: They think some sick bastard's stole the body
: So you want to go check out the place in which he checked out
: Yeah
Guess it's a way to say goodbye, you know
He was always a mystery to me
loved him
[she looks away] : Tell you what, Lori, why don't  drive up there to this Medium place with you tomorrow and keep you company
: You don't have to do that
: Yeah, but 'm goin' to and  don't want no argument from you
[smiles, grateful]: Okay
Thanks
: That's all right
[finishes her beer]: Guess 'll head up to my room
: You get some rest, sugar
'm gonna stay down here and close this damn bar
Maybe one of these lunkheads'll win the lottery
Lori smiles, squeezes her hand, exits the bar
Sheryl looks around, finishes her drink
The bartender sets another drink down in front of her
: Courtesy of that gent in the suit at the end of the bar
Sheryl looks down the bar, sees the man, seems impressed, waves
[low, to the bartender]: Isn't he just the picture of sophistication though
96A We Cut to a wide shot of the Necropolis by night
shooting star falls
Now we move in on one of the mausoleums, and from the ground below we hear a ritualistic chanting
Once within the darkness of the mausoleum the camera slides down over the rock face into the depths of Midian
The volume of the chanting increases as we come close to its source
96B We come into the mural chamber, the camera passing down over the family tree of Naturals and Nightbreed and round to see Rachel and Kinski approaching and entering the door of the initiation chamber
Cut to Narcisse and Boone, also approaching the chamber
: You'll like this
No, really
It's just their way of welcoming you to the club
: 'm not sure  want to be a member
: You made your way back here for the same reasons  did
We belong here now
There's nowhere else on earth would take us in
: 96C In the middle of the chamber is a kind of font, on which stands a bowl of Baphomet's blood, steaming and bubbling
Standing in front of it is Lylesburg
To his side Peloquin
Beside him, Rachel
On Lylesburg's other side, Ohnaka
Standing around the walls as witnesses to the ceremony, are a variety of Breed
Boone enters
The Breed all look his way
Boone sees Shuna Sassi
[to Narcisse in a whisper]: Who is she
: Shuna Sassi
Why
:  dreamt her
Shuna leans towards Peloquin
: 've dreamt him
Narcisse nudges Boone forward
: Who is your advocate
:  am
: Have you tutored him in the Law
: Yes he has
: Let the advocate answer
: Yes  have
: You understand what you do, becoming one of us
With this night you turn your back on the Natural World
The life you lived will after this be as a dream
:  know
Lylesburg takes the glove off his right hand
The flesh beneath is cauterized
: The blood of the God tells all truths
It can harm as easily as heal
Are you prepared to be judged
: 'm ready
Lylesburg nods, and puts his hand into the bowl of the blood
The blood bubbles around his wrist
We cut to Peloquin and Shuna Sassi, who are watching Boone intently
Boone's eyes are now on Lylesburg's smoking hand as it approaches Boone's chest, still marked by his wounds
: Be judged
He puts his hand on the bullet wounds
Boone stiffens
But there's no pain
When Lylesburg's hand is removed, the wounds have gone
There's a visible release of tension on the faces of all those watching
: Aaron Boone, in the name of Baphomet, Lord of the tribes of the moon,  bid you welcome
The camera moves out of the chamber, and towards the mural
97 Lori lies awake in bed, staring at the ceiling
Outside, and next door, the noise of laughter and partying
[quietly, a tear in her eye]:  still love you, Boone
: 98 Sheryl is sitting at the empty bar, obviously hung over
She is wearing dark glasses and a horned Buffalo Days hat
The bartender pours her an eye-opener
: Hair of the dog
Lori enters
: Hi
: How's your head
: My momma always used to say, 'Sheryl Ann, there's a man out walking around with your name on his mind, all you got to do is run into him
' : And he just happened to be checked in here at the crossroads of the world
: Isn't that something
His name is Curtis, he is a banker, recently divorced and recently relocated in Edmonton, up for the rodeo and better yet, he thinks  am the Queen-bee's knees
: Sheryl, you sure you want to come along
: Wouldn't miss it
Besides, Curtis has to do business today, we've got an engagement for this evening and if  sit around all day with this head on 'm gonna feel like the hind end of a dog sled
: 'm glad for your company
: Now if we could just make a quick stop for some Alka-Seltzer
: 99 100
/
' Lori's car comes to a stop near the edge of the reeds outside the Necropolis
: Jesus
Looks like the gold rush is over
Lori parks the car
She gets out, looks around
[quiet - reflective]: Why
Why would Boone come here
: To get away from it all
[Lori gives her a look] Shut up, Sheryl Ann
You go do what you have to do
'll stay here and
do somethin' else
Lori nods and heads away down the street, leaving Sheryl beside the car
She leans against the car, surveys the emptiness, without enthusiasm
[cont
]: My luck, 'll end up buying some real estate
101 Lori - as she leaves the reeds and sees the outer walls of the Necropolis
: Good God
102 Sheryl - wandering from the car into the reeds
She lights a cigarette, tunelessly humming to ward off the willies
She stops, shivers, suddenly feeling very isolated
The atmosphere's got to her
She starts back to the car
She catches some movement out of the corner of her eye
Stops
Slowly walks away from the movement, fighting off panic
She turns a corner, and realizes she's lost in the reeds
She hears movement behind her, turns, startled, then, oddly, she smiles
: Curtis
what are you doing here
It's Decker, looking like a commuter, hair slicked back, wearing an overcoat, carrying his briefcase
[big smile]: Hello, Sheryl Ann
103 Lori reaches the gates, slightly breathless
She pushes one of them open
The sun is hot and bright, transforming the Necropolis from the dark, dangerous place it was when Boone was here
Now, with its gothic tombs and burgeoning plant life, it's almost welcoming
104 Lori wanders the walkways, enchanted by the splendor of the place
There are strange, bittersweet sights along the way: statues of dogs sleeping on their masters' graves; of mourning mothers; of children, sitting at their graves
And grotesque images too: gargoyles protecting the doorways of mausoleums; a tiger, roaring in stone
It is another world, solemn and silent
Except
suddenly, the sound of an animal in pain
Lori stops and looks around
Her gaze comes to rest on a spreading laurel tree beneath which the shadows are pitch black
From here, the sobbing comes
She approaches
There is an animal beneath the tree, barely discernible
She can see its flanks panting, its head moving in pain
: Jesus
It doesn't look like a recognizable species, an amalgam of wild cat and deer
She approaches
It raises its head, weakly
Its eyes are huge and black
[cont
]:
It's okay,  won't hurt you
it's okay
The creature shudders
[cont
]:
What's happened to you
Let me see
She reaches beneath the branches and tentatively strokes the animal
It responds by dropping its head back on to the grass
[cont
]: Oh God
you poor thing
don't die, please don't die
She pushes beneath the tree, puts her arms beneath the creature and picks it up
It is heavy, a dead weight in her arms
She backs out from beneath the tree
As she steps back into the sun, the creature snarls and starts to wither in her arms
She realizes what's causing it pain and steps back into shadow
[cont
]: You don't like the sun
Is that it
The sound of sobbing, off to her left, draws her attention
One of the mausoleum doors is open, and a woman, Rachel, dressed in black, stands in the shadows, weeping
Lori's astonished
[cont
]: 'm sorry
is, is it yours
: Bring her
Bring her, please
Shading the creature from the sun, Lori moves to the door and steps into the gloom
105 The interior is marble, the air murky
Rachel, a fine-boned, pre- Raphaelite beauty in her thirties, moves back against the far wall, nursing a wounded arm
Lori looks down at the creature she's carrying, utterly limp in her arms
:
'm afraid it's too late
: No
she can't die
Bring her to me, please
Rachel reaches out
Lori's reluctant to move further into the darkness
: Hurry
As Lori crosses the floor, she hears whispering from a stairway that leads down into the earth
She stops, frightened
: Pay no attention
Please, bring me my Babette
As the creature is named it starts to move in Lori's arms
Not only move, but change
Its claws grab at Lori's breast as it writhes
[cont
]: Babette, no
: What's happening
: Don't look
Don't look
But Lori can't help but look
Appalled, she tries to pull the transforming creature off her, but its hold is firm
: Jesus
Jesus
With effort, she detaches the creature's claws from her, almost throwing it at Rachel, who cradles the changing creature in her arms
: Babette
Lori leans against the wall, trying to wipe the sticky fluids the creature's exuded onto her hands
When she looks up she sees the creature in Rachel's arms has transformed into a pale, beautiful girl of seven or eight
Lori's dumbstruck
: What
what
what the
: She likes to play outside
tell her: you mustn't play in the sun
The sun will hurt you
But she's just a child
She doesn't understand
Lori looks back towards the open door, and the sun-drenched walkway outside
Then back at Babette
: This is too weird
[an urgent whisper]: You saved her
owe you something
listen;  know why you came here
: You do
: You must go, this place is not for you
Midian is a home for the Nightbreed
Only for the Nightbreed
: Is Boone here
Did somebody bring him here
deep baritone voice rises up from the shadows of the stairwell
: Rachel
you have said too much already
Lylesburg appears, a commanding, magisterial man with a vast grey beard and three slits on each cheek that look like gills
Loping along beside him, his fool, a muscular man with an innocently beautiful face: Ohnaka
: My Lylesburg, she brought me Babette, she saved her
: We know
But you cannot help her
[her spunk surfacing]: Look,  saved the child's life, don't deserve something for that
: The child has no life to save, [he looks at her - sizes her up] But what she has is yours, if you want it
That's the Law
Do you want her
: No
just want some answers
: You weren't meant to see this
:  kind of got that impression
: Then you also understand that to speak of this to anyone will bring dire consequences
: Hey, pal, don't threaten me
: Not for you
For us
His words take the edge off Lori's anger
She notices that inscribed in the marble arch above the doorway are the words: ''   ' [cont
]: What's below remains below
This is the Law
Rachel is carrying Babette down the steps
Lylesburg turns to follow her
: Wait
Wait a minute
Boone, Aaron Boone, just tell me, is he here
You took him, you took his body, didn't you
Hey
Lori crosses to the stairs
Lylesburg's disappeared down into the darkness
[cont
]: Talk to me, damn it,  have to know - come back
105A Lori heads down the stairs
: Come back
Lylesburg, Ohnaka, Rachel and Babette have gone, however
Lori continues her descent
There are sounds in the darkness below her
She stops, and looks back towards the top of the stairs
It's a long way off
[to herself]: How deep does this go
She heads on down, turning a corner
In front of her, Peloquin
He starts towards her
She backs away, into a second creature, and starts up the stairs
As she does so a third creature swings down from the darkness above her head
She shrieks, and runs like hell
[calls after her]: Come back soon, y'hear
106 Lori emerges, squinting against the blinding sun, trying to calm herself
: Okay
Walk away, Lori
Don't panic
There's got to be a perfectly reasonable explanation, [can't sustain it] And hell if know what it is
She sprints back towards the gate
: 107 Out of breath, Lori reaches the car, parked where she left it
No sign of Sheryl
: Sheryl
Sheryl
Let's get the hell out of here
[no reply] Sheryl
Lori looks around
Sees Sheryl's purse in the dirt near the reeds
[cont
]: Sheryl
She moves towards the reeds
Picks up the purse
Peers inside the house
She hears a gurgling laugh from inside
It could be Sheryl
[cont
]: Sheryl, come on
108 The undergrowth is dark and empty
Lori advances cautiously through the paths
: Sheryl, we have to go, uh, something's kind of come up and
She sees a splash of blood on the reeds
[cont
]: Oh shit
Something moves across our field of vision in the gloom behind her
She turns
[cont
]: Sheryl
She turns back and follows the trail of blood around the corner, Lying on the floor is Sheryl
Mouth cut away
Tongue cut off
[cont
]: Jesus
God
She turns to run, but Decker steps into her path
He wears a mask of repulsive simplicity: a linen face with two buttons for eyes and a zipper [open at present] for a mouth
In his hands are two large carving knives, both blood-stained
: Let's get it over with, shall we
[mind racing, a survivor]: Take it easy, let's talk about this
[advancing]: Don't try and reason with me, Lori
'm a lunatic
You don't reason with lunatics
: How do you know my name
: Good question
No reason why you shouldn't have an answer
[he pulls off the mask] Wish  had a camera
Oh, the look a your face
: Why
Why did you kill her
: Why did  kill all the others
For the fun of it, of course
For pleasure
Everyone ought to have a hobby, don't you agree
: Boone was innocent
: Is innocent, wherever he's hiding
After all the trouble went to to find him a home for his guilt
: You sick motherfucker
: Boone's alive, Lori
And your death is going to bring him out of hiding
He comes at her suddenly, but his heel slides in Sheryl's blood
He falls in front of Lori, and stabs at her feet
She avoids the stab by an inch
He rises suddenly, throws one of his knives aside and grabs the blade Lori holds, with a glove which strikes sparks
It is chainmail
Lori lets go, propelling herself through the reeds
109 110 The light is diminishing behind the Necropolis walls
Lori's screams are distant
We track towards the gate as she runs down the hill
: Somebody help me
She flings the gate open and enters
Decker emerges from the reeds behind her
111 111A The temple is an impressive chamber, at the centre of which is a dais, ringed with representatives of the six failed saviours of Breed
In the middle of the ring, a statue of Baphomet
There are benches along the walls
Sitting in them, reciting in soft, sibilant voices the Laws of Midian, are Breed
Lylesburg, accompanied by Ohnaka, is also in the chamber, as is Boone, being held by the Breed
:  have to help her
: You can't go
: 'll kill him
No-one will ever know
: What's below remains below
:  can't let her die
: When we took you in you made an oath to obey the Law
:  won't listen to him butcher her
love her
: She's a Natural
She couldn't love you back
Not now
: Wrong
He starts to struggle against his captors, fighting them off
: You're wrong
Throwing one back, and punching the other, Boone breaks for the door
: Boone
Boone
Lylesburg's shout is ignored, as Boone heads up to the surface
112 Lori runs down the walkways pursued by Decker, her breath coming in gasps, close to collapse
: Help me
Oh please, God, somebody
113 114 Lori collapses
Decker reaches her and pulls on his mask
: That's good
Be still
It's quicker that way
He pulls a particularly nasty blade from his jacket interior and advances
She rises and tries to duck the cut
He strikes her with the back of his hand
She falls, striking her head on a tomb
[cont
] [sudden fury]:  said, be still
Lori is semi-conscious, blood running from her wounded head
Looking past Decker, she sees something
: Boone
Decker laughs
Then he realizes she's reacting to the appearance of Boone, standing in the shadows behind him, in jeans and leather jacket
Lori slips into unconsciousness
: You
Here again
: Isn't this where the dead are supposed to go
: You're not dead
[advancing]: You're wrong
We're both dead, Decker
: 'm not Decker
: No
Isn't that you, Dr Decker, hiding behind that child's mask
: 'm not hiding
[still advancing, taunting him]: Decker, Decker
Doctor Decker
Enraged, Decker throws the knife; it buries in the middle of Boone's chest
Decker laughs, then stops, as Boone pulls the knife out and tosses it aside
[cont
]: Blades are no better than bullets, Decker, don't you get it
'm dead
The walking dead
: That's not possible
Decker turns to run, but Boone races to him, catches, turns him and pulls Decker closer, until they're nose to nose
: Not just dead
changed
monster
Want me to show you
[whimpering]: No, please
: Not your kind of monster
Not the soulless kind
've got Midian in my veins
He tears off the mask, uncovering Decker's sweaty, terrified face
: Please, please, it's, it's not my fault, it's the mask, it makes me do things  don't want to
[Boone pulls him closer] Boone, it was the mask and they were going to find me, punish me,  needed a scapegoat
: You chose the wrong man
[
]: Man
You call yourself a man
Boone looks round; Narcisse is squatting on a tomb, his face a mass of scar tissue
[cont
]: You're no more man than  am
: Monster, then
: That's more like it
[he jumps off the tomb, moves towards them] Well, go on, are you going to kill him or not
Only  want his balls
And his eyes
That is, if you don't want them
: 'll pass
: Remember me, Doctor
was dying when you had your way with me
You made me tell my secrets when  was feeling particularly vulnerable
Now was that a nice thing for a doctor to do
[to Boone, craven]: Oh God, Boone, don't let him touch me, anything, keep him off me, full confession
sweet Jesus, mercy, mercy, please, 'm begging you
Narcisse raises his thumbs, still bearing their silver hooks
: Let's start with his eyes
: No
Boone pushes Narcisse back, but as he does so Decker slips his grasp
Boone roars and starts to twitch and stamp as Peloquin did and we watch as
Boone transforms into something part man, part carnivore
and gives chase
Decker nears the gate, but Boone is after him at great speed, leaping over tombs like a high-jumper
115 Left behind, Narcisse turns his eyes upon the recumbent Lori
[filled with hunger, greatly consoled): Well
you'll do
As he advances on her, Lori's eyes flicker open
She screams
116 Boone right on Decker's tail; he hears Lori's screams and stops
Decker runs out through the gate
Boone starts back towards Lori
: 117 Lori struggling in Narcisse's arms
He tries to muffle her
Boone leaps tombs, nearing their location
He bounds into the clearing, sees Lori unconscious in Narcisse's embrace
: Let her go
Narcisse, all sheepish co-operation, gently lets her go onto the ground
: Just
keeping her warm
Boone is almost human now
He reaches Lori
[cont
]:  wouldn't have touched her
Boone breathes in the last of his monstrous condition, and bends to tenderly stroke Lori's face
Then, very lightly, he kisses her, and gathers her in his arms
: : 118 118A
' :  had no choice
: You've put us all in danger for your love of this woman
: Decker can't tell anyone
What's he going to say
That he tried to kill a girl and a dead man stopped him
: He can still lead our enemies here
If he goes - if Midian's unearthed  you're responsible
: So let me make amends
: Just take the girl and go on your way amongst the Naturals
That's the Law
: Who made this Law
: Baphomet
The God in Obsidian
Who made Midian
: So maybe  should speak to this guy
: Baphomet is a spirit in stone
He doesn't speak, or move
His wounds are too great
: What are you afraid of
: What Baphomet made he has the power to unmake
His blood is volatile
He mustn't be angered
: Then 'll make nice
119 120
' Boone heads down the corridor
He slows as he passes an entrance to one side chamber and looks in
Inside the chamber, a dog-faced man is working on a vast elaborate mosaic mural that extends into shadow in both directions
He looks up and locks eyes with Boone
Boone breaks off the contact and continues down the corridor
The dog-faced man turns back to his palette; a multi-coloured collection of small tiles
He carefully selects a few, then turns to the mosaic and we see
121 The mosaic mural
Prominent in what appears to be a panoramic visual history of the Nightbreed race, is a heroic figure who closely resembles
Boone
The dog-faced man applies the tiles he's selected, filling in the irises of the Boone-figure's eyes
122
' Lori sits up
: Boone
Her head aches
She winces
Babette goes to her aid
: Be still
It was a bad hurt he did us
: Us
What do you mean 'us'
[moving to them]: You held Babette while she transformed
She's made quite a bond with you
:  felt your hurt
still feel it
: She even knew you were coming here
She saw it all, through your eyes
: And you can see through mine
[pause - she tries to read Rachel]: You're not kidding
: It's true
Lori rises unsteadily to her feet
Babette takes her hand, but Rachel moves her away from Lori
[cont
]: She doesn't want you to touch her, sweet
She's afraid
: You got that right
One minute 'm about to get carved like a Christmas turkey, the next 'm
'm
[a surfacing memory breaks her train]
God
it was Boone
Boone saved me
: Yes
: But he's dead,  saw him in the morgue
: You still don't understand, do you
: Wait a second, back up
: You're below now
With the Nightbreed
The last survivors of the great tribes
: Tribes of who
What
: We're shapeshifters; freaks; remains of races your species have almost driven to extinction
: So you're not immortal
: Far from it
The sun can kill some of us
Like Babette
She follows her father in that
Some of us could be shot down; others would survive that because they've got beyond death
: Horrible
It's all horrible
: To be able to fly
To be smoke, or a wolf; to know the night, and live in it forever
That's not so bad
You call us monsters, but when you dream, it's of flying and changing, and living without death
You envy us
And what you envy
[softly; understanding]:
We destroy
[to Babette]: Show her
Show her the past
Babette touches Lori's arm
: Be with me
The skulls in front of Lori fill her sight
We fly through one of the eye sockets into
123 123A
/'  [ ] Fade through from the skull chamber into grinning people running towards partially constructed bonfires
The people throw tinder onto the fires
We track off the fire-building to a wall, behind where frightened monsters hide
The shadow of a cross falls on them
: 123B
/'  [ ] Inquisitors in black robes part to reveal the Head Inquisitor in purple robes
He reads the charges
: Thou shalt not suffer a monster to live
: 123C
/'  [ ] Frightened monsters pulled away from the wall
: 123D
/'  [ ] Inquisitors step aside to show torture scenes
We track through the tortures: racks, crucifixion, floggings, a hanging
The camera moves off gallows, past a wall to flags
We cut close on the flag which reads  , track past the flag to a cage, containing freakish Breed
Well-dressed ordinary men and women applaud and laugh
One of the freaks is dragged from the cages
He looks back at the family he's left behind
The inquisitor reads their charges, as the bonfire awaits
The Victim is thrown onto the bonfire
tinder flares, and the inquisitors and audience light cigarettes and cigars from the tinder
The bonfire then flares up
An inquisitor lasciviously strokes the naked buttocks of a beautiful girl
She turns towards us in despair; we see her head is bestial
124
' Overwhelmed with horror, Lori opens her eyes, breaking her connection with Babette
: We are all that remain
: And
and you're saying
Boone's like you
: He is Nightbreed
Or he was, until he broke the Law
[moving towards the door]: No, no, that's not possible - 've got to find him, there's been some kind of mistake
: Don't go
: But he didn't kill anybody, it wasn't him, he's innocent
: That no longer matters
: Where is he
Where'd he go
: Down to the Tabernacle, to Baphomet
: Who
: The Baptiser
Who made Midian
Who called us here and saved us from our enemies
: Take me there, 've got to find Boone
: It's forbidden
: We'll see about that
125
' Decker is drinking coffee
cop strides by
Joyce enters
: Decker
This better be good
:  found Boone
: Someone brought the corpse down here
: He's not dead
:  saw him pumped full of bullets
: So did
But he's alive
He killed again
: In Shere Neck
: No, out at Midian
: Why'd he go back there
Eigerman enters
: What are you doing in my office
: This is Inspector Joyce
Calgary Police Department
: We don't need any city boys on the case
Midian's under my jurisdiction
: We can work together
: No we don't
'll bring him in myself
This is my town
: He's not alone anymore
: What
: Yeah
heard that talk
That's nuthouse talk
: Talk about what
: Midian's not empty
There's something breeding there
Below the cemetery
: Bullshit
[to Decker]: Do you believe that
: Yes  do
And if you don't stop them there's going to be more bloodshed
promise
126 127 Lori finds herself in a cavernous space, lined with chambers connected by walkways and ladders, which don't look particularly secure
She moves out on to a walkway
It leads her into the central core of Midian, which offers a view of dizzying descent into the earth
She scans the scene, amazed by the sheer scale of the place
: My God
As she descends into the bowels of Midian, creatures in various doorways watch her with curiosity
One creature seems to have light running from wounds on its body
Another tumbles past her, a slow acrobat, defying gravity
She sees only a few of these but hears far more, chattering and murmuring in the shadows
127A As Lori moves through the chambers toward Peloquin we see the devil creature Lude feeding snakes to his pet, a horned, many legged beast which squats on the floor
He gets up and goes to look at her
Leroy, a grinning grotesque, appears from the back of the chamber, snatches the snake from the maw of the pet, and comes to watch as well
[eating the snake]: There goes the neighbourhood
128 128A Lori looks into a chamber
dark, winged figure moves aside to reveal
ceremony, with the bowls of white blood later seen in Baphomet's chamber, is in progress
128B As Lori crosses the bridge something watches from the deep shadows
the tone darkens
She steps off the bridge and scorpions scuttle away
Lori is now a little nervous
She finds herself in a corner with several doors
Through one door she sees a man with a white -shirt
She calls after him
: Boone
Lori enters through the door
128C In a corner a ghastly meal is underway
The Boone figure is heading away through another door
Lori follows the figure, and the diners get up as if to attack
In the next chamber is a tangle of bright red glistening bodies with no heads
Lori glances round
The diners pursue her
128D Up ahead of Lori is the Boone figure
She approaches it as it steps out of the shadows
It is not Boone
She steps away
128E The red beast is rising behind her
Lori turns and exits the chamber, flattening herself against the rock
She advances
Crouched in a niche above where she's walking, we see a small lizard-like creature, Barabas, eating a dead rat
128F Lori enters the final chamber, following the figure she thinks is Boone
On the far side, crouching at a door, a figure
: Boone
The figure turns
It's Peloquin
: No-one here of that name
She turns
The Boone figure is in the doorway behind her
He has the face of a snake
: Told you
He approaches Lori
:  know you
He talks about you
Lori
He snatches a broach from her
: Nice
You're still a Natural
Want to join the family
[he goes to bite her] : No
Peloquin follows her to the door
[at door]: You will
Sooner or later you'll want to live forever
He laughs maniacally, returning into his room
129 Lori continues her descent
As she nears the cavern floor, Lylesburg steps into her path, beside him his fool, Ohnaka
: You may go no further
:  want Boone
: You're not to blame, but you must understand: what Boone's done has put us in jeopardy
: No problem, you tell me where he is and we're outta here
: Boone has gone to Baphomet
He is beyond recall
low rumbling issues from somewhere deep inside the passage Lylesburg stands before
Underneath the rumble is an animal moaning with pain
: Where is he
He's down here isn't he
You want to stop me you're gonna have to kill me
Impressed by her resolve, Lylesburg stands aside
She moves past him and heads down into the chamber, towards a distant light
Lylesburg gestures after her
Ohnaka nods and follows
129A
' Lori heads through a room which leads towards the Berserkers
The reassuring sounds of the Core fade behind her
She slows her advance
Suddenly, Narcisse steps from the shadows
: Up and about already
: Keep away from me
: 'm sorry about upstairs
see a pretty face and  want to kiss it
[Lori moves on past] Don't go down there
: Why not
[instant change of subject]: Don't you just love this place
Shangri-La on dope
love it
: What's that smell
[sniffs his armpits]: Not me
They keep the Berserkers down there
Mad bastards
They'll rip your head off and shit down your neck
: Boone went this way, right
: And won't be coming back
: 'll bring him
: You think love can raise the dead
: He's not dead
: He's that and more
If you don't believe me, you wait 'til he gets to sniff a little blood
That'll bring out the beast in him
'm telling you, don't go
:  have to
Nothing makes any sense without him
: Sense
Who needs it
Lori moves off down the corridor
Ohnaka follows her
[to Ohnaka]: Love those tattoos
130 131 132
' Lori starts down the corridor, the walls of which are cracked wide in places, the gaps covered with chains
From the other side she hears grunts and growls
Then, to her shock, one of the Berserkers' arms reaches up from a grille in the floor and snatches at her leg
She steps aside to avoid it, and another of the Berserkers' arms reaches through the mesh of chains, taking hold of her by the neck
It starts to choke her
She shouts for help
Ohnaka, Lylesburg's fool, appears from down the corridor
He starts to rattle the chains further along the wall
: Hey, Ghost
Hey, Slaughter
Come and get me
Come and get me
The arm around Lori's neck releases its hold, and we hear the sound of the creatures moving along the walls in Ohnaka's direction
: Fat-asses
Suddenly, arms reach for him through the chains
He steps away just in time
: Missed
He grins at Lori, proud of himself
: Where's Boone
: This way
He starts to lead her towards Baphomet's chamber
133
' Ohnaka and Lori reach the next to last chamber; a roaring from below, down a slope in front of them, walls vibrating with the din from Baphomet's chamber
Ohnaka withdraws
Blindingly bright light, out of which Lori spots a figure climbing towards them
: Boone
Boone
She moves down to Boone, scrambling up the slope towards her, drenched in sweat, half-mad with terror
: Don't
don't look
He reaches for her, then collapses
She starts down the slope to him
Dust falls from the roof, the din makes her reel
But she reaches him, starts to haul him to his feet
Then, she looks up and we get a glimpse of
134
' Out of the blinding light, and seemingly the source of it, a huge, black figure turns towards her, twelve feet high, severed limbs connected by sinews of hot, white energy and extruded spines, the face terrible, wise and beautiful
Lori's stunned, she averts her eyes
Boone collects himself enough to pull her away and they help each other frantically scrabble up the slope, out of the chamber
135
' As Lori and Boone emerge, Ohnaka appears and beckons them to follow
Too exhausted and frightened to speak, Boone and Lori follow
136 Ominous rumblings urge them on, as Boone and Lori make a stumbling ascent through the core, trailing Ohnaka's urgent lead, watched from the doorways by a variety of creatures
We cut to the ledge, and move to a chamber, where Peloquin and Shuna Sassi are making love
Peloquin hears Lori urging Boone on as they struggle across the bridge, and looks away from Shuna, out through the door
: Well, well
He goes to the door
[cont
]: Guess he couldn't take the heat
:  dreamt him
He's strong
: That's only because the bite was mine
: No, don't you see
He's the one from the prophesies
Cabal
The seventh saviour
: So why's he leaving
: Everything has its purpose
Maybe he hasn't learned to hate his tribe enough
He'll be back
Peloquin kisses her
: Why die waiting
137 The sun climbs over the horizon, sunlight penetrates the graveyard
mausoleum door creaks open, Lori and Boone rush out into the open air
Lori tries to lead Boone away, he squints painfully against the early light
: No, no,  belong here
[grabs him]: Bullshit
Boone, Boone, listen to me - you belong with me, that's why you lived, that's why we survived, because we belong together
Ohnaka swings the door shut behind them
Boone sees Lori, as if for the first time
She takes his hand, presses it to her face, her breast
[cont
]: This is me
This is why  followed you, this is what we're living for
His eyes clear
part of him seems to return
He embraces her
: Lori
: They don't need you
Nobody needs you but me
We'll go away, far away, where no-one will ever find us
love you
They hold each other
138 : Boone and Lori - two small figures, alone among the sepulchres
They move towards the gate together
: : 139 Empty streets
No activity
Lori's car pulls into the parking lot
140
' Lori turns to Boone, slumped down in the passenger seat, out of sight, wearing sunglasses
: 'll get my stuff, 'll be back in two minutes
: Don't leave me alone
: Boone
[fiercely]: No
[calmly  trying to hide her alarm]: Okay
We'll go in together
She hands him the Buffalo Days hat and opens the door
141 From a phone booth across the street we see Lori and Boone move towards the motel entrance
In foreground, a chain-mailed hand picks up the phone and dials
142 Boone and Lori enter the corridor that leads to her room
Eerie silence, save for a dog yapping somewhere
Boone stops
Alarmed, she turns to him
[whispers]: What's wrong
: Why is it so empty
: They must be at the rodeo
She hurries on, Boone follows, clearly disturbed
Lori unlocks her door, glancing back at Boone, who has taken off his sunglasses
There is something strange about the light in his eyes
subtle wave of colour passes across his face
:  smell blood
: What
: So much blood
She swings the door open
We expect a horror
Nothing
An ordinary room
: It's okay
: 113
' Lori enters and quickly gathers her belongings together
Boone, sweating with terror, slides down the wall into a squatting position
As Lori packs, she looks down, sees a hole in the wall, the result of some massive violence from the other side
She cautiously leans down, peers through the hole and quickly retreats, hand over mouth, horrified by what she's seen
: Boone
Boone appears at the door
[cont
]: Next door
Boone goes next door and turns the handle
144 145 Boone pushes the door open
Inside, a massacre: five dead card players, propped up around a poker table in a sick parody of a poker game tableau; throats slit, Buffalo Hats on their heads
Sitting in the middle of the table, a tall, elaborate house of cards
Boone moves into the middle of the room
On his face we can see the hunger he feels
Ripples of color begin to move over his features
He moves towards the corpses
as he does so, we hear a nearly deafening sound from outside
the vibrations knock over the house of cards and
146 Into the empty street, a helicopter descends, discharging Lieutenant Joyce and a platoon of heavily armed Swat Team cops
Local police cars pour in
Captain Eigerman climbs out of his cruiser to survey the siege
Decker introduces him to Joyce
Sharpshooters take up positions, training their weapons on the motel, as the Swat Team moves in
147 Lori moves to the door of the murder room
Boone is inside, his back to her
: It was Decker
Decker did this
In foreground, Boone's face begins to transform, which Lori can't see
She hears the cops outside
[cont
]: Boone, we have to get out of here
: Stay away from me
: Boone, what is it
:  don't want you to see
: See what
: Get out
Do as  say
:  won't leave you
As she crosses towards him, he turns
His face is in mid- transformation
148 Lori's scream echoes outside the motel
Joyce orders in the Swat Team
They charge, entering the motel
149 Lori backs out of the room in horror
: Oh my God
oh my God
She hears cops charging up the stairs
[cont
]: Boone
They're coming
: 150 The transformed Boone covers his face, slams the room door shut and moves towards the bodies
Lori hides at the end of the corridor as the Swat cops appear at the far end
On his knees, in the middle of some frenzied action we can't quite see, Boone stops and looks down at his blood-stained hands
: No
No
Out of sight, Lori watches the cops prepare to storm the room
150A Boone enters the bathroom with the sound of the Swat Team's entry to the motel on the track
He slams the door
There is blood on his face and hands
He goes to the sink and turns on the tap
Then he sees himself in the mirror, his transformed face is a shock, He looks at himself, appalled
Then a wave of nausea overtakes him
He throws up into the sink; a splash of blood and flesh he's just eaten
Wiping his mouth with the back of his hands he starts to breathe out his condition
His face transforms back to his normal state
He makes a sob of horror
(
): In here
Boone looks towards the door, sinking down against the tiles as he does so
The door is flung open
We see him cowering as the Swat Team come for him
151 152 Under cover of the trees and cars around the motel, Lori hides in a place where she can view the front of the building
She sees Eigerman talking with Joyce, Decker behind them
They look up as the Swat cops manhandle a hand-cuffed Boone out of the building
He has totally reverted to human form, the blood-stains seemingly a sure proof of guilt
Lori watches as he's thrown into a police car and driven off
: : 153 clank of keys opening locks
steel door swings open
Three cops rough-house Boone down the corridor, Eigerman right behind, passing other cells holding prisoners watching them go by
We hold on one, a young fundamentalist Baptist preacher, Reverend Ashberry
He has haunted, maniacally repressed eyes and the ragged look of a habitual drunk
154 Boone is thrown into the cell
Eigerman and the three cops, Labowitz, Sergeant Pettine and Gibbs, all practised hard guys, enter the cell after him
: Fuckin' freak
Fuckin' cannibal
[to his men] Stand him up
They haul Boone to his feet
Eigerman hits Boone with a wicked blackjack
[cont
]: You picked the wrong town, boy
We believe in real justice here, [a blow is delivered] They're gonna take you back to the city
[another blow]
but we're gonna leave you with something
[another blow]
to remember
[another]
us
by
Boone sags to the ground, unconscious
154A
' As the sound of Boone being beaten up filters through the wall, Ashberry sits in his cell, Bible in hand
He flicks the pages over, attempting to distance himself from the violence he hears with study
He halts at a page with an illustration
It is something from Revelations: monsters and demons doing battle with angels
He puts the book down, and turns over his palm
It is a mass of tiny scars
He closes his hand into a white-knuckled fist, retreating into the shadows in the corner of his cell
We cutback to his hand
Blood seeps between the fingers, as his nails dig into the meat of his palm
155
' Eigerman enters
Decker is standing looking at Eigerman's collection of photographs
: You still here
: 'm going back to Midian with you
: 'm not going anywhere
We got press folks and photographers coming in from all over
Wouldn't be polite to keep 'em waiting
Eigerman starts to exit again
Joyce is in the doorway
: Tell him
We got our man under lock and key
: Don't trust him
He
he
changes
've seen him
: 'll keep an eye out
: He was right about the motel
: So
: So maybe there are more of them
: Monsters
: Killers
cult
don't know
: You want to take some of the boys, take 'em Pettine
: Yes, Sir - : You, Tommy and Gibbs, take the Inspector out to the cemetery
Dig around
If you find anything with more two eyes, holler
got photographers wanting me
He exits
156
' Badly beaten, Boone lies in the corner, stirring when he hears the door unlocked
Labowitz ushers in a middle-aged, small-town physician, Doctor Rose
: Doctor's here to examine you, freak
Just so nobody can say we laid a finger on you
[he winks at Rose] Looks okay to me, what do you think, Doc
Boone painfully pulls himself upright
Looks up at Dr Rose, who slips on his stethoscope, listens to Boone's chest
He moves it, listens, moves it again, alarmed
He takes Boone's wrist, feels around
Boone stares at him
Dr Rose clears his throat, rises, moves to Labowitz at the door and speaks quietly
: No pulse
: What's that
: No
pulse
157 crowd of journalists and on-lookers mill outside the station
We find Lori, following her through the crowd as she tries to get a view of the building
As she watches, Joyce and his three-cop escort climb into two police cars and drive off
158 An impromptu press conference, with Eigerman centre stage, standing at a table laced with tape recorders and microphones
Behind him, a map of the town, with coloured pins and a blackboard drawing of the Sweetgrass Inn, including a diagram of where the bodies were found
Eigerman adores the attention
: Yes he may have had accomplices but  can't reveal the precise source of my information on that
1ST : Local source, Captain
[a glance at Decker in the crowd]: Not so's you'd notice
2ND : Has Boone made a confession
: We found him with a piece of human flesh in his mouth
How's that for guilty
Cameras flash furiously
We see Labowitz leading Dr Rose through the crowd to the podium
Labowitz reaches Eigerman and whispers in his ear
Eigerman makes him repeat it
His brow knits in puzzlement
He turns to the press and smiles
[cont
]: 'Scuse me, folks, won't be a second
Eigerman points a beckoning finger at Decker, who follows him into his office, along with Labowitz and Dr Rose
159
' Eigerman closes the door and turns to Decker
: Just exactly how many bullets did they put into this geek up at Midian
: Why
[severely shaken]: Half of them are still in him
In fact, he's riddled with them
: As  told you, these aren't ordinary people
You're saying he should be dead
: No, 'm saying he is dead
: When
: Not lying down dead, friend
Walkin' around in my fucking cell dead
Now what about that
Decker's shaken
He grips his briefcase tightly
160
' Boone sits in his cell, head down, expression masked, eyes moving restlessly
160A
' Ashberry is sitting half in shadow and half in light
His eyes carry the half-buried mania that we'll see erupt later on
He puts his head against the wall and speaks softly to Boone, his tone intensifying as his feelings take stronger hold
: Can you hear me
They'll find a way to kill you, you know that
Can't fight the darkness
Not when it's inside you
Are you listening
You're an abomination, Boone
You have to die
There's lots of ways
've read about them
Seen them when sleep
Horrible
He suddenly slams his bloody hand against the wall
: Have you got a God, Boone
Any God'll do
had one, but
he doesn't listen any more
ask him to take the dreams away but they keep coming
Blood and fire
Like the end of the world
We move from Ashberry's stricken face to the bloody mark his hand left in the wall
It vaguely resembles something we recognize: Baphomet's head
: : 161 Lori emerges from a supermarket with food to eat
She walks into a small square, finds a seat and sits down to eat
As she reaches into the bag: [
]:Lori
She looks round
The voice sounded real
No sign of Babette
[
- cont
]: Lori
close your eyes
[frightened]: Where are you
[
]: Please, do as  say
Lori closes her eyes
162 Lori and Babette's
- darkness
[
]: Be with me
be with me
Dim light
We're in the Midian skull chamber, seeing it through Babette's eyes
Their voices merge into one
/ [
]:
where am
What's happening to me
Rachel steps into view, and looks directly down at the camera
: What is it, child
163 Lori's eyes spring open
She's terrified
[
]: Lori
Comeback
Lori closes her eyes again and we click back into
164 Lori and Babette's
- we see Babette's view of Rachel
/ [
]: Is this real
[whispers]: What are you talking about
Babette
[grips Babette] What have you done
/ [
]: 've brought her, to see
She's in me
Babette breaks away, Rachel tries to catch hold, Babette runs
camera veers around and down through the maze of Midian
165 Eyes closed on the bench, Lori gasps as the journey snatches her up
166 Lori and Babette's
- Babette races over a rope-bridge
We see it all through her eyes, her hands coming occasionally into view
We head down a narrow tunnel and into a small chamber, which is Babette's hidehole
We scan the treasures she keeps there: a doll made of grasses; birds' skulls; pretty stones
We hear voices from above and we look up at a steel grille, facing out on the surface
166A Pushing closer to the grille we see
Joyce, Pettine, Tommy and Gibbs, wandering through the Necropolis, armed to the hilt
Only Joyce carries no weapon
: Christ, you could hide a fuckin' army in here
: What egg-zactly are we lookin' for, Sarge
[spits some tobacco juice on a tomb]: We're here to kick some major-league butt
[distrusts these throwbacks]: We're here to scout, not engage : Well what if they engage us
What about that
: There's people down there,  can feel it
Lori/Babette gasps, Pettine hears the sound and walks over to the grille
: Why don't we just shoot 'em in their graves
Save us diggin' new ones, [giggles - fires at one of the tombs] [angry]: Hold your fire
: We want prisoners, Tommy
Pettine goes down on his haunches beside the grille, runs the muzzle of his gun along it
camera withdraws into the shadows
He shakes his head and
167 We cut out of the
as Pettine stands
: There's something down there all right
: If that's the case we'll call for back-up
Pettine spots a movement in the shadows of a half-open mausoleum door
He catches Gibbs' eye, nods in the direction of the door, Gibbs gets the idea and starts to back towards the tomb
[a performance]:  don't know
Maybe we're just spooked
Hell, who'd live in a graveyard, anyway
[crossing towards Gibbs] What do you say, Lieutenant
Maybe we oughta just pack it in
head for home
He and Gibbs rush the door of the tomb; there's a cry of surprise from inside
168 Lori and Babette's
- Camera glides back up to the grille in time to see Gibbs and Pettine drag Ohnaka out of darkness and into the sunlight where he lacks the strength to resist
: Well, lookee what we got here
Tommy strikes Ohnaka with a rifle butt, knocking him to his knees
169 As the cops circle around Ohnaka, he moans, puts his head down and covers his face with his hands
: Shit
Don't look so tough to me
: Want we should interrogate it, Lieutenant
[amazed]: Give it some room
In the sunlight, Ohnaka's naked back begins to smoke and blister
: What the hell for
: God damn it
There's something wrong with him
[disgusted]: Shit
: What the fuck is this
Gibbs, unfazed, steps up to Ohnaka and kicks the creature over
: We want answers, asshole
: Back off, Gibbs
Gibbs ignores him, trying to drag Ohnaka's hands away from his face
170 Lori and Babette's
- Watching the knot of men around the defenceless Ohnaka
/ [
]: The light
171 Gibbs rifle-butts Ohnaka's hands, then pulls them away from his face; the features are horribly disfigured, blood running from his eyes, scorched by the sun
Now even Gibbs tries to back away, but Ohnaka grabs hold of his shirt
: Shit
Shit
Get it off me
Tommy
: No way, man
Pettine fires his piece at Ohnaka, hitting him in the belly and arm, but he still holds on, throwing back his head and howling
Smoke rises from his entire body, dust pours from his veins
The howl becomes a high-pitched whine and he explodes, in a burst of dust and black blood
172 Lori and Babette's
- They see Ohnaka die
173 Lori opens her eyes, which are running with tears
: Oh my God
oh my God
She stands up, her hand to her mouth
174 Lori and Babette's
- Babette's trembling hands hold onto the grille as she watches
[
]: Lori, don't leave, please don't leave me
175 The cops stare in disbelief at Ohnaka's dusty remains
: Jesus
d'you see that fucker's face
: It was the sun
The sun did it
: Christ on a crutch
: Man, that tears it, 'm calling the fuckin' chief
Gibbs raises a trembling match to his cigarette as Tommy heads back to the cars
: Couldn't have been just
just the sun
: Believe it, shithead
[grinning]: So if all it takes is the sun, we got the perfect weapon, right over our heads
: Until it goes down
Pettine's smile fades
Then a cry of alarm from the distance
[
]: Oh no
Shit
Pettine
Goddamn it
The men rush to the gate
176 The two police cars are on fire
The other cops reach them, Pettine reaches into the one less involved in flame and pulls out the radio microphone
: Who did it, did you see anyone
Tommy shakes his head
They all look up, hearing a distant car engine
177
/
- Wearing a hat and dark glasses, laughing, Narcisse drives this old clunker like a maniac, takes a large cigar out of his mouth
He strikes a match off a thumb hook and lights up
In the back, protected from sunlight by shades on the windows, is Rachel
178 The door opens, a panicked Labowitz enters
: Chief, come quick
[from inside a stall]: This better be good
: Pettine's on the radio, they're under attack
: Hot damn, we got contact
He bursts out of the stall, hitching his trousers
179
' Eigerman enters, takes the two-way receiver
Behind him, Decker, Labowitz and Kane enter the office
: Pettine, what's your situation
: 180 ' Pettine on the radio, as the others try to keep back the flames
[into radio]: The place is crawling with 'em
they torched our cars
fuckin' freaks
The transmission breaks up
Eigerman turns to the others in the room
[joyfully]:
Sound the call, boys, let the bells of freedom ring, we got to mobilize
Decker affectionately runs his hand over his briefcase
181 Lori moves down the street, blinking through tears
[
]: 'm afraid
:  have to go, Babette,  have to get help
'll be back, promise
You hide somewhere
The connection fades
Lori wipes the tears from her cheeks
182 The crowd and journalists still hanging around; Eigerman throws the door open
: Listen up
We got officers under attack,  need volunteers for a posse
'all sign up with Officer Labowitz here
He moves back towards the office, as Labowitz, clipboard in hand, is besieged with offers
183
' Decker is sitting with his briefcase open on his lap, gazing at the button head mask inside
He snaps the case shut as Eigerman re-enters, followed by the silent Kane
Eigerman digs a key out of his desk
: If you're gonna make an omelette you have to break eggs, isn't that right, Professor
[doesn't follow]: Sorry
: Christmas comes early this year
184 Eigerman leads Decker, Kane and another cop down into the bowels of the station
He unlocks a door and switches on a light
Warehoused inside is a virtual arsenal in a number of packing crates stencilled with a martial insignia and the name: :   ' The crates are also stamped with their countries of origin: South Africa and the Soviet Union
: Ounce a' prevention is worth a pound a' cure
Save for a rainy day, one day that day will come
Don't matter if it's Commies, homos, freaks or Japs, we are ready
World class ordnance, Doc: the best private sector money can buy
Kane, with a clipboard, goes over supplies with the other cop
[over above  in his element): Okay
We got your spankin' new G3 thirty-odd-six Springfield semi-auto with roller-lock action and retractable stock
For standard carbine firepower, you can't beat this match-accurate Galil  7
62  assault rifle and for the sportsman in the crowd we carry this handy, double-pump, Mossberg Persuader, sling swivels double extractors, which also comes in a light-weight single-barrel size for ladies and juniors - : Marvelous, really, but - : Now over here we're talkin' Damascus, high-carbon Spetnatz shootin' knives, and for that tough up-close-and- personal work, you can always count on your razor-wire/fishing-line garotte when nuthin' else will do [over Kane]: Captain, have you considered the possibility that knives and bullets won't be adequate to the task
: Show him, Kane
[pulling off a shroud to unveil]: That's why we bought these cherry Israeli Army high-octane linear-field flame throwers
: Now  know what you're thinkin', Doc; maybe there's some sort'a spiritual angle to all this
Well, we got that covered, too
185 cell door swings open
Decker and Eigerman look in on the Baptist preacher, Reverend Ashberry
: Reverend Ashberry, your services are required
: He looks like a drunk
: He is; lost his way, poor bastard, [hauling Ashberry to his feet] You wouldn't wanna miss the Day of Judgment, now would you
[seems he's been waiting for this]: The Apocalypse
It's here
: They're warming up for it over in Midian
[leading him out] Padre, you get your pious butt over to church and load up on some Holy Water and crucifixes
we're goin' in there with God on our side
: 186 Boone looks out the window of his cell as a large, unruly posse musters outside in a variety of vehicles
mix of survivalist fanatics in Sons of the Free-labelled camouflage, Marlboro Men with six-shooters, red-neck bozos with their diesel-dyke mamas and heavily made-up bimbos out for a good time
The atmosphere is one of near carnival
Accoutred for combat, Kane and some other cops distribute the weapons
Boone slumps away from the window, his worst fears realized
Reverend Ashberry arrives, lugging six full canteens and an arm-load of crucifixes
He loads into the back of an enclosed, high-tech camper with Eigerman and Decker
Eigerman blows an air-horn, claiming the crowd's attention
: You are all hereby deputized in the name of the law
Now let's kick some ass
Eigerman's truck leads the caravan, which drives off, horns honking, war whoops and liquor-fuelled courage
As the dust clears now, left more or less alone, Lori looks at the police station
beat-up car squeals to a halt in front of her and the front door opens
: Hey, chickie, want a ride
: No
: Please
Lori sees Rachel and gets in the car
187
- Narcisse drives around the block, smoking his cigar
: We have to get Boone out, Midian needs him
: What could he do
: He went into Baphomet's chamber
He spoke with the Baptiser
: And survived; nobody ever did that before
: Perhaps Baphomet told him something, something that could save Midian
: Where they keeping him
: Inside somewhere
He'll be guarded
: He has powers of his own
: Tell me about it; what's happened to him
: He was bitten by a Nightbreed, see, the taint's in his system
: Boone has been turned, he's one of us
: Okay
So what you're saying is, you're saying he's dead
: Hey, some of my best friends are dead
[horrified]:
'm going out of my mind
[to Rachel]: See
told you she'd take it well
188 The posse heads down the road, whoops and hollers emerging from the dust cloud it kicks up
189
' Eigerman cleans his silver-plate Magnum
45, Decker sits beside him holding his briefcase, across from Ashberry, who's frantically paging through an ancient Bible
: Ever performed an exorcism, Father
: No
: Ever seen one
: No
: Well 'd start rehearsin' if  was you
[hands a gun towards Decker] Why don't you hang on to that, Doc
[a little prim]: Oh no,  wouldn't know how to use it
[finds something in the book, reads]: Listen
'So Moses spoke to the people, saying "Arm yourselves for war and let them go and take vengeance for the Lord on Midian
" and so they burned with fire all the cities where they dwelt and killed the kings of Midian, both man and beast
' [with a wink]: Hey, how 'bout that, Doc
Sounds like we're on a crusade against the Devil himself
[not terribly convincing]:  don't believe in the Devil
: Oh
you will
Ashberry looks at Decker; no trace of irony in his expression
Ashberry sorts through the canteens, finds the one that doesn't have a white cross on it, opens it and knocks back two fingers of bourbon
: 190 The sun sinking low in the sky
The shadows are long
191 The station is eerily quiet
Labowitz and an Irish cop, Connie Cormack, guard the cells
Two other cops patrol the end of the corridor
All heavily armed
Labowitz moves to the door of Boone's cell
192
' The spy-hole cover is open
Boone looks up
[from other side of door]: Hey, freak-face, we found your pals
They're gonna fry, just like you
Give us a smile now
Boone stares at the floor, depressed, defeated
193
/ Labowitz chuckles and closes the spy-hole
He walks back down to the coffee station near Eigerman's office, where Cormack is pouring two cups
He takes out a flask, spikes his mug and offers some to Labowitz
: Little Irish in your joe, Constable Labowitz
[a bad brogue]: Don't mind if  do, Constable Cormack
There is a knock on the station door
They look at each other
Cormack picks up his gun and crosses to the door
: Who's there
[
]: Help me, please
: What's wrong
[
]: Accident
We need help
Cormack decides to unbolt the door
On the step stands Rachel, shrouded in black veils
Only her eyes are visible
They fix Cormack
: What's the problem, lady
She drops the veil
The other half of her face has disappeared into smoke
[cont
]: What the blazes
Her costume falls to the ground
Her eyes dissolve
As smoke, Rachel blows into the station
Cormack fires through the smoke, yelling as he does so
[running towards the cell]: Hold 'em, Connie
194 The two other cops hear the shot and run towards the station
Labowitz runs back in with them before they get there, slams and bolts the door
[to the other cops]: Hold your ground
[yells through the door] Cormack
You all right
195 Cormack turns back towards the door, sees Narcisse, screams and fires twice
Narcisse flips one of the bullets out of his chest with a thumb-nail, then leaps onto Cormack, who manages to shoot himself in the foot
Lori enters, slams the door and locks it
Narcisse squats over Cormack, holds his razor-nails under his chin
: Where is he
Where's Boone
: Cell f-f-f-five
through the door
[grins at Lori]:  love a coward
196 Labowitz and the other cops confidently prepare for a siege
[calling back to Boone]: Don't think you're getting sprung, freak
No way they get through that door; solid steel, armour-piercing shells wouldn't even make a dent
Smoke seeps through the key-hole, and from beneath the connecting door
[cont
]: You hear me, freak
No fuckin' way
The smoke from the key-hole begins to form into a face, which floats on a cord of smoke/flesh from the key-hole
The smoke from beneath the door forms into breasts and rib cage, in which a heart beats
Labowitz turns and sees it
[cont
]: Jesus Christ
He empties his gun through the smoke; the two cops on the other side of the smoke are hit and go down
An arm moves towards Labowitz; so does Rachel's face
Her beauty mesmerizes him
Her naked breasts, which float beneath the head, barely connected to it as yet, enchant him even more
: Come closer
don't want to kill you
Her hand presses Labowitz's rifle aside
Rachel's lips touch him
He doesn't resist, but once his mouth is sealed against hers he can't breathe
He tries to raise the rifle, but she dashes it from his hand
Then she snatches the keys from his belt and breaks the kiss
He falls to his knees, gasping
Her body completed and naked, Rachel unlocks the connecting door, then starts looking for Boone
Behind her, as Labowitz reaches for his gun, Narcisse's hand reaches in and grabs his throat
: Naughty, naughty
Labowitz looks up into Narcisse's scarred face and faints
Lori steps past Labowitz to the cell Rachel directs her towards
: We don't have much time
:  know
Lori unlocks the door
197
' [nervous]: Boone
[wakes]: Stay away from me
'll hurt you
:  don't think so
: You know what  did in that room
'm a goddamn cannibal
Stay away
: They're going to come for you
: Let them
Let them find some way to kill me
: You can't die
Midian needs you
: Midian's just a hole in the ground
It's full of things that should lie down and stay dead
: All right
If not for the Breed, then for me
You can't give up on us
: You talk like you're one of them
: Maybe  wish  was
Some little part of me
[she puts her hand on his face] All  know is, 'm not afraid of you
know  should be, but 'm not
still want you, whatever you are
And 'm not going to leave you
If they come for you, then they'll have to kill me too
: No
: So fight
For both of us
For all of us
don't want to be dust
want us flesh and blood
Kiss me
love you
He kisses her
First tentatively, then with great passion
198 Narcisse knocks, calls through the door
: What the hell are you doing in there
: 199
' Fucking, is the answer
They are wound around each other: licking, biting, gasping
Boone thrusts up into her
: Yes
yes
[to himself]: Jesus
Bastard does better dead than  did alive
200 The connecting door flies open, a rejuvenated Boone and Lori move into the office where Narcisse and Rachel are waiting
Narcisse toys with the unconscious Cormack
: Are we going
: About time
: Midian
: All right
: It's about time they saw the truth
201 202 Gibbs, Joyce, Tommy and Pettine wait outside the gates
Pettine paces
Joyce looks at his watch, moves over to Pettine and speaks quietly
: How long until dark
: Two hours
Two and a half
told 'em to bring gasoline
We'll burn the bastards out
: Has it occurred to you maybe we've got this all wrong
We could be destroying
don't know, a whole new species
: You saw that fucker below, Lieutenant, same as me
That damn thing was just too weird to live
: Maybe they're just different
: Isn't that enough reason
Joyce stares at him
In background, Tommy starts to holler
Pettine calls
[cont
]: What is it
Tommy is pointing frantically at a dust cloud in the distance
203 violent cut to the roar of engines as we track with the fast- moving posse
Eigerman stands up out of a skylight in the cab of his truck, eggs on the other vehicles with a rebel war cry
: Yee-hah
204 As the caravan appears
Ecstasy
Tommy and Gibbs dance a jig together
: It's the fuckin' cavalry
The posse speeds down towards the Necropolis gates
205 Narcisse's beat-up car speeds down the highway towards Midian
: How much further
:  mile, maybe two
We close in on Rachel, who stares ahead of her, as if in a trance
: We're too late
: Hang on
Steering hard, he veers the car off the road and into thick woods
Branches thrash against the windshield
[cont
]: This is a shortcut
206 The posse is busily at work around the Necropolis, Eigerman and Kane supervising
Some are laying trails of gasoline through the pathways
Others are simply patrolling, guns in hand
There is an air of nervous anticipation
Ashberry comes round a tomb and we follow him down a walkway, staring in awe at the mausoleums and statuary
Looking at a particularly large tomb, Ashberry's eye is captivated by a large, fantastically rendered marble winged angel
He approaches it, reaches up to touch it
The angel, a monster, turns to look at him with sad, impassive gravity
Then we see its shadow on Ashberry's face and hear the slow, thick beating of its wings as it flies off
Ashberry's stunned
He fumbles the top of his bourbon canteen off, takes a long drink, then stops when he sees a load of dynamite taped to the side of the tomb
He follows the wire that leads off it to another dynamite pack on an adjacent tomb and then another
He's panicked
207 Kane is escorting Eigerman and Pettine down a pathway, pointing out the posse's handiwork
:
packets of plastique at every intersection, trip wires outside the biggest tombs, we figure those'll be the major escape routes
: How much longer
: Five minutes
[into walkie-talkie]: Let's pull back to the perimeter before we lose the light
We've got movement underground; they're hearing it round the walls
[approaching them from the side]: Captain
: Jesus, not there,
[Ashberry freezes] We got Claymores planted in the rosebushes, Reverend, cut your nuts off faster'n a hedge clipper
: We've made a mistake, there are Angels here, a heavenly host
: You're drunk, asshole
Ashberry dumps the bourbon out of his canteen
: No
Listen to me, it's wrong, it's sacrilege, this is holy ground
: Get the hell up that hill, you pinhead
: You brought me here because 'm a man of God
: That's right; hang round here a couple more minutes, Padre, and you'll be sitting at his left hand
Now get your sorry ass out of the fuckin' way
Eigerman backhands him
Ashberry falls
Eigerman, Kane, Pettine and the other cops begin to pull back
Ashberry looks up, as he hears grindings and growls in the earth
Boone is lifting off the top of a nearby tomb
Ashberry is about to shoot when Narcisse grabs him around the throat, puts a finger to his lips and signals him to be quiet
Narcisse follows Boone into the tomb
The tomb-lid scrapes as it's pushed back into place from beneath
Ashberry starts to pray
207A Boone and Narcisse move through the panicking underground, creatures fleeing in every direction
Boone sees Lylesburg, trying to keep the panic down, moves towards him
: Stay down
Stay where you are, they're waiting for us above
[intercepting him]: No
if you stay here you'll be slaughtered
: This is our home
: Not anymore
: We belong here
: Listen to me, old man, the rules change; if you want to live it won't be here and it won't be by your laws
Other creatures have stopped, watching the confrontation
Boone speaks to them as well
[cont
]: If you'want to survive we've got to fight back, we can't hide anymore
[to Lylesburg] What's it gonna be
Lylesburg slumps, acquiescing, unable to refuse Boone's assertions
[cont
] [to Narcisse]: Get the children above ground, find a hiding place
[to the others] Get ready to fight
[to Lylesburg] What about Baphomet
Can he be moved
: Yes
It could be done
: It must be done
Brothers and sisters, it's time to fight
207A Leroy and Lude listen to Boone on the bridge
: You hear what he said
: What chance have we got
They're armed
[opens jacket]: So am
Two one-eyed snakes, nesting in Leroy's belly, slide up from his innards and wrap around his neck
: They call us monsters, remember
They're afraid of us
Let's give 'em reason
: It's a long time since  spilled blood
: You never lose the knack
208 From this high vantage point, Decker watches the preparations below through binoculars, with the glee of a pyromaniac at a fire-storm
The sun is setting
He stares up at it, squinting into its brightness
[
]:
'm waiting
Philip
Decker looks towards the patrol car parked nearby
The front door is open
On the passenger seat sits his briefcase
Decker quickly crosses to the car
: Be quiet
[
]: Let me out, Philip
There's going to be bloodshed
want to see
Decker opens the briefcase
The mask and his knives are laid out inside
: Ah, that's better
: We can't let anyone see us
:  want to be free
[
]: Decker
Decker swings round, slamming the case shut, as Joyce approaches
: Lieutenant
[covering flawlessly] You gave me such a start
: Eigerman's invited you to watch from the command post
: Oh,  don't think 'm up to it, really
:
've got a bad feeling about this
: Believe me, Lieutenant, whoever or whatever's living down there deserves what's coming
: Monsters, you mean
: Unnatural, misbegotten creatures
:  don't know
The only monsters 've ever seen had a human face
As Joyce looks down at the Necropolis, Decker sneaks an anxious side- long glance at his briefcase
209 The final explosives-layers exit, their backs covered by flamethrower and machine-gun-carrying mob members
distraught Ashberry is the last out
Midian is now completely deserted
Dandelion seeds drift down the walkways, caught in shafts of sunlight
210
/ Eigerman, Pettine and Kane, looking at their watches
[a pause  then]:
-minus fifteen seconds
ten, nine,eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
: Go
Kane depresses the detonator
There are two large explosions, followed by several smaller ones
Part of the Necropolis wall is blasted out
Several members of the posse retreat
Eigerman pulls his pistol
[cont
]: You there, stand your ground
[fires a warning shot] Stand your ground, damn you
The defectors stop
Several more chain explosions in Necropolis
211 212 213 Narcisse is leading a group of child monsters, as the explosions bring earth plunging down from the ceiling
Babies cry
Monsters scream
We see several creatures howling in bestial terror
Babette is separated from Narcisse's group by falling earth, nearly trampled in the chaos
She is picked up by the dog-faced man
:  want my mother
: We'll find her
213A
' Peloquin squats on the step overlooking the fire-pit, listening to the sound of invasion from above
There is a mixture of fear and rage on his face
In the darkness opposite, Kinski
: We began this
:  just wanted meat
didn't know he was going to cause this
: There were prophesies
The seventh saviour
:  didn't believe the prophesies and  didn't obey the Law
You want to see me bleed for it
All right, 'll bleed
He exits the chamber
214
/ Smoke billows over the walls
Eigerman moves closer to the gates, listening to the wild cries from inside
He grabs Ashberry by the collar
: That sound like a heavenly choir to you, Padre
:  have to see
Ashberry shakes himself free and heads through the gates, into the Necropolis
Eigerman turns to the others, lights a cigar
: Pettine
: Chief
: We're moving in
[locks and loads his machine-gun]: Yes, sir
[turns - addresses the posse] We're movin' in
Car engines are revved, headlights turned on, piercing the smoke
215 Ashberry wanders through the Necropolis as the Breed begin to emerge on every side
The air is full of sad, melodious sounds, like whale-song
Ghostly forms appear from the smoke and drift towards him
[in awe]: Dear Lord
Some of the creatures brush him as they drift by: their strange beauty entrances him
: Dear Lord
Forgive me
There are images here which have the flavour of Christian iconography
Mother and child
man bleeding from his brow creature with a halo of smoke
He wanders on
216 217 Decker watches impassively
Joyce moves towards the gate
As he reaches it an extraordinary creature appears
: My God
It means no harm
Joyce steps aside and the creature moves off into the night
We cut back to Decker
[
]: Don't deny me Philip
: Soon
promise
Decker hears shouts to his flank, steps back, out of sight and sees Lori and Rachel emerge from a hiding place, Lori trying to restrain Rachel from going in
: Babette
: Rachel, no
Rachel breaks away and runs towards the Necropolis
Lori is alone
[
]: Now, perfect, finish her
She's the only one who knows about us
: What about Boone
[
]: Boone's a monster
They all die tonight
[smiles]: All right
[
]: Quickly, Philip, we'll lose her
The briefcase is opened
The light of distant fires flicker on the mask
218 218A Boone and Narcisse lead the column of Breed, children and babies up from underground into the Necropolis itself
: Hurry up
: Is this wise
Coming above ground
: If we stay below they'll slaughter us
: This is their territory
: No
The night's ours
Now get the rest of the children up here, 'm going to find a clear way through
He heads away, leaving a frightened group of Breed and children
218B Peloquin appears overground, scanning the destruction before racing off
219 Eigerman addresses the assembled posse
: They're coming out, and they're armed, so watch yourselves
It's a fucking freak-show in there
We're not taking prisoners
It's us or them
Let's clean up
The engines rev, and the posse charges the gates
The lead vehicle, driven by a manic, grinning Kane, rams the gates, and crashes through
: Us or them
Us or them
On the other side of the gates, Peloquin appears in Kane's headlights
: Shit
Peloquin jumps up into the air as the car careers towards him
We see him somersault in the air
Kane hears him land on the car roof
We see Peloquin on the roof, bend over the windshield
His face appears in front of a panicking Kane, the mouth suddenly opening grotesquely wide
Kane slams the breaks on
Peloquin is thrown off
: Eat dirt, fucker
Peloquin is thrown to the ground, his face caught in the blaze of headlights as Kane's vehicle revs and drives at him
[ecstatic]: Yeah
His momentum carries the car towards the crater blown in the ground
Kane's pleasure turns to horror
: Oh shit
Shit
He turns to swerve, but too late, the car heads over the edge
Wounded, Peloquin crawls off
219A Dirt falls from the roof
Headlights appear
219B
' The car slides into the earth
The guns stacked behind him fall forward
: Oh my Jesus
219C Kane's car drops through the roof of Midian, falling through the core, breaking bridges as it falls
Breed are thrown off walkways to their deaths
The car strikes the top of Baphomet's chamber and a plume of fire, followed by several small explosions, marks Kane's death
219D
' The explosions rock the chamber
Dirt falls
Baphomet looks towards the roof, with great sadness on his face
219E Boone enters the initiation chamber
Lylesburg is standing beside the bowl of Baphomet's blood, which is bubbling furiously
: What the hell are you doing down here
We need help
: This was intended
: Fuck that
We're not going to lie down and die
: It's Baphomet's will
He's going to destroy the Naturals, and us
Everything, in one last fire
: How do you know
: Look for yourself
He points to the bowl
: It's going to blow
: Yes
: He'll destroy his own people
: Better it ends quickly
We can't escape them
We remind them of the darkness in themselves
They hate that
: So did
learned better
We can make it out
But  need fighters
: We're not warriors
: What about the Berserkers
: They're uncontrollable
: All the better
Let them out
Don't just stand there
We're the tribes of the moon, remember
Doubt and fear mingle in Lylesburg's look, but he finally nods his head
: 'll release the Berserkers
: Be quick
We haven't got forever
Yet
Lylesburg smiles
Boone leaves
The Drummer is at the door
: You come with me
The rest of you get out of here
He exits with the Drummer
219F The posse enter in large numbers, firing to left and right
We see Breed shot down
219G Boone races to the entrance, to see Eigerman's posse moving towards the Necropolis
One of the posse has a flame thrower
He burns up the foliage
From Boone's
we view the enemy: grinning sweating monsters
There's no way out in this direction
219H Lori looks towards the conflagration
: Oh Jesus, Boone
Behind her, we see a familiar, masked figure approaching: Decker
She doesn't hear him over the shouts and screams
219I One of the posse fires a rocket into a giant Breed who explodes
Boone reacts with horror at the destruction
When he turns back he sees Breed watching too, defenceless
: Arm yourselves
Defend yourselves
You're not cattle, for Christ's sake
They don't have any right to kill you
He races back the way he came, and pulls coffins from the walls, tearing their lids off with supernatural strength
He breaks the wood into clubs
The Breed watch him
: Weapons
You need weapons or it's over
One or two understand, and do as he's doing
: All of you
They do as he orders
: Stop them getting in
They'll kill the children
219J Lori turns to see Decker appearing from the darkness
He attacks her, cutting her arm
She backs away before he can strike a second time, retreating towards the gates
Then she turns and walks through the reeds; Decker on her heels
219K The posse led by Pettine invade the entrances to the Necropolis, engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the Breed
219L Boone races through the Necropolis, finding that other posse members are breaking in from other sides
: They're everywhere
219M The Nightbreed children hear the sound of slaughter approaching
One of the Breed with enormous, dark eyes, speaks
: We can't stay here
: He told us to
: He can't help us
He's too late
219N We see the posse shooting Breed as they move towards the children
Several are entering doorways that lead underground
2190 Posse enter the core, firing at anything that moves
219P
' Lylesburg, his leg broken, is hobbling towards the Berserkers' chamber, as the sound of gunfire gets nearer
219Q Narcisse still keeps an increasingly panicked group of Breed and children from scattering
Pettine and two bloodied, grinning posse appear through the smoke
: Look what we got here
freak-show nursery school
The group back away, but two more posse members appear, one with a flame-thrower, another with grenades
: Say goodnight
[from above]: Goodnight
Pettine looks up
Framed against the stars, Boone
He drops on Pettine breaking the man's neck
Then he and Narcisse lead the attack against the posse, dispatching them all
: What way's safe
: The west wall
But be quick
'm going after Eigerman
219R Leroy and Lude hide around the corner of a mausoleum
Two posse members are beating a Breed up with their rifle butts
Leroy heads out to help
: What's the plan
: The usual
You take the big guy
[he yells to the Naturals] Hey
They turn
Leroy raises his hands in surrender
:  wouldn't do that if  were you
1ST : Give me a good reason why not
: 'll give you two
The snakes emerge from his body
1ST : Shit
He raises his gun, but Lude flips over his head, landing behind him and in front of the 2nd posse member
Lude's eyes blaze
: Pretty gun
The 2nd posse member looks down at his hands
The gun is covered in snakes
He drops the gun
When he looks up Lude has gone
He turns again, backing off towards a monument
Lude is there, a living devil hidden amongst the carved variety
He takes hold of the man, turning him round and driving his horns into the man's neck
He staggers back, blood pouring from the opened wounds
Leroy, meanwhile, draws the 1st into an embrace
The snakes strike
Poisoned, the man dies
: Look at this mess
: Just like the old days
219S Kane leads two cops through the mayhem, firing to right and left
He shoots a Breed against one of the mausoleums
Blood is spattered on his face
: Look at these bastards
Fucking freaks
He wipes the blood from his face
Then he takes off his spectacles, and wipes the blood off them
As he does so 1st cop yelps
1ST : Yow
: What
1st cop pulls a quill from the back of his neck
1ST : Where the fuck did that come from
Kane puts his spectacles back on, and sees Shuna Sassi in one of the mausoleums
She moves sexily in the shadows
Kane grins and starts to approach
2ND : Wait
: It's just a girl
1st cop is still rubbing the back of his neck
He is looking sick now
1ST :  don't
feel
so
good
Kane pushes the mausoleum grille open, as the 1st cop kneels over, face down
The 2nd cop kneels to help him
Meanwhile, Kane has stepped into the mausoleum
Shuna is in the corner, her spines covered with the swaths of red cloth
: It's , Baby
He lowers his gun
Outside the 2nd cop turns the 1st over
He is frothing at the mouth, his face blotchy and sweating
2ND : Oh shit
Kane
Inside again, Shuna drops her cloth and leaps at Kane
2nd cop now approaches the mausoleum
2ND : Kane
As he reaches the threshold, Kane staggers out, his body and face pierced in dozens of places with Shuna's spines
He reaches for 2nd cop
2ND : Keep away from me
In panic, he fires at Kane, who falls to the ground
As the smoke clears a hand appears and strokes his cheek
He turns
It's Shuna
He screams, and falls to the ground at her feet, his arm covered in spines
He twitches, and dies
She drops her swath of red cloth over the faces of the three dead men
220-224 225 Cut to Eigerman's leering, grinning face as he fires at Breed
Ashberry emerges from the shadows and grabs him
:
Please, you've got to stop
[takes out a pistol - points it) There's children down there, you're killing children
: Go ahead, faggot, [pauses contemptuously] You haven't got the balls to pull the trigger
Eigerman snatches the gun away and pistol-whips him to the ground
Eigerman draws a bead on Ashberry's forehead
[cont
]: Lemme show you how it's done
Nearby, Joyce sees them, draws his weapon, ready to fire at Eigerman when a shadow passes over him
He ducks, his expression changing from horror to wonder
[eyes closed-hands clasped fervently]: Father,  am heartily sorry for having offended thee
: Sorry, Padre
Nobody's listening
[prepares to shoot] [
]:  hear you
Eigerman turns, looks and fires as Boone leaps at him
He roars, effortlessly picks Eigerman up and body-slams him against the wall of Midian
[cont
] [to Ashberry]: Get up
: Don't kill me
: Run, go on
We don't like priests here
Ashberry pulls at his collar, tears it off, clings to Boone
: No, no, take me,  have to see
Boone gets a sense of his commitment
He heads off
Ashberry follows
And, at a distance, so does Joyce
226 Boone races through the walkways, Ashberry following
There is pitched hand-to-hand battle on every side
Nightbreed are prevailing in some; in others the mob repeats scenes from the history we witnessed earlier: Breed being beaten or burned to death, impaled on stakes
Boone assists some along the way, pulling off their assailants
227 Lori enters the Necropolis, running through the smoke
Decker follows
: Boone
Boone
228A 229
' Lylesburg has reached the door of the Berserkers' chamber
He puts the key in the lock
shout stops him turning it
He looks towards a man with a laser-sight rifle
: Yo
The light from the rifle plays on Lylesburg's robes
: Watch the pretty light
It moves up towards Lylesburg's face, until it's centred on his forehead
The man fires, killing his victim
Lylesburg falls, hanging from the door by the key chain around his neck
His many eyes have opened
The man grins
Then hears a noise behind him
He turns to see the Ferreol Vees, creatures like Manta Rays that glide through the air, appearing around the corner
They swoop towards him, separating
The middle one opens its mouth as it strikes his face
He is eclipsed
When the Vees pass on down the corridor, the man's face is a bloody wreck
He falls to the floor, just out of reach of the Berserkers, who roar their frustration
230 Boone and Ashberry are on one of the walkways, which are swinging violently
Boone hears the Berserkers' roar, and heads towards the door that leads into their corridor, leaving Ashberry on the bridge, tears pouring down his face
Then he follows Boone
As he reaches the ledge he looks back to see a fabulous beast, the Mezzick-Muul, and its beautiful rider, Diadaria, appear
He watches, awestruck
230A Lori races through the smoke and horror of the Necropolis, as Decker follows
231
' Boone reaches the door
Lylesburg is dead
Boone pulls the key from off Lylesburg's neck, and pulls the corpse aside
Then he turns the key in the lock
The door opens
rush of filthy wind emerges from the chamber beyond
Then the Berserkers appear: lethal brutes, all teeth, armour and muscle
One of them, Ghost, takes hold of Boone, and there's a beat when it seems certain to dispatch him
Then a burst of light from Baphomet's chamber spills over them, and there's a roar from their unseen God
They let Boone go, and they're away
Boone looks towards the chamber, then heads back towards the surface
232-235 236 Tommy leads a line of five posse members who have cornered a number of wounded Breed against one of the walls
One of the creatures attempts to scramble away
Tommy guns him down
He turns to the other gunmen
: Watch this
The two posse members prepare to kill the Breed
The ground around them begins to shudder, and a fist bursts out of the ground and grabs the leg of a posse member and drags him down
Another fist then bursts out of the ground
Then in silhouette the Berserkers climb out of the earth beside the posse
Two of the posse turn, and fire at the Berserkers, who advance through the hail of the bullets, and quickly dispatch the two gunmen
Tommy has begun to fire at the feet of the cornered Breed, obliging them to dance
[laughs]: Dance, fuckers
The display gets appreciative hoots and laughter from the three surviving posse members, who - like Tommy - are as yet unaware that the Berserkers are advancing on them
Tommy continues to fire at the ground around the Breed, as one by one his three companions are dispatched by the Berserkers
We close in on Tommy, whose face is suddenly spattered with blood
He stops firing
He looks round to find himself surrounded by Berserkers
The shadows fall over him
Their hands take hold of him
We see the shadow of what they do to him on the walls: his body is torn apart
We cut to the Berserkers
Ghost has Tommy's gun, with the hand still attached
He tosses it aside, roaring like King Kong
The wounded Breed hurry away as the Berserkers head off in search of new mischief
237 With the tide turning inside the Necropolis, a disorganized retreat is underway
Eigerman is at the gate watching the remains of his 'army' staggering away
Joyce is watching the scene
: Stand your ground
Stand your ground
They've got to come this way
We can mow 'em down
He climbs up on a vehicle which is parked at the gates
In the driving seat is Gibbs
Beside him, a woman, her face smoke-stained, her expression near catatonic
: Gibbs
: Sir
: Lights
Gibbs switches the lights on, to pierce the smoke
Bad move
The illumination shows the Berserkers appearing
They approach the vehicle
: Shit
Eigerman jumps from the vehicle, as the retreating posse fire at the Berserkers
It's a useless response
Bloodied but unbowed, the Berserkers run at the vehicles
The woman throws herself out, but Gibbs isn't quick enough
One of the Berserkers pushes the vehicle up the wall of the Necropolis, and Blatz, a small, vicious creature, stamps on the roof
Inside, Gibbs cowers as the roof is beaten in
He is crushed
Joyce, who has been watching this entire scene, moves away from the gate towards the Necropolis
The fires are dying down somewhat, and an eerie half-light bathes the scene he moves through
few surviving posse hurry away, firing at every movement in the shadows
Back at the gate we see one of the escaping Berserkers flip another car over, while his brothers dispatch posse members
The survivors simply drop their weapons and flee
237A 237B 238 The dog-faced man lies dead at the door and beside him Babette, her face subtly bestial
Joyce hears Babette weeping; her cries hit him hard
He goes to her, gathers her up gently in his arms
Babette clings to him; he sees her arms are partially transformed into claws, but he keeps holding her
Boone emerges from the depths, into the wrecked mausoleum
: Boone
[he goes to them] Lori
She's hurt
: Where
Babette points outside
239 Lori runs, Decker follows, his steps steady, relentless and gaining
Lori takes another stride and the ground gives way beneath her
She slides down into the earth
240 Boone is tracking them, Joyce following, carrying Babette, who has a vision
: Falling
241 Chaos, and collapse
Earth is falling all around
Lori picks herself up and finds her way back up is blocked by debris
She has no choice but to cross the swaying walkways, while the air thickens with dust and smoke
There are only one or two Breed left alive down here, desperately collecting their belongings
They exit the chamber leaving the smoking bowls
We track towards the bowls, as the contents brighten and bubble
241A Lori descends a flight of stairs, to find Peloquin badly wounded at the bottom
: It's all over
didn't believe the prophesies and now it's all over
: What prophesies
Peloquin takes her arm
: You want to see
241B Peloquin pushes Lori ahead of him
: See
We track towards the mural
Lori can barely believe her eyes
Here, laid out on the walls, is a whole history; and featured amongst its more recent additions, the face of Boone
: Yes, it's him
Boone squatting in front of his fire of love letters
Boone dead in the reeds
: All these years waiting for a saviour
But he hasn't saved us
He's destroyed us
made him, and he's destroyed us
: Made him
: The bite was mine
The bite that mocks death
: That doesn't make him yours
belong here on this wall, just as much as you do
Why aren't  here
: You're still a Natural
Go back while you've still got a life
Join your tribe
: That
My tribe
Not any longer
: Then die with us
It's over
Peloquin exits
Lori looks back at the images on the walls once more
Then she exits
242 Boone, Joyce and Babette approach the hole where Lori fell
: Let me down
can't go any further
: Why not
[looking down into the hole]: Baphomet
[to Joyce]: Take her
Run
Joyce nods and moves off with her into the smoke
As she disappears, Decker steps forward from the smoke
: Quite a dance, huh
Death everywhere and you and me in the middle
Catch
He throws the head of a Breed at Boone
: Even the dead can die
Then Decker strikes out at him, slashing at Boone's face
Boone falls backwards
At the last moment he catches hold of Decker, pulling him down into the hole and together they tumble into the earth
243 244 Boone and Decker land on one of the rope bridges
Boone heads across it, pursued by Decker, who slashes at his neck, cutting him
: Almost
Boone falls back
Decker closes on him, the knives at his neck
The force of his stabs, which miss Boone's neck, break the boards of the bridge
Boone braces his feet beneath Decker and tosses him over
Decker gets up and approaches him again, slashing the ropes of the bridge with his blades as he comes
The fighters connect and struggle, their violent motion carrying them over the edge of the bridge, dropping them down another level
Decker lands very heavily, and lies still
Boone gets up
His exit along the bridge in one direction is blocked
He has to step past Decker who doesn't move
Only when Boone has stepped beyond him does Decker get up, pursuing Boone across the bridge, and flinging one of the knives at his victim's back
The blade cuts straight through Boone, sticking out from his chest a good six inches
He turns, his fury transforming him into a more extreme creature
Decker comes at Boone with a second blade, slashing at Boone's neck
The battle carries them off the bridge onto the stairs
Decker takes hold of Boone's hair, preparing to deliver the coup de grace
Boone reaches for a weapon, finds a skull, and smashes it into the mask
Decker lets go
Boone tumbles off the stairs, falling face down on a card table
Decker follows down the stairs
Boone pulls the table off his chest, leaving the Ace of Hearts on the blade in his chest
Decker follows through, driving Boone back into one of the Breed's rooms, where the fight continues
Decker takes a whip from the wall and uses it to disarm Boone, who has snatched up a bone to defend himself with
Boone snatches up a second bone and retaliates, delivering blow after blow against Decker, eventually knocking the knife from his hand and driving him out on to the ledge once more
Decker teeters on the edge, now defenceless
Boone approaches
: Want to dance
He snatches the mask off Decker's face and draws him close, impaling Decker on his own blade
Decker screams
Then Boone pushes him off the blade, and over the edge of the ledge
Decker falls
Boone stands on the ledge, and spits down at the corpse
As he does so he hears the same roar from Baphomet that called the Berserkers from harming him
Out of it, comes Baphomet's face
[
]: Boone
244A
' The chamber is empty of life
There are two or three corpses on the floor
We approach the central dais, on which is perched the statue of Baphomet, surrounded by six white heads
Momentarily, lines of light break from the statue's head and strike the white heads, which in turn begin to glow
244B In the chambers we've seen before we see copies of the six statues, in front of which are bowls of Baphomet's fluid
They begin to glow, the brightness building
Sparks rise from the fluid
245
' Lori sits, exhausted, in the corridor
She looks up to see Boone, with the knife still transfixing him
: My God
: Decker's dead
Take the knife out
Lori pulls the knife from him, and throws it down
[
]: Boone
: Don't go
: 'm
responsible
have to
Lori and Boone head down the corridor, passing Ashberry, who is standing in the shadows
Lori and Boone head down the stairs towards the chamber
246
' Blinding light
As Boone descends into the chamber, he sees eight Nightbreed, surviving members of a Senior Council, Rachel among them, standing around Baphomet
They are wrapping severed limbs of Baphomet, preparing to include him in the exodus
His head and shoulders remain suspended in the light
Baphomet's lips move, making a terrible, eloquent sound
Rachel translates, the deep voice we hear coming from her lips
/: Come closer
Boone obeys
Baphomet's remaining arm reaches down and holds Boone, as Baphomet's face stares down at him
/:
You have destroyed our refuge
:  never meant
Baphomet silences him
Boone trembles but maintains eye contact
/: This was foretold
No refuge is forever
But you are charged
: Yes
/:
You must rebuild what you've destroyed
: Where
/: That you must find yourself
In the world above
:  don't
don't know how
/: You shall not be alone
You will find me there and heal me
[holds him close] You are not Boone
And now the words emerge from Baphomet himself, shaking the chamber
:
you are Cabal
Boone/Cabal is released
Baphomet is consumed in light
The Council move towards him to finish their task
[
]: Boone
Boone/Cabal turns; Lori stands at the bottom of the slope, offering a hand
He takes it, they start up the slope
Cowering in a niche inside the chamber, out of sight, watching in wonder is Ashberry
Transfixed by Baphomet, he crosses himself
Boone/Cabal glances back
The Council receive pieces of Baphomet from the light wrapping his smoking fragments in shrouds
The light builds to its brightest level
Pieces of ceiling begin to fall
246A The bowls start to explode with sparks of white light
247 Boone/Cabal and Lori race up towards the surface, as Midian continues to collapse around them
248
' Ashberry descends the stairs into the blaze of light
Tears pour down his cheeks
He watches as the Council prepare to take down Baphomet's head
Near to him is one of the bowls of Baphomet's light
Ashberry approaches it, hungry for a taste of this glory
He reaches to touch the bowl
As he does so Baphomet's eyes fix on him
The bowl flips in the air
The fluid it holds rains down on Ashberry like acid
He falls back, his body smoking
249 Boone/Cabal and Lori reach the surface and race through the ruined Necropolis, flames all around them
And then, behind them
250
' The tentacles attached to Baphomet's head are detached
The blaze of light instantly begins to diminish
250A The lights start to go out in the core, and earth begins to pour from the tunnels
We see it flood the various corridors, with a shuddering roar
250B
' We glimpse Baphomet's head being covered by the Council, as the roars increase
: 251 Boone/Cabal and Lori find Joyce, holding Babette, protecting her, near the gates
Joyce steps back from the form of Rachel, who pulls her veils around her and holds out her arms
: Give me my child
Joyce looks at Lori, Boone/Cabal, at Babette and Rachel
He tenderly hands the child over
Rachel holds Babette and they both disappear into the darkness
[to Boone/Cabal]:
never understood
nobody ever told me
He steps away from them and the night engulfs him
: 252 The earth has almost obliterated the core entirely
253 The roar ceases
Silence
254 Lori and Boone stand in the reeds as the last, bright bloom of the fires dies away on their faces
Figures move away through the smoke, creatures we recognize
The drummer beats out a tattoo as they depart
Narcisse appears from the darkness
As he does so, a final explosion roars up from the underground
In the smoke pillar above the site, Baphomet's image momentarily appears before the wind disperses it
: Never piss off a God
Lori looks up into the sky
: Lori's
of the sky, with other Breed, spirits of smoke and light, moving away into the night
: Where are they going
: Any hiding place they can find
It'll be dawn soon
: When  need you where will  find you
: You'll find me
And you will need me
He reaches to shake Boone's hand
: Never touched a legend before
He laughs his manic laugh
[cont
] [to Lori]: Good night, pretty
He fades into the night, the laughter going with him
255 In the distance, the burning ruins of Midian
The wind sighs in the moonlit reeds
Cabal and Lori reach the top of the hill, turn and look down, standing apart
: 'll have to start tonight
: 'll go with you, Boone
: 'm not Boone, Lori
Do you understand
belong to the Breed now
: Then make me belong too; they made you one of them, you can do it to me
:  can't
:  want to be with you
: 'll come back for you when 'm finished
: And when's that gonna be, when 'm ninety and you're still the way you are
went through hell to find you and you just, just walk away from me
[pause; broken-hearted] Well go on, then, just go
Go on
What more do you want
Leave me some dignity, for Christ's sake
Pause
She turns away, trying not to show him her pain
Cabal turns to go
Lori turns back, sees him going
She can't bear it, looks around, sees Decker's briefcase lying beside the police car
Runs to it, finds a knife
: Boone
He turns
She puts the blade to her belly and drives it in
: Lori,
She cries out and sinks to the ground in terrible pain
He reaches her and holds her in his arms
:  lied,  lied, you're all  want
: Don't die, God, Lori, don't die
: Well why don't you do something about it, God damn it
remember what you said
[fading]
quickly
He raises her neck to his mouth
Her eyes flicker closed
He bites
fatal, bloody kiss
He rises from her
Her eyes are closed
:
too late
Oh God, too late
Her eyes open
She's turned
: You said you'd never leave me
She grins, presses up to kiss his bloodied mouth
Camera moves up off them to find the moon and we: : 255A We track through the ruins of the Necropolis
The walls are blackened by fires that are almost extinguished; corpses [human and Breed] lie in barely distinguishable bundles, from which partially cremated limbs jut
Smoke hangs in the air
From the distance we see Eigerman, going amongst the corpses, reclaiming guns, bullets and grenades
As we get closer we realize that he is a broken man, his face dirty, his eyes lunatic
He's been crying, the tracks marking the dirt
Suddenly, he hears a noise, and stands up to see a large figure appearing from the smoke
He goes for his own gun, levelling it at the figure as it approaches
: Keep your distance
The figure keeps coming, emerging from the smoke
It's Ashberry
He has been transformed by the confrontation with Baphomet
His hair has been almost burned away entirely and there is a subtle reconfiguration in the shape of his skull
His clothes are in tatters
There are hints that his once broken body, poisoned by alcohol, has taken on new strength
He looks as insane as Eigerman, but stronger in his lunacy
There's a dangerous fervour in his eyes
:  saw their God
saw him
: What the hell are you talking about
:  can still smell him
He's out there
Ashberry walks past Eigerman towards the exit from Necropolis
: You mean you can find them
: Oh yes
: We'll go together then
You can lead me to the bastards
Then 'll wipe them all away
: No
They're mine
Their God burned me
want to burn him back
All of them
Burn them all away
: You can't, you don't have the wits
Ashberry turns on him, his face wild
He takes hold of Eigerman by the neck, his fingers digging into the muscle
Blood runs
Eigerman tries to raise the gun but Ashberry takes hold of the man's hand, and summarily snaps his wrist
The gun is dropped
Ashberry starts to lift Eigerman up off the ground
The policeman's flailings stop suddenly
The head lolls
Ashberry flings the body aside, and starts out of the Necropolis
As he approaches the exit he looks up
Sunlight falls on his face
: 256 Shining, full
We move down to find a derelict barn, standing alone in a vast field
: 257 We track through the darkness to find Rachel, Babette, Kinski and a number of other refugees and children of Midian, staring out at the night
:
who will come for us
: His name is Cabal
He unmade Midian
: How soon
: On the next wind
If not tonight, then tomorrow
Babette gazes out over the cornfields
: On the next wind
: 258 Cabal and Lori, standing on the hill, against a background of stars
[
]:
if not tonight
tomorrow
: 259 Moving through the ruined chambers, illuminated by dying flickers of flame, we find and track along the end of the heroic mosaic/mural
It tells, in a rush of images, the story of the ruin of Midian
Camera comes to a stop on the final image: Cabal and Lori, as we just saw them, on a hill, framed against the star-filled heavens
The sound of the wind
Fade to black
