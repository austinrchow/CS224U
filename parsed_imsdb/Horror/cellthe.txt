Sitting on the bed with Edward is  , an elegantly dressed woman in her mid-40's
There is a soulfulness to her, but the husband,  , 60's, possesses the icy demeanor of a corporate tycoon

Ella smiles and caresses Edward's hair
He needs a haircut

Catherine, we've waited eighteen months for signs of progress
There's been progress
Yes, but there is no proof the procedure works

Catherine is hurt and vulnerable due to exhaustion and the intensity of her experience with Edward, but feels she must defend herself

Anne seems to know what's coming
She presses against the wall, removes her arms from the sleeves of the sweater, hunches down, and raises the garment over her head, forming a tent

There is no steam, so this water must be cold
Shaking, Anne whispers a count to herself - "One-one thousand, two-one thousand, three

The spray hits everything in the room - mirror, toilet, floor - and a food wrapper drifts toward the drain

Because we've been reactive, that's why
And we need to be active
Miriam reaches for Catherine's wrist and takes her pulse

Shush
As Miriam examines her, Catherine continues: He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play

If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him

Miriam takes a penlight and examines Catherine's eyes
Besides,  don't know what it might do to you
You're already exhausted

Catherine nods

Catherine shakes her head no
Miriam shuts off the penlight and looks at Catherine with professional and personal concern

Any more nightmares
(defensively) No
Good
We need you healthy and relaxed
You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television
Yes mother

Balance, dear girl, is the key

She taps Catherine's head

Okay
Miriam gathers her belongings
Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about
Want to come

Besides, want to get to bed early

As if in a beatific trance, the driver moves to the window and gently rests his palm on the glass
Arms flailing, mouth gasping, eyes filled with dread
The last spark of life
The driver , startled and frightened
Almost shamefully, he turns and hides, unable to look at her
Suddenly, his body tenses and writhes, as if seized by torturous pain
He opens his mouth in a silent scream
And then, quickly as it came, the pain subsides
Hidden in shadow, he breathes deeply, regaining self-control
He waits, then moves back to the glass
Anne's dead face floats past him
Almost angelic
He watches her and leans his head against the window, closer
And the driver catches his own reflection in the mirror

'  - Small and isolated, the nearest neighbor a block away
'  - The place is a mess
Computer print-outs, dirty dishes, unopened mail, videotapes, and notepads cover tables, chairs and floor
On the crammed bookshelves, psychology texts sit next to volumes on mythology, religion, and the occult
Totems, figurines and artifacts (Central and South American in origin) adorn the walls and tables
As Portishead plays on the stereo, we find Catherine suffering from insomnia, wearing goofy-yet-hip eyeglasses, sweatpants and a  -shirt, sharing a late-night snack with her pet
She shuts the refrigerator door and we linger on an odd  taped to the surface

Stargher gives him a chew toy and locks the dog inside before moving to the tub
Soaking in the bleach is the nude corpse of Anne Vicksey
The interior of the tub is glazed with gleaming porcelain and the whiteness of her flesh makes it appear as though she is floating in nothingness, but what hypnotizes and appalls are her eyes
Wide open, transformed by the chlorine into something ghostly, they are unforgettable
As the bleach gurgles down the drain, Stargher lifts Anne from the tub and carries her to the table
He places her face up and dries her with a clean white towel
He moves her limbs, lips, hips, and hands into desired positions then retreats into shadow
In the harsh light, against the shiny table, the bleached body has the quality of an apparition and we almost expect her to move
We  Stargher remove his clothes and he steps into the pool of light
Nude, we see that his lean, muscular frame is laced with some rough tatoos
When he turns his back to us, we find   , thick and strong,  through his flesh
Two columns of four on either side of the spine, running from shoulder blade to just below the waist
What in God's name are they for
Stargher shuts off the work light and moves to an area where he keeps   and VCRs
He inserts a videocassette taken from the surveillance deck and watches the screen
In   , we see Anne awaken in the cell
Her first moments inside
Disoriented, terrified, trapped, she examines her surroundings
Stargher is mesmerized by her fear
Fast-forwarding to her death, he presses a remote and we get

Aroused, stimulated, Stargher drinks it in like a symphony
Valentine cowers in the back of his cage, hating this

Admiring Anne's body, Stargher links the hooks to the rings in his back
He presses a remote unit and up in the rafters, a series of  click into motion
The sound is torturous as the mechanical hoist  Stargher off the ground, pulling at the rings, strips of flesh rising
Stargher grimaces, but clearly he wants the pain, needs it
As the hoist clicks into another gear, it carries Stargher over the table until his body is perfectly positioned above Anne's
In the flickering weird light of the television screen, Stargher resembles something from the twisted imagination of William Blake - a levitating demon ready to debauch an innocent angel
With his free hand, he touches himself, chains clinking and swaying

Not so much as a thermometer up his ass

Stockwell nods and follows the stretcher outside
stoic Ramsey enters from the living room and Novak can see the disappointment in his eyes
She's not here
Novak would give anything for that not to be true

"  It's all here, the table, the piercing supplies, the bleach
An odd, grisly collection of  fills cubby holes in a wooden storage/shelf unit
Novak's eyes are like a camera, documenting and storing as much information as possible, but it's overwhelming
He moves through the basement
Careful not to touch anything
He stops and focuses on the hoist and eight hooks situated over the stainless steel table

Ramsey switches on the video monitor and the screen fills with images of Anne dying in the cell
Novak is painfully, tragically drawn to this
Although he's seen his share of horrific things, Novak is truly disturbed by the sight of Anne, desperate to escape, drowning, slowly dying, and he knows: This is what will happen to Julia Hickson unless he finds her
- Caught by surprise, Julia blocks the spray with her hands and searches for a shut off valve
Of course, there is none
Thirty seconds later, the water stops
Like an animal caught in a trap, Julia's eyes dart around her "cage
"  What kind of hell is this
Shivering, she catches herself in the mirror and looks deeply into it
Something's odd about the glass
Is someone watching her
She bangs on it with her fist
Hey

Only her reflection

Novak, Ramsey and Teddy Lee stand by as the killer is examined by

He pulls away and checks the  already on a lightbox
Minimal activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
And here, the anterior cingulate cortex
(to Novak and Ramsey) It's what helps distinguish between external and internal stimuli
What the hell does that mean
(answering for Reid) He's schizophrenic
Novak doesn't like this
Not one bit
What're you doing here, Reid
Paving the way for his insanity defense
No need
There won't be a trial
This is no act
The coma is real
Whoa
Wait a minute
You ever hear of Whalen's Infraction
Clearly not
(') (re: the ) In any schizophrenic, these areas would be affected
But in someone with Whalen's, they're hit hard and hit fast
Novak's worry intensifies
(') Stargher's neurological system was infected by a virus in utero
It lay dormant
In his case for about
(guesses at Stargher's age) thirty years
Most likely, he's exhibited symptoms for awhile now, but the infraction - the breach - didn't occur 'til today
You never know when it'll happen, at what age, or why
The triggers vary, but the results don't
(fascinated by Stargher) He has no ties to reality
No awareness of this world or the people in it
What about Thorazine
Or
Desoxyn
The normal psychotropics don't work
He's not just catatonic, he's
disappeared
Like having a dream and never waking up
This girl
Julia Hickson
Only he knows where she is
Then 'm sorry
For her and for you
Novak is past angry
He's bordering on devastation
Ramsey attempts to placate him
We'll go back to his house, Pete
There's still a lot to do
Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records
Maybe he owns property somewhere
They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon
Four-oh
He got Julia at seven-thirty last night
You know what time it is now
Ramsey backs off, knowing his partner is on the verge of really losing it
Reid thinks perhaps he shouldn't, but sensitive to Novak's pain and anger, mentions it anyway - if only to keep his friend from true hopelessness

Catherine, Cooperman, Henry, and Miriam watch with curiosity, disgust, pity
Novak and Ramsey flank the portable monitor/, knowing this is a disturbing but powerful tool
There's someone else in the room
John Tracy
He cannot watch the video, not again
Catherine glances at him, uncomfortable with his presence
When did he lapse into the coma
Sometime yesterday morning
John tries to keep his composure, but Novak's making this tough for him
Novak wants the scientists to see, to understand the boy's pain
(') Each tape is the same
He provides food, drinking water, a toilet
Periodically, a shower starts
It's on some kind of timer - he's clever with machines, building things
think he wants them to believe this is a simple kidnapping
That there's a possibility of rescue
Of survival
But it's just a form of torture
At the end of the fortieth hour, the drain shuts
The water starts and doesn't stop
(gravely) We've already lost more than a day
If she isn't found tonight
She dies like the rest
(to Miriam, Henry and Catherine) John and Ella Baines - as well as the Sunerset Board of Directors - have given their approval, but the decision is yours
What about the legalities of this
Stargher is in custody
The functional equivalent of being under arrest
Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him
But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights
So what you're asking us to do is illegal
No, not at all
(explains) We're dealing with exigent circumstances
Somewhere there's a kidnapped woman still alive
If we weigh the suspect's Constitutional Rights against the public safety
The Law favors the victim and gives us a lot of leeway
It's called the Public Safety Exception
So what can you do
Pretty much anything we want
There's a chance to save a human life
Because of that, Stargher has no reasonable expectation of privacy
Miriam, Henry and Cooperman appear to be onboard
Novak's made a persuasive, heartfelt argument
Only one person still remains uncertain
What if
All eyes turn to her
(') What if he wasn't like this
What if he was "normal
"  Conscious
How far would you go
As far as  needed
Catherine nods, analyzes Novak's eyes, gestures, body language, and "interrogates" him
Do you think he'd tell you what you need to know
John's discomfort is increasing and Novak is sensitive to it
There's always a chance they'll confess
Really
don't work with violent cases,  work with children
But even a kid lies
They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true
Don't you think Stargher would do the same
Sometimes
Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure
They have so much they want to tell
But they've never had a sympathetic ear
They need someone to understand why
(focusing on Catherine) Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully
It was part of the ritual
Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean
But these last three
They were still in water - always in water - but (clarifies) Listen, he wasn't just careless
It went beyond that
Okay
Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing
Most likely, that part is dead
Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world
'm sorry,  really am
Is it possible
If he came to trust me, yes, but it takes months to build that kind of trust
Someone like Stargher can't distinguish between fantasy and reality
It's all the same
He might tell me she's in Timbuktu and absolutely, one hundred percent believe it to be true, but she's
(
) Julia
They turn to John Tracy
His vulnerable, barely audible voice forcing everyone to listen
(') Not "she

Not thing, or it, or her
Do you know anything about her

Once he's gone, Ramsey takes this moment "alone" to question his partner
You sure you want to go through with this
What else do we do
don't know, Pete, but for god's sake
This is nuts
Do you really understand what they're going to do
don't have to
Why jeopardize what we've already done

That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer

But if we push our luck
If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it
Tell you what
If this thing burns us, take that heat
give you permission to point your finger at me and say "It was all his idea
" (offended) That's not what 'm talking about, Pete
'm talking about waking up and realizing this girl's gonna die
The words are anathema to Novak
That won't happen
Cooperman appears in the doorway and informs them
They're ready
Ramsey looks to his partner, but Novak is already on Cooperman's heels
Resignedly, Ramsey follows
-  - Cooperman guides Novak and Ramsey into the lab
The  men are impressed, but neither is quite sure what to make it all
The  escort team leader gets Ramsey's signature and Novak undoes the cuffs from Stargher's wrists and ankles
Following Miriam's direction, the escorts guide the gurney carrying Stargher into the procedure room
As Cooperman shows them out, Henry seals shut the door
Miriam assumes responsibility for Stargher's care and checks his pulse, , pupil dilation, and vital signs
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him
They took care of that, thank you, Henry
(getting him out of her hair) (') Why don't you give our guests a little tour
Proud of his computer, but uncomfortable around strangers, Henry directs Novak and Ramsey to the console
Gentlemen, you stand before the one and only Neurological Cartography and Synaptic Transfer System
Although he's listening, Novak's eyes never really stray from his prisoner as Miriam uses safety scissors to cut away Stargher's clothes
(') It provides a highly detailed map of the human mind
Not the brain - any  can do that
The mind
(self-impressed) It reads and processes electronically allowing information to be transferred and interrupted
(for the laymen) Let's say your thoughts could be stored on
If someone had the right kind of player, they could watch and listen to what you're thinking
Novak observes Miriam as she "undresses" Stargher and Ramsey pokes around the lab
(') But we can't record or store the data
The connections between nerve cells are constantly being modified
Miriam needs a moment to fully take in the scars
Henry continues, eager to focus attention back to him, but even he is fascinated by Stargher's skin
(') It's like the early days of television
The subject sends out a live feed and you receive it during time of broadcast
Whatever happens, happens
All you have to do is "tune in
" Miriam gives Stargher an alcohol bath, the clinical procedure taking on the quality of ritual
Her wash cloth moves under Stargher's chin and over his face
She's careful around the eyes and finds herself unable to look at them for long
(') But you do more than tune in
You become part of the snow
Catherine enters from a dressing area wearing the bodysuit
Filled with curiosity, Novak watches Miriam and Catherine fit Stargher into his suit

This isn't some "troubled kid" you're dealing with

How hard could it be
Catherine and Miriam try to hide their laughter
The first

Six or seven times went in
Remember what happened
Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia
Like a New Year's Day hangover

Novak and Catherine roll Stargher onto his stomach
This man is deeply disturbed, he
You don't know the procedure

That may be true, but you don't have Catherine's gift

Miriam peels away a bandage and examines the flesh

Don't touch that, please
Sorry
Miriam prepares a series of   and loads them into a container connected to the -like tubes linked to the suspension device
(intimate, quiet) This isn't your responsibility
Remember that
Don't let them use guilt as a tool
If you want to stop, say so
'll be fine
She said convincingly
Catherine focuses on the procedure and makes the necessary connections
Reluctantly, Miriam retreats to the monitoring station
She "locks down" the procedure room and joins Henry, Novak, and Ramsey at the console
(eyes on the chemical/drug monitors) That's the stuff
About twelve years of research, right Miriam
Don't remind me
What is it - are they - exactly
That's like asking her to explain the rules of cricket
Psychostimulants, serotonin, stabilizers, meprobamate, Neurontin, lithium carbonate
And my baby
It duplicates and expands upon the effects of a chemical called oxytocin, forcing a break in the neuron connections that hold experience
So new experience can form
Ramsey is utterly lost and just sort of nods, but Novak is fascinated
Catherine presses the bump on her hand flashes on
There's a touch-sensitive microchip implanted in her hand
If she becomes frightened, disoriented, or simply wants to end the session, she signals us to abort
Catherine presses again and the red light shuts off
Although none of what she experiences is real, she can be tricked into thinking it is
The mind is awfully gullible, so she needs to monitor herself

Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy
(clarifies) When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as "receivers

Nothing more
But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening
She understood
And the patient responded
Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things
He knew she cared
hopeful, solemn Novak gazes through the window, watching Catherine's body as it becomes parallel to Stargher's

Microscopic veins in the eyelid become wires connected to chips
And we're , into the circuitry
' The pattern of the electronics grows into something more organic, textured, concrete
Evolving into a world
Black and shadow-filled, it resembles a labyrinthine complex of vertical walls with cubicle like rooms carved deep into its core
Our journey into this bleak, grim place continues and we occasionally glimpse brief images of a boy's baptism
with this journey are sections of cloudy blackness and fragmented visions of  connected to the apparatus, face masked,  into this world
There is an abrupt  from still images to regular motion and we find ourselves gliding over a tidepool filled with tiny fish and tadpoles
At water's edge, lying on rough, pebble-strewn ground, is a

From the darkness comes a
Black in color and featureless, it sniffs Catherine, dismisses her, and meanders into a cubicle opposite her, disappearing from view

The "floor" is covered with filth, ash, pebbles, and insects
Water is present in many forms, puddles, moisture, dripping ceilings

Hello
The frightened child retreats into a corner of the claustrophobic room, but the horse does not startle
Surprisingly - to the boy - the horse takes an affectionate step toward Catherine, inviting her to take over
Catherine allows the mare to smell her, then vigorously scratches along the mane and shoulder, much to the horse's delight
(') Yeah, you like that, don't you
She can see the boy hiding in the corner, stealing glances at her from the shadows

Tired and having difficulty breathing, she drops to her knees and "cools down

Curious yet cautious, she examines the nearby walls, floor, and ceiling for any signs of "traps" akin to the glass blades
Finding none, she pulls the mechanism and quickly steps back
The shutter opens and Catherine knows there's something alive in the tiny cubicle beyond
She retreats into shadow, hiding
Released from the chamber is a

Ghostly pale and adorned in eerie fetish garb, she appears to "sense" the presence of a stranger, targets Catherine in the shadows, and
Catherine's had enough and moves to press the implant, She brutally grabs Catherine,  her against the wall and her head against it
Catherine drops to the floor like a rag doll
Victim One hefts Catherine onto her shoulder and with great purpose, carries her deep into the labyrinth, toward the core
Passing in and out of consciousness, between darkness and light, a dazed Catherine is taken on a "tour" of Stargher's world
Passing mausoleum-like chambers filled with  of unspeakable horror and/or disturbing intensity
At one of the rooms, we think we see Young Stargher silently observing
Sitting of standing in individual cubicles are ' ( thru ), each woman resembling the grotesque porcelain dolls glimpsed in the cubbyholes in Stargher's basement

As Ramsey joins them, Novak nods, understanding, but his eyes are on Catherine, who's just coming back to consciousness
(') (re: orange section) However, if her level of involvement is rather intense, as it was just now, she can perceive things as true
It's difficult to keep perspective
As Novak lingers on that question, Ramsey gestures at the red section
What happens here
We don't talk about that
What happens
Well, Theoretically, while she's inside
If she came to believe that Stargher's world is her world, her mind has the power to convince the body that anything done to it is, um, actually done
Novak doesn't like the sound of that

We don't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation

She appreciates his understanding
And finds herself comforted by his presence
Catherine scrutinizes Novak, his intensity, his honesty, his complexity
And asks: Agent Novak
Peter, okay
Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people
The question catches Novak off-guard, but he's willing to answer
Anything to get her talking
Absolutely
(realizing it's too personal) suppose everyone does
Just like we all have fantasies, right
Things only we know, that we don't share
That's what therapists are for, right
Catherine laughs
It helps her relax

don't think she matters anymore
Not to him
He never finished her
The others
he was able to make them his
You think you can do this, don't you
He might tell me about Julia
The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse
Who wants to be redeemed
(skeptically) This is Stargher we're talking about
Not Stargher, not really
He's split himself right down the middle
Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel
monster
And an innocent child
If could reach the boy
Whoa
Hold on
Aren't they the same guy
Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality
Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act
We're all human
It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like "remorse
" Then what is he
Evil
If you believe that
Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time
(sensing something) What happened to Charles Gish
Novak doesn't respond
She prods him
(') What happened
What difference does it make
Tell me
God, he does not want to do this
Right after the trial, the night after he was released
Mr
and Mrs
Frank Simmons found Charlie sitting in their living room watching  with their twelve-year old daughter Margaret
He'd cut her right down the middle with a carving knife
(') Found the girl's heart in the freezer - he thought they might want to keep it
(grim humor) Luckily, the next thing he did was slit his own throat
(bleakly) am convinced of one thing
Charles Gish could've been raised by Ozzie and Harriet and the same thing would've happened
He can see Catherine doesn't accept that
(') child can experience abuse worse than Charlie's
And grow up to be someone who would never, ever hurt another living thing
You're sure of that
Yes
am
Catherine realizes that was a confession
(
) Where the hell you been
They turn to see Ramsey
Right here
Next time, tell me, okay
But you looked so cute
All sleepy
Ramsey shoots him a murderous look, then asks Catherine
Your colleagues want to know what to do with Stargher
Novak looks to Catherine for the answer
Through the window blinds, she watches John Tracy lower his head
Tell them to prep him
And that 'll be right there
Ramsey nods and heads back to the lab
Thank you
Briefly, he touches her hand
Catherine looks away from John to Novak's hand, to the photographs on the wall

" Slowly, confidently, she approaches the Shepherd, kneels, and removes his leash and muzzle
She strokes him and the dog instantly warms up to her
-9 Sure wasn't like that with me
Novak signs a document and the -9 Agent exits
You're a good boy, aren't you, Valentine
The dog picks up a scent from the procedure room and moves it, Catherine and Novak following

Now taped to the wall near Stargher are  from the basement - his dolls, the hoist, etc
Miriam (in surgical mask and gloves) carefully re-inserts the   (taken from an   ) into the eight straps of flesh on his back
When he sees this, Valentine whimpers and hides
Catherine comforts him
Miriam finishes her task and removes her mask
hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this
think that's the whole point
Valentine runs to his "sleeping" master and barks at Catherine as if asking for help
She encourages the animal to lick and sniff Stargher's face and hands
(
) (') That's interesting
, he scrutinizes the monitor showing the detailed "map" of Stargher's brain
(') Increased neural activity in the frontal lobes
Rising dopamine levels in the basal ganglia
Ever since the dog walked in
, Catherine readies herself in the "receive" apparatus
As Stargher is lifted off the pedestal, the doors  shut and Valentine curls up on the floor beneath his master
As Catherine is lifted, she smiles at the animal, then looks to Stargher
(comforting and coaching her) Remember, Julia Hickson is priority number one
Nothing else matters
Find out where she is
Okay, okay
Catherine's eyes shut
(
) Uh-oh
We hear an   rise and fall
Catherine opens her eyes and the  blink on and off in a weird pattern, making it difficult to see clearly
Don't kid around, Henry
Her suspension apparatus  on the floor

) 'm not
It's a power problem
need you to go to the circuit breaker and check switches six through twelve
Catherine moves toward the electrical panel
(
) (') Try to stay awake, okay
Yeah, yeah, yeah
'm not sleepy
As she moves toward the panel, everything becomes larger
By the time Catherine reaches the circuit breaker, it is the size of a garage door
Curiouser and curiouser
She turns around to see the    and And she sees herself - Catherine as small as a mouse trapped in a giant walled space

Motionless

The electronic  becomes , , staying calm, she searches for and finds a   on the floor
She pushes out
The camera executes a complete 180-degree perspective change
Catherine plummets
She tries to reach out, to stop her descent, but cannot
Catherine falls through a dark   resembling a mammoth hollowed-out rib cage
Below her is a - "growing" out of the floor, a  in the center of its crest
Dozens of other such domes are visible in the murky hell-hole, but Catherine has no choice
She's dropping into this one
Once she passes through the hole,   , Catherine's body looks as though it's moving through water, but there is no water
Like an aerial artist, she reverses her position so she's "heads up
"  Standing, stable, on the floor
Sensing something with her
And knows it is
Valentine
Out from the darkness, moving in normal motion, comes the white German Shepherd, but in the thick haze, his face is indistinct and ghostly

As Catherine enters the claustrophobic house, the boy hesitantly pushes a towel toward her, but doesn't look
She reaches the counter and starts to dry, much to Young Stargher's relief
As he washes, Catherine hands him a just like Edward's

He's hypnotized by the thing, his eyes lighting up

Startlingly, his father, Martin Stargher, is already in the room
Cruel, imposing, manipulative man

Liars will be punished

But the scream comes from behind and she spins around

On a nearby table are whisky, tumblers, and an ashtray filled with butts

She gives him a
Drunk, she hugs and kisses him
Embarrassed, the boy tries to squirm away
(') Oh no
You're not going anywhere
Martin enters and sneers at the boy
Go back to bed, worm
It's okay, we was just
Shut up, cunt
The woman cowers, familiar with his violent moods
The boy hurries to his room, but Martin grabs him by the collar
(') What is that
He pulls the doll from the child's hands, turns to the woman, and  her across the face with it, gashing her cheek
(') You give him nothing
Whore
Are you his mother
Terrified, she shakes her head "no
"  Martin sees Young Stargher quietly crawling away, hoping to escape
Martin lifts the boy off the floor with one hand and holds him in front of the woman
(') You see that
You slithered out one of them
But where is she now, Carl
As far from you as she could get, that's where
(shoves him at the woman) You want a mommy
Is that what you want
The poor boy trembles with fear
And Martin notices a puddle of urine on the floor
He drops the boy and laughs
(') Little worm pissed his pants
Humiliated, Carl covers himself and hides in a corner
Martin and the woman   , delighting in the boy's humiliation
Feeling the boy's shame, Catherine turns and finds a taped to the wall
'  - Martin has discovered his son's secret hiding place - a camouflaged corner of the attic
Arranged in deliberate, artistic fashion are scavenged
Heads, limbs and torsos held together with twine, tape and wire
Some wrapped in filthy plastic
Faded photographs (including one of his ), mementos, and most disturbingly, the feathers and bones of dead birds, insect carcasses, and dissected, desiccated mice
There's something peculiarly beautiful here, but Martin doesn't see it
Not at all
Only girls play with dolls
He turns and we see Carl is bound to a wooden support beam, a piece of tape covering his mouth
The boy is stripped to the waste, barely conscious, face streaked with tears and sweat
(') What kind of thing are you
snaps Catherine back to "reality
"  She turns just as a door opens behind her
Responding to the "invitation," she moves through it
'  - The adult Carl Stargher sits at the edge of the tub, his back to us, smoking a cigarette
white German Shepherd clicks across the tile floor and  at Catherine
She again hears the
wobbles as Stargher's bloody rubber-gloved hands fill it with something
Stargher knows she's there and isn't surprised by her presence, but he's not sure what to make of her
What to do with her
He rises and walks past her to the sink
He pulls off the gloves and washes his hands, glancing at her in the mirror
Catherine cannot resist looking in the tub
She sees a dead girl, her torso sliced open
Disgusted and mortified, she pulls back
(
) She was the first
She turns, and Stargher is no longer at the sink
(
) (') Didn't know what  was doing
She turns, where's this voice coming from
She steps back

) (') Be careful

Wobble-wobble wobble
The bowl makes its now-familiar noise

) (') What did you do now
You make a mess
And she can see him coming out of the shadows
Catherine backs into a corner, fearing what will come
(') hate a mess
Stargher steps into a pool of light, shooshes the puppy into the hall, shuts the bathroom door, and looks right at Catherine
(') Why are you here
God almighty, what does she say
What does she tell him
(') Don't lie, now
--
The puppy scratches at the door and whimpers, but Stargher's not about to let him back in
Moving slowly, carefully, he approaches Catherine
(') Liars will be punished
Catherine makes a break for the door
"Playfully," Stargher makes a half-hearted attempt to block her, but she evades him and reaches for the knob
But the door's not there -
She can still hear the dog, but there's no damn door
She turns: No door
No window
The girl's body and bloody remains have vanished
An   flickers on, giving the room the look and feel of the cell
(
) (') Where do you think you're going
Catherine turns, back to the wall, calm and intimidating, Stargher stands in the center regarding her with great curiosity
Catherine's ready to press the sensor
(') Don't do that
She hesitates
(') If you go away, you'll never find her
How did he know
(') If you never find her, she dies
Like the rest
Catherine stops and listens
She can't leave now
The path to Julia has appeared

Why you came to my happy little home
He reaches for her and she flinches
Expecting such behavior, Stargher grins
(') You're pretty
pretty, pretty thing
Catherine cannot show her fear, not now
She composes herself and approaches him

His grin broadens to a smile and he almost laughs
Help me
That's good
That's a good one
(malevolent) Liar
Whore
Cunt
Catherine stands her ground
You sound like your father
He gets close to her face and sneers
am not like him
Stargher retreats into the shadows, but Catherine persists
Then help me
Where is Julia Hickson
Why
Maybe, because you want to
Is that right
You think you know me

Miriam

) You wanna know who  am

Catherine moves to touch the sensor in her hand
He , and  her onto the floor, the back of her head Her vision blurs
Ears are ringing

Stargher King straddles Catherine and pins her arms behind her back
She's unable to touch the sensor

He shoves the tool through her neck and presses the trigger

As it becomes "cool," Stargher's becomes "hot

Startling everyone
The dog  and backs away
As if he senses something horribly wrong within his master
, Novak questions the scientists
When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out
That was with Edward
She's accustomed to his world
Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory
She's "lost
" (looks at the third suit) Someone has to go in
Remind her what's really happening
And get her out
Until then, she's at his mercy
Mercy
Novak's mind reels
Into Stargher
Inside
Yes
Novak knows who that person will be
- Fueling herself with candy and juice, Julia examines the cell for a way out, but finds tight seals everywhere She counts until thirty, it stops
Shivering, Julia stars at the drain as the water spirals down

The first five minutes will be disorienting
Give yourself time

If you can see, smell, feel, hear, taste things - you're on the right track
Once you've acclimated, try to get a feeling for Catherine
Instinct plays a huge role in this
Trust it

Novak does and the red light comes on
As Novak is , he looks at Catherine, then Stargher
Valentine  and settles beneath Novak
The suspension device clicks into place and the  descends
(
) No matter what happens, Peter, remember one thing: It's not real
Novak's eyes fix on the clear liquid contained in the -like cylinder
liquid cloud of his blood grows within
Preparing the mixture for injection
The viscosity of the fluid starts to thicken and the As blood and chemical swirls take shape, we
Deeper into the fluid at a molecular level
We feel like we're  over some kind of liquid landscape
He's having difficulty making the 98 transition
Flying faster, faster, faster
Through an entire universe
Novak is in the procedure room
Alone
His face contorted as if feeling the effects of tremendous -
' hover above a dark, gloomy landscape dotted with hills
sit on black earth, their bodies positioned in a uniform pattern at their feet, in a kneeling fetal position, face down in the gritty soil, a piece of cloth draped over his head
With difficulty, practically inhaling black grit, Novak breathes deeply and rises to his knees
His hand moves to his face and he's briefly astounded by the texture of the gravel, the sharpness of it against his face
Removing the shroud-like cloth, he looks at the soil, smells it, tastes it
(
) Have you seen him
Novak finds the first of the three -   ' - addressing him
She, like the other two, speaks in a ghostly monotone, nearly devoid of emotion
(') My boy, my little one
His father took him from me
Have you seen him
As she continues, almost mantra-like,   : (similar monotone) My child is an abomination
He is damned
He has no soul
The women's repetitive "monologues" overlap
Aurual layers now added by
Me god me boy
Me god good son
Novak takes a moment to absorb his surroundings
The sights, sounds and feel of the place
Like being within a dream
As he backs away from the odd quartet,   dances across his face
Shading his eyes
Novak searches for the source
Opposite him, across the valley, is a massive cliff face pockmarked with rough "windows
"  Like a star, the  sparkles inside one of them, a fragment of reflecting a beam away from Novak's face to a cutting across the valley floor to the base of the wall
The light guiding him, Novak follows the path and starts to , finding stairs or ladders, passing deep, seemingly infinite passages
Like tombs, or the "drawers" of a mausoleum
Deep within one of them,
Fades
And Novak crawls into darkness
'  - Novak emerges in a cavernous room dripping with decadence
The place reeks of sex, pain, lust, and cruelty
As he moves deeper into the chamber, Novak sees   perched atop some kind of pedestal, crouching, fingering his mirror , bouncing sparkles of light into the dark corners of the room The   pinpoints a  emerging from the darkness
It is Catherine
Altered to an image of Stargher's victims
Her skin, face, clothing, eyes, are just like the Victims'
It's a shocking, strange image, made even more disturbing by the look of pleasure on her face
Novak is staggered by the sight
His vision and hearing become affected by blurred vision, sharp sounds - then focus to clarity as he reminds himself
Not real
Like an ethereal queen of the damned, she strides toward him, narrowing her eyes
(') Catherine
She exhibits no recognition of her name
Catherine seductively moves closer to Novak, their bodies almost touching, her hands caressing his hair, lips, neck
(') Jesus
Catherine
Listen to me
She presses her finger to his lips and forces him down, onto the floor, his back to the pedestal
Catherine straddles Novak, and when he tries to stand, she holds him down, forcing him to stay
(') She steals a glance over his shoulder and glimpses a coming toward them, coming into the light
Novak is utterly unaware of what's happening
Catherine is keeping him occupied
Waiting for the arrival of
Catherine
Novak catches only a fleeting glimpse of the monster before Stargher King  him by the throat and his head against a pedestal
'  - Eyelids rise and flutter
Novak becomes conscious
And instantly realizes what's happened
He lies on the pedestal, face up, spread-eagle, his wrists and ankles bound to the cold stone surface with leathery cords
Standing over him, in a pool of light, is Stargher King
Wearing what could be seen as  , a silent, solemn Stargher King prepares himself for execution of a ritual by polishing and arranging an assortment of shiny, sharp, macabre
Novak shuts his eyes and silently tells himself, Not real
He opens them, breathes deeply and focuses on Catherine
You're Catherine Young
You majored in Psych at  San Diego
You work for Sunerset Industries
Stargher King's fingers pass over an array of horrific instruments - the throat piercer/collar mechanism, a cleaver knife, a misshapen hammer, a long slender needle
(') Your grandmother raised you after your parents died in a car crash
Stargher King lifts the blade-like
So far, Catherine looks at Novak like he's speaking gibberish
(') When you were twenty-one, you were arrested for possession and got off with community service
Stargher King  through Novak's clothes, exposing the flesh of his abdomen
(') (reminding himself) Not real, Pete
This is not real
(urgency) You had to work at a center for abused kids for three months
You stayed on two years for no pay
You give half your fucking salary to the nursing home your grandmother stays at

Novak struggles and pleads with Catherine

The intensity of Novak's cries hit Catherine like a thunderbolt
There's a glimmer of life, of recognition in her eyes

(mimicking Novak, laughing) Nod reel, nod reel, nod reel
As Stargher King stumbles away gagging, blood pouring form his neck, we see that she has returned to normal
The "bride" persona is gone
As Stargher King emits animalistic growls, Catherine turns and sees an intact Novak standing next to her
As if nothing had happened
Catherine and Novak  out of the den, into the tunnel from which Novak gained access
He stops, ready to press the sensor, when a    dances across Catherine's face
Wait
Like hell "wait

Trust him

She knows what he'll do
Catherine and Novak crawl through the dark, grimy claustrophobic space, playing with his mirror locket
Carl
He so desperately wants her affection, but fear prevents him from reaching out to her

Scared, he shakes his head "no

You're my friend and would never hurt you
She extends her hand
Oh-so-hesitantly he takes it
(') Will you take us to her
To Julia
Shyly, hesitantly, he nods
She smiles gratefully and affectionately touches the boy's face
Clasping her hand, Young Stargher leads Catherine and Novak into utter darkness

Like on a map
He shakes his head and buries his face in her shoulder

You helped so much already

As a frustrated Novak searches for anything identifying, Catherine comforts the boy and looks deeply into his sad, haunted eyes

The boy leans against her and she caresses his face

Novak finds himself standing in front of the idealized cell
Mounted beneath the glass is a shiny, perfect metal plaque reading   , with a logo
Novak recognizes it from the hoist in Stargher's basement
Let's go
He pulls her to her feet
Feeling betrayed and rejected, the child breaks away from her
shakes the cell
Terrified, the boy searches for a place to hide
Novak feels what's coming
can't leave him
His throat wounded, bloody mess, he descends out of dark nothingness,  with rage
He reaches for Catherine, but Young Stargher runs in front of her
Little Carl opens his mouth in a silent scream
Catherine's arms reach out to him, but Novak clasps her hand and presses
And she is haunted by the sight of a frightened child in the arms of a monster

They're back

He and Miriam frantically cease the procedure
Novak and Catherine are lowered and Novak startles them by quickly regaining consciousness
Miriam attempts to inject him with stabilizing drugs, but he's already trying to tear himself out of the apparatus

Dizziness and disorientation again hit Novak
Pale and sweating, he winces as his stomach agonizingly cramps
Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell
Considering where 've been
Fighting the pain, he gathers together , slips on his shoes and grabs gun and holster
Ramsey is apoplectic
Whoa-whoa-whoa
Mind telling me what the fuck is happening
Novak points to the photo of Stargher's basement, specifically the hoist

Catherine encourages her
Go

Go
As Miriam hurries to catch Novak, she tells Henry
Keep an eye on her
He nods, but isn't really paying attention
Catherine turns to Stargher's motionless form, still suspended, still connected to the machinery
- Do something, Julia
She looks around the room and runs her hands along the walls, the tile, looking for a weak spot
She focuses on the and although it's painful because of swollen fingers, removes her

Novak races out of the Center, Ramsey right behind him,  at each other in order to hear above the chopper noise
Pete, listen to me
What did you really learn in there
Anything new
You really think Stargher gave you a save the-day clue
What if this is all some kind of trick your head is playing on you
He won't consider that
Novak climbs into the helicopter and buckles himself in
He looks to Ramsey - you coming

- Henry analyzes voluminous print-outs from the last procedure
Although his eyes are on the data, he converses with Catherine in the   via intercom

We see chemicals flow and computer programs initiate the procedure, but Henry is oblivious

Never saw that before
Hey, remember that one time

It's a small change, but it makes all the difference in the world
- Like a rock climber in a crevasse, Julia shimmies up the walls of the cell by bracing herself in a corner and using her hands and feet to push up
The tile is slippery and each movement precarious
She uses strength and balance to reach a position just below the Plexiglass, the fluorescent light bathing her in an eerie intense glow
She sees a gap between the glass and the wall and uses her   to dig into it, , , with the diamond
Julia nearly loses her balance, but manages to stay pressed into the corner
She kicks the shower head, sending the spray as far from her as possible, and continues to dig at the caulking around the light fixture
, we see something unexpected
The clock reads 00:00:00
That water isn't going to stop
- ' Miriam and Ramsey return to the lab to find Henry anxiously observing from the console
(flustered) She changed the codes
What's wrong
It would take hours to re-route the system, and even if  did,  shouldn't
What are you talking about
Miriam analyzes the situation and regretfully, angrily, worriedly realizes what's happened
She's done it
Stupid, stupid girl
Done what
Instead of going into his mind
She's bringing Stargher into hers
' bright, deliriously colorful realm visually reflective of things we saw in Catherine's home
Unusual trees, rock formations, totems, statues, and a brilliant
The pond ripples
Visible through the crystal-clear water is , rising to the surface like a drowning victim suddenly breaking through to air
Panicked, he scrambles to shore and pulls himself to land
Although the place is comforting and beautiful, he's in strange territory and it frightens him
Shivering, he hunches down, eyes darting this way and that
(
) You're all right, Carl
The boy turns toward the voice and finds , her hair waving in the wind, skin glowing, eyes bright, cutting a magnificent figure in clothes that make her a warrior goddess
She opens her arms and the boy runs to her, basking in the comfort of her embrace
He shivers and she holds him tightly
(') It's okay, honey, you're with me now
You're safe here
She looks deeply into his eyes and reassuringly explains
(') promised  would help you, and always keep my promises
Can
Catherine is astonished and relieve to hear him speak sad, trembling little voice
(') Can  stay here
She is touched that he would ask and strokes his face
(regretfully) Oh
no, honey, 'm sorry
It's doesn't work that way
The boy breaks away from her, turning his back
She gently takes his hand but he yanks it free
(') But what if  told you you could come visit
He slowly turns to her
(') 'll make sure it happens, Carl
'll get them to let me do it
And maybe
maybe we can
Young Stargher's eyes open wide with silent terror
Over his shoulder, she sees a  slither through the pool
over her legs and hair
She stands and brushes them off
The atmosphere grows darker and ominous
He found me
Catherine bristles as       like a human serpent
The brilliant colors of Catherine's world fade to
(') He always finds me
Stargher King  with anger and confusion
Where thiisss att
Me god no like id here
He snarls when he sees Catherine
(') You
Priddy bish-hor-kund
You big trubble-mekker
(sneers at the boy) And you
You cumm home now, liddle cogsugger worm
Or me god haffa punish you
Young Stargher tightens his embrace of Catherine
She steps back, away from the pond, hugging the boy tightly
No
No
Stargher King laughs
(') Hoo you thing you are
Himm Muther
He comes close and reaches for the boy
(') You gimme liddle worm
For a moment, Catherine appears frightened and intimidated
Perhaps near an emotional breakdown
But that is not the case
She quietly lowers little Carl to the ground and whispers something in his ear
As the boy nods, runs and hides, a ferocity grows within her
said no
Like a vengeful Valkyrie, she emits what can only be called a Arms reaching for her
Catherine , ,
Stargher King doubles over
Catherine grabs his ears and pulls his face into her bent , breaking his nose
(') Welcome to my world
As blood flows from his nostrils, Stargher King grins
You funny
You thing you stop me god
At the right moment, Catherine sidesteps and him in the ribs as he passes
Stargher King crumples to the ground and she  an uppercut to this chin
Rising from the mud and muck, Stargher King lands a   to her head, sending her flying
He lifts the stunned Catherine with one hand and pulls her face to his
(') You cum back wif me god
You be good bish-hor-kund
Catherine looks into his soulless eyes
Then  in them and  his face
She breaks free as he  with pain
He steps toward her, but his feet don't move
The earth itself appears to wrap around them and turn hard, like concrete
Stargher King  with frustration
My world
seems to enrage from within her forearm, out the flesh and into her hand
(') My rules
She  across his chest, drawing blood
(
) No
Catherine stops
And turns to see the distraught Young Stargher
(') Don't hurt him
She spins around and sees not Stargher King, but
(') He didn't mean it
was bad
Disturbed by the transformation, Catherine backs away
Her vision blurs, the sound distorts
And the earth cracks around Stargher King's ankles
(') He teached me a lesson
deserved it
Fighting feelings of disorientation, she kneels before the child and rests the knife on the ground
No one deserves it, Carl
No one
She reaches out to him, but the child is  into the air by Stargher King
In one hand, the monster holds little Carl
In the other - a
His face and chest red with crimson, Stargher King fixes his eyes on Catherine with a predator's stare
Yer world
My knife
Stargher King raises the blade toward the boy's throat and - The strong arms of an adult Stargher breaks his arm at the elbow
Both the knife and boy are dropped to the ground as Stargher King  like a stuck pig, the good arm cradling the other
(') Me god hurt
Why you do that
Why
Enough
Stargher King regards him with disgust
Enuff
'  comes from the belly of the beast
'll tell you what's enough
Stargher and Stargher King square off
The boy stands between them with the knife at his feet
Carl
(still speaking as Martin) Shut up cunt
(to the boy) Give it here, worm
the child picks up the blade and stands between them, looking to Catherine for guidance
(') (as Martin) You want a mommy
Is that what you want
In an almost dream-like motion, the child hands the blade to adult Stargher
Enough
And he  the thing into Stargher King's heart
For a brief moment, Martin's face is superimposed over Stargher King's
Stunned, he slumps and regards adult Stargher with sad, troubled eyes
(as Stargher King) Why
What'd  do
Stargher  the handle of the blade and Martin/Stargher King drops dead
Dead
Young Stargher smiles and hugs Catherine
Time to go 'way
Carl
The boy runs to adult Stargher who lifts the child into his arms and holds him close
Bye
She looks to adult Stargher and begins to understand
He descends into the pool, the boy resting his head on his shoulder
Thank you, Catherine
You did help me
More than you'll ever know
Man and boy disappear beneath the water's surface
Catherine stands and sees that Stargher King's body has vanished
She walks to the shore and sees, deep underwater, Stargher and little Carl floating lifelessly like women in the cell
And
Goodbye Carl
She presses the sensor in her hand
- , Miriam is shocked by what she sees on the monitors and looks at Stargher
He's in full arrest
Catherine quietly returns to consciousness and is automatically lowered
She pulls the mask from her face, rises and opens the door
Miriam races inside and desperately attempts to revive Stargher
But it's no use
Angry and stunned, she demands of Catherine
(') Help me
But Catherine chooses not to
She knows Carl Stargher will never return to the world of the living
- The chopper roars across the sky
As they head northeast, away from the urban and toward the rural, Novak gazes out the window, trying to stay focused, fighting any after-effects of the drugs
The pilot communicates via headset
Agent Novak
Go ahead
Cole
'  - Cole and a handful of other agents pour into waiting Suburbans
(    )
The hoist was manufactured by Carver Industrial Equipment in 1982
Serial number 117-337J
Purchased by a boat shop in Lake Havasu, but sold to Lattimer's industrial Supply in 1992
- The water is near the ceiling
Kicking her legs to keep afloat, Julia  with the ring and we see she has created a gap between the light fixture housing and an unused leading to the surface
She pushes, but can't get anything to move
The opening will get no bigger
Julia sucks the last bit of oxygen and swims to the bottom of the cell
Searching for something, she finds a juice box and pulls out the drinking straw
- Shaken, but oddly transcendent, Catherine watches as Stargher's body is wheeled out of the lab on a gurney
She comforts a whimpering Valentine and tells him
Everything's alright now, Valentine promise
Novak scans the topography of  below, listening to a new report
- Cole is the passenger, on the radio to Novak,   next to him, doing about a hundred down the Interstate, blaring
Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano
Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it's just sitting there
Delano
Yep
And guess who they hired to seal up the place
You're kidding me
never kid
My wife hates it
Says 'm too serious
Novak locates Delano on the map
The exact location, Cole
Give it to me
The pilot grins and pushes the copper to top speed
- Julia is entirely underwater but alive
She uses the straw to suck oxygen through the gap in the ceiling, but it's difficult to tread water and her lungs are aching
Novak uses binoculars to scan farmland
He searches
And there it is: The abandoned farmhouse
- Julia tries to hold herself up by pressing her arms and legs against the walls, but as she does, the straw slips from her mouth
She reaches for it, but only succeeds in pushing it away from her
It heads for the drain
And disappears
The helicopter lands and Novak jumps out
He knows this is the place
He runs into the barn, but there's nothing, no sign of her
The pilot looks at him with a true sense of loss
- As Julia desperately tires to find the straw through the tiny holes of the drain, we see for the first time an expression which tells us she's given up
--
The cell starts to vibrate
repetitive noise -- - comes from above
She swims to the top of the cell and  at the ceiling
Fighting exhaustion and the side effects of the drugs, Novak pushes on
Think, Peter, think
His eyes find the and he  at the helicopter
Cut the engine
As the motor dies, Novak listens and listens
There it is
Water pipes beneath his feet
And very faintly, a pounding
He follows the sound, searching the earth
It's clearer now, louder
Novak tosses aside rusted junk and the pilot runs to assist him
Together, they expose the entrance to the underground sanctuary
- Novak drops to the floor below
Instantly affected by the similarities and the differences to the idealized cell of Stargher's mind, he feels another wave of dizziness, but pushes on
And is hit hard by the sight of  , her motionless body floating past him
and bubbles drift from her nose and mouth
Novak  on the Plexiglas and calls to her
The thick Plexiglass still remains, but she now can see him
Novak pulls his   and smacks it against the glass
(') He pulls his gun and takes aim
Julia swims to the top of the cell and presses herself against the ceiling
- ---
Novak fires a circle of shots into the thick plastic
Water slowly leaks, but the damn thing is still solid
He lifts the industrial  and  it at the bullet-damaged section Julia's body descends on the torrent of water
Novak reaches inside and pulls her to safety
He's just about to give her  when she coughs, sputters, and thirstily drinks in oxygen
Holding her tightly, Novak sinks to the floor, the water from the cell spilling everywhere
Cole's Suburban leads a contingent of  vehicles and local police cars onto the property, sirens blaring
- Hearing the sirens, Novak relaxes
For the first time in god knows how long, he relaxes
And holds Julia Hickson as if his life depended on it
: '  - Two cars parked outside
An old, quirky Volvo and a Land Rover
'  - As a television plays    , we find Catherine watching the movie from the couch, sitting up, drinking a cup of tea
She looks rested and quite cute in gym shorts and a -shirt, her  sleeping next to her
, Miriam packs up her stethoscope and blood pressure monitor, moves into the living room as Dorothy falls asleep in a field of poppies
left the nutritional information on the fridge door
Read it
Catherine nods, but she's more interested in the movie
Miriam deposits prescription bottles onto a side table
(') refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan
don't need them anymore
know
But she leaves them just the same
(') 'll come by tomorrow after work
With dinner
Thanks Miriam
Say hi to Henry and
give a kiss to Edward
(overlapping) Give a kiss to Edward
The women exchange smiles and Miriam exits
' As Miriam walks to her Land Rover, she sees a government issue Suburban park on the street and Peter Novak exit
Agent Novak
Dr
Kent
You're looking well
Thanks you
Six weeks off does a body good
(conspiratorially) heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward
That's a secret
Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am
We know all, see all
Novak opens the rear compartment of the Suburban and we hear something moving inside
(') How's the patient
Awaiting his arrival
What about the cat
Completely unaware
Miriam's pager  and she hurries to her car
(') 've got to go
Good luck
Novak smiles, waves goodbye, and reaches into the Suburban
' As Dorothy and her companions confront the Wizard, there's a at the screen door and Catherine sees Novak waiting
Ready
Catherine cradles her cat
Ready
He opens the door and escorts a leashed  into the living room
Catherine's cat squirms from her arms and hides under the couch
That went well
Give her a minute
(smiles at the dog) Hello, Valentine
Novak unleashes the albino Shepherd and he runs to Catherine, licking her face, wagging his tail
You sure about this
Absolutely
(calling for the cat) Abigail
Valentine picks up the cat's scent and sniffs around the base of the sofa
(') heard Julia and John got married
Yep
Eloped
Good for them
Valentine settles on the floor
Slowly, Abigail's curiosity gets the best of her and she creeps out, sniffing the dog's nose
Patient and sweet, Valentine lies still, allowing the cat to reach an acceptable level of comfort
Well look at that
told you
You have to be optimistic
Believe in them
So you say
Amazingly, Abigail brushes up against the dog and purrs
He's mine
All yours
My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had
Catherine laughs
She likes that
(') He also says that until proven differently, Julia Hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work
It doesn't matter
don't know
think it does
(genuine concern) You know, Catherine
If you ever want to talk about it
What happened to Stargher
That last time
It's painfully clear the thought of it still troubles her
Not just yet
Okay
Novak doesn't push it
He just takes her hand and gives it a gentle squeeze
The cat dashes into the kitchen and Valentine follows
(') They're hungry
got it
He moves into the kitchen
In a moment of quiet introspection, Catherine looks at the television screen, at Dorothy accidentally hitting the wicked Witch with a bucket of water, causing her to melt
And she looks away, unable to watch, disturbed by the image
She turns to the kitchen and sees Novak feeding an appreciative dog and cat
He rises and returns to the living room
Thank you
No problem
No
Thank you
He smiles and nods, gently resting his hand on her shoulder
Catherine shuts her eyes and leans toward him, comforted by simple human touch
