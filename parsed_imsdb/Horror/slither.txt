We   to   , a stunningly beautiful Southern woman in her twenties, as she finishes writing out, "   " Starla glances at the classroom of high school students
She is a demure woman, somewhat awkward in her speaking, but she has the rapt attention of all the boys in the class
When Darwin said 'fittest,' he didn't necessarily mean the strongest or the most intelligent, or any one trait -- he merely meant those organisms most well-suited to their environment
The boys in the class look her up and down as she speaks

She hits him

We humans think we're more fit, more evolved, because we're smarter
But we're neophytes

- Celebratory banners are strung over this street, including one that reads: "
" We're in the center of Wheelsy, South Carolina, a moderately depressed small town
Today's a big day, as  from far and near crowd the streets in their massive pickups
spill in and out of a gun store buying loads of ammunition
with faces like prunes stand outside Angell's Tavern getting drunk has a dead deer strung out across the back of his truck, skinning the carcass, its innards spilling loose
, an older, uptight man in fancy clothes, is driving through town in his big old Cadillac
He comes upon a hunter's truck, double-parked, jamming up traffic
Jack jams on his
Get the fuck out of the way, cocksucker
Jack turns to see a  and her two  on the sidewalk, listening and staring in shock
Mornin', Mayor
Jack smiles, a bit embarrassed
Jack notices a group of on the sidewalk, looking and pointing at something up in the sky
He looks up to see a small meteor plummeting toward earth
- Students file out of the open door for the day
Kylie, Starla's pretty student, is among them
She and her are looking up at the falling meteor
Prolly go find it later, sell it on eBay
- with a cleft palate turns his head to see the meteor, much closer to him
It's rushing down toward the treetops of a nearby forest
3
'  - framed wedding photograph of a very young Starla and a large man is sitting on a desk
The photo , with the impact of the meteor hitting the earth
, a large, indelicate man in his mid forties, notices the photos on his desk moving
He looks up from his desk and out his door, where there's a
Two  are carrying a large pane of glass, looking relieved they didn't drop it
Just a tremor, boys
Grant goes back to filling out the tags of file folders with a Sharpie
- Four cops --  , the town's young,   relaxed, and handsome Chief of Police, , an older,   toad-like cop, , a younger, somewhat goofy cop, and   , a mannish cop -- are standing stock-still in   the station parking lot
They
Did ya' feel that
They enter the station
- The four cops start to remove their holsters and so forth, finished for the day
always get afraid when that happens, 'cause what if the ground cracks open and you fall inside
It's so hot in there you get all burnt to nothin' like that -- (snaps) Happened to my uncle Barry
Wally and Bill  at him
Who told you that story, Trevor
My aunt
4
Your uncle Barry left her for a stripper up in Winnsboro
Trevor looks shocked, sad
, a slightly dim dispatcher, on his headset at the police operator's unit, swirls toward them, alarmed
Chief
We got a 'mergency over at the diner
- The four cops move in
There's a
Most of the patrons are standing
Back there, Bill
The Waitress nods back through the service window, into the kitchen, where a large  is hopping around stands on the counter,  with fear
- Bill, Wally, Trevor, Margaret, and the Waitress enter
The doe skips around
She slipped in, was eating trash
We seen it on , how they kill ya'-- Right
So we thought we best call in
Bill spots the open rear door, and tries to herd the deer toward it
Come on now, honey, door's this way
It's open season
Let's shoot her
She's just scared, Margaret
5
Also, Bill likes to take a female through the back door any chance he gets
Wally and Margaret
Trevor snatches a dish-towel and rushes the doe, using it like a cape
The scared doe leaps away from him, jumping onto the kitchen counter
She ain't a bull, Trevor
The animal kicks off a pot, which hits Margaret
Goddamn bambi-rat
As the doe jumps to the floor, she gets her hoof wrapped in a telephone cord
The cord is plugged into the wall, trapping the doe in place
Wally, Margaret, and Trevor attempt to dive for the cord, but can't avoid the doe's crazy, flying hooves
Get back
The other cops step away
Bill steps slowly toward the doe, speaking calmly
It's okay, sweetheart
Nobody's gonna hurt you
The doe looks at him, settling a bit
His voice seems to be soothing her
Bill gets closer
That's right
Just gonna pull this cord out
It's gonna be all right
The cops and restaurant folk look on in awe as the doe, breathing heavily, becomes still
Bill scoops close past her, and yanks the telephone cord out of the wall
Bill smiles
Then the doe runs forward, almost knocking Bill over, and streaks out the back door
Bill, Wally, Margaret, and Trevor move up to the doorway and watch the deer skitter off into the woods beyond, dragging the telephone, tied to her leg
Hell, she took a phone
Now them forest critters are gonna be calling us all hours of the night
6
Everyone
Wally pretends to be on the phone
Chief of police there
This a squirrel
Bring me a bag of peanuts, motherfucker
Everyone  some more
- Grant locks his office for the day
His  sees him going
'Night, Mr
Grant
See ya', Ashley
Grant walks across the workshop toward the door
He sees a crowd of  lounging around a glass-cutting table, at something
Some of them nod at Grant, and he nods back
But he's completely outside their circle
- sizable two-story suburban home
All the lights are off but one
(
) So  get home today, phone's ringing
It's Hank Wilcox
- Starla and Grant eat dinner in this well-decorated room
As Grant chatters, Starla occasionally smiles politely at him
Callin' for you
What the hell
said, 'Hank, that's a little bit outta line don't'cha think, a single man callin' someone's wife
' At night, nonetheless
Starla is quiet, almost afraid: 7
He's teaching environmental science, Grant
Probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester
Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy
It's just a work thing
Work thing hell, Starla
He just wants to get in your pussy
Him and most these other ones around here
That's where their minds is at, them sick fucks
Grant takes a big bite of food, stuffing his mouth
'll tell you, sugarplum, you're lucky you got me
You're too damn trusting
Without me to protect you, you'd get kilt one of these days
Starla nods
- Starla stares at herself in the mirror as she brushes her hair
She uses long, slow strokes, as if stalling
(
) Sugarplum, you coming into bed
Starla turns toward the door
She doesn't say anything for a moment
Just a second
Starla sets her brush down on the counter
She arranges it neatly beside the others
And walks into the bedroom
- Grant turns off the  as Starla gets into bed with him
It's almost completely dark in here
Grant crawls on top of Starla
He kisses her and grabs her in a way not meant to be rough, but is utterly without grace
8
After doing this for a few moments, Starla starts to push him off her
Grant, no -- 'm sorry, 'm just -- 'm not in the mood
Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy
Come on, baby, it's -- 'm sorry
don't just have some switch
Sure you do
Through Starla's nightgown, Grant pretends to flick one of her nipples
Flip
Then the other
Flip
That's disrespectful
Grant, peeved, gets off of her
He sits on the edge of the bed for a moment, in silence
Starla looks afraid
When are you in the mood, exactly
Seems to me that mood's as rare as winnin' the Goddamn lotto
Grant grabs his slacks off the valet and starts putting them on
Where are you going
'm just some big clown to you, ain't
That's not true -- Where are you-
Out
9
'   - Grant sits at the bar, knocking back a shot of tequila
He's getting drunk
He taps his glass
Hit me again there, killer
The  fills his drink
Hey, Grant, how's it you come to have the same last name as first
Parents thought it sounded pleasant, s'pose
Joke on me, ain't it
Grant notices a woman with a lot of makeup -- -- staring at him from across the bar, smoking a cigarette
Grant stares at her, trying to figure out who she is
She slides off her stool
She sashays toward him
She props herself on the stool beside him, leans drunkenly in toward him
Megan Halesy' little sister
Shit
You're kidding me
Nope
Brenda
Hell, you were -- Grant holds his hand only so high
was
And 'll tell you somethin', Grant Grant
's in love with you
Grant stares at her
My sister Megan, she's a big fat cow
Was then, even more so now
'd be thinking, what'd you see in her ain't in me
Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven
10
Hell,  was game
She
So does Grant
He stares at her, contemplating sinful things
He nods at her wedding ring
Who's the lucky fella
Fuck lucky
Never marry a damn half-Mexican
Already ain't
Married a gal named -- Starla Covington
Don't be ignorant
Everyone knows that
Fucking prom queen
Grant thinks
Yeah
Grant finishes his drink, and gets up to go
Where you goin'
Grant speaks more loudly than need be: Starla, she gets real worried 'bout me  stay out too late
Loves me too much, that one
He glances around to see if people have heard, and stumbles out
- Grant sits on a boulder beside a creek, looking miserable, downing a six pack
He throws an empty can into the creek, when he glances down and sees particles flowing down the river
Grant slides off the boulder
He kneels and examines the particles
They shimmer in the moonbeams coming down between the trees
Grant peers up the creek from where the particles are coming
11
He sees a gap on the edge of the creek, where water splashes and is diverted in streamlets down the hill
He approaches the spot, and comes upon a small crater on the side of the creek
The meteorite is inside the crater, but it's cracked into pieces
The rock seems almost organic, like a shell
The shimmery specks are part of the shell itself, flecking off into the creek and rushing downstream
Grant crouches
He touches the meteorite, and feels some sort of goo inside it
It's sticky
He notices a strip of the same slime leading out of the crater itself and into the woods
Grant, curiously, slowly, follows the slimy trail
He comes to a flurry of colorful wild flowers
Something is rustling the flowers ever so slightly
He moves in closer
gelatinous yellow organism slithers sluggishly between the flowers
The organism is a mound a few inches high, gross and veiny, yet as colorful as the flowers around it
small cavity on the apex of the organism constricts and expands lightly
guess it's not worth keeping secret that this thing looks a tad like a bright yellow vagina
What the
Grant is a little freaked-out by this thing, even frightened
He looks around for someone else
Hey, anybody 'round here
'Lo
No one answers
Grant looks down at the organism, unsure
He picks up a tree branch
Grant softly prods the organism with the pointy end of the branch
Nothing happens
He does it again
The thing pulses a little, and surges toward Grant
Grand pokes it again
small, thin quill -- a  -- emerges from the cavity in the center of the organism
The spore is quivering and, as it trembles upward, little bulbed spurs pop up as well
Grant slowly bends down to look at it when -- 12
The  suddenly
It strikes Grant in the stomach
Ow
Fuck
Grant yanks up his shirt, looking at a wound on his abdomen
He watches as the spore quivers and disappears inside him
He clutches his stomach,  in agony
He falls back into the colorful flowers
His body convulses
: -
' We see the insides of Grant's body, as if sliced in half
We   on the little spore, which is jittering up through his body, and into his neck
The spore keys into the base of Grant's cerebellum, and his entire brain crackles with a
Grant freezes in place, his fingers contorted up in front of him, silent
He's utterly still, a wax corpse
hippie   run into the area, looking for the source of the screams
The man looks down at the frozen Grant
Over here
The Camper crouches down beside him
Hey, man
You all right
Dude
Oh shit
The Camper turns from Grant to his girlfriend
think he's d -- Grant  suddenly, sitting up and grabbing the man, like a drowning man popping up above water
The Camper and jumps back
Grant sweats and heaves, trying to speak, but hardly can -- It's taking
my
brain
13
Buddy
Grant's eyes glaze over, and he eases off
He heaves there, momentarily confused
His eyes dart around, as if seeing his surroundings for the first time
Grant stands
You all right, man
Grant looks down curiously at the camper
Then he turns and stumbles away from them, out of the forest
That might of been a stroke, buddy
You better take it easy
'  - Grant drives down the road in his luxury pickup truck, sweating and blinking rapidly
- Grant steps out of the truck in his driveway, when he hears -- (
) Hey ya', Grant
Grant swings his head toward his , who is taking a happy  for a morning walk
What were ya', night-fishing again
You catch anything
caught a little somethin', yeah
Grant walks inside his house
- Grant looks around the foyer
- Grant creeps into the bedroom, looking around
We can hear the
Grant spots his face in a mirror above the dresser
He moves in close to the mirror, and stares at his own image
14
He pulls on his face a little, his eyes brimming with excitement
He smiles at himself
Grant looks toward the open bathroom door, where he hears the running shower
He creeps toward it
Grant peeks around the doorway
Starla is in the shower, soaping herself
She looks beautiful there
Grant tilts his head to the side like a dog
He watches her, mesmerized, even moved
- Starla is wearing a white towel and brushing her wet hair in the foggy bathroom mirror when she hears Air Supply's coming from the bedroom
She's struck by it
She moves toward the door
Opens it
- The shades are drawn, darkening the room
few candles have been lit
Grant is standing there, mostly in silhouette
He's silent, and he doesn't move
Hey there, sugarplum
Starla looks at him, stirred
Haven't heard this for a while
Grant walks toward her
He takes her hand in his own, lifting it beside him
He wraps his other arm around her waist
And he slow dances with her
Starla dances too, a bit hesitantly, a bit shy
never danced in a towel before
Wearing white, just like on our
wedding day
remember it
Starla nods
'm sorry about last night
get a little insecure sometimes, want to hold on too tight
It's just 'cause you're precious to me, Starla
() 15
(') But  swear to God, baby, 'm turning over a new Goddamn leaf
Okay
Starla nods, touched
Grant's eyes are teary
love you, sugarplum
Starla and Grant kiss, tenderly
Grant falls to his knees in front of her
He runs his hand over the curve of her hip, her thigh, her buttock, with as much fascination as lust
He pushes Starla back onto the bed
He lifts her leg, and kisses it, nibbles on it a little, scrapes his teeth on it
Starla is surprised by this, but enjoys it too: it's probably the most foreplay she's had in years
Grant crawls on top of her, runs his hands over her breasts, her face
Starla's hand moves over Grant's back, and to his stomach
When she stops, startled
Grant, what's that
She gazes down at the wound between them, on Grant's bare abdomen, where the spore entered him
The wound is yellowish, and surrounded by veins
Grant, embarrassed, pulls his shirt down
Just a little bug bite is all
Grant kisses and munches on Starla as she lies back on the bed, enjoying it
: '  - Starla is  Every Woman in the World as she drops coins into a soda machine and chooses Tab
, a heavyset black teacher, notices this
What are you so smiley about, girl
Oh, nothin'
16
Starla grabs her soda and sits down with Janene
Janene just stares
Just, Grant and  had a nice morning
It's been a while
Oh
You got that fresh-fucked glow, don't you
Janene
You slut
Hush
No shame
You're a married woman
He was
considerate
Maybe this is the start of a real change in Grant
- Grant is holding up his shirt, and looking at his torso
The wound on his side is blackened and gangrenous, and is starting to puff up into a veiny little spout
fuzzy bluish moss is growing in the crevices around the spout
pus oozes out
Grant looks concerned
He squirts some Neosporin onto his fingers
He massages it slowly into the wound
- Grant opens the refrigerator door and rummages around inside
He pulls out some bread
Some cheese
He opens the meat drawer
It's replete with cold cuts
He pulls out some Oscar Mayer baloney
Turkey
Pastrami and salami
He grabs every type of meat there is
Grant assembles a sandwich at the table
Two pieces of bread and some cheese
He starts putting the meat on
But he can't stop, piling more and more on until he has a little sandwich tower
17
He looks at it
Something seems off about it
He removes the cheese
Better
And then the bread
Even better
He stares at what is now simply a tower of cold cuts
Meat
After contemplating it for a moment, Grant stands and carries off the pile of meat
- Grant enters the garage through a door from the
He flips the lights on with his shoulder
He looks around
Grant spots an old file cabinet
He sets the tower of meat down on the oily floor and opens a drawer
It's filled with files
He closes that drawer, and opens another
It has manila file folders, but no files
Grant takes out the folders
He uses a Sharpie to write out "" on a folder
Then he stuffs all the baloney into the folder and files it away
He starts writing out ""
Grant flips through his alphabetically-filed meat: from "" through "
" But he doesn't look satisfied
- Grant stands beside the butcher's counter with a shopping cart
He peers dreamily in through the glass at the rows of steaks, pork chops, and so on
Meat
Howdy, Mr
Grant
You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend
Grant snaps out of his reverie
Sure thing, killer
What can  do you for
18
Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes
How many you need
Grant stares at the steaks
Well
having us a little dinner party
'd say
eight
No, no
fourteen
The Butcher nods, starts to grab steaks
Grant
Hell, what am  holding back for
Why don't you just give me everything you got here
All the rib eyes
Yep
And while you're at it, get me a few of them chicken wings
some pork loins
and, ooo, what's this here
Osso buco
- Grant backs his pickup toward the garage
Meat is piled into the bed
Wrapped packages of meat fill the seats around him
- Grant stands in the garage, tearing open the packing, and letting the loose meat slide into piles onto the floor, muttering: Meat
Grant rolls slabs of beef over the dirty floor and into a pile
skitters across the garage and around the pile
Grant peers around the pile and sees a  nibbling on some ribs
He realizes something
19
You're meat
The rat moves away from Grant
But Grant snaps out his arm with alarming speed, snatching the rat
It and wriggles in his grip, tearing and biting at him, trying to get free
Grant snaps its neck, and tosses the dead rat onto the pile of meat
Continues on
- Starla pulls into the driveway
She presses the button on her garage door opener
The door  but stays closed
Starla's confused
She gets out of the car and examines the door
She looks down and sees a new padlock, locking the door to the cement driveway with bolts on both sides
- Starla enters the house
She heads toward a door along the wall that leads to the garage
There's a shiny new lock on that door as well
She touches it, baffled
She turns to see Grant standing at the end of the foyer
He's in shadows, a little spooky in the darkness
Welcome home
Grant
Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage
Pause
No answer
You drilled into the driveway
Grant walks into the light
Yeahhhh
'm sorry
just got so excited about
your present
My present
You're my princess, aren't you
20
Okay
got a super-special birthday present for you this year couldn't risk you finding it, so had to put them locks on the doors
Pause
All right
have to clean up before dinner
Grant smiles at her
Starla confused, tries to smile back, then turns and heads up the stairs
Grant watches Starla's fine form from behind, somewhat lustily
But his leering gaze gradually turns into something darker, and he has a realization
You're meat
Starla turns
What
Grant snaps himself out of it
Oh, nothin'
Nothin'
See you in a sec
Starla smiles uneasily, and heads on upstairs
- Grant steps onto the front porch to get some air
He's blinking and seems a little dizzy
He gazes around the neighborhood: Down the way, a  in a little league uniform and his get out of their car and walk toward the front door
Across the street,    , a and his  are eating dinner
At another home, a   steps on a stepladder, changing the dome light on his porch
Grant stares at these individuals, looking like an animal ready to lunge at its prey, fighting the urge
21
Meat
He  a
Grant turns to see the beagle next door, tied to the tree,  at him
Grant looks around to make sure no one's watching
- Starla walks to get the paper in her robe, and she sees a , aged thirteen or so, stapling a :  flyer to a telephone pole, with a picture of the beagle
Roscoe's gone
The Boy's face is streaked from a long night of crying
You haven't seen him, have you
Starla shakes her head
'm sure he'll show up, Tim
The Boy nods, and walks to the next telephone pole to put up another flyer
- Grant moves up a hill, between trees, looking around for something
He comes to a stop, trying to remember which way to go
He does, and moves on
- Grant comes upon an old wooden barn
The structure is maybe a hundred years old, and long abandoned
It's spattered with graffiti
Grant stares at it
Grant gathers large fronds and other foliage in his arms
- Grant spreads the plant life over the floor of the barn
He arranges it, fluffs it there
His actions are very animal-like when no one's around
He seems to be making a nest
He sits back, looks at it
22
He's happy
: - Starla, dressed in her weekend finery, is looking in the mirror above her dresser, and putting on earrings
Grant, are you almost ready
- Grant looks ill
He is leaning over the sink, sweating, clutching his stomach
Yeah, hon, 'll be right there
Grant turns and pushes open his door
- Grant sees Starla sitting on the edge of the bed, her back to him, as she puts on her nylons
She doesn't know he's there
Grant stares at her, demented, and moves slowly toward her, stalking her
Something starts to push Grant's shirt up at his stomach, like a bellybutton erection
The thing slips out of his shirt -- a writhing, pointy tubule, aiming toward Starla's back
Grant looks at the nape of Starla's neck
Her delicate ear
He becomes confused; he softens
Starla turns to see Grant, his body now turned away from her
He's trying to push the tubule back down
What are you doing
You're pretty
Starla nods, confused by his behavior
23
- banner hangs across the front of the lodge, " '05" -- the first Friday of deer season in Wheelsy
Inflatable deer totems decorate the front of the wooden lodge
comes from inside
Partyers enter
Grant and Starla step out of his truck
As they do, one of Starla's students, Will, sees her and waves
Starla waves back
Grant notices this and grabs Starla's arm, a bit too hard, pulling her back
Who's that
It's just one of my students, Grant
Grant stares at the boy with distrust, and ushers Starla towards the lodge
Bill, Trevor and Margaret are hanging out on a large rock outside the entranceway, drinking beer
Bill watches Grant and Starla cross the lot
Trevor sees this
What's she see in that douchebag
That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev
Starla was seventeen when they got engaged
He was, like, in his thirties
No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger
Ain't no mystery to it
She's raised in them shanties off St
Luc
Dirt-poor
Gold-digger, huh
Hell, you don't know that, Margaret
Margaret shrugs,
Jack, the mayor, with his , stops beside them after she does, staring at her
Bill, you're Chief of police now
() 24
(') Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line
You're right, Jack
Margaret, you're fired
Margaret and Trevor
Jack shakes his head with disdain, and enters the party
- Wheelsy citizens celebrate
country-western band
Couples two-step
Starla and Grant move through the party
Grant looks around at the dancing and laughing bodies
Starla sees her friend from school
Janene
Janene  heartily and the two embrace Hey, Grant
Why don't you two catch up
'll go see what the boys are doing
Starla nods
She and Janene watch as Grant moves off through the crowd
He's been strange the past couple days
- Grant steps outside, and looks around
Across the parking lot is a playground
Two are spinning on a little carousel there
Grant starts toward them
- The Children , unaware of Grant inching up on them
Grant gets closer, excited, when he hears: 25
(
) Hey there, handsome
Grant turns and see Brenda Gutierrez standing there
Once again, she's very drunk
Must be fate, us meeting again like this
Grant smiles
Well, you might be right
Grant sees if anyone's watching
He circles around her
You're lookin' awful pretty
Shut up
Brenda
Where's the old half-Mexican
Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend
Grant smiles
- Grant holds Brenda's hand, and he pulls her between the trees
She
Where you takin' me, you bad boy
Grant stops in a secluded place, beside the creek, looking around
No one's there
He turns toward her, smiles
Take off your shirt, doll
Brenda looks at him, confused
Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know
26
What
Stuff you can never imagine
Feelings
Big thoughts
And love
Yeah
'm inclined to parlay it into somethin' more
So, go ahead there, beautiful, and take off your shirt
Brenda, though startled, leans back on a boulder and starts unbuttoning her blouse
After a moment, she looks at Grant, trying to be sexy while she does it
Grant looks at her in her bra
Nice
Grant unbuttons his shirt as well
As he removes it completely, he turns toward her
Brenda sees the wound on his stomach has blossomed into a veiny, blue-moss-encrusted yellow spout, huge and pulsing
Grant
What --
Grant grabs her
She tries to push his arms away
No, no, we -- Brenda gets up, trying to run away
But Grant grabs her necklace, yanking her back
The necklace snaps and falls into the creek beside them
Grant pins Brenda's wrists against the rock
She struggles to get free
Brenda's eyes widen as she looks down to see the writhing, tentacle-like tubule emerge from Grant's wound
She Grant shoves his hand over her mouth, shutting her up
He's extremely strong
She watches as the tubule twitches, feeling its way like a blind snake
The tubule comes to rest on her abdomen
Tears stream down from Brenda's eyes
It pushes into her flesh
Brenda goes into convulsions
Something -- a fluid -- pumps through the tubule and into Brenda
Grant watches Brenda without emotion as her body spasms there beside him
27
Then she falls back, unconscious
The tubule retracts into Grant's torso
- Starla is leaning over a wooden rail, looking at the lights of the town below
She turns to see Bill lean on the rail beside her
She looks genuinely happy
Hey, Bill
Starla catches herself, and looks around to see if Grant is watching
Don't worry
The lurker ain't around
checked
That's not funny
Sorry
Whatcha' doin'
Tryin' to get a buzz on
But 'm too buff
Too much muscle mass
Starla
What you up to
Just checking out the lights
Bill and Starla look out over the city together
Pretty, ain't they
don't know
've seen them so many times before
guess any spot gets boring after awhile
Well that's only if you're in the wrong spot
Starla looks at him
28
There's a place over there on the bluffs
When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope
Oh, yeah
Mm hm
But only a few folks know how to get there
Wally
Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train
Me
'll get Wally to show me sometime then
Starla  out loud
So does Bill
Oh, will you now
(
) Or Rollo's ghost
Starla
They turn to see Grant approaching
He's a mess
His pants are streaked with mud
Grant, where'd you go
Hey, Grant
Grant eyes Bill with suspicion
He grabs Starla
You ready, sugarplum
Starla nods
She looks at Bill and mouths: Bye
Bill watches Grant and Starla head off, as he downs the rest of his beer
Wally walks up beside him
Surprised you're able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long
29
Hey, Wally
Glad you're here
There was something  wanted to tell you
Bill  his fingers, trying to remember
What
Oh yeah
Fuck you, fat ass
They both
- Starla lies on her side, awake
She's staring at the dirt on Grant's pants, which are hung over a valet
Grant holds her from behind, sleeping peacefully
: - The front door of the precinct opens, and a confused Mexican  walks inside
He is trying to keep from crying
Three half-naked children follow him, clutching onto his clothes
The man walks slowly through the office, looking around for help
Margaret sees him from her desk
Sir, may  help --
' My wife, Brenda
think something has happened to her
- Starla, in her car with groceries, comes to a stop sign
She looks at the telephone pole beside it and sees that it's covered with flyers for missing pets
- Starla enters with a shopping bag
The lights are off
plays
Grant
30
No answer
Starla tries to turn on the lights, but nothing happens
Damn fuse
She passes the door to the garage, noticing the lock
- Starla sets down the bags on the counter, looks around
Grant
Again, no one's here
She sees a potted flower on the counter
green  is crawling up the stem, little by little
She stares at it, as if it's a portent
She hears a , coming from upstairs
- Starla moves slowly into this dark room, looking for her husband
It seems no one is here
Grant, where are y --
Starla turns, when Grant
Starla, startled,
Grant is sick and trembling
But, worse, he's been transforming
There are small pustules all over his face
Grant
Oh my God
What happened to your --
Heh
It ain't as bad as it looks, sugarplum
Dr
Carl was just here
had a reaction to a bee sting
He gave me a prescription
Said should be fine, in a couple days
Starla stares at him, mute and horrified
Don't look at me like that, baby
Please
'm gonna go get my
prescription filled
Grant grabs his keys off the dresser, puts them in his pocket, trying to pretend he doesn't hurt
31
'll get if for you
No
No
Heh
'll be right back
He moves outside the door, leaving Starla, shell-shocked
- It's too dark to see much in here, but we do see Grant putting meat into a garbage bag
- Grant looks around to make sure no one's looking, as he places the garbage bag full of meat into his trunk, closes it
- Grant moves through the forest, in massive pain, dragging the garbage bag
Grant comes upon the old wooden barn
- Grant enters
It is almost completely dark
He hears Grant peers over at Brenda, mostly in silhouette, sitting on the nest he has made
She's chained up and through a mouth gag
Grant walks to her
Her body is horribly pear-shaped and misshapen, like some tumorous pregnancy
Grant pulls her gag away
Grant
Grant, 'm hungry
'm so fuckin' hungry  think 'm gonna die
Brought you munchies
Grant pours the garbage bagful of rotting meat and dead animals out in front of her
Been saving for a rainy day
: Brenda's face, still mostly in darkness
She stares at the meat, simultaneously excited and repulsed
32
She looks up at Grant
Grant, 'm sorry if  did something wrong
think  gotta --  think should go to a hospital
Grant doesn't respond
Brenda's eyes trail back down to the meat
Brenda's hand reaches out, and grabs a maggot-infested pork chop, pulling it toward her
We , but can barely see, Brenda   on the raw pork in the nearly pitch black barn
'  - Grant gets into his pickup; he trembles and  as his body is wracked with pain and his body starts to transform even more
- There's a   on Starla's door
She swings it open to see Bill and Wally standing there, worried
Wally tries to see inside
Grant around
No
He went to the pharmacy
Pharmacy
He's got a
rash
Bill and Wally exchange a glance -- maybe this means something
Starla can see Trevor and Margaret, across the street, talking to another neighbor
Starla, you know Brenda Gutierrez
Starla shakes her head
Maybe she's ever called the house, or --
33
No
What
She disappeared Friday night
We got reason to believe foul play might be involved
Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock
The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant
Starla looks at him, surprised
The Deer Cheer
And Wally and me, we also saw him that night, with mud all over his slacks
Bill hands her his card
Have him call me right away, okay
Starla nods, distraught
Bill tries to smile kindly before he and Wally move out and off to canvas other neighbors' homes
Starla closes the door behind her, distraught, panicked
She looks at the foyer door, leading into the garage
Her eyes fall down to the floor, where she sees what appears to be blood drop stains near the door
She gains courage, and moves off toward -- - Starla throws open this door
She looks at old, unused sports equipment
She grabs an aluminum baseball bat
- Starla holds the aluminum bat, standing in front of the door to the garage
She hesitates a moment
But then she swings the bat at the lock on the door
She swings it again,
34
And again
Finally, the lock is knocked off the wooden door
Starla pushes away the useless lock, letting it fall to the floor
Starla steels herself, and slowly pushes open the door into the dark garage
As she does, the horrendous stench hits her
Terrified, she covers her face with her hand, and enters
- Starla sees what's there: not only a huge stockpile of rotten meat, but a dozen dead pets
They are neatly divided into various categories, and labeled: Pork, Ground Beef, Cats, Dogs
The walls and doorway have been heavily insulated so the smell doesn't sink into the home
She looks on the floor and sees poor, dead Roscoe the beagle, his tongue dangling out
Starla starts to
She moves quickly back inside
- Starla runs to the front picture window, and looks out onto the street
She can't see any of the cops
She turns from the window and picks up a cordless phone
She looks at the card Bill gave her, and dials the number
The phone , and: (
) You've reached Chief Pardy at the Wheelsy Police Department
Please leave a message and your call will be returned as soon as possible
There's a
Starla tries to speak through her , pacing: Bill, it's Starla
As Starla passes the large picture window, she doesn't see Grant staring in at her, his face now that of some diseased cephalopod
It's --  think you better come over right away --  think Grant's sick, he -- 35
Starla turns to see the monstrous Grant through the window
She just stops
They stare at each other for a moment
And then Grant lets out a
Starla turns and dashes toward the back of the house
Grant disappears from the window
- As Starla runs through here, she looks behind her at the front door to make sure Grant isn't following
- She runs past a wall of family photos
- Starla sees the door on the rear of the house, leading to the backyard
She arrives at it, and flings it open -- Grant is there
He lunges onto her
Starla  and drops the cordless phone, just as it starts
Grant crawls on top of her body
Starla reaches for the ringing phone, but he pins her hands above her head
He looks into her eyes
He's
His voice and breath are sick and raspy
Why'd you betray me, sugarplum
Grant, no
loved you
loved -- Grant, you're sick
Grant is about to cry
wanted you by my side, but you -- can't trust you now
Starla's , confused
Grant rips his shirt open
Starla looks down to see the tubule protruding from the 36
now enormous yellow spore on Grant's chest
The tubule feels over Starla's blouse, and then slips beneath it
It starts to poke into her skin
Noooo
Starla grabs the leg of a coffee table beside her
She the table into Grant's head
This hurts and surprises him sufficiently to let Starla get out from under him
Starla grabs the cordless phone, which is no longer ringing, and scurries behind the couch
She dials 9-1-1
Grant thrusts the couch aside
Starla crawls away again, when Grant attacks her from behind
He wraps his arm around her neck, pulling her back
He looks down at her with his sick, angry eyes, as his arm -- now apparently jointless -- curls around her like a snake
Starla gasps for air
Her face turns purple
She hears a  on the door
(
) Starla
Starla, are you in there
Starla tries to speak but she cannot
Suddenly, we the
(
) Starla
Starla, with barely an ounce of life left in her, sees Bill, Wally, Trevor and Margaret burst into the living room
They are surprised, to say the least, to see this diseased humanoid strangling Starla from behind
Fuck
The cops, freaked out, pull their guns
Grant makes a at them
They  at Grant, nicking him
Grant jumps away from Starla, back into the shadows, in anger and pain
Starla falls to the floor
Grant slips out the back door and away
The cops stare, gape-jawed and frozen with shock; what the hell was
37
Starla rubs her neck,
Bill Pardy runs toward the back door
- Bill runs out into the backyard
Wally runs up behind him
They look around at the trees surrounding the area
Grant is nowhere to be seen
We   and  from them as we
(
) Jesus, these past few days have been a trying time for us
- We   an altar where family members have placed little items that remind them of Brenda -- photographs, mementos, "Come home, Mommy" cards, etc
(
) We ask you now for the safe return of our beloved Brenda
Everyone in this modest little church has their heads bowed as the  leads the prayer service
Our sister
Our daughter
Our mother
Our wife
Brenda's husband, in the front pew, loses it,
His little children, beside him, fiddle in their seats
And we ask that you keep your light alive in her heart, wherever she may be
We ask all this in your name, Lord
Amen Bill Pardy is here, in full uniform, hat in hands
Amen
Amen
Bill looks around the church
He spots Starla, in the very back of church, head down, distraught, guilty
38
He also sees a group of   nearby, pointing at Starla, and whispering about her
- Starla's high heels  on the pavement as she moves quickly to her car
(
) Starla
Starla turns to see Bill coming after her
She stops
talked to the
They didn't have nothin' on file consistent with Grant's
symptoms
Starla nods
How about Brenda
New
No
We're hoping we find Grant, he'll lead us to her
Starla nods
The wind is strong
Her hair is flying over her face
Tears come to her eyes
You all right
Starla nods
Yeah
She moves away from him
Bill watches her go
- Bill enters
few  and  are bustling, making phone calls, etc
They all look tired, as if they haven't slept
Jack, the mayor, sees Bill
Bill
Bill spots him, moving quickly toward him
Shit
39
Bill, we need to talk
'Mornin', Jack
Bill crosses the station
Jack follows
Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece
We need to find Grant yesterday
The town council has lit a Roman candle and stuck it up my ass
Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business
Don't fuck with me, Bill
Your post here as Chief is in dire straits you don't work this shit out
They come to a desk with Wally and Trevor working away
Don't worry, we'll find him
(to Trevor) Anything new
Trevor shakes his head
How are you going to find him
Dude's a half-squid
Ain't many places he can hide
Sea World, maybe
Jack sees a  making copies nearby
He speaks in hushed tones: That young lady heard you say 'squid
' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria
Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria
Not today, Bill
40
Still, quit that talk
You yourself said it was dark in there
You don't know what you saw
We saw his arm was all bendy
Bastard obviously got lyme disease
What
Touch some deer feces out in the forest
Eat a sandwich without washing your hands
Then you got lyme disease
And that makes you look like a squid
'll tell you what, no one with lyme disease gonna win any damn handsome contests
Bill, Wally, and Trevor can't help but
Well, screw you all for laughin'
(
) Bill
Bill looks over at Shelby, on his headset at the dispatch unit
Another ranch attack
Up at the Castavets'
Bill nods for Trevor and Margaret to get up from their desks
They do, and start to move out with Bill and Wally
'Ranch a -'
What 'ranch attacks'
- :  dead rottweiler is lying on its back in the long grass, its gut split open and intestines spilling out, almost perfectly symmetrical
41
(
) It looks like one of them psyche tests
What do they call it
Bill and Wally are staring at the dog from above
Rorschach
What do you see
see a butterfly
Bill moves on through the windswept weeds
see we're fucked
Three ranches in three days
Margaret is taking measurements and writing in a note pad; she sees Bill
So,  think  got it part-way figured
You want to hear it
Bill nods
So Grant --  mean, we're saying this is Grant, right
Bill nods
Grant kills a cow right about here
See there's the blood, musta slit its neck
Margaret walks backward, showing the trail of blood in the crushed grass
So he drags the cow backwards here
Only he prolly didn't know 'bout the Castavets had them dogs
(
) Hey, look
Bill looks over at Trevor, standing up between the tall weeds, holding a dog's head in his hand
He knocked this'n's head clear over here
42
Put that down, numbnuts
Bill peers at the various slaughtered dogs around them
So the dogs attacked, somehow he slew 'em all, and he stole off with the cow into the forest
Trevor heads toward them
Bill looks off into the dark forest on the edge of the ranch
He's gotta be in the forest
All three ranches run alongside it
Think we should get up a search party, head in there
It's a hundred thousand acres
Be finding a needle in a fuckstack
Bill has a realization
He moves quickly for his car
Wally, come on
Trevor and Margaret, get some folks together
think  know where he's gonna hit next
- :  property map of Wheelsy is tacked to a bulletin board
Red Magic Marker circles are around various ranch properties on the edge of the city, next to an enormous forest
finger points to one of the red circles
So the night after Grant ran off, a calf went missing from here, the Raglans' ranch
Bill, standing beside the bulletin board
posse has gathered, listening intently: Wally and the usual cops; Jack; an  , probably pulled out of retirement; and a couple of recruits -- a  and a '
Bill points to the next red circle
Two nights ago, a mare was stolen from this property, run by Fitzgibbon, that old rancher with the cleft palate
43
Wally whispers to Margaret, amused: Looks like a chipmunk
Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally
Bill points to the next circle
And then we get here, the Castavets', where last night's shit-storm took place
see
It's like as if he's going in a pattern
Is that what you're saying, Bill
Bill nods and points to the next red circle
And if he sticks to that pattern he'll be here next
Belongs to a family, the Strutemyers'
Now know y'all are tired and you've barely seen your families
But we're gonna have to go there tonight, lie low and wait
The posse nod, agreeing
Let's get that son-of-a-bitch, Chief
Just remember, we don't know what we're up against here
So let's be careful
/ - Beside a small armory, Trevor loads a Benelli -1 super semiautomatic shotgun
Margaret checks the site on a Remington 700  rifle
Bill takes a Springfield -1A pump-action for himself, while Wally stuffs numerous pistols and ammo into a leather satchel
Trevor notices a dusty grenade on a shelf
Hey, Bill, we got that grenade we confiscated from them jokers wanted to use it fish for trout
44
Bill looks at Trevor, considering
Can't hurt
As Trevor puts the grenade into a side-pocket on the satchel, Bill sees Jack and the Older Cop, watching
didn't know the Russkies were invading there, folks
You seen this guy, you'd wished they was
- The posse loads up their vehicles, and start taking off out of the parking lot
Bill and Wally walk out to their police car
Bill tosses the leather satchel into the trunk
They get in the car, Bill starts the engine, when -- Starla Grant pulls quickly into the parking lot
Bill rolls down the window as she gets out of her car and runs toward them
Bill,  heard what you're doing
think  should go along
Why
Listen, it doesn't matter
gotta go
Bill starts to roll away, but Starla holds on to the car, following
Wait
Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her
How, unless you bring Grant in alive
Your best chance of doing that is with me
can talk to him -- He tried to kill you, Starla
He did
know
But  got him angry 'cause  wasn't calm
This time  could -- 45
Starla's on the verge of tears
Please, Bill
What happened, it's my fault,  know it
Starla, it ain't -- It is
He'd been acting strange
And the physical changes
should have told someone right away
But  was just blind
wanted to pretend it wasn't happening
If don't do what  can to help now, just couldn't live with it
Bill looks at her
He looks at Wally
Wally shrugs
Bill nods for Starla to get in
- Kylie is blowing on a cup of coffee
Her , , and two younger , aged 9 and 11, are relaxing after dinner
As Kylie's Mom picks up plates -- ' Kylie
What'd you do to your fingers
Kylie's Mom grabs her hand, looking at her very long fingernails
They're painted sky blue and spotted with minute teddy bear and bumblebee decals
Kiri Goshima done 'em
She's Japanese
' Looks like Pokemons done 'em to me
Kylie's sisters  out loud
Foreign stuff is classy if you knew something
Kylie's family sees,   , police cars pulling up by a gravel road
' Oh
There's Jack
want y'all to stay inside tonight
All right
46
Kylie's sisters nod
Kylie too
- Kylie's Dad steps onto the front porch of this quaint family farmhouse
He sees Jack heading toward the ranch, and waves
Jack gives a little salute, while muttering to the Older Cop
This turns out to be a mountain lion we're gonna look like a damn bunch of idiots
The Redneck and Good Ol' Boy make their way to the ranch as well
They see Bill with Starla
Didn't know it was date night
The Good Ol' Boy
'll be expecting you toss my salad at the end of all this then, Charlie
' Shut up
- The posse fans out over this grassy land where the cattle graze, finding places to hide
The sun sets behind them
: - Darkness has crept over the ranch, and the beautiful, pastoral scene has become distinctly more sinister
The wind blows hard,  through the long weeds
rusty rooster windmill atop the old barn twists and on its half-bent perch
piece of tarp hangs down from the barn roof, incessantly against the wooden wall
Trevor and Jack; the Redneck and the Good Ol' Boy; and Margaret and the Older Cop are hidden around the ranch, waiting, watching or dozing
47
- Inside the barn, the wind is only slightly quieter, and it's darker
Bill, Starla, and Wally are here
Bill peers out through the doorway at cattle drinking from the trough
He looks at Starla; her head tilts to the side as she nods off
When her head falls all the way, she snaps back up, and catches Bill gazing at her
Bill nods and smiles
She doesn't smile back; she's embarrassed and miserable and this is the last place she wants to be
They sit there for a moment in the dark
Hey, Starla, remember that time when you were a kid and you came knocking on my window in the middle of the night
Wally looks at them
Starla here's twelve
Guess  was fourteen
said, 'Starla, what the hell you doing out there
' She tells me she's running away to Hollywood to become a big star
She said she knew  was in , and she was gonna need a bodyguard
Invited me along
Wally
Bill smiles
Starla is embarrassed, but grudgingly enjoys the story
said, 'Starla, if there's anybody can take care of herself,  think it's you
'm gonna have to decline
' (to Starla) How far'd you get
About the bus stop
Ranger Rick here called my dad
Ha
cop from the get-go
You son-of-a-bitch
You fucked up our fame and fortune, Bill Pardy
48
Yeah, maybe  did
- Jack smokes a cigarette as he keeps an eye out for the cow killer
The burning ember of the cigarette is blown off by the wind
Jack searches for it in the dry grass, trying to catch it before it starts a fire
He crawls forward, slapping the ground, when he glances up and sees
large, shadowy shape hulking through the trees on the edge of the forest
- Bill, Starla, and Wally see Grant Grant emerging from the forest
He has transformed into something much more monstrous: a giant, gangrenous, slug-like beast, a clump of cells and tumor-like protuberances
He has various tentacle-like-arms growing out of him, like overgrown eyes on a potato
As opposed to just having the disease, he now seems to  the disease itself
Grant
- Jack and Trevor watch in amazement as Grant slithers across the field, his large, dark, watery eyes searching out prey
Jack turns to Trevor, pissed, and whispers: You said 'squid'
It got worse
The Redneck and the Good Ol' Boy watch too, mouths dropped
The diseased Grant slithers through the grass just a few feet beside Margaret and the Older Cop
They duck below the grass, looking as if they're going to have heart attacks
Grant approaches a cow
The cow makes a little  of protest when he gets too close, and steps back
The Grant-creature stabs one of his tentacle growths into the cow's neck, piercing it
The cow stumbles, choking
Blood spurts from her neck
And she topples over
49
- Bill and Wally stare out the window, motionless
What we gonna do now, Bill
Cuffs won't even fit on 'im
Starla musters courage
She stands, and moves out of the barn
Starla, where you
- Grant wraps a feeler around the cow's horns, and starts dragging it back in the direction of the forest
- Bill motions through the barn window to Margaret
- Margaret motions to Trevor
Trevor motions to the recruits
And Starla moves slowly in toward Grant
Grant
Grant turns and looks at her with his half-human eyes
His breathing is loud, raspy, and sick
He sees, in a wide circle around him, the nervous posse standing up, their guns at the ready
Starla moves even closer
Bill and Wally are coming in close behind her
Grant
It's okay
As Starla and the posse get closer, Grant looks almost scared
His eyes dart around from cop to cop
You're just sick is all
But we'll take you to get help right now
'll stay by your side, Grant, just like  swore  would
For better or worse
Remember
50
Grant's huge milky eyes betray that he does
Okay
The posse inch in closer, tightening the circle
Grant lets out a   of protest
All of the posse stop, terrified
Everything is quiet and still except for Grant's gross breathing
Deep: In, out
Okay, Grant
It's gonna be all right
Grant  again: a warning
He looks from Starla to Bill, with hurt, jealous eyes, and
Then Grant's eyes close to half-mast, and he turns away
His tentacle tightens around the cow's horns, and he again drags it toward the forest
While Bill tries to decide what to do, the Good Ol' Boy nervously blocks Grant's path
He aims his pistol at him
' You stop right there, you son of a bitch
don't care what kinda leprosy you got
We need to find that girl
Now you can make this peaceful, or you can make it hard
Pause
Grant and the Good Ol' Boy stare at each other
And then Grant  out a tentacle-arm, whipping it up the front of the man's body, and back
The front of the Good Ol' Boy's whole body is split neatly in half
For a split second, he remains alive: the two different sides of his split head look down in disbelief as his organs spill out from inside him
And then he topples over
Fire
Fire
The posse  at Grant
Starla covers her head
Grant is struck; he  in pain
He lets go of the cow
He slithers with incredible speed off toward the forest
Bill and the other posse members take off after him like hounds on the heel of their prey
They  madly
51
Starla watches as the posse follows Grant into the woods
Starla stands alone and worried a moment, and then she darts off after them
'  - Kylie is running a bath
She hears   in the distance
She peers out a little window above the tub, trying to see where the shots are coming from
- The posse run through this very dark forest after Grant, leaping over brush and rocks
They're nervous, but also excited, as the primordial hunting urge takes over
Their eyes are filled with anger and bloodlust
They're able to follow Grant only by catching glimpses -- a flash of flesh between trees, a tentacle disappearing around brush
There he is
Over there
They  at the creature, taking chunks out of trees, but missing
He's too fast
- Grant slips around a boulder and splashes through a creek, and into the plentiful trees beyond
He rustles thick fronds as he moves up alongside the creek
The posse run up the creek itself, splashing, trying to peer through the leaves to get a shot at Grant
Jack, carrying his revolver, trips and falls in the creek
He cuts his knee on a sharp rock
He stands, and keeps going
They come to -- - The posse come up out of the creek
They've completely lost track of the diseased man-beast
They stop, out-of-breath and looking around
They whisper: 52
Where'd he go
We ain't never gonna find that girl now
The Redneck is  with rage
'll kill that asshole what he did to Charlie
Bill sees Starla run up behind them
He waves her back
Starla, get the hell out of here
Starla takes a couple steps back, but doesn't leave
She watches there, half in shadows as the posse creep around, searching for some trail of Grant
Margaret looks down into the bubbling creek
She sees it's turning red
She looks up the trail of red, which is rippling downhill in the water
The red flow starts somewhere near a boulder
Bill and Wally are searching in front of the boulder
Margaret , but they don't, Grant pulling himself up on a tree branch and  behind them
Blood from a shotgun wound is dripping into the creek
Grant, pissed, lifts a tentacle
Bill
Bill turns as the tentacle swings down toward him
He falls back; the tentacle slashes inches from his face
Bill  his shotgun up at Grant, but Grant is already slithering swiftly back into the thick brush
The posse squeeze themselves though the brush, following
- The posse emerge on the other side of the brush, only to be confronted by a terrible odor
They cover their noses and mouths as their faces shrivel in disgust
What the hell's that smell
It's something dead
53
The posse gaze up at the old ramshackle barn where Grant had brought Brenda
It's coming from in there, ain't it
Margaret looks at Bill
Think he's inside
Bill takes the lead, carefully approaching the barn
The posse follows, their weapons drawn
The closer they get to the barn, the more unbearable the smell becomes
Only Bill, intent on the task in front of him, doesn't react to the stench at all
Bill leans his ear in close to the front door, and listens
Through the door he can  a
Bill and Wally exchange a look
Bill steps back
He and Wally aim their shotguns at the door
Bill nods to Margaret, and gestures for her to open it
Starla watches all this from the rear
Margaret swings open the door
- Bill and Wally move cautiously but quickly inside
But they stop suddenly, in disgust and horror
Oh
It's Brenda
And she doesn't look good
Her weepy little head is stuck to the front of a huge fleshy orb, which is what her body has become
This enormous ball of flesh is nine or ten feet tall
Vestigial fingers protrude from the sides
She is utterly immobile
Her flesh sloshes, slightly and constantly; a thousand snakes seem to be slithering beneath her thin, tight, bruised skin
The woman is in great pain
She
Her mouth and chin are stained with blood
The posse and Starla enter behind Bill and Wally and are equally astounded
Oh, shit
They see the source of the awful stench: 54
Brenda is encircled by the rotting carcasses of cows and horses and forest critters
They are mostly skeletal, as they have been largely devoured
They're swarming with flies
The stench is so bad the posse cover their faces with the bottom of their shirts
The  Brenda looks desperately at Bill and Wally
Something's wrong with me
Uh, yeah
Bill and Wally get in a little closer
Brenda, um
didn't want no one to be seeing me like this
As the posse inch closer, Brenda's whole body suddenly a bit -- like whatever's inside her is trying to get out and to the posse
Brenda  in agony
The posse jump back
They stare as she recomposes herself
How are my boys, Bill
Are they all right
Boys are fine, Brenda
Uh, what's -- what's happening here, exactly
'm so fucking hungry, Bill
'm so hungry
just never knew anybody could be so hungry
Brenda tries to smile in a way she might charm her Daddy into giving her candy
This is creepy as hell
Would you mind handing me a piece of that possum there at your feet
Little bit
Trevor gags and runs out of the barn
- Trevor vomits into some bushes
55
- Bill eyes poor Brenda
think we best get you to a hospital right quick
What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill
Again, Brenda
Her body
Why's she doing that
Her tumors is moving
Bill, get her to stop that shit
It hurts
Her body lurches forward
She sobs
Help me
Help
And then
Starla notices that Brenda's skin is starting to    on her side
Bill
Little fuckers are tearing me aparrrr-
Brenda  like a woman giving a thousand evil births at once and her body   in one part; and then, in quick succession, , and
Bill looks out one of the windows
Grant is peering in at them, smiling
He led us here
And then Brenda's body   , like a water balloon hitting cement, and thousands of little with slippery black-red skin like slugs spill forth
The horrid creatures, eight inches long and a few inches thick, swarm over the posse, completely covering them before they can react
56
- Trevor sees the things flooding over the posse in the barn
The parasites are especially drawn to the posse's heads
Because there are so many, the weight of the beasts knocks most of them down
Trevor runs, but the things make it out the doorway, covering him like lava in One Million
, and he buckles
- parasite slithers quickly and fluidly into Wally's mouth
He gags on it
His eyes flip back up into his head, and his body starts to spasm
Jack tries to pull one away from his face, but it's too slippery and it disappears inside his mouth
His body, too, convulses, and he spits up blood
Bill notices the parasites slithering into the mouths of the Redneck and the Older Cop as well; whites of their eyes, bodies convulsing, spewing blood
Bill sees the things oozing up Margaret's neck
Margaret, cover your mouth
Bill sees Trevor outside the door in the dirt, trying to slap the parasites off
Bill yells to everyone: Don't let 'em in your mouths
One starts to get in Bill's mouth as he speaks, but he slaps it aside
Margaret pulls her shirt over her face
Starla
She puts her hand over her mouth as the parasites rush up her
She's knocked over, and falls back onto the floor
parasite slithers between Starla's lips -- when, suddenly, a  thrusts down, pinning the creature to the dirt, stopping it from oozing further into Starla
Bill is holding the knife in one hand, his other hand firmly over his mouth
Bill swats more incoming parasites away from Starla's mouth
He covers her mouth with his free hand
He lies on top of her, mushing their bodies and faces as closely together as possible so the things don't get into them
The parasites swarm all over them, flapping their slimy little tails as they try to fight their way inside their mouths
But Bill holds tight to himself and Starla
57
Eventually, the parasites give up on Bill and Starla, and begin to slither away
Bill watches as they crawl off the posse and filter out of the barn in a squirmy mound
Eventually, they're gone
Bill takes his hand from Starla's mouth
Starla looks around
She sees Margaret lift her face from the ground, shivering, holding her shirt over her mouth
They gaze out the front door of the barn
- Trevor pulls his face from the dirt and stands
He spits violently and wipes the dirt off his tongue with his wrist
They wanted us to eat 'em
Why would they want that
- Bill is trying to make sense of it all
He gazes down at Brenda's body, her bloody skin and misshapen skeleton spread out over the floor, split open like an enormous bloody tiger rug
He looks around at the posse lying on the floor in mangled positions, their mouths and lips covered in blood, still lightly convulsing
He gazes out    to see the parasites rushing away like an ugly wormy army, shaking the brush as they head off in different directions
: '  - Parasites crawl over rocks and out of the forest and onto the ranch
The Strutemyer farmhouse looms nearby
'  - Kylie is taking a steamy bubble bath
Her head is back, her eyes shut; she's enjoying the warm water
The tub faucet drips lightly in an uneven rhythm
'  - The parasites squirm up the side of the house, sticking to the wood siding
58
'  - Kylie glances out the window beside the tub, at the starry sky and crescent moon, beautiful and still
There's a  on the bathroom door
Kylie turns toward the door -- as she does, a parasite crawls across the window behind her, streaking a moist slimy trail
' Kylie
You're gonna turn into a plum in there
Prune, Mom
Plums turn into prunes
'  - Kylie's Mom is at the bathroom door
' know what turns into what
You got school tomorrow
Finish up in there and get to bed
Kylie  in vague agreement
Kylie's Mom trots down the hall, to another door
She  once, then opens the door to -- '  - Kylie's younger sisters lie in single beds, reading Goosebumps by bed-lamps clipped to the headboards
' Time to turn in, ladies
'  1 Just a couple more pages, Mom
' Come on now
The girls  in lazy protest, but still turn off their reading lamps
' 'night
'  1                  '  2 Night, Mom
Night
59
'  - we see Kylie's Mom start to close the door
' Sleep tight
Don't let the bed bugs bite
Numerous parasites slither  , up the side of the house, approaching the girls' bedroom window, which is open a few inches for air
'  - Kylie's Mom shuts their door completely
The girls turn on their sides and close their eyes to sleep
And the parasites pour in through the cracked window
They slither over the walls
Their slimy black-red bodies contrast sharply with the pretty flowered wallpaper
'  - The door cracks open, and a parasite enters
It slithers silently over the linoleum tiles
It arrives at the base of the tub, and crawls up the side
Kylie continues relaxing, her eyes closed
She doesn't see the parasite enter the soapy bath water at her feet
Kylie hears a   and peers down
She spots the creature swimming toward her between her knees
Kylie  and scrambles up to get out of the tub
As she clamors out, she slips and falls to the floor
The parasite squirms up Kylie's wet naked back
Kylie again, jumping up as she tries to slap the thing off
Mom
The parasite winds toward her lips
Kylie goes to grab it with both hands, but it slips through them
The thing slides into Kylie's mouth as she looks down at it
Kylie snatches the very end of the parasite's tail
Her long, teddy-bear-spotted fingernails pinch it there, digging into the parasite's flesh, barely stopping it from sliding completely into her mouth
It wildly flaps its tail like a docked trout, desperate to enter her
60
Kylie falls to her knees
Her eyes roll back in her head, and her body spasms while she holds tenuously onto the very tip of the parasite's tail
We   to a  of Kylie's face: a slight white electrical-telepathic charge can be seen  inside her mouth
: ' We are  through some amoebic landscape, microbes and cytoplasm and cells, and to: '  -    - ' Perhaps the memories of some creature not of earth
Its eyesight is not like our own; it's in grainy black and white and amber outlines
Various images  in quick succession, including the following: -- We are on top of an alien , pinning it down
It beneath us as we tear into its flesh, feasting
-- All around us, diseased monstrous  feed on more alien animals
They lunge toward them and pin them down, ripping them apart, like some National Geographic documentary shot in Hell
-- In  , unfamiliar plant life around us grows sick and withers, dying out
--  group of diseased monstrous beasts   in uniform pain
They buckle to their knees; now they're dying
-- The diseased beasts feed on their own appendages
Kylie tries to regain control of her mind
Her eyes fight against flipping back in her head
Tears pour down her face
She pulls the parasite out just a bit
But then it  back into her and there are more inside her mouth -- '  -    - -- We are   through a creamy, gelatinous yellow
An opening slit widens in front of us, and we see Grant slowly bending to look at us, the forest behind him
61
'  -    - ' -- We watch Starla soaping herself in the shower
-- We make love to Starla, our hands on her face
-- We sit over a convulsing Brenda, impregnating her with our tubule
-- We see the posse members coming in toward us
With a last, desperate effort, Kylie yanks at the exhausted worm, pulling it fully from her mouth
It flaps in her fingers
Kylie spits up blood
Kylie tosses the parasite away from her
Though slightly crippled, the little bastard writhes back toward her
Kylie spots her curling iron on the counter; it's plugged in, the red light is on
She grabs it, and swings it into the wormy thing
The parasite  and trembles with pain
Smoke rises from it as Kylie digs the curling iron in deeper, burning it, and, finally, killing it
Kylie lifts the iron in front of her and looks at it
The dead parasite is stuck to it, dangling from the metal
Mom
Kylie drops the iron
She quickly steps into her clothes lying on the floor
She runs out of the bathroom and into -- '  - Kylie runs to the stairway
Mom
Mom
Kylie stops
Dozens of the things are slithering up the stairs and up the handrail towards her
Kylie hears her '
She looks in their direction, running toward their room
Emily
Jenna
Kylie tosses open her sisters' door
62
'  - Kylie's youngest sister is on her knees on the bed, a parasite sticking out of her mouth
Her eyes are rolled back
Her arms flail spastically
The slithering beast wags its tail as it disappears down her throat
Kylie's other sister is backing into a corner, with parasites crawling up her body
She's  bloody hell, trying to slap them off
Kylie runs toward her to help
Kylie slaps the parasites off her sister
But there's too many and they're too fast
They slide into her sister's mouth
No
Nooo
Her sister's eyes flip back in her skull as the thing disappears completely, and she starts spitting up blood
Kylie sees the parasites around the room coming at her
There's a clear path toward a window
Kylie runs to the window, and shoves it open
As the things approach her, she crawls out -- '   - Kylie steps onto this shingled, angled canopy over the front porch
She turns to see the parasites slithering out towards her
She looks down
It's probably too far to jump, but she has no choice
So she jumps down onto -- '   - Kylie lands, hard, tumbling over
She glances back at the front of the house
she sees her Mom and Dad, eyes rolled back, convulsing, spitting up blood
More parasites are crawling towards Kylie through the grass
She spots her family's old Luv pickup truck on the driveway in front of her
She breaks for it
She throws open the front door, and jumps inside
The things approach, crawling in after her
Kylie tries to slam the door shut, but it won't; many things are stuck in the door jamb
63
They  in a chorus of pain, trying to wriggle toward her
So she  the door , and , and she slices the little bastards in half
- Kylie makes sure none are inside
She feels for the keys in the ignition
There aren't any
The creatures crawl up and over all the pickup's windows, trying to get in
Slithery shadows cover over Kylie, leaving her in almost complete darkness
Kylie crouches down in on herself, and
- Starla, Trevor, and Margaret stand, wide-eyed and shaken
All three seem to be in some mild state of shock
Bill, suppressing his desperation, is trying to make contact on his police radio
11-41
We're gonna need paramedics out here right away
We got four men down
Bill listens for a response, but there's only
He presses the button again
Shelby, you there
Still, only
Bill tries another frequency
Shelby, this is Bill
We got an emergency here
Goddammit
Bill steps outside the doorway, to see if he can get reception
Trailing off: Shelby
64
Starla sees Wally's body on the floor
His skin is white and corpse-like
His mouth is streaked with blood
Starla crouches beside him, and takes his pulse
Her hands are visibly shaking
Is he alive
Starla looks at Margaret, and nods
Praise Jesus
'Praise Jesus
' That's fucking pushing it, Margaret
Trevor looks about to cry
What the hell were those things
You ever seen anything like that
You ever heard of anything like that
Margaret shakes her head
Trevor looks at Starla, who also shakes her head
Me neither
And  watch 'Animal Planet' all the fuckin' time
Bill re-enters
No reception out here
Bill, 'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there
That's a long ways
Them worms are out there
'll keep my mouth covered
No
'll go
The three of you, you wait here
Get these folks, out of the barn
The stench and rot can't be any good for 'em
Margaret and Trevor nod
As Bill starts to leave, Starla grabs him
65
Be careful, Bill
Bill nods
Makes a feeble attempt at a smile
He jogs off into the forest
- Bill runs into the small glade, and looks around, trying to remember which way he came from
He gazes between some greenery, some distance away, and spies a long-lashed deer munching on foliage
couple more deer and a fawn are eating as well
Bill looks at them a moment, peaceful, perhaps a sign of some hope
And then a parasite crawls up the deer's neck and slithers into its mouth
Parasites crawl up the bodies and necks of the deer behind it
The deer buck and flounce and scratch trying to get the things off of them
Bill runs away as fast as he can
- Trevor and Margaret carry Jack out of the barn
He's bloated, corpse-like and covered in varicose veins
Margaret is wearing a gag-like swatch of clothing tied around her mouths, to protect themselves
Trevor's gag is down around his chin so he can chatter
It's got to be some Goddamn biological weapons
Government's testin' 'em out on us
'Cause who gives a shit if Wheelsy disappears, right
They set down Jack and head back toward the barn
hope it ain't contagious
'll be pissed as hell  turn into a big mollusk
'll fuckin' sue, swear to God
Starla, also wearing a gag, is kneeling beside Wally, who is similarly sick and bloated
His lips are parched and cracking
Starla squeezes a wet cloth, dripping all the water onto Wally's lips
Then she stands, and heads toward the creek
66
She doesn't see Wally open his eyes behind her
He sits up, and stares over at Starla with milky eyes as she kneels down beside the water
Starla dips the swatch of clothing into the creek, re- wetting it
She stands, and turns, only to see Wally directly in front of her, standing between trees, almost completely covered in darkness
Hey, sugarplum
Pause
Starla pulls the gag from her mouth
What
Wally speaks with Grant's cadence
Marriage
It's a sacred bond
Just like you said
Starla stares at him
Wally almost looks weepy
'm sorry 'bout trying to strangle you and all
lost -- Lost my head
didn't want to do none of the things  done
Not kill them pets
Not make Brenda a womb
But it's my nature, ain't it
How can you blame a one for actin' according to his nature
Starla, too freaked to speak, takes a step back from him
wanted to tell you what was going on
But  didn't - didn't think you'd love me no more
never knew
love, Starla,  -- Trevor and Margaret are setting down the Older Cop
They see Wally standing
Margaret pulls down her gag
Wally
Wally turns and stares at her like some angry animal
You all right
Wally doesn't answer
67
Maybe you better sit back down
You don't look so good
Margaret
Trevor's staring at something
Margaret follows his eye line
Jack and the Older Cop are sitting up, staring at her, just like Wally
The Redneck stumbles into the barn doorway, also staring at them
' /
- Kylie is still alone in the Luv truck
The windows are clear; the parasites have abandoned their quest, just as they did with the posse in the barn
But Kylie stays in the car, trembling, afraid to leave
She  a
She sees her parents and her sisters come stumbling out the front door of her home
They're also bloated and diseased
Their chins and shirts are stained with the blood they spit up
' Kylie, honey, you okay
Come on out
Her family lumbers up to the truck
They peer in with their milky eyes
Her youngest sister pushes her face up close to the window
'  2 Hi, Kylie
It's me
Her family tries the door handles, but they're locked
' Open the door, sweetie
know we don't look so good, but your mommy and daddy love you
Get away
' Now, Kylie, there's no excuse why not to be with your family
This is family fun day, isn't it
They continue  the door handles, over and over
They  the windows
Kylie
Her sister speaks in a singsongy voice: 68
'  1 Kyyy-leee, this is your last cha- ance
Her Dad leans over and picks up a large rock
He carries it toward the truck
He holds it up over the windshield
Kylie  as he  it down
The windshield , but doesn't shatter
He holds it up again
' - Bill, out of breath, runs out of the forest -- '  - Bill emerges on the edge of the ranch, stretching five or six acres out in front of him
On the other side of the field is the gravel road, where his police car is parked
Beside the field is the Strutemyer's farmhouse
Bill  a
He turns to see the diseased Strutemyers in their driveway, all holding rocks now, smashing the pickup's windows
Hey
The Strutemyers stop, mid-swing
They turn toward him
Kylie sees Bill through the rear windshield
She unlocks the door, and jumps out of the car
What's --
Kylie runs past her family and up to Bill
She grabs onto him, and hides behind him,
What's going on here
Kylie's Dad's cadence is also like Grant's: ' Well, hello there, Pardy
What happened to you, Dwight
Kylie's Dad looks down at his own bloated arm
' Poison ivy out back, maybe
69
' We're itchy
Kylie is obviously in shock
They're not my
They killed
Okay
'all just wait in this spot
'm gonna call the paramedics for you
Kylie can come with -- (
) Hey there, killer
Bill turns to see the  with the cleft palate, now diseased, holding a shovel
He swings it into Bill, knocking him down
Kylie
Her family runs in toward them
She looks around to see a couple more   rushing toward them through the fields
The Cleft Palate Rancher stands over Bill and raises the shovel to bring it down again
Bill feels for his shotgun, which has fallen into the dirt beside him
He yanks the trigger
The  hits the Rancher in the foot
He buckles
Bill stands, pulling Kylie with him as the other diseased folks rush toward them through the fields
Come on
Bill and Kylie dash toward the cluster of cars as the diseased chase them
- The infected posse -- Wally, Jack, the Older Cop, and the Redneck recruit -- are all coming in towards Trevor and Margaret
Now, what'd  say
'all just sit down
You need to get some Goddamn rest
You're sick
Starla watches this, by herself, next to the creek
She eyes a rifle in the dirt
70
Jack grabs a fistful of Trevor's hair and restrains his arms
Wally pulls his pistols from their holsters and tosses them into the dirt
Let go
Margaret goes to grab her pistol, when the Redneck opens his mouth wide and -- ; that is, he sends a yellowish globby-stream shooting out of the back of his throat
The glob on Margaret's hand
Margaret , drops the pistol
It burns
Margaret looks at her hand as the gleek-liquid sinks into her skin
The hand is swelling monstrously
It's soft
Parts of it are nearly dripping off the bone
What'd you do to my fuckin' hand
Jack opens his mouth and  too -- shooting the stream- glob forward and onto her neck
Margaret  again, grabbing onto her neck
Margaret tries to speak, but she struggles just to breathe, as her neck puffs up, impeding her thorax
Meat
The Older Cop buries his fingers into her neck
The puffy flesh comes off easily; it's soft, almost creamy
He stuffs the flesh into his mouth, eating it
As Margaret topples over, dying, the other posse members turn to look at a very freaked-out Trevor
The Redneck opens his mouth at him, when -- (
) Let him go
The posse turn and see Starla, who has made her way over to where the rifle was on the ground, and is now pointing the rifle at the posse, trembling
Trevor, come on
Surprised, they release Trevor
What'd you do to her
71
Jack stares at Starla
He too speaks with Grant's cadence
There you go, sugarplum
Why you choosing camps 'fore you hear -- Both sides of the story
Both sides of the story
Why are you talking like Grant
The posse moves toward her
Starla is
The posse makes a   sound, then speaks again: 'Cause  am Grant
'm you husband --              'm you husband, Goddammit -- You swore to honor and obey -- Obey me --                      Obey me, so put that Goddamn gun down
Don't come any closer
'll
shoot
You ain't gonna shoot me
You always needed me to protect you
You for damn sure ain't got the balls to -- Starla  Wally, blowing open a big crater into his face
Wally falls to his knees
Starla and Trevor look on in shock, as they see
slithering parasite squirming out of the crater on his face -- out of the Wally's brain
The little thing squirms down Wally's body and slithers off quickly into the woods
Wally falls over, dead
The sick posse look at Starla, surprised, infuriated
And then they leap at her
Starla tries to shoot them
But she's out of ammo
72
She and Trevor turn and dash away as quickly as their legs can take them
-  - Trevor and Starla run in a zigzag pattern through trees rooted closely together, panicked, breathing heavy
Oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit
'  - Bill and Kylie arrive at his police car
Bill throws the door open, and shoves Kylie inside
As he starts to get in, he turns to see the two little girls closing in
One opens her mouth and  -- it shoots out and lands on the car right beside Bill's hand
The other little girl opens her mouth to  as Bill jumps into the driver's seat
He slams the door shut just as the oozy liquid splashes on the window beside him
Bill is grossed-out by this, but he doesn't have much time
He goes to reload his shotgun, when he remembers
Shit
Ammo's in the trunk
He grabs the police radio
Trevor
Margaret
-  - Trevor turns and sees Jack, the Redneck, and the Older Cop leap powerfully over the brush behind them, coming in fast
But he's able to grab onto his radio
They killed Margaret
'  - Kylie's two sisters jump onto the hood,
They rocks on the windshield
Kylie
(into radio) Where are you
73
(
) We're coming your way, man
Bill  the car forward, knocking the sisters off the hood
Then he slams on the brakes
He looks back and sees the two little girls running toward the car again
And he sees the mass of diseased ranch families also running toward the car
Kylie is  and
Go
Go
Please
But, instead, of pulling forward on the gravel road, Bill turns up and onto the ranch itself -- back towards the running diseased
My friends are still in the forest
Bill speeds the police car over the dirt field, trying to avoid approaching ranchers
Some leap at the car, holding on and getting tossed aside
Bill zooms back toward the trees
Just as Bill gets a little headway on the diseased, the car gets stuck in some mud
The wheels spin, spraying mud, as the infected approach
-  - Starla looks back to see Jack right behind her
'  - The infected arrive at the car
Bill just lets his foot off the gas, and sits there, letting the ranchers leap onto the car
Kylie looks at Bill, panicked by his choice to do nothing
We need their weight
Bill slams down the gas again, and the car zooms forward
The diseased get knocked off
Dumbshits
Bill rushes toward the trees of the forest
74
- Starla keeps running, when she trips and falls
She looks down to see she stumbled over old barbed wire fencing, now long fallen and curling on the forest floor
Starla forces herself up, as Jack closes in
Jack grabs onto her blouse,  furiously
When he  something and looks over to see: Bill's police car, cruising over the forest floor, directly toward him
Jack, frightened, lets go of Starla
He's about to get hit when -- The police car suddenly stops, jammed between two trees, inches from Jack
Jack smiles, and moves toward Bill -- but Starla rises behind him, holding a sharp rusty stake from the barbed- wire fence
She thrusts it forward, hard; and it pops out the front of Jack's neck
Jack turns to look at Starla, and topples over into the leaves
Bill backs the car out from between the trees
He sees the Older Cop and Redneck coming in toward them
Come on
Trevor and Starla get into the car
The Older Cop watches them back away and yells: Starla
- The police car pulls up and out of the forest
The car is in bad shape
Steam rises from the smashed grill
Bill looks to his side; he's down a bit from the Strutemyers' ranch
He pulls away, heading back toward town
The foursome sit in a stupefied daze
Starla's beside Bill
Trevor and Kylie are in the back
Bill grabs the police radio
Shelby
75
Nothing
Everyone notes this, worried
Bill tries again: Shelby, you there
For a moment, there's nothing
And then: (
) Yo, Chief
How y'all doin'
Bill and Starla look at each other, relieved
- Shelby sits at the police operator's unit, peppy
You dig that rat out of the hole
Listen, you got any reports of
don't know what you call 'em
They look like big slugs, only fast
Slugs
No
'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's
Ha ha
Shelby -- Oh, shit
hope she ain't a police radio aficionado
If so,  apolog - Shelby, shut up
Keep an eye out for these things
If you see 'em, keep your mouth covered
Otherwise they'll go straight down it
All right
Shelby looks confused, and nods
Are you nodding
Yeah
76
can't hear when you're nodding
Sorry
We'll be there in ten minutes
Bill hangs up
Kylie is clutching onto herself, hollow- eyed, in deep shock
She mutters, almost unintelligibly: The worms are in their brains
Starla, Bill, and Trevor look at her
- The    , through the forest, and to a  on the Redneck, who is hunched over Margaret's body, eating her flesh
a   of the ' : a parasite is imbedded into his brain; its tail hangs down his spine, wagging just a bit
(
) Drivin' 'em around
Bill stares at Kylie like she's insane
She's right
We saw one -- one came out of Wally's head
Yeah
Sort of his eye, it came out there -- Kylie, how do you -- Kylie is rocking back and forth
Kylie, how do you know that
Kylie shakes her head
She doesn't want to answer
Kylie, honey
Please
() 77
(') lot of bad things have happened to you today, we know
But we need your help to find out what's going on
Kylie
was in the bath
It tried to go inside me and  -- for a minute became it
The worm
got it out
What are they
Part of him
Who
(pause) Who
Mrs
Grant's husband
Starla stares at her
But not always
was -- He was
other stuff too
What other stuff
Kylie kind of points at the sky
He's a fucking Martian
Martian is from Mars, Trevor
Kylie tries to think
For real it looks like a needle
Its real face
But it always gots another
() 78
(') He goes from place to place, worlds
planets
killing 'em
He takes over half of what's alive and eats the other half
Till they're gone
They stare at her, freaked out
Now he's here
He went in Mr
Grant
Through a wound on his stomach
Kylie nods
He took him over
His body
His -- his brain, everything what he knew
He's only been dumb stuff before - amoeba-things, and rhino-things
He liked being human
Didn't want to change
And you said the worms are part of him
They're all linked, like one creature
When one sees you they all see you
An animal that doesn't procreate
It spreads, grows
living disease
(to Kylie) So the way to stop this thing is to stop Grant
Kylie shrugs
The police car starts
Shit
The car slows, and comes to a stop
- Bill, Starla, Kylie, and Trevor step slowly out of the car
They look around the deserted road
79
The wide-open night is shrouded in darkness
Quiet
They can see the lights of Wheelsy down the road in front of them
Bill speaks into the radio again, as he gets his leather satchel of weaponry out of the trunk
Trevor grabs ammo from the satchel to reload his pistol
Shelby, we broke down on 22, a mile outside town
Come pick us up
(
) got to leave my post
Do it
The foursome walks down the road, toward the city
Starla and Bill are in the lead
Hey, Starla
She looks at him
Was always curious why you
married Grant in the first place
Just never seemed outta love
know what people say, Bill
Remember, back in high school worked at my father's gas station
Bill nods
Grant used to get filled up every day
knew it was just to see me
He was too old -- But he was handsome
And he had that big ol' Lincoln then
flirted with him
Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure
Guess would have flirted with him too
Starla smiles, thinks
80
My father, he was -- he was real close to evil
People didn't know
Still don't
From the time  was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me
don't mean just like a smack for smart-mouthing
he took a real enjoyment in it
And when  turned eleven or twelve, things
well, they got worse
Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck
When you wanted to run away, called your dad
That wasn't a good night, no
'm sorry
Starla shrugs it off
Anyway, Grant rolls in one day fill his tank with like an eighth- a-gallon as usual
And he notices my lip's all swollen up, and starts asking me how it happened
don't know why  chose then, why Grant -- guess  saw an opportunity
And told him everything, first time told anyone
Grant was furious
He picked up a tire iron, walked straightaway into the garage, and beat my father half to death
You say it's not about love, Bill
But that was the closest thing to it  ever knew
Pause
Grant asked me to marry him a few weeks later
felt
safe with him
Bill nods
Starla looks at him, smiles
After all this shit tonight, know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood
81
Hell, Starla
always regretted that
Starla looks at him, moved
Trevor looks at Kylie, shivering and terrified
Don't worry, kid
Pretty soon, we'll be in town, everything'll be fine
- slithering parasite squirms over a paint-chipped sign that reads "  ,  , ," featuring early-'sixties graphics of a utopian future
to the road, where hundreds of slithering parasites squirm into the city
They divide off in thin lines heading toward the various homes
We    a  on a  , through which we can see an   in spasms with a slithering thing in her mouth
We   the  of the   , where we can see a  gathered around a , feasting on his goopy flesh
- What's that
Our foursome look up to see a Buick Century parked at a haphazard angle in the middle of the road
The driver's side door is open
The headlights are still on
They look at each other
Bill takes his flashlight off his belt and aims it in front of him
They all slowly approach the car, in the darkness
Bill aims his flashlight into the Buick
The keys are still there, but no one's inside
Trevor looks at the grill of the car
It's dented
They musta hit a deer
Probably got out to see if it's okay
Bill and the others look around
82
Bill hears a  sound behind him
He turns, aiming the flashlight downward
is lapping a thick purple tongue on the wound of a dead man
The sick creature is mostly hairless and pink and covered in veins
Bulbous black eyes hang on the sides of its head like a goldfish's
The diseased deer glances up at Bill and  a low growl
Fuck me
The deer springs upward, bringing his hoofs into Bill's chest
Bill is knocked violently to the gravel, dropping his shotgun and satchel
The deer rears back and brings his hoofs down into Bill again
They  Bill's head against the hard road
Kylie, Trevor, and Starla see diseased deer coming in at them from different directions
The deer  like dying rabbits
Bambi-rats
Trevor aims his pistol at a  jumping toward him
He , misses
The deer knocks him down
The deer stomps his feet, rearing up and down on Trevor's ribs, almost like a little dance
The deer tears at Trevor's sleeve with decidedly carnivorous teeth, forcing him into letting go of his gun
Kylie
She dives into a small space beneath a rock overhang on the side of the road
She watches what's going on from there
Starla sees the Buick a few yards away
She glances beside her to see the largest diseased deer of all, a , careening toward her
She dashes toward the Buick as fast as she can
leaps onto Bill, biting into his shoulder and tearing at his flesh, so now he has two deer on him
Bill is bleeding, dizzy, and disoriented, but he's able to turn, just a bit, to see the barrel of his shotgun above him
He tries to scoot himself back as he's being battered
He reaches up for the shotgun; but the tips of his fingers barely graze the muzzle
Starla arrives at the Buick, and starts to crawl into the front seat
But the horned buck is upon her
He bites into Starla's ankle
She
83
He yanks back on her, half pulling her onto the road
But Starla grabs onto the steering wheel with all her might, and pulls against the horned buck's massive power
The deer on Trevor starts pulling him off, dragging him down the road as he
Kylie, underneath the rock overhang, watches Bill try to scoot himself back and reach for the shotgun
It's just a little too far away
She works up her nerve and slowly starts to crawl out toward him
As Starla is stretched between the horned buck pulling on her ankle, and her hand on the steering wheel, she's able to flip on her side and turn the keys in the ignition; the
She reaches one hand down to the floorboard, pressing on the gas
The Buick lurches forward, wrenching her away from the horned buck's mouth
Bill reaches again for the barrel of his rifle
It's too far away
But then he sees Kylie, at the butt of the rifle
She reaches out and pushes it just a little, into Bill's hand
Bill grips the muzzle like a baseball bat, and swings it into the face of the deer jumping on him, knocking the beast back
The deer tries to stumble forward again, but its whole head and neck have been knocked askew
It topples over, dead
Bill flips the shotgun forward into his hands
He stuffs the muzzle into the tumorous doe biting into his leg
The deer looks at him
Blood is running down Bill's face and he looks half-crazed
Bill glances down and sees the telephone wire wrapped around her ankle
Bill pulls the trigger, destroying her
He stands, looking around for the deer with Trevor
It has dragged him a fair distance down the street
Bill once, missing it, and again, hitting it straight on
Kylie looks around to see more diseased deer running through the fields toward them
Starla pulls herself into the driver's seat and backs up alongside her friends
Throws open the passenger door
Get in
84
- Bill fumbles for the radio controls
Shelby
Trevor looks out the window, watching the deer fade away behind them
When  buy my zoo, 'm leaving them things the hell out
Shelby
(
) Hey there, Chief
Shelby
We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away
(
) Don't worry, Chief
- Shelby, sick and bloated, speaks into his radio, as he moves down the street with a hoard of the infected
Already on our way
Kylie turns her head, and glances out the window
And Starla, Bill, and Trevor turn to see -- An  barreling straight towards them
It  hard into the side of the Buick
And  the car back, across a short lot, and through the glass storefront of a flower store
- The Buick and  are destroyed, amidst the ruins of this store
Shattered vases and flowers surround them
Glass fragments dangle from the window frame
Some fall and to the floor
85
Starla lifts her battered head from the wheel
She looks beside her to see Bill and Trevor, seemingly unconscious
She looks back at Kylie
The impact has killed her
Her neck is bent at an ungodly angle
Bone juts up out of her skin
Starla looks out her rear window and sees the  door open, and the   stumble out
His body is battered and broken, but, still, he lumbers toward her
He tries to speak, but his jaw is broken, and only a comes out
Starla struggles to get out of the car
Eventually, she does, and she falls to the floor, amidst the broken glass from the shattered window, and the water all over the floor from the broken vases
She sees the moaning driver limping toward her
He's still trying to speak, but he's unintelligible
The driver gets close, ready to grab her
Starla sees a metal bar
She grabs it
And  it into the diseased man's shin
He topples over
She crawls onto the fallen driver and brings the metal bar down into his head, again and again,  and with fury
Starla looks down at the man, who is very dead
Starla looks up to see dozens of   coming at her, from down the street, between buildings
They see Starla there
Starrrrrlaaaaaa
Bill and Trevor limp up behind Starla, pulling her toward a door on the back wall
Come on
- Bill closes and locks the door behind them
- The diseased townsfolk surround the little store on all sides
They
86
- What the hell are we going to do
Just block the doors, any way you can
Bill grabs hammers and nails off a hardware bench
Trevor knocks things off shelves and yanks up the metal shelving
Starla looks doubtful of this whole activity
But still, she helps
The storeroom has two doors
They start nailing anything over them they can
Trevor sees some slithering parasites coming in through a crack in the upper corner of the room
Goddamn snakes
Trevor aims his pistol at the things and starts shooting wildly at them,  up the whole room
Bill and Starla see slithering parasites coming in from other cracks in the room as well
They also  at them
Dust is all around; they can hardly see
Bill runs out of ammo
He grabs a hand-held Black and Decker electric circular saw and turns it on
He starts jamming it into the parasites, cutting them up, and putting big slices in the floor
They  with pain
- The diseased townsfolk  and  their hands on the walls, almost rhythmically, like some tribal ritual
Some push on the doors
- Bill hears something  behind him
He turns to see a little hole in one of the doors
Three diseased fingers slip inside, trying to pull away more
Bill uses the circular saw to cut off the fingers
An arm pops through the door
Bill slams the circular saw into that
Blood spurts
Bone grinds
87
man's eye peeks through another crack
Bill jams the circular saw through the crack and into the man's face
- The -  backs away from the hole, clutching his bleeding eye
- Bill spots a wide piece of shelving falling off the door across from him
He runs over to the space, when the circular saw stops turning
Bill turns to see he's accidentally unplugged it
- The diseased townsfolk have all gathered on one side of the building now, putting all their efforts into tearing down one door
Some have even climbed onto the roof above it, curling off the gutter and roofing overhead
- Bill grabs his leather satchel, and starts to reload his shotgun
Starla sees that the diseased townsfolk have almost torn down one of the doors
This is stupid
Starla goes to the other door, and starts tearing away the planks they nailed there
What are you doing
We can't make it
Just get away, when you get the chance
What
He wants me, Bill
'm going to get him to take me to him
See if you can follow me, and kill him
No, Starla
No
88
Another full metal plate is pushed off the door ' face peeks through
Trevor swirls to see it
The Man , hitting Trevor on his chest
Trevor looks down, in shock
And the whole door and part of the wall bursts open
The Diseased pour inside and around Trevor,  all over him, splattering his body with the burning liquid
Trevor starts to puff up, swelling, becoming soft
They grab him
Nooo
Bill grabs Trevor by the wrist, and tries to pull him away from them
But Trevor  in agony; the liquid has made his flesh too soft
His entire body splits apart like wet tissue, his organs spilling out in front of them
Bill stares down in shock, still holding Trevor's arm
Starla has pulled away enough boards of the other door
She throws it open
None of the diseased are on this side of the building anymore
She moves outside
- Bill follows her
Two   appear, and running toward them
Bill  them both
And he makes a break for it, running as fast as he can across the street
He turns, expecting to see Starla right behind him
But she has stayed behind, staring quietly at the ground
Starla has tears in her eyes
She motions with her head for Bill to go
Bill is confused
The diseased townsfolk come up around Starla from the sides of the flower store, no one paying attention to Bill
They encircle her, slowly
Some  angrily at her
She's too disgusted or fearful to even look in their eyes
They  with ,  breath
Starlaaaaaaa
Starlaaaa
And they , in a cacophony of simultaneous voices, all the deep angers, fears, frustrations, and jealousies they inherited from Grant Grant, such as: - You said for better or worse
You lied
' gave you everything
Loved
You
89
It's not just about lesson        wanted you by my side, plans
Hank Wilcox wants         sugarplum
But 'm too your pussy
ugly now, huh
Your daddy'd still be            You always thought  was a fucking your every hole          joke, ain't you
weren't it for me
' You like Pardy better'n me
That's who you want to screw now
Grant
Please
They surround her
They touch her body, her ass, her breasts
Pull on her clothes
She trembles
'm sorry
know  haven't behaved how you -- how you want
know
Don't
hurt
me
Starla glances down to see a diseased dog licking her calf, tasting her
We need
to
talk
grabs the side of her neck and face
' Then talk
Then talk
Not here, though, okay
Not all of you
'm not used to --  want to talk to your face, Grant
Your more real face
Your -- The diseased townsfolk grab Starla, enveloping her, and start dragging her away
few townsfolk remain behind
They look around for Bill
- Pardy
Where are you, Pardy
But he's nowhere to be seen
They  angrily
- Bill runs as fast as he can across the street here -- the same direction the hoard took Starla, but down a block
90
- Bill falls against the side of this building, hiding in a dark crevice
Down the way, he can see numerous dead bodies, and a  chased down and tackled by some infected townsfolk
Some diseased townsfolk wander by Bill, looking for him
Bill crouches down so he isn't seen
Pardy
Pardy
Pardy
Come on out, Pardy
We've surrounded the town, you prick
Ain't no way outta here
Bill waits for them to pass
When they're gone, Bill looks up toward the next street -- he can see the hoard moving Starla across that street
He makes sure no one's looking, and follows her
- One of the diseased pushes Starla too hard, and she falls to her hands and knees
They keep pushing her
She stumbles back to her feet and moves on
She's almost hyperventilating
- Here, the Diseased Townsfolk around Starla stop
She looks up to see that they've led her onto her own front yard
Starla gazes up at her home: The diseased have done a little remodeling
Part of the front wall has been torn away, replaced with some primitive thatched woodwork
The front doorway has also been partially destroyed
Because of the sloppy reconstruction, the roof is caved-in and sloping
Diseased people sit in meerkat-like poses on all sides of the Grants' home, watching out for trouble
- Bill, out of breath, arrives across the street
He can see Starla standing with the diseased
He hides behind some shrubs
91
- The diseased push Starla up between them, violently, to the front door
Starla stops at the dark hole on the front of the house
It's pitch black inside
She looks back at the rotting faces behind her
And then slowly enters
- Starla balks at the smell
She looks beside her at the garage; the wall has been torn out, and this has become Grant's feeding area, with rotten meat, including some bodies, in a pile
Starla steps slowly forward, looking around
Grant
Starla can see into the shambles of a kitchen from here
- Bill looks at the diseased surrounding the Grant home
They seem impossible to get through
Bill eyes the house next door, maybe twenty-five feet from the Grants'
He makes sure no one's paying attention for a moment, and he darts across the street to a parked car
The diseased don't see him
Bill gazes down the street beside him
The sun is just barely beginning to rise
They don't have much time to move in the darkness
Bill makes a break for the house next door
- Starla walks into the kitchen
Cooking supplies and condiments are scattered over the floor
She spots a meat thermometer on the floor amongst other utensils
She glances out the rear window
Diseased people are guarding the backyard, looking away from the home
She grabs the meat thermometer
She snaps the thermometer part off the top, discards it, and shoves the long metal spike into the seam of her skirt
92
Suddenly, Starla hears     , the song she and Grant danced to earlier, starting to play through tinny speakers
Starla looks up through a missing section of ceiling; she can see a tiny piece of Grant in the bedroom above her
Grant
We should talk
'  - Bill has made his way into the backyard
He looks over at the Grant home
Some diseased townsfolk in the backyard could conceivably see or hear him
He tries the back door, but it's locked
Bill notices a window slightly open
He starts to push it up
It
He peers over at the diseased
They don't hear
He throws the window up further, and crawls inside the home
- Starla stands at the base of the stairwell
The  is louder
Grant
She starts to ascend the stairs
They  beneath her feet
'  - Bill peeks out the window, careful not to be seen by the diseased humans around Grant's
Bill can see Starla in the home next door, walking up the stairs
Bill runs toward the stairwell here
- Starla looks down the hall
Most of the walls have been torn away
Between wooden beams, Starla can see Grant's cumbersome mass, his back to her, in what was once the bedroom
In front of him, the   on the  player
It starts into the   on the album
Grant uses one of his crusty tentacles to push the back button
93
starts over
Starla walks toward him
- Grant keeps his back to her
Starla takes in the room
Photographs from their scrapbooks are all over the walls: photos from their wedding, and vacations, and family parties
Hey, Grant
Starla walks around Grant, giving him a decent berth
You did some real interesting decorating here
Grant watches her from the corner of his sad, purulent eye
Hey
Starla walks by a window
Look, the sun's starting to come up
Starla starts to open the drapes
'   - Bill happens to look through the neighbors' kid's bedroom and to the home across the way where Starla is pulling the drapes away from the window
She sees Bill there
- Grant  angrily at Starla
She quickly closes the drapes, not letting on she saw Bill
Sorry
didn't --  didn't know you wanted it dark
'  - Bill walks into this young boy's bedroom, filled with airplanes and sports memorabilia
94
He peeks around the window frame at the Grant bedroom window, now closed to him
He makes sure his shotgun is loaded
- Starla tries to change the subject by walking to a wall with the photos
You like these memories, huh, Grant
Grant looks away from her
Starla moves toward him, almost seductively
You like being called Grant, don't you
Grant is silent
She gets closer
think you do
You really do
You like being Grant
Like when we danced
And when you
made love to me here on the bed
Remember that
Grant looks embarrassed
Starla becomes more brazen
know you've been alone, Grant
Almost forever
From here to there to there to here, there's never been another one for you
Starla almost looks as if she's about to cry, out of compassion for him
Grant
Grant,  could help you
Be with you the way you want
See,  want to live
've never had much use for this world, not really
You and , together, we -- She touches his tentacle with her fingers
He moves it back, and  a little
Starla moves her trembling fingers toward him again
She sets them on his tentacle once more
He glares at her distrustfully, breathing his deep, sick breath
You don't trust me,  know
That's why  brought you someone, Grant
95
Starla looks into his eyes
It's Bill
He's in the house next door
Just look
'  - Bill glances down to see a diseased man looking up at him
In fact, they're all looking up at him
Bill is confused
- Grant looks at Starla with sad eyes, perhaps touched
Starla smiles nervously, expectantly
See
brought him here for you
As an offering
To prove  love you more than him
Grant wraps his tentacle around Starla
Starla, though obviously disgusted, touches his face with her hand
'  - The diseased townsfolk break down the door, moving into the downstairs below Bill
'  - Bill hears them approaching
He  the window, and crawls onto a small mock-balcony outside
- Starla moves slowly in toward Grant, as if to kiss him
Grant looks, well, joyful
And then she yanks the metal spike from her skirt and it into Grant's eye
Grant , blind and bucking
Starla  the spike into his other eye
And she  him again, shoving the spike into his forehead, where it stays
Starla leaps to the window
She throws open the drapes
96
Now, Bill
Kill the motherfucker
'   - Bill raises his shotgun and  as Starla jumps away from the window
- The   and the shot strikes Grant
He , swinging his tentacles aimlessly around the room in fury
One tentacle  Starla against the wall, probably breaking a rib or two
Another tentacle  the player, squelching the song
'   - The diseased townsfolk enter the kid's bedroom, rushing toward Bill on the balcony
But Bill won't stop
He the shotgun again
- Grant is struck in the head
He starts slithering out of the bedroom, feeling his way out
'   - Bill is out of shells
He drops his shotgun
He grabs the grenade out of the pocket on the black leather bag
- Starla, clutching her ribs and barely able to move, pulls herself up on the window
Bill tosses her the grenade
She tries to catch it, but misses it
It lands on the carpet
She see Grant's tentacles slipping away
She tries to move but she's hurt bad, bleeding
'   - The diseased  at Bill, but Bill throws himself forward, letting himself fall through the flimsy balustrade -- 97
- Bill lands hard on the lawn between the two homes
He grabs a
38, and stands beside the window on Grant's house
Through the window he sees Grant barreling down the stairs
Bill  Grant with the
38,  the glass
He  the clip into him
The diseased townsfolk surround Bill, grabbing him
Grant, using the others' eyes to see, snaps his tentacle forward, wrapping it around Bill's neck, raising him up
Grant - Starla appears at the top of the stairs, clutching her bloody side
She has the pin in one hand and the grenade in the other
With all her remaining effort, she lobs the grenade behind Grant
Er
It
- Grant's exploding flesh sends Bill flying backwards
- Starla is thrown back
- Around the house, the diseased's eyes gaze lifelessly upward as they each plummet to the grass
: - Bill unwraps what's left of the tentacle from his bruised neck, and looks around at the dead diseased
Grant's splattered flesh is around him
98
Bill hears a quiet  sound
He looks around him
And then sees, down at his feet, what is actually a distorted piece of Grant's cerebellum
Sticking out of a new organic slit in the cerebellum is the quill-like spore
It quivers and trembles upward, its little bulbed spurs popping out
- Starla crawls forward to look down through the smoke: most of the second floor has been blown away
Her mutated husband is just a mass of flesh and alien organs
- Starla comes around the side of the house, holding a paper towel roll to the slice on her ribs
She sees Bill standing there
She smiles
Hey
Bill smiles too
Hey
- Bill and Starla hobble down the town center
The leather bag is slung over Bill's shoulder
Everything around them is dead: the victims who were being feasted on, as well as the various diseased
The torture is over, but no life remains
- Bill finds an abandoned Nissan Maxima in the middle of the street, with the keys still in it
Starla, over here
- In the Maxima now, Bill and Starla pull around a toppled ambulance and through a spouting fire hydrant, and out onto -- 99
- The sun is bright and beautiful, glistening on the car
Bill and Starla breathe more easily and smile a little as they head up this long, barren road outside the city
- Bill and Starla pass through a small block of stores
Starla gazes out the window to see people -- real, actual, : men and women and children -- going about their daily chores
Tears come to her eyes
Bill grabs Starla's hand
She clenches his tightly
We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here
Yeah
Good
- The Maxima pulls into the station, and stops
- Starla and Bill pile stuff up on the cashier's counter -- Band-Aids, gauze, alcohol; Power Bars and Gatorade
The rings it up, staring at them because of their wounds
Comes to 32
87
Bill pulls money out of his pants pocket
As he does, Starla glances down
His arm pulls up his shirt, and Starla can see the black and yellow wound there on his stomach
She turns away, looking around, confused
Bill pays, smiles at the cashier
There you go
- stunned Starla steps with Bill out of the station, moving toward the car
100
Starla stops
Shit
-  forgot
wanted to get aspirin
She starts to move back inside
Bill stops her
'll get it for you
Ibuprofen or aspirin
Aspirin
Bill smiles, and goes back inside
Starla moves quickly with the bag of stuff toward the car
- Bill pays for the aspirin, and walks out with it
- Bill walks out; the Maxima is still there
- Bill gets in the driver's seat, puts his keys into the engine
We'll just head up here into Bishopville, get checked up in the hospital
Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all, huh
Okay
Bill turns to smile at Starla
She's aiming the
38 at his face
Tears are streaming down her cheeks
Please, Starla
'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody -- You took Bill
It's my nature
101
And this is mine
Starla pulls the trigger, the
- As the Maxima sits in the lot, Then we hear the
- Bill's dead body is slumped over the steering wheel
Starla really can't bring herself to look at it, as she reaches across it and toward the door handle
- The car door flips open
The horn stops blaring
And Bill's body is kicked out of the car, sliding onto the pavement
,  : SLiTHER - Starla  the tears away from her face
She glances out the window to see the cashier peeking out of the cashier's station
Starla scoots over into the driver's seat
She shoves the car into drive
And she takes off down the road, not looking back
Starla's blanched and numb but the tears still keep coming
