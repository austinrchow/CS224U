She opens the back of a   , and pla ces her duffel bag inside
That done, she lets the map drop from her mouth, catches it in her free hand and turns to hug her father,

Kimberly and Mr
Burroughs turn to see -- , 19, tall leggy brunette
Tan, tight tube top revealing her pierced navel, Kimberly's best friend
She walks up the driveway with her bags
Just kidding, Mr
Don't worry, 'll keep an eye on her
(sarcastic) Oh, that makes me feel a lot better
Shaina throws her bags in, shuts the back and climbs in the
Kimberly hugs her dad, kissing him on the cheek
know this is the first time we've been apart since
But everything's gonna be okay

just -- Kimberly hugs him tighter
Cutting him off
Your mother would have been so proud of the way you've handled yourself through all of this
(softly) know, Dad
(
) Hello, the guys are waiting
Kimberly gives him a quick kiss, jumps behind the wheel, starts the car and pulls away as Shaina cranks up the stereo
Buckle up
Mr
Burroughs waves as the girls roar off
As he looks down he spots an   left by Kimberly's
As he drags his shoe across the stain, a   blows past his face
as a look of concern crosses his face

Up ahead waiting in line, is Kimberly's red
Waiting in line, is Kimberly's red
(
) Watch it
Kimberly accidentally  the bumper in front of her while daydreaming
She calls out to the driver in front: Sorry
My fault
Shaina looks over, concerned
In the backseat, the guys  and laugh hard and some of Frankie's milkshake comes out of his nose
Want me to drive
No, 'm good
Shaina looks at Kimberly as a  suddenly hits Kimberly's window
Kimberly spins around, startled
Kimberly stares transfixed at the Old Woman, who stares back with chilling intensity
The kids ad-lib "Let's go" and "Fucking freak
" The Old Woman's , sending oranges rolling down the on- ramp
The Old Woman breaks eye contact with Kimberly as she rushes to retrieve them
The signal turns from red to flashing yellow
Kimberly pulls the   onto the highway, looking in the side view mirror to see the Old Woman look up at her in -
Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother
Blo w me
As she looks back from the mirror and reacts to an ominous electronic road sign that flashes ":   180 "
Kimberly merging into traffic,   with a speeding yellow mini- bus carrying a high- school football team
Kimberly nervously jerks the wheel to the right, then realizing she's speeding towards the road construction barrels, she swerves back left, right behind the mini-bus at the last moment
Kimberly pulls around the mini-bus as rowdy football players tackle each other, yelling: Pile up
Pile up
Pile up
Kimberly flicks on the radio and we hear    by / at earsplitting volume
Kimberly and Shaina jump from the shock and reach to lower the volume
Kimberly, disturbed by this, hits  -- an oldies station from Nervous Norvus'  album
Christ, is this tribute to Princess Di Day or what
Kimberly passes a car  on her right
The driver reaching into the back seat to quiet a   hanging on its head out the window
(unnerved) Jesus, all the crazies are out today
passes Kimberly's head
She smells it and turns around, taking her eyes off the road to see Dano smoking a joint
told you no drugs in the car
My dad will freak
Dano and Frankie exchange looks, God, what a geek
(laughs) Calm down, Kimmy
It's not drugs, just weed
Yeah, you should have specified
Kimberly turns to Shaina, helpless
Shaina spins around, her eyes wordlessly tell Dano,  know she's a priss, but put it out
Then Kimberly's
She hits the speaker button
(
) Kimberly
It's Dad
Hey, Dad
What's up
Dano defiantly blows more smoke toward Kimberly, then breaks into an unexpected coughing fit - looking over to see a   laughing at hi m
The biker's trashy , also laughing, quickly at Dano over: (
) Your car's leaking either transmission or brake fluid want you to have it checked  at a gas station
You got it, Dad
'll call you if have a problem
(
) mean it
Take care of it
will, Dad
Bye, luv you
Kimberly passes a   on her right, the  squinting at a map while driving
mattress and some furniture tied to the top as the wagon hits a bump
Um, Kimberly, your dad's not gonna call like every ten minutes is he
Before Kimberly can answer, Dano sees a  speeding up behind him
He lowers the joint at once
(hiding bag of weed in pants) Shit
There's a cop behind us
Pull into the right lane now
Kimberly, scared, does as she's told nearly colliding with a speeding flat bed semi hauling a huge load of logs
The truck swerves
Then speeds by on the right drops down to the highway
Look first, idiot
Shaina turns up the radio and leans over to Kimberly
Ignore 'em
One end of the   holding the logs in place rattles on the pavement, sparking
Looking in her rearview mirror, Kimberly turns pale - the  pulls in behind her
Dano, put that out
Dano takes one last drag and flicks the joint out the window
It bounces on the windshield of a   to their left

Kat sees the joint that smoulders in the dried leaves beneath her windshield wipers
moment later, a small  crackles
What the hell
No,   not you
Kat flicks on her   , successfully putting out the joint, but her worn wipers smear ash and fluid around, impairing her vision
Kat turns and looks at -- , dead serious all of a sudden
Staring straight ahead
What's the cop doing
Did he see that
Kat sees the tailgating , smiles, then resumes her conversation
Forget it, 'll call him myself
Kat hangs up, then looks down at her cell phone, squints and dials a number
Early 20's, rookie cop, who seems to have missed the entire exchange
Thomas speaks into his radio

How did  get screwed
(
) No biggie
Drake called in sick
Copy that

Thomas tries to sip from a McDonald's coffee cup on the dashboard, but it's
He places it back on the dash
The  of the road make the   slide closer and closer to the edge of the dashboard

Relax, dude
But Kimberly still looks uneasy as her dashboard "Check Engine" light begins flickering

Get ready to smile, five guys per girl

She pounds the steering wheel, furious
What'd the doctor say

Goddamn you, Jorge

Isabella jumps in surprise and, wiping tears from her eyes, rolls up the windows as petals shower the visor of -- , the Harley Rider, who smears the petals (and some squashed bugs) around his visor and drops back
Kimberly falls back into the right lane and looks uneasy as she sees a   guzzling from a flask as it passes the , revealing its side is an ad for
It finally clears frame, revealing a highway billboard that reads, "
" Kimberly reaches back and pulls on her seatbelt in spite of laughter from the back seat
Up ahead, the   seems to have more give to it against it
Suddenly, a black cloud of exhaust from a blue '83 Chevette in front of them causes everyone to roll up their windows
from its rusty exhaust pipe
The thick exhaust Kimberly
Gas it around these idiots
We do have 1200 miles to go, you know
Kimberly tires to enter the passing lane, but she's blocked by a In the front seat, a seven- year old kid is sadistically two toy cars together
Kimberly passes the Suburu and pulls up to a
The Harley roars by, startling her

Tim drums on the dashboard with two ten-ounce Naya bottles
Tim, will you cut that out can't even hear myself think
Tim frowns and then winces, holding his jaw
Damn, it really hurts, Mom
know, we'll be there soon
Tim drops the Naya bottles on the seat
One of them quietly falls to the floor, rolls a bit, finally settling
Kimberly is still behind the smoke-spewing Chevette
She passes it on the left
Frankie rolls down his window
(yells to driver) Ever hear of the Ozone layer, asshole

he looks up to see the Patrol Car is now behind him, he reflexively taps the brakes
Rory, eyes like saucers, sits rigidly transfixed at the wheel and nonchalantly wipes the  clean on his pants
She has dropped back behind the Chevette and  car and is running down along side of a
Up ahead she sees the Hig hway Patrol Car flick on its  and pull into the shoulder around the Chevette and behind the Semi loaded with logs
As Thomas pulls in behind the log truck, his coffee cup lurches forward, spilling hot coffee all over his lap and the floor
Son of a bitch
Its driver,  , 21, flashes a cocky smile at Kimberly, clearly making Frankie jealous
Trans Am
That shit went out with New Kids on the Block
Yeah
Who does he think he is
Knight Rider
(laughs; then) Who
Frankie leans out and tosses milkshake on Evan's window
You know, Hasselhoff before he did Baywatch
Evan, pissed off, flips off Frankie
The windshield wipers smear around the thick milky fluid
The sun blinding him
What's the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to Daytona
How does a nice mature fuck sound
Kimberly laughs, then leans in close to Shaina
Hey, thanks for talking    me into this trip
Ever since     my mom dunno,  just feel like    'm starting to live again,    you know
Shaina smiles in understanding
Thomas bends to wipe up the mess
He only glances at the road as he tries to soak up the coffee
Suddenly up ahead,
The logs roll off the side of the truck onto the highway
One bounces as it hits, and slams through Thomas' front winshield and out the back, taking Thomas' head with it
slams on his brakes
His Harley slides out and he is to the ground, sliding at 60 miles per hour across the highway, right in front of the yellow mini-bus
The -   brakes to avoid Eugene
The tumble forward and hit him in the head
He loses control and slides off the road onto the grass median
He blows a front tire and the mini-bus begins to flip, several times int o the oncoming lanes of traffic, and is  by a Eugene slides into a huge log, and hits it with a sickening crunch
Only to be  and  by his sliding motorcycle
Rory looks up too late and   Thomas' car,  the gas tank and  Rory's dead body halfway through the windshield where it remains half in/half onto the hood
, dialing, looks up, slams on her brakes, but  on oil from the Chevette
She swerves into Kimberly,   her, then swerves to miss a huge log -- only to run head on into two more, flipping the Expedition end over end right next to Kimberly
Kimberly swerves back from being hit by Kat, just in time to see a huge log ahead
She tries to turn hard to the right to avoid it, but hits it broadside -- Sending the    the top of the log and  down the road
Inside, Shaina, Dano and Frankie are tossed around like rag dolls, shredded by glass and shrapnel -- Frankie is  out the side window
Kimberly's  slides to a stop on its side
She looks back to her mangled but still alive friends and up in time to see ' Nora sees the collisions ahead and slams on the brakes but the fallen Naya bottle prevents her from braking, and she  into the back of Kat's Expedition
The crash test dummy collision folds her Pacer and it  into a huge fireball

He swerves his Trans Am around the burning cars onto the wet grass
Kimberly sees the topless Trans Am slowly roll out of a huge and coast to a stop
Evan comes up battered and bloody but still alive
He is trapped in his burning car, screaming and trying to release the seatbelt
Then, just when she thought it was over, a   slides thro ugh the wall of fire,  the Trans Am out of the way,  it like a top
With the back sliding at 90 degrees it keeps on coming
' The semi's grill comes right at her
She screams and we -- : -   - 8 Sweating profusely, Kimberly's eyes dart around, taking in her surroundings

The drivers behind them start leaning on their horns
Kimberly leans out the window and sees the Chevette, the Pacer, The White Van, the Trans Am, the Harley
all the familiar vehicles from the pile up
She turns on the radio, frantically scans the dial
Relax, you need to chill the fuck out
Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell
For Christ sakes girl, take a breath

The opening guitar riff to    blares from the speakers

Kimberly, shaking like a leaf, pulls the  forwards, turning it sideways to block off all traffic
What the hell are you doing
Dano shifts in his seat and sees - a Highway Pat rol Car ominously cruising up the shoulder of the onramp
He shoves a bag of weed, along with the joint, down his pants
Five-'s coming
Let's fucking roll, man
Officer Thomas Burke stops the car behind them
Jesus Christ
Here he comes
Move
No
We'll all die if we do
The cop turns on his
told you she'd ruin everything
Shut up, Dano, just stay cool
(to Kimberly) He's just stoned
Officer Thomas Burke exits his car and approaches the passenger side of the , hand on weapon
Thomas taps the window with his knuckle
What's going on here
(incoherent, through tears) There's going to be a pile up
Logs
Bodies everywhere
saw it happen
It happened
Thomas looks to the guys in back who shrug, "we don't know her
" Miss, please step out of the vehicle
As she does, Thomas discretely unsnaps his holster
nervously eyes the action
Sneaks a paper bundle into his sock
, the pregnant woman in the White Van, gets out
She gives Thomas her friendliest smile, milking the pregnant belly
Excuse me, but is there some way we could just drive around
have a delivery
Her    and she leans back inside to answer it
Hey hon, you got a mysterious caller on the answering machine from Planned Parenthood
What's going on
As she listens, growing agitated, the Harley Rider dismounts and pulls off his helmet
Revealing  , 35, a nebbishy school teacher in cool leathers
watches the , distressed
What on Earth are they doing
(picking up two Naya bottles) Who am , David Blane
Nora gives Tim a hard stare, then they both break into smiles
Nora tousles his hair
And doesn't stop
(good-natured laughter) Okay, quit it already
As he laughs, something pains his jaw and he winces
isn't quite sure what kind of insanity he's dealing with yet
Dano and Frankie, no help, stare dead ahead
(trying to calm herself) The radio played the same songs, the old lady's bag broke the exact same way it did in my premonition
Kimberly erupts into a panic when she sees the   speed past
She grabs at Thomas for emphasis
's the truck that's going to kill everyone
Alright miss, calm down
just need this lane open
need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder
You're not listening to me
You have to do something
impatiently yells out the window of his
Arrest this whack-job, wouldja
Some of us have lives, y'know
Kimberly looks to Shaina for support, but even Shaina can't meet her eyes
Why won't anyone listen to me
Thomas, subtly reaching for his cuffs
'm not going to tell you to calm down again -- In the distance
It's neverending
Horrific
Kimberly's face crumbles
She screams in horror and collapses against the
Thomas runs to his patrol car
The White Delivery Van makes a - turn out of the line of cars and down the onramp in reverse, Isabella screaming angrily into her cell phone
You couldn't keep your dick in check for a month
The other drivers exit their cars, craning their necks to see what's happened up ahead
Kat takes a deep drag off her smoke
Great, now 'm really gonna be late
Thomas barks into the radio handset -- 51,  need assistance and requesting paramedics for a major At -- Frankie watches the traffic start to back up as a couple of passing cars
Shaina anxiously watches Kimberly pacing behind the Kimberly, what's going on
Kimberly moves toward Shaina's window
As she leans her head into Shaina's window, an ominous  blows back their hair and we hear the   of a
And Kimberly is unexpectedly yanked backward by Thomas
From nowhere, a  of  as a -  plow s the across the frame
Flying debris misses Kimberly and Thomas by inches
Kimberly cries in horror into Thomas' shoulder as her friends burn up in the wreckage
- - Evan, the driver of the Trans Am, impatiently speaks to , late 40s, professional with an open face that makes him a great listener
don't know what you want from me
Some crazy chic k blocks the highway with her car, said there'd be an accident and there was
Big deal
Even a broken watch is right twice a day
Officer Thomas Burke passes by, heading into -- - Kat, Eugene, Nora, Tim, and Rory sit in a large room, waiting to give statements
Unlike Evan, these witnesses are clearly distraught
Not to sound insensitive, but how much longer is this going to take
If  don't get back to my classroom soon, the kids'll tear the room apart
Those poor people
To think it would've been us if not for
She's still in shock, her mind far away
Thomas sits close to her, speaking softly
Tell me again how it started
Like  said, it was like  was there
remember everything
The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face
Do you remember what triggered it all
The log truck
and everybody guess
Everyone was driving like a maniac
And somehow  knew something horrible was going to happen, even before it did
Something clicks for Thomas, but he forces himself to speak calmly, like a lawyer leading a friendly witness
You knew
You just mean a hunch, right
bad vibe, maybe
The other drivers stare at Kimberly
More than that
All the songs on the radio were about car crashes
Some kid's banging toy cars together
(lookin g at her) She was dialing her cell phone with her headset on
(points to Rory) His car was leaking oil all over the road
Hey, don't be knockin' the Chevette
But the others listen intently now
Especially Kat, who spies her headset buried deep in her purse
Billboards about accidents
Kids yelling "pile up" for no reason
It all felt
just wrong
Just like
(swallows; hesitates) Like what
Kimberly sighs and looks down
The room becomes eerily silent, except for the  of a florescent light
know this sounds crazy
but you all heard about Flight 180, right
The kid who got off the plane
Thomas' eyes widen -- then a startling  as Rory, le aning back in his chair, tips over
Thomas rolls his eyes as Rory grins sheepishly and picks himself up
You mean Alex Browning
(looking down) My Premonition was just like his
What are you talking about
(sarcastic) Oh, you must have read about that kid who had a dream about a plane crash so he got his buddies off the plane
Then the thing blew up just like in the dream
Maybe
Eugene sees Nora and Tim are hooked and speaks in scary campfire tones
But this is where it starts to get freaky
So a month goes by, everything seems cool, but then the survivors start dying one boy one
'Cause when your number's up, it's up, right
Some people said Death itself started coming for them, hunting down every last one, until they were all dead
Everyone tenses up
Well, not quite all of them
Clear Rivers checked herself into a padded room at Stoneybrook
Kimberly, affected, looks to Thomas for confirmation
You do believe me, don't you
Everyone jumps as Detective Suby pounds on the door and opens it
Officer Burke
Could  see you in here
- The
Detective Suby enters, leading Thomas
Through a two - way mirror, they can see the others chatting anxiously
Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again
(beat) Did you
Of course not
That would be irresponsible and unprofessional
Detective Suby's persistent glare makes Thomas uncomfortable
Look, you weren't there
It was weird
She knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident, she knew
(beat) Never mind
thought we we re finished with this bullshit
This is police work, not the psychic Hot Line
But Thomas isn't listening
He's glued to Kimberly's words
When Detective Suby realizes this, he stops and listens
But if  was never meant to pull over, then we all should have died in the pile up
Which means Death could be coming for us
Detective Suby looks pissed o ff
Way to console the witnesses Burke
At the same time, we watch Evan enter the other room, grab his jacket and wave goodbye to the others
You got 'em thinking Death is after them
Shit, they're the luckiest sons o' bitches on the planet
Get this guy Evan Shaeffer; Yesterday the kid wins the lotto and today some looney bitch b locks traffic and he avoids the worst pile up in years
should be so damn unlucky
- Kimberly, Nora, Tim, Kat, Eugene and Rory now seem affected by what they've heard
What if it's true
What if it's happening all over again
The fluorescent light above  ominously
Nora, disturbed, stands up in a huff, grabbing Tim's arm
You're all certifiable, you know that
can't believe 've been listening to this crap
Come on, Tim, let's go outside
Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'
Look lady, we're just yankin' your chain
Yeah, you're acting like we all just got the Diff'rent Strokes curse or something
Eugene and Rory burst out laughin g
Nora shakes her head, disgusted
What's wrong with you people
Nora pulls a reluctant Tim out of the room
As she opens the door, the others watch Detective Suby and Thomas appear from nowhere to calm her down
When the door swings shut, an awkward silence
Suddenly, the door opens again and Thomas leads Mr
Burroughs inside
Mr
Burroughs sees Kimberly and chokes back tears
Kimberly
The sight of her fath er crying is enough to make Kimberly's own dam burst
She rushes over to him and buries her head in his chest, sobbing
Can  take her home
Thomas nods
Sure, you can all go
By now, the fluorescent light flickers out of control
When Rory, Kat and Eugene stand up, Thomas looks helpless
First 'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense
Yeah,  hate to love and leave ya, but 've been over this -Files shit since the sixth season
As Thomas watches them file out, the fluorescent light
Then - Kimberly sits at the table
Mr
Burroughs sets down a cup of tea before her
Both are shaken
know it's crazy, but 'm really scared for the others
've got this terrible feeling
What feeling
That it's not over yet
She picks up the tea, it clatters in her trembling hands
Don 't worry
Everything will be fine, you'll see
'  - dingy singly light bulb illuminates the narrow stairwell
Evan appears in the darkness, carrying a brand new television with some packages on top
He's unable to s ee the long rickety stairwell he climbs
The stairs are littered with Chinese take out  and a apparently left by some kids
As Evan slowly climbs the staircase, a   comes down, forcing Evan to lean against - - which  and
After the   passes, Evan slowly continues up again,    on a nail
Motherfucker
The air blows a   slowly toward the center of the staircase, directly in Evan's path - but Evan just misses it
He continues past  , nearing the top stair - The Airduct coughs, sending menus fluttering toward Evan's feet and he slips on them
He juggles the  - but ultimately rights himself and continues down the hallway
'  - Dim, cheap, probably roach-infested
As Evan enters, the small packages fall off the  box and onto the floor
Evan places the  by the door, looks at his torn shirt, but fuck it, who cares; he's on a natural high
He peels his shirt off, revealing his  , flicks on the radio and  his way over to the fridge and grabs a drink
In the tiny kitchenette area, a small swarm of flies hovers over a grease-filled frying pan
Evan recoils, throws open the window and throws the grease to the sidewalk five stories below
An ominous  enters -- And a kitchen cabinet slowly
Some  and  slide forward on poorly stacked plates
Daring to fall into the toaster
Evan spills some cooking oil on the range while pouring it into the frying pan, then dumps in some frozen mozzarella sticks
Evan puts the frying pan on the stove and turns it on
He then grabs a container of   and rests it on the counter next to the fridge
On the fridge, several colorful  spell out on the  - which mysteriously drops into the Chinese food - the word   remaining
Oblivious, Evan puts the food in the microwave and turns it on
The cooki ng oil creeps toward the range
Evan hits  on his answering machine and rushes across the room to tear open his packages
(
) Dude
You suck
You buy one fucking ticket in your whole life and win twenty grand
We're going whoring in Prague, you know this
(whisper) Hold on, the boss is coming
, then hold : /'s

It pops and fizzles
And ugly sound
As many similar messages continue, Evan unwraps a new
He slides it over his wrist, admiring it
Lazily sliding off the shelf and into the toaster, protruding about an inch and a half
Hardly noticeable
By now, Evan has opened the next package; a gaudy gold and diamond encrusted horseshoe ring
He carries the ring into the kitchenette, sees the Chinese food is , and his hands flash out to turn it off -- from the microwave startles him

Evan reaches   , his fingers searching for the ring

No use
As the slowly spreads to nearby cereal boxes, Evan starts to panic
He continues yanking

Slightly out of his grasp
But his fingertips are just long enough to knock the bottle backwards - where it rests against

And the Palmolive lazily falls, resting on the remaining switch

When the  goes through Evan's body, his other hand jerks out, knocking the flaming frying pan to the floor
The entire kitchen is in flames, including the new  blocking the door
The window slams
The room fills with smoke
Jesus Christ
Evan grabs a fire extinguisher
mere dribble of foam comes out
He begins  in the smoke
Evan tries the window -
He has no choice but to smash the kitchenette window with the fire extinguisher to get to the fire escape
He dr ops the fire extinguisher, starts to climb out the window, hears a creak and looks up just as -- large jagged shard of glass comes  down at him -- Evan jumps back just in time as it shatters before him
The fire completely engulfs the kitchen
He bravely jumps through the window pane, landing on the fire escape
He runs down the fire escape from floor to floor
from his window showers him with glass and brick shrapnel, but ultimately, he makes it to the fire escape's lowest level, intact
He tries to lower the rusty metal ladder to the ground
It budges once, then twice, but won't go down
So he climbs over the railing and gently drops to the ground
Safe and sound, he breathes a sigh of relief and turns to walk -- he s lips on the very grease he threw out the window, his legs shoot out from under him and he lands on his back
The rusty ladder suddenly dislodges and hurls downward -- coming right for Evan's face -- but stops halfway
As Evan laughs, breathing a final sigh of relief, it suddenly again -- impaling Evan through his eye socket
-   - Thomas sits at the computer terminal
He checks to make sure no one's watching as he enters a  for Alex Browning
Ten websites come up, all devoted to the Flight 180 Curse
Thomas scrolls around, seeing the death pix and autopsy photos of Flight 180 "survivors"
Headlines blare, "Freak Accident
" "Bizarre Coincidence

As Thomas begins a localized search of the word, "" -- from behind him
Thomas whirls around to see Det
Suby looking over his shoulder, humming the music from an old monster movie
Suby presses one hand to his forehead, the other polishing an apple against his vest
(as if entranced) Ooooh,  see it now
Your future
transfer to another department
Suby bites the apple, casually offering nothing more
Thomas, embarrassed, flicks off the computer, stands
You've made your point
Good
Cause we just got some new info and  don't ne ed you getting freaky on me
What
Evan Shaeffer's dead
Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought
Detective Suby shrugs and walks away, munching the apple
Thomas looks stunned
'  - Kat cradles a phone to her shoulder
She watches television and crushes Oreos into a bowl of ice- cream
No, Mom
Just turn on any station, they've been playing it all day
(beat; rolls her eyes) Yes, Mother

Eugene, however, shakes his head sadly but goes back to grading blue books

Nora swallows, trying to seem brave
Oh, please
Some people just need some serious rewiring, that's all
But neither of them are convinced
Get some sleep
Nora kisses his forehead and leaves the room
After she leaves, Tim opens his nightstand drawer, pulls out a dusty nightlight and plugs it in

And locks it
She nervously checks the closet and even lowers the blinds
Finally, she takes out a business card and dials a number
She hangs up, then dials again

Goodnight
But Mr
Burroughs isn't ready to leave
He finishes his drink

Kimberly tenses, bracing for the worst
There were so many times  didn't think  could last another day can't even tell you some of the things  th ought about
used to have those feelings, too
But that's when 'd think of Mom
Her strength
and courage
And 'd pray that maybe 'd grow up to be as brave as she was

Mr
Burroughs stands frozen, tensing for the inevitable crunch

And he leaves
: '  - The room is dark except for one burning candle
Kimberly tosses and turns
The wind sends a single branch scraping against her window porch swing  back and forth
Adding to her anxiety
, sputtering out the candle
Kimberly sits upright in bed and sees the
Huh
She lights a match and sees the candle wax dripped onto her table, forming the gooey shape of a
180
The match goes out in her hand
The room is dark again
Headlights fr om passing cars cast eerie shadows on her ceiling
Shadows resembling  seem to transform into a
Kimberly, freaked out, looks around to see the blinking light from the : it flashes 18:0 a few times, then 12:00
She can't take it anymore
She yanks the  cord from the wall and flicks on the lights, ridding the room of shadows
And anxiously turns on her computer
- Kimberly drives a beat up Hyundai through an eerie morning mist that surrounds the grounds of the Stoneybrook Hospital

As Kimberly drives through the gate, the mist almost seems to follow her inside

" Kimberly drives to the mental ward
- in a lab coat leads a nervous Kimberly down the center of a long corridor
The Physician consults a clipboard
at the request of the patient, you are to relinquish any sharp objects such as nail files, pencils, pens, safety pins, bobby pins, no matches, lighters, belts, belt buckles, earrings, chokers, shoelaces
Kimberly watches carefully as the Physician comes to a door and punches "4514" into the electronic lock
They continue down another corridor
Lights flicker,patients cackle and moan in the
paper clips, watches, food, drinks, keys, poisons, pills and medications
(looks at Kimberly) You have a cell phone on you
Kimberly nods, hands it over
Then  think we're all done
They arrive at a door to a padded room
The Physician punches in another code
Wait
Is she
dangerous or something
No honey, but she expects you are
Jesus, how long are you going to keep her locked up this way
Depends on her,  guess
She's voluntary
The door hisses open
'   - While still beautiful, this young woman bears few traces of her former self
Her eyes dart around suspiciously, maddened by chronic paranoia
Her hair is patchy, her eyes dark and haunted
Bordering on savage
Her movements are fidgety, erratic, always distracted by something unseen
Clear Rivers
Clear looks Kimberly up and down and steps back, allowing her inside her inner sanctum
mattress on the floor, a plastic bottle of water, some paperbacks and a bedpan
Kimberly's jaw drops when she sees the far wall: a  to flight 180
The wall is papered with art icles about all the survivors (as seen in the opening title montage)
The door
Kimberly jumps
Kimberly Burroughs, eh
What do you want
thought
thought you might be able to help me
(snicker) Yeah, how
had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up
saved some people
And now  think Death is after me
Nice work
Maybe if you're real lucky, you'll wind up in here with me
(gives Kimberly the once over) But  doubt you'll survive that long
Kimberly flinches
It's not just about me
Someone saved died last night in a freak accident
What if the others are in danger, too
Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up
What list
Death's list
The precise order you're going to die in
Clear's eyes bore into a terrified Kimberly's
The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash
That was Death's original design
(sudden realization) Exact order
Then 'm next
was meant to die with my friends, so 'm next
Clear backs away from Kimberly as if she were lethal, then stops short
But you said someone else died last night
That means Death skipped past you
Someone must have intervened
(off Kimberly's confusion) Sometime yesterday you must have nearly died, but someone saved you
Kimberly nods, recalling the events
Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends
Congratufuckinglations
That makes you last to go
But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you
Always does
That still doesn't make sense
You said you die in the same order you were originally meant to
But Evan Shaeffer died last in my premonition, not first
Clear seems very disturbed by that
It's moving backwards
Are you sure
Kimberly reluctantly strains to remember something
: Nora's Pacer folds like an accordion, then , followed by Evan screaming in the Trans Am, which gets  by the semi
: Kimberly, shaken, does the math
Yes
In my premonition that Nora woman and her kid died first, then Evan and then
my friends
Clear is oblivious when Kimberly breaks into silent sobs
Backwards
that's new
Clear sees Kimberly crying and softens
That's good
Get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes
(off Kimberly's confusion) For the signs
Signs
If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon
When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your- face irony kinda thing
Don't ignore it
It usually means the difference between life and death
(to herself) The songs on the radio
(to Clear) But wait
don't understand
Why is this even happening to me
That's what Alex used to ask himself right up until
For an instant, we see a gentle side of Clear
It's obvious you know what you're talking about
You beat it
You have to help us
Clear suddenly toughens up, an abrupt mood shift
didn't beat it;  hid from it
If you were smart you'd put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the dog, because what little life you have left is over as you know it
Don't make new friends, don't fall in love, and don't ever bother trying to save others
That's the worst killer of them all
How can you say that
What kind of monster are you
At once, Clear, enraged, is in her face, speaking through clenched teeth
My family is dead
My friends are dead
And Alex
Clear angrily peels a Polaroid off the wall and shows it to Kimberly
While we don't see the photo, Kimberly's horrified face paints a gruesome picture on its own
And yes, that's the blade of a fucking ceiling fan in his head
Clear pounds on the door, apparently done with Kimberly opens the door
Kimberly, devastated, turns to leave, then summons her courage and turns back to Clear
Know what
think you're a coward
think you hide out in here because you're too damn bitter and selfish to care about another living soul
In my opinion, you're already dead
Kimberly leaves, giving Clear something to think about
'  - As Kimberly pulls into her driveway, she's surprised to see a parked there
Then -- , wearing street clothes, peers through the front window of the house
He guiltily backs away as Kimberly gets out
tried calling last night but your father -- Evan Shaeffer's dead
Thoma s nods and leans against the large glass windows that reflect the sky behind them
know
've gotten calls all morning from everyone who was on the onramp
We're all meeting at my apartment tonight
Then you believe all this
That Death is working off a list
Thomas hesitates before answering
didn't
Until  was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors
Clean up
don't
Suddenly through the reflection of the window glass, Kimberly sees hundreds of pigeons dive bomb her at once
Like a scene out of  , Kimberly must duck and cover as the pigeons assault her from every angle
But when Kimberly turns away from the reflection, toward the actual pigeons, '
Did you see that
Thomas, concerned for her, saw nothing
Pigeons
It's a sign
If Clear's right about the order, then Nora and Tim are going to be attacke d by Pigeons
'm not following you -- They're next on the list
We have to find them

Reveal Nora taking her son Tim to a dentist's office
The  snags on a bolt of one of the steel side panels, untying it
(mischievous smile) You think the tooth fairy's gonna come tonight
'm thinkin' like fifteen bucks
Nice try, kiddo
Tim smiles, then winces from the pain in his mouth
heads straight for the escalator grate As Tim steps off, Nora  forward
Her caught sneaker is pulled tighter into the innards of the metal staircase
Mom
Tim watches helplessly as Nora reaches down, tug ging at her sneaker, fear mounting
Tim also grabs her sneaker and yanks
Finally, the shoelace , and Nora's free again
You okay
Nora puts on a brave face and begins tying one long shoelace to the stubby one
Sure hon
'm fine
Let's shake it, we're late
Tim nods
The wind picks up as they continue past a -- Who apply industrial suction cups to large, thick sheets of Tim stares in childlike fascination as they pass , a , and an

Lees unveils a tray full of , and
The - of construction outside makes it im possible to concentrate, but, hands trembling slightly, Dr
Lees picks up a pic and mirror and starts examining Tim's mouth

Tim groans "uh-uh", then suddenly flinches
(
) Yeah, that'll have to be filled

Lees

Lees picks up a large  and moves it toward Tim's open mouth
Open big

Tim's eyes radiate fear

Reluctantly
Tim nervously eyes the window as the needle enters

Lees' hand jerks, nearly jabbing Tim's tongue
Tim squirms violently
Dr
Lees looks towards the window angrily
How the hell do they expect me to
Would you rather have the laughing gas
Tim nods his head ferociously
Jean

- Jean continues vacuuming
The vacuum makes contact with Nora's foot
- After a minute, Dr
Lees angrily switches on two compressors: Oxygen and Nitrous Oxide
By now, the  mask has been attached around Tim's nose
As Tim drifts off, Dr
Lees lowers a  into his mouth

The vacuum sparks and dies just as -- ' :   - it sounds like a pigeon finally crashed through the window
In the other room
Goddamn it already
Dr
Lees marches out of the room to investigate
Another quick electrical surge and the   flutters off
The needle drops
But the  flow remains strong
Spinning from a new breeze
Suddenly, a small round directly into Tim's mouth
Soft, gurgling and choking
- Nora stares at a pigeon with a broken wing frantically trying to fly right
Dr
Lees makes a half- hearted attempt to soothe and catch it
' up to Tim
Choking, gurgling
His eyes are open, but rolled up
His hand limply reaches up
then drops
Sounds of commotion in the next room seem to fade away as we continue our   into Tim's eyes

the choking stops
And a  reaches into frame and pulls the puffer fish out of Tim's mouth
looking petrified at the close call, looking around to make sure nobody saw
- Nora and Tim, feeling better now, walk past the smiles at Tim, who smiles back
From across the mall, the tiny running figures of Kimberly and Thomas appear in the dis tance, pointing and screaming
What are they doing here
And why are they yelling "pigeons"
Just then, Tim and Nora walk into a large cluster of  who suddenly burst into flight, startling the Crane Operator, whose hand inadvertently jerks a lever - fills the air and Tim looks up just as a downward toward him and  him, his mangled body visible underneath
As two pearly whites roll around on the sidewalk,
: - Emergency vehicles everywhere
Thomas seems exhausted as he walks back to Kimberly, who stands by his car
In the , EMTs load a stretcher into an ambulance
(shaking his head) Nora's not coming
She refuses to leave her son
We have to tell her she's in danger
(sadly) did
And right now,  don't think she cares
'  - Thomas' car turns into the driveway and parks
Kimberly holds up her hand and watches it tremble
It's happening again
It's fucking happening again
hoped we'd get there and they'd be okay, that Clear Rivers was full of shit and Evan's death was just a freak accident
Thomas kills the engine to listen
But we're all going to die
We can't stop it
It's just a matter of time
'm so scared
Thomas takes her hand and squeeze s it reassuringly
am too
But you can use that fear
It'll sharpen your instincts
Keep you alert fro signs
It's the only way you'll be able to sav e the others
and me
Kimberly, seeming overwhelmed, pulls her hand back
Thomas senses he's losing her, and softens her approach
know you didn't ask for any of this, Kimberly
But  don't think you have it in you to quit either
Kimberly stares straight ahead, the weight of the world sinking in
startling pound on the roof of Thomas' car
Kimberly jumps, then spins around to see: - standing in the driveway
determined, powerful presence
Kimberly exits the car
where Kimberly and Clear stare each other down
Clear/Thomas
Thomas/Clear
Clear nods absently to Thomas, still focused on Kimberly
(bitter) The second one just dies
16 year old kid
(nods; a faint trace of guilt) hope you're ready for this
- Thomas' car pulls into a partially filled parking lot
Kimberly, Thomas and Clear file out and head to the door
This is cheery
Who is this guy, anyway
mortician
He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us
Should we knock
(looking ill) He probably already knows we're coming
- Kimberly, Thomas and Clear open the large wooden doors into a small chapel, creat ing a loud
corpse in an open casket sits at the front of the chapel, post -wake
Kimberly, Thomas and Clear are forced to walk around the dead body to get to a side door
- The three slowly edge towards a room at the end of a creepy hallway
An   flickers from the far room
The unmistakable sounds of a furnace make it all the more eerie
As they near the door, they're able to see inside the room; the shadow of a figure looms against a steel oven
They edge closer
They peek inside the -- Oddly there is no one there
As they enter, passing the furnace, a momentary  of flames startles them all
They jump back - bumping right into: , the dark, sinister mortician from FD1, who has inexplicably appear
Hello, Clear
've been keeping an eye out for you
The mortician rolls a metal gurney carrying ' toward the firing oven
Kimberly and Thomas are scared
Oh my God
That's Evan Shaeffer
Clear, however, seems to expect nothing less
Come to
Pick my brain
The Mortician slides a gleaming set of medical pliers into Evan's mouth
And  out a gold tooth
Kimberly recoils as he discards the bloody tooth on a metal tray
(to Kimberly) Flesh and bone require 1,600 degrees for cremation
Gold, prosthetics and other metals must be removed before the final -- (not falling for this again) Just a simple question and we'll leave you alone with your new friend
The Mortician grins; he likes the new Clear
He crosses the room and hits a
-
The oven begins to blaze
Fire away
How do you cheat Death once and for all
The Mortician, recrossing the room, passes Kimberly and stoops down to sniff, no , a terrified Kimberly's essence
Dead
But still fresh
Kimberly shudders as the Mortician moves back to Evan's body
Clear has had about enough
(to the Mortician) Look, we drove a long way to get here
So if you happen to know how to get this death monkey off our backs, it sure would be swell if you told us
The Mortician now    around Evan's
For what purpose
You seek a back way out of a room with but one door
You can't cheat Death; there are no escapes
Bullshit
You told me Death has a distinct design, a blueprint, unalterable
But Alex and cheated Death not once, but dozens of times
If the design is flawed, it can be beaten
sick smile crosses the Mortician's lips
He yanks the nipple ring Kimberly looks on both horrified and awed when Clear doesn't flinch back from the pliers, where a bloody nub dangles
Such fire in you now
People are always most alive just before they die
Don't you think
Clear steps back from him, hate flashing in her eyes
It can be beaten
And you know it
-
The Mortician rolls Evan's body into the oven
Some say that there is a balance to everything
An equilibrium that is the connective tissue of the universe
They say that for every lif e there is a death, and for every death a life
His words hang in the air
An ominous  enters
Solus novus anima licet evinco mortis; Only new life can defeat death
(off their confusion) The list of life is forever set by the Divine Plan, the guiding hand that plots the course of the universe, down to its tiniest element s
Thomas looks to Clear; what's he talking about
The Mortician focuses on Kimberly as if the others had ceased to exist
The list accounts for every life; from the dawn of man to the great apocalypse
But the introduction of life that was not meant to be, a soul forbidden to roam the earth, that could invalidate Death's list, shatter its very existence
Evan's other eye  , startling Thomas and Kimberly
What the hell does that mean
(with finality) To figure that out you'll have to follow the sign s
The Mortician grabs Kimberly
But be warned
To disrupt the grand design is to unravel the tapestry of the universe
When you pull all the threads apart, you may find yourself hanging from them
The Mortician finally lets Kimberly go
One last question
Why is Death working backwards this time
The Mortician glances at his watch - Evan's bran d new Rolex
(shakes head; a sick smile) Sorry, time's up
- - From the nozzle in Thomas' car
Thomas fills the tank, watching for signs of danger
Clear's hand is poised over the gas pumps' - Some   exit the mini -mart with a pack of Camels, followed by Kimberly, who carries a couple of Red Bulls and hands them out
New life defeats death
Follow the signs
Where the hell did you find that guy
Yeah,  thought he was supposed to be helpful
He was
If we can use your ability to see the signs, we can cheat Death long enough to figure out what "new life" means
(off their looks) know, it worries me that understand him
Thomas tops off the tank
Some gas spills to the ground
Quick looks all around -- sure enough, one of the Skate Rats is about to strike a match
'   the kid in the back of the head, stopping him mid - motion
What the fuck are you thinking
The startled Skate Rat shrinks back from Clear's rage
'm thinkin', suck my junk, bee yatch
Thomas chuckles to himself and looks at Kimberly who -- : - Grease-covered female hands reach out toward a steering wheel of a white van speeding out of control
The van crashes through a railing and  into the water
In moments, the van fills with water, the driver inside trapped
Drowning
Horrible
: - Comes to Thomas' arms -  uncontrollably for breath
Terror- stricken
She begins hyperventilating
What is it
What did you see
It's so bad, Kimberly can't speak
She coughs and gags as if recently drowned
Clear scans the perimeter for immediate dangers
: On a cherry picker messes with the transformer, a   pull- starts a   close to broken glass, a  on a tall ladder changes out the gas price numbers, a female   with three dogs approaches the ladder
You have to tell us now
Clear shakes her head by the shoulders and barks commands like an angry drill sergeant
You're strong
Do you hear me
You're a fucking warrior
Nothing scares you
In fact you happen to be the single most powerful woman on earth
Now what did you see
The words slowly take affect
Kimberly becomes centered, getting her breath back, and speaks without a hitch
was driving a white van
It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and drowned
It was
horrible
You were there
can practically taste the water in my throat
And something else
The smell of flowers
(confused) Then it wasn't just a sign
It was a premonition
Thomas gently releases her, paces
Remember the onramp
There was a pregnant woman in a white delivery van
Holy shit
He said "only new life can defeat death
" (off looks) If she gives birth to a baby that was never meant to be born, a brand new soul that was never part of Death's Design
It throws the entire Death list out of whack
And a new list has to be rewritten f rom scratch
We all start over with a clean slate
It sounds all well and good, but what if we're wrong
Please, what else could it mean
(to Thomas) So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby
So let's do it
(realization) Shit,  don't have her number
She was never interviewed
She took off right after the accident
How are we going to find her
There must be thousands of white vans in this state
Hey, 'm a police officer, remember
/  -   - Thomas works a , scanning  through the video footage from the patrol car camera
We see the 's explosive collision with the jack- knifed semi
Kimberly is taken by surprise by the sight of the crash
Oh God
Thomas sees Kimberly and quickly flicks off the monitor
, uh
sorry
Kimberly notices Clear watching her and toughens up
She forces back the tears and qui ckly wipes the rest away
know,  know
We need my eyes
Clear sits beside Kimberly
It's all right
'll take watch
Kimberly looks grateful, and a moment passes between them, but she's already buried the need to cry
'm okay
Just caught me by surprise
Put it back on
Clear does, watching the cars seemingly pass in reverse
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight
Taken care of
Back, back, back until the Patrol Car slowly creeps backwards down the onramp
There it is
Got it
Thomas hits play and we see footage from the patrol car cruising past the White Van
clean shot of the license plate
Jackpot
As Thomas slides his chair to a data base and types in the plate number, the pause function dislodges, slowly advancing the tape frame by frame
don't get it
Why is everything happening so fast
After Flight 180
month went by before anyone died
And now five people are dead in less than a day
Thomas' computer screen finally fills with information
Here we go
The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz
And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two
We need to hurry
They all get up and leave
Ominously,   shows the   creeping behind Nora's Pacer - a white van
- Thomas pulls up to an upper-middle class house
Thomas, Kimberly and Clear get out and start up the unlit path
It's dark, hard to see where they're going, so they negotiate by feeling the bushes aligning the walkway
Let's lay this on her gently now
The stress alone could upset the pregnancy
Kimberly nods, ever creeping closer to the front door -- when from over the garage
All three freeze for a moment, during which we hear  emanate from within the house, and the lights
But nothing else happens
No one comes to a door
Thomas sighs, and as if suddenly remembering his status, he walks fearlessly and purposefully to the front door
He makes a fist, is about to knock - when the    and a for his throat - only to have its collar snagged at the last second by its owner - , late 30's, handsome, cocky
He speaks above Rotty's : What
'm Officer Burke
'm looking for an Isabella Cruz
Suddenly, with an unexpected fury, Jorge  at his dog
Shut up
The Rottweiler cowers, and Jorge shoves it to the floor, where it lands on its feet and fearfully trots away
Jorge's face is once again pleasant, but it's a thin veneer
Jorge sees Clear and Kimberly behind Thomas and frowns
Are you Jorge Cruz
Maybe
What's this about
May we come in
No
What's this about
- eyeing what appears to be    on the tile floor
She takes in what she can see of -- As if a tornado had hit it
Wedding photos smashed and torn
Furniture over-turned
(a little stern) It's about your wife, Isabella
Now is she here
Jorge's eyes flicker ever -so- involuntarily behind him
No
'm alone
But by now, Thomas has seen everything Clear has and more
He stares through the house, into a bedroom and sees - lying half0buried under the bedspr ead
Look, pal, it's probably nothing
But  need to see -- Jorge is already closing the door
Forget it
You'll need a warrant
know, 'm a lawyer
Clear rushes the door, shoulders it and expertly wriggles past Jorge's grasp
Stop
You can't go in there
Clear tears into the bedroom, grabs the bedspread and  it to the floor to reveal a  , naked, trembling with fear, takes a closer look at Clear
We never meant to hurt you Isa
You're not Isabella
Meanwhile, Jorge yells at Thomas
'm going to sue your ass
Whose blood is that on the floor
Defensively, Jorge holds up his arm
Freshly cut
Mine, you idiot
The dog went nuts this afternoon
Now arrest her
Where's Isabella
Did you finally kill her you fucking wife beater
Jorge flinches
It's time to come clean
We had a fight
Some things got broken, the dog went crazy, she left me
Wouldn't say where she was going
What was the fight about
Take a guess
Does she have a cell phone
way we can contact her
She did
He eyes a    on the floor
We're wasting time with this piece of shit
Let's just get to the meeting
Jorge turns to soothe the frightened Young Woman in the bed
Hey, when you find her, tell her the kid's half mine
Clear mutters something as they exit the house
We can only pray it doesn't come out retarded
Jorge hisses something at the Rotty, which  them and
But Thomas slams the door on the frothing dog just in time
: '   - Rory sits in his Chevette outside an apartment building, staring up at the address
He quickly snorts some powder off his key and wipes his nostrils free of crystals
He takes a breath and exits the car
'   - Rory follows some  into the elevator
The elevator doors close on his shoe -- trapping Rory in an awkward position
One  frantically pushes the   button to no avail
Finally, as the elevator rises, Rory  his foot free
Jesus Christ
wrote to management two weeks ago about these friggin' bumpers
Rory bends down and inspects his shoe
Damn, is that dogshit
Rory briefly holds the shoe too close to the Man's face - see
- before disgustedly slipping it back on
The doors open
The man hurries out and the elevator on Rory's smirking face
: '  - - Nora, Rory, and Kat, mortified, sit on a couch
It's obvious the bomb's been dropped, reality has set in
Clear and Kimberly await their reactions
Nora raises a trembling hand
Does anybody have a Valium
Kat opens her purse and hands her a blue pill
You'll want to take -- Nora pops it in her mouth
-- half of that
Nora chews, her eyes half dead from bereavement
Across the loft, Thomas paces, phone in hand
(quietly, into phone) Any word yet on the Dodge van
Damn
Eugene alone seems unafraid
He uses a  - a long pole with movable claw on the end - to
When done, he balances the long pole precariously against the wall
An   enters
Clear notices   blowing over the desk by the couch
So that would mean
'm next
Nobody's next
This is crazy
First death's stalking us and now premonitions
This can't be happening
My career's at a peak,  finally met a cute guy,  just bought a new house
Just shut the fuck up and maybe you'll live
Kat's hands ball into fists
The hatred is mutual
Clear reaches for a nearby cardboard box on the desk, noticing   blowing over until their weight tips over a   which spills pens out
She takes the box to Nora
You're not next, Nora
Nobody has to be next
That's the point
Last time, we didn't plan
We weren't organized
Now we can help each other
She reaches into the box and passes out cell phones to Nora and the others
Think what would have happened if Kimberly had been able to warn you with the word pigeons
Nora's head falls
Kimberly senses her anguish and takes over
The point is, as long as you know what to beware of, you have a fighting chance
It can be beaten
If  call you and say subway, get to a high rise fast
place where no subway could possibly go, get it
Everyone nods in understanding
Rory fidgets, sniffling, then the table in frustration
Startling Kat
Why the hell did  ever get on Route 18 in the first place
That's me, Mr
Dumb Fucking Luck
Clear, very alert, looks at the tipped toward the end of the desk, toward a large White Pages directory which hangs precariously off the edge just so
Anyone read today's paper
The article on Evan Shaeffer
No one says a word
The only reason he was on Route 18 was because he own the lottery and had to collect the winnings
That lucky bastard
What about the rest of you
Kimberly, you were driving to Daytona
Was Route 18 your first choice
The new freeway was faster, but Route 18 was the way my mom used to take, so
They take turns going around the room
Route 18 is Drake's assignment, but he called in sick so  got
(blanches) Drake's never sick
was my first day of jury duty
Jury duty
That's randomly selected by social security numbers
Random, sure
What, you think Death planned for each of us to die in the pile up weeks ago
You're nuts
Clear fumes
Rory looks ill and reaches into his wallet
Last July  dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident
They asked me what number means "good luck" in Jewish
Eighteen
And it's "Hebrew"
Anyway,  guessed it right and won these
Rory holds up two Yankee tickets
The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18
don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance
(realization) Whoa, nine months
Are you thinking what 'm thinking

she's lying down, binging on take- out food, while speaking on the motel phone
disturbing metallic   - can be heard, nearly drowning out the   next door
Yes, 'd like to report a domestic squabble - my name
Isabella Cruz why, does it matter
'm at the Super 8 motel
Yes,  own a white van
So what
Just get over here
Isabella hangs up, recoiling at   against her wall the source of the unsettling  is a rickety, wobbling
'  - Kimberly whispers into the phone
'm sorry, Dad, we're having a hard time with Shaina's eulogy
'll stay here at Virginia's tonight and see you tomorrow
love you too
She hangs up, looking guilty for having lied to her father
Clear keeps her eyes on the pens that  on the slightly canted table into the about-to -fall White Pages directory
Remember everyone, just because Kimberly's got the power doesn't mean we're not all capable of seeing signs to some extent
The pens softly tap the phone book one by one until it lazily tips over and   onto a -
Small feathers from the pillow are carried upwards by the breeze
Everyone in the room watches them rise
It's like Forrest Gump
They float across the room, ultimately landing on a
The trap flies over and knocks into the base of the unstable Grabber - which tips and slowly slides down the wall
Clear, in a chair, looks directly above her head at a mounted on the wall
The Grabber picks up speed, arcs downward and hits the mounted The supporting brackets give, causing the and
Clear lurches back in her chair just in time - the razor sharp bill impales the seat cushion between her legs
Fuck
Should have seen that coming
The institution's made me soft
Clear gets up, carefully easing herself around the swordfish
Eugene isn't quite sure what to make of what he's just seen
If Death has got such a hard-on for you, maybe you should get the hell away from us
We need her
She's the only one who's dealt with this before, idiot
Kimberly looks self-conscious by her outburst
Clear, however, looks grateful
We're all going to have to open our eyes from now on
Look out for each other
Sleep in shifts
(looks around apartment) And we've got to safeproof this deathtrap
- Everyone but Nora and Eugene helps unplug appliances, put out the fire, take down hanging objects, switch off the gas, put sharp objects away, affix padding to chart corners
Kat, placing poisonous cleansers and flammable liquids in a box, nervously pulls out a pack of smokes
Thomas watches as he takes a hanging mirror off the wall
Screw this
'm going outside for a smoke
You think you should
It's not safe out there
So
Nora's gotta bite it before me anyway, right
Kat steps towards the front door, then remembers the cell phone and grabs it just in case
Thomas smiles 'good job' at her
Kimberly, unscrewing the light bulb, looks up when Nora rises from the couch in a stupor and struggles to put on her jacket
Kimberly looks concerned
Where are you going, Nora
You okay
Nora fights the sleeve, dazed and defeated
Four years ago my husband died
Now Tim
There's nothing left for me
Kimberly stops pouring liquor down the drain
Don't say that
Once you lose hope, it's already too late
Eugene snickers
Nora looks up, anger surfacing
If it's my time to go, to be in heaven with my family, then  can accept that
You can't give up
Don't accept Death's plan
Trust me, you can fight this
If we can just survive long enough until that baby is born, we can -- Nora looks more resolute than ever
If you'll excuse me,  have a funeral to prepare
Everyone looks crushed when Nora heads for the door
Except Eugene, who stands up as well
Yeah, why am  listening to a girl who just got out of the nut house
As Eugene heads out, Kimberly becomes enraged and grabs him
Seeing you die once was enough for me
Whatever
control my life, not fate
'll be sure to put that on your tombstone
Rory presses a cell phone into Eugene's hand on his way out
Be careful
And even if you don't believe, give this to Nora
'   - Eugene pushes the elevator button a thousand times
Nora nervously ties her long hair back in a single braid
'  - The nervous group finishes safe-proofing the apartment
, standing on the couch, pulls a    off the wall - and slips - stumbling  into the closet
Staggering, he accidentally knocks some   and a from the high shelf to the floor
Thomas whips around and sees that Rory's not hurt
He then lowers his gaze and sees -- The figurine of a   is framed by a tangled jumble of wire
Suddenly,    for the evening
Oddly, it only illuminates the Trophy/Hangar array
From Rory's vantage point, it looks like a surreal sculpture of a man with hooks emanating from his body
The sodium vapor lamp casts an around the image
man with hooks
see a man with hooks
Someone
The others look over, trying to see what he does
(unsure) kinda see it, yeah
So
Nora's going to be killed by a man with hooks
Kimberly and Clear stare at the volleyball trophy - the street lamp ominously
Everyone looks around for a hesitant beat, then Thomas picks up his cell phone
Clear first walks, then  out the door
'   - The elevator finally comes
Eugene and Nora get inside, standing in front of a gaunt looking man holding a cardboard box full of plays /'s
Going down, right
The Gaunt Man says nothing
The
- Eugene stares blankly at the   in the upper corner
He's disturbed by the   : leans closer to Nora's hair and as the doors finally close, he leans over and  it
Creepy
Um, by the way, your shoe's untied
Nora bends down to tie her shoelace (the one that snapped)
She tries tying the long dangling shoelace to the stubby one as Eugene's cell phone  in his hand
Startled, he drops it to the floor
Then looks embarrassed
Probably for you, anyway
Nora picks it up
It's hard to make out Thomas' yelling
Officer Burke
can't hear
beat of confusion, then she slowly turns to see the clawed hooks and hands of the Prosthetic limbs
Terror
She freezes
What is it
What's wrong
But Nora's too frightened to speak
Eugene grabs the phone, hearing unintelligible
As she frantically hits the elevator button
When it fails to come, she runs downstairs
- Nora slowly rises to her feet, feverishly mouthing a prayer
As the door opens, Nora rushes out - unseen to her, her long braid gets snagged on one of the  ,  her backwards
Let me go let me go
Oh, watch it, you've caught your uh
The Guant Man's sweet voice and demeanor are a clear contrast to his outward appearance
Goodness gracious, darling, let me help you with
Nora panic,s as Eugene and the Man try to untangle her braid
Nora desperately spins her body around, sticking her head back inside the elevator
Kat appears in the lobby, smoking a cigarette
You alright, Nora
The elevator  begin to close, and  around Nora's neck, her head inside, body outside the elevator
Eugene pounds on the , but they don't seem to work
My God, someone please let me out of this -- The   is lit
Clear rushes to the lobby
The Elevator
, Eugene watches Nora's head drop to floor level - then he pounds the Emergency Button - which
Nora's body lifts upwards from the force of the elevator floor
Nora's screams of terror and agony fill the air as the elevator repeatedly
Kat gasps in horror to see this poor woman suspended above the floor
It lurches
And lurches
And lurches
The horror never ends
Clear comes from the stairwell and is shocked by the sight
She runs to the elevator doors, trying to pry them apart to no avail
All Kat can do, crying, is grab hold of Nora's flailing legs and try to pull her back down
The elevator lurches a final time
'   fall down into Kat's arms, knocking her to the floor
Kat freaks, skittering away as the body convulses
Eugene balls his hands to his mouth in undeniable fear bloodcurdling moan escapes him
He stares transfixed as Nora's head, still aghast in terror, rolls around the floor
The sight clearly sends Eugene over the edge
He , , desperate to escape the elevator
'  - Eugene suddenly bursts through the door, babbling incoherently
Kimberly, Thomas and Rory look on, bewildered
no escapes my ass
control my fate
die on my terms, hear me Reaper cockscuker
Eugene's in another world
He approaches Thomas and lunges for his - yanking it from the holster
What the hell are you
Ain't going out like that
On my terms
Just take it easy
twisted insane smile comes to Eugene's face as he jams the gunbarrel to his temple
The others shrink back in terror
He
Eugene tries again
Thomas looks stunned as Eugene goes through every round, Kimberly breaths a sigh of relief
You don't keep it loaded
Thomas' eyes disagree
He reaches in and  the gun away from Eugene, who stands there trembling
Thomas cracks open the cylinder
Loaded
Maybe they were all duds
Six in a row
Never
Impossible
That's like (sinking realization) winning the lottery
(
) It wasn't his turn to die
Everyone turns to see Clear and Kat, standing in the doorway, Kat trembles uncontrollably
Can we find the pregnant woman, please
: '  - Flashing lights from rescue vehicles illuminate the living room
In the newly conformed safe house, Kat and Clear relax as best they can in Thomas' dry clothes
Thomas makes another phone call
In the corner, Eugene shivers to himself
Desperately looking for signs of danger
He looks over to Clear
Um, Clear
'm sorry
about before
Your entire world view just went out the window
couldn't expect a religious conversation overnight
We'll get through this
(beat) promise
Eugene looks immensely relieved
Rory ambles over to Kimberly, his typical callousness gone
Can  ask you a question
Sure
When  die
Is it gonna hurt
don't know
Rory nods
He expected as much
He fishes his  and  out of his pocket
And you're gonna die after me, right
guess so
(re: keys and license) Would you take these
And if die
(tears well up) Could you throw all my drugs out
Paraphernalia, porno, you know
Anything that would break my mom's heart
Kimberly looks deeply into his eyes, looking for the punchline
When she doesn't see one, she nods tenderly and takes the keys
The
Rory jumps at the sound, paranoid eyes in scan mode
Thomas answers, speaks softly, hangs up
one very pissed off Ms
Isabella Cruz is being detained up in Greenwood
Let's finish this thing
- Kat's Ford Expedition winds its way through rural New York
speeds past on the left, then as it pulls in front of the Exped ition, its slipstream sucks over some debris from the shoulder; a thin metal piece of trim, which bounces in front of Kat's Expedition's left front tire
'   -- the metal trim is shot upward into the wheel well, where it lodges firmly, its sharp metal edge Kat drives, Thomas reading directions in the shotgun seat
Kimberly, Eugene and Rory ride in back
In the  area, Clear scans out the rear window for danger
Rory fidgets
Is this safe, guys
mean, someone in this car is about to get whacked
Do the rest of us really feel like sitting next to him
(off Kat's glare) Or her
Hopefully her
An uncomfortable beat
Guys, let's not panic
Isabella's safe
How do you know
You said she was going to drive into a lake
How can she when she's in protective custody
'  - Isabella, pissed, is in a holding tank
Small town deputy , 30's,    in her direction
What do you mean "grand theft auto
" This is insane
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday mor ning
(figures it out) Jorge
When  get out of here 'm going to sue his cheating ass off
As she fumes, a rivulet of  streaks down her leg
Oh my God
Steve, at first confused, sees the water and gasps
Are you kidding me
Oh, man
He rushes across the room, pulls a lever, unlocking the cell
'mon
Let's go
As Steve throws on his jacket, we reveal its prominent emblem: '  - Small town station
Only one patrol car
In the patrol car, Isabella buckles up in the sho tgun seat, the belt stretched tightly across her belly
Deputy Steve tries the ignition, but the car won't start
Damn, they always stick me with the clunker
Take my van
- '  speeds through a yellow light and continues on
' Metal sheers away more rubber
Rory, antsy, rubbing his nostrils, stares at two Yankee tickets
Here's what  don't get
For nine months, Death does all this shit to make sure  win these tickets and end up on Route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up
Yeah
But why single me out
What am in the great scheme of things
You'd think  stepped off Flight 180 or something
Fucking weird, man
You want weird
Last year, my partner and  were heading out for the graveyard shift
call comes in about a train wreck and Frank decides to let me handle it alone
(beat) Frank died that night in a shootout
'd be dead too if that call had come in just ten seconds later
Everyone nods in that 'life's weird' reverence kind of way
got that beat
So like, last May,  was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania
There was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the night
Yeah, so what happened
never mad it
The Greyhound bus was on splattered some chick all over the road and we had to stop
Was that in Mt
Abraham
Yeah
How did you know
(sinking realization) That bus you were on
It killed Terry Mathers
She was supposed to die on Flight 180
'm not sure -- Shit
The call about the train wreck that saved my life
That was the night  scraped up Billy Hitchcock
Who
Another kid from Flight 180
chill passes over the group
- Deputy Steve speeds the White Van up the narrow winding road
Isabella breathes Lamaze- style through intense pain
Promise me
won't have the baby
in this van
Speeding up the incline, Steve tries to speed around a Volkswagon Beetle, but cars scream by in the opposite direction
Get around it
Steve leans on the horn and stomps the gas, dangerously riding the shoulder around the Beetle
Way ahead of the Beetle, on the left side, is a
, 15, cheerfully drives a  hauling a across the high crest of the empty road toward a pile of thick branches
The Tractor unexpectedly stalls in the middle of the road
He tries the ignition, pumps the gas
Nothing
Only by standing on the tractor can Brian see the White Van speeding up the hill toward him
He jumps down and frantically tires starting the tractor
Once, twice, nothing
'  - -  shreds away more rubber
'  - Rory excitedly makes a connection
Remember the theater in Paris that collapsed last year, killed everyone inside
Everyone nods, anticipating
had tickets to go, but one day 'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign
Carter
Freaked me out so bad  hid in a shopping cart for four hours
'Course, missed the show
What about you, Kimberly
Did you anyone from Flight-
Clear stops when she sees all the color has drained from Kimberly's face
Even Eugene looks concerned
Are you okay
The car becomes completely silent (except for the slight ) as Kimberly prepares to tell her story
little over a year ago, my mother and  went to the mall
was supposed to meet her outside, but got caught up watching some news report about some kid who committed suicide
kept thinking, "How can you strangle yourself in a bathtub
" That's retarded
Thomas mouths, "Tod
" to Clear
Clear nods
It felt wrong
And yet
(continuing) There were gunshots outside and ran
(chokes up) Some kids tried to jack her car
She fought them off - she was a fighter - and they killed her
Kimberly looks to Clear
After the funeral  had this overwhelming feeling that it should have been me
figured that's how everyone must feel
But  guess was right
Thomas reaches between the seats and takes Kimberly's hand
As he looks into her eyes, Kat takes her own eyes off the road to light a cigarette
The tractor is safely off the road next to a wood pile
Brian grabs a cord and starts up the whoodchipper
'  - It's all starting to come together
When Alex got us off Flight 180, it didn't just change our lives
It affected everyone and everything we've come into contact with ever since
'm not sure  understand
Being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in Death's design
Eugene nods, slowly getting it
So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be ali ve in the first place
That's why Death is working backwards
It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene(s) that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie
In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited
thick retread sheers itself onto the pavement
The wood chipper roar s loudly
Suddenly, some forgotten stray chunk from the spout -- The airborne chunk of   the White Van's windshield
Steve veers out of control
Kat sees the White Van ahead swerving into
She quickly jerks the wheel to the right
Kat's
It sends rubber flying and the entire pulls hard to the left, spinning her out of control into the oncoming lane of traffic - toward the White Van
Isabella
Steve jerks the wheel to the left
The White Van has a close near miss with the Expedition, and goes off the road toward a
Hang on
The  misses the tractor -- but sails off the other side of the embankment, spinning and rolling towards -- ' At the bottom of the hill of a large rural farm, a   sits at the edge of the property
The  barrels down the hill - coming right for it
All Kat can do is cover her head with her arms
Speeding toward the lake
Isabella , in pain, not fear
The White Van is ready for splashdown
Steve finesses the hand brake while tapping the accelerator
He's able to right the van away from the water without so much as a hard jerk
We're okay, we're okay
It's about to get creamed - but the bouncing Expedition just barely misses it
It continues, backwards,  through a temporary fence and right into -- The Expedition plows past earth movers, crashing through irrigation ditches and pipes, shrapnel flying everywhere
Just as the Expedition comes to a stop, an through the rear window -- miraculously missing Clear and Rory -- coming to a rest just behind Kat's head
Steve sees the wreckage on the other side of the highway and slows down
Isabella squeezes his hand white
Please
It's not going to wait
've got to stop and help those people
Do you want to deliver this baby
Steve looks ill, then sees another car stopping by the crash
He floors it and speaks into the shoulder mic of his cop radio
The dust settles in the silent car
The only sound is a , Clear, dazed, looks around carefully, avoiding the that skewers the vehicle
Rory holds his trembling hand before his eyes as if amazed to see it
Kimberly shakes her hair, spilling glass onto the floor
Kat tries to open the door, but it won't budge
Not my time
Amazing
Is everybody alright
Thomas turns to see Eugene  in the back seat
He clutches his ribcage in agony and wheezes
Blood trickles from his mouth
He can't breathe
He can't breathe
Oh my god, Eugene
Eugene's head tilts forward, unconscious
'  - jumps off the tractor and sprints down the hill toward the accident
At the edge of the property is a common farm  made from wooden posts bridged by two thick wires
Brian skillfully climbs between the wires and runs past a ten feet inside the fence
In the ,
darts inside a double-wide construction trailer
(
) Call 9- 1-1
To the crash site
Brian's jaw drops as he absorbs the chilling sight of a guy and a girl dragging a blood- soaked man from the back seat to perform  on him
Around Brian, voices mesh in a surreal haze
Stop it, don't move him
He can't breathe damn it
think his lung's collapsed
Someone call for help
We  around Brian to reveal a woman screaming from the driver's seat
The sound is surreal
can't move my fucking leg
Please get me out of here before it explodes
The color drains from Brian's face as the dying man on the ground coughs blood and the girl performing  recoils
The moment is still surreal as Brian steps back, further away from the horrors he can't face
Into the street -- And Rory yanks him back from imminent death as an onto the property
Watch it, dude
That  Brian back to reality
Sounds become normal again
Brian collects himself and  the air
He then drops to ground level, looking under the Expedition for something
Help us, we need help over here
(to Kat, reassuringly) don't smell any gas
And none's dripping, either
Brian sticks his head in Kat's window and peers down at her trapped leg
He swipes the broken glass away from the window with this thick flannel sleeve, reaches in, and tries to  the door open with all his might
No good, Kat  in pain
Stop that
still need this foot, thank you
Brian steps back as the emergency vehicle speeds over
: '  - Clear watches two  lo ad Eugene into the back of an ambulance
An oxygen mask has been placed over his mouth
Be careful with that, check the gages on the regulator and be mindful of overdoses
Oh, watch for potholes and puddles
As Clear continues, the exasperated Paramedics do their best to ignore her
When she tries to climb inside, she is pushed away
Look,  made him a promise -- Sorry
There's no room
Again, she's shoved away and steps back, helpless
Thomas and Kimberly stand by Kat, still trapped in the
Get that over here
Move move move

Excuse me, hot soup coming through
The hydraulic hose that leads back to the Power Unite '
As the hose tightens, Clear realizes she's surrounded by shards of glass and metal
She quickly  herself free of the hose and watches the Paramedics lock Eugene's gurney into place
One more thing
Watch out for power lines
The doors slam, revealing the    logo
The ambulance speeds off, spraying gravel at her
She reaches into her pocket and withdraws a  cell phone
Shit
She runs back over to Thomas

Immediately,    exits the van to catch the action
Rory steps behind the News Van, making sure he can't be seen, and digs into his sock, coming up with a bindle

) Rory
Rory cringes at his name, pockets his stash, then , the news van gas tank is leaking
'  - Thomas, Kimberly, Clear and Rory watch the    being clamped onto Kat's door
Where's the cell phone Clear gave you
dunno
think  gave it to Eugene back at your place
Damn it
We have to call the Greenwood Police Station and warn Isabella
Thomas runs in the direction of some local
After he leaves, Rory drifts away from the pack, hand in pocket
Kimberly moves back to Kat, who chain -smokes in the front seat of the Expedition
You doing alright in there
My legs are starting to cramp up
And God, why am  so thirsty
Does anyone have any Fiji
The - of the Jaws of Life next to Kat startles her half to death
Christ, you wanna give me a heads up next time, pal
Brian and Mr
Gibbons approach with a cup of tap water
They hand it to kat, who frowns but drinks anyway
: Of the leaking gas becomes a steady trickle
over packed dirt, around debris, toward the crash site
: Speaks to another  who clicks off his radio
She's at Phelps Memorial
They're prepping her to give birth right now
Where's that
few miles up the road
Near the docks
Lights one cigarette off the other  -
The sound makes her flinch, dropping the cigarette on the floor
Damn, can't you be quieter with that thing
(dripping scorn) Sure, 'll just set it to the "quiet" mode
Kat rescues the glowing cigarette from around her feet and inhales
-
She jumps again, but maintains her composure
The gasoline purposefully trickles down corrugated steel, through pipes, closer and closer to the Expedition
At one point, the gas even disappears into a hole in the ground, only to resurface twenty feet closer to the site
Looks confused to watch Rory climb between the fence wires and drift the Dead Oak Tree into the field
Thomas runs down the hill toward Kimberly
We gotta go now
Isabella's in labor
Rescue Workers pull off a large chunk of door
-
Kat Flinches
What about that
(calls over to Kat) How you doing in there, hero
(re: spike behind head) guess it could be worse
Brian hands out drinks to Rescue Workers
So let's go
Where the hell is Rory
Thomas sees Rory in the field and angrily hops the fence, heading directly under the dead Oak Tree
Rory, his back to everyone, finally opens the
Enraptured, he delicately unfolds it
Is put on alert by a fresh
Her attention is caught by the of an emergency vehicle
, Kimberly sees a man sitting on the Expedition, but when she spins ar ound, there's no one there
-
The door comes off the Expedition, finally freeing Kat
Everyone applauds
Wait
Mr
Gibbons, applauding with everyone else, chooses that very moment to sit on the bumper
Kat's head backwards through the spike, -
Kat's dead limp hand drops her last cigarette -- which bounces along the hard dirt -- toward the oncoming gas
Closer, closer,
The , aiding the cigarette
, the gas fuse catches
The blusih flame travels through pipes, over rocks, racing toward the news
Kimberly , half-traumatized, watches an ominous  rustle through the field, up to the trees, toward Thomas
The   up an incline, and disappears into the ground
And pops up twenty feet closer to the News Van
Kimberly follows the  to the dead oak tree under which Thomas stands
And blows a large branch until it snaps
startled Thomas sees it fall just in time to  to safety
Clear, seeing the flame, instinctively runs from the van
Get back
The news van's explosion hurls two fence posts just over Thomas' head, end over end, the two lengths of wire stretched between them
The flying garrote heads directly for -- Rory, who sorts hard, stands up with a satisfied smile - and is sliced into three sharp cuts of beef
The silence from the emergency crew is deafening
Mr
Gibbons starts crying hysterically
didn't mean to do it -  didn't know
Kimberly numbly stares at the fallen branch, the one that caused Thomas to step out of the path of the flying fence
(to herself) It wasn't his turn
And it's not my turn
Kimberly sees the corpses of Kat and Rory, buries the pain, and approaches Mr
Gibbons
Give me the keys to your truck
Now
(hysterical) Anything you want
Anything wish  knew
didn't
Mr
Gibbons hands Kimberly the keys
- Kimberly drives Thomas and Clear in the Gibbons' truck
All are numb
(buckling up) Hurry up
There's no time
She's about to give birth
Kimberly unbuckles her seatbelt and floors it
What are you doing
You're going to kill us
No
If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me
But  can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive
'm last on Death's list
Are you crazy
What makes you think you'd survive
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn
(considering) Six duds in a row
And when it was Rory's turn to die, and Thomas was in the way
That branch fell and saved my life
You're right, Death's maintaining the order
Let's pray that Isabella's still alive
The truck speeds into the horizon
'   - - Typical chatter as the staff preps Isabella

The Anesthesiologist lowers the needle to the base of Isabella's spine

Tracing skin between Isabella's constantly moving vertebra
It buzzes about the room, darting between the he ads of the doctors and nurses, hovering above the -- , who traces the long needle down Isabella's spine, finding the proper vertebrae
Perfectly still now
Everyone freezes

Done
(tears welling) Now could someone please find the open window and fucking close it
- Kimberly speeds the truck down some dangerously twisty roads slick from wet leaves
This makes no sense
Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake
Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested
don't think so
Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it
Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can
If only Alex and  had done that with the others, Alex might still be
somber beat
Then Thomas looks over at the speedometer
Um, Kimberly
This is a neighborhood
You may wanna slow it down
Don't worry
Nothing can happen to us
wasn't worried about us
Suddenly, Kimberly clutches her throat
: - hovers over us in a hospital,  us down by the look of things
There is  all around
The image comes at us so fast, we see only the briefest glimpse of the  on her uniform: (
) Kimberly
Slow down
: - Kimberly "comes to" at the wheel --   at the steering wheel
She even claws at Thomas who tries to control the neglected steering wheel
Slow down
We're
Kimberly looks up as the truck comes around a blind curve, where cars are backed up at a stop sign
Kimberly screams and  on the brakes
The truck  on wet leaves, completely out of control, towards a parked on the shoulder
Kimberly's truck hits the loading ramps and launches itself twenty feet into the air,   -style
And lands miraculously without a scratch
On a parallel road
And keeps going
Dumb, insane fucking luck
Kimberly shakes off her premonition and looks out the rear window
She turns around with a cocky smile
She rubs her throat and   again to Thomas' horror, more determined
(eyes darting) What did you see
What am looking for
No, it's not here
This one was different
More like the pile up and the van going into the lake
It wasn't just a sign,  was there
(confused) Another premonition
Yes
was in a hospital
There was screaming
nurse was choking me
couldn't tell wh at she looked like, but the name tag was right in my face
Kalarjian
Kalarjian
think a nurse named Kalarjian is going to choke Isabella to death
- , a  enters a room and reads a clipboard on an unseen patient's bed
lying in a hospital bed, wired to the latest medical hardware
Nearby, a  plunges up and do wn, the snaking down Eugene's throat
The '  reaches down to Eugene's neck
Eugene  when the Nurse gives the tube a friendly little to check if it's stable
Sorry
Can you feel that in your trachea
Eugene rolls his eyes
Stupid question
Quite complaining
got burnt babies in the Children's Ward braver than you
She sticks an electri c thermometer in his ear
Eugene opens his mouth as if to speak
Don't bother
You won't be talking for at least a month
Think you can handle that, Jabberjaw
Eugene looks ready to cry
The Nurse sits on the bed, jarring Eugene enough to make him  again
Don't worry
Everyone learns to love me once they get used to my sense of humor, okay
Eugene looks grat eful to see a humane side to this creature
- The pick up truck races to the hospital
As Kimberly speeds past a billboard, a   pulls in hot pursuit
Shouldn't we pull over
No time
Keep going
wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway
At the next intersection,
Oh come on
The pick up truck blows by the second pair of cop cars, which instantly join the high speed chase
Kimberly takes a long look in the rearview mirror at the
She then inspects the road ahead
busy six-lane intersection
What do you want me to do
(hesitated beat) Speed up
Yeah, fuck 'em
(to Thomas) No offense
Kimberly  toward the intersection
She pulls her seatbelt aside, making sure it offers  protection
Thomas jumps in the backseat, buckles up
Be alive, Isabella, please be alive
Kimberly's eyes widen in fear
Her foot hesitates over the brake pedal as -- The truck blindly blazes through the busy intersection, miraculously missing every car
The police are just barely able to fishtail into 90 degree turns, avoiding the intersection completely
Kimberly's eyes open and she lets out a victory cry
- Oxygen valve Eugene tries to watch a news flash of  accident on the  across the room, but a bulky  blocks his view
(
) ironically impaled through the head as a result of an emergency airbag deploying
As Eugene shudders with dread, the Orderly pushes a huge cart in front of him, again obscuring his view
Eugene frantically pantomimes writing
Need a pen
Sure
If you like, 'll bring crosswords for you, too
Eugene tries nodding his thanks, but the tube in his throat hampers his movement
(
) police Have speculated that one of the deaths may have been narcotics related and urge children to stay away from d rugs
Finally, the Orderly pushes the cart away, revealing the
An taps his pages on the desktop
Good advice, Sue
And stay in school
Up next, Johnny Showers has the weather
dressed as a frog points out cloud formations
Eugene, tormented, stares at the screen as the Orderly begins pushing the huge cart out of the room
The sound of a   fills the room
It comes from the which shows a  featuring
Jeez, it's freezing in here
The Orderly flicks the thermostat and one by one,   just below the ceiling
Eugene's eyes fill with terror - he knows something's wrong
- Bursting
It  softly
We follow the   out of the room
- hospital  briskly strides up to the Orderly
What are you doing
The Henzels are still waiting for you in the Children's Ward -- The Orderly smacks his forehead - shit
Totally forgot
Right, right, right
Gregory's big day
And Mrs
Dempsey in hydrotherapy can't feel her legs
The Orderly, nodding rapidly, is halfway down the hall by now
The Administrator shakes his head in disgust and walks past
The
Which now blocks the door on Eugene's room
- Kimberly seems to have ditched the cops
She speeds the pick up through the medical facility
- The pick up skids to a halt in front of the hospital
Kimberly, Thomas and Clear run outside and into the building
- The   hisses, but is drowned out by the volume of the
Eugene's eyes dart frantically as a blaring fast food commercial ends
The n, a   comes on
The : 18 Footage showing grieving families, wreaths on doors, yellow ribbons, and emergency crews pulling wreckage apart, dissolve together over: (
) Mor e tears were    shed this morning in the wake of     yesterday's tragedy that rocked the     Tri -State area
Suddenly, the    of Eugene's  begins sparking
The sound  , the picture
Eugene goes white with terror
He looks back to -- The broken

The  of the  machine frantically increase
Eugene reaches for the nurse call switch
Mockingly out of reach by mere millimeters
- Clear, Kimberly and Thomas dash toward the main desk
Isabella Cruz
What room's she in
'm sorry,  can't give out that info unless you're a relative
'm her sister
The Receptionist eyes her dubiously
'll have to see your , Ms
Cruz
Clear vaults over the counter, straight-arms the Receptionist and seizes the computer
Thomas and Kimberly look on, stunned
Delivery rooms are downstairs
'll find Eugene and catch up with you
Kimberly and Thomas hurry to the elevator banks
then reconsider and enter the stairwell
- Eugene scratches the top sheet of the bed, trying to inch the call- switch closer and closer to him
But it won't budge
behind Eugene's pillow,  over his chest and disappears by his stomach
He pounds desperately on the empty food tray, his side rails, looks toward the door -- - Outside the door, you can't hear a thing in the bustling hallway as people rush by
Kimberly and Thomas rush past his door, lost
Hurry,  think she's this way
His eyes scream insanely, but he respirator tube prevents any sound from escaping him
And that's when the  appears on the floor and begins gnawing on the respirator's power cord
When Eugene sees this, the  machine climbs off the charts
- Clear takes off down the hallway
The Receptionist, shaken, dials her phone
Security
- The Obstetrician voices concern
Listen to me, Isabella,  need you to stop pushing
What's wrong
the baby all right
It's a breach
If  can't reverse it, we may need to do a Caesarian
The Obstetrician's hands go to work
Steve looks ill
Maybe  should step outside
Running down the corridor
Code Blue in Delivery Room 6
Code Blue
- The rat  away at Eugene's power cord, Eugene looks trapped, helpless, tortured
His eyes dart from the sparking  to the gnawed power cord to the useless call- switch
- Clear walks up and down the corridor, scanning room numbers as she passes
-169, - 171, -173
-187
-187
suddenly  Clear and shoves her against the wall leering at her
Just where do you think you're going
Clear struggles to get away, getting sympathetic looks from an walking a rolling   down the corridor
- Isabella is pushing again
Almost there

The  takes a pair of  off a tray
- Clear plays possum, offering no resistance to the Security Guard as the Old Man wheels his   along
Suddenly, Clear grabs the stand - and  the heavy wheeled base into the Guard's
As the Guard recoils, she thoughtfully hands the  back to the Old Man and runs
0 The Nurse is startled when Kimberly and Thomas   the door
In the , a puzzled Steve peeks inside until Kimberly pulls the door closed
What are you doing in here
Get the hell out
Right now
Finally we hear the
The Nurse immediately moves in to swaddle the newborn
Dr
Kalarjian beams at the very groggy looking Isabella
Isabella, look down and see your son
To the confusion of everyone around them, Kimberly and Thomas They jump, dance and hug each other
It's a magical moment -- '   - The  stops gnawing
The  stops sparking
wave of intense relief washes over Eugene
He pantomimes reaching into his shirt pocket and lighting a victory cigar
- Relaxed and invigorated, Kimberly and Thomas giddily exit the delivery room as Clear runs up to them
guard grabbed me before  could find Eugene
Don't sweat it
It's over
She had the baby
New life defeats death
We've done it
Death has to rewrite the list
We're safe
Steve watches, confused, as Clear whoops with delight and  the others
Clear laughs with a relief that seems completely foreign to her
Kimberly laughs with her, then is suddenly rocked by a vision -- : Looking up a the  machine
Flatlined
(
) Kimberly
Are you okay
- Kimberly, on the ground, looks frazzled as she  out of her trance
Thomas helps her to her feet
Are you okay
You just face planted
know how it feels to be dead
Her lips blue, Kimberly shivers uncontrollably
Clear sees round a distant corner and quickly walks the others toward an
What did you see
was dead
And came back to life
An  machine
Where's Eugene
But it's over
Isabella's baby was the key
You saw her die and everything, right
don't
what if  made a mistake
Impossible
She was on the onramp
Kimberly reluctantly closes her eyes and remembers
: Moment of the pile-up premonition
in fr ont of Kimberly suddenly slams on its brakes and pulls onto the shoulder
Kimberly screams, swerving around the van just in time to avoid an accident
: Kimberly, overcome with self- doubt
'm not sure
don't think Isabella was ever destined to die in the pile -up
Then what's the premonition of the lake supposed to mean
Can you remember anything about it
Kimberly shuts her eyes, remembering: - Grease-covered hands reach out toward a steering wheel of a white van speeding out of control
The van crashes through a railing and  into the water
In moments, the van fills with water, the driver inside trapped
Drowning
Horrible
And on the rearview mirror, six floral scented -
: Kimberly looks down at her grease -covered hands and looks ill
the Same hands from the van
Finally everything makes sense to Clear
It's you Kimberly
The premonitions are about you
Kimberly trembles, refusing to accept what she's hearing
No
It can't be
(suddenly remembering) have to save Eugene
Clear leaves Kimberly and Thomas together
Kimberly verges on tears and Thomas consoles her with a hug
Clear looks at passing room numbers while hurrying down the corridor
She comes to a room with a   parked outside, blocking the door
She looks up to see -  -187
Clear leans into it, pushing it out of the way of the door
Eugene
Are you in there
' Eugene strains to hear through the thick door
(
) Can you hear me
'm coming in
An intense wave of relief washes over Eugene
: As Kimberly hugs Thomas, she watches Clear push the cart past the door
(
) Make way, make way lovebirds
Kimberly spins as Eugene's Orderly passes her; a paper, pen and a crossword book in one hand,    in the other
The  reads "Happy Birthday Gregory"
The on top   Clear's head
Oh no
The Orderly speeds down the corridor toward Clear, whose hand reaches for Eugene's door handle
She leans into it -- (to Clear) Thanks hon, the Henzels are going crazy for this thing
Watch as Clear opens the door, briefly revealing Eugene, a whoosh of Oxygen -- Clear's body is obscenely hurled    towards the , heading straight for Kimberly and Thomas
Thomas throws himself and Kimberly around the corner to prevent being crushed by Clear's lifeless body
The hospital erupts in total chaos
Just as Kimberly is about to break down completely, she sees -- hurrying down the hallway in their direction, pushing a crash cart
Kimberly sees the nametag:
Nurse Kalarjian
Doctor Kalarjian
Excuse me, please
rest on top
And then Dr
Kalarjian passes them toward the area of the explosion
, the camera following her view, until she sees a small lake across the street from the hospital
Oh my God
That's it
The lake
The  machine
Nurse Kalarjian
What
Just then, an   up to the nearest entrance jump out and run towards the blast site
You can't cheat destiny
know what  have to do to save us have to die
That's crazy
You can't give up now
We can still fight this thing
But Kimberly isn't listening
She stares through the glass doors at the -- red stripe down the side, but the hood is completely white
Six floral scented air-fresheners hang from the rearview
The 'van' from her vision
And it's running
have to do this
Kimberly wipes tears from her eyes, kisses Thomas' cheek, then turns and runs before he can speak
- Kimberly heads right for the open ambulance
The driver's door almost seems to swing open for her as she gets in
- Thomas frantically tries to get through the electric doors, which and short out
He struggles to pry them apart
- Kimberly shifts into gear and speeds off
Thomas squeezes through the doors and runs after her
An , the driver of the stolen ambulance, rushes outside
What the fuck
- Thomas chases the ambulance, watching helplessly as it barrels over curbs, pylons and a fence, ultimately plunging straight into the lake
Thomas sprints to the lake as fast as he can - the  trailing far behind
Kimberly panics as the ambulance fills with water and she takes a final gasp of air -- ' Thomas stares in horror at the percolating air bubbles as the vehicle descends below the surface -- and he dives in
Thomas swims into the dark, murky water
Deeper and deeper, he g ets to the ambulance and tries to open the door
Stuck
He withdraws his baton and  on the glass - nothing
He tries coming up for air, but his pants snag on the jagged metal of the twisted bumper
He squirms frantically
And as his exhausted body loses consciousness, everything -- - (
) Ready and
The  of defribulator paddles brings Kimberly back to life
' Looking up at Dr
Kalarjian, all she can see is part of a woman's face and a partial nametage reading "Kalarjian"
It would appear as if she's choking Kimberly, but -- An   turns from a flatline to a steady heartbeat, the same as the premonition
She's back
Five 's of narcodon
want her stabilized and prepped for
Kimberly turns her head to see Unconscious,  being performed on him by the  (who's now soaking wet)
Thomas doesn't respond
An  opens an eyelid, points a flashlight at his eyes
Shakes his head, nothing
The sopping wet  goes back to performing
Finally, Thomas coughs up water, chokes, gasps for air, then Kimberly
He turns to see Kimberly reaching out for him
Immeasurably relieved, he takes her hand and allows himself to be eased back down to the platform
Kimberly's eyes fill with tears
(whispering) Welcome back
We did it
For real
know
can feel it too
Outside, a parting of dark clouds causes a shaft of sunlight to flood into the hospital
Its light covers Kimberly and Thomas with an ethereal glow
There are no more doubts; they've won
They exchange meek, yet triumphant smiles in the smoky, chaotic hospital
: - We are at a summer barbecue
Frisbee, lawn darts, croquet, et
Everyone's happy
: Shish -Kabob entering a mouth
Kimberly taking a bite, relishing the taste and calmly pulling the metal skewer from her mouth
My God, this is delicious
can't believe  used to be a vegan
Thomas, out of uniform, takes a bite of his own
As the metal skewer is deep in his mouth -- running   accidentally bumps into Thomas
But no harm
Thomas gives the guy a friendly pat and goes back to rewrapping his mouth around the shish-kabob
(
) So what's the deal, Thomas
Three months and you still haven't asked my daughter out on a date
Kimberly turns red as Mr
Burroughs appears and takes a seat
What's wrong with a platonic relationship
Platonic my ass
That's for ugly women
For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad
(smiling) Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment
Oh please
'm not hurting anyone
(looking around, lowering voice) Besides, if you can beat Death, what's he got to worry about me for
Mr
Gibbons sits down at the table with two plates of food
His wife, , joins
You know, you still never explained to us how you did it
It seems by now everyone's familiar with the concept
Well, technically when we died, we gave Death what it wanted
And by the time we were revived, it had already moved on to graver pastures
Mrs
Gibbons makes a face, finding the discourse distasteful
She changes the conversation
You know, 'm having the greatest day
Food's great too, Mrs
Gibbons
Big props to you and Brian
Our
pleasure
So, ready for the back-to -school season
, right
Three short glorious weeks away
Sounds wonderful
wish  were going myself
(to Mr
Burroughs) You may want to think twice about letting her live in the village, Bob
Our eldest daughter moved there and came back with piercings all over her face
(looks grave) Among other places
chorus of friendly laughter
(
) Dad used to call her the pincushion
From Hellraiser
enters frame, soaking up fresh laughter
He holds a plate full of raw chicken fillets and some long, wooden matches
Dad, you had the spatula last, right
Sure, here
Mr
Gibbons hands it over and Brian saunters away from camera, , toward the barbecue, his body framed between Kimberly and Thomas' heads
Brian looks like he's having fun
Sure does
Owes it to that friend of yours, in a way
Mr
Gibbons immediately regrets having said that
How's that
Well, Brian was nearly hit by an ambulance the day
but your friend Rory pulled him back at the last second
Kimberly and Thomas ominously turn their heads around
In the , Brian fidgets in front of the barbecue
You never told me that, Peter
Boy, that was lucky
The   blows Brian to smithereens
deafening silence follows, punctuated when Brian's  lands on Mrs
Gibbons' plate
