Shooting Script  2/26/91 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1	      - - -  '  	 1 This is Ash, mid twenties, square jaw firmly set and a pair of haunted eyes which dart about quickly in fear
Ash speaks to the  with urgency: Why would you say that  am insane
wouldn't say that 've lost my mind simply because 've heard the voices and seen the godless things moving in the woods
If anything,  think more clearly now than ever before know now that there is such a thing as a living Evil
dark and shapeless thing that lives not in the spaces we know, but between them
In the Dark
In the night
And it wants the exact same thing as you and : a chance at warm life on this Earth
It doesn't care that is already had that chance
once
Now listen closely because there isn't much time
Listen and believe, because it's all true

Through the window, we see the tiny figure of Ash picking up a book from a desk
(
) first saw the damn thing at that blasted cabin
The Necronomicon
An ancient Sumarrian text, bound in human flesh and inked in human blood
It contained bizarre burial rites, prophesies
and instruction for demon resurrection
It was never meant for the world of the living

12 Ash is rocketing through a funnel of swirling clouds
He is swept away from us, hand over foot, through the dark void of Time

Tumbling weightless through this void we find

She searches the faces of Arthur's warriors and grows concerned
She pushes through a crowd of villagers and calls up to Arthur atop his horse
'Lord Arthur
Where is my brother
Did he not ride with you
Eye
And fought valiantly
But last night fell in battle to Duke Henry's men
Her face does not immediately register the grief
She attempts to step forward but stumbles
She steadies herself against the stone wall
Her eyes harden as she sees the first of the shackled prisoners: a semi-conscious Ash
She flushes with anger and races up to him
She spits and kicks at him as he's dragged along
Foul thing

Jack and shit
And Jack left town

And whilst my people fight for their very souls against it, you, Duke Henry the Red, wage war on us
Your people are no better than the foul corruption that lies in the bowels of that pit
May God have mercy on your souls

They turn their attention to the remaining prisoners: from their bloodthirsty faces to the next prisoner in line

It's rotted corpse rockets up from the water inches from Ash's face

It jerks like a marionette as it advances

He gets one foot up

He shrieks and flails about, into the screaming crowd
Warrior tears the hand free from his face, tossing it back down into the pit

Followed by
Ash's bloody hand
Then his bruised face
Covered in the black blood of the Deadites
He crawls to his feet
Ash tuns to the crowd, his list clenched
All right now
Who wants to be next
Who wants some
150	 										    150 look at Ash stupidly
Ash shoves him
You want some more
Huh
Gold Tooth and the others give him a wide berth
Ash calls out to Henry
Now climb on those horses and get out of here

Nay

For that,  shall see you dead

This is my boomstick
It's a twelve gauge, double barreled Remington pump
Next one of you primitives touch me
157	 ,										    157 pointing the barrel just past Arthur
He, but no one else, has spotted the surviving Second Deadite crawling up from the pit on the forgotten chain
The crowds gasp is cut short by
-
The shotgun belches flame
The blast cuts the chain, leaving the Deadite teetering at the pit's edge
158	 											 158 -
The second shot blows the beast into a backflip, sending it summersaulting down into the pit

164
-   - 					  164 massive grouping of freestanding rectangular stones, each twenty feet tall
The remains of an ancient temple
In the center of the ruins there burns a roaring bonfire
As old Woman stirs a cauldron atop the flames
Nearby, Arthur converses with his four Lieutenants
165
- 							165 - opens his mouth to allow a spoonful of food to enter
No sooner has he swallowed then a piece of fruit is offered
He waves it away with a satisfied burp and turns to drink from a goblet on wine, brought to his lips by a female hand
166	  										166 sits across the flames from Arthur and his men
She bandages Ash's wounds

She looks good

She touches Ash's hand
Ash turns away First you wanta kill me, now ya wanna kiss me
He spits out a mouthful of grape seeds
Lady, just leave me alone
'm sorry m'lord
Please understand
'is a cruel time for us
The Wisemen say you are the promised one
Our only hope against the darkness that has descended on this land
They're mistaken
She stares deeply into his eyes

feel that there is reason for your being here
It is no accident

They sit in tall stone chairs across the fire from Ash
Well what is it
Can you send me back or not
Only the Necronomicon has the power
power which we both require
It contains passages that can dispel the Evil from this place and return you to your time
The Necronomicon
Yeah, that's the thing that got me here
It is in a place far from here
It can only be retrieved by the Promised one
Other Warriors have tried
Their widows grieve still
We have waited long years for you
Out only hope is the Necronomicon
Thou must undertake to quest for it
Alone must thou travel to a distant cemetery
There thou shalt find it
Me

She does not respond as flames sweep up her body
She continues to stir the caldron

He slowly stands as
173	  									  173 spins sharply to him
Her voice changes as she ; Her eyes are bone white
She is  by the dark spirit
Her burning body is violently jerked about in the air by invisible hands
Her blackened lips pull back in a wild animal snarl
With two voice at once; , 174	  									174 collapses
Her face turned away from the Wisemen as it lays in the dust

The multi-ton stone crushes her legs to paste
Her legs are pinned but still she battles on, clutching Ash about his throat

This is the edge of the land ruled by the Dark Spirit

Okay
Repeat them

All right
Now you get this straight:  get the book, you send me back
That's the deal
After that 'm history
Ash rears up on his horse and gallops into the mist 221	   								 221 watch as Ash disappears

234													 234 frantically weaves his horse around storm felled trees which jut from the ground
235	  										235 rips through the trees, splintering them to toothpicks
It burrows underground, and resurfaces, always closing upon Ash
236													 236 jerks upon the reins and his steed leaps a fallen tree
He gracefully leaps a second tree
But as he leaps over the third, he is ripped off the horse by a low branch
He falls hard to the mud as the horse gallops off
He groggily stands and stumbles onward

238													 238 running for

249													 249 delivers a mighty kick to the door

250 The partially cut log gives way
Ash tumbles into the storage shed
He slams the door shut and slides the remainder of the log across the latch, re-bolting it

252 terrified Ash braces his back against the door
Earth shaking in its intensity
The planks of the door shudder behind Ash

254													 254 presses himself against the door for all he's worth, praying that whatever it out there, won't get in
Splinters fly

And the  halts

Ash hugs the door
Shaking in the silence
And that's when it hits
Ash and the door he braces are blasted away from the wall of the Shed as the Evil Force brings it's tremendous power to bare
259
- -- - 					 259 as they are swept up at super speed in the grip of the Evil Force
Ash is seen rocketing through the long hallway of the Shed, spinning head over heels
Ash rips through other doors, taking them with him
Ash is now sandwiched between two doors as he flies through the air
260
-  								   260 The roof of the shed ripples, sending tiles and wood beams flying as the   surges through the shed like a tidal wave
261
261 It blows out from the place in a flying stack along with the other doors
The flying doors slam against a tree and fall to the ground in a stack
262	  										262 with Ash out of sight, glides forward, into the woods
263
- 									    263 -
All is quiet
We hear the sound of a bolt moving
The doorknob turns slightly
The door swings upward and opens
revealing a somewhat flattened Ash who picks his groggy and bruised self up
He beholds
264
264 An empty place of stone and wood
Driven by the wind, the Mill's giant grinding wheel slowly turns with a squeak
265
265 enters the Mill
Anybody here
The place is quiet
Ash slumps down against a wall to catch his breath
This place'll do for the night
Get the book in the morning

The wind kicks up

Ash shivers and rubs his arms for warmth
Damn this cold
271													 271 looks about the Mill and spots an iron stove
272												 272 pours out of Ash's chainsaw over some logs in the stove's belly
273													 273 lights the fire with his Zippo lighter and huddles near the flame for warmth
'least  won't freeze to death
He turns to a tiny sound
274	  - 									    274 behind him, through the window, a large gnarled hand sweeps past
275													 275 spins, raises his shotgun and fires
-
The window is ripped away in a shower of glass
276	'
-    				    276 Only the night woods
The "gnarled hand" comes back, sweeping down in front of the broken window, but it's revealed to be just a tree branch swaying in the wind
277													 277 reloads
He moves to the front door and peers out through a crack
278	' 										 278 through the crack in the door

-   						   279 pushes through the crack to the woods beyond
There is movement

282	'  								   282 It rears up on it's hind legs
It's front hoofs come down toward Ash
283	  										283 leaps aside just in time
284													 284 snags the horse's reigns
Easy, boy
The horse calms
Ash ties it to a tree, patting it's head shadow passes behind him
He turns toward the Mill
285	'
'  				  285 He sees am image of himself inside the Mill
Peering out
286
286 stares in disbelief, then the wind slams the front door of the Mill, halting Ash's view
Ash races for the Mill
287
287 races through the door and toward  when
Ash's reflection shatters
He's run into a mirror
Shivering, he picks himself up from the pile of broken glass
He moves to the fireplace and hunches before the flames,
288	   							  288 Each piece of mirror reflects an image of Ash
From the eight pieces of mirror spring
289	  									   289 Two inch high versions of himself
They leap from the mirror fragments and land on the floor
290													 290 is unaware of them as he kneels close to the fire
291	  #1, #2,  #3								 291 grab a discarded dinner fork
Like men on a battering ram, they race forward to jam it into Ash's buttocks
292													 292 in agony and jerks forward, banging his head into the stove pipe
293	  #4, #5,  #6								 293 lift the barrel of the shotgun in Ash's direction
Another leaps upon the shotgun's trigger
294													 294 barely dives away from the blast the would have taken his head off
295	  										295 with uncontrollable laughter
They jump away from the shotgun and scurry off across the floor
296													 296 pulls the fork from his buttocks and heaves it
297	  #1										   297 is running for his life, as fast as his tiny legs will carry him

300													 300 stumbles over a broom handle that has been thrust out in front of him by other tiny
His head slams into a stove pipe
He crumples
He lands with his cheek pressed against the hot stove
SSSSSSssss
He pries his face loose with a spatula
301	   									 301 is pushed off a high shelf
302	   ' 								  302 and spills slippery grease about the floor
303													 303 with an upside-down bucket on his head, slips and falls, back and forth on the grease
He stands and tries to dislodge the bucket
He trips over the broom handle, again thrust in his path
He falls backward, onto a crochet basket with knitting needles jutting from it
304	- 									  304 and jerks upward, slamming his bucket head into the stove pipe
Ash rips the bucket from his head then yanks the needles from his buttocks
He looks about for the little imps
305	  #2										   305 crouching behind a log attempting to hide
306													 306 has seen him
He "accidentally" elbows the log and Tiny Ash #2 into the stove's fire
Ooops
307	  #2										   307 is burned alive
308													 308 glances downward at the pitter patter sound of tiny feet
309	  #3										   309 is dashing across the open expanse of floor
Ash's gigantic foot comes down to crush the little man
Tiny Ash #3 raises a rusty nail into the path of the descending foot
310	  										 310 through Ash's shoe
311													 311 jerks his leg upward in pain
Ash dances about the place hopping on one foot,
He strays into the greasy area of the floor and stumbles over the broomstick again thrust in his path, swung there by Tiny  #6, #7 and #8
He almost regains his balance when he strays into the oil patch, falls, and hits his head on the stone floor
312													 312 awakens on the floor of the Mill, like Gulliver he is bound with tiny ropes
Directly above him, on the edge of a table
313	  #4  #5								    313 suspend Tiny Ash #6 by his legs
314	  #7  #8									 314 stand atop Ash's face
They push from either side of his nostrils, plugging his nose

As he inhales

316	  #6 -   -  					   316 He free falls for a moment, then the tiny body arcing to form a perfect swam dive, plunges down into Ash's opened throat
317													 317 inhales the living beast whole
He chokes violently
He breaks his bonds an he hacks for breath
He puts his finger down his throat, trying to make himself vomit up the little man, to no avail
He looks about to crush some of the little  but they are gone
He places his hand on his stomach and dizzily stumbles to a chair
He goes pale
Nasty little thing's inside me
He stands indignant but double over in sudden pain
Well let's see how you like a little hot water
He grabs the hot kettle from the stove and pours the scalding contents painfully down his throat
He sets down the kettle and waits for a moment
tiny  emits from Ash's stomach emits a bark of
He clutches as his chest
Then his arm
He rips back his shirt sleeve
318	  '  -   				  318 We can see the outline of Tiny Ash #6's body squirming down Ash's arm, just beneath the skin
319													 319 watches in horror as
320	  									    320 squirms down his wrist and disappears into his iron hand
The Iron hand snaps open and closes uncontrollably
The possessed iron hand swings at him
321	  										 321 connects with an uppercut that knocks Ash out of frame
322													 322 lands next to an iron vice
He reaches for the
But the hand has grabbed a mallet that - him on the head
Ash is groggy as he is grabbed by the hair and yanked down into the opened vice
323	   									 323 cranks the vice's handle
324	 											 324 tightens around Ash's head
Trapped, he looks to
325	  										 325 rummaging through a wooden toolbox
It comes upon a crude wooden punch
326	 -    - 					   326 stabs rapidly at Ash's good hand
But Ash expertly dodges each stab with an opening of the fingers or a closing of the thumb is super fast motion
327													 327 with is head still wedged in the vice
Why you dirty little
328	    								   328 has entered frame and clamps down upon Ash's nose
He emits a nasal  and shakes the pliers loose
Soon as  get out of this thing dip into Ash's mouth and clamps down upon a back molar
No
Not the teeth
329	  										 329 jerks his rear  from his head and holds up the tooth for his inspection
It sets the tooth down nearly in front of him
The Evil hand forms a fist and crushes the tooth to dust
It scurries from view
330	' 										    330 struggling in the grip of the vice
Where the hell are ya
331	  										 331 grabs a red hot fireplace poker from the fire
can't see ya
raises a red hot fireplace poker and presses it against the right half of his body
No, no--not the poke-- SSSSsssssssss
332													 332 jerks his head free from the vice with a
He holds up his iron hand
It's back to normal
Again under his control
Okay then
But he halts abruptly as he feels a strange sensation: His shoulder itches
He scratches it
The Itch grows
It itches madly
He rips back his shirt
Upon his shoulder 333	      				    333 It is the eyeball of
Beneath it, a mouth and nose begin to take shape on the surface of Ash's back

- 12MM  - 						   335 staggers about in a frenzy, stumbling over logs and through the brambles
He races up to the  and cries out as this protrusion upon his shoulder becomes more pronounced
Dear God, it's growing bigger
336
336 It's taking the shape of a twin human head as it emerges from his shoulder
head that looks similar to his own, but is Evil incarnate
He is now a man with two heads
337	  										337 Staggers through the woods like a drunkard, the two identical heads trading insults, and sharply butting against one another
338	   									   338 opens it's mouth and bites the nose of the Good Ash head
339	   									  339 retaliates by gouging the eyes of the Bad Ash head
340	  										340 collapses against a tree
Under the light of the full moon we see a terrifying sight: 341	  									341 sprout from Ash's body
342	 											    342 rips out of his stomach
Another foot  out from his back
343	  										343 Like a human spider he scurries about the forest floor, propelled by his four arms and four legs
Suddenly he stands and  as the   begins to pull away from the first
He literally splits into two

and
345
345 They square off beneath the moonlight

Why are you doing this
Wanna know

He  Ash across the face as he sings: Little goody two- shoes, little goody two- shoes, little good-- 348	 											 348 the shotgun barrel is suddenly shoved into his frame, pointing at his nose

The blast blows Evil Ash off his feet

We hear the distant  of the chainsaw
360
- 								  360 with shovel in hand, drags a bloody burlap bag from the Mill
Grunting, he pulls the remains of his Evil twin to the base of an old Oak Tree in the graveyard
Ash mumbles nervously to the bloodies burlap bag at his feet as he digs a grave
Now you see what's what
Man's body is his own personal property
Don't anybody try to take that away from him
361													 361 finishes digging and lifts the bloody burlap sack
As he heaves the bag into the grave, the Evil Ash head spills out
362
-    						    362 It's eyes pop open
It peers up at Ash from the grave
It croaks; You'll never get that Book
will come back for you
Hey, what's that you got on your face

Ha
That Wiseman was so busy fillin' me fulla his secret words and phrases and, and, his
bullshit, he forgot to mention anything about that
Like do  take all of 'em of one or 'em, or what
Well
He reaches for the first book and opens it
380	 											 380 To reveal a black hole
from the dark abyss of the Book
It begins to suck things into it
381	      -  				381 dead leaves and mist are sucked into the book
382	 - - 								 382 Wind hits Ash's face as he feels the suction of the book growing stronger

Woah
Wrong book
He turns to study
388	   								 388 tries to decide between them
At first he's sure which one it is
Then, chiding himself for being so easily duped, chooses the other
389	 											 389 moves ever so slightly as he reaches for it
Huh
Ash reaches for it again and the book bites him
390	     - 							390 Rodent teeth have appeared on the surface of the Book
The Book flaps it's pages and becomes airborne, flying right at like a bat
391
-   - 				  391 Swooping erratically around Ash's head
392	 										   392 shrieking, chases Ash around, pecking at his neck
Dear God, help me
ahhh
The Batbook is pecking at his eyes
393													 393 pulls it from his face and throws it
It lands back on it's pedestal
394													 394 faces the remaining book
He slowly reaches for it as the wind kicks up
Ash gently lifts it and turns it over

Two empty eye sockets stare out from it
This is the Book of the Dead
396													 396 bristles in fear
Okay
The words
Say the words
uh
Uh
Necta
uh
Nectar
Necktie
uh
He hesitates, then calls out boldly
NECTtphhhhhhhhhh
He deliberately muffles the last word that he can't remember
The wind stops
It seems to have worked
He looks about with growing confidence
Okay then
But he loses his smile as
a   is heard on the soundtrack

Leave me alone
Leave me aHUUU

With his tongue held, he tries to speak again, but the other skeletal hand slaps him, shutting him up
