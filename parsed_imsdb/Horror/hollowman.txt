The Hollow Man written by Andrew

Revised Draft 6/26/98 : On complete darkness
swings open
circle of light reveals that we  re looking down the length of a tube
At the far end of the tube, we see a gloved hand dangling a rat
The hand shoves the frightened rat into the tube and closes the door behind it
The rat s stark white fur bristles and it begins to pad down the tube s length
After several feet, the tube opens up into a dimly lit cubicle
The rat hesitates and stops
The  of gentle  whispers in the rat s ears
The rat turns round to head back down the tube, but a door swings shut, trapping it in the cubicle
The rat cowers as the  turns to
The rat s head jerks around, looking for signs of danger, but the cubicle is empty
The rat sees a water dish on the far side of the cubicle - a place to hide - and dashes toward it
But an invisible force descends
The rat squeals in agony as something smashes down on its body, crushing it
rings out, and the rat flies into the air, halting a few feet off the ground
Its body writhes, struggling against the unholy force
Then a sick crunch of tiny bones snapping
All life quickly drains from the levitating body
Dead eyes
The creature s corpse floats in mid-air
Then the white fur of the rat explodes in a shower of blood
appear, as do the red-slicked ape- like lips
The gaping bloody mouth bites again into the rat
: - In the background we hear Jay Leno s monologue from the Tonight Show
small lamp and the glow from a computer screen illuminates  , late twenties with the shabby good looks of a perpetual grad-student
Wiry framed and wearing only boxer shorts, Sebastian sips coffee from an  Einstein  coffee mug
He peers at a complex computer rendered molecule displayed on his screen
He pecks a few keys and the molecule shifts slightly, then falls apart
Sebastian pulls a twinkie from a hostess box, unwraps the cellophane and sucks it down
He attacks the keyboard with renewed vigor
Another molecule appears on the screen
Sebastian s fingers fly across the keyboard
The molecule blinks on and off, it trembles and twists apart
Damnit
Sebastian pears out his window
Across the courtyard, a light comes on in a neighboring window
He sees a , mid-twenties, absolutely stunning, enter her living room
The Brunette thumbs through the mail, tosses it and then begins to undress
Sebastian loans over to the window, getting interested
But when the brunette reaches her bra and panties, she crosses to the window and lowers her shades
(cont d) Damnit
Sebastian leans back in his chair and closes his eyes
He s obviously tired
He opens his eyes and stares up at the ceiling
Painted across the white matte finish in big red letters is a brief reminder -  You Should Be Working
Sebastian sighs, leans forward and begins pecking away again
: The television is now only static
We pan by his alarm clock
4 am
We find Sebastian pacing in front of his computer
He gets an idea
slides back in his chair
Types away again
The molecule reforms on the computer screen
He types a few more keys, waits, watches the molecule
Nothing happens
He hits a few more keys and watches intently for a reaction
(beat) am a goddamn genius
He hits a few more keys and a telephone keypad appears on the screen
He dials
: - Digital phone rings
In the bed,  , late twenties, stirs from a deep sleep
As she straggles out of bed and over to her desk, we notice a young man sleeping next to her
The ringing continues
She moves her computer mouse around and her screen comes to life
She click on a telephone icon and the ringing stops
beat later, Sebastian appears in a window on her screen
Sebastian, do you know what time it is
() You know Da Vinci never slept
Said it was waste of time
What is it this time
: Sebastian peers at the image of Linda in the computer window
He notices something behind her in the bed, the young man sleeping face down
Who s that
Linda pulls the camera off the top of the of the computer screen and positions it so Sebastian can t see the bed
Not your business
Not anymore
Touche
So you calling about anything in particular, or were you just hoping to catch me sleeping in the nude
cracked the reversion
Upon hearing this, Linda receives a jolt of adrenaline
You cracked it
Look at this
Sebastian hits a couple of keys
moment later the molecular structure appears on Linda s computer
Watch this
You sure
91% sure
(astonished) Eleven months with no progress and you suddenly come up with it out of the blue
How
The usual
Coffee and twinkies
hate you
know
You think you could hunt down Matt and get to the lab early
want Isabelle prepped for a live test
Yeah,  think  can find him
What are you going to do
Well y know
It s daylight in Switzerland
gotta call the Nobel Committee and tell them to get our prizes ready
See you in a few
as Sebastian clicks off
Linda crosses to her bed, and shakes the guy awake
Hey
come on
, late 20s too, stirs from under sheets
(groggy) What
Sebastian just called
We gotta get to the lab
Matt bolts up
Shit
You didn t tell him  was here, did you
Give me some credit, will ya
So what s the rush
He cracked reversion
Matt pulls his jeans on
Wanna ride down
We better take our own cars
You re gonna have to tell him about us eventually
know
It s just You re his best friend
He ll feel betrayed
- From a distance, the Nation s Monuments stand awash in the harsh light of morning
finds a   as it pulls to the security fence of a warehouse
The imposing structure is surrounded by a chainlink fence and barbed wire
The Porsche is waved through security and heads straight into the warehouse
- The Porsche pulls to a halt in a reserved parking space and Sebastian exits, wearing a Hawaiian shirt, shorts, and Birkenstocks
He notes the other cars parked in the lot, then crosses to bunker in the center of the warehouse, guarded by a , shouldering an -16
Morning, sir
Morning, Ed
Your team s in early
Something special going on
Sorry, Ed
You know the rules
Sebastian presses his thumb against a glass screen laser reads his print
Scan readout: , Clearance: Division: The doors whisk open and Sebastian steps inside
Have a good day, sir
- Inside the elevator is a numberless keypad
Sebastian taps in his floor code
(
0
) Authorization please
Caine zero zero two seven
(
0
) Authorization verified
Good morning, Dr
Caine
The elevator descends with a groaning hum
It passes below us and keeps descending into the belly of the earth, the shaft goes down forever
We slowly push down a hallway panelled by Plexiglas chambers
Each chamber looks as if it s tailored for a specific animal, although no animals are visible
As we pass one habitat, something slams into the Plexiglas and begins barking
Another  joins in
Then Suddenly the hallway fills with a dozen animal cries
The Plexiglas on several chambers vibrates as if angry animals were slamming against it
But still, no animals are seen
Above each chamber,   display revealing heat signatures of the various animals, but they remain invisible to the naked eye
taps on a sheet of Plexiglas which seals off another seemingly empty cage
Isabelle
The woodchips on the floor shift and suddenly the Plexiglas steams up right in front of Matt s face
The Plexiglas begins to shake violently
(cont d) Calm down baby
Calm down
It s okay
Matt takes a pair of thermal goggles from his belt and pulls them down over his eyes
-  rather large heat signature, ape-like in shape, rattles about the cage
Matt slowly unlatches the Plexiglas door and reaches inside
(cont d) It s okay, baby
It s okay
m not going to hurt you
Come here
- he reaches out to the creature
He grabs hold of it, firmly
Stroking it
The creature
Matt reaches for a hypo and brings it up to the creature
(cont d) Just hold still
Something clamps down on his hand, breaking his skin
Blood erupts in a bite pattern
(cont d) Ow, shit
Matt drops the hypo and falls back
The cage door flies open and something runs out
Matt pulls himself up to see the heat signature running down the hallway
He turns around to see another heat signature coming at him
Matt pulls off his goggles to see Linda coming up the Corridor
You okay
She bit me
Yeah
She s become a lot more aggressive in the last few days
Linda takes the goggles from Matt
(cont d) Go take care of that bite
ll get her
And give you a chance to pull ahead
Never
Linda opens a lock-box at the end of the hallway and pulls out a two tranquilizer guns
She hands one to Matt
slight distortion shimmers as something runs past us
We hear  and
Looking down the shadowy corridor, we hear grunting and a haunting heavy breathing
The control door is closed though and something large and angry is throwing itself against it
We can t see anything
few moments later, Linda and Matt round the corner, wearing goggles and leveling their pistols
(ala Porky) Shh
Be vewy, vewy quiet
m hunting simians
heheheheh
Knock it off
(soothing voice) Isabelle
- Dark hallway
Movement
red shimmering heat signature
It comes running at Linda
Linda fires
- flies
Thwack
It stops in mid-air
Then falls
But it doesn t hit the floor
Instead, it stops inches above the ground
- the heat signature lies in a heap at Linda s feet
Good shootin , Tex
What s that make it
m still ahead
6 to 5
Like a smug gunfighter, Linda blows imaginary smoke from the top of her tranquilizer gun
But  m catching up
- The elevator doors open and Sebastian steps out
He s met by  , early thirties, a fiery red-head
Can  have a word
Most normal people say good morning
Don t you think you should test the protocol on the liver samples before you inject Isabelle
How many tissue samples have we successfully regressed
Hundreds, right
How many have gone on to work on the full system
None
That s beside the point
No, that is the point
m not going to waste six months of my life on an outmoded testing procedure
This thing works
know it
feel it
Linda comes down the corridor, listening in on the tail end of the conversation
Fine
You can mop up afterward
You think  m going to kill Isabelle
Kill
More like liquefy
Sarah, thank you for your opinion, but m the project leader
Understand
She says
Yes, Sir
but somehow it feels like  Fuck you
She storms off
Sebastian turns to Linda
How did you ever convince me to hire her
You said you wanted the beat vet in the country
Yeah, well she cares more about the animals than the research
Maybe that s why she s so good
: :  as he shuts off the spinning cyclotron
As it s spinning slows to a halt, he pops the top and reaches in, removing
Sebastian peers at the vial
Who da Man
You da Man
As we pull out we see we are
- Almost feels like a dungeon
Think high-tech Frankenstein
Walls lined with video displays, technical readouts, bizarre medical equipment
On a table in the middle of the room, a sheet drapes over a humanoid form, strapped down at it s invisible limbs
The straps move slightly
ghostly
Wires lead from the body to lots of machinery
Protocol is hot
Vitals
Sarah, checks over the various readouts
heartbeat, blood pressure, the rest
Normal
, the late thirties lab assistant, wheels in a cart of equipment
Linda taken a seat by the table and pushes aside the sheet
How many times do  have to tell you, Frank you aren t God
(beat) am
() Sorry, Boss
Forgot
Sebastian glance up at a glass booth overlooking the Laboratory floor
in the booth
You guys ready to roll
, early thirties, and tech expert , early twenties, man a small booth above the lab
They re dressed more like band roadies than scientists
The room is crammed with electronic and recording equipment
handful of monitors display different images of the lab
Thermal and regular video
Another screen monitors vital signs
We are live and in color
On your mark
Frank and Janice looks down on their colleagues
Sebastian nods their way
Okay
Roll  em
Okay
We are rolling record on videos one through twelve
Frank hits a series of buttons and speaks into a microphone
Recording
- Frank s voice echoes through the chamber
(
) Subject Isabelle Two
Currently in phase shift
one hundred twenty six days, eighteen hours
Testing De-Phase protocol
Injecting serial protein Caine One Two Five
Linda removes a glowing vial of orange liquid from a centrifuge nearby
Maybe if you stopped naming them after yourself, you d have better luck
Why thank you, Dr
Kensington, for that keen scientific observation
ll be sure to include it in my memoirs
whole mention
And  thought  was just gonna be a footnote
Matt unwraps a hypodermic needle and jabs the needle into the vial, drawing up the colored liquid
Okay
Frank and Janice monitor Isabelle s vitals
- Tension in the air
(to Linda) Ready
She wraps a bungee cord around nothing and pulls it tight
She then takes some dye and sprays it
surface appears, floating beneath the restraints
It sheens in the light as Linda searches for a vein
She slaps the surface several times
small bulge appears, like a vein
Propped
Let s make some history
Matt lowers the hypo to the vein
But Sebastian takes the hypo from Matt s hand
Nice try, Sparky
Matt relinquishes the needle
Come on, Isabelle
You can do this
Sebastian lowers the hypo
The skin bonds and gives
The needle remains in sight after it slips through the visible surface
Matt presses down on the hypo plunger, releasing a dye into his bloodstream
The gold liquid twists into a long snaking tube up and down the limb
It s the shape of a vein
The liquid begins to react
Small flashes of light blip up and down the strand of color
Ba-bump
ba-bump
the heartbeat starts to speed up
Elevated heartbeat
Janice analyzes the screens
We re still in the green
Confirmed
Vitals still in the normal range
The glowing liquid turns from gold to red as the complex webbing of a bloodstream appears
It s reacting
Spreading out from the bloodstream, soon becomes visible
the shadow of a skeletal system
Do you see this
It s working
It s actually working
Matt pulls the sheet back
Muscles are beginning to appear
And eyeballs
Frightened eyeballs
Heart rate s up
She s scared
Sarah soothes her
(cont d) It's okay, baby
It's okay
Subject began manifesting almost Immediately
Protocol is reacting quickly
Isabelle starts to struggle against her restraints
She begins to howl
Subject may be in pain or extreme discomfort
Goddamnit
Blood pressure elevating
Brain activity going through the roof
The brain appears, seemingly growing from the inside out
The shape of a large half-formed monkey grows from the inside out
howling in pain, in horror
(cont d) We ve got a problem
What
What problem
Sarah checks her monitors
It s her heart
We can see the heart beating in the ape s (
0
) got an erratic heart beat
She s going into cardiac arrest
Got the crash cart
Carter charges the crash cart and rolls it in
We re losing her
Her machine flatlines
No
It s got to work
The body is only half there
It looks as if its caught in decomposition
Linda rubs the cardiac paddles together
Clear
Linda slams the paddles on the monkey s chest
The jolt of electricity makes the monkey visible again for a brief moment
Then the skin and flesh fade away again
We ve got something
The heartbeat starts up again
The body continues its march toward,visibility
(cont d) Still
erratic
Come on Isabelle
Come on
You can do it
You can fucking do it
Everybody s pulling for her
Come on, monkey
Do it
Do it
Come on
Muscles spread like a rash on bone as the monkey twists and turns, frightened
Then skin
The monkey howls
Skin forms over the muscles reappearing like it was being painted on before our eyes
Stabilizing
The entire form glows, then blinks, then glows again, as if it was discharging some stored energy
(
0
) Brain activity returning to normal
The monkey grunts and groans
Blinks its eyes
Linda hovers over it stroking its fur
Welcome back, Isabelle
Sebastian puts his hand on Linda s shoulder
a move that does not go unnoticed by Matt
We did it
(beat) How is she
(surprised) think she s gonna be okay : Frank, Matt, Sarah, Janice and Linda watch Isabelle rise and walk about the cage
She goes over to the other monkeys and joins in their grooming rituals
Amazing
She's normal, absolutely healthy
If you didn't know any better, you'd think nothing had happened to her
(ribbing Sarah) Yeah
can't wait to slice up her brain and trace her neural pathways
Screw you, Matt
Well maybe not right away
We should celebrate
- The fanciest one in
The entire eight person team sits around a round table, drunk and laughing, as the last champagne flute is filled
Sebastian raises his glass
To the finest research team 've ever known
round of "Hear, hears" and they all clink glasses and drink
- The din of the diners fades away as Linda slips out onto the restaurant's balcony
She find Sebastian leaning against a railing, breathing in the night air
Hey
thought you'd gone
Where would  go
He looks out over the sweep of the city, the twinkling lights of
and darkness of the Potomac river
(cont'd) Twenty years ago there were no computers, no fax machines, no cell phones
was just wondering what the world will be like twenty years from now
if what we're doing will change everything
little " am become death
the shatterer of worlds"
Something like that
Since the day  met, all you wanted to do was change the world
She puts her hand on his shoulder
(cont'd) Listen,  know we've
mean
well just want you to know how proud am of you
know it probably doesn't mean a lot
Actually it does
(beat) guess since you were there from the beginning, you know me better than anyone else on this godforsaken planet
You're positively maudlin
You should be happy
Do you have any idea what you've accomplished
Yeah
but  was working so hard, didn't realize 'd have no one to share it with
Sebastian heads back inside
But he stops and turns back
(cont'd) don't suppose we could turn back the clock for a night and you could come home with me
Her look says it all
Too much water under the bridge
(cont'd) Right
Sorry
Too much champagne
He turns and heads back into the party
As he heads in he passes Matt heading out
He and Sebastian exchange "Heys"
What was that about
Nothing
It's just
He is who he is
Sometimes  just have to be reminded
: - Sebastian wanders through the empty hallways of the laboratory
- Sebastian paces back and forth, examining the habitats
He taps on the Plexiglas of one
The cubicle explodes with We see the Plexi steam up in one part, as if something was breathing on it
As if a nose were pressed against it
(a little drunk) What's it like
Talk goddamnit
Tell me what it's like
: - Flying over Washington
, we cross the Potomac and circle the five-cornered building, looking particularly gloomy on this grey day
(
0
) Six years ago, this committee commissioned me with a very specific task
- At the table are six men
handful of senior military brass and top civilian advisors direct their attention to the front of the room, where Sebastian, flanked by Matt and Linda, is in the middle of his presentation
To successful phase-shift a human being out of quantum sync with the visible universe and then return him safely, with no after affects
Next to Sebastian a video shows a small monkey shifting from the visible spectrum
It's hair, skin, organs and skeletons slowly dissolve before our eyes
(cont'd) Well, we found out sending them to "never-never-land" was easy, it's the getting back that's hard
Sebastian fast forwards a few moments until the video screen shows the bizarrely tangled heap of flesh and bone that used to be alive
(cont'd) Every time we've tried to bring a test subject back from phase-shift
Cellular bonds would dissolve, the primary  strands would decay
But now
Sebastian pauses
Something's bothering him
(cont'd) But now
One of the senior advisers,
, distinguished 50s, finally breaks the silence
But now
Linda and Matt look up at Sebastian expectantly
(') But now
(pause) But now, we feel we are closer than ever to resolving this issue
We've been experimenting with a new regression formula that looks rather promising
leans forward
How long
Sir
Son, as you can imagine, we are very anxious to field test this tactical asset
How long till you resolve this issue
Linda starts to speak, but Sebastian cuts her off with a look
Shouldn't be more than another year, Sir
Frustrated sighs all around the room
(cont'd) Maybe sooner
- As Linda, Matt and Sebastian head to their cars
Yo
Reality check
What the hell was that about
Keep your voice down
The protocol works
Why'd you tell them it didn't
wasn't ready for them to know
But they're the oversight committee
They're supposed to know
'm sure he had a reason
(firmly) You did have a reason, didn't you, Sebastian
had more than a reason
had a goddamn epiphany
They reach his Porsche
(cont'd) What do you think they'd do if they know we could send a subject into phase shift and pull it back out again
How many seconds would it take for them to take over the whole project, bringing in their soldiers to test the formula on
We'd have lost control of it by the end of the week
It's their money, Sebastian
It's going to happen eventually
know
But not yet
There's too much for us to learn
don't want my hands tied by their political agenda when we go to phase three
Well, then
mind telling us how you're gonna get a human test-subject for phase three without the committee finding out
That's easy
've decided to test the procedure
- on myself
The team sits around the conference table
Their jaws drop and they stare at him with wide eyes
Are you nuts
Was Jonas Salk nuts
Yeah
Pretty sure he was
And remember, for every Jonas Salk, there are a bunch of guys who aren't famous cuz they died
If we're that unsure, how can we morally justify testing it on someone else
Isn't it a little soon to be moving into phase three anyway
She's right
We haven't even finished collating the phase two research
We'll have plenty of time to collate and cross-reference later
Monkey data doesn't matter anyway
The only real data is human data
You don't even know if any of the protocols will work on humans
How are we gonna find out
Besides, we've succeeded with a gorilla and their  is 98% the same as humans
And the 2% is not that significant
Sebastian
humans can talk, build houses and cook in microwave ovens
Gorilla's live in trees
That's a helluva 2% if you ask me
We're all concerned
know that
But if we're gonna move forward ever, this is something we have to do
Why you
Why not one of us
The risks
couldn't ask
(interrupting) What if we volunteer
What if you're too valuable to lose
'm Project Leader
It's my formula and my call
The best way to express your concern is to make damn sure you do your best work
'll want about four weeks to
To put your affairs in order
To run some more reversions and tissue tests and then we'll attempt the phase shift
'll stay shifted for three days of testing and then we'll perform a quantum regression
' knock on the door
Come in
Linda pushes into the room and closes the door behind her
(cont'd) What
In the past six years, 've never once challenged your decisions, but this Sebastian
don't think you should do this
You don't understand
Oh please
How long were we together
You must've said it a million times Nobody knows who built the lunar lander
All they remember in the first man on the moon
Sebastian shrugs and nods
(cont'd) But what if something happens to you
what about the project
Sebastian smiles
Lin, trust me
nothing's going to happen
- Linda and Matt are in bed together
Matt kisses her way up and down her arm
But Linda is distracted
He refuses to listen to reason
Can we talk about this later
'm trying to make love to you
Sorry
just can't let it go
Matt props himself up on the pillow
know how you're feeling
Hell, he and 've been friends since freshman year
So how can we let him do this
What if you were given the opportunity to be the first person on ,Mars, would you go
In a heartbeat
What if they didn't know whether or not they could get you home
Linda thinks about it
It's still tempting
(cont'd) This is his chance to be Chuck Yeager or Christopher Columbus
Well, if were him 'd do the same thing
Matt goes back to kissing Linda
Let me ask another question
Is about who gets to be on top
Is the human race really ready for what we're doing
Matt groans and rolls over
Why do you always get philosophical before we're about to get physical
No really
Is it ready
We're barrelling down a road that begs moral and ethical questions that  don't think we can answer
They said the same thing about the bomb
They said we'd never survive the nuclear age
but here we are
This night is still young
(beat) mean, when you think about it, it's creepy
Do we really want to live in a world where people can just disappear in the blink of an eye
We made our deal with the devil years ago
Might as well stick around to cash in
- Sebastian stripped to his shorts paces nervously
knock on the door
(his voice catches) Yes
Matt sticks his head in
We're ready
Sebastian nervously shakes his limbs out
Then nods
Okay
It's not too late to back out
'm happy to take your place
No
'm ready
Matt leads him into the hallway
- As they walk down the corridor toward the lab
Nervous
little
Ever tell you the one about Superman and Wonder Woman
don't think so
So Superman's flying around the city, and he's horny as hell
Lo and behold he looks down and sees Wonder Woman, completely nude, sunning herself up on the roof of the Justice League
mean she is lying there naked and spread eagle
So Superman starts thinking, "man
this is too easy
could go down there, do a little fast pumping and be gone before she even sees me
" After all he is faster than a speeding bullet, right
Anyway, he swoops down, takes care of business so quick, you can't even see him
Well
tell ya
Wonder Woman looks up, surprised as hell and says "What the hell was that
" And the Invisible Man replies " dunno know, but it sure hurt like hell
" Sebastian shoots Matt a look
You know, that could be the last joke ever hear
'mon, man
That's funny shit
The buzz of conversation is punctuated by an amplified , thumping its familiar rhythm
Bah-bump
Bah-bump
In the center of the room, Sebastian, dressed only in a pair of jogging shorts is strapped to a table inclined at a 45 degree angle
Electrodes are strapped to his body
An
tube snakes from the needle in his vein up to a bag of saline solution
Dripping slowly
Linda makes last minute checks of some of the equipment
She pats Sebastian on the shoulder
How're you feeling
Sebastian takes a deep breath
Fine
Sarah checks his vitals
Pulse 88,  140 over 95
bit elevated
To be expected
No reason for concern
He's ready
Linda takes a moment and studies Sebastian's face
She's almost teary eyed
Hey
it's gonna be okay
Linda nods
Back to business
Start recording
Janice hits record on the equipment decks
We're hot
All systems nominal, Houston
Frank coordinates all the data being fed into the computers
He pushes a series of buttons and speaks into a microphone
Okay, kids
Let's make some history
- Frank's voice echoes through the chamber
Subject: Male, Age 29, weight 166 lbs
Matt jabs a hypodermic into small vial of colored liquid
Draws up 20ccs
(to Linda) Ready
Linda takes the hypo from Matt
(cont'd) If the tests are any indication it should work quickly
'll inject myself
If anything goes wrong, they can't blame you
She hands the hypo Sebastian and steps away
Sebastian stares at the golden formula silently for a moment
We can still shut down, Sebastian
He shakes his head
Any last words
Yeah
If 'm killed, pretend  said something deep and clever
Then
Back to business
He inserts the needle into the Sebastian
Presses into himself and depresses the plunger
Injection was administered at (checks watch) 18:23:47
The colored liquid snakes it's way into his bloodstream
(cont'd) Keep talking
Tell us what you're feeling
Nothing so far
Vitals are stable
They wait and watch
Nothing's happening
Another moment passes by
Human  structure is slightly more complex
it's possible that it may take more time
Another moment passes
Maybe we overlooked something
Recheck the protocol
It can't be non- reactive
Kinda like a firecracker with a bad fuse
Sebastian shoots Carter a questioning look
(cont'd) Don't know if it'll go off
Frank
(
0
) (from the booth) No change in bio-electric
Goddammit
Another long pause
Sebastian concentrates
(cont'd) Okay wait, my arm
it's getting a bit warm
yeah, it's
it's starting to tingle
Excitement overtakes the room
(cont'd) Okay
it's spreading to my back
like, like a fever
Here we go
Slowly the flesh on Sebastian's arm begins dissolving, revealing the complex network of nerves, blood vessels and flesh beneath it
Shit
it's starting to burn
Oh god
It hurts
didn't think it would hurt
The   thumps faster, accelerating Heartbeat's elevated
Pulse at 100
130
What do you feel
Keep talking Pain
Pulse is 165
170 Blood pressure 180 over 100
He's going to blow out his heart
Prop the crash cart
Carter grabs the crash cart, rolls it in
Matt tears off the
leads into Sebastian's arms
We've got to stop it
We can't
All the monitors are going crazy
Something's happening
Frank leans into the microphone
Listen up
Electric activity increasing in all limbs
Brainwaves are through the roof
didn't think the human brain could spike that high
Maybe it can't
Sebastian screams in dire pain
He struggles against his restraints as his skin liquefies into a muscular mass
It's like something's eating away at him
Gruesome
The yells become louder and more painful to hear
No
Oh god
The muscular system begins to dissolve, leaving a struggling skeleton wrapped with tentacular blood vessels and stuffed with the major organs
The beating heart, the heaving lungs
Pulse is 180
holding stable
Screaming
Then the organs go
Then the blood vessels
Leaving only a skeleton howling in pain
The jawbones spread wide
Screaming
screaming
Holy shit
Then as if someone had poured acid all over the bones, the skeleton evaporates into nothingness
Pulse is dropping
170
150
160
There is  left of Sebastian Caine
Bio-quantum phase shift occurred at 18:26
The screaming continues and the restraints continue to twist and turn
Suddenly the restraints go limp
Is he dead
Linda checks the readouts
No
He passed out from the trauma
Vitals returning to normal
Pulse 110 dropping
Blood pressure 130 over 75
long beat as everybody's eyes stare at the instruments
(
) Electrical activity is stabilizing
Pulse steady at 70
long beat
Un-fucking-believable
reverent pause as Linda runs her fingers over what would be his skin
Small electrical charge dance around her fingertips
She gasps
(whispers in his ear) You did it, Sebastian
You're the first
Let's get him into recovery
: The chamber is half constructed out of Plexiglas at the end of the Hallway of Habitats
On the recovery bed, a sheet drapes over Sebastian's invisible body
The gentle bleatings of medical machinery pound out a dulling rhythm
Linda sleeps in a corner chair as Matt slips into the room
He checks the readouts on Sebastian then takes a seat by Linda
She wakes with a start
'okay
You nodded off
His breathing's hypnotic
How long's it been
Seventeen hours
Where are the others
In the lab crunching numbers
We've got enough data there for two lifetimes of research
Linda rubs her temples and gestures to the bed
keep looking at that hole, wondering if he's really there
She notices something out of the corner of his eye
The sheet twitches
(cont'd) Did you see
The sheet twitches again
He may be coming out of it
Linda and Matt watch intently
Then suddenly
the sheets thrash violently
yell of pain
' The lights
Turn off the goddamn lights
Ah Christ
Linda jumps up and crosses to Sebastian
Matt rushes to the wall and turns off the lights
Darkness
The room is lit by the glow of machinery
'  (cont'd) can't
can't close my eyes can't close my eyes
Your eyelids are transparent
The sheets slowly stop thrashing
' So
'm
Yes
' My arms
can
where
can feel them
Your arms
your whole body
It worked, Sebastian
It worked
The sheet rises and slips away
The wires, seemingly connected to thin air, spread out like a spider's web and then fall away one-by-one
The monitors all go dead
' Mirror
want to see
Over here in the corner
Matt motions to a dark corner of the room, toward a mirror and sink
We push in on the mirror
No reflection
Suddenly it fogs up
Sebastian's breath
finger tracing appears in the fog
but of course we see no finger
The sink faucet twists on and water runs
It cups into the shape of hands and lifts into the air, splashing against the surface of Sebastian's face
Beads of water cling to his f ace, outlining it  shape f or a moment before dripping away
(cont'd) What was it like
' It's hard to think
Sebastian's voice is now behind him
Matt turns around
'  (cont'd) The transformation
remember every molecule in my body shattering
It was painful
' At first
but then everything went black
couldn't see or hear or feel anything
It was all just black
like  wasn't connected
Your system received quite a shock
' At least my senses are starting to return
You're wearing your Shalimar, aren't you
Linda realizes that he's standing very close by
Her hair lifts slightly and Sebastian inhales
Chills go down her spine
Sebastian
Linda's hair drops back to her shoulders
' This is weird
'm looking through myself at the floor
'm looking right through myself
can't tell
He bumps into a chair
'  (cont'd) where my body is
moment of silence
Sebastian
No answer
Linda and Matt look at each other, slightly alarmed
Sebastian
An indentation forms on the bed a moment later
' You really can't see me
Can you
Gimme symptoms
Dizziness, nausea, headache, body-ache, disorientation
' No, just tired
(beat) It's funny
can see everything
more than before
but  can't see myself
- Carter, Frank, Janice and Sarah work at various research stations
The door opens and Linda and Matt enter
Hey
How's he doing
Why don't you ask him
Linda motions to the gap between her and Matt
The four of them stare at the nothing
Sebastian, how do you feel
' Not to bad, considering
They turn round
The voice is coming from behind them
The group rises from their various workstations and turn toward where the voice came from
'  (cont'd) Odd, isn't it
rheostat switch on the wall turns and the lights dim
Though it's a simple act, it feels somewhat ominous
He can't close his eyes so they're sensitive to light
Linda's explanation puts everyone at ease
So, what was it like
' Over here
Sebastian has moved
As everyone turns toward him again, he can't stifle a slight giggle
'mon Sebastian
Knock it off
' Sorry
Couldn't resist
His voice again come s from somewhere else in the room
feel like we're playing Marco Polo
Well,  see the procedure hasn't changed your personality
Frank pulls on a pair of
No worries
'm on it
- Every body in the laboratory shows up as a heat signature, including Sebastian
Frank points
(cont'd) Gotcha, big man
- The   reaches for a chair
' Boy, you people have no sense of humor
chair slides back from a desk and bends under Sebastian's weight
'  (cont'd) Show me
So
: - Frank and Janice shuttle the playback controls as a re-plays various angles of Sebastian's phase shift
' Stop there
Frank halts the tape
'  (cont'd) Index that
That was when it started burn
Epidermal reaction
Index Mark
112125
Janice scribble the numbers in her notebook
Linda crosses, nursing a cup of coffee
It's late
Time you got some rest
' Just a little longer
Hate to pull rank, but you're my patient now and you need rest
We've got a busy day tomorrow
Heavy sigh
' Fine
- As Linda enters she points to a small camera in the upper corner of the room
We've set up a thermal camera for observation and 've arranged one of us to be here 24/7 in case you need anything
The team's gonna be on alpha- call alert for the duration
If anything goes wrong, we can all be here within
' Thirty minutes
Yes,,_I know
wrote the procedure
was trying to be reassuring
' You like this don't you
What's that
' Being in charge
It's clear she does
But she's certainly not going to admit it
Please
'm just doing my job
: :  video screen
thermal lump lays stretched out on the bed
Pull back to reveal  staring at the screen
We are
- bank of monitors display the various angles of the Hall of Habitats, the laboratory and, of course, Sebastian in the recovery room
Linda hands Sarah a cup of coffee
You gonna be okay
Fine
It's not like  have anything else going on in my sad pathetic life
Carter'll be in at six to spell you and 'll be in by nine
Call me if anything happens, okay
Through the glass wall, Linda sees Matt knocking and waving her out
'm fine
Go on ahead
- The rest of the team straggles into the elevator
Yawning
Exhausted from the day
Man, 'm tired
That was a long day
Days only get longer from here
Linda catches Matt's eye
Gives him a look
"You coming over
" Matt nods, "yes", imperceptible to everyone but Linda
She smiles
: - Deserted and dark
- Late
Sarah rubs her temples
Her eyelids are heavy
She's having real trouble staying awake
The buzzing fluorescent light isn't helping either
- The sheets ruffle and the indentation disappears from the bed
We can hear breathing and soft sound of bare feet shuffling against linoleum
toward the door, as if we, are following someone walking
The door handle turns and the door pushes open
- the Hallway of the Habitats
We hear the sounds of sleeping creatures
couple of them growl at something unseen
The growling follows the invisible something as it passes by
- The laboratory door opens and shuts again
Ghostly
We see papers shuffling at one of the work stations
glass moves slightly
- Sarah reclines in her chair
Fast asleep, Behind her is the glass wall, revealing the empty hallway behind it
But a small portion of the glass fogs, as if someone had just breathed on it
As the fogged part quickly clears, we see the door to the observation room quietly open
, still sleeping
We hear a whisper
' (whispering) Sarah
Are you awake
Her heavy breathing mixes with Sebastian's
'  (cont'd) (barely audible) Hmm
Sarah's hair moves slightly, as if a hand were running through it
And then we see her shirt move, like fingers were tracing over it
Down from the shoulder to her breast
Around her nipple
Sarah moans slightly, as if she were dreaming, but she doesn't stir
And then her breasts cup slightly, as if they were being touched
softly
gently
Her breathing becomes harder, more labored, erotic
and then she
Bar eyes wide with fear
She jumps and cups her own breasts and looks around the room
It's empty, of course
She jumps over to the monitor and checks on Sebastian's room
The heat signature isn't there
Dr
Caine
Goddamnit, Dr
Caine
Are you in here
She listens
It's silent
She tries holding her breath, listening for his breathing
But there's nothing
Sarah reaches over to a microphone
Hits a few switches
(cont'd) Dr
Caine
- (
0
,) Dr
Caine, please report in
- (
0
,) Dr
Caine, report in please
- Sarah waits
No response
Shit
She looks around the room
He must be in here
(cont'd) Dr
Caine
Sebastian
Come on, this isn't funny
know you're in here
Nothing
No response
Sarah waves her hand around, reaching out, trying to find him
After a few beats she stops and rubs her head
(cont'd) must be going crazy
Suddenly, Sarah gets an idea
She quickly exits the observation room
- At a wall storage box, she removes a pair of Thermal Goggles and slips them on
- Sarah enters wearing the thermals
She scans the room
- The room is empty
She pulls the goggles off in frustration, and when she glances over at the video screen, she sees Sebastian's thermal image lying on the bed in the recovery room
Sarah sinks into her chair, a tad disconcerted
- Linda and Matt finish listening to Sarah's story
found him later in the lab, running samples
Why didn't you call me
Because  wasn't sure
'm still not
mean,  could've easily been dreaming
It doesn't sound like something Sebastian would do
God,  feel so stupid
can talk to him
No
mean
(she torn, unsure of herself) It was probably nothing shouldn't've mentioned it
You sure
Yeah, 'm sure
mean, y'know, why would he do that, right
Just, this place at night can be kinda creepy, y'know
- Sebastian, wearing surgical scrubs sits in an examination chair
Wire leads sprout from the electrodes covering his head and arms
The electrodes seem to outline his body
So, how was your first night
' Restless
Hard to sleep when you can't close your eyes
As Sebastian talks, we can see the electrodes around his jaw pump up and down
Yeah
What'd you do
' Got up a couple of times
Knocked about
Yeah, Sarah mentioned you weren't in your cubicle
She said she called you over the intercom and you didn't respond
guess  didn't hear
had the radio on
It'd be helpful to us if you'd tell whoever's on duty where you're going to
mean, if something were to happen, we'd want to know where to find you
didn't think it was a problem
It isn't
just don't want it to become one
Machines pump out ,  readouts
Matt studies them
(cont'd) Readings are normal
' Next  want to run a  and analysis of the platelets
We'll have to draw some more blood
: Sarah rolls up Sebastian's sleeve, revealing empty air
She wraps a bungee cord around the nothing, pulls it tight and sprays the inside of his elbow with dye
She acts very self conscious
' You okay
Yeah
Why
You just seem a little nervous
No
'm fine
Hold still
This might hurt a bit
The surface of his skin sheens in the light as Linda searches for a vein
She slaps his arm several times, then plunges a hypodermic needle into his skin
His skin bends and gives
The needle remains in sight after it slips through the visible surface
Sarah presses down on the hypo plunger, releasing a dye into his bloodstream
(cont'd) Dr
Caine
this might sounds stupid, but are you
are you looking at me
The red dye twists into a long snaking red tube up and down his arm
His vein
' No
was looking at the clock
Why
Sarah draws the plunger back, sucking Sebastian's blood into the hypodermic and then yanks the needle out
Just felt like someone was staring at me
Sarah pulls the vial off the needle and labels it with a grease pencil
After a few beats the red dye in Sebastian's blood stream dissolves and disappears, as does the liquid in the vial
slides Sebastian's sheet covered frame into an

takes  , seemingly all by itself
Across the table, Matt leans back and topples his acknowledging defeat
Dim lights
Janice and Frank both don eye guards
Frank switches on a low intensity laser on and it's beam shoots across the room
The beam distorts slightly in the center of the room
As Frank widens the spectral pattern, suddenly the beam splits into a million different spectral rainbows, momentary illuminating Sebastian's entire frame in a glowing tingle of light
pulls vials from the cyclotrons and props blood sample slides
She slips them under the microscope
She takes a sip of her Diet Coke and puts it on the table
She pears into the microscope and analyses the blood sample, squeezing more stain onto it
She looks up to make notations, but when she reaches for her Diet Coke '
She looks around
It's on the other side of her microscope
She shrugs it off, she takes a sip and sets it down where it was before
She peers into the microscope again and when she looks up
the Diet Coke is gone
She looks around the room and sees it on another table completely
Sebastian
Goddamnit
We hear Sebastian's laughter echo in the room
' You've no idea how much fun 've had
'm going to hate going back
That's what worries me
' How so
What happens when we turn the project over to the Army
Ever wonder how much fun they're gonna have
' Maybe we won't give it to them
His voice comes from behind her now
We see indentations on her shoulders where his fingers press down
'  (cont'd) was thinking
tonight's my last night
Ever fantasize about making love to an invisible man
Linda pulls away from him
Stop it, Sebastian
It's not funny
' Well, don't do it for me
Do it for science
Linda walks away
Sebastian laughs
Grow up
' Oh well
Missed your big chance
Got some sleep
Big day tomorrow
- bevy of activity below us as the scientists prepare
Matt slides the antigen cocktail into the centrifuge and starts it spinning
sheet drapes over a Sebastian's frame, straps across his limbs
He is fully wired
Linda looks up to the observation booth
Recording
Frank peers down at her from the booth, his voice echoing through the chamber
Recording
Subject Doctor Sebastian Caine
Currently in phase shift
Three days, seven hours
De-Phase protocol
Injecting Serial Protein Caine One Two Seven
Matt removes the glowing vial of orange liquid from a centrifuge nearby
Carter hands Matt a hypo
Matt jabs it into the vial, drawing up the colored liquid
Linda sprays Sebastian's arm with dye
(cont'd) Ready
Not really
was just starting to enjoy myself
Tough
Okay, man
Here we go
Matt inserts the hypo into the vein and presses down on the plunger
The liquid begins to react
Small flashes of light blip up and down the strand of color outlining the vein
Ba-bump
ba-bump
the heartbeat starts to speed up
' Wait
something
something doesn't feel right
Heartbeat elevated
Janice and Frank look over the equipment
Vitals still nominal
The glowing liquid turns from gold to red as the complex webbing of a bloodstream appears
Spreading out from the bloodstream, soon becomes visible the shadow of a skeletal system
can't br

Sebastian begins wheezing
What's wrong
He's not breathing
Muscles are beginning to appear
And eyeballs
Frightened eyeballs
Subject manifesting
Pulse erratic
Sebastian pulls against his bonds
One set tears off
Carter
Carter grabs onto the mass of flesh and muscle, trying to hold it back
But the restraints snap
The half-visible man is screaming
He grabs Carter and throws him across the room
(cont'd) Sebastian
Sebastian
And just for a second, Sebastian is fully visible
And free
He looks around like a scared animal and rips off all the wiring
(cont'd) Sebastian
Get a tranq
Stat
Sarah preps a tranquilizer
Sebastian locks eyes with Linda
He's lost, he doesn't know where he is
And suddenly, he crumbles to the ground
Linda rushes over to him and puts bar hand on his shoulder
Light bleeds from his skin and his skin begins to dissolve from sight
He's reverting
Got him on the table
Matt, Linda and Sarah pull the shifting body up and onto an operating table
Carter pulls himself up and heads back to the group
(cont'd) Get me a
of
seven
got no pulse
No pulse
Start
Carter locates Sebastian's heart, not a difficult thing because we can actually see it
Carter's hand pushes down in the air inches above the heart
We see the heart being pushed and squeezed
Sarah slaps an air bag on Sebastian and starts pumping air into his lungs
Sebastian's heart begins to beat again, beat on its own
Getting a pulse
Holy shit
What happened
Sebastian
can you hear me
Can you hear me
How are his pupils
can't see his goddamn pupils
think he's going into shock
We slowly   to the sights and sounds of our scientist- doctors working on Sebastian
And the beeping of Sebastian's erratic heartbeat
: The heartbeat continues
In the shadows, two Rhesus Monkeys defend themselves against an unseen attacker
Blood splatters against the Plexiglas wall
We
- Linda stares through the Plexiglas walls into the Recovery Chamber
Inside the Chamber, Sarah and Carter- eye the various screens monitoring Sebastian's vitals
Linda watches the hollow pocket underneath the blanket
She watches the rhythm of its rises and falls as Sebastian sleeps
Matt comes up behind her
Just got the tissue sample results
Cellular cohesion is stable
Linda exhales in relief
Matt puts his hands on her shoulder
Pulls her close to him
(cont'd) How bout you
You gonna be okay
Guess so
(beat) was just thinking about the Apollo missions
'know
Grissom, White and Chaffee
What it was like for them on that launch pad that day, thinking they were gonna reach the stars only to burn to death
Sometimes the test pilots make history
Sometimes the planes crash and people die
But he didn't die, did he
(beat) What if we can't bring him back
What then
It's just a little hitch is all
He'll be the first to tell that he'll crack it and 'm sure he will
It'll just take time
(beat) Listen, let's got out of here
We could drive up to the old observatory
We'll take some wine and go count the stars and forget all this for awhile
She pulls away
No
want to be here for him
Linda pushes through the door of the recovery chamber and takes a seat by Sebastian's bedside
little hurt, Matt heads down the corridor
Frank and Janice are staring into their coffee when Matt enters
Matt crosses to the coffee machine and pours himself a cup
He takes a seat at the table
They all drink their coffee in silent vigil
- Linda sits by Sebastian's bedside, listening to the constant rhythm of the machines
The sheets shift
' (weak) Hey
Hey
So  guess it didn't work
Linda shakes her head
' You look worried
It must've been bad
Sebastian's voice is weak and strained
You almost died
' Well, remember your Nietchze
Whatever doesn't kill me, makes me stronger
Linda smiles
should be making you feel better
Not vice versa
' guess if 'm going to be stuck this way for awhile, 'd better make some adjustments
- In a dusty shaft of light
cotton swab
is dipped by a gloved hand into a jar of flesh-colored cream make-up
We follow the hand as it raises the cotton swab into the darkness
The swab strokes over the black and the rich fleshy cream spreads, revealing
of a closed eye
The eyelids part, unveiling
Blink
Blink
No eye
Not even a trace of a eye socket
Just darkness
floats through mid-air
hovering before the eyelids
It turns and fastens itself to the darkness between the lids
We   slowly as Sebastian lifts a latex and pulls it over his head
He checks his reflection in the mirror
He looks almost human
Almost
face, eyes, hands
the rest of him covered by surgical scrubs
We pull back and see the rest of the team looking on
Not too bad
The latex'll limit the amount of light delivered to my optic nerves
You could almost pass for human
Sebastian rises
He looks eerily removed from reality with his cold blank expression
' Well, it gives you a face to talk to at least, and we can all work in normal light again
- Carter draws blood from Sebastian
Samples are placed into the cyclotron
Matt peers through the eyepiece of a microscope
He makes notes
Frank and Janice finish a computer simulation on a protein strand
Matt looks over
They shake their heads, no
Sebastian slides into the
Linda examines a petri dish
She throws her pencil down in frustration
Sebastian is hit by the spectral radiation beams
Matt pulls a vial of orange liquid from the cyclotron
- Sebastian, still in his latex and scrubs, but looking like he's been dragged through the nine levels of purgatory, is escorted back to the recovery chamber by Linda and Matt
He crosses to his bed and collapses on it
Closes his eyes
The testing's making me sick
Could be the barium or the radiation
You're physiology has changed and, well, all bets are off
can't believe  have to spend another night here
(to Linda) Suppose you're gonna go home now, meet up with that boyfriend of yours now
Linda and Matt exchange a glance
Linda quickly covers
Do you want me to stay
No
That's okay
It's just, being a guinea pig is more work than thought
'll be fine
- Various shots of the empty hallways and deserted labs
- Carter kicks back in his chair listening to his walkman stereo and playing gameboy
- Sebastian, in scrubs and make-up, paces back and forth
He slams the wall in frustration
He crosses to a mirror and examines himself
He doesn't look half bad
He pokes his cheeks
There's something about him that's a little off, but only if you look close
- shadow falls across Carter's face
He looks up
It's Sebastian wearing street clothes - jeans and a hooded sweatshirt over his latex mask
Carter pulls of his earphones
(surprised) Dr
Caine
What's up
Just stopped by to let you know, 'm going out for a bit
Sebastian turns back into the hallway
Going out
Hey wait a sec
Carter scrambles to his feet
- Carter catches up with Sebastian
What do you mean going out for a bit
If  don't get out of here, 'm gonna go crazy
But you're not supposed to leave the compound
Why not
That's the rule
Yes, but  made that rule
It's my rule and 'm changing it
You can't just change it
Sebastian hits the elevator button
The doors open
Carter,  was suppose to be like this for three days
Three fucking days and 'll be damned if 'm going to spend the rest of my life as a prisoner in this godforsaken dump
Now 'm going out
'll be back in a couple of hours
Okay
The elevator doors close with Sebastian inside
Shit
Shit
Carter runs down the corridor
- Carter picks up the phone and dials
beat then
Yeah, it's Carter
We got a problem
- The elevator doors open and Sebastian pushes past the Marine Guard
Hey, Doc
Haven't seen you for awhile
Sebastian keeps his face turned away as he crosses to his Porsche
Yeah, well
You know how it in sometimes
You got that right, sir
was beginning to worry 'cause your car hadn't moved
Thanks, but everything's cool
Sebastian starts his car
It chugs a few times before turning over and speeding out of the warehouse
- The door opens and Sebastian switches on the lights
He looks around his apartment and sighs
It's good to be home
- Sebastian enters the bedroom, clicking on the light
He looks at the ceiling, "You Should Be Working", and smiles
'  ,   - Linda and Matt each rush to their respective cars
He could be anywhere
Hell he could be right behind us
'll meet you at the lab
'm gonna swing by his place, just in case
See you there
Matt tries to give her a quick pack
Linda backs away
(quietly, looking around) don't want him to see
(looking around too) What a mess
They get in their cars
'  - Sebastian packs up a few personal belongings in an overnight duffle
He crosses to his bookcase and pulls out some books and throws them into the bag
But as he does, he notices a light come on in the window across the courtyard
Sebastian turns off his bedroom light and moves toward the window
He peers across the courtyard into the Brunette's apartment
He watches the Brunette as she comes into the living room from her front hallway
She drops her keys on the table and begins unbuttoning her blouse as she crosses to the window
Just as the blouse slips off her shoulder, she pulls her blinds shut
Shit
Frustrated, Sebastian steps away from the window and then stops
Something has occurred to him
(cont'd) Don't even think it
He looks down and notices his hand is trembling
His breathing is a little heavy
little nervous
He catches a glimpse at himself in the mirror
(cont'd) (almost whispering) Once
just once
The Brunette's living room light switches off and the bathroom light switches on
We see him fighting an internal battle and we see him lose it
He grabs a hold of his hand and peels the latex skin off
- Linda drives Sebastian's apartment
She spots his black Porsche in the parking lot
She pulls over to the curb, jumps out of her car and heads into the building
' ,  - Wearing just a robe, the brunette turns on her shower
The doorbell rings
With a frustrated sigh, the brunette rises
She peers through the peep hole
No one's there
But as she turns she hears the doorbell again
She opens the door, steps out into the hallway and looks around
Empty
Puzzled she heads back inside her apartment
We follow her as she crosses to her bedroom, but a moment later, the bedroom door closes on its own
We hear a  come from the other side
Then another
Then a muffled struggled
And we
: ,   - Linda exits the elevator and heads down to Sebastian's door
She knocks
Waits
No answer
She knocks again
Waits
And then she tries the door
It's unlocked
She pushes the door open
Sebastian
'  - Linda pushes through the living room, into the bedroom
Sebastian
She notices that the bathroom light is on
On the floor she finds Sebastian's clothing and on the vanity she sees his latex face and hands
Oh shit
She scramble for the bedroom phone and quickly dials
(cont'd) Yeah, Matt, it's me
He was here
No
He's taken his make-up off
don't know
He must be outside somewhere
don't know where he went
'm coming back to the lab
How
How'm  supposed to do that
'
We're going on alpha call
want everyone at the lab now
We're gonna need thermal visors and we may need tranqs
As she hangs up the phone, and heads out
The doesn't follow, but instead pushes through the blinds and out the window
As we cross the courtyard, we begin to hear muffled cries of terror
We hold on the Brunette's window as we
: '  - The bedroom door opens and we see the Brunette, nude and curled up on the bed, sobbing
We follow the sounds of heavy breathing to the front door of her apartment
The door opens and we push out into the hallway
We can see indentations of feet appear on the hallway carpet
' The elevator doors open and Linda steps inside
The doors close shut behind her
beat later we see the indentations of footsteps come around the corner
We follow the breathing and stumbling footfalls back into
'  - We push over to the bathroom sink
The faucet turns on and the water starts running
We see the water cup under the faucet and splash against Sebastian's face
His face appears briefly in the water
Then the water slips away
For second it sounds like he's crying, but then we hear something far worse
He's laughing
Nervous laughter
- Matt hands out thermal goggles, while Frank loads and passes out tranquilizer guns
What are the tranqs for
Use your imagination
Are you saying he's dangerous
We're just saying we need to be cautious
The Metro stops running after midnight and he's on foot, so he can't have gotten too far
Look, this isn't a monkey we're talking about
It's Dr
Caine
Don't you think you're over reacting
This program is classified
If he's out there it means someone might find out about him
He could destroy the whole program
' Relax, Linda
No one's gonna find out
They all turn around
At the door is Sebastian, back in his latex outfit
Where the hell have you been
got a little stir crazy, so  went to my apartment to pick up some stuff
Bullshit
went to your apartment and happen to know you did a helluva lot more than pick some stuff up
What are you talking about
You, of all people How could you
Caught dead to rights, Sebastian sinks into his chair
He thinks she knows
(cont'd) You put yourself and this project at risk
Just what did you see in my apartment
saw your face and your clothes
It was bad enough you left without an escort, but to take off the
(he motions to his face) out in public
Sebastian realizes that they don't know
Don't make a mountain out of molehill
didn't let anyone see me
That's not good enough
When you're outside the lab there are a thousand variables none of us can control
It's just not safe for you to be out there
Come on, Linda
You don't expect me to be some kind of prisoner
You volunteered for this, Sebastian
You knew going in there could be consequences
(beat) For the security of this project, 'm gonna have to ask you to confine yourself to the compound
'm still Project Leader, Linda
It's my decision to make
You're right
It's your decision
But if you leave the compound again, 'll notify the oversight committee
Then they can make the decision
You understand
Matt
Sorry, man
You'd do the same if it were the other way around
long beat
Sebastian slowly rises, acknowledges Linda with a nod and leaves the room
Linda looks around at her silent co-workers, the goggles and tranqs still on the table
Pack 'em up
Everyone go home
: - The Lab is buzzing with the usual activity
Linda rolls up Sebastian's sleeve, revealing nothing
Hold still
She wraps a bungee cord around the nothing and pulls it tight
She then sprays the inside of his elbow with dye
(contentious) How much blood do you think you've taken so far
The surface of his skin sheens in the light as Linda searches for a vein
She slaps his arm several times, then plunges a hypodermic needle into his skin
Not enough to worry about
Every day
feels like you're sucking me dry
Linda presses down on the hypodermic plunger, releasing a dye into his bloodstream
(cont'd) It's funny
All these years 've known you,  never pegged you for a megalomanic
What are you talking about
The shoe being on the other foot
You getting to run things
didn't ask for this, Caine
But when a classified experiment disappears in the middle of the night, someone's gotta run the show
(tries sympathy) Look,  know how hard this has been for you
He knocks her arm away and pulls the hypo, out of his arm
Don't patronize me
(beat) And for the record, you've got no idea what it's like
get up every morning and you people stick needles in me
You bombard me with radiation until vomit
And then at six it's over for you
You get to go home
But Sebastian is still here
Sebastian can't leave, or else
That's the worst part, you know
Here  have this
this and  can't even use it
Now it's a gift
You're goddamn right it's a gift
And if you weren't so goddamned short sighted, 'd be out there right now trying to master it
Sebastian looks around at the other scientists staring at him
He tosses the hypo with the needle onto the instrument tray and heads toward the door
Where're you going
Looks like 'm going nowhere
Come on, man
We've got a ton of tests scheduled today
Do them yourself
- Linda enters to find Sebastian reading the collected works of
Elliot
Want to talk about it
No
Linda looks over his shoulder
"We are the hollow men, the stuffed men, headpieces filled with straw
" Funny, huh
've become a literal metaphor
He puts the books down
don't want to fight you
just want what's best for the program
know
And you being right doesn't make it any easier for me
You can be scared
That's okay
'm not scared of being stuck this way
With a little more make-up and practice,  could
(he motions to his face) pass
'know, get by in the world
But the testing
You're talking like you've given up
It's only been a few months
What if it's years
don't know how much more testing  can take
- Sebastian paces back and forth, glancing at the camera
- Linda, Matt and Sebastian, in latex and scrubs, stare at an electron microscope's video display
On the screen in a sparse colony of blood calls but every second more and more cells appear, filling the gap
60% reversion
70%
75%
80%
85
The others in the lab listen
They start to get excited
Janice and Carter leave their research and come over to watch the screen
We've got it
We've got it
93%
95%
95% They wait
Linda points to a blank patch on the screen
That's all we need
Come on, baby
Come on
But the blood cells nearest the blank patch twinkle out existence, and then those around them also blink away until after a beat, the screen is empty
Full quantum cascade at 95%
(beat) 'm sorry
You're sorry
You're fucking sorry
Sebastian picks up a glass beaker and hurls it against the wall
It shatters
(cont'd) Six weeks of this shit and you're sorry
He grabs more equipment and begins tossing it in a rage
Carter and Janice grab him and restrain him
After struggling against them a beat or two, Sebastian calms down and pushes away from them and heads out the door
don't blame him
'll go talk to him
Leave him alone
He just needs to blow off some steam
- : Sebastian lies in his bed, staring at the security camera
The camera stares back at him
As if from a dream, we hear the Brunette's muffled scream and cries for help
As we push in on Sebastian's cold eyes, we can barely make out her face thrashing back in forth in panic and confusion
Sebastian suddenly rises
He crosses to the video camera and examines a small panel on the underneath of the camera
He reaches into a box of twinkies and pulls out one of the sponge cakes and begins munching
He hits the intercom button on the phone
(
0
) Yeah
'm going to the lab
(
0
) Don't you sleep
Waste of time
Da Vinci never slept
- Frank eyes Sebastian in the monitor
Okay
'm here if you need me
He watches as Sebastian's heat signature moves toward the door
- In the dark deserted lab, Sebastian pulls together a circuit board, a computer chip and some wiring
He seems be assembling something
- Sebastian crosses underneath the camera
just out of its range
reaches up and using a screwdriver, unscrews the access panel
He scans the electronics and attaches two alligator clips to wires on the circuit board
Trailing a long length of wire, Sebastian crosses back to his bed and lies down
He holds a black project box with a button on it
He lies perfectly still and press the button
- The video image of the Recovery Chamber flickers slightly, before returning to normal
- Sebastian rises and begins to peel off his latex
- Sebastian's  - Various animals stir restlessly
, visible, leaps against the Plexiglas, barking wildly
We push further down the corridor
- Again, Sebastian's  as he pushes through the open door of the observation room
We see Frank sorting through various computer readouts, highlighting certain coding sequences
We push in until we are looking over Frank's shoulder at the video monitor
According to the video, Sebastian is sleeping soundly in his room
- The rewired security camera stares down at the empty bed
- Frank glances over at the video monitor
He can see Sebastian's heat signature lying in the bed
Frank feels something on his neck
He flicks whatever it is away with his hand and goes back to work
- The elevator door opens
The Guard turns around
The elevator is empty
,
- Metro Subway train draws to a halt
With a cautionary " " its doors slide open
handful of people exit and enter
One man bumps shoulders
He turns round to apologize, but there's no one there
The doors close and the train pulls out of the station
- couple of pretty girls exit a bar and stumble to their apartments
- One of the girls enters her apartment
The door half closes behind her and then reopens and closes again
- Frank's reading a book when Linda and Matt enter
How'd it go
Quiet
He worked in the lab till about 10:30 and then went to sleep
- Close on the security camera
The wires have been removed and the access panel replaced
Sebastian whistles a cheerful tune as he finishes applying his makeup
The door opens and Linda and Matt enter
Ah, my two favorite people
Good morning
Good morning
Why so cheery this morning
You know some days you just wake up feeling the world is full of potential
Like your eyes have been opened
'm happy if  make it to my coffee machine
Linda hands Sebastian a disk
restructured the third genome on your radiated protein strand
Thought you might want to take look
Cook up a batch and let's see where we go
thought you'd want to take a look at it
trust you
Now if you'll excuse me, need to have my head examined
- Linda pulls bags of frozen plasma from the shelves in the walk-in storage freezer
'm telling you,  know him
Something's going on
Think he knows about us
If he knew about us, he'd be angry and that wasn't angry
- Janice heads up one of the corridors when something on the floor catches her eye
She bends down and takes a look at it
Barely visible on the floor is a fragment of a
She runs her finger along the dried mud
It turns to dust
- Sebastian holds his latex head on his lap, while leads hang suspended in mid-air, outlining his real head
Carter analyzes the results
' When you were a kid, you ever dream about being invisible
Sure
all the time
' What did you imagine you'd do
The usual
' What's the usual
Hanging out in the girl's locker room
Kicking Jimmy Margiani's ass
' Jimmy Margiani
School asshole
Drove a red Trans Am
Back then,  was the size of a small planet and made a rather large target
' Ever think up anything along the grand scale
Sure
World domination
Manipulating stock markets, consolidating a political power base
But those are more recent fantasies
Carter pulls off the electrodes and Sebastian slides on his latex facemask
And what if it weren't fantasy
What if you were out there in the world and could do whatever you wanted with no consequences whatsoever
How far would go
mean
if it were real
don't know, man
Out in the real world
mean, there's a responsibility
Let's say you saw a woman with amazing tits
Would you brush against them
Hell,  try and do that now
Human nature
So if you could get away with more, would you do more
read that in a survey at a major university they asked college students "Would you steal if you were guaranteed to get away with it
" 82% said yes
Eighty two percent
Makes you wonder if the world's ready for what we're doing
So, Doc what did you do
What do you mean
When you were out
just walked around
'know
Aw, you just walked around
Come on
There's more, right
Like what
Man, 'd be walking up to people saying shit like "This is God, go,get a haircut
" Or hanging out in the changing room at Victoria's Secret
Kind of sophomoric, don't you think
Besides, it was late and  wasn't out that long
Well, did you see anybody
There was this one girl
Yeah
And did you mess with her
Naw
Sebastian gives Carter a sly grin
(cont'd) Well maybe a little
(beat) tell you though, a man could get used to it
- Alone, Linda packs up her stuff for the evening
Slowly we push in on her and hear quiet breathing
We realize we are in
' Then
' Goodnight
Linda-jumps
'  (cont'd) Sorry, didn't mean to frighten you
It's fine
just didn't know you were there
Goodnight
As she leaves the Lab, he follows her down the hallway
'   - Linda passes through the revolving doors of her apartment building
few beats later, as if caught by a gust of wind, the revolving door slowly turns on its own
'  - Linda slips into her apartment and the door closes behind her
moment later we see the doorknob turn back and forth
It's locked
- On a fire escape, we see the ladder shake and descend to the ground
The metal rattles back and forth as if something were climbing it
We slowly crane up the fire escape and hold on a window
Through the wispy curtains and dirty glass we can see Linda enter the room
The panel of glass fogs from Sebastian's breath
The fog wipes away, seemingly by itself
But then through the window we see Matt walk into the living room and put his arms around Linda's waist
We hear a shocked intake of air
He kisses her neck and then slowly unzips her dress
Her dress falls to the floor
Matt takes off his sport coat and drapes it over a chair, while Linda unfastens the buttons of his shirt
They're laughing now, exchanging kisses
Matt reaches behind Linda and unhooks her bra
He kisses his way down her neck to her breasts
Linda pulls him to her
Suddenly the window shatters
Startled, both Matt and Linda jump back covering themselves
We hear Sebastian's footsteps as he retreats down the fire escape
moment later Matt reaches the window and peers out
He sees the fire escape ladder slowly rise back up down below
What was it
don't know
don't see anything
Matt picks up a piece of glass and examines it
(cont'd) It's like something hit it
Linda picks up the phone and dials
- Carter picks up the phone
Hello
Carter looks at the security monitor of the recovery room
Sebastian's heat signature lies still on the bed
(cont'd) No
No
He's here No, 'm staring at him
He's right there in his room
'  - Linda breathes a sigh of relief
Thanks
No, just checking
'Kay, bye
(hangs up phone) Phew
Matt pulls her into him
Relax
it's nothing
Where were we
- can be heard in the background
That horrible repetitive barking that grates the soul like Chinese water torture
' Be quiet
photograph of Linda drifts through the air and settles atop a flaming candle
It ignites into fire, twisting and turning in mid-air, then falling on the floor as ash beat later water runs from the sink faucet
It forms in the shape of hands and splashes against his face, dripping away
'  (cont'd) And the cyclops screamed out, "Who is it who blinds me
" and Odysseus replied "Nobody is my name"
And the Cyclops raged to his friends "Nobody is killing me
Nobody"
The barking continues
moment later the chamber door slides open
We push down the
until we are face-to-face with the unhappy barking dog
' Shhhh
It's Nobody-It's nothing
The Plexiglas door to the doggie's cage swings open and some invisible force grabs little doggie around the neck
The force squeezes its little fur ball throat until the barking stops
'  (cont'd) Nobody's gonna hurt you
The force keeps squeezing until the little doggie goes limp
Then the dog smashes against the Plexiglas over and over until blood spills out its mouth
The Plexiglas door swings closed again and moments later the door to Sebastian's cubicle closes as well
The water runs in Sebastian's sink washing the blood away from his now half visible hands
: '  - Sarah sees the dead dog lying prone on its bedding
She eyes it curiously and opens the cage door
- Sarah stares at the empty chamber
You awake
' am now
The sheets raise and drape off of him
Notice anything unusual last night
' No
Why
Franklin Three
He's dead
Sebastian pulls a sheet around him
He moves across the dimly lit room like a ghost
What of
His neck was broken and his windpipe collapsed
' How'd that happen
thought maybe you could tell me
' Sarah
You saying  had something to do with it
He was alive last night when  left and he was dead this morning
And you were the only one down here
' was in my room all night
- Sarah sits with Carter as they run through the security video tape
Matt and Linda look over their shoulder
That's all twelve hours
He never left the room
windpipe doesn't just suddenly collapse
Someone or something killed it
You saw the tape
The man was in his chamber
Then we have a problem, because  the cage was locked from the outside
That means it was opened, the dog was killed and the cage was closed and locked again
Only a human could do that
Well, it wasn't me
And it wasn't him
Are we sure
- Linda passes Sebastian's chamber
Sebastian's in latex
Any big plans for tonight
Quiet night at home
Maybe a book
Really
Whatever happened to that guy your were seeing
He's still in the picture
Why
Being locked down here, 'm forced to live vicariously
Someday you'll have to tell me what he's like
Maybe someday  will
See you in the morning
Au domain
Sebastian watches Linda walk away
He glances at the camera and starts to peel off his face
- The elevator door opens
It's empty
'  - as we push past the guard and down onto the street
- Empty street
We hear whistling
Splashes of water splat out from shallow puddles,,as Sebastian walks through them
'  -  car approaches
As it drives by we see Matt and Linda inside, heading back to the warehouse
The footsteps stop
' Hmmm
We see the footsteps start to head back toward the warehouse
- Linda and Matt exit their car and cross toward the elevator
(to Marine Guard) Forgot something
- As we watch the footsteps head back through the puddles toward the warehouse, we see Frank pass us in his car
' What the hell
He breaks into a run
Feet splash water and he races back toward the warehouse
- Empty
The elevator door opens and we push out into the hallway
Sebastian's - We follow Sebastian down the hallway to his cubicle
But as he rounds the corner, he quickly ducks back
The entire research team is in his cubicle
Sebastian slowly approaches and watches as Frank takes down his video board
Pretty clever really
All it does is recycle the signal
He flips this switch, it takes a snapshot and that's all we see
Asshole
And you think he's violent
He killed a dog with his bare hands
Dogs aren't people
Are we in any danger
Linda doesn't know
Either way, we aren't equipped to handle this
We have to inform the committee
Everybody murmurs in agreement
What if he doesn't come back
They'll go after him
(beat) Who has tonight's shift
do
Pretend nothing's wrong
Everyone just do what you're doing so he doesn't become suspicious
Okay
Matt and 'll go tell Doctor Kramer and we'll lot the committee deal with it
Sebastian's  - He backs away and races down the hall
'  -   - The stately stone house sits on a finely manicured lawn in one of the nicest neighborhoods in town
Linda's car is parked on the curb in front
We break from a typical establishing shot and as the tracks closer to the house, we realize that we are ' We hear breathing and footsteps as we push through some bushes and head toward a bay window which looks into the Kramer living room
Through the glass we see  and  seated across from
We can't hear what they're saying but it certainly looks serious
Kramer puffs on a pipe and strokes his beard, shaking his head
Kramer rises and shakes hands with Linda and Matt, and the three of them head toward the front door
We move away from the window and track toward the front door
As the door opens we begin to hear the tail end of the conversation
'll call General Caster right now and convene the oversight committee tomorrow
Thank you, sir
What do we do in the meantime
Just sit tight and wait for my call
Matt and Linda head down to her car
Kramer heads back inside
'  - Kramer heads back into the living room
His wife appears a the upstairs railing
What was that about
Just a little trouble at work
You coming up
In a minute
have to make a few calls
Mrs
Kramer retreats back to her bedroom as Dr
Kramer crosses over to the telephone
He picks up the receiver and starts dialing
In the middle of dialing, the phone goes dead
He clicks the hookswitch up and down trying to get a dial tone
Nothing
He checks the connections on the phone and then follows the wiring to the wall
The line's plugged in
Weird
He hears a door creak open in the kitchen
(cont'd) Hello
Hello
Kramer crosses to the darkened kitchen
The kitchen door leading to the backyard is open
Puzzled, he crosses to it
wind stirs across the pool and backyard, swirling dead leaves in small twists of wind
The windchime rings lightly
Kramer steps out
/,  - In the dim spillover light from house, Kramer crosses to the telephone- box against the back of the house
It Is open and several of the wires have been pulled
He looks around, spooked and puffs out a cloud of smoke from his pipe
For the briefest of instants, Sebastian's face is visible in the smoke
Kramer jumps back in surprise and the pipe drops from his mouth
He gives a small sharp cry, but deep indentations appear across his mouth and his cries are stifled
In the darkness, we can make out his form writhing as if possessed
The struggle continues a beat until Kramer manages to break free
Help
As Kramer runs, he looks behind him
But no one's there
Something slams into Kramer and he tumbles, rolling into the pool
But as he hits water there's not just one splash, but
In the water next to him is human shaped -
It's Sebastian displacing the water
And because of the water displacement, we can clearly see two arms pushing Kramer beneath the water's surface
opens the bedroom window and looks down at the pool
All she can see is her husband drowning
his flailing limbs kicking up a massive air bubble around him
She races from the window
Kramer kicks and flails for a few moments and then his limbs stop moving moment later he floats to surface, face down
The bobs over to the pool ladder, and rising from the pool, we see Sebastian's body outlined in sheets of water
The shape melts away in a cascading waterfall until all we can see of Sebastian are the hundreds of tiny droplets still clinging to his body, caught in the light like twinkling bulbs on a Christmas tree
The shape disappears into the darkness
moment later Martha emerges from the house and sees her husband floating face down in the pool
She screams
- Linda passes by Sebastian's chamber
' What
No good morning for me
Don't you like me anymore
Oh, sorry
'm in a hurry
' That's okay
It's going to be busy day
'  - Matt sits across from her, twirling a pen in his hand
They both stare at the phone
When did he say held call
He's probably meeting with the committee trying to figure out what to do
'm gonna call him
Linda picks up the phone and dials
(cont'd) Yes, Dr
Kramer please
Excuse me
(inhales sharply - surprised) When
'm so sorry
Linda blanches as she hangs up the phone
What
He's dead
Drowned in his pool last night
Linda picks up the phone again and dials
(cont'd) Yes, General Thompson please
Thank you
As she waits the phone line clicks dead
(cont'd) Hello
Hello
She clicks on the hookswitch
Let me see that
He tries it too
Same result
(cont'd) Intercom's working, but there doesn't seem to be an outside line
/ They waste no time getting to the elevator
Linda and Matt step in

Tell me this isn't happening
- Frank, Sarah, Carter and Janice man various work stations in the lab
Linda and Matt enter
We've got a problem
- Frank's fingers fly over the keyboard
How long before anybody starts looking for us
There's no set check in procedure
It could be weeks
graphic of the elevator system pops up on the screen
Frank highlights the security terminal
Frank hits a few more keys
The screen reduces to a series of numbers
(cont'd) You think you can got in
Frank rewrites a few of the numbers
Already in
It was only a second level encryption
The Security System specifications pops up
Some security system
Oh the system is fine
It's just 'm just extraordinary
Frank types a few more keys, and his eyes widen
(cont'd) But apparently someone is more extraordinary than me
What is it
There's nothing wrong with the system
Our codes have been removed
Removed
By who
Here's a clue
Only one code remains
Whose
Dr
Sebastian Caine
The team approaches Sebastian's chamber
Carter pulls on the pair of thermal goggles dangling from his neck up
- The chamber is empty
He's not in there
Linda enters the chamber
She notes that Sebastian's face and makeup are on the sink vanity
Linda crosses to the phone and hits the " " Okay, Sebastian
Fun's over
Tell us where you are
She waits
Then
' 'm sorry
But  can't lot you turn me in
Sebastian
where are you
'  () You have no idea what it's like
The power of it
The freedom
can't let that go
'mon Sebastian
You're scaring me
Tell me where you are and we can talk about it
'  () There's nothing to talk about
See
've done things that can't be undone
long beep as the intercom clicks off
Sebastian
Sebastian
(beat) want search parties
Thermal goggles and tranquilizers
Linda and Matt, wearing thermal goggles and clutching tranquilizer pistols, walk down the hallway, scanning back and forth
' Janice enters the office
Dr
Caine
Are you in here
Dr
Caine
Suddenly, Janice jerks back
' 'm here
' Sarah scans all the habitats with a thermal scanner
Listening intently
' Janice struggles with her unseen assailant, slamming into walls and knocking into filing cabinets
Frank and Carter search the lab with their thermal scopes
Doctor Caine
' Linda and Matt knock
Sebastian
No response
They push through the door
The room seems deserted
Signs of a struggle
File cabinets opened, drawers tossed
This is bad
- Linda surveys the room, spotting a slight heat signature peeking from the corner
There's something over there
Linda moves toward it
Whatever it is its hidden from Matt's  by the supply cabinet
As Linda gets close she pulls of f her thermal goggles to see
- Her face blue, eyes bulging
An
cord wrapped around his neck
Linda jumps back
(cont'd) Jesus
Oh my god
Matt rushes over
Sees the lifeless corpse
What happened
Linda lowers the body to the floor
She was strangled
Multiple blows to her head
Linda begins a medical check of the rest of the body
Matt stoops down and examines Janice's face
(cont'd) We got a big problem here
lamp tumbles from the desk and smashes to the floor
Both Linda and Matt jump
Linda frantically dons the thermal visor and scopes the room again
Nothing
Matt notices the lamp cord beneath Linda's leg
Points it out to her
She sighs with relief
she pulled the lamp off the table
(cont'd) Get everybody to the conference room
Now
Matt picks up the phone
Clicks the hookswitch
Clicks the hookswitch again
Intercom
the phone lines
They're dead
Gimme that
She checks the phone, punches some numbers
Nothing
(cont'd) It was just working
What the fuck is going on here
Matt and Linda head toward the lab
Linda suddenly stops
What
Shhh
Linda takes a few cautious steps
Senses something
(cont'd) Give me the visor
Matt, suddenly concerned, hands her the visor
- Linda checks out the corridor
Empty
Linda takes Matt's hand
(cont'd) 'mon
They move quickly up the corridor
See Frank, Sarah and Carter
Did you find him
Janice is dead
Linda scans the room with her thermal scope
It's clear
Matt, Frank, Janice and Sarah step in, locking the door behind them
The man has checked out of reality
What happened
don't understand
Isn't it obvious
Right now, we're the only ones who knows he exists
If he gets rid of us, no one knows and he becomes the most powerful man on earth
But he's not a killer
They all look at Linda
He wasn't
He is now
Can you fix the elevator
Restore our codes
It'd take hours to crack the encryptions
Right now that sounds like good news
So what do we do until then
Sit around waiting for him to kill us off
Everyone looks around for some leadership
Finally
No
We find him, before he finds us
- The group moves quickly, passing under an air vent
As they round the corner the vent slowly swings down and an air disturbance drops to the ground
As they enter
You sure this'll work
Linda sits down at a computer terminal, activates it
We designed it to help find the rats we kept dropping in year one
They were too small for thermal scans
map of the compound appears on the screen
Systems hot
Activating motion detectors
Matt toggles a switch
Linda stares at a map of the compound
Blips appear on the display
in the observation room
in the Habitat Area and in one of the corridors
've got movement in Corridor Six
That's him
- shadow edges down the tunnel
It settles for a moment, disappearing completely, then is back on the move
At the tunnel's edges, motion detectors light up as the thing passes by
Carter checks his Tranq pistol & Matt rummages through a locker
Got 'em
Matt pulls out a pair of walkie-talkies
He tosses one to Linda
(into walkie) Check
Check
Her voice echoes from the other unit
(cont'd) Be careful
Just watch our backs
Hey Carter, ready
Let's do it
Matt and Carter exit
Linda locks the door behind them
Matt and Carter trot toward corridor six
- Linda huddles over the display, tracking the two
(into Walkie) Take a right at the next accessway
He's working his way back to the offices
We see Matt and Carter on one of the working video screens as they push down the tunnel
- Matt and Carter move cautiously, listening for any sound
(Walkie - sotto) If we split up, can we trap him on corridor eight
(
0
) If he keeps heading in that direction
Matt nods to Carter
The pair splits, heading down separate accessways
Going Thermal
Matt pulls the visor down over his eyes
- Linda watches the two separate and come around Sebastian in a pincer move
Suddenly, the blip that was Sebastian disappears
Linda grabs the walkie
lost him
Matt,  lost him
- Matt makes his way forward
He probably just stopped moving
But Matt becomes more cautious with his footsteps
Slowly approaching a corner
He rounds the corner and sees a heat signature at the far end of the corridor
He levels his pistol, ready to fire
It's me
Matt pulls off his goggles
Do you have anything
Nothing
How did he get by us
He couldn't
Sebastian
We're here to help
Sebastian
No response
They both don their visors and move forward slightly
Carter holds up his hand
There
Behind those pipes
He's not moving
Carter points
Matt checks his thermal
red heat signature clings to the wall
(cont'd) Doctor Caine
(beat) Can you hear me
No response
(into walkie) We see him
But he's not responding
The heat signature doesn't move
Matt looks through his visor and holds the tranquilizer gun at the ready
He looks for a clear shot
The heat signature huddles behind pipes
'mon
'mon
The two slowly move closer
Matt finally has a clear shot
He signals Carter
Carter levels his pistol too
Covered
Matt fires the dart at the heat signature
It bounces off the wall
Nothing there
What the
He crosses to the heat signature
(cont'd) Just a vent
Just a goddamn vent (
0
) He was there
Looks like
looks like we're pumping out heat
Suddenly behind him
in the air, kicking wildly
-
He gasps for air
(
0
) got movement again
He's right on top of you
No fucking shit
Matt opens fire with the tranquilize, shooting at the ceiling until he spends his dart rounds
(cont'd) Sebastian
Goddamnit
Let him go
(choking) Help
MMmmphg Carter suffocates
He passes out
With a sudden crack, he's thrown against the side wall
large cut opens up across his head and his body goes limp
(into walkie) Where is he
Where the fuck is he
- Linda huddles over the display
Right on top of you
- Matt scrambles away
Running
Pipes burst and swing down from the ceiling
Steam billows forth
Something moves through the cloud of steam
Around the corner, Matt shoves more darts into his tranquilizer
(
0
) What's going on
Are you okay
Carter's down
Hurt bad
Bleeding from a head wound
- Linda watches the screen
Two blips, one traveling quickly
Matt, he's coming toward you
- Matt takes a few steps back
Shit
Got outta there
Matt breaks into a run
Linda watches one dot chasing the other, down several corridors
He's close
Matt running, checking over his shoulder
Sounds of footsteps behind him, but up ahead the heavy metal blast doors begin to close
Goddamnit
The doors are closing
He's shutting me in
Matt rushes the doors as they slide shut
He doesn't make it in time
The doors close with a resounding clang
Matt turns and pulls on his thermals
(cont'd) Where is he
- Linda huddled over the screen
Tense
He's coming right at you
Then checks the Thermal goggles
Several heat signature dot the tunnel
Where
Twenty, maybe thirty feet
Goddamnit,  got thermals all over the place
Eight, maybe ten of them
Must be ghosts
- Linda gets a sense of forboding
She looks around the room
Sees a heating vent in the corner
Beat
She grabs the walkie
Those signatures
they're coming from the heating vents
Through the goggles, Matt sees the tunnel turning red
'm starting to lose resolution on my thermals
Get out of there
If the room temperature is the same as his body temperature, thermal visors'll be no good
Linda grabs a Tranq gun and heads for the door
'm going
Linda
it's not safe
That's why 'm going
(to Frank and Sarah) Corridor eight is clear
Get Carter to the lab
We'll meet you there
But
Do it
Matt turns to face the corridor
It's turning red
Matt sees some movement in the thermal cloud
Opens fire
But the thermal signature disappears into the heat
Matt can't distinguish anything through his goggles anymore
He pulls them off and holds him gun in front of him sweeping the hallway
' Marco
Polo
Marco
Polo
His voice keeps shifting
Matt fires
'  (cont'd) Not even close
Matt sweeps his front leg back and forth, like a blind man using a cane
But his foot isn't hitting anything
He sees a   mounted on the wall
He rushes it, turns it on the hallway and sprays
And through the foam
, sending him tumbling down the tunnel
Matt is thrown against the wall
Blood coming from his brow
He scrambles away, spraying more foam
Sees a shape in the mist, raises his pistol and The shape leaps away
The
Doesn't hit
Matt scrambles back into a corner
His pistol is empty
So
just out of curiosity, how long has my best friend been fucking my ex- girlfriend
Sebastian
Get a hold of yourself
You aren't thinking rationally
' She's a pretty sweet fuck, isn't she
Calm down, Sebastian
we can talk this through
It's not too late
The Shape parts the low hanging mist, the fine powder swirling in clouds behind it
Coming toward him
(') 'mon Sebastian
Don't do this
'm your friend
' 'm sorry, but  just feel that our friendship is holding me back
'm sure you understand
Linda reaches through, grabs Matt
She pulls him to his feet and through the door
Frank and Sarah, holding their Tranq pistols, fly down the corridor
This way
They shear off the main corridor into the side corridor
Carter lies crumpled up ahead
Sarah slides to his side
Carter's head rests in a pool of blood
She checks his pulse while Frank takes a protective position
(cont'd) Pulse is weak
Breathing
shallow
He'll be okay
It's pretty severe
We have to get him to the lab
He's got to be okay
Frank stands frozen
For godsakes, help me
Frank snaps to
Grabs an arm
The pair hoist Carter up and carry him down the hallway
Linda pulls a handle and doors slide shut behind them
He was going to kill me
Linda pulls him close
know
He's gone
We've got to got out of here
Linda checks the screen -- see Sarah, Frank and Carter headed toward the Laboratory
(cont'd) Where is he
Goddamnit, where is he
Isolated in the Hallway of Habitats is a single blip
Habitats
Oh god
That's right between us and the lab
Frank and Sarah lift Carter onto a medical table
His pulse is faint
Sarah grabs a sheet from the counter top
Folds it and presses it against the head wound
(cont'd) He's lost a lot of blood
Here
Hold this
She guides Frank's hands to the wound
(cont'd) Keep applying pressure
Sarah pulls out a saline solution
bag and slap it on the rack
She fumbles with the needle as she tries to find a vein
(cont'd) Don't move your hand until  got back
Sarah heads to the door
Where are you going
This'll hold him but he needs blood
But
Supply is right down the hall
'll be two seconds
Sarah, wait for the others If  wait, he'll die
Keep pressure on the wound
Sarah exits the lab
Checks the corridor
Down at the end of the cramped tunnel is the supply room
She swallows her fear and heads toward it, all the while glancing side-to-side and behind her
Spooked, Sarah bursts into the room
She goes to the supply fridge/freezer, pulls open the door, and sorts through blood bags
Matt and Linda push along the corridor; Matt spraying with the fire extinguisher in short controlled bursts, Linda clutching her tranquilizer like a commando
noise behind them
Footsteps
Matt turns to blast with the extinguisher
The white chemical dust sprays out, outlining a shape in the tunnel
But it isn't a human shape
Matt's uniform shreds
Something with fierce sharp claws fells him
Tearing into his flesh
We see a angry, hungry face
jabbing for a moment through the lingering fog
Ahh
Shit
Linda tries to get a clear shot off through the smoke
Matt trips and goes sprawling
Something yelps
howl
Linda shoots
Her dart jabs into something which collapses to the ground
moment of calm
As the dusty chemical foam settles, the outline of a great ape appears, still twitching
(cont'd) Karl Three
Nice shot
He's let the animals out
It wasn't him we were tracking
Linda leans against the wall, still clutching her tranq gun at the ready
The heat is getting to bar
Bar scrubs are soaked, her hair's a mess
She wipes the sweat from her brow
(cont'd) You okay
It won't kill me unless it gets infected
You
Me
Don't ask about me
If he freed all the animals, we could have dozens running around the lab
So he could be anywhere right now
Matt sprays the whole tunnel, putting down a gentle cloud mist
Nothing else appears
(cont'd) What do we do
Get to the lab, lock the goddamn doors and pray to God Frank can reprogram the elevator
Sarah finishes collecting blood bags and shuts the door to the fridge/freezer
The   behind her
She freezes and slowly turns
Frank
She eyes the supply room, looking for a sign of movement
(cont'd) (frightened whisper) Who's there
She listens
Is that breathing she hears
Now she's starting to panic
(cont'd) Dr
Caine
She starts to back away, but she's already in the corner
She clutches her tranquilizer gun, but there's nothing to aim at
The vials of blood on the shelf gives her an idea
She reaches over, grabs a vial and throws it on the floor
and   across the linoleum
Sarah tosses another vial and another
Becoming more and more hysterical
Splattering more and more blood
But she runs out of vials
Shaking with fear, she searches the blood looking for a footprint, or movement
But there's nothing there
Sarah waits a beat, clutching the tranquilizer gun
Takes a step
Waits a beat longer
Finally she relaxes
It was just her imagination
She heads toward the door when she hears a terrifying whisper in her ear
' You missed
Her hair flies up, and she swings against the wall
She tries to move, but she's pinned there
Her hands struggling against the force
Please no
Let me go
Oh god, let me go
The arm holding the tranquilizer gun begins to move
(cont'd) What are you doing
No
Sarah fights, but her arm moves nonetheless (cont'd) Help me
Oh God
Somebody help me
Slowly, deliberately, her own arm moves down the wall and around, until the tranquilizer gun points right at her stomach
Sarah watches in horror as her own body betrays her
(cont'd) No
please
Don't do this to me
She struggles, shaking back and forth
Writhing
In anguish and in fear
(cont'd) What do you want
You
The trigger pulls
Pop
dart explodes from the gun and imbeds in Sarah's stomach
She whimpers as her eyes glass over
Suddenly she's released
She stumbles backward and falls lifeless to the floor
moment of stillness, all we can hear is the sound of someone breathing
On Sarah's face
a slight-indentation runs down her cheek
Almost sweet
almost tender
And slight indentation runs across her breast and strokes down her body
The sense of violation and vulnerability is awful
Sebastian sighs
' 've always liked your feistiness
Sarah's head shifts slightly
Her head shifts violently, accompanied by the celery crunch of her neck snapping
Sebastian exhales, his breath filled with the intoxication of power
- Frank applies pressure to the wound, waiting for Sarah to return
Carter's vital signs are weakening
,
Sarah
Sarah
(to Carter) Goddamnit
Stay with me now
Don't you let up
Sarah
Sarah
No response
Frank doesn't know whether to stay or go after her
He starts toward the door several times but can't leave Carter
Finally the door opens
(cont'd) Sarah
'm losing him
But it's Linda and Matt
(cont'd) Did you see her
Linda rushes over to check on Carter
Where is she
She went to the supply room
Carter needed blood
Linda grabs a stethoscope and listens to Carter's heart
said no one goes anywhere alone
She didn't listen
She-slowly pulls Frank's hand away from the wound
(cont'd) But
He's dead
Linda would love to cry about it, but doesn't afford herself the luxury
The three of them approach the supply room door slowly
Blood trickles from under the door and bloody footprints extend down the hallway
They swing open the door
The floor is covered in blood and broken glass
But no body
Sarah, broken, is dragged toward the chair, eerily jerking down the hallway
seemingly on its own
The three scientists follow the bloody footprints down the hallway past the empty cages in the tunnel of habitats
All clutch their tranquilizer pistols
The footprints lead past the habitats to Sebastian's chamber
They see Sarah's body in the dim light
Oh god
Sarah
The group breaks into a run
Linda pushes into the chamber and falls at Sarah's side
Matt cradles Sarah's head
They look for some sign of life as Linda fights back the tears
(cont'd) No
Her too
Matt nods
Linda slams the cubicle wall with her fist
This didn't happen
This hasn't happened
It happened alright
Now we have to deal with it
Matt puts his hands on her shoulder to calm her
She pushes him off
Yeah
And just what are we supposed to do now
' Now
Now you die
The three of them whip around
He's here
Where
Sebastian
Silence
The three cautiously move out
They stand back to back, each one facing out
They move toward the door of the Chamber
(cont'd) Sebastian
Sebastian, listen to me
No response
They all their tranq pistols level waiting for some sign
Hearing each other breathe
They slowly move outside the Chamber into the corridor
(CONT1D) don't know if you can understand this, but what you're experiencing is a psychological breakdown
This isn't who you are
beat
' would say that what  am experiencing is psychological awareness
like you being in complete and absolute control
They identify the general area the voice is coming from: Back inside the Chamber
They slowly move toward the Chamber door
With lightning speed they slam the door shut, locking Sebastian inside the Recovery Chamber
You goddamn bastard
You goddamn bastard
You're gonna pay for this
'm going to bring you back to visibility and then 'm going throw your ass in jail
' You're never gonna bring me back Linda
never want to come back
Fuck you
' Or maybe 'll fuck you
One last time for old times sake
Linda slams her fist against the wall of the Chamber
Don't listen to him
It's not worth it
Come on, Matt
Let's go get the elevator back on-line so we can got out of this hell hole
Matt gives Linda a kiss
He does anything, anything at all, come get us
'll be back to check on you in five
Matt and Frank head off down the corridor
' Imagine you two, carrying on right under my nose
Out of curiosity, what did he give you that  couldn't
Shut up, Sebastian
He's more of a man than you'll ever be
- shows Linda pacing outside the Chamber door
The chair moves forward toward a microphone
' Okay, sweetie
'll be quiet
If that's what you want
Sebastian  the intercom switch
We pan over to one of the working video screens
Matt and Frank stride down the hallway
The chair swivels and the observation room door swings open slightly
Linda still holds his tranq gun toward the door
Nothing moves
Nothing
Linda walks over to the Plexiglas
stares in
Can't see anything, anyone
Just the dead Sarah
Then she sees it
The little red light on the intercom
Its on
Sebastian
Sebastian
No
No
Linda bangs on the glass
She looks
No movement, no nothing
She listens
Shit
She takes off running
(cont'd) Matt
Frank
Tracking with Linda as she rushes down the hall
(cont'd) Matt
Matt
Frank
- Linda breaks in the room to see Frank slicked in blood, his throat cut, and Matt bleeding from multiple stab wounds with an extension cord around his neck being pulled tight
Jesus
Linda rushes over and slams into Matt
They fall to the ground
Linda crawls over to Matt, but her head snaps back and her lips erupt with blood
' Figured it out
You were always so clever
Matt's pulled back across the lab by the cord around his neck
He grabs at the cord trying to breathe
Linda watches him being pulled away
No
She clamors over to him
But Matt rises in the air and is tossed against the lab table
Linda levels her dart pistol and fires haphazardly at the air
She hits nothing but objects jerk and move in a line as Sebastian heads for cover
Linda manages to grab Matt and pull him to her
(cont'd) Hang on
Get out of here
Linda pulls Matt toward the door
(yelling) You won't get away with this
They'll find out about you
They'll hunt you down
' The villagers with their torches
Lock up your daughters
Sorry, Lin
It's not gonna happen that way
Linda hits the lights
The lab is now very, very dark
'  (cont'd) See, 've spent all my time down here thinking up this plan
When they find you, they'll find a pile of charred corpses
The result of a terrible accident, 'm afraid
Linda reacts to the voice as it grows nearer
She navigates the maze of equipment, heading toward the crack of light at the front door
How can you be so brutal
' guess because  don't have to look at myself in the mirror anymore (beat) Remember that first night  was out did something bad, just to see if could get away with it
And when did,  realized  could have it all can kill in broad daylight
And nobody's gonna tell the police they were fucked by a ghost
Anything desire  can make happen, but not if people know
Linda and Matt have reached the door of the lab
She pushes through it and slams it behind her
- Linda pulls Matt along
'm dizzy
can't feel my legs
Just keep going
'll fix you later
,   - The doors explode open
- Linda looks up and down the hall and pulls Matt inside the supply room
It's still blood soaked from earlier
Linda closes the door, sliding the deadbolt into place
Linda lots him drop like a heap onto the floor
She falls to her knees beside Matt, lying on the ground
Matt
Matthew
Stay with me now
Linda pulls his scrubs open
The wounds are many and deep
He surprised us
We weren't expecting
Shhh
Don't talk
Something slams against the door
Bam
Slams against it again
The old deadbolt is buckling
Linda looks around the room and sees the storage freezer
(cont'd) We gotta move
Hang on
Linda helps Matt up and into the storage freezer
Linda grabs a metal bar and slides it between two hooks on the door and the jam
The storage room door blows open
Linda leans down next to Matt
Lin
He entire shirt is stained with blood
He's having trouble breathing
(cont'd) can't feel anything
Linda picks up his hand
Grips it tight
You feel that
Matt smiles
little
She rips his shirt open
and sees his wounds
She grabs a vial of alcohol and dumps it on her hands and then probes the wound
Your losing blood, but he didn't hit the vitals
She looks around
(cont'd) Sutures and thread
She rises, and looks outside the porthole into the room
Suddenly it fogs up and she almost sees a face
She stumbles backward, and the door starts rattling
Linda scrambles over to hold the metal crowbar in place
Sebastian pulls and rattles on the freezer door
To no avail
It's not gonna budge
Finally he gives up
The door stops shaking
Linda is relieved, briefly
Still
Then she hears the click of the door locking
as the dial turns from forty-five degrees, down to negative twenty
Through the porthole, Linda sees the bloody footprints heading toward the door
She removes the metal bar and pushes on the door
It won't move
Goddamnit
Linda looks around the storage room
She grabs a roll of duct tape and pulls off a length
What're you doing
This is temporary
She takes paper towel and cleans off Matt's wound
She tapes it, using duct tape
(cont'd) You still with me
Barely
beat later, the compressor begins pumping Arctic air into the freezer
Just keeps getting worse
Linda returns to the door
Shakes it
- We hear  as we see a sheet of flesh fill out into a head as Sebastian slides on his latex head piece
Linda continues shaking the door
The lock holds
tear rolls down Linda's cheek, but a strange thing happens
The tear drops freeze
Linda shivers as she pulls the icy tears from her face
Oh shit
The inside thermometer has dropped to five degrees
Linda grabs the metal bar and starts smashing it against the porthole
The metal bar just bounces off the glass
' drawer opens, revealing a set of clothing neatly folded
Shirt, pants, shoes
They begin to move
Linda drops the metal bar and slides down the wall, defeated
There's no way out
There's got to be
They say freezing to death isn't so bad
You just kinda pass out
Matt's head rolls back
Matt
She checks his pulse
Thank god he still has one, but he's not gonna last long
They're both already starting to turn a little blue
Linda stares desperately up at the shelves, trying to find some sort of advantage
Then she sees something
She looks back at the door lock and then she rises
and grabs    coiled on the shelf
(cont'd) We're not dying in here
- Sebastian, dressed in street clothes, stands before the mirror applying make-up to his latex mask
Linda finishes stripping the insulation off the electric cord
She grabs a hypodermic needle package, and her cold fingers fumbles with the package as she tries to pull out the plastic tube
She finally gets it out and she starts wrapping the stripped electric wire around the tube in a tight coil
- Sebastian slides on a wig and checks his appearance in the mirror
Pretty smooth
Even from relatively close up, he could pass as normal
Linda furiously winds wire into a coil
Sebastian heads down the corridor
Lingering steam twists in and around the hallway, long wispy tendrils
Sebastian pauses for a moment, hearing
Suddenly the hallway seems a lot scarier
From beneath his scrubs he pulls his own tranq gun
He listens
hearing scraping and footsteps
Watching the water on the floor twitch
With machine like precision, he turns and fires
The tranq dart halts in mid-air and some invisible thing tumbles over
Sebastian continues down the hallway
Linda holds the plug end of the extension cord
The other end is wrapped into a tight long coil
Linda looks for an outlet, but can't find one
She looks at the overhead lights
moment later she's climbing up the shelving
She wrap* a piece of fabric around her hand, and with a sharp punch she smashes one of the overhead light bulbs
Sebastian enters, fully dressed
At a distance it'd be hard to tell his secret
He pulls several chemicals off the shelves
Then he pulls a tray of test tubes over and begins mixing
Linda works on jerry rigging the two ends of the wire to the lightbulb, socket
Suddenly the coiled wire springs to life and flies against the nearest metal surface
She's made an electromagnet
Sebastian loads the filled test tubes into the centrifuge
Dozens of other vials are already slotted
He takes one of the left over vials, considers it a moment and then flings it over to the other side of the lab
The vial shatters and
powerful explosion that rocks the room
Linda feels the rumbling as she places the coil up against the door
The magnet attaches itself
Linda shakes the coil, trying to get the doorlock to move
- We see the lock twitching
Shaking
- Linda shivers as she plays with the coil
Her eyes glaze and she stumbles backward
Her surgical scrubs, once soaked with sweat, are now frozen stiff
She composes herself and pushes back toward the door
Her heavy breath hangs as a low cloud of Mist
- Sebastian looks over the dozens of other test tubes, calculating their combined power in his mind
Then he closes the top of the centrifuge
He taps a few commands into its timer
The door lock twitches again and twists back
The door swings opens and Linda stumbles out, mashing into a supply shelf of oxygen canisters
The canisters tumble every which way as Linda tumbles to the ground
She scrambles to her feet and goes in after Matt, pulling his cold body out of the storage locker
She pulls stacks of paper down from, the shelves into a trashcan, grabs an industrial lighter and ignites the paper
She pushes Matt close to the small bonfire
As she does, the oxygen tanks catch her eye
Sebastian exits the lab, locking the door behind him
He heads down the darkened tunnel
Something scampers in front of him
Small, not visible
Sebastian sends it reeling with a swift violent kick
,    - Sebastian, dressed and in full latex, comes striding up the tunnel
He taps a code into the elevator vault doors
The vault doors open revealing the elevator
The doors slide open and Sebastian steps inside
Authorization please
Caine
One One One One One
Authorization valid
Thank you
Sebastian
And there's Linda
Slicked with dirt and blood
She holds a oxygen container with a cut line
(cont'd) can't let you leave
Come on out and 'll give you one last chance
You said it yourself, Lin
shouldn't hold on to the past
The door starts to shut
Aaaaaaahhhh
She hits the top of a  duct-taped to the hose line of    into the elevator
Sebastian goes up in flame
Linda runs toward the elevator
Just as the door's about to close, she slides
Her foot jamming into it
She lets loose with the flame again
Sebastian, backed into the corner, has no where to go
He's yelling in pain
His latex   and burns
The surgical scrubs
With no other escape route, he dives toward the door
Linda looks up to see his flaming body fly over her, back into the corridor
Linda kills the tank as Sebastian continues to burn
The elevator lights flickers and the security panel goes up in a shower of sparks
The elevator dies
Linda pulls herself to her feet and turns to see
Half of Sebastian's head  , his latex facade a gruesome smoke-damaged mass
His clothes are half burned revealing large blistering bubbly welts underneath, like deformed blackened bubble wrap
Sebastian crawls to his feet, but Linda hits him with another shot of flame
Sebastian pulls at his clothes as he crawls around the corner
Oh God
Linda stalks toward him
You wanna see God
'll show you God
Linda turns the corner to see a heap of smoldering latex and clothing strewn about the corridor floor
Sebastian, looking like some ugly creature, pushes down the corridor
He throbs with his blackened skin blistering and cracking up and down his body
Linda lets loose another jet of flame
It's smaller than the first and doesn't quite hit Sebastian
Linda checks the tanks pressure gauge
It slowly drops
Linda follows the blackened horror into the maze of tunnels
But as he pushes along the corridor, his burns slowly re- absorb themselves
Sebastian is no longer visible
quiet moment in the hallway as Linda realizes how vulnerable she is
She looks around for him desperately
Nothing
But something on the ceiling catches her attention
She blasts it with the last jet of her dying torch , hit by fire, comes to life
Water sprays down on the tunnel
Sebastian is caught in the downpour, his invisible frame outlined by water
It comes toward her, the hot skin steaming in the water
He grabs Linda and slams her against the wall
His watery hand smashes her across her face
Linda reels
On the floor, she looks to see Sebastian stalking toward her
She crawls away, but he grabs her by her hair, pulls her to her feet and slams her against the wall
'm gonna find everyone in your family and kill them-
Your sister
she never liked me
think 'll go after her and her little boy first
Sebastian smashes her head against a metal post
Her head cuts open, blood dripping down
(cont'd) just wanted you to know that before you die
Linda collapses to the floor
Sebastian's foot presses against her neck, squeezing it
Linda gags for breath
But through the shoot of water that is Sebastian, we see something also
a watery smudge
- smashes Sebastian with the metal bar
Sebastian slams against the corridor wall and sinks down
Matt staggers
It's taken all his strength to got there
He drops the crowbar and seeks the wall for support, he sinks to his knees by Linda
Thought 'd
thought 'd save you for a change
He gives her his hand and pulls her up into his arms
(cont'd) Let's got out of here
Just as the two turn, Sebastian rises with the crowbar
He swings it with a yell
Matt pushes Linda out of the way, his arm glancing the blow into a conduit
The conduit splits open and severs  wiring
The shoots up the crowbar and into Sebastian
As the current pulses through his body, Sebastian vibrates
His blood vessels yank back to visibility, followed by his skeletal structure and major organs
Sebastian is slowly electrified
Smoke pours off him and he becomes more and more visible
Finally he collapses
His body throbbing in and out of visibility
Matt and Linda stumble away
- Just outside the lab
Linda tries to pry open the sealed doors with the crowbar
But she can't
Through the doors porthole she sees a collection of chemicals and the fire raging from the earlier explosion
Nitro
Matt peaks inside
He said it himself
All they'll find is a pile of charred corpses
She sees the centrifuge
The timed counter on its face counts down from a minute
Fifty nine
Fifty eight
Fifty seven
He's rigged the centrifuge
In an enclosed space, he'll wipe out the whole lab
Linda and Matt move as fast as they can
They reach the burned out elevator
What the hell are they gonna do
We know the damn thing doesn't work
She swings her crowbar at the ceiling
The maintenance hatch comes down
Grab on
Linda hooks the crowbar onto the hatch lip and pulls herself up
She reaches back down for Matt
Forget about me
You go
Fuck you
Give me your hands
Linda grabs Matt's hands and pulls for all she's worth
She struggles, but they both manage to got him through the hatch
- Three
two
one
The centrifuge springs to life
The centrifuge spins the two dozen vials slowly at first
Linda and Matt are on top of the elevator
Linda's hands search the wall
Bar fingers run across the smooth metal surface
From the little light below she can see a maintenance ladder that spans the entire height of the vertical tube
They look up and see it disappear into the darkness
Climb
But
Climb
Matt starts up, rung after rung
Linda climbs right behind him
The centrifuge spins faster and faster
The vials are starting to rattle
Linda and Matt pull themselves up the ladder as quick as they can
can't
'm going to pass out
Keep moving
He does, through sheer force of will
Blood from his wound drips down on Linda's face
No telling how much further they have to go in this darkness
Light leaks in from the maintenance hatch below
The centrifuge's whine has reached a fevered pitch
The vials shake violently
Then
one of the vials shatters
rips through the laboratory
The  rips through the lab doors rolls down the tunnel swallowing everything in its path
One of the phase shifted animals gets caught in the flames
We see its shape briefly before it disappears In a wall of fire
The ladder begins to shake
The entire shaft begins to rumble
Linda pushes Matt up as they scramble toward safety
The  blows into the vent
Starts rolling down it also
More explosions
rolls toward the
Slamming into it
The elevator flies upward
The rumbling worsens
The two desperately cling to the ladder
They looks down to see
The elevator
flying up toward them, lifted by the explosion's
Oh God
Don't look
The carriage accelerates toward them, faster and faster
Its loose cables whip around the shaft, slapping the walls around the pair
Its gonna hit them
Linda pulls herself close to the ladder and closes her eyes
She's pressed against Matt
The elevator
50 feet
40
30
W0000000SH
It flames
When Linda opens her eyes, the elevator is and a wall of fire is below them, closing in
Move
Panicked, Linda pushes Matt up the ladder as she stares down at the rising fire wall
But the fire dissipates before it hits them, though a stray tongue of flames reaches up to lick the soles of her feet
They hear a terrifying moan and looks up to see the elevator peaking far above her
It slows to a stop and It's coming down
Coming back toward them in complete free- fall
It's emergency brakes clamp down, slowing it
Metal against metal
Sparks flying
One of the brakes shears
Then another
The elevator unseats from it's tracks,  against the walls as it
Linda sees that the elevator is out of control, and watches as it ping-pongs toward them
smashing into the access ladder, smashing into the wall
The elevator slows, but continues slamming side-to-side
Linda cringes as the elevator crashes into the wall above them
But it jams there, stopping
They pull their heads away from wall and look up
The elevator just hangs there, suspended
There's a small crawlspace between the elevator and the ladder
'mon
Before it slips
They begins to climb up again
Matt shimmies through the tight hollow, and squeezes out the other side, followed by Linda
She breathes a sigh of relief and just hangs there a moment when
Ah
Something grabs her
singed throbbing hand emerges from the darkness, gripping at her leg
(cont'd) It's him
She kicks at it and sees a dark dirty face - a swirl of dirt, grime and smoke with hollow eyes - rise up the ladder
Sebastian, you fuck
Get off me
Sebastian pulls himself up Linda's body
Translucent dirty hands paving at the fabric of her clothes
Linda tries to climb with this thing on her
But Sebastian grabs her around the neck
She begins choking for breath
Linda fights to keep her grip on the ladder
She looks down at the ten foot drop to the elevator and then
She lets go
No
She and Sebastian plummet through the smoky haze and slam against the top of the elevator
Linda seems to hover a few above the elevator, Sebastian's shadowy outline below her
Matt painfully lowers himself down the ladder
But metal groans and the elevator drops another five feet
Linda struggles to her feet
Sebastian rises
menacing dark figure stalking toward her
Linda pushes back from him
Sebastian grabs her by the hair and pulls bar over to the ladder
The elevator strains and groans
Let go of me
Sebastian presses her up against the ladder
Presses into her from behind
He has her trapped
His dirty hand reaches out and strokes her hair
Remember the day we met
You were wearing a red dress and you were so pretty
Now
Now look at you
Get off of her
Sebastian pulls her hair back and kisses her neck with his filthy, dirt-smeared mouth and half-burned away face
(cont'd) Sebastian, stop it
Linda and Sebastian struggle
Matt reaches down to try and grab her, help her
You fucked it all up
Linda looks at her feet
The last elevator emergency brake grips its cable
She grits her tooth and grabs hold of the ladder
Go to hell
Linda stamps on the brake release
The along with Sebastian
It slams into the fiery abyss a hundred yards below
Linda hangs, one hand holding onto the ladder, the other holding onto Matt
Matt pulls her back onto the ladder, using all his remaining strength
- Linda and Matt stumble out into the blazing sunshine
Emergency crews close from all directions, sirens roaring
trail of smoke drifts higher and higher into the sky
An ambulance pulls up next to them and the paramedics hop out, immediately putting a blanket around her and treating Matt's wounds
What happened
We lived
Linda looks over her shoulder at the traces of the ruin and she sees a shimmer of heat rising from the ground
almost as if something was there
