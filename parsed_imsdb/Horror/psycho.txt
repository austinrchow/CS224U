It is early afternoon, a hot mid-summer day
The city is sun-sunblanched white and its drifted-up noises are muted in blanched their own echoes
We fly low, heading in a downtown direction, passing over traffic-clogged streets, parking lots, white business buildings, neatly patterned residential districts
As we approach downtown section, the character of the city begins to change
It is darker and shabby with age and industry
We see railroad tracks, smokestacks, wholesale fruit-and- vegetable markets, old municipal buildings, empty lots
vegetable The very geography seems to give us a climate of nefariousness, of back-doorness, dark and shadowy
And secret
We fly lower and faster now, as if seeking out a specific location
skinny, high old hotel comes into view
On its exposed brick side great painted letters advertise "Transients- Low Weekly Rates-Radio in Every Room
" We pause long enough to establish the shoddy character of this hotel
Its open, curtainless windows, its silent resigned look so characteristic of such hole-and-corner hotels
We move forward with purposefulness and-toward a certain window
The sash is raised as high as it can go, but the shade is pulled down to three or four inches of the inside sill, as if the occupants of the room within wanted privacy but needed air
We are close now, so that only the lower half of the window frame is in shot
No sounds come from within the room
Suddenly, we tip downward, go to the narrow space between shade and sill, peep into the room
young woman is stretched out on the mussed bed
She wears a full slip, stockings, no shoes
She lies in and attitude of physical relaxation, but her face, seen in the dimness of the room, betrays a certain inner-tension, worrisome conflicts
She is  , an tension, attractive girl nearing the end of her twenties and her rope
man stands beside the bed, only the lower half of his figure visible
We hold on this tableau for a long moment, then start forward
As we pass under the window shade, : - () small room, a slow fan buzzing on a shelf above the narrow bed
card of hotel rules is pasted on the mirror above the bureau
An unopened suitcase and a woman's large, straw open- top handbag are on the bureau
On the table beside the bed there are a container of Coco- Cola and an unwrapped, untouched egg-salad sandwich
There is no radio
The man standing by the bed, wearing only trousers, -shirt and sox, is  , a good-looking, sensual shirt man with warm humorous eyes and a compelling smile
He is blotting his neck and face with a thin towel, and is staring down at Mary, a small sweet smile playing about his mouth
Mary keeps her face turned away from him
After a moment, Sam drops the towel, sits on the bed, leans over and takes Mary into his arms, kisses her long and warmly, holds her with a firm possessiveness
The kiss is disturbed and finally interrupted by the buzzing closeness of an inconsiderate fly
Sam smiles, pulls away enough to allow Mary to relax again against the pillow
He studies her, frowns at her unresponsiveness, then speaks in a low, intimate, playful voice
Never did eat your lunch, did you
Mary looks at his smile, has to respond, pulls him to her, kisses him
Then, and without breaking the kiss, she swings her legs over the side of the bed, toe-searches around, finds her shoes, slips her feet into searches them
And finally pulls away and sits up
better get back to the office
These extended lunch hours give my boss excess acid
She rises, goes to the bureau, takes a pair of small earrings out of her bag, begins putting them on, not bothering or perhaps not wanting to look at herself in the mirror
Sam watches her, concerned but unable to inhibit his cheery, humorous good mood
Throughout remainder of this scene, they occupy themselves with dressing, hair-combing, etc
Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off
It's Friday anyway
and hot
(soft sarcasm) What do  do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport
(meaningfully) We could laze around here a while longer
Checking out time is three
Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up
(a small anguish) Sam,  hate having to be with you in a place like this
've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels
They say it
(interrupting) When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately
You sure talk like a girl who's been married
Sam
'm sorry, Mary
(after a moment) My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it
' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it
've lost my girlish laughter
(observing) The only girlish thing you have lost
(a meaningful quiet, then, with difficulty:) Sam
This is the last time
For what
This
Meeting you in secret so we can be
secretive
You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and
wish you wouldn't even come
Okay
What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters
(about to argue, then turning away) haven't time to argue
'm a working girl
And 'm a working man
We're a regular working-class tragedy
(he laughs) It is tragic
Or it will be
if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here
(interrupting, seriously) You can't laugh at it, huh
Can you
Sure
It's like laughing through a broken jaw, but
He breaks off, his cheeriness dissolved, goes to the window, tries to raise the shade
It sticks
He pulls at it
It comes down entirely, and the hot sun glares into the room, revealing it in all its shabbiness and sordidness as if corroborating Mary's words and attitude
Sam kicks at the fallen shade, laughs in frustration, grabs on to his humor again
And besides, when you say  make tax- deductible excuses you make me out a criminal
(having to smile) You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime
wish  were
Not an active criminal but
a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal
(goes close to mary, touches her) Next best thing to no conscience at all
(pulling away) have to go, Sam
can come down next week
No
Not even just to see you, to have lunch
in public
We can see each other, we can even have dinner
but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three
And after the steak
do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall
Sam
No
(after a pause, simply) All right
She stares at him, surprised at his willingness to continue the affair on her terms, as girls are so often surprised when they discover men will continue to want them even after the sexual bait has been pulled in
Sam smiles reassuringly, places his hands gently on her arms, speaks with gentle and simple sincerity
Mary, whenever it's possible, tax- deductible or not,  want to see deductible you
And under any conditions
(a smile) Even respectability
You make respectability sound
disrespectful
(brightly) 'm all for it
It requires patience and temperance and a lot of sweating- out
otherwise, though, it's only hard work
(a pause) But if  can see you, touch you even as simply as this
won't mind
He moves away and again the weight of his pain and problems crushes away his good humor
There is a quiet moment
'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there
sweat to pay off my father's debts
and he's in his grave
sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere
(a smile) pay, too
They also pay who meet in hotel rooms
couple of years and the debts will be paid off
And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops
and then
haven't even been married once yet
Yeah, but when you do
you'll swing
(smiling, then with a terrible urgency) Sam, let's go get married
And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale
We'll have a lot of laughs
When  send my ex-wife her money, you can lick the stamps
(a deep desperation) 'll lick the stamps
He looks at her, long, pulls her close, kisses her lightly, looks out the window and stares at the wide sky
You know what 'd like
clear, empty sky
and a plane, and us in it
and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our
shoes on
And the wherewithal to buy what 'd like
(he moves away, suddenly serious) Mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available
'm thinking of it
(a cheerful shout) How can you even think a thing like that
(picking up handbag, starting for door) Don't miss your plane
Hey, we can leave together can't we
(at door) 'm late
and you have to put your shoes on
Mary goes out quickly, closing door behind her
As Sam stares down at his shoeless feet, : - () - Shooting down at hotel entrance
Mary comes out, walks quickly to a parked cab, gets in
The cab zooms up the awful street
: - () small, moderately successful office off the main street cab pulls up at the curb
We see Mary get out of cab, pay driver, cross pavement to the office door
- () Mary enters office, crosses to her desk, sits down, rubs her temples, finally looks over at Caroline, a girl in the last of her teens
Isn't Mr
Lowery back from lunch
(a high, bright, eager- to-talk voice laced to-with a vague Texan accent) He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property, you know, that oil lease man
so that's why he's late
(a pause, then, as Mary does not respond to the pointed thrust) You getting a headache
It'll pass
Headaches are like resolutions
you forget them soon as they stop hurting
You got aspirins
have something
not aspirins, but (cheerfully takes bottle of pills out of desk drawer) my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding
(laughs) Teddy was furious when he found out 'd taken tranquilizers
She rises, starts for Mary's desk, pills in hand
Were there any calls
Teddy called
Me
And my mother called to see if Teddy called
Oh, and your sister called to say she's going to Tucson to do some buying and she'll be gone the whole weekend and
She breaks off, distracted by the  of the door opening
and his oil-lease client,   enter the office
Lowery is a pleasant, worried-faced man, big and a trifle pompous
Cassidy is very faced loud and has a lunch- hour load on
He is a gross man, exuding a kind of pitiful vulgarity
Wow
Hot as fresh milk
You girls should get your boss to air-condition you up
He can afford it today
Lowery flashes an embarrassed smile at Mary, tries to lead Cassidy toward the private office
Mary, will you get those copies of the deed ready for Mr
Cassidy
Cassidy pauses beside Mary's desk, hooks a haunch onto the desktop, smiles a wet smile at Mary
Tomorrow's the day
My sweet little girl
(laughs as Mary looks up at him) Not you, my daughter
baby, and tomorrow she stands up there and gets her sweet self married away from me
(pulling out wallet) want you to look at my baby
Eighteen years old
and she's never had an unhappy day in any one of those years
(flashes photo) Mary glances, cannot bring herself to smile or make some remark, continues sorting out the deed copies, tries to ignore the man's hot-breath closeness
Come on, Tom, my office is air- conditioned
(ignoring Lowery) You know what  do with unhappiness
buy it off
You unhappy
Not inordinately
(puts deed copy into Cassidy's too-close hand) 'm buying this house for my baby's wedding present
Forty thousand dollars, cash
Now that ain't buying happiness, that's buying off unhappiness
That penniless punk she's marryin'
(laughs) Probably a good kid
it's just that  hate him
(looks at deed) Yup
Forty thousand, says here
(to Lowery) Casharoonie
He takes out of his inside pocket, two separate bundles of new $100 bills and throws them onto the desk, under Mary's nose
Caroline's eyes go wide at the sight of the glorious green bundles of bills, and she comes close to the desk
Cassidy leans terribly close to Mary, flicks through the bills, laughs wickedly
never carry more than  can afford to lose
(closer to Mary) Count 'em
(shocked, worried) Tom
cash transactions of this size
Most irregular
So what
It's my private money
(laughs, winks, elbows Lowery) And now it's yours
(staring at the money) declare
(whispering) don't
That's how 'm able to keep it
(laughs) (hastily interrupting) Suppose we just put this in the safe and then Monday morning when you're feeling good
Speakin' of feeling good, where's that bottle you said you had in your desk
(laughs, as if having given away Lowery's secret) Oops
(to Mary, patting her arm) Usually  can keep my mouth shut
He rises, reels toward Lowery's office, pauses, turns, speaks to Mary, meaningfully
Honest
can keep any private transaction a secret
any pri
(stopped by Mary's cold gaze) Lowery
'm dyin' of thirstaroonie
Lowery starts after him, pauses, turns to Mary
Cassidy has gone into Lower's office
(quietly) don't even want it in the office over the weekend
Put it in the safe deposit box, at the bank, Mary
And we'll get him to give us a check on Monday - instead
He starts quickly away when it looks like Cassidy is going to come and pull him bodily into the office
When the men are gone and the door is closed, Caroline picks up a bundle, smiles at it
He was flirting with you
guess he noticed my wedding ring
Mary has put one bundle into a large envelope and takes the other from Caroline
When the bills are away, she puts the filled envelope in her handbag, notices the remaining deed copies on her desk, picks them up, goes to the private office door, knocks, starts to open door as: (
) Come in
'   - () Mary opens door, looks in
Cassidy is drinking from a large tumbler, winks at her without pausing in his drinking
Mary remains on threshold a moment, then crosses to the desk, talking as she goes
The copies
Mr
Lowery, if you don't mind, 'd like to go right on home after the bank
have a slight
You go right home
Me and your boss are going out to get ourselves a little drinkin' done
(to Lowery) Right
(to Mary) Of course
You feeling ill
headache
You need a week-end in Las Vegas
playground of the world
'm going to spend this week-end in bed
(starts out) (to Lowery) Only playground that beats Las Vegas
Mary goes back out into the outer office, closes door
- () Mary goes to her desk, takes the handbag, checks to make sure the money-filled envelope is tucked well down into it
During this: Aren't you going to take the pills
(as Mary shakes her head) They'll knock that headache out
don't need pills
just sleep
She goes to the door
: '  - () double bed in the foreground
We just see the far side as the   across
Mary enters the scene, clad only in her slip
Perhaps she is about to get into bed
Behind her is an open closet, but too dark inside for us to see any contents
As Mary turns to the closet the   to show a close view of the $40,000 in the envelope on our side of the bed
Mary takes a dress from the closet and starts to put it on as the   to reveal a packed but not yet closed suitcase also on the bed
Mary zips up her dress and then brings some final garments from the closet
She comes around to the suitcase and puts them on the top
Mary works with haste and in tension, as if acting on an impulse which might vanish as quickly as it came
The suitcase filled now, she checks around the room, then takes her handbag to the bed, puts in the money-filled envelope, and then slams the suitcase shut
Then filled she looks at her small bedroom desk, goes to it, removes a small file-envelope from one of the drawers
It is one of those brown envelopes in which one keeps important papers and policies and certificates
She checks its contents briefly, puts it on the bed, opens another desk drawer, takes out her bank book, tosses it on the bed
Then she packs both the file-envelope and the bank book, into her handbag, takes one quick last look around the room, picks up the handbag and the suitcase and goes out of the room
: '  - () two-car garage
One car is gone
Mary's car is parked in the driveway
The  is low enough so that we can easily read the Arizona number plate in the foreground
Mary comes out of house, starts for the trunk, intending to put the suitcase in, changes her mind, places the suitcase and her handbag on the front seat, gets in, starts the car, begins to back out of driveway
: - () We are close on Mary's car, shooting in at her troubled, guilty face
She seems to be driving with that excess care of one who does not wish to be stopped for a minor traffic irregularity
She stops for a red light at a main intersection
'  - () We see Lowery and Cassidy crossing the street, passing right in front of Mary's car
'  - () Mary freezes
- () Cassidy, glancing into car, sees Mary, lets out a cheery exclamation, elbows Lowery
Lowery turns, sees Mary, smiles pleasantly, pulls Cassidy on
'  - () Mary watches the entire exchange with a look of stony horror on her face
- () Now we look closely at Lowery
As he reaches the curb, a small confusion brightens his face
He remembers that Mary intended to "spend the weekend in bed
" He considers, curiously, turns, looks back at her, a slight frown on his face
'  - () Mary sees the pause and the look
- () For a moment it even looks as if Lowery might be meaning to cross back to the car
'  - () Mary's tension is unbearable
And at that moment we hear the shrill shriek of the traffic cop's whistle
Mary zooms the car away
: - () Mary in car, driving, safely away from town
Her look is less tense now, and more purposeful
After a moment, she checks the fuel gauge, frowns, looks along highway for a gas station
: '  - () Approaching and leaving city limits
- () Looks at gas gauge
- () - () We see Mary's car drive in, come to a stop
There are no other cars about, this being a gas station off the main highway, and the attendant is obviously in the shack
Mary looks worried about having to make this stop, keeps her face turned away from the shack, not wishing it to be seen
No one comes and for a moment Mary considers driving on, as if the emptiness of the station were a warning, an omen that she should listen to
But the gas registers almost empty
She has to blow her horn
comes out of the shack, starts toward her car
At that moment, we  the  of the  in the shack
The Attendant walks a few steps further, toward Mary's car, then decides to go back and answer the phone
The phone's insistent ringing unnerves Mary
She starts her car, zooms off
We see the Attendant, phone in hand, in the doorway of shack
He looks after the departing car with little or no expression
The car grows smaller as it races up the road
The sun is setting
There is something vaguely ominous about the darkening sky into which the car seems to be disappearing
: - () The oncoming headlights hurt Mary's eyes
She is getting sleepy and her vision is blurring
Her eyes close, involuntarily, snap open again
She stretches than wide, as if forcing them to stay open
The oncoming lights seem to glare to a point beyond endurance
She murmurs "Sam - Sam
" : - () We see Mary's car, dim in the early dawn, tilted on the soft shoulder of the road, looking somehow sad and pathetic, like a child's thrown-away toy
And from this angle it would appear that the car is empty
After a moment, during which there are no other vehicles passing, we see, coming from the far distance, a in a patrol car
He passes Mary's car, notes its apparent emptiness, -turns, comes back up behind the car
He gets out and approaches the driver's side window
'  - () The Patrolman looks down into the car
() Mary turns with a start, sits up, is startled and unnerved by the sight of the Patrolman, and, as if by automatic reflex, turns the ignition and presses down on the starter
() The Patrolman holds up his hand
(startled) Hold it there
Mary slams down on the brake, tries to pull herself together
The Patrolman raps again, less gently
Reluctantly, Mary rolls down the window
The Patrolman studies her for a moment
In quite a hurry
Yes
(because he seems to be awaiting an explanation) didn't mean to sleep so long was afraid 'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness
so  decided to pull over
You slept here all night
(a faint edge of defensiveness) Yes
As  said,  couldn't keep my eyes
(mere concern) There are plenty of motels in this area
You should have
mean, just to be safe
didn't intend to sleep all night
just pulled over
have  broken any laws
No, m'am
Then 'm free to go
(a pause) Is anything wrong
Of course not
Am  acting as if
something's wrong
(almost a smile) Frankly, yes
Please
'd like to go
Is there
Is there what
(not waiting for an answer) 've told you there's nothing wrong
except that 'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time
(interrupting, sternly) Now wait just a moment
Turn your motor off, please
Mary seems about to object, thinks better of it, turns off the ignition
In the course of my duty,  never "take up" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help
Believe that, 'am
(a little softer) Now if you woke up on the wrong side of
the car seat, that's one thing
But when you act as if 've just placed you under arrest
'm sorry
No need to apologize
Mary starts the car, her face turned as if she wishes the matter were all settled and the Patrolman had already gone
The Patrolman isn't exactly one of those civil servants who demands a thank-you, but he does feel her manner is a bit too abrupt
He calls: Wait a minute
(jamming down the brake) Now what
The Patrolman gazes at her a moment, then: May  see your license
Why
Please
Mary pulls her handbag up from the floor, where she'd placed it when she stretched out for sleep
She puts her hand in it, rummages for her wallet, cannot find it
The Patrolman is staring at her
She glances at him nervously, pokes in her bag a bit more, sighs, realizes she'll have to remove some of its contents
Nervously, badly controlling her fear, she takes out the money-filled envelope, and then the important papers envelope, filled then a couple of other items, places them on the seat, finally finds her wallet, opens it, hands it to him
He looks at the wallet, then at the car
- () The Patrolman walks around to the front of the car, checks the license plate, and returns
'  - () The Patrolman peers in, checks the car registration on the steering wheel, returns Mary's wallet
She takes it, looks at him for a flicker of a moment
He says nothing
She starts ahead, fast
- () The Patrolman stares after Mary as she drives off, then starts back to his automobile
- () She is quite shaken, realizes she caused herself a great deal of trouble and placed herself in unnecessary danger
She is disturbed and angry and frightened at her inability to act normally under the pressure of guilt
As she drives, she glances into her rear-view mirror
' -  - () The Patrolman is following in his automobile, keeping behind her at a matched speed
- () She glances out at her surroundings
'  - () The Freeway ahead
'  - () She suddenly turns off the highway
- () She checks her mirror
' -  - () The Patrolman is no longer following, has not turned off after her
- () She breathes a sigh of relief, thinks a moment, makes a quick decision
: - () The big sign reads "California Charlie - Automobile Paradise
" We see Mary's car drive onto the lot and stop
Mary gets out of the car, glances toward the lot office, turns her attention to the line of cars, notice the California licence plates on all of them
The   calls out from his office: With you in a second
Mary nods, starts walking along the line of cars as if making a selection
Her eye is caught by the iron newspaper stand on the corner, just outside the lot
She stares at the papers, turns away, as if what she is fearing would have to be impossible, then, having to satisfy herself, goes to the stand, drops a dime in the iron slot, picks up a   newspaper, starts back into the car lot as she glances worried at the front page
As she goes, we see, coming up the street toward the lot, the same He sees Mary, slows, swerves over to the opposite side of the street, stops by the curb
Mary, engrossed in the newspaper, and walking back ease the lot, does not see the Patrolman
The car dealer is out on the lot now, standing and waiting for Mary
As she approaches, lost in her newspaper, he smiles
'm in no mood for trouble
(glancing up, thrown for a moment) What
(cheerfully) There's an old saying, "First customer of the day is always the most trouble
" But like  said, 'm in no mood for it so 'm just going to treat you so fair and square you won't have one human reason to give me
(interrupting) Can  trade in my car and take another
You can do anything you've a mind to
and bein' a woman, you will
(chin-indicating her car) That yours
Yes, it's
nothing wrong with it, 'm just
Sick of the sight of it
(laughs) Well, suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile 'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and
want some coffee
was just about
No
Thank you
'm in
a hurry just want to make a change and start
She stops suddenly, almost with a gasp
She has seen the Patrolman
- '  - () He is staring over at her, his face dispassionate
- () Mary has to force herself to look away
One thing people never ought to be when they're buying a used car is in a hurry
(starting away toward her car) But like  said, too nice a day for arguing
'll just shoot this into the garage
He starts into Mary's car
She looks at him, in near panic, wanting to skip the whole thing
Torn, wondering if the presence of the Patrolman doesn't negate the value of changing cars, wondering how she can get away, wondering if she'll be followed, or if the Patrolman will go away if she does stay here
All these panic-fears rush her mind and she can do nothing
The Car Dealer has driven her car into the garage
She stands in the middle of the lot, feeling like a shooting target
She looks toward the garage
- '  - () Mary's car is in it
- () Mary decides she cannot back out now without arousing further suspicion, is compelled to look again at the Patrolman
- '  - () He still watches
With a self-angry sigh of resignment, she goes to a close car, looks at it
The Car Dealer is returning
That's the one 'd've picked for you myself
How much
Go ahead
Spin it around the block
Now  know you don't know anything about engine condition, but you can feel, can't you
and it's all in the feel, believe me, you feel that one around the block
It looks fine
How much will it be, with my car
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over
(laughs) You are in a hurry
Somebody chasin' you
Of course not
Please
Well
heck, this is the first time ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman
(laughs, sees she is in no mood for it) 'd figure roughly
(looks at the car, then back at the garage) your car plus five hundred
Five hundred
Aha
Always got time to argue money, huh
All right
As the car dealer looks at her in amazement, she reaches into her bag, feels the money-filled envelope, pauses
(slowly) take it
you can prove that car's yours
mean, out of state and all
got your pink slip and your
think  have the necessary papers
Is there a Ladies Room
In the building
(indicates, continues to stare quietly) Mary starts for the building, glancing once in the direction of the Patrolman
- '  - () He still sits, his motor throbbing, his face quiet
- () Mary goes into the office building
: - () Mary enters, locks door, takes envelope out of her handbag, extracts one bundle of bills from the envelope, counts off five, puts the bundle back into the envelope and the envelope back into the bag
Then she remembers, takes out the important papers envelope, goes through it, finds several papers having to do with her car, takes them all out, puts back the envelope, starts out of the ladies Room
: - () The Car Dealer has moved the car of her choice out of the line
It stands in the clearing
(too cheerfully) think you'd better give it a trial spin
Don't want any bad word of mouth about California Charlie
'd really rather not
Please
Can't we just settle this and
'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am
It's not that  don't trust you, but
(interrupting) But what
Is there anything so terribly wrong about
making a decision and wanting to hurry
Do you think 've stolen
my car
No, 'am
was only about to say, 've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test
that's all
(handing him the ownership papers and the new bills) 'd like to be ready when he gets back
Okay
If you'll come along
He starts toward the office building
Mary follows, closely, anxiously
She glances, sees: - '  - () He is still at the far curb
- () The Car Dealer goes into his office
Mary follows
- () second later, he starts his automobile, checks traffic, comes across the street, slowly, and drives onto the lot
He pauses a moment, then drives across the lot, passing the office, going on to the other exit, stops there as Mary's car is driven back onto the lot
The  stops Mary's car, hops out, waves to the Patrolman
The Patrolman waves back, goes on a bit until he is behind Mary's car, stops again, looks over at the office
In a moment, Mary comes out, hurries across to her new car, gets in, starts the motor
The Mechanic yells: Hey
Miss
Mary pauses, turns, sees the Patrolman, then the Mechanic
Her face goes white
She doesn't know which man called her
Then the Mechanic waves, starts forward with her suitcase
(as Mechanic reaches car) Just put it right in here, please
beside me
The Mechanic smiles, throws the suitcase in
Mary zooms off
As she drives out of lot we see the Mechanic, the Car Dealer and the Patrolman all looking after her
: Mary is driving tensely
She checks the rear-view mirror, is more shocked than pleased when she sees
' - No sign of the Patrolman
She turns her face, looks out at the highway
99 - ' It is heavy with traffic
Again she checks the mirror and although
' - There is still no sign of the Patrolman
She cannot relax or feel safe, cannot convince herself that nothing will come of the man's watching and suspicions
on Mary's face now, recording her anxiety, her fears
Her guilt shines bright in her eyes and she is a person unaccustomed to containing this much guilt in this realistic a situation
Suddenly, we hear the  of the Used Car Dealer's laugh, hear it as clearly as Mary hears it in her imagination
The "imagined voice" we hear is actually the voice of the Car Dealer: ' Heck, Officer, that was the first time  ever saw the Customer high- pressure the Salesman
Somebody chasing her
' better have a look at those papers, Charlie
' She look like a wrong-one to you
' Acted like one
Mary blinks, shakes her head, as if trying to shake away these voices of her imagination
She checks the rear-view mirror
' - Still no sight of the Patrolman
She tries to force herself to relax, almost succeeds when she is sprung to tension again by
The sight of a police car
As she drives past, we hear the squeaky, unintelligible voice coming over the car radio
Mary zooms down on the gas, whizzes ahead
: 99 - Mary's car dashing along
: Mary looks weary, tired with strain and with hard driving
Her eyes are heavy with worry and deep thought
We can see that it is much later in the day, almost dusk
We  the sound of an agitated  of an intercom system, a sound emanating from Mary's imagination
After the second , we  the voice of Caroline
' Yes, Mr
Lowery
' (a worried tone) Caroline
Mary still isn't in
' No, Mr
Lowery
but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings
' Buzz me the minute she comes in
Again Mary shakes her head, forces herself to stop hearing these "invented" scenes of her imagination
Now we cut to the view of the road, from Mary's viewpoint
Darkness of evening is coming
In the dim twilight we see the neon sign of roadside restaurants and gas stations beginning to blaze on
' Back on Mary's face, and after a moment, the imagined voices again: ' Call her sister
If no one's answering at the house
' called her sister, Mr
Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know
And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do
' You better run out to the house
She may be
unable to answer the phone
' Her sister's going to do that
She's as worried as we are
flush of painful guilt and regret rises up in Mary's face
She closes her eyes for one tight swift moment
We cut again to the highway
The first oncoming headlights slash at the windshield
' Cutting back to Mary, we can sense by the tense muscles of her face that she is driving faster
The oncoming headlights blurt at her
Suddenly we  Lowery's voice, loud now and frightened, as if the anxiety in the man's voice was strong enough to break through Mary's effort to keep her mind silent and her imagination blank
' No
haven't the faintest idea
As said,  last saw your sister when she left this office on Friday
she said she didn't feel well and wanted to leave early and  said she could
And that was the last  saw
(a pause, a thought) wait a minute,  did see her, an hour or so later, driving
(a pause, then with solemn fear) Ah,  think you'd better come over here to my office
Quick
(a pause, a click) Caroline, get Mr
Cassidy for me
It is completely dark now, night
' We cut back to her face
' After all, Cassidy,  told you
all that cash
'm not taking the responsibility
Oh, for heaven's sake, a girl works for you for ten years, you trust her
All right, yes, you better come over
' ' Fast cut back to Mary's face
Oncoming headlights throw a blinding light across her features
' (undrunk, sharp with rage) Well  ain't about to kiss off forty thousand dollars
'll get it back and if any of it's missin' 'll replace it with her fine soft flesh
'll track her, never you doubt it
' Hold on, Cassidy
still can't believe
it must be some kind of a mystery
can't
' You checked with the bank, no
They never laid eyes on her, no
You still trustin'
Hot creepers, she sat there while  dumped it out
hardly even looked at it, plannin' and
and even flirtin' with me
look of revulsion makes Mary close her eyes
Big drops of rain begin to appear
- She is becoming aware of the rain starting
The rain increasing and backlit by the oncoming headlights
- Mary starts the windshield wipers
The wipers are having a battle with the now torrential rain
- Peering through the blurred windshield
- slowing down in the flooding highway
- peering through the windshield
The oncoming lights are fewer
- almost coming to a slow turn
just blackness and rain
- peering
' An almost undiscernible light in the far distance, a neon sign blurred by the rain-sheeted windshield
' She presses down, forces the car to move on through the flooded road
As we move closer, we see the neon sign more clearly and can faintly make out the large letters which read "Motel
"  Mary stops the car, lowers the window slightly, looks out
We see the sign clearly now: "
" Mary opens the car door and dashes out into the rain and up onto the porch of the motel office
'  - () Mary pauses on the porch
The lights are on within the office
She tries door, finds it open, goes into office her into office
There is no one present
Mary goes to the desk, rings a small pushbell
There is no response
Mary rubs her forehead in weariness and frustration, goes back out onto the porch
She looks off in another direction, slightly behind the office, and sees
'  -     - () path from the motel office leads directly up to this house
There is a light on in one of the upstairs rooms passes the window, pauses, peers out
We see her in clear silhouette
She quickly goes away from the window
'  - () Mary, having seen the woman, expects now that she will get some attention
She stands a few moments, waiting
No one comes
Impatience and anger rise in Mary
She dashes out into the rain, to her car, gets in, opens the side window, begins to honk the horn
After a moment, a   open the front door of the house, pauses, starts down the path
After a few steps, he turns and runs back into the house
Mary leaves her car, starts a dash for the shelter of the porch
As she runs, we see that the Young Man has gone back only to get an umbrella
Seeing that Mary is on her way to the porch, he runs quickly, the umbrella unopened in his hand
He gets to the porch a moment after Mary has reached it
He stops short, looks at her, then at the umbrella hanging useless in his hand, then back to her
There is something sadly touching in his manner, in his look
Mary's impatience goes and she smiles and this makes him almost smile
He gestures her into the office, standing back to indicate that he will go after her
She goes into the office
'  - () The Young Man follows Mary in, closes the door
He is , somewhere in his late twenties, thin and tall, soft- spoken and hesitant
Dirty night
(not really a question) You have a vacancy
(simply, almost cheerfully) We have twelve vacancies
Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies
(a pause) They moved away the highway
thought 'd gotten off the main
knew you must have
No one stops here anymore unless they do
He is behind the counter now, pushing forward the registration book
But it's no good dwelling on our losses, is it
We go right ahead lighting signs and following the formalities
Would you sign, please
Mary has placed her handbag on the counter
She takes the registration book, picks up the pen, is suddenly struck with the realization that she'd better use an alias
She writes the name Marie Samuels
Your home address
Oh, just the town will do
(glancing at newspaper sticking out of her handbag) Los Angeles
She realizes he didn't ask her to tell him, merely to write it down
She smiles, writes Los Angeles beside the false name
Norman smiles, stops smiling out of embarrassment
Cabin One
It's closer in case you want anything
right next to the office
- He removes a key for Cabin One
We see that there is a remaining key on the board
- want sleep more than anything
Except maybe, food
There's a big diner about ten miles on up
just outside Fairvale
Am  that close to Fairvale
Fifteen miles
'll get your bags
He goes to door, opens it
The rain has slowed down considerably
He smiles at this fact, as if to communicate some pleasure he finds in it
Mary follows him to the door, goes out on the porch, waits and watches as Norman runs to her car, gets in, drives it to the parking space in front of Cabin One
Mary walks along the porch, waits before the door of Cabin One
Norman gets out of car, with suitcase, runs to the door, opens it, pushes the door open, puts his hand in and switches on a light
Mary goes into the cabin
Norman follows her
- () Norman places suitcase on bed, goes to the window, opens it
Stuffy in here
(turns to her) Well
the mattress is soft and there're hangers in the closet and
stationary with "Bates' Motel" printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious
and
the
over there
(he points to the bathroom, fairly blushes) The bathroom
(quickly, starting to leave) 'll be in the office if you want anything
just tap on the wall
Thank you, Mr
Bates
Norman Bates
He pauses at the door, gazes at her
She smiles
You have something most girls never have
have
There's no name for it
But it's something that, that puts a person at ease
Thank you
Again
(not really a question) You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you
No
Then will you do me a favor
(without waiting for her response) Will you have supper here
was just about to, myself
nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but 'd like it if you'd come up to the house and
don't set a fancy table but
the kitchen's awful homey
'd like to
All right, you get your dresses hanging out and
change those wet shoes, and 'll come for you soon as it's ready
(starts out) with my trusty umbrella
(he laughs a small laugh, runs off) Mary closes the door, goes to suitcase, opens it, starts to take out a dress
Her handbag is next to the suitcase
She glances down into it, pauses, drops the dress, reaches into the handbag, takes out the money-filled envelope, stares at it, almost with regret, filled contemplates hiding it, decides to, starts looking for a reasonable hiding place
She looks about, at the closet, the drawers etc
, realizes all such places are obvious
Catching sight of the newspaper in her bag, she hits on a solution
She opens the newspaper, places the envelope within it, lock-folds the paper again and then places it on the bedside table as if it were there for later reading
She considers this for a moment, accepts it, goes to her suitcase to start unpacking
Suddenly the quiet is shattered by the shrill, ugly sound of a woman's voice, raised in anger
' No
tell you no
Mary walks slowly to the window, realizing that the terrible voice is coming from the house behind the cabins her to window and once there we see the light is still on in the upstairs bedroom and the voice is coming from that room
The rain has stopped and the moon is out
' won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper
(an ugly, sneering note creeps into the voice) by candlelight,  suppose, in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap, erotic minds
' Mother, please
' And then what
After supper, music
Whispers
' Mother, she's just a stranger
hungry, and the weather's bad
' (mimicking cruelly) Mother, she's just a stranger
(hard, cruel again) As if men don't desire strangers, as if
oh,  refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me
You understand, Boy
' (pause) Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food
or my son
Or do  have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts
Huh, boy
You have the guts, boy
' (blurted cut fury and shame) Shut up
Shut up
There is the  of a door closing in that room up there
Mary has stood by the window, listening with mounting distress and concern and sympathy
She turns her face away now, gazes sadly at the little empty room
In a moment there is the  of the house's front door slamming shut
Mary turns, looks out the window
'  - () We see Norman coming down the path, carrying a napkin-covered tray
- () Mary looks at him for a moment, then turns quickly, goes to the door, opens it and goes out onto the porch
- () Mary pauses outside the door, is about to start forward when Norman comes round the building and walks along the porch, past the office, stopping only when he is close to her
He stares with painful embarrassment at the knowing look in her eye
've caused you some trouble
Mother
(a hollow little laugh, an attempt at sardonic humor) what is the phrase
"she isn't herself today"
think that's it
(looking at the tray) You shouldn't have bothered
really don't have that much of an appetite
Norman flinches, realizing she has heard his mother's reference to Mary's appetite
'm sorry
wish
people could apologize for other people
Don't worry about it
(a warm smile) But as long as you've made us supper, we may as well eat it
Huh
She begins to back into her room
Norman starts to follow, hesitates as he sees the total picture of an attractive young woman and a motel room
Bringing down the tray of food, in defiance of his mother's orders, is about the limit of his defiance for one day
He cannot go into Mary's room
It might be nicer
warmer in the office
Without waiting for approval or disapproval, he turns, hurries to the office
Mary looks after him, her face showing amused sympathy, then follows
- () Norman looks about, tray in hand, sees there is no reasonable place to spread out a supper
He turns, sees Mary standing in the doorway
Eating in an office
(a rueful smile) to officious, even for me
have the parlor behind this
if you'd like
Mary nods
Norman walks on, behind the counter and into the darkened parlor
Mary follows
'  -() In the darkened room, lit only by the light from the office spilling in, we see Norman placing the tray on a table
Mary comes to the doorway, pauses
Norman straightens up, goes to lamp, turns on the light
Mary is startled by the room
Even in the dimness of one lamp, the strange, extraordinary nature of the room rushes up at one
It is a room of birds
Stuffed birds, all over the room, on every available surface, one even clinging to the old fashioned fringed shade of the lamp
The birds are of many varieties, beautiful, grand, horrible, preying
Mary stares in awe and a certain fascinated horror
-      - Please sit down
On the sofa
As Norman goes about spreading out the bread and ham and pouring the milk, we follow Mary across the room
She studies the birds as she walks, briefly examines a bookcase stacked with books on the subject of "Taxidermy
" -
- She notices, too, the paintings on the wall; nudes, primarily, and many with a vaguely religious overtone
Finally Mary reaches the sofa, sits down, looks at the spread
You're very
kind
It's all for you
'm not hungry
Please go ahead
Mary begins to eat, her attitude a bit tense
She takes up a small slice of ham, bites off a tiny bite, nibbles at it in the manner of one disturbed and preoccupied
Norman gazes at her, at the tiny bite she has taken, smiles and then laughs
You eat like a bird
You'd know, of course
Not really
hear that expression, that one eats "like a bird," is really a falsie,  mean a falsity, because birds eat a tremendous lot
( pause, then explaining) Oh,  don't know anything about birds
My hobby is stuffing things
taxidermy
And  guess 'd just rather stuff birds because
well,  hate the look of beasts when they're stuffed, foxes and chimps and all
some people even stuff dogs and cats
but  can't
think only birds look well stuffed because they're rather
passive, to begin with
most of them
He trails off, his exuberance failing in the rushing return of his natural hesitancy and discomfort
Mary looks at him, with some compression, smiles
It's a strange hobby
Curious, mean
Uncommon, too
imagine so
It's not as expensive as you'd think
Cheap, really
Needles, thread, sawdust
the chemicals are all that cost anything
(He goes quiet, looks disturbed) man should have a hobby
It's more than a hobby
sometimes
a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it
(after a pause, softly) Is your time so empty
Oh, no
(forcing brightness again) run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother
the ones she allows  might be capable of doing
You go out
with friends
Friends
Who needs friends
(Laughs, then with gallows humor) boy's best friend is his mother
(Stops laughing) You've never had an empty moment in your whole life
Have you
Only my share
Where are you going
don't mean to pry
( wistful smile) 'm looking for a private island
What are you running away from
(Alert) Why do you ask that
No
People never run away from anything
( pause) The rain didn't last very long
(Turning suddenly) You know what  think
think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out
We scratch and claw
but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps
was born in mine
don't mind it anymore
You should
mind it
Oh  do
but  say  don't
(Laughs boyishly) (Staring at him, shaking her head softly
) If anyone ever spoke to me, the way heard
The way she spoke to you, don't think  could ever laugh again
(Controlled resentment) Sometimes when she talks that way to me 'd like to
curse her out and leave her forever
( rueful smile) Or at least, defy her
( pause, a hopeless shrug) But  couldn't
She's ill
She sounded strong
mean
ill
( pause) She had to raise me all by herself after my dad died
was only five
and it must have been a strain
Oh, she didn't have to go out to work or anything, Dad left us with a little something
anyway, a few years ago
Mother met a man
He talked her into building this motel
We could have talked her into anything
and when
Well
It was just too much for her when he died, too
And the way he died
Oh, it's nothing to talk about when you're eating
(Pauses, smiles) Anyway, it was too much of a loss for my mother
she had nothing left
(Critically) Except you
son is a poor substitute for a lover
(Turns away as if in distaste of the word) Why don't you go away
To a private island, like you
No, not like me
It's too late for me
And besides
who'd look after her
She'd be alone up there, the fire would go out
damp and cold, like a grave
When you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them
Oh, don't hate her
hate
what she's become
hate
the illness
(Slowly, carefully) Wouldn't it be better if you put her in
someplace
She hesitates
Norman turns, slowly, looking at her with a striking coldness
An Institution
madhouse
People always call a madhouse "someplace
" (Mimicing coldly) Put her in Someplace
'm sorry
didn't mean it to sound uncaring
(The coldness turning to tight fury) What do you mean about caring
Have you ever seen one of those places
Inside
Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you
and my mother there
Why
has she harmed you
She's as harmless as
one of these stuffed birds
am sorry
only felt
it seemed she was harming you
meant
(High fury now) Well
You meant well
People always mean well, they cluck their thick tongues and shake their heads and suggest so very delicately that
The fury suddenly dies, abruptly and completely, and he sinks back into his chair
There is a brief silence
Mary watches the troubled man, is almost physically pained by his anguish
(Quietly) 've suggested it myself
But  hate to even think such a thing
She needs me
and it isn't
(Looks up with a childlike pleading in his eyes) it isn't as if she were a maniac, a raving thing
it's just that
sometimes she goes a little mad
We all go a little mad sometimes
Haven't you
(After a long thoughtful pause) Yes, and just one time can be enough
(Rises) Thank you
(Cheerfully, correcting) Thank you, Norman
Norman
You're not going to
to your room already
'm very tired
And 'll have a long drive tomorrow
All the way back to Phoenix
Phoenix
stepped into a private trap back there -- and  want to go back and
try to pull myself out
(Looking close at Norman) Before it's too late for me, too
(Looking at her) Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking
'd like to, but
Alright
'll see you in the morning
'll bring you breakfast
What time will you
Very early
Dawn
Alright, Miss
(He has forgotten her name) Crane
That's it
(He frowns, as if bothered by not being able to match the name to the memory of the name in the registration book) Good night
She goes out of the parlor
We see her, from Norman's viewpoint, as she crosses the small office, goes out into the night
Norman turns and looks at the table, and we see his face now
It is bright with that drunken-like look of determination and encouragement and like resolve
He starts to clean up the table, pauses as he hears the closing of Mary's door in the cabin next door
He holds still, listens
He goes into the office and looks at the book
-   "" - He goes back into the parlor with a mystified expression
The sound of Mary moving about her room come over, soft , somehow intimate in the night quiet
Norman turns his ear from the direction of the , seems to be fighting an impulse to listen, or more than listen
But slowly, he is forced to surrender to the impulse and, resisting himself, he goes to the wall, presses the side of his head against it
The  come louder, as if we too had our ear pressed against the wall
Now Norman looks at a picture hanging on the far end of the wall he is leaning against
Slowly he starts toward it
He reaches it, touches it, reluctantly lifts the small frame off the wall
tiny circle of light hits Norman's face, coming from the hole in the wall behind the picture
This end of the room is very dim and thus we are able to see clearly the light striking Norman's face
We move close to Norman, extremely close, until his profile fills the screen
The tiny spot of light hits his eye
See the small hole through which the light comes
Norman peeps through
' Through the hole we look into Mary's cabin, see Mary undressing
She is in her bra and halfslip
She stoops over a bit, places her hands behind her upper back, begins to unhook her bra
- He watches as Mary removes her bra
We see his eye run up and down the unseen figure of Mary
' Mary, just slipping into a robe, covering her complete nudity
He turns from the hole, faces us for a moment, continues turning until he can look out the small parlor window
We see, as he sees
He turns his face away, quickly, resentfully
In his face we see anger and anguish
And then resolve
Quickly, precisely, he rehangs the picture over the hole in the wall, turns, starts out of the parlor
We see him go through the office and out onto the porch, not even bothering to close the door behind him
: - () Norman walking along the porch, in the direction of the big house
Once on the path he pauses, looks up at the light in the bedroom window, then pulls himself up, squares his shoulders, strides manfully up the path
follows behind him
He opens the door of the house, enters
We see him pause at the foot of the stairway, look up at the bedroom door just at the head of the stair
He holds for a moment, and then his resolve and courage evaporates
His shoulders slump, sadly, mournfully
He by- passes the stairs and slowly makes his way to the kitchen
At the far end of the hall
He enters the kitchen, drops wearily into a chair
After a moment, he stretches out a leg and gently pushes the kitchen door closed
: '   - () Mary is seated at the small desk, engrossed in figuring in a small notebook
We see from these figures a calculation which indicates her intention to make a restitution of the money she has used of the forty thousand dollars
We see, too, her bankbook
The paper reads thus: top figure, 40,000; directly beneath it 500, the amount used for the new car; total after subtraction, 39,500
In another spot we see a figure which matches the balance in her bankbook; 624
00
Beneath this is the figure 500, and the amount after subtraction, 124
00
She studies the figures, sighs, not wearily but with a certain satisfaction, with the pleasure that comes when one knows that at any cost one is going to continue doing the right thing
After a moment she tears the page out of the notebook and, rising, begins to rip it into small pieces
She goes into the bathroom, drops the pieces into the toilet bowl, flushes the toilet
Then she drops her robe and steps into the tub and turns the shower on
Over the bar on which hangs the shower curtain, we can see the bathroom door, not entirely closed
For a moment we watch Mary as she washes and soaps herself
There is still a small worry in her eyes, but generally she looks somewhat relieved
Now we see the bathroom door being pushed slowly open
The noise of the shower drowns out any sound
The door is then slowly and carefully closed
And we see the shadow of a woman fall across the shower curtain
Mary's back is turned to the curtain
The white brightness of the bathroom is almost blinding
Suddenly we see the hand reach up, grasp the shower curtain, rip it aside
: - As she turns in response to the feel and  of the shower curtain being torn aside
look of pure horror erupts in her face
low terrible groan begins to rise up out of her throat
hand comes into the shot
The hand holds an enormous bread knife
The flint of the blade shatters the screen to an almost total, silver blankness
An impression of a knife slashing, as if tearing at the very screen, ripping the film
Over it the brief gulps of screaming
And then silence
And then the dreadful thump as Mary's body falls in the tub
The blank whiteness, the blur of the shower water, the hand pulling the shower curtain back
We catch one flicker of a glimpse of the murderer
woman, her face contorted with madness, her head wild with hair, as if she were wearing a fright-wig
And then we see only the curtain, closed across the tub, and hear the rush of the shower water
Above the shower-bar we see the bathroom door open again and after a moment we  the  of the front door slamming
: Lying half in, half out of the tub, the head tumbled over, touching the floor, the hair wet, one eye wide open as if popped, one arm lying limp and wet along the tile floor
Coming down the side of the tub, running thick and dark along the porcelain, we see many small threads of blood away from the body, travels slowly across the bathroom, past the toilet, out into the bedroom
As approaches the bed, we see the folded newspaper as Mary placed it on the bedside table
- beside the bed
The  now moves away over to the window and looks up to the house, and as it gets there we , coming from within the house, the  of Norman's fearful, shocked voice
' Mother
Oh God, what
blood, blood
mother
We cannot entirely distinguish these exclamations
After a moment or two of silence, Norman emerges from the front door, dashes down the path toward the motel
: - () Norman is coming  , running head-on
He dashes into an extreme close up and we see the terror and fear ripe in his face
as Norman races past, holds as Norman runs to the porch and quickly along it and directly to Mary's room
'  - () Norman pauses a moment in the doorway, glances about the room, hears the shower going, sees the bathroom door is open
He goes to the bathroom, looks in, sees the body
Slowly, almost carefully, he raises his hands to his face, covers his eyes, turns his face away
Then he crosses to the window, looks out at the house
Shot is so angled that we see the bedside table with the newspaper on it
After a moment, Norman moves from the window, sinks onto the edge of the bed
- Norman sitting on bed, the bathroom in b
g
of shot
We can see only the hand of the dead girl, lying along the tile floor
Norman presses his eyes, fights to find a way out of his dilemma
Slowly, a kind of settling comes upon him, the peace that comes with decision
Norman rises, goes to the window, looks out, and then, with resolution, closes the window and draws the curtain across it
Then he crosses to the front window, facing the porch, and draws those curtains closed
Then he switches off the bedroom light, leaving the room lit only by the spill from the bathroom
He opens the front door, goes out
- () Norman comes out of Mary's cabin, closes the door carefully behind him, goes along the porch to his office, goes in
We stay outside
Immediately, the "Vacancy" sign goes off, and then the motel sign goes off
As   closer to the office, the lights within go off and we  a closet door opening and then the  of a pail being picked up
Norman comes out of office, closes door, looks cautiously about, goes along porch, carrying pail with mop in it, goes into Mary's cabin, closing the door after him
' With the paper in the foreground, Norman enters
We can see him in the dim spill of light
He pauses by the door, then gathers his strength and goes into the bathroom
We  him set the pail on the tiled floor, and then we  the shower being turned off
And there is total silence so that we can see into bathroom
is  that we see Norman only from the waist up
Quickly and deftly he unhooks the shower curtain, emerges with it into the bedroom
down and we see him spread the shower curtain on the bedroom floor, just outside the bathroom door
He spreads the curtain so that one end of it comes up against the bathroom threshold and slightly over and onto the tile floor
Again he goes into the bathroom and up so that we see only the upper half of Norman
He works carefully, with his arms extended away from his body, slowly pulls the dead body out of the tub, drags it across the tile floor and onto the spread-out shower curtain in the bedroom
Having arranged the body, he straightens up, examines his hands, sees bloodstains on them
He returns to the bathroom, goes to the hand-basin
We see his hands being washed, see the bloodstains being diluted and washed away by the gush of the faucet water
We see Norman shake his hands free of the water, then turn to the job of cleaning the bathroom
He places the pail in the tub, runs water into it, dips the mop in, swabs the tile floor
With a towel he wipes off the wall over the tub and the edges and sides of the tub and even the shower curtain rod
Then he takes a second towel and goes over the cleaned areas, carefully drying them
Finally he rinses and squeezes out the mop, empties the pail, cleans out the tub, and goes out into the bedroom
' Norman steps carefully around the unseen body, crosses to the desk, starts going through Mary's handbag, in search of her car keys
He suddenly notices them lying on the desk, where he'd thrown them after parking her car
He picks up the keys, crosses the room, goes out
We see Norman pauses at the door, check cautiously, then hurry across the porch and into Mary's car
He circle-turns the car, so that its trunk is backed up to the turns porch, directly opposite Mary's door, as close as it can go
Then he alights, goes to the trunk, opens it with the key and, leaving the trunk lid raised, goes back into the cabin
' From a raised angle, we see Norman bend down and begin to wrap the shower curtain around the body
We see the edges of the curtain as they are raised and laid down again
Then he picks up the wrapped body, crosses to the door, uses his foot to pull the door open, and, leaving the door open behind him, goes quickly across the porch and gently lays the body in the trunk
He closes the lid then, but does not lock it
He comes back into the cabin, closes the door completely, flicks on the light
Again the newspaper is in the foreground
For a moment he pauses, closes his eyes against the realization of what he is doing, then quickly pushes all thoughts away, continues with his work
With the room lighted, he now proceeds to gather up all Mary's articles and toss them into the suitcase
He checks all drawers and the closet, gets down and checks under bed and bureau, goes into the bathroom, checks that room again, comes back into the bedroom, looks about carefully, spots Mary's handbag, throws even that into the suitcase, is finally satisfied that all traces of the girl are gone from the room
Then he closes Mary's suitcase, picks it up
With his free hand he picks up the pail, in which are the mop and the used towels
He crosses to the door, switches off the light with his shoulder, pulls open the door, starts out
As Norman stands in the doorway, he is suddenly and blindingly lit by the bright headlights of a passing car
The flash of the lights and the  of the   are over in a flicker of a moment, but it takes a few seconds for Norman to regain his former tense composure
Then he goes to the car trunk, raises it with his foot, throws the suitcase and the pail into it, slams it shut
He pauses a moment, then realizes he has left the bathroom light on in Mary's cabin
He returns to cabin
As he enters, his eye is caught by the newspaper on the bedside table
He goes to it, takes the newspaper, and looks once again into the bathroom
His glance goes right over the toilet bowl
He turns out the lights, crosses the darkened cabin, goes out onto the porch
He reopens the trunk, tosses in the newspaper and closes it
He goes around and jumps into the car and starts away
We  on the trunk, follow it for a while, then : - () The car pulls away from a   on the trunk and as we see that we are now in a swamp area
It is quiet except for the irritating noises of night insects
Norman stops the car at the very edge of the swamp, turns off the lights, gets out, leaving door open
He looks at the swamp, seems doubtful of its ability to swallow up the car, realizes he has no choice
He leans into the car, releases the emergency brake, starts to push
The front of the car begins to roll into the swamp
Suddenly there is the , of a motor
Norman freezes, listens
The  grows louder and Norman realizes it is an airplane flying overhead
The car is rolling quickly now
Norman jumps away, slams the door shut, stands tense
The  of the plane overhead grows louder
Norman looks up
'  - We see no plane
The  of the motor is beginning to diminish
: We see the relief in his face
He looks at the car
More than two-thirds of it have already sunk into the swamp
The trunk alone seems to hold poised above the sand and slime, as if refusing to go the rest of the way
Norman begins to panic, he steps dangerously close, pushes with his foot
And slowly the car sinks, until finally it is gone and we hear only the gentle plop of the swamp's final gulp, and see only the small after-bubble, like a visual burp
Norman waits a moment, then begins stamping out the tire marks, so obvious in the wet ground around the swamp
He stamps and drags his feet over the markings as we: : standing on the porch of the motel, leaning against a post
He is staring out into the night, a look of guarded, casual innocence on his face, as if he were taking one last moment of peaceful night air before retiring
Then he glances down and  follows his gaze
hose is lying on the ground outside Mary's cabin, its stream of water obliterating the tire marks
After a moment, Norman's hand comes into shot, picks up hose, places it in a new position
As   , we see that the water from the hose has erased and rearranged the road markings so that it would be impossible to tell that a car had been parked here
After a short wait, Norman goes to the hose-faucet, turns it off, unscrews the hose
As he rolls the hose, he walks away from the spot, past the office, heading for the path that leads to the house
He goes up the path, pauses at the steps of the house, tosses the curled hose onto the lawn, goes up the steps and into the house
him in, as he pauses at the foot of the stairs
Norman goes up the stairs
On the landing he stops
The door to his mother's room is closed
Lying in a heap outside the door are a blood-stained dress and a pair of elderly-woman's shoes
From an , we look down on Norman as he bends to pick up the stained dress and shoes
He rolls the shoes into the dress, tucks the small, neat bundle under his arm, and starts down the stairs, heading for the basement
- () It stands silhouetted against the sky
There is a long wait
Then, slowly, a curl of smoke comes out of the chimney
: '     - () Sam is seated at his desk, writing a letter
Sequence begins with   , over Sam's shoulder, and we can read as mush as he has written of the letter
The letterhead reads "Sam Loomis - Hardware," and the letter reads: "Dearest right-as-always Mary: 'm sitting in this tiny back room which isn't big enough for both of us, and suddenly it looks big enough for both of us
So what if we're poor and cramped and miserable, at least we'll be happy
If you haven't come to your senses, and still want to
begins   as Sam turns the sheet of paper over, continues backing away out of the small back room and heads, backwards, down the corridor, we see a young clerk, , Sam's assistant, standing behind the counter, a look of handsome patience on his face
He is waiting on a meticulous, elderly woman customer, who is holding and examining a large can of insecticide
As  : They tell you what its ingredients are and how it's guaranteed to exterminate any insect in the world, but they do not tell you whether or not it's painless
And  say insect or man, death should always be painless
, by this has reached the front door of the hardware store and we now see a girl standing just inside the door
She is an attractive girl with a rather definite manner, a look of purposefulness
She carries a handbag and a small overnight case
She is Mary's sister,
Bob Summerfield has noticed Lila, smiles brightly at her, gives her an 'll-be-with-you-in-a-moment nod
Lila starts to walk toward the counter, never taking her eyes off Bob
As she approaches, she asks quietly: Sam
You want to see Sam
Sam Loomis
(yelling toward back room) Sam
Lady wants to see you
Lila looks to the back room
The woman customer goes on worriedly examining the fine print of the insecticide can
Sam comes to the door of his room, pauses, looks at Lila a moment, starts toward her, his expression indicating that he does not know her
Lila studies him with a quiet, worried expression
Yes
May  talk to you
(a bit mystified) Sure
Lila glances at the customer and the clerk, turns, starts toward the front of the store
Sam holds a moment, then follows
As he reaches her, she turns, her eyes studying him intently as she says: 'm Mary's sister
Lila
(quickly) Is Mary here
Sam is mystified, and is also aware of the worried, hostile expression on Lila's face
He studies her for a quiet moment
Behind them is a display of various size carving knives
Is something wrong
want to know if my sister is here
Here
With you
Where
don't know where
In your store, somewhere in your town
anywhere
What's the matter
Don't you know
As Sam is about to speak, the Woman Customer comes sailing past, speaking as she goes and wearing a satisfied smile
All  can do is hope if it isn't painless, it's quick
She speaks "quick" with a kind of delicious bite, nods happily, goes on out of the store
Sam is now staring apprehensively at Lila
What should  know
To begin with, where Mary is
Do you
No
take it you don't either
(As Lila shakes her head) How long
Last Friday
She left work, and home
was in Tucson over the weekend
haven't heard from her, not even a phone call
And you thought she'd come up here, to me
If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you
good reason,  suppose
(Slightly exasperated) Well what do you think, we eloped or something
Or we're living in sin and
Mr
Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all
Mary is missing
was getting to that
What do you know about it
Nothing
You're putting me on the defensive
Look, if you two are in this thing together,  don't care, it's none of my business
But  want to see Mary
want her to tell me she's all right and it's none of my business
Then 'll go back to Phoenix and
She stops, the anxiety and fear building up in her, her eyes beginning to fill with worried tears
Sam studies her for a moment, then turns and calls: Bob
Run out and get yourself some lunch
It's okay, Sam,  brought it with me
Run out and eat it
Bob gets the message, goes out through the back way
Sam goes closer to Lila, speaks with soft seriousness
What thing
Huh
What thing could we be in together
( pause) hate tears
(Takes out hankie) Is Mary
in trouble
Yes
Well why didn't she come to me
call me
Not that kind
(Almost a smile) You men and your egos
(Seriously) Never mind my ego
Let's talk about Mary
Their attention is distracted by a man who has strolled quietly into the room
He ignores them, walks past them, goes behind the counter, takes down a sign reading " ," walks back to the door, closes door, hangs the sign across the door window, locks the door, turns to Sam and Lila, folds his arms, smiles a particularly unfriendly smile
Let's all talk about Mary
Who are you, friend
Milt Arbogast, Private Investigator
(To Lila) Where is she, Miss Crane
don't know
Wouldn't have been able to tail you if you did
What's your interest
Money
There is a moment's silence and then, unable to tolerate the sudden frightening happenings, Sam explodes
Somebody better tell me what's going on and tell me fast
can take so much and then
(Interrupting calmly) Your girl friend stole forty thousand dollars
Sam looks at Arbogast in utter shock and in that state asks one of those seemingly ridiculous questions
Why
(An almost amused smile) Must've needed it
What are you talking about
(To Lila) What is this
She was supposed to bank it, on Friday, for her boss
She didn't
And no one has seen her since
(Looking at Sam) Someone has seen her
Someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars
(To Sam) She is your girl friend, isn't she
Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back
It was all in cash
(Correcting with Cassidy's word) Casharoonie
Sam, if she's here
She isn't
real look of anguish comes into Lila's face
And Arbogast studies it, then speaks
You came up here on a hunch, Miss Crane
Nothing more
No phone call
from him, or from your sister herself
(wearily) Not even a hunch
Just hope
With a little checking,  could get to believe you
(anxiously) don't care if you do or
want to see Mary
before she gets in any deeper
Did you check in Phoenix
hospitals
maybe she had an accident
a hold-up
She was seen leaving town in her car
Seen by her very victims, might add
(after a moment) don't believe it
(to Lila, slowly) Do you
(a thoughtful pause) Yes
just
did
The moment they told me
You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister
Lila turns from Sam, a flush of guilt and regret in her face
Arbogast looks at her, quiet sympathetically
We're always quickest to doubt people who have a record for being honest
think she's here, Miss Crane
Where there's a boyfriend
(Trails off, smiles encouragingly) She won't be back there among the nuts and bolts
but she'll be in this town
somewhere
'll find her
He nods, takes down the closed-for-lunch sign, sails it to the counter, opens door, goes out into the street
After a quiet moment: just listened
and believed everything they told me
'She stole the money
' 'We don't want to get her in trouble
' 'No don't bring the police in'
It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police
No
The man whose money she
he talked so loud and fast, and should've called the police
He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it
All that cash
ought to call the police right now
No
Why not
Sam, is she hiding here
Are you two planning to go away with the money
How could  go away
'm in debt up to my
(Smiles at the incongruity of his reply, then goes serious) If she did steal that money
It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would
Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me
us
She haven't even called you
didn't see her
and  didn't hear from her
Believe that
need to
need to believe something
This is the first time 've ever come up against anything couldn't
understand
You've led a charmed life
No
just think
anything can be explained
But Mary, doing a thing like this
don't know how to handle
Maybe we can handle it together
(He smiles encouragingly) ( rueful shrug) came flying up here expecting to get some explanation
for all know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home
'd better go home
( thoughtful pause) think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody
Why don't you stay here
When she shows up
or calls
be here
( long study, her suspicion of him evaporating) You want me to stay here
She'll need both of us
(considers, then:) Where
can  stay
(brightly) First rate hotel, fifty yards up the street
Come on
(as he reaches for the closed-for-lunch sign) After we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich
Then we'll come back here
and wait
He hangs the sign on the door, ushers Lila out, closes door behind him
: - () They emerge from the store and walk along to the hotel
As they enter, Arbogast is in the act of taking over a white Ford sedan from a rental car man
They glance at him and he returns a cynical look
: - () Outside another hotel we see Arbogast alight from the white car and go into new hotel
: - () The white car speeding along the highway
: - () Arbogast going into the office - we see the sign above him
: '  - () high shot showing the freeway and Bates house and motel on the side old highway
pause and then across the bottom of the picture a white car speeds by on the freeway
: - () Another Hotel
Arbogast goes in
: '  - () The white car speeding along the freeway again going in the opposite direction to last time
Norman, a tiny figure, is seen going up the steps to his mother's house
: - () Arbogast's search is getting down in the scale
This is an entrance to a cheesy boarding house
"Rooms to Rent," etc
He looks at his list and then goes in
: '  - () The white car goes by on the freeway again
: - () Arbogast goes in
: '  - () Heavy traffic on the freeway
beat or two - again the white car
It slows up opposite the distant motel
It makes a turn and goes back out of scene
pause and it reappears on the old road and slowly makes its way toward the Bates' Motel
'    - () We now see Norman
He has brought out an old rocking chair and has placed it on the office porch and is sitting hunched in it
And he is darning one of his own socks
Beyond the porch, and Norman, we see the old house and can barely make out, in the twilight dimness, the figure of his mother seated at the window
Here, too, there is that quality of quiet peace surrounded by a vague foreboding
Now Norman looks up at the  of the approaching car
And continues looking as the car comes to a stop and Arbogast gets out
Arbogast gives the place a quick once-over, gazes at Norman, starts forward
In his steps and manner there is that bored, routine-logged quality of a man who has seen too many motels and asked question of too many hotel managers over too short a period of time
Norman rises as Arbogast comes forward
(shoving sock in his pocket) always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy
(Cheerfully) Twelve in fact
Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies
(pleasantly) In the past two days 've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon
This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large
don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem
any use
(Points) This used to be the main highway
(Starts for office) Want to register, please
Sit down
don't want to trouble you, just want to ask
No trouble
Today's linen day change all the beds once a week, whether they've been used or not
dampness
hate the smell of dampness
(Opening office door) It's such a dank smell
Norman is holding the door open, so Arbogast walks in
Norman follows
- () Norman switches on the overhead light, starts for the linen closet, suddenly pauses, turns, studies Arbogast, who has remained standing by the door
You out to buy a motel
No
Oh
thought
you said you'd been to so many in two days
What was it you wanted to ask
'm looking for a missing person
(takes out and opens wallet and extends it as he speaks) My name's Arbogast, private investigator
(takes back wallet when Norman doesn't look at it) Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week
From Phoenix
( look at Norman's frightened expression) It's a private matter
family wants to forgive her
(smiles) She isn't in trouble
(forcing a smile) didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble
'm not the police
Oh
He waits a moment, then opens closet, starts counting out sheets and pillow cases, keeps his back to Arbogast
Arbogast takes a photograph out of his pocket, talks as he crosses to Norman
We have reason to believe she came this way
might have stopped in this area
(extends photograph, which Norman doesn't glance at) Did she stop here
No
No one has stopped here in weeks
Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself
Committing myself to what
You sure talk like a Policeman
Look at the picture
Please
Norman glances, briefly, turns away, lifts sheets and pillow cases off the shelf holds them close, almost protectively
No
At least  don't recall
She might have used an alias
Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered
(interrupting) don't even bother with guests registering any more
mean, little by little, you drop the formalities
(more relaxed, because Arbogast is listening with a pleasant smile) shouldn't even bother to change the linen
guess habits die hard
Which reminds me
He goes to the wall, flips a light switch
The vacancy sign
Just in case
We had a couple the other night, said if the sign hasn't been on they'd have thought this was an old deserted mining town or something
Now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them
What
You thought no one has stopped here in weeks
Now, try to remember if this girl
( pause, a study) Maybe she even signed the register
because habits die hard
Let's check it, huh
Norman says nothing
Arbogast goes to the desk, pulls the registry book around, flips back a page or two
Norman simply stares at the man
Arbogast hums faintly, pleasantly, as he examines the pages
Then: Yes sir
Marie Samuels
Interesting alias
He takes a slip of paper out of his pocket, lays it beside the signature in the registry book, all the while nodding and smiling nicely, as if this discovery will make Norman as happy as it is making him
Don't know where she got "Marie," but "Samuels" figures
Her boy friend's name is Sam
(Turns to Norman, the smile gone) Was she in disguise
Or do you want to check the picture again
didn't lie to you
just have trouble keeping track of
time
Arbogast has reached him, the picture extended
Norman looks dutifully at it
It was raining and her hair didn't look like that
damped out,  guess
Tell me all about her
She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early
How early
Very early
Dawn
Of which morning
The following morning
Sunday
No one met her
No
Or arrived with her
No
She didn't call anyone
Even locally
No
You didn't spend the whole night with her did you
No
Of all
How do you know she didn't make a call
She was tired
She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning
Yes, now 'm remembering very clearly because 'm picturing
When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail
She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way
Back where
What do you mean
You said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather
Oh
My private parlor
She had an awful hunger
so  made her some supper
And then she went to bed and left in the morning
didn't even see her leave
How did she pay you
What
Cash or check
For the cabin
Cash
And when she left, she never came back
Why should she
'm sorry,  have work to do, Mr
if you don't mind
do mind
If it don't jell, it ain't aspic
(smiles) This ain't jelling
don't know what you expect me to know about
people come and go
She isn't still here, is she
Not at all
Suppose  wanted to search the cabins, all twelve
would  need a warrant
(as if pleasantly exasperated) Look, if you won't believe me, go ahead
You can help me make beds if you like
(laughs, shakes his head) Come on
He starts out
Arbogast pauses, momentarily confused by the young man's openness
: - () Norman walks down the porch, hesitates before Cabin One, walks on a bit toward Cabin Two, stops, turns to see if Arbogast is following
Arbogast has come out onto the porch, but is not following
He has walked to the opposite end of the porch and is standing at its edge, looking up at the old house
The upstairs window is in darkness
The neon of the Vacancy and Motel signs splash strange light over the scene
Change your mind
Arbogast does not reply
Norman becomes apprehensive, starts to Arbogast, forcing himself to remain calm and cheerful
guess 've got one of those faces you can't help believing
(to Norman, but continuing to stare at the house) Anyone at home
live there
Alone
Someone is sitting in that window
My mother
Arbogast turns, gazes seriously at him
She's
ill
Confined to her room
It's practically living alone
(after a pause) If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you
Of course not
If she paid you well
Now, look
Or if she had you say
gallantly protecting her
you wouldn't be fooled
you'd know she was just using you
Wouldn't you
'm not a fool
And 'm not capable of being fooled
Not even by women
didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood
'm sorry
(disturbed now) That's all right
maybe she could have fooled me
But
(a rueful smile) She didn't fool my mother
Your mother met her
(quickly) Can  talk to your mother
No
told you, she's confined
Just for a moment
She might have picked up a hint you'd miss
Sick old women are sharp
Come on, won't disturb
No
Just no
have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and 'm near it
There's just so much pushing  can take and  think
All right
(starts away, toward his car, pauses) Might save me a lot of leg-work if could just talk to your mother
But 'd need a warrant for that, won't Norman does not respond
Arbogast gets in his car, starts the motor
Norman looks up, studies the man's face, his own face showing apprehension
Arbogast backs the car around very slowly, his gaze divided between the old house and the lighted window of Cabin Two
As he turns the car out, his headlights light up the porch
Norman stands, watching him drive away
- () The car pulls up and Arbogast gets out of car, leaving motor running
As he starts to walk across the highway, and we : - () Arbogast gets to the phone booth, enters , and we see Arbogast remove a small notebook from his pocket, check on a number, drop a dime in the slot and dial this number
As we reach phone booth, : (into phone) Miss Crane, please
(listens) She leave a number
(listens) Thanks
(hangs up, dials again, waits) Lila there, Mr
Loomis
Arbogast
(waits) Lila
Look, this isn't much, but it might make you feel a little better
Mary was up here
Spent last Saturday night at Bates'  Motel, out here on the old highway
(listens) Young fellow runs it, said Mary spent the night, left, period
(listens) did question him, believe me think  got all there was to get
Just have to try to pick up the scent from here
(listens) Well
maybe that's because  don't feel entirely satisfied
He's got a sick old mother, confined type, and think she saw Mary and talked to her
Shame, too
confined old women love to talk to strangers
(listens) was, but  think 'll go back to the motel, first
(listens) No, you stay put, Lila
With Loomis
should be back in an hour
(listens) All right
And Lila
You'll be happy to know what  think
think our friend Sam Loomis didn't even know Mary was here
(smiles) See you in an hour
Or less
He hangs up, gets out of the phone booth
: '  - () distant view of the House and Motel
There is a light on in the house
There is also a light on in Norman's office
We see Norman emerge from his office and move along the porch toward the distant cabins
He carries sheets on his arm
He goes into the last cabin and switches the light on
Into the foreground the hood of the white Ford enters the scene and stops
Arbogast gets out
He goes over to the Motel office
- () Arbogast goes in
- () Arbogast looks around the empty office and calls
Bates
He goes over to the door to the parlor and enters
He looks around the bird-ridden room
He stops short as he sees: - - goes over to it
He finds it unlocked
With a quick, cautious look around he opens it
- - straightens up and goes out
- () Arbogast comes out and looks off
He sees: The door ajar
-  - () would go along but he stops with a new thought
He turns around and looks off
-       - () - comes to a decision
He goes off
dashes up the stone steps to the House
as Arbogast goes up onto the porch
The house is dark within except, as we can now see, for a faint spill of light in the foyer, light which comes from the upstairs hall
Arbogast goes to the living room window, looks in, sees only darkness
Then he goes to the door, listens for along moment, hears nothing
Very slowly, almost painfully, he turns the knob of the door and pushes gently with his arm and shoulder
The door begins to open
He allows it to open just enough for him to slip through and into the foyer
: '  - () Arbogast gradually eases the door closed, stands against it, waiting
He looks up in the direction of the light, sees no one
The door at the head of the stairs is closed
Arbogast listens, holds his breath, hears what could be human sounds coming from upstairs but realizes these could also be the sounds of an old house after sunset
After a careful wait, he crosses to the stairs, starts up, slowly, guardedly, placing a foot squarely on each step to test it for squeaks or groans before placing his full weight on it , remaining on floor level but   the stairway as Arbogast makes his way up
: We see Arbogast coming up the stairs
And now we see, too, the door of the mother's room, opening, carefully and slowly
As Arbogast reaches the landing, the door opens and the mother steps out, her hand raises high, the blade of an enormous knife flashing
- The knife slashes across his cheek and neck
Blood spurts
The sudden attack throws him off balance
He stumbles back and staggers down the whole of the staircase
He frantically gropes for the balustrade as he goes backwards down the stairs
The   him all the way
wicked knife keeps thrusting itself into the foreground
As he collapses at the bottom, the black head and shoulders of Mrs
Bates plunges into the foreground as the    to contain the raising and descending murder weapon
- () Lila is sitting close by the phone, and looks as if she hasn't moved from it in the last hour
Sam is pacing, occasionally stopping at the window, glancing out, pacing again
The ash tray close to Lila is filled
There is a thick atmosphere of smoke, tension and weariness in the small, otherwise cozy room
(at window, quietly) Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound
Ever notice, Lila
(unable to keep up small talk) Sam
He said an hour
Or less
It's been three
Are we just going to go on sitting here
(suddenly cheerful) He'll be back
Let's sit still and hang on, okay
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam
Hundreds
Which one is your pet
Whenever  start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and
feel better
feel better when you feel better
(a pause - then she rises) Where's the old highway
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours
Yes
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do
Patience doesn't run in our family
Sam, 'm going out there
Arbogast said
An hour
Or less
Sam stares at her, frowns in concern over her very real anxiety, goes to the phone, dials operator
(into phone) Got the number of the motel out on the old highway
Bates,  think
(waits) Sam
Why call when we can go
And maybe pass Arbogast on the road
(into phone) Thanks
He presses down the receiver, releases it, dials Bates' Motel
The faint other-end ringing tones can be heard, repeatedly, annoyingly
He waits
(to Lila) Probably on his way back right now
Sam, 'm going
(hangs up and picks up his jacket) You'll never find it
He starts for the door
Lila follows after him into the store
He pauses halfway down, turns, puts his hands on her arms
Stay here
Why can't  go out there with you
(looks at her) don't know
(he collects himself) One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way
(nervously) Just wait here
(a warm smile) Contemplate your
panic button
He hurries down to the street door and out
on Lila as she stares after Sam
As she stands alone in the darkened store, all the hardware seems to take on sinister shapes
Among some bathroom fittings a nozzle from a shower falls onto the floor
Lila turns and picks if from the floor and puts it back in its place
She turns and again looks to the deserted street with a touch of anxiety
She gives a slight unconscious shiver
: - () Tall and lonely still against the moonlight, the figure of Norman, silhouetted
He doesn't move, merely stands there at the edge of the swamp, staring down at the now calm and quiet face of it
: - () All light are out, except the light in Norman's mother's room
And her figure can be seen sitting in the window, relaxed in a high-back chair, her face turned into the room
After a second, we hear the    , and then Sam's small pick-up truck swings into the driveway
Sam stops the motor, automatically switches off headlights, pauses as he observes the silence and darkness of the area
Then he hops out of the cab, goes quickly to the office, knocks on the door
As he waits for a response, he looks down the long porch, studies the darkened cabins, knocks again, louder, looks in the other direction and sees the house and the figure at the one lit window
He stares a moment then calls loudly: Arbogast
: The silhouette of Norman
He is still
Over shot, very dimly, comes the   ' , calling again for Arbogast
Norman turns slowly until, in silhouette, we see his profile, his chin lowered furtively as he looks over his shoulder in the direction of the house
There is silence for a moment, and then again the  of Sam  at the door
: - () The store is in darkness, only the glow from the back room spilling in
With  placed with its back to the street door, we can see the distant tiny figure of Lila seated and waiting in the back room beyond
There is a  of a car pulling up
The tiny figure jumps up and runs all the way from the back room down the aisle of hardware and comes into a
We see Lila's desperate anxious look
From her viewpoint we see Sam alighting from his truck and coming toward the door of the store
He enters
He and Lila exchange quiet glances
He didn't come back here
(worriedly) Sam
No Arbogast
No Bates
And only the old lady at home
(frowning) sick old lady unable to answer the door
or unwilling
Where could he have gone
Maybe he got some definite lead
Maybe he went right on
Without calling me
In a hurry
Sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling
Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything
(interrupting) Yes
think he would have
Lila goes quiet
Sam starts toward the back room, pauses at the doorway, turns
Lila has remained by the door, looking out at the street
She feels his pause, turns, and for a moment they share at each other across the darkened room
Let's go see Al Chambers
Who's he
He's the Deputy Sheriff around here
As he starts forward
: - () dark, quiet, tree-ceilinged street, the small neat houses dim in the moonlight
Sam's pick-up truck comes down the street, pulls up before the house of Sheriff Chambers on Sam and Lila as they remain for a moment in the truck's cab, staring quietly at the sleeping house
Our Deputy sleeps
Well
Nothing
Just
all the lights out
must be asleep
(a small exasperation) Does that mean we can't
No
'm just procrastinating
People hate when the doorbell rings in the middle of the night
(gives up, starts out) Come on
He gets out of cab, goes around to help Lila
She is already out
them up the small path to the front door
Sam presses the bell button
Both he and Lila are almost knocked over by the shocking, clanging, ear-splitting within the house, a ring which sounds more like a fire alarm than a doorbell
He tries to smile, fails
Lila doesn't even try
The downstairs hall light goes on and a moment later the door is unhesitatingly opened by
, a small, lively stick of a woman wrapped in a thick flannel robe and a corona of hospitality
Oh
Sorry, Mrs
Chambers
hate bothering you
You didn't
(a cross look up at the bell) It's tinkerbell
(a quick smile at Lila) Al wants to be sure he'll hear it if anyone rings it in the middle of the night
(to Sam) Well come on in, at least
As she opens the door wide, : '  - () Fat roses splatter the wallpaper
The stairs are carpeted
The lighting is bright
There is a perfectly fitting wall phone by the parlor arch
Mrs
Chambers goes to the stairway, yells up
Albert
(a tiny wait, a smile as Sam and Lila enter) Al Chambers
Sam is about to close the door behind him
Mrs
Chambers motions for him not to, scurries across the hall, leans outside, presses the doorbell
The  within the house is even more shattering
She closes the door, starts to the stairway, pauses as the  of movement above Customers
comes down the stairs, in a bathrobe which matches his wife's
He is a tall, narrow man with a face originally destined for Mount Rushmore
He nods at Sam, looks at him with wide-awake eyes and a no-nonsense concern
We have a problem
(to Lila) Let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking
No, thank you
It's my problem, too
don't know where to start
(a look at Lila) Except at the beginning
Yes
(to Sheriff) This is Lila Crane, from Phoenix
She's been here for a few days, looking for her sister
There's a private detective helping
and, well, we got a call tonight, from this detective, saying he'd traced Mary
Mary is Lila's sister
Yes
He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway
(to the Sheriff) Bates' Motel
(to Lila) He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it
Go on, Sam
He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs
Bates
(a pleasant shock) Norman took a wife
No
An old woman, his mother
(to Sheriff, quickly) That was early this evening
And we haven't seen or heard from him since
went out to the motel, just got back
No one was in the office, and
(interrupting, anxiously) Will you help us
think something's wrong out there
(after a considerate pause) Now
Your sister is missing how long
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday
And no trace until
How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale
They thought she'd be coming to me
Left Phoenix under her own steam
Yes
(a pause) She ain't missing so much as she's run away
Yes
From what
(a look at sam, then:) She stole some money
lot
Forty thousand dollars
And the police haven't been able to
(interrupting) Everyone concerned thought
if they could get her to give back the money
they could avoid involving her with the police
Explains the private detective
He traced her to the Bates place
What'd he exactly say when he called you
Mary had been there, one night, and had left
With the forty thousand dollars
He didn't mention the money
(anxiously) What he said on the phone isn't important, is it
He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't
That's what want you to do something about
Like what
Go out there
Find somebody, ask some questions
(a pause) 'm sorry if  seem over-anxious to you
keep thinking
something's wrong
have to know what
think something's wrong, too, Miss
But not the same thing
think your private detective is what's wrong
(As Lila is about to object) think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going
probably from Norman Bates
and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money
He said he was dissatisfied
and was going back
(to Sheriff) Why don't you call Norman and let him say just what happened, if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off
it'll make the girl feel better, Albert
At this hour
He was out when  was there
If he's back he probably isn't even in bed yet
He wasn't out when you were there
He just wasn't answering the door in the dead of night
like some people do
This fellow lives like a hermit
Recluse
Kinder word
(to Sam) You must remember that bad business out there
About ten years ago
've only been here five
Right now it feels like ten, but
All right
Then call
At least, call
Mrs
Chambers goes to phone, dials operator
(into phone) Florrie, the Sheriff wants you to connect him with the Bates Motel
She hands the receiver to the Sheriff
He takes it, reluctantly, listens to the dim sound of  on the other end
After a moment: (into phone) Norman
Sheriff Chambers
(listens) Been just fine, thanks
Listen, we got some worries here
Did you have a man stop out there tonight
(listens) Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway
private detective, name of
Arbogast
(into phone) Arbogast
(listens) And after he left
(listens) No, it's okay, Norman
How's it been going out there
(listens) Well,  think you oughta unload that place and open up closer in to the action, a smaller place, you know
but
Please
(into phone) Sorry  got you up, boy
Go back to sleep
Yeah, be glad to
(hangs up, turns to Mrs
Chambers) Said to give you his regards
(faint irony) Was that all
This detective was out there and Norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away
And he didn't go back
Didn't see the mother
The Sheriff looks long at Lila, shakes his head sympathetically
You should've called in the police the second you found your sister has skipped
You go starting private investigations, using people you don't even know
What difference does that
Your Detective told you a nakedfaced lie
Barefaced
He told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question Norman Bates' mother, right
Yes
(a pause, then calmly) Norman Bates' mother has been dead and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for the last ten years
There is a long silence
Sam and Lila stare at the Sheriff
helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in
Periwinkle blue
It ain't only local history, Sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers
Mrs
Bates poisoned this guy she was
involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself
Strychnine
Ugly way to die
Norman found them dead together
In bed
You mean that old woman  saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother
(hopefully, happily) Maybe you saw Mary
'd know the difference between Mary and an old woman
Now wait a minute, Sam
You sure you saw an old woman
Yes
In the house behind the motel
pounded and called but she
just ignored me
And you want to tell me you saw Norman Bates' mother
It must've been
Arbogast said so, too
and he said the young man wouldn't let him see her because she was ill
The Sheriff stares at both of them, and when he finally speaks there is an almost inaudible tone or irony in his voice
Well, if the woman up there is Mrs
Bates
who's that woman buried out at Greenlawn Cemetery
: '    - () Norman sits in the dim, one-lamp light, the phone next to him, his hand still near it as if he had not been able to move his hand after hanging up
He is staring at the shrike- like bird which is perched on the lamp shade
Decision and resolution are beginning to show in his face
Suddenly he rises, starts quickly out of the room, tries to switch off the lamp as he goes and in so doing succeeds only in knocking the bird off the shade
He watches it fall, does not try to catch it
It hits the floor with a thud and sawdust spills out
He stares sadly at it, for a moment, then tends down, scoops up the sawdust, tries to press it into the split seam, picks up the bird, puts it in a drawer
Then he puts out the lamp, goes out, crosses the darkened office and goes outside
: - () Norman comes off the porch, walks to the path and directly up to the house, opens the door and goes in
: - () Norman goes up, pauses one moment outside his mother's door, then opens it and goes in, leaving the door open
For a moment we hear only Norman's low, quiet voice, his words indistinguishable
Then we hear the cold shot of his mother's derisive laughter
' am sorry, boy, but you do manage to look ludicrous when you give me orders
' Please, mother
' (Sharp, laughter all gone) No
will not hide in the fruit cellar
( shrill laugh) Think 'm fruity, huh
(Hard, cold again) 'm staying right here
This is my room and no one will drag me out of it
least of all my big bold son
' (Rising now, anxiously) They'll come now, Mother
He came after the girl and now someone will come after him
How long do you think you can go on
Mother, please, just for a few days, just so they won't find you
' (Mimicking) Just for a few days
(Furious) In that dank fruit cellar
No
You hid me there once, boy, and you won't do it again
Not ever again
Now get out
( pause, quiet) told you to get out, boy
( longer pause) Norman
What do you think you're going to do
Don't you touch me
Don't
Norman
( pause, then cajolingly) All right, son, put me down and 'll go
'll go on my own two feet can go on my own two feet, can't
During all this the  has been slowly creeping up the stairs
It does not stop at the top however, but continues on the same high angle that we had in Scene 57
She starts to laugh, a terrible sound like an obscene melody
' 'll carry you, mother
Norman comes out of the room, his mother held in his arms, her head leaning against his shoulder
He carries her down the stairs, along the lower landing to the cellar stairs, and then down those stairs to the basement
: - () An overcast morning, but a sunny-faced crowd
The service is just over, there is contentment, and peace, and just a little -went-to-church-smugness in the faces of the churchgoers as they come out of the chapel, and spread their separate ways away
Amongst the crowd, waiting and searching the faces, are Sam and Lila
In their expressions there is no peace, no contentment
They are not speaking
Lila looks as if she has had no sleep
Suddenly, Sam becomes alert, takes Lila's arm, starts toward the church
, stops as they approach Sheriff and Mrs
Chambers
The Sheriff stares rather sympathetically at Lila
Mrs
Chambers smiles nicely
We thought, if you didn't mind, we'd go out to the motel with you
He's already been
Went out before service
Have you two had breakfast
(To Sheriff, not a question) You didn't find anything
Nothing
Here, let's clear the path
He moves away and the others follow
them to the curb
(Interrupting) Did he say anything about my sister
Just what he told your detective
She used a fake name, saw the register myself
Saw the whole place, as a matter of fact
That boy is alone there
No mother
You must've seen an illusion, Sam
Now,  know you're not the seeing- illusion type
But no woman was illusion there and  don't believe in ghosts, so there it is
still feel
Can see you do
Sorry  couldn't make you feel better
You want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person
And the theft, is what you want to do
Sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law, that's the sooner you'll stand a chance of your sister bein' picked up
How about that
don't know
It's Sunday
Come over and do the reporting at the house, 'round dinner time
Make it nicer
You too, Sam
She smiles brightly, as if having invited them over to discuss this year's charity fandango, takes the Sheriff's arm, starts away
The Sheriff nods as he goes
Sam and Lila are alone now, at the curb, before the deserted chapel
For a long moment they just stand there, their faces as gray and overcast as the sky
Maybe  am the seeing-illusions type
You're not
Sam takes her arm, starts walking her up the street toward the spot where his pick-up truck is parked
them
Want me to drop you at the hotel
Or you want to come over to the store
Lila does not answer
They reach the truck
Lila looks directly at Sam as he helps her into the cab
won't feel satisfied unless  got out there, Sam
Neither will
He slams the door, hurries around truck, gets into driver's seat, starts motor
As the truck drives off, : - ( - ) For a moment, both are silent; Sam watching the road as if there were other cars on it, Lila staring at nothing in particular, except perhaps her own inner fear
wonder if we'll ever see Mary again
Of course we will
Alive
Sam looks as if he'd like to say something humorous, something to cheer her
He cannot
He remains silent
We lived together all our lives
When we woke up one morning and found ourselves orphans, Mary quit college and got a job, so  could go to college
Where'd you go to college
didn't
got a job, too
( pause) wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me
Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them
(Almost to himself) She was willing to lick the stamps
Lila looks quizzically at him, is too concerned to pursue it
wonder so many things about her now
Why she never told me about you
Funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers
We were going to get married
Are going to get married
Do you know how  found out about you
found one of your letters
it was a nice letter, Sam
This is the old highway
suppose
when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper
she always tried to be proper
Watch your tenses
Huh
She always tries to be proper
Sam slows the truck to a stop, sighs, starts to light up a cigarette
Lila looks questioningly and impatiently at him
You going to wait here for me
'm going with you
But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in
We're going to register
As man and wife
And get shown to a cabin
and then search every inch of that place, inside and
outside
You won't believe it
(Starts motor) But this will be the first time 've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers
( tiny smile, first in hours) believe it
As truck starts to drive on, : - () The place is empty and silent and washed dirty by the deep gray of the cloudy sky
We see Sam's truck turning into the driveway and pulling to a stop
After a moment, Sam and Lila get out of the truck
Close on Sam and Lila as they meet on the porch side of the truck
The motel office and the house beyond can be seen in b
g
of shot
Sam and Lila merely stare for a moment, then turn and gaze up at the house
There is no figure in the window and the shade is drawn
Same goes to the office door, peers in, knocks, opens door, enters
Lila remains on the driveway, beside the truck
: '  - () on Norman standing by the window
He has pulled the curtains very slightly apart, is staring out and down at the motel, his eyes studying the lone figure of Lila, who is standing by the truck and looking up at the house
Norman studies her, and as her eyes look up at this very window he closes the curtains, turns away
We see the suspicion and fear in his face, the surge of panic and his struggle to contain it
Then he goes away remains on window, shooting out and down, and through the frail curtains we can see Sam as he comes out of the motel office and joins Lila
- (Unconsciously whispering) wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting
Someone was at that window
saw the curtain move
Sam takes Lila's arm
Come on
He starts with her toward the path which leads to the old house
with them, and as they turn around the office corner, they see Norman coming down the path toward them
They pause and Norman pauses
He does not smile, nor speak
His usual grin and soft friendliness are gone; containment and impassivity lie in their place
(Cheerfully) Just coming up to ring for you
(Coming forward) suppose you want a cabin
We'd hoped to make it straight to San Francisco, but we don't like the look of that sky
Looks like a bad day coming
doesn't it
Norman walks past Sam, giving him the sort of quick, disapproving glance one gives a man who is obviously lying, goes onto the porch and into the office
Sam and Lila follow Norman
- () Norman crosses to the desk, goes behind it, takes the key to cabin number twelve off the keyboard
Sam and Lila have entered and are almost to the desk-counter by this time
'll take you to
Better sign in first, hasn't we
Sam eyes scan the counter, looking for a registration book
It isn't necessary
(Interrupting with a friendly cheerfulness) Uh, uh
My boss is paying for this trip
ninety percent business
and he wants practically notarized receipts
better sign in and get a receipt
Norman stares at Sam, as if he'd like to yell at him, call him "liar
" Instead he reaches under the desk counter, brings out the registration book
Lila moves closer, studies the book as Sam signs in
Sam signs "Joe and Mrs
Johnson
"  The signature and city of "Marie Samuels" and after it, the notation "Cabin One," can be clearly seen three registrations above Sam's
When Sam has finished he closes book, hands it back to Norman
Norman does not take it, starts out from behind counter
'll get your bags
Haven't any
(after a stare) 'll show you the cabin
As he starts for the door, Sam laughs
Norman stops, turns, looks at him
First time 've seen it happen
(to Lila) Check in any place in this country without bags, and you have to pay in advance
Sam smiles as if at a funny remark, takes a bill out of his pocket
Ten dollars
Norman returns to Sam, takes the extended bill, is about to start out again
That receipt
Norman goes reluctantly behind counter, lays down the key to cabin twelve, takes a receipt book out of the drawer under counter, starts to write
Lila steps up to the desk, picks up the key, quickly, starts out
'll start ahead
Norman looks up, gazes her as she goes out door
- () Lila comes along the porch, pauses before cabin one, tries the door
It opens
She closes it quickly as she hears Sam and Norman coming out of the motel office, continues on down the porch
(To Norman, who is following) Don't bother yourself
we'll find it
He goes on down the porch, doesn't even glance at cabin one, walks quickly and catches up to Lila just as she reaches cabin twelve
with Norman, who is standing by the office door, looking after Sam and Lila, his face alert and no longer impassive
He waits a moment, after they have closed their cabin door, then crosses to the pickup truck
with him
He studies the truck, then leans in through the driver's window, twists the registration card around, reads it
It gives the correct name and address of Sam Loomis
Norman comes back out of the window, glances once more toward cabin twelve, then at the old house
His suspicions are confirmed, and now there is the relaxation of relief in his face
He takes on a purposeful air, turns, strides up the path, up onto the porch of the house, opens the door, goes in
- () Lila is at the cabin's rear window, looking out, straining for a glimpse of the old house, which cannot be seen from the window of this cabin
She turns, frustrated, anxious
Sam is standing at the foot of the bed, staring at the smooth coverlet, his brow creased in a sadness
We should have asked for Cabin One
The one Mary was in
'm glad we didn't
He pulls his eyes from the bed, crosses to the desk, sits wearily, lights a cigarette
Lila watches him for a moment, feels a real compassion, goes to the bed, sits on its edge, turns again and looks at Sam's back
We have to go into that cabin and search it, Sam
no matter what we're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt
know
( pause) Do you think if something happened, it happened there
( pause, then:) Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel
one you probably couldn't even sell
what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else
(As Sam studies her) Forty thousand dollars
How could we prove
(An almost hopeless laugh) Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway
say, a year from now
There must be some proof that exists right now
Something that proves he got that money away from Mary
Some way
What makes you sound so certain
Arbogast
Sam, he liked me
or felt sorry for me
and he was starting to feel the same about you
heard it when he called
in his voice, a caring
He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done anything without telling us
Unless he was stopped
And he was stopped, so he must have found out something
Sam considers a moment, nods agreement, rises
We'll start with Cabin One
He goes to the door, opens it slightly, looks out, then, back to Lila: If he sees us
we're just taking the air
Lila goes to the door
He holds it open and she goes out
- () Sam closes the door, joins Lila, takes her hand
Together they walk along the porch in the direction of Cabin One
They pause before the door of Cabin One
Sam motions Lila to wait, to hold still, then goes on to the office, opens the door, calls in: Bates
He waits, there is no response
He goes in and in a moment comes back out, closes the door, goes to Lila
She has already opened the door of Cabin One and has started to enter
- () The blinds are closed and the room is almost night-dark
Sam comes in after Lila, closes the door behind him
For a moment they just gaze at the room, as if willing it to tell them some satisfactory story
Neither speaks
Then, in dark silence, they begin to search, going methodically and thoroughly through all drawers, the closet, the desk, searching under the bed and in dark corners, not knowing what they expect to find and yet expecting to find some thing
Lila opens the bathroom door, looks in
The windowless room is very dark
She switches on the light, goes in
Sam moves toward the bathroom, is about to follow her in when he notices which room it is and automatically catches himself up, backs out
Sorry
Hospital clean
What
The bathroom
Look at how clean it is
The one in our cabin is clean
but this is clean
Sam goes in, glances around, nods
Lila goes through the medicine cabinet, finds nothing but a glass and two tiny tabs of soap
Sam leans against the door-jamb, looks at the tub, the shower pipe above it
He continues to stare, more interested suddenly, as if bothered by some off-key evidence he can't put his finger on
Then he looks at the shower curtain rod
And realizes there is no shower curtain
He frowns, is about to say something when Lila, who has been momentarily out of shot, interrupts
Sam turns,  , and we see Lila is standing above the toilet bowl, a tiny piece of wet paper stuck to the tip of her right index finger
What is it
It didn't get washed down
It's figuring
the kind you tear up and get rid of
(Extending her finger toward Sam) Some figure has been added to or subtracted from
forty thousand
Sam lifts the piece of paper off her finger, studies it, takes out his wallet, presses the wet scrap to his driver's license shield, puts it back in the wallet and puts the wallet away
That's proof Mary was here
It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to
(Reminding) Bates never denied Mary was here
(Reminded) Yes
( thought) But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it
Sam, that old woman, whoever she is
think she told Arbogast something
And  want her to tell us the same thing
She starts out of the bathroom
Sam takes hold of her arm, stops her
You can't go up there
Why not
Bates
from them, moves slowly over the room, very slowly
'  (
) Let's find him
One of us can keep him occupied while the other gets to the woman
'  (
) You won't be able to hold him still if he doesn't want to be held
And don't like you going into that house alone, Lila
clear across to the opposite wall now, and is moving up closer and closer to the tiny-flowered wall paper, finally closing in on one small rosebud
'  (
) can handle a sick old woman
Now we see that the rosebud has been cut out, that this is the reverse side of the hole Norman peeped through to watch Mary
And we see the pupil of Norman's eye now
'  (
) All right
'll find Bates and keep him occupied
The eye moves away and there is a brief flash of light before the hole is covered, on the other side, by the wall-hung painting
- They are about to start out
Sam stops her again
Wait a minute
If you get anything out of the mother
( thought) Can you find your way back to town
(As Lila nods yes) If you do get anything, don't stop to tell me
Lila nods quickly, hurries to the door
Sam gets to it first, opens it a slight crack, looks out, then opens it wide enough for Lila and Himself to pass through
- () on cabin one as Lila comes out, turns to her left, goes along porch toward cabin twelve
Sam remains at the door, then turns right, heading for the path
As he passes the office, he is shocked to see Norman standing just inside the open door
Looking for me
(Recovering) Yes, matter of fact
(The friendly grin) The wife's taking a nap and
can never keep quiet enough for her
so  thought 'd look you up and
talk
Satisfied with your cabin
Fine
Sam starts into the office
Just before going in, he glances down the long porch, sees Lila standing outside the door of cabin twelve, waves her a tiny "all clear" signal
to include Lila and her point of view
She watches Sam disappear into the office, waits until she hears the door close, then looks about for another way to reach the house
She sees the small alley at the end of this of cabins, starts toward it
-
- () Behind the motel Lila hesitates
She looks ahead
- () The old house standing against the sky
- () Lila moves forward
- () The  approaching the house
- () Lila glances toward the back of Norman's parlor
She moves on
- () The house coming nearer
- () Lila looks up at the house
She moves forward purposefully
- () The house and the porch
- () Lila stops at the house and looks up
She glances back
She turns to the house again
- () The   the steps to the porch
- () Lila puts out her hand
- () Lila's hand pushes the door open
We see the hallway
Lila
- () Lila closes the door, remains by it for a moment, quiet, listening
Her eyes scan the layout, the closed door which leads off the hallway, to the dining room on the right and the parlor on the left
Down at the end of the hall is the kitchen, the door wide open, the room beyond dim and silent
She notices the stairs leading down to the basement, stares at them, then back to the stairs leading to the second floor
She starts forward, and seems about to investigate the parlor and dining room
- () Norman is behind the counter, standing, staring at Sam who is sitting relaxedly on a small sofa
Norman has the look of one who is protecting himself, as if the counter were a protective wall against the threatening world across it
(Cheerfully, as if after a self-conscious pause) 've been doing all the talking so far, haven't
Yes
always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance
Yet there you are, doing all the listening
( pause) You are alone here, aren't you
(As Norman does not reply) It would drive me crazy
That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it
(Lightly) Just an expression
(More seriously) What  meant was
'd do just about anything
to get away
Wouldn't you
- () Lila is halfway up the stairs
As she climbs she is startled by the creaks and groans of the old wood of the steps
She steps more carefully
remains at foot of stair, as Lila climbs
She pauses at the head of the stair
The door on her right, which opens into the mother's room, is closed
To her left is another door, half-open
Directly before her is a third door, closed
She holds a long moment, trying to picture in her mind which room would look out on the front of the house, decides, chooses the correct door, the one on her right
She goes to it, knocks lightly
'  () - We hear Lila's second knock, then, faintly, her soft call
'  (
) Mrs
Bates
There is quiet for a moment, then the door begins to open, and we see Lila
She stands on the threshold, looking in at the room, instantly disturbed by it, almost chilled, her expression indicating an impulse to close the door and go away from this room forever
After a moment, she enters, leaving the door open behind her
and we now see the room as Lila sees it
It is ornate, damask-and-mahogany, thick and warm and ripe, an olla podrida of mismated furnishings and bric-a-brac of the last century
The bed is four poster, but uncanoped; the dressing table is fancy and flounced with satin; there is a great chiffonier, a big-doored wardrobe, a large, oval, full- length pier-glass (this against the wall directly opposite the door), a satin recamier, an upholstered armchair by the window, a white marble fireplace, its grate cold but piled with ashes
And there is in the room an unmistakably live quality, as if even though it is presently unoccupied, it has not been long vacated by some musty presence
Lila glances at the bed
The damask coverlet is thrown over it, but it is not neat, there is the imprint of a body on it, a body which obviously has slept in a curled-up, womb- like position
Lila stares at it for a moment, up, then goes to the dressing table
Its top is scattered with boxes and jars of cosmetics and creams, traces of fresh powder, an opened bottle or perfume, a comb, and a brush with traces of hair in its bristles
Lila moves on, catches a glimpse of herself in the pier-glass, is startled, turns away, goes to the chiffonier, is about to open a drawer, sees the high wardrobe out of the corner of her eyes, goes to it, hesitantly
She opens one door
Fresh, clean, well pressed dresses hang neatly
Lila opens the other door
The sweaters and dresses and robes hang freely, none in moth-proof, storage- type bags
There is even a well-brushed collar of foxes
Along the floor of the wardrobe is a line of clean, polished shoes
Lila stares, then closes the door, turns, looks once again over the whole room, starts out, - () Lila comes out of the mother's room, closes the door behind her, looks down the stairs, then starts across the hall to the room whose door is half-open
The room within is dark, the shades drawn full
Lila pauses on the threshold, reaches in, feels the wall, throws on a switch
- () Sam has risen, is standing by the counter now
'm not saying you shouldn't be contented here, 'm just doubting that you are
think if you saw a chance to get out from under
you'd unload this place
(Angrily) This place
This isn't 'a place
' It's my only world
grew up in that house back there
was a happy child
My mother and
we were more than happy
And now that your mother's dead
Norman snaps a sharp, fast, ugly look at him
My mother is not dead
(Softly) didn't think so
'      - () Lila is standing in the doorway, staring at the room in sick dismay
The room is grotesque, a horrible, ludicrous fantasy of childhood held beyond the point of decency
It is a small room
The walls are fancied with romping silhouettes of teddy-bears and sailboats and carousels and fat cows jumping over aghast moons
The bed is small, far too short for a man of Norman's height
And yet the rumpled covers indicate that it is in this bed that Norman sleeps
Next to the bed is an old-fashioned toy chest
On its top there are a bird-in-a-cage lamp, a plain-bound book, and an ash tray filled with ashes and cigarette stubs
grown man's shirt hangs on a child's clothes tree
Against one wall there is a narrow, high bookcase filled with thick, unchildish-looking books
On the small, white chest of drawers there is an old, child's victrola
The record on the turntable is discovered, on close inspection, to be Beethoven's Eroica Symphony
Lila studies the room, fascinated and repelled
She glances at the bookcase, comes into the room, goes to the bookcase and pulls out a thick, large, plain-bound book
She opens it
Her eyes go wide in shock
And then there is disgust
She slams the book closed, drops it
- () Norman, behind the counter, has moved back against the wall
Sam is still on the other side of the counter, but is leaning forward, his eyes hard on Norman's face
Norman's face is no longer expressionless
It has the stark, high sheen of a cornered animal
(Pressing) You look frightened
Have  been saying something frightening
don't know what you've been saying
've been talking about your mother
about your motel
How are you going to do it
Do what
Buy a new one
In a new town
Where you won't have to hide your mother
Shut up
Where will you get the money to do that, Bates
or do you already have it
socked away
a lot of it
Leave me alone
Forty thousand dollars
Leave me alone
He is close to panic now
He turns, swiftly, dashes back into his private parlor
Sam goes quickly around the counter, follows
'   - () Norman hears Sam following, wants to run, to never be reached by this man
He crosses the small room, drawn to the rear window, as if he might fly through it
Sam enters, pauses
Norman turns, back against the window, as unable to fly away as are the many still, stuffed birds
Sam registers a brief flicker of reaction when he sees the birds, but continues to gaze at Norman, hard
bet your mother knows where the money is
And what you did to get it
And  think she'll tell us
Something self-assured and confident in Sam's tone gives Norman a new, more terrified alarm
He turns his head, glances out the window at the old house
He looks back at Sam and there is terror in his voice
Where's that girl
The girl you came with
Where is she
Sam does not respond, smiles a half-smile, turns to examine a stuffed owl
Norman looks back at the house
( horrible groan) Oh, God
- () Lila, shaken and disturbed, almost sickened, is coming out of Norman's room
She has left the light on
She pauses in the middle of the landing, looks at the closed door opposite the stairs, goes to it, opens it, sees that it is the bathroom, pulls the door to, turns, starts toward the stairs
'   - () Sam is lying on the floor, face downward, unmoving candlestick is on the floor, close by his head, still rocking as if just dropped
comes the  of Norman's footsteps and   in time to catch a brief glimpse of him going out into the office, almost at a run
- () Lila is on the top step, looking down toward
She is listening, hoping to hear some human sound, some sound she might follow, pursue
She hears nothing
She starts down the stairs
Just below the halfway step, she looks at the front door, sees out through the door window: '  - () Norman coming
- () For a moment Lila panics, then she hurries down the steps, cannot go in the direction of the front door, remembers the stairway behind her, turns and runs in that direction
The of Norman bounding up the porch steps can be heard
Lila turns and dashes down the stairs which lead to the basement, going down far enough to conceal herself, crouching there
Norman enters the hallway, closes the door softly, listens
He glances once in the direction of the basement stairs
He seems about to smile, when suddenly all expression vanishes from his face, and he appears to enter a no-place, no-time state
He crosses to the stairway, goes up
Lila remains crouched on the basement stairs, listening to the  of Norman
His footsteps on the stairs followed by the fast noises of doors opening, of fast moving about an upstairs room
Convinced that he is searching the upstairs for her, she decides to chance an escape
She starts up the steps, is about to turn into the hallway when her eye is caught by a glimmer of light down in the basement
She pauses, looks down, sees the crack of light coming from behind the not entirely closed door to the fruit cellar
The swift moving of Norman continue to come from upstairs
Lila is torn, knows she should get out of the house while she has the chance, is unable to resist the impulse to check that hidden-looking room down below, a room in which, she desperately believes, there must lie some answer to what happened to Mary
She turns and goes softly and quickly down the stairs
- () Lila reaches the bottom, stops, listens, hears the stairboards creaking as footsteps fall hard and measured upon them
She turns, pulls open the fruit cellar door, looks in
The woman is sitting in a comfortable chair, the back of the chair, and the woman, turned to the door
Lila calls a harsh, frightened whisper
Mrs
Bates
Lila goes into the room
Lila goes to the chair, touches it
The touch disturbs the figure
It starts to turn, slowly, stiffly, a clock-wise movement
Lila looks at it in horror
It is the body of a woman long dead
The skin is dry and pulled away from the mouth and the teeth are revealed as in the skeleton's smile
The eyes are gone from their sockets, the bridge of the nose has collapsed, the hair is dry and wild, the cheeks are sunken, the leathery-brown skin is powdered and rouged and flaky
The body is dressed in a high-neck, clean, well-pressed dress, obviously recently laundered and hand-ironed
The movement of this stuffed, ill-preserved cadaver, turning as if in response to Lila's call and touch, is actually graceful, ballet-like, and the effect is terrible and obscene
Lila gazes for one flicker of a deathly moment, then begins to scream, a high, piercing, dreadful scream
And Lila's scream is joined by another scream, a more dreadful, horrifying scream which comes from the door behind her
'  (
) (screaming) Ayeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Am Norma Bates
Lila turns
His face is contorted
He wears a wild wig, a mockery of a woman's hair
He is dressed in a high-neck dress which is similar to that worn by the corpse of his mother
His hand is raised high, poised to strike at Lila
There is a long breadknife in it
Close on her face
She is dumb-struck
Her eyes are screaming
As he is about to start forward, a man's hand reaches in from the doorway behind, grabs Norman's wrist
Sam comes through the door, still holding tight to the wrist, pulling back the arm and at the same time throwing himself at Norman, football tackle style
- Norman and Sam, struggling
The wild fury in Norman's face, the mad noise of his screams and vile curses
The terrified, fight-to-the-death look of Sam
The still, staring Lila
close of her face, She appears to be watching and enjoying the fight
Over the shot, the  of the struggle, the screams of Norman
: - () There are many people gathered about the steps, the curious and the concerned and the morbid
At the curb, a couple of newspaper cars, two or three police cars, and a mobile unit truck from the local television outlet
There is noise, and chattering as questions are asked and answers given, and the sounds of traffic, and of the television equipment being moved into the courthouse, for on-the-scene reporting, and the stern voices of policemen trying to keep people back
The scene has a bright glare about it, that quality of sudden light thrown on a fearful darkness
trying to make way for the television men, muttering "keep back," etc
, to the spectators , carrying a piece of equipment goes through door, and him into the courthouse vestibule
Here, too, there is a crowd, composed of Policemen, Reporters, Television Men
The Television Men we have been following stops beside a Policeman
(Indicating the front door he has just come in through) You think they'll take him out that way
(Looking at waiting crowd, shrugging) Probably have to
( rueful smile) Besides, the taxpayers hate it when something gets slipped out the back door on them
Over this exchange, the buzz of other voices, the movement of men
, down the corridor, gets to the door of the office of the Chief of Police just as a young fellow with a carton box filled with paper containers of sent-out- for coffee reaches this door
as the pauses a moment, then goes into the room
: - () Lila is seated in a chair, Sam standing close by
bit apart from them, we see Sheriff Chambers, in quiet conference with the   , the  , the The Coffee Boy stands in the doorway
Sam goes to him, takes a container of coffee from the box, carries it to Lila, checking the notation on the lid as he goes
(quietly) It's regular
Okay
(ruefully) could stand something regular
Sam smiles encouragingly, hands her the coffee
Sheriff Chambers  , gives Sam a container of coffee he has brought for him
Sam takes it, nods a thank you
For a moment no one speaks
Lila looks badly shaken, Sam disheveled, but contained
You two can go on home if you like
(a sympathetic look at Lila) Making that statement was enough for one night
(to Lila) Want to
No
'm all right
'll feel better when all this is explained
if it can be
Sam looks a question at Sheriff Chambers
Chambers shrugs doubtfully
If anybody gets any answers, it'll be the fellow talking to him now
the Psychiatrist
Even  couldn't reach Norman
and he knows me
(to Lila) You warm enough, Miss
Lila is about to answer, when she sees someone come into the room and rises anxiously
Sam and Sheriff Chambers turn, follow her gaze
- young man with a serious, frowning face has just come into the room
He is
, the Psychiatrist
He goes to the desk where the box of coffee containers has been placed, takes up a container
Did he talk to you
No
got the whole story
but not from Norman
got it from
his mother
Everyone gazes at him, mystified
He speaks as he removes lid from coffee container
Norman Bates no longer exists
He only half-existed to begin with
now, the other half has taken over
Probably for all time
(With difficulty) Did he kill my sister
Yes
and no
Look, if you're trying to lay a lot of psychiatric groundwork for some sort of plea this fellow would like to cop
psychiatrist doesn't lay the groundwork
he merely tries to explain it
But my sister is
Yes
'm sorry
(to Chambers) The Private Investigator, too
If you drag that swamp somewhere in the vicinity of the motel
(To the Chief of Police) Have you any unsolved missing persons cases on your books
Yes
Two
Young girls
(nods, astounded, then:) Did he confess to
(interrupting) As  said, the mother
(Pauses, goes on afresh) To understand it, as  understood it hearing it from the mother
That is, from the mother-half of Norman's mind, you have to go back ten years
to the time when Norman murdered his mother and her lover
( pause, then as no one interrupts) He was already dangerously disturbed, had been ever since his father died
His mother was a clinging, demanding woman
and for years the two of them lived as if there was no one else in the world
Then she met a man and it seemed to Norman she "threw him over" for this man
That pushed him over the thin line
and he killed them both
Matricide is probably the most unbearable crime of all
and most unbearable to the son who commit it
So he had to erase the crime, at least in his own mind
( pause) He stole her corpse
and a weighted coffin was buried
He hid the body in the fruit cellar, even "treated" it to keep it as well as it would keep
And that still wasn't enough
She was there, but she was a corpse
So he began to think and speak for her, gave her half his life, so to speak
At times he could be both personalities, carry on conversations
at other times, the mother-half took over completely
He was never all Norman, but he was often only mother
And because he was so pathologically jealous of her, he assumed she was as jealous of him
Therefore, if he felt a strong attraction to any other woman, the mother side of him would go wild
(To Lila) When Norman met your sister, he was touched by her
and aroused by her
He wanted her
And this set off his "jealous mother" and
"mother killed the girl
" After the murder, Norman returned as if from a deep sleep
and like a dutiful son, covered up all traces of the crime he was convinced his mother had committed
Why was he
dressed like that
He's a transvestite
Not exactly
man who dresses in woman's clothing in order to achieve a sexual change
or satisfaction
is a transvestite
But in Norman's case, he was simply doing everything possible to keep alive the illusion of his mother being alive
And whenever reality came too close, when danger or desire threatened that illusion, he'd dress up, even to a cheap wig he brought, and he'd walk about the house, sit in her chair, speak in her voice
He tried to be his mother
( sad smile) And now he is
( pause) That's what  meant when  said got the story from the mother
She thinks Norman has been taken away
because of his crimes
She insists she did nothing, that Norman committed all the murders just to keep her from being discovered
She even smiled a bit coquettishly as she said that
Of course, she feels badly about it
but also somewhat relieved to be, as she put it, free of Norman, at last
( pause) When the mind houses two personalities, there is always a battle
In Norman's case, the battle is over
and the dominant personality has won
Lila begins to weep softly, for Mary, for Arbogast, for Norman, for all the destroyed human beings of this world
Sam bends beside her, puts his arm about her, comforts her
(To Simon) And the forty thousand dollars
Who got that
The swamp
These were murders of passion, not profit
puts his head in the door, speaks, in a near- whisper, to the Chief of Police
The Guard is carrying a folded blanket over his arm
He feels a little chill
can bring him this blanket
The Chief of Police nods
The Guard goes away, and him out of the room and out into the hallway
Guard moves through the waiting men, heading down the corridor
: narrower corridor in the rear of the building
In f
g
of shot, we see a door, the top half of which is wire-covered glass
in uniform is posted by the door, looking reprovingly at the two or three people trying to get a glance into the room
The Police Guard, carrying the blanket, comes down this corridor, goes to the door
The uniformed Guard opens the door, allows the man to go in
Shot is  so that we can not see into the room
After a moment, the Guard comes out and the uniformed Guard closes and locks the door and we : '   - () The walls are white and plain
There is no window
There is no furniture except the straight-back chair in which Norman sits, in the center of the room
The room has a quality of no-whereness, of calm separation from the world
The Police Guard has placed the blanket on Norman's knees
Norman, as we come upon him, is lifting the blanket, unfolding it
His face, although without makeup and without the surrounding softness of the wig, has a certain femininity about it, a softness about the mouth and a kind of arch womanliness about the brows
Calmly, Norman places the blanket about his shoulders, as if it were a cashmere shawl
in a position so that our view of Norman is a
When the shawl is in position, and Norman is settled, we ,  , the voice of his mother, coming from the calm of his thoughts
'  (
) It's sad
when a mother has to speak the words that condemn her own son
but  couldn't allow them to believe that  would commit murder
( pause) They'll put him away now
as should have
years ago
He was always
bad
And in the end, he intended to tell them  killed those girls
and that man
As if  could do anything except just sit and stare
like one of his stuffed birds
( pause) Well, they know  can't even move a finger
And  won't
'll just sit here and be quiet
Just in case they do
suspect me
fly buzzes close, and then continues buzzing and flying about Norman's face
'  (
) They're probably watching me
Well, let them
Let them see what kind of a person  am
( pause, as the fly lights on Norman's hand) 'm not going to swat that fly hope they are watching
They'll see
they'll see
and they'll know
and they'll say
'why, she wouldn't even harm a fly
' Norman continues to gaze ahead into nothing
: As    , we see the swamp, the chain of a tow- truck
The chain is attached to Mary's car
The car is coming out of the swamp
