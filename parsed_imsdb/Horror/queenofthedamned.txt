As we  an old stone tomb, the boots leap up and to reveal: stands steadily atop the roof of the tomb, silhouetted against the moon like a large, black bird

The longing to be mortal returns, a longing for finiteness

Everything in my body wanted to be with them couldn't help myself
Then, from somewhere in the room, an   begins to hum the most hypnotic melody over the tune, melding in exquisite harmony
Arching her neck in some higher ecstasy, Maudy looks across the makeshift studio and suddenly stops playing
What the hell, Maudy
Seeing Maudy's stunned face, Alex and James turn to see Lestat perched like a raven on top of the stack of speakers, eyes closed, still humming to the fading reverb of the guitars
Slowly opening his cool grey eyes -- Please don't stop
What the f-- How did you get in here

James and Alex look at the door on the other side of the attic -- they should have seen him
Maudy stares at Lestat, quite taken by the handsome vampire's looks -- Drinking Maudy in with his eyes -- Your music woke me from the longest sleep

In two hundred years 've never heard anything quite like it

The French Journalist looks a little frightened/fascinated by Lestat's leer
Why not a demo at your own house

Is it true you move residences every few days

(quickly, trying to cover) But listen, if you look closely, you can see they're vampires

And Lestat's leading us to them and -- #3 (interrupting) Interesting
Perhaps we should assign someone to observe -- #1 Oh please, based on this so-called 'data'
That's a waste of time
But

You're just an apprentice here
You must follow our rules
Or perhaps we need to reconsider your position
She stares at him
#3 For 12 centuries our mission as Talamascans has been to observe and record paranormal behavior
But never get involved
You're getting far too close
(gesturing to photo, defending herself) Hey, does it look like  got involved
That is not called involvement
That is called running
#2 (leaning forward, trying to help) But, Jesse, tell us, what did you see
Jesse turns to her
Vampires
Gathering
'm sure of it
Jesse steps from the podium, moving through the Talamascans as she pleads her case
She talks a mile a minute, her passion rising
You have to listen to Lestat's lyrics
They're amazing

Plus there are historical details dating back hundreds of years Lestat describes that don't exist anywhere
except in our library
He refers to Marius, the great white lord, who ruled over a group of islands off the Bay of Naples in the late 18th Century
What 'm trying to say here, and maybe 'm not doing the best job of it, is that Lestat may be the oldest and most powerful vampire ever documented
Jesse sees some of the Talamascans are again listening
But Talamascan #1 shakes his head
#1 It doesn't make any sense
Why would he be forecasting this to the world
He's all but drawn a map and marked an
What vampires hold sacred is keeping their kind a secret
You never name other immortals, tell where their lairs are
They'd be hunted down
Right
That's the best part
Lestat's not afraid to piss them off
He wants mortals and immortals to know he's there, to know he exists
don't know why
(glancing at skeptical Talamascan #1) But this has never happened before
Don't you see
He's a one man revolution
All the Talamascans gaze at her a moment
Jesse holds her breath
Has she gotten them back

It's hardly conclusive
(snorts) 'mon
It looks like the Blair witch
The Talamascans burst out laughing, even Talamascan #2
Jesse gazes at them, her face burning red
She's lost them, blown it
Made a fool of herself
Her frustration rises, she can no longer contain it
It bursts out of her
Fine
Well then,  guess 'll just have to go back and get better, more conclusive evidence
Maybe you just can't unravel all the mysteries of the world out there, by sitting around all day in a dusty old library in here
As they gaze at her, astonished, she gathers her materials, starts out
Several start shouting back at her
Amidst the uproar, a voice booms across the room

Everyone turns
Quiets down
stands in the back of the room
He's clearly the superior Talamascan, though younger than some, very charismatic

It doesn't look good

He smiles at her, forcefully changes the mood
Alright

Jesse starts out
Looking down at papers on his desk, Talbot calls out, almost casually
Well, all  can say is you're really lucky you're not lying dead in a gutter with two holes on your neck

Though your research is top-notch of course

'm gonna show you something
He goes to the paintings hanging on a wall in the back of his office, covered with black velvet
Jesse follows
He unveils them
They stand before an Eighteenth-Century painting
The interior of an enormous Italian villa
There's a man in his forties with long white hair, back to us, but his face is reflected in a standing mirror
What do you see
They're all nightscapes
The detail is amazing
Mid-1500s
Florence
Right
And what do you see in this one
Jesse moves to the next painting
Another nightscape, a giant medieval tableaux, circa Bruegel
And  know it's a Dutch pastoral
Jesse runs her finger across the faces, then stops on the face of a gentleman with long white hair watching the bloodshed of gory battles and the sacrifices of saints burned at the stake
This man is in both
Right
He's in all of them
Jesse moves to the next painting, then the next and the next, all nightscapes set and painted in the style of different eras, all featuring a portrait of the same white-maned man

All painted at the time of that particular style
Jesse stops at a contemporary self-portrait
It's Marius, Jesse

From Lestat's lyrics

Yes, you were
Good work
She smiles at him, victorious
've been personally tracing him for decades
My little obsession
The oldest vampire ever documented
The closest we've come to the original vampire
What do you mean the original vampire
Pointing to a larger depiction of a beautiful woman in Egyptian garb -- There's a Mesopotamian legend that there once was a queen of Egypt, Akasha, long before Tutankhamen or Nefertiti
She was believed to be the original vampire
Marius himself dates back to 400
Jesse gazes at all the paintings, shaking her head in wonder, then speaks softly

(without looking at him) Don't you ever want to just go and find him and -- Talbot crosses to her
No
Jesus, we are not talking about having a drink at the Dorchester, Jesse
You know that
Especially with the ancient vampires -- the older they are, the more powerful, the more dangerous
He takes her by the arm, smiles down at her
Anyway, you don't need to go and stake out some club
Your time is too valuable
have something far better for you
(surprised) You do
He steers her over to a locked cabinet
Yes
And 'll tell you something
've never shown this to anyone
No one else has proved themself in the way you have
(touched) Thanks
What is it
As he unlocks the cabinet
Oh you're gonna love this

He gives her the diary
Thank you for this
My pleasure
When  took you on as an apprentice,  knew it was the smartest thing 'd ever done

But after the door closes, his gaze turns again to concern
He crosses back to the paintings, pauses a moment, staring up into Marius's eyes

huge antique bed sits in the room's center, and on it
Lestat lays feverish and fitful, dressed in a soft linen nightshirt
His neck wears a swollen bite
Another flash of lightning suddenly jolts him awake
His hands feel the inflamed wound as he sees
An indistinct shape of a man dressed in draping red velvet, sitting asleep in a chair across the room
An easel stands before him, holding an unseen painting
Lestat rises out of the bed and grabs his clothes from a nearby Louis  chair
He makes for a door when
Lestat suddenly stops
He looks back to see the painting that stands on the easel
It's a portrait of himself in ancient Roman garb, like the god Mars, complete with his blond hair and fiery blue eyes
Unable to help himself, he approaches the painting, completely fascinated by his own image, when suddenly
The sleeping man leaps up, grabs   Lestat unmercifully and again plunges his teeth into the   young man's neck
Lestat fights as best he can but   his strength is no match as he's slowly drawn down to the   floor
Finally
The strange man lifts himself up from Lestat's neck to reveal the face of the vampire , the mysterious figure
Wiping his blooded mouth on his painter's cloth -- Lestat
Welcome
Weakened and helpless, Lestat drags himself back across the floor in terror

Marius advances again on the young man
But you may call me Marius
As Lestat keeps weakly dragging himself away
'm the lord of a great manor
They'll send an army of men to look for me
doubt they'll find you, Lord De Lioncourt
You're a long way from home
His strength leaving him, Lestat slumps flat on the floor
You're weak
near passing can barely hear your heartbeat
'll kill you
Marius smiles, impressed
You really do fear nothing
It is why  chose you
Because you think things are possible which aren't possible
Lestat stares at him, his eyes wide
Chose me
For what
My companion
Someone to share my burden
Bending down, he gazes at Lestat
You've lost a great deal of blood

Suddenly Marius draws a knife from a Roman sheath on his belt
With the last of his strength, Lestat grabs his attacker's wrist
Then drink
Guiding Lestat's hand with the knife, Marius smiles and cuts his own arm, opening his veins
Lestat stares in true terror as Marius lets his blood drip onto Lestat's lip
Lestat pulls away as the blood slides into his mouth
Good, is it not
And indeed
it does taste good
That's the new terror that's gripping him
He crosses himself and stares up into Marius's gentle eyes
Marius bends down, cups Lestat's chin
Drink and live
You've been brave enough for one night, my son
Marius brings his open vein to Lestat's lips
Lestat hesitates, but then suddenly
Feeds hungrily as Marius's face fills with the bond
He slowly sinks down to his knees as Lestat feeds and feeds
As Lestat drinks, a barrage of  flood into him
52                                                            52 of Marius's life through the ages

Marius begins to weaken, himself

But Lestat keeps on feeding hungrily
No
no more
Lestat, no more
With one great move, Marius pulls Lestat off his arm and tosses him across the floor twenty feet away
Marius reels back, clamping his open vein with his hand as Lestat curls on the ground, gasping ecstatically from the rush
Slowly, Lestat starts to feel something
Pain begins travelling through his body, consuming him until he screams
Marius crosses to Lestat convulsing on the floor
He kneels and gently wipes his brow
Lestat's body thrashes as he grabs at his own limbs
Don't be afraid, it's only your body that dies
Wiping his brow as he dies
Then, Lestat's face still buried in his arms, he begins to laugh almost drunkenly
Raising his head, his metamorphosis is clear as his face pales and his eyes fill with a new kind of power

Lestat smiles with red glistening lips

When you feed, you must hold back from the moment of death
You must never take the last drop, or it will draw you in and you will die
The fisherman is moaning
Looking down at the suffering victim, Marius swiftly snaps his neck and dumps him into a boat
He picks up an oar, and with vampire strength, drives it like a stake through the bottom of the boat
Water starts bubbling in
Remember, there is wisdom in the flesh, Lestat
man wears his history on his skin
Marius feels Lestat's gaze, turns to him
'm talking about humanity
As Lestat watches the water begin to fill the bottom of the boat
Humanity
(snort) We're murderers
We're more than that

their life, their knowledge, their complexity
Appreciate your prey, Lestat

) My senses run amok, like a newborn child
And as for my new powers, was beside myself with the pleasure of it all
The trick is to find the way to face eternity head on
The spirit can be annihilated by boredom just as the body can be destroyed by sun or fire
My solace, my delight, is witnessing the unfolding of human destiny
Lestat gazes at Marius's eyes dancing with intellectual fervor
As they walk, they pass a group of teenagers, just younger than Lestat, at a bonfire, dancing, laughing
Lestat gazes over at them as he and Marius pass, hidden in shadow
From Christ to the Dark Ages to the enlightenment, 've never been able to divine what was coming
That's what keeps me going -- can't wait to see what human beings are going to do next
Lestat nods, taking it in
They pass another bonfire
floats through the night
An  , 50, plays balalaika while his daughter, 18, plays violin with great passion
Who could've predicted the Enlightenment
Or Hannibal and his elephants
Marius stops talking, turns
Lestat is no longer beside him

We are the powerful, we are the immortal
We should walk fearless in the open
Shhh
The life of a vampire is a life of discretion
We must sleep during the day, when we are vulnerable to the sun
Mortals must never know about us
It is forbidden, for the sake of all our kind

Not unless you wanted to kill her
(beat, quietly, intensely) So  can never be known
You're known by me
granted you that
There are others of our kind
though most are solitary creatures
Lestat's eyes fill with some existential realization
My God
Forget God
You're no longer in his realm
Now we must leave
Relenting, Lestat starts to follow
But the music quickens
Lestat pauses, turns back
As if the music is calling to him
The girl still faces into the shadows towards him, and plays fast and wild, her fingers flying
Lestat stands there frozen to the spot
The music pulses through him
He gazes at her fingers, studying their intricate movements intensely

Lestat starts clapping along to the music, exuberantly
The girl and Father smile, nod to him as they play
Marius, in the shadows, is fuming
Lestat's eyes fill with the moment, the girl's vitality
He notices that sitting on the ground by the girl are several instruments
Impulsively, he reaches over, picks up a violin
He studies the girl's playing again, then with his new powers, as if by osmosis
Begins to play with exactly her skill, exactly her movements
The girl and her Father laugh, delighted with this new musician
Lestat plays along with them, joyful, exhilarated
The girl's fingers fly
Lestat's fingers pick up speed
Faster
Faster
glittering torrent of notes fly out of his violin as if made of gold
Unconsciously, Lestat steps closer to the music, into firelight
The Father and his daughter become less certain, as they gaze at Lestat's strange, pale, glowing skin, the luminous shine of eyes
But Lestat is completely taken by the music, the moment
The Father and the daughter, sensing something strange, stop playing
Lestat looks up
Sees terror in their eyes
The Father is slowly backing away, pointing in horror at Lestat

Lightning fast, out of the shadows, steps Marius
He grabs the Father
The girl drops her violin, turns, starts running down the beach to a bonfire in the distance
Stop her, Lestat
Lestat turns to Marius, shaking his head no in horror
You must
Lestat hesitates, then runs after the girl
She turns back, sees him getting closer, starts to scream
Lestat is suddenly in front of her with his hand over her mouth, covering her muffled scream
Her struggle is no use against his strength
Reaching up to her neck, he touches it
He looks into her terrified eyes

Tosses him in a boat
Lestat gazes at the lifeless body of the girl
Marius turns to Lestat, furious
will not have you put everything at risk
You will mind our laws
Picking up Lestat's victim, Marius tosses her into the boat as well
We remain in the shadows
To do otherwise is a road to destruction
Marius turns to Lestat, who stands in silence, gazing at the girl and her Father
(quietly) see you still have a few lingering mortal emotions
They will serve you no good, Lestat
Lestat turns to Marius, shaking his head, speaks in a horrified whisper
My God, what have you done to me
Lestat turns again toward the bodies of the dead girl and her Father, his face filled with pain, enormous sadness
(whisper) She's just a child
forgive me

"Mine eyes dazzle, she died so young

Several bonfires line the lane, illuminating rows of prone bodies, cardboard shelters, empty bottles
The drunks look up at her with dead eyes

In the distance she sees the blue light
Figures moving through the fog
Jesse moves slowly along a wall in the shadows trying to get a better look
Suddenly, out of the shadows, a She starts, quickens her pace
Runs straight into a bulky figure
primal scream rises from her stomach
The figure is a homeless drunk, more scared than she is, who scuttles off quickly into the night
Jesse presses her back against the wall
Breathes
She inches around the corner

The slot in the door slides open

Jesse takes a deep breath, then

Jesse follows the couples in
The door shuts behind her

The bar is comprised of elaborately-carved Chinese dragons, a  mounted incongruously in the corner showing a silent Vampire Lestat video
Couples dance cheek to cheek, rotating like figures on a music box
Another couple is necking hot and heavy in the corner
Jesse stares at the patrons of this vampire coven
Many of the faces are unnaturally pale, gaunt
Their eyes shine with a strange, reflective light
Jesse moves through the tables, passing a mortal - sitting with a   he's obviously just met that night
Wow
This is the coolest after hours club ever
You sure you don't want a drink
Soon
The Vampire Girl smiles, glances up at Jesse as she passes
Jesse looks away quickly, moves on
The pianist watches as she passes by
The couple necking in the corner begins to get even more aroused
mortal girl sips on her drink while her lover, a vampire, kisses her shoulder, her throat
63                                                        63 Unaware that she is being watched, Jesse continues her circuit

Getting a sudden chill, the Goth girl takes her drink and moves back into the crowd as the vampire looks after her with murderous eyes

an even briefer flash as her vampire lover comes up for air, his lips and teeth shiny with blood

Sure, all the time

#1 Don't see any marks
You haven't seen the rest of my body
#2 Is that an invitation
Jesse finds herself surrounded by the three Vampires
She shakes her head, too frightened to get out a response
#3 So, where's your host
My host
oh he's here somewhere
She peers into the darkness, starts moving towards the door
Finds herself blocked by Punk Vampire #2
#2 Your host
What's his name
Jesse looks around, trying not to panic
Pale faces, pale eyes stare at her
long, terrible pause
Suddenly -- Marius

Don't know the guy
The Punk Vampires laugh
Jesse desperately tries to cover her terror

#2 There aren't any ancients left
They all turned to dust
That's a myth
Marius is around here somewhere
Jesse again heads for the door
But Punk Vampire #1 has appeared in front of her
She stares at him, terrified
You
you really should meet him
#1 And why is that
Jesse watches the other Punk Vampires slowly begin to close in on her
As she speaks, she slowly edges to the door
Because
because
he's wise, a philosopher
he asks the big questions
Like how are you going to get through eternity
It's easier for us mortals
Life is brief, but for you
She inches toward the door, desperately stalling
Their white faces gleam menacingly as they close in
She struggles to get the words out
mean
what can you really do with immortality besides just slip from one day to the next, trapped in a void of meaninglessness, relieved only by your next victim
How do you not give in to despair and just wither away from boredom, hopelessness
The Punk Vampires pause, staring at her, as her words sink in
The hooded figure leans forward revealing his face
It is Lestat
He stares at Jesse, amazed
Jesse glances desperately at the door
It's just a few feet away now

73   :    (2)                                             73 You know, it's like they say -- the more things change, the more they stay the same
For you that's forever, right
All around her, vampires are turning to look
The Punk Vampires stare at her, eyes narrowing
Jesse is now inches from the door
She can barely breathe
Punk Vampire #1 gazes at her, his confusion suddenly turning to anger
#1 You know, you're really a downer
He bares his fangs
Jesse bolts out the door vampire faces staring after Jesse  Lestat who gazes at her, absolutely entranced
He watches the Punk Vampires head after Jesse

-                                             74 Jesse hurries up the alley
Breaks into a run
But the three Punk Vampires from the bar have somehow gotten outside
They land in front of her, beside her, behind her
Heart racing, she shakes with fear
They close in, smiling
#3 Now this isn't gonna hurt
You might even enjoy it
He runs his hand up and down her body
Jesse starts to shake
She breaks out in a cold sweat
The others grin
He picks her up by the throat
Her legs flail in the air
Suddenly, the two vampires turn and hiss like cats
Jesse hits the flagstones hard with a grunt
She gasps for air, looks up as the vampires are hurled out of the alley by an invisible force
Jesse alone, turns, still woozy
Finds herself staring at
Lestat
Jesse's eyes open wide, entirely stunned
He drinks her in with his eyes, marking the soft paleness of her skin, her long, red hair, the flush on her cheeks, her pulsing jugular

They gaze at each other, the air suddenly electric
You saved me
Perhaps
So you know Marius
Jesse notices her rucksack cast aside by the Punk Vampires -- Lestat's journal sticks out
She glances at Lestat
He mustn't see it
She steps away, tries to distract him
know a lot of things
He gazes at her
Moves closer, breathing her in, making her flustered
He smiles
Not how to stay alive apparently
Well  guess we've got that in common
Although  think 'm a little ahead in the race here
(a beat, surprised at her brazenness) Well,  can fix that
He circles her
Jesse is shaking, terrified
Enjoying the game, Lestat smiles, moves closer
But Jesse suddenly blurts out
'Mine eyes dazzle, she died so young
' It's about the girl with the violin, isn't it
That stops Lestat
He gazes at Jesse, surprised
Recovers his composure
Stares at her intensely, regarding her anew
Is it
And what else do you think you know
() 49

(staring into her eyes, probing) Am
Tell me all about it
You're
you're both artists
He's a painter
You're a singer
As she speaks, Lestat guides Jesse over to a pile of crates
She stares at some beer bottles shattered on the top of one
He guides her hand downward, closer to the shattered glass
Is that so
What  do is art, is it
Yes
From nothing
you try to create
something beautiful
(shaking now as her hand gets closer and closer) out of the
the cold, dark wasteland of eternity
He stares at her, the words oddly familiar, then scrapes her finger along the bits of broken glass, gravel
She gasps with pain
Lestat gazes at the drops of blood that appear, glistening on Jesse's finger
(softly) Something beautiful
(quickly) But
but Marius isn't a rebel
You're different in that way
You don't want to hide, follow the laws, concealed in the shadows like some insect
You
you still want to walk with the living, don't you, Lestat

74   :    (3)                                                   74 He stares into her eyes, slowly brings her bleeding finger toward his mouth
Well, 'm not hiding now, am
As her bleeding thumb gets closer and closer to his mouth
No, but the only time you're not really alone is when you kill
But, Lestat, you can't help it
it's not your fault
He made you this way
(with her blood on his lips, shakes his head) Ah
Poor, poor me
As he brings her finger closer and closer to his mouth
Their eyes bore into each other, he stares at her rosy cheeks, the cold sweat on her forehead, taking in her remarkable, if foolhardy daring
Her eyes gazing straight into his
He brings her bleeding finger into his mouth
She may swoon
Lestat's eyes burn as he tastes her for mortality, her fragility a brief second, listening to her blood
there's something there that surprises him as he gazes at this mortal girl
He feels something
Desire
Then her blood speaks to him as Lestat's eyes fall on her rucksack
He sees the journal
It all falls into place
Lestat's lip curls in anger
He shoves Jesse away
Wipes his mouth
The mood suddenly changes
Well, Talamascan, you're certainly a very clever librarian, aren't you
She stares at him, found out
He turns from her, laughing, but not the kind of laugh to make Jesse think all's well
() 51
74   :    (4)                                               74 (shaking his head) How sad, you people always trying to know the unknowable
So, was it a good read
My diary
Jesse slowly nods, admitting to all
He shakes his head
Talamasca's been following me for years
've never known one to be so brave
Or is it just foolish
'm only an apprentice
He waves her off, dismissive
Go
'm through with you
Your kind never satisfies my thirst
He turns, walks away
Jesse lets out a sigh of relief, then stares after him
She hesitates, then suddenly calls out: Does anything, Lestat
pause in his gait
But he keeps walking away
Jesse hesitates again, but still calls out
mean, what's the point of coming into the light if not to have someone really know you
But he keeps going
She takes one last chance -- You want the world to see you're real, don't you, Lestat
Don't you
Well, here  am
Suddenly Lestat spins
Stares at the fragile mortal girl risking everything
Flash
Jesse gasps
He now stands right before her
He grabs her, pulls her to him close, tight, hard
He could just snap her neck and be done with it

74   :    (5)                                                74 You better just stick to your books, Talamascan
'Cause you have it all wrong
love all this
delight in it
The dark, dreary world  went to sleep in has burnt itself out and been replaced by the 20th Century -- can you imagine my joy at waking up to discover such a world
It has outdistanced my wildest dreams of it
scream of good and evil, and mortals stand and cheer
adore being back in action
every moment, every single drop of it
Now consider yourself exceedingly lucky and go
He pushes her away
She gasps, humbled by his physical power
She retrieves her rucksack
Starts away
As she reaches the end of the alley, she pauses, takes a breath, turns back, daring everything
Lestat
He turns back, stares at her, astonished
There's something you left out of your diary
(amazed) What
(stares right into his eyes) You kept her violin, didn't you
beat, then Lestat shakes his head, laughs at the absurdity of what she's saying
But Jesse is undaunted
Hey, it's okay
understand
(softly) After all, it's only human

74   :    (6)                                              74 That stops him
Their eyes bore into each other again
Electric
Then Lestat hisses at her, the inhuman sound filling the alley
Lestat lunges, fangs bared
Jesse screams
Turns
Runs
Finds herself -- - In the midst of traffic on a busy street
People walking by
Jesus Christ
She stands there a moment, happy, amazed to be alive
Then it sinks in
She realizes -- Lestat let her go
She glances back at the alley, but Lestat is gone
She brings her finger to her mouth, slowly sticks it in, tastes her own blood, shivers with fear -- and something else -- desire
What she doesn't see is
Lestat in the shadows, silently watching her
He gazes at her youth, her bright eyes, her daring, her mortal passion
She has affected him
He watches as she turns and runs away

Behind him, Lestat's dressing room stretches off into the distance, rows of beautiful suits made from the finest wools and silks
The gradation of colors is spectacular
Peering out at the near-dawn light, a look of loneliness clouds his face
He crosses to the closet
Opens a panel to reveal a safe
Stares at it a moment
Punches in the code
It swings open to reveal something wrapped carefully in black velvet
Lestat unwraps it delicately
It's the ancient violin
(softly) Clever, clever librarian
He quickly puts the violin back, closes the safe door
He shakes his head, tries to laugh it off
But a shadow remains on his face
Lestat hears a gasp

No, Roger, you wouldn't have
So this house is fine  assume
To your liking

Circling the couches, he just smiles

#1 We've got the munchies
You got any food
Vampires don't eat
food
The girls laugh nervously
Lestat laughs dangerously

She opens her legs provocatively
Pacing across the room, he stands before the girls
He curls his finger around the first groupie's hair when a shadow crosses his face
Mine eyes dazzle, she died so young
#1 Huh
It's a very old poem of mine
Losing enthusiasm, Lestat walks away and drops himself onto a couch
With a clap of his hands, the  switches He silently watches one of his video clips

Don't do that

The Second Groupie giggles as well

Hey, can you take both us, Lestat
What'd'ya think
And at once they both start after Lestat on all fours to tickle him
He gazes at them, torn, then laughs at the sight and gets down on
All fours as well as he leads them around the room in a childish game

Let's see
They try to tickle him but he stays just a few feet ahead of them the whole time
The girls giggle as they pursue
Lestat crawling just   ahead of them across the floor and
Up the wall
The teenagers keep giggling as they watch him ascend the   wall like a spider
They can't believe what they're   seeing as
Lestat reaches the wall's top and now crawls upside-down across the ceiling
The girls begin to giggle and half-cry
as they arch their necks all the way back to see
Lestat crawling down the opposite wall

His playing picks up speed, the bow bending across the strings with a maestro's speed and precision
(
) Yes, Marius was impressed with my thirst for knowledge
But it turned out that there was such a thing as knowing too much
There were things Marius was not yet ready to teach me
and Marius and  parted ways
Suddenly, the bow flies out of his hand and slides across the floor, jamming itself under an old bookcase
Lestat comes out of his spell, walks across the room to the bookcase, bends down to cleave the bow out from under it
Having difficulty, he pushes back an old rug on the floor when he sees something
Carved into one of the floorboards is an Egyptian eye with a hole dug out of its iris
Stepping aside, he realizes he is standing on a manhole
beat  Lestat as he thinks
Poking his finger through the hole of the Egyptian eye, he lifts the manhole to reveal a steep set of steps leading down into the villa's basement

He tests the stones ahead of him with caution
Suddenly, the sconces along the passageway come to life
In quick succession, they flare up and burn with an unnatural intensity
Lestat, struck with curiosity and wonder, puts down his candelabra and ventures forth
We  Lestat as he rounds the corner and stops
There is an open foyer area leading to two great wooden doors, held firm by a tree-sized carved wooden bolt that bars the doors shut from the outside
Suddenly, the  flies up and  with a The doors fly open revealing a bright light from within
Lestat, apprehensive, continues towards the open doorway

-                              86 Lestat enters, squinting through the bright light from scores of burning sconces
At the far end of the sanctuary Lestat makes out the shape of two statues, an Egyptian man and an Egyptian woman sitting stone still, seemingly staring straight at him,  and her King,
We recognize Akasha from the sketches in Talbot's office
Stepping closer, they appear not to be statues at all but rather alabaster humans with the palest skin imaginable
His eyes widen at the sight of their clothes -- the most valuable Egyptian finery; bracelets of gold, headdresses of incredible gems, clothes of silk
Staring up into their faces, Lestat is struck with the realization
They're
alive
Lestat is drawn to the woman -- her form and beauty is exquisite even in its absolute stillness
As if this statue had just asked him to play, Lestat holds out his violin
Would you like me to play for you

He raises his violin and begins to play
The song of the   around the walls
Lestat plays, with increasing abandon
Akasha and Enkil sit frozen
Lestat plays and plays, lost in the music
He throws a glance up at the throne and stops
Akasha is moving
Slowly, her eyelids pull back to reveal pale green eyes
Lestat stares in amazement
Her arm rises up, her wrist extended outward towards Lestat
The pulse of a begins
Lestat moves toward her as if beckoned
green vein appears beneath the marble surface of her skin
The vein pulses as the blood courses around

The sound fills Lestat's head as he is drawn closer to Akasha's wrist
Lowering himself, as if genuflecting, Lestat bends closer to the vein which looks like the very font of life to him

At the foot of the bed stands Marius
(quietly) Lestat
The young vampire's eyes bulge open in the grip of some incredible sensation, smiling the most wicked of smiles
Lestat's chest heaves upward, pulling his body with it, only to be jerked back by the manacles that hold him to the bed
More
don't think so, my little lord
Lestat writhes with a physical delight that is almost painful
Lestat realizes he is shackled to the bed with manacles and chains
Struggles against them

Seen the oldest of things -- far too much for one as young as you
You've been unconscious for days

Akasha, the Queen of all who are damned

Lestat struggles with all his might
One of his manacles splits, releasing a leg

Lestat stares up at him
Akasha and her King nearly drank this earth dry when they ruled over Egypt
They drank until they lost their will to drink
They became living statues
And yet Akasha still sustains the life force of all vampires
It is believed what happens to her, happens to all of us
Lestat gazes up at him, taking it in

She has no respect for anything except the taste of blood
Immortal and human alike
Lestat roars and struggles against his manacles
You'll not stop me
Marius stares at him, shocked

In all the years 've cared for them, not once have they moved
Until tonight
And she chose me
Me
Never you
You'll not stop me
Marius moves at super-speed, grabs Lestat by the neck, and pins him down
You are part of a great coven
You take responsibility for your kind

Lestat, lost, looks at Marius, his eyes intoxicated with Akasha's blood
Marius steps back
Looks at his fledgling with great sadness, anger, disappointment

He stretches, shakes his head, as if clearing his head, but something causes him to stop
Something has changed

Some of his paintings remain, but his easel and paint boxes are removed, leaving splattered outlines on the faded marble floor

No
We will contact the covens
Let them know we condone the slaying
It will be better for all to see
Marius, with a tortured expression, gazes at Mael
Maharet steps up
Wait
Never mind Lestat
We have greater problems
(stepping up) Maharet is right
It is Akasha we face now
(joyous) Is it true, Maharet
Has our Queen really risen
Don't be so happy, Pandora knew Akasha when she walked this earth
was her slave
am now her enemy
know what she is capable of

126   :    (2)                                            126 Yes
We've all felt her presence, even as she hides from us
(as others nod, acknowledging the truth of this) What does she want now
She knows only one thing
Taking pleasure in destroying life
She is already killing the young ones to build her strength
She's sucked the life out of her King like a praying mantis sense she is getting closer
She has come to destroy Lestat, but he will only whet her thirst more
The Ancients look to each other, taking this in
Pandora looks around, suddenly nervous
If we act together, we have a chance to destroy her
They all gaze at Maharet, astonished
Yes
We must destroy her immediately
If she is not stopped, 'm afraid of what will happen to the entire mortal world
But can she be destroyed
am left to bear the scars of the last attempt on her life
She was dragged into the sun
She survived
But we almost didn't
Removing his hood, we see his terribly-burned face
They all stare at him
What happens to our Queen happens to us
If Akasha dies, we die as well

126   :    (3)                                              126 Then so be it
We must take that chance
She gazes at them all intensely, as the meaning of her words sink in
We must destroy Akasha
For the sake of humanity
We must find her
Now
But perhaps she has come to kill Lestat and then will go back to her slumber
That is our only hope
(eager) Yes
That's right
She and the covens will take care of that brat
We must go to the concert and pay our respects to our great Queen
How
With your own throat
You've all been asleep too long
You're still dreaming
Marius steps up beside Maharet
Maharet speaks the truth
It is our only hope
Marius then goes and stands beside Maharet and Khayman
The others gaze at the three standing together now
No
Armand is right
We will go to the concert and first see what she does
There may be no need for action
Pandora and Armand nod their assent
The two groups face each other
Maharet gazes at their faces, spits out the words
() 81
126   :    (4)                                             126 Then you go to the concert and you shall see
(shakes her head) And  thought the Ancients became wise with their years
As we   the Ancient Ones, ' creeps back in over
Marius gazes again down at Lestat's house, anguish on his face
-    - cruising the Hollywood streets, wearing sunglasses, hat
He sees something
' Goth girl on the street in front of a record store
He sighs, pulls over
Gets out
- Behind him now we see a cab pull over
It's Jesse, trailing Roger
She gazes at him intently
' Roger's back is  us as he talks to a Goth girl in a whisper
Jesse pays the driver
Gets out
Gazes at Roger
127
'  ( ) -   -       127 , intense  as the band rehearses
Lestat creates a fantastic melody around the beat
He lets the note trail off, eyes closed, smiling, the still  in the room
Lestat hears something, turns
Outside, in the Hollywood Hills, are  across the canyons like wolves
Lestat crosses to the huge glass doors, goes outside
82
128
-                                 128 Lestat stares out at the ominous night
As Maudy and the band continue to play, the wolflike  in the night get
And beneath it all, a
The song comes to an end
Lestat turns, gazes back at the band  the window, at their excitement
He comes back inside
129
-                                 129 Roger now stands there, a nervous look on his face
The
girls you asked for, Lestat
They're here, in the guest wing
Ah
Yes
Lestat gazes in that direction, pensive
was uh
just gonna go catch a movie at the Chinese
don't suppose you'd all want to
Lestat smiles at the clumsy attempt to protect the girls
No, thank you, Roger
We'll entertain ourselves
As Roger leads Lestat to the guest room, he can hear Lestat turns back to the night
The of Akasha still  in his ears
130
-                                   130 Roger and Lestat walk in
young  giggles nervously
#3 Oh my God, it's him
It's really him
She turns in paroxysm of excitement to the girl next to her
Lestat stares, taken aback
It is Jesse
Dressed in Goth gear
Jesse stares back at Lestat brazenly long moment
Perhaps you would like a tour of the place
first
() 83
130   :                                                    130 #3 Oh yeah, wow, we'd love that
Roger
would you be so kind
(surprised, relieved) Sure
Right this way, girls
As they start off, Lestat puts up his hand, points to Jesse
Roger
Not that one
Leave her to me
The other groupie pouts, disappointed
She goes out with Roger
Lestat turns to Jesse
considers her
You must be very keen to die
Jesse's heart pounds with terror
The Talamascans have become quite stealthy
didn't know infiltration was quite their style
It's not
came on my own
He stares at her, taking her in
How did you find me
've been tracking your manager for days
(gesturing to her Goth outfit) Then  figured out you simply have to look the part
Clever librarian
You should know, based on all your research, that groupies don't ever find their way out of here again
() 84
130   :    (2)                                              130 'm not a groupie
Lestat gazes at Jesse's pulsing jugular
He steps closer
Then why are you following me
What do you want
(terrified, in a whisper) Are you granting wishes
(smiles, in a whisper playing    with her) Last wishes
What's yours
Show me what it's like to be you
That's my last wish
Grant it, Lestat
He stares at her, feeling some connection with this strange mortal girl
She stares at him with penetrating eyes
He again finds himself drawn to her
Tries to fight it
(turning away) don't have time for this
All a vampire has is time
Maybe not
(softly) Right
The covens are coming for you
(softly) understand why you're doing it
You have to be who you are, no matter what happens
He turns, gazes at her
She steps forward
() 85
130   :    (3)                                             130 But how are you spending what may be your last night on Earth, Lestat
As you always have
Alone
Jesse takes a breath, crosses to him, stands very close, stares up into his eyes
He stares down at her, amazed, his heart pounding
He breathes in her hair, the scent of her skin
Don't kill me yet
Let's spend our last nights together
Share it with me
Show me what it's like to be you
You don't know what you're asking
don't know what's in that librarian's head of yours, but it's not what you think
That's right
You don't know what's in my head, Lestat
Do you want to
'll know when  kill you
Gee, Lestat, that's a great way to get to know someone
Here
'll give you a preview
Coming attractions
This is what you'll find
She crosses to him, stands close
have this recurring dream that 'm a child and 'm living in this big house filled with vampires
And every night when go to sleep,  wish to God the same thing
you know what that is, Lestat
He gazes at her
She leans forward
() 86
130   :    (4)                                             130 That  will have the dream again
Because in the dream 'm happy
And the dream is more real than my life
don't know how, but know you, Lestat
My life is a big mystery and you, you have the answer
He gazes at her, being taken in, tries to resist it
Jesse moves even closer
He stares down at her, the softness of her skin, her penetrating gaze, the heat of her body
can't go on pretending this life of mine is real
can't live a lie
'm just like you Lestat
We're the same
(softly) Are we
seek the light
You seek the shadows
No
We're looking for exactly the same thing
You know it
Please
Show me
He stares at her
Her eyes gazing directly into his
Suddenly
Alright
Jesse breaks into a smile
This may be painful for a mortal
You're still attached to your skin
(an excited whisper) don't care
Close your eyes
Don't breathe
Her heart pounding, fluttering her eyes closed, Jesse holds one deep, hesitant breath and
Flash -- with preternatural speed -- 87
131                                                    131 whisk through the night, flashing past trees and houses
Opening her eyes for a moment, Jesse watches the world whiz past her at incredible speed and suddenly -- they stop on a dime
Jesse gasps, catching her breath to find herself at Hollywood's highest peak overlooking the city laying out before her like a glimmering blanket
132
-                          132 Looking out over the observatory's ledge, Jesse can't believe what's just happened
She laughs, intoxicated by the experience
Do that again
Lestat laughs, impressed by her bravado
Her trust
For a moment she laughs like a child
Then they look at each other deeply, feeling something
He wants to kiss her
She knows it
He turns away
And now for my next trick
Lestat pulls out a knife, quickly slices his arm open
Jesse gazes at his blood dripping down his arm, something stirring in her
Magically, the wound heals up
She stares, impressed
Did it hurt
Yes
For just a moment
But as the pain is more intense for us, so is ecstacy
(gazes at her) You see, we love our victims
Love
thought it was the blood
No, although the taste is so rich and sweet
Love is the essence of the dark gift
The connection is so much more satisfying, brief as it is, than anything else
() 88
132   :                                                          132 Lestat again becomes aware of Jesse's pulsing jugular, the white flesh of her neck
He reaches out, touches her neck, strokes it
Jesse shivers under his touch, terrified, but wanting more
Lestat brushes his lips against her hair, her neck
Runs his hands down her arms
She closes her eyes, lost in the gentle rhythm of his voice
As you drink, you feel the heart weakening
it struggles even though there's no hope
You feel the life slipping away, the flash of those brief years
The taste of mortality you can no longer experience
and it is beautiful
(pulls away sharply) No 'relationship,' no commingling can ever reach the heights of that experience
But Jesse steps forward
Lestat turns, stares at her
Her eyes burn with an urge that will not be silenced
One button at a time, her fingers quivering, she opens her blouse down to her navel
Lestat stares as Jesse removes a long, silver hairpin from the mane of her red locks which then cascade about her shoulders
Her face remains aimed unwavering at Lestat's as she brings the hairpin down to her breast
With her eyes moored to his, she draws a line with the point across her breast
She inhales through clenched teeth
then settles as we see: The long incision go from pink to red; then the blood, like a hot spring pouring over the brim and dripping down her chest
Lestat staggers
Breaking their stare, he accepts her gift, lapping up the overspill and then onto the wound itself
Lestat closes her eyes
He comes up to her face, brushing his lips against her cheek
She shivers
(groans) Your blood
(murmurs) Do you like it
() 89
132   :    (2)                                              132 (losing himself) Yes
He comes down to her slender neck
Stares at the soft, pulsing skin
He bares his fangs
(whispering, overcome) Do it to me
Please
With your blood 'll know you
133                                                     133 He can't help himself
He moves to Jesse's white neck
closer
closer
'll know everything
But suddenly her words catch him
His head flails as he tries to stop his natural impulse
Lestat lets out a desperate cry and throws her aside
Jesse gazes at him, surprised
He looms over her, angry
You want to know everything
You want to see what it's like
Then come
'll show you
134
-                                      134 Lestat and Jesse quietly move among the trees
Lestat stops on a dime -- senses tuned
He looks into the dark
Jesse is about to speak when Lestat raises his finger to her lips and then points at
couple of lovers moving across the meadow
They sit on a park bench
The woman giggles drunkenly
Jesse watches and gasps as she realizes the male lover is a vampire
Lestat moves forward
Jesse gingerly follows
Taking his lover in his arms the vampire begins to bite her neck
Lestat looks over at Jesse who watches, fascinated and disturbed
The vampire senses another's presence -- stops and turns to reveal his vampire eyes shining in the dark
Lestat steps into the halo of a street lamp and hisses
Sensing Lestat's power, the vampire hisses and instantly -- the vampire is gone
Jesse turns to Lestat but he has disappeared, too
Spinning around again she sees
Lestat hovering over the mortal woman who is still in a swoon
Checking to see that the vampire is gone, Jesse moves closer to the bench
() 90
134   :                                                    134 Is she alright
Lestat looks up to face her, revealing his blood-stained lips
Jesse reflexively looks away
Come closer, Jesse
You want to see
You want to know
Lestat, no
Lestat's expression turns cold as ice -- he arches his back like a great cat and goes in for the kill
The woman's body convulses
Jesse watches in horror as
the woman's hands clutch at Lestat, her back stiffens
finally her legs relax in an obscene parody of orgasm
Jesse gasps, backs away
Lestat finishes and, wiping his mouth, approaches Jesse
You see now
Are you ready
Now do you want it
He gazes into her eyes, finding himself desperately wanting her to say yes
The horror, the revulsion in Jesse's face says it all
No
Of course you don't
She backs away from him, now terrified
Something's changed in his eyes
They are cold, blank
Well  didn't grant your final wish
(shakes his head) It was an impossible wish to begin with
You see,  am unknowable
His eyes still as death, he starts moving away
Lestat
Wait
Lestat turns toward her suddenly, grabs her forcefully, pulls her into his arms, gazes into her eyes
Good-bye, Talamascan

134   :    (2)                                             134 Jesse closes her eyes in terror, knowing her life is about to be over
Then Jesse reaches for her mouth as if she were touched by something when
the  of Lestat's lips kissing her lips flashes by in   as
Jesse's face is completely still in
As her hand drops, she realizes what just happened
And with that, Lestat disappears
She stares into the night
There's a and the sound of
Jesse turns, screams, backs away
It's not Lestat standing there at all but Mael, the Druid vampire
With great speed he glides towards her, envelops Jesse in his cloak, muffling her cries

We   rows and rows of dolls from different eras
the billowing floor-to- ceiling curtains to reveal Jesse -- still an adult, but lying awake in bed just as she had as a little girl
Jesse gets out of bed, trapped in her own childhood memory
Is she dreaming now

She sees a door at the end of the hall
Walking a little faster now, she draws toward it as

141 Jesse as a little girl, wanders down a similar hall toward what sounds like a
Reaching the thick wooden door she peeps through to see
142      ()                                        142 Jesse stares up at an enormous mural dominating the far wall -- a mural of names, a family tree -- extending up onto the ceiling and down to the floor
143    -                                               143 Jesse, as a little girl, walking beside Maharet, looks up at the mural
(furious) Why can't  stay with you
Please, Auntie Maharet
don't want you to go, but you must
tear of blood trickles down Maharet's cheek
Auntie, you're bleeding
Jesse takes the tear and goes to put it to her mouth but Maharet violently grabs her hand
Young Jesse is frightened
You must be with your own, my sweetest girl
'll always be watching over you
want to stay with you forever

Again the voice, but much gentler
Forever is a very long time
Jesse looks up out of her memory to see in the doorway down the end of the hall

Aunt Maharet
Jesse rushes to her
Stops
Stares at her aunt's glowing eyes, the strange pallor of her skin
You're a
Yes
Oh, Jesse, 've missed you so much, but  had to keep this from you
Jesse stands there, soaking it in
Maharet takes her hands gently
Oh my God, this is why
knew was different

Jesse follows Maharet to the mural of the family tree
You are the most precious of my great family
Am

You are not

My sister died before her child was one year old

You are my most prized light
You are what keeps me connected to the world of the living
Jesse stares at Maharet, amazed
When your parents died  took you to India to take care of you
And something happened there
stopped it from happening
And will again
Maharet stands close, gazes at her
Jesse, you must stay away from Lestat
You must forget all about him
Jesse looks at her, surprised
Maharet smiles
Yes,  know about your new friend
You think you love him, but it's not as you thought it would be
Jesse stares at Maharet, surprised she understands so well
thought  was like him
know, but it is not who you are, not who you are meant to be
You have found that out now
Jesse sits on a stone bench, confused
Maharet smiles sadly, feeling Jesse's inner turmoil
Lestat's all  can think about
felt like  belonged with him
Now  know why

Jesse, you must forget about him
You must trust me
(gazes up at her a long moment) missed you so much, Aunt Maharet
Me too
Just then the gloom of the pre-dawn's light begins to illuminate the windows of the great hall
You will go home to London in the morning
Jesse holds Maharet's eyes
But this is my home
This is where  belong
Why do you want to get rid of me so quickly
Maharet touches her face gently
Now is not the time to be here
The light is getting brighter
Maharet stands
You were seeking answers
Now you have found them
The family is who you are
Maharet goes to Jesse, wraps her arms tight around Jesse
Despite the coldness of her skin, Jesse warms to the embrace, closes her eyes, holds her tight
Then, beaten by the sun, Maharet stands, exits into the shadows, turns back to Jesse, gazes at her
You will go home to London tomorrow

a long mournful note
He stops a moment, lost in his thoughts
flash of the first morning light reflects off the ancient wood
Lestat puts the violin away tear of blood trickles down his cheek
His face is filled with sadness at what will never be
word escapes from his lips

Lestat draws the curtains and enters his sanctum where his coffin sits in the safety of darkness

She pauses at one of Maharet
As Jesse shifts, the glass over the painting catches Jesse's reflection
Jesse moves slowly until her face just covers Maharet's
In the reflection, Jesse's eyes now glow with Maharet's luminescence
Jesse stares a long, long moment
148
-                                        148 Jesse sits at a desk, writing a note, torment, confusion on her face

) Dear Aunt Maharet, my whole life, 've felt
kind of crazy guess, different from everyone, and now  know why
You say now know who  am meant to be
have found my answers
You are right

Nothing for as far as the eye can see

know that now
love you, Aunt Maharet
Good-bye
Jesse walks away from the house
Coming to a highway, she reads a sign -- "  120 miles
" Just then, a  minibus barrels down the road in Jesse's direction
She sticks out her thumb
The minibus pulls to a stop on the shoulder in a cloud of dust leans out the window -- not a real vampire, just a kid with white face-paint and fake fangs
Need a ride
Jesse peers past the driver to a crowd of Goths and fake vampires
the
(smiles) Yeah

Until we are   an incredible scene

But she has disappeared
Talbot is jostled, dropping his glasses on the ground
(
) Sorry, Grandpa
Talbot crouches down and finds his glasses
Reemerging, he senses something and looks up

155                                                          155 Speechless
must show you my new paintings sometime
Marius smiles
Talbot is awestruck -- the goal of a lifetime's searching
He tries to say something, but it's too late
Flash
Marius is moving through the crowd at unnatural speed
Enormous pipes spout flames high into the sky, run like a corridor of red light along the crowd, leading to two enormous Egyptian effigies of Akasha and Enkil flanking a stage at the top end
And before the stage stretches a mass of human bacchanalian debauchery
Woodstock on mescaline
Naked bodies, pierced and tattooed, mingle with the strangest of fashions as crowds gather in circles around their own lit fires, drumming out awesome rhythms
The whole place is an enormous flaming mosh pit   -- naked bodies walk across heads of people while others   get tossed and thrown
This crowd is determined to    get what they were promised
Nothing like they've   ever seen

And among the mortals are the immortals
Amidst them we see the tattooed Vampires, the Armani Vampire, the others, now dressed in cloaks which they use to hide their knives and sickles
156                                                156 Standing on the strange rocks are the Ancient vampires, except for Maharet
Some of whom can't help but smile at the scene below
Marius is now with them
(wistful, to Mael) It's just like Nero's day
They scan the horizon, the darkening sky
Akasha will not be able to resist this

Roger still worrying and sweating
James, Alex and Maudy sit in their own circle, jamming with their unplugged instruments, psyching themselves up for the biggest night of their lives

' - -                            158 Lestat stretches out with his eyes closed as the sounds of the  crowd begin to make the whole van shudder
Roger pops his head in
They're getting pretty worked up out there
159
-                                       159 Lestat emerges from his honey-wagon, splendid in his concert costume
He looks ready for business, whatever may happen
The band look at each other, then look to Lestat
This is the moment
He smiles like a father at them

Suddenly the torches go out sending the place into utter darkness
stunned moment
The place goes berserk
We see the dim figures of the band take their places
Jesse desperately tries to push toward the front

The mass surges forward
The stage lights up in a huge halo of blood-red light
The band plays a hypnotic tune that would put the devil in a spell, as
We wait for Lestat
The band keeps playing the pounding cadence, as
The audience doesn't see Lestat anywhere and cheers over the sound, and it seems as if the whole of Death Valley is shaking, when
Lestat appears above the stage, inhumanly levitating and
'm so glad  decided to rise
(shouting) After tonight, Death Valley will live up to its name

164   :                                                   164 The place erupts into one solid scream as the band kicks it in
He swoops down through the air over the stage and into their very midst
Jesse, in the crowd, screams up to him
But her voice is lost in the thousands of screams for him
Lestat takes the microphone and leans his lips into it, letting his voice soar into an inhuman note, filling the valley like a demon demanding heaven be replaced with hell
165       -                              165 Two   sit dazed

The second Engineer looks to the mixing panel
#2 His mic's not even up
They stare, dumbfounded
166                                                   166 The pulsing strain moves into a faster beat as the whole place resonates with the most incredible harmonics, the energy throbbing, the crowd almost genuflecting in front of this papal devil
All move and sway except for
Jesse, desperately squeezing through bodies trying to get closer and closer to
Lestat, who commands the place with his echoing voice
Lestat holds the place in the palm of his hand
Lestat's dark soul seems ready to burst as he moves his voice into an even higher unworldly octave, and then
167   '                                                  167 The vampires move through the crowd
Goth girls in the front row, weeping
Maudy, James and Alex off in the clouds, playing the best music of their lives
The place has gone wild, living off its own energy now as waves of sound bounce through the valley band up into the night sky

The crowd screams
Yes
This one's for those who've come for me
All yell that they have, but the covens know it's for them
Lestat launches the band into a new number that makes the previous song seem like a lullaby
He eyes the coven-assassins here and there and sings straight to them
His lyrics challenging the assassins, flaunting them with satire
Jesse whirls around, spying the assassins in the crowd
She shakes her head no
The covens need no more encouragement as they begin to move through the crowd toward the stage
We the crowd to see fifty assassins snaking at preternatural speed, unseen to all except us in our inhuman vantage
: 169    -                                                  169 Marius spies the covens slipping through the crowd at a strange velocity
He looks to Lestat, worried

Reaching   the stage, they are suddenly on it -- roadies run   in and are immediately cast aside by inhuman powers
We speed into vampire time as
(: In camera,    no
) The assassins draw knives and lunge, determined to dismember Lestat
Lestat does an acrobatic leap, dodging the knives
He rips the microphone from the stand and holds it up just in time
as an assassin is impaled
The assassin squirms and convulses
The crowd goes insane
Lestat snarls at the audience as if this really were part of the performance
The assassins attack again, this time hurtling massive light stands like they were small spears
Lestat dodges them
The assassins   , lunge with the deadly shards

He flies over equipment and roadies, up into the air
The Ancients gaze after him and

Back to mortal time
The crowd cheers at the sudden appearance of the figure on stage, loving the show
Lestat grins at Marius
The band keeps playing
Marius hurls a huge at the assassins
It  as it hits them, pinning one with shards
But an assassin hurls a sickle at Lestat
Lestat is struck down, his singing stopped
The assassins move in

Lestat raises his arms for the crowd
The crowd jeers
Lestat looks to Maudy and the band
Get out of here
The band scampers off stage as the assassins fly past, the reverb from their guitars whistle into a deafening pitch

But one after the other they spontaneously combust, turning hot-white to black ash and drift up into the air like strange supernatural kites
The crowd hollers and screams, not quite believing what they saw or how it was done, when
Down in the throng, vampires also begin to combust -- hot flashes of white exploding through the crowd, turning into black paper dolls -- wafting up over the valley -- crumbling into fluttering puffs of soot
Panic takes over the mass of people, running in all directions
Jesse remains pinned to her spot
175                                                          175 stands in wonder as Marius stares up into the high darkness
(soft, to himself) Akasha
The valley fills with hundreds of burning "kites" floating like black ghosts
Khayman, Pandora and Armand gaze up at the sky
She is here

She pushes toward the stage against the tide of bodies fleeing

Jesse, now almost to the stage, screams to him

Suddenly the wooden platform beneath Lestat begins to buckle under his feet
Fragments of   upwards around Lestat
Marius loses his balance and staggers backwards
Fragments of sharp wood fly into the audience
Jesse raises her hands to protect herself
She looks up
Freezes
Akasha rises up through the stage
Beautiful and terrifying
She grabs Lestat and the two of them shoot up into the air
The crowd stares in awe
Jesse is frozen
Roger, the Fire Marshal, the band, everyone is frozen
Talbot stares up at Akasha, his face white, unable to believe his eyes
Even the Ancient Ones are stunned to see their Queen come to life

Akasha and Lestat vanish

Lestat is awestruck
Akasha comes to life
Akasha
Akasha still says nothing -- she advances with a luscious, curling smile
Why so surprised, my love
You called, and  have come
Lestat is awestruck
There is such an unearthly power in Akasha's voice
Everything seems to hum and vibrate with her breath
Never fear me, Lestat
Your wishes have all come true
My wishes
You have yearned for a companion to share eternity
You have cried out to the world
have answered your call
Akasha spreads her arms, moving ever closer to Lestat
You are so bold, like your music
It woke me
You live your life in the open, like  did long ago, when  had a King
Had a King
He's no more
You are my consort
've kept you safe -- alive
You

(laughing) You have the ego of a king as well
know you, Lestat
know that you crave to have the world at your feet
have come to give it to you
Akasha bites her own lip
Blood trickles slightly across her chin
Lestat stares at the blood, yearns towards it, as the pulse of her blood increases
Lestat looks at it, both wanting and fearful
Wrapping her arms around Lestat, she braces him, licks his face
Has your tongue lost its taste for blood
(melting) Never
But you didn't kill the mortal girl
Lestat looks caught
Instead you kissed her
Now kiss me
(: Shoot as practical, actor against plain night sky, as much as possible
) Akasha rises above him, hovers over Lestat, letting a single drop of blood spill into his mouth
Lestat levitates above the ground to meet her as
Akasha hovers higher, drawing him into the sky until their mouths finally meet and her blood flows freely into him
Lestat pulls away as a great surge of power gathers in him and floods his body with an electric rush
Be my King
Forget about everything else
Lestat looks straight at Akasha, his face flushed
His eyes are empty of everything except her blood
What's your answer

Akasha's mouth spreads into a smile
Flashes of brilliant light strobe over them as Lestat moves to her, sucks again
There's a powerful rush of  that engulfs them as they spin together, detached from time and space
181     -                                     181 All   Akasha's skin, her body taut and arching
Lestat falls back in ecstasy
He shakes out his body and lets out a howl of pleasure -- feels his arms, his chest, his groin as Akasha's blood courses through his veins
Akasha watches and waits
Finally Lestat grins boyishly through bloody teeth and wipes his lips with the back of his hand
Can we try that again
Akasha smiles at him, then laughs a strange laugh, a kind of purr/growl
Lestat gazes at her as the sensual hissing seems to surround him
It is seductive and scary
Lestat steps up, puts a finger to her lips
Show me the world
Akasha's mouth spreads into a smile and she yanks him up into the air and off into the night

-                           182 Mael leads Jesse down the hall
She stares ahead at what looks like statues standing in the shadows
Her eyes widen as the statues come to life: Armand, Pandora, Khayman, Marius are talking in hushed tones, gathered before Maharet's "Great Family Tree
" the endless lines, the rows of names that stretch down the stone wall --  the floor, filling room after room
The Ancients all stare, deeply moved
Maharet turns to them
We see now what Akasha means to do
Rule as Queen again
(pointing to the great family) This is why we must fight Akasha
Maharet looks around, determined, challenging each of the immortals

She must be stopped, or the mortal world will end
The Ancients fall silent as they take this in
They gaze again at Maharet's Great Family, humbled for a moment by her life's passion
But is there a way
We don't know
When she opens herself to give her blood, she is vulnerable
Then we weaken her
Drain her of almost all her blood, but leave her just one drop
We can't take that chance
We must finish her
If she dies, we all die
We're damned no matter what happens
Perhaps
Maharet gazes at them, her mind working
Pandora, Khayman, Mael gaze at each other, still uncertain
And what about Lestat
Lestat has joined with Akasha
He is lost to us now
He is never coming back
don't believe that

rips through the trees
Everywhere, there are torches, and a million candles light the vast house
Lestat and Akasha glide past the forest of exotic flowers
Past the fountains and statues -- up the steps to the open French doors
Long white curtains billow in the sea wind
Where are we
We are home
You live here
We live everywhere and anywhere we choose
The world is our garden

'   -                          185 Lestat steps in through billowing curtains, stops
There are three West Indian girls, young, voluptuous, beautiful, dressed in simple working clothes and traditional head-wraps
They stare at Lestat, nervous, yet fascinated
They move towards him
Lestat finds himself surrounded by hands, touching him, reaching beneath his shirt, pulling his clothes from his body
He swoons, closes his eyes, smiles

breasts strain through white linen as they press themselves closer to him
the surface of water, scented with red rose petals
Lestat's white skin breaks the surface
Lestat is lowered into the bath, his skin alive with the dancing candles reflected in the water
the water laps gently -- strange sighs of pleasure as girls' hands caress Lestat's torso
their hands reach down lower and lower through the water
Lestat's eyes remain closed but his mouth opens
Now it's Akasha kissing him
Lestat responds, but his eyes sneak a peek
Akasha smiles -- takes his head in her hands -- she kisses him, pushes him back -- he tries to resist -- he can't, startled by her strength
Akasha kisses his neck, his chest, bites
Lestat arches in ecstasy
Akasha rises up from his breast, blood on her lips, smiles, goes back down and drinks
: 187      -                                       187 now moved to the bed, surrounded by the fine nets
kissing, probing each other's bodies, floating above the bed
Akasha rolls him over -- smiles down at him -- a fang exposed
She draws her wrist across her mouth
a globule of blood smacks Lestat's open lips
Flash -- thousand images in a second
Lestat jolted as if by a million volts
Blood smears their bodies -- they bathe in it

He sits up alone in the canopied bed, disoriented
Akasha is nowhere to be seen
He looks toward the window
The sun is just about to disappear below the horizon
Lestat stares, amazed, blinking
Shielding his eyes, Lestat goes to window, gazes in awe at the setting sun
As the last rays slice through the sky, Lestat closes his eyes, stretches his arms out, feels the warm sun on his skin
He smiles at this feeling he's craved for so long
Still smiling, he opens his eyes, blinking from the light
He turns, gazes towards the bath and gasps
The dying light illuminates
The servant girls' bodies, now grey with death, lying around the edge of the bath
The roses are now black and the water is colored a rich deep red

-   -           191 The candles have all melted, forming pools that spread across the lace cloth
Food sits uneaten on plates
The last of the sun's rays strikes ten dead bodies sitting around the table, some slumped onto their food, some frozen in death

Lestat, shielding his eyes, stares up in horror at the pink sky
Behold our Kingdom
Lestat sees Akasha standing further down on the beach
Why

This is the reason you have risen
They believed in nothing, now they are nothing
But you and  will change all that
We will give the world something to believe in again
Akasha smiles, raises her hand, suddenly slices her wrist with a knife
Lestat stares at her dripping blood
She crosses to him, her eyes locked on his
She lifts her wrist, drips her blood into Lestat's mouth
Lestat's eyes glaze over again
He smiles, feeds hungrily, lost again
Akasha smiles
Come, my King
We have a score to settle
The Queen and her King swiftly fly up into the darkness

Unable to help herself
Lestat
He turns slowly to the corner where she sits
They lock eyes
Lestat's face stares cold and hard
What has she done to you
Made me see
Taking his arm, Akasha draws Lestat to her
The Ancient Vampires subtly position themselves under the medieval weapons hanging on the walls, as Marius moves toward his son
Lestat
step aside
Never
She is my Queen
Marius looks for some recognition in Lestat's eyes
There is none
Maharet turns to Akasha
Akasha
The world has changed since you reigned
Then we shall change it back
Humans are animals, brute creatures
Their destruction can only make sense
We've found other ways to co- exist
Yes

For respect of mortals

They are only

Maharet doesn't even flinch
Akasha, please
(venomous) You think you can change my will
'm tired of this discussion
Join me, or die
will not
will not
want to hear it from every one of you
What will it be
Akasha scans the faces of the other Ancient Ones, staring deep into their souls
Akasha sees Khayman glance at the family tree
Akasha's eyes blaze with anger
Don't tell me, you have feelings for these ridiculous mortals
She crosses to the family tree, traces the names down to one
Jessica Reeves
Akasha is beyond fury, yet she keeps her temper under control and turns to Lestat
Do you love me
Smiling, she bites her lip, letting a drop of blood glisten there, tempting Lestat
Yes
He draws closer
Jesse stares, mortified
Akasha and Lestat's mouths almost meet when Akasha pulls away
Akasha slowly turns to Jesse
Prove it
Kill her

193   :    (3)                                               193 She's nothing to me
Just the same, 'd like you to kill her
For me
(to the Ancients) 've had enough of this 'great family
' It's time to end it
Maharet steps between Lestat and Jesse
You will not touch her
Akasha flicks her wrist
Maharet is hurled against a pillar, pinned by Akasha's hand
You still think to challenge me, Maharet
beg you, spare this child
Now
Maharet struggles but Akasha is too strong
Jesse gazes at Lestat
Then steps forward
It's all right, Maharet
Maharet stops, standing fixed with the sound of Jesse's newly strong and calm voice
Jesse looks to Lestat, straight into his dark irises, her gaze absolutely unwavering
It's what  want
am ready
She reaches up, pulls aside her shirt, revealing the top of her breast
thin, red scar remains from where she cut herself with the silver stick from the Chinese barrette
Lestat gazes at her, begins to advance
Jesse keeps her gaze steady into Lestat's, risking everything
(smirking) How sweet

193   :    (4)                                                193 Lestat moves closer and closer to her, gazes into her eyes, hesitates for a moment, then continues on
Jesse watches him with absolute love
He reaches her
Maharet flies across the room, but Akasha meets her halfway
Grabs her by the hair
Maharet struggles but Akasha is much more powerful
Jesse offers up her neck to his bite
Maharet looks away and Akasha looks pleased as
Lestat sinks his teeth into Jesse's neck
Jesse gasps with the bite, but puts her arm around Lestat as he draws her into him, draining her of her very life-force as she holds him
With that Maharet's great family mural begins to weep blood from every name
All the Ancients turn, stare at the mural as
Lestat drinks and drinks and Jesse sighs with intimacy, clutching his neck and back, and drawing his bite deeper into her flesh
She slowly crumples to the floor, being drawn down until finally
Jesse lies on the floor, eyes closed and pale
Dead
Good-bye, great family
She turns to the  with a fierce gaze
Flash
It ,  to a million pieces on the ground
Maharet stares in horror
Now, my children, remember your real family
Or else
She turns to them with a killing smile
But, My Queen, you've forgotten my reward
She turns to him
That's right
My King, you've just earned your crown
Lestat smiles with a blood-stained mouth
Akasha approaches Lestat and offers him her vein
She looks scornfully at the others as he cradles her wrist

193   :    (5)                                                   193 You see how he obeys
You will or you will all die
Lestat looks once at Marius, then sinks his teeth into its original font
He drinks as Akasha gasps with pleasure at giving so much pleasure to him
She keeps smiling to the others
But Lestat doesn't stop drinking
Akasha looks back to him, her face changing
That's enough, Lestat
Still Lestat doesn't stop
Lestat
Enough
Stop
(: Scene as scripted here is quite different from what was analyzed in boards
Notable potential expense or savings indicated with brackets
[]) But Lestat clamps down even harder
Akasha thrashes, trying to release herself
Maharet and Marius realize what he's doing, see the chance Lestat has gained for them
silent signal passes between them as
The Ancients make an instantaneous decision
Akasha looks up, gasping, in time to see Maharet, Marius, Khayman, Armand, Mael, Pandora flying towards her
Akasha lets out a hiss
Most of the Ancients are thrown to the ground while Mael ignites in mid-air
Mael's skin bubbles
He screams, the veins in his face rise up and explode as if his blood were burning acid
Pandora too bursts into flames
She falls to the ground
But Lestat, strong with Akasha's blood, keeps his hold and Khayman, Armand, Marius, Maharet fly at her again
They swarm over Akasha
She rises into the air, thrashing about, but they hang on, forming a flying mass of flailing limbs
The  of Akasha's   as they try to drain her
Akasha turns on [Khayman to incinerate him
Flash
He screams as his blood boils, exploding out of his fingertips -- But he doesn't ignite
His wounds quickly heal
He moves in for another attack

193   :    (6)                                               193 The Ancients are still flung around by Akasha's great strength, but they all hold on, as the thrashing finally begins to subside
The mass of bodies sinks to the ground
The Ancients pull back to reveal that
Akasha's skin is deathly blue white
In horror, she manages to spit out her words
You kill me, you kill yourselves
The Ancient Ones look to each other, uncertain a moment
Akasha gazes at them, then turns slowly, fixes her gaze on Lestat
He gazes back at her
Suddenly, Akasha takes her chance, rises, her eyes flare green, marshalling the last of her wrath
Lestat cries out in agony as smoke rises from his limbs
Fiercely determined, Lestat bites into Akasha's throat, this time for the kill
Akasha sinks her nails into his throat
He hangs on, his teeth deep
They are locked in mortal combat
Akasha slowly sinks to the ground, real fear in her eyes as her strength finally vanishes
Wait, Lestat
You must stop
Lestat pulls away, leaving Akasha hanging in a twisted, unnatural angle
They all stare waiting to see what will happen
Maharet moves quickly
She strides over to Akasha and sinks her fangs into Akasha's neck
Akasha struggles but this time she cannot even rise up
Maharet does not stop
sound as if from hell fills the room
The Ancient Ones stare at Akasha, step back in awe
Lestat sits up, burned but still alive to see
Akasha's skin begins to grow horribly pale, to harden and cake into a chalk
There's no blood left to flow from the gaping holes in Akasha's flesh
She slowly begins to transform back to her frozen statue state
Her skin returning to
multiply, becoming fissures
Finally, Akasha literally falls to pieces,  on the stone floor like porcelain
silent moment
The Ancient Ones look at each other, astonished, as they realize they're still "alive

193   :    (7)                                             193 (whisper) We survived
The Ancients let out relieved hisses
But Lestat is only concerned about Jesse
He rushes to her, picks up her lifeless head, takes a dagger from the floor and slices his wrist
He brings the open vein to Jesse's mouth, but she's not moving
Lestat bends down to her ear and whispers
left you one drop, my love
Drink deep and live
Jesse's lips slightly move and quiver as she tastes the blood
She begins to take the blood inside her and then finally truly drink and revive as Lestat cradles her
She pulls away, gasping
Lestat looks into her eyes
thought 'd lost you
Drink, my love
Her lips move to his wrist
Lestat strokes her hair, soothes her
Jesse gasps as pain courses through her
Lestat holds her close
She looks up at him, their eyes are locked together
will never leave you again
He holds her tight in his arms
All the Ancients gaze at Lestat, now understanding what he did
Slowly Jesse rises, gazes at Lestat, her face pale, her eyes glowing
Then Jesse turns, stares at Maharet
All the Ancients turn, follow her gaze
whiteness is spreading across Maharet's face and skin
Maharet stares at her arms and legs, slowly turning to stone
Jesse goes to her
Maharet

You are finally happy
It is as it should be now
will watch over you always
Maharet reaches out, embraces Jesse
Then Maharet sinks into a chair and freezes into a statue
(a reverent whisper) She took Akasha's last drop, took Akasha's death into herself
Behold, our Queen
our new mother
The Ancients slowly bow to Maharet
Jesse slowly slips from Maharet's arms
Goes into Lestat's arms
Is she
dead
No, she will live forever
She sleeps
She sleeps, and dreams of us
Jesse and Lestat hold onto each other, gazing at Maharet's face
On Maharet's lips is the most content of smiles
Jesse wipes away a tear
Marius turns to Lestat
Their eyes meet
Then Marius bows at Maharet's feet
My Queen,  will watch over you always

He leaps out of his seat
Sees the change in her instantly
Jesse
My God
(smiles) David, this is Lestat
He looks at Lestat, fear in his eyes
How do you do
Charmed, 'm sure

flicker of curiosity crosses David's face
Excuse me for asking but
(smiles) What's it like
Yes
Do you want to find out
Me
No
'm too old to live forever
Well, if you ever should change your mind
Oh
have a present for you
From an old friend
She hands Talbot a canvas
It's a painting
He stares at it
The painting shows Lestat's concert
And in the crowd, Talbot finds Marius, now looking straight out at the viewer, a smile on his lips
Talbot sees standing beside Marius is Talbot himself, dancing with a young, pretty Goth
Talbot smiles
And Marius sent a message
You were right
He doesn't go to the Dorchester
But he's gonna be at Claridge's later
Talbot stares at them
Well,  guess this is good-bye
Yes
Take care of her, Lestat
Always
Talbot looks at Jesse, once his spiritual daughter
Good-bye, Jesse

Good-bye, dear friend

Then stands, grabs his coat, heads for the door

-                                    199 Jesse and Lestat come out of the Talamascan headquarters
He takes her hand and together they float up over the wall and out to the street
Lestat pulls Jesse into his arms
They kiss
It's long, deep, romantic
They pull away, gaze sweetly, lovingly, into each other's eyes
And exchange happy, fanged smiles
Shall we go get a drink, love
She smiles, nods
Lestat and Jesse take each other's hands, move into the crowd, zipping through the streets at that  preternatural
and vanish into the night
