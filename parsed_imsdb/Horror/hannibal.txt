Would he recognize it, think not
,     , ,    - , (cont'd) () Would you care to address that, Dr
Fell
,
, , Cavalcanti replied publicly to Dante's first sonnet
Do you know it, Professor Sogliato
believe it's worth your time:  Listen to the way he makes an instrument of the Italian vernacular, which he called the vulgari eloquentia -- the eloquent voice of the people: Allegro me sembrava amor tenedo/Meo core in mano, e ne la braccia avea/Madonna involta in un drappa dormedo/Poi la svegliava a d'esto ardeno/Lei paventosa umilmente pascea/Appreso gir lo ne vedea paingendo
If Dante had written to a Cavalcanti, it would, of course, have been to Andrea, the most literary of his brothers
