[entering graveyard] Jack's Lament Performed by Danny Elfman There are few who'd deny, at what  do  am the best For my talents are renowned far and wide When it comes to surprises in the moonlit night excel without ever even trying With the slightest little effort of my ghostlike charms have seen grown men give out a shriek With the wave of my hand, and a well-placed moan have swept the very bravest off their feet Yet year after year, it's the same routine And  grow so weary of the sound of screams And , Jack, the Pumpkin King Have grown so tired of the same old thing Oh, somewhere deep inside of these bones An emptiness began to grow There's something out there, far from my home longing that 've never known 'm the master of fright, and a demon of light And 'll scare you right out of your pants To a guy in Kentucky, 'm Mister Unlucky And 'm known throughout England and France And since  am dead,  can take off my head To recite Shakespearean quotations No animal nor man can scream like  can With the fury of my recitations But who here would ever understand That the Pumpkin King with the skeleton grin Would tire of his crown, if they only understood He'd give it all up if he only could Oh, there's an empty place in my bones That calls out for something unknown The fame and praise come year after year Does nothing for these empty tears [leaving graveyard and entering forest] Jack,  know how you feel
[Sally gathers herbs] [back at Dr
Finkelstein's castle] Sally, you've come back
had to
For this
[showing her arm] Yes
Shall we then
That's twice this month you've slipped deadly nightshade into my tea and run off -- Three times
You're mine you know
made you with my own hands
You can make other creations
'm restless,  can't help it
It's a phase my dear, it'll pass
We need to be patient that's all
But,  don't want to be patient
[forest] bark No Zero, not now
'm not in the mood
bark All right
[giving Zero a rib from himself]  Here ya go boy
[Zero gets rib and shows off his nose] [Back to Halloweentown] Morning gents [to the band] [humming This Is Halloween, walks up to Jack's front door and rings bell] Jack, you home

(with worried face) Jack, please, 'm only an elected an official here,  can't make decisions by myself
Jack, answer me
[falls down steps] He's not home
Where is he
He hasn't been home all night
ooooo [back to forest] (yawning)  Where are we
It's someplace new
bark bark What is this
[Jack sees Valentine's tree, shamrock tree, Easter egg tree, turkey tree] [gasps] [sees Xmas tree] [turns knob and gets sucked in] bark bark Whoa
What's This
Performed by Danny Elfman What's this
What's this
There's color everywhere What's this
There's white things in the air What's this
can't believe my eyes must be dreaming Wake up, Jack, this isn't fair What's this
What's this
What's this
There's something very wrong What's this
There's people singing songs What's this
The streets are lined with Little creatures laughing Everybody seems so happy Have  possibly gone daffy
What is this
What's this
There's children throwing snowballs instead of throwing heads They're busy building toys And absolutely no one's dead There's frost on every window Oh,  can't believe my eyes And in my bones  feel the warmth That's coming from inside Oh, look What's this
They're hanging mistletoe, they kiss Why that looks so unique, inspired They're gathering around to hear a story Roasting chestnuts on a fire What's this
What's this
In here they've got a little tree, how queer And who would ever think And why
They're covering it with tiny little things They've got electric lights on strings And there's a smile on everyone So, now, correct me if 'm wrong This looks like fun This looks like fun Oh, could it be  got my wish
What's this
Oh my, what now
The children are asleep But look, there's nothing underneath No ghouls, no witches here to scream and scare them Or ensnare them, only little cozy things Secure inside their dreamland What's this
The monsters are all missing And the nightmares can't be found And in their place there seems to be Good feeling all around Instead of screams,  swear can hear music in the air The smell of cakes and pies Are absolutely everywhere The sights, the sounds They're everywhere and all around 've never felt so good before This empty place inside of me is filling up simply cannot get enough want it, oh,  want it Oh,  want it for my own 've got to know 've got to know What is this place that  have found
What is this
Christmas Town, hmm
Ho Ho Ho Ho ho ho ho ho hmm
[Halloweentown] This has never happened before
Witch It's suspicious
Witch (little) It's peculiar
It's scary
Stand aside
grrrr Coming through
We've got find Jack
There's only 365 days left till next Halloween
364
Is there anywhere we've forgotten to check
Clown looked in every mausoleum
We opened the sarcophagi
Hyde tromped through the pumpkin patch
peeked behind the Cyclops's eye
did
But he wasn't there
It's time to sound the alarms
[
's castle] Frog's breath will overpower any odor
Bitter
[coughing]  Worm's wart
Where's that worm's wart
Sally, that soup ready yet
Coming
lunch Ah, what's that
Worm's wart, mmm, and
frog's breath
What's wrong
- thought you liked frog's breath
Nothing's more suspicious than frog's breath
Until you taste it  won't swallow a spoonful
'm not hungry
[knocking spoon]  Oops
You want me to starve
An old man like me who hardly has strength as it is
Me, to whom you owe your very life
Oh don't be silly
[eats soup with trick spoon]  Mmmm, see
Scrumptious
[Dr
Finkelstein eats soup] [Halloween] Did anyone think to dredge the lake
Ah, this morning
barks Witch Hear that
Witch (little) What
Witch Shh
barks Zero
[fanfare as Jack and Zero arrive] Kid Jack's back
Where have you been
Call a town meeting and 'll tell everyone all about it
When
Immediately
[in his mayor truck] Town meeting, town meeting, town meeting tonight, town meeting tonight [at meeting] Clown [giggles as he hits Sally] Listen everyone
want to tell you about Christmastown
Town Meeting Song Performed by Danny Elfman and Cast There are objects so peculiar They were not to be believed All around, things to tantalize my brain It's a world unlike anything 've ever seen And as hard as  try can't seem to describe Like a most improbable dream But you must believe when  tell you this It's as real as my skull and it does exist Here, let me show you This is a thing called a present The whole thing starts with a box box
is it steel
Are there locks
Is it filled with a pox
, , pox How delightful, a pox If you please Just a box with bright-colored paper And the whole thing's topped with a bow bow
But why
How ugly What's in it
What's in it
That's the point of the thing, not to know It's a bat Will it bend
It's a rat Will it break
Perhaps it s the head that  found in the lake Listen now, you don't understand That's not the point of Christmas land Now, pay attention We pick up an oversized sock And hang it like this on the wall Oh, yes
Does it still have a foot
Let me see, let me look Is it rotted and covered with gook
Um, let me explain There's no foot inside, but there's candy Or sometimes it's filled with small toys Small toys Do they bite
Do they snap
Or explode in a sack
Or perhaps they just spring out And scare girls and boys What a splendid idea This Christmas sounds fun fully endorse it Let's try it at once Everyone, please now, not so fast There's something here that you don't quite grasp Well,  may as well give them what they want And the best,  must confess,  have saved for the last For the ruler of this Christmas land Is a fearsome king with a deep mighty voice Least that's what 've come to understand And 've also heard it told That he's something to behold Like a lobster, huge and red When he sets out to slay with his rain gear on Carting bulging sacks with his big great arms That is, so 've heard it said And on a dark, cold night Under full moonlight He flies into a fog Like a vulture in the sky And they call him Sandy Claws Well, at least they're excited But they don't understand That special kind of feeling in Christmas land Oh, well
[Jack's house] There's got to be a logical way to explain this Xmas thing
[Dr
Finkelstein's castle] You've poisoned me for the last time you wretched girl
[locks Sally away] [dingdong] Oh my head
the door is open
Hel-lo Jack Skellington, up here my boy
Dr
need to borrow some equipment
Is that so, whatever for
'm conducting a series of experiments
How perfectly marvelous
Curiosity killed the cat, you know
know
Come on into the lab and we'll get you all fixed up
Hmm
Experiments
[Jack's house] Zero, 'm home
[Jack examines & experiments with Xmas stuff] Interesting reaction
but what does it mean
[Sally's room] [after Sally jumps to give Jack his basket
] You can come out now if you promise to behave
Sally
Sally
Oooh
Gone again
[Jack's house] [Sally gives Jack his basket and sneaks off and picks a flower which catches on fire] Jack's Obsession Performed by Danny Elfman and Cast Something's up with Jack Something's up with Jack Don't know if we're ever going to get him back He's all alone up there Locked away inside Never says a word Hope he hasn't died Something's up with Jack Something's up with Jack Christmas time is buzzing in my skull Will it let me be
cannot tell There's so many things  cannot grasp When  think 've got it, and then at last Through my bony fingers it does slip Like a snowflake in a fiery grip Something here 'm not quite getting Though  try,  keep forgetting Like a memory long since past Here in an instant, gone in a flash What does it mean
What does it mean
In these little bric-a-brac secret's waiting to be cracked These dolls and toys confuse me so Confound it all,  love it though Simple objects, nothing more But something's hidden through a door Though  do not have the key Something's there  cannot see What does it mean
What does it mean
What does it mean
Hmm
've read these Christmas books so many times know the stories and  know the rhymes know the Christmas carols all by heart My skull's so full, it's tearing me apart As often as 've read them, something's wrong So hard to put my bony finger on Or perhaps it's really not as deep As 've been led to think Am  trying much too hard
Of course
've been too close to see The answer's right in front of me Right in front of me It's simple really, very clear Like music drifting in the air Invisible, but everywhere Just because  cannot see it Doesn't mean  can't believe it You know,  think this Christmas thing It's not as tricky as it seems And why should they have all the fun
It should belong to anyone Not anyone, in fact, but me Why,  could make a Christmas tree And there's no reason  can find couldn't handle Christmas time bet  could improve it too And that's exactly what 'll do Hee,hee,hee Eureka
This year, Christmas will be ours
Patience, everyone
Jack has a special Job for each of us
Dr
Finkelstein, your Xmas assignment is ready

That all  ever wanted was to bring them something great Why does nothing ever turn out like it should
Well, what the heck,  went and did my best And, by god,  really tasted something swell And for a moment, why,  even touched the sky And at least  left some stories they can tell,  did And for the first time since  don't remember when felt just like my old bony self again And , Jack, the Pumpkin King That's right
